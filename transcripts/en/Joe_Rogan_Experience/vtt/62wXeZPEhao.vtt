<v Speaker 1>this episode of the Joe Rogan experience</v>

3
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.730
<v Speaker 1>podcast is brought to you by Luke </v>
<v Speaker 1>Massetti.com.</v>

4
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.790
<v Speaker 1>That again is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a dude,</v>

5
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:16.830
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be a cool name though.</v>

6
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.720
<v Speaker 1>My name's Lou lumosity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad attitude.</v>

7
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.150
<v Speaker 1>Is that the Internet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That helicopter?</v>

8
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.560
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's real life.</v>

9
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.230
<v Speaker 1>That's a sound effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're looking for you anymore.</v>

10
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Don't say not now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say shit.</v>

11
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.710
<v Speaker 1>Listen to Alex Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go after him.</v>

12
00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Black helicopters problems and </v>
<v Speaker 1>solutions.</v>

13
00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lumosity is a website that's designed as</v>

14
00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:47.370
<v Speaker 1>a gym for your dome as we sit here </v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking miller.</v>

15
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.040
<v Speaker 1>Highlife lumosity is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

16
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.250
<v Speaker 1>it's essentially what they've developed </v>
<v Speaker 1>is games that increase your brain's </v>

17
00:00:58.741 --> 00:01:01.950
<v Speaker 1>capacity to do things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what do I mean by that?</v>

18
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like it gets your brain in shape </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they don't come across as like being</v>

19
00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:07.890
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comes across as,</v>

20
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.060
<v Speaker 1>as games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting and it's based </v>

21
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.310
<v Speaker 1>on the science of it's called </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroplasticity.</v>

22
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.350
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.360
<v Speaker 1>the idea behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a series of questions that </v>

24
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.630
<v Speaker 1>they ask you when you sign up and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

25
00:01:20.631 --> 00:01:21.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to their website,</v>

26
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.290
<v Speaker 1>you click on get started now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you start entering all sorts of</v>

27
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.230
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what aspects of your memory are you</v>

28
00:01:28.231 --> 00:01:32.040
<v Speaker 1>trying to train?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like recalling the location of objects.</v>

29
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.360
<v Speaker 1>Can you not breathe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

30
00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:33.760
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

31
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.910
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

32
00:01:37.911 --> 00:01:39.950
<v Speaker 1>The right into the microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry man.</v>

33
00:01:39.951 --> 00:01:43.560
<v Speaker 1>I remember one makes you do things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not realize you're doing it.</v>

34
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.950
<v Speaker 1>Lumosity a has memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>

35
00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:48.570
<v Speaker 1>speed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like meaning,</v>

36
00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:50.970
<v Speaker 1>the speed of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of recognizing things,</v>

37
00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:53.490
<v Speaker 1>coming up with answers for things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flexibility,</v>

38
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 1>communicating clearly and thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside the box.</v>

39
00:01:56.011 --> 00:01:58.120
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this shit is done in,</v>

40
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.750
<v Speaker 1>in games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting stuff.</v>

41
00:02:00.751 --> 00:02:02.250
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>

42
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.820
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ever been a guy that uh,</v>

43
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of 350 pound guys out </v>

44
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.460
<v Speaker 1>there that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all of a sudden they're one 90.</v>

45
00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:16.461
<v Speaker 1>They get in shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have been to the last year with </v>

46
00:02:16.461 --> 00:02:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Robert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robert Bradley was 350 pounds.</v>

47
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.940
<v Speaker 1>It's 190 pounds now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's amazing because he cut out soda and</v>

48
00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:25.941
<v Speaker 1>he started training Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with this luminosity thing that </v>

49
00:02:25.941 --> 00:02:25.941
<v Speaker 1>you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if,</v>

50
00:02:25.941 --> 00:02:27.810
<v Speaker 1>what if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if you start like,</v>

51
00:02:27.811 --> 00:02:29.280
<v Speaker 1>you know these dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know certain,</v>

52
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.640
<v Speaker 1>you know this guy joe or whatever is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>idiot and all of a sudden he gets into </v>

53
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.730
<v Speaker 1>these games and he's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent.</v>

54
00:02:35.731 --> 00:02:38.580
<v Speaker 1>He's like Graham Hancock and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think there'll be guys like that.</v>

55
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.330
<v Speaker 1>I think it's possible to increase your </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity slightly.</v>

56
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.390
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know how dumb I am,</v>

57
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.220
<v Speaker 1>so I know like when it comes to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever talked to a mathematician?</v>

58
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.320
<v Speaker 1>A in sixth grade I've had conversations </v>
<v Speaker 1>with mathematicians,</v>

59
00:02:55.321 --> 00:03:00.321
<v Speaker 1>just random guys that have met places </v>
<v Speaker 1>and start talking to them about that </v>

60
00:03:00.321 --> 00:03:00.321
<v Speaker 1>fucking goodwill hunting</v>

61
00:03:00.321 --> 00:03:05.100
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they write on the chalkboard and </v>

62
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.430
<v Speaker 2>all those weird fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew what it meant and Algebra because</v>

63
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.400
<v Speaker 2>Algebra was kind of easy to me and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was all that shit,</v>

64
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.540
<v Speaker 2>but I don't remember what it means now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

65
00:03:11.541 --> 00:03:13.570
<v Speaker 2>I think this is what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

66
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.520
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is where lumosity comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>into this,</v>

67
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 2>is that when you do something a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get in shape for that thing and that</v>

68
00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:20.650
<v Speaker 2>includes comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

69
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:22.480
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing comedy for 23 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but dude,</v>

70
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:25.150
<v Speaker 2>if I tell you a couple of months off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get on shaky legs.</v>

71
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.080
<v Speaker 2>If I just try to go onstage flat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to go over my material,</v>

72
00:03:29.081 --> 00:03:34.081
<v Speaker 2>I have to listen to notes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to listen to old recordings and </v>

73
00:03:34.081 --> 00:03:37.261
<v Speaker 2>get myself in the groove because my </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind's not in comedy shape and that's </v>

74
00:03:37.261 --> 00:03:37.261
<v Speaker 2>what happens.</v>

75
00:03:37.261 --> 00:03:37.990
<v Speaker 2>Like that happened to me when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>filming that show,</v>

76
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:39.820
<v Speaker 2>the Scifi show because I was doing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly.</v>

77
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:41.770
<v Speaker 2>I got out of comedy shape like I could </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel it.</v>

78
00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:46.771
<v Speaker 2>I could feel onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was awful little and I think that </v>

79
00:03:46.771 --> 00:03:49.510
<v Speaker 2>mathematics especially is one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you get into and you build a</v>

80
00:03:49.511 --> 00:03:51.940
<v Speaker 2>base,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you build a base and understanding of,</v>

81
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>simple stuff like simple arithmetic,</v>

82
00:03:55.031 --> 00:03:57.270
<v Speaker 2>simple subtraction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you start dividing things.</v>

83
00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.290
<v Speaker 2>Then you start getting into Algebra and </v>
<v Speaker 2>equations in Calculus and you need that </v>

84
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.290
<v Speaker 2>base.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need like you to need,</v>

85
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.200
<v Speaker 2>got to be in shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just get into a Jujitsu gym </v>

86
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.571
<v Speaker 2>and roll with Eddie Bravo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta have some fucking training </v>

87
00:04:09.571 --> 00:04:12.301
<v Speaker 2>behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to build your conditioning </v>

88
00:04:12.301 --> 00:04:12.301
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to get somewhere.</v>

89
00:04:12.301 --> 00:04:12.301
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like that with everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>you do,</v>

90
00:04:12.301 --> 00:04:17.281
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I remember I had a multiply numbers </v>

91
00:04:17.281 --> 00:04:17.860
<v Speaker 2>and Adam and subtract them and light </v>
<v Speaker 2>them up.</v>

92
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.690
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the division,</v>

93
00:04:19.691 --> 00:04:24.640
<v Speaker 2>you know when you put them in a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>345 divided into 17,000,</v>

94
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:27.470
<v Speaker 2>212,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how the fuck do you do that?</v>

95
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.820
<v Speaker 2>You start over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start on the top of that house and </v>

96
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.140
<v Speaker 2>where do the decimal points go out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to do that shit no </v>

97
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.140
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

98
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.900
<v Speaker 2>That's where it stops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those things,</v>

99
00:04:37.901 --> 00:04:39.880
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you just gotTa do it all the time.</v>

100
00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:43.150
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be a part of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's not a part of your life,</v>

101
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.530
<v Speaker 2>it's too slippery with Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's where the comedy.</v>

102
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.000
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the way with anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>

103
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.060
<v Speaker 2>I think most people forget that shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this division because I'm sure </v>

104
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.960
<v Speaker 2>you'll probably fuck up yo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fuck up.</v>

105
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.970
<v Speaker 2>Simple point of is there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it important to learn how to do it </v>

106
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.050
<v Speaker 2>even though you're going to forget it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>

107
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.140
<v Speaker 2>Is that just an exercise of the mind?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the actual division process in </v>

108
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.040
<v Speaker 2>and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just you're,</v>

109
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.690
<v Speaker 2>you're young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're 12,</v>

110
00:05:10.691 --> 00:05:12.670
<v Speaker 2>you're 13,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're working out the mind.</v>

111
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.550
<v Speaker 2>We know they're going to forget it when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they grow older,</v>

112
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.560
<v Speaker 2>but you need that workout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it for that or are you supposed to </v>

113
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.681
<v Speaker 2>remember how to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when you take time off of </v>

114
00:05:22.681 --> 00:05:22.681
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just forget how to do them.</v>

115
00:05:22.681 --> 00:05:23.740
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went for a long period of time where I</v>

116
00:05:23.741 --> 00:05:24.970
<v Speaker 2>didn't play pool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

117
00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:26.740
<v Speaker 2>I used to play pool eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 hours a day.</v>

118
00:05:26.741 --> 00:05:27.970
<v Speaker 2>When I lived in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was upset.</v>

119
00:05:27.971 --> 00:05:29.290
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to be a professional pool </v>
<v Speaker 2>player.</v>

120
00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:34.000
<v Speaker 2>I was obsessed and then I took like </v>
<v Speaker 2>years off and I started playing again in</v>

121
00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:39.001
<v Speaker 2>like 2006 or something after I did a TV </v>
<v Speaker 2>show and I was fucking terrible.</v>

122
00:05:39.221 --> 00:05:41.140
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what I was doing.</v>

123
00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:45.250
<v Speaker 2>I just lost all my information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it all went away,</v>

124
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.170
<v Speaker 2>but I was playing eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 hours a day.</v>

125
00:05:47.171 --> 00:05:48.670
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was pretty decent.</v>

126
00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:53.020
<v Speaker 2>I was a decent like b player and then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>just was Tara f player.</v>

127
00:05:53.021 --> 00:05:55.300
<v Speaker 2>As soon as I came back I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where did it all go?</v>

128
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.890
<v Speaker 2>Why did I forget how to do everything?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Methods,</v>

129
00:05:57.891 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

130
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.240
<v Speaker 3>methods of science thing right up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right up on may have math.</v>

131
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.710
<v Speaker 3>Math to me is a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a science.</v>

132
00:06:02.711 --> 00:06:04.880
<v Speaker 3>It's very complex like I think you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>born with it.</v>

133
00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:10.260
<v Speaker 3>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a serious set of skills that you </v>

134
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.260
<v Speaker 3>have to constantly keep working on it if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to perfect it.</v>

135
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.680
<v Speaker 3>One thing about mathematicians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they never argued with each other and </v>

136
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.680
<v Speaker 3>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

137
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.680
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is going to happen.</v>

138
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.730
<v Speaker 3>To be mathematicians are just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

139
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.250
<v Speaker 3>it's right on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't argue the math is correct.</v>

140
00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.500
<v Speaker 3>All this is going to do is look at it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you'd be like,</v>

141
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:22.490
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's correct.</v>

142
00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.780
<v Speaker 3>The same thing with this lumosity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is so crazy because to me that's </v>

143
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.271
<v Speaker 3>like science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>science is basically telling you to put </v>

144
00:06:31.271 --> 00:06:31.271
<v Speaker 3>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain,</v>

145
00:06:31.271 --> 00:06:31.271
<v Speaker 3>your neurological patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your thoughts,</v>

146
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.610
<v Speaker 3>everything on a computer and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists are able to study that like </v>

147
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.481
<v Speaker 3>what do most people like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are they going to do this and </v>

148
00:06:40.481 --> 00:06:42.431
<v Speaker 3>they're going to start putting it into </v>
<v Speaker 3>categories because there's these </v>

149
00:06:42.431 --> 00:06:45.031
<v Speaker 3>scientists out there right now that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically learning how to control </v>

150
00:06:45.031 --> 00:06:48.101
<v Speaker 3>computers through through one's brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they think that your brain is going </v>

151
00:06:48.101 --> 00:06:48.101
<v Speaker 3>to be a part of the computer one day for</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>

152
00:06:48.101 --> 00:06:50.840
<v Speaker 3>and it's all going to be that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>computer is actually going to be you.</v>

153
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.020
<v Speaker 3>And I think with this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lumosity is a huge step in that era,</v>

154
00:06:54.021 --> 00:06:55.430
<v Speaker 3>which is like a science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a math,</v>

155
00:06:55.431 --> 00:06:57.800
<v Speaker 3>I think it says building on computers or</v>
<v Speaker 3>the next.</v>

156
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.250
<v Speaker 3>You can't deny him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

157
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:04.270
<v Speaker 3>we've grown so much through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through computers in this and this </v>

158
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:04.270
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's only gonna get more advanced.</v>

159
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:05.090
<v Speaker 3>It's going to get a lot more technical </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot more bizarre.</v>

160
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:10.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea of designing programs that </v>

161
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.841
<v Speaker 1>and he enhanced your brain the same way </v>
<v Speaker 1>you would design something that would </v>

162
00:07:12.841 --> 00:07:13.810
<v Speaker 1>work out a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you have a real good point about</v>

163
00:07:13.811 --> 00:07:16.480
<v Speaker 1>mathematicians to because they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>argue about shit.</v>

164
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:19.810
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty pretty black and white if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can understand the math,</v>

165
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.230
<v Speaker 1>but it gets so squirrely that some guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't even understand the math.</v>

166
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:28.400
<v Speaker 1>Like it gets to this weird super complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>area like where they have these million </v>

167
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.861
<v Speaker 1>dollar prizes to solve problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there was this one crazy Russian </v>

168
00:07:31.861 --> 00:07:34.750
<v Speaker 1>cat that apparently he wanted but didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want the money to remember that shit.</v>

169
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:40.050
<v Speaker 1>That story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some Russian dude is solve this long </v>

170
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.010
<v Speaker 1>term mathematical problem and he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even want the money.</v>

171
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.220
<v Speaker 1>It was like a million dollar prize or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something ridiculous behind it.</v>

172
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:50.430
<v Speaker 1>But he was just obsessed with solving </v>
<v Speaker 1>these complex riddles of numbers and he </v>

173
00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:52.330
<v Speaker 1>lived in that world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world of numbers.</v>

174
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:57.000
<v Speaker 3>How crazy is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That that is the pinnacle of,</v>

175
00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:02.060
<v Speaker 3>of intellect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know shit about it.</v>

176
00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:05.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's like.</v>

177
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:09.320
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like it's almost to fully </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand.</v>

178
00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:13.700
<v Speaker 3>No one knows exactly what we're about </v>
<v Speaker 3>and how the fuck we're why we're here,</v>

179
00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:18.701
<v Speaker 3>but it's going to have something to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>with them damn numbers that they're </v>

180
00:08:18.701 --> 00:08:18.701
<v Speaker 3>working on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

181
00:08:18.701 --> 00:08:20.660
<v Speaker 3>It's like the meaning of the universe </v>
<v Speaker 3>has something,</v>

182
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:25.990
<v Speaker 3>there's a connection and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're closer to figuring it out than </v>

183
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:25.990
<v Speaker 3>we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

184
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:27.470
<v Speaker 3>that's what life's about is really </v>
<v Speaker 3>connected,</v>

185
00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:29.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as far as connecting to punch,</v>

186
00:08:29.631 --> 00:08:31.110
<v Speaker 3>connecting to triangle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole world,</v>

187
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:36.180
<v Speaker 3>not connecting the dots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And math is the true science to it </v>

188
00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:37.000
<v Speaker 3>because most people can't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So automatically like,</v>

189
00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:37.880
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy's crazy.</v>

190
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:39.770
<v Speaker 1>So basically none of us in this room are</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>

191
00:08:39.771 --> 00:08:44.771
<v Speaker 1>The true science of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just fucking shitting ourselves </v>

192
00:08:44.771 --> 00:08:44.771
<v Speaker 1>and jerking off.</v>

193
00:08:44.771 --> 00:08:44.771
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

194
00:08:44.771 --> 00:08:46.860
<v Speaker 3>When you look at people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

195
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:52.020
<v Speaker 3>reproduction is very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very key to our species out there that </v>

196
00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.000
<v Speaker 3>could look at science though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They see the signs and they still,</v>

197
00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.370
<v Speaker 3>they still wrote they're smart as hell.</v>

198
00:08:56.380 --> 00:09:01.380
<v Speaker 4>They'd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they look at the science and they still </v>

199
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.430
<v Speaker 4>don't see it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if it was put in this put in math,</v>

200
00:09:02.431 --> 00:09:05.130
<v Speaker 4>like you put it in numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to accept it.</v>

201
00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:07.560
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Except the numbers,</v>

202
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.510
<v Speaker 4>all that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

203
00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:14.620
<v Speaker 4>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll check to see if your theory's </v>

204
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:14.620
<v Speaker 4>Ryan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it isn't,</v>

205
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:14.620
<v Speaker 4>it basically becomes like a law of </v>
<v Speaker 4>gravity.</v>

206
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.920
<v Speaker 4>It's set in stone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no arguing with it.</v>

207
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.370
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a law.</v>

208
00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.680
<v Speaker 4>If you throw something up in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to fall down and he's like,</v>

209
00:09:19.681 --> 00:09:21.840
<v Speaker 4>so no bias in that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

210
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:25.660
<v Speaker 4>in math there's no bias.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Interesting</v>

211
00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:26.380
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

212
00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I want to get to this on the podcast</v>

213
00:09:28.661 --> 00:09:33.661
<v Speaker 1>later when we're talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk about some numbers </v>

214
00:09:33.661 --> 00:09:33.661
<v Speaker 1>and some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

215
00:09:33.661 --> 00:09:33.910
<v Speaker 1>some different things over this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

216
00:09:33.911 --> 00:09:36.400
<v Speaker 1>go to lumosity.com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Use the code named Rogan.</v>

217
00:09:36.401 --> 00:09:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Let them know that I sent you in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>referral box and click start training.</v>

218
00:09:40.361 --> 00:09:42.370
<v Speaker 1>Create your own program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could try it out.</v>

219
00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:46.450
<v Speaker 1>It's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really fascinating website.</v>

220
00:09:46.451 --> 00:09:50.260
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a beautiful design.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the idea behind it and I love the</v>

221
00:09:50.261 --> 00:09:52.700
<v Speaker 1>idea that you can do something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

222
00:09:52.701 --> 00:09:55.390
<v Speaker 1>that you can create a fucking gym for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain.</v>

223
00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:57.790
<v Speaker 4>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They owe you triple for this commercial.</v>

224
00:09:57.791 --> 00:09:59.460
<v Speaker 4>This was 35 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

225
00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:04.470
<v Speaker 4>but these commercials are entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the whole key behind it and we </v>

226
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.470
<v Speaker 4>need more of those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>

227
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:09.350
<v Speaker 4>like the way you used to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just blazing through them in two </v>

228
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.370
<v Speaker 4>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes 30 minutes.</v>

229
00:10:09.371 --> 00:10:10.860
<v Speaker 4>That is true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes I do.</v>

<v Speaker 1>there as well.</v>

373
00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:35.040
<v Speaker 1>But the idea behind it is that cordyceps</v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms,</v>

374
00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:40.110
<v Speaker 1>they found that these high altitude </v>

<v Speaker 1>and they were like more active.</v>

376
00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.980
<v Speaker 1>So they started taking them and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>start using them.</v>

377
00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:50.990
<v Speaker 1>China used him in the Olympics and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>got a bunch of gold medals with them in </v>

378
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:52.260

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese,</v>

<v Speaker 1>women's team was using,</v>

381
00:16:55.861 --> 00:16:56.340

<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

382
00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.080
<v Speaker 1>they figured out how to use these core </v>
<v Speaker 1>steps.</v>

383
00:16:58.081 --> 00:17:03.081
<v Speaker 1>Mushrooms to run marathons says they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were running and impossible marathon </v>

384
00:17:03.751 --> 00:17:06.930

<v Speaker 1>Several world records later,</v>

385
00:17:06.931 --> 00:17:11.931
<v Speaker 1>the rumor was confirmed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rumor doping test came up negative and </v>

<v Speaker 2>How many fucking words are there online </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you know what they are when you </v>

390
00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:28.291
<v Speaker 2>read them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you see you have no idea to say </v>

391
00:17:28.291 --> 00:17:29.881
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A different story because that story </v>

392
00:17:29.881 --> 00:17:32.551

<v Speaker 2>You could go online and find that pretty</v>

395
00:17:37.241 --> 00:17:39.370
<v Speaker 2>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These supplements are the real deal.</v>

396
00:17:39.371 --> 00:17:42.970
<v Speaker 2>I think man behind this quarter</v>

397
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:48.200
<v Speaker 1>mushroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it improves oxygen utilization and the </v>

398
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:48.930
<v Speaker 1>ATP production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two critical aspects of endurance,</v>

399
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:51.580
<v Speaker 1>the endurance athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

400
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.460
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fantastic workout.</v>

401
00:17:53.461 --> 00:17:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Top of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Makes Sense.</v>

402
00:17:54.541 --> 00:17:58.170
<v Speaker 1>I could just like weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weed is good in so many different ways.</v>

403
00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.630
<v Speaker 1>It with nutrition and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mushrooms,</v>

404
00:18:00.631 --> 00:18:03.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they definitely put you in touch with,</v>

405
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other dimensions that are all on </v>

406
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:09.000

<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

408
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.820
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be careful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it makes sense.</v>

409
00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:14.900
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense that it does other shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>like physical benefits.</v>

410
00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:16.410
<v Speaker 1>That makes total sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally does.</v>

411
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's trying to rip you off.</v>

412
00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:19.950
<v Speaker 1>This is all the best shit that we could </v>
<v Speaker 1>find.</v>

413
00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:25.040
<v Speaker 1>We sell everything that we use and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a very fair policy on supplements.</v>

414
00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:28.850
<v Speaker 1>A 30 pill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>90 day money back guarantee.</v>

415
00:18:28.851 --> 00:18:29.820
<v Speaker 1>You don't even have to return it.</v>

416
00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried this shit.</v>

417
00:18:31.201 --> 00:18:33.180
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>

418
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:34.260
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fine.</v>

419
00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:34.850
<v Speaker 1>You're good.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you don't have to send anything in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get your money back because all </v>

421
00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.191
<v Speaker 1>we're doing is trying to turn you onto </v>
<v Speaker 1>some shit that we use ourselves and I </v>

422
00:18:43.191 --> 00:18:45.050
<v Speaker 1>find benefit in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that if you try it,</v>

423
00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:50.060
<v Speaker 1>you're going to enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to find benefit in it and </v>

424
00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:50.190
<v Speaker 1>you're going to realize why it costs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it costs,</v>

425
00:18:50.191 --> 00:18:53.550
<v Speaker 1>what's involved in producing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we're trying to do,</v>

426
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:58.580
<v Speaker 1>give you the highest level ingredients </v>
<v Speaker 1>available and do it like in a suit in </v>

427
00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.240
<v Speaker 1>the most ethical way possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're trying to do.</v>

428
00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

429
00:19:01.221 --> 00:19:02.270
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you fill it,</v>

430
00:19:02.271 --> 00:19:03.410

<v Speaker 3>like more older you get and the more </v>

434
00:19:11.741 --> 00:19:11.741
<v Speaker 3>better you feel you're going to start </v>
<v Speaker 3>filling a lot younger I think.</v>

435
00:19:11.741 --> 00:19:13.520
<v Speaker 3>I think it does a lot of great things </v>
<v Speaker 3>for your men mentally,</v>

436
00:19:13.521 --> 00:19:14.090
<v Speaker 3>mind,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you in the best mood.</v>

442

<v Speaker 1>development for a long time and Ssri for</v>

447
00:19:44.181 --> 00:19:49.181
<v Speaker 1>people who have depression issues or </v>
<v Speaker 1>five htp is a natural way to do that and</v>

448
00:19:49.251 --> 00:19:54.251
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the supplements that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>sell it on and it's called new mood and </v>

449
00:19:54.251 --> 00:19:57.551
<v Speaker 1>inside of new mood is five htp and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>trip to fan which converts to five htp </v>

450
00:19:57.551 --> 00:20:02.531
<v Speaker 1>in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea and being that it'll give you </v>

451
00:20:02.531 --> 00:20:02.531
<v Speaker 1>more of a time release effect.</v>

452
00:20:02.531 --> 00:20:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as what's controversial now,</v>

453
00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.790
<v Speaker 1>I've never had one person say that new </v>
<v Speaker 1>mood didn't have an effect on them.</v>

454
00:20:07.791 --> 00:20:12.791
<v Speaker 1>And I've never heard one person say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>shroom tech sport hasn't had an effect </v>

455
00:20:12.791 --> 00:20:16.811
<v Speaker 1>on a positive both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there have people that said Alpha </v>

456
00:20:16.811 --> 00:20:17.090
<v Speaker 1>brain didn't do shit for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know what that's about.</v>

457
00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:20.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean some people they work together.</v>

458
00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mood and the Alpha brain.</v>

459
00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:25.500
<v Speaker 1>Some people maybe they're not as </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitive as to what affects their brand</v>

460
00:20:25.501 --> 00:20:27.680
<v Speaker 1>or doesn't affect their brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it didn't work on them.</v>

461
00:20:27.681 --> 00:20:32.681
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they already have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a high level of nutrients in their </v>

462
00:20:32.681 --> 00:20:32.681
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't need a bump.</v>

463
00:20:32.681 --> 00:20:35.240
<v Speaker 1>I know too many people took too much </v>
<v Speaker 1>night that nighttime night,</v>

464
00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.520
<v Speaker 1>bunch of other shit.</v>

<v Speaker 3>elusive wild dreams ever.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'll use the shroom tech ran and when</v>

469
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:50.190

<v Speaker 5>you know how to get that night.</v>

487
00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:21.630
<v Speaker 5>The practices early,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

488
00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:22.900
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do have new mood,</v>

489
00:21:22.901 --> 00:21:24.180
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

490
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:29.310
<v Speaker 5>I would take it every now and then after</v>
<v Speaker 5>a late night podcasts and I'm all wound </v>

491
00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:32.070
<v Speaker 5>up and I need to get some sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I use it like to try to call it.</v>

492
00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:34.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who were into lucid dreaming,</v>

493
00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:37.290
<v Speaker 1>they've been using Alpha brain people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who there's like a whole,</v>

494
00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:42.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how people were into Jujitsu because </v>

495
00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:42.380
<v Speaker 1>people were into Lucy.</v>

496
00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:42.380
<v Speaker 5>I try to get it for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never tried it.</v>

497
00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.220
<v Speaker 5>I got to work twice for me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Railing.</v>

498
00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:49.340
<v Speaker 5>Hell yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's all these different techniques </v>

499
00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:51.740
<v Speaker 5>out there and lucid dreaming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of people who think lucid </v>

500
00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:54.660
<v Speaker 5>dreaming is like dreams that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything is crystal clear.</v>

501
00:21:54.661 --> 00:21:57.340
<v Speaker 5>And so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so like it affects them.</v>

502
00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:01.830
<v Speaker 5>It's not really that lucid dream is </v>
<v Speaker 5>knowing that you're inside a dream,</v>

503
00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:06.870
<v Speaker 5>recognizing that it's a dream and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>having the power to control everything.</v>

504
00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:09.240
<v Speaker 5>The first two steps of the levels of </v>
<v Speaker 5>dreaming,</v>

505
00:22:09.241 --> 00:22:09.870
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

506
00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:11.790
<v Speaker 5>Like when you're your mind still half </v>
<v Speaker 5>awake,</v>

507
00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:17.220
<v Speaker 5>it's when you realize you're dreaming,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know you're in a dream and you know </v>

508
00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.020
<v Speaker 5>you're sleeping and this is a dream and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you can control everything.</v>

509
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:25.470
<v Speaker 5>Then when you wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can look it up in a blood only that </v>

510
00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:25.470
<v Speaker 5>you could fly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could do anything you want.</v>

511
00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:30.900
<v Speaker 5>You are on the Matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As soon as you recognize you're in a </v>

512
00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:30.900
<v Speaker 5>dream,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you right.</v>

513
00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.700
<v Speaker 5>You have to recognize that you have the </v>
<v Speaker 5>power to do whatever you want.</v>

514
00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:37.760
<v Speaker 1>The only time I ever had a lucid dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen because of something I did was </v>

515
00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:38.190
<v Speaker 1>something I saw in a movie where a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>was saying,</v>

516
00:22:38.191 --> 00:22:41.610
<v Speaker 1>when you go through a door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should knock on the door and say,</v>

517
00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.560
<v Speaker 1>am I dreaming?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do it every day.</v>

518
00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:46.260
<v Speaker 1>When you go through doors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like whenever you go through door knock,</v>

519
00:22:46.261 --> 00:22:47.140
<v Speaker 1>knock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I dreaming?</v>

520
00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:49.740
<v Speaker 1>So that becomes like a habit when you go</v>
<v Speaker 1>through doors.</v>

521
00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.570
<v Speaker 1>So when you go through a door and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>dream.</v>

522
00:22:51.571 --> 00:22:56.571
<v Speaker 1>I did this for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I went through a door and my dream </v>

523
00:22:56.571 --> 00:22:56.571
<v Speaker 1>and I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

524
00:22:56.571 --> 00:22:56.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm dreaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

525
00:22:56.851 --> 00:22:58.790
<v Speaker 1>there's no door here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I realized I was dreaming.</v>

526
00:22:58.791 --> 00:23:01.320
<v Speaker 1>I remember this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Normally when I know that I'm dreaming,</v>

527
00:23:01.321 --> 00:23:04.020
<v Speaker 1>I'll just wake right the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I normally can't hang onto it.</v>

528
00:23:04.021 --> 00:23:06.990
<v Speaker 1>I always described dreams as being like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a really gentle bubble,</v>

529
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:12.110
<v Speaker 1>like a kids bubble where they blow </v>
<v Speaker 1>bubbles is a barely hold it in your </v>

530
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:12.960
<v Speaker 1>hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but dreaming on Nootropics,</v>

531
00:23:12.961 --> 00:23:16.650
<v Speaker 1>whether it's Alpha brain or neuro one or</v>
<v Speaker 1>new boot or any of these.</v>

532
00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:21.330
<v Speaker 1>I get these weird like rubber dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can bounce them around and move</v>

533
00:23:21.331 --> 00:23:23.220
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're durable bubbles.</v>

534
00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:25.470
<v Speaker 5>I slept with dvds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got into [inaudible].</v>

535
00:23:25.471 --> 00:23:26.930
<v Speaker 5>There's people that are really good at </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

536
00:23:26.931 --> 00:23:30.980
<v Speaker 5>There's guys that could do it every </v>
<v Speaker 5>night that masters and they look forward</v>

537
00:23:30.981 --> 00:23:34.940
<v Speaker 5>to dreaming while I was into this for </v>
<v Speaker 5>like maybe six months.</v>

538
00:23:34.941 --> 00:23:39.941
<v Speaker 5>I got into it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got a couple of dvds and you sleep </v>

539
00:23:39.941 --> 00:23:42.101
<v Speaker 5>with these dvds and they keep it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They keep waking you up like every </v>

540
00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:47.170
<v Speaker 5>couple minutes ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wake up and then it actually does you </v>

541
00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:50.471
<v Speaker 5>up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you go back to sleep and you </v>

542
00:23:50.471 --> 00:23:50.960
<v Speaker 5>get used to just sleeping through the </v>
<v Speaker 5>white cups.</v>

543
00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:55.550
<v Speaker 5>And then as soon as,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember exactly how it all goes</v>

544
00:23:55.551 --> 00:23:58.190
<v Speaker 5>down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's really,</v>

545
00:23:58.191 --> 00:24:03.191
<v Speaker 5>really hard because you've got to keep </v>
<v Speaker 5>reminding yourself you've got to keep </v>

546
00:24:03.191 --> 00:24:03.191
<v Speaker 5>thinking of a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>

547
00:24:03.191 --> 00:24:06.910
<v Speaker 5>a certain place and then you can do all </v>
<v Speaker 5>that other stuff where you knock on it </v>

548
00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:08.660
<v Speaker 5>every time we walked through a door,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you asked herself on my dreaming in your</v>

549
00:24:08.661 --> 00:24:10.460
<v Speaker 5>everyday life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that becomes really hard.</v>

550
00:24:10.461 --> 00:24:12.110
<v Speaker 5>Like you forget,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get lazy,</v>

551
00:24:12.111 --> 00:24:13.220
<v Speaker 5>you don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's hard.</v>

552
00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:17.240
<v Speaker 5>So I was able to do it twice a with </v>
<v Speaker 5>these dvds.</v>

553
00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:20.900
<v Speaker 5>There's all these instructions and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>talk to you and they try to wake you up.</v>

554
00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:26.380
<v Speaker 5>And it worked out of maybe 40 times that</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went to bed doing these exercises,</v>

555
00:24:27.031 --> 00:24:29.860
<v Speaker 5>these mental drills.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

556
00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:32.090
<v Speaker 5>it worked twice and it was pretty </v>
<v Speaker 5>awesome,</v>

557
00:24:32.091 --> 00:24:32.520
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

558
00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:36.130
<v Speaker 3>and the two things that everyone does </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can do with breathing,</v>

559
00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:38.620
<v Speaker 3>the [inaudible] you have fight or </v>
<v Speaker 3>flight,</v>

560
00:24:38.621 --> 00:24:43.621
<v Speaker 3>so when you're all fight or flight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you get home from a late night work </v>

561
00:24:43.621 --> 00:24:46.291
<v Speaker 3>out or you just beasts in the Joe Rogan </v>
<v Speaker 3>on it kettlebells feeling like a beast </v>

562
00:24:46.291 --> 00:24:47.650
<v Speaker 3>and you're at night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could be tired,</v>

563
00:24:47.651 --> 00:24:50.120
<v Speaker 3>but your body's still reacting to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight or flight mode.</v>

564
00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.090
<v Speaker 3>We just did this workout.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are we going to do next?</v>

565
00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:55.380
<v Speaker 3>And if you actually take time and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>slow down your breathing,</v>

566
00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.430
<v Speaker 3>you tell your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

567
00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:59.170
<v Speaker 3>your nervous system to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to slow down.</v>

568
00:24:59.171 --> 00:25:00.100
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's time to relax,</v>

569
00:25:00.101 --> 00:25:01.690
<v Speaker 3>which actually releases natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>hormones,</v>

570
00:25:01.691 --> 00:25:04.040
<v Speaker 3>which I'm sure you're capable of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in,</v>

571
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:09.230
<v Speaker 3>in dreams I've had dreams on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on these type of supplements where I </v>

572
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:11.440
<v Speaker 3>felt like I could literally push off the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ground and I was flying in the air and I</v>

573
00:25:11.441 --> 00:25:13.030
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kept telling myself when I woke up,</v>

574
00:25:13.031 --> 00:25:13.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

575
00:25:13.391 --> 00:25:14.080
<v Speaker 3>I got to remember that.</v>

576
00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.910
<v Speaker 3>So I tell myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost like you're knock on the door.</v>

577
00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.610
<v Speaker 3>Remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was,</v>

578
00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:22.980
<v Speaker 3>I was transforming in these dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'd fly here and then I would go </v>

579
00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:23.980
<v Speaker 3>somewhere else and when I remember that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I looked it up and it was like,</v>

580
00:25:23.981 --> 00:25:26.710
<v Speaker 3>you're in control of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can control your destiny.</v>

581
00:25:26.711 --> 00:25:29.480
<v Speaker 3>Right now it's like all about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So sometimes I'd have like some good,</v>

582
00:25:29.481 --> 00:25:32.470
<v Speaker 3>like positive results and then like </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's like a,</v>

583
00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:37.500
<v Speaker 3>you got bit by something and then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>gotta like look it up and it's just </v>

584
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:37.500
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

585
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:37.500
<v Speaker 3>you're just going through a rough one </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

586
00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:37.870
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have no doubt.</v>

587
00:25:37.871 --> 00:25:40.750
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So have interpretations.</v>

588
00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:42.280
<v Speaker 3>They have interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know what the.</v>

589
00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:44.770
<v Speaker 3>I think they're guessing like a mother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's insane.</v>

590
00:25:44.771 --> 00:25:46.900
<v Speaker 3>No way dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Grab,</v>

591
00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:51.930
<v Speaker 3>grab a book of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a dream book from anywhere and just </v>

592
00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:52.240
<v Speaker 3>just try to tell yourself to either </v>
<v Speaker 3>knock on the door,</v>

593
00:25:52.241 --> 00:25:57.241
<v Speaker 3>remember this dream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wake up and either you can even Google </v>

594
00:25:57.241 --> 00:25:58.150
<v Speaker 3>this dream interpretations and you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>really look up your dreams.</v>

595
00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:59.770
<v Speaker 3>Some of them are like a little bit off </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ball,</v>

596
00:25:59.771 --> 00:26:00.910
<v Speaker 3>but some of them you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

597
00:26:00.911 --> 00:26:05.911
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had more than on both hands of </v>

598
00:26:05.911 --> 00:26:06.430
<v Speaker 3>dreams that I can remember were like I </v>
<v Speaker 3>looked it up and it like maybe something</v>

599
00:26:06.431 --> 00:26:08.860
<v Speaker 3>hit while you're talking about knowing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're in a dream,</v>

600
00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.830
<v Speaker 3>dream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dream,</v>

601
00:26:11.831 --> 00:26:13.790
<v Speaker 3>and then he finds the interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does it mean</v>

602
00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:16.880
<v Speaker 5>in the dream going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>

603
00:26:16.881 --> 00:26:17.690
<v Speaker 5>I'm in a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can.</v>

604
00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:22.960
<v Speaker 5>Once people realize their dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the two most common things that they do </v>

605
00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:26.590
<v Speaker 5>fly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everyone flies right away and have sex </v>

606
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.590
<v Speaker 5>immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

607
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:28.220
<v Speaker 5>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you and the two times I did it,</v>

608
00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:31.730
<v Speaker 5>I remember when the first time this DVD </v>
<v Speaker 5>worked,</v>

609
00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:33.140
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

610
00:26:33.141 --> 00:26:33.800
<v Speaker 5>I'm dreaming.</v>

611
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.910
<v Speaker 3>Let's get to the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to end this commercial.</v>

612
00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:39.430
<v Speaker 3>This is a commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Use a code name.</v>

613

<v Speaker 3>up,</v>

614
00:26:41.031 --> 00:26:41.860
<v Speaker 3>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom,</v>

615
00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:43.780
<v Speaker 3>o n n and it will talk about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

616
00:26:43.781 --> 00:26:44.050
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll</v>

617
00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:46.200
<v Speaker 1>just go right into it because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want people to mess us.</v>

618
00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:46.980
<v Speaker 1>Hit it.</v>

619
00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:56.320
<v Speaker 5>Joe Rogan experience podcast</v>

620
00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:01.120
<v Speaker 1>commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just too good.</v>

621
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:06.190
<v Speaker 1>I had A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to stop and just make the podcast </v>

622
00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:08.381
<v Speaker 1>live because on Sirius satellite radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of that other stuff will go on </v>

623
00:27:08.381 --> 00:27:09.410
<v Speaker 1>because it's all the commercials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but talking about we were talking.</v>

624
00:27:09.411 --> 00:27:14.411
<v Speaker 1>I'm here with Jeremy Stevens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little heathen in the house and the </v>

625
00:27:14.411 --> 00:27:14.411
<v Speaker 1>Great Eddie Bravo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my brother.</v>

626
00:27:14.411 --> 00:27:15.410
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're uh,</v>

627
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:16.970
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk about the UFC for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

628
00:27:16.971 --> 00:27:19.670
<v Speaker 1>But right now we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>lucid dreaming and Eddie was bringing up</v>

629
00:27:19.671 --> 00:27:21.650
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

630
00:27:21.651 --> 00:27:24.680
<v Speaker 1>if you study like methods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's books that they have.</v>

631
00:27:24.681 --> 00:27:29.681
<v Speaker 1>There's exercises you can do where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can try to figure out how to get </v>

632
00:27:29.681 --> 00:27:31.430
<v Speaker 1>yourself in a state where you can have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lucid dream.</v>

633
00:27:31.431 --> 00:27:32.320
<v Speaker 1>And you did it a couple times.</v>

634
00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.640
<v Speaker 5>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lucid dreams.</v>

635
00:27:33.641 --> 00:27:36.220
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people think lucid dreams are </v>
<v Speaker 5>crystal clear dreams.</v>

636
00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:39.460
<v Speaker 5>Lucid dreaming is when you know you are </v>
<v Speaker 5>dreaming.</v>

637
00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.950
<v Speaker 5>Not a crystal clear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>profound dream.</v>

638
00:27:41.951 --> 00:27:43.960
<v Speaker 5>It's when you figure out you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>dreaming,</v>

639
00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:47.830
<v Speaker 5>you can control everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything becomes super clear.</v>

640
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:49.390
<v Speaker 5>Like all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Once I figured it out,</v>

641
00:27:49.391 --> 00:27:51.450
<v Speaker 5>I was dreaming it and it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All these,</v>

642
00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:56.550
<v Speaker 5>these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this DVD talks to you while you're </v>

643
00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:58.411
<v Speaker 5>sleeping and then it wakes you up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's trying to wake you up in your </v>

644
00:27:58.411 --> 00:27:58.411
<v Speaker 5>dream.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're dreaming,</v>

645
00:27:58.411 --> 00:27:58.411
<v Speaker 5>wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're dreaming,</v>

646
00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.620
<v Speaker 5>you're dreaming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wake up,</v>

647
00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:02.080
<v Speaker 5>control this DVD.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're saying that,</v>

648
00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:04.720
<v Speaker 5>so you go to sleep with this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that what you're doing?</v>

649
00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.610
<v Speaker 5>There's all these mental exercises you </v>
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>

650
00:28:06.611 --> 00:28:09.280
<v Speaker 5>You have to think of a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're on an island with,</v>

651
00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:12.310
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>think about the person you want to dream</v>

652
00:28:12.311 --> 00:28:14.400
<v Speaker 5>with and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's really hard.</v>

653
00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.370
<v Speaker 5>It's easier just to go to fucking sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What if you got to,</v>

654
00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:21.320
<v Speaker 1>if it's a five DVD series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to like DVD number five and it's</v>

655
00:28:21.321 --> 00:28:26.321
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to come to my house and </v>

656
00:28:26.321 --> 00:28:26.321
<v Speaker 1>you're going to unzip my</v>

657
00:28:26.321 --> 00:28:28.750
<v Speaker 5>pants and you're going to suck my cock.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's programming you program with </v>

658
00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:30.320
<v Speaker 5>people across the country.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Guys blow jobs,</v>

659
00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:32.840
<v Speaker 5>but the two most popular things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot.</v>

660
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:35.700
<v Speaker 5>There's black belts at lucid dreaming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you have the,</v>

661
00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:38.270
<v Speaker 5>the men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a mental exercise and you just want</v>

662
00:28:38.271 --> 00:28:40.790
<v Speaker 5>to go to sleep on at night,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's very hard to do.</v>

663
00:28:40.791 --> 00:28:45.791
<v Speaker 5>You have to be militant and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be sharpened in know while you're tired </v>

664
00:28:45.791 --> 00:28:46.760
<v Speaker 5>and ready to go to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's hard,</v>

665
00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.810
<v Speaker 5>but it worked a couple of times for me </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the two things that most people like</v>

666
00:28:50.811 --> 00:28:55.811
<v Speaker 5>doing or flying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As soon as they figured out there in a </v>

667
00:28:55.811 --> 00:28:55.811
<v Speaker 5>dream,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they go,</v>

668
00:28:55.811 --> 00:28:55.811
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm gonna fly,</v>

669
00:28:55.811 --> 00:28:57.320
<v Speaker 5>come flying shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then sex.</v>

670
00:28:57.321 --> 00:29:02.321
<v Speaker 5>They go right to sex.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's true because the two times it </v>

671
00:29:02.321 --> 00:29:04.661
<v Speaker 5>worked for me and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and when I used to have lucid dreams as </v>

672
00:29:04.661 --> 00:29:05.330
<v Speaker 5>a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I actually had him when I was a kid once</v>

673
00:29:05.331 --> 00:29:10.331
<v Speaker 5>or twice a year and I'm talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>being like eight or nine years old and </v>

674
00:29:10.331 --> 00:29:14.680
<v Speaker 5>the first thing I wanted to do with just</v>
<v Speaker 5>like find a girl and make out with her </v>

675
00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:14.870
<v Speaker 5>and just like humber wasn't a weird </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

676
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:16.040
<v Speaker 5>It was a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>

677
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:17.960
<v Speaker 5>I was a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a weird thing.</v>

678
00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:21.080
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to go look for girls and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>remember these lucid dreams.</v>

679
00:29:21.081 --> 00:29:22.640
<v Speaker 5>I remember a couple I'll never forget.</v>

680
00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:25.540
<v Speaker 1>Amazing that when your hormones are at </v>
<v Speaker 1>your highest,</v>

681
00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:28.330
<v Speaker 1>that's when you're the youngest and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dumbest and not able to.</v>

682
00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:33.910
<v Speaker 5>When you're 13,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're shit is killing you all day.</v>

683
00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:39.380
<v Speaker 1>Baffled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you went through your whole </v>

684
00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:41.511
<v Speaker 1>life feeling like pretty much the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>dude just slowly growing and then all </v>

685
00:29:41.511 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 1>the sudden you hit 30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You</v>

<v Speaker 5>In high school we did is hard all day.</v>

687

<v Speaker 5>and God forbid you find a girl's willing</v>

<v Speaker 5>Like she.</v>

690
00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:55.990
<v Speaker 5>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're a drug dealer,</v>

691
00:29:56.260 --> 00:30:01.260
<v Speaker 5>you're a crack addict and she's your </v>
<v Speaker 5>drug dealer and you're hanging around </v>

692
00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:03.721
<v Speaker 5>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No matter what state became believe </v>

693
00:30:03.721 --> 00:30:03.970
<v Speaker 5>different things to hang out with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A girl when the fuck did that,</v>

694
00:30:03.971 --> 00:30:08.971
<v Speaker 5>I haven't ever just make an out because </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be making off while I'm </v>

695
00:30:08.971 --> 00:30:08.971
<v Speaker 5>making it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Awesome.</v>

696
00:30:08.971 --> 00:30:09.890
<v Speaker 5>You just want to make an offer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to go to movies just to make out.</v>

697
00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:11.510
<v Speaker 5>Just like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck them over.</v>

698
00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:16.790
<v Speaker 5>Just make out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the only private spot at 13 that </v>

699
00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:16.790
<v Speaker 5>you could find dark,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but anyway,</v>

700
00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:17.410
<v Speaker 5>it's about these dreams.</v>

701
00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:20.740
<v Speaker 5>I ended up doing it twice and that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>what I did the first time.</v>

702
00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.590
<v Speaker 5>As soon as I figured out I was dreamed </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you are dreaming and I'm like,</v>

703
00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:28.800
<v Speaker 5>I am dreaming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything became really bright and </v>

704
00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:28.800
<v Speaker 5>immediately I flew with my hands down </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that,</v>

705
00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:32.800
<v Speaker 5>like fucking ironman through canyons and</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was so bright and all I kept thinking</v>

706
00:30:32.801 --> 00:30:35.650
<v Speaker 5>was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe this is a dream.</v>

707
00:30:35.651 --> 00:30:38.230
<v Speaker 5>This is so clear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's just so vivid.</v>

708
00:30:38.231 --> 00:30:41.370
<v Speaker 5>That's all I was thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dreams are amazing.</v>

709
00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:43.440
<v Speaker 5>I'm flying through king.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like iron man.</v>

710
00:30:43.441 --> 00:30:44.170
<v Speaker 5>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

711
00:30:44.171 --> 00:30:46.360
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to have sex now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this is when I was single.</v>

712
00:30:46.361 --> 00:30:51.361
<v Speaker 5>This is before I was married.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I was a single man so immediately </v>

713
00:30:51.521 --> 00:30:53.380
<v Speaker 5>from the sea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember like a video.</v>

714
00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:58.500
<v Speaker 5>I descended from the candidate into the </v>
<v Speaker 5>canyons and up came this girl hiker,</v>

715
00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:04.260
<v Speaker 5>this hot girl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and she just smiled at me like a dream </v>

716
00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:04.260
<v Speaker 5>in a movie.</v>

717
00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:05.080
<v Speaker 5>Like if this was in a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I came down into the canyon,</v>

718
00:31:05.081 --> 00:31:06.130
<v Speaker 5>she's hiking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's hot,</v>

719
00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:11.340
<v Speaker 5>and we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I take off her clothes and we start the </v>

720
00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:11.560
<v Speaker 5>love making and I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I remember thinking,</v>

721
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:16.480
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe this is a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see this is soul real.</v>

722
00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:18.950
<v Speaker 5>And then Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I woke up with a vicious boner.</v>

723
00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:19.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right there.</v>

724
00:31:19.991 --> 00:31:22.270
<v Speaker 5>I woke up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was so crystal clear.</v>

725
00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:23.710
<v Speaker 5>I just got too excited.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

726
00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:26.260
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe like I'm having sex </v>
<v Speaker 5>right now.</v>

727
00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:28.470
<v Speaker 5>That's always been my issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Coming all the time,</v>

728
00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:35.140
<v Speaker 5>but not really been my issue with lucid </v>
<v Speaker 5>dreams that they go away too easy </v>

729
00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:36.550
<v Speaker 5>because you get excited because I can't </v>
<v Speaker 5>believe you're dreaming.</v>

730
00:31:36.551 --> 00:31:41.551
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know that all you gotta do is </v>

731
00:31:41.551 --> 00:31:41.551
<v Speaker 5>open your eyes and then you start </v>
<v Speaker 5>opening your goddamn eyes.</v>

732
00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:43.240
<v Speaker 4>Those supplements had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

733
00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:45.220
<v Speaker 4>hit the sprint program that we're on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling you,</v>

734
00:31:45.221 --> 00:31:50.221
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll dream amazing sprint program and </v>

735
00:31:50.221 --> 00:31:50.590
<v Speaker 4>you want just the alliance sprint </v>
<v Speaker 4>program.</v>

736
00:31:50.591 --> 00:31:52.690
<v Speaker 4>What's the alliance print program?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

737
00:31:52.691 --> 00:31:55.150
<v Speaker 4>it's basically just for like the first </v>
<v Speaker 4>minute,</v>

738
00:31:55.151 --> 00:31:56.680
<v Speaker 4>15 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're running by her,</v>

739
00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:59.710
<v Speaker 4>by herself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got a 15 incline treadmill,</v>

740
00:31:59.711 --> 00:32:01.380
<v Speaker 4>sprinting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a treadmill,</v>

741
00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:03.880
<v Speaker 4>sprinting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then we also do a 400 meters,</v>

742
00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:06.430
<v Speaker 4>a 15 times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so running around the track.</v>

743
00:32:06.431 --> 00:32:11.431
<v Speaker 4>That's one sprint.</v>
<v Speaker 4>15 Times 55 52nd rest and then again </v>

744
00:32:11.431 --> 00:32:15.691
<v Speaker 4>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is something that everyone on </v>

745
00:32:15.691 --> 00:32:15.691
<v Speaker 4>the team does pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

746
00:32:15.691 --> 00:32:15.691
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>

747
00:32:15.691 --> 00:32:20.100
<v Speaker 4>Is that unique to an MMA camp that a </v>
<v Speaker 4>team has a single a strength and </v>

748
00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:21.700
<v Speaker 4>conditioning protocol that everybody </v>
<v Speaker 4>follows like a.</v>

749
00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:24.850
<v Speaker 4>I think it's very important to follow a </v>
<v Speaker 4>set structure.</v>

750
00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:25.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

751
00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:26.260
<v Speaker 4>you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

752
00:32:26.261 --> 00:32:28.690
<v Speaker 4>the ground rules is kind of like how </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about the math program the</v>

753
00:32:28.691 --> 00:32:31.240
<v Speaker 4>other day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the lumosity stuff.</v>

754
00:32:31.241 --> 00:32:34.270
<v Speaker 4>You just basically just set a good </v>
<v Speaker 4>foundation if you have good stability,</v>

755
00:32:34.271 --> 00:32:36.000
<v Speaker 4>good foundation I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's,</v>

756
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 4>you're a lot more easier to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can do a lot of MMA camps have</v>

757
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.720
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they have like a sprint series that</v>

758
00:32:41.721 --> 00:32:44.170
<v Speaker 1>the whole camp we'll do every week or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

759
00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:46.000
<v Speaker 1>strength and conditioning series that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole camp.</v>

760
00:32:46.001 --> 00:32:46.910
<v Speaker 1>We'll do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I imagine,</v>

761
00:32:46.911 --> 00:32:48.620
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've heard of Greg Jackson,</v>

762
00:32:48.621 --> 00:32:51.530
<v Speaker 1>I think he's real famous for is a sandal</v>
<v Speaker 1>domes.</v>

763
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:52.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

764
00:32:52.331 --> 00:32:53.000
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

765
00:32:53.001 --> 00:32:54.200
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>

766
00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:59.480
<v Speaker 1>that's a good one you see by like Carlos</v>
<v Speaker 1>condit and guys like that always hinton </v>

767
00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.760
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a high altitude and I know Diego Sanchez</v>

768
00:33:00.761 --> 00:33:05.060
<v Speaker 1>is all being in the altitude so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think I think everybody does their</v>

769
00:33:05.061 --> 00:33:07.250
<v Speaker 1>own thing or at least there is some type</v>
<v Speaker 1>of structure where they do,</v>

770
00:33:07.251 --> 00:33:09.920
<v Speaker 1>do Sam Dume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of the big teams at least.</v>

771
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

772
00:33:11.151 --> 00:33:12.330
<v Speaker 1>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

773
00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:15.530
<v Speaker 1>there's a big benefit to a team isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>there when you're a,</v>

774
00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:20.560
<v Speaker 1>you're a fighter being is the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the most intimate individual thing </v>

775
00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:20.560
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

776
00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.910
<v Speaker 1>It's the most lonely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>separated,</v>

777
00:33:22.911 --> 00:33:24.340
<v Speaker 1>selfish completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

778
00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:29.450
<v Speaker 1>Fish completely on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a massive benefit obviously </v>

779
00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:30.490
<v Speaker 1>to being a part of a team because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see like,</v>

780
00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:34.290
<v Speaker 1>like at this point in time there seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be like a separation.</v>

781
00:33:34.291 --> 00:33:38.330
<v Speaker 1>There's very few high level fighters </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are training like individually that</v>

782
00:33:38.331 --> 00:33:43.331
<v Speaker 1>you don't know who they're training if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't hear about them training with </v>

783
00:33:43.331 --> 00:33:43.331
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

784
00:33:43.331 --> 00:33:43.331
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very few.</v>

785
00:33:43.331 --> 00:33:47.890
<v Speaker 1>It's usually guys that are just sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>just getting into the game and then the </v>

786
00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:47.890
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when Jon Jones,</v>

787
00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:52.480
<v Speaker 1>before he joined Jackson's camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was up in upstate New York and you </v>

788
00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:56.501
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have guys like his level around </v>

789
00:33:56.501 --> 00:33:58.100
<v Speaker 1>there and went over to Jackson's and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then really started to catch a stride.</v>

790
00:33:58.130 --> 00:33:59.660
<v Speaker 1>He was searching for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A coach.</v>

791
00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.840
<v Speaker 1>Everyone package.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

792
00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:07.090
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of the fighters need that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I do with a lot of my time </v>

793
00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:09.740
<v Speaker 1>and money was spent searching for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>coach and just a good camp.</v>

794
00:34:09.741 --> 00:34:14.741
<v Speaker 1>Somebody that just fit me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took me a while to settle in and </v>

795
00:34:14.741 --> 00:34:14.741
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

796
00:34:14.741 --> 00:34:15.080
<v Speaker 1>I think I found that at alliance and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>may be other stuff.</v>

797
00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:17.590
<v Speaker 1>Gang had good camps in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>

798
00:34:17.591 --> 00:34:21.410
<v Speaker 1>they're there at one point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just like att and you know,</v>

799
00:34:21.411 --> 00:34:23.210
<v Speaker 1>there's still good and there's getting a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people.</v>

800
00:34:23.211 --> 00:34:26.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrone Woodley over the over the week.</v>

801
00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:27.490
<v Speaker 2>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gotcha.</v>

802
00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:29.440
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what I think.</v>

803
00:34:29.441 --> 00:34:31.780
<v Speaker 2>Here's what I think a tyrone woodley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tyrone says,</v>

804
00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:36.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm watching a GSP and I'm watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>Johnny Hendricks.</v>

805
00:34:36.311 --> 00:34:38.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm watching them and I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm really thinking,</v>

806
00:34:38.711 --> 00:34:40.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a bad thing to say,</v>

807
00:34:40.450 --> 00:34:43.510
<v Speaker 2>but I'm thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who cares who wins here?</v>

808
00:34:43.511 --> 00:34:46.120
<v Speaker 2>Because Tyrone Woodley is going to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>and fuck these dudes.</v>

809
00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:47.380
<v Speaker 2>Both these dudes up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

810
00:34:47.381 --> 00:34:49.030
<v Speaker 2>Tyron Woodley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just lots of jake shields.</v>

811
00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:52.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but man that he got knocked out by named</v>

812
00:34:52.141 --> 00:34:53.210
<v Speaker 2>mark too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

813
00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:55.360
<v Speaker 2>I think tyron woodley is a bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker.</v>

814
00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.930
<v Speaker 2>He's an amazing athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but tyron Woodley,</v>

815
00:34:58.960 --> 00:34:59.830
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

816
00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:02.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he really has to be cost check,</v>

817
00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:07.500
<v Speaker 2>but he really has to face like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>really high level guys like Carlos </v>

818
00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:11.580
<v Speaker 2>Condit and we'll see if he's capable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's an amazing athlete and if </v>

819
00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:15.091
<v Speaker 2>he's not capable of beating those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that caliber guy now or he wasn't maybe </v>

820
00:35:15.091 --> 00:35:16.840
<v Speaker 2>a year ago when he fought mark warrant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna keep getting better.</v>

821
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:21.460
<v Speaker 2>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only reason I say that is just based</v>

822
00:35:21.461 --> 00:35:23.920
<v Speaker 2>on that cost check,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just based on that,</v>

823
00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:26.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had all the potential high,</v>

824
00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:30.550
<v Speaker 2>high level wrestler and he had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has a good striking,</v>

825
00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:34.300
<v Speaker 2>but in that cost check fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw different human being ice.</v>

826
00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:36.730
<v Speaker 2>I'd never seen anybody throw punches </v>
<v Speaker 2>that fast.</v>

827
00:35:36.731 --> 00:35:38.610
<v Speaker 2>And MMA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the fastest,</v>

828
00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:40.580
<v Speaker 5>most powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see those right hands.</v>

829
00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:42.390
<v Speaker 5>He would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was like several of them.</v>

830
00:35:42.391 --> 00:35:43.020
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

831
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:48.230
<v Speaker 5>I just missed it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just that you just saw a display </v>

832
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:51.290
<v Speaker 5>of immense power.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I don't see anybody throwing </v>

833
00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:52.420
<v Speaker 5>punches like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What a system with heat,</v>

834
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:54.260
<v Speaker 5>how cost check.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know what I mean?</v>

835
00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:57.060
<v Speaker 5>It seems like he finally is putting it </v>
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>

836
00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:58.560
<v Speaker 5>I never did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you notice that?</v>

837
00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:00.720
<v Speaker 5>Holy Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was fast.</v>

838
00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:02.790
<v Speaker 5>Three different times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just want to caution,</v>

839
00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:04.440
<v Speaker 3>same dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he came out,</v>

840
00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:06.510
<v Speaker 3>he was wrestling people and everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

841
00:36:06.511 --> 00:36:07.630
<v Speaker 3>ah man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy knows.</v>

842
00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:08.940
<v Speaker 3>He does his wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Next thing you know,</v>

843
00:36:08.941 --> 00:36:11.280
<v Speaker 3>he was knocking dudes out with the right</v>
<v Speaker 3>hand because it's starting to feel a lot</v>

844
00:36:11.281 --> 00:36:12.410
<v Speaker 3>more confident,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

845
00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.400
<v Speaker 3>probably after the show he got into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>good camp,</v>

846
00:36:14.401 --> 00:36:15.580
<v Speaker 3>which now like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>

847
00:36:15.581 --> 00:36:16.770
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have standup skills.</v>

848
00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:18.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm already an athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I can rustle.</v>

849
00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:24.110
<v Speaker 3>Next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he started to believe in his hands </v>

850
00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:24.600
<v Speaker 3>morning that I'd probably credit that to</v>
<v Speaker 3>like him being done at American top team</v>

851
00:36:24.601 --> 00:36:27.690
<v Speaker 3>starting to train and to use his </v>
<v Speaker 3>athleticism because the dude's obviously</v>

852
00:36:27.691 --> 00:36:28.320
<v Speaker 3>a freak of nature.</v>

853
00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:30.380
<v Speaker 5>I think you see Woodley's fight with Jay</v>
<v Speaker 5>heroin.</v>

854
00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.650
<v Speaker 5>I probably did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I like 90 percent of those fights.</v>

855
00:36:33.651 --> 00:36:34.460
<v Speaker 5>I forget them.</v>

856
00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.570
<v Speaker 1>Who was the first round knockout?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was incredible.</v>

857
00:36:36.571 --> 00:36:38.340
<v Speaker 1>It was just swarmed them.</v>

858
00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.310
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't it seem like the way he threw </v>
<v Speaker 5>that right hand,</v>

859
00:36:40.311 --> 00:36:42.410
<v Speaker 5>like no one will survive that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If he cannot.</v>

860
00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:45.950
<v Speaker 5>He's got that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's for sure.</v>

861
00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:47.390
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's got the wrestling.</v>

862
00:36:47.391 --> 00:36:52.391
<v Speaker 5>I think you know what happens with even </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Brazilian fighters to his high level</v>

863
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:58.270
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 5>black belt still come in and they </v>

864
00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:01.421
<v Speaker 5>definitely are not where they need to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>with our striking and some of them like </v>

865
00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:05.810
<v Speaker 5>super high level guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they come in and try on the May and they</v>

866
00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:10.830
<v Speaker 5>just haven't spent enough time with our </v>
<v Speaker 5>striking and they'll just leave mma and </v>

867
00:37:11.061 --> 00:37:16.061
<v Speaker 5>just go back to Jujitsu because they </v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't get the striking was just too </v>

868
00:37:16.061 --> 00:37:16.061
<v Speaker 5>hard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then there's some guys that stick it</v>

869
00:37:16.061 --> 00:37:18.860
<v Speaker 5>out and they go through rough patches </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they lose because of their striking.</v>

870
00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:23.090
<v Speaker 5>People will criticize them because of </v>
<v Speaker 5>their striking like Vodoun for instance,</v>

871
00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:26.600
<v Speaker 5>and then after a while they just stick </v>
<v Speaker 5>it out and my Damien Maia,</v>

872
00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:28.790
<v Speaker 5>they just stick it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People talking shit on their striking,</v>

873
00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:33.960
<v Speaker 5>but they stick it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They handle some losses and as long as </v>

874
00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:38.291
<v Speaker 5>they just keep going and keep the </v>
<v Speaker 5>consistency of all of a sudden the </v>

875
00:37:38.291 --> 00:37:42.040
<v Speaker 5>silver dome is a dangerous striker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now all of a sudden Damien Maia has a </v>

876
00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:42.360
<v Speaker 5>real legit stripe.</v>

877
00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:44.670
<v Speaker 3>Could you find out what type of man you </v>
<v Speaker 3>are when you're.</v>

878
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.690
<v Speaker 3>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

879
00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:46.820
<v Speaker 3>when you're winning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're on top,</v>

880
00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.840
<v Speaker 3>everybody thinks you're all good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then when you lose you're like,</v>

881
00:37:48.841 --> 00:37:53.841
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I really got to work on some </v>

882
00:37:53.841 --> 00:37:56.211
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you find out what type of man this </v>

883
00:37:56.211 --> 00:37:56.211
<v Speaker 3>guy is going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is he going to go back out there?</v>

884
00:37:56.211 --> 00:37:56.670
<v Speaker 3>Is you're going to work on things and </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting better?</v>

885
00:37:56.671 --> 00:37:59.310
<v Speaker 3>Is he just going to go out there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fold over and then that was it.</v>

886
00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:01.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For some fighters it is a big confidence</v>

887
00:38:01.831 --> 00:38:06.831
<v Speaker 1>hit that they never recover from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have this idea that there are </v>

888
00:38:06.831 --> 00:38:07.440
<v Speaker 1>unbeatable from the jump and then once </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone beats them,</v>

889
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:11.310
<v Speaker 1>they have to sort of rethink their whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>paradigm and some guys don't ever do it.</v>

890
00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.430
<v Speaker 1>Some guys come back stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

891
00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:16.470
<v Speaker 1>some guys come back from a loss and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are different guy there.</v>

892
00:38:16.471 --> 00:38:18.120
<v Speaker 1>They're more focused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more intense,</v>

893
00:38:18.121 --> 00:38:23.121
<v Speaker 1>more aware.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They cut out all the bullshit in their </v>

894
00:38:23.121 --> 00:38:23.121
<v Speaker 1>camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They thought back on all the things that</v>

895
00:38:23.121 --> 00:38:23.121
<v Speaker 1>they did that might've crossed</v>

896
00:38:23.121 --> 00:38:23.620
<v Speaker 3>it's wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

897
00:38:23.621 --> 00:38:25.540
<v Speaker 3>It's just like growing and getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>older,</v>

898
00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.430
<v Speaker 3>making changes just even outside of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting,</v>

899
00:38:27.431 --> 00:38:32.431
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting doesn't define half these guys </v>

900
00:38:32.431 --> 00:38:32.431
<v Speaker 3>that are in the octagon because a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>them are real cool dudes.</v>

901
00:38:32.431 --> 00:38:36.721
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody I've ever met has been been </v>

902
00:38:36.721 --> 00:38:36.721
<v Speaker 3>like super down to earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>

903
00:38:36.721 --> 00:38:37.390
<v Speaker 3>You meet a lot of cool guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it does.</v>

904
00:38:37.391 --> 00:38:38.560
<v Speaker 3>It does play a difference,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

905
00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:40.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt man.</v>

906
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:43.800
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that you just cut down from</v>

907
00:38:43.801 --> 00:38:47.940
<v Speaker 2>155 to 145 pounds and that's like one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big issues in mma,</v>

908
00:38:47.941 --> 00:38:51.460
<v Speaker 2>the people keep talking about is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of weight guys cut in.</v>

909
00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:52.650
<v Speaker 2>How they cut it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

910
00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:54.030
<v Speaker 2>guy like Tyron Woodley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

911
00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:57.230
<v Speaker 2>what does he weigh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is he won?</v>

912
00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:57.970
<v Speaker 2>Seventy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

913
00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:01.350
<v Speaker 2>That makes zero sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm not racist,</v>

914
00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:03.300
<v Speaker 2>but you ever noticed like black guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

915
00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:04.280
<v Speaker 2>really huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

916
00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:09.640
<v Speaker 2>I love when people say that and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>they talk about black people are racist </v>

917
00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.970
<v Speaker 2>and having a perfect body and having the</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect body.</v>

918
00:39:11.971 --> 00:39:13.560
<v Speaker 2>How's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is liking watermelon?</v>

919
00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:16.020
<v Speaker 2>Bad watermelons fucking delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

920
00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:18.070
<v Speaker 2>And well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll jump on this</v>

921
00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:19.210
<v Speaker 3>scale and then they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

922
00:39:19.211 --> 00:39:21.280
<v Speaker 3>they're not as heavy or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like their body's not as dense.</v>

923
00:39:21.281 --> 00:39:26.281
<v Speaker 3>I remember this friend of mine back home</v>
<v Speaker 3>demicco and he was just this big dude </v>

924
00:39:26.281 --> 00:39:30.571
<v Speaker 3>and we used to work together at the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>company and he would just eat whatever </v>

925
00:39:30.571 --> 00:39:30.571
<v Speaker 3>chips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hot dogs,</v>

926
00:39:30.571 --> 00:39:32.110
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was just always jack man,</v>

927
00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.390
<v Speaker 2>whenever I understood it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

928
00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:35.520
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm over here getting like a belly.</v>

929
00:39:35.521 --> 00:39:36.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

930
00:39:36.241 --> 00:39:37.410
<v Speaker 2>no way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that.</v>

931
00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:40.170
<v Speaker 2>It's just having a mesomorphic frame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

932
00:39:40.171 --> 00:39:42.840
<v Speaker 2>And that's what Tyron Woodley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like extreme Mesomorph,</v>

933
00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:45.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you cut down to 1:45,</v>

934
00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:47.790
<v Speaker 2>how much did you have to lose?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

935
00:39:47.791 --> 00:39:51.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably one 76.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] 77 right now.</v>

936
00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:52.310
<v Speaker 2>My God,</v>

937
00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:57.380
<v Speaker 3>I cut a lot of weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I credit that to the fitness vet </v>

938
00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:57.470
<v Speaker 3>diet that I'm on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And George Lockhart,</v>

939
00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:02.800
<v Speaker 3>who just knows how to weight cut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was thinking about it for a long </v>

940
00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:03.290
<v Speaker 3>time and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the change is going down there.</v>

941
00:40:03.291 --> 00:40:05.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm a lot faster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel a lot more athletic.</v>

942
00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:07.610
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm working on my athleticism,</v>

943
00:40:07.611 --> 00:40:10.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to be a lot more precise and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

944
00:40:10.191 --> 00:40:12.380
<v Speaker 3>I know that the power is always there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot more natural,</v>

945
00:40:12.381 --> 00:40:15.260
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like I have just a better </v>
<v Speaker 3>mental edge.</v>

946
00:40:15.261 --> 00:40:20.261
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can use a lot more of tools at 145 </v>

947
00:40:20.261 --> 00:40:20.840
<v Speaker 3>pounds and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I basically grew up inside the octagon.</v>

948
00:40:20.841 --> 00:40:22.520
<v Speaker 3>I probably shouldn't have been there at </v>
<v Speaker 3>a certain time.</v>

949
00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:27.850
<v Speaker 3>It's just that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my heart carried me through like a lot </v>

950
00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:27.850
<v Speaker 3>of fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like I said,</v>

951
00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:29.630
<v Speaker 3>I was searching for this camp to help me</v>
<v Speaker 3>to help me and be like,</v>

952
00:40:29.631 --> 00:40:30.290
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's get a hold of me.</v>

953
00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:31.250
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have talent,</v>

954
00:40:31.251 --> 00:40:36.251
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just wanted to get out of my hometown </v>

955
00:40:36.251 --> 00:40:36.251
<v Speaker 3>after a certain why I can only,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was,</v>

956
00:40:36.251 --> 00:40:38.010
<v Speaker 3>which was des Moines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iowa and uh,</v>

957
00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:38.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just like,</v>

958
00:40:38.691 --> 00:40:40.430
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to get ahold of some better guys.</v>

959
00:40:40.431 --> 00:40:43.250
<v Speaker 3>I gotta I gotTa train,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get a higher level coaching,</v>

960
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.950
<v Speaker 3>just different type of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

961
00:40:44.951 --> 00:40:46.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean I didn't even have a striking </v>
<v Speaker 3>coach.</v>

962
00:40:46.161 --> 00:40:48.860
<v Speaker 3>I was just going to gym to gym,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whichever was the best I was there.</v>

963
00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:51.800
<v Speaker 3>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it just credited that to like we</v>

964
00:40:51.801 --> 00:40:56.801
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't mind my coaches and then you </v>

965
00:40:56.801 --> 00:40:56.801
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making that cut.</v>

966
00:40:56.801 --> 00:40:58.640
<v Speaker 3>I need the George Lockhart and fitness </v>
<v Speaker 3>vet because he gives me everything.</v>

967
00:40:58.641 --> 00:41:00.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm water load and a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

968
00:41:00.171 --> 00:41:01.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to give away too much of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this stuff,</v>

969
00:41:01.491 --> 00:41:03.860
<v Speaker 3>but I feel oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel amazing.</v>

970
00:41:03.861 --> 00:41:05.870
<v Speaker 3>And it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the reload after the weight cut,</v>

971
00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:11.130
<v Speaker 3>this stuff and the things that he has me</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat specific's and everything that I'm </v>

972
00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:11.240
<v Speaker 3>calculating it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

973
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:14.260
<v Speaker 2>Phil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you get down to 1:45,</v>

974
00:41:14.261 --> 00:41:15.970
<v Speaker 2>what are you wearing when you walk into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the octagon?</v>

975
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.330
<v Speaker 2>About one slash 70.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

976
00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:21.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you using</v>

977
00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:23.150
<v Speaker 3>eating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eating light?</v>

978
00:41:23.151 --> 00:41:23.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

979
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:25.280
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many ivy bags do you put?</v>

980
00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:30.300
<v Speaker 3>I do too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do a one water regular water and then </v>

981
00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:30.470
<v Speaker 3>I do like a warm temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a sodium bag</v>

982
00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:36.010
<v Speaker 2>just to obtain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to like if you didn't have </v>

983
00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:36.010
<v Speaker 2>those bags it would make</v>

984
00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:36.010
<v Speaker 4>a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

985
00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:36.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hell yeah,</v>

986
00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:37.640
<v Speaker 4>you can definitely tell people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't like,</v>

987
00:41:37.641 --> 00:41:41.030
<v Speaker 4>you know that they don't want to do the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bags and I keep telling them at the high</v>

988
00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:42.170
<v Speaker 4>level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

989
00:41:42.171 --> 00:41:45.890
<v Speaker 4>you want to rehydrate scientifically and</v>

990
00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:52.090
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a guy in the UFC that got </v>

991
00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:52.730
<v Speaker 1>caught way back in the day because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was taking blood out of his body to make</v>

992
00:41:52.731 --> 00:41:55.700
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They went to his hotel room.</v>

993
00:41:55.701 --> 00:41:58.940
<v Speaker 1>There was a doctor there and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>bags of his blood.</v>

994
00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:01.310
<v Speaker 1>They took it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they did.</v>

995
00:42:01.311 --> 00:42:06.311
<v Speaker 1>They stored it somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess they had a freezer or a </v>

996
00:42:06.311 --> 00:42:06.311
<v Speaker 1>refrigerator there or something and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it back in.</v>

997
00:42:06.311 --> 00:42:08.510
<v Speaker 1>His body looks like blood doping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like blood doping.</v>

998
00:42:08.511 --> 00:42:13.511
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean they're not giving them </v>

999
00:42:13.511 --> 00:42:13.550
<v Speaker 1>enough chance to rebuild the blood </v>
<v Speaker 1>cells.</v>

1000
00:42:13.551 --> 00:42:18.551
<v Speaker 1>The blood being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way it works is your body rebuilds </v>

1001
00:42:18.551 --> 00:42:19.400
<v Speaker 1>all those blood cells and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>reintroduce all this extra blood.</v>

1002
00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:24.550
<v Speaker 1>You've got crazy amounts of blood now </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your body is eventually going to </v>

1003
00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:24.550
<v Speaker 1>burn it off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but until then,</v>

1004
00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:29.020
<v Speaker 1>enjoy the benefits of extreme production</v>
<v Speaker 1>of oxygen or utilization of oxygen.</v>

1005
00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:33.560
<v Speaker 1>That's what that epo stuff does to what </v>
<v Speaker 1>those cyclists keep getting busted for,</v>

1006
00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:36.960
<v Speaker 1>that he was going too hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too hard out there.</v>

1007
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:42.190
<v Speaker 1>So this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he cut the weight and then the last </v>

1008
00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:42.400
<v Speaker 1>couple of pounds he took out and blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

1009
00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.420
<v Speaker 1>And then he put it right back in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he went back,</v>

1010
00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:45.200
<v Speaker 4>I'd probably,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1011
00:42:45.201 --> 00:42:47.120
<v Speaker 4>some people will pass on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you already cutting down,</v>

1012
00:42:47.121 --> 00:42:48.470
<v Speaker 4>wait and then go to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1013
00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:50.210
<v Speaker 4>I guess depending on how much weight he </v>
<v Speaker 4>cut,</v>

1014
00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:52.340
<v Speaker 1>I've seen dudes that look like they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>on death's door.</v>

1015
00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:57.580
<v Speaker 1>I've seen dudes that are cutting weight </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Travis Luder when he fought </v>

1016
00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:00.521
<v Speaker 1>Anderson Silva.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen a guy look worse in my </v>

1017
00:43:00.521 --> 00:43:01.280
<v Speaker 1>life that's still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was shuffling.</v>

1018
00:43:01.281 --> 00:43:04.250
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't walk band.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was shuffling towards the scale.</v>

1019
00:43:04.251 --> 00:43:08.060
<v Speaker 1>The second time he was making weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his lips were chapped as fuck.</v>

1020
00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:11.510
<v Speaker 1>His whole face was sucked in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looked like he was dying.</v>

1021
00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:15.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was essentially draining himself out.</v>

1022
00:43:15.141 --> 00:43:17.570
<v Speaker 1>But he just miscalculated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get down.</v>

1023
00:43:17.571 --> 00:43:19.610
<v Speaker 1>He was this close to beating Anderson </v>
<v Speaker 1>Silva.</v>

1024
00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:24.170
<v Speaker 1>He was all over at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guys who are like super talented,</v>

1025
00:43:24.171 --> 00:43:29.171
<v Speaker 1>it didn't live up to their potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Travis Luder might be number one in my </v>

1026
00:43:29.171 --> 00:43:29.171
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's one of those guys.</v>

1027
00:43:29.171 --> 00:43:30.080
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about the training </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself,</v>

1028
00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:31.610
<v Speaker 1>trained himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't like.</v>

1029
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:37.030
<v Speaker 1>He didn't like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was from Texas and he went to </v>

1030
00:43:37.371 --> 00:43:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Jackson's towards the last few fights of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his career.</v>

1031
00:43:40.011 --> 00:43:45.011
<v Speaker 1>I think he was at Jackson's when he lost</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the tall and I think that might've </v>

1032
00:43:45.011 --> 00:43:47.711
<v Speaker 1>been the last fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got some back issues though too </v>

<v Speaker 1>jacked up.</v>

1039
00:43:59.751 --> 00:44:00.220
<v Speaker 1>Their backs</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you've seen.</v>

1043
00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:14.680
<v Speaker 4>If people were watching,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you'll start getting rounded like </v>

1044
00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:14.680

1045
00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:16.430
<v Speaker 4>but if you get into Lacrosse ball and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're able to break up your Pec minor,</v>

1049
00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:24.340
<v Speaker 4>your elbow is not going to hurt anymore </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're,</v>

1050
00:44:24.341 --> 00:44:29.341
<v Speaker 4>you're elongating the muscles that need </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be in long gated if you're talking </v>

<v Speaker 6>My,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>

1073
00:45:17.871 --> 00:45:18.980
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of my uncles,</v>

1074
00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:24.040
<v Speaker 6>it was my grandfather.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was really big into like wrestling </v>

1075
00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:24.200
<v Speaker 6>and boxing and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So he,</v>

1076
00:45:24.201 --> 00:45:24.760
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1077
00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:26.390
<v Speaker 6>when my parents were kind of going </v>
<v Speaker 6>through a hard time,</v>

1078
00:45:26.391 --> 00:45:28.100
<v Speaker 6>he's the one who encouraged me to get </v>
<v Speaker 6>into wrestling,</v>

1079
00:45:28.101 --> 00:45:31.370
<v Speaker 6>get involved in sports like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I started wrestling as a kid.</v>

1080
00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:34.580
<v Speaker 6>How old?</v>
<v Speaker 6>About five years old until.</v>

1081
00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:37.340
<v Speaker 6>Did you wrestle in high school?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I did wrestle in high school.</v>

1082
00:45:37.341 --> 00:45:42.341
<v Speaker 6>I wrestled a one year in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My parents had a complication so I was </v>

1083
00:45:42.341 --> 00:45:47.081
<v Speaker 6>Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was transferring to like a lot of </v>

1084
00:45:47.081 --> 00:45:48.881
<v Speaker 6>schools so I was kind of wrestling but </v>
<v Speaker 6>like I was on like another side of town </v>

1085
00:45:48.881 --> 00:45:48.881
<v Speaker 6>that one week I was on another side of </v>
<v Speaker 6>town.</v>

1086
00:45:48.881 --> 00:45:51.500
<v Speaker 6>There's a recipe for becoming a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a bunch of schools.</v>

1087
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.000
<v Speaker 6>So when I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when I wrestled I wasn't like great or </v>

1088
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:57.000

<v Speaker 6>background.</v>

<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1120
00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:53.300
<v Speaker 6>the hardest thing is when you're sore </v>
<v Speaker 6>like you're talking about,</v>

1121
00:46:53.301 --> 00:46:53.840
<v Speaker 6>you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 6>who you want to be in the future.</v>

1126
00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:05.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>George St Pierre was talking about after</v>

1127
00:47:05.671 --> 00:47:06.250
<v Speaker 2>the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

1128
00:47:06.251 --> 00:47:11.251
<v Speaker 2>it was an interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to hear nothing about </v>

1129
00:47:11.251 --> 00:47:11.251
<v Speaker 2>George St Pierre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This podcast.</v>

1130
00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:14.070
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if we just made.</v>

1131
00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:17.640
<v Speaker 2>We should have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should have trolled everyone else.</v>

1132
00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:18.500
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right,</v>

1133
00:47:18.501 --> 00:47:20.940
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right about that fight funnel.</v>

1134
00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:22.810
<v Speaker 2>Even that important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want it.</v>

1135
00:47:22.811 --> 00:47:25.260
<v Speaker 2>That's the last thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was talking about I can't sleep.</v>

1136
00:47:25.261 --> 00:47:27.090
<v Speaker 2>He's got a few personal issues </v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently,</v>

1137
00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 2>allegedly that's being reported and</v>

1138
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:34.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately with his family's health </v>

1139
00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:34.980
<v Speaker 1>and what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's true,</v>

1140
00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:35.830
<v Speaker 1>what's not true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what this story is,</v>

1141
00:47:36.010 --> 00:47:38.440
<v Speaker 1>which makes a ton of sense why he saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he can't sleep,</v>

1142
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:40.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's having a real hard time.</v>

1143
00:47:40.001 --> 00:47:43.810
<v Speaker 1>He thinks he's going crazy and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about on the podcast,</v>

1144
00:47:43.811 --> 00:47:48.811
<v Speaker 1>he said he gets abducted by aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think also it's just fucking hard </v>

1145
00:47:48.811 --> 00:47:50.080
<v Speaker 1>to keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what you're saying about the day</v>

1146
00:47:50.081 --> 00:47:50.890
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>day out,</v>

1147

00:48:19.381 --> 00:48:21.070
<v Speaker 3>all those hormones that you need to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like boost yourself up,</v>

1162
00:48:21.071 --> 00:48:23.590
<v Speaker 3>get yourself back into that mode.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your body is used to be like,</v>

1163
00:48:23.591 --> 00:48:24.940
<v Speaker 3>no bro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're already tapped out.</v>

1164
00:48:24.941 --> 00:48:27.080
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've been filling out.</v>

1165
00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:30.460
<v Speaker 3>So then like you're just like boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just hit like a crash as compared to</v>

1166
00:48:30.461 --> 00:48:32.650
<v Speaker 3>if you're relaxed all week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're chilling out,</v>

1167
00:48:32.651 --> 00:48:34.750
<v Speaker 3>you're not really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just thinking the good vibes,</v>

1168
00:48:34.751 --> 00:48:39.751
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weight's going down and things are just </v>

1169
00:48:39.751 --> 00:48:39.751
<v Speaker 3>going beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything's looking sharp,</v>

1170
00:48:39.751 --> 00:48:39.751
<v Speaker 3>but just keeping yourself relaxed the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole time.</v>

1171
00:48:39.751 --> 00:48:42.670
<v Speaker 3>So then when you go to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're energized to the Max.</v>

1172
00:48:42.671 --> 00:48:43.330

<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mostly knockouts mostly.</v>

1230
00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:55.140
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Comes from not vicious knockouts.</v>

1231
00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:57.640
<v Speaker 3>Did you have a highlight reel of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>vicious striking,</v>

1232
00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:03.060
<v Speaker 3>like how to Joe Silva?</v>
<v Speaker 3>My highlight reel is so old because </v>

1233
00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:03.760
<v Speaker 3>anytime I put something for the UFC up </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Not A,</v>

1236
00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:11.840
<v Speaker 3>not a lot of people.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1239
00:51:13.411 --> 00:51:14.020

<v Speaker 3>And then he got all the UFC tapes.</v>

1242
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:19.960
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about that?</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about right there when they </v>

1249
00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:40.520
<v Speaker 2>sense for Osha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I liked that.</v>

1250
00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:42.800
<v Speaker 2>I liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked seeing violence.</v>

1251
00:51:42.801 --> 00:51:44.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'm a big uh,</v>

1252
00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:47.090
<v Speaker 2>for violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like watching it.</v>

1253
00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:49.400
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a fan of concussions.</v>

1254
00:51:49.450 --> 00:51:54.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when we're talking about the </v>

1255
00:51:54.450 --> 00:51:54.570
<v Speaker 2>monorepo thing where he held on to tap </v>
<v Speaker 2>too late or too,</v>

1256
00:51:54.610 --> 00:51:55.340
<v Speaker 2>too long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1257
00:51:55.341 --> 00:51:56.450
<v Speaker 2>I think he got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to,</v>

1258
00:51:56.451 --> 00:51:58.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get bit controversial on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1259
00:51:58.431 --> 00:52:03.431
<v Speaker 2>I think he got a bum deal on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think what he held onto was </v>

1260
00:52:03.431 --> 00:52:07.100
<v Speaker 2>barely a second and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucked up to do and he does it,</v>

1261
00:52:07.101 --> 00:52:12.101
<v Speaker 2>but he did it way worse in the past and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's at least a little bit </v>

1262
00:52:12.101 --> 00:52:16.241
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's real hard to get that guy </v>

1263
00:52:16.241 --> 00:52:16.241
<v Speaker 2>to let go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when he's trying to tap you,</v>

1264
00:52:16.241 --> 00:52:19.820
<v Speaker 2>it's some life and death shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He grew up on a farm he liked,</v>

1265
00:52:19.821 --> 00:52:22.880
<v Speaker 2>had no schooling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was eating pig slop when he was 13.</v>

1266
00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:28.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're not dealing with a </v>

1267
00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:28.060
<v Speaker 2>regular dude here.</v>

1268
00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:28.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>

1269
00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:28.060
<v Speaker 3>that's a very aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1270
00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:30.610
<v Speaker 3>behavior to be living like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd never heard that about him,</v>

1271
00:52:30.611 --> 00:52:33.740
<v Speaker 3>but I imagine that's a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 3>of an aggressive behavior than anything</v>

1272
00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:35.350
<v Speaker 2>but in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

1273
00:52:35.351 --> 00:52:37.030
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very tough environment,</v>

1274
00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:42.300
<v Speaker 2>but much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much harder than I think most of us can </v>

1275
00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:42.300
<v Speaker 2>comprehend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

1276
00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:44.230
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just blows me away,</v>

1277
00:52:44.231 --> 00:52:45.030
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

1278
00:52:45.031 --> 00:52:50.031
<v Speaker 2>In pig slop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has a giant scar on his chest from </v>

1279
00:52:50.031 --> 00:52:52.321
<v Speaker 2>when they couldn't get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had cut open and they couldn't get a </v>

1280
00:52:52.321 --> 00:52:54.811
<v Speaker 2>medical attention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they use like crazy glue on it and </v>

1281
00:52:54.811 --> 00:52:54.811
<v Speaker 2>try to pinch it together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a giant scar on his chest.</v>

1282
00:52:54.811 --> 00:52:59.280
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he got a raw deal because I </v>

1283
00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:00.400
<v Speaker 2>think that there's something wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 2>what he did.</v>

1284
00:53:00.670 --> 00:53:05.670
<v Speaker 2>Then there's something wrong with what </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan Henderson did to Brisbane or what </v>

1285
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:06.190
<v Speaker 2>you just did right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that show.</v>

1286
00:53:06.191 --> 00:53:06.440
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1287
00:53:06.450 --> 00:53:11.450
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get called off and that guy </v>

1288
00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:11.450
<v Speaker 2>could have jumped up.</v>

1289
00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:11.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1290
00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:13.240
<v Speaker 3>it was bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>

1291
00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:15.430
<v Speaker 3>I happen to land the kick and then I </v>
<v Speaker 3>came right back,</v>

1292
00:53:15.490 --> 00:53:18.550
<v Speaker 3>right back to my base.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of saw him go to get up,</v>

1293
00:53:18.551 --> 00:53:23.551
<v Speaker 3>which I thought maybe he was Tko because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew it was a good shot and I didn't </v>

1294
00:53:23.551 --> 00:53:27.451
<v Speaker 3>expect it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I expected it to land in land heart at </v>

1295
00:53:27.451 --> 00:53:27.840
<v Speaker 3>least scaring boat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He leaned into that and it was basically</v>

1296
00:53:27.841 --> 00:53:28.860
<v Speaker 3>all faints.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then when I,</v>

1297
00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:33.980
<v Speaker 3>I kicked it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I landed back on my bass and he kinda </v>

1298
00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:33.980
<v Speaker 3>like went to like get up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like almost.</v>

1299
00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:38.270
<v Speaker 3>It almost looked like he went to get up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I missed a short split second that you </v>

1300
00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:38.270
<v Speaker 3>have to decide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1301
00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:40.020
<v Speaker 3>But like I'm a lion bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a family to feed,</v>

1302
00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:45.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you said something about a guy like </v>

1303
00:53:46.751 --> 00:53:51.751
<v Speaker 2>Diego Sanchez.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I think about when anybody </v>

1304
00:53:51.751 --> 00:53:51.751
<v Speaker 2>wants to stop a fight too soon.</v>

1305
00:53:51.751 --> 00:53:52.160
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of garlic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Diego Sanchez,</v>

1306
00:53:52.450 --> 00:53:53.670
<v Speaker 3>Diego Sanchez,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can hit that dude.</v>

1307
00:53:54.310 --> 00:53:59.310
<v Speaker 3>He wants to go out on the sheet and hit </v>
<v Speaker 3>him with a media and he comes running </v>

1308
00:53:59.310 --> 00:54:01.931
<v Speaker 3>back at you even more power fights his </v>
<v Speaker 3>mouthpiece and starts fucking bought </v>

1309
00:54:01.931 --> 00:54:03.530
<v Speaker 3>those stories and you cracked him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1310
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:06.530
<v Speaker 3>I think that Shin might've knocked out </v>
<v Speaker 3>any human being on earth,</v>

1311
00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:08.850
<v Speaker 3>but it is possible that it got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1312
00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:12.700
<v Speaker 3>Diego's been hit with some bombs goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>down and somehow under the recoveries.</v>

1313
00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:13.860
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've cracked them before.</v>

1314
00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:16.460
<v Speaker 3>And you do the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've just done this in his backyard,</v>

1315
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:21.470
<v Speaker 3>does it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do a video of it and we just start </v>

1316
00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:21.470
<v Speaker 3>throwing down and that's the type of </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

1317
00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:22.700
<v Speaker 3>Diego isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does bring that out in you,</v>

1318
00:54:22.701 --> 00:54:27.701
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had the funniest times training </v>

1319
00:54:27.701 --> 00:54:27.701
<v Speaker 3>with Diego Sanchez.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I owe him a lot,</v>

1320
00:54:27.701 --> 00:54:27.701
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

1321
00:54:27.701 --> 00:54:28.700
<v Speaker 3>for me being here and getting to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>next level,</v>

1322
00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:33.710
<v Speaker 3>hit him and Josh near like one of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>inspirational dudes and I'm hanging out </v>

1323
00:54:33.710 --> 00:54:37.031
<v Speaker 3>with these guys when I'm young and when </v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a chance to invite me out and </v>

1324
00:54:37.031 --> 00:54:37.031
<v Speaker 3>train with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>

1325
00:54:37.031 --> 00:54:38.180
<v Speaker 3>I had the funniest time train with Diego</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sanchez.</v>

1326
00:54:38.181 --> 00:54:39.070
<v Speaker 3>He's a wild man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's okay.</v>

1327
00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:40.470
<v Speaker 2>A wild man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the most,</v>

1328
00:54:40.471 --> 00:54:45.471
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most consistently entertained on </v>

1329
00:54:45.471 --> 00:54:45.471
<v Speaker 2>fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe ever.</v>

1330
00:54:45.471 --> 00:54:46.680
<v Speaker 2>I got a question for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who would you rather be?</v>

1331
00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:50.190
<v Speaker 2>Would you rather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you rather be Mike Pierce?</v>

1332
00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:52.890
<v Speaker 2>Would you rather be Mike Pierce?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1333
00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:55.830
<v Speaker 2>Or go through it and Mike Pierce went </v>
<v Speaker 2>through with it.</v>

1334
00:54:55.840 --> 00:55:00.840
<v Speaker 2>Who's smart boss?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to live through it or lifted </v>

1335
00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:01.790
<v Speaker 2>with a honey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1336
00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:03.330
<v Speaker 2>Jason went through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1337
00:55:03.331 --> 00:55:05.790
<v Speaker 2>the thing Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike Pierce can heal his knee up.</v>

1338
00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:09.030
<v Speaker 2>He totally replaced nothing towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>spring.</v>

1339
00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:09.670
<v Speaker 2>Disney,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1340
00:55:09.671 --> 00:55:14.671
<v Speaker 2>you're absolutely right in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation when you do deal with the </v>

1341
00:55:14.671 --> 00:55:17.721
<v Speaker 2>consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I would way rather be Mike </v>

1342
00:55:17.721 --> 00:55:18.000
<v Speaker 2>Pierce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Way,</v>

1343
00:55:18.001 --> 00:55:18.420
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

1344
00:55:18.421 --> 00:55:18.870
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

1345
00:55:18.871 --> 00:55:19.290
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

1346
00:55:19.291 --> 00:55:19.680
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1347
00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:24.800
<v Speaker 2>But the difference is that he has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>choice to let those submissions go.</v>

1348
00:55:25.141 --> 00:55:29.160
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a strike that's in motion </v>
<v Speaker 2>in during the middle of the contest.</v>

1349
00:55:29.161 --> 00:55:31.080
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In absolute legal time,</v>

1350
00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:32.430
<v Speaker 2>he connects.</v>

1351
00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:37.520
<v Speaker 2>Jeremy connects with a perfectly placed </v>
<v Speaker 2>shin and then a perfectly placed right </v>

1352
00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:37.520
<v Speaker 2>hand right afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>

1353
00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:39.210
<v Speaker 2>that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no referee stopping that fight.</v>

1354
00:55:39.211 --> 00:55:42.090
<v Speaker 2>There's no one he knows this </v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker's tapping.</v>

1355
00:55:42.210 --> 00:55:45.210
<v Speaker 2>He knows the referees touching them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where it gets weird.</v>

1356
00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:47.460
<v Speaker 2>Where it gets weird is he fucking knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1357
00:55:47.461 --> 00:55:48.240
<v Speaker 2>He knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1358
00:55:48.241 --> 00:55:51.630
<v Speaker 2>He knows anybody's ever put a heel hook </v>
<v Speaker 2>on anybody ever in their life knows that</v>

1359
00:55:51.631 --> 00:55:53.370
<v Speaker 2>guy was tapping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knew he was tapping.</v>

1360
00:55:53.371 --> 00:55:58.371
<v Speaker 2>You knew the ref was stepping in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knew the fight was over and he still </v>

1361
00:55:58.371 --> 00:55:58.371
<v Speaker 2>held on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1362
00:55:58.371 --> 00:55:59.400
<v Speaker 2>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I'm saying is when,</v>

1363
00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:01.500
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to submissions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1364
00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:04.500
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see the submission coming.</v>

1365
00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:09.650
<v Speaker 2>He wraps up his leg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you watch the fight that is right </v>

1366
00:56:09.650 --> 00:56:09.650
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he sees the submission coming.</v>

1367
00:56:09.650 --> 00:56:11.040
<v Speaker 2>He's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's ready to go.</v>

1368
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:12.390
<v Speaker 2>So as soon as he taps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

1369
00:56:12.391 --> 00:56:13.050
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>

1370
00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:18.200
<v Speaker 2>And then he held on a little bit long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When in these cases the referee is far </v>

1371
00:56:18.511 --> 00:56:21.840
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if the referee was right next to him,</v>

1372
00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:24.580
<v Speaker 2>he would stop the and that last part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a good.</v>

1373
00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:26.080
<v Speaker 2>That's a good argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Logically.</v>

1374
00:56:26.081 --> 00:56:31.081
<v Speaker 2>The problem with that is that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with a choice and when the guy </v>

1375
00:56:31.081 --> 00:56:31.081
<v Speaker 2>is holding onto a submission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a choice.</v>

1376
00:56:31.081 --> 00:56:33.440
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's say it's not a momentum there.</v>

1377
00:56:33.610 --> 00:56:36.490
<v Speaker 2>There've been fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where do knock someone out and again,</v>

1378
00:56:36.491 --> 00:56:38.290
<v Speaker 2>I love the violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

1379
00:56:38.291 --> 00:56:43.291
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying cut it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying you can't knock with </v>

1380
00:56:43.291 --> 00:56:43.291
<v Speaker 2>some are perhaps because it happens a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>

1381
00:56:43.291 --> 00:56:45.220
<v Speaker 2>When Dan Henderson bisbing in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation,</v>

1382
00:56:45.370 --> 00:56:50.370
<v Speaker 2>there is a chance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly what was going on </v>

1383
00:56:50.370 --> 00:56:50.370
<v Speaker 2>in Dan Harrison's brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was a shower.</v>

1384
00:56:50.370 --> 00:56:54.690
<v Speaker 2>He knows he's out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to fuck them up one more </v>

1385
00:56:54.690 --> 00:56:54.690
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1386
00:56:54.690 --> 00:56:57.150
<v Speaker 2>The reps too far away to stop that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then he kind of knows like she kinda</v>

1387
00:56:57.850 --> 00:56:59.050
<v Speaker 2>knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't kind of know.</v>

1388
00:56:59.051 --> 00:57:00.540
<v Speaker 2>You talked about in the postpaid press </v>
<v Speaker 2>call,</v>

1389
00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:03.760
<v Speaker 2>he said he wanted to shut him up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gave him that last punch to shut him up.</v>

1390
00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:05.890
<v Speaker 2>So there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all legal because the referee,</v>

1391
00:57:05.891 --> 00:57:10.891
<v Speaker 2>if the referee is not there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit's on him and that guy is in </v>

1392
00:57:10.891 --> 00:57:11.650
<v Speaker 2>survival mode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in full war mode.</v>

1393
00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:13.060
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked that.</v>

1394
00:57:13.061 --> 00:57:17.060
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is what happened with </v>
<v Speaker 2>with smart barth is exactly the same.</v>

1395
00:57:17.061 --> 00:57:18.760
<v Speaker 2>It's not here's where it would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

1396
00:57:18.761 --> 00:57:23.761
<v Speaker 2>He made a referee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the referee told him to stop and got </v>

1397
00:57:23.761 --> 00:57:24.970
<v Speaker 2>in front of him and he pushed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>referee aside,</v>

1398
00:57:24.971 --> 00:57:26.700
<v Speaker 2>instill smashed him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan,</v>

1399
00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:31.710
<v Speaker 2>that's happened before then it would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>worse than what he did because he's,</v>

1400
00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:37.240
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's sitting and concussed fighter and </v>

1401
00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:37.240
<v Speaker 2>one the referees already stopped the </v>
<v Speaker 2>contest.</v>

1402
00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:38.860
<v Speaker 2>This was just a race and this is in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rules.</v>

1403
00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:41.260
<v Speaker 2>That guy was talking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He decided to crack them.</v>

1404
00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:43.060
<v Speaker 2>He saw him going down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1405
00:57:43.061 --> 00:57:43.690
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch,</v>

1406
00:57:43.691 --> 00:57:45.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to give you one more before </v>
<v Speaker 2>the referee gets here.</v>

1407
00:57:46.290 --> 00:57:51.290
<v Speaker 2>We all know what it was there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the bathroom was out of position </v>

1408
00:57:51.290 --> 00:57:52.980
<v Speaker 2>wasn't exactly the same because I do all</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am aware of.</v>

1409
00:57:52.981 --> 00:57:57.981
<v Speaker 2>The Rep did stop him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was that the amount of time and </v>

1410
00:57:57.981 --> 00:58:01.000
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like you crack a dude like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that in sap and a bunch,</v>

1411
00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:03.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the fighter.</v>

1412
00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:08.040
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there have been times where a guy gets </v>

1413
00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:10.051
<v Speaker 2>crackly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knocks out the guys out because I'm not </v>

1414
00:58:10.051 --> 00:58:10.051
<v Speaker 2>going to hit them again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop it.</v>

1415
00:58:10.051 --> 00:58:10.051
<v Speaker 2>Rough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1416
00:58:10.051 --> 00:58:11.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could do that too.</v>

1417
00:58:11.610 --> 00:58:13.530
<v Speaker 2>Mark meal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a choice there so.</v>

1418
00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:15.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those guys are friends.</v>

1419
00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:20.760
<v Speaker 2>Big Difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She machida and Munoz who don't get me </v>

1420
00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:20.760
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>

1421
00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:21.040
<v Speaker 2>I would rather have the guy get hit one </v>
<v Speaker 2>more time.</v>

1422
00:58:21.041 --> 00:58:24.310
<v Speaker 2>I like when guys get Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like when guys get knocked out.</v>

1423
00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:25.490
<v Speaker 2>Enjoy them</v>

1424
00:58:25.550 --> 00:58:26.030
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He.</v>

1425
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:27.760
<v Speaker 3>This is where I don't agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1426
00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:29.250
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was kind of a stoppage.</v>

1427
00:58:29.251 --> 00:58:30.560
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That could have been questionable,</v>

1428
00:58:30.561 --> 00:58:32.130
<v Speaker 3>but the guy has done it a couple times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1429
00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:33.700
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so now they're,</v>

1430
00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:34.640
<v Speaker 3>now they're going like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1431
00:58:34.641 --> 00:58:36.830
<v Speaker 3>what the heck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the guy actually made a statement.</v>

1432
00:58:36.831 --> 00:58:41.831
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't fill the guy tapped because </v>

1433
00:58:41.831 --> 00:58:41.831
<v Speaker 3>the referee was on me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that's it.</v>

1434
00:58:41.831 --> 00:58:43.800
<v Speaker 2>That's key.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a key point were like,</v>

1435
00:58:43.801 --> 00:58:44.910
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the referees on you're like,</v>

1436
00:58:44.970 --> 00:58:48.000
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing with the reference </v>
<v Speaker 2>checking to make sure that he'll hook is</v>

1437
00:58:48.001 --> 00:58:48.840
<v Speaker 2>applied correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1438
00:58:48.841 --> 00:58:53.841
<v Speaker 2>he's not putting in your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's such a Goddamn dumb statement </v>

1439
00:58:53.841 --> 00:58:53.841
<v Speaker 2>statement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he,</v>

1440
00:58:53.841 --> 00:58:58.210
<v Speaker 2>if he actually say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sucks that he got cut because he's </v>

1441
00:58:58.210 --> 00:59:01.911
<v Speaker 2>always amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what every guy wants to be </v>

1442
00:59:01.911 --> 00:59:03.420
<v Speaker 2>because of he doesn't really listen and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he enjoys it.</v>

1443
00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:08.040
<v Speaker 2>He enjoys the reputation of being a guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>that rips needs a part because he's done</v>

1444
00:59:08.041 --> 00:59:10.530
<v Speaker 2>it before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he had to get cut.</v>

1445
00:59:10.590 --> 00:59:13.260
<v Speaker 2>I understand why Dana condom the condom </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

1446
00:59:13.470 --> 00:59:16.260
<v Speaker 2>but you got to have that animal back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bring them back,</v>

1447
00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:21.670
<v Speaker 2>let them suffer for a year and bring </v>
<v Speaker 2>them back because he's always a threat </v>

1448
00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:21.720
<v Speaker 2>to anybody at time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1449
00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:23.080
<v Speaker 2>especially at one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>17,</v>

1450
00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:24.500
<v Speaker 2>18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no other guys like that.</v>

1451
00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:27.980
<v Speaker 2>There's no other guys that could jump on</v>
<v Speaker 2>you with heel hooks like that.</v>

1452
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:31.840
<v Speaker 2>There's nobody that he says sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>edema.</v>

1453
00:59:31.870 --> 00:59:34.940
<v Speaker 2>Esther was never as dynamic is that dean</v>
<v Speaker 2>lister fought in the UFC a few times.</v>

1454
00:59:34.941 --> 00:59:37.400
<v Speaker 2>He'd never had that kind of crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scary performance.</v>

1455
00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:38.750
<v Speaker 2>Dean is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very good.</v>

1456
00:59:38.751 --> 00:59:41.330
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His grappling is world class.</v>

1457
00:59:41.331 --> 00:59:42.260
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's excellent,</v>

1458
00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:47.560
<v Speaker 2>but dean never had that kind of started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of appearance in the UFC were just </v>

1459
00:59:47.691 --> 00:59:49.630
<v Speaker 2>attack someone like a fucking wild </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>

1460
00:59:49.650 --> 00:59:51.820
<v Speaker 2>He's very explosive and dean wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1461
00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:54.110
<v Speaker 2>Dean was known as a mall or like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>grizzly bear.</v>

1462
00:59:54.250 --> 00:59:59.250
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't known as an explosive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were supposed to do a Jujitsu </v>

1463
00:59:59.250 --> 01:00:02.800
<v Speaker 2>match and I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it went down because I </v>

1464
01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:05.801
<v Speaker 2>think Paula Harris or somebody got hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think dean lister would get like </v>

1465
01:00:05.801 --> 01:00:07.880
<v Speaker 2>an intelligent mauler that's a good way </v>
<v Speaker 2>of scarring.</v>

1466
01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:13.480
<v Speaker 2>Intelligent Mahler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's very technical and he just knows </v>

1467
01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:13.480
<v Speaker 2>exactly where to be in the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>

1468
01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:15.290
<v Speaker 2>He's strong as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a beast dude.</v>

1469
01:00:15.291 --> 01:00:16.280
<v Speaker 2>He's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He like,</v>

1470
01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:19.610
<v Speaker 2>he'd always tell me he goes because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>trained with him and he's always like,</v>

1471
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:25.000
<v Speaker 2>no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like even when I'm feel like I'm in a </v>

1472
01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:25.000
<v Speaker 2>horrible position and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's many options here,</v>

1473
01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.560
<v Speaker 2>Jeremy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes he doesn't even know who'd</v>

1474
01:00:26.561 --> 01:00:28.040
<v Speaker 2>be like go back there again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do this.</v>

1475
01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:29.210
<v Speaker 2>He'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1476
01:00:29.570 --> 01:00:34.570
<v Speaker 2>And then like he'll just come up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like right there and it'll </v>

1477
01:00:34.570 --> 01:00:37.210
<v Speaker 2>have an escape for it and he's so he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>such a big dude but he rolls like 125 </v>

1478
01:00:37.210 --> 01:00:41.921
<v Speaker 2>pounds a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a real shame that gene list or had </v>

1479
01:00:41.921 --> 01:00:42.650
<v Speaker 2>to go into mma because like if there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

1480
01:00:42.651 --> 01:00:45.740
<v Speaker 2>I think there should be a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>professional jujitsu on television,</v>

1481
01:00:45.741 --> 01:00:48.110
<v Speaker 2>like on espn the same way they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>tennis.</v>

1482
01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:51.560
<v Speaker 2>Anything else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Figuring out how to do like an Abu Dhabi</v>

1483
01:00:51.561 --> 01:00:54.470
<v Speaker 2>style submission only thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put It on TV.</v>

1484
01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:59.500
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu would be for that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe maybe to come in the future for </v>

1485
01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:02.450
<v Speaker 2>like maybe like a UFC Jujitsu and </v>
<v Speaker 2>submission.</v>

1486
01:01:02.451 --> 01:01:05.630
<v Speaker 2>Wrestling would be a solid basis by </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

1487
01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:08.510
<v Speaker 2>I think just by itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu is still very,</v>

1488
01:01:08.511 --> 01:01:13.511
<v Speaker 2>very exciting and there's some guys that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are just never going to make that </v>

1489
01:01:13.511 --> 01:01:13.930
<v Speaker 2>transition as striking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like we were talking about with um,</v>

1490
01:01:14.050 --> 01:01:19.050
<v Speaker 2>with some guys just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just don't get there and some guys </v>

1491
01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:19.050
<v Speaker 2>do like febreeze,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shiver,</v>

1492
01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:23.560
<v Speaker 2>doom or Damien Maia or what have you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or Mark Munoz guys would get better and </v>

1493
01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:25.820
<v Speaker 2>better at striking and become like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous threat on their feet as well.</v>

1494
01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:29.450
<v Speaker 2>But it's be nice to see them just do </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're awesome at.</v>

1495
01:01:29.530 --> 01:01:32.420
<v Speaker 2>Like why should a soccer player also </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to learn how to play baseball?</v>

1496
01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:37.480
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or something right in between like </v>

1497
01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:37.480
<v Speaker 2>combat Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's right in between.</v>

1498
01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:38.180
<v Speaker 2>No striking standing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's wrestling standing,</v>

1499
01:01:38.181 --> 01:01:40.280
<v Speaker 2>but on the ground you could punch to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>face that makes.</v>

1500
01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:44.870
<v Speaker 2>It's right in the middle between Nogi </v>
<v Speaker 2>grappling and Nma.</v>

1501
01:01:44.871 --> 01:01:49.871
<v Speaker 2>It's not as quite as hardcore as I may,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's more exciting because on the </v>

1502
01:01:49.871 --> 01:01:51.070
<v Speaker 2>ground they'd be left stalling because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could punch to the face,</v>

1503
01:01:51.071 --> 01:01:56.071
<v Speaker 2>hit Samba guys almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like old ufc without like </v>

1504
01:01:56.071 --> 01:01:59.171
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe the violence that people </v>

1505
01:01:59.171 --> 01:02:00.851
<v Speaker 2>don't want to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have like this Russian Zombot </v>

1506
01:02:00.851 --> 01:02:00.851
<v Speaker 2>dude verse in this Brazilian in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Olympics.</v>

1507
01:02:00.851 --> 01:02:02.060
<v Speaker 2>I think that'd be incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1508
01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:04.270
<v Speaker 2>like the wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Jujitsu mix,</v>

1509
01:02:04.271 --> 01:02:05.070
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1510
01:02:05.090 --> 01:02:06.930
<v Speaker 2>We sick with people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they would,</v>

1511
01:02:07.130 --> 01:02:12.130
<v Speaker 2>they would cross train,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody would cross train and nobody </v>

1512
01:02:12.130 --> 01:02:13.160
<v Speaker 2>would ever do just Jujitsu versus samba.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just figure this out.</v>

1513
01:02:13.170 --> 01:02:15.740
<v Speaker 2>What style is better?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody would cross train,</v>

1514
01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:21.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to learn another guy's </v>

1515
01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:21.340
<v Speaker 2>techniques as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your cross train but not admitted.</v>

1516
01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:21.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1517
01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:24.330
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His combat sambo because they're kind of</v>

1518
01:02:24.331 --> 01:02:27.090
<v Speaker 1>doing mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they're also doing judo because</v>

1519
01:02:27.091 --> 01:02:32.091
<v Speaker 1>they have like judo Kimonos on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another inbetween Nma and </v>

1520
01:02:32.091 --> 01:02:33.690
<v Speaker 1>grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably the closest.</v>

1521
01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:38.820
<v Speaker 6>That's what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that those guys would face like a </v>

1522
01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:39.610
<v Speaker 6>Jujitsu guy because back in the early </v>
<v Speaker 6>days it was like a boxer versus this.</v>

1523
01:02:39.611 --> 01:02:44.611
<v Speaker 6>So if we got this in the Olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think everybody from some sort of </v>

1524
01:02:44.611 --> 01:02:44.611
<v Speaker 6>grappling with want to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

1525
01:02:44.611 --> 01:02:45.640
<v Speaker 6>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's compete with these people.</v>

1526
01:02:45.810 --> 01:02:49.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the safety level is amazingly high.</v>

1527
01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:50.640
<v Speaker 1>When you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1528
01:02:50.641 --> 01:02:52.640
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the injury rates and Nascar,</v>

1529
01:02:52.641 --> 01:02:55.200
<v Speaker 1>the injury rates and fucking Polo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1530
01:02:55.201 --> 01:02:57.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dudes get jacked riding horses,</v>

1531
01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:00.800
<v Speaker 1>man shows all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horse races guys fall off,</v>

1532
01:03:00.830 --> 01:03:02.360
<v Speaker 1>break their necks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets stomped.</v>

1533
01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:04.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of those go a year?</v>

1534
01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:05.420
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

1535
01:03:05.570 --> 01:03:08.300
<v Speaker 1>But you got to know when you've had </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

1536
01:03:08.330 --> 01:03:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

1537
01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:12.650
<v Speaker 1>That's probably one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>important things for fighter to be aware</v>

1538
01:03:12.651 --> 01:03:17.651
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every fighter in the gym knows at least </v>

1539
01:03:17.651 --> 01:03:17.651
<v Speaker 1>one guy that didn't figure it out.</v>

1540
01:03:17.651 --> 01:03:17.750
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1541
01:03:17.751 --> 01:03:18.500
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's sad.</v>

1542
01:03:18.501 --> 01:03:19.940
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he has a lot of heart,</v>

1543
01:03:19.941 --> 01:03:21.650
<v Speaker 6>but at the same time it's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 6>stupid.</v>

1544
01:03:21.651 --> 01:03:22.850
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like if I,</v>

1545
01:03:22.851 --> 01:03:25.580
<v Speaker 6>if I felt like I was getting knocked out</v>
<v Speaker 6>like three times in a row,</v>

1546
01:03:25.581 --> 01:03:26.380
<v Speaker 6>two times,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1547
01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:27.950
<v Speaker 6>I would just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1548
01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:29.570
<v Speaker 6>pay respect to my family,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1549
01:03:29.571 --> 01:03:32.060
<v Speaker 6>it'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>thank you for letting me enjoy this,</v>

1550
01:03:32.061 --> 01:03:33.110
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that's not.</v>

1551
01:03:33.111 --> 01:03:34.980
<v Speaker 6>Eventually I would just walk away and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1552
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.710
<v Speaker 6>eventually open up a gym or something </v>
<v Speaker 6>like that,</v>

1553
01:03:36.711 --> 01:03:36.890
<v Speaker 6>but</v>

1554
01:03:36.970 --> 01:03:39.370
<v Speaker 1>super hard to admit that though the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy's done,</v>

1555
01:03:39.371 --> 01:03:40.150
<v Speaker 1>they're always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1556
01:03:40.210 --> 01:03:45.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as anybody that there's always </v>

1557
01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:47.761
<v Speaker 1>wonders after a loss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you'd done something </v>

1558
01:03:47.761 --> 01:03:50.521
<v Speaker 1>differently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would the fight have played out </v>

1559
01:03:50.521 --> 01:03:52.531
<v Speaker 1>differently?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were trained with a different </v>

1560
01:03:52.531 --> 01:03:54.031
<v Speaker 1>coach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you have been able to see that </v>

1561
01:03:54.031 --> 01:03:54.031
<v Speaker 1>common?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had done this differently,</v>

1562
01:03:54.031 --> 01:03:54.850
<v Speaker 1>would that have happened and those </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts?</v>

1563
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:55.780
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never,</v>

1564
01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.450
<v Speaker 1>they never go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never get to</v>

1565
01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.830
<v Speaker 6>natural.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's natural to fill those thoughts and,</v>

1566
01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:05.160
<v Speaker 6>and wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because I actually been being clipped </v>

1567
01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:05.160
<v Speaker 6>before at a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>before that time,</v>

1568
01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:06.820
<v Speaker 6>I just thought I was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was almost like a Mike Tyson thing.</v>

1569
01:04:06.821 --> 01:04:11.821
<v Speaker 6>I felt like surreal and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I could just go in there and brawl and </v>

1570
01:04:11.821 --> 01:04:11.821
<v Speaker 6>just slug it out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

1571
01:04:11.821 --> 01:04:12.610
<v Speaker 6>Then eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1572
01:04:12.611 --> 01:04:16.260
<v Speaker 6>I actually went to some community,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like bad problems and stuff and uh,</v>

1573
01:04:16.570 --> 01:04:18.030
<v Speaker 6>I got caught by Eve's Edwards,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1574
01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:23.120
<v Speaker 6>he's a great dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But honestly I think I could have beat </v>

1575
01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:23.120
<v Speaker 6>them and I could have played that fight </v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot more different.</v>

1576
01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:23.860
<v Speaker 6>I was asking myself,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

1577
01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:24.570
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was,</v>

1578
01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:25.110
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>

1579
01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:26.170
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my weak Chin now,</v>

1580
01:04:26.171 --> 01:04:31.171
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've been hit with solid shots but that </v>

1581
01:04:31.171 --> 01:04:31.171
<v Speaker 6>just didn't land.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So finally I just,</v>

1582
01:04:31.171 --> 01:04:31.270
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I just talked to my coaches,</v>

1583
01:04:31.271 --> 01:04:34.180
<v Speaker 6>I talked to a sports psychologist and I </v>
<v Speaker 6>just pick myself up,</v>

1584
01:04:34.181 --> 01:04:35.020
<v Speaker 6>dust myself off.</v>

1585
01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:37.630
<v Speaker 6>I knew I was getting better in the gym </v>
<v Speaker 6>and the progress,</v>

1586
01:04:37.631 --> 01:04:38.980
<v Speaker 6>it just wasn't there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And again,</v>

1587
01:04:38.981 --> 01:04:41.080
<v Speaker 6>like just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we started lining things up.</v>

1588
01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:46.110
<v Speaker 6>Everything started connecting a lot </v>
<v Speaker 6>better and I ended up being a better </v>

1589
01:04:46.110 --> 01:04:46.520
<v Speaker 6>fighter from it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now if I was continued to going to,</v>

1590
01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:47.920
<v Speaker 6>and I still have fun with this dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1591
01:04:47.970 --> 01:04:49.600
<v Speaker 6>I'm still learning so much.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1592
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:54.750
<v Speaker 6>we could probably roll right now and I'd</v>
<v Speaker 6>probably learn something new or just </v>

1593
01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:54.750
<v Speaker 6>like a different way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a different route.</v>

1594
01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:59.430
<v Speaker 6>So I love that aspect about fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean I'm sitting here talking to you </v>

1595
01:04:59.430 --> 01:05:00.580
<v Speaker 6>Rogan and youtube as well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so I'm like,</v>

1596
01:05:00.790 --> 01:05:01.750
<v Speaker 6>I'm all pumped up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1597
01:05:01.751 --> 01:05:03.440
<v Speaker 6>I've never done this if it wasn't for </v>
<v Speaker 6>like mma.</v>

1598
01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:08.470
<v Speaker 6>So it's like changed my life and in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>moment I stop having fun with it and </v>

1599
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:09.160
<v Speaker 6>stop learning.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just like Charles Darwin said,</v>

1600
01:05:09.161 --> 01:05:11.870
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have the most the longest or survive</v>

1601
01:05:11.890 --> 01:05:14.680
<v Speaker 6>was the one that to adapt to change.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

1602
01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:18.280
<v Speaker 6>I just totally agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's some young beast is in the UFC.</v>

1603
01:05:18.290 --> 01:05:20.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm a Sergio Pettis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How old?</v>

1604
01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:20.800
<v Speaker 4>That kid?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just wasn't.</v>

1605
01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:23.070
<v Speaker 4>He just looks sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Awesome.</v>

<v Speaker 4>actually coming in.</v>

1607
01:05:25.181 --> 01:05:27.130
<v Speaker 4>So you gotta be able to adapt and </v>
<v Speaker 4>adjust.</v>

1608
01:05:27.131 --> 01:05:30.040
<v Speaker 4>You can't just be the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stand in the pocket type brawler dude.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You got it.</v>

1610
01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:33.450
<v Speaker 1>That's what's going to make you great is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that attitude to that being in love with</v>

1611
01:05:33.451 --> 01:05:38.451
<v Speaker 1>the idea of learning things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the beautiful things about </v>

1612
01:05:38.451 --> 01:05:38.790
<v Speaker 1>mma and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well even in Jujitsu,</v>

1613
01:05:38.791 --> 01:05:41.490
<v Speaker 1>it's like you never run out of things in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu,</v>

1614
01:05:41.491 --> 01:05:42.930
<v Speaker 1>you never learned that run out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques.</v>

1615
01:05:43.170 --> 01:05:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Now you add striking to that and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1616
01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:51.800
<v Speaker 1>and then wrestling to that and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a never ending ocean of </v>

1617
01:05:52.831 --> 01:05:53.850
<v Speaker 1>techniques out there.</v>

<v Speaker 4>shit like that.</v>

01:05:57.431 --> 01:05:58.620
<v Speaker 4>And spinning back kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1621
01:05:58.630 --> 01:06:01.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've just seen his videos of him kicking</v>

1622
01:06:01.181 --> 01:06:01.990
<v Speaker 4>the bag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1623
01:06:01.991 --> 01:06:04.860
<v Speaker 4>you're hitting spending back in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to be a,</v>

1624
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:07.300
<v Speaker 4>I was a taekwondo black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You haven't seen those videos?</v>

1625
01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:07.920
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1626
01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:10.150
<v Speaker 4>I never.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never saw myself.</v>

1627
01:06:10.270 --> 01:06:10.880
<v Speaker 4>I never knew you did.</v>

1628
01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:12.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was before I ever did that.</v>

1629
01:06:12.681 --> 01:06:17.510
<v Speaker 1>I used to teach taekwondo for a living </v>
<v Speaker 1>and won a bunch of taekwondo tournament.</v>

1630
01:06:17.830 --> 01:06:19.300
<v Speaker 4>But seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seriously,</v>

1631
01:06:19.301 --> 01:06:21.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm not just saying this and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 4>knows this.</v>

1632
01:06:21.370 --> 01:06:23.320
<v Speaker 4>Everyone used to think I was kissing his</v>
<v Speaker 4>ass when,</v>

1633
01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:24.880
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I would try to tell people.</v>

1634
01:06:24.881 --> 01:06:26.560
<v Speaker 4>But now there's video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now there's proof.</v>

1635
01:06:27.070 --> 01:06:32.070
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen anybody throw attorney </v>

1636
01:06:32.070 --> 01:06:32.500
<v Speaker 4>inside kick as hard as Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when he starts this coming up.</v>

1637
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:34.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You gotta look at the way he is.</v>

1638
01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:37.660
<v Speaker 4>He's teaching Jordan George St Pierre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's earlier than that,</v>

1639
01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:43.240
<v Speaker 4>but that's one of the interesting things</v>
<v Speaker 4>about Joyce before this,</v>

1640
01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:46.570
<v Speaker 4>before this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because this is what he's already asking</v>

1641
01:06:46.571 --> 01:06:51.571
<v Speaker 4>to record it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How'd you get involved involved in like </v>

1642
01:06:51.571 --> 01:06:51.571
<v Speaker 4>fighting man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1643
01:06:51.571 --> 01:06:52.600
<v Speaker 4>you have such a good grasp on things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1644
01:06:52.601 --> 01:06:55.960
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't even go to bars and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>order a paper view dead broke.</v>

1645
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:57.910
<v Speaker 4>And just a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just to hear your commentating though.</v>

1646
01:06:58.830 --> 01:06:59.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1647
01:06:59.701 --> 01:07:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Well thanks man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really appreciate that.</v>

1648
01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:06.910
<v Speaker 1>It was a taekwondo guy when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won the US Open and one of the </v>

1649
01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:08.610
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts state championship like </v>
<v Speaker 1>four years in a row.</v>

1650
01:07:09.170 --> 01:07:14.170
<v Speaker 1>That.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I went from that into </v>

1651
01:07:14.170 --> 01:07:14.170
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a three kickboxing bouts,</v>

1652
01:07:14.170 --> 01:07:16.750
<v Speaker 1>but it was doing that all while I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>still doing standup comedy.</v>

1653
01:07:16.751 --> 01:07:18.730
<v Speaker 1>And then I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to figure out what to do because I</v>

1654
01:07:18.731 --> 01:07:23.731
<v Speaker 1>was starting to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lost my last fight and I knew I lost </v>

1655
01:07:23.731 --> 01:07:23.731
<v Speaker 1>because I wasn't in good shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

1656
01:07:23.731 --> 01:07:28.411
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was fucking around too much and doing </v>

1657
01:07:28.411 --> 01:07:30.421
<v Speaker 1>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't focused and I knew I wasn't </v>

1658
01:07:30.421 --> 01:07:32.611
<v Speaker 1>training like I was when I was younger </v>
<v Speaker 1>so I had to make a big decision in my </v>

1659
01:07:32.611 --> 01:07:35.731
<v Speaker 1>big decision was abandoned all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whole world and just throw myself </v>

1660
01:07:35.731 --> 01:07:36.400
<v Speaker 1>into comedy plus there was no money man.</v>

1661
01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.200
<v Speaker 1>There was no UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was nowhere to go.</v>

1662
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:39.380
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1663
01:07:39.450 --> 01:07:44.450
<v Speaker 1>I went from comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on a television show called news </v>

1664
01:07:44.450 --> 01:07:47.230
<v Speaker 1>radio and from news radio I watched the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first UFC when I was there.</v>

1665
01:07:47.231 --> 01:07:47.970
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1666
01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:51.370
<v Speaker 1>I first saw it and like I think it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like probably like 95.</v>

1667
01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:55.180
<v Speaker 1>I probably caught it like year or two </v>
<v Speaker 1>after it had started.</v>

1668
01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:57.880
<v Speaker 1>I had heard about it and I watched it on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a vhs tape.</v>

1669
01:07:57.881 --> 01:07:58.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't have anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched the first one.</v>

1670
01:07:58.961 --> 01:08:02.320
<v Speaker 1>I think I watched UFC too because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think the first one wasn't available for</v>

1671
01:08:02.321 --> 01:08:05.320
<v Speaker 1>some reasons or some copyright issues or</v>
<v Speaker 1>what have you.</v>

1672
01:08:05.321 --> 01:08:10.321
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what it hit the exact </v>

1673
01:08:10.321 --> 01:08:10.321
<v Speaker 1>reality was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I remember watching the hoists.</v>

1674
01:08:10.321 --> 01:08:10.330
<v Speaker 1>Gracie strangled the fuck out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody going,</v>

1675
01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:13.480
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I felt first of all,</v>

1676
01:08:13.650 --> 01:08:15.290
<v Speaker 1>all my years of type window,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1677
01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:16.400
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm helpless.</v>

1678
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:20.030
<v Speaker 2>Like I thought I was just going to kick </v>
<v Speaker 2>dudes in the head and I'm like,</v>

1679
01:08:20.031 --> 01:08:21.300
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even realize that guy could </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1680
01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:23.810
<v Speaker 2>just manhandled me like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I went to,</v>

1681
01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:27.080
<v Speaker 2>I went to crossing Gracie's place in </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] 96.</v>

1682
01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:32.110
<v Speaker 2>I started training there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was back when Vito was making his </v>

1683
01:08:32.110 --> 01:08:32.110
<v Speaker 2>debut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They used to call him victor.</v>

1684
01:08:32.110 --> 01:08:33.890
<v Speaker 2>He's convicted Gracie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I,</v>

1685
01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:36.800
<v Speaker 2>when I interviewed him on UFC 12,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I called them Victor Gracie.</v>

1686
01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:38.930
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what everybody called him.</v>

1687
01:08:38.931 --> 01:08:41.390
<v Speaker 2>And then he was getting sued by Horian </v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>

1688
01:08:41.391 --> 01:08:44.180
<v Speaker 2>So he had to drop the Gracie name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was taking it because of Carlson.</v>

1689
01:08:44.810 --> 01:08:49.810
<v Speaker 2>So that's when I started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I met Eddie and probably like </v>

1690
01:08:49.810 --> 01:08:49.810
<v Speaker 2>98,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started John jocks.</v>

1691
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:53.250
<v Speaker 2>I met Eddie around there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1692
01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:57.380
<v Speaker 2>I started smoking weed about 99,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2000.</v>

1693
01:08:57.530 --> 01:08:59.810
<v Speaker 2>One was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it kind of knows us before.</v>

1694
01:08:59.810 --> 01:09:00.920
<v Speaker 2>Fear factor though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1695
01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:04.130
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was 2000.</v>

1696
01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:09.360
<v Speaker 2>You had a calm demeanor on there when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember this one time because I knew I </v>

1697
01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:11.750
<v Speaker 2>wasn't a big fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big fight guy.</v>

1698
01:09:11.751 --> 01:09:15.290
<v Speaker 2>And then just the way there's this guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>having like this attitude and this crazy</v>

1699
01:09:15.291 --> 01:09:15.830
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

1700
01:09:15.831 --> 01:09:16.910
<v Speaker 2>whoa Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1701
01:09:16.911 --> 01:09:18.770
<v Speaker 2>chill out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the guy like tried to like fear</v>

1702
01:09:18.771 --> 01:09:20.930
<v Speaker 2>factor one and he just had like a calm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calm demeanor.</v>

1703
01:09:20.931 --> 01:09:21.440
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1704
01:09:21.441 --> 01:09:22.590
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe's pretty cool dude.</v>

1705
01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:24.380
<v Speaker 2>Or you can just tell me like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1706
01:09:24.381 --> 01:09:25.670
<v Speaker 2>Joe would have messed him up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

1707
01:09:25.671 --> 01:09:30.671
<v Speaker 2>you know what that guy was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was told about him before we ever did </v>

1708
01:09:30.671 --> 01:09:34.331
<v Speaker 2>the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were telling me that this guy's a </v>

1709
01:09:34.331 --> 01:09:36.250
<v Speaker 2>kind of a loose cannon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He attacked a counselor on one show and </v>

1710
01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:36.890
<v Speaker 2>he threw his wife to the ground on </v>
<v Speaker 2>another show.</v>

1711
01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:39.440
<v Speaker 2>Like he was of day alarm in the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>

1712
01:09:39.710 --> 01:09:41.240
<v Speaker 2>It's exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never know what's going on.</v>

1713
01:09:41.270 --> 01:09:46.270
<v Speaker 2>They knew he worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Him and his wife were fucking screaming </v>

<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1746
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.070
<v Speaker 2>this guy obviously has</v>

1747
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:16.050
<v Speaker 4>some type of martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like self control,</v>

1748

<v Speaker 4>So he's working.</v>

1749
01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:21.390
<v Speaker 4>You're working on a lead leg side kick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I conor Mcgregor.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1751
01:11:22.981 --> 01:11:25.260
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's been around a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 4>since connor mcgregor.</v>

1752
01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:28.680
<v Speaker 4>I want to give him the credit for it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I remember way back.</v>

1753
01:11:28.710 --> 01:11:29.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not too many people.</v>

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:30.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who else?</v>

1755
01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:36.810

<v Speaker 4>Like Jon Jon Jones did it on Jones says </v>

1757
01:11:41.811 --> 01:11:42.480
<v Speaker 4>it to the knee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a very v towards the body.</v>

1758
01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:46.110
<v Speaker 4>He's got a legacy to the body and </v>
<v Speaker 4>dropped me to remember that.</v>

1759
01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:51.740
<v Speaker 4>It's cool to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I also use like a lot of stuff </v>

1760
01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:54.351
<v Speaker 4>because I trained with Alex Gustafsson </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he uses a lot of like real trickery </v>

1761
01:11:54.351 --> 01:11:55.150
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he'll get like hip to hip with you,</v>

1762
01:11:55.151 --> 01:12:00.151
<v Speaker 4>like where you're standing and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>he'll just go hip to hip and then just </v>

1763
01:12:00.151 --> 01:12:01.110
<v Speaker 4>sweep you and just Kinda Kinda almost </v>
<v Speaker 4>makes you look stupid.</v>

1764
01:12:01.710 --> 01:12:06.240
<v Speaker 4>Dominick Cruz style down on your toes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he,</v>

1765
01:12:06.510 --> 01:12:09.750
<v Speaker 4>he purposely emulated dominick Cruz.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not a coincidence,</v>

1766
01:12:09.751 --> 01:12:11.360
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That they moved the sign.</v>

1767
01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:13.170
<v Speaker 4>Just think he was just light on the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>coaches.</v>

<v Speaker 4>on your toes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being athletic,</v>

<v Speaker 4>He said he thought he was going to go </v>
<v Speaker 4>low and then caught them high.</v>

1829
01:14:23.470 --> 01:14:26.370
<v Speaker 4>Julie's got that long right hand too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She.</v>

1830
01:14:26.410 --> 01:14:28.930
<v Speaker 4>She's fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He launches that right hand at you.</v>

1831
01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:33.960
<v Speaker 4>Throw,</v>
<v Speaker 4>throws a lot of it and it covers a lot </v>

1832
01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:33.960
<v Speaker 4>of distance to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1833
01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:34.630
<v Speaker 4>it's like almost like a cost check back </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the day,</v>

1834
01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:39.640
<v Speaker 4>but caution with wing his a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now you see in guys like throw the </v>

1835
01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:43.941
<v Speaker 4>straight right hand and catch guys </v>
<v Speaker 4>before they're able to hit the hook on </v>

1836
01:14:43.941 --> 01:14:46.831
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Catch that Chin sometimes putting put </v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1838
01:14:46.831 --> 01:14:48.400
<v Speaker 4>The Way Varner completes that right hand</v>
<v Speaker 4>is very straight.</v>

1839
01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:50.620
<v Speaker 4>It's very strict.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He landed that all through a set ups.</v>

1840
01:14:50.621 --> 01:14:53.050
<v Speaker 4>He was smart that time he immediately </v>
<v Speaker 4>came out,</v>

1841
01:14:53.051 --> 01:14:55.180
<v Speaker 4>take barboza down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know Barboza was going to get up.</v>

1842
01:14:55.181 --> 01:14:57.910
<v Speaker 4>So what does he do that next time acts </v>
<v Speaker 4>like he's going to go down.</v>

1843
01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:00.190
<v Speaker 4>Of course you got to respect it because </v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy just took you down.</v>

1844
01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:01.570
<v Speaker 4>Boom.</v>

<v Speaker 4>bad streak where he's losing the guys </v>

1848
01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:15.200
<v Speaker 4>should never lose to lost his motivation</v>
<v Speaker 4>was going back to college and then all </v>

<v Speaker 4>You're a superstar.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You're on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's right there at your fingertips.</v>

<v Speaker 4>camps together.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Get your shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's right there.</v>

1856
01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:36.140
<v Speaker 4>A celebrity status and not waking up and</v>
<v Speaker 4>working at a factory or something.</v>

1857
01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:39.730
<v Speaker 4>You got to keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to look at it as like,</v>

1858
01:15:39.731 --> 01:15:40.210
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

1859
01:15:40.450 --> 01:15:45.450
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you could look at it realistically </v>

1860
01:15:45.450 --> 01:15:48.181
<v Speaker 4>like maybe I won't get the belt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm going to fucking try my hardest </v>

1861
01:15:48.181 --> 01:15:49.630
<v Speaker 4>and then in the meantime I'm not going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to work a regular fucking job.</v>

1862
01:15:49.870 --> 01:15:51.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to try to parlay this into </v>
<v Speaker 4>some other shit.</v>

1863
01:15:53.010 --> 01:15:57.000
<v Speaker 4>This the excitement they miss that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't have regular days by him.</v>

1864
01:15:57.100 --> 01:16:01.950
<v Speaker 4>Regular Day job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a slow drone drawn draw.</v>

1865
01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:05.590
<v Speaker 4>I worked and it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was horrible.</v>

1866
01:16:05.591 --> 01:16:06.720
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

1867
01:16:06.750 --> 01:16:08.410
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my grandfather had a,</v>

1868
01:16:08.770 --> 01:16:10.360
<v Speaker 4>had uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>told me to quit a job,</v>

1869
01:16:10.361 --> 01:16:11.470
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was kind of skeptical.</v>

1870
01:16:11.471 --> 01:16:14.020
<v Speaker 4>And then my old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>old girlfriend at the time,</v>

1871
01:16:14.021 --> 01:16:16.630
<v Speaker 4>like I remember one time I had to stay </v>
<v Speaker 4>at her parents' house just because I was</v>

1872
01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:19.210
<v Speaker 4>believing in this dream and I was just </v>
<v Speaker 4>starting out.</v>

1873
01:16:19.211 --> 01:16:21.010
<v Speaker 4>I didn't really have much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I struggled a lot.</v>

1874
01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:21.520
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1875
01:16:21.850 --> 01:16:23.550
<v Speaker 4>I remember her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>her dad was just like,</v>

1876
01:16:23.551 --> 01:16:25.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a fight doesn't pay the bills.</v>

1877
01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:27.140
<v Speaker 4>I remember just looking at this guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1878
01:16:27.190 --> 01:16:29.320
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some shit on my dream,</v>

1879
01:16:29.321 --> 01:16:30.760
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What'd you just do?</v>

1880
01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:32.890
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Went away.</v>

1881
01:16:33.070 --> 01:16:34.720
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it a weird feedback?</v>

1882
01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:36.580
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it was your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where's your phone?</v>

1883
01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:38.730
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that what it was.</v>

1884
01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:40.810
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was a feedback thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1885
01:16:40.811 --> 01:16:45.811
<v Speaker 4>yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a fucking crazy dream to believe </v>

1886
01:16:45.811 --> 01:16:45.811
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1887
01:16:45.811 --> 01:16:45.811
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1888
01:16:45.811 --> 01:16:46.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's got its ups and downs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1889
01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:48.550
<v Speaker 4>I could imagine like all the crazy crap,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1890
01:16:48.551 --> 01:16:50.600
<v Speaker 4>Varner and like half these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's probably mad,</v>

1891
01:16:50.610 --> 01:16:51.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the hell.</v>

1892
01:16:51.431 --> 01:16:53.140
<v Speaker 4>And he was scared to death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He admitted it.</v>

1893
01:16:53.190 --> 01:16:56.350
<v Speaker 4>He Barboza I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but especially Barboza.</v>

1894
01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:58.780
<v Speaker 4>That guy's a killer dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like human shit.</v>

1895
01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:02.710
<v Speaker 4>Jimmy Carter said he was shaking before </v>
<v Speaker 4>foes are coming off of that.</v>

1896
01:17:02.710 --> 01:17:05.620
<v Speaker 4>Terry Edom knock out one of the worst </v>
<v Speaker 4>knockouts ever in the UFC.</v>

1897
01:17:05.710 --> 01:17:08.500
<v Speaker 4>I train with that guy a long time ago </v>
<v Speaker 4>down in Florida through Hermes,</v>

1898
01:17:08.501 --> 01:17:11.360
<v Speaker 4>Franco,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who I was hanging out with a back of the</v>

1899
01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.470
<v Speaker 4>day and we went to the armory and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

1900
01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:18.580
<v Speaker 4>we train with Barboza and I just </v>
<v Speaker 4>remember it just as more Thai was </v>

1901
01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:18.580
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really good.</v>

1902
01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:19.250
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was just like,</v>

1903
01:17:19.251 --> 01:17:20.210
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is this guy fight,</v>

1904
01:17:20.211 --> 01:17:20.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1905
01:17:20.571 --> 01:17:22.400
<v Speaker 4>this guy should be fighting here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1906
01:17:22.401 --> 01:17:23.940
<v Speaker 4>And I was already in UFC at the time </v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1907
01:17:24.090 --> 01:17:24.950
<v Speaker 4>and I guess they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1908
01:17:24.951 --> 01:17:26.540
<v Speaker 4>he's working on his ground or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's,</v>

1909
01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:28.100
<v Speaker 4>he's really good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good striking.</v>

1910
01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:31.380
<v Speaker 4>He's working on his wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's explosive athlete and he's a big 55</v>

1911
01:17:31.381 --> 01:17:31.940
<v Speaker 4>or two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

1912
01:17:31.970 --> 01:17:33.650
<v Speaker 4>That guy's a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1913
01:17:33.710 --> 01:17:34.560
<v Speaker 4>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1914
01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:39.580
<v Speaker 4>the weight cutting thing is really </v>
<v Speaker 4>fascinating because when most people </v>

1915
01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:41.420
<v Speaker 4>hear that a guy who fights at 155 pounds</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you fight it 145 pounds though,</v>

1916
01:17:41.450 --> 01:17:43.580
<v Speaker 4>they assume you're actually 145 pounds.</v>

1917
01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:46.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like manual Jesus.</v>

1918
01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:47.630
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that work?</v>

1919
01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:53.200
<v Speaker 4>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tyron Woodley is the best example of </v>

1920
01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:53.200
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way that dude looks to be 170</v>

1921
01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:57.281
<v Speaker 4>pounds dense bro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the hell he always </v>

1922
01:17:57.281 --> 01:17:58.670
<v Speaker 4>when he gets him and Hector Lombard or </v>
<v Speaker 4>just going to take over the top.</v>

1923
01:17:58.671 --> 01:18:00.470
<v Speaker 4>I think that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just,</v>

1924
01:18:00.650 --> 01:18:01.820
<v Speaker 4>that's just what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1925
01:18:01.821 --> 01:18:03.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that would be an amazing fight.</v>

1926
01:18:03.831 --> 01:18:06.850
<v Speaker 4>Hector Lombard versus tyrone Woodley </v>
<v Speaker 4>holder.</v>

1927
01:18:06.890 --> 01:18:11.890
<v Speaker 4>They're both American top team.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They probably never would find it or </v>

1928
01:18:11.890 --> 01:18:14.720
<v Speaker 4>they wouldn't fight until they became </v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely coming back.</v>

1929
01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:15.980
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thiago Alves.</v>

1930
01:18:15.981 --> 01:18:18.020
<v Speaker 4>We're probably as soon to see him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Scrap again.</v>

1931
01:18:18.021 --> 01:18:18.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope so.</v>

1932
01:18:18.891 --> 01:18:20.510
<v Speaker 4>I love that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Great Guy.</v>

1933
01:18:20.511 --> 01:18:25.511
<v Speaker 4>Fun To watch sighting fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he's not an unfortunate series of </v>

1934
01:18:25.511 --> 01:18:27.670
<v Speaker 4>injury,</v>
<v Speaker 4>back surgery,</v>

1935
01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:32.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>impress the shit on me is donald </v>

1936

<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

1937
01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:36.930
<v Speaker 4>Fight with Evan Dunham.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The coolest thing about that was Evan </v>

1938
01:18:36.930 --> 01:18:36.930
<v Speaker 4>Dunham.</v>

1939
01:18:36.930 --> 01:18:37.880
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

01:18:37.881 --> 01:18:38.560
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Half some perfectly gets on top,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gets the triangle,</v>

1942
01:18:42.051 --> 01:18:44.180
<v Speaker 4>escaped the triangle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>goes right into an Omoplata,</v>

1943
01:18:44.330 --> 01:18:47.180
<v Speaker 4>gets the Oma plot the sweep width,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the past donaldson.</v>

1944
01:18:47.181 --> 01:18:49.310
<v Speaker 4>Ronnie's inside controls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just some amazing,</v>

1945
01:18:49.311 --> 01:18:51.620
<v Speaker 4>beautiful Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get back up,</v>

1946
01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:57.460
<v Speaker 4>they throw down again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dunham ends up on his back again with </v>

1947
01:18:57.460 --> 01:19:00.791
<v Speaker 4>another deep sweep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He gets on top right into another </v>

1948
01:19:00.791 --> 01:19:02.300
<v Speaker 4>triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But this time he finishes them serious,</v>

1949
01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:06.680
<v Speaker 4>serious Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I heard them talking about going down to</v>

1950
01:19:06.681 --> 01:19:09.010
<v Speaker 4>145 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I've actually fought serone.</v>

1951
01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:11.240
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he ended up breaking my eye orbit in the</v>

1952
01:19:11.241 --> 01:19:12.230
<v Speaker 4>first round.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1953
01:19:12.231 --> 01:19:14.060
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't like he hit real hard and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1954
01:19:14.061 --> 01:19:15.500
<v Speaker 4>what I was feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was feeling as kicks,</v>

1955
01:19:15.501 --> 01:19:17.470
<v Speaker 4>but it was just a precise shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1956
01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:18.500
<v Speaker 4>astronomy is more time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1957
01:19:18.501 --> 01:19:19.740
<v Speaker 4>When he's on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's on duty.</v>

1958
01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:22.910
<v Speaker 4>He's a scary dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a big dude at 155 pounds.</v>

1959
01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:25.400
<v Speaker 4>And for him to go down to 145,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1960
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:26.330
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1961
01:19:26.331 --> 01:19:28.790
<v Speaker 4>I think he's going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's so 30 is a big dude.</v>

1962
01:19:28.791 --> 01:19:31.940
<v Speaker 4>If he can make it and reload,</v>
<v Speaker 4>reload the right way.</v>

1963
01:19:31.941 --> 01:19:33.860
<v Speaker 4>And I imagine that he probably will if </v>
<v Speaker 4>he has a,</v>

1964
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:35.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's training with Jackson so he's got a</v>

1965
01:19:35.571 --> 01:19:37.580
<v Speaker 4>good camp and good team behind him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's going to drop.</v>

1966
01:19:37.581 --> 01:19:40.400
<v Speaker 4>I think that was a room I think I read </v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere where he said no,</v>

1967
01:19:40.890 --> 01:19:42.610
<v Speaker 4>I talked about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it ain't going gonna happen.</v>

1968
01:19:42.770 --> 01:19:44.900
<v Speaker 4>Usually people talk about cutting off or</v>
<v Speaker 4>they lose.</v>

1969
01:19:44.901 --> 01:19:46.530
<v Speaker 4>He just beat the shit out of Evan </v>
<v Speaker 4>Dunham.</v>

1970
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:49.940
<v Speaker 4>Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he looked good to window.</v>

1971
01:19:49.941 --> 01:19:54.941
<v Speaker 4>He had a brief window he could have </v>
<v Speaker 4>pulled out of that triangle where he's </v>

1972
01:19:54.941 --> 01:19:55.760
<v Speaker 4>taking a little break there and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you just locked it up.</v>

1973
01:19:56.520 --> 01:20:01.520
<v Speaker 4>Evan Dunham is a tough motherfucker and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the tap him is even more impressive.</v>

1974
01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:06.830
<v Speaker 4>The train with them when we're dominant </v>
<v Speaker 4>cruises camp with Uriah Faber when </v>

1975
01:20:06.830 --> 01:20:08.160
<v Speaker 4>they're are on the show,</v>

1976
01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:11.750
<v Speaker 6>we're a team of lance was always over at</v>
<v Speaker 6>drysdales and we've got to change.</v>

1977
01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:13.770
<v Speaker 6>I got a chance to roll with Evan Dunham </v>
<v Speaker 6>and do it.</v>

1978
01:20:13.771 --> 01:20:15.570
<v Speaker 6>He was just.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was ferocious on the ground.</v>

1979
01:20:15.670 --> 01:20:16.600
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>his very good.</v>

1980
01:20:16.601 --> 01:20:21.601
<v Speaker 7>That's when he tapped Efrain Escudero.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That was a real wake up call for a lot </v>

1981
01:20:21.601 --> 01:20:25.021
<v Speaker 7>of people like this kid's ground games.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right before Evan Denim made his UFC </v>

1982
01:20:25.241 --> 01:20:26.740
<v Speaker 7>debut.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't know anything about them.</v>

1983
01:20:26.741 --> 01:20:28.960
<v Speaker 7>Just one of those dudes you've never </v>
<v Speaker 7>heard of Gerald to.</v>

1984
01:20:28.961 --> 01:20:30.640
<v Speaker 7>There's a guy named Evan Dunham.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He,</v>

1985
01:20:30.670 --> 01:20:34.190
<v Speaker 7>I think he fought.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I forget,</v>

1986
01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:36.270
<v Speaker 7>but he said he's trusted me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Put all your money on.</v>

1987
01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:38.050
<v Speaker 7>I haven't done them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just rolled with them all week.</v>

1988
01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:41.590
<v Speaker 7>The guys trashed me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Gerald's awesome.</v>

1989
01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:42.880
<v Speaker 7>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Evan Dunham.</v>

1990
01:20:42.881 --> 01:20:43.750
<v Speaker 7>So I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

1991
01:20:43.810 --> 01:20:44.170
<v Speaker 7>okay.</v>

1992
01:20:44.350 --> 01:20:44.830
<v Speaker 6>Leave it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1993
01:20:44.870 --> 01:20:47.260
<v Speaker 6>When he fought Tyson Griffin,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of his training partners,</v>

1994
01:20:47.261 --> 01:20:50.740
<v Speaker 6>I thought that was really good because </v>
<v Speaker 6>Tyson Griffin's real solid on the ground</v>

1995
01:20:50.741 --> 01:20:51.140
<v Speaker 6>too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

1996
01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:56.240
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that fight Dunham was just had this bat </v>

1997
01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:57.280
<v Speaker 6>control that was crazy and control the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fight will just fall back control.</v>

1998
01:20:57.281 --> 01:20:59.180
<v Speaker 6>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>on,</v>

1999
01:20:59.190 --> 01:21:00.190
<v Speaker 6>on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>on top point.</v>

2000
01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:01.620
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's very good man.</v>

2001
01:21:01.650 --> 01:21:05.880
<v Speaker 7>I just was completely blown away by how </v>
<v Speaker 7>good serone looked.</v>

2002
01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:07.740
<v Speaker 7>So Ronnie was just on fire</v>

2003
01:21:07.930 --> 01:21:09.340
<v Speaker 6>when he's on fire,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's on fire,</v>

2004
01:21:09.341 --> 01:21:14.341
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think I think maybe had a little </v>

2005
01:21:14.341 --> 01:21:15.170
<v Speaker 6>personal issue is that that fight with </v>
<v Speaker 6>dos Anjos and uh,</v>

2006
01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:16.360
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he just bounced back,</v>

2007
01:21:16.361 --> 01:21:21.361
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in Germany is one of those guys who </v>

2008
01:21:21.361 --> 01:21:22.591
<v Speaker 6>likes to stay active and get after it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's interesting to see what he's </v>

2009
01:21:22.591 --> 01:21:22.591
<v Speaker 6>going to do.</v>

2010
01:21:22.591 --> 01:21:22.591
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fuck yeah,</v>

2011
01:21:22.591 --> 01:21:24.950
<v Speaker 7>that's going to be really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2012
01:21:24.951 --> 01:21:26.330
<v Speaker 7>what did you think about the main event?</v>

2013
01:21:26.970 --> 01:21:29.220
<v Speaker 6>Me Personally,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think Hendrick's one,</v>

2014
01:21:29.221 --> 01:21:32.640
<v Speaker 6>I think he completed all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all of what the octagon rules are about,</v>

2015
01:21:32.641 --> 01:21:33.660
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>damage,</v>

2016
01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:35.550
<v Speaker 6>octagon control,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2017
01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:37.950
<v Speaker 6>what he landed to take downs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He busted up his face,</v>

2018
01:21:37.951 --> 01:21:42.951
<v Speaker 6>he controlled the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He made it a great fight and almost he </v>

2019
01:21:42.951 --> 01:21:43.230
<v Speaker 6>almost knocked him out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then,</v>

2020
01:21:43.231 --> 01:21:44.010
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2021
01:21:44.011 --> 01:21:46.140
<v Speaker 6>at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>gsp one and that,</v>

2022
01:21:46.141 --> 01:21:47.250
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the decision.</v>

2023
01:21:47.251 --> 01:21:49.500
<v Speaker 6>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think a lot of better things are gonna</v>

2024
01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:52.800
<v Speaker 6>come from that because Dana white and </v>
<v Speaker 6>immediately calling out these,</v>

2025
01:21:52.830 --> 01:21:57.830
<v Speaker 6>these judges and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and probably getting things going on </v>

2026
01:21:57.830 --> 01:22:00.201
<v Speaker 6>that end.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it'll be interesting to see what </v>

2027
01:22:00.201 --> 01:22:00.201
<v Speaker 6>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I think he needs a rematch.</v>

2028
01:22:00.201 --> 01:22:00.410
<v Speaker 7>The,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think you're right about,</v>

2029
01:22:00.430 --> 01:22:01.000
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

2030
01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:06.180
<v Speaker 7>the judges.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think there's also not just the </v>

2031
01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:06.180
<v Speaker 7>judges,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the,</v>

2032
01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:10.300
<v Speaker 7>the judging,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when you look at the scoring system </v>

2033
01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:10.300
<v Speaker 7>that's currently in place is not that </v>
<v Speaker 7>crazy.</v>

2034
01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:13.430
<v Speaker 7>The judging is not that crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not that off at least this fight,</v>

2035
01:22:13.820 --> 01:22:17.300
<v Speaker 7>but the scoring system's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The scoring system is terrible.</v>

2036
01:22:17.330 --> 01:22:22.330
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't work when you can have around</v>
<v Speaker 7>like the second round we're Hendrix had </v>

2037
01:22:22.330 --> 01:22:27.041
<v Speaker 7>GSP and all sorts of trouble and that </v>
<v Speaker 7>round and the first round or scored </v>

2038
01:22:27.041 --> 01:22:28.070
<v Speaker 7>exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're both 10,</v>

2039
01:22:28.071 --> 01:22:33.071
<v Speaker 7>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 7>one way or another on either judges' </v>

2040
01:22:33.071 --> 01:22:33.071
<v Speaker 7>scorecard.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's crazy.</v>

2041
01:22:33.071 --> 01:22:34.490
<v Speaker 7>Those are not the same rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 7>One round.</v>

2042
01:22:34.491 --> 01:22:37.460
<v Speaker 7>You had a good struggle that I think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2043
01:22:37.461 --> 01:22:40.520
<v Speaker 7>one guy did more damage,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but one guy went for a submission.</v>

2044
01:22:40.610 --> 01:22:42.410
<v Speaker 7>It's a sort of debatable 10,</v>
<v Speaker 7>nine round.</v>

2045
01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:46.310
<v Speaker 7>But the second round was Johnny </v>
<v Speaker 7>Hendricks clanging.</v>

2046
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:50.390
<v Speaker 7>George has wobbled,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hasn't been all sorts of trouble.</v>

2047
01:22:50.450 --> 01:22:54.680
<v Speaker 7>Johnny swarming on him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How the fuck are those two rounds?</v>

2048
01:22:54.710 --> 01:22:58.340
<v Speaker 7>Quantifiably the same.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's preposterous.</v>

2049
01:22:58.730 --> 01:23:02.360
<v Speaker 7>They gotta fix that and if they don't </v>
<v Speaker 7>fix that big nine,</v>

2050
01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:04.850
<v Speaker 7>eight and seven around that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I,</v>

2051
01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:10.000
<v Speaker 7>I think this may at least in some way </v>
<v Speaker 7>motivate the conversation.</v>

2052
01:23:10.270 --> 01:23:14.200
<v Speaker 7>I think if time goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you Ma'am and may last 20 years,</v>

2053
01:23:14.530 --> 01:23:19.530
<v Speaker 7>if we're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're going to figure out that the </v>

2054
01:23:19.530 --> 01:23:21.280
<v Speaker 7>system needs to be overhauled and this </v>
<v Speaker 7>idea of 10 points every round is fucking</v>

2055
01:23:21.281 --> 01:23:26.281
<v Speaker 7>silly about where we're acting.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like there's a thing in place that we </v>

2056
01:23:26.281 --> 01:23:29.080
<v Speaker 7>have to follow for a new sport and </v>
<v Speaker 7>that's fucking stupid.</v>

2057
01:23:29.410 --> 01:23:30.040
<v Speaker 6>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't,</v>

2058
01:23:30.041 --> 01:23:35.041
<v Speaker 6>you never know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no consistency with these </v>

2059
01:23:35.041 --> 01:23:35.041
<v Speaker 6>judges.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you know,</v>

2060
01:23:35.041 --> 01:23:36.970
<v Speaker 6>one thing I did not want to do in Brazil</v>
<v Speaker 6>was go to a decision and I was like,</v>

2061
01:23:36.971 --> 01:23:41.971
<v Speaker 6>if this is closer and to give it to him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When I went up and I had a close fight </v>

2062
01:23:41.971 --> 01:23:45.301
<v Speaker 6>with Sam style,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought they're going to give it to </v>

2063
01:23:45.301 --> 01:23:45.301
<v Speaker 6>him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

2064
01:23:45.301 --> 01:23:45.301
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what,</v>

2065
01:23:45.301 --> 01:23:45.301
<v Speaker 6>you did everything I knew in my heart.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wanted to fight.</v>

2066
01:23:45.301 --> 01:23:47.060
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>thankfully I ended up getting,</v>

2067
01:23:47.061 --> 01:23:50.610
<v Speaker 6>getting that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but don't just fights.</v>

2068
01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:51.460
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>close fights.</v>

2069
01:23:51.461 --> 01:23:53.590
<v Speaker 6>Phil Davis,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought be Leo.</v>

2070
01:23:53.591 --> 01:23:56.950
<v Speaker 6>Machida two out of three rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was a very big controversial fight and</v>

2071
01:23:56.951 --> 01:23:58.150
<v Speaker 6>then people were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nah,</v>

2072
01:23:58.151 --> 01:23:59.110
<v Speaker 6>Leo,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Leo to one.</v>

2073
01:23:59.111 --> 01:24:01.630
<v Speaker 6>You know that decision down there like </v>
<v Speaker 6>in Brazil.</v>

2074
01:24:01.810 --> 01:24:02.710
<v Speaker 6>That's scary,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bro.</v>

2075
01:24:02.711 --> 01:24:03.220
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're like,</v>

2076
01:24:03.250 --> 01:24:04.270
<v Speaker 6>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is he going to get.</v>

2077
01:24:04.950 --> 01:24:06.850
<v Speaker 7>Watch that again?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because I thought that Machita one,</v>

2078
01:24:06.940 --> 01:24:10.480
<v Speaker 7>I would have to see it again.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He got the decision,</v>

2079
01:24:10.481 --> 01:24:11.860
<v Speaker 7>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's not a robbery.</v>

2080
01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:13.660
<v Speaker 7>You know that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a close fight.</v>

2081
01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:16.750
<v Speaker 7>The problem with the Hendrix GSP fight </v>
<v Speaker 7>is like,</v>

2082
01:24:16.751 --> 01:24:21.751
<v Speaker 7>let's say people that are watching it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that our mma fans that may not even </v>

2083
01:24:21.751 --> 01:24:21.751
<v Speaker 7>train,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they just enjoy the,</v>

2084
01:24:21.751 --> 01:24:21.810
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

2085
01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:22.900
<v Speaker 7>the fights,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the joy,</v>

2086
01:24:22.901 --> 01:24:25.240
<v Speaker 7>the excitement,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the sport to them.</v>

2087
01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:29.710
<v Speaker 7>GSP got his ass kicked for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's pretty God damn obvious.</v>

2088
01:24:29.890 --> 01:24:34.890
<v Speaker 7>So the only way he didn't get his ass </v>
<v Speaker 7>kicked as if the scoring systems broken </v>

2089
01:24:34.890 --> 01:24:37.270
<v Speaker 7>because to the average person,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when you hear what is a fight about is a</v>

2090
01:24:37.271 --> 01:24:42.271
<v Speaker 7>fight about touching a guy is a fight </v>
<v Speaker 7>about putting a guy on his back and </v>

2091
01:24:42.271 --> 01:24:42.970
<v Speaker 7>winding up on top of them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What is a fight about?</v>

2092
01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:47.320
<v Speaker 7>A fight is about doing damage one way or</v>
<v Speaker 7>another or trying to finish the fight.</v>

2093
01:24:47.321 --> 01:24:50.770
<v Speaker 7>And one guy clearly did that weigh more </v>
<v Speaker 7>than the other for sure.</v>

2094
01:24:50.771 --> 01:24:52.200
<v Speaker 7>If you didn't have a scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If we're on the</v>

2095
01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:55.580
<v Speaker 6>we're on the street and that fight was </v>
<v Speaker 6>to go down and then you know,</v>

2096
01:24:55.670 --> 01:25:00.670
<v Speaker 6>after awhile everybody breaks it up and </v>
<v Speaker 6>no matter who's on top of whatever </v>

2097
01:25:00.670 --> 01:25:01.250
<v Speaker 6>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 6>big fight,</v>

2098
01:25:01.251 --> 01:25:02.030
<v Speaker 6>we stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Johnny,</v>

2099
01:25:02.031 --> 01:25:04.070
<v Speaker 6>we stand up just and we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

2100
01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:05.480
<v Speaker 6>we'll give that one to johnny on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>street.</v>

2101
01:25:05.650 --> 01:25:09.010
<v Speaker 7>But also that could.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That could be.</v>

2102
01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:14.040
<v Speaker 7>That could happen accidentally.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Someone could hit somebody with an </v>

2103
01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:16.231
<v Speaker 7>elbow,</v>
<v Speaker 7>cut them open real early in the fight </v>

2104
01:25:16.231 --> 01:25:16.231
<v Speaker 7>and even though they dominated the rest </v>
<v Speaker 7>of the round,</v>

2105
01:25:16.231 --> 01:25:18.020
<v Speaker 7>they looked the worst for rare.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's fine.</v>

2106
01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:18.710
<v Speaker 6>True,</v>
<v Speaker 6>true.</v>

2107
01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:19.580
<v Speaker 6>You gotTa,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you gotTa take,</v>

2108
01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:21.370
<v Speaker 6>take in hand,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like what actually went down,</v>

2109
01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:23.840
<v Speaker 6>like how was he doing that damage?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What was he doing?</v>

2110
01:25:23.841 --> 01:25:26.090
<v Speaker 6>And it looked like johnny was actually </v>
<v Speaker 6>doing the damage,</v>

2111
01:25:26.091 --> 01:25:27.020
<v Speaker 6>not just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2112
01:25:27.021 --> 01:25:29.000
<v Speaker 6>he got a lucky punch and as I got </v>
<v Speaker 6>swollen,</v>

2113
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:30.290
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that that could easily happen,</v>

2114
01:25:30.291 --> 01:25:32.750
<v Speaker 6>but he would just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was landing shot after shot,</v>

2115
01:25:32.751 --> 01:25:34.280
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and put it pushing a good,</v>

2116
01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:37.660
<v Speaker 6>a good pace where GSP was even wobbled </v>
<v Speaker 6>and he's just laying on him.</v>

2117
01:25:37.661 --> 01:25:39.830
<v Speaker 6>So I mean obviously you think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2118
01:25:39.831 --> 01:25:42.560
<v Speaker 6>if anybody was not even like a fan or </v>
<v Speaker 6>like your grandma was watching,</v>

2119
01:25:42.561 --> 01:25:43.290
<v Speaker 6>she'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

2120
01:25:43.291 --> 01:25:44.300
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think this guy's winning</v>

2121
01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:48.430
<v Speaker 7>the most shocked and disappointed guy I </v>
<v Speaker 7>think maybe I've ever seen after a fight</v>

2122
01:25:48.431 --> 01:25:51.560
<v Speaker 7>with Johny Hendricks Saturday night he </v>
<v Speaker 7>was Eddie Bravo.</v>

2123
01:25:51.770 --> 01:25:52.900
<v Speaker 7>Breathe in.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's crazy.</v>

2124
01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:55.720
<v Speaker 7>He's going to sleep so good tonight.</v>

2125
01:25:58.770 --> 01:26:03.770
<v Speaker 6>Earlier when it echoed and you got mad </v>
<v Speaker 6>because I was going to echo his </v>

2126
01:26:03.770 --> 01:26:03.830
<v Speaker 6>breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Make an echo.</v>

2127
01:26:03.831 --> 01:26:04.070
<v Speaker 6>So</v>

2128
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:06.620
<v Speaker 7>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's ridiculous.</v>

2129
01:26:06.910 --> 01:26:09.680
<v Speaker 7>He accidentally talked and then Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you fucked it up.</v>

2130
01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:11.900
<v Speaker 7>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2131
01:26:12.230 --> 01:26:13.460
<v Speaker 7>yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that,</v>

2132
01:26:13.461 --> 01:26:14.180
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you,</v>

2133
01:26:14.181 --> 01:26:16.190
<v Speaker 7>if,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you look at the scoring system that's</v>

2134
01:26:16.191 --> 01:26:18.410
<v Speaker 7>in place and how it's been utilized so </v>
<v Speaker 7>far,</v>

2135
01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:21.230
<v Speaker 7>I could see the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't agree with it,</v>

2136
01:26:21.231 --> 01:26:23.330
<v Speaker 7>but I could see the argument that GSP </v>
<v Speaker 7>won the fight.</v>

2137
01:26:23.570 --> 01:26:28.570
<v Speaker 7>I don't think he won the first round.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everybody was thinking that he won the </v>

2138
01:26:28.570 --> 01:26:29.480
<v Speaker 7>first round because he went for the </v>
<v Speaker 7>submission and got the take down.</v>

2139
01:26:29.481 --> 01:26:34.481
<v Speaker 7>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Johnny did a lot of damage in that </v>

2140
01:26:34.481 --> 01:26:37.130
<v Speaker 7>round,</v>
<v Speaker 7>fucked his legs up with those needs to </v>

2141
01:26:37.130 --> 01:26:39.341
<v Speaker 7>the legs,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which I don't understand why people </v>

2142
01:26:39.341 --> 01:26:39.341
<v Speaker 7>don't count those.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

2143
01:26:39.341 --> 01:26:39.710
<v Speaker 7>are you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what are you looking at?</v>

2144
01:26:39.711 --> 01:26:41.210
<v Speaker 7>The big strike.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's like a Charlie horse.</v>

2145
01:26:41.211 --> 01:26:46.211
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if you guys have been hit </v>
<v Speaker 7>in the leg or like you look at like a </v>

2146
01:26:46.211 --> 01:26:46.211
<v Speaker 7>one of those slug bugs and somebody hit </v>
<v Speaker 7>you.</v>

2147
01:26:46.211 --> 01:26:46.211
<v Speaker 7>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>

2148
01:26:46.211 --> 01:26:47.450
<v Speaker 7>that's a knee hitting you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a lot harder.</v>

2149
01:26:47.470 --> 01:26:51.140
<v Speaker 7>Just because GSP is not responding </v>
<v Speaker 7>doesn't mean those are big shots.</v>

2150
01:26:51.170 --> 01:26:53.810
<v Speaker 7>He can tolerate the pain.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was hard like fuck.</v>

2151
01:26:54.020 --> 01:26:56.240
<v Speaker 7>And those are damaging.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They take away your spraying.</v>

2152
01:26:56.450 --> 01:27:01.450
<v Speaker 7>And so in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you've got people that should not be </v>

2153
01:27:01.450 --> 01:27:05.650
<v Speaker 7>judging that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that don't understand what exactly is </v>

2154
01:27:05.650 --> 01:27:08.621
<v Speaker 7>going down.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Johnny did a lot more damage in that </v>

2155
01:27:08.621 --> 01:27:08.840
<v Speaker 7>route.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He hit him with some hard fucking elbows</v>

2156
01:27:08.841 --> 01:27:12.020
<v Speaker 7>when they were up against the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But George is trying to take him down.</v>

2157
01:27:12.021 --> 01:27:17.021
<v Speaker 7>He had the single johnny hit him with </v>
<v Speaker 7>some hard fucking elbows and then when </v>

2158
01:27:17.021 --> 01:27:20.741
<v Speaker 7>they were in the clench and johnny was </v>
<v Speaker 7>when Johnny was bouncing up and down on </v>

2159
01:27:20.741 --> 01:27:21.920
<v Speaker 7>one leg,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he was tagging him with left upper cuts.</v>

2160
01:27:22.130 --> 01:27:25.500
<v Speaker 7>Those are all really significant.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The big,</v>

2161
01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:28.130
<v Speaker 7>the takedown in this submission attempt.</v>

2162
01:27:28.490 --> 01:27:33.490
<v Speaker 7>It wasn't close enough.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It wasn't like Johnny was screaming and </v>

2163
01:27:33.490 --> 01:27:34.340
<v Speaker 7>beet red and and then he got it out of </v>
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>

2164
01:27:34.341 --> 01:27:36.680
<v Speaker 7>Like you see him on his back and his dad</v>
<v Speaker 7>strangled.</v>

2165
01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:39.830
<v Speaker 7>It wasn't close enough in my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I gave,</v>

2166
01:27:39.890 --> 01:27:41.950
<v Speaker 7>I gave Hendrix that round and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

2167
01:27:42.070 --> 01:27:43.170
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when I watch it,</v>

2168
01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:48.280
<v Speaker 7>when I'm doing commentary and I watched </v>
<v Speaker 7>as one thing when I watched it again </v>

2169
01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:51.940
<v Speaker 7>afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's when I get a sense of what I </v>

2170
01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:51.940
<v Speaker 7>think actually happened.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Didn't happen.</v>

2171
01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:53.660
<v Speaker 7>Sometimes you're doing commentary,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just trying to be entertaining.</v>

2172
01:27:53.810 --> 01:27:56.300
<v Speaker 7>You're all caught up in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but why?</v>

2173
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:58.430
<v Speaker 7>Why do you suppose nothing has been </v>
<v Speaker 7>done?</v>

2174
01:27:58.431 --> 01:28:03.431
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this isn't the first time we've had a </v>

2175
01:28:03.431 --> 01:28:03.590
<v Speaker 7>main event and in controversial </v>
<v Speaker 7>decision,</v>

2176
01:28:03.591 --> 01:28:04.570
<v Speaker 7>like why?</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

2177
01:28:06.170 --> 01:28:08.570
<v Speaker 7>because the athletic commission has to </v>
<v Speaker 7>admit that they made a mistake.</v>

2178
01:28:08.930 --> 01:28:12.260
<v Speaker 7>Do you believe the theory that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like you really should be the champion?</v>

2179
01:28:12.380 --> 01:28:13.010
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

2180
01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:15.080
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because there's a lot of those ones with</v>

2181
01:28:15.081 --> 01:28:16.190
<v Speaker 7>like Frankie Edgar,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Benson,</v>

2182
01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:17.450
<v Speaker 7>Henderson.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I tell them,</v>

2183
01:28:17.690 --> 01:28:19.640
<v Speaker 7>I think it's an even fight.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Some people are like,</v>

2184
01:28:19.670 --> 01:28:24.670
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you really got to take it from the </v>

2185
01:28:24.670 --> 01:28:24.670
<v Speaker 7>champion and be the champion.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I could see how you got to be,</v>

2186
01:28:24.670 --> 01:28:26.450
<v Speaker 7>have a look.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Any decision that's close,</v>

2187
01:28:26.451 --> 01:28:28.190
<v Speaker 7>you're going to have people that see it </v>
<v Speaker 7>for the other guy.</v>

2188
01:28:28.430 --> 01:28:30.830
<v Speaker 7>That's always going to be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And in that way,</v>

2189
01:28:30.860 --> 01:28:32.810
<v Speaker 7>the idea of you've got to take it from </v>
<v Speaker 7>the champion,</v>

2190
01:28:32.811 --> 01:28:37.811
<v Speaker 7>kind of makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the only way it makes sense to </v>

2191
01:28:37.811 --> 01:28:40.751
<v Speaker 7>convince the people that this is a fair </v>
<v Speaker 7>and just decision even if you're not </v>

2192
01:28:40.751 --> 01:28:43.190
<v Speaker 7>happy that the guy that you were rooting</v>
<v Speaker 7>for last,</v>

2193
01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:45.350
<v Speaker 7>you still have to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2194
01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:48.200
<v Speaker 7>you still have to look at it honestly </v>
<v Speaker 7>and objectively,</v>

2195
01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:51.170
<v Speaker 7>guy got his ass kicked.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the fact that you're like,</v>

2196
01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:52.580
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>here's a perfect example.</v>

2197
01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:55.190
<v Speaker 7>Second round of Frankie Edgar,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Bj Penn.</v>

2198
01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:57.680
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The first fight was a clOse fight.</v>

2199
01:28:57.710 --> 01:28:59.270
<v Speaker 7>Second fight,</v>
<v Speaker 7>second round,</v>

2200
01:28:59.271 --> 01:29:01.130
<v Speaker 7>second fight.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The first fight was a close fight,</v>

2201
01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:02.280
<v Speaker 7>whereas very debatable.</v>

2202
01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:04.710
<v Speaker 1>Second fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody was debating that cranky,</v>

2203
01:29:04.730 --> 01:29:05.210
<v Speaker 1>beat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat,</v>

2204
01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:06.720
<v Speaker 1>beat bj,</v>
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

2205
01:29:06.930 --> 01:29:11.380
<v Speaker 1>So I think when you look out worked on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was more motivated.</v>

2206
01:29:11.410 --> 01:29:13.530
<v Speaker 1>He was in beTter shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushed to hard pace.</v>

2207
01:29:13.770 --> 01:29:17.010
<v Speaker 1>That's a fight where bj penn has fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of fans.</v>

2208
01:29:17.011 --> 01:29:19.320
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't deny the fact that bj lost</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fight.</v>

2209
01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:21.030
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in that kind of fight,</v>

2210
01:29:21.031 --> 01:29:26.031
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see that's one of those fights </v>

2211
01:29:26.031 --> 01:29:26.031
<v Speaker 1>where you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2212
01:29:26.031 --> 01:29:28.580
<v Speaker 1>you're really taking it to them even </v>
<v Speaker 1>though frankie was the champion at that </v>

2213
01:29:28.580 --> 01:29:29.010
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that you should start even.</v>

2214
01:29:29.370 --> 01:29:31.170
<v Speaker 1>You should start even for sure.</v>

2215
01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:32.460
<v Speaker 6>You got it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got to earn it.</v>

2216
01:29:32.461 --> 01:29:33.420
<v Speaker 6>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think,</v>

2217
01:29:33.630 --> 01:29:36.570
<v Speaker 6>I think even gsps face a face like a </v>
<v Speaker 6>told,</v>

2218
01:29:36.630 --> 01:29:38.100
<v Speaker 6>told it all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2219
01:29:38.101 --> 01:29:39.360
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's crazy.</v>

2220
01:29:39.361 --> 01:29:40.070
<v Speaker 6>You know that actually,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2221
01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:45.080
<v Speaker 6>one of our buddies,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mike Chandler just fought eddie alvarez </v>

2222
01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:45.310
<v Speaker 6>and a sick fight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>saw that fight and it was just crazy.</v>

2223
01:29:45.330 --> 01:29:47.390
<v Speaker 6>Mike waS this going forward?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's laying in takedowns,</v>

2224
01:29:47.430 --> 01:29:48.610
<v Speaker 6>he's getting out of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2225
01:29:48.611 --> 01:29:53.611
<v Speaker 6>and he just controlling these rounds and</v>
<v Speaker 6>then such a close decision where at the </v>

2226
01:29:53.611 --> 01:29:53.760
<v Speaker 6>end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you look at this,</v>

2227
01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:56.540
<v Speaker 6>eddie alvarez is family,</v>
<v Speaker 6>looks worried they're not hugging.</v>

2228
01:29:56.910 --> 01:29:59.160
<v Speaker 6>And Michael Chandler is families like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

2229
01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:00.870
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're thinking confident,</v>

2230
01:30:00.871 --> 01:30:02.430
<v Speaker 6>but then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's this decision.</v>

2231
01:30:02.431 --> 01:30:03.300
<v Speaker 6>You're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whoa.</v>

2232
01:30:03.810 --> 01:30:05.460
<v Speaker 6>You got to go back and look at things </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2233
01:30:05.461 --> 01:30:06.110
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well what,</v>

2234
01:30:06.111 --> 01:30:08.630
<v Speaker 6>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe something I didn't see my bias,</v>

2235
01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:09.950
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just those,</v>

2236
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:11.670
<v Speaker 6>those crazy fights,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2237
01:30:11.930 --> 01:30:13.490
<v Speaker 1>I need to watch that fight a second </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2238
01:30:13.491 --> 01:30:15.170
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed it though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a wild fight.</v>

2239
01:30:15.380 --> 01:30:17.080
<v Speaker 1>Chandler is a bad motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

2240
01:30:17.130 --> 01:30:19.430
<v Speaker 1>He's a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost like that in the gym.</v>

2241
01:30:19.431 --> 01:30:19.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was awful.</v>

2242
01:30:20.010 --> 01:30:21.930
<v Speaker 5>So you think nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nothing changes.</v>

2243
01:30:21.931 --> 01:30:24.960
<v Speaker 5>Because then that would mean the </v>
<v Speaker 5>commission would have to admit they made</v>

2244
01:30:24.961 --> 01:30:25.580
<v Speaker 5>a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2245
01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:26.930
<v Speaker 1>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you change things,</v>

2246
01:30:26.931 --> 01:30:28.850
<v Speaker 1>you have to admit that you should have </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed things.</v>

2247
01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:30.740
<v Speaker 1>I have To admit that if you are running </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

2248
01:30:30.741 --> 01:30:33.860
<v Speaker 1>if this is the correct way to do things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why didn't you do this 18 months ago?</v>

2249
01:30:33.861 --> 01:30:36.530
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't you do this two years ago?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't you do this five years ago?</v>

2250
01:30:36.770 --> 01:30:41.770
<v Speaker 1>You've been licensing nma for so long </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people have been complaining about </v>

2251
01:30:41.770 --> 01:30:42.100
<v Speaker 1>things for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've.</v>

2252
01:30:42.101 --> 01:30:44.090
<v Speaker 1>You've done the same shit over and over </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

2253
01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:46.190
<v Speaker 1>That's so then that's probably never </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to change.</v>

2254
01:30:46.870 --> 01:30:51.870
<v Speaker 1>That's like the definition of insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doing the same thing over and over </v>

2255
01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:51.870
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expecting different results.</v>

2256
01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:55.160
<v Speaker 1>They can have people that are untrained </v>
<v Speaker 1>as judges</v>

2257
01:30:55.430 --> 01:31:00.430
<v Speaker 5>better or worse for the the casinos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the people that are taken.</v>

2258
01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:06.760
<v Speaker 5>Is it better or worse if there is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>logical reasonable scoring system or if </v>

2259
01:31:07.101 --> 01:31:08.930
<v Speaker 5>there's a fucked up one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's better?</v>

2260
01:31:09.410 --> 01:31:10.340
<v Speaker 5>What do you think is better for them?</v>

2261
01:31:10.490 --> 01:31:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this,</v>

2262
01:31:11.090 --> 01:31:16.090
<v Speaker 1>if the kids see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knows are on the board in everything is </v>

2263
01:31:16.090 --> 01:31:19.541
<v Speaker 1>on the square than you know the house is</v>
<v Speaker 1>always going to win and almost every </v>

2264
01:31:19.541 --> 01:31:22.100
<v Speaker 1>game right when it comes to gambling on </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights,</v>

2265
01:31:22.490 --> 01:31:27.490
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they get really good odds </v>

2266
01:31:27.490 --> 01:31:29.981
<v Speaker 1>makers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a few lines that I didn't </v>

2267
01:31:29.981 --> 01:31:32.051
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gave a few of my friends that were </v>

2268
01:31:32.051 --> 01:31:33.911
<v Speaker 1>betting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told them what I thought were like </v>

2269
01:31:33.911 --> 01:31:35.230
<v Speaker 1>good bats and not good bets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that ultimately the experts </v>

2270
01:31:35.241 --> 01:31:37.700
<v Speaker 1>of mma are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not gonna be able to fool them.</v>

2271
01:31:38.090 --> 01:31:41.300
<v Speaker 1>They know who's going to win or they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a 70,</v>

2272
01:31:41.301 --> 01:31:44.510
<v Speaker 1>80 percent chance that who's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>way better than 51 percent.</v>

2273
01:31:44.660 --> 01:31:47.720
<v Speaker 1>If the house is a 51 percent chance or </v>
<v Speaker 1>54 percent,</v>

2274
01:31:47.721 --> 01:31:51.890
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is in blackjack and mma </v>
<v Speaker 1>expert has a way better.</v>

2275
01:31:52.070 --> 01:31:53.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're gambling,</v>

2276
01:31:53.241 --> 01:31:55.050
<v Speaker 1>like if you were gambling on fines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

2277
01:31:55.070 --> 01:32:00.070
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be 80 percent right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think about 80 percent when you </v>

2278
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.070
<v Speaker 1>guess</v>

2279
01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:02.220
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I get them all wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let.</v>

2280
01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:07.240
<v Speaker 2>Let'S.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think there's ever been a point </v>

2281
01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:09.760
<v Speaker 2>in time in las vegas where they see the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are running the casinos,</v>

2282
01:32:09.761 --> 01:32:14.761
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck knows who they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have something to do with the </v>

2283
01:32:14.761 --> 01:32:17.680
<v Speaker 2>commission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're tied in somehow and uh,</v>

2284
01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.560
<v Speaker 2>at there was a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you thiNk ever that the,</v>

2285
01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:26.760
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the casinos made a decision happened </v>

2286
01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:27.040
<v Speaker 2>because they didn't want to lose a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of money?</v>

2287
01:32:27.041 --> 01:32:28.420
<v Speaker 2>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all speculation.</v>

2288
01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:31.180
<v Speaker 2>Who knows if that ever happens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2289
01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:33.940
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One thing I do know about casinos,</v>

2290
01:32:33.941 --> 01:32:37.690
<v Speaker 2>like they're not stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They catch people counting cards.</v>

2291
01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:40.300
<v Speaker 2>They get rid of them if they catch </v>
<v Speaker 2>people doing things.</v>

2292
01:32:40.301 --> 01:32:43.090
<v Speaker 2>Like here's a perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>professional pool.</v>

2293
01:32:43.210 --> 01:32:45.160
<v Speaker 2>They've never had a line on professional</v>
<v Speaker 2>pool.</v>

2294
01:32:45.161 --> 01:32:50.161
<v Speaker 2>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they had a line on professional </v>

2295
01:32:50.161 --> 01:32:52.531
<v Speaker 2>pool wants and the underdog was this </v>
<v Speaker 2>dude named mike lebraun to win this big </v>

2296
01:32:52.531 --> 01:32:56.941
<v Speaker 2>tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they dumped the shit out of this </v>

2297
01:32:56.941 --> 01:32:56.941
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody dumped to the dude,</v>

2298
01:32:56.941 --> 01:33:01.500
<v Speaker 2>meaning everybody quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They played shitty on purpose and let </v>

2299
01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:03.160
<v Speaker 2>this dude when and they get all their </v>
<v Speaker 2>money on this guy winning.</v>

2300
01:33:03.370 --> 01:33:07.210
<v Speaker 2>So everybody just had his just driving </v>
<v Speaker 2>balls straight into the rail.</v>

2301
01:33:07.211 --> 01:33:09.580
<v Speaker 2>They're missing the pocket book inches </v>
<v Speaker 2>on purpose,</v>

2302
01:33:09.730 --> 01:33:12.970
<v Speaker 2>totally on purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously on purpose and the other one</v>

2303
01:33:13.010 --> 01:33:16.070
<v Speaker 3>dude casino,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's trial and error and those,</v>

2304
01:33:16.100 --> 01:33:16.850
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>

2305
01:33:16.970 --> 01:33:21.970
<v Speaker 3>you can't actually denied a casino.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like the people that are out </v>

2306
01:33:22.100 --> 01:33:27.100
<v Speaker 3>there that are highly elite people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know how to make good decisions no </v>

2307
01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:28.490
<v Speaker 3>matter what it is that they're winning </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a reason.</v>

2308
01:33:28.491 --> 01:33:33.491
<v Speaker 3>That's because they're making good </v>
<v Speaker 3>decisions and taking advantage of those </v>

2309
01:33:33.491 --> 01:33:33.491
<v Speaker 3>people that are trying to cut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cut this.</v>

2310
01:33:33.491 --> 01:33:36.480
<v Speaker 2>Do you think there might be a crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy where like the people running</v>

2311
01:33:36.481 --> 01:33:41.481
<v Speaker 2>the casinos have something to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like every now and then they make the </v>

2312
01:33:41.481 --> 01:33:41.910
<v Speaker 2>call and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that motherfucker loss no matter what.</v>

2313
01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:47.000
<v Speaker 2>If it's close,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think there's anything like that or </v>

2314
01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.930
<v Speaker 2>you go to the casino,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they play their odds.</v>

2315
01:33:48.931 --> 01:33:51.780
<v Speaker 2>Very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone always making for some,</v>

2316
01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:56.900
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a judge to get paid off to do this </v>

2317
01:33:56.900 --> 01:33:56.900
<v Speaker 2>or that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's got to be someone with power.</v>

2318
01:33:56.900 --> 01:33:58.220
<v Speaker 3>It's the math that people don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand.</v>

2319
01:33:58.221 --> 01:33:59.960
<v Speaker 3>That's why those people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>counting cards,</v>

2320
01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:05.140
<v Speaker 3>they understand a portion of the math.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to think those people are at an </v>

2321
01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:08.471
<v Speaker 3>elite level and are always winning </v>
<v Speaker 3>Because of their decision making so </v>

2322
01:34:08.471 --> 01:34:11.591
<v Speaker 3>their.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their science and their math skills are </v>

2323
01:34:11.591 --> 01:34:13.490
<v Speaker 3>way better than you are so they can see </v>
<v Speaker 3>these small little snakes in the grass.</v>

2324
01:34:13.491 --> 01:34:18.491
<v Speaker 3>If that's what you want to call them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like dirt bag trying to scheme on your </v>

2325
01:34:18.491 --> 01:34:18.491
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if like that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>over here playing a little game.</v>

2331
01:34:27.380 --> 01:34:29.420
<v Speaker 3>He caught onto the science of the math.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2332
01:34:29.421 --> 01:34:30.680
<v Speaker 3>How crazy is that?</v>

<v Speaker 2>card counters in the casinos.</v>

01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:22.841
<v Speaker 7>ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's a lot of those guys that are </v>

<v Speaker 6>funded.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Are they just playing in a basement </v>

2359
01:35:27.381 --> 01:35:29.031
<v Speaker 6>where these dudes come from?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's crazy because they just see this </v>

<v Speaker 7>Felt like they're going over the moves.</v>

2376
01:36:05.591 --> 01:36:05.950
<v Speaker 7>They're like,</v>

<v Speaker 6>like a black jack table and then that </v>
<v Speaker 6>person's always hitting when they </v>

2385
01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:25.790
<v Speaker 6>shouldn't be hitting or not hitting and </v>

<v Speaker 6>just hitting in your role and you're </v>

2389
01:36:34.881 --> 01:36:37.581
<v Speaker 6>slapping high fives with some person </v>

<v Speaker 7>said he hits.</v>

2396
01:36:47.591 --> 01:36:50.990
<v Speaker 7>He's a hiT me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I got this is a fucking bitch.</v>

2397
01:36:51.150 --> 01:36:54.630
<v Speaker 6>Say I have like a low car,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I'm at like a nine and he's hitting</v>

2398
01:36:54.631 --> 01:36:57.690
<v Speaker 6>on a 16 to try to get to 21 because he </v>
<v Speaker 6>wants to beat the guy.</v>

2399
01:36:57.691 --> 01:36:59.990
<v Speaker 6>You know you're supposed to let that </v>
<v Speaker 6>just pass and let let,</v>

2400
01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.120
<v Speaker 6>let me go ahead and hit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hit and hit the bigger number instead.</v>

2401
01:37:03.150 --> 01:37:05.670
<v Speaker 6>He'll bust and ruined my car.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Next thing you know,</v>

2402
01:37:05.671 --> 01:37:07.560
<v Speaker 6>like all hit like two little cards and </v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like okay,</v>

2403
01:37:07.561 --> 01:37:10.290
<v Speaker 6>I'm at like a a 12,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're showing like a 15,</v>

2404
01:37:10.291 --> 01:37:12.840
<v Speaker 6>16 to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got a hit and then boom I,</v>

2405
01:37:12.841 --> 01:37:14.730
<v Speaker 6>boston,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it just kind of just goes down the line.</v>

2406
01:37:14.731 --> 01:37:17.400
<v Speaker 6>But if you get the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 6>hitting on the right cars,</v>

2407
01:37:17.401 --> 01:37:19.530
<v Speaker 6>that'll actually funkshway and flow</v>

2408
01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:21.600
<v Speaker 7>really.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

2409
01:37:21.601 --> 01:37:24.360
<v Speaker 7>It seems like he's making his decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're making your decisions.</v>

2410
01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:30.430
<v Speaker 6>Commercials.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The guy goes downstairs and they score </v>

2411
01:37:30.430 --> 01:37:30.430
<v Speaker 6>scoring.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Know</v>

2412
01:37:30.430 --> 01:37:31.010
<v Speaker 7>dante using like five decks now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're like five days.</v>

2413
01:37:31.130 --> 01:37:32.810
<v Speaker 6>I don't even know how many they use.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They use a Bunch.</v>

2414
01:37:32.830 --> 01:37:37.830
<v Speaker 6>You,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they have that big machine that like </v>

2415
01:37:37.830 --> 01:37:37.830
<v Speaker 6>just like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So</v>

2416
01:37:37.830 --> 01:37:39.960
<v Speaker 7>the way you're looking at it as if he </v>
<v Speaker 7>gets a five that you could have used and</v>

2417
01:37:39.961 --> 01:37:42.530
<v Speaker 7>he busts because that five he fucked </v>
<v Speaker 7>you.</v>

2418
01:37:42.810 --> 01:37:45.540
<v Speaker 7>You have had that five and you would </v>
<v Speaker 7>have had 20 or something.</v>

2419
01:37:45.590 --> 01:37:46.250
<v Speaker 6>YeP.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he would.</v>

2420
01:37:46.251 --> 01:37:48.650
<v Speaker 6>And he might've been.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then the dealer might have busted and he</v>

2421
01:37:48.651 --> 01:37:50.910
<v Speaker 6>could actually one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he actually hit the wrong card.</v>

2422
01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:52.160
<v Speaker 6>Trying to be greedy too soon.</v>

2423
01:37:52.260 --> 01:37:55.050
<v Speaker 7>I think that's not a good way of looking</v>
<v Speaker 7>at it.</v>

2424
01:37:55.610 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 7>I think</v>

2425
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:58.980
<v Speaker 1>that's like a defeatist logic because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't make any sense.</v>

2426
01:37:59.220 --> 01:38:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Like you look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the numbers are the numbers.</v>

2427
01:38:01.411 --> 01:38:03.450
<v Speaker 1>If you have 15 and you hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2428
01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:06.960
<v Speaker 1>you know what the consequences are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have 17 and you hit your crazy,</v>

2429
01:38:07.050 --> 01:38:12.050
<v Speaker 4>there's some good ones that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>supposed to hit on and that they tell </v>

2430
01:38:12.050 --> 01:38:12.640
<v Speaker 4>you not to hit on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And sometimes the dealer if you'd like,</v>

2431
01:38:12.641 --> 01:38:17.641
<v Speaker 4>you don't really know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're just starting out and they'll be </v>

2432
01:38:17.641 --> 01:38:17.641
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you sure you want to do that?</v>

2433
01:38:17.641 --> 01:38:21.510
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they can't tell you but they'll ask </v>

2434
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:21.510
<v Speaker 4>you and stop you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which is pretty cool because I.</v>

2435
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:25.101
<v Speaker 4>What if you don't know you're doing just</v>
<v Speaker 4>blacked out drunk and you're making all </v>

2436
01:38:25.101 --> 01:38:25.101
<v Speaker 4>stupid bets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Solution money.</v>

2437
01:38:25.101 --> 01:38:26.560
<v Speaker 1>Well I would imagine too that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>a card counter,</v>

2438
01:38:26.561 --> 01:38:31.561
<v Speaker 1>it would actually help you to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's betting all fucking wacky </v>

2439
01:38:31.561 --> 01:38:33.850
<v Speaker 1>next to you because you know that he got</v>
<v Speaker 1>that certain card,</v>

2440
01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:37.540
<v Speaker 1>like key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of like him folding or holding,</v>

2441
01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:42.120
<v Speaker 1>he actually added additional information</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the equation he gave you like,</v>

2442
01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:43.630
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the seven just got used,</v>

2443
01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:46.030
<v Speaker 1>so now you have an extra number that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can eliminate.</v>

2444
01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:47.220
<v Speaker 1>You know whaT I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2445
01:38:47.230 --> 01:38:52.230
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that playing with idiots </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be beneficial if you have the </v>

2446
01:38:52.230 --> 01:38:52.540
<v Speaker 1>right attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could possibly work out.</v>

2447
01:38:52.541 --> 01:38:53.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess if you're a card counter,</v>

2448
01:38:54.010 --> 01:38:55.930
<v Speaker 1>if you're a really good card counting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

2449
01:38:55.931 --> 01:38:57.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand how the fuck card </v>
<v Speaker 1>county works,</v>

2450
01:38:57.941 --> 01:38:58.430
<v Speaker 1>so I'm just talking.</v>

2451
01:38:58.670 --> 01:39:00.490
<v Speaker 4>There's a movie about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I still never.</v>

2452
01:39:00.570 --> 01:39:03.380
<v Speaker 4>It's hard math and math.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ed norton,</v>

2453
01:39:03.410 --> 01:39:04.130
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2454
01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:07.050
<v Speaker 4>It's a crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a crazy math to it that.</v>

2455
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.940
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2456
01:39:08.990 --> 01:39:10.050
<v Speaker 4>I think it was a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2457
01:39:10.051 --> 01:39:12.830
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a rob the casino.</v>

2458
01:39:13.070 --> 01:39:18.070
<v Speaker 4>They robbed the casino.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was there a card counter in those </v>

2459
01:39:18.070 --> 01:39:18.070
<v Speaker 4>movies?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now?</v>

2460
01:39:18.070 --> 01:39:19.470
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of others.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of those.</v>

2461
01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:20.900
<v Speaker 1>Louise,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Whether the movie wasn't with a bunch of</v>

2463
01:39:27.261 --> 01:39:28.200
<v Speaker 1>genius card counters.</v>

2464
01:39:28.350 --> 01:39:33.350
<v Speaker 4>Does the college that they would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then the guy takes him there and he </v>

2465
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.390
<v Speaker 4>wasn't supposed to Be in the building.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2466
01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:36.420
<v Speaker 4>you guys want to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They all got a suite together.</v>

2467
01:39:36.421 --> 01:39:38.350
<v Speaker 4>They're rolling around in cash and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>all goes bad.</v>

2468
01:39:38.430 --> 01:39:43.430
<v Speaker 4>Eddie bravo cards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would you rob the system where if you,</v>

2469
01:39:45.090 --> 01:39:50.090
<v Speaker 4>if you do a little bit like say you knew</v>
<v Speaker 4>the math and you just sit down and </v>

2470
01:39:50.090 --> 01:39:50.090
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what else?</v>

2471
01:39:50.090 --> 01:39:50.730
<v Speaker 4>I just want a couple extra hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's real quick,</v>

2472
01:39:50.731 --> 01:39:55.731
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you would you sit down and do </v>

2473
01:39:55.731 --> 01:39:55.731
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't be scared of a system.</v>

2474
01:39:55.731 --> 01:39:59.720
<v Speaker 4>But I didn't realize that I was an idiot</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was going to try to make some </v>

2475
01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:01.030
<v Speaker 4>money and taco and then realized,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh shit.</v>

2476
01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:02.520
<v Speaker 4>How much did you lose before you figured</v>
<v Speaker 4>ouT?</v>

2477
01:40:03.170 --> 01:40:07.500
<v Speaker 4>Well it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like 21 and roulette.</v>

2478
01:40:08.140 --> 01:40:10.050
<v Speaker 4>There'S reddit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can just bet red and black.</v>

2479
01:40:10.051 --> 01:40:15.051
<v Speaker 4>You could put chips on the numbers or </v>
<v Speaker 4>you could just put chips on red and </v>

2480
01:40:15.051 --> 01:40:15.051
<v Speaker 4>black.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I figured,</v>

2481
01:40:15.051 --> 01:40:16.920
<v Speaker 4>I figured that if you put a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2482
01:40:17.170 --> 01:40:17.870
<v Speaker 4>if you had a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2483
01:40:17.900 --> 01:40:21.900
<v Speaker 4>I have a lot of cash to put $500 on red.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you lose,</v>

2484
01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:26.990
<v Speaker 4>you just keep putting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You keep doubling it until finally read </v>

2485
01:40:26.990 --> 01:40:31.130
<v Speaker 4>hits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you got to have a lot of money to </v>

2486
01:40:31.130 --> 01:40:31.130
<v Speaker 4>double.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's a limit.</v>

2487
01:40:31.130 --> 01:40:31.560
<v Speaker 4>So they already figured that out a long </v>
<v Speaker 4>time ago.</v>

2488
01:40:31.740 --> 01:40:33.660
<v Speaker 4>So they limit you that you can do that </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

2489
01:40:33.661 --> 01:40:38.661
<v Speaker 4>So I thought I had it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't realize that they already </v>

2490
01:40:38.661 --> 01:40:38.661
<v Speaker 4>figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm in,</v>

2491
01:40:38.661 --> 01:40:38.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just gonna.</v>

2492
01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:41.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm just gonna win once when 500 bucks </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm done.</v>

2493
01:40:41.580 --> 01:40:44.440
<v Speaker 4>That can be an expensive method though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>you better come in with some staff.</v>

2494
01:40:44.490 --> 01:40:47.830
<v Speaker 4>You've got to have like $10,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you hit that,</v>

2495
01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:49.680
<v Speaker 4>I'd be so awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like walk away.</v>

2496
01:40:49.770 --> 01:40:50.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to walk with.</v>

2497
01:40:50.990 --> 01:40:54.160
<v Speaker 4>The key is to walk away when you your </v>
<v Speaker 4>$500 back.</v>

2498
01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:57.190
<v Speaker 2>So everybody's thought this through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious.</v>

2499
01:40:58.300 --> 01:41:00.760
<v Speaker 2>How many conversations have been had </v>
<v Speaker 2>across the country?</v>

2500
01:41:00.770 --> 01:41:03.160
<v Speaker 2>People figuring bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was telling people I got it bro.</v>

2501
01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:04.930
<v Speaker 2>I got it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not going to get crazy.</v>

2502
01:41:04.990 --> 01:41:08.140
<v Speaker 2>It's just going to be $500 a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a system to get you could.</v>

2503
01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:11.370
<v Speaker 2>You could live nicely just once a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just got up.</v>

2504
01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:13.870
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want $500 a day,</v>

2505
01:41:13.871 --> 01:41:18.871
<v Speaker 2>they would fucking kick you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd be like you to keep switching </v>

2506
01:41:18.871 --> 01:41:18.871
<v Speaker 2>casinos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2684
01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:31.740
<v Speaker 2>I think I've been inspired by a shitload</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people in my life,</v>

<v Speaker 2>inspire to me that's a huge gift to be </v>

2686
01:48:36.741 --> 01:48:37.710
<v Speaker 2>able to turn that back around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2687
01:48:37.860 --> 01:48:38.700

<v Speaker 2>some way,</v>

2689
01:48:40.831 --> 01:48:43.620
<v Speaker 2>shape or form and I think doing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast is doing that,</v>

2690
01:48:43.950 --> 01:48:45.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having a podcast is like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>literally inspiration in a digital form.</v>

2692
01:48:49.110 --> 01:48:54.110
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them conversations with people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you might not ever get to sit down </v>

2709
01:49:33.421 --> 01:49:36.180

<v Speaker 2>It's gonna enhance the conversation.</v>

2710
01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:40.170
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have a nice time by </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

2711
01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:45.760
<v Speaker 2>Big bags of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people just trying to get on that </v>

2712
01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:46.950
<v Speaker 2>spiritual level and it could be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>spiritual way of just chilling.</v>

2713
01:49:47.140 --> 01:49:48.090
<v Speaker 2>Relaxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2714
01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:49.390
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a part of the earth.</v>

2715
01:49:49.420 --> 01:49:50.680
<v Speaker 4>It's a part of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>

2716
01:49:50.770 --> 01:49:53.800
<v Speaker 4>We have a relationship with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're waking up hitting the ball,</v>

2717
01:49:53.860 --> 01:49:55.420
<v Speaker 4>that's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you know what?</v>

2718
01:49:55.421 --> 01:49:57.010
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you need it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2719
01:49:57.011 --> 01:49:58.810
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying what you need or what you</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't need,</v>

2720
01:49:58.811 --> 01:50:01.150
<v Speaker 4>but if you don't need it and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking out of control,</v>

2721
01:50:01.180 --> 01:50:04.360
<v Speaker 7>then you got to deal with your shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's the out of control thing.</v>

2722
01:50:04.361 --> 01:50:07.300
<v Speaker 7>It's like a psychological balance.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And as a fighter,</v>

2723
01:50:07.301 --> 01:50:11.200
<v Speaker 7>I think you probably have the most </v>
<v Speaker 7>difficult job in all of athletics,</v>

2724
01:50:11.201 --> 01:50:12.370
<v Speaker 7>entertainment,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sports.</v>

2725
01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:15.040
<v Speaker 7>You have the most difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 7>solitary,</v>

2726
01:50:15.250 --> 01:50:16.870
<v Speaker 7>lonely,</v>
<v Speaker 7>dangerous,</v>

2727
01:50:16.871 --> 01:50:17.520
<v Speaker 7>crazy job</v>

2728
01:50:17.660 --> 01:50:22.660
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think athletes just in general have </v>

2729
01:50:22.660 --> 01:50:24.831
<v Speaker 4>that because look at the exposure that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're getting on twitter and stuff like </v>

2730
01:50:24.831 --> 01:50:24.831
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That stuff wasn't happening with Michael</v>

2731
01:50:24.831 --> 01:50:29.631
<v Speaker 4>Jordan was for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This goes back to what you're talking </v>

2732
01:50:29.631 --> 01:50:30.030
<v Speaker 4>about when people were a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 4>exClusive than because they couldn't get</v>

2733
01:50:30.031 --> 01:50:32.280
<v Speaker 4>into your day to day life as if like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2734
01:50:32.281 --> 01:50:33.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm a fan of joe rogan.</v>

2746
01:50:58.401 --> 01:51:01.130
<v Speaker 4>never hostility,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but online when you're dealing with </v>

2747
01:51:01.130 --> 01:51:04.200
<v Speaker 4>anonymous people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>horrible shit,</v>

2748
01:51:04.380 --> 01:51:06.240
<v Speaker 4>internet tough guys because that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not even.</v>

2749
01:51:06.270 --> 01:51:11.270
<v Speaker 4>They're not even,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not even a real thing they're </v>

2750
01:51:11.270 --> 01:51:11.270
<v Speaker 4>saying because they don't really mean </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2751
01:51:11.270 --> 01:51:11.670
<v Speaker 4>They would never say it if you were in </v>
<v Speaker 4>front of them,</v>

2752
01:51:12.180 --> 01:51:15.780
<v Speaker 4>fake the words have no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if those people spend half the time</v>

2753
01:51:15.781 --> 01:51:20.781
<v Speaker 4>off the internet or off their cell phone</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking so much and they use that same </v>

2754
01:51:20.781 --> 01:51:22.110
<v Speaker 4>energy that they do on this side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they go to the other side,</v>

2755
01:51:22.430 --> 01:51:23.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a much more positive.</v>

2756
01:51:23.941 --> 01:51:28.941
<v Speaker 4>How much more inspirational possibly </v>
<v Speaker 4>like how much more like ambition they </v>

2757
01:51:28.941 --> 01:51:28.941
<v Speaker 4>would have him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2758
01:51:28.941 --> 01:51:33.711
<v Speaker 4>maybe successful in that aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but some people spend that same amount </v>

2759
01:51:33.711 --> 01:51:34.440
<v Speaker 4>of energy as you would over here on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>good side.</v>

2760
01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:37.080
<v Speaker 4>Spending it on the negative side if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're able to just to turn it around.</v>

2761
01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:38.640
<v Speaker 4>It's the same effort.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2762
01:51:38.641 --> 01:51:43.350
<v Speaker 4>I learned that very early in life that </v>
<v Speaker 4>even though there's a real big pole</v>

2763
01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:48.400
<v Speaker 7>to think about other people and dwell on</v>
<v Speaker 7>other people and be angry about other </v>

2764
01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:51.500
<v Speaker 7>people and look about their success or </v>
<v Speaker 7>compare it to your success,</v>

2765
01:51:51.740 --> 01:51:56.740
<v Speaker 7>that shit is all flawed and dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 7>because it robs you of your time for </v>

2766
01:51:58.230 --> 01:52:03.230
<v Speaker 7>time you spend,</v>
<v Speaker 7>even though it feels natural to hate on </v>

2767
01:52:03.230 --> 01:52:06.791
<v Speaker 7>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that time you spend hating on someone </v>

2768
01:52:06.791 --> 01:52:09.920
<v Speaker 7>robs you of your own time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You are literally hating on yourself and</v>

2769
01:52:09.921 --> 01:52:13.010
<v Speaker 7>you don't even realize it because you're</v>
<v Speaker 7>a smart person.</v>

2770
01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:18.160
<v Speaker 7>You only have a certain amount of free </v>
<v Speaker 7>time and your fucking day because if </v>

2771
01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:19.370
<v Speaker 7>you're a smart person,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you find shit you love to do.</v>

2772
01:52:19.550 --> 01:52:21.410
<v Speaker 7>Whether it's a relationship you love to </v>
<v Speaker 7>do,</v>

2773
01:52:21.411 --> 01:52:25.010
<v Speaker 7>whether it's a sport you love to do,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whether it's a job you like to pursue,</v>

2774
01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:30.160
<v Speaker 7>you don't have much time and anytime you</v>
<v Speaker 7>spend on some nonsense and gossip and </v>

2775
01:52:30.441 --> 01:52:35.441
<v Speaker 7>stupidity,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when you see these gossipy websites and </v>

2776
01:52:35.441 --> 01:52:36.800
<v Speaker 7>people talking shit about people where </v>
<v Speaker 7>you're like,</v>

2777
01:52:36.801 --> 01:52:38.990
<v Speaker 7>why would you even write that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What are they doing?</v>

2778
01:52:38.991 --> 01:52:42.970
<v Speaker 7>They're distracting themselves from </v>
<v Speaker 7>their own failure reversals.</v>

2779
01:52:43.100 --> 01:52:48.100
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some people that ain't even on </v>

2780
01:52:48.100 --> 01:52:48.100
<v Speaker 4>that level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2781
01:52:48.100 --> 01:52:48.100
<v Speaker 4>lost a lot of friends growing,</v>

2782
01:52:48.100 --> 01:52:51.280
<v Speaker 2>growing up and getting to where I'm at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's probably a good decision </v>

2783
01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:51.410
<v Speaker 2>making.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people just don't ever get it.</v>

2784
01:52:51.650 --> 01:52:56.650
<v Speaker 2>They don't ever know how to flip that </v>
<v Speaker 2>switch and realize that it's the same </v>

2785
01:52:56.650 --> 01:52:57.650
<v Speaker 2>amount of energy that you spend doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad as the same amount that you could be</v>

2786
01:52:57.651 --> 01:53:02.651
<v Speaker 2>spending doing good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all goes to the decisions and </v>

2787
01:53:02.651 --> 01:53:02.870
<v Speaker 2>momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get on momentum.</v>

2788
01:53:02.871 --> 01:53:05.030
<v Speaker 2>They get caught up in this wave of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hating,</v>

2789
01:53:05.450 --> 01:53:08.140
<v Speaker 2>hating on people or gossiping about </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2790
01:53:08.141 --> 01:53:13.141
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about someone that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't even fucking know how many people </v>

2791
01:53:13.141 --> 01:53:15.020
<v Speaker 2>you've ever heard like talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>like reality stars on tv,</v>

2792
01:53:15.260 --> 01:53:17.380
<v Speaker 2>talking like tmz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like their job.</v>

2793
01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:19.160
<v Speaker 2>There's three types of people in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

2794
01:53:19.161 --> 01:53:19.580
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

2795
01:53:19.700 --> 01:53:21.950
<v Speaker 2>there's talkers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's watchers and there's doers.</v>

2796
01:53:22.280 --> 01:53:24.050
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if it wasn't for like people like,</v>

2797
01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:26.510
<v Speaker 2>like real famous people or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>teams,</v>

2798
01:53:26.570 --> 01:53:29.330
<v Speaker 2>people don't even have a job because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know who to go follow anymore</v>

2799
01:53:29.331 --> 01:53:29.810
<v Speaker 2>and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2800
01:53:29.811 --> 01:53:30.650
<v Speaker 2>what are they doing now?</v>

2801
01:53:30.650 --> 01:53:33.710
<v Speaker 2>Are like system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think of when I made a tmz guy that he's</v>

2802
01:53:33.711 --> 01:53:37.160
<v Speaker 2>just a cool dude and transitionary job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's My approach.</v>

2803
01:53:37.340 --> 01:53:42.340
<v Speaker 2>I like to think that right now he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking a camera in front of people's </v>

2804
01:53:42.340 --> 01:53:42.340
<v Speaker 2>faces at the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But hey man,</v>

2805
01:53:42.340 --> 01:53:42.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to make some money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2806
01:53:42.951 --> 01:53:44.540
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2808
01:53:46.101 --> 01:53:48.620
<v Speaker 2>I try not to judge anybody doing any of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit,</v>

2809
01:53:49.270 --> 01:53:51.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a job that exists.</v>

2810
01:53:51.201 --> 01:53:56.201
<v Speaker 2>It's not his fault that that job exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is there is a demand demand </v>

2811
01:53:56.201 --> 01:53:56.690
<v Speaker 2>for their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for nonsense.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm guilty as charged man,</v>

2813

<v Speaker 2>cause there was a fake video apparently </v>

01:55:21.641 --> 01:55:22.140
<v Speaker 2>life that live in a terrible </v>

2846
01:55:31.101 --> 01:55:31.780
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2847
01:55:31.781 --> 01:55:36.781
<v Speaker 2>there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a point where you grow up </v>

2848
01:55:36.781 --> 01:55:36.781
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2849
01:55:36.781 --> 01:55:36.781
<v Speaker 2>because you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't blame.</v>

2850
01:55:36.781 --> 01:55:37.820
<v Speaker 2>You can blame it on the parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there comes a point where you get to</v>

2851
01:55:37.821 --> 01:55:39.110
<v Speaker 2>a certain point where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2852
01:55:39.111 --> 01:55:41.900
<v Speaker 2>I can make a decision for myself to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>either a good choice,</v>

2853
01:55:41.901 --> 01:55:43.740
<v Speaker 2>like I don't have to live like this for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of my life.</v>

2854
01:55:43.741 --> 01:55:44.100
<v Speaker 2>I can go</v>

2855
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:49.100
<v Speaker 6>on and do this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but just the fact that you would use </v>

2856
01:55:49.100 --> 01:55:49.220
<v Speaker 6>that as an excuse,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like bad parenting and I'm going out and</v>

2857
01:55:49.221 --> 01:55:54.221
<v Speaker 6>I'm like bashing people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But granted it does start with the </v>

2858
01:55:54.221 --> 01:55:54.221
<v Speaker 6>parenting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2859
01:55:54.221 --> 01:55:54.221
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's very important.</v>

2860
01:55:54.221 --> 01:55:55.710
<v Speaker 6>I told the guys that are involved </v>
<v Speaker 6>because it's always.</v>

2861
01:55:55.850 --> 01:56:00.850
<v Speaker 6>It's one dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's like a group of five or six of </v>

2862
01:56:00.850 --> 01:56:02.420
<v Speaker 6>them in one dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just clocks this man passing by and that</v>

2863
01:56:02.421 --> 01:56:03.840
<v Speaker 6>the people in that group,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

2864
01:56:03.841 --> 01:56:06.030
<v Speaker 6>there's got to be one per group,</v>

2865
01:56:06.320 --> 01:56:11.320
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has half a heart and can call the cops </v>

2866
01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:12.740
<v Speaker 2>and report this fucking bastard before </v>
<v Speaker 2>he does it again.</v>

2867
01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:17.960
<v Speaker 2>Use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's gotta be there's gotta fuck you </v>

2868
01:56:17.960 --> 01:56:18.700
<v Speaker 2>talking about his group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we need to.</v>

2869
01:56:18.830 --> 01:56:19.380
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2870
01:56:19.390 --> 01:56:20.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2871
01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:21.400
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

2872
01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:26.500
<v Speaker 2>Or rats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rats are bad.</v>

2873
01:56:30.201 --> 01:56:34.340
<v Speaker 2>That's a good rat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah know it's incredibly cowardly move.</v>

2874
01:56:34.341 --> 01:56:37.580
<v Speaker 2>But it's also like they're looking for </v>
<v Speaker 2>some excitement in their life probably.</v>

2875
01:56:37.820 --> 01:56:42.820
<v Speaker 2>And it's exciting to do something </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible like that for all the wrong </v>

2876
01:56:42.820 --> 01:56:42.820
<v Speaker 2>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still exciting.</v>

2877
01:56:42.820 --> 01:56:44.500
<v Speaker 6>How about getting paid $100,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>to get into a gym,</v>

2878
01:56:44.501 --> 01:56:45.730
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2881
01:56:47.670 --> 01:56:51.790
<v Speaker 2>So that's the real knock say to people </v>
<v Speaker 2>when people talk to me about fighting,</v>

2882
01:56:51.791 --> 01:56:52.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

2883
01:56:52.780 --> 01:56:55.330

2886
01:56:59.350 --> 01:57:04.350

<v Speaker 2>you think fighting is kicking someone's </v>

2887
01:57:04.350 --> 01:57:05.590
<v Speaker 2>ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know that happens sometimes,</v>

2888
01:57:05.710 --> 01:57:08.770
<v Speaker 2>but it's fighting and everybody wants to</v>
<v Speaker 2>kick someone's ass,</v>

2889
01:57:08.771 --> 01:57:11.800

<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2923
01:58:21.711 --> 01:58:25.240
<v Speaker 7>there's no sport that gets closer to the</v>
<v Speaker 7>raw nature of,</v>

2924
01:58:25.241 --> 01:58:30.241
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>of a fight to the death of fight or </v>

2925
01:58:30.241 --> 01:58:30.500
<v Speaker 7>flight,</v>
<v Speaker 7>of being able to test your will,</v>

2926
01:58:30.620 --> 01:58:31.850
<v Speaker 7>your heart,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your courage.</v>

2927
01:58:31.851 --> 01:58:34.100
<v Speaker 7>You're willing to put it all on the line</v>
<v Speaker 7>against another persons.</v>

2928
01:58:34.250 --> 01:58:39.250
<v Speaker 7>And not just in that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but in all that time that you spend </v>

2929
01:58:39.250 --> 01:58:42.010
<v Speaker 7>preparing for that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the guy who was more willing,</v>

2930
01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:47.160
<v Speaker 7>that guy who was more enthused,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the guy was more disciplined and </v>

2931
01:58:47.160 --> 01:58:48.490
<v Speaker 7>smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 7>All those things have to come together.</v>

2932
01:58:49.240 --> 01:58:52.570
<v Speaker 7>And now also you're dealing also like </v>
<v Speaker 7>what we were talking about,</v>

2933
01:58:52.630 --> 01:58:55.150
<v Speaker 7>these super athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>these guys like hector lumbar,</v>

2934
01:58:55.330 --> 01:58:57.910
<v Speaker 7>these guys like tyron woodley,</v>
<v Speaker 7>thEse,</v>

2935
01:58:57.911 --> 01:59:00.310
<v Speaker 7>these guys that are coming along like </v>
<v Speaker 7>jesus christ,</v>

2936
01:59:00.620 --> 01:59:03.510
<v Speaker 4>sergio pettis to little 20 year old kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2937
01:59:03.530 --> 01:59:08.530
<v Speaker 4>you can name all those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then you gotta you gotta think here </v>

2938
01:59:08.530 --> 01:59:10.961
<v Speaker 4>before too long there's going to be some</v>
<v Speaker 4>little kid right now thAt he's going to </v>

2939
01:59:10.961 --> 01:59:11.180
<v Speaker 4>turn 18.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he'd be like,</v>

2940
01:59:11.181 --> 01:59:12.380
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what I've been training for.</v>

2941
01:59:12.381 --> 01:59:15.110
<v Speaker 4>This is what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And by the time he's 19 years old,</v>

2942
01:59:15.170 --> 01:59:19.470
<v Speaker 4>could be fighting in the ufc and be one </v>
<v Speaker 4>like tyson bad dude like tyson.</v>

2943
01:59:20.310 --> 01:59:20.780
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

2944
01:59:20.810 --> 01:59:25.390
<v Speaker 7>You remember those days we used to watch</v>
<v Speaker 7>tyson on espn and see the highlight</v>

2945
01:59:25.420 --> 01:59:30.420
<v Speaker 4>some zoos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why in a body shop to a write up or you </v>

2946
01:59:30.540 --> 01:59:32.870
<v Speaker 4>just admitted that he was on coke during</v>
<v Speaker 4>those fights?</v>

2947
01:59:32.900 --> 01:59:33.320
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2948
01:59:33.321 --> 01:59:35.150
<v Speaker 4>The later fights after prison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2949
01:59:35.151 --> 01:59:40.151
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>After three is he had like 300 million </v>

2950
01:59:40.151 --> 01:59:41.240
<v Speaker 4>people were taking advantage of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just beginner days poses.</v>

2951
01:59:42.100 --> 01:59:44.600
<v Speaker 4>It was after,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it wasn't during the ferocious days.</v>

2952
01:59:44.760 --> 01:59:49.760
<v Speaker 7>I think he was saying that it was at,</v>
<v Speaker 7>let's find out tyson had immense hooked </v>

2953
01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:49.760
<v Speaker 7>on cocaine</v>

2954
01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:51.940
<v Speaker 4>because it would make sense because if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you look at his early fights when he was</v>

2955
01:59:51.941 --> 01:59:53.920
<v Speaker 4>just destroying people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That makes sense.</v>

2956
01:59:53.921 --> 01:59:56.470
<v Speaker 4>He looks like he's on coke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he was just so,</v>

2957
01:59:56.800 --> 01:59:59.680
<v Speaker 4>so crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he had so much power in such a gift,</v>

2958
02:00:00.010 --> 02:00:01.960
<v Speaker 4>but he.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would like cry before his fights.</v>

2959
02:00:01.961 --> 02:00:02.420
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that's.</v>

2960
02:00:02.510 --> 02:00:07.510

<v Speaker 4>That's the crazy part.</v>

2962
02:00:07.510 --> 02:00:12.481
<v Speaker 4>Like normally a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what's funny is you're talking </v>

<v Speaker 4>buster douglas.</v>

3009
02:02:23.001 --> 02:02:24.500

<v Speaker 4>that's a crazy story about him.</v>

3010
02:02:24.501 --> 02:02:28.910
<v Speaker 4>His mom died like three weeks before </v>

3011
02:02:28.911 --> 02:02:33.911
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that dude's just like unlike another </v>

3012
02:02:33.911 --> 02:02:34.160
<v Speaker 4>mental level because that already he </v>
<v Speaker 4>would just been really screwed up,</v>

3013
02:02:34.161 --> 02:02:36.650
<v Speaker 4>but he obviously seemed like he was on a</v>
<v Speaker 4>whole nother level.</v>

3014
02:02:36.710 --> 02:02:38.180
<v Speaker 4>Listen to this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wrote his memoir.</v>

3015
02:02:38.330 --> 02:02:40.670
<v Speaker 4>The history of war is the history of </v>
<v Speaker 4>drugs.</v>

3016
02:02:40.910 --> 02:02:44.510
<v Speaker 4>Every great general and warrior from the</v>
<v Speaker 4>beginning of time was high.</v>

3017
02:02:45.610 --> 02:02:49.550
<v Speaker 4>Who put the rug that that's what he </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrote his memoirs.</v>

3018
02:02:49.860 --> 02:02:51.980
<v Speaker 4>And you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot to it.</v>

3019
02:02:51.981 --> 02:02:56.981
<v Speaker 4>When you find out the bushes brought in </v>
<v Speaker 4>more cooked in the state and the states </v>

3020
02:02:56.981 --> 02:03:00.191
<v Speaker 4>than any other drug cartels combined.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could you imagine if we find out that </v>

3021
02:03:00.191 --> 02:03:02.000
<v Speaker 4>the military industrial complex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a bunch of coke heads.</v>

<v Speaker 4>skies.</v>

3026
02:03:09.501 --> 02:03:11.100
<v Speaker 4>There was this old cocaine dealer </v>
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>

02:03:11.101 --> 02:03:16.101
<v Speaker 4>They'll chapo guzman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They called this guy the lord of the </v>

3028
02:03:16.101 --> 02:03:17.030
<v Speaker 4>skies and my spanish isn't that good to </v>
<v Speaker 4>even remember what it was,</v>

3029
02:03:17.031 --> 02:03:22.031
<v Speaker 4>but this guy was one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was the richest and probably no one </v>

3030
02:03:22.031 --> 02:03:22.460
<v Speaker 4>else will ever top the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the lord of the skies.</v>

3031
02:03:22.460 --> 02:03:23.120
<v Speaker 4>What he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3032
02:03:23.420 --> 02:03:27.530
<v Speaker 4>he basically bought out all the police,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the government and was paying top,</v>

3033
02:03:27.531 --> 02:03:28.520
<v Speaker 4>top dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3036
02:03:33.400 --> 02:03:37.310
<v Speaker 4>s and was using all of these resources.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's no doubt in my mind,</v>

<v Speaker 2>conversation he'd done in 10 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop and nothing wrong with tequila.</v>

3192
02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:20.720
<v Speaker 2>She's a very pretty girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe she's got some good points.</v>

3193
02:10:20.990 --> 02:10:23.950
<v Speaker 2>My point is you could get they they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

02:10:24.060 --> 02:10:26.270
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing about homeland </v>
<v Speaker 2>homelands and interesting show.</v>

3195
02:10:26.271 --> 02:10:27.860
<v Speaker 2>It's on showtime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about cia.</v>

3196
02:10:28.070 --> 02:10:29.590
<v Speaker 2>I really enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fascinating.</v>

3197
02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:30.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3198
02:10:30.771 --> 02:10:35.771
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about the cia and fighting </v>

3199
02:10:35.771 --> 02:10:35.771
<v Speaker 2>terrorism and people turning terrorists</v>

3200
02:10:35.771 --> 02:10:37.550
<v Speaker 7>and soldiers turning on the government </v>
<v Speaker 7>look good.</v>

3201
02:10:37.910 --> 02:10:38.540
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>

3202
02:10:38.541 --> 02:10:40.400
<v Speaker 7>It's a good show.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a really good show.</v>

3203
02:10:40.401 --> 02:10:45.401
<v Speaker 7>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It shows how difficult the intelligence </v>

3204
02:10:45.401 --> 02:10:46.190
<v Speaker 7>businesses though,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and it shows how much they set things up</v>

3205
02:10:46.250 --> 02:10:49.340
<v Speaker 7>and they create fake stories and they </v>
<v Speaker 7>released fake stories to the news.</v>

3206
02:10:49.700 --> 02:10:52.020
<v Speaker 7>It's god damn fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Really.</v>

3207
02:10:52.030 --> 02:10:52.930
<v Speaker 7>That far?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3208
02:10:52.940 --> 02:10:53.360
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3209
02:10:53.361 --> 02:10:56.420
<v Speaker 7>Because when you watch It and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 7>huh,</v>

3210
02:10:56.660 --> 02:11:00.020
<v Speaker 7>I wonder what they actually do because </v>
<v Speaker 7>this is purely fiction,</v>

3211
02:11:00.290 --> 02:11:03.350
<v Speaker 7>so I wonder how much,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how much is actually going on,</v>

3212
02:11:03.500 --> 02:11:05.690
<v Speaker 7>how much is actual narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how much they create,</v>

3213
02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:10.130
<v Speaker 7>but for sure they create.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Some of it for sure,</v>

3214
02:11:10.340 --> 02:11:15.340
<v Speaker 7>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If there's some shit going on and they </v>

3215
02:11:15.340 --> 02:11:16.730
<v Speaker 7>want to cover up operation mockingbird,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's not a conspiracy theory.</v>

3216
02:11:16.760 --> 02:11:19.390
<v Speaker 7>How about operation midnight climax.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's not a conspiracy.</v>

3217
02:11:19.391 --> 02:11:19.900
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's,</v>

3218
02:11:19.930 --> 02:11:23.480
<v Speaker 7>that's a fucking real thing that they </v>
<v Speaker 7>did with the fbi.</v>

3219
02:11:23.750 --> 02:11:28.750
<v Speaker 7>Put brothels in New York and san </v>
<v Speaker 7>francisco and they got people fucked up </v>

3220
02:11:30.111 --> 02:11:35.111
<v Speaker 7>on lsd when they thought they were going</v>
<v Speaker 7>to get a hooker and then they monitored </v>

3221
02:11:35.111 --> 02:11:35.150
<v Speaker 7>them and checked,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3222
02:11:35.240 --> 02:11:36.830
<v Speaker 7>did studies on them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They,</v>

3223
02:11:36.970 --> 02:11:39.630
<v Speaker 7>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They would go in and get the dick suck.</v>

3224
02:11:40.370 --> 02:11:43.520
<v Speaker 7>I'm tired of fucking my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm tired of my life.</v>

3225
02:11:43.521 --> 02:11:46.180
<v Speaker 7>I'm tired of everything,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I scraped up 200 bucks.</v>

3226
02:11:46.200 --> 02:11:51.200
<v Speaker 7>My wife doesn't know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to sneak off this brothel and </v>

3227
02:11:51.200 --> 02:11:52.420
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to blow a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's going to be glorious and say,</v>

3228
02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:54.500
<v Speaker 7>would you like second a lot of baby </v>
<v Speaker 7>before we get started,</v>

3229
02:11:55.100 --> 02:11:57.200
<v Speaker 7>I'll tell you a glass of water that I </v>
<v Speaker 7>drink,</v>

3230
02:11:57.201 --> 02:11:59.090
<v Speaker 7>a little glass of water and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 7>sudden,</v>

3231
02:11:59.390 --> 02:12:03.050
<v Speaker 7>doo doo,</v>
<v Speaker 7>doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.</v>

3232
02:12:03.320 --> 02:12:07.520
<v Speaker 7>The fucking guys in the suits come in </v>
<v Speaker 7>with a clipboard and the big glasses and</v>

3233
02:12:07.521 --> 02:12:10.070
<v Speaker 7>they're freaking the fuck out and asking</v>
<v Speaker 7>you questions,</v>

3234
02:12:10.220 --> 02:12:11.480
<v Speaker 7>and these poor guys,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>

3235
02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:16.510
<v Speaker 7>they they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they did this for years and indeed </v>

3236
02:12:16.510 --> 02:12:19.540
<v Speaker 7>these,</v>
<v Speaker 7>these unbeknownst to them studies on </v>

3237
02:12:19.540 --> 02:12:22.811
<v Speaker 7>these dudes and it was after the </v>
<v Speaker 7>government couldn't do it anymore to </v>

3238
02:12:22.811 --> 02:12:23.240
<v Speaker 7>soldiers just like mine.</v>

3239
02:12:23.300 --> 02:12:24.740
<v Speaker 7>Mine warping them and figuring out their</v>
<v Speaker 7>mind.</v>

3240
02:12:24.860 --> 02:12:29.860
<v Speaker 7>First they were trying to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck lsd did and for a long </v>

3241
02:12:29.860 --> 02:12:32.210
<v Speaker 7>time they thought lsd when Robert </v>
<v Speaker 7>Hoffman,</v>

3242
02:12:32.270 --> 02:12:34.850
<v Speaker 7>Albert Hoffman rather,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when Albert Hoffman created lsd.</v>

3243
02:12:35.030 --> 02:12:40.030
<v Speaker 7>Once the Intelligence community found </v>
<v Speaker 7>out about this incredibly potent </v>

3244
02:12:40.030 --> 02:12:43.480
<v Speaker 7>psychedelic drug for the western world,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was one of the first psychedelics </v>

3245
02:12:43.480 --> 02:12:45.770
<v Speaker 7>have people aware of.</v>
<v Speaker 7>it wasn't until gordon watson discovered</v>

3246
02:12:45.771 --> 02:12:50.771
<v Speaker 7>the psychedelic mushroom,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that people knew that it existed in the </v>

3247
02:12:50.771 --> 02:12:51.100
<v Speaker 7>western world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The information for what have you,</v>

3248
02:12:51.101 --> 02:12:53.390
<v Speaker 7>even though there's thousands and </v>
<v Speaker 7>thousands of years of use,</v>

3249
02:12:53.391 --> 02:12:56.630
<v Speaker 7>had kind of been lost to the modern </v>
<v Speaker 7>intellectual.</v>

3250
02:12:56.840 --> 02:13:01.840
<v Speaker 7>Well aCid came along by accident.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Albert hoffman discovered acid and then </v>

3251
02:13:02.720 --> 02:13:07.720
<v Speaker 7>the government initially when they found</v>
<v Speaker 7>out about thought that it was going to </v>

3252
02:13:07.720 --> 02:13:07.720
<v Speaker 7>be a truth serum,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they thought,</v>

3253
02:13:07.720 --> 02:13:12.370
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're going to do is we're going to get </v>

3254
02:13:12.370 --> 02:13:14.230
<v Speaker 7>these enemy guys.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We're going to give them acid and </v>

3255
02:13:14.230 --> 02:13:14.420
<v Speaker 7>they're just going to tell us everything</v>
<v Speaker 7>turned out didn't work that way.</v>

3256
02:13:14.750 --> 02:13:17.210
<v Speaker 7>It was just there were too fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They couldn't make any sense.</v>

3257
02:13:17.270 --> 02:13:20.240
<v Speaker 7>They were talking about butterflies </v>
<v Speaker 7>stealing their underwear and you know,</v>

3258
02:13:20.241 --> 02:13:21.470
<v Speaker 7>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there were madness,</v>

3259
02:13:21.980 --> 02:13:23.330
<v Speaker 7>tripping,</v>
<v Speaker 7>tripping hard,</v>

3260
02:13:23.331 --> 02:13:28.331
<v Speaker 7>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they didn't know what the doses were </v>

3261
02:13:28.331 --> 02:13:30.760
<v Speaker 7>like.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The way I've heard it described acid </v>

3262
02:13:30.760 --> 02:13:30.760
<v Speaker 7>biochemically,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's a fascinating description,</v>

3263
02:13:30.760 --> 02:13:32.040
<v Speaker 7>but terrence mckenna said it best.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He said</v>

3264
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:37.040
<v Speaker 2>acid is so strong and the dose is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>small that an aunt could destroy the </v>

3265
02:13:38.161 --> 02:13:42.030
<v Speaker 2>entire empire state building in 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>

3266
02:13:42.300 --> 02:13:46.620
<v Speaker 2>Like that's literally how powerful acid </v>
<v Speaker 2>is per size per dose.</v>

3267
02:13:46.920 --> 02:13:51.920
<v Speaker 2>That and the analogy would be an aunt </v>
<v Speaker 2>destroying the empire state building in </v>

3268
02:13:51.920 --> 02:13:52.850
<v Speaker 2>30 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

3269
02:13:52.880 --> 02:13:57.880
<v Speaker 2>it's so intensely powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were given these people large </v>

3270
02:13:57.880 --> 02:13:58.440
<v Speaker 2>doses so they weren't getting any truth </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of them.</v>

3271
02:13:58.570 --> 02:14:01.380
<v Speaker 2>So then they thought about and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe this is the opposite,</v>

3272
02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:03.360
<v Speaker 2>this is what we'll do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll give it to our soldiers.</v>

3273
02:14:03.450 --> 02:14:05.400
<v Speaker 2>And tHen when they get captured we say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3274
02:14:05.500 --> 02:14:07.770
<v Speaker 2>pop this shit in your mouth to tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody shit.</v>

3275
02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:09.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would give them like a fucking,</v>

3276
02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:11.790
<v Speaker 2>like one of those juice boxes filled </v>
<v Speaker 2>with acid.</v>

3277
02:14:12.930 --> 02:14:16.290
<v Speaker 2>They would suck it down when they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the trenches and then no one would be</v>

3278
02:14:16.291 --> 02:14:18.120
<v Speaker 2>able to talk at all.</v>

3279
02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:19.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

3280
02:14:19.170 --> 02:14:21.330
<v Speaker 2>Just mine warped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then mind warp to.</v>

3281
02:14:21.480 --> 02:14:26.480
<v Speaker 2>Well they did a lot of tests for sure on</v>
<v Speaker 2>people where they didn't know about </v>

3282
02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:26.480
<v Speaker 2>acid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did those.</v>

3283
02:14:26.480 --> 02:14:29.220
<v Speaker 2>They did a lot of tests on soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both United States and the arm.</v>

3284
02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:34.280
<v Speaker 2>The britiSh armed forces did that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they also have the United States did </v>

3285
02:14:34.280 --> 02:14:37.640
<v Speaker 2>tests on unbeknown towns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did these clandestine operations </v>

3286
02:14:37.741 --> 02:14:42.741
<v Speaker 2>where they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they took this town in France and they </v>

3287
02:14:42.741 --> 02:14:42.741
<v Speaker 2>put acid in their bread,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3288
02:14:42.741 --> 02:14:44.970
<v Speaker 2>and like people died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people freaked out.</v>

3289
02:14:44.971 --> 02:14:46.340
<v Speaker 2>They did crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they,</v>

3290
02:14:46.750 --> 02:14:49.260
<v Speaker 2>they got like seriously dosed acid in </v>
<v Speaker 2>bread.</v>

3291
02:14:49.350 --> 02:14:54.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This ex cia agent talked about what he </v>

3292
02:14:54.350 --> 02:14:54.350
<v Speaker 2>did personally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the,</v>

3293
02:14:54.350 --> 02:14:56.190
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that stuck out in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>head is in Cuba.</v>

3294
02:14:56.550 --> 02:14:57.560
<v Speaker 2>They would find,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3295
02:14:57.561 --> 02:14:59.850
<v Speaker 2>the truck route to like elementary </v>
<v Speaker 2>schools,</v>

3296
02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:02.160
<v Speaker 2>hijack the truck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>filled the milk,</v>

3297
02:15:02.580 --> 02:15:03.600
<v Speaker 2>throw cement.</v>

3298
02:15:03.660 --> 02:15:08.660
<v Speaker 2>This is what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could be totally crazy in this </v>

3299
02:15:08.660 --> 02:15:09.150
<v Speaker 2>documentary and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's saying he's an ex cia agent and</v>

3300
02:15:09.151 --> 02:15:11.370
<v Speaker 2>this is stuff that they wanted a cost </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos.</v>

3301
02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:13.950
<v Speaker 2>They would infiltrate Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to,</v>

3302
02:15:14.550 --> 02:15:19.550
<v Speaker 2>they specifically targeted to blow up </v>
<v Speaker 2>bridges where they'd be women and </v>

3303
02:15:19.550 --> 02:15:20.250
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people would freak out.</v>

3304
02:15:20.340 --> 02:15:23.550
<v Speaker 2>They wanted as much cash as possible to </v>
<v Speaker 2>start a revolution.</v>

3305
02:15:23.551 --> 02:15:25.980
<v Speaker 2>And in the chaos that according to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>

3306
02:15:26.340 --> 02:15:29.460
<v Speaker 2>they would cause the cast and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they would come in and take control</v>

3307
02:15:29.461 --> 02:15:33.720
<v Speaker 2>of the drugs and sell the arms to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rebels.</v>

3308
02:15:33.750 --> 02:15:38.750
<v Speaker 2>Like that was the formula.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's a latin american country </v>

3309
02:15:38.750 --> 02:15:41.460
<v Speaker 2>like Nicaragua or wherever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean El Salvador or wherever that was.</v>

3310
02:15:41.461 --> 02:15:45.240
<v Speaker 2>The plan is to go in there cause chaos </v>
<v Speaker 2>arm the rebels,</v>

3311
02:15:45.241 --> 02:15:49.410
<v Speaker 2>sell them arms and blow shit up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blame it on the commies,</v>

3312
02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:50.760
<v Speaker 2>start a revolution.</v>

3313
02:15:50.790 --> 02:15:52.470
<v Speaker 2>Try to assassinate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

3314
02:15:52.471 --> 02:15:56.640
<v Speaker 2>according to the cia agents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're saying try to get the dictator,</v>

3315
02:15:56.641 --> 02:15:58.800
<v Speaker 2>assassinated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the chaos.</v>

3316
02:15:58.801 --> 02:16:02.550
<v Speaker 2>They take control of all the drugs on </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural resources,</v>

3317
02:16:02.551 --> 02:16:04.570
<v Speaker 2>oil and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and selling.</v>

3318
02:16:04.720 --> 02:16:09.720
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what the cia did according to </v>

3319
02:16:09.720 --> 02:16:09.720
<v Speaker 2>these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the job master do it.</v>

3320
02:16:09.720 --> 02:16:10.020
<v Speaker 2>TheY do it in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in asia,</v>

3321
02:16:10.110 --> 02:16:12.150
<v Speaker 2>they do it in latin America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do it in the middle east,</v>

3322
02:16:12.151 --> 02:16:13.860
<v Speaker 2>cause chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want the cast.</v>

3323
02:16:14.070 --> 02:16:16.860
<v Speaker 2>And then once the country's decimated </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3324
02:16:16.861 --> 02:16:19.140
<v Speaker 2>once the economy collapses because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>all this chaos,</v>

3325
02:16:19.410 --> 02:16:21.240
<v Speaker 2>the international bankers come in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

3326
02:16:21.390 --> 02:16:24.600
<v Speaker 2>and then they become the saviors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They come in and save and then they,</v>

3327
02:16:24.840 --> 02:16:29.840
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put in their own dictate and </v>

3328
02:16:29.840 --> 02:16:31.880
<v Speaker 2>pulling out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That whole country basically bankrupt </v>

3329
02:16:31.880 --> 02:16:31.880
<v Speaker 2>and then swoop</v>

3330
02:16:31.880 --> 02:16:31.880
<v Speaker 5>over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it makes sense,</v>

3331
02:16:31.880 --> 02:16:36.181
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like these gangsters and Arkansas with </v>

3332
02:16:36.181 --> 02:16:36.181
<v Speaker 5>the state,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is not a conspiracy theory.</v>

3333
02:16:36.181 --> 02:16:38.260
<v Speaker 5>Went down with the Iran contra hearings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They got busted.</v>

3334
02:16:38.261 --> 02:16:43.261
<v Speaker 5>Ronald reagan and george senior,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the head of the cia is the vice </v>

3335
02:16:43.261 --> 02:16:44.970
<v Speaker 5>president.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They get busted doing this and they know</v>

3336
02:16:45.250 --> 02:16:46.810
<v Speaker 5>Arkansas was whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bring it in.</v>

3337
02:16:46.811 --> 02:16:49.270
<v Speaker 5>And this is not a conspiracy theory,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is exactly what happened.</v>

3338
02:16:49.271 --> 02:16:51.550
<v Speaker 5>So who was the governor of Arkansas </v>
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>

3339
02:16:51.850 --> 02:16:53.710
<v Speaker 5>when all this coat came through in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>eighties,</v>

3340
02:16:54.220 --> 02:16:56.800
<v Speaker 5>bill clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was the one letting it all happen.</v>

3341
02:16:56.980 --> 02:17:00.520
<v Speaker 5>And then who takes over as president </v>
<v Speaker 5>after george senior,</v>

3342
02:17:00.730 --> 02:17:05.730
<v Speaker 5>the head of the cia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>once he steps down after he invades </v>

3343
02:17:05.730 --> 02:17:07.360
<v Speaker 5>Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bill clinton is the president.</v>

3344
02:17:07.450 --> 02:17:11.050
<v Speaker 5>They're running together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bill clinton is hooking up george senior</v>

3345
02:17:11.051 --> 02:17:15.370
<v Speaker 5>by letting them use Arkansas and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>becomes the president.</v>

3346
02:17:15.580 --> 02:17:20.580
<v Speaker 5>And then you watch their debates,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you go to youtube and watched their </v>

3347
02:17:20.580 --> 02:17:20.580
<v Speaker 5>debate and they're talking about sending</v>
<v Speaker 5>jobs overseas and,</v>

3348
02:17:20.580 --> 02:17:22.030
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're doing this with their hand,</v>

3349
02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:23.380
<v Speaker 5>like they got this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

3350
02:17:23.381 --> 02:17:24.520
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what this is,</v>

3351
02:17:24.521 --> 02:17:29.230
<v Speaker 5>but this must mean something to make a </v>
<v Speaker 5>point.</v>

3352
02:17:30.230 --> 02:17:31.900
<v Speaker 5>PresideNts really likes this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3353
02:17:31.901 --> 02:17:34.180
<v Speaker 5>you don't want to do this because this </v>
<v Speaker 5>is aggressive.</v>

3354
02:17:35.110 --> 02:17:37.300
<v Speaker 5>This is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can trust me,</v>

3355
02:17:37.390 --> 02:17:39.100
<v Speaker 5>but you're not hitting anybody like </v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

3356
02:17:40.580 --> 02:17:42.280
<v Speaker 5>Not a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to,</v>

3357
02:17:42.400 --> 02:17:46.800
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to lower taxes and we're going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to create more jobs stamp on.</v>

3358
02:17:46.840 --> 02:17:49.330
<v Speaker 5>You hear them talking about this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes you can gently do this.</v>

3359
02:17:49.480 --> 02:17:50.620
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and knowing,</v>

3360
02:17:50.710 --> 02:17:55.710
<v Speaker 5>knowing that their main Business is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bill clinton was hooking up george </v>

3361
02:17:55.710 --> 02:18:00.601
<v Speaker 5>singer knowing this and then now they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about the fucking balancing the </v>

3362
02:18:00.601 --> 02:18:01.090
<v Speaker 5>budget.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's hysterical.</v>

3363
02:18:01.091 --> 02:18:06.091
<v Speaker 5>It is like pro wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like their buddies behind the </v>

3364
02:18:06.091 --> 02:18:08.671
<v Speaker 5>scene,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but on camera they're pretending like </v>

3365
02:18:08.671 --> 02:18:09.690
<v Speaker 5>they're enemies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's insane conspiracy story.</v>

3366
02:18:10.010 --> 02:18:11.170
<v Speaker 5>He was a cia agent,</v>

3367
02:18:11.390 --> 02:18:14.540
<v Speaker 7>1951 in France.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Suddenly,</v>

3368
02:18:14.541 --> 02:18:18.620
<v Speaker 7>mysteriously people struck down with </v>
<v Speaker 7>mass insanity and hallucinations.</v>

3369
02:18:18.800 --> 02:18:23.800
<v Speaker 7>At least five people died.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dozens were interned in asylums and </v>

3370
02:18:23.800 --> 02:18:24.290
<v Speaker 7>hundreds of flicked it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the facts.</v>

3371
02:18:24.700 --> 02:18:29.700
<v Speaker 7>And it was assumed that the local bread </v>
<v Speaker 7>had been unwittingly poisoned with a </v>

3372
02:18:29.700 --> 02:18:30.530
<v Speaker 7>psychedelic mold,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which happens.</v>

3373
02:18:30.680 --> 02:18:33.560
<v Speaker 7>And that's what they're saying was </v>
<v Speaker 7>responsible for the salem witch trials.</v>

3374
02:18:33.920 --> 02:18:35.490
<v Speaker 7>They said the salem witch trials,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they've,</v>

3375
02:18:35.520 --> 02:18:37.620
<v Speaker 7>they've narrowed it down to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3376
02:18:38.060 --> 02:18:41.510
<v Speaker 7>apparently when there's an early frost,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when you have a wheat harvest,</v>

3377
02:18:41.690 --> 02:18:44.540
<v Speaker 7>early frost can trigger the growth of </v>
<v Speaker 7>god.</v>

3378
02:18:44.900 --> 02:18:49.900
<v Speaker 7>Or god is a type of fungus that grows on</v>
<v Speaker 7>wheat that has many of the same </v>

3379
02:18:49.900 --> 02:18:53.870
<v Speaker 7>qualities as lsd.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So when you consume this bread with this</v>

3380
02:18:53.900 --> 02:18:56.210
<v Speaker 7>[inaudible] got a wheat that has this or</v>
<v Speaker 7>god in it,</v>

3381
02:18:56.390 --> 02:18:58.790
<v Speaker 7>you trip your fucking brains out </v>
<v Speaker 7>naturally,</v>

3382
02:18:58.850 --> 02:19:03.850
<v Speaker 7>naturally in a scary way because you </v>
<v Speaker 7>imagine taking massive doses of acid in </v>

3383
02:19:03.891 --> 02:19:04.540
<v Speaker 7>your brand.</v>

3384
02:19:04.540 --> 02:19:06.860
<v Speaker 7>Even back then when your children are </v>
<v Speaker 7>tripping out,</v>

3385
02:19:06.861 --> 02:19:11.861
<v Speaker 7>your children are freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everyone thinks everyone's haunted and </v>

3386
02:19:11.861 --> 02:19:12.440
<v Speaker 7>they just start drowning witches.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're like,</v>

3387
02:19:12.470 --> 02:19:13.930
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's insane.</v>

3388
02:19:14.060 --> 02:19:16.740
<v Speaker 7>Or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Netflix about salem witch trials.</v>

3389
02:19:16.750 --> 02:19:18.520
<v Speaker 7>So it was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We got a lot of people just thought that</v>

3390
02:19:18.530 --> 02:19:21.560
<v Speaker 7>they were being thrown under a spell,</v>
<v Speaker 7>know they,</v>

3391
02:19:21.570 --> 02:19:23.180
<v Speaker 7>they literally didn't realize what was </v>
<v Speaker 7>going on.</v>

3392
02:19:23.390 --> 02:19:27.140
<v Speaker 7>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they had blamed this shit on earth until</v>

3393
02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:33.040
<v Speaker 7>and now they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they believe that what's going on was </v>

3394
02:19:33.040 --> 02:19:35.410
<v Speaker 7>that the cia had cia documents that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3395
02:19:35.420 --> 02:19:40.420
<v Speaker 7>this guy found while investigating this </v>
<v Speaker 7>suspicious suicide of a man named Frank </v>

3396
02:19:40.420 --> 02:19:42.190
<v Speaker 7>Olson,</v>
<v Speaker 7>who is a biochemist working for the sod,</v>

3397
02:19:42.230 --> 02:19:47.230
<v Speaker 7>fell from the 13th floor window two </v>
<v Speaker 7>years after the curse bread incident in </v>

3398
02:19:47.230 --> 02:19:51.341
<v Speaker 7>France.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And one onenote transcribes the </v>

3399
02:19:51.341 --> 02:19:51.740
<v Speaker 7>conversation between the cia agent and a</v>
<v Speaker 7>sandoz official.</v>

3400
02:19:51.741 --> 02:19:55.550
<v Speaker 7>Santos is the people that eventuallY </v>
<v Speaker 7>started producing in mass quantities,</v>

3401
02:19:55.551 --> 02:19:58.150
<v Speaker 7>lsd.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They,</v>

3402
02:19:58.190 --> 02:20:03.190
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>mentIoned the secret point st a esprit </v>

3403
02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:07.060
<v Speaker 7>experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a point esprit st [inaudible] was where </v>

3404
02:20:07.060 --> 02:20:11.051
<v Speaker 7>this all went down.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So they had mentioned it in a memo and </v>

3405
02:20:11.051 --> 02:20:11.420
<v Speaker 7>explained that it was not at all caused </v>
<v Speaker 7>by mold,</v>

3406
02:20:11.690 --> 02:20:16.690
<v Speaker 7>but by diane hamid that d and lsd said </v>
<v Speaker 7>they had,</v>

3407
02:20:17.390 --> 02:20:22.250
<v Speaker 7>they had injected this shit into this </v>
<v Speaker 7>town's bread supply just to watch it,</v>

3408
02:20:22.700 --> 02:20:26.780
<v Speaker 7>just to sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just to absorb what happens when you get</v>

3409
02:20:26.781 --> 02:20:30.230
<v Speaker 7>a whole town on acid in 1951.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They dIdn't know any,</v>

3410
02:20:30.290 --> 02:20:35.290
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they didn't really have all the data in </v>

3411
02:20:35.290 --> 02:20:35.290
<v Speaker 7>1951.</v>

3412
02:20:35.290 --> 02:20:35.290
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know anything about that,</v>

3413
02:20:35.290 --> 02:20:38.060
<v Speaker 5>but you're telling me that it's like </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're fucking criminals.</v>

3414
02:20:38.240 --> 02:20:38.660
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

3415
02:20:38.661 --> 02:20:40.490
<v Speaker 7>some of them were,</v>
<v Speaker 7>some of them are,</v>

3416
02:20:40.520 --> 02:20:42.170
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>some of them back then.</v>

3417
02:20:42.440 --> 02:20:47.440
<v Speaker 7>The,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my hope for real is that the internet </v>

3418
02:20:47.440 --> 02:20:48.790
<v Speaker 7>provides such an access to information,</v>
<v Speaker 7>such a,</v>

3419
02:20:48.800 --> 02:20:53.800
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a boundary dissolving thing between </v>

3420
02:20:53.800 --> 02:20:56.810
<v Speaker 7>people and the truth that anything that </v>
<v Speaker 7>happens from now to the future or from,</v>

3421
02:20:56.840 --> 02:20:58.430
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>five years from now in the future,</v>

3422
02:20:58.850 --> 02:21:03.850
<v Speaker 7>everyone will be so accountable for </v>
<v Speaker 7>their actions because it'll be so </v>

3423
02:21:03.850 --> 02:21:05.060
<v Speaker 7>obvious and clear that they just won't </v>
<v Speaker 7>be able to run things.</v>

3424
02:21:05.061 --> 02:21:10.061
<v Speaker 7>Businesses usual,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the corruption will slowly morphed down </v>

3425
02:21:10.061 --> 02:21:11.900
<v Speaker 7>to a very reasonable level because it'll</v>
<v Speaker 7>all be transparent.</v>

3426
02:21:11.990 --> 02:21:13.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I remember,</v>

3427
02:21:13.970 --> 02:21:18.970
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's so many different conspiracy </v>

3428
02:21:18.970 --> 02:21:18.970
<v Speaker 5>theories and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

3429
02:21:18.970 --> 02:21:19.280
<v Speaker 5>and you just don't have time to really </v>
<v Speaker 5>look into them all.</v>

3430
02:21:19.490 --> 02:21:23.240
<v Speaker 5>And I remember you being really into jfk</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I never really spent that much time.</v>

3431
02:21:23.360 --> 02:21:25.460
<v Speaker 5>It just seemed like when someone would </v>
<v Speaker 5>tell me that was,</v>

3432
02:21:25.640 --> 02:21:30.640
<v Speaker 5>it was an inside job,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just knowing what these criminals do </v>

3433
02:21:30.640 --> 02:21:30.770
<v Speaker 5>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3434
02:21:30.771 --> 02:21:32.090
<v Speaker 5>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I just haven't looked into it.</v>

3435
02:21:32.091 --> 02:21:37.091
<v Speaker 5>But recently,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just recently I've been obsessed with </v>

3436
02:21:37.091 --> 02:21:39.050
<v Speaker 5>the jfk case.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing,</v>

3437
02:21:39.280 --> 02:21:40.340
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>To think,</v>

3438
02:21:40.400 --> 02:21:43.280
<v Speaker 5>to think that all the stuff that I did </v>
<v Speaker 5>spend time in,</v>

3439
02:21:43.281 --> 02:21:47.000
<v Speaker 5>that it's all connected all from world </v>
<v Speaker 5>war ii,</v>

02:21:47.060 --> 02:21:49.540
<v Speaker 5>prescott bush,</v>
<v Speaker 5>george singer,</v>

3441
02:21:49.580 --> 02:21:51.440
<v Speaker 5>jfk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nixon,</v>

3442
02:21:51.590 --> 02:21:54.920
<v Speaker 5>all the way up to george senior becoming</v>
<v Speaker 5>vice president,</v>

3443
02:21:54.921 --> 02:21:56.990
<v Speaker 5>ronald reagan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bill clinton,</v>

<v Speaker 5>bam,</v>
<v Speaker 5>george w.</v>

3445
02:21:59.270 --> 02:22:01.460
<v Speaker 5>How dId that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then obama,</v>

3446
02:22:01.880 --> 02:22:06.880
<v Speaker 5>all of it is all connected and it all </v>
<v Speaker 5>has cii running right through it.</v>

3447
02:22:08.270 --> 02:22:09.800
<v Speaker 7>Part of the average person on the </v>
<v Speaker 7>ultimate,</v>

3448
02:22:09.830 --> 02:22:11.370
<v Speaker 7>the underground right now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Go ahead.</v>

3449
02:22:11.490 --> 02:22:14.400
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck are they talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Conspiracy theories where Jeremy Stevens</v>

3450
02:22:14.401 --> 02:22:19.401
<v Speaker 5>on the pod training and diet and </v>
<v Speaker 5>nutrition.</v>

3451
02:22:22.200 --> 02:22:26.070
<v Speaker 5>We do what we want to hear about this </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff</v>

3452
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:28.020
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because honestly if it opens up a lot of</v>

3453
02:22:28.021 --> 02:22:33.021
<v Speaker 6>people's eyes to really stuff that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>going on and you bring up a lot of good </v>

3454
02:22:33.021 --> 02:22:33.030
<v Speaker 6>points,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like why aren't we seeing documents like</v>

3455
02:22:33.031 --> 02:22:34.750
<v Speaker 6>that in school that says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3456
02:22:34.770 --> 02:22:37.920
<v Speaker 6>george senior was cia type stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 6>some of these events that were</v>

3457
02:22:37.970 --> 02:22:40.280
<v Speaker 2>pretty much history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was the head of the cia.</v>

3458
02:22:40.281 --> 02:22:41.800
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's history george sr.</v>

3459
02:22:42.120 --> 02:22:44.770
<v Speaker 2>That alone is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's again,</v>

3460
02:22:44.771 --> 02:22:47.220
<v Speaker 2>that's not a conspiracy theory history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

3461
02:22:47.270 --> 02:22:49.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way more disturbing George Bush,</v>

3462
02:22:50.070 --> 02:22:52.640
<v Speaker 2>but that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of disturbing,</v>

3463
02:22:52.670 --> 02:22:57.670
<v Speaker 2>but George Bush senior being ahead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cia's and natural progression going </v>

3464
02:22:57.670 --> 02:22:59.840
<v Speaker 2>from one big top office to another kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of makes sense.</v>

3465
02:22:59.960 --> 02:23:03.500
<v Speaker 2>What doesn't make sense at all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's really scary is the dick cheney</v>

3466
02:23:03.501 --> 02:23:06.860
<v Speaker 2>halliburton connection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that dick cheney was the ceo of</v>

3467
02:23:06.861 --> 02:23:08.240
<v Speaker 2>halliburton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He leaves.</v>

3468
02:23:08.241 --> 02:23:10.850
<v Speaker 2>Halliburton becomes a vice president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had states.</v>

3469
02:23:10.970 --> 02:23:15.410
<v Speaker 2>Then halliburton starts getting these no</v>
<v Speaker 2>bid contracts to rebuild Iraq.</v>

3470
02:23:15.710 --> 02:23:19.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean these huge multibillion dollar </v>
<v Speaker 2>con,</v>

3471
02:23:19.330 --> 02:23:24.330
<v Speaker 2>these contracts to rebuild Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a war that dick cheney's trying to get </v>

3472
02:23:24.330 --> 02:23:25.310
<v Speaker 2>us into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the tip of the iceberg.</v>

3473
02:23:25.460 --> 02:23:28.340
<v Speaker 2>To think that that's only happening </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of george senior.</v>

3474
02:23:28.550 --> 02:23:33.550
<v Speaker 2>When ronald reagan got busted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got busted wide open selling arms </v>

3475
02:23:34.521 --> 02:23:39.521
<v Speaker 2>to the contracts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got busted in all the coke and </v>

3476
02:23:39.521 --> 02:23:43.240
<v Speaker 2>nobody went to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think that stuff's going down over </v>

3477
02:23:43.240 --> 02:23:43.240
<v Speaker 2>north?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Took the oliver north,</v>

3478
02:23:43.240 --> 02:23:43.960
<v Speaker 6>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think.</v>

3479
02:23:43.990 --> 02:23:45.250
<v Speaker 6>I think that stuff is me.</v>

02:25:34.731 --> 02:25:37.570
<v Speaker 3>the culture is way different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of different things.</v>

3529
02:25:37.571 --> 02:25:40.600
<v Speaker 3>Like san diego has a way laid back vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's cool.</v>

3530
02:25:40.601 --> 02:25:44.020
<v Speaker 3>It's like nothing going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But realize that like a half hour away,</v>

3531
02:25:44.021 --> 02:25:49.021
<v Speaker 3>there's shootings every day that's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>down and just their buildings look a </v>

3532
02:25:49.021 --> 02:25:49.870
<v Speaker 3>little a lot more ghetto and just the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way they live,</v>

3533
02:25:50.110 --> 02:25:55.110
<v Speaker 3>you almost when you go back and you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>that type of experience being over </v>

3534
02:25:55.110 --> 02:25:57.811
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you almost just appreciate going into a </v>

3535
02:25:57.811 --> 02:25:57.811
<v Speaker 3>clean neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3536
02:25:57.811 --> 02:25:58.390
<v Speaker 3>driving by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>

3537
02:25:58.450 --> 02:26:01.630
<v Speaker 3>What is it like being that close?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You never think about it.</v>

3538
02:26:01.660 --> 02:26:03.270
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever hear about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spilling over.</v>

3539
02:26:03.340 --> 02:26:05.230
<v Speaker 3>You hear about kidnappings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hear about,</v>

3540
02:26:05.570 --> 02:26:07.630
<v Speaker 3>you hear a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hear a lot of stuff,</v>

3541
02:26:07.631 --> 02:26:07.780
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

3542
02:26:07.780 --> 02:26:09.700
<v Speaker 3>And then like sometimes there's like </v>
<v Speaker 3>helicopters flying,</v>

3543
02:26:09.701 --> 02:26:11.170
<v Speaker 3>like have you seen this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever,</v>

3544
02:26:11.171 --> 02:26:16.171
<v Speaker 3>blah blah blah blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So kidnappings because it's easy to get </v>

3545
02:26:16.171 --> 02:26:16.171
<v Speaker 3>back into Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3546
02:26:16.171 --> 02:26:18.900
<v Speaker 3>Getting back into Mexico is like human </v>
<v Speaker 3>trafficking in drugs that you know,</v>

3547
02:26:19.010 --> 02:26:24.010
<v Speaker 3>people that are stuff that people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>making movies on and making millioNs of </v>

3548
02:26:24.010 --> 02:26:24.010
<v Speaker 3>dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3549
02:26:24.010 --> 02:26:24.010
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all cool.</v>

3550
02:26:24.010 --> 02:26:25.820
<v Speaker 3>But that stuff really goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3551
02:26:25.870 --> 02:26:28.990
<v Speaker 3>there's a big war on drugs and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like you said that,</v>

3552
02:26:29.530 --> 02:26:34.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hear about people like governments </v>

3553
02:26:34.530 --> 02:26:36.391
<v Speaker 3>funding and this and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean where do you think they're </v>

3554
02:26:36.391 --> 02:26:36.391
<v Speaker 3>getting these type of guns in this type </v>
<v Speaker 3>of muscle?</v>

3555
02:26:36.391 --> 02:26:38.120
<v Speaker 3>Because the drug cartel will basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll,</v>

3556
02:26:38.140 --> 02:26:41.410
<v Speaker 3>they'll buy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll buy like say like say joe rogan.</v>

3557
02:26:41.411 --> 02:26:46.411
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like an army general guy and you </v>

3558
02:26:46.411 --> 02:26:46.411
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3559
02:26:46.411 --> 02:26:48.630
<v Speaker 3>some secret stuff on weapons and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>only getting paid $100 a week to feed </v>

3560
02:26:48.630 --> 02:26:50.050
<v Speaker 3>your family and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell you what,</v>

3561
02:26:50.051 --> 02:26:51.400
<v Speaker 3>we're going to pay you $100,000.</v>

3562
02:26:51.400 --> 02:26:52.930
<v Speaker 3>We're going to put you and your family </v>
<v Speaker 3>and in a,</v>

3563
02:26:53.180 --> 02:26:54.280
<v Speaker 3>in a house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

3564
02:26:54.460 --> 02:26:56.860
<v Speaker 3>but if you mess up or if you do anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong will kill you.</v>

3565
02:26:56.861 --> 02:26:58.240
<v Speaker 3>Your whole family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then some,</v>

3566
02:26:58.720 --> 02:26:59.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they'll,</v>

3567
02:26:59.400 --> 02:27:02.650
<v Speaker 3>they'll take like head corporate people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that know how to build like a,</v>

3568
02:27:02.660 --> 02:27:07.660
<v Speaker 3>they'll building submarines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll get these people in the jungle </v>

3569
02:27:07.660 --> 02:27:10.621
<v Speaker 3>that know how to build this stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then they'll submarine hundreds and </v>

3570
02:27:10.621 --> 02:27:11.750
<v Speaker 3>millions of dollars of drug cartel and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3571
02:27:11.880 --> 02:27:12.910
<v Speaker 3>it's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3572
02:27:12.911 --> 02:27:14.670
<v Speaker 3>and this stuff actually goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if.</v>

3573
02:27:14.900 --> 02:27:18.070
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine if there was like a map </v>
<v Speaker 3>I can overlay of the United States.</v>

3574
02:27:18.071 --> 02:27:23.030
<v Speaker 3>We could just theoretically watch like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>highlight of all the cocaine both</v>

3575
02:27:23.170 --> 02:27:26.800
<v Speaker 5>come in on daily basis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's a big shipment right there,</v>

3576
02:27:26.801 --> 02:27:28.730
<v Speaker 5>joe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As crazy as that is</v>

3577
02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:31.010
<v Speaker 3>forcement couldn't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you can see it.</v>

3578
02:27:31.250 --> 02:27:33.860
<v Speaker 3>law enforcement gets paid off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not see it or they do are they?</v>

3579
02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:38.880
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's crazy as that is and that all does </v>

3580
02:27:38.880 --> 02:27:40.741
<v Speaker 5>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All these cartels are real according to </v>

3581
02:27:40.741 --> 02:27:42.220
<v Speaker 5>these ex cia agents and all the stuff </v>
<v Speaker 5>that was going on in mena,</v>

3582
02:27:42.580 --> 02:27:47.580
<v Speaker 5>that's a small,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tiny fraction compared to what the cia </v>

3583
02:27:47.580 --> 02:27:50.671
<v Speaker 5>is dumping.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they're bringing in giant fucking </v>

3584
02:27:50.671 --> 02:27:51.610
<v Speaker 5>military planes filled with tons and </v>
<v Speaker 5>tons of coke and the,</v>

<v Speaker 5>the carton.</v>

3586
02:27:52.570 --> 02:27:54.340
<v Speaker 5>Then every now and then they'll bust a </v>
<v Speaker 5>little cartel,</v>

3587
02:27:54.341 --> 02:27:55.570

3614
02:28:46.450 --> 02:28:51.450
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I'm sure you heard of el chapo </v>

3615
02:28:51.450 --> 02:28:51.450
<v Speaker 4>guzman who escaped from a high security </v>

3621
02:29:03.790 --> 02:29:07.620
<v Speaker 4>I haven't got to see the two escobars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the greatest documentary bro.</v>

3623
02:29:12.910 --> 02:29:12.920
<v Speaker 4>talking about conspiracy theories about </v>
<v Speaker 4>pablo escobar,</v>

3624
02:29:12.921 --> 02:29:13.380
<v Speaker 4>but this is not.</v>

3625
02:29:13.380 --> 02:29:14.450
<v Speaker 4>It has nothing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Conspiracy.</v>

3626
02:29:14.451 --> 02:29:17.180
<v Speaker 4>This is one of the biggest drug lords </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>

3627
02:29:17.181 --> 02:29:22.181
<v Speaker 4>Pablo escobar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's about him and how he got </v>

3628
02:29:22.181 --> 02:29:22.740
<v Speaker 4>involved with soccer and columbia and </v>
<v Speaker 4>how he,</v>

3629

<v Speaker 4>he almost became political,</v>

3630
02:29:25.700 --> 02:29:30.700
<v Speaker 4>but then there was a backlash of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that he was doing because they </v>

3631
02:29:30.700 --> 02:29:32.030
<v Speaker 4>loved him like a god down there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he was feeding The poor.</v>

3632
02:29:32.180 --> 02:29:33.960
<v Speaker 4>Like he was doing this crazy stuff with </v>
<v Speaker 4>like his,</v>

3633
02:29:33.961 --> 02:29:38.961
<v Speaker 4>his drug money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he just didn't want anybody messing </v>

3634
02:29:38.961 --> 02:29:38.961
<v Speaker 4>with his family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he was feeding the poor.</v>

3635
02:29:38.961 --> 02:29:40.430
<v Speaker 4>He was doing so much for politics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3636
02:29:40.431 --> 02:29:42.130
<v Speaker 4>there was a lot of killing going on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>

3637
02:29:42.160 --> 02:29:43.460
<v Speaker 4>which is involved in drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3638
02:29:43.461 --> 02:29:48.461
<v Speaker 4>a lot of families were dying so then </v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a big retaliation toward him </v>

3639
02:29:48.461 --> 02:29:49.580
<v Speaker 4>and the things that were going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then like the politics,</v>

02:29:49.581 --> 02:29:50.510
<v Speaker 4>like cut them off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3641

3692
02:31:53.371 --> 02:31:54.360
<v Speaker 5>And they,</v>

3695
02:31:59.361 --> 02:32:02.151
<v Speaker 5>wars on the street.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there was so much bloodshed that </v>

3696
02:32:02.151 --> 02:32:02.151
<v Speaker 5>they finally said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3697
02:32:02.151 --> 02:32:03.350
<v Speaker 5>we are changing the god damn law.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now go to jail.</v>

3699
02:32:05.070 --> 02:32:07.020
<v Speaker 5>So he goes to the jail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And meanwhile,</v>

3700
02:32:07.021 --> 02:32:10.200
<v Speaker 5>that whole time he built the jail,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he set it up,</v>

3701
02:32:10.230 --> 02:32:12.360
<v Speaker 5>he had nightclubs in their tunnels to </v>
<v Speaker 5>escape.</v>

3702
02:32:12.480 --> 02:32:14.730
<v Speaker 5>They had no idea that he went to his own</v>
<v Speaker 5>jail.</v>

02:32:14.850 --> 02:32:17.030
<v Speaker 5>He was part,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was leaving anytime he wanted.</v>

3704
02:32:17.610 --> 02:32:22.610

<v Speaker 5>So when they finally figured it out </v>

3705
02:32:22.610 --> 02:32:24.050
<v Speaker 5>because they took it,</v>

3707
02:32:29.180 --> 02:32:29.520

<v Speaker 5>So they murdered them.</v>

3708
02:32:29.700 --> 02:32:31.920
<v Speaker 5>So once they find out that they figured </v>

02:34:04.730 --> 02:34:06.740
<v Speaker 2>do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do it well.</v>

3758
02:34:06.770 --> 02:34:11.770
<v Speaker 2>My mother was born in America son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finally we got a mexican heavyweight </v>

3759
02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:17.710
<v Speaker 2>boxing american born here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cello favorite.</v>

3760
02:34:17.950 --> 02:34:18.300
<v Speaker 2>Taylor</v>

3761
02:34:18.330 --> 02:34:20.050
<v Speaker 6>refined them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He turned to him pretty good.</v>

3762
02:34:20.051 --> 02:34:22.060
<v Speaker 6>I imagine about being a director.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Tell,</v>

3763
02:34:22.061 --> 02:34:22.290
<v Speaker 6>so</v>

3764
02:34:22.520 --> 02:34:27.520
<v Speaker 7>I don't think he would mind knowing what</v>
<v Speaker 7>kind of a beating he's going to give </v>

3765
02:34:27.520 --> 02:34:28.400
<v Speaker 7>child the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Cain valasquez would do in boxing.</v>

3766
02:34:29.390 --> 02:34:30.200
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>who knows?</v>

3767
02:34:30.201 --> 02:34:31.760
<v Speaker 7>I mean he would have to get really good </v>
<v Speaker 7>at it.</v>

3768
02:34:31.850 --> 02:34:32.570
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's a.</v>

3769
02:34:32.650 --> 02:34:34.790
<v Speaker 7>There's a big difference between a guy </v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

3770
02:34:34.791 --> 02:34:37.720
<v Speaker 7>like let's say andre ward.</v>
<v Speaker 7>See andre ward's fight this weekend.</v>

3771
02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.160
<v Speaker 7>He fought this dude who was a serious </v>
<v Speaker 7>knockout.</v>

3772
02:34:40.161 --> 02:34:41.420
<v Speaker 7>Punch her,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I forget the guy's name,</v>

3773
02:34:41.750 --> 02:34:45.140
<v Speaker 7>but a andre words.</v>
<v Speaker 7>just box circles around them and it just</v>

3774
02:34:45.230 --> 02:34:47.300
<v Speaker 7>cracked him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Hit him with some big shots,</v>

3775
02:34:47.530 --> 02:34:49.400
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like basically dominated him,</v>

3776
02:34:49.401 --> 02:34:54.180
<v Speaker 7>but this guy was a bad ass fucking boxer</v>
<v Speaker 7>and he's a really high level box guy.</v>

3777
02:34:54.181 --> 02:34:56.960
<v Speaker 7>Was undefeated,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a big knockout record.</v>

3778
02:34:57.760 --> 02:35:02.760
<v Speaker 7>Just a big difference between a guy </v>
<v Speaker 7>who's a guy that's good at boxing and </v>

3779
02:35:02.760 --> 02:35:04.820
<v Speaker 7>mma when there's all these other </v>
<v Speaker 7>techniques,</v>

3780
02:35:04.821 --> 02:35:07.430
<v Speaker 7>especially guys like king is such a </v>
<v Speaker 7>great wrestler.</v>

3781
02:35:07.700 --> 02:35:12.700
<v Speaker 7>I mean his name is all about </v>
<v Speaker 7>transitioning from striking the take </v>

3782
02:35:12.700 --> 02:35:12.840
<v Speaker 7>down,</v>
<v Speaker 7>take down,</v>

3783
02:35:12.870 --> 02:35:17.870
<v Speaker 7>striking meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If a boxer wanted to fight him and then </v>

3784
02:35:17.870 --> 02:35:17.870
<v Speaker 7>maybe he would kill him,</v>
<v Speaker 7>kill him,</v>

3785
02:35:17.870 --> 02:35:22.040
<v Speaker 7>but he would have to really absorb the </v>
<v Speaker 7>game of boxing to compete as a box.</v>

3786
02:35:22.440 --> 02:35:24.990
<v Speaker 7>Has the best chance to be came to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's fine.</v>

3787
02:35:25.570 --> 02:35:28.300
<v Speaker 6>No man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

3788
02:35:28.310 --> 02:35:30.800
<v Speaker 6>He's been knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think travis browne coming up.</v>

3789
02:35:30.890 --> 02:35:33.680
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Try like travis scott and josh.</v>

3790
02:35:34.910 --> 02:35:39.910
<v Speaker 6>Josh barnett,</v>
<v Speaker 6>catch them with the submission or </v>

3791
02:35:39.910 --> 02:35:39.910
<v Speaker 6>something that would be a guy that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that uh,</v>

3792
02:35:39.910 --> 02:35:42.320
<v Speaker 6>would eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what josh can take came down.</v>

3793
02:35:42.440 --> 02:35:46.080
<v Speaker 6>Who knows my most likely no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

3794
02:35:46.100 --> 02:35:47.960
<v Speaker 6>but I think that would be good range and</v>
<v Speaker 6>be able to.</v>

3795
02:35:47.961 --> 02:35:49.210
<v Speaker 6>Russell and russell,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm off them.</v>

3796
02:35:49.260 --> 02:35:54.260
<v Speaker 6>Then maybe take them down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who knows what josh barnett is gonna </v>

3797
02:35:54.260 --> 02:35:54.260
<v Speaker 6>show up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know this guy,</v>

3798
02:35:54.260 --> 02:35:54.260
<v Speaker 6>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3799
02:35:54.260 --> 02:35:56.120
<v Speaker 6>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's dealt with a lot of past stuff,</v>

3800
02:35:56.121 --> 02:35:57.680
<v Speaker 6>but I think when you get back in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>ufc,</v>

3801
02:35:57.681 --> 02:36:02.681
<v Speaker 6>especially not this time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think he might be rejuvenated in this </v>

3802
02:36:02.681 --> 02:36:03.350
<v Speaker 6>fight with travis browne is a huge </v>
<v Speaker 6>fight.</v>

3803
02:36:03.351 --> 02:36:06.620
<v Speaker 6>Travis browne is definitely young talent</v>
<v Speaker 6>to do it on his way up.</v>

3804
02:36:06.621 --> 02:36:08.240
<v Speaker 6>He's hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know he's working hard,</v>

3805
02:36:08.241 --> 02:36:10.670
<v Speaker 6>so these two are really going to set the</v>
<v Speaker 6>standard.</v>

3806
02:36:10.671 --> 02:36:15.671
<v Speaker 6>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who wants to take It to that next level </v>

3807
02:36:15.671 --> 02:36:15.671
<v Speaker 6>and go up there and challenge came for </v>
<v Speaker 6>that belt.</v>

3808
02:36:15.671 --> 02:36:15.750
<v Speaker 6>so great fucking fight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

3809
02:36:15.780 --> 02:36:17.590
<v Speaker 6>Huge freshly coming off your foster.</v>

3810
02:36:18.240 --> 02:36:18.960
<v Speaker 7>Let me tell you something,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

3811
02:36:18.961 --> 02:36:20.870
<v Speaker 7>There's not a lot of heavyweights on the</v>
<v Speaker 7>planet.</v>

3812
02:36:20.880 --> 02:36:24.000
<v Speaker 7>They have stood that beating that he </v>
<v Speaker 7>took in that first round from</v>

3813
02:36:24.500 --> 02:36:27.350
<v Speaker 6>just insane doodles,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I forgot.</v>

3814
02:36:27.351 --> 02:36:29.240
<v Speaker 6>I need like that bro.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just give me a second.</v>

3815
02:36:29.740 --> 02:36:32.750
<v Speaker 6>His knees are so much harder than </v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody else's.</v>

3816
02:36:32.840 --> 02:36:34.610
<v Speaker 6>He throws him so different.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Unlike anybody.</v>

3817
02:36:34.611 --> 02:36:37.820
<v Speaker 6>He's like one tuesday and then just </v>
<v Speaker 6>bombard you with this knee.</v>

3818
02:36:37.850 --> 02:36:39.210
<v Speaker 6>The ruthless.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's crazy.</v>

3819
02:36:39.290 --> 02:36:41.490
<v Speaker 7>It's like getting hit over and over </v>
<v Speaker 7>again with a battery graham.</v>

3820
02:36:42.080 --> 02:36:45.050
<v Speaker 7>But somehow or another travis browne </v>
<v Speaker 7>gutted through that shit.</v>

3821
02:36:45.080 --> 02:36:47.270
<v Speaker 7>Literally got it through it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's amazing.</v>

3822
02:36:47.330 --> 02:36:48.650
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They got up in front,</v>

3823
02:36:48.651 --> 02:36:50.480
<v Speaker 7>kicked him in the face and the same </v>
<v Speaker 7>round.</v>

3824
02:36:50.850 --> 02:36:51.740
<v Speaker 7>I mean crazy.</v>

3825
02:36:51.800 --> 02:36:56.800
<v Speaker 6>You know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you get kicked in the face one time </v>

3826
02:36:56.800 --> 02:36:56.800
<v Speaker 6>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

3827
02:36:56.800 --> 02:36:56.800
<v Speaker 6>you got me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

3828
02:36:56.800 --> 02:36:56.800
<v Speaker 6>I'm still a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3829
02:36:56.800 --> 02:36:59.200
<v Speaker 6>if you're still conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But he kicked him in the face like two,</v>

3830
02:36:59.210 --> 02:37:00.920
<v Speaker 6>three times and he was just leaning </v>
<v Speaker 6>toward it,</v>

3831
02:37:00.921 --> 02:37:01.520
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

3832
02:37:01.521 --> 02:37:04.640
<v Speaker 6>don't move.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just shot his wife.</v>

3833
02:37:04.830 --> 02:37:09.830
<v Speaker 6>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the snap kicks to the chest into the </v>

3834
02:37:11.601 --> 02:37:12.950
<v Speaker 6>jaw.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That ain't no joke.</v>

3835
02:37:13.760 --> 02:37:15.140
<v Speaker 6>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're seeing them a lot.</v>

3836
02:37:15.320 --> 02:37:16.040
<v Speaker 6>You didn't see them two</v>

3837
02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:17.020
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about all,</v>

3838
02:37:17.120 --> 02:37:18.980
<v Speaker 4>are you throwing those snapchat</v>

3839
02:37:19.640 --> 02:37:22.670
<v Speaker 6>and his last fight and try to throw them</v>
<v Speaker 6>at me and I was push and I was like,</v>

3840
02:37:22.700 --> 02:37:23.380
<v Speaker 6>hold up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3841
02:37:23.390 --> 02:37:28.390
<v Speaker 6>like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're deceiving because like all of a </v>

3842
02:37:28.390 --> 02:37:30.611
<v Speaker 6>sudden this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I normally look at the chest when I </v>

3843
02:37:30.611 --> 02:37:32.741
<v Speaker 6>fight because I can,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can tell where his hips are going to </v>

3844
02:37:32.741 --> 02:37:35.261
<v Speaker 6>be.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I could see his base and I can see his </v>

3845
02:37:35.261 --> 02:37:37.271
<v Speaker 6>feet and I could see where his hands are</v>
<v Speaker 6>lined up so I know I want to keep like </v>

3846
02:37:37.271 --> 02:37:37.271
<v Speaker 6>good range,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but those,</v>

3847
02:37:37.271 --> 02:37:41.520
<v Speaker 6>those kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're deceiving because you got to </v>

3848
02:37:41.520 --> 02:37:43.570
<v Speaker 6>raise them with like your knee,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so it's like your elbow going through </v>

3849
02:37:43.570 --> 02:37:46.451
<v Speaker 6>first to hit like a baseball.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the elbow always leads just like the </v>

3850
02:37:46.451 --> 02:37:47.530
<v Speaker 6>knees so the knee pops up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't know if he's still in like a,</v>

3851
02:37:47.560 --> 02:37:52.560
<v Speaker 6>like maybe a fake back knee,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it happened so quick and it pops </v>

3852
02:37:52.560 --> 02:37:52.560
<v Speaker 6>right in your face</v>

3853
02:37:52.560 --> 02:37:57.290
<v Speaker 4>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing that we've gone this long </v>

3854
02:37:57.290 --> 02:37:59.870
<v Speaker 4>in the ufc and we just figured out this </v>
<v Speaker 4>old basic ass karate party is actually </v>

3855
02:38:00.211 --> 02:38:04.140
<v Speaker 4>really useful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're nobody practiced it.</v>

3856
02:38:04.380 --> 02:38:06.230
<v Speaker 4>Nobody bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they,</v>

3857
02:38:06.240 --> 02:38:11.240
<v Speaker 4>jim after mma gym was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're striking coaches telling their </v>

3858
02:38:11.240 --> 02:38:11.820
<v Speaker 4>students not to throw those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3859
02:38:11.860 --> 02:38:16.140
<v Speaker 4>those don't work time after time we see </v>
<v Speaker 4>how much of a follow the leader thing is</v>

3860
02:38:16.141 --> 02:38:21.141
<v Speaker 4>going on in mma because a guy like </v>
<v Speaker 4>anderson lands that front kick and </v>

3861
02:38:21.141 --> 02:38:23.610
<v Speaker 4>knocks out vittorio and the whole sport </v>
<v Speaker 4>changes like overnight.</v>

3862
02:38:23.850 --> 02:38:28.850
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's thrown in front.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Josh thompson storing them like a </v>

3863
02:38:28.850 --> 02:38:28.900
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anthony pettis is throwing crazy kicks.</v>

3864
02:38:29.180 --> 02:38:30.870
<v Speaker 4>Crazy knees like I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

3865
02:38:31.190 --> 02:38:35.430
<v Speaker 4>I think we know now that all these crazy</v>
<v Speaker 4>kicks do work.</v>

3866
02:38:35.431 --> 02:38:40.431
<v Speaker 4>You just got to have good balance and </v>
<v Speaker 4>good wrestling and you got to make sure </v>

3867
02:38:40.431 --> 02:38:41.560
<v Speaker 4>that if you get taken down that you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>pop right back up or you have good,</v>

3868
02:38:41.810 --> 02:38:42.040
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

3869
02:38:42.050 --> 02:38:47.050
<v Speaker 4>You just said the only reason they </v>
<v Speaker 4>weren't working because the only people </v>

3870
02:38:47.050 --> 02:38:47.700
<v Speaker 4>that knew how to throw all of them </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't know how to fight on the ground.</v>

3871
02:38:47.701 --> 02:38:50.960
<v Speaker 4>so we went through a dark period where </v>
<v Speaker 4>we have to take away these,</v>

3872
02:38:50.990 --> 02:38:55.990
<v Speaker 4>these techniques going to disappear for </v>
<v Speaker 4>awhile until the wrestling and the </v>

3873
02:38:55.990 --> 02:38:59.721
<v Speaker 4>striking merge as one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just so interesting to see these </v>

3874
02:38:59.721 --> 02:39:01.920
<v Speaker 4>guys that are coming up that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>throwing these games,</v>

3875
02:39:02.220 --> 02:39:07.220
<v Speaker 4>throwing these techniques at people that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you never saw like [inaudible] landon </v>

3876
02:39:07.220 --> 02:39:07.770
<v Speaker 4>that we'll kick on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Luke rockhold do.</v>

3877
02:39:07.771 --> 02:39:09.060
<v Speaker 4>They're throwing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll kicks all the time.</v>

3878
02:39:09.061 --> 02:39:12.780
<v Speaker 4>I guess like a jab.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's good even in my stryker,</v>

3879
02:39:12.810 --> 02:39:15.780
<v Speaker 4>but in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just seems that if you at least throw</v>

3880
02:39:15.781 --> 02:39:17.220
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though the heartland sometimes,</v>

3881
02:39:17.221 --> 02:39:19.320
<v Speaker 4>but you throw them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it takes a guy off his game was like,</v>

3882
02:39:19.350 --> 02:39:24.350
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy's willing to throw these </v>

3883
02:39:24.350 --> 02:39:25.491
<v Speaker 4>motherfuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See jorge mosby doll and rostom tom </v>

3884
02:39:25.491 --> 02:39:25.980
<v Speaker 4>hobby lobby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw the fight.</v>

3885
02:39:26.010 --> 02:39:27.260
<v Speaker 4>Don't remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hobby live.</v>

3886
02:39:27.280 --> 02:39:29.690
<v Speaker 4>We'll kicked him in the neck like out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>nowhere.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Take it man.</v>

3889
02:39:35.310 --> 02:39:38.490
<v Speaker 4>But he caught him in the neck with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>wheel kick like out of nowhere.</v>

3890
02:39:38.491 --> 02:39:40.990
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nowhere like straight grappler.</v>

3891
02:39:42.110 --> 02:39:44.930
<v Speaker 6>That's what catches him as people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People willing to take the risks.</v>

3892
02:39:44.931 --> 02:39:46.970
<v Speaker 6>A lot of people have a lot of good </v>
<v Speaker 6>arsenals,</v>

3893
02:39:46.980 --> 02:39:49.070
<v Speaker 6>like in their tools,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're like in the fight,</v>

3894
02:39:49.080 --> 02:39:50.540
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They'll just stick to the basics.</v>

3895
02:39:50.541 --> 02:39:55.541
<v Speaker 6>Are not willing to risk it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but those people that when somebody </v>

3896
02:39:55.541 --> 02:39:55.990
<v Speaker 6>throws something spinning at you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you almost like look at him like,</v>

3897
02:39:56.150 --> 02:39:57.980
<v Speaker 6>all right bro,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this guy wants to risk everything.</v>

3898
02:39:57.981 --> 02:39:58.730
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like that.</v>

3899
02:39:58.880 --> 02:40:00.770
<v Speaker 4>Let's get after it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know you're willing to</v>

3900
02:40:00.800 --> 02:40:01.700
<v Speaker 6>throw down like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

3901
02:40:01.701 --> 02:40:04.830
<v Speaker 6>this guy's willing to risk risk trying </v>
<v Speaker 6>to knock me out and I've got a risk risk</v>

3902
02:40:04.831 --> 02:40:09.831
<v Speaker 6>something,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if you just sit back and let it </v>

3903
02:40:09.831 --> 02:40:09.831
<v Speaker 6>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're not really taking any risks.</v>

3904
02:40:09.831 --> 02:40:09.831
<v Speaker 6>You're not really getting any reward </v>
<v Speaker 6>either.</v>

3905
02:40:09.831 --> 02:40:12.440
<v Speaker 4>One thing I want to say about gsp is </v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

3906
02:40:12.441 --> 02:40:13.950
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he lost and yes</v>

3907
02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:16.530
<v Speaker 5>it was a bad decision.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just look at his face,</v>

3908
02:40:16.710 --> 02:40:21.710
<v Speaker 5>but I admired gsp for going forward,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sticking to his game plan.</v>

3909
02:40:22.441 --> 02:40:25.580
<v Speaker 5>He was throwing down the whole time he </v>
<v Speaker 5>was going forward.</v>

3910
02:40:25.590 --> 02:40:27.060
<v Speaker 5>He got rocked and he backed up a little </v>
<v Speaker 5>bit,</v>

3911
02:40:27.061 --> 02:40:30.390
<v Speaker 5>but generally in that fight he was stone</v>
<v Speaker 5>head kicks like a motherfucker.</v>

3912
02:40:30.420 --> 02:40:32.640
<v Speaker 5>He was throwing big right hand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was.</v>

3913
02:40:32.910 --> 02:40:35.130
<v Speaker 5>He's a true warrior,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ms dot proud champion.</v>

3914
02:40:35.160 --> 02:40:36.420
<v Speaker 5>It seemed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it seemed like in the.</v>

3915
02:40:36.600 --> 02:40:38.550
<v Speaker 5>It really seemed like after the first </v>
<v Speaker 5>round,</v>

3916
02:40:38.551 --> 02:40:41.250
<v Speaker 5>he already started gassing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he was breathing really heavy,</v>

3917
02:40:41.370 --> 02:40:44.490
<v Speaker 5>but he kept going forward.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You hit hard.</v>

3918
02:40:44.570 --> 02:40:44.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3919
02:40:45.940 --> 02:40:48.220
<v Speaker 6>I've kind of felt bad for him in the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the press conference,</v>

3920
02:40:48.580 --> 02:40:50.770
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's no taken away gsp that he's not,</v>

3921
02:40:50.771 --> 02:40:51.650
<v Speaker 6>he's not a gamer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that he's,</v>

3922
02:40:51.720 --> 02:40:54.110
<v Speaker 6>he's willing to do what it takes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

3923
02:40:54.170 --> 02:40:55.840
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he almost seemed like he's just like,</v>

3924
02:40:55.841 --> 02:40:56.500
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3925
02:40:56.501 --> 02:40:57.730
<v Speaker 6>he doesn't really care.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's just like,</v>

3926
02:40:57.910 --> 02:40:58.360
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>

<v Speaker 7>You man,</v>

3939
02:41:14.131 --> 02:41:19.131
<v Speaker 7>there's a lot of insensitivity in how </v>
<v Speaker 7>people view fights and fighters after </v>

3940
02:41:19.131 --> 02:41:20.100
<v Speaker 7>fights happen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 7>I've seen guys come.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

3942
02:41:21.920 --> 02:41:25.140
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've seen guys come up to people and say</v>

3943
02:41:25.141 --> 02:41:26.310
<v Speaker 7>rude shit to them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

3945
02:41:27.990 --> 02:41:32.940
<v Speaker 7>like I've seen guys say that and it's </v>
<v Speaker 7>just like rashad evans was talking about</v>

3946
02:41:32.941 --> 02:41:37.941
<v Speaker 7>some dude who came up to him at an </v>
<v Speaker 7>autograph signing and try to get him to </v>

3947
02:41:37.941 --> 02:41:38.520
<v Speaker 7>autograph a picture of him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3948

<v Speaker 7>that famous picture of him after machida</v>
<v Speaker 7>knocked him out.</v>

3949
02:41:41.400 --> 02:41:46.400
<v Speaker 7>He got stuck in his face like smile and </v>
<v Speaker 7>laugh and they make you autograph this </v>

3950
02:41:46.400 --> 02:41:50.330

3951
02:41:50.330 --> 02:41:52.411
<v Speaker 7>get the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like rudeness and not respecting the </v>

3952
02:41:52.411 --> 02:41:57.051
<v Speaker 7>fact that this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they think that it's because he gets </v>

3953
02:41:57.051 --> 02:41:59.031
<v Speaker 7>paid for it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He should be able to deal with your </v>

3954
02:41:59.031 --> 02:41:59.031
<v Speaker 7>douche.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Baggery a man,</v>

3955
02:41:59.031 --> 02:42:00.330
<v Speaker 7>he's a public guy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Isn't a public guy.</v>

3956
02:42:01.160 --> 02:42:02.390
<v Speaker 6>Classless attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

3957
02:42:02.420 --> 02:42:04.010
<v Speaker 6>That this is horrible.</v>

3958
02:42:04.190 --> 02:42:09.190
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sports fans are used to talking shit </v>

3959
02:42:09.190 --> 02:42:11.891
<v Speaker 7>about athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They've always done it with baseball </v>

3960
02:42:11.891 --> 02:42:14.711
<v Speaker 7>players.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They've always done it with football </v>

3961
02:42:14.711 --> 02:42:14.711
<v Speaker 7>players.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a big part of a basketball games.</v>

3962
02:42:14.711 --> 02:42:19.331
<v Speaker 7>People behind this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the basket talking shit to the player </v>

3963
02:42:19.331 --> 02:42:20.660
<v Speaker 7>while he's shooting a three pointer,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3964
02:42:20.720 --> 02:42:22.340
<v Speaker 7>talking shit wise on the free throw </v>
<v Speaker 7>line,</v>

3965
02:42:22.490 --> 02:42:25.910
<v Speaker 7>given them those fucking things like </v>
<v Speaker 7>blocking them in front of his face.</v>

3966
02:42:26.050 --> 02:42:26.400
<v Speaker 7>I think that's.</v>

3967
02:42:26.920 --> 02:42:29.280
<v Speaker 5>It is kind of funny,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's a difference.</v>

3968
02:42:32.550 --> 02:42:37.550
<v Speaker 7>They need to understand and appreciate </v>
<v Speaker 7>the difference between the loss in that </v>

3969
02:42:37.550 --> 02:42:42.411
<v Speaker 7>sport.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a shitty feeling to lose a </v>

3970
02:42:42.411 --> 02:42:44.571
<v Speaker 7>basketball game and I lost an mma fight </v>
<v Speaker 7>which is a life changing proposition now</v>

3971
02:42:44.791 --> 02:42:49.791
<v Speaker 7>you're in a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 7>categories as far as your expectations </v>

3972
02:42:49.791 --> 02:42:50.940
<v Speaker 7>for your future.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You have to rebuild.</v>

3973
02:42:50.941 --> 02:42:51.120
<v Speaker 7>you have to.</v>

3974
02:42:51.290 --> 02:42:56.290
<v Speaker 6>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>really think like the other day when I </v>

3975
02:42:56.290 --> 02:42:58.860
<v Speaker 6>actually was in the float lab and </v>
<v Speaker 6>actually by the way I got some shirts </v>

3976
02:42:58.860 --> 02:42:59.350
<v Speaker 6>for in the car.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did you like that?</v>

3977
02:42:59.440 --> 02:43:04.440
<v Speaker 6>That was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're talking about this journey that </v>

3978
02:43:04.440 --> 02:43:07.351
<v Speaker 6>people deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like people use a lot of meditation and </v>

3979
02:43:07.351 --> 02:43:09.400
<v Speaker 6>I thought that float lab just like I </v>
<v Speaker 6>just re redid all my finances.</v>

3980
02:43:09.401 --> 02:43:11.920
<v Speaker 6>I just redid my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then I just took.</v>

3981
02:43:11.950 --> 02:43:13.740
<v Speaker 6>I just went on this freaking trip where </v>
<v Speaker 6>I was just.</v>

3982
02:43:14.020 --> 02:43:17.200
<v Speaker 6>I felt like something was pulling me out</v>
<v Speaker 6>of things and I was like,</v>

3983
02:43:17.230 --> 02:43:18.710
<v Speaker 6>I was just dealing with so much out of </v>
<v Speaker 6>there,</v>

3984
02:43:18.711 --> 02:43:23.711
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like mentally and are distinct that </v>

3985
02:43:23.711 --> 02:43:23.711
<v Speaker 6>some,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some people you know,</v>

3986
02:43:23.711 --> 02:43:27.121
<v Speaker 6>like when you get setbacks like that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some people dig deep and come through </v>

3987
02:43:27.121 --> 02:43:27.121
<v Speaker 6>some,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some,</v>

3988
02:43:27.121 --> 02:43:29.490
<v Speaker 6>some groundbreaking news like in their,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in their mind where they'll,</v>

3989
02:43:29.530 --> 02:43:30.250
<v Speaker 6>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they'll change,</v>

3990
02:43:30.251 --> 02:43:31.810
<v Speaker 6>but then some people just stick to that </v>
<v Speaker 6>pattern,</v>

3991
02:43:31.811 --> 02:43:32.830
<v Speaker 6>ended up falling off,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

3992
02:43:33.230 --> 02:43:38.230
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well there's the reality of self </v>

3993
02:43:38.230 --> 02:43:41.261
<v Speaker 7>examination is that you don't always </v>
<v Speaker 7>like what you see and you can either </v>

3994
02:43:41.261 --> 02:43:44.471
<v Speaker 7>change it or you could just ignore it </v>
<v Speaker 7>because it's too much work and you get </v>

3995
02:43:44.471 --> 02:43:46.400
<v Speaker 7>tired or you get into that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 7>deflecting mindset with fetus,</v>

3996
02:43:46.970 --> 02:43:48.470
<v Speaker 7>the fetus,</v>
<v Speaker 7>elitist attitude.</v>

3997
02:43:48.710 --> 02:43:51.980
<v Speaker 7>And a lot of alcoholics get that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They just keep getting back on the wagon</v>

3998
02:43:51.981 --> 02:43:54.230
<v Speaker 7>or they keep getting back drank and they</v>
<v Speaker 7>can't help it.</v>

3999
02:43:54.420 --> 02:43:55.760
<v Speaker 7>That,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that happens all the time.</v>

4000
02:43:55.840 --> 02:43:57.350
<v Speaker 7>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they can't,</v>

4001
02:43:57.351 --> 02:43:58.410
<v Speaker 7>they're not strong enough to pull,</v>

4002
02:43:58.500 --> 02:44:00.870
<v Speaker 6>pull through and it's too much work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's hard,</v>

4003
02:44:00.930 --> 02:44:02.610
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the thing is,</v>

4004
02:44:02.670 --> 02:44:05.370
<v Speaker 6>it's 80 percent mental and 20 percent </v>
<v Speaker 6>physical.</v>

4005
02:44:05.371 --> 02:44:09.480
<v Speaker 6>I really think that you have to have </v>
<v Speaker 6>your mindset to the top peak if you're,</v>

4006
02:44:09.481 --> 02:44:10.980
<v Speaker 6>if you're going to compete and do stuff </v>
<v Speaker 6>like that,</v>

4007
02:44:10.981 --> 02:44:12.570
<v Speaker 6>because if you're going in there with </v>
<v Speaker 6>like a,</v>

4008
02:44:12.930 --> 02:44:13.500
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4009
02:44:13.501 --> 02:44:15.720
<v Speaker 6>maybe something going on right at home </v>
<v Speaker 6>or you know,</v>

4010
02:44:15.810 --> 02:44:17.550
<v Speaker 6>just anything,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe the family members die,</v>

4011
02:44:17.560 --> 02:44:19.920
<v Speaker 6>maybe just something ain't going right </v>
<v Speaker 6>and you go into a fight,</v>

4012
02:44:19.921 --> 02:44:20.300
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

4013
02:44:20.301 --> 02:44:22.230
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that wears and tears on you mentally.</v>

4014
02:44:22.231 --> 02:44:23.190
<v Speaker 6>And it's mentally taxing.</v>

4015
02:44:23.470 --> 02:44:28.470
<v Speaker 7>Been the toughest fight for you to go </v>
<v Speaker 7>into because you've gotten into fights </v>

4016
02:44:28.470 --> 02:44:28.470
<v Speaker 7>with like legal issues hanging over your</v>
<v Speaker 7>head.</v>

4017
02:44:28.470 --> 02:44:30.380
<v Speaker 7>You've gotten into fights with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 7>bullshit going on with that.</v>

4018
02:44:30.710 --> 02:44:33.480
<v Speaker 6>That'd probably be the other part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In what the eaves edwards fight,</v>

4019
02:44:33.870 --> 02:44:35.580
<v Speaker 6>which is where I got clipped.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>

4020
02:44:35.581 --> 02:44:36.600
<v Speaker 6>I told you before,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

4021
02:44:36.630 --> 02:44:37.320
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel like a,</v>

4022
02:44:37.890 --> 02:44:40.130
<v Speaker 6>like a young,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like young specimen and,</v>

4023
02:44:40.131 --> 02:44:41.760
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can take anything,</v>

4024
02:44:41.761 --> 02:44:42.990
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

4025
02:44:42.991 --> 02:44:47.991
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the gym I was actually working on my </v>

4026
02:44:47.991 --> 02:44:47.991
<v Speaker 6>athleticism.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was feeling a lot more better,</v>

4027
02:44:47.991 --> 02:44:52.161
<v Speaker 6>I was a lot lighter on my feet and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>when I went to that fight all stressed </v>

4028
02:44:52.161 --> 02:44:52.161
<v Speaker 6>out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I felt like the old me,</v>

4029
02:44:52.161 --> 02:44:52.920
<v Speaker 6>I was just all drugged up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was tight,</v>

4030
02:44:52.921 --> 02:44:55.500
<v Speaker 6>I was just going for it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And there was just really no excuses.</v>

4031
02:44:55.501 --> 02:44:57.000
<v Speaker 6>That's my style of fighting is a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is uh,</v>

4032
02:44:57.001 --> 02:44:58.950
<v Speaker 6>I'm willing to risk it to get,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4033
02:44:58.951 --> 02:45:00.510
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to make bank bro,</v>

4034
02:45:00.600 --> 02:45:01.890
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>

4035
02:45:02.250 --> 02:45:04.260
<v Speaker 6>and I was going into that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's not a clear head.</v>

4036
02:45:04.261 --> 02:45:07.200
<v Speaker 6>I didn't have my head on my shoulders </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I was just gunning for it,</v>

4037
02:45:07.260 --> 02:45:08.370
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I needed the money.</v>

4038
02:45:08.371 --> 02:45:10.650
<v Speaker 6>Like I just felt like I just got robbed </v>
<v Speaker 6>of so much.</v>

4039
02:45:10.680 --> 02:45:13.050
<v Speaker 6>I got robbed in my freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got robbed them,</v>

4040
02:45:13.051 --> 02:45:15.720
<v Speaker 6>like my,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my kids putting food on the table for my</v>

4041
02:45:15.721 --> 02:45:16.590
<v Speaker 6>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

4042
02:45:16.800 --> 02:45:17.220
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

4043
02:45:17.221 --> 02:45:18.350
<v Speaker 6>this isn't right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4044
02:45:18.800 --> 02:45:23.800
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you had some sort of illegal situation </v>

4045
02:45:23.800 --> 02:45:23.800
<v Speaker 7>where somebody accused of assault and</v>

4046
02:45:23.800 --> 02:45:27.670
<v Speaker 6>it was just someone accused me of </v>
<v Speaker 6>basically just assaulting them and </v>

4047
02:45:27.670 --> 02:45:27.670
<v Speaker 6>beating them like real bad,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess.</v>

4048
02:45:27.670 --> 02:45:28.730
<v Speaker 6>Like the person had like stopped </v>
<v Speaker 6>breathing,</v>

4049
02:45:29.290 --> 02:45:29.870
<v Speaker 6>but the,</v>

4050
02:45:30.230 --> 02:45:32.790
<v Speaker 7>are they missing identity or a mistaken </v>
<v Speaker 7>identity case?</v>

4051
02:45:32.930 --> 02:45:37.930
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was just a classic fact that I had </v>

4052
02:45:37.930 --> 02:45:37.930
<v Speaker 6>through an after party at like a smaller</v>
<v Speaker 6>bar.</v>

4053
02:45:37.930 --> 02:45:40.730
<v Speaker 6>And to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't even see a fight break out in a</v>

4054
02:45:40.731 --> 02:45:43.640
<v Speaker 6>fight had broken out and it carried on </v>
<v Speaker 6>outside.</v>

4055
02:45:44.030 --> 02:45:45.560
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was,</v>

4056
02:45:45.561 --> 02:45:50.561
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was a miscommunication was with </v>

4057
02:45:50.561 --> 02:45:53.081
<v Speaker 6>people I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the bar owner was trying to kick </v>

4058
02:45:53.081 --> 02:45:54.020
<v Speaker 6>this drunk guy out who from what I know </v>
<v Speaker 6>he was at the bar.</v>

4059
02:45:54.050 --> 02:45:55.340
<v Speaker 6>He got kicked away from the bar and he's</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

4060
02:45:55.341 --> 02:45:57.500
<v Speaker 6>give me my credit card.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he's just being disrespectful,</v>

4061
02:45:57.530 --> 02:45:58.970
<v Speaker 6>groping on women,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4062
02:45:58.971 --> 02:46:03.971
<v Speaker 6>just being obnoxious,</v>
<v Speaker 6>drunk guy needed to go home and just </v>

4063
02:46:03.971 --> 02:46:04.440
<v Speaker 6>take a chill pill.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Will keep in mind this guys like in the,</v>

4064
02:46:04.450 --> 02:46:05.460
<v Speaker 6>in the army,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4065
02:46:05.520 --> 02:46:06.200
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's,</v>

4066
02:46:06.410 --> 02:46:11.410
<v Speaker 6>he's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>somebody you think that you would look </v>

4067
02:46:11.410 --> 02:46:11.410
<v Speaker 6>up to or had some of respect and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he just gets,</v>

4068
02:46:11.420 --> 02:46:11.960
<v Speaker 6>gets drunk.</v>

4069
02:46:11.960 --> 02:46:16.960
<v Speaker 6>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The bartender kicks him out and then he </v>

4070
02:46:16.960 --> 02:46:16.960
<v Speaker 6>ends up like kicking the owner and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>nuts for trying to get them out,</v>

4071
02:46:16.960 --> 02:46:21.780
<v Speaker 6>punch some dude actually.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the dude had hit him back and like </v>

4072
02:46:21.780 --> 02:46:22.890
<v Speaker 6>self defense than he had kicked the </v>
<v Speaker 6>owner and the knots gets,</v>

4073
02:46:22.940 --> 02:46:24.710
<v Speaker 6>gets thrown out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So they're like,</v>

4074
02:46:24.711 --> 02:46:26.030
<v Speaker 6>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is like a private party.</v>

4075
02:46:26.031 --> 02:46:26.960
<v Speaker 6>You got,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you got to leave.</v>

4076
02:46:26.961 --> 02:46:31.961
<v Speaker 6>He starts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he starts getting into it with another </v>

4077
02:46:31.961 --> 02:46:32.760
<v Speaker 6>guy and then that's when it happened to </v>
<v Speaker 6>be my after party from,</v>

4078
02:46:32.770 --> 02:46:36.200
<v Speaker 6>from a fight that I had and that's where</v>
<v Speaker 6>my name had got got brought up.</v>

4079
02:46:36.201 --> 02:46:41.201
<v Speaker 6>And I was actually uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I actually called down to the police </v>

4080
02:46:41.201 --> 02:46:41.201
<v Speaker 6>station the next day was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

4081
02:46:41.201 --> 02:46:42.530
<v Speaker 6>I heard you guys were looking for me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

4082
02:46:42.531 --> 02:46:44.000
<v Speaker 6>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

4083
02:46:44.001 --> 02:46:44.680
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>

4084
02:46:44.760 --> 02:46:49.760
<v Speaker 6>my management team was there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He actually seen the fight and he knew </v>

4085
02:46:49.760 --> 02:46:50.300
<v Speaker 6>he knew a lot about what was going on.</v>

4086
02:46:50.300 --> 02:46:55.300
<v Speaker 6>So we were just like being proactive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you didn't have anything to do with </v>

4087
02:46:55.300 --> 02:46:55.300
<v Speaker 6>it at all?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

4088
02:46:55.300 --> 02:46:56.010
<v Speaker 6>nothing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't even see a fight even break out</v>

4089
02:46:56.040 --> 02:46:59.150
<v Speaker 6>or the fact that the dude got knocked </v>
<v Speaker 6>the fuck out and he thought you did it.</v>

4090
02:46:59.200 --> 02:47:00.740
<v Speaker 6>He got,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess he got beat bad.</v>

4091
02:47:00.741 --> 02:47:03.200
<v Speaker 6>And like then people were like </v>
<v Speaker 6>mentioning my name.</v>

4092
02:47:03.201 --> 02:47:07.760
<v Speaker 6>It was my party and the guy who actually</v>
<v Speaker 6>did it turned himself in to the police.</v>

4093
02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:08.930
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what a trip.</v>

4094
02:47:08.970 --> 02:47:13.970
<v Speaker 6>So I ended up getting in trouble like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>almost a year later for something I </v>

4095
02:47:13.970 --> 02:47:18.521
<v Speaker 6>completely didn't do and I was actually </v>
<v Speaker 6>in des moines and was calling down to </v>

4096
02:47:18.521 --> 02:47:18.860
<v Speaker 6>see if I needed to be questioned.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're like,</v>

4097
02:47:18.861 --> 02:47:21.140
<v Speaker 6>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's nothing to be questioned here.</v>

4098
02:47:21.170 --> 02:47:26.170
<v Speaker 6>So it was just something that you were </v>
