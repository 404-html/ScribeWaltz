<v Speaker 2>And then you've been there back and</v>
<v Speaker 2>forth ever since.</v>

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The the first time I would say it wasn't</v>

4
00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:13.350
<v Speaker 2>until my flight back that I felt that</v>
<v Speaker 2>initial like I gotta do something</v>

5
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.430
<v Speaker 2>because whenever I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem just seems so huge.</v>

6
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.120
<v Speaker 2>And so I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so insurmountable that what am I going</v>

7
00:00:20.121 --> 00:00:22.080
<v Speaker 2>to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How am I going to help?</v>

8
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

9
00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:26.040
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and am I going to get endanger myself or</v>

10
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.020
<v Speaker 2>get sick or die or whatever in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>

11
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and but on the way back I just felt</v>

12
00:00:31.171 --> 00:00:31.950
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

13
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:32.783
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

14
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.190
<v Speaker 2>if not me then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then who,</v>

15
00:00:35.191 --> 00:00:36.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they asked me if I would give them</v>

16
00:00:36.691 --> 00:00:38.250
<v Speaker 2>a voice if I can help them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I could.</v>

17
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.320
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just felt,</v>

18
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.850
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a yearning,</v>

19
00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:44.490
<v Speaker 2>a longing that I had to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

20
00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:45.324
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>

21
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.220
<v Speaker 2>the second trip back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

22
00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:48.450
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was great.</v>

23
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.660
<v Speaker 2>I got to actually meet some people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>really had some real plans.</v>

24
00:00:51.661 --> 00:00:54.450
<v Speaker 2>Cause the first time I went with people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we didn't have plans to actually</v>

25
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.040
<v Speaker 2>help or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

26
00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.030
<v Speaker 2>like sustainability was just kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning trip going and seeing what the</v>

27
00:01:01.031 --> 00:01:03.320
<v Speaker 2>problems were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Second time it was the university,</v>

28
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.580
<v Speaker 2>their uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their school of community development</v>

29
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.580
<v Speaker 2>and they had dreams of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of giving them water,</v>

30
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.140
<v Speaker 2>given them land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>giving them food,</v>

31
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.030
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't have any way to do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>

32
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.650
<v Speaker 2>They had the plan and everything in</v>
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>

33
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.320
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't have funding behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have the technology behind</v>

34
00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:17.300
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

35
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.520
<v Speaker 2>and so the third time was whenever I</v>
<v Speaker 2>came back and I had studied how to build</v>

36
00:01:23.461 --> 00:01:25.620
<v Speaker 2>those eco domes and I partnered with an</v>
<v Speaker 2>organization,</v>

37
00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:28.260
<v Speaker 2>it's a great organization called water</v>
<v Speaker 2>for and they,</v>

38
00:01:28.261 --> 00:01:30.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're big thing is what,</v>

39
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:33.930
<v Speaker 2>what I was searching for was how to put</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

40
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.580
<v Speaker 2>the tools are basically the power in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hands of the people there instead of</v>

41
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.850
<v Speaker 2>having to have outside help,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can we actually help them to</v>

42
00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:43.740
<v Speaker 2>continue to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>continue the process.</v>

43
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.240
<v Speaker 2>And so water four puts the tools in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's hands and then they teach them</v>

44
00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:50.430
<v Speaker 2>how to do it and then now they can do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>for themselves.</v>

45
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.920
<v Speaker 2>It can be a sustainable business forum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can,</v>

46
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.980
<v Speaker 2>they can use whatever model they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's a nonprofit model,</v>

47
00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:57.930
<v Speaker 2>if it's a business model,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

48
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.300
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make it sustainable there so that way</v>

49
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.930
<v Speaker 2>yet where I'm at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Congolese can help Congolese in that</v>

50
00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:06.090
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can hopefully,</v>

51
00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:07.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fan the flame,</v>

52
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.000
<v Speaker 2>go over there to teach a more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring over the right people water if</v>

53
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.620
<v Speaker 2>we're really supported and sent over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

54
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their director of implementation to come</v>

55
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.120
<v Speaker 2>really sit down with us for two weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>teach us,</v>

56
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.770
<v Speaker 2>he came back out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did it again.</v>

57
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.050
<v Speaker 2>Now he's gone over since I've been back</v>
<v Speaker 2>already,</v>

58
00:02:22.051 --> 00:02:23.910
<v Speaker 2>he's been back over teaching her team</v>
<v Speaker 2>and more,</v>

59
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strategies of how to dig these water</v>

60
00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:26.440
<v Speaker 2>wells</v>

61
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.660
<v Speaker 1>and I wished it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was one parent that I could just</v>

62
00:02:28.661 --> 00:02:30.250
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the good one and the other one's</v>

63
00:02:30.251 --> 00:02:31.120
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

64
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.320
<v Speaker 1>My mom would like throw hot water and my</v>
<v Speaker 1>pops and I'd be like,</v>

65
00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:38.350
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

66
00:02:38.351 --> 00:02:39.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would do his team,</v>

67
00:02:39.871 --> 00:02:43.120
<v Speaker 1>I smack or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she tried to punch him and then</v>

68
00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:46.540
<v Speaker 1>he'd hit her and I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is wwf in the crib.</v>

69
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.780
<v Speaker 1>I got a friend who still fights with his</v>
<v Speaker 1>wife and his wife threw a fucking</v>

70
00:02:49.781 --> 00:02:52.120
<v Speaker 1>screwdriver at him and stuck him in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>arm,</v>

71
00:02:52.121 --> 00:02:55.120
<v Speaker 1>like it's stuck out of his arm and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked her that night.</v>

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.690
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

78

<v Speaker 1>So he took his pants down and it was</v>

<v Speaker 1>He took his pants down and put his ass</v>

80
00:03:10.861 --> 00:03:13.360

<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>She woke up and he farted right in her</v>

82
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:17.074
