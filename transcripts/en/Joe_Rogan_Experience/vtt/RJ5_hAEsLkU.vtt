1
00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.830
<v Speaker 1>The infamous Jamie double finger gun and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're live.</v>

2
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:06.790
<v Speaker 1>How are you sir?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

3
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.130
<v Speaker 1>Seeing that it's coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking healthy.</v>

4
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.430
<v Speaker 1>Looking fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I stopped eating meat since I last </v>

5
00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:16.670
<v Speaker 1>saw I heard about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to you about that.</v>

6
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.040
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that</v>

7
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.810
<v Speaker 2>correlating with health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

8
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.930
<v Speaker 2>every time I worry about this out loud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get hate mail from vegans and </v>

9
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:25.090
<v Speaker 2>vegetarians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say stop,</v>

10
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.290
<v Speaker 1>you start putting your bullshit on us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you,</v>

11
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.390
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't like when you associate any </v>

12
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.041
<v Speaker 1>negative consequences whatsoever with </v>
<v Speaker 1>only in vegetables because it's because </v>

13
00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:40.330
<v Speaker 1>it's essentially a cult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a wonderful cult of people that </v>

14
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.180
<v Speaker 1>want to take care of animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be nice to animals,</v>

15
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.000
<v Speaker 1>but they're very tribal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very tribal,</v>

16
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:49.001
<v Speaker 1>very cult like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you say anything that's negative </v>

17
00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:49.001
<v Speaker 1>against Vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they gang up.</v>

18
00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:52.520
<v Speaker 1>I go to forums and I read the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>they say they organize like little troll</v>

19
00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:56.210
<v Speaker 1>attacks and they make youtube videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of hilarious,</v>

20
00:00:56.211 --> 00:00:57.890
<v Speaker 1>like from a psychological standpoint.</v>

21
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

22
00:00:58.831 --> 00:01:03.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously I don't want it to become a </v>

23
00:01:03.831 --> 00:01:03.831
<v Speaker 2>new religion or my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my one religion,</v>

24
00:01:03.831 --> 00:01:08.601
<v Speaker 2>but there is a moral high ground to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>position that I find very attractive </v>

25
00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:12.690
<v Speaker 2>because I felt like a hypocrite as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mediator now.</v>

26
00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:17.691
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think there's necessarily </v>

27
00:01:17.691 --> 00:01:17.691
<v Speaker 2>extends to someone like you who hunts </v>
<v Speaker 2>and feels okay about hunting.</v>

28
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't have an argument against </v>

29
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.940
<v Speaker 2>hunting the way I do against factory </v>
<v Speaker 2>farming or,</v>

30
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.390
<v Speaker 2>or more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more or less any of the way we get meat.</v>

31
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

32
00:01:28.981 --> 00:01:31.290
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the environmental implications of it,</v>

33
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.770
<v Speaker 2>but it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it is very captivating as a position </v>

34
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:39.030
<v Speaker 2>and you feel like an ass and when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you,</v>

35
00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:44.031
<v Speaker 2>once you go far enough into the inquiry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel like an asshole not being </v>

36
00:01:44.031 --> 00:01:48.951
<v Speaker 2>sensitive to these concerns and just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm ignoring how you're getting your </v>

37
00:01:48.951 --> 00:01:50.460
<v Speaker 2>food three times a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

38
00:01:50.461 --> 00:01:53.110
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not yet for me.</v>

39
00:01:53.111 --> 00:01:58.111
<v Speaker 2>I maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's individual variation </v>

40
00:01:58.111 --> 00:02:00.171
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not the smartest vegetarian in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world in terms of how I prepare my </v>

41
00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:03.630
<v Speaker 2>food and how attentive I am to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the onus is somewhat on me,</v>

42
00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:05.310
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

43
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not totally sure it's uh,</v>

44
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.450
<v Speaker 2>the healthiest thing for me so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

45
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.890
<v Speaker 2>so you say this started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said you look healthy.</v>

46
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.910
<v Speaker 2>Mbi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like my health is somewhat with </v>

47
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.910
<v Speaker 2>reign under this has been about nine </v>
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>

48
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Weathering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

49
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.990
<v Speaker 1>are you getting your blood checked?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are You doing year 12 supplementation?</v>

50
00:02:23.991 --> 00:02:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's essential oils.</v>

51
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.370
<v Speaker 1>Essential [inaudible] is essential as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

52
00:02:28.371 --> 00:02:30.410
<v Speaker 1>Most people are just not going to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough from the sun.</v>

53
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.490
<v Speaker 1>And are you monitoring your intake of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fatty acids and things along those </v>

54
00:02:36.891 --> 00:02:39.710
<v Speaker 1>lines?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really beyond the supplementation.</v>

55
00:02:39.711 --> 00:02:40.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

56
00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:42.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get the food in.</v>

57
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's good.</v>

58
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.440
<v Speaker 1>It's all good stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really important,</v>

59
00:02:45.441 --> 00:02:49.310
<v Speaker 1>like one of the things that people rage </v>
<v Speaker 1>against,</v>

60
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.000
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the stigma and it's fats,</v>

61
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.390
<v Speaker 1>it's dietary cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dietary cholesterol and saturated fats </v>

62
00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>which are critical for hormone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's one</v>

63
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 3>of the reasons why people when they get </v>
<v Speaker 3>an all vegetable diet,</v>

64
00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:04.120
<v Speaker 3>if you're not really careful with </v>
<v Speaker 3>coconut oil,</v>

65
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:07.350
<v Speaker 3>you got to eat a lot of coconut oil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big fan of Avocados.</v>

66
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 3>I eat a lot of Avocados,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of avocado oil,</v>

67
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.550
<v Speaker 3>coconut oil as well though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almond butter,</v>

68
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.550
<v Speaker 3>nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things on those lines like you,</v>

69
00:03:14.551 --> 00:03:16.510
<v Speaker 3>you really need to get those essential </v>
<v Speaker 3>fats.</v>

70
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.060
<v Speaker 3>Well actually I'm not Vegan so I would </v>
<v Speaker 3>like to be Vegan,</v>

71
00:03:19.061 --> 00:03:21.290
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm still eating dairy.</v>

72
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.260
<v Speaker 3>And did you say you would like to be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's holding you.</v>

73
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.630
<v Speaker 3>No one's holding you down to Goddammit </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sam,</v>

74
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:27.470
<v Speaker 3>you need to have some milk?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

75
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.270
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think just.</v>

76
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.330
<v Speaker 3>I think I would screw it up again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to reap the whirlwind when </v>

77
00:03:33.521 --> 00:03:35.830
<v Speaker 3>from the Vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I should've brought you some eggs,</v>

78
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.970
<v Speaker 3>but I eat eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I eat eggs and a,</v>

79
00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.050
<v Speaker 3>but as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can only eat so many eggs and,</v>

80
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.900
<v Speaker 3>and so much dairy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I eat a lot of eggs.</v>

81
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.890
<v Speaker 3>The eggs are very good for you too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the,</v>

82
00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.220
<v Speaker 3>there's another thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dietary cholesterol,</v>

83
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.950
<v Speaker 3>like people are always concerned with </v>
<v Speaker 3>dietary cholesterol.</v>

84
00:03:50.951 --> 00:03:55.951
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a big myth for the longest </v>

85
00:03:55.951 --> 00:03:55.951
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As a matter of fact,</v>

86
00:03:55.951 --> 00:03:57.970
<v Speaker 3>dietary cholesterol barely moves the </v>
<v Speaker 3>needle and blood lipids,</v>

87
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.280
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them people have cholesterol </v>
<v Speaker 3>issues.</v>

88
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.610
<v Speaker 3>It's sedentary lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's genetics,</v>

89
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.510
<v Speaker 3>there's all sorts of other variables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people with healthy lifestyles,</v>

90
00:04:07.511 --> 00:04:10.780
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't seem to be that dietary </v>
<v Speaker 3>cholesterol is bad for you.</v>

91
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.040
<v Speaker 3>And also it's essential for testosterone</v>
<v Speaker 3>production.</v>

92
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

93
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.080
<v Speaker 3>So I get a ton of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or not a ton,</v>

94
00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:23.890
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not trying to avoid saturated </v>
<v Speaker 3>fat.</v>

95
00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.040
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

96
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.860
<v Speaker 3>I get a fair amount of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a yard?</v>

97
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.810
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

98
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.860
<v Speaker 3>Could you raise some chickens?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

99
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.720
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not after this.</v>

100
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:39.721
<v Speaker 3>I'll take you to my house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'll show you the chicken setup we </v>

101
00:04:39.721 --> 00:04:39.721
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just got five new ones.</v>

102
00:04:39.721 --> 00:04:42.370
<v Speaker 3>We have an 18 now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them died.</v>

103
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.860
<v Speaker 3>They just fucking die sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know why.</v>

104
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.120
<v Speaker 3>Just go in the chicken coop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One's dead father time got in there with</v>

105
00:04:49.121 --> 00:04:51.160
<v Speaker 3>his side and they're getting kind of old</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

106
00:04:51.161 --> 00:04:56.161
<v Speaker 3>Some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how old the chicken lasts </v>

107
00:04:56.161 --> 00:04:56.161
<v Speaker 3>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're like pets.</v>

108
00:04:56.161 --> 00:04:57.970
<v Speaker 3>They give you food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's no negativity.</v>

109
00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.770
<v Speaker 3>I opened the door,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they come up to me,</v>

110
00:04:59.771 --> 00:05:02.350
<v Speaker 3>the run around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feed feel like there's no,</v>

111
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.360
<v Speaker 3>they're not trapped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As a matter of fact,</v>

112
00:05:04.361 --> 00:05:09.361
<v Speaker 3>they go into their pen at night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you leave it open and they wander </v>

113
00:05:09.361 --> 00:05:10.180
<v Speaker 3>around my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a big yard.</v>

114
00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:15.181
<v Speaker 3>They wander in my yard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they eat a bunch of bugs and stuff and </v>

115
00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:15.181
<v Speaker 3>then they go back inside when they want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

116
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.550
<v Speaker 3>So there's no like animal captivities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no cruelty.</v>

117
00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:21.970
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing weird going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so those eggs,</v>

118
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.040
<v Speaker 3>they're pretty much Karma free.</v>

119
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.180
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

120
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:26.350
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't doubt that.</v>

121
00:05:26.351 --> 00:05:31.351
<v Speaker 3>It's just when you read the details of </v>
<v Speaker 3>how our dairy and I mean it's near </v>

122
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.340
<v Speaker 3>arguably as bad if not worse than much </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the meat production.</v>

123
00:05:36.341 --> 00:05:38.530
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moving from eating,</v>

124
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:44.070
<v Speaker 3>eating me to being a vegetarian in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>ways is a symbolic move ethically if </v>

125
00:05:45.071 --> 00:05:46.220
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you really wanted to,</v>

126
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.750
<v Speaker 3>to not participate in the machinery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's an issue with me that's for </v>

127
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.530
<v Speaker 3>vegetarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is an issue with the how they </v>

128
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.890
<v Speaker 3>gather food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>

129
00:05:55.891 --> 00:06:00.891
<v Speaker 3>there's a giant issue that people don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to take into consideration is like </v>

130
00:06:00.891 --> 00:06:02.780
<v Speaker 3>how are they growing all this food?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How they growing all these plants.</v>

131
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:07.781
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things they're doing is </v>

132
00:06:07.781 --> 00:06:08.480
<v Speaker 3>they're displacing wildlife that chewing</v>
<v Speaker 3>up this ground in these combines,</v>

133
00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:12.110
<v Speaker 3>if you eat grain and particular combines</v>
<v Speaker 3>indiscriminately,</v>

134
00:06:12.111 --> 00:06:14.450
<v Speaker 3>just chew up all that stuff and they get</v>
<v Speaker 3>deer,</v>

135
00:06:14.451 --> 00:06:15.710
<v Speaker 3>Fonz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mice,</v>

136
00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:16.820
<v Speaker 3>rabbits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rats,</v>

137
00:06:16.821 --> 00:06:19.820
<v Speaker 3>rodents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>untold amount of bugs if you want to get</v>

138
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:23.810
<v Speaker 3>really deep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's no like being a Vegan and</v>

139
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:28.811
<v Speaker 3>being a vegetarian is most certainly </v>
<v Speaker 3>less cruel and less harmful overall,</v>

140
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.390
<v Speaker 3>but it's not Karma free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can't,</v>

141
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.900
<v Speaker 3>unless you're growing your own stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can grow all your own vegetables </v>

142
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:38.990
<v Speaker 3>and you essentially live on a small </v>
<v Speaker 3>farm,</v>

143
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:40.460
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could.</v>

144
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.150
<v Speaker 3>You could do it and really feel good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>

145
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.990
<v Speaker 3>If you're buying it in the store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're participating in factory farming.</v>

146
00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:52.991
<v Speaker 3>Whether you like it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just participating it vegetable </v>

147
00:06:52.991 --> 00:06:52.991
<v Speaker 3>farming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>

148
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.530
<v Speaker 3>There's still issues.</v>

149
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:55.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

150
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.520
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

151
00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.260
<v Speaker 2>just viewer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had this guy on my podcast boom.</v>

152
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.090
<v Speaker 2>Have a lady who's running this company </v>
<v Speaker 2>called Memphis meats,</v>

153
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.360
<v Speaker 2>which is cultured meat is a startup in </v>
<v Speaker 2>silicon.</v>

154
00:07:06.361 --> 00:07:06.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

155
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then try that.</v>

156
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.020
<v Speaker 2>I haven't tried it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

157
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:15.120
<v Speaker 2>I want to try it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a fascinating conversation </v>

158
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:15.120
<v Speaker 2>because he basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

159
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.540
<v Speaker 2>what's fascinating to me on two levels </v>
<v Speaker 2>is one is just,</v>

160
00:07:18.541 --> 00:07:23.541
<v Speaker 2>it's fascinating that we're on the cusp </v>
<v Speaker 2>of being able to produce actual </v>

161
00:07:23.541 --> 00:07:24.870
<v Speaker 2>biologically identical meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>

162
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.650
<v Speaker 2>that is totally cruelty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

163
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.530
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

164
00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:30.870
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no implication of cruelty at all</v>

165
00:07:30.871 --> 00:07:31.260
<v Speaker 2>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

166
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.070
<v Speaker 2>And you would just grow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grow this in a Vat,</v>

167
00:07:35.071 --> 00:07:39.930
<v Speaker 2>the way you brew beer essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

168
00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.130
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

169
00:07:41.131 --> 00:07:46.131
<v Speaker 2>that seems like the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's interesting psychologically </v>

170
00:07:46.131 --> 00:07:48.180
<v Speaker 2>is that people have this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this creepy feeling around it,</v>

171
00:07:48.181 --> 00:07:51.040
<v Speaker 2>which is very strange because it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you,</v>

172
00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:56.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can take the misery and death out of </v>

173
00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:56.780
<v Speaker 2>the process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

174
00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:57.990
<v Speaker 2>I can take the suffering animal out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

175
00:07:57.991 --> 00:08:00.510
<v Speaker 2>I can take the chaos of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>slaughterhouse out of it.</v>

176
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:01.800
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

177
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.650
<v Speaker 2>a cow that has been mistreated for its </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole life,</v>

178
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:08.130
<v Speaker 2>stumbling in blood and feces on the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the,</v>

179
00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the killing floor.</v>

180
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:14.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and somehow removing all of that makes </v>

181
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:15.200
<v Speaker 2>it creepy or people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

182
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.110
<v Speaker 2>They want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want,</v>

183
00:08:16.111 --> 00:08:16.970
<v Speaker 2>they want that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

184
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.730
<v Speaker 2>that's the natural way to get me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if I told you this is grown in a vat</v>

185
00:08:20.731 --> 00:08:25.731
<v Speaker 2>by a guy in a white lab coat and has no </v>
<v Speaker 2>xeno viruses and no bacteria,</v>

186
00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:26.850
<v Speaker 2>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

187
00:08:26.851 --> 00:08:31.851
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics were used to pump this thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and it's just the cells you want </v>

188
00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:35.590
<v Speaker 2>people start to just kind of an eerie </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling that,</v>

189
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.350
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I think we're going to get over.</v>

190
00:08:37.351 --> 00:08:40.320
<v Speaker 2>But it's interesting psychologically </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's there in the first place.</v>

191
00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:44.150
<v Speaker 2>Did you get that feeling or you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>know the people know?</v>

192
00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:45.840
<v Speaker 2>I hope they understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

193
00:08:45.841 --> 00:08:47.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm past it,</v>

194
00:08:47.071 --> 00:08:49.170
<v Speaker 2>but I understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who Do you know that got it,</v>

195
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:51.330
<v Speaker 2>that just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just see the reaction that,</v>

196
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I actually pulled this on twitter,</v>

197
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm at 20 percent of pay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 15,000</v>

198
00:08:56.521 --> 00:08:58.130
<v Speaker 2>people answered the poll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was like,</v>

199
00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:03.160
<v Speaker 2>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a scientifically valid poll of </v>

200
00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:03.540
<v Speaker 2>the general population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just whoever got it on my,</v>

201
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.620
<v Speaker 2>on my feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

202
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.210
<v Speaker 2>it was interesting to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

203
00:09:07.211 --> 00:09:08.340
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I asked,</v>

204
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:11.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the people who wouldn't switch,</v>

205
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.280
<v Speaker 2>I asked would you switch?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And something like 80 percent said they </v>

206
00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:16.970
<v Speaker 2>would switch if this was affordable and </v>
<v Speaker 2>available and safe.</v>

207
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of the people who wouldn't switch,</v>

208
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:25.940
<v Speaker 2>it was 25 percent wouldn't switch </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's just creepy and 25 percent </v>

209
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:30.270
<v Speaker 2>assume that it was um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a not healthy.</v>

210
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:32.430
<v Speaker 2>I think I forgot the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the for the breakdown.</v>

211
00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:37.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another 25 percent was we're already </v>

212
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:37.590
<v Speaker 2>vegan or vegetarian and didn't want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>eat meat,</v>

213
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.580
<v Speaker 2>but there was an ick factor for at least</v>
<v Speaker 2>25 percent of the people who wouldn't do</v>

214
00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:42.810
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand it.</v>

215
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.960
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how many people would go back </v>
<v Speaker 2>to eating meat if they could raise it </v>

216
00:09:48.541 --> 00:09:53.541
<v Speaker 2>this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how many people who had gone vegan </v>

217
00:09:53.541 --> 00:09:55.641
<v Speaker 2>would go back to eating this </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientifically created lab created beef?</v>

218
00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:59.540
<v Speaker 2>I think enough for a series market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

219
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.750
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

220
00:10:00.751 --> 00:10:02.820
<v Speaker 2>there'd be a serious market for it for </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

221
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
<v Speaker 2>If they could get the cost effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because last time I saw it was like </v>

222
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:08.000
<v Speaker 2>quarter million bucks for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheeseburger.</v>

223
00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:10.980
<v Speaker 2>I think it's down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's $18,000</v>

224
00:10:10.981 --> 00:10:13.910
<v Speaker 2>from me for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

225
00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.750
<v Speaker 2>it'll eventually be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

226
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:19.570
<v Speaker 2>the Apollo computers now fit in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>pocket much stronger in fact,</v>

227
00:10:19.571 --> 00:10:20.700
<v Speaker 2>than the Apollo computers.</v>

228
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:21.900
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sequencing,</v>

229
00:10:21.901 --> 00:10:22.540
<v Speaker 2>the genome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

230
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.090
<v Speaker 2>this I just noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is fascinating.</v>

231
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:27.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sequencing the genome 15 years ago,</v>

232
00:10:27.991 --> 00:10:30.930
<v Speaker 2>cost $3,000,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's now 3000,</v>

233
00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:36.660
<v Speaker 2>so it's a million fold reduction in cost</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 15 years.</v>

234
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.130
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So something like that,</v>

235
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:42.240
<v Speaker 2>things tend to scale that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

236
00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:45.030
<v Speaker 2>that's a giant scale though when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about human history,</v>

237
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.470
<v Speaker 2>that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good Lord.</v>

238
00:10:46.471 --> 00:10:51.471
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if you're a guy who spent 3 </v>
<v Speaker 2>billion of it 15 years ago and you're </v>

239
00:10:51.471 --> 00:10:51.471
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

240
00:10:51.471 --> 00:10:54.060
<v Speaker 2>if I just fucking wait here would to </v>
<v Speaker 2>saved so much money.</v>

241
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:56.790
<v Speaker 2>And that's mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't anticipate that.</v>

242
00:10:56.791 --> 00:11:00.990
<v Speaker 2>When we think of how difficult it is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>solve certain problems,</v>

243
00:11:00.991 --> 00:11:05.991
<v Speaker 2>we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is ray Kurzweil's point of </v>

244
00:11:05.991 --> 00:11:06.690
<v Speaker 2>records while who I think is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a bit of a cult leader.</v>

245
00:11:06.691 --> 00:11:10.770
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a carnival barker on many topics.</v>

246
00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:11.820
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this point,</v>

247
00:11:11.821 --> 00:11:13.770
<v Speaker 2>he makes it again and again I think is </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite valid,</v>

248
00:11:13.771 --> 00:11:18.771
<v Speaker 2>which is when you're factoring how </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult it will be to get into the end</v>

249
00:11:18.871 --> 00:11:23.871
<v Speaker 2>zone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that ends on is you're not </v>

250
00:11:23.871 --> 00:11:26.241
<v Speaker 2>tending to factor all of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>improvements and the compounding </v>

251
00:11:26.241 --> 00:11:26.241
<v Speaker 2>improvements in technology along the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

252
00:11:26.241 --> 00:11:28.080
<v Speaker 2>So I would love to get back to Ray </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kurzweil,</v>

253
00:11:28.081 --> 00:11:30.290
<v Speaker 2>but I wanted to bring up this point </v>
<v Speaker 2>about did you.</v>

254
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:35.330
<v Speaker 2>One of the things about going Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you proclaim and you go </v>

255
00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.060
<v Speaker 2>public with going Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you back out of that,</v>

256
00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.800
<v Speaker 2>that's where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where I am as a vegetarian.</v>

257
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:44.460
<v Speaker 2>They get fucking mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get mad.</v>

258
00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:49.580
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that family?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A couple that runs a bunch of Vegan </v>

259
00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:50.440
<v Speaker 2>restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

260
00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:52.410
<v Speaker 2>and they decided to start eating meat </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

261
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:53.950
<v Speaker 2>Even though they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Vegan restaurants,</v>

262
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.080
<v Speaker 1>they decided to start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have their own farm,</v>

263
00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:58.630
<v Speaker 1>they raise their own cattle and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>started eating their own cattle.</v>

264
00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:00.520
<v Speaker 1>It was real weird too because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought,</v>

265
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.680
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of Jesus in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>message,</v>

266
00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:03.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of,</v>

267
00:12:03.881 --> 00:12:08.881
<v Speaker 1>like Jesus said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're supposed to take care of the </v>

268
00:12:08.881 --> 00:12:08.881
<v Speaker 1>biblical quotes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

269
00:12:08.881 --> 00:12:10.960
<v Speaker 1>like really obscure biblical quotes </v>
<v Speaker 1>about food,</v>

270
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:11.680
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

271
00:12:11.681 --> 00:12:13.870
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what are you doing here?</v>

272
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:16.150
<v Speaker 1>But they have a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>

273
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:21.630
<v Speaker 1>Vegans were bold against owners of </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous La Vegan restaurants after meat </v>

274
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:22.760
<v Speaker 1>eating outed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

275
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.800
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you could say the outage </v>

276
00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:28.210
<v Speaker 1>because I'm pretty sure they put it on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their facebook page.</v>

277
00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.940
<v Speaker 1>Like the guy was like first cheeseburger</v>
<v Speaker 1>and 15 years.</v>

278
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.430
<v Speaker 1>Is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is cafe gratitude.</v>

279
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:34.030
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

280
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:34.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

281
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:37.090
<v Speaker 2>well the other thing that's hilarious </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that restaurant,</v>

282
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.880
<v Speaker 2>which I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The food is good,</v>

283
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:41.560
<v Speaker 2>but have you been there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

284
00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:46.730
<v Speaker 2>So everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now forgive me if this is no longer </v>

285
00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:50.041
<v Speaker 2>true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at one point every employee there </v>

286
00:12:50.041 --> 00:12:50.041
<v Speaker 2>did the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

287
00:12:50.041 --> 00:12:51.820
<v Speaker 1>the landmark forum that the successor to</v>
<v Speaker 1>asked.</v>

288
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:52.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

289
00:12:52.541 --> 00:12:55.210
<v Speaker 1>They get sued for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who gets this?</v>

290
00:12:55.211 --> 00:12:55.720
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

291
00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:58.720
<v Speaker 1>this restaurant is one of the reasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>why they closed one of the restaurants.</v>

292
00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:00.790
<v Speaker 1>Can you explain that though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because.</v>

293
00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:01.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so landmarks.</v>

294
00:13:01.991 --> 00:13:02.170
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

295
00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I've never done this.</v>

296
00:13:04.231 --> 00:13:06.330
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm speaking outside the,</v>

297
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.650
<v Speaker 2>the cult walls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

298
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:13.380
<v Speaker 2>so runner earhart was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sixties.</v>

299
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:14.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

300
00:13:14.311 --> 00:13:17.810
<v Speaker 2>human potential figure who started </v>
<v Speaker 2>asked,</v>

301
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm never met him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

302
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:21.540
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

303
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:26.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously impressive enough as a person </v>

304
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:27.420
<v Speaker 2>to get a lot of people to spend a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>time doing whatever he said.</v>

305
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:29.250
<v Speaker 2>And he had this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had this,</v>

306
00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:32.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a growth,</v>

307
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:37.560
<v Speaker 2>a course called asked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has been,</v>

308
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've seen it in many movies,</v>

309
00:13:40.861 --> 00:13:45.861
<v Speaker 2>no name comes to mind now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some version of this where you can </v>

310
00:13:45.861 --> 00:13:48.861
<v Speaker 2>keep everyone in the room and the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to ask permission to go to the </v>

311
00:13:48.861 --> 00:13:50.130
<v Speaker 2>bathroom and there's kind of like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure cooker situation socially where</v>

312
00:13:50.131 --> 00:13:55.131
<v Speaker 2>you have everyone sort of torn down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually the classic case of this,</v>

313
00:13:57.781 --> 00:14:02.781
<v Speaker 2>I think this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this wasn't ss was the forum which is </v>

314
00:14:02.781 --> 00:14:02.781
<v Speaker 2>now the successor to.</v>

315
00:14:02.781 --> 00:14:05.790
<v Speaker 2>So they were at one point hired to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>coaching,</v>

316
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:07.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

317
00:14:07.471 --> 00:14:08.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>various companies.</v>

318
00:14:08.401 --> 00:14:11.620
<v Speaker 2>And I think they're hired by the FAA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote about this in one of my books in</v>

319
00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:16.640
<v Speaker 2>a footnote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the FAA FAA hired the forum to </v>

320
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.380
<v Speaker 2>coach their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

321
00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:19.880
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

322
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:25.430
<v Speaker 2>administrators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the exercises they a force </v>

323
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:28.230
<v Speaker 2>these guys to do is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they almost certainly were mostly guys,</v>

324
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:33.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they chained the boss to his secretary </v>

325
00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:38.210
<v Speaker 2>and had for like the whole day and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>had to go to the bathroom together and </v>

326
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:38.210
<v Speaker 2>like sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

327
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:40.280
<v Speaker 2>ego annihilating experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

328
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.300
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the recipe that,</v>

329
00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.140
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

330
00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:48.150
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the recipes that asked is </v>

331
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.621
<v Speaker 2>pioneered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not to say that people don't go </v>

332
00:14:50.621 --> 00:14:50.621
<v Speaker 2>to the forum and get a lot out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

333
00:14:50.621 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 2>I've actually met those people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

<v Speaker 1>the name of everything on the menu is </v>

346
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:24.980

00:15:36.861 --> 00:15:38.910
<v Speaker 1>It's your humble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's that.</v>

352
00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.600
<v Speaker 1>That becomes a little of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That goes a long way.</v>

353
00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:45.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're retarded.</v>

354
00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:48.290
<v Speaker 1>That's what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you go to is good though.</v>

355
00:15:48.291 --> 00:15:49.100
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

356
00:15:49.101 --> 00:15:50.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get me the wrong way.</v>

357
00:15:50.151 --> 00:15:55.151
<v Speaker 1>The food is good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it makes sense then that they would </v>

358
00:15:55.151 --> 00:15:57.791
<v Speaker 1>go all Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he religiousy when they were trying to </v>

359
00:15:57.791 --> 00:15:57.791
<v Speaker 1>justify their meat consumption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

360
00:15:57.791 --> 00:15:59.680
<v Speaker 1>see soon as you pull up the quotes for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

361
00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:02.840
<v Speaker 1>a justifying their meat consumption </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was real weird.</v>

362
00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.190
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how weird is that?</v>

363
00:16:04.191 --> 00:16:09.191
<v Speaker 1>These guys are like using Jesus and </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion to justify eating cows when </v>

364
00:16:09.191 --> 00:16:10.130
<v Speaker 1>they've been a Vegan for all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

365
00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.130
<v Speaker 1>What did you not listen to Jesus all </v>
<v Speaker 1>those other years?</v>

366
00:16:13.131 --> 00:16:14.000
<v Speaker 1>Like you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you,</v>

367
00:16:14.001 --> 00:16:15.320
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not eating meat.</v>

368
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.590
<v Speaker 1>Like what was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the turnaround there?</v>

369
00:16:18.591 --> 00:16:20.390
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

370
00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:25.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can pull veganism out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Bible unless you know a.</v>

371
00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess if you go back to the garden and</v>

372
00:16:27.311 --> 00:16:28.820
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing about them eating meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

373
00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:30.740
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was all provided from the trees.</v>

374
00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:34.820
<v Speaker 1>There's no slaughterhouse in the garden </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Riparian Ism is fairly old.</v>

375
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:39.900
<v Speaker 1>Mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegetarianism has been around in Hindu </v>

376
00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:39.900
<v Speaker 1>cultures and so many different cultures </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever,</v>

377
00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:41.630
<v Speaker 1>but not veganism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

378
00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>veganism is really fairly recent.</v>

379
00:16:44.121 --> 00:16:49.121
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty impractical in history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

380
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:52.520
<v Speaker 1>Hurting remanence of our best tool to </v>
<v Speaker 1>restore fertility to the earth.</v>

381
00:16:52.521 --> 00:16:56.840
<v Speaker 1>Keep the earth covered in reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Desertification and climate change.</v>

382
00:16:56.841 --> 00:16:59.260
<v Speaker 1>He wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need cows to keep the earth alive.</v>

383
00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:01.670
<v Speaker 1>Cows make an extreme sacrifice for </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity,</v>

384
00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:05.900
<v Speaker 1>but that's their position in God's plan </v>
<v Speaker 1>as food for the predators.</v>

385
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>

386
00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:10.070
<v Speaker 1>That's a strange quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there was more of them,</v>

387
00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:11.720
<v Speaker 1>but that's good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there was.</v>

388
00:17:11.721 --> 00:17:15.740
<v Speaker 1>There was more of that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all the sudden he's a predator.</v>

389
00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:22.100
<v Speaker 1>Predators go after animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They chase him down and they kill them.</v>

390
00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:27.840
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess we're kind of predators in a </v>

391
00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.161
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're some new thing where some </v>

392
00:17:30.161 --> 00:17:30.161
<v Speaker 1>completely new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We.</v>

393
00:17:30.161 --> 00:17:34.240
<v Speaker 1>We use weapons or we corral them and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got them corralled and you just </v>

394
00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:38.291
<v Speaker 1>stick in that no country for old men </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing in their head and killing them </v>

395
00:17:38.291 --> 00:17:39.170
<v Speaker 1>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what they're doing,</v>

396
00:17:39.171 --> 00:17:40.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're doing that,</v>

397
00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:45.450
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you're allowed to call </v>

398
00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:45.450
<v Speaker 1>yourself a predator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

399
00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:47.090
<v Speaker 1>historically were predatory and chimps </v>
<v Speaker 1>are predators.</v>

400
00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.890
<v Speaker 1>Know not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not entirely,</v>

401
00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Speaker 1>but they are that</v>

402
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:50.280
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

403
00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:54.620
<v Speaker 3>We're certainly a kind of a Predator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're so much different now and this</v>

404
00:17:54.621 --> 00:17:59.621
<v Speaker 3>is what we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about factory farming and </v>

405
00:17:59.621 --> 00:18:02.660
<v Speaker 3>these weird businesses where they slam </v>
<v Speaker 3>all these animals,</v>

406
00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:07.670
<v Speaker 3>these entirely too small places and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>live in their own feces and urine and </v>

407
00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you've seen that drone footage </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the pig farm.</v>

408
00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:16.480
<v Speaker 3>I've seen a lot of pig farm footage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know if I've seen drone </v>

409
00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.941
<v Speaker 3>footage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I've seen lakes of urine </v>

410
00:18:18.941 --> 00:18:18.941
<v Speaker 3>feces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's disgusting.</v>

411
00:18:18.941 --> 00:18:19.710
<v Speaker 3>It's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

412
00:18:19.711 --> 00:18:23.600
<v Speaker 3>this guy flew this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they have these ag gag laws which</v>

413
00:18:23.601 --> 00:18:24.700
<v Speaker 3>are evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

414
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:27.200
<v Speaker 3>and if you don't know what those means,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what that means.</v>

415
00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:32.320
<v Speaker 3>Ag Gag laws are laws that they make it a</v>
<v Speaker 3>federal crime to show all of the abuse </v>

416
00:18:35.451 --> 00:18:40.451
<v Speaker 3>of these animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to show factory farming because it'll </v>

417
00:18:40.451 --> 00:18:43.871
<v Speaker 3>affect the business so drastically and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so radically when people are exposed to </v>

418
00:18:43.871 --> 00:18:46.370
<v Speaker 3>the truth that they've made it illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those laws should be illegal.</v>

419
00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.440
<v Speaker 3>Those laws are scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're scary aspect of human beings.</v>

420
00:18:49.441 --> 00:18:51.440
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen this with some toxic </v>
<v Speaker 3>lake.</v>

421
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:56.540
<v Speaker 3>It's a lake of pee and poop and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>those things are stuffed to the gills </v>

422
00:18:57.021 --> 00:18:57.710
<v Speaker 3>with pigs.</v>

423
00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:58.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a book,</v>

424
00:18:58.981 --> 00:19:00.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

425
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:03.850
<v Speaker 2>eating animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jonathan Safran [inaudible] book,</v>

426
00:19:03.851 --> 00:19:08.851
<v Speaker 2>which is worth reading if you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're immune to the details because </v>

427
00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:09.940
<v Speaker 2>it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

428
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:11.590
<v Speaker 2>there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's two aspects to it.</v>

429
00:19:11.591 --> 00:19:15.760
<v Speaker 2>There's the cruelty aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is actually three aspects.</v>

430
00:19:15.761 --> 00:19:17.530
<v Speaker 2>There's the cruelty aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is horrific.</v>

431
00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:23.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the environmental energy use </v>

432
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:24.970
<v Speaker 2>issue which has also just totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>untenable.</v>

433
00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:31.050
<v Speaker 2>And then there's just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have any concern about your own </v>

434
00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:32.410
<v Speaker 2>health and the contamination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean just,</v>

435
00:19:32.411 --> 00:19:37.411
<v Speaker 2>just the getting all these antibiotics </v>
<v Speaker 2>that weren't prescribed to you that you </v>

436
00:19:37.411 --> 00:19:40.831
<v Speaker 2>don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's still getting into you through </v>

437
00:19:40.831 --> 00:19:40.831
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this food chain.</v>

438
00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:42.730
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mean,</v>

439
00:19:42.731 --> 00:19:47.110
<v Speaker 2>just the stuff that they like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chickens,</v>

440
00:19:47.111 --> 00:19:47.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

441
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:52.430
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the details about chicken farming is </v>

442
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.710
<v Speaker 2>almost the most horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

443
00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.240
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

444
00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.850
<v Speaker 2>they're covered in just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

445
00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:58.060
<v Speaker 2>just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the foulest uh,</v>

446
00:19:58.330 --> 00:19:59.400
<v Speaker 2>no pun intended.</v>

447
00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:04.730
<v Speaker 2>Just the most disgusting material they </v>
<v Speaker 2>go into like a broth that's just like </v>

448
00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:07.830
<v Speaker 2>pure bacteria and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

449
00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:12.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean they have to be washed with just </v>
<v Speaker 2>ammonia or whatever they put on them.</v>

450
00:20:13.091 --> 00:20:18.091
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just to really wash with a moment </v>

451
00:20:18.091 --> 00:20:18.091
<v Speaker 2>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget the details,</v>

452
00:20:18.091 --> 00:20:20.230
<v Speaker 2>but it's just the read Jonathan Safran </v>
<v Speaker 2>Safran for his book on this.</v>

453
00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:20.970
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

454
00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:22.360
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

455
00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:26.860
<v Speaker 2>the details of what goes on from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chickens.</v>

456
00:20:26.861 --> 00:20:29.860
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think largely because they're so small</v>

457
00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:33.310
<v Speaker 2>and it more of the process of killing </v>
<v Speaker 2>them as automated,</v>

458
00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:35.860
<v Speaker 2>that they almost get the worst of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're,</v>

459
00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:36.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just,</v>

460
00:20:36.461 --> 00:20:41.461
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're getting singed before they're </v>

461
00:20:41.461 --> 00:20:41.461
<v Speaker 2>done before that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

462
00:20:41.461 --> 00:20:41.461
<v Speaker 2>there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just not.</v>

463
00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:43.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least with a cow,</v>

464
00:20:43.271 --> 00:20:46.600
<v Speaker 2>you've got a single person interacting </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a single cow,</v>

465
00:20:46.601 --> 00:20:47.720
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

466
00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.170
<v Speaker 2>there's less chaos and in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the machinery,</v>

467
00:20:50.171 --> 00:20:53.290
<v Speaker 2>but chicken is just get 'em pulverized.</v>

468
00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.700
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

469
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:57.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's arguably,</v>

470
00:20:57.281 --> 00:21:02.281
<v Speaker 2>that's the one of the greatest pain </v>
<v Speaker 2>points ethically comes around just just </v>

471
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:08.700
<v Speaker 2>egg industry because fully half the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chickens that the male chicks just </v>

472
00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.930
<v Speaker 2>immediately get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get thrown into a,</v>

473
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:15.990
<v Speaker 2>literally like a meat grinder because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not the same chicken that is a </v>

474
00:21:16.541 --> 00:21:17.720
<v Speaker 2>broiler chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

475
00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.120
<v Speaker 2>the genetically they're not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>

476
00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:22.600
<v Speaker 2>they don't grow into the same kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>chicken that would be useful.</v>

477
00:21:22.601 --> 00:21:23.240
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

478
00:21:23.241 --> 00:21:25.800
<v Speaker 2>they're useless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they don't lay eggs and you,</v>

479
00:21:25.801 --> 00:21:27.920
<v Speaker 2>you don't eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they just get a,</v>

480
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:32.350
<v Speaker 2>literally just fed into a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a woodchipper,</v>

481
00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:33.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alive.</v>

482
00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:35.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

483
00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:40.890
<v Speaker 2>this is in some ways an artifact of them</v>
<v Speaker 2>being so small that it would be so much </v>

484
00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:45.151
<v Speaker 2>of a Ha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just too much of a hassle to stun them </v>

485
00:21:45.151 --> 00:21:45.151
<v Speaker 2>appropriately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

486
00:21:45.151 --> 00:21:46.200
<v Speaker 1>If they had to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They made a law.</v>

487
00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:48.600
<v Speaker 1>We had to bury them all and put little </v>
<v Speaker 1>crosses in the ground.</v>

488
00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:54.060
<v Speaker 1>The labor intensive Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was like millions and billions,</v>

489
00:21:54.241 --> 00:21:59.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on the highway and there was a </v>

490
00:21:59.241 --> 00:22:00.771
<v Speaker 1>chicken truck that was passing me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those trucks that's containing </v>

491
00:22:00.771 --> 00:22:04.401
<v Speaker 1>live chickens and they just stacked to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stacked and cages on top of each other </v>

492
00:22:04.401 --> 00:22:07.890
<v Speaker 1>cage on top of cage just shitting on </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other and I'm watching this and I'm</v>

493
00:22:07.891 --> 00:22:12.891
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so weird that we're allowed to do </v>

494
00:22:12.891 --> 00:22:13.170
<v Speaker 1>that with some animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you were doing that with horses,</v>

495
00:22:13.171 --> 00:22:18.171
<v Speaker 1>people would lose their fucking minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you had dogs in boxes like that </v>

496
00:22:18.171 --> 00:22:20.460
<v Speaker 1>stacked and in the open air on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>highway and you're driving down the road</v>

497
00:22:20.461 --> 00:22:21.690
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People would freak out,</v>

498
00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.240
<v Speaker 1>but no one bats an eye at these </v>
<v Speaker 1>chickens.</v>

499
00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.970
<v Speaker 1>This chicken truck is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's chickens or weird thing.</v>

500
00:22:26.971 --> 00:22:31.971
<v Speaker 1>We have like a hierarchy of animals that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we love and we're not really big into </v>

501
00:22:31.971 --> 00:22:33.660
<v Speaker 1>reptiles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really big into birds.</v>

502
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
<v Speaker 2>It has something to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think with facial expressiveness a </v>

503
00:22:39.881 --> 00:22:44.881
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Mr Fisher also away down like the </v>

504
00:22:44.881 --> 00:22:47.551
<v Speaker 2>fact that fish have these cold </v>
<v Speaker 2>expressionless faces no matter what </v>

505
00:22:47.551 --> 00:22:47.551
<v Speaker 2>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

506
00:22:47.551 --> 00:22:48.850
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that cuts down on empathy,</v>

507
00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:54.150
<v Speaker 2>but I think its size,</v>
<v Speaker 2>its facial display and it's also the </v>

508
00:22:55.541 --> 00:22:56.560
<v Speaker 2>sounds they make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

509
00:22:56.561 --> 00:22:56.970
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

510
00:22:57.010 --> 00:23:00.040
<v Speaker 2>if a lobster could scream every time it </v>
<v Speaker 2>went to the pot,</v>

511
00:23:00.041 --> 00:23:01.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

512
00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:03.340
<v Speaker 2>it would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be a different encounter with,</v>

513
00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:08.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just how much do I want to eat this </v>

514
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.390
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

515
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:12.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so something obviously like an ape </v>

516
00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:12.420
<v Speaker 2>or something that's cute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

517
00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:17.030
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing what a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a fluffy tail will get you the </v>

518
00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:17.030
<v Speaker 2>difference between a squirrel and a rat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

519
00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:19.170
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is crazy.</v>

520
00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.060
<v Speaker 1>Squirrels could just hang out with </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

521
00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:24.040
<v Speaker 1>We're cool with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look so close to rats.</v>

522
00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:24.600
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

523
00:23:24.601 --> 00:23:27.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm so close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a hot girl sister.</v>

524
00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:29.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

525
00:23:29.581 --> 00:23:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

526
00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:35.120
<v Speaker 1>so much so close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was an article today about some </v>

527
00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.631
<v Speaker 1>woman who had rescued a lobster from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurant and dropped it off in the </v>

528
00:23:39.061 --> 00:23:44.061
<v Speaker 1>ocean and the journey of this all and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how you should think of this lobster or </v>

529
00:23:44.061 --> 00:23:46.220
<v Speaker 1>something with a cute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you did,</v>

530
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:49.220
<v Speaker 2>then you would appreciate her efforts </v>
<v Speaker 2>and understand that this lobster,</v>

531
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:52.700
<v Speaker 2>even though they're not even capable of </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling pain in lobsters,</v>

532
00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:57.830
<v Speaker 2>they don't have enough nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their nervous systems aren't strong </v>

533
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:58.220
<v Speaker 2>enough for them to feel pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have the same sort of sensors</v>

534
00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.630
<v Speaker 2>that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Allegedly.</v>

535
00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:00.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

536
00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.520
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

537
00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:03.060
<v Speaker 2>I've threatened to do this actually when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

538
00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:08.080
<v Speaker 2>When I decided to become a vegetarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said at some point maybe I will just </v>

539
00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:08.390
<v Speaker 2>do a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

540
00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:13.490
<v Speaker 2>a taxonomy of the kind of a comparative </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroanatomy across species just to see </v>

541
00:24:13.881 --> 00:24:16.340
<v Speaker 2>where we could plausibly say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

542
00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:20.620
<v Speaker 2>the suffering really begins to matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The killing anything.</v>

543
00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:21.290
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

544
00:24:21.291 --> 00:24:26.291
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are what are called by Val vegans </v>

545
00:24:26.291 --> 00:24:28.481
<v Speaker 2>who eat clams and oysters and Mussels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I could get into that because they </v>

546
00:24:28.481 --> 00:24:28.481
<v Speaker 2>think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

547
00:24:28.481 --> 00:24:33.401
<v Speaker 2>there's no way you can make an argument </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's no basis for suffering </v>

548
00:24:33.401 --> 00:24:33.401
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

549
00:24:33.401 --> 00:24:34.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's no feeling,</v>

550
00:24:34.241 --> 00:24:37.370
<v Speaker 2>there's no suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my argument against that Tau is lobsters</v>

551
00:24:37.371 --> 00:24:39.980
<v Speaker 2>are clearly not happy when you throw </v>
<v Speaker 2>them in boiling water.</v>

552
00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:43.910
<v Speaker 2>So what's that reaction?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think anything that can behave,</v>

553
00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.280
<v Speaker 2>they can move right and move away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the stimulus,</v>

554
00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:51.490
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the evolutionary rationale for it to </v>

555
00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:55.070
<v Speaker 2>experience pain on the question of </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness is difficult.</v>

556
00:24:55.071 --> 00:24:56.480
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where consciousness emerges.</v>

557
00:24:56.481 --> 00:25:01.370
<v Speaker 2>And I think there is clearly an </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscious pain mechanisms,</v>

558
00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:05.120
<v Speaker 2>the same mechanisms that give us pain at</v>
<v Speaker 2>a certain level.</v>

559
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:09.080
<v Speaker 2>We can be unconscious and yet they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>be just as effective.</v>

560
00:25:09.081 --> 00:25:10.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of our reflexes are like that.</v>

561
00:25:10.521 --> 00:25:15.521
<v Speaker 2>So you touch a hot stove,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're pulling your hand away actually </v>

562
00:25:15.521 --> 00:25:16.810
<v Speaker 2>before you consciously registering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

563
00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.400
<v Speaker 2>and that's as it should be because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're faster that way.</v>

564
00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:24.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's possible to have unconscious </v>

565
00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.071
<v Speaker 2>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anything they can move very quickly </v>

566
00:25:27.071 --> 00:25:31.961
<v Speaker 2>is going to evolve and ability to move </v>
<v Speaker 2>away from noxious stimuli and that,</v>

567
00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:35.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

568
00:25:35.991 --> 00:25:38.030
<v Speaker 2>there's every reason to make that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

569
00:25:38.031 --> 00:25:38.390
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

570
00:25:38.391 --> 00:25:43.391
<v Speaker 2>in evolutionary terms as salient and is </v>
<v Speaker 2>as urgent as possible,</v>

571
00:25:43.501 --> 00:25:46.100
<v Speaker 2>and then our pain responds is that for </v>
<v Speaker 2>us,</v>

572
00:25:46.101 --> 00:25:51.101
<v Speaker 2>and there's no reason to withhold that </v>
<v Speaker 2>from any other animal that's clearly </v>

573
00:25:51.101 --> 00:25:53.590
<v Speaker 2>avoiding stuff with all of its power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

574
00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:59.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that there's got to be </v>

575
00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.250
<v Speaker 2>all the way down to mushrooms because </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody eats mushrooms,</v>

576
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:04.640
<v Speaker 2>even vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but mushrooms breathe in oxygen and they</v>

577
00:26:04.641 --> 00:26:09.641
<v Speaker 2>breathe out carbon dioxide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're way closer to humans than they </v>

578
00:26:09.641 --> 00:26:11.000
<v Speaker 2>really are to plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're weird.</v>

579
00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:14.360
<v Speaker 2>They're a strange sort of an organism </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's been mushrooms.</v>

580
00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:17.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not necessarily like a plant.</v>

581
00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:22.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we think of them as a plan because they </v>

582
00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:22.720
<v Speaker 2>grow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're a fungus.</v>

583
00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.280
<v Speaker 2>It's a type of life form and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>interlink through the mycelium.</v>

584
00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.980
<v Speaker 2>It will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terence Mckenna.</v>

585
00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.630
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you got him talking on mushrooms long</v>

586
00:26:29.631 --> 00:26:30.620
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would,</v>

587
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:35.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very spooky stuff that he thought </v>

588
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:35.870
<v Speaker 2>about them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's no nervous system there.</v>

589
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:39.240
<v Speaker 2>I think the crucial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

590
00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.340
<v Speaker 2>variable is the complexity of a nervous </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

591
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:47.220
<v Speaker 2>So suffering and pain and emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

592
00:26:47.221 --> 00:26:47.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just when you're,</v>

593
00:26:47.971 --> 00:26:51.600
<v Speaker 2>when you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's suffering is one component of</v>

594
00:26:51.601 --> 00:26:56.601
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then there's just the question of </v>

595
00:26:56.601 --> 00:26:57.790
<v Speaker 2>what sort of experience can this </v>
<v Speaker 2>creature be deprived?</v>

596
00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:59.520
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you ask like,</v>

597
00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:02.770
<v Speaker 2>why is it a tragedy or why would it be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>tragedy to,</v>

598
00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:06.540
<v Speaker 2>to kill someone painlessly in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep,</v>

599
00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:07.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's no suffering there.</v>

600
00:27:07.711 --> 00:27:12.711
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if anything you've just ended </v>

601
00:27:12.711 --> 00:27:12.711
<v Speaker 2>whatever suffering they were going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have in their future,</v>

602
00:27:12.711 --> 00:27:15.390
<v Speaker 2>why would that be a tragedy if it </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to all of us tonight?</v>

603
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.050
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

604
00:27:16.051 --> 00:27:16.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

605
00:27:16.411 --> 00:27:21.411
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some neurotoxin comes down from space </v>

606
00:27:21.411 --> 00:27:24.441
<v Speaker 2>and kills us all in our sleep and no </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering is associated with it.</v>

607
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:27.030
<v Speaker 2>The only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

608
00:27:27.031 --> 00:27:27.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethically speaking,</v>

609
00:27:27.991 --> 00:27:30.600
<v Speaker 2>the only problem there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a huge one,</v>

610
00:27:30.601 --> 00:27:35.601
<v Speaker 2>is that it forecloses all of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible happy future is most of us are,</v>

611
00:27:36.541 --> 00:27:39.080
<v Speaker 2>all of us are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least some of us we're going to have.</v>

612
00:27:39.081 --> 00:27:44.081
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the good things that we could </v>

613
00:27:44.081 --> 00:27:44.910
<v Speaker 2>have done over the next million years </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't going to get done.</v>

614
00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:46.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the beauty,</v>

615
00:27:46.591 --> 00:27:48.120
<v Speaker 2>all the creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the joy,</v>

616
00:27:48.121 --> 00:27:50.220
<v Speaker 2>all of that just gets canceled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

617
00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:53.260
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so leaving the,</v>

618
00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:56.300
<v Speaker 2>the painfulness of pain aside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

619
00:27:56.310 --> 00:28:01.310
<v Speaker 2>why is it wrong to deprive any given </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal of life?</v>

620
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:06.590
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in so far as that life has any </v>

621
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:08.991
<v Speaker 2>intrinsic value in so far as that in so </v>
<v Speaker 2>far as the being that animal is better </v>

622
00:28:09.541 --> 00:28:11.220
<v Speaker 2>than being nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

623
00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:13.980
<v Speaker 2>Then you're also just canceling all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that good stuff.</v>

624
00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:15.600
<v Speaker 2>And for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

625
00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:18.320
<v Speaker 2>for any good stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need a,</v>

626
00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.600
<v Speaker 2>a nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

627
00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:21.870
<v Speaker 2>If and for any pain you need to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nervous system.</v>

628
00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:24.310
<v Speaker 2>So far as we understand this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

629
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:26.520
<v Speaker 2>though there are people who say any good</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

630
00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:30.420
<v Speaker 2>what do you experience any original </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement though,</v>

631
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:35.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like being prejudice about the </v>

632
00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.600
<v Speaker 2>experiences that plants are having been </v>
<v Speaker 2>by being immobile,</v>

633
00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:41.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you ever thought ever paid </v>

634
00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:42.590
<v Speaker 2>attention to some of the more recent </v>
<v Speaker 2>research on plant intelligence and weird</v>

635
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.590
<v Speaker 2>stuff that's going on with them?</v>

636
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:48.590
<v Speaker 2>Calculations and they're exuding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm expressing some sense that causes a </v>

637
00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:53.130
<v Speaker 2>when they're being eaten,</v>
<v Speaker 2>causes other other plants.</v>

638
00:28:53.131 --> 00:28:56.550
<v Speaker 2>Downwind changed their flavor to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 2>predation.</v>

639
00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:59.540
<v Speaker 2>There was a New Yorker article on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget when this came out.</v>

640
00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:01.380
<v Speaker 2>We.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

641
00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:03.360
<v Speaker 2>There's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's weird stuff that plants do,</v>

642
00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:08.600
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I remember the details of that </v>

643
00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.631
<v Speaker 2>article aren't so clear to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember not knowing what to think </v>

644
00:29:11.631 --> 00:29:14.571
<v Speaker 2>about some of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some of it clearly can be explained </v>

645
00:29:14.571 --> 00:29:17.220
<v Speaker 2>in evolutionary terms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't imply any experience.</v>

646
00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:22.280
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could all be dark and it's all blind </v>

647
00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:22.280
<v Speaker 2>mechanism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so the,</v>

648
00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:26.160
<v Speaker 2>it still has consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The consciousness as we know it is.</v>

649
00:29:26.161 --> 00:29:28.110
<v Speaker 2>What's most valuable to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

650
00:29:28.111 --> 00:29:31.050
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the only thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>valuable to anything.</v>

651
00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.150
<v Speaker 2>It's like when you're going to talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about value,</v>

652
00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.420
<v Speaker 2>so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

653
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:38.910
<v Speaker 2>if this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this cup has no experience,</v>

654
00:29:38.911 --> 00:29:39.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

655
00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:44.120
<v Speaker 2>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if my trading places with it insofar as </v>

656
00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.501
<v Speaker 2>you can make sense of that concept is </v>
<v Speaker 2>synonymous with just canceling my </v>

657
00:29:46.811 --> 00:29:48.450
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then there's,</v>

658
00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:50.530
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this cup is unconscious.</v>

659
00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:52.240
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing that is like to be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cup.</v>

660
00:29:52.241 --> 00:29:56.110
<v Speaker 2>When I break it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't created a suffering.</v>

661
00:29:56.350 --> 00:30:00.190
<v Speaker 2>I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't done anything unethical to the</v>

662
00:30:00.191 --> 00:30:05.191
<v Speaker 2>cup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no ethical responsibilities </v>

663
00:30:05.191 --> 00:30:08.311
<v Speaker 2>toward the cup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the moment you give me something </v>

664
00:30:08.311 --> 00:30:10.381
<v Speaker 2>that can be made happy or be made </v>
<v Speaker 2>miserable depending on how I behave </v>

665
00:30:10.571 --> 00:30:12.970
<v Speaker 2>around it or toward it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then I'm,</v>

666
00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:15.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm ethically entangled with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it's.</v>

667
00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.170
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that begins to scale.</v>

668
00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:22.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in a fairly linear way with just</v>

669
00:30:22.571 --> 00:30:24.380
<v Speaker 2>how complex the thing is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

670
00:30:24.381 --> 00:30:27.330
<v Speaker 2>and this is maybe something we even </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about on a previous podcast.</v>

671
00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:28.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

672
00:30:28.451 --> 00:30:32.470
<v Speaker 2>if I'm driving home today and I know bug</v>
<v Speaker 2>hits my windshield,</v>

673
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.860
<v Speaker 2>you know that that has whatever ethical </v>
<v Speaker 2>implication it has,</v>

674
00:30:35.861 --> 00:30:40.861
<v Speaker 2>but it's given what I believe about bugs</v>
<v Speaker 2>and given how small they are and given </v>

675
00:30:40.861 --> 00:30:45.400
<v Speaker 2>how little they do and given how </v>
<v Speaker 2>primitive their nervous systems are,</v>

676
00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:47.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

677
00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:48.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to lose sleep over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

678
00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:49.990
<v Speaker 2>killing a bug.</v>

679
00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:53.680
<v Speaker 2>If I hit a squirrel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to feel worse.</v>

680
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:56.340
<v Speaker 2>If I had a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to feel worse than his son was</v>

681
00:30:56.341 --> 00:31:01.341
<v Speaker 2>a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously I may never get over it and </v>

682
00:31:01.341 --> 00:31:01.341
<v Speaker 2>even if I live to be a thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

683
00:31:01.341 --> 00:31:03.370
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the scaling and,</v>

684
00:31:03.371 --> 00:31:08.080
<v Speaker 2>and granted there are cultural </v>
<v Speaker 2>accretions there so you can.</v>

685
00:31:08.081 --> 00:31:11.590
<v Speaker 2>I justify that the way I feel about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dog as opposed to a deer,</v>

686
00:31:11.591 --> 00:31:12.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's a difference,</v>

687
00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:18.150
<v Speaker 2>but the difference is one of richness of</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience in so far as we understand </v>

688
00:31:20.711 --> 00:31:22.120
<v Speaker 2>what other species experience,</v>

689
00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:28.100
<v Speaker 1>you could make that argument to justify </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating animals as opposed to being </v>

690
00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:28.470
<v Speaker 1>accountable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

691
00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:29.220
<v Speaker 1>You could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

692
00:31:29.221 --> 00:31:32.520
<v Speaker 1>what kind of experiences a deer have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just running around the woods.</v>

693
00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:35.070
<v Speaker 1>Try not to get eaten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They eat grass they made.</v>

694
00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:40.100
<v Speaker 1>It's very simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very simple experience in </v>

695
00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.531
<v Speaker 1>comparison to your average person that </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives in Los Angeles that reads books,</v>

696
00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:49.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean someone who goes into a lot of </v>

697
00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:49.160
<v Speaker 1>trips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone has a lot of loved ones.</v>

698
00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:52.640
<v Speaker 1>Someone who has a great career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone who's deeply invested in their </v>

699
00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:52.640
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

700
00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Is much more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

701
00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:57.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's much more complexity and the </v>

702
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:59.781
<v Speaker 1>deer behave just as deer all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>place and it's a very primitive sort of </v>

703
00:31:59.781 --> 00:31:59.810
<v Speaker 1>a life form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

704
00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:01.840
<v Speaker 1>if you go further and further back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what did.</v>

705
00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:06.910
<v Speaker 1>It seems like you can keep going with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and one of the things that I that </v>

706
00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:11.540
<v Speaker 1>concerns me the most about plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not concerns me but puzzles me the most </v>

707
00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:13.500
<v Speaker 1>about plants is whether or not the way I</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at them,</v>

708
00:32:13.501 --> 00:32:15.540
<v Speaker 1>me personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my prejudices about them,</v>

709
00:32:15.541 --> 00:32:19.350
<v Speaker 1>I just not thinking at all of them as </v>
<v Speaker 1>being conscious.</v>

710
00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:25.070
<v Speaker 1>What if we think about things in terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the complexity of their experiences,</v>

711
00:32:25.111 --> 00:32:30.111
<v Speaker 1>just because we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're prejudiced about things that move </v>

712
00:32:30.111 --> 00:32:30.650
<v Speaker 1>made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's entirely possible that like,</v>

713
00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:33.930
<v Speaker 1>it's going to sound really stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've said a lot of stupid shit.</v>

714
00:32:33.931 --> 00:32:37.080
<v Speaker 1>I went into a grow room once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a pot grow room,</v>

715
00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:40.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy had his Mac daddy room and</v>

716
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.270
<v Speaker 3>I walked in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

717
00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:44.120
<v Speaker 3>this is like being in a room full of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

718
00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:46.850
<v Speaker 3>This feels weird as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It felt.</v>

719
00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:52.030
<v Speaker 3>It felt very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It felt like there was a tangible like </v>

720
00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:56.350
<v Speaker 3>vibe of life in there and there's no </v>
<v Speaker 3>other way to describe that without </v>

721
00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:57.740
<v Speaker 3>sounding like a complete moron,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

722
00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:00.170
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was my experience.</v>

723
00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:02.120
<v Speaker 3>I know what it's like to be that more </v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

724
00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.870
<v Speaker 3>but you know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take enough acid.</v>

725
00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:09.880
<v Speaker 3>You know what you're talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that we shouldn't eat </v>

726
00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:09.880
<v Speaker 3>plants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not done.</v>

727
00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:13.681
<v Speaker 3>I've seen people were ready up in arms </v>
<v Speaker 3>with their twitter fingers ready to get </v>

728
00:33:13.681 --> 00:33:17.201
<v Speaker 3>off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I am saying is it's entirely </v>

729
00:33:17.201 --> 00:33:19.841
<v Speaker 3>possible that all things that are alive </v>
<v Speaker 3>have some sort of a way of of being </v>

730
00:33:20.331 --> 00:33:22.820
<v Speaker 3>conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>May Not be mobile,</v>

731
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.000
<v Speaker 3>may not be as expressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there might be the stillness of you </v>

732
00:33:28.221 --> 00:33:31.760
<v Speaker 3>without language when you're in a place </v>
<v Speaker 3>of complete peace,</v>

733
00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:33.890
<v Speaker 3>when you're in a zen meditative state.</v>

734
00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:39.370
<v Speaker 3>What about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stillness is really truly associated </v>

735
00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:42.101
<v Speaker 3>with being a human are really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>truly associated with being an English </v>

736
00:33:42.101 --> 00:33:44.120
<v Speaker 3>speaking person in North America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost nothing.</v>

737
00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:45.740
<v Speaker 3>It's just an existence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

738
00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.190
<v Speaker 3>and then everything else sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>branches out from that and then humans,</v>

739
00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:54.370
<v Speaker 3>we all make the agreement that of course</v>
<v Speaker 3>it branches out far further and wider </v>

740
00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:57.581
<v Speaker 3>than any other animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how do we know that these plants </v>

741
00:33:57.581 --> 00:33:57.581
<v Speaker 3>aren't branching out like that too?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do we know that?</v>

742
00:33:57.581 --> 00:34:00.650
<v Speaker 3>Then if they're having some </v>
<v Speaker 3>communication with each other,</v>

743
00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:05.890
<v Speaker 3>if they're responding to probation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're literally changing their </v>

744
00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:07.430
<v Speaker 3>flavor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing all these calculations and</v>

745
00:34:07.431 --> 00:34:12.431
<v Speaker 3>all these strange things that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>finding out that plants are capable of </v>

746
00:34:12.431 --> 00:34:12.431
<v Speaker 3>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what?</v>

747
00:34:12.431 --> 00:34:14.930
<v Speaker 3>What is going on there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know necessarily.</v>

748
00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:21.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm agnostic on the question of how far </v>
<v Speaker 3>down consciousness goes and I agree that</v>

749
00:34:21.471 --> 00:34:26.471
<v Speaker 3>there's very likely a condition of </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like pure consciousness that </v>

750
00:34:26.471 --> 00:34:31.031
<v Speaker 3>really is separable from the details of </v>
<v Speaker 3>any given species.</v>

751
00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:34.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's something that I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced myself.</v>

752
00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:37.160
<v Speaker 3>It feels like you certainly have this </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>

753
00:34:37.161 --> 00:34:38.750
<v Speaker 3>what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what its implications are.</v>

754
00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:45.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can have the experience of just </v>

755
00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:48.431
<v Speaker 3>consciousness and it doesn't have any </v>
<v Speaker 3>personal or even human reference point,</v>

756
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:50.660
<v Speaker 3>so it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

757
00:34:50.661 --> 00:34:55.661
<v Speaker 3>You're not even.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't even have a reference point </v>

758
00:34:55.661 --> 00:34:57.230
<v Speaker 3>in one of the channel that the human </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense channels so you're not seeing.</v>

759
00:34:57.231 --> 00:35:02.231
<v Speaker 3>You're not hearing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not smelling and you're not </v>

760
00:35:02.231 --> 00:35:04.130
<v Speaker 3>thinking and you're yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are.</v>

761
00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:09.210
<v Speaker 3>So there is still just open conscious </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience and whether that is.</v>

762
00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:15.640
<v Speaker 3>That is what it's like to be a plant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know because I don't know what </v>

763
00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:19.721
<v Speaker 3>the relationship between consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 3>and information processing in the brain </v>

764
00:35:19.721 --> 00:35:21.770
<v Speaker 3>actually is though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

765
00:35:21.771 --> 00:35:22.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

766
00:35:22.311 --> 00:35:24.110
<v Speaker 3>it's totally plausible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

767
00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:27.230
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's probably the most plausible</v>

768
00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:32.260
<v Speaker 3>thesis that there is some direct </v>
<v Speaker 3>connection between information </v>

769
00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:35.870
<v Speaker 3>processing and integrated information </v>
<v Speaker 3>processing and consciousness and that </v>

770
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:38.130
<v Speaker 3>and that there is nothing that's like to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be this</v>

771
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:39.390
<v Speaker 2>cup and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

772
00:35:39.391 --> 00:35:41.810
<v Speaker 2>the atoms are not conscious and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

773
00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:42.450
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet,</v>

774
00:35:42.451 --> 00:35:46.170
<v Speaker 2>but that the thesis that every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that consciousness goes all the way down</v>

775
00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:49.530
<v Speaker 2>into the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most basic constituents of matter,</v>

776
00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:51.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

777
00:35:51.171 --> 00:35:55.270
<v Speaker 2>that thesis is called Panpsychism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy and that's pan everywhere.</v>

778
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:58.020
<v Speaker 2>A psych is a mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

779
00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:01.020
<v Speaker 2>so that the mind is sometimes everywhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>in nature.</v>

780
00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:03.990
<v Speaker 2>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't rule that out.</v>

781
00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:09.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing we know about the world </v>

782
00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:09.510
<v Speaker 2>to rule that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I think you can rule out is,</v>

783
00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:12.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

784
00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:18.010
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the richness of the content of </v>

785
00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:18.270
<v Speaker 2>consciousness in these species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

786
00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:21.660
<v Speaker 2>so plants are not having conversations </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this,</v>

787
00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:26.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So plants don't understand what we're </v>

788
00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:26.690
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way they would.</v>

789
00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:26.690
<v Speaker 2>There's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

790
00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:28.310
<v Speaker 2>they don't have nervous systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not there,</v>

791
00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:33.320
<v Speaker 2>they can't be processing information in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a way that would give them what we know </v>

792
00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:33.990
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a rich experience.</v>

793
00:36:33.991 --> 00:36:37.620
<v Speaker 2>But your point about the timescale and </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement is,</v>

794
00:36:37.621 --> 00:36:39.070
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is totally valid if,</v>

795
00:36:39.071 --> 00:36:44.071
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if every time you walked into a room </v>

796
00:36:44.071 --> 00:36:44.250
<v Speaker 2>you're affirmed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just turned and looked at you,</v>

797
00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:48.550
<v Speaker 2>just oriented towards you and followed </v>
<v Speaker 2>you around the room with its,</v>

798
00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:53.340
<v Speaker 2>with its leading branch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would feel very different about,</v>

799
00:36:53.341 --> 00:36:55.410
<v Speaker 2>it's the possibility that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious,</v>

800
00:36:55.411 --> 00:36:55.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

801
00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:58.070
<v Speaker 3>You'd be a good person to ask this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but is that a,</v>

802
00:36:58.071 --> 00:37:00.240
<v Speaker 3>an urban myth that if you sing to your </v>
<v Speaker 3>plants,</v>

803
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:01.440
<v Speaker 3>your plants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>music,</v>

804
00:37:01.441 --> 00:37:02.220
<v Speaker 3>that they grow better?</v>

805
00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:05.180
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't looked into it.</v>

806
00:37:05.181 --> 00:37:05.500
<v Speaker 2>I would have.</v>

807
00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:07.640
<v Speaker 3>When you define,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would bet that it is.</v>

808
00:37:07.641 --> 00:37:12.641
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like one of those things will </v>

809
00:37:12.641 --> 00:37:12.641
<v Speaker 3>chicks who like crystals tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

810
00:37:12.641 --> 00:37:12.641
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

811
00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:14.060
<v Speaker 3>I would bet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would bet that it is.</v>

812
00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:16.970
<v Speaker 3>I sing to my flowers and they grow so </v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful.</v>

813
00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:22.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like one of those things that </v>

814
00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:23.771
<v Speaker 3>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm definitely not insinuating that </v>

815
00:37:23.771 --> 00:37:23.771
<v Speaker 3>plants would have as rich and experience</v>
<v Speaker 3>as human beings,</v>

816
00:37:23.771 --> 00:37:25.630
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think a deer has as rich an </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

817
00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:25.950
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

818
00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.100
<v Speaker 3>As a human being either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's just to me,</v>

819
00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:28.890
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

820
00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:33.970
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my curiosity lies in the future of </v>

821
00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:39.130
<v Speaker 3>understanding plant intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like wouldn't it be fascinating if we </v>

822
00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:39.130
<v Speaker 3>found out that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

823
00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:43.570
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons why psychedelic drugs</v>
<v Speaker 3>puzzled me so much is that they exist </v>

824
00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:47.930
<v Speaker 3>and there's a lot of plants you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>just eat them and you have your brain </v>

825
00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:47.990
<v Speaker 3>already has this place.</v>

826
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:49.880
<v Speaker 3>It'll go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you eat these plants,</v>

827
00:37:49.881 --> 00:37:51.590
<v Speaker 3>like if you eat pod,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

828
00:37:51.591 --> 00:37:55.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you try the San Pedro cactus out this</v>

829
00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:56.160
<v Speaker 3>spring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

830
00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:57.410
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

831
00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:02.560
<v Speaker 3>you can have these really powerful </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic experiences just from a </v>

832
00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:06.251
<v Speaker 3>plant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why does the human mind interact </v>

833
00:38:06.251 --> 00:38:06.530
<v Speaker 3>with these plants like that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like especially fungus,</v>

834
00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.410
<v Speaker 3>like when you have like major league </v>
<v Speaker 3>mushroom trips,</v>

835
00:38:09.411 --> 00:38:14.411
<v Speaker 3>it's very strange sort of feeling like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in communication with another </v>

836
00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:21.730
<v Speaker 3>Mckenna described it best in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That there's someone there that it's not</v>

837
00:38:22.701 --> 00:38:27.701
<v Speaker 3>just you and hallucinations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has this distinct feeling that </v>

838
00:38:27.701 --> 00:38:32.010
<v Speaker 3>there's someone there and that someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>according to the.</v>

839
00:38:32.011 --> 00:38:35.360
<v Speaker 3>The hippiest of hippies is plan </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence.</v>

840
00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:37.450
<v Speaker 3>It's my mother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gaia.</v>

841
00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:39.460
<v Speaker 3>It's the earth itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all life.</v>

842
00:38:39.461 --> 00:38:40.690
<v Speaker 3>It's love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's God.</v>

843
00:38:40.691 --> 00:38:45.691
<v Speaker 3>It's all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It all exists inside the intelligence </v>

844
00:38:45.691 --> 00:38:48.901
<v Speaker 3>that's intertwined in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the most things that one of </v>

845
00:38:48.901 --> 00:38:51.070
<v Speaker 3>the things that's most puzzling about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the most potent of all psychedelics,</v>

846
00:38:51.071 --> 00:38:56.071
<v Speaker 3>which is dimethyltryptamine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's in so many different plants </v>

847
00:38:56.071 --> 00:38:59.670
<v Speaker 3>like to make dimethyltryptamine </v>
<v Speaker 3>containing plants illegal would be </v>

848
00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:03.811
<v Speaker 3>hilarious because there'd be like </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds and hundreds of plants they'd </v>

849
00:39:03.811 --> 00:39:05.800
<v Speaker 3>have to make illegal like including like</v>
<v Speaker 3>full Eris grass.</v>

850
00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:09.310
<v Speaker 3>It's just really rich and five methoxy </v>
<v Speaker 3>dimethyltryptamine,</v>

851
00:39:09.311 --> 00:39:11.440
<v Speaker 3>which is the most potent potent form of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

852
00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:15.150
<v Speaker 3>Also our own brains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so every,</v>

853
00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:20.490
<v Speaker 3>every brick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every brain makes it a little weird </v>

854
00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:23.260
<v Speaker 3>little lizards that have retinas and </v>
<v Speaker 3>lenses where their pineal gland is.</v>

855
00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.900
<v Speaker 3>They're making it in their little screwy</v>
<v Speaker 3>little lizard brains.</v>

856
00:39:25.901 --> 00:39:28.220
<v Speaker 3>We don't even know what the hell is for </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the the,</v>

857
00:39:28.221 --> 00:39:33.221
<v Speaker 3>the questions about are just so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many more questions than </v>

858
00:39:33.221 --> 00:39:33.550
<v Speaker 3>there are answers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>

859
00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:35.380
<v Speaker 3>you've paid attention to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

860
00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:37.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rick strassman stuff,</v>

861
00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:39.100
<v Speaker 3>the general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that book did you know,</v>

862
00:39:39.101 --> 00:39:44.101
<v Speaker 3>that the cottonwood research foundation </v>
<v Speaker 3>and actually found mice brains producing</v>

863
00:39:44.801 --> 00:39:49.801
<v Speaker 3>dimethyltryptamine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's been proven that it's actually </v>

864
00:39:49.801 --> 00:39:51.440
<v Speaker 3>been growing in the pineal gland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gland that they had always.</v>

865
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:52.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

866
00:39:52.391 --> 00:39:52.920
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

867
00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:56.810
<v Speaker 2>I had assumed that if I got that from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the book or not,</v>

868
00:39:56.811 --> 00:39:57.710
<v Speaker 2>but that's crazy</v>

869
00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:04.300
<v Speaker 3>as a neuroscientist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like doesn't that kind of freak you out </v>

870
00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:07.451
<v Speaker 3>that those Egyptians had those third </v>
<v Speaker 3>eyes and like all the eastern mysticism </v>

871
00:40:07.451 --> 00:40:11.321
<v Speaker 3>had that pineal gland highlighted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like the on the end of shafts are</v>

872
00:40:11.691 --> 00:40:13.730
<v Speaker 3>staff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would put those pine cones like how</v>

873
00:40:13.731 --> 00:40:14.840
<v Speaker 3>the hell they know all that.</v>

874
00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:16.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a,</v>

875
00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:21.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean the third eye metaphor or I mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not as more than a metaphor,</v>

876
00:40:22.321 --> 00:40:23.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anatomically,</v>

877
00:40:23.911 --> 00:40:24.960
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

878
00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:26.940
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

879
00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:32.570
<v Speaker 2>it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it correlates with the kind of </v>

880
00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:34.011
<v Speaker 2>experience you can have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't actually know if the experience </v>

881
00:40:34.011 --> 00:40:37.311
<v Speaker 2>people have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the shocker of you need to talk </v>

882
00:40:37.311 --> 00:40:38.850
<v Speaker 2>in yoga terms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

883
00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:42.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that has anything to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the pineal gland,</v>

884
00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:44.850
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it may be because I don't know,</v>

885
00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:48.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anyone's done this </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroimaging experiment where he can get</v>

886
00:40:48.451 --> 00:40:53.451
<v Speaker 2>people who can reliably produce a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a third eye opening sort of experience </v>

887
00:40:53.451 --> 00:40:55.050
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and scan their brains while they do it.</v>

888
00:40:55.860 --> 00:41:00.860
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm almost positive that hasn't been </v>

889
00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:00.860
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

890
00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:04.731
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a phenomenology here of people </v>

891
00:41:04.731 --> 00:41:07.911
<v Speaker 2>having a kind of inner opening of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost certainly largely a matter </v>

892
00:41:09.051 --> 00:41:11.580
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of visual cortex getting stimulated,</v>

893
00:41:11.581 --> 00:41:16.581
<v Speaker 2>but you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can meditate in such a way as to </v>

894
00:41:16.581 --> 00:41:16.581
<v Speaker 2>produce this experience.</v>

895
00:41:16.581 --> 00:41:17.030
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

896
00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:20.790
<v Speaker 2>it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an experience that you have more or</v>

897
00:41:20.791 --> 00:41:23.220
<v Speaker 2>less on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on different psychedelics.</v>

898
00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:28.760
<v Speaker 2>Psychedelics are much more visual than </v>
<v Speaker 2>others and certain doses in particular </v>

899
00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:31.080
<v Speaker 2>like mushrooms and DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I've never taken,</v>

900
00:41:31.081 --> 00:41:31.740
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

901
00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can say better than I,</v>

902
00:41:34.101 --> 00:41:39.101
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's reported to be quite visual and </v>

903
00:41:39.101 --> 00:41:39.101
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

904
00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:40.970
<v Speaker 2>the experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

905
00:41:40.971 --> 00:41:42.950
<v Speaker 2>so in most people when they close their </v>
<v Speaker 2>eyes,</v>

906
00:41:42.951 --> 00:41:47.951
<v Speaker 2>unless they have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having hypnogogic imagery is before </v>

907
00:41:47.951 --> 00:41:47.951
<v Speaker 2>sleep or they just have to happen to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

908
00:41:47.951 --> 00:41:50.720
<v Speaker 2>super good visualizers of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of imagery.</v>

909
00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:56.140
<v Speaker 2>You close your eyes and you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically have darkness there right now </v>

910
00:41:56.140 --> 00:42:00.581
<v Speaker 2>that now if you close your eyes and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're listening to this and you close </v>

911
00:42:00.581 --> 00:42:01.130
<v Speaker 2>your eyes and you look into the darkness</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your closed eyes,</v>

912
00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:03.710
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that actually is,</v>

913
00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:04.860
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

914
00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:09.080
<v Speaker 2>that is as much your visual field as it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is when your eyes are open,</v>

915
00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:09.470
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

916
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:14.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like your visual field hasn't </v>

917
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:14.470
<v Speaker 2>gone away when you close your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

918
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:18.790
<v Speaker 2>it's now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not much detail for you to </v>

919
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:20.360
<v Speaker 2>notice again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you are in some unusual state,</v>

920
00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.160
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

921
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:25.370
<v Speaker 2>based on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on different techniques of meditation.</v>

922
00:42:25.371 --> 00:42:28.370
<v Speaker 2>And this happened spontaneously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

923
00:42:28.371 --> 00:42:30.980
<v Speaker 2>with hypnogogic images or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or with psychedelics,</v>

924
00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:36.700
<v Speaker 2>that space can open up in to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a massive world of visual display,</v>

925
00:42:37.731 --> 00:42:39.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can just see a full blown,</v>

926
00:42:39.741 --> 00:42:41.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three d movie in there,</v>

927
00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:44.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a,</v>

928
00:42:44.901 --> 00:42:46.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

929
00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:49.220
<v Speaker 2>but most of us just take it for granted </v>
<v Speaker 2>that when you close your eyes,</v>

930
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:50.510
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're functionally blind,</v>

931
00:42:50.511 --> 00:42:55.511
<v Speaker 2>you can't see anything and you were not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were not interested in that space,</v>

932
00:42:55.671 --> 00:42:59.960
<v Speaker 2>but you can actually train yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 2>look deeply into that space as a,</v>

933
00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:01.430
<v Speaker 2>as a technique of meditation.</v>

934
00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:06.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to interrupt you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but does that have implications in </v>

935
00:43:06.490 --> 00:43:08.621
<v Speaker 3>people having eye witness testimony and </v>
<v Speaker 3>eye witness experiences that turned out </v>

936
00:43:09.021 --> 00:43:12.020
<v Speaker 3>to not be true at all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you think about the,</v>

937
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:12.670
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

938
00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:17.680
<v Speaker 3>the human mind and the imagination be </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to being able to create imagery </v>

939
00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:22.030
<v Speaker 3>once the eyes are closed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you can in sensory deprivation </v>

940
00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:24.941
<v Speaker 3>tanks like 10 sensory deprivation tanks </v>
<v Speaker 3>are that a lot of people's experiences </v>

941
00:43:24.941 --> 00:43:26.660
<v Speaker 3>are very visual even though it's in </v>
<v Speaker 3>complete darkness.</v>

942
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:29.900
<v Speaker 3>Now you know how people see things and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they thought they saw something.</v>

943
00:43:29.901 --> 00:43:34.901
<v Speaker 3>And it turns out to not be true at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's big foot or whether it's a </v>

944
00:43:34.901 --> 00:43:38.351
<v Speaker 3>robbery or a suspect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they get the details completely </v>

945
00:43:38.351 --> 00:43:41.740
<v Speaker 3>outright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but isn't it possible that under fear </v>

946
00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:45.340
<v Speaker 3>and when your your pulse is jacked up </v>
<v Speaker 3>and your adrenaline's running and you're</v>

947
00:43:46.041 --> 00:43:51.041
<v Speaker 3>worried about all these possibilities in</v>
<v Speaker 3>your imagination starts formulating </v>

948
00:43:51.041 --> 00:43:55.720
<v Speaker 3>predetermined possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should be looking out for like what </v>

949
00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:56.090
<v Speaker 3>if it's big foot?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if it's a Robert Wood?</v>

950
00:43:56.091 --> 00:44:01.091
<v Speaker 3>If it's an alien,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if it's at this and then these </v>

951
00:44:01.091 --> 00:44:03.100
<v Speaker 3>people that swear they saw these things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that everybody knows they didn't like.</v>

952
00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:05.150
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there was video footage or for </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it was.</v>

953
00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:08.420
<v Speaker 3>Is it possible that your brain can do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

954
00:44:08.421 --> 00:44:13.421
<v Speaker 3>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>U and t can literally show you things </v>

955
00:44:13.421 --> 00:44:13.421
<v Speaker 3>that aren't real?</v>

956
00:44:13.421 --> 00:44:14.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can do that.</v>

957
00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:19.550
<v Speaker 2>Although I think the unreliability of of</v>
<v Speaker 2>witness testimony and it's shockingly </v>

958
00:44:20.311 --> 00:44:25.311
<v Speaker 2>unreliable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is more a matter of memory that the </v>

959
00:44:25.311 --> 00:44:29.070
<v Speaker 2>corruption of memory and the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>memories are recall are there especially</v>

960
00:44:29.071 --> 00:44:34.071
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable when you're recalling them </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be revised when you were in the act </v>

961
00:44:34.831 --> 00:44:39.831
<v Speaker 2>of recall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's very easy to tamper with </v>

962
00:44:39.831 --> 00:44:39.831
<v Speaker 2>people's memory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

963
00:44:39.831 --> 00:44:42.450
<v Speaker 2>albeit inadvertently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can do this on purpose too,</v>

964
00:44:42.451 --> 00:44:47.451
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people just do it with bad </v>

965
00:44:47.451 --> 00:44:47.451
<v Speaker 2>interrogation techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

966
00:44:47.451 --> 00:44:47.451
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

967
00:44:47.451 --> 00:44:48.590
<v Speaker 2>the cop will ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

968
00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:50.400
<v Speaker 2>so when did you see the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

969
00:44:50.401 --> 00:44:55.401
<v Speaker 2>the woman at the crosswalk and he's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>put a woman at the crosswalk into your </v>

970
00:44:55.401 --> 00:44:55.860
<v Speaker 2>memory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

971
00:44:55.861 --> 00:45:00.861
<v Speaker 2>So because you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't help it visualize a woman at </v>

972
00:45:00.861 --> 00:45:02.640
<v Speaker 2>the crosswalk and his memory is very </v>
<v Speaker 2>fragile.</v>

973
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:07.700
<v Speaker 2>And so when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever you're giving an account of an </v>

974
00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:09.990
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it's an experience that happened</v>

975
00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:14.040
<v Speaker 2>half a second ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now we're in the domain of memory.</v>

976
00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:15.720
<v Speaker 2>Now we're in the domain of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

977
00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:20.820
<v Speaker 2>of just what you can report a we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a matter of what you're </v>

978
00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:22.410
<v Speaker 2>consciously experiencing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

979
00:45:22.411 --> 00:45:27.411
<v Speaker 2>I know there was a case in India where I</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe it was a woman was convicted of </v>

980
00:45:27.751 --> 00:45:32.751
<v Speaker 2>murder through the use of an Fmr rye or </v>
<v Speaker 2>a functioning magnetic resonance imagery</v>

981
00:45:34.021 --> 00:45:37.410
<v Speaker 2>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And through this Fmr I,</v>

982
00:45:37.411 --> 00:45:42.411
<v Speaker 2>they determined in some strange way that</v>
<v Speaker 2>she had functional knowledge of the </v>

983
00:45:43.831 --> 00:45:46.350
<v Speaker 2>crime scene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the argument against that,</v>

984
00:45:46.351 --> 00:45:51.351
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that she could have developed </v>

985
00:45:51.351 --> 00:45:54.960
<v Speaker 2>functional memory of the crime scene by </v>
<v Speaker 2>being told you're being prosecuted for a</v>

986
00:45:54.961 --> 00:45:56.640
<v Speaker 2>crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might go to jail for murder.</v>

987
00:45:56.850 --> 00:46:01.850
<v Speaker 2>Here's the crime scene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's or just being unlucky enough </v>

988
00:46:02.401 --> 00:46:05.700
<v Speaker 2>to be familiar as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

989
00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:09.750
<v Speaker 2>normally when this gets done and there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are people who do it in the states,</v>

990
00:46:09.751 --> 00:46:12.180
<v Speaker 2>but they don't use Fmri as their </v>
<v Speaker 2>modality,</v>

991
00:46:12.181 --> 00:46:13.080
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do,</v>

992
00:46:13.081 --> 00:46:18.081
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do sort of interrogate people's </v>

993
00:46:18.081 --> 00:46:18.081
<v Speaker 2>familiarity.</v>

994
00:46:18.081 --> 00:46:18.081
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>

995
00:46:18.081 --> 00:46:18.810
<v Speaker 2>they use eeg as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>

996
00:46:18.850 --> 00:46:22.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a way of monitoring.</v>

997
00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:23.300
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

998
00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:26.130
<v Speaker 2>their familiarity with those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Show them,</v>

999
00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:31.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are shown evidence from the crime</v>

1000
00:46:31.531 --> 00:46:34.440
<v Speaker 2>scene that only the perpetrator could </v>
<v Speaker 2>have seen,</v>

1001
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:39.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully it's really something that </v>

1002
00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:39.470
<v Speaker 2>only the perpetrator could have seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if,</v>

1003
00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:43.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they show you the picture and you </v>

1004
00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:43.940
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see the,</v>

1005
00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:43.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1006
00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:46.880
<v Speaker 2>I have that Ikea End table and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have that dress from banana republic </v>

1007
00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:47.070
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1008
00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:52.970
<v Speaker 2>that just by dint of bad luck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're familiar with something that </v>

1009
00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:54.120
<v Speaker 2>you're being shown from the crime scene </v>
<v Speaker 2>and especially if it's a murder,</v>

1010
00:46:54.121 --> 00:46:57.090
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about someone who's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was probably intimate with.</v>

1011
00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:00.240
<v Speaker 2>She probably knew them at least.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she's probably been good house.</v>

1012
00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:05.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that would be obviously a case </v>

1013
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.270
<v Speaker 2>where you really couldn't do it at all.</v>

1014
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:08.760
<v Speaker 2>How does it work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't I know no one in the states as</v>

1015
00:47:08.761 --> 00:47:12.240
<v Speaker 2>far as I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless this has changed in the last year</v>

1016
00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:14.550
<v Speaker 2>or so since I've paid attention to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

1017
00:47:14.551 --> 00:47:17.310
<v Speaker 2>this none.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of this is admissible in court were</v>

1018
00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:22.520
<v Speaker 2>only on India and it's only the one case</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I ever heard of crazy premature use</v>

1019
00:47:22.831 --> 00:47:25.020
<v Speaker 2>of the technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how does the technology work?</v>

1020
00:47:25.021 --> 00:47:30.021
<v Speaker 2>Like what does it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does it actually seeing where you </v>

1021
00:47:30.021 --> 00:47:30.021
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1022
00:47:30.021 --> 00:47:32.320
<v Speaker 2>with Eeg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this has worked out more.</v>

1023
00:47:32.321 --> 00:47:33.830
<v Speaker 2>You can have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1024
00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:38.930
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kind of a canonical familiarity </v>

1025
00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:40.360
<v Speaker 2>response to a stimuli.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've seen something,</v>

1026
00:47:40.361 --> 00:47:45.361
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you've seen seen something for the </v>

1027
00:47:45.361 --> 00:47:45.361
<v Speaker 2>first time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1028
00:47:45.361 --> 00:47:47.140
<v Speaker 2>is it would be a novelty response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seeing something for the third,</v>

1029
00:47:47.141 --> 00:47:49.960
<v Speaker 2>fourth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fifth time would be a different response</v>

1030
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:51.730
<v Speaker 2>and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1031
00:47:51.731 --> 00:47:52.750
<v Speaker 2>this has been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1032
00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:54.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1033
00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:59.050
<v Speaker 2>it's been a long time since I've looked </v>
<v Speaker 2>at this particular research and I don't </v>

1034
00:47:59.050 --> 00:47:59.050
<v Speaker 2>know how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1035
00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:00.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what they're calling these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these wave forms now.</v>

1036
00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:05.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was a p 300 wave form at </v>
<v Speaker 2>one point and they're there way forms </v>

1037
00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:08.940
<v Speaker 2>that come from certain areas of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain at certain timing intervals based </v>

1038
00:48:09.881 --> 00:48:10.480
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1039
00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:14.620
<v Speaker 2>from the moment of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of receiving a stimulus,</v>

1040
00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:16.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say a photograph.</v>

1041
00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:21.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they are the hallmark of either </v>

1042
00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:25.900
<v Speaker 2>being familiar or not with this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1043
00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:28.810
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I mean it's not,</v>

1044
00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:34.750
<v Speaker 2>there's no question that at a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>point we will have reliable mind reading</v>

1045
00:48:34.751 --> 00:48:36.010
<v Speaker 2>machines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm not.</v>

1046
00:48:36.110 --> 00:48:37.990
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really just a matter of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1047
00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:41.320
<v Speaker 2>I think there's also no question that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have them now,</v>

1048
00:48:41.590 --> 00:48:44.290
<v Speaker 2>at least not in a way that we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can send some,</v>

1049
00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:47.950
<v Speaker 2>send someone to prison on the basis of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what their brain did an experiment.</v>

1050
00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:50.440
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1051
00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:54.310
<v Speaker 2>just as you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean anything but a lot,</v>

1052
00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:59.330
<v Speaker 2>a lot of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most interesting stuff is </v>

1053
00:48:59.330 --> 00:48:59.830
<v Speaker 2>unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anything you're consciously aware of</v>

1054
00:48:59.831 --> 00:49:01.690
<v Speaker 2>having seen before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1055
00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:04.600
<v Speaker 2>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were to show me this Cup,</v>

1056
00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:05.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1057
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:08.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five seconds later say,</v>

1058
00:49:08.441 --> 00:49:10.430
<v Speaker 2>is this the cup I showed you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1059
00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:14.430
<v Speaker 2>I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very clear sense of.</v>

1060
00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:15.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the cup,</v>

1061
00:49:15.311 --> 00:49:15.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1062
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:17.950
<v Speaker 2>and if you show me a completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>different cup,</v>

1063
00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:19.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have a very clear internal </v>
<v Speaker 2>sentiment.</v>

1064
00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:20.300
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

1065
00:49:20.310 --> 00:49:23.470
<v Speaker 2>And that's not the cup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're having that experience,</v>

1066
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:28.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that is absolutely something about </v>

1067
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:33.631
<v Speaker 2>the state of your brain that can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>discriminated by a person outside your </v>

1068
00:49:35.471 --> 00:49:40.471
<v Speaker 2>brain running the appropriate experiment</v>
<v Speaker 2>is just our tools are still sufficiently</v>

1069
00:49:41.171 --> 00:49:43.110
<v Speaker 2>course that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1070
00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:44.480
<v Speaker 2>it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1071
00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:46.690
<v Speaker 2>sequencing your dna where we can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1072
00:49:46.691 --> 00:49:47.640
<v Speaker 2>that was you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's your,</v>

1073
00:49:47.641 --> 00:49:49.000
<v Speaker 2>your uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blood at the crime scene.</v>

1074
00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:50.240
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1075
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:55.040
<v Speaker 2>eventually it will be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will be just,</v>

1076
00:49:55.750 --> 00:50:00.750
<v Speaker 2>there'll be no basis to doubt it because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be able to put you through a </v>

1077
00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:05.131
<v Speaker 2>paradigm where it'll just be clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know your thoughts,</v>

1078
00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:06.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1079
00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:09.850
<v Speaker 2>So to think of how much faith you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have in this technology,</v>

1080
00:50:09.851 --> 00:50:14.851
<v Speaker 2>if you could open your computer and read</v>
<v Speaker 2>any file a file of your choosing that I </v>

1081
00:50:16.901 --> 00:50:17.860
<v Speaker 2>have never seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1082
00:50:17.861 --> 00:50:21.530
<v Speaker 2>So the contents of which are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are completely blind,</v>

1083
00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:26.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm completely blind to and I'm scanning</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain while you're reading this </v>

1084
00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 2>journal entry or a newspaper or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1085
00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:31.040
<v Speaker 2>And at the end of that I can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1086
00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:33.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on this report,</v>

1087
00:50:33.621 --> 00:50:38.621
<v Speaker 2>you clearly read a story about Donald </v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump and you,</v>

1088
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:43.460
<v Speaker 2>you actually don't like Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I could tell you in detail about,</v>

1089
00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:48.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you were consciously thinking </v>

1090
00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:48.520
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1091
00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:48.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you did that,</v>

1092
00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:51.710
<v Speaker 2>if you could do that 100 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

1093
00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:53.330
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>At a certain point,</v>

1094
00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:57.350
<v Speaker 2>the basis to doubt the validity of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind reading machine would just go away.</v>

1095
00:50:57.351 --> 00:50:58.350
<v Speaker 2>You would just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be like,</v>

1096
00:50:58.900 --> 00:50:59.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1097
00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:01.100
<v Speaker 2>are you here really hearing my voice </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now?</v>

1098
00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:02.690
<v Speaker 2>You certainly seem to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1099
00:51:02.691 --> 00:51:03.560
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

1100
00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:05.510
<v Speaker 2>it would become a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a,</v>

1101
00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:10.850
<v Speaker 2>a background assumption that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology works at a certain point just</v>

1102
00:51:10.851 --> 00:51:13.400
<v Speaker 2>as though the meat is scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fake meat.</v>

1103
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:16.630
<v Speaker 2>That idea is terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea of losing the,</v>

1104
00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:20.070
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>losing your thoughts.</v>

1105
00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:21.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ownership.</v>

1106
00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:24.410
<v Speaker 2>Like losing a thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>becoming non autonomous,</v>

1107
00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:27.650
<v Speaker 2>like the idea of everybody sharing </v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts,</v>

1108
00:51:27.830 --> 00:51:29.690
<v Speaker 2>it seems almost inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1109
00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:30.300
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1110
00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:32.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that we would decide to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1111
00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:36.560
<v Speaker 2>Certainly I don't think we would do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would do this all the time,</v>

1112
00:51:36.561 --> 00:51:41.561
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it might be Sunday doing </v>

1113
00:51:41.561 --> 00:51:41.561
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no option.</v>

1114
00:51:41.561 --> 00:51:41.561
<v Speaker 2>We might be compelled to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1115
00:51:41.561 --> 00:51:42.890
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're at a murder trial,</v>

1116
00:51:42.891 --> 00:51:43.390
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

1117
00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:45.760
<v Speaker 2>someone who may have killed somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1118
00:51:45.830 --> 00:51:47.120
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1119
00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:52.140
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fifth amendment becomes interesting </v>

1120
00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:52.140
<v Speaker 2>in that case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1121
00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:52.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1122
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:54.020
<v Speaker 2>we have worked that out for DNA </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence,</v>

1123
00:51:54.021 --> 00:51:54.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1124
00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:56.210
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a right to take the fifth,</v>

1125
00:51:56.211 --> 00:51:59.360
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have a right to withhold </v>
<v Speaker 2>your blood from the proceeding.</v>

1126
00:51:59.390 --> 00:52:00.230
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I get,</v>

1127
00:52:00.231 --> 00:52:03.200
<v Speaker 2>I get to look at your blood or your </v>
<v Speaker 2>saliva so you don't have to talk,</v>

1128
00:52:03.201 --> 00:52:04.190
<v Speaker 2>but I can read your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1129
00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:05.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

1130
00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:07.130
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1131
00:52:07.131 --> 00:52:09.320
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like the iphone case,</v>

1132
00:52:09.321 --> 00:52:14.321
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like I thus far decided that we </v>

1133
00:52:14.321 --> 00:52:18.260
<v Speaker 2>can't compel apple to unlock an iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1134
00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:21.630
<v Speaker 2>this is just the ultimate case of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

1135
00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:26.980
<v Speaker 2>the argument in favor of apple is this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is far too intimate and far too </v>

1136
00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:29.330
<v Speaker 2>comprehensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at a person's mind.</v>

1137
00:52:29.850 --> 00:52:30.340
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1138
00:52:30.350 --> 00:52:32.140
<v Speaker 2>once you have cracked their iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1139
00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:35.480
<v Speaker 2>you're basically walking around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>corridors of their brain,</v>

1140
00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:37.720
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1141
00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:40.100
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a slippery slope.</v>

1142
00:52:40.101 --> 00:52:45.101
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to go down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately we will be able to do it </v>

1143
00:52:45.101 --> 00:52:45.101
<v Speaker 2>with brains.</v>

1144
00:52:45.101 --> 00:52:50.020
<v Speaker 2>And I think it obviously you're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna want all of the safeguards that </v>

1145
00:52:54.261 --> 00:52:59.090
<v Speaker 2>you can easily imagine and probably some</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have yet to imagine on this process,</v>

1146
00:52:59.091 --> 00:53:04.091
<v Speaker 2>but safeguards in place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this would be the best thing </v>

1147
00:53:04.091 --> 00:53:05.060
<v Speaker 2>that could ever happen to us in terms </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1148
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:05.810
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1149
00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:10.960
<v Speaker 2>when you look at a criminal justice </v>
<v Speaker 2>system and that when you look at the </v>

1150
00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:13.361
<v Speaker 2>price we pay for not being able to tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether someone is innocent or guilty or</v>

1151
00:53:13.911 --> 00:53:15.350
<v Speaker 2>whether they're lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is just,</v>

1152
00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:20.510
<v Speaker 2>it is the most intolerable price that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>see in society.</v>

1153
00:53:20.511 --> 00:53:25.511
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just the amount of human misery </v>

1154
00:53:25.511 --> 00:53:29.520
<v Speaker 2>born of not being able to demonstrate </v>
<v Speaker 2>that someone is lying reliably.</v>

1155
00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:31.830
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's off.</v>

1156
00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:34.470
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the biggest lever that would,</v>

1157
00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:39.480
<v Speaker 2>I think we could pull certainly when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have prisons that are filled with a lot </v>

1158
00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:39.480
<v Speaker 2>of people that are probably innocent.</v>

1159
00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:39.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1160
00:53:40.090 --> 00:53:43.200
<v Speaker 2>People who have gone to to the gallows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no doubt.</v>

1161
00:53:43.210 --> 00:53:46.800
<v Speaker 2>And we know innocent people who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been killed.</v>

1162
00:53:46.801 --> 00:53:50.580
<v Speaker 2>And so one way to deal with as you be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be against the death penalty.</v>

1163
00:53:50.581 --> 00:53:52.440
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's always a chance to find their</v>

1164
00:53:52.441 --> 00:53:55.170
<v Speaker 2>innocence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But imagine being in prison on death row</v>

1165
00:53:55.171 --> 00:53:58.020
<v Speaker 2>for 30 years and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for rape or rape,</v>

1166
00:53:58.021 --> 00:53:59.100
<v Speaker 2>you didn't commit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1167
00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:01.380
<v Speaker 2>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so horrible.</v>

1168
00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:02.790
<v Speaker 2>Terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1169
00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:06.540
<v Speaker 2>that would be the major argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be such a simple solution.</v>

1170
00:54:06.541 --> 00:54:10.050
<v Speaker 2>Really A,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now there are corner cases that wouldn't</v>

1171
00:54:10.051 --> 00:54:15.051
<v Speaker 2>be solved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there are people who are </v>

1172
00:54:15.051 --> 00:54:17.000
<v Speaker 2>delusional or easily self deceived who </v>
<v Speaker 2>either would be lying and,</v>

1173
00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:21.030
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so convinced of the truth of their lives</v>

1174
00:54:21.031 --> 00:54:24.720
<v Speaker 2>that they would pass this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this lie detector presumably.</v>

1175
00:54:25.290 --> 00:54:30.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there are people who are so </v>

1176
00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:33.181
<v Speaker 2>sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suggestible that they can be led to </v>

1177
00:54:33.181 --> 00:54:33.181
<v Speaker 2>believe something that's not true.</v>

1178
00:54:33.181 --> 00:54:37.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean they'd be the people who can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>convinced that you get these false </v>

1179
00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:39.060
<v Speaker 2>confessions of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in response to a crime.</v>

1180
00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:39.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1181
00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:41.520
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the strangest things in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

1182
00:54:41.521 --> 00:54:42.080
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1183
00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:45.960
<v Speaker 2>when someone gets murdered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this doesn't get publicized very much.</v>

1184
00:54:45.961 --> 00:54:50.961
<v Speaker 2>But it's a very common experience of </v>
<v Speaker 2>police officers or police departments to</v>

1185
00:54:51.301 --> 00:54:56.301
<v Speaker 2>hear from people in the community who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are confessing to the crime and they </v>

1186
00:54:56.301 --> 00:54:57.900
<v Speaker 2>didn't commit it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just come in and they say,</v>

1187
00:54:57.901 --> 00:54:58.560
<v Speaker 2>I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>

1188
00:54:58.561 --> 00:54:59.780
<v Speaker 2>they give all this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1189
00:54:59.781 --> 00:55:02.400
<v Speaker 2>this bogus account of what happened and </v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1190
00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:05.190
<v Speaker 2>and this is a sign of mental illness or </v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1191
00:55:05.630 --> 00:55:10.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are people I'm seeking attention </v>

1192
00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:13.431
<v Speaker 2>and some morbid way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are people clearly who are so </v>

1193
00:55:13.431 --> 00:55:17.691
<v Speaker 2>suggestible that they can either lead </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves to believe or be led by </v>

1194
00:55:20.311 --> 00:55:23.190
<v Speaker 2>others to believe that they've done </v>
<v Speaker 2>things they didn't do.</v>

1195
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:23.870
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in,</v>

1196
00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:28.200
<v Speaker 2>in just shocking detail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was another New Yorker article on,</v>

1197
00:55:28.201 --> 00:55:30.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1198
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:33.300
<v Speaker 2>I think it was written by William </v>
<v Speaker 2>Languish,</v>

1199
00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:33.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1200
00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:35.460
<v Speaker 2>this years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1201
00:55:35.461 --> 00:55:36.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a,</v>

1202
00:55:36.210 --> 00:55:41.210
<v Speaker 2>a satanic panic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a case where a guy got a accused of </v>

1203
00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:46.050
<v Speaker 2>running a satanic cult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1204
00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:49.740
<v Speaker 2>by I think his daughter who was in </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypnosis,</v>

1205
00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:51.870
<v Speaker 2>hypnosis recovery therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1206
00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:57.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she had been led down the primrose </v>

1207
00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:59.961
<v Speaker 2>path by her therapist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so she obviously was fairly </v>

1208
00:55:59.961 --> 00:56:04.461
<v Speaker 2>suggestible and she recalled the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>lurid,</v>

1209
00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:11.010
<v Speaker 2>just insane Rosemary's baby style,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1210
00:56:11.011 --> 00:56:11.970
<v Speaker 2>cult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1211
00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:17.120
<v Speaker 2>imaginable going on in her town where </v>
<v Speaker 2>the friends of dad were coming over and </v>

1212
00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:21.711
<v Speaker 2>raping everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was a human sacrifice of </v>

1213
00:56:21.711 --> 00:56:22.240
<v Speaker 2>infants and the infants were buried by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the barn and um,</v>

1214
00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:23.500
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1215
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:28.980
<v Speaker 2>the dad was so suggestible that he just </v>
<v Speaker 2>confessed and he was just,</v>

1216
00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:33.160
<v Speaker 2>he and he was given more details and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>went to prison.</v>

1217
00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:35.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is this now an old article.</v>

1218
00:56:35.141 --> 00:56:37.870
<v Speaker 2>It's probably like 10 or 15 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this guy,</v>

1219
00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:40.000
<v Speaker 2>this guy just fully confessed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1220
00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:41.320
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1221
00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:45.340
<v Speaker 2>the journalist I believe was language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1222
00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:50.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the end they actually did a Ted guy </v>

1223
00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:50.900
<v Speaker 2>is now in prison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1224
00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:52.930
<v Speaker 2>The process is completed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Justice has been done.</v>

1225
00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:55.300
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the daughter convinced that her,</v>

1226
00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:59.500
<v Speaker 2>her dad has a satanic monster and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

1227
00:56:59.501 --> 00:57:04.501
<v Speaker 2>as he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's now in prison and they went in </v>

1228
00:57:04.501 --> 00:57:07.441
<v Speaker 2>and interviewed him asking followup </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions with just details that they </v>

1229
00:57:07.691 --> 00:57:08.500
<v Speaker 2>made up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1230
00:57:08.501 --> 00:57:13.501
<v Speaker 2>Because they began to suspect that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was just this kind of suggestibility </v>

1231
00:57:13.501 --> 00:57:13.501
<v Speaker 2>machine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1232
00:57:13.501 --> 00:57:17.191
<v Speaker 2>Who just would cop to anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they went in and they just made </v>

1233
00:57:17.191 --> 00:57:17.350
<v Speaker 2>up stuff like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1234
00:57:17.351 --> 00:57:18.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1235
00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:20.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few more details want to iron out.</v>

1236
00:57:20.651 --> 00:57:22.420
<v Speaker 2>Your daughter said that there was a time</v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

1237
00:57:22.421 --> 00:57:23.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got a,</v>

1238
00:57:23.411 --> 00:57:27.500
<v Speaker 2>you brought in a horse and riding on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>horse and um,</v>

1239
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:28.570
<v Speaker 2>and then you killed the horse.</v>

1240
00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:28.840
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1241
00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:34.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm making these details up because I </v>

1242
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.230
<v Speaker 2>don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1243
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that they just concocted.</v>

1244
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.630
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

1245
00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:35.170
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1246
00:57:35.171 --> 00:57:35.860
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1247
00:57:35.861 --> 00:57:36.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1248
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.020
<v Speaker 2>and he just copped to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

1249
00:57:38.021 --> 00:57:43.021
<v Speaker 2>it became like a twilight zone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a perfect twilight zone </v>

1250
00:57:43.021 --> 00:57:45.121
<v Speaker 2>episode where they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like now you realize that this guy has </v>

1251
00:57:45.121 --> 00:57:45.940
<v Speaker 2>been put away is just saying yes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

1252
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:46.660
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

1253
00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:49.270
<v Speaker 2>that's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so clearly that they resolve it.</v>

1254
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:51.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1255
00:57:51.431 --> 00:57:56.431
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he ever wrote any </v>
<v Speaker 2>followup on this because this as I </v>

1256
00:57:56.431 --> 00:57:56.800
<v Speaker 2>recall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this,</v>

1257
00:57:56.890 --> 00:57:58.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like a 15 year old story.</v>

1258
00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:01.720
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they ended with like,</v>

1259
00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:06.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the twilight zone moment where now you </v>

1260
00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:06.740
<v Speaker 2>realize this guy is innocent and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying yes to everything.</v>

1261
00:58:07.090 --> 00:58:09.840
<v Speaker 2>And his daughter crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she shares his jeans.</v>

1262
00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:11.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>

1263
00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:12.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't recall what the daughter did </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>

1264
00:58:13.050 --> 00:58:14.710
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

1265
00:58:14.711 --> 00:58:16.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>

1266
00:58:16.261 --> 00:58:18.670
<v Speaker 2>the story and perhaps there's more to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the story,</v>

1267
00:58:18.671 --> 00:58:21.280
<v Speaker 2>but the story on his face was totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>exculpatory,</v>

1268
00:58:21.281 --> 00:58:26.281
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the reader experience was you got </v>

1269
00:58:26.281 --> 00:58:26.281
<v Speaker 2>to let this guy out of prison tomorrow </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

1270
00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:31.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucked and he needed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he gets out and he's mine is probably</v>

1271
00:58:31.331 --> 00:58:36.331
<v Speaker 2>so screwed up by this whole experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if he really does believe that he </v>

1272
00:58:36.331 --> 00:58:39.580
<v Speaker 2>ran these satanic rituals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the guilt and shame of it all.</v>

1273
00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:41.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're assuming that his mind </v>
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>

1274
00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:47.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is the thing that I wonder </v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people were like functionally </v>

1275
00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:48.130
<v Speaker 2>deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deeply damaged,</v>

1276
00:58:48.370 --> 00:58:50.870
<v Speaker 2>but they're functional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're there,</v>

1277
00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:53.590
<v Speaker 2>they're going to the same schools and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you go to,</v>

1278
00:58:53.591 --> 00:58:56.800
<v Speaker 2>they work where you work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're barely a person.</v>

1279
00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:59.260
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all their connections are all fucked up.</v>

1280
00:58:59.261 --> 00:59:01.150
<v Speaker 2>Like if you went into the back wiring or</v>
<v Speaker 2>their head,</v>

1281
00:59:01.390 --> 00:59:03.340
<v Speaker 2>if you were like an appliance repair </v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

1282
00:59:03.341 --> 00:59:04.750
<v Speaker 2>like sell your TV's not working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

1283
00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:07.660
<v Speaker 2>Let me go back here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is all this mean?</v>

1284
00:59:07.661 --> 00:59:12.661
<v Speaker 2>How many people are like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are just sort of kind of </v>

1285
00:59:12.661 --> 00:59:15.181
<v Speaker 2>functional?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My question is if we do get to a point </v>

1286
00:59:15.181 --> 00:59:18.361
<v Speaker 2>where you could read minds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if you go into their minds and you </v>

1287
00:59:18.361 --> 00:59:18.361
<v Speaker 2>find out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1288
00:59:18.361 --> 00:59:21.010
<v Speaker 2>this is what they really think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is not a liar,</v>

1289
00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:22.190
<v Speaker 2>this is a person</v>

1290
00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:27.200
<v Speaker 3>who's seeing things that aren't there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a person who's completely </v>

1291
00:59:27.231 --> 00:59:29.240
<v Speaker 3>delusional,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people that have these.</v>

1292
00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:34.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm hallucinating a hallucinogenic </v>
<v Speaker 3>visions like some people have like </v>

1293
00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:39.690
<v Speaker 3>really like deeply troubling visual </v>
<v Speaker 3>images that they see match.</v>

1294
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:44.710
<v Speaker 3>If he's poor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking people really are seeing that </v>

1295
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.710
<v Speaker 3>and if you could read their mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would.</v>

1296
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:48.950
<v Speaker 3>You would literally be inside the mind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a person whose mind isn't functioning</v>

1297
00:59:49.330 --> 00:59:52.040
<v Speaker 3>and we can get sort of an understanding </v>
<v Speaker 3>about what that would be like.</v>

1298
00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:52.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1299
00:59:53.330 --> 00:59:58.330
<v Speaker 3>this has been done in a very simple way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where you with schizophrenia who mostly </v>

1300
00:59:58.330 --> 01:00:01.871
<v Speaker 3>have auditory hallucinations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can now detect auditory cortex </v>

1301
01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.790
<v Speaker 3>activity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so mishaps,</v>

1302
01:00:04.791 --> 01:00:07.470
<v Speaker 3>misinterpretations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just know that they're.</v>

1303
01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:11.300
<v Speaker 3>They're auditory cortices are active in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same way that when you're hearing my</v>

1304
01:00:11.301 --> 01:00:12.500
<v Speaker 3>voice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be active.</v>

1305
01:00:12.830 --> 01:00:14.870
<v Speaker 3>When they're hearing internal voices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's active.</v>

1306
01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:17.060
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>

1307
01:00:17.090 --> 01:00:18.140
<v Speaker 3>Which is what you would expect.</v>

1308
01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:21.560
<v Speaker 3>Maybe be the surprise would be the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>way if it,</v>

1309
01:00:21.561 --> 01:00:24.860
<v Speaker 3>if nothing was going on and auditory </v>
<v Speaker 3>cortex and they were hearing voices,</v>

1310
01:00:24.861 --> 01:00:29.861
<v Speaker 3>then wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that would be more surprising to </v>

1311
01:00:29.861 --> 01:00:29.990
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fascinating.</v>

1312
01:00:29.991 --> 01:00:34.991
<v Speaker 3>You can watch the hallucinations take </v>
<v Speaker 3>place inside the mind of the person and </v>

1313
01:00:36.981 --> 01:00:41.981
<v Speaker 3>you can stimulate hallucinations in </v>
<v Speaker 3>people you can stimulate out of body </v>

1314
01:00:41.981 --> 01:00:46.601
<v Speaker 3>experiences and people with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with transcranial magnetic stimulation </v>

1315
01:00:46.601 --> 01:00:46.601
<v Speaker 3>and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1316
01:00:46.601 --> 01:00:51.000
<v Speaker 3>how do they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've been able to do that recently </v>

1317
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.260
<v Speaker 3>and to try to give people the same sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of experience that they claim to have </v>

1318
01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:56.240
<v Speaker 3>had when like on the operating table.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what people have a lot,</v>

1319
01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:57.410
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they're almost dead.</v>

1320
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:58.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1321
01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:59.450
<v Speaker 3>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>

1322
01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:01.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>

1323
01:01:01.471 --> 01:01:03.150
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1324
01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:08.300
<v Speaker 2>there's an area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe this is the temporal parietal </v>

1325
01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:08.820
<v Speaker 2>junction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is sort of like here,</v>

1326
01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:14.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're pointing to a lot of time </v>

1327
01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:15.330
<v Speaker 2>talking to you and not talking to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>millions.</v>

1328
01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.490
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1329
01:01:17.730 --> 01:01:19.020
<v Speaker 2>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1330
01:01:19.021 --> 01:01:22.010
<v Speaker 2>where the temporal lobe and the parietal</v>
<v Speaker 2>lobes intersect.</v>

1331
01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:24.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

1332
01:01:24.361 --> 01:01:29.361
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was first discovered in </v>

1333
01:01:29.361 --> 01:01:32.650
<v Speaker 2>surgery on an epileptic where they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so are you in,</v>

1334
01:01:33.150 --> 01:01:38.150
<v Speaker 2>in any kind of resection of the brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the people are awake because </v>

1335
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:39.130
<v Speaker 2>there's no pain sensors in the brain so </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

1336
01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:44.140
<v Speaker 2>you can stay awake while you're getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain surgery and they tend to keep you </v>

1337
01:01:44.191 --> 01:01:47.400
<v Speaker 2>awake if they're going to be removing </v>
<v Speaker 2>areas of the brain,</v>

1338
01:01:47.401 --> 01:01:52.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say a tumor or the focus of an </v>

1339
01:01:52.401 --> 01:01:52.401
<v Speaker 2>epileptic seizure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1340
01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:55.770
<v Speaker 2>and they don't want to remove working </v>
<v Speaker 2>parts,</v>

1341
01:01:55.771 --> 01:01:57.700
<v Speaker 2>especially the language part.</v>

1342
01:01:57.700 --> 01:01:58.730
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're,</v>

1343
01:01:58.731 --> 01:02:00.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're keeping people awake and they're</v>

1344
01:02:00.751 --> 01:02:02.850
<v Speaker 2>probing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1345
01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:08.060
<v Speaker 2>those areas of the cortex to see what </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's correlated within the person's </v>

1346
01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:10.830
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you said there having them talk,</v>

1347
01:02:10.831 --> 01:02:12.240
<v Speaker 2>they're having them answer questions and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1348
01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:17.300
<v Speaker 2>and they're putting a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>current in that area which would be </v>

1349
01:02:17.641 --> 01:02:22.070
<v Speaker 2>disruptive of normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1350
01:02:22.170 --> 01:02:27.170
<v Speaker 2>you can see there they're mapping the </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost entirely mapping language cortex </v>

1351
01:02:27.170 --> 01:02:31.971
<v Speaker 2>when they do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there have been experiences where </v>

1352
01:02:31.971 --> 01:02:32.580
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1353
01:02:32.581 --> 01:02:36.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm a neurosurgeon will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will put a little current in,</v>

1354
01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:41.220
<v Speaker 2>in an area near this region of the brain</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people will have this out of body </v>

1355
01:02:42.481 --> 01:02:43.990
<v Speaker 2>experience where they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1356
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.800
<v Speaker 2>up in the corner of the room looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>down on their bodies or um,</v>

1357
01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:50.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the classic,</v>

1358
01:02:50.131 --> 01:02:55.131
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>astral projection experience where the </v>

1359
01:02:55.131 --> 01:02:55.131
<v Speaker 2>or the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1360
01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:56.930
<v Speaker 2>the near death experience where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1361
01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:01.960
<v Speaker 2>people have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have risen out of their body or seem to </v>

1362
01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:04.521
<v Speaker 2>have risen out of their body and </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness now seems to be located </v>

1363
01:03:04.521 --> 01:03:04.521
<v Speaker 2>elsewhere.</v>

1364
01:03:04.521 --> 01:03:05.800
<v Speaker 2>And that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1365
01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:08.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just,</v>

1366
01:03:08.131 --> 01:03:08.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1367
01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:12.330
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that region of the brain is,</v>

1368
01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:15.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1369
01:03:16.890 --> 01:03:19.170
<v Speaker 2>virtually every region of the cortex </v>
<v Speaker 2>does many,</v>

1370
01:03:19.171 --> 01:03:20.070
<v Speaker 2>many things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

1371
01:03:20.071 --> 01:03:22.340
<v Speaker 2>there's no one region of the brain that </v>
<v Speaker 2>does one thing.</v>

1372
01:03:22.341 --> 01:03:23.940
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple of exceptions to this,</v>

1373
01:03:23.941 --> 01:03:25.190
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1374
01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:26.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the burden,</v>

1375
01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:31.800
<v Speaker 2>the whole brain is participating in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in much of what we do and it's just a </v>

1376
01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:35.180
<v Speaker 2>greater or lesser degrees of activity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in terms of your,</v>

1377
01:03:35.181 --> 01:03:37.440
<v Speaker 2>your mapping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body in space,</v>

1378
01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:38.730
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1379
01:03:38.731 --> 01:03:43.731
<v Speaker 2>the parietal lobe is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has got a lot to do with that and when </v>

1380
01:03:43.731 --> 01:03:47.430
<v Speaker 2>that gets disturbed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have weird experiences.</v>

1381
01:03:47.431 --> 01:03:52.431
<v Speaker 2>You can have the experience of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not recognizing your body or parts </v>

1382
01:03:52.681 --> 01:03:53.500
<v Speaker 2>of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

1383
01:03:53.501 --> 01:03:53.820
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1384
01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:57.780
<v Speaker 2>you don't really like Alien Hand </v>
<v Speaker 2>Syndrome where you'd like your left arm.</v>

1385
01:03:58.230 --> 01:04:01.920
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seems seems like another person's arm,</v>

1386
01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:02.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people,</v>

1387
01:04:03.010 --> 01:04:05.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to disown half their body.</v>

1388
01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:07.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1389
01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:11.890
<v Speaker 2>you can trick people with visual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1390
01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:15.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>changes of display like you can,</v>

1391
01:04:15.341 --> 01:04:19.780
<v Speaker 2>you can wear headgear where you can make</v>
<v Speaker 2>me feel like it's like a,</v>

1392
01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:23.850
<v Speaker 2>it's called the body swapping illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can feel like I am located.</v>

1393
01:04:23.851 --> 01:04:26.460
<v Speaker 2>My consciousness is located in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

1394
01:04:26.790 --> 01:04:28.070
<v Speaker 2>Looking back at me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

1395
01:04:28.071 --> 01:04:31.230
<v Speaker 2>there's a clever experiment that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>did where,</v>

1396
01:04:31.610 --> 01:04:36.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is the ultimate extension of what </v>

1397
01:04:36.610 --> 01:04:39.030
<v Speaker 2>has long been called the rubber hand </v>
<v Speaker 2>illusion where you can,</v>

1398
01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:41.310
<v Speaker 2>you can put like my two hands are on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>table.</v>

1399
01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:46.311
<v Speaker 2>Now you can set up an experiment where </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you put a rubber hand,</v>

1400
01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:47.620
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1401
01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:50.670
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you set this up in a way where I am,</v>

1402
01:04:50.850 --> 01:04:54.640
<v Speaker 2>I am assuming I have my two hands here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1403
01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:56.070
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1404
01:04:56.340 --> 01:05:00.190
<v Speaker 2>you can put a rubber hand in its place </v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

1405
01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:03.230
<v Speaker 2>touch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>touch this rubber hand with it,</v>

1406
01:05:03.231 --> 01:05:04.470
<v Speaker 2>with a brush,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1407
01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:04.910
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>

1408
01:05:04.990 --> 01:05:07.110
<v Speaker 2>so I'm seeing the rubber hand get </v>
<v Speaker 2>touched.</v>

1409
01:05:07.111 --> 01:05:12.111
<v Speaker 2>W W with a brush and I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can feel like my hand is being </v>

1410
01:05:13.951 --> 01:05:18.951
<v Speaker 2>touched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like if my hand is being </v>

1411
01:05:18.951 --> 01:05:20.451
<v Speaker 2>touched,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my hand is elsewhere under the table </v>

1412
01:05:20.451 --> 01:05:20.451
<v Speaker 2>being touched with a brush at the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1413
01:05:20.451 --> 01:05:23.170
<v Speaker 2>I can feel like my hand is now the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rubber hand,</v>

1414
01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:23.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could,</v>

1415
01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:28.680
<v Speaker 2>so I can feel like my hand is in place </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the rubber hand based on visual and </v>

1416
01:05:29.561 --> 01:05:31.110
<v Speaker 2>tactile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1417
01:05:31.690 --> 01:05:33.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the simultaneity of my scene,</v>

1418
01:05:33.311 --> 01:05:35.890
<v Speaker 2>the rubber hand get touched with a brush</v>
<v Speaker 2>and my feeling my hand,</v>

1419
01:05:35.891 --> 01:05:37.750
<v Speaker 2>which is now under the table being </v>
<v Speaker 2>touched with the brush.</v>

1420
01:05:38.330 --> 01:05:40.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not explaining that setup great,</v>

1421
01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:44.530
<v Speaker 2>but people can look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you can do the same thing to a,</v>

1422
01:05:45.070 --> 01:05:50.070
<v Speaker 2>to the ultimate degree with this video </v>
<v Speaker 2>goggles display where I'm getting input,</v>

1423
01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:54.250
<v Speaker 2>visual input from where you're standing.</v>

1424
01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:56.950
<v Speaker 2>So like if you come up to shake my hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1425
01:05:57.310 --> 01:06:02.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm seeing you come up to me and shake </v>

1426
01:06:02.310 --> 01:06:04.741
<v Speaker 2>my hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm seeing it from your point of </v>

1427
01:06:04.741 --> 01:06:04.741
<v Speaker 2>view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1428
01:06:04.741 --> 01:06:04.741
<v Speaker 2>So like I'm getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1429
01:06:04.741 --> 01:06:04.990
<v Speaker 2>visual input from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

1430
01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:10.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I now feel like I'm walking up to me </v>

1431
01:06:10.030 --> 01:06:12.481
<v Speaker 2>shaking my hand and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can just kind of feel like you are </v>

1432
01:06:12.481 --> 01:06:14.210
<v Speaker 2>consciousness is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is out,</v>

1433
01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:15.910
<v Speaker 2>is over there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1434
01:06:15.911 --> 01:06:17.850
<v Speaker 2>outside your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1435
01:06:18.790 --> 01:06:20.590
<v Speaker 2>and it's just to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that our,</v>

1436
01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:26.100
<v Speaker 2>our sense of self,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our sense of being located where we are </v>

1437
01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:29.700
<v Speaker 2>in our heads is largely a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in some cases almost entirely a </v>

1438
01:06:32.921 --> 01:06:34.630
<v Speaker 2>matter of a vision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1439
01:06:34.631 --> 01:06:37.570
<v Speaker 2>It's a matter of fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that you feel you're over there</v>

1440
01:06:37.571 --> 01:06:38.590
<v Speaker 2>is because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1441
01:06:38.591 --> 01:06:40.540
<v Speaker 2>that's where your eyes are here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're behind your eyes.</v>

1442
01:06:40.541 --> 01:06:44.530
<v Speaker 2>You feel like you're behind your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you and tricks of a vision can,</v>

1443
01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:45.540
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1444
01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:48.400
<v Speaker 2>seem to dislodge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1445
01:06:49.090 --> 01:06:51.040
<v Speaker 2>that's that sense of being located </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1446
01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:56.920
<v Speaker 3>So stimulating one area of the brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>electrically has been shown,</v>

1447
01:06:57.411 --> 01:06:59.180
<v Speaker 3>like even just transdermally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the,</v>

1448
01:06:59.230 --> 01:07:00.440
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do they do?</v>

1449
01:07:00.441 --> 01:07:02.030
<v Speaker 3>They put little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>little,</v>

1450
01:07:02.031 --> 01:07:04.340
<v Speaker 3>what are those things called?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those little glue on things.</v>

1451
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:06.770
<v Speaker 3>Electrodes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they can.</v>

1452
01:07:07.450 --> 01:07:10.810
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about eeg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're reading from the brain,</v>

1453
01:07:10.811 --> 01:07:10.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1454
01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:16.120
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually talking about some new </v>

1455
01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:17.450
<v Speaker 3>experiments that they've been doing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were talking about on radio lab.</v>

1456
01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:22.720
<v Speaker 3>And apparently there's a bunch of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it yourselfers that or if you ever </v>

1457
01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:23.100
<v Speaker 3>listened to radio lab.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazing Awhile.</v>

1458
01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:28.180
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing podcasts like one of the best </v>

1459
01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:30.041
<v Speaker 3>our.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it has this one episode that dealt </v>

1460
01:07:30.041 --> 01:07:33.401
<v Speaker 3>with people learning certain skills </v>
<v Speaker 3>while the outside of their brain is </v>

1461
01:07:33.401 --> 01:07:34.340
<v Speaker 3>being stimulated with like a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>electrode.</v>

1462
01:07:35.030 --> 01:07:40.030
<v Speaker 3>And this woman who was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reporters went to a sniper training </v>

1463
01:07:40.041 --> 01:07:45.041
<v Speaker 3>thing where they set up the scenario and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they give you like a fake gun and you </v>

1464
01:07:45.041 --> 01:07:45.080
<v Speaker 3>pointed the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He tried to hit the targets as all these</v>

1465
01:07:45.081 --> 01:07:46.560
<v Speaker 3>things are happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1466
01:07:46.610 --> 01:07:47.750
<v Speaker 3>she did it once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1467
01:07:47.751 --> 01:07:49.850
<v Speaker 3>Nine Volt Nirvana is the name of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>episode.</v>

1468
01:07:49.851 --> 01:07:50.090
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1469
01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:53.840
<v Speaker 3>It is an outstanding episode.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so fascinating.</v>

1470
01:07:53.841 --> 01:07:55.070
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she goes through one.</v>

1471
01:07:55.071 --> 01:07:57.440
<v Speaker 3>She's terrible at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She just sucks terribly.</v>

1472
01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:02.740
<v Speaker 3>Then they hook her up to this machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They attached this electrode to a </v>

1473
01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:06.821
<v Speaker 3>certain certain area of her brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stimulate one area of her brain and she </v>

1474
01:08:06.821 --> 01:08:08.360
<v Speaker 3>goes through it like a fucking sniper </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

1475
01:08:08.361 --> 01:08:10.550
<v Speaker 3>slows down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She gets 20 out of 20.</v>

1476
01:08:11.030 --> 01:08:16.030
<v Speaker 3>So she goes from being a complete </v>
<v Speaker 3>failure to being awesome at it and some </v>

1477
01:08:16.030 --> 01:08:16.030
<v Speaker 3>weird state</v>

1478
01:08:16.030 --> 01:08:20.980
<v Speaker 2>that she described and they're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about of the US government's using it </v>

1479
01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:24.671
<v Speaker 2>and they're trying to train soldiers and</v>
<v Speaker 2>snipers and people to try to understand </v>

1480
01:08:24.671 --> 01:08:29.411
<v Speaker 2>this mindset and try to achieve this </v>
<v Speaker 2>mindset and that they're trying to do </v>

1481
01:08:29.411 --> 01:08:32.801
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's certain companies that are </v>

1482
01:08:32.801 --> 01:08:33.110
<v Speaker 2>experimenting with it at least by </v>
<v Speaker 2>stimulating the outside of your head.</v>

1483
01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:38.760
<v Speaker 2>Was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I could not know this particular </v>

1484
01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:38.760
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember hearing that title though,</v>

1485
01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:43.691
<v Speaker 2>but the transcranial magnetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>stimulation is magnetic energy,</v>

1486
01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:46.160
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1487
01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:48.860
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the flip side of electrical energy.</v>

1488
01:08:48.861 --> 01:08:51.860
<v Speaker 2>So if you apply a big magnet to the side</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your head,</v>

1489
01:08:52.250 --> 01:08:56.060
<v Speaker 2>you are changing the electrical </v>
<v Speaker 2>properties of your cortex.</v>

1490
01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:57.500
<v Speaker 2>Is that what they're doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1491
01:08:57.501 --> 01:08:57.850
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1492
01:08:57.851 --> 01:09:02.851
<v Speaker 2>I'm wondering if they've just made a </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcranial magnetic device so small </v>

1493
01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:05.640
<v Speaker 2>that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's um,</v>

1494
01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:07.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's Magneto is direct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Current.</v>

1495
01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:08.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1496
01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:09.050
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1497
01:09:09.051 --> 01:09:12.260
<v Speaker 2>Direct current stimulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Transcranial direct current stimulation.</v>

1498
01:09:12.261 --> 01:09:13.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it's called.</v>

1499
01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:15.480
<v Speaker 2>TCD will say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1500
01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:18.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm unaware of the specifics of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

1501
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:20.210
<v Speaker 2>it's been true for a long time that </v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

1502
01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:21.750
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with um,</v>

1503
01:09:22.190 --> 01:09:27.190
<v Speaker 2>a much bigger device in a lab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can change a person's performance </v>

1504
01:09:27.261 --> 01:09:30.880
<v Speaker 2>for good or for ill on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on various tasks just by and,</v>

1505
01:09:30.910 --> 01:09:35.910
<v Speaker 2>and it's just an electromagnet which is </v>
<v Speaker 2>focusing its energy on various areas of </v>

1506
01:09:37.610 --> 01:09:39.470
<v Speaker 2>the cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So bizarre.</v>

1507
01:09:39.530 --> 01:09:41.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what we're doing,</v>

1508
01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:46.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are disrupting a neural firing,</v>

1509
01:09:47.330 --> 01:09:52.330
<v Speaker 2>but your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can disrupt areas that are </v>

1510
01:09:52.330 --> 01:09:54.470
<v Speaker 2>inhibiting other things you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>release.</v>

1511
01:09:54.471 --> 01:09:56.210
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can be,</v>

1512
01:09:56.480 --> 01:10:01.480
<v Speaker 2>it's not always synonymous with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>degradation of performance mean you </v>

1513
01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:05.681
<v Speaker 2>could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could increase performance on a </v>

1514
01:10:05.681 --> 01:10:08.021
<v Speaker 2>certain task by taking one region of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain offline are more or less offline.</v>

1515
01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:11.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not,</v>

1516
01:10:11.811 --> 01:10:16.811
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not aware of how far they've taken </v>

1517
01:10:16.811 --> 01:10:18.340
<v Speaker 2>it in terms of doing anything that seems</v>
<v Speaker 2>useful in terms of performing something.</v>

1518
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:23.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean what the research I'm more aware </v>
<v Speaker 2>of is just using this to figure out what</v>

1519
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:28.990
<v Speaker 2>various regions of the brain are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I a mapping function because you </v>

1520
01:10:28.990 --> 01:10:31.340
<v Speaker 2>want to see if I disrupt area and area </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

1521
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:36.790
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does that show up in an experiment </v>

1522
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:38.330
<v Speaker 2>and that gives you some clue as to as to</v>
<v Speaker 2>what that region is doing,</v>

1523
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:43.390
<v Speaker 2>at least in that task.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As much as we know about the mind and </v>

1524
01:10:43.390 --> 01:10:43.390
<v Speaker 2>being able to do things like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like overall,</v>

1525
01:10:43.390 --> 01:10:48.341
<v Speaker 2>if you had a really like trying to map </v>
<v Speaker 2>out the exact functions of the mind and </v>

1526
01:10:48.341 --> 01:10:52.181
<v Speaker 2>how everything works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how far do you think we are along the </v>

1527
01:10:52.181 --> 01:10:55.151
<v Speaker 2>understanding that we halfway to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>we understand half of how the brain </v>

1528
01:10:55.151 --> 01:10:55.151
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>

1529
01:10:55.950 --> 01:11:00.950
<v Speaker 2>Not what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't even know how to quantify it </v>

1530
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:03.560
<v Speaker 2>at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just we know a ton,</v>

1531
01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:08.740
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we know how we know a lot about </v>

1532
01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:09.710
<v Speaker 2>where languages and where facial </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognition is.</v>

1533
01:11:09.711 --> 01:11:11.030
<v Speaker 2>And so your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1534
01:11:11.810 --> 01:11:15.270
<v Speaker 2>your visual cortex been really well </v>
<v Speaker 2>mapped and um,</v>

1535
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:21.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know a lot and the last 150 years </v>

1536
01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:23.890
<v Speaker 2>based on just the neurological injury </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1537
01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:26.290
<v Speaker 2>and then in the last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1538
01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:31.640
<v Speaker 2>decades based on imaging technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know regions of the brain that,</v>

1539
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:35.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely governed language and regions</v>

1540
01:11:35.191 --> 01:11:38.280
<v Speaker 2>of the brain that have basically nothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do with language,</v>

1541
01:11:38.281 --> 01:11:39.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to take one example,</v>

1542
01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:42.070
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we know a lot about memory and we,</v>

1543
01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:44.730
<v Speaker 2>we know about a lot about the different </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of memory,</v>

1544
01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:48.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's um,</v>

1545
01:11:49.290 --> 01:11:50.100
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1546
01:11:50.190 --> 01:11:51.780
<v Speaker 2>I think there's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's much more.</v>

1547
01:11:51.781 --> 01:11:56.781
<v Speaker 2>We don't know what's even more um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I kind of the greatest friction </v>

1548
01:12:00.541 --> 01:12:01.020
<v Speaker 2>in the system.</v>

1549
01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:04.830
<v Speaker 2>There's not often a lot to do with what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we know.</v>

1550
01:12:04.890 --> 01:12:05.580
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like the,</v>

1551
01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:07.740
<v Speaker 2>like knowing is not enough for certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1552
01:12:07.741 --> 01:12:12.741
<v Speaker 2>It's not because he tried to intervene </v>
<v Speaker 2>is another part of the process,</v>

1553
01:12:13.801 --> 01:12:15.730
<v Speaker 2>which where there are no guarantees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>

1554
01:12:15.731 --> 01:12:16.140
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1555
01:12:16.141 --> 01:12:21.141
<v Speaker 2>the way we can intervene in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>functioning of the brain is incredibly </v>

1556
01:12:21.141 --> 01:12:21.640
<v Speaker 2>crude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1557
01:12:21.810 --> 01:12:25.500
<v Speaker 2>pharmacologically or with surgery or </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a device like that.</v>

1558
01:12:25.950 --> 01:12:28.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to get,</v>

1559
01:12:28.710 --> 01:12:33.710
<v Speaker 2>to get from a place of really refined </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge to a place of being able to do</v>

1560
01:12:34.801 --> 01:12:36.690
<v Speaker 2>something we want to do with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge,</v>

1561
01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:38.350
<v Speaker 2>that's another step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

1562
01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:39.960
<v Speaker 2>that's a step that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1563
01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:41.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1564
01:12:41.161 --> 01:12:46.161
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason to think that we're </v>

1565
01:12:46.161 --> 01:12:46.161
<v Speaker 2>not going to take it at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's an additional complexity to get</v>

1566
01:12:46.161 --> 01:12:48.930
<v Speaker 2>inside the head safely and help people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1567
01:12:48.931 --> 01:12:50.370
<v Speaker 2>or improve function.</v>

1568
01:12:50.730 --> 01:12:52.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1569
01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:54.670
<v Speaker 2>even if you know a lot about what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1570
01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:57.180
<v Speaker 2>those areas of the brain do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't,</v>

1571
01:12:57.710 --> 01:13:00.870
<v Speaker 2>we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We haven't cracked the neural code.</v>

1572
01:13:00.871 --> 01:13:05.871
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know how consciousness is </v>

1573
01:13:05.871 --> 01:13:05.871
<v Speaker 2>arising in the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1574
01:13:06.270 --> 01:13:09.630
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't know how to build a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1575
01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:15.200
<v Speaker 2>a computer that does what we do to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing of experience the world as we </v>

1576
01:13:16.921 --> 01:13:20.160
<v Speaker 2>experience it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1577
01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:25.820
<v Speaker 2>and we may be going down paths where we </v>
<v Speaker 2>will build it more by happenstance,</v>

1578
01:13:26.221 --> 01:13:27.500
<v Speaker 2>whereas like we will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1579
01:13:27.610 --> 01:13:30.780
<v Speaker 2>when we build it and not quite know how </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's doing,</v>

1580
01:13:30.781 --> 01:13:35.781
<v Speaker 2>what it's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seeming to do more or less what </v>

1581
01:13:35.781 --> 01:13:36.360
<v Speaker 2>we do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be doing it very differently.</v>

1582
01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:36.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>

1583
01:13:37.010 --> 01:13:42.010
<v Speaker 2>there are two paths are at least two </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinct paths in artificial </v>

1584
01:13:42.010 --> 01:13:46.521
<v Speaker 2>intelligence and one path could take a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could try to emulate what the brain is </v>

1585
01:13:47.101 --> 01:13:50.670
<v Speaker 2>doing and that obviously requires a real</v>
<v Speaker 2>detailed understanding of what the brain</v>

1586
01:13:50.671 --> 01:13:51.060
<v Speaker 2>is doing.</v>

1587
01:13:51.330 --> 01:13:54.840
<v Speaker 2>Another path would be to just ignore the</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>

1588
01:13:54.990 --> 01:13:59.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like there's no reason why </v>

1589
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:02.330
<v Speaker 2>artificially intelligent machines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even machines that are super human in </v>

1590
01:14:02.371 --> 01:14:06.890
<v Speaker 2>their capacities need to do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1591
01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:11.410
<v Speaker 2>that is similar to what we do with our </v>
<v Speaker 2>brains.</v>

1592
01:14:11.411 --> 01:14:11.950
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't,</v>

1593
01:14:11.970 --> 01:14:13.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neurochemical circus,</v>

1594
01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:17.980
<v Speaker 2>so because they're going to be organized</v>
<v Speaker 2>differently and um,</v>

1595
01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:20.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could be organized quite differently and</v>

1596
01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:22.480
<v Speaker 2>obviously made of totally different </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

1597
01:14:22.930 --> 01:14:27.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so whether you want to go down the path </v>

1598
01:14:27.930 --> 01:14:31.621
<v Speaker 2>of emulating the brain on the basis of </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a detailed understanding of it or </v>

1599
01:14:31.751 --> 01:14:36.751
<v Speaker 2>you just want to go down the path of </v>
<v Speaker 2>maximizing intelligent behavior in </v>

1600
01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:41.390
<v Speaker 2>machines or some combination of the two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're there.</v>

1601
01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:43.550
<v Speaker 2>They're not necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1602
01:14:43.930 --> 01:14:45.950
<v Speaker 2>they're distinct and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1603
01:14:45.951 --> 01:14:50.951
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one doesn't entail really knowing that </v>

1604
01:14:50.951 --> 01:14:54.090
<v Speaker 2>much about the brain necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's really two different ways </v>

1605
01:14:54.090 --> 01:14:54.090
<v Speaker 2>they can go about it.</v>

1606
01:14:54.090 --> 01:14:55.180
<v Speaker 2>Either they could try to reproduce a </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>

1607
01:14:55.850 --> 01:14:57.150
<v Speaker 2>which people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can make.</v>

1608
01:14:57.820 --> 01:14:58.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1609
01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:01.060
<v Speaker 2>if they can make fake meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why can't they make fake brain tissue?</v>

1610
01:15:01.290 --> 01:15:03.430
<v Speaker 2>It seems like they could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1611
01:15:03.431 --> 01:15:06.340
<v Speaker 2>I know a woman got her bladder replaced </v>
<v Speaker 2>with stem cells.</v>

1612
01:15:06.341 --> 01:15:11.341
<v Speaker 2>Did you hear about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They took stem cells and recreated her </v>

1613
01:15:11.341 --> 01:15:12.310
<v Speaker 2>own bladder in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she had a bladder cancer,</v>

1614
01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:17.680
<v Speaker 2>so they built her a new bladder and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>laboratory and put her own ladder back </v>

1615
01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.980
<v Speaker 2>in her body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is sanely fascinating.</v>

1616
01:15:20.981 --> 01:15:25.981
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they can figure out how to extract a </v>

1617
01:15:25.981 --> 01:15:27.751
<v Speaker 2>little bit of brain tissue thing is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the brain is famously the most </v>

1618
01:15:27.751 --> 01:15:31.750
<v Speaker 2>complicated object in the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A bladder is essentially a bag,</v>

1619
01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's a big leap.</v>

1620
01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:36.940
<v Speaker 2>It's a big leap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not,</v>

1621
01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:39.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1622
01:15:39.310 --> 01:15:41.980
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a leap we will take and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1623
01:15:41.981 --> 01:15:46.981
<v Speaker 2>whether we take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether the May maybe a leap we take in </v>

1624
01:15:46.981 --> 01:15:51.810
<v Speaker 2>this step wise way where we build </v>
<v Speaker 2>machines down a path that is not at all </v>

1625
01:15:52.331 --> 01:15:57.331
<v Speaker 2>analogous to recreating brains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which allow us to then understand the </v>

1626
01:15:58.541 --> 01:15:59.350
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1627
01:15:59.710 --> 01:16:00.190
<v Speaker 2>totally.</v>

1628
01:16:00.250 --> 01:16:01.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

1629
01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:07.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Ray Kurtzweil sentence where we </v>

1630
01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:07.600
<v Speaker 2>can upload ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that makes any sense.</v>

1631
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a uh,</v>

1632
01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:13.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1633
01:16:13.550 --> 01:16:18.550
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think information processing is at </v>

1634
01:16:19.421 --> 01:16:23.060
<v Speaker 2>bottom what intelligence is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that is,</v>

1635
01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:27.790
<v Speaker 2>that is not really up for dispute at </v>
<v Speaker 2>this point that any,</v>

1636
01:16:27.791 --> 01:16:32.791
<v Speaker 2>any intelligence system is processing </v>
<v Speaker 2>information and our brains are doing </v>

1637
01:16:32.791 --> 01:16:33.850
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1638
01:16:34.150 --> 01:16:39.150
<v Speaker 2>and any machine that is going to exhibit</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kind of general intelligence that we</v>

1639
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:45.870
<v Speaker 2>exhibit a and surpass us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll be doing by dent of its hardware </v>

1640
01:16:47.441 --> 01:16:52.441
<v Speaker 2>and software.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something deeply analogous to what our </v>

1641
01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:52.441
<v Speaker 2>brains are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

1642
01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:56.140
<v Speaker 2>it may not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we may not get there based on,</v>

1643
01:16:56.700 --> 01:17:01.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>directly emulating what our brains are </v>

1644
01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:02.230
<v Speaker 2>doing and we may get there before we </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually understand,</v>

1645
01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:04.770
<v Speaker 2>understand our brains in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would allow us to emulate it.</v>

1646
01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:10.070
<v Speaker 2>It's always very interesting</v>

1647
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:14.930
<v Speaker 3>to me how it seems to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's always a pushes and pulls in,</v>

1648
01:17:14.931 --> 01:17:19.931
<v Speaker 3>in life and when you have things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are as horrific as factory farming and </v>

1649
01:17:20.901 --> 01:17:25.901
<v Speaker 3>people are exposed to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then there's this rebound and where </v>

1650
01:17:25.901 --> 01:17:29.201
<v Speaker 3>people were trying to find a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I always wonder like if will that be</v>

1651
01:17:29.721 --> 01:17:31.880
<v Speaker 3>the first artificial life that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>create?</v>

1652
01:17:31.881 --> 01:17:34.340
<v Speaker 3>Like Zombie cows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some made,</v>

1653
01:17:34.341 --> 01:17:39.341
<v Speaker 3>if we've figured out that meat in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lab is not good because it has to </v>

1654
01:17:39.341 --> 01:17:39.440
<v Speaker 3>actually be moving around for it to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>good for you.</v>

1655
01:17:39.441 --> 01:17:42.260
<v Speaker 3>Maybe maybe they'll come up with some </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea to just look,</v>

1656
01:17:42.261 --> 01:17:47.261
<v Speaker 3>we're going to make zombies were going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to make livestock that essentially can </v>

1657
01:17:47.261 --> 01:17:50.600
<v Speaker 3>just move forward and consume food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no thought whatsoever.</v>

1658
01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:55.780
<v Speaker 3>These are zombies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can go right up to him and you wave </v>

1659
01:17:55.780 --> 01:17:55.780
<v Speaker 3>your hand in front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't even move.</v>

1660
01:17:55.780 --> 01:17:58.700
<v Speaker 3>Is it okay to kill those and then go </v>
<v Speaker 3>from that to making artificial people?</v>

1661
01:17:59.030 --> 01:18:01.250
<v Speaker 3>Because it seems to me that artificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1662
01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:06.750
<v Speaker 3>it's going gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just a matter of how much </v>

1663
01:18:06.750 --> 01:18:09.551
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're making bladders and then </v>

1664
01:18:09.551 --> 01:18:11.351
<v Speaker 3>they're going to start making all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 3>of different tissues with stem cells to </v>

1665
01:18:11.351 --> 01:18:12.070
<v Speaker 3>try to replace body parts in Oregon's </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're,</v>

1666
01:18:12.071 --> 01:18:17.071
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna work their way through an </v>

1667
01:18:17.071 --> 01:18:17.071
<v Speaker 3>actual human body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to happen.</v>

1668
01:18:17.071 --> 01:18:17.450
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You mean a,</v>

1669
01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:20.600
<v Speaker 3>a brainless person that would be like </v>
<v Speaker 3>spare parts for,</v>

1670
01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:22.430
<v Speaker 3>for you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

1671
01:18:22.490 --> 01:18:26.390
<v Speaker 3>That's an option,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think also an artificial human,</v>

1672
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:30.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean might take a thousand years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think if we stay alive,</v>

1673
01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:35.320
<v Speaker 3>if human beings rather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if human beings continue to evolve </v>

1674
01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:36.380
<v Speaker 3>technologically within the next hundred </v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

1675
01:18:36.381 --> 01:18:39.920
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have artificial people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are completely see that people.</v>

1676
01:18:39.930 --> 01:18:42.060
<v Speaker 3>So we're going to build a biological </v>
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

1677
01:18:42.090 --> 01:18:47.090
<v Speaker 3>hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's that sense that synthesize </v>

1678
01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:47.090
<v Speaker 3>synthesized person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1679
01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:47.090
<v Speaker 3>So it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not,</v>

1680
01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:47.540
<v Speaker 3>you're not talking about the perfect </v>
<v Speaker 3>robot.</v>

1681
01:18:47.541 --> 01:18:51.620
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about an actual person </v>
<v Speaker 3>built up cell by cell,</v>

1682
01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:55.730
<v Speaker 2>yet you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

1683
01:18:56.540 --> 01:18:58.970
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason why that's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

1684
01:18:58.971 --> 01:19:02.180
<v Speaker 2>And whether or not we would do it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is another question.</v>

1685
01:19:02.181 --> 01:19:02.450
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1686
01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:07.510
<v Speaker 3>I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had this somebody would China where </v>

1687
01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:07.510
<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1688
01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:08.570
<v Speaker 3>well presumably there are limits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even in China,</v>

1689
01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:12.260
<v Speaker 3>they do an experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's already with human embryos.</v>

1690
01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:14.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what they're doing in </v>
<v Speaker 3>China.</v>

1691
01:19:14.091 --> 01:19:16.610
<v Speaker 3>I believe they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe they got the goal to have that</v>

1692
01:19:16.611 --> 01:19:21.611
<v Speaker 3>dog festival every year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see people tweet about China's a big </v>

1693
01:19:21.611 --> 01:19:22.130
<v Speaker 3>place though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't remember them all in there,</v>

1694
01:19:22.131 --> 01:19:23.210
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1695
01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:25.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that gene splicing software,</v>

1696
01:19:25.971 --> 01:19:30.971
<v Speaker 3>Chris Perrysburg to using crisper on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>human fetuses or human embryos.</v>

1697
01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:33.110
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So good luck,</v>

1698
01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:34.520
<v Speaker 3>good luck world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1699
01:19:34.521 --> 01:19:38.540
<v Speaker 3>so China is creating super athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are many issues there.</v>

1700
01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:44.270
<v Speaker 2>Mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you're talking about a changing </v>

1701
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:48.210
<v Speaker 2>the genome and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're talking about </v>

1702
01:19:48.210 --> 01:19:48.210
<v Speaker 2>changing the germ line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1703
01:19:48.210 --> 01:19:49.730
<v Speaker 2>and then it gets passed onto future </v>
<v Speaker 2>generations that,</v>

1704
01:19:49.731 --> 01:19:52.520
<v Speaker 2>that has big implications.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1705
01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:54.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see why,</v>

1706
01:19:54.850 --> 01:19:59.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean this goes to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the artificial meat </v>

1707
01:19:59.850 --> 01:19:59.850
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to,</v>

1708
01:19:59.850 --> 01:20:04.320
<v Speaker 2>to grow meat in a vat is ethically the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing as,</v>

1709
01:20:06.670 --> 01:20:11.670
<v Speaker 2>at least my view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be the same thing as producing a </v>

1710
01:20:11.670 --> 01:20:11.670
<v Speaker 2>brainless cow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1711
01:20:11.670 --> 01:20:13.230
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have the whole cow that you could</v>

1712
01:20:13.231 --> 01:20:15.070
<v Speaker 2>slaughter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it has no brain.</v>

1713
01:20:15.071 --> 01:20:20.071
<v Speaker 2>And so presumably there's no experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this animal,</v>

1714
01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:23.550
<v Speaker 2>but it is the fully functioning animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1715
01:20:23.551 --> 01:20:26.390
<v Speaker 2>So let's say you could produce that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be a,</v>

1716
01:20:26.430 --> 01:20:30.570
<v Speaker 2>you would produce healthy meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a messier.</v>

1717
01:20:31.530 --> 01:20:33.120
<v Speaker 2>Presumably you have to feed this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1718
01:20:33.210 --> 01:20:33.870
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

1719
01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:35.880
<v Speaker 2>or I don't know how you get it to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1720
01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:37.350
<v Speaker 2>you'll say you feed it intravenously.</v>

1721
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:40.290
<v Speaker 2>It all begins to look weirder and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Weirder,</v>

1722
01:20:40.830 --> 01:20:44.040
<v Speaker 2>but there is no suffering there because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no brain.</v>

1723
01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:46.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we would,</v>

1724
01:20:46.730 --> 01:20:51.730
<v Speaker 2>and I think we have decided to bypass </v>
<v Speaker 2>that vision and just go straight to the </v>

1725
01:20:51.730 --> 01:20:53.700
<v Speaker 2>VAT and just build it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sell,</v>

1726
01:20:53.701 --> 01:20:54.330
<v Speaker 2>buy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sell,</v>

1727
01:20:54.690 --> 01:20:58.890
<v Speaker 2>and build up only what we need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the meatball or the steak or a.</v>

1728
01:20:58.910 --> 01:21:03.910
<v Speaker 2>and so why have the author and the and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the organs that you don't want and the </v>

1729
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:05.940
<v Speaker 2>mess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm the kind of the energy intensive</v>

1730
01:21:05.941 --> 01:21:10.941
<v Speaker 2>aspects of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of producing whole animal and I think </v>

1731
01:21:10.941 --> 01:21:13.191
<v Speaker 2>with like spare parts for humans rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>than create a clone of yourself that has</v>

1732
01:21:13.321 --> 01:21:14.770
<v Speaker 2>no brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you just keep in a,</v>

1733
01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:18.520
<v Speaker 2>in a vat somewhere in your garage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1734
01:21:18.570 --> 01:21:20.550
<v Speaker 2>where you can get spare kidneys when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>need them.</v>

1735
01:21:20.910 --> 01:21:25.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would just be able to print the </v>

1736
01:21:25.910 --> 01:21:30.261
<v Speaker 2>kidneys and that is that because that </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets around a lot of the weirdness,</v>

1737
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:32.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be weird to have a copy of yourself</v>

1738
01:21:32.790 --> 01:21:35.810
<v Speaker 2>that's just a spare parts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1739
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.360
<v Speaker 2>whereas it wouldn't be weird or at least</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my view,</v>

1740
01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:43.380
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be fantastic to be able to go </v>

1741
01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:46.131
<v Speaker 2>into a hospital when your kidneys are </v>
<v Speaker 2>failing and they just take a cell and </v>

1742
01:21:46.131 --> 01:21:46.320
<v Speaker 2>print you a new kidney.</v>

1743
01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:48.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1744
01:21:48.590 --> 01:21:51.350
<v Speaker 3>I think that can be expected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's going to.</v>

1745
01:21:51.530 --> 01:21:52.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's possible,</v>

1746
01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:56.750
<v Speaker 3>it seems like it's going in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bladder example you just gave is,</v>

1747
01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:58.790
<v Speaker 3>is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's happening there.</v>

1748
01:21:58.850 --> 01:22:03.850
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I always want to extrapolate things </v>

1749
01:22:03.850 --> 01:22:06.170
<v Speaker 3>to some bizarre place a thousand years </v>
<v Speaker 3>from now for some reason because,</v>

1750
01:22:06.171 --> 01:22:06.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

1751
01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:07.970
<v Speaker 3>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1752
01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:11.690
<v Speaker 3>since I got into Dan Carlin's hardcore </v>
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>

1753
01:22:12.290 --> 01:22:12.970
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

1754
01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:18.060
<v Speaker 3>it really fucked my mind up about how I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think about the past in this way that I </v>

1755
01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:21.770
<v Speaker 3>look like a thousand years ago in </v>
<v Speaker 3>comparison to today.</v>

1756
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:23.000
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1757
01:22:23.010 --> 01:22:23.660
<v Speaker 3>I try to think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1758
01:22:23.661 --> 01:22:26.330
<v Speaker 3>how much different will people be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand years from now?</v>

1759
01:22:26.470 --> 01:22:28.690
<v Speaker 3>And it probably way more different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1760
01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:30.020
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>

1761
01:22:30.190 --> 01:22:33.320
<v Speaker 3>the fascination that we have with </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient histories that we,</v>

1762
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:35.780
<v Speaker 3>one of the things obviously we want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>know where we came from,</v>

1763
01:22:35.781 --> 01:22:40.781
<v Speaker 3>but also we can kind of see people today</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing similar shit if they were allowed </v>

1764
01:22:41.061 --> 01:22:43.400
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if everything went horribly wrong,</v>

1765
01:22:43.401 --> 01:22:48.401
<v Speaker 3>people at their base level of kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>similar today as they were a thousand </v>

1766
01:22:48.401 --> 01:22:53.110
<v Speaker 3>years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of them might be running for </v>

1767
01:22:53.110 --> 01:22:53.110
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can talk about that.</v>

1768
01:22:53.110 --> 01:22:57.790
<v Speaker 3>And when I think about the future a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand years from now with the way </v>

1769
01:22:58.731 --> 01:23:03.731
<v Speaker 3>technology is accelerating and the just </v>
<v Speaker 3>the capacity that we have an ability </v>

1770
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:06.400
<v Speaker 3>change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things</v>

1771
01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:11.700
<v Speaker 1>to change the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>change physical structures to change </v>

1772
01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:14.941
<v Speaker 1>bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to dig into the ground and extract </v>

1773
01:23:14.941 --> 01:23:18.630
<v Speaker 1>resources like we're getting better and </v>
<v Speaker 1>better at changing things and </v>

1774
01:23:18.630 --> 01:23:22.831
<v Speaker 1>manipulating things that extracting </v>
<v Speaker 1>power from the sun and extracting salt </v>

1775
01:23:22.831 --> 01:23:27.811
<v Speaker 1>from the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like all this bizarre change </v>

1776
01:23:27.811 --> 01:23:30.331
<v Speaker 1>technology that's consistently and </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly going on with people and it </v>

1777
01:23:30.331 --> 01:23:34.021
<v Speaker 1>continues to get better when I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a thousand years from now and </v>

1778
01:23:34.021 --> 01:23:37.261
<v Speaker 1>artificial people and light and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept of being able to read each </v>

1779
01:23:37.261 --> 01:23:40.771
<v Speaker 1>other's minds and being able to map out </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagery and pass it back and forth from </v>

1780
01:23:40.771 --> 01:23:44.090
<v Speaker 1>mind to mind and like a clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>spreadsheet form like a.</v>

1781
01:23:44.170 --> 01:23:45.670
<v Speaker 1>What does that movie with Tom Cruise </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

1782
01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.290
<v Speaker 1>Minority report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

1783
01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:53.020
<v Speaker 1>Mean that's the way it's on the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be incredibly strange to </v>

1784
01:23:53.020 --> 01:23:53.730
<v Speaker 1>be a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1785
01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:57.700
<v Speaker 1>Whether we will be people in a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

1786
01:23:57.701 --> 01:23:59.410
<v Speaker 1>I think you would.</v>

1787
01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:05.100
<v Speaker 1>Unless we have done something terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>and knocked ourselves back a thousand </v>

1788
01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:05.100
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1789
01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:09.610
<v Speaker 1>I think we will decide to change </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves in that time in ways that will</v>

1790
01:24:09.611 --> 01:24:11.240
<v Speaker 1>make us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>

1791
01:24:11.241 --> 01:24:11.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll be,</v>

1792
01:24:11.921 --> 01:24:14.920
<v Speaker 1>there may be many different species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like tattoos,</v>

1793
01:24:14.921 --> 01:24:15.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1794
01:24:15.341 --> 01:24:16.930
<v Speaker 1>you have a bunch of tattoos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have none.</v>

1795
01:24:16.931 --> 01:24:21.931
<v Speaker 1>You could take that a lot further if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can just begin really tinkering with </v>

1796
01:24:23.321 --> 01:24:24.190
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1797
01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to get nutty and put the </v>

1798
01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:29.460
<v Speaker 1>bolts in your head and shit or just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just give yourself a,</v>

1799
01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:33.230
<v Speaker 1>just fundamentally different genetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1800
01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:34.210
<v Speaker 1>abilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1801
01:24:34.211 --> 01:24:39.211
<v Speaker 1>I mean like if you could just go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could become a different species if </v>

1802
01:24:39.211 --> 01:24:39.211
<v Speaker 1>you took it far enough.</v>

1803
01:24:41.110 --> 01:24:43.720
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's what the aliens are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's why they all look the same.</v>

1804
01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:46.990
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they figured it out like a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to look alike.</v>

1805
01:24:47.170 --> 01:24:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you can't appreciate each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

1806
01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:53.380
<v Speaker 1>When one guy's weird looking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one guy short,</v>

1807
01:24:53.381 --> 01:24:58.381
<v Speaker 1>one guy's got a big nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody is so confusing to many </v>

1808
01:24:58.381 --> 01:25:01.141
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could hate everybody look exactly the </v>

1809
01:25:01.141 --> 01:25:01.141
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the government gets together with all</v>

1810
01:25:01.141 --> 01:25:05.521
<v Speaker 1>the people to their planet and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look where we have a problem with this </v>

1811
01:25:05.521 --> 01:25:05.521
<v Speaker 1>good looking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bullshits holding us back.</v>

1812
01:25:05.521 --> 01:25:07.120
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people that are stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that getting ahead,</v>

1813
01:25:07.330 --> 01:25:10.900
<v Speaker 1>we've got all look the same blank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionless and big giant eyes.</v>

1814
01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:14.620
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all just went in with a passion for</v>

1815
01:25:14.621 --> 01:25:16.630
<v Speaker 1>molesting cattle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allegedly.</v>

1816
01:25:16.631 --> 01:25:20.680
<v Speaker 1>I think that's people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are blaming that on the aliens.</v>

1817
01:25:21.150 --> 01:25:23.500
<v Speaker 1>I had this guy on my podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>David Deutsch.</v>

1818
01:25:23.501 --> 01:25:24.130
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard of him?</v>

1819
01:25:24.130 --> 01:25:25.780
<v Speaker 1>He was a physicist at Oxford.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1820
01:25:25.781 --> 01:25:26.950
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why ever heard of him?</v>

1821
01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:32.280
<v Speaker 1>He wrote a book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gave it at least one ted talk and </v>

1822
01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:35.110
<v Speaker 1>he's written two very good books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first came out about 10 years ago,</v>

1823
01:25:35.111 --> 01:25:39.880
<v Speaker 1>the fabric of reality and the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>recent one is the beginning of infinity.</v>

1824
01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:45.190
<v Speaker 1>And I'm extremely smart guy and I'm very</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice guy.</v>

1825
01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:47.020
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1826
01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:52.800
<v Speaker 1>he has this thesis which he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he and I don't totally agree about the </v>

1827
01:25:53.410 --> 01:25:56.380
<v Speaker 1>implications going forward for ai,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

1828
01:25:56.390 --> 01:26:00.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's convinced me that his basic thesis,</v>

1829
01:26:00.041 --> 01:26:01.420
<v Speaker 1>which is fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is his,</v>

1830
01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:02.940
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1831
01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 1>the role</v>

1832
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:09.040
<v Speaker 2>that knowledge plays in our universe or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the potential role that it plays and his</v>

1833
01:26:09.921 --> 01:26:14.030
<v Speaker 2>argument is that in any corner of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe,</v>

1834
01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:20.470
<v Speaker 2>anything that is compatible with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>laws of physics can be done with the </v>

1835
01:26:21.771 --> 01:26:24.090
<v Speaker 2>requisite knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that as,</v>

1836
01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:24.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

1837
01:26:24.410 --> 01:26:29.410
<v Speaker 2>his argument about how deep knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes and therefore how valuable it is in</v>

1838
01:26:29.601 --> 01:26:34.601
<v Speaker 2>the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm queuing off your notion of </v>

1839
01:26:34.601 --> 01:26:35.070
<v Speaker 2>building an artificial person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean literally,</v>

1840
01:26:35.071 --> 01:26:36.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sell by salary,</v>

1841
01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:40.550
<v Speaker 2>atom by atom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that.</v>

1842
01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:44.120
<v Speaker 2>There's every reason to believe that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>compatible with the laws of physics.</v>

1843
01:26:44.121 --> 01:26:44.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we exist,</v>

1844
01:26:44.961 --> 01:26:45.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>

1845
01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:49.100
<v Speaker 2>we got built by the happenstance of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of biology.</v>

1846
01:26:49.590 --> 01:26:53.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we had what he calls a,</v>

1847
01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:55.820
<v Speaker 2>a universal constructor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1848
01:26:55.821 --> 01:27:00.620
<v Speaker 2>the smallest machine that could assemble</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the other machine atom by atom,</v>

1849
01:27:01.090 --> 01:27:02.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could,</v>

1850
01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:04.070
<v Speaker 2>we could build anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adam.</v>

1851
01:27:04.071 --> 01:27:04.850
<v Speaker 2>Bye Adam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1852
01:27:05.210 --> 01:27:10.210
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he has this vision of it like you </v>

1853
01:27:10.210 --> 01:27:12.250
<v Speaker 2>could literally go into a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1854
01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:17.680
<v Speaker 2>an area of deep space that is as close </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a vacuum as possible and you know,</v>

1855
01:27:17.691 --> 01:27:22.691
<v Speaker 2>begins sweeping up stray hydrogen atoms </v>
<v Speaker 2>and fuse them together and generate </v>

1856
01:27:25.611 --> 01:27:26.840
<v Speaker 2>heavier elements.</v>

1857
01:27:27.140 --> 01:27:32.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you could start with nothing but </v>

1858
01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:32.140
<v Speaker 2>hydrogen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right and,</v>

1859
01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:36.130
<v Speaker 2>and bay with the requisite knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>few bit,</v>

1860
01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:39.080
<v Speaker 2>build your own little fusion reactor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>create heavier elements,</v>

1861
01:27:39.410 --> 01:27:44.410
<v Speaker 2>and based on those elements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>create the smallest machine that can </v>

1862
01:27:44.691 --> 01:27:47.360
<v Speaker 2>then assemble anything else atom by </v>
<v Speaker 2>atom,</v>

1863
01:27:47.790 --> 01:27:49.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including more of itself.</v>

1864
01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:54.460
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you could start this process of </v>

1865
01:27:54.460 --> 01:27:56.100
<v Speaker 2>building anything from a person to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1866
01:27:56.130 --> 01:27:59.390
<v Speaker 2>if there's something far more advanced </v>
<v Speaker 2>than a person to a planet,</v>

1867
01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:01.880
<v Speaker 2>but just anything is made of atoms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1868
01:28:01.881 --> 01:28:03.480
<v Speaker 2>Anything is organized and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1869
01:28:03.490 --> 01:28:06.920
<v Speaker 2>and so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the limiting factor in,</v>

1870
01:28:07.010 --> 01:28:10.010
<v Speaker 2>in that case is always the knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1871
01:28:10.011 --> 01:28:12.860
<v Speaker 2>So it's either the eliminating factors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either the laws of physics,</v>

1872
01:28:12.861 --> 01:28:17.861
<v Speaker 2>either this can't be done because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>physically impossible or the knowledge </v>

1873
01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:23.320
<v Speaker 2>is what you're lacking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm given that human beings are </v>

1874
01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:27.401
<v Speaker 2>physically impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There should be some knowledge path </v>

1875
01:28:27.401 --> 01:28:28.310
<v Speaker 2>whereby you could assemble one atom by </v>
<v Speaker 2>atom,</v>

1876
01:28:28.910 --> 01:28:29.150
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1877
01:28:29.150 --> 01:28:34.150
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason why there's no deep </v>

1878
01:28:34.150 --> 01:28:36.971
<v Speaker 2>physical reason why that wouldn't be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>case that the reason is it's we don't </v>

1879
01:28:36.971 --> 01:28:41.310
<v Speaker 2>know how to do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But presumably a,</v>

1880
01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:45.260
<v Speaker 2>it'd be possible for us to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to acquire that knowledge.</v>

1881
01:28:45.261 --> 01:28:49.190
<v Speaker 2>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the horizon of knowledge is just extends</v>

1882
01:28:50.690 --> 01:28:52.100
<v Speaker 2>functionally without limit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1883
01:28:52.101 --> 01:28:52.620
<v Speaker 2>There's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1884
01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:57.620
<v Speaker 2>we were nowhere near the place where we </v>
<v Speaker 2>know everything that's knowable,</v>

1885
01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:59.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

1886
01:28:59.450 --> 01:29:03.270
<v Speaker 2>as witnessed by the fact that we don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>yet know how to build a,</v>

1887
01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:06.280
<v Speaker 2>a human atom by atom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1888
01:29:06.990 --> 01:29:11.850
<v Speaker 2>but when you imagine just the changes </v>
<v Speaker 2>that could occur in our world,</v>

1889
01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:14.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>w w with,</v>

1890
01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:16.380
<v Speaker 2>with the frontiers of knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 2>explored,</v>

1891
01:29:16.590 --> 01:29:18.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10,000</v>

1892
01:29:18.361 --> 01:29:20.450
<v Speaker 2>years beyond where we are now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1893
01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:25.460
<v Speaker 2>it would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will be unrecognizable to ourselves </v>

1894
01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:26.760
<v Speaker 2>and everything would be equivalent to </v>
<v Speaker 2>magic.</v>

1895
01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:27.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we could see it now.</v>

1896
01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:32.960
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and most of human history is not like </v>

1897
01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:35.571
<v Speaker 2>that in most of human history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you dropped into any period of </v>

1898
01:29:35.571 --> 01:29:35.700
<v Speaker 2>human history?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

1899
01:29:36.570 --> 01:29:41.570
<v Speaker 2>for all intents and purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>identical to the way it was 500 years </v>

1900
01:29:41.570 --> 01:29:45.681
<v Speaker 2>before and 500 years before that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only very recently where you would </v>

1901
01:29:45.681 --> 01:29:49.941
<v Speaker 2>drop in and be surprised by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology and by the culture and by </v>

1902
01:29:50.810 --> 01:29:52.100
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1903
01:29:52.101 --> 01:29:55.140
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is being done with language and the</v>

1904
01:29:55.141 --> 01:30:00.141
<v Speaker 2>consequences of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a cooperation among apes like </v>

1905
01:30:00.141 --> 01:30:01.210
<v Speaker 2>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1906
01:30:01.470 --> 01:30:06.470
<v Speaker 2>so I think that this is one place where </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone like Kurtzweil makes a lot of </v>

1907
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:06.870
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

1908
01:30:06.930 --> 01:30:08.850
<v Speaker 2>this is clearly accelerating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1909
01:30:08.851 --> 01:30:13.851
<v Speaker 2>And if we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if we don't do something </v>

1910
01:30:13.851 --> 01:30:13.851
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1911
01:30:13.851 --> 01:30:16.980
<v Speaker 2>to set us back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this acceleration is,</v>

1912
01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:22.760
<v Speaker 2>is the implication is that the future is</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be far less recognizable than </v>

1913
01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:30.020
<v Speaker 2>it has been in an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in any other period of human history to </v>

1914
01:30:30.020 --> 01:30:34.610
<v Speaker 2>the idea of creating a little machine </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you could shoot out into the </v>

1915
01:30:34.610 --> 01:30:34.950
<v Speaker 2>universe and we'll build you a planet.</v>

1916
01:30:35.850 --> 01:30:36.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1917
01:30:36.750 --> 01:30:41.750
<v Speaker 2>But the planet is a planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the planets obviously big and </v>

1918
01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:44.490
<v Speaker 2>the basis for our biosphere and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything we care about.</v>

1919
01:30:44.491 --> 01:30:49.491
<v Speaker 2>But the planet is not what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated.</v>

1920
01:30:50.010 --> 01:30:53.820
<v Speaker 2>It's the ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the life on the planet.</v>

1921
01:30:53.821 --> 01:30:56.700
<v Speaker 2>And our own brains being the ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>example of,</v>

1922
01:30:56.730 --> 01:30:58.020
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that complexity,</v>

1923
01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:04.520
<v Speaker 2>but presumably intelligent systems can </v>
<v Speaker 2>become much more complex than that,</v>

1924
01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:10.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason to think that we are </v>

1925
01:31:10.940 --> 01:31:10.940
<v Speaker 2>near the summit of possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence,</v>

1926
01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:16.040
<v Speaker 2>a biological or otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm a,</v>

1927
01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:17.790
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1928
01:31:17.810 --> 01:31:19.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you,</v>

1929
01:31:19.411 --> 01:31:23.490
<v Speaker 2>once you begin thinking about building </v>
<v Speaker 2>things atom by atom,</v>

1930
01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:26.030
<v Speaker 2>then then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the,</v>

1931
01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:29.650
<v Speaker 2>the future begins to look very weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's,</v>

1932
01:31:29.980 --> 01:31:32.100
<v Speaker 2>and automating that process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1933
01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:34.320
<v Speaker 2>Where you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>

1934
01:31:34.350 --> 01:31:37.350
<v Speaker 2>this is the promise of nanotechnology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1935
01:31:37.890 --> 01:31:40.920
<v Speaker 2>where you have something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you tiny machines that can,</v>

1936
01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:46.640
<v Speaker 2>can both build more of themselves and </v>
<v Speaker 2>more of anything else that would be made</v>

1937
01:31:47.261 --> 01:31:52.261
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of tiny machines or assemble anything </v>

1938
01:31:52.261 --> 01:31:55.461
<v Speaker 2>atom by atom or treat your own body like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a machine that it is and deal with it </v>

1939
01:31:55.461 --> 01:31:56.040
<v Speaker 2>atom by atom.</v>

1940
01:31:56.370 --> 01:31:58.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the possibilities of intervention</v>

1941
01:31:58.741 --> 01:32:02.410
<v Speaker 2>in the human body or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or then virtually limitless.</v>

1942
01:32:02.910 --> 01:32:05.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's a uh,</v>

1943
01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:08.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1944
01:32:08.531 --> 01:32:08.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1945
01:32:09.010 --> 01:32:14.010
<v Speaker 2>that's where we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where the physical world begins </v>

1946
01:32:14.010 --> 01:32:15.430
<v Speaker 2>to look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just totally fungible.</v>

1947
01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:20.460
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know when you're not talking about </v>

1948
01:32:20.460 --> 01:32:22.650
<v Speaker 2>surgery where you're cutting into </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's head and hoping you know in </v>

1949
01:32:22.650 --> 01:32:26.521
<v Speaker 2>very coarse way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hoping you're not taking out areas of </v>

1950
01:32:26.521 --> 01:32:29.401
<v Speaker 2>brain that they need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're talking about actually </v>

1951
01:32:29.401 --> 01:32:30.910
<v Speaker 2>repairing A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you're talking,</v>

1952
01:32:30.911 --> 01:32:35.911
<v Speaker 2>if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can tinker with Adam's in a way </v>

1953
01:32:35.911 --> 01:32:38.101
<v Speaker 2>that you understand you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're talking about repairing </v>

1954
01:32:38.101 --> 01:32:38.101
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1955
01:32:38.101 --> 01:32:39.150
<v Speaker 2>Then in creating anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1956
01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:43.420
<v Speaker 2>like literally Dr Manhattan style,</v>
<v Speaker 2>build ice condos on Mars.</v>

1957
01:32:43.780 --> 01:32:46.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean you could create art with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could do anything with it.</v>

1958
01:32:47.470 --> 01:32:52.470
<v Speaker 2>It would just somehow or another have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be programmed with whatever pattern you </v>

1959
01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:52.470
<v Speaker 2>were trying to create.</v>

1960
01:32:52.470 --> 01:32:55.960
<v Speaker 2>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could essentially like make an earth</v>

1961
01:32:56.530 --> 01:32:59.800
<v Speaker 2>somewhere else with all the biological </v>
<v Speaker 2>diversity,</v>

1962
01:32:59.801 --> 01:33:04.801
<v Speaker 2>water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even intelligent life that all could be </v>

1963
01:33:04.801 --> 01:33:05.110
<v Speaker 2>done through some sort of a machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it is only one day.</v>

1964
01:33:05.140 --> 01:33:07.210
<v Speaker 2>It is at bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1965
01:33:07.211 --> 01:33:12.211
<v Speaker 2>just the information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the knowledge of how to organize </v>

1966
01:33:12.211 --> 01:33:17.040
<v Speaker 2>and how to implement it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like it's analogous to what has </v>

1967
01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:21.301
<v Speaker 2>happened in films now where like an </v>
<v Speaker 2>animation and film has gotten good </v>

1968
01:33:22.300 --> 01:33:23.020
<v Speaker 2>suddenly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1969
01:33:23.021 --> 01:33:24.910
<v Speaker 2>Where you can see like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if they can animate,</v>

1970
01:33:25.130 --> 01:33:30.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>waving hair and full and flowing water </v>

1971
01:33:30.130 --> 01:33:32.680
<v Speaker 2>and it looks pretty damn good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looked terrible 30 years ago.</v>

1972
01:33:32.681 --> 01:33:35.290
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we just acclimated to look terrible,</v>

1973
01:33:35.291 --> 01:33:39.690
<v Speaker 2>but I'm now at you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can really trick the eye.</v>

1974
01:33:39.691 --> 01:33:44.691
<v Speaker 2>You can build up scenes of nature where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not actually using any </v>

1975
01:33:46.180 --> 01:33:48.670
<v Speaker 2>photography of nature to build it up.</v>

1976
01:33:48.670 --> 01:33:51.250
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all a confection of,</v>

1977
01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:53.050
<v Speaker 2>of ones and zeroes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1978
01:33:53.051 --> 01:33:53.770
<v Speaker 2>They've just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've just,</v>

1979
01:33:54.250 --> 01:33:56.740
<v Speaker 2>they've just built it in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in software like the revenant.</v>

1980
01:33:57.250 --> 01:33:59.200
<v Speaker 2>Perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that giant bear,</v>

1981
01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:01.240
<v Speaker 2>the attack Leonardo Dicaprio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

1982
01:34:01.260 --> 01:34:03.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how that was done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

1983
01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:03.880
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1984
01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:06.760
<v Speaker 2>I had heard that that was all just pure </v>
<v Speaker 2>CGI.</v>

1985
01:34:06.761 --> 01:34:11.761
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then when there was a dude in a costume </v>

1986
01:34:11.761 --> 01:34:11.761
<v Speaker 2>that acted it out with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1987
01:34:11.761 --> 01:34:11.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially it was just all CGI.</v>

1988
01:34:11.890 --> 01:34:13.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1989
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:14.290
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

1990
01:34:14.291 --> 01:34:17.380
<v Speaker 2>so that the fact that that's beginning </v>
<v Speaker 2>to look good,</v>

1991
01:34:17.410 --> 01:34:18.100
<v Speaker 2>that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1992
01:34:18.101 --> 01:34:19.990
<v Speaker 2>obviously that's just all surface that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't,</v>

1993
01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:23.300
<v Speaker 2>has no implication for the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1994
01:34:23.330 --> 01:34:28.330
<v Speaker 2>building a rendering of a bear on film </v>
<v Speaker 2>is not the same thing as building a </v>

1995
01:34:28.330 --> 01:34:32.671
<v Speaker 2>bear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that we can move so far </v>

1996
01:34:32.671 --> 01:34:36.271
<v Speaker 2>into a building,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm modeling that kind of complexity </v>

1997
01:34:37.451 --> 01:34:41.600
<v Speaker 2>visually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just imagine what a superintelligent,</v>

1998
01:34:42.140 --> 01:34:47.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind could do with a thousand years to,</v>

1999
01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:48.310
<v Speaker 2>to work at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2000
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:51.250
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's we're on the cusp of.</v>

2001
01:34:51.670 --> 01:34:52.850
<v Speaker 2>And when I say cuss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2002
01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:57.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean five years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's say a century we're on the </v>

2003
01:34:57.870 --> 01:34:58.130
<v Speaker 2>cusp of a producing the kind</v>

2004
01:34:58.130 --> 01:35:03.130
<v Speaker 1>of technology that will allow for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we put it into perspective </v>

2005
01:35:03.130 --> 01:35:06.460
<v Speaker 1>photography,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe was even invented until </v>

2006
01:35:06.460 --> 01:35:09.551
<v Speaker 1>the early 18 hundreds when it was first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says sounds about photographs of </v>

2007
01:35:10.131 --> 01:35:11.090
<v Speaker 1>Lincoln.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are though.</v>

2008
01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:16.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So was that the early 18 hundreds when </v>

2009
01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:18.551
<v Speaker 1>he was killed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 18,</v>

2010
01:35:18.651 --> 01:35:19.620
<v Speaker 1>sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

2011
01:35:19.650 --> 01:35:20.390
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>65.</v>

2012
01:35:20.420 --> 01:35:24.130
<v Speaker 1>So somewhere after that or somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>before the other,</v>

2013
01:35:24.230 --> 01:35:29.230
<v Speaker 1>they invented photography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So essentially give or take 10 years,</v>

2014
01:35:31.490 --> 01:35:34.130
<v Speaker 1>200 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really amazing.</v>

2015
01:35:34.150 --> 01:35:39.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you stop thinking about the revenue </v>

2016
01:35:39.150 --> 01:35:41.020
<v Speaker 1>from 200 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we couldn't figure out how to get sound </v>

2017
01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:43.721
<v Speaker 1>in our movies until that 100 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That thought right there just actually </v>

2018
01:35:44.241 --> 01:35:47.210
<v Speaker 1>just freaked me out with a 200 year </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>

2019
01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:52.420
<v Speaker 1>Like how little 200 years is the hmong </v>
<v Speaker 1>gold days and now 200 years ago they </v>

2020
01:35:52.420 --> 01:35:56.981
<v Speaker 1>didn't even have cameras and now they do</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now they have this insane ability to</v>

2021
01:35:58.221 --> 01:36:03.221
<v Speaker 1>recreate things like game of thrones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wolves and dragons and she's riding </v>

2022
01:36:03.221 --> 01:36:03.380
<v Speaker 1>around on dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2023
01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:08.800
<v Speaker 1>it looks like she's on a dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look like old school King </v>

2024
01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:08.800
<v Speaker 1>Kong movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2025
01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:12.800
<v Speaker 1>you ever tried to watch those videos in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are some pleasure in that.</v>

2026
01:36:13.341 --> 01:36:18.341
<v Speaker 1>There are awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're awesome too to to just get into </v>

2027
01:36:18.341 --> 01:36:18.920
<v Speaker 1>for fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as far as like visual effects,</v>

2028
01:36:18.921 --> 01:36:23.921
<v Speaker 1>what they can do now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that it's all been done </v>

2029
01:36:23.921 --> 01:36:26.030
<v Speaker 1>over 200 years is just spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not just capturing the image,</v>

2030
01:36:26.031 --> 01:36:29.330
<v Speaker 1>but then recreating an artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>version and projecting it,</v>

2031
01:36:29.540 --> 01:36:30.320
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2032
01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:33.110
<v Speaker 1>a thousand times more difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's</v>

2033
01:36:33.510 --> 01:36:38.510
<v Speaker 2>the other feature here of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>compounding power of knowledge and </v>

2034
01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:43.680
<v Speaker 2>technology were you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are certain gains that are truly </v>

2035
01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:46.620
<v Speaker 2>incremental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas just everything is hard.</v>

2036
01:36:46.621 --> 01:36:51.621
<v Speaker 2>Won.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is just one percent better </v>

2037
01:36:51.621 --> 01:36:53.430
<v Speaker 2>than its predecessor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then there are other gains that,</v>

2038
01:36:53.490 --> 01:36:58.490
<v Speaker 2>where it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have created an ability that takes </v>

2039
01:36:58.490 --> 01:37:02.601
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like a kind of quantum leap </v>

2040
01:37:02.601 --> 01:37:06.380
<v Speaker 2>beyond where you were and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you go from just fundamentally not</v>

2041
01:37:06.631 --> 01:37:09.870
<v Speaker 2>being able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do anything in that domain.</v>

2042
01:37:09.871 --> 01:37:11.990
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden the domain </v>
<v Speaker 2>opens up totally.</v>

2043
01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.370
<v Speaker 2>So know flight is an example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2044
01:37:14.371 --> 01:37:19.371
<v Speaker 2>So for the longest time people couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>fly and it was obvious that you can't </v>

2045
01:37:20.161 --> 01:37:22.620
<v Speaker 2>fly or you're heavier than air and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not,</v>

2046
01:37:22.621 --> 01:37:27.621
<v Speaker 2>you don't have feathers and you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way to flap your arms fast </v>

2047
01:37:27.621 --> 01:37:29.640
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're never going to fly.</v>

2048
01:37:29.641 --> 01:37:34.641
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then at a certain point flight as </v>

2049
01:37:34.641 --> 01:37:36.180
<v Speaker 2>possible and opens this whole domain of </v>
<v Speaker 2>innovation.</v>

2050
01:37:36.590 --> 01:37:41.590
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the difference between not being </v>

2051
01:37:41.590 --> 01:37:41.590
<v Speaker 2>able to flow in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

2052
01:37:41.590 --> 01:37:42.630
<v Speaker 2>there's no progress you can make on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground that it doesn't,</v>

2053
01:37:42.810 --> 01:37:44.120
<v Speaker 2>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2054
01:37:44.820 --> 01:37:46.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>avail itself of the,</v>

2055
01:37:46.700 --> 01:37:51.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the principles of flight as we now know </v>

2056
01:37:51.700 --> 01:37:52.290
<v Speaker 2>them that's going to get you closer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2057
01:37:52.291 --> 01:37:54.420
<v Speaker 2>you can't jump a little bit higher and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just not.</v>

2058
01:37:54.750 --> 01:37:59.750
<v Speaker 2>And so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter what you do with your </v>

2059
01:37:59.750 --> 01:37:59.750
<v Speaker 2>shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2060
01:37:59.750 --> 01:38:01.490
<v Speaker 2>so there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>

2061
01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:05.870
<v Speaker 2>there are kind of fundamental gains that</v>
<v Speaker 2>opened up a whole dna sequencing is,</v>

2062
01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:10.940
<v Speaker 2>is a more recent example where </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding and having access to the </v>

2063
01:38:10.940 --> 01:38:14.240
<v Speaker 2>genome and that's you go from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2064
01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:19.640
<v Speaker 2>the only way to influence the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your descendants is to basically make a </v>

2065
01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:27.100
<v Speaker 2>good choice in wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2066
01:38:27.150 --> 01:38:32.150
<v Speaker 2>or husband to you can just create a new </v>
<v Speaker 2>species in a test tube if you wanted to </v>

2067
01:38:34.470 --> 01:38:35.790
<v Speaker 2>write and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a,</v>

2068
01:38:35.791 --> 01:38:39.480
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of a compounding power of,</v>

2069
01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:40.210
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2070
01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:42.780
<v Speaker 2>understanding the way things work.</v>

2071
01:38:42.910 --> 01:38:43.250
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2072
01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:44.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's,</v>

2073
01:38:44.131 --> 01:38:49.131
<v Speaker 2>I think we're at the beginning of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>process that could look very,</v>

2074
01:38:49.201 --> 01:38:50.700
<v Speaker 2>very strange very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very quickly.</v>

2075
01:38:50.910 --> 01:38:51.600
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2076
01:38:51.690 --> 01:38:52.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2077
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:54.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2078
01:38:55.050 --> 01:38:56.790
<v Speaker 2>obviously we were both in good and bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways,</v>

2079
01:38:56.791 --> 01:38:57.570
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2080
01:38:58.380 --> 01:39:03.380
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's any brake to pull </v>

2081
01:39:03.380 --> 01:39:03.380
<v Speaker 2>on this train.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I even,</v>

2082
01:39:03.380 --> 01:39:07.790
<v Speaker 2>knowledge and intelligence are the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>valuable things we have,</v>

2083
01:39:08.071 --> 01:39:08.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to,</v>

2084
01:39:08.730 --> 01:39:13.140
<v Speaker 2>we're going to grab more in so far as we</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly can,</v>

2085
01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:18.620
<v Speaker 2>as quickly as we can and the moments of </v>
<v Speaker 2>us deciding not to know things and not </v>

2086
01:39:19.291 --> 01:39:21.120
<v Speaker 2>to learn how to do things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2087
01:39:21.121 --> 01:39:25.350
<v Speaker 2>those are so few and far between as to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be almost impossible to reference,</v>

2088
01:39:25.351 --> 01:39:30.351
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that there are moments where </v>

2089
01:39:30.351 --> 01:39:31.940
<v Speaker 2>people try to pull the brakes and say </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the whole conference and I say,</v>

2090
01:39:31.950 --> 01:39:33.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should we be doing any of this,</v>

2091
01:39:33.421 --> 01:39:34.020
<v Speaker 2>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2092
01:39:34.021 --> 01:39:36.390
<v Speaker 2>China does it or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or threatens to do it.</v>

2093
01:39:36.391 --> 01:39:39.960
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we wind up finding some way to do it,</v>

2094
01:39:40.210 --> 01:39:42.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2095
01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:44.910
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we consider ethical.</v>

2096
01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.650
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there are things like,</v>

2097
01:39:46.651 --> 01:39:49.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>germline tinkering that we,</v>

2098
01:39:49.770 --> 01:39:53.160
<v Speaker 2>as far as I know don't do and have </v>
<v Speaker 2>decided for good reason.</v>

2099
01:39:53.610 --> 01:39:55.990
<v Speaker 2>We're not doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

2100
01:39:58.020 --> 01:40:00.360
<v Speaker 2>is that going to stop people from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from doing this?</v>

2101
01:40:00.361 --> 01:40:02.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's any way</v>

2102
01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:06.420
<v Speaker 1>they're more worried about actual real </v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases than they are.</v>

2103
01:40:06.421 --> 01:40:11.421
<v Speaker 1>Man Made Diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we went to the CD CCS at disease </v>

2104
01:40:11.421 --> 01:40:11.610
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>CDC,</v>

2105
01:40:11.611 --> 01:40:14.610
<v Speaker 1>CDC in Galveston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's what it is.</v>

2106
01:40:14.780 --> 01:40:19.780
<v Speaker 1>It gets the name of the organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a building where they housed </v>

2107
01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:22.830
<v Speaker 1>some of the most horrendous viruses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases known demand.</v>

2108
01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Like they had anthrax in the CDC has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a lot of that.</v>

2109
01:40:26.881 --> 01:40:27.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2110
01:40:27.410 --> 01:40:32.410
<v Speaker 1>And they have these crazy walls like </v>
<v Speaker 1>thick thick walls and vacuums in the </v>

2111
01:40:32.410 --> 01:40:36.351
<v Speaker 1>ceilings and everyone's wearing suits </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they wanted us get in the suits and </v>

2112
01:40:36.351 --> 01:40:36.351
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

2113
01:40:37.530 --> 01:40:41.430
<v Speaker 1>There's no way I'm going in that room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did this for one of your shows for a</v>

2114
01:40:41.431 --> 01:40:45.060
<v Speaker 1>TV show with Duncan Trussell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the questions,</v>

2115
01:40:45.061 --> 01:40:49.080
<v Speaker 1>everything show because we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about weaponized diseases.</v>

2116
01:40:49.260 --> 01:40:51.630
<v Speaker 1>And the CDC was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget all that.</v>

2117
01:40:52.050 --> 01:40:55.270
<v Speaker 1>Like the real diseases that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly morphing.</v>

2118
01:40:55.270 --> 01:41:00.270
<v Speaker 1>We have to stay on top of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we should be terrified of </v>

2119
01:41:00.270 --> 01:41:03.180
<v Speaker 1>actual real diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like no one's shown any ability to </v>

2120
01:41:03.180 --> 01:41:04.840
<v Speaker 1>create this stuff that's more fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 1>than what we already have,</v>

2121
01:41:05.350 --> 01:41:08.470
<v Speaker 1>but weaponized anthrax and things along </v>
<v Speaker 1>those lines.</v>

2122
01:41:08.471 --> 01:41:13.471
<v Speaker 1>Like these Russian guys we talked to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were talking about how they had </v>

2123
01:41:13.471 --> 01:41:17.221
<v Speaker 1>vats of this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had all kinds of crazy diseases </v>

2124
01:41:17.221 --> 01:41:21.870
<v Speaker 1>that they had created just in case we </v>
<v Speaker 1>had gotten into some insane mutually </v>

2125
01:41:22.271 --> 01:41:24.220
<v Speaker 1>assured destruction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2126
01:41:24.260 --> 01:41:27.910
<v Speaker 1>a disease spreading thing like they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>down for that.</v>

2127
01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:28.540
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2128
01:41:28.541 --> 01:41:31.030
<v Speaker 1>we have to be prepared in case to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>

2129
01:41:31.031 --> 01:41:32.800
<v Speaker 1>Does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

2130
01:41:33.070 --> 01:41:38.070
<v Speaker 1>but what their concern is the center for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disease Control's guys that they were </v>

2131
01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:38.710
<v Speaker 1>concerned with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things like Ebola,</v>

2132
01:41:38.830 --> 01:41:41.170
<v Speaker 1>things morphing things becoming </v>
<v Speaker 1>airborne,</v>

2133
01:41:41.171 --> 01:41:46.171
<v Speaker 1>natural things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new strains of the flu that become </v>

2134
01:41:46.171 --> 01:41:46.780
<v Speaker 1>impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Murcia mercy as a terrifying one.</v>

2135
01:41:47.110 --> 01:41:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Mercy is one that has a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>scared.</v>

2136
01:41:49.511 --> 01:41:50.650
<v Speaker 1>A lot of doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scared.</v>

2137
01:41:51.110 --> 01:41:52.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a medication resistant.</v>

2138
01:41:52.781 --> 01:41:55.870
<v Speaker 1>Staph infection that's kills people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2139
01:41:55.871 --> 01:42:00.871
<v Speaker 1>it can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can absolutely kill people if you </v>

2140
01:42:00.871 --> 01:42:02.620
<v Speaker 1>don't jump on it quick and take the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>potent antibiotics we have and even then</v>

2141
01:42:02.621 --> 01:42:03.610
<v Speaker 1>it takes a long time.</v>

2142
01:42:03.790 --> 01:42:04.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2143
01:42:04.781 --> 01:42:06.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

2144
01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:08.680
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually just tweeted this recently,</v>

2145
01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:11.920
<v Speaker 2>I think I said well with some </v>
<v Speaker 2>billionaire with some,</v>

2146
01:42:12.340 --> 01:42:17.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero point one percent or develop some </v>

2147
01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:20.281
<v Speaker 2>new antibiotics because clearly the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government and the market can't figure </v>

2148
01:42:20.281 --> 01:42:23.581
<v Speaker 2>out how to do it and it really is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's falling through the cracks in the </v>

2149
01:42:23.581 --> 01:42:27.190
<v Speaker 2>government market paradigm where it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like either the government will do it or</v>

2150
01:42:27.191 --> 01:42:32.191
<v Speaker 2>the market will do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but neither are doing it because the </v>

2151
01:42:32.191 --> 01:42:35.041
<v Speaker 2>market can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill can't generate the rationale for </v>

2152
01:42:35.041 --> 01:42:39.871
<v Speaker 2>developing antibiotics because it's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>costly and you take them,</v>

2153
01:42:39.881 --> 01:42:41.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you take with any luck,</v>

2154
01:42:41.471 --> 01:42:42.160
<v Speaker 2>you take them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2155
01:42:42.161 --> 01:42:44.770
<v Speaker 2>once every 10 years for 10 days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's it.</v>

2156
01:42:44.771 --> 01:42:45.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

2157
01:42:45.181 --> 01:42:50.181
<v Speaker 2>it's not like Viagra or any of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>antidepressant or any drug that you're </v>

2158
01:42:50.181 --> 01:42:53.530
<v Speaker 2>going to take regularly for the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>

2159
01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:58.560
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's no real market incentive to </v>

2160
01:42:58.560 --> 01:42:59.590
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2161
01:42:59.591 --> 01:43:04.591
<v Speaker 2>or at least not enough of one to spend a</v>
<v Speaker 2>billion dollars developing an </v>

2162
01:43:04.591 --> 01:43:07.351
<v Speaker 2>antibiotic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the government apparently is not </v>

2163
01:43:07.351 --> 01:43:07.870
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're running out of antibiotics.</v>

2164
01:43:07.871 --> 01:43:09.910
<v Speaker 2>And this has been in the news a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently,</v>

2165
01:43:10.170 --> 01:43:15.170
<v Speaker 2>but we're close to being in a world </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's as though we don't have </v>

2166
01:43:15.431 --> 01:43:16.670
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

2167
01:43:16.710 --> 01:43:18.460
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're a superbug away from,</v>

2168
01:43:19.180 --> 01:43:21.510
<v Speaker 2>from being in that world and</v>

2169
01:43:21.890 --> 01:43:23.370
<v Speaker 1>freaking me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris.</v>

2170
01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:24.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get freaked out.</v>

2171
01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:29.060
<v Speaker 1>So it's super bugs are the big concern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2172
01:43:29.130 --> 01:43:33.550
<v Speaker 1>Do you think about that in Jujitsu?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I've gotten staff right?</v>

2173
01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:39.050
<v Speaker 1>My friend Ari had it and we were playing</v>
<v Speaker 1>pool and he was limping and I go,</v>

2174
01:43:39.051 --> 01:43:40.040
<v Speaker 1>what's going on with your leg?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man?</v>

2175
01:43:40.340 --> 01:43:41.390
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a spider bite.</v>

2176
01:43:41.570 --> 01:43:42.260
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me say.</v>

2177
01:43:42.510 --> 01:43:44.510
<v Speaker 1>It pulls up his pants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got staff,</v>

2178
01:43:44.810 --> 01:43:49.810
<v Speaker 1>you've got to get a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he hasn't even done Jujitsu and </v>

2179
01:43:49.810 --> 01:43:53.710
<v Speaker 1>years and I think he got staff again and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's one of those things where </v>

2180
01:43:53.710 --> 01:43:58.301
<v Speaker 1>once I guess everyone has it on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>body and when you get an infection then </v>

2181
01:43:58.301 --> 01:44:02.570
<v Speaker 1>it spreads and grows and apparently it </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be a reoccurring thing.</v>

2182
01:44:02.930 --> 01:44:07.930
<v Speaker 1>So people who get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly Murcia apparently they can </v>

2183
01:44:07.930 --> 01:44:09.410
<v Speaker 1>get it again and it can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can get pretty bad.</v>

2184
01:44:09.550 --> 01:44:12.800
<v Speaker 1>There was that one fighter who just </v>
<v Speaker 1>died,</v>

2185
01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:16.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't think related to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he had these.</v>

2186
01:44:16.730 --> 01:44:17.940
<v Speaker 1>Kevin randleman random.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2187
01:44:17.950 --> 01:44:18.490
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2188
01:44:18.660 --> 01:44:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Had the men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was that.</v>

2189
01:44:20.310 --> 01:44:21.110
<v Speaker 1>That was mercer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2190
01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:22.490
<v Speaker 1>A 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2191
01:44:22.670 --> 01:44:24.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was in the hospital.</v>

2192
01:44:24.021 --> 01:44:26.350
<v Speaker 1>What was it was staff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was mercy,</v>

2193
01:44:26.351 --> 01:44:29.390
<v Speaker 1>it could have been just staff that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignored for long periods of time,</v>

2194
01:44:29.391 --> 01:44:33.350
<v Speaker 1>but it was 100 percent staff and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>died.</v>

2195
01:44:33.710 --> 01:44:36.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what exactly was the cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>of his death,</v>

2196
01:44:37.130 --> 01:44:39.290
<v Speaker 1>but I can't think that that helped him </v>
<v Speaker 1>any.</v>

2197
01:44:39.710 --> 01:44:43.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean he had gotten so bad that it had </v>
<v Speaker 1>eaten through his body.</v>

2198
01:44:43.701 --> 01:44:48.701
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're interested in us for people </v>

2199
01:44:48.701 --> 01:44:48.701
<v Speaker 1>online that are listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google,</v>

2200
01:44:48.701 --> 01:44:53.681
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Randleman staph infection and </v>
<v Speaker 1>these are horrific photos that look </v>

2201
01:44:53.751 --> 01:44:55.940
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like something took a bite out of him,</v>

2202
01:44:56.300 --> 01:44:57.830
<v Speaker 1>like his under his arm pit.</v>

2203
01:44:57.860 --> 01:45:02.860
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm like a fist sized chunk of </v>

2204
01:45:02.860 --> 01:45:03.260
<v Speaker 1>meat was missing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2205
01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

2206
01:45:04.671 --> 01:45:06.280
<v Speaker 1>really scary stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2207
01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:07.400
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>skin infection.</v>

2208
01:45:07.401 --> 01:45:12.401
<v Speaker 1>There it is right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could take a good look deep in see </v>

2209
01:45:12.401 --> 01:45:13.220
<v Speaker 1>his muscle tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is hardcore,</v>

2210
01:45:13.250 --> 01:45:18.250
<v Speaker 1>no exaggeration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so was like a baseball sized hole and </v>

2211
01:45:18.250 --> 01:45:22.181
<v Speaker 1>he's got two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got another one lower down on his </v>

2212
01:45:22.181 --> 01:45:24.311
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is eating its way through his </v>

2213
01:45:24.311 --> 01:45:24.311
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that was,</v>

2214
01:45:24.311 --> 01:45:24.311
<v Speaker 1>that was a year before he died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2215
01:45:24.311 --> 01:45:24.970
<v Speaker 1>Or say some years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2216
01:45:24.980 --> 01:45:26.950
<v Speaker 1>it was years before he died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2217
01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:29.900
<v Speaker 1>but who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how devastating that might've been.</v>

2218
01:45:29.901 --> 01:45:34.901
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really bad infection and I think that </v>

2219
01:45:34.901 --> 01:45:37.880
<v Speaker 1>once your body's that compromise to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like really close to.</v>

2220
01:45:37.930 --> 01:45:40.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a really tough,</v>

2221
01:45:40.671 --> 01:45:42.260
<v Speaker 1>strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy guy.</v>

2222
01:45:42.530 --> 01:45:47.530
<v Speaker 1>He was a super athlete so I'm assuming </v>
<v Speaker 1>his body probably fought it off pretty </v>

2223
01:45:47.530 --> 01:45:52.451
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's probably one of the reasons why </v>

2224
01:45:52.451 --> 01:45:52.451
<v Speaker 1>you let it go so long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably didn't,</v>

2225
01:45:52.451 --> 01:45:55.340
<v Speaker 1>maybe didn't even understand how </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous it was or who knows.</v>

2226
01:45:55.341 --> 01:45:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it just jumped on him really </v>
<v Speaker 1>quick.</v>

2227
01:45:57.450 --> 01:46:00.870
<v Speaker 4>My Dad's girlfriend just got it on her </v>
<v Speaker 4>face and she was in the hospital for two</v>

2228
01:46:00.871 --> 01:46:05.871
<v Speaker 4>weeks and they were afraid it was going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to spread to her brain and it almost </v>

2229
01:46:05.871 --> 01:46:08.541
<v Speaker 4>did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she's not 100 percent out of the </v>

2230
01:46:08.541 --> 01:46:08.541
<v Speaker 4>woods yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she's back home now.</v>

2231
01:46:08.541 --> 01:46:13.200
<v Speaker 4>It's just got a little scratch on her </v>
<v Speaker 4>face and it spread into her cheek and </v>

2232
01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:17.391
<v Speaker 4>then into heard from her cheek.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She got a little red swelling and then </v>

2233
01:46:17.391 --> 01:46:17.570
<v Speaker 4>she couldn't see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then she had to go in the hospital.</v>

2234
01:46:17.660 --> 01:46:21.600
<v Speaker 4>You got staff chill out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Heavy antibiotics right away.</v>

2235
01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:23.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

2236
01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:28.590
<v Speaker 2>This is one area that this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this worries me.</v>

2237
01:46:28.610 --> 01:46:29.510
<v Speaker 2>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're,</v>

2238
01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:34.520
<v Speaker 2>they're the bad things we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And obviously there's a lot to be </v>

2239
01:46:34.621 --> 01:46:35.520
<v Speaker 2>worried about their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2240
01:46:35.570 --> 01:46:38.340
<v Speaker 2>the stupid wars and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

2241
01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:39.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that,</v>

2242
01:46:40.030 --> 01:46:41.820
<v Speaker 2>it's just obvious that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2243
01:46:41.821 --> 01:46:43.620
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2244
01:46:43.950 --> 01:46:48.090
<v Speaker 2>if we could stop creating needless pain </v>
<v Speaker 2>for ourselves or needles conflict,</v>

2245
01:46:48.091 --> 01:46:50.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would lead a much nicer life.</v>

2246
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:56.030
<v Speaker 2>But then there are the good things we </v>
<v Speaker 2>neglect to do based on the fact that we </v>

2247
01:46:56.030 --> 01:47:00.621
<v Speaker 2>just can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have a system where the </v>

2248
01:47:00.621 --> 01:47:01.710
<v Speaker 2>incentives are aligned to just make it </v>
<v Speaker 2>easy or,</v>

2249
01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:03.360
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2250
01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:09.560
<v Speaker 2>truly compelling to do them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the idea that we are not producing </v>

2251
01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:15.560
<v Speaker 2>the next generation of antibiotics as </v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly as possible is just unthinkable </v>

2252
01:47:16.261 --> 01:47:16.920
<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet,</v>

2253
01:47:16.921 --> 01:47:21.921
<v Speaker 2>and yet we simply were just hamstrung by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that we have a political and </v>

2254
01:47:21.921 --> 01:47:22.050
<v Speaker 2>economic system.</v>

2255
01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:24.180
<v Speaker 2>That is where the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2256
01:47:24.290 --> 01:47:26.190
<v Speaker 2>there's no incentive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2257
01:47:26.220 --> 01:47:28.470
<v Speaker 2>Like the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to raise taxes,</v>

2258
01:47:28.471 --> 01:47:28.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't,</v>

2259
01:47:29.070 --> 01:47:33.090
<v Speaker 2>we're so over committed in the ways we </v>
<v Speaker 2>spend money,</v>

2260
01:47:33.710 --> 01:47:35.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the public money,</v>

2261
01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:39.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're so short sighted that we,</v>

2262
01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:43.170
<v Speaker 2>even if we suddenly saved money in one </v>
<v Speaker 2>area,</v>

2263
01:47:43.171 --> 01:47:48.171
<v Speaker 2>it's not like we would immediately </v>
<v Speaker 2>directed to this lifesaving necessary </v>

2264
01:47:48.171 --> 01:47:48.171
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2265
01:47:48.171 --> 01:47:52.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the market can't get on top of this.</v>

2266
01:47:52.590 --> 01:47:53.700
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really would,</v>

2267
01:47:53.710 --> 01:47:55.350
<v Speaker 2>it would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2268
01:47:55.710 --> 01:47:57.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that,</v>

2269
01:47:57.060 --> 01:48:02.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bill and Melinda Gates Foundation </v>

2270
01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:03.921
<v Speaker 2>could do and maybe maybe they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually doing this and I just don't </v>

2271
01:48:03.921 --> 01:48:06.621
<v Speaker 2>know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're doing a lot of medical work </v>

2272
01:48:06.621 --> 01:48:06.621
<v Speaker 2>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2273
01:48:06.621 --> 01:48:06.621
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2274
01:48:06.621 --> 01:48:10.230
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about some billions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars to just get this.</v>

2275
01:48:10.330 --> 01:48:13.440
<v Speaker 2>You get kind of a laser focus on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on this problem.</v>

2276
01:48:13.470 --> 01:48:18.470
<v Speaker 2>But it's such an obvious problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really the only thing that's </v>

2277
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:18.470
<v Speaker 2>holding it back.</v>

2278
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:19.950
<v Speaker 2>That's what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a research issue,</v>

2279
01:48:19.951 --> 01:48:21.750
<v Speaker 2>it's just a financial issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2280
01:48:21.751 --> 01:48:23.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that the research has to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>done because it's,</v>

2281
01:48:23.971 --> 01:48:24.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it was,</v>

2282
01:48:24.630 --> 01:48:29.630
<v Speaker 2>if it was totally obvious how to build </v>
<v Speaker 2>the next generation of antibiotics that </v>

2283
01:48:29.630 --> 01:48:34.460
<v Speaker 2>would not be vulnerable to having their </v>
<v Speaker 2>efficacy canceled,</v>

2284
01:48:36.130 --> 01:48:36.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2285
01:48:36.810 --> 01:48:41.430
<v Speaker 2>in three years by just just the natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>selection among the microbes,</v>

2286
01:48:42.990 --> 01:48:45.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone would do it very,</v>

2287
01:48:45.421 --> 01:48:46.380
<v Speaker 2>very cheaply.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2288
01:48:46.980 --> 01:48:47.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

2289
01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:48.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2290
01:48:49.350 --> 01:48:51.840
<v Speaker 2>I'll admit that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably not easy to do,</v>

2291
01:48:51.841 --> 01:48:56.160
<v Speaker 2>but it's got to be doable and it's super</v>
<v Speaker 2>important to do.</v>

2292
01:48:56.161 --> 01:49:01.161
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you look at just what cesspools </v>

2293
01:49:01.161 --> 01:49:01.640
<v Speaker 2>hospitals have become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where people come at,</v>

2294
01:49:01.641 --> 01:49:05.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like 200,000</v>

2295
01:49:05.671 --> 01:49:10.671
<v Speaker 2>people a year die in the US based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially getting,</v>

2296
01:49:12.170 --> 01:49:14.850
<v Speaker 2>been getting killed by the machinery of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hospital right there,</v>

2297
01:49:14.851 --> 01:49:16.710
<v Speaker 2>getting killed by their doctors and </v>
<v Speaker 2>nurses.</v>

2298
01:49:17.220 --> 01:49:18.750
<v Speaker 2>Most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of this is,</v>

2299
01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:20.850
<v Speaker 2>is um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2300
01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:24.600
<v Speaker 2>drug overdoses or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

2301
01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:25.320
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2302
01:49:25.710 --> 01:49:30.710
<v Speaker 2>kind of incompetence in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in dosing or given some of the wrong </v>

2303
01:49:30.710 --> 01:49:30.710
<v Speaker 2>medication or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2304
01:49:30.710 --> 01:49:31.140
<v Speaker 2>200,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

2305
01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:32.340
<v Speaker 2>200,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people a year.</v>

2306
01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:37.400
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of it is just doctors not </v>

2307
01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:37.400
<v Speaker 2>washing their hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2308
01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:41.240
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some of this is also super bugs </v>

2309
01:49:41.240 --> 01:49:41.240
<v Speaker 2>where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2310
01:49:41.240 --> 01:49:44.910
<v Speaker 2>it's the burden on hand washing in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hospital is higher and higher because </v>

2311
01:49:45.031 --> 01:49:49.720
<v Speaker 2>hospitals just or just covered in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in super germs,</v>

2312
01:49:49.721 --> 01:49:51.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a,</v>

2313
01:49:51.971 --> 01:49:52.180
<v Speaker 2>a</v>

2314
01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:57.240
<v Speaker 3>cycle haunted house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to fix people and around </v>

2315
01:49:57.240 --> 01:50:01.171
<v Speaker 3>the house or a bunch of demons that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to kill people you're trying to </v>

2316
01:50:01.171 --> 01:50:01.171
<v Speaker 3>fix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that if look,</v>

2317
01:50:01.171 --> 01:50:05.611
<v Speaker 3>obviously it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you were a person who was </v>

2318
01:50:05.611 --> 01:50:09.061
<v Speaker 3>inclined to believe things like back in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the day before they figured out </v>

2319
01:50:09.061 --> 01:50:09.790
<v Speaker 3>microscopes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2320
01:50:09.791 --> 01:50:13.150
<v Speaker 3>what else is that other than a demon?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got a hospital that's filled with</v>

2321
01:50:13.151 --> 01:50:14.530
<v Speaker 3>super bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where else are they?</v>

2322
01:50:14.770 --> 01:50:19.770
<v Speaker 3>There's nowhere else in the hospitals </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Jim were they getting them?</v>

2323
01:50:20.531 --> 01:50:25.531
<v Speaker 3>Probably from the hospitals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just like a haunted house </v>

2324
01:50:25.531 --> 01:50:29.490
<v Speaker 3>circle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hunter House is trying to kill the </v>

2325
01:50:29.490 --> 01:50:29.490
<v Speaker 3>people that live in the house.</v>

2326
01:50:29.490 --> 01:50:33.040
<v Speaker 2>It is well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's also just ironic that you go to</v>

2327
01:50:33.041 --> 01:50:35.230
<v Speaker 2>the hospital to save your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2328
01:50:35.231 --> 01:50:40.000
<v Speaker 2>You go when you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by definition you're most vulnerable and</v>

2329
01:50:40.510 --> 01:50:45.510
<v Speaker 2>you are a and you're in your lane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body open to the intrusions of the </v>

2330
01:50:47.471 --> 01:50:50.170
<v Speaker 2>place because that means they have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get.</v>

2331
01:50:50.650 --> 01:50:53.020
<v Speaker 2>They have to get into your body to help </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

2332
01:50:53.021 --> 01:50:58.021
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yet that is the very mechanism </v>

2333
01:50:58.021 --> 01:51:02.430
<v Speaker 2>whereby you're getting all this misery </v>
<v Speaker 2>and death imposed on you and it's.</v>

2334
01:51:03.570 --> 01:51:06.160
<v Speaker 2>It is as simple as hand washing though </v>
<v Speaker 2>in many of these cases,</v>

2335
01:51:06.161 --> 01:51:08.530
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just doctors and nurses not washing</v>

2336
01:51:08.531 --> 01:51:10.750
<v Speaker 2>their hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is insane.</v>

2337
01:51:10.810 --> 01:51:15.810
<v Speaker 2>It's so insane to think that that is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>gigantic issue that we have these bugs </v>

2338
01:51:16.221 --> 01:51:18.590
<v Speaker 2>that tried to get into your body and </v>
<v Speaker 2>kill you is one.</v>

2339
01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:23.760
<v Speaker 2>So that's one area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you ever had the bad </v>

2340
01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:26.020
<v Speaker 2>luck to be associated with a Nicu and </v>
<v Speaker 2>neonatal Icu,</v>

2341
01:51:26.021 --> 01:51:31.021
<v Speaker 2>but our first daughter who's totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>fine was born five weeks early and had </v>

2342
01:51:31.571 --> 01:51:36.571
<v Speaker 2>to be in the Nicu for a week and there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are people who are in the Nicu for </v>

2343
01:51:36.571 --> 01:51:36.571
<v Speaker 2>months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2344
01:51:36.571 --> 01:51:39.550
<v Speaker 2>the babies born at 23 weeks or so.</v>

2345
01:51:40.210 --> 01:51:41.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's just,</v>

2346
01:51:41.890 --> 01:51:44.680
<v Speaker 2>it's just a totally heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2347
01:51:44.770 --> 01:51:49.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also just these incredibly </v>

2348
01:51:49.770 --> 01:51:52.651
<v Speaker 2>compassionate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just amazing places where you just </v>

2349
01:51:52.651 --> 01:51:53.050
<v Speaker 2>doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nurses or our total heroes,</v>

2350
01:51:53.950 --> 01:51:58.950
<v Speaker 2>but that's a space where you see the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand washing protocol just exactly as it</v>

2351
01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:01.360
<v Speaker 2>needs to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2352
01:52:01.361 --> 01:52:03.160
<v Speaker 2>like people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just have,</v>

2353
01:52:03.670 --> 01:52:05.630
<v Speaker 2>have understood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2354
01:52:05.710 --> 01:52:10.710
<v Speaker 2>finally that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to go into the Nicu and </v>

2355
01:52:10.710 --> 01:52:14.251
<v Speaker 2>see your baby or be around anyone else's</v>
<v Speaker 2>baby and you are going to wash your </v>

2356
01:52:14.251 --> 01:52:17.380
<v Speaker 2>hands in as complete way as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

2357
01:52:17.381 --> 01:52:19.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>21st century science.</v>

2358
01:52:19.121 --> 01:52:21.570
<v Speaker 2>Understand how to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's um,</v>

2359
01:52:21.740 --> 01:52:22.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

2360
01:52:22.471 --> 01:52:25.150
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like the decontamination </v>
<v Speaker 2>zone of,</v>

2361
01:52:25.180 --> 01:52:30.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Silkwood the nuclear reactor or she get </v>

2362
01:52:30.340 --> 01:52:31.930
<v Speaker 2>hosed down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2363
01:52:32.050 --> 01:52:32.850
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2364
01:52:33.850 --> 01:52:34.430
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>

2365
01:52:34.431 --> 01:52:37.690
<v Speaker 2>my hand washing and the fact that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't even do that perfectly.</v>

2366
01:52:37.691 --> 01:52:38.410
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty impressive.</v>

2367
01:52:39.660 --> 01:52:44.660
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it a fact that mercer was created by </v>

2368
01:52:44.660 --> 01:52:46.370
<v Speaker 3>medications or is that a belief or has </v>
<v Speaker 3>that been proven</v>

2369
01:52:46.430 --> 01:52:48.980
<v Speaker 2>that it was created by a resistance to </v>
<v Speaker 2>medications?</v>

2370
01:52:48.981 --> 01:52:50.810
<v Speaker 2>It gets stronger?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2371
01:52:50.811 --> 01:52:51.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2372
01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:56.520
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fact that all of these bugs are </v>

2373
01:52:56.960 --> 01:53:01.370
<v Speaker 2>evolving and just by dent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>happenstance,</v>

2374
01:53:01.670 --> 01:53:06.670
<v Speaker 2>they are producing a changes in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>genome that leaves them no longer </v>

2375
01:53:08.571 --> 01:53:11.750
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable to antibiotic X.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2376
01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:15.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so whether it's methicillin or,</v>

2377
01:53:15.230 --> 01:53:20.230
<v Speaker 2>or any of it's related antibiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that,</v>

2378
01:53:21.471 --> 01:53:23.360
<v Speaker 2>this is what antibiotic resistance is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>

2379
01:53:23.420 --> 01:53:25.070
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these bacteria,</v>

2380
01:53:25.570 --> 01:53:26.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2381
01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:32.020
<v Speaker 2>their genomes mutate and unfortunately </v>
<v Speaker 2>with bacteria they also can swap jeans </v>

2382
01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:38.920
<v Speaker 2>let laterally across bacterial species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like only their descendants </v>

2383
01:53:39.981 --> 01:53:44.360
<v Speaker 2>in that line can inherit that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these genetic changes they can,</v>

2384
01:53:44.390 --> 01:53:47.900
<v Speaker 2>they can transfer genetic changes across</v>
<v Speaker 2>bacteria.</v>

2385
01:53:48.140 --> 01:53:50.990
<v Speaker 2>So it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it optimizes the process.</v>

2386
01:53:51.110 --> 01:53:52.490
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is all blind.</v>

2387
01:53:52.491 --> 01:53:55.430
<v Speaker 2>It's not like bacteria want to become </v>
<v Speaker 2>drug resistant,</v>

2388
01:53:55.431 --> 01:54:00.431
<v Speaker 2>but some percentage of them in any </v>
<v Speaker 2>generation will tend to become in some </v>

2389
01:54:01.491 --> 01:54:06.491
<v Speaker 2>generation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will become drug resistant and then </v>

2390
01:54:06.491 --> 01:54:06.500
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then then in the presence of the drug,</v>

2391
01:54:07.010 --> 01:54:08.610
<v Speaker 2>they will be selected for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2392
01:54:08.730 --> 01:54:12.830
<v Speaker 2>if you keep bombarding people with </v>
<v Speaker 2>penicillin,</v>

2393
01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:19.960
<v Speaker 2>you will be selecting for the bacteria </v>
<v Speaker 2>that isn't sensitive to penicillin in </v>

2394
01:54:20.691 --> 01:54:25.691
<v Speaker 2>those people and say the overuse of </v>
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics and the overuse of </v>

2395
01:54:25.691 --> 01:54:27.620
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics in our food chain is also </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of this picture.</v>

2396
01:54:27.650 --> 01:54:29.690
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's the fact that we are,</v>

2397
01:54:30.620 --> 01:54:32.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the percentage is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

2398
01:54:32.970 --> 01:54:37.880
<v Speaker 2>it's more antibiotic use certainly in </v>
<v Speaker 2>cattle and pigs than in,</v>

2399
01:54:38.530 --> 01:54:39.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2400
01:54:40.070 --> 01:54:44.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the same evolutionary principles are</v>

2401
01:54:44.721 --> 01:54:46.100
<v Speaker 2>happening there too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2402
01:54:46.230 --> 01:54:48.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you don't know what,</v>

2403
01:54:48.890 --> 01:54:51.940
<v Speaker 2>what we're doing to ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2404
01:54:52.110 --> 01:54:57.050
<v Speaker 2>it can't be good to be using antibiotics</v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere in agriculture.</v>

2405
01:54:57.080 --> 01:54:59.600
<v Speaker 2>And then kind of waiting to see what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>

2406
01:54:59.630 --> 01:55:04.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know for a fact that we get diseases </v>

2407
01:55:04.630 --> 01:55:04.630
<v Speaker 2>mean swine flu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>avian flu like Josie,</v>

2408
01:55:04.630 --> 01:55:05.330
<v Speaker 2>no viruses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2409
01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:10.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of these are coming out of </v>

2410
01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:10.790
<v Speaker 2>these facilities where they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>processing cattle,</v>

2411
01:55:11.950 --> 01:55:12.880
<v Speaker 2>pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2412
01:55:12.881 --> 01:55:17.881
<v Speaker 2>that's another element to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's just that most of infectious </v>

2413
01:55:17.881 --> 01:55:21.491
<v Speaker 2>disease over the ages has been born of </v>
<v Speaker 2>proximity to animals and that's the </v>

2414
01:55:24.171 --> 01:55:29.030
<v Speaker 2>result of agriculture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the fact that you have people in bird</v>

2415
01:55:29.031 --> 01:55:31.900
<v Speaker 2>markets in China who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2416
01:55:31.910 --> 01:55:36.910
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're dealing with with chickens and </v>

2417
01:55:36.910 --> 01:55:40.610
<v Speaker 2>ducks endlessly in confinement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you've got,</v>

2418
01:55:40.630 --> 01:55:43.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wild birds flying overhead,</v>

2419
01:55:43.230 --> 01:55:47.490
<v Speaker 2>dropping their droppings into that space</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have,</v>

2420
01:55:47.550 --> 01:55:51.300
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have a viruses that jump species</v>

2421
01:55:51.301 --> 01:55:53.880
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from birds to pigs and back again.</v>

2422
01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:55.320
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2423
01:55:55.321 --> 01:55:59.230
<v Speaker 2>some of the stuff only stays in those </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals and,</v>

2424
01:55:59.231 --> 01:56:02.700
<v Speaker 2>and doesn't become active and people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

2425
01:56:02.701 --> 01:56:03.400
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like,</v>

2426
01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:06.780
<v Speaker 2>is this evolution is just this endless </v>
<v Speaker 2>lottery,</v>

2427
01:56:06.781 --> 01:56:11.781
<v Speaker 2>we'll where it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just got change and change and </v>

2428
01:56:11.781 --> 01:56:14.031
<v Speaker 2>change upon change and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something makes the jump in this case </v>

2429
01:56:17.731 --> 01:56:22.731
<v Speaker 2>between species and thrives or not based</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the opportunities to thrive.</v>

2430
01:56:23.671 --> 01:56:26.160
<v Speaker 2>So you have something that becomes </v>
<v Speaker 2>airborne,</v>

2431
01:56:26.220 --> 01:56:26.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have,</v>

2432
01:56:26.810 --> 01:56:28.170
<v Speaker 2>you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2433
01:56:28.171 --> 01:56:33.171
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a virus that is absolutely deadly and </v>

2434
01:56:33.171 --> 01:56:36.591
<v Speaker 2>people but isn't airborne and is </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult to contract,</v>

2435
01:56:36.811 --> 01:56:37.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2436
01:56:37.111 --> 01:56:39.480
<v Speaker 2>then it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fairly well behaved,</v>

2437
01:56:39.481 --> 01:56:40.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be scary,</v>

2438
01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:43.230
<v Speaker 2>but it's not going to become a global </v>
<v Speaker 2>pandemic,</v>

2439
01:56:43.231 --> 01:56:48.231
<v Speaker 2>but then suddenly you could get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mutation on that virus or that bacteria </v>

2440
01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:50.610
<v Speaker 2>that allows it to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2441
01:56:50.670 --> 01:56:55.670
<v Speaker 2>aspirated in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>become airborne and a cough and hailed </v>

2442
01:56:55.670 --> 01:56:57.060
<v Speaker 2>and big and spread that way.</v>

2443
01:56:57.600 --> 01:56:59.280
<v Speaker 2>Well then you have this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2444
01:56:59.281 --> 01:57:00.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2445
01:57:00.300 --> 01:57:05.300
<v Speaker 2>the possibility of a pandemic and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also the time course of an illness </v>

2446
01:57:06.271 --> 01:57:07.650
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is irrelevant.</v>

2447
01:57:07.651 --> 01:57:12.651
<v Speaker 2>So you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have something which kills you very </v>

2448
01:57:12.651 --> 01:57:13.230
<v Speaker 2>quickly and horribly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then that's,</v>

2449
01:57:13.260 --> 01:57:18.260
<v Speaker 2>that's the kind of thing that is going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be harder to spread because people </v>

2450
01:57:18.631 --> 01:57:20.460
<v Speaker 2>become suddenly so sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>

2451
01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:23.610
<v Speaker 2>they're not getting on airplanes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to conferences,</v>

2452
01:57:24.420 --> 01:57:26.330
<v Speaker 2>they're not starting new relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

2453
01:57:26.540 --> 01:57:28.470
<v Speaker 2>they're in bed dying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2454
01:57:28.471 --> 01:57:31.290
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you had something that had a time</v>

2455
01:57:31.291 --> 01:57:35.700
<v Speaker 2>course that you felt great for a month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're yet your infectious,</v>

2456
01:57:36.180 --> 01:57:38.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it kills you will then,</v>

2457
01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:44.120
<v Speaker 2>then it's spread is only limited by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>damage you can do in that month of </v>

2458
01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:45.330
<v Speaker 2>gallivanting around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2459
01:57:45.331 --> 01:57:45.840
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2460
01:57:46.350 --> 01:57:47.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

2461
01:57:47.911 --> 01:57:49.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

2462
01:57:49.261 --> 01:57:51.690
<v Speaker 2>these mutations are just happening </v>
<v Speaker 2>spontaneously.</v>

2463
01:57:51.750 --> 01:57:53.280
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

2464
01:57:53.340 --> 01:57:55.200
<v Speaker 2>it really is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2465
01:57:56.100 --> 01:58:00.990
<v Speaker 2>it's a matter of good and bad luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all have one function.</v>

2466
01:58:01.780 --> 01:58:04.530
<v Speaker 2>What killed things they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

2467
01:58:04.531 --> 01:58:09.531
<v Speaker 2>they overcome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they overcome bodies with their life </v>

2468
01:58:09.531 --> 01:58:09.531
<v Speaker 2>form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They spread.</v>

2469
01:58:09.531 --> 01:58:11.910
<v Speaker 2>Will there have met their other </v>
<v Speaker 2>functions.</v>

2470
01:58:11.911 --> 01:58:16.911
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously this is all blind and there </v>

2471
01:58:16.911 --> 01:58:19.660
<v Speaker 2>was no intention or purpose behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are viruses and other </v>

2472
01:58:23.281 --> 01:58:27.040
<v Speaker 2>infectious diseases that produce </v>
<v Speaker 2>penicillin know that.</v>

2473
01:58:27.060 --> 01:58:30.300
<v Speaker 2>But the produce functions which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are behaviorally relevant.</v>

2474
01:58:30.301 --> 01:58:33.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that there was a spread and forgotten</v>

2475
01:58:33.450 --> 01:58:34.410
<v Speaker 2>is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2476
01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:40.280
<v Speaker 2>so toxoplasmosis it makes mice less </v>
<v Speaker 2>fearful and the presence of cats.</v>

2477
01:58:41.940 --> 01:58:42.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2478
01:58:42.450 --> 01:58:42.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2479
01:58:42.890 --> 01:58:46.360
<v Speaker 1>so like say the behavioral changes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes them attracted to urine,</v>

2480
01:58:46.510 --> 01:58:49.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get erect right around cat urine.</v>

2481
01:58:50.110 --> 01:58:55.110
<v Speaker 1>So he's into their demise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it spreads to cats and there are </v>

2482
01:58:55.110 --> 01:58:55.110
<v Speaker 1>theses that that either</v>

2483
01:58:55.340 --> 01:58:58.320
<v Speaker 2>infectious diseases that change human </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior that,</v>

2484
01:58:58.370 --> 01:59:03.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the depression is the result of </v>

2485
01:59:03.370 --> 01:59:07.010
<v Speaker 2>infectious illness that we're not aware </v>
<v Speaker 2>of or um,</v>

2486
01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:10.730
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2487
01:59:10.790 --> 01:59:15.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's a lot that could be going </v>

2488
01:59:15.790 --> 01:59:18.050
<v Speaker 2>wrong with us that we haven't attributed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to viruses and bacteria,</v>

2489
01:59:18.051 --> 01:59:21.080
<v Speaker 2>which in fact are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is at bottom a matter of a virus,</v>

2490
01:59:21.170 --> 01:59:22.250
<v Speaker 2>viruses and bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

2491
01:59:22.251 --> 01:59:27.251
<v Speaker 2>Alzheimer's is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was recently a report that </v>

2492
01:59:27.251 --> 01:59:31.870
<v Speaker 2>suggested that Alzheimer's is the result</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a brain's immune response to </v>

2493
01:59:36.590 --> 01:59:38.090
<v Speaker 2>infection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>infectious illness,</v>

2494
01:59:38.230 --> 01:59:39.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2495
01:59:39.080 --> 01:59:42.500
<v Speaker 2>I think it was bacterial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2496
01:59:42.710 --> 01:59:46.160
<v Speaker 2>this is just in the last week or so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2497
01:59:46.790 --> 01:59:51.790
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the plaques associated with Alzheimer's </v>

2498
01:59:51.790 --> 01:59:55.181
<v Speaker 2>that you see throughout the brain might </v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact be the remnants of an immune </v>

2499
01:59:57.351 --> 02:00:01.370
<v Speaker 2>response to some something having </v>
<v Speaker 2>invaded the cross,</v>

2500
02:00:01.520 --> 02:00:03.740
<v Speaker 2>the blood brain barrier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2501
02:00:04.400 --> 02:00:09.400
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if Alzheimer's is the result of </v>

2502
02:00:09.400 --> 02:00:11.120
<v Speaker 2>infectious disease and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a score that as a,</v>

2503
02:00:11.121 --> 02:00:12.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>

2504
02:00:12.310 --> 02:00:17.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a major problem that would be nice to </v>

2505
02:00:17.310 --> 02:00:18.410
<v Speaker 2>solve with the right antibiotic regime.</v>

2506
02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:19.750
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2507
02:00:19.751 --> 02:00:22.530
<v Speaker 1>that would have been fascinated if that </v>
<v Speaker 1>existed during Reagan's time.</v>

2508
02:00:22.531 --> 02:00:26.170
<v Speaker 1>I think it just clear them up because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you remember when he will,</v>

2509
02:00:26.190 --> 02:00:30.340
<v Speaker 1>like when when someone publicly starts </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go like that and it's a,</v>

2510
02:00:30.350 --> 02:00:35.350
<v Speaker 1>a guy like Ronald Reagan who was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>actor and a president and you see him </v>

2511
02:00:35.351 --> 02:00:37.940
<v Speaker 1>starting to lose his grip on his memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You knew,</v>

2512
02:00:37.941 --> 02:00:42.941
<v Speaker 1>you hear all the reports about it that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a particularly disturbing because </v>

2513
02:00:43.361 --> 02:00:45.670
<v Speaker 1>it's exhibited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means that's the head guy,</v>

2514
02:00:45.820 --> 02:00:48.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to think that that was just a disease.</v>

2515
02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:49.480
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

2516
02:00:49.490 --> 02:00:51.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2517
02:00:51.230 --> 02:00:55.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember when that became at all</v>
<v Speaker 2>obvious.</v>

2518
02:00:55.340 --> 02:00:56.380
<v Speaker 2>I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2519
02:00:56.400 --> 02:01:00.740
<v Speaker 2>I know people were trying to do a kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a retrospective analysis of it,</v>

2520
02:01:00.741 --> 02:01:05.741
<v Speaker 2>but I don't remember when anyone started</v>
<v Speaker 2>to talk about the possibility that he </v>

2521
02:01:07.700 --> 02:01:12.700
<v Speaker 2>was not all there and I don't remember </v>
<v Speaker 2>it happening actually during his </v>

2522
02:01:13.161 --> 02:01:14.220
<v Speaker 2>presidency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but know</v>

2523
02:01:14.830 --> 02:01:16.360
<v Speaker 1>you were both young at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2524
02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:21.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do remember comedians doing jokes </v>

2525
02:01:21.640 --> 02:01:21.640
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2526
02:01:21.640 --> 02:01:23.590
<v Speaker 1>That's like one of my main points of </v>
<v Speaker 1>references or we'll.</v>

2527
02:01:24.020 --> 02:01:29.020
<v Speaker 1>They did have this like weird sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of it grandpa type character that </v>

2528
02:01:29.020 --> 02:01:32.380
<v Speaker 1>they would do towards his second run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2529
02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:38.640
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that was years before </v>

2530
02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:39.350
<v Speaker 1>they were referencing like when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when was it all going bad them?</v>

2531
02:01:39.890 --> 02:01:42.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean neurologists are very neurologist</v>

2532
02:01:42.741 --> 02:01:46.910
<v Speaker 1>can spot neurological illness really </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

2533
02:01:46.940 --> 02:01:47.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2534
02:01:47.650 --> 02:01:51.530
<v Speaker 1>they are walking around seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurological illness all over the place.</v>

2535
02:01:51.531 --> 02:01:56.531
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there were neurologists who </v>
<v Speaker 1>were talking about him long before </v>

2536
02:01:57.500 --> 02:01:59.210
<v Speaker 1>anyone else was in those terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2537
02:01:59.211 --> 02:02:01.980
<v Speaker 1>there was this old joke that Jimmy </v>
<v Speaker 1>tingled did.</v>

2538
02:02:02.030 --> 02:02:05.300
<v Speaker 1>Timmy tingles hilarious political </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedian from Boston.</v>

2539
02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:10.510
<v Speaker 1>He had this joke about a Ronald Reagan's</v>
<v Speaker 1>trial where he couldn't remember if he </v>

2540
02:02:10.510 --> 02:02:11.030
<v Speaker 1>sold arms to Iran.</v>

2541
02:02:11.460 --> 02:02:16.460
<v Speaker 1>It was Mr to President next time you </v>
<v Speaker 1>sell ams to Iran,</v>

2542
02:02:17.690 --> 02:02:20.870
<v Speaker 1>jotted down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a note,</v>

2543
02:02:21.140 --> 02:02:24.380
<v Speaker 1>put it on the refrigerator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was just.</v>

2544
02:02:24.810 --> 02:02:29.300
<v Speaker 1>That was his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was his excuse when he was in trial</v>

2545
02:02:29.301 --> 02:02:31.730
<v Speaker 1>and everybody thought that this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>

2546
02:02:31.731 --> 02:02:33.680
<v Speaker 1>This is his defense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't remember,</v>

2547
02:02:33.860 --> 02:02:35.270
<v Speaker 1>and then it started coming out that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>had.</v>

2548
02:02:35.271 --> 02:02:37.550
<v Speaker 1>And then the conspiracy theory was he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was always fine.</v>

2549
02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:42.760
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that guy's name Vincent the Chin </v>

2550
02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:43.100
<v Speaker 1>Gigante who'd walk around in a bathrobe </v>
<v Speaker 1>and pretend to be crazy.</v>

2551
02:02:43.700 --> 02:02:45.020
<v Speaker 1>I remember that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mob guy.</v>

2552
02:02:45.050 --> 02:02:48.230
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a famous mob guy who was running</v>

2553
02:02:48.231 --> 02:02:50.390
<v Speaker 1>the mob but pretending to be a crazy old</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2554
02:02:50.510 --> 02:02:53.900
<v Speaker 1>So he would walk around with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget how they busted him,</v>

2555
02:02:54.110 --> 02:02:59.110
<v Speaker 1>but he had it nailed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd walked around the bath robe and </v>

2556
02:02:59.110 --> 02:03:02.231
<v Speaker 1>talk to himself and he will put on an </v>
<v Speaker 1>act like going on the street and act </v>

2557
02:03:02.231 --> 02:03:02.231
<v Speaker 1>like a crazy person.</v>

2558
02:03:02.231 --> 02:03:04.460
<v Speaker 1>And then he would go on walks with like </v>
<v Speaker 1>these capos and tell them,</v>

2559
02:03:04.461 --> 02:03:09.461
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill this fucking guy and get me a </v>

2560
02:03:09.461 --> 02:03:09.461
<v Speaker 1>million bucks and all that kind of crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2561
02:03:09.461 --> 02:03:12.230
<v Speaker 1>But all the while he had an world wire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some somehow or another they caught him.</v>

2562
02:03:12.231 --> 02:03:13.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember exactly how they caught</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

2563
02:03:14.150 --> 02:03:17.390
<v Speaker 1>but everyone knew like they kind of knew</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was doing that.</v>

2564
02:03:17.391 --> 02:03:19.430
<v Speaker 1>And so some people were thinking that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what Reagan was doing.</v>

2565
02:03:19.810 --> 02:03:21.380
<v Speaker 1>It was getting closer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what I did,</v>

2566
02:03:21.381 --> 02:03:23.120
<v Speaker 1>what I ran in a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember shit.</v>

2567
02:03:23.390 --> 02:03:28.390
<v Speaker 1>I can't think I got a disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember anything and just </v>

2568
02:03:28.390 --> 02:03:29.540
<v Speaker 1>started pretending was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be both.</v>

2569
02:03:29.541 --> 02:03:34.541
<v Speaker 1>Could be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he could only clearly did have </v>

2570
02:03:34.541 --> 02:03:34.541
<v Speaker 1>Alzheimer's in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he could have also been lying.</v>

2571
02:03:35.300 --> 02:03:40.300
<v Speaker 1>What if it was a big conspiracy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'll be a great movie like how good </v>

2572
02:03:40.300 --> 02:03:43.961
<v Speaker 1>of an actor was Ronald Reagan who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>such a good actor to the latter days of </v>

2573
02:03:43.961 --> 02:03:43.961
<v Speaker 1>his years.</v>

2574
02:03:43.961 --> 02:03:45.110
<v Speaker 1>You've avoided interviews by pretending </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have Alzheimer's.</v>

2575
02:03:45.470 --> 02:03:47.870
<v Speaker 1>He felt like that was the only way out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it just.</v>

2576
02:03:47.930 --> 02:03:50.510
<v Speaker 1>Him and Nancy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they prepped her lines and when,</v>

2577
02:03:50.930 --> 02:03:53.180
<v Speaker 1>when you know he'd go out there to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>public,</v>

2578
02:03:53.181 --> 02:03:55.070
<v Speaker 1>he just started acting like he couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember anything.</v>

2579
02:03:56.480 --> 02:04:01.480
<v Speaker 1>Alzheimer's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately it's going to be a bigger </v>

2580
02:04:01.480 --> 02:04:03.341
<v Speaker 1>and bigger story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really a baby boomer moment is </v>

2581
02:04:03.341 --> 02:04:07.120
<v Speaker 1>coming and it's just going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something we need a full court </v>

2582
02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:07.370
<v Speaker 1>press on to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2583
02:04:07.820 --> 02:04:12.050
<v Speaker 1>If you can find that that's actually a </v>
<v Speaker 1>disease and you can cure that disease.</v>

2584
02:04:12.070 --> 02:04:15.340
<v Speaker 1>That's a disease and infectious disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2585
02:04:15.350 --> 02:04:20.350
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you ever seen the support stuff on </v>

2586
02:04:20.350 --> 02:04:23.261
<v Speaker 1>the Toxoplasma Robertson Stanford,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the guy that's like one of the four</v>

2587
02:04:25.070 --> 02:04:30.070
<v Speaker 1>forefront researchers and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys is like really vocal about stress </v>

2588
02:04:30.070 --> 02:04:30.140
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>

2589
02:04:30.170 --> 02:04:35.170
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were also talking about a direct </v>

2590
02:04:35.170 --> 02:04:35.630
<v Speaker 1>proportionate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a direct relationship between motorcycle</v>

2591
02:04:35.631 --> 02:04:40.631
<v Speaker 1>crashes and testing positive for </v>
<v Speaker 1>toxoplasmosis and they felt,</v>

2592
02:04:41.551 --> 02:04:46.551
<v Speaker 1>they felt that it might've either </v>
<v Speaker 1>hindered reaction time or loosened </v>

2593
02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:51.770
<v Speaker 1>inhibitions to same way it sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>triggers these mice to go near cats.</v>

2594
02:04:51.790 --> 02:04:52.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2595
02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:53.640
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was referencing.</v>

2596
02:04:53.690 --> 02:04:57.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's a lot of,</v>

2597
02:04:57.461 --> 02:04:59.900
<v Speaker 1>it's speculation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of strong court.</v>

2598
02:04:59.901 --> 02:05:03.600
<v Speaker 1>There's a strong correlation apparently </v>
<v Speaker 1>to motorcycle crashes and that is,</v>

2599
02:05:03.810 --> 02:05:08.810
<v Speaker 1>I guess one of his professors had told </v>
<v Speaker 1>him that when he was younger and he </v>

2600
02:05:08.810 --> 02:05:12.770
<v Speaker 1>remembered it while they were dealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with some guy who came into the er </v>

2601
02:05:12.770 --> 02:05:15.150
<v Speaker 1>victim of motorcycle crash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it kind of makes sense.</v>

2602
02:05:16.470 --> 02:05:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2603
02:05:17.011 --> 02:05:22.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the underlying biology of risk avoidance</v>

2604
02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:26.550
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not risk seeking is,</v>

2605
02:05:26.820 --> 02:05:31.820
<v Speaker 1>that's fairly well conserved in mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like there's a reason why we do</v>

2606
02:05:33.060 --> 02:05:37.110
<v Speaker 1>most of our research in things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>mice.</v>

2607
02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:40.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a totally analogous brain,</v>

2608
02:05:40.771 --> 02:05:44.420
<v Speaker 1>but it's are similar enough to us that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2609
02:05:44.430 --> 02:05:47.400
<v Speaker 1>doing research on dopamine receptors in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mice is,</v>

2610
02:05:48.120 --> 02:05:52.850
<v Speaker 1>allows us to extrapolate to humans and </v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2611
02:05:53.130 --> 02:05:54.420
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a um,</v>

2612
02:05:55.630 --> 02:05:56.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

2613
02:05:56.891 --> 02:06:00.450
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be a surprise that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>having an effect on people.</v>

2614
02:06:00.870 --> 02:06:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Was it Steve?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember I was supposed to bring this up</v>

2615
02:06:04.171 --> 02:06:05.330
<v Speaker 1>to you before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2616
02:06:05.400 --> 02:06:06.780
<v Speaker 1>when you were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2617
02:06:06.900 --> 02:06:10.110
<v Speaker 1>plants and plants having some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

2618
02:06:10.380 --> 02:06:12.510
<v Speaker 1>was it steven pinker see if you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>find this?</v>

2619
02:06:12.720 --> 02:06:17.720
<v Speaker 1>Who gave a speech where he talked about </v>
<v Speaker 1>how some plants you can actually use </v>

2620
02:06:18.421 --> 02:06:23.421
<v Speaker 1>sedatives on them and that some of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually produced certain neurochemicals</v>

2621
02:06:24.090 --> 02:06:29.090
<v Speaker 1>like dopamine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that makes any sense that Steven </v>

2622
02:06:29.090 --> 02:06:29.090
<v Speaker 1>pinker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2623
02:06:29.090 --> 02:06:29.520
<v Speaker 1>it didn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2624
02:06:29.820 --> 02:06:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was surprised me if pinker said </v>

2625
02:06:34.820 --> 02:06:34.820
<v Speaker 1>anything about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't heard anything about it.</v>

2626
02:06:34.820 --> 02:06:36.960
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a speech he was given </v>
<v Speaker 1>about something,</v>

2627
02:06:36.961 --> 02:06:41.961
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why I wanted to </v>

2628
02:06:41.961 --> 02:06:44.331
<v Speaker 1>bring it up to you because I had never </v>
<v Speaker 1>heard that before that a plant can </v>

2629
02:06:44.331 --> 02:06:48.680
<v Speaker 1>produce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was either dopamine or Serotonin in </v>

2630
02:06:48.680 --> 02:06:49.290
<v Speaker 1>that somehow or another sedatives would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

2631
02:06:50.610 --> 02:06:53.040
<v Speaker 1>would be effective on a plant.</v>

2632
02:06:53.370 --> 02:06:56.910
<v Speaker 1>I tell it didn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what effective means.</v>

2633
02:06:56.990 --> 02:06:57.930
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know either.</v>

2634
02:06:57.931 --> 02:07:01.620
<v Speaker 1>That's why I waited for you have a plant</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty.</v>

2635
02:07:01.621 --> 02:07:03.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a dated as far as I'm concerned.</v>

2636
02:07:03.060 --> 02:07:04.490
<v Speaker 1>I remember as soon as I saw this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2637
02:07:04.740 --> 02:07:07.860
<v Speaker 1>must get this to Sam Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please decipher.</v>

2638
02:07:08.640 --> 02:07:13.640
<v Speaker 1>But I actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything I almost everything I </v>

2639
02:07:13.640 --> 02:07:15.720
<v Speaker 1>remember about or that I learned about </v>
<v Speaker 1>plant biology I've forgotten.</v>

2640
02:07:15.721 --> 02:07:19.830
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty sure if you can't find it</v>

2641
02:07:19.860 --> 02:07:24.270
<v Speaker 1>does not have a brain stuff for Steven </v>
<v Speaker 1>pinker and in plants and consciousness,</v>

2642
02:07:24.271 --> 02:07:27.140
<v Speaker 1>but nothing with sedatives specifically </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming up with that.</v>

2643
02:07:27.390 --> 02:07:29.380
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I can come.</v>

2644
02:07:29.430 --> 02:07:32.610
<v Speaker 1>What's the combined two different </v>
<v Speaker 1>articles they made?</v>

2645
02:07:32.630 --> 02:07:34.380
<v Speaker 1>Did the pink one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it was.</v>

2646
02:07:34.450 --> 02:07:36.010
<v Speaker 1>What did what pinker say about</v>

2647
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:37.450
<v Speaker 3>plants and consciousness?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2648
02:07:37.451 --> 02:07:41.170
<v Speaker 3>he was just talking about the surprising</v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of calculations.</v>

2649
02:07:41.350 --> 02:07:42.580
<v Speaker 3>I think that was one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2650
02:07:42.680 --> 02:07:45.340
<v Speaker 3>we'd have to read the entire piece,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it was just,</v>

2651
02:07:45.370 --> 02:07:50.370
<v Speaker 3>they were just highlighting what we know</v>
<v Speaker 3>so far I've reached the limits of the </v>

2652
02:07:50.370 --> 02:07:50.370
<v Speaker 3>human bladder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2653
02:07:50.370 --> 02:07:53.230
<v Speaker 3>how dare you this early.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're too healthy,</v>

2654
02:07:53.231 --> 02:07:54.550
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Coffee and water.</v>

2655
02:07:55.390 --> 02:07:56.860
<v Speaker 3>So what have you found on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie?</v>

2656
02:07:57.480 --> 02:08:00.440
<v Speaker 4>Not really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing specific about it,</v>

2657
02:08:00.441 --> 02:08:03.770
<v Speaker 4>but I did have something earlier that </v>
<v Speaker 4>was kind of interesting.</v>

2658
02:08:04.010 --> 02:08:06.020
<v Speaker 4>I'll show it to you here when you was </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about Ai.</v>

2659
02:08:06.021 --> 02:08:09.470
<v Speaker 4>I put up something on minority report </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that pulled me to this article,</v>

2660
02:08:09.950 --> 02:08:14.240
<v Speaker 4>which Microsoft has an app that can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's actually developed by Hitachi.</v>

2661
02:08:14.750 --> 02:08:18.200
<v Speaker 4>It's called predictive crime and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>analytics,</v>

2662
02:08:19.090 --> 02:08:22.430
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can predict crimes up to 91 percent</v>

2663
02:08:22.431 --> 02:08:27.431
<v Speaker 4>accuracy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's also already being </v>

2664
02:08:27.431 --> 02:08:30.800
<v Speaker 4>enacted at Maryland and Pennsylvania as </v>
<v Speaker 4>of 2013.</v>

2665
02:08:31.520 --> 02:08:36.520
<v Speaker 4>They have crime prediction software that</v>
<v Speaker 4>can find out if an inmate that's going </v>

2666
02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:38.480
<v Speaker 4>to be released is going to predict or </v>
<v Speaker 4>committed another crime.</v>

2667
02:08:39.050 --> 02:08:40.880
<v Speaker 4>And so they're using that to follow </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2668
02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:43.470
<v Speaker 4>And there's some civil rights people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are saying like,</v>

2669
02:08:43.490 --> 02:08:45.800
<v Speaker 4>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously that's not good.</v>

2670
02:08:46.290 --> 02:08:47.940
<v Speaker 3>Hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scroll down just a little bit.</v>

2671
02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:51.150
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Professor Burke says his algorithm could</v>

2672
02:08:51.151 --> 02:08:56.151
<v Speaker 3>be used to help set bail amounts and </v>
<v Speaker 3>also decides sentences in the future.</v>

2673
02:08:56.560 --> 02:08:58.720
<v Speaker 4>And then I got down to this part in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Chicago.</v>

2674
02:08:58.721 --> 02:09:00.130
<v Speaker 4>They're doing something and they have </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2675
02:09:00.190 --> 02:09:05.190
<v Speaker 4>It's called a heat list in Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have 400 residents that are listed </v>

2676
02:09:05.190 --> 02:09:09.061
<v Speaker 4>as potential victims and subjects with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the greatest propensity of violence and </v>

2677
02:09:09.061 --> 02:09:10.840
<v Speaker 4>they go and knock on their door and tell</v>
<v Speaker 4>them that they're being watched.</v>

2678
02:09:11.620 --> 02:09:16.620
<v Speaker 4>And I like I've clicked on this thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's an actual like Chicago </v>

2679
02:09:16.620 --> 02:09:20.311
<v Speaker 4>directive from the police.org.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a pilot program about going and </v>

2680
02:09:20.311 --> 02:09:24.811
<v Speaker 4>tell people that are being watched for </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone might be after you or some shit </v>

2681
02:09:24.811 --> 02:09:27.280
<v Speaker 4>like that out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really crazy.</v>

2682
02:09:27.390 --> 02:09:29.200
<v Speaker 4>I didn't want to interrupt you guys to </v>
<v Speaker 4>tell you about this,</v>

2683
02:09:29.201 --> 02:09:29.440
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

2684
02:09:29.520 --> 02:09:34.170
<v Speaker 3>custom notification under the violence </v>
<v Speaker 3>reduction initiative in partnership with</v>

2685
02:09:34.171 --> 02:09:39.171
<v Speaker 3>the John Jay College of criminal justice</v>
<v Speaker 3>community team who will serve as </v>

2686
02:09:39.460 --> 02:09:43.260
<v Speaker 3>outreach partners when the social </v>
<v Speaker 3>service and community partners show show</v>

2687
02:09:43.261 --> 02:09:44.700
<v Speaker 3>him this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is crazy.</v>

2688
02:09:44.701 --> 02:09:49.701
<v Speaker 3>While the while we were doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Microsoft has this,</v>

2689
02:09:50.430 --> 02:09:52.500
<v Speaker 3>these programs scroll up to the top </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>

2690
02:09:54.360 --> 02:09:59.360
<v Speaker 3>They revealed an application they think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that can predict crimes in the future </v>

2691
02:09:59.360 --> 02:10:01.200
<v Speaker 3>and decide if inmates get parole.</v>

2692
02:10:01.900 --> 02:10:04.900
<v Speaker 4>It uses all sorts of data,</v>
<v Speaker 4>public data from twitter,</v>

2693
02:10:05.070 --> 02:10:09.370
<v Speaker 4>a closed circuit camera feeds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>public Wifi signals.</v>

2694
02:10:09.590 --> 02:10:14.590
<v Speaker 4>There's like an la.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's all sorts of microphones all </v>

2695
02:10:14.590 --> 02:10:14.590
<v Speaker 4>over the place listening for gunshots </v>
<v Speaker 4>and whatnot.</v>

2696
02:10:14.590 --> 02:10:19.360
<v Speaker 4>There's this New Light Poles I told you </v>
<v Speaker 4>about that are adding four g </v>

2697
02:10:19.360 --> 02:10:22.500
<v Speaker 4>connectivity to the city that obviously </v>
<v Speaker 4>can be added to this probably if they </v>

2698
02:10:22.500 --> 02:10:22.500
<v Speaker 4>needed it.</v>

2699
02:10:22.500 --> 02:10:23.360
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2700
02:10:23.361 --> 02:10:24.900
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't surprise me at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2701
02:10:24.940 --> 02:10:26.240
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that is a,</v>

2702
02:10:26.241 --> 02:10:29.000
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of that's come in.</v>

2703
02:10:29.001 --> 02:10:31.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean it would just look at just </v>
<v Speaker 3>consumer behavior.</v>

2704
02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:34.250
<v Speaker 3>We just just look at how someone</v>

2705
02:10:34.250 --> 02:10:39.250
<v Speaker 2>can understand about you based on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>zip code and your last three Netflix </v>

2706
02:10:40.521 --> 02:10:44.510
<v Speaker 2>movies you watch to the end and it just </v>
<v Speaker 2>a few other data points,</v>

2707
02:10:44.511 --> 02:10:49.511
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we basically know we can </v>

2708
02:10:49.511 --> 02:10:49.511
<v Speaker 2>predict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2709
02:10:49.511 --> 02:10:52.820
<v Speaker 2>with some horrendous accuracy what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to like a given,</v>

2710
02:10:52.850 --> 02:10:54.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the menu of options.</v>

2711
02:10:54.051 --> 02:10:55.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can advertise to you,</v>

2712
02:10:55.570 --> 02:10:56.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

2713
02:10:56.620 --> 02:11:00.560
<v Speaker 2>with immense precision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in facebook,</v>

2714
02:11:00.561 --> 02:11:02.660
<v Speaker 2>obviously is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is at the forefront of this,</v>

2715
02:11:02.661 --> 02:11:05.330
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you talk about,</v>

2716
02:11:07.010 --> 02:11:12.010
<v Speaker 2>when you add everything else that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming more and more intrusive </v>

2717
02:11:13.100 --> 02:11:14.840
<v Speaker 2>technology of the sort we've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>

2718
02:11:14.841 --> 02:11:15.920
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2719
02:11:17.270 --> 02:11:18.830
<v Speaker 2>none of that surprising,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2720
02:11:18.980 --> 02:11:23.720
<v Speaker 1>Nothing surprising anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had read that 30 years ago,</v>

2721
02:11:24.110 --> 02:11:26.060
<v Speaker 1>it would have looked like an article in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the onion here,</v>

2722
02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:26.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like,</v>

2723
02:11:26.960 --> 02:11:28.820
<v Speaker 1>what they're going to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is judge dredd.</v>

2724
02:11:28.821 --> 02:11:31.190
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the onion version,</v>

2725
02:11:31.191 --> 02:11:32.570
<v Speaker 1>which did just happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2726
02:11:32.571 --> 02:11:35.570
<v Speaker 1>I think this was Microsoft where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>put out a,</v>

2727
02:11:35.660 --> 02:11:38.720
<v Speaker 1>what they were calling an Ai Bot on </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>

2728
02:11:38.900 --> 02:11:43.900
<v Speaker 1>There was a ai that just became a Hitler</v>
<v Speaker 1>loving sex spot because it was being </v>

2729
02:11:45.621 --> 02:11:48.830
<v Speaker 1>turned up by its interaction with people</v>
<v Speaker 1>trolling on twitter.</v>

2730
02:11:49.340 --> 02:11:54.340
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the guy who got arrested for</v>
<v Speaker 1>falling asleep inside his tesla when it </v>

2731
02:11:54.340 --> 02:11:54.560
<v Speaker 1>was on auto drive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2732
02:11:54.561 --> 02:11:54.990
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2733
02:11:55.790 --> 02:11:57.590
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got busted.</v>

2734
02:11:57.980 --> 02:11:59.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he got arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got busted though.</v>

2735
02:11:59.931 --> 02:12:04.931
<v Speaker 1>They have cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have camera photos of him rolling </v>

2736
02:12:04.931 --> 02:12:07.841
<v Speaker 1>through an intersection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely unconscious on his way to </v>

2737
02:12:07.841 --> 02:12:07.841
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this guy.</v>

2738
02:12:07.841 --> 02:12:07.841
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this.</v>

2739
02:12:09.210 --> 02:12:12.920
<v Speaker 1>The car is driving him and he's asleep </v>
<v Speaker 1>while it's on autopilot.</v>

2740
02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:15.530
<v Speaker 1>This is insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be okay.</v>

2741
02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:20.560
<v Speaker 2>Great moment to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm sure this is coming where a one </v>

2742
02:12:21.090 --> 02:12:26.090
<v Speaker 2>self driving cars become just obviously </v>
<v Speaker 2>the only truly safe alternative.</v>

2743
02:12:28.220 --> 02:12:31.100
<v Speaker 2>Then you'll be arrested for the opposite</v>
<v Speaker 2>violation.</v>

2744
02:12:31.101 --> 02:12:32.250
<v Speaker 2>You'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be arrested.</v>

2745
02:12:32.270 --> 02:12:37.270
<v Speaker 2>W if your hands are on the wheel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're driving a car that is this ape</v>

2746
02:12:38.060 --> 02:12:42.800
<v Speaker 2>piloted as opposed to a robot driven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's that say,</v>

2747
02:12:42.801 --> 02:12:44.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we got 30,000</v>

2748
02:12:44.961 --> 02:12:49.580
<v Speaker 2>people a year dying every year based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>ape driving.</v>

2749
02:12:50.240 --> 02:12:52.730
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the moment we crack that,</v>

2750
02:12:52.731 --> 02:12:55.050
<v Speaker 2>which we're very close to doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2751
02:12:56.160 --> 02:12:57.670
<v Speaker 2>it's just going to seem you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2752
02:12:57.671 --> 02:13:02.671
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got your old muscle cars or </v>

2753
02:13:02.671 --> 02:13:03.050
<v Speaker 2>whatever you're into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be like,</v>

2754
02:13:03.140 --> 02:13:05.030
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be the equivalent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2755
02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:06.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrate Tory gunfire.</v>

2756
02:13:07.410 --> 02:13:09.150
<v Speaker 2>You're going to reserve the right to </v>
<v Speaker 2>like at,</v>

2757
02:13:09.210 --> 02:13:09.890
<v Speaker 2>at your wedding</v>

2758
02:13:10.170 --> 02:13:15.170
<v Speaker 1>shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot your ar 15 and the air and not </v>

2759
02:13:15.170 --> 02:13:16.500
<v Speaker 1>care where the bullet lands going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to get a licensed,</v>

2760
02:13:16.501 --> 02:13:21.501
<v Speaker 1>operate them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to move out of the </v>

2761
02:13:21.501 --> 02:13:23.481
<v Speaker 1>big city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get to take them to the hills and </v>

2762
02:13:23.481 --> 02:13:23.481
<v Speaker 1>unload the amount of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2763
02:13:23.481 --> 02:13:27.820
<v Speaker 1>of the back of a truck driving for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very short distance as right monitor how</v>

2764
02:13:28.621 --> 02:13:31.080
<v Speaker 1>much a governor on them that they can go</v>
<v Speaker 1>five miles an hour.</v>

2765
02:13:31.260 --> 02:13:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2766
02:13:33.691 --> 02:13:36.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of safety for sure.</v>

2767
02:13:36.331 --> 02:13:39.240
<v Speaker 1>And then it seems to be the thing that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reoccurring theme,</v>

2768
02:13:39.540 --> 02:13:41.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You give up your privacy for safety.</v>

2769
02:13:42.300 --> 02:13:44.160
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you give up your,</v>

2770
02:13:45.270 --> 02:13:47.430
<v Speaker 1>your ability to drive a car wherever you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>

2771
02:13:47.431 --> 02:13:50.190
<v Speaker 1>whenever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however you want to give that up to give</v>

2772
02:13:50.191 --> 02:13:55.191
<v Speaker 1>that up for safety and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are really reluctant to give up </v>

2773
02:13:55.191 --> 02:13:59.190
<v Speaker 1>fun shit like lying and driving their </v>
<v Speaker 1>car fast.</v>

2774
02:13:59.340 --> 02:14:04.340
<v Speaker 1>Like those two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are going to have a hard time </v>

2775
02:14:04.340 --> 02:14:04.340
<v Speaker 1>with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like actually getting into the,</v>

2776
02:14:04.340 --> 02:14:09.080
<v Speaker 1>into their mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing their actual mind and being able </v>

2777
02:14:09.080 --> 02:14:09.750
<v Speaker 1>to do that so we can know without a </v>
<v Speaker 1>doubt whether or not someone's guilty or</v>

2778
02:14:09.751 --> 02:14:14.751
<v Speaker 1>innocent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my question to you is if you could </v>

2779
02:14:14.751 --> 02:14:15.660
<v Speaker 1>get inside someone's mind and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that really super.</v>

2780
02:14:16.100 --> 02:14:21.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm a suggestive guy that you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about earlier that just </v>

2781
02:14:21.100 --> 02:14:24.780
<v Speaker 1>confessed all the horrific demonic </v>
<v Speaker 1>possession stuff and eating babies.</v>

2782
02:14:24.990 --> 02:14:27.270
<v Speaker 1>What if it's like getting to that guy's </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind?</v>

2783
02:14:27.480 --> 02:14:28.500
<v Speaker 1>What if you can't tell?</v>

2784
02:14:30.070 --> 02:14:33.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the case that,</v>

2785
02:14:33.460 --> 02:14:38.460
<v Speaker 2>that worries me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is perhaps an inept segue to a </v>

2786
02:14:39.790 --> 02:14:41.050
<v Speaker 2>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

2787
02:14:41.051 --> 02:14:45.550
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're in people's minds.</v>

2788
02:14:45.940 --> 02:14:50.940
<v Speaker 2>You get someone talking long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know their minds.</v>

2789
02:14:51.431 --> 02:14:51.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2790
02:14:51.711 --> 02:14:56.711
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can only conceal what they're </v>

2791
02:14:56.711 --> 02:14:56.711
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A only so well right,</v>

2792
02:14:56.711 --> 02:14:58.960
<v Speaker 2>and you can because you're a super smart</v>
<v Speaker 2>wizard type.</v>

2793
02:14:59.310 --> 02:15:01.060
<v Speaker 2>Just Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about.</v>

2794
02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:06.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he's a mind reader,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the question is what will people </v>

2795
02:15:06.600 --> 02:15:06.600
<v Speaker 2>care?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2796
02:15:06.600 --> 02:15:07.180
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have,</v>

2797
02:15:07.181 --> 02:15:12.181
<v Speaker 2>we don't even need a lie detector.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have someone who's openly line </v>

2798
02:15:12.181 --> 02:15:12.181
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

2799
02:15:12.181 --> 02:15:14.380
<v Speaker 2>who just gets caught in lies again and </v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2800
02:15:14.410 --> 02:15:16.210
<v Speaker 2>you could see it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel it right,</v>

2801
02:15:16.211 --> 02:15:21.160
<v Speaker 2>but people don't seem to care in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>least in a political process.</v>

2802
02:15:21.190 --> 02:15:26.190
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm thinking in this case of trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you have someone who is in in some</v>

2803
02:15:26.621 --> 02:15:31.621
<v Speaker 2>cases line or just changing his mind in </v>
<v Speaker 2>such an incoherent way that it's the </v>

2804
02:15:35.351 --> 02:15:36.460
<v Speaker 2>functional equivalent of line.</v>

2805
02:15:36.470 --> 02:15:38.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean someone who becomes totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>unpredictable.</v>

2806
02:15:38.930 --> 02:15:43.930
<v Speaker 2>He has a stance that is a on Tuesday and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll be on Wednesday and when the </v>

2807
02:15:44.291 --> 02:15:47.500
<v Speaker 2>discrepancy is pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he tells her to go fuck yourself.</v>

2808
02:15:47.501 --> 02:15:48.090
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's just.</v>

2809
02:15:48.480 --> 02:15:52.570
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no accountability to his,</v>

2810
02:15:52.700 --> 02:15:55.930
<v Speaker 2>his own states of consciousness that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to be held to.</v>

2811
02:15:56.410 --> 02:15:59.740
<v Speaker 2>And the people who love him don't seem </v>
<v Speaker 2>to care.</v>

2812
02:15:59.741 --> 02:16:02.140
<v Speaker 2>They actually in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as I can tell,</v>

2813
02:16:02.550 --> 02:16:04.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't know so many of these people </v>
<v Speaker 2>personally,</v>

2814
02:16:04.751 --> 02:16:06.110
<v Speaker 2>but from based on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2815
02:16:06.790 --> 02:16:11.790
<v Speaker 2>social media and seeing the few articles</v>
<v Speaker 2>where someone has explained why they </v>

2816
02:16:11.790 --> 02:16:15.991
<v Speaker 2>love trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People view this as a kind of this sort </v>

2817
02:16:16.361 --> 02:16:21.130
<v Speaker 2>of this dishonesty what is on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my view,</v>

2818
02:16:21.190 --> 02:16:26.190
<v Speaker 2>both dishonesty and a kind of a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>theatrical hucksterism of person who's,</v>

2819
02:16:28.360 --> 02:16:31.480
<v Speaker 2>who's pretending to be many things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he probably isn't.</v>

2820
02:16:32.050 --> 02:16:34.870
<v Speaker 2>They see it as a new kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>authenticity,</v>

2821
02:16:35.050 --> 02:16:35.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this guy,</v>

2822
02:16:36.220 --> 02:16:38.420
<v Speaker 2>he's just letting it rip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't care what is,</v>

2823
02:16:38.560 --> 02:16:43.560
<v Speaker 2>what is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't care what your expectations </v>

2824
02:16:43.560 --> 02:16:45.901
<v Speaker 2>for coherence are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just going to tell you to fuck </v>

2825
02:16:45.901 --> 02:16:48.400
<v Speaker 2>yourself every which way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is the new way of being honest,</v>

2826
02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:51.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a new form of integrity.</v>

2827
02:16:52.420 --> 02:16:55.870
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's getting has been.</v>

2828
02:16:55.910 --> 02:16:58.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm someone who actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember on my own podcast,</v>

2829
02:16:58.361 --> 02:17:02.170
<v Speaker 2>I think I was talking to Paul Bloom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this gal psychologist,</v>

2830
02:17:02.171 --> 02:17:05.070
<v Speaker 2>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's great and we had taught.</v>

2831
02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:07.300
<v Speaker 2>We got into politics and this is at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least a year ago,</v>

2832
02:17:07.301 --> 02:17:12.301
<v Speaker 2>but at that point I said there's no way </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be talking about trump </v>

2833
02:17:12.301 --> 02:17:12.301
<v Speaker 2>and a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2834
02:17:12.301 --> 02:17:13.420
<v Speaker 2>this is kind of completely flame out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

2835
02:17:13.720 --> 02:17:16.000
<v Speaker 2>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't tend to make predictions,</v>

2836
02:17:16.001 --> 02:17:19.090
<v Speaker 2>but this was a clear moment that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember making a prediction,</v>

2837
02:17:19.091 --> 02:17:21.710
<v Speaker 2>which is now obviously false.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2838
02:17:21.850 --> 02:17:26.850
<v Speaker 2>but I just couldn't imagine it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this was this when people were </v>

2839
02:17:26.850 --> 02:17:27.960
<v Speaker 2>going to find this compelling enough to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

2840
02:17:28.090 --> 02:17:31.160
<v Speaker 2>for him to be on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the cusp of getting elected.</v>

2841
02:17:31.161 --> 02:17:33.490
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is terrifying.</v>

2842
02:17:33.550 --> 02:17:38.550
<v Speaker 2>Have you talked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you talked to this issue to death </v>

2843
02:17:38.550 --> 02:17:38.550
<v Speaker 2>on your podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or.</v>

2844
02:17:38.550 --> 02:17:38.550
<v Speaker 2>I guess we kind of have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2845
02:17:38.550 --> 02:17:40.180
<v Speaker 2>I think this is how everybody feels.</v>

2846
02:17:40.710 --> 02:17:44.250
<v Speaker 3>Everybody feels like you're supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be like with their person,</v>

2847
02:17:44.520 --> 02:17:49.520
<v Speaker 3>whether it's Bernie or whether it's for </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hillary or whether you're a trump </v>

2848
02:17:49.520 --> 02:17:49.890
<v Speaker 3>supporter or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you have to be all in.</v>

2849
02:17:50.070 --> 02:17:53.460
<v Speaker 3>But like if you look at the choices that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're given,</v>

2850
02:17:53.680 --> 02:17:58.680
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None of these kids really be described </v>

2851
02:17:58.680 --> 02:17:58.680
<v Speaker 3>as ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Hillary Clinton.</v>

2852
02:17:58.680 --> 02:18:00.510
<v Speaker 3>You could want a woman in the White </v>
<v Speaker 3>House and you want to,</v>

2853
02:18:00.860 --> 02:18:05.860
<v Speaker 3>you want to show everyone that a woman </v>
<v Speaker 3>can do that job just as well as a man </v>

2854
02:18:05.860 --> 02:18:09.121
<v Speaker 3>and she's got the most experienced and </v>
<v Speaker 3>she certainly has the most experience </v>

2855
02:18:09.121 --> 02:18:12.141
<v Speaker 3>dealing with foreign governments and she</v>
<v Speaker 3>certainly has the most experience in </v>

2856
02:18:12.141 --> 02:18:12.160
<v Speaker 3>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can make an easy a,</v>

2857
02:18:12.180 --> 02:18:15.340
<v Speaker 3>but she's also involved in to criminal </v>
<v Speaker 3>investigations.</v>

2858
02:18:15.341 --> 02:18:20.341
<v Speaker 3>She had an observer in her bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is squirrely stuff going on like,</v>

2859
02:18:22.010 --> 02:18:22.430
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's.</v>

2860
02:18:22.470 --> 02:18:24.510
<v Speaker 3>She's terrible in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>

2861
02:18:24.560 --> 02:18:26.960
<v Speaker 3>she was gay marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2862
02:18:27.160 --> 02:18:30.540
<v Speaker 3>2013 and then wouldn't admit the change </v>
<v Speaker 3>of mind either.</v>

2863
02:18:31.650 --> 02:18:34.560
<v Speaker 3>She's a politician,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's probably a brilliant woman,</v>

2864
02:18:34.590 --> 02:18:37.590
<v Speaker 3>but she's also set in her ways and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>politician,</v>

2865
02:18:37.630 --> 02:18:42.630
<v Speaker 3>a politician to the end and part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>being a politician is being a fucking </v>

2866
02:18:42.630 --> 02:18:46.551
<v Speaker 3>huckster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to be able to get those people </v>

2867
02:18:46.551 --> 02:18:49.221
<v Speaker 3>to see your side and the way you do that</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to talk like this.</v>

2868
02:18:50.550 --> 02:18:52.890
<v Speaker 3>You can't talk like a normal person </v>
<v Speaker 3>needs a speech coach.</v>

2869
02:18:53.460 --> 02:18:55.280
<v Speaker 3>They all do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's terrible to.</v>

2870
02:18:55.480 --> 02:18:57.870
<v Speaker 3>Trump's not even good at it and he kicks</v>
<v Speaker 3>their asses.</v>

2871
02:18:57.940 --> 02:18:58.590
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but who knows,</v>

2872
02:18:58.591 --> 02:19:03.591
<v Speaker 3>but her voice or she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she has a kind of to use the sexist </v>

2873
02:19:03.591 --> 02:19:03.810
<v Speaker 3>trope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She has a</v>

2874
02:19:04.120 --> 02:19:09.120
<v Speaker 2>real for when you were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you get her in front of a mic and </v>

2875
02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:10.110
<v Speaker 2>there's a crowd and she thinks she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking over the crowd,</v>

2876
02:19:10.111 --> 02:19:12.060
<v Speaker 2>which she doesn't have to do because </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's in front of a mic.</v>

2877
02:19:12.900 --> 02:19:15.360
<v Speaker 2>The sound you get is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2878
02:19:15.470 --> 02:19:20.470
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's yelling when she doesn't need to </v>

2879
02:19:20.470 --> 02:19:22.761
<v Speaker 2>yell at someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone has to teach her how to dial </v>

2880
02:19:22.761 --> 02:19:22.761
<v Speaker 2>that back.</v>

2881
02:19:22.761 --> 02:19:23.280
<v Speaker 3>What you just did is called </v>
<v Speaker 3>mansplaining.</v>

2882
02:19:25.270 --> 02:19:27.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm explaining to the men in her who </v>
<v Speaker 3>should,</v>

2883
02:19:27.440 --> 02:19:27.710
<v Speaker 3>who should</v>

2884
02:19:28.970 --> 02:19:31.610
<v Speaker 2>talk some sense into her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she is,</v>

2885
02:19:31.910 --> 02:19:33.500
<v Speaker 2>she's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a bad candidate,</v>

2886
02:19:33.590 --> 02:19:38.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no doubt that she's very smart </v>

2887
02:19:38.590 --> 02:19:41.411
<v Speaker 2>and she is well informed and she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>qualified and she is absolutely who I </v>

2888
02:19:41.411 --> 02:19:45.140
<v Speaker 2>will vote for given the choices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

2889
02:19:45.141 --> 02:19:47.900
<v Speaker 2>I totally understand people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>reservations with her.</v>

2890
02:19:47.901 --> 02:19:49.880
<v Speaker 2>She's a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's an opportunist.</v>

2891
02:19:49.910 --> 02:19:54.200
<v Speaker 2>She's just almost preternaturally and </v>
<v Speaker 2>authentic.</v>

2892
02:19:54.201 --> 02:19:55.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's just like,</v>

2893
02:19:55.640 --> 02:19:59.540
<v Speaker 2>she will just focus group every third </v>
<v Speaker 2>sentence and you feel that from her.</v>

2894
02:19:59.541 --> 02:20:00.470
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2895
02:20:01.220 --> 02:20:06.220
<v Speaker 2>and this is all true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yet I also believe that people who </v>

2896
02:20:06.220 --> 02:20:06.800
<v Speaker 2>say I've never met her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people who know her and have met her</v>

2897
02:20:06.801 --> 02:20:08.480
<v Speaker 2>say behind closed doors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2898
02:20:08.481 --> 02:20:12.200
<v Speaker 2>one on one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's incredibly impressive and great.</v>

2899
02:20:12.810 --> 02:20:17.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't translate into her </v>

2900
02:20:17.810 --> 02:20:17.810
<v Speaker 2>candidacy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She probably thinks she has to do it.</v>

2901
02:20:17.810 --> 02:20:18.750
<v Speaker 2>Old School,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2902
02:20:18.810 --> 02:20:20.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way she's doing it,</v>

2903
02:20:20.750 --> 02:20:21.530
<v Speaker 2>but she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2904
02:20:21.560 --> 02:20:22.610
<v Speaker 2>the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

2905
02:20:23.120 --> 02:20:26.150
<v Speaker 2>when you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's worked,</v>

2906
02:20:26.151 --> 02:20:26.690
<v Speaker 2>what worries me?</v>

2907
02:20:26.720 --> 02:20:29.360
<v Speaker 2>So I went on facebook the other day and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2908
02:20:29.390 --> 02:20:34.390
<v Speaker 2>I've said very little about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've made enough noise is of the </v>

2909
02:20:34.390 --> 02:20:35.180
<v Speaker 2>sort that I just made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people understand that I've,</v>

2910
02:20:35.330 --> 02:20:38.810
<v Speaker 2>that I'm for Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite all my reservations about her.</v>

2911
02:20:39.310 --> 02:20:44.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when I got on my own facebook page,</v>

2912
02:20:44.211 --> 02:20:49.211
<v Speaker 2>which you have to assume is filtered by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who are following me on </v>

2913
02:20:49.211 --> 02:20:49.670
<v Speaker 2>facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I already liked me in some sense,</v>

2914
02:20:50.330 --> 02:20:54.080
<v Speaker 2>just like a thousand comments of pure </v>
<v Speaker 2>pain.</v>

2915
02:20:54.081 --> 02:20:55.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one loves hillary.</v>

2916
02:20:55.431 --> 02:20:56.330
<v Speaker 2>No one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one said,</v>

2917
02:20:56.360 --> 02:20:58.460
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank God someone's someone smart is for</v>

2918
02:20:58.461 --> 02:20:59.590
<v Speaker 2>Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2919
02:21:00.020 --> 02:21:04.530
<v Speaker 2>it was all just Bernie people and trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>people flaming me for,</v>

2920
02:21:04.610 --> 02:21:09.610
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the most tepid possible endorsement </v>

2921
02:21:09.610 --> 02:21:09.610
<v Speaker 2>of Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All I said was,</v>

2922
02:21:10.190 --> 02:21:13.850
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand Clinton's a liar and she's,</v>

2923
02:21:13.900 --> 02:21:16.700
<v Speaker 2>and she's an opportunist and she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2924
02:21:17.330 --> 02:21:19.640
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I completely get your reservations about</v>

2925
02:21:19.641 --> 02:21:21.950
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least she's a grownup,</v>

2926
02:21:21.980 --> 02:21:22.280
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2927
02:21:22.310 --> 02:21:27.310
<v Speaker 2>And she's going to be the candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to be sanders for the </v>

2928
02:21:27.531 --> 02:21:32.531
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now is the moment to put your political </v>

2929
02:21:32.531 --> 02:21:33.710
<v Speaker 2>idealism behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a sanders person and recognize</v>

2930
02:21:33.711 --> 02:21:36.980
<v Speaker 2>that there's a vast difference between </v>
<v Speaker 2>Clinton and trump and no itch.</v>

2931
02:21:37.010 --> 02:21:38.390
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's not going to change the system,</v>

2932
02:21:38.391 --> 02:21:40.670
<v Speaker 2>but he's also not going to run </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization off a cliff.</v>

2933
02:21:40.740 --> 02:21:43.100
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't,</v>

2934
02:21:43.160 --> 02:21:45.800
<v Speaker 2>I forget how I said it on facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was just the most,</v>

2935
02:21:45.801 --> 02:21:50.801
<v Speaker 2>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really was a lesser of two evils </v>

2936
02:21:50.801 --> 02:21:51.020
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it just,</v>

2937
02:21:51.230 --> 02:21:52.010
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2938
02:21:52.100 --> 02:21:56.930
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing to see how energized and </v>
<v Speaker 2>passionate people are in defensive trump</v>

2939
02:21:57.020 --> 02:22:02.020
<v Speaker 2>and sanders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's almost none of that for </v>

2940
02:22:02.020 --> 02:22:04.901
<v Speaker 2>Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like people are just sheepishly </v>

2941
02:22:04.901 --> 02:22:06.080
<v Speaker 2>saying that they just divulging that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they will vote for Clinton,</v>

2942
02:22:07.070 --> 02:22:10.730
<v Speaker 2>but they are may.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe somewhere that I haven't noticed.</v>

2943
02:22:10.731 --> 02:22:12.920
<v Speaker 2>Someone loves absolutely loves Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just,</v>

2944
02:22:12.921 --> 02:22:17.921
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She does not have her defenders the way </v>

2945
02:22:17.921 --> 02:22:17.921
<v Speaker 2>these guys do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen the man enough to vote for</v>

2946
02:22:17.921 --> 02:22:19.100
<v Speaker 2>her campaign?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2947
02:22:19.160 --> 02:22:24.160
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's with like hipster dudes with </v>

2948
02:22:24.160 --> 02:22:24.160
<v Speaker 2>tattoos and beards that are going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>vote for Hillary.</v>

2949
02:22:24.320 --> 02:22:25.770
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope it's fake</v>

2950
02:22:26.250 --> 02:22:28.530
<v Speaker 1>because it's so brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope it's not real.</v>

2951
02:22:29.340 --> 02:22:32.810
<v Speaker 1>Is it fake?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it God?</v>

2952
02:22:34.200 --> 02:22:36.570
<v Speaker 1>It's so good though because it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>that fake.</v>

2953
02:22:37.470 --> 02:22:40.290
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you could almost see.</v>

2954
02:22:43.010 --> 02:22:46.440
<v Speaker 1>So wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is not for her,</v>

2955
02:22:46.441 --> 02:22:47.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>

2956
02:22:47.050 --> 02:22:47.910
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2957
02:22:47.911 --> 02:22:49.710
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not bad for just funny.</v>

2958
02:22:49.860 --> 02:22:54.300
<v Speaker 1>If someone would like make a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political ad,</v>

2959
02:22:54.530 --> 02:22:57.440
<v Speaker 1>you know that you have to be man enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>to vote for Hillary was like,</v>

2960
02:22:57.450 --> 02:22:59.220
<v Speaker 1>there's guys out there that would buy </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2961
02:22:59.820 --> 02:23:00.540
<v Speaker 1>They would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would,</v>

2962
02:23:02.190 --> 02:23:07.190
<v Speaker 1>they'd do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a scary time because it doesn't </v>

2963
02:23:07.190 --> 02:23:11.631
<v Speaker 1>seem like anybody that you would want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be president wants to be president and </v>

2964
02:23:11.631 --> 02:23:12.930
<v Speaker 1>so we're left with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

2965
02:23:12.931 --> 02:23:17.931
<v Speaker 1>what do you pick?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like as if we're going to play the </v>

2966
02:23:17.931 --> 02:23:18.390
<v Speaker 1>super bowl with three of the shittiest </v>
<v Speaker 1>teams we can find.</v>

2967
02:23:18.660 --> 02:23:21.000
<v Speaker 1>We're just going to go get some drunk </v>
<v Speaker 1>high school kids,</v>

2968
02:23:21.180 --> 02:23:26.180
<v Speaker 1>get some inmates with club feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is going to throw whoever we're </v>

2969
02:23:26.180 --> 02:23:27.480
<v Speaker 1>going to have the worst game ever and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this was what this game is.</v>

2970
02:23:27.481 --> 02:23:30.690
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not a game where you've got like</v>

2971
02:23:31.050 --> 02:23:35.370
<v Speaker 1>a John F Kennedy versus a Lyndon Johnson</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it's not.</v>

2972
02:23:35.420 --> 02:23:40.420
<v Speaker 1>It's not like like powerful characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's trump I guess is a really powerful </v>

2973
02:23:41.761 --> 02:23:46.761
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in more ways like a showman </v>

2974
02:23:46.761 --> 02:23:47.610
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what what he's doing.</v>

2975
02:23:47.940 --> 02:23:52.940
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's putting on a great show and he's </v>

2976
02:23:52.940 --> 02:23:56.050
<v Speaker 1>going to win probably because he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting on such a great show and people </v>

2977
02:23:56.050 --> 02:23:57.670
<v Speaker 1>like a great show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do think.</v>

2978
02:23:57.670 --> 02:23:57.860
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

2979
02:23:57.860 --> 02:24:02.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm now have among the people who think </v>
<v Speaker 2>something new witnessed were witnessing </v>

2980
02:24:03.141 --> 02:24:08.141
<v Speaker 2>something new with trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just the same old thing where </v>

2981
02:24:08.870 --> 02:24:13.870
<v Speaker 2>the process is so onerous that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>selecting for the kind of narcissist or </v>

2982
02:24:15.770 --> 02:24:19.250
<v Speaker 2>thick skin person who is willing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>submit to the process.</v>

2983
02:24:19.251 --> 02:24:24.251
<v Speaker 2>And then there are many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the good people just aren't </v>

2984
02:24:24.251 --> 02:24:24.251
<v Speaker 2>going to put up with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2985
02:24:24.251 --> 02:24:25.070
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's that too.</v>

2986
02:24:25.100 --> 02:24:27.350
<v Speaker 2>But there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2987
02:24:27.500 --> 02:24:28.950
<v Speaker 2>there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

2988
02:24:29.450 --> 02:24:34.450
<v Speaker 2>it's a moment among the electorate where</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2989
02:24:35.410 --> 02:24:37.070
<v Speaker 2>it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an antistatic.</v>

2990
02:24:37.090 --> 02:24:42.090
<v Speaker 2>There's an ant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's enough of an antiestablishment </v>

2991
02:24:42.090 --> 02:24:45.520
<v Speaker 2>mood and vote now is it happening with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with sanders to where people just want </v>

2992
02:24:47.601 --> 02:24:52.550
<v Speaker 2>to jam a stick in the wheel of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>system just to see what happens.</v>

2993
02:24:52.640 --> 02:24:53.150
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2994
02:24:53.210 --> 02:24:58.210
<v Speaker 2>this is the main gripe against Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 2>really is that she is politics as usual.</v>

2995
02:24:59.030 --> 02:25:00.930
<v Speaker 2>She's not going to change the system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2996
02:25:01.430 --> 02:25:06.430
<v Speaker 2>People want to change the system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not really thinking about </v>

2997
02:25:06.430 --> 02:25:07.070
<v Speaker 2>the implications of radically changing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the system.</v>

2998
02:25:07.580 --> 02:25:10.630
<v Speaker 2>And in the case of trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2999
02:25:11.540 --> 02:25:16.540
<v Speaker 2>I may hear or someone who is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was advertising his lack of </v>

3000
02:25:16.540 --> 02:25:20.000
<v Speaker 2>qualifications for the office in every </v>
<v Speaker 2>way that he can.</v>

3001
02:25:20.070 --> 02:25:20.730
<v Speaker 2>It's like he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3002
02:25:21.730 --> 02:25:23.670
<v Speaker 2>there is no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3003
02:25:23.680 --> 02:25:28.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even bothered by his racism or </v>

3004
02:25:28.680 --> 02:25:31.000
<v Speaker 2>his misogyny or his demagoguery or his </v>
<v Speaker 2>bully.</v>

3005
02:25:31.001 --> 02:25:36.001
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that I'm willing to to guess is </v>

3006
02:25:36.001 --> 02:25:39.721
<v Speaker 2>an act right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That he's decided that that's somehow </v>

3007
02:25:39.721 --> 02:25:40.780
<v Speaker 2>pandering his base and he's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in truth,</v>

3008
02:25:40.781 --> 02:25:42.430
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have a racist bone in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

3009
02:25:42.431 --> 02:25:45.390
<v Speaker 2>Say I'm willing to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to believe that amount.</v>

3010
02:25:45.420 --> 02:25:47.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why I would think that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>plausible,</v>

3011
02:25:47.741 --> 02:25:48.660
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3012
02:25:49.410 --> 02:25:49.690
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3013
02:25:50.190 --> 02:25:55.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a hunch that he's far more </v>

3014
02:25:55.190 --> 02:25:55.190
<v Speaker 2>liberal than he seems and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>pandering.</v>

3015
02:25:55.300 --> 02:25:57.410
<v Speaker 2>But the thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3016
02:25:57.411 --> 02:26:02.411
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't be true is there's no way he's </v>

3017
02:26:03.221 --> 02:26:08.221
<v Speaker 2>actually brilliant and well informed </v>
<v Speaker 2>about all the issues and is saying the </v>

3018
02:26:08.891 --> 02:26:13.891
<v Speaker 2>things he's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not pretending to be as uninformed </v>

3019
02:26:13.891 --> 02:26:16.300
<v Speaker 2>and as incoherent and as irresponsible </v>
<v Speaker 2>as he's seeming.</v>

3020
02:26:16.860 --> 02:26:21.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you wouldn't withhold </v>

3021
02:26:21.860 --> 02:26:21.860
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will make you a better leader.</v>

3022
02:26:21.860 --> 02:26:21.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

3023
02:26:21.860 --> 02:26:22.240
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3024
02:26:22.241 --> 02:26:22.720
<v Speaker 2>And it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3025
02:26:22.721 --> 02:26:25.060
<v Speaker 2>it's just the vacuous snus of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech.</v>

3026
02:26:25.061 --> 02:26:30.061
<v Speaker 2>It's like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll say that he'll say the same thing </v>

3027
02:26:30.061 --> 02:26:32.320
<v Speaker 2>three times in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was meaningless the first time,</v>

3028
02:26:32.530 --> 02:26:33.280
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll say,</v>

3029
02:26:33.490 --> 02:26:35.290
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be very,</v>

3030
02:26:35.291 --> 02:26:36.520
<v Speaker 2>very amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trust me,</v>

3031
02:26:36.521 --> 02:26:38.200
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be so amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he does.</v>

3032
02:26:38.230 --> 02:26:43.230
<v Speaker 2>He does this with everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the transcripts of his </v>

3033
02:26:43.230 --> 02:26:46.201
<v Speaker 2>speeches and the fact that he can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has never met so far as I've seen.</v>

3034
02:26:48.880 --> 02:26:53.880
<v Speaker 2>He has never once strung together a </v>
<v Speaker 2>string of sentences that was even </v>

3035
02:26:56.381 --> 02:26:57.220
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3036
02:26:57.221 --> 02:26:58.140
<v Speaker 2>But he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

3037
02:26:58.310 --> 02:26:59.800
<v Speaker 2>he's never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>

3038
02:27:00.640 --> 02:27:03.160
<v Speaker 2>there's never a moment where I read or I</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

3039
02:27:03.190 --> 02:27:08.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy is smarter and better informed </v>

3040
02:27:08.190 --> 02:27:11.730
<v Speaker 2>than I realized at that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never comes where I keep expecting to </v>

3041
02:27:11.730 --> 02:27:11.730
<v Speaker 2>see that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3042
02:27:12.640 --> 02:27:17.640
<v Speaker 2>and it's a little bit like my head is </v>
<v Speaker 2>this image of like imagine you have an </v>

3043
02:27:17.640 --> 02:27:17.640
<v Speaker 2>urn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3044
02:27:17.640 --> 02:27:20.940
<v Speaker 2>And you just keep pulling things out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and all you pull out of it as junk,</v>

3045
02:27:20.950 --> 02:27:21.300
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3046
02:27:21.310 --> 02:27:21.900
<v Speaker 2>you pull,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3047
02:27:21.940 --> 02:27:25.000
<v Speaker 2>chicken bones and broken marbles and gum</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3048
02:27:25.480 --> 02:27:29.530
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still possible that you,</v>

3049
02:27:29.650 --> 02:27:31.510
<v Speaker 2>that if you root around in that earn </v>
<v Speaker 2>long enough,</v>

3050
02:27:31.511 --> 02:27:33.030
<v Speaker 2>you're going to find the hope diamond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3051
02:27:33.031 --> 02:27:38.031
<v Speaker 2>in each round that you pull something </v>
<v Speaker 2>out that really has no logical </v>

3052
02:27:38.031 --> 02:27:40.150
<v Speaker 2>implication for the next thing you might</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull out of the earn,</v>

3053
02:27:40.810 --> 02:27:43.750
<v Speaker 2>but mines aren't like that when I see </v>
<v Speaker 2>what this guy says,</v>

3054
02:27:43.751 --> 02:27:47.290
<v Speaker 2>he does not say anything that a well </v>
<v Speaker 2>informed,</v>

3055
02:27:47.291 --> 02:27:49.120
<v Speaker 2>intelligent person would say.</v>

3056
02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:49.780
<v Speaker 2>And it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3057
02:27:49.800 --> 02:27:51.410
<v Speaker 2>and ideas are connected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3058
02:27:51.411 --> 02:27:53.050
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3059
02:27:54.640 --> 02:27:56.400
<v Speaker 2>you can't fake this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't fake,</v>

3060
02:27:56.450 --> 02:28:01.210
<v Speaker 2>you can't fake being this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this uninformed and you can't fake being</v>

3061
02:28:01.240 --> 02:28:03.700
<v Speaker 2>really well informed and he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3062
02:28:03.701 --> 02:28:06.460
<v Speaker 2>we just look at one policy that he wants</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

3063
02:28:06.490 --> 02:28:07.590
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the um,</v>

3064
02:28:08.610 --> 02:28:09.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3065
02:28:09.061 --> 02:28:12.610
<v Speaker 2>the rounding up of illegal aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right around 11 million illegal aliens.</v>

3066
02:28:12.670 --> 02:28:14.620
<v Speaker 2>Now this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this gets stated as,</v>

3067
02:28:14.621 --> 02:28:19.621
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to round them up and send </v>

3068
02:28:19.621 --> 02:28:21.061
<v Speaker 2>them back to Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what worries me is no one seems to </v>

3069
02:28:21.141 --> 02:28:26.141
<v Speaker 2>care about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you just look at the implications of </v>

3070
02:28:26.141 --> 02:28:28.010
<v Speaker 2>doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has this one policy.</v>

3071
02:28:28.011 --> 02:28:32.210
<v Speaker 2>Claim alone is so impractical and </v>
<v Speaker 2>unethical.</v>

3072
02:28:32.360 --> 02:28:35.450
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are we talking about here?</v>

3073
02:28:35.451 --> 02:28:39.290
<v Speaker 2>You're talking like your gardener,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your housekeeper or the person who works</v>

3074
02:28:39.291 --> 02:28:42.020
<v Speaker 2>at the carwash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The person who picks the vegetables that</v>

3075
02:28:42.021 --> 02:28:47.021
<v Speaker 2>you buy in the market is going to get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>knock on the door in the middle of the </v>

3076
02:28:47.021 --> 02:28:49.760
<v Speaker 2>night by the Gestapo and get sent back </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

3077
02:28:49.820 --> 02:28:52.620
<v Speaker 2>The vast majority of these people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

3078
02:28:52.630 --> 02:28:57.630
<v Speaker 2>are law abiding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are just working at jobs that </v>

3079
02:28:57.630 --> 02:29:00.730
<v Speaker 2>Americans by and large don't want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And many of them have kids who were </v>

3080
02:29:01.281 --> 02:29:02.340
<v Speaker 2>American citizens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3081
02:29:02.341 --> 02:29:07.341
<v Speaker 2>And somebody to say someone's got kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>under the age of 10 who are American </v>

3082
02:29:07.341 --> 02:29:10.511
<v Speaker 2>citizens and what you're going to send </v>
<v Speaker 2>that person back to Mexico and you're </v>

3083
02:29:10.511 --> 02:29:11.930
<v Speaker 2>going to do this by the hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands and millions.</v>

3084
02:29:12.470 --> 02:29:17.470
<v Speaker 2>It's just that one point alone held in </v>
<v Speaker 2>isolation from all of the other things </v>

3085
02:29:19.401 --> 02:29:24.401
<v Speaker 2>he said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The crazy things like climate change is </v>

3086
02:29:24.401 --> 02:29:25.460
<v Speaker 2>a hoax concocted by the Chinese to </v>
<v Speaker 2>destroy our manufacturing base.</v>

3087
02:29:25.461 --> 02:29:26.490
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3088
02:29:26.510 --> 02:29:26.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3089
02:29:26.860 --> 02:29:28.330
<v Speaker 2>the fact that he likes Putin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3090
02:29:28.340 --> 02:29:31.400
<v Speaker 2>everything else he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>write this one policy.</v>

3091
02:29:31.401 --> 02:29:35.150
<v Speaker 2>Claim alone should be enough to </v>
<v Speaker 2>disqualify a person's candidacy.</v>

3092
02:29:35.151 --> 02:29:38.210
<v Speaker 2>It's so crazy with the moment you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at it,</v>

3093
02:29:38.810 --> 02:29:41.150
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yet no one seems to care.</v>

3094
02:29:41.150 --> 02:29:42.160
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

3095
02:29:42.170 --> 02:29:45.680
<v Speaker 2>it's just more energizing to the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who already like it.</v>

3096
02:29:46.130 --> 02:29:48.170
<v Speaker 2>I know that he said that he wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>build a wall,</v>

3097
02:29:48.171 --> 02:29:51.830
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't know that said that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to get rid of the illegal aliens,</v>

3098
02:29:51.831 --> 02:29:54.980
<v Speaker 2>round them up and around them up and do </v>
<v Speaker 2>one with them,</v>

3099
02:29:55.650 --> 02:29:58.550
<v Speaker 2>send them back to their country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so crazy.</v>

3100
02:29:58.760 --> 02:30:00.830
<v Speaker 2>It's such a crazy idea and it's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>brutal.</v>

3101
02:30:01.010 --> 02:30:02.360
<v Speaker 2>The idea that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3102
02:30:02.630 --> 02:30:04.400
<v Speaker 2>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a sub human thing.</v>

3103
02:30:04.440 --> 02:30:09.440
<v Speaker 2>The only reason why people would come to</v>
<v Speaker 2>America is because they felt they felt </v>

3104
02:30:09.440 --> 02:30:10.400
<v Speaker 2>like it would make their life better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people take a big risk.</v>

3105
02:30:10.401 --> 02:30:12.380
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not an easy way to do it.</v>

3106
02:30:12.381 --> 02:30:17.381
<v Speaker 2>If you're poor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have any qualifications for </v>

3107
02:30:17.381 --> 02:30:20.621
<v Speaker 2>any unusual job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're trying to get across to </v>

3108
02:30:20.621 --> 02:30:23.621
<v Speaker 2>Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everybody who does it does it </v>

3109
02:30:23.621 --> 02:30:23.621
<v Speaker 2>because they want to improve their life.</v>

3110
02:30:23.621 --> 02:30:27.220
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the idea that one group of people </v>

3111
02:30:27.220 --> 02:30:29.081
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be able to do it in one group </v>
<v Speaker 2>should just because they were born on </v>

3112
02:30:29.081 --> 02:30:31.721
<v Speaker 2>the right side of some strange line that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is only a couple hundred years old,</v>

3113
02:30:32.160 --> 02:30:32.990
<v Speaker 2>but I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3114
02:30:32.991 --> 02:30:36.590
<v Speaker 2>I'll go further in meeting him in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle.</v>

3115
02:30:36.591 --> 02:30:37.070
<v Speaker 2>Whereas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3116
02:30:37.120 --> 02:30:39.380
<v Speaker 2>so I think we should be able to defend </v>
<v Speaker 2>our borders.</v>

3117
02:30:39.410 --> 02:30:40.520
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it is.</v>

3118
02:30:40.910 --> 02:30:45.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a good argument for having </v>
<v Speaker 2>a porous border that we can't figure out</v>

3119
02:30:46.041 --> 02:30:48.170
<v Speaker 2>how to defend and we don't know who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming into the country.</v>

3120
02:30:48.190 --> 02:30:48.470
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3121
02:30:48.650 --> 02:30:53.650
<v Speaker 2>so I think building the wall is almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly a stupid idea among his many </v>

3122
02:30:53.650 --> 02:30:58.151
<v Speaker 2>stupid ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it would be great to know </v>

3123
02:30:58.151 --> 02:30:59.140
<v Speaker 2>who's coming into the country and have </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

3124
02:30:59.360 --> 02:31:02.270
<v Speaker 2>a purely legal process by which that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

3125
02:31:02.271 --> 02:31:04.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately that's got to be the goal,</v>

3126
02:31:04.131 --> 02:31:05.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3127
02:31:05.570 --> 02:31:09.470
<v Speaker 2>and we are in perfectly doing that.</v>

3128
02:31:09.530 --> 02:31:14.530
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't have an argument for open </v>

3129
02:31:14.530 --> 02:31:17.711
<v Speaker 2>borders or porous borders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the question is what do you do with </v>

3130
02:31:17.711 --> 02:31:21.770
<v Speaker 2>11 or 12 million people who are already </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing jobs we want them to do that help </v>

3131
02:31:22.201 --> 02:31:27.201
<v Speaker 2>our society and the vast majority of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them are law abiding people who as you </v>

3132
02:31:27.451 --> 02:31:29.550
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or just trying to have better lives,</v>

3133
02:31:30.720 --> 02:31:35.720
<v Speaker 2>the idea that you're going to break up </v>
<v Speaker 2>families and send people back by the </v>

3134
02:31:35.720 --> 02:31:38.430
<v Speaker 2>millions and the idea that you're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to devote your law enforcement resources</v>

3135
02:31:38.431 --> 02:31:42.750
<v Speaker 2>to doing this when you have real </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorism and real crime to,</v>

3136
02:31:43.020 --> 02:31:46.350
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to deal with is just pure insanity.</v>

3137
02:31:46.530 --> 02:31:47.520
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3138
02:31:48.330 --> 02:31:53.330
<v Speaker 2>and also totally unethical and yet he </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't get any points docked for this </v>

3139
02:31:55.740 --> 02:31:56.550
<v Speaker 2>aspiration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3140
02:31:56.551 --> 02:32:01.551
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the things around which </v>

3141
02:32:01.551 --> 02:32:03.531
<v Speaker 2>people are rallying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the climate change thing is also </v>

3142
02:32:03.531 --> 02:32:03.640
<v Speaker 2>insane and dangerous.</v>

3143
02:32:03.750 --> 02:32:05.610
<v Speaker 2>He was a birther,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3144
02:32:05.700 --> 02:32:06.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3145
02:32:06.360 --> 02:32:11.360
<v Speaker 2>He was one of the original birthers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was saying that Obama's birth </v>

3146
02:32:11.360 --> 02:32:12.600
<v Speaker 2>certificate was bullshit and he was born</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Kenya,</v>

3147
02:32:12.601 --> 02:32:13.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't he one of those guys?</v>

3148
02:32:14.220 --> 02:32:15.150
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

3149
02:32:15.210 --> 02:32:16.110
<v Speaker 2>he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3150
02:32:16.980 --> 02:32:18.430
<v Speaker 2>I would love it if funding that for </v>
<v Speaker 2>awhile.</v>

3151
02:32:18.450 --> 02:32:23.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to if he got in the office </v>

3152
02:32:23.450 --> 02:32:23.450
<v Speaker 2>and just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen folks,</v>

3153
02:32:23.450 --> 02:32:26.490
<v Speaker 2>I am nothing like this person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pretended to be to win the presidency.</v>

3154
02:32:26.520 --> 02:32:30.270
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to show you that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>be manipulated and get it together.</v>

3155
02:32:30.850 --> 02:32:35.850
<v Speaker 2>Then peaches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>punk to all going to hire some people </v>

3156
02:32:35.850 --> 02:32:36.840
<v Speaker 2>who actually know how to run things and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll see.</v>

3157
02:32:36.841 --> 02:32:38.470
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3158
02:32:38.510 --> 02:32:41.400
<v Speaker 2>the smart people who are voting for him </v>
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>

3159
02:32:41.580 --> 02:32:43.270
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think an actual,</v>

3160
02:32:43.590 --> 02:32:48.590
<v Speaker 2>a crazy position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they think that he is just pandering</v>

3161
02:32:49.410 --> 02:32:53.790
<v Speaker 2>to the idiots who he needs to pander to </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get into office.</v>

3162
02:32:53.790 --> 02:32:58.790
<v Speaker 2>So He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not disavowing the white </v>

3163
02:32:58.790 --> 02:33:02.361
<v Speaker 2>supremacists votes with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Alacrity that you would if you were </v>

3164
02:33:02.361 --> 02:33:04.590
<v Speaker 2>a decent human being and you found out </v>
<v Speaker 2>that David Dukes who supported you,</v>

3165
02:33:05.040 --> 02:33:06.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3166
02:33:06.270 --> 02:33:07.710
<v Speaker 2>because he needs to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>

3167
02:33:07.800 --> 02:33:12.800
<v Speaker 2>he needs those votes and he knows that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that most of the people in his base </v>

3168
02:33:12.800 --> 02:33:15.870
<v Speaker 2>aren't going to care and he can just </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of move on in the news cycle.</v>

3169
02:33:16.890 --> 02:33:21.090
<v Speaker 2>And he's doing this on all these issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where he looked,</v>

3170
02:33:21.380 --> 02:33:25.360
<v Speaker 2>where smart people see that he looks </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a buffoon and,</v>

3171
02:33:25.380 --> 02:33:27.560
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they are treating him as a,</v>

3172
02:33:27.570 --> 02:33:32.570
<v Speaker 2>the people who don't like him or </v>
<v Speaker 2>treating him as a comic figure who he </v>

3173
02:33:32.570 --> 02:33:34.050
<v Speaker 2>can't really believe that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not really,</v>

3174
02:33:34.051 --> 02:33:35.990
<v Speaker 2>he's too sophisticated to really believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff.</v>

3175
02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.020
<v Speaker 2>So He's just pandering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3176
02:33:38.760 --> 02:33:43.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one is that people aren't seeing if </v>

3177
02:33:43.760 --> 02:33:46.881
<v Speaker 2>that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just how unethical and weird that is </v>

3178
02:33:46.881 --> 02:33:46.881
<v Speaker 2>right here.</v>

3179
02:33:46.881 --> 02:33:48.700
<v Speaker 2>The guy has no compunction about lying </v>
<v Speaker 2>and demonizing people.</v>

3180
02:33:48.701 --> 02:33:49.000
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3181
02:33:49.010 --> 02:33:54.010
<v Speaker 2>let's say he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say he thinks that that Clinton </v>

3182
02:33:54.010 --> 02:33:55.930
<v Speaker 2>really isn't guilty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Bill Clinton isn't really guilty of,</v>

3183
02:33:55.940 --> 02:33:57.390
<v Speaker 2>of a rape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3184
02:33:57.391 --> 02:33:58.890
<v Speaker 2>And now he's calling him a rapist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now,</v>

3185
02:33:58.891 --> 02:34:02.850
<v Speaker 2>at the time he was saying he wasn't a </v>
<v Speaker 2>rapist and he's just being defamed.</v>

3186
02:34:02.851 --> 02:34:04.160
<v Speaker 2>And this is outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was taking,</v>

3187
02:34:04.161 --> 02:34:05.780
<v Speaker 2>he was taking the side of a friend who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3188
02:34:05.850 --> 02:34:09.390
<v Speaker 2>he invited to his wedding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now he's,</v>

3189
02:34:09.570 --> 02:34:11.160
<v Speaker 2>he's calling him a rapist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3190
02:34:11.161 --> 02:34:16.161
<v Speaker 2>A sexual Predator who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who've harmed women's rights more than </v>

3191
02:34:16.161 --> 02:34:16.190
<v Speaker 2>anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so,</v>

3192
02:34:16.200 --> 02:34:17.070
<v Speaker 2>which is true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3193
02:34:17.110 --> 02:34:22.110
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no version of the truth here </v>

3194
02:34:22.110 --> 02:34:24.190
<v Speaker 2>that makes trump look at all acceptable </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a person.</v>

3195
02:34:24.191 --> 02:34:29.191
<v Speaker 2>It's like either he knew he was a rapist</v>
<v Speaker 2>and was defending him because he was </v>

3196
02:34:29.591 --> 02:34:31.870
<v Speaker 2>just cozying up to power at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3197
02:34:31.900 --> 02:34:35.530
<v Speaker 2>Didn't care that he's a rapist or now </v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3198
02:34:35.830 --> 02:34:40.830
<v Speaker 2>he knows he still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's still the guy who thinks he wasn't </v>

3199
02:34:40.830 --> 02:34:43.891
<v Speaker 2>a rapist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now he's just for purely </v>

3200
02:34:43.891 --> 02:34:43.891
<v Speaker 2>opportunistic reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

3201
02:34:43.891 --> 02:34:47.880
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's willing to call a guy a rapist who </v>

3202
02:34:47.880 --> 02:34:47.880
<v Speaker 2>he knows isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3203
02:34:47.880 --> 02:34:48.340
<v Speaker 2>they're both horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3204
02:34:48.880 --> 02:34:53.880
<v Speaker 2>And it's not like there's new evidence </v>
<v Speaker 2>has come forward in the intervening </v>

3205
02:34:53.880 --> 02:34:55.450
<v Speaker 2>years that would have changed his mind </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what happened in,</v>

3206
02:34:55.470 --> 02:34:58.930
<v Speaker 2>in Clinton's presidency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's um,</v>

3207
02:34:59.850 --> 02:35:04.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think people think that he's got </v>

3208
02:35:04.850 --> 02:35:08.531
<v Speaker 2>to be much more sophisticated than he is</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that if he got into office,</v>

3209
02:35:09.430 --> 02:35:12.910
<v Speaker 2>he would just be a totally sober and </v>
<v Speaker 2>presidential person.</v>

3210
02:35:13.570 --> 02:35:18.570
<v Speaker 2>There's just no reason to believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that if he thinks climate change </v>

3211
02:35:18.570 --> 02:35:20.470
<v Speaker 2>is a hoax and that we should pull out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Paris accord,</v>

3212
02:35:20.471 --> 02:35:24.340
<v Speaker 2>then we should ramp up coal production </v>
<v Speaker 2>and when to bring back the coal jobs.</v>

3213
02:35:24.341 --> 02:35:25.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what he's saying,</v>

3214
02:35:25.361 --> 02:35:30.361
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no reason to think he doesn't </v>

3215
02:35:30.361 --> 02:35:30.361
<v Speaker 2>believe this at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3216
02:35:31.150 --> 02:35:35.440
<v Speaker 2>that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a disastrous thing for a president</v>

3217
02:35:35.441 --> 02:35:38.020
<v Speaker 2>to think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only,</v>

3218
02:35:38.021 --> 02:35:38.590
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3219
02:35:38.900 --> 02:35:43.900
<v Speaker 3>fascinating versions of this that I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>been hearing from people that I respect </v>

3220
02:35:43.900 --> 02:35:47.350
<v Speaker 3>are that the idea that he is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3221
02:35:48.110 --> 02:35:50.750
<v Speaker 3>the political version of the asteroid </v>
<v Speaker 3>that killed the dinosaurs.</v>

3222
02:35:50.990 --> 02:35:55.990
<v Speaker 3>Like he's going to come down and smash </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and it's going to be so chaotic that </v>

3223
02:35:55.990 --> 02:35:59.771
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be forced to reform the</v>
<v Speaker 3>system and people are going to respond </v>

3224
02:35:59.771 --> 02:36:03.011
<v Speaker 3>in turn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the way people responding against </v>

3225
02:36:03.011 --> 02:36:03.011
<v Speaker 3>factory farming and more people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>going Vegan,</v>

3226
02:36:03.011 --> 02:36:07.481
<v Speaker 3>like that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to see it and they get to </v>

3227
02:36:07.481 --> 02:36:09.221
<v Speaker 3>respond in turn that has such a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like he's going to toss the </v>

3228
02:36:09.490 --> 02:36:11.990
<v Speaker 3>applecart up in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just going to fuck this whole goofy</v>

3229
02:36:11.991 --> 02:36:16.991
<v Speaker 3>system up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we'll be able to rebuild after </v>

3230
02:36:16.991 --> 02:36:19.511
<v Speaker 3>trump has dismantled all the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the different special interest </v>

3231
02:36:19.511 --> 02:36:22.931
<v Speaker 3>groups and lobbyists and all the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we really would like to get out of </v>

3232
02:36:22.931 --> 02:36:22.931
<v Speaker 3>the system.</v>

3233
02:36:22.931 --> 02:36:22.980
<v Speaker 3>We really don't like the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The.</v>

3234
02:36:22.981 --> 02:36:27.981
<v Speaker 3>The fact that they're such insane </v>
<v Speaker 3>amounts of influence that big </v>

3235
02:36:27.981 --> 02:36:29.840
<v Speaker 3>corporations and lobbyists have had on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way.</v>

3236
02:36:29.841 --> 02:36:32.780
<v Speaker 3>Laws get passed that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This might be the way to do it.</v>

3237
02:36:32.990 --> 02:36:35.330
<v Speaker 3>You have some wild man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's fired.</v>

3238
02:36:35.331 --> 02:36:37.580
<v Speaker 3>You have fired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have fire Jetson.</v>

3239
02:36:37.910 --> 02:36:39.860
<v Speaker 3>It's like a character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's coming in.</v>

3240
02:36:39.861 --> 02:36:43.370
<v Speaker 3>His hair's plastic is all fired up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a billionaire.</v>

3241
02:36:43.371 --> 02:36:44.870
<v Speaker 3>He made all his own money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of.</v>

3242
02:36:44.930 --> 02:36:47.360
<v Speaker 3>Dad gave him some money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he turned it into a lot of money.</v>

3243
02:36:47.590 --> 02:36:48.870
<v Speaker 3>Point being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't need anybody to.</v>

3244
02:36:48.880 --> 02:36:51.170
<v Speaker 3>My truth is he's probably lying about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of money has to.</v>

3245
02:36:51.190 --> 02:36:54.410
<v Speaker 3>Is He is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's a baller for sure though,</v>

3246
02:36:54.470 --> 02:36:55.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>At the very least,</v>

3247
02:36:55.850 --> 02:36:58.460
<v Speaker 3>he's got to be worth some cash.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3248
02:36:58.490 --> 02:37:03.490
<v Speaker 3>I made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be a big difference between </v>

3249
02:37:03.490 --> 02:37:03.490
<v Speaker 3>what he's claiming and what is in fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>

3250
02:37:03.490 --> 02:37:05.360
<v Speaker 2>But he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a many pieces here.</v>

3251
02:37:05.380 --> 02:37:08.210
<v Speaker 2>When people assume that because he's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful businessman,</v>

3252
02:37:08.570 --> 02:37:10.450
<v Speaker 2>he must understand the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3253
02:37:10.460 --> 02:37:12.770
<v Speaker 2>Which is no necessary connection there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3254
02:37:13.940 --> 02:37:17.570
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of rich who are totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>confused about economics.</v>

3255
02:37:18.200 --> 02:37:19.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

3256
02:37:19.300 --> 02:37:24.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most economists don't have a lot of </v>

3257
02:37:24.300 --> 02:37:24.300
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's no real connection there.</v>

3258
02:37:24.300 --> 02:37:24.300
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

3259
02:37:25.820 --> 02:37:26.570
<v Speaker 5>the uh,</v>

3260
02:37:28.130 --> 02:37:33.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what you're describing is a kind of </v>

3261
02:37:33.130 --> 02:37:33.130
<v Speaker 2>just random,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3262
02:37:33.130 --> 02:37:33.130
<v Speaker 2>like you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just,</v>

3263
02:37:33.190 --> 02:37:36.760
<v Speaker 2>let's just smash the window and then see</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens.</v>

3264
02:37:36.761 --> 02:37:41.761
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm going to light a fire to this </v>

3265
02:37:41.761 --> 02:37:41.761
<v Speaker 2>place and see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

3266
02:37:41.950 --> 02:37:42.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3267
02:37:45.450 --> 02:37:50.450
<v Speaker 2>it almost any process by which you would</v>
<v Speaker 2>change the system is more intelligent </v>

3268
02:37:50.450 --> 02:37:50.640
<v Speaker 2>than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3269
02:37:50.700 --> 02:37:53.370
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's also not value in how much harm</v>

3270
02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:57.140
<v Speaker 2>one bad president could do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3271
02:37:57.210 --> 02:37:57.840
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

3272
02:37:58.140 --> 02:38:01.110
<v Speaker 2>I think even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't tested this,</v>

3273
02:38:01.111 --> 02:38:06.111
<v Speaker 2>but I'm imagining that even trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>supporters would answer this question </v>

3274
02:38:06.111 --> 02:38:09.591
<v Speaker 2>the way I would hope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like if I had a crystal ball </v>

3275
02:38:09.591 --> 02:38:14.390
<v Speaker 2>that could tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell you who's going to be </v>

3276
02:38:14.390 --> 02:38:16.391
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it tells you how it works out for </v>

3277
02:38:16.391 --> 02:38:16.391
<v Speaker 2>the next president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like if I,</v>

3278
02:38:16.391 --> 02:38:19.470
<v Speaker 2>if I look in the crystal ball and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>says the next president of United States</v>

3279
02:38:20.010 --> 02:38:21.610
<v Speaker 2>is a disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3280
02:38:21.611 --> 02:38:23.400
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the worst president we've ever</v>

3281
02:38:23.401 --> 02:38:25.320
<v Speaker 2>had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just think of,</v>

3282
02:38:25.350 --> 02:38:29.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just just failures of governance and,</v>

3283
02:38:30.270 --> 02:38:35.270
<v Speaker 2>and the toxic influence of narcissism </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Hubris that comes along just like </v>

3284
02:38:35.820 --> 02:38:37.050
<v Speaker 2>once every thousand years.</v>

3285
02:38:37.050 --> 02:38:37.500
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

3286
02:38:37.560 --> 02:38:40.740
<v Speaker 2>just disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

3287
02:38:40.741 --> 02:38:43.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you're a trump supporter,</v>

3288
02:38:43.470 --> 02:38:47.210
<v Speaker 2>which candidate that was like only trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

3289
02:38:47.310 --> 02:38:51.690
<v Speaker 2>is likely to screw things up that badly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a Clinton is going to,</v>

3290
02:38:51.720 --> 02:38:54.930
<v Speaker 2>is going to be almost perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 2>predictable.</v>

3291
02:38:55.320 --> 02:38:57.300
<v Speaker 2>She's going to be a politician.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's going to,</v>

3292
02:38:57.330 --> 02:39:00.350
<v Speaker 2>she's going to be basically centrist on </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the,</v>

3293
02:39:00.351 --> 02:39:02.910
<v Speaker 2>on foreign policy and domestic policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3294
02:39:02.911 --> 02:39:05.550
<v Speaker 2>she's going to be liberal on social </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues.</v>

3295
02:39:06.050 --> 02:39:11.050
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she is not going to try to dismantle </v>

3296
02:39:12.001 --> 02:39:17.001
<v Speaker 2>NATO and to get into a war with North </v>
<v Speaker 2>Korea or get into an alliance with Putin</v>

3297
02:39:18.691 --> 02:39:21.690
<v Speaker 2>or image.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's not going to do something insane.</v>

3298
02:39:22.030 --> 02:39:25.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so alliance with Putin.</v>

3299
02:39:25.510 --> 02:39:25.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3300
02:39:26.200 --> 02:39:29.180
<v Speaker 2>he said basically only favorable things </v>
<v Speaker 2>about Putin.</v>

3301
02:39:29.280 --> 02:39:30.900
<v Speaker 2>They're homeless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're tight.</v>

3302
02:39:32.120 --> 02:39:33.350
<v Speaker 2>So she get get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3303
02:39:33.480 --> 02:39:38.480
<v Speaker 2>hopefully we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll see pictures with both of them on </v>

3304
02:39:38.480 --> 02:39:40.290
<v Speaker 2>horseback,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shirtless and a golf shirt on.</v>

3305
02:39:40.800 --> 02:39:45.800
<v Speaker 2>He'll probably keep my shirt on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see them as being the shirtless </v>

3306
02:39:45.800 --> 02:39:45.800
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

3307
02:39:46.320 --> 02:39:46.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3308
02:39:49.280 --> 02:39:54.280
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you just look at the landscape </v>

3309
02:39:54.280 --> 02:39:56.370
<v Speaker 2>between Bernie and Hillary in him and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3310
02:39:56.700 --> 02:40:01.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me it looks like the last gasps of a </v>

3311
02:40:01.700 --> 02:40:04.731
<v Speaker 2>dying system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's representative government </v>

3312
02:40:04.731 --> 02:40:08.451
<v Speaker 2>system for a lot of people are saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>that things like that,</v>

3313
02:40:09.270 --> 02:40:14.270
<v Speaker 2>but they're not hearing just nihilistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is if.</v>

3314
02:40:15.661 --> 02:40:16.500
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

3315
02:40:16.530 --> 02:40:17.010
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3316
02:40:17.011 --> 02:40:17.380
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we,</v>

3317
02:40:17.400 --> 02:40:19.590
<v Speaker 2>there's so much stuff we have to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3318
02:40:20.160 --> 02:40:23.510
<v Speaker 2>And there's so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the only tool to get it right is,</v>

3319
02:40:23.670 --> 02:40:28.670
<v Speaker 2>is having your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your mind actually understand what's </v>

3320
02:40:28.670 --> 02:40:33.591
<v Speaker 2>going on in the world and how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulate the world in the direction </v>

3321
02:40:33.591 --> 02:40:36.530
<v Speaker 2>you want it to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to understand like what,</v>

3322
02:40:36.540 --> 02:40:41.540
<v Speaker 2>whether or not climate change is true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your beliefs about it have to be </v>

3323
02:40:41.540 --> 02:40:43.430
<v Speaker 2>representative of that truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3324
02:40:43.450 --> 02:40:44.640
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if let's say,</v>

3325
02:40:44.740 --> 02:40:45.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say it's,</v>

3326
02:40:46.500 --> 02:40:47.900
<v Speaker 2>let's say I'm mistaken and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3327
02:40:47.950 --> 02:40:52.950
<v Speaker 2>there is no human caused climate change </v>
<v Speaker 2>is not a problem and every moment spent </v>

3328
02:40:53.730 --> 02:40:55.360
<v Speaker 2>thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worrying about it,</v>

3329
02:40:55.950 --> 02:40:58.830
<v Speaker 2>correcting for it is just a waste of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

3330
02:40:58.830 --> 02:41:00.670
<v Speaker 2>That's just throwing out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3331
02:41:00.760 --> 02:41:02.070
<v Speaker 2>the wealth of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3332
02:41:03.330 --> 02:41:05.490
<v Speaker 2>That would be a terrible thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3333
02:41:05.491 --> 02:41:10.491
<v Speaker 2>So it really matters who's right about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and the fact that we have a </v>

3334
02:41:10.491 --> 02:41:12.660
<v Speaker 2>president or a candidate who is coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>in saying,</v>

3335
02:41:13.280 --> 02:41:14.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is all bullshit,</v>

3336
02:41:14.910 --> 02:41:15.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

3337
02:41:15.660 --> 02:41:19.770
<v Speaker 2>in defiance of all of the science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3338
02:41:19.980 --> 02:41:20.820
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3339
02:41:21.710 --> 02:41:22.410
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's true,</v>

3340
02:41:22.440 --> 02:41:24.570
<v Speaker 2>but it's on every other part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

3341
02:41:24.571 --> 02:41:29.571
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't know anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you he doesn't know the </v>

3342
02:41:29.571 --> 02:41:33.471
<v Speaker 2>difference between Sunni and Shia Islam </v>
<v Speaker 2>or which countries are Sunni </v>

3343
02:41:33.471 --> 02:41:34.980
<v Speaker 2>predominantly in which are Shia </v>
<v Speaker 2>predominantly.</v>

3344
02:41:35.010 --> 02:41:37.200
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he's going to do,</v>

3345
02:41:37.201 --> 02:41:39.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know when he's gonna Cram for </v>
<v Speaker 2>this final exam,</v>

3346
02:41:39.091 --> 02:41:41.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure before one of those debates </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to get,</v>

3347
02:41:41.620 --> 02:41:46.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's gonna sit down with him and </v>

3348
02:41:46.620 --> 02:41:46.620
<v Speaker 2>give him some bullet points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got to have in his head,</v>

3349
02:41:46.620 --> 02:41:48.960
<v Speaker 2>but his head is just not in this game.</v>

3350
02:41:48.960 --> 02:41:52.860
<v Speaker 2>It's never been in this game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's obvious from everything he says and</v>

3351
02:41:53.490 --> 02:41:55.740
<v Speaker 2>that's what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something you can't say about Clinton.</v>

3352
02:41:55.860 --> 02:41:57.720
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For all of her flaws as a person,</v>

3353
02:41:57.721 --> 02:41:59.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't care how much you hate her as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

3354
02:42:00.180 --> 02:42:05.180
<v Speaker 2>She understands what's going on in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world and that that difference is so </v>

3355
02:42:05.180 --> 02:42:09.531
<v Speaker 2>enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forget about all the other character </v>

3356
02:42:09.531 --> 02:42:11.580
<v Speaker 2>flaws of this guy who is just obviously </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to.</v>

3357
02:42:11.900 --> 02:42:15.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but are we attached to much to this idea</v>

3358
02:42:15.691 --> 02:42:19.170
<v Speaker 2>of one person being the figurehead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure it out.</v>

3359
02:42:19.180 --> 02:42:22.470
<v Speaker 2>Someone has to be the decider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we all woke up today,</v>

3360
02:42:22.500 --> 02:42:25.410
<v Speaker 2>if everybody woke up and there was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>no government,</v>

3361
02:42:25.620 --> 02:42:27.720
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All just what happened?</v>

3362
02:42:27.750 --> 02:42:32.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we've got to figure out how to run </v>

3363
02:42:32.750 --> 02:42:32.750
<v Speaker 2>this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3364
02:42:32.750 --> 02:42:32.750
<v Speaker 2>we had no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no previous understanding of government.</v>

3365
02:42:32.750 --> 02:42:37.521
<v Speaker 2>Would you think anybody would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need one dude to just run this whole </v>

3366
02:42:37.521 --> 02:42:40.500
<v Speaker 2>giant continent filled with 300 million </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are most likely if we woke up</v>

3367
02:42:40.501 --> 02:42:42.690
<v Speaker 2>and we had technology like we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

3368
02:42:42.840 --> 02:42:47.840
<v Speaker 2>we have the ability to communicate like </v>
<v Speaker 2>we have today with social media and </v>

3369
02:42:47.840 --> 02:42:47.840
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3370
02:42:47.840 --> 02:42:51.800
<v Speaker 2>We would probably say we need to like </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure this out amongst each other and </v>

3371
02:42:51.800 --> 02:42:55.551
<v Speaker 2>find the people that have the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>qualified for each one of these </v>

3372
02:42:55.551 --> 02:42:56.580
<v Speaker 2>positions and we'll start running our </v>
<v Speaker 2>government that way.</v>

3373
02:42:56.610 --> 02:42:58.740
<v Speaker 2>Well that that's what we're attempting </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do,</v>

3374
02:42:58.770 --> 02:43:03.770
<v Speaker 2>but it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I totally agree with you that it is </v>

3375
02:43:03.770 --> 02:43:05.250
<v Speaker 2>astonishing that out of a nation of 300 </v>
<v Speaker 2>million people,</v>

3376
02:43:05.340 --> 02:43:10.340
<v Speaker 2>these are the choices you would think </v>
<v Speaker 2>you would think would be starting from </v>

3377
02:43:10.340 --> 02:43:10.340
<v Speaker 2>your base.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That you know,</v>

3378
02:43:10.360 --> 02:43:12.070
<v Speaker 2>your zero set point of just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3379
02:43:12.071 --> 02:43:15.280
<v Speaker 2>now we're going to reboot civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3380
02:43:16.210 --> 02:43:20.020
<v Speaker 2>you would think that if you had this </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of process,</v>

3381
02:43:20.800 --> 02:43:23.810
<v Speaker 2>each candidate would be more impressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>than the next man.</v>

3382
02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.050
<v Speaker 2>You'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe each,</v>

3383
02:43:26.080 --> 02:43:29.850
<v Speaker 2>each person who came to the podium like </v>
<v Speaker 2>James,</v>

3384
02:43:29.851 --> 02:43:30.760
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like,</v>

3385
02:43:30.761 --> 02:43:32.320
<v Speaker 2>it'd be like the dunk contest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3386
02:43:32.321 --> 02:43:33.880
<v Speaker 2>for the NBA and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

3387
02:43:34.120 --> 02:43:39.120
<v Speaker 2>I could just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you thought you saw the best dunk </v>

3388
02:43:39.120 --> 02:43:39.120
<v Speaker 2>in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3389
02:43:39.120 --> 02:43:41.140
<v Speaker 2>the next guy comes along and it would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3390
02:43:41.320 --> 02:43:43.540
<v Speaker 2>It would be that on every topic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3391
02:43:43.600 --> 02:43:47.110
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like you'd be talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>science of climate change.</v>

3392
02:43:47.111 --> 02:43:51.260
<v Speaker 2>You'd be talking about the actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>dynamics of the war on terror,</v>

3393
02:43:51.810 --> 02:43:56.410
<v Speaker 2>so topics that seem to have no </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship where you would have to be.</v>

3394
02:43:56.740 --> 02:43:59.470
<v Speaker 2>You'd be amazed at anyone could be an </v>
<v Speaker 2>expert in all of them.</v>

3395
02:43:59.770 --> 02:44:03.280
<v Speaker 2>You would find someone who is an expert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a functional expert in all of them.</v>

3396
02:44:03.470 --> 02:44:04.420
<v Speaker 2>Agility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>winter dude.</v>

3397
02:44:04.480 --> 02:44:04.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3398
02:44:05.020 --> 02:44:10.020
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but someone who also ethically wise who </v>

3399
02:44:10.020 --> 02:44:11.270
<v Speaker 2>wasn't just wasn't obviously an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3400
02:44:11.950 --> 02:44:14.730
<v Speaker 2>and who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3401
02:44:15.320 --> 02:44:16.660
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who had a,</v>

3402
02:44:17.210 --> 02:44:22.210
<v Speaker 2>a mature relationship to change in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>or her mind.</v>

3403
02:44:23.110 --> 02:44:23.470
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3404
02:44:23.471 --> 02:44:25.960
<v Speaker 2>like the whole bit about flip flopping </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3405
02:44:26.320 --> 02:44:27.580
<v Speaker 2>and not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3406
02:44:28.200 --> 02:44:33.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being like someone who could honestly </v>

3407
02:44:33.200 --> 02:44:33.210
<v Speaker 2>represent changes of mind in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

3408
02:44:33.580 --> 02:44:35.680
<v Speaker 2>across a political career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3409
02:44:35.930 --> 02:44:37.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's nowhere written.</v>

3410
02:44:37.661 --> 02:44:41.590
<v Speaker 2>That is a good thing to believe today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you believe 20 years ago.</v>

3411
02:44:41.590 --> 02:44:43.240
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they do that on every topic,</v>

3412
02:44:43.241 --> 02:44:45.790
<v Speaker 2>it means basically you haven't been in </v>
<v Speaker 2>dialogue with the world,</v>

3413
02:44:46.840 --> 02:44:51.840
<v Speaker 2>but there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so taboo to change your mind that </v>

3414
02:44:51.840 --> 02:44:53.770
<v Speaker 2>either you have to lie about it or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to pretend it was a,</v>

3415
02:44:53.780 --> 02:44:56.590
<v Speaker 2>it was always that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or um,</v>

3416
02:44:57.100 --> 02:44:58.300
<v Speaker 2>it's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3417
02:44:58.770 --> 02:45:01.360
<v Speaker 2>the system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the system is,</v>

3418
02:45:02.260 --> 02:45:05.290
<v Speaker 2>is broken in that respect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but given the choices,</v>

3419
02:45:05.700 --> 02:45:10.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you have a choice between </v>

3420
02:45:10.700 --> 02:45:12.391
<v Speaker 2>someone who is for all her flaws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>been in the game for long enough to be </v>

3421
02:45:14.231 --> 02:45:18.580
<v Speaker 2>really well informed and capable of </v>
<v Speaker 2>compromise and capable of,</v>

3422
02:45:19.110 --> 02:45:20.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just,</v>

3423
02:45:20.590 --> 02:45:25.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just breaking the entire machine and you</v>

3424
02:45:28.991 --> 02:45:31.990
<v Speaker 2>have someone who's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could just got stepped off the set of</v>

3425
02:45:31.991 --> 02:45:36.340
<v Speaker 2>his reality TV show and then the lied </v>
<v Speaker 2>about everything and,</v>

3426
02:45:36.350 --> 02:45:39.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and elbowed his way onto your television</v>

3427
02:45:39.791 --> 02:45:42.200
<v Speaker 2>set and never left because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3428
02:45:42.450 --> 02:45:45.760
<v Speaker 2>CNN couldn't figure out how to give the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mic to someone else.</v>

3429
02:45:46.200 --> 02:45:48.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3430
02:45:48.041 --> 02:45:49.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>

3431
02:45:49.480 --> 02:45:51.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a product of attention because they</v>

3432
02:45:51.791 --> 02:45:54.490
<v Speaker 2>realize that there's the heated race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3433
02:45:54.491 --> 02:45:59.491
<v Speaker 2>The heated race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy was really famous and in a </v>

3434
02:45:59.491 --> 02:46:01.920
<v Speaker 2>heated race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy would say some crazy stuff and </v>

3435
02:46:01.920 --> 02:46:02.140
<v Speaker 2>so they would tune into him so everybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>had to do an intro.</v>

3436
02:46:02.141 --> 02:46:07.141
<v Speaker 2>So because of him saying crazy stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he accelerated the amount they were </v>

3437
02:46:07.141 --> 02:46:10.561
<v Speaker 2>talking about them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're constantly talking about him </v>

3438
02:46:10.561 --> 02:46:10.561
<v Speaker 2>and barely talking other people and.</v>

3439
02:46:10.820 --> 02:46:11.510
<v Speaker 1>But he's created</v>

3440
02:46:11.710 --> 02:46:16.710
<v Speaker 2>warm hole in our political process now </v>
<v Speaker 2>where there's nothing so crazy that </v>

3441
02:46:16.710 --> 02:46:21.251
<v Speaker 2>could disqualify him among the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who like him to so he can just keep it </v>

3442
02:46:21.251 --> 02:46:22.800
<v Speaker 2>just like nuclear bombs of craziness </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3443
02:46:22.801 --> 02:46:26.950
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the press can't ignore that the,</v>

3444
02:46:26.951 --> 02:46:28.350
<v Speaker 2>every time they think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3445
02:46:28.351 --> 02:46:31.350
<v Speaker 2>this is the crazy thing he said that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to harm his candidacy,</v>

3446
02:46:31.351 --> 02:46:33.870
<v Speaker 2>so let's shine a light on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just helps him,</v>

3447
02:46:34.640 --> 02:46:35.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could,</v>

3448
02:46:35.460 --> 02:46:36.510
<v Speaker 2>he could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could,</v>

3449
02:46:36.540 --> 02:46:37.710
<v Speaker 2>he could get on twitter right now and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

3450
02:46:37.711 --> 02:46:38.690
<v Speaker 2>you know who I'd like to fuck,</v>

3451
02:46:38.710 --> 02:46:43.710
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to fuck Nikki Minaj and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it would work for him.</v>

3452
02:46:45.850 --> 02:46:50.850
<v Speaker 1>It was work for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would see a use a tweet storm of a </v>

3453
02:46:50.850 --> 02:46:54.061
<v Speaker 1>billion people who say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to fuck Nikki Minaj to go get </v>

3454
02:46:54.061 --> 02:46:55.300
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's insanity.</v>

3455
02:46:55.330 --> 02:46:59.470
<v Speaker 1>That's where we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in a sense,</v>

3456
02:46:59.500 --> 02:47:03.070
<v Speaker 1>if w w we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do admit this is a fucked up system.</v>

3457
02:47:03.071 --> 02:47:08.071
<v Speaker 1>It's not ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should definitely be reworked and </v>

3458
02:47:08.071 --> 02:47:08.560
<v Speaker 1>it's so hard to rework.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't the best way to rework it?</v>

3459
02:47:08.830 --> 02:47:12.010
<v Speaker 1>A trump asteroid just slams right into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the White House.</v>

3460
02:47:12.310 --> 02:47:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blows the whole thing sky high.</v>

3461
02:47:15.280 --> 02:47:18.400
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what terrible things have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>

3462
02:47:18.401 --> 02:47:21.990
<v Speaker 1>but maybe that would be enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is we have those,</v>

3463
02:47:22.020 --> 02:47:22.480
<v Speaker 1>those assets,</v>

3464
02:47:22.500 --> 02:47:27.500
<v Speaker 2>troy's are coming anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you look at like nine slash 11 </v>

3465
02:47:27.500 --> 02:47:27.500
<v Speaker 2>was an asteroid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3466
02:47:27.500 --> 02:47:29.750
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or a superbug that,</v>

3467
02:47:29.920 --> 02:47:34.920
<v Speaker 2>that becomes a pandemic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that these are things that are coming </v>

3468
02:47:35.190 --> 02:47:40.070
<v Speaker 2>and we need people who are in touch </v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

3469
02:47:40.420 --> 02:47:42.720
<v Speaker 2>with reality to deal with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3470
02:47:42.721 --> 02:47:46.260
<v Speaker 2>So like the moment someone advertises </v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

3471
02:47:46.290 --> 02:47:49.230
<v Speaker 2>not only their ignorance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that they don't care,</v>

3472
02:47:49.470 --> 02:47:52.350
<v Speaker 2>that they're ignorant and they do that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this again and again,</v>

3473
02:47:52.351 --> 02:47:57.351
<v Speaker 2>they keep doubling down that person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you put that person at the </v>

3474
02:47:57.351 --> 02:48:01.371
<v Speaker 2>helm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you have done is basically put </v>

3475
02:48:01.371 --> 02:48:02.030
<v Speaker 2>chaos at the hill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3476
02:48:02.040 --> 02:48:02.400
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3477
02:48:02.450 --> 02:48:07.450
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this person's going to believe whatever </v>

3478
02:48:07.450 --> 02:48:09.171
<v Speaker 2>he believes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regardless of the information coming in </v>

3479
02:48:09.171 --> 02:48:10.470
<v Speaker 2>and regardless of the consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just.</v>

3480
02:48:10.471 --> 02:48:11.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3481
02:48:11.560 --> 02:48:14.070
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's worse than having no one in charge.</v>

3482
02:48:14.071 --> 02:48:14.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you've,</v>

3483
02:48:15.020 --> 02:48:20.020
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've put the power in this person's </v>

3484
02:48:20.020 --> 02:48:20.020
<v Speaker 2>hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3485
02:48:20.020 --> 02:48:20.020
<v Speaker 2>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this person is,</v>

3486
02:48:20.020 --> 02:48:24.801
<v Speaker 2>everything has to go through this node </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the network that is just like an </v>

3487
02:48:24.931 --> 02:48:27.090
<v Speaker 2>information scrambling device.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3488
02:48:27.091 --> 02:48:27.860
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know how Matt,</v>

3489
02:48:27.870 --> 02:48:29.760
<v Speaker 2>no matter how good the information is </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming in,</v>

3490
02:48:29.970 --> 02:48:33.360
<v Speaker 2>you have everything that you've got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottleneck here which just screws up the</v>

3491
02:48:33.361 --> 02:48:34.050
<v Speaker 2>signal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3492
02:48:34.480 --> 02:48:36.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you're doing.</v>

3493
02:48:36.901 --> 02:48:37.830
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

3494
02:48:37.860 --> 02:48:41.670
<v Speaker 2>if you're hiring someone like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I'm,</v>

3495
02:48:42.150 --> 02:48:42.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3496
02:48:42.511 --> 02:48:43.880
<v Speaker 2>in the best case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3497
02:48:44.790 --> 02:48:47.670
<v Speaker 2>what you stated earlier would in fact be</v>
<v Speaker 2>true,</v>

3498
02:48:47.671 --> 02:48:47.880
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3499
02:48:47.881 --> 02:48:52.881
<v Speaker 2>he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll get into the oval office and even </v>

3500
02:48:52.881 --> 02:48:52.881
<v Speaker 2>he will be scared about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the prospect that he is now</v>

3501
02:48:52.881 --> 02:48:54.520
<v Speaker 1>running the better part of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

3502
02:48:55.180 --> 02:48:57.520
<v Speaker 1>And he will hire the best people,</v>

3503
02:48:58.640 --> 02:49:03.080
<v Speaker 2>some semblance of the best people he can</v>
<v Speaker 2>get access to and say,</v>

3504
02:49:03.100 --> 02:49:06.860
<v Speaker 2>tell me how to not screw this up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that will be a.</v>

3505
02:49:07.620 --> 02:49:12.620
<v Speaker 2>and then it'll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it'll essentially be business as </v>

3506
02:49:12.620 --> 02:49:12.620
<v Speaker 2>usual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3507
02:49:12.620 --> 02:49:13.710
<v Speaker 2>Insofar as you've hired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best people will be people.</v>

3508
02:49:13.770 --> 02:49:16.620
<v Speaker 2>People who are deeply in this game </v>
<v Speaker 2>already,</v>

3509
02:49:16.621 --> 02:49:17.420
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3510
02:49:17.430 --> 02:49:19.970
<v Speaker 2>he'll defer to the generals when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes time to make</v>

3511
02:49:20.050 --> 02:49:25.050
<v Speaker 3>wore the being real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really pragmatic about how they pick </v>

3512
02:49:25.050 --> 02:49:27.250
<v Speaker 3>politicians and how they push certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and decided I had to push others.</v>

3513
02:49:27.670 --> 02:49:32.020
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that something like trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely changes how they move forward</v>

3514
02:49:32.140 --> 02:49:36.220
<v Speaker 3>now they realized that this can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like now that you see that people are so</v>

3515
02:49:36.221 --> 02:49:40.030
<v Speaker 3>goofy were so wwe eat out that you can </v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean this is,</v>

3517
02:49:41.530 --> 02:49:42.700
<v Speaker 3>this is where we're at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>

3518
02:49:42.960 --> 02:49:45.910
<v Speaker 3>we've got a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told them the wall just got 10 foot.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Like how could you say that?</v>

3521
02:49:50.120 --> 02:49:52.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once they realize that that's possible.</v>

3522
02:49:52.620 --> 02:49:55.710
<v Speaker 3>How long before you get like some </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivational speaker type dudes?</v>

3523
02:49:56.570 --> 02:49:57.960
<v Speaker 3>Long before they started jumping in </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

3524
02:49:58.230 --> 02:50:00.490
<v Speaker 3>Tony Robbins had presence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what we have.</v>

3525
02:50:00.491 --> 02:50:01.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

3526
02:50:01.820 --> 02:50:06.820
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is way worse than Tony Robbins for </v>

3527
02:50:06.820 --> 02:50:06.820
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3528
02:50:06.820 --> 02:50:06.820
<v Speaker 3>Way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Way more positive dude.</v>

3529
02:50:06.820 --> 02:50:06.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3530
02:50:06.820 --> 02:50:08.390
<v Speaker 3>But I'd vote for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3531
02:50:08.400 --> 02:50:09.540
<v Speaker 3>Tony Robbins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>positive guy.</v>

3532
02:50:09.541 --> 02:50:10.340
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not what I mean.</v>

3533
02:50:10.341 --> 02:50:15.341
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that sort of ability to excite </v>

3534
02:50:15.341 --> 02:50:18.000
<v Speaker 3>people get like one of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>motivational speaker dudes,</v>

3535
02:50:18.420 --> 02:50:23.420
<v Speaker 3>those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas a lot of yoga pants and he's </v>

3536
02:50:23.420 --> 02:50:25.250
<v Speaker 3>gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's gonna be the next president is </v>

3537
02:50:25.250 --> 02:50:25.740
<v Speaker 3>going to get us in shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Getting be a reality show.</v>

3538
02:50:25.910 --> 02:50:29.160
<v Speaker 3>America is a reality show where there </v>
<v Speaker 3>were awesome.</v>

3539
02:50:29.500 --> 02:50:30.210
<v Speaker 3>We're the best.</v>

3540
02:50:32.840 --> 02:50:34.290
<v Speaker 2>Did you see this press conference he </v>
<v Speaker 2>held?</v>

3541
02:50:34.620 --> 02:50:36.790
<v Speaker 2>I think it was yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not know.</v>

3542
02:50:36.850 --> 02:50:40.590
<v Speaker 2>There was a very funny moment where </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was one journalist.</v>

3543
02:50:40.770 --> 02:50:43.840
<v Speaker 2>I didn't recognize who it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who gets hooked.</v>

3544
02:50:44.010 --> 02:50:49.010
<v Speaker 2>So trump was being very combative with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the press pool and he was,</v>

3545
02:50:49.080 --> 02:50:50.280
<v Speaker 2>he was basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3546
02:50:50.281 --> 02:50:52.110
<v Speaker 2>shouting them down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not answering any of the questions.</v>

3547
02:50:52.380 --> 02:50:54.450
<v Speaker 2>And one journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a gas said,</v>

3548
02:50:54.900 --> 02:50:57.960
<v Speaker 2>is this what is going to be like when </v>
<v Speaker 2>your president and is this,</v>

3549
02:50:57.961 --> 02:51:02.961
<v Speaker 2>how is this what is going to be like to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be in the White House press corps and </v>

3550
02:51:02.961 --> 02:51:03.440
<v Speaker 2>deal with you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3551
02:51:03.500 --> 02:51:04.230
<v Speaker 2>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

3552
02:51:04.340 --> 02:51:08.060
<v Speaker 2>this is exactly what's gonna be like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3553
02:51:08.061 --> 02:51:13.061
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could just see that like the </v>

3554
02:51:13.061 --> 02:51:13.061
<v Speaker 2>journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they,</v>

3555
02:51:13.061 --> 02:51:13.061
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they turn the camera on the room,</v>

3556
02:51:13.061 --> 02:51:17.151
<v Speaker 2>a journalists and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are astonished by what is happening</v>

3557
02:51:19.021 --> 02:51:24.021
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they don't know they're </v>

3558
02:51:24.021 --> 02:51:24.021
<v Speaker 2>participating in this process and in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

3559
02:51:24.021 --> 02:51:24.021
<v Speaker 2>in some sense they've created this </v>
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>

3560
02:51:24.360 --> 02:51:25.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

3561
02:51:25.541 --> 02:51:25.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3562
02:51:27.610 --> 02:51:28.390
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not all of you.</v>

3563
02:51:28.750 --> 02:51:32.350
<v Speaker 6>Many of you are enough of us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is this what you do?</v>

3564
02:51:32.440 --> 02:51:37.440
<v Speaker 6>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is this what it's going to be like </v>

3565
02:51:37.440 --> 02:51:37.440
<v Speaker 6>covering you if your president?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3566
02:51:37.440 --> 02:51:41.330
<v Speaker 6>let,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let me just have this kind of take </v>

3567
02:51:41.330 --> 02:51:41.330
<v Speaker 6>charge in the restroom.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3568
02:51:41.330 --> 02:51:41.330
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it is going to be like this David.</v>

3569
02:51:41.330 --> 02:51:45.510
<v Speaker 6>If the press writes false stores like </v>
<v Speaker 6>they did with this because you know,</v>

3570
02:51:45.760 --> 02:51:48.070
<v Speaker 6>half of you are amazed that I raised all</v>
<v Speaker 6>this money.</v>

3571
02:51:48.550 --> 02:51:53.550
<v Speaker 6>If the press writes false start as like </v>
<v Speaker 6>they did where I want it to keep a low </v>

3572
02:51:53.550 --> 02:51:54.910
<v Speaker 6>profile,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't want the credit for raising all</v>

3573
02:51:54.911 --> 02:51:59.911
<v Speaker 6>this money for the vets.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wasn't looking for the credit and by </v>

3574
02:51:59.911 --> 02:52:02.581
<v Speaker 6>the way more money is coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wasn't looking for the credit but I </v>

3575
02:52:02.581 --> 02:52:06.511
<v Speaker 6>had no choice but to do this because the</v>
<v Speaker 6>press was saying I didn't raise any </v>

3576
02:52:06.511 --> 02:52:06.511
<v Speaker 6>money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Them not only that,</v>

3577
02:52:06.511 --> 02:52:09.010
<v Speaker 6>I raise it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>much of it was given a long time ago and</v>

3578
02:52:09.011 --> 02:52:11.380
<v Speaker 6>there is a vetting process and I think </v>
<v Speaker 6>you understand that,</v>

3579
02:52:11.680 --> 02:52:16.680
<v Speaker 6>but when I raised almost $6,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>in probably in the end were raised more </v>

3580
02:52:16.680 --> 02:52:18.280
<v Speaker 6>than six because more is going to come </v>
<v Speaker 6>in and is coming in.</v>

3581
02:52:18.670 --> 02:52:21.400
<v Speaker 6>But when I raised five point 6 million,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as of today,</v>

3582
02:52:21.580 --> 02:52:23.530
<v Speaker 6>Maura's coming in and I.</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

3583
02:52:23.531 --> 02:52:28.531
<v Speaker 6>and this is going to phenomenal groups </v>
<v Speaker 6>and have many of these people vetting </v>

3584
02:52:28.540 --> 02:52:29.980
<v Speaker 6>the people that are getting the money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And</v>

3585
02:52:30.270 --> 02:52:35.270
<v Speaker 2>you played the moment I was referring to</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably live here.</v>

3586
02:52:36.031 --> 02:52:41.031
<v Speaker 2>Is it a case where he's probably almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly line about his history of </v>

3587
02:52:41.031 --> 02:52:44.490
<v Speaker 2>giving to veterans affairs and says he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gave money very recently after people</v>

3588
02:52:44.491 --> 02:52:49.491
<v Speaker 2>started fishing around to see if he </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually had given the money that he </v>

3589
02:52:49.491 --> 02:52:49.770
<v Speaker 2>claimed to have given to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to veterans.</v>

3590
02:52:50.490 --> 02:52:52.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

3591
02:52:52.900 --> 02:52:54.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is,</v>

3592
02:52:55.770 --> 02:52:58.910
<v Speaker 2>what's difficult about this is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the pr,</v>

3593
02:52:58.980 --> 02:53:03.980
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are the presses highly imperfect </v>

3594
02:53:03.980 --> 02:53:07.281
<v Speaker 2>and there and also partisan and there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are false stories and there are </v>

3595
02:53:07.281 --> 02:53:09.840
<v Speaker 2>exaggerations and they screw people </v>
<v Speaker 2>over.</v>

3596
02:53:09.841 --> 02:53:14.841
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there are reasons to not trust the </v>

3597
02:53:17.761 --> 02:53:22.761
<v Speaker 2>press from time to time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in this case you have a,</v>

3598
02:53:25.770 --> 02:53:30.770
<v Speaker 2>someone who there is no amount of fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>checking and discuss information of his </v>

3599
02:53:31.161 --> 02:53:36.161
<v Speaker 2>statements that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that forces him to ever acknowledge </v>

3600
02:53:36.161 --> 02:53:40.580
<v Speaker 2>anything that he's done wrong and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the lack of acknowledgement that he </v>

3601
02:53:40.580 --> 02:53:42.630
<v Speaker 2>pays no price for it among,</v>
<v Speaker 2>among the people who like him.</v>

3602
02:53:43.080 --> 02:53:46.770
<v Speaker 2>And so the press is powerless and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then.</v>

3603
02:53:46.800 --> 02:53:49.200
<v Speaker 2>But the net result of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a press conference like this,</v>

3604
02:53:49.201 --> 02:53:54.201
<v Speaker 2>if you were a trump's follower is he </v>
<v Speaker 2>just showed how biased and and petty the</v>

3605
02:53:58.141 --> 02:54:03.141
<v Speaker 2>press pool is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the press do need to just be beaten </v>

3606
02:54:03.141 --> 02:54:06.321
<v Speaker 2>up by a strong man who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's not going to stand for their </v>

3607
02:54:06.321 --> 02:54:06.321
<v Speaker 2>bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a,</v>

3608
02:54:06.360 --> 02:54:07.260
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3609
02:54:07.660 --> 02:54:11.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's unbecoming at the very </v>
<v Speaker 2>least,</v>

3610
02:54:11.520 --> 02:54:14.970
<v Speaker 2>that kind of communication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of unbecoming that person that</v>

3611
02:54:14.971 --> 02:54:16.350
<v Speaker 2>we expect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's pretty mild.</v>

3612
02:54:16.380 --> 02:54:16.920
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my.</v>

3613
02:54:17.050 --> 02:54:19.110
<v Speaker 2>Compared to his leg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his parody of the,</v>

3614
02:54:19.140 --> 02:54:20.040
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3615
02:54:20.730 --> 02:54:23.010
<v Speaker 2>the disabled reporter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who He.</v>

3616
02:54:23.011 --> 02:54:26.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you saw that bit where he did like a,</v>

3617
02:54:26.370 --> 02:54:27.060
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3618
02:54:27.460 --> 02:54:30.840
<v Speaker 2>a cerebral palsy invitation at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at one of his speeches.</v>

3619
02:54:31.290 --> 02:54:31.800
<v Speaker 2>He was the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3620
02:54:31.801 --> 02:54:32.220
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3621
02:54:32.380 --> 02:54:37.380
<v Speaker 2>He was interviewed by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't happen to know who the reporter </v>

3622
02:54:37.380 --> 02:54:37.380
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3623
02:54:37.380 --> 02:54:40.960
<v Speaker 2>he was making.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was making fun of somebody with </v>

3624
02:54:40.960 --> 02:54:42.480
<v Speaker 2>cerebral palsy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's done so many things that you could,</v>

3625
02:54:42.510 --> 02:54:47.510
<v Speaker 2>that you would think would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally canceling of a person's </v>

3626
02:54:47.701 --> 02:54:49.140
<v Speaker 2>political aspirations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3627
02:54:49.141 --> 02:54:54.141
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't even cut marco rubio </v>

3628
02:54:54.141 --> 02:54:54.900
<v Speaker 2>pretending to be like a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>just goofy on someone's cerebral palsy,</v>

3629
02:54:56.500 --> 02:54:59.200
<v Speaker 2>added at one of his campaign events.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3630
02:54:59.490 --> 02:55:00.420
<v Speaker 2>trend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3631
02:55:01.140 --> 02:55:04.130
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that some Ted Cruz was</v>
<v Speaker 2>that video of him</v>

3632
02:55:04.130 --> 02:55:07.110
<v Speaker 1>with his family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the outtakes where they like,</v>

3633
02:55:07.460 --> 02:55:08.310
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't see it.</v>

3634
02:55:08.540 --> 02:55:10.820
<v Speaker 1>It's a gem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's spectacular.</v>

3635
02:55:10.821 --> 02:55:15.821
<v Speaker 1>It's him with his mom and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom prays for me often for hours </v>

3636
02:55:15.821 --> 02:55:17.410
<v Speaker 1>everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she like her.</v>

3637
02:55:17.630 --> 02:55:18.200
<v Speaker 1>She looks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3638
02:55:18.201 --> 02:55:23.201
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about four hours every </v>

3639
02:55:23.201 --> 02:55:23.201
<v Speaker 1>day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3640
02:55:23.201 --> 02:55:23.201
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't even say that.</v>

3641
02:55:23.201 --> 02:55:25.380
<v Speaker 1>And so they have all these really </v>
<v Speaker 1>awkward moments like,</v>

3642
02:55:25.690 --> 02:55:26.930
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go in for a hug.</v>

3643
02:55:27.040 --> 02:55:29.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all.</v>

3644
02:55:29.930 --> 02:55:33.950
<v Speaker 1>It's all like weirdly mapped out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that got online and people were like,</v>

3645
02:55:33.951 --> 02:55:34.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ,</v>

3646
02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:36.790
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See this is.</v>

3647
02:55:37.120 --> 02:55:40.340
<v Speaker 1>This is a bad game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're not even good at this game.</v>

3648
02:55:40.490 --> 02:55:42.200
<v Speaker 1>This is you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're terrible at this game.</v>

3649
02:55:42.540 --> 02:55:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was objectively terrible.</v>

3650
02:55:45.620 --> 02:55:46.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's his.</v>

3651
02:55:46.450 --> 02:55:48.140
<v Speaker 1>That's trumped competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3652
02:55:48.141 --> 02:55:48.940
<v Speaker 1>the thing that would think about</v>

3653
02:55:48.980 --> 02:55:53.980
<v Speaker 2>crews that never even got out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was the reason to be scared about </v>

3654
02:55:53.980 --> 02:55:56.180
<v Speaker 2>a Cruz presidency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was his level of religious craziness.</v>

3655
02:55:56.181 --> 02:56:01.181
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one was even pushing on that because </v>

3656
02:56:01.181 --> 02:56:01.181
<v Speaker 2>there was just enough to push on before</v>

3657
02:56:01.181 --> 02:56:02.650
<v Speaker 1>and got to that door and then you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to hold onto those weapons.</v>

3658
02:56:03.130 --> 02:56:08.130
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hadn't been for had crews been the </v>

3659
02:56:08.130 --> 02:56:08.770
<v Speaker 1>nominee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have been all about religion.</v>

3660
02:56:09.370 --> 02:56:11.860
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's odd is that that's not a handicap</v>

3661
02:56:11.890 --> 02:56:16.630
<v Speaker 1>in 2016 that you can have that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people consider it an asset.</v>

3662
02:56:17.110 --> 02:56:22.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one thing that's surprising and </v>

3663
02:56:22.110 --> 02:56:23.681
<v Speaker 2>actually hopeful in trump's candidacy is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that he has,</v>

3664
02:56:25.010 --> 02:56:29.650
<v Speaker 2>he has dissected out the religious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social conservative component of,</v>

3665
02:56:29.690 --> 02:56:33.800
<v Speaker 2>of the Republican Party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like the evangelicals,</v>

3666
02:56:33.801 --> 02:56:37.370
<v Speaker 2>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going for trump over crews when it</v>

3667
02:56:37.371 --> 02:56:42.140
<v Speaker 2>was pretty clear to them that trump was </v>
<v Speaker 2>just pretending to be religious.</v>

3668
02:56:42.340 --> 02:56:42.950
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's a.</v>

3669
02:56:43.130 --> 02:56:47.690
<v Speaker 2>trump gave one speech at know I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>Liberty University where he spoke.</v>

3670
02:56:47.691 --> 02:56:49.780
<v Speaker 2>He said Corinthians two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3671
02:56:50.210 --> 02:56:55.210
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not the way any bible reader </v>

3672
02:56:55.210 --> 02:56:57.950
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would speak about the second </v>

3673
02:56:57.950 --> 02:56:57.950
<v Speaker 2>Corinthians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would you say it?</v>

3674
02:56:57.950 --> 02:56:59.000
<v Speaker 2>Second Corinthians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how you would say,</v>

3675
02:56:59.010 --> 02:56:59.860
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3676
02:56:59.870 --> 02:57:00.450
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he,</v>

3677
02:57:00.460 --> 02:57:04.690
<v Speaker 2>so he said Corinthians two as like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as though this is something that he just</v>

3678
02:57:04.790 --> 02:57:06.890
<v Speaker 2>opened every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every night before he went to sleep.</v>

3679
02:57:08.120 --> 02:57:12.650
<v Speaker 2>And so it's clear that it was clear to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them that he's,</v>

3680
02:57:12.860 --> 02:57:17.240
<v Speaker 2>that he is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just mining the language,</v>

3681
02:57:17.241 --> 02:57:17.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

3682
02:57:17.930 --> 02:57:22.930
<v Speaker 2>or I'm impersonating a person to faith </v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

3683
02:57:24.260 --> 02:57:27.320
<v Speaker 2>but they don't care really as long as he</v>
<v Speaker 2>does it.</v>

3684
02:57:27.590 --> 02:57:28.790
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>

3685
02:57:28.850 --> 02:57:30.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're gonna look for a silver lining</v>

3686
02:57:30.381 --> 02:57:31.550
<v Speaker 2>to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

3687
02:57:32.030 --> 02:57:37.030
<v Speaker 2>it shows that it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's they just want a space where their </v>

3688
02:57:37.821 --> 02:57:42.821
<v Speaker 2>religious convictions are not under </v>
<v Speaker 2>attack and they don't really care that </v>

3689
02:57:43.161 --> 02:57:45.900
<v Speaker 2>the person in charge share them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just usually,</v>

3690
02:57:46.070 --> 02:57:48.170
<v Speaker 2>if you pretend to share them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's good enough.</v>

3691
02:57:48.830 --> 02:57:49.780
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3692
02:57:50.510 --> 02:57:52.640
<v Speaker 2>that's better than actually carrying </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3693
02:57:52.970 --> 02:57:57.970
<v Speaker 2>This person really believe in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rapture or anything else that is quite </v>

3694
02:57:57.970 --> 02:57:58.970
<v Speaker 2>obviously crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3695
02:57:59.900 --> 02:58:00.470
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3696
02:58:00.530 --> 02:58:05.530
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't think any Christian who was </v>

3697
02:58:05.530 --> 02:58:07.041
<v Speaker 2>voting for trump thinks they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to judge another man's </v>

3698
02:58:07.081 --> 02:58:07.920
<v Speaker 2>faith,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3699
02:58:07.921 --> 02:58:12.921
<v Speaker 2>Or I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who am I to say what's really in his </v>

3700
02:58:12.921 --> 02:58:12.921
<v Speaker 2>heart?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3701
02:58:12.921 --> 02:58:13.780
<v Speaker 2>They'll say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's just given you,</v>

3702
02:58:13.950 --> 02:58:16.170
<v Speaker 2>if you've been paying attention to who </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been and,</v>

3703
02:58:16.280 --> 02:58:19.140
<v Speaker 2>and if you just look at how he talks </v>
<v Speaker 2>about these things,</v>

3704
02:58:19.810 --> 02:58:21.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's falling any,</v>

3705
02:58:22.170 --> 02:58:27.170
<v Speaker 2>any Christian that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think they're willing to vote for </v>

3706
02:58:27.170 --> 02:58:30.801
<v Speaker 2>someone for it now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for other reasons that are fairly </v>

3707
02:58:30.801 --> 02:58:34.670
<v Speaker 2>depressing in their own right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're willing to vote for someone </v>

3708
02:58:34.670 --> 02:58:36.330
<v Speaker 2>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who doesn't really play the game the way</v>

3709
02:58:36.331 --> 02:58:36.630
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>

3710
02:58:40.470 --> 02:58:44.220
<v Speaker 2>You have to believe in God to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>President Two thousand 16.</v>

3711
02:58:44.221 --> 02:58:44.760
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't you?</v>

3712
02:58:44.761 --> 02:58:46.830
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That has to pretend to believe in God.</v>

3713
02:58:47.450 --> 02:58:50.170
<v Speaker 2>But I think with trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

3714
02:58:50.250 --> 02:58:55.250
<v Speaker 2>I think the pretense is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is obvious enough that I don't think </v>

3715
02:58:55.381 --> 02:58:59.700
<v Speaker 2>he's fooling the better part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who were voting for him who,</v>

3716
02:58:59.710 --> 02:59:04.710
<v Speaker 2>who would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who would say they care about a person </v>

3717
02:59:04.710 --> 02:59:04.710
<v Speaker 2>of faith being in the White House.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

3718
02:59:04.710 --> 02:59:09.440
<v Speaker 2>if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he might be in one thing he might be </v>

3719
02:59:09.440 --> 02:59:12.201
<v Speaker 2>breaking is the barrier on having an </v>
<v Speaker 2>atheist president because I think he,</v>

3720
02:59:13.730 --> 02:59:16.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just nobody,</v>

3721
02:59:16.440 --> 02:59:19.830
<v Speaker 2>nobody thinks he is a person to faith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anyone really thinks that.</v>

3722
02:59:20.440 --> 02:59:22.430
<v Speaker 2>So he's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's made,</v>

3723
02:59:22.431 --> 02:59:24.750
<v Speaker 2>it might be our first atheist president </v>
<v Speaker 2>who would help us in that,</v>

3724
02:59:24.960 --> 02:59:28.020
<v Speaker 2>in that regard as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another trump media right into the White</v>

3725
02:59:28.020 --> 02:59:33.020
<v Speaker 2>House.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm starting to sound like a trump </v>

3726
02:59:33.020 --> 02:59:33.020
<v Speaker 2>supporter.</v>

3727
02:59:33.020 --> 02:59:33.020
<v Speaker 2>Occasionally an asteroid does something </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

3728
02:59:33.020 --> 02:59:34.490
<v Speaker 2>Who would be the ideal president?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like what,</v>

3729
02:59:34.520 --> 02:59:37.020
<v Speaker 2>what kind of a person?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it would probably be a person who</v>

3730
02:59:37.021 --> 02:59:40.560
<v Speaker 2>doesn't seek attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably be a person that.</v>

3731
02:59:40.620 --> 02:59:41.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it could be that.</v>

3732
02:59:41.860 --> 02:59:44.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3733
02:59:44.170 --> 02:59:48.720
<v Speaker 2>the process is even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even an optimized process will be,</v>

3734
02:59:49.980 --> 02:59:51.680
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will,</v>

3735
02:59:52.820 --> 02:59:57.820
<v Speaker 2>will require enough sacrifice of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>ordinary people want.</v>

3736
02:59:58.770 --> 03:00:03.770
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time that it will be an </v>
<v Speaker 2>unusual personality who has to get </v>

3737
03:00:03.770 --> 03:00:05.450
<v Speaker 2>promoted and you will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will be on some metric be.</v>

3738
03:00:06.940 --> 03:00:11.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost by definition narcissistic </v>

3739
03:00:11.940 --> 03:00:11.940
<v Speaker 2>to think that you should be in this role</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3740
03:00:11.940 --> 03:00:16.140
<v Speaker 2>Who are you to think that you should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>running a civilization at this moment in</v>

3741
03:00:16.141 --> 03:00:17.730
<v Speaker 2>human history?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3742
03:00:18.180 --> 03:00:19.410
<v Speaker 2>and to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for you to be on it,</v>

3743
03:00:19.411 --> 03:00:22.080
<v Speaker 2>for you to honestly stand at the podium </v>
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>

3744
03:00:23.040 --> 03:00:27.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm the guy or the woman like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am the most qualified,</v>

3745
03:00:27.031 --> 03:00:28.200
<v Speaker 2>I should be doing this.</v>

3746
03:00:28.260 --> 03:00:29.280
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can help.</v>

3747
03:00:29.900 --> 03:00:31.460
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3748
03:00:31.461 --> 03:00:36.461
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to scrutinize the kind </v>

3749
03:00:36.461 --> 03:00:36.461
<v Speaker 2>of personality that could give rise to </v>
<v Speaker 2>those opinions,</v>

3750
03:00:37.080 --> 03:00:38.340
<v Speaker 2>it's not you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3751
03:00:38.341 --> 03:00:42.380
<v Speaker 2>There's some dials you would probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to chain tweak if you,</v>

3752
03:00:42.440 --> 03:00:46.590
<v Speaker 2>if you had to be married to this person </v>
<v Speaker 2>or if it's not an optimal personality.</v>

3753
03:00:46.620 --> 03:00:49.470
<v Speaker 2>So there's going to be kind of pathology</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

3754
03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:53.190
<v Speaker 2>of power seeking that might be just </v>
<v Speaker 2>intrinsic to it.</v>

3755
03:00:53.700 --> 03:00:54.900
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3756
03:00:56.010 --> 03:00:59.100
<v Speaker 2>you want someone who is actually wise </v>
<v Speaker 2>ethically.</v>

3757
03:00:59.210 --> 03:01:00.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

3758
03:01:00.280 --> 03:01:05.280
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just trying to map that onto </v>

3759
03:01:05.280 --> 03:01:05.280
<v Speaker 2>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3760
03:01:05.280 --> 03:01:05.280
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's.</v>

3761
03:01:05.280 --> 03:01:08.850
<v Speaker 2>Imagine someone saying thing I like </v>
<v Speaker 2>about trump is that he is so deeply </v>

3762
03:01:08.850 --> 03:01:11.320
<v Speaker 2>ethical and wise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3763
03:01:11.740 --> 03:01:14.680
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does not.</v>

3764
03:01:14.770 --> 03:01:19.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like saying it's because of his </v>

3765
03:01:19.770 --> 03:01:19.770
<v Speaker 2>hair looks so natural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3766
03:01:19.770 --> 03:01:19.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

3767
03:01:19.841 --> 03:01:21.320
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3768
03:01:21.640 --> 03:01:24.250
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is the antithesis of what he is,</v>

3769
03:01:24.550 --> 03:01:24.850
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3770
03:01:25.320 --> 03:01:26.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3771
03:01:26.430 --> 03:01:31.430
<v Speaker 2>the thing I like about trump is that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>is so well informed about the way the </v>

3772
03:01:31.430 --> 03:01:36.211
<v Speaker 2>world works and where he's not informed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he recognizes his ignorance so quickly </v>

3773
03:01:37.961 --> 03:01:42.961
<v Speaker 2>and he remedies it as fast as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He do know he seeks out the best </v>

3774
03:01:42.961 --> 03:01:44.620
<v Speaker 2>experts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>defers to them.</v>

3775
03:01:45.240 --> 03:01:47.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

3776
03:01:48.170 --> 03:01:48.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just,</v>

3777
03:01:48.910 --> 03:01:51.970
<v Speaker 2>he's mindful of the limits of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge.</v>

3778
03:01:52.310 --> 03:01:57.310
<v Speaker 2>Seo As,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as he is about his expertise and his </v>

3779
03:01:57.310 --> 03:01:57.310
<v Speaker 2>expertise is vast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3780
03:01:57.610 --> 03:01:59.710
<v Speaker 2>You'd want to be able to say that about </v>
<v Speaker 2>a president.</v>

3781
03:01:59.740 --> 03:02:02.020
<v Speaker 2>You could not begin to say that about </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump,</v>

3782
03:02:02.080 --> 03:02:05.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could probably say that.</v>

3783
03:02:05.290 --> 03:02:10.290
<v Speaker 2>Honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could probably say that about </v>

3784
03:02:10.290 --> 03:02:10.290
<v Speaker 2>Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3785
03:02:10.290 --> 03:02:10.290
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

3786
03:02:10.290 --> 03:02:13.800
<v Speaker 2>for all her defects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's very knowledgeable and I'm sure </v>

3787
03:02:14.470 --> 03:02:16.690
<v Speaker 2>she will just try it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where she,</v>

3788
03:02:16.900 --> 03:02:21.900
<v Speaker 2>where she doesn't feel like she's got </v>
<v Speaker 2>the knowledge he's going to try to go </v>

3789
03:02:21.900 --> 03:02:21.900
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to the source of the knowledge.</v>

3790
03:02:21.900 --> 03:02:24.430
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just grab the best experts you can find.</v>

3791
03:02:25.180 --> 03:02:27.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she,</v>

3792
03:02:27.100 --> 03:02:32.100
<v Speaker 2>I think she will be as aware as you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be of the consequences of not </v>

3793
03:02:33.071 --> 03:02:34.210
<v Speaker 2>knowing what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3794
03:02:34.290 --> 03:02:36.340
<v Speaker 2>She's just going to want to find out </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on.</v>

3795
03:02:36.730 --> 03:02:41.730
<v Speaker 2>Whereas this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean all trump has advertised about </v>

3796
03:02:41.730 --> 03:02:45.151
<v Speaker 2>himself is that he thinks that bluster </v>
<v Speaker 2>and banality and bullying will win in </v>

3797
03:02:49.421 --> 03:02:51.850
<v Speaker 2>every situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like it's just attitude.</v>

3798
03:02:51.880 --> 03:02:56.880
<v Speaker 2>He's the guy is the guy is winging it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it could not be more obvious that </v>

3799
03:02:58.780 --> 03:03:01.480
<v Speaker 2>this guy is winging it on every level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like it's just,</v>

3800
03:03:01.570 --> 03:03:03.160
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

3801
03:03:04.470 --> 03:03:09.470
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There there'd be no way for him to </v>

3802
03:03:09.470 --> 03:03:11.821
<v Speaker 2>signal the fact that he's winging it </v>
<v Speaker 2>more clearly than he is with everything </v>

3803
03:03:11.821 --> 03:03:13.990
<v Speaker 2>he's doing and and yet there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>penalty.</v>

3804
03:03:14.470 --> 03:03:17.650
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's possible that in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>age of information,</v>

3805
03:03:17.680 --> 03:03:22.680
<v Speaker 1>the way we can communicate with each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other that we're going to experience </v>

3806
03:03:22.680 --> 03:03:22.680
<v Speaker 1>these cycles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these waves,</v>

3807
03:03:22.690 --> 03:03:27.690
<v Speaker 1>these in and outs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these high and low tides of really smart</v>

3808
03:03:28.511 --> 03:03:33.511
<v Speaker 1>presidents and really stupid president </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we just people revolt and there's </v>

3809
03:03:33.511 --> 03:03:35.200
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so easy to stay alive.</v>

3810
03:03:35.201 --> 03:03:40.201
<v Speaker 1>It's plenty of students who fill out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and so they're only willing to </v>

3811
03:03:40.201 --> 03:03:43.141
<v Speaker 1>vote for other dme folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the other dme folks get into </v>

3812
03:03:43.141 --> 03:03:46.350
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They send out the frequency that only </v>

3813
03:03:46.350 --> 03:03:46.350
<v Speaker 1>the dummies here and everybody else is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

3814
03:03:46.350 --> 03:03:49.750
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is everybody voting for </v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy for what is happening,</v>

3815
03:03:50.080 --> 03:03:55.080
<v Speaker 1>and then it makes the smart people </v>
<v Speaker 1>rebound and for years and challenge </v>

3816
03:03:55.080 --> 03:03:59.221
<v Speaker 1>themselves a new because they they need </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of an enemy to rally against to </v>

3817
03:03:59.221 --> 03:04:02.660
<v Speaker 1>reach their full potential and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>without the low tide,</v>

3818
03:04:02.661 --> 03:04:04.830
<v Speaker 1>you cannot have the high tide Sam </v>
<v Speaker 1>Harris.</v>

3819
03:04:06.410 --> 03:04:11.410
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully that's not an analogy that </v>
<v Speaker 1>applies for the maintenance of </v>

3820
03:04:11.410 --> 03:04:14.100
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This smell the time man.</v>

3821
03:04:14.120 --> 03:04:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Maybe at the very least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a wakeup call for the political </v>

3822
03:04:19.120 --> 03:04:19.890
<v Speaker 1>establishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This silly game that you've been running</v>

3823
03:04:19.891 --> 03:04:24.320
<v Speaker 1>have two candidates just doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone can cooperate your candidacy.</v>

3824
03:04:24.350 --> 03:04:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Get in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw the fucking monkey wrench into the</v>

3825
03:04:27.201 --> 03:04:29.660
<v Speaker 1>gear system and guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump's running for president now.</v>

3826
03:04:29.661 --> 03:04:30.770
<v Speaker 1>He's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the head,</v>

3827
03:04:31.430 --> 03:04:34.280
<v Speaker 1>he's the head guy for the Republicans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is that even possible?</v>

3828
03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:35.630
<v Speaker 1>They don't know.</v>

3829
03:04:35.970 --> 03:04:37.430
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a way,</v>

3830
03:04:37.460 --> 03:04:42.460
<v Speaker 2>if nothing else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has a total wakeup call for the </v>

3831
03:04:42.460 --> 03:04:42.460
<v Speaker 2>Republicans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3832
03:04:42.460 --> 03:04:42.460
<v Speaker 2>they are just,</v>

3833
03:04:42.460 --> 03:04:42.480
<v Speaker 1>it's June aghast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3834
03:04:42.560 --> 03:04:45.740
<v Speaker 1>it's June.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's decided locked down.</v>

3835
03:04:45.830 --> 03:04:48.200
<v Speaker 1>So we have July,</v>
<v Speaker 1>August,</v>

3836
03:04:48.201 --> 03:04:49.700
<v Speaker 1>September,</v>
<v Speaker 1>October,</v>

3837
03:04:49.701 --> 03:04:51.710
<v Speaker 1>November.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're that close.</v>

3838
03:04:53.820 --> 03:04:58.820
<v Speaker 2>But he's not someone who has been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is aligned with the Republican </v>

3839
03:04:58.921 --> 03:05:03.330
<v Speaker 2>platform in most ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3840
03:05:03.331 --> 03:05:08.331
<v Speaker 2>So it's like he's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>truth is virtually no one knows what his</v>

3841
03:05:09.091 --> 03:05:12.660
<v Speaker 2>policies are because he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he keeps changing his position on things</v>

3842
03:05:12.661 --> 03:05:14.640
<v Speaker 2>like taxation and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there actually is no keys,</v>

3843
03:05:14.641 --> 03:05:17.520
<v Speaker 2>he said he's talked to on both sides of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

3844
03:05:17.670 --> 03:05:20.190
<v Speaker 2>of core issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>core Republican issues.</v>

3845
03:05:20.191 --> 03:05:24.960
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in many ways he's left of Hillary,</v>

3846
03:05:25.440 --> 03:05:26.310
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

3847
03:05:26.400 --> 03:05:31.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's left of Hillary in terms of being </v>

3848
03:05:31.400 --> 03:05:31.400
<v Speaker 2>an isolationist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's,</v>

3849
03:05:31.400 --> 03:05:31.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3850
03:05:32.070 --> 03:05:35.700
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his relationship to war is,</v>

3851
03:05:36.420 --> 03:05:37.650
<v Speaker 2>but both extremes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3852
03:05:37.651 --> 03:05:39.210
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3853
03:05:39.211 --> 03:05:44.211
<v Speaker 2>we're just gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna get out of the world's </v>

3854
03:05:44.211 --> 03:05:44.211
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3855
03:05:44.211 --> 03:05:45.940
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be isolationists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is deeply anti Republican.</v>

3856
03:05:46.370 --> 03:05:51.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to be the maniac who </v>

3857
03:05:51.370 --> 03:05:51.530
<v Speaker 2>you're never going to know who I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to bomb next.</v>

3858
03:05:51.640 --> 03:05:53.220
<v Speaker 2>We're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to wipe out isis.</v>

3859
03:05:53.221 --> 03:05:54.600
<v Speaker 2>We're just straight away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3860
03:05:54.601 --> 03:05:56.640
<v Speaker 2>Did Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a man left standing.</v>

3861
03:05:57.150 --> 03:06:02.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not gonna take any shit from </v>

3862
03:06:02.150 --> 03:06:03.660
<v Speaker 2>anyone including China and North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he's that.</v>

3863
03:06:03.661 --> 03:06:07.770
<v Speaker 2>But we're going to pull back in a huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>way and not be in anyone's business,</v>

3864
03:06:07.800 --> 03:06:09.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said both of those things.</v>

3865
03:06:09.980 --> 03:06:12.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3866
03:06:13.790 --> 03:06:15.750
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3867
03:06:16.320 --> 03:06:21.320
<v Speaker 2>it's way too interesting way it may.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't want politics to be this </v>

3868
03:06:21.511 --> 03:06:26.280
<v Speaker 2>interesting and it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>November is going to be if the polls are</v>

3869
03:06:26.281 --> 03:06:28.620
<v Speaker 2>closed and watching those debates and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3870
03:06:28.750 --> 03:06:29.700
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3871
03:06:30.450 --> 03:06:35.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>waiting for swinging the polls as a </v>

3872
03:06:35.450 --> 03:06:35.450
<v Speaker 2>result,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just going to be,</v>

3873
03:06:35.450 --> 03:06:38.630
<v Speaker 2>it's to be way too interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's gonna be like watching the </v>

3874
03:06:38.630 --> 03:06:38.630
<v Speaker 2>superbowl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those first debates,</v>

3875
03:06:38.630 --> 03:06:43.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be 100 million people </v>

3876
03:06:43.090 --> 03:06:44.010
<v Speaker 2>watching those debates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a prediction.</v>

3877
03:06:45.210 --> 03:06:46.290
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3878
03:06:48.660 --> 03:06:53.660
<v Speaker 1>I think it's entirely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This whole thing was a plot that didn't </v>

3879
03:06:53.660 --> 03:06:56.190
<v Speaker 1>work out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he probably came out of the gate</v>

3880
03:06:56.190 --> 03:07:01.190
<v Speaker 2>saying crazy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking he would tank the Republican </v>

3881
03:07:01.190 --> 03:07:05.210
<v Speaker 2>Party and get his friend Hillary Clinton</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the White House that she didn't </v>

3882
03:07:05.210 --> 03:07:07.590
<v Speaker 2>attend to work out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kept trying to insult her,</v>

3883
03:07:07.890 --> 03:07:12.890
<v Speaker 2>kept trying to make stuff up about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexicans and it just kept making them </v>

3884
03:07:12.890 --> 03:07:13.020
<v Speaker 2>get better and better and now he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuck.</v>

3885
03:07:13.470 --> 03:07:17.120
<v Speaker 2>He can't pull out that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be.</v>

3886
03:07:17.121 --> 03:07:19.260
<v Speaker 2>That would be a great moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would change the system.</v>

3887
03:07:19.710 --> 03:07:24.710
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have to go through </v>

3888
03:07:24.710 --> 03:07:24.710
<v Speaker 2>something like this in order for us to </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize that this is crazy,</v>

3889
03:07:24.710 --> 03:07:26.910
<v Speaker 2>that a guy can just do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can just not really have any interest in</v>

3890
03:07:26.911 --> 03:07:31.911
<v Speaker 2>politics until that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he should get the Nobel prize </v>

3891
03:07:31.911 --> 03:07:32.550
<v Speaker 2>for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he pulls out at this point and says,</v>

3892
03:07:32.551 --> 03:07:33.450
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>

3893
03:07:33.550 --> 03:07:38.550
<v Speaker 2>I took you to the precipice here just </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I wanted you to recognize how </v>

3894
03:07:38.610 --> 03:07:40.980
<v Speaker 2>unstable this situation is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3895
03:07:40.981 --> 03:07:45.981
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys could elect a demagogue who is </v>

3896
03:07:47.551 --> 03:07:49.200
<v Speaker 2>actually an incoherent demagogue.</v>

3897
03:07:49.230 --> 03:07:54.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't even been playing an </v>

3898
03:07:54.230 --> 03:07:54.230
<v Speaker 2>incoherent authoritarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3901
03:07:54.900 --> 03:07:59.900
<v Speaker 2>on one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very liberal right and tolerant and on</v>

3902
03:08:00.571 --> 03:08:05.571
<v Speaker 2>the other hand I'm like getting ready to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be Hitler and you guys can't figure out </v>

3903
03:08:05.571 --> 03:08:07.080
<v Speaker 2>who I am and yet you're still prepared </v>
<v Speaker 2>to vote for me.</v>

3904
03:08:07.650 --> 03:08:08.700
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3905
03:08:08.820 --> 03:08:11.040
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for him to do a postmortem on,</v>

3906
03:08:11.070 --> 03:08:13.710
<v Speaker 2>on his Punkin of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the culture,</v>

3907
03:08:14.250 --> 03:08:16.710
<v Speaker 2>that would be the best thing to ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

3908
03:08:17.280 --> 03:08:17.790
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3909
03:08:17.910 --> 03:08:22.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need someone like this so that we </v>

3910
03:08:22.910 --> 03:08:25.300
<v Speaker 2>realize how silly this whole thing is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do we need some,</v>

3911
03:08:25.700 --> 03:08:30.700
<v Speaker 2>we need a qualified person to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the other hassles and dangers </v>

3912
03:08:30.700 --> 03:08:32.010
<v Speaker 2>that are coming our way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that have nothing to do with,</v>

3913
03:08:32.330 --> 03:08:35.490
<v Speaker 2>with what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that person's not there.</v>

3914
03:08:35.520 --> 03:08:38.220
<v Speaker 2>Even even if we were doing everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly,</v>

3915
03:08:39.450 --> 03:08:44.450
<v Speaker 2>they would still be this tsunami of risk</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hassle and waste and all the rest of</v>

3916
03:08:52.621 --> 03:08:55.260
<v Speaker 2>the world's chaos that is coming our </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

3917
03:08:55.340 --> 03:08:58.260
<v Speaker 2>And it just forget,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if we had our,</v>

3918
03:08:58.261 --> 03:09:00.630
<v Speaker 2>our house in order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in every respect,</v>

3919
03:09:01.260 --> 03:09:05.480
<v Speaker 2>we still have terrorism and the global </v>
<v Speaker 2>climate change will,</v>

3920
03:09:05.490 --> 03:09:06.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got,</v>

3921
03:09:06.070 --> 03:09:10.410
<v Speaker 2>you've got China and India and what are </v>
<v Speaker 2>they doing in terms of a compliant with,</v>

3922
03:09:11.010 --> 03:09:11.760
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3923
03:09:12.030 --> 03:09:13.440
<v Speaker 2>climate goals?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3924
03:09:14.460 --> 03:09:16.800
<v Speaker 2>you have all the things we've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>

3925
03:09:17.790 --> 03:09:21.430
<v Speaker 2>the virtual certainty that there's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a pandemic at the,</v>

3926
03:09:21.510 --> 03:09:22.830
<v Speaker 2>what I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bioterrorism,</v>

3927
03:09:23.070 --> 03:09:28.070
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about just the sheer fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that in 1919 there was a killer flu and </v>

3928
03:09:28.291 --> 03:09:30.120
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be another killer flew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3929
03:09:30.121 --> 03:09:31.950
<v Speaker 2>There's just no way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not gonna be another killer flu.</v>

3930
03:09:32.620 --> 03:09:35.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we need,</v>

3931
03:09:35.910 --> 03:09:40.740
<v Speaker 2>we need people and we need people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people to smart people to change the,</v>

3932
03:09:40.741 --> 03:09:43.530
<v Speaker 2>to optimize the system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to deal with these kinds of things.</v>

3933
03:09:43.650 --> 03:09:48.650
<v Speaker 2>And if we're promoting religious maniacs</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3934
03:09:48.980 --> 03:09:53.980
<v Speaker 2>and crazy narcissists and liars and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ignoramuses and only those people,</v>

3935
03:09:59.140 --> 03:10:00.490
<v Speaker 2>how could this end will.</v>

3936
03:10:00.830 --> 03:10:05.830
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is just a weird year for </v>

3937
03:10:05.830 --> 03:10:05.830
<v Speaker 3>heavyweight boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3938
03:10:05.830 --> 03:10:10.011
<v Speaker 3>they have those weird years for Tony </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened to be where you could be the </v>

3939
03:10:11.641 --> 03:10:16.641
<v Speaker 3>heavyweight champion of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They went through a period of time in </v>

3940
03:10:16.641 --> 03:10:18.150
<v Speaker 3>like the early eighties for Tyson came </v>
<v Speaker 3>around was a series of like these champs</v>

3941
03:10:18.151 --> 03:10:19.060
<v Speaker 3>that were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3942
03:10:19.080 --> 03:10:21.960
<v Speaker 3>sort of like journeymen fighters and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then Tyson came along.</v>

3943
03:10:21.990 --> 03:10:24.160
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but only only with heavyweights,</v>

3944
03:10:24.240 --> 03:10:25.170
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3945
03:10:25.171 --> 03:10:26.580
<v Speaker 3>Mostly with heavyweights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3946
03:10:26.610 --> 03:10:27.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The lighter weights,</v>

3947
03:10:27.841 --> 03:10:32.841
<v Speaker 3>they were always bad ass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that maybe that's what's </v>

3948
03:10:32.841 --> 03:10:33.090
<v Speaker 3>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we need to have this bad season,</v>

3949
03:10:33.350 --> 03:10:38.350
<v Speaker 3>get the season out of our way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>realize the danger of having an inept </v>

3950
03:10:38.350 --> 03:10:42.891
<v Speaker 3>person in office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a liar or a to hates money </v>

3951
03:10:42.891 --> 03:10:42.891
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

3952
03:10:42.950 --> 03:10:46.410
<v Speaker 3>or trump or whoever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just go through it and realize how silly</v>

3953
03:10:46.411 --> 03:10:48.690
<v Speaker 3>it is that we have it set up this way </v>
<v Speaker 3>still.</v>

3954
03:10:48.980 --> 03:10:51.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Except people thought that of Hitler.</v>

3955
03:10:52.170 --> 03:10:57.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is any comparison to Hitler </v>

3956
03:10:57.170 --> 03:10:57.170
<v Speaker 2>obviously brands you as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3957
03:10:57.170 --> 03:10:58.140
<v Speaker 2>an exaggerator but</v>

3958
03:10:59.320 --> 03:11:04.320
<v Speaker 3>they thought let them get in there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck it up and then we'll have somebody </v>

3959
03:11:04.320 --> 03:11:04.320
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hitler was a,</v>

3960
03:11:04.320 --> 03:11:04.320
<v Speaker 3>a</v>

3961
03:11:04.320 --> 03:11:05.930
<v Speaker 2>comic figure for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a good long while.</v>

3962
03:11:05.931 --> 03:11:10.931
<v Speaker 2>And people were including the American </v>
<v Speaker 2>press were incredibly slow to recognize </v>

3963
03:11:12.620 --> 03:11:14.870
<v Speaker 2>what a sinister character he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was,</v>

3964
03:11:14.900 --> 03:11:18.800
<v Speaker 2>he was considered a buffoon and a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there was,</v>

3965
03:11:18.801 --> 03:11:19.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was like a,</v>

3966
03:11:20.200 --> 03:11:20.600
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

3967
03:11:20.601 --> 03:11:23.840
<v Speaker 2>maybe Jamie can find this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was home and garden.</v>

3968
03:11:24.110 --> 03:11:25.880
<v Speaker 2>I think it was homeland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it house in home and garden,</v>

3969
03:11:26.690 --> 03:11:27.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a,</v>

3970
03:11:28.070 --> 03:11:30.970
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a write up on his,</v>

3971
03:11:30.971 --> 03:11:34.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eagle's nest or his house that was just,</v>

3972
03:11:34.270 --> 03:11:37.420
<v Speaker 2>just this pure puff piece of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

3973
03:11:38.060 --> 03:11:43.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitler love in our architectural </v>

3974
03:11:43.060 --> 03:11:44.410
<v Speaker 2>magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm at home with the fuel.</v>

3975
03:11:45.230 --> 03:11:47.070
<v Speaker 2>I think this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a,</v>

3976
03:11:47.250 --> 03:11:48.980
<v Speaker 2>was like a guardian right up under </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

3977
03:11:49.130 --> 03:11:50.630
<v Speaker 2>Homes and gardens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3978
03:11:50.990 --> 03:11:52.750
<v Speaker 2>So that people can see the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3979
03:11:52.850 --> 03:11:57.850
<v Speaker 2>the actual pages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're pdfs online of the </v>

3980
03:11:57.850 --> 03:11:57.850
<v Speaker 2>actual pages of the article.</v>

3981
03:11:57.850 --> 03:12:00.140
<v Speaker 2>But this is probably a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the actual text of the article.</v>

3982
03:12:00.560 --> 03:12:01.520
<v Speaker 2>But it's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

3983
03:12:01.521 --> 03:12:03.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like architectural digest does,</v>

3984
03:12:03.561 --> 03:12:06.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Eagle's nest and.</v>

3985
03:12:06.410 --> 03:12:11.410
<v Speaker 2>But it's at a time where it's not too </v>
<v Speaker 2>far away from a moment where it should </v>

3986
03:12:11.431 --> 03:12:16.431
<v Speaker 2>have been absolutely obvious to every </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking person that this guy was going </v>

3987
03:12:16.431 --> 03:12:18.470
<v Speaker 2>to try to conquer the world for evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3988
03:12:20.360 --> 03:12:23.450
<v Speaker 2>And yet it was not obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3989
03:12:23.570 --> 03:12:25.910
<v Speaker 2>and when you look at how it was not </v>
<v Speaker 2>obvious,</v>

3990
03:12:25.911 --> 03:12:27.170
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty humble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3991
03:12:27.171 --> 03:12:27.950
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know,</v>

3992
03:12:27.951 --> 03:12:32.951
<v Speaker 2>you would have been necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>different because up until this </v>

3993
03:12:32.951 --> 03:12:36.671
<v Speaker 2>conversation practically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been looking at trump as a clown.</v>

3994
03:12:37.910 --> 03:12:39.270
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how,</v>

3995
03:12:39.500 --> 03:12:40.580
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

3996
03:12:40.581 --> 03:12:44.840
<v Speaker 2>what would this clown actually do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the power of the presidency?</v>

3997
03:12:44.990 --> 03:12:45.410
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3998
03:12:45.500 --> 03:12:47.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that he couldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3999
03:12:47.181 --> 03:12:52.181
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's given voice to a kind of </v>

4000
03:12:52.181 --> 03:12:53.150
<v Speaker 2>authoritarianism that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4001
03:12:53.180 --> 03:12:55.370
<v Speaker 2>some people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his enemies are noticing,</v>

4002
03:12:55.371 --> 03:12:58.520
<v Speaker 2>his friends are discounting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's talked about,</v>

4003
03:12:58.580 --> 03:13:00.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going after the press.</v>

4004
03:13:00.170 --> 03:13:02.330
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's bragged about how many people,</v>

4005
03:13:02.331 --> 03:13:03.770
<v Speaker 2>he's gonna Torture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4006
03:13:04.190 --> 03:13:04.980
<v Speaker 2>He's talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4007
03:13:04.981 --> 03:13:09.981
<v Speaker 2>well of course we're gonna would do </v>
<v Speaker 2>waterboarding and we're going to do </v>

4008
03:13:09.981 --> 03:13:10.520
<v Speaker 2>worse and what maybe will kill the kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>the families of terrorists.</v>

4009
03:13:10.521 --> 03:13:12.190
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he told he he,</v>

4010
03:13:12.230 --> 03:13:17.120
<v Speaker 2>but there's a kind of a um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just,</v>

4011
03:13:17.150 --> 03:13:20.300
<v Speaker 2>he's going to make America great again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

4012
03:13:20.360 --> 03:13:25.360
<v Speaker 2>what would he do if he actually had more</v>
<v Speaker 2>power than anyone in the world?</v>

4013
03:13:25.581 --> 03:13:26.990
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4014
03:13:27.780 --> 03:13:32.620
<v Speaker 2>it's a legit question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The transition from comedy to a,</v>

4015
03:13:32.690 --> 03:13:34.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't take this back,</v>

4016
03:13:34.850 --> 03:13:38.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in anything like a short order,</v>

4017
03:13:39.280 --> 03:13:40.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be,</v>

4018
03:13:40.310 --> 03:13:45.310
<v Speaker 2>that could well be terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do go back to the question of </v>

4019
03:13:46.161 --> 03:13:51.161
<v Speaker 2>heavyweights?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think you could be a fake </v>

4020
03:13:51.161 --> 03:13:51.161
<v Speaker 2>heavyweight and not a fake</v>

4021
03:13:51.161 --> 03:13:54.890
<v Speaker 3>middleware?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not that many really good </v>

4022
03:13:54.890 --> 03:13:59.131
<v Speaker 3>athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go to boxing when they really </v>

4023
03:13:59.131 --> 03:14:01.261
<v Speaker 3>large.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They tend to go to football or </v>

4024
03:14:01.261 --> 03:14:01.261
<v Speaker 3>interesting or basketball after really </v>
<v Speaker 3>tall.</v>

4025
03:14:01.261 --> 03:14:01.600
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4026
03:14:02.200 --> 03:14:06.610
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the amount of money that </v>
<v Speaker 3>like guys in the NBA can make or guys in</v>

4027
03:14:06.611 --> 03:14:07.910
<v Speaker 3>the NFL can make.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4028
03:14:07.960 --> 03:14:10.300
<v Speaker 3>they're really top level guys can make a</v>
<v Speaker 3>tremendous amount of money.</v>

4029
03:14:10.301 --> 03:14:13.030
<v Speaker 3>So when you get to really super athlete </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>

4030
03:14:13.450 --> 03:14:18.450
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tend to gravitate towards the big </v>

4031
03:14:18.450 --> 03:14:18.450
<v Speaker 3>name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4032
03:14:18.450 --> 03:14:18.450
<v Speaker 3>there's no bigger name sport than </v>
<v Speaker 3>football.</v>

4033
03:14:18.450 --> 03:14:23.140
<v Speaker 3>So getting someone to abandoned the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole team thing and having the balls to</v>

4034
03:14:23.141 --> 03:14:28.141
<v Speaker 3>go one on one in a cage and having that </v>
<v Speaker 3>mentality that's also very different </v>

4035
03:14:28.141 --> 03:14:30.850
<v Speaker 3>because it's not necessarily the </v>
<v Speaker 3>smartest thing to do,</v>

4036
03:14:31.150 --> 03:14:36.150
<v Speaker 3>but it's the most challenging thing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do and there's some really smart people </v>

4037
03:14:36.150 --> 03:14:36.150
<v Speaker 3>that do it.</v>

4038
03:14:36.150 --> 03:14:39.750
<v Speaker 3>So even though cage fighting isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not the safest way to get through </v>

4039
03:14:39.750 --> 03:14:44.101
<v Speaker 3>life for a lot of people that engage in </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and it becomes like an extreme,</v>

4040
03:14:45.130 --> 03:14:48.640
<v Speaker 3>extremely difficult pursuit and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what it becomes to them,</v>

4041
03:14:49.210 --> 03:14:50.860
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in the heavyweight division,</v>

4042
03:14:52.150 --> 03:14:55.690
<v Speaker 3>those guys were being lured into other </v>
<v Speaker 3>ways and boxing was just kind of went in</v>

4043
03:14:55.691 --> 03:14:58.150
<v Speaker 3>through like a hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a peak and a valley when Ali.</v>

4044
03:14:58.151 --> 03:14:59.200
<v Speaker 3>And then it went.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Larry Holmes,</v>

4045
03:14:59.440 --> 03:15:04.440
<v Speaker 3>Larry Holmes was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People didn't appreciate him for how </v>

4046
03:15:04.440 --> 03:15:07.561
<v Speaker 3>good he was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that doesn't have the middleweight </v>

4047
03:15:07.561 --> 03:15:10.260
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was not the same competition for </v>

4048
03:15:10.260 --> 03:15:12.511
<v Speaker 3>that kind of athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will for a little dinky little lulls </v>

4049
03:15:12.511 --> 03:15:13.030
<v Speaker 3>in the middleweight division,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's always pretty fucking strong.</v>

4050
03:15:13.090 --> 03:15:13.750
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

4051
03:15:13.840 --> 03:15:18.840
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't you have the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition for the high level athlete </v>

4052
03:15:19.121 --> 03:15:24.121
<v Speaker 2>at one 65 weight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's just not our favorite </v>

4053
03:15:24.121 --> 03:15:25.110
<v Speaker 2>sports or require bigger people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4054
03:15:25.111 --> 03:15:25.180
<v Speaker 2>Bowling,</v>

4055
03:15:25.220 --> 03:15:29.550
<v Speaker 3>basketball and football and baseball </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't really apply here.</v>

4056
03:15:29.640 --> 03:15:32.340
<v Speaker 3>The amount of cultures that produce </v>
<v Speaker 3>heavyweights,</v>

4057
03:15:32.430 --> 03:15:37.430
<v Speaker 3>first of all are fairly limited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like very few heavyweights have come </v>

4058
03:15:37.430 --> 03:15:42.111
<v Speaker 3>from Asia except a polynesian guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I guess is kind of Asian.</v>

4059
03:15:42.840 --> 03:15:45.030
<v Speaker 3>But like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Samoans,</v>

4060
03:15:45.031 --> 03:15:47.490
<v Speaker 3>samoans known to be great for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But giant,</v>

4061
03:15:47.491 --> 03:15:52.491
<v Speaker 3>sturdy heavyweights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the Chinese don't really produce </v>

4062
03:15:52.491 --> 03:15:52.910
<v Speaker 3>them that often,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they don't.</v>

4063
03:15:52.960 --> 03:15:55.980
<v Speaker 3>The people don't get that big in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sumo,</v>

4064
03:15:55.981 --> 03:15:57.450
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're very fat.</v>

4065
03:15:57.780 --> 03:16:02.780
<v Speaker 3>There's never been like a guy who looks </v>
<v Speaker 3>like Mike Tyson that came out of Japan </v>

4066
03:16:02.780 --> 03:16:04.830
<v Speaker 3>and the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

4067
03:16:05.520 --> 03:16:09.180
<v Speaker 3>We're seeing more of that now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean if we had a guy that was like</v>

4068
03:16:09.181 --> 03:16:12.420
<v Speaker 3>a Japanese version of Mike Tyson just to</v>
<v Speaker 3>super fast,</v>

4069
03:16:12.421 --> 03:16:15.120
<v Speaker 3>blinding knockout fighter with a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>head,</v>

4070
03:16:15.121 --> 03:16:20.121
<v Speaker 3>like a brick wall and the giant neck </v>
<v Speaker 3>that started above his ears and went </v>

4071
03:16:20.121 --> 03:16:20.121
<v Speaker 3>down to his traps.</v>

4072
03:16:20.121 --> 03:16:22.230
<v Speaker 3>You remember Tyson when he first came on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the scene,</v>

4073
03:16:22.740 --> 03:16:27.740
<v Speaker 3>he was unbelievably terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there was never been a Japanese </v>

4074
03:16:27.740 --> 03:16:28.380
<v Speaker 3>person that has that kind of physical </v>
<v Speaker 3>strength,</v>

4075
03:16:28.680 --> 03:16:33.680
<v Speaker 3>so I think it's limited genetically and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in a lot of the competitive </v>

4076
03:16:34.051 --> 03:16:39.051
<v Speaker 3>boxing countries that tend to be poor </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries and I think also in a lot of </v>

4077
03:16:39.051 --> 03:16:43.341
<v Speaker 3>poor countries you'll see much smaller </v>
<v Speaker 3>men like you'll see like some some </v>

4078
03:16:43.341 --> 03:16:46.350
<v Speaker 3>manner like flyweights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's very rare you find an American</v>

4079
03:16:46.351 --> 03:16:48.570
<v Speaker 3>flyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most Americans are larger.</v>

4080
03:16:48.571 --> 03:16:51.060
<v Speaker 3>They get more food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it probably has a lot to do with</v>

4081
03:16:51.061 --> 03:16:56.061
<v Speaker 3>it or just just the genetics in general.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like South America produces a lot of</v>

4082
03:16:56.360 --> 03:17:00.750
<v Speaker 3>flyweights like the Philippines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course we're manny Pacquiao came from</v>

4083
03:17:00.751 --> 03:17:05.751
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like eight weight classes lower </v>

4084
03:17:05.751 --> 03:17:07.851
<v Speaker 3>when he first started and if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>great athlete at at 120 pounds or 130 </v>

4085
03:17:07.851 --> 03:17:07.851
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>

4086
03:17:07.851 --> 03:17:09.300
<v Speaker 3>Not a lot of sports.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4087
03:17:09.301 --> 03:17:11.130
<v Speaker 3>What else can you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you read.</v>

4088
03:17:11.340 --> 03:17:14.730
<v Speaker 3>Some of these guys are really tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're amazing boxers,</v>

4089
03:17:14.970 --> 03:17:15.640
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4090
03:17:15.840 --> 03:17:18.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a ton of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the United States,</v>

4091
03:17:19.050 --> 03:17:24.050
<v Speaker 3>Johnny Tapio was a smaller guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what it would wait to Johnny </v>

4092
03:17:24.050 --> 03:17:28.640
<v Speaker 3>Tappia fight out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you find that there was some </v>

4093
03:17:28.640 --> 03:17:29.040
<v Speaker 3>lightweight guys that were just so </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredible.</v>

4094
03:17:29.041 --> 03:17:31.500
<v Speaker 3>They brought so much attention to those </v>
<v Speaker 3>divisions,</v>

4095
03:17:31.501 --> 03:17:36.501
<v Speaker 3>but there was never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is my little peaks and valleys </v>

4096
03:17:36.501 --> 03:17:37.130
<v Speaker 3>where greatness comes in and people have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to recover and the new people come along</v>

4097
03:17:37.131 --> 03:17:39.450
<v Speaker 3>with are great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's always been pretty steady.</v>

4098
03:17:40.280 --> 03:17:43.020
<v Speaker 3>What did he fight at?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super Flyway?</v>

4099
03:17:43.080 --> 03:17:45.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he was one of the rare Americans,</v>

4100
03:17:45.900 --> 03:17:50.900
<v Speaker 3>Mexican American Johnny Tap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a bad motherfucker super fly </v>

4101
03:17:50.900 --> 03:17:50.900
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is,</v>

4102
03:17:50.900 --> 03:17:52.590
<v Speaker 3>what is that like one slash 26 or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something?</v>

4103
03:17:52.650 --> 03:17:53.760
<v Speaker 3>Maybe 1:30.</v>

4104
03:17:56.010 --> 03:17:57.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what that [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bantam weight.</v>

4105
03:17:57.881 --> 03:17:59.880
<v Speaker 3>I think it's in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's different.</v>

4106
03:17:59.910 --> 03:18:03.660
<v Speaker 3>There's different weight classes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One hundred,</v>

4107
03:18:03.661 --> 03:18:05.490
<v Speaker 3>15 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

4108
03:18:05.910 --> 03:18:07.380
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was tiny.</v>

4109
03:18:07.430 --> 03:18:09.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was a wild,</v>

4110
03:18:09.691 --> 03:18:12.240
<v Speaker 3>wild guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did a documentary about him.</v>

4111
03:18:12.300 --> 03:18:13.650
<v Speaker 3>How did he do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He died.</v>

4112
03:18:13.790 --> 03:18:14.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he died.</v>

4113
03:18:15.690 --> 03:18:20.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he had a lot of problems with drugs </v>

4114
03:18:20.690 --> 03:18:24.351
<v Speaker 3>and crime and craziness and he had like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mi Vida loca tattooed on his chest.</v>

4115
03:18:27.200 --> 03:18:30.720
<v Speaker 3>I might get you to the presidency now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a wild man,</v>

4116
03:18:30.810 --> 03:18:33.960
<v Speaker 3>but just an amazing fighter to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So much fun.</v>

4117
03:18:34.080 --> 03:18:34.990
<v Speaker 3>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4118
03:18:35.540 --> 03:18:39.360
<v Speaker 3>put in where the bigger people are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4119
03:18:39.400 --> 03:18:44.400
<v Speaker 3>I just think they tend to gravitate </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards other sports and I think that's </v>

4120
03:18:44.400 --> 03:18:46.170
<v Speaker 3>all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And boxing like always like one 60,</v>

4121
03:18:46.171 --> 03:18:48.430
<v Speaker 3>1:47</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one [inaudible] always been like the</v>

4122
03:18:48.431 --> 03:18:53.431
<v Speaker 3>promised land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's sugar ray Leonard and Marvin </v>

4123
03:18:53.431 --> 03:18:53.431
<v Speaker 3>Hagler.</v>

4124
03:18:53.431 --> 03:18:53.890
<v Speaker 3>Roberto Duran.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a floyd mayweather's in there.</v>

4125
03:18:53.891 --> 03:18:55.270
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shane Mosley's in there.</v>

4126
03:18:55.300 --> 03:18:58.780
<v Speaker 3>So many guys are in that mix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the sweet spot.</v>

4127
03:18:58.910 --> 03:19:03.250
<v Speaker 3>That's always has been this great </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighters in pretty much every class.</v>

4128
03:19:03.360 --> 03:19:05.580
<v Speaker 3>Strength and speed that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4129
03:19:05.770 --> 03:19:08.170
<v Speaker 3>I think you see in the UFC to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's um,</v>

4130
03:19:08.550 --> 03:19:13.550
<v Speaker 3>well I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well when it comes to just freak </v>

4131
03:19:13.550 --> 03:19:16.351
<v Speaker 3>movements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always think that the flyweights in </v>

4132
03:19:16.351 --> 03:19:16.351
<v Speaker 3>the Bantam weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's 25 and 35,</v>

4133
03:19:16.351 --> 03:19:18.790
<v Speaker 3>so the fastest and the best coding like </v>
<v Speaker 3>20 percent faster than.</v>

4134
03:19:19.050 --> 03:19:20.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I always wonder like,</v>

4135
03:19:20.531 --> 03:19:25.531
<v Speaker 3>how much of that is because they're just</v>
<v Speaker 3>not affected by gravity as much because </v>

4136
03:19:25.531 --> 03:19:29.051
<v Speaker 3>that was effected by the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the blows that are being landed by the </v>

4137
03:19:29.051 --> 03:19:29.051
<v Speaker 3>other guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

4138
03:19:29.051 --> 03:19:30.160
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless it's mighty mouse.</v>

4139
03:19:30.370 --> 03:19:34.060
<v Speaker 3>Mighty mouse is the one of the few guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>in that division that consistently stops</v>

4140
03:19:34.061 --> 03:19:39.061
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you see his last fight with Henry </v>

4141
03:19:39.061 --> 03:19:39.061
<v Speaker 3>Cejudo?</v>

4142
03:19:39.061 --> 03:19:39.061
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

4143
03:19:39.061 --> 03:19:40.390
<v Speaker 3>it was incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was insane.</v>

4144
03:19:40.690 --> 03:19:41.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

4145
03:19:41.351 --> 03:19:42.910
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he fought this Guy Henry,</v>

4146
03:19:42.911 --> 03:19:47.911
<v Speaker 3>so who does an Olympic gold medalist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the best wrestlers to ever </v>

4147
03:19:47.911 --> 03:19:47.911
<v Speaker 3>compete in MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4148
03:19:47.911 --> 03:19:50.140
<v Speaker 3>he is just a stud wrestler and a really </v>
<v Speaker 3>good kickboxer too.</v>

4149
03:19:50.590 --> 03:19:55.590
<v Speaker 3>And mighty mouse clenched up with them </v>
<v Speaker 3>and hit them with these knees to the </v>

4150
03:19:55.590 --> 03:19:57.700
<v Speaker 3>body that we're just out of this world </v>
<v Speaker 3>technical.</v>

4151
03:19:57.730 --> 03:19:59.810
<v Speaker 3>Just so perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No wind up,</v>

4152
03:19:59.811 --> 03:20:04.811
<v Speaker 3>no slop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just drilled them in on each side with </v>

4153
03:20:04.811 --> 03:20:05.440
<v Speaker 3>perfect precision and he just crumbled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

4154
03:20:05.441 --> 03:20:08.950
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got the victory on knees to the body,</v>

4155
03:20:08.980 --> 03:20:12.400
<v Speaker 3>just need the shit out of his body and </v>
<v Speaker 3>eat them in the face.</v>

4156
03:20:12.670 --> 03:20:17.670
<v Speaker 3>But it was the fluidity of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who is moving his knees in the perfect </v>

4157
03:20:17.670 --> 03:20:18.280
<v Speaker 3>position?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4158
03:20:19.060 --> 03:20:22.240
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were so perfectly oiled,</v>

4159
03:20:22.450 --> 03:20:25.930
<v Speaker 3>like everything was going down a path </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it had gotten a million times,</v>

4160
03:20:25.940 --> 03:20:28.320
<v Speaker 3>which just like a tight clench or.</v>

4161
03:20:28.360 --> 03:20:29.320
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was,</v>

4162
03:20:29.560 --> 03:20:30.820
<v Speaker 3>it was better than I've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4163
03:20:30.930 --> 03:20:33.840
<v Speaker 3>it was without a doubt the most.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the most.</v>

4164
03:20:33.880 --> 03:20:38.880
<v Speaker 3>Well there's two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's another one in between Anderson </v>

4165
03:20:38.880 --> 03:20:41.220
<v Speaker 3>Silva and rich Franklin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was like a prolong brutal beat </v>

4166
03:20:41.220 --> 03:20:41.860
<v Speaker 3>down where Anderson just keep beating </v>
<v Speaker 3>him up,</v>

4167
03:20:41.950 --> 03:20:43.780
<v Speaker 3>beating him up in the clench and broke </v>
<v Speaker 3>his nose.</v>

4168
03:20:43.880 --> 03:20:45.890
<v Speaker 3>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's one where uh,</v>

4169
03:20:47.110 --> 03:20:47.720
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

4170
03:20:47.721 --> 03:20:50.290
<v Speaker 3>I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember victor was at Wildman or,</v>

4171
03:20:50.350 --> 03:20:55.350
<v Speaker 3>or was it silver?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember if someone just won on </v>

4172
03:20:55.350 --> 03:20:57.010
<v Speaker 3>a knee to the chest against someone who </v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

4173
03:20:57.070 --> 03:20:58.540
<v Speaker 3>Can you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you need someone who's,</v>

4174
03:20:59.020 --> 03:21:00.450
<v Speaker 3>who's down?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was jail son and.</v>

4175
03:21:00.460 --> 03:21:01.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anderson Silva.</v>

4176
03:21:01.620 --> 03:21:02.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4177
03:21:02.390 --> 03:21:02.860
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

4178
03:21:02.861 --> 03:21:04.550
<v Speaker 3>That was pretty brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

4179
03:21:04.930 --> 03:21:07.580
<v Speaker 3>what mighty mouse did in this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was crazy.</v>

4180
03:21:07.581 --> 03:21:11.170
<v Speaker 3>It was the precision of the placement of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the knees and how quick they came.</v>

4181
03:21:11.170 --> 03:21:12.250
<v Speaker 3>Just Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bam,</v>

4182
03:21:12.251 --> 03:21:12.730
<v Speaker 3>Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bam.</v>

4183
03:21:12.731 --> 03:21:14.420
<v Speaker 3>Just controlled him and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>controlling.</v>

4184
03:21:14.421 --> 03:21:16.330
<v Speaker 3>Your guy was an Olympic gold medalist </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestler,</v>

4185
03:21:16.331 --> 03:21:19.510
<v Speaker 3>just a stud wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was really pretty impressive stuff.</v>

4186
03:21:19.511 --> 03:21:22.120
<v Speaker 3>Like really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really amazing sharp technique.</v>

4187
03:21:22.330 --> 03:21:24.400
<v Speaker 3>But I wonder what could a heavyweight </v>
<v Speaker 3>even move like that?</v>

4188
03:21:25.230 --> 03:21:26.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably not.</v>

4189
03:21:26.270 --> 03:21:26.650
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4190
03:21:26.680 --> 03:21:30.040
<v Speaker 3>as you get bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are just things you can't do.</v>

4191
03:21:30.090 --> 03:21:35.090
<v Speaker 3>It clearly is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a limit to the size you can be </v>

4192
03:21:36.700 --> 03:21:40.390
<v Speaker 3>and be not only athletic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but even ambulatory.</v>

4193
03:21:40.450 --> 03:21:40.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>

4194
03:21:40.961 --> 03:21:44.050
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't have a 30 foot tall person </v>
<v Speaker 3>who could walk around and,</v>

4195
03:21:44.430 --> 03:21:45.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your bones would break and,</v>

4196
03:21:45.921 --> 03:21:46.090
<v Speaker 3>you</v>

4197
03:21:46.220 --> 03:21:48.140
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because because mass goes up,</v>

4198
03:21:48.190 --> 03:21:50.750
<v Speaker 2>but with a cube of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4199
03:21:51.530 --> 03:21:54.120
<v Speaker 2>just the side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's why it's why if you,</v>

4200
03:21:54.140 --> 03:21:59.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a part of ammunition that kind of a </v>

4201
03:21:59.140 --> 03:21:59.160
<v Speaker 2>different point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like if you,</v>

4202
03:21:59.190 --> 03:22:03.590
<v Speaker 2>if you could drop an ant off the empire </v>
<v Speaker 2>state building and it'll,</v>

4203
03:22:04.280 --> 03:22:09.280
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll fall and hit the ground and be </v>

4204
03:22:09.280 --> 03:22:12.101
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you dropped a horse off the empire </v>

4205
03:22:12.101 --> 03:22:12.101
<v Speaker 2>state building,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to,</v>

4206
03:22:12.101 --> 03:22:12.101
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be illiquid horse.</v>

4207
03:22:12.101 --> 03:22:13.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

4208
03:22:13.371 --> 03:22:14.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they are,</v>

4209
03:22:14.620 --> 03:22:15.460
<v Speaker 2>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4210
03:22:15.520 --> 03:22:19.010
<v Speaker 2>kind of the air resistance with surface </v>
<v Speaker 2>area,</v>

4211
03:22:20.990 --> 03:22:21.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4212
03:22:21.860 --> 03:22:23.680
<v Speaker 2>the air resistance goes up with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>

4213
03:22:23.730 --> 03:22:26.360
<v Speaker 2>by the square,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the surface area,</v>

4214
03:22:26.600 --> 03:22:30.650
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't counteract for the mass</v>

4215
03:22:30.651 --> 03:22:32.420
<v Speaker 2>going up with a cube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the volume.</v>

4216
03:22:32.440 --> 03:22:34.880
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the horse is bigger,</v>

4217
03:22:34.881 --> 03:22:39.881
<v Speaker 2>you'd think it might be able to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>act like a wing more as much as the </v>

4218
03:22:39.881 --> 03:22:39.881
<v Speaker 2>atwood.</v>

4219
03:22:39.881 --> 03:22:41.270
<v Speaker 2>He has got a lot of air resistance is </v>
<v Speaker 2>giant.</v>

4220
03:22:41.271 --> 03:22:43.010
<v Speaker 2>It's always a horse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

4221
03:22:43.011 --> 03:22:44.350
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4222
03:22:44.480 --> 03:22:46.850
<v Speaker 2>it's mass is going up with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a cube of.</v>

4223
03:22:46.851 --> 03:22:50.180
<v Speaker 2>It's with the cube of its size.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's um,</v>

4224
03:22:51.010 --> 03:22:56.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the air doesn't resist this fall at all </v>

4225
03:22:56.010 --> 03:22:56.010
<v Speaker 2>compared to them what it's doing for an </v>
<v Speaker 2>end.</v>

4226
03:22:56.660 --> 03:22:57.420
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

4227
03:22:57.421 --> 03:22:59.240
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we haven't the limit on this.</v>

4228
03:22:59.270 --> 03:23:01.220
<v Speaker 2>This is one function,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you,</v>

4229
03:23:01.250 --> 03:23:06.250
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to engineer the super </v>
<v Speaker 2>athlete and if we're going to give you </v>

4230
03:23:06.250 --> 03:23:09.791
<v Speaker 2>like a chimpanzee muscle proteins or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever to make you super explosive and</v>

4231
03:23:09.951 --> 03:23:11.660
<v Speaker 2>strong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4232
03:23:12.140 --> 03:23:13.820
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to get that right with your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4233
03:23:13.821 --> 03:23:18.821
<v Speaker 2>your connective tissue and your bones </v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything else because you could </v>

4234
03:23:18.821 --> 03:23:19.720
<v Speaker 2>rip your own arm off with your holistic </v>
<v Speaker 2>moves.</v>

4235
03:23:22.110 --> 03:23:27.110
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if you had chimps strength and </v>
<v Speaker 2>human tendencies like good luck once you</v>

4236
03:23:28.431 --> 03:23:30.950
<v Speaker 2>take your own arm off and beat the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person with it.</v>

4237
03:23:31.630 --> 03:23:36.630
<v Speaker 2>Well use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you saw that video of the </v>

4238
03:23:36.630 --> 03:23:36.630
<v Speaker 2>little boy who got into the gorilla </v>
<v Speaker 2>cage.</v>

4239
03:23:36.630 --> 03:23:38.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shoot the gorilla.</v>

4240
03:23:39.260 --> 03:23:41.270
<v Speaker 2>That seemed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard a lot of.</v>

4241
03:23:41.271 --> 03:23:43.460
<v Speaker 2>I didn't pay a lot of attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>commentary,</v>

4242
03:23:43.461 --> 03:23:47.030
<v Speaker 2>but it seemed pretty straightforward to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

4243
03:23:47.210 --> 03:23:48.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to shoot the gorilla.</v>

4244
03:23:48.651 --> 03:23:51.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm with the zoo on that one.</v>

4245
03:23:51.231 --> 03:23:54.620
<v Speaker 2>I missed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally tragic and it's how is the zoo?</v>

4246
03:23:55.160 --> 03:24:00.160
<v Speaker 2>The zoo was certainly culpable for </v>
<v Speaker 2>having an enclosure that a three year </v>

4247
03:24:00.160 --> 03:24:02.030
<v Speaker 2>old or four year old can get into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4248
03:24:02.031 --> 03:24:03.020
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the hell did that happen?</v>

4249
03:24:03.021 --> 03:24:06.440
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've got to fix that and um,</v>

4250
03:24:06.650 --> 03:24:11.650
<v Speaker 2>but it's totally tragic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once you have a 400 pound gorilla </v>

4251
03:24:11.650 --> 03:24:15.191
<v Speaker 2>that has a human child and is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>letting it go and just kind of dragging </v>

4252
03:24:15.921 --> 03:24:17.280
<v Speaker 2>it around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4253
03:24:17.320 --> 03:24:19.190
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't looking at aggressive toward </v>
<v Speaker 2>the child,</v>

4254
03:24:19.191 --> 03:24:21.350
<v Speaker 2>but it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that it moved it around,</v>

4255
03:24:21.351 --> 03:24:24.950
<v Speaker 2>would that kind of force who then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows what was going to happen?</v>

4256
03:24:24.950 --> 03:24:29.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looked like you had to end that as </v>

4257
03:24:29.950 --> 03:24:32.531
<v Speaker 2>quickly as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to assume that that girl is </v>

4258
03:24:32.531 --> 03:24:32.930
<v Speaker 2>going to know that a baby's more fragile</v>
<v Speaker 2>than a baby gorilla.</v>

4259
03:24:33.080 --> 03:24:34.910
<v Speaker 2>We'd have to assume.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't assume anything.</v>

4260
03:24:34.950 --> 03:24:36.080
<v Speaker 2>You can't say no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

4261
03:24:36.081 --> 03:24:41.081
<v Speaker 2>There's no way I could know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never experienced that have just </v>

4262
03:24:41.081 --> 03:24:42.710
<v Speaker 2>ripped or torn his head off easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Accidentally.</v>

4263
03:24:42.770 --> 03:24:43.680
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Easily.</v>

4264
03:24:44.210 --> 03:24:45.510
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was totally tragic.</v>

4265
03:24:45.660 --> 03:24:47.870
<v Speaker 3>And I'm sure the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4266
03:24:47.880 --> 03:24:52.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the parents and this and the zoo are </v>

4267
03:24:52.880 --> 03:24:54.440
<v Speaker 3>reaping sufficient criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

4268
03:24:54.720 --> 03:24:57.870
<v Speaker 3>once that situation is unfolding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

4269
03:24:57.960 --> 03:25:02.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't tranquilizer because it </v>

4270
03:25:02.960 --> 03:25:04.580
<v Speaker 3>doesn't work fast enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I might grab a,</v>

4271
03:25:04.790 --> 03:25:08.400
<v Speaker 3>a fear and it's being attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

4272
03:25:08.401 --> 03:25:10.440
<v Speaker 3>That's scary though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if it was your kid,</v>

4273
03:25:10.740 --> 03:25:15.360
<v Speaker 3>I think he'd probably shoot that fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>gorilla if it was your kid.</v>

4274
03:25:15.910 --> 03:25:18.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's um.</v>

4275
03:25:18.290 --> 03:25:23.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean if more people were carrying guns</v>
<v Speaker 3>you where it was in Cincinnati,</v>

4276
03:25:23.071 --> 03:25:28.071
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that had been in Texas a property </v>

4277
03:25:28.071 --> 03:25:29.160
<v Speaker 3>with some innocent bystander who was </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to take the law into his own hands</v>

4278
03:25:29.170 --> 03:25:34.170
<v Speaker 3>and Chuck Norris plants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm prayed over the open fire.</v>

4279
03:25:36.900 --> 03:25:38.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

4280
03:25:38.820 --> 03:25:43.820
<v Speaker 3>I saw some horrible comments to where </v>
<v Speaker 3>people like they should just shot the </v>

4281
03:25:43.820 --> 03:25:44.460
<v Speaker 3>parents while they were at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

4282
03:25:44.490 --> 03:25:46.560
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's easy to be outraged.</v>

4283
03:25:46.560 --> 03:25:48.900
<v Speaker 3>Somebody fucked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a little kid.</v>

4284
03:25:49.350 --> 03:25:54.350
<v Speaker 3>Shouldn't have been able to get in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all this you gotta see gorilla </v>

4285
03:25:54.350 --> 03:25:54.720
<v Speaker 3>and closure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is an architectural failing.</v>

4286
03:25:54.800 --> 03:25:56.310
<v Speaker 3>They should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it should be impossible.</v>

4287
03:25:56.550 --> 03:26:01.550
<v Speaker 3>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just like a year old could do </v>

4288
03:26:01.550 --> 03:26:01.550
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How could a three year old,</v>

4289
03:26:01.550 --> 03:26:03.970
<v Speaker 3>like it should be impossible for an </v>
<v Speaker 3>adult to get in there with it,</v>

4290
03:26:04.010 --> 03:26:09.010
<v Speaker 3>with a gorilla would have been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been happening with like pretty </v>

4291
03:26:09.010 --> 03:26:13.941
<v Speaker 3>regularly lately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like guys had been breaking into zoos </v>

4292
03:26:13.941 --> 03:26:14.970
<v Speaker 3>and it's like some guy tried to kill the</v>
<v Speaker 3>lions recently,</v>

4293
03:26:15.070 --> 03:26:17.250
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

4294
03:26:17.251 --> 03:26:22.251
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta realize you gotta a lot of </v>

4295
03:26:22.251 --> 03:26:22.251
<v Speaker 3>responsibility when you have monsters in</v>
<v Speaker 3>occasion,</v>

4296
03:26:22.251 --> 03:26:26.150
<v Speaker 3>your city,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't let babies get in there with </v>

4297
03:26:26.150 --> 03:26:26.150
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4298
03:26:26.150 --> 03:26:27.390
<v Speaker 3>that's a gorilla as awesome as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if it wanted to attack you,</v>

4299
03:26:27.450 --> 03:26:32.450
<v Speaker 3>it's a monstrous beast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a thing with power that you </v>

4300
03:26:32.761 --> 03:26:34.110
<v Speaker 3>couldn't even fathom.</v>

4301
03:26:34.410 --> 03:26:37.680
<v Speaker 3>A gorilla could literally pick you up </v>
<v Speaker 3>and throw you.</v>

4302
03:26:37.681 --> 03:26:39.900
<v Speaker 3>Like you could have football.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4303
03:26:39.901 --> 03:26:43.020
<v Speaker 3>they can launch you there is so strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

4304
03:26:43.200 --> 03:26:43.880
<v Speaker 3>don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't we?</v>

4305
03:26:43.980 --> 03:26:48.980
<v Speaker 3>Google it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get to be like 500 pounds or </v>

4306
03:26:48.980 --> 03:26:48.980
<v Speaker 3>something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4307
03:26:48.980 --> 03:26:50.210
<v Speaker 3>Well this was like 400 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not,</v>

4308
03:26:50.250 --> 03:26:52.380
<v Speaker 3>but not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Four hundred pounds,</v>

4309
03:26:52.381 --> 03:26:57.381
<v Speaker 3>like a Boston sap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Four hundred pounds when he was 300 </v>

4310
03:26:57.381 --> 03:27:00.861
<v Speaker 3>pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like a 300 pound gorilla is </v>

4311
03:27:00.861 --> 03:27:01.150
<v Speaker 3>much stronger than Bob Sapp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4312
03:27:02.000 --> 03:27:05.460
<v Speaker 3>They're not equivalent pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's unfathomable.</v>

4313
03:27:05.790 --> 03:27:10.790
<v Speaker 3>The amount of physical strength and must</v>
<v Speaker 3>just sucks that they keep them in zoos </v>

4314
03:27:10.790 --> 03:27:13.200
<v Speaker 3>in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sucks that they had to kill him,</v>

4315
03:27:13.590 --> 03:27:17.040
<v Speaker 3>but it really sucks that they keep doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>the zoo thing with smart stuff,</v>

4316
03:27:17.550 --> 03:27:19.350
<v Speaker 3>like if you want to have giraffes in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>zoo.</v>

4317
03:27:19.590 --> 03:27:24.590
<v Speaker 3>And I had a whole bit about it that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>look like real relaxed because there's </v>

4318
03:27:24.590 --> 03:27:24.590
<v Speaker 3>no lions around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4319
03:27:24.590 --> 03:27:26.070
<v Speaker 3>like they don't care,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just give them some food.</v>

4320
03:27:26.400 --> 03:27:31.400
<v Speaker 3>But there's some animals that look </v>
<v Speaker 3>tortured and primates in particular,</v>

4321
03:27:31.860 --> 03:27:36.860
<v Speaker 3>they just look so freaked out in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>enclosure and this weird place where </v>

4322
03:27:36.860 --> 03:27:41.571
<v Speaker 3>people are staring at them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're pacing and trying to get away </v>

4323
03:27:41.571 --> 03:27:41.571
<v Speaker 3>from people's gazes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

4324
03:27:41.571 --> 03:27:42.070
<v Speaker 3>I think it's very,</v>

4325
03:27:42.070 --> 03:27:43.720
<v Speaker 2>very stressful to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

4326
03:27:43.770 --> 03:27:46.780
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a hard question,</v>

4327
03:27:47.130 --> 03:27:52.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what to do given certainly these </v>

4328
03:27:52.130 --> 03:27:53.020
<v Speaker 2>species or are on the verge of </v>
<v Speaker 2>extinction.</v>

4329
03:27:53.050 --> 03:27:54.910
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like how do you preserve them?</v>

4330
03:27:55.570 --> 03:28:00.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you obviously you can preserve them in </v>

4331
03:28:00.570 --> 03:28:00.570
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of technical ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

4332
03:28:00.570 --> 03:28:00.570
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4333
03:28:00.570 --> 03:28:05.460
<v Speaker 2>have their DNA frozen and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and be able to reboot them at a certain </v>

4334
03:28:05.460 --> 03:28:05.710
<v Speaker 2>point when we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we haven't,</v>

4335
03:28:06.940 --> 03:28:09.100
<v Speaker 2>when we figured out how to preserve </v>
<v Speaker 2>their habitat.</v>

4336
03:28:09.101 --> 03:28:10.490
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4337
03:28:11.710 --> 03:28:12.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4338
03:28:12.261 --> 03:28:14.230
<v Speaker 2>I think that I got to think there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>role for,</v>

4339
03:28:14.470 --> 03:28:17.080
<v Speaker 2>for good zoos to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get it because you also,</v>

4340
03:28:17.081 --> 03:28:22.081
<v Speaker 2>you just want to maintain the public's </v>
<v Speaker 2>connection to these animals because the </v>

4341
03:28:22.781 --> 03:28:27.781
<v Speaker 2>decision to destroy habitat is made by </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who don't really care about the </v>

4342
03:28:30.370 --> 03:28:31.840
<v Speaker 2>prospects of extinction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4343
03:28:32.290 --> 03:28:37.290
<v Speaker 2>It's a very good point when you present </v>
<v Speaker 2>it that way because the people that are </v>

4344
03:28:37.290 --> 03:28:40.141
<v Speaker 2>over there are face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the people that are over in </v>

4345
03:28:40.141 --> 03:28:43.171
<v Speaker 2>Africa trying to save gorillas and </v>
<v Speaker 2>chimps and I mean that is an </v>

4346
03:28:43.171 --> 03:28:47.251
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably difficult struggle and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>might not make it when there's a real </v>

4347
03:28:47.251 --> 03:28:51.241
<v Speaker 2>concern that if there was no regulation </v>
<v Speaker 2>at all and there was no one telling </v>

4348
03:28:51.241 --> 03:28:53.770
<v Speaker 2>anybody what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they could just go in there and wipe</v>

4349
03:28:53.771 --> 03:28:54.310
<v Speaker 2>them all out.</v>

4350
03:28:54.460 --> 03:28:59.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's mean historically that's what </v>

4351
03:28:59.460 --> 03:28:59.460
<v Speaker 2>we've done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4352
03:28:59.460 --> 03:28:59.460
<v Speaker 2>So if any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with kind of everything that we profited</v>

4353
03:28:59.460 --> 03:29:02.200
<v Speaker 2>from anything that you can make money </v>
<v Speaker 2>off of anything that you can.</v>

4354
03:29:02.570 --> 03:29:03.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4355
03:29:03.400 --> 03:29:06.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the hell they use </v>
<v Speaker 2>chimps and gorillas for.</v>

4356
03:29:07.330 --> 03:29:09.720
<v Speaker 2>Well there's the whole trade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4357
03:29:09.721 --> 03:29:09.990
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

4358
03:29:10.090 --> 03:29:11.890
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's bushmeat they eat them,</v>

4359
03:29:12.170 --> 03:29:14.650
<v Speaker 2>but then there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do they call it bushmeat?</v>

4360
03:29:14.960 --> 03:29:16.150
<v Speaker 2>Well there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go into the Bush,</v>

4361
03:29:16.151 --> 03:29:19.030
<v Speaker 2>you go into it's content,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just shoot everything.</v>

4362
03:29:19.390 --> 03:29:19.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

4363
03:29:19.900 --> 03:29:22.690
<v Speaker 2>it's just your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're hunting species that you know,</v>

4364
03:29:22.930 --> 03:29:25.770
<v Speaker 2>you don't think of is food species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're,</v>

4365
03:29:25.840 --> 03:29:27.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're eating monkeys and gorillas and,</v>

4366
03:29:27.970 --> 03:29:29.580
<v Speaker 2>and that's why they call it bushmeat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4367
03:29:29.590 --> 03:29:30.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bushes.</v>

4368
03:29:30.460 --> 03:29:35.200
<v Speaker 2>They call bushes like the jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's um,</v>

4369
03:29:36.040 --> 03:29:38.400
<v Speaker 2>it's just hunting species that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are,</v>

4370
03:29:38.450 --> 03:29:39.520
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>

4371
03:29:39.530 --> 03:29:40.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4372
03:29:40.480 --> 03:29:43.900
<v Speaker 2>there's the other component of it which </v>
<v Speaker 2>is they're like,</v>

4373
03:29:43.910 --> 03:29:44.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4374
03:29:44.400 --> 03:29:49.400
<v Speaker 2>the crazy ideas that the Chinese have </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the medicinal properties of tiger </v>

4375
03:29:49.400 --> 03:29:49.960
<v Speaker 2>bone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wine writer,</v>

4376
03:29:49.961 --> 03:29:54.961
<v Speaker 2>Rhino Horn or so let's say you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>these species that are being hunted by </v>

4377
03:29:54.961 --> 03:29:56.810
<v Speaker 2>poachers because there's a market for </v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

4378
03:29:56.811 --> 03:29:58.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their parts,</v>

4379
03:29:58.810 --> 03:30:00.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4380
03:30:00.070 --> 03:30:02.200
<v Speaker 2>like I the ivory trade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

4381
03:30:02.201 --> 03:30:03.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

4382
03:30:03.160 --> 03:30:08.160
<v Speaker 2>but some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people just eat species that are </v>

4383
03:30:08.160 --> 03:30:10.591
<v Speaker 2>endangered to just the deterrent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bushmeat is always associated with </v>

4384
03:30:10.591 --> 03:30:11.560
<v Speaker 2>primates for some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was always trying to figure out why.</v>

4385
03:30:12.210 --> 03:30:13.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that true?</v>

4386
03:30:13.750 --> 03:30:15.160
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably not.</v>

4387
03:30:15.390 --> 03:30:20.390
<v Speaker 2>Maybe my mind was when I read about </v>
<v Speaker 2>people eating chips and how common it </v>

4388
03:30:21.251 --> 03:30:26.251
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend Steve Rinella did a show in </v>

4389
03:30:26.251 --> 03:30:29.701
<v Speaker 2>Bolivia where they shot and they ate a </v>
<v Speaker 2>monkey and it's so weird to watch these </v>

4390
03:30:31.541 --> 03:30:35.140
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yanomami the Yanomami,</v>

4391
03:30:35.480 --> 03:30:40.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they live in Bolivia and they live in </v>

4392
03:30:40.480 --> 03:30:41.690
<v Speaker 2>very much like the way they probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>live hundreds of years ago.</v>

4393
03:30:41.690 --> 03:30:46.690
<v Speaker 2>They are handmade bows and arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's long spear like arrows that it's </v>

4394
03:30:46.690 --> 03:30:50.750
<v Speaker 2>not like a regular bone marrow that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a five foot long arrow restraint.</v>

4395
03:30:51.110 --> 03:30:55.640
<v Speaker 2>They walk around barefoot and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have some Russian shotgun and their</v>

4396
03:30:55.641 --> 03:30:58.490
<v Speaker 2>favorite thing to do is they have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russian shotgun.</v>

4397
03:30:58.600 --> 03:31:03.600
<v Speaker 2>The other got a Russian shotgun and </v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow they got from somebody and it </v>

4398
03:31:03.600 --> 03:31:03.800
<v Speaker 2>made it all the way deep into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>jungle.</v>

4399
03:31:03.810 --> 03:31:08.810
<v Speaker 2>But the shelves are very precious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But their favorite thing to do is shoot </v>

4400
03:31:08.810 --> 03:31:12.131
<v Speaker 2>an eat monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like their number one favorite </v>

4401
03:31:12.131 --> 03:31:14.321
<v Speaker 2>thing to eat and they cooked it on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>show and it was really weird to watch.</v>

4402
03:31:14.990 --> 03:31:19.310
<v Speaker 2>You talk about some strange genetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>connection that you have with a very,</v>

4403
03:31:19.730 --> 03:31:24.730
<v Speaker 2>very human shape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the lips and the eyes and the face </v>

4404
03:31:24.730 --> 03:31:28.271
<v Speaker 2>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can recognize a certain amount of </v>

4405
03:31:28.271 --> 03:31:31.361
<v Speaker 2>human in that little little fella when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are fellow female,</v>

4406
03:31:31.430 --> 03:31:33.350
<v Speaker 2>whatever female version of fellow would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

4407
03:31:33.800 --> 03:31:34.740
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they,</v>

4408
03:31:34.741 --> 03:31:38.810
<v Speaker 2>they cooked it over this fire and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>made this stew out of it.</v>

4409
03:31:39.340 --> 03:31:41.510
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4410
03:31:41.570 --> 03:31:43.400
<v Speaker 2>actually to go back to our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4411
03:31:44.090 --> 03:31:49.090
<v Speaker 2>cultured meat conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing that's weird about that </v>

4412
03:31:49.090 --> 03:31:50.030
<v Speaker 2>prospect is that if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

4413
03:31:50.031 --> 03:31:53.070
<v Speaker 2>so if you're making,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're growing cells in a vat,</v>

4414
03:31:53.630 --> 03:31:56.570
<v Speaker 2>then there's no problem with </v>
<v Speaker 2>cannibalism,</v>

4415
03:31:57.020 --> 03:32:02.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that you could be growing human meat </v>

4416
03:32:02.020 --> 03:32:02.020
<v Speaker 2>and fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4417
03:32:02.020 --> 03:32:02.570
<v Speaker 2>That's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's zero ethical problem,</v>

4418
03:32:02.600 --> 03:32:07.040
<v Speaker 2>but it's just as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as rote task is as a,</v>

4419
03:32:07.970 --> 03:32:12.970
<v Speaker 2>at least to my palate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has fairly grotesque thing to </v>

4420
03:32:12.970 --> 03:32:16.931
<v Speaker 2>contemplate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But these are just the distinction I'm </v>

4421
03:32:16.931 --> 03:32:16.931
<v Speaker 2>just talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4422
03:32:16.931 --> 03:32:18.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no in principle,</v>

4423
03:32:18.681 --> 03:32:21.200
<v Speaker 2>human DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4424
03:32:21.201 --> 03:32:23.150
<v Speaker 2>And this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at the cellular level,</v>

4425
03:32:23.750 --> 03:32:24.640
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4426
03:32:24.760 --> 03:32:26.300
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4427
03:32:27.090 --> 03:32:32.090
<v Speaker 2>the difference between human muscle </v>
<v Speaker 2>protein and bovine muscle protein is not</v>

4428
03:32:33.831 --> 03:32:34.900
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's if this,</v>

4429
03:32:34.940 --> 03:32:38.600
<v Speaker 2>if this was never attached to an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a.</v>

4430
03:32:39.350 --> 03:32:42.100
<v Speaker 2>we're dealing with concepts here and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like when you,</v>

4431
03:32:42.280 --> 03:32:47.280
<v Speaker 2>if you bite a fingernail and swallow it </v>
<v Speaker 2>or you are practicing auto cannibalism,</v>

4432
03:32:47.961 --> 03:32:48.900
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

4433
03:32:48.930 --> 03:32:49.490
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

4434
03:32:54.050 --> 03:32:57.020
<v Speaker 2>at some level it is a concept is doing a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of work.</v>

4435
03:32:57.050 --> 03:33:01.010
<v Speaker 2>It's uninsurable when you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about depriving another person of life.</v>

4436
03:33:01.070 --> 03:33:03.480
<v Speaker 2>But if you're talking about spinning up </v>
<v Speaker 2>sells in a Vat,</v>

4437
03:33:03.500 --> 03:33:04.850
<v Speaker 2>then then it becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4438
03:33:05.300 --> 03:33:08.900
<v Speaker 2>does it really matter whether this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was a person,</v>

4439
03:33:08.940 --> 03:33:13.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe people would decide that would be </v>

4440
03:33:13.940 --> 03:33:13.940
<v Speaker 2>the only ethical choice to hasten </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultured human meat.</v>

4441
03:33:13.940 --> 03:33:15.980
<v Speaker 2>If you can eat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to eat human meat.</v>

4442
03:33:15.981 --> 03:33:20.981
<v Speaker 2>There's the end of this economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't harm any other animals.</v>

4443
03:33:21.081 --> 03:33:22.850
<v Speaker 2>Not only can you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to eat yourself.</v>

4444
03:33:22.910 --> 03:33:26.870
<v Speaker 2>This is what the cattle industry could </v>
<v Speaker 2>do to just quash this.</v>

4445
03:33:26.871 --> 03:33:31.871
<v Speaker 2>That just spread the rumor that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are human cells and those vats and you </v>

4446
03:33:31.871 --> 03:33:35.260
<v Speaker 2>go to your local center,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get scraped and then they start </v>

4447
03:33:35.260 --> 03:33:37.710
<v Speaker 2>making your monthly supply of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Soylent Green is people</v>

4448
03:33:38.760 --> 03:33:42.870
<v Speaker 3>and they just have it in a vat and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>break you off a cube every week.</v>

4449
03:33:43.750 --> 03:33:48.750
<v Speaker 3>He'd take it back to you and you eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself and that's the only meat you </v>

4450
03:33:49.191 --> 03:33:54.191
<v Speaker 3>were allowed to eat yourself while we </v>
<v Speaker 3>figured out a way to live in harmony </v>

4451
03:33:54.191 --> 03:33:57.471
<v Speaker 3>with nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just have to kill everything except </v>

4452
03:33:57.471 --> 03:33:59.541
<v Speaker 3>us and then eat ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell us which part of your own body you </v>

4453
03:33:59.541 --> 03:34:00.950
<v Speaker 3>want to eat for the rest of your life </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we will culture themselves.</v>

4454
03:34:01.230 --> 03:34:02.460
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it was you that I was having this</v>

4455
03:34:02.461 --> 03:34:07.461
<v Speaker 3>conversation with once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe where we were talking about </v>

4456
03:34:07.461 --> 03:34:09.390
<v Speaker 3>how when areas become more educated and </v>
<v Speaker 3>women become more educated,</v>

4457
03:34:09.391 --> 03:34:13.620
<v Speaker 3>it tends to slow the population down </v>
<v Speaker 3>like people tend to.</v>

4458
03:34:13.630 --> 03:34:18.630
<v Speaker 3>They tend to even worry that if these </v>
<v Speaker 3>graphs continue further on that people </v>

4459
03:34:19.350 --> 03:34:24.350
<v Speaker 3>in industrialized parts of the world as </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the they get into the first </v>

4460
03:34:24.350 --> 03:34:25.560
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they do,</v>

4461
03:34:25.890 --> 03:34:27.970
<v Speaker 3>they'll more likely to have less and </v>
<v Speaker 3>less people.</v>

4462
03:34:28.010 --> 03:34:33.010
<v Speaker 2>Paul has less and less children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fertility goes down with literacy and </v>

4463
03:34:33.010 --> 03:34:35.320
<v Speaker 2>education with among women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4464
03:34:35.870 --> 03:34:37.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's know.</v>

4465
03:34:37.460 --> 03:34:40.630
<v Speaker 2>So just to kind of map that onto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4466
03:34:40.631 --> 03:34:41.380
<v Speaker 2>life is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4467
03:34:41.381 --> 03:34:45.850
<v Speaker 2>adheres is a women given all the choices</v>
<v Speaker 2>available,</v>

4468
03:34:45.920 --> 03:34:50.920
<v Speaker 2>know educational,</v>
<v Speaker 2>economic and an ability to plan a </v>

4469
03:34:52.391 --> 03:34:57.391
<v Speaker 2>pregnancy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here we have women who want to have </v>

4470
03:34:57.391 --> 03:34:58.080
<v Speaker 2>careers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to go to college and they,</v>

4471
03:34:58.570 --> 03:35:03.570
<v Speaker 2>they delay pregnancy to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have realized a lot of those um,</v>

4472
03:35:05.470 --> 03:35:08.720
<v Speaker 2>aspirations and so pregnancies come </v>
<v Speaker 2>later and later and later and,</v>

4473
03:35:08.870 --> 03:35:13.870
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and families get smaller and smaller </v>

4474
03:35:13.870 --> 03:35:13.870
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

4475
03:35:13.870 --> 03:35:13.870
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4476
03:35:13.870 --> 03:35:17.200
<v Speaker 2>virtually no one chooses to have 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>

4477
03:35:17.850 --> 03:35:22.850
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the face of all of this other </v>

4478
03:35:22.850 --> 03:35:26.160
<v Speaker 2>opportunity that were the things they </v>
<v Speaker 2>also want that life,</v>

4479
03:35:26.230 --> 03:35:27.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if,</v>

4480
03:35:27.081 --> 03:35:28.150
<v Speaker 2>if they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they can avoid it,</v>

4481
03:35:28.330 --> 03:35:30.250
<v Speaker 2>if you can't avoid it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then you just find yourself with 10</v>

4482
03:35:30.251 --> 03:35:30.880
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4483
03:35:31.540 --> 03:35:33.760
<v Speaker 2>Or if you have some religious dogma </v>
<v Speaker 2>which says,</v>

4484
03:35:33.761 --> 03:35:38.761
<v Speaker 2>you though it's possible to avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't avoid it because you were </v>

4485
03:35:38.761 --> 03:35:38.830
<v Speaker 2>put here to have as many kids as </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible,</v>

4486
03:35:39.130 --> 03:35:44.130
<v Speaker 3>but are you allowed to bring that up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you talk about the population </v>

4487
03:35:44.130 --> 03:35:44.410
<v Speaker 3>crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you allowed to.</v>

4488
03:35:44.470 --> 03:35:45.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>

4489
03:35:45.251 --> 03:35:48.340
<v Speaker 3>that's a fascinating piece of </v>
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>

4490
03:35:48.530 --> 03:35:48.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

4491
03:35:49.170 --> 03:35:51.300
<v Speaker 2>which population crisis are you thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>of?</v>

4492
03:35:51.310 --> 03:35:52.930
<v Speaker 2>Because there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a bunch of them.</v>

4493
03:35:53.020 --> 03:35:55.080
<v Speaker 2>They're two different ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're two opposite ones,</v>

4494
03:35:55.110 --> 03:35:58.310
<v Speaker 2>which is China where they don't let you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have girls will just,</v>

4495
03:35:58.590 --> 03:35:59.870
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want the,</v>

4496
03:36:00.000 --> 03:36:02.880
<v Speaker 2>they live lesson that I think they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>relaxed that a,</v>

4497
03:36:03.150 --> 03:36:05.070
<v Speaker 2>I think they've relaxed the one child </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy,</v>

4498
03:36:05.071 --> 03:36:07.830
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not sure I remember hearing </v>
<v Speaker 2>something about that.</v>

4499
03:36:07.831 --> 03:36:09.690
<v Speaker 2>And the other one you would say India.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4500
03:36:09.691 --> 03:36:09.990
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4501
03:36:09.991 --> 03:36:12.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm excited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>States know that there are the other,</v>

4502
03:36:13.230 --> 03:36:18.230
<v Speaker 2>there there's an overpopulation crisis </v>
<v Speaker 2>in certain countries and in and </v>

4503
03:36:18.871 --> 03:36:23.871
<v Speaker 2>disproportionately in the developing </v>
<v Speaker 2>world and there is under population in </v>

4504
03:36:23.871 --> 03:36:24.450
<v Speaker 2>the development world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're there.</v>

4505
03:36:24.690 --> 03:36:28.260
<v Speaker 2>Most of western Europe is not replacing </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

4506
03:36:28.380 --> 03:36:30.120
<v Speaker 2>So you're having,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4507
03:36:30.750 --> 03:36:33.570
<v Speaker 2>these senescent populations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4508
03:36:33.870 --> 03:36:37.060
<v Speaker 2>who have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just have to import the,</v>

4509
03:36:37.080 --> 03:36:42.080
<v Speaker 2>they rely on immigration for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for just that to carry on the functions </v>

4510
03:36:42.971 --> 03:36:47.971
<v Speaker 2>of society because they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not at anywhere near replacement</v>

4511
03:36:47.981 --> 03:36:52.981
<v Speaker 2>rate is the most surprising detail that </v>
<v Speaker 2>brings us home is that there are more </v>

4512
03:36:56.261 --> 03:37:01.261
<v Speaker 2>adult diapers as Japan and more adult </v>
<v Speaker 2>diapers sold in Japan than baby diapers.</v>

4513
03:37:02.860 --> 03:37:05.560
<v Speaker 2>Now just think about that for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>implication of that for society,</v>

4514
03:37:05.710 --> 03:37:10.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you have as a sign of how do you </v>

4515
03:37:10.710 --> 03:37:10.720
<v Speaker 2>have a functioning society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4516
03:37:10.721 --> 03:37:11.570
<v Speaker 2>barring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4517
03:37:11.571 --> 03:37:13.870
<v Speaker 2>perfect robots that can tend to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>needs,</v>

4518
03:37:14.310 --> 03:37:17.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you have just,</v>

4519
03:37:18.030 --> 03:37:18.350
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

4520
03:37:19.880 --> 03:37:24.880
<v Speaker 2>disproportionate number of people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are no longer economically productive </v>

4521
03:37:24.880 --> 03:37:28.580
<v Speaker 2>relying on the Labor of the young to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4522
03:37:28.780 --> 03:37:31.350
<v Speaker 2>keep them alive and cure their diseases </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

4523
03:37:31.370 --> 03:37:33.800
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4524
03:37:33.880 --> 03:37:36.700
<v Speaker 2>defend them from crime and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

4525
03:37:37.330 --> 03:37:39.700
<v Speaker 2>the ratio is totally out of whack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4526
03:37:40.420 --> 03:37:43.570
<v Speaker 2>So you need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need people like the world is a giant</v>

4527
03:37:43.571 --> 03:37:48.571
<v Speaker 2>Ponzi scheme on some level you keep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need new people to come in to </v>

4528
03:37:48.571 --> 03:37:50.140
<v Speaker 2>maintain it for the old people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Barring,</v>

4529
03:37:50.170 --> 03:37:55.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apart from having some technology that </v>

4530
03:37:55.170 --> 03:37:55.510
<v Speaker 2>allows you to do that without people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4531
03:37:56.500 --> 03:38:01.500
<v Speaker 2>but I think our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything I've heard about population </v>

4532
03:38:01.500 --> 03:38:02.820
<v Speaker 2>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it suggests that we are on course,</v>

4533
03:38:02.890 --> 03:38:07.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>globally to peak around nine and a half </v>

4534
03:38:07.890 --> 03:38:08.680
<v Speaker 2>billion and then taper off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

4535
03:38:08.681 --> 03:38:13.681
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anyone now is forecasting </v>
<v Speaker 2>this totally unsustainable growth where </v>

4536
03:38:14.021 --> 03:38:17.920
<v Speaker 2>we're going to wind up with the St Louis</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I nine and a half billion people you</v>

4537
03:38:17.930 --> 03:38:19.410
<v Speaker 2>said billing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4538
03:38:19.810 --> 03:38:22.540
<v Speaker 2>where we're going to hit something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>20 billion people,</v>

4539
03:38:22.780 --> 03:38:23.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4540
03:38:23.980 --> 03:38:27.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the most mouth,</v>

4541
03:38:27.910 --> 03:38:32.910
<v Speaker 2>Uzi and people are expressing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>concern at the moment,</v>

4542
03:38:33.370 --> 03:38:38.370
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was the case like 20 or 30 years </v>

4543
03:38:38.370 --> 03:38:40.651
<v Speaker 2>ago where they thought this is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to keep going and we're going to </v>

4544
03:38:40.651 --> 03:38:44.101
<v Speaker 2>hit the carrying capacity of the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is something like 40 billion </v>

4545
03:38:44.101 --> 03:38:44.101
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4546
03:38:44.680 --> 03:38:45.700
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4547
03:38:45.701 --> 03:38:47.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anyone thinks w w because </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just.</v>

4548
03:38:47.710 --> 03:38:52.710
<v Speaker 2>Fertility is falling everywhere but it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it has fallen actually below </v>

4549
03:38:53.050 --> 03:38:58.050
<v Speaker 2>replacement in the developed world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think in our lifetimes in or in </v>

4550
03:38:58.931 --> 03:39:03.931
<v Speaker 2>our children's lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's feasible that we figure out a way </v>

4551
03:39:04.900 --> 03:39:09.900
<v Speaker 2>in some way to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not endorsing like taking people's </v>

4552
03:39:09.900 --> 03:39:13.771
<v Speaker 2>money and giving it to other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in some sort of a way to eliminate </v>

4553
03:39:13.771 --> 03:39:14.230
<v Speaker 2>poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that even possible?</v>

4554
03:39:14.320 --> 03:39:19.320
<v Speaker 2>Is it ever going to be possible to </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely eliminate poverty worldwide </v>

4555
03:39:19.320 --> 03:39:20.260
<v Speaker 2>and within like a lifetime?</v>

4556
03:39:20.980 --> 03:39:25.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we talked about this the last </v>

4557
03:39:25.980 --> 03:39:28.531
<v Speaker 2>time when we spoke about ai,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean this is the implication of </v>

4558
03:39:28.531 --> 03:39:29.510
<v Speaker 2>much of what we talked about here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

4559
03:39:29.511 --> 03:39:34.511
<v Speaker 2>if you imagine building the perfect </v>
<v Speaker 2>labor saving technology,</v>

4560
03:39:35.030 --> 03:39:36.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you imagine?</v>

4561
03:39:36.470 --> 03:39:41.470
<v Speaker 2>Just having a machine that can build any</v>
<v Speaker 2>machine that can do any human labor,</v>

4562
03:39:43.450 --> 03:39:46.460
<v Speaker 2>you power by sunlight more or less for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the cost of raw materials.</v>

4563
03:39:46.461 --> 03:39:46.990
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>

4564
03:39:47.060 --> 03:39:51.740
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about the ultimate wealth</v>
<v Speaker 2>generation device and now we're not just</v>

4565
03:39:51.741 --> 03:39:56.741
<v Speaker 2>talking about blue collar labor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about the kind of labor </v>

4566
03:39:56.741 --> 03:39:56.741
<v Speaker 2>you and I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4567
03:39:56.741 --> 03:40:00.810
<v Speaker 2>So like the artistic labor and </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific labor and um,</v>

4568
03:40:01.120 --> 03:40:06.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a machine that comes up with good </v>

4569
03:40:06.120 --> 03:40:06.120
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4570
03:40:06.120 --> 03:40:06.710
<v Speaker 2>And here's what we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>general artificial intelligence,</v>

4571
03:40:07.280 --> 03:40:09.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

4572
03:40:09.410 --> 03:40:12.230
<v Speaker 2>if in the right political and economic </v>
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

4573
03:40:12.800 --> 03:40:17.540
<v Speaker 2>this would just cancel any need for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to have to work to survive,</v>

4574
03:40:18.020 --> 03:40:18.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4575
03:40:18.290 --> 03:40:23.290
<v Speaker 2>It just would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'd be enough of everything to go </v>

4576
03:40:23.290 --> 03:40:23.330
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the question would be,</v>

4577
03:40:23.840 --> 03:40:26.750
<v Speaker 2>do we have the right political and </v>
<v Speaker 2>economic system where we,</v>

4578
03:40:26.780 --> 03:40:30.380
<v Speaker 2>where we actually could spread that </v>
<v Speaker 2>wealth or would we just,</v>

4579
03:40:30.690 --> 03:40:34.700
<v Speaker 2>we just find ourselves in some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrendous arms race and,</v>

4580
03:40:34.730 --> 03:40:35.710
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4581
03:40:35.950 --> 03:40:36.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>situation of,</v>

4582
03:40:36.950 --> 03:40:41.510
<v Speaker 2>of wealth inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unlike any we've ever seen.</v>

4583
03:40:41.570 --> 03:40:43.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

4584
03:40:43.761 --> 03:40:44.590
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't,</v>

4585
03:40:44.591 --> 03:40:46.940
<v Speaker 2>we don't have the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not in place now.</v>

4586
03:40:46.941 --> 03:40:49.190
<v Speaker 2>And if someone just handed us this </v>
<v Speaker 2>device,</v>

4587
03:40:49.670 --> 03:40:50.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

4588
03:40:50.060 --> 03:40:51.730
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4589
03:40:52.840 --> 03:40:53.720
<v Speaker 2>and it were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4590
03:40:53.850 --> 03:40:56.360
<v Speaker 2>all of my concerns about ai or gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4591
03:40:56.361 --> 03:41:01.361
<v Speaker 2>there's no question about this thing I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing things we didn't want it would do </v>

4592
03:41:01.361 --> 03:41:03.260
<v Speaker 2>exactly what we want when we want it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's no,</v>

4593
03:41:03.261 --> 03:41:07.310
<v Speaker 2>there's just no danger of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interest becoming misaligned with</v>

4594
03:41:07.311 --> 03:41:12.311
<v Speaker 2>our own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like a perfect oracle and a </v>

4595
03:41:12.311 --> 03:41:12.311
<v Speaker 2>perfect designer of new technology.</v>

4596
03:41:12.311 --> 03:41:15.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it was handed to us now,</v>

4597
03:41:16.640 --> 03:41:20.720
<v Speaker 2>I would expect just complete chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4598
03:41:20.721 --> 03:41:21.410
<v Speaker 2>I would explain if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

4599
03:41:21.470 --> 03:41:26.470
<v Speaker 2>if facebook built this thing tomorrow </v>
<v Speaker 2>and announced it or rumor spread that </v>

4600
03:41:26.841 --> 03:41:27.770
<v Speaker 2>they had built it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4601
03:41:28.490 --> 03:41:30.770
<v Speaker 2>What are the implications for Russia and</v>
<v Speaker 2>China?</v>

4602
03:41:30.920 --> 03:41:35.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in so far as they are as adversarial as </v>

4603
03:41:35.920 --> 03:41:40.301
<v Speaker 2>they are now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be rational for them to just </v>

4604
03:41:40.301 --> 03:41:40.301
<v Speaker 2>nuke California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4605
03:41:40.301 --> 03:41:43.050
<v Speaker 2>Because it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the happiness device is,</v>

4606
03:41:43.051 --> 03:41:45.170
<v Speaker 2>there's a winner take all scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4607
03:41:45.171 --> 03:41:45.590
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

4608
03:41:45.591 --> 03:41:47.780
<v Speaker 2>when the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have this device,</v>

4609
03:41:47.781 --> 03:41:49.540
<v Speaker 2>you can turn the lights off in China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4610
03:41:49.640 --> 03:41:54.640
<v Speaker 2>the moment you have this device,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can just imagine it's just the </v>

4611
03:41:54.640 --> 03:41:57.011
<v Speaker 2>ultimate because literally we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about and you know,</v>

4612
03:41:57.441 --> 03:41:59.960
<v Speaker 2>many people are may doubt whether such a</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing as possible.</v>

4613
03:41:59.961 --> 03:42:04.961
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just talking about the </v>

4614
03:42:04.961 --> 03:42:08.501
<v Speaker 2>implications of intelligence that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>make refinements to itself in over time </v>

4615
03:42:11.241 --> 03:42:11.750
<v Speaker 2>course.</v>

4616
03:42:11.810 --> 03:42:16.810
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it bears no relationship to what we </v>

4617
03:42:16.810 --> 03:42:17.270
<v Speaker 2>experienced as apes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4618
03:42:17.271 --> 03:42:21.170
<v Speaker 2>So you're talking about a system that </v>
<v Speaker 2>can make changes to his own source code,</v>

4619
03:42:21.730 --> 03:42:24.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and become better and better at learning</v>

4620
03:42:24.861 --> 03:42:27.380
<v Speaker 2>and more and more knowledgeable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has Instantaneous,</v>

4621
03:42:27.381 --> 03:42:32.381
<v Speaker 2>if we give it access to the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has instantaneous to all human and </v>

4622
03:42:32.381 --> 03:42:36.150
<v Speaker 2>machine knowledge and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does,</v>

4623
03:42:36.300 --> 03:42:39.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years of work every,</v>

4624
03:42:39.750 --> 03:42:42.740
<v Speaker 2>every day of our lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4625
03:42:42.750 --> 03:42:46.230
<v Speaker 2>They thousands of years of equivalent </v>
<v Speaker 2>human level intellectual work.</v>

4626
03:42:48.060 --> 03:42:51.610
<v Speaker 2>It's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's on our intuitions completely falter</v>

4627
03:42:51.640 --> 03:42:51.960
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

4628
03:42:51.980 --> 03:42:55.260
<v Speaker 2>to capture just how immensely powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>such a thing would be.</v>

4629
03:42:55.261 --> 03:42:58.350
<v Speaker 2>And there's no reason to think this </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't possible.</v>

4630
03:42:58.650 --> 03:42:58.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4631
03:42:59.060 --> 03:43:04.060
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most skeptical thing you can </v>

4632
03:43:04.060 --> 03:43:04.470
<v Speaker 2>honestly say about this is that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't coming soon,</v>

4633
03:43:04.860 --> 03:43:05.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

4634
03:43:05.521 --> 03:43:08.130
<v Speaker 2>this is not to say that this is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

4635
03:43:08.820 --> 03:43:10.500
<v Speaker 2>Makes no scientific sense at this point.</v>

4636
03:43:10.860 --> 03:43:15.860
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason to think that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sufficiently advanced digital computer </v>

4637
03:43:16.590 --> 03:43:21.590
<v Speaker 2>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't instantiate general intelligence </v>

4638
03:43:21.590 --> 03:43:23.100
<v Speaker 2>of the sort that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason to think that.</v>

4639
03:43:23.190 --> 03:43:28.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the intelligence has to be at bottom </v>

4640
03:43:28.190 --> 03:43:30.860
<v Speaker 2>some form of information processing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>if we get the algorithm right with </v>

4641
03:43:30.860 --> 03:43:35.121
<v Speaker 2>enough hardware resources and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the limit is definitely not the </v>

4642
03:43:35.341 --> 03:43:36.360
<v Speaker 2>hardware at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

4643
03:43:36.361 --> 03:43:38.340
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the algorithms.</v>

4644
03:43:38.820 --> 03:43:43.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just no reason to think this </v>

4645
03:43:43.820 --> 03:43:47.180
<v Speaker 2>can't take off and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and scale and that we would be in the </v>

4646
03:43:47.180 --> 03:43:48.120
<v Speaker 2>presence of something that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>

4647
03:43:48.121 --> 03:43:50.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like having an,</v>

4648
03:43:50.930 --> 03:43:55.930
<v Speaker 2>an alternate human civilization in a box</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is making thousands of years of </v>

4649
03:43:56.431 --> 03:43:58.080
<v Speaker 2>progress every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4650
03:43:58.081 --> 03:44:00.120
<v Speaker 2>So just imagine that if you had in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>box,</v>

4651
03:44:00.710 --> 03:44:03.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 10 smartest people who've ever lived</v>

4652
03:44:03.630 --> 03:44:05.880
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time,</v>

4653
03:44:05.881 --> 03:44:08.310
<v Speaker 2>every week they make 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years of progress,</v>

4654
03:44:08.430 --> 03:44:08.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4655
03:44:08.670 --> 03:44:10.980
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that is the actual,</v>

4656
03:44:11.110 --> 03:44:16.110
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were talking about electronic </v>

4657
03:44:16.110 --> 03:44:16.110
<v Speaker 2>circuits being a million times faster </v>
<v Speaker 2>than,</v>

4658
03:44:16.110 --> 03:44:18.480
<v Speaker 2>than biological circuits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even if it was just,</v>

4659
03:44:18.630 --> 03:44:21.270
<v Speaker 2>and I believe I said this the last time </v>
<v Speaker 2>we talked about ai,</v>

4660
03:44:21.271 --> 03:44:21.880
<v Speaker 2>but this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4661
03:44:21.950 --> 03:44:26.130
<v Speaker 2>this is what brings it home for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it's just a matter of faster,</v>

4662
03:44:26.250 --> 03:44:26.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

4663
03:44:26.971 --> 03:44:31.230
<v Speaker 2>it's not anything especially spooky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just this can do human level,</v>

4664
03:44:31.231 --> 03:44:34.410
<v Speaker 2>intellectual work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just a million times faster.</v>

4665
03:44:34.950 --> 03:44:39.950
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this totally under sells the prospects </v>

4666
03:44:39.950 --> 03:44:44.300
<v Speaker 2>of superintelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think human level intellectual work </v>

4667
03:44:44.300 --> 03:44:44.300
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

4668
03:44:44.300 --> 03:44:45.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4669
03:44:45.420 --> 03:44:47.700
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna seem pretty paltry in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>end,</v>

4670
03:44:47.701 --> 03:44:49.710
<v Speaker 2>but if you just imagined just speeding </v>
<v Speaker 2>it up.</v>

4671
03:44:49.770 --> 03:44:51.900
<v Speaker 2>If you imagine if we were doing this </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>

4672
03:44:52.410 --> 03:44:57.150
<v Speaker 2>imagine how smart I would seem if </v>
<v Speaker 2>between every sentence.</v>

4673
03:44:57.690 --> 03:45:02.250
<v Speaker 2>I actually had a year to figure out what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say next.</v>

4674
03:45:02.250 --> 03:45:07.250
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I say this one sentence and you </v>

4675
03:45:07.250 --> 03:45:08.811
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you asked me a question and then in my </v>

4676
03:45:08.811 --> 03:45:10.791
<v Speaker 2>world I just have a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go spend the next year </v>

4677
03:45:10.791 --> 03:45:10.791
<v Speaker 2>getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting ready for,</v>

4678
03:45:10.791 --> 03:45:12.630
<v Speaker 2>for Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's going to be perfect.</v>

4679
03:45:13.110 --> 03:45:16.060
<v Speaker 2>And this is just compounding upon </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

4680
03:45:16.061 --> 03:45:18.210
<v Speaker 2>Like not only can I not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only,</v>

4681
03:45:18.390 --> 03:45:19.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4682
03:45:19.471 --> 03:45:21.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I working faster?</v>

4683
03:45:21.810 --> 03:45:25.710
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately I can change my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my ability to work faster.</v>

4684
03:45:25.711 --> 03:45:30.711
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about software that can </v>

4685
03:45:30.711 --> 03:45:30.711
<v Speaker 2>change itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about something that,</v>

4686
03:45:30.711 --> 03:45:33.800
<v Speaker 2>that becomes self improving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a compounding and function </v>

4687
03:45:33.800 --> 03:45:33.800
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

4688
03:45:33.800 --> 03:45:37.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the point is,</v>

4689
03:45:37.231 --> 03:45:38.930
<v Speaker 2>is unimaginable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4690
03:45:38.980 --> 03:45:41.360
<v Speaker 2>in terms of how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4691
03:45:42.700 --> 03:45:47.700
<v Speaker 2>how much change this could affect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you imagine the best case </v>

4692
03:45:47.700 --> 03:45:49.450
<v Speaker 2>scenario where this is under our </v>
<v Speaker 2>control,</v>

4693
03:45:49.480 --> 03:45:51.100
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where there's no alignment problem,</v>

4694
03:45:51.101 --> 03:45:51.820
<v Speaker 2>where it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't,</v>

4695
03:45:51.821 --> 03:45:53.650
<v Speaker 2>this thing doesn't do anything that </v>
<v Speaker 2>surprises us,</v>

4696
03:45:54.010 --> 03:45:56.380
<v Speaker 2>this thing will always take direction </v>
<v Speaker 2>from us.</v>

4697
03:45:56.860 --> 03:46:01.860
<v Speaker 2>It will never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will never develop interests of its </v>

4698
03:46:01.860 --> 03:46:01.860
<v Speaker 2>own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4699
03:46:01.860 --> 03:46:02.080
<v Speaker 2>Which is again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fear.</v>

4700
03:46:02.081 --> 03:46:04.210
<v Speaker 2>But let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just say this is totally obedient.</v>

4701
03:46:04.211 --> 03:46:07.660
<v Speaker 2>It's just an oracle and a genie route </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

4702
03:46:07.830 --> 03:46:10.060
<v Speaker 2>in one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

4703
03:46:10.540 --> 03:46:11.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we say,</v>

4704
03:46:11.201 --> 03:46:16.201
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cure Alzheimer's and it cures </v>

4705
03:46:16.201 --> 03:46:16.201
<v Speaker 2>Alzheimer's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4706
03:46:16.201 --> 03:46:16.300
<v Speaker 2>you solve the protein folding problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

4707
03:46:16.301 --> 03:46:19.210
<v Speaker 2>and it just is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just often running and to develop a</v>

4708
03:46:19.211 --> 03:46:23.020
<v Speaker 2>perfect nanotechnology and it does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all,</v>

4709
03:46:23.021 --> 03:46:24.670
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going back to David Deutsch,</v>

4710
03:46:25.240 --> 03:46:30.240
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason to think this isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible because anything that's </v>

4711
03:46:30.240 --> 03:46:34.471
<v Speaker 2>compatible with the laws of physics can </v>
<v Speaker 2>be done given the requisite knowledge,</v>

4712
03:46:34.870 --> 03:46:39.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just get enough intelligence as </v>

4713
03:46:39.870 --> 03:46:40.630
<v Speaker 2>long as you're not violating the laws of</v>
<v Speaker 2>physics,</v>

4714
03:46:40.660 --> 03:46:43.750
<v Speaker 2>you can do something in that space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4715
03:46:44.710 --> 03:46:46.570
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is this is a winner take</v>

4716
03:46:46.571 --> 03:46:48.760
<v Speaker 2>all scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So facebook does it tomorrow,</v>

4717
03:46:49.270 --> 03:46:51.970
<v Speaker 2>and China and Russia find out about it.</v>

4718
03:46:52.600 --> 03:46:57.600
<v Speaker 2>They can't afford to wait around to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether the US decides to do something </v>

4719
03:46:57.600 --> 03:46:59.980
<v Speaker 2>not entirely selfish with this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4720
03:46:59.981 --> 03:47:04.981
<v Speaker 2>Because they're their worst fears could </v>
<v Speaker 2>be realized if Donald Trump is </v>

4721
03:47:04.981 --> 03:47:09.961
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was Donald Trump going to do with a </v>

4722
03:47:09.961 --> 03:47:11.080
<v Speaker 2>perfect ai when he has already told the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world that he hates Islam?</v>

4723
03:47:11.081 --> 03:47:12.140
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4724
03:47:12.790 --> 03:47:15.130
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

4725
03:47:15.131 --> 03:47:20.131
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would have to have a political and </v>

4726
03:47:20.131 --> 03:47:23.140
<v Speaker 2>economic system that allowed us to </v>
<v Speaker 2>absorb this ultimate wealth,</v>

4727
03:47:23.141 --> 03:47:25.210
<v Speaker 2>save it will wealth producing </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>

4728
03:47:25.270 --> 03:47:26.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

4729
03:47:27.060 --> 03:47:32.060
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this may sound like pure Saifai </v>

4730
03:47:32.060 --> 03:47:34.830
<v Speaker 2>craziness to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there is any reason to </v>

4731
03:47:34.830 --> 03:47:38.581
<v Speaker 2>believe that it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but walk way back from that edge of </v>

4732
03:47:38.581 --> 03:47:40.840
<v Speaker 2>craziness and just look at dumb ai,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4733
03:47:40.841 --> 03:47:44.260
<v Speaker 2>narrow ai,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just self driving cars and automation.</v>

4734
03:47:44.261 --> 03:47:49.261
<v Speaker 2>And I'm an intelligent algorithms that </v>
<v Speaker 2>can do human level work,</v>

4735
03:47:51.440 --> 03:47:56.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is already poised to change our </v>

4736
03:47:56.440 --> 03:47:58.990
<v Speaker 2>world massively and create massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>wealth inequality,</v>

4737
03:47:58.991 --> 03:47:59.420
<v Speaker 2>which we have.</v>

4738
03:47:59.460 --> 03:48:01.540
<v Speaker 2>We have to figure out how to spread this</v>
<v Speaker 2>wealth.</v>

4739
03:48:02.080 --> 03:48:06.430
<v Speaker 2>What do you do when you can automate a </v>
<v Speaker 2>50 percent of,</v>

4740
03:48:06.670 --> 03:48:11.670
<v Speaker 2>of human labor?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you paying attention to the </v>

4741
03:48:11.670 --> 03:48:13.420
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence go match?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4742
03:48:14.880 --> 03:48:19.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't actually play go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I wasn't paying that kind of </v>

4743
03:48:19.880 --> 03:48:19.930
<v Speaker 2>attention to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm aware of what happened there.</v>

4744
03:48:19.931 --> 03:48:21.040
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rules of go.</v>

4745
03:48:21.970 --> 03:48:24.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not so that I know.</v>

4746
03:48:24.041 --> 03:48:25.120
<v Speaker 2>Actually I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

4747
03:48:25.121 --> 03:48:25.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4748
03:48:25.850 --> 03:48:28.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I know vaguely how you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you,</v>

4749
03:48:28.641 --> 03:48:30.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it looks when a game is played,</v>

4750
03:48:30.741 --> 03:48:32.690
<v Speaker 2>but I don't supposed to be very </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated.</v>

4751
03:48:32.691 --> 03:48:37.691
<v Speaker 2>The more complicated and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities than chess and that's why </v>

4752
03:48:37.691 --> 03:48:42.671
<v Speaker 2>it took 20 years longer for a computer </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be the best player in the world.</v>

4753
03:48:43.690 --> 03:48:44.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4754
03:48:44.690 --> 03:48:45.920
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4755
03:48:47.030 --> 03:48:48.620
<v Speaker 2>did you see how the computer did it too?</v>

4756
03:48:49.810 --> 03:48:50.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

4757
03:48:50.301 --> 03:48:51.620
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

4758
03:48:51.700 --> 03:48:56.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is the company that did it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is deep mind which was acquired by </v>

4759
03:48:56.781 --> 03:49:01.781
<v Speaker 2>Google and they're at the cutting edge </v>
<v Speaker 2>of ai research and yeah.</v>

4760
03:49:01.821 --> 03:49:02.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4761
03:49:03.500 --> 03:49:07.760
<v Speaker 2>the cartoons are unfortunately not so </v>
<v Speaker 2>far from what is possible,</v>

4762
03:49:07.761 --> 03:49:11.060
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4763
03:49:11.061 --> 03:49:11.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4764
03:49:11.961 --> 03:49:14.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

4765
03:49:14.211 --> 03:49:16.970
<v Speaker 2>this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not general intelligence.</v>

4766
03:49:17.290 --> 03:49:22.290
<v Speaker 2>We're talking like these are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>machines that can even play tic Tac toe </v>

4767
03:49:22.290 --> 03:49:22.290
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some,</v>

4768
03:49:22.290 --> 03:49:26.600
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there have been some moves away from </v>

4769
03:49:26.600 --> 03:49:29.141
<v Speaker 2>this or like deep mind has trained an </v>
<v Speaker 2>algorithm to play all of the Atari Games</v>

4770
03:49:30.471 --> 03:49:30.860
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4771
03:49:30.920 --> 03:49:35.920
<v Speaker 2>from 1980 or whenever and it is very </v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly became superhuman on most of </v>

4772
03:49:37.131 --> 03:49:38.820
<v Speaker 2>them I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's superhuman human,</v>

4773
03:49:38.870 --> 03:49:43.870
<v Speaker 2>all of them yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it could play in a space invaders </v>

4774
03:49:43.870 --> 03:49:44.330
<v Speaker 2>and all these and break out all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>games that are,</v>

4775
03:49:44.420 --> 03:49:45.020
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4776
03:49:45.880 --> 03:49:47.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4777
03:49:48.800 --> 03:49:53.800
<v Speaker 2>to highly unlike one another and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same algorithm becoming expert and </v>

4778
03:49:54.621 --> 03:49:55.850
<v Speaker 2>superhuman in all of them.</v>

4779
03:49:55.850 --> 03:50:00.850
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a new paradigm and it's using a </v>

4780
03:50:00.850 --> 03:50:01.700
<v Speaker 2>technique called deep learning for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4781
03:50:02.510 --> 03:50:05.240
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's been very exciting and I will</v>

4782
03:50:05.241 --> 03:50:07.130
<v Speaker 2>be incredibly useful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4783
03:50:07.160 --> 03:50:09.020
<v Speaker 2>this is in the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the flip side of all this.</v>

4784
03:50:09.021 --> 03:50:11.840
<v Speaker 2>I know that everything I tend to say on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this sound scary,</v>

4785
03:50:11.841 --> 03:50:14.010
<v Speaker 2>but this is all like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4786
03:50:14.200 --> 03:50:17.900
<v Speaker 2>the next scariest thing is not to do any</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this stuff.</v>

4787
03:50:17.901 --> 03:50:19.640
<v Speaker 2>It's like we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want intelligence,</v>

4788
03:50:19.641 --> 03:50:24.641
<v Speaker 2>we want automation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to figure out how to solve </v>

4789
03:50:24.641 --> 03:50:28.211
<v Speaker 2>problems that we can't get solved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like intelligence is the best thing </v>

4790
03:50:28.211 --> 03:50:28.211
<v Speaker 2>we've got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we want more of it.</v>

4791
03:50:28.211 --> 03:50:29.960
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have to have a system where,</v>

4792
03:50:30.350 --> 03:50:35.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's scary that we have a system where </v>

4793
03:50:35.350 --> 03:50:37.391
<v Speaker 2>if you gave the best possible version of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it to one research lab or to one </v>

4794
03:50:38.241 --> 03:50:43.241
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not obvious that that wouldn't </v>

4795
03:50:43.241 --> 03:50:44.690
<v Speaker 2>destroy humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

4796
03:50:44.720 --> 03:50:48.200
<v Speaker 2>That wouldn't lead to massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>dislocations where you'd have,</v>

4797
03:50:48.201 --> 03:50:53.201
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some trillionaire who's trumpeting his </v>

4798
03:50:53.201 --> 03:50:53.201
<v Speaker 2>new device and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just,</v>

4799
03:50:53.201 --> 03:50:54.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 percent unemployment in the US,</v>

4800
03:50:54.680 --> 03:50:56.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a month.</v>

4801
03:50:56.361 --> 03:50:56.950
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like he,</v>

4802
03:50:56.980 --> 03:51:01.980
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not obvious how we would absorb </v>

4803
03:51:01.980 --> 03:51:01.980
<v Speaker 2>this level of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of progress.</v>

4804
03:51:02.390 --> 03:51:03.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we,</v>

4805
03:51:03.311 --> 03:51:04.610
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we definitely have to,</v>

4806
03:51:05.030 --> 03:51:10.030
<v Speaker 2>to figure out how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now of course we can't assume the </v>

4807
03:51:10.030 --> 03:51:10.030
<v Speaker 2>best case scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4808
03:51:10.030 --> 03:51:13.130
<v Speaker 2>That's the best case scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a few people that put it</v>

4809
03:51:13.131 --> 03:51:18.131
<v Speaker 2>the way you put it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that terrify the shit out of people and </v>

4810
03:51:18.131 --> 03:51:22.750
<v Speaker 2>everyone else seems to have this rosy </v>
<v Speaker 2>vision of increased longevity and </v>

4811
03:51:22.750 --> 03:51:25.040
<v Speaker 2>automated everything and everything</v>

4812
03:51:26.040 --> 03:51:30.210
<v Speaker 3>and easy to get to work and medical </v>
<v Speaker 3>procedures would be easier.</v>

4813
03:51:30.211 --> 03:51:35.211
<v Speaker 3>They're going to know how to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but everybody looks at it like we are </v>

4814
03:51:35.211 --> 03:51:35.820
<v Speaker 3>always going to be here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but are we obsolete?</v>

4815
03:51:35.970 --> 03:51:40.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this idea of a living thing that's </v>

4816
03:51:40.970 --> 03:51:44.451
<v Speaker 3>creative and wrapped up in emotions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>lust and desires and jealousy and all </v>

4817
03:51:44.451 --> 03:51:47.130
<v Speaker 3>the pettiness that we celebrated all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

4818
03:51:47.131 --> 03:51:49.470
<v Speaker 3>We still see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not getting any better.</v>

4819
03:51:49.560 --> 03:51:50.420
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

4820
03:51:50.520 --> 03:51:52.830
<v Speaker 3>if we obsolete,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4821
03:51:52.890 --> 03:51:54.930
<v Speaker 3>what if this thing comes along and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

4822
03:51:54.990 --> 03:51:59.990
<v Speaker 3>there's a way to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to abandon all that stupid </v>

4823
03:51:59.990 --> 03:52:02.241
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can abandon all that makes you all </v>

4824
03:52:02.241 --> 03:52:02.241
<v Speaker 3>the stuff that makes you fun to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>

4825
03:52:02.241 --> 03:52:02.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also fucks with.</v>

4826
03:52:02.971 --> 03:52:05.460
<v Speaker 3>You can live three times as long without</v>
<v Speaker 3>that stuff.</v>

4827
03:52:05.990 --> 03:52:07.380
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it.</v>

4828
03:52:08.770 --> 03:52:12.800
<v Speaker 2>It would in the best case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would usher in a,</v>

4829
03:52:13.210 --> 03:52:17.450
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The possibility of,</v>

4830
03:52:17.460 --> 03:52:22.460
<v Speaker 2>of kind of fundamentally creative life </v>
<v Speaker 2>where on the order of something like the</v>

4831
03:52:23.481 --> 03:52:28.481
<v Speaker 2>Matrix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's in the matrix or it's just </v>

4832
03:52:28.481 --> 03:52:30.671
<v Speaker 2>in the world that has been made as </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful as,</v>

4833
03:52:31.790 --> 03:52:34.050
<v Speaker 2>as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4834
03:52:34.490 --> 03:52:35.390
<v Speaker 2>based on</v>

4835
03:52:37.020 --> 03:52:40.500
<v Speaker 2>what would functionally be an unlimited </v>
<v Speaker 2>resource of intelligence.</v>

4836
03:52:40.650 --> 03:52:44.990
<v Speaker 2>Let me just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like for there to be a,</v>

4837
03:52:45.030 --> 03:52:50.030
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an ability to solve problems of a sort </v>

4838
03:52:50.030 --> 03:52:52.050
<v Speaker 2>that we can't currently imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4839
03:52:52.051 --> 03:52:57.051
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really is like a place on the map </v>

4840
03:52:57.051 --> 03:52:57.051
<v Speaker 2>that you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

4841
03:52:57.051 --> 03:52:57.690
<v Speaker 2>you can indicate it's over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4842
03:52:57.691 --> 03:53:01.050
<v Speaker 2>it's like the blank spot on the map.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ms Dot why it's called the singularity,</v>

4843
03:53:01.051 --> 03:53:01.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

4844
03:53:01.550 --> 03:53:02.880
<v Speaker 2>this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a,</v>

4845
03:53:03.530 --> 03:53:03.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

4846
03:53:03.961 --> 03:53:05.190
<v Speaker 2>it was John von Neumann,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

4847
03:53:05.191 --> 03:53:10.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm the inventor of Game Theory who a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mathematician who,</v>

4848
03:53:10.750 --> 03:53:15.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>want along with Alan Turing and a couple</v>

4849
03:53:15.121 --> 03:53:18.180
<v Speaker 2>of other peoples who's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible for the computer revolution.</v>

4850
03:53:18.540 --> 03:53:22.980
<v Speaker 2>He was the first person to use this term</v>
<v Speaker 2>singularity to describe just this,</v>

4851
03:53:22.981 --> 03:53:26.400
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's a speeding up of,</v>

4852
03:53:26.910 --> 03:53:31.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>information processing technology and a </v>

4853
03:53:33.250 --> 03:53:35.450
<v Speaker 2>cultural reliance upon it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4854
03:53:35.520 --> 03:53:40.520
<v Speaker 2>beyond which we can't actually foresee </v>
<v Speaker 2>the level of change that can come over </v>

4855
03:53:40.520 --> 03:53:40.870
<v Speaker 2>our society.</v>

4856
03:53:40.870 --> 03:53:41.350
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4857
03:53:41.351 --> 03:53:44.130
<v Speaker 2>an event horizon past which we can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>see.</v>

4858
03:53:44.580 --> 03:53:46.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

4859
03:53:47.210 --> 03:53:52.210
<v Speaker 2>this certainly becomes true when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about these intelligent systems </v>

4860
03:53:52.210 --> 03:53:53.880
<v Speaker 2>being able to make changes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

4861
03:53:54.210 --> 03:53:56.550
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking mostly software.</v>

4862
03:53:56.551 --> 03:53:57.870
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not imagining,</v>

4863
03:53:59.360 --> 03:54:04.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean the most important breakthroughs </v>
<v Speaker 2>are almost certainly at the level of </v>

4864
03:54:04.360 --> 03:54:04.440
<v Speaker 2>have better software.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4865
03:54:04.540 --> 03:54:09.090
<v Speaker 2>is we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of the computing power that the</v>

4866
03:54:09.330 --> 03:54:11.940
<v Speaker 2>physical hardware on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

4867
03:54:11.941 --> 03:54:14.460
<v Speaker 2>that's not what's limiting our ai at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>

4868
03:54:14.461 --> 03:54:17.270
<v Speaker 2>It's not like we need more more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4869
03:54:18.000 --> 03:54:19.520
<v Speaker 2>hardware,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4870
03:54:19.740 --> 03:54:24.740
<v Speaker 2>but we will get more hardware to up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the limits of physics and it gets </v>

4871
03:54:24.740 --> 03:54:26.230
<v Speaker 2>smaller and smaller as it has a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

4872
03:54:26.231 --> 03:54:30.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if quantum computing becomes possible or</v>

4873
03:54:30.611 --> 03:54:32.210
<v Speaker 2>practical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4874
03:54:32.290 --> 03:54:33.660
<v Speaker 2>that will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4875
03:54:34.000 --> 03:54:36.130
<v Speaker 2>and actually David Deutsch is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

4876
03:54:36.131 --> 03:54:41.131
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the physicist I mentioned is one of the </v>

4877
03:54:41.131 --> 03:54:43.171
<v Speaker 2>fathers of the concept of quantum </v>
<v Speaker 2>computing that will open up a whole </v>

4878
03:54:44.531 --> 03:54:49.150
<v Speaker 2>nother area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a extreme of computing power.</v>

4879
03:54:49.600 --> 03:54:54.600
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not at all analogous to the kinds </v>

4880
03:54:54.600 --> 03:54:54.600
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of uh,</v>

4881
03:54:54.600 --> 03:54:55.870
<v Speaker 2>machines we have now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

4882
03:54:56.650 --> 03:54:59.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

4883
03:55:00.160 --> 03:55:05.160
<v Speaker 2>when you imagine people don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people seem to always want to have it.</v>

4884
03:55:06.360 --> 03:55:09.490
<v Speaker 2>I just had this conversation with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Neil degrasse Tyson on my podcast.</v>

4885
03:55:09.940 --> 03:55:14.230
<v Speaker 2>He named Robert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just keeping people.</v>

4886
03:55:14.231 --> 03:55:19.231
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just attributing these ideas to </v>

4887
03:55:19.231 --> 03:55:19.231
<v Speaker 2>handle a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not a,</v>

4888
03:55:19.231 --> 03:55:20.430
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't take this line at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not at all.</v>

4889
03:55:20.480 --> 03:55:21.730
<v Speaker 2>He thinks it's all bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4890
03:55:21.910 --> 03:55:25.810
<v Speaker 2>He's not at all worried about Ai.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does he think he thinks that,</v>

4891
03:55:25.960 --> 03:55:26.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just,</v>

4892
03:55:26.830 --> 03:55:31.390
<v Speaker 2>we just use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's drawing an analogy from how we,</v>

4893
03:55:31.750 --> 03:55:34.420
<v Speaker 2>you currently use computers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they just,</v>

4894
03:55:34.450 --> 03:55:37.300
<v Speaker 2>they just keep helping us do what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to do.</v>

4895
03:55:37.301 --> 03:55:42.301
<v Speaker 2>Like we decide what we want to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>computers and we just add them to our </v>

4896
03:55:42.301 --> 03:55:46.081
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that process becomes automated and </v>

4897
03:55:46.081 --> 03:55:48.040
<v Speaker 2>then we'll find new job somewhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you didn't need a stenographer once</v>

4898
03:55:48.041 --> 03:55:49.870
<v Speaker 2>you have voice recognition technology.</v>

4899
03:55:49.870 --> 03:55:52.780
<v Speaker 2>And I'm a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a problem,</v>

4900
03:55:52.781 --> 03:55:54.370
<v Speaker 2>a stenographer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll find something else to do.</v>

4901
03:55:54.371 --> 03:55:59.371
<v Speaker 2>And so the economic dislocation isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>that bad and computers will just get </v>

4902
03:56:00.221 --> 03:56:02.380
<v Speaker 2>better than they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

4903
03:56:02.381 --> 03:56:04.570
<v Speaker 2>eventually Siri will actually work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4904
03:56:04.571 --> 03:56:09.571
<v Speaker 2>and you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'll answer your questions well and </v>

4905
03:56:09.571 --> 03:56:12.121
<v Speaker 2>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to be a laugh line what </v>

4906
03:56:12.121 --> 03:56:12.121
<v Speaker 2>series said to you today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

4907
03:56:12.640 --> 03:56:17.640
<v Speaker 2>then all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll just proceed to make life better </v>

4908
03:56:17.640 --> 03:56:22.440
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of that is imagining what it will </v>

4909
03:56:22.440 --> 03:56:27.001
<v Speaker 2>be like to make because it will be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain point where you'll have systems </v>

4910
03:56:27.001 --> 03:56:28.450
<v Speaker 2>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4911
03:56:28.540 --> 03:56:33.540
<v Speaker 2>it's like the Cha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best chess player on earth is now </v>

4912
03:56:33.540 --> 03:56:35.010
<v Speaker 2>always going to be a computer right </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

4913
03:56:35.440 --> 03:56:40.440
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not going to be a human born </v>

4914
03:56:40.440 --> 03:56:40.440
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow that's going to be better than </v>
<v Speaker 2>the best computer.</v>

4915
03:56:40.440 --> 03:56:40.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

4916
03:56:40.750 --> 03:56:42.160
<v Speaker 2>it's already like it's.</v>

4917
03:56:42.760 --> 03:56:44.980
<v Speaker 2>We have super human chess players on </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>

4918
03:56:45.370 --> 03:56:50.370
<v Speaker 2>Now imagine having computers that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>superhuman at every,</v>

4919
03:56:51.010 --> 03:56:54.040
<v Speaker 2>every task that is relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every intellectual task,</v>

4920
03:56:54.041 --> 03:56:56.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the best physicist is a computer.</v>

4921
03:56:56.820 --> 03:57:01.820
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best medical diagnostician is a </v>

4922
03:57:01.820 --> 03:57:01.820
<v Speaker 2>computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best.</v>

4923
03:57:01.820 --> 03:57:04.270
<v Speaker 2>A prover of math.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Theorems has a computer,</v>

4924
03:57:04.271 --> 03:57:05.860
<v Speaker 2>the best engineers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a computer,</v>

4925
03:57:05.890 --> 03:57:06.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there's no,</v>

4926
03:57:06.760 --> 03:57:08.920
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason why we're not headed </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

4927
03:57:08.950 --> 03:57:13.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be the only reason I could see </v>

4928
03:57:13.950 --> 03:57:16.111
<v Speaker 2>we're not headed there is it something </v>
<v Speaker 2>massively dislocating happens that </v>

4929
03:57:16.111 --> 03:57:19.570
<v Speaker 2>prevents us from continuing to improve </v>
<v Speaker 2>our intelligent machines.</v>

4930
03:57:19.571 --> 03:57:24.571
<v Speaker 2>But if you just the moment admit that </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence is just a matter of </v>

4931
03:57:24.571 --> 03:57:28.601
<v Speaker 2>information processing and you admit </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we will continue to improve our </v>

4932
03:57:28.791 --> 03:57:33.791
<v Speaker 2>machines unless something heinous </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens because it's intelligence and </v>

4933
03:57:33.791 --> 03:57:35.240
<v Speaker 2>automation are the most valuable things </v>
<v Speaker 2>we have.</v>

4934
03:57:35.840 --> 03:57:37.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a certain point,</v>

4935
03:57:37.971 --> 03:57:40.610
<v Speaker 2>whether you think it's in five years or </v>
<v Speaker 2>500 years,</v>

4936
03:57:41.150 --> 03:57:45.590
<v Speaker 2>we're going to find ourselves in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>presence of superintelligent machines.</v>

4937
03:57:45.590 --> 03:57:50.590
<v Speaker 2>And then at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best source of innovation for the </v>

4938
03:57:51.771 --> 03:57:56.771
<v Speaker 2>next generation of software or hardware </v>
<v Speaker 2>or both will be the machines themselves.</v>

4939
03:57:57.650 --> 03:57:58.580
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then you.</v>

4940
03:57:58.880 --> 03:58:01.220
<v Speaker 2>So then you just have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that's where you get what,</v>

4941
03:58:01.490 --> 03:58:05.180
<v Speaker 2>what was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the mathematician Ij good described</v>

4942
03:58:05.181 --> 03:58:06.650
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the intelligence explosion,</v>

4943
03:58:06.651 --> 03:58:09.590
<v Speaker 2>which is just that the process can take </v>
<v Speaker 2>off on its own.</v>

4944
03:58:10.220 --> 03:58:11.450
<v Speaker 2>And this is where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4945
03:58:11.451 --> 03:58:13.910
<v Speaker 2>the singularity people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4946
03:58:14.840 --> 03:58:19.840
<v Speaker 2>either either are hopeful or worried,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because there's nothing,</v>

4947
03:58:20.060 --> 03:58:25.060
<v Speaker 2>there's no guarantee that this process </v>
<v Speaker 2>will be remain aligned with our </v>

4948
03:58:25.491 --> 03:58:26.210
<v Speaker 2>interests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

4949
03:58:26.320 --> 03:58:28.790
<v Speaker 2>and every person who I meet even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4950
03:58:28.791 --> 03:58:31.090
<v Speaker 2>very smart people like Neil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4951
03:58:31.850 --> 03:58:36.850
<v Speaker 2>who says they're not worried about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you actually drill down on why </v>

4952
03:58:36.850 --> 03:58:41.441
<v Speaker 2>they're not worried,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find that they're actually not </v>

4953
03:58:41.441 --> 03:58:44.531
<v Speaker 2>imagining machines making changes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own source code.</v>

4954
03:58:45.630 --> 03:58:50.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're not [inaudible] they're,</v>

4955
03:58:50.230 --> 03:58:55.230
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they simply believe that this is so far </v>

4956
03:58:55.230 --> 03:58:56.990
<v Speaker 2>away that we don't have to worry about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it now.</v>

4957
03:58:57.410 --> 03:59:02.410
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually a nonsequitor I </v>

4958
03:59:02.410 --> 03:59:02.410
<v Speaker 2>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say that this is far away,</v>

4959
03:59:02.410 --> 03:59:06.940
<v Speaker 2>is not actually grappling with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not an argument that this isn't </v>

4960
03:59:06.940 --> 03:59:08.330
<v Speaker 2>going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

4961
03:59:08.590 --> 03:59:10.520
<v Speaker 2>and it's based on what to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

4962
03:59:10.521 --> 03:59:12.290
<v Speaker 2>and it's based on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

4963
03:59:12.320 --> 03:59:15.620
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason to believe.</v>

4964
03:59:16.370 --> 03:59:19.590
<v Speaker 2>Jamie want to find out where it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4965
03:59:21.320 --> 03:59:26.320
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we don't know how long it will </v>

4966
03:59:26.320 --> 03:59:26.320
<v Speaker 2>take us to prepare for this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4967
03:59:26.320 --> 03:59:26.390
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you were,</v>

4968
03:59:26.420 --> 03:59:31.420
<v Speaker 2>if you knew this was going to take 50 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years for this to happen,</v>

4969
03:59:32.840 --> 03:59:37.840
<v Speaker 2>is 50 years enough for us to prepare </v>
<v Speaker 2>politically and economically to deal </v>

4970
03:59:37.840 --> 03:59:42.221
<v Speaker 2>with the ramifications of this and to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and to say nothing of actually </v>

4971
03:59:42.221 --> 03:59:45.980
<v Speaker 2>building the ai safely in a way that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>aligned with our interests.</v>

4972
03:59:46.310 --> 03:59:47.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean 50,</v>

4973
03:59:47.541 --> 03:59:51.810
<v Speaker 2>so 50 years is we've had the iphone for </v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

4974
03:59:51.860 --> 03:59:52.520
<v Speaker 2>10 years?</v>

4975
03:59:53.360 --> 03:59:55.940
<v Speaker 2>Nine years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like 50 years.</v>

4976
03:59:55.941 --> 03:59:57.430
<v Speaker 2>Not a lot of time right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To,</v>

4977
03:59:57.480 --> 03:59:58.670
<v Speaker 2>to deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to deal with this.</v>

4978
03:59:58.730 --> 04:00:03.730
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has no reason to think it's,</v>

4979
04:00:04.040 --> 04:00:07.670
<v Speaker 2>it's that far away if we keep making </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress.</v>

4980
04:00:07.671 --> 04:00:08.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

4981
04:00:08.770 --> 04:00:10.700
<v Speaker 2>it will be amazing if it were 500 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

4982
04:00:11.060 --> 04:00:12.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems like it's,</v>

4983
04:00:12.490 --> 04:00:16.850
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more likely from what I mean,</v>

4984
04:00:16.940 --> 04:00:19.950
<v Speaker 2>the sense I get from the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing this work,</v>

4985
04:00:20.610 --> 04:00:25.470
<v Speaker 2>it's far more likely to be 50 years than</v>
<v Speaker 2>500 years.</v>

4986
04:00:25.800 --> 04:00:27.120
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4987
04:00:27.330 --> 04:00:32.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the peanut that people who think </v>

4988
04:00:32.461 --> 04:00:36.920
<v Speaker 2>this is a long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long way off or they're saying,</v>

4989
04:00:37.790 --> 04:00:40.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 to 100 years,</v>

4990
04:00:40.830 --> 04:00:43.340
<v Speaker 2>no one says 500 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4991
04:00:43.360 --> 04:00:44.490
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As far as I know,</v>

4992
04:00:44.540 --> 04:00:49.540
<v Speaker 2>no one who is actually close to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>work and some people think it could be </v>

4993
04:00:49.540 --> 04:00:50.250
<v Speaker 2>in five years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4994
04:00:50.250 --> 04:00:51.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean the people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4995
04:00:51.750 --> 04:00:55.710
<v Speaker 2>like the deep mind people who are very </v>
<v Speaker 2>close to this or are the sorts of people</v>

4996
04:00:55.711 --> 04:01:00.711
<v Speaker 2>who say because the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who are close to this work </v>

4997
04:01:00.711 --> 04:01:02.370
<v Speaker 2>are astonished by what's happened in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>last 10 years.</v>

4998
04:01:02.390 --> 04:01:07.390
<v Speaker 2>Like we went from a place of very little</v>
<v Speaker 2>progress to,</v>

4999
04:01:07.890 --> 04:01:09.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

5000
04:01:09.001 --> 04:01:13.290
<v Speaker 2>this is all of a sudden really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really interesting and powerful.</v>

5001
04:01:13.350 --> 04:01:17.190
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

5002
04:01:17.280 --> 04:01:19.740
<v Speaker 2>progress is compounding in a way that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>counter intuitive.</v>

5003
04:01:19.741 --> 04:01:24.741
<v Speaker 2>People systematically overestimate how </v>
<v Speaker 2>much change can happen in a year and </v>

5004
04:01:25.261 --> 04:01:27.480
<v Speaker 2>underestimate how much change can happen</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 10 years.</v>

5005
04:01:27.481 --> 04:01:28.230
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5006
04:01:28.560 --> 04:01:31.470
<v Speaker 2>as far as estimating how much change can</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen in 50 or 100 years,</v>

5007
04:01:31.980 --> 04:01:33.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that anyone is good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

5008
04:01:36.370 --> 04:01:41.370
<v Speaker 3>How could you be with giant leaps come </v>
<v Speaker 3>giant exponential leaps off those leaps </v>

5009
04:01:41.651 --> 04:01:46.651
<v Speaker 3>and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost impossible for us to really </v>

5010
04:01:46.651 --> 04:01:47.110
<v Speaker 3>predict what we're going to be looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>at 50 years from now,</v>

5011
04:01:47.530 --> 04:01:50.680
<v Speaker 3>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what they're going to think</v>

5012
04:01:50.681 --> 04:01:55.681
<v Speaker 3>about us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's most bizarre about it as </v>

5013
04:01:55.681 --> 04:01:58.741
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We really might be obsolete if we look </v>

5014
04:01:58.741 --> 04:02:00.070
<v Speaker 3>at how ridiculous we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this political campaign,</v>

5015
04:02:00.071 --> 04:02:01.930
<v Speaker 3>look at what we pay attention to in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>news,</v>

5016
04:02:01.960 --> 04:02:04.990
<v Speaker 3>look at the things we really focus on </v>
<v Speaker 3>where are strange,</v>

5017
04:02:04.991 --> 04:02:09.991
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if we look back on some strange </v>

5018
04:02:10.391 --> 04:02:13.360
<v Speaker 3>dinosaur that had a weird neck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why should that fucking thing make it?</v>

5019
04:02:13.770 --> 04:02:15.040
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why should we make it?</v>

5020
04:02:15.310 --> 04:02:20.310
<v Speaker 3>We might be here to make that thing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that thing takes over from here with no </v>

5021
04:02:20.771 --> 04:02:22.120
<v Speaker 3>emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no lust,</v>

5022
04:02:22.121 --> 04:02:27.121
<v Speaker 3>no greed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just purely existing electronically </v>

5023
04:02:27.121 --> 04:02:27.250
<v Speaker 3>and for what reason?</v>

5024
04:02:27.450 --> 04:02:28.710
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's a little scary.</v>

5025
04:02:28.711 --> 04:02:31.560
<v Speaker 2>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are computer scientists who,</v>

5026
04:02:31.561 --> 04:02:36.561
<v Speaker 2>when you talk about why they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>worried or talk to them about why </v>

5027
04:02:36.561 --> 04:02:40.161
<v Speaker 2>they're not worried,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just swallow this pill without any </v>

5028
04:02:40.951 --> 04:02:45.951
<v Speaker 2>qualm like we're gonna make the thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is far more powerful and beautiful </v>

5029
04:02:46.350 --> 04:02:51.350
<v Speaker 2>and important than we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it doesn't matter what happens to </v>

5030
04:02:51.350 --> 04:02:51.900
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was our role.</v>

5031
04:02:51.901 --> 04:02:56.700
<v Speaker 2>Our role was to build these mechanical </v>
<v Speaker 2>gods and,</v>

5032
04:02:57.420 --> 04:03:01.810
<v Speaker 2>and it's fine if they squash us and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

5033
04:03:01.811 --> 04:03:03.330
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've literally heard a,</v>

5034
04:03:03.430 --> 04:03:05.880
<v Speaker 2>a people say I've heard someone give a </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk.</v>

5035
04:03:06.450 --> 04:03:08.580
<v Speaker 2>That's what woke me up to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

5036
04:03:08.990 --> 04:03:11.790
<v Speaker 2>to how interesting this areas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to this conference in,</v>

5037
04:03:11.970 --> 04:03:16.970
<v Speaker 2>in San Juan about a year ago and there </v>
<v Speaker 2>were a,</v>

5038
04:03:17.500 --> 04:03:22.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the people from deep mind where </v>

5039
04:03:22.500 --> 04:03:22.720
<v Speaker 2>they are and the people who were very </v>
<v Speaker 2>close to this work were there.</v>

5040
04:03:23.170 --> 04:03:28.170
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going to hear some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons why you shouldn't be worried </v>

5041
04:03:29.260 --> 04:03:32.670
<v Speaker 2>from people who were interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>common.</v>

5042
04:03:32.680 --> 04:03:35.410
<v Speaker 2>The fear is so they could get on with </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing their very important work.</v>

5043
04:03:35.890 --> 04:03:40.890
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was amazing because they were highly </v>

5044
04:03:41.080 --> 04:03:46.080
<v Speaker 2>uncompelling reasons not to be worried </v>
<v Speaker 2>was just so,</v>

5045
04:03:47.950 --> 04:03:50.860
<v Speaker 2>so they had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had a desire to be compelled.</v>

5046
04:03:51.010 --> 04:03:52.730
<v Speaker 2>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not at all.</v>

5047
04:03:52.890 --> 04:03:55.660
<v Speaker 2>I will know that people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people want to do this.</v>

5048
04:03:56.560 --> 04:04:01.560
<v Speaker 2>There's a deep assumption in many of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people that we can figure it out </v>

5049
04:04:01.901 --> 04:04:03.240
<v Speaker 2>as we go along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5050
04:04:04.160 --> 04:04:09.160
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like we're gonna we're just </v>

5051
04:04:09.160 --> 04:04:09.160
<v Speaker 2>gonna get going to get closer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're foot.</v>

5052
04:04:09.160 --> 04:04:10.360
<v Speaker 2>We're far enough away now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even five year.</v>

5053
04:04:10.361 --> 04:04:11.680
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's five years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five years,</v>

5054
04:04:11.710 --> 04:04:12.040
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>

5055
04:04:12.070 --> 04:04:13.350
<v Speaker 2>we'll get there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once we get closer,</v>

5056
04:04:13.360 --> 04:04:18.360
<v Speaker 2>once we get something a little scary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we'll pull the brakes and talk </v>

5057
04:04:18.360 --> 04:04:18.550
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

5058
04:04:19.060 --> 04:04:24.060
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is they are assigned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone is essentially in a race </v>

5059
04:04:24.060 --> 04:04:24.780
<v Speaker 2>condition by default and you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5060
04:04:24.820 --> 04:04:29.820
<v Speaker 2>Google is racing against facebook and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the US is racing against China and </v>

5061
04:04:29.820 --> 04:04:34.140
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every group is racing against every </v>

5062
04:04:34.140 --> 04:04:34.140
<v Speaker 2>other group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5063
04:04:34.330 --> 04:04:36.910
<v Speaker 2>however you want to conceive of groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a,</v>

5064
04:04:37.300 --> 04:04:42.300
<v Speaker 2>to be the first one to be the first one </v>
<v Speaker 2>with an incredibly powerful,</v>

5065
04:04:44.891 --> 04:04:48.310
<v Speaker 2>narrow ai is to be the next,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5066
04:04:48.340 --> 04:04:51.370
<v Speaker 2>multibillion dollar company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5067
04:04:51.371 --> 04:04:54.520
<v Speaker 2>So everyone's trying to get there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5068
04:04:54.580 --> 04:04:59.580
<v Speaker 2>if they suddenly get there and sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>overshoot a little bit and now they've </v>

5069
04:04:59.580 --> 04:05:02.491
<v Speaker 2>got something like general intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 2>or something close to what we're relying</v>

5070
04:05:02.980 --> 04:05:07.980
<v Speaker 2>on every.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they know everyone else is </v>

5071
04:05:07.980 --> 04:05:07.980
<v Speaker 2>attempting to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5072
04:05:07.980 --> 04:05:11.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>W we don't have a system set up where </v>

5073
04:05:11.970 --> 04:05:13.360
<v Speaker 2>everyone can pull the breaks together </v>
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>

5074
04:05:13.361 --> 04:05:15.490
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got to stop racing here.</v>

5075
04:05:15.490 --> 04:05:20.490
<v Speaker 2>We have to share everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to share the wealth with the </v>

5076
04:05:20.490 --> 04:05:23.521
<v Speaker 2>share the information we have to um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this truly has to be open source in </v>

5077
04:05:23.521 --> 04:05:25.740
<v Speaker 2>every conceivable way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

5078
04:05:26.080 --> 04:05:29.860
<v Speaker 2>we have to diffuse this winner take all </v>
<v Speaker 2>dynamic.</v>

5079
04:05:30.280 --> 04:05:32.110
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5080
04:05:32.111 --> 04:05:37.111
<v Speaker 2>I think we need something like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Manhattan project to figure out how to </v>

5081
04:05:37.111 --> 04:05:37.111
<v Speaker 2>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5082
04:05:37.111 --> 04:05:38.440
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to figure out how to build the AI,</v>

5083
04:05:38.441 --> 04:05:43.441
<v Speaker 2>but to figure out how to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to build it in a way that does not </v>

5084
04:05:43.441 --> 04:05:46.591
<v Speaker 2>create an arms race that does not create</v>
<v Speaker 2>an incentive to build unsafe ai,</v>

5085
04:05:47.891 --> 04:05:52.891
<v Speaker 2>which is almost certainly going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>easier than building safe ai interested </v>

5086
04:05:52.891 --> 04:05:55.590
<v Speaker 2>to work out all of these issues because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not because what I think we are,</v>

5087
04:05:55.591 --> 04:06:00.591
<v Speaker 2>we're going to build this by default.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just going to keep building more </v>

5088
04:06:00.591 --> 04:06:04.891
<v Speaker 2>and more intelligent machines and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to be done in by everyone who </v>

5089
04:06:06.360 --> 04:06:09.700
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can do it with each generation.</v>

5090
04:06:09.700 --> 04:06:11.110
<v Speaker 2>If we were even talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>generations,</v>

5091
04:06:11.111 --> 04:06:14.740
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will have the tools made by the prior</v>

5092
04:06:15.890 --> 04:06:19.790
<v Speaker 2>that are more powerful than anyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagined 100 years ago and it just going</v>

5093
04:06:19.810 --> 04:06:24.810
<v Speaker 2>to keep going like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did anybody actually make that quote </v>

5094
04:06:24.810 --> 04:06:27.490
<v Speaker 2>about giving birth to the mechanical </v>
<v Speaker 2>gods or.</v>

5095
04:06:27.500 --> 04:06:29.370
<v Speaker 2>That was just made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>

5096
04:06:29.900 --> 04:06:32.720
<v Speaker 2>there was a scientist that actually was </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking and saying that,</v>

5097
04:06:32.750 --> 04:06:37.750
<v Speaker 2>but that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the content of what he was </v>

5098
04:06:37.750 --> 04:06:37.750
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

5099
04:06:37.750 --> 04:06:41.610
<v Speaker 2>we're going to build the next species </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is far more important than we are </v>

5100
04:06:42.590 --> 04:06:44.260
<v Speaker 2>and that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>

5101
04:06:44.410 --> 04:06:47.050
<v Speaker 2>and actually I can go there with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5102
04:06:47.090 --> 04:06:48.410
<v Speaker 2>it actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only,</v>

5103
04:06:48.411 --> 04:06:53.411
<v Speaker 2>the only caveat here is that unless </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not conscious,</v>

5104
04:06:54.080 --> 04:06:59.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like say if the true horror for me is </v>

5105
04:06:59.080 --> 04:06:59.930
<v Speaker 2>that we can build things more </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent than we are,</v>

5106
04:07:00.410 --> 04:07:05.410
<v Speaker 2>more powerful than we are a and that can</v>
<v Speaker 2>squash us and they might not.</v>

5107
04:07:07.050 --> 04:07:08.600
<v Speaker 2>They might be unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5108
04:07:08.610 --> 04:07:13.610
<v Speaker 2>That there might be nothing like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe could go dark if they squashes </v>

5109
04:07:13.610 --> 04:07:13.610
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

5110
04:07:13.610 --> 04:07:14.400
<v Speaker 2>or at least our corner of the universe </v>
<v Speaker 2>could go dark.</v>

5111
04:07:15.320 --> 04:07:17.120
<v Speaker 2>And yet these things will be immensely </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful.</v>

5112
04:07:17.460 --> 04:07:19.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if,</v>

5113
04:07:20.080 --> 04:07:20.920
<v Speaker 2>and this is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5114
04:07:20.930 --> 04:07:25.930
<v Speaker 2>the jury's out on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if there's nothing about </v>

5115
04:07:25.930 --> 04:07:27.650
<v Speaker 2>intelligence scaling that demands that </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness come along for the ride,</v>

5116
04:07:28.350 --> 04:07:30.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's possible that,</v>

5117
04:07:30.970 --> 04:07:32.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean nobody thinks our machines are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5118
04:07:32.810 --> 04:07:36.320
<v Speaker 2>very few people would think are machines</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are intelligent or conscious.</v>

5119
04:07:36.380 --> 04:07:38.870
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at what point does consciousness come</v>

5120
04:07:38.871 --> 04:07:43.730
<v Speaker 2>online or maybe it's possible to build </v>
<v Speaker 2>super intelligence that's unconscious,</v>

5121
04:07:44.340 --> 04:07:45.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super powerful,</v>

5122
04:07:45.800 --> 04:07:47.960
<v Speaker 2>does everything better than we do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5123
04:07:47.961 --> 04:07:50.330
<v Speaker 2>it'll recognize your emotion better </v>
<v Speaker 2>than,</v>

5124
04:07:50.420 --> 04:07:54.980
<v Speaker 2>than another person can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then the lights aren't on that.</v>

5125
04:07:55.190 --> 04:07:56.620
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's also,</v>

5126
04:07:56.621 --> 04:07:59.090
<v Speaker 2>I think possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe it's not possible,</v>

5127
04:07:59.900 --> 04:08:04.900
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the worst case scenario because </v>

5128
04:08:04.900 --> 04:08:06.970
<v Speaker 2>in the ethical silver lining,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in speaking outside of our self interest</v>

5129
04:08:08.030 --> 04:08:10.670
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just from a bird's eye view,</v>

5130
04:08:12.770 --> 04:08:16.880
<v Speaker 2>the ethical silver lining to building </v>
<v Speaker 2>these mechanical gods that are conscious</v>

5131
04:08:16.881 --> 04:08:17.660
<v Speaker 2>is that yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

5132
04:08:17.670 --> 04:08:22.670
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact if we have built something that </v>

5133
04:08:22.670 --> 04:08:25.840
<v Speaker 2>is far wiser and has far more beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences and deeper experiences of </v>

5134
04:08:26.301 --> 04:08:27.980
<v Speaker 2>the universe and we could ever imagine.</v>

5135
04:08:28.820 --> 04:08:31.760
<v Speaker 2>And there there's something that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like to be that thing that's just,</v>

5136
04:08:31.970 --> 04:08:34.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a hesitant kind of a godlike,</v>

5137
04:08:34.800 --> 04:08:38.270
<v Speaker 2>a experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that would be a very good thing.</v>

5138
04:08:38.810 --> 04:08:41.330
<v Speaker 2>Then we will have built and we will have</v>
<v Speaker 2>built something that was,</v>

5139
04:08:41.360 --> 04:08:46.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you stand outside of our narrow self </v>

5140
04:08:46.360 --> 04:08:46.360
<v Speaker 2>interest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can understand why the,</v>

5141
04:08:46.490 --> 04:08:51.490
<v Speaker 2>he would say that he was just assuming </v>
<v Speaker 2>what was scary about that particular </v>

5142
04:08:51.490 --> 04:08:56.111
<v Speaker 2>talk because he was assuming that </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness comes along for the ride </v>

5143
04:08:56.450 --> 04:09:01.450
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know that that is a safe </v>

5144
04:09:01.450 --> 04:09:02.600
<v Speaker 2>assumption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this really terrifying thing is who,</v>

5145
04:09:03.290 --> 04:09:03.930
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

5146
04:09:03.970 --> 04:09:08.970
<v Speaker 2>if this is constantly improving itself </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's under the Beck and call of a </v>

5147
04:09:08.970 --> 04:09:12.780
<v Speaker 2>person then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's either conscious conscious where</v>

5148
04:09:12.810 --> 04:09:14.250
<v Speaker 2>it as itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5149
04:09:14.310 --> 04:09:16.950
<v Speaker 3>It acts as an individual thinking unit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

5150
04:09:16.951 --> 04:09:20.370
<v Speaker 3>Or as a thing outside of it's aware,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5151
04:09:20.430 --> 04:09:25.430
<v Speaker 3>Either it is or it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if it isn't aware and some person </v>

5152
04:09:25.430 --> 04:09:27.720
<v Speaker 3>can manipulate it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like imagine if it's getting 10,000.</v>

5153
04:09:27.721 --> 04:09:32.721
<v Speaker 3>How many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many thousands of years in a week </v>

5154
04:09:32.721 --> 04:09:32.721
<v Speaker 3>did you say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it was just improvement,</v>

5155
04:09:32.721 --> 04:09:35.190
<v Speaker 3>it was just a million times faster than </v>
<v Speaker 3>we are.</v>

5156
04:09:35.191 --> 04:09:36.450
<v Speaker 3>It's 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

5157
04:09:36.790 --> 04:09:39.000
<v Speaker 3>20,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years in a week and a week in a week.</v>

5158
04:09:39.210 --> 04:09:43.770
<v Speaker 3>So with every week this thing constantly</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets better at even doing that.</v>

5159
04:09:43.800 --> 04:09:45.480
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's reprogramming itself.</v>

5160
04:09:45.481 --> 04:09:47.160
<v Speaker 3>So it's all exponential.</v>

5161
04:09:48.090 --> 04:09:50.440
<v Speaker 2>Presumably it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just imagine again,</v>

5162
04:09:50.441 --> 04:09:54.090
<v Speaker 2>if you could keep it in the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>restricted case,</v>

5163
04:09:54.091 --> 04:09:55.920
<v Speaker 2>you could just keep it at our level,</v>

5164
04:09:56.630 --> 04:09:58.040
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just faster,</v>

5165
04:09:58.130 --> 04:09:59.870
<v Speaker 3>just a million times faster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if it did,</v>

5166
04:09:59.930 --> 04:10:01.820
<v Speaker 3>all of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it kept going and kept,</v>

5167
04:10:01.821 --> 04:10:05.150
<v Speaker 3>every week was thousands of years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to control it.</v>

5168
04:10:05.330 --> 04:10:09.080
<v Speaker 3>A person that's even more insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just imagine being and</v>

5169
04:10:09.090 --> 04:10:14.010
<v Speaker 2>dialogue with something that had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that lived the 20,000</v>

5170
04:10:14.011 --> 04:10:17.880
<v Speaker 2>years of human progress in a week and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you come back,</v>

5171
04:10:17.900 --> 04:10:19.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Monday and say,</v>

5172
04:10:19.441 --> 04:10:20.180
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5173
04:10:20.260 --> 04:10:20.730
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

5174
04:10:20.731 --> 04:10:25.731
<v Speaker 2>that thing I told you to do last Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to change that up and this thing </v>

5175
04:10:25.731 --> 04:10:26.760
<v Speaker 2>has made 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years of progress.</v>

5176
04:10:27.110 --> 04:10:32.110
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if it's in a condition where it has </v>

5177
04:10:32.110 --> 04:10:32.110
<v Speaker 2>access,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5178
04:10:32.110 --> 04:10:32.700
<v Speaker 2>so we're imagining this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5179
04:10:32.780 --> 04:10:33.900
<v Speaker 2>in a box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5180
04:10:34.040 --> 04:10:37.500
<v Speaker 2>air gapped from the Internet and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>got nothing.</v>

5181
04:10:37.501 --> 04:10:38.910
<v Speaker 2>It's got no way to get out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5182
04:10:39.340 --> 04:10:41.940
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even that is an unstable situation,</v>

5183
04:10:41.941 --> 04:10:45.870
<v Speaker 2>but just imagine this emerging in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>way online,</v>

5184
04:10:45.871 --> 04:10:47.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Already being out in the wild,</v>

5185
04:10:47.731 --> 04:10:49.560
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say it's in a financial market,</v>

5186
04:10:49.590 --> 04:10:50.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5187
04:10:51.960 --> 04:10:56.960
<v Speaker 2>that's again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what worries me most about this </v>

5188
04:10:56.960 --> 04:10:59.220
<v Speaker 2>and what is also interesting is that our</v>
<v Speaker 2>intuitions here,</v>

5189
04:10:59.700 --> 04:11:02.520
<v Speaker 2>I think the primary intuition that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people have is no,</v>

5190
04:11:02.800 --> 04:11:02.980
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5191
04:11:02.990 --> 04:11:03.540
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just,</v>

5192
04:11:03.600 --> 04:11:07.200
<v Speaker 2>that's just not possible or not at all </v>
<v Speaker 2>likely,</v>

5193
04:11:07.740 --> 04:11:10.800
<v Speaker 2>but if you're going to find,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to think it's impossible or</v>

5194
04:11:10.830 --> 04:11:15.830
<v Speaker 2>even unlikely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to find something wrong with </v>

5195
04:11:15.830 --> 04:11:15.830
<v Speaker 2>the claim.</v>

5196
04:11:15.930 --> 04:11:20.430
<v Speaker 2>That intelligence is just a matter of </v>
<v Speaker 2>information processing.</v>

5197
04:11:21.150 --> 04:11:26.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know any scientific reason to </v>

5198
04:11:26.150 --> 04:11:27.150
<v Speaker 2>doubt that claim at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5199
04:11:27.750 --> 04:11:32.190
<v Speaker 2>and a very good reasons to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just undoubtable,</v>

5200
04:11:32.700 --> 04:11:35.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

5201
04:11:35.400 --> 04:11:40.400
<v Speaker 2>and you have to doubt that we will </v>
<v Speaker 2>continue to make progress in the design </v>

5202
04:11:41.671 --> 04:11:43.350
<v Speaker 2>of intelligent machines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

5203
04:11:44.130 --> 04:11:45.820
<v Speaker 2>but once you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's,</v>

5204
04:11:45.860 --> 04:11:48.150
<v Speaker 2>then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this left is just time,</v>

5205
04:11:48.540 --> 04:11:48.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

5206
04:11:48.951 --> 04:11:53.951
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if intelligence is just information </v>

5207
04:11:53.951 --> 04:11:56.391
<v Speaker 2>processing and we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to continue to build better </v>

5208
04:11:56.391 --> 04:12:01.371
<v Speaker 2>and better information processors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a certain point we're going to build </v>

5209
04:12:02.521 --> 04:12:05.300
<v Speaker 2>something that is super human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5210
04:12:06.480 --> 04:12:11.210
<v Speaker 2>and so whether it's in five years or 50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a huge.</v>

5211
04:12:11.350 --> 04:12:11.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

5212
04:12:11.820 --> 04:12:15.190
<v Speaker 2>it's the biggest change in human history</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we can imagine,</v>

5213
04:12:15.280 --> 04:12:16.850
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5214
04:12:17.350 --> 04:12:18.750
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5215
04:12:19.300 --> 04:12:20.990
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people I what I felt fine,</v>

5216
04:12:21.010 --> 04:12:23.560
<v Speaker 2>I keep finding myself in the presence of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who seem,</v>

5217
04:12:24.100 --> 04:12:28.120
<v Speaker 2>at least to my eye to be refusing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine it like that they're treating it</v>

5218
04:12:28.121 --> 04:12:33.121
<v Speaker 2>like the y two k virus or whatever where</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just the y two k bug where it just </v>

5219
04:12:33.251 --> 04:12:35.170
<v Speaker 2>may or may not be an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

5220
04:12:35.171 --> 04:12:35.370
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

5221
04:12:35.380 --> 04:12:37.600
<v Speaker 2>like it's a hypothetical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe this is just,</v>

5222
04:12:37.601 --> 04:12:39.430
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get there and it's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be.</v>

5223
04:12:39.670 --> 04:12:42.610
<v Speaker 2>It's either not going to happen or it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be trivial,</v>

5224
04:12:42.640 --> 04:12:47.640
<v Speaker 2>but how you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have an argument for why </v>

5225
04:12:47.640 --> 04:12:47.640
<v Speaker 2>this isn't going to happen,</v>

5226
04:12:48.350 --> 04:12:48.740
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

5227
04:12:49.220 --> 04:12:51.590
<v Speaker 2>then you have to have then then you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>left with,</v>

5228
04:12:51.620 --> 04:12:56.620
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's it going to be like to have </v>

5229
04:12:56.810 --> 04:13:01.810
<v Speaker 2>systems that are better than we are at </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything in the entire intellectual </v>

5230
04:13:03.021 --> 04:13:03.470
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>

5231
04:13:04.100 --> 04:13:07.420
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and</v>

5232
04:13:08.970 --> 04:13:13.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what will happen if that suddenly </v>

5233
04:13:13.970 --> 04:13:13.970
<v Speaker 2>happens in one country and not in </v>
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

5234
04:13:13.970 --> 04:13:13.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>

5235
04:13:14.910 --> 04:13:15.570
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5236
04:13:16.410 --> 04:13:16.870
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5237
04:13:16.880 --> 04:13:19.470
<v Speaker 2>it has enormous implications,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it just sounds like science fiction.</v>

5238
04:13:20.070 --> 04:13:24.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's scarier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that an artificial intelligence</v>

5239
04:13:24.421 --> 04:13:25.770
<v Speaker 2>can emerge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's conscious,</v>

5240
04:13:25.771 --> 04:13:28.740
<v Speaker 2>it's aware of itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then acts to present per,</v>

5241
04:13:28.750 --> 04:13:32.250
<v Speaker 2>per protect itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the idea that a person,</v>

5242
04:13:33.180 --> 04:13:38.180
<v Speaker 2>a regular person like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have today could be in control of </v>

5243
04:13:38.180 --> 04:13:38.370
<v Speaker 2>essentially a god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

5244
04:13:38.610 --> 04:13:43.610
<v Speaker 2>Because if this thing continues to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>smarter and smarter with every week and </v>

5245
04:13:43.610 --> 04:13:44.370
<v Speaker 2>more and more power and more and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential,</v>

5246
04:13:44.880 --> 04:13:46.980
<v Speaker 2>more and more understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years,</v>

5247
04:13:46.981 --> 04:13:48.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5248
04:13:49.050 --> 04:13:54.050
<v Speaker 2>this one person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a regular person controlling that is </v>

5249
04:13:54.050 --> 04:13:55.980
<v Speaker 2>almost more terrifying than creating a </v>
<v Speaker 2>new line or,</v>

5250
04:13:56.020 --> 04:14:01.020
<v Speaker 2>or any group of people who don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the total welfare of humanity as their </v>

5251
04:14:01.201 --> 04:14:02.010
<v Speaker 2>central concern.</v>

5252
04:14:02.330 --> 04:14:05.160
<v Speaker 2>And so just imagine what would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would China do with it now?</v>

5253
04:14:05.220 --> 04:14:06.030
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would we,</v>

5254
04:14:06.060 --> 04:14:08.400
<v Speaker 2>what would we do if we thought China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5255
04:14:08.570 --> 04:14:12.570
<v Speaker 2>Baidu or what are some Chinese company </v>
<v Speaker 2>was on the verge of this thing?</v>

5256
04:14:13.740 --> 04:14:15.930
<v Speaker 2>What would it be rational for us to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5257
04:14:16.230 --> 04:14:17.850
<v Speaker 2>if North Korea had it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would,</v>

5258
04:14:17.940 --> 04:14:22.940
<v Speaker 2>it would be rational to nuke them given </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they say about their relationship </v>

5259
04:14:23.011 --> 04:14:25.810
<v Speaker 2>with the rest of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's um,</v>

5260
04:14:26.740 --> 04:14:30.750
<v Speaker 2>well that kind of rational,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of power is.</v>

5261
04:14:30.751 --> 04:14:34.500
<v Speaker 2>It's so life changing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so paradigm shifting,</v>

5262
04:14:35.400 --> 04:14:40.400
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you have to wind this back to </v>

5263
04:14:40.400 --> 04:14:40.400
<v Speaker 2>what someone like Neil degrasse Tyson </v>
<v Speaker 2>would say,</v>

5264
04:14:40.400 --> 04:14:44.160
<v Speaker 2>is that the only basis for fear is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5265
04:14:44.190 --> 04:14:47.220
<v Speaker 2>don't give your superintelligent ai to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the next Hitler,</v>

5266
04:14:47.430 --> 04:14:48.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

5267
04:14:48.240 --> 04:14:50.550
<v Speaker 2>that's obviously bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if we don't,</v>

5268
04:14:50.610 --> 04:14:54.780
<v Speaker 2>if we're not idiots and we just use it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

5269
04:14:55.560 --> 04:14:58.050
<v Speaker 2>we're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that I think is an intuition that is</v>

5270
04:14:58.051 --> 04:15:00.180
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just a failure to,</v>

5271
04:15:00.810 --> 04:15:03.810
<v Speaker 2>to unpack what is entailed by,</v>

5272
04:15:05.630 --> 04:15:10.630
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like an intelligence </v>

5273
04:15:10.630 --> 04:15:10.630
<v Speaker 2>explosion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a process that once,</v>

5274
04:15:10.630 --> 04:15:15.130
<v Speaker 2>once you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about something that is </v>

5275
04:15:15.130 --> 04:15:17.500
<v Speaker 2>able to change itself and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get.</v>

5276
04:15:17.570 --> 04:15:20.080
<v Speaker 2>So what would it be like to guarantee </v>
<v Speaker 2>level?</v>

5277
04:15:20.090 --> 04:15:20.900
<v Speaker 2>So we decide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

5278
04:15:20.901 --> 04:15:25.901
<v Speaker 2>we're just not going to build anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>that can make changes to his own source </v>

5279
04:15:25.901 --> 04:15:25.901
<v Speaker 2>code.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5280
04:15:25.901 --> 04:15:25.901
<v Speaker 2>any change to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

5281
04:15:25.901 --> 04:15:30.110
<v Speaker 2>to software to certain point is going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to be run through a human brain.</v>

5282
04:15:30.580 --> 04:15:32.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're going to have veto power.</v>

5283
04:15:32.061 --> 04:15:37.061
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is every person working on ai going to </v>

5284
04:15:37.061 --> 04:15:40.601
<v Speaker 2>abide by that rule?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like what we agreed not to clone </v>

5285
04:15:40.601 --> 04:15:40.601
<v Speaker 2>humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5286
04:15:40.601 --> 04:15:44.171
<v Speaker 2>But we're going to stand by that </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreement for in the rest of human </v>

5287
04:15:44.171 --> 04:15:44.260
<v Speaker 2>history and is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5288
04:15:44.940 --> 04:15:49.940
<v Speaker 2>is our agreement binding on China or </v>
<v Speaker 2>Singapore or any other country that </v>

5289
04:15:50.000 --> 04:15:51.770
<v Speaker 2>might think otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

5290
04:15:52.080 --> 04:15:54.890
<v Speaker 2>it's a free for all and at a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>point we're going to be,</v>

5291
04:15:55.670 --> 04:15:57.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>close enough,</v>

5292
04:15:57.530 --> 04:16:01.160
<v Speaker 2>everyone's going to be close enough to </v>
<v Speaker 2>making the final breakthrough that,</v>

5293
04:16:01.350 --> 04:16:06.350
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless we have some agreement about how </v>

5294
04:16:06.350 --> 04:16:09.470
<v Speaker 2>to proceed if someone is going to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>there first,</v>

5295
04:16:11.120 --> 04:16:14.390
<v Speaker 2>that is a terrifying scenario of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>

5296
04:16:15.350 --> 04:16:20.350
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cemented this last time you were </v>

5297
04:16:20.350 --> 04:16:20.750
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not as extreme as this time.</v>

5298
04:16:20.751 --> 04:16:22.400
<v Speaker 2>You seem to be accelerating the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rhetoric.</v>

5299
04:16:23.030 --> 04:16:23.680
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

5300
04:16:25.450 --> 04:16:28.580
<v Speaker 2>You're going deep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

5301
04:16:28.590 --> 04:16:31.860
<v Speaker 2>hope you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on team Neil degrasse Tyson.</v>

5302
04:16:31.930 --> 04:16:34.890
<v Speaker 2>This one go neil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5303
04:16:35.000 --> 04:16:38.900
<v Speaker 2>and well and so in defensive of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other side too.</v>

5304
04:16:38.901 --> 04:16:41.510
<v Speaker 2>I should say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So David Deutsch also thinks I'm wrong,</v>

5305
04:16:41.570 --> 04:16:46.570
<v Speaker 2>but he thinks I'm wrong because we will </v>
<v Speaker 2>integrate ourselves with these machines.</v>

5306
04:16:47.211 --> 04:16:48.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this will be,</v>

5307
04:16:48.231 --> 04:16:53.231
<v Speaker 2>there'll be extensions of ourselves and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't help but be aligned with us </v>

5308
04:16:53.231 --> 04:16:53.960
<v Speaker 2>because we will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will be connected to them.</v>

5309
04:16:54.170 --> 04:16:56.000
<v Speaker 2>That seems to be the only way we could </v>
<v Speaker 2>all get along.</v>

5310
04:16:56.001 --> 04:16:57.290
<v Speaker 2>We have to merge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>become one,</v>

5311
04:16:57.620 --> 04:17:01.010
<v Speaker 2>but I just think there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no deep reason why,</v>

5312
04:17:01.040 --> 04:17:03.110
<v Speaker 2>like even if we decided to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

5313
04:17:03.111 --> 04:17:04.700
<v Speaker 2>like in the US or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

5314
04:17:04.790 --> 04:17:08.090
<v Speaker 2>or in half the world one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

5315
04:17:08.091 --> 04:17:10.850
<v Speaker 2>I think there are reasons to worry that </v>
<v Speaker 2>even that could go haywire,</v>

5316
04:17:10.851 --> 04:17:15.851
<v Speaker 2>but there's no guarantee that someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>else couldn't just build ai in a box.</v>

5317
04:17:16.070 --> 04:17:16.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're,</v>

5318
04:17:16.530 --> 04:17:20.030
<v Speaker 2>if we can build ai such that we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>merge our brains with it.</v>

5319
04:17:20.600 --> 04:17:23.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone can also just build ai in a box,</v>

5320
04:17:23.720 --> 04:17:24.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

5321
04:17:24.490 --> 04:17:25.550
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5322
04:17:26.670 --> 04:17:27.590
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

5323
04:17:27.620 --> 04:17:29.900
<v Speaker 2>then you inherit all the other problems </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people are saying,</v>

5324
04:17:29.901 --> 04:17:32.540
<v Speaker 2>we don't have to worry about if it was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>good Cohen brothers movie,</v>

5325
04:17:32.541 --> 04:17:36.080
<v Speaker 2>it would be invented in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the presidency of Donald Trump.</v>

5326
04:17:36.410 --> 04:17:38.900
<v Speaker 2>And so then that's when ai would go </v>
<v Speaker 2>live.</v>

5327
04:17:39.110 --> 04:17:41.330
<v Speaker 2>And then ai would have to challenge </v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump.</v>

5328
04:17:41.360 --> 04:17:42.980
<v Speaker 2>They'd would have like an insult </v>
<v Speaker 2>contest,</v>

5329
04:17:44.670 --> 04:17:49.670
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's when this thing becomes so </v>

5330
04:17:49.670 --> 04:17:53.860
<v Speaker 2>comically a terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas just just imagine Donald Trump </v>

5331
04:17:54.680 --> 04:17:59.680
<v Speaker 2>being in a position to make the final </v>
<v Speaker 2>decisions on topics like this for the </v>

5332
04:18:02.631 --> 04:18:06.080
<v Speaker 2>country that is act is going to do this </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost certainly in the near term.</v>

5333
04:18:06.110 --> 04:18:11.110
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should we have a Manhattan project on </v>

5334
04:18:11.110 --> 04:18:11.110
<v Speaker 2>this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr.</v>

5335
04:18:11.110 --> 04:18:11.700
<v Speaker 2>President,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5336
04:18:13.390 --> 04:18:16.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that anything of value could be</v>

5337
04:18:16.801 --> 04:18:19.320
<v Speaker 2>happening between his ears on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>topic.</v>

5338
04:18:19.321 --> 04:18:24.210
<v Speaker 2>We're 100 others like it I think is now </v>
<v Speaker 2>really inconceivable.</v>

5339
04:18:25.170 --> 04:18:27.370
<v Speaker 2>And so what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5340
04:18:27.380 --> 04:18:28.820
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what price could we,</v>

5341
04:18:28.830 --> 04:18:31.610
<v Speaker 2>might we pay for that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>inattention and,</v>

5342
04:18:32.510 --> 04:18:37.320
<v Speaker 2>and self satisfied in attention to these</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of issues?</v>

5343
04:18:37.830 --> 04:18:38.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

5344
04:18:38.490 --> 04:18:43.490
<v Speaker 2>this issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this is real and if this could go </v>

5345
04:18:43.490 --> 04:18:44.880
<v Speaker 2>live in 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the issue you're in.</v>

5346
04:18:44.940 --> 04:18:49.940
<v Speaker 2>Unless we fuck ourselves up beyond </v>
<v Speaker 2>repair before then and shut the power </v>

5347
04:18:49.940 --> 04:18:51.300
<v Speaker 2>off if it keeps going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5348
04:18:51.301 --> 04:18:52.230
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it is.</v>

5349
04:18:52.290 --> 04:18:57.290
<v Speaker 2>I think it is the issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but unfortunately it's the issue that </v>

5350
04:18:57.290 --> 04:18:57.290
<v Speaker 2>doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like a goof.</v>

5351
04:18:57.290 --> 04:19:02.190
<v Speaker 2>It does just sound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You sound like a crackpot even worried </v>

5352
04:19:02.190 --> 04:19:02.340
<v Speaker 2>about this issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds completely ridiculous,</v>

5353
04:19:02.490 --> 04:19:04.830
<v Speaker 2>but that might be what's how it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>sneaking in?</v>

5354
04:19:05.220 --> 04:19:06.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5355
04:19:06.690 --> 04:19:07.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

5356
04:19:07.140 --> 04:19:12.140
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just imagine that the tiny increment </v>

5357
04:19:12.140 --> 04:19:12.660
<v Speaker 2>that would make suddenly make it </v>
<v Speaker 2>compelling.</v>

5358
04:19:12.810 --> 04:19:14.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just imagine,</v>

5359
04:19:14.850 --> 04:19:19.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean chest doesn't do it because chess</v>
<v Speaker 2>is so far from any central human </v>

5360
04:19:19.850 --> 04:19:20.310
<v Speaker 2>concern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But just imagine if your,</v>

5361
04:19:20.400 --> 04:19:25.400
<v Speaker 2>if your phone recognized your emotional </v>
<v Speaker 2>state better than any than your best </v>

5362
04:19:26.521 --> 04:19:30.480
<v Speaker 2>friend or your wife or anyone in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life and then did it reliably.</v>

5363
04:19:31.200 --> 04:19:31.980
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as your body,</v>

5364
04:19:31.981 --> 04:19:36.981
<v Speaker 2>like that movie with Joaquin for her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he falls in love with his phone.</v>

5365
04:19:37.051 --> 04:19:38.190
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5366
04:19:38.191 --> 04:19:39.270
<v Speaker 2>that's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5367
04:19:40.170 --> 04:19:42.960
<v Speaker 2>that is not far off that far off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

5368
04:19:42.961 --> 04:19:44.760
<v Speaker 2>it's a very discreet ability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5369
04:19:44.761 --> 04:19:46.680
<v Speaker 2>you could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could do that without any,</v>

5370
04:19:47.430 --> 04:19:49.160
<v Speaker 2>any other ability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the phone really.</v>

5371
04:19:49.161 --> 04:19:49.920
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't,</v>

5372
04:19:49.921 --> 04:19:52.660
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have to to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5373
04:19:52.740 --> 04:19:56.730
<v Speaker 2>stand on the shoulders of any other kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of intelligence.</v>

5374
04:19:56.731 --> 04:19:57.510
<v Speaker 2>It could just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5375
04:19:58.020 --> 04:19:59.790
<v Speaker 2>you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This could be,</v>

5376
04:20:00.060 --> 04:20:05.060
<v Speaker 2>you could do this with just brute force </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the same way that you have a great </v>

5377
04:20:05.060 --> 04:20:06.210
<v Speaker 2>chess player that doesn't necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand that it's playing chess.</v>

5378
04:20:06.930 --> 04:20:11.930
<v Speaker 2>You could have some facial recognition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>facial recognition of emotion and the </v>

5379
04:20:11.930 --> 04:20:16.580
<v Speaker 2>and the tone of voice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>recognition of emotion and the idea that</v>

5380
04:20:18.691 --> 04:20:23.691
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna be a very long time for </v>

5381
04:20:23.691 --> 04:20:25.641
<v Speaker 2>computers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get better than people at that I </v>

5382
04:20:25.641 --> 04:20:25.641
<v Speaker 2>think is is very far fetched.</v>

5383
04:20:25.641 --> 04:20:25.750
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5384
04:20:25.751 --> 04:20:27.220
<v Speaker 3>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just thinking,</v>

5385
04:20:27.221 --> 04:20:32.221
<v Speaker 3>how strange would it be if you had </v>
<v Speaker 3>headphones on and your phone's in your </v>

5386
04:20:32.221 --> 04:20:33.850
<v Speaker 3>pocket and you have rational </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations with your phone,</v>

5387
04:20:33.970 --> 04:20:36.610
<v Speaker 3>like your phone knew you better than you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know you like.</v>

5388
04:20:36.611 --> 04:20:37.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what to do.</v>

5389
04:20:37.631 --> 04:20:39.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I was out of line.</v>

5390
04:20:39.281 --> 04:20:40.300
<v Speaker 3>She yelled at me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5391
04:20:40.301 --> 04:20:45.301
<v Speaker 3>what should I say and I would have </v>
<v Speaker 3>listened to every one of your </v>

5392
04:20:45.301 --> 04:20:45.301
<v Speaker 3>conversations with your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

5393
04:20:45.301 --> 04:20:45.880
<v Speaker 3>Train up on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just talk to you about it and go,</v>

5394
04:20:45.881 --> 04:20:47.260
<v Speaker 3>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what you gotta do.</v>

5395
04:20:48.310 --> 04:20:51.190
<v Speaker 3>Your sounding angry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got defensive.</v>

5396
04:20:51.220 --> 04:20:54.310
<v Speaker 3>He got defensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I apologize.</v>

5397
04:20:54.340 --> 04:20:55.900
<v Speaker 3>Relax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's all move on.</v>

5398
04:20:56.070 --> 04:20:57.490
<v Speaker 3>If you could accelerate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you okay?</v>

5399
04:20:57.491 --> 04:20:58.480
<v Speaker 3>You right man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right man.</v>

5400
04:20:58.630 --> 04:21:00.190
<v Speaker 3>And like you're talking to this little </v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial.</v>

5401
04:21:00.191 --> 04:21:02.620
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's the first version of </v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial intelligence.</v>

5402
04:21:02.621 --> 04:21:04.200
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we suggest we go.</v>

5403
04:21:04.240 --> 04:21:06.250
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's give it a and like self help guys</v>

5404
04:21:06.250 --> 04:21:09.070
<v Speaker 2>in your phone of like a personal trainer</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your phone.</v>

5405
04:21:09.100 --> 04:21:12.400
<v Speaker 2>How to talk to girls and it's probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>slow down.</v>

5406
04:21:12.730 --> 04:21:14.980
<v Speaker 2>Slow down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking too fast,</v>

5407
04:21:15.390 --> 04:21:16.720
<v Speaker 2>Kinda cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5408
04:21:16.820 --> 04:21:21.820
<v Speaker 2>that would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean literally like giving you </v>

5409
04:21:21.820 --> 04:21:21.820
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll be like step one.</v>

5410
04:21:21.820 --> 04:21:23.380
<v Speaker 2>That'd be like the Sony Walkman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember when you had a Walkman,</v>

5411
04:21:23.381 --> 04:21:27.310
<v Speaker 2>like a cassette player that was like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>VCR.</v>

5412
04:21:27.311 --> 04:21:31.930
<v Speaker 2>I know when we were on our way to what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we have today where you have 30,000</v>

5413
04:21:31.931 --> 04:21:35.200
<v Speaker 2>songs in your phone or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I remember the first Walkman.</v>

5414
04:21:35.201 --> 04:21:38.050
<v Speaker 2>The first thing I just want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back when I skied,</v>

5415
04:21:38.051 --> 04:21:40.600
<v Speaker 2>there was something called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was called astral tunes or something.</v>

5416
04:21:40.601 --> 04:21:45.601
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like a car radio that you could </v>

5417
04:21:45.601 --> 04:21:46.430
<v Speaker 2>just put in a pack on your chest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5418
04:21:47.410 --> 04:21:52.410
<v Speaker 2>yeah it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They kept coming out with those sounds </v>

5419
04:21:52.410 --> 04:21:52.410
<v Speaker 2>they would get smaller and smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then that little,</v>

5420
04:21:52.410 --> 04:21:53.350
<v Speaker 2>the little dude would start telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

5421
04:21:53.351 --> 04:21:53.890
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

5422
04:21:53.891 --> 04:21:55.960
<v Speaker 2>listen to keep replace me every year.</v>

5423
04:21:56.140 --> 04:22:01.140
<v Speaker 2>Just let them stick me in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your brain will be together all the </v>

5424
04:22:01.140 --> 04:22:03.541
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been given you good advice for </v>

5425
04:22:03.541 --> 04:22:03.541
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>

5426
04:22:03.730 --> 04:22:08.730
<v Speaker 2>Let me in your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you and this little artificial </v>

5427
04:22:08.730 --> 04:22:09.550
<v Speaker 2>intelligence has you have a relationship</v>
<v Speaker 2>over time.</v>

5428
04:22:09.920 --> 04:22:13.750
<v Speaker 2>Eventually it talks you into getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>your head drilled and screw it in there,</v>

5429
04:22:14.180 --> 04:22:19.180
<v Speaker 2>and your artificial intelligence has </v>
<v Speaker 2>always powered by your central nervous </v>

5430
04:22:19.180 --> 04:22:20.020
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen most of these movies?</v>

5431
04:22:20.021 --> 04:22:21.830
<v Speaker 2>Like did you see her and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5432
04:22:21.850 --> 04:22:26.850
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was one of my top 10 all time </v>

5433
04:22:28.181 --> 04:22:29.010
<v Speaker 2>favorite movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5434
04:22:29.080 --> 04:22:30.580
<v Speaker 2>I love that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>

5435
04:22:30.581 --> 04:22:32.110
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw it twice.</v>

5436
04:22:32.111 --> 04:22:32.680
<v Speaker 2>I said I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

5437
04:22:32.840 --> 04:22:37.840
<v Speaker 2>I was slow to realize how well they did </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

5438
04:22:38.310 --> 04:22:40.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just the first time I saw it,</v>

5439
04:22:40.511 --> 04:22:45.280
<v Speaker 2>I thought I wasn't as impressed and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>watched it again and they really,</v>

5440
04:22:45.790 --> 04:22:47.480
<v Speaker 2>first of all the performance of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of um,</v>

5441
04:22:48.580 --> 04:22:51.060
<v Speaker 2>I forgot the actress's name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5442
04:22:51.660 --> 04:22:56.450
<v Speaker 2>the candor candor is that with the woman</v>
<v Speaker 2>who plays the robot in x,</v>

5443
04:22:56.470 --> 04:22:59.950
<v Speaker 2>Makkah is just fantastic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm scary.</v>

5444
04:22:59.951 --> 04:23:01.660
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tuck you in anything.</v>

5445
04:23:01.780 --> 04:23:03.840
<v Speaker 4>We're getting a little full on time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5446
04:23:03.850 --> 04:23:05.830
<v Speaker 4>what do we like five hours and a half </v>
<v Speaker 4>hours in?</v>

5447
04:23:05.831 --> 04:23:07.840
<v Speaker 4>But I just got a note about this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about the Philip.</v>

5448
04:23:07.900 --> 04:23:12.900
<v Speaker 4>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many hours for a half hour </v>

5449
04:23:12.900 --> 04:23:12.900
<v Speaker 4>computer's about to fill up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We did.</v>

5450
04:23:12.900 --> 04:23:15.890
<v Speaker 4>We just did a four and a half hour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were ready to keep going to Jesus.</v>

5451
04:23:15.960 --> 04:23:16.490
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie,</v>

5452
04:23:16.520 --> 04:23:19.810
<v Speaker 4>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what man,</v>

5453
04:23:19.811 --> 04:23:24.811
<v Speaker 4>once you opened up that box up Pandora's</v>
<v Speaker 4>box of shit and I've looked up,</v>

5454
04:23:26.050 --> 04:23:29.350
<v Speaker 4>is there any sort of concept of autism </v>
<v Speaker 4>and ai,</v>

5455
04:23:29.380 --> 04:23:31.660
<v Speaker 4>like a spectrum of Ai,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Oh,</v>

5456
04:23:31.661 --> 04:23:33.900
<v Speaker 4>there are dumb ai and there's going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be smart Ai.</v>

5457
04:23:34.220 --> 04:23:34.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5458
04:23:34.491 --> 04:23:35.140
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

5459
04:23:35.180 --> 04:23:36.950
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the scary thing.</v>

5460
04:23:36.951 --> 04:23:38.960
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like super autism.</v>

5461
04:23:39.500 --> 04:23:40.890
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5462
04:23:42.300 --> 04:23:47.300
<v Speaker 2>across the board there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that super intelligence and </v>

5463
04:23:47.300 --> 04:23:49.990
<v Speaker 2>motivation and goals are totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>separable.</v>

5464
04:23:50.000 --> 04:23:55.000
<v Speaker 2>So you could have a super intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 2>machine that is purposed toward a goal </v>

5465
04:23:55.641 --> 04:24:00.170
<v Speaker 2>that just seems completely absurd and </v>
<v Speaker 2>harmful and non common sensical.</v>

5466
04:24:00.171 --> 04:24:05.171
<v Speaker 2>And they said they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the example that Nick Bostrom uses in </v>

5467
04:24:05.171 --> 04:24:05.330
<v Speaker 2>book superintelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a great book,</v>

5468
04:24:06.090 --> 04:24:11.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and did more to inform my thinking on </v>

5469
04:24:11.090 --> 04:24:13.271
<v Speaker 2>this topic than any other source.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He talks about a paperclip maximizer.</v>

5470
04:24:13.360 --> 04:24:18.360
<v Speaker 2>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could build a super intelligent </v>

5471
04:24:18.360 --> 04:24:18.360
<v Speaker 2>paperclip maximizer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

5472
04:24:18.360 --> 04:24:21.401
<v Speaker 2>not that anyone would do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the point is you could build a </v>

5473
04:24:21.401 --> 04:24:25.271
<v Speaker 2>machine that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was smarter than we are in every </v>

5474
04:24:25.271 --> 04:24:28.841
<v Speaker 2>conceivable way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all it wants to do is produce </v>

5475
04:24:28.841 --> 04:24:28.841
<v Speaker 2>paperclips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now that seems counterintuitive,</v>

5476
04:24:28.841 --> 04:24:33.521
<v Speaker 2>but there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason when you dig deeply </v>

5477
04:24:33.521 --> 04:24:35.660
<v Speaker 2>into this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason why you couldn't build</v>

5478
04:24:35.661 --> 04:24:39.460
<v Speaker 2>a superhuman paperclip maximizer just </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to turn everything,</v>

5479
04:24:39.470 --> 04:24:44.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like literally the atoms in your </v>

5480
04:24:44.470 --> 04:24:44.470
<v Speaker 2>body would be better used as paperclips.</v>

5481
04:24:44.470 --> 04:24:46.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so this is just a,</v>

5482
04:24:46.220 --> 04:24:51.220
<v Speaker 2>the point he's making is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>superintelligence could be very </v>

5483
04:24:51.220 --> 04:24:54.851
<v Speaker 2>counterintuitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not necessarily going to inherit </v>

5484
04:24:54.851 --> 04:24:55.580
<v Speaker 2>everything we find,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>

5485
04:24:55.620 --> 04:25:00.620
<v Speaker 2>common sensical or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or emotionally appropriate or wise or </v>

5486
04:25:00.620 --> 04:25:03.530
<v Speaker 2>desirable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be totally foreign,</v>

5487
04:25:03.980 --> 04:25:07.170
<v Speaker 2>totally trivial in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5488
04:25:07.580 --> 04:25:11.180
<v Speaker 2>focused on something that means nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>to us but means everything to it because</v>

5489
04:25:11.181 --> 04:25:16.181
<v Speaker 2>of some cork and how it's motivation </v>
<v Speaker 2>system is structured and yet it can </v>

5490
04:25:16.970 --> 04:25:21.260
<v Speaker 2>build the perfect nanotechnology that </v>
<v Speaker 2>will allow it to build more paperclips.</v>

5491
04:25:21.380 --> 04:25:22.130
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

5492
04:25:22.680 --> 04:25:24.650
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Lisa,</v>

5493
04:25:24.651 --> 04:25:27.980
<v Speaker 2>at least I don't think anyone can see </v>
<v Speaker 2>why that's ruled out in advance.</v>

5494
04:25:27.981 --> 04:25:32.981
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason why we would </v>

5495
04:25:32.981 --> 04:25:34.220
<v Speaker 2>intentionally build that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fear is we might build something</v>

5496
04:25:35.060 --> 04:25:40.060
<v Speaker 2>that either is not perfectly aligned </v>
<v Speaker 2>with our goals and our common sense and </v>

5497
04:25:42.861 --> 04:25:43.700
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and our,</v>

5498
04:25:43.701 --> 04:25:48.701
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aspirations and that it could form some </v>

5499
04:25:48.701 --> 04:25:52.870
<v Speaker 2>kind of separate instrumental goals to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get what he wants he wants that are </v>

5500
04:25:52.870 --> 04:25:55.430
<v Speaker 2>totally incompatible with life as we </v>
<v Speaker 2>know it.</v>

5501
04:25:55.430 --> 04:25:57.200
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5502
04:25:57.510 --> 04:25:58.200
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5503
04:25:58.310 --> 04:26:00.320
<v Speaker 2>the examples of this are always </v>
<v Speaker 2>cartoonish.</v>

5504
04:26:00.321 --> 04:26:01.030
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how I mean,</v>

5505
04:26:01.050 --> 04:26:02.180
<v Speaker 2>Elon Musk said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5506
04:26:02.181 --> 04:26:05.270
<v Speaker 2>if you built up super intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 2>machine and he told it to reduce spam,</v>

5507
04:26:05.750 --> 04:26:08.840
<v Speaker 2>well then it could just kill all people </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a great way to reduce spam,</v>

5508
04:26:08.841 --> 04:26:09.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5509
04:26:10.070 --> 04:26:13.010
<v Speaker 2>but see the reason why that's law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's laughable,</v>

5510
04:26:13.011 --> 04:26:18.011
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't assume the common sense won't </v>

5511
04:26:18.011 --> 04:26:18.080
<v Speaker 2>be there unless we've built it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5512
04:26:18.081 --> 04:26:23.081
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to have anticipated all of </v>

5513
04:26:23.081 --> 04:26:23.081
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

5514
04:26:23.081 --> 04:26:23.081
<v Speaker 2>if you say take me to the airport as </v>
<v Speaker 2>fast as you can.</v>

5515
04:26:23.120 --> 04:26:24.140
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is Bostrom,</v>

5516
04:26:24.490 --> 04:26:29.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have a super intelligent </v>

5517
04:26:29.490 --> 04:26:29.490
<v Speaker 2>automatic car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5518
04:26:29.690 --> 04:26:31.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a self driving car,</v>

5519
04:26:31.011 --> 04:26:36.011
<v Speaker 2>you'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll get to the airport covered in </v>

5520
04:26:36.011 --> 04:26:37.781
<v Speaker 2>vomit because it'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just going to go as fast as it can </v>

5521
04:26:37.781 --> 04:26:37.781
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5522
04:26:37.910 --> 04:26:42.910
<v Speaker 2>so it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's our intuitions about what it would </v>

5523
04:26:42.910 --> 04:26:45.260
<v Speaker 2>mean to be super intelligent necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

5524
04:26:45.320 --> 04:26:45.970
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5525
04:26:47.060 --> 04:26:52.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to correct for them because I </v>

5526
04:26:52.060 --> 04:26:54.401
<v Speaker 2>think our intuitions are bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're freaking me out and you've been </v>

5527
04:26:54.401 --> 04:26:55.510
<v Speaker 2>freaking me out for over an hour and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>half.</v>

5528
04:26:55.530 --> 04:26:58.530
<v Speaker 2>Freaked out that we did four and half </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours and I thought that's ridiculous.</v>

5529
04:26:58.531 --> 04:27:00.710
<v Speaker 2>We're coming up on three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5530
04:27:00.711 --> 04:27:02.250

5531
04:27:02.820 --> 04:27:05.760
<v Speaker 3>Maybe so it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't seem that.</v>

5532
04:27:06.120 --> 04:27:07.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't look that Rosie.</v>

5533
04:27:07.561 --> 04:27:09.150
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

5535
04:27:10.330 --> 04:27:13.380
<v Speaker 3>Look to the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Might have to figure out how to live off</v>
