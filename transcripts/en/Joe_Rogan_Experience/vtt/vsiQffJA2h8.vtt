1
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.910
<v Speaker 1>Young James or in the long form we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.950
<v Speaker 1>One we can do on Papa is a motherfucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>author.</v>

3
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm a man of letters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you're an author.</v>

4
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.813
<v Speaker 1>I'm an author.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always admired that and secretly </v>

5
00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:19.284
<v Speaker 1>wished that I had not even so secretly </v>
<v Speaker 1>wish that I had the discipline to write </v>

6
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.100
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do have the discipline,</v>

7
00:00:26.101 --> 00:00:28.710
<v Speaker 1>you just have to focus it on Mac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do it.</v>

8
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.230
<v Speaker 1>How long did it take you to write this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>About two years.</v>

9
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.080
<v Speaker 1>That's too long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

10
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Cut that shorter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

11
00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:42.990
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a little pamphlet or flyer?</v>

12
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Just make a short.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all I could do.</v>

13
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.633
<v Speaker 1>How long before you started writing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book did you think about writing the </v>

14
00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:52.710
<v Speaker 1>book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

15
00:00:52.711 --> 00:00:55.220
<v Speaker 1>I've always kind of wanted to write a </v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

16
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.120
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah.</v>

17
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had pitched doing a book,</v>

18
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like six years ago.</v>

19
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.010
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much the same concept and no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>was into it.</v>

20
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.910
<v Speaker 1>And then a couple of years ago through </v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

21
00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:12.510
<v Speaker 1>three years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a publisher contacted my agent,</v>

22
00:01:12.511 --> 00:01:14.310
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they had interest.</v>

23
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.473
<v Speaker 1>So we made a book deal and that changes </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything because now someone is </v>

24
00:01:19.531 --> 00:01:21.240
<v Speaker 1>waiting for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.270
<v Speaker 1>you've got to turn stuff in and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>make books and it probably smart and you</v>

26
00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:28.224
<v Speaker 1>don't want to seem like an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you have an editor that like went </v>

27
00:01:30.571 --> 00:01:32.250
<v Speaker 1>over your stuff and said this is too </v>
<v Speaker 1>long?</v>

28
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:33.300
<v Speaker 1>This is too short?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:36.090
<v Speaker 1>They were pretty great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were pretty.</v>

30
00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:36.924
<v Speaker 1>They just left the material alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a couple little things where </v>

31
00:01:40.411 --> 00:01:41.161
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:41.161 --> 00:01:45.190
<v Speaker 1>you're repeating something or a that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But mostly it was a,</v>

33
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.050
<v Speaker 1>a grammar kind of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to say it like this?</v>

34
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.080
<v Speaker 1>This isn't technically grammatically </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

35
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.590
<v Speaker 1>Typos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of stuff.</v>

36
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.830
<v Speaker 1>They were pretty hands off about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual material.</v>

37
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.470
<v Speaker 1>And does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it a book of essays?</v>

38
00:02:01.471 --> 00:02:03.390
<v Speaker 1>Is it your life story?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

39
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.253
<v Speaker 1>It's all on family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called your dad stole my rake and </v>

40
00:02:08.491 --> 00:02:11.520
<v Speaker 1>other family dilemmas and it's broken </v>
<v Speaker 1>down by,</v>

41
00:02:11.521 --> 00:02:13.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by everyone in your family.</v>

42
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Like the basic thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a comedian,</v>

43
00:02:15.841 --> 00:02:16.674
<v Speaker 1>I've been writing about family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at all everyone's families </v>

44
00:02:18.601 --> 00:02:20.640
<v Speaker 1>for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to write about all of them.</v>

45
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:21.660
<v Speaker 1>So it's moms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dads,</v>

46
00:02:21.661 --> 00:02:22.680
<v Speaker 1>cousins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aunts,</v>

47
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.720
<v Speaker 1>uncles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all broken down chapters like that.</v>

48
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.740
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I talked a little bit about my family</v>

49
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.930
<v Speaker 1>and then I just talk about funny essays </v>
<v Speaker 1>about just life in general,</v>

50
00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:36.210
<v Speaker 1>like going on family vacations or why </v>
<v Speaker 1>are you eating your shirt?</v>

51
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly.</v>

52
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.770
<v Speaker 1>There's a really cool photographer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam Jones who's decided to get wacky.</v>

53
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.960
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.893
<v Speaker 1>this guy is like this amazing </v>
<v Speaker 1>photographer just done like clooney and </v>

55
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Damon and all these people.</v>

56
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.293
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked him if he would help him when I </v>

57
00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:54.324
<v Speaker 1>showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just taking some regular shots and </v>

58
00:02:55.951 --> 00:02:56.784
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have this idea and brought out this </v>

59
00:02:58.351 --> 00:03:03.351
<v Speaker 1>giant and put a tie on it and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just shot it.</v>

60
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.840
<v Speaker 1>And it came up pretty funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looked like dilbert or beaker.</v>

61
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.430
<v Speaker 1>I was just trying to figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing,</v>

62
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.273
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess what you're doing there is get </v>

63
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 1>people to try to figure out what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing there.</v>

64
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They stare at it and they're like,</v>

65
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.900
<v Speaker 1>maybe if I buy the book I'll figure it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

66
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:21.901
<v Speaker 1>I'll understand the puzzles deep inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was being goofy.</v>

67
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 1>When you write a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to think,</v>

68
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.913
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone could be reading this 30 years </v>

69
00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:30.280
<v Speaker 1>from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 years from now,</v>

70
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.990
<v Speaker 1>that is as Comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you write something in the morning,</v>

71
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.350
<v Speaker 1>you bring it on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tell you if it's funny or not.</v>

72
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.660
<v Speaker 1>You know what you're working with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go back and forth.</v>

73
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.920
<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's permanent and no one gets to review</v>

74
00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:45.754
<v Speaker 1>it until it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the nerve wracking part of it was </v>

75
00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:50.441
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

76
00:03:50.441 --> 00:03:51.860
<v Speaker 1>it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty proud of it.</v>

77
00:03:51.861 --> 00:03:54.670
<v Speaker 1>I like edited it like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've worked on it for a long time.</v>

78
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.740
<v Speaker 1>Will people think it's okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will they not think it's hackable?</v>

79
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.780
<v Speaker 1>They think it's good with is the writing</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

80
00:04:01.781 --> 00:04:05.420
<v Speaker 1>All that other stuff and it's been out </v>
<v Speaker 1>now for a week and uh,</v>

81
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.020
<v Speaker 1>the review,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell the reviews are good.</v>

82
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.943
<v Speaker 1>Like the people are reviewing it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing about it and calling and just </v>

83
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.790
<v Speaker 1>people just randomly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

84
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:15.693
<v Speaker 1>I'm over the hurdle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The anxiety of is this a good book is </v>

85
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.130
<v Speaker 1>over?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

86
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.453
<v Speaker 1>People like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny and it's people are saying I </v>

87
00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:24.874
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

88
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.500
<v Speaker 1>so that is huge.</v>

89
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.680
<v Speaker 1>It's just calm me down completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

90
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.300
<v Speaker 1>like you said for 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

91
00:04:31.301 --> 00:04:35.890
<v Speaker 1>everybody's like takes a dump on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll have some that are really fucking</v>

92
00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:37.960
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean some comics,</v>

93
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.203
<v Speaker 1>someone should have just walked in while</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were running and grabbing them and </v>

94
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.450
<v Speaker 1>you're doing something terrible for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

95
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.270
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be around for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

96
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.820
<v Speaker 1>People are going to refer to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

97
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.793
<v Speaker 1>People in these like really self </v>
<v Speaker 1>righteous defensive modes and they're </v>

98
00:04:56.501 --> 00:04:58.660
<v Speaker 1>writing things down and maybe like five </v>
<v Speaker 1>years from now they'd be like,</v>

99
00:04:58.661 --> 00:05:00.550
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck was I thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

100
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.590
<v Speaker 1>they're in the middle of writing it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've read some,</v>

101
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.990
<v Speaker 1>some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Tab.</v>

103

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just horrible stuff.</v>

104
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:08.651
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

105
00:05:08.651 --> 00:05:09.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

106
00:05:09.581 --> 00:05:10.414
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

107
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm relieved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not excited.</v>

108
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm just relieved like Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

109
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.230
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was good.</v>

110
00:05:17.231 --> 00:05:17.890
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was good.</v>

111
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.780
<v Speaker 1>I hoped it was good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My editor said it's good.</v>

112
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.970
<v Speaker 1>People are saying that the laughing when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're reading it,</v>

113
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.310
<v Speaker 1>like editors who don't normally say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of stuff.</v>

114
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.000
<v Speaker 1>So writing a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing with writing stand up,</v>

115
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:30.290
<v Speaker 1>like how do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

116
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:31.690
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how'd you divide your time?</v>

117
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.840
<v Speaker 1>It was um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was tough.</v>

118
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.330
<v Speaker 1>You stand up whenever I'm working on </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else,</v>

119
00:05:37.331 --> 00:05:39.790
<v Speaker 1>stand up kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work on it at night,</v>

120
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the book was,</v>

121
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.910
<v Speaker 1>I got into this rhythm of going in every</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning,</v>

122
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.223
<v Speaker 1>get up at seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go in with my coffee and sit there and </v>

123
00:05:49.721 --> 00:05:50.554
<v Speaker 1>that was booked time until noon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would try and just just work on that </v>

124
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.500
<v Speaker 1>and make it a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that wasn't for two years.</v>

125
00:05:57.501 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 1>That was like the last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

126
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.340
<v Speaker 1>year to eight months kind of thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>before that.</v>

127
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:07.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a little looser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to get it done and stuff.</v>

128
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.610
<v Speaker 1>But that real discipline of like coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>in every morning,</v>

129
00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:13.340
<v Speaker 1>sitting down and seven days a week just </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing,</v>

130
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.100
<v Speaker 1>just write wherever I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever I was doing,</v>

131
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:19.490
<v Speaker 1>I had to make sure that I had that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm on a plane with him in a hotel,</v>

132
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.593
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just writing the thing all the </v>

133
00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:24.050
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just became.</v>

134
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.670
<v Speaker 1>Because he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

135
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.820
<v Speaker 1>the biggest challenge for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think a lot of writers is that you</v>

136
00:06:31.441 --> 00:06:33.550
<v Speaker 1>judge yourself as you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

137
00:06:33.551 --> 00:06:34.840
<v Speaker 1>is this good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it to.</v>

138
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.470
<v Speaker 1>But you have to just get it down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that it's bad.</v>

139
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.513
<v Speaker 1>Just just get it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to write this chapter on crazy </v>

140
00:06:41.531 --> 00:06:42.364
<v Speaker 1>ants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm just going to write it and spit </v>

141
00:06:44.291 --> 00:06:47.650
<v Speaker 1>it out and then I'm going to go to work </v>
<v Speaker 1>on it like a bit,</v>

142
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:48.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

143
00:06:48.401 --> 00:06:49.234
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like stand up and just go back and just </v>

144
00:06:50.651 --> 00:06:53.040
<v Speaker 1>start editing and peeling back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>peeling back,</v>

145
00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.360
<v Speaker 1>getting rid of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>using when you're doing this.</v>

146
00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.990
<v Speaker 1>I did it all on word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Microsoft word and</v>

147
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:00.503
<v Speaker 2>scrivener.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what scribner and scribner </v>

148
00:07:02.261 --> 00:07:06.220
<v Speaker 2>is really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did my last special on scrivener.</v>

149
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.220
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the first time I've used it for,</v>

150
00:07:09.221 --> 00:07:10.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for running standup.</v>

151
00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:15.300
<v Speaker 2>And what's good about it is on the left </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand side you have a,</v>

152
00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.090
<v Speaker 2>like all of your different subjects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

153
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.320
<v Speaker 2>And you click on each subject and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be a whole column.</v>

154
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:24.640
<v Speaker 2>So like I had the title strange times </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the left hand side,</v>

155
00:07:24.641 --> 00:07:25.474
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what it looks like when you're </v>

156
00:07:26.681 --> 00:07:28.840
<v Speaker 2>looking at the chalk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cork board,</v>

157
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.033
<v Speaker 2>the corkboard is one aspect of it where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have these little cards like index </v>

158
00:07:34.901 --> 00:07:37.870
<v Speaker 2>cards and you said these index cards up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

159
00:07:37.871 --> 00:07:38.704
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the different things on the index </v>

160
00:07:39.461 --> 00:07:40.294
<v Speaker 2>cards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can organize it outside of the </v>

161
00:07:42.521 --> 00:07:43.354
<v Speaker 2>index cards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's also on each index to index the </v>

162
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:48.703
<v Speaker 2>corkboard.</v>

163
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.100
<v Speaker 2>It corresponds to each individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>subject,</v>

164
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:54.550
<v Speaker 2>like say like say if I'm doing a bid on </v>
<v Speaker 2>desks,</v>

165
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:58.030
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have desks on the lefthand side and</v>

166
00:07:58.031 --> 00:08:00.370
<v Speaker 2>then I'll write out all the stuff on </v>
<v Speaker 2>desks,</v>

167
00:08:00.371 --> 00:08:03.220
<v Speaker 2>but there's also a corkboard tab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

168
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:04.183
<v Speaker 2>And then so I have all the different </v>
<v Speaker 2>things to make sure that I covered all </v>

169
00:08:05.981 --> 00:08:08.290
<v Speaker 2>the notes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good Dude.</v>

170
00:08:08.291 --> 00:08:09.460
<v Speaker 2>I like it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

171
00:08:09.461 --> 00:08:11.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I like in life,</v>

172
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.630
<v Speaker 2>this is not really showing why I like </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

173
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:15.503
<v Speaker 2>I like it is because you can have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can move all those little chapters </v>

174
00:08:17.801 --> 00:08:21.880
<v Speaker 2>around and move all the bits around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like for standup.</v>

175
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.980
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really good.</v>

176
00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:24.863
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

177
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:29.500
<v Speaker 1>The organizing it gets so in your head </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts bogging you down.</v>

178
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.990
<v Speaker 1>But the good thing about this was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was essays,</v>

179
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.510
<v Speaker 1>so each one's like four or five pages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

180
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.960
<v Speaker 1>So I would just be like literally just </v>
<v Speaker 1>open up the file and go dad's,</v>

181
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.340
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to work on this one,</v>

182
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:44.200
<v Speaker 1>Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no gifts for dad.</v>

183
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.840
<v Speaker 1>And then just boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just edit that,</v>

184
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.520
<v Speaker 1>put it away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to the next,</v>

185
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just I could just bounce it.</v>

186
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.170
<v Speaker 1>I didn't when I'm trying to say is I </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have to keep track like a novel.</v>

187
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.180
<v Speaker 1>It didn't have 300 pages of flow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

188
00:08:57.181 --> 00:09:01.920
<v Speaker 1>they were all just hits so it was kinda </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar to stand up that way.</v>

189
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I could just go to work on them.</v>

190
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.270
<v Speaker 1>But it's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

191
00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:07.903
<v Speaker 1>I really loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I've had friends that have written </v>

192
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:10.884
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Collin Quinn came and did a book </v>

193
00:09:12.691 --> 00:09:15.210
<v Speaker 1>event with me a couple of weeks ago and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

194
00:09:15.211 --> 00:09:15.970
<v Speaker 1>and he wrote a book.</v>

195
00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:17.220
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never do it again.</v>

196
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.750
<v Speaker 1>I just hated it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't stand it.</v>

197
00:09:18.751 --> 00:09:20.100
<v Speaker 1>I hate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's a prolific guy.</v>

198
00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:20.934
<v Speaker 1>He writes a lot for his one man show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's always right and showing US </v>

199
00:09:25.171 --> 00:09:26.130
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

200
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:26.993
<v Speaker 1>the guy writes a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the writing for the book drove him </v>

201
00:09:28.701 --> 00:09:31.680
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really loved it.</v>

202
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:32.573
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe that you could look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at a five page essay and find something </v>

203
00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:38.460
<v Speaker 1>wrong with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time you looked at it,</v>

204
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.100
<v Speaker 1>every time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why am I saying this?</v>

205
00:09:41.101 --> 00:09:43.120
<v Speaker 1>They know this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do I have to say he?</v>

206
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.140
<v Speaker 1>He sat down at the table and ate his </v>
<v Speaker 1>breakfast.</v>

207
00:09:46.141 --> 00:09:47.700
<v Speaker 1>He ate his breakfast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

208
00:09:47.701 --> 00:09:48.534
<v Speaker 1>like you could just peel stuff away all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time and get it as as a direct as </v>

209
00:09:53.431 --> 00:09:54.264
<v Speaker 1>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I started to really just love the </v>

210
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:57.623
<v Speaker 1>love that Jordan Peterson told me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote his first book and it took him </v>

211
00:10:00.451 --> 00:10:05.451
<v Speaker 1>15 years because he went over every </v>
<v Speaker 1>single line every single day,</v>

212
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.593
<v Speaker 1>like a critic trying to find fault in </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that he did until he felt </v>

213
00:10:10.501 --> 00:10:11.070
<v Speaker 1>like he got it done.</v>

214
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:11.903
<v Speaker 1>It was on a cold war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She really wanted to make sure that he </v>

215
00:10:14.851 --> 00:10:17.340
<v Speaker 1>had the subject matter completely locked</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

216
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's daunting.</v>

217
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.630
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people can fact check.</v>

218
00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.793
<v Speaker 1>People can fact check what happened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me and putting my sister in a garbage </v>

219
00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:28.290
<v Speaker 1>can in fourth grade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

220
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was family.</v>

221
00:10:29.371 --> 00:10:30.204
<v Speaker 1>It's all about family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all about like the joy of being </v>

222
00:10:32.371 --> 00:10:33.204
<v Speaker 1>with other people and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the aggravations and all that kind </v>

223
00:10:35.491 --> 00:10:36.540
<v Speaker 1>of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was just.</v>

224
00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.200
<v Speaker 1>And I write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

225
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of that in my act,</v>

226
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:44.260
<v Speaker 1>so it was definitely in my wheelhouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not reading,</v>

227
00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:45.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm not reading books about the Cold </v>
<v Speaker 1>War.</v>

228
00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:47.910
<v Speaker 1>You're going to write another one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am going to write another one.</v>

229
00:10:47.911 --> 00:10:49.140
<v Speaker 1>Have you started yet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

230
00:10:49.141 --> 00:10:51.510
<v Speaker 1>no I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is a,</v>

231
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:52.523
<v Speaker 1>I have a couple ideas and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the publisher wants me to write </v>

232
00:10:56.011 --> 00:10:58.040

<v Speaker 1>show rather than.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

352
00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:17.320
<v Speaker 3>I guess this is a good time to bring it </v>
<v Speaker 3>up as any.</v>

353
00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:18.101
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

354
00:16:18.101 --> 00:16:23.101

<v Speaker 3>last week and um,</v>

355
00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.380
<v Speaker 3>he was a friend of mine and it was real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was real hard.</v>

356
00:16:26.381 --> 00:16:27.430
<v Speaker 3>Friday was real hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

357
00:16:27.431 --> 00:16:31.900
<v Speaker 3>woke up and I got a text from my friend </v>
<v Speaker 3>Maynard from tool.</v>

358
00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:38.580
<v Speaker 3>Maynard said so much for the Keenan </v>
<v Speaker 3>versus bordain celebrity Jujitsu match.</v>

359
00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.220

361
00:16:43.571 --> 00:16:47.200
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then I googled it and I saw it.</v>

362
00:16:47.201 --> 00:16:49.450
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit man,</v>

<v Speaker 3>in him?</v>

370
00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:09.340
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what was really weird,</v>

371
00:17:09.341 --> 00:17:13.890
<v Speaker 3>it was like he'd been saying really </v>
<v Speaker 3>recently that he'd never been happier.</v>

372
00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.720
<v Speaker 3>He was talking about his girlfriend and </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying that it never been happier.</v>

373
00:17:18.721 --> 00:17:21.750
<v Speaker 3>Didn't know it could be that happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't know someone could make them that</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

380
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:34.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean sometimes people when they say,</v>

385
00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.050

<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he was,</v>

386
00:17:43.051 --> 00:17:45.120
<v Speaker 3>but some people get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get up and down.</v>

387
00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:46.373
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

388
00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.500
<v Speaker 3>he liked to get fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

389
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.920
<v Speaker 3>he liked to drink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

390
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:53.270
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he enjoyed it.</v>

391
00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.010
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was something that he enjoyed.</v>

392
00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.510
<v Speaker 3>But we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

393
00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:58.643
<v Speaker 3>we did an episode of this show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went hunting for pheasants in </v>

394
00:18:02.911 --> 00:18:06.000
<v Speaker 3>Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We cooked over this campfire.</v>

395
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:11.210
<v Speaker 3>He cooked tastic and really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then afterwards we drank whiskey and</v>

396
00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:17.140
<v Speaker 3>a smoke weed and he goes deep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

397
00:18:17.141 --> 00:18:19.870
<v Speaker 3>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really where I'm sitting down,</v>

398
00:18:19.871 --> 00:18:20.704
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to just try to catch myself </v>

399
00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:23.290
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The world spinning,</v>

400
00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:25.660
<v Speaker 3>deep breath,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deep breath.</v>

401
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:28.570
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where's the fucking weed?</v>

402
00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.670
<v Speaker 3>They just kept going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just kept going.</v>

403
00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:36.320
<v Speaker 4>But I knew he drank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know he smoked weed.</v>

404
00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:37.293
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

405
00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:38.090
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

406
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:42.570
<v Speaker 3>he had a heroin problem when he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>younger and he kicked it,</v>

407
00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.690
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't feel the need to just be </v>
<v Speaker 3>sober.</v>

408
00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was kind of interesting about him.</v>

409
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:49.463
<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a thing you would get sober from </v>

410
00:18:52.471 --> 00:18:53.304
<v Speaker 3>a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They feel like they have to get sober </v>

411
00:18:54.781 --> 00:18:55.950
<v Speaker 3>from everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

412
00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.870
<v Speaker 3>That did not feel like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he,</v>

413
00:18:57.871 --> 00:19:01.410
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he would drink,</v>

414
00:19:01.411 --> 00:19:05.160
<v Speaker 3>but when he was home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like with his kid and he's homeless man,</v>

415
00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.170
<v Speaker 3>he didn't drink at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he would only that,</v>

416
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.150
<v Speaker 3>he would only do that when he would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the road.</v>

417
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:10.023
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He'd be stretches of time and he </v>

418
00:19:12.481 --> 00:19:15.690
<v Speaker 3>didn't drink at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was addicted to Jujitsu.</v>

419
00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.170
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was.</v>

420
00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:17.911
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

421
00:19:17.911 --> 00:19:21.750
<v Speaker 3>He was doing Jujitsu like literally </v>
<v Speaker 3>every day when I was hanging around with</v>

422
00:19:21.751 --> 00:19:23.420
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was um,</v>

423
00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:25.560
<v Speaker 3>he went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were in Montana.</v>

424
00:19:25.561 --> 00:19:26.394
<v Speaker 3>He went to Bozeman to find a local </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu club and trained with them in </v>

425
00:19:30.511 --> 00:19:32.770
<v Speaker 3>the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She just trained with everybody.</v>

426
00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:34.830
<v Speaker 3>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hardly ever did that on the road.</v>

427
00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.060
<v Speaker 3>Find a place I would just go to the gym </v>
<v Speaker 3>and workout wouldn't.</v>

428
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:43.280
<v Speaker 3>But he was so into learning and getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>better at Jujitsu.</v>

429
00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.980
<v Speaker 4>Do you know if he was on prescription </v>
<v Speaker 4>for depression or anything like that?</v>

430
00:19:48.981 --> 00:19:51.080
<v Speaker 4>I do not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm so suspicious of.</v>

431
00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:53.900
<v Speaker 4>Like when you heard of like Robin </v>
<v Speaker 4>Williams and Chris Cornell?</v>

432
00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:54.793
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's like he was on anti anxiety </v>

433
00:19:56.151 --> 00:19:57.800
<v Speaker 4>medication,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anti anxiety medications,</v>

434
00:19:57.801 --> 00:19:59.950
<v Speaker 4>a big one that stuff like it even,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

435
00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:01.320
<v Speaker 4>in their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

436
00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:02.653
<v Speaker 4>in their long list of side effects.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's always suicidal thoughts and then </v>

437
00:20:06.041 --> 00:20:08.180
<v Speaker 4>if you mix it with other things like </v>
<v Speaker 4>alcohol and this,</v>

438
00:20:08.181 --> 00:20:09.014
<v Speaker 4>and I don't know at all who was on what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it seems what bothers me is that </v>

439
00:20:12.531 --> 00:20:13.364
<v Speaker 4>it's not part of the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well Robin is a different take because </v>

440
00:20:16.821 --> 00:20:19.890
<v Speaker 4>robin had lewy body disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

441
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:24.200
<v Speaker 4>he had a heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had significant issues with that.</v>

442
00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:25.083
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my friend Dr Mark Gordon actually wrote </v>

443
00:20:27.261 --> 00:20:32.140
<v Speaker 4>a paper about long term Cesia</v>

444
00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:33.653
<v Speaker 3>like when you're under the longterm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like long duration for things like </v>

445
00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.280
<v Speaker 3>open heart surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

446
00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:40.323
<v Speaker 3>That there's a high instance of </v>
<v Speaker 3>depression afterwards and a lot of </v>

447
00:20:45.821 --> 00:20:48.280
<v Speaker 3>people coming of these</v>

448
00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:49.293
<v Speaker 5>big time operations where you get </v>
<v Speaker 5>anesthesia for long periods of time and </v>

449
00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:55.690
<v Speaker 5>have significant dips in their hormone </v>
<v Speaker 5>levels afterwards.</v>

450
00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:57.431
<v Speaker 5>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

451
00:20:57.431 --> 00:21:02.431
<v Speaker 5>it's not like a free ride getting put </v>
<v Speaker 5>under and having your heart opened up.</v>

452
00:21:02.651 --> 00:21:05.290
<v Speaker 5>And I mean your body goes through </v>
<v Speaker 5>massive trauma.</v>

453
00:21:05.291 --> 00:21:06.460
<v Speaker 5>Your body body's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit,</v>

454
00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.353
<v Speaker 5>we just had our chest plate split open </v>
<v Speaker 5>and your heart gets worked on or inside </v>

455
00:21:12.551 --> 00:21:13.510
<v Speaker 5>of us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

456
00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:14.673
<v Speaker 5>And there's a significant correlation in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mark Gordon's opinion between </v>

457
00:21:21.671 --> 00:21:24.050
<v Speaker 5>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 5>postsurgery,</v>

458
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:25.223
<v Speaker 5>postsurgery depression,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think it's something that people </v>

459
00:21:27.011 --> 00:21:29.180
<v Speaker 5>need to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had that obviously because he,</v>

460
00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:32.800
<v Speaker 5>he did have heart surgery for a long </v>
<v Speaker 5>period of time.</v>

461
00:21:32.801 --> 00:21:33.634
<v Speaker 5>The depression.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lucky enough to that because I know </v>

462
00:21:35.111 --> 00:21:35.944
<v Speaker 5>people get.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always thought it was just a mental </v>

463
00:21:37.061 --> 00:21:38.020
<v Speaker 5>thing of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

464
00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:42.340
<v Speaker 5>surviving something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I remember letterman on a show like</v>

465
00:21:42.341 --> 00:21:44.830
<v Speaker 5>weeping and like bringing in his staff </v>
<v Speaker 5>on and stuff.</v>

466
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:46.310
<v Speaker 5>I always,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know it was a hormone thing.</v>

467
00:21:46.311 --> 00:21:50.800
<v Speaker 5>I was thought it was just the trauma of </v>
<v Speaker 5>surviving that I think it can be both.</v>

468
00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:52.090
<v Speaker 5>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure.</v>

469
00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.840
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'm obviously no doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he was,</v>

470
00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:01.180
<v Speaker 5>I'd say you're closer to a garbage man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he was uh,</v>

471
00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:05.560
<v Speaker 5>explaining it to me the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that there is an issue with this.</v>

472
00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:11.370
<v Speaker 5>And so robin had that and he had some </v>
<v Speaker 5>serious neurological disorders and um,</v>

473
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.850
<v Speaker 5>and there was quite a few other things </v>
<v Speaker 5>too,</v>

474
00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:17.740
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're also complicated.</v>

475
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:20.460
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then whatever medications,</v>

476
00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:21.550
<v Speaker 5>this is the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

477
00:22:21.551 --> 00:22:23.290
<v Speaker 5>Like what are these medical,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's on,</v>

478
00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.120
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't really don't know,</v>

479
00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:26.403
<v Speaker 5>but I'm chester from Lincoln Park.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was on a shitload of things and he </v>

480
00:22:31.001 --> 00:22:34.290
<v Speaker 5>was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he was very troubled me.</v>

481
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:36.650
<v Speaker 5>He was a guy that was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he had some real problem,</v>

482
00:22:36.651 --> 00:22:38.140
<v Speaker 5>but he was also very medicated.</v>

483
00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:39.101
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

484
00:22:39.101 --> 00:22:44.101
<v Speaker 5>we have the highest suicide rate among </v>
<v Speaker 5>middle aged people in America than ever,</v>

485
00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:45.083
<v Speaker 5>like the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The numbers are through the roof and </v>

486
00:22:47.021 --> 00:22:51.580
<v Speaker 5>there's also this pharmaceutical opioid </v>
<v Speaker 5>crisis at the same time.</v>

487
00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.980
<v Speaker 5>And I just feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

488
00:22:53.981 --> 00:22:58.981
<v Speaker 5>people are on this shit that's really </v>
<v Speaker 5>affects your head and your mood.</v>

489
00:22:59.531 --> 00:23:00.364
<v Speaker 5>And it says right in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I remember I had a friend whose </v>

490
00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:04.893
<v Speaker 5>brother was a depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this was the eighties when we were </v>

491
00:23:07.301 --> 00:23:08.134
<v Speaker 5>kids and the the game,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lack of a better word of trying to get </v>

492
00:23:13.571 --> 00:23:15.490
<v Speaker 5>the right medicine for him because when </v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

493
00:23:15.491 --> 00:23:19.660
<v Speaker 5>when they prescribe the wrong one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>things got out of hand.</v>

494
00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.060
<v Speaker 5>I mean like really dangerously out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>hand,</v>

495
00:23:22.061 --> 00:23:22.894
<v Speaker 5>and then they finally find the right med</v>
<v Speaker 5>for him and then he kind of groomed </v>

496
00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:26.260
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

497
00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:31.260
<v Speaker 5>there's no obvious path.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is it's like say if you have</v>

498
00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:37.030
<v Speaker 5>some particular type of infection,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they give you antibiotics.</v>

499
00:23:37.031 --> 00:23:40.030
<v Speaker 5>If you have poison ivy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

500
00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:40.913
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they know what kind of cortisone cream </v>

501
00:23:42.401 --> 00:23:44.830
<v Speaker 5>to put on your what have you when you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>depressed.</v>

502
00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's</v>

503
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:48.560
<v Speaker 2>so many different factors involved in </v>
<v Speaker 2>depression.</v>

504
00:23:48.561 --> 00:23:49.394
<v Speaker 2>There's your actual life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right there is what's going on in your </v>

505
00:23:52.521 --> 00:23:56.600
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like are you taking care of your body?</v>

506
00:23:56.601 --> 00:23:57.434
<v Speaker 2>Are you exercising?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have loving relationships with </v>

507
00:23:59.961 --> 00:24:03.950
<v Speaker 2>your family and close friends or do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel distant and detached,</v>

508
00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:04.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

509
00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:05.723
<v Speaker 2>do you not have anyone in your life like</v>
<v Speaker 2>romantically do you not have a job that </v>

510
00:24:09.411 --> 00:24:11.600
<v Speaker 2>you enjoy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All those things factor into the way you</v>

511
00:24:11.601 --> 00:24:13.520
<v Speaker 2>feel about life and from the time you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were a kid.</v>

512
00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:15.140
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jared whole life,</v>

513
00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.153
<v Speaker 2>your whole life and then on top of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have like legitimate mental illness </v>

514
00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:21.083
<v Speaker 2>and then you have depression because </v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain is not producing enough </v>

515
00:24:23.571 --> 00:24:24.404
<v Speaker 2>serotonin or dopamine and there's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>many factors and people try to self </v>

516
00:24:28.161 --> 00:24:28.994
<v Speaker 2>medicate and I know a lot of people try </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it with extra exercise apparently </v>

517
00:24:34.101 --> 00:24:34.934
<v Speaker 2>seems to be as effective or more </v>
<v Speaker 2>effective than most ssri </v>

518
00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:40.310
<v Speaker 2>antidepressants.</v>

519
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:42.530
<v Speaker 1>I heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I'm right,</v>

520
00:24:42.531 --> 00:24:47.060
<v Speaker 1>but I remember hearing that whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>your body manufacturers or secretes when</v>

521
00:24:47.061 --> 00:24:50.840
<v Speaker 1>you exercise is similar to what a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these drugs</v>

522
00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:52.321
<v Speaker 2>having them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

523
00:24:52.321 --> 00:24:53.730
<v Speaker 2>you definitely get runner's high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

524
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:54.350
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

525
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:55.730
<v Speaker 2>There's high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You actually,</v>

526
00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:58.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your runner's high.</v>

527
00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:02.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the exact mechanisms </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved,</v>

528
00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.640
<v Speaker 2>but it has something to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cannabinoid receptors,</v>

529
00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:05.533
<v Speaker 2>so it literally gives you a high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's similar to almost like a </v>

530
00:25:08.631 --> 00:25:09.500
<v Speaker 2>marijuana hot,</v>

531
00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.280
<v Speaker 1>right know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

532
00:25:11.281 --> 00:25:12.990
<v Speaker 1>You get your euphoric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

533
00:25:12.991 --> 00:25:14.580
<v Speaker 1>You get like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

534
00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:15.443
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love running and just feel even when </v>

535
00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:19.370
<v Speaker 1>even if it's not identified for me as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>high,</v>

536
00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:21.240
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like smoking weed,</v>

537
00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:25.020
<v Speaker 1>my whole rest of my day is better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there is.</v>

538
00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.330
<v Speaker 1>There's a happy little thing going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

539
00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:28.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not flying,</v>

540
00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:33.240
<v Speaker 1>but I'm definitely not balled up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxious the way I was before the run.</v>

541
00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:34.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that ball up an anxious thing.</v>

542
00:25:34.711 --> 00:25:35.544
<v Speaker 2>I have my own theory about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the human body has physical </v>

543
00:25:38.101 --> 00:25:41.610
<v Speaker 2>requirements and I think if you don't be</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because of the design of it,</v>

544
00:25:41.611 --> 00:25:42.444
<v Speaker 2>the fact that human beings have lived </v>
<v Speaker 2>for thousands and thousands of years </v>

545
00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:46.523
<v Speaker 2>either hunting or gathering or running </v>
<v Speaker 2>away from danger or your body's like </v>

546
00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:51.713
<v Speaker 2>constantly inaction back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We essentially have the same bodies as </v>

547
00:25:55.801 --> 00:25:57.450
<v Speaker 2>people that live 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

548
00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:58.703
<v Speaker 2>Our DNA is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very similar and I think we have all </v>

549
00:26:01.111 --> 00:26:01.944
<v Speaker 2>these requirements that we don't meet </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and there's so many people that </v>

550
00:26:03.541 --> 00:26:05.700
<v Speaker 2>just sit down all day and that's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>

551
00:26:05.701 --> 00:26:06.534
<v Speaker 2>They walk to sit down and they sit down </v>
<v Speaker 2>again and most of their time of sitting </v>

552
00:26:09.601 --> 00:26:10.434
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether they're watching television or </v>

553
00:26:11.341 --> 00:26:16.020
<v Speaker 2>sitting in front of their computer and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit is terrible for you.</v>

554
00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

555
00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:18.550
<v Speaker 1>And you feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just feel shitty.</v>

556
00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:20.770
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel bad.</v>

557
00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:25.510
<v Speaker 1>I was in after the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the Bordain News,</v>

558
00:26:25.511 --> 00:26:30.511
<v Speaker 1>I was traveling outside of Chicago and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it just kind of clicked in my head like,</v>

559
00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:31.773
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just thinking whenever you have </v>

560
00:26:32.621 --> 00:26:36.890
<v Speaker 1>someone that inspires you and especially</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your friends like you were,</v>

561
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:38.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

562
00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:39.133
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't get it out of your head kind </v>

563
00:26:40.301 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 1>of a thing and you're balled up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anxiety is even worse.</v>

564
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.070
<v Speaker 1>And I just instinct instinctually got </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

565
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.233
<v Speaker 1>put on my running shoes and just went </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a run because I didn't want to sit </v>

566
00:26:51.871 --> 00:26:55.800
<v Speaker 1>and think about all of it so much and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>just felt better like I was.</v>

567
00:26:55.950 --> 00:27:00.750
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't euphoric again after the run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was definitely better than before.</v>

568
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:02.543
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're traveling and </v>

569
00:27:04.231 --> 00:27:06.960
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he did Jujitsu all the time.</v>

570
00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Cds or puzzles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are puzzles we can't solve.</v>

571
00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:11.493
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

572
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:14.320
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what was going on.</v>

573
00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:14.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

574
00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:17.820
<v Speaker 3>and there's no way to ask him obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

575
00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:19.690
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I,</v>

576
00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:22.750
<v Speaker 3>when I traveled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the first things I do,</v>

577
00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:24.940
<v Speaker 3>whether I'm coming home or going there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's workout.</v>

578
00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:28.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't this weekend because Friday</v>

579
00:27:28.001 --> 00:27:33.001
<v Speaker 3>when I got there I worked out Thursday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'd worked out that day already.</v>

580
00:27:33.191 --> 00:27:36.100
<v Speaker 3>I ran that day and then I got there </v>
<v Speaker 3>Thursday night,</v>

581
00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:38.800
<v Speaker 3>woke up Friday to that text and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>

582
00:27:38.801 --> 00:27:41.290
<v Speaker 3>fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to do anything.</v>

583
00:27:41.291 --> 00:27:42.780
<v Speaker 3>I cried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

584
00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:44.123
<v Speaker 3>I felt like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got a bunch of phone calls from some </v>

585
00:27:46.031 --> 00:27:48.700
<v Speaker 3>friends and then I had two shows that </v>
<v Speaker 3>night and I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I just got a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just got to get on the horse her up.</v>

587
00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:53.103
<v Speaker 3>And it was a little worried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a little worried that I was going </v>

588
00:27:54.401 --> 00:27:56.830
<v Speaker 3>to be like moody or weirded out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

589
00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:57.843
<v Speaker 3>But once I got there I was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The emails with the San Tino and Tony </v>

590
00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:02.620
<v Speaker 3>Hinchcliffe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>

591
00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.560
<v Speaker 3>So those two guys are great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just had a fun time.</v>

592
00:28:05.561 --> 00:28:09.230
<v Speaker 3>We talked a little bit about it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>smoked a little weed.</v>

593
00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.240
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got Up there and just had some fun</v>

594
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:12.143
<v Speaker 1>and the energy of the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw your instagram of the crowd and </v>

595
00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:15.970
<v Speaker 1>this beautiful theater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an amazing theater.</v>

596
00:28:15.971 --> 00:28:16.804
<v Speaker 1>You can't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be tough to be depressed and do it </v>

597
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.350
<v Speaker 1>with all those fans in that 100 people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

598
00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did two shows.</v>

599
00:28:24.071 --> 00:28:24.970
<v Speaker 1>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were both great.</v>

600
00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they looked killer font.</v>

601
00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:29.500
<v Speaker 1>Awesome town man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great food people.</v>

602
00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:32.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a combination of in the big city </v>
<v Speaker 1>and like Midwest,</v>

603
00:28:32.951 --> 00:28:34.300
<v Speaker 1>like friendly people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

604
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:35.143
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the summer becomes a totally </v>

605
00:28:36.791 --> 00:28:38.510
<v Speaker 1>different city too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was old.</v>

606
00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:39.423
<v Speaker 1>I'd always gone my whole career in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>winter and then literally just like </v>

607
00:28:42.341 --> 00:28:44.350
<v Speaker 1>three years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went in the summer and I was like,</v>

608
00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:47.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this place is amazing.</v>

609
00:28:47.291 --> 00:28:49.320
<v Speaker 1>The parks and the festivals and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

610
00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.380
<v Speaker 1>Even in the winter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the winter's gigs there</v>

611
00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:54.310
<v Speaker 3>in December and January I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

612
00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:56.620
<v Speaker 3>it's like they're happy to be inside.</v>

613
00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:58.893
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that you came through the cold to </v>

614
00:29:01.301 --> 00:29:02.134
<v Speaker 1>see them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

615
00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:03.633
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

616
00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:06.650
<v Speaker 1>but back to the food thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

617
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean the stories that Bordain told </v>
<v Speaker 1>through food,</v>

618
00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:12.550
<v Speaker 1>whereas just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

619
00:29:12.551 --> 00:29:14.770
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why he reached so many people.</v>

620
00:29:14.771 --> 00:29:15.604
<v Speaker 1>You could sit with that show and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>really took his time and you've really </v>

621
00:29:19.361 --> 00:29:21.850
<v Speaker 1>felt like you were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had been there.</v>

622
00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:24.670
<v Speaker 1>Well after he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after he left us an episode.</v>

623
00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:28.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He made me think of food as an art form.</v>

624
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:30.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never thought of as an art form before</v>

625
00:29:30.411 --> 00:29:33.410
<v Speaker 3>watching no reservations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his original show.</v>

626
00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:39.280
<v Speaker 3>I've watched that show and I just </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't feel like,</v>

627
00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.590
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not what thought it was.</v>

628
00:29:41.591 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was</v>

629
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:42.491
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

630
00:29:42.491 --> 00:29:44.770
<v Speaker 2>this guy knows how to cook yummy food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

631
00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:47.890
<v Speaker 2>But then then watching his show I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

632
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:49.090
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is art.</v>

633
00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:49.983
<v Speaker 2>Like these guys are treating this like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>painting or sculpture or something like </v>

634
00:29:52.961 --> 00:29:53.794
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they're passionate and they're </v>

635
00:29:55.751 --> 00:29:59.170
<v Speaker 2>all tattooed up and Weirdos that they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>artists.</v>

636
00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:01.550
<v Speaker 2>They're just artists that cook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

637
00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:06.160
<v Speaker 2>It might as well be making music or </v>
<v Speaker 2>painting,</v>

638
00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:08.560
<v Speaker 2>whatever it would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drawing their artists</v>

639
00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.960
<v Speaker 1>at its best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

640
00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:11.630
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the same thing with like within any,</v>

641
00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:12.563
<v Speaker 1>any other art form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's people that just crank it </v>

642
00:30:14.401 --> 00:30:17.220
<v Speaker 1>out and see a way to make money and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can tell there's a difference,</v>

643
00:30:17.221 --> 00:30:22.221
<v Speaker 1>but once you stuff from an artist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're spoiled because then you're like,</v>

644
00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:24.660
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people don't care as much.</v>

645
00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.410
<v Speaker 1>This is technically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is Lasagna,</v>

646
00:30:28.411 --> 00:30:31.260
<v Speaker 1>but ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>

647
00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:32.680
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating.</v>

648
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:33.240
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

649
00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.710
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The approach is very,</v>

650
00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:37.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very contagious.</v>

651
00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:38.763
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You watched the way they cook and you </v>

652
00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:43.030
<v Speaker 2>watch like their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their passion for the food.</v>

653
00:30:43.031 --> 00:30:46.060
<v Speaker 2>It makes you hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to eat and you also want to try</v>

654
00:30:46.061 --> 00:30:46.601
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

655
00:30:46.601 --> 00:30:47.330
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

656
00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:48.150
<v Speaker 2>I always want to try it.</v>

657
00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:49.530
<v Speaker 1>Always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always.</v>

658
00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:51.170
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

659
00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:52.763
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going around and meeting all of these </v>

660
00:30:55.531 --> 00:30:56.364
<v Speaker 1>bakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they all got into it because </v>

661
00:30:58.111 --> 00:31:00.990
<v Speaker 1>there's a love there and then it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really hard work.</v>

662
00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:02.730
<v Speaker 1>Like these people work there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

663
00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:03.780
<v Speaker 1>2:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning,</v>

664
00:31:03.781 --> 00:31:05.670
<v Speaker 1>they're baking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like in there,</v>

665
00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:08.580
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it sounds so silly,</v>

666
00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:09.653
<v Speaker 1>but anytime I'd walk into a coffee shop </v>
<v Speaker 1>or a bakery or something and just see </v>

667
00:31:12.721 --> 00:31:13.554
<v Speaker 1>that whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a whole display case filled with </v>

668
00:31:14.941 --> 00:31:19.650
<v Speaker 1>stuff seems like it's always been there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't now meeting the people,</v>

669
00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:23.040
<v Speaker 1>these poor bastards who are making it </v>
<v Speaker 1>every day at 2:00</v>

670
00:31:23.041 --> 00:31:24.870
<v Speaker 1>in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard,</v>

671
00:31:24.871 --> 00:31:25.704
<v Speaker 1>hard work and the only way it seems that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can continue to do it is because </v>

672
00:31:29.851 --> 00:31:33.810
<v Speaker 1>there was that initial love of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The deep,</v>

673
00:31:33.811 --> 00:31:34.644
<v Speaker 1>deep love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They learned it from their grandparents </v>

674
00:31:35.911 --> 00:31:36.744
<v Speaker 1>or they just went to school and figured </v>
<v Speaker 1>it out and they just hooked them and </v>

675
00:31:40.231 --> 00:31:41.064
<v Speaker 1>that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's enough of a big bang explosion of </v>

676
00:31:43.541 --> 00:31:48.100
<v Speaker 1>love that they stay in it for like 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and make a business out of it.</v>

677
00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:52.100
<v Speaker 2>My grandfather used to walk to get bread</v>
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>

678
00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:53.460
<v Speaker 2>We would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

679
00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:56.750
<v Speaker 2>he lived on North Ninth Street in North </v>
<v Speaker 2>New Jersey.</v>

680
00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:57.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

681
00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:00.620
<v Speaker 2>which was at one point in time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Italian community,</v>

682
00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:02.930
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't when he lived there,</v>

683
00:32:02.931 --> 00:32:03.780
<v Speaker 2>when he died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

684
00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:07.390
<v Speaker 2>but when I was a boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would go,</v>

685
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:09.460
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would leave his house,</v>

686
00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:11.050
<v Speaker 2>wound visit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay there,</v>

687
00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:14.650
<v Speaker 2>we'd leave his house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd walk like three or four blocks down</v>

688
00:32:14.651 --> 00:32:18.820
<v Speaker 2>the street to this bakery that he had </v>
<v Speaker 2>been going to for probably 30 years.</v>

689
00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:23.410
<v Speaker 2>And these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was like an old town in bakery.</v>

690
00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:28.630
<v Speaker 2>Those white paper bags put the loaves in</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you go there.</v>

691
00:32:28.901 --> 00:32:31.610
<v Speaker 2>They would go there every day and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>Italian bread every day,</v>

692
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:33.520
<v Speaker 2>every day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get fresh bread.</v>

693
00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:37.210
<v Speaker 2>And the bread was good for about a day </v>
<v Speaker 2>or two.</v>

694
00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 2>Like if you got the second day I was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little dry and</v>

695
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:41.083
<v Speaker 5>stale,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you got it that day boy sliced </v>

696

00:34:11.301 --> 00:34:12.770
<v Speaker 5>I'd have to hide.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would start yelling.</v>

732
00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:17.960
<v Speaker 5>My grandmother was late for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything she ever did,</v>

00:34:17.961 --> 00:34:20.360
<v Speaker 5>she was laid for and my grandfather's </v>
<v Speaker 5>name,</v>

734
00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:23.000
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my family was very unoriginal.</v>

735
00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:28.240
<v Speaker 5>My father's name was Joseph.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My grandfather's name is Joseph.</v>

736
00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:33.110
<v Speaker 5>My Grandmother's name is Joseph.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My name is Joseph,</v>

737
00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:37.430
<v Speaker 5>so it's like a lot of fucking jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you call your grandmother grandma,</v>

738
00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:38.690
<v Speaker 5>grandma,</v>
<v Speaker 5>grandma.</v>

739
00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:39.703
<v Speaker 5>But when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

740
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:40.543
<v Speaker 5>when I was over there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember my grandmother was always </v>

741
00:34:42.441 --> 00:34:44.390
<v Speaker 5>yelling at my grandfather's whether we </v>
<v Speaker 5>got to leave,</v>

742
00:34:44.391 --> 00:34:49.391
<v Speaker 5>we got to leave and she would get crazy.</v>

743
00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:50.773
<v Speaker 5>It would fucking get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was always scared of marriage because </v>

744
00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:54.713
<v Speaker 5>it was part of the reason why I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>scared of my grandparents were always </v>

745
00:34:56.271 --> 00:34:59.780
<v Speaker 5>yelling at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was wanting to get the fuck away,</v>

746
00:34:59.781 --> 00:35:00.614
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was just how they communicated back </v>

747
00:35:02.271 --> 00:35:03.770
<v Speaker 5>then though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember my,</v>

748
00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:05.480
<v Speaker 5>my grandparents too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

749
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:06.343
<v Speaker 5>just shy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

750
00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:08.493
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

751
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:11.510
<v Speaker 5>like veins popping out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

752
00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:13.790
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they grew up in the hard times,</v>

753
00:35:13.791 --> 00:35:17.690
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when my grandmother had a stroke and um,</v>

754
00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:18.553
<v Speaker 5>when they were taking care of her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they started finding these little </v>

755
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:25.310
<v Speaker 5>pockets of money that she had squirreled</v>
<v Speaker 5>away in the house right over the house,</v>

756
00:35:25.311 --> 00:35:28.270
<v Speaker 5>like coffee cans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>passionate,</v>

757
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:30.830
<v Speaker 5>because during the depression,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

758
00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:32.480
<v Speaker 5>people just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

759
00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:34.370
<v Speaker 5>they realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

760
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:36.560
<v Speaker 5>it can get to a point where there's no </v>
<v Speaker 5>food,</v>

761
00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 5>like nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nothing</v>

762
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:41.940
<v Speaker 3>and people starved to death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really possible.</v>

763
00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:43.043
<v Speaker 3>It was the reality in the United States </v>
<v Speaker 3>going through that was far better than </v>

764
00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:51.880
<v Speaker 3>like say Europe post World War II or the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Soviet Union where you know,</v>

765
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:55.290
<v Speaker 3>it was worse there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck man.</v>

766
00:35:55.291 --> 00:35:57.300
<v Speaker 3>People Starve to death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>

767
00:35:57.301 --> 00:35:58.134
<v Speaker 3>Untold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many people starve to death in the </v>

768
00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:02.190
<v Speaker 3>Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 3>starve to death.</v>

769
00:36:02.191 --> 00:36:03.024
<v Speaker 3>I know that sounds selfish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I only thought of it in terms of </v>

770
00:36:04.771 --> 00:36:06.480
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course the whole time.</v>

771
00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:07.363
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

772
00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:08.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

773
00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:10.890
<v Speaker 3>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia took it really bad.</v>

774
00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:12.780
<v Speaker 3>Russia to World War Two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>

775
00:36:12.781 --> 00:36:13.614
<v Speaker 3>very bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these people that grew up during </v>

776
00:36:16.691 --> 00:36:19.270
<v Speaker 3>that era.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When my grandparents came here,</v>

777
00:36:19.271 --> 00:36:20.104
<v Speaker 3>my grandfather came here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think when he was seven and it was </v>

778
00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:25.780
<v Speaker 3>during the depression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was like the worst.</v>

779
00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:27.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the early thirties and you know,</v>

780
00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:30.280
<v Speaker 3>my grandmother was similar age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just had this,</v>

781
00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:33.580
<v Speaker 3>this mentality like it could all go </v>
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

782
00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:34.503
<v Speaker 3>They had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had seen it yet it was burned into </v>

783
00:36:36.491 --> 00:36:38.080
<v Speaker 3>them and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids today,</v>

784
00:36:38.081 --> 00:36:41.080
<v Speaker 3>everyone's like fucking leaving food on </v>
<v Speaker 3>their plate.</v>

785
00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:42.303
<v Speaker 3>No one's worrying about where it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming from and everybody thinks they </v>

786
00:36:45.251 --> 00:36:48.460
<v Speaker 3>had a totally different mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were scared big time.</v>

787
00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:48.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

788
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:49.783
<v Speaker 1>I mean they had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had nothing and they would save </v>

789
00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:52.880
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every little piece,</v>

790
00:36:52.881 --> 00:36:54.590
<v Speaker 1>every little something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

791
00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:58.460
<v Speaker 1>tin foil and think about how messed up </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that they go from that.</v>

792
00:36:58.730 --> 00:36:59.563
<v Speaker 1>They go from the depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get out of it and then you roll </v>

793
00:37:01.401 --> 00:37:04.010
<v Speaker 1>into World War II,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like these people,</v>

794
00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:05.293
<v Speaker 1>they dealt with a lot of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of stuff that we didn't have to </v>

795
00:37:09.171 --> 00:37:10.004
<v Speaker 1>deal with.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

905
00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:10.310
<v Speaker 5>having a war that affected people the </v>
<v Speaker 5>way World War Two did,</v>

906
00:42:10.311 --> 00:42:13.640
<v Speaker 5>where the entire need,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not just the entire nation was involved,</v>

907
00:42:13.641 --> 00:42:16.910
<v Speaker 5>but the whole world was involved in this</v>
<v Speaker 5>conflict to stop evil.</v>

912
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:29.703

<v Speaker 5>invading Europe and dropping bombs on </v>

913
00:42:34.191 --> 00:42:35.460

<v Speaker 5>eugenics and want to create an area in </v>

915

<v Speaker 5>where do you get all the fucking </v>

920
00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.780
<v Speaker 5>engineers in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

921
00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:58.070
<v Speaker 5>like automobiles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>top end,</v>

929
00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:21.770
<v Speaker 5>planes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they were super,</v>

930
00:43:21.771 --> 00:43:25.640
<v Speaker 5>super advanced or super advanced now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you have this real,</v>

931
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:28.400
<v Speaker 5>you have this real evil focus.</v>

932
00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.270
<v Speaker 5>Like it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

933
00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:31.850
<v Speaker 5>the world has got to come and go get </v>
<v Speaker 5>this one guy.</v>

934
00:43:31.851 --> 00:43:33.170
<v Speaker 5>It seemed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

935
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:36.500
<v Speaker 5>I mean I wasn't there but it seems more </v>
<v Speaker 5>black and white and the way the world is</v>

936
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:37.363
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there was a thing called </v>

937
00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:39.493
<v Speaker 5>operation paperclip that happened where </v>
<v Speaker 5>after the war we scooped up all these </v>

938
00:43:44.061 --> 00:43:48.460
<v Speaker 5>Nazi scientists secretly and some of </v>
<v Speaker 5>them were like legit,</v>

939
00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:51.530
<v Speaker 5>like Wernher von Braun,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the guy who was in charge of NASA,</v>

940
00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:55.220
<v Speaker 5>he was a Nazi rally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a hundred percent.</v>

941
00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:58.190
<v Speaker 5>The Simon Wiesenthal Center said that if</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was alive today,</v>

942
00:43:58.191 --> 00:43:59.024
<v Speaker 5>they would prosecute him for crimes </v>
<v Speaker 5>against humanity and he was the head of </v>

943
00:44:01.611 --> 00:44:04.220
<v Speaker 5>NASA who's the head of NASA.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She,</v>

944
00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:05.203
<v Speaker 5>they took monsters when they brought </v>
<v Speaker 5>those monsters over here and those </v>

945
00:44:08.421 --> 00:44:11.870
<v Speaker 5>monsters helped us make the Apollo </v>
<v Speaker 5>rockets.</v>

946
00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:12.780
<v Speaker 5>She.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

947
00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:15.350
<v Speaker 5>And then some of the monsters went to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Soviet Union.</v>

948
00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:18.010
<v Speaker 5>They took some of those monsters can </v>
<v Speaker 5>hills where I mean,</v>

949
00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:20.570
<v Speaker 5>and there's no reason to whitewash that </v>
<v Speaker 5>either.</v>

950
00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:21.403
<v Speaker 5>Those were real monsters were real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they hung the five slow as Jews </v>

951
00:44:24.051 --> 00:44:24.884
<v Speaker 5>everyday in front of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the rocket factory in Berlin where </v>

952
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:30.210
<v Speaker 5>Wernher von Braun was making rockets </v>
<v Speaker 5>for,</v>

953
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:31.980
<v Speaker 5>for the Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

954
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:32.873
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had these Jews that were slaves </v>

955
00:44:34.411 --> 00:44:35.280
<v Speaker 5>that worked as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

956
00:44:35.281 --> 00:44:36.114
<v Speaker 5>there's people that were alive today </v>
<v Speaker 5>that have those tattoos on their arms </v>

957
00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:40.523
<v Speaker 5>at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>talked about meeting him there and she </v>

958
00:44:42.130 --> 00:44:45.960
<v Speaker 5>hit me and they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would hang the slowest workers.</v>

959
00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:47.220
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

960
00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:50.130
<v Speaker 5>In the front of the factory and just </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting this keeps going to work.</v>

961
00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:54.300
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't leave the country.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What did you do?</v>

962
00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:58.370
<v Speaker 5>And then get out in Nazi Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yay.</v>

963
00:44:58.450 --> 00:45:00.150
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how the fuck could you get out?</v>

964
00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:01.830
<v Speaker 5>You were a slave.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

965
00:45:01.831 --> 00:45:03.370
<v Speaker 5>not the chooser.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Baron,</v>

966
00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:05.790
<v Speaker 5>the guys who were working on were </v>
<v Speaker 5>working for the,</v>

967
00:45:05.791 --> 00:45:06.950
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for the company.</v>

968
00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:09.420
<v Speaker 5>Like to see the people being hung and </v>
<v Speaker 5>still hang in there.</v>

969
00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:11.410
<v Speaker 5>They were Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

970
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:12.660
<v Speaker 5>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were all in.</v>

971
00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:13.613
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

972
00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:14.543
<v Speaker 5>whether or not he agreed with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ideology wholeheartedly mean I didn't </v>

973
00:45:17.821 --> 00:45:18.654
<v Speaker 5>have a conversation with them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if he was doing for </v>

974
00:45:20.011 --> 00:45:23.090
<v Speaker 5>pragmatic purposes because he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>frightened or whatever,</v>

975
00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:25.260
<v Speaker 5>but get a disguise,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get out of there.</v>

976
00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.410
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

977
00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:29.880
<v Speaker 5>one of those glasses with the mustaches </v>
<v Speaker 5>is that work?</v>

978
00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:35.040
<v Speaker 5>Go to the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He can come to you.</v>

979
00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:36.360
<v Speaker 5>Take it off like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

980
00:45:36.361 --> 00:45:37.740
<v Speaker 5>it's like a NASA guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

981
00:45:37.741 --> 00:45:40.200
<v Speaker 5>this is like a suburb.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a slow slide,</v>

982
00:45:40.201 --> 00:45:42.390
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure into that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the,</v>

983
00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:43.040
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

984
00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:43.873
<v Speaker 5>the slot wasn't that slow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But from World War One and world war </v>

985
00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:48.660
<v Speaker 5>two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as it escalated,</v>

986
00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:52.740
<v Speaker 5>I think it just got to this point where </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>

987
00:45:52.741 --> 00:45:54.120
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what are we doing?</v>

988
00:45:54.121 --> 00:45:54.954
<v Speaker 5>When they started having concentration </v>
<v Speaker 5>camps and killing all the Jews got </v>

989
00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:00.570
<v Speaker 5>terrifying and those.</v>

990
00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:03.240
<v Speaker 5>So he took a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those guys brought them over here.</v>

991
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:05.880
<v Speaker 5>They worked for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>worked for the US government man.</v>

992
00:46:05.881 --> 00:46:06.714
<v Speaker 5>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a [inaudible] 67 Volkswagen </v>

993
00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:11.400
<v Speaker 5>little beetle sweet little car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sweet little car.</v>

994
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:12.263
<v Speaker 5>It was a little 10 pounds now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's solid and yet you can't get </v>

995
00:46:17.011 --> 00:46:19.020
<v Speaker 5>around like every time we meant it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you think,</v>

996
00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:20.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this was the people's car.</v>

997
00:46:20.821 --> 00:46:24.320
<v Speaker 5>This was the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this was the early Nazi Germany.</v>

998
00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:25.660
<v Speaker 5>Hitler on the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

999
00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:27.480
<v Speaker 5>at the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at the plants,</v>

1000
00:46:27.481 --> 00:46:28.314
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>being very proud of at this car and </v>

1001
00:46:29.581 --> 00:46:30.060
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1002
00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:32.940
<v Speaker 5>here's a good way of looking at it too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have a 67,</v>

1003
00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:33.660
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1004
00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:35.790
<v Speaker 5>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I had a 19,</v>

1005
00:46:35.791 --> 00:46:40.791
<v Speaker 5>98 car that was produced by Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you mean in 98?</v>

1006
00:46:41.490 --> 00:46:46.490
<v Speaker 5>Because it's 20 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Twenty years from 67 to like literally.</v>

1007
00:46:48.271 --> 00:46:49.104
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1008
00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:51.120
<v Speaker 5>it's that era.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1009
00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:52.740
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's so close.</v>

1010
00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:54.420
<v Speaker 5>So close.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Twenty years.</v>

1011
00:46:54.421 --> 00:46:55.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's nothing.</v>

1012
00:46:55.590 --> 00:46:57.300
<v Speaker 5>That's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>God.</v>

1013
00:46:57.310 --> 00:47:00.600
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Think about it that way.</v>

1014
00:47:00.601 --> 00:47:01.434
<v Speaker 5>There is that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that car is 20 slash 20 years removed </v>

1015
00:47:04.351 --> 00:47:06.480
<v Speaker 5>from Hitler being empowered.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you literally.</v>

1016
00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:11.540
<v Speaker 5>Did you do that randomly?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Google that because that's my car.</v>

1017
00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:15.900
<v Speaker 5>My car is literally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as you're actually adding back color,</v>

1018
00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:17.670
<v Speaker 5>different wheels,</v>
<v Speaker 5>different hubcaps now,</v>

1019
00:47:17.671 --> 00:47:21.000
<v Speaker 5>but I mean the activity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My friend Jimmy Lawless had one of those</v>

1020
00:47:21.001 --> 00:47:24.330
<v Speaker 5>when were in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was so light.</v>

1021
00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:25.393
<v Speaker 5>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he had a tiny ass little engine in </v>

1022
00:47:27.901 --> 00:47:29.290
<v Speaker 5>the back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's got a little four cylinder.</v>

1023
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:31.930
<v Speaker 5>That's a big.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you see this little beetle,</v>

1024
00:47:31.931 --> 00:47:33.650
<v Speaker 5>you don't think Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you think,</v>

1025
00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:38.170
<v Speaker 5>think it's cute or adorable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen what they do?</v>

1026
00:47:38.171 --> 00:47:41.110
<v Speaker 5>They take an older nine slash 11 inch </v>
<v Speaker 5>and put them in these things.</v>

1027
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:44.530
<v Speaker 5>Make them fast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know they do that with the buses too,</v>

1028
00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:46.750
<v Speaker 5>but you look how little those fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>tires are.</v>

1029
00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:49.270
<v Speaker 5>I know that thing ain't got any </v>
<v Speaker 5>traction.</v>

1030
00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:51.490
<v Speaker 5>No going around turns with that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1031
00:47:51.491 --> 00:47:54.880
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were smart back then though.</v>

1032
00:47:55.110 --> 00:47:57.850
<v Speaker 5>Their engineering with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They put the weight of the engine in the</v>

1033
00:47:57.851 --> 00:47:58.780
<v Speaker 5>back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1034
00:47:58.781 --> 00:48:01.060
<v Speaker 5>and it has such a different effect </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

1035
00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:06.100
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of amazing to look at all </v>
<v Speaker 5>automobile manufacturing in the thirties</v>

1036
00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:08.740
<v Speaker 5>before the war come like there was </v>
<v Speaker 5>enough metal for everybody.</v>

1037
00:48:08.741 --> 00:48:11.520
<v Speaker 5>There was enough ingenuity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The French card,</v>

1038
00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:16.510
<v Speaker 5>all the design is so amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a real moment of,</v>

1039
00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:17.823
<v Speaker 5>of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>inspiration and creativity and then the </v>

1040
00:48:20.381 --> 00:48:21.214
<v Speaker 5>war came into this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like all the resources and all the </v>

1041
00:48:22.541 --> 00:48:25.180
<v Speaker 5>people and everything got dampened down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But man,</v>

1042
00:48:25.181 --> 00:48:26.014
<v Speaker 5>they were flying in the thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's interesting though is there was </v>

1043
00:48:28.751 --> 00:48:32.190
<v Speaker 5>another resurgence in the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1044
00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:33.033
<v Speaker 5>especially in America.</v>
<v Speaker 5>American cars in the sixties were </v>

1045
00:48:35.081 --> 00:48:39.160
<v Speaker 5>fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the gas crisis got them right.</v>

1046
00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:40.630
<v Speaker 5>The Seventies.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1051
00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:55.400

<v Speaker 5>sixties to somewhere around 71.</v>

1052
00:48:57.370 --> 00:48:58.203
<v Speaker 5>But the last of the great cars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like 71 Barracuda's still pretty bad </v>

<v Speaker 5>they were just lighter.</v>

1059
00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:19.933
<v Speaker 5>They try to make them more fuel </v>
<v Speaker 5>efficient and something happened to the </v>

<v Speaker 4>weren't thinking I had a Toyota Corolla </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a horn that play 200 songs.</v>

1120
00:52:24.681 --> 00:52:25.514
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm thinking about this now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how often people use cell phones and </v>

1121
00:52:30.081 --> 00:52:33.380
<v Speaker 4>such.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are people thinking back then?</v>

1122
00:52:33.381 --> 00:52:35.480
<v Speaker 4>Like why didn't they get CBS on their </v>
<v Speaker 4>car?</v>

1123
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:37.010
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a good question.</v>

1124
00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:39.110
<v Speaker 4>Why wouldn't everybody have one?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1125
00:52:39.111 --> 00:52:41.180
<v Speaker 4>And it especially then it was like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>big trucking era.</v>

1126
00:52:41.181 --> 00:52:45.040
<v Speaker 4>It was a convoy dude.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Smokey and the bandit had it come on.</v>

1128
00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:48.523

<v Speaker 4>Smokey and the bandit had it in his </v>

1129
00:52:49.791 --> 00:52:50.830
<v Speaker 4>trans am.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1130
00:52:50.831 --> 00:52:52.400
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were talking to each other.</v>

1131
00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:54.730
<v Speaker 4>What year was that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he was.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He had a [inaudible] 79 trans am.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1133
00:52:57.030 --> 00:53:01.520
<v Speaker 4>I was going to put it at seventy eight </v>
<v Speaker 4>cents at a CBS exploded in the seventies</v>

1134
00:53:01.521 --> 00:53:06.521
<v Speaker 4>when the oil crisis caused the miles per</v>
<v Speaker 4>hour on the highway to go down at 55 and</v>

1135
00:53:06.681 --> 00:53:09.890
<v Speaker 4>truckers started using them until each </v>
<v Speaker 4>other where the best gas prices were.</v>

1136
00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:15.050
<v Speaker 4>A network started with people using CBS </v>
<v Speaker 4>rubber duck.</v>

1137
00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:15.913
<v Speaker 4>That's funny because I would have </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought that they were excluded because </v>

1138
00:53:17.991 --> 00:53:20.270
<v Speaker 4>they were using them to tell each other </v>
<v Speaker 4>where the cops were.</v>

1139
00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:22.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

00:54:15.601 --> 00:54:17.160
<v Speaker 5>that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like San Francisco.</v>

1160
00:54:17.161 --> 00:54:19.860
<v Speaker 5>That was recently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They walk for approach protest.</v>

1161
00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:22.470
<v Speaker 5>They would walk out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just walk on the highway.</v>

1162
00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:25.560
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck was that about?</v>
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

<v Speaker 5>You want everyone to hate you?</v>

1164
00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:29.550
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not just that.</v>

1165
00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:32.790
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're stopping people from </v>
<v Speaker 5>being able to get to a hospital.</v>

1166
00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:36.180
<v Speaker 5>You might cause people loved ones' lives</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they did.</v>

1167
00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:38.010
<v Speaker 5>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what happened with the governor.</v>

<v Speaker 5>of that,</v>

1170
00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:43.920
<v Speaker 5>because they couldn't get to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>hospital.</v>

<v Speaker 5>They were.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He not in jail for that guys.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That is just fucking straight </v>

1174
00:54:54.991 --> 00:54:55.980
<v Speaker 5>corruption.</v>

<v Speaker 5>So arrogant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember seeing when he with a </v>

1179
00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:09.533
<v Speaker 5>closed the beaches and he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>him and his family were the only one on </v>

1180
00:55:11.731 --> 00:55:12.210
<v Speaker 5>the beach.</v>

1181
00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:13.043
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Let yourself get to that state slob.</v>

1184
00:55:19.870 --> 00:55:21.510
<v Speaker 5>And he had an operation to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>called.</v>

1187
00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:30.330

<v Speaker 5>the fourth of July.</v>

1188
00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:33.810
<v Speaker 5>And Hammond is fat family.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're just sitting there on the beach.</v>

1189
00:55:34.290 --> 00:55:37.750
<v Speaker 5>Just what an f you to everybody look at </v>
<v Speaker 5>that is extreme.</v>

1190
00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:42.180
<v Speaker 5>Nobody else allowed extreme arrogance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And why would the beaches closed down?</v>

1191
00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:44.250
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for the budget?</v>

1192
00:55:44.251 --> 00:55:45.084
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he ordered him closed because they </v>

1193
00:55:47.101 --> 00:55:49.470
<v Speaker 5>couldn't pay for people to watch the </v>
<v Speaker 5>beaches.</v>

1194
00:55:49.471 --> 00:55:52.410
<v Speaker 5>It was like one of those pissing matches</v>
<v Speaker 5>between,</v>

1195
00:55:52.411 --> 00:55:53.244
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's gonna cut what for the budget for </v>

1196
00:55:55.170 --> 00:55:57.540
<v Speaker 5>July sand portrait of him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at that.</v>

1197
00:55:57.541 --> 00:55:59.130
<v Speaker 5>Someone made fun of him in the sand.</v>

1198
00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:02.310
<v Speaker 5>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1199
00:56:02.311 --> 00:56:03.144
<v Speaker 5>The fourth of July,</v>
<v Speaker 5>looking at him in his little shower </v>

1200
00:56:04.471 --> 00:56:08.910
<v Speaker 5>sandals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think the kids call those slides.</v>

1201
00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:11.360
<v Speaker 5>They call them slides,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know the kids call those slides.</v>

1202
00:56:11.610 --> 00:56:12.960
<v Speaker 5>Slides.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I call them flip flops.</v>

1203
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:13.231
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1204
00:56:13.231 --> 00:56:14.064
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1205
00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:17.700
<v Speaker 5>When I see someone in the airport with </v>
<v Speaker 5>slides on,</v>

1206
00:56:17.701 --> 00:56:18.720
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we just want to punch him.</v>

1207
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:21.660
<v Speaker 5>It's a lot of dudes have slides in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>airport with socks on.</v>

1208
00:56:21.810 --> 00:56:22.830
<v Speaker 5>A Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1209
00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:26.890
<v Speaker 5>What are you doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why is that annoy me?</v>

1210
00:56:27.070 --> 00:56:29.440
<v Speaker 5>Because it's lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't like lazy.</v>

1211
00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:31.070
<v Speaker 5>It's lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1212
00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:33.880
<v Speaker 5>but I have those Solomon running shoes </v>
<v Speaker 5>that don't even have.</v>

1213
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:35.223
<v Speaker 5>They don't have laces.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have like this little tab you pull </v>

1214
00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:42.130
<v Speaker 5>and you pull it down and it tightens up </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you open it up and it's like velcro.</v>

1215
00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:43.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you're still pulling a tab.</v>

1216
00:56:43.790 --> 00:56:48.790
<v Speaker 5>At least there's a little something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just stick them in your feet and flop,</v>

1217
00:56:48.881 --> 00:56:51.400
<v Speaker 5>flop flop like that.</v>

1218
00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:54.010
<v Speaker 5>White people don't like that because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're lazy.</v>

1219
00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:57.520
<v Speaker 5>As comfortable as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very,</v>

1220
00:56:57.970 --> 00:57:00.370
<v Speaker 5>very excited about this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It makes me so angry,</v>

1221
00:57:00.410 --> 00:57:04.930
<v Speaker 5>but why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because you're a 25 year old man sitting</v>

1222
00:57:04.931 --> 00:57:08.140
<v Speaker 5>on the floor of an airport waiting for </v>
<v Speaker 5>your thing next year.</v>

1223
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:11.590
<v Speaker 5>Shower sandals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people do it though.</v>

1224
00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:12.663
<v Speaker 5>It's not a lot of people do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but enough people do it with the socks </v>

1225
00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:20.440
<v Speaker 5>and the slide bothers bothers me so </v>
<v Speaker 5>much.</v>

1226
00:57:20.441 --> 00:57:21.970
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why does it bother you?</v>

1227
00:57:21.971 --> 00:57:25.570
<v Speaker 5>More or less than flip flops?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a little bit more,</v>

1228
00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:29.590
<v Speaker 5>which is pretty crazy because I really </v>
<v Speaker 5>railed against people with flip flops.</v>

1229
00:57:29.591 --> 00:57:31.500
<v Speaker 5>Like Bert Kreischer wears flip flops </v>
<v Speaker 5>everywhere.</v>

1230
00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:32.950
<v Speaker 5>Disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These kind of gross.</v>

1231
00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:33.813
<v Speaker 5>It's so gross and people act like their </v>
<v Speaker 5>feet on your feet have a real bacteria </v>

1232
00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:40.330
<v Speaker 5>between the toes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's like a real,</v>

1233
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:44.400
<v Speaker 5>a real germs in there and then they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>just slick.</v>

1234
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:47.680
<v Speaker 5>Slipping them off and putting their toes</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the magazine rack.</v>

1235
00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:50.410
<v Speaker 5>But bird is like this life of the party </v>
<v Speaker 5>type character.</v>

1236
00:57:50.411 --> 00:57:52.480
<v Speaker 5>That's part of his thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's his thing.</v>

1237
00:57:52.481 --> 00:57:54.100
<v Speaker 5>I love him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love him too.</v>

1238
00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:57.240
<v Speaker 5>He's disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was.</v>

1239
00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:58.233
<v Speaker 5>There's a video of him on a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>skateboard flying down his street with </v>

1240
00:58:01.751 --> 00:58:02.860
<v Speaker 5>flip flops on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1241
00:58:02.861 --> 00:58:03.694
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you understand the damage to your </v>

1242
00:58:05.471 --> 00:58:08.260
<v Speaker 5>toes that you could do for the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 5>your life?</v>

1243
00:58:08.261 --> 00:58:09.094
<v Speaker 5>Your toes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That'd be fucked up if you crash flying </v>

1244
00:58:11.291 --> 00:58:12.730
<v Speaker 5>down the street.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The flip flops on.</v>

1245
00:58:13.210 --> 00:58:15.320
<v Speaker 5>He's hilarious now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1246
00:58:15.350 --> 00:58:18.460
<v Speaker 5>at least at least he's a character like </v>
<v Speaker 5>bigger than life character.</v>

1247
00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:21.760
<v Speaker 5>You just flip flop and you don't care </v>
<v Speaker 5>and your pants are hanging off.</v>

1248
00:58:21.761 --> 00:58:25.570
<v Speaker 5>Just to get on a flight to boise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just come on by Boise.</v>

1249
00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:27.520
<v Speaker 5>Boise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love boys.</v>

1250
00:58:27.521 --> 00:58:28.660
<v Speaker 5>I'm just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's the issue?</v>

1251
00:58:28.661 --> 00:58:31.770
<v Speaker 5>Because it's a shorter flight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't want it to be like,</v>

1252
00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:33.670
<v Speaker 5>you can't even get it together for a </v>
<v Speaker 5>short flight.</v>

1253
00:58:35.830 --> 00:58:37.240
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's disgusting.</v>

1254
00:58:37.690 --> 00:58:39.220
<v Speaker 5>It is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is weird.</v>

1255
00:58:39.221 --> 00:58:41.850
<v Speaker 5>It's just come on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His ideas about footwear.</v>

1256
00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:43.650
<v Speaker 5>I judge people when I see them with ease</v>
<v Speaker 5>on.</v>

1257
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:46.150
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Including Jamie.</v>

1258
00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:47.960
<v Speaker 5>Have something right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1259
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.940
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You gave me some.</v>

1260
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:54.000
<v Speaker 5>I don't know exactly where sat right </v>
<v Speaker 5>here when he was like six months ago.</v>

1261
00:58:54.821 --> 00:58:57.670
<v Speaker 5>Right when he gave him to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were in the box right there.</v>

1262
00:58:58.180 --> 00:58:59.013
<v Speaker 5>I've contemplated running and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>running through like Korea and filming </v>

1263
00:59:01.991 --> 00:59:03.610
<v Speaker 5>it because people love these things so </v>
<v Speaker 5>much.</v>

1264
00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:05.340
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to run it them.</v>

1265
00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:06.213
<v Speaker 5>Are they expensive?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because I like running shoes that are </v>

1266
00:59:07.331 --> 00:59:10.240
<v Speaker 5>actually supposed to be running in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1267
00:59:10.241 --> 00:59:11.080
<v Speaker 5>they're expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's,</v>

1268
00:59:11.081 --> 00:59:13.300
<v Speaker 5>he gets a look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's upset.</v>

1269
00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:15.730
<v Speaker 5>Jane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jane is one generation younger than me.</v>

1270
00:59:15.731 --> 00:59:18.520
<v Speaker 5>So his idea what these things are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is different than my.</v>

1271
00:59:18.850 --> 00:59:21.260
<v Speaker 5>I feel like they're mad at you for </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying that now.</v>

1272
00:59:21.261 --> 00:59:22.094
<v Speaker 5>Some people are.</v>

1369
01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:43.100
<v Speaker 4>gun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody told me they saw him,</v>

1370
01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:44.443
<v Speaker 4>they saw him speaking and it about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>tunnels because he's got to get </v>

1371
01:03:47.901 --> 01:03:49.160
<v Speaker 4>approval.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's different things.</v>

1372
01:03:49.161 --> 01:03:53.390
<v Speaker 4>He's got to get past and he doesn't just</v>
<v Speaker 4>want a tunnel like from here to lax,</v>

1373
01:03:53.570 --> 01:03:54.403
<v Speaker 4>he wants multiple tunnels,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so like if you're going to the united </v>

1374
01:03:56.991 --> 01:03:58.490
<v Speaker 4>terminal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it takes you right there.</v>

1375
01:03:58.491 --> 01:03:59.324
<v Speaker 4>If it goes to the American one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it takes you there and it's going to be </v>

1376
01:04:01.431 --> 01:04:05.180
<v Speaker 4>a whole like ant farm of tunnels all </v>
<v Speaker 4>through the city.</v>

1377
01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:08.610
<v Speaker 5>What happens if we get an earthquake?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happens if there's a tsunami?</v>

1378
01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:11.910
<v Speaker 5>Do those things fill up with water and </v>
<v Speaker 5>is everybody drowned inside those tubes?</v>

1379
01:04:11.970 --> 01:04:13.710
<v Speaker 5>It says the tunnels are weatherproof.</v>

1380
01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:15.133
<v Speaker 6>Hmm.</v>

1381

<v Speaker 4>What about an earthquake?</v>

1383
01:04:18.181 --> 01:04:19.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't think earthquake is weather.</v>

1384
01:04:20.430 --> 01:04:21.263

1388
01:04:28.110 --> 01:04:30.070
<v Speaker 4>I had a couple of little instances where</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was</v>

1389
01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:35.800
<v Speaker 5>and we never been claustrophobic before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nineteen 94.</v>

1390
01:04:35.801 --> 01:04:40.210
<v Speaker 5>Northridge Earthquake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No damage to la subway tunnels in 1989.</v>

1391
01:04:40.450 --> 01:04:43.000
<v Speaker 5>Loma Prieta Northern California </v>
<v Speaker 5>earthquake.</v>

1392
01:04:43.001 --> 01:04:45.420
<v Speaker 5>No damage to tunnels.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nineteen 85.</v>

1393
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:48.970
<v Speaker 5>Mexico City earthquake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No damage to tunnels which are then used</v>

1394
01:04:48.971 --> 01:04:51.130
<v Speaker 5>to transport rescue personnel.</v>

1395
01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:52.053
<v Speaker 4>The tunnels were in shape,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a big rock over the hole </v>

1396
01:04:53.831 --> 01:04:54.910
<v Speaker 4>that gets you out of the tunnel.</v>

1397
01:04:57.770 --> 01:04:59.890
<v Speaker 5>A building fell on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Try to.</v>

1398
01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:02.950
<v Speaker 5>The elevator won't take you up and now </v>
<v Speaker 5>you stuck in that little elevator living</v>

1399
01:05:02.951 --> 01:05:03.784
<v Speaker 5>in a tunnel for the rest of your life to</v>
<v Speaker 5>death in there and you get clipped by </v>

1400
01:05:07.571 --> 01:05:10.660
<v Speaker 5>some other guy in a tesla going 120 </v>
<v Speaker 5>miles an hour in the tunnel.</v>

1401
01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:14.610
<v Speaker 5>Get run over,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was turning into rat tunnels.</v>

1402
01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:17.720
<v Speaker 5>Not Big enough for you to walk in while </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's cars in now.</v>

1403
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:21.460
<v Speaker 4>I think they recently changed the plan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is going to be these things called</v>

1404
01:05:21.461 --> 01:05:24.790
<v Speaker 4>electric skates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which people get on like a subway car.</v>

1405
01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:25.631
<v Speaker 4>Like a pod?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1406
01:05:25.631 --> 01:05:27.760
<v Speaker 4>Instead of your car getting in there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but small,</v>

1407
01:05:27.761 --> 01:05:31.660
<v Speaker 4>like only like 16 people shoot right to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the airport.</v>

1408
01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:33.790
<v Speaker 4>Shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right to downtown.</v>

1409
01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:36.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be pretty cool.</v>

1410
01:05:36.431 --> 01:05:38.860
<v Speaker 4>But I don't know if I cluster,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably it will kick in.</v>

1411
01:05:39.850 --> 01:05:41.500
<v Speaker 4>And then there's another thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hyperloop,</v>

1412
01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:44.800
<v Speaker 4>he's doing that hyperloop thing to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hyperloop is the uh,</v>

1459
01:07:33.890 --> 01:07:34.723
<v Speaker 4>You put anything in the computer like </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually there was showed like a </v>

1460

<v Speaker 4>dishwasher and the guy wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 4>manufacture the part that's inside the </v>

1461
01:07:41.141 --> 01:07:43.120
<v Speaker 4>dishwasher.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The computer says,</v>

1462
01:07:44.050 --> 01:07:44.883
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can improve on that part and we're </v>

1463
01:07:46.541 --> 01:07:47.374
<v Speaker 4>going to alter the shape of it and have </v>
<v Speaker 4>it be like this and then it makes that </v>

<v Speaker 4>the raw materials you'll have like in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your machine somehow or another and </v>

1469
01:08:12.071 --> 01:08:15.100

<v Speaker 5>you'll just download the whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't need a manufacturer and no </v>

1474
01:08:25.491 --> 01:08:28.280

01:20:48.990 --> 01:20:50.520
<v Speaker 2>You're born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not you.</v>

1733
01:20:51.010 --> 01:20:53.020
<v Speaker 2>You're just who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1734
01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:56.830
<v Speaker 2>So racism is disgusting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is that,</v>

1735
01:20:56.860 --> 01:20:57.693
<v Speaker 2>is it racism?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you have that girl on stage and </v>

1736
01:21:00.191 --> 01:21:02.680
<v Speaker 2>she's singing that song that she loves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you sing,</v>

1737
01:21:02.860 --> 01:21:05.860
<v Speaker 2>it's your song like that's not really </v>
<v Speaker 2>racism.</v>

1738
01:21:05.861 --> 01:21:06.694
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when she's singing along and </v>

1739
01:21:08.021 --> 01:21:13.021
<v Speaker 2>everybody's you racist fucking Nazi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what are we doing?</v>

1740
01:21:14.370 --> 01:21:16.300
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because this is what we're doing here is</v>

1741
01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:17.350
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1742
01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:18.513
<v Speaker 2>we've gone into some ridiculous zone </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it doesn't make any sense because </v>

1743
01:21:22.751 --> 01:21:25.100
<v Speaker 2>we know that's not her intent and know </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly right.</v>

1744
01:21:26.230 --> 01:21:27.910
<v Speaker 1>Actual exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1745
01:21:27.970 --> 01:21:28.803
<v Speaker 1>It becomes like a word game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little puzzle kind of thing that </v>

1746
01:21:30.791 --> 01:21:34.540
<v Speaker 1>we're doing to trap this person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say she's very innocent up there.</v>

1747
01:21:34.541 --> 01:21:35.374
<v Speaker 1>They all know she's a little drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like setting someone up to </v>

1748
01:21:37.571 --> 01:21:38.890
<v Speaker 1>do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1749
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:40.360
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty gross.</v>

1750
01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:43.290
<v Speaker 2>It's just weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's weird that it's so universal.</v>

1751
01:21:43.291 --> 01:21:45.540
<v Speaker 2>Like that crowd that was probably 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1752
01:21:45.550 --> 01:21:46.383
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1753
01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:49.910
<v Speaker 1>they had a weird thing on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1754
01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:51.133
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1755
01:21:51.690 --> 01:21:52.523
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the show live from here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old prairie home companion show and </v>

1756
01:21:55.701 --> 01:21:56.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1757
01:21:57.020 --> 01:21:59.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm the writer for it and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had writer on it,</v>

1758
01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:02.060
<v Speaker 1>appear on it and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

1759
01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:04.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm very involved with the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1760
01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:05.893
<v Speaker 1>Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's this bluegrass guy who plays a </v>

1761
01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:10.640
<v Speaker 1>mandolin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's amazing,</v>

1762
01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:14.240
<v Speaker 1>the kindest person you'll ever meet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like super,</v>

1763
01:22:14.241 --> 01:22:16.490
<v Speaker 1>super sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweet person,</v>

1764
01:22:16.491 --> 01:22:19.310
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Mr Rogers in a way.</v>

1765
01:22:19.311 --> 01:22:20.144
<v Speaker 1>Like it's to that level of kindness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he sings everybody's birthdays and </v>

1766
01:22:24.011 --> 01:22:24.844
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he sings different songs and as </v>

1767
01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:27.621
<v Speaker 1>attributes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

1768
01:22:27.621 --> 01:22:29.150
<v Speaker 1>He loves all music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loves everything.</v>

1769
01:22:29.210 --> 01:22:33.470
<v Speaker 1>He sang a Kendrick Lamar Song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sang a little bit of it,</v>

1770
01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:34.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in like,</v>

1771
01:22:34.670 --> 01:22:35.503
<v Speaker 1>because it was his birthday that week </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he got so much hate online that a </v>

1772
01:22:39.081 --> 01:22:42.890
<v Speaker 1>white person can't be singing that song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the song about?</v>

1773
01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:44.780
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1774
01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:46.430
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't the thing.</v>

1775
01:22:46.770 --> 01:22:49.250
<v Speaker 1>It was the word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was that he was,</v>

1776
01:22:49.251 --> 01:22:50.084
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the thing that you take some </v>

1777
01:22:50.930 --> 01:22:53.800
<v Speaker 1>cultural appropriation that he's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to sing.</v>

1778
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:58.990
<v Speaker 1>And meanwhile he's singing bluegrass </v>
<v Speaker 1>Indian music from all around the world.</v>

1779
01:22:59.691 --> 01:23:02.510
<v Speaker 1>This is a kind soul celebrating </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

1780
01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:05.120
<v Speaker 1>And it really freaked him out because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>is so nice.</v>

1781
01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't believe the</v>

1782
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:06.873
<v Speaker 5>hate that he got from it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That now he's super sensitive about </v>

1783
01:23:08.801 --> 01:23:11.290
<v Speaker 5>singing that music at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not logical.</v>

1784
01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:14.470
<v Speaker 5>It's not like you have to put your foot </v>
<v Speaker 5>down and you consider the source.</v>

1785
01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:15.573
<v Speaker 5>Culturally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have to put our foot down because </v>

1786
01:23:16.601 --> 01:23:17.434
<v Speaker 5>we're going down this very strange,</v>
<v Speaker 5>illogical road where you could just </v>

1787
01:23:20.051 --> 01:23:20.884
<v Speaker 5>decide what's evil and what's bad and it</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't have any bearing on the thought </v>

1788
01:23:24.010 --> 01:23:26.710
<v Speaker 5>or the intent behind it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

1789
01:23:26.890 --> 01:23:29.830
<v Speaker 5>they went after Bruno Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1790
01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:32.200
<v Speaker 5>get in the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just get the fuck outta here.</v>

1791
01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:35.920
<v Speaker 5>They accused Bruno Mars of cultural </v>
<v Speaker 5>appropriation.</v>

1792
01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:37.270
<v Speaker 5>What culture?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's everything.</v>

1793
01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:39.790
<v Speaker 5>He's everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like the per meanwhile,</v>

1794
01:23:39.791 --> 01:23:43.060
<v Speaker 5>what is he doing where anybody would </v>
<v Speaker 5>accuse him of cultural appropriation.</v>

1795
01:23:43.061 --> 01:23:45.040
<v Speaker 5>He sings these beautiful fucking songs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1796
01:23:45.090 --> 01:23:46.930
<v Speaker 5>he's a light.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A light in this world.</v>

1797
01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:48.750
<v Speaker 5>He's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love that guy.</v>

1798
01:23:48.770 --> 01:23:49.840
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the guy's amazing.</v>

1799
01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:50.693
<v Speaker 5>Voice is fantastic and his songs are fun</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're catchy and I love listening </v>

1800
01:23:54.701 --> 01:23:55.000
<v Speaker 5>to them.</v>

1801
01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.510
<v Speaker 5>I saw them in Vegas in concert.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just the most uplifting,</v>

1802
01:23:58.511 --> 01:23:59.344
<v Speaker 5>bright thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what made me happy though is </v>

1803
01:24:01.031 --> 01:24:05.260
<v Speaker 5>that a bunch of black artists said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck you.</v>

1804
01:24:05.261 --> 01:24:07.750
<v Speaker 5>He's great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the original charge,</v>

1805
01:24:07.780 --> 01:24:08.613
<v Speaker 5>just fucking social justice warriors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going after him for cultural </v>

1806
01:24:11.111 --> 01:24:11.944
<v Speaker 5>appropriation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All these super progressive angry </v>

1807
01:24:13.901 --> 01:24:17.650
<v Speaker 5>fuckheads will decide whatever man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't have to make sense.</v>

1808
01:24:17.850 --> 01:24:20.680
<v Speaker 5>This is the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're just looking for targets.</v>

1809
01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:22.053
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't have to make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is not like a logical progression </v>

1810
01:24:25.451 --> 01:24:26.171
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1811
01:24:26.171 --> 01:24:28.000
<v Speaker 5>Bruno Mars is still.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like,</v>

1812
01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:29.133
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's stealing from these old blues </v>

1813
01:24:30.731 --> 01:24:35.140
<v Speaker 5>singers and he's not crediting them and </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a white guy from Kentucky.</v>

1814
01:24:35.141 --> 01:24:36.480
<v Speaker 5>That's not what we're dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1815
01:24:36.670 --> 01:24:37.503
<v Speaker 5>We're dealing with a multiracial guy who</v>
<v Speaker 5>sings these beautiful songs that they </v>

1816
01:24:40.841 --> 01:24:43.120
<v Speaker 5>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not cultural appropriation.</v>

1817
01:24:43.121 --> 01:24:44.620
<v Speaker 5>Even if he was white and.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1818
01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:45.880
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

1819
01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:48.790
<v Speaker 5>It's just a joy of music and music is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>mix of everything.</v>

1820
01:24:48.791 --> 01:24:49.624
<v Speaker 5>It's a mix of all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of everything that is good coming into </v>

1821
01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:54.790
<v Speaker 5>saying like his style,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if that's the case,</v>

1822
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.863
<v Speaker 5>then here's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a fucking huge fan of the black </v>

1823
01:24:58.001 --> 01:24:59.980
<v Speaker 5>keys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the black keys,</v>

1824
01:25:00.010 --> 01:25:04.390
<v Speaker 5>a whole lot of their shit is blues.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of his old blues,</v>

1825
01:25:04.391 --> 01:25:08.260
<v Speaker 5>like it sounds so similar to some great </v>
<v Speaker 5>old blues.</v>

1826
01:25:08.261 --> 01:25:11.020
<v Speaker 5>Sure is that cultural appropriation?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1827
01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:13.870
<v Speaker 5>I love them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you saying they should stop doing</v>

1828
01:25:13.871 --> 01:25:16.390
<v Speaker 5>what I what I love to hear now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Come on.</v>

1829
01:25:16.930 --> 01:25:17.741
<v Speaker 5>What are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1830
01:25:17.741 --> 01:25:19.000
<v Speaker 5>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what is it?</v>

1831
01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:21.130
<v Speaker 5>What did you know what the other part of</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is?</v>

1832
01:25:21.970 --> 01:25:24.520
<v Speaker 5>How many people are really complaining </v>
<v Speaker 5>about that stuff?</v>

1833
01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:26.650
<v Speaker 5>It's a very small amount,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's so small,</v>

1834
01:25:26.651 --> 01:25:28.660
<v Speaker 5>but it's enough where your friend got </v>
<v Speaker 5>scared.</v>

1835
01:25:28.660 --> 01:25:32.410
<v Speaker 5>He did get scared and it literally </v>
<v Speaker 5>amounts to probably three tweets.</v>

1836
01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:33.340
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1837
01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:35.260
<v Speaker 5>but those people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the only noise.</v>

1838
01:25:35.261 --> 01:25:36.760
<v Speaker 5>People aren't saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

1839
01:25:36.761 --> 01:25:39.640
<v Speaker 5>I love that version because they just </v>
<v Speaker 5>like it in the normal people.</v>

1840
01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:40.593
<v Speaker 5>It's these haters that just want to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>it and the people in control of it have </v>

1841
01:25:44.021 --> 01:25:49.021
<v Speaker 5>to calm him and make him realize we've </v>
<v Speaker 5>got your back day Bronco.</v>

1842
01:25:49.470 --> 01:25:51.970
<v Speaker 5>They'll fucking fire him if it gets loud</v>
<v Speaker 5>enough.</v>

1843
01:25:51.971 --> 01:25:55.350
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't have to make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where it's squirrely today.</v>

1844
01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:57.310
<v Speaker 5>Fired speaking to prairie home </v>
<v Speaker 5>companion.</v>

1845
01:25:57.460 --> 01:26:00.130
<v Speaker 5>They fired garrison keillor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know they fired him,</v>

1846
01:26:00.131 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 5>removed his name for everything because </v>
<v Speaker 5>he hugged the lady and his hand went</v>

1847
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:07.400
<v Speaker 2>down her back and then he apologized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sent her an email.</v>

1848
01:26:07.401 --> 01:26:08.270
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fine.</v>

1849
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:11.150
<v Speaker 2>They went back and forth with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't do anything else.</v>

1850
01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:13.970
<v Speaker 2>No history of sexual harassment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual assault,</v>

1851
01:26:14.210 --> 01:26:16.040
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>History of anything terrible.</v>

1852
01:26:16.670 --> 01:26:19.760
<v Speaker 2>Years later when all this stuff comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

1853
01:26:19.761 --> 01:26:22.310
<v Speaker 2>she comes out with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was dirty business,</v>

1854
01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:23.930
<v Speaker 2>it was dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's dirty,</v>

1855
01:26:24.230 --> 01:26:26.270
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not logical.</v>

1856
01:26:26.290 --> 01:26:27.123
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's this fever feeding </v>

1857
01:26:29.151 --> 01:26:32.450
<v Speaker 2>frenzy that goes on with these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's mob mentality.</v>

1858
01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:34.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That just wanted to tear people down.</v>

1859
01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:36.800
<v Speaker 1>They want to tear people apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really believe that you have to,</v>

1860
01:26:36.801 --> 01:26:39.560
<v Speaker 1>in all these situations is considered </v>
<v Speaker 1>the source.</v>

1861
01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:40.453
<v Speaker 1>Like you really have to consider.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when the steroid thing went </v>

1862
01:26:42.951 --> 01:26:44.170
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were like,</v>

1863
01:26:44.540 --> 01:26:45.373
<v Speaker 1>people came at Barry bonds harder than </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else because he had a rap for </v>

1864
01:26:47.691 --> 01:26:51.800
<v Speaker 1>not being a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He people did not like him regardless of</v>

1865
01:26:51.801 --> 01:26:53.240
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when it happens,</v>

1866
01:26:53.241 --> 01:26:55.770
<v Speaker 1>people kind of come after him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harder than the came after San Francisco</v>

1867
01:26:56.330 --> 01:26:57.163
<v Speaker 1>a yes and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and much harder than like Andy Pettitte </v>

1868
01:27:01.041 --> 01:27:01.874
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a pitcher for the Yankees and it's </v>

1869
01:27:04.091 --> 01:27:05.760
<v Speaker 1>just like a nice guy and he doesn't cut </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1870
01:27:05.761 --> 01:27:08.270
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if somebody is a problem,</v>

1871
01:27:08.330 --> 01:27:09.163
<v Speaker 1>Jose Conseco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a problem because he ratted </v>

1872
01:27:11.421 --> 01:27:12.590
<v Speaker 1>everybody out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1873
01:27:12.591 --> 01:27:14.150
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That book called juiced.</v>

1874
01:27:14.210 --> 01:27:15.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy dogs,</v>

1875
01:27:15.890 --> 01:27:18.500
<v Speaker 1>everything that made him persona non </v>
<v Speaker 1>grata,</v>

1876
01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:22.160
<v Speaker 1>like he kind of disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got written off from that book,</v>

1877
01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:23.990
<v Speaker 1>but people just decided,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

1878
01:27:24.050 --> 01:27:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

1879
01:27:25.161 --> 01:27:25.910
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

1880
01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:26.743
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

1881
01:27:27.210 --> 01:27:29.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Too much of a snitch I guess.</v>

1882
01:27:29.490 --> 01:27:30.211
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1883
01:27:30.211 --> 01:27:31.044
<v Speaker 2>People just didn't respect him after </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because there was so many people </v>

1884
01:27:33.631 --> 01:27:34.464
<v Speaker 2>that were also doing it and he was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>one that ratted everybody out and </v>

1885
01:27:36.511 --> 01:27:38.010
<v Speaker 2>profited off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1886
01:27:38.250 --> 01:27:39.930
<v Speaker 2>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some justice,</v>

1887
01:27:39.931 --> 01:27:44.700
<v Speaker 2>some street justice in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think that there's a little to be</v>

1888
01:27:44.701 --> 01:27:49.650
<v Speaker 2>really careful with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just there's also an issue that</v>

1889
01:27:50.130 --> 01:27:50.963
<v Speaker 2>everyone has access to social media and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone has the ability to complain </v>

1890
01:27:55.981 --> 01:27:57.120
<v Speaker 2>about things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1891
01:27:57.180 --> 01:27:58.740
<v Speaker 2>So buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a world,</v>

1892
01:27:58.741 --> 01:28:01.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of noise kind of it.</v>

1893
01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:03.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get the real sound like,</v>

1894
01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:05.153
<v Speaker 2>like there are things that happen that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are really bad and when something </v>

1895
01:28:08.311 --> 01:28:09.610
<v Speaker 2>happens it's really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1896
01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:10.583
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the twitter mob and the all the people </v>

1897
01:28:12.451 --> 01:28:15.800
<v Speaker 2>that go after these people for something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's legitimately awful.</v>

1898
01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:17.640
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense.</v>

1899
01:28:17.670 --> 01:28:18.391
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

1900
01:28:18.391 --> 01:28:19.710
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's justice to it,</v>

1901
01:28:19.950 --> 01:28:23.940
<v Speaker 2>but there's also like this constant </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for targets.</v>

1902
01:28:24.130 --> 01:28:24.963
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like that's kind of like a </v>

1903
01:28:26.890 --> 01:28:31.890
<v Speaker 1>hobby of some people like that is $100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>just to go out and pick people off.</v>

1904
01:28:31.990 --> 01:28:33.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's awful.</v>

1905
01:28:33.090 --> 01:28:33.923
<v Speaker 1>It's a horrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is up because then it's [inaudible] </v>

1906
01:28:36.730 --> 01:28:39.220
<v Speaker 1>at its best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a really wonderful thing.</v>

1907
01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:40.353
<v Speaker 1>It's a celebrate story thing that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have this community that you share with </v>

1908
01:28:42.911 --> 01:28:43.744
<v Speaker 1>and think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can see things from all around </v>

1909
01:28:45.761 --> 01:28:47.520
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could see cultures,</v>

1910
01:28:47.530 --> 01:28:48.363
<v Speaker 1>you could see young people doing amazing</v>
<v Speaker 1>things in all these different little </v>

1911
01:28:52.150 --> 01:28:54.940
<v Speaker 1>tiny spots around the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean in so many ways.</v>

1912
01:28:55.510 --> 01:28:56.343
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's just like this little </v>

1913
01:29:00.071 --> 01:29:02.100
<v Speaker 1>dark underbelly of like</v>

1914
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:02.933
<v Speaker 5>hate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're really just is good and bad in </v>

1915
01:29:05.251 --> 01:29:07.980
<v Speaker 5>the world and there are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is good and bad in the world,</v>

1916
01:29:07.981 --> 01:29:12.981
<v Speaker 5>but there's also people that are just </v>
<v Speaker 5>very frustrated and looking to vent that</v>

1917
01:29:13.321 --> 01:29:17.910
<v Speaker 5>frustration as often as they can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whatever targets they find to be viable.</v>

1918
01:29:18.210 --> 01:29:19.043
<v Speaker 5>It's not like they've carefully </v>
<v Speaker 5>considered the issue and carefully </v>

1919
01:29:21.781 --> 01:29:23.390
<v Speaker 5>consider this person stands on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1920
01:29:23.550 --> 01:29:24.383
<v Speaker 5>no for me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the big ones was the Roseanne </v>

1921
01:29:26.190 --> 01:29:31.190
<v Speaker 5>Barr thing because Roseanne Barr,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what she said seemed racist,</v>

1922
01:29:31.710 --> 01:29:33.420
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You look at it on the surface,</v>

1923
01:29:33.421 --> 01:29:36.300
<v Speaker 5>she called that lady something like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>cross between the Muslim Brotherhood and</v>

1924
01:29:36.301 --> 01:29:39.710
<v Speaker 5>the planet of the apes and like what </v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus calling a black woman and eight.</v>

1925
01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:41.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She said she didn't even know that woman</v>

1926
01:29:41.161 --> 01:29:43.260
<v Speaker 5>was black and then you see her photo and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you go,</v>

1927
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:44.190
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

1928
01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:48.120
<v Speaker 5>That woman is very racially ambiguous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I talked to her on the phone.</v>

1929
01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:50.910
<v Speaker 5>She told me she did not know that when </v>
<v Speaker 5>she goes,</v>

1930
01:29:50.911 --> 01:29:54.060
<v Speaker 5>you really think that I would call a </v>
<v Speaker 5>black lady planet of the Apes.</v>

1931
01:29:54.061 --> 01:29:58.740
<v Speaker 5>I'm not fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that was her literal words.</v>

1932
01:29:58.741 --> 01:29:59.760
<v Speaker 5>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know.</v>

1933
01:29:59.790 --> 01:30:00.623
<v Speaker 5>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just was fucked up on Ambien and </v>

1934
01:30:02.791 --> 01:30:06.060
<v Speaker 5>drinking all weekend and tweeting a </v>
<v Speaker 5>bunch of stupid shit.</v>

1935
01:30:06.090 --> 01:30:07.860
<v Speaker 5>Her own words.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's like,</v>

1936
01:30:07.890 --> 01:30:09.930
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know what I was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1937
01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:12.400
<v Speaker 5>And no one cares.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one cares that you got to.</v>

1938
01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:16.760
<v Speaker 5>A lady who has mental illness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a history of mental illness is on a</v>

1939
01:30:16.770 --> 01:30:17.603
<v Speaker 5>host of different medications,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is on Ambien as well and drinking and </v>

1940
01:30:21.091 --> 01:30:22.140
<v Speaker 5>smoking pot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one cares.</v>

1941
01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:23.183
<v Speaker 5>You compared a black woman to planet of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the apes and then all these people made </v>

1942
01:30:28.561 --> 01:30:29.394
<v Speaker 5>these memes where they put a photo of </v>
<v Speaker 5>that woman next to that woman from the </v>

1943
01:30:32.941 --> 01:30:35.280
<v Speaker 5>planet of the apes and like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1944
01:30:35.281 --> 01:30:37.770
<v Speaker 5>you see like why she was joking around </v>
<v Speaker 5>about it,</v>

1945
01:30:37.771 --> 01:30:39.150
<v Speaker 5>but it's totally off limits.</v>

1946
01:30:39.270 --> 01:30:41.820
<v Speaker 5>So they've decided she's this horrible </v>
<v Speaker 5>racist,</v>

1947
01:30:42.030 --> 01:30:47.030
<v Speaker 5>forget about all her years of people </v>
<v Speaker 5>loving her and she also has,</v>

1948
01:30:48.420 --> 01:30:50.130
<v Speaker 5>if you go back to the source kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>

1949
01:30:50.131 --> 01:30:52.720
<v Speaker 5>it's like there's a picture of her just </v>
<v Speaker 5>like a Nazi.</v>

1950
01:30:52.721 --> 01:30:54.420
<v Speaker 5>There's Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>

1951
01:30:54.421 --> 01:30:55.740
<v Speaker 5>but there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's enough.</v>

1952
01:30:55.770 --> 01:31:00.000
<v Speaker 5>She's always tweeting bombastic stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when she's got issue it's not.</v>

1953
01:31:00.001 --> 01:31:01.150
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's not like.</v>

1954
01:31:01.430 --> 01:31:02.263
<v Speaker 5>It's not like somebody like Rachel Ray </v>
<v Speaker 5>just making muffins and all of a sudden </v>

1955
01:31:06.001 --> 01:31:06.834
<v Speaker 5>one tweet comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's in that area and I think when </v>

1956
01:31:09.601 --> 01:31:10.434
<v Speaker 5>you're in that area and you're spewing </v>
<v Speaker 5>hate and you're throwing fireballs and </v>

1957
01:31:13.801 --> 01:31:15.900
<v Speaker 5>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether you have good intent or not,</v>

1958
01:31:15.930 --> 01:31:19.260
<v Speaker 5>you're in that arena.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can get burned by it.</v>

1959
01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:20.153
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's.</v>

1960
01:31:20.490 --> 01:31:22.030
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's in total shitster.</v>

1961
01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:22.993
<v Speaker 5>Remember the national anthem?</v>
<v Speaker 5>She grabs her crotch and spits on the </v>

1962
01:31:24.781 --> 01:31:27.480
<v Speaker 5>ground and apparently everyone fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>was super.</v>

1963
01:31:27.510 --> 01:31:30.750
<v Speaker 5>She was scared right after that because </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a patriotic thing.</v>

1964
01:31:30.751 --> 01:31:31.920
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't fuck.</v>

1965
01:31:32.030 --> 01:31:35.100
<v Speaker 5>Got To go home.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People were mad.</v>

1966
01:31:35.130 --> 01:31:37.710
<v Speaker 5>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The the issue that I'm with,</v>

1967
01:31:37.740 --> 01:31:38.573
<v Speaker 5>Rosanne to me is not even that tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not even even the recent planet of the </v>

1968
01:31:43.021 --> 01:31:43.854
<v Speaker 5>apes one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's an earlier one that she made five </v>

1969
01:31:45.541 --> 01:31:48.000
<v Speaker 5>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is much more racist.</v>

1970
01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:49.560
<v Speaker 5>Were hilly about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1971
01:31:49.561 --> 01:31:50.394
<v Speaker 5>about Susan Rice where she said Susan </v>
<v Speaker 5>Rice is a man with big swinging eight </v>

1972
01:31:54.451 --> 01:31:56.750
<v Speaker 5>balls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that,</v>

1973
01:31:56.770 --> 01:32:00.130
<v Speaker 5>and you're talking about an absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 5>black woman.</v>

1974
01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:02.990
<v Speaker 4>There's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something there.</v>

1975
01:32:02.991 --> 01:32:04.540
<v Speaker 4>There's the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing.</v>

1976
01:32:04.541 --> 01:32:05.374
<v Speaker 4>It's the source.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's this person that has </v>

1977
01:32:07.421 --> 01:32:08.254
<v Speaker 4>all of this kind of stuff and she's </v>
<v Speaker 4>always showing up to the line and not </v>

1978
01:32:11.411 --> 01:32:12.244
<v Speaker 4>crossing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but maybe sometimes crossing and then </v>

1979
01:32:13.751 --> 01:32:15.430
<v Speaker 4>you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to get popped.</v>

1980
01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:20.710
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember when imus got kicked off</v>
<v Speaker 4>the radio for sand about some.</v>

1981
01:32:20.770 --> 01:32:23.890
<v Speaker 4>Some gals who were athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he called them nappy headed hos.</v>

1982
01:32:23.891 --> 01:32:24.820
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>

1983
01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:27.420
<v Speaker 4>And that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa man,</v>

1984
01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:28.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1985
01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:33.280
<v Speaker 4>you want to play in those fire arenas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can get burned.</v>

1986
01:32:33.490 --> 01:32:34.323
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Occasionally you drop some bombs and </v>

1987
01:32:35.831 --> 01:32:36.664
<v Speaker 4>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1988
01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:39.820
<v Speaker 4>let me make some.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you're a shit stirrer right,</v>

1989
01:32:39.821 --> 01:32:42.670
<v Speaker 4>if that's you're trying to drop bombs </v>
<v Speaker 4>occasionally,</v>

1990
01:32:42.671 --> 01:32:47.671
<v Speaker 4>but the one shift going to land on you </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes racist bombs are the ones that</v>

1991
01:32:48.251 --> 01:32:49.390
<v Speaker 4>get you burned the most.</v>

1992
01:32:50.380 --> 01:32:53.950
<v Speaker 4>We have not healed as a nation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're this very confused.</v>

1993
01:32:54.490 --> 01:32:55.270
<v Speaker 4>We know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1994
01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:58.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we grew up like with a alcoholic,</v>

1995
01:32:58.001 --> 01:33:02.230
<v Speaker 4>dysfunctional fathers and there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a sickness.</v>

1996
01:33:02.231 --> 01:33:03.064
<v Speaker 4>Like when you talked about how there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>only 20 years between Hitler and my </v>

1997
01:33:06.041 --> 01:33:06.874
<v Speaker 4>Volkswagen coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's not that much time between the </v>

1998
01:33:10.650 --> 01:33:13.150
<v Speaker 4>most heinous part of that too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Today.</v>

1999
01:33:13.151 --> 01:33:16.370
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's what's less than 200 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is two lifetimes.</v>

2000
01:33:16.380 --> 01:33:19.000
<v Speaker 4>It's raw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were a lot of times between us and</v>

2001
01:33:19.001 --> 01:33:20.740
<v Speaker 4>slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think like just recently,</v>

2002
01:33:20.741 --> 01:33:21.574
<v Speaker 4>like the last person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>last African American person who was </v>

2003
01:33:23.921 --> 01:33:25.810
<v Speaker 4>around during slavery just passed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2004
01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:27.430
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean,</v>

2005
01:33:27.431 --> 01:33:30.610
<v Speaker 4>where we never healed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We never had a discussion.</v>

2006
01:33:30.611 --> 01:33:33.580
<v Speaker 4>We didn't go to therapy and forget about</v>
<v Speaker 4>just slavery.</v>

2007
01:33:33.581 --> 01:33:35.110
<v Speaker 4>How about the civil rights?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2008
01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:35.973
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how about in our lifetime hosing people </v>

2009
01:33:38.051 --> 01:33:40.390
<v Speaker 4>down with fire hoses and sicking dogs on</v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2010
01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:42.730
<v Speaker 4>That was in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if not our lifetime,</v>

2011
01:33:42.731 --> 01:33:44.710
<v Speaker 4>just before we were born and still </v>
<v Speaker 4>today,</v>

2012
01:33:44.711 --> 01:33:45.544
<v Speaker 4>there's still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go to certain parts pop and stuff </v>

2013
01:33:47.861 --> 01:33:49.060
<v Speaker 4>off and people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2014
01:33:49.570 --> 01:33:50.760
<v Speaker 4>as a white guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you walk around,</v>

2015
01:33:50.770 --> 01:33:51.603
<v Speaker 4>you hear people say Shit that because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they think you're safe around you and </v>

2016
01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:59.140
<v Speaker 4>you look around you and like this guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>has bred this guy.</v>

2017
01:33:59.141 --> 01:34:01.840
<v Speaker 4>He just bakes bread and stays home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I do it.</v>

2018
01:34:02.910 --> 01:34:03.520
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2019
01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:04.870
<v Speaker 4>it's tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2020
01:34:04.871 --> 01:34:07.390
<v Speaker 4>Like we have a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is our disease in our,</v>

2021
01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:08.313
<v Speaker 4>in our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is a disease that we haven't met </v>

2022
01:34:10.631 --> 01:34:12.760
<v Speaker 4>it out yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So of course like any.</v>

2023
01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:14.980
<v Speaker 4>If you're going to pop off about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be.</v>

2024
01:34:15.450 --> 01:34:17.500
<v Speaker 4>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why are you,</v>

2025
01:34:18.210 --> 01:34:19.043
<v Speaker 4>are you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's in you that makes you feel like </v>

2026
01:34:20.650 --> 01:34:22.480
<v Speaker 4>you need to turn that off?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2027
01:34:22.481 --> 01:34:23.314
<v Speaker 4>if you're Roseanne,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's her whole thing is getting this </v>

2028
01:34:25.271 --> 01:34:26.380
<v Speaker 4>little reaction to other people.</v>

2029
01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:29.260
<v Speaker 4>I mean a lot of comics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's their thing,</v>

2030
01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:31.540
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Little little,</v>

2031
01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:34.810
<v Speaker 4>little controversial things to get a </v>
<v Speaker 4>spark out of people.</v>

2032
01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:37.930
<v Speaker 4>That's fine if you and look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2033
01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:41.830
<v Speaker 4>I have a sensitivity that I don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to go in that arena because</v>

2034
01:34:41.831 --> 01:34:43.360
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even do well.</v>

2035
01:34:43.361 --> 01:34:45.910
<v Speaker 4>So when people yell at right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when people yell around me,</v>

2036
01:34:45.911 --> 01:34:48.220
<v Speaker 4>I don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not me really.</v>

2037
01:34:48.221 --> 01:34:52.230
<v Speaker 4>But anything about anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't ha.</v>

2038
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:54.760
<v Speaker 4>We're only here for a little while.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why we going to fight?</v>

2039
01:34:54.790 --> 01:34:56.170
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where I live.</v>

2040
01:34:56.500 --> 01:34:58.030
<v Speaker 4>But people that do</v>

2041
01:34:58.050 --> 01:34:59.410
<v Speaker 5>it and they.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

2042
01:34:59.411 --> 01:35:02.030
<v Speaker 5>and they and they can read.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are people that do it who can read</v>

2043
01:35:02.031 --> 01:35:04.430
<v Speaker 5>tweets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>calling them horrible things and it just</v>

2044
01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:05.850
<v Speaker 5>Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2045
01:35:06.380 --> 01:35:08.870
<v Speaker 5>bounces off and they don't really care,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think they read it.</v>

2046
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:10.850
<v Speaker 5>That's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2047
01:35:11.630 --> 01:35:15.990
<v Speaker 5>if you read tweets that are about people</v>
<v Speaker 5>that say horrible things to you,</v>

2048
01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:16.873
<v Speaker 5>I mean you're going to respond to them </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you're going to engage in dialogue </v>

2049
01:35:20.481 --> 01:35:21.770
<v Speaker 5>and then other people are going to join </v>
<v Speaker 5>in.</v>

2050
01:35:21.771 --> 01:35:23.780
<v Speaker 5>You can respond to all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You won't have any time.</v>

2051
01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:25.190
<v Speaker 5>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no time.</v>

2052
01:35:25.310 --> 01:35:26.143
<v Speaker 5>You won't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your whole day will be just speeding up </v>

2053
01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:29.533
<v Speaker 5>with new people jumping into the fray.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like if you want to have a </v>

2054
01:35:31.821 --> 01:35:33.950
<v Speaker 5>fistfight with a mob,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a mob of people,</v>

2055
01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:38.900
<v Speaker 5>you can't really do that because he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to have a discussion with a one on</v>

2056
01:35:38.901 --> 01:35:41.540
<v Speaker 5>one person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you fight a whole crowd of people</v>

2057
01:35:41.541 --> 01:35:42.470
<v Speaker 5>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kendrick Lamar,</v>

2058
01:35:42.590 --> 01:35:44.240
<v Speaker 5>if that lady was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck you bitch.</v>

2059
01:35:44.490 --> 01:35:45.323
<v Speaker 5>I say that word like knuckles up and </v>
<v Speaker 5>dives in the crowd starts throwing </v>

2060
01:35:50.211 --> 01:35:51.044
<v Speaker 5>haymakers going to get fucking killed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if she has a discussion with one of </v>

2061
01:35:55.041 --> 01:35:58.760
<v Speaker 5>those white guys is doing this booboo </v>
<v Speaker 5>that was just yelling it out himself.</v>

2062
01:35:58.970 --> 01:36:02.030
<v Speaker 5>If they put them alone in a room and she</v>
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>

2063
01:36:02.031 --> 01:36:04.310
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tell me why what I did was wrong.</v>

2064
01:36:05.150 --> 01:36:06.980
<v Speaker 5>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ralphie May,</v>

2065
01:36:08.210 --> 01:36:10.910
<v Speaker 5>it's just fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You shouldn't use that word.</v>

2066
01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:12.170
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't use that word.</v>

2067
01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:13.190
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>motherfucker,</v>

2068
01:36:13.191 --> 01:36:15.390
<v Speaker 5>you were saying it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's saying no,</v>

2069
01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:15.591
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2070
01:36:15.591 --> 01:36:19.760
<v Speaker 5>I say with everybody else and I make the</v>
<v Speaker 5>noise with my face.</v>

2071
01:36:19.830 --> 01:36:20.930
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I opened my mouth.</v>

2072
01:36:20.931 --> 01:36:23.150
<v Speaker 5>I almost say about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't say no,</v>

2073
01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:24.433
<v Speaker 5>don't say I don't say it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I kind of started and then I let other </v>

2074
01:36:27.861 --> 01:36:28.694
<v Speaker 5>people end it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like do the end part or I'll do the god </v>

2075
01:36:31.371 --> 01:36:33.680
<v Speaker 5>part.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't do the in between.</v>

2076
01:36:33.681 --> 01:36:36.980
<v Speaker 5>I don't do a whole word because that way</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not racist.</v>

2077
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.540
<v Speaker 5>It's so complex.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's too crazy.</v>

2078
01:36:41.570 --> 01:36:43.760
<v Speaker 5>But it's not complex.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's stupid.</v>

2079
01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:46.610
<v Speaker 5>It is complex.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what's complex about that?</v>

2080
01:36:47.060 --> 01:36:49.060
<v Speaker 5>Well not that just that issue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what,</v>

2081
01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:49.993
<v Speaker 5>what's complex about that to me is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you have a whole crowd of people </v>

2082
01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:55.000
<v Speaker 5>yelling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>responding this way.</v>

2083
01:36:55.010 --> 01:36:58.070
<v Speaker 5>Like it's on their minds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're having these discussions that we</v>

2084
01:36:58.071 --> 01:37:00.210
<v Speaker 5>are trying to move things forward.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Other people trying to move in,</v>

2085
01:37:00.211 --> 01:37:01.760
<v Speaker 5>get back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is complex.</v>

2086
01:37:01.810 --> 01:37:04.220
<v Speaker 5>Let's try and move it back who's </v>
<v Speaker 5>actively saying,</v>

2087
01:37:04.221 --> 01:37:05.054
<v Speaker 5>I mean other than like white nationalist</v>
<v Speaker 5>groups that everybody pretty much hates </v>

2088
01:37:08.451 --> 01:37:09.284
<v Speaker 5>other than themselves I guess and move </v>
<v Speaker 5>it back and then other people who think </v>

2089
01:37:11.751 --> 01:37:12.584
<v Speaker 5>that maybe that they're being that is </v>
<v Speaker 5>being reversed and that they're being </v>

2090
01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:16.573
<v Speaker 5>hated on now when they white like young </v>
<v Speaker 5>white kid who just wants to have a good </v>

2091

<v Speaker 5>time at the concert and the single wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>

01:37:22.890 --> 01:37:25.010
<v Speaker 5>I were.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were trying to be this way.</v>

2094
01:37:25.070 --> 01:37:25.903
<v Speaker 5>Someone put up some fitness at a school </v>
<v Speaker 5>that was criticized by a dean and was </v>

2095
01:37:29.001 --> 01:37:29.834
<v Speaker 5>taken down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They put up these signs that say it's </v>

2096

<v Speaker 5>or whoever it was that he said,</v>

2098

<v Speaker 5>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they put up these signs that said it's </v>

2099
01:37:44.781 --> 01:37:49.250
<v Speaker 5>okay to be white and people were angry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2100
01:37:49.251 --> 01:37:51.530
<v Speaker 5>It's like white lives matter kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

2101
01:37:51.570 --> 01:37:52.920
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just that statement.</v>

2102
01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:56.100
<v Speaker 5>It's okay to be white.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like why would have a problem with that?</v>

2103
01:37:56.130 --> 01:37:56.963
<v Speaker 5>Like you didn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are you thinking about people that </v>

2104
01:37:59.971 --> 01:38:00.990
<v Speaker 5>aren't white?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are you going to?</v>

2105
01:38:01.010 --> 01:38:02.190
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what I mean.</v>

2106
01:38:02.191 --> 01:38:04.140
<v Speaker 5>It is complex.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's complex.</v>

2107
01:38:04.141 --> 01:38:05.460
<v Speaker 5>Or is that fucking stupid?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here it is.</v>

2108
01:38:05.700 --> 01:38:07.740
<v Speaker 5>Sign saying it's okay to be white.</v>

2109
01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:09.520
<v Speaker 5>Found at Maryland.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Highschool.</v>

2110
01:38:10.230 --> 01:38:12.720
<v Speaker 5>Found.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Found bomb.</v>

2111
01:38:12.730 --> 01:38:13.563
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2112
01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:15.210
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what does it say?</v>

2113
01:38:15.211 --> 01:38:16.044
<v Speaker 5>Something at 5:45</v>
<v Speaker 5>AM and removed by staff before students </v>

2114
01:38:20.191 --> 01:38:22.800
<v Speaker 5>arrive for classes also say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>discovered them.</v>

2115
01:38:23.790 --> 01:38:25.320
<v Speaker 5>We're taking this seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

2116
01:38:25.321 --> 01:38:26.154
<v Speaker 5>They sent a letter home to families </v>
<v Speaker 5>informing them that the signs were </v>

2117
01:38:28.591 --> 01:38:29.424
<v Speaker 5>discovered on 10 doors at 5:45</v>
<v Speaker 5>AM and removed by staff before students </v>

2118
01:38:33.361 --> 01:38:34.194
<v Speaker 5>arrive for classes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're taking this seriously and are </v>

2119
01:38:36.211 --> 01:38:39.000
<v Speaker 5>investigating this incident.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wrote Renee Johnson,</v>

2120
01:38:39.001 --> 01:38:39.834
<v Speaker 5>the school's principal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Our research so far has indicated this </v>

2121
01:38:42.391 --> 01:38:43.224
<v Speaker 5>may be a part of a concerted national </v>
<v Speaker 5>campaign to format racial and political </v>

2122
01:38:47.521 --> 01:38:48.354
<v Speaker 5>tension in our school and community.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The same flyer was posted in other </v>

2123
01:38:51.481 --> 01:38:53.700
<v Speaker 5>cities and communities this week.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2124
01:38:53.940 --> 01:38:54.773
<v Speaker 5>But here's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you disagree with the sentiment of </v>

2125
01:38:57.991 --> 01:38:59.820
<v Speaker 5>that statement?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is okay to be white.</v>

2126
01:38:59.821 --> 01:39:02.610
<v Speaker 5>It's okay to be Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's okay to be Indian.</v>

2127
01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:04.830
<v Speaker 5>It's okay to be whatever the fuck you </v>
<v Speaker 5>are.</v>

2128
01:39:05.370 --> 01:39:06.203
<v Speaker 5>Not Okay to be racist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe if they wrote it's okay to be </v>

2129
01:39:07.831 --> 01:39:09.660
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not okay to be racist.</v>

2130
01:39:09.810 --> 01:39:10.643
<v Speaker 5>Maybe if they did that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would that be an issue that would've </v>

2131
01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:13.530
<v Speaker 5>been.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would've helped write.</v>

2132
01:39:13.590 --> 01:39:14.411
<v Speaker 5>That would have helped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you,</v>

2133
01:39:14.411 --> 01:39:16.800
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you walk into your school campus and all</v>

2134
01:39:16.801 --> 01:39:20.880
<v Speaker 5>of a sudden there's signs up everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 5>that normally there are no signs.</v>

2135
01:39:20.910 --> 01:39:21.743
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they feel if they're a white person </v>

2136
01:39:22.771 --> 01:39:26.040
<v Speaker 5>and they feel like they're being openly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>racially discriminated against,</v>

2137
01:39:26.730 --> 01:39:28.320
<v Speaker 5>is it okay to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

2138
01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:30.600
<v Speaker 5>it's all right to be white.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that okay?</v>

2139
01:39:30.630 --> 01:39:31.080
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's.</v>

2140
01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:32.010
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course.</v>

2141
01:39:32.011 --> 01:39:34.980
<v Speaker 5>So what's wrong with that sign?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because you pop them up in the middle of</v>

2142
01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:35.813
<v Speaker 5>the night and put them all up on it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>keystone come in with your little lunch </v>

2143
01:39:37.861 --> 01:39:38.694
<v Speaker 5>bag and you're going to teach her </v>
<v Speaker 5>Spanish class and on your doors a sign </v>

2144
01:39:41.581 --> 01:39:42.151
<v Speaker 5>that says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2145
01:39:42.151 --> 01:39:44.040
<v Speaker 5>to be white,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just,</v>

2146
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:45.630
<v Speaker 5>your knee jerk reaction is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoa.</v>

2147
01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:46.590
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are you doing?</v>

2148
01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:48.133
<v Speaker 5>The fliers appear to be a part of an </v>
<v Speaker 5>online campaign that is detailed on the </v>

2149
01:39:51.961 --> 01:39:53.370
<v Speaker 5>web forum.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Four Chan.</v>

2150
01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:55.320
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But is it a that.</v>

2151
01:39:56.070 --> 01:39:56.903
<v Speaker 5>But is that saying that for chance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about this online campaign or </v>

2152
01:40:00.330 --> 01:40:02.550
<v Speaker 5>this saying that four Chan started this </v>
<v Speaker 5>online campaign.</v>

2153
01:40:02.551 --> 01:40:03.384
<v Speaker 5>I would lean towards that because it was</v>
<v Speaker 5>Halloween night and they discovered on </v>

2154
01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:06.533
<v Speaker 5>the article was posted November first.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's not like it's just a fun </v>

2155
01:40:09.811 --> 01:40:12.360
<v Speaker 5>halloween prank,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like people do do that stuff,</v>

2156
01:40:13.060 --> 01:40:14.330
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2157
01:40:14.430 --> 01:40:16.150
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's totally okay to think it.</v>

2158
01:40:16.151 --> 01:40:16.984
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like the guy with the bumper </v>

2159
01:40:18.451 --> 01:40:19.284
<v Speaker 5>stickers all over his car there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those guys are a little more unhinged </v>

2160
01:40:23.731 --> 01:40:24.900
<v Speaker 5>than the other people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2161
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:26.070
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's okay to be.</v>

2162
01:40:26.071 --> 01:40:29.010
<v Speaker 5>Why do I have to make a sign?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do I have to go get copies?</v>

2163
01:40:29.011 --> 01:40:31.380
<v Speaker 5>Do I have to get some tape?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do I have to sneak on campus?</v>

2164
01:40:31.410 --> 01:40:32.243
<v Speaker 5>Do I have to put it up there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was an article in Washington Post </v>

2165
01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:38.610
<v Speaker 5>Google this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This woman wrote this article,</v>

2166
01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:39.473
<v Speaker 5>why can't we hate men?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it was published in the Washington </v>

2167
01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:46.170
<v Speaker 5>Post and of course had a photo of Harvey</v>
<v Speaker 5>Weinstein.</v>

2168
01:40:46.171 --> 01:40:47.880
<v Speaker 5>Who's a disgusting man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2169
01:40:47.881 --> 01:40:51.320
<v Speaker 5>And this is the perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that is literally like.</v>

2170
01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:53.080
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what does that mean?</v>

2171
01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:54.370
<v Speaker 5>The worst</v>

2172
01:40:54.370 --> 01:40:56.260
<v Speaker 4>white man?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hitler,</v>

2173
01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:58.600
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why can't we hate white men?</v>

2174
01:40:58.830 --> 01:41:00.530
<v Speaker 4>Because all white men are Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2175
01:41:00.570 --> 01:41:02.790
<v Speaker 4>Can't we hate white people?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that what the article was?</v>

2176
01:41:03.070 --> 01:41:04.840
<v Speaker 4>The Article?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the article says.</v>

2177
01:41:04.841 --> 01:41:05.674
<v Speaker 4>I didn't read it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean like how could you write an </v>

2178
01:41:07.511 --> 01:41:11.770
<v Speaker 4>article that says why can't we hate men?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you want to get.</v>

2179
01:41:11.970 --> 01:41:12.803
<v Speaker 4>Unless you're trying to say we can hate </v>
<v Speaker 4>men because men are human and we got to </v>

2180
01:41:15.161 --> 01:41:17.860
<v Speaker 4>give everybody a chance and we can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>generalize.</v>

2181
01:41:17.890 --> 01:41:20.830
<v Speaker 4>Even if men have done horrible things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd have to read it.</v>

2182
01:41:20.831 --> 01:41:21.400
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2183
01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:25.550
<v Speaker 4>it's definitely the headline is made to </v>

2196
01:41:56.651 --> 01:41:59.110
<v Speaker 4>and do things and protect themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not what this is.</v>

2197
01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:01.090
<v Speaker 4>This is people trying to get attention </v>
<v Speaker 4>for their work.</v>

<v Speaker 4>little campaigns against people.</v>

2200
01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:09.670
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2201
01:42:09.671 --> 01:42:10.504
<v Speaker 4>people love that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All I would've had to do with this book </v>

2202
01:42:12.821 --> 01:42:13.730
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is right.</v>

2203
01:42:13.810 --> 01:42:17.390
<v Speaker 4>Something about trump in it and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people could sound bite.</v>

2204
01:42:17.490 --> 01:42:18.323
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2205
01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:20.410
<v Speaker 4>And I ended up and have a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>be like,</v>

2206
01:42:20.411 --> 01:42:22.210
<v Speaker 4>what is and get everybody talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2207
01:42:22.450 --> 01:42:23.620
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what they're doing.</v>

2208
01:42:23.650 --> 01:42:24.483
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to make up make noise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So people look at them and they make </v>

2209
01:42:27.791 --> 01:42:29.050
<v Speaker 4>more money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2210
01:42:29.051 --> 01:42:32.410
<v Speaker 4>and then there's also mean there has to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be a thought behind it like that.</v>

2211
01:42:32.411 --> 01:42:34.660
<v Speaker 4>Men have done some horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shitty things.</v>

2212
01:42:35.020 --> 01:42:35.853
<v Speaker 4>So the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the idea of why can't you </v>

2213
01:42:36.671 --> 01:42:37.504
<v Speaker 4>generalize?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>

2214
01:42:37.540 --> 01:42:38.373
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't generalize because you're a </v>

2215
01:42:38.801 --> 01:42:40.310
<v Speaker 4>nuanced human being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2216
01:42:40.330 --> 01:42:44.980
<v Speaker 4>You're supposed to be able to understand</v>
<v Speaker 4>full well every one is different.</v>

2217
01:42:45.070 --> 01:42:46.910
<v Speaker 4>Literally every,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every sing,</v>

2218
01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:47.793
<v Speaker 4>there's hundred and 50 million men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea of why can't you hate all of </v>

2219
01:42:51.191 --> 01:42:52.024
<v Speaker 4>them while you can if you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a ridiculous way to live your </v>

2220
01:42:55.751 --> 01:42:56.584
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2221
01:42:56.710 --> 01:42:58.300
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

2222
01:42:58.301 --> 01:42:59.134
<v Speaker 4>So you means if you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are you straight and you were </v>

2223
01:43:02.381 --> 01:43:03.214
<v Speaker 4>attracted to men and you have to hate </v>
<v Speaker 4>them all in quarantine yourself away </v>

2224
01:43:05.441 --> 01:43:06.750
<v Speaker 4>from just a lot of those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2225
01:43:06.790 --> 01:43:08.680
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of really good people out </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

2226
01:43:09.010 --> 01:43:11.980
<v Speaker 4>It's father's Day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How often does that have to happen with,</v>

2227
01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:15.370
<v Speaker 4>with people who are homophobic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who hate gay people,</v>

2228
01:43:15.850 --> 01:43:18.730
<v Speaker 4>rally against gay marriage and rally </v>
<v Speaker 4>against gay rights,</v>

2229
01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:20.560
<v Speaker 4>and then you find out that they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>really gay.</v>

2230

<v Speaker 4>he was sleeping with theirs.</v>

2236

2239
01:43:38.211 --> 01:43:39.044
<v Speaker 4>Look for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When someone talks about gay is a sin </v>

2240
01:43:41.681 --> 01:43:42.514
<v Speaker 4>against men and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we should lock them up and we should do </v>

2241
01:43:44.501 --> 01:43:45.390
<v Speaker 4>this from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>someone sucking Dick on the sneak dip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2243
01:43:48.010 --> 01:43:50.260
<v Speaker 4>Let's follow that dude around them </v>
<v Speaker 4>behind.</v>

2244
01:43:50.690 --> 01:43:52.040
<v Speaker 4>We're going to find this on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're</v>

2245
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:53.550
<v Speaker 5>going to find it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2246
01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:54.740
<v Speaker 5>I'll find it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2247
01:43:54.741 --> 01:43:56.300
<v Speaker 5>that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is what people do.</v>

2248
01:43:56.630 --> 01:44:00.620
<v Speaker 5>I think what I like about what you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying and how I feel too,</v>

2249
01:44:00.830 --> 01:44:02.450
<v Speaker 5>is that we need to be nice to each </v>
<v Speaker 5>other.</v>

2250
01:44:02.690 --> 01:44:03.523
<v Speaker 5>We this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this whole idea of this gotcha bullshit </v>

2251
01:44:05.931 --> 01:44:06.764
<v Speaker 5>and this attacking people for things </v>
<v Speaker 5>that don't necessarily make sense </v>

2252
01:44:09.711 --> 01:44:11.480
<v Speaker 5>without,</v>
<v Speaker 5>without nuance,</v>

2253
01:44:11.481 --> 01:44:15.260
<v Speaker 5>without the understanding of complexity </v>
<v Speaker 5>of human interaction,</v>

2254
01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:18.890
<v Speaker 5>with no concern for that at all because </v>
<v Speaker 5>you just want to target,</v>

2255
01:44:19.300 --> 01:44:19.780
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2256
01:44:19.780 --> 01:44:20.613
<v Speaker 5>we have to shun that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That stuff is just pure foolishness and </v>

2257
01:44:25.161 --> 01:44:28.490
<v Speaker 5>it's bad for discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's bad for community.</v>

2258
01:44:28.491 --> 01:44:30.200
<v Speaker 5>It's bad for the way we communicate with</v>
<v Speaker 5>each other,</v>

2259
01:44:30.230 --> 01:44:33.440
<v Speaker 5>generates more hate and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's also a generalization,</v>

2260
01:44:33.441 --> 01:44:36.380
<v Speaker 5>a gross generalization,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is just the same thing as sexism.</v>

2261
01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:38.390
<v Speaker 5>It's the same thing as racism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the same.</v>

2262
01:44:38.420 --> 01:44:39.253
<v Speaker 5>It's the same thing.</v>

2263
01:44:39.380 --> 01:44:42.730
<v Speaker 5>Why can't we hate men as a gross </v>
<v Speaker 5>generalization like that state.</v>

2264
01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:45.110
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what the article said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that statement,</v>

2265
01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:48.350
<v Speaker 5>that's a gross general.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't because you're a nice person.</v>

2266
01:44:48.500 --> 01:44:49.850
<v Speaker 5>I assume you're a nice person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2267
01:44:50.500 --> 01:44:52.010
<v Speaker 5>because we don't hate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How about that?</v>

2268
01:44:52.610 --> 01:44:55.310
<v Speaker 5>How about we try not to hate him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You Hate Justin Trudeau.</v>

2269
01:44:55.311 --> 01:44:57.860
<v Speaker 5>That kind of seems like a sweater,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I seems awesome.</v>

2270
01:44:57.861 --> 01:44:59.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Trump trump week.</v>

2274
01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:08.340

<v Speaker 5>the culture has enough hate it.</v>

2275
01:45:08.460 --> 01:45:12.060
<v Speaker 5>I think the campaign has to be for more </v>
<v Speaker 5>kindness over that.</v>

2276
01:45:12.100 --> 01:45:12.933
<v Speaker 5>That's a great picture of him sitting </v>
<v Speaker 5>there with his arms crossed and they're </v>

2277

2412
01:51:52.960 --> 01:51:56.740
<v Speaker 5>Try to keep the bloodline pure and to </v>
<v Speaker 5>try to keep all the money in the family.</v>

2413
01:51:57.640 --> 01:51:58.860
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's true.</v>

2414
01:51:59.110 --> 01:52:01.110
<v Speaker 5>Did you ever see his head?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is headed plank?</v>

2415
01:52:01.830 --> 01:52:05.320
<v Speaker 5>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pull up a photo of King Tucking.</v>

2416
01:52:05.321 --> 01:52:06.154
<v Speaker 5>Ted's been head skull.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had this weird shaped deformed skull </v>

2417
01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:14.110
<v Speaker 5>and a club foot and all the depictions </v>
<v Speaker 5>of his body.</v>

2418
01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:17.310
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's a weird head.</v>

2419
01:52:17.340 --> 01:52:20.710
<v Speaker 5>Like look how big his head stuck up in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the back.</v>

2420
01:52:21.030 --> 01:52:21.863
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're.</v>

2421
01:52:21.940 --> 01:52:25.240
<v Speaker 5>He was essentially inbred like there was</v>
<v Speaker 5>something wrong with him.</v>

2422
01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:28.270
<v Speaker 5>Was he a good king?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was only around for a little while.</v>

2423
01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:31.840
<v Speaker 5>He was just because we found his stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2424
01:52:31.930 --> 01:52:35.410
<v Speaker 5>it's not like he had that much global </v>
<v Speaker 5>impact or did he?</v>

2425
01:52:35.950 --> 01:52:37.120
<v Speaker 5>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>

2426
01:52:37.210 --> 01:52:39.990
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's got a weird little stories.</v>

2427
01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.550
<v Speaker 5>Amazing of how they found it and the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the exhibit.</v>

2428
01:52:42.551 --> 01:52:45.750
<v Speaker 5>They have this imax movie that goes </v>
<v Speaker 5>along with the exhibit a</v>

2429
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:49.070
<v Speaker 2>fucking bad ass because the imax screen </v>
<v Speaker 2>is gigantic.</v>

2430
01:52:49.071 --> 01:52:50.330
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you're there,</v>

2431
01:52:50.331 --> 01:52:54.170
<v Speaker 2>you get a real sense of how big these </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures actually are.</v>

2432
01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:55.033
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they were looking for it for five </v>

2433
01:52:57.081 --> 01:52:58.790
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy,</v>

2434
01:52:58.810 --> 01:53:03.810
<v Speaker 2>this British guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this kid named Hussein who was the,</v>

2435
01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:04.821
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2436
01:53:04.821 --> 01:53:07.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would get water for all the workers.</v>

2437
01:53:07.580 --> 01:53:08.413
<v Speaker 2>He was clearing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he had these water pots and they </v>

2438
01:53:10.700 --> 01:53:11.533
<v Speaker 2>set them into the ground so that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>could come scoop water while they're </v>

2439
01:53:13.840 --> 01:53:15.710
<v Speaker 2>digging and trying to find these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2440
01:53:16.010 --> 01:53:18.130
<v Speaker 2>well they're trying to find this tomb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2441
01:53:18.230 --> 01:53:22.910
<v Speaker 2>he found a step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He put the water bottle down,</v>

2442
01:53:23.210 --> 01:53:24.043
<v Speaker 2>he cleared some dirt away and he found </v>
<v Speaker 2>this flat rock just randomly flat rock </v>

2443
01:53:28.761 --> 01:53:31.550
<v Speaker 2>was the steel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This one of the stairs that lead down to</v>

2444
01:53:31.551 --> 01:53:32.384
<v Speaker 2>the tomb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was the only time that they ever </v>

2445
01:53:33.621 --> 01:53:37.730
<v Speaker 2>found that was completely untouched.</v>

2446
01:53:38.150 --> 01:53:38.983
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2447
01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:41.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is grave robbers.</v>

2448
01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:43.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grave robbers had found every other tomb</v>

2449
01:53:43.490 --> 01:53:44.420
<v Speaker 2>because they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh really?</v>

2450
01:53:44.421 --> 01:53:47.450
<v Speaker 2>They've tombs were miles away from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pyramids because,</v>

2451
01:53:48.530 --> 01:53:49.363
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they probably had tombs in the pyramids </v>

2452
01:53:50.781 --> 01:53:53.180
<v Speaker 2>that were rated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they realize after a while,</v>

2453
01:53:53.181 --> 01:53:54.560
<v Speaker 2>a quick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got to hide these things.</v>

2454
01:53:54.860 --> 01:53:55.693
<v Speaker 2>So they took them way far out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>miles and miles away and they put them </v>

2455
01:53:59.810 --> 01:54:03.920
<v Speaker 2>in these hillsides and they put them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thieves found them there too.</v>

2456
01:54:04.100 --> 01:54:05.090
<v Speaker 2>She.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when.</v>

2457
01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:09.710
<v Speaker 2>So it was that one like underground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did they build it that way or over time?</v>

2458
01:54:10.130 --> 01:54:10.821
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was underground.</v>

2459
01:54:10.821 --> 01:54:13.400
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

2460
01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:15.370
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool way to discover some.</v>

2461
01:54:15.420 --> 01:54:16.253
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One kid and he was the first one in the </v>

2462
01:54:18.441 --> 01:54:21.290
<v Speaker 2>tomb to because he was tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when they busted the whole,</v>

2463
01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:22.393
<v Speaker 2>they busted a hole through the wall and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he climbed in with a light around and </v>

2464
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:27.620
<v Speaker 2>you see anything down there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>billy?</v>

2465
01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:28.693
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's part of the film is the </v>

2466
01:54:30.290 --> 01:54:31.123
<v Speaker 2>archeologists like looking through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hole and seeing like the goals and all </v>

2467
01:54:34.791 --> 01:54:38.600
<v Speaker 2>this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First chip through the whole God.</v>

2468
01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:41.990
<v Speaker 2>Thousands and thousands of years </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely untouched.</v>

2469
01:54:42.050 --> 01:54:43.700
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

2470
01:54:43.701 --> 01:54:44.534
<v Speaker 2>And then you've take that one thing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>a big giant rock ball starts rolling </v>

2471
01:54:47.391 --> 01:54:52.100
<v Speaker 2>after you like Indiana Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a remarkable moment.</v>

2472
01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:54.920
<v Speaker 2>Is really interesting because like they </v>
<v Speaker 2>had like a glove,</v>

2473
01:54:54.980 --> 01:54:58.730
<v Speaker 2>a linen glove that was 3000 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2474
01:54:58.731 --> 01:55:01.730
<v Speaker 2>And you're looking at this linen glove,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sandals,</v>

2475
01:55:02.060 --> 01:55:06.080
<v Speaker 2>they had the sarcophagus and sandals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he had like these sort of,</v>

2476
01:55:06.081 --> 01:55:07.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2477
01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:08.353
<v Speaker 2>decorative sandals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how long were they making that stuff </v>

2478
01:55:10.351 --> 01:55:12.260
<v Speaker 2>even been before then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's 3000 years,</v>

2479
01:55:12.261 --> 01:55:14.120
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even before that,</v>

2480
01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:15.433
<v Speaker 2>I had a guy recently Dr Robert Schoch </v>
<v Speaker 2>from Boston University and he's a </v>

2481
01:55:19.761 --> 01:55:20.594
<v Speaker 2>geologist and he is one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's one of the first people to propose </v>

2482
01:55:25.311 --> 01:55:26.610
<v Speaker 2>the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one of the first,</v>

2483
01:55:26.611 --> 01:55:30.440
<v Speaker 2>like real scholars to propose the idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the sphinx is far,</v>

2484
01:55:30.441 --> 01:55:35.441
<v Speaker 2>far older than people think it is and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's not from 2,500</v>

2485
01:55:35.481 --> 01:55:37.820
<v Speaker 2>BC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's from way before that,</v>

2486
01:55:37.821 --> 01:55:38.654
<v Speaker 2>perhaps maybe 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years old in that because it has water </v>

2487
01:55:41.271 --> 01:55:41.810
<v Speaker 2>erosion.</v>

2488
01:55:41.810 --> 01:55:45.570
<v Speaker 2>All of it can only have come from </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years of rainfall.</v>

2489
01:55:46.870 --> 01:55:47.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

2490
01:55:47.770 --> 01:55:49.760
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what's the implication of that?</v>

2491
01:55:49.940 --> 01:55:52.550
<v Speaker 2>The implication is that his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2492
01:55:52.551 --> 01:55:53.384
<v Speaker 2>his take on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really interesting and he </v>

2493
01:55:56.210 --> 01:55:58.100
<v Speaker 2>really scared the shit out of me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>blew my mind.</v>

2494
01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:02.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mass coronal inject a ejections.</v>

2495
01:56:02.630 --> 01:56:03.463
<v Speaker 2>So something from the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some gigantic solar flare that created </v>

2496
01:56:08.420 --> 01:56:09.253
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable havoc on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was talking about lightning storms </v>

2497
01:56:15.470 --> 01:56:16.303
<v Speaker 2>that were like the lightning coming down</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sheets of rain in a hurricane and </v>

2498
01:56:21.531 --> 01:56:22.364
<v Speaker 2>that it just covered parts of the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lightning and killed everything and </v>

2499
01:56:27.381 --> 01:56:32.280
<v Speaker 2>killed off mass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just mass numbers of human beings.</v>

2500
01:56:32.290 --> 01:56:34.710
<v Speaker 2>Large mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's responsible for.</v>

2501
01:56:34.860 --> 01:56:35.693
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a big mass extinction that we </v>

2502
01:56:37.201 --> 01:56:42.201
<v Speaker 2>really don't understand what caused </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in that range of around 10,000</v>

2503
01:56:42.391 --> 01:56:43.224
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he attributes that to this mass </v>

2504
01:56:45.301 --> 01:56:48.750
<v Speaker 2>coronal objection and that this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this huge sun,</v>

2505
01:56:48.990 --> 01:56:49.823
<v Speaker 2>this burst of energy from the Sun caused</v>
<v Speaker 2>these unbelievable chaotic storms that </v>

2506
01:56:55.981 --> 01:56:56.814
<v Speaker 2>killed.</v>

2507
01:56:56.910 --> 01:56:58.310
<v Speaker 2>Who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>count he.</v>

2508
01:56:58.320 --> 01:56:59.470
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so is it like,</v>

2509
01:56:59.820 --> 01:57:02.700
<v Speaker 2>like a thunderstorm times 100.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2510
01:57:02.701 --> 01:57:03.534
<v Speaker 2>no times a million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like sheets and a million sheets </v>

2511
01:57:07.591 --> 01:57:10.710
<v Speaker 2>of lightning coming down like rain in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hurricane.</v>

2512
01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:14.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh my goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine lightning just cooking the earth</v>

2513
01:57:14.790 --> 01:57:19.140
<v Speaker 2>for a long period of time or just one </v>
<v Speaker 2>big storm long period of time.</v>

2514
01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:19.993
<v Speaker 2>Like still sun just kept people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>studied living in caves and they built </v>

2515
01:57:23.161 --> 01:57:26.790
<v Speaker 2>these dwellings inside the earth because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was where they can survive,</v>

2516
01:57:26.791 --> 01:57:29.310
<v Speaker 2>they can survive where the radiation </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't coming down,</v>

2517
01:57:29.370 --> 01:57:31.230
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't going through the earth to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>to them.</v>

2518
01:57:31.590 --> 01:57:33.390
<v Speaker 2>So houses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tents,</v>

2519
01:57:33.630 --> 01:57:34.463
<v Speaker 2>and I think that you lived in that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside that those people were dead </v>

2520
01:57:37.900 --> 01:57:40.410
<v Speaker 2>because the only people that live or the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that lived there had their houses</v>

2521
01:57:40.411 --> 01:57:42.780
<v Speaker 2>carved into hillsides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there evidence of this?</v>

2522
01:57:42.781 --> 01:57:43.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2523
01:57:43.250 --> 01:57:44.083
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Evidence,</v>

2524
01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:47.250
<v Speaker 2>geological evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which was it a mainstream thing or is it</v>

2525
01:57:47.251 --> 01:57:50.340
<v Speaker 2>his kind of wells?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kind of knows that that's possible as</v>

2526
01:57:50.341 --> 01:57:51.174
<v Speaker 2>mainstream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether or not it happened then is up </v>

2527
01:57:53.281 --> 01:57:54.114
<v Speaker 2>for debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also the end of the ice age and he </v>

2528
01:57:55.681 --> 01:57:59.670
<v Speaker 2>thinks that's the reason why the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the all these ice caps melted.</v>

2529
01:58:00.210 --> 01:58:01.043
<v Speaker 2>This was what caused that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was part of that has a massive shift </v>

2530
01:58:03.121 --> 01:58:05.930
<v Speaker 2>in the massive shift in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2531
01:58:05.950 --> 01:58:07.110
<v Speaker 2>the global temperature.</v>

2532
01:58:07.370 --> 01:58:08.490
<v Speaker 1>She's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2533
01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:09.353
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just reading a thing about the </v>

2534
01:58:10.261 --> 01:58:12.370
<v Speaker 1>message yesterday and the Times that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2535
01:58:13.100 --> 01:58:16.670
<v Speaker 1>about how the Ice Change Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the five boroughs,</v>

2536
01:58:17.060 --> 01:58:19.310
<v Speaker 1>like that's kind of where the ice kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of came down to,</v>

2537
01:58:19.550 --> 01:58:23.760
<v Speaker 1>was around there and seeing how receded </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what it left behind we were,</v>

2538
01:58:24.590 --> 01:58:27.830
<v Speaker 1>but the civilizations weren't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>living around them.</v>

2539
01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:29.930
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean during the Ice Age?</v>

2540
01:58:30.130 --> 01:58:31.310
<v Speaker 1>Of course there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

2541
01:58:31.430 --> 01:58:32.840
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were some civilizations.</v>

2542
01:58:32.841 --> 01:58:33.674
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's established civilizations</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's some stricter Africa or </v>

2543
01:58:36.500 --> 01:58:37.333
<v Speaker 2>while there's some structures that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that have been absolutely linked to </v>

2544
01:58:40.611 --> 01:58:43.780
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A big one is go beckley tap eight,</v>

2545
01:58:43.810 --> 01:58:47.950
<v Speaker 2>which is in Turkey and they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've absolutely dated that to 12,000</v>

2546
01:58:47.951 --> 01:58:50.590
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what's fascinating about that is they</v>

2547
01:58:50.591 --> 01:58:53.920
<v Speaker 2>didn't know that people are capable of </v>
<v Speaker 2>building these gigantic stone structures</v>

2548
01:58:53.921 --> 01:58:54.754
<v Speaker 2>12,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago and they've only uncovered a </v>

2549
01:58:56.321 --> 01:58:58.230
<v Speaker 2>very small amount of gold beckley </v>
<v Speaker 2>tapping.</v>

2550
01:58:58.240 --> 01:58:59.830
<v Speaker 2>It's a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge site.</v>

2551
01:59:00.190 --> 01:59:01.023
<v Speaker 2>So do you think that there's still tons </v>
<v Speaker 2>of stuff we could discover that hasn't </v>

2552
01:59:04.241 --> 01:59:06.340
<v Speaker 2>been tapped yet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like under the oceans or.</v>

2553
01:59:06.420 --> 01:59:07.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

2554
01:59:08.170 --> 01:59:09.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if people find it,</v>

2555
01:59:09.281 --> 01:59:11.740
<v Speaker 2>if these guys are right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and here's the thing,</v>

2556
01:59:12.220 --> 01:59:16.900
<v Speaker 2>they what they think is that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>been,</v>

2557
01:59:16.930 --> 01:59:21.930
<v Speaker 2>there was a big dip and I forget what </v>
<v Speaker 2>his term that he used to describe it,</v>

2558
01:59:23.291 --> 01:59:25.210
<v Speaker 2>but it was the.</v>

2559
01:59:26.500 --> 01:59:27.333
<v Speaker 2>There was a dark age that was created by</v>
<v Speaker 2>these mass ejections and that </v>

2560
01:59:32.410 --> 01:59:33.243
<v Speaker 2>civilization particularly in Egypt had </v>
<v Speaker 2>reached a very high level of </v>

2561
01:59:36.581 --> 01:59:40.420
<v Speaker 2>sophistication when they are capable of </v>
<v Speaker 2>building these gigantic stone structures</v>

2562
01:59:40.421 --> 01:59:41.254
<v Speaker 2>and they had all this amazing </v>
<v Speaker 2>architecture and engineering or to move </v>

2563
01:59:45.431 --> 01:59:46.264
<v Speaker 2>these huge stones and then there was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>big die off and that for thousands of </v>

2564
01:59:51.940 --> 01:59:52.773
<v Speaker 2>years people essentially were knocked </v>
<v Speaker 2>back almost down into the stone age and </v>

2565
01:59:56.481 --> 02:00:00.550
<v Speaker 2>then regrouped and this is but this </v>
<v Speaker 2>cataclysmic story.</v>

2566
02:00:00.551 --> 02:00:04.720
<v Speaker 2>This story is in Noah's Ark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in the epic of Gilgamesh,</v>

2567
02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:05.673
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is where I rack is like they all </v>

2568
02:00:08.231 --> 02:00:09.064
<v Speaker 2>talk about the floods and cash in is </v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos and God punished everyone and </v>

2569
02:00:13.781 --> 02:00:16.570
<v Speaker 2>everyone died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like a part of human history,</v>

2570
02:00:17.080 --> 02:00:18.910
<v Speaker 2>many different versions of of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2571
02:00:18.970 --> 02:00:20.620
<v Speaker 2>What exactly happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2572
02:00:20.650 --> 02:00:22.960
<v Speaker 2>but he's pointing to geological </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence,</v>

2573
02:00:22.961 --> 02:00:24.970
<v Speaker 2>which is fascinating because at one </v>
<v Speaker 2>point in time,</v>

2574
02:00:25.030 --> 02:00:26.920
<v Speaker 2>nine around 9,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>BC,</v>

2575
02:00:27.370 --> 02:00:32.200
<v Speaker 2>the Nile Valley was not all sand the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>we see it now,</v>

2576
02:00:32.201 --> 02:00:36.730
<v Speaker 2>but it was a tropical rain forest and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>for thousands of years before that,</v>

2577
02:00:36.731 --> 02:00:37.564
<v Speaker 2>it was torrential downpours and rain and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this was the reason why the Sphinx </v>

2578
02:00:43.001 --> 02:00:43.834
<v Speaker 2>enclosure has these deep fissures that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are indicative of rainfall and water </v>

2579
02:00:48.161 --> 02:00:49.930
<v Speaker 2>erosion for thousands of years.</v>

2580
02:00:49.930 --> 02:00:53.050
<v Speaker 2>Not just instantaneous flooding from </v>
<v Speaker 2>some giant event,</v>

2581
02:00:53.051 --> 02:00:55.690
<v Speaker 2>but from thousands of years of rainfall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of rain,</v>

2582
02:00:55.840 --> 02:01:00.580
<v Speaker 2>just constant rate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that would predate the.</v>

2583
02:01:00.610 --> 02:01:01.443
<v Speaker 2>The idea is the current established </v>
<v Speaker 2>timeline is that the great sphinx was </v>

2584
02:01:07.090 --> 02:01:07.923
<v Speaker 2>created somewhere around the time that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they believe the great pyramids were </v>

2585
02:01:10.301 --> 02:01:12.060
<v Speaker 2>created.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the Great Pyramid of they've,</v>

2586
02:01:12.061 --> 02:01:12.894
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've,</v>

2587
02:01:13.180 --> 02:01:17.260
<v Speaker 2>they've done carbon dating that </v>
<v Speaker 2>indicates that that was somewhere around</v>

2588
02:01:17.261 --> 02:01:19.120
<v Speaker 2>2,500</v>
<v Speaker 2>BC.</v>

2589
02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:24.190
<v Speaker 2>He thinks that that was built over an </v>
<v Speaker 2>older site that was for many,</v>

2590
02:01:24.191 --> 02:01:26.290
<v Speaker 2>many years before that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he has all these photos,</v>

2591
02:01:26.700 --> 02:01:27.533
<v Speaker 2>similar construction methods that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've done where they've taken a </v>

2592
02:01:30.131 --> 02:01:30.964
<v Speaker 2>really old site from maybe many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many thousands of years ago and put </v>

2593
02:01:34.391 --> 02:01:37.810
<v Speaker 2>something over that like sort of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the analysts did build on top.</v>

2594
02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:40.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the Parthenon Necropolis,</v>

2595
02:01:40.580 --> 02:01:41.413
<v Speaker 2>they built it over the Acropolis or an </v>
<v Speaker 2>old thing that they don't even know </v>

2596
02:01:45.381 --> 02:01:49.100
<v Speaker 2>where the fuck it came from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where that old thing where it's from.</v>

2597
02:01:49.340 --> 02:01:50.173
<v Speaker 2>So the idea is that this old thing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Egypt in particular is a product of an </v>

2598
02:01:54.860 --> 02:01:56.870
<v Speaker 2>old civilization from many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

2599
02:01:56.871 --> 02:01:57.704
<v Speaker 2>many thousands of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So long ago that the distance and the </v>

2600
02:02:01.701 --> 02:02:02.534
<v Speaker 2>gap between the people who built the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pyramids and the people who originally </v>

2601
02:02:05.871 --> 02:02:10.580
<v Speaker 2>built the Sphinx is far greater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>far greater than that.</v>

2602
02:02:10.660 --> 02:02:13.220
<v Speaker 2>Our distance between us and the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who built the pyramids.</v>

2603
02:02:13.250 --> 02:02:14.290
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2604
02:02:14.870 --> 02:02:16.640
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

2605
02:02:16.670 --> 02:02:19.370
<v Speaker 2>This is how fucking crazy it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about this.</v>

2606
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:20.263
<v Speaker 2>Cleopatra is coach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's closer to the creation of the </v>

2607
02:02:24.411 --> 02:02:27.320
<v Speaker 2>iphone than she is to the creation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the pyramids.</v>

2608
02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:30.070
<v Speaker 2>That's the real deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means that yes,</v>

2609
02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:33.110
<v Speaker 2>that's established egyptologists </v>
<v Speaker 2>archeologists.</v>

2610
02:02:33.320 --> 02:02:34.660
<v Speaker 2>This is not controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2611
02:02:34.830 --> 02:02:37.210
<v Speaker 2>This is just a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She then they cool,</v>

2612
02:02:37.610 --> 02:02:38.443
<v Speaker 2>but they think that at 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 2>BC that represents only the new </v>

2613
02:02:41.901 --> 02:02:45.980
<v Speaker 2>construction in Egypt and that before </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you go to 10,000</v>

2614
02:02:45.981 --> 02:02:48.830
<v Speaker 2>BC and before there was a whole nother </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization there.</v>

2615
02:02:48.950 --> 02:02:50.480
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's amazing.</v>

2616
02:02:50.510 --> 02:02:51.231
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>

2617
02:02:51.231 --> 02:02:53.720
<v Speaker 2>And that this is when 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>plus years ago,</v>

2618
02:02:54.020 --> 02:02:58.460
<v Speaker 2>this is when these cataclysmic events </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen and all these people died off and</v>

2619
02:02:58.490 --> 02:03:02.420
<v Speaker 2>much of what they knew back then was </v>
<v Speaker 2>lost and they rebuild.</v>

2620
02:03:03.740 --> 02:03:06.250
<v Speaker 1>What's so scary about that is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2621
02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:07.633
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like it could happen any day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something can happen with the sun and </v>

2622
02:03:11.211 --> 02:03:12.044
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden we're dealing with some </v>
<v Speaker 1>other big solar flare comes at us and </v>

2623
02:03:16.520 --> 02:03:18.170
<v Speaker 1>we're in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did it say,</v>

2624
02:03:18.171 --> 02:03:20.930
<v Speaker 1>Janet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was an article in business insider</v>

2625
02:03:20.931 --> 02:03:24.380
<v Speaker 1>about coronal mass ejections hots </v>
<v Speaker 1>coronal mean.</v>

2626
02:03:24.410 --> 02:03:26.660
<v Speaker 1>Go back to that is a different thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

2627
02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:28.281
<v Speaker 1>coronal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like.</v>

2628
02:03:28.281 --> 02:03:28.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2629
02:03:28.670 --> 02:03:30.800
<v Speaker 2>What did you just say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>High speed solar winds.</v>

2630
02:03:30.801 --> 02:03:32.860
<v Speaker 2>Increase lightening strikes on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2631
02:03:32.861 --> 02:03:34.270
<v Speaker 2>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was that last one though?</v>

2632
02:03:34.570 --> 02:03:35.860
<v Speaker 2>Coronal mass ejection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it,</v>

2633
02:03:35.910 --> 02:03:36.400
<v Speaker 2>you have to</v>

2634
02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:37.680
<v Speaker 1>scribe or something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

2635
02:03:37.720 --> 02:03:40.210
<v Speaker 1>I had it up for five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all red,</v>

2636
02:03:40.211 --> 02:03:43.150
<v Speaker 1>but it was saying that like they could </v>
<v Speaker 1>put it in that article.</v>

2637
02:03:44.050 --> 02:03:46.330
<v Speaker 1>Come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me go back to it.</v>

2638
02:03:46.360 --> 02:03:48.160
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's it doing?</v>

2639
02:03:48.250 --> 02:03:49.540
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's acting weird.</v>

2640
02:03:49.541 --> 02:03:50.800
<v Speaker 1>I gotta find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's King Tut.</v>

2641
02:03:50.860 --> 02:03:54.460
<v Speaker 1>This is what happened with Indiana Jones</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he can't go back.</v>

2642
02:03:54.490 --> 02:03:55.323
<v Speaker 1>Why isn't it</v>

2643
02:03:56.700 --> 02:03:59.330
<v Speaker 2>there were shockingly unprepared for an </v>
<v Speaker 2>extreme.</v>

2644
02:03:59.390 --> 02:04:00.500
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2645
02:04:00.510 --> 02:04:01.343
<v Speaker 2>looks like you're using an ad blocker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just dissembled the ad blogger business </v>

2646
02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:06.200
<v Speaker 2>insiders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here it goes.</v>

2647
02:04:06.470 --> 02:04:07.303
<v Speaker 2>We're shockingly unprepared for an </v>
<v Speaker 2>extreme weather event that could fry </v>

2648
02:04:10.431 --> 02:04:11.690
<v Speaker 2>earth power grid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

2649
02:04:11.691 --> 02:04:13.670
<v Speaker 2>That's something that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did he say had happened?</v>

2650
02:04:13.730 --> 02:04:16.100
<v Speaker 2>What year did he say he don't want that </v>
<v Speaker 2>to happen.</v>

2651
02:04:16.101 --> 02:04:18.680
<v Speaker 2>Carrington event was 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>59 in 18.</v>

2652
02:04:18.681 --> 02:04:19.930
<v Speaker 2>50 nine event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2653
02:04:19.960 --> 02:04:23.180
<v Speaker 2>If it happened today with completely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is a documented event,</v>

2654
02:04:23.390 --> 02:04:24.890
<v Speaker 2>if it hadn't been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're like,</v>

2655
02:04:25.580 --> 02:04:27.950
<v Speaker 2>transformers blew up all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>

2656
02:04:27.951 --> 02:04:28.784
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they would do the Morse code and </v>

2657
02:04:29.721 --> 02:04:30.554
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that shit express and exploded </v>

2658
02:04:33.621 --> 02:04:37.200
<v Speaker 2>because of this coronal mass ejection or</v>
<v Speaker 2>gigantic solar flare.</v>

2659
02:04:37.201 --> 02:04:38.670
<v Speaker 2>And this is a documented</v>

2660
02:04:38.670 --> 02:04:40.810
<v Speaker 5>one and they're saying if this </v>
<v Speaker 5>documented one,</v>

2661
02:04:40.811 --> 02:04:44.070
<v Speaker 5>this Carrington event happened today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'd be fucked.</v>

2662
02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:46.280
<v Speaker 5>All the electric would puke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2663
02:04:46.650 --> 02:04:48.300
<v Speaker 5>We wouldn't have to go on twitter </v>
<v Speaker 5>anymore.</v>

2664
02:04:48.860 --> 02:04:50.280
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that would be amazing.</v>

2665
02:04:50.310 --> 02:04:51.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you will also wouldn't be able to go</v>

2666
02:04:51.871 --> 02:04:55.080
<v Speaker 5>to the grocery store and your Tesla </v>
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't work.</v>

2667
02:04:55.740 --> 02:05:00.740
<v Speaker 5>But I would get my compound bow and go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not that piece of shit in the museum.</v>

2668
02:05:07.020 --> 02:05:09.610
<v Speaker 5>That's so crazy that we've.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's crazy is that you,</v>

2669
02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:13.290
<v Speaker 5>these civilizations were able to build </v>
<v Speaker 5>up and they get knocked all the way back</v>

2670
02:05:13.350 --> 02:05:15.570
<v Speaker 5>and then build up a similar way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2671
02:05:15.571 --> 02:05:17.430
<v Speaker 5>If,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're talking about the Egypt one.</v>

2672
02:05:17.700 --> 02:05:18.481
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2673
02:05:18.481 --> 02:05:19.314
<v Speaker 5>They came back kind of in a similar way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If the Pyramids and the Sphinx are that </v>

2674
02:05:22.231 --> 02:05:23.064
<v Speaker 5>far apart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that there was something in the DNA in </v>

2675
02:05:26.471 --> 02:05:30.600
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the brain space that was that evolve.</v>

2676
02:05:30.690 --> 02:05:33.480
<v Speaker 5>They tried to come back the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was pretty interesting,</v>

2677
02:05:33.810 --> 02:05:36.660
<v Speaker 5>if not the same way in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In a similar way.</v>

2678
02:05:36.680 --> 02:05:39.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean some of the people survived.</v>

2679
02:05:39.001 --> 02:05:39.834
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And some of the people that survived </v>

2680
02:05:40.650 --> 02:05:42.780
<v Speaker 5>must've had some knowledge of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>construction.</v>

2681
02:05:42.781 --> 02:05:44.880
<v Speaker 5>They pass it down from generation to </v>
<v Speaker 5>generation,</v>

2682
02:05:44.881 --> 02:05:45.714
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're dealing with thousands and </v>

2683
02:05:47.670 --> 02:05:48.503
<v Speaker 5>thousands of years where they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 5>building things like that and then they </v>

2684
02:05:50.490 --> 02:05:52.440
<v Speaker 5>figured out a way to do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2685
02:05:52.830 --> 02:05:54.730
<v Speaker 5>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How the fuck did they be?</v>

2686
02:05:54.731 --> 02:05:55.564
<v Speaker 5>So how did they become so smart?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what's interesting because the </v>

2687
02:05:58.231 --> 02:06:02.970
<v Speaker 5>great paramedics per perhaps maybe they </v>
<v Speaker 5>just had superior genetics,</v>

2688
02:06:02.971 --> 02:06:07.530
<v Speaker 5>but it's also what they were showing in </v>
<v Speaker 5>this video that I watched it in the imax</v>

2689
02:06:07.531 --> 02:06:08.364
<v Speaker 5>thing yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was that the area was so unbelievably </v>

2690
02:06:10.801 --> 02:06:11.634
<v Speaker 5>fertile that there was so much of an </v>
<v Speaker 5>opportunity for them to grow food and </v>

2691
02:06:15.661 --> 02:06:19.650
<v Speaker 5>there were so many animals there for </v>
<v Speaker 5>them to hunt and agriculture,</v>

2692
02:06:19.950 --> 02:06:20.783
<v Speaker 5>that they had a chance to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>establish a civilization because it was </v>

2693
02:06:24.211 --> 02:06:25.044
<v Speaker 5>such a rich area with natural resources </v>
<v Speaker 5>and established civilization and that </v>

2694
02:06:28.681 --> 02:06:29.514
<v Speaker 5>civilization just kept advancing and </v>
<v Speaker 5>moving forward and that it was all </v>

2695
02:06:32.280 --> 02:06:34.950
<v Speaker 5>eventually weakened by civil turmoil.</v>

2696
02:06:35.460 --> 02:06:36.293
<v Speaker 5>That civil turmoil in the Pharaoh's lost</v>
<v Speaker 5>their power and as the Pharaoh's lost </v>

2697
02:06:39.691 --> 02:06:42.640
<v Speaker 5>their power,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then they were invaded and yeah,</v>

2698
02:06:43.170 --> 02:06:44.550
<v Speaker 5>from across the sea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2699
02:06:44.551 --> 02:06:45.384
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from inside of Africa over inside </v>

2700
02:06:46.711 --> 02:06:48.210
<v Speaker 5>Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you look at,</v>

2701
02:06:48.211 --> 02:06:48.721
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2702
02:06:48.721 --> 02:06:51.630
<v Speaker 5>the Nubians took over Egypt at one point</v>
<v Speaker 5>in time,</v>

2703
02:06:52.980 --> 02:06:54.900
<v Speaker 5>sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well different,</v>

2704
02:06:55.050 --> 02:06:56.280
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>different people in Africa.</v>

2705
02:06:56.310 --> 02:06:57.143
<v Speaker 5>We're going over there and looking at </v>
<v Speaker 5>all the shit they had and also the </v>

2706
02:06:59.011 --> 02:07:01.290
<v Speaker 5>library of Alexandria was burned by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Muslims.</v>

2707
02:07:01.291 --> 02:07:04.770
<v Speaker 5>Was it a lush area like when I picked </v>
<v Speaker 5>your Egypt I picture like a desert.</v>

2708
02:07:04.940 --> 02:07:05.773
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2709
02:07:07.130 --> 02:07:07.891
<v Speaker 5>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2710
02:07:07.891 --> 02:07:12.510
<v Speaker 5>Denial was a river right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the river where the wetlands,</v>

2711
02:07:12.511 --> 02:07:13.344
<v Speaker 5>where it's filled with the animals and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they grew food there and what they're </v>

2712
02:07:16.741 --> 02:07:21.350
<v Speaker 5>thinking by this predating of the Sphinx</v>
<v Speaker 5>with Dr Robert Schoch with his,</v>

2713
02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:26.510
<v Speaker 5>his proposal is that it was initially </v>
<v Speaker 5>created back when it was rain forest and</v>

2714
02:07:27.541 --> 02:07:30.930
<v Speaker 5>was unbelievably lush,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so incredibly fertile and then slowly as</v>

2715
02:07:30.980 --> 02:07:31.813
<v Speaker 5>the climate shifted and that climate </v>
<v Speaker 5>shift could have corresponded with that </v>

2716
02:07:36.370 --> 02:07:37.590
<v Speaker 5>coronal mass ejections.</v>

2717
02:07:37.590 --> 02:07:38.423
<v Speaker 5>So it could have been some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>massive event that's slowly or even </v>

2718
02:07:42.251 --> 02:07:46.000
<v Speaker 5>rapidly shifted the climate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would like to go over and see it.</v>

2719
02:07:46.030 --> 02:07:47.740
<v Speaker 5>I always,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a little scared to go there.</v>

2720
02:07:47.750 --> 02:07:50.050
<v Speaker 5>To me both buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2721
02:07:50.051 --> 02:07:51.850
<v Speaker 5>That would be a cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2722
02:07:51.851 --> 02:07:52.684
<v Speaker 5>where,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what else would you want to see that's </v>

2723
02:07:53.320 --> 02:07:55.870
<v Speaker 5>that profound?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's when they're walking.</v>

2724
02:07:55.871 --> 02:07:58.030
<v Speaker 5>When you watched the imax movie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't recommend enough.</v>

2725
02:07:58.031 --> 02:08:00.220
<v Speaker 5>It's quick too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you have a short attention span,</v>

2726
02:08:00.221 --> 02:08:01.450
<v Speaker 5>it's like 45 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2727
02:08:01.660 --> 02:08:02.493
<v Speaker 5>But when you watch them walk next to </v>
<v Speaker 5>these enormous statues mean these </v>

2728
02:08:08.321 --> 02:08:09.154
<v Speaker 5>fucking statues of the pharaohs are so </v>
<v Speaker 5>big that you see these little tiny </v>

2729
02:08:12.431 --> 02:08:15.040
<v Speaker 5>people walking by and you realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

2730
02:08:15.340 --> 02:08:16.173
<v Speaker 5>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These people had done something </v>

2731
02:08:18.701 --> 02:08:20.860
<v Speaker 5>unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The this,</v>

2732
02:08:20.861 --> 02:08:24.100
<v Speaker 5>the Pyramids and the Sphinx.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's so much crazy.</v>

2733
02:08:24.130 --> 02:08:26.230
<v Speaker 5>There's so much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And why just.</v>

2734
02:08:26.230 --> 02:08:29.160
<v Speaker 5>They're exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

2735
02:08:29.770 --> 02:08:31.210
<v Speaker 5>What did they figure it out?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2736
02:08:31.240 --> 02:08:32.620
<v Speaker 5>How did they.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happened?</v>

2737
02:08:33.690 --> 02:08:35.680
<v Speaker 5>Why were they the only ones at the time?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2738
02:08:35.681 --> 02:08:37.540
<v Speaker 5>it has to be connected to resources,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2739
02:08:37.541 --> 02:08:38.374
<v Speaker 5>Like because if you go today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's parts of the world where people </v>

2740
02:08:41.351 --> 02:08:42.260
<v Speaker 5>are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2741
02:08:42.280 --> 02:08:45.580
<v Speaker 5>and some impoverished parts of Africa </v>
<v Speaker 5>and particularly where they don't have a</v>

2742
02:08:45.581 --> 02:08:47.490
<v Speaker 5>lot of resources or people are fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2743
02:08:47.530 --> 02:08:48.363
<v Speaker 5>And they don't have any opportunity and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're in a terrible place and it's </v>

2744
02:08:50.531 --> 02:08:54.070
<v Speaker 5>just really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really shitty time to be alive.</v>

2745
02:08:54.130 --> 02:08:58.870
<v Speaker 5>You're not advancing at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can go to like the bay area,</v>

2746
02:08:59.270 --> 02:09:00.103
<v Speaker 5>some teasing cheese shop and right </v>
<v Speaker 5>around your electric car and you know </v>

2747
02:09:03.791 --> 02:09:06.730
<v Speaker 5>what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Seeing that on earth.</v>

2748
02:09:06.760 --> 02:09:08.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Simultaneously.</v>

2749
02:09:08.200 --> 02:09:10.450
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just purely what's available.</v>

2750
02:09:10.530 --> 02:09:11.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2751
02:09:11.591 --> 02:09:13.300
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and what minds,</v>

2752
02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:16.990
<v Speaker 5>like how many Elan Musk's did they have </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Egyptian times,</v>

2753
02:09:17.140 --> 02:09:17.350
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2754
02:09:17.350 --> 02:09:18.183
<v Speaker 5>Because it was just us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You and I were kind of dumb to be </v>

2755
02:09:21.071 --> 02:09:22.300
<v Speaker 5>honest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not that bright.</v>

2756
02:09:22.360 --> 02:09:23.193
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're not venting tunnels under the </v>

2757
02:09:25.511 --> 02:09:27.190
<v Speaker 5>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just getting by.</v>

2758
02:09:27.640 --> 02:09:30.530
<v Speaker 5>If we smoked a joint and started talking</v>
<v Speaker 5>about this is what we do,</v>

2759
02:09:31.310 --> 02:09:32.143
<v Speaker 5>we make fucking tunnels and then your </v>
<v Speaker 5>car goes into the tunnel and shoots </v>

2760
02:09:35.141 --> 02:09:37.630
<v Speaker 5>around that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fucking crazy,</v>

2761
02:09:37.631 --> 02:09:39.220
<v Speaker 5>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fucking love that idea.</v>

2762
02:09:39.430 --> 02:09:40.263
<v Speaker 5>But nobody would take it seriously and </v>
<v Speaker 5>nobody would let us dig and then we'd </v>

2763
02:09:42.221 --> 02:09:44.290
<v Speaker 5>just fall asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Forget about it.</v>

2764
02:09:45.300 --> 02:09:46.133
<v Speaker 5>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Must have been a bunch of Elon Musk's </v>

2765
02:09:48.581 --> 02:09:49.870
<v Speaker 5>back in the Egyptian.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2766
02:09:49.871 --> 02:09:53.020
<v Speaker 5>that's what's amazing is there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's like this,</v>

2767
02:09:53.190 --> 02:09:57.260
<v Speaker 5>a genius Iq where all the magic happens,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2768
02:09:57.270 --> 02:09:59.350
<v Speaker 5>like where the Einsteins live,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where the.</v>

2769
02:10:00.570 --> 02:10:01.403
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where those big leaps kind of happened </v>

2770
02:10:03.281 --> 02:10:04.114
<v Speaker 5>and everybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he can be really smart but not to that </v>

2771
02:10:06.881 --> 02:10:10.810
<v Speaker 5>level where you're actually shifting the</v>
<v Speaker 5>world,</v>

2772
02:10:11.650 --> 02:10:13.060
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and maybe that's what happened.</v>

2773
02:10:13.060 --> 02:10:15.310
<v Speaker 5>Maybe there was just one genetic freak </v>
<v Speaker 5>in me,</v>

2774
02:10:15.311 --> 02:10:18.280
<v Speaker 5>a Egyptian world that was there because </v>
<v Speaker 5>their diet and stuff,</v>

2775
02:10:18.281 --> 02:10:19.114
<v Speaker 5>they were able to survive and it could </v>
<v Speaker 5>have been a slow process too because </v>

2776
02:10:25.061 --> 02:10:25.894
<v Speaker 5>you're dealing with thousands of years </v>
<v Speaker 5>of prosperity to over thousands of </v>

2777
02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:30.640
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have many,</v>

2778
02:10:30.641 --> 02:10:31.474
<v Speaker 5>many,</v>
<v Speaker 5>many generations to think things </v>

2779
02:10:32.711 --> 02:10:33.560
<v Speaker 5>through.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I right?</v>

2780
02:10:33.740 --> 02:10:37.530
<v Speaker 5>Think about what's happened on this </v>
<v Speaker 5>continent just over 200 years,</v>

2781
02:10:37.550 --> 02:10:39.860
<v Speaker 5>just 200.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go back 200 years ago.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Nothing's here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

2783
02:10:42.350 --> 02:10:44.930
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just 200 years ago.</v>

<v Speaker 5>tunnels everywhere.</v>

2787
02:10:54.680 --> 02:10:55.513
<v Speaker 5>There's going to be so many tunnels,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so anytime you can get to the Grand </v>

<v Speaker 5>Missouri territory.</v>

2802
02:11:43.371 --> 02:11:46.310
<v Speaker 5>Michigan was on both sides of the lake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at that.</v>

2803
02:11:47.290 --> 02:11:48.123
<v Speaker 5>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2804
02:11:48.150 --> 02:11:50.480
<v Speaker 5>so Michigan is on the left and the right</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the lake.</v>

2805

<v Speaker 5>Michigan territory.</v>

2807
02:11:55.191 --> 02:11:56.900
<v Speaker 5>That's not Michigan anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's Michigan.</v>

2808
02:11:56.901 --> 02:11:57.734
<v Speaker 5>The other side is Minneapolis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Detroit and all that stuff isn't under </v>

2809
02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.360
<v Speaker 5>the upper peninsula up above Wisconsin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

2810
02:12:02.361 --> 02:12:05.540

<v Speaker 5>That's Minneapolis right here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is up there,</v>

2812
02:12:08.190 --> 02:12:10.760

2816
02:12:14.571 --> 02:12:17.300

<v Speaker 5>just hit with a solar flare.</v>

2817
02:12:17.450 --> 02:12:18.283

<v Speaker 5>Massachusetts in the colony of New </v>

2821
02:12:28.940 --> 02:12:30.640
<v Speaker 5>grabbing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but Maine was like,</v>

2822

<v Speaker 5>We might keep it.</v>

2824
02:12:34.821 --> 02:12:38.240
<v Speaker 5>We might not have realized how fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>far up their maintenance.</v>

2825
02:12:38.300 --> 02:12:40.700
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of mosquitoes up there </v>
<v Speaker 5>like Maine,</v>

2826
02:12:40.940 --> 02:12:41.773
<v Speaker 5>Massachusetts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you look at like where </v>

2827
02:12:43.251 --> 02:12:45.530
<v Speaker 5>Massachusetts is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2833
02:12:58.310 --> 02:12:59.600
<v Speaker 5>New York,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right down there.</v>

2835
02:13:03.050 --> 02:13:03.883

<v Speaker 5>So look at Massachusetts and </v>

2836
02:13:05.021 --> 02:13:07.760
<v Speaker 5>Massachusetts was two places.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See?</v>

2839
02:13:12.730 --> 02:13:15.040
<v Speaker 5>Because there's two Massachusetts then </v>
<v Speaker 5>just like there's two Michigan.</v>

<v Speaker 5>How crazy is that thing?</v>

2869
02:14:21.690 --> 02:14:22.523
<v Speaker 5>Thinking back 3000 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people are still shooting bows and </v>

2870
02:14:25.801 --> 02:14:27.290
<v Speaker 5>arrows at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2871
02:14:27.390 --> 02:14:31.080
<v Speaker 5>Three thousand years later.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just completely wide open thousand.</v>

2872
02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:32.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So why?</v>

2873
02:14:32.250 --> 02:14:33.083
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So why weren't the native Americans </v>

2874
02:14:34.651 --> 02:14:36.990
<v Speaker 5>before we got here?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Putting up those big statues?</v>

2875
02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:39.030
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they lived a very different life.</v>

2876
02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:41.910
<v Speaker 5>They lived in nomadic hunter gatherer </v>
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>

2877
02:14:42.270 --> 02:14:43.103
<v Speaker 5>They have this incredible spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 5>connection to the land and to the </v>

2878
02:14:46.591 --> 02:14:49.800
<v Speaker 5>animals that they hunted and they had a </v>
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>

2879
02:14:49.801 --> 02:14:51.870
<v Speaker 5>very fascinated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a bunch of different,</v>

2880
02:14:51.900 --> 02:14:54.080
<v Speaker 5>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>native American cultures per data,</v>

2881
02:14:54.090 --> 02:14:54.923
<v Speaker 5>very fascinating connection to the earth</v>
<v Speaker 5>and to the animals and the worship that </v>

2882
02:15:00.211 --> 02:15:01.044
<v Speaker 5>they had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the reverence they have for the animals </v>

2883
02:15:03.451 --> 02:15:04.860
<v Speaker 5>and for life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the trees.</v>

2884
02:15:04.950 --> 02:15:08.700
<v Speaker 5>It's just crazy when you think about how</v>
<v Speaker 5>people were living in Europe at the same</v>

2885
02:15:08.701 --> 02:15:09.534
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2886
02:15:10.020 --> 02:15:11.310
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

2887
02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:14.070
<v Speaker 5>Just completely a totally different </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

2888
02:15:14.760 --> 02:15:16.770
<v Speaker 5>Getting syphilis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wearing powdered wigs,</v>

2889
02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:18.830
<v Speaker 5>banging their sisters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2890
02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:22.590
<v Speaker 5>So when they showed up and had gunpowder</v>
<v Speaker 5>and all the rest of the native Americans</v>

2891
02:15:22.591 --> 02:15:23.424
<v Speaker 5>didn't stand a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's crazy to me too is how many </v>

2892
02:15:25.231 --> 02:15:30.231
<v Speaker 5>people that were Westerners,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they joined a native American tribes and</v>

2893
02:15:31.350 --> 02:15:34.080
<v Speaker 5>we're living with them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So really Kevin Costner.</v>

2894
02:15:34.230 --> 02:15:34.881
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was really.</v>

2895
02:15:34.881 --> 02:15:37.650
<v Speaker 5>It was common.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It happened and no one,</v>

2896
02:15:37.710 --> 02:15:41.530
<v Speaker 5>no one moved the other way like no one </v>
<v Speaker 5>went the opera.</v>

2897
02:15:42.030 --> 02:15:42.863
<v Speaker 5>They were forced to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>American cultures decided I am going to </v>

2898
02:15:45.450 --> 02:15:46.660
<v Speaker 5>move to the city.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2899
02:15:46.990 --> 02:15:49.020
<v Speaker 5>those are the saddest pictures of all </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

2900
02:15:49.021 --> 02:15:49.854
<v Speaker 5>When you see those native Americans put </v>
<v Speaker 5>in suits and ties and hats and standing </v>

2901
02:15:52.981 --> 02:15:53.814
<v Speaker 5>there having to take pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was pictures of hard shoes and a </v>

2902
02:15:57.181 --> 02:15:59.370
<v Speaker 5>city.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Brutal.</v>

2903
02:16:00.610 --> 02:16:01.510
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bad.</v>

2904
02:16:01.830 --> 02:16:03.240
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It must've been a really interesting.</v>

2905
02:16:03.241 --> 02:16:04.160
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're talking about your,</v>

2906
02:16:04.210 --> 02:16:05.043
<v Speaker 5>your vw,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was from 20 years after the war </v>

<v Speaker 5>shows?</v>

2909

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had those wild west shows where </v>

2910
02:16:16.711 --> 02:16:21.711
<v Speaker 5>they had men who had killed a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 5>colonists.</v>

2911
02:16:22.230 --> 02:16:23.820
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and like there's a guy,</v>

2912
02:16:23.850 --> 02:16:24.683
<v Speaker 5>I think his name was mall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was this giant Indian guy who's just </v>

2913
02:16:28.531 --> 02:16:30.160
<v Speaker 5>fucking murderer</v>

<v Speaker 4>he was.</v>

2915
02:16:33.880 --> 02:16:34.713
<v Speaker 4>They would tour with him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wild bill would tour with this guy and </v>

2916

<v Speaker 4>thing for people.</v>

2918
02:16:43.281 --> 02:16:45.450
<v Speaker 4>It was like a recreation of what it </v>
<v Speaker 4>meant.</v>

2919
02:16:45.600 --> 02:16:47.620
<v Speaker 4>What must have been like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Geez,</v>

2920
02:16:47.770 --> 02:16:51.100
<v Speaker 4>when they captured territory from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>native Americans,</v>

2921
02:16:51.120 --> 02:16:53.200
<v Speaker 4>like they do these wild west shows.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's like the movies.</v>

<v Speaker 4>hundreds.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Nobody knew about it.</v>

2928
02:17:10.421 --> 02:17:14.260

<v Speaker 4>to read a little story.</v>

<v Speaker 4>But here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man that just happened.</v>

2984
02:19:52.280 --> 02:19:56.840
<v Speaker 4>All of this just happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about 1900 9,118</v>

2985
02:19:56.841 --> 02:19:57.674
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's almost a human lifespan like this </v>

2986
02:20:00.221 --> 02:20:01.054
<v Speaker 4>is this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this convergence of human beings was so </v>

2987
02:20:03.411 --> 02:20:03.830
<v Speaker 4>recent.</v>

2988
02:20:03.830 --> 02:20:07.520
<v Speaker 4>Killed these more probably like movies </v>
<v Speaker 4>and radio people like for sure.</v>

2989
02:20:07.700 --> 02:20:11.510
<v Speaker 4>Probably looks like a movie production.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when you see each other a bunch.</v>

2990
02:20:13.070 --> 02:20:15.010
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure there was some venereal disease</v>
<v Speaker 4>involved.</v>

2991
02:20:15.030 --> 02:20:15.863
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They probably all died of fucking </v>

2992
02:20:16.860 --> 02:20:18.310
<v Speaker 4>herpes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't they?</v>

2993
02:20:18.320 --> 02:20:20.640
<v Speaker 4>They had guns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were actually shooting guns.</v>

2994
02:20:20.810 --> 02:20:24.230
<v Speaker 4>They had like competitions and shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shoot off to the last three to four hour</v>

2995
02:20:24.231 --> 02:20:25.064
<v Speaker 4>show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's why the Western was such a </v>

2996
02:20:26.781 --> 02:20:31.550
<v Speaker 4>popular movie for decades because it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>still so fresh in people's minds.</v>

2997
02:20:31.551 --> 02:20:32.384
<v Speaker 4>I mean you had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had grandparents that knew this </v>

2998
02:20:35.541 --> 02:20:38.000
<v Speaker 4>stuff right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you think about like the 19 fifties</v>

2999
02:20:38.001 --> 02:20:40.880
<v Speaker 4>western zone 100 years after the fact.</v>

3000
02:20:40.970 --> 02:20:41.803

3001
02:20:42.951 --> 02:20:44.540
<v Speaker 4>something that happened during the </v>
<v Speaker 4>depression.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Twain.</v>

3019
02:21:15.861 --> 02:21:16.694
<v Speaker 4>When was Mark Twain running around?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because he was kind of like the first </v>

3020
02:21:19.101 --> 02:21:21.710
<v Speaker 4>stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would go do these shows and he read.</v>

3021
02:21:21.750 --> 02:21:24.320
<v Speaker 4>He writes about it like it's a standup </v>
<v Speaker 4>performance.</v>

3022
02:21:25.610 --> 02:21:28.470
<v Speaker 4>When was he has around?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well they do.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3024
02:21:30.711 --> 02:21:33.320
<v Speaker 4>he was talking about things that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>work for a laugh.</v>

3025

<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hal Holbrook's touring as him.</v>

02:24:49.460 --> 02:24:52.060
<v Speaker 4>A song of the south telling the song of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the south.</v>

3101
02:24:52.061 --> 02:24:53.700
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the name of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3102
02:24:53.710 --> 02:24:55.810
<v Speaker 4>It's called Song of the south.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's it.</v>

3103
02:24:56.410 --> 02:24:58.810
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the name of it right now </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I think about it.</v>

3104
02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:01.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it was a super racist.</v>

3105
02:25:01.930 --> 02:25:02.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe it.</v>

3106
02:25:03.140 --> 02:25:08.140
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of bad stuff back then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does it give do that?</v>

3107
02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:18.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is Zippity Doo Dah.</v>

3108
02:25:18.210 --> 02:25:21.630
<v Speaker 2>They sing this in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty dude.</v>

3109
02:25:21.690 --> 02:25:21.870
<v Speaker 2>Is</v>

3110
02:25:21.870 --> 02:25:23.350
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why is this racist?</v>

3111
02:25:23.410 --> 02:25:24.243
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what they're asking is this </v>

3112
02:25:24.821 --> 02:25:27.550
<v Speaker 4>racist song of the south right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a guy singing it.</v>

3113
02:25:28.410 --> 02:25:32.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think this is the racist part.</v>

3114
02:25:32.801 --> 02:25:33.634
<v Speaker 4>I think the reason why you can get this </v>
<v Speaker 4>online is because it's not the racist </v>

3115
02:25:36.191 --> 02:25:38.890
<v Speaker 4>stuff because this is just a guy singing</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mr.</v>

3116
02:25:38.980 --> 02:25:43.090
<v Speaker 4>Blue Bird on my shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Myeloma.</v>

3117
02:25:43.760 --> 02:25:45.970
<v Speaker 4>So Song of the south.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The move.</v>

3118
02:25:45.971 --> 02:25:49.400
<v Speaker 4>See if you could find song of the south.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3119
02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:50.720
<v Speaker 4>With the clip that popped up when I </v>
<v Speaker 4>grew.</v>

3120
02:25:52.860 --> 02:25:54.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>80 one percent.</v>

3121
02:25:54.770 --> 02:25:59.770
<v Speaker 4>Like to look at rotten tomatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seven point three on the imd being.</v>

3122
02:26:00.660 --> 02:26:05.110
<v Speaker 4>So it's on imdv 1946.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3123
02:26:05.770 --> 02:26:10.770
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it wasn't Mark Twain died in 1910.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that means that he was walking around</v>

3124
02:26:11.141 --> 02:26:14.690
<v Speaker 4>as an old dude doing these performances.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3125
02:26:14.830 --> 02:26:16.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>late 18 hundreds.</v>

3126
02:26:17.140 --> 02:26:21.520
<v Speaker 4>And so maybe that was the kind of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>beginning of a standup comedy.</v>

3127
02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:22.473
<v Speaker 4>Go back to that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go back to that page you were just on </v>

3128
02:26:23.921 --> 02:26:27.940
<v Speaker 4>and that snopes article on it where they</v>
<v Speaker 4>do a fact check on the song of the south</v>

3129
02:26:28.950 --> 02:26:30.050
<v Speaker 4>to see it up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3130
02:26:30.200 --> 02:26:31.033
<v Speaker 4>I was gonna say I was going to double </v>
<v Speaker 4>check it before I wanted to see what it </v>

3131
02:26:35.550 --> 02:26:36.383
<v Speaker 4>says.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's true,</v>

3132
02:26:36.860 --> 02:26:37.980
<v Speaker 4>wasn't safe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3133
02:26:38.840 --> 02:26:40.370
<v Speaker 4>pull it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had it up.</v>

3134
02:26:41.290 --> 02:26:42.123
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>song of the south and Naacp Song of the </v>

3135
02:26:44.201 --> 02:26:49.201
<v Speaker 4>south unavailable on video in America </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of the Naacp threats status.</v>

3136
02:26:50.591 --> 02:26:53.290
<v Speaker 4>True.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3137
02:26:54.650 --> 02:26:56.740
<v Speaker 4>So it was that racist and wonder what it</v>
<v Speaker 4>was.</v>

3138
02:26:56.860 --> 02:26:59.680
<v Speaker 4>There was so much racist shit back then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Try or rabbit,</v>

3139
02:27:01.180 --> 02:27:03.640
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or Fox bear bear.</v>

3140
02:27:03.850 --> 02:27:05.470
<v Speaker 4>Why Breyer?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does that mean?</v>

3141
02:27:05.500 --> 02:27:10.500
<v Speaker 4>A briar like stuck in a Briar r dash e </v>
<v Speaker 4>are briar rabbit burrow sprayer bear.</v>

3142
02:27:14.561 --> 02:27:15.394
<v Speaker 4>So that was the idea that they're stuck </v>
<v Speaker 4>in briars the minstrel tradition of </v>

3143
02:27:17.771 --> 02:27:19.020
<v Speaker 4>uncle remus stories.</v>

3144
02:27:19.040 --> 02:27:19.873
<v Speaker 4>The major objections to the song of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>south had to do with the live action </v>

3145
02:27:22.061 --> 02:27:22.894
<v Speaker 4>portions filling been criticized for </v>
<v Speaker 4>making slavery appear pleasant and </v>

3146
02:27:27.101 --> 02:27:31.510
<v Speaker 4>pretending slavery didn't exist even </v>
<v Speaker 4>though the film that's kind of.</v>

3147
02:27:31.511 --> 02:27:34.060
<v Speaker 4>You're caught in between lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That potential what you just said,</v>

3148
02:27:34.510 --> 02:27:35.343
<v Speaker 4>even though the film,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Harris original collection of </v>

3149
02:27:37.391 --> 02:27:38.224
<v Speaker 4>stories is set after the civil war and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the abolition of slavery still is </v>

3150
02:27:42.011 --> 02:27:45.700
<v Speaker 4>folklorist Patricia rates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3151
02:27:46.570 --> 02:27:49.090
<v Speaker 4>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's kind of interesting,</v>

3152
02:27:49.091 --> 02:27:51.670
<v Speaker 4>especially when you talk about the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you talk about,</v>

3153
02:27:51.740 --> 02:27:55.870
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the huckleberry Finn Part,</v>

3154
02:27:56.110 --> 02:27:56.861
<v Speaker 4>like they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3155
02:27:56.861 --> 02:27:59.260
<v Speaker 4>take that out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then this one,</v>

3156
02:27:59.261 --> 02:28:00.094
<v Speaker 4>they're saying they had an objection to </v>
<v Speaker 4>making it seem like slavery didn't </v>

3157
02:28:01.991 --> 02:28:02.824
<v Speaker 4>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why you can't take it out of </v>

3158
02:28:04.540 --> 02:28:08.320
<v Speaker 4>huckleberry Finn because you need to </v>
<v Speaker 4>know that this existed.</v>

3159
02:28:08.321 --> 02:28:13.230
<v Speaker 4>We need to deal with it and understand </v>
<v Speaker 4>it rather than sanitize it.</v>

3160
02:28:13.270 --> 02:28:14.940
<v Speaker 4>Problem is defending it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3161
02:28:14.950 --> 02:28:17.560
<v Speaker 4>like you can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You really.</v>

3162
02:28:17.770 --> 02:28:21.620
<v Speaker 4>It's almost impossible to defend that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The use of that word</v>

3163
02:28:22.010 --> 02:28:23.840
<v Speaker 5>I'll give you wanted to defend the use </v>
<v Speaker 5>of that where you say,</v>

3164
02:28:23.841 --> 02:28:25.820
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we want to put that word back in a book.</v>

3165
02:28:25.821 --> 02:28:27.200
<v Speaker 5>People like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are you racist?</v>

3166
02:28:27.270 --> 02:28:28.670
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you can't.</v>

3167
02:28:28.710 --> 02:28:31.820
<v Speaker 5>You know that rationally this is </v>
<v Speaker 5>history.</v>

3168
02:28:31.821 --> 02:28:32.571
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3169
02:28:32.571 --> 02:28:33.620
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rational.</v>

3170
02:28:33.650 --> 02:28:34.483
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no rationality when it comes to </v>

3171
02:28:36.110 --> 02:28:36.943
<v Speaker 5>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Forbidden words as you saw from the </v>

3172
02:28:39.770 --> 02:28:40.603
<v Speaker 5>Kendrick Lamar concert.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

3173
02:28:42.190 --> 02:28:43.023
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's.</v>

3174
02:28:43.540 --> 02:28:44.373
<v Speaker 5>I wonder what Twain would say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you think that ultimately like this </v>

3175
02:28:47.691 --> 02:28:50.000
<v Speaker 5>is all going to sort itself out like </v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

3176
02:28:50.001 --> 02:28:53.210
<v Speaker 5>all this political correct craziness and</v>
<v Speaker 5>this kind of shit,</v>

3177
02:28:53.211 --> 02:28:54.044
<v Speaker 5>that this is just a little rough patch </v>
<v Speaker 5>of chaos that we get through on our way </v>

3178
02:28:57.711 --> 02:28:58.544
<v Speaker 5>to establishing a new way of </v>
<v Speaker 5>communicating with people a new way of </v>

3179
02:29:01.161 --> 02:29:03.980
<v Speaker 5>appreciating each other and that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3180
02:29:04.130 --> 02:29:07.700
<v Speaker 5>all this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even the anti white racism and anti male</v>

3181
02:29:07.701 --> 02:29:09.080
<v Speaker 5>sexism and all this stuff.</v>

3182
02:29:09.320 --> 02:29:10.570
<v Speaker 5>It's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3183
02:29:10.571 --> 02:29:14.210
<v Speaker 5>the wave going this way and then it'll </v>
<v Speaker 5>go that way and then it'll settle in the</v>

3184
02:29:14.211 --> 02:29:15.140
<v Speaker 5>amount of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

3185
02:29:15.141 --> 02:29:17.960
<v Speaker 5>and then we're learning from even these </v>
<v Speaker 5>missteps.</v>

3186
02:29:17.961 --> 02:29:18.794
<v Speaker 5>Like why can't we hate all men or </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything like that that we learned from </v>

3187
02:29:22.011 --> 02:29:24.170
<v Speaker 5>these missteps and the outrage that goes</v>
<v Speaker 5>to these missteps.</v>

3188
02:29:24.171 --> 02:29:24.980
<v Speaker 5>And we say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3189
02:29:24.980 --> 02:29:27.140
<v Speaker 5>I understand why this woman feels this </v>
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>

3190
02:29:27.290 --> 02:29:28.123
<v Speaker 5>She's probably abused by men and dealt </v>
<v Speaker 5>with asshole men and asshole bosses and </v>

3191
02:29:33.010 --> 02:29:37.910
<v Speaker 5>see these people like Harvey Weinstein </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the mainstream media that have abused</v>

3192
02:29:37.911 --> 02:29:42.911
<v Speaker 5>and violated and victimized women and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that it is going to balance itself out.</v>

3193
02:29:43.221 --> 02:29:44.054
<v Speaker 5>And the only way it goes is you have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>have outrage and then correction and </v>

3194
02:29:46.760 --> 02:29:47.593
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's the way history seems to </v>

3195
02:29:48.801 --> 02:29:50.360
<v Speaker 5>go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems like,</v>

3196
02:29:50.361 --> 02:29:51.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

3197
02:29:51.170 --> 02:29:53.060
<v Speaker 5>you would think in certain ways like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3198
02:29:53.061 --> 02:29:56.210
<v Speaker 5>we don't have to work that hard to </v>
<v Speaker 5>abolish these evils,</v>

3199
02:29:56.211 --> 02:29:58.310
<v Speaker 5>but then evil pops up again and it feels</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3200
02:29:58.311 --> 02:29:58.970
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3201
02:29:58.970 --> 02:29:59.600
<v Speaker 5>it's still here.</v>

3202
02:29:59.600 --> 02:30:01.380
<v Speaker 5>We still have to deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3203
02:30:01.700 --> 02:30:04.190
<v Speaker 5>And you just hope at the end we all end </v>
<v Speaker 5>up like Bruno Mars.</v>

3204
02:30:04.191 --> 02:30:05.024
<v Speaker 5>We all look like Bruno Mars and </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's happy because no one knows </v>

3205
02:30:07.701 --> 02:30:08.840
<v Speaker 5>who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what anybody is.</v>

3206
02:30:08.841 --> 02:30:09.674
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just having a good time and we're all a </v>

3207
02:30:10.761 --> 02:30:11.594
<v Speaker 5>little darker and not totally white,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not totally black and everybody's but </v>

3208
02:30:14.470 --> 02:30:15.800
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what about white people?</v>

3209
02:30:15.801 --> 02:30:18.950
<v Speaker 5>I like looking at white people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like people I like.</v>

3210
02:30:19.280 --> 02:30:21.950
<v Speaker 5>I like the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I liked the fact that we have variety in</v>

3211
02:30:21.951 --> 02:30:24.670
<v Speaker 5>the way people look.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like some people look like seal and,</v>

3212
02:30:24.840 --> 02:30:27.580
<v Speaker 5>and some people look like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3213

<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>

3361
02:37:08.051 --> 02:37:10.240
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to keep a band together and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they were.</v>

3362
02:37:10.241 --> 02:37:11.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were good to get high too.</v>

3363
02:37:12.010 --> 02:37:13.120
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We probably did a man,</v>

<v Speaker 4>some white bitches,</v>
<v Speaker 4>white girl,</v>

<v Speaker 4>son of a bitch came along,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucked everything up.</v>

3366
02:37:20.320 --> 02:37:21.560
<v Speaker 4>I just don't like the way he looks at </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

3367
02:37:21.561 --> 02:37:26.561
<v Speaker 4>When you saying I liked hip hop and </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff and I still do,</v>

3368
02:37:28.761 --> 02:37:29.840
<v Speaker 4>but it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3369
02:37:29.841 --> 02:37:32.130
<v Speaker 4>old white guy waves doing and find it.</v>

3370
02:37:32.150 --> 02:37:34.040

<v Speaker 4>I know it must be over.</v>

3371
02:37:34.100 --> 02:37:38.480
<v Speaker 4>Like why that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I found Kendrick,</v>

3372
02:37:38.481 --> 02:37:39.081

<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3373
02:37:39.081 --> 02:37:41.990
<v Speaker 4>so this is done right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once you find it,</v>

3374
02:37:42.010 --> 02:37:44.140
<v Speaker 4>it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>

3375
02:37:44.360 --> 02:37:47.540
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's enough to kill </v>
<v Speaker 4>Kendrick Lamar has momentum,</v>

3376
02:37:47.541 --> 02:37:50.420
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got too much momentum.</v>

3377
02:37:50.450 --> 02:37:51.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it was like,</v>

3378
02:37:51.981 --> 02:37:52.580
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

3379
02:37:52.580 --> 02:37:54.470
<v Speaker 4>I mean if it got to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3380
02:37:54.471 --> 02:37:57.020
<v Speaker 4>and I tried like I tried to listen to </v>
<v Speaker 4>music,</v>

3381
02:37:57.080 --> 02:37:57.913
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's different when you're young and it </v>

3382
02:37:58.491 --> 02:37:59.324
<v Speaker 4>just hits you and you from your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I have to like really try and find </v>

3383
02:38:02.631 --> 02:38:03.464
<v Speaker 4>music now because I have no friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go to Jamie and then I have to throw </v>

3384
02:38:07.320 --> 02:38:09.620
<v Speaker 4>it through a filter that's throw it </v>
<v Speaker 4>through A.</v>

3385
02:38:09.621 --> 02:38:11.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he wears yeezys.</v>

3386
02:38:11.990 --> 02:38:15.670
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's making it all becomes on two weeks.</v>

3387
02:38:15.880 --> 02:38:17.810
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kanya is producing nozzles,</v>

3388
02:38:17.811 --> 02:38:18.190
<v Speaker 4>new albums.</v>

3389
02:38:18.190 --> 02:38:20.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that it doesn't produce </v>
<v Speaker 4>good music,</v>

3390
02:38:20.490 --> 02:38:25.010
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying it's sneakers killer </v>
<v Speaker 4>Mike.</v>

3391
02:38:25.011 --> 02:38:29.120
<v Speaker 4>I like killer Mike Jayco A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3392
02:38:29.121 --> 02:38:30.590
<v Speaker 4>like a lot of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

3393
02:38:30.840 --> 02:38:32.570
<v Speaker 4>it's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a big range.</v>

3394
02:38:32.900 --> 02:38:36.320
<v Speaker 4>If you listen to bluegrass and hip hop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it means you're just tasting it all.</v>

3395
02:38:36.380 --> 02:38:41.380
<v Speaker 4>I feel like music is a lot like movies </v>
<v Speaker 4>in that people are constantly making new</v>

3396
02:38:42.321 --> 02:38:44.690
<v Speaker 4>stuff and you can't see it all or.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean think about movies.</v>

3398
02:38:46.700 --> 02:38:47.533

<v Speaker 4>whenever the fuck they started making </v>

3399
02:38:49.641 --> 02:38:53.810
<v Speaker 4>movies and every week they come out with</v>
<v Speaker 4>new movies.</v>

3400
02:38:53.840 --> 02:38:54.860
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one ever says,</v>

3401
02:38:54.861 --> 02:38:55.970

<v Speaker 7>ground.</v>

3435
02:40:23.060 --> 02:40:27.180

02:40:56.490 --> 02:41:01.490
<v Speaker 7>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I swear I can feel a kid.</v>

3445
02:41:06.720 --> 02:41:09.180
<v Speaker 7>She cut her head off a dead bird.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If it's crazy.</v>

3446
02:41:09.960 --> 02:41:11.940
<v Speaker 7>You got a kid with mental problems.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She says,</v>

3447
02:41:12.300 --> 02:41:15.330
<v Speaker 7>look at what demons.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She looks good.</v>

3448
02:41:15.990 --> 02:41:19.490
<v Speaker 7>Private friends.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Generations.</v>

3449
02:41:19.740 --> 02:41:20.573
<v Speaker 7>The exercise took care of me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't think I'm going to take care </v>

3450
02:41:22.921 --> 02:41:27.921
<v Speaker 7>of you when you die.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just coming up with real hard.</v>

3451
02:41:29.860 --> 02:41:34.020
<v Speaker 7>She wasn't altogether unspeakable kind.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This looks good at the end.</v>

3452
02:41:41.950 --> 02:41:46.950
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Very scary.</v>

3453
02:41:58.900 --> 02:41:59.900
<v Speaker 8>I just don't want to put any more.</v>

3454
02:42:03.920 --> 02:42:05.630
<v Speaker 4>It looks good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That looks scary.</v>

3455
02:42:05.631 --> 02:42:08.240
<v Speaker 4>I can't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why can't you see it?</v>

3456
02:42:08.241 --> 02:42:09.074
<v Speaker 4>Because I can't see anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When do you see things I'm talking </v>

3457
02:42:11.841 --> 02:42:12.890
<v Speaker 4>about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just said,</v>

3458
02:42:12.920 --> 02:42:15.680
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you ever watch stuff?</v>

3459
02:42:16.030 --> 02:42:18.800
<v Speaker 4>I'd go to the movies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When do you do that?</v>

3460
02:42:18.890 --> 02:42:23.030
<v Speaker 4>Whenever I can see you're writing books </v>
<v Speaker 4>and Bacon bread.</v>

3461
02:42:23.300 --> 02:42:25.820
<v Speaker 4>Take a couple of hours off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go to the God damn movies.</v>

3462
02:42:26.360 --> 02:42:28.790
<v Speaker 4>Writing is killing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really haven't.</v>

3463
02:42:28.970 --> 02:42:30.230
<v Speaker 4>My father said that to her the other </v>
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>

3464
02:42:30.231 --> 02:42:32.240
<v Speaker 4>Watch it on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Watch this movie on the plane.</v>

3465
02:42:32.241 --> 02:42:33.074
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't watched a movie on a plane in </v>

3466
02:42:34.101 --> 02:42:36.080
<v Speaker 4>two years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was the movie that Eddie Bravo city</v>

3467
02:42:36.081 --> 02:42:38.630
<v Speaker 4>saw for like six minutes and then he </v>
<v Speaker 4>left.</v>

3468
02:42:39.020 --> 02:42:41.570
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some not.</v>

3469
02:42:41.990 --> 02:42:43.480
<v Speaker 4>It was one of the new,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3470
02:42:43.740 --> 02:42:45.900
<v Speaker 4>was a big blockbuster movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

3471
02:42:46.070 --> 02:42:47.480
<v Speaker 4>Was it Black Panther?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3472
02:42:48.260 --> 02:42:49.550
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was the avengers.</v>

3473
02:42:50.680 --> 02:42:51.740
<v Speaker 4>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3474
02:42:51.741 --> 02:42:52.574
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3475
02:42:52.760 --> 02:42:53.870
<v Speaker 4>that new one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The uh,</v>

3476
02:42:53.900 --> 02:42:54.733
<v Speaker 4>wasn't deadpool because I think it </v>
<v Speaker 4>might've been the avengers or something </v>

3477
02:42:56.630 --> 02:42:58.530
<v Speaker 4>that new avengers one that everyone </v>
<v Speaker 4>loves,</v>

3478
02:42:58.531 --> 02:43:00.290
<v Speaker 4>but doesn't make sense that he would </v>
<v Speaker 4>have walked out of that so quick.</v>

3479
02:43:00.291 --> 02:43:02.570
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember what it was because </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone loves this will make sense.</v>

3480
02:43:02.571 --> 02:43:05.240
<v Speaker 4>Period.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got a weird taste.</v>

3481
02:43:07.290 --> 02:43:09.140
<v Speaker 4>Do you go to the movies?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How often do you go to the movies?</v>

3482
02:43:09.200 --> 02:43:11.650
<v Speaker 4>Once a month,</v>
<v Speaker 4>month,</v>

3483
02:43:11.650 --> 02:43:12.100
<v Speaker 4>month,</v>

3484

<v Speaker 5>maybe once.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3485
02:43:13.640 --> 02:43:15.970

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3486
02:43:16.090 --> 02:43:18.940
<v Speaker 5>when they come out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't really get too much of a chance.</v>

3487
02:43:19.240 --> 02:43:19.961
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>

3488
02:43:19.961 --> 02:43:24.280

<v Speaker 5>about barry seal made in America.</v>

3489
02:43:24.370 --> 02:43:25.480

<v Speaker 5>I was pretty surprised by that.</v>

3492
02:43:29.260 --> 02:43:32.080
<v Speaker 5>That's a good goddamn movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You forget how good Tom Cruise's too.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3496
02:43:37.960 --> 02:43:41.260

<v Speaker 5>He's got his own stuff,</v>

3497
02:43:41.261 --> 02:43:42.094
<v Speaker 5>but he makes good movies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but people who are out of their mind </v>

3498
02:43:44.110 --> 02:43:45.700

<v Speaker 5>A lot of times you can harness it word.</v>

3503
02:43:57.120 --> 02:43:59.860
<v Speaker 5>If you can harness it and put it into,</v>
<v Speaker 5>into something.</v>

3504
02:43:59.950 --> 02:44:00.850
<v Speaker 5>It's good movie,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Cruise comes out in a couple of weeks.</v>

3507
02:44:07.740 --> 02:44:09.160
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going to live.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I hear.</v>

3508
02:44:09.670 --> 02:44:13.710
<v Speaker 5>Go cruise gets to the end and he lives.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He does all his own stunts of shit.</v>

3509
02:44:13.750 --> 02:44:14.800
<v Speaker 5>He's going to drive that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

02:44:16.710 --> 02:44:18.280
<v Speaker 5>he just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just does that.</v>

3511
02:44:18.780 --> 02:44:21.730
<v Speaker 5>He does a lot of stunts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pretty crazy for a dude who's.</v>

3512
02:44:22.570 --> 02:44:27.190
<v Speaker 5>He think he is 53 or 54 and he's still </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing all his own stunts.</v>

3513
02:44:27.191 --> 02:44:28.420
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty bad ass.</v>

3514
02:44:29.110 --> 02:44:30.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was in a.</v>

3515
02:44:30.620 --> 02:44:35.620
<v Speaker 5>What was that Jack reacher movie though?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That one was a Turd.</v>

3516
02:44:35.990 --> 02:44:37.220
<v Speaker 5>Making another one?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3517
02:44:37.270 --> 02:44:39.460
<v Speaker 5>I think it might've been John Wick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're going to have doing a third one.</v>

3518
02:44:39.490 --> 02:44:40.840
<v Speaker 5>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Doing it right?</v>

3519
02:44:41.520 --> 02:44:42.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3520
02:44:42.650 --> 02:44:44.140
<v Speaker 5>He got killed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I repeat.</v>

3521
02:44:44.141 --> 02:44:47.170
<v Speaker 5>He was in with an awesome movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it changed the name of it.</v>

3522
02:44:47.170 --> 02:44:48.460
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's what it was </v>
<v Speaker 5>originally called,</v>

3523
02:44:48.461 --> 02:44:50.530
<v Speaker 5>but now we have to keep redoing the </v>
<v Speaker 5>scene.</v>

3524
02:44:50.920 --> 02:44:53.700
<v Speaker 5>He goes back and they ended up like </v>
<v Speaker 5>killing everyone in.</v>

3525
02:44:54.560 --> 02:44:58.540
<v Speaker 5>What's that movie?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The day after tomorrow.</v>

3526
02:44:58.610 --> 02:45:02.920
<v Speaker 5>Oh right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wasn't that used to be called killed?</v>

3527
02:45:02.921 --> 02:45:05.470
<v Speaker 5>I repeat Egypt tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Edge of tomorrow.</v>

3528
02:45:05.500 --> 02:45:08.950
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That movie was fucking bad ass.</v>

3529
02:45:08.980 --> 02:45:12.880
<v Speaker 5>That was a really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really good science fiction movie,</v>

3530
02:45:13.510 --> 02:45:15.100
<v Speaker 5>but it was one of the ones that came </v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

3531
02:45:15.101 --> 02:45:16.860
<v Speaker 5>What year did it come out?</v>
<v Speaker 5>14.</v>

3532
02:45:17.020 --> 02:45:19.660
<v Speaker 5>Two thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>14 was just a few years removed from him</v>

3533
02:45:19.661 --> 02:45:22.120
<v Speaker 5>being wacky when he did that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3534
02:45:22.150 --> 02:45:25.250
<v Speaker 5>Matt Lauer interview on the today show </v>
<v Speaker 5>where it was like,</v>

3535
02:45:25.270 --> 02:45:26.220
<v Speaker 5>you're being Glib,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Matt,</v>

3536
02:45:26.230 --> 02:45:27.063
<v Speaker 5>you're being Glib,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's talking about Brooke Shields </v>

3537
02:45:28.631 --> 02:45:31.810
<v Speaker 5>taking psychiatric medication and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>understand this.</v>

3538
02:45:31.811 --> 02:45:33.220
<v Speaker 5>I understand this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3539
02:45:33.640 --> 02:45:37.540
<v Speaker 5>Scientology is highly critical of </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychiatric meditation.</v>

3540
02:45:37.750 --> 02:45:39.900
<v Speaker 5>They prefer you stay crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't.</v>

3541
02:45:40.020 --> 02:45:41.170
<v Speaker 5>You don't know what you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>

3542
02:45:41.171 --> 02:45:42.160
<v Speaker 5>Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have you done the research?</v>

3543
02:45:42.161 --> 02:45:43.870
<v Speaker 5>I've done the research.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're Glib,</v>

3544
02:45:44.440 --> 02:45:45.273
<v Speaker 5>Glib,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but lauer didn't handle it that good </v>

3545
02:45:47.441 --> 02:45:49.150
<v Speaker 5>either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now you're supposed to go.</v>

3546
02:45:49.151 --> 02:45:49.984
<v Speaker 5>We'll explain to me the mechanism of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's happening with the psychiatric </v>

3547
02:45:53.831 --> 02:45:55.790
<v Speaker 5>drugs and what do you pose?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3548
02:45:55.870 --> 02:45:56.703
<v Speaker 5>And why do you think that you understand</v>
<v Speaker 5>the biological makeup of all these </v>

3549
02:45:59.351 --> 02:46:00.184
<v Speaker 5>different human beings and that none of </v>
<v Speaker 5>them should be taking psychiatric </v>

3550
02:46:02.921 --> 02:46:03.754
<v Speaker 5>medication now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a crazy thing to say that you're </v>

3551
02:46:05.231 --> 02:46:06.064
<v Speaker 5>smarter than all these biologists and </v>
<v Speaker 5>medical scientists and all these people </v>

3552
02:46:09.561 --> 02:46:10.340
<v Speaker 5>that have concocted</v>

3553
02:46:10.340 --> 02:46:13.370
<v Speaker 1>these SSRI and different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you done the research?</v>

3554
02:46:13.400 --> 02:46:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Have you done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you done the research or you glib making</v>

<v Speaker 1>they ever tell you that story?</v>

3557
02:46:22.370 --> 02:46:25.090
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing my first letterman.</v>

<v Speaker 1>monitoring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's running up and down the uh,</v>

3564
02:46:39.830 --> 02:46:42.670
<v Speaker 1>he's running up and down the hall where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the theaters,</v>

02:46:53.721 --> 02:46:54.554
<v Speaker 1>you're standing outside this door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to go onto the stage and he says </v>

3583
02:47:30.411 --> 02:47:34.820
<v Speaker 1>strange guy when he gets into that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm laughing.</v>

3595
02:48:15.880 --> 02:48:16.713
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a heated interview from Matt </v>

3596
02:48:18.460 --> 02:48:19.293
<v Speaker 1>Lauer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Play that.</v>

3597
02:48:20.270 --> 02:48:21.690
<v Speaker 1>It's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was coming up next.</v>

3598
02:48:21.810 --> 02:48:23.220
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's Matt,</v>

3599
02:48:23.260 --> 02:48:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a full head of hair back.</v>

3600
02:48:24.550 --> 02:48:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Then we'll get back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got all that hair.</v>

3601
02:48:26.650 --> 02:48:27.483
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand 14.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking at my handsome bastard radio </v>

3602
02:48:30.531 --> 02:48:31.364
<v Speaker 1>play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was my first exposure to this story </v>

3603
02:48:32.720 --> 02:48:33.553
<v Speaker 1>than just an alien movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The story breaks down on a lot of </v>

3604
02:48:35.821 --> 02:48:40.590
<v Speaker 1>different levels and in one to each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other already not the best father in the</v>

3605
02:48:40.591 --> 02:48:43.470
<v Speaker 1>world when we are working on the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Originally,</v>

3606
02:48:43.471 --> 02:48:44.420
<v Speaker 1>three years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steven,</v>

3607
02:48:44.430 --> 02:48:45.420
<v Speaker 1>I came up with this idea of nature</v>

3608
02:48:45.430 --> 02:48:49.420
<v Speaker 7>keen about a family.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That was a good movie.</v>

3609
02:48:50.040 --> 02:48:51.050
<v Speaker 7>I'd love to.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3610
02:48:51.100 --> 02:48:51.933
<v Speaker 7>me too.</v>

3611
02:48:53.670 --> 02:48:55.190
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to go inside?</v>

3612
02:48:55.530 --> 02:48:58.410
<v Speaker 1>Of course you do that real sense of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we're going to go.</v>

3613
02:48:59.190 --> 02:49:00.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I think it would probably be</v>

3614
02:49:00.541 --> 02:49:03.420
<v Speaker 1>like if we did get invaded to be robots </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

3615
02:49:03.480 --> 02:49:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'll be cool.</v>

3616
02:49:06.590 --> 02:49:07.423
<v Speaker 1>Play some of.</v>

3617
02:49:08.430 --> 02:49:09.263
<v Speaker 5>Before I was a scientologist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never agreed with psychiatry and then </v>

3618
02:49:11.131 --> 02:49:13.170
<v Speaker 5>when I started studying the history of </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychiatry,</v>

3619
02:49:13.171 --> 02:49:16.200
<v Speaker 5>I started realizing more and more why I </v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't agree with psychiatry.</v>

3620
02:49:16.260 --> 02:49:17.880
<v Speaker 5>And as far as the Brooke shields thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

3621
02:49:17.881 --> 02:49:20.880
<v Speaker 5>look you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand.</v>

3622
02:49:20.881 --> 02:49:25.881
<v Speaker 5>I really care about Brooke Shields.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I here is a wonderful and talented woman</v>

3623
02:49:30.340 --> 02:49:31.173
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to see her do well and I know </v>

3624
02:49:35.500 --> 02:49:40.240
<v Speaker 5>that a psychiatry is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a pseudo science,</v>

3625
02:49:40.560 --> 02:49:41.393
<v Speaker 5>but Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if she said that this particular thing </v>

3626
02:49:43.930 --> 02:49:44.763
<v Speaker 5>helped her feel better,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it was the anti depressant or </v>

3627
02:49:46.931 --> 02:49:50.590
<v Speaker 5>going to a counselor or a psychiatrist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Isn't that enough?</v>

3628
02:49:50.790 --> 02:49:51.670
<v Speaker 5>You have to understand this.</v>

3629
02:49:53.550 --> 02:49:54.383
<v Speaker 5>Here we are today where I talk out </v>
<v Speaker 5>against drugs and psychiatric abuses of </v>

3630
02:49:59.071 --> 02:49:59.904
<v Speaker 5>electric shocking people against their </v>
<v Speaker 5>will of drugging children with them not </v>

3631
02:50:04.681 --> 02:50:06.630
<v Speaker 5>knowing he's got good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>good effects of these drugs.</v>

3632
02:50:06.631 --> 02:50:09.150
<v Speaker 5>Do you know what adderall is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you know Rhydlin?</v>

3633
02:50:09.300 --> 02:50:11.430
<v Speaker 5>Do you know now that Ritalin is a street</v>
<v Speaker 5>drug?</v>

3634
02:50:12.390 --> 02:50:15.190
<v Speaker 5>Do you understand that the differences.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This was not a.</v>

3635
02:50:16.170 --> 02:50:18.940
<v Speaker 5>This wasn't against your question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm asking you a question.</v>

3636
02:50:18.941 --> 02:50:21.290
<v Speaker 5>I understand there's abuse of all of </v>
<v Speaker 5>these things.</v>

3637
02:50:21.310 --> 02:50:21.960
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see,</v>

3638
02:50:21.960 --> 02:50:22.793
<v Speaker 5>here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't know the history of </v>

3639
02:50:24.061 --> 02:50:26.120
<v Speaker 5>psychiatry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do aren't.</v>

3640
02:50:26.130 --> 02:50:30.480
<v Speaker 5>There are examples in my book shields be</v>
<v Speaker 5>an example of someone who benefited from</v>

3641
02:50:30.481 --> 02:50:33.300
<v Speaker 5>one of those drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All it does is mask the problem,</v>

3642
02:50:33.470 --> 02:50:35.400
<v Speaker 5>Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if you understand the history of it,</v>

3643
02:50:35.401 --> 02:50:38.130
<v Speaker 5>it masks the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what it does.</v>

3644
02:50:38.490 --> 02:50:39.323
<v Speaker 5>He is pretty aggressive on Lauer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Makiko not getting to that wasn't being </v>

3645
02:50:42.391 --> 02:50:42.780
<v Speaker 5>shitty.</v>

3646
02:50:42.780 --> 02:50:45.500
<v Speaker 5>He's just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's just like intense.</v>

3647
02:50:45.880 --> 02:50:47.310
<v Speaker 5>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's right about a lot of it.</v>

3648
02:50:47.311 --> 02:50:50.560
<v Speaker 5>He's definitely right about adderall and</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ritalin that some people abuse it,</v>

3649
02:50:51.180 --> 02:50:52.013
<v Speaker 5>but abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just because someone abuses it doesn't </v>

3650
02:50:56.041 --> 02:50:58.580
<v Speaker 5>mean it doesn't have uses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

3651
02:50:58.590 --> 02:50:59.790
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

3652
02:51:00.270 --> 02:51:03.930
<v Speaker 5>I've met people that are on adderall and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they see they need it.</v>

3653
02:51:04.410 --> 02:51:05.530
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if they're right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3654
02:51:05.550 --> 02:51:10.550
<v Speaker 5>but the guy who developed adderall says </v>
<v Speaker 5>that it should be for about four percent</v>

3655
02:51:11.191 --> 02:51:15.080
<v Speaker 5>of the population.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a lot like four people out of 100</v>

3656
02:51:15.210 --> 02:51:18.150
<v Speaker 5>and a room full of 100 people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Four of them are cranked out and doctors</v>

3657
02:51:18.151 --> 02:51:21.090
<v Speaker 5>are cranking it out like 30 percent </v>
<v Speaker 5>patients.</v>

3658
02:51:21.091 --> 02:51:21.840
<v Speaker 5>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3659
02:51:21.840 --> 02:51:22.673
<v Speaker 5>it's like super high that he.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The guy who made it so that it's being </v>

3660
02:51:24.931 --> 02:51:26.610
<v Speaker 5>abused a while,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure it is.</v>

3661
02:51:26.700 --> 02:51:28.320
<v Speaker 5>And amongst Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you done the research?</v>

3662
02:51:28.321 --> 02:51:29.430
<v Speaker 5>Joe?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you done the research?</v>

3663
02:51:29.430 --> 02:51:30.540
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know a lot about time about.</v>

3664
02:51:30.580 --> 02:51:32.560
<v Speaker 5>I understand this standard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand that,</v>

3665
02:51:33.360 --> 02:51:37.620
<v Speaker 5>but he's right about little kids and </v>
<v Speaker 5>Ritalin and I had a neighbor.</v>

3666
02:51:37.621 --> 02:51:39.690
<v Speaker 5>They drugged their kid up fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>Ritalin.</v>

3667
02:51:39.691 --> 02:51:41.850
<v Speaker 5>It was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was nothing wrong with the kid.</v>

3668
02:51:42.060 --> 02:51:44.470
<v Speaker 5>He just had energy and the parents were </v>
<v Speaker 5>working all the time.</v>

3669
02:51:44.500 --> 02:51:46.680
<v Speaker 5>They just didn't want to deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They put the kid on Ritalin.</v>

3670
02:51:46.740 --> 02:51:48.600
<v Speaker 5>Terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were bad parents.</v>

3671
02:51:48.630 --> 02:51:49.700
<v Speaker 5>That's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was.</v>

3672

<v Speaker 5>They zone the kid out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They got a monster shit and he was just </v>

3675
02:51:55.831 --> 02:51:56.664
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a weird little Zombie kid after </v>

3676
02:51:57.871 --> 02:51:59.290
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Man.</v>

3677
02:51:59.310 --> 02:52:00.031
<v Speaker 5>Say Hi to him.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It was.</v>

3680
02:52:02.940 --> 02:52:05.040
<v Speaker 5>We could have been an artist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It could have been something great.</v>

3681
02:52:05.070 --> 02:52:05.903
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's</v>

3682
02:52:06.030 --> 02:52:06.863
<v Speaker 4>taken away from him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You put a kid in a classroom and you </v>

3683
02:52:08.531 --> 02:52:11.530
<v Speaker 4>make them listen to boring shit all day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to do it.</v>

3684
02:52:11.531 --> 02:52:11.981
<v Speaker 4>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3685
02:52:11.981 --> 02:52:13.780
<v Speaker 4>there's something wrong with this child.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3686
02:52:14.440 --> 02:52:15.110
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3687
02:52:15.110 --> 02:52:19.060
<v Speaker 4>These kind of actually a free thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's actually gonna do some really cool.</v>

3688
02:52:19.120 --> 02:52:20.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got energy.</v>

3689
02:52:20.530 --> 02:52:22.540
<v Speaker 4>Let them figure it out and do something </v>
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>

3690
02:52:22.570 --> 02:52:23.890
<v Speaker 4>He's bouncing off the walls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3691
02:52:23.980 --> 02:52:25.340
<v Speaker 4>Let them go outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3692
02:52:25.420 --> 02:52:27.820
<v Speaker 4>because he's not turning into a robot </v>
<v Speaker 4>like the rest of the class,</v>

3693
02:52:28.090 --> 02:52:29.560
<v Speaker 4>but that's what we need.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need robots.</v>

3694
02:52:29.561 --> 02:52:32.980
<v Speaker 4>We need workers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What we can do with three d printers,</v>

3695
02:52:33.890 --> 02:52:37.570
<v Speaker 4>we can make them totally with human skin</v>
<v Speaker 4>around the outsides.</v>

3696
02:52:38.080 --> 02:52:38.913
<v Speaker 4>They're going to ship the three d </v>
<v Speaker 4>printers to Mars and have them make all </v>

3697
02:52:41.261 --> 02:52:44.050
<v Speaker 4>the stuff we need on Mars right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to ship it.</v>

3698
02:52:44.380 --> 02:52:47.620
<v Speaker 4>Do you think in our lifetime someone's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to fly to Mars and live there?</v>

3699
02:52:47.860 --> 02:52:48.970
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're looking at him.</v>

3700
02:52:52.270 --> 02:52:54.430
<v Speaker 4>I've already told my family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might not come back,</v>

3701
02:52:54.431 --> 02:52:56.920
<v Speaker 4>but I'm going to be a pioneer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Come back.</v>

3702
02:52:56.950 --> 02:52:58.240
<v Speaker 4>If you go there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not coming back.</v>

3703
02:52:58.241 --> 02:52:59.980
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Die On Mars.</v>

3704
02:53:00.040 --> 02:53:01.390
<v Speaker 4>Pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3705
02:53:01.450 --> 02:53:04.150
<v Speaker 4>you won't be able to do sets up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3706
02:53:04.151 --> 02:53:04.984
<v Speaker 4>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because by then is going to be all </v>

3707
02:53:06.011 --> 02:53:06.844
<v Speaker 4>holograms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you'll be able to like beam you into </v>

3708
02:53:08.981 --> 02:53:10.060
<v Speaker 4>a room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3709
02:53:10.120 --> 02:53:12.340
<v Speaker 4>It will be made at the comedy store </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing a late night set,</v>

3710
02:53:12.341 --> 02:53:14.800
<v Speaker 4>but ours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that good enough?</v>

3711
02:53:14.890 --> 02:53:15.890
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't.</v>

3712
02:53:16.270 --> 02:53:18.280
<v Speaker 4>For us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we won't feel a log.</v>

3713
02:53:18.340 --> 02:53:20.770
<v Speaker 4>You won't feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an analog experience.</v>

3714
02:53:20.830 --> 02:53:24.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no energy transfer yet.</v>

3715
02:53:25.040 --> 02:53:26.710
<v Speaker 4>Think someday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3716
02:53:27.040 --> 02:53:28.990
<v Speaker 4>They're going to harness your energy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It will be that good.</v>

3717
02:53:30.670 --> 02:53:32.680
<v Speaker 4>You think you'd be able to bang people </v>
<v Speaker 4>weren't there?</v>

3718
02:53:33.250 --> 02:53:34.083
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to make them with my three d </v>

3719
02:53:34.631 --> 02:53:38.980
<v Speaker 4>printer with human cells and then bang </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

3720
02:53:39.160 --> 02:53:42.500
<v Speaker 4>We're setting up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is why I made you pay.</v>

02:53:44.870 --> 02:53:45.430
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>

3722
02:53:45.430 --> 02:53:46.750
<v Speaker 4>That's an interesting question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3723
02:53:47.270 --> 02:53:48.103
<v Speaker 4>There's people that are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're considering the ethical </v>

3724
02:53:50.321 --> 02:53:51.154
<v Speaker 4>implications of making a headless person</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you would harvest your organs for </v>

3725
02:53:54.720 --> 02:53:55.553
<v Speaker 4>like say right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If Tom Papa decides I'm going to make a </v>

3726
02:53:57.431 --> 02:53:58.264
<v Speaker 4>headless Tom Papa and I'm just going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>drink like a fish and scoop the and </v>

3727
02:54:01.600 --> 02:54:05.500
<v Speaker 4>liver out of this asshole sticking into </v>
<v Speaker 4>my body.</v>

3728
02:54:06.070 --> 02:54:08.590
<v Speaker 4>It was pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was great.</v>

3729
02:54:08.591 --> 02:54:09.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It.</v>

3730
02:54:09.160 --> 02:54:11.740
<v Speaker 4>Your grandpa needs a liver and you want </v>
<v Speaker 4>to keep grandpa live,</v>

3731
02:54:11.741 --> 02:54:13.390
<v Speaker 4>harness all those parts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3732
02:54:13.810 --> 02:54:17.200
<v Speaker 4>but what are the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the ethical considerations?</v>

3733
02:54:17.560 --> 02:54:19.900
<v Speaker 4>Someone just told me that there's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you need a part,</v>

3734
02:54:19.930 --> 02:54:24.490
<v Speaker 4>if you need an organ or something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go to the states that have no helmet</v>

3735
02:54:24.491 --> 02:54:26.220
<v Speaker 4>laws.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>

3736
02:54:26.890 --> 02:54:30.460
<v Speaker 4>How crazy is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just in Chicago.</v>

3737
02:54:30.670 --> 02:54:32.740
<v Speaker 4>Chicago doesn't have helmet laws.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>

3738
02:54:32.760 --> 02:54:34.450
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Watch these people running the highway,</v>

3739
02:54:35.680 --> 02:54:36.513
<v Speaker 4>but you know when it goes to your liver </v>
<v Speaker 4>at home and then in Chicago they don't </v>

3740
02:54:39.701 --> 02:54:40.534
<v Speaker 4>have helmet laws but they can't split </v>
<v Speaker 4>lanes right at home and these fucking </v>

3741
02:54:44.651 --> 02:54:49.330
<v Speaker 4>guys are just driving right next to cars</v>
<v Speaker 4>whizzing in between lanes and I'm like,</v>

3742
02:54:49.660 --> 02:54:51.040
<v Speaker 4>what's more dangerous?</v>

3743
02:54:51.190 --> 02:54:54.760
<v Speaker 4>Is splitting lanes more dangerous or is </v>
<v Speaker 4>it riding around with no helmet?</v>

3744
02:54:55.100 --> 02:54:56.590
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Scary though.</v>

<v Speaker 4>They liked knowing that the door is </v>

<v Speaker 4>there and he loves them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3788
02:56:50.460 --> 02:56:52.010
<v Speaker 4>That's the whole key.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're stupid.</v>

3789
02:56:52.670 --> 02:56:54.530
<v Speaker 4>Don't you love making your kids laugh?</v>

<v Speaker 4>it's the best fun.</v>

3791
02:56:55.910 --> 02:56:57.530
<v Speaker 4>A lot of dads can't make their kids </v>
<v Speaker 4>laugh.</v>

3792
02:56:57.890 --> 02:56:59.000
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

02:56:59.270 --> 02:57:00.103
<v Speaker 4>They can make them laugh in a goofy way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you can make them laugh in a </v>

3794
02:57:01.911 --> 02:57:04.880
<v Speaker 4>way that you know is really funny.</v>

<v Speaker 4>They'll have to mark the fact that I'm </v>

<v Speaker 4>bald.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know they mock that.</v>

<v Speaker 4>spread this out and touch that and edit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want that.</v>

3837
02:58:42.571 --> 02:58:44.100

<v Speaker 4>bottom.</v>

3838

3861
02:59:45.390 --> 02:59:46.980
<v Speaker 4>bitter end?</v>
<v Speaker 4>To the end?</v>

3862
02:59:48.030 --> 02:59:48.863
<v Speaker 4>There's no part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I hear people say that they're </v>

3863
02:59:50.761 --> 02:59:53.760
<v Speaker 4>going to retire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like anybody just in the world and say,</v>

3864
02:59:53.810 --> 02:59:56.490
<v Speaker 4>I here retirement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that's one thing.</v>

3865
02:59:56.491 --> 02:59:59.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm not doing bright.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no why.</v>

3866
03:00:00.050 --> 03:00:02.550
<v Speaker 4>Why would you retire?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to make stuff until I go.</v>

3867
03:00:03.180 --> 03:00:06.990
<v Speaker 4>I want to put out stuff and see what </v>
<v Speaker 4>that stuff will be later on.</v>

3868
03:00:07.020 --> 03:00:08.250
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3869
03:00:08.251 --> 03:00:09.084
<v Speaker 4>it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've chosen a path that it's just </v>

3870
03:00:11.250 --> 03:00:14.190
<v Speaker 4>perfect for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You actually,</v>

3871
03:00:14.430 --> 03:00:16.410
<v Speaker 4>you're not working because you have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>go to work.</v>

3872
03:00:16.470 --> 03:00:18.840
<v Speaker 4>You're working because you enjoy what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you do,</v>

3873
03:00:19.140 --> 03:00:23.610
<v Speaker 4>which is really what I encourage </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone to try to attempt to do this,</v>

3874
03:00:23.611 --> 03:00:24.444
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this thing that we're taught in school </v>

3875
03:00:26.581 --> 03:00:29.460
<v Speaker 4>to try to find a good job that pays </v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

3876
03:00:29.550 --> 03:00:32.700
<v Speaker 4>That's wonderful advice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not the best advice.</v>

3877
03:00:33.120 --> 03:00:33.953
<v Speaker 4>The best advice is try to find the thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you love to do because if you can </v>

3878
03:00:37.921 --> 03:00:38.754
<v Speaker 4>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you never have that feeling that </v>

3879
03:00:41.371 --> 03:00:44.610
<v Speaker 4>most people have when it comes to work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most people have that feeling like,</v>

3880
03:00:44.700 --> 03:00:46.290
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got to go to work.</v>

3881
03:00:46.291 --> 03:00:47.730
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You never had that.</v>

3882
03:00:47.760 --> 03:00:50.010
<v Speaker 4>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's also,</v>

3883
03:00:50.220 --> 03:00:51.053
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3884
03:00:51.300 --> 03:00:54.270
<v Speaker 4>there's some luck involved in that for </v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

3885
03:00:54.690 --> 03:00:59.690
<v Speaker 4>There's also decisions you make if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have that luck to try to make that</v>

3886
03:00:59.711 --> 03:01:00.544
<v Speaker 4>luck happen.</v>

3887
03:01:00.580 --> 03:01:01.301
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3888
03:01:01.301 --> 03:01:03.340
<v Speaker 4>and then there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>talent is also like,</v>

3889
03:01:03.341 --> 03:01:06.520
<v Speaker 4>some people want to be a comedian and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they really would never will be.</v>

3890
03:01:06.750 --> 03:01:07.583
<v Speaker 4>You just can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think being self aware of what you </v>

3891
03:01:10.031 --> 03:01:12.940
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really want to do as the person,</v>

3892
03:01:13.750 --> 03:01:15.640
<v Speaker 4>not thinking of it even in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 4>work,</v>

3893
03:01:15.641 --> 03:01:16.474
<v Speaker 4>just but being looking at yourself </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough to know what you're good at and </v>

3894
03:01:20.771 --> 03:01:22.450
<v Speaker 4>what you enjoy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

3895
03:01:22.900 --> 03:01:25.720
<v Speaker 4>and then follow that path.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether it makes business sense or not,</v>

3896
03:01:26.140 --> 03:01:30.280
<v Speaker 4>that's the best thing you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know where it's going to leave</v>

3897
03:01:30.281 --> 03:01:31.870
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At least you're heading in the direction</v>

3898
03:01:31.871 --> 03:01:35.920
<v Speaker 4>where it's stuff you like and it's stuff</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know you have an aptitude for,</v>

3899
03:01:36.220 --> 03:01:40.450
<v Speaker 4>so wherever you end up in that area will</v>
<v Speaker 4>be pretty close to happiness.</v>

3900
03:01:41.110 --> 03:01:43.570
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>words of wisdom from Tom,</v>

3901
03:01:43.571 --> 03:01:44.800
<v Speaker 4>Papa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>author,</v>

3902
03:01:45.610 --> 03:01:48.130
<v Speaker 4>your dad stole my rake available.</v>

3903
03:01:48.130 --> 03:01:49.330
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it an audio version?</v>

3904
03:01:49.420 --> 03:01:52.540
<v Speaker 4>There's an audio version too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you use your voice?</v>

3905
03:01:52.630 --> 03:01:55.210
<v Speaker 4>Nine hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nine hours in a big God.</v>

3906
03:01:55.211 --> 03:01:57.320
<v Speaker 4>You did though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Reading my book some for.</v>

3907
03:01:57.370 --> 03:02:00.700
<v Speaker 4>I read a lot of books on tape or I have </v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of books written read.</v>

3908
03:02:00.701 --> 03:02:01.534
<v Speaker 4>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the real problem is when you know that </v>

3909
03:02:03.521 --> 03:02:04.354
<v Speaker 4>it's not the author and you hear someone</v>
<v Speaker 4>have some sort of bullshit halfass </v>

3910
03:02:08.020 --> 03:02:11.160
<v Speaker 4>connection to the words they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now I know I'm good.</v>

3911
03:02:11.380 --> 03:02:15.150
<v Speaker 4>That's why it was hard to do actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's nine hours of reading me.</v>

3912
03:02:15.170 --> 03:02:19.420
<v Speaker 4>I've got to read a whole book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also I have to be me behind it.</v>

3913
03:02:19.421 --> 03:02:20.254
<v Speaker 4>I got I wanna you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't want me doing a phone </v>

3914
03:02:22.091 --> 03:02:22.924
<v Speaker 4>inversion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many hours at a time did you do </v>

3915
03:02:24.401 --> 03:02:25.750
<v Speaker 4>these sessions?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Broken into two,</v>

3916
03:02:25.900 --> 03:02:27.520
<v Speaker 4>so like four and a half each day.</v>

3917
03:02:27.780 --> 03:02:29.200
<v Speaker 4>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to do,</v>

3918
03:02:29.340 --> 03:02:30.173
<v Speaker 4>to stay on point for that long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a thing like when you get out of </v>

3919
03:02:32.621 --> 03:02:33.550
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
