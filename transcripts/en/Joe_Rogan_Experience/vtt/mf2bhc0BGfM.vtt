WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.550
Are we all captivity in Ontario.
That's beautiful.

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.250
We live [inaudible].
I just got a tweet from filled the,

3
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.720
that dude is on the the trainer Wallace training.

4
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.720
They banned a killer whale captivity in Ontario.

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.200
Rich Vos doesn't give a fuck about that though.
Do you read your blogs at all?

6
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.590
One of my biggest missions in life is the killer where they kill the kill.

7
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.780
I just too much feedback.
I'm trying to get this feedback like it's,

8
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.770
there's like a humming Jimi Hendrix,
Wah Wah Wah Wah.
Is there a hum like it?

9
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.970
How do I turn it down?
It's a,
there's an obs,
right?
Is there a house?
Not a hummer.

10
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.610
I lie because I fucked up so I wanted to make it look like there was a reason I

11
00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:48.890
fucked up.
Where do you turn it down and whatnot?
This right here.

12
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.050
Oh boy.

13
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.590
You guys that talk to [inaudible] testing one,

14
00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:59.550
two there.
Oh my God.
That's too loud.
Yeah.
It's a little weird.

15
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.160
No in between that.
Okay.
It's like a fucking good right there.

16
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.010
Now it's sucked.
I'm like a Prima Donna when it comes to salmon.

17
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.080
I to tell you the truth.
I hate wearing headphones.
Don't do you.

18
00:01:11.081 --> 00:01:13.940
You don't have to wear them.
I don't know.
Take them off.
I liked,

19
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.240
I liked their little ones.
Uh,
perfect.

20
00:01:18.241 --> 00:01:23.220
It is sounds like a whole new Mac and cheese.
I just do this.
We'll let Jamie,

21
00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:26.510
we handle everything.
I have.
Shit gets weird.
Let us know.
No,
I,

22
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.520
you're going to go crazy and stick with the headphones.
Like the headphones.

23
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.950
He's gangster.
Look at him over there.
He periscoping this live your life.

24
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.630
Did you go back to the little phone?

25
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.580
<v 1>Oh,
that's the snow I'm using the Samsung Edge.
Oh,
very nice.
Nice.</v>

26
00:01:40.581 --> 00:01:43.210
And actually works very well.
I'm very happy with it.
It's great

27
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.380
<v 0>deaf phone.
It's a very sweet phone.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I got it for the Ting.
I got a um,</v>

28
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.810
um,
a GSM card.

29
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.680
<v 1>Yeah,
that's what I did.
Unlocked phone and uh,
it,
it's cool.</v>

30
00:01:53.681 --> 00:01:56.210
That camera's so amazing compared to it.
Uh,

31
00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.110
and if you compare that like the iPhone six with it,

32
00:01:59.111 --> 00:02:01.720
it's like night and day difference.
How much better they though the local mall.

33
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.560
Yeah,
the cameras.
Yeah.

34
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.430
<v 0>I'm a big fan of that Samsung phone.
They make us flip phone,
that new one,</v>

35
00:02:06.431 --> 00:02:07.420
the new galaxy,

36
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.590
the s six and the s six edge or there's so the quality is so much better than

37
00:02:11.591 --> 00:02:16.170
the five,
but I really wish they didn't have to go with the um,
the,

38
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.530
now it's not waterproof anymore and you don't have replaceable media storage.

39
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.300
<v 1>She can't,
you know what's really good battery out,</v>

40
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.510
you know it's really good though is this one I was completely dead and it has

41
00:02:25.511 --> 00:02:28.500
such a fast charge on it in my car in like 30 minutes,

42
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.440
it charged up to 56% of the battery and like 30 minutes.

43
00:02:32.441 --> 00:02:34.980
It was almost completely,
it's great.

44
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.960
<v 0>I liked them,
I liked them.
Or you anti-technology ritual.
I got this,</v>

45
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.370
the iPhone six plus cause I wanted to make my little hand even look smaller when

46
00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:44.204
I hold it.

47
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.900
I can't tell you how many times I lay in bed trying to play scrabble and it

48
00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:52.170
falls out of my fucking around and it's just the most aggravating thing on the

49
00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:54.560
planet.
But I'm,
you know,
I,
what do I use it for?

50
00:02:54.561 --> 00:02:57.530
I take some pictures and uh,

51
00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.710
maybe I'll record something.

52
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.060
<v 2>Internet,
uh,
Twitter and you went on was do I need a fucking phone for,</v>

53
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.710
you know,
I mean,
what,
what recording.
That's it.

54
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.250
You know your videos I take of my kids and that's it.
You know,

55
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.650
so the cameras and these new phones are fucking incredible.

56
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:17.980
The people that make cameras mostly so bummed out because they used to think

57
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:20.410
those little point and click cameras that everybody used to have that market

58
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.700
buys those nights.
I started a lady the other day,
took a pitch.
Not only that,

59
00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:27.640
how about the people that buy do ones that are disposable?

60
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.100
How white trash are you that you don't,

61
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.750
that you're buying a disposable fucking camera,

62
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.430
bring it somewhere and get it to develop.
Yeah.
You got to stick this,

63
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.390
these pictures are great.
Cause then I'll send this to my iPad,
to my,
uh,

64
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.320
to my Mac book and I'll send them all,
you know,
it's fucking,

65
00:03:44.321 --> 00:03:48.580
I don't even send them,
I put it right next to it and it,
it downloads to,
to,

66
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.210
to my iPad.
Did you ever see that Robin Williams movie?
24 hour photo.

67
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.000
It's one of my favorite movies.
It's great movie.
Yeah.
Amazing.

68
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.970
But today you'd be like,
why would you go quit?
Doesn't make any sense.

69
00:03:57.971 --> 00:04:01.350
Why would you like to get developed?
And you have a printer equity.

70
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.320
I have films that long.
Do you have any film that you haven't developed?

71
00:04:04.321 --> 00:04:09.130
Like I just found a camera that when I was 20 I met a girl on AOL or she lived

72
00:04:09.131 --> 00:04:12.170
in Chicago.
My Mom's like,
I'm going to Chicago.
And it was 20 years ago.

73
00:04:12.171 --> 00:04:15.690
It was like the first girl I ever met on AOL.
It was [inaudible] 95 something.

74
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.290
It will one or two and I met her own thing and we used to go back and forth and

75
00:04:20.291 --> 00:04:22.300
my mom's like,
I'm going to Chicago for work.
And I'm like,
hey,

76
00:04:22.301 --> 00:04:26.500
that girl lives in Chicago.
So I met her and we spent a day together in Chicago.

77
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.500
Don't remember what she looked like,
but the text you sent me,

78
00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:31.780
someones trolling you obviously.
Oh yeah.
I found out.

79
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.620
Of course he thought it was funny to say that he was so solid.
Well,

80
00:04:35.621 --> 00:04:40.260
you'd have to be,
you would have to been like 16,
17,
17.
But I was looking at,

81
00:04:40.261 --> 00:04:42.780
and there was one girl that I had sex with,

82
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.400
I don't remember who she was and they couldn't be there.
Uh,

83
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.110
just tell him,
send me the pictures of me.
Well,
he said it was Asian.
I was like,

84
00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:54.550
Oh,
I had my first Asian a couple of years ago.
The worst is when you macro,
like,

85
00:04:54.551 --> 00:04:59.551
I met this girl once and she was hot and I flew to Florida a couple of days to

86
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:03.400
have sex,
you know,
and then like all of a sudden she,

87
00:05:03.401 --> 00:05:06.820
I'm going out to lunch with her and our mother,
like,
what the fuck?

88
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.990
She's probably,
she's a stripper.
She's pure dysfunction.

89
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.510
And we go to hotel.

90
00:05:13.511 --> 00:05:16.990
All of a sudden I fucking right when I bust a fucking nut,

91
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.420
all I think is how am I going to get out of this whole situation?
I mean,

92
00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:27.421
I'm talking another day and a half of this fucking horribleness and he was hot,

93
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.160
but it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

94
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.840
It matters enough to get you into the mess.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

95
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.920
Well it's like,
it's like anything,

96
00:05:36.921 --> 00:05:39.580
like when you're comping and fucking free base or crack,

97
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.140
the whole excitement is going up there and getting through to guns and you know,

98
00:05:44.141 --> 00:05:47.230
dealing with,
you know,
and not fucking,
you know what I mean?
And then you get,

99
00:05:47.231 --> 00:05:51.170
it's like you get to home and boom.
Now I got it.
I made it through,
you know,

100
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.700
the minefields.
I got to fucking crack.
I smoked it all right.

101
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.020
But the whole excitement leading up to it,
you know,
uh,

102
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.950
the best thing that ever happened to me with these fucking broads,

103
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.930
when I'd pick him up and take him back to my place,
uh,
and my shitty apartment,

104
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.410
I,
they,
they can never stay.
I said,
listen,

105
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.720
you got to leave because my ex wife drops my kids off in the morning and I can't

106
00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:16.250
have my kids see and you know,

107
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.130
you okay and you're stretched out of one of my ex wife seen you knowing that I

108
00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:24.620
went from her to you.
You know what I'm saying?

109
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.800
So Larry is getting them out is,
you know,

110
00:06:27.801 --> 00:06:31.550
when you talk about traveling and getting lazy,
it's amazing the difference.

111
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.670
And I don't even know if women,
I don't think they have this experience,

112
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.330
the difference in perspective of before you have sex with them and then after

113
00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:40.940
you have sex with him,
it's so radically different.

114
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.790
Like before you have sex with them,
you can't wait.

115
00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:47.760
You like looking at her ass and look at her waist and her tits.
You like,

116
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.890
oh this is going to be a man.
And then when he'd done it like,
Oh God,

117
00:06:51.891 --> 00:06:53.000
what am I doing?

118
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.530
That's the difference between being with a girl you really do care about and

119
00:06:57.531 --> 00:07:01.220
being with a girl that your body just tricked you.
You know?

120
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.860
And that can happen to a guy and that's why,
you know,

121
00:07:03.861 --> 00:07:06.740
like if you have sex with a girl and then afterwards you're hanging out and

122
00:07:06.741 --> 00:07:11.540
talking and cuddling and you love it,
you're like,
oh,
she's really nice.

123
00:07:11.541 --> 00:07:14.060
I really like her.
I didn't get tricked this time.

124
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.990
It's like you don't even know until the fog clears.
I go,
Oh,
where are we?

125
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.400
Oh,
hello.
Hi.
It's so weird how instant it is.

126
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.570
Immediately showed disgust on you could be with a girl and,

127
00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:30.500
and everything's great like say,
and then all of a sudden the way,

128
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:35.930
uh,
she throws a piece of garbage in the wastebasket and your room,

129
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.490
you go,
I hate her.

130
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.860
Just one little Taylor.
I wish with this girl,
I'm telling you,
I get,

131
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.790
it was right after my first divorce.

132
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.580
I was working South Carolina and I met this girl.

133
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.550
You couldn't have been any better looking smart,

134
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:57.560
a great career newscaster show in South Carolina.

135
00:07:57.561 --> 00:08:02.150
We're fooling around.
It was great.
I'm like,
did I really find love again?

136
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:07.180
Right.
You know what I mean?
I was like,
ah,
she's beautiful.
Fun to be with.
Uh,

137
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.610
he came to Alabama where I was working,
I guess,
whatever.

138
00:08:10.611 --> 00:08:15.611
It wasn't far and we great weekend denim in Florida and she flies down to see me

139
00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:22.490
and,
and we're laying in bed and I'm really sick.

140
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:27.350
I have a fever.
And she goes to touching me,
go to what can I do?
And I go,

141
00:08:27.351 --> 00:08:31.740
well,
the first thing is get your fucking arm off me.
I like the AG said,

142
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.070
but don't talk to me.
And then I knew,

143
00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:39.220
I knew like you have to get outta here and I can't,

144
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.590
I can't hand,
I cannot,
I can't do this.

145
00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:47.910
And it was perfect because I'm so fucking damage in life that I'm going to

146
00:08:51.381 --> 00:08:53.630
destroy everything around.
You know what I mean?

147
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:57.900
When you have that damage personality and that,
you know,

148
00:08:57.901 --> 00:09:00.300
the whole I'm not good enough,

149
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:03.230
I'm not where you somehow you're going to fuck it up.
You know?

150
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.800
That's what's great about Bonnie.
She's his damage as I am.
It's like,
you know,

151
00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:12.780
she really,
really
loved me.
Tell you something.

152
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:17.210
Let me tell you a story.
Okay.
And we told on our rage,

153
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.540
she grew up on a fucking farm.
Okay.
When she,

154
00:09:21.541 --> 00:09:26.370
I guess 11 or 10 she had to have a major operation,

155
00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:30.900
you know,
something removed from down down here.
I don't know what it was.

156
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:34.680
It was God,
I wish,
I wish you still had one of them.

157
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:38.010
So she had to have it removed.
Right.

158
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:43.940
11 years old and she lived in Cold Lake and her parents put her on a bus to go

159
00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:53.910
have the operation and like Toronto or wherever,
10 or 11 years old,

160
00:09:53.911 --> 00:09:58.911
maybe nine by herself because her parents couldn't leave because it was harvest

161
00:09:59.011 --> 00:10:00.750
season and there were farmers,

162
00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:06.020
they put a nine or 10 year old girl on the bus to go have him go have part of

163
00:10:06.631 --> 00:10:10.980
her body taken out.
Oh my God,
in the hospital,
you know,

164
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.720
and then come home.
You know what I mean?

165
00:10:12.721 --> 00:10:14.850
I think maybe they visited her at one point,

166
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:20.540
but she grew up poor and the beginning sleeping on dirt floors,

167
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.850
you know,
and then,
uh,
you know,

168
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:29.240
farmers and killing chickens and this and that and you know,

169
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:34.170
but she was always creative.
Brilliant.
Fucking,
I read one of her books,

170
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:38.940
she made us a kid called a chicken island.
You know,
she wrote a book as a kid,

171
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.430
just brilliant,
brilliant.
And that's how my kid is.
And,
and,

172
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:47.580
and then if you don't think she's damaged,
she went out with Mark Cohen,

173
00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:52.260
who's a guitar act.
How can you not fucking nothing against a guy.

174
00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:57.110
Good songs.
Uh,
he's a comic and a female,

175
00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:02.250
whatever.
That Guy,
Huh?
I don't know.
He was married,
had kids and his wife

176
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:08.730
did some cancer stuff or whatever.
And I always got along with him.

177
00:11:08.731 --> 00:11:12.390
He was a good guy.
He was a nice guy.
He was a great guy.
Everybody liked him.

178
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:16.530
He was a great guy.
He was funny.
I don't think so.

179
00:11:16.531 --> 00:11:20.430
He's probably just doing whatever,
you know,
just never hear his name anymore.

180
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:21.930
And sometimes that happens,
you know,

181
00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:25.410
you look around the guy all the time and then for whatever reason you don't hear

182
00:11:25.411 --> 00:11:26.191
that name anymore.

183
00:11:26.191 --> 00:11:31.191
They just stop exchanging circles or circles.

184
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.260
Stop interacting with each other.
There was this guy,
Anthony,

185
00:11:34.261 --> 00:11:36.240
I knew when you would always hear his name,

186
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:41.420
Anthony Cooma and whom you whom you know and you don't hear his name anymore.

187
00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:47.250
He's still preaching to the converted.
He said,
how many,

188
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:52.140
do you know how many podcast subscribers he has?
Cause he's subscription only.

189
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:53.980
Yeah.
Which I

190
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.060
<v 3>think I'm 22,
22 people now he's doing,</v>

191
00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.310
I think he's doing our right.
I think he's done all right.

192
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:02.650
He charges like five bucks a month or something and they have no,

193
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.150
I think he's doing,
I've done this pocket.

194
00:12:04.151 --> 00:12:05.550
It was a lot of fun when I went out again,

195
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:08.890
if he was in New York and they are sending up in New York,

196
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:13.530
then it'd be like he needs to move to add based though.
If he moves to add based,

197
00:12:13.531 --> 00:12:17.650
he'll be fucking huge.
He's really good.
He's funny.
He's a funny fucking guy.

198
00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:20.440
Not only show,
he's very smart,
he's politically smart,

199
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:25.900
knows politics.
He knows what's going on,
but people are not going to pay.

200
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:28.900
They're not paying to subscribe to things,

201
00:12:28.901 --> 00:12:31.000
especially when you can for the same amount.

202
00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:34.330
You can get all the channels on Sirius,
all of them.

203
00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.210
How many do shows do you do a week?

204
00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:41.800
You do like three a week for do you do for a week?
April.
Which $5 a month?

205
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.740
I mean really if you think about enemy,
it's not that much,

206
00:12:44.741 --> 00:12:48.340
but it's actually broke and you have to make,
make your decisions.
You know,

207
00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:49.870
there's a lot of people that are broke.

208
00:12:49.871 --> 00:12:53.200
Like that's a lot of people don't like serious for that very reason because they

209
00:12:53.201 --> 00:12:55.120
have to,
they have to think,
okay,

210
00:12:55.121 --> 00:12:57.850
that's another five bucks and then this is another five bucks and that's,

211
00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:01.900
it all adds up if you're,
if you're chipping away,
that all adds up.

212
00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:05.170
<v 1>I see so much free content nowadays.
Even with periscope,</v>

213
00:13:05.171 --> 00:13:09.220
I was just watching Burt Christ or the other day for like an hour and you know,

214
00:13:09.221 --> 00:13:12.730
that's all free and that was just like a podcast,
but it was live.

215
00:13:12.731 --> 00:13:15.400
And Joey does mean around the morning joint.
Joey Diaz,

216
00:13:15.401 --> 00:13:18.070
every morning gets up at seven o'clock he lets everybody know,

217
00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:21.550
like gives you a 10 minute warning on Twitter and at seven o'clock you'd like to

218
00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:24.790
join.
It's just talking shit.
And he talks shed for like five minutes.

219
00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.530
And then he says,
all right,
go wash your pussy.
I have a good day.

220
00:13:27.531 --> 00:13:29.800
You motherfuckers gonna kill it,
kill it out there.

221
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.790
And he gives you like a little motivational

222
00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:36.820
<v 3>beach.
But I,
I think that that kind of shit is the future,</v>

223
00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:39.840
you know?
And he's going to get ads for periscope.
That's what he's going to do.

224
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.720
That's how he's going to handle it.
Yeah.
That's the future.
Yeah.
I mean,
look,

225
00:13:43.721 --> 00:13:46.090
Anthony,
I hope you don't all set financially.

226
00:13:46.091 --> 00:13:48.130
I don't know how long it's going to last.
I don't know how,

227
00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:52.000
you know they did pretty well.
You know his house.
Have you been to his house?
No,

228
00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:56.290
I've seen pictures of it.
It looks like Victoria.
God,
he used to live there.

229
00:13:56.291 --> 00:14:00.610
It's fucking beautiful.
You know,
it's real,
you know,
fucking statues pouring,

230
00:14:00.611 --> 00:14:04.810
whatever,
you know,
it's kind of fucking money.
I'm serious.
Serious game.

231
00:14:04.811 --> 00:14:08.050
A ton of money.
Yeah.
You know,
he was done with them forever.
Those guys,

232
00:14:08.051 --> 00:14:10.450
they were with any wn serious,
you know.

233
00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:14.020
So did series want to get rid of them cause they were paying so much money.

234
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.380
I doubt I take now.
Now.
Yeah,

235
00:14:17.381 --> 00:14:21.970
because our corporate and once you say you would take it was all of her money.

236
00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.580
<v 1>Oh I think that there's a lot of money problems over at that place.</v>

237
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:28.700
They're trying to get you the article about them cutting Howard Stern's money.

238
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:32.480
I think they're cutting the fat is pretty much what they're probably thinking

239
00:14:32.481 --> 00:14:36.950
about right now.
But they just took a huge loan out.
Uh,

240
00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.500
yeah.
Like was it a year ago?

241
00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:43.250
Millions and millions of dollars and this was like the second huge learn I think

242
00:14:43.251 --> 00:14:46.340
that they did just to kind of bailed him out and give him some time.

243
00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:47.840
But I told your stock went up.

244
00:14:47.841 --> 00:14:51.830
I thought they were down to like get to $1 and 30 cents 10 cents.

245
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:56.360
<v 0>Oh yeah.
So I mean you could,
it became rich real high at one point in time.</v>

246
00:14:56.390 --> 00:15:00.770
Was that force $4 a doll?
You know,
I don't understand stocks.

247
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:01.821
It was realized,

248
00:15:01.821 --> 00:15:04.940
but I just know if this makes no sense that a company could be worth four times

249
00:15:04.941 --> 00:15:07.760
as much with the products.
Exactly the same.
Like,
oh,
what,
what's going?

250
00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:11.810
What's happening?
They can crash,
the stock can crash.
But what,
what changed?

251
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:14.990
I think the idea of stocks is fucking completely ridiculous.

252
00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:18.560
Do you buy stock at all,
Joe?
Oh,
you said invest in Twitter right now though,

253
00:15:18.561 --> 00:15:22.560
with this periscope buffalo the fuck off.
When you make any money at all?
Man,

254
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.450
I have people that do it.
Yeah.
I mean I do have stocks.
I have,
um,

255
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:31.550
I have funds,
I invested a bunch of different things,
but quite honestly,
I just,

256
00:15:31.551 --> 00:15:35.270
I think the days of people making fuck tons of money just on,

257
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:39.380
on stocks there,
those days are numbered it.
So it's weird times now.

258
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.480
I don't really know what I'm talking about.
I shouldn't say that.
I've,

259
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:45.470
I fucking knew almost nothing about finances.
I invested in,
this was years ago,

260
00:15:45.471 --> 00:15:49.310
I think maybe $2,000 back when it,
and,

261
00:15:49.311 --> 00:15:54.311
and my problem is I have a gambling problem like every other problem.

262
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:59.170
So every day I'm looking at it to see if it went up or down,
you know,
and,

263
00:15:59.171 --> 00:16:02.090
and it's,
you know,
it was going to go on,
this is doing great.

264
00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:03.980
Then all of a sudden dropped.
And I just said,
fuck it.

265
00:16:03.981 --> 00:16:08.220
I gotta stop just because all I'm doing is thinking about is just,

266
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:13.160
and it's only like fucking 2000 bucks or 3000.
But what you invest in,

267
00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:17.000
it was a mutual fund.
So it was a bunch of things together,
right.

268
00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:21.680
And I ended up saying,
I'm done with this.
I made like 400 bucks,

269
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:26.390
but I would have lost it all.
I would have lot.
And it wasn't much,
but it's just,

270
00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:30.160
it consumes your head,
you know?
Cause if you're,
if you're game,

271
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:34.610
if you're in Vegas gambling,
you're thinking,
oh fuck,
I lost it here.

272
00:16:34.611 --> 00:16:37.300
If I get it back here,
if I do this,
if I,
you know,

273
00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:41.320
if I just get 300 today and 300,
you know what I mean?
I identify,

274
00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:45.590
get even then may back in fucking when a little here and that's all your head's

275
00:16:45.591 --> 00:16:48.030
going on when you're gambling in Vegas,
you know,

276
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:51.680
numbers and numbers are going through your fucking head.
Nonstop and Vegas.

277
00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:53.480
All right.
Any casino,

278
00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:58.690
and I can't even imagine which stocks,
how thing.

279
00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:02.180
Yeah,
it's the same exact thing.
Yeah.
You're sitting there all day.
You got 10.

280
00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:05.030
Say you got 10,
you got 10.
Uh,

281
00:17:05.031 --> 00:17:09.890
you're invested in 10 different companies all day long.
You're back and forth.

282
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:13.230
This fucking company,
Susan,
this is,
I get to throw money over here from here.

283
00:17:13.231 --> 00:17:15.620
You know the fuck it's too much.

284
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:19.320
Just go shoot craps and either winter fucking lose.
Yeah.

285
00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:23.690
It certainly is gambling and in that a lot of guys that are attracted to

286
00:17:23.691 --> 00:17:28.310
gambling,
they get involved in stocks.
Then they get the same itch,
the same itch.

287
00:17:28.311 --> 00:17:29.920
It's going up and fucking salad.

288
00:17:29.921 --> 00:17:32.570
Look at the floor when you see the floor and they're yelling and screaming at

289
00:17:32.571 --> 00:17:35.240
each other,
which I don't even think they do anymore.

290
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.130
I don't think they do it the same way.
I mean I think what we were talking about,

291
00:17:40.131 --> 00:17:40.730
um,

292
00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:44.360
that with people that understand who the fuck was it we were talking with when

293
00:17:44.361 --> 00:17:46.190
they was talking about how they've,
um,

294
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:51.760
that people have bought property closer to Wall Street so they could trade

295
00:17:52.951 --> 00:17:57.420
quicker cause it trading with algorithms and it's all about like now seconds.

296
00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:01.540
Like literally that the distance in the pipe between the,

297
00:18:01.541 --> 00:18:05.190
the office and the,
the floor,
the trading floor is,

298
00:18:05.191 --> 00:18:08.760
makes the difference between selling and buying at the right time.

299
00:18:08.761 --> 00:18:10.770
How it's like a lot ping.
Yeah,
exactly.

300
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:14.430
So they invested in all this real estate around that area.

301
00:18:14.431 --> 00:18:19.080
Real estate around Wall Street is fucking worth astronomical amounts of money.

302
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:21.030
Well,
there's just all you need is a small office.

303
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:24.030
Take that some off and you put all your servers and all your stuff and they do

304
00:18:24.031 --> 00:18:27.900
all your,
all your um,
transactions from there.
And it's amazing.
Well,

305
00:18:27.901 --> 00:18:32.901
a lot of the stuff I learned about Wall Street and stock was from trading places

306
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:36.960
show I'm pretty,
I know a lot about it.
Does it go,
she reference point?

307
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.970
They know that was good movement.
Uh,

308
00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:43.740
I see these guys,
but you know,

309
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:47.080
during the whole market crash and the banking and I,

310
00:18:47.081 --> 00:18:51.930
and I'm not really the smartest when it comes to the sub Keck.
Uh,

311
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.380
when people lost their homes,
the fucking life earnings,

312
00:18:55.650 --> 00:19:00.270
not one of those cock suckers,
you went to jail.
Okay.
But you fucking,

313
00:19:00.271 --> 00:19:04.980
you know,
do whatever,
uh,
you know,
uh,
you know,
uh,
who,

314
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.880
you know,
mock.
They're stored in jail for a couple,
but no one from Wall Street,

315
00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:13.050
whichever indicted for anything other than that Bernie Madoff guy.

316
00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:15.360
But that guy was just stealing.
It was a totally different,

317
00:19:15.361 --> 00:19:18.960
and it wasn't Wall Street.
That was to divert your attention from Wall Street.

318
00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:23.370
That was just a Ponzi scheme.
Well,
no,
he had nothing to do with Wall Street.

319
00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:26.610
That was a Ponzi scheme.
Right.
Okay.
He wasn't working down on Wall Street.

320
00:19:26.611 --> 00:19:31.470
He was just scamming people for money.
That,
that wasn't the banking,

321
00:19:31.471 --> 00:19:36.000
you know,
uh,
giving mortgages to people that can't afford them and you know,

322
00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:39.390
it started off with the real estate is start off with a real estate salesman.

323
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:39.631
Yes,

324
00:19:39.631 --> 00:19:43.530
we can get you into this house then to the broker and to the bank and they're

325
00:19:43.531 --> 00:19:47.610
giving out these fucking houses to people that get Bernie and dad kept people's

326
00:19:47.611 --> 00:19:48.930
minds awful.

327
00:19:48.931 --> 00:19:52.890
Really what was going on down in Wall Street because it happened at the same

328
00:19:52.891 --> 00:19:53.370
time.

329
00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:57.000
What amazed me about that Bernie Madoff things that people that understood money

330
00:19:57.001 --> 00:20:01.380
got robbed.
Like a lot of people,
they,
I guess it was just great,

331
00:20:01.381 --> 00:20:06.381
I guess like he was offering such a large percentage of return on your money

332
00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:09.990
that people just,
they just said,
look,
I'm going to take a chance.

333
00:20:09.991 --> 00:20:12.030
This fucking guy,
whatever he's doing,
it's doing it right.

334
00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:16.330
People make it 25% returns on it's crazy returns,
but it was just,

335
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:20.880
he just banked on people not cashing in,
which is just amazing.

336
00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.550
But when's enough enough to when like how much money,

337
00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:27.420
like there's people that lost millions,
you know,
so when's enough,

338
00:20:27.421 --> 00:20:31.460
enough for a person or if you know what I mean,
like look,
take cooperation.

339
00:20:31.461 --> 00:20:32.101
It's when's enough,

340
00:20:32.101 --> 00:20:34.470
enough where you're going to start treating your fucking employees,

341
00:20:34.471 --> 00:20:38.310
like human beings start giving all operations a very tricky because with

342
00:20:38.311 --> 00:20:41.820
corporations it's all about they have to continue to make more money than they

343
00:20:41.821 --> 00:20:44.820
made the last year.
It's all about infinite growth.

344
00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.040
So like if you made $1 million this year,
you have to show them,

345
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:48.491
<v 3>you know,</v>

346
00:20:48.491 --> 00:20:52.750
in a first quarter of the next year we're up 5% and you have to keep doing that.

347
00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:53.980
If you don't keep doing that,

348
00:20:53.981 --> 00:20:58.981
then you're losing money because you have stockholders and your main obligation

349
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.620
is to earn the stockholders money.
Yeah.
That's what you have to do.

350
00:21:02.621 --> 00:21:05.410
And if you don't do that,
they'll get rid of you as a CEO.
Well,
she,

351
00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:08.110
same as any comedy club.
I go to a comedy club,

352
00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:12.010
if they make money and I make money,
what?
Happy.
As long as you don't lose,

353
00:21:12.011 --> 00:21:13.600
you know,
I fight with comedy clubs.
I go,
well,

354
00:21:13.601 --> 00:21:17.020
you didn't lose last time I was there while we didn't make,
well,
look,

355
00:21:17.021 --> 00:21:20.890
you didn't lose it was a,
there was a prophet.
Okay.
Uh,

356
00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:25.270
I talked to these employees from Costco after a show a couple of weeks ago.

357
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:30.370
They're fucking paid 30 something.
And our health insurance,

358
00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:35.410
uh,
you know,
uh,
kickbacks from whatever they spend there.
I mean,

359
00:21:35.411 --> 00:21:40.060
this corporation is great to their employee cost.
Yeah,
they're fucking great.

360
00:21:40.061 --> 00:21:43.060
I'm telling these ladies that had been there 20 years,
18 years,

361
00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:47.080
that are making 35 bucks an hour and,
and,

362
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:51.780
and getting health benefits and,
and,
and,
and,
and whenever they byproducts,

363
00:21:51.781 --> 00:21:56.020
their percentage of that goes into their,
whatever,
fun.
So,
I mean,

364
00:21:56.021 --> 00:21:59.110
it's a great corporation,
but there's other ones,

365
00:21:59.111 --> 00:22:02.410
I don't want to say names because I don't want to get fucking sued,
but you know,

366
00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:05.890
uh,
you know,
when's enough enough,
how much the money,

367
00:22:05.891 --> 00:22:10.891
there's a certain family need before they start taking care of their fucking

368
00:22:10.901 --> 00:22:12.370
employees.
For a lot of folks,

369
00:22:12.371 --> 00:22:15.850
I think what happens is that's the only way that they keep score things,

370
00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:16.240
you know,

371
00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:19.780
the only way he keeps score as money and if you're not making more money than

372
00:22:19.781 --> 00:22:21.730
you were making before,
you feel like you're losing it.

373
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:26.020
They never feel like they're accomplishing anything less than making money.

374
00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:30.280
They don't have a quantifiable score on anything else.

375
00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:31.630
It's not like,
you know,

376
00:22:31.631 --> 00:22:35.200
like if you were doing something else that you really enjoy doing on top of

377
00:22:35.201 --> 00:22:38.020
making that money,
you know,
like something competitive maybe.

378
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:42.640
I think there's a lot of,
a lot of what,
what goes on in business has competition.

379
00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:43.421
You know?
I mean it's,

380
00:22:43.421 --> 00:22:48.421
a lot of it is sort of what made human beings human beings in the first place.

381
00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:53.560
It's like this desire to constantly move ahead constantly.
You know,

382
00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:57.490
make everything better.
Progress.
Keep pushing forward.

383
00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:00.670
Like that whole desire that led to cities,
agriculture,

384
00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:05.880
that's the same sort of instinct that leads people to continually pursue and you

385
00:23:05.951 --> 00:23:08.820
get greedy and greedy here.
Yeah,
it's drive.
Yeah.

386
00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:13.150
The best point is when they don't have anything else to fall back on.
You know,

387
00:23:13.151 --> 00:23:16.510
when they,
I don't know.
I mean,
look,
you look at Trump,

388
00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:22.870
I don't know about his,
I know he knows how to build a fucking golf courses.

389
00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:26.200
This fucking guy who knows how you're a golfer,
so you understand that.

390
00:23:26.201 --> 00:23:30.070
I've been to some of his courses.
He got confused.
Yeah,
he golfs.
You know,

391
00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:34.390
I've heard stories,
but he golfs.
Heard stories,
but it was socks.
No hoodies.
Okay.

392
00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:37.110
I heard his.
Okay.
I,
I,
I'm,
what stories have you heard me say?

393
00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:42.160
He plays a lot of golf.
He plays a lot of Campbell.
Oh,
I don't think so.

394
00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:46.010
I don't know.
I never,
I don't know.
No.
Just saying he'll fly

395
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:49.870
<v 0>in on his helicopter,
you know,
but he likes to when he's,</v>

396
00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:55.060
he likes to win in life and maybe like say let's even say we'll use a Malcolm x

397
00:23:56.061 --> 00:23:59.960
term by any means necessary.
He likes to win.
Okay.

398
00:23:59.961 --> 00:24:04.570
So I don't know.
I feel racial tension in the room.
No,
no,
no.
Uh,

399
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:09.470
awkward boner,
but okay.
So he's is,
is well off in life,

400
00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:14.180
but at least on the side he's doing something that gives him passion.

401
00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:17.810
Do you know any,
he's building these golf courses and he's going a plan.

402
00:24:17.811 --> 00:24:20.360
I'm not pro Donald Trump or anti or saying,

403
00:24:20.361 --> 00:24:25.361
I'm just saying that this is a guy that besides building big fucking skyscrapers

404
00:24:25.881 --> 00:24:29.120
all over New York and everywhere he's got his,

405
00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:33.090
his thing is building and playing golf.
Remember what he was going to say.

406
00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:36.570
A little bottle wasn't born in America who was like,
he was chasing that down.

407
00:24:36.571 --> 00:24:40.970
Obama was born in Kenya and his birth certificate was fake.
But you know,

408
00:24:40.971 --> 00:24:44.680
she'd be funny when that all comes out in Obama says,
you know what you got?

409
00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:51.140
He's done.
Look,
interest of total disclosure.

410
00:24:51.141 --> 00:24:55.190
I am in fact the radical Muslim terrorist of infiltrating and trying to weaken

411
00:24:55.191 --> 00:24:59.690
America from the inside of you.
White people in Iowa.
We're all right.

412
00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:01.940
Yeah.
The one people on the hill,

413
00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.840
all those fucking crazy Christians at that take back America folks.

414
00:25:05.841 --> 00:25:09.620
Have you heard the Rick Santorum Song Take Back America?
We played it yesterday.

415
00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:12.580
Who's ever an office there?

416
00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:16.700
Every the other side's going to hate him and trash him and do whatever.
I mean,

417
00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:20.450
look at Butch stunk.
Obama is not the best president on the planet either.

418
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:25.280
None of them.
None of you know,
if you're a fucking Jew that votes for Obama.

419
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:29.300
There's gotta be,
I mean,
he's not really,
really pro Israel.
You know,

420
00:25:29.301 --> 00:25:30.111
he's not an [inaudible],

421
00:25:30.111 --> 00:25:34.730
but he's not so do you have to be pro Israel is a big cause.
Here's the thing,

422
00:25:34.731 --> 00:25:36.110
you don't have to be pro Israel,

423
00:25:36.111 --> 00:25:39.680
but antisemitism that runs rapid throughout Europe.

424
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:43.460
Rampant it.
That's the word.
It's rapid as well.
No,

425
00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:45.410
I'm fucking,

426
00:25:45.411 --> 00:25:48.680
this isn't a fucking the Bonnie or Norton correcting me.

427
00:25:48.681 --> 00:25:51.170
I say something wrong words.
I mean now and then,
but you know what I'm saying.

428
00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:54.220
But you know what I'm talking about?
What did I say?
Rapid.

429
00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:59.180
I'm pretty sure he'd say rapid.
Rapid.
No,
Brad pit or rapid,

430
00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:02.990
I bet you can say ramp.
It runs rampant or rapid.

431
00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:07.970
Rampant or rice and ramp it.
Let's look it up.
Rampant.

432
00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:10.190
Rampant.
I said rampant.

433
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:16.220
It's rampant.
Rampant.
Okay.
What'd I say?
Ramp.

434
00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:20.540
You said rapid?
I'm pretty sure it runs rat.
Could have been anything.

435
00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:24.620
It could have been,
but you know what I was talking about how basically,
okay,

436
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:25.730
antisocial it.

437
00:26:25.731 --> 00:26:29.090
Just in case someone listening is young and impressionable and they might go use

438
00:26:29.091 --> 00:26:30.860
that same word like when they were running,

439
00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:34.460
you're going for a job interview or something like,
okay.
Well,
you know,

440
00:26:34.461 --> 00:26:38.900
I think disinformation runs rapid throughout this world.
Okay.
I,

441
00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:44.410
we'll talk about a couple of things.
I know that I can't fuck up.
Okay.
Uh,

442
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:49.640
so Jews,
Obama what?
Okay,
so the antisemitism throughout Europe,

443
00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:54.520
right?
How to control,
oh,
have you seen that thing in France?
You know,
they,

444
00:26:54.521 --> 00:26:58.420
they had,
uh,
this,
uh,
guy dressed up as a Jew walking through these,
uh,

445
00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:03.000
Muslim neighborhoods in Paris.
Like,
Whoa,
there's some fucking sear.

446
00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:06.760
That's obviously we're Charlie Hebdo happened where they killed those guys for

447
00:27:06.761 --> 00:27:09.320
drawing those cartoons at Mohammed.
Um,

448
00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:12.470
there's a lot of antisemitism in Europe.
Yes.

449
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:15.870
I was talking to Ari about it and uh,
Ari and his brother,

450
00:27:15.871 --> 00:27:20.280
his brother actually lives in Europe and he said that essentially they were just

451
00:27:20.281 --> 00:27:22.330
like really tolerant of,
uh,

452
00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:26.790
of all sorts of different religions and a lot of like really radical people

453
00:27:26.791 --> 00:27:30.330
moved there because of that,
because it was a good place for them.
Well,

454
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.670
it's going to overflow.
Whatever happened,

455
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:36.120
it overflows to antisemitism in his cabinet.

456
00:27:36.121 --> 00:27:40.500
People in this country really think huge run this country.

457
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:41.940
They really think that,
huh?

458
00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:45.990
Do you really can hear I'm getting these newsletters and three,
I,

459
00:27:45.991 --> 00:27:48.390
I was explaining to a comic,
you know,
you run this kind of,

460
00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:52.680
there's 3% of us in this country,
3% now.

461
00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:56.400
They've done really well though.
Yeah,
she was good.
Yeah.
But how could you,

462
00:27:56.620 --> 00:28:01.620
if we did that would say the other 90% 97% are pretty fucking,

463
00:28:02.221 --> 00:28:06.590
we need to get this number 3% now.
Now wait a second.
Now we just had,

464
00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:10.590
and I'm saying this just Kinda,
you know,
you know the wash run this country,

465
00:28:10.591 --> 00:28:13.840
fucking Walmart,
Chase Manhattan Bank.

466
00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:17.690
It's all fucking waspy old school money,
right?

467
00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:22.290
But dish fucking world and country could not survive without cues.

468
00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:25.800
Medicine,
science,
the arts.

469
00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:29.910
Fucking we have given back more to this country.

470
00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:34.440
You were player that,
yes I am.
I kill on stage every time I listen to me.

471
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:38.570
If you're in Ventura this weekend at the Ventura harbor common again on there

472
00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.300
Friday,
it's a great place.
Friday through Sunday,
I,

473
00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:44.670
they have top notch comedians there.
I'm there this week or this week,

474
00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.850
I don't fail.
Okay.
A word or two might get messed up,

475
00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:51.030
but you'll know what I'm saying.
But I'm not going to fucking fail.

476
00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.540
So Jews have given back to society.

477
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:57.000
We've won more Nobel prizes,

478
00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:01.380
percentage for science and medicine than anybody else.

479
00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:06.150
That's true.
Jews.
They're like number one when it comes to biology.

480
00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:10.260
Fuck these phones right here.
What do you think that technology came from?
LSD.

481
00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:14.460
Koreans,
glues.
No,
no.
There are Chinese people and Steve Jobs,

482
00:29:14.461 --> 00:29:19.350
he did ask these Wazniak they listened to.
He was the genius behind it all.

483
00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:21.290
I,
no,

484
00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:26.100
he dared the ones who build the technology in them.
Oh,
Jews.

485
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:30.570
Yeah,
sure.
Yes.
Part of the phone right here.

486
00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.880
Okay.
Three fists to this phone.
She,
that's the part with the notifications here.

487
00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:40.650
This area Asian.
Okay.
Asian.
Okay.

488
00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:42.070
Is that this area right

489
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:45.290
<v 3>here,
down in the bottom corner.
You Know Italians?
Yeah.</v>

490
00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:48.580
My people don't contribute shit.
Yes you do.
I would never buy a Ferrari.

491
00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.980
Ever the fucking tires or fly off on a highway.

492
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.370
You guys pay attention construction.
What?
Are you kidding me?

493
00:29:54.371 --> 00:29:57.940
You're running construction?
Maybe barely little artistic stuff,
but not,

494
00:29:57.941 --> 00:30:02.380
not nothing engineering wise.
I don't trust them.
Hey.
Nah,
you know Italians,

495
00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.600
I got to admit Dave.
Dave had a lot.

496
00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:09.040
I'm not impressed how you're not not impressing my own people.
I don't know.

497
00:30:09.041 --> 00:30:12.720
I just fucking kill you.
Didn't she?
Boardwalk Empire.
I fucking,
I saw him.

498
00:30:12.721 --> 00:30:15.390
He held up in,
you know,
it's just,

499
00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:17.860
I think that like when it comes to technology,

500
00:30:17.861 --> 00:30:20.560
the people that are most impressed with the Japanese and the Germans,

501
00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:22.930
Japanese and the Germans seem to,

502
00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:26.980
especially when it comes to engineering like a cars,
automotive engineering,

503
00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.010
it was hard to fuck with those two people.
Yes,

504
00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:31.650
I have a Japanese and Germans like fits it.
You know,

505
00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:34.570
Americans are like a third now.

506
00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.050
Americans like the new American cars are pretty fucking good.

507
00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:40.540
Like have you seen those new Cadillacs look like space ships,

508
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:45.550
cts vs the fucking beautiful man.
I mean they finally nailed it.
Like the new,

509
00:30:45.551 --> 00:30:49.300
I drove one of those escalades I rented an escalated,
it's amazing.

510
00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:53.050
The new one is fucking fantastic.
It is a great car.

511
00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.830
It handles like a,
like a much smaller car.

512
00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:01.780
I mean it's an enormous SUV but they have this magnetic control suspension and

513
00:31:01.781 --> 00:31:05.650
it handles like,
like a,
like an s class Mercedes.
It's incredible.

514
00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:10.270
The entire dashboard is a screen like the dashboard.
Is it like a laptop?

515
00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.930
Like there's no real gages like it.
It's a,

516
00:31:13.931 --> 00:31:17.540
it's a laptop screens and LCD screen.
Also bad ideas.

517
00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:21.640
You know what else is great?
The navigation system is fucking huge.

518
00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:26.230
So you get this huge screen that's your,
all your gauges,
you gauge cluster,

519
00:31:26.231 --> 00:31:30.430
it's all lcds.
And then to the right,
that navigation screens fucking massive.

520
00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:34.480
I'm going to start off at the expensive and if it's really sunlight daylight,

521
00:31:34.481 --> 00:31:38.680
it is that can you not see or you're like damn,
it has a light sensor in it.

522
00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:39.970
So it turns dark.

523
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.830
It turns black when it's a at nighttime and it turns white way to daytime.

524
00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:47.620
I just show that's what it looks like.
I just fucking see that LCD cluster there.

525
00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:52.330
That is all one big screen.
Like all that shit you see where it's two gauges,

526
00:31:52.331 --> 00:31:57.040
it's not really two gauges.
That's all.
That's all one flat screen.

527
00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:01.570
And so is the a thing to the right,
the navigation scream.
I was very impressed.

528
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.110
That's someone's tits.
I would,
uh,
I don't know.

529
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:06.430
It was probably someone calling you or something.

530
00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:10.630
I would totally buy one of those.
I,
you know,
I have the Lexus,
that big Lexus Suv,

531
00:32:10.631 --> 00:32:14.100
which I love,
but I would definitely buy one of his Cadillac,
you know,

532
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:17.320
so funny of tech.
Not like I have two German cars,

533
00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:20.890
but I don't have navigation in them.
What?
Well,
I,

534
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:25.570
I have a 2013 Mercedes,
no navigation,
but I have,

535
00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.030
you know what's funny,
I have a Garmin or whatever,

536
00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:31.690
but you could tell she had an old,
and this is in a bit,
this is true,

537
00:32:31.691 --> 00:32:36.600
but it will be a bit as of this weekend,
uh,
when I,
when,

538
00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:40.190
when she talks to me,
she's breaking up.
It's like she's getting old

539
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:42.680
<v 0>and dying.
The voice in my Garmin,</v>

540
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:47.830
like she'll go make a turn at exit and then it will stop and she'll stop talking

541
00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:53.100
and then it will pick up again and,
and I feel like the whole thing is just,

542
00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:56.210
she's dying,
whoever the lady is.
You know what I'm saying?

543
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:59.850
It's so outdated that the fucking,

544
00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:04.750
you could feel you I have to put it to rest and get a car with navigation or

545
00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:08.750
what the problem as all of them can't fuck with this.
Yeah.
This is the best.

546
00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:09.910
When I Google something,

547
00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:13.100
I want to know what it is and then it says directions and I pressed directions

548
00:33:13.101 --> 00:33:16.880
and it goes Bluetooth through my,
uh,
through my stereo.
Oh ways man.

549
00:33:16.881 --> 00:33:19.510
With the police,
like you know when the police are up ahead,

550
00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.450
you know the police are using ways and they're,

551
00:33:21.451 --> 00:33:24.050
they're faking police stops there.

552
00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:27.470
The calling and fake ones to ways just to fuck with the whole system.

553
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:32.510
Well my bond use,
I haven't used this yet.
It eats up a lot of data,
doesn't it?

554
00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:37.220
When you a dress.
So I don't know.
I don't know.
It doesn't go well.

555
00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:41.840
What are you worried about your dad and cutting on your prices down to Ventura?

556
00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:44.180
Well,
let me explain something to you.
Okay.

557
00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:48.920
I have three fucking kids that are,
two of them are elks or on my phone.

558
00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:52.430
Okay.
Two,
two older daughters that I have to cut.

559
00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:57.010
Luke 24 and 22 there's still on your plan?
Yes,
I,

560
00:33:57.070 --> 00:34:02.060
yes,
I know.
Cut To,
I know.
Cut Him loose a fucking job kid.
No.
My daughter,

561
00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:05.210
22 years old,
just moved to Houston,

562
00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:08.340
called me last week 22.
Uh,

563
00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.940
I just got hired starting at 50,000 a year.

564
00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:13.520
That's pretty fucking good for a 22 words in it.

565
00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:18.190
And you send in what you do for a living hot.
Uh,
she's a buyer for her.

566
00:34:18.410 --> 00:34:21.050
She's a buyer for like clothing.
Oh,
okay.
Cool.

567
00:34:21.051 --> 00:34:24.770
And my other daughter graduated for 22.
That's a great gig.

568
00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:28.190
That's fucking a real great gig.
That's very good.
That's what must be talented.

569
00:34:28.191 --> 00:34:32.750
I'll put her on my family plan.
Give her,
give me her number.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I really,

570
00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:36.020
I'd rather give it,
I'd rather give her number to Farah Khan and give it to them.

571
00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:39.740
Okay.
If you're concerned about data,
as an example,

572
00:34:39.741 --> 00:34:43.040
I just switched over to t mobile,
$50 or $100 a month.

573
00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:46.910
You could have up to five phones and unlimited everything.
Data,
everything.

574
00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:50.300
You could have up to five phones on it.
That's pretty amazing.
I'm what t mobile.

575
00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:54.090
It's got the best network.
At least in Los Angeles.
It's the best.
Better.

576
00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:58.400
I'm on a better than Verizon as far as phone calls I've had,

577
00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:03.430
I've had both Verizon at and t and sprint compared to t mobile and the last like

578
00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:04.370
six months.

579
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:08.720
And Verizon actually was the worst where I lived in Los Angeles and then B where

580
00:35:08.721 --> 00:35:11.840
you live and that's important.
You know where you got to find out where you live.

581
00:35:11.841 --> 00:35:15.730
Like I used to live in a spot where I could only use a t and t like at and t was

582
00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:18.600
the only thing that worked.
Comedy House comedy store,
uh,

583
00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:23.160
Verizon who is almost zero bars but uh,
are not t-mobile.

584
00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:25.040
It's like 30 upload.

585
00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:28.640
Well that doesn't make any sense cause I use the Verizon at the comedy store all

586
00:35:28.641 --> 00:35:30.150
the time and it works perfect.
Yeah,

587
00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:33.400
I'll do a speed test with you tonight or tomorrow.
It wouldn't download,
test,

588
00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:38.070
download and upload.
It's amazing.
Maybe that,
but as,
as like phone calls,

589
00:35:38.071 --> 00:35:41.790
which was all I use it for other than like occasionally I do periscope from

590
00:35:41.791 --> 00:35:46.770
there,
which I like doing now.
That's fine.
Yeah.
But this phone I bought this,
uh,

591
00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.121
you just falling six.

592
00:35:48.121 --> 00:35:52.110
I bought it through Verizon phone and they'll buy it from you.
They'll,

593
00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:56.940
they'll pay your,
your contract charge that you'll pay me off.
Cause once you're,

594
00:35:56.941 --> 00:35:59.850
you know,
I mean I'm fucking locked in with Verizon.

595
00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.750
I mean it's just some gangster shit pay.

596
00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:05.830
They'll pay all of the contracts and that is to get you out of it.

597
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:09.840
They're losing money like crazy,
but they're just that this new president,

598
00:36:09.841 --> 00:36:13.230
that t mobile has a,
he's an amazing guy and he,
dude,

599
00:36:13.231 --> 00:36:15.450
I've made fun of t mobile my whole entire life.

600
00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:19.470
It was the best which I've ever made.
And now you're saying it's unlimited data,

601
00:36:19.471 --> 00:36:22.980
unlimited everything.
How long before they have it where it's like in China,

602
00:36:22.981 --> 00:36:26.160
in China you can be in the middle of the forest and you get five bars.

603
00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:27.750
They said that it's unbelievable.

604
00:36:27.751 --> 00:36:31.470
Like they have the best cell phone signals that is,
I don't know what they have.

605
00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.260
Five G is about to come out.
Is it really?
Yeah.
When is that coming on?

606
00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:36.720
Next three years.
I think.
This is what they're saying.

607
00:36:36.721 --> 00:36:41.600
What is that going to be like?
[inaudible] fast [inaudible] movies.
Yeah.
Yeah.

608
00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:45.450
Hd Four K you guys,
you're taking off.
You Go,
Oh,
I need this movie.

609
00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:48.840
And before it hits the air.
Yep.
You have to move.
It's awesome.

610
00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.230
I love dish phone when it comes to the phone.
I love it.

611
00:36:52.231 --> 00:36:54.990
It's a great phones at the top end phones now,
like the Samsung,

612
00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:59.280
the galaxy s six and the iPhone 60 they're amazing.

613
00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:03.000
It's just hard to complain.
Fucking skyping with my kids and it's amazing.

614
00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:04.890
It's just amazing.
This stuff.

615
00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:09.810
What does that 10 gigabytes per second?
So 10 kids.

616
00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:14.160
Oh my God.

617
00:37:14.161 --> 00:37:17.880
Fast enough to deliver a full length HD movie on your phone in a matter of

618
00:37:17.881 --> 00:37:18.714
seconds.

619
00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:23.100
10 times faster than Google fiber and 40 times faster than four g.

620
00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.840
That is fucking incredible.

621
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:29.820
10 times faster than Google fiber is mindblowing.
Yeah.
Well,
you know what?

622
00:37:29.821 --> 00:37:34.260
We're probably going to wind up doing the podcast through that.
Once it's up,

623
00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:40.050
we'll probably wind up doing that.
And when you start using that,
thank the Jews,

624
00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:45.030
the Jews,
I guarantee it was like a Korean dude who created that.
Let's find out.

625
00:37:45.031 --> 00:37:49.830

So the Jews,

627

Oh Man.

628
00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:01.710
What is Nokia find out?

629
00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:06.690
I'm pretty sure what is Nokia bought it,
but no kia sounds Japanese.

630
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:11.940
It's a Finnish Finnish,
uh,

right?
Nokia.

631
00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:17.820
Nokia,
yeah.
Finish whenever finished from Finland.

632
00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:21.580
No,
Jews in Finland.
They have,
they run from hiking.

633
00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:25.950
Fucking watch.
Uh,
the Americans,
the Russians,

634
00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:30.180
bosses like didn't you see trading places?

635
00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:36.160
Like she watched the Americans.
Okay.
You'll learn,
I'm

636
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.510
<v 2>telling you here is from the TV box.</v>

637
00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:43.980
That's how it works to fucking rapid ascension to grace or whatever it is.

638
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:50.600
I,
here's somebody Lippitt discrimination.
Here's,
ah,

639
00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:55.030
here's what Joe Rogan started and he didn't even know he started this.

640
00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:58.450
Uh,
we're,
we're doing our podcast,
Bonnie and I,

641
00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:04.530
and I know if we got a tweet or a message at Rogen and theirs and we look up,

642
00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:10.780
we respect you.
We like it.
We think you're great.
And you know,
we're big fans.

643
00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:16.140
And we were,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
The blood is what you did.
Uh,

644
00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:20.470
and,
and,
and there's no reason for us to even worry about their spot.

645
00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:25.240
When we heard Rogan,
uh,
in a tweet saying,

646
00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:28.150
uh,
Tom and,
uh,

647
00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:31.360
Christine are the funniest comedy couple on the planet.

648
00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:36.440
And Bonnie and I were a little hurt.
So we had to do some research and,
and,

649
00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:41.410
and that's okay because they could be,
I don't know them from Adam.
I don't,

650
00:39:41.411 --> 00:39:44.830
I've never met him.
I hear a thing.
I hear his name and her name.

651
00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:48.130
I never heard him.
I never heard their podcast.
But Bonnie and I,

652
00:39:48.131 --> 00:39:52.150
we put it out there.
If you listen to our podcasts are so long thing,
you know,
uh,

653
00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:56.950
Tom and,
uh,
Christine,
uh,
cease and desist,
you know,
stop.

654
00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:58.690
Uh,
we were the first,

655
00:39:58.691 --> 00:40:01.600
but then we looked into what date they did their podcasts before ours,

656
00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:06.350
but we've challenged any comedy couple to tennis,
you know,

657
00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:10.930
that's not comedy though.
I didn't say they were the best tennis comedy cup.
Well,

658
00:40:10.931 --> 00:40:15.370
I mean,
I don't believe in Cambodia,
no oil wrestle,

659
00:40:15.371 --> 00:40:18.560
match tennis,
you know,
and,
and,
and we said,
you know,

660
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:22.790
we'll play them in monopoly,
you know.

661
00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:28.930
Oh yeah,
I don't even know them,

662
00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:30.400
but I'm going to tell you right now,

663
00:40:30.401 --> 00:40:33.100
they don't want to get involved in a roast battle.

664
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:35.050
Would ritual walks and Bonnie and macfarlane.

665
00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:38.260
I just what I'm saying cause we'll have to do it in our house.

666
00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:40.580
You,

667
00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:45.570
<v 3>you are a very funny comic.
And uh,
so it was Bonnie and so are they.</v>

668
00:40:45.571 --> 00:40:49.140
I haven't seen bind you stand up in a long time,
but Bonnie is fucking hilarious.

669
00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:52.680
She's a very funny comic.
And your movie that you did,

670
00:40:52.681 --> 00:40:56.070
we should plug that movie because it's fucking awesome.
Women aren't funny.

671
00:40:56.250 --> 00:41:00.300
It's great.
It's fucking great.
It's really great.
And you can get on iTunes.

672
00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:03.360
It's out there right now and you should get it to support it because Bonnie

673
00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:07.290
edited that whole fucking thing herself.
Director.
She directed it,
edit it.

674
00:41:07.291 --> 00:41:11.730
She's a monster.
I mean she,
she knocked it out of the park.
Um,
but I'm just,

675
00:41:11.731 --> 00:41:14.970
I'm around Tom and Christina on a regular basis.
If I was around you guys,

676
00:41:14.971 --> 00:41:17.310
I'd probably maybe say the same thing about you guys,

677
00:41:17.311 --> 00:41:19.110
but I'm around them all the time.
I'm telling you,

678
00:41:19.111 --> 00:41:23.340
Christina Palicki murdered at the comedy store last week.

679
00:41:23.341 --> 00:41:26.700
So hard.
It was like,
it was painful to watch.
Not Loud.

680
00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:28.890
It wasn't last week because last lawsuit goes in Vegas.
So it was,

681
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:33.620
it had to be the weekend before she fucking destroyed,
I mean,

682
00:41:33.621 --> 00:41:34.190
leveled

683
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:38.030
<v 0>the place.
Uh,
and I,
and,
and she said afterwards,
she goes,</v>

684
00:41:38.031 --> 00:41:42.180
I'm finally starting to like get this room.
She had a late spot and you know,

685
00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:45.740
it's a long shot.
She actually went on after me.
I brought her up.

686
00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:49.050
She fucking murder dude.
She's really good.
I'm not,

687
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:54.180
I'm not saying stand up.
I've never seen,
I've heard nothing.
I've said,

688
00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:57.380
I'm not what you're saying,
but I'm talking podcast.

689
00:41:57.381 --> 00:42:01.310
Has He ever made her cry and walk off the podcast?
No.

690
00:42:01.311 --> 00:42:05.210
They have a really good relationship.
It's very different than yours.
Yeah.
Okay.

691
00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:06.620
All right.
Has she,

692
00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:12.080
has she ever blown him on their podcasts?
Probably.
I don't know.

693
00:42:12.081 --> 00:42:15.590
Maybe as dirt has not.
He blown you while you guys were doing a podcast,

694
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:20.660
which we'll do anything for hit.
Yes.
That's what we're about.

695
00:42:20.850 --> 00:42:22.910
Which did you get harder?
Only like three quarters.

696
00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:26.930
You know what's the worst when you're fucking jerking off and you're not really

697
00:42:26.931 --> 00:42:28.760
hard and you come and you're going,

698
00:42:28.761 --> 00:42:33.230
how the fuck did I come and I'm not even hard.
It's getting old.
I fucking,

699
00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:38.060
he's also just disinterested cause I did it once when I was 23 my Bonnie says,

700
00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:42.560
but he say when I was 2015 fucking funny.

701
00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:47.570
Bonnie says every year she gives me one extra second.
This is so funny to,

702
00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:51.350
I could do anything with a girl for sure.
I'm up to nine seconds.

703
00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:56.630
We've been married,
we've been married nine years,
right?
So I have nine seconds.

704
00:42:56.631 --> 00:42:59.150
Well I can do anything I want.
Whether girl for nine seconds.

705
00:42:59.151 --> 00:43:03.770
So you're fucking girlfriend.
Nine seconds for 29 20 year anniversary.

706
00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:06.500
Yeah,
it'll fly 20 seconds.
The other day,

707
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:11.300
the other day she blew me and I came so quick and she started,
she said,

708
00:43:11.301 --> 00:43:13.140
I'm starting to rethink that whole nine second

709
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:19.280
isn't it funny girl just puts your Dick in her mouth.

710
00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:23.390
That's not as bad as if you come.
You know,

711
00:43:23.391 --> 00:43:26.300
like if you come then it's like a finalize the agreement.

712
00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:29.440
You've signed the mortgage papers,
it's great.

713
00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:34.220
So it's a human car wash for your Dick.
Not only say feel good,

714
00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:37.850
you're getting your dip cleaned,
she's blowing you with her fucking mouth.

715
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:41.440
That's one way to look at it.
But what I was saying,
it wasn't weird that it's,

716
00:43:41.441 --> 00:43:42.260
it's she's,

717
00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:46.250
she's concerned not just that a girl's blowing you cause the girl is still

718
00:43:46.251 --> 00:43:47.600
blowing over here the nine seconds,

719
00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:51.950
but that you came like that's the issue that you come.
If you didn't come,

720
00:43:51.951 --> 00:43:56.730
it wouldn't be as bad.
Like if a girl boy for the as time's up.
Oh so close.
Yeah,

721
00:43:56.810 --> 00:44:00.590
that's better.
What we see.
If a girl's sucks your Dick and you're like,
Ooh,

722
00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:04.880
well here's what I would do if I,
if I ever use this tonight checking rule,

723
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:09.050
obviously I would jerk off until the point of it goes down.

724
00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:12.500
I'll do it right now.
Do it for nine seconds and then I'd fucking explode.

725
00:44:12.501 --> 00:44:14.880
But you had a low pressure.
I mean,
you might not,

726
00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:18.090
there's no pressure from me when it comes to come and there's nothing I'm going

727
00:44:18.091 --> 00:44:22.250
to fucking,
I have,
I am the most disappointing person when it comes to sex.

728
00:44:22.251 --> 00:44:23.450
I am fucking the worst.

729
00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:26.570
I bet it's a lot of dudes out there that are up in arms right now.

730
00:44:26.571 --> 00:44:28.700
They'll tell you they're more disappointed than you know,

731
00:44:28.701 --> 00:44:31.980
I it because when you get back,
you know,
you don't do

732
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:35.460
<v 2>it for so long when you're married,
you know,
two weeks,
three weeks,
whatever.</v>

733
00:44:35.461 --> 00:44:37.570
And you know,
we'd rather,
you know,
do you want to do it to,

734
00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:41.790
and I just get a snack,
a whatever,
you know what I mean?
And it's just not,

735
00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:45.750
we don't love each other.
Just man,
what the fuck?
So then it builds up,
you know,

736
00:44:45.751 --> 00:44:49.110
the fucking build up,
you know,
and then I just go,

737
00:44:49.111 --> 00:44:53.250
tell me one dumb story of you fucking a professor or anything and then boom,

738
00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:56.100
what do you think you're gonna use your nine seconds on?

739
00:44:56.101 --> 00:44:58.500
If you got to pick the girl,
are you going to go like old and black?

740
00:44:58.501 --> 00:45:03.000
Are you going to go young?
And Red Eye.
He's gotta be uncut,

741
00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:08.150
cut,
cut,
cut,

742
00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:11.370
bushmen leaves over his Dick.

743
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:17.010
Not put the spirit down.
It's all good.
Like the best way for fucking for me.

744
00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:21.990
And I don't know how I got this is from behind.
That's your best way.

745
00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:24.630
Yeah.
Well you don't come as quick.
You don't have to look at the person,

746
00:45:24.631 --> 00:45:29.400
you know that it's kind of like,
it's a good animalistic.
Yeah.

747
00:45:29.401 --> 00:45:33.600
It's more as parking.
It's more control.
Like,
you know,
huh?

748
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:37.710
You can imagine it's a guy not,
let's not get crazy.
I'm not Norton.
Uh,

749
00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:41.490
so whatever.
So the whole time.

750
00:45:41.491 --> 00:45:44.650
So we hear this thing that you said about Tom and Christian.
We don't know them.

751
00:45:44.651 --> 00:45:47.490
I,
we see your name,
tennis against them and that,

752
00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:50.520
now I'm starting to think about this roast battle.
Uh,

753
00:45:50.521 --> 00:45:55.290
I'm kind of liking that other idea of the roast battle.
A great double team,

754
00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:59.320
you know,
uh,
you know,
I'll be great as long as you pick the judges.

755
00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:01.163
Roast battle.
Yeah.

756
00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.070
<v 3>It's very dependent upon judges.</v>

757
00:46:03.071 --> 00:46:05.880
You gotta make sure you get actual comics as judges get no,

758
00:46:05.881 --> 00:46:10.510
well not some friend of someone that sneaks on or someone's grandfathered in and

759
00:46:10.511 --> 00:46:12.750
you gotta you gotta make sure you get good.
That's like,

760
00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:15.730
that's a big part of roast battle because it makes sure you get good judges.

761
00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:19.850
<v 2>Yeah,
no,
I went the other night to the store and Jeff Goes,
you want to,
uh,
help.</v>

762
00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:21.890
Help does perfect at it.
Yeah.

763
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:25.330
<v 3>It's a goddamn great show.
When they do that Rose Battle in those guys jump up.</v>

764
00:46:25.331 --> 00:46:28.440
When someone nails somebody,
those guys jump up and do their,

765
00:46:28.441 --> 00:46:33.130
their dances and oh my God,
it was funny.
They had a suicide bomb once with a,

766
00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:36.970
the guy run down,
he had a vest on,
pressed a button,
some things flew up.

767
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.170
They got confetti to flies through the air.
I mean,
they do some wild shit.

768
00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:44.950
It's a great guy,
Dan Bunco.
It's a good idea.
It's very fun.
You know,

769
00:46:44.951 --> 00:46:47.470
they've had people write articles about it,

770
00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:51.280
like negative articles about it because they'll say anything like,

771
00:46:51.281 --> 00:46:55.780
all bets are off.
It is the fucking nastiest show in Hollywood.

772
00:46:56.020 --> 00:47:00.340
But that's what you know going in.
It is fiction.
Okay.

773
00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:04.600
And part of comedy sometimes is saying really low,

774
00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:08.170
fucked up,
racist,
homophobic,

775
00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:13.150
sexist shit.
And they clued including men,
whites to blacks,

776
00:47:13.151 --> 00:47:15.430
blacks to whites,
women to men.

777
00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:19.090
It's the most hurtful cutting shit you can say.

778
00:47:19.091 --> 00:47:22.840
And everybody knows what you're doing.
Everybody knows that's the jokes.

779
00:47:23.410 --> 00:47:25.090
That's how roasts are set up.

780
00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:29.620
And they even had the race just guy in the corner were white table,
but he's,

781
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:34.220
what's his name?
Earl can go Whitney rice

782
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:38.080
playing characters.
They're playing racist characters.

783
00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:41.200
People have like complained about it and wrote blogs about it.

784
00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:44.800
We should find who those fucking people are and ban them for every comedy club

785
00:47:44.801 --> 00:47:49.330
in the country.
Who Fuck you.
How can you get it?
How can you not exactly.
Well,

786
00:47:49.331 --> 00:47:54.070
how can you pretend that what that is is you know that these are real statements

787
00:47:54.071 --> 00:47:58.360
are looking to comedy central roasts.
Some of the most vile things are said,

788
00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:01.610
but just because his comedy central,
they can get away.
And I,

789
00:48:01.611 --> 00:48:03.460
I'm for comedy central roast.

790
00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:08.490
Take that multiply by five and that's roast battle like literally the next one's

791
00:48:08.651 --> 00:48:11.530
going to be amazing.
Kimberly condom versus PDC.

792
00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:17.460
Pete's going down peanuts in deep truck hymns four and zero and I think Pete

793
00:48:17.501 --> 00:48:20.330
might be one in five or something.
That pizza monster.

794
00:48:20.331 --> 00:48:24.720
It's in one in five means he won one time.
Yes.

795
00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:29.270
I said sports.
Give me a quote

796
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:36.160
on the team.
Next one.
The two guys you other night.
They both were I think four.

797
00:48:36.161 --> 00:48:38.590
No,
that's the first time I've ever went to it.

798
00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:43.490
One was Indian and one with some slop,
but sloth,

799
00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:47.740
I mean just big fat guy.
But he was fun.
They had some great lines.

800
00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:50.670
Were you there too?
I watched it on periscope.
Yeah,

801
00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:55.930
they have some good fucking line.
It's a joke writing thing.

802
00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:59.510
I mean that's really what it is.
It's a great show though.
It's perfect length go.

803
00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:04.030
It's like an hour long,
you know,
it's amazing.
It was a lot of fun.
Hanging out.

804
00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:07.780
Door is on fire right now.
Last night.
Okay.

805
00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:12.640
Last night it was two shows,
two sold out shows in the fucking belly room.

806
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.180
We do this.
Um,

807
00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:18.940
we just started doing this Nicu Sif and I started doing this new material show.

808
00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:21.310
When you go up there,
you have to do all your new shit.

809
00:49:21.490 --> 00:49:24.410
Like you can't do any established jokes if you've done a bit more than like,

810
00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:27.070
I think we came up with a number like five to seven times.

811
00:49:27.071 --> 00:49:30.700
It's like after that amount,
like it's over.
Like you can't do it anymore.

812
00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:35.320
It's not new.
You know,
and we,
we had all these comics go up,
did that,

813
00:49:35.321 --> 00:49:37.810
that was sold out.
Then there was a dollar show,

814
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:41.560
$1 to get him and it was all like a doorman.
All the doormen put together.

815
00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:44.200
That was sold out to Dalea.
Did that show.

816
00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:49.310
Then I go over to the main room and Bill Burr,
magical,
uh,

817
00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:53.350
Bert Kreischer.
I went up there.
That was sold out too.
That was last night.
Yeah.

818
00:49:53.351 --> 00:49:55.600
That was packed at the same time.

819
00:49:55.630 --> 00:50:00.040
The ors got a show at the same fucking time and that's packed.
It was madness.

820
00:50:00.041 --> 00:50:01.630
That's how that shakes.
They should've been for the,

821
00:50:01.631 --> 00:50:05.770
like the last 20 years in Hawaii.
It was just magic.

822
00:50:05.771 --> 00:50:10.240
Why you're the shit manager.
They got rid of the shit manager and exploded.

823
00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:15.040
It had just flourish.
But how does it manage her death?
He is death.

824
00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:17.890
He was just aids.
He was Ebola.
He was all the above.

825
00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:22.420
He was a shit sandwich served to you on a fucking and the dog Dick Platter.

826
00:50:22.421 --> 00:50:25.180
It was the worst.
Everybody avoided the guy.

827
00:50:25.181 --> 00:50:28.040
I mean that was one of crusher was there last night for the first

828
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.240
<v 0>time in 10 years.
Yeah.
He goes,
I'm never there because of that guy.
Yeah.</v>

829
00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:34.160
The guy who used to be the manager,
you know,
and now you know,

830
00:50:34.161 --> 00:50:37.820
they've got Eric and they've got Adam from of the Tempe Improv and it's fucking

831
00:50:37.821 --> 00:50:40.850
for next Wednesday I got Dane Cook on on a show,

832
00:50:40.851 --> 00:50:43.680
which is crazy cause Jane grew up.
I like the laugh factory.

833
00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:46.190
Never went to the comedy store is even more crazy.
You got them on,

834
00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:49.620
cause there's a lot of crazy things in this world.
He,
last night he was,
uh,

835
00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:53.450
I went out at the Improv.
That place was packed.
Hop and comedy.

836
00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:54.800
Right now we were talking about this,

837
00:50:54.801 --> 00:50:58.310
that comedy is probably right now in the golden age,

838
00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:00.860
I think this is the golden age of standup comedy,
you know,

839
00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:03.380
I mean last night at the fucking store that showed,

840
00:51:03.381 --> 00:51:08.381
they did in the main room between magical and crusher and bill burr was hosting

841
00:51:09.111 --> 00:51:12.590
it and we saw monster fucking show,
and I'm thinking about this,
I'm like,

842
00:51:12.591 --> 00:51:16.460
look at how many great comics are are today.
It's,
it's amazing.

843
00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:21.230
It's such a great time to watch comedy,
you know,
two amazing time.

844
00:51:21.550 --> 00:51:25.850
There's so many good,
great comics and just New York and La.

845
00:51:25.851 --> 00:51:28.430
Are those the two hubs?
Big epicenters?
Yeah.

846
00:51:28.431 --> 00:51:31.610
I mean you go in New York and there'll be a line up and you're like,
whoa.

847
00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:34.900
You know what I mean?
I looked at the standard line up.

848
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:39.680
It was Depaulo when Ari,
a bunch of other fucking killers.

849
00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:43.040
It's like you're getting this like in these two places especially,

850
00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:47.270
and other states can do it.
You know,
like Boston of course used to have,

851
00:51:47.271 --> 00:51:48.880
it doesn't really have it anymore,

852
00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:53.780
but it could come back or books come back be fucking when they had all those

853
00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:58.260
Roger Sinden tingle and monsters.
Gavin and Lenny and,

854
00:51:58.270 --> 00:52:01.880
and uh,
you know,
what's his name?
Kevin Knox.
Oh,

855
00:52:01.881 --> 00:52:06.770
you mean Barry Crimmins looking monster murder.
Murder row.

856
00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:11.090
Steve Sweeney monsters.
Don Gavin months sweet.
I've never seen somebody killed.

857
00:52:11.091 --> 00:52:14.480
Like I've seen Gavin and Sweeney kill back there or Roger sent back.

858
00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:18.450
Those people don't know.
They weren't there back then.
Those guys,
man,
they,

859
00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:22.550
there was a new existed in a bubble and they never left.
They never left town.

860
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:24.650
And because they never left town,
they fucked themselves.

861
00:52:24.651 --> 00:52:26.690
They never developed a draw on the road.
They never,

862
00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:30.620
you got to go to a place and you got to go to a place once and then he got to

863
00:52:30.621 --> 00:52:33.830
come.
Then people go,
oh,
rich vos is back.
And then again,

864
00:52:33.831 --> 00:52:37.370
and it takes fucking years to develop a crowd.
Well,

865
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:40.970
all show to those guys in Boston made so much fucking money.

866
00:52:40.971 --> 00:52:44.000
They didn't have to leave to get paid and coke.
They were,

867
00:52:44.330 --> 00:52:47.090
I was doing coke packet when I used to go up there and that was part of the

868
00:52:47.091 --> 00:52:50.610
problem there.
There was a lot of coke up there.
There was a lot of fucking coke.

869
00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:52.460
That's hard to get paid and coke and Oregon.

870
00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:56.540
What am I doing here with this check?
I did a fucking,
uh,
I did a show,

871
00:52:56.750 --> 00:53:00.800
a show at a one night or in Scranton.
It was me and Sandler.

872
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:04.080
He was Medellin and I was a one night or,
and uh,

873
00:53:04.350 --> 00:53:08.660
the owner took us into back and you know,
I guess he was getting 70,

874
00:53:08.661 --> 00:53:12.310
and then maybe I was getting 90 or 68,
whatever.
Right.

875
00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:15.080
Show the owner pulls out just fucking right.
I mean,

876
00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:19.070
and says you guys want any token Shay or money.
And I had and said,
no.
I said,

877
00:53:19.490 --> 00:53:22.410
fuck yeah,
right.
I probably got two and a half ago,

878
00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:25.950
I got double the money,
the in coke

879
00:53:26.050 --> 00:53:30.270
<v 2>at,
you know,
at least cause she would go sell a coke or just do it.
Did I sell it?</v>

880
00:53:30.271 --> 00:53:32.250
I had intentions to sell it.

881
00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:41.010
Yes,
like all the other times I had big,
big bags of coke,

882
00:53:41.790 --> 00:53:45.890
coke.
Did you ever take coke and cut it with like,
yeah,
I had.

883
00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:49.110
What I do is tie.
Oh Man,
this is,
I told you this story.

884
00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:54.380
This dude came up from Florida front of ours and he brought three ounces.

885
00:53:55.590 --> 00:53:59.520
I'm talking fucking some of the best coke ever.

886
00:53:59.550 --> 00:54:04.490
How big is an ounce of coke?
It's 28 grams.
No.
Is it like a six,

887
00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:08.550
eight years?
It was,
no,
it's 28 1660 ounces a pound.

888
00:54:08.551 --> 00:54:13.350
How many ounces is 20 it's
28 grams is okay.

889
00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:16.680
It's 2021 grams of that movie where they say the soul.

890
00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:23.400
Okay.
I might make a mistake on words.

891
00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:28.580
You don't know Graham metrics system or you can tell him sooner.

892
00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:33.540
What is it?
Okay,
so it was 20 I meant what does it look like?
But what does the,

893
00:54:33.541 --> 00:54:38.370
I guess maybe this month
and he pulls that much coke.
No,
I don't know.

894
00:54:38.371 --> 00:54:42.110
It's like a bag,
you know she's doing in between your fingers.
Oh,
okay.

895
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:45.200
Oh that much.
Yeah.
That's a lot.
That seems like a lot.
Yeah.

896
00:54:45.201 --> 00:54:45.930
It's like an eight ball,
right?

897
00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:49.720
Are you talking about 28 and eight announce or an April?
What's anything?

898
00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:54.320
It's three and a half grand.
Oh wait,
three and a half grams.
What did,

899
00:54:54.350 --> 00:54:59.310
what are you showing us,
Jamie?
Which ones announced on your point of reference?

900
00:54:59.311 --> 00:55:01.980
Yeah.
No,
that's not,
that's a quarter.
What does that thing on the scale,

901
00:55:01.981 --> 00:55:06.120
what does it say on the scale?
The far right.
Far Right.
What does that say?

902
00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:13.740
Two ounces.
Anyhow,
there we go.
So do I.
You asked if I could go.
Wow.
That's a lot.

903
00:55:13.741 --> 00:55:17.400
It's a lot.
That's amazing.
Okay,
so you had two ounces of coke.

904
00:55:17.401 --> 00:55:22.290
Now my friend came up with three ounces,
three ounces of two or three hours.

905
00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:26.230
I mean,
fucking is,
it's good as you can get.
Uh,

906
00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:27.890
and my mother was gone for a weekend.

907
00:55:27.930 --> 00:55:30.840
Somehow we were in my building and people are,

908
00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:33.690
we're selling coke like it's crazy.
Right?

909
00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:37.430
And smoking it just fucking free base and,
and cooking.

910
00:55:37.431 --> 00:55:41.290
And He fell asleep.
He fell asleep.
And I,
you know,

911
00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:43.350
I can tell you a couple of stories.
I'll tell you.

912
00:55:43.590 --> 00:55:44.880
I'll tell you two other ones are funny.

913
00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:47.580
He fell asleep and I took his fucking coke.

914
00:55:51.110 --> 00:55:51.270
No,

915
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:55.980
I pulled it out from under that we had and I took three and a half and eight out

916
00:55:55.981 --> 00:55:59.190
and I put an eighth of lactose in which you can't even tell the difference.

917
00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:02.860
This coke was so strong and you know I took like three and a half grams it has.

918
00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:06.030
But here's the fun.
Two funny stories.

919
00:56:06.070 --> 00:56:10.200
One time my friend said,
get me an eight to coke,

920
00:56:10.201 --> 00:56:14.600
three and a half grams and stick it under my door and you can have a half a
gram,

921
00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:15.473
whatever.

922
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:20.750
So I left three grams under his door while I did it.

923
00:56:21.331 --> 00:56:24.640
I went back,
smoked my half A.
I said,
hey.
And I,

924
00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:29.470
I went back to his place and I took a hangar and I pulled it back out.

925
00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:32.610
I made about five trips there

926
00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:37.990
at the end.
It was just lactose.
Okay,
so now,

927
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:44.680
so now here's another story.
This fucking Guy John,
I was under road doing comedy.

928
00:56:44.681 --> 00:56:46.830
He hasn't seen me.
He goes,
look man,
I haven't seen a woman.

929
00:56:47.110 --> 00:56:51.040
I'm going to buy an eighth or coke.
Okay,
so that's three and a half grams.

930
00:56:52.330 --> 00:56:57.010
It cost him $250,
right?
He goes,
we're going to do a gram,

931
00:56:57.610 --> 00:57:02.230
which leaves two and a half grams left.
Uh,
that helps sell for a hundred,

932
00:57:02.231 --> 00:57:05.560
150 but he actually cut it in five half grams.

933
00:57:05.770 --> 00:57:09.700
That'll sell 55 half grams to get us 250 back.

934
00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:13.900
And we have a gram that will smoke together.
He goes,
I senior,
I'll smoke.

935
00:57:13.901 --> 00:57:15.170
So we smoked a Graham,

936
00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:18.700
there's two and a half grams left that he's going to sell to get his money back.

937
00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:21.850
He falls asleep.
Okay.

938
00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:26.290
I don't know how I found out where he hit it,
so I would,
okay.

939
00:57:26.291 --> 00:57:29.650
I would go in his fuck where he hit it and take a half a gram out.

940
00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:35.050
Did I would drive to the store and buy a pneumonia,

941
00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:40.060
ammonia ammonia,
is it ammonia or pneumonia?

942
00:57:40.061 --> 00:57:42.040
I don't want to fuck this up.
Ammonia.

943
00:57:43.810 --> 00:57:47.110
And he had to be clear and I would cook it.
There's a way to cook it.

944
00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:52.450
So I go there,
I buy a bottle,
come back,
cook a half a gram,
smoke it,

945
00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:57.130
pour out all the ammonia,
right?
And I'm no fucking,
and now I can eat.

946
00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:02.950
You can make crack.
You can make freebase with him.
All right,
so I fucking,
I took,

947
00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:06.050
I took off.
He says his first,
the first half,
agree with them.

948
00:58:06.051 --> 00:58:09.520
Rene's or in business.
His first half crab,
I went to the store,

949
00:58:09.521 --> 00:58:11.590
bought the ammonia,
cooked the half a gram,

950
00:58:11.830 --> 00:58:16.830
poured the ammonia out so I wouldn't steal anymore and fucking smoked it.

951
00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:22.120
I can't stop
fucking I'm backups.

952
00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:27.010
I made five trips to the convenience store,
bonding among

953
00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:33.250
right.
And I'm so fucking whacked out and fucked up and all the guys go,

954
00:58:33.251 --> 00:58:35.770
why does this guy keep coming in every hour?
But I go,
look,

955
00:58:35.771 --> 00:58:38.470
I got a cleaning business right just to use.

956
00:58:38.471 --> 00:58:43.330
A lot of them are so all of a sudden he wakes up and I hear,
I hear now,

957
00:58:43.331 --> 00:58:47.240
I'm no coke left.
I'm drinking pure straight vocat to try.

958
00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:51.670
And all I hear is a big fuck him yelling upstairs.

959
00:58:52.330 --> 00:58:55.150
Where's Mike?
He came down,
where's my coke?
I go,
look,
don't worry.

960
00:58:55.151 --> 00:58:59.710
I sold it for you while you were sleeping on credit to this guy.
I stole.

961
00:58:59.711 --> 00:59:03.280
I paid him back but I just stole it.
I was a scumbag.

962
00:59:03.730 --> 00:59:05.920
I was a drug addict.
That's a lot of cocaine.

963
00:59:05.921 --> 00:59:10.170
You were doing the vodka to calm your body down because you're all whacked out.

964
00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:10.910
I was so funny.

965
00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:15.910
I had a and then and there was nothing worse than when sun up sun up.

966
00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:21.800
I'm walking home
all fucking coming down.

967
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:26.880
No one,
I have no money.
Nothing.
It was the worst fucking it.

968
00:59:27.290 --> 00:59:32.120
It was the worst life on the plan.
It was such a bad life,
you know?

969
00:59:32.121 --> 00:59:36.440
And then the running would,
you know in to New York,

970
00:59:36.441 --> 00:59:40.460
what is it most feel like that you have to drink vodka.
Like what?
What is like,

971
00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:44.090
you're just so calm.
Your body down,
you're just going to explode.

972
00:59:45.110 --> 00:59:49.610
It's like being really high on caffeine and then alcohol kind of takes you down

973
00:59:49.611 --> 00:59:54.470
a few notches.
Like slows you down.
It counteracts it.
Yeah.
It's just,

974
00:59:54.471 --> 00:59:57.740
I don't know.
You never snorted coke.
He never did coke.
And you're like,
no,

975
00:59:57.860 --> 01:00:02.050
get out of here.
Really?
No,
no.
Did it.
Oh Wow.
Have you done coke?
Oh,
of course.
Yeah.

976
01:00:02.330 --> 01:00:06.710
No saw way too many people just lose their,
lose their shit.

977
01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:08.300
Did you do snow?
You ever smoke it?

978
01:00:09.050 --> 01:00:13.490
So you know how fucking the rush and the problem is,

979
01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:17.720
and it's not,
I'm not glorifying smoking.
It gives you more of a rush.
Kidding me.

980
01:00:17.830 --> 01:00:21.740
I didn't think that smoking it.
That's where you just like,
oh,

981
01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:23.540
heart pounding clean.

982
01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:29.020
It's a rush that you'll never ever the first one.

983
01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:31.700
You'll won't repeat it till maybe a day later.

984
01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:36.380
So you keep trying to chase that fucking debt.
First hit my friend Johnny.

985
01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:39.260
This is back when we,
when I lived in New York,
it was the real time square.

986
01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:41.750
Like Times Square was a real thing.
Like you go to Times Square,

987
01:00:41.751 --> 01:00:45.050
there was Pete boots,
it was dirty.
It was a dangerous spot.
He would go,

988
01:00:45.051 --> 01:00:48.800
he would smoke crack and he'd go to Times Square and you go to those peep booths

989
01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:52.310
and he would,
uh,
he would beat off in these people who was like forever.

990
01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:55.010
And he goes,
you didn't even come.
He just just kept playing with yourself.

991
01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:59.960
But you just kept watching porn and watching girls like finger themselves in

992
01:00:59.961 --> 01:01:03.050
front.
And he go and I go,
what?
They look like.
They were fucking disgusting.

993
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:06.650
It didn't matter.
It was just that it was deviant.
You would just do it.

994
01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:08.630
It's like for whatever reason,

995
01:01:08.631 --> 01:01:12.440
the smoking crack made them just want to do dirty shit.
Just do,

996
01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.350
just be a dirty naughty person.
You know?

997
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:19.100
I was smoking so much one night and like did shriveled up so much.
I couldn't,

998
01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:21.260
and I look at my pants,
I was so fucking,
I couldn't,

999
01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:25.930
I thought it went into my body.
I feel like I lost it completely sucked

1000
01:01:27.590 --> 01:01:31.700
and I'm gone.
And Coke.
Yeah,
well you took Calc II.
Yeah.

1001
01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:36.210
And if I don't like,
like I was so fucked up,
I go,
is it,
oh,

1002
01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:37.820
I'll deal with it later.
I'm going to get high.

1003
01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:42.740
But I thought my fucking Dick was him.
We used to go to this fucking people.

1004
01:01:42.741 --> 01:01:46.490
It was funny,
one night,
God,
I think we've told the story on the ONA,

1005
01:01:46.491 --> 01:01:51.491
but like in Philly to which these fucking people's on the way home from Philly

1006
01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:58.540
and you'd go in and you would pay a girl to watch you Kericho off.

1007
01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:04.640
Right.
And she would like,
she's now couldn't touch you,

1008
01:02:04.641 --> 01:02:09.020
but she wants to maybe go,
ah,
Ooh,
you know,
uh,
you know,

1009
01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:11.000
but you've got to do it in front of somebody.

1010
01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:14.450
So it was fucking great.

1011
01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:20.070
Don't look at it.
Me Is so exciting.

1012
01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:23.850
So one time,
I mean,
Norton and all of us used to go,

1013
01:02:23.851 --> 01:02:28.560
but one time it was me,
Levy and Florentine.

1014
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:31.700
So Florentines,
Jim,

1015
01:02:31.710 --> 01:02:36.710
Florence and Bob Bob's who Florentines in the booth first in one at a Boosie and

1016
01:02:38.461 --> 01:02:39.840
he's on,
all of a sudden,
I swear to God,

1017
01:02:39.841 --> 01:02:44.520
you hear over the loudspeaker mop to booth for right to fucking clean up his

1018
01:02:44.521 --> 01:02:48.130
jazz.
And then,
and then you find out your buddies,

1019
01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:53.010
the booth for like,
so no,
they fucking Levy.

1020
01:02:53.130 --> 01:02:57.390
Now there's curtains on the door,
you know there's a shade,

1021
01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:59.280
but there's this much space.

1022
01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:04.940
So Levy's in the room where we could see the shadow of a fucking hand flying

1023
01:03:05.131 --> 01:03:06.720
back and forth,
right?

1024
01:03:06.810 --> 01:03:11.810
We can see the shackle of his hand jerking himself off fucking clue or under the

1025
01:03:12.811 --> 01:03:16.200
chain.
And this hand was moving fucking fast.

1026
01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:20.300
I've never seen somebody Jared off that fucking ass.

1027
01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:22.290
How many times he's seen guys jerk off

1028
01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:26.490
and my database,

1029
01:03:27.450 --> 01:03:31.380
most of over a lifetime of observing how well,
you know,
I said judge,

1030
01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:36.620
I study and then one time we went in there and meet Norton and I got kicked out

1031
01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:40.800
cause I was trying to negotiate with the girl.
I go,
look,
what the fuck?

1032
01:03:40.810 --> 01:03:44.270
Just take $15 what the fuck?
You know,
I'm,

1033
01:03:44.550 --> 01:03:46.530
you don't have to do nothing but sit in and watch.

1034
01:03:46.650 --> 01:03:50.220
We'll they supposed to take 25 and that was a lot of money back then.

1035
01:03:50.221 --> 01:03:54.720
You have to these one nighters.
I go take 15 and I got kicked out,

1036
01:03:54.810 --> 01:03:58.020
keep negotiating.
Sometimes I got him down,

1037
01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:01.170
but I got kicked out and fucking Norton walks out the car and goes,

1038
01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:05.100
how could you possibly get kicked out of a peep booths?

1039
01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:06.810
How can you get kicked out of up?

1040
01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:11.340
How fucked up is your life that you got kicked out of a peep booths and this is,

1041
01:04:11.341 --> 01:04:15.780
Norton was totally sober back then.
Like we were all born.
Well Norton was,

1042
01:04:15.810 --> 01:04:18.780
he only did drunk.
So there was like 18 or something like that.
Yeah,

1043
01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:22.380
he got sober like really young.
It's kind of crazy.
Think about it.

1044
01:04:22.381 --> 01:04:26.670
Like you realize that I can't do,
I can't do this anymore.
He was fucked up.

1045
01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:30.400
Did you ever hear the central park story with me in northern?
No.
Oh,

1046
01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:35.490
this is a class
the side.
Can we go,

1047
01:04:35.491 --> 01:04:39.060
he told this story to crack my fingers.
Okay.
We,
uh,

1048
01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:45.450
we're coming out of somewhere,
maybe a 12 step meeting or whatever,
you know,
so,

1049
01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:47.460
and there's hot,

1050
01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:51.330
hot black chick walks by and recognizes me from,

1051
01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:53.910
and I wasn't even maybe from a cop.
I didn't,

1052
01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:58.200
maybe I did one TV show or two when my life,
so I shipped to her,

1053
01:04:58.201 --> 01:05:01.710
do you want to go out for,
for Bagels,
were going for bagels.
She said,
okay.

1054
01:05:01.711 --> 01:05:04.080
So we went ahead bagels.
Then we said,
hey,

1055
01:05:04.081 --> 01:05:08.910
we're going to go uptown to the Pete Boosie,
you know,
on like 54th whatever.

1056
01:05:08.911 --> 01:05:12.780
Broad look.
Go look.
I'm not trying to judge a prostitute.

1057
01:05:12.810 --> 01:05:15.870
I'm not fucking judging people.
We're not here to judge.
But I mean,

1058
01:05:15.871 --> 01:05:18.540
did you know she was a prostitute?
She wasn't a prostitute,

1059
01:05:18.550 --> 01:05:22.510
but use a fighter to a Pete booth.
Yeah,
we are.
She's already likes us.
We got go.

1060
01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:28.030
She gotta fuck you already got her.
She already got a fucking free Bagel south.

1061
01:05:28.070 --> 01:05:32.590
We're not thinking this is going to be a girlfriend someday.
No,
no,
no.

1062
01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:37.720
But you got to,
so it's hilarious.
So we go,
hey,
we're gone.
We were planning on it.

1063
01:05:37.721 --> 01:05:38.950
I mean,
ordering up there.
Anyhow,

1064
01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.000
so we go up to the quarter moon to people and she comes into a booth when me

1065
01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:50.890
and,
but we get kicked out the fucking Indian fucking get out,
you know?
No couple,

1066
01:05:51.310 --> 01:05:54.580
no scalpel,
no couple's into booth in those quarter boots.

1067
01:05:54.581 --> 01:05:59.290
You can't bring somebody in.
So now there's just no fucking lie.
I'm not lying.

1068
01:05:59.530 --> 01:06:04.060
We're standing right across from the Ed Sullivan Theater.

1069
01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:07.510
Right.
And there's like a,

1070
01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:12.640
a newspaper Kiosk and we're leaning on a car and I'm making out with her and,

1071
01:06:13.030 --> 01:06:16.870
and,
and,
and I'm fingering her on Broadway.

1072
01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:22.000
So she fucking and nortons just grabbing her ass like a little fucking like,

1073
01:06:22.001 --> 01:06:25.450
he's like,
it's a toy.
He's playing with her.
Right.

1074
01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:28.680
So I faint and she comes right.

1075
01:06:28.690 --> 01:06:30.850
She has an orgasm standing on Broadway from briefing.

1076
01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:35.290
So then we'd get in the car,
we go,
hey,
Julian has an orgasm.
Who Does?
Allegedly,

1077
01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:38.470
no,
I had no idea to tell.
You could feel it.
Hunter.

1078
01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:40.940
Well she didn't piss on my finger,
but you can,

1079
01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:44.520
but you can tell when a goal is hazard.
If she wasn't faking it,

1080
01:06:44.530 --> 01:06:47.520
she wasn't in a Raj.
Okay.
Sell was in Hawaii.

1081
01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:50.940
Now I'm not saying it was the best one that Sean has been tardy.

1082
01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:51.940
You're fingering her.
She said,
no,

1083
01:06:51.970 --> 01:06:55.300
I didn't know my stubby little fingers know what they're doing.
Okay,

1084
01:06:55.301 --> 01:06:56.920
but you're being Nikki negative.
This is

1085
01:06:59.070 --> 01:07:02.670
just trying to get a real clear picture of what actually happened.
Okay.

1086
01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:05.310
Could it be any clearer?
You're fingering her.

1087
01:07:05.350 --> 01:07:07.450
That must have looked like a site also,
by the way.

1088
01:07:07.470 --> 01:07:10.990
Just talk back and they heard in the middle and then Norton grabbing the bud.

1089
01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:14.170
Yeah,
it'll confirm all of that.
So then we go,

1090
01:07:14.171 --> 01:07:17.260
let's take a ride up to central park and we were walking through central park

1091
01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:22.150
and then she's blowing me,
right.

1092
01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:27.190
She's blowing me.
And,
and then I looked down and I,

1093
01:07:27.191 --> 01:07:29.200
she Norton eating her ass

1094
01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:34.540
little kid in candy.
Right.

1095
01:07:34.810 --> 01:07:37.840
And I'm trying not to crack up because I'm fucking blown.

1096
01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:41.150
You don't want to fucking laugh as you getting blown.
Right.
You know?

1097
01:07:41.170 --> 01:07:44.890
But this has got to feel good for her.
She's getting her assay and,
and,

1098
01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:49.570
and now I'm getting blown.
So I shoot a load,

1099
01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:53.470
we get back in the car and we're driving and I,

1100
01:07:53.490 --> 01:07:57.700
I go to north and you have a good time.
He goes,
wow.
I was a little uncomfortable.

1101
01:07:57.701 --> 01:08:02.500
I got my,
my,
my pants dirty.
I go,
you'll fucking eat out.

1102
01:08:02.530 --> 01:08:06.710
A strange girls,
they ass,
but you're worried about getting your fucking pants.

1103
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:08.740
What are you going to get home?
Your mom's going to say,

1104
01:08:08.741 --> 01:08:11.850
look at these grass stains.
Were you eating out?
Asked again.

1105
01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:16.700
It like he was upset that he grass stains on his pants.

1106
01:08:16.890 --> 01:08:20.960
I,
she was eating fucking strange girl.
So hilarious.

1107
01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:25.820
That's so,
sounds like Norton too.
It's so ridiculous.
We,
I mean this is,

1108
01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:29.450
I was obviously single and young weekish so fuck,
you know,
he,

1109
01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:34.700
I was dating this girl that was so fucking hot and we're in a car and she was

1110
01:08:34.701 --> 01:08:38.570
blowing in,
Norton was walking by.
I go,
hey,
you want to watch?
And he,
he goes,
yeah,

1111
01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:41.960
he comes in and he's in the back of the car.
She didn't cause he's just fucking,

1112
01:08:42.230 --> 01:08:46.250
you know,
we picked up this fucking jerking off.
She calls,
she's blown.
Yeah.

1113
01:08:46.251 --> 01:08:49.120
But I come so quick,
he goes,
fuck man.
Hole off.
Uh,

1114
01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:56.150
so
one time we pick up this hottie I pick out,
it's always made picker.

1115
01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:57.870
I picked up,
just go off onto the commie.

1116
01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:01.220
I'm fucking so we're going back to Norton's house

1117
01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:04.460
and she's blowing me.

1118
01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:07.670
And whatever and nortons Turk and off and next thing you know,

1119
01:09:07.671 --> 01:09:12.671
I see a load fly and hit Norton in the fucking head from you.

1120
01:09:12.921 --> 01:09:16.670
Like he fucking blowing me.
He,
he jerked and a fucking,

1121
01:09:16.850 --> 01:09:18.200
I don't know why it gets so,
yeah,

1122
01:09:18.201 --> 01:09:21.860
he hit himself in the head and I was so fucking impressed that as soon as that

1123
01:09:21.861 --> 01:09:26.420
high and hit himself and then I was like,
it was fucking very impressive.
Okay.

1124
01:09:26.890 --> 01:09:31.620
John,
he's a creep.
What about you?

1125
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.380
I'm not,
I'm just getting blown.

1126
01:09:33.381 --> 01:09:37.130
I didn't do anything DVN I didn't do anything wrong.

1127
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:42.890
He's so honest about his perversions.
It's hilarious.

1128
01:09:42.891 --> 01:09:45.110
I was there ever been a guard on the radio?

1129
01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:48.140
That's is is honest about its perversions as Norton.

1130
01:09:48.330 --> 01:09:51.440
I don't even think there's a close second.
No,

1131
01:09:51.830 --> 01:09:56.830
no one like a regular radio guy that's as honest about being a pervert and

1132
01:09:56.841 --> 01:10:00.950
trannies and all the crazy shit that Norton does.
I mean,
that's very unique that,

1133
01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:02.810
you know.
Yeah.

1134
01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:07.940
I think opie and Anthony when they were together brought really w we're good to

1135
01:10:08.901 --> 01:10:13.490
get the truth out of all of us from Tollin to fucking Bobby.
I mean,

1136
01:10:13.491 --> 01:10:16.160
we spilled our guts and Patrice,
Patrice,

1137
01:10:16.190 --> 01:10:20.480
I mean really have told stories that,
you know,

1138
01:10:20.481 --> 01:10:24.560
I mean that are like really fucking deep about our parents and upbringing,

1139
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:27.870
you know.
Uh,
and that's what people think.
They know it.

1140
01:10:27.871 --> 01:10:31.430
That's why I hate fucking somebody guys on Twitter.
They,
they think they're just,

1141
01:10:31.431 --> 01:10:34.130
cause we,
you're not my friend.
Don't ever,
you know,

1142
01:10:34.131 --> 01:10:35.840
so you can't say that things Norton and,

1143
01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:41.060
and Bobby and Patrice and whatever [inaudible] say to me,
that's why they think,

1144
01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:44.870
but Chris,
they got so they know so much about our lives,

1145
01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:48.800
but Norton brings you to a whole nother level.
Like you say,
like,

1146
01:10:48.890 --> 01:10:52.670
you know what I mean?
Like,
uh,
you know,

1147
01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:57.810
had I known,
you know what I mean?
I did get,
we'll even thinking about it.

1148
01:10:58.270 --> 01:11:03.090
Cause it's lucky it every,
you know,
every,
uh,

1149
01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:04.071
there's nobody.

1150
01:11:04.071 --> 01:11:08.270
Like Norton Norton is a completely unique individual and always has been,

1151
01:11:08.650 --> 01:11:13.410
you know,
always husband.
He's just,
we just found his voice more as a comic,

1152
01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:17.300
you know,
now than ever before.
But he's always been this like really unique guy.

1153
01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:22.260
Well,
I,
I can tell you what he does.
I don't watch a lot of comics stand up.

1154
01:11:22.261 --> 01:11:25.980
I just don't watch a lot.
Once in a blue moon,
I'll see a little of this,

1155
01:11:25.981 --> 01:11:30.660
a little of that.
But on radio,
there was no one quicker.

1156
01:11:30.661 --> 01:11:34.410
I come back then Norton,
no,
no,
no.
Hands down.
He is,

1157
01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:39.510
he's my favorite all time radio personality.
He is,
uh,
he's in,

1158
01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:40.660
he,
uh,
he's in,

1159
01:11:41.070 --> 01:11:45.330
I know him as a f I'm just saying he's quick as fuck.
Oh radio.

1160
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:48.840
He's in his class by himself.
But that also too,

1161
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:51.260
when you're going in there,
you know,

1162
01:11:51.261 --> 01:11:55.160
if Collins in and Bobby and me and when Patrice was there,

1163
01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:58.630
your go walking into the lion's den,
you gotta be,
you know,
boom.

1164
01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:00.420
There's no fucking,

1165
01:12:00.690 --> 01:12:04.980
I mean we will just tear fucking Patrice.

1166
01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:10.410
And he laid into me.
He first,

1167
01:12:10.411 --> 01:12:14.760
he attacked my,
I had a Rolex,
somehow he attacked me having a Rolex.

1168
01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:19.510
Okay.
Cause it wasn't a brightening.
It was a Rolex where I bought a frog.
Brian,

1169
01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:24.150
I can get a deal Rolex to him it was,
he's,
you know,
black guys don't,
you know,

1170
01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:29.100
they liked those big fucking,
you know,
then he attacked me.
He attacked me,

1171
01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:34.700
you know what I'm saying,
from acids to watch this.
So Denny,
he attack.

1172
01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:38.790
I had,
I was driving at the time a Porsche Boxster,
right?

1173
01:12:39.090 --> 01:12:42.660
A dumb,
and he had a,
I think a cattle escalate or whatever,

1174
01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:45.000
and he was calling me selfish.

1175
01:12:45.570 --> 01:12:50.340
So I'm driving this little car and he's killing me and I,

1176
01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:54.360
and I'm driving home from Ona and I can't let,
I'm going,
wait,

1177
01:12:54.361 --> 01:12:58.560
you fucking fat.
Fuck,
you're driving to escalate.
That's fucking,

1178
01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:04.240
uh,
you know,
using all this gas,
all this,
you know,

1179
01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:06.110
you know,
I'm not just,

1180
01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:11.070
you're the selfish one because you could not stop eating fucking fruitcakes and

1181
01:13:11.071 --> 01:13:15.900
now so,
and then he's saying how crappy my car,
two days later,

1182
01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:21.030
I,
I'm online looking at the price of a Boxster new against his car,

1183
01:13:21.031 --> 01:13:22.290
new and all the stats.

1184
01:13:22.590 --> 01:13:27.170
And I fucking email it to him because he calls me cracking up.
It's,

1185
01:13:27.171 --> 01:13:31.560
so he goes,
you're still thinking about this.
You're still thinking about this.

1186
01:13:32.010 --> 01:13:35.430
I walked out of studio,
I forgot it was,
it was radio,

1187
01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:38.610
but it was,
he fucked with you.

1188
01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:42.780
He fucking rip me down so hard and I quit and he,

1189
01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:47.370
he was overpowered.
Patrice was an and power and guy.
We,
even if you were right,

1190
01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:48.750
you couldn't,

1191
01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:53.280
he just does so verbally overpower.

1192
01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:57.600
You know how big he would be today if he was a cop as a combo,
he'd be,

1193
01:13:57.601 --> 01:13:59.430
he's hands down would be,

1194
01:13:59.790 --> 01:14:02.820
he'd be right up there with anybody or done any of the biggest comics in the

1195
01:14:02.821 --> 01:14:05.610
world today as talent was.

1196
01:14:05.950 --> 01:14:10.950
He did sabotage a lot because,
well,
not,
no,
he didn't,
not,
I'm wrong.
He didn't,

1197
01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:15.320
he knew what he wanted.
He turned down a lot.
He didn't sabotage it.

1198
01:14:15.330 --> 01:14:17.800
W what kind of stuff that he turned down?
Well,
I mean,
you know,

1199
01:14:17.801 --> 01:14:21.790
Spike Lee liked him,
but I guess the money wasn't right what he was offered,

1200
01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:22.620
you know,

1201
01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:27.620
for a movie or for whatever to do whatever would spike day when,

1202
01:14:28.331 --> 01:14:32.400
when puffy had that show on,
uh,
uh,

1203
01:14:32.530 --> 01:14:36.970
Hbo,
whatever.
It wasn't Deb Cam was another black comic thing.

1204
01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:41.770
They asked him to host it and he,
I,
he didn't like the deal.
He turned it down.

1205
01:14:42.250 --> 01:14:44.200
Uh,
when he had VH one,

1206
01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:48.310
I think he wanted his own billboard in Times Square and some more,
you know,

1207
01:14:48.311 --> 01:14:52.840
whatever.
Well he deserved it.
He deserved and they said No.

1208
01:14:52.841 --> 01:14:55.650
So I was like,
fuck you then.
But whatever he was offered,

1209
01:14:55.750 --> 01:15:00.130
but he knew what he wanted.
He was offered many rows before he did that.
Uh,

1210
01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:02.740
Charlie Sheen one and he was right.
He's going,

1211
01:15:02.741 --> 01:15:07.741
why am I going to do a fucking roast with DC comics that aren't in my league and

1212
01:15:08.501 --> 01:15:09.790
are not my friends?

1213
01:15:10.150 --> 01:15:15.010
Well he wasn't either talking about who's the best at that road.
He's like,

1214
01:15:15.011 --> 01:15:18.790
who are they going?
Who was named Charlie Sheen?
Was that the most?
And,
and,

1215
01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:21.070
and just on that can we're on it.

1216
01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:26.080
And he murdered and he let me tell you,
he went last and a lot of that with this,

1217
01:15:26.590 --> 01:15:30.730
that was ad,
cause I went over a lot of his stuff before we taught.

1218
01:15:30.731 --> 01:15:32.940
You know what I mean?
So I go and,

1219
01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:36.400
and stuff was hit and then he started getting mad because you're talking about

1220
01:15:36.401 --> 01:15:40.330
his diabetes and he's like,
what the fuck?
It ain't or talk about me like this.

1221
01:15:40.810 --> 01:15:44.290
You know?
And that was his whole mindset before you even going into the roast.

1222
01:15:44.530 --> 01:15:48.460
So they multiply the by saying shit about,
cause he goes,

1223
01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:50.530
they're not my fucking friends.
They don't,
you know what I mean?

1224
01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:55.120
And he clearly stole that roast.

1225
01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:58.690
Clearly hands down would a fucking from there,

1226
01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:03.870
there would've been no stopping Patrice.
None so sad.
You know,
it's,

1227
01:16:03.970 --> 01:16:07.960
it's so fucked up that some of the funniest guys have all these self sabotaging

1228
01:16:07.961 --> 01:16:12.961
traits like bad diet drugs not taking care of themselves as so,

1229
01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:15.640
so,
so,
so,
so fucking sad.

1230
01:16:17.650 --> 01:16:22.240
But he was a baby.
I know he wasn't a drug addict.
He didn't drink.

1231
01:16:22.241 --> 01:16:24.930
He didn't do,
was body,
didn't take care of his dying to me.

1232
01:16:24.931 --> 01:16:26.740
I'd fucking diabetes and take care of it.

1233
01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:30.370
He thought he died from something that other people haven't died from.
I mean,

1234
01:16:30.371 --> 01:16:33.700
if he just lost weight and eat healthy and started eating vegetables,

1235
01:16:33.710 --> 01:16:35.180
could have lowered his blood sugar.
Are,

1236
01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:37.660
you could have dealt with it in a healthy way,
but,

1237
01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:40.810
but what makes a guy that fucking funny?

1238
01:16:40.811 --> 01:16:44.050
It's kind of the same shit that I don't give a fuck attitude.

1239
01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:47.580
You can't have that.
I don't give a fuck attitude and be,
you know,

1240
01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:51.320
drinking green tea instead of eating cheeseburgers.
You know?
It's like,

1241
01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:56.010
it comes with the lifestyle.
It's a lifestyle.
He,
she,

1242
01:16:56.011 --> 01:16:58.730
there's con,
there's comics that,

1243
01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:02.710
that do comedy from their head and their funders,
funny guy,

1244
01:17:03.670 --> 01:17:04.503
he came from,

1245
01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:09.380
to me the best comics on the planet are comics or talk from their heart that

1246
01:17:09.381 --> 01:17:10.100
talk from

1247
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:13.850
<v 0>within them.
You know what I mean?
You're not,
they didn't figure it out.</v>

1248
01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:17.090
They lived it or they experienced it.
You know what I'm saying?

1249
01:17:18.170 --> 01:17:21.740
So Patrice wasn't,
he was brilliant.
He had to think of it,

1250
01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:25.250
but it really came from here.
This was how he,

1251
01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:29.660
he was in real life that,
you know,
he didn't go on stage and hey,

1252
01:17:29.661 --> 01:17:34.160
let me do my fucking act.
Right.
You know,
and a good comic,
you know,
uh,
you know,

1253
01:17:34.161 --> 01:17:37.850
you take like Louie and Stan hope and,
and Voss.

1254
01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:39.710
You take guys like that.
You thought,

1255
01:17:39.711 --> 01:17:44.120
you know what he said in Ventura comedy club Friday this Friday to Sun,

1256
01:17:44.121 --> 01:17:47.620
California,
Ventura,
California,
Ventura harbor.
Holy Shit.
No,

1257
01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:50.810
but you see what I'm saying?
You taught,
you take these guys like Stan Hope,

1258
01:17:50.811 --> 01:17:55.160
I think is fucking a genius.
I think he's just at a whole nother level.

1259
01:17:55.490 --> 01:17:59.900
I read some of his blogs and just a guy who's awesome,
his fucking mind.

1260
01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:03.230
He said,
well,
he's really live in it.
You know what I mean?

1261
01:18:03.231 --> 01:18:06.020
Like Stan hope lives in Bisbee,

1262
01:18:06.021 --> 01:18:10.820
Arizona in the middle of fucking nowhere in a multicolored like bright orange

1263
01:18:10.821 --> 01:18:15.320
house,
uh,
or blood bright yellow house.
He has a Superbowl parties.

1264
01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:16.880
He invites the world,

1265
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.390
literally gives out his address on my podcast and it says,

1266
01:18:20.391 --> 01:18:24.590
come to my Superbowl party.
So he has hundreds of people.

1267
01:18:24.591 --> 01:18:29.591
He has no idea who they are flying in to Tucson then drive to Bisbee and show

1268
01:18:30.591 --> 01:18:30.691
up.

1269
01:18:30.691 --> 01:18:35.350
But it's fucking house and he lets them inside where he sleeps and eats and are

1270
01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:39.800
wander around and starts drinking smoking and he doesn't give a fuck you like,

1271
01:18:40.110 --> 01:18:42.680
like there's a lot of guys pretending to not give a fuck.
Yeah.

1272
01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:47.510
Stan hope is that guy,
you know,
wearing those ironic suits.
Oh.
And he's like,

1273
01:18:47.511 --> 01:18:51.080
I kind of have to stop wearing these because other people,
I think I'm serious.

1274
01:18:51.410 --> 01:18:55.460
You know like people like and now like wearing ironic close is become like

1275
01:18:55.670 --> 01:18:58.470
ironic suits is become like a thing that people can sit closer to.

1276
01:18:58.471 --> 01:19:01.730
Almost like a hipster thing.
I watched him at a show,

1277
01:19:01.731 --> 01:19:05.450
I think he was doing with Norton and Artie Lange and tell it Atlantic city we

1278
01:19:05.451 --> 01:19:09.890
went down to hang out.
I like,
it could have been a bright yellow fucking blazer.

1279
01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:14.800
Yeah.
You know,
I mean you would think he was going to introduce acrobats.
Okay.

1280
01:19:14.810 --> 01:19:17.890
Yeah.
We,
yeah,
that gives a burlesque emcees.

1281
01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:21.770
We did the end of the world show,
the December 21st,

1282
01:19:21.770 --> 01:19:25.010
2012 showed at the alternatives,
a honey honey,
Joe Diaz,

1283
01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:29.150
Stan hope and millions to tell,
pour this ridiculous suit.
It was just ridiculous.

1284
01:19:29.170 --> 01:19:32.600
Was half of what made it awesome.
It was him.
He was fucking stupid suit.

1285
01:19:33.570 --> 01:19:38.270
But his,
his mind like houses get a photo,
his house,
he's got look at his house.

1286
01:19:38.510 --> 01:19:41.750
I mean,
if anybody wants to visit Doug,
Stan hope you can't miss it.

1287
01:19:41.970 --> 01:19:45.320
Just drive through Bisbee of fighting in five seconds ago.
Oh,
there he is.

1288
01:19:45.321 --> 01:19:47.240
But what I also,
what I love about him,

1289
01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:53.900
he calls his own shots and there's business.
Oh,
you know what I mean?
And He,

1290
01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:59.000
I mean,
first guys to do these promotions where he was like,
you know,

1291
01:19:59.001 --> 01:20:02.240
I'm tired of working at these comedy clubs and they give me shit money and I

1292
01:20:02.241 --> 01:20:07.040
know how much I'm bringing in.
That's his house.
That's fucking,
that's his,

1293
01:20:07.450 --> 01:20:08.070
as his house.

1294
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:11.370
<v 3>That's what you want to see on the Internet to somebody made from a,
uh,</v>

1295
01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:14.410
from an x car.
Go,
uh,
uh,
you know,

1296
01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:19.050
pebbles instead of a lawn,
we'll get all these,
this is a,

1297
01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:22.210
this is just a bunch of people probably that's like a part,

1298
01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:26.590
probably a party that he,
that's a fuck halfway house.
So yeah,
that's cool party.

1299
01:20:27.210 --> 01:20:30.570
But I mean he has the Super Bowl parties and I dunno if all of them are photos.

1300
01:20:30.571 --> 01:20:33.150
There's other photos where there's even more pictures that looks like an x

1301
01:20:33.151 --> 01:20:36.780
storage bin.
Like one of those things that is podcast down there.

1302
01:20:36.781 --> 01:20:39.420
What does that scroll down a little,
because he has a podcast now.

1303
01:20:39.421 --> 01:20:44.200
Is that the studio?
Click on it.
Let me see that.
The one with the podcast.
Yeah.

1304
01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:49.290
Oh look at that.
They can go.
Who's that with him?

1305
01:20:49.950 --> 01:20:53.910
I said girl.
No,
the other Guy Quinn from impractical jokers.

1306
01:20:54.450 --> 01:20:57.660
So that's his,
he's got his own podcast studio now.
Good for him.

1307
01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:02.070
And that's all in,
in his wacky house.
I fucking,
he's a maniac.

1308
01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:05.630
I fucking love the fact that he takes like goes into rock,

1309
01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:08.350
does what he wants to do.
I love fucking Combo.

1310
01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:11.130
Do comedy clubs now because he's undeniable now.

1311
01:21:11.131 --> 01:21:14.830
They have to give him the door or whatever the fuck the deal is.
They do weekend,

1312
01:21:14.850 --> 01:21:17.760
he'll do a Tuesday,
Wednesday in a comedy club that wants to do a weekend.

1313
01:21:17.761 --> 01:21:18.870
I'll do what we can.
But it's,

1314
01:21:18.871 --> 01:21:22.560
it's one of those things where they were trying to tell him what he was worth

1315
01:21:22.561 --> 01:21:25.080
and he was like,
why am I giving you guys anything?

1316
01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:27.060
And I can just sound out a rock club.

1317
01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:31.770
The problem those rock clubs is we saw him once in La,
we went to see him in La.

1318
01:21:31.870 --> 01:21:35.010
You have to stand up.
It was a concrete floor.
You're standing.

1319
01:21:35.011 --> 01:21:37.440
And after like a half hour,
I was like,
this is the last,

1320
01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:40.890
I'm never going to do a standing room.
Cause I had done a few standing shows.

1321
01:21:40.891 --> 01:21:42.690
I'm like,
I'm never doing one of these ever again.

1322
01:21:44.130 --> 01:21:47.370
We went down to watch him and Philly do one of those things and it's kind of

1323
01:21:47.371 --> 01:21:52.200
uncomfortable standing Sally's bullshit.
Bullshit.
I mean,

1324
01:21:52.201 --> 01:21:57.130
hey stuff.
You got to talk into the microphone where had earphones your phone,

1325
01:21:57.300 --> 01:22:01.590
Mr. Microphone for one second.
You know,
look at everybody's not perfect.
Uh,

1326
01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:05.490
but I do know how many grams in the fucking announce when I'm saying,
okay,

1327
01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:10.690
as you know,
working smartest guy,
Ventura,

1328
01:22:10.710 --> 01:22:15.120
where's it benchmark?
Uh,
but his act,
what I've seen of him,

1329
01:22:16.230 --> 01:22:18.480
he doesn't have to,
like,

1330
01:22:18.481 --> 01:22:22.310
some comics really have to connect with he,

1331
01:22:22.530 --> 01:22:24.150
he's so smart and brilliant.

1332
01:22:24.330 --> 01:22:28.920
He could do his act laying down on a couch with his head.
Do you know what I do?

1333
01:22:28.921 --> 01:22:30.450
You get what I'm saying?
Like he's so smart.

1334
01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:35.560
I think he's so smart as a person that you could listen to him and you don't

1335
01:22:36.271 --> 01:22:40.350
have to see him to get what he's saying.
You're not a comedy album.

1336
01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:45.510
No.
No,
but I'm saying you're saying a comedy club.

1337
01:22:45.511 --> 01:22:50.310
What people are sitting down.
So focus,
you know,
when I do stand up,

1338
01:22:50.850 --> 01:22:55.710
a lot of times I'll sit on the direct tension right on the,
you know,
focused,

1339
01:22:56.030 --> 01:22:58.590
right?
But someone like me,
I can't,
I,

1340
01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:03.570
he is just so smart debt all you could close your eyes and listening to what

1341
01:23:03.571 --> 01:23:06.400
he's saying.
Go on.
This is some brilliant shit.

1342
01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:10.540
[inaudible] that doesn't make sense.
A marathon,
he's brilliant.

1343
01:23:10.930 --> 01:23:12.190
I don't know what you're saying now.

1344
01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:15.040
You're not really doing a good job of tall book is you're saying you,
you,

1345
01:23:15.041 --> 01:23:20.030
you the standing,
the standing up,
he would do better sitting down.

1346
01:23:20.050 --> 01:23:23.980
Oh,
that's not what I said.
Oh,
I meant when you're in the audience.
Yeah.

1347
01:23:24.010 --> 01:23:27.550
It's uncomfortable to stand for a long period of time and I'll never do a

1348
01:23:27.551 --> 01:23:31.660
standing show where the audience has to stand because they're not comfortable.

1349
01:23:31.661 --> 01:23:34.630
They don't enjoy it the way you enjoy it.
If you could sit down and relax,

1350
01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:37.600
but you're saying if it's not comfortable,

1351
01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:42.520
then you're not taking in everything that's being said because you're not

1352
01:23:42.521 --> 01:23:45.620
comfortable.
No.
Yeah.
I mean it's just,
I mean,
that's comes in a car.

1353
01:23:45.670 --> 01:23:49.000
It's not as good as an experience because discomfort is a part of the
experience.

1354
01:23:49.001 --> 01:23:51.310
Instead of just being to,
if you're sitting down watching a show,

1355
01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:52.780
you can just concentrate on the show,

1356
01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:56.800
but 45 an hour and a half into a show and you're standing for that whole time,

1357
01:23:56.801 --> 01:24:00.220
your feet start to hurt.
They'll do that for a rocker end.
Yeah.

1358
01:24:00.221 --> 01:24:01.660
I bet you're dancing around and stuff.

1359
01:24:01.661 --> 01:24:04.940
Like my legs were locked into the point where I felt like I was almost about to

1360
01:24:05.230 --> 01:24:10.090
fall over.
I don't know what my point was.
The fucking guy,
he's brilliant.

1361
01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:13.060
Oh,
he's definitely brilliant.
I don't even think he does standing shows anymore.

1362
01:24:13.061 --> 01:24:13.920
I don't think it doesn't mind,

1363
01:24:13.930 --> 01:24:17.920
but most people have abandoned them all you all it takes is being an audience

1364
01:24:17.921 --> 01:24:21.040
member wants and he'd go,
oh well fuck this.
You know?

1365
01:24:21.041 --> 01:24:23.080
That's why I stopped doing the House of Blues in Vegas.

1366
01:24:23.081 --> 01:24:27.160
They used to have that fucking standing part on the side.
Oh that's the worst.

1367
01:24:27.330 --> 01:24:29.260
Do you have the seated part?
Which was awesome.

1368
01:24:29.530 --> 01:24:32.410
And then they have the top seating.
Awesome.
But then they'd have to,

1369
01:24:32.411 --> 01:24:36.610
bar area was filled with people just standing and it was fucking terrible.

1370
01:24:36.730 --> 01:24:41.200
It was terrible.
It's like they would talk like he would literally,

1371
01:24:41.230 --> 01:24:44.680
you would have like,
I would like be trying to do standup at a nightclub.

1372
01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:48.970
Like when there's a full on like bar scene happening and you know,

1373
01:24:48.971 --> 01:24:53.380
attention everyone just like you're interrupting conversations instead of,

1374
01:24:53.710 --> 01:24:54.760
if you go to a comedy club,

1375
01:24:54.761 --> 01:24:58.630
everybody seated the show starts and that they're there to see a comedy club.

1376
01:24:58.631 --> 01:25:02.380
There's too much,
too much room for variables.
Some comedy clubs you like,

1377
01:25:02.381 --> 01:25:05.470
I've done some rooms like in casinos,

1378
01:25:05.471 --> 01:25:08.920
whatever where the sheets are too comfortable and now they're too fucking

1379
01:25:08.921 --> 01:25:11.450
relaxed and you know the,

1380
01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:15.820
those cushion seats and they're laying back and are not couches are not good for

1381
01:25:15.821 --> 01:25:18.610
calming.
No,
you can't be too comfortable.
Haha.

1382
01:25:18.611 --> 01:25:20.470
Has couches in the front and it's like,

1383
01:25:20.471 --> 01:25:24.620
this is a little too goddamn casual to flux.
Is that an la and la?
Yeah,

1384
01:25:24.730 --> 01:25:29.680
it's a north Hollywood,
a smaller club.
So you can't be too comfortable.

1385
01:25:29.681 --> 01:25:33.740
You can't be too uncomfortable.
Like I went to,
um,

1386
01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:37.390
Sturgill Simpson did a cone and the other day and I went to watch and it's

1387
01:25:37.570 --> 01:25:41.320
fucking cold as shit in there.
They've got that thing going on.

1388
01:25:41.321 --> 01:25:45.070
Like Letterman likes to do.
Like we used to crank down the uh,
the temperature,

1389
01:25:45.071 --> 01:25:49.140
like way down,
like in the 60s.
Isn't that for the lighting?
The light bulbs.

1390
01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:54.170
But I think the idea behind Letterman was that when you were cold,
you will,

1391
01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:55.300
you have a little bit more energy.

1392
01:25:55.301 --> 01:25:58.530
You're more likely to laugh then if it's really hot,
it's really hot in the room.

1393
01:25:58.570 --> 01:26:02.140
People don't laugh as much.
It kind of makes sense.
Oh fuck.

1394
01:26:02.890 --> 01:26:04.040
I'm going to pass out dry

1395
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:08.510
<v 0>isis weekend.
She's going to fucking Touro Harbor Comedy Club in Ventura,</v>

1396
01:26:08.511 --> 01:26:13.100
California at eight through Sunday.
Are you there on Sunday too?
Yeah.
Wow.

1397
01:26:14.230 --> 01:26:16.430
Well He,
I am happy,
but here's the problem.

1398
01:26:17.150 --> 01:26:22.150
Sunday day I was invited to play golf at Bel Air Comedy Bel Air Country Club.

1399
01:26:24.890 --> 01:26:29.420
Okay,
so I'm going to drive from Ventura to Bel Air.
That's like two hours.

1400
01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:34.010
No,
it happened.
How come some people tell me 40 minutes,
some team?
45

1401
01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:40.550
an hour.
It took me two hours from Ventura to what?

1402
01:26:41.170 --> 01:26:45.800
Shut Bayview.
Look it up on that question with traffic.
There's no traffic.

1403
01:26:45.801 --> 01:26:50.000
It's Sunday morning at 7:00 AM 7:00 AM you're adorable.
You're adorable.

1404
01:26:50.001 --> 01:26:54.260
You don't know.
Los Angeles,
7:00 AM there easily can be Sunday morning easily.

1405
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:55.340
If you go to Orange County,

1406
01:26:55.341 --> 01:26:58.730
you might be stopped dead and you might be stopped dead on a highway at 7:00 AM

1407
01:26:59.060 --> 01:27:03.030
on the five take the five Sunday morning might be stopped dead.
Okay,

1408
01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:07.810
but I'm just saying the overpopulated place.
No,
I,
I,
I get that side.

1409
01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:11.780
Look how beautiful it is.
It's like that in February.
Yeah,
it's perfect.

1410
01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:14.990
Perfect weather.
But you look at a distance,
people find out about it.

1411
01:27:14.991 --> 01:27:18.830
They move here.
They have cars,
they drive,
they go,
you know what?

1412
01:27:18.831 --> 01:27:20.630
I'm just going to get up seven o'clock in the morning.

1413
01:27:20.631 --> 01:27:22.250
Who is going to be up on Sunday morning?
Oh,

1414
01:27:22.251 --> 01:27:25.940
there's only 90 fucking million people live here.
Jesus Christ.

1415
01:27:25.941 --> 01:27:27.850
You really don't have to depress the person.
I was looking,

1416
01:27:28.570 --> 01:27:31.490
I was looking forward to my day at Bel Air when you can do it.

1417
01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:35.990
You just couldn't believe.
Well,
I gotta be there by like nine saw.
Leave at seven.

1418
01:27:36.110 --> 01:27:40.460
Yeah,
you'll be fine.
No,
it's fine.
It's an hour and 40 minutes.

1419
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:44.630
40 minutes from Bel Air to Ventura County.

1420
01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:47.030
It's an hour and two minutes without traffic,

1421
01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:52.340
which is adorable.
Why don't they just say if you fly?

1422
01:27:53.380 --> 01:27:57.770
Yeah.
Fuck.
So how has that Ventura harbor,

1423
01:27:57.771 --> 01:28:01.820
if you'd done that before?
I've never done it.
I heard good things.
Yeah.
Uh,

1424
01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:05.150
or it's a good company.
Yeah,
but I've never been there.
Have you ever been there?

1425
01:28:05.410 --> 01:28:08.210
No better.
Some guy contacted me there from there I think.
But I mean,

1426
01:28:08.211 --> 01:28:13.211
how come like a guy like especially you when you're doing like weekend rooms,

1427
01:28:14.091 --> 01:28:18.560
go into San Diego
Tuesday,
Wednesday stuff.

1428
01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:21.530
You do what?
Do weekends too?
Yeah,
but some weekends,
but yeah,

1429
01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:26.390
mostly say Wednesdays.
Oh,
okay.
I love Santa Barbara.
Oh,
I love it up there.

1430
01:28:26.391 --> 01:28:28.910
Just a little bit further north.
That's chose my whipped favorite spots.

1431
01:28:29.140 --> 01:28:30.450
That's what I got my weight on it.

1432
01:28:30.530 --> 01:28:33.830
When I become like Dennis Miller becomes some old conservative man with a radio

1433
01:28:33.831 --> 01:28:38.360
show.
Who's Heather?
Santa Barbara.
He lives up there.
It was all the white people,

1434
01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:41.840
all white people.
They just rally on against Mexicans.

1435
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:46.220
We fucking angry about black people up there.
Why you could do that anywhere,

1436
01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:51.650
do it.
I mean,
you can't do it exclusively.
It's you're,

1437
01:28:51.690 --> 01:28:54.700
you're preaching to the choir.
Everyone around you.
I mean,

1438
01:28:54.701 --> 01:28:59.000
this is like zero diversity.
Do you know San Jose is the number ones,
uh,

1439
01:28:59.030 --> 01:29:03.000
less amount of black people in the United States of America,
San Jose

1440
01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.830
<v 3>and number two is San Francisco.</v>

1441
01:29:05.130 --> 01:29:08.340
San Francisco is the least amount of black people in United States.

1442
01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:11.910
That doesn't make sense.
Well,
what does Oakland number one?
Oh yeah,
it,

1443
01:29:12.170 --> 01:29:14.750
it's all black people.
Um,
they all moved to Oakland.

1444
01:29:14.751 --> 01:29:18.300
They can't afford San Francisco and Oakland is now like,
they're like,

1445
01:29:18.301 --> 01:29:19.550
it's totally different now.

1446
01:29:19.551 --> 01:29:24.420
I've always thought San Francisco is really diversified.
Yeah.
With Asians.

1447
01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:28.330
Well,
a mindset is diversive in,
I mean,

1448
01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:33.210
San Francisco's the real estate is so fucking ridiculous now.

1449
01:29:33.630 --> 01:29:37.980
The tech boom has fucked that place up so bad.
The prices are just,

1450
01:29:37.981 --> 01:29:40.140
they don't make any sense like you would,

1451
01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:43.170
you'd be an asshole to buy a house in San Francisco now,
unless,

1452
01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:47.190
unless you've got like Elon Musk money and you don't give a fuck,

1453
01:29:47.191 --> 01:29:51.150
you'll spend three minutes.
I saw a house for $3 million and my jaw dropped.

1454
01:29:51.151 --> 01:29:54.690
I was like,
this doesn't make any sense.
This is a $400,000 house.

1455
01:29:54.850 --> 01:29:59.160
How is this $3 million?
A little shit.
Right.
It was just,
it was a house,

1456
01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:03.360
a nice house,
but it wasn't $3 million.
I mean,
it didn't make any sense.
Well,

1457
01:30:03.361 --> 01:30:06.630
I look at these people in New York,
they fucking get,
these apartments are crazy,

1458
01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:09.890
that are as big as this table for a fucking crazy.
I go,
are you,

1459
01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:15.560
all you have to do is move 20 minutes in into Jersey and you could buy a fucking

1460
01:30:15.871 --> 01:30:20.310
house.
You know,
I looked at the house apartments in New York for a bit.

1461
01:30:20.490 --> 01:30:22.620
There was a time where I was thinking about moving to New York.

1462
01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:26.640
Just like to mix things up,
you know?
Yeah.
But it just didn't make any sense.

1463
01:30:26.730 --> 01:30:30.570
And you know,
the,
you know,
one thing that gets me about New York is a,

1464
01:30:30.571 --> 01:30:33.900
the sets that you do around town,
they're real short.
You know,

1465
01:30:33.901 --> 01:30:37.560
everyone's doing like 15 minutes,
10 minutes.
I'm like,
that is not enough.

1466
01:30:37.860 --> 01:30:42.150
That's not enough time to really get busy.
But when you can,
you can,

1467
01:30:42.570 --> 01:30:45.690
you'd be able to do more time in places.
You know,

1468
01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:48.300
when rock walks in and he's not,
he's doing what he wants you to do.

1469
01:30:48.510 --> 01:30:52.740
When you know Sharon comics walk in,
you know,
Louie or whatever.

1470
01:30:52.830 --> 01:30:55.170
I'm sure you could do a half an hour.

1471
01:30:55.220 --> 01:30:59.550
They wouldn't have liked to walk into that.
I want to schedule that.

1472
01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:00.270
You know what I mean?

1473
01:31:00.270 --> 01:31:02.850
It's one of the reasons why I like doing the belly room and we do those weekends

1474
01:31:02.851 --> 01:31:06.780
at the belly room.
I could do 45 minutes in town on a Friday,
Saturday night,

1475
01:31:07.110 --> 01:31:11.190
you know,
like that.
Like you,
if you got to really hone your act,

1476
01:31:11.490 --> 01:31:15.150
I'm not working on one bit,
you know,
I'm working on six,

1477
01:31:15.151 --> 01:31:20.151
seven bits and trying to put together like a real hour for my next special and

1478
01:31:21.031 --> 01:31:25.510
if I'm doing a 10 or 15 minutes set,
there's just not enough time for that.
I,

1479
01:31:25.511 --> 01:31:29.640
and I don't want to do that whole trek around doing seven,
eight sets a night.

1480
01:31:29.641 --> 01:31:33.570
I just think that's what I wouldn't do that ever.
I do may never do one or two.

1481
01:31:33.571 --> 01:31:36.240
I never done.
I did it years ago in New York,

1482
01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:40.170
but I work out my material on the road.
You know Chris,
actually what?

1483
01:31:40.171 --> 01:31:43.590
I work it out and economy clubs because I'm going to have enough good stuff

1484
01:31:43.591 --> 01:31:47.250
around it.
If it doesn't work,
then the next one's Gunna,

1485
01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:50.100
when I know in New York when we were doing standup together,

1486
01:31:50.101 --> 01:31:53.820
I hardly ever did the city because I could do Connecticut or I could do long

1487
01:31:53.821 --> 01:31:57.870
island or could you jersey and I had make a 150 bucks.
Yeah.
You know,

1488
01:31:57.871 --> 01:32:00.070
I can make like real money get paid

1489
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:04.450
<v 2>versus if I was in town and I get 25 bucks here,
10 bucks there.
It's like what?</v>

1490
01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:09.690
I'm not doing 10 sets a night to make $100 and it just seems so stupid because I

1491
01:32:09.730 --> 01:32:13.240
can't get roadwork or in the shitty bounce from club to club.
You know,

1492
01:32:13.241 --> 01:32:16.570
there's guys that do seven sets a night.
I could,
you know what,

1493
01:32:16.850 --> 01:32:19.860
getting a job on fucking Wall Street because there's no way there's old cock

1494
01:32:19.861 --> 01:32:23.650
suckers running around town.
But luckily I can work on the road.

1495
01:32:24.100 --> 01:32:27.130
And like you said,
you can work in DC,
Baltimore,

1496
01:32:27.250 --> 01:32:31.520
these are all driving distance where you could drive home Saturday night.
Right.

1497
01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:36.130
You know,
I tried call Philadelphia,
even Boston,
you know,

1498
01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:40.030
it's,
it's three and a half,
four hours,
whatever.
So you could do,

1499
01:32:40.031 --> 01:32:44.020
you could make a great living.
There's so much around there,
you know?

1500
01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:47.530
That's when I asked him,
like,
if,
you know,
you talked about San Diego,
well,

1501
01:32:47.531 --> 01:32:52.000
how are you not working at this other place if it's only an hour and a half away

1502
01:32:52.001 --> 01:32:56.830
on a weekend.
There was one place I used to work,
rooster t feathers or something,

1503
01:32:56.831 --> 01:33:01.000
or where's that?
I heard about that.
I went to fuck.
Is it,
you know,

1504
01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:06.250
that's still around?
Yeah,
I think so.
I think so.
But a silicone valley,

1505
01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:11.630
we're still
the San Francisco area.
Yeah,
it's,
yeah,

1506
01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:13.140
it's something that got there.
Oh,

1507
01:33:13.150 --> 01:33:15.460
that's not driving distance from here that you could drive,

1508
01:33:15.461 --> 01:33:18.760
but it's going to be six plus hours.
That's too far.
But depending on traffic,

1509
01:33:19.090 --> 01:33:23.320
there's,
unlike La,
New York or Jersey where I live,

1510
01:33:23.830 --> 01:33:28.270
you could work fucking almost all year round and make a good living in weekend

1511
01:33:28.271 --> 01:33:33.220
common,
you know,
you know,
are you doing weekday gigs anywhere now?

1512
01:33:33.221 --> 01:33:37.360
We do a once in a while I'll get a private or a fundraiser,
you know,

1513
01:33:37.570 --> 01:33:41.530
like Tuesday night we'll do our radio show on Sirius and that's done.

1514
01:33:41.630 --> 01:33:43.690
We'll do a spot in the city here and there.

1515
01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:48.490
Cause you do on Tuesday series is in the city and the city in,
Oop,

1516
01:33:48.491 --> 01:33:52.870
we do oop studio me and do,
uh,
our radio show from seven and nine.

1517
01:33:52.871 --> 01:33:57.871
My wife hates me to radio show and so then I'll do a spot after it may be at the

1518
01:33:58.271 --> 01:34:03.180
cellar to hang out and or whatever,
uh,

1519
01:34:03.490 --> 01:34:04.270
you know,

1520
01:34:04.270 --> 01:34:09.120
and then Wednesday I probably will stay home cause I'm gonna leave Thursday,

1521
01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:13.990
Friday,
whatever,
you know.
So I try to be home Wednesday,
Sunday,
Monday,

1522
01:34:13.990 --> 01:34:17.590
Wednesday as much as I can if I got,
you know what I mean,
to be with my kid and,

1523
01:34:17.690 --> 01:34:21.270
and then I'll leave Sunday.
Uh,
you know,
once,

1524
01:34:21.370 --> 01:34:26.370
once in a blue moon on Wednesday night we'll go over to the stress factory on

1525
01:34:26.411 --> 01:34:31.210
open mic night and do some time cause it's 20 minutes from our house.
So we go,

1526
01:34:31.211 --> 01:34:34.150
well we want to work out something.
Why go into the city?

1527
01:34:34.151 --> 01:34:35.630
We just go to the open mic nights.

1528
01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:38.530
Just stretched out to the crowd or the stress factory on those nights.

1529
01:34:38.531 --> 01:34:40.240
Some nights it's crowded,
you know,

1530
01:34:40.241 --> 01:34:44.380
some nights it's tons of comics but it,
you know,

1531
01:34:44.470 --> 01:34:48.370
it's okay.
It's 20 we go there.
We took our kid on a Wednesday.

1532
01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:52.870
Not a lot of clubs in New Jersey.
Huh.
And stress factor.

1533
01:34:52.871 --> 01:34:56.350
That's all you really hear about bananas,
bananas and uh,

1534
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:58.230
wherever I was at for

1535
01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:02.630
<v 0>updates at point pleasant or something.
But that is in a shadow.</v>

1536
01:35:02.631 --> 01:35:05.180
Their saddles are bananas in Poughkeepsie,
right,
isn't it?
Yeah.

1537
01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:07.670
What guides the other one's closed.
Closed.
Yeah.

1538
01:35:08.210 --> 01:35:11.000
<v 1>Well where makes that Sushi place we did was that Jersey.</v>

1539
01:35:11.230 --> 01:35:15.290
I remember it was like an old Chinese restaurant and some reason and it had a

1540
01:35:15.291 --> 01:35:18.740
weird stage,
like the stage look like a town or something.

1541
01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:21.770
And it was like a restaurant,
but they did comedy.
Well,

1542
01:35:21.771 --> 01:35:26.000
uncle Vinnie's does comedy.
When was this?
Five years ago.
It was me.
You,

1543
01:35:26.001 --> 01:35:29.900
Joey Diaz is,
I think,
well,
was it a Jesus,

1544
01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:34.670
Dave Sushi Dan?
It was like a Sushi restaurant and I was in New Jersey.

1545
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:38.990
It was either new juice upstream and work.
No,
no,
you don't remember.

1546
01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:43.040
It was like a,
it was a restaurant in the stage.
Look like an a fake town.

1547
01:35:43.041 --> 01:35:44.270
Like it was a fake house.

1548
01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:47.290
He came out and look like you're on a front porch of a house or something,
right?

1549
01:35:47.610 --> 01:35:50.910
<v 0>Oh No,
no,
no,
no.
You're wrong.
That was a western Massachusetts.</v>

1550
01:35:51.030 --> 01:35:54.420
That's a cha Chinese restaurant.
That's the Kooky Lau.

1551
01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:58.920
That's a for the comedy connection.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You do a,

1552
01:35:58.921 --> 01:36:02.400
you would do Friday night in the city and the new,
do you Friday night in Boston,

1553
01:36:02.401 --> 01:36:06.550
you do Saturday night out,
the Hooky Lau or Sunday,
the Hook Isla,
those death

1554
01:36:08.190 --> 01:36:11.680
has,
there's a place uncle Vinnie's chickopee.
That's what it was.
Ugliness.

1555
01:36:11.890 --> 01:36:15.900
But there's no liquor license.
It's bring your own beer or whatever.
You know,

1556
01:36:15.930 --> 01:36:19.260
they can't afford a liquor license.
But he gets big acts.
Dhea fuck it.

1557
01:36:19.261 --> 01:36:22.770
You can bring your own booze.
I guess they show up with a bottle of wine,

1558
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:26.820
whatever wine.
And he does all way.
I mean,

1559
01:36:26.821 --> 01:36:30.510
just stretch factory obviously is the big club in directory.
Uh,

1560
01:36:31.740 --> 01:36:36.370
bananas brings him big acts,
you know,
they'll open the door.
Uh,

1561
01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:40.260
W I'm doing one in Boston.
It's a great new club in Boston.
A

1562
01:36:41.940 --> 01:36:43.740
Boston laugh boss.
I've done that.

1563
01:36:43.770 --> 01:36:47.670
I fucking love the fucking hotel is beautifully.
You stay right there,

1564
01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:51.960
right there.
Just come on down.
Come down.
The people that own it are great.

1565
01:36:52.810 --> 01:36:57.030
Recently.
It's,
he did,
what a fucking great gig.
Yeah.
You know,

1566
01:36:57.090 --> 01:36:59.580
I usually do the Wilbur,
but it was a,
somebody already had it.

1567
01:36:59.610 --> 01:37:03.840
It was a last minute thing because there was a UFC in Boston and uh,

1568
01:37:03.841 --> 01:37:06.540
I wasn't supposed to work here because there was a Fox sports one gig.

1569
01:37:06.541 --> 01:37:10.350
I usually do the,
uh,
either the paper views or the Fox gigs,
the Big Fox gigs,

1570
01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:13.710
but for whatever reason I wanted to do it or they wanted me to do it.

1571
01:37:13.711 --> 01:37:15.720
I forget how it worked.
And,
uh,

1572
01:37:15.810 --> 01:37:19.080
I had to do the lap pos and I had a great fucking time.
Yeah,
it's a great club,

1573
01:37:19.081 --> 01:37:23.640
right?
Yeah,
it's really good.
And they'll buy the restaurant surrounding the club,

1574
01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:26.310
you know,
whatever you want to do.
Too many good clubs.

1575
01:37:26.311 --> 01:37:29.580
It's so sad to go back and said,
well there's a little bit of a scene there now.

1576
01:37:29.710 --> 01:37:30.840
A lot of,
a little bit of a,
you know,

1577
01:37:30.841 --> 01:37:34.050
young comics coming up that are trying real hard that are,
you know,

1578
01:37:34.230 --> 01:37:35.250
trying to put together a scene.

1579
01:37:35.251 --> 01:37:39.210
But it takes decades to put together a scene like they used to have there.

1580
01:37:39.211 --> 01:37:42.510
It's amazing that it deteriorated the way it did and a big part of the reason

1581
01:37:42.511 --> 01:37:45.510
why I deteriorated as guys stopped writing,
they stopped writing.

1582
01:37:45.511 --> 01:37:48.170
Those guys are doing the same act for fucking decades.
Well No.

1583
01:37:50.140 --> 01:37:53.970
Was to club set didn't last.
I mean Nick,
why do you think they didn't last?

1584
01:37:54.420 --> 01:37:57.000
I mean there's a of that was that guy stopped writing.

1585
01:37:57.090 --> 01:38:01.230
It was I guess a real flower using the same guys and same guys,

1586
01:38:01.850 --> 01:38:05.410
same age.
It's still fun to watch.
But he had,
if he knew,

1587
01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:08.180
if you would go back to see Steve Sweeney every year and you knew he was going

1588
01:38:08.190 --> 01:38:12.360
to have a,
a new act,
that's like the one that you saw before.
Like I say,

1589
01:38:12.570 --> 01:38:17.340
if you went out and you could guarantee that you're going to see a half hour new

1590
01:38:17.341 --> 01:38:21.790
material from Sweeney and then a half hour of that old killer stuff that you

1591
01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:25.710
would love it.
But actually that's a good point.
All yeah,

1592
01:38:25.740 --> 01:38:27.570
I do blame a lot.
You're right.

1593
01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:30.780
The college back then because they didn't know what I mean with the Internet,

1594
01:38:30.781 --> 01:38:33.300
you can't do that.
You can't do that anymore.

1595
01:38:33.450 --> 01:38:36.150
So now everybody is doing the George Carlin method.

1596
01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:39.180
We tried to do a whole new special,
you know,

1597
01:38:39.181 --> 01:38:42.540
between a year and a year and a half,
two years depending on,

1598
01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:46.500
you know how you feel like some guys think that a year is too soon,

1599
01:38:46.501 --> 01:38:50.310
the material's not good enough and some guys think you know that your waste

1600
01:38:50.490 --> 01:38:51.960
waste time developing.

1601
01:38:51.961 --> 01:38:55.920
We should just move on to the next act and in five minutes,
Kathy Griffin,

1602
01:38:55.921 --> 01:38:58.200
we'll have another hour,
five minutes.

1603
01:38:58.230 --> 01:39:03.050
It tells you what you put down an hour every two hours or every two hours.

1604
01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:07.590
She puts out a lot of hours out,
but she's not lying with her and telling jokes.

1605
01:39:07.670 --> 01:39:08.940
A lot of them are stories,

1606
01:39:08.941 --> 01:39:11.880
stories about her hanging out with share and stuff like share stuff,

1607
01:39:11.881 --> 01:39:13.650
returning her call.
She lose half of our act.

1608
01:39:17.270 --> 01:39:19.500
Uh Gee.
I tried to do,

1609
01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:24.140
that's what the people love the town they called us.

1610
01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:27.420
I tried to do it at a new CD every two years.

1611
01:39:27.450 --> 01:39:29.250
Every two years I tried to do a new sheet.
Yeah,

1612
01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:33.790
two years is a good time because that means you work on it for a solid year and

1613
01:39:33.790 --> 01:39:37.730
a half and then the last six months you just fucking sharpening that sword sheet

1614
01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:40.620
and then by the time it comes around you're filming,
you're sick of it.

1615
01:39:40.650 --> 01:39:41.670
You don't want to do that anymore.

1616
01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:44.880
<v 2>I add and take out,
add and take out.</v>

1617
01:39:44.881 --> 01:39:49.350
Like I know like I think like Chris,
I've seen Chris,

1618
01:39:49.351 --> 01:39:51.480
I think maybe even lily does it.

1619
01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:55.770
Like I'll see Chris go on it shaved with a whole note.
You know,

1620
01:39:55.771 --> 01:40:00.771
he's trying to do a whole new half or 45 at once.

1621
01:40:01.321 --> 01:40:05.340
Get it all together.
You know,
I throw it in a new bit,
drop a bit,

1622
01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:06.900
throwing a new bit,
drop a bit.

1623
01:40:07.050 --> 01:40:09.960
But some of these fucking guys like Louie and critter fucking naked,

1624
01:40:09.961 --> 01:40:12.750
just write an hour like he wrote for Chris.

1625
01:40:12.751 --> 01:40:16.230
You helped him right when he was doing like some of the specials,
right?
No,

1626
01:40:16.231 --> 01:40:19.620
I wrote,
I was,
when he did it on the Oscars,

1627
01:40:19.621 --> 01:40:24.480
I wrote his last movie,
top five.
I wrote on that.
Uh,

1628
01:40:24.630 --> 01:40:29.250
uh,
you know,
I helped to punch up,
you know,
Eh,
and s Chris was smart.

1629
01:40:29.251 --> 01:40:33.210
He had a couple of times he,
you know,
Depaulo topology.
Paul was in on the movie.

1630
01:40:33.211 --> 01:40:37.070
He was on the Oscars.
Yeah.
Oscars.
And
yes,

1631
01:40:37.730 --> 01:40:41.160
when we did the Oscars fucking Jenny,
you know,

1632
01:40:41.190 --> 01:40:46.190
the problem with a lot of big comics and you're going to is that they can be,

1633
01:40:50.370 --> 01:40:53.980
a lot of people aren't honest with them.
Everybody,
when

1634
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:57.520
<v 3>you get you a shirt level has a lot of yet.
Yeah.
That's great.
That's great.</v>

1635
01:40:57.521 --> 01:40:58.910
That's,
yes.
Yeah.
No,
you could do it.

1636
01:40:59.110 --> 01:41:02.940
And it's really not to their standard.

1637
01:41:03.490 --> 01:41:05.260
And when we wrote on the Oscars,

1638
01:41:05.890 --> 01:41:10.420
Jenny had no problem saying to Chris,
that stinks.
Don't do it.

1639
01:41:10.570 --> 01:41:12.310
It's not right.
You know?

1640
01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:15.640
And obviously Jenny knew what he was talking about cause he was one of the best

1641
01:41:15.641 --> 01:41:17.830
fucking comics in history.

1642
01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:21.400
I talk about them all the time on the show that he was like the one guy.

1643
01:41:21.401 --> 01:41:23.140
When people talk about some of the all time greats,

1644
01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:25.180
the one God that they leave out,
I'm like,

1645
01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:27.850
you didn't see him in the 80s he missed it.

1646
01:41:28.420 --> 01:41:31.840
If you saw Jenny in the eighties early nineties he's one of the best of all
time.

1647
01:41:32.530 --> 01:41:37.030
How could you not think this guy?
He had to see him though.

1648
01:41:37.031 --> 01:41:38.500
The way we saw he,

1649
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:42.580
he would take a premise and bringing it to a whole nother level.

1650
01:41:42.610 --> 01:41:45.820
He w he was the guy.
You know like when people say like your jokes,

1651
01:41:45.821 --> 01:41:49.750
like you take a premise and you just use squeeze all the juice out of it or

1652
01:41:49.751 --> 01:41:51.280
right when you think you can't get any more out of it,

1653
01:41:51.281 --> 01:41:53.530
you take it to another place.
I learned that watching Jenny,

1654
01:41:53.770 --> 01:41:58.770
I really did because I remember thinking that I was just scratching the surface

1655
01:41:59.921 --> 01:42:04.750
of these subjects,
whereas he understood how to explore all of them.
He,

1656
01:42:04.751 --> 01:42:09.700
uh,
I'll tell you another one I watch and when I watch dom,

1657
01:42:09.710 --> 01:42:13.310
I rera I'm going,
this is one of the funniest guys alive.
No,
he,

1658
01:42:13.340 --> 01:42:17.290
he just a powerhouse.
She's a murderer.

1659
01:42:17.410 --> 01:42:20.170
Fucking power talking shit.
Like he's the,

1660
01:42:20.171 --> 01:42:21.880
one of the best guys ever on killed Tony.

1661
01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:25.270
Like when will kill Tony is this podcast that we do.
Um,

1662
01:42:25.330 --> 01:42:27.430
and they'll have like new comics,

1663
01:42:27.431 --> 01:42:31.490
like open microbes to grow up and do one minute and then it'll be like Dahmer

1664
01:42:31.490 --> 01:42:35.180
Breira,
Tony Hinchcliffe,
Brian,
maybe me and the different comics,
you know,

1665
01:42:35.181 --> 01:42:38.280
like Russell Peters,
I said all these different comics will sit in on a,

1666
01:42:38.410 --> 01:42:42.870
do a guest spot and dom Irrera murders his fucking eyes.
I mean murders them.

1667
01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:47.340
He breaks it down.
I mean,
and it's effortless for him.
You're crying and laughing.

1668
01:42:47.341 --> 01:42:50.530
I mean,
that's,
if you guys ever do one of doing that as a television show,

1669
01:42:50.531 --> 01:42:53.920
you really should have dom on like permanently.
Like,
he's the guy,
he's your best

1670
01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:59.710
pages.
Unnecessary as,
as the singer guy.
I think we do that in New York.

1671
01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:06.360
Sharad had a show at the comic strip where the new comics would go on like five

1672
01:43:07.001 --> 01:43:09.760
of them and then we'd sit there and judge,

1673
01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:15.900
but they did like five minutes and you don't want to destroy their dreams,

1674
01:43:16.661 --> 01:43:18.810
but you have to be honest with them,
you know,

1675
01:43:18.820 --> 01:43:21.040
cause she was just going to have false hope.

1676
01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:26.400
And a lot of comics do have false hope because no one will tell them exactly.

1677
01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:31.050
No one will call him,
you know,
this is how you do it.
When I first started,
I,

1678
01:43:31.300 --> 01:43:34.990
I mean I stunk last year,
but I really stunk when I started.
Uh,

1679
01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:38.710
you don't find your voice to,
who knows when,
you know,
you've got to,

1680
01:43:38.711 --> 01:43:39.340
it's a lot of things,

1681
01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:41.920
a lot of work and there's a lot of being honest and there's a lot of listening

1682
01:43:41.921 --> 01:43:45.460
to yourself and there's a lot of correction and everybody doesn't start from the

1683
01:43:45.461 --> 01:43:49.870
same spot.
Some guys start out funnier than you and you just got to accept that.

1684
01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:52.010
You can't judge yourself by that.
You just

1685
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:55.520
<v 2>got to keep going.
Just keep going and keep trying to improve on what you do.</v>

1686
01:43:56.150 --> 01:43:59.600
Like when you say,
this is what I wanted to ask,
when you would write for Chris,

1687
01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:03.170
like how,
what did the process,
what was it like two guys meet in an office?

1688
01:44:03.171 --> 01:44:07.460
Like how did,
how did it work for the Oscars,
for any of the things you did?
Well,

1689
01:44:07.461 --> 01:44:08.960
the movie,
the movie,

1690
01:44:08.961 --> 01:44:13.961
we'd sit on the set [inaudible] and if you saw him do one thing and it didn't

1691
01:44:14.841 --> 01:44:17.660
always have to be funny,
you can go,
uh,

1692
01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:20.990
maybe say it that way or walking from here and do it,

1693
01:44:20.991 --> 01:44:22.800
take your shirt off or do you know what I mean?

1694
01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:28.500
It just had different eyes on him cause he was directing besides ash writing

1695
01:44:29.710 --> 01:44:33.890
[inaudible] and writing.
So,
you know,
when he has different,
I,
you know,

1696
01:44:33.891 --> 01:44:37.150
he had another comic,
uh,
uh,

1697
01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:41.510
his name's slipping my mind and another semi,
another director,
uh,

1698
01:44:42.260 --> 01:44:46.670
Nelson George and,
and,
and you know,
and it's exact.
And coach was on the set to,

1699
01:44:46.671 --> 01:44:51.350
this is all for top five.
Right?
And,
and not every day was I,

1700
01:44:51.351 --> 01:44:55.490
you know,
uh,
and it see something,
or you say a line,

1701
01:44:56.030 --> 01:44:59.720
you know,
uh,
and he,
and when Chris liked that,

1702
01:44:59.721 --> 01:45:03.610
you could tell he liked it and if he didn't,
like you're gone,
you know.
So,

1703
01:45:03.611 --> 01:45:06.290
and for the Oscars,
he pretty much had his own stuff.

1704
01:45:06.291 --> 01:45:09.560
He kinda knew what he wanted to do for that,
but he would say to the comics,

1705
01:45:09.590 --> 01:45:14.590
and he had like 13 writers.
He had,
you know,
chef wrote Apollo,
uh,

1706
01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:19.700
uh,
lands,
uh,
and his crew.
And,
uh,
still sin was the head,

1707
01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:21.860
you know,
I guess the head writer Jeff Stilson,

1708
01:45:22.310 --> 01:45:25.070
you know me and you know,

1709
01:45:25.100 --> 01:45:27.860
he'd go out to the comedy club and he goes,
well,

1710
01:45:27.861 --> 01:45:31.730
I'm going to laugh factory now.
Who are,
who wants to come?
Whoever wants to come,

1711
01:45:31.731 --> 01:45:35.150
I'll be at,
and some of them didn't go,
but I,
we went,

1712
01:45:35.180 --> 01:45:40.040
I went every night to sit and watch and,
and you know,

1713
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:43.130
this is the set he's going to do at the Oscars and then,
you know,

1714
01:45:43.190 --> 01:45:47.510
notes and give notes.
But with the Oscars,
we didn't give them to,

1715
01:45:47.511 --> 01:45:48.550
I didn't give no write down.

1716
01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:53.560
I sent mine in and I think they went through still sin then to him,

1717
01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:59.000
you know,
so I,
I mean,
I'm not going to say I got one or two things on,

1718
01:45:59.001 --> 01:46:01.640
which was great.
You know,
fucking,

1719
01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:06.980
I just wrote for the comedy Central Roast for Bieber and I'm not a right or like

1720
01:46:06.981 --> 01:46:09.210
that.
Bonnie's to right.
Bonnie can write you,

1721
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:12.950
you want something fucking written us Bonnie,
she'll fucking write a book.

1722
01:46:14.090 --> 01:46:17.930
I mean,
just big how to write.
Uh,
I'm not,
yeah,

1723
01:46:18.980 --> 01:46:23.930
he knows how to write.
Right.
So,
but row stuff,
I can come up with some stuff,

1724
01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:27.190
you know,
and,
and punching up,
I can,
I'm good at,

1725
01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:30.080
because I could see from my,
you know,

1726
01:46:30.410 --> 01:46:34.270
just from being a standup for 30 years and watching,
you know,
uh,

1727
01:46:34.340 --> 01:46:38.090
that there was certain things that Chris goes,
yeah,
that's right.
You know,

1728
01:46:38.091 --> 01:46:41.420
and the other comics,
yeah,
he's smart.
Christmas smart.
He has,

1729
01:46:41.930 --> 01:46:45.650
he keeps funny people around him to tell him,

1730
01:46:46.580 --> 01:46:47.351
you know what I mean?

1731
01:46:47.351 --> 01:46:50.040
But that's one of the reasons why he's careers lasted so long.
He said

1732
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:52.680
<v 3>he's open minded like that,
you know,
cause there's a,</v>

1733
01:46:52.681 --> 01:46:55.500
there's a big drop off in a lot of people's acts,
you know,

1734
01:46:55.501 --> 01:46:58.380
you'll see like early sets are really,
really good and then you know,

1735
01:46:58.381 --> 01:46:59.970
as it gets they get older and older,

1736
01:46:59.971 --> 01:47:02.700
they become almost like a caricature of themselves.
Kennison has always,

1737
01:47:02.701 --> 01:47:05.250
my best example of that,
I can listen,

1738
01:47:05.310 --> 01:47:09.810
I think in 86 is if it wasn't the greatest of all time.
He's like,

1739
01:47:10.020 --> 01:47:11.470
it's him and prior.
Yeah.

1740
01:47:11.550 --> 01:47:14.640
I feel like from 86 to 88 he was the greatest of all time.

1741
01:47:14.850 --> 01:47:18.990
I mean he was on monster and people,
people who are alive today,

1742
01:47:19.230 --> 01:47:20.970
you have to look at him and perspective.

1743
01:47:20.971 --> 01:47:24.750
You have to look at in perspective of what was around back then there was

1744
01:47:24.751 --> 01:47:29.400
nothing like that.
Then he came out of nowhere and he just didn't last.

1745
01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:32.910
The,
the stuff that he put out before his death was dog shit.

1746
01:47:32.911 --> 01:47:36.810
It was like an open Mike or doing an impression of Kinison and it was terrible.

1747
01:47:36.980 --> 01:47:40.350
You know what I did?
I heard one of those albums and I'm going to what?

1748
01:47:41.770 --> 01:47:46.460
<v 2>Uh,
but he was way ahead of his time,
you know,</v>

1749
01:47:46.461 --> 01:47:49.280
when it came to such edgy,

1750
01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:50.780
<v 3>teary.
Oh,</v>

1751
01:47:50.780 --> 01:47:55.330
he just was doing coke and partying and hanging out and does,

1752
01:47:55.331 --> 01:47:57.530
this wasn't a lot of writing going on.
And who also,

1753
01:47:57.531 --> 01:48:00.650
I'm sure there's a lot of yes.
Men in his fucking corner all.
Yeah,

1754
01:48:00.810 --> 01:48:02.870
because all those guys were like,

1755
01:48:02.871 --> 01:48:05.660
when Jenny and Jenny worked with them on a specials too.
Right.

1756
01:48:05.661 --> 01:48:07.840
Didn't he work with them on soda?
Who worked with him?

1757
01:48:08.780 --> 01:48:10.670
I was always at fascinating,
like how they did that.

1758
01:48:10.671 --> 01:48:12.940
If they sat in a room and went over material.

1759
01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:15.880
<v 2>I've seen Chris Prepare,
I've seen him come down.</v>

1760
01:48:16.180 --> 01:48:20.560
I was at bananas one night on a weekend,
the one in Jersey,

1761
01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:25.630
and I saw him after he goes,
so you're up and down and this this weekend.
I go,

1762
01:48:25.631 --> 01:48:29.110
do you want,
if you want to stop stopping.
And you know,
he stopped in on Saturday,

1763
01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:32.860
this was two years ago and did 45 minutes,

1764
01:48:33.130 --> 01:48:36.240
but he was working out stuff,
you know,

1765
01:48:36.270 --> 01:48:39.460
it was all new stuff.
So when stopping him,

1766
01:48:39.461 --> 01:48:41.920
is he doing it after your set or some point?
We went on before me.

1767
01:48:41.921 --> 01:48:44.870
He went on and the host.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Shopping.

1768
01:48:45.010 --> 01:48:48.180
So you wait like an extra 45 minutes for you go.
Yeah,
no big deal.

1769
01:48:48.181 --> 01:48:51.100
It's Chris Riley.
Well the we the middle,
we took off the show,

1770
01:48:51.790 --> 01:48:56.320
we took the middle off and the host did like,
you know,

1771
01:48:56.321 --> 01:49:00.940
maybe in the middle did five minutes,
whatever.
And then Chris came in and did,

1772
01:49:00.941 --> 01:49:04.930
you know,
cause he doesn't want to hang out and fall,
wait for me to be get done.

1773
01:49:05.310 --> 01:49:06.460
He wants to get in and get out.

1774
01:49:06.461 --> 01:49:11.461
So he went on and it was pretty much new stuff and some kills.

1775
01:49:12.721 --> 01:49:17.590
I mean,
you know,
you know when you're Chris Rock and your Seinfeld or,
or Lilly,

1776
01:49:17.890 --> 01:49:18.723
you have a,

1777
01:49:18.940 --> 01:49:23.680
I guess a three minute pass to walk on stage and the audience is like,

1778
01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:27.970
oh,
but you have to be funny after,

1779
01:49:27.971 --> 01:49:31.990
after you get that right,
her scope,
the fucking show,
just stop.
Just stop.

1780
01:49:32.020 --> 01:49:36.550
Just pay attention,
just talk.
So you know what I mean?
There's,

1781
01:49:36.780 --> 01:49:41.760
you get a free few minutes pass.
But even with this new stuff,
he would,

1782
01:49:41.780 --> 01:49:46.510
he was,
it was almost honed.
So he had it,
you know,

1783
01:49:46.660 --> 01:49:48.920
and would see Chris walk up to the seller,

1784
01:49:48.940 --> 01:49:52.270
come in when he's working on a new walk in with this notebook,
put it down,

1785
01:49:52.660 --> 01:49:56.710
you know,
and just,
and he would still own stuffing to,
you know,

1786
01:49:56.790 --> 01:50:00.730
kind of get to calm to keep the crowd going,
you know,
and,
and,
but,

1787
01:50:00.820 --> 01:50:05.620
but you watch them and,
and,
and it's brilliant.

1788
01:50:05.620 --> 01:50:09.370
But the thing I love about love that he loves comedy.

1789
01:50:09.410 --> 01:50:13.450
He knows comedy.
Like we'll sit and talk and like,
we'll say Rita Rudner,

1790
01:50:13.451 --> 01:50:17.250
he'll go one of the best joke writers ever,
and she is a great coke writer.

1791
01:50:17.290 --> 01:50:20.500
Read a runner,
knows how to write a joke,
you know,
and,

1792
01:50:20.650 --> 01:50:25.210
and Chris knows fucking comedy.
He could talk.
He said to my wife,
he goes,
look,

1793
01:50:25.211 --> 01:50:26.530
if you have a fucking hour,

1794
01:50:26.531 --> 01:50:30.040
good material and you're female and you're not famous,
something's fucking wrong.

1795
01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:35.440
You know,
you know what I'm saying?
You know,
for a female,

1796
01:50:35.441 --> 01:50:39.580
a good hour,
you know,
he knows comedy,

1797
01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:43.840
he fucking loves comedy.
And that's why I love being with Bonnie.

1798
01:50:43.870 --> 01:50:48.580
She loves comedy.
She knows comedy.
She could break down and see,

1799
01:50:48.581 --> 01:50:51.440
you know what's good and what's bad and what's hack.

1800
01:50:51.460 --> 01:50:56.290
She'll tell me you can't do that.
Do you write like in front of a computer,

1801
01:50:56.300 --> 01:50:59.590
on a piece of paper,
just write on stage.
It just got to come to me on stage.

1802
01:50:59.591 --> 01:51:03.940
Like I,
I have this,
my,

1803
01:51:04.180 --> 01:51:09.180
the best bit I read recently came to me from being on stage and it was,

1804
01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:15.200
it's a kid,
it just kills.
It just fucking kills.
So I'm opening my hour.

1805
01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:18.460
It,
you don't ever try to like sit down in front of a computer.
Never.

1806
01:51:18.461 --> 01:51:22.210
Never in a million.
If I was writing for like tough crowd or unread,

1807
01:51:22.220 --> 01:51:25.330
I or you know when I was on one of those round tables,
yeah,

1808
01:51:25.331 --> 01:51:28.300
you gotta write fucking dumb jokes.
And even for red,
I'd barely,

1809
01:51:28.301 --> 01:51:32.860
I bite align and hopefully I can ad Lib my way through the show because you
know,

1810
01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:36.520
it's fucking the day I'm not getting paid.
Anyhow,
so I went to fuck how much,

1811
01:51:36.700 --> 01:51:41.560
but with tough crowd you would,
or I'd wrote,
I wrote stuff that Fox News show.

1812
01:51:41.630 --> 01:51:44.560
Yeah,
the late at night.
Now it's a round table.

1813
01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:48.840
Do you feel my lit at night to not a film at eight eight eight eight eight eight

1814
01:51:48.890 --> 01:51:52.780
8:00 PM Oh and it comes on at night.
[inaudible] it's a good show for what it is.

1815
01:51:52.781 --> 01:51:55.750
It's,
you know,
Bonnie's guest hosting it tonight.

1816
01:51:56.170 --> 01:51:59.530
She's host guest hosts saying she'll be on tonight.
I've never watched it.

1817
01:51:59.531 --> 01:52:00.161
I've only seen them.

1818
01:52:00.161 --> 01:52:03.490
I've seen a couple of clips of comics on it or people saying controversial

1819
01:52:03.491 --> 01:52:06.410
things on it,
but I've never understood what it is.
It's like,
it's it,

1820
01:52:06.430 --> 01:52:10.810
it's like any of the other round table show.
It's like Fox News.
Yeah.

1821
01:52:10.811 --> 01:52:14.800
I used to do jewelry pay harm when she was on CNN and that was round table,

1822
01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:19.450
you know.
Uh,
she's a bright woman.
She's fucking smart by very bright,

1823
01:52:19.510 --> 01:52:24.190
but she's so left.
Look when you're so left and so right to me.

1824
01:52:24.750 --> 01:52:29.740
Uh,
it,
a lot of it,
you become delusional.

1825
01:52:29.770 --> 01:52:31.900
Well,
it gets,
you can't ideological look,

1826
01:52:31.901 --> 01:52:36.040
you're locked into a rigid way of thank you.
Got You got to have a bending point.

1827
01:52:36.520 --> 01:52:40.990
It can't be all white and black.
It just can't be what it is.
Like her big issues.

1828
01:52:41.050 --> 01:52:43.630
Well,
I mean she's just so left.

1829
01:52:43.750 --> 01:52:48.560
She hates to write Bush.
Everything he did was completely wrong.

1830
01:52:48.561 --> 01:52:50.660
Everything Obama does this completely right.

1831
01:52:50.720 --> 01:52:55.310
So she's an Obama supporter even after all these years.
Well they like I've seen,

1832
01:52:55.311 --> 01:52:56.960
I haven't done her showing so long,

1833
01:52:56.961 --> 01:53:01.340
but she's very left wing and she's now,

1834
01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:05.330
no it's gone.
But she was so pro comic and show,

1835
01:53:06.260 --> 01:53:09.380
you know,
I mean uh,
her show,
she had comics on all the time.

1836
01:53:09.381 --> 01:53:13.760
I did her show 23 times,
you know,
two emails.

1837
01:53:14.060 --> 01:53:16.320
Uh,
she sent you two emails?
No,

1838
01:53:16.340 --> 01:53:19.940
from fans you got now I always know my,

1839
01:53:19.941 --> 01:53:24.050
her fan base was a little older.
They don't get online.
Not,
they don't go there.

1840
01:53:24.051 --> 01:53:25.430
Don't fucking write emails.
You,

1841
01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:28.760
you get emails from niche from both Democrats that live in the cities.

1842
01:53:28.761 --> 01:53:32.210
That what it is.
Yeah.
I got to email me.
You are funny.

1843
01:53:33.410 --> 01:53:38.390
But she,
she's pro comic.
She was great.
Our movie,
she did our movie.

1844
01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:40.670
Uh,
you know,

1845
01:53:40.671 --> 01:53:45.110
so her red eye is basically that type of show to me.
You know,

1846
01:53:46.220 --> 01:53:49.160
you know,
people say Bill Maher's show was to first,

1847
01:53:49.550 --> 01:53:53.450
but tough crowd was a whole,
it was to first at what

1848
01:53:55.060 --> 01:54:00.060
of comics pretty much saying what they wanted to say and saying what you

1849
01:54:00.191 --> 01:54:05.191
couldn't say on other shows and not only disagree in which somebody smacking

1850
01:54:06.771 --> 01:54:10.810
them around a little for being stupid.
Okay.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

1851
01:54:10.811 --> 01:54:14.530
It was a great show.
It was,
why don't they read?
We bring that day.
It just,

1852
01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:19.350
it tough crowd to bring it back.
I mean Collin Quinn still alive.
Yeah.
Look,

1853
01:54:19.351 --> 01:54:22.900
the fuck is he doing a podcast because it can even be a good podcast.

1854
01:54:22.901 --> 01:54:25.570
Tough crowd podcast.
Honig great.
Collin puts out,

1855
01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:29.980
Collin puts out one man shows he he's working on his next one.

1856
01:54:29.981 --> 01:54:34.450
He did a unconstitutionally did uh,
the one before it.

1857
01:54:34.720 --> 01:54:37.110
Does he like doing that better than stand up?
Well,

1858
01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:40.720
I guess he's so fucking brilliant,
man.
He just,

1859
01:54:41.380 --> 01:54:43.750
I guess stand up is too easy.

1860
01:54:43.751 --> 01:54:48.751
Forum or he's not saying anything he wants to say like he's doing in these one

1861
01:54:49.061 --> 01:54:53.620
man shows,
you know,
and it stands is confined by the,
the desire to get,
you know,

1862
01:54:53.621 --> 01:54:57.180
you have to get laughs every x amount of second and also too.

1863
01:54:58.760 --> 01:54:59.593
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1864
01:54:59.610 --> 01:55:02.070
<v 2>He could go into theaters and do these shows.</v>

1865
01:55:02.460 --> 01:55:06.080
You can't do these shows and comedy clubs really.
Right.
You know,

1866
01:55:06.090 --> 01:55:09.780
that's a different kind of structure.
It's a whole different thing.
And you know,

1867
01:55:09.781 --> 01:55:13.250
he,
he's,
I just talked to him when I was driving here.
He and I go,

1868
01:55:13.260 --> 01:55:16.860
you done with your thing?
He goes,
yeah,
and a book deal.
You know,

1869
01:55:16.861 --> 01:55:20.340
he's done with his book,
but the guys always fucking creating,

1870
01:55:20.700 --> 01:55:25.020
he's always creating a,
she a happy guy.

1871
01:55:25.810 --> 01:55:28.980
I Thi I think he's really centered,
you know,

1872
01:55:28.981 --> 01:55:33.540
I think he's really centered because I called them the Bouche something one day

1873
01:55:33.541 --> 01:55:37.320
that I was really fucking torn apart about.
Or uh,
he goes,

1874
01:55:37.321 --> 01:55:41.710
you did you go to a meeting or whatever.
I say,
he goes,
yeah,

1875
01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:44.130
see it's all bullshit.

1876
01:55:44.490 --> 01:55:48.090
Go fucking get in touch with what's really bothering you.

1877
01:55:48.230 --> 01:55:49.063
And you know what I mean?

1878
01:55:49.230 --> 01:55:53.610
So he's pretty centered as a person and I think he's uh,

1879
01:55:54.150 --> 01:55:58.170
uh,
I think he's comfortable in his own skin.

1880
01:55:58.710 --> 01:56:03.360
You know what I mean?
Like,
so many people are not comfortable,
you know,

1881
01:56:03.361 --> 01:56:05.540
and they're hiding and are,
well that's her way.

1882
01:56:05.541 --> 01:56:09.360
She's really good at like playing that silly part on Twitter.

1883
01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:12.240
Like if you go to Taco to call it Quinn's Twitter,

1884
01:56:12.500 --> 01:56:16.150
if you don't understand his sense of humor,
people like words.
The funny I,

1885
01:56:16.310 --> 01:56:19.470
you know,
I'm not seeing how you're funny.
Like,
you know,
you don't,

1886
01:56:19.650 --> 01:56:23.520
you're missing what he's doing and he doesn't try to convert those people ever.

1887
01:56:23.550 --> 01:56:27.090
No,
you don't see them arguing with them.
He doesn't block them like I will.

1888
01:56:27.180 --> 01:56:28.620
He's fucking,
he's,

1889
01:56:29.010 --> 01:56:34.010
it's so they don't get the fact that he's making fun of everything and he's

1890
01:56:35.761 --> 01:56:38.430
playing a character.
I'm there like,
so fucking,

1891
01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:42.720
they had a big article in New York Times about him on Twitter.
How,
how,

1892
01:56:42.780 --> 01:56:44.640
how good he is on Twitter.

1893
01:56:45.150 --> 01:56:50.010
He's like the number one I heard dorm.
I haven't fought her nor Mcdonald's.

1894
01:56:50.220 --> 01:56:55.100
Really funny.
He does golf play by play.
Golf.
I haven't really,

1895
01:56:55.101 --> 01:56:59.140
I heard a fucking brilliant,
no,
it was just funny.
He figured,
uh,

1896
01:56:59.340 --> 01:57:03.360
so he had Collin.
So probably the reason to show never came back.

1897
01:57:03.361 --> 01:57:07.650
Well one,
it leaned a little to the right.

1898
01:57:09.180 --> 01:57:12.840
You know,
I mean Nick Lean to the right column.
Lean to the right.

1899
01:57:13.380 --> 01:57:17.580
I Guess Geraldo was neutral.
He was a little more left.
Yeah,
he was who?
Geraldo.

1900
01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:18.550
He was left heroes.

1901
01:57:18.550 --> 01:57:22.590
The last little left Norton's a little right was at the time a little trite.

1902
01:57:22.630 --> 01:57:26.880
Norns more neutral.
Now I was more to the right then,

1903
01:57:26.881 --> 01:57:30.840
but I'm neutral now.
Well I think with Norton laws,
well he was a,
and still is.

1904
01:57:30.841 --> 01:57:35.380
I think he's anti the hypocrisy of the left.
That's what I completely,

1905
01:57:35.570 --> 01:57:38.150
their heads the hip because it's like all the idea.

1906
01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:42.000
If you put it on paper and you had a checklist of what do you actually support?

1907
01:57:42.270 --> 01:57:45.480
Gay Marriage check,
you know,
racially quality check,

1908
01:57:45.481 --> 01:57:48.120
like all the things that the left pushes for.

1909
01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:50.100
I'm in their corner on almost all of it.

1910
01:57:50.430 --> 01:57:53.310
But then it gets to certain things that you just go,

1911
01:57:53.311 --> 01:57:57.240
well you guys are just silly.
You know,
like there's,
there's certain aspects of,

1912
01:57:57.510 --> 01:58:01.470
of the Eni all laughter,
all right.
Ideology.

1913
01:58:01.530 --> 01:58:02.700
It's like you can't,

1914
01:58:02.701 --> 01:58:05.940
like the worst thing to me is what I'm talking to someone and they talk about

1915
01:58:05.941 --> 01:58:09.210
the Democrats.
Like,
look,
we got to win in 2016 like what does this,

1916
01:58:09.211 --> 01:58:12.390
we are you are you,
are you running for president?

1917
01:58:12.790 --> 01:58:15.750
We got to win I guess as a team for you.

1918
01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:19.020
And then you realize what kind of is a team for that.
Yeah.
It becomes this,

1919
01:58:19.220 --> 01:58:22.380
you know,
patriots versus the fucking Steelers or something.
It just gets,

1920
01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:27.210
it gets to one of those things people voted for Obama.

1921
01:58:29.410 --> 01:58:33.280
See a lot of young,
if you're under 25 you're not supposed to,
you,

1922
01:58:33.330 --> 01:58:35.650
you shouldn't have a point of view.
Shut your fucking mouth.

1923
01:58:35.651 --> 01:58:38.200
You haven't lived long enough to know.

1924
01:58:38.230 --> 01:58:42.010
You probably shouldn't be able to vote unless,
unless you could write

1925
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:46.330
<v 3>a paper explaining why you,
you,</v>

1926
01:58:46.410 --> 01:58:51.100
you want Obama or this guy and then you can have it read by people who,
you know,

1927
01:58:51.690 --> 01:58:55.750
have the brain,
have life experiences.
But that doesn't make sense either because,

1928
01:58:56.440 --> 01:58:58.300
well,
people,
people when he won,

1929
01:58:58.610 --> 01:59:01.750
which people wanted something different,

1930
01:59:02.020 --> 01:59:05.760
but people voted the first selection out of emotions,

1931
01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:09.580
not out of an intellect.
Well,
I thought he was good out of intellect.

1932
01:59:09.610 --> 01:59:13.660
I thought he was good.
First of all,
he was so much more articulate than Bush.

1933
01:59:13.930 --> 01:59:16.840
He was so much money against Bush,
but it doesn't matter.

1934
01:59:16.841 --> 01:59:19.360
It's like coming back from that and it's like,
okay,

1935
01:59:19.361 --> 01:59:23.440
now we have someone who actually can talk.
He's obviously brilliant.
Uh,

1936
01:59:23.441 --> 01:59:26.080
he's a very smart person.
And his ideas,

1937
01:59:26.081 --> 01:59:30.190
like the idea is about closing Guantanamo Bay,
getting into this happened wars.

1938
01:59:30.191 --> 01:59:32.500
No,
it didn't,
you know,
but,
but that's what you learn.

1939
01:59:32.620 --> 01:59:36.490
You learn from a guy like Obama that it doesn't matter that this,

1940
01:59:36.730 --> 01:59:38.680
that the what really,

1941
01:59:38.720 --> 01:59:43.720
what politics really all about is about stroking the back of the people that got

1942
01:59:44.201 --> 01:59:48.410
you there.
It's a business.
What you gotta do to keep your business running.
Yeah.

1943
01:59:48.450 --> 01:59:51.880
Okay.
Farrakhan is a fucking brilliant speaker.

1944
01:59:52.450 --> 01:59:56.080
Farrakhan is a Greg,
you ever heard him speak?
He's a great speaker.

1945
01:59:56.290 --> 01:59:58.780
He fucking captivates.
He,

1946
01:59:58.810 --> 02:00:03.370
he keeps you let you know.
So,
uh,

1947
02:00:04.030 --> 02:00:05.470
but what are they saying?

1948
02:00:05.920 --> 02:00:10.600
What is any politician saying that hasn't been fucking said before?
Not much.

1949
02:00:10.690 --> 02:00:15.610
Okay.
They're saying the same thing in a different uh,
change.
Yeah.

1950
02:00:15.611 --> 02:00:18.100
Well,
of course everybody wants to fucking change.

1951
02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:22.310
Nobody's fucking happy that uh,
the,
you know,

1952
02:00:23.050 --> 02:00:24.610
mortgages are sky high.

1953
02:00:24.611 --> 02:00:28.120
Interest rates are fucking less than half a percent.

1954
02:00:28.390 --> 02:00:32.680
Nobody wants to let you know at times a gas prices were $4 a gallon.
Yeah,

1955
02:00:32.681 --> 02:00:36.460
of course you want change,
but all that other stuff is bullshit.

1956
02:00:36.490 --> 02:00:41.350
It's all bullshit.
It's just damn trying to keep their business fucking running.

1957
02:00:41.720 --> 02:00:45.100
My business involves having people donate money to them to get them into office.

1958
02:00:45.130 --> 02:00:47.590
Yeah.
And then keeping those people happy once they get in office.
I mean,

1959
02:00:47.591 --> 02:00:51.640
that's what we found out about Bama.
Bama,
if you look at him on paper,

1960
02:00:51.641 --> 02:00:54.700
first of all,
the stuff that he's done against whistle blowers,

1961
02:00:54.701 --> 02:00:56.860
that was a whole part of his campaign that if we,

1962
02:00:57.070 --> 02:01:01.840
if someone comes forward exposing illegal activity,
we will protect them.

1963
02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:04.750
I mean,
that was a part of the,
we are change website.
They,

1964
02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:08.620
they redacted that from the website in light of the Edward Snowden,

1965
02:01:10.630 --> 02:01:15.360
Chelsea handler shit.
All Chelsea handler,
Chelsea Manning,
uh,

1966
02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:19.290
what she take Chelsea shirt again.
No,

1967
02:01:19.300 --> 02:01:22.750
that's how strong Chelsea handler is as a personality.
You say the word Chelsea,

1968
02:01:22.751 --> 02:01:24.790
you have to say [inaudible] handler after it.

1969
02:01:25.170 --> 02:01:29.560
Not even Clinton and Chelsea Clinton.
Um,
you know,
uh,

1970
02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:32.350
all that shit that happened with wikileaks,
you know,

1971
02:01:32.790 --> 02:01:37.300
it's the idea that they're protecting whistle blowers has been,

1972
02:01:37.750 --> 02:01:40.220
it's been debunked.
I mean,
there's none of that.
I mean,

1973
02:01:40.221 --> 02:01:43.100
that was part of the promise that they were saying in an office.

1974
02:01:43.101 --> 02:01:45.650
Like if people come forth and expose the illegal activity,

1975
02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:48.440
we're going to protect them.
Well,
they did and you didn't.

1976
02:01:48.620 --> 02:01:52.160
And that was a core component of what people were looking forward from him,

1977
02:01:52.161 --> 02:01:54.980
that he was going to be different than these fucking criminals that were in

1978
02:01:54.981 --> 02:01:56.410
charge before he was in there.
Right.

1979
02:01:56.650 --> 02:01:58.000
<v 2>Fucking the FBI,</v>

1980
02:01:58.090 --> 02:02:03.090
even your local detective is not going to fucking burned or informants because

1981
02:02:04.450 --> 02:02:08.540
there were informants are,
what are you giving them numbers?
Uh,

1982
02:02:08.630 --> 02:02:13.630
<v 3>but the problem is that these guys with Edward Snowden did with Chelsea manning</v>

1983
02:02:14.070 --> 02:02:18.950
did,
was expose them and you know,
that's the government,

1984
02:02:18.951 --> 02:02:20.420
that's the very people that he works for us.

1985
02:02:20.421 --> 02:02:23.750
The idea of whistle blowers wasn't nearly as attractive when they're blowing the

1986
02:02:23.751 --> 02:02:25.620
whistle on the actual government themselves.

1987
02:02:26.030 --> 02:02:30.940
Leveling whistleblowing on corporations are whistle blowing on,
you know,
the,
the,

1988
02:02:30.941 --> 02:02:33.560
the people that fucking spilled the oil out in the middle of the Gulf coast.

1989
02:02:33.561 --> 02:02:38.060
It was,
yeah,
it was the actual government itself,
the NSA,
the CIA,

1990
02:02:38.061 --> 02:02:38.630
and they were like,

1991
02:02:38.630 --> 02:02:40.190
<v 2>do you think since he's been,
I mean,</v>

1992
02:02:40.220 --> 02:02:42.520
since he's been in an office and this is right.

1993
02:02:42.530 --> 02:02:47.530
I mean racial divide has grown I think immensely since he's been at all.

1994
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:53.760
<v 3>Cause I needed some ways,
but in some ways it's actually come around.</v>

1995
02:02:53.761 --> 02:02:54.750
I think people are,
are,

1996
02:02:54.870 --> 02:02:59.160
are United in a sense and a lot of ways because they realize how much racism

1997
02:02:59.161 --> 02:03:02.430
there really is,
how much racism black people have to deal with.

1998
02:03:02.431 --> 02:03:03.480
And it comes to the police.

1999
02:03:03.630 --> 02:03:06.660
When you watch all these videos of black people being harassed by the cops or

2000
02:03:06.661 --> 02:03:09.390
beaten up by the cops or the Eric Gardner guy getting choked to death,

2001
02:03:09.430 --> 02:03:11.280
he articulates.
It should never happen,

2002
02:03:12.510 --> 02:03:14.910
but it probably wouldn't happen if that was a white guy in a suit.

2003
02:03:14.911 --> 02:03:15.960
And we all know that.
Yep.

2004
02:03:16.020 --> 02:03:20.730
<v 2>But we know of.
Okay.
But you know,</v>

2005
02:03:20.790 --> 02:03:23.850
as much as the media exploits every now,

2006
02:03:23.970 --> 02:03:28.970
every fucking time you see now there's a cop doing something wrong or doing this

2007
02:03:29.401 --> 02:03:33.180
wrong or you're not seeing,
uh,
you know,

2008
02:03:33.330 --> 02:03:37.500
for fucking criminals walking down the street,

2009
02:03:37.530 --> 02:03:42.210
you don't know if they're fucking pack in a weapon.
You don't see them harass.

2010
02:03:42.390 --> 02:03:47.390
It's all right now with selling fucking papers and we're saying papers loosely

2011
02:03:48.450 --> 02:03:53.130
is what are the cops doing to black people?
That's what's selling right now.

2012
02:03:53.290 --> 02:03:54.750
That's what's headlines are.

2013
02:03:54.960 --> 02:03:59.290
And it may look as many bad cops and,

2014
02:03:59.291 --> 02:04:04.290
and you know,
it's maybe one out of 21 out.
Uh,

2015
02:04:04.590 --> 02:04:08.070
you know,
the percentages,
dis,
you know,
like this display,
the,

2016
02:04:08.071 --> 02:04:11.070
I didn't see the documentary made a documentary about Aa.

2017
02:04:11.550 --> 02:04:14.730
All the predators in Aa,
all the uh,
you know,

2018
02:04:14.731 --> 02:04:17.310
the criminals and this and that and people take an advantage.

2019
02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:22.050
Well you guess what?
You got fucking people,
people in,
you know,

2020
02:04:22.051 --> 02:04:27.051
you got peoples in rooms that were fucking ex ex heroin addicts in and out of

2021
02:04:28.681 --> 02:04:32.960
jail.
Some killers suddenness yeah,
there's gonna be some,

2022
02:04:33.140 --> 02:04:36.780
<v 3>well,
you're dealing with millions and millions of people here.</v>

2023
02:04:37.050 --> 02:04:37.883
Look at it this way.

2024
02:04:37.890 --> 02:04:41.970
How many people do you think get arrested by the cops or have interaction with

2025
02:04:41.971 --> 02:04:45.300
the cops every fucking day of the week?
Across the entire country.

2026
02:04:45.540 --> 02:04:49.260
It's got to be in the hundreds of thousands of interactions every day.

2027
02:04:49.320 --> 02:04:53.070
So these glaring instances,
like the guy in South Carolina that's shot,

2028
02:04:53.071 --> 02:04:57.840
that guy fucked up,
unbelievably fucked up.
What happened in Baltimore?
Fucked,

2029
02:04:57.841 --> 02:05:02.670
fucked up.
What happened in Ferguson?
Fucked up those fucked up instances.

2030
02:05:03.060 --> 02:05:07.920
Those become like something that they can focus on because those are,

2031
02:05:07.921 --> 02:05:08.754
those are these,

2032
02:05:08.940 --> 02:05:13.860
these blips and they're in the overall scheme of things in comparison to how

2033
02:05:13.861 --> 02:05:17.170
many interactions people actually have with the cops.
The,

2034
02:05:17.171 --> 02:05:21.180
the amount of times people get shot in those situations are fairly small,

2035
02:05:21.420 --> 02:05:25.620
but we're dealing with hundreds of millions of people and the interactions of

2036
02:05:25.621 --> 02:05:29.040
hundreds of millions of people on a daily basis and you're going to find things

2037
02:05:29.041 --> 02:05:31.700
to focus on.
Does it mean there's no problem now?

2038
02:05:31.710 --> 02:05:34.950
It's definitely a fucking problem if those,
if one of those things happen,

2039
02:05:35.220 --> 02:05:40.220
that's a problem that that one instance is a problem getting a Staten Island was

2040
02:05:40.261 --> 02:05:43.440
unwatched.
Which ones is to have the choke?
The,
she was recording.

2041
02:05:43.650 --> 02:05:44.610
I'm fucking Wanky,

2042
02:05:45.510 --> 02:05:49.950
but do you think the cops went in there with the mindset,

2043
02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:53.880
I want to kill this guy?
Well,
they fucked up because they make,
they were getting,

2044
02:05:53.910 --> 02:05:57.870
well,
first of all,
they used cops to collect revenue.
That's a problem.

2045
02:05:58.020 --> 02:06:01.260
That's part of the problem and he's like,
they use cops to write tickets.

2046
02:06:01.261 --> 02:06:05.250
They use cops too to make arrest.
They have quotas that's fucked up.

2047
02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:08.430
They're doing that because they want to make money and they want these cops to

2048
02:06:08.431 --> 02:06:12.630
be profitable for them.
If no one did any crime,

2049
02:06:12.810 --> 02:06:15.930
what the fuck would cops do if they have quotas?
If there was no crime,

2050
02:06:16.110 --> 02:06:21.000
if the whole country agreed to have a moratorium on crime for like three weeks,

2051
02:06:21.210 --> 02:06:24.900
what the fuck would everybody do?
They would have to start planning crime.

2052
02:06:25.070 --> 02:06:27.630
They'd have to start freaking crime and arresting people for Shit.

2053
02:06:27.631 --> 02:06:30.450
That didn't happen.
But that's the same as saying if there was no fires,

2054
02:06:30.630 --> 02:06:31.530
firemen wouldn't know.

2055
02:06:31.531 --> 02:06:35.580
It's not because there's oftentimes no fires for years and no one ever talks

2056
02:06:35.581 --> 02:06:38.920
about like,
hey,
we don't need the fire department anymore anymore.

2057
02:06:39.030 --> 02:06:41.160
Everybody knows that fires are always possible,

2058
02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:45.120
so you want to keep a fire department.
If anybody ever ran for mayor said,

2059
02:06:45.270 --> 02:06:47.130
it's saying,
look,
we don't need a fire department.

2060
02:06:47.131 --> 02:06:49.200
Everybody just stopped playing with matches.
All right,
we're good.

2061
02:06:49.290 --> 02:06:51.470
We just cut money off the budget.
They would go,
Whoa,
what?

2062
02:06:51.471 --> 02:06:53.070
What the fuck are you talking about?

2063
02:06:53.220 --> 02:06:56.980
But the idea of having no cops because uh,

2064
02:06:56.981 --> 02:07:00.750
there was no crime would welcome that.
They would welcome that.
Like,
oh,

2065
02:07:00.751 --> 02:07:04.000
we don't need carbs.
There's no crime anymore.
Like you,
you can't,

2066
02:07:05.010 --> 02:07:08.520
you can't like force these people to make arrests.

2067
02:07:08.550 --> 02:07:10.980
And the idea of putting quotas on cops.

2068
02:07:11.190 --> 02:07:14.340
If you have lazy cops that don't go out and enforce the law,

2069
02:07:14.550 --> 02:07:16.320
well then you need to get better cops.

2070
02:07:16.440 --> 02:07:20.850
But what you can't do is you can't make people arrest people because if you make

2071
02:07:20.851 --> 02:07:21.481
people recipe,

2072
02:07:21.481 --> 02:07:25.380
well you're assuming someone's going to do something bad if no one did anything

2073
02:07:25.381 --> 02:07:28.890
bad.
Isn't that the whole point of having a police presence?

2074
02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:31.800
Like the whole point of having a police presence is people realize,

2075
02:07:31.830 --> 02:07:35.950
oh there's cops.
I don't want to do anything like that.
But if that happened,

2076
02:07:35.951 --> 02:07:38.710
those costs would be fuck.
Cause they have quotas,
you know,

2077
02:07:38.711 --> 02:07:40.510
and people tried to say there's no quotas.

2078
02:07:40.660 --> 02:07:45.400
Both course your shoulders traps and shit.
I know cops,
they tell me,

2079
02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:47.800
even if there's unwritten quotas,
there's quotas.

2080
02:07:47.801 --> 02:07:49.510
This pressure on them to arrest people.

2081
02:07:49.750 --> 02:07:53.400
And it's been proven time and time again does quotas.
And it's,

2082
02:07:53.430 --> 02:07:57.220
it varies by department.
It varies by city and state.

2083
02:07:57.310 --> 02:07:58.450
But without a doubt,

2084
02:07:58.510 --> 02:08:02.260
there's a lot of pressure on people to arrest people so they can get funding.

2085
02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:05.800
Yes,
yes,
of course.
I mean did they make money?
And these fucking,

2086
02:08:05.920 --> 02:08:10.590
these forfeiture asset forfeiture situations where people are getting their,

2087
02:08:10.610 --> 02:08:15.190
their money taken from him.
This fucking kid,
there was one on Amtrak.

2088
02:08:15.191 --> 02:08:20.191
The Dea is a catching people on Amtrak that cause some kid had money saved up.

2089
02:08:21.011 --> 02:08:24.460
He had $16,000 on him.
Clean,
clear criminal record,

2090
02:08:24.520 --> 02:08:28.420
no fucking history of drug sales,
no history of drug use.

2091
02:08:28.750 --> 02:08:33.340
He took his fucking money,
got to go to Amtrak.
Civil forfeiture.

2092
02:08:33.341 --> 02:08:37.720
The DEA is involved.
The civil forfeiture cases,
it's talking disgusting man.

2093
02:08:37.750 --> 02:08:38.740
Well here's one of them.

2094
02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:43.920
Rich land want four point $1 million police station funded by civil forfeiture.

2095
02:08:44.410 --> 02:08:47.440
You fucking criminals,
criminals.

2096
02:08:47.710 --> 02:08:51.220
You're stealing money from the people that you're supposed to be fucking

2097
02:08:51.221 --> 02:08:52.054
protecting.

2098
02:08:52.210 --> 02:08:55.450
They steal and then you have to take them to court and you have to try to get

2099
02:08:55.451 --> 02:08:56.320
that money back.

2100
02:08:57.070 --> 02:09:00.790
Even if somebody made money from selling drugs,

2101
02:09:00.791 --> 02:09:02.710
even if they made money from selling drugs,

2102
02:09:03.070 --> 02:09:07.990
that's not the fucking police department's money.
They can't take that money.

2103
02:09:08.140 --> 02:09:11.560
And by Margarita machines and all this shit they've been accused of doing,

2104
02:09:11.710 --> 02:09:14.200
cause that's what they have been.
They've been convicted of doing that.

2105
02:09:14.650 --> 02:09:19.120
It's awful.
Elisha,
a whole corrupt society.
I mean,
well,

2106
02:09:19.121 --> 02:09:21.520
it's corrupt because they've been allowed to be corrupt cause they've got

2107
02:09:21.550 --> 02:09:25.480
incompetent shitheads that are running these police departments and good cops or

2108
02:09:25.481 --> 02:09:27.160
forced into bad situations.

2109
02:09:27.370 --> 02:09:30.670
If you have it on the books that they're allowed to take money from people,

2110
02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:34.720
then it's up to their discretion and then you have these fucking idiots that you

2111
02:09:34.721 --> 02:09:34.871
know,

2112
02:09:34.871 --> 02:09:39.520
just decide to pull the trigger and you're going to have a certain amount of

2113
02:09:39.521 --> 02:09:44.020
idiots in any group of people.
If you have 500 people,
you've got five idiots.

2114
02:09:44.021 --> 02:09:48.040
No matter what you do,
no matter what you do,
you pull any 500 people,

2115
02:09:48.190 --> 02:09:52.240
five of them,
you're going to want to kill the fucking hammer.
They're assholes.

2116
02:09:52.300 --> 02:09:54.190
No matter what you do.
There's a certain amount of people,

2117
02:09:54.191 --> 02:09:56.740
they're just dumb as shit.
There's four initial,
meanwhile,

2118
02:09:56.741 --> 02:09:58.690
I know one of these and Nydia right hear me,

2119
02:09:59.950 --> 02:10:03.960
but I know occasionally sound like one.
Here's I.

2120
02:10:05.290 --> 02:10:07.200
You can't get it.
Like,
look,
if they want to put,

2121
02:10:07.210 --> 02:10:11.020
if they want to take your property and build a highway through your fucking

2122
02:10:11.021 --> 02:10:14.590
property,
they'll do it.
They're not going to do it.
They're not doing it anymore.

2123
02:10:14.710 --> 02:10:16.660
They're not doing it anymore because of stories like that,

2124
02:10:16.661 --> 02:10:19.240
because people find out about asset forfeiture,
they're just,

2125
02:10:19.330 --> 02:10:22.180
they're started to rescind those laws.
They're starting to pull those laws back.

2126
02:10:22.480 --> 02:10:24.550
They shouldn't just pull those ball,
but you're not get,
they should,

2127
02:10:24.700 --> 02:10:27.550
they should put everyone who fucking was a part of that in jail,

2128
02:10:27.730 --> 02:10:32.170
everyone will let people take some kids $16,000 and you make them go to court

2129
02:10:32.171 --> 02:10:36.230
for it and how much money costs to fight against and then the the do you have to

2130
02:10:36.231 --> 02:10:41.231
pull receipts for how you made that $16,000 this is supposed to be America.

2131
02:10:41.990 --> 02:10:44.780
Okay.
You're supposed to be innocent until proven guilty.

2132
02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:48.170
You find what's $16,000 isn't that much fucking money.

2133
02:10:48.410 --> 02:10:52.280
It's not like the guy had $2 billion in gold bullion.
Like where'd you get it?

2134
02:10:52.310 --> 02:10:55.970
Fuck you.
Okay.
You lose a settled down,
but you,

2135
02:10:55.971 --> 02:10:59.570
you might've done something illegal to get $2 billion.
You only 12 no,

2136
02:10:59.571 --> 02:11:04.070
this is a kid who earned money and they stole it from them because they decided

2137
02:11:04.071 --> 02:11:08.110
it was reasonably suspicious.
But you're going,
you're going for,

2138
02:11:08.210 --> 02:11:09.650
you're going from a whole different,

2139
02:11:09.651 --> 02:11:13.920
from the police officer on the street doing what they gotta do to,

2140
02:11:14.060 --> 02:11:19.060
to stop crime and keep stay alive to the bureaucrats that are passionate.

2141
02:11:19.071 --> 02:11:24.050
He's fucking laws and d they're just pawns to cops are just plunge into chess.

2142
02:11:24.160 --> 02:11:26.840
He may start out as pawns,
but somewhere along the line,

2143
02:11:26.841 --> 02:11:31.250
a lot of times they wind up being fucking legal criminals then wind up doing

2144
02:11:31.310 --> 02:11:35.300
illegal,
which should be illegal.
Shit.
Does legal have to club owners?

2145
02:11:35.301 --> 02:11:38.570
We were four shoulders fucking show shows you have to.

2146
02:11:38.571 --> 02:11:42.260
Corporations had one just got caught dumping,
you know,

2147
02:11:42.980 --> 02:11:44.640
they're all fucking,
you know,

2148
02:11:44.780 --> 02:11:49.250
bend a bank started biggest less than half a percent interest.

2149
02:11:49.251 --> 02:11:51.830
But when you're alone,
you take out a loan,
you're paying what,

2150
02:11:52.250 --> 02:11:56.230
four or 5% interest,
6% on a loan,
you know.

2151
02:11:56.720 --> 02:11:59.900
So you agree to do that.
I mean,
that's something you say,
well okay,

2152
02:11:59.901 --> 02:12:02.650
I'll agree to that.
You have no choice.

2153
02:12:02.651 --> 02:12:07.430
The choices to not get that loan industry that in someone's stealing your money

2154
02:12:07.431 --> 02:12:10.700
when they pull you over cause they decided and you shouldn't have $10,000 on
you.

2155
02:12:11.150 --> 02:12:14.150
You know like they've been doing that for a long time.

2156
02:12:14.151 --> 02:12:17.720
They've been pulling people over for a long time just taking their money because

2157
02:12:17.721 --> 02:12:18.800
if you have money on you,

2158
02:12:18.801 --> 02:12:21.170
you have to prove that you got that money through legal means.

2159
02:12:21.410 --> 02:12:23.900
That is bullshit and you know it's,

2160
02:12:23.930 --> 02:12:28.930
it's situations like that that engender or create this lack of trust in law

2161
02:12:30.771 --> 02:12:34.760
enforcement that you created an enemy.
You create an enemy in that kid.

2162
02:12:34.761 --> 02:12:38.330
That kid is going to distrust the DEA and the FBI and the CIA.

2163
02:12:38.350 --> 02:12:39.590
Anybody pulls him over,

2164
02:12:39.680 --> 02:12:43.550
he's going to distrust them forever because you ruined his life for a long

2165
02:12:43.551 --> 02:12:45.740
period of time.
The time he's got to go to court,

2166
02:12:45.870 --> 02:12:50.000
the sleepless nights he spent thinking of this smirking con that stole his

2167
02:12:50.001 --> 02:12:53.720
fucking money with a badge on that criminal with a fucking badge on.

2168
02:12:53.900 --> 02:12:54.733
But you know what?

2169
02:12:55.100 --> 02:13:00.100
Look I'm and even take money from me where it's talking about black people.

2170
02:13:01.460 --> 02:13:04.130
You can't even imagine a struggle because you're not black people,

2171
02:13:04.370 --> 02:13:06.780
white liberals,
all I know you're saying you don't know.

2172
02:13:07.340 --> 02:13:11.900
You don't know the struggles.
You don't leave the house every day in fear.
Okay.

2173
02:13:12.360 --> 02:13:15.440
And stop and Frisk.
Shit.
They were doing any work.

2174
02:13:15.470 --> 02:13:19.790
That's Dutch all being exploited because also,
and I agree,

2175
02:13:20.120 --> 02:13:24.050
I grew up in a black thing.
I seen it.
I don't,
I never felt it or lived it,

2176
02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:27.650
but I seen it.
Okay.
Cause it's actually why I grew up.
So I don't,
I don't,

2177
02:13:27.651 --> 02:13:31.860
I had the feeling of antisemitism that I,
that I could feel because that's

2178
02:13:32.550 --> 02:13:34.230
<v 0>what I see and feel.</v>

2179
02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:40.160
But you will never see the story of the cops that went in and stopped a gang war

2180
02:13:40.920 --> 02:13:44.340
or,
or,
or broke up,
uh,
broke up,
you know,
uh,

2181
02:13:44.360 --> 02:13:49.360
a husband from killing his fucking wife on a domestic call that saved his wife

2182
02:13:50.040 --> 02:13:54.870
and that family's lives and risk their lives and save two kids cause to fucking

2183
02:13:55.080 --> 02:13:59.340
father or even a mother.
Fucking lost to some Zoe,

2184
02:13:59.341 --> 02:14:02.370
some bureaucrats,
some dummy,
some administrator,
wherever the fuck.
Yeah.

2185
02:14:02.400 --> 02:14:05.880
Pass those regulations that allowed cops to steal money from people.

2186
02:14:06.030 --> 02:14:08.730
They're the problem.
You gave them legal power,

2187
02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.970
you gave him a green light and you made it where it's not even against the law.

2188
02:14:12.120 --> 02:14:14.130
And so they feel like they're justified in doing that.

2189
02:14:14.250 --> 02:14:17.760
You gotta be very careful of the power that you give people cause it's very

2190
02:14:17.761 --> 02:14:19.440
difficult to take that power back.

2191
02:14:19.620 --> 02:14:22.990
And it's also very difficult to take that righteous attitude like,
hey,

2192
02:14:23.020 --> 02:14:26.190
they have this attitude like what they're doing is just because it's legal

2193
02:14:26.370 --> 02:14:30.510
because they can't look at it objectively.
It's hard,
but don't you think

2194
02:14:32.310 --> 02:14:36.720
in the morning five cops,
you take five cops

2195
02:14:38.430 --> 02:14:41.400
roll call,
they listen.
Don't you think?

2196
02:14:42.420 --> 02:14:43.890
I don't know what percentage,
but I would,

2197
02:14:43.891 --> 02:14:48.891
let's even say seven out of 10 are not going five and then there's seven out of

2198
02:14:49.020 --> 02:14:52.620
10 [inaudible] per se.

2199
02:14:52.650 --> 02:14:57.630
Say whatever the percentage is that most of those cops aren't going to work on.

2200
02:14:57.780 --> 02:15:00.960
I'm going to find somebody and take money.
I would.
I would.

2201
02:15:01.050 --> 02:15:03.660
I would bet that most shows cops are gone.

2202
02:15:03.840 --> 02:15:06.870
I'm going to try to do something good today.
I'm going to try to,

2203
02:15:07.270 --> 02:15:08.910
I'm sure a lot of them.
Okay.
Um,

2204
02:15:09.060 --> 02:15:14.060
I'm sure it more are there to protect and serve then there are to fuck you over.

2205
02:15:15.890 --> 02:15:19.560
I,
and I'm pretty,
you know,
you know what I mean?
So the ones that are,

2206
02:15:19.561 --> 02:15:22.770
they're risking their lives because they are going to a job where they might not

2207
02:15:22.771 --> 02:15:26.610
come home.
They might not fucking come home.
Like I said it.
Well,
it's not them.

2208
02:15:26.850 --> 02:15:27.750
It's the fucking pattern.

2209
02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:32.550
I sent them the laws that passed laws that allow them to do these things.
Okay?

2210
02:15:32.551 --> 02:15:33.750
But the Lord is legal,

2211
02:15:33.780 --> 02:15:37.080
but Deloitte you're talking about is where they can take that money.
Jesus,

2212
02:15:37.081 --> 02:15:39.390
one of them.
Okay.
But he'll stop and frisk.
Okay.

2213
02:15:39.391 --> 02:15:41.940
Imagine if you're a black guy and you walk into New York and you've done nothing

2214
02:15:41.941 --> 02:15:46.010
wrong.
You're going to school and some asshole with a fucking,
you know,

2215
02:15:46.020 --> 02:15:49.440
a chip on his shoulder thinks it's okay for him to touch your body.

2216
02:15:49.500 --> 02:15:52.650
So rifling through your fucking pockets for no reason.

2217
02:15:52.710 --> 02:15:55.680
How may maybe calls you a racial slur in the process.

2218
02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:58.920
If you resist him and there's nothing,
not a goddamn thing you can do about it.

2219
02:15:58.921 --> 02:16:00.320
But do you don't think that happens in,

2220
02:16:00.570 --> 02:16:03.870
in white as a matter if it happens in white areas?

2221
02:16:03.871 --> 02:16:08.520
I'm just saying like that happening at all because you gave them the
possibility,

2222
02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:10.230
you let them on paper,

2223
02:16:10.290 --> 02:16:13.830
you made it legal for them to do that as soon as you make it legal for them to

2224
02:16:13.831 --> 02:16:17.250
do things that are inappropriate,
that don't make any sense.
Like if there's no,

2225
02:16:17.340 --> 02:16:21.130
there's no real reasonable like reason to,

2226
02:16:21.310 --> 02:16:24.780
to search something that are not in the middle of something criminal.

2227
02:16:24.810 --> 02:16:27.630
They're not doing anything suspicious.
They're just walking on the street.

2228
02:16:27.990 --> 02:16:31.510
That's discrimination and you're,
you're giving them a legal precedent.

2229
02:16:31.540 --> 02:16:36.310
You giving them a legal on paper reason to pull someone over and be a cunt.
Okay.

2230
02:16:36.910 --> 02:16:40.240
And you're right.
But how many,

2231
02:16:40.450 --> 02:16:44.940
how many uh,
Sherril killers,
how many rapists,

2232
02:16:44.980 --> 02:16:49.980
how many kidnappers have been caught due to profiling the FBI?

2233
02:16:52.210 --> 02:16:56.770
I mean that's not putting whole file is not,

2234
02:16:56.850 --> 02:17:01.850
yes it is profiling because they're looking at people like people all over for

2235
02:17:03.401 --> 02:17:07.150
stop and Frisk was and how do you know in Ohio that debt,

2236
02:17:07.300 --> 02:17:11.200
you're just lives in New York City law that stop and Frisk.

2237
02:17:11.201 --> 02:17:12.930
She's only in New York.
It was always,

2238
02:17:12.970 --> 02:17:17.560
that was where it was widely criticized and I'm sure cops do similar things in

2239
02:17:17.561 --> 02:17:19.450
other places,
but they stop you.
They,

2240
02:17:19.530 --> 02:17:21.910
if you're going through the fucking a Toledo,

2241
02:17:21.911 --> 02:17:26.911
Ohio and you see four white kids that look like trouble fit a profile,

2242
02:17:28.480 --> 02:17:31.420
cops will fuck with them.
Although asking me questions,

2243
02:17:31.421 --> 02:17:34.660
but they're not legally allowed to start searching through their pockets like

2244
02:17:34.661 --> 02:17:35.500
they were in New York,

2245
02:17:35.860 --> 02:17:38.920
what they were doing in New York that stop and Frisk Shit is bullshit.

2246
02:17:39.250 --> 02:17:43.270
It's fucked.
Okay.
I don't know enough about it.
I don't know the crime statistics.

2247
02:17:43.510 --> 02:17:48.510
I do do believe in certain types of profiling,

2248
02:17:48.910 --> 02:17:51.040
but we wouldn't catch him.
You know,

2249
02:17:51.041 --> 02:17:53.530
all the terrorism that has been stopped in this country,

2250
02:17:53.650 --> 02:17:57.010
which we don't even know about and they're spending a lot.
Okay.

2251
02:17:57.011 --> 02:17:59.920
Since nine 11 day have caught a lot of fucking people.

2252
02:18:00.880 --> 02:18:04.390
They've also been trapped a lot of people and forced him to do and terrorist

2253
02:18:04.460 --> 02:18:07.810
like that guy in Dallas,
they took some way.
I was like mentally challenged.

2254
02:18:07.960 --> 02:18:10.110
They forced him into this situation where they,

2255
02:18:10.111 --> 02:18:14.620
they gave him a fake bomb and gave him like a cellular phone to detonate it.

2256
02:18:14.621 --> 02:18:18.220
And then as soon as he tried to detonate it,
they arrested him like,
yeah,
yeah.

2257
02:18:18.221 --> 02:18:21.620
It's a famous case.
The fucking,
they tricked this dummy and they,
they,

2258
02:18:21.621 --> 02:18:23.050
they talked to me,
he got it.

2259
02:18:23.051 --> 02:18:26.560
Probably would have never found the means or the resources to have this bomb in

2260
02:18:26.561 --> 02:18:30.280
the first place.
Now he's in jail for the rest of his life.
But wait,
was he,

2261
02:18:30.760 --> 02:18:35.160
he was willing to make that call and blow that Obama.
Okay,
well guess what,
they,

2262
02:18:35.240 --> 02:18:38.230
they,
you can convince people to join Scientology.

2263
02:18:38.350 --> 02:18:40.990
You can convince people once they joined Scientology,

2264
02:18:40.991 --> 02:18:43.930
should you arrest them for being retarded?
Okay,
here's,
you know,
he's,

2265
02:18:44.200 --> 02:18:45.820
I don't think it would,
I don't know the story,

2266
02:18:45.821 --> 02:18:50.680
but if a cop can convince some show can have fucking show Ken.

2267
02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:54.160
So true,
but shows a lot of idiots out there.

2268
02:18:54.430 --> 02:18:59.110
And guess what profiling is,
helps stopping those fucking idiots from,

2269
02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:03.490
from committing these fucking shows.
Just attack.
You can make that argument.

2270
02:19:03.520 --> 02:19:05.020
You could also make the argument that they're,

2271
02:19:05.021 --> 02:19:07.720
what they're doing is they're taking advantage of someone who's stupid and

2272
02:19:07.721 --> 02:19:08.260
they're,
they're,

2273
02:19:08.260 --> 02:19:12.790
they're being like very persuasive and they're getting some dummy to do

2274
02:19:12.791 --> 02:19:15.280
something you probably would have never done in the first place and may have

2275
02:19:15.281 --> 02:19:17.860
never even made contact with those kind of people in the first place.

2276
02:19:18.070 --> 02:19:20.530
Or people that have the resources to do those things.
And when,

2277
02:19:20.531 --> 02:19:23.900
and why would they pick somebody like that and let's do it was because we want

2278
02:19:23.901 --> 02:19:27.290
to make arrests that that's,
that's real.
It's a score keeping thing.

2279
02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:28.100
I mean they want to make

2280
02:19:28.100 --> 02:19:30.740
<v 3>arrests that a lot of them,
yes,</v>

2281
02:19:30.920 --> 02:19:33.950
a lot of them are trying to prevent crime and trying to do good.

2282
02:19:34.010 --> 02:19:37.100
The vast majority.
But the problem is there's a,

2283
02:19:37.130 --> 02:19:41.300
there's enough wiggle room there for assholes and assholes get involved in

2284
02:19:41.301 --> 02:19:42.950
police force in law enforcement,

2285
02:19:43.100 --> 02:19:46.640
and they fuck it up for everybody else because all the good cops,

2286
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:49.040
they have to think about that guy in South Carolina.

2287
02:19:49.041 --> 02:19:52.850
They shot that guy in the back of his running away.
He'll exactly that.

2288
02:19:52.960 --> 02:19:57.290
That becomes a bit,
how come you don't hear about the good cops?
No,
not even that.

2289
02:19:57.440 --> 02:19:58.820
How come you don't hear that?

2290
02:19:58.850 --> 02:20:02.030
What does this in 2012 New Yorkers are stopped by the police.

2291
02:20:02.090 --> 02:20:06.770
532,911 times in one year.

2292
02:20:07.010 --> 02:20:11.210
473,644 we'll totally innocent.

2293
02:20:11.450 --> 02:20:14.690
89% that's criminal.
Okay.
Guess what?

2294
02:20:14.840 --> 02:20:16.580
55% were black.

2295
02:20:17.390 --> 02:20:22.270
32% that and yeah.
10% know when the whitening,

2296
02:20:22.700 --> 02:20:26.300
no teeth.
You know what happens?
Yeah.
Added is looking multiple.
It happen.
No,

2297
02:20:26.301 --> 02:20:29.860
it makes me happy about this.
No Jews,
no Jews.
Jews are white paper.

2298
02:20:29.930 --> 02:20:33.320
They have Jews in the white category now they put it now it would be June.

2299
02:20:33.321 --> 02:20:37.400
Where do you fall into it?
To you?
I'd say maybe,
maybe Latin.

2300
02:20:37.580 --> 02:20:42.290
If you start talking Spanish,
if I ran into as a see puppy,
when someone,

2301
02:20:42.291 --> 02:20:45.680
people trash white people,
I don't give a fuck if Detroit Jewish,
I get upset.

2302
02:20:45.681 --> 02:20:46.970
But white people or Jews,

2303
02:20:47.120 --> 02:20:49.730
Jews are white people but not with no wasp or white people.

2304
02:20:49.780 --> 02:20:51.720
And it was right after,
you know it's,

2305
02:20:51.721 --> 02:20:54.560
it's weird cause you look at 2012 how big it is.

2306
02:20:54.561 --> 02:20:57.530
And then look how in 2014 the big drop.

2307
02:20:57.531 --> 02:21:01.070
What was it that stopped it?
They got it.
They got in trouble.

2308
02:21:01.071 --> 02:21:04.130
It was 2000 they sued the fuck.
Wait a second.
Whoa,
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.

2309
02:21:04.160 --> 02:21:06.170
A lot of lawful.
Cause he'd say,

2310
02:21:06.470 --> 02:21:09.840
look at 8% in 2011 the kiss,
what gets you up?

2311
02:21:09.841 --> 02:21:14.540
You're not saying you stole.
Almost all of it is 80 plus percent innocent.

2312
02:21:14.541 --> 02:21:17.750
But guess what?
In these statistics and these statistics,

2313
02:21:17.930 --> 02:21:22.490
they're not saying whether a crime has risen or dropped since.
Fuck.

2314
02:21:23.960 --> 02:21:27.560
You can't just,
you can't just ruin people's lives.
You can't just arrest people,

2315
02:21:27.561 --> 02:21:29.780
Frisk him,
fuck with them,
give them all this crazy stress.

2316
02:21:29.900 --> 02:21:33.770
If they're totally innocent in 2006 it was 90% innocent.

2317
02:21:34.220 --> 02:21:39.110
It's ridiculous.
It's a stupid policy.
This start right after nine 11 no.

2318
02:21:39.680 --> 02:21:43.280
Well it started after nine 11 but they're deep into 2012 and they were doing it

2319
02:21:43.750 --> 02:21:47.450
when it first started.
Yeah,
2000 to 86% were totally us.

2320
02:21:47.630 --> 02:21:51.130
I always may you actually time when this started in 2012 who was mayor?

2321
02:21:51.131 --> 02:21:53.990
Was it Giuliani?
Well,
he was,
yeah,
he was the head.

2322
02:21:54.020 --> 02:21:58.400
He was the head district attorney.
This guy was,
he was a sucker.

2323
02:21:59.690 --> 02:22:02.600
Nine out of 10 stop and Frisk in New York.
Has it been completely innocent?

2324
02:22:03.020 --> 02:22:07.590
That's not good.
And it makes you wonder like,
like what is that one?
Oh,

2325
02:22:07.620 --> 02:22:10.670
he had some weed on them or you know,
they had like an ax.

2326
02:22:11.420 --> 02:22:14.180
It's all okay.
Yeah,
injustice.

2327
02:22:14.200 --> 02:22:16.810
There's fucking injustice throughout this world.

2328
02:22:16.811 --> 02:22:20.210
There's injustice amongst blacks.

2329
02:22:20.300 --> 02:22:23.540
White Jews brought women,

2330
02:22:23.541 --> 02:22:27.150
but obviously way more blacks than whites.
And if you know the numbers,

2331
02:22:27.270 --> 02:22:29.580
there's way more white people than black people in New York.

2332
02:22:29.670 --> 02:22:34.660
There's 13 profiling.
There's countries.
That's an illegal policy.
I mean that,

2333
02:22:34.661 --> 02:22:38.970
that if you might be legal,
but it's an immoral,
unjust,
unethical,

2334
02:22:38.971 --> 02:22:43.650
racist policy.
Should there be racial profile and towards Middle Easterns?
No.

2335
02:22:43.980 --> 02:22:48.180
You don't think so?
No at all.
No.
No.
Racial profiling.
You look,

2336
02:22:48.360 --> 02:22:50.520
if you know something about someone's past,

2337
02:22:50.640 --> 02:22:52.410
too many fucking people are in the Middle East.

2338
02:22:52.560 --> 02:22:54.750
The only people that are in the Middle East that aren't terrorists,

2339
02:22:55.080 --> 02:22:56.280
the vast majority.

2340
02:22:56.550 --> 02:22:59.820
So you're saying like because a small percentage are terrorists,

2341
02:22:59.970 --> 02:23:04.290
you should racially profile the vast majority of innocent people and subject

2342
02:23:04.291 --> 02:23:08.560
them to all sorts of scrutiny.
White people at the airport.
Why?

2343
02:23:08.570 --> 02:23:13.570
Why is it the airport when I know is going to pick fucking ass car racing?

2344
02:23:14.721 --> 02:23:15.554
I shit.
You know,

2345
02:23:16.040 --> 02:23:19.730
it seems like there's a lot more people to be killed that larger areas and it's

2346
02:23:19.760 --> 02:23:22.830
something about airplanes.
They're terrifying already.

2347
02:23:23.070 --> 02:23:25.800
So terror and airplanes just ramps it up even further.

2348
02:23:26.160 --> 02:23:29.850
We have the smartest people in the world that are supposedly running these

2349
02:23:29.851 --> 02:23:33.600
countries.
These airlines.
Do you know history,

2350
02:23:34.110 --> 02:23:37.110
how different issue would be with a fucking,

2351
02:23:37.230 --> 02:23:42.210
if Joe is a $5 dead bolt on that fucking cockpit door.

2352
02:23:42.570 --> 02:23:44.970
Okay.
To show deadbolt.
Okay.

2353
02:23:45.120 --> 02:23:48.960
How after all the hijackings to Cuba,

2354
02:23:49.010 --> 02:23:51.240
how much would that Guy Marshall's on planes?

2355
02:23:51.560 --> 02:23:55.350
If there was sky Marshall's on planes before nine 11 nine 11 would've never

2356
02:23:55.351 --> 02:23:58.500
happened.
Don't they would've just taken those fucking guys out.

2357
02:23:58.501 --> 02:24:00.930
Pack Doc tech note a bit of rap.
That'd been the end of it.

2358
02:24:00.931 --> 02:24:03.630
You have highly trained cops,
you know a mercenaries.

2359
02:24:03.631 --> 02:24:06.960
You'd get some black water guys where the fuck you gotta do guys who've been to

2360
02:24:06.961 --> 02:24:10.950
war?
No how to kill people and you put them on these planes to guard them from

2361
02:24:10.951 --> 02:24:14.490
assholes with box cutters and you're done.
I mean you just,
you,

2362
02:24:14.510 --> 02:24:15.690
you cost a little money.

2363
02:24:15.691 --> 02:24:20.691
And the idea that there were unprotected from something like that and the idea

2364
02:24:20.761 --> 02:24:24.120
that you could use a plane as a weapon and that had been considered long before

2365
02:24:24.121 --> 02:24:27.630
September 11th I mean they had talked about that many,
many times.

2366
02:24:27.631 --> 02:24:30.540
But what would happen if terrorists took,
hold me.
That was,

2367
02:24:30.690 --> 02:24:34.880
that was not a like a like an unthought of scenario.
So how,
give me,

2368
02:24:34.881 --> 02:24:39.881
none of these fucking CEO's are hedging these airlines said we fucking locked

2369
02:24:41.430 --> 02:24:45.410
pilots in.
We save money.
They don't open the door under any circle.

2370
02:24:45.411 --> 02:24:49.500
How about that flat land guy in Germany,
the pilot went to take a shit.

2371
02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:54.540
The copilot who's depressed decides to fly the plane into a,
into a mountain,

2372
02:24:54.541 --> 02:24:57.330
a mountain.
They can't even get inside.
I mean,
that's insane.

2373
02:24:57.360 --> 02:24:59.070
They're pounding on the door and this,

2374
02:24:59.120 --> 02:25:02.940
this asshole just drops the plane right down into a mountain.
I mean,

2375
02:25:02.941 --> 02:25:04.500
how the fuck is that possible?

2376
02:25:04.540 --> 02:25:08.670
How is there no fail safe method to get inside that plant?
Or how was,

2377
02:25:08.730 --> 02:25:11.820
how do they not have a phone where they going to override where they can call

2378
02:25:11.821 --> 02:25:14.310
someone and who could override the controls?

2379
02:25:14.550 --> 02:25:18.150
It seems to me like there should be another way into that car and I wonder how

2380
02:25:18.151 --> 02:25:21.600
hard it is to break that fucking door down.
Yeah,
I mean I,

2381
02:25:21.830 --> 02:25:23.350
which it's probably like a vault.

2382
02:25:24.530 --> 02:25:27.940
<v 0>It's probably one of those big heavy metal doors and it seems pretty big.</v>

2383
02:25:27.941 --> 02:25:31.720
But I wonder,
I wonder how hard it is.
I wonder how hard it is to break down.

2384
02:25:31.721 --> 02:25:35.040
I wonder what's happening physically pass whole pilot just fluid into your
mouth.

2385
02:25:35.070 --> 02:25:37.660
Yeah,
it was totally,
totally intentional.
He was depressed.

2386
02:25:37.870 --> 02:25:41.340
He was on anti depressants who suicidal.
He was,
he was all,
it was,

2387
02:25:41.350 --> 02:25:44.740
he was all fucked up.
I mean,
suicide is selfish.
Should be good.
I mean,

2388
02:25:44.741 --> 02:25:46.840
I can't deal with it.
I don't know.
I don't know anybody.

2389
02:25:47.270 --> 02:25:50.220
But to take a whole fucking plane cut off the bat.

2390
02:25:50.250 --> 02:25:55.150
Bucking emotions motherfucking.
Yeah.
And again,
you know,
we've focused on that.

2391
02:25:55.190 --> 02:25:56.023
Meanwhile this,

2392
02:25:56.140 --> 02:26:00.190
how many thousands of planes fly successfully every day and we don't even think

2393
02:26:00.191 --> 02:26:03.520
about not one parachute on the plane though.
Well,

2394
02:26:04.880 --> 02:26:08.830
you would die anyway,
man.
30 30,000 feet.

2395
02:26:08.890 --> 02:26:10.990
You wouldn't have any air when you jumped out.

2396
02:26:10.991 --> 02:26:15.250
You probably would die of having no air.
And on top of that,
it'd be freezing.

2397
02:26:15.251 --> 02:26:17.450
Fucking cold.
The,
the,

2398
02:26:17.530 --> 02:26:21.310
the idea that you would be fine and you would make it like when you parachute,

2399
02:26:21.311 --> 02:26:24.610
you don't really parachute from that high.
It's very prayers moving.

2400
02:26:24.611 --> 02:26:28.800
When they dance they do.
They have like all sorts of special equipment,

2401
02:26:29.170 --> 02:26:33.520
oxygen tanks and shit.
Here's uh,
uh,

2402
02:26:33.580 --> 02:26:36.130
it was on,
I don't know,
60 minutes or something and I didn't see it.

2403
02:26:36.131 --> 02:26:38.320
Bonnie told me,
and it makes sense,

2404
02:26:39.400 --> 02:26:43.600
if you went on a plane wearing a helmet or brought a helmet on,

2405
02:26:43.930 --> 02:26:48.930
your chances of survival are a lot better because most people when a plane

2406
02:26:49.931 --> 02:26:53.110
crashes,
hit,
hit their head on the fucking seat or whatever.

2407
02:26:53.560 --> 02:26:56.260
They get knocked out unconscious and they burned to death.

2408
02:26:56.590 --> 02:27:00.160
So if you got to fucking helmet,
boom,
you hit your head to credit,

2409
02:27:00.161 --> 02:27:02.500
probably going out.
Anyway,
I got news for you.

2410
02:27:02.900 --> 02:27:05.900
I mean you could helmet going 500 miles an hour.
You're,

2411
02:27:05.950 --> 02:27:08.560
your fucking head is Jello.
Even that side of the hill,

2412
02:27:08.940 --> 02:27:11.950
when they catch guys who die in motorcycle accidents,

2413
02:27:11.951 --> 02:27:15.700
they called them squids because there they have helmets on,

2414
02:27:15.701 --> 02:27:18.840
but their neck gets snapped anyway.
And so they're like a squid.

2415
02:27:18.841 --> 02:27:23.841
The everything below the hard stuff is just mush or how come I'm waiting for the

2416
02:27:24.431 --> 02:27:28.570
airplane?
Oh man,
that really fucking defeated my fucking theory.

2417
02:27:28.571 --> 02:27:29.920
Cause every time I go on to play now,

2418
02:27:29.921 --> 02:27:34.810
I tried to get a blanket in case you're just going to crash.
I like a turban.

2419
02:27:34.950 --> 02:27:37.300
We gotta wrap this up.
I gotta get Outta here unfortunately.

2420
02:27:37.450 --> 02:27:41.200
How can they really don't make God damned when I'm a hunter?
Just float.

2421
02:27:41.380 --> 02:27:44.260
How come on.
I don't know.
I bring it to another level.

2422
02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:49.160
I don't know if Tom and Christine does what Bonnie and I do.
Find out the rose,

2423
02:27:50.070 --> 02:27:53.520
the rose.
Rose Rose bad.

2424
02:27:53.560 --> 02:27:57.480
Will you guys be willing to fly in for this?
Yeah,
probably.
We want to,

2425
02:27:58.350 --> 02:28:01.420
you want to do a week of vacation in here anyhow.
Okay.

2426
02:28:01.570 --> 02:28:02.650
Well tell me when you're doing it.

2427
02:28:02.800 --> 02:28:06.520
I'll have you guys both in studio together and uh,
we'll,
we'll promote it.
Yeah,

2428
02:28:06.521 --> 02:28:09.310
but we got to do in a club,
you mean,
right?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
No,

2429
02:28:09.311 --> 02:28:13.630
I'm saying you and Bonnie have you guys in studio to promote it and maybe I'll

2430
02:28:13.631 --> 02:28:17.910
have Tom and Christina and studios on a different day or maybe in the same fun

2431
02:28:18.220 --> 02:28:22.010
chaos.
Yeah,
it sounds fucking total chaos.
Yeah.
We'll do it.

2432
02:28:22.790 --> 02:28:27.210
<v 3>Or we got to end this weekend.
Best Ventura County Club.</v>

2433
02:28:27.220 --> 02:28:31.070
Thank you for having me.
Fucking if go see him this weekend,

2434
02:28:31.071 --> 02:28:33.110

If you don't have a good time,

2435
02:28:33.111 --> 02:28:35.060
you're a shithead and you have a terrible sense of humor.

2436
02:28:35.360 --> 02:28:39.350
Rich Vos would be at the venter a comedy club Friday,
Saturday,
and Sunday.

2437
02:28:39.351 --> 02:28:44.120
Ventura Harbor Comedy Club.
Google it.
You can find it.
Rich Vos on Twitter.

2438
02:28:44.480 --> 02:28:46.160
I love you,
buddy.
Thanks for,
I have it.
All right.
