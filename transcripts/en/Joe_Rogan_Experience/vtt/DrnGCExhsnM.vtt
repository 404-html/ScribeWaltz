7
00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:19.330
<v Speaker 1>the pineal gland out of a small child </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then implanted in me.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Pretty much judging.</v>

20
00:00:39.931 --> 00:00:40.740
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to.</v>

21

<v Speaker 1>Trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

22
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.100
<v Speaker 1>but you could see that in you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you look different.</v>

23
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.130
<v Speaker 1>You really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look like when I was on here last </v>

24
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.950
<v Speaker 1>time I was at the end of a pretty big </v>
<v Speaker 1>travel cycle,</v>

25
00:00:49.951 --> 00:00:54.951
<v Speaker 1>like doing military gigs and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and that was pretty beat down and </v>

26
00:00:54.951 --> 00:00:58.250
<v Speaker 1>we've had two kids since,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I was on the podcast and older </v>

27
00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.400
<v Speaker 1>that has beat me down to beat me down in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different way.</v>

28
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.380
<v Speaker 1>So I've just been at home and I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>train,</v>

29
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.510
<v Speaker 1>don't travel as much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so yeah,</v>

30
00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:08.511
<v Speaker 1>everything's been pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do this gymnastics bodies programming </v>

31
00:01:08.511 --> 00:01:09.000
<v Speaker 1>couple of days a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of squatting,</v>

32
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:14.001
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of dead lifting pretty on </v>
<v Speaker 1>point with food and then just getting </v>

33
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:15.360
<v Speaker 1>the dog Piss beat out of me at jets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like two to four days a week.</v>

34
00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:16.430
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

35
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.430
<v Speaker 1>What got you into that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man,</v>

36
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.530
<v Speaker 1>I've always been interested in martial </v>
<v Speaker 1>arts.</v>

37
00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:26.910
<v Speaker 1>Like as a kid I had a brown belt and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Ed Parker Kenpo system.</v>

38
00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Old School.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

39
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.020
<v Speaker 1>Old Old School Elvis Presley style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

40
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.310
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

41
00:01:32.311 --> 00:01:37.311
<v Speaker 1>like I knew that Parker had some </v>
<v Speaker 1>connections with like Bruce Lee in jkd </v>

42
00:01:37.311 --> 00:01:38.460
<v Speaker 1>and I was really always really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in that.</v>

43
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.910
<v Speaker 1>So I went down to Long Beach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>California and ended up tracking down </v>

44
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.941
<v Speaker 1>some folks at the Inosanto Academy and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sparred with a kid that had been </v>

45
00:01:46.941 --> 00:01:50.340
<v Speaker 1>doing tai boxing for like six months and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was 60 pounds lighter than I was,</v>

46
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:51.930
<v Speaker 1>not particularly athletic.</v>

47
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.930
<v Speaker 1>And he beat the crap out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was just like a man fighting a</v>

48
00:01:57.451 --> 00:02:02.451
<v Speaker 1>boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only I was bigger and stronger and </v>

49
00:02:02.451 --> 00:02:04.071
<v Speaker 1>faster and he just destroyed me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went back home and I burned my </v>

50
00:02:04.071 --> 00:02:08.451
<v Speaker 1>brown belt and I started studying some </v>
<v Speaker 1>Thai boxing and it wasn't long after </v>

51
00:02:08.451 --> 00:02:11.961
<v Speaker 1>this that I encountered Brazilian </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu for the first time and I had a </v>

52
00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:14.190
<v Speaker 1>little bit of a high school wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 1>background and I was a state county,</v>

53
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.140
<v Speaker 1>the California state power lifting </v>
<v Speaker 1>champion.</v>

54
00:02:16.141 --> 00:02:18.960
<v Speaker 1>So strong athletic kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

55
00:02:18.961 --> 00:02:22.860
<v Speaker 1>like this guy like submitted me 50 times</v>
<v Speaker 1>in like two minutes.</v>

56
00:02:22.861 --> 00:02:27.120
<v Speaker 1>And I was just kinda blown away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this was back in like [inaudible] 92</v>

57
00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:32.121
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you were in a major metropolitan </v>

58
00:02:32.121 --> 00:02:32.121
<v Speaker 1>area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just couldn't find Jujitsu,</v>

59
00:02:32.121 --> 00:02:34.260
<v Speaker 1>so I did a couple of weeks of it then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:02:34.261 --> 00:02:39.261
<v Speaker 1>around like 92 93 and I didn't have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>second Jujitsu session until like 2003 </v>

61
00:02:39.661 --> 00:02:44.661
<v Speaker 1>and again it was like a month or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something because at that point the </v>

62
00:02:44.661 --> 00:02:45.420
<v Speaker 1>folks that we're usually running these </v>
<v Speaker 1>schools,</v>

63
00:02:45.421 --> 00:02:48.270
<v Speaker 1>like they could barely keep 'em open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like 9:00</v>

64
00:02:48.271 --> 00:02:50.370
<v Speaker 1>in the back of a karate school or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

65
00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:55.371
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's only been the past couple of </v>

66
00:02:55.371 --> 00:02:55.371
<v Speaker 1>years that I've been able to be pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>consistent.</v>

67
00:02:55.371 --> 00:02:57.090
<v Speaker 1>So you just found a great gym out where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were at?</v>

68
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

69
00:02:57.661 --> 00:02:59.260
<v Speaker 1>I've kind of bounced around a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

70
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Kelly farrel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conviction,</v>

71
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:05.851
<v Speaker 1>martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then also the gorilla Jujitsu </v>

72
00:03:05.851 --> 00:03:08.520
<v Speaker 1>affiliate there in Reno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I get out to Elko to the guys </v>

73
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.520
<v Speaker 1>that a straight blast gym in Elko under </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Meyer.</v>

74
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.770
<v Speaker 2>So you out in the Reno area?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

75
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what Rena was like.</v>

76
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.630
<v Speaker 2>I went to Reno this past August and </v>
<v Speaker 2>went,</v>

77
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.240
<v Speaker 2>I've maybe had passed through once when </v>
<v Speaker 2>I was younger,</v>

78
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 2>but we went through reno into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mountains in Nevada.</v>

79
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.650
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking beautiful.</v>

80
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.830
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

81
00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.210
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's four seasons.</v>

82
00:03:29.211 --> 00:03:31.970
<v Speaker 1>Like the summer's great winter was </v>
<v Speaker 1>really cool this year.</v>

83
00:03:31.971 --> 00:03:33.320
<v Speaker 1>Good snowboarding and all that.</v>

84
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.630
<v Speaker 2>So it looks like a Colorado up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

85
00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.710
<v Speaker 2>do you think Nevada you think desert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think barren landscape?</v>

86
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.440
<v Speaker 2>Not Very pretty or pretty in those sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a like,</v>

87
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.750
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you better bring water sort of a way.</v>

88
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.450
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was gorgeous.</v>

89
00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

90
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:48.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

91
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.480
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of funny when people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

92
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.920
<v Speaker 1>like if I'm being interviewed or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something too,</v>

93
00:03:52.921 --> 00:03:57.921
<v Speaker 1>like you live in Reno really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that part of a parole violation or </v>

94
00:03:57.921 --> 00:04:00.801
<v Speaker 1>something that I really liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing that is sad though is the </v>

95
00:04:00.801 --> 00:04:02.580
<v Speaker 1>casinos in Reno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're weird.</v>

96
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.280
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really weird mix because you have</v>

97
00:04:05.281 --> 00:04:10.281
<v Speaker 1>like Tesla and all these tech companies </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have moved into town and it's </v>

98
00:04:10.281 --> 00:04:10.920
<v Speaker 1>really got this new vibe going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

99
00:04:10.921 --> 00:04:14.880
<v Speaker 1>like the big tesla mega plant is out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there kind of east of town,</v>

100
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.100
<v Speaker 1>so you've got this kind of technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>scene,</v>

101
00:04:17.101 --> 00:04:22.101
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole startup row in downtown </v>
<v Speaker 1>Reno and then you have the casinos and </v>

102
00:04:22.101 --> 00:04:26.901
<v Speaker 1>that whole underbelly element to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so these two things are like </v>

103
00:04:26.901 --> 00:04:26.901
<v Speaker 1>literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

104
00:04:26.901 --> 00:04:31.221
<v Speaker 1>you change corners downtown and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>in either the lake super depressing,</v>

105
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like failed at the casino deal or you go</v>

106
00:04:36.001 --> 00:04:38.940
<v Speaker 1>around the corner and there's a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys with the technology startups,</v>

107
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.180
<v Speaker 1>technology startups will overwhelm the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty casinos.</v>

108
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.700
<v Speaker 1>I still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

109
00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:47.370
<v Speaker 1>like tech in general and this is maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting off in the weeds,</v>

110
00:04:47.371 --> 00:04:52.371
<v Speaker 1>but there's so much stuff that's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>been built on speculation and eyeballs </v>

111
00:04:52.371 --> 00:04:56.481
<v Speaker 1>and nothing real that I'm still curious </v>
<v Speaker 1>if like tech in general is going to make</v>

112
00:04:56.491 --> 00:04:57.990
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

113
00:04:57.991 --> 00:05:00.600
<v Speaker 1>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how so in what way do you know,</v>

114
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was so much speculative money that</v>

115
00:05:03.571 --> 00:05:05.130
<v Speaker 1>went into that scene and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

116
00:05:05.131 --> 00:05:10.131
<v Speaker 1>there's only a few entities like </v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook and Google and stuff that have </v>

117
00:05:10.131 --> 00:05:10.560
<v Speaker 1>really turned it into a money making </v>
<v Speaker 1>venture.</v>

118
00:05:10.561 --> 00:05:15.561
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of these technology startups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of money going into </v>

119
00:05:15.561 --> 00:05:20.061
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was just kind of predicated on </v>

120
00:05:20.061 --> 00:05:22.310
<v Speaker 1>growth or eyeballs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they never really had a strategy </v>

121
00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.801
<v Speaker 1>towards profitability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm just kinda curious how many </v>

122
00:05:24.801 --> 00:05:25.560
<v Speaker 1>of these things are really gonna gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>make the cut.</v>

123
00:05:25.561 --> 00:05:28.020
<v Speaker 1>But it could be really good to like if </v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

124
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.470
<v Speaker 1>if that stuff tightens up and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>really start looking at it like a </v>

125
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.220
<v Speaker 1>legitimate business and not just </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyeballs and bandwidth.</v>

126
00:05:35.221 --> 00:05:36.990
<v Speaker 1>So it'll be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

127
00:05:36.991 --> 00:05:38.730
<v Speaker 1>I've always thought that was weird about</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>

128
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.690
<v Speaker 1>The twitter</v>

129
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.430
<v Speaker 2>has so many users and has so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much activity,</v>

130
00:05:44.431 --> 00:05:45.900
<v Speaker 2>there's something going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

131
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.540
<v Speaker 2>But then they have to figure out how do </v>
<v Speaker 2>you generate money from that.</v>

132
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.560
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

133
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's worth a lot of money,</v>

134
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.300
<v Speaker 2>but for no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

135
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.620
<v Speaker 2>It's like God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's using it.</v>

136
00:05:55.621 --> 00:05:58.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what do you do with it right</v>

137
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.100
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I feel like someone's going to </v>

138
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.100
<v Speaker 1>figure it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I felt like that two years ago.</v>

139
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

140
00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They stay open.</v>

141
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.280
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

142
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

143
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.010
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

144
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:15.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep hearing that I'm on a shadow </v>

145
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:15.130
<v Speaker 1>banned list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You heard of that?</v>

146
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's horseshit.</v>

147
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.620
<v Speaker 1>We have Jordan Peterson on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that probably got you on some sort of</v>

148
00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:26.621
<v Speaker 1>a short latest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a bunch of people on Gavin </v>

149
00:06:26.621 --> 00:06:27.350
<v Speaker 1>McInnes is more egregious probably and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more ridiculous.</v>

150
00:06:27.351 --> 00:06:28.820
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steven Crowder,</v>

151
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.630
<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones is the biggest one for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

152
00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.360
<v Speaker 3>Did you see what the list like means </v>
<v Speaker 3>like what it means to be on that list?</v>

153
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:35.060
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not exactly.</v>

154
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.080
<v Speaker 3>Like you just get your tweets reviewed </v>
<v Speaker 3>by a person before they make it out to </v>

155
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.080
<v Speaker 3>your feet or something like that out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

156
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.800
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that real?</v>

157
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.640
<v Speaker 3>That's what it said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's real,</v>

158
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:43.360
<v Speaker 3>but that's what it said</v>

159
00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.310
<v Speaker 1>most of my tweets and make it out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the ones that don't.</v>

160
00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:52.340
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for cut those off because it </v>

161
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.580
<v Speaker 1>was some kind of oversight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hammered at the comedy store at 2:00</v>

162
00:06:53.581 --> 00:06:55.900
<v Speaker 1>in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to rile people up for no reason.</v>

163
00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.640
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you for protecting me from myself.</v>

164
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in any way advocating censorship</v>

165
00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:03.460
<v Speaker 1>and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

166
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm not necessarily sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it either.</v>

167
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:08.880
<v Speaker 1>Sorry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deviation of.</v>

168
00:07:08.881 --> 00:07:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>

169
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:15.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've been following your instagram </v>

170
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.061
<v Speaker 1>feed and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and your wife have been doing some </v>

171
00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:19.950
<v Speaker 1>crazy blood sugar tests after foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>postcard meals,</v>

172
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.320
<v Speaker 1>like beans and a bunch of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>different high carb foods.</v>

173
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:28.850
<v Speaker 1>What are you trying to do there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you on a Keto diet or what are you </v>

174
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:28.890
<v Speaker 1>doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I generally run really well.</v>

175
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Quito or pretty close to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fueling Jujitsu is a little rough </v>

176
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.761
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I maybe do about 75 to 100 grams of </v>

177
00:07:37.761 --> 00:07:40.701
<v Speaker 1>carbs on harder training days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then other days it's pretty low </v>

178
00:07:40.701 --> 00:07:43.581
<v Speaker 1>carb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My wife though is kind of like </v>

179
00:07:43.581 --> 00:07:43.581
<v Speaker 1>Wolverine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you just can't kill her.</v>

180
00:07:43.581 --> 00:07:47.220
<v Speaker 1>And this is some of the stuff that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned in the past couple of years,</v>

181
00:07:47.221 --> 00:07:52.221
<v Speaker 1>this personalized nutrition where </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a huge variation from person to </v>

182
00:07:52.221 --> 00:07:52.830
<v Speaker 1>person and how they respond to </v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates,</v>

183
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.380
<v Speaker 1>foods in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in particular carbohydrates.</v>

184
00:07:55.381 --> 00:08:00.381
<v Speaker 1>There was a study done at the Weizmann </v>
<v Speaker 1>Institute in Israel a couple of years </v>

185
00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:03.210
<v Speaker 1>ago and they basically put a continuous </v>
<v Speaker 1>glucometer on folks.</v>

186
00:08:03.211 --> 00:08:05.700
<v Speaker 1>It's a little disk that you pop on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>back of your arm.</v>

187
00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:09.180
<v Speaker 1>They did a full genetic screen on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a gut microbiome test,</v>

188
00:08:09.181 --> 00:08:14.181
<v Speaker 1>and then they started feeding these </v>
<v Speaker 1>folks different meals and the blood </v>

189
00:08:14.181 --> 00:08:14.340
<v Speaker 1>glucose responses were all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

190
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:19.340
<v Speaker 1>Like one person would eat rice and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have a barely perceptible blood </v>

191
00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.510
<v Speaker 1>glucose increase and another person </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be near diabetic from,</v>

192
00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:26.570
<v Speaker 1>from beating that Rice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do they believe this is a genetic </v>

193
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:29.451
<v Speaker 1>variability?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that location like where their </v>

194
00:08:29.451 --> 00:08:30.180
<v Speaker 1>genetic ancestors and gut microbiome </v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to drive it?</v>

195
00:08:30.181 --> 00:08:33.900
<v Speaker 1>And so if the gut is unhealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that seems to make your blood sugar</v>

196
00:08:33.901 --> 00:08:35.940
<v Speaker 1>response worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then conversely,</v>

197
00:08:35.941 --> 00:08:40.080
<v Speaker 1>if you eat in a way that makes your </v>
<v Speaker 1>blood glucose response look pretty good,</v>

198
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:45.470
<v Speaker 1>then the gut microbiome seems to shift </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards what they consider to be a </v>

199
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:45.470
<v Speaker 1>healthier profile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>

200
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:50.360
<v Speaker 1>So now is there anything you can do to </v>
<v Speaker 1>your Gut biome to change the glucose </v>

201
00:08:51.301 --> 00:08:53.640
<v Speaker 1>profile?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

202
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly what to do is pretty </v>

203
00:08:58.700 --> 00:08:58.700
<v Speaker 1>complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

204
00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:03.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people can have a condition called </v>

205
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.680
<v Speaker 1>small intestinal bacterial overgrowth </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the bacteria are basically growing</v>

206
00:09:04.681 --> 00:09:07.320
<v Speaker 1>too far north in the gut essentially.</v>

207
00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.080
<v Speaker 1>And then whenever you eat something with</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbs in it,</v>

208
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:15.140
<v Speaker 1>it makes those bacteria grow in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate place in inappropriate </v>

209
00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:19.431
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's Kinda difficult to basically </v>

210
00:09:19.431 --> 00:09:22.941
<v Speaker 1>starve the bacteria in the fore gut and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then feed the bacteria in the hind gut.</v>

211
00:09:23.431 --> 00:09:24.420
<v Speaker 1>And there are some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

212
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.220
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Kresser on like,</v>

213
00:09:26.221 --> 00:09:31.221
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the best people in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably in dealing with stuff like </v>

214
00:09:31.221 --> 00:09:31.221
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

215
00:09:31.221 --> 00:09:31.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

216
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.350
<v Speaker 1>I'll put it like this in the last five </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

217
00:09:34.351 --> 00:09:39.351
<v Speaker 1>we've learned more about the gut </v>
<v Speaker 1>microbiome than we knew in the previous </v>

218
00:09:39.351 --> 00:09:40.380
<v Speaker 1>50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like literally every month that goes</v>

219
00:09:40.381 --> 00:09:45.381
<v Speaker 1>by we will learn more and more and more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the clinical application of doing </v>

220
00:09:45.381 --> 00:09:47.700
<v Speaker 1>something to help somebody that's sick </v>
<v Speaker 1>is not easy.</v>

221
00:09:47.701 --> 00:09:52.350
<v Speaker 1>It's a pretty complex process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people will experience a lot of</v>

222
00:09:52.351 --> 00:09:54.690
<v Speaker 1>improvement from just kind of a low carb</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet,</v>

223
00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:56.340
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't work for everybody.</v>

224
00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:01.340
<v Speaker 1>Like they may a lot of people may need </v>
<v Speaker 1>like some herbal interventions like a </v>

225
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:06.210
<v Speaker 1>garlic in and different antimicrobial </v>
<v Speaker 1>agents that help to knock that bacterial</v>

226
00:10:06.211 --> 00:10:08.010
<v Speaker 1>overgrowth back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a,</v>

227
00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:13.340
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty challenging process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Particularly if the person is really </v>

228
00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:13.590
<v Speaker 1>sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does fasting have any effect on it?</v>

229
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:18.770
<v Speaker 1>It can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can just like reduced meal frequency </v>

230
00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:20.430
<v Speaker 1>seems to improve the gut microbiome and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the overall gut health.</v>

231
00:10:20.431 --> 00:10:25.431
<v Speaker 1>So this is some of the stuff that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think is going on with intermittent </v>

232
00:10:25.431 --> 00:10:28.380
<v Speaker 1>fasting where instead of eating like six</v>
<v Speaker 1>or seven meals a day and just constantly</v>

233
00:10:28.381 --> 00:10:32.910
<v Speaker 1>kind of keeping the gut inflamed instead</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing maybe one or two meals a day.</v>

234
00:10:32.911 --> 00:10:36.570
<v Speaker 1>Pretty broad spacing seems to have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>great benefits for folks.</v>

235
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:40.380
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing that thing where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>only eat for 10 hours a day.</v>

236
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:41.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

237
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:43.410
<v Speaker 1>I did a podcast with Dr Rhonda Patrick.</v>

238
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:48.560
<v Speaker 1>She was explaining it to me and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me give it a try and I've had some </v>

239
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.651
<v Speaker 1>really great results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lost a lot of body fat almost </v>

240
00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:51.651
<v Speaker 1>immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started losing body fat from it,</v>

241
00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:55.080
<v Speaker 1>but didn't lose any energy and don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel great.</v>

242
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:55.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

243
00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.770
<v Speaker 1>everything feels really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

244
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:02.900
<v Speaker 1>it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's challenging because I would come </v>

245
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:02.900
<v Speaker 1>home from shows like late at night and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be hungry.</v>

246
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.290
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm supposed to be drinking water,</v>

247
00:11:04.291 --> 00:11:04.550
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

248
00:11:04.551 --> 00:11:07.080
<v Speaker 1>he was supposed to have anything that </v>
<v Speaker 1>your body has to metabolize,</v>

249
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:07.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

250
00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:12.240
<v Speaker 1>Even coffee will kind of cause a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit of a adrenal response.</v>

251
00:11:12.241 --> 00:11:15.390
<v Speaker 1>The liver kicks out some glucose and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then it basically presses the reset.</v>

252
00:11:15.391 --> 00:11:20.391
<v Speaker 1>But what about herbal tea?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think that that would probably </v>

253
00:11:20.391 --> 00:11:20.391
<v Speaker 1>be okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

254
00:11:20.391 --> 00:11:21.300
<v Speaker 1>the folks that really know a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

255
00:11:21.301 --> 00:11:23.460
<v Speaker 1>like Rhonda Patrick Valter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Longo,</v>

256
00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:26.550
<v Speaker 1>they're really pretty adamant that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that fasting period,</v>

257
00:11:26.551 --> 00:11:28.320
<v Speaker 1>like just wanting nothing but water.</v>

258
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

259
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:34.370
<v Speaker 1>Water is delicious when you thirsty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not so good for the rest of the </v>

260
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:34.380
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

261
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.460
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's boring ass.</v>

262
00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:40.461
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I grabbed one of these guys </v>

263
00:11:40.461 --> 00:11:40.461
<v Speaker 1>are real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is.</v>

264
00:11:40.461 --> 00:11:43.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Via for people don't know is not a </v>

265
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.031
<v Speaker 1>sponsor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just we drink it and it's Stevia </v>

266
00:11:46.031 --> 00:11:46.920
<v Speaker 1>flavored soda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's really like a guilt free soda.</v>

267
00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.270
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is crazy.</v>

268
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Like soda that's sweetened with plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

269
00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:54.460
<v Speaker 1>And not sweetened in a way that affects </v>
<v Speaker 1>your blood glucose level at all.</v>

270
00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:59.680
<v Speaker 1>Stevia can reduce blood glucose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in some people,</v>

271
00:11:59.681 --> 00:12:04.681
<v Speaker 1>because the sweet taste,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they actually release insulin in </v>

272
00:12:04.681 --> 00:12:08.301
<v Speaker 1>response to Israeli.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you grab a couple of those gems and </v>

273
00:12:08.301 --> 00:12:10.921
<v Speaker 1>then bit thirsty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the downside is that if you have </v>

274
00:12:10.921 --> 00:12:14.311
<v Speaker 1>somebody that has kind of an insulin </v>
<v Speaker 1>roller coaster can actually make that </v>

275
00:12:14.311 --> 00:12:15.550
<v Speaker 1>problem worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Stevie is super good.</v>

276
00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.980
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a lot better than most </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial sweeteners,</v>

277
00:12:17.981 --> 00:12:21.790
<v Speaker 1>but there are folks that can kind of get</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves into a bad spot with it.</v>

278
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:23.620
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not know.</v>

279
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:25.390
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is it?</v>

280
00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:28.900
<v Speaker 1>Is there like a recommended daily </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowance of Stevia?</v>

281
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.710
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

282
00:12:29.711 --> 00:12:32.200
<v Speaker 1>this is just a really individualistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

283
00:12:32.201 --> 00:12:34.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's something that like if somebody</v>

284
00:12:34.661 --> 00:12:39.661
<v Speaker 1>is a health coach or a doctor or </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare provider and they see </v>

285
00:12:39.661 --> 00:12:40.690
<v Speaker 1>somebody that's struggling with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and then they're like,</v>

286
00:12:40.691 --> 00:12:41.710
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how are you eating?</v>

287
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm eating low carb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

288
00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:45.250
<v Speaker 1>So are you doing any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

289
00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:49.870
<v Speaker 1>artificial sweeteners or what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if they're doing something like this</v>

290
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:53.740
<v Speaker 1>then it could be something that is kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of kicking them out of the,</v>

291
00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:54.970
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

292
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.030
<v Speaker 1>the insulin regulation that would work </v>
<v Speaker 1>better for them.</v>

293
00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what do you think about colonics </v>

294
00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:04.400
<v Speaker 1>related?</v>

295
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:05.290
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

296
00:13:05.291 --> 00:13:09.080
<v Speaker 1>but because I feel like it was a thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>for awhile.</v>

297
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:14.430
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>cleaning out their intestinal tract and </v>

298
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:17.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just got to get water up there and </v>

299
00:13:17.221 --> 00:13:19.311
<v Speaker 1>flush everything out and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people would like literally watch the </v>

300
00:13:19.311 --> 00:13:19.510
<v Speaker 1>tube and go low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're eating.</v>

301
00:13:19.511 --> 00:13:20.380
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

302
00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:26.880
<v Speaker 1>It always seemed odd to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems like there's generally an </v>

303
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.620
<v Speaker 1>exit only kind of process and so yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

304
00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:34.680
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're trying to do certain </v>

305
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:34.680
<v Speaker 1>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

306
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.500
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certain drugs apparently are best when </v>

307
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.500
<v Speaker 1>you stick them up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a girl named neuro soup,</v>

308
00:13:38.501 --> 00:13:39.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if she's on youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>

309
00:13:39.761 --> 00:13:44.761
<v Speaker 1>but she had this whole detailed story </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a dmt trip that she did was she </v>

310
00:13:45.251 --> 00:13:50.251
<v Speaker 1>took dmt upper butt and went on like </v>
<v Speaker 1>some five hour journey into the </v>

311
00:13:50.681 --> 00:13:53.830
<v Speaker 1>Netherworld because it goes directly </v>
<v Speaker 1>into your bloodstream from there,</v>

312
00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:54.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

313
00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:55.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that base.</v>

314
00:13:55.211 --> 00:13:59.920
<v Speaker 1>And so you've got a [inaudible] deal to </v>
<v Speaker 1>like with your hand that base kind of an</v>

315
00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:02.830
<v Speaker 1>asshole or talking about you making that</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand signal.</v>

316
00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.350
<v Speaker 1>But I always wondered if it was good for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

317
00:14:05.351 --> 00:14:10.351
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like you should leave that </v>

318
00:14:10.351 --> 00:14:12.320
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like flooding water up there just </v>

319
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:12.320
<v Speaker 1>doesn't seem like the smartest move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

320
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.550
<v Speaker 1>it seems like just skipping a meal here </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there and just kind of letting it do</v>

321
00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.490
<v Speaker 1>its natural business seems like a pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>good thing.</v>

322
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:20.950
<v Speaker 1>The people that I encountered that did </v>
<v Speaker 1>clonics,</v>

323
00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:23.350
<v Speaker 1>they seem to be on kind of a merry go </v>
<v Speaker 1>round with it.</v>

324
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.080
<v Speaker 1>And they also were into some other </v>
<v Speaker 1>really squirrely,</v>

325
00:14:26.081 --> 00:14:27.440
<v Speaker 1>stopped like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

326
00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:32.350
<v Speaker 1>like healing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healing and shock rose in it.</v>

327
00:14:32.351 --> 00:14:37.351
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just seemed like they were always </v>

328
00:14:37.351 --> 00:14:40.951
<v Speaker 1>moving towards something and never </v>
<v Speaker 1>really getting there and so it just </v>

329
00:14:40.951 --> 00:14:45.331
<v Speaker 1>seemed odd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there was never like a resolution </v>

330
00:14:45.331 --> 00:14:47.761
<v Speaker 1>to the situation and I kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>having some endpoints and then move on </v>

331
00:14:47.761 --> 00:14:48.060
<v Speaker 1>and do something else.</v>

332
00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:52.270
<v Speaker 1>I always get very curious of something </v>
<v Speaker 1>or very sort of,</v>

333
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:56.120
<v Speaker 1>I guess skeptical is the right word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but have something that doesn't have any</v>

334
00:14:56.150 --> 00:15:01.150
<v Speaker 1>research behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I wanted to know like how </v>

335
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.190
<v Speaker 1>much research is there behind Kalanick </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't,</v>

336
00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.760
<v Speaker 1>I never hear about any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never dug into it.</v>

337
00:15:04.761 --> 00:15:09.761
<v Speaker 1>So I honestly don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do know that there have been some </v>

338
00:15:09.761 --> 00:15:11.390
<v Speaker 1>studies looking at the gut microbiome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when they do a,</v>

339
00:15:11.391 --> 00:15:12.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a colonoscopy,</v>

340
00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.080
<v Speaker 1>so they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll kind of flush it out and they'll</v>

341
00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:17.060
<v Speaker 1>give you some stuff to move everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

342
00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:22.600
<v Speaker 1>And there is some research that suggests</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not great for the gut micro or </v>

343
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.650
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lower gut microbiome that there's </v>

344
00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:27.440
<v Speaker 1>actually some pathological changes from </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

345
00:15:27.441 --> 00:15:31.760
<v Speaker 1>So going in and getting a colonoscopy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of the like strafed bombing that</v>

346
00:15:31.761 --> 00:15:34.180
<v Speaker 1>they do to move everything out may not </v>
<v Speaker 1>be that great.</v>

347
00:15:34.181 --> 00:15:38.770
<v Speaker 1>It's a great way to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brave thinking about fighter plane.</v>

348
00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.070
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Agent Orange.</v>

349
00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:47.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I know that people that have </v>

350
00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:50.080
<v Speaker 1>antibiotics that like people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>battering battling staph infection have </v>

351
00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.430
<v Speaker 1>a horrendous time sort of reconstructing</v>
<v Speaker 1>their gut biome.</v>

352
00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:55.400
<v Speaker 1>And Rhonda Patrick detailed that on one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the podcasts that we did,</v>

353
00:15:55.401 --> 00:16:00.401
<v Speaker 1>she had a tremendous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a staph infection and it route it </v>

354
00:16:00.401 --> 00:16:05.070
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she actually wound up one of the </v>

355
00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:05.660
<v Speaker 1>things that really helped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a topical application of garlic.</v>

356
00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:06.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

357
00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:08.450
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is really interesting.</v>

358
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A garlic Oregano.</v>

359
00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:16.940
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of these traditional oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>Oregano oil and like the Oregano oil and</v>

360
00:16:16.941 --> 00:16:21.941
<v Speaker 1>the garlic are really potent in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kind of spare the healthy bacteria </v>

361
00:16:21.941 --> 00:16:22.910
<v Speaker 1>are what we would call the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>beneficial bacteria,</v>

362
00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:28.270
<v Speaker 1>but even that's not a universal story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it can suppress some of the more </v>

363
00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:30.230
<v Speaker 1>beneficial bacteria in some situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>

364
00:16:30.231 --> 00:16:33.650
<v Speaker 1>this is where if you think you've got </v>
<v Speaker 1>something going on,</v>

365
00:16:33.651 --> 00:16:38.651
<v Speaker 1>it's probably smart to work with </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody that knows a little bit about </v>

366
00:16:38.651 --> 00:16:39.020
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing so that you've got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>protocol,</v>

367
00:16:39.021 --> 00:16:40.820
<v Speaker 1>you can test it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see what the results are,</v>

368
00:16:40.821 --> 00:16:44.960
<v Speaker 1>and then we can make some decisions </v>
<v Speaker 1>based off that because you could really,</v>

369
00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:46.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're already in a compromised state</v>

370
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.650
<v Speaker 1>and then you throw something like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

371
00:16:48.651 --> 00:16:49.790
<v Speaker 1>you can end up worse.</v>

372
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for people that are listening,</v>

373
00:16:51.771 --> 00:16:56.771
<v Speaker 1>who would someone go to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say if you really wanted to get </v>

374
00:16:56.771 --> 00:16:57.710
<v Speaker 1>your gut biome checked out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

375
00:16:57.711 --> 00:16:59.940
<v Speaker 1>someone like Chris Kresser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

376
00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:03.080
<v Speaker 1>there's a gal in Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amy Myers,</v>

377
00:17:03.081 --> 00:17:07.670
<v Speaker 1>there's a Dr Ruscio up in the bay area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Kresser also has a,</v>

378
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:12.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Kresser Institute or re certifying </v>

379
00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:14.741
<v Speaker 1>healthcare practitioners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are the folks that you want to </v>

380
00:17:14.741 --> 00:17:14.741
<v Speaker 1>check out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

381
00:17:14.741 --> 00:17:16.520
<v Speaker 1>the Institute of Functional Medicine is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a really good place.</v>

382
00:17:16.521 --> 00:17:21.521
<v Speaker 1>Most of the doctors and healthcare </v>
<v Speaker 1>providers that go through that </v>

383
00:17:21.521 --> 00:17:23.180
<v Speaker 1>functional medicine training are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>well versed in looking at the,</v>

384
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:25.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole gut microbiome story.</v>

385
00:17:25.671 --> 00:17:26.780
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interestingly,</v>

386
00:17:26.781 --> 00:17:31.781
<v Speaker 1>they kind of pull it back and they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>got this kind of evolutionary biology </v>

387
00:17:31.781 --> 00:17:33.050
<v Speaker 1>picture that they look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're thinking about sleep and your</v>

388
00:17:33.051 --> 00:17:35.930
<v Speaker 1>food and stress levels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social connectivity,</v>

389
00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:41.290
<v Speaker 1>and they really put all that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>together in a pretty good way and </v>

390
00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:42.650
<v Speaker 1>they're not chasing symptoms are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out root cause and then</v>

391
00:17:42.651 --> 00:17:45.500
<v Speaker 1>try to address that root cause and move </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward and they're pretty.</v>

392
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:49.100
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty good at figuring out like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got 18 things going,</v>

393
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:54.440
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the one thing we need to </v>

394
00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.181
<v Speaker 1>address first and then we'll knock that </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and go to the next one and the next </v>

395
00:17:56.181 --> 00:17:57.810
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now when they start applying,</v>

396
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:02.840
<v Speaker 1>say like probiotics are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are all probiotics are created </v>

397
00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.830
<v Speaker 1>equal in terms of like foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in terms of like supplementation,</v>

398
00:18:04.831 --> 00:18:09.831
<v Speaker 1>because I know there's some really </v>
<v Speaker 1>intense a probiotic supplements you can </v>

399
00:18:09.831 --> 00:18:12.870
<v Speaker 1>buy that you have to keep refrigerated </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

400
00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's huge variability in that.</v>

401
00:18:15.241 --> 00:18:18.090
<v Speaker 1>You have some people that when they add </v>
<v Speaker 1>probiotics,</v>

402
00:18:18.091 --> 00:18:22.110
<v Speaker 1>like just like Kimchi or Sauerkraut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>improve immediately liked their clinical</v>

403
00:18:22.111 --> 00:18:23.910
<v Speaker 1>symptoms improved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They feel better,</v>

404
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:29.360
<v Speaker 1>maybe depressive symptoms improve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get leaner and then you have other </v>

405
00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.450
<v Speaker 1>people that everything they have going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on get to worse,</v>

406
00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:35.810
<v Speaker 1>and these are the folks that you start </v>
<v Speaker 1>wondering if they have some small </v>

407
00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:35.810
<v Speaker 1>intestinal bacterial overgrowth.</v>

408
00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:41.120
<v Speaker 1>Do they add some reactivity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's these things called fodmaps are </v>

409
00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:41.460
<v Speaker 1>fermentable carbohydrates that can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

410
00:18:41.461 --> 00:18:46.461
<v Speaker 1>make the gut microbiome kind of freak </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and there's another layer to this </v>

411
00:18:46.461 --> 00:18:48.390
<v Speaker 1>which is called small intestinal fungal </v>
<v Speaker 1>overgrowth.</v>

412
00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:53.780
<v Speaker 1>So there are people out there that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a persistent fungal </v>

413
00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:56.580
<v Speaker 1>infection which doesn't get picked up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the general gut microbiome screening</v>

414
00:18:56.581 --> 00:18:58.710
<v Speaker 1>because they're looking at bacteria and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fungus.</v>

415
00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:04.040
<v Speaker 1>So this is a whole other layer to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story that people may have had a year's </v>

416
00:19:04.321 --> 00:19:09.321
<v Speaker 1>long decades long fungal infection in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the gut that is then disordering </v>

417
00:19:09.321 --> 00:19:11.640
<v Speaker 1>everything causing inflammation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>those are really,</v>

418
00:19:11.641 --> 00:19:14.880
<v Speaker 1>really difficult to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does one do when they have a fungal</v>

419
00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:19.940
<v Speaker 1>overgrowth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do some of the antifungals like </v>

420
00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:21.870
<v Speaker 1>Diflucan and and again some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>herbal preparations,</v>

421
00:19:21.871 --> 00:19:24.330
<v Speaker 1>but this is another layer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

422
00:19:24.331 --> 00:19:29.331
<v Speaker 1>kind of peeling the onion that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't that many practitioners that are </v>

423
00:19:29.331 --> 00:19:32.991
<v Speaker 1>even looking for that as an option and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then the treatment protocols are not </v>

424
00:19:32.991 --> 00:19:33.600
<v Speaker 1>super well edited out.</v>

425
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.970
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of experimentation that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens there.</v>

426
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.250
<v Speaker 1>Do they know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a dietary cause?</v>

427
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's always an influence on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the diet,</v>

428
00:19:42.391 --> 00:19:43.710
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>

429
00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:49.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>refined carbohydrates makes all this </v>

430
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:51.270
<v Speaker 1>stuff grow better and it disrupts the </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal gut flora.</v>

431
00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:53.730
<v Speaker 1>It causes inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

432
00:19:53.731 --> 00:19:56.400
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes people will go on a round of </v>
<v Speaker 1>antibiotics.</v>

433
00:19:56.401 --> 00:20:00.600
<v Speaker 1>The bacterial population gets pushed </v>
<v Speaker 1>down and then the fungal population,</v>

434
00:20:00.601 --> 00:20:05.601
<v Speaker 1>which is always there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but usually it's in some sort of a </v>

435
00:20:05.601 --> 00:20:06.390
<v Speaker 1>symbiotic balance with the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>microbes than the,</v>

436
00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.350
<v Speaker 1>the fungal infection or fungal </v>
<v Speaker 1>population can increase.</v>

437
00:20:10.351 --> 00:20:14.320
<v Speaker 1>And this is where some people will go on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a round of antibiotics and then they end</v>

438
00:20:14.321 --> 00:20:17.580
<v Speaker 1>up with some sort of a legitimate fungal</v>
<v Speaker 1>infection.</v>

439
00:20:17.581 --> 00:20:22.581
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they can see it on their skin and </v>

440
00:20:22.581 --> 00:20:22.581
<v Speaker 1>the doctor will prescribe some </v>
<v Speaker 1>antifungals for that,</v>

441
00:20:22.581 --> 00:20:26.961
<v Speaker 1>but you can also have this happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a low grade sub acute level </v>

442
00:20:26.961 --> 00:20:30.900
<v Speaker 1>where it's not bad enough where they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting rashes and hives,</v>

443
00:20:30.901 --> 00:20:34.620
<v Speaker 1>but it's bad enough that it's making </v>
<v Speaker 1>them sick and not kind of optimized.</v>

444
00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:40.130
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just so hard to figure out what's </v>

445
00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:42.441
<v Speaker 1>going on with you unless you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it seems like for the average </v>

446
00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:43.800
<v Speaker 1>person that has a full time job and </v>
<v Speaker 1>family and all that jazz,</v>

447
00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:49.340
<v Speaker 1>it's probably incredibly difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to the bottom of what your health </v>

448
00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:50.140
<v Speaker 1>issue is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It definitely can be,</v>

449
00:20:50.141 --> 00:20:55.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the average time for diagnosis of an </v>

450
00:20:55.141 --> 00:20:57.670
<v Speaker 1>autoimmune condition or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>celiac disease is like 12 to 15 years,</v>

451
00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:02.970
<v Speaker 1>so people are suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're suffering for a long time and </v>

452
00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:06.691
<v Speaker 1>it's not the easiest thing in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>to pin down because the symptoms are so </v>

453
00:21:06.691 --> 00:21:09.520
<v Speaker 1>variable from person to person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if you go to a good doc,</v>

454
00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:14.760
<v Speaker 1>particularly someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again kind of functional medicine </v>

455
00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:15.490
<v Speaker 1>training or they've got a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this evolutionary biology perspective,</v>

456
00:21:15.491 --> 00:21:20.491
<v Speaker 1>they usually ask a set of questions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more questions so that they can kind of </v>

457
00:21:20.491 --> 00:21:24.991
<v Speaker 1>narrow down what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're kind of doing the doc in </v>

458
00:21:24.991 --> 00:21:25.780
<v Speaker 1>the box deal and you've got five minutes</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this person,</v>

459
00:21:25.781 --> 00:21:30.781
<v Speaker 1>like they're just trying to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the script I'm going to write so </v>

460
00:21:30.781 --> 00:21:30.880
<v Speaker 1>I can move this person out and get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next person.</v>

461
00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:36.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's unfortunate and you're just not </v>

462
00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:36.080
<v Speaker 1>going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you get lucky,</v>

463
00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:36.640
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to figure out what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue is.</v>

464
00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:41.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would seem that the amount of time </v>

465
00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:43.831
<v Speaker 1>required to figure out what's wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person would also be very expensive </v>

466
00:21:43.831 --> 00:21:46.090
<v Speaker 1>and likely not covered by a whole lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare plans.</v>

467
00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:51.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's interesting like some of </v>

468
00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:52.180
<v Speaker 1>these functional medicine docs do a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>with pretty little,</v>

469
00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of what they're doing is a time</v>

470
00:21:55.721 --> 00:22:00.721
<v Speaker 1>investment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they'll do a two hour history and </v>

471
00:22:00.721 --> 00:22:03.781
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they can get the information the </v>

472
00:22:03.781 --> 00:22:03.781
<v Speaker 1>last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

473
00:22:03.781 --> 00:22:06.190
<v Speaker 1>what was your in utero environment like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like did your mom meet?</v>

474
00:22:06.191 --> 00:22:08.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did they smoke when you were born?</v>

475
00:22:08.201 --> 00:22:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Was it a vaginal birth or csection?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were you breastfed or not?</v>

476
00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:12.710
<v Speaker 1>When was your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

477
00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:16.750
<v Speaker 1>the approximate age of your first round </v>
<v Speaker 1>of antibiotics?</v>

478
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:20.280
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever go on tetracycline for </v>
<v Speaker 1>extended period of time for acne?</v>

479
00:22:20.281 --> 00:22:25.281
<v Speaker 1>And so they'll build a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive early life history and </v>

480
00:22:25.691 --> 00:22:28.030
<v Speaker 1>then try to March this thing forward in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last few questions,</v>

481
00:22:28.031 --> 00:22:32.080
<v Speaker 1>like did you ever travel out of country?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you get some sort of a gut bug while</v>

482
00:22:32.081 --> 00:22:37.081
<v Speaker 1>doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are some really important </v>

483
00:22:37.081 --> 00:22:39.391
<v Speaker 1>pieces but a well trained a practitioner</v>
<v Speaker 1>will rely a lot on the intake and then </v>

484
00:22:42.011 --> 00:22:44.260
<v Speaker 1>that will kind of inform where they go </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the testing.</v>

485
00:22:44.261 --> 00:22:49.261
<v Speaker 1>And so the testing might be a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive but you're not just casting </v>

486
00:22:49.261 --> 00:22:52.921
<v Speaker 1>around blindly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like because of that really thorough </v>

487
00:22:52.921 --> 00:22:54.790
<v Speaker 1>intake and kind of understanding the </v>
<v Speaker 1>early life history and trying to fair it</v>

488
00:22:54.791 --> 00:22:59.791
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's ever been like a big event </v>

489
00:22:59.791 --> 00:23:00.010
<v Speaker 1>that could be linked back to this health</v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis,</v>

490
00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.830
<v Speaker 1>then they can really dial in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>testing.</v>

491
00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Then depending on what they get from </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

492
00:23:04.661 --> 00:23:06.190
<v Speaker 1>they can make a treatment protocol.</v>

493
00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.410
<v Speaker 1>Try the treatment protocol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we have success,</v>

494
00:23:08.411 --> 00:23:09.550
<v Speaker 1>then good to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If not,</v>

495
00:23:09.551 --> 00:23:14.551
<v Speaker 1>then we start modifying from there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you say eating foods out of the </v>

496
00:23:14.861 --> 00:23:18.520
<v Speaker 1>country and catching some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bacterial infection out of that,</v>

497
00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:23.560
<v Speaker 1>that is one of the scariest things in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world to me because I've watched </v>

498
00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:23.560
<v Speaker 1>that stupid show too many times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

499
00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:24.930
<v Speaker 1>What are the enemy within or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

500
00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:28.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to think of your body as being</v>

501
00:23:28.451 --> 00:23:32.080
<v Speaker 1>like not just an organism but a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>ecosystem.</v>

502
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:33.270
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

503
00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:38.490
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff can come in and take up </v>

504
00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:38.490
<v Speaker 1>residence in new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't really want it.</v>

505
00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:40.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had grd at twice.</v>

506
00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:41.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's um,</v>

507
00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:44.190
<v Speaker 1>it's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bad news that uh,</v>

508
00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.470
<v Speaker 1>the first time I snorkeling and Mexico.</v>

509
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:51.500
<v Speaker 4>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so everybody in the main snorkeling </v>

510
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.461
<v Speaker 4>group was kind of out in the salt water </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then there was nobody over in this </v>

511
00:23:54.461 --> 00:23:54.530
<v Speaker 4>other area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I was like,</v>

512
00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:57.140
<v Speaker 4>I'll swim over here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But apparently there was a,</v>

513
00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:59.910
<v Speaker 4>it was an estuary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there was a salt water,</v>

514
00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:04.970
<v Speaker 4>fresh water interface.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I started swimming in the fresh </v>

515
00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:04.970
<v Speaker 4>water and then they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

516
00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:09.401
<v Speaker 4>you're really not supposed to swim in </v>
<v Speaker 4>there because this water out of a c no </v>

517
00:24:09.401 --> 00:24:12.300
<v Speaker 4>tay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like sometimes what's the c note to </v>

518
00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:12.300
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

519
00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:15.310
<v Speaker 4>the underground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm kind of fresh water springs that </v>

520
00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:18.941
<v Speaker 4>come out of a limestone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I interrupted you when you were saying </v>

521
00:24:18.941 --> 00:24:19.280
<v Speaker 4>people take Thompson out water dumping </v>
<v Speaker 4>the water.</v>

522
00:24:19.281 --> 00:24:20.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh boy.</v>

523
00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:21.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

524
00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.980
<v Speaker 4>I know you get the Rda from beaver poop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is another place.</v>

525
00:24:24.981 --> 00:24:29.981
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I don't know that there are beaver </v>

526
00:24:29.981 --> 00:24:31.451
<v Speaker 4>in the Yucatan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's some other carriers in </v>

527
00:24:31.451 --> 00:24:33.020
<v Speaker 4>Prince of Wales island once about a year</v>
<v Speaker 4>and a half ago,</v>

528
00:24:33.021 --> 00:24:38.021
<v Speaker 4>two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's really high up and it's above </v>

529
00:24:38.021 --> 00:24:38.270
<v Speaker 4>the line where beavers are.</v>

530
00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:42.920
<v Speaker 4>And so you could take a water bottle and</v>
<v Speaker 4>dip it into a lake and just drink it out</v>

531
00:24:42.921 --> 00:24:46.160
<v Speaker 4>of the lake and you feel it's so </v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous feeling,</v>

532
00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:51.640
<v Speaker 4>but they assured us they like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can absolutely drink right out of </v>

533
00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:51.640
<v Speaker 4>that lake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Man.</v>

534
00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.230
<v Speaker 4>That gives me a little gut rumblings </v>
<v Speaker 4>even thinking about it.</v>

535
00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.750
<v Speaker 4>And we had a float plane land on that </v>
<v Speaker 4>very lake.</v>

536
00:24:56.751 --> 00:24:58.490
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are the things leaking in the leg?</v>

537
00:24:58.491 --> 00:25:00.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm drinking diesel water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they're like,</v>

538
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:02.770
<v Speaker 4>there's millions of gallons of water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

539
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:04.160
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not going to affect you.</v>

540
00:25:04.161 --> 00:25:05.720
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it says it says you.</v>

541
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:08.630
<v Speaker 4>What if I scoop it right where the thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>dropped off?</v>

542
00:25:08.631 --> 00:25:10.760
<v Speaker 4>It's diesel fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

543
00:25:10.761 --> 00:25:13.010
<v Speaker 4>but it just seems weird that you can do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

544
00:25:13.011 --> 00:25:18.011
<v Speaker 4>And then it seems even weirder when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>think about the fact that you can't do </v>

545
00:25:18.011 --> 00:25:18.011
<v Speaker 4>that everywhere that most.</v>

546
00:25:18.011 --> 00:25:22.240
<v Speaker 4>Even though we're a giant percentage of </v>
<v Speaker 4>us as water really can't drink most </v>

547
00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.870
<v Speaker 4>water rate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My professor Loren Cordain,</v>

548
00:25:23.871 --> 00:25:26.510
<v Speaker 4>the guy who kind of founded this Paleo </v>
<v Speaker 4>Diet concept,</v>

549
00:25:26.511 --> 00:25:29.530
<v Speaker 4>he used to be a lifeguard at Lake Tahoe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

550
00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:31.610
<v Speaker 4>30 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>35 years ago,</v>

551
00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:36.380
<v Speaker 4>and they would jump off the pier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dive down where it was super deep,</v>

552
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.510
<v Speaker 4>really cold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>open up their water bottle,</v>

553
00:25:38.511 --> 00:25:39.860
<v Speaker 4>fill it up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>swing back up,</v>

554
00:25:39.861 --> 00:25:41.660
<v Speaker 4>drink it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can't do it now because the lake</v>

555
00:25:41.661 --> 00:25:44.570
<v Speaker 4>has ge already in it and a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>other weird things that happened.</v>

556
00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:46.190
<v Speaker 4>Well for him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing,</v>

557
00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:50.680
<v Speaker 4>nothing would happen to the lake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>More people moving in and just,</v>

558
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:55.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just kind of a volume of poor input</v>

559
00:25:55.611 --> 00:25:57.920
<v Speaker 4>at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kind of overwhelms the natural.</v>

560
00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.220
<v Speaker 4>We suck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We fucking ruined everything.</v>

561
00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:03.050
<v Speaker 4>Damn people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

562
00:26:03.051 --> 00:26:08.051
<v Speaker 4>most,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most indigenous cultures were savvy to </v>

563
00:26:08.051 --> 00:26:08.640
<v Speaker 4>the idea that you didn't take a dump and</v>
<v Speaker 4>your own water systems.</v>

564
00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:11.750
<v Speaker 4>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well they knew about parasites for sure.</v>

565
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:14.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean that was always a whole idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>about not eating pigs.</v>

566
00:26:14.751 --> 00:26:16.820
<v Speaker 4>All the religious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Excuse me,</v>

567
00:26:16.821 --> 00:26:21.821
<v Speaker 4>all the religious rules about not eating</v>
<v Speaker 4>pigs was a big part of it was because </v>

568
00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.050
<v Speaker 4>pigs eat almost everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

569
00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:29.080
<v Speaker 4>Everything that's on the ground and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>would eat something that has chicken </v>

570
00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:29.080
<v Speaker 4>gnosis in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People would get really,</v>

571
00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.760
<v Speaker 4>really sick from eating pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they had sort of determined that pigs</v>

572
00:26:31.761 --> 00:26:33.530
<v Speaker 4>were evil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right in shellfish.</v>

573
00:26:33.531 --> 00:26:35.420
<v Speaker 4>Similar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good friend of mine,</v>

574
00:26:35.421 --> 00:26:40.421
<v Speaker 4>John Durant did a book called the Paleo </v>
<v Speaker 4>Manifesto and he actually has a really </v>

575
00:26:40.461 --> 00:26:45.461
<v Speaker 4>interesting background,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has kind of a pretty deep kind of </v>

576
00:26:45.461 --> 00:26:45.461
<v Speaker 4>religious studies</v>

577
00:26:45.461 --> 00:26:49.160
<v Speaker 1>background and he would talk about some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these food prohibitions in different </v>

578
00:26:49.291 --> 00:26:52.170
<v Speaker 1>religions and then what we know about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

579
00:26:52.171 --> 00:26:57.171
<v Speaker 1>And so things like shellfish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever once while we get something </v>

580
00:26:57.171 --> 00:27:00.321
<v Speaker 1>like red tide or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the diatom overgrowth and these are </v>

581
00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:05.930
<v Speaker 1>filter feeders would pull all this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>in and then get loaded up with a toxin </v>

582
00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:10.010
<v Speaker 1>and it would kill you if you ate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so these food prohibitions really </v>

583
00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:11.340
<v Speaker 1>had some pretty good wisdom to them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>general.</v>

584
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.980
<v Speaker 1>But then there's also super goofy </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

585
00:27:13.981 --> 00:27:16.200
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty common across all </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures.</v>

586
00:27:16.201 --> 00:27:17.740
<v Speaker 1>Like people would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

587
00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:22.760
<v Speaker 1>kind of build into their systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these prohibitions against different </v>

588
00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:23.760
<v Speaker 1>foods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And oftentimes because of this,</v>

589
00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of bacterial or,</v>

590
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:27.590
<v Speaker 1>or a parasitic deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what,</v>

591
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:31.050
<v Speaker 1>like the kosher ones for like and meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>milk and meat together.</v>

592
00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:33.150
<v Speaker 1>You can't have milk meet together.</v>

593
00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.760
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what that's about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have to ask him about that.</v>

594
00:27:35.761 --> 00:27:37.920
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never heard anything about that.</v>

595
00:27:37.921 --> 00:27:41.100
<v Speaker 1>And then it's interesting in Islam than </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not that prohibition.</v>

596
00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:46.160
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know if that was just kind </v>

597
00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:46.160
<v Speaker 1>of like a fuck you to the Judeo </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian deal or what?</v>

598
00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:51.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what about eating fats with complex </v>

599
00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.070
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates or fats with sugars?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

600
00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:58.290
<v Speaker 1>does that affect your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your glucose levels like,</v>

601
00:27:58.291 --> 00:28:01.020
<v Speaker 1>and how it's absorbed by the body?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

602
00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.880
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like from person to person,</v>

603
00:28:02.881 --> 00:28:05.520
<v Speaker 1>it really varies a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for some people,</v>

604
00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:08.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you did something like a white potato</v>

605
00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:13.820
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to have a certain blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>glucose response from it and you put a </v>

606
00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:14.730
<v Speaker 1>good whack of butter or olive oil or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something in it,</v>

607
00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:20.180
<v Speaker 1>for one group of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would actually reduce or spread out </v>

608
00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:20.910
<v Speaker 1>the total glucose load.</v>

609
00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:25.910
<v Speaker 1>So your blood sugar wouldn't go is high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your total insulin load would be lesser </v>

610
00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:29.460
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence and then there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>other groups of folks that they will see</v>

611
00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:34.520
<v Speaker 1>an increase in blood glucose response </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a really pronounced increase in </v>

612
00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:39.080
<v Speaker 1>insulin response and is the the amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of fats that are in like the olive oil </v>

613
00:28:39.781 --> 00:28:44.781
<v Speaker 1>and the butter that's in the potato is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>uniform or they're measuring it very </v>

614
00:28:44.781 --> 00:28:45.660
<v Speaker 1>carefully to the studies that had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

615
00:28:45.661 --> 00:28:46.860
<v Speaker 1>They're quite uniform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

616
00:28:46.861 --> 00:28:48.970
<v Speaker 1>like to get in and do a pretty good job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're,</v>

617
00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:51.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>person needs x amount of carbohydrate,</v>

618
00:28:51.451 --> 00:28:56.451
<v Speaker 1>they add x amount of fat there kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>standardized for body weight so that </v>

619
00:28:56.451 --> 00:28:59.130
<v Speaker 1>you're diluting the glucose about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same amount from person to person.</v>

620
00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:04.610
<v Speaker 1>And so the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best understanding that I've seen </v>

621
00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:08.001
<v Speaker 1>out of this is just that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty good variability from person to </v>

622
00:29:08.001 --> 00:29:08.430
<v Speaker 1>person as to how they're gonna respond </v>
<v Speaker 1>to that.</v>

623
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:13.880
<v Speaker 1>So it's not always a case where adding </v>
<v Speaker 1>fat to a decently dense carbohydrate </v>

624
00:29:14.611 --> 00:29:18.150
<v Speaker 1>source is going to buy you anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For some people it is an improvement and</v>

625
00:29:18.151 --> 00:29:20.100
<v Speaker 1>for other people it's actually more of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

626
00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:25.280
<v Speaker 1>So you'd almost have to do like kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced the experiments that you're </v>

627
00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.060
<v Speaker 1>doing with your wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you take the blood levels post,</v>

628
00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:28.800
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what time periods.</v>

629
00:29:28.801 --> 00:29:32.630
<v Speaker 1>So you do it for the recommendation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called the seven day Carb,</v>

630
00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:35.580
<v Speaker 1>tested you 50 grams of carbs and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the net carb.</v>

631
00:29:35.581 --> 00:29:40.581
<v Speaker 1>So all the fiber subtracted out and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're doing something like black </v>

632
00:29:40.581 --> 00:29:41.260
<v Speaker 1>beans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a huge pile of beans because have a</v>

633
00:29:41.261 --> 00:29:43.750
<v Speaker 1>lot of protein and fiber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those things are hard to do.</v>

634
00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Something white rice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>White Rice or you know like gluten free </v>

635
00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:49.080
<v Speaker 1>bread or something would be a lot easier</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>

636
00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:50.110
<v Speaker 1>but you consume that.</v>

637
00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:53.260
<v Speaker 1>You set your timer for when you're done </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the meal.</v>

638
00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:58.320
<v Speaker 1>Two hours later you check your blood </v>
<v Speaker 1>glucose and for my methods I'd like to </v>

639
00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:02.800
<v Speaker 1>see that two hour mark probably under </v>
<v Speaker 1>150 milligrams per deciliter for folks,</v>

640
00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:07.210
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when we look at again,</v>

641
00:30:07.211 --> 00:30:10.300
<v Speaker 1>some a pre agricultural people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tend to have some really,</v>

642
00:30:10.301 --> 00:30:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Really Nice Blood Glucose responses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

643
00:30:13.541 --> 00:30:18.541
<v Speaker 1>from this weitzman paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we saw from that is if people </v>

644
00:30:18.541 --> 00:30:20.650
<v Speaker 1>control their blood glucose effectively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over time the inflammation drops,</v>

645
00:30:20.651 --> 00:30:25.651
<v Speaker 1>their gut microbiome improves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you could have two people that </v>

646
00:30:25.651 --> 00:30:28.870
<v Speaker 1>have a very different response to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>like rice or potatoes or something.</v>

647
00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:31.330
<v Speaker 1>And one person like my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of crazy.</v>

648
00:30:31.331 --> 00:30:34.090
<v Speaker 1>Like she can just crush this stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she does great.</v>

649
00:30:34.091 --> 00:30:37.270
<v Speaker 1>And interestingly she can eat a </v>
<v Speaker 1>ketogenic diet and do great.</v>

650
00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:42.300
<v Speaker 1>Like she just Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she can switch whatever fuels she wants </v>

651
00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:42.300
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she does fine with that.</v>

652
00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:47.070
<v Speaker 1>But if we keep that Gut microbiome or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the blood glucose response pretty </v>

653
00:30:47.231 --> 00:30:52.231
<v Speaker 1>consistently good than even someone like</v>
<v Speaker 1>me that kind of like pulled the genetic </v>

654
00:30:52.231 --> 00:30:53.750
<v Speaker 1>short card in the lottery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't,</v>

655
00:30:53.751 --> 00:30:56.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly what is wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

656
00:30:56.111 --> 00:30:59.200
<v Speaker 1>but I don't handle carbs that well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

657
00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:03.310
<v Speaker 1>if I eat in a way that my blood glucose </v>
<v Speaker 1>response looks like my wife,</v>

658
00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:06.320
<v Speaker 1>that my blood lipids look good and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>gut is healthier.</v>

659
00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Like everything else pulls into a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>spot.</v>

660
00:31:09.161 --> 00:31:11.210
<v Speaker 1>So even if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

661
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:16.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from that genetically talented side of </v>

662
00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:19.141
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can make your blood glucose </v>

663
00:31:19.141 --> 00:31:19.141
<v Speaker 1>response look like that genetically </v>
<v Speaker 1>talented person,</v>

664
00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:21.730
<v Speaker 1>then you should get most of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>metabolic benefits.</v>

665
00:31:21.731 --> 00:31:24.190
<v Speaker 1>You don't have as much latitude in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>day to day eating.</v>

666
00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:25.170
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

667
00:31:25.171 --> 00:31:30.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not everybody can flatfoot dunk a </v>

668
00:31:30.171 --> 00:31:30.400
<v Speaker 1>basketball or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you just have to take what you get.</v>

669
00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

670
00:31:31.451 --> 00:31:34.720
<v Speaker 1>So you just have to kind of figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is that your body requires.</v>

671
00:31:34.721 --> 00:31:38.560
<v Speaker 1>And the main goal is staying inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>these parameters.</v>

672
00:31:38.561 --> 00:31:39.370
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

673
00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:39.970
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

674
00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:43.720
<v Speaker 1>it's a tough thing for someone like me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You like I love the Paleo Diet,</v>

675
00:31:43.721 --> 00:31:46.990
<v Speaker 1>I love that basic concept and I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In general,</v>

676
00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:52.020
<v Speaker 1>if you throw out the following,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you say most people should eat </v>

677
00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.800
<v Speaker 1>whole unprocessed foods?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a lot of contention there,</v>

678
00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:59.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you get a little bit granular </v>

679
00:31:59.280 --> 00:31:59.500
<v Speaker 1>with that whole unprocessed foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be beans,</v>

680
00:31:59.501 --> 00:32:01.450
<v Speaker 1>it could be potatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweet potatoes.</v>

681
00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:04.000
<v Speaker 1>And for me it's interesting like </v>
<v Speaker 1>lentils,</v>

682
00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:06.940
<v Speaker 1>I do great width,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do a lot of lentils,</v>

683
00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:09.220
<v Speaker 1>do a decent amount of carbohydrate from </v>
<v Speaker 1>lentils.</v>

684
00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:12.670
<v Speaker 1>My Blood Glucose response is great if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>do rice,</v>

685
00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:15.520
<v Speaker 1>white potatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweet potatoes are better.</v>

686
00:32:15.521 --> 00:32:17.170
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rice and white potatoes,</v>

687
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.990
<v Speaker 1>I looked like a diabetic after eating </v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff.</v>

688
00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:21.630
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

689
00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:26.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though that general recommendation </v>

690
00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:27.610
<v Speaker 1>of eat whole unprocessed foods is </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally spot on,</v>

691
00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.460
<v Speaker 1>there's still a lot of details and </v>
<v Speaker 1>granularity in that,</v>

692
00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could be following a whole food diet</v>

693
00:32:32.801 --> 00:32:36.040
<v Speaker 1>and for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of your genetics or epigenetics,</v>

694
00:32:36.041 --> 00:32:39.860
<v Speaker 1>like your gut or maybe taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>antibiotics in the past,</v>

695
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:45.310
<v Speaker 1>you still may need to be really careful </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the amounts and types of </v>

696
00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:46.430
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates that you eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

697
00:32:46.431 --> 00:32:50.270
<v Speaker 1>Taking antibiotics in the past can </v>
<v Speaker 1>affect you that far in the future.</v>

698
00:32:50.271 --> 00:32:52.750
<v Speaker 1>Like how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of an effect like time wise.</v>

699
00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:56.660
<v Speaker 1>So there's two levels to this in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>

700
00:32:56.661 --> 00:32:59.630
<v Speaker 1>The one level is the gut microbiome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another level to it.</v>

701
00:32:59.631 --> 00:33:01.490
<v Speaker 1>Certain antibiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that they work,</v>

702
00:33:01.491 --> 00:33:06.491
<v Speaker 1>they interrupt the transcription and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>activity of the ribosomes in bacteria.</v>

703
00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:11.900
<v Speaker 1>But our mitochondria are effectively a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bacteria,</v>

704
00:33:11.901 --> 00:33:16.901
<v Speaker 1>like they have bacterial DNA in </v>
<v Speaker 1>ribosomes and even though in general,</v>

705
00:33:17.451 --> 00:33:22.451
<v Speaker 1>like mainstream medicine says that </v>
<v Speaker 1>antibiotics don't effect mitochondrial </v>

706
00:33:22.451 --> 00:33:22.451
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>

707
00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:27.260
<v Speaker 1>There's some pretty good papers that </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggest that antibiotics can disrupt and</v>

708
00:33:27.261 --> 00:33:31.100
<v Speaker 1>damage mitochondrial function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when your Mitochondria gets sick,</v>

709
00:33:31.101 --> 00:33:36.101
<v Speaker 1>you die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is so much of what Rhonda </v>

710
00:33:36.101 --> 00:33:36.101
<v Speaker 1>Patrick Talks about with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

711
00:33:36.101 --> 00:33:40.121
<v Speaker 1>the benefits of fasting and having </v>
<v Speaker 1>really good micro nutrient density and </v>

712
00:33:40.121 --> 00:33:43.481
<v Speaker 1>whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know what Tim Ferriss pinged me </v>

713
00:33:43.481 --> 00:33:46.340
<v Speaker 1>a question about why is lyme disease has</v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten so much worse for people,</v>

714
00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:47.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use to.</v>

715
00:33:47.151 --> 00:33:49.460
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of like catching a cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

716
00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:52.160
<v Speaker 1>a lived in upstate New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody seemed to get it.</v>

717
00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:55.430
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't something that would cripple </v>
<v Speaker 1>people over the long haul.</v>

718
00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:58.220
<v Speaker 1>And now you're seeing a lot of longterm </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

719
00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:03.460
<v Speaker 1>But my question was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it really the lyme disease or is it </v>

720
00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:05.320
<v Speaker 1>the damage to the Mitochondria from </v>
<v Speaker 1>being on antibiotics longterm?</v>

721
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Because the lyme disease requires a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really long treatment protocol with </v>

722
00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:11.300
<v Speaker 1>antibiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>

723
00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:14.840
<v Speaker 1>But isn't it even worse for people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>go misdiagnosed?</v>

724
00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:20.200
<v Speaker 1>And so they don't get on the antibiotics</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time and the lyme disease </v>

725
00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:20.200
<v Speaker 1>gets deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

726
00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:20.540
<v Speaker 1>deep into their system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

727
00:34:20.541 --> 00:34:23.360
<v Speaker 1>I honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know much on that side.</v>

728
00:34:23.361 --> 00:34:26.630
<v Speaker 1>I've been looking so much at this kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of mitochondrial dysfunction side.</v>

729
00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:30.620
<v Speaker 1>I can't really comment much on like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm untreated lyme disease.</v>

730
00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:35.290
<v Speaker 1>Lyme disease is a scary thing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many ticks that have it now.</v>

731
00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.970
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to some people this </v>
<v Speaker 1>weekend and they were like,</v>

732
00:34:37.971 --> 00:34:38.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom's got it.</v>

733
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:40.490
<v Speaker 1>My Dad's got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

734
00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:45.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many Goddamn people are getting lit </v>

735
00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.120
<v Speaker 1>up by these ticks and catching this </v>
<v Speaker 1>little freaky disease.</v>

736
00:34:47.121 --> 00:34:49.310
<v Speaker 1>And where was it 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 years ago,</v>

737
00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:50.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny.</v>

738
00:34:50.091 --> 00:34:52.720
<v Speaker 1>Npr just had a piece on this and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

739
00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:57.760
<v Speaker 1>some of the modern farming practices has</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed off the predators that would </v>

740
00:34:58.041 --> 00:35:00.350
<v Speaker 1>normally knock the tick population down.</v>

741
00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Like what I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget,</v>

742
00:35:01.971 --> 00:35:02.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

743
00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.450
<v Speaker 1>I literally just kind of scanned it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

744
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:06.170
<v Speaker 1>somebody that commented on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

745
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:11.230
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is why we have free range chickens </v>

746
00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:11.230
<v Speaker 1>on her property to basically keep the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tick population down.</v>

747
00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:16.110
<v Speaker 1>But part of what is suppressing that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the free range chickens are eating </v>

748
00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:18.590
<v Speaker 1>mice and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the mice are a vector that allows the</v>

749
00:35:18.591 --> 00:35:21.110
<v Speaker 1>ticks to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to grow and populate.</v>

750
00:35:21.111 --> 00:35:22.690
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

751
00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:24.140
<v Speaker 1>I just scanned this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

752
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:29.170
<v Speaker 1>it was interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was suggesting that the kind of </v>

753
00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:31.891
<v Speaker 1>mono cropping process of what we've done</v>
<v Speaker 1>with modern agriculture has created this</v>

754
00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:36.240
<v Speaker 1>gap where we now have pes like Mammalian</v>
<v Speaker 1>pest,</v>

755
00:35:36.241 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 1>like mice and moles that</v>

756
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:43.100
<v Speaker 2>are a vector for the ticks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they've just got more surface </v>

757
00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:43.100
<v Speaker 2>area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more more uh,</v>

758
00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:44.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real estate that they can live on.</v>

759
00:35:44.491 --> 00:35:49.491
<v Speaker 2>And so their population has grown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a really important factor for </v>

760
00:35:49.491 --> 00:35:53.361
<v Speaker 2>people that don't like coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot of people that are </v>

761
00:35:53.361 --> 00:35:54.150
<v Speaker 2>very angry that coyote coyote ate my </v>
<v Speaker 2>dog.</v>

762
00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.130
<v Speaker 2>Like I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it is terrible.</v>

763
00:35:56.131 --> 00:35:57.400
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the coyote,</v>

764
00:35:57.401 --> 00:35:59.180
<v Speaker 2>he also eats every rat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

765
00:35:59.181 --> 00:36:04.181
<v Speaker 2>You can find,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's one of the reasons why rats </v>

766
00:36:04.181 --> 00:36:04.181
<v Speaker 2>aren't everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you go to New York City,</v>

767
00:36:04.181 --> 00:36:06.740
<v Speaker 2>you see very few coyotes and I'll fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>load of rats.</v>

768
00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:12.170
<v Speaker 2>And what would you rather have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'd rather have a few coyotes </v>

769
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:14.901
<v Speaker 2>every now and then the occasional loss </v>
<v Speaker 2>cat then fucking black plague running </v>

770
00:36:14.901 --> 00:36:14.901
<v Speaker 2>through your neighborhood in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>suburbs.</v>

771
00:36:14.901 --> 00:36:15.900
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

772
00:36:15.901 --> 00:36:17.820
<v Speaker 2>they have eaten three of my cats in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Reno,</v>

773
00:36:17.821 --> 00:36:19.740
<v Speaker 2>so I do smoke a lot.</v>

774
00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:24.390
<v Speaker 2>How do you get them archery or with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>suppressed rifle?</v>

775
00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:25.700
<v Speaker 2>Awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doors.</v>

776
00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:29.310
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that when you kill coyotes </v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually increased the population?</v>

777
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:33.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no head off and yeah,</v>

778
00:36:33.361 --> 00:36:34.320
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

779
00:36:34.321 --> 00:36:38.100
<v Speaker 2>but that's the reason why there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>coyotes in every single state.</v>

780
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:42.270
<v Speaker 2>And we have a podcast coming up with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy named Dan Flores who,</v>

781
00:36:42.271 --> 00:36:47.271
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote a book called Coyote America that </v>

782
00:36:47.271 --> 00:36:47.271
<v Speaker 2>I read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking amazing.</v>

783
00:36:47.271 --> 00:36:49.200
<v Speaker 2>But coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they yell out what they're doing,</v>

784
00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:55.130
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing roll call and they all </v>

785
00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:56.250
<v Speaker 2>chime in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when one is missing,</v>

786
00:36:56.251 --> 00:37:00.420
<v Speaker 2>it triggers a response in the female to </v>
<v Speaker 2>produce more cubs.</v>

787
00:37:00.421 --> 00:37:02.490
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in healthy conditions,</v>

788
00:37:02.491 --> 00:37:07.491
<v Speaker 2>when they're not being pressured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the female will produce like three or </v>

789
00:37:07.491 --> 00:37:08.520
<v Speaker 2>few cups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they are being pressured,</v>

790
00:37:08.521 --> 00:37:13.521
<v Speaker 2>they'll produce like a dozen or more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy lake and spread out to change</v>

791
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:14.730
<v Speaker 2>their area.</v>

792
00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:18.090
<v Speaker 2>Humans will be long gone and coyotes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>cockroaches will still be here.</v>

793
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:19.770
<v Speaker 2>They will inherit the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

794
00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:24.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also amazing how many native </v>

795
00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:25.860
<v Speaker 2>American myths and stories evolved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

796
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:31.190
<v Speaker 2>about the coyote and about how the </v>
<v Speaker 2>coyote was this sort of God that was </v>

797
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:34.641
<v Speaker 2>kind of watching over everything and was</v>
<v Speaker 2>responsible for creation and a lot of </v>

798
00:37:34.641 --> 00:37:38.091
<v Speaker 2>other things like really weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freaky smart little animal is a wolf </v>

799
00:37:38.091 --> 00:37:38.400
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>

800
00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:39.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

801
00:37:39.781 --> 00:37:44.781
<v Speaker 2>I had read some stuff about the Coi wolf</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the wolf populations had been </v>

802
00:37:44.781 --> 00:37:47.580
<v Speaker 2>really pushed back and so they started </v>
<v Speaker 2>crossbreeding with coyotes.</v>

803
00:37:47.581 --> 00:37:50.760
<v Speaker 2>And so now we're coyotes were maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>about like 25,</v>

804
00:37:50.761 --> 00:37:54.210
<v Speaker 2>30 pounds now there'll be 70 or 80 </v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds and they hunt in packs.</v>

805
00:37:54.211 --> 00:37:56.940
<v Speaker 2>And so they've got these characteristics</v>
<v Speaker 2>of wolves and coyotes.</v>

806
00:37:56.941 --> 00:38:01.941
<v Speaker 2>And quite a few of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things that's important </v>

807
00:38:01.941 --> 00:38:02.670
<v Speaker 2>is that coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when a coyote and wolf breed,</v>

808
00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:04.380
<v Speaker 2>they're basically the same animal.</v>

809
00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:07.800
<v Speaker 2>So even though there's variations in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way they behave,</v>

810
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.010
<v Speaker 2>particularly in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coyotes can hunt alone and they can hunt</v>

811
00:38:11.011 --> 00:38:16.011
<v Speaker 2>in packs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas Wolf's almost exclusively hunt </v>

812
00:38:16.011 --> 00:38:16.011
<v Speaker 2>in packs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

813
00:38:16.011 --> 00:38:16.011
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

814
00:38:16.011 --> 00:38:16.200
<v Speaker 2>they shared DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

815
00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:18.240
<v Speaker 2>when they have babies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're viable.</v>

816
00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:19.950
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like a hybrid.</v>

817
00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:21.840
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're basically the same animal.</v>

818
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.550
<v Speaker 2>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

819
00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:24.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're everywhere.</v>

820
00:38:24.601 --> 00:38:27.210
<v Speaker 2>They're apparently they're having a real</v>
<v Speaker 2>issue with them in New York City.</v>

821
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:30.090
<v Speaker 2>You have them in central park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have them in Queens.</v>

822
00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:35.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The urban areas are some of the most </v>

823
00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:35.900
<v Speaker 2>vibrant locations for the coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

824
00:38:35.901 --> 00:38:38.440
<v Speaker 2>And I mean they just crush like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

825
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:39.670
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

826
00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:40.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pet population.</v>

827
00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:42.810
<v Speaker 2>Like you love your pets out at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're,</v>

828
00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:45.220
<v Speaker 2>it's Russian roulette with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

829
00:38:45.221 --> 00:38:48.730
<v Speaker 2>it's even though the day man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have chickens and I had one chicken,</v>

830
00:38:48.731 --> 00:38:53.731
<v Speaker 2>one of my chickens got stolen by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>coyote and I watched him hop the fence </v>

831
00:38:53.731 --> 00:38:54.430
<v Speaker 2>with it in his mouth and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

832
00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:59.500
<v Speaker 2>It turned out her mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turned out she was a female and she </v>

833
00:38:59.500 --> 00:38:59.500
<v Speaker 2>had cubs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

834
00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:03.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was trying to figure out what to </v>

835
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.470
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just kind of let it alone.</v>

836
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:06.841
<v Speaker 2>I was going to kill her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to figure out a way to kill </v>

837
00:39:06.841 --> 00:39:06.841
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then I thought,</v>

838
00:39:06.841 --> 00:39:08.320
<v Speaker 2>well if I kill her then the like part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

839
00:39:08.321 --> 00:39:11.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't want the babies grow up and kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>my chickens more.</v>

840
00:39:11.171 --> 00:39:14.380
<v Speaker 2>But then the other thing is I don't want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to stop a mother from feeding.</v>

841
00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:17.290
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I fucked up.</v>

842
00:39:17.291 --> 00:39:21.640
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't secure the yard enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was my fault and there's a game being</v>

843
00:39:21.641 --> 00:39:25.480
<v Speaker 2>played in the game is stay alive and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>chickens are playing away.</v>

844
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:27.970
<v Speaker 2>Easier version of stay alive and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>coyote is.</v>

845
00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:29.950
<v Speaker 2>So I felt like I had to give her that </v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

846
00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:30.770
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

847
00:39:30.771 --> 00:39:34.330
<v Speaker 2>You got that one on the board.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't eat my fucking dog.</v>

848
00:39:34.331 --> 00:39:35.230
<v Speaker 2>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll kill you.</v>

849
00:39:35.231 --> 00:39:36.240
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

850
00:39:36.241 --> 00:39:37.990
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where it crosses the line.</v>

851
00:39:37.991 --> 00:39:39.400
<v Speaker 2>Like my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my appreciation,</v>

852
00:39:39.401 --> 00:39:44.200
<v Speaker 2>love for my chickens is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a 1000th of my cat.</v>

853
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:45.250
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

854
00:39:45.251 --> 00:39:45.940
<v Speaker 2>So it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

855
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:50.020
<v Speaker 2>Well my wife convinced me to get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rhodesian ridgeback.</v>

856
00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:52.450
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are the dog and he's a great dog.</v>

857
00:39:52.451 --> 00:39:57.451
<v Speaker 2>He's about 105 pounds and two percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>body fat and I wouldn't want them </v>

858
00:39:57.451 --> 00:40:01.981
<v Speaker 2>getting mixed up in a pack of coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think he could probably hold his </v>

859
00:40:01.981 --> 00:40:04.570
<v Speaker 2>own for a good bit if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if something went down sneaky though,</v>

860
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:07.570
<v Speaker 2>one of them will come out and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>like taunt them.</v>

861
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:09.190
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they'll chase them and then the</v>

862
00:40:09.191 --> 00:40:14.191
<v Speaker 2>other ones we'll ambush or like if the </v>
<v Speaker 2>female lou the coyote is is a fertile at</v>

863
00:40:15.011 --> 00:40:20.011
<v Speaker 2>that point and either pumping out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pheromones in the lure or the dog away </v>

864
00:40:20.011 --> 00:40:20.011
<v Speaker 2>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

865
00:40:20.011 --> 00:40:24.151
<v Speaker 2>you didn't get any action and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna eat you a great story that this </v>

866
00:40:24.151 --> 00:40:27.751
<v Speaker 2>guy told me who worked at my pet food </v>
<v Speaker 2>store and he also works as a nurse in a </v>

867
00:40:27.751 --> 00:40:32.611
<v Speaker 2>veterinary office and they brought this </v>
<v Speaker 2>pit bull and it was one of those freak </v>

868
00:40:32.611 --> 00:40:34.420
<v Speaker 2>pitbulls that people breed and get it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 120 pounds.</v>

869
00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:35.770
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen those?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's A.</v>

870
00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:40.920
<v Speaker 2>There's a company called land of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>giants and I think they're in </v>

871
00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:42.250
<v Speaker 2>Massachusetts and they make these pit </v>
<v Speaker 2>bulls that look like bodybuilders.</v>

872
00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:44.200
<v Speaker 2>They don't even look real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

873
00:40:44.201 --> 00:40:49.201
<v Speaker 2>this guy had a pit bull like that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they brought it into the vet's office </v>

874
00:40:49.201 --> 00:40:53.131
<v Speaker 2>and it was just covered in massive cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It required something in the range of a </v>

875
00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:55.780
<v Speaker 2>thousand plus stitches all over its </v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

876
00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:57.130
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened?</v>

877
00:40:57.131 --> 00:40:58.210
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

878
00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:02.020
<v Speaker 2>That dog got out of the yard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's just just covered insurance.</v>

879
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:04.990
<v Speaker 2>They figured maybe it was a dog fight or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something they didn't know,</v>

880
00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:10.410
<v Speaker 2>but there was just a trail of blood that</v>
<v Speaker 2>lead from his house up into the hills </v>

881
00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:14.470
<v Speaker 2>where he found nine dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coyotes smokes.</v>

882
00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:19.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they just laid a trap for him and he </v>

883
00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:21.970
<v Speaker 2>just fucked him all up like a huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>mistake.</v>

884
00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:27.460
<v Speaker 2>And he brought this freak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this brock Lesnar pit bull into our </v>

885
00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:27.930
<v Speaker 2>midst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he just mauled in.</v>

886
00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:30.100
<v Speaker 2>The whole family is gone now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's dead.</v>

887
00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:32.170
<v Speaker 2>He killed them all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He tore them apart,</v>

888
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:34.880
<v Speaker 2>like in apparently they just kept </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting.</v>

889
00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:36.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what happened,</v>

890
00:41:36.201 --> 00:41:38.470
<v Speaker 2>but he said it was spread out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

891
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:41.240
<v Speaker 2>the carnage was spread out over several </v>
<v Speaker 2>yards.</v>

892
00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:42.100
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

893
00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:43.670
<v Speaker 2>this pit bull,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just what town?</v>

894
00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:46.310
<v Speaker 2>Pimples or pop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

895
00:41:46.311 --> 00:41:48.170
<v Speaker 2>they're just amazing animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

896
00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:52.730
<v Speaker 2>they are incredibly strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That jaw power is just off the hook.</v>

897
00:41:52.731 --> 00:41:54.590
<v Speaker 2>They're really smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

898
00:41:54.591 --> 00:41:56.480
<v Speaker 2>they're a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be a handful,</v>

899
00:41:56.481 --> 00:41:58.800
<v Speaker 2>especially if it's like 130 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Jack,</v>

900
00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:04.550
<v Speaker 2>the thing about the pit bull is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not worried about dying the way of </v>

901
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:05.420
<v Speaker 2>coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coyotes,</v>

902
00:42:05.421 --> 00:42:08.690
<v Speaker 2>because no one's feeding them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their whole thing is like stay alive,</v>

903
00:42:08.691 --> 00:42:09.790
<v Speaker 2>survive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

904
00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:12.650
<v Speaker 2>attack and kill something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't fight to the death.</v>

905
00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:17.670
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas a pit bull is essentially bred </v>

906
00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:18.440
<v Speaker 2>to fight to the death and the ones that </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't,</v>

907
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:20.690
<v Speaker 2>they were removed from the breeding </v>
<v Speaker 2>population,</v>

908
00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:25.010
<v Speaker 2>like the horrible truth of pit bull </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting is like that.</v>

909
00:42:25.011 --> 00:42:30.011
<v Speaker 2>Michael Vick story were the ones that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would quit or the ones that would turn </v>

910
00:42:30.011 --> 00:42:30.110
<v Speaker 2>that wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't engage in the fight.</v>

911
00:42:30.111 --> 00:42:32.570
<v Speaker 2>They would kill them in torture comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible,</v>

912
00:42:32.571 --> 00:42:33.980
<v Speaker 2>horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible stuff.</v>

913
00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:36.380
<v Speaker 2>But because of that really nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cruel,</v>

914
00:42:36.381 --> 00:42:38.420
<v Speaker 2>vicious way of approaching the dog </v>
<v Speaker 2>breeding,</v>

915
00:42:38.421 --> 00:42:43.421
<v Speaker 2>what they get is this bloodline of for </v>
<v Speaker 2>warriors that just have no fear of death</v>

916
00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:47.960
<v Speaker 2>and when you get one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 120 pounds like that.</v>

917
00:42:47.961 --> 00:42:49.320
<v Speaker 2>Like fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

918
00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:51.230
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a giant mistake.</v>

919
00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:57.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it 120 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might be making that number up is </v>

920
00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:57.280
<v Speaker 2>huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huge pit bull.</v>

921
00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:59.690
<v Speaker 2>I think they way they're supposed to run</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 60 pounds I think at the upper end.</v>

922
00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:04.690
<v Speaker 2>So when you start doubling that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a real fighter ones are 35 </v>

923
00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:04.690
<v Speaker 2>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

924
00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:06.230
<v Speaker 2>And when they fight them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're small,</v>

925
00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:08.060
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when people have this idea of a pit</v>

926
00:43:08.061 --> 00:43:10.640
<v Speaker 2>bull in their eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have this idea of a guard dog,</v>

927
00:43:10.641 --> 00:43:13.370
<v Speaker 2>but it's not really the ones that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

928
00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:18.400
<v Speaker 2>They're really not that big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but their physical muscles aren't that </v>

929
00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:22.721
<v Speaker 2>big because really it's all about having</v>
<v Speaker 2>the endurance and having the gameness to</v>

930
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:25.160
<v Speaker 2>attack and killed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull up this website,</v>

931
00:43:25.161 --> 00:43:27.980
<v Speaker 2>land of the giants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>land of the giants pit bulls.</v>

932
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:30.650
<v Speaker 2>Because like a friend of my senate to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like,</v>

933
00:43:30.651 --> 00:43:35.651
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they've just figured out a way to </v>

934
00:43:35.651 --> 00:43:35.810
<v Speaker 2>do the same thing that the poultry </v>
<v Speaker 2>industry has done,</v>

935
00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:40.840
<v Speaker 2>just breed bigger and bigger chickens </v>
<v Speaker 2>until you have this fried chicken and </v>

936
00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:40.840
<v Speaker 2>can barely walk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

937
00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:43.100
<v Speaker 2>These guys have done that with pitbulls </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's just like,</v>

938
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:46.040
<v Speaker 2>it looks like they're breeding it with </v>
<v Speaker 2>something else,</v>

939
00:43:46.041 --> 00:43:51.041
<v Speaker 2>but it's really just maybe some Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the puppy chow or something that would </v>

940
00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:51.980
<v Speaker 2>that work.</v>

941
00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:53.920
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if people have done that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

942
00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:57.440
<v Speaker 2>like inject steroids and guarantee </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody's done that.</v>

943
00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:58.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

944
00:43:58.611 --> 00:43:59.150
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

945
00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:02.190
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pitbulls,</v>

946
00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:03.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have an incredible bite,</v>

947
00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:08.890
<v Speaker 2>but what's really crazy is that a wolf </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a bite that's five times stronger </v>

948
00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:08.890
<v Speaker 2>than a pit bull.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

949
00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:09.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

950
00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:13.220
<v Speaker 2>Both has a bite that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's 2,500</v>

951
00:44:13.221 --> 00:44:15.820
<v Speaker 2>pounds per square inch versus 500 for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

952
00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:21.010
<v Speaker 2>for the pit bull.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that thing isn't quite the same </v>

953
00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:23.171
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's their bigs were giants and </v>

954
00:44:23.171 --> 00:44:26.270
<v Speaker 2>that size of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is so ridiculous.</v>

955
00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:29.000
<v Speaker 2>A lot of dog that it's such a ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 2>dog.</v>

956
00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.950
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that land of the giants </v>
<v Speaker 2>website?</v>

957
00:44:31.951 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 2>Did</v>

958
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:37.040
<v Speaker 3>you find it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I typed it in and just like a facebook </v>

959
00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:37.040
<v Speaker 3>page popped up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

960
00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:38.610
<v Speaker 3>I wonder forums asking about them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they might've went under.</v>

961
00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:41.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

962
00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:42.680
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

963
00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:45.590
<v Speaker 3>it's really crazy that all these years</v>

964
00:44:45.610 --> 00:44:50.610
<v Speaker 4>dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's a Chihuahua or an English </v>

965
00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:50.610
<v Speaker 4>bulldog,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of them came from wolves.</v>

966
00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:55.950
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a four year old daughter asked me about </v>

967
00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:55.950
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was like,</v>

968
00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:56.920
<v Speaker 4>dad had were all dogs from wolves and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

969
00:44:56.921 --> 00:44:57.580
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she's like,</v>

970
00:44:57.581 --> 00:45:02.581
<v Speaker 4>how does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like I'm trying to explain genetics </v>

971
00:45:02.581 --> 00:45:03.370
<v Speaker 4>and genetic variability and everything </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was uh,</v>

972
00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:08.480
<v Speaker 4>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you could explain something to a kid </v>

973
00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:08.480
<v Speaker 4>then you've got a pretty good grasp on </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

974
00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:10.840
<v Speaker 4>But I think that she kinda Kinda got the</v>
<v Speaker 4>gist of it.</v>

975
00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:15.870
<v Speaker 4>The way I tried to explain it to someone</v>
<v Speaker 4>was that it's kind of like people </v>

976
00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:16.760
<v Speaker 4>because people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

977
00:45:16.761 --> 00:45:19.240
<v Speaker 4>you have like bridge damages and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>you get Shaquille o'neal,</v>

978
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:20.560
<v Speaker 4>they're both people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

979
00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:23.410
<v Speaker 4>But one of them obviously is a genetic </v>
<v Speaker 4>disorder,</v>

980
00:45:23.411 --> 00:45:26.980
<v Speaker 4>but you could sort of breed for that </v>
<v Speaker 4>genetic disorder.</v>

981
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:29.970
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And will the guy like Shaquille o'neal,</v>

982
00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:32.230
<v Speaker 4>me and Shaquille o'neal or in the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>species,</v>

983
00:45:32.231 --> 00:45:33.920
<v Speaker 4>like how's that even possible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

984
00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:36.220
<v Speaker 4>like they look so different.</v>

985
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:41.300
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that sort of like dogs that we by </v>

986
00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:44.200
<v Speaker 4>preference and breeding and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I guess geography as well,</v>

987
00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:45.900
<v Speaker 4>that's a huge factor as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But.</v>

988
00:45:45.901 --> 00:45:47.760
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it is interesting like that.</v>

989
00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:50.410
<v Speaker 4>The Wolf coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess like Dingoes,</v>

990
00:45:50.411 --> 00:45:54.940
<v Speaker 4>like there's a real uniformity there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like nature ended up pushing some things</v>

991
00:45:54.941 --> 00:45:58.420
<v Speaker 4>where they've got this kind of Snotty </v>
<v Speaker 4>Nis and they've got good hearing,</v>

992
00:45:58.421 --> 00:46:00.280
<v Speaker 4>a good smell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not like a hound dog,</v>

993
00:46:00.281 --> 00:46:01.640
<v Speaker 4>which has better smell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

994
00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:01.940
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

995
00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:07.080
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's also an interesting genetic </v>

996
00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:07.600
<v Speaker 4>variability in terms of what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>temperature their,</v>

997
00:46:07.601 --> 00:46:10.030
<v Speaker 4>their body has to be involved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like for,</v>

998
00:46:10.031 --> 00:46:12.160
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>certain mammals,</v>

999
00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:14.620
<v Speaker 4>when they grow farther north,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they become much,</v>

1000
00:46:14.621 --> 00:46:15.750
<v Speaker 4>much larger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1001
00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:20.940
<v Speaker 4>Like white tailed deer in like Alberta </v>
<v Speaker 4>can get to around 300 pounds.</v>

1002
00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:25.270
<v Speaker 4>Whereas in Texas they're only like 100 </v>
<v Speaker 4>pounds.</v>

1003
00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:27.370
<v Speaker 4>Maybe 1:50</v>
<v Speaker 4>is like a big deer,</v>

1004
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:28.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1005
00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:31.780
<v Speaker 4>it's fascinating that their body just </v>
<v Speaker 4>decides that,</v>

1006
00:46:31.781 --> 00:46:32.600
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way,</v>

1007
00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.810
<v Speaker 4>the best way to stay warm is to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>enormous,</v>

1008
00:46:34.850 --> 00:46:35.120
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1009
00:46:35.590 --> 00:46:39.440
<v Speaker 4>It's more round and shorter limbs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

1010
00:46:39.490 --> 00:46:44.490
<v Speaker 4>Stuff was like polar bears are some of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the largest bears or Kodiak Alaska </v>

1011
00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:48.691
<v Speaker 4>bears,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is sort of a perfect example </v>

1012
00:46:48.691 --> 00:46:49.690
<v Speaker 4>because in Kodiak island,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those brown bears have access to massive</v>

1013
00:46:49.691 --> 00:46:54.691
<v Speaker 4>amounts of protein and salmon and </v>
<v Speaker 4>beached whales and deer and bonds and </v>

1014
00:46:54.691 --> 00:46:57.160
<v Speaker 4>things like that because they're just </v>
<v Speaker 4>such a genetic.</v>

1015
00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:02.660
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's such a genetically powerful </v>

1016
00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:05.521
<v Speaker 4>creature as is a brown bear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then give them all this massive </v>

1017
00:47:05.521 --> 00:47:09.631
<v Speaker 4>amounts of protein and incredible food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then on top of that it's freezing </v>

1018
00:47:09.631 --> 00:47:12.871
<v Speaker 4>fucking cold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they just become these enormous </v>

1019
00:47:12.871 --> 00:47:12.871
<v Speaker 4>behemoths.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

1020
00:47:12.871 --> 00:47:13.180
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1021
00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:14.470
<v Speaker 4>That's</v>

1022
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:20.990
<v Speaker 3>came out about dinosaurs today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were just talking about the </v>

1023
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:20.990
<v Speaker 3>dinosaurs are real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

1024
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:20.990
<v Speaker 3>Did you watch that podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not about that.</v>

1025
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.890
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that some.</v>

1026
00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:24.480
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some scientists did a bunch of research.</v>

1027
00:47:24.481 --> 00:47:26.820
<v Speaker 3>He did like three years of research on </v>
<v Speaker 3>himself or on his own.</v>

1028
00:47:26.821 --> 00:47:30.510
<v Speaker 3>He said he went into museums and </v>
<v Speaker 3>studying the bone fragments and uh,</v>

1029
00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:35.640
<v Speaker 3>he put all of his information into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>computer program and after five minutes </v>

1030
00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:37.540
<v Speaker 3>it spit out something that said that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all of the,</v>

1031
00:47:37.541 --> 00:47:40.630
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are the two major like dinosaur family,</v>

1032
00:47:40.631 --> 00:47:45.631
<v Speaker 3>trees are different side of this little </v>
<v Speaker 3>sun was up here is like what you </v>

1033
00:47:45.631 --> 00:47:49.921
<v Speaker 3>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said this is something like telling </v>

1034
00:47:49.921 --> 00:47:50.650
<v Speaker 3>you that either cats or dogs or what you</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought they were.</v>

1035
00:47:50.651 --> 00:47:53.110
<v Speaker 3>And some of the animals you call cats </v>
<v Speaker 3>are actually dogs.</v>

1036
00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:54.620
<v Speaker 3>This is what I discovered.</v>

1037
00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:55.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is sort of like,</v>

1038
00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:56.630
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like that.</v>

1039
00:47:57.130 --> 00:47:57.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1040
00:47:57.581 --> 00:48:00.160
<v Speaker 2>So for a dummy like me that doesn't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>much about dinosaurs,</v>

1041
00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:03.700
<v Speaker 2>theropods to all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the classic tree.</v>

1042
00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:04.870
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is it,</v>

1043
00:48:04.871 --> 00:48:05.790
<v Speaker 2>what are they saying though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

1044
00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:08.550
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were there from might be diff,</v>

1045
00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:13.580
<v Speaker 3>like they stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this particular kind came from South </v>

1046
00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:13.580
<v Speaker 3>America before and now it might have </v>
<v Speaker 3>come from Norway.</v>

1047
00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:15.660
<v Speaker 3>Dinosaurs came from New Orleans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1048
00:48:15.661 --> 00:48:16.810
<v Speaker 3>That's why one of the things that stay </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

1049
00:48:16.811 --> 00:48:20.880
<v Speaker 3>so like this is one guy and at this news</v>
<v Speaker 3>hit the waves today.</v>

1050
00:48:20.881 --> 00:48:25.881
<v Speaker 3>It's like making big headlines all over </v>
<v Speaker 3>about like what does this information </v>

1051
00:48:25.881 --> 00:48:25.881
<v Speaker 3>mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1052
00:48:25.881 --> 00:48:27.420
<v Speaker 3>I was just thinking as you guys were </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying that about wolves,</v>

1053
00:48:27.421 --> 00:48:32.421
<v Speaker 3>that like what if they find out next </v>
<v Speaker 3>week that all doug didn't come from a </v>

1054
00:48:32.421 --> 00:48:33.630
<v Speaker 3>snake bite from cats or some shit like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1055
00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:35.630
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1056
00:48:36.110 --> 00:48:36.770
<v Speaker 2>How strange.</v>

1057
00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:38.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's super strange and their diets are a</v>

1058
00:48:38.681 --> 00:48:40.960
<v Speaker 3>little different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had some real small ones,</v>

1059
00:48:40.961 --> 00:48:45.961
<v Speaker 3>had different kinds of teeth that proved</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they were omnivores and not </v>

1060
00:48:45.961 --> 00:48:46.870
<v Speaker 3>necessarily like carnivores are </v>
<v Speaker 3>herbivores or whatever.</v>

1061
00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:52.880
<v Speaker 1>That's a good lesson in like all science</v>
<v Speaker 1>should have a sign hung on it that says </v>

1062
00:48:53.091 --> 00:48:57.020
<v Speaker 1>good until further notice and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like turn it into religious doctrine and</v>

1063
00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:59.990
<v Speaker 1>assume that it's 100 percent factual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1064
00:48:59.991 --> 00:49:04.970
<v Speaker 1>we create models and hopefully those </v>
<v Speaker 1>models help us kind of predict and model</v>

1065
00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:06.700
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1066
00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:08.390
<v Speaker 1>when you get better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>newer information,</v>

1067
00:49:08.391 --> 00:49:09.860
<v Speaker 1>you may have to scuttle that whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1068
00:49:10.070 --> 00:49:15.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was an article that I tweeted and </v>

1069
00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:16.661
<v Speaker 2>then a followup article earlier today or</v>
<v Speaker 2>last night rather about a scientific </v>

1070
00:49:17.331 --> 00:49:22.331
<v Speaker 2>journals about some scandals that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerging from scientific journals or </v>

1071
00:49:22.331 --> 00:49:24.740
<v Speaker 2>scientific journals are essentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>operating on a pay to play basis.</v>

1072
00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:29.890
<v Speaker 2>Some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're publishing these things without </v>

1073
00:49:29.890 --> 00:49:31.390
<v Speaker 2>really vetting the information that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside the papers and ces.</v>

1074
00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:34.130
<v Speaker 2>It just seems like anytime money gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved and stuff,</v>

1075
00:49:34.131 --> 00:49:36.260
<v Speaker 2>people become assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sting,</v>

1076
00:49:36.261 --> 00:49:38.300
<v Speaker 2>operation reveal sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>insane.</v>

1077
00:49:38.301 --> 00:49:40.970
<v Speaker 2>Fake news problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the term fake news,</v>

1078
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.220
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just such an anti intellectual.</v>

1079
00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:45.320
<v Speaker 2>It's so anti intellectual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1080
00:49:45.321 --> 00:49:46.460
<v Speaker 2>like fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fake.</v>

1081
00:49:46.461 --> 00:49:48.410
<v Speaker 2>Like when Donald Trump says that you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>fake news,</v>

1082
00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:50.310
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how are you allow that?</v>

1083
00:49:50.311 --> 00:49:55.311
<v Speaker 2>Like there should be a like a list of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that would disqualify you from </v>

1084
00:49:55.311 --> 00:49:58.691
<v Speaker 2>being the president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like as soon as you say that you're </v>

1085
00:49:58.691 --> 00:49:58.691
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you say that?</v>

1086
00:49:58.691 --> 00:49:58.691
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1087
00:49:58.691 --> 00:49:58.880
<v Speaker 2>You got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to step down,</v>

1088
00:49:58.970 --> 00:49:59.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't.</v>

1089
00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:01.760
<v Speaker 2>You can't call CNN fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1090
00:50:01.761 --> 00:50:03.160
<v Speaker 2>You are fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1091
00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:05.870
<v Speaker 2>they are the news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might think they're biased.</v>

1092
00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:11.050
<v Speaker 2>You make thing that you might be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>point out some inaccuracies and make </v>

1093
00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:14.951
<v Speaker 2>them make print a retraction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet calling them fake news like </v>

1094
00:50:14.951 --> 00:50:19.601
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just that term that anyone can use and </v>

1095
00:50:19.601 --> 00:50:21.890
<v Speaker 2>it's such a small mouth noise to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>news fake news and you say next.</v>

1096
00:50:22.070 --> 00:50:23.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>next like Whoa,</v>

1097
00:50:23.751 --> 00:50:28.490
<v Speaker 2>buddy settled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're fucking with the entire process</v>

1098
00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:33.700
<v Speaker 4>that the district,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because of your own power and the </v>

1099
00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:34.940
<v Speaker 4>inconvenience of someone telling you </v>
<v Speaker 4>challenging things,</v>

1100
00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:40.180
<v Speaker 4>you're fucking with the entire process </v>
<v Speaker 4>of getting information to people.</v>

1101
00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:42.200
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this.</v>

1102
00:50:42.201 --> 00:50:44.750
<v Speaker 4>This last election cycle was really </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>

1103
00:50:44.751 --> 00:50:49.130
<v Speaker 4>Like is it a man?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1104
00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:52.160
<v Speaker 4>Like it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think kind of cool to be 50 years down</v>

1105
00:50:52.161 --> 00:50:54.140
<v Speaker 4>the road and look back at how all this </v>
<v Speaker 4>plays out.</v>

1106
00:50:54.141 --> 00:50:56.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that it's going to be great</v>
<v Speaker 4>living through it.</v>

1107
00:50:56.330 --> 00:51:01.330
<v Speaker 4>Like I have these thoughts that there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be like the Great North </v>

1108
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.340
<v Speaker 4>American States at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether the,</v>

1109
00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:08.390
<v Speaker 4>the s has like five different sub </v>
<v Speaker 4>countries after some horrific thing goes</v>

1110
00:51:08.601 --> 00:51:13.601
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it people are so entrenched in the </v>

1111
00:51:13.601 --> 00:51:17.201
<v Speaker 4>radiology and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's virtually impossible to get </v>

1112
00:51:17.201 --> 00:51:17.700
<v Speaker 4>somebody on the opposite side of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fence.</v>

1113
00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:21.530
<v Speaker 4>Avid discussion about anything in any </v>
<v Speaker 4>meeting of the minds.</v>

1114
00:51:21.531 --> 00:51:23.630
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting to me.</v>

1115
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:28.630
<v Speaker 4>I really think social media is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>facilitated this historical yet like </v>

1116
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:29.970
<v Speaker 4>print paper for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1117
00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:33.020
<v Speaker 4>maybe a couple of hundred years and </v>
<v Speaker 4>people would have,</v>

1118
00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:38.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a community gatherings and they would </v>

1119
00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:40.211
<v Speaker 4>talk about different topics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that meeting in person and the </v>

1120
00:51:40.211 --> 00:51:44.470
<v Speaker 4>potential of pissing somebody off and </v>
<v Speaker 4>having them like try to beat you to </v>

1121
00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:47.891
<v Speaker 4>death or vice versa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is a certain civility that occurs </v>

1122
00:51:47.891 --> 00:51:51.371
<v Speaker 4>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And within social media you get those </v>

1123
00:51:51.371 --> 00:51:52.640
<v Speaker 4>same deep held beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then you don't have the ramification</v>

1124
00:51:52.641 --> 00:51:57.641
<v Speaker 4>of somebody wanting to kick the shit out</v>
<v Speaker 4>of you if you start upping the ante on </v>

1125
00:51:57.641 --> 00:51:59.130
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so like the,</v>

1126
00:51:59.190 --> 00:52:03.170
<v Speaker 4>the discourse is just crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's just no discussion.</v>

1127
00:52:03.171 --> 00:52:06.350
<v Speaker 4>There's no middle ground,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no understanding in this.</v>

1128
00:52:06.351 --> 00:52:11.351
<v Speaker 4>Let's last election cycle was really </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy and like it kind of broke me in </v>

1129
00:52:11.351 --> 00:52:11.351
<v Speaker 4>some ways.</v>

1130
00:52:11.351 --> 00:52:11.730
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1131
00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:16.760
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>am way less inclined to invest in much </v>

1132
00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:20.291
<v Speaker 4>of anything now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas before I would kind of bleed a </v>

1133
00:52:20.291 --> 00:52:20.970
<v Speaker 4>little bit for some social causes and </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to,</v>

1134
00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:22.880
<v Speaker 4>to put some thoughts out about </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

1135
00:52:22.881 --> 00:52:25.140
<v Speaker 4>But it was just kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck it,</v>

1136
00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:30.230
<v Speaker 4>I just don't care anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well there are a lot of people that </v>

1137
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:33.701
<v Speaker 4>invest tremendous amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a tremendous amount of time just </v>

1138
00:52:33.701 --> 00:52:37.600
<v Speaker 4>engaging with people and fighting and </v>
<v Speaker 4>arguing and insulting and attacking </v>

1139
00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:41.861
<v Speaker 4>people online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I have gone to a bunch of different </v>

1140
00:52:41.861 --> 00:52:43.700
<v Speaker 4>twitter pages where I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many hours is this guy on?</v>

1141
00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:46.460
<v Speaker 4>And then I check to see like when does </v>
<v Speaker 4>he start his tweets?</v>

1142
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:48.950
<v Speaker 4>And then there's people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>tweeting 12 hours a day.</v>

1143
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.340
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's all mean nasty attack shit.</v>

1144
00:52:52.341 --> 00:52:57.341
<v Speaker 4>Like some mentally ill person has a </v>
<v Speaker 4>computer and nothing is preventing them </v>

1145
00:52:57.341 --> 00:52:59.540
<v Speaker 4>from just going after people and </v>
<v Speaker 4>trolling people and attacking people.</v>

1146
00:52:59.930 --> 00:53:04.930
<v Speaker 4>What disturbs me is not just that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also this natural human tendency </v>

1147
00:53:05.391 --> 00:53:10.391
<v Speaker 4>that we seem to have where you have an </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea in your head and then that idea is </v>

1148
00:53:10.391 --> 00:53:14.261
<v Speaker 4>not just an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's your idea and you have to </v>

1149
00:53:14.261 --> 00:53:14.261
<v Speaker 4>defend that idea even if it's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>preposterous idea,</v>

1150
00:53:14.261 --> 00:53:15.370
<v Speaker 4>like the earth is flat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

1151
00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:20.540
<v Speaker 4>and what you find out is that these </v>
<v Speaker 4>people form groups and other people who </v>

1152
00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:24.611
<v Speaker 4>have also sort of adopted this </v>
<v Speaker 4>preposterous idea and refuse to look at </v>

1153
00:53:24.611 --> 00:53:25.820
<v Speaker 4>all at any evidence at pointed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's</v>

1154
00:53:26.050 --> 00:53:31.050
<v Speaker 2>a silly idea and instead they dig their </v>
<v Speaker 2>heels in and get confirmation bias from </v>

1155
00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:35.691
<v Speaker 2>all these other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they formed these social media </v>

1156
00:53:35.691 --> 00:53:35.691
<v Speaker 2>groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>facebook groups.</v>

1157
00:53:35.691 --> 00:53:40.340
<v Speaker 2>They go to websites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get on web forums and they start </v>

1158
00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:41.820
<v Speaker 2>interacting with each other and </v>
<v Speaker 2>exclusively interacted with each other.</v>

1159
00:53:41.850 --> 00:53:44.920
<v Speaker 2>And then also in forcing each other's </v>
<v Speaker 2>beliefs and,</v>

1160
00:53:44.921 --> 00:53:46.620
<v Speaker 2>and great job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1161
00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:49.140
<v Speaker 2>Good job of attacking those shells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1162
00:53:49.141 --> 00:53:50.550
<v Speaker 2>You know those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you.</v>

1163
00:53:50.551 --> 00:53:52.410
<v Speaker 2>Do you know if you think the earth is </v>
<v Speaker 2>round,</v>

1164
00:53:52.411 --> 00:53:55.320
<v Speaker 2>you are at globe hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the newest.</v>

1165
00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:58.620
<v Speaker 2>Jamie literally like cringed each took </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1166
00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:00.440
<v Speaker 2>He had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to like step back.</v>

1167
00:54:00.490 --> 00:54:01.980
<v Speaker 2>Blink his eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1168
00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:07.020
<v Speaker 2>You're a globe toward that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That whole thing is because these </v>

1169
00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:10.401
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone said something that someone </v>

1170
00:54:10.401 --> 00:54:10.401
<v Speaker 2>went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1171
00:54:10.401 --> 00:54:10.410
<v Speaker 2>people love to find the secrets they </v>
<v Speaker 2>love.</v>

1172
00:54:10.411 --> 00:54:15.411
<v Speaker 2>Like this dinosaur thing is cool because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be real and you see the gal </v>

1173
00:54:15.411 --> 00:54:19.221
<v Speaker 2>that said that all the fossils were </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically people doing like kind of </v>

1174
00:54:19.221 --> 00:54:23.691
<v Speaker 2>Michelangelo deal and Chiseling the </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter rock because the fossils came out</v>

1175
00:54:23.821 --> 00:54:24.630
<v Speaker 2>of rock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh you got you.</v>

1176
00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:28.120
<v Speaker 2>And she actually what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She hasn't pretty nice boobs too.</v>

1177
00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:32.370
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's why people are listening,</v>

1178
00:54:32.730 --> 00:54:35.760
<v Speaker 2>but just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a platform now you've got tits.</v>

1179
00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:39.520
<v Speaker 2>It's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1180
00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:41.430
<v Speaker 2>so she's basically like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1181
00:54:41.431 --> 00:54:44.700
<v Speaker 2>so these things come out of rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these anthropologists,</v>

1182
00:54:44.701 --> 00:54:49.290
<v Speaker 2>because there's millions of dollars in </v>
<v Speaker 2>anthropology or archeology there,</v>

1183
00:54:49.291 --> 00:54:53.670
<v Speaker 2>just chiseling these bones out of rock </v>
<v Speaker 2>and here we go to her</v>

1184
00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:58.390
<v Speaker 5>fossils that are found in the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's that?</v>

1185
00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:02.120
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to play games against </v>
<v Speaker 5>dinosaurs.</v>

1186
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:03.860
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't need to play some of us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1187
00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:07.210
<v Speaker 5>I'm a little bit about the composition </v>
<v Speaker 5>composition,</v>

1188
00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:10.300
<v Speaker 5>what they end up being when everything </v>
<v Speaker 5>is said and done.</v>

1189
00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:11.950
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1190
00:55:11.951 --> 00:55:16.951
<v Speaker 5>fossil fossil piece of bone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So is actually a bone that was once in </v>

1191
00:55:22.241 --> 00:55:27.241
<v Speaker 5>the ground that has been then filled </v>
<v Speaker 5>with limestone,</v>

1192
00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:33.420
<v Speaker 5>calcium and other kinds of stone link </v>
<v Speaker 5>deposits over the course of many,</v>

1193
00:55:33.971 --> 00:55:37.460
<v Speaker 5>many years left eyes out a patch of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>day that ends up looking like,</v>

1194
00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:42.140
<v Speaker 5>why is she doing that glass?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's your fucking hair out this big?</v>

1195
00:55:42.730 --> 00:55:43.380
<v Speaker 5>And you say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1196
00:55:45.250 --> 00:55:48.290
<v Speaker 5>there's a bunch of fossils go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

1197
00:55:48.790 --> 00:55:53.790
<v Speaker 5>can you hand the rock off?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Paleontologist paleontologist takes a </v>

1198
00:55:53.790 --> 00:55:57.001
<v Speaker 5>little malate and they chip away at it </v>
<v Speaker 5>and at some point they come out with </v>

1199
00:55:57.701 --> 00:56:00.880
<v Speaker 5>something looking like a bomb and this </v>
<v Speaker 5>is a problem.</v>

1200
00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:01.880
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the problem.</v>

1201
00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:04.670
<v Speaker 2>Just pause that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is some fucking idiot.</v>

1202
00:56:04.671 --> 00:56:08.900
<v Speaker 2>Like this gets to talk about a subject </v>
<v Speaker 2>that she's not educated in and no one is</v>

1203
00:56:08.901 --> 00:56:10.100
<v Speaker 2>over her shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got Eh,</v>

1204
00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:12.140
<v Speaker 2>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>

1205
00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:15.240
<v Speaker 2>And here's the thing to people that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1206
00:56:15.570 --> 00:56:18.770
<v Speaker 2>someone out there who buys into a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stupid shit,</v>

1207
00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:21.290
<v Speaker 2>you must be an expert in something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1208
00:56:21.291 --> 00:56:22.980
<v Speaker 2>think about what you do for a living.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1209
00:56:22.990 --> 00:56:24.040
<v Speaker 2>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's</v>

1210
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:29.040
<v Speaker 4>a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like some of someone tried to tell me </v>

1211
00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:29.140
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1212
00:56:29.170 --> 00:56:33.100
<v Speaker 4>a lot of these cheat touch martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys are two deadly to fight in the UFC.</v>

1213
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:37.180
<v Speaker 4>And if they make a video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they make a video about this and I'm not</v>

1214
00:56:37.181 --> 00:56:42.181
<v Speaker 4>there while they're making this video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I can't talk to them like in stop </v>

1215
00:56:42.181 --> 00:56:43.090
<v Speaker 4>them and pause them and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nope,</v>

1216
00:56:43.091 --> 00:56:43.990
<v Speaker 4>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nope,</v>

1217
00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:44.620
<v Speaker 4>that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nope,</v>

1218
00:56:44.650 --> 00:56:45.550
<v Speaker 4>that's not correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1219
00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:50.580
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's actually what happens when you </v>

1220
00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:50.580
<v Speaker 4>get knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1221
00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:52.510
<v Speaker 4>it is not a fucking cheat discretion or </v>
<v Speaker 4>dispersion technique.</v>

1222
00:56:52.511 --> 00:56:55.590
<v Speaker 4>You're not really interrupting the </v>
<v Speaker 4>shockers flow.</v>

1223
00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:56.950
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a fucking concussion.</v>

1224
00:56:56.951 --> 00:56:58.600
<v Speaker 4>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we can measure concussions.</v>

1225
00:56:58.601 --> 00:57:01.360
<v Speaker 4>We know about all the different </v>
<v Speaker 4>variables in the blood.</v>

1226
00:57:01.361 --> 00:57:06.361
<v Speaker 4>When you could prove it was actually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some new tests that I wanted to </v>

1227
00:57:06.361 --> 00:57:06.361
<v Speaker 4>get into as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1228
00:57:06.361 --> 00:57:06.970
<v Speaker 4>where they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1229
00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:11.200
<v Speaker 4>there's an institute now that's checking</v>
<v Speaker 4>concussions and they're checking,</v>

1230
00:57:11.650 --> 00:57:16.650
<v Speaker 4>they're doing blood tests on people to </v>
<v Speaker 4>find out about concussions that they've </v>

1231
00:57:16.650 --> 00:57:18.490
<v Speaker 4>had in the past and how those </v>
<v Speaker 4>concussions have healed.</v>

1232
00:57:19.570 --> 00:57:24.570
<v Speaker 4>Obviously I'm deviating from the path,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the point is I know a lot about </v>

1233
00:57:24.570 --> 00:57:28.411
<v Speaker 4>martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if someone wants to do a video about </v>

1234
00:57:28.411 --> 00:57:31.531
<v Speaker 4>martial arts while I'm an actual martial</v>
<v Speaker 4>arts expert and I can talk to you about </v>

1235
00:57:31.531 --> 00:57:31.810
<v Speaker 4>what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's incorrect.</v>

1236
00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:33.980
<v Speaker 4>I know about the history of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know what,</v>

1237
00:57:34.030 --> 00:57:37.750
<v Speaker 4>what works and why it works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know about Torque and leverage and all</v>

1238
00:57:37.751 --> 00:57:42.751
<v Speaker 4>these different variables,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you could make a video with without </v>

1239
00:57:42.751 --> 00:57:46.921
<v Speaker 4>me being there and you could ramble on </v>
<v Speaker 4>or not even me in any martial arts </v>

1240
00:57:46.921 --> 00:57:48.640
<v Speaker 4>expert and you could ramble on and if </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone doesn't know,</v>

1241
00:57:48.641 --> 00:57:50.320
<v Speaker 4>they watched and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

1242
00:57:50.530 --> 00:57:52.450
<v Speaker 4>that guy dropping some truth bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1243
00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:54.310
<v Speaker 4>This is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1244
00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:56.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you saw this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but Matt Thornton,</v>

1245
00:57:56.231 --> 00:57:59.110
<v Speaker 4>he's the founder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really brilliant guy,</v>

1246
00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:03.550
<v Speaker 4>and they put together this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forget who it was.</v>

1247
00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:08.580
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of a philosophy department and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they put together this kind of white </v>

1248
00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:11.851
<v Speaker 4>sheet on using Brazilian Jujitsu in </v>
<v Speaker 4>particular as a means of teaching </v>

1249
00:58:11.851 --> 00:58:16.621
<v Speaker 4>critical thinking to students because </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this really testable,</v>

1250
00:58:17.981 --> 00:58:21.100
<v Speaker 4>verifiable process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does it work or does it not work?</v>

1251
00:58:21.101 --> 00:58:24.370
<v Speaker 4>And you can define what working means </v>
<v Speaker 4>versus this kind of like,</v>

1252
00:58:24.371 --> 00:58:24.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cheat,</v>

1253
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:30.000
<v Speaker 4>didn't lock death touch type type stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they've actually developed this </v>

1254
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.860
<v Speaker 4>curriculum around using this physical </v>
<v Speaker 4>process of Brazilian Jujitsu and I think</v>

1255
00:58:32.861 --> 00:58:37.861
<v Speaker 4>also mixed martial arts in general,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but specifically Jujitsu as a means of </v>

1256
00:58:37.861 --> 00:58:40.000
<v Speaker 4>teaching critical thinking skills and </v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

1257
00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:46.140
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll noodle on what like Kinda like the </v>

1258
00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:47.110
<v Speaker 4>search terms for would be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's really interesting and it,</v>

1259
00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:52.120
<v Speaker 4>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's something that I think helps pull </v>

1260
00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:53.710
<v Speaker 4>this stuff together because you've got </v>
<v Speaker 4>that kinesthetic element of people being</v>

1261
00:58:53.711 --> 00:58:55.060
<v Speaker 4>able to feel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1262
00:58:55.061 --> 00:58:56.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody gets mounted onto you,</v>

1263
00:58:56.410 --> 00:58:57.460
<v Speaker 4>can you get them off?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1264
00:58:57.461 --> 00:58:59.620
<v Speaker 4>we'll look at this 100,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 pound chick.</v>

1265
00:58:59.621 --> 00:59:04.621
<v Speaker 4>She can dismount this person conditions </v>
<v Speaker 4>using these techniques of leverage and </v>

1266
00:59:04.621 --> 00:59:08.491
<v Speaker 4>balance and timing and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so then you can throw these things </v>

1267
00:59:08.491 --> 00:59:11.110
<v Speaker 4>out about is this a verifiable process,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes or no?</v>

1268
00:59:11.111 --> 00:59:16.111
<v Speaker 4>And it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so then you start laying the </v>

1269
00:59:16.111 --> 00:59:17.860
<v Speaker 4>foundation of being able to create a </v>
<v Speaker 4>good critical thinking process.</v>

1270
00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that I really love </v>
<v Speaker 4>about Brazilian Jujitsu in particular is</v>

1271
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:25.490
<v Speaker 2>that it seems to be a study in variable </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutes,</v>

1272
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:31.000
<v Speaker 2>meaning that there's so many variables </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in like two people engaging </v>

1273
00:59:31.371 --> 00:59:33.920
<v Speaker 2>with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say if two people are blue belts and the</v>

1274
00:59:33.921 --> 00:59:38.921
<v Speaker 2>engage with each other and one person </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominates that person with superior </v>

1275
00:59:38.921 --> 00:59:40.940
<v Speaker 2>technique and knowledge and gets the tap</v>
<v Speaker 2>over and over again.</v>

1276
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:46.270
<v Speaker 2>You could take that same person who </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominated that person and then put him </v>

1277
00:59:46.270 --> 00:59:50.471
<v Speaker 2>in there with a guy leg Jacques Ra and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he would just get manhandled and it </v>

1278
00:59:50.471 --> 00:59:55.211
<v Speaker 2>would look like he knows virtually </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing about Jujitsu because some one </v>

1279
00:59:55.211 --> 00:59:59.450
<v Speaker 2>person's the variables,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the understanding of all the </v>

1280
00:59:59.450 --> 01:00:03.311
<v Speaker 2>complexities of the techniques they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>mastered them and they have also built </v>

1281
01:00:03.311 --> 01:00:06.650
<v Speaker 2>their body to a much stronger physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>unit.</v>

1282
01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:10.310
<v Speaker 2>So all these are variables,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the absolute is getting the arm bar,</v>

1283
01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:12.740
<v Speaker 2>getting the choke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting someone to sleep with a choke,</v>

1284
01:00:12.830 --> 01:00:14.050
<v Speaker 2>like those things are absolute.</v>

1285
01:00:14.050 --> 01:00:19.050
<v Speaker 2>It's like where you tap out if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not just like a person who gets scared </v>

1286
01:00:20.271 --> 01:00:22.310
<v Speaker 2>really quick and taps out for no reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>which does happen,</v>

1287
01:00:22.311 --> 01:00:24.080
<v Speaker 2>but you're thinking about someone who </v>
<v Speaker 2>has some experience.</v>

1288
01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:26.000
<v Speaker 2>When you're tapping out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're essentially saying,</v>

1289
01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:28.790
<v Speaker 2>you've got me into this absolute </v>
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>

1290
01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:29.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1291
01:00:29.730 --> 01:00:32.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm at the point of death or massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>injury.</v>

1292
01:00:33.110 --> 01:00:34.940
<v Speaker 2>Knees tearing apart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>arms breaking.</v>

1293
01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:40.420
<v Speaker 2>So in doing those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you encounter these variable absolutes </v>

1294
01:00:40.701 --> 01:00:43.940
<v Speaker 2>in a way that is really kind of uncommon</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our world,</v>

1295
01:00:43.941 --> 01:00:46.940
<v Speaker 2>outside of fucking car accidents and </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone hitting you over the head with a</v>

1296
01:00:46.941 --> 01:00:48.490
<v Speaker 2>baseball bat and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1297
01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:53.580
<v Speaker 2>you will encounter the consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 2>actions and movements in a way that sort</v>

1298
01:00:54.021 --> 01:00:59.021
<v Speaker 2>of makes you really appreciate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>overall variables of life and how </v>

1299
01:00:59.151 --> 01:01:01.310
<v Speaker 2>important it is to take care of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>health.</v>

1300
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:03.920
<v Speaker 2>How important it is to know what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

1301
01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:04.550
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1302
01:01:04.690 --> 01:01:09.690
<v Speaker 2>if fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to talk about fighting is </v>

1303
01:01:09.690 --> 01:01:10.700
<v Speaker 2>if it's a language and if one person has</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one word,</v>

1304
01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:13.040
<v Speaker 2>they yell at you and they're like really</v>
<v Speaker 2>good at going,</v>

1305
01:01:13.041 --> 01:01:16.250
<v Speaker 2>shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like one expression like that might work</v>

1306
01:01:16.251 --> 01:01:21.251
<v Speaker 2>with some people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not gonna work with someone who's </v>

1307
01:01:21.251 --> 01:01:21.251
<v Speaker 2>got a really good grasp of the English </v>
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>

1308
01:01:21.251 --> 01:01:21.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh I should shut the fuck up and wash </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1309
01:01:21.741 --> 01:01:23.210
<v Speaker 2>I shut the fuck up because you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1310
01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:28.420
<v Speaker 2>Why would you like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you're too stupid to have a </v>

1311
01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:30.011
<v Speaker 2>conversation about something you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know you're talking about and that </v>

1312
01:01:30.011 --> 01:01:30.011
<v Speaker 2>person's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1313
01:01:30.011 --> 01:01:33.210
<v Speaker 2>it's really like drowning in which is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same way you'd feel of Damien Maia </v>

1314
01:01:33.210 --> 01:01:35.120
<v Speaker 2>was on top of you trying to choke you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot like a language,</v>

1315
01:01:35.121 --> 01:01:40.121
<v Speaker 2>like you don't have enough variables to </v>
<v Speaker 2>respond to this particular thing and </v>

1316
01:01:40.121 --> 01:01:41.360
<v Speaker 2>then there's also the strength factor </v>
<v Speaker 2>and those other factors.</v>

1317
01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:46.660
<v Speaker 2>I think it teaches you critical thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way that is almost unavailable </v>

1318
01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:51.890
<v Speaker 2>outside of like war and like real </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical trauma.</v>

1319
01:01:52.310 --> 01:01:55.820
<v Speaker 2>Because the beautiful thing about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu is although you can get injured,</v>

1320
01:01:56.570 --> 01:01:58.700
<v Speaker 2>most of it is pretty safe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1321
01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.410
<v Speaker 2>Compared to boxing or kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1322
01:02:00.411 --> 01:02:04.550
<v Speaker 2>You've got a much more forgivable kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of margin of error on that.</v>

1323
01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:09.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Much more and I think the environment </v>

1324
01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:12.431
<v Speaker 2>that it establishes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it creates and the way that effect </v>

1325
01:02:12.431 --> 01:02:16.211
<v Speaker 2>that it has on your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's forcing you into these extreme </v>

1326
01:02:16.211 --> 01:02:17.570
<v Speaker 2>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>situations and solving those problems.</v>

1327
01:02:17.571 --> 01:02:22.571
<v Speaker 2>Then understanding where that go wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can I do to my body to maybe </v>

1328
01:02:22.571 --> 01:02:27.291
<v Speaker 2>strengthen myself so that I can stop </v>
<v Speaker 2>that from happening or maybe understand </v>

1329
01:02:27.811 --> 01:02:29.670
<v Speaker 2>the position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So two steps ahead.</v>

1330
01:02:29.671 --> 01:02:32.970
<v Speaker 2>I recognize that if I go left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I run into that and if I go right,</v>

1331
01:02:32.971 --> 01:02:35.220
<v Speaker 2>I run into this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I need to do is be patient,</v>

1332
01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:36.750
<v Speaker 2>use my hips,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hip escape,</v>

1333
01:02:36.751 --> 01:02:37.530
<v Speaker 2>do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>

1334
01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:42.860
<v Speaker 2>And those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those variables and understanding those </v>

1335
01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:45.741
<v Speaker 2>variables and having that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that database in your mind and </v>

1336
01:02:45.741 --> 01:02:47.050
<v Speaker 2>recognizing that that is also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's there's,</v>

1337
01:02:47.070 --> 01:02:52.070
<v Speaker 2>there's analogies that you could make in</v>
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of avenues in life that were,</v>

1338
01:02:52.471 --> 01:02:55.020
<v Speaker 2>that would be greatly beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1339
01:02:55.021 --> 01:02:56.350
<v Speaker 2>it and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1340
01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:01.400
<v Speaker 2>just another hat tip to Matt Thornton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he's just made this point that </v>

1341
01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:01.400
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1342
01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:03.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alive art,</v>

1343
01:03:03.570 --> 01:03:06.060
<v Speaker 2>whether it's wrestling or boxing or Thai</v>
<v Speaker 2>boxing,</v>

1344
01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:07.500
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>judo,</v>

1345
01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:12.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's kind of an authenticity with </v>

1346
01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:13.730
<v Speaker 2>that because you really can't bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like,</v>

1347
01:03:13.830 --> 01:03:15.300
<v Speaker 2>can you speak Spanish?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1348
01:03:15.301 --> 01:03:20.301
<v Speaker 2>well let's have a conversation in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Spanish reading Spanish newspaper and </v>

1349
01:03:20.301 --> 01:03:21.270
<v Speaker 2>tell me what was going on with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you swim?</v>

1350
01:03:21.271 --> 01:03:22.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris,</v>

1351
01:03:22.231 --> 01:03:24.540
<v Speaker 2>I think he wrote that piece,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1352
01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:28.260
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu was like drowning for a non,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a non swimmer,</v>

1353
01:03:28.261 --> 01:03:33.261
<v Speaker 2>looking at someone treading water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks inconsequential and you throw </v>

1354
01:03:33.261 --> 01:03:33.261
<v Speaker 2>them in the water and they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>

1355
01:03:33.261 --> 01:03:38.050
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a real authenticity there</v>
<v Speaker 2>that when you get in and do that </v>

1356
01:03:38.050 --> 01:03:42.770
<v Speaker 2>compared to some of the fantasy martial </v>
<v Speaker 2>arts where there is an assumption that </v>

1357
01:03:42.770 --> 01:03:47.451
<v Speaker 2>just going through some sort of paces is</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get you somewhere and it </v>

1358
01:03:47.451 --> 01:03:47.451
<v Speaker 2>doesn't necessarily mean that it does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1359
01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:52.490
<v Speaker 2>And so there's this whole great feedback</v>
<v Speaker 2>loop and it crushes your ego and you </v>

1360
01:03:53.221 --> 01:03:56.760
<v Speaker 2>have to really stay grounded if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna maintain through that process,</v>

1361
01:03:56.761 --> 01:04:00.780
<v Speaker 2>but it has so much value with every </v>
<v Speaker 2>other facet of your life.</v>

1362
01:04:00.781 --> 01:04:01.890
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fascinating.</v>

1363
01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:03.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can keep from being injured,</v>

1364
01:04:03.930 --> 01:04:04.590
<v Speaker 2>if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1365
01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:09.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think one of the things that </v>

1366
01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:11.331
<v Speaker 2>really helped to keep from being injured</v>
<v Speaker 2>is I think it's very critical to </v>

1367
01:04:11.331 --> 01:04:14.871
<v Speaker 2>strengthen the body and I think there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people that don't like to do </v>

1368
01:04:14.871 --> 01:04:14.871
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just like to train.</v>

1369
01:04:14.871 --> 01:04:19.730
<v Speaker 2>And I was guilty of that for quite a </v>
<v Speaker 2>while until I just mounted up a series </v>

1370
01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:20.430
<v Speaker 2>of injuries that I almost couldn't deny </v>
<v Speaker 2>it anymore,</v>

1371
01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:22.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly back injuries,</v>

1372
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:27.710
<v Speaker 2>but strengthening the body and sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>strengthening the overall structure in </v>

1373
01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:30.060
<v Speaker 2>which you engage in these sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1374
01:04:30.270 --> 01:04:35.270
<v Speaker 2>Meaning not just strengthening the body </v>
<v Speaker 2>will by lifting weights and doing </v>

1375
01:04:35.270 --> 01:04:38.241
<v Speaker 2>squats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also by yoga also by doing really </v>

1376
01:04:38.241 --> 01:04:41.190
<v Speaker 2>unusual exercise like kettlebell </v>
<v Speaker 2>windmills and stuff like that.</v>

1377
01:04:41.191 --> 01:04:45.570
<v Speaker 2>That really puts a very bizarre load on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the spine and weird ways.</v>

1378
01:04:45.571 --> 01:04:50.571
<v Speaker 2>And it's really strengthens the core in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a substantial manner that allows you to </v>

1379
01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:54.630
<v Speaker 2>deal with the pressure of certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>positions without succumbing to the,</v>

1380
01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:55.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1381
01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:57.480
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the attempt by your opponent.</v>

1382
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:58.260
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1383
01:04:58.261 --> 01:05:03.261
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting topic because you </v>

1384
01:05:03.261 --> 01:05:03.261
<v Speaker 2>have someone like Marcello Garcia that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

1385
01:05:03.261 --> 01:05:06.430
<v Speaker 2>I just roll and clearly that word is </v>
<v Speaker 2>injured now.</v>

1386
01:05:07.390 --> 01:05:09.210
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's definitely,</v>

1387
01:05:09.211 --> 01:05:10.560
<v Speaker 2>you can just roll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1388
01:05:10.590 --> 01:05:12.570
<v Speaker 2>You definitely can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're as until you can't.</v>

1389
01:05:12.571 --> 01:05:14.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's technical as him.</v>

1390
01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:17.800
<v Speaker 2>He also has weird genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you look at Marcello's body,</v>

1391
01:05:17.801 --> 01:05:20.230
<v Speaker 2>his legs look like a man who weighs 300 </v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds.</v>

1392
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:22.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean he has cankles slack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1393
01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:24.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shannon cafs giant legs.</v>

1394
01:05:24.971 --> 01:05:29.971
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the reasons why he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>so good at controlling the back is he's </v>

1395
01:05:29.971 --> 01:05:31.570
<v Speaker 2>using his legs and smashing you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huge legs.</v>

1396
01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:36.630
<v Speaker 2>Well let me ask you about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I've been a big fan again of kind </v>

1397
01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:37.520
<v Speaker 2>of this straight blast gym stuff of you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1398
01:05:37.530 --> 01:05:41.500
<v Speaker 2>like non attribute based training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how do you break that up?</v>

1399
01:05:41.501 --> 01:05:44.230
<v Speaker 2>So like if you were flexible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are your explosive or,</v>

1400
01:05:44.231 --> 01:05:49.231
<v Speaker 2>or what have you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much of that do you rely on versus </v>

1401
01:05:49.231 --> 01:05:51.550
<v Speaker 2>trying to develop this stuff where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got a game that you could do,</v>

1402
01:05:51.551 --> 01:05:53.830
<v Speaker 2>whether you're 40 years old or 80 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>old,</v>

1403
01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:56.680
<v Speaker 2>like how do you play back and forth with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that to to,</v>

1404
01:05:56.770 --> 01:05:58.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>optimize that process?</v>

1405
01:05:58.210 --> 01:06:02.140
<v Speaker 2>A real good question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think a good study is Roy Jones Jr</v>

1406
01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:07.470
<v Speaker 2>and Roy Jones Jr in his prime was </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably the most attribute based </v>

1407
01:06:07.470 --> 01:06:10.360
<v Speaker 2>fighter of all time with substantial </v>
<v Speaker 2>attributes.</v>

1408
01:06:10.361 --> 01:06:15.361
<v Speaker 2>His speed and his style though the </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement in which he used inside the </v>

1409
01:06:15.361 --> 01:06:18.280
<v Speaker 2>ring was really very difficult for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to handle,</v>

1410
01:06:18.610 --> 01:06:23.350
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as that went away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his physical attributes sorta started to</v>

1411
01:06:23.351 --> 01:06:27.130
<v Speaker 2>deteriorate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His career declined substantially.</v>

1412
01:06:27.370 --> 01:06:29.420
<v Speaker 2>He went from being the best in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1413
01:06:29.490 --> 01:06:34.490
<v Speaker 2>Two years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people wanted him to retire and he went </v>

1414
01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:37.030
<v Speaker 2>from and there's a bunch of variables </v>
<v Speaker 2>that could have happened in that fact.</v>

1415
01:06:37.570 --> 01:06:40.770
<v Speaker 2>I think some manipulation of hormones we</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1416
01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:45.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm just speculating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I believe steroids are probably </v>

1417
01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:48.030
<v Speaker 2>involved in him moving up from light </v>
<v Speaker 2>heavyweight to heavyweight or a beat </v>

1418
01:06:48.030 --> 01:06:51.991
<v Speaker 2>John Ruiz for the heavyweight title and </v>
<v Speaker 2>was jacked at 200 pounds shredded and </v>

1419
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:57.870
<v Speaker 2>then went down and fought Antonio Tarver</v>
<v Speaker 2>and looked listless and soft and didn't </v>

1420
01:06:58.001 --> 01:07:03.001
<v Speaker 2>look as fast and I think a lot of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was his body responding to the fact that</v>

1421
01:07:03.491 --> 01:07:05.290
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his hormone levels were off.</v>

1422
01:07:05.290 --> 01:07:07.030
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know if he was checking that</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

1423
01:07:07.031 --> 01:07:12.031
<v Speaker 2>but I bet he probably wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet he just had lost too much weight </v>

1424
01:07:12.031 --> 01:07:15.811
<v Speaker 2>and dehydrated himself too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getting down to that 175 pound limit </v>

1425
01:07:15.811 --> 01:07:16.840
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So tarver knocked him out and then Glenn</v>

1426
01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:18.760
<v Speaker 2>Johnson knocked him out after the fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was bad.</v>

1427
01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:20.440
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

1428
01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:22.840
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Roy was in his prime though,</v>

1429
01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:27.310
<v Speaker 2>he did some things that were so hard to </v>
<v Speaker 2>handle,</v>

1430
01:07:27.311 --> 01:07:29.830
<v Speaker 2>so unconventional because of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous speed.</v>

1431
01:07:29.831 --> 01:07:32.980
<v Speaker 2>Like very rarely did he throw the jab </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead,</v>

1432
01:07:32.981 --> 01:07:37.120
<v Speaker 2>he would throw a lead hook and we throw </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lead hook and it was as fast as a jab,</v>

1433
01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:39.180
<v Speaker 2>but it would knock people to fuck out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1434
01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:40.060
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would just,</v>

1435
01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:45.180
<v Speaker 2>he would just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just good leap in on your plot and you </v>

1436
01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:45.730
<v Speaker 2>see guys get hit and then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right hand would be behind it.</v>

1437
01:07:46.030 --> 01:07:49.480
<v Speaker 2>He was so fucking fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when he was young,</v>

1438
01:07:49.810 --> 01:07:54.640
<v Speaker 2>he beat Bernard Hopkins and he beat him </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty handily when he was older.</v>

1439
01:07:54.641 --> 01:07:57.880
<v Speaker 2>Bernard Hopkins beat him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beat him pretty handily,</v>

1440
01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.730
<v Speaker 2>and Bernard Hopkins was always older </v>
<v Speaker 2>than him.</v>

1441
01:08:01.030 --> 01:08:06.030
<v Speaker 2>So when he was young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bernard Hopkins who had that very </v>

1442
01:08:06.030 --> 01:08:08.020
<v Speaker 2>defensive based style,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keeps his hands up very high,</v>

1443
01:08:08.021 --> 01:08:13.021
<v Speaker 2>very technical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't deal with the speed of Roy </v>

1444
01:08:13.021 --> 01:08:13.021
<v Speaker 2>Jones Jr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just was ridiculous.</v>

1445
01:08:13.021 --> 01:08:14.800
<v Speaker 2>But as soon as roy lost a step and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>speed,</v>

1446
01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:18.620
<v Speaker 2>tHen his style's not really the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>style.</v>

1447
01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:22.130
<v Speaker 2>The best style is the most technical </v>
<v Speaker 2>style.</v>

1448
01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:27.440
<v Speaker 2>And you can do that most technical style</v>
<v Speaker 2>with extreme attributes,</v>

1449
01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:30.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would agree with them that the best</v>

1450
01:08:30.141 --> 01:08:35.141
<v Speaker 2>thing to learn is the proper way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning all the techniques like </v>

1451
01:08:35.141 --> 01:08:36.320
<v Speaker 2>learning good defensive posture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>

1452
01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:38.960
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hands up when you're throwing strikes,</v>

1453
01:08:39.170 --> 01:08:43.160
<v Speaker 2>good movement and footwork and not just </v>
<v Speaker 2>relying on freak athleticism.</v>

1454
01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:46.310
<v Speaker 2>Think it's probably the best way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>attack it.</v>

1455
01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:48.770
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about the really grip </v>
<v Speaker 2>dependent games?</v>

1456
01:08:48.771 --> 01:08:51.170
<v Speaker 2>You know like all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the spider guard and all that stuff.</v>

1457
01:08:51.171 --> 01:08:56.171
<v Speaker 2>Like I see these guys doing really </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing stuff but it seems like their </v>

1458
01:08:56.171 --> 01:08:59.771
<v Speaker 2>hands are broken and it pretty young age</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mean maybe that's something that </v>

1459
01:08:59.871 --> 01:09:04.871
<v Speaker 2>you burn just to because you've got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>competitive career and then you've got </v>

1460
01:09:04.871 --> 01:09:06.530
<v Speaker 2>to kind of shift games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you have someone like crohn who</v>

1461
01:09:06.531 --> 01:09:08.690
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has an interesting,</v>

1462
01:09:08.691 --> 01:09:13.691
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>open guard game where it's a lot of </v>

1463
01:09:13.691 --> 01:09:15.491
<v Speaker 2>color control and stuff like that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not getting in and doing like </v>

1464
01:09:15.491 --> 01:09:18.941
<v Speaker 2>spider garden inversions and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you could argue is mayBe not as </v>

1465
01:09:18.941 --> 01:09:20.600
<v Speaker 2>successful as a lot of other people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1466
01:09:20.710 --> 01:09:25.710
<v Speaker 2>That really competitive circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he also seems to be motoring along </v>

1467
01:09:25.710 --> 01:09:25.710
<v Speaker 2>pretty well.</v>

1468
01:09:25.710 --> 01:09:28.190
<v Speaker 2>Reasonably injuRy free and still has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very powerful game.</v>

1469
01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:31.640
<v Speaker 2>Well he is an incredibly powerful game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You also have to think,</v>

1470
01:09:31.641 --> 01:09:33.970
<v Speaker 2>well his dad is the greatest jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 2>player time,</v>

1471
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:38.990
<v Speaker 2>so that had to play a factor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although it didn't really train much </v>

1472
01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:39.080
<v Speaker 2>with his dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of unusual.</v>

1473
01:09:39.530 --> 01:09:41.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have the,</v>

1474
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:45.770
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't his dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I say the basics,</v>

1475
01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:48.350
<v Speaker 2>what I mean the basics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean like it's a simple game.</v>

1476
01:09:48.351 --> 01:09:53.351
<v Speaker 2>His game very complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't do any weird sorta della </v>

1477
01:09:54.530 --> 01:09:59.530
<v Speaker 2>hiva stuff or weird spider guard stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like his game is basically the same kind</v>

1478
01:10:00.081 --> 01:10:03.650
<v Speaker 2>of jujitsu used to see in 1994 when </v>
<v Speaker 2>hickson was the king.</v>

1479
01:10:04.130 --> 01:10:09.130
<v Speaker 2>But it's not it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just super tuned in and high level </v>

1480
01:10:09.130 --> 01:10:13.841
<v Speaker 2>and razor sharp like his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of his best submissions is the good </v>

1481
01:10:13.841 --> 01:10:15.020
<v Speaker 2>team has another best submissions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a rear naked choke.</v>

1482
01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:17.930
<v Speaker 2>And if he gets you in those positions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're foxville right.</v>

1483
01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:22.950
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's really just that his technique </v>

1484
01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:25.661
<v Speaker 2>is so fucking sharp and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's levels to that sharpness of </v>

1485
01:10:25.661 --> 01:10:25.661
<v Speaker 2>technique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1486
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:30.080
<v Speaker 2>there's some guys that just have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>technique that is so god damn sharp,</v>

1487
01:10:30.081 --> 01:10:33.200
<v Speaker 2>it's impossible to avoid like on a level</v>
<v Speaker 2>lower level,</v>

1488
01:10:33.201 --> 01:10:38.201
<v Speaker 2>but there was a guy named paul sas used </v>
<v Speaker 2>to compete in the ufc who's to fucking </v>

1489
01:10:38.201 --> 01:10:41.891
<v Speaker 2>triangle everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants something like nine or 10 </v>

1490
01:10:41.891 --> 01:10:41.891
<v Speaker 2>matches by triangles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ridiculous.</v>

1491
01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:44.510
<v Speaker 2>He just would pull guard and then you'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>be fucked.</v>

1492
01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:47.960
<v Speaker 2>He would just figure out a way to wrap </v>
<v Speaker 2>your neck and arm around his legs,</v>

1493
01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:53.140
<v Speaker 2>squeeze the shit out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And next thing you know you're tapping </v>

1494
01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:53.140
<v Speaker 2>or blacked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1495
01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:56.560
<v Speaker 2>And people knew what he would do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They knew that that was his game and </v>

1496
01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:56.560
<v Speaker 2>they would still get caught in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>triangle.</v>

1497
01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:57.650
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

1498
01:10:57.710 --> 01:11:02.710
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because his technique was so razor </v>

1499
01:11:02.710 --> 01:11:03.020
<v Speaker 2>sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

1500
01:11:03.170 --> 01:11:08.170
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of people that get</v>
<v Speaker 2>caught up in those grabbing a games,</v>

1501
01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:10.850
<v Speaker 2>those grip dependent games and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1502
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:11.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would go,</v>

1503
01:11:11.691 --> 01:11:13.320
<v Speaker 2>well let me try it on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll fuck you up wiTh it.</v>

1504
01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:14.880
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they would fuck me up with it.</v>

1505
01:11:15.150 --> 01:11:20.150
<v Speaker 2>But I honestly believed that the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>jujitsu is jujitsu that you can do with </v>

1506
01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:25.780
<v Speaker 2>ge or without a [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of those guys where they get </v>

1507
01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:27.510
<v Speaker 2>into mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have any handles to grab,</v>

1508
01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:32.800
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So nogi jujitsu is much more like greco </v>

1509
01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:36.321
<v Speaker 2>roman wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas eddie bravo and his 10th planet </v>

1510
01:11:36.321 --> 01:11:39.801
<v Speaker 2>jiu jitsu system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he's done a sort of incorporate </v>

1511
01:11:39.801 --> 01:11:39.801
<v Speaker 2>much more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1512
01:11:40.170 --> 01:11:43.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like greco roman control.</v>

1513
01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:44.720
<v Speaker 2>And you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I,</v>

1514
01:11:44.721 --> 01:11:47.430
<v Speaker 2>I still roll with the gang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I do [inaudible] jujitsu,</v>

1515
01:11:47.431 --> 01:11:49.220
<v Speaker 2>I very rarely grabbed the gay.</v>

1516
01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:51.990
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything I'm doing is like under hooks</v>

1517
01:11:52.050 --> 01:11:57.050
<v Speaker 2>over hooks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting gAble grips and I'm using </v>

1518
01:11:57.050 --> 01:11:58.710
<v Speaker 2>nogi techniques with agi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for me,</v>

1519
01:11:58.711 --> 01:12:02.130
<v Speaker 2>what I like about the ge is defensively </v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't fuck around,</v>

1520
01:12:02.230 --> 01:12:07.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I can't just yank out of arm bars </v>

1521
01:12:07.230 --> 01:12:09.351
<v Speaker 2>and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're in there with a good guy </v>

1522
01:12:09.351 --> 01:12:11.151
<v Speaker 2>and he's got you in his garden is a key.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much friction that you have </v>

1523
01:12:11.151 --> 01:12:14.721
<v Speaker 2>to really be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think offensively you have to be </v>

1524
01:12:14.721 --> 01:12:15.460
<v Speaker 2>very careful to not use that key.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1525
01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:19.350
<v Speaker 2>But the good thing about learning how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>use the g,</v>

1526
01:12:19.351 --> 01:12:24.351
<v Speaker 2>it's like say if you get in a fight with</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone and they have a winter coat on </v>

1527
01:12:24.351 --> 01:12:24.351
<v Speaker 2>their fucking dead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1528
01:12:24.351 --> 01:12:24.840
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some guy wants some drunk,</v>

1529
01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:28.380
<v Speaker 2>wants to kick your ass and you just get </v>
<v Speaker 2>your hand inside his collar and like,</v>

1530
01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:29.190
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at you,</v>

1531
01:12:29.191 --> 01:12:30.560
<v Speaker 2>you're a dead man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1532
01:12:30.570 --> 01:12:31.090
<v Speaker 2>you're dead.</v>

1533
01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:36.680
<v Speaker 2>Like if you get a guy who's like got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good ezekiel choke or something like </v>

1534
01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:36.680
<v Speaker 2>that and he gets a hold of you and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>on top of you.</v>

1535
01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:38.970
<v Speaker 2>And he gets his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his own color and wraps around,</v>

1536
01:12:38.971 --> 01:12:41.300
<v Speaker 2>chokes you to death with his own arms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1537
01:12:41.310 --> 01:12:41.700
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1538
01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:43.160
<v Speaker 2>that's good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1539
01:12:43.161 --> 01:12:44.850
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like judo player,</v>

1540
01:12:45.150 --> 01:12:48.420
<v Speaker 2>like if someone like jimmy pedro gets a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hold of your leather jacket,</v>

1541
01:12:48.450 --> 01:12:53.450
<v Speaker 2>you're fucked man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna hit you with the world </v>

1542
01:12:53.450 --> 01:12:57.560
<v Speaker 2>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when someone's throwing you in the </v>

1543
01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:57.560
<v Speaker 2>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a real world class,</v>

1544
01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:59.520
<v Speaker 2>judoka hitting you in the head with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

1545
01:12:59.670 --> 01:13:01.800
<v Speaker 2>they're going to throw you on your head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to go unconscious.</v>

1546
01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:03.760
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you guys had henry akin on?</v>

1547
01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:04.740
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't.</v>

1548
01:13:04.770 --> 01:13:06.010
<v Speaker 2>Henry's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1549
01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:08.460
<v Speaker 2>Such a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a black belt under hixon as well.</v>

1550
01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:09.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know henry very well.</v>

1551
01:13:10.110 --> 01:13:10.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1552
01:13:10.510 --> 01:13:11.330
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1553
01:13:11.370 --> 01:13:12.930
<v Speaker 2>hickson's black belts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1554
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:14.610
<v Speaker 2>there's certain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like a.</v>

1555
01:13:14.730 --> 01:13:16.560
<v Speaker 2>There's a few black belts like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1556
01:13:16.561 --> 01:13:19.200
<v Speaker 2>You've got a henzel gracie black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking legit.</v>

1557
01:13:19.230 --> 01:13:24.230
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a few of those like that in </v>

1558
01:13:24.230 --> 01:13:24.230
<v Speaker 2>hixson is one of the most legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>

1559
01:13:24.230 --> 01:13:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Henry is just a great guy in his game is</v>

1560
01:13:25.211 --> 01:13:30.211
<v Speaker 1>really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the g and the nogi game are </v>

1561
01:13:30.211 --> 01:13:32.401
<v Speaker 1>virtually identical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you do a little stuff for the </v>

1562
01:13:32.401 --> 01:13:33.360
<v Speaker 1>color jokes and whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but otherwise it's,</v>

1563
01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:37.380
<v Speaker 1>it's just completely uniform from geeta </v>
<v Speaker 1>nogi and so it's,</v>

1564
01:13:37.381 --> 01:13:42.381
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting for me to being 45 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to motor through this stuff and </v>

1565
01:13:42.381 --> 01:13:46.981
<v Speaker 1>I'm really not that bright of a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I need transferable job </v>

1566
01:13:46.981 --> 01:13:49.921
<v Speaker 1>skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I want to learn something once and </v>

1567
01:13:49.921 --> 01:13:51.460
<v Speaker 1>not need a million nuances for things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A dummies right now or listening to this</v>

1568
01:13:51.461 --> 01:13:52.330
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not bright.</v>

1569
01:13:52.331 --> 01:13:55.060
<v Speaker 1>What am I fucking champ?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

1570
01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:57.040
<v Speaker 1>He's not brIght.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

1571
01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:59.740
<v Speaker 1>Could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could be now a,</v>

1572
01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:03.220
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing to regulate your </v>
<v Speaker 1>hormones or check your hormones?</v>

1573
01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:06.340
<v Speaker 1>I checked them about yearly and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1574
01:14:06.341 --> 01:14:10.180
<v Speaker 1>the main deal with that is just keeping </v>
<v Speaker 1>a really good eye on my sleep,</v>

1575
01:14:10.210 --> 01:14:11.830
<v Speaker 1>my nutrition recovery.</v>

1576
01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:16.480
<v Speaker 1>I do some hrv monitoring and the heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>rate variability,</v>

1577
01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:20.980
<v Speaker 1>so you check that in the morning and </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically hrv was studied,</v>

1578
01:14:20.981 --> 01:14:24.400
<v Speaker 1>developed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered by the eastern bloc countries</v>

1579
01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:29.460
<v Speaker 1>and it was part of the space program and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's looking at the total alice static </v>

1580
01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:31.360
<v Speaker 1>load or the stress load on an </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

1581
01:14:31.361 --> 01:14:34.960
<v Speaker 1>So the heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have 60 beats a minute,</v>

1582
01:14:34.961 --> 01:14:38.110
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't necessarily mean that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>beating once a second.</v>

1583
01:14:38.530 --> 01:14:43.530
<v Speaker 1>You may have three beats that go really </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast and then there may be a long pause </v>

1584
01:14:43.530 --> 01:14:45.640
<v Speaker 1>and then two beats and so there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>variability to.</v>

1585
01:14:45.641 --> 01:14:49.270
<v Speaker 1>And it's basically chaos mathematics </v>
<v Speaker 1>that describes this stuff,</v>

1586
01:14:49.271 --> 01:14:52.600
<v Speaker 1>but if you are not under significant </v>
<v Speaker 1>stress,</v>

1587
01:14:52.601 --> 01:14:57.601
<v Speaker 1>if your parasympathetic nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest and restore part is kind of </v>

1588
01:14:57.601 --> 01:15:00.070
<v Speaker 1>brought to the fore like breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meditation,</v>

1589
01:15:00.071 --> 01:15:01.330
<v Speaker 1>yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of stuff.</v>

1590
01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:05.050
<v Speaker 1>Then you tended to have more heart rate </v>
<v Speaker 1>variability and that's a good thing.</v>

1591
01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:10.440
<v Speaker 1>when you get under stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you tend to have less heart rate </v>

1592
01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:13.771
<v Speaker 1>variability and becomes more metronomic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I've found that if I keep an eye on </v>

1593
01:15:13.771 --> 01:15:18.151
<v Speaker 1>my heart rate variability in conjunction</v>
<v Speaker 1>with my food and my sleep and all the </v>

1594
01:15:18.151 --> 01:15:20.950
<v Speaker 1>rest of that stuff than the hormones </v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to stay pretty good in line,</v>

1595
01:15:20.951 --> 01:15:25.810
<v Speaker 1>but if they start pushing anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I start compromising sleep for me,</v>

1596
01:15:25.811 --> 01:15:30.811
<v Speaker 1>if I go to low carb too long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly with some really hard </v>

1597
01:15:30.811 --> 01:15:34.141
<v Speaker 1>training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I will kind of get adrenalized and </v>

1598
01:15:34.141 --> 01:15:37.130
<v Speaker 1>I get all the signs and symptoms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone kind of dropping down and </v>

1599
01:15:37.130 --> 01:15:41.070
<v Speaker 1>whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is interesting because I know </v>

1600
01:15:41.070 --> 01:15:43.081
<v Speaker 1>you've played around with that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed out some pretty good success in </v>

1601
01:15:43.081 --> 01:15:43.081
<v Speaker 1>quito.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fueled rolling.</v>

1602
01:15:43.081 --> 01:15:43.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1603
01:15:43.291 --> 01:15:48.291
<v Speaker 2>what I had was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What fascinated me is I'm on </v>

1604
01:15:48.291 --> 01:15:51.321
<v Speaker 2>testosterone replacement therapy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I took my diet away from a high </v>

1605
01:15:52.921 --> 01:15:56.910
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate diet to a much more high </v>
<v Speaker 2>fat diet,</v>

1606
01:15:57.210 --> 01:16:00.510
<v Speaker 2>ketogenic diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my testosterone levels were way up.</v>

1607
01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:05.750
<v Speaker 2>Interesting way up and not just me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a bunch of my friends who were also </v>

1608
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:10.041
<v Speaker 2>on testosterone replacement therapy </v>
<v Speaker 2>reported the same thing where they said </v>

1609
01:16:10.041 --> 01:16:10.410
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend john is stuffed,</v>

1610
01:16:10.411 --> 01:16:11.940
<v Speaker 2>doubled his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

1611
01:16:12.030 --> 01:16:15.810
<v Speaker 2>his levels doubled and he couldn't find </v>
<v Speaker 2>any other variability.</v>

1612
01:16:15.811 --> 01:16:18.660
<v Speaker 2>And it was the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that just free testosterone or fleet</v>

1613
01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:21.040
<v Speaker 2>in total question?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1614
01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:22.620
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1615
01:16:22.650 --> 01:16:24.810
<v Speaker 2>But what it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it is apparently is,</v>

1616
01:16:24.811 --> 01:16:29.811
<v Speaker 2>and please correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the precursors for testosterone are the </v>

1617
01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:34.960
<v Speaker 2>saturated fats and cholesterol in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body produces testosterone from them,</v>

1618
01:16:35.490 --> 01:16:40.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you have an abundance of them and </v>

1619
01:16:40.490 --> 01:16:40.490
<v Speaker 2>you're in a healthy balance like you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1620
01:16:40.490 --> 01:16:43.530
<v Speaker 2>it's not like you're consuming a </v>
<v Speaker 2>unhealthy foods.</v>

1621
01:16:43.890 --> 01:16:48.890
<v Speaker 2>When you get a healthy balance of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body produces more testosterone </v>

1622
01:16:48.890 --> 01:16:48.900
<v Speaker 2>naturally.</v>

1623
01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:50.020
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1624
01:16:50.290 --> 01:16:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's interesting and this is where </v>

1625
01:16:55.290 --> 01:16:57.121
<v Speaker 1>this stuff gets really complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but usually when people are on a lower </v>

1626
01:16:57.121 --> 01:17:01.261
<v Speaker 1>carb diet and this hormone called sex </v>
<v Speaker 1>hormone binding protein or sex hormone </v>

1627
01:17:01.261 --> 01:17:02.980
<v Speaker 1>binding globulin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that increases and what that can do,</v>

1628
01:17:02.981 --> 01:17:06.340
<v Speaker 1>it can reduce the level of free </v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone.</v>

1629
01:17:06.610 --> 01:17:08.470
<v Speaker 1>So your total testosterone may look </v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

1630
01:17:08.471 --> 01:17:12.410
<v Speaker 1>the free testosterone may look great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a not an uncommon thing to happen</v>

1631
01:17:12.411 --> 01:17:16.010
<v Speaker 1>on low carb diets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then the interesting side to that is</v>

1632
01:17:16.011 --> 01:17:21.011
<v Speaker 1>that the receptor sites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are really what matters in this </v>

1633
01:17:21.011 --> 01:17:24.791
<v Speaker 1>whole story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the receptor site density for </v>

1634
01:17:24.791 --> 01:17:28.181
<v Speaker 1>testosterone increases so you may not </v>
<v Speaker 1>need as much to get the same effect that</v>

1635
01:17:29.330 --> 01:17:34.330
<v Speaker 1>you would otherwise have or if you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit more testosterone than </v>

1636
01:17:34.330 --> 01:17:34.330
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get an even greater </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect.</v>

1637
01:17:34.330 --> 01:17:39.101
<v Speaker 1>And so that receptor site density,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what is causing that I don't fully </v>

1638
01:17:41.091 --> 01:17:41.630
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

1639
01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:46.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when people are on a lower carb </v>

1640
01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:49.241
<v Speaker 1>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does appear that anabolic hormones </v>

1641
01:17:49.241 --> 01:17:49.460
<v Speaker 1>have a more pronounced effect and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they would have during a,</v>

1642
01:17:49.550 --> 01:17:54.550
<v Speaker 1>a higher carb period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't really know the mechanism </v>

1643
01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:56.180
<v Speaker 1>behind how that works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it definitely,</v>

1644
01:17:56.181 --> 01:17:57.290
<v Speaker 1>you seem to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1645
01:17:57.291 --> 01:18:02.291
<v Speaker 1>if you have 100 units of testosterone or</v>
<v Speaker 1>estrogen in one person and they have a </v>

1646
01:18:02.781 --> 01:18:06.480
<v Speaker 1>certain number of a receptor sites and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then another person,</v>

1647
01:18:06.481 --> 01:18:11.481
<v Speaker 1>same hormonal level but more receptor </v>
<v Speaker 1>sites than they are going to get them </v>

1648
01:18:11.481 --> 01:18:12.860
<v Speaker 1>more potent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anabolic response out,</v>

1649
01:18:13.420 --> 01:18:15.950
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many variables and then when you take</v>

1650
01:18:15.951 --> 01:18:20.951
<v Speaker 1>into account what we've discussed </v>
<v Speaker 1>already about genetic variables and the </v>

1651
01:18:20.951 --> 01:18:23.801
<v Speaker 1>right bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different people respond differently to </v>

1652
01:18:23.801 --> 01:18:23.801
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

1653
01:18:23.801 --> 01:18:25.760
<v Speaker 2>hydrates and fats and proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is so difficult for people to find </v>

1654
01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:27.540
<v Speaker 2>the thing that works best for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1655
01:18:27.710 --> 01:18:32.710
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me it seems like quito or maybe a </v>

1656
01:18:32.710 --> 01:18:33.750
<v Speaker 2>little bit more carbs and quito is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way to go.</v>

1657
01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:34.660
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1658
01:18:34.770 --> 01:18:39.770
<v Speaker 2>but what I do is one of the big things </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do is have any of it laying right </v>

1659
01:18:39.770 --> 01:18:40.920
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I supplement with exoticness ketones.</v>

1660
01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:41.500
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1661
01:18:41.670 --> 01:18:43.380
<v Speaker 2>and that seems to have a big effect on </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

1662
01:18:43.381 --> 01:18:48.381
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it definitely puts me into a state of </v>

1663
01:18:48.381 --> 01:18:48.381
<v Speaker 2>ketosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use something called key genics,</v>

1664
01:18:48.381 --> 01:18:49.440
<v Speaker 2>but I believe there's some other stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the on the market,</v>

1665
01:18:49.441 --> 01:18:53.700
<v Speaker 2>but dom d'agostino,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is a professor and what is it?</v>

1666
01:18:53.701 --> 01:18:57.480
<v Speaker 2>University of Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he is one of the foremost experts on</v>

1667
01:18:57.481 --> 01:18:59.010
<v Speaker 2>kido and he's coming on the podcast </v>
<v Speaker 2>soon.</v>

1668
01:18:59.011 --> 01:19:02.490
<v Speaker 2>We're working on finding a date,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the meantime,</v>

1669
01:19:02.491 --> 01:19:04.410
<v Speaker 2>his interview with tim ferriss is </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>

1670
01:19:04.410 --> 01:19:07.890
<v Speaker 2>I think he's done twice a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe more on tim show,</v>

1671
01:19:08.250 --> 01:19:13.250
<v Speaker 2>but that when he discusses it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of understand like what the </v>

1672
01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:15.290
<v Speaker 2>benefits of being on this high fat diet </v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

1673
01:19:15.690 --> 01:19:20.690
<v Speaker 2>and then you also realize what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the compromise is that your body </v>

1674
01:19:20.690 --> 01:19:22.860
<v Speaker 2>has to make when you change it to a high</v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate,</v>

1675
01:19:22.861 --> 01:19:27.861
<v Speaker 2>high sugar diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that is a new </v>

1676
01:19:27.861 --> 01:19:31.611
<v Speaker 2>study that dr rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rhonda patrick sent me recently was the </v>

1677
01:19:31.611 --> 01:19:36.501
<v Speaker 2>dangers of saturated fats have been sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of overstated a lot of it because of </v>

1678
01:19:38.311 --> 01:19:43.311
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you're aware that New York </v>

1679
01:19:43.311 --> 01:19:44.961
<v Speaker 2>times article about the sugar industry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally bing scientists lie in the 19 </v>

1680
01:19:45.631 --> 01:19:50.631
<v Speaker 2>fifties and say that heart disease is </v>
<v Speaker 2>being called caused by saturated fats </v>

1681
01:19:50.631 --> 01:19:51.640
<v Speaker 2>and taking the blame off of sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1682
01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:57.080
<v Speaker 2>And they altered data and really fucked </v>
<v Speaker 2>with generations of people's ideas to </v>

1683
01:19:57.080 --> 01:20:01.020
<v Speaker 2>change the information that we receive </v>
<v Speaker 2>and fuck with people's heads.</v>

1684
01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:03.180
<v Speaker 2>But there was a recent study that showed</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1685
01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:08.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>process sugar mixed with saturated is </v>

1686
01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:08.860
<v Speaker 2>actually</v>

1687
01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:13.400
<v Speaker 1>not healthy at all and it actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps could be more unhealthy than </v>

1688
01:20:14.611 --> 01:20:16.020
<v Speaker 1>processed sugar alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1689
01:20:16.050 --> 01:20:18.720
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really makes sense because if we over</v>

1690
01:20:18.721 --> 01:20:21.620
<v Speaker 1>consume carbohydrates in general than </v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1691
01:20:21.670 --> 01:20:26.670
<v Speaker 1>we fill up the liver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>glycogen in the liver starts converting </v>

1692
01:20:26.670 --> 01:20:27.840
<v Speaker 1>this into palmitic acid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a saturated fat.</v>

1693
01:20:28.230 --> 01:20:33.230
<v Speaker 1>And that paul medic acid tends to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>us insulin resistant and indeed good </v>

1694
01:20:33.230 --> 01:20:37.821
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms behind that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's good kind of engineering </v>

1695
01:20:37.821 --> 01:20:40.260
<v Speaker 1>there if we're eating a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 1>of an ancestral type diet,</v>

1696
01:20:40.261 --> 01:20:45.261
<v Speaker 1>but when you throw a modern process diet</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sedentism and messed up circadian </v>

1697
01:20:47.011 --> 01:20:47.580
<v Speaker 1>rhythm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1698
01:20:47.581 --> 01:20:49.410
<v Speaker 1>not going to bed on time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not getting enough,</v>

1699
01:20:49.450 --> 01:20:53.550
<v Speaker 1>a daylight sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the whole mess ends up being really</v>

1700
01:20:53.551 --> 01:20:58.551
<v Speaker 1>pro inflammatory and very much moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>you towards this insulin resistant </v>

1701
01:20:58.551 --> 01:21:02.181
<v Speaker 1>profile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what is it about sugar where when </v>

1702
01:21:02.181 --> 01:21:03.630
<v Speaker 1>you are not consuming it on a regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis,</v>

1703
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:06.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you take some time.</v>

1704
01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:09.720
<v Speaker 1>Like I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten like really strict ketogenic</v>

1705
01:21:09.721 --> 01:21:14.721
<v Speaker 1>for four or five months and then I'll go</v>
<v Speaker 1>off and have like a milkshake and fries </v>

1706
01:21:14.721 --> 01:21:17.730
<v Speaker 1>and I can't fucking believe how bad I </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel.</v>

1707
01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:22.960
<v Speaker 1>And I've got to think that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my body just doesn't know what to do </v>

1708
01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:22.960
<v Speaker 1>with it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>

1709
01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:24.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the state of ketosis,</v>

1710
01:21:24.451 --> 01:21:28.440
<v Speaker 1>so you say normal time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>normally the brain runs off glucose,</v>

1711
01:21:28.441 --> 01:21:30.360
<v Speaker 1>but what's really normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>

1712
01:21:30.510 --> 01:21:34.890
<v Speaker 1>for me normal is trying to look at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>from this ancestral template,</v>

1713
01:21:34.891 --> 01:21:36.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so for eons,</v>

1714
01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:41.870
<v Speaker 1>humans and every other organism on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet didn't have consistent food and </v>

1715
01:21:41.870 --> 01:21:44.130
<v Speaker 1>because our brain is so big and it's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>metabolically active,</v>

1716
01:21:44.131 --> 01:21:47.490
<v Speaker 1>even though I think it's like two </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of our body weight,</v>

1717
01:21:47.491 --> 01:21:52.491
<v Speaker 1>but 20 percent of the energy use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really important that we protect </v>

1718
01:21:52.491 --> 01:21:56.661
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so The process of ketosis is a </v>

1719
01:21:56.661 --> 01:22:00.141
<v Speaker 1>workaround so that we don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>break down protein to convert it into </v>

1720
01:22:00.141 --> 01:22:00.141
<v Speaker 1>glucose.</v>

1721
01:22:00.141 --> 01:22:01.410
<v Speaker 1>To feed the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can break down body fat.</v>

1722
01:22:01.770 --> 01:22:06.770
<v Speaker 1>The body fat gets turned into ketone </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies which are water soluble and can </v>

1723
01:22:06.770 --> 01:22:10.641
<v Speaker 1>go through the blood brain barrier and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can fuel the brain in a really </v>

1724
01:22:10.641 --> 01:22:10.980
<v Speaker 1>effective way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you do that,</v>

1725
01:22:10.981 --> 01:22:13.530
<v Speaker 1>what you are trying to do with spare </v>
<v Speaker 1>glucose,</v>

1726
01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:16.200
<v Speaker 1>just for the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just for the red blood cells,</v>

1727
01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:19.890
<v Speaker 1>the few tissues that have to run on </v>
<v Speaker 1>glucose like they have no,</v>

1728
01:22:20.190 --> 01:22:24.300
<v Speaker 1>no other work around red blood cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then some parts of the brain like so</v>

1729
01:22:24.301 --> 01:22:29.301
<v Speaker 1>some parts of the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're on a really restricted sugar </v>

1730
01:22:29.301 --> 01:22:33.021
<v Speaker 1>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will suffer it initially until you </v>

1731
01:22:33.021 --> 01:22:35.240
<v Speaker 1>get ramped up into ketosis and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fueling more.</v>

1732
01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:36.960
<v Speaker 1>The brain in the numbers vary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1733
01:22:37.210 --> 01:22:42.210
<v Speaker 1>the somewhere between 70,</v>
<v Speaker 1>80 percent of the brain can shift over </v>

1734
01:22:42.210 --> 01:22:44.700
<v Speaker 1>fully to ketone body metabolism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the other 20 can't,</v>

1735
01:22:44.890 --> 01:22:45.900
<v Speaker 1>can't 20 to 30.</v>

1736
01:22:46.050 --> 01:22:47.550
<v Speaker 1>And we always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in ketosis,</v>

1737
01:22:47.551 --> 01:22:52.410
<v Speaker 1>we still have a blood glucose level </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's being metered out by the liver.</v>

1738
01:22:53.010 --> 01:22:58.010
<v Speaker 1>But what the body does is it creates </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's called a metabolic insulin </v>

1739
01:22:58.010 --> 01:23:02.481
<v Speaker 1>resistance where the muscles become </v>
<v Speaker 1>insulin resistant so that we don't use </v>

1740
01:23:02.490 --> 01:23:07.210
<v Speaker 1>glucose in the muscles were using free </v>
<v Speaker 1>acids and we're using ketone bodies.</v>

1741
01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:10.420
<v Speaker 1>So then you go and you've been ketotic </v>
<v Speaker 1>for awhile.</v>

1742
01:23:10.690 --> 01:23:15.690
<v Speaker 1>You have physiological insulin </v>
<v Speaker 1>resistance to support and maintain that </v>

1743
01:23:15.690 --> 01:23:16.900
<v Speaker 1>qi tonic state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's totally fine,</v>

1744
01:23:17.290 --> 01:23:20.650
<v Speaker 1>but then your first meal out of that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the milkshake,</v>

1745
01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:22.710
<v Speaker 1>you knoW,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fries,</v>

1746
01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:27.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 grams of carbohydrate and because </v>

1747
01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:28.360
<v Speaker 1>you're physiologically insulin </v>
<v Speaker 1>resistant,</v>

1748
01:23:28.450 --> 01:23:33.450
<v Speaker 1>it takes a massive amount of insulin to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to push that stuff into storage </v>

1749
01:23:33.450 --> 01:23:36.040
<v Speaker 1>and it will make you feel like death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel terrible.</v>

1750
01:23:36.041 --> 01:23:41.041
<v Speaker 1>I always need a nap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I have headaches and I'm </v>

1751
01:23:41.041 --> 01:23:41.041
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of a pussy if I become like,</v>

1752
01:23:41.041 --> 01:23:43.600
<v Speaker 1>what's happening here because I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be easy for me.</v>

1753
01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:45.850
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know that there's some,</v>

1754
01:23:46.170 --> 01:23:51.170
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting trade off because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could make an argument that we </v>

1755
01:23:51.170 --> 01:23:52.840
<v Speaker 1>should be able to live like a cockroach </v>
<v Speaker 1>and like you just,</v>

1756
01:23:52.980 --> 01:23:54.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bounce back and forth,</v>

1757
01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:59.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under ideal circumstances we would be </v>

1758
01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:01.960
<v Speaker 1>resilient and we could be able to shift </v>
<v Speaker 1>these fuel substrates.</v>

1759
01:24:01.990 --> 01:24:06.990
<v Speaker 1>And this is some of the argument for </v>
<v Speaker 1>like intermittent fasting where you </v>

1760
01:24:06.990 --> 01:24:10.981
<v Speaker 1>force your body to run off of fats and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you do a carbohydrates every </v>

1761
01:24:11.111 --> 01:24:16.111
<v Speaker 1>couple of days or maybe earlier in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day and then later in the day it's just </v>

1762
01:24:16.111 --> 01:24:20.010
<v Speaker 1>a fat and protein and then you fast </v>
<v Speaker 1>through part of the next day so that </v>

1763
01:24:20.201 --> 01:24:23.650
<v Speaker 1>you're forcing your body to run off fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>to produce some key tones,</v>

1764
01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:26.560
<v Speaker 1>maybe not at a level of full nutritional</v>
<v Speaker 1>ketosis.</v>

1765
01:24:26.980 --> 01:24:29.080
<v Speaker 1>But then also when you do drop in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>carbs,</v>

1766
01:24:29.081 --> 01:24:34.081
<v Speaker 1>your body can handle that and it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>put you into that kinda like diabetic </v>

1767
01:24:34.081 --> 01:24:34.540
<v Speaker 1>blood sugar levels.</v>

1768
01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:35.110
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1769
01:24:35.111 --> 01:24:37.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all really speculative.</v>

1770
01:24:37.151 --> 01:24:40.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know what the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer is with any of that stuff,</v>

1771
01:24:40.541 --> 01:24:44.750
<v Speaker 1>but it is interesting and it does kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of call into question the,</v>

1772
01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:49.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how useful is chronic ketosis relative </v>

1773
01:24:49.790 --> 01:24:51.400
<v Speaker 1>to being able to cycle in and out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't have a good answer,</v>

1774
01:24:51.401 --> 01:24:53.890
<v Speaker 1>but I definitely feel best when I'm qi </v>
<v Speaker 1>tonic.</v>

1775
01:24:54.310 --> 01:24:59.310
<v Speaker 1>You feel best when your qi tonic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you tend to do a little bit higher </v>

1776
01:24:59.310 --> 01:25:00.760
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrate to fuel the jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jujitsu.</v>

1777
01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:06.060
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that doesn't knock you out of a </v>

1778
01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:06.060
<v Speaker 1>state of ketosis as long as you've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly consistent.</v>

1779
01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:07.090
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I do.</v>

1780
01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:11.560
<v Speaker 1>So when I'm fully keto adapted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the blood ketone levels are higher.</v>

1781
01:25:11.561 --> 01:25:13.690
<v Speaker 1>And also like if I needed to miss a </v>
<v Speaker 1>meal,</v>

1782
01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:15.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I just didn't get breakfast,</v>

1783
01:25:15.161 --> 01:25:15.730
<v Speaker 1>lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dinner,</v>

1784
01:25:15.731 --> 01:25:18.490
<v Speaker 1>and I want a full day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be inconsequential,</v>

1785
01:25:18.491 --> 01:25:21.000
<v Speaker 1>like I would be a little hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it really wouldn't affect me.</v>

1786
01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:23.980
<v Speaker 1>That's the biggest benefit of opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huge.</v>

1787
01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:29.040
<v Speaker 1>And so when I do that 75 to 120 grams of</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbs to fuel the jujitsu,</v>

1788
01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:34.180
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that as easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 10 hours and 12 hours in of uh,</v>

1789
01:25:34.230 --> 01:25:35.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1790
01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:37.240
<v Speaker 1>so I sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll sleep through the night.</v>

1791
01:25:37.241 --> 01:25:39.420
<v Speaker 1>So I've got a 12 hour fast then I get up</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1792
01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:41.530
<v Speaker 1>if I tried to go to 6:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>PM that day,</v>

1793
01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:46.620
<v Speaker 1>I'd be hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be totally broken down </v>

1794
01:25:46.620 --> 01:25:48.550
<v Speaker 1>dysfunctional like I was when I was know</v>
<v Speaker 1>insulin resistant sugar burner.</v>

1795
01:25:48.610 --> 01:25:51.220
<v Speaker 1>But it's not the same as being keto </v>
<v Speaker 1>adapted now.</v>

1796
01:25:51.221 --> 01:25:54.160
<v Speaker 1>Do you mess it all with exogenous </v>
<v Speaker 1>ketones?</v>

1797
01:25:54.161 --> 01:25:57.190
<v Speaker 1>I do a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the ketone salts give me the trots.</v>

1798
01:25:57.310 --> 01:25:59.650
<v Speaker 1>So Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are kind of rough.</v>

1799
01:25:59.651 --> 01:26:04.651
<v Speaker 1>I do a lot of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a caveman coffee and then they're mct </v>

1800
01:26:04.651 --> 01:26:08.260
<v Speaker 1>oil and I'll actually mix that up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>peanut butter and then either a soy </v>

1801
01:26:08.271 --> 01:26:11.930
<v Speaker 1>lecithin or a sunflower less than </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it kind of a multifocal.</v>

1802
01:26:11.950 --> 01:26:14.540
<v Speaker 1>All that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll mix it up together and then I'll</v>

1803
01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:19.570
<v Speaker 1>eat that and I get a decent point five </v>
<v Speaker 1>millimolar blood ketone level off of </v>

1804
01:26:20.221 --> 01:26:22.100
<v Speaker 1>that even though I'm eating some carbs </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

1805
01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:27.400
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you're your peanut butter is a </v>

1806
01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:28.370
<v Speaker 1>sugar free peanut butter natural peanut </v>
<v Speaker 1>butter peanut butter peanut butter.</v>

1807
01:26:28.371 --> 01:26:29.450
<v Speaker 1>People say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh jeff,</v>

1808
01:26:29.451 --> 01:26:32.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to just eat it by the tub and </v>
<v Speaker 1>while you will.</v>

1809
01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:37.240
<v Speaker 1>And then peanuts or are legumes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a bunch of like super </v>

1810
01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:42.071
<v Speaker 1>hardcore paleo folks that are freaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and dying right now that I'm eating </v>

1811
01:26:42.071 --> 01:26:45.971
<v Speaker 1>peanut butter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now why don't paleo people like </v>

1812
01:26:45.971 --> 01:26:46.130
<v Speaker 1>peanuts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck's wrong with them?</v>

1813
01:26:46.131 --> 01:26:50.780
<v Speaker 1>So legumes do have some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we call immunogenic properties.</v>

1814
01:26:50.781 --> 01:26:55.781
<v Speaker 1>They can irritate the immune system and </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you improperly prepare them then they</v>

1815
01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:58.160
<v Speaker 1>can make you really sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you.</v>

1816
01:26:58.220 --> 01:27:01.180
<v Speaker 1>If you cooked some black beans or kidney</v>
<v Speaker 1>beans or something,</v>

1817
01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:02.690
<v Speaker 1>you didn't cook them enough and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>weighed them,</v>

1818
01:27:03.610 --> 01:27:04.720
<v Speaker 1>it can give you gas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1819
01:27:04.721 --> 01:27:07.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like where you're shitting blood </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>

1820
01:27:07.580 --> 01:27:12.580
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty pretty nasty stuff and these</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the anti predation chemicals that </v>

1821
01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:15.440
<v Speaker 1>are in grains and legumes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you soak them overnight,</v>

1822
01:27:15.490 --> 01:27:20.490
<v Speaker 1>you pull off the rinse water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe sprout them for a day and you </v>

1823
01:27:20.490 --> 01:27:22.460
<v Speaker 1>don't even have to do that involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or if you cook them in a medium that has</v>

1824
01:27:22.461 --> 01:27:27.461
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of acid in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it tends to break down these anti </v>

1825
01:27:27.461 --> 01:27:27.980
<v Speaker 1>nutrients and they're not nearly as </v>
<v Speaker 1>immunogenic,</v>

1826
01:27:27.981 --> 01:27:32.530
<v Speaker 1>but somebody who has serious gi problems</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this circles back again to that,</v>

1827
01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:34.670
<v Speaker 1>that small intestinal bacterial </v>
<v Speaker 1>overgrowth.</v>

1828
01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Somebody who has cbo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody has some other gi probLems.</v>

1829
01:27:37.791 --> 01:27:41.810
<v Speaker 1>if they have an autoimmune condition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grains and legumes may be something that</v>

1830
01:27:41.811 --> 01:27:44.390
<v Speaker 1>you want to minimize because it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>immunogenic.</v>

1831
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:49.390
<v Speaker 1>For a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the success that we've seen </v>

1832
01:27:49.390 --> 01:27:51.210
<v Speaker 1>with this autoimmune paleo approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that the,</v>

1833
01:27:51.510 --> 01:27:54.830
<v Speaker 1>the unfortunate thIng is on the one </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand,</v>

1834
01:27:54.831 --> 01:27:59.831
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of people who dismissed </v>
<v Speaker 1>the power of limiting these foods in </v>

1835
01:27:59.831 --> 01:28:03.971
<v Speaker 1>people that would benefit their.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no science to support it </v>

1836
01:28:03.971 --> 01:28:05.810
<v Speaker 1>and they've never invested a minute </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards researching it.</v>

1837
01:28:05.811 --> 01:28:08.600
<v Speaker 1>So they're ignorant about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then on the other side,</v>

1838
01:28:08.601 --> 01:28:13.601
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole group of people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they had success with this </v>

1839
01:28:13.601 --> 01:28:15.290
<v Speaker 1>autoimmune paleo protocol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had ulcerative colitis,</v>

1840
01:28:15.291 --> 01:28:18.080
<v Speaker 1>they had multiple sclerosis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had success for it.</v>

1841
01:28:18.530 --> 01:28:23.530
<v Speaker 1>Now they say that nobody can or should </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat these foods and you know,</v>

1842
01:28:24.171 --> 01:28:26.210
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to throw myself under the bus.</v>

1843
01:28:26.211 --> 01:28:28.730
<v Speaker 1>I've probably been that person for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>decade or longer,</v>

1844
01:28:28.731 --> 01:28:30.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but over the course of time,</v>

1845
01:28:30.711 --> 01:28:32.960
<v Speaker 1>just life it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that jujitsu thing again,</v>

1846
01:28:32.961 --> 01:28:35.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's like the truth will pound you</v>

1847
01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:40.960
<v Speaker 1>and at some point you either get it or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just become this like calcified old </v>

1848
01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:42.320
<v Speaker 1>turd and you can't learn or grow.</v>

1849
01:28:42.770 --> 01:28:47.770
<v Speaker 1>And over the course of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just became obvious that if your gut </v>

1850
01:28:47.770 --> 01:28:48.500
<v Speaker 1>is healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if all the cylinders are firing,</v>

1851
01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:53.980
<v Speaker 1>doing some grains and legumes is </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not going to be a negative </v>

1852
01:28:53.980 --> 01:28:57.050
<v Speaker 1>problem for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you are a cop or a firefighter in</v>

1853
01:28:57.051 --> 01:29:02.051
<v Speaker 1>the military and you've historically </v>
<v Speaker 1>been able to eat these foods and then </v>

1854
01:29:02.051 --> 01:29:05.711
<v Speaker 1>you go to a shift work schedule and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're under a massive amount of stress </v>

1855
01:29:05.711 --> 01:29:09.351
<v Speaker 1>because of an altered sleep wake cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those foods that may have been okay may </v>

1856
01:29:09.351 --> 01:29:13.851
<v Speaker 1>no longer now be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's another piece that people </v>

1857
01:29:13.851 --> 01:29:18.021
<v Speaker 1>just need to remain open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That something that's working for you </v>

1858
01:29:18.021 --> 01:29:19.200
<v Speaker 1>today may not work for you tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>

1859
01:29:19.201 --> 01:29:21.650
<v Speaker 1>something that worked for me may not </v>
<v Speaker 1>work for this other person.</v>

1860
01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:26.660
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of common sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people just desperately in this </v>

1861
01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:26.660
<v Speaker 1>health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wellness,</v>

1862
01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:29.370
<v Speaker 1>nutrition realm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want black or white,</v>

1863
01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:31.380
<v Speaker 1>yes or no binary stuff.</v>

1864
01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:32.760
<v Speaker 1>This is good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's bad.</v>

1865
01:29:32.790 --> 01:29:37.790
<v Speaker 1>And as much as I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would make my life way simpler if </v>

1866
01:29:37.790 --> 01:29:41.571
<v Speaker 1>that was the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's just not like there's all this </v>

1867
01:29:41.571 --> 01:29:42.630
<v Speaker 1>variability in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you familiar with the dunning kruger</v>

1868
01:29:42.631 --> 01:29:44.010
<v Speaker 1>effect?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1869
01:29:44.070 --> 01:29:45.000
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1870
01:29:45.530 --> 01:29:48.000
<v Speaker 1>so dunning kruger effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you do like the x,</v>

1871
01:29:48.001 --> 01:29:52.170
<v Speaker 1>y axis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the x axis is going out and this is time</v>

1872
01:29:52.171 --> 01:29:57.171
<v Speaker 1>and the y axis is your perceived </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge on a topic when you don't have</v>

1873
01:29:57.301 --> 01:29:59.880
<v Speaker 1>any time in a topic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you assume that you know everything</v>

1874
01:29:59.881 --> 01:30:04.881
<v Speaker 1>about it and they call it mount stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I spent a lot of time in mount </v>

1875
01:30:04.881 --> 01:30:05.250
<v Speaker 1>stupid and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we all,</v>

1876
01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:07.950
<v Speaker 1>as we all have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's this low,</v>

1877
01:30:08.030 --> 01:30:10.920
<v Speaker 1>like low abv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dark teatime of the soul.</v>

1878
01:30:10.921 --> 01:30:11.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you've been in it.</v>

1879
01:30:11.971 --> 01:30:12.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there we go.</v>

1880
01:30:13.140 --> 01:30:16.260
<v Speaker 1>And so as that stretches out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you get some,</v>

1881
01:30:16.650 --> 01:30:19.040
<v Speaker 1>hopefully some degree of aptitude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

1882
01:30:19.650 --> 01:30:24.650
<v Speaker 1>as you learn more and more and more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're confident about any given topic </v>

1883
01:30:24.650 --> 01:30:25.230
<v Speaker 1>just starts going down more and more.</v>

1884
01:30:25.290 --> 01:30:26.850
<v Speaker 1>And I'm at this point now where I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1885
01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:30.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I know anything about </v>
<v Speaker 1>any topic.</v>

1886
01:30:30.481 --> 01:30:32.640
<v Speaker 1>And I guess that that's kind of a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

1887
01:30:32.670 --> 01:30:36.390
<v Speaker 1>Ten years ago I was much more confident </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a whole host of things.</v>

1888
01:30:36.391 --> 01:30:38.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a right answer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a wrong answer,</v>

1889
01:30:38.611 --> 01:30:41.790
<v Speaker 1>and today I just really don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1890
01:30:41.791 --> 01:30:45.600
<v Speaker 1>there's a great expression about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the lake of knowledge increases,</v>

1891
01:30:45.601 --> 01:30:47.790
<v Speaker 1>the shoreline of ignorance grows as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

1892
01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:53.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think dennis mckenna had to take onto </v>

1893
01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:56.271
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you increase the bonfire of </v>

1894
01:30:56.271 --> 01:30:58.191
<v Speaker 1>knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it exposes the greater level of </v>

1895
01:30:58.191 --> 01:31:01.850
<v Speaker 1>ignorance the light does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a natural human tendency for some </v>

1896
01:31:02.341 --> 01:31:07.341
<v Speaker 1>strange reason to want to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything or to want to pretend you </v>

1897
01:31:07.341 --> 01:31:07.341
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

1898
01:31:07.341 --> 01:31:07.590
<v Speaker 1>It's like a defensive mechanism or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1899
01:31:07.591 --> 01:31:12.591
<v Speaker 1>Definitely is a defensive mechanism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just so appealing to to basically </v>

1900
01:31:13.021 --> 01:31:16.830
<v Speaker 1>put a fence around what your current </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge status and be like.</v>

1901
01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:18.150
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're good.</v>

1902
01:31:18.151 --> 01:31:21.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really tough deal to just kind of</v>

1903
01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:23.250
<v Speaker 1>dangling the breeze and to hang that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sign,</v>

1904
01:31:23.251 --> 01:31:23.850
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

1905
01:31:23.851 --> 01:31:25.260
<v Speaker 1>Until further notice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1906
01:31:25.350 --> 01:31:30.350
<v Speaker 1>and that's why today it's so weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can find other people that </v>

1907
01:31:30.350 --> 01:31:33.291
<v Speaker 1>agree with you on that and they pump you</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and give you that confirmation bias </v>

1908
01:31:33.291 --> 01:31:36.570
<v Speaker 1>and they support each other and they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>together and make fun of everybody who's</v>

1909
01:31:36.571 --> 01:31:39.510
<v Speaker 1>not in the nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That hashtag woke.</v>

1910
01:31:39.670 --> 01:31:41.610
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh god.</v>

1911
01:31:42.930 --> 01:31:47.930
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a lot of that like running across </v>

1912
01:31:47.930 --> 01:31:50.150
<v Speaker 1>fit type gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would recommend this low carb paleo </v>

1913
01:31:50.150 --> 01:31:52.530
<v Speaker 1>type of approach and for people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were insulin resistant,</v>

1914
01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:54.930
<v Speaker 1>overweight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it worked amazingly well.</v>

1915
01:31:55.470 --> 01:32:00.470
<v Speaker 1>And then when I started working with </v>
<v Speaker 1>more mma oriented folks and a cross </v>

1916
01:32:00.750 --> 01:32:02.310
<v Speaker 1>fitters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1917
01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:06.280
<v Speaker 1>it took a long time and breaking a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people to figure out,</v>

1918
01:32:06.281 --> 01:32:07.990
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people need some more carbs,</v>

1919
01:32:07.991 --> 01:32:12.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they may not need as much as what </v>

1920
01:32:12.991 --> 01:32:14.851
<v Speaker 1>they've historically done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's fully quito fuel process is </v>

1921
01:32:14.851 --> 01:32:15.400
<v Speaker 1>probably not going to work with them.</v>

1922
01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:18.100
<v Speaker 1>And it broke some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including myself.</v>

1923
01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:23.160
<v Speaker 1>What's very hard for people to wrap </v>
<v Speaker 1>their head around the idea that eating </v>

1924
01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:26.881
<v Speaker 1>fruit is not a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like eating too much fruit could be bad </v>

1925
01:32:26.881 --> 01:32:26.881
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are lIke,</v>

1926
01:32:26.881 --> 01:32:27.160
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1927
01:32:27.161 --> 01:32:32.161
<v Speaker 1>you can eat a banana and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>strawberries and some grapes and an </v>

1928
01:32:32.161 --> 01:32:34.990
<v Speaker 1>orange and I feel great and some people </v>
<v Speaker 1>might,</v>

1929
01:32:34.991 --> 01:32:37.500
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of people that can get</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the deep end of the,</v>

1930
01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:38.500
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1931
01:32:38.501 --> 01:32:40.910
<v Speaker 1>the blood sugar management story with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1932
01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:42.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1933
01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:45.220
<v Speaker 1>That seems so counterintuitive to what </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been told as kids.</v>

1934
01:32:45.250 --> 01:32:47.290
<v Speaker 1>Like you have some fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good for you.</v>

1935
01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:49.030
<v Speaker 1>It tastes good and it's good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1936
01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:49.570
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1937
01:32:49.571 --> 01:32:50.590
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good for you.</v>

1938
01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:52.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>

1939
01:32:52.061 --> 01:32:53.010
<v Speaker 1>We have these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1940
01:32:53.470 --> 01:32:58.470
<v Speaker 1>old variety crab apples on my property,</v>
<v Speaker 1>johnny appleseed kind of deal and that's</v>

1941
01:32:58.511 --> 01:33:00.820
<v Speaker 1>what apple's effectively used to be.</v>

1942
01:33:00.850 --> 01:33:02.710
<v Speaker 1>We can narrow those at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1943
01:33:02.790 --> 01:33:04.660
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we make cider out of it and it turns,</v>

1944
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.250
<v Speaker 1>turns pretty good for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1945
01:33:07.380 --> 01:33:11.440
<v Speaker 1>if you pull up like an image of what an </v>
<v Speaker 1>original banana looks like,</v>

1946
01:33:11.470 --> 01:33:12.310
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're ridiculous.</v>

1947
01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Like seed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1948
01:33:13.961 --> 01:33:17.980
<v Speaker 1>It's tiny and it's all seeds and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>hardly any edible structure to it.</v>

1949
01:33:17.981 --> 01:33:22.981
<v Speaker 1>And so if you look at most of the fruit </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was available kind of pre </v>

1950
01:33:22.981 --> 01:33:22.981
<v Speaker 1>agriculture and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1951
01:33:22.981 --> 01:33:26.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a selective breeding of fruit,</v>

1952
01:33:26.081 --> 01:33:28.360
<v Speaker 1>like it was much smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't as sweet.</v>

1953
01:33:28.810 --> 01:33:33.810
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not to say that you shouldn't have </v>

1954
01:33:33.810 --> 01:33:33.810
<v Speaker 1>any of that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just,</v>

1955
01:33:33.810 --> 01:33:37.770
<v Speaker 1>there was a interesting piece that came </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the uk where it was looking at </v>

1956
01:33:37.770 --> 01:33:38.800
<v Speaker 1>feeding kids fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

1957
01:33:38.801 --> 01:33:43.801
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's recommend that these kids eat </v>

1958
01:33:43.801 --> 01:33:44.590
<v Speaker 1>fruit and the kids already had a hyper </v>
<v Speaker 1>caloric diet.</v>

1959
01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:46.000
<v Speaker 1>They were eating too much.</v>

1960
01:33:46.090 --> 01:33:51.090
<v Speaker 1>They were eating too many carbs and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they threw fruit on top of it and </v>

1961
01:33:51.090 --> 01:33:51.130
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1962
01:33:51.190 --> 01:33:55.660
<v Speaker 1>adding fruit to this already shitty </v>
<v Speaker 1>overeating program made it worse,</v>

1963
01:33:55.661 --> 01:34:00.661
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was like there was going to be </v>

1964
01:34:00.661 --> 01:34:01.810
<v Speaker 1>some sort of magic that came out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>adding some fruit to this story.</v>

1965
01:34:01.811 --> 01:34:06.811
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the kids just needed to pull </v>
<v Speaker 1>more of the junk out and get some sort </v>

1966
01:34:06.811 --> 01:34:11.041
<v Speaker 1>of both caloric control land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some carbohydrate control is really </v>

1967
01:34:11.041 --> 01:34:15.811
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there any fruit that is in its </v>

1968
01:34:15.811 --> 01:34:15.811
<v Speaker 1>original state?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe pomegranates,</v>

1969
01:34:15.811 --> 01:34:18.370
<v Speaker 1>they kinda berries are pretty pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1970
01:34:18.371 --> 01:34:19.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blueberries,</v>

1971
01:34:19.481 --> 01:34:24.481
<v Speaker 1>blackberries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so sorts of things while they're pretty </v>

1972
01:34:24.481 --> 01:34:26.060
<v Speaker 1>similar to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweet.</v>

1973
01:34:26.230 --> 01:34:27.850
<v Speaker 1>Not that sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No different.</v>

1974
01:34:27.851 --> 01:34:28.740
<v Speaker 1>Different flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1975
01:34:28.780 --> 01:34:29.680
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1976
01:34:30.070 --> 01:34:32.200
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've picked them like in the wild,</v>

1977
01:34:32.230 --> 01:34:35.050
<v Speaker 1>like in the back country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a blueberry and it just like,</v>

1978
01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:36.520
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not bad,</v>

1979
01:34:36.521 --> 01:34:37.660
<v Speaker 1>but it's not spectacular.</v>

1980
01:34:37.670 --> 01:34:39.220
<v Speaker 1>It's not what you're used to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1981
01:34:39.490 --> 01:34:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1982
01:34:40.050 --> 01:34:43.960
<v Speaker 1>but oranges clearly they have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked with,</v>

1983
01:34:44.050 --> 01:34:44.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1984
01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Apple's like we were on a trip once and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bought these apples and they were </v>

1985
01:34:49.811 --> 01:34:52.960
<v Speaker 1>literally like the size of a softball </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you bite into it.</v>

1986
01:34:52.961 --> 01:34:55.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like the most delicious dessert you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could ever have.</v>

1987
01:34:55.211 --> 01:34:58.010
<v Speaker 1>Like this can't be a fucking real </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular apple.</v>

1988
01:34:58.011 --> 01:34:59.280
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something's been going on.</v>

1989
01:34:59.290 --> 01:35:00.580
<v Speaker 1>Or noble apple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1990
01:35:00.590 --> 01:35:03.080
<v Speaker 1>how much of our food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean especially at our fruit,</v>

1991
01:35:03.081 --> 01:35:08.081
<v Speaker 1>how much of it is genetically altered?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be massive amounts and you </v>

1992
01:35:08.081 --> 01:35:10.190
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gmo story.</v>

1993
01:35:10.191 --> 01:35:15.191
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a spot where I usually piss </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody off about it because I am way </v>

1994
01:35:15.351 --> 01:35:20.351
<v Speaker 1>less concerned about genetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>modification of these things and more </v>

1995
01:35:20.511 --> 01:35:22.960
<v Speaker 1>concerned about some of the business </v>
<v Speaker 1>practices that happen,</v>

1996
01:35:22.970 --> 01:35:27.970
<v Speaker 1>like we've been doing selective breeding</v>
<v Speaker 1>for thousands of years and that has </v>

1997
01:35:27.970 --> 01:35:29.990
<v Speaker 1>modified the genetics back to the wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turning into dog story like that,</v>

1998
01:35:29.991 --> 01:35:31.970
<v Speaker 1>tomatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and without.</v>

1999
01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:37.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean the classic thoughts of franken </v>
<v Speaker 1>foods meaning laboratory,</v>

2000
01:35:37.730 --> 01:35:41.000
<v Speaker 1>some sort of injection into that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on.</v>

2001
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:46.030
<v Speaker 1>Selective breeding for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of it's selective breeding and the </v>

2002
01:35:46.030 --> 01:35:47.570
<v Speaker 1>thing about gmo to is the apologist for </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2003
01:35:47.571 --> 01:35:51.500
<v Speaker 1>Like when you look at the results that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get with the gmo,</v>

2004
01:35:51.501 --> 01:35:54.680
<v Speaker 1>the genetic modification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really unimpressive.</v>

2005
01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:58.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not like dramatically </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasing yields.</v>

2006
01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:03.560
<v Speaker 1>What it inevitably is doing is creating </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's usually more resistant </v>

2007
01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:07.210
<v Speaker 1>to roundup than what the last thing was </v>
<v Speaker 1>wound up being that pesticide foster,</v>

2008
01:36:07.370 --> 01:36:08.110
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2009
01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:13.120
<v Speaker 1>Which is legitimately some pretty nasty </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and so it doesn't really seem to </v>

2010
01:36:13.401 --> 01:36:17.450
<v Speaker 1>be working any type of magic as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeding the world or anything like that.</v>

2011
01:36:17.451 --> 01:36:21.140
<v Speaker 1>It is creating a funnel where in order </v>
<v Speaker 1>to grow this thing,</v>

2012
01:36:21.141 --> 01:36:26.141
<v Speaker 1>you need more chemical fertilizer input,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need more pesticide input and it </v>

2013
01:36:26.661 --> 01:36:29.240
<v Speaker 1>just seems to be this feed forward </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanism on that.</v>

2014
01:36:29.330 --> 01:36:32.220
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really from a health standpoint,</v>

2015
01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:36.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that freaked out aBout gmos just</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a baseline,</v>

2016
01:36:36.051 --> 01:36:39.170
<v Speaker 1>but from a really shady business </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice.</v>

2017
01:36:39.230 --> 01:36:41.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a big fan from a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2018
01:36:41.150 --> 01:36:43.640
<v Speaker 1>actually moving the needle on food </v>
<v Speaker 1>production.</v>

2019
01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.760
<v Speaker 1>It's really unimpressive to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

2020
01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:52.120
<v Speaker 1>my position on gmos usually just makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody mad because I'm not really </v>

2021
01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:53.450
<v Speaker 1>jumping into either one of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these camps,</v>

2022
01:36:53.451 --> 01:36:55.580
<v Speaker 1>whole hog with food production in </v>
<v Speaker 1>general.</v>

2023
01:36:55.581 --> 01:36:58.550
<v Speaker 1>When you look at these gigantic large </v>
<v Speaker 1>scale farms that has,</v>

2024
01:36:58.580 --> 01:37:01.730
<v Speaker 1>that is one of the most unnatural things</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're ever going to see in life.</v>

2025
01:37:01.850 --> 01:37:04.310
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's giant cornfields,</v>

2026
01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:05.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so unnatural,</v>

2027
01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:07.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>monocrop.</v>

2028
01:37:07.190 --> 01:37:08.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not only that monocrop,</v>

2029
01:37:08.661 --> 01:37:12.400
<v Speaker 1>but those are genetically modified crops</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2030
01:37:12.401 --> 01:37:17.401
<v Speaker 1>and you want to kill off all the weeds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spraying your genetiCally modified mono </v>

2031
01:37:17.401 --> 01:37:18.470
<v Speaker 1>crops with some shit that kills off </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

2032
01:37:18.471 --> 01:37:23.471
<v Speaker 1>but you're genetically modified model </v>
<v Speaker 1>crops and who knows what that </v>

2033
01:37:23.471 --> 01:37:24.470
<v Speaker 1>consequences on the human body will.</v>

2034
01:37:25.540 --> 01:37:30.540
<v Speaker 1>So a roundup is now being suggested or </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been suggested for a long time as a </v>

2035
01:37:31.131 --> 01:37:34.940
<v Speaker 1>mitochondrial disruptor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar to that antibiotic story.</v>

2036
01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:38.030
<v Speaker 1>So tHis is where people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the last questions about like,</v>

2037
01:37:38.031 --> 01:37:40.250
<v Speaker 1>well what about this gluten intolerance </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

2038
01:37:40.251 --> 01:37:43.610
<v Speaker 1>Like people didn't have it 50 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is it going on now?</v>

2039
01:37:43.611 --> 01:37:46.220
<v Speaker 1>And we really don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe it's antibiotics,</v>

2040
01:37:46.221 --> 01:37:48.290
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's changes in the gut </v>
<v Speaker 1>microbiome,</v>

2041
01:37:48.710 --> 01:37:52.370
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of this stuff seems to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mitochondrial dysfunction piece to it.</v>

2042
01:37:52.490 --> 01:37:53.990
<v Speaker 1>Parkinson's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alzheimer's,</v>

2043
01:37:53.991 --> 01:37:58.991
<v Speaker 1>type two diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all seem to have mitochondrial </v>

2044
01:37:58.991 --> 01:38:01.260
<v Speaker 1>dysfunction elements to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mitochondria is not producing energy</v>

2045
01:38:01.261 --> 01:38:04.320
<v Speaker 1>the way that it should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And back again to that point about being</v>

2046
01:38:04.321 --> 01:38:09.321
<v Speaker 1>flexible with our fuel systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people seem to becoming inflexible in </v>

2047
01:38:09.321 --> 01:38:13.611
<v Speaker 1>their fuel systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this key todrick state may be the </v>

2048
01:38:13.611 --> 01:38:17.451
<v Speaker 1>default that we're able to go back to to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to maintain some degree of </v>

2049
01:38:17.451 --> 01:38:21.231
<v Speaker 1>health and it also seems to press a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reset button in the mitochondria where </v>

2050
01:38:21.231 --> 01:38:24.120
<v Speaker 1>we get apoptosis and cell death and </v>
<v Speaker 1>abnormal cells,</v>

2051
01:38:24.121 --> 01:38:29.121
<v Speaker 1>but the need for people to shift towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lower carb diet may be reflective of </v>

2052
01:38:29.121 --> 01:38:33.861
<v Speaker 1>some changes in the environment where </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're being made sick by things like </v>

2053
01:38:33.861 --> 01:38:38.481
<v Speaker 1>glyophosphate or maybe an over </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive antibiotic use and then the </v>

2054
01:38:38.481 --> 01:38:43.131
<v Speaker 1>thing that we need to default back to to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to be healthy as some sort of a </v>

2055
01:38:43.131 --> 01:38:43.131
<v Speaker 1>low carb or ketogenic diet.</v>

2056
01:38:43.590 --> 01:38:48.590
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about foods and </v>

2057
01:38:48.590 --> 01:38:52.491
<v Speaker 1>foods that people eat and breads and </v>
<v Speaker 1>gluten deficiencies or gluten </v>

2058
01:38:52.491 --> 01:38:56.660
<v Speaker 1>intolerances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about sprouted breads and what are </v>

2059
01:38:56.660 --> 01:38:59.941
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the difference between </v>

2060
01:38:59.941 --> 01:38:59.941
<v Speaker 1>something like a zucchini bread and say </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a wonder bread?</v>

2061
01:38:59.941 --> 01:39:01.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so within the zucchini bread,</v>

2062
01:39:01.081 --> 01:39:03.750
<v Speaker 1>they soak these grains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pour off the water,</v>

2063
01:39:03.751 --> 01:39:06.030
<v Speaker 1>let them sprout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in that sprouting process,</v>

2064
01:39:06.031 --> 01:39:10.800
<v Speaker 1>the enzymes that are released tend to </v>
<v Speaker 1>break up the gluten and gluten proteins.</v>

2065
01:39:11.190 --> 01:39:16.190
<v Speaker 1>And for a lot of people who are gluten </v>
<v Speaker 1>intolerant with like a piece of wonder </v>

2066
01:39:16.190 --> 01:39:20.151
<v Speaker 1>bread or standard french bread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could eat something like these </v>

2067
01:39:20.151 --> 01:39:20.370
<v Speaker 1>equal bread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not everybody can.</v>

2068
01:39:20.371 --> 01:39:25.371
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if I had a piece when I hit your </v>

2069
01:39:25.371 --> 01:39:29.061
<v Speaker 1>bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would need a priest and an exorcism </v>

2070
01:39:29.061 --> 01:39:30.870
<v Speaker 1>that you would break it over and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know I was never.</v>

2071
01:39:30.871 --> 01:39:33.750
<v Speaker 1>We've looked at celiac is a gluten </v>
<v Speaker 1>intolerance,</v>

2072
01:39:33.751 --> 01:39:38.751
<v Speaker 1>but if I get some sort of a wheat </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposure and it's to the degree that </v>

2073
01:39:38.751 --> 01:39:42.390
<v Speaker 1>like if a steak is grilled on a grill </v>
<v Speaker 1>and somebody grilled french toast on the</v>

2074
01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:44.820
<v Speaker 1>grilled the day before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be sick from it.</v>

2075
01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:47.040
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like the canary in the coal mine </v>
<v Speaker 1>on it sucks.</v>

2076
01:39:47.041 --> 01:39:48.780
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>

2077
01:39:48.781 --> 01:39:53.781
<v Speaker 1>But does it have any bay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it have any effect on nutrient </v>

2078
01:39:53.781 --> 01:39:56.331
<v Speaker 1>absorption because of the celiacs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A big part of it is when you're exposed </v>

2079
01:39:56.521 --> 01:40:01.521
<v Speaker 1>to that bread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just that you go to get </v>

2080
01:40:01.521 --> 01:40:01.521
<v Speaker 1>diarrhea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they.</v>

2081
01:40:01.521 --> 01:40:01.521
<v Speaker 1>The nutrients are not getting into your </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

2082
01:40:01.521 --> 01:40:03.060
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of the intestinal permeability.</v>

2083
01:40:03.061 --> 01:40:05.220
<v Speaker 1>The way I got into all this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was really,</v>

2084
01:40:05.221 --> 01:40:10.221
<v Speaker 1>really sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And had all sort of colitis and I'm </v>

2085
01:40:10.221 --> 01:40:12.360
<v Speaker 1>about 175 pounds right now when my </v>
<v Speaker 1>ulcerative colitis was at its worst,</v>

2086
01:40:12.420 --> 01:40:16.410
<v Speaker 1>I was 130 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was 40 pounds skinnier.</v>

2087
01:40:16.411 --> 01:40:18.380
<v Speaker 1>How old are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 45 now.</v>

2088
01:40:18.410 --> 01:40:20.460
<v Speaker 1>But now how old were you then at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>point?</v>

2089
01:40:20.461 --> 01:40:21.810
<v Speaker 1>I was like 27,</v>
<v Speaker 1>28.</v>

2090
01:40:21.870 --> 01:40:23.430
<v Speaker 1>oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2091
01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:25.350
<v Speaker 1>So look like death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2092
01:40:25.351 --> 01:40:28.170
<v Speaker 1>I looked like concentrAtion camp deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2093
01:40:28.290 --> 01:40:31.200
<v Speaker 1>And it was just malabsorption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I couldn't absorb anything.</v>

2094
01:40:31.201 --> 01:40:34.950
<v Speaker 1>I was shoveling food down and for me at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that point it was a high,</v>

2095
01:40:34.980 --> 01:40:38.190
<v Speaker 1>it was a grain and legume based kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a vegan diet,</v>

2096
01:40:38.191 --> 01:40:42.750
<v Speaker 1>which for me was just not working for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that point in my life.</v>

2097
01:40:43.290 --> 01:40:48.290
<v Speaker 1>Living in seattle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not having any sun like that was a </v>

2098
01:40:48.290 --> 01:40:48.290
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really bad move forming it.</v>

2099
01:40:48.290 --> 01:40:52.850
<v Speaker 1>But I will say this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was also on the heels of getting </v>

2100
01:40:52.850 --> 01:40:54.190
<v Speaker 1>and resolving at least to degree grd.</v>

2101
01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:58.330
<v Speaker 4>So I think that parasitic infection,</v>
<v Speaker 4>low vitamin d levels,</v>

2102
01:40:58.360 --> 01:41:01.180
<v Speaker 4>bad sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad circadian rhythm,</v>

2103
01:41:01.540 --> 01:41:04.420
<v Speaker 4>like all that stuff fed into it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so for combination there.</v>

2104
01:41:04.510 --> 01:41:09.510
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want to get taken down at the </v>

2105
01:41:09.510 --> 01:41:09.640
<v Speaker 4>necaps that was a good way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And to cure giardia,</v>

2106
01:41:09.641 --> 01:41:12.130
<v Speaker 4>what did they give you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Might trinitas hall,</v>

2107
01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:17.220
<v Speaker 4>which is a antimicrobial that they use </v>
<v Speaker 4>for things like grd and then also some </v>

2108
01:41:18.221 --> 01:41:21.050
<v Speaker 4>of the rk bactor bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

2109
01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:24.040
<v Speaker 4>so these kind of parasitic bacteria type</v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

2110
01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:26.620
<v Speaker 4>And does that have an effect on </v>
<v Speaker 4>mitochondria as well?</v>

2111
01:41:26.621 --> 01:41:29.590
<v Speaker 4>The same way the antibiotics do I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not the same way,</v>

2112
01:41:29.591 --> 01:41:31.960
<v Speaker 4>but it is a mitochondrial disruptor as </v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

2113
01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:32.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

2114
01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:37.210
<v Speaker 4>what is a pro mitochondria supplement?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is there anything then?</v>

2115
01:41:37.660 --> 01:41:40.780
<v Speaker 4>so like resveratrol,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fasting,</v>

2116
01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:46.920
<v Speaker 4>ketosis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those things all tend to flip some </v>

2117
01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:48.820
<v Speaker 4>switches in the mitochondria that make </v>
<v Speaker 4>them healthier and more robust,</v>

2118
01:41:49.390 --> 01:41:54.340
<v Speaker 4>variable varying things rather on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>reservoir trawl being absorbable,</v>

2119
01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:57.280
<v Speaker 4>it's very difficult to absorb it.</v>

2120
01:41:57.520 --> 01:41:58.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2121
01:41:58.900 --> 01:42:01.120
<v Speaker 4>What is the best way?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm usually,</v>

2122
01:42:01.121 --> 01:42:04.150
<v Speaker 4>it's some sort of an emulsification with</v>
<v Speaker 4>fat and,</v>

2123
01:42:04.151 --> 01:42:05.050
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2124
01:42:05.051 --> 01:42:08.170
<v Speaker 4>life realized and so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's quite fat soluble.</v>

2125
01:42:08.171 --> 01:42:10.480
<v Speaker 4>So if you can get it mixed into a fatty </v>
<v Speaker 4>matrix,</v>

2126
01:42:10.481 --> 01:42:13.060
<v Speaker 4>then it enhances the absorption.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it does seem to.</v>

2127
01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:14.170
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

2128
01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:17.470
<v Speaker 4>most of this data is petri dish type </v>
<v Speaker 4>data,</v>

2129
01:42:17.471 --> 01:42:22.471
<v Speaker 4>so we really don't know if it's having </v>
<v Speaker 4>great effect in the body and then </v>

2130
01:42:22.471 --> 01:42:27.300
<v Speaker 4>there's another layer to this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A Ton of these polyphenolics don't </v>

2131
01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:30.280
<v Speaker 4>really enter the body or they don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>enter the body as the original chemical.</v>

2132
01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:35.550
<v Speaker 4>They get modified by the gut bacteria </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then either the gut bacteria </v>

2133
01:42:35.550 --> 01:42:39.721
<v Speaker 4>manufacturer completely different </v>
<v Speaker 4>chemical or some sort of downstream </v>

2134
01:42:39.721 --> 01:42:43.020
<v Speaker 4>chemical is what enters the body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or it may just interface with the gut </v>

2135
01:42:43.020 --> 01:42:46.831
<v Speaker 4>lining and then the gut sends out </v>
<v Speaker 4>different signaling molecules that then </v>

2136
01:42:46.831 --> 01:42:46.831
<v Speaker 4>affects the rest of the body.</v>

2137
01:42:46.831 --> 01:42:51.780
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it depends upon the healthiness of </v>

2138
01:42:51.780 --> 01:42:54.631
<v Speaker 4>your gut bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It that's a massive impact.</v>

2139
01:42:54.990 --> 01:42:59.990
<v Speaker 4>it has a massive impact on whether or </v>
<v Speaker 4>not that [inaudible] or other similar </v>

2140
01:42:59.990 --> 01:43:01.060
<v Speaker 4>nutrients get an just pharmaceuticals in</v>
<v Speaker 4>general.</v>

2141
01:43:01.061 --> 01:43:03.580
<v Speaker 4>Like when you look at people going on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>heart med or you know,</v>

2142
01:43:03.581 --> 01:43:08.581
<v Speaker 4>different things like depending what </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that their understanding is </v>

2143
01:43:08.581 --> 01:43:11.731
<v Speaker 4>not only do we have genetic differences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the differences in the gut </v>

2144
01:43:11.731 --> 01:43:14.500
<v Speaker 4>microbiome may have a really profound </v>
<v Speaker 4>influence in the way that people respond</v>

2145
01:43:14.501 --> 01:43:16.840
<v Speaker 4>to supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pharmaceuticals,</v>

2146
01:43:16.841 --> 01:43:17.800
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2147
01:43:18.070 --> 01:43:23.070
<v Speaker 4>It's just so much to take in for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>person and the average person is </v>

2148
01:43:23.070 --> 01:43:25.420
<v Speaker 4>listening to this that wants to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>optimize their health.</v>

2149
01:43:27.190 --> 01:43:29.410
<v Speaker 4>There's so many.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There should Be like.</v>

2150
01:43:29.620 --> 01:43:34.620
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess it's a lot of this is because </v>

2151
01:43:34.620 --> 01:43:37.471
<v Speaker 4>this is a fairly new discipline in terms</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the last few decades and guys like </v>

2152
01:43:37.471 --> 01:43:37.750
<v Speaker 4>you who are on the forefront of it.</v>

2153
01:43:37.750 --> 01:43:41.260
<v Speaker 4>I've done some person and chris kresser </v>
<v Speaker 4>who's gone through his own deal.</v>

2154
01:43:41.470 --> 01:43:46.470
<v Speaker 4>He was a macrobiotic vegan point in time</v>
<v Speaker 4>and now he tells you to eat liver and,</v>

2155
01:43:46.700 --> 01:43:48.670
<v Speaker 4>and you and you should see pictures of </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2156
01:43:48.690 --> 01:43:53.690
<v Speaker 4>He ended up getting a really nasty gut </v>
<v Speaker 4>bug in I think the Philippines and um,</v>

2157
01:43:54.590 --> 01:43:59.060
<v Speaker 4>pictures of him before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like jacked super thick legs,</v>

2158
01:43:59.061 --> 01:44:04.061
<v Speaker 4>like thick neck tie boxer and now he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty wavy and he's never really been </v>

2159
01:44:04.061 --> 01:44:07.760
<v Speaker 4>able to put all the weight back on and </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of get back to is as robust as what</v>

2160
01:44:07.761 --> 01:44:11.450
<v Speaker 4>he was before that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it was another situation where maybe</v>

2161
01:44:11.451 --> 01:44:16.451
<v Speaker 4>some irritation to the gut because of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the diet and indefinitely this </v>

2162
01:44:16.451 --> 01:44:17.780
<v Speaker 4>infectious agent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever the bug was that he caught,</v>

2163
01:44:17.781 --> 01:44:22.781
<v Speaker 4>just crushed him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There should be some sort of a place </v>

2164
01:44:22.781 --> 01:44:24.860
<v Speaker 4>that you could go like a string of </v>
<v Speaker 4>places,</v>

2165
01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:30.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you can open them up in major </v>

2166
01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:32.060
<v Speaker 4>cities and metropolitan areas where </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone can go and find out like what is</v>

2167
01:44:32.061 --> 01:44:32.990
<v Speaker 4>the right stuff to do?</v>

2168
01:44:33.020 --> 01:44:38.020
<v Speaker 4>I went to this one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they did some blood work on me and the </v>

2169
01:44:38.020 --> 01:44:38.960
<v Speaker 4>lady told me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>avocados just don't agree with you.</v>

2170
01:44:38.961 --> 01:44:40.220
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck off.</v>

2171
01:44:40.630 --> 01:44:42.560
<v Speaker 4>That is so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>TheRe's not a god I've.</v>

2172
01:44:42.650 --> 01:44:44.630
<v Speaker 4>I eat avocados all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're great.</v>

2173
01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:49.220
<v Speaker 4>There's just trying to come up with some</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of ridiculous blood test that shows</v>

2174
01:44:49.221 --> 01:44:50.240
<v Speaker 4>the avocados.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2175
01:44:50.270 --> 01:44:51.320
<v Speaker 4>that's not real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2176
01:44:51.410 --> 01:44:52.460
<v Speaker 4>That can't be real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can it?</v>

2177
01:44:52.610 --> 01:44:57.530
<v Speaker 4>There's not much again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that stuff gets really.</v>

2178
01:44:57.950 --> 01:45:00.530
<v Speaker 4>Especially avocado.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it's like damn avocado.</v>

2179
01:45:00.540 --> 01:45:05.210
<v Speaker 4>So if somebody has intestinal </v>
<v Speaker 4>permeability of for whatever reason,</v>

2180
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:10.270
<v Speaker 4>then you can become reactive unlike the </v>
<v Speaker 4>igg antibody testing.</v>

2181
01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:15.700
<v Speaker 4>But it does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the problem is not the food </v>

2182
01:45:15.700 --> 01:45:19.031
<v Speaker 4>specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is that you have gut </v>

2183
01:45:19.031 --> 01:45:19.400
<v Speaker 4>permeability,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if they fix that gut permeability,</v>

2184
01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:24.760
<v Speaker 4>then you're no longer really going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>react to the food because the food </v>

2185
01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:24.760
<v Speaker 4>doesn't get into your body.</v>

2186
01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:29.440
<v Speaker 4>Then you break it down into the protein,</v>
<v Speaker 4>into the amino acids and fatty acids in </v>

2187
01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:34.210
<v Speaker 4>the the constituent carbs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so the immunogenic properties that </v>

2188
01:45:34.210 --> 01:45:36.260
<v Speaker 4>it had before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't really matter because it's in your</v>

2189
01:45:36.261 --> 01:45:38.300
<v Speaker 4>gut and when the contents are inside to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get.</v>

2190
01:45:38.301 --> 01:45:43.301
<v Speaker 4>It's outside the body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is there any test that they can do with </v>

2191
01:45:43.301 --> 01:45:48.100
<v Speaker 4>your blood that would show that in any </v>
<v Speaker 4>way and is there any way that avocados,</v>

2192
01:45:48.890 --> 01:45:53.890
<v Speaker 4>one of the healthiest food known to man </v>
<v Speaker 4>could possibly be something you should </v>

2193
01:45:53.890 --> 01:45:56.440
<v Speaker 4>avoid?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Avocados are a not uncommon allergens,</v>

2194
01:45:56.441 --> 01:46:01.441
<v Speaker 4>so some people do develop allergies to </v>
<v Speaker 4>avocado seed essentially with that fruit</v>

2195
01:46:02.751 --> 01:46:07.751
<v Speaker 4>around it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there are some immunogenic proteins </v>

2196
01:46:07.751 --> 01:46:11.021
<v Speaker 4>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would have a pretty obvious reaction </v>

2197
01:46:11.021 --> 01:46:11.021
<v Speaker 4>than if you were allergic to chocolate </v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

2198
01:46:11.021 --> 01:46:15.370
<v Speaker 4>and this is where the reaction wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>be grabbing another chip and dip it in </v>

2199
01:46:15.370 --> 01:46:15.370
<v Speaker 4>the guacamole.</v>

2200
01:46:15.370 --> 01:46:15.950
<v Speaker 4>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2201
01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:19.750
<v Speaker 4>and usually it's something like foggy </v>
<v Speaker 4>headedness or a gi issue or you know,</v>

2202
01:46:19.770 --> 01:46:21.980
<v Speaker 4>like joint creakiness or something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2203
01:46:22.170 --> 01:46:24.160
<v Speaker 4>Creakiness the joints actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>physically make.</v>

2204
01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:26.520
<v Speaker 4>They just don't feel so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2205
01:46:26.850 --> 01:46:28.730
<v Speaker 4>So it feels like they're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2206
01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:34.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about sugar causes that </v>

2207
01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:34.040
<v Speaker 4>inflammation?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because that is a big factor with people</v>

2208
01:46:34.041 --> 01:46:37.370
<v Speaker 4>that have injuries even if it's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>injuries,</v>

2209
01:46:37.371 --> 01:46:41.120
<v Speaker 4>if they have joint pain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like knee pains,</v>

2210
01:46:41.121 --> 01:46:46.121
<v Speaker 4>back pains.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had this conversation with people </v>

2211
01:46:46.121 --> 01:46:46.121
<v Speaker 4>and I got it from a chiropractor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She said,</v>

2212
01:46:46.121 --> 01:46:47.990
<v Speaker 4>believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like gluten insensitivity,</v>

2213
01:46:47.991 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 4>just reducing gluten and becoming gluten</v>

2214
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:55.010
<v Speaker 1>free will change the way injuries hurt </v>
<v Speaker 1>like back injuries.</v>

2215
01:46:55.051 --> 01:46:57.540
<v Speaker 1>And I thought well that sounds like some</v>
<v Speaker 1>hippie bullshit.</v>

2216
01:46:57.870 --> 01:47:02.870
<v Speaker 1>And so this was many years ago when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>started getting into this idea of </v>

2217
01:47:02.870 --> 01:47:06.351
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory foods that are affecting </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way your body and your joints </v>

2218
01:47:06.351 --> 01:47:09.321
<v Speaker 1>particular field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she only took it to the point of </v>

2219
01:47:09.321 --> 01:47:09.321
<v Speaker 1>gluten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2220
01:47:09.321 --> 01:47:11.550
<v Speaker 1>And then it wasn't a sugar thing for </v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

2221
01:47:11.580 --> 01:47:13.410
<v Speaker 1>And then once I started looking into </v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar,</v>

2222
01:47:13.411 --> 01:47:13.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2223
01:47:13.801 --> 01:47:16.200
<v Speaker 1>these are all foods that cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation.</v>

2224
01:47:16.350 --> 01:47:17.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is happening?</v>

2225
01:47:17.790 --> 01:47:19.610
<v Speaker 1>What causes it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2226
01:47:19.710 --> 01:47:23.070
<v Speaker 1>How does sugar or high sugar processed </v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar diet,</v>

2227
01:47:23.190 --> 01:47:26.880
<v Speaker 1>how does that cause inflammation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a couple of different mechanisms that</v>

2228
01:47:26.881 --> 01:47:31.881
<v Speaker 1>can happen here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We we definitely understand that the </v>

2229
01:47:31.881 --> 01:47:34.530
<v Speaker 1>sugar can feed bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both good and bad bacteria.</v>

2230
01:47:34.590 --> 01:47:39.240
<v Speaker 1>If most of the bacterial masto should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>occurring in the colon,</v>

2231
01:47:39.241 --> 01:47:44.241
<v Speaker 1>like pretty far south,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if we eat a diet that's really </v>

2232
01:47:44.241 --> 01:47:45.540
<v Speaker 1>deficient in fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high in refined carbohydrates,</v>

2233
01:47:46.050 --> 01:47:50.820
<v Speaker 1>all carbohydrates get absorbed early and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's not actually any food for the</v>

2234
01:47:50.821 --> 01:47:52.740
<v Speaker 1>bacteria that should be living in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>colon.</v>

2235
01:47:53.130 --> 01:47:56.970
<v Speaker 1>So these bacteria tend to move more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more upward in the gi tract.</v>

2236
01:47:56.971 --> 01:47:59.460
<v Speaker 1>And this is where we get small </v>
<v Speaker 1>intestinal bacterial overgrowth.</v>

2237
01:47:59.910 --> 01:48:04.910
<v Speaker 1>Sibo is a pro inflammatory process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's one way that we can get </v>

2238
01:48:04.981 --> 01:48:09.981
<v Speaker 1>inflammation out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another way is just when we get really </v>

2239
01:48:09.981 --> 01:48:13.671
<v Speaker 1>wild swings in blood sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that tends to be a pro inflammatory </v>

2240
01:48:13.671 --> 01:48:15.720
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just the upregulation of insulin,</v>

2241
01:48:15.721 --> 01:48:20.721
<v Speaker 1>particularly if it's over a chronic </v>
<v Speaker 1>process that can be a pro inflammatory </v>

2242
01:48:20.721 --> 01:48:22.060
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other pieces,</v>

2243
01:48:22.090 --> 01:48:27.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you start getting cortisol released </v>

2244
01:48:27.090 --> 01:48:29.271
<v Speaker 1>in response to blood sugar crashes </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you get hypoglycemic and you're </v>

2245
01:48:29.271 --> 01:48:31.170
<v Speaker 1>trying to ping the liver to release some</v>
<v Speaker 1>more glucose,</v>

2246
01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:33.740
<v Speaker 1>that can be a pro inflammatory </v>
<v Speaker 1>processes,</v>

2247
01:48:33.780 --> 01:48:36.660
<v Speaker 1>the inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the physical reaction?</v>

2248
01:48:36.661 --> 01:48:38.730
<v Speaker 1>Like what is happening when you say </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation?</v>

2249
01:48:38.731 --> 01:48:41.460
<v Speaker 1>So there's a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>mediators there,</v>

2250
01:48:41.461 --> 01:48:43.440
<v Speaker 1>so you've got different cytokines.</v>

2251
01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:48.440
<v Speaker 1>These chemicals like interleukin one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interleukin six that are turning on </v>

2252
01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:52.701
<v Speaker 1>typically immune cells and then other </v>
<v Speaker 1>cells in the body are being effected as </v>

2253
01:48:52.701 --> 01:48:57.081
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's usually some sort of immune </v>

2254
01:48:57.081 --> 01:48:59.010
<v Speaker 1>cell response which then they in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>process and doing what they do,</v>

2255
01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:01.410
<v Speaker 1>they tend to release chemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cytokines,</v>

2256
01:49:01.411 --> 01:49:05.640
<v Speaker 1>and in similar chemicals that it can </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn into a feed forward mechanism.</v>

2257
01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:06.690
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2258
01:49:06.691 --> 01:49:11.691
<v Speaker 1>it's ultimately chemical messaging that </v>
<v Speaker 1>can turn on other inflammatory processes</v>

2259
01:49:13.231 --> 01:49:16.890
<v Speaker 1>in cells that are nearby and also the </v>
<v Speaker 1>immune cells themselves.</v>

2260
01:49:17.610 --> 01:49:22.610
<v Speaker 1>So that is causing these joints to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>painful and then back to the joint.</v>

2261
01:49:23.821 --> 01:49:26.220
<v Speaker 1>So whenever we do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any type of workout,</v>

2262
01:49:26.550 --> 01:49:27.990
<v Speaker 1>even just exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2263
01:49:27.991 --> 01:49:32.991
<v Speaker 1>So this is important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>important point to make to inflammation </v>

2264
01:49:32.991 --> 01:49:36.020
<v Speaker 1>in and of itself isn't necessarily bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the amount and type and placement </v>

2265
01:49:36.020 --> 01:49:40.341
<v Speaker 1>and all that type of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So exercise is a proinflammatory </v>

2266
01:49:40.341 --> 01:49:42.480
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what we call a hormetic stress.</v>

2267
01:49:42.870 --> 01:49:47.500
<v Speaker 1>So we get a little bit of this stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideally an appropriate dose and the body</v>

2268
01:49:47.501 --> 01:49:48.100
<v Speaker 1>senses</v>

2269
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:53.100
<v Speaker 4>this stress and then it makes us </v>
<v Speaker 4>stronger so that we can cope with a </v>

2270
01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:56.750
<v Speaker 4>subsequent exposure to this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if our sYstem is already pro </v>

2271
01:49:56.750 --> 01:50:00.280
<v Speaker 4>inflamed from poor diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>inadequate sleep,</v>

2272
01:50:00.340 --> 01:50:02.230
<v Speaker 4>gut permeability,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what have you,</v>

2273
01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:03.850
<v Speaker 4>than these little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2274
01:50:03.851 --> 01:50:08.851
<v Speaker 4>tears and bumps and bruises and </v>
<v Speaker 4>adhesions that we get from physical </v>

2275
01:50:08.851 --> 01:50:12.241
<v Speaker 4>activity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they never really heal because our body </v>

2276
01:50:12.241 --> 01:50:15.361
<v Speaker 4>is allocating resources to deal with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>inflammation in the gut and are kind of </v>

2277
01:50:15.361 --> 01:50:19.560
<v Speaker 4>over hyped up inflammatory response and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't have the resources to deal </v>

2278
01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:22.630
<v Speaker 4>with the inflammation in our joints and </v>
<v Speaker 4>our muscles and whatnot.</v>

2279
01:50:23.020 --> 01:50:23.890
<v Speaker 4>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>

2280
01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:29.070
<v Speaker 4>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are the best anti inflammatories </v>

2281
01:50:29.070 --> 01:50:30.460
<v Speaker 4>supplements or foods that people can </v>
<v Speaker 4>take?</v>

2282
01:50:30.461 --> 01:50:35.461
<v Speaker 4>Because ibuprofen is something you </v>
<v Speaker 4>should pretty clearly avoid now using </v>

2283
01:50:35.710 --> 01:50:37.050
<v Speaker 4>sparingly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2284
01:50:37.051 --> 01:50:42.051
<v Speaker 4>and this is for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for people that are not listening or </v>

2285
01:50:42.051 --> 01:50:42.051
<v Speaker 4>that are listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are not aware,</v>

2286
01:50:42.051 --> 01:50:46.910
<v Speaker 4>it's been shown over the last few years </v>
<v Speaker 4>in particular that ibuprofen is exactly </v>

2287
01:50:47.561 --> 01:50:48.640
<v Speaker 4>pretty dangerous.</v>

2288
01:50:49.010 --> 01:50:49.780
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2289
01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:52.330
<v Speaker 4>and can cause a host heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2290
01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:57.340
<v Speaker 4>it increases like 60 percent of strokes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a good friend of mine,</v>

2291
01:50:57.341 --> 01:51:02.341
<v Speaker 4>cameron hanes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's a marathon runner and an ultra </v>

2292
01:51:02.341 --> 01:51:02.710
<v Speaker 4>marathon runner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You used to take it every day and he was</v>

2293
01:51:02.711 --> 01:51:03.880
<v Speaker 4>always in pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2294
01:51:03.970 --> 01:51:08.970
<v Speaker 4>And what was fascinating was I did a </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast with rhonda patrick where she </v>

2295
01:51:08.970 --> 01:51:10.570
<v Speaker 4>talked about the dangers of it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>talked about how horrible it is for your</v>

2296
01:51:10.571 --> 01:51:11.860
<v Speaker 4>gut bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2297
01:51:11.861 --> 01:51:16.861
<v Speaker 4>And that that could in fact be causing </v>
<v Speaker 4>the actual inflammation that you're </v>

2298
01:51:16.861 --> 01:51:19.951
<v Speaker 4>trying to fight with the ibuprofen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then this continual cycle and lupe got </v>

2299
01:51:19.951 --> 01:51:21.400
<v Speaker 4>him off of it and his Joint pain went </v>
<v Speaker 4>away.</v>

2300
01:51:21.450 --> 01:51:23.170
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which is just insane.</v>

2301
01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:25.240
<v Speaker 4>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how does this happen?</v>

2302
01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:30.440
<v Speaker 4>How does this guy has joint pain all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>time and he's taken ibuprofen for the </v>

2303
01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:33.871
<v Speaker 4>joint pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He thinks it's just a fact of life in </v>

2304
01:51:33.871 --> 01:51:33.871
<v Speaker 4>the joint.</v>

2305
01:51:33.871 --> 01:51:36.010
<v Speaker 4>Pain is an inflammatory process and he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking an anti inflammatory,</v>

2306
01:51:36.011 --> 01:51:36.760
<v Speaker 4>which you would think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2307
01:51:36.761 --> 01:51:38.690
<v Speaker 4>this is probably a win,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>

2308
01:51:38.710 --> 01:51:43.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the complexity is kind of kind of </v>

2309
01:51:43.710 --> 01:51:43.710
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

2310
01:51:43.710 --> 01:51:45.980
<v Speaker 4>and interestingly it seems to be gut </v>
<v Speaker 4>bacteria mediated.</v>

2311
01:51:46.780 --> 01:51:51.780
<v Speaker 4>Now what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when a person does have some sort </v>

2312
01:51:51.780 --> 01:51:54.601
<v Speaker 4>of an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a headache or some sort of a </v>

2313
01:51:54.601 --> 01:51:54.601
<v Speaker 4>swollen joint or some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some pain,</v>

2314
01:51:54.790 --> 01:51:58.180
<v Speaker 4>is there anything that you can take that</v>
<v Speaker 4>has anti inflammatory properties?</v>

2315
01:51:58.181 --> 01:52:00.070
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have the negative health </v>
<v Speaker 4>consequences,</v>

2316
01:52:00.260 --> 01:52:01.360
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And for me,</v>

2317
01:52:01.361 --> 01:52:02.560
<v Speaker 4>this is my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my own,</v>

2318
01:52:02.660 --> 01:52:05.620
<v Speaker 4>I'll maybe give you some of my own </v>
<v Speaker 4>triage with this stuff.</v>

2319
01:52:05.621 --> 01:52:10.621
<v Speaker 4>Like I had an l four l five disc injury </v>
<v Speaker 4>about 15 years ago doing crossfit at </v>

2320
01:52:10.621 --> 01:52:13.090
<v Speaker 4>crossfit hq of all places.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was pretty,</v>

2321
01:52:13.091 --> 01:52:14.830
<v Speaker 4>pretty catastrophic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

2322
01:52:15.380 --> 01:52:17.530
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was the disc bulging with?</v>

2323
01:52:17.531 --> 01:52:21.490
<v Speaker 4>So the first workout was 75 glute ham </v>
<v Speaker 4>sit ups,</v>

2324
01:52:21.610 --> 01:52:24.070
<v Speaker 4>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're on like a glute ham developer and</v>

2325
01:52:24.071 --> 01:52:26.230
<v Speaker 4>you're doing a super long range of </v>
<v Speaker 4>movement sit up.</v>

2326
01:52:26.770 --> 01:52:31.180
<v Speaker 4>And I ended up with abdo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like basically my stomach was inflamed.</v>

2327
01:52:31.181 --> 01:52:34.810
<v Speaker 4>It was inflamed for like 12 days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was about 13 days later.</v>

2328
01:52:34.811 --> 01:52:39.811
<v Speaker 4>We're pulling abdo abdo instead of </v>
<v Speaker 4>rhabdo like the rhabdomyolysis maya </v>

2329
01:52:39.811 --> 01:52:44.250
<v Speaker 4>licenses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you overtrain your body literally </v>

2330
01:52:44.250 --> 01:52:46.490
<v Speaker 4>starts breaking down your muscle tissues</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you had pick up your kidneys and you</v>

2331
01:52:46.491 --> 01:52:47.550
<v Speaker 4>can die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2332
01:52:47.570 --> 01:52:50.450
<v Speaker 4>so I had kind of a compartmental </v>
<v Speaker 4>syndrome with this.</v>

2333
01:52:50.451 --> 01:52:52.880
<v Speaker 4>It was just in the abs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was bad.</v>

2334
01:52:53.300 --> 01:52:56.480
<v Speaker 4>So my app is just overworked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your abs massively overworked.</v>

2335
01:52:56.481 --> 01:53:01.481
<v Speaker 4>I mean there was no up no ramp up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the first time I've seen this </v>

2336
01:53:01.481 --> 01:53:01.640
<v Speaker 4>movement and I did 75.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2337
01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:04.850
<v Speaker 4>it was ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm 12.</v>

2338
01:53:04.851 --> 01:53:07.580
<v Speaker 4>Thirteen days later we were supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>pull max dead lifts.</v>

2339
01:53:07.581 --> 01:53:11.870
<v Speaker 4>My abs were still not healed and I'd </v>
<v Speaker 4>like for 65 on the bar.</v>

2340
01:53:11.871 --> 01:53:14.630
<v Speaker 4>I was just passing my knees and my abs </v>
<v Speaker 4>just failed.</v>

2341
01:53:14.990 --> 01:53:17.420
<v Speaker 4>And so I had this like fluxion injury </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a lot of load.</v>

2342
01:53:17.450 --> 01:53:19.100
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a very precarious spot.</v>

2343
01:53:19.660 --> 01:53:23.090
<v Speaker 4>And I know for l five disc injury,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's bulging.</v>

2344
01:53:23.091 --> 01:53:25.910
<v Speaker 4>It's not ruptured,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if I don't mobilize,</v>

2345
01:53:25.911 --> 01:53:27.260
<v Speaker 4>if I sit too much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

2346
01:53:27.290 --> 01:53:30.230
<v Speaker 4>if my hip flexors get tight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it will get super cranky.</v>

2347
01:53:30.231 --> 01:53:35.231
<v Speaker 4>So I will get to spots,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if I'm working a lot where I have </v>

2348
01:53:35.231 --> 01:53:37.670
<v Speaker 4>to take some ibuprofen and all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have this injury still to this,</v>

2349
01:53:37.690 --> 01:53:40.040
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's way better in general,</v>

2350
01:53:40.041 --> 01:53:42.290
<v Speaker 4>but every once in a while I can piss it </v>
<v Speaker 4>off pretty good.</v>

2351
01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:44.300
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever used a reverse hyper?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2352
01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:45.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it definitely helps.</v>

2353
01:53:45.980 --> 01:53:47.490
<v Speaker 4>Definitely helps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean when I,</v>

2354
01:53:47.540 --> 01:53:50.510
<v Speaker 4>when I stay on my mobility maintenance </v>
<v Speaker 4>cycle,</v>

2355
01:53:50.660 --> 01:53:55.660
<v Speaker 4>I am good to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when I get super busy when I'm </v>

2356
01:53:55.660 --> 01:53:55.660
<v Speaker 4>traveling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2357
01:53:55.660 --> 01:53:59.951
<v Speaker 4>if I have to sleep in a weird bed or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like it's tends to be a </v>

2358
01:53:59.951 --> 01:54:01.490
<v Speaker 4>cumulative thing to adds up over like </v>
<v Speaker 4>two weeks.</v>

2359
01:54:01.550 --> 01:54:03.950
<v Speaker 4>And then I can get kind of a back flip </v>
<v Speaker 4>for people who,</v>

2360
01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:05.960
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone just asked about this on twitter</v>

2361
01:54:05.961 --> 01:54:10.961
<v Speaker 4>yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the reverse hypers and machine created </v>

2362
01:54:10.961 --> 01:54:13.301
<v Speaker 4>by a guy named louie simmons who is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>really famous power lifter and a </v>

2363
01:54:13.491 --> 01:54:16.790
<v Speaker 4>completely insane person who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want to listen to the podcast,</v>

2364
01:54:16.791 --> 01:54:19.790
<v Speaker 4>jamie and I did with him at his place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>west side barbell,</v>

2365
01:54:19.791 --> 01:54:24.791
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a fucking nut but genius in making </v>

2366
01:54:24.791 --> 01:54:26.540
<v Speaker 4>this machine that out allows active </v>
<v Speaker 4>decompression of the spine.</v>

2367
01:54:26.710 --> 01:54:28.220
<v Speaker 4>I'm a big fan of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2368
01:54:28.580 --> 01:54:31.640
<v Speaker 4>do you do any sort of spinal </v>
<v Speaker 4>decompression exercises?</v>

2369
01:54:32.370 --> 01:54:33.170
<v Speaker 4>So both,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2370
01:54:33.171 --> 01:54:34.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of the,</v>

2371
01:54:34.100 --> 01:54:36.740
<v Speaker 4>the inversion board and then also just </v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2372
01:54:36.741 --> 01:54:38.480
<v Speaker 4>hanging.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll actually use some,</v>

2373
01:54:38.750 --> 01:54:43.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>weight lifting straps and go out on a </v>

2374
01:54:43.750 --> 01:54:46.001
<v Speaker 4>pull up bar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hands together and it'll hang for like </v>

2375
01:54:46.001 --> 01:54:47.420
<v Speaker 4>three minutes at a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we'll get to rassic decompression and</v>

2376
01:54:47.421 --> 01:54:48.040
<v Speaker 4>then also.</v>

2377
01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:49.760
<v Speaker 4>So it's not grip dependent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2378
01:54:49.910 --> 01:54:51.470
<v Speaker 4>I do thAt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I do it with the grip.</v>

2379
01:54:51.471 --> 01:54:56.471
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I feel like for jujitsu and for </v>

2380
01:54:56.471 --> 01:54:56.471
<v Speaker 4>all the other things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need strong hand.</v>

2381
01:54:56.471 --> 01:54:56.990
<v Speaker 4>So I'll just kill two birds with one </v>
<v Speaker 4>stone.</v>

2382
01:54:57.030 --> 01:55:02.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For that I'm on wanting such a training </v>

2383
01:55:02.030 --> 01:55:03.620
<v Speaker 4>stimulus for loosening my thoracic </v>
<v Speaker 4>girdle and everything that it's gonna.</v>

2384
01:55:03.650 --> 01:55:08.650
<v Speaker 4>It's gonna wipe out my grip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My grip would fail way before I would </v>

2385
01:55:08.650 --> 01:55:09.580
<v Speaker 4>get that kind of thoracic opening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2386
01:55:09.740 --> 01:55:13.640
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever think maybe you should work</v>
<v Speaker 4>your grip to grip?</v>

2387
01:55:13.641 --> 01:55:15.130
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we're talking about it.</v>

2388
01:55:15.140 --> 01:55:17.900
<v Speaker 4>It's a fairly fat bar also that I have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2389
01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:21.350
<v Speaker 4>And so I'm just using that as a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>bit of a bridge for that,</v>

2390
01:55:21.351 --> 01:55:23.630
<v Speaker 4>but I mean like there's a real benefit </v>
<v Speaker 4>in having a federal bar,</v>

2391
01:55:23.631 --> 01:55:25.760
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2392
01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:26.650
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2393
01:55:26.850 --> 01:55:29.060
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can get strength from here rather as</v>

2394
01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:30.590
<v Speaker 4>strange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think again,</v>

2395
01:55:30.591 --> 01:55:31.880
<v Speaker 4>like this variety,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2396
01:55:31.881 --> 01:55:34.100
<v Speaker 4>like getting as much variety as </v>
<v Speaker 4>possIble.</v>

2397
01:55:34.101 --> 01:55:37.880
<v Speaker 4>I love rope climbs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if I had one pulling movement I was</v>

2398
01:55:37.881 --> 01:55:42.881
<v Speaker 4>going to use,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would probably be a rope climb like </v>

2399
01:55:42.881 --> 01:55:42.881
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>

2400
01:55:42.881 --> 01:55:44.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you get this unilateral movement</v>

2401
01:55:44.430 --> 01:55:46.050
<v Speaker 1>but you're also like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2402
01:55:46.051 --> 01:55:50.820
<v Speaker 1>you get pack involvement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lattes are rated the whole thing and and</v>

2403
01:55:50.821 --> 01:55:55.821
<v Speaker 1>as you pull it in it tends to look a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of the positions and the </v>

2404
01:55:55.821 --> 01:55:58.080
<v Speaker 1>strength in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>In jujitsu and so you also,</v>

2405
01:55:58.081 --> 01:56:00.630
<v Speaker 1>as part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can work these lock off says as part</v>

2406
01:56:00.631 --> 01:56:05.631
<v Speaker 1>of the the transition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me it just ends up getting more </v>

2407
01:56:05.631 --> 01:56:07.280
<v Speaker 1>development across my back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my arms,</v>

2408
01:56:07.300 --> 01:56:11.940
<v Speaker 1>my shoulders in one movement than I </v>
<v Speaker 1>could get from any other type of polling</v>

2409
01:56:12.150 --> 01:56:13.560
<v Speaker 1>activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

2410
01:56:13.561 --> 01:56:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

2411
01:56:13.910 --> 01:56:18.910
<v Speaker 2>as far as like lower back decompression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you ever do that one where you're </v>

2412
01:56:18.910 --> 01:56:21.260
<v Speaker 2>hanging from your waist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only from the waist down.</v>

2413
01:56:21.610 --> 01:56:26.610
<v Speaker 2>I love that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one seems to isolate the lower </v>

2414
01:56:26.610 --> 01:56:29.861
<v Speaker 2>spine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the name of that thing that we </v>

2415
01:56:29.861 --> 01:56:29.861
<v Speaker 2>have in the back?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie?</v>

2416
01:56:29.861 --> 01:56:32.330
<v Speaker 2>The one that does that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spinal decompression machine that we put</v>

2417
01:56:32.331 --> 01:56:33.920
<v Speaker 2>together back there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one with your feet,</v>

2418
01:56:34.010 --> 01:56:34.970
<v Speaker 2>the hangups thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2419
01:56:34.971 --> 01:56:39.971
<v Speaker 2>not the hangup one but the other one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one that you kinda looks like it </v>

2420
01:56:39.971 --> 01:56:43.961
<v Speaker 2>looks like a roman setup chair and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just for decompression and you </v>

2421
01:56:44.371 --> 01:56:49.371
<v Speaker 2>just leaned forward and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to target directly the lower </v>

2422
01:56:49.371 --> 01:56:51.110
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much better than just the ankle ones.</v>

2423
01:56:51.500 --> 01:56:54.380
<v Speaker 2>The ones from the ankle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like my legs are holding a little</v>

2424
01:56:54.381 --> 01:56:58.820
<v Speaker 2>too much and I'm hanging on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm controlling it a little too much.</v>

2425
01:56:58.821 --> 01:56:59.780
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas this one,</v>

2426
01:56:59.781 --> 01:57:01.160
<v Speaker 2>I can completely let go.</v>

2427
01:57:01.210 --> 01:57:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Well in some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

2428
01:57:03.390 --> 01:57:08.390
<v Speaker 1>the gravity boots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they were finding that people were </v>

2429
01:57:08.390 --> 01:57:10.591
<v Speaker 1>getting like laxity and their knees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the knees were giving away before </v>

2430
01:57:10.591 --> 01:57:11.110
<v Speaker 1>you really decompress the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>THat makes sense.</v>

2431
01:57:11.111 --> 01:57:12.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>

2432
01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:12.300
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2433
01:57:12.370 --> 01:57:14.020
<v Speaker 2>but also some of that lacks in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>knees.</v>

2434
01:57:14.021 --> 01:57:16.930
<v Speaker 2>Probably believed some knee pressure on </v>
<v Speaker 2>some folks as well.</v>

2435
01:57:16.931 --> 01:57:21.931
<v Speaker 2>Sort of like how shoulder hangs releases</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of shoulder pain and some people.</v>

2436
01:57:22.030 --> 01:57:22.320
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2437
01:57:22.410 --> 01:57:22.950
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2438
01:57:22.951 --> 01:57:24.000
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

2439
01:57:24.150 --> 01:57:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But back to your question about the,</v>

2440
01:57:27.350 --> 01:57:28.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any inflammatories,</v>

2441
01:57:28.951 --> 01:57:33.951
<v Speaker 1>like if I get a really spicy backflow or</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will do 800 milligrams of ibuprofen,</v>

2442
01:57:34.021 --> 01:57:39.021
<v Speaker 1>but I'll hit it once and then I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel any adverse effects because </v>

2443
01:57:39.021 --> 01:57:40.980
<v Speaker 1>you don't do it a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you feel like,</v>

2444
01:57:41.180 --> 01:57:43.440
<v Speaker 1>do you take it and then feel any health </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences?</v>

2445
01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:44.610
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2446
01:57:44.611 --> 01:57:49.611
<v Speaker 1>but I mean one of the primary health </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences as killing over from a </v>

2447
01:57:49.611 --> 01:57:49.611
<v Speaker 1>heart attack or stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2448
01:57:49.990 --> 01:57:54.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's one of those things where I've </v>

2449
01:57:54.990 --> 01:57:54.990
<v Speaker 1>played with it and once it gets in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2450
01:57:54.990 --> 01:57:57.810
<v Speaker 1>I can ice it and I can do stem and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff helps.</v>

2451
01:57:57.811 --> 01:57:58.830
<v Speaker 1>But it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2452
01:57:58.831 --> 01:58:03.540
<v Speaker 1>if I can get one targeted bolus of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of ibuprofen 800 milligrams,</v>

2453
01:58:03.541 --> 01:58:08.160
<v Speaker 1>I hit it once and it just drops it down </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

2454
01:58:08.220 --> 01:58:08.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2455
01:58:08.691 --> 01:58:13.691
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it changes the whole thing from being a </v>

2456
01:58:13.691 --> 01:58:16.161
<v Speaker 1>two day issue to like a 12 day issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise they'll just kind of </v>

2457
01:58:16.161 --> 01:58:17.970
<v Speaker 1>drag on and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've just gotten to a point where if</v>

2458
01:58:17.971 --> 01:58:21.280
<v Speaker 1>I really get myself into a bad spot with</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mobility or,</v>

2459
01:58:21.281 --> 01:58:23.340
<v Speaker 1>or just getting this thing pissed off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's like,</v>

2460
01:58:23.370 --> 01:58:24.810
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just got to do this.</v>

2461
01:58:24.810 --> 01:58:29.240
<v Speaker 1>But then beyond that there's this </v>
<v Speaker 1>product from a new chapter called ziflow</v>

2462
01:58:29.250 --> 01:58:32.820
<v Speaker 1>mend and it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really pretty slick as far as,</v>

2463
01:58:32.830 --> 01:58:35.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an anti inflammatory.</v>

2464
01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:36.900
<v Speaker 1>It pulls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2465
01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:39.240
<v Speaker 1>some ginger extract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Curcumin,</v>

2466
01:58:39.241 --> 01:58:42.040
<v Speaker 1>they do a super critical extract on</v>

2467
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:44.800
<v Speaker 4>it and that stuff is pretty legit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that can,</v>

2468
01:58:45.220 --> 01:58:50.220
<v Speaker 4>for a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I haven't found that it works as </v>

2469
01:58:50.220 --> 01:58:52.651
<v Speaker 4>well on that pain and inflammation </v>
<v Speaker 4>reduction when my back gets really </v>

2470
01:58:52.691 --> 01:58:57.691
<v Speaker 4>spicy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's pretty darn good in everything </v>

2471
01:58:57.691 --> 01:58:58.210
<v Speaker 4>that's in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could make some arguments.</v>

2472
01:58:58.240 --> 01:59:00.850
<v Speaker 4>It would be pretty beneficial over the </v>
<v Speaker 4>long haul.</v>

2473
01:59:00.851 --> 01:59:01.650
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's uh,</v>

2474
01:59:02.230 --> 01:59:03.440
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these uh,</v>

2475
01:59:03.610 --> 01:59:04.330
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cox,</v>

2476
01:59:04.331 --> 01:59:06.580
<v Speaker 4>two pathways modifiers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they,</v>

2477
01:59:06.650 --> 01:59:09.190
<v Speaker 4>it does it in a different way than what </v>
<v Speaker 4>the ibuprofen does.</v>

2478
01:59:09.220 --> 01:59:10.600
<v Speaker 4>Is it dose dependent?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2479
01:59:10.601 --> 01:59:15.601
<v Speaker 4>is there a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a point of diminishing returns </v>

2480
01:59:15.601 --> 01:59:16.600
<v Speaker 4>where you get 800 milligrams is like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>magic number for ibuprofen?</v>

2481
01:59:16.601 --> 01:59:18.110
<v Speaker 4>They say you shouldn't go over that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2482
01:59:18.190 --> 01:59:19.870
<v Speaker 4>But is it something like that with this </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff?</v>

2483
01:59:20.410 --> 01:59:21.700
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

2484
01:59:21.701 --> 01:59:26.701
<v Speaker 4>like they have a recommended dose on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I haven't really played around with </v>

2485
01:59:26.701 --> 01:59:30.001
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean everything usually has some </v>

2486
01:59:30.001 --> 01:59:30.001
<v Speaker 4>sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2487
01:59:30.001 --> 01:59:30.640
<v Speaker 4>kinetics like dose response curve with </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2488
01:59:30.640 --> 01:59:32.260
<v Speaker 4>So I would assume so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2489
01:59:32.290 --> 01:59:33.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what I was wondering.</v>

2490
01:59:33.251 --> 01:59:35.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if you took our hyper doses?</v>

2491
01:59:35.350 --> 01:59:40.350
<v Speaker 4>I haven't tried that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have not tried that because it's all </v>

2492
01:59:40.350 --> 01:59:40.350
<v Speaker 4>natural stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rigHt?</v>

2493
01:59:40.350 --> 01:59:44.120
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>curcumin is not really dangerous in </v>

2494
01:59:44.120 --> 01:59:44.120
<v Speaker 4>larger doses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it a,</v>

2495
01:59:44.120 --> 01:59:47.320
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about the tox toxicology on</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2496
01:59:47.321 --> 01:59:47.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2497
01:59:47.861 --> 01:59:49.030
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2498
01:59:51.100 --> 01:59:56.100
<v Speaker 4>just because it's natural doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>necessarily mean that it's non toxic </v>

2499
01:59:56.100 --> 01:59:56.800
<v Speaker 4>arsenic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2500
01:59:56.801 --> 01:59:58.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's,</v>

2501
01:59:58.330 --> 01:59:59.900
<v Speaker 4>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2502
01:59:59.970 --> 02:00:04.970
<v Speaker 4>I w that is an interesting idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't really thought about going </v>

2503
02:00:04.970 --> 02:00:05.370
<v Speaker 4>beyond what the recommended is on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2504
02:00:05.390 --> 02:00:08.710
<v Speaker 4>I would wonder if that would ramp it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Other than that,</v>

2505
02:00:08.711 --> 02:00:10.840
<v Speaker 4>what about aspirin?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Aspirin has some benefit.</v>

2506
02:00:11.140 --> 02:00:12.460
<v Speaker 4>Aspirin has some benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's.</v>

2507
02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:17.480
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of an interesting mixed bag </v>
<v Speaker 4>too late to take enough of it to get a </v>

2508
02:00:17.480 --> 02:00:21.301
<v Speaker 4>really potent effect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you would like if somebody had a </v>

2509
02:00:21.301 --> 02:00:21.430
<v Speaker 4>back spasm or something like that.</v>

2510
02:00:21.940 --> 02:00:24.100
<v Speaker 4>You're looking at the potential of gi </v>
<v Speaker 4>bleeding.</v>

2511
02:00:24.101 --> 02:00:26.160
<v Speaker 4>You have a really potent blood thinning </v>
<v Speaker 4>effects,</v>

2512
02:00:26.161 --> 02:00:30.370
<v Speaker 4>so I mean aspirins a little bit dodgy in</v>
<v Speaker 4>in that regard,</v>

2513
02:00:31.290 --> 02:00:34.780
<v Speaker 4>that really acute deal that you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're trying to manage,</v>

2514
02:00:34.781 --> 02:00:37.630
<v Speaker 4>but it is a possibly interesting side </v>
<v Speaker 4>note.</v>

2515
02:00:37.690 --> 02:00:41.890
<v Speaker 4>Aspirin like a baby aspirin a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some studies that have suggested</v>

2516
02:00:41.891 --> 02:00:44.920
<v Speaker 4>that women taking that baby aspirin a </v>
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>

2517
02:00:44.980 --> 02:00:49.980
<v Speaker 4>It could reduce breast cancer </v>
<v Speaker 4>potentiality by like 70 percent because </v>

2518
02:00:49.980 --> 02:00:52.000
<v Speaker 4>of the antiangiogenic effects of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>aspirin.</v>

2519
02:00:52.630 --> 02:00:57.630
<v Speaker 4>Now I've read some things about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ketogenic diet and cancer and that is </v>

2520
02:00:57.630 --> 02:00:59.890
<v Speaker 4>very fascinating to me about having </v>
<v Speaker 4>these high fat,</v>

2521
02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:04.150
<v Speaker 4>Low complex carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>low simple carbohydrate diets can have a</v>

2522
02:01:04.151 --> 02:01:08.980
<v Speaker 4>great benefit on reducing the fuel that </v>
<v Speaker 4>cancer needs to stay alive.</v>

2523
02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:12.690
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say it's at least twofold.</v>

2524
02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:16.330
<v Speaker 4>It's probably multifactorial there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but so on the one hand,</v>

2525
02:01:16.331 --> 02:01:21.331
<v Speaker 4>certain types of cancer tend to </v>
<v Speaker 4>preferentially run on glucose and so if </v>

2526
02:01:21.331 --> 02:01:25.531
<v Speaker 4>you can limit the glucose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't really do well with fats or </v>

2527
02:01:25.660 --> 02:01:28.720
<v Speaker 4>proteins as a fuel source,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you can limit that.</v>

2528
02:01:28.721 --> 02:01:30.520
<v Speaker 4>Not all cancers falling into this </v>
<v Speaker 4>category.</v>

2529
02:01:30.521 --> 02:01:35.521
<v Speaker 4>That was some cancers are super </v>
<v Speaker 4>metabolically flexible and they can use </v>

2530
02:01:35.521 --> 02:01:38.671
<v Speaker 4>just about anything as a fuel source,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there's a benefit for potentially </v>

2531
02:01:38.681 --> 02:01:39.620
<v Speaker 4>breast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>colon,</v>

2532
02:01:39.621 --> 02:01:40.430
<v Speaker 4>prostate,</v>

2533
02:01:40.610 --> 02:01:45.610
<v Speaker 1>glioblastoma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of other endothelial derived </v>

2534
02:01:45.610 --> 02:01:50.090
<v Speaker 1>cancers that just directly that </v>
<v Speaker 1>reduction in glucose level may be really</v>

2535
02:01:50.091 --> 02:01:55.091
<v Speaker 1>beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was another layer to it though </v>

2536
02:01:55.091 --> 02:01:58.480
<v Speaker 1>that that low glucose environment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that shift towards ketosis tends to set </v>

2537
02:01:59.151 --> 02:02:04.151
<v Speaker 1>up this kind of stress response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we actually have a little bit of </v>

2538
02:02:04.151 --> 02:02:06.380
<v Speaker 1>oxydative stress occurring in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mitochondria and normal tissue.</v>

2539
02:02:06.381 --> 02:02:09.350
<v Speaker 1>Do great with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but cancerous tissue does not,</v>

2540
02:02:09.380 --> 02:02:13.460
<v Speaker 1>so it's a little bit of an irritant and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing right now,</v>

2541
02:02:13.461 --> 02:02:18.461
<v Speaker 1>what they're studying is getting folks </v>
<v Speaker 1>ramped up on a ketogenic diet so that </v>

2542
02:02:18.461 --> 02:02:22.211
<v Speaker 1>you get that hormetic stress response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're limiting glucose and then they </v>

2543
02:02:22.211 --> 02:02:24.650
<v Speaker 1>will have people fast immediately before</v>
<v Speaker 1>chemo or radiation.</v>

2544
02:02:24.651 --> 02:02:27.020
<v Speaker 1>so this is still doing some conventional</v>
<v Speaker 1>therapies,</v>

2545
02:02:27.410 --> 02:02:30.830
<v Speaker 1>but that fasting state that while you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>also in ketosis,</v>

2546
02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:34.340
<v Speaker 1>it reduces your pool of this substance </v>
<v Speaker 1>called glutathione,</v>

2547
02:02:34.341 --> 02:02:37.190
<v Speaker 1>which is our normal antioxidant defense </v>
<v Speaker 1>network.</v>

2548
02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:39.770
<v Speaker 1>So interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe counterintuitively,</v>

2549
02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:44.800
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to reduce your </v>
<v Speaker 1>antioxidant pool and get it down to a </v>

2550
02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:48.641
<v Speaker 1>bare minimum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when they whack you and the cancer </v>

2551
02:02:48.641 --> 02:02:52.091
<v Speaker 1>with the chemo and the radiation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cancer is more prone to die because </v>

2552
02:02:52.091 --> 02:02:54.440
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have antioxidant defense </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms to keep it going.</v>

2553
02:02:54.470 --> 02:02:59.470
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting thing because a lot </v>

2554
02:02:59.470 --> 02:02:59.470
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2555
02:02:59.470 --> 02:03:01.800
<v Speaker 1>people in the kind of alternative cancer</v>
<v Speaker 1>treatment scene,</v>

2556
02:03:01.801 --> 02:03:06.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll start dosing people on super </v>

2557
02:03:06.801 --> 02:03:07.400
<v Speaker 1>high antioxidants with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thought that some of the etiology of</v>

2558
02:03:07.401 --> 02:03:09.640
<v Speaker 1>cancer may be driven by free radicals </v>
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

2559
02:03:09.660 --> 02:03:12.740
<v Speaker 1>by oxidative damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there may be some truth to that,</v>

2560
02:03:13.100 --> 02:03:18.100
<v Speaker 1>but it's kinda like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the horses out of the barn at this </v>

2561
02:03:18.100 --> 02:03:18.100
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of tackling it in the wrong</v>

2562
02:03:18.100 --> 02:03:21.380
<v Speaker 1>way and even when they're using high </v>
<v Speaker 1>dose vitamin c,</v>

2563
02:03:21.740 --> 02:03:26.740
<v Speaker 1>they're using it intravenously and even </v>
<v Speaker 1>though vitamin c is touted as an </v>

2564
02:03:26.740 --> 02:03:28.430
<v Speaker 1>antioxidant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be a pro oxidated high substances</v>

2565
02:03:28.431 --> 02:03:30.830
<v Speaker 1>and so are at high concentrations.</v>

2566
02:03:31.160 --> 02:03:36.160
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a situation where you get the </v>

2567
02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:39.010
<v Speaker 1>glutathione pool depleted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hit these people with high dose </v>

2568
02:03:39.010 --> 02:03:41.990
<v Speaker 1>vitamin c and then they maybe do </v>
<v Speaker 1>hyperbaric oxygen where they go into a,</v>

2569
02:03:42.050 --> 02:03:44.680
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pressurized canister and they,</v>

2570
02:03:44.690 --> 02:03:49.690
<v Speaker 1>they do pure co two and that increases </v>
<v Speaker 1>the oxidative stress and that may be </v>

2571
02:03:49.821 --> 02:03:54.821
<v Speaker 1>another adJunctive treatment to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's all of these different </v>

2572
02:03:54.821 --> 02:03:57.470
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms that are kind of an outgrowth</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the key to genic diet going on in the</v>

2573
02:03:57.471 --> 02:03:58.700
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2574
02:03:59.130 --> 02:04:04.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you mess around with cryotherapy at </v>

2575
02:04:04.130 --> 02:04:04.130
<v Speaker 1>all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a ton.</v>

2576
02:04:04.130 --> 02:04:04.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2577
02:04:04.130 --> 02:04:07.910
<v Speaker 1>I live on a little three acre farm and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a rino.</v>

2578
02:04:07.911 --> 02:04:11.910
<v Speaker 1>And so it's cold frequently and I have </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a tub of water and never once while</v>

2579
02:04:11.911 --> 02:04:14.480
<v Speaker 1>when I buy sack up I'll go out there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit in it.</v>

2580
02:04:14.540 --> 02:04:16.940
<v Speaker 1>But it's so cold water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like,</v>

2581
02:04:16.941 --> 02:04:18.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw ice in there anything.</v>

2582
02:04:18.410 --> 02:04:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's usually for much of the </v>

2583
02:04:23.410 --> 02:04:23.410
<v Speaker 1>year there's a little layer of ice on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the top of it.</v>

2584
02:04:23.410 --> 02:04:25.720
<v Speaker 1>And so I've got to like chisel that out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you climb in and out of climate</v>

2585
02:04:25.740 --> 02:04:27.500
<v Speaker 1>and measure the temperature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2586
02:04:27.501 --> 02:04:28.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2587
02:04:28.401 --> 02:04:33.401
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's somewhere slightly above freezing </v>

2588
02:04:33.401 --> 02:04:33.401
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2589
02:04:33.401 --> 02:04:34.130
<v Speaker 1>it's got an inch or two of ice on top of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2590
02:04:34.190 --> 02:04:36.770
<v Speaker 1>But after you add rhonda patrick on </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

2591
02:04:36.820 --> 02:04:38.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of opted</v>

2592
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:40.670
<v Speaker 4>more for the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a hot sauna kind of deal with this.</v>

2593
02:04:40.680 --> 02:04:41.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

2594
02:04:41.230 --> 02:04:46.230
<v Speaker 4>that's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's way easier than it seems really </v>

2595
02:04:46.230 --> 02:04:46.230
<v Speaker 4>positive here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2596
02:04:46.230 --> 02:04:49.461
<v Speaker 4>And I've been doing that after jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 4>and on the days when I can pull that </v>

2597
02:04:49.461 --> 02:04:50.430
<v Speaker 4>off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my recovery is amazing.</v>

2598
02:04:50.460 --> 02:04:55.460
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like I pressed the reset </v>
<v Speaker 4>button that day and although I got the </v>

2599
02:04:55.460 --> 02:04:57.810
<v Speaker 4>benefit of jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't have any of the downside.</v>

2600
02:04:58.180 --> 02:05:03.180
<v Speaker 4>It is crazy and I didn't experience that</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I would do a cryo immersions after </v>

2601
02:05:03.571 --> 02:05:05.940
<v Speaker 4>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I felt better kind of,</v>

2602
02:05:05.990 --> 02:05:08.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the first maybe hour or two after a</v>

2603
02:05:08.581 --> 02:05:12.390
<v Speaker 4>hard workout during the cold water </v>
<v Speaker 4>immersion,</v>

2604
02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:17.100
<v Speaker 4>but then a day or two later like I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>still sore and joint creaky and all that</v>

2605
02:05:17.101 --> 02:05:20.660
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas with the sauna you get,</v>

2606
02:05:20.890 --> 02:05:25.890
<v Speaker 4>it's not an infrared sauna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just like this hot as balls sought </v>

2607
02:05:25.890 --> 02:05:28.050
<v Speaker 4>140 degrees plus and I would sit in </v>
<v Speaker 4>there as long as I could 15,</v>

2608
02:05:28.051 --> 02:05:33.051
<v Speaker 4>20 minutes and man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wHen when I finally break and I want </v>

2609
02:05:33.051 --> 02:05:36.891
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like if there was an old person in </v>

2610
02:05:36.891 --> 02:05:38.120
<v Speaker 4>front of me getting out of there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would push them to panic.</v>

2611
02:05:38.220 --> 02:05:39.400
<v Speaker 4>Getting out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2612
02:05:39.780 --> 02:05:44.780
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is there a differentiation in your body </v>

2613
02:05:44.780 --> 02:05:47.931
<v Speaker 4>between a steam shower and a sauna?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when you get into one of those hot </v>

2614
02:05:48.001 --> 02:05:52.090
<v Speaker 4>steam showers and it's 135 degrees and </v>
<v Speaker 4>your data,</v>

2615
02:05:52.190 --> 02:05:54.140
<v Speaker 4>is it good because it's heat response,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2616
02:05:54.170 --> 02:05:56.700
<v Speaker 4>That's really what's going to spawn heat</v>
<v Speaker 4>shock proteins.</v>

2617
02:05:56.730 --> 02:05:58.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it did.</v>

2618
02:05:58.590 --> 02:06:01.720
<v Speaker 4>Rhonda patrick would know that one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do not know it.</v>

2619
02:06:01.721 --> 02:06:06.721
<v Speaker 4>It seems like for me that air can be </v>
<v Speaker 4>hotter in.</v>

2620
02:06:07.080 --> 02:06:12.080
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting though because water </v>
<v Speaker 4>can confers or,</v>

2621
02:06:12.091 --> 02:06:16.080
<v Speaker 4>or removes a heat like 30 times faster </v>
<v Speaker 4>than air does.</v>

2622
02:06:16.140 --> 02:06:17.190
<v Speaker 4>So like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2623
02:06:17.191 --> 02:06:22.191
<v Speaker 4>so um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could heat or cool the Body much </v>

2624
02:06:22.191 --> 02:06:22.191
<v Speaker 4>faster with water then you came with </v>
<v Speaker 4>eric clearly.</v>

2625
02:06:22.191 --> 02:06:23.910
<v Speaker 4>And so I'm wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2626
02:06:23.940 --> 02:06:28.940
<v Speaker 4>would you need water that's as hot as </v>
<v Speaker 4>the air to get the same type of </v>

2627
02:06:28.940 --> 02:06:32.490
<v Speaker 4>temperature elevation in your body or is</v>
<v Speaker 4>just the skin being exposed,</v>

2628
02:06:32.580 --> 02:06:35.640
<v Speaker 4>exposed to air temperature and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 4>an oven.</v>

2629
02:06:35.670 --> 02:06:40.670
<v Speaker 4>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there something kind of cool with </v>

2630
02:06:40.670 --> 02:06:40.670
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>

2631
02:06:40.670 --> 02:06:40.770
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a good question for that one too,</v>

2632
02:06:40.771 --> 02:06:41.480
<v Speaker 4>rhonda.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2633
02:06:41.520 --> 02:06:43.080
<v Speaker 4>I'll make a note of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2634
02:06:43.081 --> 02:06:44.010
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what about,</v>

2635
02:06:44.011 --> 02:06:47.500
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>other forms of recovery post workout and</v>

2636
02:06:47.530 --> 02:06:52.530
<v Speaker 4>found anything to be beneficial?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you messing around at all with like </v>

2637
02:06:52.530 --> 02:06:54.390
<v Speaker 4>those hard balls?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like those wad balls?</v>

2638
02:06:54.420 --> 02:06:56.520
<v Speaker 4>I do some stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>

2639
02:06:56.580 --> 02:07:01.580
<v Speaker 4>so I followed this gymnastics bodies </v>
<v Speaker 4>program that I wanted to ask you about </v>

2640
02:07:01.580 --> 02:07:01.580
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2641
02:07:01.580 --> 02:07:05.210
<v Speaker 4>And it's really good and they have so </v>
<v Speaker 4>they have the strength work as part of </v>

2642
02:07:05.281 --> 02:07:08.550
<v Speaker 4>this whole thing pressing and pulling </v>
<v Speaker 4>all kinds of trunk work and everything.</v>

2643
02:07:08.551 --> 02:07:12.480
<v Speaker 4>But each strength movement has a </v>
<v Speaker 4>mobility movement paired with it.</v>

2644
02:07:12.780 --> 02:07:17.780
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really interesting because as you </v>

2645
02:07:17.780 --> 02:07:20.211
<v Speaker 4>get stronger doing this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a tendency to get tighter so </v>

2646
02:07:20.211 --> 02:07:22.410
<v Speaker 4>they just kind of bake the mobility </v>
<v Speaker 4>movement into the cake with that.</v>

2647
02:07:22.860 --> 02:07:27.860
<v Speaker 4>But then they also have a three day a </v>
<v Speaker 4>week stretching sequence once the front </v>

2648
02:07:27.860 --> 02:07:27.860
<v Speaker 4>splits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once the side splits.</v>

2649
02:07:27.860 --> 02:07:30.960
<v Speaker 4>And then the other one is thoracic </v>
<v Speaker 4>mobility for like a back bend.</v>

2650
02:07:31.140 --> 02:07:36.140
<v Speaker 4>And so I just kind of punch the time </v>
<v Speaker 4>clock on that like each day have some </v>

2651
02:07:36.140 --> 02:07:38.620
<v Speaker 4>strength and mobility work that I do </v>
<v Speaker 4>with that three days a week.</v>

2652
02:07:38.621 --> 02:07:42.130
<v Speaker 4>I do the um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the dedicated stretching sequence,</v>

2653
02:07:42.131 --> 02:07:47.131
<v Speaker 4>I tend to do it with my daughters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like three and five and so we </v>

2654
02:07:47.131 --> 02:07:49.510
<v Speaker 4>just get into the floor and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just a shit show in there with them</v>

2655
02:07:49.511 --> 02:07:52.450
<v Speaker 4>also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a ton of fun and we'll hit that</v>

2656
02:07:52.451 --> 02:07:54.370
<v Speaker 4>like three days a week and that's been </v>
<v Speaker 4>really good.</v>

2657
02:07:54.520 --> 02:07:58.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm a meditation app,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like doing something like brainwave,</v>

2658
02:07:58.610 --> 02:08:03.610
<v Speaker 4>the binaural beats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm so wound tight and kind of type a </v>

2659
02:08:03.610 --> 02:08:05.770
<v Speaker 4>that if I can just like sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go outside,</v>

2660
02:08:05.830 --> 02:08:08.200
<v Speaker 4>look at the trees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do five minutes on that thing,</v>

2661
02:08:08.201 --> 02:08:09.790
<v Speaker 4>do some kind of cyclic breathing.</v>

2662
02:08:10.210 --> 02:08:12.610
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that is a really,</v>

2663
02:08:12.611 --> 02:08:16.060
<v Speaker 4>really good system reset for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you done any isolation tank work?</v>

2664
02:08:16.120 --> 02:08:18.850
<v Speaker 4>I have done some isolation take away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We tried to get me,</v>

2665
02:08:18.851 --> 02:08:23.851
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to go out to torrance last time when I </v>

2666
02:08:23.851 --> 02:08:24.190
<v Speaker 4>was here and I couldn't make it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've done that since I've done that.</v>

2667
02:08:24.220 --> 02:08:29.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So tell me what you've been doing and </v>

2668
02:08:29.220 --> 02:08:29.220
<v Speaker 4>how often.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't do it often.</v>

2669
02:08:29.220 --> 02:08:31.780
<v Speaker 4>It's usually when I'm traveling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is a place in reno now,</v>

2670
02:08:31.781 --> 02:08:35.190
<v Speaker 4>like it's just kind of getting into reno</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all over the country now.</v>

2671
02:08:35.370 --> 02:08:38.080
<v Speaker 4>it is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a guy apprOached me with a,</v>

2672
02:08:38.081 --> 02:08:39.610
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an idea for a,</v>

2673
02:08:39.700 --> 02:08:43.420
<v Speaker 4>a pretty legit business model around </v>
<v Speaker 4>this and we were kind of looking at some</v>

2674
02:08:43.421 --> 02:08:46.700
<v Speaker 4>people putting some money into it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then I heard that massage envy was going</v>

2675
02:08:46.701 --> 02:08:48.180
<v Speaker 4>to open up a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2676
02:08:48.810 --> 02:08:51.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the float tanks and they're everywhere.</v>

2677
02:08:51.580 --> 02:08:53.710
<v Speaker 4>Like there's massage envy on like every </v>
<v Speaker 4>corner.</v>

2678
02:08:53.711 --> 02:08:54.400
<v Speaker 4>And so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2679
02:08:54.570 --> 02:08:57.400
<v Speaker 4>data that backed out of that because you</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't think that it would be profitable</v>

2680
02:08:57.401 --> 02:09:00.980
<v Speaker 4>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it'd be really easy to get out</v>

2681
02:09:00.981 --> 02:09:04.180
<v Speaker 4>maneuvered by a multi offering,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of kind of,</v>

2682
02:09:04.480 --> 02:09:06.010
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that makes sense.</v>

2683
02:09:06.011 --> 02:09:08.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Massage and float all in one location.</v>

2684
02:09:08.840 --> 02:09:13.840
<v Speaker 4>And if they sell weed to float tanks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>plus weed is like the greatest thing in </v>

2685
02:09:14.441 --> 02:09:16.360
<v Speaker 4>the world for relaxation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2686
02:09:16.660 --> 02:09:17.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

2687
02:09:17.830 --> 02:09:22.600
<v Speaker 4>In reno now load Nevada is now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember on board with that Nevada.</v>

2688
02:09:22.870 --> 02:09:27.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The longest time to vita was one of the </v>

2689
02:09:27.870 --> 02:09:27.870
<v Speaker 4>strictest places in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You if you got caught with a joint,</v>

2690
02:09:27.870 --> 02:09:29.290
<v Speaker 4>you went to jail for something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>seven years.</v>

2691
02:09:29.291 --> 02:09:30.330
<v Speaker 4>It was really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>

2692
02:09:30.550 --> 02:09:34.480
<v Speaker 4>it's a interesting environment because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you have like brothels around there,</v>

2693
02:09:34.481 --> 02:09:39.481
<v Speaker 4>you have the gambling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then there was this pretty like </v>

2694
02:09:39.481 --> 02:09:39.481
<v Speaker 4>draconian approach to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2695
02:09:39.481 --> 02:09:43.910
<v Speaker 4>like really minor drug offenses that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they should be offensive at all is.</v>

2696
02:09:44.470 --> 02:09:46.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty ridiculous.</v>

2697
02:09:46.030 --> 02:09:51.030
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you messed around at all with cbd </v>

2698
02:09:51.030 --> 02:09:53.101
<v Speaker 4>oil or cbd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is non psychoactive but has </v>

2699
02:09:53.101 --> 02:09:53.880
<v Speaker 4>tremendous beneficial properties for </v>
<v Speaker 4>anti-inflammation?</v>

2700
02:09:54.040 --> 02:09:59.040
<v Speaker 4>I have not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's one of those things that's on </v>

2701
02:09:59.040 --> 02:09:59.040
<v Speaker 4>the list to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2702
02:09:59.040 --> 02:09:59.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get on that.</v>

2703
02:09:59.620 --> 02:10:04.620
<v Speaker 4>Because you would think that with </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone when I was asking you about a </v>

2704
02:10:04.620 --> 02:10:07.860
<v Speaker 4>anti-inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things like cbd apparently has profound </v>

2705
02:10:07.860 --> 02:10:08.020
<v Speaker 4>effects.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2706
02:10:08.021 --> 02:10:13.021
<v Speaker 4>what's interesting about cbd is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything that you would think is good </v>

2707
02:10:13.021 --> 02:10:16.180
<v Speaker 4>about kind of a paleo ketogenic diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sleeping well,</v>

2708
02:10:16.181 --> 02:10:17.410
<v Speaker 4>exercising,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2709
02:10:18.130 --> 02:10:23.130
<v Speaker 4>Cbd does it effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now it doesn't work the sAme in every </v>

2710
02:10:23.130 --> 02:10:24.640
<v Speaker 4>single person and you need to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>play around with that.</v>

2711
02:10:24.641 --> 02:10:29.641
<v Speaker 4>So there's some caveats with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you just look at the </v>

2712
02:10:29.641 --> 02:10:32.671
<v Speaker 4>pharmacology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look at the research on it and you </v>

2713
02:10:32.671 --> 02:10:33.130
<v Speaker 4>look at all this other cool stuff that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>been done,</v>

2714
02:10:33.530 --> 02:10:34.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by,</v>

2715
02:10:34.190 --> 02:10:38.690
<v Speaker 4>by dietary interventions elsewhere in </v>
<v Speaker 4>lifestyle interventions.</v>

2716
02:10:38.690 --> 02:10:42.080
<v Speaker 4>Then the cbd oil hits all of those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those pieces.</v>

2717
02:10:42.081 --> 02:10:44.990
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of amazing that that plant was</v>

2718
02:10:44.991 --> 02:10:49.991
<v Speaker 4>illegal for so long and still isn't a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of places and still it's federally </v>

2719
02:10:49.991 --> 02:10:53.201
<v Speaker 4>and there's so many benefits to it in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>non psychoactive benefits folks doesn't </v>

2720
02:10:53.201 --> 02:10:54.790
<v Speaker 4>have anything to do with your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2721
02:10:54.800 --> 02:10:57.710
<v Speaker 4>you just want an excuse to goodheart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hard fucking loser.</v>

2722
02:10:58.010 --> 02:11:01.040
<v Speaker 4>That really doesn't even get you high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cbd is don't do a damn thing.</v>

2723
02:11:01.041 --> 02:11:04.220
<v Speaker 4>It does apparently alleviate anxiety and</v>
<v Speaker 4>some breaks,</v>

2724
02:11:04.490 --> 02:11:05.720
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2725
02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:11.280
<v Speaker 4>How much oF that is anxiety is dependent</v>
<v Speaker 4>or caused by inflammation?</v>

2726
02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:17.320
<v Speaker 4>They just had some great studies that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're looking at a alterations in gut </v>

2727
02:11:17.320 --> 02:11:20.990
<v Speaker 4>microbiome and inflammatory status and </v>
<v Speaker 4>depression and anxiety.</v>

2728
02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:26.080
<v Speaker 4>And it was basically if they shifted </v>
<v Speaker 4>things such that the gut microbiome </v>

2729
02:11:26.080 --> 02:11:29.381
<v Speaker 4>looked healthier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the depression anxiety basically </v>

2730
02:11:29.381 --> 02:11:29.381
<v Speaker 4>disappeared and then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2731
02:11:29.381 --> 02:11:29.720
<v Speaker 4>it could shift the other way.</v>

2732
02:11:29.720 --> 02:11:32.660
<v Speaker 4>And it's interesting again where if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>add something,</v>

2733
02:11:33.020 --> 02:11:35.220
<v Speaker 4>so not everybody's going to change her </v>
<v Speaker 4>diet and,</v>

2734
02:11:35.221 --> 02:11:37.970
<v Speaker 4>and like I advocate for that and push </v>
<v Speaker 4>and shove,</v>

2735
02:11:37.971 --> 02:11:42.971
<v Speaker 4>but the reality is like our world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's sent up and incentivized to not do </v>

2736
02:11:42.971 --> 02:11:47.951
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the big junk food manufacturers </v>

2737
02:11:47.951 --> 02:11:48.410
<v Speaker 4>they study how to make this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>addictive.</v>

2738
02:11:48.411 --> 02:11:51.770
<v Speaker 4>Like what's the laY's potato chip line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can't eat just one.</v>

2739
02:11:51.771 --> 02:11:52.250
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2740
02:11:52.251 --> 02:11:57.251
<v Speaker 4>I'll take that thing to the bank all day</v>
<v Speaker 4>long so you can ridicule people fat,</v>

2741
02:11:57.801 --> 02:11:58.790
<v Speaker 4>shame,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do all this stuff.</v>

2742
02:11:58.791 --> 02:12:03.791
<v Speaker 4>But there's a reality that our modern </v>
<v Speaker 4>world is set up to work exactly against </v>

2743
02:12:03.791 --> 02:12:05.930
<v Speaker 4>our genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what do we do then?</v>

2744
02:12:05.931 --> 02:12:10.931
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could have something like cbd oil </v>

2745
02:12:10.931 --> 02:12:12.911
<v Speaker 4>where you put it in a little bite of </v>
<v Speaker 4>chocolate and the person has one or two </v>

2746
02:12:12.911 --> 02:12:16.601
<v Speaker 4>times a day or whatever the dosing </v>
<v Speaker 4>regimen is and maybe it puts their all </v>

2747
02:12:16.601 --> 02:12:16.940
<v Speaker 4>sort of colitis and remission.</v>

2748
02:12:16.940 --> 02:12:21.940
<v Speaker 4>Maybe their depression is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then maybe if we get them moving in </v>

2749
02:12:21.940 --> 02:12:22.850
<v Speaker 4>a good direction and they don't feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>like shit,</v>

2750
02:12:23.270 --> 02:12:24.350
<v Speaker 4>then maybe we can say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2751
02:12:24.351 --> 02:12:26.330
<v Speaker 4>let's now get some diet changes in </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

2752
02:12:26.331 --> 02:12:28.350
<v Speaker 4>Let's get you going to bed earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you are gonna,</v>

2753
02:12:28.370 --> 02:12:33.370
<v Speaker 4>stay up and work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Put on some blue blockers so it doesn't </v>

2754
02:12:33.370 --> 02:12:34.880
<v Speaker 4>mess with your sleep patterns as much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a really accessible,</v>

2755
02:12:34.940 --> 02:12:39.940
<v Speaker 4>inexpensive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a no risk proposition that could have </v>

2756
02:12:39.940 --> 02:12:41.480
<v Speaker 4>some really huge benefits for people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2757
02:12:41.481 --> 02:12:46.481
<v Speaker 4>I think that what you said too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that this system is sort of set up to </v>

2758
02:12:46.481 --> 02:12:50.021
<v Speaker 4>get people to eat these crappy foods and</v>
<v Speaker 4>make them incredibly available and very </v>

2759
02:12:50.021 --> 02:12:53.180
<v Speaker 4>difficult to pass up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And once you start eating them,</v>

2760
02:12:53.181 --> 02:12:55.850
<v Speaker 4>you consume on a daily basis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your body starts craving them.</v>

2761
02:12:55.851 --> 02:13:00.851
<v Speaker 4>You get addicted to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was at the supermarket the other day </v>

2762
02:13:00.851 --> 02:13:02.720
<v Speaker 4>and I was under the influence and I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>always wandering through the aisles.</v>

2763
02:13:02.720 --> 02:13:05.270
<v Speaker 4>It was one of those weird moments where </v>
<v Speaker 4>I went,</v>

2764
02:13:05.271 --> 02:13:10.271
<v Speaker 4>is this always been like this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just looking at these cans of </v>

2765
02:13:10.271 --> 02:13:10.680
<v Speaker 4>food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything's can write.</v>

2766
02:13:10.690 --> 02:13:15.690
<v Speaker 4>And I was thinking this is all food,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it can last forever and like is not </v>

2767
02:13:15.690 --> 02:13:17.960
<v Speaker 4>supposed to last forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The whole idea is supposed to grow it.</v>

2768
02:13:17.990 --> 02:13:19.550
<v Speaker 4>You take it out of the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's alive,</v>

2769
02:13:19.551 --> 02:13:23.090
<v Speaker 4>you eat it and then you're healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I was looking at this food that</v>

2770
02:13:23.091 --> 02:13:28.091
<v Speaker 4>was like just filled with preservatives </v>
<v Speaker 4>and canned and these packages and </v>

2771
02:13:28.311 --> 02:13:29.810
<v Speaker 4>plastic bags of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

2772
02:13:30.230 --> 02:13:32.370
<v Speaker 4>this is so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so strange</v>

2773
02:13:32.370 --> 02:13:35.490
<v Speaker 2>that this is the prevalent food because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so easy to store.</v>

2774
02:13:35.491 --> 02:13:38.130
<v Speaker 2>It's so easy to ship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so easy to have for sale.</v>

2775
02:13:38.131 --> 02:13:40.320
<v Speaker 2>You put a barcode on the package and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're good to go.</v>

2776
02:13:40.710 --> 02:13:44.670
<v Speaker 2>But this is not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can eat it,</v>

2777
02:13:44.730 --> 02:13:46.320
<v Speaker 2>it's food kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2778
02:13:46.321 --> 02:13:49.770
<v Speaker 2>But it's not really food food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real food is on the edges.</v>

2779
02:13:50.150 --> 02:13:55.150
<v Speaker 2>The real food is where the vegetables </v>
<v Speaker 2>are and where the meats are and where </v>

2780
02:13:55.150 --> 02:13:55.590
<v Speaker 2>the eggs are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That stuff in the middle.</v>

2781
02:13:55.591 --> 02:13:58.770
<v Speaker 2>And those aisles where he just sees </v>
<v Speaker 2>bright colored cans,</v>

2782
02:13:59.050 --> 02:14:00.270
<v Speaker 2>they would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so weird.</v>

2783
02:14:00.271 --> 02:14:02.700
<v Speaker 2>It was like a little kid's toy store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2784
02:14:02.750 --> 02:14:03.570
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was high.</v>

2785
02:14:03.571 --> 02:14:08.571
<v Speaker 2>So I was wandering through the aisle and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at all these different </v>

2786
02:14:08.571 --> 02:14:08.571
<v Speaker 2>colors on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is so weird.</v>

2787
02:14:08.571 --> 02:14:13.191
<v Speaker 2>It's like trying to draw me in with </v>
<v Speaker 2>smiley faces on the cans and on the </v>

2788
02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:15.670
<v Speaker 2>plastic bags.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>

2789
02:14:16.100 --> 02:14:21.100
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you're going to a really good </v>

2790
02:14:21.100 --> 02:14:24.231
<v Speaker 2>natural food store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're probably inundated with that </v>

2791
02:14:24.231 --> 02:14:28.251
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go to the regular vons and just </v>

2792
02:14:28.251 --> 02:14:28.251
<v Speaker 2>walked down the aisle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2793
02:14:28.251 --> 02:14:30.060
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get hit with so much of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this shit.</v>

2794
02:14:30.180 --> 02:14:30.840
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

2795
02:14:30.841 --> 02:14:35.841
<v Speaker 1>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting because the folks that </v>

2796
02:14:35.841 --> 02:14:38.580
<v Speaker 1>make these foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they study neurophysiology,</v>

2797
02:14:38.581 --> 02:14:42.330
<v Speaker 1>they study evolutionary biology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they study how to make things addictive.</v>

2798
02:14:42.331 --> 02:14:43.950
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of funny.</v>

2799
02:14:43.951 --> 02:14:45.810
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand were like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gatekeepers,</v>

2800
02:14:45.811 --> 02:14:48.720
<v Speaker 1>the medical establishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the media,</v>

2801
02:14:48.721 --> 02:14:52.120
<v Speaker 1>if you talk about like this ancestral </v>
<v Speaker 1>health template or what have you there,</v>

2802
02:14:52.121 --> 02:14:55.050
<v Speaker 1>there's still a bunch of like pissing </v>
<v Speaker 1>match and contention around that.</v>

2803
02:14:55.500 --> 02:14:57.810
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the people who are making these </v>
<v Speaker 1>foods addictive,</v>

2804
02:14:57.811 --> 02:15:02.811
<v Speaker 1>they fully get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're using it in such a way that </v>

2805
02:15:02.811 --> 02:15:02.811
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2806
02:15:02.811 --> 02:15:04.380
<v Speaker 1>here's our predilection to eat more and </v>
<v Speaker 1>move less.</v>

2807
02:15:04.620 --> 02:15:09.620
<v Speaker 1>Here's how we're going to make that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen and we have these really </v>

2808
02:15:09.620 --> 02:15:11.070
<v Speaker 1>interesting flavor combinations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>different experiences and do,</v>

2809
02:15:11.330 --> 02:15:13.180
<v Speaker 1>do you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want to run that,</v>

2810
02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:18.280
<v Speaker 1>that video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's a really interesting example </v>

2811
02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:18.280
<v Speaker 1>of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2812
02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:18.510
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2813
02:15:18.540 --> 02:15:21.990
<v Speaker 1>you could get bored of even a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>tasty food,</v>

2814
02:15:22.380 --> 02:15:25.770
<v Speaker 1>but then you can figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bypass this whole process.</v>

2815
02:15:31.820 --> 02:15:36.800
<v Speaker 6>Strategy works for now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I resumed my epic ice cream.</v>

2816
02:15:38.550 --> 02:15:39.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

2817
02:15:39.301 --> 02:15:41.700
<v Speaker 1>what's going on there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it Andrew Zimmerman?</v>

2818
02:15:41.701 --> 02:15:42.570
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or no?</v>

2819
02:15:42.571 --> 02:15:45.420
<v Speaker 1>Adam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rick manned a man versus food he does.</v>

2820
02:15:45.421 --> 02:15:50.100
<v Speaker 1>He's eating challenges and he's in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing called the kitchen sink challenge.</v>

2821
02:15:50.460 --> 02:15:54.040
<v Speaker 1>It's an eight pound ice cream sundae and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think anybody would,</v>

2822
02:15:54.090 --> 02:15:57.300
<v Speaker 1>would say that an ice cream sundae is </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty tasty,</v>

2823
02:15:57.480 --> 02:16:02.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's hyper palatable like it would </v>

2824
02:16:02.480 --> 02:16:04.671
<v Speaker 1>make you want to eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what happens to him is he gets </v>

2825
02:16:04.671 --> 02:16:07.551
<v Speaker 1>completely bogged down in this process </v>
<v Speaker 1>and can't go on until he orders a plate </v>

2826
02:16:08.220 --> 02:16:10.800
<v Speaker 1>of extra salty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extra crunchy french fries.</v>

2827
02:16:11.160 --> 02:16:13.770
<v Speaker 1>So he's actually gagging on the ice </v>
<v Speaker 1>cream.</v>

2828
02:16:13.771 --> 02:16:16.740
<v Speaker 1>Can't go on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not going to win this thing and the</v>

2829
02:16:16.741 --> 02:16:21.210
<v Speaker 1>way that he gets out of this situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>is by eating more food.</v>

2830
02:16:21.660 --> 02:16:26.660
<v Speaker 1>He would not have finished the sunday </v>
<v Speaker 1>were it not for eating the french fries </v>

2831
02:16:27.130 --> 02:16:32.130
<v Speaker 1>and so you have this situation where in </v>
<v Speaker 1>are woven into our genetics is this </v>

2832
02:16:32.130 --> 02:16:37.081
<v Speaker 1>process called palate fatigue where even</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we have a really tasty food in front </v>

2833
02:16:37.081 --> 02:16:40.861
<v Speaker 1>of us we will get bored of it and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll want something else and if you </v>

2834
02:16:40.861 --> 02:16:45.331
<v Speaker 1>have that other thing that something </v>
<v Speaker 1>else immediately available and it's </v>

2835
02:16:45.331 --> 02:16:46.900
<v Speaker 1>different enough from the thing that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just got bored with,</v>

2836
02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:50.320
<v Speaker 1>you can eat more in total and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>so interesting.</v>

2837
02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:53.380
<v Speaker 1>Like he would have failed eating this </v>
<v Speaker 1>ice cream sundae.</v>

2838
02:16:53.410 --> 02:16:57.040
<v Speaker 1>We're just the sunday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not only did he eat the sunday,</v>

2839
02:16:57.041 --> 02:17:00.250
<v Speaker 1>he ate probably about 1500 calories of </v>
<v Speaker 1>extra salty,</v>

2840
02:17:00.251 --> 02:17:03.070
<v Speaker 1>extra crunchy french fries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did he know that?</v>

2841
02:17:03.071 --> 02:17:04.120
<v Speaker 1>Soon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Explained that to them.</v>

2842
02:17:04.150 --> 02:17:07.510
<v Speaker 1>So if you go to professional eating </v>
<v Speaker 1>websites,</v>

2843
02:17:07.511 --> 02:17:12.020
<v Speaker 1>like people who go do these things where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they like eat hot dogs and whatever.</v>

2844
02:17:12.150 --> 02:17:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive eater.</v>

2845
02:17:13.570 --> 02:17:15.520
<v Speaker 1>There are pairings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

2846
02:17:15.521 --> 02:17:17.770
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so with hot dogs you need something like</v>

2847
02:17:17.771 --> 02:17:21.550
<v Speaker 1>gummy bears because the hot dogs are </v>
<v Speaker 1>salty and media new mommy,</v>

2848
02:17:21.820 --> 02:17:24.700
<v Speaker 1>so you need something kind of sweet and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fruity and light.</v>

2849
02:17:25.150 --> 02:17:27.490
<v Speaker 1>And so there are all these pairings that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>

2850
02:17:27.491 --> 02:17:30.670
<v Speaker 1>And so with ice cream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's cold,</v>

2851
02:17:30.820 --> 02:17:32.290
<v Speaker 1>creamy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweet,</v>

2852
02:17:32.620 --> 02:17:35.440
<v Speaker 1>the perfect compliment to it is this </v>
<v Speaker 1>salty,</v>

2853
02:17:35.470 --> 02:17:37.810
<v Speaker 1>crunchy umami that you get out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2854
02:17:37.811 --> 02:17:40.150
<v Speaker 1>the french fries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>

2855
02:17:40.510 --> 02:17:42.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always found that if I'm eating,</v>

2856
02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:44.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm eating something and it's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

2857
02:17:44.291 --> 02:17:46.330
<v Speaker 1>like a steak or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

2858
02:17:46.750 --> 02:17:51.750
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm stuffed even if I don't want any </v>

2859
02:17:51.750 --> 02:17:54.551
<v Speaker 1>more of the steak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I have fries and I taste those salty </v>

2860
02:17:54.551 --> 02:17:54.551
<v Speaker 1>fries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll start eating more fries.</v>

2861
02:17:54.551 --> 02:17:55.750
<v Speaker 1>Like I know I'm full,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2862
02:17:55.760 --> 02:17:58.120
<v Speaker 1>Am I stuffing my fat face with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid fries?</v>

2863
02:17:58.150 --> 02:17:59.650
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that novelty.</v>

2864
02:17:59.740 --> 02:18:01.780
<v Speaker 1>And from an evolutionary biology </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

2865
02:18:01.781 --> 02:18:05.350
<v Speaker 1>it's great wiring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great engineering because we didn't</v>

2866
02:18:05.351 --> 02:18:07.510
<v Speaker 1>have guaranteed food all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2867
02:18:07.540 --> 02:18:10.030
<v Speaker 1>like you had to eat when you could get </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and then,</v>

2868
02:18:10.031 --> 02:18:15.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might go a long period of time </v>

2869
02:18:15.031 --> 02:18:17.101
<v Speaker 1>without having that food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now we're in a situation where you </v>

2870
02:18:17.101 --> 02:18:17.800
<v Speaker 1>have infinite variety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's 50,000</v>

2871
02:18:17.801 --> 02:18:22.120
<v Speaker 1>different food items in an average </v>
<v Speaker 1>supermarket is 10 or 11,000</v>

2872
02:18:22.121 --> 02:18:24.610
<v Speaker 1>new food type items that are released </v>
<v Speaker 1>each year.</v>

2873
02:18:24.910 --> 02:18:29.910
<v Speaker 1>They're engineered to be hyper palatable</v>
<v Speaker 1>to bypass the neuro regulation of </v>

2874
02:18:29.910 --> 02:18:33.151
<v Speaker 1>appetite and it's super easy to just go </v>
<v Speaker 1>fill up your pantry with a wide </v>

2875
02:18:33.151 --> 02:18:34.630
<v Speaker 1>assortment of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you can do what,</v>

2876
02:18:34.680 --> 02:18:37.780
<v Speaker 1>what he ended up doing here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can eat one meal,</v>

2877
02:18:38.080 --> 02:18:38.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like man,</v>

2878
02:18:38.831 --> 02:18:40.630
<v Speaker 1>a little sweet thing would be really </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

2879
02:18:40.660 --> 02:18:42.820
<v Speaker 1>So you have that sweet thing and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gosh,</v>

2880
02:18:42.821 --> 02:18:45.550
<v Speaker 1>a little salty crunchy would be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you have the salty,</v>

2881
02:18:45.551 --> 02:18:48.940
<v Speaker 1>crunchy and you can just keep eating </v>
<v Speaker 1>through this whole process.</v>

2882
02:18:48.941 --> 02:18:53.941
<v Speaker 1>And it really makes most of the standard</v>
<v Speaker 1>like dietetics recommendation of,</v>

2883
02:18:54.281 --> 02:18:55.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat less,</v>

2884
02:18:55.241 --> 02:18:57.010
<v Speaker 1>move more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything in moderation.</v>

2885
02:18:57.520 --> 02:18:59.740
<v Speaker 1>There's no moderation in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

2886
02:19:00.210 --> 02:19:03.670
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a hookers and cocaine experience,</v>

2887
02:19:03.671 --> 02:19:04.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2888
02:19:04.190 --> 02:19:07.510
<v Speaker 1>it's like these things spin the dopamine</v>
<v Speaker 1>centers in the brain,</v>

2889
02:19:07.540 --> 02:19:09.970
<v Speaker 1>they are addictive and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2890
02:19:09.971 --> 02:19:14.971
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if we are surprised by that process </v>

2891
02:19:14.971 --> 02:19:17.140
<v Speaker 1>at all or feel bad about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of crazy.</v>

2892
02:19:17.140 --> 02:19:22.140
<v Speaker 1>Like it is not your fault if you find </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself in trapped in this world of </v>

2893
02:19:22.481 --> 02:19:27.481
<v Speaker 1>hyper palatable foods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't suggest that people just </v>

2894
02:19:27.481 --> 02:19:29.270
<v Speaker 1>roll over and expose her belly to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and let you know,</v>

2895
02:19:29.271 --> 02:19:31.760
<v Speaker 1>let the world have its way with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But understand what,</v>

2896
02:19:31.790 --> 02:19:32.870
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why it's so difficult.</v>

2897
02:19:33.060 --> 02:19:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Like you should not feel guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There shouldn't be any drama.</v>

2898
02:19:35.991 --> 02:19:40.991
<v Speaker 1>There should be no morality around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if we just understand this is your </v>

2899
02:19:40.991 --> 02:19:43.850
<v Speaker 1>basic biological wiring and if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that and it's not your fault,</v>

2900
02:19:43.851 --> 02:19:48.851
<v Speaker 1>but let's do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we can at least decouple ourselves </v>

2901
02:19:48.851 --> 02:19:51.110
<v Speaker 1>from the emotionality and the drama and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guilt that we've had around this.</v>

2902
02:19:51.111 --> 02:19:54.920
<v Speaker 1>And we can start making some changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so many times,</v>

2903
02:19:55.090 --> 02:19:59.660
<v Speaker 1>the reason why I've heard from people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they peel out of some sort of a new</v>

2904
02:19:59.720 --> 02:20:03.380
<v Speaker 1>way of eating or lifestyle is it they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>motoring long.</v>

2905
02:20:03.380 --> 02:20:05.060
<v Speaker 1>They seem to be doing well and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

2906
02:20:05.130 --> 02:20:10.130
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just gone and then you talk to </v>

2907
02:20:10.130 --> 02:20:10.130
<v Speaker 1>them and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2908
02:20:10.130 --> 02:20:10.130
<v Speaker 1>it's just hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2909
02:20:10.130 --> 02:20:10.130
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is hard.</v>

2910
02:20:10.130 --> 02:20:11.810
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't just that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was hard.</v>

2911
02:20:12.110 --> 02:20:14.930
<v Speaker 1>They usually start getting some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>internal dialogue where,</v>

2912
02:20:14.960 --> 02:20:15.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suck.</v>

2913
02:20:16.070 --> 02:20:18.050
<v Speaker 1>I must be weak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it.</v>

2914
02:20:18.110 --> 02:20:20.360
<v Speaker 1>It's easier for that guy than it is for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

2915
02:20:20.750 --> 02:20:22.550
<v Speaker 1>So they bail on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I,</v>

2916
02:20:22.580 --> 02:20:27.580
<v Speaker 1>when I started putting this kind of spin</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this evolutionary biology and this </v>

2917
02:20:27.580 --> 02:20:30.110
<v Speaker 1>neuro regulation of appetite into </v>
<v Speaker 1>working with people,</v>

2918
02:20:30.500 --> 02:20:35.500
<v Speaker 1>particularly people who had had </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficulties with eating over the long </v>

2919
02:20:35.500 --> 02:20:35.500
<v Speaker 1>haul and maybe like some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2920
02:20:35.500 --> 02:20:37.610
<v Speaker 1>we're relationships with food or what </v>
<v Speaker 1>have you.</v>

2921
02:20:38.270 --> 02:20:39.800
<v Speaker 1>There was like this light that went on </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2922
02:20:39.801 --> 02:20:40.430
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2923
02:20:40.431 --> 02:20:41.450
<v Speaker 1>so it's not my fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2924
02:20:41.451 --> 02:20:42.470
<v Speaker 1>no man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not your fault.</v>

2925
02:20:42.470 --> 02:20:45.890
<v Speaker 1>We still need to do something and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily going to be easy,</v>

2926
02:20:46.190 --> 02:20:51.190
<v Speaker 1>but we can do this and if you aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>beating yourself up about the fact that </v>

2927
02:20:51.190 --> 02:20:53.210
<v Speaker 1>this thing is a difficult process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we're going to be able to get a lot</v>

2928
02:20:53.211 --> 02:20:58.211
<v Speaker 1>further down the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are there any foods that when you do go </v>

2929
02:20:58.211 --> 02:20:59.480
<v Speaker 1>off the rails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say if you have a cheat day and you</v>

2930
02:20:59.481 --> 02:21:00.500
<v Speaker 1>have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my god man,</v>

2931
02:21:00.530 --> 02:21:03.830
<v Speaker 1>eat a whole pizza and a bowl of </v>
<v Speaker 1>spaghetti and some fucking ice cream.</v>

2932
02:21:04.130 --> 02:21:09.130
<v Speaker 1>Is there any foods that can counter </v>
<v Speaker 1>balance the damaging effects or the </v>

2933
02:21:09.380 --> 02:21:14.380
<v Speaker 1>addictive properties?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the worst thing you want to do </v>

2934
02:21:14.380 --> 02:21:14.380
<v Speaker 1>is have a cheat day and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2935
02:21:14.380 --> 02:21:16.750
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to be a slob right now to</v>

2936
02:21:16.890 --> 02:21:18.260
<v Speaker 1>enjoy a cheat day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

2937
02:21:18.530 --> 02:21:19.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2938
02:21:19.071 --> 02:21:20.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

2939
02:21:20.560 --> 02:21:22.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

2940
02:21:23.090 --> 02:21:23.780
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2941
02:21:24.350 --> 02:21:26.930
<v Speaker 1>so instead of calling it a cheat day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I usually just say,</v>

2942
02:21:26.990 --> 02:21:28.880
<v Speaker 1>kick your heels up to whatever you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

2943
02:21:29.300 --> 02:21:32.060
<v Speaker 1>I've seen a little problem when people </v>
<v Speaker 1>set it up and they're like,</v>

2944
02:21:32.061 --> 02:21:33.680
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saturdays are my cheat days.</v>

2945
02:21:33.681 --> 02:21:35.390
<v Speaker 1>And then you start gearing up towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>saturday,</v>

2946
02:21:35.391 --> 02:21:40.391
<v Speaker 1>it's like a heroin user who get the box </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and they flip it open and they're </v>

2947
02:21:40.391 --> 02:21:44.981
<v Speaker 1>getting all their gear setup and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>anticipatory process for most of these </v>

2948
02:21:44.981 --> 02:21:49.661
<v Speaker 1>people is better than actually having </v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing and that anticipatory process </v>

2949
02:21:49.661 --> 02:21:51.270
<v Speaker 1>is getting the dopamine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2950
02:21:51.271 --> 02:21:54.020
<v Speaker 1>go on in the brain and it just gets you </v>
<v Speaker 1>all wound up and do it.</v>

2951
02:21:54.500 --> 02:21:56.100
<v Speaker 1>So ideally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2952
02:21:56.180 --> 02:21:58.670
<v Speaker 1>let's say people eat three days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three meals a day,</v>

2953
02:21:58.671 --> 02:22:00.410
<v Speaker 1>seven days a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 21 meals,</v>

2954
02:22:00.860 --> 02:22:04.420
<v Speaker 1>let's just say 19 of those meals are </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty on point and two of them are kind</v>

2955
02:22:04.421 --> 02:22:07.610
<v Speaker 1>of kick your heels up to whatever and do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it whenever you want to do it.</v>

2956
02:22:08.210 --> 02:22:13.210
<v Speaker 1>The caveat to that is are there things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are going to flip you out and </v>

2957
02:22:13.941 --> 02:22:16.010
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to come back from it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2958
02:22:16.060 --> 02:22:20.690
<v Speaker 1>And it depends if it's really an </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual thing.</v>

2959
02:22:20.691 --> 02:22:23.080
<v Speaker 1>So it could be a heroine food out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

2960
02:22:23.570 --> 02:22:25.980
<v Speaker 1>So my heroine food is a</v>

2961
02:22:26.550 --> 02:22:29.250
<v Speaker 4>sea salt and vinegar potato chips.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh I love those.</v>

2962
02:22:29.251 --> 02:22:34.251
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like kind of healthy though is vinegar </v>

2963
02:22:34.251 --> 02:22:34.251
<v Speaker 4>is potatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Potatoes,</v>

2964
02:22:34.251 --> 02:22:35.850
<v Speaker 4>salt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's bad about them?</v>

2965
02:22:36.480 --> 02:22:41.480
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you eat like a five pound bag of </v>

2966
02:22:41.480 --> 02:22:41.480
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I can do in the blink of an eye.</v>

2967
02:22:41.480 --> 02:22:43.420
<v Speaker 4>Then how big is a five pound bag of </v>
<v Speaker 4>potato chips are pretty goddamn.</v>

2968
02:22:43.440 --> 02:22:48.330
<v Speaker 4>Lots of leaf seizures,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that would be a big site bag.</v>

2969
02:22:48.331 --> 02:22:48.950
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let let,</v>

2970
02:22:48.990 --> 02:22:53.990
<v Speaker 4>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say a 16 ounce bag of potato </v>

2971
02:22:53.990 --> 02:22:53.990
<v Speaker 4>chips,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but 16 ounce bag.</v>

2972
02:22:53.990 --> 02:22:54.930
<v Speaker 4>What kind of a slob or you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>

2973
02:22:54.931 --> 02:22:59.760
<v Speaker 4>That time slot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know it's so,</v>

2974
02:22:59.950 --> 02:23:01.470
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas my wife,</v>

2975
02:23:01.530 --> 02:23:06.530
<v Speaker 4>she'll eat a little bit of potato chips </v>
<v Speaker 4>but she's more of a sweets person </v>

2976
02:23:06.530 --> 02:23:07.440
<v Speaker 4>whereas I'll have a little bit of dark </v>
<v Speaker 4>chocolate,</v>

2977
02:23:07.441 --> 02:23:12.441
<v Speaker 4>but literally a good brick of dark </v>
<v Speaker 4>chocolate will sit in the cabinet for a </v>

2978
02:23:12.441 --> 02:23:13.350
<v Speaker 4>month and I'll chip away at it.</v>

2979
02:23:13.350 --> 02:23:14.520
<v Speaker 4>A block here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a block there.</v>

2980
02:23:14.521 --> 02:23:16.200
<v Speaker 4>But if we have potato chips in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>house,</v>

2981
02:23:16.201 --> 02:23:21.201
<v Speaker 4>I will eat all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a dark chocolate and peanut butter </v>

2982
02:23:21.201 --> 02:23:21.201
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2983
02:23:21.201 --> 02:23:25.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dipped in dark chocolate and peanut </v>

2984
02:23:25.160 --> 02:23:25.160
<v Speaker 4>butter because you know you got your </v>
<v Speaker 4>chocolate in my peanut butter.</v>

2985
02:23:25.160 --> 02:23:26.520
<v Speaker 4>Remember those commercials and it tastes</v>
<v Speaker 4>delicious.</v>

2986
02:23:26.940 --> 02:23:31.940
<v Speaker 4>Guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Reese's peanut butter cups can't fuck </v>

2987
02:23:31.940 --> 02:23:32.540
<v Speaker 4>with an actual candy bar and an actual </v>
<v Speaker 4>peanut butter.</v>

2988
02:23:32.660 --> 02:23:34.050
<v Speaker 4>That's way better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2989
02:23:34.240 --> 02:23:35.200
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucked up with that.</v>

2990
02:23:35.201 --> 02:23:37.080
<v Speaker 4>It's still a really good idea though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They shouldn't have.</v>

2991
02:23:37.290 --> 02:23:42.290
<v Speaker 4>They shouldn't have done it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's why they stopped doing that </v>

2992
02:23:42.290 --> 02:23:42.290
<v Speaker 4>commercial because people said </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible],</v>

2993
02:23:42.290 --> 02:23:46.480
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going buy a chocolate bar and a</v>
<v Speaker 4>big ass tub of peanut butter and have a </v>

2994
02:23:46.480 --> 02:23:46.700
<v Speaker 4>party.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2995
02:23:46.860 --> 02:23:48.450
<v Speaker 4>It's way better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's way better.</v>

2996
02:23:48.540 --> 02:23:49.470
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in that,</v>

2997
02:23:49.471 --> 02:23:52.950
<v Speaker 4>that's an interesting to like thinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the palatability thing,</v>

2998
02:23:54.090 --> 02:23:56.490
<v Speaker 4>how much chocolate can you by itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2999
02:23:56.610 --> 02:23:58.470
<v Speaker 4>How much peanut butter can eat by </v>
<v Speaker 4>itself,</v>

3000
02:23:58.590 --> 02:24:01.020
<v Speaker 4>but together together you can fuck them </v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

3001
02:24:01.080 --> 02:24:02.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3002
02:24:02.140 --> 02:24:07.140
<v Speaker 4>In ghirardelli's chocolate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like one of those big ass thick </v>

3003
02:24:07.140 --> 02:24:07.590
<v Speaker 4>chocolate bars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh right.</v>

3004
02:24:08.150 --> 02:24:08.880
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>

3005
02:24:08.980 --> 02:24:09.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>

3006
02:24:09.841 --> 02:24:13.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm not trying to moralize it or say </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is right or that's wrong,</v>

3007
02:24:13.321 --> 02:24:16.590
<v Speaker 4>but just being aware that like stacking </v>
<v Speaker 4>those flavor combinations,</v>

3008
02:24:16.591 --> 02:24:20.670
<v Speaker 4>like in general,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you can make your meals enjoyable but</v>

3009
02:24:20.671 --> 02:24:23.790
<v Speaker 4>not over the top to the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the point that you're,</v>

3010
02:24:23.820 --> 02:24:24.990
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're overdoing it.</v>

3011
02:24:25.020 --> 02:24:27.510
<v Speaker 4>And it's just different for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3012
02:24:27.511 --> 02:24:29.430
<v Speaker 4>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sounds like you're saying enjoy it,</v>

3013
02:24:29.431 --> 02:24:31.610
<v Speaker 4>but don't enjoy it too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty much it.</v>

3014
02:24:31.870 --> 02:24:32.660
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3015
02:24:33.060 --> 02:24:34.770
<v Speaker 4>But what about someone who wants to </v>
<v Speaker 4>enjoy it?</v>

3016
02:24:34.890 --> 02:24:39.890
<v Speaker 4>What about someone who wants to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>that delicious taste of the sea salt and</v>

3017
02:24:40.471 --> 02:24:45.471
<v Speaker 4>vinegar and the potato chips.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I recommend is generally you have </v>

3018
02:24:45.471 --> 02:24:49.821
<v Speaker 4>that out of the house and you don't have</v>
<v Speaker 4>it hanging out in your pantry because </v>

3019
02:24:49.821 --> 02:24:50.080
<v Speaker 4>you go to the woods.</v>

3020
02:24:50.080 --> 02:24:53.110
<v Speaker 4>Like remember when we used to find porn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're porn the woods.</v>

3021
02:24:53.400 --> 02:24:56.370
<v Speaker 4>You to bring potato chips in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eat them in a dangerous environment.</v>

3022
02:24:56.670 --> 02:24:59.100
<v Speaker 4>So you're constantly looking over your </v>
<v Speaker 4>shoulder for wolves and shit.</v>

3023
02:24:59.180 --> 02:25:01.740
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good strategy.</v>

3024
02:25:01.741 --> 02:25:06.741
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking more just kinda like go </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the mini mart and you get it in your </v>

3025
02:25:06.741 --> 02:25:09.441
<v Speaker 4>car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yet that god made me feel like a </v>

3026
02:25:09.441 --> 02:25:11.271
<v Speaker 4>real junk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're in a bad neighborhood </v>

3027
02:25:11.271 --> 02:25:11.271
<v Speaker 4>shooting up in the parking lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

3028
02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:16.280
<v Speaker 4>So for you it's just that that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That seems like a good healthy heroin </v>

3029
02:25:16.280 --> 02:25:18.600
<v Speaker 4>food though as far as like heroin foods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's just a potato,</v>

3030
02:25:18.601 --> 02:25:23.601
<v Speaker 4>a root vegetable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I mean you can really track blood </v>

3031
02:25:23.601 --> 02:25:25.600
<v Speaker 4>sugar on it when you eat a bag of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3032
02:25:25.601 --> 02:25:27.820
<v Speaker 4>like the sea salt and vinegar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>potato chips.</v>

3033
02:25:27.821 --> 02:25:30.000
<v Speaker 4>My blood sugar was like diabetic levels.</v>

3034
02:25:30.050 --> 02:25:32.490
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's have weird dance.</v>

3035
02:25:32.550 --> 02:25:33.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would like to check it.</v>

3036
02:25:33.880 --> 02:25:38.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's squared away with a cgm if you </v>

3037
02:25:38.880 --> 02:25:39.460
<v Speaker 4>want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's continuous blood glucose monitor.</v>

3038
02:25:39.940 --> 02:25:43.030
<v Speaker 4>You put it on and it has it doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing it through your skin.</v>

3039
02:25:43.130 --> 02:25:48.130
<v Speaker 4>It's a little tiny hair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hair size probe that goes through the </v>

3040
02:25:48.130 --> 02:25:51.580
<v Speaker 4>skin and then it samples the blood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the interstitial fluid once a minute for</v>

3041
02:25:51.581 --> 02:25:54.700
<v Speaker 4>the duration that you have this thing on</v>
<v Speaker 4>usually where two or three weeks.</v>

3042
02:25:54.701 --> 02:25:55.580
<v Speaker 4>And.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

3043
02:25:55.690 --> 02:26:00.690
<v Speaker 4>yeah I was using one of those ketone </v>
<v Speaker 4>monitors where you have to cut yourself </v>

3044
02:26:00.690 --> 02:26:04.231
<v Speaker 4>and then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it doesn't make me bleed because I </v>

3045
02:26:04.231 --> 02:26:04.231
<v Speaker 4>have too many cows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His hands.</v>

3046
02:26:04.231 --> 02:26:08.430
<v Speaker 4>So it stick it in the fingers and my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my fingertip skin is too thick so I'd </v>

3047
02:26:08.430 --> 02:26:13.261
<v Speaker 4>have to go to the side of my hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking gross to like jab myself </v>

3048
02:26:13.331 --> 02:26:14.710
<v Speaker 4>and the side and my fingers.</v>

3049
02:26:14.730 --> 02:26:16.150
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've got annoyed by it.</v>

3050
02:26:16.180 --> 02:26:18.970
<v Speaker 4>This is pretty mellow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was even able to roll with it.</v>

3051
02:26:18.971 --> 02:26:21.340
<v Speaker 4>I just took some rock tape and put over </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

3052
02:26:22.850 --> 02:26:24.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

3053
02:26:24.030 --> 02:26:29.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a 50 fifty cent piece kind of deal </v>

3054
02:26:29.030 --> 02:26:30.130
<v Speaker 4>with low profile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>flat rolled with it on your body.</v>

3055
02:26:30.131 --> 02:26:33.190
<v Speaker 4>What if someone put you in like a bicep </v>
<v Speaker 4>crusher on that arm?</v>

3056
02:26:33.280 --> 02:26:34.990
<v Speaker 4>That would have sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would have sucked.</v>

3057
02:26:34.991 --> 02:26:39.991
<v Speaker 4>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what we're doing tap out before it </v>

3058
02:26:39.991 --> 02:26:41.140
<v Speaker 4>gets to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That one did not come up during.</v>

3059
02:26:41.440 --> 02:26:43.780
<v Speaker 4>Where do you put it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Usually right there.</v>

3060
02:26:43.810 --> 02:26:46.540
<v Speaker 4>It's right where I'd get you look for </v>
<v Speaker 4>that spot.</v>

3061
02:26:47.170 --> 02:26:50.380
<v Speaker 4>I know he's got that thing on and real </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking attack that thing.</v>

3062
02:26:50.830 --> 02:26:52.660
<v Speaker 4>That's so funny for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3063
02:26:52.661 --> 02:26:55.960
<v Speaker 4>It's linguine with clams.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's my heroine food.</v>

3064
02:26:56.560 --> 02:27:01.560
<v Speaker 4>I love linguine with clams.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is there any benefit to having gluten </v>

3065
02:27:01.560 --> 02:27:03.490
<v Speaker 4>free linguine versus regular linguine?</v>

3066
02:27:03.730 --> 02:27:05.980
<v Speaker 4>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're reactive to gluten then yeah,</v>

3067
02:27:06.010 --> 02:27:09.910
<v Speaker 4>it seems to me just seems like my body </v>
<v Speaker 4>processes it a little easier.</v>

3068
02:27:09.930 --> 02:27:14.930
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it doesn't seem as satisfying </v>

3069
02:27:14.930 --> 02:27:14.930
<v Speaker 4>either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hm.</v>

3070
02:27:14.930 --> 02:27:19.210
<v Speaker 4>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's been prepped pretty much the </v>

3071
02:27:19.210 --> 02:27:19.210
<v Speaker 4>same way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like,</v>

3072
02:27:19.210 --> 02:27:21.740
<v Speaker 4>it's a little less substantial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's like,</v>

3073
02:27:21.900 --> 02:27:26.900
<v Speaker 4>there's something about like real in </v>
<v Speaker 4>gleaning from a good italian restaurant </v>

3074
02:27:26.900 --> 02:27:28.480
<v Speaker 4>where has that aldente bite to it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3075
02:27:28.650 --> 02:27:31.750
<v Speaker 4>Hard to get that with gluten free pasta.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a,</v>

3076
02:27:31.751 --> 02:27:35.800
<v Speaker 4>there's a textural element to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's clearly a flavor element to it.</v>

3077
02:27:35.840 --> 02:27:39.450
<v Speaker 4>I'm gluten is just really interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the type of protein that it is,</v>

3078
02:27:39.451 --> 02:27:44.451
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is why it makes pasta and pastries </v>

3079
02:27:44.451 --> 02:27:47.641
<v Speaker 4>and everything so unique.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we don't make pastries out of corn </v>

3080
02:27:47.641 --> 02:27:50.010
<v Speaker 4>because it sucks as a medium like that </v>
<v Speaker 4>for tortillas.</v>

3081
02:27:50.011 --> 02:27:55.011
<v Speaker 4>So bad for tortillas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but You're not going to make like a </v>

3082
02:27:55.011 --> 02:27:55.011
<v Speaker 4>sandwich out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3083
02:27:55.011 --> 02:27:58.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I mean you've got those flavor </v>

3084
02:27:58.920 --> 02:28:01.231
<v Speaker 4>elements and then for some people they </v>
<v Speaker 4>do get a little bit of an opiate </v>

3085
02:28:01.231 --> 02:28:02.080
<v Speaker 4>response off of wheat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for you,</v>

3086
02:28:02.081 --> 02:28:04.750
<v Speaker 4>you have a tremendous intolerance to </v>
<v Speaker 4>wheat,</v>

3087
02:28:04.751 --> 02:28:09.751
<v Speaker 4>so you cannot fuck with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But for the average person that doesn't </v>

3088
02:28:09.751 --> 02:28:13.201
<v Speaker 4>have this tremendous intolerance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there a benefit to eating sprouted </v>

3089
02:28:13.201 --> 02:28:15.580
<v Speaker 4>bread over regular bread?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say generally,</v>

3090
02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:17.160
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Based.</v>

3091
02:28:17.710 --> 02:28:22.710
<v Speaker 4>Not necessarily nutrient,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but potentially this inflammatory </v>

3092
02:28:22.710 --> 02:28:22.710
<v Speaker 4>process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3093
02:28:22.710 --> 02:28:22.710
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3094
02:28:22.710 --> 02:28:23.570
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the enzymes,</v>

3095
02:28:23.840 --> 02:28:25.990
<v Speaker 1>the enzymes break down the gliadins and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so in,</v>

3096
02:28:26.030 --> 02:28:31.030
<v Speaker 1>in part it's just partially digested so </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easier to digest and absorb to the </v>

3097
02:28:32.841 --> 02:28:35.270
<v Speaker 1>degree that there some problems with </v>
<v Speaker 1>like glee,</v>

3098
02:28:35.280 --> 02:28:37.820
<v Speaker 1>addon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wheat germ agglutinin those proteins get</v>

3099
02:28:37.821 --> 02:28:42.821
<v Speaker 1>broken down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say that there's a lower </v>

3100
02:28:42.821 --> 02:28:42.950
<v Speaker 1>likelihood of those foods being </v>
<v Speaker 1>proinflammatory.</v>

3101
02:28:43.250 --> 02:28:44.120
<v Speaker 1>So if somebody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

3102
02:28:44.121 --> 02:28:46.770
<v Speaker 1>I want a sandwich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then doing the zika or bread and,</v>

3103
02:28:46.880 --> 02:28:51.880
<v Speaker 1>and doing it on that to me would be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty good wing compared to doing like </v>

3104
02:28:51.880 --> 02:28:53.690
<v Speaker 1>wonder bread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now is there any nutritional properties?</v>

3105
02:28:53.691 --> 02:28:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Are benefits to eating that bread?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

3106
02:28:55.390 --> 02:28:58.550
<v Speaker 1>is there anything like you could say </v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm eating something good.</v>

3107
02:28:59.060 --> 02:29:04.060
<v Speaker 1>The fact that it's a whole grain and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't been super denuded and process,</v>

3108
02:29:04.281 --> 02:29:06.510
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna have more b vitamins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could have more mineral.</v>

3109
02:29:06.511 --> 02:29:09.570
<v Speaker 1>So in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if we were to weigh out equally,</v>

3110
02:29:09.610 --> 02:29:14.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say 100 grams of this hundred grams of </v>

3111
02:29:14.610 --> 02:29:14.610
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3112
02:29:14.610 --> 02:29:14.630
<v Speaker 1>There's gonna be more vitamins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>minerals,</v>

3113
02:29:14.631 --> 02:29:17.360
<v Speaker 1>antioxidants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the zucchini bread than in the white</v>

3114
02:29:17.361 --> 02:29:22.361
<v Speaker 1>bread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though the white bread gets </v>

3115
02:29:22.361 --> 02:29:23.591
<v Speaker 1>enriched with iron and some b vitamins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that the bread is still </v>

3116
02:29:23.591 --> 02:29:25.220
<v Speaker 1>probably a win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never bought that enriched shit.</v>

3117
02:29:25.280 --> 02:29:26.800
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rich flower.</v>

3118
02:29:26.810 --> 02:29:28.700
<v Speaker 1>Like why enriching it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

3119
02:29:28.730 --> 02:29:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Because it's because without that then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get super,</v>

3120
02:29:32.091 --> 02:29:33.130
<v Speaker 1>super sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3121
02:29:33.440 --> 02:29:34.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

3122
02:29:34.791 --> 02:29:36.200
<v Speaker 1>Is that why they enrich it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3123
02:29:36.201 --> 02:29:38.860
<v Speaker 1>Because there were a nutrient deficiency</v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases like,</v>

3124
02:29:38.900 --> 02:29:40.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19 twenties,</v>

3125
02:29:40.101 --> 02:29:43.940
<v Speaker 1>19 thirties as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we really started industrializing the</v>

3126
02:29:43.941 --> 02:29:46.400
<v Speaker 1>food system and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's,</v>

3127
02:29:46.450 --> 02:29:51.450
<v Speaker 1>there's a good argument for changing </v>
<v Speaker 1>wheat flour to white flour when you </v>

3128
02:29:51.450 --> 02:29:55.670
<v Speaker 1>remove that protein and fatty element </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's in the whole wheat flour,</v>

3129
02:29:55.700 --> 02:30:00.700
<v Speaker 1>it goes rancid much faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So white flour is much more shelf </v>

3130
02:30:00.700 --> 02:30:05.561
<v Speaker 1>stable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It lasts a lot and also it has a </v>

3131
02:30:05.561 --> 02:30:05.561
<v Speaker 1>different flavor profile and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's a little more mild.</v>

3132
02:30:05.561 --> 02:30:07.340
<v Speaker 1>But there's a good argument again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

3133
02:30:07.341 --> 02:30:09.620
<v Speaker 1>it's like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that shelf stability thing,</v>

3134
02:30:09.650 --> 02:30:14.650
<v Speaker 1>this is part of the hallmark of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's maybe not a great </v>

3135
02:30:14.650 --> 02:30:18.101
<v Speaker 1>option other than chicharrones teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rene's could last a million years and </v>

3136
02:30:18.101 --> 02:30:18.101
<v Speaker 1>they're still amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

3137
02:30:18.390 --> 02:30:20.770
<v Speaker 1>there is an exception to everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

3138
02:30:21.320 --> 02:30:26.320
<v Speaker 1>there was economic and pallet incentives</v>
<v Speaker 1>for why you would want to make this </v>

3139
02:30:28.130 --> 02:30:30.080
<v Speaker 1>white flour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it also,</v>

3140
02:30:30.081 --> 02:30:35.081
<v Speaker 1>people started getting more nutrient </v>
<v Speaker 1>deficiencies because the amount of b </v>

3141
02:30:35.081 --> 02:30:36.770
<v Speaker 1>vitamins and whatnot that usually come </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that whole grain where were gone.</v>

3142
02:30:36.830 --> 02:30:41.830
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The zucchini bread is notoriously poor </v>

3143
02:30:41.830 --> 02:30:42.450
<v Speaker 1>as far as like shelf life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3144
02:30:43.120 --> 02:30:45.680
<v Speaker 1>It gets moldy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like almost immediately.</v>

3145
02:30:45.681 --> 02:30:46.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3146
02:30:46.110 --> 02:30:51.110
<v Speaker 1>Really building fridge and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the few breads that I </v>

3147
02:30:51.110 --> 02:30:51.470
<v Speaker 1>always keep in the fridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

3148
02:30:51.471 --> 02:30:53.660
<v Speaker 1>So it's not necessarily good for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

3149
02:30:53.661 --> 02:30:57.140
<v Speaker 1>It's better for you then say a process </v>
<v Speaker 1>wheat bread,</v>

3150
02:30:57.141 --> 02:31:01.980
<v Speaker 1>but it's not really good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take those.</v>

3151
02:31:02.510 --> 02:31:03.830
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3152
02:31:03.831 --> 02:31:08.831
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a really good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never really thought about it like </v>

3153
02:31:08.831 --> 02:31:08.831
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3154
02:31:08.831 --> 02:31:10.710
<v Speaker 1>like is a blueberry good for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You as a piece of steak?</v>

3155
02:31:10.880 --> 02:31:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3156
02:31:11.860 --> 02:31:15.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you again.</v>

3157
02:31:15.330 --> 02:31:20.120
<v Speaker 1>So if we did a nutrient density kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>story and we looked that as equal brag</v>

3158
02:31:20.130 --> 02:31:24.800
<v Speaker 4>compared to good types of fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vegetables,</v>

3159
02:31:24.810 --> 02:31:29.810
<v Speaker 4>squash,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that the equal bread would look </v>

3160
02:31:29.810 --> 02:31:32.451
<v Speaker 4>pretty skinny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you had 100 calories of this </v>

3161
02:31:32.451 --> 02:31:33.090
<v Speaker 4>versus 100 calories of these.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>

3162
02:31:33.091 --> 02:31:35.790
<v Speaker 4>we looked at the vitamins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>minerals,</v>

3163
02:31:35.791 --> 02:31:40.791
<v Speaker 4>antioxidants that both of them had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think the is eql bread would be </v>

3164
02:31:40.791 --> 02:31:44.511
<v Speaker 4>a real rock star,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I bet it would be better than white </v>

3165
02:31:44.511 --> 02:31:47.661
<v Speaker 4>rice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would probably be as good or on par </v>

3166
02:31:47.661 --> 02:31:48.630
<v Speaker 4>with something like lentils or something</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

3167
02:31:48.631 --> 02:31:49.650
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as far as vitamins,</v>

3168
02:31:49.651 --> 02:31:50.790
<v Speaker 4>minerals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>antioxidants,</v>

3169
02:31:50.791 --> 02:31:55.791
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's weird to me because I would </v>

3170
02:31:55.791 --> 02:31:55.791
<v Speaker 4>think that lentils would be vitamin </v>
<v Speaker 4>rich.</v>

3171
02:31:55.980 --> 02:31:58.530
<v Speaker 4>Not huge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're not terrible either.</v>

3172
02:31:58.531 --> 02:32:01.410
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's just all this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>relative thing.</v>

3173
02:32:01.411 --> 02:32:04.590
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rhonda patrick is really good about this</v>

3174
02:32:04.591 --> 02:32:09.591
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's really geeked out on what are the </v>

3175
02:32:09.591 --> 02:32:11.391
<v Speaker 4>most nutrient dense foods out there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to really make an emphasis of of </v>

3176
02:32:11.391 --> 02:32:11.640
<v Speaker 4>eating those.</v>

3177
02:32:12.180 --> 02:32:14.820
<v Speaker 4>And so like sprouts tend to be at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>topic list.</v>

3178
02:32:14.821 --> 02:32:19.821
<v Speaker 4>And then interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things like organ meats are super high </v>

3179
02:32:19.821 --> 02:32:19.821
<v Speaker 4>up on the list and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3180
02:32:19.821 --> 02:32:24.230
<v Speaker 4>and it starts kind of stratifying our </v>
<v Speaker 4>herbs and spices tend to be off the </v>

3181
02:32:24.230 --> 02:32:28.170
<v Speaker 4>richter high in nutrient density,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we tend to not eat a ton of them,</v>

3182
02:32:28.171 --> 02:32:30.540
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like ginger and basil and garlic and all</v>

3183
02:32:30.541 --> 02:32:34.180
<v Speaker 4>those things are really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really nutrient dense and they also seem</v>

3184
02:32:34.181 --> 02:32:36.820
<v Speaker 4>to have medicinal qualities and </v>
<v Speaker 4>antimicrobial quality.</v>

3185
02:32:36.821 --> 02:32:39.870
<v Speaker 4>So there's some interesting stuff there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

3186
02:32:39.871 --> 02:32:41.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the end of the day,</v>

3187
02:32:41.270 --> 02:32:43.130
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3188
02:32:43.140 --> 02:32:44.790
<v Speaker 4>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people do try to do it.</v>

3189
02:32:44.791 --> 02:32:47.940
<v Speaker 4>It's like every meal is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>blueberries and the,</v>

3190
02:32:47.970 --> 02:32:52.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wild caught deep water fish and you </v>

3191
02:32:52.970 --> 02:32:54.810
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a mountain of greens in and god love you</v>

3192
02:32:54.840 --> 02:32:56.190
<v Speaker 4>for doing that I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

3193
02:32:56.220 --> 02:33:00.480
<v Speaker 4>every meal does not have to be that way </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be pretty damn healthy.</v>

3194
02:33:00.480 --> 02:33:01.830
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know all that.</v>

3195
02:33:01.831 --> 02:33:06.831
<v Speaker 4>So that's where the is equal bread.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's probably not like a </v>

3196
02:33:06.831 --> 02:33:09.830
<v Speaker 4>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>By no means is it a terrible option in </v>

3197
02:33:09.830 --> 02:33:09.830
<v Speaker 4>the story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's not a terrible option,</v>

3198
02:33:09.830 --> 02:33:12.180
<v Speaker 4>but it's not necessarily the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>nutrient dense than you can eat.</v>

3199
02:33:12.220 --> 02:33:12.950
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

3200
02:33:14.580 --> 02:33:15.390
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

3201
02:33:15.510 --> 02:33:16.020
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3202
02:33:16.160 --> 02:33:21.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now getting back to what I asked </v>

3203
02:33:21.160 --> 02:33:21.160
<v Speaker 4>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there a food that you would recommend</v>

3204
02:33:21.160 --> 02:33:24.300
<v Speaker 4>for a guy who did eat that one pound bag</v>
<v Speaker 4>of potato chips?</v>

3205
02:33:24.301 --> 02:33:27.360
<v Speaker 4>Is there anything or is it fasting maybe</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best?</v>

3206
02:33:27.440 --> 02:33:29.010
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the best option.</v>

3207
02:33:29.011 --> 02:33:34.011
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean something like that or just you </v>

3208
02:33:34.011 --> 02:33:34.011
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some period of,</v>

3209
02:33:34.011 --> 02:33:35.580
<v Speaker 4>of less intake and so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3210
02:33:35.581 --> 02:33:38.610
<v Speaker 4>but then that gets like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hear people screaming like,</v>

3211
02:33:38.790 --> 02:33:40.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>disordered eating now,</v>

3212
02:33:40.561 --> 02:33:40.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3213
02:33:40.981 --> 02:33:41.730
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's food,</v>

3214
02:33:41.760 --> 02:33:42.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

3215
02:33:42.570 --> 02:33:44.340
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a eating disorder.</v>

3216
02:33:45.200 --> 02:33:47.280
<v Speaker 4>How does fasting considered an eating </v>
<v Speaker 4>disorder?</v>

3217
02:33:47.730 --> 02:33:52.730
<v Speaker 4>It's not eating and eating disorders </v>
<v Speaker 4>seems to me to be like maybe so many </v>

3218
02:33:52.861 --> 02:33:57.861
<v Speaker 4>bulemia start associating with low like </v>
<v Speaker 4>anorexia it and potentially the bulemia </v>

3219
02:33:58.231 --> 02:34:00.630
<v Speaker 4>dna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sick people don't fast.</v>

3220
02:34:01.140 --> 02:34:04.000
<v Speaker 4>That's what's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just don't eat right.</v>

3221
02:34:04.350 --> 02:34:07.710
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well it's interesting again,</v>

3222
02:34:07.711 --> 02:34:09.570
<v Speaker 4>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the only thing.</v>

3223
02:34:09.960 --> 02:34:14.960
<v Speaker 4>So you could eat like a cockroach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you could walk into a work </v>

3224
02:34:14.960 --> 02:34:16.410
<v Speaker 4>environment or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like post your photos on instagram.</v>

3225
02:34:16.411 --> 02:34:18.060
<v Speaker 4>About eating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having a big,</v>

3226
02:34:18.220 --> 02:34:20.650
<v Speaker 4>big gulp and donuts and all this other </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucked up stuff.</v>

3227
02:34:20.651 --> 02:34:23.380
<v Speaker 4>And most dietitians won't really bat an </v>
<v Speaker 4>eye at that.</v>

3228
02:34:23.381 --> 02:34:23.860
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3229
02:34:23.861 --> 02:34:26.500
<v Speaker 4>you should eat better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're not gonna say anything.</v>

3230
02:34:26.980 --> 02:34:31.980
<v Speaker 4>But if you post some stuff about a low </v>
<v Speaker 4>carb paleo kind of look and deal than </v>

3231
02:34:31.980 --> 02:34:33.310
<v Speaker 4>you're a disorder dieter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or if you eat gluten free,</v>

3232
02:34:33.311 --> 02:34:34.690
<v Speaker 4>then they call it disordered eating.</v>

3233
02:34:34.750 --> 02:34:37.150
<v Speaker 4>Intermittent fasting is being called </v>
<v Speaker 4>disordered eating.</v>

3234
02:34:37.310 --> 02:34:42.310
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but who is it being called it by </v>

3235
02:34:42.310 --> 02:34:42.400
<v Speaker 4>generally like the dietetics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>healthcare,</v>

3236
02:34:42.450 --> 02:34:43.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of mainstream.</v>

3237
02:34:43.601 --> 02:34:46.150
<v Speaker 4>Like I get a sale by these people all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time.</v>

3238
02:34:46.270 --> 02:34:50.860
<v Speaker 4>And the intermittent fasting thing is </v>
<v Speaker 4>really fascinating because again,</v>

3239
02:34:50.861 --> 02:34:54.340
<v Speaker 4>for just a very brief historical step </v>
<v Speaker 4>back,</v>

3240
02:34:54.341 --> 02:34:57.160
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have humans always had three meals a day</v>

3241
02:34:57.400 --> 02:34:59.680
<v Speaker 4>and most people don't even eat just </v>
<v Speaker 4>three meals a day.</v>

3242
02:34:59.681 --> 02:35:02.260
<v Speaker 4>They just eat all day long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3243
02:35:02.261 --> 02:35:02.860
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3244
02:35:02.861 --> 02:35:07.861
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there some clear problems with that </v>

3245
02:35:07.861 --> 02:35:09.340
<v Speaker 4>from an implementation standpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've done some studies where they had</v>

3246
02:35:09.341 --> 02:35:13.630
<v Speaker 4>people eat a caloric restricted diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which should be anti inflammatory,</v>

3247
02:35:14.050 --> 02:35:19.050
<v Speaker 4>but the one group of calorie restricted </v>
<v Speaker 4>folks eat consistently throughout the </v>

3248
02:35:19.050 --> 02:35:22.930
<v Speaker 4>day and they don't get that </v>
<v Speaker 4>antiinflammatory benefit because they're</v>

3249
02:35:22.931 --> 02:35:27.310
<v Speaker 4>just constantly keeping their digestive </v>
<v Speaker 4>system going and all that type of stuff.</v>

3250
02:35:27.311 --> 02:35:28.420
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3251
02:35:28.421 --> 02:35:33.421
<v Speaker 4>there's some really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really strong evidence and suggestion </v>

3252
02:35:33.421 --> 02:35:35.350
<v Speaker 4>that some sort of punctuated eating </v>
<v Speaker 4>pattern would be really healthy,</v>

3253
02:35:35.351 --> 02:35:36.190
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3254
02:35:36.191 --> 02:35:37.270
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3255
02:35:37.271 --> 02:35:37.740
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

3256
02:35:37.760 --> 02:35:38.770
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting.</v>

3257
02:35:38.770 --> 02:35:43.770
<v Speaker 4>On the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's being really aggressively </v>

3258
02:35:43.770 --> 02:35:45.250
<v Speaker 4>researched in the kind of cutting edge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3259
02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:47.020
<v Speaker 4>communities like rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Patrick valter,</v>

3260
02:35:47.021 --> 02:35:49.720
<v Speaker 4>longo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dom talks about this stuff a lot,</v>

3261
02:35:49.721 --> 02:35:53.830
<v Speaker 4>but then when you get into kind of thiS </v>
<v Speaker 4>mainstream dietetics story,</v>

3262
02:35:54.250 --> 02:35:59.250
<v Speaker 4>they're just freaked out by this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they really can't wrap their heads </v>

3263
02:35:59.250 --> 02:36:00.730
<v Speaker 4>saying people probably aren't even </v>
<v Speaker 4>freaked out about those lap bands.</v>

3264
02:36:01.150 --> 02:36:01.900
<v Speaker 4>Those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3265
02:36:01.940 --> 02:36:05.590
<v Speaker 4>This is disgusting bands that they put </v>
<v Speaker 4>around people's stomachs.</v>

3266
02:36:05.591 --> 02:36:06.850
<v Speaker 4>What do they call them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Black bands,</v>

3267
02:36:06.851 --> 02:36:08.450
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3268
02:36:09.250 --> 02:36:14.250
<v Speaker 4>I saw some guy arguing for a vegan diet </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I found out that he was a </v>

3269
02:36:14.250 --> 02:36:16.270
<v Speaker 4>surgeon that performed stomach shrinking</v>
<v Speaker 4>operations.</v>

3270
02:36:16.271 --> 02:36:16.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3271
02:36:16.931 --> 02:36:17.550
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3272
02:36:17.650 --> 02:36:22.650
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what the fUck band are you trying </v>

3273
02:36:22.650 --> 02:36:22.650
<v Speaker 4>to get people healthy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you just trying to make money?</v>

3274
02:36:22.650 --> 02:36:23.260
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>

3275
02:36:23.650 --> 02:36:27.160
<v Speaker 4>We'll with some Folks is the only option</v>
<v Speaker 4>bullshit.</v>

3276
02:36:27.580 --> 02:36:28.780
<v Speaker 4>It's never the only option.</v>

3277
02:36:28.780 --> 02:36:30.580
<v Speaker 4>Does your mouth work?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do your hands.</v>

3278
02:36:30.581 --> 02:36:32.560
<v Speaker 4>Where Can you put food in your mouth?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then?</v>

3279
02:36:32.561 --> 02:36:37.000
<v Speaker 4>It's not the only option to and </v>
<v Speaker 4>disempowering people or saying that it's</v>

3280
02:36:37.001 --> 02:36:38.980
<v Speaker 4>the only option for some folks to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>them healthy.</v>

3281
02:36:39.370 --> 02:36:44.370
<v Speaker 4>That is insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You are coddling them to the point of </v>

3282
02:36:44.370 --> 02:36:46.300
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're willing to diminish their,</v>

3283
02:36:46.330 --> 02:36:50.590
<v Speaker 4>their overall physical structure of </v>
<v Speaker 4>their digestive system.</v>

3284
02:36:50.790 --> 02:36:51.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what you're doing,</v>

3285
02:36:51.611 --> 02:36:56.611
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've read some horrendous things about </v>

3286
02:36:56.611 --> 02:36:57.320
<v Speaker 4>the consequences of these stomach </v>
<v Speaker 4>mineralization,</v>

3287
02:36:57.350 --> 02:37:01.720
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>activities or the surgeries rather.</v>

3288
02:37:02.150 --> 02:37:07.150
<v Speaker 4>It's really scary stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to completely limit what you </v>

3289
02:37:07.150 --> 02:37:09.931
<v Speaker 4>eat from now on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your stomach is about the size of my </v>

3290
02:37:09.931 --> 02:37:12.271
<v Speaker 4>fist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now it's this little tiny thing and you </v>

3291
02:37:12.271 --> 02:37:14.611
<v Speaker 4>get full quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's the psychological mechanism </v>

3292
02:37:14.611 --> 02:37:14.780
<v Speaker 4>behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get full quicker and,</v>

3293
02:37:14.900 --> 02:37:15.770
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3294
02:37:15.771 --> 02:37:20.771
<v Speaker 4>the rabbit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the interesting thing is almost </v>

3295
02:37:20.771 --> 02:37:21.620
<v Speaker 4>immediately when people undergo these </v>
<v Speaker 4>procedures,</v>

3296
02:37:21.680 --> 02:37:26.680
<v Speaker 4>if they were like a type two diabetic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they come out of it and they're no </v>

3297
02:37:26.680 --> 02:37:27.920
<v Speaker 4>longer a type two diabetic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost immediately,</v>

3298
02:37:27.921 --> 02:37:30.020
<v Speaker 4>like it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really interesting.</v>

3299
02:37:30.500 --> 02:37:33.630
<v Speaker 4>So there's that upside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then also the longterm,</v>

3300
02:37:33.770 --> 02:37:34.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two years,</v>

3301
02:37:34.641 --> 02:37:35.660
<v Speaker 4>three years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four years,</v>

3302
02:37:36.080 --> 02:37:39.440
<v Speaker 4>almost inevitably they get themselves </v>
<v Speaker 4>back into the situation they were in.</v>

3303
02:37:39.730 --> 02:37:43.730
<v Speaker 4>And part of what's interesting is </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they have such a small stomach,</v>

3304
02:37:44.090 --> 02:37:49.090
<v Speaker 4>they can't hardly eat anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's a tendency towards eating </v>

3305
02:37:49.090 --> 02:37:50.900
<v Speaker 4>more refined food because that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

3306
02:37:50.930 --> 02:37:51.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

3307
02:37:51.470 --> 02:37:55.070
<v Speaker 4>they just can't eat that much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's um,</v>

3308
02:37:55.490 --> 02:37:57.770
<v Speaker 4>I know a guy broke his out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>

3309
02:37:58.100 --> 02:38:00.440
<v Speaker 4>Oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got a stomach shrunk,</v>

3310
02:38:00.500 --> 02:38:05.500
<v Speaker 4>got an operation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's a big fat guy and got a stomach </v>

3311
02:38:05.500 --> 02:38:06.710
<v Speaker 4>cut and then broke it out and had to go </v>
<v Speaker 4>and get a second surgery.</v>

3312
02:38:07.310 --> 02:38:08.570
<v Speaker 4>YeaH,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

3313
02:38:09.040 --> 02:38:11.840
<v Speaker 4>that's where I'm very glad I didn't go </v>
<v Speaker 4>into medicine specifically.</v>

3314
02:38:11.841 --> 02:38:16.841
<v Speaker 4>Like that's just such a quagmire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would probably shoot myself being in </v>

3315
02:38:16.841 --> 02:38:21.131
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get infuriated when someone says that </v>

3316
02:38:21.131 --> 02:38:21.131
<v Speaker 4>that's the only option.</v>

3317
02:38:21.131 --> 02:38:22.490
<v Speaker 4>For some people that is not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is just absolutely not true.</v>

3318
02:38:22.520 --> 02:38:25.220
<v Speaker 4>There are always options if you have </v>
<v Speaker 4>willpower of you,</v>

3319
02:38:25.221 --> 02:38:26.720
<v Speaker 4>have a mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have a support system,</v>

3320
02:38:26.960 --> 02:38:29.150
<v Speaker 4>if you have people that can coach you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're willing to listen,</v>

3321
02:38:29.151 --> 02:38:34.151
<v Speaker 4>if you're willing to understand and </v>
<v Speaker 4>believe the consequences of your </v>

3322
02:38:34.151 --> 02:38:36.641
<v Speaker 4>actions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can change your diet and your </v>

3323
02:38:36.641 --> 02:38:36.641
<v Speaker 4>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can,</v>

3324
02:38:36.641 --> 02:38:39.060
<v Speaker 4>and it doesn't matter if you're 600 </v>
<v Speaker 4>pounds or 60 pounds overweight,</v>

3325
02:38:39.090 --> 02:38:41.300
<v Speaker 4>86 pounds overweight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can make changes.</v>

3326
02:38:41.380 --> 02:38:46.380
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting because insurance will </v>

3327
02:38:46.380 --> 02:38:47.600
<v Speaker 4>reimburse for these like lap band,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gastric bypass surgeries and they're 30,</v>

3328
02:38:47.601 --> 02:38:49.190
<v Speaker 4>$40,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

3329
02:38:49.210 --> 02:38:52.850
<v Speaker 4>to pump people through it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's really difficult to get them to</v>

3330
02:38:52.851 --> 02:38:55.670
<v Speaker 4>reimburse like a gym membership,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a health coach,</v>

3331
02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:57.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that type of stuff.</v>

3332
02:38:57.741 --> 02:38:58.820
<v Speaker 4>Which,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which um,</v>

3333
02:38:59.090 --> 02:39:02.450
<v Speaker 4>well it's got to be some collusion </v>
<v Speaker 4>between the healthcare providers and the</v>

3334
02:39:02.480 --> 02:39:03.290
<v Speaker 4>medical industry.</v>

3335
02:39:03.290 --> 02:39:04.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just to dylan,</v>

3336
02:39:04.330 --> 02:39:07.400
<v Speaker 4>that's the only thing that makes sense </v>
<v Speaker 4>or that people demand it so much so they</v>

3337
02:39:07.401 --> 02:39:09.370
<v Speaker 4>can't deny it from people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3338
02:39:10.320 --> 02:39:15.320
<v Speaker 4>It's just very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very frustrating for me when you tell </v>

3339
02:39:15.320 --> 02:39:17.681
<v Speaker 4>people that they don't have any other </v>
<v Speaker 4>options and that this is the best </v>

3340
02:39:17.681 --> 02:39:21.341
<v Speaker 4>options to cut you open and cut your </v>
<v Speaker 4>stomach and stitch it back to a smaller </v>

3341
02:39:22.191 --> 02:39:23.990
<v Speaker 4>version of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Didn't have what it is.</v>

3342
02:39:24.080 --> 02:39:24.670
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it end.</v>

3343
02:39:24.680 --> 02:39:29.680
<v Speaker 4>Did you see that thing wheRe they now </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a stomach pump where you can,</v>

3344
02:39:29.810 --> 02:39:32.210
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they basically put a tube in there,</v>

3345
02:39:32.211 --> 02:39:37.211
<v Speaker 4>you can eat the food and then pump the </v>
<v Speaker 4>food out of the stomach and this thing </v>

3346
02:39:37.211 --> 02:39:41.030
<v Speaker 4>is awaiting fda approval.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they stay in roman times.</v>

3347
02:39:41.031 --> 02:39:42.230
<v Speaker 4>This is where like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3348
02:39:42.231 --> 02:39:42.740
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3349
02:39:42.741 --> 02:39:43.260
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3350
02:39:43.370 --> 02:39:45.940
<v Speaker 4>bread and circus just keep everybody </v>
<v Speaker 4>entertained and that old,</v>

3351
02:39:45.950 --> 02:39:50.950
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing collapses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they used to have the vomitorium </v>

3352
02:39:50.950 --> 02:39:50.950
<v Speaker 4>where people would eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know tHat?</v>

3353
02:39:50.950 --> 02:39:52.380
<v Speaker 4>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

3354
02:39:52.381 --> 02:39:57.381
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not only is it not true vomitorium </v>

3355
02:39:57.381 --> 02:39:57.381
<v Speaker 4>doesn't mean that we.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What vomitorium means,</v>

3356
02:39:57.381 --> 02:40:00.620
<v Speaker 4>it's the entrance and exit to an arena.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The volley.</v>

3357
02:40:00.621 --> 02:40:03.020
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is something that I've gone into in</v>

3358
02:40:03.021 --> 02:40:08.021
<v Speaker 4>great detail and I went to the colosseum</v>
<v Speaker 4>in rome and they explained the </v>

3359
02:40:08.021 --> 02:40:10.100
<v Speaker 4>vomitorium and it's just a misdemeanor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're crushing.</v>

3360
02:40:10.101 --> 02:40:12.980
<v Speaker 4>My head shouldn't be saying that this is</v>
<v Speaker 4>crushing.</v>

3361
02:40:12.990 --> 02:40:14.340
<v Speaker 4>My whole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like rome</v>

3362
02:40:14.340 --> 02:40:19.340
<v Speaker 2>fell work in a fall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guys used to throw up and now </v>

3363
02:40:19.340 --> 02:40:19.470
<v Speaker 2>we're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They may have done that.</v>

3364
02:40:19.471 --> 02:40:24.471
<v Speaker 2>They may have thrown up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't that a vomitorium </v>

3365
02:40:24.471 --> 02:40:24.471
<v Speaker 2>vomitorium is here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pull it up jamie.</v>

3366
02:40:24.471 --> 02:40:27.570
<v Speaker 2>So he could see what a vomitorium is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a vomitorium is,</v>

3367
02:40:27.571 --> 02:40:32.571
<v Speaker 2>is the actual structure of an arena like</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the people come out and go through</v>

3368
02:40:32.911 --> 02:40:35.820
<v Speaker 2>this area and it has nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the word vomit.</v>

3369
02:40:36.180 --> 02:40:37.620
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How am I going to tell them?</v>

3370
02:40:37.621 --> 02:40:41.580
<v Speaker 2>My post apocalyptic story about rome got</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked heading.</v>

3371
02:40:42.720 --> 02:40:47.640
<v Speaker 2>That sort of vomitorium is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how do I tell the fucked up?</v>

3372
02:40:47.700 --> 02:40:48.830
<v Speaker 2>You should have googled it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3373
02:40:48.870 --> 02:40:49.860
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should've done a.</v>

3374
02:40:49.861 --> 02:40:50.940
<v Speaker 2>We did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fucked up.</v>

3375
02:40:50.941 --> 02:40:55.310
<v Speaker 2>You tried to pass away some some </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit man up.</v>

3376
02:40:55.311 --> 02:40:56.230
<v Speaker 2>So chagrined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

3377
02:40:56.580 --> 02:41:01.580
<v Speaker 2>But it's important because I read a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people telling me that and educated </v>

3378
02:41:01.580 --> 02:41:01.680
<v Speaker 2>people like yourself have said that it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just not true.</v>

3379
02:41:01.710 --> 02:41:06.710
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what a go back to that image of </v>

3380
02:41:06.710 --> 02:41:06.710
<v Speaker 2>assist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3381
02:41:06.710 --> 02:41:10.110
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these vomitorium exist in every arena.</v>

3382
02:41:10.170 --> 02:41:15.170
<v Speaker 2>That's what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The stairways come down and then that </v>

3383
02:41:15.170 --> 02:41:15.510
<v Speaker 2>opening at the bottom of the stairway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a vomitorium,</v>

3384
02:41:15.950 --> 02:41:17.760
<v Speaker 2>but what is the origin of the word?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now?</v>

3385
02:41:17.761 --> 02:41:19.230
<v Speaker 2>They threw up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they threw up.</v>

3386
02:41:19.231 --> 02:41:21.490
<v Speaker 2>A few of them did really rich people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to eat and keep eating.</v>

3387
02:41:21.550 --> 02:41:23.490
<v Speaker 2>They threw up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not what it is.</v>

3388
02:41:23.500 --> 02:41:27.560
<v Speaker 2>Like go larger please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I can see that his series of interest</v>

3389
02:41:27.561 --> 02:41:30.690
<v Speaker 2>is or exit pastures in ancient roman </v>
<v Speaker 2>amphitheater or theater.</v>

3390
02:41:30.720 --> 02:41:33.360
<v Speaker 2>A place where which according to popular</v>
<v Speaker 2>misconception,</v>

3391
02:41:33.720 --> 02:41:38.720
<v Speaker 2>the ancient romans were supposed to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>vomited during fees to make room for </v>

3392
02:41:38.720 --> 02:41:38.720
<v Speaker 2>more food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not true.</v>

3393
02:41:38.720 --> 02:41:39.510
<v Speaker 2>THere you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

3394
02:41:39.511 --> 02:41:40.890
<v Speaker 2>Sorry dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man.</v>

3395
02:41:41.160 --> 02:41:44.400
<v Speaker 2>It's important that you know about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I am properly chagrin thing.</v>

3396
02:41:44.410 --> 02:41:49.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just one of those things that </v>

3397
02:41:49.410 --> 02:41:49.410
<v Speaker 2>people repeat and then they never </v>
<v Speaker 2>bothered looking it up.</v>

3398
02:41:49.410 --> 02:41:51.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would that pump though?</v>

3399
02:41:51.210 --> 02:41:53.610
<v Speaker 2>Go back to that fucking disgusting </v>
<v Speaker 2>stomach pump.</v>

3400
02:41:54.150 --> 02:41:56.430
<v Speaker 2>This is so nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is a high.</v>

3401
02:41:56.431 --> 02:42:01.431
<v Speaker 2>I'm fat and my brain is stupid and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>just love to eat so I can eat now and </v>

3402
02:42:02.071 --> 02:42:04.650
<v Speaker 2>yay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eat normal healthy meals.</v>

3403
02:42:04.950 --> 02:42:08.310
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that girl in the middle is triggered,</v>

3404
02:42:08.340 --> 02:42:13.340
<v Speaker 2>I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you stick this pump through a </v>

3405
02:42:13.340 --> 02:42:14.610
<v Speaker 2>fucking hole in your belly button and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>sucks out the food because nothing could</v>

3406
02:42:14.611 --> 02:42:15.380
<v Speaker 2>go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

3407
02:42:15.420 --> 02:42:17.670
<v Speaker 2>Look at her for honey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go outside,</v>

3408
02:42:17.700 --> 02:42:19.320
<v Speaker 2>go running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop.</v>

3409
02:42:19.530 --> 02:42:24.530
<v Speaker 2>Look at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put the food in my mouth and it sends </v>

3410
02:42:24.530 --> 02:42:26.370
<v Speaker 2>a signal to my brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a simple procedure.</v>

3411
02:42:26.400 --> 02:42:28.890
<v Speaker 2>Low risk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely reversible.</v>

3412
02:42:29.670 --> 02:42:32.850
<v Speaker 2>Takes just 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about fuck you?</v>

3413
02:42:33.690 --> 02:42:37.110
<v Speaker 2>Twilight sedation back in home and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of hours.</v>

3414
02:42:37.380 --> 02:42:42.380
<v Speaker 2>Look at that cartoon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cartoon people like that girl needs </v>

3415
02:42:42.380 --> 02:42:43.110
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That girl's hot as fuck.</v>

3416
02:42:43.140 --> 02:42:45.180
<v Speaker 2>She's skinny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even cartoon hot.</v>

3417
02:42:45.600 --> 02:42:46.920
<v Speaker 2>This is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need it,</v>

3418
02:42:46.921 --> 02:42:48.060
<v Speaker 2>honey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop.</v>

3419
02:42:48.400 --> 02:42:49.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is her afterwards.</v>

3420
02:42:49.890 --> 02:42:51.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's her.</v>

3421
02:42:51.440 --> 02:42:54.220
<v Speaker 2>This is all these people that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>shrunk down from having.</v>

3422
02:42:54.240 --> 02:42:56.490
<v Speaker 2>When I go back to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go back to that.</v>

3423
02:42:57.630 --> 02:43:02.630
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all you people that have benefited from </v>

3424
02:43:02.630 --> 02:43:02.630
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could do another thing.</v>

3425
02:43:02.630 --> 02:43:06.540
<v Speaker 2>You could just change your diet and one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the most powerful benefits of the key</v>

3426
02:43:06.541 --> 02:43:11.541
<v Speaker 2>to genic died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His appetite suppression and that </v>

3427
02:43:11.541 --> 02:43:12.580
<v Speaker 2>appetite suppression is fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

3428
02:43:12.581 --> 02:43:15.310
<v Speaker 2>Even for a person like me who's never </v>
<v Speaker 2>really struggled with their weight,</v>

3429
02:43:16.180 --> 02:43:20.170
<v Speaker 2>I find that going without food is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>only is it easy,</v>

3430
02:43:20.470 --> 02:43:23.410
<v Speaker 2>but it's really inconsequential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not an issue at all.</v>

3431
02:43:23.411 --> 02:43:25.180
<v Speaker 2>I can go without for five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six hours,</v>

3432
02:43:25.181 --> 02:43:26.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't bother me at all.</v>

3433
02:43:27.160 --> 02:43:28.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>

3434
02:43:28.580 --> 02:43:30.920
<v Speaker 1>it's super liberating and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tooth,</v>

3435
02:43:31.520 --> 02:43:36.520
<v Speaker 1>it's powerful as it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can also be where people get </v>

3436
02:43:36.520 --> 02:43:39.911
<v Speaker 1>themselves in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the problems that are ascribed </v>

3437
02:43:39.911 --> 02:43:43.001
<v Speaker 1>to just low carb I think is an outgrowth</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it being so satiating that you under </v>

3438
02:43:44.390 --> 02:43:49.390
<v Speaker 1>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you are hypo caloric for too </v>

3439
02:43:49.390 --> 02:43:49.850
<v Speaker 1>often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too long,</v>

3440
02:43:50.390 --> 02:43:52.580
<v Speaker 1>the net can be a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have issues with that.</v>

3441
02:43:52.950 --> 02:43:53.880
<v Speaker 1>I eat like a pig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

3442
02:43:53.881 --> 02:43:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3443
02:43:54.100 --> 02:43:59.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've definitely lost weight by </v>

3444
02:43:59.100 --> 02:44:02.021
<v Speaker 2>changing my diet to that ketogenic diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've met so many people on the </v>

3445
02:44:02.021 --> 02:44:06.491
<v Speaker 2>roads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many people want a mountain about </v>

3446
02:44:06.491 --> 02:44:06.491
<v Speaker 2>that come up to me and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>

3447
02:44:06.491 --> 02:44:06.890
<v Speaker 2>I've lost 60 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

3448
02:44:06.891 --> 02:44:08.120
<v Speaker 2>I've lost 80 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

3449
02:44:08.121 --> 02:44:11.090
<v Speaker 2>I've changed my diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drink kale shakes in the morning,</v>

3450
02:44:11.091 --> 02:44:16.091
<v Speaker 2>and now my body is just a completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>different thing and it just feels </v>

3451
02:44:16.091 --> 02:44:16.091
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It works better.</v>

3452
02:44:16.700 --> 02:44:17.690
<v Speaker 2>So important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3453
02:44:17.691 --> 02:44:22.691
<v Speaker 2>It's just so important to take care of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this meat vehicle that you're driving </v>

3454
02:44:22.691 --> 02:44:25.571
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so many people are falling prey to </v>

3455
02:44:25.571 --> 02:44:29.771
<v Speaker 2>that supermarket line of cans with shiny</v>
<v Speaker 2>colors on the labels and you get roped </v>

3456
02:44:31.191 --> 02:44:33.290
<v Speaker 2>into this idea that just because you put</v>
<v Speaker 2>it in your mouth,</v>

3457
02:44:33.291 --> 02:44:38.291
<v Speaker 2>it's food and your body is just sludge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just slugged down with all this </v>

3458
02:44:38.291 --> 02:44:39.020
<v Speaker 2>nonsense</v>

3459
02:44:39.450 --> 02:44:44.450
<v Speaker 1>in a ketogenic diet is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people that seem to never really be</v>

3460
02:44:45.391 --> 02:44:50.391
<v Speaker 1>able to get anything else to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's possible they may have some damage </v>

3461
02:44:50.391 --> 02:44:54.711
<v Speaker 1>to the hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the energy regulating centers of the </v>

3462
02:44:54.711 --> 02:44:54.720
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unclear what's going on,</v>

3463
02:44:54.721 --> 02:44:59.721
<v Speaker 1>but we we know that a key to genic diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has some really great benefits for </v>

3464
02:44:59.721 --> 02:45:01.710
<v Speaker 1>neurological conditions in general like </v>
<v Speaker 1>epilepsy.</v>

3465
02:45:01.830 --> 02:45:06.830
<v Speaker 1>Some parkinson's alzheimer's research </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going on and conditions are </v>

3466
02:45:06.830 --> 02:45:09.120
<v Speaker 1>conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's possible that these ketones may</v>

3467
02:45:09.121 --> 02:45:14.121
<v Speaker 1>be altering to the physiology of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus in such a way that we get </v>

3468
02:45:14.280 --> 02:45:17.670
<v Speaker 1>normal energy regulation of metabolism </v>
<v Speaker 1>and appetite.</v>

3469
02:45:17.671 --> 02:45:20.310
<v Speaker 1>More importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive benefits as well.</v>

3470
02:45:20.311 --> 02:45:22.290
<v Speaker 1>It's another thing when people don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have that lazy,</v>

3471
02:45:22.291 --> 02:45:24.090
<v Speaker 1>foggy feeling after meals,</v>

3472
02:45:24.140 --> 02:45:29.140
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that foggy feeling is pretty </v>

3473
02:45:29.140 --> 02:45:29.870
<v Speaker 2>substantial and really important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're someone who has to think for a</v>

3474
02:45:29.871 --> 02:45:34.640
<v Speaker 2>living that's hopefully is most most </v>
<v Speaker 2>people hopefully I think in some way,</v>

3475
02:45:34.910 --> 02:45:38.810
<v Speaker 2>but you know your brain running on </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketones,</v>

3476
02:45:39.050 --> 02:45:41.030
<v Speaker 2>that's the one of the things that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are always scared about.</v>

3477
02:45:41.031 --> 02:45:41.450
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh man,</v>

3478
02:45:41.460 --> 02:45:42.940
<v Speaker 2>your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your brain runs on sugar.</v>

3479
02:45:42.941 --> 02:45:43.050
<v Speaker 2>Sugar.</v>

3480
02:45:43.050 --> 02:45:45.630
<v Speaker 1>You need glucose to run your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not really true.</v>

3481
02:45:45.810 --> 02:45:46.980
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3482
02:45:47.460 --> 02:45:49.950
<v Speaker 1>In again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 70,</v>

3483
02:45:49.951 --> 02:45:54.300
<v Speaker 1>80 percent of the brain tends to shift </v>
<v Speaker 1>to just ketone body metabolism.</v>

3484
02:45:54.301 --> 02:45:59.301
<v Speaker 1>When you're fully keto adapted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still some of the brain that's </v>

3485
02:45:59.301 --> 02:46:02.061
<v Speaker 1>going to run on glucose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some red blood cells that are </v>

3486
02:46:02.061 --> 02:46:02.061
<v Speaker 1>going to run on glucose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the.</v>

3487
02:46:02.061 --> 02:46:04.380
<v Speaker 1>The interesting thing though is that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just have.</v>

3488
02:46:04.410 --> 02:46:06.390
<v Speaker 1>If you just look at blood glucose over </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

3489
02:46:06.391 --> 02:46:09.090
<v Speaker 1>there's a pretty cool</v>

3490
02:46:10.680 --> 02:46:15.680
<v Speaker 4>a guy went on a medically supervised </v>
<v Speaker 4>fast for 382 days and you look at his </v>

3491
02:46:16.041 --> 02:46:19.550
<v Speaker 4>blood glucose levels and is beta </v>
<v Speaker 4>hydroxybutyrate levels and whatnot.</v>

3492
02:46:19.580 --> 02:46:21.770
<v Speaker 4>Do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just drank water.</v>

3493
02:46:22.040 --> 02:46:23.710
<v Speaker 4>He drank water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had some electrolytes.</v>

3494
02:46:23.750 --> 02:46:27.350
<v Speaker 4>Day 382 days stay alive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even understand the fat.</v>

3495
02:46:27.510 --> 02:46:29.930
<v Speaker 4>What that was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy that.</v>

3496
02:46:30.530 --> 02:46:33.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it should have a picture of the guy when</v>

3497
02:46:33.031 --> 02:46:34.180
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you track it down,</v>

3498
02:46:34.181 --> 02:46:37.400
<v Speaker 4>if it was over 400 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he went from over 400,</v>

3499
02:46:37.401 --> 02:46:38.690
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>close to 500 pounds.</v>

3500
02:46:38.691 --> 02:46:43.691
<v Speaker 4>Down to 180 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he finished off like 180 pounds.</v>

3501
02:46:43.820 --> 02:46:47.090
<v Speaker 4>Guy didn't eat for 382 days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Didn't poop for almost two months.</v>

3502
02:46:47.150 --> 02:46:48.900
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He fat.</v>

3503
02:46:48.950 --> 02:46:53.950
<v Speaker 4>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He fasted for over a year and somehow </v>

3504
02:46:53.950 --> 02:46:58.061
<v Speaker 4>lived.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How far can you go without risking your </v>

3505
02:46:58.061 --> 02:46:58.061
<v Speaker 4>health?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

3506
02:46:58.061 --> 02:46:59.270
<v Speaker 4>Is there a before and after photos of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this gentleman?</v>

3507
02:46:59.480 --> 02:47:01.490
<v Speaker 4>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

3508
02:47:01.491 --> 02:47:05.750
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you go to this and just go to,</v>

3509
02:47:05.751 --> 02:47:07.280
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the images,</v>

3510
02:47:07.430 --> 02:47:11.590
<v Speaker 4>then you'll probably see like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a yeah,</v>

3511
02:47:11.591 --> 02:47:15.760
<v Speaker 4>go to images and then we'll have </v>
<v Speaker 4>something with the beta hydroxy.</v>

3512
02:47:16.590 --> 02:47:18.510
<v Speaker 4>I'm not seeing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

3513
02:47:18.970 --> 02:47:23.970
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if you knew this guy and you </v>

3514
02:47:23.970 --> 02:47:23.970
<v Speaker 4>didn't see him for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could you throw ketosis in there also?</v>

3515
02:47:26.450 --> 02:47:26.660
<v Speaker 7>S</v>

3516
02:47:27.740 --> 02:47:31.430
<v Speaker 4>amazing if you did a fifth one over </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3517
02:47:31.770 --> 02:47:32.810
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nope,</v>

3518
02:47:32.870 --> 02:47:34.130
<v Speaker 4>that one right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

3519
02:47:35.180 --> 02:47:40.180
<v Speaker 4>So blood glucose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>free fatty acids and ketone body levels </v>

3520
02:47:40.180 --> 02:47:41.510
<v Speaker 4>during his fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So his blood glucose,</v>

3521
02:47:41.511 --> 02:47:46.511
<v Speaker 4>that second from the top line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the triangles that dropped and then was </v>

3522
02:47:46.511 --> 02:47:49.850
<v Speaker 4>just rock solid beta hydroxybutyrate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is that,</v>

3523
02:47:49.940 --> 02:47:50.690
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3524
02:47:51.110 --> 02:47:56.110
<v Speaker 4>the main ketone body that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that gets used as a fuel substrate that </v>

3525
02:47:56.110 --> 02:48:01.001
<v Speaker 4>goes up to a pretty high level higher </v>
<v Speaker 4>than what you would get under a </v>

3526
02:48:01.001 --> 02:48:02.450
<v Speaker 4>nutritional ketosis typically because </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a starvation deal.</v>

3527
02:48:02.960 --> 02:48:06.530
<v Speaker 4>Free fatty acids elevate a cdot acetate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>elevates a cdot acetate,</v>

3528
02:48:06.531 --> 02:48:08.750
<v Speaker 4>kind of interconvert to with the beta </v>
<v Speaker 4>hydroxy butyrate.</v>

3529
02:48:08.751 --> 02:48:11.930
<v Speaker 4>But what's interesting to your point </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the mental state,</v>

3530
02:48:12.410 --> 02:48:17.410
<v Speaker 4>if we were graphing someone's blood </v>
<v Speaker 4>glucose over time for this period of 40 </v>

3531
02:48:17.410 --> 02:48:20.150
<v Speaker 4>days and they were eating normal mixed </v>
<v Speaker 4>meals,</v>

3532
02:48:20.450 --> 02:48:23.540
<v Speaker 4>that thing would be seesawing all over </v>
<v Speaker 4>the place,</v>

3533
02:48:23.670 --> 02:48:28.130
<v Speaker 4>understand how he has any glucose </v>
<v Speaker 4>because gluconeogenesis in the liver,</v>

3534
02:48:28.280 --> 02:48:33.280
<v Speaker 4>so he's he even eating a hunter like </v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely no carbohydrate at all.</v>

3535
02:48:34.470 --> 02:48:39.470
<v Speaker 4>There was a glycerol backbone of fat </v>
<v Speaker 4>that can get converted into glucose and </v>

3536
02:48:39.470 --> 02:48:44.411
<v Speaker 4>then also certain amino acids which are </v>
<v Speaker 4>gluconeogenic can get converted into </v>

3537
02:48:44.411 --> 02:48:48.731
<v Speaker 4>glucose and so the body will use those </v>
<v Speaker 4>because we still need like just making </v>

3538
02:48:48.731 --> 02:48:50.720
<v Speaker 4>dna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pentose phosphate pathway.</v>

3539
02:48:51.080 --> 02:48:53.300
<v Speaker 4>We need some glucose to be able to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3540
02:48:53.301 --> 02:48:55.300
<v Speaker 4>So like cellular replication and </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatnot.</v>

3541
02:48:55.310 --> 02:48:58.070
<v Speaker 4>But you can do that with effectively no </v>
<v Speaker 4>carb.</v>

3542
02:48:58.100 --> 02:49:02.390
<v Speaker 4>So without dietary glucose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the body converts fat to glucose,</v>

3543
02:49:02.510 --> 02:49:04.850
<v Speaker 4>some of the backbone of fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the glycerol part,</v>

3544
02:49:04.851 --> 02:49:06.470
<v Speaker 4>and then also proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3545
02:49:06.890 --> 02:49:09.480
<v Speaker 4>but with this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not even proteins unless his body's</v>

3546
02:49:09.481 --> 02:49:13.020
<v Speaker 4>eating his meat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which they probably did to some degree,</v>

3547
02:49:13.021 --> 02:49:18.021
<v Speaker 4>but this is part of the benefit of </v>
<v Speaker 4>ketosis is that it really reduces the </v>

3548
02:49:18.021 --> 02:49:21.940
<v Speaker 4>breakdown of lean body mass,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you think about it like there are</v>

3549
02:49:22.260 --> 02:49:25.410
<v Speaker 4>people who end up with these huge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3550
02:49:25.680 --> 02:49:28.410
<v Speaker 4>folds of skin that need to get it </v>
<v Speaker 4>surgically removed.</v>

3551
02:49:28.730 --> 02:49:32.460
<v Speaker 4>There was a pretty good argument that </v>
<v Speaker 4>had they used a fasting protocol instead</v>

3552
02:49:32.461 --> 02:49:35.460
<v Speaker 4>of like a low fat higher protein </v>
<v Speaker 4>protocol.</v>

3553
02:49:35.880 --> 02:49:38.700
<v Speaker 4>If that protein is still being supplied </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the diet,</v>

3554
02:49:39.090 --> 02:49:42.510
<v Speaker 4>then even though the fat goes away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you still have the protein matrix of the</v>

3555
02:49:42.511 --> 02:49:47.511
<v Speaker 4>skin and the interstitial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A connective tissue that isn't going to </v>

3556
02:49:48.001 --> 02:49:50.460
<v Speaker 4>go away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when we're more in that fasted state</v>

3557
02:49:50.461 --> 02:49:52.860
<v Speaker 4>or intermittent fasting or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>ketosis,</v>

3558
02:49:53.370 --> 02:49:57.360
<v Speaker 4>the body is turning over that protein </v>
<v Speaker 4>base and that's really important.</v>

3559
02:49:57.361 --> 02:50:02.361
<v Speaker 4>That's this apoptotic process,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you could potentially have a </v>

3560
02:50:02.361 --> 02:50:06.381
<v Speaker 4>scenario where people who are losing a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of weight if they use these fasting </v>

3561
02:50:06.381 --> 02:50:09.651
<v Speaker 4>protocols,</v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't going to need that cosmetic </v>

3562
02:50:09.651 --> 02:50:09.651
<v Speaker 4>surgery at the end to get rid of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>sales.</v>

3563
02:50:09.651 --> 02:50:10.140
<v Speaker 4>Of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of skin,</v>

3564
02:50:10.200 --> 02:50:12.420
<v Speaker 4>is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that really possible?</v>

3565
02:50:12.421 --> 02:50:13.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but has anyone done it?</v>

3566
02:50:14.700 --> 02:50:16.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's anecdotal at this point,</v>

3567
02:50:16.560 --> 02:50:20.190
<v Speaker 4>so if they've done this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why don't they do well,</v>

3568
02:50:20.191 --> 02:50:21.240
<v Speaker 4>what happened to this gentleman?</v>

3569
02:50:21.270 --> 02:50:22.830
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy looked totally normal.</v>

3570
02:50:22.831 --> 02:50:27.831
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he was huge and then it looked </v>

3571
02:50:27.831 --> 02:50:27.831
<v Speaker 4>totally normal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You didn't have ridiculous lose fat,</v>

3572
02:50:27.831 --> 02:50:28.950
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Flying squirrels skin.</v>

3573
02:50:29.010 --> 02:50:34.010
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas like a lot of the people that </v>

3574
02:50:34.010 --> 02:50:34.010
<v Speaker 4>you saw in like the biggest loser,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they,</v>

3575
02:50:34.010 --> 02:50:37.260
<v Speaker 4>they had that stuff and they were using </v>
<v Speaker 4>a higher carb,</v>

3576
02:50:37.620 --> 02:50:41.790
<v Speaker 4>moderate protein kind of deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry to interrupt.</v>

3577
02:50:41.791 --> 02:50:46.791
<v Speaker 4>Does your body have the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand that the skin that's hanging </v>

3578
02:50:46.791 --> 02:50:47.610
<v Speaker 4>loose is not necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3579
02:50:47.940 --> 02:50:49.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just kind of mechanical receptors.</v>

3580
02:50:49.831 --> 02:50:52.650
<v Speaker 4>This piezoelectric effect effective </v>
<v Speaker 4>feedback of all that.</v>

3581
02:50:52.680 --> 02:50:54.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about people that have lost all the</v>

3582
02:50:54.871 --> 02:50:59.871
<v Speaker 4>weight in another fashion and now </v>
<v Speaker 4>they've gotten to them themselves into </v>

3583
02:50:59.871 --> 02:51:01.320
<v Speaker 4>this really thin body with all this </v>
<v Speaker 4>extra skin?</v>

3584
02:51:01.321 --> 02:51:06.321
<v Speaker 4>Could they go on a fasting protocol then</v>
<v Speaker 4>and would the body absorb that skin </v>

3585
02:51:06.321 --> 02:51:08.850
<v Speaker 4>tissue first before it started eating up</v>
<v Speaker 4>the muscle tissue height?</v>

3586
02:51:09.210 --> 02:51:14.210
<v Speaker 4>Possibly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the challenge with that is it </v>

3587
02:51:14.210 --> 02:51:14.880
<v Speaker 4>because they've already decrease their </v>
<v Speaker 4>fat mass,</v>

3588
02:51:14.881 --> 02:51:18.150
<v Speaker 4>like are they now leading this into an </v>
<v Speaker 4>unhealthy state?</v>

3589
02:51:18.151 --> 02:51:19.740
<v Speaker 4>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if they decided,</v>

3590
02:51:19.890 --> 02:51:24.890
<v Speaker 4>let me fatten up again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like maybe the move would be to fatten </v>

3591
02:51:24.890 --> 02:51:28.761
<v Speaker 4>up again and get yourself obese again </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then go on this.</v>

3592
02:51:28.890 --> 02:51:33.890
<v Speaker 4>I meAn you're laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but honestly wouldn't that be the move </v>

3593
02:51:33.890 --> 02:51:36.381
<v Speaker 4>to get yourself fat again and then going</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a fasting like this guy's monitoring </v>

3594
02:51:36.661 --> 02:51:41.661
<v Speaker 4>medical medically monitored fasting and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then your body would absorb the fat </v>

3595
02:51:41.661 --> 02:51:44.370
<v Speaker 4>again and the skin tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I would.</v>

3596
02:51:44.430 --> 02:51:45.780
<v Speaker 4>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting.</v>

3597
02:51:45.781 --> 02:51:47.340
<v Speaker 4>I would have never thought about doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3598
02:51:47.341 --> 02:51:51.000
<v Speaker 4>I would maybe think about like two or </v>
<v Speaker 4>three days a week of fasting,</v>

3599
02:51:51.290 --> 02:51:55.200
<v Speaker 4>so some intermittent fasting and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>you get into some normal eating and then</v>

3600
02:51:55.230 --> 02:52:00.230
<v Speaker 4>even what you could do is you could go a</v>
<v Speaker 4>two or three days of fasting or a very </v>

3601
02:52:01.771 --> 02:52:06.771
<v Speaker 4>low calorie intake and then at the end </v>
<v Speaker 4>of that period you could just be very </v>

3602
02:52:06.771 --> 02:52:10.921
<v Speaker 4>low protein and then maybe four out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the five days,</v>

3603
02:52:11.321 --> 02:52:16.321
<v Speaker 4>four out of seven days your low protein </v>
<v Speaker 4>and two or three of those days you're </v>

3604
02:52:16.321 --> 02:52:17.560
<v Speaker 4>super low calorie.</v>

3605
02:52:17.620 --> 02:52:18.880
<v Speaker 4>What have you tried that and it didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>work.</v>

3606
02:52:18.881 --> 02:52:21.640
<v Speaker 4>You still got that floppy skin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then it would suck.</v>

3607
02:52:21.641 --> 02:52:24.580
<v Speaker 4>You'd be driving and this guy might have</v>
<v Speaker 4>it nailed.</v>

3608
02:52:24.610 --> 02:52:25.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3609
02:52:25.660 --> 02:52:26.920
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to get fat again.</v>

3610
02:52:26.921 --> 02:52:28.480
<v Speaker 4>Folks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't get the surgery.</v>

3611
02:52:28.481 --> 02:52:31.300
<v Speaker 4>Just get fat again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't say that to people though.</v>

3612
02:52:31.301 --> 02:52:36.301
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to say because nobody wants to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do that because it's so hard to lose </v>

3613
02:52:36.301 --> 02:52:36.301
<v Speaker 4>that weight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3614
02:52:36.430 --> 02:52:40.090
<v Speaker 4>Once you lost that kind of so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when people do get that operation,</v>

3615
02:52:40.091 --> 02:52:42.190
<v Speaker 4>when they cut their skin and it's really</v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous,</v>

3616
02:52:42.470 --> 02:52:45.340
<v Speaker 4>super dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a high risk of infection,</v>

3617
02:52:45.400 --> 02:52:46.990
<v Speaker 4>a high bleeding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3618
02:52:47.070 --> 02:52:48.930
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's horrendous.</v>

3619
02:52:49.030 --> 02:52:50.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't.</v>

3620
02:52:50.201 --> 02:52:53.470
<v Speaker 4>Usually finnish guy who got attacked </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a knife or something,</v>

3621
02:52:53.471 --> 02:52:56.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>covered in these das of sorts.</v>

3622
02:52:56.011 --> 02:52:56.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3623
02:52:56.830 --> 02:53:01.830
<v Speaker 4>Score,</v>
<v Speaker 4>score scars or either you have a book </v>

3624
02:53:01.830 --> 02:53:01.830
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3625
02:53:01.830 --> 02:53:02.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the book wired to eat.</v>

3626
02:53:03.010 --> 02:53:08.010
<v Speaker 4>Was it about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's about the neuro regulation of </v>

3627
02:53:08.010 --> 02:53:08.010
<v Speaker 4>appetite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3628
02:53:08.010 --> 02:53:08.500
<v Speaker 4>well we've been talking about a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

3629
02:53:08.501 --> 02:53:09.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3630
02:53:09.101 --> 02:53:10.720
<v Speaker 4>So I mean a bunch of the stuff like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3631
02:53:10.721 --> 02:53:15.721
<v Speaker 4>the ice cream deal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I talk about that stuff in the </v>

3632
02:53:15.721 --> 02:53:15.721
<v Speaker 4>book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3633
02:53:15.721 --> 02:53:15.721
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3634
02:53:15.721 --> 02:53:18.490
<v Speaker 4>it's steeped in this evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 4>medicine perspective,</v>

3635
02:53:18.491 --> 02:53:21.100
<v Speaker 4>but I'm really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I'm effective with this,</v>

3636
02:53:21.101 --> 02:53:26.101
<v Speaker 4>I'm really trying to decouple people are</v>
<v Speaker 4>like unpack all the emotionality that </v>

3637
02:53:26.411 --> 02:53:31.411
<v Speaker 4>they've got around food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if they've found challenges around </v>

3638
02:53:31.411 --> 02:53:34.471
<v Speaker 4>changing their diet and lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it shouldn't be a surprise and it's not </v>

3639
02:53:34.471 --> 02:53:38.611
<v Speaker 4>their fault,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at the same time I don't want them </v>

3640
02:53:38.611 --> 02:53:38.611
<v Speaker 4>to just roll over and give up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we,</v>

3641
02:53:38.611 --> 02:53:43.170
<v Speaker 4>we've got ways to move them through a </v>
<v Speaker 4>process of discovering what works for </v>

3642
02:53:43.170 --> 02:53:47.671
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what doesn't work for them and we can </v>

3643
02:53:47.671 --> 02:53:47.671
<v Speaker 4>move her forward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I would say like 50,</v>

3644
02:53:47.671 --> 02:53:50.410
<v Speaker 4>60 percent of the people that end up </v>
<v Speaker 4>failing in this process,</v>

3645
02:53:50.740 --> 02:53:54.340
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of emotional baggage type </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff and also there's this sense.</v>

3646
02:53:54.690 --> 02:53:56.680
<v Speaker 4>So when people are at jujitsu and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

3647
02:53:56.681 --> 02:53:57.730
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this shit's really hard.</v>

3648
02:53:57.731 --> 02:53:58.840
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3649
02:53:59.650 --> 02:54:01.270
<v Speaker 4>if you want to keep doing it then do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's,</v>

3650
02:54:01.540 --> 02:54:02.950
<v Speaker 4>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's always hard.</v>

3651
02:54:03.340 --> 02:54:08.340
<v Speaker 4>And similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing diet and lifestyle changes </v>

3652
02:54:08.340 --> 02:54:12.210
<v Speaker 4>frequently is pretty difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so if you can just understand that </v>

3653
02:54:12.210 --> 02:54:16.471
<v Speaker 4>and understand that that's normal and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not beating yourself up about </v>

3654
02:54:16.471 --> 02:54:19.891
<v Speaker 4>that process,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we really stand a much better </v>

3655
02:54:19.891 --> 02:54:21.490
<v Speaker 4>chance of turning that corner and making</v>
<v Speaker 4>these effective,</v>

3656
02:54:21.491 --> 02:54:23.560
<v Speaker 4>longstanding changes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

02:54:23.561 --> 02:54:25.510
<v Speaker 4>so the book is out right now,</v>
