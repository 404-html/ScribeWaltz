<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of those because of the law.</v>

29
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.210
<v Speaker 1>When the movies came out,</v>

30
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.081
<v Speaker 1>this could be doing one,</v>

31
00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:40.201
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

32
00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:40.591
<v Speaker 1>and three.</v>

00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:46.224
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

37
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.760
<v Speaker 1>it was a really interesting,</v>

38
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:48.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

39
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

40
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.740
<v Speaker 1>documentary.</v>

41
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:50.630
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of the sea,</v>

42
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.660
<v Speaker 1>see if they say what it is,</v>

43
00:00:51.661 --> 00:00:52.021
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>

44
00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:56.070
<v Speaker 1>their name is Louise and Martine focons in their sisters that had been</v>

45
00:00:56.071 --> 00:00:58.980
<v Speaker 1>prostitutes for over 50 years.</v>

46
00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.940
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

47
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.331
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

48
00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:04.950
<v Speaker 1>it was the most creepiest documentary because they talked about how they didn't</v>

49
00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:06.240
<v Speaker 1>really want to do it anymore.</v>

50
00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:06.741
<v Speaker 1>They were kind of,</v>

51
00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:06.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.110
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

53
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.861
<v Speaker 1>I'm an old lady,</v>

54
00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:08.694
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do this.</v>

55
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.730
<v Speaker 1>But then they had to because they had no other choice because they had no money.</v>

56
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.740
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

57
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.540
<v Speaker 2>you said I was a little tired.</v>

58
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:19.683
<v Speaker 2>That's her quote.</v>

59
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.321
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

61
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.110
<v Speaker 2>tired.</v>

62
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.970
<v Speaker 2>Luis told as it happens,</v>

63
00:01:24.971 --> 00:01:28.720
<v Speaker 2>host Carol off in an interview that aired March 18th.</v>

64
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.120
<v Speaker 2>The sister said that old age and arthritis where the main reasons for their</v>

65
00:01:34.121 --> 00:01:34.954
<v Speaker 2>retirement,</v>

66
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.680
<v Speaker 2>and I've written about their exploits in the new book called the ladies of</v>

67
00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:39.514
<v Speaker 2>Amsterdam.</v>

68
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.360
<v Speaker 1>That's how they would walk down the street.</v>

69
00:01:41.361 --> 00:01:43.580
<v Speaker 1>And the documentary was kind of cute.</v>

70
00:01:43.581 --> 00:01:45.480
<v Speaker 1>Does cause there was so such an old ladies,</v>

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:47.661
<v Speaker 1>But it was awesome.</v>

74
00:01:47.661 --> 00:01:48.890
<v Speaker 1>Really disturbing.</v>

75
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.680
<v Speaker 1>They look like dude's pretending to be old ladies.</v>

76
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Like one of those theme movies like Benny Pills.</v>

77
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

85
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:01.020
<v Speaker 2>Look to Benny Hills and dresses.</v>

86
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.430
<v Speaker 2>Their body just becomes like a battleground and all the Siv,</v>

87
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.330
<v Speaker 2>HIV,</v>

88
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.740
<v Speaker 2>STD,</v>

89
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.640
<v Speaker 2>syphilis,</v>

90
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.271
<v Speaker 2>gonorrhea,</v>

91
00:02:09.271 --> 00:02:09.960
<v Speaker 2>aids,</v>

92
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.060
<v Speaker 2>it all just battles it out together for dominance,</v>

93
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.343
<v Speaker 2>see who wins.</v>

94
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.290
<v Speaker 2>And meanwhile she stays healthy.</v>

95
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.570
<v Speaker 2>She's tastes healthy cause they didn't attack each other.</v>

96
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.430
<v Speaker 2>They don't even go after the immune system.</v>

97
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean as if though your kids,</v>

98
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.000
<v Speaker 2>that's when it would really gross you out.</v>

99
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.650
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if you had a kid with a chick and then you weren't really that into it</v>

100
00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:35.340
<v Speaker 2>and you kinda like kept away from her and laughed and didn't pay child support</v>

101
00:02:35.341 --> 00:02:38.790
<v Speaker 2>and she went into property and then he found out many years later that your kid</v>

102
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.030
<v Speaker 2>retired as the oldest prostitute ever in Amsterdam.</v>

103
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.830
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

104
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.101

107
00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:48.961
<v Speaker 2>a little girl.</v>

108
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:51.900
<v Speaker 2>That was someone's little cute baby that was so sweet and everything she said</v>

109
00:02:51.901 --> 00:02:52.740
<v Speaker 2>was adorable.</v>

110
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:53.581
<v Speaker 2>Oh my goodness.</v>

111
00:02:53.581 --> 00:02:54.091
<v Speaker 2>Look at her.</v>

112
00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:55.140
<v Speaker 2>She's so precious.</v>

113
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.420
<v Speaker 2>Next thing you know,</v>

114
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't really end that well.</v>

115
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.503
<v Speaker 2>This story.</v>

116
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

117
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 2>how did it end?</v>

118
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

119
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.020
<v Speaker 2>do you really want to hear the end?</v>

120
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

123
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:15.703
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

124
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

125
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.110
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting when a culture like drastically changes over a fairly short</v>

126
00:03:22.111 --> 00:03:22.770
<v Speaker 3>period of time.</v>

127

<v Speaker 3>maybe like to name names late,</v>

130
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.390
<v Speaker 3>maybe even the early two thousands it was like no big deal.</v>

131
00:03:33.391 --> 00:03:33.631
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

132
