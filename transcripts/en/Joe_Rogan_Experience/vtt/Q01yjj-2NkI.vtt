<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

40
00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:19.470
<v Speaker 2>it's cool cause they just have all these,</v>

41
00:01:19.471 --> 00:01:23.130
<v Speaker 2>does that like you could put together a website and almost like within five</v>

42
00:01:23.131 --> 00:01:23.400
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>

43
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.240
<v Speaker 1>Well you have,</v>

44
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:25.500
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't,</v>

46
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.570
<v Speaker 1>it would take me a lot longer than it would take you but,</v>

47
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.530
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

48
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.980
<v Speaker 1>Brian can whip through one of those fucking things and it's um,</v>

49
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.090
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

50
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.350
<v Speaker 1>I love the fact that there's someone figure that out cause it used to be like so</v>

51
00:01:37.351 --> 00:01:37.980
<v Speaker 1>daunting.</v>

52
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.260
<v Speaker 1>The idea of creating a website was terrifying.</v>

53
00:01:40.261 --> 00:01:40.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

54
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.970
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to do with this?</v>

55
00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:42.450
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

56
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.160
<v Speaker 1>this makes it super easy.</v>

57
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.950
<v Speaker 1>It makes,</v>

58
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.820
<v Speaker 1>it's really intuitive and it works on everything.</v>

59
00:01:47.821 --> 00:01:49.110
<v Speaker 1>It works on a cell phone,</v>

60
00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:52.500
<v Speaker 1>it works in your iPad or android tablet.</v>

61
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.240
<v Speaker 1>It works on every phone.</v>

62
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.590
<v Speaker 1>It works on every browser.</v>

63
00:01:55.591 --> 00:01:56.190
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

64
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.580
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

65
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.490
<v Speaker 1>they've got it down and it didn't use to be down.</v>

66
00:01:59.491 --> 00:02:01.560
<v Speaker 1>It used to be like really difficult to get a website.</v>

67
00:02:01.561 --> 00:02:04.290
<v Speaker 1>But now almost anybody can do their own.</v>

68
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.920
<v Speaker 1>And if you go to squarespace.com forward slash Joe,</v>

85
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:38.461
<v Speaker 1>And they'll think,</v>

86
00:02:38.461 --> 00:02:39.240
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

87
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.260
<v Speaker 1>someone's just really stuck on those old march podcasts</v>

88
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.320
<v Speaker 1>were also brought to you by Tang.</v>

89
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

90
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.671
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

91
00:02:47.671 --> 00:02:48.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

92
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.260
<v Speaker 1>have heard of Tim before,</v>

93
00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:51.510
<v Speaker 1>if you've heard of us talk about on a podcast,</v>

94
00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:56.511
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that makes me so happy is when I run into people and they tell</v>

95
00:02:56.791 --> 00:03:01.791
<v Speaker 1>me that something that we're advertising in the podcast is exactly as promised.</v>

96
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.371
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

97
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

98
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing that I keep hearing about ting.</v>

99
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.921
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

100
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:06.754
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

101
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.980
<v Speaker 1>it's a really good cell phone service.</v>

102
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 1>It uses a sprint backbone,</v>

103
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's set up to be a lot cheaper than most cell phone plans.</v>

104
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.110
<v Speaker 1>And it's set up in a really cool ethical way,</v>

105
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.210
<v Speaker 1>including if you,</v>

106
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.970
<v Speaker 1>if you don't use the minutes that you signed up for,</v>

107
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:25.060
<v Speaker 1>they knock you down to the next level and credit you at your next bill.</v>

108
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.470
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

109
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.700
<v Speaker 1>they literally give you credit for anew service.</v>

110
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:27.851
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

111
00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:28.684
<v Speaker 1>nobody does that.</v>

112
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.970
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

113
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:29.920
<v Speaker 1>they don't use,</v>

114
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.450
<v Speaker 1>usually if you don't use your service,</v>

115
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.560
<v Speaker 1>they're like tough shit.</v>

116
00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:33.010
<v Speaker 1>That's what you,</v>

117
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.843
<v Speaker 1>you offered,</v>

118
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.853
<v Speaker 1>that's what you bought.</v>

119
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.380
<v Speaker 1>That was your,</v>

120
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 1>your contract was a hundred minutes a month or whenever the hell it is.</v>

121
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.340
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

122
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.310

<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>

125
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.751
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

126
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:42.610
<v Speaker 2>and when we were in Vancouver for 24 hours,</v>

127
00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:43.444
<v Speaker 2>I use both of my,</v>

128
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.080

<v Speaker 2>one from at t and t and one from a Tang.</v>

131
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.190
<v Speaker 2>And I just got the bill to find out how much my overages were for,</v>

132
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

133

136
00:03:57.941 --> 00:03:58.510
<v Speaker 2>stupid.</v>

137
00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.343
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

138
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.130
<v Speaker 2>it was 200 and like $70 or something like that.</v>

139
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.120
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.680
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

149
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.513
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>

150
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:17.480
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>

151
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:17.901
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

152
00:04:17.901 --> 00:04:19.010
<v Speaker 3>the tin can make it that cheap,</v>

153
00:04:19.011 --> 00:04:21.890
<v Speaker 3>but it's also insane that 18 tickets send you a bill that high.</v>

154
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:22.700
<v Speaker 3>It's just so,</v>

155
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.870
<v Speaker 3>it's so weird that you'd go over to Canada and all of a sudden the same rules</v>

156
00:04:26.871 --> 00:04:27.440
<v Speaker 3>don't apply.</v>

157
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.820
<v Speaker 3>It's like three hours away.</v>

158
00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:29.190
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

159
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.781
<v Speaker 3>It takes is three.</v>

160
00:04:29.781 --> 00:04:31.460
<v Speaker 3>It takes us five to get to New York.</v>

161
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:32.061
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

162
00:04:32.061 --> 00:04:33.110
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make any sense.</v>

163
00:04:33.111 --> 00:04:34.280
<v Speaker 3>It's so stupid.</v>

164
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm so tired of countries and it's really fucking stupid.</v>

165
00:04:37.371 --> 00:04:37.490
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

166
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.900
<v Speaker 2>Just at and t even doing that,</v>

167
00:04:38.901 --> 00:04:41.390
<v Speaker 2>cause they know there's people like me that wouldn't cause they watch.</v>

168
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.220
<v Speaker 2>What they want you to do is they want you to call them,</v>

169
00:04:43.221 --> 00:04:46.190
<v Speaker 2>get on a international calling plan or a data plan,</v>

170
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.100
<v Speaker 2>choose which one you want and then it would probably be cheaper.</v>

171
00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.060
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

172
00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.900
<v Speaker 2>but what they're doing,</v>

173
00:04:50.901 --> 00:04:51.231
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

174
00:04:51.231 --> 00:04:51.501
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

175
00:04:51.501 --> 00:04:53.320
<v Speaker 2>you didn't call us so we're just going to fuck you.</v>

176
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.960
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

177
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're like tanks.</v>

178
00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.461
<v Speaker 2>Just like,</v>

179
00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:56.000
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

180
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.900
<v Speaker 2>strong words,</v>

181
00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:58.480
<v Speaker 2>whatever words,</v>

182
00:04:58.481 --> 00:04:59.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

183
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.000
<v Speaker 3>they don't need to teach,</v>

184
00:05:00.001 --> 00:05:00.820
<v Speaker 3>just misunderstood.</v>

185
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.920
<v Speaker 3>They also don't charge you for teetering either,</v>

186
00:05:02.921 --> 00:05:03.820
<v Speaker 3>which is another thing.</v>

187
00:05:03.821 --> 00:05:04.571
<v Speaker 3>It's called tethering.</v>

188
00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:05.900
<v Speaker 3>Tethering either.</v>

189
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.070
<v Speaker 3>It's either one of those that you don't really say that much,</v>

190
00:05:09.071 --> 00:05:10.300
<v Speaker 3>but you see written down a lot.</v>

191
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.541
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

192
00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:11.231
<v Speaker 3>It's like something else,</v>

193
00:05:11.231 --> 00:05:12.120
<v Speaker 3>like role,</v>

194
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.170
<v Speaker 3>like some people say rolfing when it's like,</v>

195
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.550
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

196
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.383
<v Speaker 3>just rolfing,</v>

197
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.260
<v Speaker 3>the massage thing.</v>

198
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.661
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

199
00:05:17.661 --> 00:05:17.800
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

200
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.071
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

201
00:05:18.071 --> 00:05:20.020
<v Speaker 3>When you're like rolling on the floor laughing.</v>

202
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.610
<v Speaker 3>Oh Aro yeah.</v>

203
00:05:21.611 --> 00:05:22.301
<v Speaker 3>Roll on the floor.</v>

204
00:05:22.301 --> 00:05:23.200
<v Speaker 3>Laughing my ass off.</v>

205
00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

206
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.570
<v Speaker 2>So let's say that I was like,</v>

207
00:05:24.571 --> 00:05:24.811
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

208
00:05:24.811 --> 00:05:25.644
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard that.</v>

209
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.090
<v Speaker 2>But people would just spell it out.</v>

210
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

211
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:28.570
<v Speaker 2>those people.</v>

212
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.980
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

213
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.420
<v Speaker 2>like like they don't charge you for a tethering so like that,</v>

214
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.710
<v Speaker 2>which is you shouldn't have to pay for anyways.</v>

215
00:05:34.711 --> 00:05:34.951
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

216
00:05:34.951 --> 00:05:36.300
<v Speaker 2>You have to have a button,</v>

217
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.290
<v Speaker 2>that software button,</v>

218
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.370
<v Speaker 2>it turns on and off.</v>

219
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.750
<v Speaker 2>That's why you have to pay for it.</v>

220
00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:40.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

221
00:05:40.071 --> 00:05:41.720
<v Speaker 1>You have the same amount of data.</v>

222
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.000
<v Speaker 1>What do you care if I use it off my phone or my laptop?</v>

223
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.391
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

224
00:05:44.391 --> 00:05:45.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm on,</v>

225
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.430
<v Speaker 2>I have the phone I bought.</v>

226
00:05:46.431 --> 00:05:47.090
<v Speaker 2>This is my phones.</v>

227
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.380
<v Speaker 2>It's not wearing out the phone,</v>

228
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.140
<v Speaker 2>you know it's not doing,</v>

229
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.881
<v Speaker 2>there's no reason.</v>

230
00:05:49.881 --> 00:05:51.860
<v Speaker 2>But you know with the Tang they give it to you for free,</v>

231
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:52.970
<v Speaker 2>which is how it should be.</v>

232
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.251
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

233
00:05:53.251 --> 00:05:55.040

234
00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:56.840
<v Speaker 2>It comes with free stuff.</v>

235
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 2>It's ethical company</v>

236
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.641
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

237

<v Speaker 1>including the Samsung Galaxy note too,</v>

241
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:06.950
<v Speaker 1>which is that big giant thing.</v>

242
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:07.880
<v Speaker 1>That's the one that you,</v>

243
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean you really read websites on it,</v>

244
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:10.403
<v Speaker 1>take pictures with it.</v>

245
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.610
<v Speaker 1>You can watch movies on it and want looking at your photos on it as a completely</v>

246
00:06:13.611 --> 00:06:15.590
<v Speaker 1>different experience than a smaller phone.</v>

247
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:16.131
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

248
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:16.970
<v Speaker 1>the people that try it,</v>

249
00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:17.211
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

250
00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:19.730
<v Speaker 1>it's a pain in the ass for people to get used to,</v>

251
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.730
<v Speaker 1>but once they try it and they get used to that giant screen,</v>

252
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:24.910
<v Speaker 1>you don't ever want to go back to a little tiny babies Christmas.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And I know at Macy's and clubs they look like weapons but they're not weapons.</v>

294
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:34.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

295
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:35.803
<v Speaker 1>They're not,</v>

296
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:40.190
<v Speaker 1>they're just exercise equipment and it's exercise equipment that mimics the use</v>

297
00:07:40.191 --> 00:07:41.870
<v Speaker 1>of weapons because believe it or not,</v>

298
00:07:41.871 --> 00:07:44.320
<v Speaker 1>like those dudes had to like swing swords of you.</v>

299
00:07:44.321 --> 00:07:46.730
<v Speaker 1>You have to live in game of Thrones time.</v>

300
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.850
<v Speaker 1>You have to be strong as shit man to be able to swing a big giant piece of</v>

301
00:07:49.851 --> 00:07:50.684
<v Speaker 1>metal.</v>

302
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.870
<v Speaker 1>And when you not advocating any sword use,</v>

303
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.120
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying when you use something like that,</v>

304
00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:02.140
<v Speaker 1>like a steel mace or a steel club using these a weapon like pieces of exercise</v>

305
00:08:02.601 --> 00:08:03.260
<v Speaker 1>equipment,</v>

306
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.580
<v Speaker 1>it actually makes you use your body as one whole unit and it improves your</v>

307
00:08:07.581 --> 00:08:08.600
<v Speaker 1>athletic performance.</v>

308
00:08:08.601 --> 00:08:09.740
<v Speaker 1>And in other areas,</v>

309
00:08:09.741 --> 00:08:10.490
<v Speaker 1>like if you,</v>

310
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.040
<v Speaker 1>if you have a sport that you do or if it's a martial arts thing,</v>

311
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:13.821
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

312
00:08:13.821 --> 00:08:17.390
<v Speaker 1>the strength and fitness that you can get from a good kettlebell workout or a</v>

313
00:08:17.391 --> 00:08:18.260
<v Speaker 1>mace workout,</v>

314
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.221
<v Speaker 1>it really does.</v>

315

340
00:09:05.951 --> 00:09:06.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

341
00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:10.300
<v Speaker 1>there's a small handful of people that I would have liked to have meet more than</v>

342
00:09:10.301 --> 00:09:11.020
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

343
00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:11.501
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

344
00:09:11.501 --> 00:09:11.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

345
00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:16.060
<v Speaker 1>having you on the podcast the first time was a true honor and a treat and uh,</v>

346
00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:16.580
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

347
00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.100
<v Speaker 1>it's just cool to be in contact with you.</v>

348
00:09:18.101 --> 00:09:19.410
<v Speaker 1>I think you are a,</v>

349
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:20.843
<v Speaker 1>you represent,</v>

350
00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:21.950
<v Speaker 1>represent representative,</v>

351
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.960
<v Speaker 1>very positive and a very unusual force in the world of art and then the world of</v>

352
00:09:27.731 --> 00:09:28.900
<v Speaker 1>consciousness as well.</v>

353
00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:29.381
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

354
00:09:29.381 --> 00:09:29.920
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

355
00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.610
<v Speaker 1>your artwork is so uh,</v>

356
00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:36.660
<v Speaker 1>moving and so representative of the psychedelic state that it actually has like</v>

357
00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.560
<v Speaker 1>an effect on people.</v>

358
00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:39.250
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

359
00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:42.640
<v Speaker 1>I think your artwork is probably like some of the,</v>

360
00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:48.330
<v Speaker 1>the most accurate psychedelic artwork I've ever seen and I can't tell you how</v>

361
00:09:48.341 --> 00:09:52.270
<v Speaker 1>many people I've been with that have seen your artwork or seeing one of your</v>

362
00:09:52.271 --> 00:09:55.690
<v Speaker 1>pieces for the first time and just went fuck.</v>

363
00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:56.441
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

364
00:09:56.441 --> 00:09:57.850
<v Speaker 1>like that's like the,</v>

365
00:09:57.851 --> 00:09:58.331
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

366
00:09:58.331 --> 00:10:01.840
<v Speaker 1>the usual reaction when they see one of your crazier pieces.</v>

367
00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:02.501
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

368
00:10:02.501 --> 00:10:02.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

369
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.860
<v Speaker 1>the one that's like the one that I always think of when I think of you as these</v>

370
00:10:05.861 --> 00:10:06.970
<v Speaker 1>three faces,</v>

371
00:10:06.971 --> 00:10:11.260
<v Speaker 1>they look like Egyptian sort of pharaoh type faces and they're all three.</v>

372
00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:16.030
<v Speaker 1>One is facing forward and two on the sides and it just seems like a DMT trip.</v>

373
00:10:16.031 --> 00:10:17.560
<v Speaker 1>It seems like you're tripping when you're watching it.</v>

374
00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:18.460
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

375
00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:19.293
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

376
00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:24.360
<v Speaker 5>It's an attempt to point to that the embeddedness that we are in time,</v>

377
00:10:27.161 --> 00:10:28.150
<v Speaker 5>the flow of time,</v>

378
00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:32.290
<v Speaker 5>and yet there is always a timeless being that,</v>

379
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.920
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

380
00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:37.060
<v Speaker 5>we also are the witness of that,</v>

381
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:38.453
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

382
00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.970
<v Speaker 5>being in time.</v>

383
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:41.830
<v Speaker 5>Why is it so terrifying?</v>

384
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.100
<v Speaker 5>Because we are in time and there's a countdown,</v>

385
00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:45.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

386
00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:46.451
<v Speaker 5>there's a,</v>

387
00:10:46.451 --> 00:10:46.961
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

388
00:10:46.961 --> 00:10:48.630
<v Speaker 5>where none of us get out alive,</v>

389
00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:49.121
<v Speaker 5>et Cetera,</v>

390
00:10:49.121 --> 00:10:50.540
<v Speaker 5>et Cetera to do,</v>

391
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:50.801
<v Speaker 5>do,</v>

392
00:10:50.801 --> 00:10:51.101
<v Speaker 5>do,</v>

393
00:10:51.101 --> 00:10:51.291
<v Speaker 5>do,</v>

394
00:10:51.291 --> 00:10:51.760
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>

395
00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

396
00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.110
<v Speaker 5>Hey Ray.</v>

397
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:53.501
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

398
00:10:53.501 --> 00:10:54.334
<v Speaker 5>we love you.</v>

399
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

400
00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:56.133
<v Speaker 5>Mm.</v>

401
00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:56.730
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

402
00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:56.910
<v Speaker 5>Just</v>

403
00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:57.743
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

404
00:10:57.830 --> 00:10:58.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

405
00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:58.651
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

406
00:10:58.651 --> 00:10:59.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

407
00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:04.140
<v Speaker 1>it really is a weird thing though to see it so clearly captured in artwork and</v>

408
00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:10.350
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the weirdest things that people point to when they point to a either</v>

409
00:11:10.351 --> 00:11:12.030
<v Speaker 1>ancient religious art or,</v>

410
00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:13.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

411
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:14.910
<v Speaker 1>just various,</v>

412
00:11:14.911 --> 00:11:15.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

413
00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:15.630
<v Speaker 1>things that were,</v>

414
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:17.520
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to find you,</v>

415
00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:17.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

416
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:19.770
<v Speaker 1>evidence of psychedelic use.</v>

417
00:11:19.771 --> 00:11:21.090
<v Speaker 1>And there are like,</v>

418
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:21.953
<v Speaker 1>they didn't,</v>

419
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.481
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

420
00:11:22.481 --> 00:11:26.580
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to find moments where they cat like this is one is hard.</v>

421
00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:27.000
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

422
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:27.690
<v Speaker 1>there was none,</v>

423
00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:31.320
<v Speaker 1>nothing like this that came out of the old world.</v>

424
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:33.930
<v Speaker 1>And it's fascinating to me because if,</v>

425
00:11:33.931 --> 00:11:34.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

426
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Mckenna was right with this height be of the stoned ape theory,</v>

427
00:11:38.161 --> 00:11:38.720
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

428
00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.550
<v Speaker 1>that mushrooms probably shaped human culture.</v>

429
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:42.391
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

430
00:11:42.391 --> 00:11:46.140
<v Speaker 1>clearly there were long periods of time probably where people weren't getting</v>

431
00:11:46.141 --> 00:11:46.974
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

432
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:48.933
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

433
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.690
<v Speaker 1>but there was a,</v>

434
00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:53.740
<v Speaker 1>a continual evolution of the,</v>

435
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:55.023
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

436
00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.233
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

437
00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:59.410
<v Speaker 5>ability to express,</v>

438
00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:00.550
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

439
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:05.550
<v Speaker 5>the dimensions of the world and of the imagine a world.</v>

440
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:08.950
<v Speaker 5>And you can see it from cave aren't,</v>

441
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:13.980
<v Speaker 5>which they now believe that even the neanderthal may have had a early form of</v>

442
00:12:17.381 --> 00:12:18.214
<v Speaker 5>cave art.</v>

443
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.980
<v Speaker 5>So it wasn't just the Cro Max,</v>

444
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:21.401
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

445
00:12:21.401 --> 00:12:21.730
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

446
00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:22.271
<v Speaker 5>and the,</v>

447
00:12:22.271 --> 00:12:23.104
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

448
00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:24.123
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

449
00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:24.910
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

450
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:25.331
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

451
00:12:25.331 --> 00:12:25.780
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

452
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:29.590
<v Speaker 5>we may have had ancestors who were also aren't us.</v>

453
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:30.863
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

454
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:35.940
<v Speaker 6>It's the cave art is one of the weirder things about ancient man.</v>

455
00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.030
<v Speaker 6>If you've seen the Werner Herzog documentary about,</v>

456
00:12:39.031 --> 00:12:39.260
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

457
00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:40.320
<v Speaker 6>the ancient cave art,</v>

458
00:12:40.321 --> 00:12:41.310
<v Speaker 6>I believe is in France.</v>

459
00:12:41.311 --> 00:12:41.970
<v Speaker 6>Is that where it was?</v>

460
00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:42.450
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

461
00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:43.021
<v Speaker 6>What is it called?</v>

462
00:12:43.021 --> 00:12:44.010
<v Speaker 6>Cave of dreams?</v>

463
00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:44.933
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

464
00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.673
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

465
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:47.543
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

466
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:52.170
<v Speaker 5>I actually didn't see it and I've heard all about it and I really want to,</v>

467
00:12:52.171 --> 00:12:52.531
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

468
00:12:52.531 --> 00:12:53.430
<v Speaker 5>and I haven't yet,</v>

469
00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:53.990
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>

470
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.160
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

471
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.140
<v Speaker 6>it's one of those things.</v>

472
00:12:55.141 --> 00:12:55.470
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

473
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:56.220
<v Speaker 6>Did you love it?</v>

474
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:56.940
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

475
00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.000
<v Speaker 6>I only got a chain.</v>

476
00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:58.291
<v Speaker 6>I was,</v>

477
00:12:58.291 --> 00:13:00.390
<v Speaker 6>I was running out the door when it was on,</v>

478
00:13:00.391 --> 00:13:02.580
<v Speaker 6>so I only got a chance to see it for about an hour.</v>

479
00:13:02.581 --> 00:13:06.930
<v Speaker 6>But it was fascinating just the idea that they were painting these incredible</v>

480
00:13:06.931 --> 00:13:09.270
<v Speaker 6>things just close to 30,000 years ago,</v>

481
00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.260
<v Speaker 6>40,000 years ago,</v>

482
00:13:10.261 --> 00:13:12.960
<v Speaker 6>something crazy like that at this is some of the oldest stuff.</v>

483
00:13:12.961 --> 00:13:17.100
<v Speaker 6>Just this is the idea that you're looking at something that someone 40,000 years</v>

484
00:13:17.101 --> 00:13:17.934
<v Speaker 6>ago drew,</v>

485
00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.790
<v Speaker 6>it seems so insane,</v>

486
00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.190
<v Speaker 6>but it also seems like a blip.</v>

487
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:28.820
<v Speaker 6>Really stop and think about 43,000 years to go from that to us from,</v>

488
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:32.190
<v Speaker 6>from drawing on rocks as being,</v>

489
00:13:32.191 --> 00:13:32.431
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

490
00:13:32.431 --> 00:13:32.731
<v Speaker 6>your,</v>

491
00:13:32.731 --> 00:13:37.650
<v Speaker 6>your main form of expression and like drawing buffalo to 40,000 years later,</v>

492
00:13:37.651 --> 00:13:40.590
<v Speaker 6>taking pictures of yourself and sending them to people on the other side of the</v>

493
00:13:40.591 --> 00:13:41.424
<v Speaker 6>planet.</v>

494
00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:44.220
<v Speaker 6>So it's not that far.</v>

495
00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.760
<v Speaker 6>30,000 years is like really quick to do that.</v>

496
00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:48.761
<v Speaker 5>Jill.</v>

497
00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:49.920
<v Speaker 5>Making pictures.</v>

498
00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:50.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

499
00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:54.270
<v Speaker 5>And making pictures is becoming an even more important,</v>

500
00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:54.870
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

501
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:56.340
<v Speaker 5>part of communication.</v>

502
00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:00.970
<v Speaker 6>What do you think that it that is that feeling that you get when you see a piece</v>

503
00:14:00.971 --> 00:14:01.570
<v Speaker 6>of art?</v>

504
00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:03.220
<v Speaker 6>When you see something beautiful,</v>

505
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.100
<v Speaker 6>when you see something that even if it's the same feeling,</v>

506
00:14:06.101 --> 00:14:08.860
<v Speaker 6>for me it's almost exactly the same thing.</v>

507
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:10.060
<v Speaker 6>When I see nature,</v>

508
00:14:10.061 --> 00:14:14.140
<v Speaker 6>a beautiful scene in nature as I see a beautiful human creation.</v>

509
00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:17.770
<v Speaker 6>So that seems to have no differentiation.</v>

510
00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.450
<v Speaker 6>And in my imagination,</v>

511
00:14:19.451 --> 00:14:23.440
<v Speaker 6>when I see like a beautiful sunset or a beautiful forest,</v>

512
00:14:23.441 --> 00:14:24.274
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

513
00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.020
<v Speaker 6>in the mountains in a lake and that,</v>

514
00:14:26.021 --> 00:14:27.670
<v Speaker 6>that perfect classic scene,</v>

515
00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.790
<v Speaker 6>or if I see a beautiful painting or a beautiful piece of art,</v>

516
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.960
<v Speaker 6>it's the same thing.</v>

517
00:14:31.961 --> 00:14:32.741
<v Speaker 6>It gives you that,</v>

518
00:14:32.741 --> 00:14:33.520
<v Speaker 6>wow.</v>

519
00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.500
<v Speaker 6>That that's what we're looking for all the time.</v>

520
00:14:35.501 --> 00:14:38.170
<v Speaker 6>This also expression,</v>

521
00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:38.400
<v Speaker 6>we</v>

522
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.270
<v Speaker 5>crave it.</v>

523
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.730
<v Speaker 5>I think it's actually something that,</v>

524
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:42.743
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

525
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:43.920
<v Speaker 5>human beings,</v>

526
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:44.730
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

527
00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:49.730
<v Speaker 5>either secretly or not so secretly crave and,</v>

528
00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:50.930
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

529
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.450
<v Speaker 5>looking at other people and in,</v>

530
00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.710
<v Speaker 5>and in finding it,</v>

531
00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:55.810
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

532
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.170
<v Speaker 5>in their lives.</v>

533
00:14:57.171 --> 00:14:58.880
<v Speaker 5>I kind of think that's a,</v>

534
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.250
<v Speaker 5>that's almost an aesthetic,</v>

535
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.150
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

536
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:07.150
<v Speaker 5>and spiritual quest in itself to find the beauty in the moment in every moment</v>

537
00:15:08.421 --> 00:15:09.450
<v Speaker 5>is actually a,</v>

538
00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:09.820
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

539
00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:10.653
<v Speaker 5>quite a,</v>

540
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.863
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

541
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:13.603
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

542
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.380
<v Speaker 5>profound,</v>

543
00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:16.190
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

544
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:17.270
<v Speaker 5>state to be.</v>

545
00:15:17.271 --> 00:15:17.960
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

546
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:18.560
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

547
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.393
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

548
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:22.820
<v Speaker 5>It's just such a strange thing to be able to do.</v>

549
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.331
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

550
00:15:23.331 --> 00:15:24.530
<v Speaker 5>if you looked at it out,</v>

551
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.350
<v Speaker 5>if you were outside of human culture and you said,</v>

552
00:15:27.351 --> 00:15:28.280
<v Speaker 5>what are they doing there?</v>

553
00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:31.910
<v Speaker 5>They're creating beautiful things and they'll look at it and get a positive</v>

554
00:15:31.911 --> 00:15:32.744
<v Speaker 5>feeling from it.</v>

555
00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:33.643
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>

556
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:38.990
<v Speaker 5>Like that image serves no other function other than the express themselves.</v>

557
00:15:38.991 --> 00:15:39.291
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

558
00:15:39.291 --> 00:15:40.124
<v Speaker 5>they can't eat it.</v>

559
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:40.910
<v Speaker 5>They can't,</v>

560
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:41.271
<v Speaker 5>they can't,</v>

561
00:15:41.271 --> 00:15:42.710
<v Speaker 5>they don't make houses out of it.</v>

562
00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:43.340
<v Speaker 5>They're just,</v>

563
00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.650
<v Speaker 5>just make it and they look at it and stare at it and they think it's awesome.</v>

564
00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:47.443
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

565
00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:47.901
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

566
00:15:47.901 --> 00:15:49.640
<v Speaker 5>in the back of the dollar bill,</v>

567
00:15:49.641 --> 00:15:54.641
<v Speaker 5>they have that some masonic looking at pyramid with the eye and the triangle</v>

568
00:15:55.761 --> 00:15:56.840
<v Speaker 5>floating above.</v>

569
00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.920
<v Speaker 5>And so it's an unfinished pyramid.</v>

570
00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:06.070
<v Speaker 5>And I've heard it interpreted as the individual or the nation is incomplete</v>

571
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:09.170
<v Speaker 5>without guidance,</v>

572
00:16:09.171 --> 00:16:10.430
<v Speaker 5>by higher vision.</v>

573
00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.500
<v Speaker 5>And so the,</v>

574
00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:13.070
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

575
00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:18.070
<v Speaker 5>aspiration for a higher vision is what distinguishes may be a sacred art and,</v>

576
00:16:19.851 --> 00:16:20.470
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

577
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:25.470
<v Speaker 5>a psychedelic aren't that aims at a universal kind of mystical visionary</v>

578
00:16:27.681 --> 00:16:30.410
<v Speaker 5>experience and uh,</v>

579
00:16:30.411 --> 00:16:33.590
<v Speaker 5>just kind of fantasy art at,</v>

580
00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:34.820
<v Speaker 5>cause I think that,</v>

581
00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:35.993
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

582
00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.740
<v Speaker 5>with the widespread use of psychedelics,</v>

583
00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:40.310
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

584
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:45.310
<v Speaker 5>so many people have seen these realms that that's why that it causes a bit of a,</v>

585
00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:48.860
<v Speaker 5>when people see it,</v>

586
00:16:48.861 --> 00:16:52.310
<v Speaker 5>sometimes it's because they've seen it inside themselves,</v>

587
00:16:52.311 --> 00:16:54.650
<v Speaker 5>but maybe not outside of themselves.</v>

588
00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:56.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

589
00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.710
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like a,</v>

590
00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.510
<v Speaker 5>like a familiar image.</v>

591
00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:03.940
<v Speaker 5>Like even though it's so bizarrely outrageous and you just to like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>what is it about?</v>

597
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:09.950
<v Speaker 5>Especially that one with the three heads,</v>

598
00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:12.440
<v Speaker 5>but that one really knocked my socks off.</v>

<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

607

00:17:25.551 --> 00:17:27.320
<v Speaker 5>I know 20 foot heads.</v>

609
00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:30.110
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be the coolest place on the planet earth.</v>

610
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:31.280
<v Speaker 5>That is,</v>

611
00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:35.780
<v Speaker 5>that is without a doubt going to be the coolest building on the planet earth.</v>

612
00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:37.760
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing cooler than that.</v>

<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

614
00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:38.471
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

615
00:17:38.471 --> 00:17:40.040
<v Speaker 5>you made an Alex Gray building</v>

616
00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.890
<v Speaker 5>and an Allison gray building.</v>

617
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:44.263
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>it's exactly,</v>

619
00:17:45.711 --> 00:17:49.740
<v Speaker 5>this is her writing cred language that uh,</v>

620
00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:53.580
<v Speaker 5>the thing that binds the building</v>

621
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:57.860
<v Speaker 1>that looks great out of a piece of the wreckage from Roswell.</v>

622
00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.380
<v Speaker 1>That's what I would expect that writing to come from.</v>

623
00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:02.630
<v Speaker 1>That looks awesome.</v>

624
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:05.330
<v Speaker 1>If human language that's looks like some,</v>

625
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:06.350
<v Speaker 1>like something,</v>

626
00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:07.700
<v Speaker 1>someone would get tattooed on them,</v>

627
00:18:07.701 --> 00:18:08.660
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't even know what it meant.</v>

628
00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:09.920
<v Speaker 1>It just looks so cool.</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

632
00:18:12.301 --> 00:18:15.850

633
00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:17.070
<v Speaker 5>and then it could,</v>

634
00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.470
<v Speaker 5>it could go completely around the body.</v>

635
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:19.831
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

636

<v Speaker 1>everybody has always said that.</v>

658
00:18:51.351 --> 00:18:54.620
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't it be amazing if somebody created a religion that,</v>

659
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:55.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

660
00:18:55.070 --> 00:19:00.070
<v Speaker 1>actually wasn't based on anything ancient or based on trying to get your money,</v>

661
00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:05.260
<v Speaker 1>but based on the true principles of love and the word that you like to use all</v>

662
00:19:07.011 --> 00:19:07.401
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>

667
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:13.341
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

668
00:19:13.341 --> 00:19:14.174
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

671
00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:15.910
<v Speaker 1>it's a kind of a,</v>

672
00:19:15.911 --> 00:19:20.240
<v Speaker 1>an amazing thing to do and know because I know you and I know like what you're</v>

673

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:23.690
<v Speaker 1>You're not doing this for any nefarious reasons.</v>

675
00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.700

676
00:19:25.701 --> 00:19:29.790
<v Speaker 1>And that's really rare where someone has a voice and the,</v>

677
00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.260
<v Speaker 1>they choose to just go all in like that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You've created a religion,</v>

679
00:19:35.061 --> 00:19:35.894
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 5>religion,</v>

688
00:19:47.031 --> 00:19:49.160
<v Speaker 5>because that's a,</v>

689
00:19:49.161 --> 00:19:50.420
<v Speaker 5>within the,</v>

690

695
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:10.330
<v Speaker 5>And the Internet has helped us all to form an image of a networked,</v>

696
00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:16.660
<v Speaker 5>kind of a distributed intelligence that goes all around the world.</v>

697

<v Speaker 5>And that's happened before people even realized it.</v>

698
00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:24.200
<v Speaker 5>It's already crept up on people.</v>

00:20:25.281 --> 00:20:29.180
<v Speaker 5>it's now kind of the ocean in which we swim.</v>

702
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:32.000
<v Speaker 5>But by making note of it,</v>

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

747
00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:35.720
<v Speaker 1>and you were,</v>

748
00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:38.770
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing is essentially you're building a temple.</v>

749
00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:42.580
<v Speaker 1>You're building a work of art that it really,</v>

750
00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:47.940
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of fascinating because if a lot of people who believed that</v>

751
00:21:48.461 --> 00:21:52.240
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic drugs are at the heart of almost all religions and psychedelic</v>

752
00:21:52.241 --> 00:21:53.920
<v Speaker 1>experience and psychedelic imagery,</v>

753
00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:54.821
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

754
00:21:54.821 --> 00:21:55.061
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

755
00:21:55.061 --> 00:21:56.620
<v Speaker 1>in ancient religious artwork where,</v>

756
00:21:56.621 --> 00:21:56.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

757
00:21:56.801 --> 00:22:00.250
<v Speaker 1>there's the things that represent mushrooms and shapes that are mushrooms,</v>

758
00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:01.451
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

759
00:22:01.451 --> 00:22:02.284
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

760
00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:06.310
<v Speaker 1>incredible buildings that have been built for religion.</v>

761
00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:06.641
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

762
00:22:06.641 --> 00:22:09.640
<v Speaker 1>if you really stop and think about some of the greatest architectural</v>

763
00:22:09.641 --> 00:22:10.474
<v Speaker 1>achievements,</v>

764
00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:14.020
<v Speaker 1>it's been like the most beautiful ones have been the ones that were created for</v>

765
00:22:14.021 --> 00:22:14.854
<v Speaker 1>religions.</v>

766
00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:15.971
<v Speaker 1>It's like they,</v>

767
00:22:15.971 --> 00:22:16.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

768
00:22:16.451 --> 00:22:20.410
<v Speaker 1>and it wanting in whatever part of what they are that is good,</v>

769
00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:23.620
<v Speaker 1>wanting to achieve some higher level.</v>

770
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:25.240
<v Speaker 1>They've done it with their art,</v>

771
00:22:25.241 --> 00:22:25.631
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

772
00:22:25.631 --> 00:22:26.500
<v Speaker 1>the architecture,</v>

773
00:22:26.501 --> 00:22:27.281
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>

774
00:22:27.281 --> 00:22:30.580
<v Speaker 1>Look at some of the ancient Roman architecture that's dedicated to the Catholic</v>

775
00:22:30.581 --> 00:22:30.881
<v Speaker 1>church.</v>

776
00:22:30.881 --> 00:22:35.080
<v Speaker 1>It's staggering stuff outside of the creepiness of the Catholic Church,</v>

777
00:22:35.081 --> 00:22:36.250
<v Speaker 1>which is undeniable.</v>

778
00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.240
<v Speaker 1>And I came from it,</v>

779
00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:38.980
<v Speaker 1>did the artwork,</v>

780
00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:41.410
<v Speaker 1>the architectural artwork is just masterful.</v>

781
00:22:41.411 --> 00:22:42.670
<v Speaker 1>It's stunning.</v>

782
00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:44.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like nothing else,</v>

783

<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

802

<v Speaker 5>So you spun around a little bit and got to see the,</v>

811
00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:28.980
<v Speaker 5>the all the heads and it's cool.</v>

<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

814
00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:33.150

<v Speaker 5>you're going to be on view in the,</v>

818
00:23:35.791 --> 00:23:36.540
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

819
00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:37.680
<v Speaker 5>within Antionne</v>

820
00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:38.210
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>

821
00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:40.370
<v Speaker 1>you could change people's lives just with these pictures.</v>

822
00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:42.350
<v Speaker 1>There's so trippy.</v>

823
00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:46.580
<v Speaker 1>They make you like that one right there that makes you go what is real and</v>

824
00:23:46.581 --> 00:23:47.510
<v Speaker 1>what's not real.</v>

825
00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:48.770
<v Speaker 1>That thinks too freaky.</v>

826
00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:50.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

827
00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:51.890
<v Speaker 1>And what is reality?</v>

828
00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.590
<v Speaker 1>Why is that image so familiar?</v>

829
00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:58.260
<v Speaker 5>Cause we aren't connected with everything.</v>

830
00:23:58.290 --> 00:23:58.860
<v Speaker 5>You know.</v>

831
00:23:58.860 --> 00:23:59.940
<v Speaker 5>I mean all look,</v>

832
00:23:59.941 --> 00:24:00.980
<v Speaker 5>all the mistake,</v>

833
00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:01.560
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

834
00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:05.910
<v Speaker 5>traditions talk about there's only one of us,</v>

835
00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:07.793
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

836
00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:08.401
<v Speaker 5>all of them.</v>

837
00:24:08.401 --> 00:24:09.234
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

838
00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:11.100
<v Speaker 5>And so that,</v>

839
00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.270
<v Speaker 5>that's the foundation of the understanding,</v>

840
00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:15.990
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

841
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.860
<v Speaker 5>is uh,</v>

842
00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:18.210
<v Speaker 5>a sense of oneness.</v>

843
00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:19.770
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

844
00:24:19.771 --> 00:24:24.771
<v Speaker 5>so the idea of the network itself and uh,</v>

845
00:24:25.461 --> 00:24:25.580
<v Speaker 5>have,</v>

846
00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:25.890
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

847
00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:27.000
<v Speaker 5>a planetary,</v>

848
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:32.200
<v Speaker 5>a sense of humanity is I think wearing away the a nationhood and nation state,</v>

849
00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:37.290
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

850
00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:38.123
<v Speaker 5>ideal,</v>

851
00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:38.851
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

852
00:24:38.851 --> 00:24:39.331
<v Speaker 5>toward,</v>

853
00:24:39.331 --> 00:24:39.710
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

854
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:40.530
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

855
00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:40.651
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

856
00:24:40.651 --> 00:24:43.020
<v Speaker 5>hopeful and democratic,</v>

857
00:24:43.021 --> 00:24:45.000
<v Speaker 5>but we'll struggle for some time.</v>

858
00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:46.160
<v Speaker 5>Was that,</v>

859
00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:46.491
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

860
00:24:46.491 --> 00:24:47.840
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a possibility.</v>

861
00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:48.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

862
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.490
<v Speaker 1>I have hope for people.</v>

863
00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:50.151
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

864
00:24:50.151 --> 00:24:50.251
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

865
00:24:50.251 --> 00:24:53.840
<v Speaker 1>and I think the Internet is what gives me the most hope because I think that</v>

866
00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:54.170
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

867
00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:58.880
<v Speaker 1>it's the first time people who have ever had a straight pipe to the world.</v>

868
00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:03.680
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has a straight pipe to everybody else and information is settling and</v>

869
00:25:03.681 --> 00:25:07.850
<v Speaker 1>people are starting to understand that they are a greater understanding of what</v>

870
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.570
<v Speaker 1>constitutes a happy life and how to achieve happiness and how,</v>

871
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:15.440
<v Speaker 1>how to surround yourself with positive people and how to,</v>

872
00:25:15.441 --> 00:25:15.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

873
00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:18.800
<v Speaker 1>how to express yourself in a healthy way.</v>

874
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:20.630
<v Speaker 1>And that's all the Internet.</v>

875
00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:21.920
<v Speaker 1>The Internet has given people,</v>

876
00:25:21.921 --> 00:25:22.311
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

877
00:25:22.311 --> 00:25:24.640
<v Speaker 1>a way better understanding of,</v>

878
00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.650
<v Speaker 1>of life itself than any generation has ever had before.</v>

879
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:31.300
<v Speaker 1>And so to have this and to create it with</v>

880
00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:32.213
<v Speaker 5>the Internet,</v>

<v Speaker 5>it's kind of perfect.</v>

<v Speaker 5>psychedelics.</v>

1126

1127
00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:20.500
<v Speaker 6>you feel like that was the heart of all organized religion that originally it</v>

<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1137
00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:45.970
<v Speaker 5>that could have been a natural part of life.</v>

1138
00:33:45.971 --> 00:33:46.391

1142
00:33:52.811 --> 00:33:54.190
<v Speaker 5>and Lo and behold,</v>

1143

<v Speaker 5>there's a vision and an angel appears</v>

1144
00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.980
<v Speaker 6>would say,</v>

1145
00:33:57.980 --> 00:33:58.131
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

1146

<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1150
00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:03.890
<v Speaker 6>Or just not worth the s and,</v>

1151
00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:04.760
<v Speaker 6>and dob.</v>

1152
00:34:04.761 --> 00:34:05.594
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1153
00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:08.990
<v Speaker 6>Soon so you can go to the edge and see</v>

1154
00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:10.610
<v Speaker 5>the other world as well.</v>

1155
00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:11.803
<v Speaker 5>And that,</v>

1156
00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:12.770
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1157
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:14.600
<v Speaker 5>can be valid as well.</v>

1158
00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:15.531
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

1159
00:34:15.531 --> 00:34:16.110
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1160
00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:16.490
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1161
00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:17.323
<v Speaker 6>these people,</v>

1162
00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.250
<v Speaker 6>one of the weird things about psychedelics is people always,</v>

1163
00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:23.370
<v Speaker 6>even if it was one of the most profound experiences ever,</v>

1164
00:34:23.371 --> 00:34:25.110
<v Speaker 6>and one the most amazing experiences ever,</v>

1165
00:34:25.410 --> 00:34:26.250
<v Speaker 6>people will tell you,</v>

1166
00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:27.031
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1167
00:34:27.031 --> 00:34:29.850
<v Speaker 6>but it was just your mind playing tricks on you.</v>

1168
00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:32.490
<v Speaker 6>Like it doesn't matter and you can go okay.</v>

1169
00:34:32.491 --> 00:34:34.260
<v Speaker 6>But it's whether it was,</v>

1170
00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:38.730
<v Speaker 6>whether I really did travel to another dimension and communicate with infinite</v>

1171
00:34:38.731 --> 00:34:42.900
<v Speaker 6>beings that were made out of love and understanding who told me the secret to</v>

1172
00:34:42.901 --> 00:34:45.390
<v Speaker 6>life is positive energy and positive.</v>

1173
00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:47.790
<v Speaker 6>Even if it was just my imagination,</v>

1174
00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:49.290
<v Speaker 6>I still experienced it.</v>

1175
00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:51.060
<v Speaker 6>I experienced it as if it was real.</v>

1176
00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:53.250
<v Speaker 6>So whether it was real or whether it wasn't real,</v>

1177
00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:54.870
<v Speaker 6>I can the exact same result.</v>

1178
00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:58.260
<v Speaker 6>Something happened that was unbelievably incredible.</v>

1179
00:34:58.261 --> 00:35:01.170
<v Speaker 6>It took me to some place that was infinitely beautiful and then something</v>

1180
00:35:01.171 --> 00:35:02.004
<v Speaker 6>happened to me.</v>

1181
00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.870
<v Speaker 6>Like either that happened or it didn't happen.</v>

1182
00:35:03.871 --> 00:35:04.830
<v Speaker 6>Well definitely happened.</v>

1183
00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.690
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't matter if it was imaginary.</v>

1184
00:35:06.691 --> 00:35:08.670
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't matter if it was only inside my head.</v>

1185
00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:11.190
<v Speaker 6>The whole world comes out of the inside of your head.</v>

1186
00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:12.180
<v Speaker 6>The,</v>

1187
00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:13.230
<v Speaker 6>when were kids.</v>

1188
00:35:13.231 --> 00:35:14.310
<v Speaker 6>I remember when I was a kid,</v>

1189
00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:15.173
<v Speaker 6>they would say like,</v>

1190
00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:15.540
<v Speaker 6>ah,</v>

1191
00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:16.740
<v Speaker 6>he's got such an imagination.</v>

1192
00:35:16.741 --> 00:35:17.190
<v Speaker 6>This one,</v>

1193
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:18.720
<v Speaker 6>it was talking about kids that were liars.</v>

1194
00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:19.740
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

1195
00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:23.300
<v Speaker 6>That's how people treated the imagination and the kids would just fibbers you</v>

1196
00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:23.551
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>

1197
00:35:23.551 --> 00:35:25.680
<v Speaker 6>because that's imagination to some people.</v>

1198
00:35:25.681 --> 00:35:25.921
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1199
00:35:25.921 --> 00:35:29.310
<v Speaker 6>some people they didn't think it was something to be encouraged,</v>

1200
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:31.620
<v Speaker 6>but it's really where everything comes from.</v>

1201
00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:36.270
<v Speaker 6>And that's the weirdest thing about it is the imagination conjures up an idea,</v>

1202
00:35:36.271 --> 00:35:37.104
<v Speaker 6>which becomes a,</v>

1203
00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:40.170
<v Speaker 6>it conjures up an idea which becomes an airplane.</v>

1204
00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.210
<v Speaker 6>It all comes from the imagination.</v>

1205
00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:43.770
<v Speaker 6>Whether it's artistic,</v>

1206
00:35:43.771 --> 00:35:44.790
<v Speaker 6>whether it's a song,</v>

1207
00:35:44.791 --> 00:35:46.790
<v Speaker 6>whether it's a joke that's,</v>

1208
00:35:46.791 --> 00:35:48.300
<v Speaker 6>it's the weirdest thing ever.</v>

1209
00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:52.170
<v Speaker 6>And everybody wants to pretend that it's so normal and so normally just thinking</v>

1210
00:35:52.171 --> 00:35:56.490
<v Speaker 6>shit up out of the middle of fucking nowhere and creating nuclear power.</v>

1211
00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:56.971
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1212
00:35:56.971 --> 00:35:57.451
<v Speaker 6>what did you do it?</v>

1213
00:35:57.451 --> 00:35:58.330
<v Speaker 6>You sat down and what,</v>

1214
00:35:58.331 --> 00:35:59.690
<v Speaker 6>you wrote some stuff on some,</v>

1215
00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:01.290
<v Speaker 6>a pad and then you figured it out.</v>

1216
00:36:01.291 --> 00:36:02.460
<v Speaker 6>Where's this all coming from?</v>

1217
00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:04.710
<v Speaker 6>Where's the idea to even do that coming from?</v>

1218
00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:06.450
<v Speaker 6>Where's the idea that some,</v>

1219
00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:09.600
<v Speaker 6>some guy wants to be like a fucking bird and put wings on and figure out how to</v>

1220
00:36:09.601 --> 00:36:09.961
<v Speaker 6>fly.</v>

1221
00:36:09.961 --> 00:36:10.950
<v Speaker 6>And he eventually figures it out.</v>

1222
00:36:10.951 --> 00:36:13.740
<v Speaker 6>And now we just travel all over the world and we don't think anything of it.</v>

1223
00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:14.731
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1224
00:36:14.731 --> 00:36:16.650
<v Speaker 6>the imagination is crazy.</v>

1225
00:36:16.651 --> 00:36:21.060
<v Speaker 6>The imagination has done some amazing things for human beings in this world.</v>

1226
00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.160
<v Speaker 6>And yet we still don't give her the credit it deserves.</v>

1227
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:24.120
<v Speaker 6>It's a,</v>

1228
00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.260
<v Speaker 6>it was kind of shocking,</v>

1229
00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:25.591
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1230
00:36:25.591 --> 00:36:26.161
<v Speaker 6>imagination.</v>

1231
00:36:26.161 --> 00:36:28.080
<v Speaker 6>It's like the most underrated thing of all time.</v>

1232
00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:32.550
<v Speaker 5>And yet it's the foundation of our advancement in evolution,</v>

1233
00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.670
<v Speaker 6>which news to work hard.</v>

1234
00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:37.310
<v Speaker 6>I don't have a fucking imagination sitting there,</v>

1235
00:36:37.311 --> 00:36:38.990
<v Speaker 6>seen some shit that's not there.</v>

1236
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:40.503
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>

1237
00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:45.460
<v Speaker 5>Well I think that that's the other thing that the,</v>

1238
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:46.180
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1239
00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:51.180
<v Speaker 5>visionary experience with psychedelic sties is it convinces people of the</v>

1240
00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:55.300
<v Speaker 5>existence of the realms.</v>

1241
00:36:55.690 --> 00:36:56.300
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1242
00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:56.560
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1243
00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:57.190
<v Speaker 5>if a,</v>

1244
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.461
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1245
00:36:57.461 --> 00:37:01.330
<v Speaker 5>suddenly find themselves in the DMT space,</v>

1246
00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:02.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1247
00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:05.170
<v Speaker 5>it's like very unsettling perhaps.</v>

1248
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.470
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1249
00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:09.310
<v Speaker 5>but then at least you can see that there is,</v>

1250
00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:10.331
<v Speaker 5>there is a,</v>

1251
00:37:10.331 --> 00:37:10.751
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

1252
00:37:10.751 --> 00:37:11.584
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

1253
00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:12.940
<v Speaker 5>there is an infinite,</v>

1254
00:37:12.941 --> 00:37:13.774
<v Speaker 5>they're there.</v>

1255
00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:14.770
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1256
00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:14.981
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1257
00:37:14.981 --> 00:37:19.981
<v Speaker 5>so this inner consciousness experience that,</v>

1258
00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:20.740
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1259
00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:21.573
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1260
00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:22.920
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1261
00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:26.140
<v Speaker 5>the one self is having through us,</v>

1262
00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:27.310
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1263
00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:31.530
<v Speaker 5>is something I'm just fascinated by it.</v>

1264
00:37:31.531 --> 00:37:34.870
<v Speaker 5>I'm fascinated by how the mystics get at the one,</v>

1265
00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.160
<v Speaker 5>do you think?</v>

1266
00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:36.641
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

1267
00:37:36.641 --> 00:37:36.860
<v Speaker 6>Listen,</v>

1268
00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:38.120
<v Speaker 6>this has always been a very,</v>

1269
00:37:38.121 --> 00:37:38.361
<v Speaker 6>a,</v>

1270
00:37:38.361 --> 00:37:41.720
<v Speaker 6>a strange one amongst the mushroom kind of sewers world.</v>

1271
00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:43.053
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1272
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:47.030
<v Speaker 6>some believe that in consuming that life form,</v>

1273
00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:50.270
<v Speaker 6>which is really closer to animal than it is to plant,</v>

1274
00:37:50.271 --> 00:37:50.541
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1275
00:37:50.541 --> 00:37:51.374
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

1276
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:52.970
<v Speaker 6>And consuming that mushroom,</v>

1277
00:37:52.971 --> 00:37:55.520
<v Speaker 6>what you're doing is that's how it communicates with you.</v>

1278
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:56.503
<v Speaker 6>That's right.</v>

1279
00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.850
<v Speaker 6>And then these visions that you're getting,</v>

1280
00:37:58.851 --> 00:38:02.360
<v Speaker 6>this information that you're getting just almost downloaded to you in a way that</v>

1281
00:38:02.361 --> 00:38:04.310
<v Speaker 6>you can't understand or even comprehend.</v>

1282
00:38:04.311 --> 00:38:05.810
<v Speaker 6>Most of it I always described,</v>

1283
00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:08.840
<v Speaker 6>tried to remember what you're learning on mushrooms,</v>

1284
00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:11.030
<v Speaker 6>like trying to grab fish in a river.</v>

1285
00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:12.010
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

1286
00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:12.843
<v Speaker 6>ah,</v>

1287
00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:15.620
<v Speaker 6>I can't fucking gravity thing.</v>

1288
00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:16.880
<v Speaker 6>I can't hold onto it.</v>

1289
00:38:16.881 --> 00:38:17.840
<v Speaker 6>It's just too crazy.</v>

1290
00:38:17.841 --> 00:38:18.710
<v Speaker 6>I'm seeing too much.</v>

1291
00:38:18.711 --> 00:38:19.640
<v Speaker 6>I'm trying to calm down,</v>

1292
00:38:19.641 --> 00:38:20.480
<v Speaker 6>but I'm saying too much.</v>

1293
00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.070
<v Speaker 6>And it's,</v>

1294
00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:23.630
<v Speaker 6>and then you've sort of go,</v>

1295
00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:23.961
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1296
00:38:23.961 --> 00:38:24.231
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

1297
00:38:24.231 --> 00:38:25.730
<v Speaker 6>This is where everything comes from,</v>

1298
00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:27.810
<v Speaker 5>comes from this crazy place.</v>

1299
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:29.023
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1300
00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:31.380
<v Speaker 5>That endless imagination and,</v>

1301
00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:31.820
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1302
00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:34.110
<v Speaker 5>in flowing streams just like that.</v>

1303
00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:37.090
<v Speaker 5>And most of the big ones get away.</v>

1304
00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:37.600
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1305
00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:38.433
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

1306
00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:39.970
<v Speaker 5>and then,</v>

1307
00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:45.030
<v Speaker 5>and then a few are just life altering and like the thing that really welded</v>

1308
00:38:46.431 --> 00:38:47.860
<v Speaker 5>Allison and I together,</v>

1309
00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:48.700
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1310
00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:49.533
<v Speaker 5>because,</v>

1311
00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:50.380
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1312
00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:55.380
<v Speaker 5>it was my first acid trip in her apartment that opened me up to,</v>

1313
00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:56.373
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1314
00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:57.130
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1315
00:38:57.130 --> 00:38:57.520
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1316
00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:02.520
<v Speaker 5>the world of light and the world of a higher possibility beyond suicide and,</v>

1317
00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:04.090
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1318
00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:05.350
<v Speaker 5>nihilism and all that.</v>

1319
00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:07.180
<v Speaker 5>It was out how you were approaching life.</v>

1320
00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:08.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1321
00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:09.603
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1322
00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:12.070
<v Speaker 5>what do you think the cause of that is,</v>

1323
00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:17.100
<v Speaker 5>is that the environmental is a behaviorals and pattern that you get into pro?</v>

1324
00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:18.400
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1325
00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:19.000
<v Speaker 5>let's see.</v>

1326
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:19.751
<v Speaker 5>I was 20,</v>

1327
00:39:19.751 --> 00:39:21.820
<v Speaker 5>21 and getting,</v>

1328
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:22.290
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1329
00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:25.420
<v Speaker 5>and probably there's something chemical going on.</v>

1330
00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:27.270
<v Speaker 5>Hormonal changes.</v>

1331
00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.980
<v Speaker 5>I was wondering whether I was crazy.</v>

1332
00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:30.880
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1333
00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:31.713
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1334
00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:32.170
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1335
00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:37.170
<v Speaker 5>I had a steady diet of a kind of nihilistic existentialist authors and it</v>

1336
00:39:39.341 --> 00:39:44.170
<v Speaker 5>reinforced the sense of absurdity because I thought that was what sophisticated,</v>

1337
00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:44.950
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1338
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:46.030
<v Speaker 5>artists would,</v>

1339
00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:46.690
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1340
00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:46.931
<v Speaker 5>put,</v>

1341
00:39:46.931 --> 00:39:48.310
<v Speaker 5>want to put into their work,</v>

1342
00:39:48.311 --> 00:39:53.311
<v Speaker 5>was a healthy dose of nihilism and cynicism and sarcasm and all that.</v>

1343
00:39:54.701 --> 00:39:55.030
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1344
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.660
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1345
00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:56.050
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1346
00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:58.570
<v Speaker 5>yet that also felt very wrong.</v>

1347
00:39:58.690 --> 00:39:59.523
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1348
00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:00.041
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1349
00:40:00.041 --> 00:40:01.600
<v Speaker 5>so it's very competitive.</v>

1350
00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:03.400
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1351
00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:03.801
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>

1352
00:40:03.801 --> 00:40:04.301
<v Speaker 5>so I,</v>

1353
00:40:04.301 --> 00:40:04.871
<v Speaker 5>anyway,</v>

1354
00:40:04.871 --> 00:40:09.250
<v Speaker 5>I was struggling with has kind of polarity kind of situation and,</v>

1355
00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:12.910
<v Speaker 5>and prone to extremes and things like that.</v>

1356
00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:13.773
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1357
00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:14.321
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1358

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.440
<v Speaker 5>And so it was kind of like a challenge.</v>

00:41:25.571 --> 00:41:26.620
<v Speaker 5>It's on the Fenway,</v>

1417
00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:27.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>where the Museum of fine artists.</v>

1421
00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:32.530
<v Speaker 5>I grew up in Newton.</v>

1422
00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:34.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1423
00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.053
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1424
00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:36.080
<v Speaker 3>I went back recently.</v>

1425
00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:37.700
<v Speaker 3>It was a really interesting,</v>

1426
00:41:37.701 --> 00:41:37.911
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

1427
00:41:37.911 --> 00:41:38.780
<v Speaker 3>we were driving around,</v>

1428
00:41:38.781 --> 00:41:39.291
<v Speaker 3>I forgot,</v>

1429
00:41:39.291 --> 00:41:42.950
<v Speaker 3>like how historic certain parts of boss God.</v>

1430
00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:43.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1431
00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:45.140
<v Speaker 3>When you look at graveyards,</v>

1432
00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.330
<v Speaker 3>graveyards that are from the 16 hundreds,</v>

1433
00:41:47.331 --> 00:41:48.111
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1434
00:41:48.111 --> 00:41:49.310
<v Speaker 3>really old buildings like,</v>

1435
00:41:49.311 --> 00:41:49.641
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1436
00:41:49.641 --> 00:41:50.301
<v Speaker 3>I forgot hot.</v>

1437
00:41:50.301 --> 00:41:51.070
<v Speaker 3>Like this is,</v>

1438
00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:52.730
<v Speaker 3>this is a historic town.</v>

1439
00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:53.270
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1440
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:56.510
<v Speaker 3>I always felt very much at home in Boston.</v>

1441
00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:59.060
<v Speaker 3>Did you hang around with any Irish drunks?</v>

1442
00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:00.050
<v Speaker 3>Cause that would change your mind,</v>

1443
00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:01.943
<v Speaker 3>the quickness,</v>

1444
00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:03.650
<v Speaker 3>Irish drunks on coke.</v>

1445
00:42:03.651 --> 00:42:04.484
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

1446
00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:07.880
<v Speaker 3>I knew a lot of those Italian woods as well.</v>

1447
00:42:07.881 --> 00:42:08.810
<v Speaker 3>Don't want to discriminate.</v>

1448
00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:13.930
<v Speaker 3>The people that I liked was the kind of philosophical tradition that was there.</v>

1449
00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:15.800
<v Speaker 3>I loved Emerson friends,</v>

1450
00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:16.280
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1451
00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:18.890
<v Speaker 3>And call her and uh,</v>

1452
00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:23.350
<v Speaker 3>and William James there at Harvard and then later Tim leary and,</v>

1453
00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:25.030
<v Speaker 3>and Ron doss guys.</v>

1454
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:30.130
<v Speaker 3>And so there was a tradition of a kind of altered states and they,</v>

1455
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:33.740
<v Speaker 3>they did a lot of the experimentation,</v>

1456
00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:35.690
<v Speaker 3>the original experiments with uh,</v>

1457
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1458
00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:39.740
<v Speaker 3>Walder Panky when he did the Good Friday experiment.</v>

1459
00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:40.161
<v Speaker 3>Waits.</v>

1460
00:42:40.161 --> 00:42:42.710
<v Speaker 3>Amazing city as far as education goes.</v>

1461
00:42:42.711 --> 00:42:46.220
<v Speaker 3>I think that has more colleges per capita than anywhere else in the world or in</v>

1462
00:42:46.221 --> 00:42:47.054
<v Speaker 3>the country rather.</v>

1463
00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:48.013
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1464
00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:51.260
<v Speaker 3>I also think you think about it like Harvard and Mit,</v>

1465
00:42:51.261 --> 00:42:52.630
<v Speaker 3>both in the same city that,</v>

1466
00:42:52.631 --> 00:42:53.061
<v Speaker 3>what are those?</v>

1467
00:42:53.061 --> 00:42:53.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's Cambridge,</v>

1468
00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:55.520
<v Speaker 3>but what are the odds of that?</v>

1469
00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.020
<v Speaker 3>Cambridge is basically Boston.</v>

1470
00:42:57.590 --> 00:42:58.670
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing.</v>

1471
00:42:58.970 --> 00:42:59.661
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1472
00:42:59.661 --> 00:43:00.230
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1473
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:02.270
<v Speaker 3>what a crazy town for smart people.</v>

1474
00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:03.253
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

1475
00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:03.891
<v Speaker 3>you're so smart.</v>

1476
00:43:03.891 --> 00:43:04.461
<v Speaker 3>Why would they be there?</v>

1477
00:43:04.461 --> 00:43:05.294
<v Speaker 3>It's so cold.</v>

1478
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:07.303
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1479
00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:07.690
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1480
00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:07.970

00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:09.710

1483
00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:11.181
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1484
00:43:11.181 --> 00:43:11.681
<v Speaker 3>That makes it,</v>

1485
00:43:11.681 --> 00:43:12.501
<v Speaker 3>makes you a hard worker,</v>

1486
00:43:12.501 --> 00:43:13.370
<v Speaker 3>that's for damn sure.</v>

1487
00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:14.690
<v Speaker 3>Grow up with a work ethic.</v>

1488
00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:15.500
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1489
00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:16.041
<v Speaker 3>I grew up,</v>

1490
00:43:16.041 --> 00:43:18.350
<v Speaker 3>I learned how to work hard because every around me worked hard.</v>

1491
00:43:18.351 --> 00:43:19.100
<v Speaker 3>Look at you.</v>

1492
00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:20.960
<v Speaker 3>They got lucky now you,</v>

1493
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:22.100
<v Speaker 3>well for sure.</v>

1494
00:43:22.101 --> 00:43:22.611
<v Speaker 3>Trust me,</v>

1495
00:43:22.611 --> 00:43:23.690
<v Speaker 3>it was a lot of luck involved.</v>

1496
00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:26.030
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1497
00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:28.130
<v Speaker 3>throwing up with people in Boston.</v>

1498
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:28.971
<v Speaker 3>It really,</v>

1499
00:43:28.971 --> 00:43:31.160
<v Speaker 3>definitely when that fucking winter comes,</v>

1500
00:43:31.161 --> 00:43:31.550
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1501
00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:32.660
<v Speaker 3>you gotta be prepared.</v>

1502
00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:35.090
<v Speaker 3>I'd love California,</v>

1503
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:36.530
<v Speaker 3>but there's something about it.</v>

1504
00:43:36.531 --> 00:43:38.330
<v Speaker 3>Like I even look at my kids and I'm like,</v>

1505
00:43:38.331 --> 00:43:41.870
<v Speaker 3>you know when to do you good to freeze your ass off every now and then.</v>

1506
00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:46.610
<v Speaker 3>Good to realize that you got to get in the house because it's cold outside.</v>

1507
00:43:46.611 --> 00:43:46.911
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1508
00:43:46.911 --> 00:43:48.410
<v Speaker 3>to know that that shit's out there.</v>

1509
00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:53.000
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a humility that comes with having to deal with weather and</v>

1510
00:43:53.001 --> 00:43:54.710
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately as we're saying this podcast,</v>

1511
00:43:54.711 --> 00:43:59.210
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of people died in Oklahoma with a horrible tornado.</v>

1512
00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:00.273
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

1513
00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:05.030
<v Speaker 3>we had to twisters acknowledge I'll sound that is and how fucking crazy it is</v>

1514
00:44:05.031 --> 00:44:10.031
<v Speaker 3>that there's a part of the world where the sky becomes an angry machine monster,</v>

1515
00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:11.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1516
00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:16.430
<v Speaker 3>spinning wind that picks up Semitrailers and sends him flying through the air.</v>

1517
00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:18.950
<v Speaker 3>That is how horrific cows.</v>

1518
00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:21.670
<v Speaker 3>What's that move out of Oklahoma?</v>

1519
00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:22.120
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1520
00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.330
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them can't man.</v>

1521
00:44:23.331 --> 00:44:24.680
<v Speaker 3>A lot of this is the problem.</v>

1522
00:44:24.681 --> 00:44:28.130
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people are poor and they've been there for years and the family's</v>

1523
00:44:28.131 --> 00:44:28.550
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1524
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:31.160
<v Speaker 3>It's not that easy to just kind of pack up your shit.</v>

1525
00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:31.951
<v Speaker 3>Go to Michigan.</v>

1526
00:44:31.951 --> 00:44:32.370
<v Speaker 3>It's</v>

1527
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:36.180
<v Speaker 6>cheaper that Ms. Definitely more bullets though.</v>

1528
00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:36.870
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1529
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:39.240
<v Speaker 6>maybe around Detroit apparently.</v>

1530
00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:40.110
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1531
00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:42.570
<v Speaker 6>Detroit is like the worst place in the world to be a book.</v>

1532
00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:48.300
<v Speaker 6>They say that Detroit is a 47% illiteracy rate in Detroit.</v>

1533
00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:50.160
<v Speaker 6>Did you make that up?</v>

1534
00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:50.701
<v Speaker 6>I just made it up.</v>

1535
00:44:50.701 --> 00:44:51.534
<v Speaker 6>That's hilarious.</v>

1536
00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:53.850
<v Speaker 6>It's crazy.</v>

1537
00:44:53.851 --> 00:44:56.790
<v Speaker 6>If you really stop and think about it at 47% illiteracy rate,</v>

1538
00:44:56.791 --> 00:44:57.660
<v Speaker 6>like what is going on?</v>

1539
00:44:57.661 --> 00:45:00.080
<v Speaker 6>Like who is w no one's paying attention to anybody like,</v>

1540
00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:01.800
<v Speaker 6>like the cover.</v>

1541
00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:06.060
<v Speaker 6>The government should absolutely focus on situations like that.</v>

1542
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:09.990
<v Speaker 6>The idea that we shouldn't intervene in places where it's gotten so out of hand</v>

1543
00:45:09.991 --> 00:45:13.650
<v Speaker 6>that half the people can't read like that should be thought of as an epidemic</v>

1544
00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:16.860
<v Speaker 6>because all of those people that can't read or going to give birth to children</v>

1545
00:45:16.861 --> 00:45:18.060
<v Speaker 6>that probably can't read either.</v>

1546
00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:22.800
<v Speaker 6>And you have thousands if not millions of people who can't read and then they're</v>

1547
00:45:22.801 --> 00:45:24.990
<v Speaker 6>going to enter into the world unprepared,</v>

1548
00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:26.430
<v Speaker 6>unprepared to communicate,</v>

1549
00:45:26.431 --> 00:45:27.480
<v Speaker 6>to exchange information,</v>

1550
00:45:27.481 --> 00:45:29.190
<v Speaker 6>to be able to find things out for themselves.</v>

1551
00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:32.160
<v Speaker 6>I have to take a bunch of people's words for things he can't read things.</v>

1552
00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:34.590
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's so much involved in being illiterate.</v>

1553
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:38.460
<v Speaker 6>The fact that there's like millions of potential crazy people that are going to</v>

1554
00:45:38.461 --> 00:45:43.461
<v Speaker 6>go through life completely illiterate in 2013 and no one's up in arms about</v>

1555
00:45:44.101 --> 00:45:44.730
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

1556
00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:46.020
<v Speaker 6>It's really kind of shocking.</v>

1557
00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:47.340
<v Speaker 6>It is.</v>

1558
00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:48.780
<v Speaker 6>And at uh,</v>

1559
00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:49.643
<v Speaker 6>something,</v>

1560
00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:50.700
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1561
00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:54.210
<v Speaker 6>each one of us has to focus on in whatever way we can.</v>

1562
00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:55.120
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1563
00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:57.120
<v Speaker 6>It's hard to make a person,</v>

1564
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:59.100
<v Speaker 6>it's hard to raise a human being.</v>

1565
00:45:59.101 --> 00:46:00.270
<v Speaker 6>It's not an easy thing.</v>

1566
00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:04.680
<v Speaker 6>And when we're looking at human beings that are being raised in like really</v>

1567
00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:06.030
<v Speaker 6>terrible conditions,</v>

1568
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:11.390
<v Speaker 6>and it should be like one of the first things like the whole world concentrates</v>

1569
00:46:11.491 --> 00:46:13.410
<v Speaker 6>on before you concentrate on,</v>

1570
00:46:13.411 --> 00:46:14.550
<v Speaker 6>I mean it sounds so hippy,</v>

1571
00:46:14.551 --> 00:46:17.970
<v Speaker 6>but it seems like if you really want to have a happy life,</v>

1572
00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:20.550
<v Speaker 6>you've got to be doing more good than you are harm.</v>

1573
00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:22.200
<v Speaker 6>And there's,</v>

1574
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:25.060
<v Speaker 6>there's gotta be a way to do that first.</v>

1575
00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:26.820
<v Speaker 6>Does gotta be a way to say,</v>

1576
00:46:26.821 --> 00:46:27.121
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

1577
00:46:27.121 --> 00:46:29.640
<v Speaker 6>there's x amount of people in the world that are starving,</v>

1578
00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:34.710
<v Speaker 6>let's all globally chip in to try to stop that from happening so that these</v>

1579
00:46:34.711 --> 00:46:38.400
<v Speaker 6>starving people don't have starving children who never get a chance to get some</v>

1580
00:46:38.401 --> 00:46:40.830
<v Speaker 6>momentum in life and be comfortable and happy.</v>

1581
00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:41.611
<v Speaker 6>It never comes.</v>

1582
00:46:41.611 --> 00:46:44.430
<v Speaker 6>It never comes to just give them a chance.</v>

1583
00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:44.541
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

1584
00:46:44.541 --> 00:46:47.190
<v Speaker 6>wouldn't it be like the most important thing you could ever do it like as a,</v>

1585
00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:52.220
<v Speaker 6>as a race to stop the worst conditions to stop the worst conditions with Sam?</v>

1586
00:46:53.851 --> 00:46:55.410
<v Speaker 6>Kinison had the best bit about that.</v>

1587
00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:56.040
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1588
00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:56.880
<v Speaker 6>it was so cruel,</v>

1589
00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:58.350
<v Speaker 6>but it was so amazing what he's saying.</v>

1590
00:46:58.410 --> 00:47:00.630
<v Speaker 6>He's talking about Ethiopian children have,</v>

1591
00:47:00.631 --> 00:47:01.740
<v Speaker 6>they have those commercials.</v>

1592
00:47:01.741 --> 00:47:02.341
<v Speaker 6>He's always like,</v>

1593
00:47:02.341 --> 00:47:03.870
<v Speaker 6>you should just fix yourself some dinner.</v>

1594
00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:07.620
<v Speaker 6>He's sitting there and it's commercial and it's like blue cheese help him.</v>

1595
00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:08.461
<v Speaker 6>Why don't you send it?</v>

1596
00:47:08.461 --> 00:47:08.850
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>

1597
00:47:08.850 --> 00:47:09.121
<v Speaker 6>cause like,</v>

1598
00:47:09.121 --> 00:47:10.080
<v Speaker 6>why don't you help him?</v>

1599
00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:11.580
<v Speaker 6>You're only five feet away.</v>

1600
00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:13.500
<v Speaker 6>He's the guy behind the camera.</v>

1601
00:47:13.501 --> 00:47:14.650
<v Speaker 6>We've got a Snicker's bar going.</v>

1602
00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:15.151
<v Speaker 6>Not now.</v>

1603

1651
00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:17.380
<v Speaker 1>comedian who had a psychedelic ideas that he was putting forth.</v>

1655
00:48:19.091 --> 00:48:20.950
<v Speaker 1>They were just incredibly profound,</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1657

1658
00:48:23.971 --> 00:48:25.360
<v Speaker 1>It was what was so weird about it.</v>

1664
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.361
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1665
00:48:31.361 --> 00:48:36.361
<v Speaker 5>mine bombs into your psyche so that they kind of melted and,</v>

1666
00:48:38.081 --> 00:48:38.440
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1667

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

1670
00:48:40.461 --> 00:48:45.070
<v Speaker 5>he knew how to kind of stay in your consciousness with,</v>

1671
00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:45.943
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1672
00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:46.840
<v Speaker 5>a new,</v>

1673
00:48:46.841 --> 00:48:47.674
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1674
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:48.190
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1675
00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:49.023
<v Speaker 5>perception</v>

1676
00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:51.300
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of his stuff's still holds up.</v>

1677
00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:52.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1678
00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:52.510
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

1679
00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:53.220
<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>

1680
00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:54.660
<v Speaker 1>especially if you haven't heard it before,</v>

1681
00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:59.370
<v Speaker 1>which I still holds up because what he was saying about the Bush administration,</v>

1682
00:48:59.371 --> 00:49:00.900
<v Speaker 1>the first Bush administration,</v>

1683
00:49:00.901 --> 00:49:01.734
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1684
00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:02.131
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1685
00:49:02.131 --> 00:49:02.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1686
00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:06.750
<v Speaker 1>that was when he was railing against the machine.</v>

1687
00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:10.170
<v Speaker 1>It's just like you could just take it and substitute the words and it works.</v>

1688
00:49:10.171 --> 00:49:11.004
<v Speaker 1>Today.</v>

1689
00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:14.490
<v Speaker 1>It worked with George W it works with Obama.</v>

1690
00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:14.761
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1691
00:49:14.761 --> 00:49:15.121
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

1692
00:49:15.121 --> 00:49:15.900
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

1693
00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:16.733
<v Speaker 1>the material works.</v>

1694
00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:18.540
<v Speaker 1>Just substitute this guy for that guy.</v>

1695
00:49:18.541 --> 00:49:19.130
<v Speaker 1>And he was,</v>

1696
00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:20.040
<v Speaker 1>it's still relevant.</v>

1697
00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:25.200
<v Speaker 1>And so he gave birth to like a whole completely different style comedian like</v>

1698
00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:25.531
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1699
00:49:25.531 --> 00:49:27.930
<v Speaker 1>The style of comedian that came after him was like,</v>

1700
00:49:27.931 --> 00:49:29.700
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to like educate you,</v>

1701
00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:31.950
<v Speaker 1>which is really weird because some of them were idiots.</v>

1702
00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:32.611
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1703
00:49:32.611 --> 00:49:32.731
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1704

<v Speaker 1>there was a on the wall of,</v>

1705
00:49:34.141 --> 00:49:34.710

00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:42.000
<v Speaker 1>There's a big sign that says,</v>

1711
00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:44.070
<v Speaker 1>don't stop trying to be Hicks.</v>

1726
00:49:59.731 --> 00:50:02.820
<v Speaker 1>A particle guys had a funny thing to say about,</v>

<v Speaker 1>have the seek to understand it now.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

1738
00:50:21.181 --> 00:50:22.620
<v Speaker 1>I would've never thought that far ahead.</v>

1749
00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:43.603
<v Speaker 5>Uh Huh.</v>

1750
00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:44.050
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1751
00:50:44.050 --> 00:50:46.530
<v Speaker 3>made a lot of people were of psychedelics too.</v>

1752
00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:50.400
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of people that did not know anything about like heroic doses or</v>

1753
00:50:50.401 --> 00:50:51.360
<v Speaker 3>any of that shit.</v>

1754
00:50:51.690 --> 00:50:54.810
<v Speaker 3>Like Hicks was like the first stand up comedian to ever talk about things that</v>

1755
00:50:54.811 --> 00:50:55.540
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

1756
00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:57.060
<v Speaker 3>The other ones that would talk about mushrooms,</v>

1757
00:50:57.061 --> 00:50:57.641
<v Speaker 3>it would be like,</v>

1758
00:50:57.641 --> 00:50:57.730
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1759
00:50:57.730 --> 00:50:57.851
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1760
00:50:57.851 --> 00:50:59.670
<v Speaker 3>we did most rooms and you know,</v>

1761
00:50:59.671 --> 00:51:02.280
<v Speaker 3>we got old goofy and Bobby thought he was a horse.</v>

1762
00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:03.780
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1763
00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:05.070
<v Speaker 3>that's usually the story.</v>

1764
00:51:05.071 --> 00:51:06.000
<v Speaker 3>It was never like,</v>

1765
00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:08.850
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't like what Hicks was describing.</v>

1766
00:51:08.851 --> 00:51:09.151
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

1767
00:51:09.151 --> 00:51:10.200
<v Speaker 3>what is this guy saying?</v>

1768
00:51:10.201 --> 00:51:12.440
<v Speaker 3>Because how come it's different than everybody else that takes mushrooms?</v>

1769
00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:15.390
<v Speaker 3>And I think just,</v>

1770
00:51:15.391 --> 00:51:17.640
<v Speaker 3>it was so interesting and fascinating when he would talk about it,</v>

1771
00:51:17.641 --> 00:51:20.460
<v Speaker 3>that it just led a lot of people to explore that.</v>

1772
00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:22.860
<v Speaker 5>I think he was,</v>

1773
00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:23.090
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1774
00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:23.870
<v Speaker 5>another,</v>

1775
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:24.150
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1776
00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:29.150
<v Speaker 5>kind of apostle and a a and a kind of a nightclub setting.</v>

1777
00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:29.741
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1778
00:51:29.741 --> 00:51:29.991
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1779
00:51:29.991 --> 00:51:31.330
<v Speaker 3>in digitally still is,</v>

1780
00:51:31.331 --> 00:51:31.601
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1781
00:51:31.601 --> 00:51:32.400
<v Speaker 3>we can still hear it</v>

1782
00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:33.630
<v Speaker 5>words exactly.</v>

1783
00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:38.780
<v Speaker 5>Because we resonate with the authenticity that and the rawness that he</v>

1784
00:51:39.841 --> 00:51:40.650
<v Speaker 5>projected.</v>

1785
00:51:40.650 --> 00:51:42.570
<v Speaker 5>And with a Psychedelic,</v>

1786
00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:43.470
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1787
00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:48.300
<v Speaker 5>perspective that allowed him a kind of brutal honesty.</v>

1788
00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:48.710
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1789
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:49.081
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1790
00:51:49.081 --> 00:51:49.914
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1791
00:51:49.950 --> 00:51:50.783
<v Speaker 5>and yet,</v>

1792
00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:51.883
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1793
00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:56.730
<v Speaker 5>there was something remarkably magnetic because he,</v>

1794
00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:58.830
<v Speaker 5>he was like a laser about the truth.</v>

1795
00:51:58.831 --> 00:51:59.664
<v Speaker 5>It seemed.</v>

1796
00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:00.900
<v Speaker 5>That was what he wanted,</v>

1797
00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:01.620
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1798
00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:04.200
<v Speaker 5>to be about even at the,</v>

1799
00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:05.513
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1800
00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:06.393
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1801
00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:08.100
<v Speaker 5>and to,</v>

1802
00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:09.720
<v Speaker 5>to reveal a,</v>

1803
00:52:09.721 --> 00:52:10.554
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1804
00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:16.200
<v Speaker 5>I kind of underlying darkness was something that he was an expert.</v>

1805
00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:19.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1806
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.641
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1807
00:52:19.641 --> 00:52:20.474
<v Speaker 3>He really was.</v>

1808
00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:21.433
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1809
00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:22.040
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1810
00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:22.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1811
00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:24.430
<v Speaker 3>he had a lot of references that he would do,</v>

1812
00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:27.110
<v Speaker 3>use it as material that would make you seek out of the shit,</v>

1813
00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:29.930
<v Speaker 3>like with Terence Mckenna would call heroic dose,</v>

1814
00:52:29.931 --> 00:52:30.201
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1815
00:52:30.201 --> 00:52:30.651
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

1816
00:52:30.651 --> 00:52:31.670
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck is Terence Mckenna?</v>

1817
00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:33.020
<v Speaker 3>And then I started reading about trends,</v>

1818
00:52:33.021 --> 00:52:33.530
<v Speaker 3>but can I go,</v>

1819
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:34.131
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

1820
00:52:34.131 --> 00:52:34.970
<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>

1821
00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:36.500
<v Speaker 3>holy shit,</v>

1822
00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:37.790
<v Speaker 3>I serve food of the gods.</v>

1823
00:52:37.791 --> 00:52:38.210
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1824
00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:39.010
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>

1825
00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:39.230
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1826
00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:40.063
<v Speaker 3>where's this Guy Ben?</v>

1827
00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:40.720
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1828
00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:43.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean Hicks exposes people or did expose.</v>

1829
00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:43.651
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1830
00:52:43.651 --> 00:52:44.360
<v Speaker 3>he did.</v>

1831
00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:46.160
<v Speaker 3>And then once he got into the mechanic door,</v>

1832
00:52:46.161 --> 00:52:47.630
<v Speaker 3>then you were off to the races.</v>

1833
00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:47.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1834
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:50.840
<v Speaker 3>Once you start listening to those Mckenna mp3s that are available online,</v>

1835
00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:54.230
<v Speaker 3>you want to talk about something that will just crack your consciousness.</v>

1836
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.581
<v Speaker 3>Those,</v>

1837
00:52:55.581 --> 00:52:55.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1838
00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:57.550
<v Speaker 3>Mckenna mp3s of that,</v>

1839
00:52:57.570 --> 00:52:58.940
<v Speaker 3>some of those lectures that he gave,</v>

1840
00:52:58.941 --> 00:53:00.570
<v Speaker 3>he just what he thought.</v>

1841
00:53:00.571 --> 00:53:00.661
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

1842
00:53:00.661 --> 00:53:02.690
<v Speaker 3>I had an a very strange way of thinking.</v>

1843
00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:04.040
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1844
00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:05.930
<v Speaker 5>I used to think of him as the,</v>

1845
00:53:05.931 --> 00:53:06.620
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1846

1848
00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:11.151
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1849
00:53:11.151 --> 00:53:11.510
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1850
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:14.000
<v Speaker 5>he was kind of plugged in to that,</v>

1851
00:53:14.001 --> 00:53:15.570
<v Speaker 5>but he and his brother both,</v>

1852
00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:15.980
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1879
00:53:53.610 --> 00:53:54.050
<v Speaker 3>he did.</v>

1880
00:53:54.050 --> 00:53:54.180
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1881
00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:56.670
<v Speaker 3>he was great with the brothers of the screaming of best.</v>

1882
00:53:56.671 --> 00:53:56.851
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1883
00:53:56.851 --> 00:53:57.270
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1884
00:53:57.270 --> 00:53:58.860
<v Speaker 3>we talked about is awesome.</v>

1885
00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:02.930
<v Speaker 3>We just talked about psychedelics and we talked very specifically about the,</v>

1886
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:07.830
<v Speaker 3>the actual science behind the possibility of psychedelics creating language and</v>

1887
00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:10.470
<v Speaker 3>especially as particularly psilocybin,</v>

1888
00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:13.290
<v Speaker 3>and he was explaining how,</v>

1889
00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:13.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1890
00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:17.750
<v Speaker 3>it would make sense that language was created through the use of,</v>

1891
00:54:17.751 --> 00:54:21.600
<v Speaker 3>of silicide been by virtue of the effect of silicide when hasn't a very</v>

1892
00:54:21.601 --> 00:54:23.970
<v Speaker 3>scientific way that I can't recreate and traps.</v>

1893
00:54:24.010 --> 00:54:24.301
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1894
00:54:24.301 --> 00:54:24.810
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

1895
00:54:24.810 --> 00:54:25.441
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1896
00:54:25.441 --> 00:54:27.300
<v Speaker 3>I never even heard anybody say it that way before,</v>

1897
00:54:27.301 --> 00:54:28.650
<v Speaker 3>but that completely makes sense.</v>

1898
00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:32.400
<v Speaker 3>Obviously one theory and I don't understand really what he's saying.</v>

1899
00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:33.450
<v Speaker 3>It just sounds awesome.</v>

1900
00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:33.901
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1901
00:54:33.901 --> 00:54:36.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't know whether or not there's some science to it.</v>

1902
00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:37.740
<v Speaker 3>Other people might disagree with it.</v>

1903
00:54:37.741 --> 00:54:42.741
<v Speaker 3>Let's say that it's a common place for people to want to express themselves</v>

1904
00:54:43.201 --> 00:54:47.220
<v Speaker 3>creatively in the wake of a psychedelic experience.</v>

1905
00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:47.431
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1906
00:54:47.431 --> 00:54:48.510
<v Speaker 3>I was going to ask you though,</v>

1907
00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:51.480
<v Speaker 3>why do you think that is that people would dismiss that?</v>

1908
00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:56.310
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think it is that people would ridicule that?</v>

1909
00:54:56.780 --> 00:55:00.300
<v Speaker 3>Like someone saying that you actually learned something from a psychedelic</v>

1910
00:55:00.301 --> 00:55:00.721
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

1911
00:55:00.721 --> 00:55:05.010
<v Speaker 3>You say that to the average person and then they'll look at you with ridicule,</v>

1912
00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:05.640
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1913
00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:05.930
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

1914
00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:06.691
<v Speaker 3>How did that happen,</v>

1915
00:55:06.691 --> 00:55:07.524
<v Speaker 3>do you think?</v>

1916
00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:08.873

1924

00:55:28.141 --> 00:55:30.630

<v Speaker 5>why do people who alter their consciousness or who speak of it inspire,</v>

1933
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:39.530
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1934

00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:43.440
<v Speaker 5>hysteria in people that don't take them,</v>

00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:45.093
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1938
00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:48.140
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

1939
00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:49.553
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>

1940
00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:50.650
<v Speaker 3>that's a great,</v>

1941
00:55:50.650 --> 00:55:51.483
<v Speaker 3>great line.</v>

00:55:52.750 --> 00:55:53.051
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1944
00:55:53.051 --> 00:55:53.440
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1945
00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:55.330
<v Speaker 3>I think that for a lot of folks,</v>

1946
00:55:55.331 --> 00:55:55.661
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1947
00:55:55.661 --> 00:55:59.350
<v Speaker 3>first of all the equate drugs with bad,</v>

1948
00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:00.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1949
00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:01.360
<v Speaker 3>they think of you drugs.</v>

1950
00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:03.550
<v Speaker 3>The problem is meth is a drug too.</v>

1951
00:56:04.030 --> 00:56:08.830
<v Speaker 3>And meth wrecks lives to put cocaine fucks people up.</v>

1952
00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:09.820
<v Speaker 3>But then there's pot,</v>

1953
00:56:09.821 --> 00:56:10.510
<v Speaker 3>which doesn't,</v>

1954
00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:11.410
<v Speaker 3>and then there's mushrooms,</v>

1955
00:56:11.411 --> 00:56:12.190
<v Speaker 3>which does,</v>

1956
00:56:12.190 --> 00:56:12.820
<v Speaker 3>these are,</v>

1957
00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:13.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1958
00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:14.260
<v Speaker 3>they're all drugs though.</v>

1959
00:56:14.290 --> 00:56:14.621
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1960
00:56:14.621 --> 00:56:15.050
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

1961
00:56:15.050 --> 00:56:15.520
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>

1962
00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:15.881
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1963
00:56:15.881 --> 00:56:18.430
<v Speaker 3>you could look at some as a food as it,</v>

1964
00:56:18.490 --> 00:56:23.490
<v Speaker 3>and it's better maybe to classify some as a sacrament that have been that</v>

1965
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:24.770
<v Speaker 5>sacrament,</v>

1966
00:56:24.770 --> 00:56:25.360
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1967
00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:28.120
<v Speaker 5>for longer than they were a quote drug.</v>

1968
00:56:28.590 --> 00:56:29.260
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1969
00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:32.920
<v Speaker 5>they were a way to that people connected with the,</v>

1970
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.640
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1971
00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:35.080
<v Speaker 5>with the higher dimensions.</v>

1972
00:56:35.590 --> 00:56:37.210
<v Speaker 1>What does the term entheogens,</v>

1973
00:56:37.211 --> 00:56:38.600
<v Speaker 1>what is the actual,</v>

1974
00:56:38.601 --> 00:56:38.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1975
00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:39.693
<v Speaker 1>translation</v>

1976
00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:41.580
<v Speaker 5>n Theo,</v>

1977
00:56:41.850 --> 00:56:42.820

00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:44.660
<v Speaker 5>God or the divine.</v>

1979
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:47.780
<v Speaker 5>And Anthea would be the divine within</v>

1980
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:52.220
<v Speaker 1>bunch of dudes that are really do she just decided the name their son Theo after</v>

1981
00:56:52.221 --> 00:56:53.054
<v Speaker 1>hearing that</v>

1982
00:56:54.570 --> 00:56:55.231
<v Speaker 7>my boy,</v>

1983
00:56:55.231 --> 00:56:56.064
<v Speaker 7>the God,</v>

1984
00:56:56.690 --> 00:56:59.070
<v Speaker 7>God Deo faulting.</v>

1985
00:56:59.080 --> 00:56:59.913
<v Speaker 7>Awesome.</v>

1986
00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:02.050
<v Speaker 5>So that's what entheogenic means.</v>

1987
00:57:02.290 --> 00:57:02.830
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1988
00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:03.880
<v Speaker 5>So it's from the God.</v>

1989
00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:04.780
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1990
00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:05.613
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1991
00:57:05.710 --> 00:57:06.340
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>

1992
00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:09.000
<v Speaker 5>a way to discover or a,</v>

1993
00:57:09.110 --> 00:57:09.943
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1994
00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:15.580
<v Speaker 5>a substance that allows you to discover the God within or the divine within it,</v>

1995
00:57:15.991 --> 00:57:16.540
<v Speaker 5>within.</v>

1996
00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:18.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't blame people that are,</v>

1997
00:57:18.671 --> 00:57:19.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1998
00:57:19.050 --> 00:57:20.210
<v Speaker 1>that discriminated against.</v>

1999
00:57:20.211 --> 00:57:22.990
<v Speaker 1>So I did dogs if they haven't had psychedelics.</v>

2000
00:57:23.350 --> 00:57:24.970
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just an ignorance thing.</v>

2001
00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:27.140
<v Speaker 1>I think the people have a lot of,</v>

2002
00:57:27.141 --> 00:57:27.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2003
00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:32.310
<v Speaker 1>bad ideas and then don't necessarily think it's their responsibility to be right</v>

2004
00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:34.990
<v Speaker 1>about something that they haven't experienced themselves.</v>

2005
00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:35.921
<v Speaker 1>And that is,</v>

2006
00:57:35.921 --> 00:57:36.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2007
00:57:36.251 --> 00:57:36.881
<v Speaker 1>in society,</v>

2008
00:57:36.881 --> 00:57:37.750
<v Speaker 1>it sort of is,</v>

2009
00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:39.510
<v Speaker 1>it's looked down upon,</v>

2010
00:57:39.511 --> 00:57:41.850
<v Speaker 1>it's looked down upon to alter your consciousness like that,</v>

2011
00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:42.580
<v Speaker 1>that if you do it,</v>

2012
00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:44.470
<v Speaker 1>you're probably looking to escape reality.</v>

2013
00:57:44.471 --> 00:57:46.120
<v Speaker 1>That's like the standard take on it.</v>

2014
00:57:46.410 --> 00:57:50.660
<v Speaker 5>Yet many of these people would consider themselves to be religious people.</v>

2015
00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:51.500
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

2016
00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:52.333
<v Speaker 5>A lot of them,</v>

2017
00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:57.480
<v Speaker 5>if you look at the foundations of all world religions as we've just gone through</v>

2018
00:57:57.831 --> 00:57:58.000
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

2019
00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:58.240
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2020
00:57:58.240 --> 00:57:58.730
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2021
00:57:58.730 --> 00:58:02.600
<v Speaker 5>we can see that they were based on this visionary mystical experience,</v>

2022
00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:06.350
<v Speaker 5>which is what we're saying is a value for everyone.</v>

2023
00:58:06.351 --> 00:58:06.540
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2024
00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:07.051
<v Speaker 1>But Alex,</v>

2025
00:58:07.051 --> 00:58:08.370
<v Speaker 1>that was thousands of years ago.</v>

2026
00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:10.020
<v Speaker 1>They don't want it anymore.</v>

2027
00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:10.680
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2028
00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:11.880
<v Speaker 1>If Jesus came around today,</v>

2029
00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:13.260
<v Speaker 1>no one would believe him.</v>

2030
00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:16.880
<v Speaker 1>There was some dude that was claiming that he was the son of God.</v>

2031
00:58:16.890 --> 00:58:18.300
<v Speaker 1>You would give wisdom to everybody.</v>

2032
00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:20.070
<v Speaker 1>They'd probably put them in Guantanamo Bay.</v>

2033
00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:22.530
<v Speaker 1>There's no way they would let that guy just run around running shit.</v>

2034
00:58:23.050 --> 00:58:23.750
<v Speaker 7>A lot of,</v>

2035
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:24.220
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2036
00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:24.941
<v Speaker 7>people,</v>

2037
00:58:24.941 --> 00:58:25.270
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2038
00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:26.103
<v Speaker 7>God,</v>

2039
00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:26.620
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2040
00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:28.800
<v Speaker 7>inspired people are on the loose,</v>

2041
00:58:28.801 --> 00:58:29.634
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2042
00:58:29.850 --> 00:58:31.300
<v Speaker 7>they're just like spores.</v>

2043
00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:31.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2044
00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:32.551
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

2045
00:58:32.551 --> 00:58:33.160
<v Speaker 1>But there's,</v>

2046
00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:34.830
<v Speaker 1>but the idea of the one,</v>

2047
00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:36.320
<v Speaker 1>a messiah coming back,</v>

2048
00:58:36.330 --> 00:58:39.840
<v Speaker 1>a Magical Messiah with power to branch out from the dead.</v>

2049
00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:40.900
<v Speaker 5>Did I,</v>

2050
00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:45.040
<v Speaker 5>did I already say my theory about the second coming?</v>

2051
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:46.110
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2052
00:58:46.110 --> 00:58:46.500
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2056

2057
00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:52.420
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

2058

<v Speaker 5>South America.</v>

<v Speaker 5>A lot of IOWASCA churches all over the world are,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I call it the green Jesus,</v>

2102
00:59:55.310 --> 00:59:55.760
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2103
00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:56.580
<v Speaker 5>because,</v>

2104
00:59:56.580 --> 00:59:58.130
<v Speaker 5>and Grain Mary really,</v>

2105

<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2106
00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:00.410
<v Speaker 5>because it's,</v>

2107
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:01.070
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2108
01:00:01.070 --> 01:00:06.070
<v Speaker 5>revealing the divinity of nature and there's nothing more important right now.</v>

2109
01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:08.090
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2110
01:00:08.090 --> 01:00:13.090
<v Speaker 5>then recognizing the divinity and the sacredness of nature and saving the life</v>

2111
01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:17.330
<v Speaker 5>web in whatever ways we can,</v>

2112
01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:18.560
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2113
01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:23.360
<v Speaker 5>somehow turning our ship around from a self destructive species.</v>

2114
01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:24.171
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2115
01:00:24.171 --> 01:00:26.360
<v Speaker 5>this is the tight place where heading into</v>

2116
01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:27.501
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>

2117
01:00:27.501 --> 01:00:28.640
<v Speaker 3>but it isn't always been linked.</v>

2118
01:00:28.641 --> 01:00:28.881
<v Speaker 3>US,</v>

2119
01:00:28.881 --> 01:00:31.340
<v Speaker 3>isn't this the Yin and the Yang that makes people human?</v>

2120
01:00:31.790 --> 01:00:33.320
<v Speaker 3>Perhaps the pushing the pole.</v>

2121
01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:37.140
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes we need to rally against an impending doom pod.</v>

2122
01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:37.993
<v Speaker 3>I know it's,</v>

2123
01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:39.950
<v Speaker 3>it's a part of being a person.</v>

2124
01:00:39.951 --> 01:00:40.790
<v Speaker 3>We're goofy.</v>

2125
01:00:40.850 --> 01:00:45.850
<v Speaker 3>We don't want to cram for tests where we're adolescent species and wildly</v>

2126
01:00:46.041 --> 01:00:46.880
<v Speaker 3>destructive.</v>

2127
01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:47.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2128
01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:48.031
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2129
01:00:48.031 --> 01:00:51.180
<v Speaker 5>we only exist through the grace of the,</v>

2130
01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:52.170
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2131
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:52.570
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2132
01:00:52.570 --> 01:00:56.490
<v Speaker 5>the kinds of spirits that are tolerant because we're so creative.</v>

2133
01:00:56.550 --> 01:00:57.570
<v Speaker 5>I think that,</v>

2134
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:59.640
<v Speaker 3>and they hope that we will,</v>

2135
01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:00.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2136
01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:00.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2137
01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:03.930
<v Speaker 3>work on this together with the intelligence that's,</v>

2138
01:01:04.410 --> 01:01:05.910
<v Speaker 3>that's seeding today.</v>

2139
01:01:06.210 --> 01:01:10.440
<v Speaker 3>And we've also been born in a super lucky spot as far as the history of</v>

2140
01:01:10.441 --> 01:01:11.130
<v Speaker 3>humanity.</v>

2141
01:01:11.130 --> 01:01:13.620
<v Speaker 3>We didn't have to go through the people trying to make it across the,</v>

2142
01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:17.370
<v Speaker 3>the West with wagon trains and we didn't have to go through any of that.</v>

2143
01:01:17.650 --> 01:01:19.230
<v Speaker 3>We were lucky we have internet.</v>

2144
01:01:19.830 --> 01:01:24.830
<v Speaker 3>Perhaps we'll be loading in some astral dimension and they,</v>

2145
01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:26.093
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2146
01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:30.090
<v Speaker 3>in the next lifetime that's possible to do you,</v>

2147
01:01:30.091 --> 01:01:31.080
<v Speaker 3>do you have,</v>

2148
01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:33.570
<v Speaker 3>do you feel you have a responsibility from,</v>

2149
01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:35.103
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2150
01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:35.671
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

2151
01:01:35.671 --> 01:01:35.941
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

2152
01:01:35.941 --> 01:01:37.200
<v Speaker 3>the fact that you have this,</v>

2153
01:01:37.201 --> 01:01:37.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2154
01:01:37.570 --> 01:01:37.930
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2155
01:01:37.930 --> 01:01:41.790
<v Speaker 3>this voice and you are looked at as this sort of psychedelic visionary guy.</v>

2156
01:01:42.210 --> 01:01:46.470
<v Speaker 3>Do you feel like you have a responsibility to try to get information out?</v>

2157
01:01:46.530 --> 01:01:47.940
<v Speaker 3>Things that you've learned,</v>

2158
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.490
<v Speaker 3>things that you think possibly could help people?</v>

2159
01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:55.080
<v Speaker 3>Cause you obviously have a vision of things and you obviously have a very well</v>

2160
01:01:55.081 --> 01:01:59.070
<v Speaker 3>thought out view of humanity and of consciousness.</v>

2161
01:01:59.540 --> 01:01:59.871
<v Speaker 3>Do you,</v>

2162
01:01:59.871 --> 01:02:02.670
<v Speaker 3>do you feel that you have an obligation to express these thoughts?</v>

2163
01:02:03.330 --> 01:02:08.330
<v Speaker 5>I think that anyone who experiences the deeper realms maybe as it turned about</v>

2164
01:02:10.990 --> 01:02:13.320
<v Speaker 5>and their conscience,</v>

2165
01:02:13.410 --> 01:02:15.570
<v Speaker 5>it's not just about higher consciousness,</v>

2166
01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:16.440
<v Speaker 5>but there's a,</v>

2167
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:20.870
<v Speaker 5>a sense that if you're connected everyone and with everything,</v>

2168
01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:24.660
<v Speaker 5>then what's your moral responsibility or your ethical,</v>

2169
01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:25.470
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2170
01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:30.030
<v Speaker 5>response to your interconnectedness.</v>

2171
01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:31.080
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

2172
01:02:31.810 --> 01:02:32.643
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2173
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.370
<v Speaker 5>if there's a bunch of hippies just took their pants off right now,</v>

2174
01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:38.180
<v Speaker 5>it's like I can't take it to the love.</v>

2175
01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:39.001
<v Speaker 5>It's too much love,</v>

2176
01:02:39.001 --> 01:02:39.834
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2177
01:02:41.690 --> 01:02:42.523
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2178
01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:43.733
<v Speaker 5>I think that,</v>

2179
01:02:43.770 --> 01:02:44.370
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2180
01:02:44.370 --> 01:02:49.370
<v Speaker 5>there's a natural resistance to allowing it to be as magnificent as it actually</v>

2181
01:02:49.831 --> 01:02:50.664
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>

2182
01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:52.440
<v Speaker 5>Also a fear of the unknown too.</v>

2183
01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:53.101
<v Speaker 5>Totally.</v>

2184
01:02:53.101 --> 01:02:54.330
<v Speaker 5>And people that haven't had it,</v>

2185
01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:56.550
<v Speaker 5>I think that that's why I don't fault them.</v>

2186
01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:58.380
<v Speaker 5>The ones who are anti,</v>

2187
01:02:58.980 --> 01:02:59.251
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2188
01:02:59.251 --> 01:03:01.500
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people associate drugs with you're ruining your life,</v>

2189
01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:03.450
<v Speaker 5>not with saving your life.</v>

2190
01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:05.370
<v Speaker 5>They're capable of both.</v>

2191
01:03:05.970 --> 01:03:06.481
<v Speaker 5>Totally.</v>

2192
01:03:06.481 --> 01:03:07.380
<v Speaker 5>In my case,</v>

2193
01:03:07.410 --> 01:03:12.410
<v Speaker 5>it was the other was the saving my life and meeting my wife and 39 years later,</v>

2194
01:03:13.051 --> 01:03:13.884
<v Speaker 5>here we are.</v>

2195
01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:14.700
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2196
01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:19.320
<v Speaker 5>whatever seed was born in the saving of a life,</v>

2197
01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:20.393
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2198
01:03:20.410 --> 01:03:21.090
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

2199
01:03:21.090 --> 01:03:21.421
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2200
01:03:21.421 --> 01:03:23.970
<v Speaker 5>giving a literal turning point and saying,</v>

2201
01:03:23.971 --> 01:03:24.300
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2202
01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:25.680
<v Speaker 5>can you see me now?</v>

2203
01:03:26.070 --> 01:03:26.590
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2204
01:03:26.590 --> 01:03:26.801
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2205
01:03:26.801 --> 01:03:30.040
<v Speaker 1>switch literally was turned on and you became a different person.</v>

2206
01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:32.410
<v Speaker 1>Like shedding a,</v>

2207
01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:33.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2208
01:03:33.050 --> 01:03:34.870
<v Speaker 1>a cocoon and the,</v>

2209
01:03:34.930 --> 01:03:35.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2210
01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:38.410
<v Speaker 1>Caterpillar becomes a butterfly or whatever the fuck happens whenever you have a</v>

2211
01:03:38.411 --> 01:03:39.700
<v Speaker 1>really profound experience.</v>

2212
01:03:39.701 --> 01:03:41.530
<v Speaker 1>But some people don't do that.</v>

2213
01:03:41.531 --> 01:03:42.364
<v Speaker 1>Some people do.</v>

2214
01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:43.060
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2215
01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:46.150
<v Speaker 1>this is what I say is that a really profound psychedelic experience like</v>

2216
01:03:46.151 --> 01:03:46.661
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>

2217
01:03:46.661 --> 01:03:46.961
<v Speaker 1>alt,</v>

2218
01:03:46.961 --> 01:03:51.760
<v Speaker 1>delete for your consciousness where your brain can reboots the fresh operating</v>

2219
01:03:51.761 --> 01:03:56.710
<v Speaker 1>system and there's only one folder on the desktop and the desktop folder says my</v>

2220
01:03:56.711 --> 01:03:57.580
<v Speaker 1>old bullshit.</v>

2221
01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:01.840
<v Speaker 1>And you can either open it up and go right back into these predetermined</v>

2222
01:04:01.841 --> 01:04:05.860
<v Speaker 1>patterns of behavior once a psychedelic experience has faded because it be more</v>

2223
01:04:05.861 --> 01:04:06.651
<v Speaker 1>comfortable that way.</v>

2224
01:04:06.651 --> 01:04:10.960
<v Speaker 1>Then sort of reassessing the way you've been living your life or you know,</v>

2225
01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:16.060
<v Speaker 1>you can hit delete and try to keep going and do DMT again.</v>

2226
01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:19.630
<v Speaker 1>Trying to get right back there right when it stops being fresh.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just reintroduced that my,</v>

2242

<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2243
01:04:37.770 --> 01:04:40.520
<v Speaker 5>effects of past behavior.</v>

2244
01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:42.390
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2245
01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:42.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2246
01:04:42.601 --> 01:04:43.980
<v Speaker 1>You know what's been really tripping me out,</v>

2247
01:04:43.981 --> 01:04:48.000
<v Speaker 1>it was how many people that I know that are starting to have a semi at least</v>

2248
01:04:48.001 --> 01:04:49.980
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic experiences from doing yoga.</v>

2249
01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:51.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2250
01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:56.160
<v Speaker 1>I've had maybe one time in my life or I did yoga and I felt like I was high.</v>

2251
01:04:56.161 --> 01:04:59.400
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I was high on marijuana and that's what it felt like at the end of</v>

2252
01:04:59.401 --> 01:04:59.491
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2253
01:04:59.491 --> 01:04:59.881
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

2254
01:04:59.881 --> 01:05:00.361
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

2255
01:05:00.361 --> 01:05:02.550
<v Speaker 1>It's just like whatever it is that you've stepped,</v>

2256
01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:06.510
<v Speaker 1>that switch that you can hit when you do the right poses for the right amount of</v>

2257
01:05:06.511 --> 01:05:08.190
<v Speaker 1>time with the right amount of energy.</v>

2258
01:05:08.490 --> 01:05:11.640
<v Speaker 1>There's a weird switch that you hit at the end where I was literally high.</v>

2259
01:05:12.030 --> 01:05:13.650
<v Speaker 1>But that's as far as I've ever taken it.</v>

2260
01:05:13.651 --> 01:05:15.420
<v Speaker 1>I've never had a hallucination.</v>

2261
01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:17.770
<v Speaker 1>I've never actually projected,</v>

2262
01:05:17.771 --> 01:05:18.280
<v Speaker 1>I've never,</v>

2263
01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:22.540
<v Speaker 6>but I have heard some of the fucking craziest things from people that practice</v>

2264
01:05:22.541 --> 01:05:26.410
<v Speaker 6>Kundalini Yoga that if I didn't know them really well and the way they were</v>

2265
01:05:26.411 --> 01:05:27.101
<v Speaker 6>telling it to me,</v>

2266
01:05:27.101 --> 01:05:29.080
<v Speaker 6>it's like so matter of factly.</v>

2267
01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.150
<v Speaker 6>I would say this guy's crazy.</v>

2268
01:05:31.151 --> 01:05:34.860
<v Speaker 6>He's just making up a bunch of shit except for the one time that I got myself</v>

2269
01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:36.520
<v Speaker 6>high cause I was really high.</v>

2270
01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:38.110
<v Speaker 6>I mean I was high.</v>

2271
01:05:38.111 --> 01:05:39.070
<v Speaker 6>I felt great.</v>

2272
01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:40.750
<v Speaker 6>I had love in my heart.</v>

2273
01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:42.520
<v Speaker 6>I wanted to hug people.</v>

2274
01:05:42.550 --> 01:05:42.860
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2275
01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:44.740
<v Speaker 6>I felt like colors were brighter,</v>

2276
01:05:44.741 --> 01:05:46.090
<v Speaker 6>sounds were cleaner.</v>

2277
01:05:46.270 --> 01:05:47.740
<v Speaker 6>I really felt really high.</v>

2278
01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:48.521
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

2279
01:05:48.521 --> 01:05:48.710
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2280
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:50.740
<v Speaker 6>it was just from doing yoga and I was like,</v>

2281
01:05:50.741 --> 01:05:51.940
<v Speaker 6>if that's possible,</v>

2282
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.391
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2283
01:05:52.391 --> 01:05:52.690
<v Speaker 6>I've,</v>

2284
01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:55.680
<v Speaker 6>I've never really continually practice Kundalini,</v>

2285
01:05:55.690 --> 01:05:57.150
<v Speaker 6>but the people who really get into,</v>

2286
01:05:57.151 --> 01:05:57.580
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

2287

2288
01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:04.000
<v Speaker 6>they say that there's a wave length that you can hit where you tap into that,</v>

2289
01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:04.961
<v Speaker 6>whatever it is,</v>

2290
01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:06.160
<v Speaker 6>the pineal gland,</v>

2291

<v Speaker 5>for Antionne really came,</v>

2306

2317
01:06:43.221 --> 01:06:44.054
<v Speaker 5>I was saying,</v>

2318

<v Speaker 6>let's be honest.</v>

2348
01:07:14.041 --> 01:07:14.874
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

2349
01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:18.240
<v Speaker 6>You're so psychedelic anyway from point a,</v>

2350
01:07:18.270 --> 01:07:18.521
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>

2351
01:07:18.521 --> 01:07:19.680
<v Speaker 6>you naturally psychedelic.</v>

2352
01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:20.761
<v Speaker 6>And then on top of that,</v>

2353
01:07:20.761 --> 01:07:21.600
<v Speaker 6>all the things you've done,</v>

2354
01:07:21.690 --> 01:07:24.410
<v Speaker 6>how could you ever pretend that you ever on the notch,</v>

2355
01:07:24.570 --> 01:07:26.490
<v Speaker 6>if you're experienced too much to be on the match?</v>

2356
01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:28.180
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2357
01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:32.980
<v Speaker 5>your reference point is now more cosmic then,</v>

2358
01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:33.933
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2359
01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:35.193
<v Speaker 5>sort of,</v>

2360
01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:36.513
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2361
01:07:36.550 --> 01:07:37.383
<v Speaker 5>isolated.</v>

2362
01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:38.080
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2363
01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:42.730
<v Speaker 5>And you feel more connected with people because,</v>

2364
01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:44.710
<v Speaker 5>and it must happen to you.</v>

2365
01:07:45.210 --> 01:07:46.043
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2366
01:07:46.330 --> 01:07:48.220
<v Speaker 5>you have a community,</v>

01:07:51.070 --> 01:07:56.070
<v Speaker 5>met with many of the people that come out to see you over your tour and things</v>

2371
01:07:56.171 --> 01:07:57.004
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>

2372
01:07:57.430 --> 01:07:58.263
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2373

<v Speaker 5>how has your sense of community,</v>

2374
01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:01.600
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2375
01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:03.580
<v Speaker 5>evolved in your understanding?</v>

2376
01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:05.750
<v Speaker 6>That's a good question.</v>

2377
01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:06.410
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2378
01:08:06.410 --> 01:08:08.630
<v Speaker 6>what I've found is that,</v>

2379
01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:09.493
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2380
01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:11.840
<v Speaker 6>by doing something like a podcast,</v>

2381
01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:14.090
<v Speaker 6>having conversations with people like you,</v>

2382
01:08:14.091 --> 01:08:14.541
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

2383
01:08:14.541 --> 01:08:16.550
<v Speaker 6>my friends that come on you,</v>

2384
01:08:16.610 --> 01:08:17.061
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>

2385
01:08:17.061 --> 01:08:18.380
<v Speaker 6>you're sitting,</v>

2386
01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:18.651
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>

2387
01:08:18.651 --> 01:08:20.490
<v Speaker 6>you're putting out like the kind of,</v>

2388
01:08:20.491 --> 01:08:20.750
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2389
01:08:20.750 --> 01:08:22.340
<v Speaker 6>conversations that we're having right now.</v>

2390
01:08:22.530 --> 01:08:27.530
<v Speaker 6>You putting these out to people that live in places where they don't know</v>

2391
01:08:27.531 --> 01:08:28.430
<v Speaker 6>anybody like you.</v>

2392
01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:30.650
<v Speaker 6>They can't get a guy like you to sit down for three hours.</v>

2393
01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:33.750
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't get you to sit down for three hours and just talk like this unless</v>

2394
01:08:33.770 --> 01:08:34.730
<v Speaker 6>we're going to do a podcast.</v>

2395
01:08:34.731 --> 01:08:34.911
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2396
01:08:34.911 --> 01:08:35.744
<v Speaker 6>it probably could,</v>

2397
01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:37.010
<v Speaker 6>but this is the way to do it,</v>

2398
01:08:37.011 --> 01:08:37.161
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2399
01:08:37.161 --> 01:08:38.870
<v Speaker 6>so everybody can be in on it as well.</v>

2400
01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:42.170
<v Speaker 6>But that's one of the best things for me about this podcast is that I'm getting</v>

2401
01:08:42.171 --> 01:08:46.070
<v Speaker 6>to talk to like these people like Chris Ryan or Danieli Bolelli are all these</v>

2402
01:08:46.071 --> 01:08:48.290
<v Speaker 6>interesting people that I get to talk to on a regular basis.</v>

2403
01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:48.951
<v Speaker 6>To me,</v>

2404
01:08:48.951 --> 01:08:49.751
<v Speaker 6>that's a,</v>

2405
01:08:49.751 --> 01:08:54.020
<v Speaker 6>a beautiful little situation that I've stumbled into.</v>

2406
01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:55.370
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

2407
01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:55.941
<v Speaker 6>for me,</v>

2408
01:08:55.941 --> 01:08:56.541
<v Speaker 6>I'm very,</v>

2409
01:08:56.541 --> 01:08:59.510
<v Speaker 6>I feel very fortunate just to be able to have all these conversations with</v>

2410
01:08:59.511 --> 01:09:00.140
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>

2411
01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:05.140
<v Speaker 6>And then now there's a sense of obligation because I know that people enjoy</v>

2412
01:09:05.511 --> 01:09:06.840
<v Speaker 6>these conversations and I want to,</v>

2413
01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:07.520
<v Speaker 6>and I,</v>

2414
01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:10.910
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to ever have them think that I'm not going to do it anymore.</v>

2415
01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:12.080
<v Speaker 6>We're going to keep just going like,</v>

2416
01:09:12.081 --> 01:09:12.471
<v Speaker 6>it's fun.</v>

2417
01:09:12.471 --> 01:09:13.161
<v Speaker 6>I know you enjoy it.</v>

2418
01:09:13.161 --> 01:09:13.994
<v Speaker 6>I enjoy it too.</v>

2419
01:09:14.090 --> 01:09:15.320
<v Speaker 6>It's totally mutual.</v>

2420
01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:16.131
<v Speaker 6>Thanks a lot.</v>

2421
01:09:16.131 --> 01:09:17.030
<v Speaker 6>I'm glad you like it.</v>

2422
01:09:17.270 --> 01:09:20.120
<v Speaker 6>And I think with that,</v>

2423
01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:23.120
<v Speaker 6>it's with that attitude we've,</v>

2424
01:09:23.210 --> 01:09:24.290
<v Speaker 6>we've created,</v>

2425
01:09:24.350 --> 01:09:24.650
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2426
01:09:24.650 --> 01:09:25.040
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

2427
01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:30.040
<v Speaker 6>this group of people that listen to the podcast and maybe they've never had like</v>

2428
01:09:32.541 --> 01:09:35.720
<v Speaker 6>really introspective conversations with people.</v>

2429
01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:36.111
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2430
01:09:36.111 --> 01:09:41.111
<v Speaker 6>maybe they've never really thought about living in another part of the world or</v>

2431
01:09:41.330 --> 01:09:46.330
<v Speaker 6>maybe they've never thought about expanding the life that they live outside of</v>

2432
01:09:46.461 --> 01:09:50.210
<v Speaker 6>this one realm of consciousness that they've inhabited their whole life.</v>

2433
01:09:50.210 --> 01:09:51.740
<v Speaker 6>One way of looking at the world,</v>

2434
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:53.750
<v Speaker 6>whether it's racist or,</v>

2435
01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:58.820
<v Speaker 6>or glutinous or whether they've just been abusing their body or whether they</v>

2436
01:09:58.971 --> 01:10:01.310
<v Speaker 6>just been lazy about getting things done.</v>

2437
01:10:01.610 --> 01:10:03.000
<v Speaker 6>And when you,</v>

2438
01:10:03.001 --> 01:10:08.001
<v Speaker 6>you hear a podcast where you get a chance to see all these different people's</v>

2439
01:10:08.451 --> 01:10:09.650
<v Speaker 6>takes on things.</v>

2440
01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:10.460
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2441
01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:12.770
<v Speaker 6>from Everlast a singer too,</v>

2442
01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:15.710
<v Speaker 6>my friend Joey Diaz and all these different people's takes on things,</v>

2443
01:10:15.711 --> 01:10:20.090
<v Speaker 6>they're all different and dynamic and all having access to that.</v>

2444
01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:24.110
<v Speaker 6>It's like having a bunch of like really smart friends around you all the time.</v>

2445
01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:26.300
<v Speaker 6>So if you can listen to these podcasts,</v>

2446
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:28.040
<v Speaker 6>not everybody's really smart,</v>

2447
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:28.761
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2448
01:10:28.761 --> 01:10:29.150
<v Speaker 6>I'm not,</v>

2449
01:10:29.150 --> 01:10:29.983
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying we're,</v>

2450
01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:31.070
<v Speaker 6>we're all really smart.</v>

2451
01:10:31.210 --> 01:10:32.360
<v Speaker 6>I'm saying some of them are really smart.</v>

2452
01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:36.620
<v Speaker 6>But if you get a chance to have these interesting conversations and they enrich</v>

2453
01:10:36.621 --> 01:10:40.130
<v Speaker 6>people's consciousness because you might be stuck in a bad spot.</v>

2454
01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:42.710
<v Speaker 6>I've been in a bad spot in my life where I didn't have a lot of cool people to</v>

2455
01:10:42.711 --> 01:10:43.510
<v Speaker 6>talk to.</v>

2456
01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:45.320
<v Speaker 6>You couldn't just tune into a podcast,</v>

2457
01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:46.160
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

2458
01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:48.980
<v Speaker 6>And so my sense of community is sort of a,</v>

2459
01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:54.950
<v Speaker 6>it's one become a thing of obligation of on an a happy obligation.</v>

2460
01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:59.540
<v Speaker 6>But I definitely think we're obligated to continue to provide content.</v>

2461
01:10:59.541 --> 01:10:59.901
<v Speaker 6>And it's,</v>

2462
01:10:59.901 --> 01:11:00.200
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2463
01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:00.520
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2464
01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:05.520
<v Speaker 6>I remember being addicted to radio shows or different bands when I was a kid and</v>

2465
01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:07.370
<v Speaker 6>you want more stuff,</v>

2466
01:11:07.371 --> 01:11:08.660
<v Speaker 6>you want constantly more stuff.</v>

2467
01:11:08.930 --> 01:11:09.410
<v Speaker 6>So we're,</v>

2468
01:11:09.410 --> 01:11:09.921
<v Speaker 6>we're,</v>

2469
01:11:09.921 --> 01:11:10.670
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2470
01:11:10.670 --> 01:11:12.530
<v Speaker 6>that's a big part of community with me,</v>

2471
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:13.663
<v Speaker 6>but it's also</v>

2472
01:11:14.730 --> 01:11:15.780
<v Speaker 1>one of the most,</v>

2473
01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:20.490
<v Speaker 1>the happiest things that I've gotten from this podcast is people coming up to me</v>

2474
01:11:20.491 --> 01:11:23.460
<v Speaker 1>telling me that it changed the way they,</v>

2475
01:11:23.550 --> 01:11:26.640
<v Speaker 1>they think about things telling me that now they're,</v>

2476
01:11:26.641 --> 01:11:29.670
<v Speaker 1>they're happy telling me that now they eat healthy,</v>

2477
01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:33.250
<v Speaker 1>telling me that now they just stop being an asshole to people that they realize</v>

2478
01:11:33.251 --> 01:11:35.970
<v Speaker 1>they were really just frustrated and they need to get their shit together and</v>

2479
01:11:35.971 --> 01:11:38.370
<v Speaker 1>then it's over and over and over again.</v>

2480
01:11:38.670 --> 01:11:39.151
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2481
01:11:39.151 --> 01:11:40.140
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

2482
01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:41.610
<v Speaker 1>that sense of community,</v>

2483
01:11:41.611 --> 01:11:43.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was completely accidental.</v>

2484
01:11:43.770 --> 01:11:46.630
<v Speaker 1>We didn't set out to try to create some sort of a,</v>

2485
01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:49.230
<v Speaker 1>a group that sort of tunes into,</v>

2486
01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:51.180
<v Speaker 1>we just hope people enjoy the podcast.</v>

2487
01:11:51.450 --> 01:11:53.130
<v Speaker 1>We didn't think it was going to be a,</v>

2488
01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:55.240
<v Speaker 5>I know it,</v>

2489
01:11:55.240 --> 01:12:00.240
<v Speaker 5>it's a very interesting thing when do a group of supportive listeners become a</v>

2490
01:12:01.211 --> 01:12:02.044
<v Speaker 5>community?</v>

2491
01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:03.610
<v Speaker 5>And it's kind of like,</v>

2492
01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:04.210
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2493
01:12:04.210 --> 01:12:05.500
<v Speaker 5>we see,</v>

2494
01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:06.280
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2495
01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:11.280
<v Speaker 5>that today people would like to gather in a lot of different places and,</v>

2496
01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:13.960
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2497
01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:14.793
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

2498
01:12:14.850 --> 01:12:15.580
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2499
01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:17.190
<v Speaker 5>coalesce for,</v>

2500
01:12:17.550 --> 01:12:18.360
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2501
01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:20.590
<v Speaker 5>a few hours and,</v>

2502
01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:21.130
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2503
01:12:21.130 --> 01:12:23.470
<v Speaker 5>have a temporary community.</v>

2504
01:12:23.970 --> 01:12:24.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2505
01:12:24.270 --> 01:12:26.070
<v Speaker 1>I think we'd like to have a full community,</v>

2506
01:12:26.071 --> 01:12:28.020
<v Speaker 1>but we don't trust people that knocked at fucking cookie.</v>

2507
01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:30.600
<v Speaker 1>Not everybody has their shit together.</v>

2508
01:12:30.601 --> 01:12:30.721
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2509
01:12:30.721 --> 01:12:31.920
<v Speaker 1>you can't just walk into my house.</v>

2510
01:12:31.921 --> 01:12:32.680
<v Speaker 1>You might be nuts.</v>

2511
01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:34.040
<v Speaker 1>And that's true.</v>

2512
01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:35.221
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>

2513
01:12:35.221 --> 01:12:35.701
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired.</v>

2514
01:12:35.701 --> 01:12:36.421
<v Speaker 1>I just got home from work.</v>

2515
01:12:36.421 --> 01:12:37.470
<v Speaker 1>I'd really like to just watch TV.</v>

2516
01:12:37.471 --> 01:12:38.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't want you to come over my house.</v>

2517
01:12:38.730 --> 01:12:40.650
<v Speaker 1>So there's a certain boundary that we all have to set up.</v>

2518
01:12:42.010 --> 01:12:44.710
<v Speaker 5>That's why the church model of the,</v>

2519
01:12:44.770 --> 01:12:45.251
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2520
01:12:45.251 --> 01:12:45.520
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2521
01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:48.820
<v Speaker 5>there's a time when you devote some time to,</v>

2522
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:49.180
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2523
01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:50.020
<v Speaker 5>this other thing too,</v>

2524
01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:51.041
<v Speaker 5>that's going on,</v>

2525
01:12:51.041 --> 01:12:56.041
<v Speaker 5>that's more of a community thing and that's why I ask about it because it's</v>

2526
01:12:57.971 --> 01:13:00.760
<v Speaker 5>something that we've been thinking about a lot.</v>

2527
01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:02.480
<v Speaker 1>It's going to happen on its own.</v>

2528
01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:03.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

2529
01:13:03.330 --> 01:13:04.290
<v Speaker 1>people are going to gravitate.</v>

2530
01:13:04.291 --> 01:13:04.771
<v Speaker 1>I told you,</v>

2531
01:13:04.771 --> 01:13:05.460
<v Speaker 1>although the,</v>

2532
01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:08.610
<v Speaker 1>all the fringe people all over the planet are coming to you.</v>

2533
01:13:08.611 --> 01:13:12.210
<v Speaker 1>My friend [inaudible] going to zoom in on it along with some cops.</v>

2534
01:13:12.211 --> 01:13:12.900
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>

2535
01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:15.540
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get some undercover cops that are going to try to pretend to be</v>

2536
01:13:15.541 --> 01:13:19.160
<v Speaker 1>your friends and try to get deep into the organization and find out you're for</v>

2537
01:13:19.170 --> 01:13:19.830
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

2538
01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:21.150
<v Speaker 1>And then eventually they'll admit it to you.</v>

2539
01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:22.280
<v Speaker 1>It'll give him some acid.</v>

2540
01:13:22.281 --> 01:13:23.114
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you they're a cop.</v>

2541
01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:24.270
<v Speaker 1>No apologize.</v>

2542
01:13:24.271 --> 01:13:25.600
<v Speaker 1>And you'll say it's okay and you'll give up.</v>

2543
01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:26.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2544
01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:26.980
<v Speaker 5>we don't cry.</v>

2545
01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:30.190
<v Speaker 5>Give anything to anyone really.</v>

2546
01:13:30.250 --> 01:13:30.910
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2547
01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:33.280
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying advocate that much.</v>

2548
01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:36.280
<v Speaker 5>We do tell the truth about what happened to us.</v>

2549
01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:37.890
<v Speaker 5>And I'm a,</v>

2550
01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:39.940
<v Speaker 5>and I'm of the belief that,</v>

2551
01:13:40.050 --> 01:13:40.883
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2552
01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:43.780
<v Speaker 5>the discovery of,</v>

2553
01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:47.230
<v Speaker 5>of LSD 70 years ago this year,</v>

2554
01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:48.310
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2555
01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:48.850
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

2556
01:13:48.850 --> 01:13:49.360
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2557
01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:54.360
<v Speaker 5>quite a miraculous occurrence and probably have,</v>

2558
01:13:55.670 --> 01:13:56.110
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2559
01:13:56.110 --> 01:14:01.110
<v Speaker 5>a religious importance to humanity in the great scheme of things.</v>

2560
01:14:01.330 --> 01:14:06.330
<v Speaker 5>And I think 70 years after the crucifixion,</v>

2561
01:14:06.611 --> 01:14:07.444
<v Speaker 5>basically,</v>

2562
01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:10.030
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't going so well for the Christians,</v>

2563
01:14:10.031 --> 01:14:10.864
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2564
01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:11.710
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2565
01:14:11.710 --> 01:14:12.310
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2566
01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:13.720
<v Speaker 5>so there's,</v>

2567
01:14:13.721 --> 01:14:14.180
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2568
01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:15.013
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2569
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.700
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2570
01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:15.801
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2571
01:14:15.801 --> 01:14:16.634
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>

2572
01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:17.860
<v Speaker 5>you know that.</v>

2573
01:14:17.861 --> 01:14:19.630
<v Speaker 5>And that's why I was trying to think of,</v>

2574
01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:20.501
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2575
01:14:20.501 --> 01:14:24.280
<v Speaker 5>this is kind of like a civil rights issue,</v>

2576
01:14:24.610 --> 01:14:25.540
<v Speaker 5>that it is,</v>

2577
01:14:25.541 --> 01:14:26.080
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2578
01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:26.913
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2579
01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:32.550
<v Speaker 5>pointing toward a higher freedom of consciousness and a,</v>

2580
01:14:32.741 --> 01:14:34.240
<v Speaker 5>the end special,</v>

2581
01:14:34.450 --> 01:14:35.283
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2582
01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:36.790
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2583
01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:37.623
<v Speaker 5>places.</v>

2584
01:14:37.690 --> 01:14:38.670
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying they,</v>

2585
01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:42.160
<v Speaker 5>these are not a potentially dangerous substances,</v>

2586
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:43.090
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2587
01:14:43.090 --> 01:14:46.960
<v Speaker 5>and in the wrong hands of the wrong time and things like that,</v>

2588
01:14:46.961 --> 01:14:48.340
<v Speaker 5>it's can be a tangible,</v>

2589
01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:49.270
<v Speaker 5>a weapon even,</v>

2590
01:14:49.630 --> 01:14:49.931
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

2591
01:14:49.931 --> 01:14:50.560
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2592
01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:50.951
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2593
01:14:50.951 --> 01:14:51.310
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

2594
01:14:51.310 --> 01:14:52.390
<v Speaker 5>there definitely,</v>

2595
01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:53.340
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2596
01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:53.560
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2597
01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:57.820
<v Speaker 5>things that shouldn't be toyed with and some people should stay very clear of</v>

2598
01:14:57.821 --> 01:14:58.654
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

2599
01:14:58.720 --> 01:14:59.200
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2600
01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:00.460
<v Speaker 5>they happen to be,</v>

2601
01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:01.353
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2602
01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:05.860
<v Speaker 5>something that gave us tremendous insight and I think many other people as well,</v>

2603
01:15:05.861 --> 01:15:07.450
<v Speaker 5>not because I said so,</v>

2604
01:15:07.690 --> 01:15:10.720
<v Speaker 5>but because people naturally have discovered this.</v>

2605
01:15:10.721 --> 01:15:11.650
<v Speaker 5>It's part of,</v>

2606
01:15:11.890 --> 01:15:13.840
<v Speaker 5>it's a part of contemporary culture even.</v>

2607
01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:15.500
<v Speaker 1>It's just a weird thing that we have.</v>

2608
01:15:15.501 --> 01:15:18.680
<v Speaker 1>Once we write things down on paper and we say this is a law,</v>

2609
01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:22.670
<v Speaker 1>even when it gets to the overwhelming breaking point,</v>

2610
01:15:22.671 --> 01:15:23.390
<v Speaker 1>and it's probably,</v>

2611
01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:24.980
<v Speaker 1>it's probably not there with psychedelics,</v>

2612
01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:26.300
<v Speaker 1>I think it is with pot.</v>

2613
01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:30.890
<v Speaker 1>But when it gets to the undeniable breaking point where people just,</v>

2614
01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:31.411
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2615
01:15:31.411 --> 01:15:31.731
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

2616
01:15:31.731 --> 01:15:32.031
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2617
01:15:32.031 --> 01:15:34.730
<v Speaker 1>like 70% can say they favor legalization.</v>

2618
01:15:34.731 --> 01:15:35.540
<v Speaker 1>Like oop,</v>

2619
01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:36.373
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

2620
01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:37.161
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

2621
01:15:37.161 --> 01:15:38.300
<v Speaker 1>it's not up for grabs.</v>

2622
01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:41.510
<v Speaker 1>The federal government's not really interested in what your real oh,</v>

2623
01:15:41.511 --> 01:15:42.141
<v Speaker 1>70%.</v>

2624
01:15:42.141 --> 01:15:42.830
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

2625
01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:46.070
<v Speaker 1>Call us when it's 1000000% and will still tell you to fuck yourself.</v>

2626
01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:47.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like they just,</v>

2627
01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:48.853
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2628
01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:50.810
<v Speaker 1>the laws don't make any sense.</v>

2629
01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:52.740
<v Speaker 1>And it only points at this point at this,</v>

2630
01:15:52.741 --> 01:15:54.290
<v Speaker 1>this is time to suppression.</v>

2631
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:54.921
<v Speaker 1>This is the only,</v>

2632
01:15:54.921 --> 01:15:56.090
<v Speaker 1>that's the only thing that makes sense.</v>

2633
01:15:56.270 --> 01:15:57.680
<v Speaker 1>They're nonlethal okay.</v>

2634
01:15:57.681 --> 01:15:59.450
<v Speaker 1>They're not lethal life changing.</v>

2635
01:15:59.690 --> 01:16:02.090
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of people that give it five stars on Yelp.</v>

2636
01:16:02.150 --> 01:16:02.983
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2637
01:16:03.530 --> 01:16:03.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2638
01:16:03.890 --> 01:16:06.470
<v Speaker 1>this means people events a bad times on mushrooms.</v>

2639
01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:07.161
<v Speaker 1>That's a fact.</v>

2640
01:16:07.161 --> 01:16:07.941
<v Speaker 1>But if,</v>

2641
01:16:07.941 --> 01:16:08.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2642
01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:09.710
<v Speaker 1>if mushrooms had a Yelp page,</v>

2643
01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:10.940
<v Speaker 1>it would be a motherfucker.</v>

2644
01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:13.970
<v Speaker 1>That shit would be filled with stars and there would be like,</v>

2645
01:16:14.030 --> 01:16:14.863
<v Speaker 1>but link to,</v>

2646
01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:17.990
<v Speaker 1>it'd be every one of those reviews would say more at the bottom.</v>

2647
01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:21.890
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to click to get an extra pair of mantra to infinite stars.</v>

2648
01:16:21.891 --> 01:16:22.680
<v Speaker 1>Are there?</v>

2649
01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:23.513
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2650
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:24.201
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't.</v>

2651
01:16:24.201 --> 01:16:24.770
<v Speaker 1>It would be.</v>

2652
01:16:24.770 --> 01:16:25.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2653
01:16:25.101 --> 01:16:26.990
<v Speaker 1>If you had less than five stars from mushrooms,</v>

2654
01:16:26.991 --> 01:16:27.824
<v Speaker 1>you're an asshole.</v>

2655
01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:29.510
<v Speaker 1>Give it five stars.</v>

2656
01:16:29.511 --> 01:16:30.340
<v Speaker 1>Stupid.</v>

2657
01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:31.730
<v Speaker 1>It was the best thing that ever happened to you.</v>

2658
01:16:32.050 --> 01:16:32.421
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're,</v>

2659
01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:33.770
<v Speaker 1>they're the Johns Hopkins University.</v>

2660
01:16:33.771 --> 01:16:37.910
<v Speaker 1>He's now starting to public studies saying that just one mushroom trip 20 years</v>

2661
01:16:37.911 --> 01:16:38.101
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

2662
01:16:38.101 --> 01:16:41.570
<v Speaker 1>It was a profound effect on personality and improve people's outlook and,</v>

2663
01:16:41.571 --> 01:16:43.070
<v Speaker 1>and their level of happiness.</v>

2664
01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Like it makes it can make people happier.</v>

2665
01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.810
<v Speaker 1>That sounds so stupid that it's illegal.</v>

2666
01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:49.603
<v Speaker 1>Literally.</v>

2667
01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:51.200
<v Speaker 1>How many people are like you?</v>

2668
01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:52.280
<v Speaker 1>How many people are like,</v>

2669
01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:52.850
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2670
01:16:52.850 --> 01:16:56.480
<v Speaker 1>I just needed that reset and with a loving person that I meet,</v>

2671
01:16:56.481 --> 01:16:58.250
<v Speaker 1>I have a great time and then all of a sudden,</v>

2672
01:16:58.251 --> 01:16:58.641
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

2673
01:16:58.641 --> 01:17:00.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm off to the races on a totally different track.</v>

2674
01:17:01.370 --> 01:17:04.080
<v Speaker 1>How many people have to say that before we,</v>

2675
01:17:04.230 --> 01:17:05.360
<v Speaker 1>we as a culture go,</v>

2676
01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:06.110
<v Speaker 1>well isn't this,</v>

2677
01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:07.790
<v Speaker 1>this Alex Gray is like way cooler.</v>

2678
01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:09.560
<v Speaker 1>He's like a bit way better look.</v>

2679
01:17:09.561 --> 01:17:10.790
<v Speaker 1>He makes amazing art.</v>

2680
01:17:10.791 --> 01:17:11.571
<v Speaker 1>He's a nice guy.</v>

2681
01:17:11.571 --> 01:17:12.231
<v Speaker 1>He's happy,</v>

2682
01:17:12.231 --> 01:17:13.064
<v Speaker 1>he seems fulfilled.</v>

2683
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:16.910
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to create a center of beautiful building where people can come and</v>

2684
01:17:16.911 --> 01:17:17.900
<v Speaker 1>worship all this stuff.</v>

2685
01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:18.261
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2686
01:17:18.261 --> 01:17:18.540
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2687
01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:19.490
<v Speaker 1>what is wrong with that?</v>

2688
01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:20.900
<v Speaker 1>What's going on here?</v>

2689
01:17:21.230 --> 01:17:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Like what are we trying to protect people from time protect.</v>

2690
01:17:23.961 --> 01:17:26.270
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like you're trying to protect people from enlightenment.</v>

2691
01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:28.190
<v Speaker 1>That would sound preposterous.</v>

2692
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:29.660
<v Speaker 1>What kind of,</v>

2693
01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:32.900
<v Speaker 1>what kind of a benevolent leader would you be if you try to protect people from</v>

2694
01:17:32.901 --> 01:17:34.010
<v Speaker 1>potential enlightenment?</v>

2695
01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:38.240
<v Speaker 1>Or are you scared of potential enlightenment yourself and knowing that if you do</v>

2696
01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:39.470
<v Speaker 1>take mushrooms,</v>

2697
01:17:39.471 --> 01:17:43.040
<v Speaker 1>you can't put on the bulletproof vest and tear gas to kids.</v>

2698
01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:44.150
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

2699
01:17:44.150 --> 01:17:45.080
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to do it.</v>

2700
01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:45.531
<v Speaker 1>You're not,</v>

2701
01:17:45.531 --> 01:17:49.070
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be the pepper spray cop when the kids are protesting because</v>

2702
01:17:49.071 --> 01:17:50.740
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to be able to conscience</v>

2703
01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:53.490
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] and you,</v>

2704
01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:54.600
<v Speaker 5>you learn to do</v>

2705
01:17:54.690 --> 01:17:54.901
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2706
01:17:54.901 --> 01:17:55.830
<v Speaker 1>Do that gig anymore.</v>

2707
01:17:55.890 --> 01:17:56.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2708
01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:57.420
<v Speaker 1>You got to get a new gig.</v>

2709
01:17:59.930 --> 01:18:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Or if you do do it,</v>

2710
01:18:01.171 --> 01:18:02.280
<v Speaker 1>you'll have nightmares.</v>

2711
01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:03.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2712
01:18:03.630 --> 01:18:04.000
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2713
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Imagine doing mushrooms and then pepper spraying kids.</v>

2714
01:18:06.210 --> 01:18:07.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2715
01:18:07.410 --> 01:18:10.860
<v Speaker 1>The demonic nightmares that you would have for decades.</v>

2716
01:18:11.490 --> 01:18:11.880
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2717
01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:12.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2718
01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:12.830
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2719
01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:17.830
<v Speaker 1>and then the habits that you'd a form to avoid a confronting them.</v>

2720
01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:18.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2721
01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:19.201
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

2722
01:18:19.201 --> 01:18:19.681
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

2723
01:18:19.681 --> 01:18:22.320
<v Speaker 1>He would become a fucking gambling addicts for sure.</v>

2724
01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:25.170
<v Speaker 1>Three cigarettes in your mouth at the same time</v>

2725
01:18:26.690 --> 01:18:29.040
<v Speaker 1>looking at bet on a roach cross at a parking lot,</v>

2726
01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:30.620
<v Speaker 1>you're better than anything.</v>

2727
01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:32.910
<v Speaker 1>There's whatever to distract yourself from.</v>

2728
01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:37.140
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of people out there that just got started off in a bad way mean it's</v>

2729
01:18:37.141 --> 01:18:37.500
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

2730
01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:41.580
<v Speaker 1>And very few things can help them except psychedelic experiences.</v>

2731
01:18:41.581 --> 01:18:43.950
<v Speaker 1>Are there one of the best ways to affect those?</v>

2732
01:18:43.951 --> 01:18:45.120
<v Speaker 1>And like we said,</v>

2733
01:18:45.121 --> 01:18:46.800
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have to be a drug.</v>

2734
01:18:47.130 --> 01:18:49.440
<v Speaker 1>You can get psychedelic experience just through meditation,</v>

2735
01:18:49.441 --> 01:18:49.621
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

2736
01:18:49.621 --> 01:18:49.951
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

2737
01:18:49.951 --> 01:18:50.121
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

2738
01:18:50.121 --> 01:18:50.321
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

2739
01:18:50.321 --> 01:18:51.240
<v Speaker 1>you've practiced it enough,</v>

2740
01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:52.133
<v Speaker 1>allegedly,</v>

2741
01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:53.010
<v Speaker 1>he says he's done it,</v>

2742
01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:53.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2743
01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:55.290
<v Speaker 1>I've never got there other than getting high,</v>

2744
01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:58.980
<v Speaker 5>you're saying like doing the yoga and meditation,</v>

2745
01:18:59.010 --> 01:19:00.960
<v Speaker 5>even not for a long time.</v>

2746
01:19:00.961 --> 01:19:03.900
<v Speaker 5>There are many different approaches to meditation.</v>

2747
01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:04.261
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2748
01:19:04.261 --> 01:19:06.780
<v Speaker 5>from the simplest kind of watching your breath,</v>

2749
01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:07.703
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2750

<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2756
01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:14.870
<v Speaker 5>Alison talks about an aesthetic kind of reception of considering each moment</v>

2757
01:19:14.911 --> 01:19:15.211
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2758
01:19:15.211 --> 01:19:15.900

<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2796
01:19:57.090 --> 01:20:00.870
<v Speaker 5>I feel like these are these podcasts and things like that are the,</v>

2797
01:20:01.410 --> 01:20:04.620
<v Speaker 5>are the mushroom fruit of,</v>

2798
01:20:04.621 --> 01:20:04.920
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2799
01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:09.670
<v Speaker 5>my Celio body of underground intelligences that interweave.</v>

2800
01:20:09.810 --> 01:20:10.643
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

2801
01:20:10.690 --> 01:20:13.740
<v Speaker 5>then they pop out on these special occasions.</v>

2802
01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:14.701
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2803
01:20:14.701 --> 01:20:15.480
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2804
01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:19.330
<v Speaker 1>well it's a door to open people up to people like you to new possibilities,</v>

2805
01:20:19.331 --> 01:20:20.050
<v Speaker 1>new ways,</v>

2806
01:20:20.050 --> 01:20:21.160
<v Speaker 1>new ways of thinking.</v>

2807
01:20:21.550 --> 01:20:26.020
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes that's all you need is just one unique idea that's putting your</v>

2808
01:20:26.021 --> 01:20:27.820
<v Speaker 1>head by someone that you don't even know.</v>

2809
01:20:27.821 --> 01:20:31.930
<v Speaker 1>Just listening to him talk to somebody else and that thought sends you off in a</v>

2810
01:20:31.931 --> 01:20:32.711
<v Speaker 1>different direction.</v>

2811
01:20:32.711 --> 01:20:34.780
<v Speaker 1>A person's words can be psychedelic,</v>

2812
01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:37.270
<v Speaker 1>is I'll a lot of different things.</v>

2813
01:20:37.330 --> 01:20:38.890
<v Speaker 1>Childbirth can be psychedelic.</v>

2814
01:20:38.891 --> 01:20:42.460
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of different things that happened to you in this life that are</v>

2815
01:20:42.461 --> 01:20:42.611
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

2816
01:20:42.611 --> 01:20:43.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2817
01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:43.471
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2818
01:20:43.471 --> 01:20:47.950
<v Speaker 1>we think of psychedelics as being hallucinations and we think of them as being</v>

2819
01:20:47.951 --> 01:20:49.870
<v Speaker 1>sort of a child's fair.</v>

2820
01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:51.070
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

2821
01:20:51.070 --> 01:20:55.780
<v Speaker 1>the reality is that there's a lot that comes out of them that it's very</v>

2822
01:20:55.781 --> 01:21:00.781
<v Speaker 1>difficult to get any other way and the way it comes out so reliably,</v>

2823
01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:06.540
<v Speaker 1>it's like no one is like mushrooms work for almost everyone on the planet.</v>

2824
01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:08.890
<v Speaker 1>Like no one's immune.</v>

2825
01:21:09.250 --> 01:21:12.130
<v Speaker 1>Like you could be out of focus and not really get there with,</v>

2826
01:21:12.190 --> 01:21:12.821
<v Speaker 1>and Delaney,</v>

2827
01:21:12.821 --> 01:21:15.820
<v Speaker 1>you really just can never really get your shit and groove and you just have a</v>

2828
01:21:15.821 --> 01:21:16.654
<v Speaker 1>bad class.</v>

2829
01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:18.550
<v Speaker 1>You take five grams of mushrooms,</v>

2830
01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:19.450
<v Speaker 1>you're off to the moon,</v>

2831
01:21:19.451 --> 01:21:20.500
<v Speaker 1>no matter if you like it or not,</v>

2832
01:21:20.980 --> 01:21:21.400
<v Speaker 1>you're going to,</v>

2833
01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:26.350
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get sucked into the wake and hopefully you can let go ride it</v>

2834
01:21:26.351 --> 01:21:27.850
<v Speaker 1>out and be okay.</v>

2835
01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:33.190
<v Speaker 1>But you might just clench up and it might just go haywire.</v>

2836
01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:34.533
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2837

2858
01:22:09.070 --> 01:22:12.130
<v Speaker 5>we up with Ding like Bach and stuff like that.</v>

2859
01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:13.870
<v Speaker 5>Kind of heavy for some people,</v>

2860
01:22:13.871 --> 01:22:17.510
<v Speaker 5>but I thought I was going to say Christian rock now,</v>

2867
01:22:24.850 --> 01:22:29.410
<v Speaker 5>but it favored the tripping mind with all the few gigs and things like that.</v>

2868
01:22:29.411 --> 01:22:30.540
<v Speaker 5>The infinitizes,</v>

<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2985
01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:24.340

<v Speaker 5>congregation and also an interfaith,</v>

2989
01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:35.470

<v Speaker 5>kind of camp.</v>

2991
01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:38.860
<v Speaker 5>So they had a very,</v>

2992
01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:39.813
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2993
01:25:40.030 --> 01:25:45.030
<v Speaker 5>trans denominational or interfaith kind of approach to spirituality and they had</v>

2994

2995

2996
01:25:50.831 --> 01:25:54.190
<v Speaker 5>we felt like we had a lot in common that we,</v>

01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:55.450
<v Speaker 5>our message was,</v>

<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2999
01:25:55.990 --> 01:26:00.990
<v Speaker 5>I an attempted at a universal message of spirituality and interconnectedness and</v>

3000
01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:08.020
<v Speaker 5>using nature as a setting for this kind of sole renewing,</v>

3001
01:26:10.490 --> 01:26:10.850
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3002
01:26:10.850 --> 01:26:13.940
<v Speaker 5>kind of surrounding in a creative environment.</v>

3003
01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:15.200
<v Speaker 5>So we do,</v>

3004
01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:16.103
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3005
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:17.180
<v Speaker 5>all kinds of,</v>

3006
01:26:17.350 --> 01:26:17.630
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3007
01:26:17.630 --> 01:26:20.300
<v Speaker 5>creativity classes there from dancing and,</v>

3008
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.960
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3009
01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:22.310
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

3010
01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:23.360
<v Speaker 5>movement and,</v>

3011
01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:24.360
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3012
01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:27.740
<v Speaker 5>the yoga and meditation and things like that too.</v>

3013
01:26:27.810 --> 01:26:30.090
<v Speaker 5>How much of the places where the outside is,</v>

3014
01:26:30.110 --> 01:26:31.340
<v Speaker 5>the inside is done,</v>

3015
01:26:31.370 --> 01:26:36.110
<v Speaker 5>it's just the outside needs to be completed with the artwork with end fee on,</v>

3016
01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:37.040
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3017
01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:37.850
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3018
01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:38.120
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3019
01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:39.830
<v Speaker 5>what we have is a,</v>

3020
01:26:40.730 --> 01:26:41.270
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3021
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:46.270
<v Speaker 5>old carriage house and it's been structurally reinforced and a w we've actually</v>

3022
01:26:47.961 --> 01:26:52.040
<v Speaker 5>put quite a bit into it already in a ceiling and shoring it up.</v>

3023
01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:57.640
<v Speaker 5>But then we have to take the roof off and we have to establish a new steel</v>

3024
01:26:58.101 --> 01:27:00.290
<v Speaker 5>foundations in all the corners.</v>

3025
01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:01.550
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

3026
01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:02.383
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3027
01:27:02.690 --> 01:27:07.690
<v Speaker 5>we're building the heads 16 feet away from the entry to the brick building.</v>

3028
01:27:11.090 --> 01:27:16.090
<v Speaker 5>So what you'll have is it large atrium in front of the brick building when you</v>

3029
01:27:16.281 --> 01:27:17.990
<v Speaker 5>walk into La,</v>

3030
01:27:18.050 --> 01:27:20.420
<v Speaker 5>into NT on and with this,</v>

3031
01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:20.750
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3032
01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:22.100
<v Speaker 5>there'll be the reception,</v>

3033
01:27:22.130 --> 01:27:22.640
<v Speaker 5>there'll be,</v>

3034
01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:22.911
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3035
01:27:22.911 --> 01:27:25.640
<v Speaker 5>bathroom and coke because it and things like that,</v>

3036
01:27:25.641 --> 01:27:28.010
<v Speaker 5>but there'll also be a fountain had there,</v>

3037
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.281
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3038
01:27:28.281 --> 01:27:32.930
<v Speaker 5>that will mount against the wall of this old carriage house.</v>

3039
01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:37.640
<v Speaker 5>So you'll see this dramatic kind of 75 by 23 foot high,</v>

3040
01:27:38.060 --> 01:27:39.890
<v Speaker 5>a wall of brick.</v>

3041
01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:40.760
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3042
01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:41.401

3045
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:43.440

01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:43.580

01:27:44.991 --> 01:27:45.410
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3050
01:27:45.410 --> 01:27:45.681
<v Speaker 5>Put it,</v>

3051
01:27:45.681 --> 01:27:46.520
<v Speaker 5>pulled it all the way back,</v>

3052
01:27:46.521 --> 01:27:47.380
<v Speaker 5>Brian for a second.</v>

3053
01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:49.513
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

3054
01:27:49.850 --> 01:27:50.451
<v Speaker 5>the uh,</v>

3055
01:27:50.451 --> 01:27:53.330
<v Speaker 5>the construction looks like pretty in depth.</v>

3056
01:27:53.331 --> 01:27:54.590
<v Speaker 5>Like you guys did a lot of,</v>

3057
01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:56.510
<v Speaker 5>a lot of stuff for the Plos.</v>

3058
01:27:56.630 --> 01:27:57.440
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

3059
01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:58.150
<v Speaker 5>It's been,</v>

3060
01:27:58.150 --> 01:27:59.780
<v Speaker 5>are you living inside of that as well?</v>

3061
01:27:59.781 --> 01:28:00.111
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3062
01:28:00.111 --> 01:28:00.770
<v Speaker 5>we are not.</v>

3063
01:28:00.770 --> 01:28:03.440
<v Speaker 5>There's the brick carriage house and uh,</v>

3064
01:28:04.010 --> 01:28:05.930
<v Speaker 5>so we're going to,</v>

3065
01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:07.650
<v Speaker 5>we've been showing it up.</v>

3066
01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:08.060
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3067
01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:10.010
<v Speaker 5>we found a nearby,</v>

3068
01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:11.413
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3069
01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:16.660
<v Speaker 5>construction companies that are specialists in ornamental casting of concrete.</v>

3070
01:28:18.050 --> 01:28:18.910
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

3071
01:28:18.911 --> 01:28:23.911
<v Speaker 5>so this is led to this kind of a key to how we're going to actually build the</v>

3072
01:28:25.071 --> 01:28:25.491
<v Speaker 5>building.</v>

3073
01:28:25.491 --> 01:28:26.870
<v Speaker 5>So that's all going to be concrete.</v>

3074
01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:27.651
<v Speaker 5>Those faces.</v>

3075
01:28:27.651 --> 01:28:28.220
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

3076
01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:33.220
<v Speaker 5>but it's a skin I thin skin of concrete about an inch thick and uh,</v>

3077
01:28:33.770 --> 01:28:38.330
<v Speaker 5>reinforced with steel and a class fiber reinforced kind of concrete.</v>

3078
01:28:38.331 --> 01:28:39.560
<v Speaker 5>And it's a very special,</v>

3079
01:28:39.710 --> 01:28:40.160
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3080
01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:40.910
<v Speaker 5>kind of,</v>

3081
01:28:40.910 --> 01:28:41.743
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3082
01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:42.530
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3083
01:28:42.530 --> 01:28:43.363
<v Speaker 5>permanent.</v>

3084
01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:43.820
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3085
01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:47.390
<v Speaker 5>and then it's going to be sectioned and,</v>

3086
01:28:47.391 --> 01:28:47.540
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3087
01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:48.380
<v Speaker 5>like these heads,</v>

3088
01:28:48.410 --> 01:28:51.170
<v Speaker 5>there's very repetitive kinds of elements to it.</v>

3089
01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:54.770
<v Speaker 5>So there'll be made on some sort of a gigantic mold or something like that.</v>

3090
01:28:54.771 --> 01:28:56.170
<v Speaker 5>And there'll be several of them reversed.</v>

3091
01:28:56.171 --> 01:28:57.590
<v Speaker 5>It will be a first,</v>

3092
01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:58.513
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

3093
01:28:58.550 --> 01:28:59.383
<v Speaker 5>I guess,</v>

3094
01:28:59.420 --> 01:29:01.130
<v Speaker 5>seeing in the imagination.</v>

3095
01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:01.500
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3096

3098
01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:07.410
<v Speaker 5>And then I drew it and,</v>

3099
01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:07.800
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3100
01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:10.560
<v Speaker 5>then I showed it to Ryan toddle,</v>

3101

3104
01:29:17.821 --> 01:29:18.420
<v Speaker 5>the day.</v>

3105
01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:19.140
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

3106
01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:19.381

<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3109
01:29:22.230 --> 01:29:24.420
<v Speaker 5>into three dimensions and,</v>

3110
01:29:24.490 --> 01:29:24.740
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3111
01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:29.740
<v Speaker 5>made the actual three d model that's sized perfectly to the building.</v>

3112
01:29:31.410 --> 01:29:35.520
<v Speaker 5>So this will be printed out in sections and,</v>

3113
01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:35.821
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3119
01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:44.340
<v Speaker 5>And then a mold will be taken from that.</v>

3120
01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:45.480
<v Speaker 5>Then,</v>

3121

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:58.770
<v Speaker 5>It's got pins on the back that attached to a steel armature and that armature</v>

3131
01:29:58.771 --> 01:30:00.030
<v Speaker 5>attaches to the building.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Well we covered,</v>

3210
01:31:48.990 --> 01:31:50.010
<v Speaker 5>we try to have,</v>

3211
01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:50.760
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>that just so that things don't always stay cool.</v>

3217
01:31:58.990 --> 01:31:59.830
<v Speaker 5>You know what it would be though,</v>

3218
01:31:59.831 --> 01:32:04.750
<v Speaker 5>it'd be the cop that pretended to be one of you guys that would freak out and</v>

3219
01:32:04.751 --> 01:32:05.584
<v Speaker 5>pull his gun.</v>

3220
01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:09.460
<v Speaker 5>The real cops will come in and lock you guys down because you're a violent yet</v>

3221
01:32:09.461 --> 01:32:10.294
<v Speaker 5>guns.</v>

3222
01:32:10.330 --> 01:32:12.010
<v Speaker 5>That'd be what I would do if I was a cop.</v>

3223
01:32:12.011 --> 01:32:13.390
<v Speaker 5>So I was trying to shut you hippies down.</v>

3224
01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:13.991
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3225
01:32:13.991 --> 01:32:18.991
<v Speaker 5>we actually have made friends with the local police because,</v>

3226
01:32:19.250 --> 01:32:19.780
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3227
01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:20.770
<v Speaker 5>we're grateful.</v>

3228
01:32:20.810 --> 01:32:20.871
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3229
01:32:20.871 --> 01:32:21.310
<v Speaker 5>that's how,</v>

01:32:21.310 --> 01:32:22.660
<v Speaker 5>for their service,</v>

3231
01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:25.240
<v Speaker 5>and that's a beautiful thing to say too.</v>

3232
01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:26.590
<v Speaker 5>I agree with that as well.</v>

3233
01:32:26.591 --> 01:32:30.340
<v Speaker 5>I get shit about that online because you always to tell people that I like cops.</v>

3234
01:32:30.341 --> 01:32:32.170
<v Speaker 5>But I think it's important to have police.</v>

3235
01:32:33.090 --> 01:32:35.710
<v Speaker 5>We absolutely depend on them.</v>

3236
01:32:35.711 --> 01:32:36.910
<v Speaker 5>AIESEC community.</v>

3237
01:32:36.970 --> 01:32:41.170
<v Speaker 5>And there's a lot of good ones you that people don't want to address that.</v>

3238
01:32:41.171 --> 01:32:42.250
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of cops out there.</v>

3239
01:32:42.251 --> 01:32:44.990
<v Speaker 5>They're nice despite all the shit they see every day.</v>

3240
01:32:45.230 --> 01:32:45.700
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

3241
01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:50.700
<v Speaker 5>we have a friends who were sort of high up in that and the local region and,</v>

3242
01:32:51.770 --> 01:32:56.230
<v Speaker 5>and they're just some of the nicest people and most compassionate actually</v>

3243
01:32:56.231 --> 01:33:00.820
<v Speaker 5>because there they go to people who are in trouble mostly.</v>

3244
01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:01.151
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

3245
01:33:01.151 --> 01:33:01.331
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3246
01:33:01.331 --> 01:33:02.710
<v Speaker 5>there absolutely are bad cops.</v>

3247
01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:04.150
<v Speaker 5>That's no doubt about it either.</v>

3248
01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:05.013
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

3249
01:33:05.470 --> 01:33:07.420
<v Speaker 5>No one's making up for that.</v>

3250
01:33:07.450 --> 01:33:09.170
<v Speaker 5>But just saying there's,</v>

3251
01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:10.960
<v Speaker 5>there's a need for it and a lot of them are good.</v>

3252
01:33:10.961 --> 01:33:13.760
<v Speaker 5>And if you're in a community that's accepting you guys and,</v>

3253
01:33:13.761 --> 01:33:16.750
<v Speaker 5>and did you have a little weird thing where they didn't want you guys to be non</v>

3254
01:33:16.751 --> 01:33:17.584
<v Speaker 5>taxed?</v>

3255

<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3258
01:33:20.380 --> 01:33:22.020
<v Speaker 5>they won't accept you as a regular religion.</v>

3259
01:33:22.510 --> 01:33:23.890
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>

3277
01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:01.210
<v Speaker 5>and so now we've got a loan from a bank that is,</v>

3278
01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:02.130

3286
01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:12.350
<v Speaker 5>What kind of town is this?</v>

3287
01:34:12.351 --> 01:34:14.500
<v Speaker 5>This is like a town that accepts hippies.</v>

3288
01:34:14.930 --> 01:34:16.980
<v Speaker 5>They conserve that.</v>

3289
01:34:17.010 --> 01:34:18.970
<v Speaker 5>I'd say there's,</v>

3290
01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:21.220
<v Speaker 5>I'd say there's a healthy mix.</v>

3291
01:34:21.610 --> 01:34:23.320
<v Speaker 5>And what I find so,</v>

3292
01:34:23.410 --> 01:34:24.243
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3293
01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:27.490
<v Speaker 5>really astonishing is the religious diversity.</v>

3294
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:28.480
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3295
01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:29.020
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

3296
01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:29.330
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3297
01:34:29.330 --> 01:34:30.140
<v Speaker 5>seek,</v>

3298
01:34:30.140 --> 01:34:30.660
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3299
01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:31.420
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3300
01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:32.021
<v Speaker 5>temple,</v>

3301
01:34:32.021 --> 01:34:34.150
<v Speaker 5>I believe there's Hindu temples,</v>

3302
01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:37.030
<v Speaker 5>there's a Tibetan Buddhist Stupa,</v>

3303
01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:39.820
<v Speaker 5>there's all in the town.</v>

3304
01:34:39.850 --> 01:34:40.840
<v Speaker 5>How many people were in his tone?</v>

3305
01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:41.231
<v Speaker 5>Just,</v>

3306
01:34:41.231 --> 01:34:41.650
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3307
01:34:41.650 --> 01:34:42.340
<v Speaker 5>it's not,</v>

3308
01:34:42.340 --> 01:34:44.070
<v Speaker 5>it's not a large amount of taste.</v>

3309
01:34:44.130 --> 01:34:45.220
<v Speaker 5>One of those vortexes,</v>

3310
01:34:45.250 --> 01:34:46.620
<v Speaker 5>they're just a little wrong.</v>

3311
01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:48.100
<v Speaker 5>I think that the comedy store,</v>

3312
01:34:48.220 --> 01:34:50.230
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a little bit of a vortex.</v>

3313
01:34:50.231 --> 01:34:51.700
<v Speaker 5>Just beauty and,</v>

3314
01:34:51.701 --> 01:34:52.420
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3315
01:34:52.420 --> 01:34:53.030
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3316
01:34:53.030 --> 01:34:53.241
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3317
01:34:53.241 --> 01:34:55.810
<v Speaker 5>according to our native American scholar,</v>

3318
01:34:55.930 --> 01:34:56.261
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3319
01:34:56.261 --> 01:34:57.080
<v Speaker 5>Evan Pritchard,</v>

3320
01:34:57.080 --> 01:34:58.340
<v Speaker 5>he said that the,</v>

3321
01:34:58.400 --> 01:34:59.233
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3322
01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:03.980
<v Speaker 5>our land may have been held sacred by the [inaudible] people as well.</v>

3323
01:35:04.250 --> 01:35:06.290
<v Speaker 5>So it's always been kind of in this,</v>

3324
01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:07.183
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3325

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3326
01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:11.200
<v Speaker 5>sacred tradition and it was a church before you and yeah,</v>

3327
01:35:11.570 --> 01:35:12.470
<v Speaker 5>that's fascinating.</v>

3328
01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:13.700
<v Speaker 5>I always wondered why,</v>

3329
01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:14.533
<v Speaker 5>where are they,</v>

3330

01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:18.950
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3334
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:20.960
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really cool that you're doing it.</v>

3335
01:35:21.050 --> 01:35:22.130
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really fun.</v>

3336
01:35:22.190 --> 01:35:23.023
<v Speaker 1>It's exciting.</v>

3337
01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:24.560
<v Speaker 1>I know you have good intentions.</v>

3338
01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:25.190
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3339
01:35:25.190 --> 01:35:25.790

3607
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:11.870
<v Speaker 6>there's going to be so many people that are influenced by that.</v>

3608
01:42:11.930 --> 01:42:13.220
<v Speaker 6>There's so many people that look at that and go,</v>

3609
01:42:13.221 --> 01:42:13.521
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

3610

01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:15.013
<v Speaker 6>What's going on over there?</v>

3612
01:42:15.380 --> 01:42:17.150
<v Speaker 6>And they've got full moons.</v>

3613
01:42:17.300 --> 01:42:18.440
<v Speaker 6>What does it big deal about four months?</v>

3614
01:42:18.441 --> 01:42:19.274
<v Speaker 6>What did these people doing?</v>

3615
01:42:19.370 --> 01:42:19.641
<v Speaker 6>Wow,</v>

<v Speaker 6>what is this fucking building?</v>

3618
01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:23.120
<v Speaker 6>And then they get sucked.</v>

3619
01:42:23.121 --> 01:42:23.954
<v Speaker 6>Then.</v>

3620
01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:26.300
<v Speaker 6>Do you know you're doing that?</v>

3621
01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:29.180
<v Speaker 6>You're going to be comfortable as a cult leader or how's that?</v>

3622
01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:31.220
<v Speaker 5>That's at,</v>

3623
01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:32.230
<v Speaker 5>it's tough.</v>

3624
01:42:32.230 --> 01:42:33.550
<v Speaker 5>I think that's very tricky.</v>

3625
01:42:33.730 --> 01:42:34.690
<v Speaker 5>It's about,</v>

<v Speaker 5>as I said,</v>

3628
01:42:37.060 --> 01:42:39.700
<v Speaker 5>holding up a sacred mirror for people.</v>

3629
01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:41.290
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

3630
01:42:41.290 --> 01:42:42.123
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3631
01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:46.420
<v Speaker 5>if there's an element of inspiration in the,</v>

3632
01:42:46.570 --> 01:42:47.170
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3633

3641

<v Speaker 6>You see that start to spark transformation,</v>

3649
01:43:24.340 --> 01:43:25.173
<v Speaker 5>and that,</v>

<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3655
01:43:30.670 --> 01:43:35.200
<v Speaker 5>have a humanity that lives for hundreds of thousands of years instead of snuffs</v>

3656
01:43:35.201 --> 01:43:37.270
<v Speaker 5>itself out in a stupid,</v>

01:43:52.370 --> 01:43:52.820
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3673
01:43:52.820 --> 01:43:57.820
<v Speaker 5>I think it's the most exciting and amazing time cause it's like our Kickstarter,</v>

3674
01:43:58.941 --> 01:44:00.110
<v Speaker 5>I have a kind of a,</v>

3675

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3681
01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:06.020
<v Speaker 5>element.</v>

3682
01:44:06.020 --> 01:44:06.470
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3683
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.891
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

3684
01:44:06.891 --> 01:44:07.011
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3685
01:44:07.011 --> 01:44:07.844
<v Speaker 5>of course,</v>

3686
01:44:08.210 --> 01:44:11.900
<v Speaker 5>we haven't got a United world that,</v>

3687
01:44:12.050 --> 01:44:14.750
<v Speaker 5>that at where we say collectively,</v>

3688
01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:15.171
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3689
01:44:15.171 --> 01:44:16.004
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>

3690
01:44:16.340 --> 01:44:18.080
<v Speaker 5>that is too much carbon.</v>

3691
01:44:18.220 --> 01:44:18.590
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3692
01:44:18.590 --> 01:44:19.880
<v Speaker 5>let's do the sower.</v>

3693
01:44:19.881 --> 01:44:21.680
<v Speaker 5>Like really like hard,</v>

3694
01:44:21.860 --> 01:44:22.690
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3695
01:44:22.690 --> 01:44:23.890
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

3696
01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:27.650
<v Speaker 5>and so we can start to turn it around.</v>

3697
01:44:27.950 --> 01:44:28.783
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3698
01:44:29.210 --> 01:44:29.630
<v Speaker 5>we're not,</v>

3699
01:44:29.630 --> 01:44:30.770
<v Speaker 5>we're not there yet,</v>

3700
01:44:30.860 --> 01:44:33.710
<v Speaker 5>but people in general I think,</v>

3701
01:44:33.740 --> 01:44:34.573
<v Speaker 5>feel that,</v>

3702
01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:35.450
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3703
01:44:35.450 --> 01:44:37.220
<v Speaker 5>and they start to feel like the,</v>

3704
01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:38.270
<v Speaker 5>Oh wow,</v>

3705
01:44:38.330 --> 01:44:39.920
<v Speaker 5>how can we turn it around?</v>

3706
01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:41.150
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

3707
01:44:41.150 --> 01:44:41.451
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3708
01:44:41.451 --> 01:44:43.580
<v Speaker 5>so that's why I think that,</v>

3709
01:44:43.670 --> 01:44:44.150
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3710
01:44:44.150 --> 01:44:49.150
<v Speaker 5>people like Paul Stamets and other visionary thinkers who understand more about</v>

3711
01:44:53.481 --> 01:44:54.090
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3712
01:44:54.090 --> 01:44:54.500
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3713
01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:56.450
<v Speaker 5>intricacies and intelligence of,</v>

3714
01:44:56.860 --> 01:44:57.110
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3715
01:44:57.110 --> 01:44:58.130
<v Speaker 5>say the fungus,</v>

3716
01:44:58.680 --> 01:44:59.513
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3717
01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:00.080
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

3718
01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:00.870
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3719
01:45:00.870 --> 01:45:01.130
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3720
01:45:01.130 --> 01:45:03.650
<v Speaker 5>we have a lot to be hopeful about.</v>

3721
01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:04.820
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

3722
01:45:04.820 --> 01:45:05.270
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3723
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:10.270
<v Speaker 5>if we put to use the technology and the intelligence that is already available,</v>

3724
01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:13.820
<v Speaker 5>you need to start a farm too.</v>

3725
01:45:13.930 --> 01:45:15.320
<v Speaker 5>You'd grow your own food out there.</v>

3726
01:45:15.380 --> 01:45:16.020
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

3727
01:45:16.020 --> 01:45:16.441
<v Speaker 6>Why not?</v>

3728
01:45:16.441 --> 01:45:17.460
<v Speaker 6>You've got 40 acres,</v>

3729
01:45:17.461 --> 01:45:17.790
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3730
01:45:17.790 --> 01:45:18.541
<v Speaker 6>It's a great area.</v>

3731
01:45:18.541 --> 01:45:19.740
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure it gets a lot of rain.</v>

3732
01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:20.281
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3733
01:45:20.281 --> 01:45:24.060
<v Speaker 6>we're right next door to a great field and perhaps</v>

3734
01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:25.760
<v Speaker 5>it's an organic farm coming in.</v>

3735
01:45:25.970 --> 01:45:28.790
<v Speaker 5>So right now we're focusing on the temple,</v>

3736
01:45:29.060 --> 01:45:29.900
<v Speaker 5>but we,</v>

3737
01:45:29.930 --> 01:45:32.030
<v Speaker 5>all those things are part of the,</v>

3738
01:45:32.210 --> 01:45:32.540
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3739
01:45:32.540 --> 01:45:34.760
<v Speaker 5>I think overall permaculture plan,</v>

3740
01:45:35.150 --> 01:45:37.220
<v Speaker 5>we're still mapping the land to see,</v>

3741
01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:37.960
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3742
01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:38.793
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3743
01:45:38.930 --> 01:45:41.750
<v Speaker 5>permit culturally what would make sense to develop.</v>

3744
01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:44.560
<v Speaker 6>That's going to be really fascinating and when it's done,</v>

3745
01:45:44.561 --> 01:45:44.771
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

3746
01:45:44.771 --> 01:45:46.390
<v Speaker 6>I really can't wait and I'm,</v>

3747
01:45:46.610 --> 01:45:48.010
<v Speaker 6>I'm really excited about it.</v>

3748
01:45:48.220 --> 01:45:53.220
<v Speaker 6>But just goes to show you the negative thinking that some people just can't</v>

3749
01:45:53.861 --> 01:45:54.430
<v Speaker 6>escape.</v>

3750
01:45:54.430 --> 01:45:56.520
<v Speaker 6>Some people just can't help being negative no matter what.</v>

3751
01:45:56.521 --> 01:45:58.330
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to how positive someone else's messages.</v>

3752
01:45:58.570 --> 01:45:59.800
<v Speaker 6>Some people can't help being negative.</v>

3753
01:46:00.100 --> 01:46:03.700
<v Speaker 6>Somebody talked about your empathy and at the end that's what we're going to be</v>

3754
01:46:03.701 --> 01:46:03.911
<v Speaker 6>on.</v>

3755
01:46:03.911 --> 01:46:04.720
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3756
01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:05.660
<v Speaker 6>they said it was a,</v>

3757
01:46:05.661 --> 01:46:10.330
<v Speaker 6>a shrine to your ego because you're creating a big piece of art,</v>

3758
01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:13.150
<v Speaker 6>big piece of beautiful art that somehow our shrine to your ego.</v>

3759
01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:17.140
<v Speaker 6>She's not a strange thing that people will accept art.</v>

3760
01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:22.440
<v Speaker 6>But if that art becomes a building that's then something's ego about it.</v>

3761
01:46:23.500 --> 01:46:28.240
<v Speaker 6>Like it can be the most beautiful thing as long as it's a painting or a</v>

3762
01:46:28.241 --> 01:46:29.074
<v Speaker 6>sculpture.</v>

3763
01:46:29.170 --> 01:46:30.760
<v Speaker 6>But when you make a house out of it,</v>

3764
01:46:31.390 --> 01:46:32.890
<v Speaker 6>then it's a shrine.</v>

3765
01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:34.750
<v Speaker 6>And it was a shrine to ego.</v>

3766
01:46:34.900 --> 01:46:38.000
<v Speaker 6>Like it can't just be a beautiful piece of art sculpture.</v>

3767
01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:40.150
<v Speaker 6>Why does someone have to hate like that?</v>

3768
01:46:40.151 --> 01:46:40.720
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>

3769
01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:42.430
<v Speaker 6>that's gotta be the way you were raised.</v>

3770
01:46:42.431 --> 01:46:43.930
<v Speaker 6>It's gotta be the people that you're around.</v>

3771
01:46:43.931 --> 01:46:45.400
<v Speaker 6>There's no other way.</v>

3772
01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:47.710
<v Speaker 6>That kind of douchey thinking should be accepted.</v>

3773
01:46:48.900 --> 01:46:49.630
<v Speaker 3>Hey look,</v>

3774
01:46:49.630 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3775
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:52.050
<v Speaker 3>everybody's entitled to their reaction.</v>

3776
01:46:52.051 --> 01:46:57.051
<v Speaker 3>And I think that it's inevitable that entitled to be mocked for their reaction.</v>

3777
01:47:01.050 --> 01:47:03.660
<v Speaker 3>People need to feel the sting of other people going,</v>

3787
01:47:14.570 --> 01:47:15.330
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>

3788
01:47:15.330 --> 01:47:16.320
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people didn't get them.</v>

3789
01:47:16.350 --> 01:47:17.490
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people need them now.</v>

3790
01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:18.211
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3791
01:47:18.211 --> 01:47:18.560
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3792
01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:19.920
<v Speaker 3>they're very ideas.</v>

3793
01:47:19.950 --> 01:47:21.720
<v Speaker 3>The idea that there is,</v>

3794
01:47:21.810 --> 01:47:22.643
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3795
01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:23.970
<v Speaker 3>basically one,</v>

3796
01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:27.840
<v Speaker 3>one face of God and it's all of us.</v>

3797
01:47:28.350 --> 01:47:29.070
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3798
01:47:29.070 --> 01:47:30.030
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

3799
01:47:30.150 --> 01:47:30.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3800
01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:31.553
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

3801
01:47:31.620 --> 01:47:36.620
<v Speaker 3>there's a multiple and then there's a one on the top of the roof.</v>

3802
01:47:36.990 --> 01:47:39.720
<v Speaker 3>So you got the one and the many and the many and the one.</v>

3803
01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:41.910
<v Speaker 3>And through consciousness evolution,</v>

3804
01:47:41.911 --> 01:47:44.820
<v Speaker 3>you can reach both.</v>

3805
01:47:45.570 --> 01:47:46.020
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>

3806
01:47:46.020 --> 01:47:49.050
<v Speaker 3>I like that you say that and it doesn't sound goofy at all.</v>

3807
01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:51.270
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what I mean?</v>

3808
01:47:51.270 --> 01:47:51.450
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3809

<v Speaker 3>the plain facts as you're sincere.</v>

3811
01:47:55.550 --> 01:47:56.383
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3812
01:47:56.580 --> 01:47:57.890
<v Speaker 3>But it's one of those concepts where you,</v>

3813
01:47:57.891 --> 01:47:58.171
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3814
01:47:58.171 --> 01:48:01.300
<v Speaker 3>you start talking about the God is the one and the one of the Lord and you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3817
01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:07.260
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

3818
01:48:07.260 --> 01:48:09.450
<v Speaker 3>You take it from a scientific perspective,</v>

3819
01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:09.871
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3820
01:48:09.871 --> 01:48:12.660
<v Speaker 3>most are still on the big bang.</v>

3821
01:48:12.661 --> 01:48:12.931
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3822
01:48:12.931 --> 01:48:15.540
<v Speaker 3>that 13.7 billion years ago,</v>

3823
01:48:15.541 --> 01:48:16.500
<v Speaker 3>there was nothing.</v>

3824
01:48:16.590 --> 01:48:20.940
<v Speaker 3>And then [inaudible] 13.7 billion years ago,</v>

3825
01:48:20.941 --> 01:48:21.960
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about it.</v>

3826
01:48:21.980 --> 01:48:22.620
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3827
01:48:22.620 --> 01:48:25.830
<v Speaker 3>And so that was a lot of evolution.</v>

3828
01:48:26.070 --> 01:48:29.550
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of development over a long period of time.</v>

3829
01:48:30.180 --> 01:48:30.780
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3830
01:48:30.780 --> 01:48:31.440
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

3831
01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:31.830
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

3832
01:48:31.830 --> 01:48:32.160
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3833
01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:37.160
<v Speaker 3>inherently the creative spirit brought us here and uh,</v>

3834
01:48:37.950 --> 01:48:38.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3835
01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:38.790
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3836
01:48:38.790 --> 01:48:40.310
<v Speaker 3>consciousness itself is,</v>

3837
01:48:40.370 --> 01:48:43.020
<v Speaker 3>is a miracle that we could understand each other.</v>

3838
01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:44.033
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating.</v>

3839
01:48:44.580 --> 01:48:45.540
<v Speaker 3>Beyond fascinating,</v>

3840
01:48:45.710 --> 01:48:46.500
<v Speaker 3>but knows,</v>

3841
01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:48.090
<v Speaker 3>I love that you were optimistic too.</v>

3842
01:48:48.450 --> 01:48:49.151
<v Speaker 3>Like you,</v>

3843
01:48:49.151 --> 01:48:51.270
<v Speaker 3>you have hope for the human race.</v>

3844
01:48:51.630 --> 01:48:56.630
<v Speaker 3>Like I think there's no reason to be anything but because despite all the crazy</v>

3845
01:48:57.751 --> 01:49:00.870
<v Speaker 3>shit that's in the world of million nuclear weapons that can destroy every</v>

3846
01:49:00.871 --> 01:49:01.704
<v Speaker 3>single thing,</v>

3847
01:49:01.740 --> 01:49:02.573
<v Speaker 3>we haven't done it yet.</v>

3848
01:49:02.820 --> 01:49:03.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3849
01:49:03.300 --> 01:49:04.140
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of amazing.</v>

3850
01:49:04.410 --> 01:49:08.130
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of amazing that we've done as little pollution as we actually have.</v>

3851
01:49:08.490 --> 01:49:08.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3852
01:49:08.910 --> 01:49:13.470
<v Speaker 3>it's really quite shocking that we actually toned it down there.</v>

3853
01:49:13.650 --> 01:49:14.970
<v Speaker 3>That's a little bit of like,</v>

3854
01:49:14.971 --> 01:49:15.481
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3855
01:49:15.481 --> 01:49:16.314
<v Speaker 3>everybody settled down.</v>

3856
01:49:16.470 --> 01:49:16.681
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3857
01:49:16.681 --> 01:49:18.260
<v Speaker 3>like apparently the,</v>

3858
01:49:18.510 --> 01:49:21.240
<v Speaker 3>the pollution was much worse in Los Angeles,</v>

3859
01:49:21.390 --> 01:49:21.901
<v Speaker 3>like in the,</v>

3860
01:49:21.901 --> 01:49:23.910
<v Speaker 3>in the 60s and the 70s.</v>

3861
01:49:24.070 --> 01:49:26.880
<v Speaker 3>They said it was horrible because they have those led cars.</v>

3862
01:49:26.900 --> 01:49:29.850
<v Speaker 3>Like the gas was totally different and they'd cleaned that up a lot.</v>

3863
01:49:29.851 --> 01:49:29.971
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3864
01:49:29.971 --> 01:49:30.241
<v Speaker 3>it's still,</v>

3865
01:49:30.241 --> 01:49:31.074
<v Speaker 3>looks like shit.</v>

3866

<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>

3871
01:49:38.250 --> 01:49:41.730
<v Speaker 3>that's a symbol or the stage of evolution.</v>

3872
01:49:41.731 --> 01:49:42.181
<v Speaker 3>A bit of it.</v>

3873

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3874

<v Speaker 3>a little bit.</v>

3875
01:49:43.350 --> 01:49:44.290
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>

3876
01:49:44.330 --> 01:49:47.470
<v Speaker 3>the consciousness that was born during the 60s,</v>

3877
01:49:47.660 --> 01:49:48.493
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3878

<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3923
01:50:47.620 --> 01:50:50.140
<v Speaker 5>to this society even benefit to it.</v>

3924
01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:51.161
<v Speaker 5>Likewise,</v>

3925
01:50:51.161 --> 01:50:53.440
<v Speaker 5>the cannabis user eventually,</v>

3926
01:50:53.590 --> 01:50:54.101
<v Speaker 5>I believe,</v>

3927
01:50:54.101 --> 01:50:58.570
<v Speaker 5>should be reintegrated into society and the world.</v>

3928
01:50:58.630 --> 01:51:01.570
<v Speaker 5>And this will show also an evolutionary step.</v>

3929
01:51:02.170 --> 01:51:03.003
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3930
01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:03.993
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3931
01:51:04.130 --> 01:51:04.963
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3932
01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:05.741
<v Speaker 5>because,</v>

3933
01:51:05.741 --> 01:51:05.921
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3934
01:51:05.921 --> 01:51:06.880
<v Speaker 5>this is the,</v>

3935
01:51:06.940 --> 01:51:07.773
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3936
01:51:08.140 --> 01:51:10.330
<v Speaker 5>the recognition of the divinity of nature.</v>

3937
01:51:11.600 --> 01:51:15.320
<v Speaker 6>I think there's every reason to be optimistic and although there are some really</v>

3938
01:51:15.321 --> 01:51:16.790
<v Speaker 6>bad things about the world today,</v>

3939
01:51:17.900 --> 01:51:22.370
<v Speaker 6>financial system is crazy and corrupt and it's too easy to manipulate and</v>

3940
01:51:22.371 --> 01:51:26.960
<v Speaker 6>everybody knows it's rigged and we still have to use it and it's still the thing</v>

3941
01:51:26.961 --> 01:51:31.961
<v Speaker 6>that pays off lobbyists and moves decisions that favorite corporations instead</v>

3942
01:51:32.931 --> 01:51:33.890
<v Speaker 6>of the general public.</v>

3943
01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:35.670
<v Speaker 6>We still know that there's,</v>

3944
01:51:35.690 --> 01:51:37.370
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot wrong with the world,</v>

3945
01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:42.110
<v Speaker 6>but we're learning more about humans,</v>

3946
01:51:42.380 --> 01:51:43.730
<v Speaker 6>about behavior,</v>

3947
01:51:43.731 --> 01:51:45.950
<v Speaker 6>about just information itself,</v>

3948
01:51:46.130 --> 01:51:47.360
<v Speaker 6>about technology,</v>

3949
01:51:47.361 --> 01:51:49.250
<v Speaker 6>about our place in the universe.</v>

3950
01:51:49.490 --> 01:51:53.420
<v Speaker 6>We're learning more about the cosmos every day there's like some new discovery,</v>

3951
01:51:53.421 --> 01:51:57.470
<v Speaker 6>a new thing and new this and new that and it's just coming at us like like a</v>

3952
01:51:57.471 --> 01:52:00.260
<v Speaker 6>wave wave after wave of information.</v>

3953
01:52:00.590 --> 01:52:05.060
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's possible to avoid all of that without some gigantic monsters.</v>

3954
01:52:05.061 --> 01:52:05.781
<v Speaker 6>Catastrophe.</v>

3955
01:52:05.781 --> 01:52:07.520
<v Speaker 6>I think if you just look at the,</v>

3956
01:52:07.970 --> 01:52:12.970
<v Speaker 6>if you were looking at a graph and you look at the head space of the American</v>

3957
01:52:12.981 --> 01:52:13.371
<v Speaker 6>person,</v>

3958
01:52:13.371 --> 01:52:18.371
<v Speaker 6>the average American person from 1960 and look at the headspace in 2013 where</v>

3959
01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:23.950
<v Speaker 6>was you're dealing with a completely different educated individual.</v>

3960
01:52:24.660 --> 01:52:28.850
<v Speaker 6>You are dealing with a level of understanding about the way the world works.</v>

3961
01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:33.170
<v Speaker 6>That's very different from at any other time because almost any question that</v>

3962
01:52:33.171 --> 01:52:36.770
<v Speaker 6>you've ever had can be answered on your phone within a matter of seconds.</v>

3963
01:52:37.250 --> 01:52:39.470
<v Speaker 6>And although that seems so normal,</v>

3964
01:52:39.650 --> 01:52:41.360
<v Speaker 6>that changed the whole world.</v>

3965
01:52:42.390 --> 01:52:44.480
<v Speaker 6>And that's going on right now.</v>

3966
01:52:45.330 --> 01:52:47.510
<v Speaker 6>I think it snuck up on us so fast.</v>

3967
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:51.170
<v Speaker 6>We just get so used to watching movies on our phone that we don't even think</v>

3968
01:52:51.171 --> 01:52:55.400
<v Speaker 6>it's weird that it's just coming through the air into this little thin wafer</v>

3969
01:52:55.401 --> 01:52:57.920
<v Speaker 6>thing that's made out of glass and metal in your pocket,</v>

3970
01:52:57.921 --> 01:53:02.921
<v Speaker 6>that you get to watch movies flying through the air and you don't even think</v>

3971
01:53:03.111 --> 01:53:03.441
<v Speaker 6>about,</v>

3972
01:53:03.441 --> 01:53:06.800
<v Speaker 6>it just seems so normal to you and it's all psychedelic.</v>

3973
01:53:07.160 --> 01:53:08.870
<v Speaker 5>It's very much so,</v>

3974
01:53:08.930 --> 01:53:09.590
<v Speaker 5>and that's,</v>

3975
01:53:09.590 --> 01:53:10.281
<v Speaker 5>that's what,</v>

3976
01:53:10.281 --> 01:53:11.000
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3977
01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:11.833
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3978
01:53:12.140 --> 01:53:12.741
<v Speaker 5>I guess,</v>

3979
01:53:12.741 --> 01:53:13.340
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3980
01:53:13.340 --> 01:53:17.600
<v Speaker 5>Steve Jobs had to be interviewed by the Department of Defense and he had to</v>

3981
01:53:17.601 --> 01:53:22.601
<v Speaker 5>defend his taking of psychedelics and he said it's a,</v>

3982
01:53:22.730 --> 01:53:23.420
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3983
01:53:23.420 --> 01:53:26.660
<v Speaker 5>In order to get the highest clearance at and things.</v>

3984
01:53:26.661 --> 01:53:29.750
<v Speaker 5>So as a part of his interview,</v>

3985
01:53:29.751 --> 01:53:33.890
<v Speaker 5>he said that he still believed that it was,</v>

3986
01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:34.773
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3987
01:53:34.790 --> 01:53:38.930
<v Speaker 5>one of the most important events in his life and,</v>

3988
01:53:39.020 --> 01:53:39.650
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3989
01:53:39.650 --> 01:53:40.483
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

3990
01:53:40.490 --> 01:53:40.790
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3991
01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:42.530
<v Speaker 5>his psychedelic experiences.</v>

3992
01:53:42.890 --> 01:53:43.311
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

3993
01:53:43.311 --> 01:53:43.610
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3994
01:53:43.610 --> 01:53:45.950
<v Speaker 5>many of the people that they worked with,</v>

3995
01:53:46.190 --> 01:53:46.970
<v Speaker 5>of course,</v>

3996
01:53:46.970 --> 01:53:47.750
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3997
01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:52.750
<v Speaker 5>they wondered how many times they had tripped and things and how far out are</v>

3998
01:53:53.271 --> 01:53:54.104
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

3999
01:53:54.170 --> 01:53:54.860
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4000
01:53:54.860 --> 01:53:55.281
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

4001
01:53:55.281 --> 01:53:55.510
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4002
01:53:55.510 --> 01:53:56.010
<v Speaker 5>was,</v>

4003
01:53:56.010 --> 01:53:56.290
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4004
01:53:56.290 --> 01:54:01.250
<v Speaker 5>part of the openness to a new ways of thinking that,</v>

4005
01:54:01.310 --> 01:54:01.610
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4006
01:54:01.610 --> 01:54:04.430
<v Speaker 5>it allowed just as you were saying that,</v>

4007
01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:04.790
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4008
01:54:04.790 --> 01:54:05.360
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

4009
01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:07.160
<v Speaker 5>after a psychedelic experience,</v>

4010
01:54:07.161 --> 01:54:11.030
<v Speaker 5>you have this folder that's called my old bullshit.</v>

4011
01:54:11.210 --> 01:54:14.960
<v Speaker 5>And then you have this possibility wide open in front of you.</v>

4012
01:54:14.961 --> 01:54:15.410
<v Speaker 5>Why,</v>

4013
01:54:15.410 --> 01:54:16.191
<v Speaker 5>my goodness,</v>

4014
01:54:16.191 --> 01:54:17.024
<v Speaker 5>a full new,</v>

4015
01:54:17.480 --> 01:54:19.190
<v Speaker 5>a new possibility there.</v>

4016
01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:20.121
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

4017
01:54:20.121 --> 01:54:25.121
<v Speaker 5>you can jump back in the bag that you already know or you can forge ahead into a</v>

4018
01:54:26.181 --> 01:54:27.770
<v Speaker 5>new territory.</v>

4019
01:54:28.100 --> 01:54:32.270
<v Speaker 5>And so that's the evolutionary edge and you're always pushing it.</v>

4020
01:54:32.330 --> 01:54:35.270
<v Speaker 5>And artists and creative people are always pushing it.</v>

4021
01:54:35.271 --> 01:54:40.220
<v Speaker 5>And that's why I say everybody's kind of pushing that edge in some way and,</v>

4022
01:54:40.250 --> 01:54:43.550
<v Speaker 5>and is inherently that,</v>

4023
01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:44.993
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4024
01:54:45.250 --> 01:54:46.190
<v Speaker 5>awareness.</v>

4025
01:54:47.190 --> 01:54:47.510
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4026
01:54:47.510 --> 01:54:52.510
<v Speaker 6>I think it's unavoidable and it's almost that a biologically we couldn't keep up</v>

4027
01:54:53.521 --> 01:54:55.530
<v Speaker 6>with all the technological evolution,</v>

4028
01:54:55.531 --> 01:54:59.300
<v Speaker 6>although it's not the correct term to use technological evolution.</v>

4029
01:54:59.310 --> 01:55:00.690
<v Speaker 6>They want to use it biologically.</v>

4030
01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:02.100
<v Speaker 6>But that just,</v>

4031
01:55:02.101 --> 01:55:02.970
<v Speaker 6>that alone,</v>

4032
01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:07.620
<v Speaker 6>it's almost like our access to information is too great for our feeble minds to</v>

4033
01:55:07.621 --> 01:55:08.454
<v Speaker 6>process.</v>

4034
01:55:08.580 --> 01:55:09.480
<v Speaker 6>We're still on some,</v>

4035
01:55:09.660 --> 01:55:09.931
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4036
01:55:09.931 --> 01:55:12.150
<v Speaker 6>old school pentium Celeron remember them?</v>

4037
01:55:12.170 --> 01:55:14.730
<v Speaker 6>Celeron one cries good as a pentium two.</v>

4038
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:15.421
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4039
01:55:15.421 --> 01:55:18.330
<v Speaker 6>I mean we're like on an old machine and machine sucks.</v>

4040
01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:20.010
<v Speaker 6>We have Dunbar's number.</v>

4041
01:55:20.011 --> 01:55:22.980
<v Speaker 6>We can't remember more than 150 people we fuck up.</v>

4042
01:55:22.981 --> 01:55:25.320
<v Speaker 6>Can't remember phone numbers anymore because you don't have to remember them</v>

4043
01:55:25.321 --> 01:55:26.160
<v Speaker 6>because they're on your phone,</v>

4044
01:55:26.530 --> 01:55:26.811
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

4045
01:55:26.811 --> 01:55:28.020
<v Speaker 6>So in that sense,</v>

4046
01:55:28.260 --> 01:55:30.810
<v Speaker 6>it's like we're almost becoming much,</v>

4047
01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:32.530
<v Speaker 6>it's almost like what the,</v>

4048
01:55:32.531 --> 01:55:34.590
<v Speaker 6>the technology is doing is setting us up.</v>

4049
01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:38.700
<v Speaker 6>It's getting us to a point where it's just overwhelming us with data that we</v>

4050
01:55:38.701 --> 01:55:39.690
<v Speaker 6>can't help that little bit.</v>

4051
01:55:39.990 --> 01:55:40.860
<v Speaker 6>I know you're having a problem.</v>

4052
01:55:41.070 --> 01:55:41.560
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

4053
01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:42.300
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to help you out.</v>

4054
01:55:42.300 --> 01:55:43.133
<v Speaker 6>We'll get to give you a,</v>

4055
01:55:43.230 --> 01:55:44.490
<v Speaker 6>we're going to put this chip in your brain,</v>

4056
01:55:44.670 --> 01:55:45.503
<v Speaker 6>and once you do,</v>

4057
01:55:45.750 --> 01:55:46.583
<v Speaker 6>boom,</v>

4058
01:55:46.770 --> 01:55:46.921
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4059
01:55:46.921 --> 01:55:48.330
<v Speaker 6>the governor knows where you are at all times,</v>

4060
01:55:48.331 --> 01:55:53.280
<v Speaker 6>but you have instant 120 Iq.</v>

4061
01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:55.860
<v Speaker 6>You're going to be able to see things you never saw before,</v>

4062
01:55:55.861 --> 01:55:57.600
<v Speaker 6>memorize things fairly quickly.</v>

4063
01:55:57.780 --> 01:55:59.130
<v Speaker 6>It's a total brain upgrade.</v>

4064
01:55:59.370 --> 01:56:01.500
<v Speaker 6>So little chip of gps in there,</v>

4065
01:56:01.501 --> 01:56:02.520
<v Speaker 6>and there's a kill switch,</v>

4066
01:56:03.890 --> 01:56:06.180
<v Speaker 6>a fucking electrocution bolt into your brain.</v>

4067
01:56:06.181 --> 01:56:07.740
<v Speaker 6>If you say anything bad about the government,</v>

4068
01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:10.980
<v Speaker 5>there's movies,</v>

4069
01:56:11.050 --> 01:56:11.540
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4070
01:56:11.540 --> 01:56:14.120
<v Speaker 5>being sort of made with that hypothesis.</v>

4071
01:56:14.121 --> 01:56:14.480
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4072
01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:15.110
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

4073
01:56:15.110 --> 01:56:15.943
<v Speaker 5>and the,</v>

4074
01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:17.960
<v Speaker 5>I always imagined the inf,</v>

4075
01:56:18.110 --> 01:56:18.500
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4076
01:56:18.500 --> 01:56:19.333
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4077
01:56:19.550 --> 01:56:19.911
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4078
01:56:19.911 --> 01:56:20.744
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4079
01:56:20.980 --> 01:56:21.500
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4080
01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:22.700
<v Speaker 5>interconnection,</v>

4081
01:56:22.850 --> 01:56:23.540
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4082

<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4085
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:30.200
<v Speaker 5>being the ability to control the net and the vision.</v>

4086
01:56:30.730 --> 01:56:34.780
<v Speaker 6>Do you think at all about the technological singularity?</v>

4087
01:56:34.781 --> 01:56:37.000
<v Speaker 6>Do you follow Kurtzweil and all that?</v>

4088
01:56:37.590 --> 01:56:38.320
<v Speaker 6>Singularity?</v>

4089
01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:38.440
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4090

<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4106
01:56:57.570 --> 01:57:01.260
<v Speaker 5>a robotic facsimile of Bina and,</v>

4107
01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:02.220
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4108

4110
01:57:06.081 --> 01:57:07.720
<v Speaker 5>I'm interviewing her for my Scifi show.</v>

4111
01:57:08.010 --> 01:57:08.760
<v Speaker 5>I have realized,</v>

4112

<v Speaker 5>four children.</v>

4125
01:57:24.690 --> 01:57:25.523
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 5>And yeah,</v>

4127
01:57:26.630 --> 01:57:26.950
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

4128
01:57:26.950 --> 01:57:27.783
<v Speaker 5>that's amazing.</v>

4129
01:57:28.110 --> 01:57:28.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4130
01:57:28.390 --> 01:57:32.230
<v Speaker 5>An artificial person or as close to it is what we have right now.</v>

4131
01:57:32.231 --> 01:57:32.440
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4132
01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:33.340
<v Speaker 5>Well and,</v>

4133
01:57:33.430 --> 01:57:34.900
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

4134
01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:38.560
<v Speaker 5>so I mean they're where the rubber meets the road.</v>

4135
01:57:38.561 --> 01:57:41.080
<v Speaker 5>They were really trying to push a program,</v>

4136
01:57:41.081 --> 01:57:44.860
<v Speaker 5>the robotics so that we can have a closer facsimile.</v>

4137
01:57:45.250 --> 01:57:46.061
<v Speaker 5>And of course,</v>

4138
01:57:46.061 --> 01:57:46.894
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4139
01:57:46.940 --> 01:57:47.773
<v Speaker 5>under style.</v>

4140
01:57:48.130 --> 01:57:48.640
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4141
01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:49.473
<v Speaker 5>the thing that,</v>

4142
01:57:49.680 --> 01:57:51.820
<v Speaker 5>that I found fascinating,</v>

4143
01:57:51.900 --> 01:57:52.220
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4144
01:57:52.220 --> 01:57:52.810
<v Speaker 5>cause I,</v>

4145
01:57:52.810 --> 01:57:57.790
<v Speaker 5>I was very resistant to the whole idea and I love with a robot idea.</v>

4146
01:57:58.150 --> 01:57:59.230
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4147
01:57:59.260 --> 01:58:01.210
<v Speaker 5>just the idea that the,</v>

4148
01:58:01.420 --> 01:58:01.900
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4149
01:58:01.900 --> 01:58:03.070
<v Speaker 5>that the,</v>

4150
01:58:03.540 --> 01:58:04.373
<v Speaker 5>mmm.</v>

4151
01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.280
<v Speaker 5>That there will be a time when you will,</v>

4152
01:58:07.460 --> 01:58:09.110
<v Speaker 5>when this will be a problem.</v>

4153
01:58:09.590 --> 01:58:10.010
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4154
01:58:10.010 --> 01:58:10.490
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

4155
01:58:10.490 --> 01:58:11.323
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4156
01:58:11.330 --> 01:58:16.330
<v Speaker 5>that you can not distinguish between a human being and a,</v>

4157
01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:18.330
<v Speaker 5>and a robot that's coming.</v>

4158
01:58:18.331 --> 01:58:19.164
<v Speaker 5>Don't you think?</v>

4159
01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:20.330
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure.</v>

4160
01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:21.261
<v Speaker 5>Perhaps,</v>

4161
01:58:21.261 --> 01:58:21.561
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4162
01:58:21.561 --> 01:58:23.600
<v Speaker 5>I'm naive to think that it isn't,</v>

4163
01:58:23.630 --> 01:58:24.090
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

4164
01:58:24.090 --> 01:58:24.420
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

4165
01:58:24.420 --> 01:58:26.600
<v Speaker 5>but I have this feeling and just like,</v>

4166
01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:27.200
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4167
01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:27.981
<v Speaker 5>people have,</v>

4168
01:58:27.981 --> 01:58:28.480
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4169
01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:29.840
<v Speaker 5>a gay Dar or,</v>

4170
01:58:29.841 --> 01:58:30.200
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4171
01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:30.591
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4172
01:58:30.591 --> 01:58:34.610
<v Speaker 5>know each who's Jewish and who's not and things like that,</v>

4173
01:58:35.060 --> 01:58:35.451
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4174
01:58:35.451 --> 01:58:36.560
<v Speaker 5>that eat that.</v>

4175
01:58:36.590 --> 01:58:37.700
<v Speaker 5>Having a,</v>

4176
01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:38.530
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4177
01:58:38.530 --> 01:58:39.141
<v Speaker 5>that's a pretty,</v>

4178
01:58:39.141 --> 01:58:41.680
<v Speaker 5>it's subtle and intangible things know,</v>

4179
01:58:42.270 --> 01:58:43.030
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4180
01:58:43.030 --> 01:58:45.130
<v Speaker 5>to say that all body armor,</v>

4181
01:58:45.190 --> 01:58:45.420
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4182
01:58:45.420 --> 01:58:46.440
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

4183
01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:47.020
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4184
01:58:47.020 --> 01:58:47.530
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

4185
01:58:47.530 --> 01:58:48.130
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4186
01:58:48.130 --> 01:58:48.910
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4187
01:58:48.910 --> 01:58:49.511
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4188
01:58:49.511 --> 01:58:53.680
<v Speaker 5>fact of your mechanical illness and inability,</v>

4189
01:58:53.860 --> 01:58:54.693
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4190
01:58:54.790 --> 01:58:55.331
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4191
01:58:55.331 --> 01:58:56.164
<v Speaker 5>to uh,</v>

4192
01:58:56.200 --> 01:59:01.200
<v Speaker 5>generate a subtle field even perhaps that's a heartbeat and a things,</v>

4193
01:59:02.740 --> 01:59:07.740
<v Speaker 5>these things are probably part of our unconscious awareness of a human being.</v>

4194
01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:11.380
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

4195
01:59:11.380 --> 01:59:11.740
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4196
01:59:11.740 --> 01:59:12.573
<v Speaker 5>I'll see,</v>

4197
01:59:12.790 --> 01:59:13.360
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4198
01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:13.661
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4199
01:59:13.661 --> 01:59:14.494
<v Speaker 5>as this,</v>

4200
01:59:14.530 --> 01:59:16.120
<v Speaker 5>as it develops,</v>

4201
01:59:16.270 --> 01:59:16.810
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4202
01:59:16.810 --> 01:59:20.680
<v Speaker 5>artificial intelligence and robotics and things and I'm sure they'll,</v>

4203
01:59:21.400 --> 01:59:23.400
<v Speaker 5>part of it will evolve toward them.</v>

4204
01:59:24.020 --> 01:59:29.020
<v Speaker 1>I really feel like we're not giving technology the credit it deserves in that I</v>

4205
01:59:29.031 --> 01:59:30.100
<v Speaker 1>think it might be a lot.</v>

4206
01:59:30.770 --> 01:59:35.240
<v Speaker 1>And I know that sounds completely ridiculous because we were so sure that life</v>

4207
01:59:35.241 --> 01:59:36.074
<v Speaker 1>is like us.</v>

4208
01:59:36.230 --> 01:59:41.230
<v Speaker 1>We're so sure that life has cells and has blood and you know at either consumes</v>

4209
01:59:42.351 --> 01:59:44.300
<v Speaker 1>oxygen or it could be plant based life,</v>

4210
01:59:44.301 --> 01:59:46.160
<v Speaker 1>but we know what life is and that's not life.</v>

4211
01:59:46.190 --> 01:59:46.311
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4212
01:59:46.311 --> 01:59:47.390
<v Speaker 1>that's just something we created.</v>

4213
01:59:47.780 --> 01:59:48.590
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

4214
01:59:48.590 --> 01:59:50.360
<v Speaker 1>because eventually when you turn it on,</v>

4215
01:59:50.690 --> 01:59:53.510
<v Speaker 1>if it eventually gets to the point where he could reproduce on its own and think</v>

4216
01:59:53.511 --> 01:59:57.590
<v Speaker 1>for itself and defends itself or knows how to stay alive or has instincts or</v>

4217
01:59:57.591 --> 01:59:58.850
<v Speaker 1>knows how to repair itself,</v>

4218
01:59:59.200 --> 02:00:00.620
<v Speaker 1>then what exactly is that?</v>

4219
02:00:01.030 --> 02:00:02.650
<v Speaker 1>And it wa how come it's not as,</v>

4220
02:00:02.651 --> 02:00:03.351
<v Speaker 1>it's not life.</v>

4221
02:00:03.351 --> 02:00:03.741
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

4222
02:00:03.741 --> 02:00:05.140
<v Speaker 1>Because it doesn't have what?</v>

4223
02:00:05.770 --> 02:00:06.980
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't have skin.</v>

4224
02:00:07.490 --> 02:00:08.030
<v Speaker 1>Is it not?</v>

4225
02:00:08.030 --> 02:00:12.050
<v Speaker 1>Like if it's reproducing and thinking and altering its environment and then</v>

4226
02:00:12.051 --> 02:00:15.920
<v Speaker 1>moving forward and creating new energy sources and figuring out how to better</v>

4227
02:00:15.921 --> 02:00:17.000
<v Speaker 1>use resources.</v>

4228
02:00:17.240 --> 02:00:21.410
<v Speaker 1>If you've becomes intelligent life and some crazy asshole says,</v>

4229
02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:21.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4230
02:00:21.741 --> 02:00:22.521
<v Speaker 1>and programs in,</v>

4231
02:00:22.521 --> 02:00:22.701
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

4232
02:00:22.701 --> 02:00:25.190
<v Speaker 1>defend yourself and reproduce as soon as you can.</v>

4233
02:00:25.730 --> 02:00:25.911
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4234
02:00:25.911 --> 02:00:26.720
<v Speaker 1>you're doomed.</v>

4235
02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:27.980
<v Speaker 1>The human race has done,</v>

4236
02:00:28.370 --> 02:00:28.940
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna.</v>

4237
02:00:28.940 --> 02:00:29.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4238
02:00:29.150 --> 02:00:30.440
<v Speaker 1>for sure that's a life form.</v>

4239
02:00:30.620 --> 02:00:30.741
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

4240
02:00:30.741 --> 02:00:34.310
<v Speaker 1>it can be a life form and you're going to get to the point,</v>

4241
02:00:34.460 --> 02:00:37.490
<v Speaker 1>if this woman is recreating her wife,</v>

4242
02:00:38.210 --> 02:00:40.700
<v Speaker 1>it's going to get to a point where that's going to be indistinguishable.</v>

4243
02:00:40.730 --> 02:00:42.440
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be an artificial,</v>

4244
02:00:42.441 --> 02:00:43.580
<v Speaker 1>you there,</v>

4245
02:00:43.610 --> 02:00:45.620
<v Speaker 1>it might even be an artificial you.</v>

4246
02:00:45.740 --> 02:00:47.180
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly you.</v>

4247
02:00:47.181 --> 02:00:49.370
<v Speaker 1>It's your consciousness in another body.</v>

4248
02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:51.800
<v Speaker 1>You might be able to live several lives at once.</v>

4249
02:00:52.100 --> 02:00:53.360
<v Speaker 1>Syncytia fuck one of them up.</v>

4250
02:00:53.361 --> 02:00:56.660
<v Speaker 1>You've got a bunch of other good lives going on simultaneously.</v>

4251
02:00:57.490 --> 02:01:00.240
<v Speaker 5>You did the right to Benton Buddhist practices.</v>

4252
02:01:00.241 --> 02:01:01.530
<v Speaker 5>I think you can do that.</v>

4253
02:01:01.531 --> 02:01:02.364
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>

<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4262
02:01:09.570 --> 02:01:11.730
<v Speaker 5>element of the virtual,</v>

4263
02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:12.540
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4264

<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4267
02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:19.200
<v Speaker 5>Martine and Bina talked about and they,</v>

4268
02:01:19.201 --> 02:01:19.410
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4269
02:01:19.410 --> 02:01:22.820
<v Speaker 5>Terasem movement that they've been</v>

4270
02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:26.820
<v Speaker 5>putting forward as that,</v>

4271
02:01:26.940 --> 02:01:27.773
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4272
02:01:27.990 --> 02:01:29.010
<v Speaker 5>we can,</v>

4273
02:01:29.140 --> 02:01:29.610
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4274
02:01:29.610 --> 02:01:34.610
<v Speaker 5>program as much of the information about our lives and about,</v>

4275
02:01:35.910 --> 02:01:36.743
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4276
02:01:36.810 --> 02:01:37.240
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4277
02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:40.700
<v Speaker 5>by filling out basically in an elaborate questionnaire.</v>

4278
02:01:41.270 --> 02:01:43.370
<v Speaker 5>And this also records,</v>

4279
02:01:43.520 --> 02:01:44.030
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4280
02:01:44.030 --> 02:01:48.500
<v Speaker 5>our voice telling stories and things like that and the way that we inflect and</v>

4281
02:01:48.650 --> 02:01:49.190
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4282
02:01:49.190 --> 02:01:49.730
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

4283
02:01:49.730 --> 02:01:53.180
<v Speaker 5>So these modulations and things become part of,</v>

4284
02:01:53.390 --> 02:01:53.990
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4285
02:01:53.990 --> 02:01:56.660
<v Speaker 5>what could be a virtual being.</v>

4286
02:01:56.780 --> 02:01:58.250
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't have to be a robot.</v>

4287
02:01:58.610 --> 02:01:59.510
<v Speaker 5>It can be,</v>

4288
02:01:59.570 --> 02:02:00.320
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4289
02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:01.700
<v Speaker 5>for the virtual heaven,</v>

4290
02:02:01.880 --> 02:02:03.230
<v Speaker 5>a just a facsimile,</v>

4291
02:02:03.231 --> 02:02:05.930
<v Speaker 5>a three d model that's based on the,</v>

4292
02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:06.680
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4293
02:02:06.680 --> 02:02:07.513
<v Speaker 5>sort of,</v>

4294
02:02:07.810 --> 02:02:08.180
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4295
02:02:08.180 --> 02:02:09.013
<v Speaker 5>3-d,</v>

4296
02:02:09.790 --> 02:02:10.550
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4297
02:02:10.550 --> 02:02:14.150
<v Speaker 5>mapping of the head and,</v>

4298
02:02:14.310 --> 02:02:14.960
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4299
02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:15.793
<v Speaker 5>maybe the,</v>

4300
02:02:16.220 --> 02:02:17.720
<v Speaker 5>the chest or something like that.</v>

4301
02:02:18.020 --> 02:02:19.020
<v Speaker 5>So you have a,</v>

4302
02:02:19.150 --> 02:02:24.150
<v Speaker 5>a sense of the person and you might ask a virtual grandma or Grandpa who passed</v>

4303
02:02:25.731 --> 02:02:27.620
<v Speaker 5>on several decades ago,</v>

4304
02:02:27.710 --> 02:02:32.710
<v Speaker 5>but the great grandkids can now access them via this virtual grandma,</v>

4305
02:02:33.710 --> 02:02:34.280
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4306
02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:36.560
<v Speaker 5>that can say yes,</v>

4307
02:02:36.561 --> 02:02:37.550
<v Speaker 5>when I was growing up,</v>

4308
02:02:37.551 --> 02:02:37.761
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>

4309
02:02:37.761 --> 02:02:37.911
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>

4310
02:02:37.911 --> 02:02:38.360
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>

4311
02:02:38.360 --> 02:02:38.661
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4312
02:02:38.661 --> 02:02:40.130
<v Speaker 5>and share a story or something.</v>

4313
02:02:40.370 --> 02:02:41.930
<v Speaker 5>Now what's wrong with that?</v>

4314
02:02:42.260 --> 02:02:43.190
<v Speaker 5>What's wrong with that?</v>

4315
02:02:43.270 --> 02:02:48.210
<v Speaker 1>There's something crazy about turning grandma and grandma has a great beyond,</v>

4316
02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:48.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4317
02:02:48.610 --> 02:02:49.960
<v Speaker 1>so she was knitting.</v>

4318
02:02:50.130 --> 02:02:50.600
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4319
02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:52.270
<v Speaker 1>There's something fucking creepy about that.</v>

4320
02:02:52.271 --> 02:02:52.571
<v Speaker 1>Bad.</v>

4321
02:02:52.571 --> 02:02:52.751
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4322
02:02:52.751 --> 02:02:54.460
<v Speaker 1>maybe we need to let things go.</v>

4323
02:02:55.090 --> 02:02:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we need to realize that,</v>

4324
02:02:56.471 --> 02:02:56.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4325
02:02:56.771 --> 02:03:00.310
<v Speaker 1>grandma's the past and whatever great memories that we had of her shower,</v>

4326
02:03:00.330 --> 02:03:03.100
<v Speaker 1>are you going to close her Facebook account?</v>

4327
02:03:04.290 --> 02:03:07.120
<v Speaker 1>You imagine if grandma's Facebook account becomes her.</v>

4328
02:03:07.570 --> 02:03:08.403
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

4329
02:03:09.300 --> 02:03:10.330
<v Speaker 1>that's nuts.</v>

4330
02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:11.740
<v Speaker 1>God dammit.</v>

4331
02:03:11.890 --> 02:03:12.610
<v Speaker 1>But it's Kinda calm,</v>

4332
02:03:12.610 --> 02:03:12.881
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4333
02:03:12.881 --> 02:03:13.714
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4334
02:03:14.150 --> 02:03:15.700
<v Speaker 1>on Facebook a thousand years ago,</v>

4335
02:03:16.870 --> 02:03:19.720
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that a blade runner type scenarios,</v>

4336
02:03:19.721 --> 02:03:24.721
<v Speaker 1>inevitable though where they have a life that is artificial but act so much like</v>

4337
02:03:25.781 --> 02:03:28.480
<v Speaker 1>us that it itself doesn't even know it's artificial.</v>

4338
02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:31.690
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're going to program a robot correctly,</v>

4339
02:03:32.050 --> 02:03:32.861
<v Speaker 1>to be a,</v>

4340
02:03:32.861 --> 02:03:34.810
<v Speaker 1>an artificial person that acts like a person,</v>

4341
02:03:34.811 --> 02:03:36.190
<v Speaker 1>you don't tell them and it's hard official,</v>

4342
02:03:36.340 --> 02:03:37.540
<v Speaker 1>you want them thinking they're real.</v>

4343
02:03:37.690 --> 02:03:38.020
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4344
02:03:38.020 --> 02:03:38.561
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

4345
02:03:38.561 --> 02:03:40.750
<v Speaker 1>Like it would be the blade runner scenario.</v>

4346
02:03:40.890 --> 02:03:41.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4347
02:03:41.530 --> 02:03:43.090
<v Speaker 1>That was God damn brilliant movie.</v>

4348
02:03:43.150 --> 02:03:43.691
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

4349
02:03:43.691 --> 02:03:44.220
<v Speaker 1>it was shown</v>

4350
02:03:44.220 --> 02:03:44.701
<v Speaker 5>amazing.</v>

4351
02:03:44.701 --> 02:03:45.840
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

4352
02:03:45.841 --> 02:03:50.841
<v Speaker 5>what it might mirror is this whole thing about the neanderthal and the,</v>

4353
02:03:51.450 --> 02:03:52.830
<v Speaker 5>and our early,</v>

4354
02:03:53.040 --> 02:03:53.890
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4355
02:03:54.030 --> 02:03:54.930
<v Speaker 5>relationship.</v>

4356
02:03:54.950 --> 02:03:56.610
<v Speaker 5>I as species we,</v>

4357
02:03:57.240 --> 02:03:57.721
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4358
02:03:57.721 --> 02:04:01.360
<v Speaker 5>for thousands and thousands of years cohabited uh,</v>

4359
02:04:01.380 --> 02:04:06.380
<v Speaker 5>the same areas and what kind of a neanderthal genocide happened there,</v>

4360
02:04:07.080 --> 02:04:07.680
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4361
02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:08.010
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

4362
02:04:08.010 --> 02:04:08.261
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

4363
02:04:08.261 --> 02:04:08.501
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

4364
02:04:08.501 --> 02:04:10.770
<v Speaker 5>what was the shadow of our species,</v>

4365
02:04:10.771 --> 02:04:11.131
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4366
02:04:11.131 --> 02:04:13.800
<v Speaker 5>built on this fire relationship.</v>

4367
02:04:13.850 --> 02:04:15.960
<v Speaker 5>Do you think they just naturally dark at all?</v>

4368
02:04:16.510 --> 02:04:17.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

4369
02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:18.240
<v Speaker 1>I think we definitely chilled them.</v>

4370
02:04:18.260 --> 02:04:19.390
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see the people?</v>

4371
02:04:19.391 --> 02:04:22.450
<v Speaker 1>There's a one guy said it's a really sketchy theory,</v>

4372
02:04:22.451 --> 02:04:23.110
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

4373
02:04:23.110 --> 02:04:28.110
<v Speaker 1>he painted in the end tall as like a gorilla faced Predator and uh,</v>

4374
02:04:28.630 --> 02:04:33.190
<v Speaker 1>he tried to say that Newton neanderthal probably hunted man and that's why we</v>

4375
02:04:33.191 --> 02:04:37.000
<v Speaker 1>drove it to extinction and that we based our image of what neanderthal looked</v>

4376
02:04:37.020 --> 02:04:39.510
<v Speaker 1>like based on human skin,</v>

4377
02:04:39.780 --> 02:04:42.570
<v Speaker 1>but we don't really have any skin from the inner towels.</v>

4378
02:04:42.571 --> 02:04:46.830
<v Speaker 1>We know that they were far stronger than people and we know that they had a much</v>

4379
02:04:46.831 --> 02:04:48.120
<v Speaker 1>thicker bone structure.</v>

4380
02:04:48.121 --> 02:04:48.871
<v Speaker 1>They were smaller,</v>

4381
02:04:48.871 --> 02:04:49.890
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like five feet tall,</v>

4382
02:04:49.891 --> 02:04:51.300
<v Speaker 1>but they would weigh 200 pounds.</v>

4383
02:04:51.630 --> 02:04:52.351
<v Speaker 1>They were really,</v>

4384
02:04:52.351 --> 02:04:53.820
<v Speaker 1>really incredibly strong.</v>

4385
02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:54.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4386
02:04:54.211 --> 02:04:55.044
<v Speaker 1>Well they were more,</v>

4387
02:04:56.060 --> 02:04:56.610
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4388
02:04:56.610 --> 02:05:00.180
<v Speaker 1>more like a lower primate then like a human or a homosapien.</v>

4389
02:05:00.210 --> 02:05:01.140
<v Speaker 1>And so this guy,</v>

4390
02:05:01.320 --> 02:05:02.250
<v Speaker 1>see if he could pull that up,</v>

4391
02:05:02.251 --> 02:05:02.550
<v Speaker 1>Brian.</v>

4392
02:05:02.550 --> 02:05:03.361
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty trippy.</v>

4393
02:05:03.361 --> 02:05:04.950
<v Speaker 1>It's mostly bullshit,</v>

4394
02:05:04.951 --> 02:05:06.180
<v Speaker 1>but it's Kinda fun bullshit.</v>

4395
02:05:07.020 --> 02:05:07.720
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>

4396
02:05:07.720 --> 02:05:08.553
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4397
02:05:08.650 --> 02:05:10.300
<v Speaker 1>fuck w what would you say?</v>

4398
02:05:10.450 --> 02:05:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4399
02:05:11.260 --> 02:05:13.470
<v Speaker 1>neander tall predator.</v>

4400
02:05:13.590 --> 02:05:14.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4401
02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:15.090
<v Speaker 1>See if you find that.</v>

4402
02:05:15.270 --> 02:05:18.510
<v Speaker 1>And he had like a whole video where they mapped out,</v>

4403
02:05:18.570 --> 02:05:19.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4404
02:05:19.020 --> 02:05:24.020
<v Speaker 1>in his opinion what it would look like in a three d imagery.</v>

4405
02:05:24.300 --> 02:05:27.720
<v Speaker 1>And so we had this really scary looking chimpanzee thing.</v>

4406
02:05:27.900 --> 02:05:28.950
<v Speaker 1>Big giant eyes.</v>

4407
02:05:29.130 --> 02:05:31.230
<v Speaker 1>We don't have any eye tissue from the intercalls either.</v>

4408
02:05:31.231 --> 02:05:33.720
<v Speaker 1>And they have a much larger eyeball humans.</v>

4409
02:05:33.960 --> 02:05:34.141
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4410
02:05:34.141 --> 02:05:34.591
<v Speaker 1>they're bought it.</v>

4411
02:05:34.591 --> 02:05:34.980
<v Speaker 1>They're just,</v>

4412
02:05:34.980 --> 02:05:36.270
<v Speaker 1>they're built fairly differently.</v>

4413
02:05:36.271 --> 02:05:38.870
<v Speaker 1>So this guy true them up like crazy gorilla monsters.</v>

4414
02:05:39.420 --> 02:05:40.260
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

4415
02:05:40.610 --> 02:05:40.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4416
02:05:40.890 --> 02:05:42.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's right,</v>

4417
02:05:42.240 --> 02:05:43.290
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>

4418
02:05:43.291 --> 02:05:48.291
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of cool to look at and it's interesting just to conceive of it is wow.</v>

4419
02:05:49.500 --> 02:05:50.400
<v Speaker 1>That's how he drew it.</v>

4420
02:05:50.401 --> 02:05:53.430
<v Speaker 1>He drew it like they might've been Harry and they might've been like,</v>

4421
02:05:53.460 --> 02:05:53.640
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

4422
02:05:53.640 --> 02:05:58.020
<v Speaker 1>They were really muscular and he made them look more chimpanzee like then,</v>

4423
02:05:58.040 --> 02:05:58.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4424
02:05:58.240 --> 02:05:59.280
<v Speaker 1>then human like,</v>

4425
02:06:00.070 --> 02:06:00.870
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4426
02:06:00.870 --> 02:06:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>

4427
02:06:01.650 --> 02:06:01.801
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4428
02:06:01.801 --> 02:06:03.160
<v Speaker 1>He did a whole documentary on it.</v>

4429
02:06:03.190 --> 02:06:05.550
<v Speaker 1>I think it's probably bullshit.</v>

4430
02:06:07.500 --> 02:06:08.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4431
02:06:08.040 --> 02:06:08.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4432
02:06:08.581 --> 02:06:12.780
<v Speaker 1>you could genetically imagine you're yourself into a Sasquatch.</v>

4433
02:06:13.210 --> 02:06:14.043
<v Speaker 1>I was going to ask you,</v>

4434
02:06:15.150 --> 02:06:16.530
<v Speaker 1>I've been hunting for south Crotch,</v>

4435
02:06:16.940 --> 02:06:17.581
<v Speaker 1>not hunting,</v>

4436
02:06:17.581 --> 02:06:18.510
<v Speaker 1>like trying to hurt him.</v>

4437
02:06:18.980 --> 02:06:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4438
02:06:19.130 --> 02:06:19.710
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

4439
02:06:19.710 --> 02:06:21.540
<v Speaker 1>I should say searching for Sasquatch.</v>

4440
02:06:21.810 --> 02:06:22.920
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing this TV show.</v>

4441
02:06:22.930 --> 02:06:25.290
<v Speaker 1>We went up to Washington state and uh,</v>

4442
02:06:25.291 --> 02:06:28.960
<v Speaker 1>we stayed in the woods out near Mount Rainier and uh,</v>

4443
02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:30.060
<v Speaker 1>it's like a tropical rain.</v>

4444
02:06:30.061 --> 02:06:30.851
<v Speaker 1>I mean not tropical,</v>

4445
02:06:30.851 --> 02:06:32.100
<v Speaker 1>a rain up there,</v>

4446
02:06:32.180 --> 02:06:33.140
<v Speaker 1>real rain forest.</v>

4447
02:06:33.160 --> 02:06:34.410
<v Speaker 1>Like if you've never been up there,</v>

4448
02:06:34.710 --> 02:06:35.970
<v Speaker 1>you've no idea what that's like.</v>

4449
02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:37.680
<v Speaker 1>It's the weirdest environment ever.</v>

4450
02:06:37.920 --> 02:06:39.360
<v Speaker 1>You Park your car,</v>

4451
02:06:39.510 --> 02:06:43.290
<v Speaker 1>you take a walk you a hundred yards into the woods and you might as well be on</v>

4452
02:06:43.291 --> 02:06:44.124
<v Speaker 1>another planet.</v>

4453
02:06:44.240 --> 02:06:44.791
<v Speaker 1>You are,</v>

4454
02:06:44.791 --> 02:06:47.310
<v Speaker 1>you're literally enter into a different dimension.</v>

4455
02:06:47.520 --> 02:06:48.510
<v Speaker 1>There's the dimension of,</v>

4456
02:06:49.170 --> 02:06:53.190
<v Speaker 1>of there's a dimension of highways and houses and that's all out there.</v>

4457
02:06:53.340 --> 02:06:55.010
<v Speaker 1>But once you go into a rain forest,</v>

4458
02:06:55.020 --> 02:06:55.650
<v Speaker 1>like you just,</v>

4459
02:06:55.650 --> 02:07:00.210
<v Speaker 1>you go a little bit in and then you're engulfed by this new reality and this</v>

4460
02:07:00.211 --> 02:07:00.661
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>

4461
02:07:00.661 --> 02:07:04.290
<v Speaker 1>as you see an elk running past you and they disappear in the trees cause</v>

4462
02:07:04.291 --> 02:07:05.470
<v Speaker 1>everything is so thick and,</v>

4463
02:07:05.970 --> 02:07:07.200
<v Speaker 1>and people start to see pig foot,</v>

4464
02:07:08.140 --> 02:07:08.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4465
02:07:08.420 --> 02:07:09.480
<v Speaker 1>they start seeing anything,</v>

4466
02:07:09.481 --> 02:07:09.851
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4467
02:07:09.851 --> 02:07:11.430
<v Speaker 1>you know what the fuck is out there?</v>

4468
02:07:11.630 --> 02:07:14.940
<v Speaker 1>You think big foot's preposterous until you go to a rain forest,</v>

4469
02:07:14.941 --> 02:07:17.490
<v Speaker 1>like the Pacific northwest and you're walking around and you're like,</v>

4470
02:07:17.491 --> 02:07:17.941
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

4471
02:07:17.941 --> 02:07:18.900
<v Speaker 1>maybe man.</v>

4472
02:07:19.540 --> 02:07:20.373
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4473
02:07:20.530 --> 02:07:20.920
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4474
02:07:20.920 --> 02:07:22.100
<v Speaker 1>Quiet eight now.</v>

4475
02:07:22.190 --> 02:07:25.020
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at the earliest,</v>

4476
02:07:25.260 --> 02:07:26.093
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4477
02:07:26.220 --> 02:07:28.320
<v Speaker 1>kind of human animal,</v>

4478
02:07:28.321 --> 02:07:30.180
<v Speaker 1>hybrid cave art,</v>

4479
02:07:30.220 --> 02:07:30.690
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4480
02:07:30.690 --> 02:07:34.470
<v Speaker 1>You have something that looks oddly like a Sasquatch type,</v>

4481
02:07:34.550 --> 02:07:35.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4482
02:07:35.100 --> 02:07:35.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4483
02:07:35.500 --> 02:07:35.891
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

4484
02:07:35.891 --> 02:07:35.980
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

4485
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:36.131
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

4486
02:07:36.131 --> 02:07:36.964
<v Speaker 5>because it's,</v>

4487
02:07:37.060 --> 02:07:40.450
<v Speaker 5>it's just a marriage of the stag and the human,</v>

4488
02:07:40.630 --> 02:07:44.470
<v Speaker 5>and so it's got characteristics of the animal and the human together.</v>

4489
02:07:44.830 --> 02:07:46.750
<v Speaker 5>They didn't love that stuff really early on.</v>

4490
02:07:47.020 --> 02:07:47.660
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

4491
02:07:47.660 --> 02:07:48.493
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4492
02:07:48.880 --> 02:07:50.500
<v Speaker 5>look at all the Egyptian art,</v>

4493
02:07:50.560 --> 02:07:50.861
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4494
02:07:50.861 --> 02:07:51.610
<v Speaker 5>it's Paul.</v>

4495
02:07:51.610 --> 02:07:52.400
<v Speaker 5>What do you think that is?</v>

4496
02:07:52.400 --> 02:07:54.130
<v Speaker 5>The fusion of the creature,</v>

4497
02:07:54.131 --> 02:07:55.030
<v Speaker 5>the animal,</v>

4498
02:07:55.031 --> 02:07:56.080
<v Speaker 5>the theory and Morph,</v>

4499
02:07:56.110 --> 02:07:56.710
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4500
02:07:56.710 --> 02:07:57.190
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4501
02:07:57.190 --> 02:07:58.330
<v Speaker 5>it's called theory and morph.</v>

4502
02:07:58.450 --> 02:07:59.930
<v Speaker 5>That's a term for it.</v>

4503
02:08:00.490 --> 02:08:02.620
<v Speaker 5>Isn't that what those furies call themselves too?</v>

4504
02:08:02.860 --> 02:08:04.150
<v Speaker 5>They call themselves therians.</v>

4505
02:08:04.690 --> 02:08:04.990
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

4506
02:08:04.990 --> 02:08:05.823
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4507
02:08:07.270 --> 02:08:08.310
<v Speaker 5>I think that that's a,</v>

4508
02:08:08.410 --> 02:08:09.243
<v Speaker 5>probably a,</v>

4509
02:08:09.760 --> 02:08:12.660
<v Speaker 6>not that there's anything wrong with being a furry and much love.</v>

4510
02:08:12.810 --> 02:08:14.140
<v Speaker 6>My mascot friends,</v>

4511
02:08:17.190 --> 02:08:20.740
<v Speaker 6>I accidentally stumbled into a furry conventional once in Pittsburgh.</v>

4512
02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:22.240
<v Speaker 6>It was,</v>

4513
02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:22.930
<v Speaker 6>you know what?</v>

4514
02:08:22.930 --> 02:08:24.010
<v Speaker 6>It's going to sound stupid,</v>

4515
02:08:24.190 --> 02:08:25.300
<v Speaker 6>but I thought it was beautiful.</v>

4516
02:08:25.700 --> 02:08:28.630
<v Speaker 6>I thought it was beautiful that these people found a place where they could all</v>

4517
02:08:28.631 --> 02:08:30.070
<v Speaker 6>get together and do this.</v>

4518
02:08:30.130 --> 02:08:32.410
<v Speaker 6>The obviously they liked doing it,</v>

4519
02:08:32.530 --> 02:08:33.490
<v Speaker 6>they liked doing it.</v>

4520
02:08:33.610 --> 02:08:34.091
<v Speaker 6>And where,</v>

4521
02:08:34.091 --> 02:08:34.391
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4522
02:08:34.391 --> 02:08:35.560
<v Speaker 6>if you do that in your neighborhood,</v>

4523
02:08:35.561 --> 02:08:35.980
<v Speaker 6>people going,</v>

4524
02:08:35.980 --> 02:08:37.120
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck are you doing man?</v>

4525
02:08:37.121 --> 02:08:38.530
<v Speaker 6>Why are you dressed up like a giant chipmunk?</v>

4526
02:08:39.010 --> 02:08:40.480
<v Speaker 6>But for whatever reason,</v>

4527
02:08:40.481 --> 02:08:41.800
<v Speaker 6>I don't know why they liked doing it,</v>

4528
02:08:41.801 --> 02:08:44.230
<v Speaker 6>but it doesn't seem like they're hurting anybody.</v>

4529
02:08:44.410 --> 02:08:45.550
<v Speaker 6>And we were walking,</v>

4530
02:08:45.551 --> 02:08:46.900
<v Speaker 6>they seem so happy.</v>

4531
02:08:47.200 --> 02:08:48.610
<v Speaker 6>But walking down the street and all these,</v>

4532
02:08:48.730 --> 02:08:52.930
<v Speaker 6>these fairy dudes and gals were laughing and talking together all with their</v>

4533
02:08:52.931 --> 02:08:55.120
<v Speaker 6>crazy costumes on and nobody took the shit off.</v>

4534
02:08:55.600 --> 02:08:56.081
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>

4535
02:08:56.081 --> 02:08:57.250
<v Speaker 6>this is the weirdest thing ever.</v>

4536
02:08:57.251 --> 02:08:58.660
<v Speaker 6>But it looks so fun.</v>

4537
02:08:58.840 --> 02:09:02.310
<v Speaker 6>It's embodying our kind of doctors shoes.</v>

4538
02:09:02.311 --> 02:09:02.940
<v Speaker 6>So like,</v>

4539
02:09:02.940 --> 02:09:03.773
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4540
02:09:04.680 --> 02:09:09.680
<v Speaker 5>zany truth about the world of creatures that we're a part of and it's</v>

4541
02:09:12.901 --> 02:09:14.700
<v Speaker 5>acknowledging that we're part of,</v>

4542
02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:15.180
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4543
02:09:15.180 --> 02:09:15.810
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

4544
02:09:15.810 --> 02:09:16.643
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4545
02:09:16.800 --> 02:09:17.461
<v Speaker 5>almost,</v>

4546
02:09:17.461 --> 02:09:18.020
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4547
02:09:18.020 --> 02:09:20.310
<v Speaker 5>interdimensional um,</v>

4548
02:09:20.820 --> 02:09:23.100
<v Speaker 5>and web of creatures.</v>

4549
02:09:23.490 --> 02:09:25.980
<v Speaker 5>And I think that the early stuff,</v>

4550
02:09:25.981 --> 02:09:27.990
<v Speaker 5>the Egyptian and all,</v>

4551
02:09:27.991 --> 02:09:31.240
<v Speaker 5>all the cave art and things like that really does,</v>

4552
02:09:31.290 --> 02:09:36.290
<v Speaker 5>did come out of a place of higher awareness that that was the kind of a nature</v>

4553
02:09:37.470 --> 02:09:37.630
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible]</v>

4554
02:09:37.630 --> 02:09:38.320
<v Speaker 6>just citizen.</v>

4555
02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:38.591
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4556
02:09:38.591 --> 02:09:39.480
<v Speaker 6>like a lot of seconds,</v>

4557
02:09:39.481 --> 02:09:44.481
<v Speaker 6>the psychedelic drugs have animal ideas in embedded in them.</v>

4558
02:09:44.950 --> 02:09:46.300
<v Speaker 6>And I'm absolutely,</v>

4559
02:09:46.690 --> 02:09:48.970
<v Speaker 6>especially with DMT or Iowasca,</v>

4560
02:09:48.971 --> 02:09:51.010
<v Speaker 6>there's the jaguars are leopards,</v>

4561
02:09:51.070 --> 02:09:51.521
<v Speaker 6>jaguars,</v>

4562
02:09:51.521 --> 02:09:51.730
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4563
02:09:51.730 --> 02:09:53.410
<v Speaker 6>Jaguars and snakes and,</v>

4564
02:09:53.411 --> 02:09:53.980
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

4565
02:09:53.980 --> 02:09:55.720
<v Speaker 6>And those sort of things.</v>

4566
02:09:55.721 --> 02:09:56.150
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4567
02:09:56.150 --> 02:09:57.930
<v Speaker 6>I'd only kind of make sense place.</v>

4568
02:09:58.000 --> 02:09:58.691
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>

4569
02:09:58.691 --> 02:10:02.230
<v Speaker 6>Or maybe it could have been many different psychedelic compounds we don't even</v>

4570
02:10:02.231 --> 02:10:05.110
<v Speaker 6>know about anymore that these people would found and that,</v>

4571
02:10:05.160 --> 02:10:07.390
<v Speaker 6>that put him them together with these,</v>

4572
02:10:07.620 --> 02:10:08.560
<v Speaker 6>these ideas.</v>

4573
02:10:08.561 --> 02:10:12.370
<v Speaker 6>And I've combining animals and human into one form.</v>

4574
02:10:13.080 --> 02:10:13.600
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

4575
02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:13.841
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4576
02:10:13.841 --> 02:10:14.500
<v Speaker 6>it's a,</v>

4577
02:10:14.500 --> 02:10:14.890
<v Speaker 6>an,</v>

4578
02:10:14.890 --> 02:10:16.060
<v Speaker 6>an easy transfer.</v>

4579
02:10:16.061 --> 02:10:17.550
<v Speaker 6>And the thing that I found</v>

4580
02:10:17.710 --> 02:10:21.820
<v Speaker 5>refreshing in the Egyptian temples and things was,</v>

4581
02:10:22.370 --> 02:10:23.203
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4582
02:10:23.710 --> 02:10:28.710
<v Speaker 5>how easy it was to transpose a head and a staff of one creature and another onto</v>

4583
02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:32.120
<v Speaker 5>a human body and how I,</v>

4584
02:10:32.280 --> 02:10:35.010
<v Speaker 5>they were considered the gods.</v>

4585
02:10:36.510 --> 02:10:39.000
<v Speaker 5>Now if your job is to,</v>

4586
02:10:39.300 --> 02:10:39.630
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4587
02:10:39.630 --> 02:10:40.770
<v Speaker 5>sacred eyes,</v>

<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4589
02:10:41.760 --> 02:10:42.900
<v Speaker 5>the nature field,</v>

4590
02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:43.530
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4591
02:10:43.530 --> 02:10:44.880
<v Speaker 5>to give a sense of,</v>

4592
02:10:44.940 --> 02:10:45.330
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4593
02:10:45.330 --> 02:10:47.040
<v Speaker 5>the place that we live in is a,</v>

4594
02:10:47.041 --> 02:10:48.420
<v Speaker 5>is a gift of the,</v>

4595
02:10:48.870 --> 02:10:50.340
<v Speaker 5>of a divine creator.</v>

4596
02:10:50.700 --> 02:10:51.533
<v Speaker 5>And there are,</v>

4597
02:10:51.580 --> 02:10:52.050
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4598
02:10:52.050 --> 02:10:52.380
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4599
02:10:52.380 --> 02:10:57.380
<v Speaker 5>then if you're gods actually are different animals or they have animal</v>

4600
02:10:58.501 --> 02:10:59.460
<v Speaker 5>characteristics,</v>

4601
02:10:59.670 --> 02:11:00.000
<v Speaker 5>more,</v>

4602
02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:05.000
<v Speaker 5>you're more apt to treat the animal with some respect or as being an aspect of</v>

4603
02:11:06.991 --> 02:11:08.010
<v Speaker 5>that divinity.</v>

4604
02:11:08.610 --> 02:11:09.960
<v Speaker 5>And so the,</v>

4605
02:11:10.050 --> 02:11:10.201
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4606
02:11:10.201 --> 02:11:12.270
<v Speaker 5>the translation of the,</v>

4607
02:11:12.330 --> 02:11:12.900
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4608
02:11:12.900 --> 02:11:17.900
<v Speaker 5>the archetypal symbol of a particular animal spirit and a divine human form is</v>

4609
02:11:21.601 --> 02:11:25.710
<v Speaker 5>to acknowledge our oneness with that kind of,</v>

4610
02:11:25.770 --> 02:11:26.400
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4611
02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:27.520
<v Speaker 5>the field of,</v>

4612
02:11:27.550 --> 02:11:29.040
<v Speaker 5>of the animal spirits.</v>

4613
02:11:29.430 --> 02:11:31.230
<v Speaker 5>And it's a very shamonic,</v>

4614
02:11:31.290 --> 02:11:32.123
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4615
02:11:32.220 --> 02:11:33.240
<v Speaker 5>kind of thing to do.</v>

4616
02:11:33.241 --> 02:11:33.600
<v Speaker 5>And it,</v>

4617
02:11:33.600 --> 02:11:35.250
<v Speaker 5>and it was part of many of the,</v>

4618
02:11:35.570 --> 02:11:36.030
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4619
02:11:36.030 --> 02:11:38.400
<v Speaker 5>like the Mesopotamian Babylonian,</v>

4620
02:11:38.580 --> 02:11:39.413
<v Speaker 5>Assyrian,</v>

4621
02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:40.313
<v Speaker 5>Egyptian,</v>

4622

4627
02:11:45.450 --> 02:11:45.930
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4628
02:11:45.930 --> 02:11:50.820
<v Speaker 5>fusion from the very earliest cave art all the way through the great religious</v>

4629
02:11:50.821 --> 02:11:51.660
<v Speaker 5>kinds of things.</v>

4630
02:11:51.720 --> 02:11:53.250
<v Speaker 5>Angels have wings there,</v>

4631
02:11:53.251 --> 02:11:55.100
<v Speaker 5>animal and human hive.</v>

4632
02:11:55.470 --> 02:11:56.460
<v Speaker 5>That's a really good,</v>

4633
02:11:56.461 --> 02:11:56.860
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4634
02:11:56.860 --> 02:12:00.900
<v Speaker 5>I never even thought of until just now that it's still part of the public</v>

4635
02:12:00.901 --> 02:12:01.711
<v Speaker 5>imagination,</v>

4636

4640
02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:07.500
<v Speaker 1>I just thought there were people with wings,</v>

4641
02:12:07.530 --> 02:12:08.071
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

4642
02:12:08.071 --> 02:12:08.940
<v Speaker 1>obviously not.</v>

4643
02:12:09.350 --> 02:12:09.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4644
02:12:09.640 --> 02:12:10.680
<v Speaker 1>if they had a bird's head,</v>

4645
02:12:10.681 --> 02:12:11.251
<v Speaker 1>then you'd be like,</v>

4646
02:12:11.251 --> 02:12:12.084
<v Speaker 1>they're part bird.</v>

4647
02:12:12.120 --> 02:12:13.260
<v Speaker 1>But as long as they have a human side,</v>

4648
02:12:13.261 --> 02:12:15.900
<v Speaker 1>you like not even a bird man in jail.</v>

4649
02:12:16.140 --> 02:12:16.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4650
02:12:16.610 --> 02:12:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Carson so much</v>

4651
02:12:18.920 --> 02:12:20.420
<v Speaker 5>because we,</v>

4652
02:12:20.510 --> 02:12:21.230
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4653
02:12:21.230 --> 02:12:21.531
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4654
02:12:21.531 --> 02:12:26.531
<v Speaker 5>the idea of there being a higher world that we ascend to symbolically,</v>

4655
02:12:26.901 --> 02:12:29.390
<v Speaker 5>it's so transparent that we don't even notice it.</v>

4656
02:12:29.450 --> 02:12:32.840
<v Speaker 5>It's just like there and,</v>

4657

<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4780
02:15:46.391 --> 02:15:47.181
<v Speaker 6>symbols run together,</v>

4781
02:15:47.181 --> 02:15:51.440
<v Speaker 6>your mind starts to try to form patterns and you start to try to think the way</v>

4782
02:15:51.441 --> 02:15:56.441
<v Speaker 6>these people were thinking and see these incredibly complex geometric shapes</v>

4783
02:15:57.621 --> 02:15:59.480
<v Speaker 6>that they had turned into buildings,</v>

4784

<v Speaker 6>this gigantic building where each segment represents different shock rose and</v>

4786
02:16:07.611 --> 02:16:09.310
<v Speaker 6>different energy points in the human body.</v>

4787
02:16:09.340 --> 02:16:14.340
<v Speaker 6>There's texts around each one explaining this part of the human body.</v>

4788
02:16:14.430 --> 02:16:15.200
<v Speaker 6>Like it's,</v>

4876
02:18:19.540 --> 02:18:21.970
<v Speaker 5>of the Nether worlds was the result of that.</v>

4877
02:18:22.480 --> 02:18:22.661
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4878
02:18:22.661 --> 02:18:25.870
<v Speaker 5>of course set was extremely disturbed and,</v>

4879
02:18:25.930 --> 02:18:26.620
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4880
02:18:26.620 --> 02:18:29.590
<v Speaker 5>decided that he was going to find a way to kill ocirus,</v>

4881
02:18:30.070 --> 02:18:33.880
<v Speaker 5>which eventually happened and he cut him up and threw them all over,</v>

4882
02:18:33.970 --> 02:18:34.600
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4883
02:18:34.600 --> 02:18:35.433
<v Speaker 5>denial.</v>

4884
02:18:36.040 --> 02:18:41.040
<v Speaker 5>And so isis was extremely distraught and she went around finding,</v>

4885
02:18:42.540 --> 02:18:43.030
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4886
02:18:43.030 --> 02:18:48.030
<v Speaker 5>or remembering parts of the dismembered God and each place where she found a</v>

4887
02:18:50.531 --> 02:18:54.100
<v Speaker 5>hand or a flood or something like that at temple was built.</v>

4888
02:18:54.610 --> 02:18:55.443
<v Speaker 5>And so you would,</v>

4889
02:18:55.450 --> 02:18:57.010
<v Speaker 5>you would go down the Nile,</v>

4890
02:18:57.430 --> 02:18:57.760
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4891
02:18:57.760 --> 02:18:58.540
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

4892
02:18:58.540 --> 02:18:59.170
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4893
02:18:59.170 --> 02:19:02.740
<v Speaker 5>remember the God and that's,</v>

4894
02:19:02.800 --> 02:19:04.930
<v Speaker 5>that's the idea is just,</v>

4895
02:19:05.050 --> 02:19:05.530
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4896
02:19:05.530 --> 02:19:06.363
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4897
02:19:06.520 --> 02:19:08.080
<v Speaker 5>now I think that it,</v>

4898
02:19:08.140 --> 02:19:08.740
<v Speaker 5>of course,</v>

4899
02:19:08.740 --> 02:19:11.620
<v Speaker 5>it's the goddess that's been lost.</v>

4900
02:19:11.710 --> 02:19:14.230
<v Speaker 5>That's been a dismembered,</v>

4901
02:19:14.710 --> 02:19:15.130
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4902
02:19:15.130 --> 02:19:16.420
<v Speaker 5>the mother earth.</v>

4903
02:19:17.050 --> 02:19:18.190
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

4904
02:19:18.280 --> 02:19:20.710
<v Speaker 5>so the idea is to,</v>

4905
02:19:20.790 --> 02:19:21.130
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4906
02:19:21.130 --> 02:19:24.280
<v Speaker 5>we have different stations on the land where there'll be a foot,</v>

4907
02:19:24.340 --> 02:19:26.380
<v Speaker 5>there'll be hand and different things like that.</v>

4908
02:19:26.381 --> 02:19:28.130
<v Speaker 5>They'll represent different elements</v>

4909
02:19:28.700 --> 02:19:30.830
<v Speaker 3>of the dismembered a mother.</v>

4910
02:19:31.930 --> 02:19:34.340
<v Speaker 3>So we go around to remember,</v>

4911
02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:35.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4912
02:19:35.090 --> 02:19:35.690
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4913
02:19:35.690 --> 02:19:36.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4914
02:19:36.410 --> 02:19:41.060
<v Speaker 3>the mother and to re new ourselves and to read new nature.</v>

4915
02:19:41.270 --> 02:19:46.270
<v Speaker 3>Trying to wrap your mind around Egyptian mythology and what they were,</v>

4916
02:19:46.461 --> 02:19:51.040
<v Speaker 3>what they meant by that and the origin of that and how it led them to the</v>

4917
02:19:51.130 --> 02:19:55.400
<v Speaker 3>society that was able to create those insane structures.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They made this and then they left.</v>

4937
02:20:17.150 --> 02:20:19.100
<v Speaker 3>Somebody left behind this.</v>

4938
02:20:20.450 --> 02:20:20.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4939
02:20:20.930 --> 02:20:24.290
<v Speaker 3>And you and people return there.</v>

4940
02:20:24.440 --> 02:20:25.520
<v Speaker 3>You returned there.</v>

4941
02:20:25.770 --> 02:20:26.580
<v Speaker 3>We returned there.</v>

4942
02:20:26.580 --> 02:20:27.440
<v Speaker 3>Nobody there is there.</v>

4943
02:20:27.560 --> 02:20:28.130
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4944
02:20:28.130 --> 02:20:28.281
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

4945
02:20:28.281 --> 02:20:32.220
<v Speaker 3>funny if some dude said this is my house now put a door in one of the top bulls.</v>

4946
02:20:32.230 --> 02:20:34.340
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes there are caretakers,</v>

4947
02:20:34.400 --> 02:20:36.440
<v Speaker 3>a t for these sacred sites.</v>

4948
02:20:36.650 --> 02:20:37.490
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

4949
02:20:37.550 --> 02:20:38.800
<v Speaker 3>so if they're heard,</v>

4950
02:20:38.801 --> 02:20:39.920
<v Speaker 3>hadn't believes right,</v>

4951
02:20:40.460 --> 02:20:41.710
<v Speaker 3>they just mowed down.</v>

4952
02:20:41.720 --> 02:20:42.271
<v Speaker 3>One of the,</v>

4953
02:20:42.271 --> 02:20:42.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4954
02:20:42.560 --> 02:20:45.890
<v Speaker 3>ancient Mayan temples are pyramids that was there.</v>

4955
02:20:45.920 --> 02:20:46.790
<v Speaker 3>It's like a really,</v>

4956
02:20:46.791 --> 02:20:48.080
<v Speaker 3>really old structure.</v>

4957
02:20:48.110 --> 02:20:48.351
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4958
02:20:48.351 --> 02:20:53.120
<v Speaker 3>I tend to the plotted down cause it was on private land just to use it for</v>

4959
02:20:53.121 --> 02:20:53.954
<v Speaker 3>limestone.</v>

4960
02:20:54.170 --> 02:20:54.800
<v Speaker 3>Good Crane.</v>

4961
02:20:54.800 --> 02:20:55.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4962
02:20:55.140 --> 02:20:56.150
<v Speaker 3>People are freaking out.</v>

4963
02:20:56.151 --> 02:20:56.361
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4964
02:20:56.361 --> 02:20:58.100
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck did you do?</v>

4965
02:20:59.060 --> 02:20:59.620
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4966
02:20:59.620 --> 02:21:00.021
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4967
02:21:00.021 --> 02:21:00.854
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

4968
02:21:02.180 --> 02:21:06.080
<v Speaker 3>there's a different feelings in the different societies about these things.</v>

4969
02:21:06.081 --> 02:21:06.321
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4970
02:21:06.321 --> 02:21:09.020
<v Speaker 3>the Taliban just destroyed a huge,</v>

4971
02:21:09.021 --> 02:21:09.780
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4972
02:21:09.780 --> 02:21:12.050
<v Speaker 3>a Buddhist sculpture,</v>

4973
02:21:12.051 --> 02:21:17.051
<v Speaker 3>which was a heritage type site that I had had been there for thousands of years</v>

4974
02:21:17.131 --> 02:21:18.890
<v Speaker 3>and probably the CIA pretending to be to tell.</v>

4975
02:21:18.890 --> 02:21:21.170
<v Speaker 3>But look what they did.</v>

4976
02:21:21.800 --> 02:21:22.640
<v Speaker 3>These fucks,</v>

4977
02:21:23.690 --> 02:21:24.530
<v Speaker 3>I didn't say that.</v>

4978
02:21:25.910 --> 02:21:26.743
<v Speaker 3>I didn't mean it</v>

4979
02:21:28.650 --> 02:21:28.940
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

4980
02:21:28.940 --> 02:21:29.420
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4981
02:21:29.420 --> 02:21:32.150
<v Speaker 3>I had to know at least that was the story that got out and it,</v>

4982
02:21:32.151 --> 02:21:33.050
<v Speaker 3>and it was sad,</v>

4983
02:21:33.080 --> 02:21:34.560
<v Speaker 3>but it was still most likely true.</v>

4984
02:21:34.580 --> 02:21:34.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4985
02:21:34.730 --> 02:21:36.020
<v Speaker 3>religious ideologies.</v>

4986
02:21:36.021 --> 02:21:38.840
<v Speaker 3>But gets people to do almost every really fucking crazy,</v>

4987
02:21:38.841 --> 02:21:40.730
<v Speaker 3>like it's either money or religious ideology,</v>

4988
02:21:41.120 --> 02:21:41.953
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4989
02:21:42.070 --> 02:21:44.450
<v Speaker 3>or we ideology in general negative ideology,</v>

4990
02:21:44.750 --> 02:21:45.800
<v Speaker 3>like we were talking about,</v>

4991
02:21:45.801 --> 02:21:47.510
<v Speaker 3>the Boston bombings were like,</v>

4992
02:21:48.110 --> 02:21:50.210
<v Speaker 3>you can't do that without ideology.</v>

4993
02:21:50.420 --> 02:21:55.010
<v Speaker 3>Like no one is able to do something like that without ideology because you have</v>

4994
02:21:55.011 --> 02:21:59.360
<v Speaker 3>to have something that allows you to think that that's the correct thing to do</v>

4995
02:21:59.480 --> 02:22:01.370
<v Speaker 3>and your ideology of hate.</v>

4996
02:22:02.710 --> 02:22:04.550
<v Speaker 3>Not all ideologies are bad,</v>

4997
02:22:05.060 --> 02:22:05.930
<v Speaker 3>but you don't,</v>

4998
02:22:06.050 --> 02:22:10.250
<v Speaker 3>you don't get really insane acts of faith like that without an ideology.</v>

4999
02:22:10.670 --> 02:22:11.503
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5000
02:22:12.460 --> 02:22:14.390
<v Speaker 3>Insane acts of terrorism either.</v>

5001
02:22:15.080 --> 02:22:16.250
<v Speaker 3>Both things come from,</v>

5002
02:22:16.280 --> 02:22:17.113
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5003
02:22:17.780 --> 02:22:18.740
<v Speaker 3>it's not always bad,</v>

5004
02:22:18.741 --> 02:22:19.700
<v Speaker 3>but it's tricky.</v>

5005
02:22:19.940 --> 02:22:23.690
<v Speaker 3>It's tricky when you just automatically subscribed to the patterns that are in</v>

5006
02:22:23.691 --> 02:22:24.460
<v Speaker 3>front of you.</v>

5007
02:22:24.460 --> 02:22:25.470
<v Speaker 3>We'd like be,</v>

5008
02:22:25.770 --> 02:22:26.680
<v Speaker 3>we like to be in patent.</v>

5009
02:22:26.740 --> 02:22:29.610
<v Speaker 3>It's like getting to that mild bullshit thing on the desktop.</v>

5010
02:22:29.640 --> 02:22:31.350
<v Speaker 3>We felt really comfortable,</v>

5011
02:22:31.351 --> 02:22:33.720
<v Speaker 3>like going down already tread paths.</v>

5012
02:22:33.880 --> 02:22:34.450
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

5013
02:22:34.450 --> 02:22:35.530
<v Speaker 5>it's really true.</v>

5014
02:22:35.740 --> 02:22:36.820
<v Speaker 5>And it's sad,</v>

5015
02:22:36.940 --> 02:22:37.331
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5016
02:22:37.331 --> 02:22:38.164
<v Speaker 5>that the,</v>

5017
02:22:38.350 --> 02:22:38.860
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5018
02:22:38.860 --> 02:22:39.520
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

5019
02:22:39.520 --> 02:22:44.050
<v Speaker 5>the more wide spread understanding of jihad as a holy war,</v>

5020
02:22:44.260 --> 02:22:45.040
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

5021
02:22:45.040 --> 02:22:50.040
<v Speaker 5>within the Muslim community is that it's something that they ego wages.</v>

5022
02:22:51.260 --> 02:22:52.093
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

5023
02:22:52.540 --> 02:22:53.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5024
02:22:53.350 --> 02:22:53.980
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5025
02:22:53.980 --> 02:22:54.813
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

5026
02:22:55.060 --> 02:23:00.060
<v Speaker 5>we engage with our ego basically somehow the soul and the ego is always in a</v>

5027
02:23:01.631 --> 02:23:05.650
<v Speaker 5>kind of a holy war with each other that,</v>

5028
02:23:05.800 --> 02:23:06.520
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5029
02:23:06.520 --> 02:23:11.520
<v Speaker 5>that we desired the one true spirit to win out and to,</v>

5030
02:23:12.610 --> 02:23:13.443
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5031
02:23:13.510 --> 02:23:18.510
<v Speaker 5>to have love saved the day and all these things to be a hero in life.</v>

5032
02:23:19.990 --> 02:23:20.650
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5037
02:23:23.670 --> 02:23:28.060
<v Speaker 5>I think part of why we're called to a call to life.</v>

5038
02:23:28.580 --> 02:23:28.780
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

5039
02:23:28.780 --> 02:23:29.221
<v Speaker 3>Well the,</v>

5040
02:23:29.221 --> 02:23:29.430
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

5041
02:23:29.430 --> 02:23:32.500
<v Speaker 3>the original term was supposed to be like a Wark and see your own vices,</v>

<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

5047
02:23:38.050 --> 02:23:43.050
<v Speaker 5>and it's a struggle to become a better person in the same way that a Ecri,</v>

5048
02:23:43.370 --> 02:23:45.980
<v Speaker 5>Israel means God wrestler,</v>

<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5052

<v Speaker 5>without engaging it somehow,</v>

<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5059
02:24:00.770 --> 02:24:02.330
<v Speaker 5>creative pursuit of it.</v>

5060
02:24:02.900 --> 02:24:03.733
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

5061
02:24:03.830 --> 02:24:04.610

5062
02:24:04.610 --> 02:24:06.590
<v Speaker 5>it's not real or tangible for us.</v>

5063

5081
02:24:37.720 --> 02:24:40.150
<v Speaker 3>we're just creating little computer babies.</v>

5082
02:24:40.870 --> 02:24:42.220
<v Speaker 3>That's how computers get made.</v>

5083
02:24:42.670 --> 02:24:43.503
<v Speaker 3>People create them.</v>

5084
02:24:43.930 --> 02:24:44.800
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

5085
02:24:45.100 --> 02:24:45.933
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

5086
02:24:46.240 --> 02:24:49.630
<v Speaker 3>It's a new form of intelligence that were living amongst,</v>

5087
02:24:49.690 --> 02:24:52.570
<v Speaker 3>are you going to download your consciousness into a computer when the time</v>

5088
02:24:52.571 --> 02:24:53.404
<v Speaker 3>comes?</v>

5089
02:24:53.570 --> 02:24:55.310
<v Speaker 5>We'll have to see what's available.</v>

5090
02:24:55.311 --> 02:24:56.144
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5091
02:24:56.420 --> 02:24:57.020
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5092
02:24:57.020 --> 02:24:58.940
<v Speaker 5>I love Martine's,</v>

5093
02:24:59.030 --> 02:24:59.780
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5094
02:24:59.780 --> 02:25:00.441
<v Speaker 5>response.</v>

5095
02:25:00.441 --> 02:25:01.111
<v Speaker 5>Cause I was saying,</v>

5096
02:25:01.111 --> 02:25:01.230
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

5097
02:25:01.230 --> 02:25:01.710
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

5098
02:25:01.710 --> 02:25:02.101
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

5099
02:25:02.101 --> 02:25:02.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5100
02:25:02.700 --> 02:25:05.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about a soul in a robot and stuff like that.</v>

5101
02:25:05.521 --> 02:25:05.860
<v Speaker 3>But she was,</v>

5102
02:25:05.860 --> 02:25:06.693
<v Speaker 5>it was saying like,</v>

5103
02:25:06.730 --> 02:25:08.950
<v Speaker 5>well who's to say that a soul,</v>

5104
02:25:08.990 --> 02:25:13.960
<v Speaker 5>if there were a disembodied spirit wouldn't like hanging around a,</v>

5105
02:25:13.970 --> 02:25:15.940
<v Speaker 5>a robot of itself,</v>

5106
02:25:16.120 --> 02:25:16.490
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5107
02:25:16.490 --> 02:25:16.730
<v Speaker 5>for</v>

5108
02:25:16.730 --> 02:25:19.940
<v Speaker 3>awhile or who's to say you're not going to create a Zombie in the next dimension</v>

5109
02:25:19.980 --> 02:25:21.500
<v Speaker 3>of the person's going to be born without a soul.</v>

5110
02:25:21.501 --> 02:25:23.150
<v Speaker 3>Cause he put it in somebody fucking computer.</v>

5111
02:25:23.620 --> 02:25:24.050
<v Speaker 3>And so then</v>

5112
02:25:24.050 --> 02:25:26.840
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden the next dimension is like the dotted debt.</v>

5113
02:25:26.870 --> 02:25:28.730
<v Speaker 1>You've got a bunch of zombies running around.</v>

5114
02:25:29.060 --> 02:25:30.140
<v Speaker 1>That could happen.</v>

5115
02:25:30.920 --> 02:25:32.540
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's the Zombie apocalypse,</v>

5116
02:25:32.580 --> 02:25:33.261
<v Speaker 1>apocalypse.</v>

5117
02:25:33.261 --> 02:25:36.440
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's where now we've seen the walking dead and this sort of thing.</v>

5118
02:25:36.441 --> 02:25:38.960
<v Speaker 1>This Zombie theme keeps returning over and over and over again.</v>

5119
02:25:39.170 --> 02:25:42.800
<v Speaker 1>That's a warning telling us not to download our consciousness to computers.</v>

5120
02:25:44.060 --> 02:25:45.290
<v Speaker 1>We already have.</v>

5121
02:25:45.560 --> 02:25:45.891
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5122
02:25:45.891 --> 02:25:46.310
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

5123
02:25:46.310 --> 02:25:47.660
<v Speaker 1>that's what Facebook is.</v>

5124
02:25:47.661 --> 02:25:48.441
<v Speaker 1>That's my space,</v>

5125
02:25:48.441 --> 02:25:48.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5126
02:25:48.920 --> 02:25:49.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5127
02:25:49.340 --> 02:25:49.671
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5128
02:25:49.671 --> 02:25:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Our town</v>

5129
02:25:50.220 --> 02:25:52.590
<v Speaker 5>where our Instagram or on Twitter,</v>

5130
02:25:52.620 --> 02:25:56.430
<v Speaker 5>all of these things are a virtual existence and uh,</v>

5131
02:25:56.431 --> 02:25:56.851
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5132
02:25:56.851 --> 02:25:59.370
<v Speaker 5>Wiki and various things like this.</v>

5133
02:25:59.371 --> 02:25:59.930
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

5134
02:25:59.930 --> 02:26:04.180
<v Speaker 5>they give people maybe a sense of solidity.</v>

5135
02:26:04.290 --> 02:26:04.800
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5136
02:26:04.800 --> 02:26:08.040
<v Speaker 1>that's why it's weird to go to someone's Twitter page after they're dead.</v>

5137
02:26:08.670 --> 02:26:09.660
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever done that before?</v>

5138
02:26:09.720 --> 02:26:10.381
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5139
02:26:10.381 --> 02:26:11.400
<v Speaker 1>but I'm page.</v>

5140
02:26:11.580 --> 02:26:12.450
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who,</v>

5141
02:26:12.451 --> 02:26:16.650
<v Speaker 1>a really great guy who a expired and every now and then I go to his Facebook</v>

5142
02:26:16.651 --> 02:26:19.030
<v Speaker 1>page and I'll read his posts and go,</v>

5143
02:26:19.470 --> 02:26:20.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5144
02:26:20.010 --> 02:26:21.030
<v Speaker 1>I keep reading this post.</v>

5145
02:26:21.031 --> 02:26:22.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm still getting a little bit of him.</v>

5146
02:26:22.650 --> 02:26:23.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5147
02:26:23.410 --> 02:26:26.610
<v Speaker 1>you watch a video of him getting a little bit of him,</v>

5148
02:26:26.970 --> 02:26:27.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5149
02:26:27.510 --> 02:26:28.560
<v Speaker 1>it's not new stuff.</v>

5150
02:26:28.590 --> 02:26:30.630
<v Speaker 1>I listened to ray man's Eric today.</v>

5151
02:26:30.780 --> 02:26:31.830
<v Speaker 1>He died today.</v>

5152
02:26:31.890 --> 02:26:32.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5153
02:26:32.400 --> 02:26:33.360
<v Speaker 1>But I listened to him.</v>

5154
02:26:33.390 --> 02:26:34.620
<v Speaker 1>He was like 72.</v>

5155
02:26:34.621 --> 02:26:35.454
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

5156
02:26:35.670 --> 02:26:36.600
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that crazy?</v>

5157
02:26:36.610 --> 02:26:38.010
<v Speaker 1>Then the doors,</v>

5158
02:26:38.100 --> 02:26:39.630
<v Speaker 1>he was in the doors and he's 72.</v>

5159
02:26:39.631 --> 02:26:39.901
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

5160
02:26:39.901 --> 02:26:40.461
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

5161
02:26:40.461 --> 02:26:42.210
<v Speaker 1>Warm the dirt going on.</v>

5162
02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:44.700
<v Speaker 1>How old are we getting Jesus?</v>

5163
02:26:44.910 --> 02:26:47.220
<v Speaker 1>While there's something timeless within that,</v>

5164
02:26:48.120 --> 02:26:50.670
<v Speaker 1>he downloaded himself into a computer right before we kicked off,</v>

5165
02:26:53.350 --> 02:26:56.450
<v Speaker 5>I think into all of our consciousness and uh,</v>

5166
02:26:56.590 --> 02:26:58.410
<v Speaker 5>and the computers are just a,</v>

5167
02:26:58.420 --> 02:26:58.810
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5168
02:26:58.810 --> 02:27:01.060
<v Speaker 5>the external storage devices.</v>

5169
02:27:01.180 --> 02:27:04.240
<v Speaker 5>What's really the cool thing is that we're connected with all of it.</v>

5170
02:27:04.390 --> 02:27:05.620
<v Speaker 5>Just consciousness wise.</v>

5171
02:27:05.980 --> 02:27:08.830
<v Speaker 1>What do you think the next stage of consciousness is going to be?</v>

5172
02:27:08.890 --> 02:27:10.450
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's going to be some sort of,</v>

5173
02:27:10.451 --> 02:27:11.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5174
02:27:11.170 --> 02:27:13.420
<v Speaker 1>an ability to read each other's minds,</v>

5175
02:27:13.421 --> 02:27:14.710
<v Speaker 1>to integrate with each other,</v>

5176
02:27:14.711 --> 02:27:16.780
<v Speaker 1>to exchange information freely through the air?</v>

5177
02:27:16.781 --> 02:27:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Like a Wifi signal?</v>

5178
02:27:18.310 --> 02:27:19.180
<v Speaker 1>What do you think it's going away?</v>

5179
02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:19.990
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5180
02:27:19.990 --> 02:27:20.620
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>

5181
02:27:20.620 --> 02:27:21.880
<v Speaker 1>All that it's coming right?</v>

5182
02:27:21.940 --> 02:27:22.773
<v Speaker 1>Can't stop it.</v>

5183
02:27:22.810 --> 02:27:24.550
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's a,</v>

5184
02:27:24.580 --> 02:27:25.840
<v Speaker 1>an inevitable,</v>

5185
02:27:25.960 --> 02:27:26.770
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

5186
02:27:26.770 --> 02:27:28.840
<v Speaker 5>evolutionary development.</v>

5187
02:27:28.841 --> 02:27:29.674
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>

5188
02:27:29.720 --> 02:27:30.220
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5189
02:27:30.220 --> 02:27:34.000
<v Speaker 5>some of it's going to take training and some of it's going to take an</v>

5190
02:27:34.030 --> 02:27:37.570
<v Speaker 5>orientation toward it and an opening up,</v>

5191
02:27:37.730 --> 02:27:38.070
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5192
02:27:38.070 --> 02:27:39.400
<v Speaker 5>a ideas of,</v>

5193
02:27:39.401 --> 02:27:40.040
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5194
02:27:40.040 --> 02:27:40.420
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5195
02:27:40.420 --> 02:27:41.500
<v Speaker 5>clairvoyants and,</v>

5196
02:27:41.680 --> 02:27:42.160
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5197
02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:44.530
<v Speaker 5>extra sensory perception and things like that,</v>

5198
02:27:45.140 --> 02:27:45.670
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5199
02:27:45.670 --> 02:27:46.271
<v Speaker 5>can,</v>

5200
02:27:46.271 --> 02:27:46.630
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5201
02:27:46.630 --> 02:27:47.590
<v Speaker 5>be trained,</v>

5202
02:27:47.800 --> 02:27:48.160
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5203

<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5205
02:27:49.420 --> 02:27:50.710
<v Speaker 5>to be enhanced.</v>

5206
02:27:51.300 --> 02:27:56.300
<v Speaker 1>I have a completely uneducated faith in the fact that people far smarter than me</v>

5207
02:27:57.210 --> 02:27:59.250
<v Speaker 1>are going to continue to do awesome work.</v>

5208
02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:00.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

5209
02:28:00.620 --> 02:28:04.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm convinced that they're going to continue to come out of school and figure</v>

5210
02:28:04.411 --> 02:28:05.310
<v Speaker 1>new things out,</v>

5211

<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

5215
02:28:07.980 --> 02:28:08.850
<v Speaker 1>we're really coming up.</v>

5216
02:28:08.851 --> 02:28:09.810
<v Speaker 1>What's really fast computers?</v>

5217
02:28:09.840 --> 02:28:10.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm not coming up with shit,</v>

5218

<v Speaker 1>So whoever you are out there,</v>
