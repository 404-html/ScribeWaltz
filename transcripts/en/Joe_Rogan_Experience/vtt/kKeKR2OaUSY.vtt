1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.500
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.340
<v Speaker 1>All he's doing is playing some really crazy game that was around before he was</v>

3
00:00:05.341 --> 00:00:06.174
<v Speaker 1>ever born.</v>

4
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.370
<v Speaker 1>He just got into it and got really good at it.</v>

5
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:08.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:09.690
<v Speaker 1>The game itself,</v>

7
00:00:09.691 --> 00:00:11.010
<v Speaker 1>it's bananas.</v>

8
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.630
<v Speaker 1>Just the stock market itself.</v>

9
00:00:12.631 --> 00:00:15.090
<v Speaker 1>Just the idea that the wealth of,</v>

10
00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:15.421
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

11
00:00:15.421 --> 00:00:20.421
<v Speaker 1>of a a person can vary day by day because of confidence,</v>

12
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.380
<v Speaker 1>confidence,</v>

14
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.190
<v Speaker 1>computer,</v>

15
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.710
<v Speaker 1>consumer confidence in a product can shift and change with Rico and then you</v>

16
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.710
<v Speaker 1>watching these numbers go up and down like what the fuck are you even talking</v>

17
00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:32.011
<v Speaker 1>about?</v>

18
00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:33.750
<v Speaker 1>Most of the explanations you see,</v>

19
00:00:33.751 --> 00:00:33.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:36.570
<v Speaker 1>I watched these business sites in the market will go down and they say,</v>

21
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.000
<v Speaker 1>oh mark it down because of such and such in London.</v>

22
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.770
<v Speaker 1>And then it's like by the time that piece comes out,</v>

23
00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:43.560
<v Speaker 1>that market's actually back up and they're already constructing their,</v>

24
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:46.860
<v Speaker 1>let's tie market going back up to another random feature.</v>

26
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.071
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

27
00:00:47.071 --> 00:00:47.731
<v Speaker 1>it's like the,</v>

28
00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:48.250
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

29
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.470
<v Speaker 1>the explanations after the fact have so little to do with whatever.</v>

30
00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:56.850
<v Speaker 1>Some algorithm decided it was going to suddenly ultra fast trade something and,</v>

31
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.140
<v Speaker 1>and throw the stock up.</v>

32
00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.471
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

33
00:00:58.471 --> 00:00:59.670
<v Speaker 1>it's like at this point it's,</v>

34
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.533
<v Speaker 1>it truly is.</v>

35
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.620
<v Speaker 1>That's the best place to see humans combating machines is on the marketing where</v>

36
00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:07.140
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's human traders competing with these,</v>

37
00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:10.800
<v Speaker 1>that programmed algorithms and the algorithms are certainly winning the war.</v>

38
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.080
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at their screens while they're,</v>

39
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.881
<v Speaker 1>while they're doing it,</v>

40
00:01:13.881 --> 00:01:15.330
<v Speaker 1>it is almost like code.</v>

41
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.790
<v Speaker 1>Like the average person who doesn't understand it,</v>

42
00:01:17.791 --> 00:01:19.980
<v Speaker 1>doesn't know what the fuck the stock market's saying,</v>

43
00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:21.390
<v Speaker 1>the symbols and the essay,</v>

44
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh and this and that and the ones and the Zeros.</v>

45
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.781
<v Speaker 1>You look at all that,</v>

46
00:01:24.781 --> 00:01:25.800
<v Speaker 1>you have no idea what that is.</v>

47
00:01:25.801 --> 00:01:25.981
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

48
00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:28.440
<v Speaker 1>how has that really different than a computer code that you're reading me?</v>

49
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.990
<v Speaker 1>That's essentially like a,</v>

50
00:01:29.991 --> 00:01:31.290
<v Speaker 1>a way that,</v>

51
00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:31.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

52
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.100
<v Speaker 1>people are,</v>

53
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.301
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

54
00:01:32.301 --> 00:01:32.520
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

55
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.850
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

56
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.800
<v Speaker 1>are tapping into this bizarre system.</v>

57
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.221
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

58
00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:40.110
<v Speaker 1>it was at one time this sort of the price of something it had to do with some</v>

59
00:01:40.111 --> 00:01:40.610
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

60
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:41.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

61
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a factory,</v>

62
00:01:42.061 --> 00:01:42.241
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

63
00:01:42.241 --> 00:01:44.150
<v Speaker 1>it's factory went slower today in the rain.</v>

64
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.420
<v Speaker 1>The market will go down on that.</v>

65
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:46.700
<v Speaker 1>So it was like real,</v>

66
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.100
<v Speaker 1>and it's gotten certainly further and further from whatever is going on in that</v>

68
00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:54.780
<v Speaker 1>company or their earnings are the things,</v>

69
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:55.470
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

71
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.950
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely abstracted to the point now where people don't even invest in</v>

72
00:01:58.951 --> 00:01:59.620
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>

73
00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.930
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

74
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:00.120
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

75
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.630
<v Speaker 1>You invest in something like when Facebook went public and people bought it at</v>

76
00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:04.700
<v Speaker 1>like nine in the morning,</v>

77
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:05.281
<v Speaker 1>like nine,</v>

78
00:02:05.281 --> 00:02:06.570
<v Speaker 1>10 they're all pissed off,</v>

79
00:02:06.571 --> 00:02:07.560
<v Speaker 1>but it hasn't gone up.</v>

80
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.251
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

81
00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:08.821
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

82
00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:11.010
<v Speaker 1>I was supposed to triple my,</v>

83
00:02:11.011 --> 00:02:11.640
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

84
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.090
<v Speaker 1>my wealth.</v>

85
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.331
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

86
00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:12.451
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

87
00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:13.050
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>

88
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.670
<v Speaker 1>You don't make money on the trade.</v>

89
00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:16.620
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to make money on when you've,</v>

90
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.311
<v Speaker 1>when you've done it.</v>

91
00:02:17.311 --> 00:02:17.941
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

92
00:02:17.941 --> 00:02:18.720
<v Speaker 1>now we've got,</v>

93
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.921
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

94
00:02:18.921 --> 00:02:19.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

95
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.740
<v Speaker 1>derivatives and derivatives of derivatives and derivatives of derivatives of</v>

96
00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:23.640
<v Speaker 1>derivatives on there,</v>

97
00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:28.020
<v Speaker 1>which is just a way of kind of shrinking the explainer for people don't know</v>

98
00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:28.621
<v Speaker 1>what that means.</v>

99
00:02:28.621 --> 00:02:30.060
<v Speaker 1>So if you buy a stock,</v>

100
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.331
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

101
00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:30.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

102
00:02:30.601 --> 00:02:31.321
<v Speaker 1>you buy stock in you,</v>

103
00:02:31.321 --> 00:02:33.270
<v Speaker 1>I hope it goes up and then you sell it in the future.</v>

104
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.660
<v Speaker 1>If you'd rather make up that time right now,</v>

105
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.910
<v Speaker 1>I can sell it in the future right now,</v>

106
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

107
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.140
<v Speaker 1>I can basically sell that future sale cause I think that sales is going to be a</v>

108
00:02:43.141 --> 00:02:44.610
<v Speaker 1>good one now,</v>

109
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.873
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

110
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:46.351
<v Speaker 1>I can say,</v>

111
00:02:46.351 --> 00:02:47.280
<v Speaker 1>what if I did that trait?</v>

112
00:02:47.281 --> 00:02:47.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm to,</v>

113
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.001
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to,</v>

114
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:48.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have it now,</v>

115
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.123
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

116
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.293
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

117
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.880
<v Speaker 1>so what am I trading then I'm trading,</v>

118
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:56.743
<v Speaker 1>I'm trading on,</v>

119
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.880
<v Speaker 1>on an abstraction from what something's to be worse at some in the future.</v>

120
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.570
<v Speaker 1>So it's like I'm trading on the stock over time and then someone else will say,</v>

121
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:04.751
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

122
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:06.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to trade on the abstraction of that.</v>

123
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to trade on whether or not people think the stock in the future is</v>

124
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:10.930
<v Speaker 1>going to be worth more next minute.</v>

125
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:12.250
<v Speaker 1>Then this minute it's like,</v>

126
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.330
<v Speaker 1>well what's that?</v>

127
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 1>So basically what you're doing is you're buying the stock over time,</v>

128
00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:17.501
<v Speaker 1>over time,</v>

129
00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:18.191
<v Speaker 1>over time,</v>

130
00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:19.000
<v Speaker 1>over time,</v>

131
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.530
<v Speaker 1>you're creating these things,</v>

132
00:03:20.531 --> 00:03:24.070
<v Speaker 1>these derivatives of whatever the original investment was,</v>

133
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.910
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of just a derivative of the thing because the pork belly,</v>

134
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:29.110
<v Speaker 1>this driven of the pork belly,</v>

135
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:30.100
<v Speaker 1>drifters of the derivatives,</v>

136
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.800
<v Speaker 1>derivatives of the derivatives of the derivatives and the derivatives all goof</v>

137
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.120
<v Speaker 1>ball ever tighter ways of saying what is pork belly going to be worth,</v>

138
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.223
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

139
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.750
<v Speaker 1>on February 3rd why is that illegal?</v>

140
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.231
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

141
00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:42.820
<v Speaker 1>it's legal because what it,</v>

142
00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.920
<v Speaker 1>because the economy requires it,</v>

143
00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:45.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

144
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.810
<v Speaker 1>We have a kind of money,</v>

145
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.291
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

146
00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:48.250
<v Speaker 1>That has a clock in it.</v>

147
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.280
<v Speaker 1>It's lent into existence and has to be paid back more than got lent out.</v>

148
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.740
<v Speaker 1>So our economy needs to expand by hook or by Crook.</v>

149
00:03:56.741 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Somehow it has to grow in order for it to survive.</v>

150
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.050
<v Speaker 1>That's just the way central currency works.</v>

151
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.130
<v Speaker 1>They need to find more surface area for the money,</v>

152
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.080
<v Speaker 1>more ways for people to buy stuff.</v>

153
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.550
<v Speaker 1>So instead of just having,</v>

154
00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:11.110
<v Speaker 1>there's not enough of a company to buy.</v>

155
00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:15.520
<v Speaker 1>So now we can bet on how that company is going to do in some future gut.</v>

156
00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:17.350
<v Speaker 1>We can bet on that or we can bet on that.</v>

157
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.071
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

158
00:04:18.071 --> 00:04:22.150
<v Speaker 1>But what we're really doing is trying to kind of compress all of this time right</v>

159
00:04:22.151 --> 00:04:24.820
<v Speaker 1>onto like the head of a pin so we can bet on that.</v>

160
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.350
<v Speaker 1>So I don't have to sit and wait,</v>

161
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

162
00:04:26.831 --> 00:04:29.740
<v Speaker 1>3000 years for Facebook to be worth something.</v>

163
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.320
<v Speaker 1>I can trade on his future worth now.</v>

164
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.380
<v Speaker 1>But the whole joke of that is people who are trading that way,</v>

165
00:04:35.381 --> 00:04:37.480
<v Speaker 1>there are these computers that are trading faster than them.</v>

166
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.430
<v Speaker 1>So I put in one of my super fast,</v>

167
00:04:39.431 --> 00:04:40.150
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>

168
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm derivative trade.</v>

169
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.490
<v Speaker 1>Goldman Sachs sees that order coming in on the computer.</v>

170
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.740
<v Speaker 1>They're so close to the exchange,</v>

171
00:04:47.741 --> 00:04:52.741
<v Speaker 1>they can execute an order before my order even goes through based on having seen</v>

172
00:04:52.901 --> 00:04:54.340
<v Speaker 1>that I was going to do what I'm going to do.</v>

173
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.070
<v Speaker 1>So they can literally trade in my future.</v>

174
00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:58.181
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

175
00:04:58.181 --> 00:04:59.410
<v Speaker 1>Well I am in their past.</v>

176
00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.861
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

177
00:04:59.861 --> 00:05:00.310
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

178
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.660
<v Speaker 1>that's digital time shifting.</v>

179
00:05:01.661 --> 00:05:02.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

180
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.640
<v Speaker 1>that sounds like it's cheating.</v>

181
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.570
<v Speaker 1>That's like someone like running a quick server and they're local and then you</v>

182
00:05:07.571 --> 00:05:08.920
<v Speaker 1>have like 150 paying.</v>

183
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.533
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

184
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.530
<v Speaker 1>That's bullshit.</v>

185
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.971
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

186
00:05:12.971 --> 00:05:14.250
<v Speaker 1>With the Solo Bullshit.</v>

187
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.270
<v Speaker 1>The irony of it is it's gotten so big,</v>

188
00:05:16.271 --> 00:05:16.421
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

189
00:05:16.421 --> 00:05:20.800
<v Speaker 1>Derivative trading is bigger than regular trading now so that the New York Stock</v>

190
00:05:20.801 --> 00:05:23.200
<v Speaker 1>Exchange actually just got bought.</v>

191
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.010
<v Speaker 1>The exchange itself got bought by its derivative exchange,</v>

192
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.890
<v Speaker 1>so it's almost just like the proof's in the pudding.</v>

193
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like the derivative owns the market at this point,</v>

194
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.550
<v Speaker 1>but that's when you get that.</v>

195
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.870
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

196
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.670
<v Speaker 1>how could the government even ever deny how incompetent they are?</v>

197
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.980
<v Speaker 1>Then they allowed that like that alone to like someone should just like have a</v>

198
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.100
<v Speaker 1>broadcast on national television,</v>

199
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.610
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

200
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.410
<v Speaker 1>you know one of those town hall sort of events where you sit down with the,</v>

201
00:05:52.411 --> 00:05:54.520
<v Speaker 1>the main people that run the country and go,</v>

202
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:56.140
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck are you allowing this?</v>

203
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.090
<v Speaker 1>How are you,</v>

204
00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 1>you not fix this?</v>

205
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.270
<v Speaker 1>Why would you ever try to do anything else before you fix this?</v>

206
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.220
<v Speaker 1>When they made the decision,</v>

207
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:06.470
<v Speaker 1>they genuinely thought it would be good for business.</v>

208
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.400
<v Speaker 1>Let it go,</v>

209
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.830
<v Speaker 1>let it in the short term.</v>

210
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.460
<v Speaker 1>I will never understand where it all close business people promise them,</v>

211
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.220
<v Speaker 1>figure it out before it got really bad.</v>

212
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.083
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

213
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.800
<v Speaker 1>we figure it out before it got really bad.</v>

214
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.500
<v Speaker 1>How much bigger is the derivative economy?</v>

215
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:23.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly.</v>

216
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:24.434
<v Speaker 1>I mean it seemed,</v>

217
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.200
<v Speaker 1>I was looking trying to find out what that,</v>

218
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:27.650
<v Speaker 1>what the sort of trading was.</v>

219
00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:32.651
<v Speaker 1>It seemed from what I could tell like 94% of trades are now derivative because</v>

220
00:06:34.431 --> 00:06:34.840
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

221
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:35.673
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

222
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.050
<v Speaker 1>because there's such bigger volumes.</v>

223
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:39.450
<v Speaker 1>God that's insane.</v>

224
00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.100
<v Speaker 1>No one's gonna like you're not going to buy,</v>

225
00:06:41.101 --> 00:06:41.301
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

226
00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:43.790
<v Speaker 1>10,000 chairs of Honeywell today cause that's,</v>

227
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

228
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:45.351
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

229
00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:46.610
<v Speaker 1>$60,000 or something.</v>

230
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.350
<v Speaker 1>But you could buy like 10,000 futures on Honeywell cause they're really cheap.</v>

231
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.870
<v Speaker 1>God that is so crazy.</v>

232
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.500
<v Speaker 1>4% of the stuff of trades are,</v>

233
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.270
<v Speaker 1>and how many more is,</v>

234
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.410
<v Speaker 1>I think it's ultra fast too is a whole other,</v>

235
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:04.700
<v Speaker 1>there's sort of two different,</v>

236
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:07.101
<v Speaker 1>two different realms.</v>

237
00:07:07.101 --> 00:07:07.461
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

238
00:07:07.461 --> 00:07:08.294
<v Speaker 1>it's huge.</v>

239
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.800
<v Speaker 1>They must all be crazy.</v>

240
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.250
<v Speaker 1>Everyone involved in that must know that they're bringing on the matrix.</v>

241
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.900
<v Speaker 1>They must know that they're there.</v>

242
00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:17.810
<v Speaker 1>They're the first steps before the digital machine takes over.</v>

243
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:18.853
<v Speaker 1>They must know.</v>

244
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:21.950
<v Speaker 1>They must know that there's no humanity in that stock market shit.</v>

245
00:07:21.951 --> 00:07:22.940
<v Speaker 1>That's chaos.</v>

246
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:24.103
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

247
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:24.860
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

248
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't want digital technology to get blamed for this,</v>

249
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:27.891
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

250
00:07:27.891 --> 00:07:30.080
<v Speaker 1>Because the real operating system they're promoting,</v>

251
00:07:30.081 --> 00:07:32.360
<v Speaker 1>it's not the digital operating system,</v>

252
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.730
<v Speaker 1>it's the economic operating system underneath it.</v>

253
00:07:34.731 --> 00:07:39.650
<v Speaker 1>It's this 13th century central currency interest bearing debt based economy.</v>

254
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:42.080
<v Speaker 1>And none of the guys who I thought would get us out,</v>

255
00:07:42.081 --> 00:07:42.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

256
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:43.880
<v Speaker 1>ev Williams with Twitter,</v>

257
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:45.140
<v Speaker 1>Mark Zuckerberg,</v>

258
00:07:45.141 --> 00:07:45.974
<v Speaker 1>with Facebook,</v>

259
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.120
<v Speaker 1>the kids from Google,</v>

260
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

261
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:48.530
<v Speaker 1>They're getting the,</v>

262
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.240
<v Speaker 1>each of them had a real shot.</v>

263
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:55.250
<v Speaker 1>Even Bill Gates at breaking the central economy and,</v>

264
00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.020
<v Speaker 1>and flipping things the other way.</v>

265
00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:58.260
<v Speaker 1>How do you go and do that?</v>

266
00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.180
<v Speaker 1>Going public,</v>

267
00:07:59.210 --> 00:07:59.831
<v Speaker 1>not be good,</v>

268
00:07:59.831 --> 00:08:02.810
<v Speaker 1>not doing it with venture capital saying if I can,</v>

269
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.230
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

270
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.600
<v Speaker 1>if Google can hack web search,</v>

271
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:07.850
<v Speaker 1>if Facebook can hack social,</v>

272
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:09.710
<v Speaker 1>if Twitter can hack everybody,</v>

273
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.353
<v Speaker 1>why can't they,</v>

274
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:12.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

275
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.050
<v Speaker 1>they're so busy disintermediating all these different things.</v>

276
00:08:15.051 --> 00:08:19.220
<v Speaker 1>Why doesn't anyone of them yet want to disintermediate central banking and say,</v>

277
00:08:19.221 --> 00:08:19.730
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

278
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:20.391
<v Speaker 1>Mr. Chase,</v>

279
00:08:20.391 --> 00:08:21.560
<v Speaker 1>we don't actually need you.</v>

280
00:08:21.561 --> 00:08:23.180
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do our whole thing through Kickstarter.</v>

281
00:08:23.181 --> 00:08:25.310
<v Speaker 1>Say like one of your didn't want to hear things.</v>

282
00:08:25.311 --> 00:08:25.540
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

283
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:26.373
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

284
00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.700
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting point of view.</v>

285
00:08:28.701 --> 00:08:31.970
<v Speaker 1>I think they probably would never want to take that stand because they would be</v>

286
00:08:31.971 --> 00:08:32.804
<v Speaker 1>killed.</v>

287
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:37.100
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine there's a lot of money and uh,</v>

288
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.790
<v Speaker 1>and in them not being successful with that quest,</v>

289
00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:41.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

290
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:44.840
<v Speaker 1>to control point at which,</v>

291
00:08:44.841 --> 00:08:45.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

292
00:08:45.021 --> 00:08:46.010
<v Speaker 1>you're doing paypal,</v>

293
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:46.311
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

294
00:08:46.311 --> 00:08:49.760
<v Speaker 1>we're going to let people do individual transactions that was there,</v>

295
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.640
<v Speaker 1>their original model and they were going to make money on the float.</v>

296
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:54.870
<v Speaker 1>And then the banks came to them and said,</v>

297
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

298
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:56.071
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowed to do that.</v>

299
00:08:56.071 --> 00:08:57.510
<v Speaker 1>You're not a bank paypal kids.</v>

300
00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:58.620
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be,</v>

301
00:08:58.620 --> 00:08:59.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

302
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.950
<v Speaker 1>can I just start as a bank or you're going to have to be connected to one of us.</v>

303
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:02.821
<v Speaker 1>And that's when,</v>

304
00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:03.121
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

305
00:09:03.121 --> 00:09:07.110
<v Speaker 1>paypal kind of becomes part of Ebay rather than whatever these crazy guys</v>

306
00:09:07.111 --> 00:09:07.591
<v Speaker 1>might've done.</v>

307
00:09:07.591 --> 00:09:09.330
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose there's this point,</v>

308
00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:10.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

309
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.180
<v Speaker 1>where you know,</v>

310
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.470
<v Speaker 1>innocently these companies that get bigger and bigger and bigger,</v>

311
00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:14.520
<v Speaker 1>hoping to do the right things,</v>

312
00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:15.354
<v Speaker 1>and then it's like,</v>

313
00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:17.480
<v Speaker 1>we're going to,</v>

314
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.460
<v Speaker 1>we're going to let you do this if you don't,</v>

315
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.170
<v Speaker 1>if you don't play by our rules.</v>

316
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:22.831
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

317
00:09:22.831 --> 00:09:23.664
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

318
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:25.500
<v Speaker 1>I also feel like there's companies that,</v>

319
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:26.070
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

320
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:28.050
<v Speaker 1>if you're willing to go smaller,</v>

321
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.720
<v Speaker 1>if you're willing to let it grow a little bit slower,</v>

322
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.490
<v Speaker 1>that you can scale up,</v>

323
00:09:32.491 --> 00:09:36.030
<v Speaker 1>but you can become a big ethical corporation.</v>

324
00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:36.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

325
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:41.840
