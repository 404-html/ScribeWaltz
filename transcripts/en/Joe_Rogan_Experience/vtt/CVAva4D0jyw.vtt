1
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.510
Is that it never know how to start these things done.
My Rara,
Hey Joe Rogan.

2
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.600
What's up my brother?
I know it's thinking comedy team for us.

3
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.400
Let me just go Starsky and hutch kind of a thing and I rarer,
he's wacky.

4
00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:20.090
I'm whack year.
What do you think I can,

5
00:00:20.091 --> 00:00:24.040
we have a wife that like always wins.
I can't here my,

6
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.140
there's something wrong with this headphone,
Brian.
Is that it?
Check it.
Check it.

7
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.280
Check it.
Okay.
There it goes.
I found the volume.
There's something fucked with it.

8
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.140
Yeah.
Um,
could we have like I'm talking to wives that always win.
Yeah,

9
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.060
that'd be great.
Writing and talking dog.
A talking dog.
That's bold.

10
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.940
Like how about an alien?
Remember when they had,
what was that alf?

11
00:00:43.941 --> 00:00:47.330
It was about the show.
They had a talking fucking my favorite Martian,

12
00:00:47.331 --> 00:00:51.520
but he was like a normal guy from Morris eat cats or something crazy like that,

13
00:00:51.521 --> 00:00:54.950
that he wanted to eat cats all the time.
Do you know the real total jerk?

14
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.890
It's actually really funny when you think about it.
Do you know the real guy?

15
00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.180
The father,
the father?

16
00:00:59.181 --> 00:01:02.120
And that show ended up he went when he was one that I like.
Blowed derelicts.

17
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.650
What?
Did you ever hear that?
No.
Nope.

18
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.220
I hope I'm right about this information cause I'd hate to ruin somebody's

19
00:01:07.221 --> 00:01:11.480
reputation.
He used to lick the bloat like a street people.
Whoa.

20
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.240
I know that's a little,
that could be high risk.

21
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.270
Holy Shit is this is a way to start this beautiful way to start the show.

22
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.620
We haven't even done the commercial.
A flashlight.
I love it.

23
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.680
I've got to someone figure out how to do with these fleshlight commercials in a

24
00:01:24.681 --> 00:01:29.170
different way and after you'd done it 200 times,
there's no way the fleshlight.

25
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.080
Yeah,
this is,

26
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.020
this is a commercial right now they're term beginning the terrific product.

27
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.510
Have you used one dime?
I rarer all the time.
Really?

28
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.610
Every day they're pretty good.
I'll tell you all that.

29
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.710
Better than masturbate Beth and masturbating.
I choked on my words.

30
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.340
That's how excited I got about it.

31
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.650
Better than masturbating broking and shit.

32
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.070
Your throat started coming choke.
I gagged.

33
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.590
Anyway,
go to Joe rogan.net.

34
00:01:54.591 --> 00:01:57.230
Click on the link for the flashlight and her in the code name.

35
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.090

36
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.780
We are also brought to you by onnit.com o n n I t,

37
00:02:05.781 --> 00:02:08.690
makers of Alpha brain and shroom tech sport,

38
00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:12.040
which is completely unnecessary for Brian because Brian is like,

39
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.970
he's just not into pushing it.
You're the opposite of shroom Tech Sport,
right?

40
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.940
You need to like shroom tech lutes each room tech sleep.

41
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.250
You have sleeping pills yet.
That'd be awesome.

42
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.580
We'll just get take some Melatonin.
You don't have a High Libido,
Huh?

43
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.310
I don't even know what that means.
Do you?
Does your Dick get hard often?
Oh yeah,

44
00:02:29.311 --> 00:02:34.160
yeah.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I don't have a high libido.
He's,

45
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.260
he's a little bit of a pervert I believe.

46
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.660
<v 2>Yeah.
I found out last night on the podcast that I,</v>

47
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.030
you know how you have that joke about the calm in the front of your shirt?
Yes.

48
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.030
I also have that happen all the time and I was saying and like how one of my,

49
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.810
my laundry is one out of four shirts.
If I look at it,

50
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.220
it has the come crystals all over it,
right.
And I sit in front of Dana Dearman,

51
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.450
Doug Benson and Lexie Bell and all of them thought I was psycho.
They're like,

52
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.520
that's,
I've never heard of a guy.

53
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.400
Hardcore fisting everything.
Like it's Oh so still find that repulsive.

54
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.880
So you guys agree with me,
right?
You'll,
you'll have shirts that you look down.

55
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:11.470
You're like shit,
I was that sloppy.
Hey,

56
00:03:11.471 --> 00:03:13.540
I had a time I was going to play basketball.

57
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.830
<v 3>It was like a Saturday morning and I forgot that I had put in like a toilet</v>

58
00:03:16.831 --> 00:03:18.840
paper all over my stomach and all from jerking though.

59
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:21.950
<v 4>Wait,
it was so embarrassing.</v>

60
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.183
<v 5>I get,</v>

61
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.320
<v 3>well I get up and I,
and a good Dan,</v>

62
00:03:25.321 --> 00:03:29.100
I just like maybe had something to eat real late and I'm walking out with a

63
00:03:29.101 --> 00:03:32.610
friend of mine and he came to pick me up walking down to the gym and I take off

64
00:03:32.611 --> 00:03:34.740
my shirt cause so fucking on it.
And there's a little toilet paper

65
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.510
<v 4>almost to my neck,
right?
And Oh,
what the fuck.
So I go,</v>

66
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.160
<v 5>Geez,
never mind</v>

67
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:49.840
<v 3>the matter of friend,
oh,</v>

68
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.310
that he came in the house was going to go out and have a beer with them.

69
00:03:53.311 --> 00:03:55.820
When we're all living together and I hear him go,

70
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.840
<v 5>oh,
oh,</v>

71
00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.973
<v 3>different parts of acid.</v>

72
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.120
I think he's walking around the house with his pants down,
jerking off next day.

73
00:04:03.121 --> 00:04:06.690
I'm like,
bet the basketball court,
and he comes up and he goes,

74
00:04:06.691 --> 00:04:10.350
didn't you hear me last night?
I go,
yeah,
I fucking hurt you.
He goes,

75
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.550
I broke my nose and he bent down and broke his nose.
I said,
wow,
thank God.

76
00:04:14.551 --> 00:04:15.384
I thought you were joking.

77
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.680
<v 5>Oh,
what a relief.
What a similar sound.
Oh,
it's very similar.</v>

78
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:24.860
Oh yeah.
That broke nose feeling.

79
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.990
Oh fuck.
Anyway,
[inaudible] Dot com o,

80
00:04:29.991 --> 00:04:33.080
n n,
I t,
makers of Alpha brain,
Trump tech sport,

81
00:04:33.081 --> 00:04:36.200
which was the stuff that I was talking about,
took four of them last night.

82
00:04:36.201 --> 00:04:40.760
Time are rare.
You feel shit out of that heavy bag,
son.
Get that bag.

83
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.450
Medicaid.
Shoot.
Your bags are a beautiful thing.
If you don't have a heavy bag,

84
00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.810
if you can have a heavy bag and yet you're silly,
get,
get one of those things.

85
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.150
It's like the best stress reliever all time.

86
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.260
<v 3>No.
Imagine what would have happened if the,</v>

87
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.070
what you just went through when you were younger and less than much more

88
00:04:56.071 --> 00:04:56.904
volatile.

89
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.830
<v 5>What I just went through your head if he didn't have a family and peace with</v>

90
00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:00.940
yourself and the whole thing.

91
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.790
There's a lot of nonsense in this world down my work could be worth that guy.

92
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.230
How did he know who he was fucking with?
People are,

93
00:05:08.231 --> 00:05:12.850
so we're just talking about dudes giving dudes the finger or whatever in the

94
00:05:12.851 --> 00:05:16.240
car.
Like road rage all the time.
It's just so common and it's so silly.

95
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.430
Like people,
you know,
if someone gets in front of you like,

96
00:05:18.431 --> 00:05:21.010
why are you really that upset?
You really going to give me the finger.

97
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.160
That's the thing.
We were like,
that hurts too.
Hey,
silly.
Like what kind of uh,

98
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.340
kind of a man does that?
Brian,

99
00:05:27.341 --> 00:05:30.370
tell me when you're telling me you're almost eyes and shit.

100
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.510
Why is that shit your man like Dylan,

101
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.570
<v 2>angry guy that takes too much supplements before going to Jujitsu.</v>

102
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.590
Could think of.
He's getting ready for combat.
Yeah,
he's in war.
That's what it is.

103
00:05:40.591 --> 00:05:42.690
He's in that frame of mind.
Yeah.
Anyway,

104
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.770
<v 3>I don't like the idea of seeing myself,
by the way.
I forget what I look for.</v>

105
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.370
<v 5>I really do.
I forget that.
I get that.
I'm like starting to look Mongolian.</v>

106
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.260
Yeah,
we talked about this last time,
a hint of venue.

107
00:05:57.261 --> 00:05:59.780
It is,
I think how we described it.
I don't like saying it.

108
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.250
I don't believe it's real good.
Cue The music,

109
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.000
<v 6>Brian.
Oh yeah.
And we're in the code name rogue and Blah Blah Blah.</v>

110
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:07.970
Shroom tech sport.
Uh,
it's just stuff that we were talking about.

111
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.840
Alpha brain is another cognitive enhancing supplement that I didn't take before

112
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:14.120
the show.
So hopefully I won't suffer.
I'm going to take one.

113
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.780
I'm gonna have to pull one out in the middle of a good story.
Jody.
Yeah,

114
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.610
<v 5>the list of questions I want you to ask me so I get they get back with me.</v>

115
00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:24.520
Zinger.
So Dom,
I understand you just got back from the zoo.

116
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.840
What are you should say that Joe,

117
00:06:25.841 --> 00:06:28.330
you wouldn't believe all the funny things that happened to be at the zoo today.

118
00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.580
<v 6>Go to [inaudible] dot com o n n I t enter in the code name Brogan.</v>

119
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.400
Save yourself 10%.
We will have the kettle bells available this week and,
uh,

120
00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.500
all information about that soon to follow.

121
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.990
<v 5>All right.
Hello.
Hits music.</v>

122
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.180
<v 7>The Joe Rogan experience.
Joe Rogan podcast my night.</v>

123
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.370
Wow.
He's got a new fate every time.
The kid,

124
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.580
just when you think he can't just,
he can't add a different flair.

125
00:06:58.581 --> 00:06:59.930
There's no more flares to add.

126
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.420
<v 5>Just retired on Martha bottom over here.</v>

127
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.190
I get so much good feedback.
Calling you a retard.
It's the,

128
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.230
it's the cool thing to do.
Well,
um,
Brian is

129
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.920
<v 6>lightly playing a character on the show,
ladies and gentlemen.
It's,
it's subtle.</v>

130
00:07:14.921 --> 00:07:19.280
It goes in and out.
Even,
I don't know when it's there,
I can,

131
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:20.870
I don't record it.
Recognize

132
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.310
<v 5>it,
but uh,
uh,
but he balances me out.</v>

133
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.070
Yeah.
No,
you guys are the Yin and Yang of life.

134
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.080
That's what we've been trying to form a new band and that's what it was going to

135
00:07:33.081 --> 00:07:37.820
be called.
We guys are getting the hang of getting Yang twins hook.

136
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.490
Yeah.
We would have to go to war with the Yin Yang twins.

137
00:07:40.491 --> 00:07:43.280
They would kick our ass for,
for Jack in their name.
No,

138
00:07:43.281 --> 00:07:45.260
we could copyright that shit cause they don't have a podcast.

139
00:07:45.261 --> 00:07:47.570
We do a podcast first called the Yin Yang twins and then we,

140
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:51.620
the union since podcast,
that seems unscrupulous.
I had no idea.
This is fun.

141
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.890
I didn't know I did.
The show is just this fucking big.
I swear to God.

142
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.700
I mean it's amazing how much Chicago people coming up to me.
What God can't.

143
00:07:58.701 --> 00:08:01.910
They came to the show,
he goes,
man,
you know,
I didn't really hear you before,

144
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.940
but you went,
you did the podcast,
you'll and Rogan.
We're so fucking funny.

145
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:08.630
I had the government go,
Holy Shit.
You know what I mean?
Like I,
I did the show.

146
00:08:08.631 --> 00:08:11.350
Not like I felt like I was doing you a favor,
but you gotta show.

147
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.340
Of course I want to do it.
You know what I mean?
It's like,

148
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:16.640
but you didn't think that that many people are going to,
I had no fucking clue.

149
00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:20.240
I'm so retarded.
You don't know what the real numbers are right now.
Probably.

150
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.030
It's pretty high though.
And it,

151
00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:27.060
what it is though is the difference is they're with you for hours at a time and

152
00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:30.690
their comedy people.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Did calm me.
That's a big difference.
Yeah.

153
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:34.250
Because what I like late night shows,
nobody gives a fuck.
Right.

154
00:08:34.251 --> 00:08:36.110
You know what I mean?
It's hard to do.
You don't,

155
00:08:36.111 --> 00:08:38.960
you feel when you do a late night show that you don't even get a chance to

156
00:08:38.961 --> 00:08:39.794
really get cooking.

157
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:43.880
You're doing like five minutes or something like that or seven minutes.
Ah,
man,

158
00:08:43.881 --> 00:08:47.720
I can't do it.
I just,
my my mind doesn't function like that for a set.

159
00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:52.580
It's really hard to pull off and get a true feeling of what the experience of

160
00:08:52.581 --> 00:08:55.980
seeing someone live it.
But you like,
like I like just to do some stuff

161
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.960
<v 3>that's just improvisation.
Yeah,
fuck around.</v>

162
00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:02.970
And the most fun I ever had was on Craig Ferguson when he introduced me and gave

163
00:09:02.971 --> 00:09:05.530
me the wrong credit.
He said that he,

164
00:09:05.531 --> 00:09:08.460
you can see diamond to Denver comedy works this week.
I said,
thanks a lot.

165
00:09:08.461 --> 00:09:10.470
What a cracked stab you have.
I was there last week,

166
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:14.460
but I'm so hot in a business I have to post plug things with a place will be

167
00:09:14.461 --> 00:09:17.730
stormed.
Right.
And then he said,
well let's just start it over.

168
00:09:17.731 --> 00:09:19.350
He came out on stage of God.
I'm starting over.

169
00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:22.470
I got a spot at the laugh factory later.
I can't,
I don't have this kind of time.

170
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.160
But that was fun cause it was real.
You can't do that every time.

171
00:09:26.161 --> 00:09:30.700
But it's tough to have enough time to fuck around is odd.
You know,

172
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.340
most of the times it's like,
it's so rigid.
Oh start with your first pit.

173
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:38.490
It just so fucking Corny at the desk.
And like we were just saying about the zoo.

174
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.840
ASB,
ASB.
This are very,
yeah,

175
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.040
I mean it's cool when someone has a good story,
you know,

176
00:09:44.041 --> 00:09:46.680
and he gets some nick naulty character.
It's got some crazy story,

177
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.210
but for the most part of your,
you're accepting a contrived conversation.
Yeah.

178
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:54.930
I mean,
I saw an actress on one of the shows.
I said I couldn't watch it,

179
00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:58.410
but that's some of the most boring fucking TV there is.
And Letterman said,

180
00:09:58.411 --> 00:10:01.830
really?
They just want to see you.
In other words,
you're so fucking vapid.

181
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.070
Just sit here.
Don't even worry about talking.
You know what I mean?

182
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:08.670
I'll do the talk and just sit there because you have nothing to offer.

183
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:12.210
Has Kim Kardashian never been on Letterman?
I Dunno

184
00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:16.570
<v 1>what talk shows you she been on.
She has to be on everything,
right?
I don't know.</v>

185
00:10:16.571 --> 00:10:18.880
I've never seen her interviewed.
It's one of the things that I was,

186
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:22.120
I was marveling at one day.
I was like,
I don't think I know her voice.

187
00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:26.110
She's been in the Lamar Odom big cock show.
I don't any,
I don't think I,
if if,

188
00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:30.040
if her,
the character playing her voice was substituted with a new character.

189
00:10:30.041 --> 00:10:32.140
I don't know if I would be able to pick it out.
I was like,

190
00:10:32.141 --> 00:10:35.350
it's amazing that she became like super famous without me.

191
00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:38.650
I mean like in my world,
like I know who she is on a regular basis,

192
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:42.430
but without me ever hearing her talk,
that's,
that's it.
That's incredible.

193
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:46.000
I might've heard like one or two of the commercials or something like that or

194
00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.240
maybe I'm watched one,
one episode of the show.
But you know what I'm saying?

195
00:10:49.241 --> 00:10:53.590
Like if,
if somebody tried to replace Your Voice,
I'll go,
that's not done.

196
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.360
My rarer,
I know what he sounds like.

197
00:10:55.361 --> 00:10:57.130
If someone tried to do Jeff Goldbloom and this,

198
00:10:57.131 --> 00:11:00.290
I know what Jeff Goldbloom sounds like,
but,
but I hear your rhythm,

199
00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:05.290
letterman's voice sounds like,
I don't know what her voice sounds on Letterman.

200
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.620
Like you could dump this with a completely different person,

201
00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:14.050
but she's is famous is like,
what's the chick's name from friends?

202
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.510
Jennifer Aniston.
Jennifer Aniston,
whose,

203
00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:20.170
whose voice is like extremely well known.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

204
00:11:20.171 --> 00:11:25.171
Like Jennifer Anderson is very specific and accomplished actress you exactly

205
00:11:25.391 --> 00:11:29.280
like,
it's amazing how famous she has gotten with very little words.
One,

206
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:31.800
if I want just a kid and she's getting married and was that exciting?

207
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:36.340
That could be a totally fake voice and I wouldn't know.

208
00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:40.390
It can sound nothing like what she sounds like Maria Brantford could be doubling

209
00:11:40.391 --> 00:11:41.224
her voice.

210
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:46.500
It's amazing how far a human being can go in the world of fame without ever

211
00:11:46.631 --> 00:11:51.280
saying anything.
Well,
don't you think like,
you know,
a lot of good or Brian Alien.

212
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:54.100
I said it doesn't in this house because she's

213
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.590
<v 7>the actresses.
Rather Brittany was here the other day.</v>

214
00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:01.530
What did you maybe even spread around?
Red Brown could nightmare is a nice kid.

215
00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:05.620
She's demonically possessed.
This is actually in coder.

216
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:09.250
He's got a secret decoder ring and now it's the ciphering.

217
00:12:09.251 --> 00:12:13.210
What her real voice actually is before Lucifer's powers.

218
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.500
Oh,
that's scary.
The freakiest shit.

219
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:22.620
Why is that demonic once a shitty rule for yourself?
Oh,

220
00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:23.710
I went to Africa.
This

221
00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:31.390
empowerment finds sent me and my sister and um,
my boyfriend and,

222
00:12:31.391 --> 00:12:35.690
and we just went to Botswana and it was really cool.

223
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.740
Just see how other diamonds really help the country out there.
Wait a minute

224
00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:46.440
back.
Holy Shit.
Holy Shit.

225
00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:51.540
What the fuck does she just say that diamond?
Oh my God.

226
00:12:51.541 --> 00:12:56.280
That was hilarious.
Holy Shit.
No idea.
Life is not real.

227
00:12:56.281 --> 00:13:00.030
I'm telling you diamond empowerment,
it's a fucking Coen brothers movie.

228
00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:05.330
Um,
my boyfriend and we just went to Botswana and um,

229
00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:09.690
it was really cool to see how all the diamonds really help the country out
there.

230
00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:15.020
I am thinking that people are going to applaud,
right,
right.

231
00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.640
No conception of,
of what was going on there.

232
00:13:17.641 --> 00:13:20.930
And so every year I like to go on a vacation out of the country.
Yes.

233
00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.790
<v 8>That's good to get out and see what's going on.
But to see,
I,
uh,</v>

234
00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:27.480
had and the believe I'm ignorant in most matters,
uh,

235
00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.480
a different impression that the,
that the diamond industry,
uh,

236
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:36.420
maybe on a global stage was generating huge sums of money,

237
00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.270
but locally in these countries where they were mine,

238
00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.610
that the people were being exploited.
Did you,
did you,

239
00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.880
<v 7>that's what I assumed before I went there.</v>

240
00:13:43.881 --> 00:13:46.640
And so that's kind of why I wanted to go.
And it's completely the opposite.

241
00:13:46.641 --> 00:13:50.090
These diamonds fund,
the schools and the hospitals,

242
00:13:50.091 --> 00:13:51.830
they fun pretty much the entire country.

243
00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:57.130
But I was a little bit just the plan and Africa because I wanted to go see some

244
00:13:57.501 --> 00:14:00.890
wildlife animals and it's like this 24 hour flight.

245
00:14:00.891 --> 00:14:05.891
I was so excited to see like giraffes and animals like lions and I saw a few

246
00:14:06.111 --> 00:14:06.591
cubs,

247
00:14:06.591 --> 00:14:11.591
but when I get home off of the 24 hour flight in Calabasas,

248
00:14:11.631 --> 00:14:12.380
California,

249
00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:16.370
my sister and I are driving into my mom's house and the neighbor is having a

250
00:14:16.371 --> 00:14:18.110
little party with giraffes.

251
00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:23.890
We flew 24 hours all the way to Africa to see giraffes,
wild dressed,

252
00:14:23.891 --> 00:14:24.770
do not see a thing.

253
00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.320
We go to Calabasas and they're having a birthday party where they hire giraffe.

254
00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:34.710
We're,
we're working to get the draft.
How do you get them?

255
00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.650
Um,
well,

256
00:14:36.651 --> 00:14:41.160
I rented a monkey for my mom for a week because she was missing it.

257
00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:45.770
Should that be?
Yes,
the material.

258
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:50.930
It's funny Joe.
Oh my God,
I forgot.

259
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:51.913
Good animal stuff.

260
00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:57.410
<v 1>Wow.
Does this,
she have a point.</v>

261
00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.540
I'm really stoned from watching.
Does she have any point at all?
I mean,

262
00:15:02.541 --> 00:15:03.360
maybe she does.

263
00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.660
<v 3>Point was that the diamonds are good for you.</v>

264
00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.800
<v 1>Pay for the hospitals.
That's what she's saying.
I don't know.
Maybe they do.</v>

265
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:14.400
And you know,
you can't do that and still exploit children.

266
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:19.860
If you had to fucking dap,
Kardashians or Anacin which one?
Um,

267
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:24.120
I bet Jennifer Aniston knows how to throw it down.
Yeah,

268
00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:26.160
I would imagine she knows how to throw it down.

269
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.300
<v 3>Uh,
if you could cut off her head and switch the bodies,</v>

270
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.160
which one credential,
if you can comprehend,
why would you want to cough?

271
00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.290
<v 1>Want to cover?
She's really pretty</v>

272
00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.150
rapid that,
uh,
like,
I mean,
I think she really cares.

273
00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:45.240
<v 3>She's watching this.
Whether or not I'd want to fuck her.</v>

274
00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:50.210
Jennifer Ryan is probably,
I think Jennifer has to be more fun.
Yeah,
for sure.

275
00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:53.580
I think,
I dunno,
I dunno.
Was Kim Kardashian?

276
00:15:53.581 --> 00:15:56.650
It does have a porno with a black dude.
That's a chick that's willing to go deep.

277
00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.540
That's why I think Jennifer Harris,
it'd be great.

278
00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:04.780
<v 1>You can't fail to disappoint or,
exactly.
That's right.</v>

279
00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:07.900
You know?
Um,
whatever.

280
00:16:07.901 --> 00:16:12.160
What kind of conversations would you fuck Jennifer Aniston or,
well,

281
00:16:12.161 --> 00:16:16.470
how did it even get under her?
Oh,
it was like Jen fanish voice.

282
00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.440
That's what we're telling you about.

283
00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:22.300
It's fucking hard out there for a check checks trying to be famous,
you know,

284
00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:24.010
if she was doing the same thing,

285
00:16:24.011 --> 00:16:28.120
that if Kim Kardashian was a god though and she was doing what she's doing,

286
00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.480
like she would be like,
uh,
especially for the marriage part.

287
00:16:31.481 --> 00:16:36.040
Like she married [inaudible] 72 hours to that basketball player,
right?
Yeah.
Well,

288
00:16:36.041 --> 00:16:38.770
how long was she married for?
I think it was a month or something like that,

289
00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:41.920
but whatever it was,
you know,

290
00:16:41.921 --> 00:16:46.921
it's like to shame they did date the do that and you do it as like a piece of,

291
00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:49.840
it's a plot.
It's like this is her life.

292
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:54.330
All of a sudden become theater and they start introducing false things like

293
00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:55.780
false marriages,

294
00:16:55.781 --> 00:17:00.781
like hire some other high profile guy to come in and marry her on the show and

295
00:17:01.181 --> 00:17:04.690
then they break up and wow.
Is that what they're doing is,

296
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.340
because if it is what they're doing,
it's pretty brilliant.
It's,
if,

297
00:17:07.341 --> 00:17:09.130
if you think about what she's done,
I mean,

298
00:17:09.131 --> 00:17:13.570
just tactically the way she sort of entered into the entertainment industry,

299
00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.720
like a lot of people get mad.
They say she's Vapid,
she's this and that.

300
00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.250
But what she is is she's,

301
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.940
she's been super successful and getting people to pay attention to her.

302
00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:25.240
I mean it's,
it's fucking incredible.
I mean it's,

303
00:17:25.241 --> 00:17:29.860
it's amazing what you can pull off when you were single minded and you pursue

304
00:17:29.861 --> 00:17:33.080
that and you know,
he'd do it the way she's done it and obviously you're,

305
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:34.270
you look like her.

306
00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:35.403
<v 3>Yeah.
You know what,</v>

307
00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.990
you know what it reminded me of going back when you in when this kind of point

308
00:17:37.991 --> 00:17:42.991
hits you is when the Oj trial and Keto Kaylen went out and did comedy for a

309
00:17:43.471 --> 00:17:45.790
while.
And for that one moment in time,

310
00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:50.070
he was more famous than almost any of the comedians.
You right at the

311
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.570
<v 6>top of the Oj trial Kato,</v>

312
00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:56.571
Kaitlyn was selling out the MGM and he was trying to do comedy.

313
00:17:56.790 --> 00:18:01.620
Yeah,
he did stand up.
Did he do it before?
No.
No.
Oh,
that's horrible.
Oh yeah.

314
00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:06.000
Well Charlie Sheen.
Yeah.
Charlie Sheen.
Well,
you know who did that?

315
00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:09.120
Who's got fucking balls?
I've talked about it before,
but Charlie Murphy.

316
00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:13.920
Charlie Murphy.
Oh,
I know.
I didn't have a lot going on like as far as his career.

317
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:18.150
And then got on the Chappelle show and he was in his forties and then started

318
00:18:18.151 --> 00:18:21.250
doing standup and he was famous.
And not only is he famous,

319
00:18:21.251 --> 00:18:25.740
he was famous of white,
was the brother of one of the greatest standups ever.

320
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:28.680
So he's got Charlie Murphy,
his brothers,
Eddie Murphy.

321
00:18:28.681 --> 00:18:33.480
They look alike and you know,
I mean he's,
he's going out there literally,

322
00:18:33.481 --> 00:18:37.830
he's done comedy for like a couple of months and he had a close headline that's

323
00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:42.540
unbelievable.
He's got balls,
that guy has fucking balls.

324
00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:47.480
We did a month maximum tour on the road together.
And uh,

325
00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.600
Charlie Murphy,
man,
he,
he,
he's got fucking balls.
That guy,

326
00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:56.340
we would alternate headline and he don't even do the common follow you.
He did.

327
00:18:56.370 --> 00:19:00.660
He did a couple times.
What did he do well,
yeah,
my people,
first of all,

328
00:19:00.661 --> 00:19:05.310
he's a good storyteller and,
and people love him.
And if he's in his right groove,

329
00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:07.830
he,
it,
he's just got to be comfortable,
you know,

330
00:19:07.831 --> 00:19:09.420
when Charlie's comfortable and he's comfortable in.

331
00:19:09.421 --> 00:19:12.000
So he's got like a couple of different gears,
you know,

332
00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.130
and when he's comfortable and he's telling a story,

333
00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:17.190
there are very few people in the world is entertaining.
Is that guy,

334
00:19:17.191 --> 00:19:19.860
he has this realistic,

335
00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.590
sort of like a aggressive,

336
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:27.450
kind of like real brutal honesty,
you know,
but with a cool voice,

337
00:19:27.451 --> 00:19:31.200
you know,
he,
he can tell a fuck out of a story.
Well,
you know,

338
00:19:31.201 --> 00:19:36.180
brothers of famous people,
I'll take Tony Rock 20 rocks.
Hilarious.
He's good.

339
00:19:36.181 --> 00:19:39.300
He's very funny.
That guy gets slept on.
You know,
I,

340
00:19:39.301 --> 00:19:44.160
I had seen him a couple of years ago like way back at the laugh factory and he

341
00:19:44.161 --> 00:19:47.220
was really funny then he was like promising,
you know?
No,
he's really good.

342
00:19:47.221 --> 00:19:51.220
And then I saw him at the Improv like recently and I came up to him after his

343
00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:55.380
set.
I was like,
dude,
you got way better.
Like that was like really fun to watch.

344
00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:59.190
It's fun to watch a guy that you haven't seen for years and then you see them

345
00:19:59.191 --> 00:20:02.340
and you're like,
Tam,
you've been working.
And He,
and he's like,
thanks man.

346
00:20:02.341 --> 00:20:05.240
I'm going to be like him in the gym.
I'm in the gym.
You know,
he's,

347
00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:09.190
he's got the right attitude about it.
He's fucking good in the gym.
It isn't,

348
00:20:09.191 --> 00:20:14.100
it isn't the sounds.
What would it for us?
It's the gym.
You got to get on stage.

349
00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.420
I mean,
look at Bill Burr.
I mean,

350
00:20:15.421 --> 00:20:19.020
I've seen him take strides and he's so fucking perfect example.

351
00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.810
Bill Burr was always really funny.
But now it's like he's just a,

352
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:25.910
he's super prolific too.
Now he's just nailing it,
you know?
He's just like,

353
00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:29.730
he's constantly putting out new stuff and he'd go to see him.
It's,
you know,

354
00:20:29.731 --> 00:20:33.870
it's fun.
It's like,
you know,
I agree with them.
I don't agree with them.

355
00:20:33.871 --> 00:20:35.080
I'm still laughing.

356
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:38.900
He says something completely ridiculous and over aggressive of still living it.

357
00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:41.790
It's fucking great.
It's just,
it's,
he's a,

358
00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:46.500
he's one of the last of the Boston comics,
you know,

359
00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:48.350
that like,

360
00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:48.910
<v 5>uh,</v>

361
00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:53.590
intelligent but like still manly of progressive sort of comedians.

362
00:20:53.591 --> 00:20:57.500
There was a lot of guys like Boston,
Lenny Clarke and that whole group.

363
00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:00.700
That was one of the things that Dan Cook and I were talking about once about

364
00:21:00.701 --> 00:21:04.780
growing up and doing stand up together and Boston was that those guys were men.

365
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:08.050
They were fucking like Lenny call.
Yes,
we're tough guys.

366
00:21:08.051 --> 00:21:08.890
They were kind of Indians.

367
00:21:08.891 --> 00:21:12.870
They weren't like nebbishy problems with their mother kind of animals letting

368
00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:17.200
carc was a fucking savage.
Oh,
he was met Lenny right after you guys.

369
00:21:17.201 --> 00:21:21.590
Did he do you need to do the Hbo Comedy?
Rodney Dangerfield?
Yeah,

370
00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:26.290
I got a chance to open.
He was the second guy ever got paid to open four.

371
00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:30.130
Forget about the first guy and pretend it was,
he was the first for a while.

372
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:33.610
First time ever got paid.
I open up for Lindy Clark,
cause that sounds good,

373
00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.570
but it's really the second time,
first time was a guy named Warren Mcdonald's.

374
00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:40.180
Actually a very funny guy too.
But um,
but I,
uh,

375
00:21:40.181 --> 00:21:42.020
I worked with him right after he got done,

376
00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.170
just got done doing the Rodney special.
Oh my God.
He was in,

377
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:48.420
he's a fucking animal.
Such bowls.
Oh,
he was an animal.

378
00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:52.510
We were up in Seattle to see the NCAAS and that these guys,

379
00:21:52.511 --> 00:21:56.370
they were fucking drinking all day.
I can't,
I mean don and all them and uh,

380
00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:59.560
we're at a party and the CBS guy comes up to me and he says,

381
00:21:59.561 --> 00:22:01.480
I'm a big fan of yours.
And they didn't have a ticket.

382
00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:04.960
Lenny's at like Jackie Gleason bigger than he goes,
hey,

383
00:22:04.961 --> 00:22:07.630
if you are such a big fucking thing,
get him a ticket to the game.

384
00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:11.440
And the guy goes,
oh,
okay.
You know sheepishly like what's he going to do?

385
00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:17.610
What is that movie then I think is France Salameda did that movie on Oh yeah.

386
00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:21.730
Boston comedy.
Yeah.
How do you spell France?

387
00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:27.880
<v 9>I don't know.
Are Fr.</v>

388
00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:32.880
<v 5>See?
Yeah.
Oh,
when standups France,</v>

389
00:22:32.881 --> 00:22:34.550
Alameda,
when standup stood out,

390
00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:39.790
which is a great documentary on standup comedy and a all about the one town

391
00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:45.020
about Boston and what it was like,
you know,
back then and it's a,

392
00:22:45.021 --> 00:22:48.890
it's a really accurate depiction cause there's a lot of old video,

393
00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:51.890
like old video of Lenny Clarke and those guys and,

394
00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:53.930
and Jimmy tingle and then talking about the,

395
00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:59.510
the Ding Ho like the Chinese restaurant was like the first place,
man.
I'm,
I'm,

396
00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:02.990
I was like right after that way.
If those guys were like,

397
00:23:02.991 --> 00:23:07.090
these guys were the big established headliners right when I was becoming an old,

398
00:23:07.091 --> 00:23:10.360
they were good to me too.
Cause they could bury people if they want it to.
Nick's,

399
00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:15.080
Nick's was tough.
Well you know,
for the,
the people that don't know,

400
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:20.110
dom was one of the only guys that ever paid to see do comedy before or after.

401
00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:24.290
I was a comedian.
There was only like a few guys.
Once I became a comedian,

402
00:23:24.291 --> 00:23:27.810
like once I had done like open Mike Nights,
but,
uh,
I,

403
00:23:27.811 --> 00:23:30.710
I went to see you remember how much it costs to say me.
I wish I did.

404
00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:32.660
I went to see a day.
I want to see you a couple of times.

405
00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:37.410
I went to see you,
uh,
before I ever did standup.

406
00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:41.120
I'm pretty sure it was either before right before or right when I was doing it.

407
00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:46.280
But,
uh,
I went to cu and,
uh,
you didn't make the flight something and Dennis

408
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.890
<v 1>leary was in your place.
It was the first time I ever saw Dennis leary.</v>

409
00:23:48.891 --> 00:23:51.260
He fucking destroyed it.

410
00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:54.170
Then I remember it was good to back then he was on fire.

411
00:23:54.171 --> 00:23:57.520
He was my favorite comedian for six months until some,
you know,

412
00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.540
I thought I saw bill Hicks and I was like,
what the fuck is going on here?
See,

413
00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:04.100
I didn't,
I didn't see as much as other people did with the parallels.

414
00:24:04.101 --> 00:24:08.930
And [inaudible] was a friend of mine,
but yeah,
Bill had a funny joke about it.

415
00:24:08.931 --> 00:24:11.320
Oh,
he,
uh,
he actually had an event,

416
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:15.070
he went back in time and did the jokes before stolen,

417
00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:18.770
then went back in time and did them before an added punch lines.

418
00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:24.080
I don't know,
I think I butchered the quote,
but you know,

419
00:24:24.081 --> 00:24:26.750
when they asked him like,
you know,
who stole it from who

420
00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:30.720
<v 3>we know what my nightmare was about the HBO thing bed,
Rodney Dangerfield was,</v>

421
00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.870
it was like,
I'd rather not get a compliment in the comp when I would get,

422
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:35.670
I'd have somebody come up mega man,

423
00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:40.700
you're my favorite on a show beat you and that guy dice don't fucking compliment

424
00:24:41.191 --> 00:24:41.930
me up to be

425
00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:43.750
<v 7>because you,
I've always had</v>

426
00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:47.640
<v 1>problem with dice and now you and dice.
I've actually gotten into it.
But,
um,</v>

427
00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:50.790
when I was a kid,
man,
I was a fucking huge fan of dice.

428
00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:56.010
And if there's anything like his comedy,
it doesn't bother me.
I like it.
Oh,

429
00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:59.820
that's coming.
Doesn't bother me.
I just don't like him.
You don't like him?
Yeah.

430
00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:05.190
I never have a bad problem with him.
I've never had any issues with him.

431
00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:08.280
I can't be a 50,
60 year old.
Uh,
funds.

432
00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:11.700
See,
I look at him,
I think he's a character.

433
00:25:11.701 --> 00:25:14.910
You look at them and it's like he's some guy who disrespected you or something.

434
00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:20.070
Something happened.
Right.
There's only three comedians.
I,
Hey,
let me get one.

435
00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:21.023
Billy Crystal.

436
00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.430
<v 7>Oh,
considering the comedian,</v>

437
00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.153
what does that about?

438
00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:32.140
<v 3>There was a elite,
crystal was such an asshole to me.
I was really,
I was,
you know,</v>

439
00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.690
and he's always been really nice to me,

440
00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:37.770
but he was with Deniro and I was hosting this thing for comedy central and we're

441
00:25:37.771 --> 00:25:42.000
doing a review review of that shit movie,
analyze that.

442
00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:44.100
Remember the first one was good,
analyze this.

443
00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:48.140
<v 1>It was the neuro moves and in a second one wasn't good.
Yeah.</v>

444
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:51.030
<v 3>He got rolled the Sunday's buddying up with Deniro and he like,</v>

445
00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:54.690
he starts like act and condescending towards me,
so I fucked with him right away.

446
00:25:54.691 --> 00:25:58.640
I go,
Bill,
you hosting the Academy Awards here?
He goes,
I don't know why.
I said,

447
00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:02.430
can you mention me to the people,
the academy?
He goes,
for what?
I go,
I don't know,

448
00:26:02.431 --> 00:26:03.960
some kind of award.
You figure it out.

449
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:07.400
<v 7>Then he realized,
he realized I had duped them.</v>

450
00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:14.990
You figure it out.
Yeah,
we,

451
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:16.610
he lost his sense of humor.
Right.

452
00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:21.620
<v 3>Too Cool.
But I mean,
you know,
he was always a right to be in that situation.</v>

453
00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:22.550
He lost his sense.
Oh yeah.

454
00:26:22.551 --> 00:26:25.880
Well he was trying to act like him and didn't know where these dear friends and

455
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:28.580
thinking,
this is Robert Deniro sitting next to you.

456
00:26:28.581 --> 00:26:30.470
Come on Billy and Billy Crystal Eagle.

457
00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:34.130
<v 7>People love to be friends with someone like to narrow.</v>

458
00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.510
You could put that shit on your resume.

459
00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:38.840
And I'm going over Bobby [inaudible] house for Barbecue this weekend.

460
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:44.040
I did a reading with him.
Rarely do I get impressed.

461
00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:49.860
<v 2>You imagine someone saying that to you and wearing like a running track suit and</v>

462
00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:54.000
lawyer.
Fuck that noise was like fake Italian immigrants.

463
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:58.760
Immigrants to California from the east coast.
Fake Italian dudes.

464
00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:00.210
We're always connected.

465
00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:04.680
You know those guys were always trying to break into acting since this fake

466
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:08.340
tough guy dudes.
Right,
right.
Oh,
go to Bobby D's house.

467
00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:10.230
Oh God.

468
00:27:10.231 --> 00:27:14.880
That Bobby T.
K.
U.
Who else?

469
00:27:14.881 --> 00:27:16.800
Who else is it real Sean Connery.

470
00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:18.990
And if you could say you're friends with Sean Connery.

471
00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:21.480
I'm going fly fishing with Sean Connery actually.

472
00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:25.230
Well that's people who have to drop.
Even like countries.
Yeah.

473
00:27:25.231 --> 00:27:27.540
I got these other nice shoes you've got to in France.

474
00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:31.100
You're like that makes it a fucking big deal.
That's all he got them in France.

475
00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.350
Would you,
would you be friends with uh,
what's his face?

476
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:38.550
The guy from Paul fixing shit.
That's a,
I'm a guy.
Just had a brain fart.

477
00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:42.450
John Travolta.
John Travolta.
Cause I think you fuck you.
I think if your friends,

478
00:27:42.451 --> 00:27:45.060
that's what happens.
He fucks you.
Somebody's friend.

479
00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:48.040
I heard it on some radio station with a pal.
What's he to cut?

480
00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:50.460
It was in Greece that recently died from a drug overdose.

481
00:27:50.461 --> 00:27:53.310
So that was at Contiki or not?
Cause it can negate that.

482
00:27:53.311 --> 00:27:58.050
Recently died of a drug over the other main guy in Greece that that was in

483
00:27:58.051 --> 00:28:02.070
celebrity rehab.
Was he the guy that was in a taxi?
Yeah.

484
00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:03.893
Is that the guy?

485
00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:09.000
Cause I think you're talking about Jeff something or another just recently died.

486
00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:11.580
I don't know.
I don't know that guy's name.
I don't know.
I'll look it up.

487
00:28:11.581 --> 00:28:12.930
And I had heard that,
that,
see,

488
00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:17.820
I've only really watched celebrity rehab once and uh,
I get depressed.

489
00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:20.910
I don't,
I don't like watching people that are fallen apart.

490
00:28:20.911 --> 00:28:24.050
I don't like taking in that Vibe,
you know?
I know.

491
00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:28.530
I mean occasionally I like to know it's Jeff Conway.
Jeff Conway is not the guy.

492
00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:29.550
Yeah,
he,
he said that,

493
00:28:29.551 --> 00:28:33.030
that he actually spent a night once at his house and supposedly this is what I

494
00:28:33.031 --> 00:28:36.450
heard and radius ratio that he went over there to spend the night at his house

495
00:28:36.451 --> 00:28:40.710
and he crashed and he woke up and,
and he was fondling him like,
like

496
00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.300
Travolta was fondling them.
Oh.
Might hate that.

497
00:28:45.301 --> 00:28:47.470
Don't you hate when you wake up and we in front of his playing with your balls,

498
00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:52.980
you wake up in the dude from pulp fiction is sucker going and then,

499
00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:57.390
and then Michael,
you suck my Dick.
Will you leave me alone?
Mike Wallace,

500
00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:59.400
I heard that Mike Wallace from Nash,

501
00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:03.990
whatever the inquirer is or whatever he works for that released all this shit.

502
00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:08.250
Said they asked him,
you know,
like,
is this shit fake?
Or You guys just trying,

503
00:29:08.251 --> 00:29:11.970
you know,
are these people really telling the truth?
And they're like,

504
00:29:11.971 --> 00:29:15.290
do we give him lie detector tests?
We fucking like go and check.

505
00:29:15.291 --> 00:29:18.600
Like if they say any detail like going to like hotels or something like that.

506
00:29:18.601 --> 00:29:21.430
They,
they get it.
This was on the Howard stern show that,

507
00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.130
that he said this and stuff like that,

508
00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:26.550
that all these people are all telling the truth like all of them.

509
00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:31.470
So all these messsage are telling the truth.
He has that crazy.
Well,
who knows?

510
00:29:31.471 --> 00:29:32.161
We don't know.

511
00:29:32.161 --> 00:29:35.670
We don't have an official stance on this Joe Rogan experience podcast.

512
00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.280
Brian Ryan.
I'm just regurgitating what,

513
00:29:38.281 --> 00:29:41.590
what I've been hearing on happened to know,
but I'm not talking

514
00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:44.890
<v 5>dogs off this.
You know what I'll be talking.</v>

515
00:29:44.891 --> 00:29:47.040

518
00:29:54.491 --> 00:29:58.010
That's what I'll be calling those big manly hands that you have.
I bet you would.

519
00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:00.730
You would give a good massage.
I hedge.
You're very soft.

520
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:05.320
They could take it toughen up quickly.
You wouldn't be a good,
good show.

521
00:30:05.321 --> 00:30:08.950
Is Dom and Joey Diaz dressed up as women like bosom buddies?

522
00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.030
<v 4>I never thought I'd say this,
but I'd be the hot one</v>

523
00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:26.290
<v 5>with a golden girls.
Maybe thrown another person.
Oh,</v>

524
00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:29.880
I like seeing people like Joe Cause it makes me feel not as fast.

525
00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:33.300
<v 4>Not Dead set.</v>

526
00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:34.490
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

527
00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:39.340
I do a joke about like how chaotic my life is when I'm hanging around with Joey

528
00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:44.320
Diaz.
I'm like,
I'm fine.
I just like a balanced calendar.
A leveler.

529
00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:46.540
He's your canary in the coal mine.
Canary in the coal mine.

530
00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:51.460
I love Joey and I know what he's thinking.
Oh man,
that look on his face.

531
00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:55.060
Joey Diaz.
Could we just read the newspaper and have you crying?
Laughing.
Yeah,

532
00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:57.940
just point out anything.
I never met a dude who's,

533
00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:01.170
who makes me laugh like that guy does on a consistent basis.

534
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:04.180
He gets fucking crazy.
You'll get crazy about ketchup,

535
00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:08.620
but he's the same fucking catch up.
Joe Rogan back in Jersey.

536
00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:11.820
We got to fucking catch up.
It was real ketchup.

537
00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:14.480
This is some watery bullshit.

538
00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.830
It doesn't taste like get the fucking angry.
No,

539
00:31:17.831 --> 00:31:19.090
Heinz is actually pretty good enough.

540
00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:24.330
Fuck Joey just got off the road with him.

541
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:29.020
Right and and one of the hotels we stayed at,
I had a business there was like,

542
00:31:29.021 --> 00:31:29.351
come on,

543
00:31:29.351 --> 00:31:32.560
you got to go to the business center with me and just watching him sit here

544
00:31:32.561 --> 00:31:35.030
checking his thing,
my jiggers,
they click on that picture,

545
00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:38.320
like he's just sitting there like with his glasses on doing the computer system.

546
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:40.520
I worked in

547
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:46.510
and prompt and the whole day hung up the club so it could use the phone really

548
00:31:46.511 --> 00:31:50.260
to make local calls.
He can fucking steal from the room,

549
00:31:50.261 --> 00:31:54.190
but she chose to do it from the club.
He used to.
He used to,

550
00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:57.100
he's Cubano phone for the longest time.

551
00:31:57.101 --> 00:31:59.920
Joey just had a pager when everybody else had itself.
Hey Joe,

552
00:31:59.921 --> 00:32:02.350
he still had a pager.
Yeah,
he would just,

553
00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:06.870
you would never be able to find them too.
Now he's embraced it,
man.

554
00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:10.200
He has number one fucking CD on iTunes comedy praise.

555
00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:12.550
He's gone completely digital.
Yeah.

556
00:32:12.551 --> 00:32:16.150
We got Joey on Twitter and then Joey started really getting into it for awhile.

557
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:19.050
Like,
fuck this my space,
Facebook.
Fuck am I doing?

558
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:23.350
And then after a while I'm not sending you'll fucking text message to Joe Rogan.

559
00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:23.871
You know?

560
00:32:23.871 --> 00:32:27.130
Remember you had a whole video about you sending him text messages that he would

561
00:32:27.131 --> 00:32:30.790
get angry.
He,
we'd made a video about,
it was one of the,

562
00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:34.210
one of the earliest videos that they were called a,
that was a desk squad one,

563
00:32:34.211 --> 00:32:39.040
right?
What number was it?
No,
that was Joe show.
Joey is ready to die.
Oh,

564
00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:42.900
Diaz.
When he did die.
God Damn it.
If you can find that.
Is that online somewhere?

565
00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:46.910
What's his home?
It's way.
It's fucking,
it's a brilliant,
brilliant video.

566
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:51.650
It's z as he was alive.
He's a science project.

567
00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:58.650
We have Joey Diaz just sits you down and goes over all the substances dog all

568
00:32:59.061 --> 00:33:03.710
the years,
all the pink Floyd albums.
I listened to mother Fucker,

569
00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:06.320
if he,
if he wouldn't go over his history,
you'd be like,

570
00:33:06.321 --> 00:33:08.930
there's no way he could be alive.
How's this guy?
How's it possible?

571
00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:14.180
He's healthy as a horse.
Joey Diaz is a fucking savage.
I live to be a thousand.

572
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:16.400
It's amazing.
Isn't everything.

573
00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:20.540
High School football players die on a field from dehydration and then you get

574
00:33:20.541 --> 00:33:23.390
guys who wake up every day thinking how can I kill myself today?

575
00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:26.730
And they're still,
well Joey's really helping now.
He lost a lot of good,

576
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:30.170
he lost like 80 pounds.
He lost a lot of way.

577
00:33:30.171 --> 00:33:33.800
He cause he got real big for a while and it's suck cause like we would go places

578
00:33:33.801 --> 00:33:38.690
like we would go to the airport and he hated when he had a like a long walk to

579
00:33:38.691 --> 00:33:42.080
the rental car.
That's a bad sign.
It's like,
you know he would get,

580
00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:45.800
he was getting big but he had you know and he didn't want to do it with surgery.

581
00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.060
He just did it with his will.

582
00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:50.030
He just got on weight watchers and slowly shut it away.

583
00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:53.100
He could definitely raise much.
Was on the road though.
How did it help?

584
00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.390
How do you cook the Shit and all?

585
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:57.200
I think it's like they give you like a point system.

586
00:33:57.201 --> 00:33:58.820
I think the way it works is like,
you know,

587
00:33:58.821 --> 00:34:02.350
pizza is x amount of points and this is that amount of points.

588
00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:06.070
You get so many points a day and they have a broken.

589
00:34:06.071 --> 00:34:09.560
Now we're really healthy things or like very few points.

590
00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:13.280
Like I think like salary is like 0.2 get just eat salary by itself.

591
00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.700
It's mostly water.
Yeah.
You can't even get it.

592
00:34:15.701 --> 00:34:18.710
It actually is really good for your cleans,
your cleans,
your poop shoot out.

593
00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:22.010
Well that's good to know.
Tremendous.
Tremendously Travolta.
I uh,

594
00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.340
I drank this Kale shake that has a lot of salary and it was five stalks of

595
00:34:25.341 --> 00:34:29.810
celery in it.
So I take every day five stocks or salary,
five stalks of Celery,

596
00:34:29.811 --> 00:34:34.811
a big Bush or a big fucking leaf of Kale pairs,

597
00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:40.240
garlic ginger,
and it grinds it all apart and makes it like a swollen,

598
00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.410
like a,
like a soupy like pea soup.

599
00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:45.230
Very much like pea soup and where you went in a cover of a magazine.

600
00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:50.930
I was having a cup of liquid Lawrence.
Man,
I haven't seen that.

601
00:34:50.931 --> 00:34:55.610
I want to say I just like split in half.
You're like doing a split.
Um,

602
00:34:55.611 --> 00:35:00.140
one of 'em.
Yeah,
I think,
I think I was throwing like,
no,

603
00:35:00.141 --> 00:35:03.900
you know why in the black belt one now it's just standing there like I looked

604
00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:07.430
really stupid.
I should've never let them make me pose like that.

605
00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.640
It's like once you like cross your arms,
look at the camera like very serious.

606
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:14.900
And so that's what I did and I was like,
who
was opposed to,

607
00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:16.970
what message is that?
I should be smiling.

608
00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:20.590
Do you think you could beat the two of us if we just charge you right.

609
00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.640
I would hope.
I would never have to know.

610
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.660
How do she do I look and look at your old tattoo right there when my port
tattoo,

611
00:35:26.661 --> 00:35:27.290
it's still there.

612
00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:30.650
I got to get it lasered off to finish my right to leave the Aaron Dellavedova

613
00:35:30.651 --> 00:35:34.070
sleeve.
That's Graphics Bong,
right?
No,
no,
no.
It's um,

614
00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:38.480
it was a like a thing that I drew.
It was like a demon adjusters mascot.

615
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:41.910
<v 1>It's so crazy because I always thought it was the graphics.
Damn.</v>

616
00:35:41.911 --> 00:35:46.830
That dude loves fucking we,
it's so stupid.
It's such a stupid little touch here.

617
00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:49.320
Well,
I was an artist.
I actually drew that,
you know,

618
00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:54.350
and when I was a kid I used to draw a lot of demons with like hats and deemed

619
00:35:54.501 --> 00:35:58.770
like demons with baseball,
hats on and shit like standing over little kids' beds.

620
00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:02.410
I used to draw some creepy shit and uh,

621
00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:04.890
I drew that and so that was my first tattoo.

622
00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:07.710
I just noticed it says Joe Rogan proves fear is not,

623
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:15.890
I guess I was in my early thirties.
Yeah.

624
00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:20.130
Cause fear factor went on for like six years.

625
00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:24.030
We were still in your 20s when I met you.
Yes.
Yeah.
When,
when we met,

626
00:36:24.031 --> 00:36:28.680
I was really young.
You and I met when we did Montreal together.

627
00:36:28.681 --> 00:36:33.090
We did a showtime,
I think I was only like 24 25 and then we,

628
00:36:33.091 --> 00:36:36.900
we met in New York at the end.
David Brenner's pool.
Yeah,
we played pool together.

629
00:36:36.901 --> 00:36:40.740
We met at a Amsterdam and Dom's one of the few weeks I brought my queue today,

630
00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:44.790
dom was one of those guys.
We,
we threatened to play each other like once a month.

631
00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.000
That's what we always say.
We tried to get,
but sometimes we'll go like years.

632
00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:51.810
Did you just show me?
Oh,
that's the one I was talking to him about.
No,

633
00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:55.980
if I was a gay man,
Oh shit I do at the end.
To me

634
00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:03.540
I just did a new thing for this fighters only magazine.

635
00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:07.410
Just at a more recent one or I don't look as good.

636
00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:10.620
That's the last fight you've been in like a real fight,
like a fist fight,

637
00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:15.420
like a street fight.
Not since I was a teenager.
Yeah.
I avoid everything.

638
00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:20.570
She got to kill people the way you will or you get sick or shot or it.

639
00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:22.260
Guess what?
It's a lot of people out there that know how to fight.

640
00:37:22.261 --> 00:37:23.460
They might beat your fucking ass.

641
00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:27.050
You know the idea of going around and getting in fights with people,

642
00:37:27.051 --> 00:37:32.051
it's like most almost everything we could get along without that.

643
00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:37.800
Almost every situation life could get along without someone beating the fuck out

644
00:37:37.801 --> 00:37:41.910
of somebody.
Almost everyone I was saying and when it's not,

645
00:37:41.911 --> 00:37:44.160
when you can't get along without it,
it's like,
well,

646
00:37:44.161 --> 00:37:46.140
you're in the presence of some sort of a dangerous,

647
00:37:46.141 --> 00:37:50.710
scary person who's not thinking clearly otherwise.
I think Brian and I go,

648
00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:53.110
what do you think would win their fight?
Brian Wade.

649
00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:58.170
He would just quit right away.
Get out of breath.
Are you ticklish?

650
00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:02.930
I Dunno.
Like if I go over there and you just give,
never get tickled by a guy.

651
00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:04.380
What if I just give you a little tickler,
right?
Yeah.

652
00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:09.440
He just ripped his pants and he opens up his butt and the vision is so horrific

653
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:15.480
and it's your shirt falls down into his armpit so it's got hangs down and he's

654
00:38:15.481 --> 00:38:18.240
just opening up as assholes.
Why is convenient?
You just run away.

655
00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:20.270
You'll just run out what you want,
want none of that good.

656
00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:24.210
What he's willing to do to you,
and then he come close to him.

657
00:38:24.211 --> 00:38:27.150
We'll try to lick you or something.
It's like,
you don't know want that.

658
00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:30.390
They don't want that.
He'll just grab your face and just start licking you.

659
00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:34.020
I'm glad I had tongue kiss you tongue kiss you to get out of trouble.

660
00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:36.670
He would tongue kiss you,
just grab you and just start making out with you.

661
00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:39.280
When you would run,
you would run.

662
00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:43.840
You know every animal has it's own way of defending itself in its environment.

663
00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:48.010
Like act of Octopus's.
They blend in.
They become,

664
00:38:48.011 --> 00:38:50.110
they can become camouflaged,
right?
Yes.

665
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:53.680
There's a lot of a lot of animals they blend in with the reef right down.

666
00:38:53.681 --> 00:38:56.530
My rarer.
Yes.
That's why Nimo was so brightly colored.

667
00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:59.190
Is that why it's amino could blend in with the reed.

668
00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:01.150
I was hoping we get the name of the show.

669
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.600
I assume that's a beautiful fish.
Why?
Why?

670
00:39:05.601 --> 00:39:08.680
Why would nature wants something so brightly colored?
Cause it's cute.

671
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:10.390
It's pretty fucking bizarre man.

672
00:39:10.391 --> 00:39:14.080
When you think about the colors that nature is chosen and stuck with as far as

673
00:39:14.081 --> 00:39:19.081
designs of things like tiger's like a big giant crazy killing machine that's

674
00:39:19.661 --> 00:39:23.470
beautiful with like white and like different cost stripes to it.

675
00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:26.050
It's not just like why does it have to have different stripes too?

676
00:39:26.051 --> 00:39:29.050
It's obviously just fucking things up.
That's all this thing does.

677
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:32.950
Like it's not worried about anybody.
Like that thing has no natural predator,

678
00:39:32.951 --> 00:39:34.480
so it's completely fearless.

679
00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:39.340
So it was expressing itself as boldly as it wants to.
It's not hiding from shit.

680
00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:44.080
It's on the the apex of the predators,
you know?
But why is it so beautiful?

681
00:39:44.081 --> 00:39:45.760
Why is it colored like that?
Like what?

682
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.860
What benefit of natural selection was it that the Tigers that made it to

683
00:39:50.861 --> 00:39:55.210
maturity and live the longest and decided to outbreed the others were the ones

684
00:39:55.211 --> 00:39:58.480
that were brightly colored and beautiful.
That's wild man.

685
00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:00.340
You know how we find new species all the time?

686
00:40:00.341 --> 00:40:02.410
Wouldn't be cool if he found like new colors once in a while.

687
00:40:02.411 --> 00:40:05.910
Like I just found this new color your mind?
Yeah.

688
00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:10.090
Like if they just figure out like something that they can add like hard disk

689
00:40:10.091 --> 00:40:14.230
space to your optical nerves and all of a sudden you see a broader spectrum of

690
00:40:14.231 --> 00:40:15.910
colors or just a different color.
Like,

691
00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:18.820
like imagine because we grew up with all these colors,

692
00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:21.850
but if you just throw in a color into the mix and it will pull all the charts

693
00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:25.000
and it's amazing that you guys grew up.
Doesn't seem to effect.

694
00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:27.710
<v 4>Yeah,
I,</v>

695
00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:32.460
<v 1>I mean is it possible that there could be another color?</v>

696
00:40:32.461 --> 00:40:34.110
I don't know anything about color.
I don't know.

697
00:40:34.111 --> 00:40:35.400
Because we have this whole graphic,

698
00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:39.360
the color wheel and rainbows and shit to like go on as proof and like that's the

699
00:40:39.361 --> 00:40:42.180
only thing that seller to spectrum.
But what if we,

700
00:40:42.181 --> 00:40:45.300
there's something just throws a wrench into that mix and an hour you're like,
oh,

701
00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:49.920
that.
Yeah.
I mean that has to have happened throughout history,
right?

702
00:40:49.921 --> 00:40:52.590
Where they thought they figured out.
Right.

703
00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:55.950
Well how about those assholes that we're using leeches.
Oh,

704
00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:57.820
how the fuck did that over half the blood with,

705
00:40:57.821 --> 00:41:02.330
he said doctors that were using leeches gone to doctor school.

706
00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:04.490
Like,
I'm here to help.
Like,
well,

707
00:41:04.491 --> 00:41:08.790
how about blood letting Joe go fucking do for a sick person.

708
00:41:08.791 --> 00:41:10.780
It's like we're blood at the bottom.
Me.

709
00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:13.050
And they thought there was bad blood inside of them.

710
00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:18.330
There was so much stupidity when it came to the human anatomy and,

711
00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:19.470
and how to fix things.

712
00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:24.420
They used to use leeches on black eyes for they did when the swollen eye,

713
00:41:24.421 --> 00:41:27.280
they put a,
she would suck the blood out.
You remember?
And Rocky,
the,

714
00:41:27.281 --> 00:41:31.350
he couldn't see out of his eye mic actually asked him to cut him.

715
00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:34.040
Come me Mick,
what kind

716
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.400
<v 5>of nonsense done that door in sets,
but isn't that ridiculous?</v>

717
00:41:37.401 --> 00:41:42.200
Like no one ever done that.
Why did they put that in a movie?
Goddammit.

718
00:41:42.201 --> 00:41:47.030
Sly.
I want some answers.
C'Mon Burgess burden is that guy is fucking,

719
00:41:47.031 --> 00:41:48.770
we bigger than everybody says he is.

720
00:41:48.771 --> 00:41:52.130
I am so tired of everybody telling me that Sylvester Stallone is like this

721
00:41:52.131 --> 00:41:55.850
little tiny guy.
Like people have this some weird thing to take.

722
00:41:55.851 --> 00:41:59.850
Guys like him and Tom Cruise go.
Yeah,
well he's only five foot wall.
Yeah,
right.

723
00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:00.741
Yeah.

724
00:42:00.741 --> 00:42:04.970
Well maybe he's got fucking billions and maybe it looks good at 70 but he's only

725
00:42:04.971 --> 00:42:07.400
fucking five foot three.
But he does wear heels.

726
00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:09.740
I'm five foot eight and he's bigger than me.
He wears heels.

727
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:12.740
He's whatever he's wearing.
He's a big guy.
I said,

728
00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:16.820
let him a few times his physical with like,
he's a,
that's a thick dude,
man.

729
00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:19.100
I tell you what he said to me,
which is fucking hilarious.
What'd he say?

730
00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:23.820
That I met him at this thing to name drop was Bruce Willis was the opening in

731
00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:27.080
Montreal for a planet Hollywood.
And very nicely though,

732
00:42:27.081 --> 00:42:31.340
he comes up to me and I'm with Sophie and he goes,
Hey,
dumb,
I'm slow.

733
00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:36.020
I don't know.
I met you in a Paul Rogers thing.
And I go,
yes,
I remember you.

734
00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:37.700
I'm thinking in the back of my head.

735
00:42:37.701 --> 00:42:41.660
I'm thinking then [inaudible] fucking rocky.

736
00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:46.040
Do I remember you fucking kidding me?
I got a chance.

737
00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:49.330
<v 6>Interview him for a one of the UFC.
He was a,
it was,</v>

738
00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:53.520
I think it was before the expendables are one of it,
one of his movies.
And uh,

739
00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:56.110
I got a chance to interview and I was like,
this is crazy man.

740
00:42:56.111 --> 00:42:58.990
Because when I was a kid,
I mean every,
how many people have told them this story?

741
00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:03.450
Uh,
I saw his movie and then I went out and ate raw eggs and ran around

742
00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:08.710
<v 5>trying to catch a chicken.
I eat raw eggs just like he did it.</v>

743
00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:12.220
I put on a sweatsuit and I ran around the block like a fucking idiot.

744
00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:13.540
I was so inspired.

745
00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:17.470
I hadn't done any martial arts training at all at this point.
What?

746
00:43:17.471 --> 00:43:22.090
It was a little perfect movie for that kind of inspiration,
those,
Oh,
you know,
it,

747
00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:25.660
it was so interesting how touching that's simple movie could be.

748
00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:27.390
<v 6>Yeah,
there was some,</v>

749
00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:32.870
we love watching someone try to pull something off.
People love underdogs.

750
00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:37.760
You know,
I don't know if you know this,
but um,
the UFC light heavyweight champ,

751
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:41.690
Jon Jones just got into a car accident.
I don't know about this.
No,

752
00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:44.990
he's okay.
He was drunk though.
And uh,

753
00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:48.710
apparently allegedly the story is that he's the least.

754
00:43:48.830 --> 00:43:51.920
I don't at least they arrested him for Dui.
Okay.

755
00:43:51.921 --> 00:43:53.420
I don't know whether or not he was drunk.
I don't know.

756
00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:56.060
I don't know the full particulars of the story,

757
00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:01.040
but so many people are like shitting on this kid,

758
00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:01.841
you know,
and,

759
00:44:01.841 --> 00:44:05.330
and angry with them as they should be for anybody who's driving truck and

760
00:44:05.331 --> 00:44:08.420
anybody who loses control of their car and crashes into a tree.

761
00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:14.860
But I think there's a little extra venom about this guy because he's so

762
00:44:15.921 --> 00:44:19.670
successful because he,
he's like,

763
00:44:19.671 --> 00:44:23.300
it's come so easy to him and it's not easy.
Obviously it's hard work,

764
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:28.510
but he's been like dominating all these people and I think we like to shoot

765
00:44:28.881 --> 00:44:30.440
people down when they get too big.

766
00:44:30.441 --> 00:44:34.320
We like to look for the first flaw and this make no mistake about it.

767
00:44:34.321 --> 00:44:36.930
There's no like apology for what he's done because what he's done scares the

768
00:44:36.931 --> 00:44:41.000
fuck out of me.
The one thing that I'm terrified of is finding,
you know,

769
00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:44.130
myself on the road and seeing someone who's drunk coming towards you who doesn't

770
00:44:44.131 --> 00:44:46.200
have control of the car.
That's it.
It's a terrible feeling.

771
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:49.200
And we've seen drunks on the highway before.
It's,
it's,
it's a scary,

772
00:44:49.201 --> 00:44:50.130
scary fucking thing.

773
00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:53.880
So this guy loses control of his car and slammed into a pole.

774
00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:58.920
And whenever the fuck cause him to do that,
that's bad.
That's fucking real bad.

775
00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:04.910
But I think people were also like chipping away at this dude as a human because

776
00:45:05.221 --> 00:45:09.810
he's been so successful so quick and because he sort of tries to promote himself

777
00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:13.750
as like a,
you know,
a,
a god fearing man and you know,

778
00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:18.630
he tries to promote himself as,
um,
as like a,
a good Christian.

779
00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:20.940
And because of that,
you know,

780
00:45:20.941 --> 00:45:23.160
when he makes a mistake and does something fucked up,

781
00:45:23.161 --> 00:45:26.580
people like really go after him because you can't,

782
00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:31.560
it's very difficult when you set like a big example,
you know,
and you want it,

783
00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:33.780
you want to set an,

784
00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:38.310
an amazing path for kids and then you do something like,
you know,

785
00:45:38.311 --> 00:45:39.920
you say that's what you're doing and you,

786
00:45:39.921 --> 00:45:43.950
you say you're going to be a hero for these kids and,
and then boom,

787
00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:45.670
you have this horrible situation.

788
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:48.850
<v 5>Everybody's waiting for Tim Tebow to fail.
Well,
yeah,</v>

789
00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:52.410
they're waiting for him to get pictures of him fucking a goat or something.

790
00:45:52.810 --> 00:45:53.790
And I mean they would love that.

791
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:58.760
<v 6>Look,
I think it's the whole thing is a,
it's a fucking tragedy on the human,</v>

792
00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:01.940
the human personality,
the human,

793
00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:07.120
the individual that allows themselves to get to a situation where they smash a

794
00:46:08.091 --> 00:46:12.200
car into a tree cause they're fucked up on,
on a drug.
It's,
it's scary

795
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:16.680
<v 5>cause you're,
you're taking all of our lives at risk to with your,
you know,</v>

796
00:46:16.681 --> 00:46:21.600
your craziness.
No,
I just,
um,
well don't,
I just don't drive since the Ui,

797
00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:25.950
how to Dui,
I don't fucking drive the thing.
The appeal of rocky

798
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:31.550
<v 6>is the same appeal that we all want to see somebody rise up and stop the</v>

799
00:46:33.721 --> 00:46:34.490
unstoppable

800
00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:38.480
<v 5>made up a black guy.
And when someone's really good,
we want them to fail.</v>

801
00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:41.780
We secretly wanted Tyson to fail before he failed.

802
00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:43.280
And then when he failed people,

803
00:46:43.281 --> 00:46:46.670
like there was like a weight lifted off the world of like on the million men,

804
00:46:46.671 --> 00:46:49.220
they like to see the bully knocked down.
Yeah.
And then never,

805
00:46:49.221 --> 00:46:51.050
the show is never the same after that.

806
00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:55.130
He never fought the same and they read the same confidence.
Well,
I think he had,

807
00:46:55.250 --> 00:46:58.670
I think you can only maintain that sort of pace that he was doing.

808
00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:00.950
You could only,
depending upon your personality,

809
00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:03.070
but it can only go for a few years.
They,

810
00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:07.940
the amount of ray was and it was menacing was it?
Oh,
he was the best ever.

811
00:47:08.850 --> 00:47:11.960
You know,
everybody wants to say,
but Ali Ali was a great fighter.

812
00:47:11.961 --> 00:47:14.780
No doubt about it.
Tyson was better.
I really think Tyson was better.

813
00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:18.470
I think Tyson in his prime,
like the Marvis Frazier prime,
I don't think,

814
00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:20.690
I don't think Ali would have been able to keep him off.
I was,

815
00:47:20.691 --> 00:47:25.040
I was ringside on when he fought Leon Michael Spinks.
Oh,

816
00:47:25.041 --> 00:47:28.400
Atlantic city.
It was a scare.
It was like up jumped the devil.
Oh,
I was like,

817
00:47:28.401 --> 00:47:32.530
smoke was out of his nostrils.
Took shit to a whole new level.

818
00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:35.520
It was unbelievable.
There was a bunch of guys when I,
this was like,
you know,

819
00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:39.940
I was a big boxing fan in high school and this was around that time that Tyson

820
00:47:39.941 --> 00:47:42.240
sort of rose to prominence.
Like right when I was getting out of high school.

821
00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:43.990
It was like the cover of sports illustrated.

822
00:47:43.991 --> 00:47:47.260
They called them wonder kid and he was 19 years 18 yeah,
yeah.

823
00:47:47.261 --> 00:47:52.261
And he was fucking smash and people get mad you and he was like Robin Person.

824
00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:56.860
Oh,
scary.
That would have been,
he was such a,
an amazing specimen.

825
00:47:56.861 --> 00:47:58.800
But he's also intelligent and just the,

826
00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:02.470
but the physical speed that guy had while maintaining,
you know,

827
00:48:02.471 --> 00:48:06.820
two 2100 and whatever pounds he was,
it was incredible.
Now we'd do it.

828
00:48:06.821 --> 00:48:08.800
We'd never had anybody that could punch that fast.

829
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:13.510
The Marvis Frazier fight is one of the worst Smallings in a professional

830
00:48:13.511 --> 00:48:16.000
heavyweight fight ever of all time.
Well,

831
00:48:16.001 --> 00:48:19.420
I'll tell you what was Beth and Randall Cobb when he got beat by Larry Holmes,

832
00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:21.450
dad was in his band one that him to go down.

833
00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:25.030
We're all friends and go down Randall.
Good.
Now I know he couldn't,

834
00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:27.940
but it was horrible.
That was a,
that was her ferocious beating.

835
00:48:27.941 --> 00:48:30.640
But you know what he did after that and he went to school and got a master's

836
00:48:30.641 --> 00:48:33.790
degree.
That guy like he's got out of boxing,

837
00:48:33.850 --> 00:48:38.500
did acting and I dunno if he suffers anything from his,
uh,
his mean his,

838
00:48:38.590 --> 00:48:42.200
you know,
you talked to him,
then he repeats himself and it's no way around that.

839
00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:45.310
And then you'll talk to him and a repeated himself.
There's no way around that.

840
00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:47.980
That's scary shit.
You know,
uh,
getting,

841
00:48:47.981 --> 00:48:51.640
getting struck in the head on a repeated basis.
And there's a lot of guys that,

842
00:48:51.641 --> 00:48:55.180
um,
that,
that suffer with a called pugilistic dementia.

843
00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:57.550
A lot of guys suffer it that never even go proud.

844
00:48:57.551 --> 00:49:01.900
Just guys who have good Jim fine.
We know May,
may Ali,
you know her.
Yeah.
Yeah.

845
00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:05.830
And she would tell him,
cause my father knows everything that's going on,

846
00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:08.980
he just gets bodies just failing them.
But his mind is right there.

847
00:49:08.981 --> 00:49:12.640
He's like trapped in his body.
Could you imagine,
ma'am?
Well,
you know,

848
00:49:12.641 --> 00:49:15.050
that's what cracks me up about the football thing with like gold,

849
00:49:15.051 --> 00:49:19.030
the research you're doing on concussions.
Of course,
their concussion of course.

850
00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:23.070
Of course.
Every 40 seconds they were like in a car accident.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,

851
00:49:23.071 --> 00:49:26.230
I don't know if it's that much,
but it's,
it's pretty horrendous.
Yeah.

852
00:49:26.231 --> 00:49:28.370
If you look at some of those leads,
that's football.

853
00:49:28.371 --> 00:49:31.270
They used to call him dingers.
What's the biggest linebacker they have now?

854
00:49:31.271 --> 00:49:34.840
Who's the biggest?
I Dunno.
I Dunno who the biggest give me like a give me a big,

855
00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:35.790
big fucking scared.

856
00:49:35.790 --> 00:49:40.790
Like six five for a linebacker to 70 to 70 that'd be pretty big.

857
00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:45.780
No,
but fast.
That's the thing.
You have to remember.
They're fucking fast.
Oh,

858
00:49:45.850 --> 00:49:49.250
and they're hitting you with a lot of super athletes.
Yeah.

859
00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:52.210
Oh yeah.
There sure.

860
00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:55.190
You know Herschel Walker is still beating the fuck out of here out of people I

861
00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:58.780
know that.
Well,
48 years old.
He was a phenomena.
Yeah.

862
00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:04.610
What a freak combination of like a guy who's completely driven is a natural

863
00:50:06.491 --> 00:50:10.290
super acid.
Multiple correctable discipline.
He had multiple personality too.
Yeah.

864
00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:13.770
He came in with different personalities and the therapy you heard about.
Yeah,

865
00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:16.380
I did hear about that fucking crazy tandem.

866
00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:20.690
Supposedly trauma induced like,
Oh,
I dunno.
I,
I thought that the,

867
00:50:20.691 --> 00:50:24.060
that was one of the issues that this was something that is related to his

868
00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:26.950
football career.
That,
I dunno,
but I just,

869
00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:31.510
that he imagined him coming in as big sue.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.
Hi Big Sue.

870
00:50:31.511 --> 00:50:35.180
How are you feeling today?
I'm gonna look this up,
but multiple personality.
Yeah.

871
00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:39.080
It's what I think it is.
All of a sudden I'm a,
I'm a therapist,
but it's not,

872
00:50:39.081 --> 00:50:43.830
it's not a psychosis.
It's a,
it's an erotic disorder person.
Erotic,

873
00:50:43.930 --> 00:50:48.300
not neurotic.
Oh,
hey dom,
I find that Rodeo,

874
00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:52.510
just listen.
Oh,

875
00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:58.710
multiple personality.
Trauma induced.
Is that what it says?
Uh,
no,
I'm,

876
00:50:58.711 --> 00:51:00.910
I'm a Google in that Sar Bible,

877
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:05.390
but I believe it did have something to do with it.
Yeah.
Trauma induced.
Yeah,

878
00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:07.340
no kidding.
Yeah.

879
00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:14.730
This sorta usually has its roots roots in childhood trauma.
Oh.

880
00:51:14.731 --> 00:51:19.200
So it could be an emotional trauma to,
it could be that simple.
Had that.
Yeah.

881
00:51:19.350 --> 00:51:22.830
Okay.
You remember civil?
Yes.
Very dear friend of mine,

882
00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:27.980
Bobby and I used to get brunch.
Hey,

883
00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:32.640
Stepford wives at the Beverly Hills Hotel.
Um,

884
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:34.600
<v 0>okay.</v>

885
00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:36.180
<v 5>Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
We'll,</v>

886
00:51:36.181 --> 00:51:39.910
he's talking also about how he became a completely different guy when he was

887
00:51:39.911 --> 00:51:40.744
playing.

888
00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:42.723
<v 0>Okay.</v>

889
00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:47.060
<v 5>Right.
Yeah.
He said his exact quote was,</v>

890
00:51:47.061 --> 00:51:49.940
you don't want the Hershel that plays football babysitting your child.

891
00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:52.770
He's not crazy.
I'll put that baby.

892
00:51:52.771 --> 00:51:55.700
She imagine that coming out of Hershel Walker's mouth.
How scary that would be.

893
00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:59.510
No,
you do.
You do not want the Hershel that plays football.

894
00:51:59.511 --> 00:52:03.830
Babysitting your child,
even though they would think of that.
Yeah.

895
00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:05.780
Well he was,
he's ruthless.
I mean,

896
00:52:05.781 --> 00:52:09.080
I think to get that good at something like as good as Herschel Walker,

897
00:52:09.081 --> 00:52:09.920
was it football?
Yeah.

898
00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:13.580
I really do believe that madness and excellence are just next door and Amaris.

899
00:52:13.610 --> 00:52:16.780
I really do.
I think in order to,
to hit the,

900
00:52:16.781 --> 00:52:20.750
the levels of proficiency that those guys hit,
like the true greats,

901
00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:25.190
like a guy like Jordan Jordan is a good example cause he's fucking crazy.
Yeah,

902
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:26.360
of course.
One of those guys,

903
00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:29.120
like when he did his acceptance speech for the hall of fame,

904
00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:33.980
he was B was complaining about people who rejected him can instead of taking it

905
00:52:33.981 --> 00:52:38.380
going,
hey,
I'm number one,
he,
he came,
came angry at it.
Wow.
That's so crazy.

906
00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:41.780
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well there's a lot of people that,
you know,
they never,

907
00:52:41.781 --> 00:52:46.310
they never find peace there.
Their life is always chasing something,

908
00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:50.960
chasing,
you know,
a wind chasing a victory,
chasing,
uh,
whatever the fuck.

909
00:52:50.961 --> 00:52:52.580
And I love that about standup Joe.

910
00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:56.300
Like we can get better until we get fucking cocked on the head.
It's true.

911
00:52:56.420 --> 00:53:00.970
But no matter what Jordan does,
no matter what nutrition he can go visit the,
the,

912
00:53:00.971 --> 00:53:03.380
you know,
the monks and they,
Paul,

913
00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:06.260
nothing's going to make him Michael Jordan again.
Yeah,

914
00:53:06.261 --> 00:53:08.810
the physical Bonnie Wayne's a lot quicker than the mine,

915
00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:13.690
but we're going to be shitting our pants and dying in fear.
Just like,
Hey,

916
00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:14.690
you'll be walking me.

917
00:53:15.050 --> 00:53:18.740
You'll come and visit me at the home before he'll come and visit you.
Well,

918
00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:21.440
who knows?
Who knows how we all go,
but it's not going to be,

919
00:53:21.650 --> 00:53:22.550
it's not going to be good.

920
00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:29.490
But Herschel is a at 48 years old,
it's fucking shredded,
shredded.
He,

921
00:53:29.491 --> 00:53:32.100
I don't know if he's going to fight again,
but he's had a bunch of MMA fights.

922
00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:33.090
I think he said three.

923
00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:36.450
Well he's the one that used to do like 2000 sit ups and the downs does still

924
00:53:36.451 --> 00:53:40.110
does that crazy shit.
He's all does all calisthenics.
They just fucking,

925
00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:44.490
just a freak.
He's so God damn strong.
He texts these guys like,
I mean,
he's good.

926
00:53:44.491 --> 00:53:45.870
He's physically talented like a,

927
00:53:45.871 --> 00:53:48.630
I know he's like a brag black belt in some martial arts,

928
00:53:48.631 --> 00:53:51.780
karate or taekwondo or something along those lines so you physically knows how

929
00:53:51.781 --> 00:53:54.750
to kick and punch.
And then,
you know,
he's been training at Aka,

930
00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:57.300
which is a big gym up in San Jose.

931
00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:00.990
One of the like big gyms in the country as far as MMA is concerned.

932
00:54:00.991 --> 00:54:05.610
Like Josh Koscheck came out of there.
John Fitch.
Um,

933
00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:10.050
a lot of good guys.
Like real good.
Uh,
Gilbert Melendez.
Uh,
no.
Excuse me.

934
00:54:10.051 --> 00:54:11.230
Josh Thomson Rather,
uh,

935
00:54:11.250 --> 00:54:14.460
came out of there and Gilbert Melendez and him just fought this past weekend.

936
00:54:14.461 --> 00:54:17.430
Fucking incredible fight.
Holy Shit.
That was amazing.

937
00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:21.150
When do you announce a fight again?
Uh,
this weekend.
This upcoming weekend.

938
00:54:21.210 --> 00:54:25.860
Whereas Vegas,
fuck,
I love it.
I think you're so fucking good at that.
It's fun.

939
00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:29.760
Well thanks.
It's a,
it's,
I don't make it make it the Sami Moreland show,

940
00:54:29.761 --> 00:54:33.450
but he was really,
you really break it down and you make people understand that.

941
00:54:33.451 --> 00:54:37.440
Like I told you that before.
It's like so much fun because your enthusiasm,

942
00:54:37.441 --> 00:54:40.410
but you know what you're talking about.
But you're not above like,

943
00:54:40.411 --> 00:54:42.270
I don't even know what the fuck some guys are talking about.

944
00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:45.150
He threw a right Kloss Sangha,
you know they're making,
yeah,

945
00:54:45.151 --> 00:54:48.510
there's a little of that that goes on where they get like real sports specific.

946
00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:51.600
I will say like,
he hit him with the three,
two and you know,
dig in with the five.

947
00:54:51.601 --> 00:54:52.171
Like,
come on man.

948
00:54:52.171 --> 00:54:55.780
How many motherfuckers out there watching at home know what a five is?
You know,

949
00:54:55.830 --> 00:54:57.240
I don't know.
It's,
it's,

950
00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:01.400
but punches are w one is the jab to a straight run.
Okay.

951
00:55:01.450 --> 00:55:05.680
Three's and left hook fours.
Right.
Africa it depending on who wins this time.
Huh?

952
00:55:05.810 --> 00:55:08.370
Sorry.
Probably will live her.
Huh?
I don't know.
I don't even know what it is.

953
00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:12.700
He can't go that far and not taught me to fight.
Well what he,
you know,
they'll,

954
00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:13.920
they'll go as far as,
uh,

955
00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:17.400
like trying too hard to get a lot of like sports guys that do that.

956
00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:21.030
They're like try too hard to like use the correct phrases.

957
00:55:21.570 --> 00:55:23.910
They'll say like exotic shape,
they'll get it wrong.

958
00:55:23.911 --> 00:55:27.990
Like this is a Kamora what's now Americana?
It's quoting me,
you know,

959
00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:31.020
it's different situation.
See how the grip is.
It's totally different.

960
00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:34.180
But you know,
they're,
they're calling it out anyway cause it sounds like the,

961
00:55:34.181 --> 00:55:38.400
the cool sports guy thing to know that the,
the Omoplata is a good one.

962
00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:40.020
There's a guy never know how to say that.

963
00:55:40.030 --> 00:55:41.880
There's a guy named Walt Frazier who was an old guy.

964
00:55:41.881 --> 00:55:45.230
He's played for the Knicks and he announces Knicks Games and he does that.
Yeah.

965
00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:48.630
Does it was,
you know,
juxtaposition of the materialistic

966
00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:52.380
grocer.

967
00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:55.770
Remember when Dennis Miller used to make references like to the Tigris and

968
00:55:55.771 --> 00:55:59.490
Euphrates river,
these fucking guys in Pittsburgh or watching the game drinking.

969
00:55:59.491 --> 00:56:02.010
But what you're talking about the blood,

970
00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:05.520
Dennis Miller had the weirdest act going on for a long time when he was on

971
00:56:05.521 --> 00:56:07.430
Monday night football.
I'm talking about Oh yeah,
he,

972
00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:09.530
well he pissed a lot of people off on that didn't he?

973
00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:13.230
Because he was trying to like insert jokes into it.
Yeah.
But I mean also,

974
00:56:13.231 --> 00:56:14.730
but his references and they,
you know,

975
00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:19.150
they're like one time I did enjoy his first two specialties.

976
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:23.040
A good like his first,
he before it became all crazy.
Right.
Winger,

977
00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.220
you've got a little deep end.

978
00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:28.050
<v 6>Little after nine 11 ish,
he went a little pro Bush ish.
But uh,</v>

979
00:56:28.090 --> 00:56:31.720
you go back to like his earlier stuff,
he's fucking,
there's a very funny comic,

980
00:56:31.721 --> 00:56:35.230
you know,
it's amazing.
I was asking one of the a writer and you know,
the guy,

981
00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:38.260
and I won't say I'm on the air,
but he wrote for dentists,

982
00:56:38.290 --> 00:56:43.060
Jon Stewart and Bill Maher and he said by far Dennis was the most decent guy to

983
00:56:43.061 --> 00:56:46.210
work with.
He's a great guy to talk to him after his radio show a few times.

984
00:56:46.211 --> 00:56:48.730
He's a great guy to talk.
Yeah,
he is.
You know,

985
00:56:48.731 --> 00:56:52.480
I would notice a lot of guys that I enjoy talking to her.

986
00:56:52.481 --> 00:56:56.140
Like there's a guy named Sam Harris that I had on the podcast and he's very much

987
00:56:56.141 --> 00:57:00.910
like,
I thought he was a,
he's a,
he's a,
he's a brilliant dude,

988
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:05.110
but um,
he shares a lot of like,
uh,

989
00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:07.530
a lot of the same sort of,
uh,

990
00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:11.450
ideas that a lot of right wing people share like about like the,

991
00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:15.100
the good ideas about war and the good things that we're doing,

992
00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:18.910
like going over to these other countries and the ignoring and the minimalizing

993
00:57:18.911 --> 00:57:23.790
all the bad shit and ignoring and minimalizing all the damage that it does to

994
00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:27.990
the societies and the fact that people are profiting from it.
See,

995
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.370
I would just like it explain to me like the way he was saying,

996
00:57:30.371 --> 00:57:35.170
you explain a martial arts am a rather,
uh,
I was just like,

997
00:57:35.171 --> 00:57:38.530
somebody explained to me why we're in Afghanistan.
What,
what the whole purpose.

998
00:57:38.531 --> 00:57:40.520
I don't know.
I still don't fucking know it.

999
00:57:40.530 --> 00:57:45.530
It's a massive mind fuck if you really sit down with someone who tells you on

1000
00:57:46.031 --> 00:57:48.330
one side that,
uh,
it's a,

1001
00:57:48.331 --> 00:57:52.030
an important thing as far as stabilizing that region and keeping out Haida from

1002
00:57:52.031 --> 00:57:55.320
getting a stronghold and blah,
blah.
But I,
Buh Buh Buh.
You know,
you,

1003
00:57:55.321 --> 00:57:58.810
you can listen to that and you go,
wow,
okay,
I see the point.
You know,
maybe,

1004
00:57:58.930 --> 00:58:02.230
maybe our military is working hard to keep us safe and they know better than us

1005
00:58:02.231 --> 00:58:03.970
and you know,
that's why they're there and they know,

1006
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:05.260
they know that there's a threat there.

1007
00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:08.200
But then when you look at it on the other side and you go,
you know,

1008
00:58:08.201 --> 00:58:12.820
you talked to someone who is a very educated in the history of the ways of this

1009
00:58:12.821 --> 00:58:13.510
country,

1010
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:18.040
and they explain to you what's most likely going on is that there's resources

1011
00:58:18.041 --> 00:58:20.920
over there that we need to control whatever the fuck it is.
Yeah.

1012
00:58:20.921 --> 00:58:24.280
The Russians couldn't beat him.
They could walk there.
Yeah.
Well we're,

1013
00:58:24.281 --> 00:58:27.250
apparently we were supposed to leave now,
you know,
that's what Obama saying.

1014
00:58:27.251 --> 00:58:27.710
You know,

1015
00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:30.220
Obama was having these things while he's running for reelection where he's

1016
00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:33.590
sitting down with Karzai,
who by the way,
Karzai's brother,
uh,

1017
00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:36.460
got he got somehow or another,

1018
00:58:36.461 --> 00:58:40.990
he got busted cell being in cahoots with the,
the,
the,
uh,

1019
00:58:41.010 --> 00:58:46.010
the opium dealers down in Afghanistan and he was getting CIA money.

1020
00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:49.630
So this guy was like working with the opium trade,

1021
00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:54.760
getting CIA money when he's the brother,
the president of Afghanistan course.

1022
00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:58.200
But it's amazing how it's,
you don't even have to look for,

1023
00:58:58.210 --> 00:58:59.830
it's not like six degrees of Kevin Bacon.

1024
00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:04.540
It's like his fucking brother is in there with no degrees.
It's right there.

1025
00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:08.710
You know what,
man?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I look at both sides.

1026
00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:12.670
Both arguments of of the pro argument is very shaky in my opinion,

1027
00:59:12.970 --> 00:59:16.570
but I can understand this that I'm who,
same paranoia,
but the Afghanistan,

1028
00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:19.460
my brother Joe's a colonel in the marines.
I think the,

1029
00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:23.450
the thing is the worried about al Qaeda taking control of the era of the
Taliban,

1030
00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:26.060
taking control of the,
the,
the resources.

1031
00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:29.390
Apparently the idea is that there's a lot of money to be made and that they

1032
00:59:29.391 --> 00:59:31.670
don't have oil though has gotten us a lot of minerals.

1033
00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:35.660
A lot of men have trillions of dollars,
a minerals and there's natural gas.

1034
00:59:35.661 --> 00:59:38.600
That's what the Soviets were trying to control and then there's the opium trade

1035
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:42.320
that people don't want to believe it.
But that's the reality is the,

1036
00:59:42.321 --> 00:59:43.640
the poppies,

1037
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:47.840
the production has gone up through the fucking roof since America occupied.

1038
00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:51.380
I mean the,
all,
all the statistics are available online.
You know,
you can,

1039
00:59:51.381 --> 00:59:54.010
you can look at it.
People don't want to believe it,
but this,

1040
00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:55.520
they're not stopping it.
No one,

1041
00:59:55.550 --> 00:59:59.240
no one in the United States that goes over there and none of those army guys are

1042
00:59:59.241 --> 01:00:01.400
stopping the production of poppies.
In fact,

1043
01:00:01.401 --> 01:00:05.390
they're guarding poppy fields and that's a fact.
Americans are guarding,

1044
01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:08.480
guarding poppy fields.
That's hilarious.
People don't believe it.

1045
01:00:08.481 --> 01:00:11.600
Brion pull that shit up because we've,
we've had this on the podcast before.

1046
01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:16.400
That's how people heard about this before.
It's a nutty situation.

1047
01:00:16.401 --> 01:00:19.730
I don't,
and a lot of that stuff,
you know,
I don't know what they use it for.

1048
01:00:19.731 --> 01:00:21.350
If it's for pharmaceutical drugs,

1049
01:00:21.351 --> 01:00:24.560
which there that is a legitimate use bagels for that stuff.

1050
01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:27.800
Or if it's getting sold right into the heroin market,
I don't fucking know.

1051
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:31.010
But to pretend that this isn't a factor,
that these trillions of dollars,

1052
01:00:31.011 --> 01:00:33.650
I old please conspiracy theory,
blah blah blah.

1053
01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:37.070
You're talking about something that generates just fucking insane amounts of

1054
01:00:37.071 --> 01:00:41.900
money.
Insane amounts of money.
And I wonder how much it has,
how much pressure,

1055
01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:43.760
something like this,
like some sort of a,

1056
01:00:43.761 --> 01:00:48.080
a business venture like this has on the introduction and the legalization of

1057
01:00:48.081 --> 01:00:50.090
other drugs in this country.
You know,

1058
01:00:50.091 --> 01:00:54.200
the only way they could pull off a heroin deal like this is if heroin is
illegal.

1059
01:00:54.290 --> 01:00:58.640
So everything gets moved in under the table.
Everything gets snuck in through,

1060
01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:03.770
you know,
a prearranged shipping routes.
Everything's clean,
desk dine,
you know?

1061
01:01:03.771 --> 01:01:07.570
That's really the only way to do it because otherwise other people are going to

1062
01:01:07.571 --> 01:01:11.630
do it.
Are we still getting hopium from Afghanistan?
Of course we are.

1063
01:01:11.810 --> 01:01:15.100
We must get through.
Where's it going?
Well,
I will look there.

1064
01:01:15.101 --> 01:01:19.190
They're making 90 plus percent of the world's opium in Afghanistan.

1065
01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:22.850
90 plus percent.
There's deaths.
That's insane.

1066
01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:25.580
I mean just that number alone is almost like a joke.

1067
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:27.680
It's almost like this is a comic book.

1068
01:01:27.790 --> 01:01:32.490
Then we find out that the bad guy lives in a place where all the opium is and we

1069
01:01:32.491 --> 01:01:35.760
got to let these people grow.
The bad guy is the opium.
How bout that?

1070
01:01:35.761 --> 01:01:39.000
Help him takes care of the schools.
Just like in Botswana,
the diamonds to help.

1071
01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:42.500
They want to have find the enemy.
In Afghanistan it's heroin.
That's the enemy,

1072
01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:44.660
but if you like it,
go for it.

1073
01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:48.230
Especially if you're a musician because they make good shit when they're on

1074
01:01:48.231 --> 01:01:49.400
heroin.
A lot of them.
Do

1075
01:01:51.490 --> 01:01:54.750
you know Eric Clapton was just when he was on heroin?
Yeah,

1076
01:01:54.751 --> 01:01:56.300
I mentioned Hendrix before,

1077
01:01:56.390 --> 01:02:01.040
but apparently I've been corrected that a Hendrix didn't do heroin until after

1078
01:02:01.041 --> 01:02:02.210
he made his music.

1079
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:06.290
He put out his studio albums and then he started fucking around with heroin

1080
01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:09.890
overdose.
He died on a bunch of Shit,
man.

1081
01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:13.700
And there's a lot of people that believe that he was murdered.
Like his,
his,
um,

1082
01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:18.610
former manager had a,
as a,
as a roadie and uh,
the road,

1083
01:02:18.611 --> 01:02:20.250
he just released a book

1084
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:24.090
<v 5>about it.
And the Roadie I think was also an abandoned self when he was younger,</v>

1085
01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:27.240
like the animals or something like that.
Oh yeah.
And this,

1086
01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:31.830
I think that's the story.
And anyway,
the Roadie,
um,
apparently said that,

1087
01:02:31.890 --> 01:02:34.780
uh,
Jimmy,
uh,
had,
uh,

1088
01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:39.210
like a really fucking dangerous manager and his manager was like mob connected

1089
01:02:39.211 --> 01:02:41.040
and shit.
And he did a lot of fucked up things.

1090
01:02:41.041 --> 01:02:43.950
And one of the things he claims he did was kidnapped Jimi Hendrix,

1091
01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:47.340
his own manager had guys kidnapped Jimmy.

1092
01:02:47.341 --> 01:02:49.080
And leave him in a hotel for three days.

1093
01:02:49.170 --> 01:02:53.670
And then he rescued him in quotes to show him how powerful he is,

1094
01:02:53.850 --> 01:02:57.210
how he can get anything done.
And they all like,
please show we didn't,

1095
01:02:57.230 --> 01:03:00.840
we didn't know he was with you then.
I own this guy.
You stay with me,
Jimmy,

1096
01:03:00.841 --> 01:03:04.440
I'll protect you from these guys.
Well apparently he also had like,
you know,

1097
01:03:04.441 --> 01:03:08.760
there was a big life insurance policy that they're saying was a on Jimi Hendrix

1098
01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:12.780
down that the,
the,
the,
the veracity of that,
I don't know,
you'd have to check.

1099
01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:16.500
I'm not really into it enough to,
I went to Wikipedia,

1100
01:03:16.530 --> 01:03:21.000
the latest who died in the,
who the fuck knows,
you know.

1101
01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:24.120
But the other thing was the Jimmy Hendrix,
a girlfriend at the time,

1102
01:03:24.121 --> 01:03:24.960
she was killed.

1103
01:03:25.290 --> 01:03:30.090
Somebody threw her off the top of a roof of a building in somewhere in New York.

1104
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:34.320
But the speculation was that that had to do with Jimi Hendrix,
his death.

1105
01:03:34.890 --> 01:03:38.160
You know,
if you wanted to paint a beautiful,
uh,
conspiracy mystery,

1106
01:03:38.161 --> 01:03:40.710
and that's how you would go with it.
Whether or not that's true or not.

1107
01:03:40.830 --> 01:03:44.100
My favorite conspiracy was it goes back to Michael Jordan and they said that

1108
01:03:44.430 --> 01:03:49.080
because he didn't pay a lot of is a golf bets.
Oh yeah.
Well that was a big thing.

1109
01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:52.050
That was the other was killed over the,
Oh my God.
Yeah.
They,

1110
01:03:52.051 --> 01:03:55.290
let's father was killed in North Carolina.
Oh my God.

1111
01:03:55.291 --> 01:03:57.890
I said that was connected to them.
Who,
you know,
who knows.
Um,

1112
01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:01.050
so many conspiracy theories,
but holy shit,
that's scary.

1113
01:04:01.090 --> 01:04:03.630
He was a big gambler and none of that.
Well,
I know there was a,

1114
01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:07.440
an article that was written in like Esquire or one of those,

1115
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:12.150
it was ask why or maybe vanity fair.
I don't remember what magazine it was,
but,

1116
01:04:12.151 --> 01:04:15.540
uh,
it was,
uh,
an article that was written by a guy who was a,

1117
01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:20.460
a golf hustler who,
uh,
Michael Jordan owed like a half a million.
Yeah.

1118
01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:21.353
He never paid up.

1119
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:25.550
I heard it goes to places and bars and has dinner and doesn't pay just because

1120
01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:29.580
they,
you know,
he graced them with his presence.
Wow.
Really?
It doesn't tip,

1121
01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:33.180
they call Scotty Pippin.
No tip in Pippin.
Yeah,
I heard that.

1122
01:04:33.330 --> 01:04:35.030
That's so unfortunate.
It's,

1123
01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:39.090
it's amazing that a guy can get so successful and still be so selfish,

1124
01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:41.460
you know?
Maybe it's just,

1125
01:04:41.461 --> 01:04:45.120
he works so fucking hard that he just thinks everybody else's shit.

1126
01:04:47.410 --> 01:04:51.360
He's such a hard work.
Any bad ass motherfucker that everybody else is like,

1127
01:04:51.361 --> 01:04:53.550
bitch,
you want money for serving me?
Right.

1128
01:04:53.551 --> 01:04:57.570
The irony is he has the worst team in the history of basketball this year.
Oh,

1129
01:04:57.571 --> 01:05:01.350
he owns a team.
Bobcat's and there were the worst team ever.
Wow.

1130
01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:02.910
But he went from the being the groom split,
you know,

1131
01:05:02.970 --> 01:05:06.780
arguably the greatest player to the worst general manager over a wonder if he's,

1132
01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:09.810
do you think he's not a good owner or do I just doesn't have good,

1133
01:05:10.530 --> 01:05:13.800
I think he's got that syndrome where you remember the Al Capone thing where

1134
01:05:13.801 --> 01:05:16.020
everybody would laugh when he left and stopped when he stopped.

1135
01:05:16.050 --> 01:05:18.040
I think he has that a lot of yes.
People around

1136
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:21.330
<v 3>them.
So nobody says no.
So he makes moves that he's,</v>

1137
01:05:21.490 --> 01:05:24.850
he doesn't really know what he's doing,
but there's nobody to confront him.

1138
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.250
Nobody has the balls to confront him.
I think that's part of the problem.

1139
01:05:27.370 --> 01:05:30.280
<v 6>Yeah.
That's the thing that people always look for.</v>

1140
01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:32.410
The people always look for sycophants.

1141
01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:35.140
You know when you want to want to see a guy who was falling apart,

1142
01:05:35.170 --> 01:05:38.080
it looked towards a sycophants.
Yeah.
If you want to insult guys,

1143
01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:42.580
you call them sycophants right now,
which is always hilarious.

1144
01:05:42.581 --> 01:05:46.810
Like guys can't be friends now if one guy is more successful than the other,

1145
01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:51.070
while the rest are just sicker fans in the morons mine that,
that,

1146
01:05:51.071 --> 01:05:54.220
that's the conversation that comes up so that,
you know,

1147
01:05:54.221 --> 01:05:58.210
that's like demeaning to like all the other guys that hang out with a guy,

1148
01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:03.040
you know?
Yeah.
You find people change toward you in some ways.

1149
01:06:05.130 --> 01:06:06.910
Like in what way?
What do you mean?
Well,

1150
01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:10.480
deferring to you because they think they can get something or anything.
Well,

1151
01:06:10.481 --> 01:06:14.190
there's going to always be people that are weird man,
that just,
they're there,

1152
01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:17.230
they're trying to hustle,

1153
01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:21.280
they're trying to sell something and they want to get close to you because they

1154
01:06:21.281 --> 01:06:23.410
think it would be advantageous to them.
And you know,

1155
01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:27.070
there's this people that they,
they give it away,
man.
They give it away quick.

1156
01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:29.080
<v 3>I didn't find that out yet.</v>

1157
01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:31.900
People kind of hit on me for stuff that I really don't,
I can't,

1158
01:06:32.110 --> 01:06:33.580
I can't write them a strong act.

1159
01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:37.390
And of you think you could sit down right with me.
You're right.

1160
01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:41.320
It was just funny.
But I mean sometimes I think people want stuff that I,

1161
01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:43.240
I'm not even powerful enough to give him,

1162
01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:45.610
<v 6>you know,
one thing.
What would it be cool to do a,</v>

1163
01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:47.160
and I have thought about doing this before,

1164
01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:52.220
I think it would be really a ton of a fun thing to have guys like you and me and

1165
01:06:52.771 --> 01:06:55.440
maybe Stan hope or you know,
someone,
someone,

1166
01:06:55.650 --> 01:06:57.810
someone else weird along those lines.

1167
01:06:57.820 --> 01:07:00.040
Have like a series of guys have Joey Diaz do someone,

1168
01:07:00.041 --> 01:07:04.830
Ari Shaffir do something and um,
have it.
So comics will have like a meeting.

1169
01:07:04.831 --> 01:07:06.240
It felt like the,
you know,
the

1170
01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:11.010
<v 3>Prov on like Saturday at like five in the afternoon and we'll just answer any</v>

1171
01:07:11.011 --> 01:07:13.470
questions.
Oh yeah.
Wouldn't that be great?

1172
01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:17.010
Imagine if you were a guy had been doing comedy a year and a,

1173
01:07:17.011 --> 01:07:20.250
you could talk to the you of today just to ask you,
what do you do to,

1174
01:07:20.310 --> 01:07:22.770
what do you do?
How do you,
how do you get started?
What do you write about?

1175
01:07:22.771 --> 01:07:25.640
How do you write,
do you write it down?
Do you write bullet points?
What do you do?

1176
01:07:25.650 --> 01:07:28.320
Do you have the practice of deep practice it in order,

1177
01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:30.840
deep practice alone at home or only on stage,

1178
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.380
the same order every time I had a guy,
it's been,

1179
01:07:33.381 --> 01:07:36.330
and it was so disappointed that I just told them the reality.
He said,

1180
01:07:36.331 --> 01:07:38.940
how do you get on the tonight show and those kinds of shows.
I said,
well,

1181
01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:40.640
the first,
you know,

1182
01:07:40.650 --> 01:07:44.190
the most important thing is very hard to write those sets cause I'm like you,

1183
01:07:44.550 --> 01:07:48.300
I'm more free form and I don't like to write tight sets.
And I mean,

1184
01:07:48.430 --> 01:07:50.490
but it's hard.
And he's,
I said,
you know,

1185
01:07:50.491 --> 01:07:52.460
you haven't really have to write him and you know,

1186
01:07:52.490 --> 01:07:56.450
construct them so that there are only five minutes.
And he goes,
you got to write.

1187
01:07:57.060 --> 01:07:58.470
I go,
well yeah.
What do you think you'd do?

1188
01:07:58.471 --> 01:08:02.850
Call up to president and show business and ask him for a favor.
It got it right.

1189
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.010
What the fuck?
I didn't expect that.

1190
01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:09.600
<v 6>Yeah.
Some people don't like writing.
I write in my head.
I uh,
I,</v>

1191
01:08:09.601 --> 01:08:13.910
I've done that before and I'm not nearly as prolific.
I got to sit down prolific.

1192
01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:15.980
Well because you're working much till you

1193
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:20.330
<v 5>were so busy with my,
you know,
it seems like a lot of work,</v>

1194
01:08:20.331 --> 01:08:23.480
but everything that I do is fun.
So it doesn't seem like work at all.

1195
01:08:23.481 --> 01:08:25.740
Still time consuming.
It's time consuming.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1196
01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:29.060
I mean it's very hard to crack the starting line,
don't you think?

1197
01:08:29.061 --> 01:08:31.940
Like you just got to do it.
The harder it is for me,

1198
01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:34.370
it's the better you get and the more strong shit you have,

1199
01:08:34.670 --> 01:08:37.610
the harder it is to break the starting line because you're thinking,
oh fuck,

1200
01:08:37.611 --> 01:08:40.610
I don't want to put that in.
It's not strong enough.
Well,
once you get it down,

1201
01:08:40.611 --> 01:08:44.720
like you get like an opening bid or a whole chunk down like fucking hard and

1202
01:08:44.721 --> 01:08:47.960
Japanese Samurai sword just folded over and

1203
01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:54.740
just Polish that bitch down to its lethal till just till it's perfect,
you know?

1204
01:08:54.741 --> 01:08:58.790
And you don't want to let it go,
but unfortunately you have to.
It's no other way.

1205
01:08:58.950 --> 01:09:03.200
Yeah.
We're doing a show here at the ice house Wednesday night.

1206
01:09:03.650 --> 01:09:06.660
Um,
what do you,
do you do anything Wednesday?
Um,
um,

1207
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:11.600
I have one spot of the store.
What's up?
10 o'clock show.
We're doing a show here.

1208
01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:15.920
I'll come on.
We do set.
Sure.
What time's your spot?
The store?
10 o'clock.

1209
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:20.900
[inaudible] Megan.
Yeah,
you could do it just late if you just do your set there.

1210
01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:24.890
And then if this source not too late as tour,
sometimes running late,

1211
01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:28.010
I can get along.
I can who sometimes don't even start at 10 o'clock.

1212
01:09:28.011 --> 01:09:31.010
We'll start like 10,
10.
We're crazy.
What's going to go to,

1213
01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:34.190
it'll go till at least midnight,
right?
Well if you come,
you know,
and,

1214
01:09:34.191 --> 01:09:37.670
and I'm moderating already on stage.
I'll bring her on stage.
All right.

1215
01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:41.050
And we can fuck around.
Okay.
Or do you just do your actor?
I mean,
I'll,

1216
01:09:41.051 --> 01:09:43.790
I'll introduce you at anytime.
Anytime you get here,
we'll throw you up.

1217
01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:46.070
That'd be awesome.
To the benefit.
No,
we're fucking around.

1218
01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:50.690
How much we're going to have a podcast at nine out of 10 and that's May 23rd.

1219
01:09:50.691 --> 01:09:52.310
If you're listening.
Yeah.

1220
01:09:52.311 --> 01:09:54.950
So if you're listening to this later and you want to come down the ice house,

1221
01:09:55.330 --> 01:09:56.960
can I plug a couple of days?
Please do.

1222
01:09:57.290 --> 01:10:02.210
I got Atlanta June 15th and 16th or they get a punch line.
Oh,
great club.

1223
01:10:02.330 --> 01:10:06.410
And uh,
when a big Gig for me,
because it goes to Philly,
is June 30th,

1224
01:10:06.411 --> 01:10:11.060
I'm at the Tropicana and the big room upstairs,
Tropicana in Atlantic city,

1225
01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:15.430
which I love.
I do love Atlantic city.
Well for me.
So we got,

1226
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:19.550
we got all the fuck in a tie.
It's coming from Hamilton,
the mayor and everybody.

1227
01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:21.800
Well,
you know,
you,
uh,

1228
01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:26.390
you're one of those guys that you never stuck with the same act.
You know,

1229
01:10:26.391 --> 01:10:27.320
you're not one of those guys.

1230
01:10:27.321 --> 01:10:31.160
We'd go see him like three years later and you'll see the same shit verbatim

1231
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:35.550
near always.
It was always writing.
You're always,
I fucking try it.
Love it.

1232
01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:39.890
You love it.
You're a,
you're a real comic man.
You're a real craftsmen.
You know,

1233
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:43.790
you,
you,
you could not have picked a better occupation.
It's not like dom,

1234
01:10:43.791 --> 01:10:46.700
every era should have been a plumber,
should have been an electrician,

1235
01:10:46.810 --> 01:10:49.190
should've been a doctor.
Whatever the fuck it was like.
It's the one thing,

1236
01:10:49.970 --> 01:10:53.760
my lack of talent.
Many things easier for me to focus.
Well you,

1237
01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:57.650
you've always loved comedy.
I mean since the moment I met you,

1238
01:10:57.651 --> 01:11:01.010
like we've had like so many conversations about comedy and I've got to see you

1239
01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:03.670
always working on shit and tightening shit.

1240
01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:07.260
Like you mean there's some guys and we all know them.
They just kind of this,

1241
01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:10.610
it comes a point in time.
They just start phoning it in.
But you never hit that,

1242
01:11:10.670 --> 01:11:13.980
you know,
you never hit that.
You're always,
even you.
Even that too.
You're always

1243
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:17.070
<v 1>saying like,
I'm trying to get better.
Like that's in your head all the time.</v>

1244
01:11:17.071 --> 01:11:19.160
Absolutely.
If you're not getting better,
you're getting worse.
Yeah.

1245
01:11:19.170 --> 01:11:21.870
I don't stay at the one spot.
And what the fuck are you doing?

1246
01:11:21.871 --> 01:11:23.730
If you're not getting better,
you know,
what the fuck are you doing?

1247
01:11:23.731 --> 01:11:26.610
Why are you wasting your time?
Why I do so many sets?
Yeah.

1248
01:11:27.310 --> 01:11:29.100
I mean that's the thing.
That was fun too.

1249
01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:31.750
It's fun thing to do and make people laugh as a fun time.

1250
01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:37.170
<v 5>New New rules.
My favorite.</v>

1251
01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:39.230
I wish it could reenact that bit.

1252
01:11:39.790 --> 01:11:43.480
<v 1>I love that bit.
That was a labor of love.
That bit.
There was a bit that I,</v>

1253
01:11:43.481 --> 01:11:47.590
that was a bit that I was it,
what's her name?
She,
Anna Nicole Smith.
Smith.
Yeah.

1254
01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:51.100
That was the bit that I was actually forbidden from saying at the comedy store.

1255
01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:52.910
Mitzi came up to me,

1256
01:11:57.370 --> 01:12:02.120
<v 5>show your fucking neck got longer.
Ooh.
The joke was</v>

1257
01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:06.390
<v 1>about,
you know,
there were,
everybody was like,
oh my God,
Anna Nicole Smith,</v>

1258
01:12:06.391 --> 01:12:10.020
she's marrying this old billionaire that's so horrible.

1259
01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:13.830
Like what she's doing is so terrible.
She's taken advantage of him.

1260
01:12:14.130 --> 01:12:16.470
And my joke is,
don't you think he fucking knows?

1261
01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:20.820
<v 5>He's 90 years old.
He made $1 billion from scratch.</v>

1262
01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:23.250
Chances are the dude's a tad crafty

1263
01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:29.130
and it was him getting her to do all this crazy fucked up shit or you wouldn't

1264
01:12:29.131 --> 01:12:32.880
give her money and it just give kidding,
nutty or 90 or as he was dying,

1265
01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:36.840
he wanted her to lick his ass screaming.
It's like,

1266
01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:41.220
it was one of my favorite bits to do because it was like there was like it was,

1267
01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:45.050
it felt justified.
You can get away with it.
I don't know.

1268
01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:49.080
You were talking about then how the new rules come in when he do something

1269
01:12:49.081 --> 01:12:53.850
perverted.
Oh yeah,
you can't do this in the hospital.
She says,
he goes,

1270
01:12:53.851 --> 01:12:57.810
look my ball and she says,
sugar,
I would love to stay here and be with you,

1271
01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:02.970
but that the visiting hours of between nine and 11 he goes,

1272
01:13:03.270 --> 01:13:04.080
no,

1273
01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:09.080
I just bought the hospital new rules like my ball 24 hours a day.

1274
01:13:11.970 --> 01:13:14.080
I love that.
Fuck a bit.
He would listen.

1275
01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:17.370
He would be in a wheelchair man and she'd be standing over him.

1276
01:13:17.371 --> 01:13:20.880
This insanely hot,
big titted gas model.

1277
01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:26.310
And you just look at it and go,
oh my God,
that fucking body.

1278
01:13:26.311 --> 01:13:31.070
She had just this insane fuck body giant Jayne Mansfield.

1279
01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:33.060
When those early pictures,

1280
01:13:33.061 --> 01:13:35.160
like when she was in playboy or whatever the fuck she did,

1281
01:13:35.161 --> 01:13:37.950
you look at her body and go,
Jesus Christ with a body,

1282
01:13:37.951 --> 01:13:42.951
that woman that just all voluptuous and legs and you know like you,

1283
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.580
when I like dom,
we don't like it.
No skinny broad.

1284
01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:47.250
I like a little meat on the bone,
you know,

1285
01:13:47.251 --> 01:13:51.910
I got a girl I can take a good fucking cause you know I deliver.
Oh,
I know.

1286
01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:57.030
I like the bang a and hit a wall the whole time.
I like to deliver.

1287
01:13:57.780 --> 01:13:59.400
Oh yeah.

1288
01:14:00.050 --> 01:14:02.900
<v 1>That's my best impression.
He's one of my best impressions,
right?</v>

1289
01:14:03.170 --> 01:14:06.050
I went to a strip club in Cleveland and it was one of the most,

1290
01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:11.320
like the name of the club was the name of the club was I Iran or it's

1291
01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:16.420
<v 2>sexy secret or something like that.
Something was something sexy,
secret,</v>

1292
01:14:16.421 --> 01:14:19.600
something secret and a it.
So I walk in and,

1293
01:14:19.610 --> 01:14:22.720
and I was the only white person in the whole entire clubs of like the secret
was,

1294
01:14:22.721 --> 01:14:26.710
I was the only thing,
you know,
it's,
but it was crazy.

1295
01:14:26.711 --> 01:14:29.040
I see chic secretive,
we go rob,

1296
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.210
but I immediately got swarmed like it was like Zombie style.

1297
01:14:34.211 --> 01:14:37.300
Like what you've one by one.
All the strippers like looked over.
I was like wow.

1298
01:14:37.310 --> 01:14:37.811
White Guy.

1299
01:14:37.811 --> 01:14:42.400
And it like came over and at one point I had like two girls on each,

1300
01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:44.080
like lap one girl give me me,

1301
01:14:44.081 --> 01:14:48.340
me and massage to can't support two girls on each leg.
That's ridiculous.

1302
01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:50.590
That's a lot of weight.
Huh?
Two girls on each leg.

1303
01:14:50.591 --> 01:14:55.240
So you've got four girls on your lap.
No,
no too.
I'm sorry.
I grow on each leg.
Oh,

1304
01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:57.280
and I'm sorry,
I'm at two girls.
Two girls,

1305
01:14:57.310 --> 01:15:00.370
one on each leg when it needs like a lot of weight too.

1306
01:15:00.371 --> 01:15:02.330
But that hurts after a while.
That's not,
yeah,

1307
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.750
they weren't very boney.
Yeah.
She,
you gotta step up.

1308
01:15:07.751 --> 01:15:09.430
Your fucking left leg is numb,
right.

1309
01:15:09.670 --> 01:15:12.220
Fall down and smash your face in the cocktail glass.

1310
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:17.310
But they just like took turns like putting their butts in my face and like it

1311
01:15:17.321 --> 01:15:22.321
was so much but like I felt but juice on my arms like Lego is moisturizer or

1312
01:15:22.571 --> 01:15:26.110
something like that.
After a while it was so hot in there.
But anyways,
yeah,

1313
01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:30.100
check out a black strip club in the ghetto sometime.
It's pretty weird.
You okay?

1314
01:15:31.010 --> 01:15:34.570
Well no it's really interesting like juice.
Did you

1315
01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:40.210
you lead,
let them sort of get but juice on,
you know all over the place.

1316
01:15:40.211 --> 01:15:42.510
The thing is,
you know how you got to like it,
like a normal strip club,

1317
01:15:42.511 --> 01:15:46.750
lego what you're used to and it's like it's,
it's all about like big boobs.

1318
01:15:46.751 --> 01:15:49.060
Perfect body,
nice bud or something right there.

1319
01:15:49.061 --> 01:15:53.680
It was all about huge fucking bubble acids.
Like just girls,

1320
01:15:53.681 --> 01:15:57.430
normal looking girls but with like ink I think but in plants or something it was

1321
01:15:57.431 --> 01:16:00.840
all about bucks.
Can I ask you something?
Have you ever been officially diagnosed?

1322
01:16:01.410 --> 01:16:02.243
<v 10>No.</v>

1323
01:16:05.410 --> 01:16:09.370
<v 2>I went to a strip club in Philly and it's black chick asked me for a lap dance</v>

1324
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:13.410
and I said,
no thanks you.
She said you're a racist.
And the book,

1325
01:16:13.570 --> 01:16:17.090
the Bouncer was black,
big guy.
And he knew me and I go,
what did he go?

1326
01:16:17.091 --> 01:16:19.420
What'd she say?
I,
as you said,
over racist.
What?

1327
01:16:19.421 --> 01:16:22.600
The fact that I don't think you're hot.
How rude.
Yeah.

1328
01:16:22.690 --> 01:16:26.170
How's that make me a racist thing to say to me while there you are.
Hold on.

1329
01:16:26.171 --> 01:16:30.940
Sorry.
Because we were all there.
You are arguing.
Let a stripper that's never win.

1330
01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:34.380
New thing to say when a stripper like what's happening to my license?
You Go,

1331
01:16:34.381 --> 01:16:35.350
I'm sorry.
I would love to.

1332
01:16:35.351 --> 01:16:39.010
But actually you look so much like my sister and that will freak me out.
Oh,

1333
01:16:39.011 --> 01:16:43.390
that's good.
So I said,
wow,
that's good.

1334
01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:47.950
Oh my God.
That guy,
I think he's really cute and he totally wanted to dance,

1335
01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:51.130
but I look like a sister and that is kinda creepy.
Yeah,

1336
01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:54.040
<v 10>that motherfucker.
He said,
I love magazines.</v>

1337
01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:56.860
<v 2>I'm going to start a fight in the dressing room.
Right.</v>

1338
01:16:57.140 --> 01:16:58.700
And then I'll come out and fucking shank you.

1339
01:16:59.690 --> 01:17:02.810
Maybe you were like that close to death and you don't even know.
No,

1340
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:05.990
I think I was fine.
It was,
it was,
it was pretty amazing.

1341
01:17:05.991 --> 01:17:07.940
Now how they just warm to me,

1342
01:17:07.941 --> 01:17:10.160
like all these other guys kind of getting pissed because

1343
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:14.300
<v 5>I committed to getting purse.
Yeah.
CLEVELAND,
it was like by the plats.</v>

1344
01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:18.280
I forget the name of Joe because I know it's a strip club there in front of
mind.

1345
01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:23.270
It gave lit this girl like $1,000 because you said she was studying classical

1346
01:17:23.271 --> 01:17:24.830
music,
some shit.

1347
01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:29.600
She believed him that he believed her wheeling can imagine she was studying like

1348
01:17:29.601 --> 01:17:34.340
the,
the oboe or something,
you know,
um,

1349
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:36.530
some high falutin musical school.

1350
01:17:36.531 --> 01:17:39.470
It can't even remember the name but Julliard or something,
you know,

1351
01:17:39.471 --> 01:17:41.780
it's like give me a fucking break.
You know,

1352
01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:47.260
how many girls do like are strippers and have like high functioning jobs on top

1353
01:17:47.721 --> 01:17:50.870
of that?
Not many.
Do you know,
there was like,
there's like a,
um,

1354
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:54.890
a check who got fired from somewhere,
I forget where she got fired from,

1355
01:17:55.190 --> 01:17:58.020
but she writes for like a local paper that you're,

1356
01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:01.040
I think it was like the Houston chronicle or something like that.
And she was,

1357
01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:03.770
she was writing a column,
but she was also like on the side,

1358
01:18:03.771 --> 01:18:06.140
she was a stripper and I found out,
so they fired her.

1359
01:18:06.170 --> 01:18:08.360
Somebody like turned around and so they fired her.
I,

1360
01:18:08.361 --> 01:18:11.810
you know what I think I would be if I was a woman in some extra cash,

1361
01:18:11.870 --> 01:18:14.970
first of all,
but anybody that would turn her in like that,
like I guess it's,

1362
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:18.350
if it's a moral thing,
you're silly and it,
it's not a moral thing.

1363
01:18:18.351 --> 01:18:21.290
You're a cunt white.
Why are you turning her in?
Like,
yeah,
there's no upside.

1364
01:18:21.291 --> 01:18:24.800
Why you?
Why are you getting her fired?
She's work ad person,
you know,

1365
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:27.200
she's just out there hustling.
I didn't give a fuck.

1366
01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:30.860
Just keep it yourself and now you can go see her naked.
What's wrong with you?

1367
01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:33.590
Right.
If you've got a weird thing with somebody,

1368
01:18:33.591 --> 01:18:38.090
the best thing to do is go visit them while they're naked.
Right?
Yeah.

1369
01:18:38.091 --> 01:18:39.050
Give resolve that shit.

1370
01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:43.310
I gotta Kinda stripper stripper bitch.

1371
01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:48.290
Like I'm serious.
Brian's like,
really man,

1372
01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:53.600
I'm trying to break down like the whole stripper and boyfriend relationship.

1373
01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:56.360
I'm trying to break it down.
Brian.
I'm trying to like,
uh,
you know,

1374
01:18:56.361 --> 01:18:57.620
you have to have a certain mentality.

1375
01:18:57.621 --> 01:19:00.920
If you're gonna date of girls and active stripper,
I can,

1376
01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:03.920
it really got to be able to let things go.
You gotta let things go.
Well,

1377
01:19:03.921 --> 01:19:05.810
how about those dudes that day?
Porn stars,

1378
01:19:06.210 --> 01:19:09.990
they're only allowed to fuck while you were at work.
Can't fuck.

1379
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:13.880
Yeah,
I'm the boss around here.
Have rules like that.

1380
01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:17.030
You're allowed to fuck people,
but only while you're working.

1381
01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:19.560
So these dudes just working all day every night.

1382
01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:23.360
Imagine she's a mother to like the mother of my children.

1383
01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:26.600
And then a lot of them are,
a lot of them are,
you know,
there's,

1384
01:19:26.601 --> 01:19:29.030
there's girls that they have babies and then look,
what are they going to do?

1385
01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:32.030
They can make a lot of money doing porn or they can make no money not doing
porn.

1386
01:19:32.330 --> 01:19:35.390
So they either do porn or they go into you feature dancing.

1387
01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:38.720
It's a fucking grind out there,
man,
for everybody.
You know?

1388
01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:42.560
And if you're a chick that's banked on your looks,
you know,
there's,

1389
01:19:42.561 --> 01:19:43.490
there's guys that,
uh,

1390
01:19:43.491 --> 01:19:46.140
they think they're going to be professional pitchers and they're fucking album

1391
01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:51.050
blows out.
Everybody makes a risky,
risky gamble in this life.
We're all one,

1392
01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:55.640
we're all one pitch away.
Yeah,
we are.
Yeah.
If you look at it that way,

1393
01:19:55.641 --> 01:20:00.050
dollar Joe Rogan,
I try to be as fair as possible,
don't you?

1394
01:20:00.710 --> 01:20:05.120
Yeah,
absolutely.
It's my life's about the balance of justice.

1395
01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:09.390
Yeah.
A balance of justice.
That's a good way of putting it.
You know,

1396
01:20:09.630 --> 01:20:14.630
I got offered to go in a coal mine and it was a mile and a half deep and I

1397
01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:19.500
declined it,
but he was telling me how you champ travel on this thing.

1398
01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:21.630
I forget where you lay back and you have your,
your,

1399
01:20:21.631 --> 01:20:25.230
you're laying on your back and you just go down this whole slowly,
you know,

1400
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:29.250
you know,
a mile down or something.
And uh,
he's like,
dude,
if you want to go,

1401
01:20:29.251 --> 01:20:33.540
we can totally do this whenever you want to.
You know.
And I was like,
fuck no,

1402
01:20:33.541 --> 01:20:38.310
I would,
I would rather not.
I'd rather try to commit suicide and then to do that.

1403
01:20:39.690 --> 01:20:42.460
That sounds scary as fuck.
Yeah.

1404
01:20:42.510 --> 01:20:45.390
Why are people into doing things that are really terrifying?
I don't know.

1405
01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:46.860
I don't think they have a choice.
Yeah.

1406
01:20:46.861 --> 01:20:49.650
Coal miners or can you imagine being a coal miner and no way that's it.

1407
01:20:49.651 --> 01:20:53.040
There's a show that they had on spike that I only could watch one episode

1408
01:20:53.041 --> 01:20:54.810
because it freaked me out so bad.
It was cool.

1409
01:20:54.811 --> 01:20:57.890
I think it was called coal and was a reality show about coal mining.

1410
01:20:57.900 --> 01:21:01.050
It's fucking terrifying.
There are deep,
deep,

1411
01:21:01.051 --> 01:21:04.830
deep inside just fucking mountain hope,
but it doesn't do this.
Boom.

1412
01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:08.220
They're pulling out giant chunks of it so they're going to make it brittle.

1413
01:21:08.490 --> 01:21:12.180
I mean,
and you know how brittle coal is anyway,
man.
When you feel cold,

1414
01:21:12.181 --> 01:21:16.950
you know brutal coal is coal breaks.
It's not like it's,
it's,
it's not steel.

1415
01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:18.260
You know when you feel it,

1416
01:21:18.270 --> 01:21:22.230
like you could chew into it with those machines and they pull it out of there.

1417
01:21:22.770 --> 01:21:24.840
He can crack and move and shit.

1418
01:21:24.850 --> 01:21:28.800
And about the guys that were down there and chill age.

1419
01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:33.360
There were beaten like a month or something.
Then they send them flashlights.

1420
01:21:33.361 --> 01:21:35.210
There'd be really no,

1421
01:21:36.690 --> 01:21:39.180
he imagined here's water and here,
fuck,

1422
01:21:39.181 --> 01:21:42.090
this is the first one as a candle so you can look each other in the eye while

1423
01:21:42.091 --> 01:21:43.860
you're doing it.
That's a butterfly.

1424
01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:49.060
You gotta you gotta Kinda cleaned it off though.
So save the water number.

1425
01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:52.500
One guy had a wife and a girlfriend.
They found out when he was there.

1426
01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:54.330
He's the guy's balling.
What are you gonna do

1427
01:21:56.060 --> 01:21:59.040
you imagine being in a situation where that's the only way you could feed your

1428
01:21:59.041 --> 01:22:02.280
family is to be,
you have to go to work in a mine.

1429
01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:06.510
That's really scary shit to be like one of the people that's responsible for

1430
01:22:06.511 --> 01:22:09.570
like pulling chunks out of the earth so that we can use it.

1431
01:22:09.870 --> 01:22:12.840
When you look at like humans in the relationship that we have to the earth,

1432
01:22:13.170 --> 01:22:17.160
it's so parasitic and strange and we never consider it that way.

1433
01:22:17.161 --> 01:22:18.900
We look at it as natural resources,

1434
01:22:18.901 --> 01:22:21.270
but if you looked at the earth is like a living organism.

1435
01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:25.530
We got to go inside of it and pull shit out of it that we use to light things on

1436
01:22:25.531 --> 01:22:26.820
fire.
On the surface,

1437
01:22:26.910 --> 01:22:31.140
we will literally have our whole society run on the blood of the earth.

1438
01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:32.880
The whole thing's run on oil.

1439
01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:37.950
Everything is run on some black liquid that is a fucking trillions of gallons of

1440
01:22:37.951 --> 01:22:41.970
it inside the earth and we're sucking it out and we're pretty sure it's finite.

1441
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:45.990
It has to be fine.
We don't even know what's going to happen.
If it is finite,

1442
01:22:46.850 --> 01:22:50.520
what happens there?
It's going to implode.
What's he's going to light on fire.

1443
01:22:50.521 --> 01:22:52.050
What the fuck's going to happen?
Is it gonna?

1444
01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:56.220
Is it gonna spin faster and will days we'll go shorter will die instantly or the

1445
01:22:56.221 --> 01:22:58.710
fuck knows that.
That's bad science.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1446
01:22:58.711 --> 01:23:01.890
I don't believe in any of that.
I don't want to get any angry Twitter messages.

1447
01:23:02.610 --> 01:23:06.010
The twilight zone.
I remember the morning sun,
the one

1448
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:10.750
<v 3>that the episode where they thought it was getting harder every day and because</v>

1449
01:23:10.751 --> 01:23:13.690
of the earth had fallen out of its elliptical orbit and it was coming closer and

1450
01:23:13.691 --> 01:23:16.390
closer to the sun and it was,
everything was stem.
Finally,

1451
01:23:16.391 --> 01:23:19.060
the painting started melting and they know who's over holy.

1452
01:23:19.061 --> 01:23:22.060
She wakes up and she finds out that just the opposite,

1453
01:23:22.090 --> 01:23:25.600
the earth is going farther away from the sun every day.
It's getting colder,

1454
01:23:25.810 --> 01:23:29.230
so it just shows the relative to the fragile existence,
which we have.
Anyway.

1455
01:23:29.470 --> 01:23:33.430
I'm Dom Arrera.
You guys have been great.
I liked the Obama crowd out.

1456
01:23:33.431 --> 01:23:37.510
A lot of guys that go for the left,
not me.
It is a,
it is true though.

1457
01:23:37.610 --> 01:23:38.670
We live in a delicate,
yeah,

1458
01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:41.900
<v 6>balance.
I mean you think about,
we don't experience it here in California,</v>

1459
01:23:41.901 --> 01:23:45.950
but when I lived in Boston or anybody on the east coast knows there's a vast

1460
01:23:45.951 --> 01:23:49.940
difference between what it's like to go outside in January and what it's like to

1461
01:23:49.941 --> 01:23:52.850
go outside in August.
A fucking world of difference.

1462
01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:54.990
<v 3>I'd rather have January,
which really?</v>

1463
01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:59.600
Well then I'd rather be in a 10 degrees on 110 for sure.
Really?
Oh yeah.

1464
01:23:59.630 --> 01:24:01.670
That's interesting.
Is that because of just,

1465
01:24:01.710 --> 01:24:04.730
you've spent too much time out here because they're gonna hate me,

1466
01:24:04.731 --> 01:24:08.970
so can I remind,
you know,
I just didn't ever,
I never liked he,

1467
01:24:09.190 --> 01:24:12.920
I'm really hot tub sauna like it.
I like it hot.

1468
01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:18.250
You like Vegas in the summer?
No,
that's too hot.
That's crazy.
That's silly planet,

1469
01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:21.620
Huh?
I like 90 degrees.
I like going outside when it's 90 degrees,

1470
01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:24.650
especially east coast 90 degrees because it's funky and sweaty.

1471
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:26.860
I think it's healthy.
It's good for you.

1472
01:24:26.861 --> 01:24:30.040
I think she agrees with what a Thong on a couple boys,

1473
01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:34.440
his down on my clogs getting tea and dirty,

1474
01:24:35.690 --> 01:24:40.550
dirty toenails got big Afro wig paper all over my chest.

1475
01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:46.280
That's an image you'll never forget.
I started the show it that.

1476
01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:47.310
It's not just not the,

1477
01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:48.350
<v 6>well,
I've never forget it.</v>

1478
01:24:48.351 --> 01:24:51.830
It's just what we could all relate what everyone could have seen themselves in

1479
01:24:51.831 --> 01:24:56.600
that sense,
especially if you do need to get an expected to get woken up.
Oh Jeez,

1480
01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:59.240
where are we going?
Where are we going?
That's a good album cover.

1481
01:24:59.241 --> 01:25:04.010
If you ever happened,
yo wouldn't be hilarious if it was the actual photo.

1482
01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:06.470
If you realized it and he said,
oh my God,
here,
hold my camera,

1483
01:25:06.710 --> 01:25:07.543
take a picture of this.

1484
01:25:07.770 --> 01:25:11.910
<v 3>I just remember him pointing at it.
What's that tape roll over?</v>

1485
01:25:11.911 --> 01:25:14.430
Up to my neck is a little areas,

1486
01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:18.020
loads shift of

1487
01:25:18.030 --> 01:25:22.380
<v 6>our time on this earth is spent devising new ways to get rid of loads.</v>

1488
01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:27.480
I would say 35 35 to 40% I mean think about some of the relationships that you

1489
01:25:28.651 --> 01:25:33.330
have.
We're really just exchanges from a load extract and contractor.

1490
01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:36.210
Yup.
You know it's like there's,
there's relationships at guys have,

1491
01:25:36.211 --> 01:25:40.290
especially like young men early on in life when you're essentially,
you know,

1492
01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:40.920
you don't,

1493
01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:45.420
you're like a vampire that must feed and you only have so long we can go before

1494
01:25:45.421 --> 01:25:46.790
you start going crazy.
Started,

1495
01:25:46.791 --> 01:25:49.920
started dating somebody like I'm pretty close to feeding.
Here we go.

1496
01:25:49.921 --> 01:25:52.470
And then once you get close enough so you can actually have sex by the time you

1497
01:25:52.471 --> 01:25:56.940
do that.
Most of us have already compromised our position considerably.

1498
01:25:57.150 --> 01:26:02.150
And the relationship that we've agreed to and relented to is completely not,

1499
01:26:03.170 --> 01:26:04.070
we're looking for,

1500
01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:07.150
<v 5>you know,
we just,
we just had to get some sex in,
you know,</v>

1501
01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:08.810
is it's impossible to avoid.

1502
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:11.750
So we tried to pretend to be the guy that you wanted us to be because that's the

1503
01:26:11.751 --> 01:26:12.584
way you get late.

1504
01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:16.970
It's becomes a junkie situation and becomes a situation where you're making

1505
01:26:16.971 --> 01:26:18.050
irrational decisions.

1506
01:26:18.051 --> 01:26:21.680
You're hoping that it works out and the person you wind up fucking is someone

1507
01:26:21.681 --> 01:26:25.820
you actually like and you'd just compatible personalities get together and you

1508
01:26:25.821 --> 01:26:29.300
raise a family or whatever you're hoping that you get to that situation.

1509
01:26:29.570 --> 01:26:33.440
But most of the time you don't.
Most of the time you completely incompatible.

1510
01:26:33.730 --> 01:26:35.630
Kellum made someone and they're fucking,

1511
01:26:35.631 --> 01:26:40.480
they're all sorts of problems and complaining and whining and Bullshit and,
oh,

1512
01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:44.270
the funniest one in the Dub David.
Oh yeah,
very much.
Here's the funny guy,

1513
01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:49.190
his whole,
you know,
you gotta talk to him sometime about this because he did it.

1514
01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:52.040
I thought he took the ring off to girl while she was asleep,

1515
01:26:52.041 --> 01:26:54.200
but he just stole it from the dresser.

1516
01:26:54.620 --> 01:26:57.950
But in the middle of the night he unengaged himself by taking the ring back.

1517
01:26:58.010 --> 01:27:02.120
Oh my God.
And her waking up the next day and he,

1518
01:27:02.121 --> 01:27:05.060
but he got engaged in like two weeks.
What does this fucking movies,

1519
01:27:05.930 --> 01:27:10.430
some people they,
they want that,
you know,
cause it's a fun thing to think of,

1520
01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:14.800
to love junkie.
It's like the love of that feeling,
that instant magic.
Well yeah,

1521
01:27:14.810 --> 01:27:18.890
everybody wants that.
Everybody wants to knock one out of the park.

1522
01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:22.460
They want you meet someone and you know,
she's,

1523
01:27:22.461 --> 01:27:26.090
she's nice and she's friendly and she's interesting and Oh my God,

1524
01:27:26.091 --> 01:27:29.780
I just know it's the one dom I only know for four hours,
but I'm telling you,

1525
01:27:29.781 --> 01:27:31.280
I'm marrying this girl tomorrow morning.

1526
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:33.830
I already asked her to marry we fuck five times already.

1527
01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:35.470
We've known each other for four hours.
Like what?

1528
01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:38.360
There's people that throw themselves with abandoned.

1529
01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:41.810
It's because they want someone to believe in them.

1530
01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:45.080
They want someone to love them the same way.

1531
01:27:45.081 --> 01:27:46.940
They want to love someone.

1532
01:27:46.941 --> 01:27:50.900
They have this massive need to both love and be loved.

1533
01:27:50.930 --> 01:27:54.200
They are there in a love deficit.
So when love comes along,

1534
01:27:54.201 --> 01:27:58.560
they fucking throw a shit fit.
They go crazy.
They abandoned their friends,

1535
01:27:58.561 --> 01:28:01.190
they stopped answering her cell phone.
They'll throw their phone in the toilet.

1536
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:03.500
I don't care.
I'm just by your side.
As long as I'm with you,

1537
01:28:03.770 --> 01:28:05.750
I don't want anything else.
We are complete.

1538
01:28:05.751 --> 01:28:10.180
You make me complete maybe complete time era.
They just ready and it was soaking.

1539
01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:13.640
I only dated once before she moved in.
Shazamm son.
That's what I'm talking.

1540
01:28:13.641 --> 01:28:16.760
That's how dom do.
No,
but I mean the thing is the list of nine years.

1541
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:20.330
But that was a very rare situation when she moved to China.

1542
01:28:20.810 --> 01:28:24.140
And the only way I was going to get her to come back was prior to move.
In.

1543
01:28:24.710 --> 01:28:28.340
How many comics do you know that have healthy relationships?

1544
01:28:29.220 --> 01:28:32.060
Uh,
that's a good question.

1545
01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:37.920
I'd have done seven.
Seven.
Seven is,
uh,
it's,
I think it's a,

1546
01:28:38.230 --> 01:28:40.310
especially art.
Yeah,

1547
01:28:41.250 --> 01:28:44.910
I think it's especially hard in any sort of a,

1548
01:28:44.911 --> 01:28:49.850
a creative sort of a,
a job.

1549
01:28:50.030 --> 01:28:53.120
You have to have a cool chick understands that.

1550
01:28:53.121 --> 01:28:57.080
Do you have to have someone who lets you think you have to have someone who

1551
01:28:57.110 --> 01:29:01.270
gives you a space,
you know it's not all up in your grill constantly.
Yeah.

1552
01:29:01.290 --> 01:29:02.123
Which also have someone,

1553
01:29:02.150 --> 01:29:05.670
<v 6>when you talk to they'll like they're,
they're fun to be around.
Your brain works.</v>

1554
01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:09.660
Yeah.
Their brain works and they,
the,
they have a positive spin on things.

1555
01:29:09.661 --> 01:29:10.830
Like there's certain people,

1556
01:29:10.831 --> 01:29:14.150
we all know this like when you meet them and then you,

1557
01:29:14.151 --> 01:29:19.110
you see them and you smile and then you become enhanced.
You know what I mean?

1558
01:29:19.111 --> 01:29:21.540
Like Joey Diaz,
perfect example.
What's up baby?
What are we doing here?

1559
01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:24.840
And you see him and we would all start smiling and we feel enhance.

1560
01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:27.780
And there's other people that come around and they drag on you.
You know,

1561
01:29:27.781 --> 01:29:30.570
there's other people that come around and they just start complaining and

1562
01:29:30.571 --> 01:29:34.510
whining and bitching.
And I've had both men,
I've had both.
And it's,

1563
01:29:34.540 --> 01:29:37.620
there's the life of a you,
if you're with someone that complains all the time,

1564
01:29:37.621 --> 01:29:39.450
that some of the takes that negative point of view all the time.

1565
01:29:39.630 --> 01:29:42.090
Your life will be hell.
It's gut wrenching.

1566
01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:45.250
<v 3>A friend of mine said there's two people in love.
There's fountains and drains.</v>

1567
01:29:45.530 --> 01:29:49.150
Aww,
that's beautiful.
And that's true.
But like when those drains,
they just,

1568
01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:52.660
you know,
it's like,
how you doing?
I'm hanging in there.

1569
01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:54.800
<v 6>No,
it was a brutal,
brutal.</v>

1570
01:29:54.830 --> 01:29:57.680
There's a comic that I know I love him to death and I won't say his name,
but I,

1571
01:29:57.690 --> 01:30:00.800
I spoke to him once and I said,
I'm never talking to some mother fucker again.

1572
01:30:01.250 --> 01:30:05.700
I go half session of them.
I can't,
it's too,
he's too obvious.
Oh really?
No.

1573
01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:09.620
Making that up too.
I was throwing people off the track now.
He was parked cat.

1574
01:30:10.190 --> 01:30:14.000
I grew up in Afghanistan.
Um,
but you know,
I w I would say,
hey,

1575
01:30:14.001 --> 01:30:17.210
what's going on with,
well not so good.
I'll tell you the whole situation.

1576
01:30:17.570 --> 01:30:21.910
The wife,
she walked out.
Okay.
You know,
she walked out on you miss [inaudible].

1577
01:30:22.110 --> 01:30:23.890
I thought,
I thought this was the,

1578
01:30:23.900 --> 01:30:27.650
so something that we'd both agree to and apparently she had to agree to that and

1579
01:30:27.651 --> 01:30:30.380
like,
oh Geez,
you mother fucker,
listen to yourself.
So you,

1580
01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:32.860
I haven't seen you in years and you just hit me with a,

1581
01:30:32.861 --> 01:30:35.830
a just a bucket of diarrhea.
You know what kind of,
you know,

1582
01:30:35.850 --> 01:30:40.130
just that there's people that don't even think at all about the person they're

1583
01:30:40.131 --> 01:30:44.130
talking to.
All they think about is like the shit that they want to,
they want to,

1584
01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:48.140
they want to burden you because their life has taken some terrible turn for the

1585
01:30:48.141 --> 01:30:52.010
worst.
Mostly a lot with a lot of people because there's shit personality,

1586
01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:56.180
you know,
that people just go fucking get away from me.
Oh,
they just run.

1587
01:30:56.420 --> 01:31:00.530
And then that same shitty personality is what you makes you get trapped by this

1588
01:31:00.531 --> 01:31:04.670
guy at a fucking party.
Do you know Jeremy Huts?
Uh,
the comedian from Canada?

1589
01:31:04.671 --> 01:31:08.630
I do not know him.
Okay.
He's fucking hilarious.
Yes.
Very good comedian.

1590
01:31:08.631 --> 01:31:11.360
Very hilarious.
I've only seen him in a video.

1591
01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:15.580
<v 3>He was serious.
We were doing Russell Peters a special and mature is,</v>

1592
01:31:15.850 --> 01:31:20.560
and he was my roommate and he'd come in,
hi.
Hi.
Hey Jeremy.
Hey Dude,

1593
01:31:22.810 --> 01:31:26.740
you don't have any tums?
Do I got like a bad stomach?
I said,
no,

1594
01:31:26.741 --> 01:31:31.030
I don't carry toms.
He goes,
you got any beer?
I go,
look,
fuck goes from tums,

1595
01:31:31.031 --> 01:31:33.730
the beer,
cheese.
You know what I mean?
But it,
but he was always like a,

1596
01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:38.500
and he's so fucking good on stage,
but he was such a,
I mean,
I still enjoy him,

1597
01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:43.480
but he is such a bummer,
you know he's been well in that sense.
You know,

1598
01:31:43.481 --> 01:31:46.600
like he's talking about his sinuses.
One night at the laugh factory,

1599
01:31:46.750 --> 01:31:48.730
there's a bunch of committee I said in Chariton Lynn Tase him.

1600
01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:53.410
No Co Group of Comedians is going to be concerned about your sinus no matter

1601
01:31:53.411 --> 01:31:57.340
what,
unless you have your sinuses removed.
It's not an interesting story.

1602
01:31:57.410 --> 01:31:59.770
We don't want to hear about your fucking postnasal drip.

1603
01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:00.491
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1604
01:32:00.491 --> 01:32:03.760
I'm not in to be around people that complain about stupid shit that you just man

1605
01:32:03.761 --> 01:32:07.000
up and deal with it.
Yeah.
He's saying knows bugs.
Yeah.
Just deal with it.

1606
01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:10.630
Right pitch right.
God dammit.

1607
01:32:10.750 --> 01:32:12.580
I went through most of my life with a broken nose.

1608
01:32:13.070 --> 01:32:14.230
I broke my nose when I was five,

1609
01:32:14.231 --> 01:32:18.070
fell down a flight of stairs and for most of my life I had like shitty breathing

1610
01:32:18.071 --> 01:32:21.790
out of my nose was all fucked up.
Yeah,
it was a mess.
It was all,

1611
01:32:21.791 --> 01:32:26.740
and then from getting punched in the face from wrestling and kickboxing and

1612
01:32:26.741 --> 01:32:28.960
taekwondo,
just always getting hit in the fucking face.

1613
01:32:28.961 --> 01:32:31.750
I'm don't know how many times I got hit in the face,
so the inside of the nose,

1614
01:32:31.751 --> 01:32:35.950
it was just a mass that I had like one little baby channel.
They opened it up,

1615
01:32:35.970 --> 01:32:37.090
they cleaned it all out.

1616
01:32:37.090 --> 01:32:39.720
It was one of the best things I ever amazing that you didn't even know where you

1617
01:32:39.721 --> 01:32:40.240
were.
Listen,

1618
01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:45.240
my mom's mouth breathing those mouth breathing for a giant chunk of my life and

1619
01:32:45.371 --> 01:32:46.770
I was trying to do like hardcore athletic.

1620
01:32:46.771 --> 01:32:50.260
So I was trying to do martial arts and with a broken nose I useless.
Knows

1621
01:32:52.750 --> 01:32:57.220
that was my notes,
literally.
But now it's like,
ah,

1622
01:32:57.250 --> 01:33:00.370
now I can breathe out of the operation.
Couple of years ago,
a few years ago,

1623
01:33:00.371 --> 01:33:02.550
I made a,
it was,
it was so important to me that I made a little video,

1624
01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:06.040
knew you when you were all died.
We'd probably got worse.

1625
01:33:06.041 --> 01:33:09.780
It got worse as time went on it.
And then I broke it again in,
um,

1626
01:33:10.270 --> 01:33:14.620
in like 2007 I broke,
I broke up pretty bad.
Those,
it was pretty bloody.

1627
01:33:14.621 --> 01:33:18.370
And I got black eyes and shit from,
from a,
Ha we,
I headbutted,

1628
01:33:18.371 --> 01:33:22.420
we collided Jujitsu class.
Jujitsu is,
you know,

1629
01:33:22.450 --> 01:33:25.600
the two things that happened to hurt Ya.
One accidental collisions.

1630
01:33:25.601 --> 01:33:28.490
Like sometimes you'll be throwing up a need for a triangle and you hit someone

1631
01:33:28.510 --> 01:33:32.050
the eye and it fucks are eye up.
It's happened to me.
I've done it accidentally.

1632
01:33:32.051 --> 01:33:34.540
It's just a,
it's just one of the things that happens.

1633
01:33:34.820 --> 01:33:38.830
Another thing that happens is sometimes people that are rolling right next to

1634
01:33:38.831 --> 01:33:42.430
you collide in you and you bonk heads and shit.
That's fucked up.

1635
01:33:42.431 --> 01:33:45.190
I've had that happen.
When you get hit pretty fucking hard.

1636
01:33:45.730 --> 01:33:49.240
I got suckered in a bar.
I was,
I was a doorman,
the bar,
uh,

1637
01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:51.970
me and Randall Cobb would have doormen really?
And Joe,

1638
01:33:52.030 --> 01:33:54.990
I don't fucking know anything.
They went,
what year was this?
I Dunno.

1639
01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:59.780
78 aware in Philly at a place called Doc Watson.

1640
01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:01.590
But it was mostly when Randall Tex cap.

1641
01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:05.960
Do you have a picture of you two together?
But he,
you know,
he was,

1642
01:34:05.970 --> 01:34:09.490
he was the North American,
a heavyweight karate champion at the time.
Yeah.

1643
01:34:09.491 --> 01:34:11.760
That's what a lot of people don't know.
He was a of kickbox.
Oh,

1644
01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:14.570
he could kick over your head,
man.
He was,
he had,
and each,

1645
01:34:14.590 --> 01:34:17.480
the first thing he showed me was his nose.
He had no cartilage in it knows,

1646
01:34:18.530 --> 01:34:20.350
it's magical.
But anyway,

1647
01:34:20.351 --> 01:34:23.620
I got suckered by this guy and broke my nose.

1648
01:34:23.621 --> 01:34:25.810
And the worst thing was it wasn't the pain.

1649
01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:29.980
It was the sound of them putting it back in place.
You know,

1650
01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:34.840
like with the local appliers they take,
well,
when,
when I got my,

1651
01:34:34.841 --> 01:34:36.760
um,
my nose fixed,

1652
01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:40.150
the boogers that came out were so horrendous that I saved them and I took

1653
01:34:40.151 --> 01:34:44.440
pictures of him.
You want to look at it?
Would you look at
asteroids?

1654
01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:46.330
I'm just going to show it to you because you're not even gonna believe it.

1655
01:34:46.331 --> 01:34:50.910
What is this?
This is when he had the check.
This is right after this is a,

1656
01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:56.100
I would have to blow snot out and I would use a waterpik and throw it through my

1657
01:34:56.141 --> 01:34:57.560
nose to clean my nose out.

1658
01:34:58.010 --> 01:34:59.390
<v 1>It's pretty deep.
It's pretty intense.</v>

1659
01:35:08.030 --> 01:35:10.510
<v 11>Oh,
special</v>

1660
01:35:10.890 --> 01:35:13.690
<v 1>nostrils attachment.
Oh Jesus.
Is that,</v>

1661
01:35:13.691 --> 01:35:16.060
it's like a lead salute the way you ain't seen shit sign.

1662
01:35:16.061 --> 01:35:17.620
Wait til you see these boogers.
No,
I'm gonna pull out.

1663
01:35:20.110 --> 01:35:23.260
If you email him the m I could show like the audience.
Okay.

1664
01:35:23.261 --> 01:35:26.200
Let me find the really good ones cause they're so ridiculous.

1665
01:35:27.550 --> 01:35:32.020
But you know,
my,
what was happening was that my body was,
um,
you know,

1666
01:35:32.021 --> 01:35:36.900
making these slots you're throwing up some me knows.
Yeah.

1667
01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:40.870
I kind of find them.
I don't know where they are though.
Unfortunately.

1668
01:35:40.871 --> 01:35:44.000
They probably deepen this I photo well,

1669
01:35:44.010 --> 01:35:46.240
that would give us a good excuse to get together and new to,

1670
01:35:46.810 --> 01:35:49.990
here's a picture of it.
Here's a still photo.
One of my boogers.
Yeah.
Hold on,

1671
01:35:49.991 --> 01:35:52.570
let me,
there was so ridiculous.
I think I put them on Twitter.

1672
01:35:53.050 --> 01:35:54.450
Did I put them on Twitter and on?

1673
01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:57.910
But I think the beginning of this video right here,

1674
01:35:57.970 --> 01:36:01.940
I definitely put them in the middle.
Oh yeah.

1675
01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:06.520
That's actually the clot.
The doctor pulled out my notes just so shit I showed,

1676
01:36:06.521 --> 01:36:11.521
I showed Tomi Segora yet at the airport and he almost threw up.

1677
01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:16.810
I got,
I'm real close to throw it up.
He had to turn away.
He had a hold his mouth.

1678
01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:20.410
It was pretty bad ass.
I think I'm closing it out of here.
Dumb.

1679
01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:23.530
I think that was the first time I met Tom Segura is that weekend right after he

1680
01:36:23.531 --> 01:36:28.270
had that operation,
this certain shit that,
you know,
if you can get it fixed,
man,

1681
01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:32.390
if you have a deviated septum and you get it affects your life will change you,

1682
01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:35.470
you will have a,
uh,
uh,
an easier life.

1683
01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:39.340
Like it's hard when you only can breed that of your fucking mouth.
That sucks.

1684
01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:43.690
But you can get some sleep apnea.
Beautiful.
I just found it.
Is it 100% though?

1685
01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:45.790
I mean,
could you go back right now and having sex?
It

1686
01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:53.790
look at the size of that God damn a date.
It's like a jewel.
Email it to me.

1687
01:36:54.030 --> 01:36:56.970
Email it to you right now.
That's disturbing.

1688
01:36:57.110 --> 01:36:59.760
How does so do you think you could go back and they could actually fix it up

1689
01:36:59.790 --> 01:37:03.930
even more?
I mean,
no,
no,
it's clean now.
It's awesome now.
Yeah.
No,

1690
01:37:03.931 --> 01:37:08.010
it's 100% but it's,
it looks as different colors in it.
Yeah.
It's crazy.

1691
01:37:08.110 --> 01:37:11.580
It shouldn't even be real beautiful about it.
Yeah,
it's disgusting.

1692
01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:14.393
<v 4>Hot.</v>

1693
01:37:14.890 --> 01:37:18.130
<v 1>You can reduce the message.
I don't want to reduce it.
Actual size,</v>

1694
01:37:18.430 --> 01:37:21.760
actual size white,
trying to save gigabytes.

1695
01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:27.130
Rising sent,
sent the photo of the booger and not even the best photo of it.
It's,

1696
01:37:27.131 --> 01:37:30.520
it's,
it's so ridiculous.
It doesn't even look real.

1697
01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:34.030
It doesn't look like it could come out of your nose and it came out in one giant

1698
01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:39.310
super satisfying.
Honk
is another photo of it.

1699
01:37:39.311 --> 01:37:43.490
That's a closeup.
Jesus Shit.

1700
01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:46.510
Yeah.
It's like crystal that came out of my nose.

1701
01:37:48.490 --> 01:37:52.150
But I tell you what,
man,
for me,
that shit was sweet relief for me.

1702
01:37:52.151 --> 01:37:54.310
I know you're looking at and go,
Joe and I want to see your snack.

1703
01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:56.030
Then why you're looking,
bitch,
we told you what we're going

1704
01:37:56.030 --> 01:37:59.700
<v 5>to do.
Listen,
I'm feeling bad that I'm showing these people this and that.</v>

1705
01:37:59.701 --> 01:38:03.090
They're going to get sick.
Brian.
Let's kill it.
Kill it.
I think we made our point.

1706
01:38:04.390 --> 01:38:08.480
It was,
but for me,
man,
that that represents freedom.
That's my shackle.

1707
01:38:08.510 --> 01:38:12.400
Quite the host.
I feel fantastic.
I breathe out in my nose.

1708
01:38:13.470 --> 01:38:17.940
You look good as well.
Thanks Joe.
I feel good doing a lot of stretching now.

1709
01:38:18.090 --> 01:38:20.310
Are you a updating your Twitter?
You've been getting on Twitter?

1710
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.010
Let me say it was the last time he got on this water.

1711
01:38:23.011 --> 01:38:27.870
what's my Twitter?

Rarer.
That's it.

It says at del Mar area,
everything's at,

1713
01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:34.680

1714
01:38:34.690 --> 01:38:39.690

1715
01:38:39.901 --> 01:38:44.060
person is going to the movies right now.
People tried that for awhile.
Right?

1716
01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:48.030
Remember it got too pretentious stuff.
Do you tweet a lot?
Yeah.

1717
01:38:48.060 --> 01:38:50.910
Tweet all the time.
You know what's the best thing that I get into a habit of it?

1718
01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:55.100
It's,

it's fun really.
It's really fun.

1723
01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:15.480
I worked the club and they misspelled there as well.
I don't even know.

1724
01:39:15.481 --> 01:39:19.850
That's how career he spelled it at the club.
You worked at some mother fuckers,

1725
01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:24.720

Captain Brian's off the hook.
Christ.
Where's that place?
Marco island.

1726
01:39:24.721 --> 01:39:28.620
It's dead to me.
It's a great place actually.

1727
01:39:29.370 --> 01:39:32.910
Marco island.
Oh fuck.
Beautiful.
Florida is fucking crazy,
isn't it?
Yeah.

1728
01:39:32.980 --> 01:39:35.750
Florida's crazy.
On a totally different level.
That's not the,

1729
01:39:35.751 --> 01:39:39.270
the rest of the country.
Florida is love it and I loved that Improv in Hollywood.

1730
01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:43.740
Hollywood,
Florida.
Oh that's a great place.
The Indian casino.
Hard rock.

1731
01:39:43.741 --> 01:39:45.120
Cause I did tell him to Joe,
mom,

1732
01:39:45.420 --> 01:39:48.390
make sure you don't say anything about the seminars,
anything bad.
They go like,

1733
01:39:48.391 --> 01:39:51.900
I got 15 minutes on the Seminole Indians.
They actually said that to you.
Wow.

1734
01:39:51.930 --> 01:39:54.830
Of course I went up and said nothing but good things about them.
You know,

1735
01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:57.080
just cause like somebody is going to tell me what to say.
I go,

1736
01:39:57.360 --> 01:40:01.630
I got to say something of all the tribes just seminar on my favorite.
I'm not,

1737
01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:05.090
I'm not a big fan of the Apache and Arapahoe and go fuck them.

1738
01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:09.630
I love the seminar paper.
So what could they say?
The Seminoles,
a sponsor,

1739
01:40:09.631 --> 01:40:12.570
a bunch of a professional pool matches.
Oh,
do they?
Yeah,

1740
01:40:12.571 --> 01:40:16.740
they still have a whole tour.
The Seminole Indians,
uh,
used to,
uh,

1741
01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:19.190
Seminole tribe brother used to be,
I don't know if you're allowed to call.

1742
01:40:19.340 --> 01:40:21.810
He's supposed to call them Indians come.
Why would you call them Indian?

1743
01:40:21.811 --> 01:40:24.200
Native American.
Yeah,
it's natives,
you know,
because like,

1744
01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:28.410
or colors the idea that we called them Indians like deep into the 20th century.

1745
01:40:28.411 --> 01:40:32.120
It's really pretty fucking crazy.
Indian come from Columbus.
Oh,

1746
01:40:32.130 --> 01:40:36.270
he thought he was going into you.
Right.
She's fucking assholes.
Get in the ocean.

1747
01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:40.740
We're in India.
He saw these little brown people.

1748
01:40:40.741 --> 01:40:43.650
These are Indians like they have no idea they were in The Bahamas.

1749
01:40:44.290 --> 01:40:45.870
The whole thing is preposterous.

1750
01:40:46.410 --> 01:40:48.090
It's really funny when you stop and think about that.

1751
01:40:48.091 --> 01:40:52.110
They still celebrate Columbus Day.
First of all,
Columbia's never even came here.

1752
01:40:52.130 --> 01:40:53.730
Well I should have Italian.

1753
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:57.480
<v 6>Have you ever read some of the shit that Columbus did?
Leave ferns.</v>

1754
01:40:57.740 --> 01:41:00.940
It was Leif Erikson was waves the viking.
No,
but he was the first one here.

1755
01:41:00.970 --> 01:41:03.730
Wasn't here.
Well now not even work.
The red.
No,

1756
01:41:03.731 --> 01:41:07.450
they've actually found the really crazy thing is the oldest bod did they found

1757
01:41:07.451 --> 01:41:09.580
in North America and west Chinese.

1758
01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:12.940
So I love a bitch that Chinese are everywhere.

1759
01:41:13.150 --> 01:41:15.710
Well there they don't know like they're trying,

1760
01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:19.540
they're still trying to figure out like when people got in ships and traveled

1761
01:41:19.541 --> 01:41:21.100
all over the world.
By the way,
uh,

1762
01:41:21.101 --> 01:41:23.530
we are going to do a podcast with John Anthony West.

1763
01:41:23.531 --> 01:41:25.810
Speaking of this cause this is a fucking fascinating topic.

1764
01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:28.620
I've been exchanging email,
I owe him an email but he wants to do,

1765
01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:29.890
we're probably going to have to do it on Skype.

1766
01:41:29.891 --> 01:41:31.810
It may be the first time we ever do one on Skype,

1767
01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:34.150
but it's worth doing it for this Guy John Anthony West,

1768
01:41:34.151 --> 01:41:37.750
if you don't know is the guy who's like the main egyptologist who's out there

1769
01:41:37.751 --> 01:41:42.490
trying to predate the Egyptian empire and he says that it's like there's many

1770
01:41:42.491 --> 01:41:43.000
empires.

1771
01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:46.570
It's not just like one and is it goes back thousands and thousands of years

1772
01:41:46.571 --> 01:41:48.880
earlier.
And he has a geologists on his side.

1773
01:41:48.881 --> 01:41:50.470
It's really interesting because he's a,

1774
01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:53.950
all these different academics are fighting it tooth and nail because it makes

1775
01:41:53.951 --> 01:41:58.330
everything had been teaching everybody in school cause it's off by thousands of

1776
01:41:58.330 --> 01:42:01.360
years.
They,
they've dated the enclosure of the spanx.

1777
01:42:01.630 --> 01:42:05.950
There's these huge like Fisher marks that are in the walls with this,
of this,

1778
01:42:05.951 --> 01:42:09.430
the,
this uh,
the,
the stones and what they come from,

1779
01:42:09.431 --> 01:42:12.400
every geologist agrees on us is thousands of years of rainfall.

1780
01:42:12.410 --> 01:42:17.350
And these are clearly like the way water erodes that aliens built the pyramids.

1781
01:42:17.470 --> 01:42:18.730
No,
no.
I think,

1782
01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:23.760
I think the Egyptian civilization was most likely as advanced if not more

1783
01:42:24.941 --> 01:42:28.270
advanced than we are today,
but in a different direction.

1784
01:42:28.540 --> 01:42:32.830
They became advanced with a language like hieroglyphics with incredible

1785
01:42:32.831 --> 01:42:35.770
mathematics that we're allowing them to make these geometric structures.

1786
01:42:35.770 --> 01:42:38.170
I mean however the fuck they figured out how to do it.

1787
01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:39.730
There's a lot of speculation,

1788
01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:44.590
but to pretend that the great pyramid of Giza is not an astronomically

1789
01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:49.870
incredibly amazing fucking accomplishment is crate.
It's ridiculous.

1790
01:42:50.020 --> 01:42:53.590
It's one of the greatest accomplishments of human engineering of all time and no

1791
01:42:53.591 --> 01:42:54.820
one even knows when it was Maine.

1792
01:42:54.910 --> 01:42:59.910
The gas is 2,500 BC and it's based on like carbon samples and shit they found at

1793
01:43:00.581 --> 01:43:03.910
the area,
but it's still,
they're not completely sure about that.

1794
01:43:03.911 --> 01:43:07.970
There's a lot of weird speculation and the Sphinx,
the Sphinx with all the,
the,

1795
01:43:07.971 --> 01:43:10.570
the deep water erosion around the enclosure.

1796
01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:12.670
What they're saying is that that was that.

1797
01:43:12.671 --> 01:43:16.080
If that was thousands of years of rainfall than the last time there was heavy

1798
01:43:16.081 --> 01:43:19.990
rain fall on the Nile valley was something crazy like 9,000 BC.

1799
01:43:20.650 --> 01:43:23.410
So instead of being 2,500 BC like they thought it was,

1800
01:43:23.411 --> 01:43:25.930
it was like thousands of you older still.

1801
01:43:26.130 --> 01:43:29.920
And we are to them training again.
Crazy it would they,
well,

1802
01:43:29.921 --> 01:43:31.030
they used to be a jungle.

1803
01:43:31.150 --> 01:43:34.300
It used to be a rain forest Nial valleys to be like a rain forest.

1804
01:43:34.301 --> 01:43:37.210
It was raining constantly and then slowly it became a desert.

1805
01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:41.290
And the last time there was like heavy rainfall.
It's like 9,000 PC.

1806
01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:44.350
It's fucking nuts.
And this area,

1807
01:43:44.351 --> 01:43:49.351
this cutout area shows thousands of years of rainfall and the Egyptologist don't

1808
01:43:49.511 --> 01:43:50.111
want to address it.

1809
01:43:50.111 --> 01:43:53.360
They look at it and it's freaking them out because it's pretty obvious and

1810
01:43:53.361 --> 01:43:55.950
there's no getting around it.
If it is rainfall,

1811
01:43:55.970 --> 01:43:57.620
the whole thing's got to be thrown out.

1812
01:43:57.860 --> 01:44:02.060
And this is the only physical thing they have to show that there was something

1813
01:44:02.061 --> 01:44:05.140
that existed that long ago.
And that's why they resist it.
Like the,

1814
01:44:05.141 --> 01:44:06.230
the scholars are like,
you know,

1815
01:44:06.231 --> 01:44:10.010
where's the evidence of this civilization that it wouldn't have existed 10,000

1816
01:44:10.011 --> 01:44:14.300
plus years ago?
There is no evidence.
And you know that what they're saying is,

1817
01:44:14.301 --> 01:44:16.700
which this guy's like this shy John Anthony West is saying it's,

1818
01:44:16.701 --> 01:44:20.150
there wouldn't really be much.
There's like this stuff.
There's like,
I mean,

1819
01:44:20.151 --> 01:44:24.610
10,000 years,
that's an insane amount of time.
10,000 BC.
Come on,

1820
01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:26.270
think about how long ago,

1821
01:44:26.271 --> 01:44:30.320
12,000 fucking years is think of how crazy that is.
Well,

1822
01:44:30.321 --> 01:44:34.610
Christ was only 2007.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well supposedly,

1823
01:44:34.630 --> 01:44:37.730
do you think crash Israel think pressures are real guy?
Yeah.
You think so?

1824
01:44:37.731 --> 01:44:38.564
For sure.

1825
01:44:38.870 --> 01:44:41.780
<v 3>Well,
I don't,
I mean,
I don't know why they would make it up.</v>

1826
01:44:41.810 --> 01:44:45.890
I'm not saying he's got,
or what about Santa Claus?
Santa Claus for sure.
100%.

1827
01:44:45.950 --> 01:44:48.740
100%.
Um,
and you know what's amazing about him,

1828
01:44:48.890 --> 01:44:51.380
no matter how many people are already takes care of everybody.
If you're good,

1829
01:44:51.710 --> 01:44:55.790
if you're good,
you leave a cookie yet,
you know,
you know,
it's funny about that.

1830
01:44:55.791 --> 01:44:59.120
We're talking about these phrases come down in history.

1831
01:44:59.570 --> 01:45:02.690
I was just staying at a hotel in Rochester and they,

1832
01:45:02.691 --> 01:45:05.590
for some reason they didn't register my name.
And,
uh,

1833
01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:07.970
so the friend of mine finally gets through what she goes,

1834
01:45:07.971 --> 01:45:10.640
what are you fucking King Tut?
And I'm thinking,

1835
01:45:10.670 --> 01:45:12.770
isn't that interesting that King Tut came down,

1836
01:45:12.771 --> 01:45:15.890
he took about Egypt like this kid who was,
who died.
Oh,

1837
01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:17.600
that caught with thousands of years ago.

1838
01:45:18.140 --> 01:45:22.370
He's still a reference for like a wise ass remark.
You know what I mean?
Yeah,

1839
01:45:22.890 --> 01:45:27.880
<v 6>yeah.
It is pretty ridiculous.
You'll kink fucked and thought in common.
You know,</v>

1840
01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:32.310
he had a lopsided head.
Yeah.
The crazy fucked up elongated head.

1841
01:45:32.970 --> 01:45:37.880
Who knows that.
But you will,
you ever seen images of what a fan of his attorney,

1842
01:45:38.430 --> 01:45:39.241
his family,

1843
01:45:39.241 --> 01:45:43.140
there was some weird physical characteristics who family that a lot of the crazy

1844
01:45:43.141 --> 01:45:45.700
conspiracy theorists guys really latch onto because it's like,

1845
01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:50.190
look at it said he's clearly an alien,
you know,
cause he had like kind of a,

1846
01:45:50.191 --> 01:45:54.480
a weird shaped head.
You No,
no.
Normal prose and has a head like that.

1847
01:45:54.481 --> 01:45:57.150
What a bad motherfucker he is though.
That we're talking about.
I'm still,

1848
01:45:57.210 --> 01:46:02.130
that's what I'm saying.
Yeah.
No.
How old was he when he died?
He was a kid,
right?

1849
01:46:02.131 --> 01:46:06.450
Kid.
Yeah.
And I think he was bartered.
Whether I wasn't a murder,
I don't know.

1850
01:46:06.451 --> 01:46:07.980
I went to do a bad neighborhood and Cairo,

1851
01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:11.850
they probably killed people all day back then.
Oh yeah.
You know,

1852
01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:16.320
the idea that John Anthony West is a promoting and set the idea of um,

1853
01:46:16.590 --> 01:46:20.910
a lot of these,
uh,
there's a lot of guys that are getting on this,
uh,

1854
01:46:21.100 --> 01:46:25.500
notions,
possibility of ancient civilizations that were wiped out by disasters.

1855
01:46:25.620 --> 01:46:28.050
Once we see shit like the tsunami and you know,

1856
01:46:28.090 --> 01:46:31.410
we see things like what Hurricane Katrina can do and we go,
well these,

1857
01:46:31.510 --> 01:46:34.350
these aren't even like the biggest storm to the biggest events in history.

1858
01:46:34.470 --> 01:46:39.120
What the fuck must have been like with something like this times 10 hit 10,000

1859
01:46:39.121 --> 01:46:42.270
years ago,
Mike wipe out most of us,
you know,

1860
01:46:42.570 --> 01:46:47.250
and they think that that has probably happened several times to people and that

1861
01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:50.340
civilization would reach a great height and then something would happen.

1862
01:46:50.341 --> 01:46:53.820
And by the way,
this coincides with two things.
One,
the end of the ice age,

1863
01:46:54.630 --> 01:46:56.250
which happened fairly abruptly,

1864
01:46:56.251 --> 01:47:00.450
which might've been caused by some sort of an event,
like an asteroid.

1865
01:47:00.660 --> 01:47:04.710
And evidence of asteroidal impacts somewhere around that long ago.

1866
01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:07.560
Tenting 10,500 plus years ago is the,
uh,

1867
01:47:07.561 --> 01:47:09.270
the estimation of when this asteroid hit.

1868
01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:13.110
Then you know that they're not completely exact on the date I think,

1869
01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:15.600
but they're all similar.
And so there's,
there's,

1870
01:47:16.170 --> 01:47:20.370
there's evidence also that we've been pelted in numerous times with asteroids.

1871
01:47:20.371 --> 01:47:22.470
Like once they started taking satellite photos,

1872
01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:25.650
I would think they would hit us all the time.
You,
all the randomness,
your space.

1873
01:47:25.980 --> 01:47:28.680
Well,
they get chewed up by our atmosphere for the most part,

1874
01:47:28.860 --> 01:47:31.320
but some of them don't.
Man,
the really big ones don't.

1875
01:47:31.410 --> 01:47:35.190
And there's been several extinction events in,

1876
01:47:35.191 --> 01:47:37.650
in the lifetime of the earth.
More than three,

1877
01:47:37.860 --> 01:47:40.860
and at least two of them that involve giant impacts.

1878
01:47:41.130 --> 01:47:46.130
Two of them are just big fucking volcano sized explosion asteroids a five miles

1879
01:47:47.761 --> 01:47:52.761
wide slamming into the earth and lava shoots up into the fucking sky and

1880
01:47:52.861 --> 01:47:57.861
blankets have Jesus just written a book.

1881
01:47:58.410 --> 01:48:02.670
But a lot of that stuff,
right.
Fucking imagine Fred Flinstone wrote books.

1882
01:48:03.420 --> 01:48:08.070
Okay.
Could you imagine what it must've been like live in back,
you know,

1883
01:48:08.690 --> 01:48:10.400
in the bedrock ears in the,
in the,

1884
01:48:10.401 --> 01:48:14.110
in the cave man years when there was like just grunt and shit.
Yeah.

1885
01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:19.200
No TV.
Just trying to follow around the herd of Buffalo that no,

1886
01:48:19.201 --> 01:48:21.690
you're trying to kill them so they always want to move by night.

1887
01:48:21.870 --> 01:48:23.340
So you've got to get up in the middle of the night.

1888
01:48:23.370 --> 01:48:26.370
The buffalo are moving and we've got to follow him.
Follow after him.

1889
01:48:26.371 --> 01:48:30.480
He baby gets killed by tigers.
Jaguars,
Jack,

1890
01:48:30.481 --> 01:48:34.350
your whole fucking family pulling women by the hair.
Do you think they did that?

1891
01:48:34.380 --> 01:48:35.820
They clubbed him over the head dragging.

1892
01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:39.390
Isn't it funny that that image of the cave men is like the predominant image

1893
01:48:39.750 --> 01:48:42.750
Cayman clubbing and check over the head dragging her by her hair.

1894
01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:46.110
That's the predominant image of what is a caveman doing.
First of all,

1895
01:48:46.111 --> 01:48:47.640
he's always got a club,
right?

1896
01:48:47.641 --> 01:48:50.760
Caitlyn's always had clubs and they always had a bear skin.

1897
01:48:50.910 --> 01:48:55.160
Some sort of like a Saturday night date,
where the fuck his salary,

1898
01:48:55.290 --> 01:48:58.920
why is it but who invented the club over the head and drag her by her hair?

1899
01:48:58.980 --> 01:49:03.900
You know,
I don't know.
Maybe it was King Tut,
but bits.
It's an amazing,

1900
01:49:04.110 --> 01:49:07.500
I mean,
is it,
I mean,
isn't it like that?
That's the,
uh,
that's the symbol.

1901
01:49:07.501 --> 01:49:10.020
We all say what fuck did that happen?

1902
01:49:10.110 --> 01:49:11.850
The club over the head and drag her by the hair.
That,

1903
01:49:11.851 --> 01:49:14.310
how many times have you heard that expression,
that expression,

1904
01:49:14.311 --> 01:49:17.520
when it comes to cavemen,
it's like super common.
Like what'd you came in?

1905
01:49:17.521 --> 01:49:19.020
He's gonna think every girl he meets,

1906
01:49:19.021 --> 01:49:20.610
you got clover over their head and dragged by her hair.

1907
01:49:21.820 --> 01:49:25.680
Did like looney tunes invent that.
Maybe I wonder,
I wonder who came up with it.

1908
01:49:25.681 --> 01:49:28.290
But it stuck culturally,
like all throughout my life.

1909
01:49:28.291 --> 01:49:33.270
I remember that the images of club in or girl or they head dragged her by her

1910
01:49:33.271 --> 01:49:33.500
hair.

1911
01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:36.960
I never knew that they weren't cavemen and dinosaurs together because we always

1912
01:49:36.961 --> 01:49:39.450
put them together.
Well,
if you hung out with Sarah Palin,

1913
01:49:39.451 --> 01:49:41.630
you would know that that's not factually correct because you,

1914
01:49:41.631 --> 01:49:42.600
it's a matter of fact,

1915
01:49:43.020 --> 01:49:46.590
there was a school teacher from Alaska that says that Sarah Pailin,
uh,

1916
01:49:46.710 --> 01:49:48.340
said that the earth is less than 10,000

1917
01:49:48.340 --> 01:49:51.490
<v 1>years old and that dinosaurs and men did live together.</v>

1918
01:49:51.491 --> 01:49:53.590
But mainstream science is trying to keep that from you.

1919
01:49:53.830 --> 01:49:55.560
And that there's a images,

1920
01:49:55.930 --> 01:50:00.370
there's images on the Internet of a dinosaurs with a human footprint side of it.

1921
01:50:03.450 --> 01:50:07.380
I wonder if it's true.
It could be just some hater bitch from Alaska,
you know,

1922
01:50:07.390 --> 01:50:10.150
who's the local library and maybe she's a cunt,
you know,
and,

1923
01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:13.090
and maybe Sarah Pailin blew her husband or something,
you know,

1924
01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:16.900
not that she would do that.
Would you do Sarah Palin?
Fuck yeah.

1925
01:50:16.990 --> 01:50:19.090
It depends on where I was,
where I was in my life,

1926
01:50:22.090 --> 01:50:26.680
where I was.
See he lays back getting may,
maybe it takes him two hours long.
Big.

1927
01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:31.420
It's crazy.
He legs glows,
shenanigans ensue.

1928
01:50:32.290 --> 01:50:36.400
I'm doing,
I'm Adam Carolla's podcast later.
If you can't get enough of me.

1929
01:50:36.850 --> 01:50:40.740
Did you turn it on that and you get that email that said who's coming here?
Uh,

1930
01:50:40.780 --> 01:50:45.580
went next Wednesday.
Yeah.
Bobcat Goldthwait fuck.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,

1931
01:50:45.581 --> 01:50:48.970
don't do that in front of him.
You fuck.
And he wants to forget those days.

1932
01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:51.990
And apparently he has an awesome movie.
Yeah,
I know about us moving.
Yeah.

1933
01:50:53.170 --> 01:50:56.530
Anthony has was talking all about it on Opie and Anthony.

1934
01:50:56.531 --> 01:50:59.860
The name is called God bless America.
You want to see a trailer?
I got a trailer,

1935
01:50:59.861 --> 01:51:03.240
but yeah,
I'd love to see a trailer.
I do want to say it.
Pull that shit up.
Yeah.

1936
01:51:03.410 --> 01:51:07.600
Bob Cats,
one of those guys that's so mild mannered before he goes on stage.

1937
01:51:07.780 --> 01:51:11.080
I think that was,
it goes crazy.
Yeah.
I never knew him as a comic.

1938
01:51:11.081 --> 01:51:15.670
So first time I ever met him,
he was a directing the Chappelle show.
And,
uh,
I was,

1939
01:51:15.671 --> 01:51:16.660
uh,
with Dave,

1940
01:51:16.661 --> 01:51:20.470
we were in New York City and Dave was just walking down the street with a fake

1941
01:51:20.471 --> 01:51:25.150
mustache on and,
uh,
he was giving out awards for the best New York boobs.

1942
01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:27.970
Oh,
really?
Yeah.
It was ridiculous.
And this was in the show?
Yeah,

1943
01:51:28.030 --> 01:51:30.550
that was the first time I ever met bobcat.
I,
I ran into him on the street.

1944
01:51:30.551 --> 01:51:33.700
I'm like,
what are you doing day?
He goes,
Hey Joe Rogan,
you want to help me out?

1945
01:51:34.030 --> 01:51:37.600
I go,
I only got like a half an hour.
Oh,
that's cool.
So it's for half an hour.

1946
01:51:37.601 --> 01:51:42.340
I carried his box of New York blue ribbons and he would go in and you got some

1947
01:51:42.341 --> 01:51:43.840
great New York boobs.

1948
01:51:44.140 --> 01:51:47.650
Give people like ribbons chip that's in bobcat was like directing the whole

1949
01:51:47.651 --> 01:51:50.500
thing.
So that's the first time I met him.
Very nice guy though.

1950
01:51:50.860 --> 01:51:54.070
I always liked him as a comic.
Here's the trailer,
which is our red band trailer,

1951
01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:56.410
B.
A.
N.
D.

1952
01:51:57.460 --> 01:52:01.010
<v 12>The most hilarious ringtone ever.
Just tanks pig.</v>

1953
01:52:04.380 --> 01:52:07.150
We have a press that just gives them a free pass.

1954
01:52:07.390 --> 01:52:10.030
The boys were caught after setting the homeless man on fire.

1955
01:52:20.460 --> 01:52:23.990
<v 13>A tumor.
This size is very dangerous.</v>

1956
01:52:24.980 --> 01:52:28.850
You have any family?
Can I take this?

1957
01:52:33.230 --> 01:52:34.100
<v 12>My name is Chloe.</v>

1958
01:52:34.101 --> 01:52:36.890
I live in Virginia Beach and everyone loves me because I'm so pretty.

1959
01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:38.400
I wanted an escalator.

1960
01:52:42.620 --> 01:52:46.350
He creepy isn't a school girl thing.
A little out moving.

1961
01:52:46.420 --> 01:52:47.960
Don't make a sound if you want the car.

1962
01:52:47.961 --> 01:52:50.090
Just taking my parents got me the wrong one anyways.
Yeah,

1963
01:52:50.150 --> 01:52:54.320
that's a fucking tragedy.
Did you just kill flowy?

1964
01:52:55.840 --> 01:52:56.673
<v 1>Awesome.</v>

1965
01:52:57.860 --> 01:53:01.590
<v 12>That was a fantastic start,
but no.
Who else really rips my cock off?</v>

1966
01:53:01.620 --> 01:53:05.260
If a Dashi animals,
we use rock stars.
Magic 10 who call their tits?

1967
01:53:05.261 --> 01:53:07.110
The girl who was Crystal's.

1968
01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:12.340
You're aiming at the bear,
right?
This is the best day ever.

1969
01:53:17.660 --> 01:53:18.720
Don't let me

1970
01:53:21.910 --> 01:53:26.560
recording this.
Thanks for turning off your cell phone.

1971
01:53:27.580 --> 01:53:28.413
You're welcome.

1972
01:53:29.830 --> 01:53:34.180
Why have a civilization if we no longer interested in being civilized

1973
01:53:36.930 --> 01:53:41.290
it buddy?
What's wrong?
A lot.
A lot of crazy people out there

1974
01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:47.920
who want to kill people who deserve to die.
We're going to do this or what?

1975
01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:53.050
I know it's not normal to want to kill,
but I am no longer normal.

1976
01:53:58.540 --> 01:54:02.770
Whoa.
We got to take both those spots.
Yeah.
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

1977
01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:04.753
Sounds like

1978
01:54:04.820 --> 01:54:08.700
<v 1>amazing.
Wow.
That's awesome.</v>

1979
01:54:10.660 --> 01:54:14.650
Wow.
That's a scary movie.
That's really cool.
Looks very pop fiction.

1980
01:54:14.651 --> 01:54:17.940
Eat kind of again,
like you know,
just bad ass.
You don't kill,
kill,

1981
01:54:17.941 --> 01:54:21.380
kill kind of movie.
It looks pretty sweet.
Yeah.
It's obviously got a,

1982
01:54:21.381 --> 01:54:25.080
an anti douchebag slant.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Which is always nice.

1983
01:54:25.170 --> 01:54:27.420
That's really cool because he,
he's a,
he's a great director.
He did.

1984
01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:31.350
When did he do windy city here?
Uh,
no.
Well,
I don't know if he did that,

1985
01:54:31.351 --> 01:54:35.520
but he did that clown movie,
which was great.

1986
01:54:35.521 --> 01:54:37.570
I saw that in the movie theater.
The city maybe.

1987
01:54:37.750 --> 01:54:40.660
<v 3>Yeah.
That was it.
Was that the one where they faked the guy?
Uh,</v>

1988
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:44.770
<v 1>dot.
Merera or Don Paris,
isn't it?
It's not embarrassing.
Jay,
Jimmy Kimmel.</v>

1989
01:54:45.110 --> 01:54:47.640
Jimmy Kimmel.
It was one of the producers.
That's really funny.
You know,

1990
01:54:47.641 --> 01:54:51.920
there's tons of people in that movie.
I've met that dude.
It's just,

1991
01:54:51.921 --> 01:54:54.940
it's too tragic.
Uh Huh.
Oh,
someone who's crazy,

1992
01:54:54.941 --> 01:54:57.170
who thinks they're actually famous.
Yeah.
We're actually having,

1993
01:54:57.171 --> 01:54:59.990
and you got an attitude that's a cracked me up about it.
That's hilarious.

1994
01:54:59.991 --> 01:55:03.480
He got an attitude once he made it.
Yeah.
Fake made it.
Yeah.

1995
01:55:04.100 --> 01:55:05.810
A few people that don't know what we're talking about.

1996
01:55:05.811 --> 01:55:08.870
Dom explained the whole situation because it's really pretty fascinating for

1997
01:55:08.871 --> 01:55:09.704
people.

1998
01:55:09.820 --> 01:55:11.150
<v 3>Best I remember is,
uh,</v>

1999
01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:15.330
they fabricated this guy becoming a celebrity,

2000
01:55:15.331 --> 01:55:19.740
gradually becoming a star.
And he had a movie and it was just,

2001
01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:24.360
the whole thing was a mock.
I went him and how else would I,

2002
01:55:24.980 --> 01:55:29.400
<v 1>he thinks it's real.
Like this guy named Perry.
Thanks crazy.
Thanks a,</v>

2003
01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:33.980
that he gets a star attitude.
Well,
the peewees,
it's a weird thing.

2004
01:55:33.981 --> 01:55:37.510
It's because people aren't paying attention to him and he isn't a movie.
Right?

2005
01:55:37.660 --> 01:55:39.060
It's like,
why?
What is that?
Yeah.

2006
01:55:39.061 --> 01:55:43.030
So that's why he's so crazy and it's so not,

2007
01:55:43.110 --> 01:55:44.070
he's tuned into

2008
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:46.290
<v 6>a dimension that's like right next door to ours.</v>

2009
01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:48.030
You ever met people that are like that?

2010
01:55:48.390 --> 01:55:51.270
They're not quite seeing things the way everybody else around us.
A scene.
Right.

2011
01:55:51.450 --> 01:55:54.450
You and you to wonder,
what does the world look like to them?
You know,

2012
01:55:54.630 --> 01:55:57.520
how many times have you met a comic?
Okay.
He,
perfect example.
Oh,

2013
01:55:57.521 --> 01:55:58.680
I know an open mic guys.

2014
01:55:58.681 --> 01:56:02.340
They'd come off stage and they fucking eight Dick and they hear phantom laughs.

2015
01:56:02.790 --> 01:56:05.160
They'll come off and go,
I'm going to think that one pretty good.
Yeah.

2016
01:56:05.190 --> 01:56:08.490
Pretty good set.
I killed.
Yeah.
I've asked people,
you know,

2017
01:56:08.491 --> 01:56:12.780
I've asked him while watching them just to silence having silent performances.

2018
01:56:14.070 --> 01:56:18.370
<v 2>Actually a bobcat.
Goldthwait a I definitely uh,
directed a windy city.
He,</v>

2019
01:56:18.410 --> 01:56:21.180
here's the Amazon.
Oh,
he directed that as well.

2020
01:56:22.410 --> 01:56:25.470
We're having this Friday because we're not having a ice house show Friday we're

2021

2023
01:56:30.211 --> 01:56:35.100
And then they're going to talk about their podcast,
which is the big three,

2024
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:38.100
a podcast network.
So we're going to have dawn in the studio,

What does that big three is?

2026
01:56:41.370 --> 01:56:45.280
Don Baer says podcast with,
with all the characters from this movie to Paris.

2027
01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:48.360
Scary Perry.
And you're going to bring that guy here,
hunt?
Yeah.

2028
01:56:48.540 --> 01:56:53.390
When is the Friday at 10 o'clock.
Wow.
You're going to deal with that guy.
Oh,

2029
01:56:53.391 --> 01:56:55.140
I'm,
I hang out with all those people all the time.

2030
01:56:55.170 --> 01:56:58.530
Did you want that Perry guy like here hanging out?
He's a normal,
he's fine.

2031
01:56:58.531 --> 01:57:00.050
He's just crazy.
But he's,
he's not,

2032
01:57:00.060 --> 01:57:02.790
he's not going to do anything bad or anything like that.
Plus,

2033
01:57:02.791 --> 01:57:06.840
I just upped the insurance and so it'd be a fine,
no,
it's not going to be that,

2034
01:57:06.841 --> 01:57:09.930
but it's going to be a descent into madness.
Oh,
that's what the,

2035
01:57:10.020 --> 01:57:11.730
if you haven't listened to a podcast,
it's,

2036
01:57:11.731 --> 01:57:15.780
it's the most amazing soap opera of a podcast.
It's great.
It's very addicting.

2037
01:57:15.781 --> 01:57:19.080
If you're looking for it to get started.
That's been there for a while.

2038
01:57:19.081 --> 01:57:21.780
That used to be on Adam Carolla's network,
uh,
and stuff like that.

2039
01:57:21.781 --> 01:57:24.840
And then now dawn has a whole studio in his house.

2040
01:57:24.870 --> 01:57:28.490
Pretty much has like a studio like this inside his house.
And uh,
it's great.

2041
01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:30.890
Neil leads,
you can't be beat that.

2042
01:57:31.110 --> 01:57:34.410
The mattress guy that owns that mattress store right here,

2043
01:57:34.760 --> 01:57:37.680
a couple of mattresses,
stores big a celebrity in La.

2044
01:57:37.681 --> 01:57:41.160
He's now one of the new sponsors and he's now every Ding Dong show.

2045
01:57:41.161 --> 01:57:44.220
He comes to the Ding Dong show and he's just crazy

2046
01:57:44.420 --> 01:57:48.770
<v 6>real.
It is insane.
That dude's nuts.
But it's Hilarious,
man.
It's,</v>

2047
01:57:48.950 --> 01:57:52.580
if you can say all these characters uncomfortable talking to crazy people,
you,

2048
01:57:52.590 --> 01:57:56.090
you don't,
well,
you can have that guy in the studio.
I would be freaking out.

2049
01:57:56.120 --> 01:57:58.260
I'd be like,
I can't,
this is not right.

2050
01:57:58.261 --> 01:58:00.680
You can't have a conversation while there's someone here that's not having the

2051
01:58:00.681 --> 01:58:01.514
same conversation.

2052
01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:05.240
Someone here is in another room looking at the whole thing through plexiglass.

2053
01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:07.270
<v 2>Right.
I can,
I can deal with those people in spurts.</v>

2054
01:58:07.271 --> 01:58:09.820
Like I'm not going to have the person over to my house or I'm not going to like

2055
01:58:09.821 --> 01:58:10.654
fucking start

2056
01:58:10.990 --> 01:58:11.481
<v 6>of those people.</v>

2057
01:58:11.481 --> 01:58:16.130
They almost have lego like a consciousness condom on did not feel and everything

2058
01:58:16.131 --> 01:58:18.110
that's happening,
it's not during that different reality.

2059
01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:21.710
Remember that Guy Joe at late at night on the college to Robert.

2060
01:58:21.711 --> 01:58:24.920
I'll do vial or just wrap it up.
I talked to him the other day.
He ran away.

2061
01:58:26.030 --> 01:58:28.700
He always liked me.
Me and him always used to get along.

2062
01:58:28.900 --> 01:58:30.530
He was a nice guy cause those are like,

2063
01:58:30.610 --> 01:58:33.380
like dawn Barris would always be mean to that dude.
And I'm like,

2064
01:58:33.381 --> 01:58:36.080
he's not a bad guy man.
He's just kind of crazy.
But he's,

2065
01:58:36.440 --> 01:58:39.590
he's a pleasant to be around,
you know?
Yeah.
He's a nice guy.

2066
01:58:39.630 --> 01:58:42.340
It's not being mean anybody.
He would walk from downtown.

2067
01:58:42.510 --> 01:58:46.700
<v 1>It was pasta does as a kite,
is he?
Yeah.
Yeah.
No,
not high,</v>

2068
01:58:46.710 --> 01:58:49.120
but I don't know.
I smoked weed with that dude.

2069
01:58:49.550 --> 01:58:50.840
<v 2>Have you ever seen his,
uh,</v>

2070
01:58:50.990 --> 01:58:54.480
have you ever seen his like his web show that he did with Mary?

2071
01:58:54.750 --> 01:58:58.700
I'm Mary Jane and Don produced it.
Uh,
like it's a show for him.

2072
01:58:58.701 --> 01:59:01.160
It's kind of like this,
but a podcast.
I'll show you a clip of it.

2073
01:59:01.161 --> 01:59:02.090
It will blow your mind.
Go.

2074
01:59:02.091 --> 01:59:05.060
Did they start like two years ago they did like Don Barris gone.

2075
01:59:05.110 --> 01:59:09.520
Barry's help the help film it and him and Don bears hitting each other.
I'll,

2076
01:59:09.550 --> 01:59:11.300
you know,
they all love each other done.

2077
01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:13.970
Don takes care of so many people there and you know,

2078
01:59:13.971 --> 01:59:17.630
he's Cure Robert William or via,
well he,
you know Mary Jane.
Wow.

2079
01:59:17.631 --> 01:59:18.290
That's great practice.

2080
01:59:18.290 --> 01:59:20.550
For the longest time I remember he was calling him Hitler and he would always

2081
01:59:20.551 --> 01:59:23.580
just see them and put his finger over his nose and say that they're Hitler.

2082
01:59:23.581 --> 01:59:25.950
We got to remember Don Paris has been,
they're so fucking long.

2083
01:59:25.970 --> 01:59:29.000
Tom Embarrassing there.
From how long would you say?
20 years maybe.

2084
01:59:29.090 --> 01:59:33.320
<v 1>At least always.
Got Along with don bears.
He's a fucking sweetheart of a guy.
I,</v>

2085
01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:37.730
I don't think in the 20 years that I've known that guy or how ever long it's

2086
01:59:37.731 --> 01:59:41.420
been,
not quite 20 years,
but however many years it's been an la,

2087
01:59:41.510 --> 01:59:44.440
never ever had an end even,
uh,

2088
01:59:44.480 --> 01:59:46.610
an unpleasant word with dawn Barris.

2089
01:59:46.940 --> 01:59:50.930
So sweetheart of a guy relationship story funny cause he,
Eddie Haskell's me.

2090
01:59:51.170 --> 01:59:53.600
Good evening,
Mr. Herrera.
How are you doing?
You look great tonight.

2091
01:59:53.810 --> 01:59:58.670
It's a beautiful color for you.
It's always like some sort of a uh,
uh,
an act,

2092
01:59:58.760 --> 02:00:02.020
you know,
Ho is like put on a certain voice,
fuck around with you.

2093
02:00:02.210 --> 02:00:06.860
Him and Brian Cowen have some elaborate rape theme they do every time they see

2094
02:00:06.861 --> 02:00:10.710
each other.
Where,
where,
uh,
dawn Barris winds up raping Brian Callan.

2095
02:00:12.440 --> 02:00:14.990
It starts out,
I get it always starts out the same way.

2096
02:00:14.990 --> 02:00:16.010
It always ends the same way.

2097
02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:19.860
There's something about the store where people do stupid shit like that and like

2098
02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:20.990
keep it going forever.

2099
02:00:21.230 --> 02:00:23.960
Remember the thing they used to have with Eleanor wants to ask her about it.

2100
02:00:23.990 --> 02:00:26.930
You got change for a dollar and she would go digging or a prenup start

2101
02:00:26.931 --> 02:00:29.540
masturbating and we,
we,
we do this.

2102
02:00:29.690 --> 02:00:34.400
This is stupid fucking thing we would do literally once a week for years.

2103
02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.490
I used to get rubbed together.
She's crazy.

2104
02:00:37.560 --> 02:00:39.800
That girl strong to remember when she was a pro wrestler.

2105
02:00:40.460 --> 02:00:43.760
I used to go see her easy rider rider,
right.
We,
we went to see her,

2106
02:00:43.761 --> 02:00:46.130
she was one of the waitresses and now she's a very funny comic.

2107
02:00:47.040 --> 02:00:50.420
Eleanor Kerrigan is her name and she's hilarious and we're so happy she's

2108
02:00:50.570 --> 02:00:53.810
finally doing standup because she was always like one of the funniest people

2109
02:00:53.960 --> 02:00:56.880
that would hang around at the store and she wasn't even a comic.

2110
02:00:56.880 --> 02:00:57.713
She was a waitress.

2111
02:00:57.780 --> 02:01:01.940
We had a thing called the punch to the twat where I would go to her.

2112
02:01:01.941 --> 02:01:02.960
Ellie I think.

2113
02:01:03.770 --> 02:01:07.700
I think so too and I go and I would hit her and I would hit her and she would

2114
02:01:07.701 --> 02:01:12.560
act like it hurt and she stagger around it.
She act like she came,
she,

2115
02:01:14.470 --> 02:01:19.010
she,
she's really committed to it.

2116
02:01:19.011 --> 02:01:20.420
She would start off in like deep,

2117
02:01:20.421 --> 02:01:25.040
deep pain and then she would start coming and then she would start coming after

2118
02:01:25.041 --> 02:01:29.240
the initial impact of the punch row in a way that like only someone who really

2119
02:01:29.241 --> 02:01:33.560
probably enjoys a good twat punch could deliver it.
She mean she embodied that.

2120
02:01:33.570 --> 02:01:37.910
He did the idea of it,
but she was a w we would have a long,
I mean we have this,

2121
02:01:37.940 --> 02:01:40.040
this thing that was running the comedy store four

2122
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:44.900
<v 5>fucking years while I'd go,
do you have any,
um,
do you have any change?</v>

2123
02:01:45.370 --> 02:01:47.430
Um,
hold on a second.
And she would just start my house,

2124
02:01:49.930 --> 02:01:54.320
enter a pinch.
Like
Oh,

2125
02:01:54.500 --> 02:01:59.270
and she would like completely commit eyes,
close legs,
pinched together,

2126
02:01:59.450 --> 02:02:03.350
toes pigeon fee.
And He'd be like,
I mean,
I only need like a quarter.

2127
02:02:03.351 --> 02:02:06.230
If you just have one quarter,
I'll give you a dollar.
No,
no,
no.
Hold on,
hold on,

2128
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:09.250
hold on.
I'm going to get it.
Get it.

2129
02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:14.630
And it was so over the top and every time she would do it,

2130
02:02:14.631 --> 02:02:17.000
you would try to top it because you know we could,

2131
02:02:17.001 --> 02:02:20.800
we're doing the same goddamn gag over and over the years,
you know,

2132
02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:24.260
so she would try to try to double it over.
But I remember the can punch.

2133
02:02:24.530 --> 02:02:25.750
I remember when you would come Poncho,

2134
02:02:27.050 --> 02:02:29.720
and I think you stomped on the ground to pro wrestling style.

2135
02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:37.010
Check this out.
John Albert,
Robert William App provide.

2136
02:02:57.830 --> 02:03:01.550
<v 2>That was Robert by the way.
There it goes.</v>

2137
02:03:03.130 --> 02:03:03.963
<v 14>Okay.</v>

2138
02:03:04.180 --> 02:03:05.490
<v 2>He wears that same shirt everywhere.</v>

2139
02:03:05.491 --> 02:03:09.070
He goes that same outfit screen and it keeps up.

2140
02:03:09.580 --> 02:03:12.490
What does that paper plate that he carries around with that's covered up with

2141
02:03:12.540 --> 02:03:16.810
aluminum foil and stuff like that and paper plate covered up with a room and he

2142
02:03:16.811 --> 02:03:19.540
keeps it like he protects his head from lasers.

2143
02:03:19.541 --> 02:03:23.470
Remember he used to always take like,
like,
like,
like this,
you know,

2144
02:03:23.471 --> 02:03:26.880
block his head because he thinks people are shooting lasers at him when he wants

2145
02:03:26.881 --> 02:03:27.790
him to the company store.

2146
02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:33.050
<v 5>Yeah.
Whoa.
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.
Lasers.
Yeah.</v>

2147
02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:35.790
What is it?
You know,
I wonder if it's,

2148
02:03:36.180 --> 02:03:41.180
if he was crazy always or if one day just reality just became too difficult or,

2149
02:03:42.541 --> 02:03:44.880
I've never seen them.
Not Crazy,
so I wouldn't,
I mean,

2150
02:03:45.060 --> 02:03:48.630
but isn't it weird that there's like two shades of crazy and he's functioning?

2151
02:03:48.990 --> 02:03:53.070
He's functioning.
How does he make a living?
I don't know.
No,
I dunno.
I Dunno.

2152
02:03:53.100 --> 02:03:56.970
I Dunno.
Um,
but he does get on stage of the store still goes up.

2153
02:03:57.780 --> 02:04:01.030
<v 2>There's Don Buress is like at a store and Roberts</v>

2154
02:04:01.420 --> 02:04:02.253
<v 0>walking.</v>

2155
02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:11.140
<v 5>Right.
It's funny.
There's a bunch of Paris.
It's so crazy.
It's so awesome.</v>

2156
02:04:12.070 --> 02:04:16.210
He's one of those guys that just like I said about your it guys who are around,

2157
02:04:16.211 --> 02:04:20.800
you automatically have a smile,
you know,
it add Robert Right here

2158
02:04:27.870 --> 02:04:28.471
<v 2>and was it he,</v>

2159
02:04:28.471 --> 02:04:32.530
one of the original guys that was supposed to take over for a Letterman and

2160
02:04:32.540 --> 02:04:35.700
that's what he used to always talk about.
What like he was,
there's that,

2161
02:04:35.701 --> 02:04:37.450
there's the aluminum.
Yeah.

2162
02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:45.640
<v 7>Yeah.
He was one of the guys.</v>

2163
02:04:45.650 --> 02:04:50.320
Was he cool with them doing this and putting this shit online?
Oh,

2164
02:04:50.380 --> 02:04:52.740
they're following him around and just filming him.
Dude,

2165
02:04:54.340 --> 02:04:56.010
this is probably not the best thing.

2166
02:04:56.880 --> 02:04:59.700
I wonder if they had gotten his permission for this.
Is that Charles Fleischer?

2167
02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:04.470
Here's a guy,
I haven't seen it forever.
This is for the folks watching at home.

2168
02:05:04.710 --> 02:05:09.570
They just following around.
A guy who has a slippery grip on reality,

2169
02:05:11.160 --> 02:05:13.740
but a nice enough guy.
Yeah,
he's really,
I always tried to talk to them,

2170
02:05:13.741 --> 02:05:15.600
but it sounds it's impossible and how to talk to them.

2171
02:05:15.601 --> 02:05:18.420
Like I even tried to give him a joint the other day and he just ran away,

2172
02:05:18.450 --> 02:05:19.060
isn't it?

2173
02:05:19.060 --> 02:05:22.330
<v 1>Seeing how the storage is sort of like attracts those types of characters and</v>

2174
02:05:22.360 --> 02:05:25.410
Sony,
I mean we've talked about it so many times with that,

2175
02:05:25.411 --> 02:05:27.310
that vortex of Hollywood,

2176
02:05:27.311 --> 02:05:31.380
that whole area between like the Rainbow Room and the rock Roxy and you know

2177
02:05:31.450 --> 02:05:34.720
where the viper room is and all the way down to the store,

2178
02:05:34.721 --> 02:05:39.721
his house and even the laugh factory like that area is so strange that such a

2179
02:05:40.031 --> 02:05:42.940
vortex of bizarre people for the viper room,

2180
02:05:43.240 --> 02:05:46.570
especially if you ever done stand up there.
No,
I haven't.

2181
02:05:46.600 --> 02:05:50.620
I've seen a lot of music there and also the rainbows like that eighties.
Yeah.

2182
02:05:50.650 --> 02:05:53.370
Tight pants,
rocker.
Look,
they won't let it go.
They,

2183
02:05:53.400 --> 02:05:58.200
they found a spot [inaudible] agreed to all go there.
Yeah.
They,

2184
02:05:58.210 --> 02:05:59.620
they found a spot where,
you know,

2185
02:05:59.621 --> 02:06:02.920
you're going to be able to see someone from that era is going to come buy.

2186
02:06:03.010 --> 02:06:06.760
It reminds me of the Kennison days that that place.
Yeah,
right.

2187
02:06:06.880 --> 02:06:10.180
He used to talk about it.
It is,
he was a,
his HBO special.

2188
02:06:10.210 --> 02:06:11.830
He talks about the rainbow bar and grill,

2189
02:06:12.040 --> 02:06:15.130
but meeting crazy girls over there that you uh,

2190
02:06:15.131 --> 02:06:18.550
that can't wait to meet you and blame their whole miserable,

2191
02:06:18.551 --> 02:06:19.870
fucked up life on you.

2192
02:06:22.640 --> 02:06:26.830
He had some great tortured relationship shit.
Uh,
he was funny.

2193
02:06:26.920 --> 02:06:30.130
One of the best right when it comes to tortured relationship.
Shit.

2194
02:06:30.300 --> 02:06:34.890
<v 3>I was married for fucking years talking about God meeting the devil.</v>

2195
02:06:35.750 --> 02:06:40.260
How it would be like club med,
how old be like club med.

2196
02:06:42.420 --> 02:06:44.190
<v 1>He was a real game changer.
That dude,</v>

2197
02:06:46.500 --> 02:06:47.820
it's hard to change the game today.

2198
02:06:47.850 --> 02:06:51.540
Everybody's seen everything with the Internet the way it is now.

2199
02:06:51.750 --> 02:06:55.770
It's amazing how much more educated people are today and how much more weird

2200
02:06:55.771 --> 02:06:58.040
shit information.
Those too.
Yeah,

2201
02:06:58.400 --> 02:06:59.270
<v 3>keep changes.
The,</v>

2202
02:06:59.600 --> 02:07:03.620
I did a bit about how there's no place to go and comedy.

2203
02:07:03.621 --> 02:07:05.920
I don't know if you're with somebody this base,
like they said,

2204
02:07:05.930 --> 02:07:08.660
we've been the sac religious as you can be as vulgar as you can be.

2205
02:07:08.661 --> 02:07:12.860
The only thing left to do is actually come on the crowd or the guy at the end of

2206
02:07:12.861 --> 02:07:15.950
his act,
his pants up and up and he just started like a fucking machine gun.

2207
02:07:15.951 --> 02:07:17.570
People are,
people are running out yet,

2208
02:07:17.571 --> 02:07:20.200
but you can't help but turn and look back and you get it right in the Mia.

2209
02:07:21.120 --> 02:07:24.990
<v 1>Imagine easily a culture where it would be okay if the performer came on the</v>

2210
02:07:24.991 --> 02:07:27.750
audience.
There's way worse shit out there.

2211
02:07:28.200 --> 02:07:31.050
There's way crazier shit out there that people are doing.
I mean you've just,

2212
02:07:31.051 --> 02:07:33.090
even,
circumcision is pretty fucking nuts.

2213
02:07:33.300 --> 02:07:36.220
Cut and baby decks had been cut and decks for thousands of years.

2214
02:07:38.770 --> 02:07:42.630
<v 5>It's so living.
Remember that show?
No.</v>

2215
02:07:44.980 --> 02:07:49.570
Some Sitcom with some chick that was on,
I think she was on celebrity rehab.

2216
02:07:49.690 --> 02:07:54.220
One of the first ones
I remember he was George Jetson,

2217
02:07:55.640 --> 02:08:00.010
his dog l role.
And what year was the Jetsons supposed to be in the future?

2218
02:08:00.011 --> 02:08:01.030
Like 1980 [inaudible].

2219
02:08:03.850 --> 02:08:07.390
Isn't it funny that like when you go and look at Shit like that,

2220
02:08:07.391 --> 02:08:10.140
they thought was going to be like blade runner appointment.

2221
02:08:10.141 --> 02:08:14.710
Do you know when blade runner was supposed to be taking place in 2019 Oh really?

2222
02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:15.633
Yeah.

2223
02:08:17.140 --> 02:08:21.300
<v 12>What is this?
It's a living.
I don't remember this at all.
Wow.</v>

2224
02:08:22.180 --> 02:08:23.300
Look at all these fake,

2225
02:08:28.620 --> 02:08:29.560
Ooh,
she's Melfi

2226
02:08:31.750 --> 02:08:36.660
where all these women now don't,
don't even bring it up,
but she's high level.

2227
02:08:36.670 --> 02:08:41.380
She's still hot.
It's got a lot of Melfi Shit gone.
That's Melfi

2228
02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:43.900
hope she works out.

2229
02:08:43.990 --> 02:08:47.860
She's printing somebody put a Photoshop together with where all these girls look

2230
02:08:47.861 --> 02:08:51.640
like now
and Jillian,
I know her.

2231
02:08:52.450 --> 02:08:56.350
I did.
And did a roast would Mike did gives you his own,
is that guy a comic?

2232
02:08:58.270 --> 02:09:02.170
I Dunno.
Sweared sitcoms.
Wacky chef.

2233
02:09:06.370 --> 02:09:11.060
I've never seen the show before me crazy.
Just go with Thomas.
What

2234
02:09:11.070 --> 02:09:15.090
<v 5>time?
What year was that?
But Standing Thomas' son?
Yeah.
What year was that?</v>

2235
02:09:15.110 --> 02:09:18.050
That it's a living was on the air show.
I never saw that show.

2236
02:09:18.590 --> 02:09:20.930
I don't know why I remember that.
Not only that,

2237
02:09:20.931 --> 02:09:25.910
you remember the theme 19 1980s is always 1980s wow.

2238
02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:29.390
I remember that show was,
I think I was in high school.
It was on the air.

2239
02:09:30.140 --> 02:09:35.140
He's amazing how much culture has evolved from that to,

2240
02:09:35.390 --> 02:09:39.620
uh,
what's Larry David's show?
Caribbean,
Caribbean.
Tuesday.
You think of that?

2241
02:09:39.710 --> 02:09:43.400
Think of the difference between that show how complex and hilarious and

2242
02:09:45.800 --> 02:09:50.390
brilliant and multilayered and facet is where it just gets twisted up into

2243
02:09:50.391 --> 02:09:52.990
things.
We're,
you know,
I mean he went,

2244
02:09:52.991 --> 02:09:55.650
remember when they had a water bottle in his pants and the girl came in the

2245
02:09:55.651 --> 02:09:59.050
bathroom.
I mean,
he's just,
he's unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

2246
02:09:59.051 --> 02:10:02.120
Just to say that a friend of mine worked for both the,

2247
02:10:02.180 --> 02:10:05.180
everybody loves Raymond and Seinfeld and he said to me,

2248
02:10:05.210 --> 02:10:08.600
Raymond was so simple cause it was in a plot.
The whole show is,

2249
02:10:08.601 --> 02:10:13.310
and they plot sometimes a B Seinfeld was ABCD and they throw everything.
Oh yeah,

2250
02:10:13.311 --> 02:10:15.680
we hit the golf ball.
It goes into the wheels.

2251
02:10:15.690 --> 02:10:20.680
Blowhole and Jason Alexander Lives about being a marine biologist,
biologist,

2252
02:10:20.900 --> 02:10:25.010
everything for the way everything fit together in 22 minutes clean and they had

2253
02:10:25.011 --> 02:10:28.790
to work clean.
Yeah,
it wasn't brilliant.
Brilliant show and you know,

2254
02:10:28.791 --> 02:10:32.840
if you look at like those old father knows best and it's almost like a different

2255
02:10:33.050 --> 02:10:36.050
species of thing,
like people were so stupid.

2256
02:10:36.650 --> 02:10:41.060
How could you have this show on the air who the w you realize how naive culture

2257
02:10:41.061 --> 02:10:42.500
was just Justin.

2258
02:10:43.250 --> 02:10:46.580
The only one that holds up holds up to me and makes me live stills Andy of

2259
02:10:46.580 --> 02:10:46.940
Mayberry,

2260
02:10:46.940 --> 02:10:49.400
which just listen to what you said about the twilight's on that holds up.

2261
02:10:49.430 --> 02:10:49.811
That's true.

2262
02:10:49.811 --> 02:10:53.000
I love that they wake up and they realized they were actually getting further

2263
02:10:53.001 --> 02:10:56.750
away from the son.
Jesus Christ.
Creepy,
creepy fucking challenge.

2264
02:10:56.780 --> 02:11:00.760
Twilight zone was amazing.
Remember to serve man.
Yes,
the aliens came.

2265
02:11:00.790 --> 02:11:02.840
It was a cookbook.
Cookbook.
It's a cookbook.

2266
02:11:05.870 --> 02:11:06.470
Well,

2267
02:11:06.470 --> 02:11:10.430
if you think about the way we treat dolphins and the way we treat killer whales,

2268
02:11:10.490 --> 02:11:13.410
I would think that if aliens came here,
they might either fuck us or eat us.

2269
02:11:13.750 --> 02:11:17.080
It's very possible.
Right.
If they were way smarter than us,
if we're,

2270
02:11:17.270 --> 02:11:18.620
if they look at us,
we're so stupid,

2271
02:11:18.621 --> 02:11:21.950
we're still using nuclear power and he assholes or pollute and everything.

2272
02:11:21.951 --> 02:11:26.060
You know,
he give a fuck and they Adidas.
That's why I have a poor diet diet.

2273
02:11:26.061 --> 02:11:29.270
I don't want to be delicious to those.
Well,
you really think about it,
you'd die.

2274
02:11:29.271 --> 02:11:34.020
It probably makes you delicious.
Yeah.
Like a Wagyu steak.

2275
02:11:35.840 --> 02:11:38.490
Like when they get that Coby beef.
Yeah.

2276
02:11:38.510 --> 02:11:42.590
I mean they feed it liquor and they massage it and it's perfect.
It's just like,

2277
02:11:42.591 --> 02:11:46.250
hey,
that's a day in the life on the road.

2278
02:11:46.590 --> 02:11:50.480
Get a nice deep tissue before the show loosen up.
He might,

2279
02:11:50.490 --> 02:11:53.830
if I drank while you're rubbing my back.
Yeah.

2280
02:11:55.970 --> 02:11:59.190
Do you ever get,
um,
a deep tissue massage?
No,
I don't.
I don't,

2281
02:11:59.191 --> 02:12:01.070
I'm not a big massage guy.
Really?

2282
02:12:01.580 --> 02:12:04.430
Not even at the rub and tug kind of massages I used to,

2283
02:12:04.580 --> 02:12:07.330
but I don't have any fetishes.
Those are hard to find.
Right.
Um,

2284
02:12:07.730 --> 02:12:12.060
fetishes make me a dress up in diapers or do anything weird like that?
No,

2285
02:12:12.061 --> 02:12:16.090
you're done in papers.
Brian pick the funniest fetish ever heard,

2286
02:12:16.100 --> 02:12:17.570
I don't know if it's true,
was Elton John.

2287
02:12:17.990 --> 02:12:21.500
He liked to run across the room naked and people guys would throw oranges.

2288
02:12:21.570 --> 02:12:25.140
Adam at Isaiah,
that was his thing that supposedly,

2289
02:12:25.510 --> 02:12:28.580
but that's like Rod Stewart supposedly had to get a stomach pump cause there was

2290
02:12:28.581 --> 02:12:32.630
like a court and a half ago he blew his soccer team

2291
02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:36.500
in lieu of pay.

2292
02:12:36.501 --> 02:12:40.310
I'd like to blow all of you the best rumor of all time though.

2293
02:12:40.311 --> 02:12:42.840
The king in the rumors.
There's the Richard Gere dribble up the ass Romer.

2294
02:12:44.210 --> 02:12:49.120
That's the Mike Tyson of 1985 I never had a dribble up my,

2295
02:12:49.220 --> 02:12:53.420
I think Scientology might've done it to him.
I think he had been involved.

2296
02:12:53.421 --> 02:12:54.950
Could think they really put a dribble and said no.

2297
02:12:54.951 --> 02:12:57.370
They probably spread the rumor that room or get,

2298
02:12:57.520 --> 02:12:59.600
you know Eddie Bravo grew up here in la.

2299
02:12:59.630 --> 02:13:04.440
I grew up in Boston and we both heard that rumor paper,

2300
02:13:04.590 --> 02:13:05.810
the whole country.
Joe,

2301
02:13:05.811 --> 02:13:08.620
who's the first guy that thought I'm going to put an animal in ways.

2302
02:13:09.140 --> 02:13:11.400
I think people are nuts.
They put all kinds of things in their ass.

2303
02:13:11.401 --> 02:13:12.600
I mean an animal alive.

2304
02:13:14.360 --> 02:13:17.570
There's always someone looking at tickets to the next level.
They found a guy,

2305
02:13:17.670 --> 02:13:20.720
he was drunk driving.
He had a zebra and his car,

2306
02:13:20.750 --> 02:13:24.410
a zebra and giraffe or some shit like that.
I just tweeted.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2307
02:13:24.411 --> 02:13:26.930
