1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.500
Two,
one he
edge,
blah.

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.580
Yo my man.

3
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.450
I like how we could just start the podcast like this right off the fucking

4
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.890
commercial.
I noticed that like a week ago.
Change it.

5
00:00:13.891 --> 00:00:17.040
The flow of the conversation made it way better.
Yeah,

6
00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:19.290
that was bullshit because it was like,
you know,

7
00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:21.310
when I really realized it was bullshit,
like a,

8
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.970
I did a podcast with Stan hope and he was making fun of the commercials.

9
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.720
I was doing it.
I was like,
why am I doing commercials in front of them?

10
00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:29.520
Why don't I just do that later and stitch it in?

11
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.390
And I was lucky where the deal that I had for commercials was really just for

12
00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:37.020
iTunes.
And so,
um,
like when I to do this,

13
00:00:37.021 --> 00:00:38.400
it goes on youtube first.

14
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.170
So as it streamed on youtube and youstream no need for commercials.
Fuck it.

15
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.300
So,
and then I put the ads in later.
But on iTunes and on a,

16
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.930
on Youtube,
this is no commercials.
You know when it changes too,

17
00:00:51.931 --> 00:00:56.931
is that this podcast is most of the time anyways is about just you and your

18
00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:03.420
friends just talking about bullshit.
Yeah.
You're not getting right to,

19
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.210
it's not like use the Promo code every day.
Our,
he is our,

20
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.810
he just wrote a book and he's Outta here to promote it.

21
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.550
Sometimes that happens like Paul Stanley and stuff know I get a lot of those,

22
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:17.770
but it's still,
even with them it's like you would want to,

23
00:01:17.771 --> 00:01:21.020
you want to sit them down and go,
so uh,
what's it like to write the book?
What,

24
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.730
you know,
how hard was it,
you know,
how long does it take?

25
00:01:23.731 --> 00:01:26.680
Like what's the process conversation before the podcast.
Dot.

26
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.640
There is some serious conversations that's going on.

27
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.650
And then instead of just starting and starting the podcast on a dime and then

28
00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:36.090
continuing the conversation,

29
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.870
he hit the commercials and you'd never get back to that conversation.

30
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.540
A lot of the times that's happened.
Well you know,

31
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.330
a lot of times like we haven't seen each other in like a week or two and we got

32
00:01:45.331 --> 00:01:48.990
a bunch of crazy shit to say to each other and you just start balling and then

33
00:01:48.991 --> 00:01:53.850
by the time the podcast starts,
so what's up man?
You know,
you learn,

34
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.710
you learn a lot about yourself.

35
00:01:55.711 --> 00:01:57.900
Like I'm listening to you listen to your own podcast.

36
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.350
I listened to the good ones.
I don't at all,
I can't,
I can't stand this.

37
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.190
I have no desire to listen to myself.

38
00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:09.060
The only time is when I'm going through mastering the system,
my tutorial,

39
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.420
I do sit there and I am interested in how I'm teaching and what I said and how I

40
00:02:14.821 --> 00:02:18.970
could have made the point clearer in my teaching.
So I,
I uh,

41
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.190
that's the only time,

42
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.910
but when it's a podcast and I'm not talking about you just said,

43
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.640
I'm just talking about like just bullshit.
I don't want to hear myself.

44
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.080
It's good to hear though.

45
00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:32.170
But for the same reason like you realize why you were annoying to you like I

46
00:02:32.171 --> 00:02:36.840
have,
I've found things that I didn't know I did like little s little ticks,

47
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.400
little weird things like people do like a big one is saying like people,

48
00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:44.010
like there's like Tom Segura,
I love him to death.

49
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.860
That mother fucker out likes me.
He hurts me sometimes.

50
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.470
Like there's like a way like if you got like a guy like in his like a way like

51
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.920
ah,
did he say that or everybody does and we all do it.

52
00:02:55.921 --> 00:03:00.230
We don't even know what guys are telling the story.
It's hilarious.
And

53
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.750
<v 1>he's like,
she came up to me and started mad dogging me and I was like,</v>

54
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:07.330
what the fuck you look in that I paid for all that shit.

55
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.920
And you didn't say none of that.

56
00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:13.390
You just said I was like that I had that look on my face but I didn't say shit.

57
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.440
And if you don't question did you actually say that you're like,
no.
I was like,

58
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:17.621
I was,

59
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:22.621
I was thinking it I to you would have made it seem like he was just bad mother

60
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:27.520
fucker and this story saying you didn't say shit.

61
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.250
And I was like,
fuck you pay for that shit.
He said that.
No,
no.

62
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.690
I thought it like I thought it.

63
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.720
Fuck you and all and where you came from pitch.
Do you actually say it to him?

64
00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.303
No,

65
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:53.190
I hate that.

66
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.410
<v 0>Another one that I do that I need to figure out how to stop doing.
As you say.</v>

67
00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.330
I say,
you know,
you know,
I don't know.
You know,
it's like,
you know,

68
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.310
you know like you're trying to form your point.

69
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.130
You're trying to like formulate it in your mind and now you,
you know,

70
00:04:05.131 --> 00:04:07.230
you sympathize more with black people when they're always saying,

71
00:04:07.231 --> 00:04:08.064
you know what I'm saying?

72
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.540
<v 1>You're like,
we're basically doing the same thing.
We're just not,</v>

73
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.540
not saying why are we making fun?
I know what I mean.
Everybody says,
you know,

74
00:04:15.541 --> 00:04:16.820
you know,
you know,
you know,
you know,

75
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.730
<v 0>they just say no what I'm saying.
But if they stretched it out further,</v>

76
00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:24.040
it would get even more ridiculous.
You know what I'm saying?
We're gone.

77
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.610
You know what I'm saying?
Word God.
If like,
you know what I'm saying?

78
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.250
It was like in the middle of every sentence.
I think he started something.

79
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.570
I think I'm out of star or something.
You know what I'm saying?
Work on,

80
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.710
what did you say?
Hashtag [inaudible] do you know what I'm saying?
Word Guy.
Yeah.

81
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.710
Well,
black guys were calling each other God for awhile on the east coast.

82
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.250
It was a weird thing that was going on.
Like I went to,
uh,

83
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.280
I went to see Terry Norris fight,
um,
uh,

84
00:04:48.281 --> 00:04:52.480
at a bar with a friend of mine who's a comic and his buddy,
uh,
they will,

85
00:04:52.481 --> 00:04:54.460
we work together and me and this,
this comic,

86
00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:56.620
and he brought his buddy with him and we all went to,

87
00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.180
we had Terry nars fighting tonight,
let's go.

88
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.300
I'm going to see Tara Norris fight live on whatever it was,
HBO and they,

89
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.870
they were talking to each other and they were talking to Matt.

90
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.010
He hit him with that left hook.
God,
you see that Jab,
God,
a head movement God.

91
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.080
And I was like,
Whoa,
what are they doing?
Like is this a I,
you know,

92
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.060
I'm white obviously.
So I'm like,
what am I missed a meeting like this is,

93
00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:18.760
it seems to be a new thing.
And then I remember shaking my head going,

94
00:05:18.761 --> 00:05:22.120
this will not last you guys where you're going to feel silly for calling each

95
00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:25.870
other God and a couple of years.
You can't just do this or maybe,
you know what

96
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.100
a lot of people are trying to come up with their own shit and try to make it

97
00:05:30.101 --> 00:05:34.300
stick.
You know,
some of it that was all panning out.
Some doesn't,
but people are,

98
00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:37.180
they're trying.
That was a big one though.
That was everywhere.

99
00:05:37.181 --> 00:05:39.220
It wasn't like these guys,
it was their shit.

100
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.660
It was like black guys were doing that all throughout the east coast in the 90s.

101
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.380
It's very prestigious to have your,
you're a San,

102
00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:51.610
you made up blow up.
Oh yeah.
There's one,
you know,
people always say,

103
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.110
Holler at me,
Holler at me.
Yeah.
Uh,
this guy,
uh,
uh,

104
00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.860
Rico Santana,
he started scream at me.
He was pushing that scream at me,

105
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.340
scream at them and uh,
I'm not sure if it's stuck.

106
00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.590
Never heard it.
When did he do this?
How long ago?
Five years ago it was,

107
00:06:09.591 --> 00:06:12.760
we'll try their own chest tag.
Scream at me.
Yeah.
You don't,

108
00:06:12.761 --> 00:06:16.910
you want to punch someone to Holla at Ya.
But Hala is what's up.
You know,

109
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.940
this is not scream at you implies like they're angry at you.
You're like,

110
00:06:19.941 --> 00:06:23.000
you're setting yourself up for,
I like it.
Scream at me,
scream at me,

111
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:27.290
bitch screaming man.
But you say it like in a sexy.
Oh,
okay.
Right.

112
00:06:27.291 --> 00:06:30.170
Like you tell the chick screen touch.
Eric's gonna stop calling you.

113
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.050
She's going to run a wash.
Dot.
I'm not gonna respond to your text now.

114
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:37.430
It's going to be like,
come on Z.
Imagine that instead of call me later.

115
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.910
Scream at me.
I said,
if you said it like that.
Well you're a funny guy.

116
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.250
So you said it like that.
It will probably work because she would,

117
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.010
she would start laughing,
you know?
Speeding.
Alright,

118
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.620
well listen,
you like to die but you later.

119
00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.370
Oh that's going to work for a women.

120
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.200
How the fuck did those ticks?
Like little things like that.
Like,

121
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.960
you know what I'm saying?
You know,
it's like,
like where are those coming from?

122
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.660
And then they're basically the complicated versus ah,

123
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.220
even fucking like a lot of times people will use fucking fucking fucking guy was

124
00:07:13.221 --> 00:07:16.660
his fucking same thing.
That's all there.
They're elongated version.

125
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.090
Fucking is the worst.
Right?
Do that a lot too.
I used to,

126
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.210
when you're younger you do that more and you're nervous,
nervous.

127
00:07:23.211 --> 00:07:26.930
There's a lot of fucking nervous like fuck man.
And then I was like fucking,

128
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.840
and he was like,
fucking,
I don't give a fuck.
And I was like,

129
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:33.890
fucking fuck that dude.
When I was doing standup in Boston date,

130
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.720
they had a thing they used to call the fuck meter.

131
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.690
There was saying like if you're going to go do standup,
they would say,
Eddie,

132
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.610
don't break the fuck meter.
Like when you use them,
they should mean something.

133
00:07:43.611 --> 00:07:44.960
And there was,
there were so right.

134
00:07:44.961 --> 00:07:49.040
It taught me so much because when I see a guy who says,
fuck too much,

135
00:07:49.041 --> 00:07:50.870
I know that guys nervous.
You know,

136
00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:53.960
if he starts fuckings fucking I'm walking down the fucking street and this

137
00:07:53.961 --> 00:07:58.040
fucking chick fucking,
it's like you're off.
There's something off your,
you're,

138
00:07:58.041 --> 00:08:01.670
you're using one word too many times,
no matter what word it is.

139
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.170
And if it happens to be fucking like you're trying to sound like you're
together,

140
00:08:06.171 --> 00:08:09.260
you're trying to sound like you're upset,
but you're not really,
or if you're,

141
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.990
if you are upset,
you need to collect your thoughts,
you know,

142
00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:15.050
and that that's what he hear.
That when you listen to a podcast,

143
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:18.680
whereas is you just thought,
most of the time you're just talking.
You don't,

144
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:23.720
you don't remember how you said it.
You just don't.
Very little.
Very rarely,

145
00:08:23.721 --> 00:08:25.520
unless something really crazy happens.

146
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:30.200
You know how often you really remember how he said things?
What's a buddy?

147
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.410
No,
I'm just thinking,
man.

148
00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.610
I bet her head say it's something that I probably should not talk,

149
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:45.020
but it's funny to me,
but it's not podcast material.
Oh,
sorry.

150
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:50.000
The one thing that I had,
Eddie Bravo,
we'll write that down,
Jamie.
We're getting,

151
00:08:50.001 --> 00:08:52.270
is it not a chance in hell?
Are you gonna remember what we talked about?
Either.

152
00:08:52.271 --> 00:08:55.190
That's the word.
I mean,
maybe I will write it in my notes.

153
00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.440
<v 1>Oh Man.
Notes are huge.
God dammit.</v>

154
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.650
<v 2>Do you use notes when you do your notes for every motherfucking do you do them</v>

155
00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:08.430
for seminars or did everything really?
All my notes.
Like on your phone,

156
00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:12.020
you've ever read thing?
I you transcribe it.
All my shit.
Do,
do,

157
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:16.380
do the voice transcription thing.
No.
Oh,
it's so good dude.
So good.

158
00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:18.870
So accurate.
It's kind of,
yeah,
I use it all the time.

159
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.680
Like if I'm in my car and I got an idea,
I used to get panicky.
I be like,
fuck,

160
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:23.521
I got to pull over.

161
00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:26.850
And it started coming up with reasons to say the idea over and over and over

162
00:09:26.851 --> 00:09:28.020
again so that I didn't forget it.

163
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.910
Now just grab that phone and hit that button and go blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

164
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.700
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Put it down.
I'm gone.

165
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.810
<v 1>Yeah,
there's,
I use it for Jujitsu a lot for teaching.</v>

166
00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:43.840
There's so much shit to master and she gets,

167
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.530
it's so vast.

168
00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.770
<v 2>It seems like it's getting crazier to,
with the advent,</v>

169
00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:51.130
like the more attention that people would putting on leg locks these days.

170
00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:54.640
It seems like I'm watching Jujitsu and I'm like,
man,
I'm not,
you know,

171
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:57.970
I s I see transitions on the ground that I understand,

172
00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.770
but when I see some leg lock transitions,
I'm like,

173
00:09:59.771 --> 00:10:02.530
I have no idea where these guys are going.
Yeah,
I just see scrambles.

174
00:10:02.531 --> 00:10:05.260
I'm going to show he's a,
I'd have to watch that again and again and again.

175
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:06.690
See how he set that up.

176
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:10.830
<v 1>Yeah,
you just got to get it broken down to you and in a system,</v>

177
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:15.020
just like the rubber guard,
cause you would have,
you have fifth degree,

178
00:10:15.021 --> 00:10:15.840
six degree,

179
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.230
eighth degree black belts out there and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and they've never

180
00:10:19.231 --> 00:10:23.110
really looked into the rubber guard at all.
And they think,

181
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.820
oh they just throw on their legs up and they're grabbing their leg and then

182
00:10:26.821 --> 00:10:30.660
there's an arm bar or triangle on a guys slip out and then they're just grabbing

183
00:10:30.661 --> 00:10:34.860
their ankles.
They don't realize how precise and microscopic it is.

184
00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.410
And uh,
that's what I used to think of.

185
00:10:37.411 --> 00:10:40.260
Leg locks and leg locks where you just jump on legs.

186
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.410
I'm a black belt and I'm still thinking this until about a year ago.

187
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:44.940
I bought dude's just jumping on.

188
00:10:44.941 --> 00:10:47.430
You get that outside one or you get that inside one.

189
00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:51.760
I was pretty good at a heel hook comment off being mounted.
Uh,

190
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:55.890
but I didn't spend a lot of time with your hooks.
It just seemed like,
Ooh,

191
00:10:55.891 --> 00:10:59.070
I don't want to get my uh,
you know,
MMA fighters.

192
00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:03.420
I want to set up a good MMA example cause I'm not going to be the one going in

193
00:11:03.421 --> 00:11:07.550
the cage.
So if I'm trying to teach them to shit,
I better be doing this shit.
So,

194
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:11.250
so I thought it's not a good idea to,

195
00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:16.350
to always go for leg locks.
If,
if you're going to do MMA,

196
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:21.420
it's uh,
it's a great like second or third option,

197
00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:24.540
last resort,
nothing's working.
You can't take the guy down.

198
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:28.040
You tried and maybe you almost got them down.
You almost pass the guard.

199
00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:32.250
The guy's a beast.
It's not working,
nothing's working.
He's throwing you around,

200
00:11:32.251 --> 00:11:36.480
nothing's working.
It's a third round.
You might tell this guy if,

201
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:40.200
if this guy in the gym was really good at leg locks,

202
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:43.170
this is where your town let's fucking go after his legs is uh,

203
00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.750
the chokes aren't working.
We're not getting anywhere near his neck.

204
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:46.950
You got one more round.

205
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:49.680
Thank God that you could actually pull this off because you're really good at

206
00:11:49.681 --> 00:11:53.070
leg locks.
That's,
that's what it was like a last ditch effort.
Yeah.

207
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:54.213
Resort if shitting

208
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.620
<v 3>work cause it's risky,
they can work,</v>

209
00:11:56.650 --> 00:12:00.210
but if they don't work and on the bottom you're going to get Alan belcherd.

210
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:03.760
You know what I'm saying?
And uh,
the,
uh,

211
00:12:03.761 --> 00:12:07.720
the best leg locker in the game right now as Eddie Cummings,
he,
uh,

212
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:12.140
he's an Ebi one 45 champion.
He,
he's incredible.

213
00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.560
He's incredible.
He's like the more Garcia of leg locks.

214
00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.470
You say I'm Alan Belcher's.
We should explain what you mean.

215
00:12:17.471 --> 00:12:19.210
Like when he fought Paul Horez,
Paul Harris,

216
00:12:19.211 --> 00:12:20.920
who's like the best leg locker and MMA,

217
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:25.660
Alan Belcher thought long and hard about this and worked a lot on the strategy

218
00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:28.170
and did a lot of leg locked.
He brought in,
he flew and he,

219
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:32.100
he trains in Tennessee,
Alabama.
I said,

220
00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:36.640
Alabama guy to Biloxi,
Mississippi.
I mean,
he's got his gym now.
I forgot,

221
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:39.170
I forgot one of those places down in [inaudible],

222
00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:46.050
but he flew in Dean lister for that fight and Dobby Ramos who just won Abu

223
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:51.480
Dhabi,
that guy's an animal,
saw that flying arm bar.
That guy's,
that guy's a new,

224
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:56.170
uh,
new,
the new star in town and he's got to be Ronald cause brass.
Alan Belcher,

225
00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.600
three years ago,
two years ago,
whenever that fight was,

226
00:12:58.601 --> 00:13:00.790
it was probably at least three years ago when that happened.

227
00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.790
When his fight with Rusa,

228
00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:06.850
Paul Hersey flew both of them in and he was already known it as a really good

229
00:13:06.851 --> 00:13:11.550
leg locker and yoked and shit.
It looks like a mini little Paul Harris,

230
00:13:11.551 --> 00:13:14.740
a little smaller.
And Alan Belcher said,

231
00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:18.670
Dean lister and Dobby Ramos just rectum with legs for a month straight.

232
00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:22.990
Just wrecked them and he just forced them,
forced them to learn.

233
00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:26.800
Little by little,
you're fine,
you're safe spots.

234
00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:31.420
You figure out where you're safe and maybe you're not getting out or escaping.

235
00:13:31.421 --> 00:13:34.720
But let's figure out where we could stay safe and then we'll think about the

236
00:13:34.721 --> 00:13:37.300
escape later.
You know,
that's how it all started.

237
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.910
And then you get really good at boom at staying at then say,

238
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:45.010
just gone right through that safe zone who write to the escapes because you
know,

239
00:13:45.011 --> 00:13:48.640
you've done it so much the slow way and then it starts blending little by little

240
00:13:48.641 --> 00:13:52.980
boom.
Uh,
but anyways,
uh,

241
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:58.090
Alan Belcher eventually learned how to deal with leg locks amazingly.
Yeah.

242
00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:00.580
And then he proved it in the octagon,

243
00:14:00.581 --> 00:14:05.230
in the UFC against the scariest leg lock out there.
Still to this day,

244
00:14:05.231 --> 00:14:07.120
still the scariest leg lock out there.

245
00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:11.550
And Paul Harris had many shots at Allen's leg.

246
00:14:11.551 --> 00:14:14.920
He would escape and then Rusa more parts has this elaborate system.

247
00:14:14.921 --> 00:14:17.080
He knows exactly what he's doing.
It's,
it's,

248
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:22.320
you have to spend a lot of time there and really analyze the possibilities and

249
00:14:22.451 --> 00:14:25.000
all the angles when you're attacking legs.

250
00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:28.750
It really is an entirely different system,
just lens.

251
00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:33.220
But we're also learning that it's not a be all end all,
especially in MMA.

252
00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.310
Paul Harris has been jacked a couple of times.
And even the best guy right now,

253
00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:38.530
Eddie Cummings,
when he goes in and he competes,

254
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:40.690
he's tapping everybody with heel hooks,

255
00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:44.200
but he needs two or three tries at those legs.

256
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:47.290
Guys going to defend the first time.
It's always the same was matters.

257
00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:50.460
You'll get guys really quick to 30 seconds,
12 seconds,
boom.

258
00:14:50.461 --> 00:14:52.080
He just jumps on and he's like,
dude,
you're

259
00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:56.900
<v 1>like,
oh shit.
You know,
he has,
but generally against the top guy,</v>

260
00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.290
the guy's gonna pull out of a shit like two or three times.

261
00:15:00.291 --> 00:15:03.470
Eddie might just let them,
let them think that,
oh look,
I can't control them.

262
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:06.110
And then just setting them up,
just playing with the,

263
00:15:06.111 --> 00:15:07.640
letting them go and then coming back.

264
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:12.220
Just knowing that he's going to get those legs eventually wearing you out even.

265
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:15.590
Yes.
And then button MMA,
man,

266
00:15:15.591 --> 00:15:18.510
you got to go in there to better work that first fucking time because I've,

267
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:22.070
that guy's finds a little safe zone and he has a safe zone where he could punch

268
00:15:22.071 --> 00:15:26.210
you.
It could be lights out.
Yeah.
Risky.
Very dangerous.

269
00:15:26.211 --> 00:15:29.920
So regardless of,
uh,
how,
uh,

270
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:34.920
sophisticated and awesome leg locks our overall right now in grappling still in

271
00:15:34.921 --> 00:15:38.090
MMA,
they're still dangerous.
But,
uh,

272
00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:43.420
it's very important secret weapon when you know the safe,

273
00:15:44.091 --> 00:15:45.920
safer stuff,
like,
you know,

274
00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:49.730
taking them down and passing and scarred and mounting them and getting his back

275
00:15:49.731 --> 00:15:53.140
and nice and safe.
You're not going to reverse shit on me.
I'm going to,

276
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:57.260
you can't punch me.
You can't punch me.
I'm all over you.
Boom,
Bam,
Bam,

277
00:15:57.261 --> 00:16:01.370
nice and safe and dominating.
You know,
it's always a,

278
00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:05.690
a better idea to try to do that first.
If you can do that,

279
00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:10.310
why would you give him a chance at your face while you're gone for leg locks?

280
00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.940
You might get it,
but you're giving them a shot,
man.

281
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:17.270
All he's got to do is be a little bit good at d,
defending a little bit,

282
00:16:17.271 --> 00:16:19.780
defend that shit.
He's used to it.
Pam,
Pam,
done.

283
00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:23.180
<v 4>If,
especially if you've got a guy,
you remember that Cro,
cop,
Gonzaga fight,</v>

284
00:16:23.181 --> 00:16:27.710
the last one or cro cop was on top of Gonzaga and blasting and with elbows.

285
00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:30.770
And you saw what happens when you get a scary,

286
00:16:30.771 --> 00:16:35.030
scary striker like cro cop on top of you and you're not controlling his posture.

287
00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.840
Oh yeah,
yeah.
Can't forget that kind of shit.

288
00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:42.230
Can't forget that because cro cop might be the only guy we've seen do it like

289
00:16:42.231 --> 00:16:46.270
that to it that quickly.
Devastatingly.
But that means it's possible.
Like you,

290
00:16:46.271 --> 00:16:49.070
it just cause you're in someone's guard that she doesn't save.
You know,

291
00:16:49.071 --> 00:16:52.640
like Tito didn't ever,
and Tito never had the kind of um,

292
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:57.320
the kind of speed and precision as a striker.
The Cro cop has,
so Krakow's elbows,

293
00:16:57.321 --> 00:16:59.330
even as short,
elbows are just so devastating.

294
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.780
But Tito use to fuck guys up from inside their guard.

295
00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.330
The even never bothered pass and people's guard,

296
00:17:05.331 --> 00:17:09.020
it's like good luck holding on and me boom.
And he would just jack guys.

297
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.020
<v 1>And the best ever was Uriah Faber.</v>

298
00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.510
Nobody threw elbows better than him cause he was so small and it,

299
00:17:15.511 --> 00:17:20.390
his opponent was so small,
he could lie.
Lay in,
pray in someone's full guard,

300
00:17:20.391 --> 00:17:21.890
lamb,
pray,
lay on him.

301
00:17:21.891 --> 00:17:26.600
Just because he top guys got us clinch to bottom guys throwing elbows.

302
00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:31.010
Bottom guy could punish.
So you're,
you know,
if you're in someone's guard,

303
00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.160
you're in some danger with strikes to and submissions.

304
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.640
If the guy knows what he's doing.
But he would pick dudes up,
he'd be land pray,

305
00:17:37.641 --> 00:17:38.990
but then he would like spring up,

306
00:17:38.991 --> 00:17:41.660
like he's doing some kind of like back extension.

307
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:46.390
He'd pick them up and then slam them on the ground,
followed by an elder,

308
00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:50.310
like a rhythm.
Papa,
Papa.
He'd lift him up.
He lifted him up.

309
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:54.780
I was a fucking amazing rhythm.
That was the king of the cage days,
right?
No,

310
00:17:54.781 --> 00:17:59.670
that was WEC days.
That was before the UFC bought the WDC.

311
00:17:59.671 --> 00:18:00.710
This was back when it was

312
00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:06.600
somewhere in San Luis Obispo or some shit.
It's way up north.
Right?
Yeah.

313
00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.400
And he used to fuck people up like that.

314
00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:11.380
But then he learned how to pass the guard and he got really good at Jujitsu.
So,

315
00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:12.930
so instead of standing there,

316
00:18:12.931 --> 00:18:15.960
he thought even this guy with the most devastating ground and pound,

317
00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.670
you don't see it anymore because he's going to try to pass the guard and mount

318
00:18:18.671 --> 00:18:19.950
you and take it back and choke you.

319
00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:24.300
He knows the way now is geared teens too is when he gets a hold of dudes next.

320
00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:27.480
He's so nasty.
Yeah.
Cause good teens are just so tight.
Quick.

321
00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:28.740
When you think of someone,

322
00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.700
you think you try to think of a UFC fighter who's known,

323
00:18:32.701 --> 00:18:36.870
who's known for a special submission that like you,
like Rhonda,

324
00:18:36.871 --> 00:18:40.920
you're like arm bar.
Ronda armbar battles to ask.
You know what I mean?
Pam,

325
00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:44.700
there's only a few guys that you see the submission right next to him,

326
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:49.060
right when someone talks about him and your ifa,
but he's got that little,

327
00:18:49.061 --> 00:18:52.530
that little special guillotine.
He does are so many different ways to guillotine,

328
00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:57.370
uh,
next so many different ways and the way that,
uh,
uh,

329
00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:01.800
um,
Uriah faber doesn't,
I'm,
I'm not even good at that way.

330
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:04.740
I never been getting that position.
I never find myself in that one.

331
00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.960
It's like a whole beautiful little path and just to dangerous chuck,

332
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:11.490
I really got to sit down and look into it.

333
00:19:11.491 --> 00:19:13.980
Really now that I'm thinking about and talking to him,
I'm like,
what am I doing?

334
00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.050
I've got to say there's just so much to do.

335
00:19:16.051 --> 00:19:17.490
That was the beginning of this conversation.

336
00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:21.450
There's so much to teach after write shit in my notes.
Boom.
I brought it back.

337
00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:25.290
That's the one thing that I hate listening to myself talk is cause I'll have

338
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:28.830
like a story I want to say,
but then I think,
okay,
let me set it up.

339
00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:30.480
So when I'm listening to my shit,

340
00:19:30.481 --> 00:19:34.920
I used to listen to my podcast and I see it and I'm dissecting like what I do.

341
00:19:34.921 --> 00:19:36.180
I'm like,
I'm trying to make a point,

342
00:19:36.181 --> 00:19:41.181
but I never get to the point because I go so far back to set it up that by the

343
00:19:41.401 --> 00:19:45.720
time I get to the point I already thought of another story and I go way over

344
00:19:45.721 --> 00:19:49.440
here and a,
it's called weed.
Yes.
Yes.

345
00:19:49.441 --> 00:19:54.390
I hate that about me.
Shit.
So when I hear myself doing,
I go,
there,
I go start,

346
00:19:54.391 --> 00:19:57.120
I'm talking about something else.
Never even finished the fucking point.

347
00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:01.530
I had a good point too and I just forgot about it.
I never got to it.
It's,

348
00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:03.960
we all do that.
It's when you get high,

349
00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.990
I digress so much and then it becomes a game.

350
00:20:06.991 --> 00:20:11.280
Like let's try to figure out where this all started.
We're trying to backtrack.

351
00:20:11.281 --> 00:20:12.430
Boom,
boom,
boom.
Okay.

352
00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:15.770
<v 4>We do the exact same thing.
Yeah,
I do it all the time on this podcast.</v>

353
00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:19.850
If we get high,
I just goes on its own.
You know,

354
00:20:19.851 --> 00:20:23.600
it's like you began to excel.
Maybe we should let people know before the podcast.

355
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:27.500
This is a marijuana induced podcasts.
Some of them are so,
or this one's not.

356
00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.320
So there you go.
If you,
if you're like going,

357
00:20:30.321 --> 00:20:32.850
what the fuck are they talking about?
Well that does that too.

358
00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.760
We decides what you want to talk about.
Yeah.

359
00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.810
<v 1>And now you've got Ryan Hall,
man,
that's a,</v>

360
00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.230
now we got a little dude who's coming in with the uh,

361
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:45.970
who some are porous type threat to the legs as well.
How good is he going to do?

362
00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:47.980
And you know what a stand it looks like a split

363
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:52.270
<v 3>works together.
He looks like he's got,
you know,
decent striking.</v>

364
00:20:52.271 --> 00:20:55.750
It looks like he knows how to move on his feet and uh,

365
00:20:55.751 --> 00:20:59.110
he's been at Tristar so you know,
it's working as rustling all the Goddamn time.

366
00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:04.770
Is his wrestling going to be good enough to take anybody down in the top 10?

367
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:09.130
Wayne,
what is it competing at one 45 and he's going to stay there?

368
00:21:09.131 --> 00:21:11.500
Or is it going to go to 35 I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.

369
00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.080
A lot of times they do tough at a weight class above,

370
00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:17.650
I think because if you're gonna make the extreme weight cut that a lot of guys

371
00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:20.620
make,
you're going to need six to eight weeks.
Whereas if you're on tough,

372
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:23.320
you got to do it multiple times over the course of six weeks.

373
00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:26.920
And for a lot of dudes,
like almost everybody started out a higher weight class.

374
00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:29.321
Michael Bisping,

375
00:21:29.321 --> 00:21:32.470
you know he competed at two Oh five and beat a lot of guys at two oh five he

376
00:21:32.471 --> 00:21:36.460
fought on the ultimate fighter to a five one 85 is a better way class for him.

377
00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:41.360
Yeah,
same with Calvin.
Calvin wanted at one 85 but he's better at one 70 yeah.

378
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:43.900
It's almost like if you're going to do the ultimate fighter,

379
00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:47.070
you do your walk around,
wait,
do your set.

380
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:49.870
Like if you had to do something same day,
weigh in,
do that way.

381
00:21:49.871 --> 00:21:53.080
That's always the next weight category and that she wanted to get super crazy.

382
00:21:53.081 --> 00:21:54.190
Some guys just say fuck it.

383
00:21:54.191 --> 00:21:56.800
Same Day when I'm still going to cut like a motherfucker.

384
00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.740
I just think when you're on that show and you going to do that several times

385
00:21:59.741 --> 00:22:03.520
over six weeks and then on top of that,
it's the nerves and all the TV cameras.

386
00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.820
Your first experience,
you better off just not being,

387
00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:10.580
not doing anything that's gonna Drain you.
He might go to 35.
I mean,
I,

388
00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:15.780
I mean how does he look at 45 he's kind of like a skinny winery guy at 45 right

389
00:22:15.791 --> 00:22:18.010
now.
So far in the house.
I think he has,

390
00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:22.040
he had one fight and he had a fight to get in.
Uh,

391
00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.250
so far with just those two fights.

392
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:28.240
He's already world renown leg lock.

393
00:22:28.241 --> 00:22:31.260
Master Uriah on the show.
You want you to shadow?

394
00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:35.600
I haven't seen the season at all,
dude.
Come on.
I got to record it and watch.

395
00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:40.910
I binge-watch tough with Conor McGregor.
Holy motherfucking shit.
How good at it.

396
00:22:40.911 --> 00:22:43.690
But it's like the best ever.
Are you kidding?

397
00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:48.550
That's the best motherfucking puff of all time.
That's the best one.

398
00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:52.630
How are you going to get better than Conor McGregor on your Goddamn TV show that

399
00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:57.190
a fight show.
Oh Man.
He gets under your eyes.
Scan all.

400
00:22:57.191 --> 00:23:01.110
He starts a lot of Shit,
man.
He's the ultimate shit talk.

401
00:23:01.111 --> 00:23:05.080
Isn't it fucked up that he called Tj Dillashaw snake in the grass and they wind

402
00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:09.430
up leaving.
That's crazy.
That's some profit shit.

403
00:23:09.431 --> 00:23:12.520
That's some old Celtic warrior shit.
Mcgregor.

404
00:23:12.521 --> 00:23:16.240
Just calling it like he just figures if he just calls it like he sees it.
Yeah,

405
00:23:16.241 --> 00:23:19.840
no,
no filter.
Just call it like you see it.
Don't hold it in just no editing.

406
00:23:19.841 --> 00:23:22.660
Just let it all.
He's,
he's from Dublin like they,

407
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:27.490
they talk mad shit over there dude.
It's a totally different style of shit.

408
00:23:27.491 --> 00:23:28.510
Ton of the ultimate,

409
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:33.630
the ultimate tough would be chail coaching one team and Mcgon or coaching

410
00:23:34.901 --> 00:23:37.400
another team and their weight.
They're different weight classes.

411
00:23:37.401 --> 00:23:41.410
It's like chill could walk around at two 30 you know,
if he's not fighting,

412
00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:46.520
he's way bigger than Connor.
So,
but so alpha,

413
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.760
he's not going to jail is going to like,

414
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:51.590
like big brother him and go oh come on at first like come on,
come on,

415
00:23:51.591 --> 00:23:53.960
you're too small for me.
Chair would find a workaround.

416
00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:57.920
The would figure out an unorthodox approach to dealing with Co.
He would,

417
00:23:57.921 --> 00:24:00.770
he would deal like,
listen,
you're,
you're 160 pounds,

418
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:02.950
160 cute fella here.

419
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:06.770
And then the [inaudible] going to take that Connor is not going to sit there and

420
00:24:06.771 --> 00:24:09.740
be the little one 60 pound.
You know,

421
00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:12.290
a tiny little fighter to jail.

422
00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:15.500
He's not going to big brother and I think he's bigger than one 60 I really do.

423
00:24:15.501 --> 00:24:16.670
It's like one seven year,
whatever,

424
00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:20.000
which is crazy that he fights at one 45 think about the shit talking between

425
00:24:20.001 --> 00:24:24.410
them to hold credible,
you'd have to get chill off of his suspension.

426
00:24:24.411 --> 00:24:25.700
He's got a two year suspension,

427
00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:28.580
then c and then kind of went after agree to fight them in a catch weight and

428
00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.120
it'll end up being condo.

429
00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:35.220
Let's meet at one 80 if you can get down to one 81 85 or maybe Connor just says,

430
00:24:36.171 --> 00:24:41.000
fuck it,
we're going to fight free weight.
Absolute Bitch.
Well,
I mean,

431
00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.100
Connor and Rye aren't fighting.

432
00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:45.930
I mean the show's hilarious and they're not fighting.

433
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:49.280
The coaches don't need to compete against each other at the end for it to be

434
00:24:49.281 --> 00:24:52.280
good.
Yeah,
exactly.
Exactly.
I don't need that.

435
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:55.100
That would just happen because ICAN ICAN or wouldn't be able to take a kind of,

436
00:24:55.101 --> 00:24:57.890
would call him out and say,
let's do this shit.
You know?
It'd be interesting.

437
00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:00.260
It'd be interesting to see someone,

438
00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:04.460
a coach opposite Ronda,
like a dude,

439
00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.430
a dude coach opposite are raw Connor and Rhonda.

440
00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:14.900
Rhonda to try would crush a ratings that would break the fucking take it.

441
00:25:14.931 --> 00:25:16.670
That would be the greatest ratings of all time.

442
00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:20.150
There would be no greater Connor and Rhonda together on a show.

443
00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:24.320
And what if they wound up having an affair?
Oh,
it'd be giant news.

444
00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:27.020
Dana probably would probably pull them aside.
Give him some ecstasy.

445
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:31.320
You guys want to make,
you want to make a lot of money.
You want matching

446
00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:35.053
like

447
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:42.330
Angelina Jollie there I,
yeah,
them fucking so,
yeah,

448
00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:46.940
I'm a loping together.
It'd be so similar.
That's a Larry exact same thing.

449
00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.370
It would be the exact same motherfucking thing.

450
00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:53.990
He's the real fight club and she's the number one check on the planet.
Who's,

451
00:25:53.991 --> 00:25:58.130
who has more power than Angelina Jolie.
She can go to any goddamn country easily.

452
00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:01.320
She wants to go go meet the president of fucking Uganda.
Oh,

453
00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:06.320
she didn't make that happen.
Oh yeah.
Fuck he's gonna.

454
00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:11.420
He's gonna send a private jet for,
well,
she's become like an ambassador for like,

455
00:26:11.421 --> 00:26:15.890
it's not just going to get into anybody's house just to an actress.

456
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:20.630
She does so much humanitarian work.
She adopt.
How many kids?
Isn't that awesome?

457
00:26:20.631 --> 00:26:22.310
It's amazing what they do.
I mean,

458
00:26:22.311 --> 00:26:26.000
a lot of people trivial off trivialize it because we always have suspect
motives.

459
00:26:26.001 --> 00:26:28.870
We always suspect like,
oh,
they're just doing it for the publicity.
Ah,

460
00:26:28.871 --> 00:26:31.970
they're just,
she's just fucking crazy.
But at the end of the day,

461
00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:36.320
she's adopting a bunch people and spending a bunch of time working to help all

462
00:26:36.321 --> 00:26:40.790
these sick,
needy and poor people.
I mean,
she does some pretty incredible shit,

463
00:26:40.791 --> 00:26:43.710
man.
That's a lot of positive energy.
I mean,

464
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:49.320
<v 2>it's,
uh,
it's probably why he or she's had the most amazing career ever.</v>

465
00:26:49.321 --> 00:26:52.170
I mean,
she's hot and everything,
but there's a lot of hot chicks out there.
She's,

466
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:56.550
she remains relevant because of all that philanthropy was like,
she wouldn't be,

467
00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:01.530
she wouldn't be doing all that she's doing if she didn't appreciate life way

468
00:27:01.531 --> 00:27:06.300
more than the average person.
So she's living in a state of appreciation so much.

469
00:27:06.301 --> 00:27:09.540
He's been wanting to give back so much and change the world.

470
00:27:09.541 --> 00:27:14.541
She's so into it and that's just like a overproduction of appreciation and then

471
00:27:14.671 --> 00:27:17.730
look at a career and then she comes out with,
she's,

472
00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:21.930
she's a list all the way through.
Not only that,
even if her movies suck,

473
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:24.270
people just forget about them.
They just don't talk about him anymore.

474
00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:25.920
Like Angelina Jolie socks.

475
00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:30.810
But if they were going to do like a alien six with Angelina Jolie,
you'd be like,

476
00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.840
Oh shit and Joel,
he's going to be in the alien movie.

477
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.230
Like you would never think like,
oh,
this is how bad the cast is.

478
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:41.670
She's done like that.
A Cinderella type movie.

479
00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:46.140
It's kind of like a Disney super animated Cruella.
Right.
Something like that.

480
00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.710
I don't know how big that was.
Maybe that Dell has got 100 million or something.

481
00:27:49.711 --> 00:27:54.330
It was big.
It was big for kids.
Perfect for her.
Yeah,
she could do anything.

482
00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:58.290
I mean like movie star Wise,
any,
any role that she really wants to pursue,

483
00:27:58.291 --> 00:28:00.300
she could do for now.
You know,

484
00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:03.000
as she gets into her forties there'll be harder and harder.

485
00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:04.410
That's what it is for those women,

486
00:28:04.411 --> 00:28:08.310
like those Meryl Streep type women who were just smashing it in the 80s just

487
00:28:08.311 --> 00:28:12.120
killing it.
She's such a good actress.
God Damn,
she's good.
She's so believable.

488
00:28:12.121 --> 00:28:12.954
It's just so,

489
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:17.730
but as they get like in their fifties and their sixties it's hard to find roles.

490
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:20.160
There's not a lot of movies made about 60 year old ladies,

491
00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:24.480
you know like so you have like a support role that may or may not be juicy and

492
00:28:24.481 --> 00:28:28.110
might be boring.
My mom,
once you start playing the moms,

493
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:31.940
well that was one of the things that Robin Williams was saying Rob Williams was

494
00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:35.730
saying before he died that it was really getting really hard for him because the

495
00:28:35.731 --> 00:28:38.280
only thing that he was being offered that were interesting at all,

496
00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:42.330
we're like scale or sometimes not even scale,
like you have to do it for free.

497
00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:47.270
No Way.
She's still cute.

498
00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:50.160
He was.
He was,
but the things that he found interesting,

499
00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:53.370
he would do these movies that were just,
they didn't have any money.

500
00:28:53.371 --> 00:28:54.091
They didn't have any budget,

501
00:28:54.091 --> 00:28:58.200
but those were the interesting like did you ever see that 24 hour film for 24

502
00:28:58.201 --> 00:28:59.490
hour photo?
What was it called?

503
00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.180
It was called 24 hour photo or something like that.
He played a psycho,

504
00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:05.960
like a real cycle that likes startups.
Family.
Yeah.

505
00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:09.150
It was that his last fucking cause that was last film.
No,
no,
no,
no.

506
00:29:09.151 --> 00:29:10.230
There was a few years ago,

507
00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:13.980
but he started getting interested in doing these like small independent films

508
00:29:13.981 --> 00:29:15.030
like that and you know,

509
00:29:15.031 --> 00:29:17.910
they would offer him like a piece of the backend or something like that
probably.

510
00:29:17.911 --> 00:29:19.620
But he had a huge nut.

511
00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:24.120
He had a giant ass house up in like northern California one hour photo.

512
00:29:24.121 --> 00:29:27.240
That's what it was.
Dude,
he was so good in that movie.
God Damn it.

513
00:29:27.241 --> 00:29:30.180
You would never believe that he's a Holly.
You never believed that.

514
00:29:30.181 --> 00:29:34.710
The same guy from Mork and Mindy would be this fucking creeper in one hour
photo.

515
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:39.790
He was awesome in it.
But um,
my point being he had um,

516
00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:42.460
like a,
a state in northern California.

517
00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:44.140
<v 4>Those are worth like 20 million bucks.</v>

518
00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:49.380
He had like all these bills following his heart with these roles.

519
00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:52.510
Crushed him.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

520
00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:56.050
He had some serious physical issues.
You know,

521
00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:00.520
he committed suicide for whatever reason,
only he knows,

522
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.550
but there was a lot going on.
He had Parkinson's disease.

523
00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:08.480
He had some sort of dementia that apparently was coming on his,

524
00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:11.470
his mind wasn't functioning very well.
His body was failing.

525
00:30:11.471 --> 00:30:14.350
He had a massive heart attack.
He had a massive heart attack.

526
00:30:14.351 --> 00:30:19.030
And then in going through a heart surgery,
a doctor,
Mark Gordon,

527
00:30:19.031 --> 00:30:22.120
you met Dr. Gordon,
right?
And your mother,
I'm a,
I dunno,
uh,

528
00:30:22.121 --> 00:30:24.970
he's the one that does all the work with traumatic brain injury patients.

529
00:30:24.971 --> 00:30:29.971
And he said that when people go through any type of a giant surgery like that,

530
00:30:30.101 --> 00:30:33.220
like heart surgery,
well,
you have to be under for a long period of time.

531
00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:37.280
A lot of times your hormonal system is devastated.
After that.
You're,

532
00:30:37.281 --> 00:30:41.740
your body's like really fucked up and it can send you into a depression like the

533
00:30:41.741 --> 00:30:46.420
recovery from a major like heart surgery,

534
00:30:46.421 --> 00:30:47.140
like w what he,

535
00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:50.830
what he had done is apparently like it's a devastating thing on your body,

536
00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:52.780
takes a long time to recover from.

537
00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:57.670
And in that recovery process he thinks that a lot of patients suffer from

538
00:30:57.671 --> 00:31:02.350
massive depression and there's like a correlation between suicide attempts post

539
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:07.710
surgery that he thinks possibly could be attributed to devastating effect that

540
00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.290
being under for a long period of times and then the trauma of the surgery can

541
00:31:11.291 --> 00:31:14.800
have on you.
So he had a lot going that was wrong before he killed himself.

542
00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:19.420
All the energy,
this is just me guessing this is like a bro Biology,

543
00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:20.623
but I'm guessing

544
00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:24.790
when you're going through something like that and you're about to die and gone

545
00:31:24.791 --> 00:31:27.310
through some major surgery,
your body's like,

546
00:31:27.311 --> 00:31:30.160
we're not thinking about being happy at all.

547
00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:34.690
Right now we're thinking about being alive so it stops all Saratonin production

548
00:31:34.691 --> 00:31:39.160
just to keep you alive and when you recover your shit is so depleted that maybe

549
00:31:39.161 --> 00:31:42.340
that's why you're depressed.
That's me guessing.
It could be.

550
00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:46.510
It's also could just be,
it's a massive strain on the system.
You know,

551
00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:51.810
I saw one of the reasons why they would prescribe steroids after surgery is they

552
00:31:52.901 --> 00:31:55.630
would prescribe it,
especially to athletes when they get injured,

553
00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:59.320
not just to make them recover quickly,
but because during that recovery process,

554
00:31:59.321 --> 00:32:01.570
your body's very weak.
Like when you're,

555
00:32:01.571 --> 00:32:03.610
when you have some major shit going on with your body,

556
00:32:03.611 --> 00:32:07.000
you have some major shit fixed like for the x amount of weeks afterwards,

557
00:32:07.001 --> 00:32:10.570
depending upon how old you are and how healthy you are,

558
00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:14.230
you feel wrecked.
You just feel wrecked.
It just like,

559
00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:18.490
oh cause your body's like danger,
danger,
resources.
Dude,

560
00:32:18.491 --> 00:32:23.050
we got screws in our fucking knee.
We have a a,
there's an incision,

561
00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:26.740
there's stitches,
is screws in the Patella and in the bottom,

562
00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:28.270
this is crazy.

563
00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:32.110
He cut off piece of our a Patella tendon and stuffed it inside with the ACL.

564
00:32:32.111 --> 00:32:33.460
Used to be,
there's no ACL.

565
00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:38.140
All this inflammation like your body's on just like crash alert.

566
00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:43.160
Your body knows some pretty devastating severe shit has happened to it.

567
00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:47.570
So,
uh,
I think depending on,
upon how healthy you are,
it's,

568
00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:49.910
it can be a rough times afterwards.

569
00:32:49.911 --> 00:32:54.290
And I think for an older dude like him who already has these physical issues,

570
00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:58.310
I dunno if Parkinson's happened before or if he had had the symptoms,

571
00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:03.380
how did he kill himself again?
Johann themselves.
Damn.
Damn.

572
00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:05.720
Yeah,
man.
Is that,

573
00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:09.980
<v 0>uh,
common quick way to go and suicide people do that.</v>

574
00:33:09.981 --> 00:33:11.620
They want to suffer a little bit.
They do have,

575
00:33:11.621 --> 00:33:13.250
they don't want to shoot themselves or they don't,

576
00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:15.590
or they don't want to suffer from pills.
You know,

577
00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:18.540
<v 4>there's only a few ways to go.
Hmm.
Um,</v>

578
00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:22.230
California actually just passed a law for assisted suicide,

579
00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:25.560
which is going to be interesting.
I don't know the particular details of the law,

580
00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.110
but,
uh,
when people are terminally ill,

581
00:33:28.111 --> 00:33:31.350
like if you're dying of cancer or something like that and you're just in agony

582
00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:33.310
every day,
um,

583
00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:38.130
now finally you can end your own life and you can have doctor assisted suicide.

584
00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:38.671
You know,

585
00:33:38.671 --> 00:33:42.780
they'd been doing it to people either on the sneak tip or you people have had to

586
00:33:42.781 --> 00:33:45.330
go to states where it's legal.
Like I believe it's legal in Oregon,

587
00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:50.530
but now it's going to be legal here too.
It's amazing that you can't,
you,

588
00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:54.360
you have to
eventually everyone has to think about shit.

589
00:33:54.361 --> 00:33:58.050
Like put the dog down.
Okay.
Your dogs and agony,
you put your dog down.

590
00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:58.913
But not grandpa.

591
00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:02.700
GRANDPA's got a suffer grandpa's got to just keep shitting his pants and

592
00:34:02.701 --> 00:34:05.550
throwing up and falling down and breaking all his bones and then stitch them

593
00:34:05.551 --> 00:34:08.820
back together again and give him some pills.
And if grandpa was a dog,

594
00:34:08.821 --> 00:34:12.810
you would've to put grandpa out a long time ago.
You know,
if Grandpa says,
look,

595
00:34:12.811 --> 00:34:17.280
I'm ready to go.
You bring in the doctor,
the doctor.
Are you of sound mind?
Yes.

596
00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:21.090
You know,
I'm 95 years old.
I had a great life.
I have wonderful family round.

597
00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:24.030
I'd like to be around when I pass and that's it.

598
00:34:26.910 --> 00:34:29.700
And you go,
which is probably a good way to go,
man.

599
00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:32.660
It's probably a good way to go.
I think,
um,

600
00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:35.790
the idea that you're supposed to suffer and make it to the end because it's

601
00:34:35.791 --> 00:34:40.200
natural.
Well that,
that's not how we treat our cats.
You know,

602
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:42.870
if your cat is in fucking agony,
man,
you put your cat down,

603
00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:45.990
he dog gets hit by a car and he's not going to make it and he's just howling.

604
00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:47.070
You put your dog down.

605
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.600
This idea that people have to make it to some fucking finish line

606
00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:58.380
darkness,
it is dark darkness,
brace that darkness.

607
00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:03.150
Um,
those are the documents makes you appreciate the light,
you know,

608
00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:05.340
that kind of shit and it makes you appreciate the light.

609
00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:06.671
<v 0>Yeah,
man.</v>

610
00:35:06.671 --> 00:35:10.990
It's like we're all going to have to deal with that sooner or later or you die

611
00:35:10.991 --> 00:35:13.030
early.
I know one of the one or the other,

612
00:35:13.031 --> 00:35:16.810
you're going to go through that old age and the hospital falling apart.

613
00:35:16.811 --> 00:35:17.950
People taking care of you.

614
00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:21.820
Everybody's going to go to that or you're going to die before that.
Yeah.

615
00:35:21.821 --> 00:35:25.330
One of the other,
um,
my friend from Boston just died.

616
00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.480
My boss when I was starting out too in standup comedy,

617
00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:32.980
I stayed friends with him from a,
for the past 26 years,
has,

618
00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:37.990
his name's Dave Dolan.
He was a private investigator.
And He,
uh,
he needed a,
um,

619
00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:43.230
needed a driver because he lost his license with the Dui.
And he said,

620
00:35:43.231 --> 00:35:44.640
fuck it,
I'm quitting drinking.
That's it.

621
00:35:44.641 --> 00:35:46.350
But I need a driver cause he still had to work.

622
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:51.180
So we put an ad out in the want ads for a private investigators assistant.

623
00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:56.280
And I,
uh,
answered the ad and I met this dude and he was fucking hilarious.

624
00:35:56.281 --> 00:35:57.750
It was mostly insurance cases.

625
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.840
Occasionally it would be like a guy who thinks his wife cheating on him,

626
00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:04.860
but most of it was insurance cases where people would pretend to be injured and

627
00:36:04.861 --> 00:36:06.480
they would get,
they would get another job,

628
00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:10.290
like working for cash under the table and he'd catch them because like the

629
00:36:10.291 --> 00:36:13.110
insurance company was paying them millions of dollars or whatever they were

630
00:36:13.111 --> 00:36:15.990
paying them and then they would go get another job.
Probably not millions,

631
00:36:15.991 --> 00:36:20.700
you know,
um,
maybe there were suing,
whatever it was.
Most of these people,

632
00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:22.890
they would get up early in the morning and go work other jobs.

633
00:36:22.891 --> 00:36:27.150
So we would just wait.
So we would drive to this location,
go up the street.

634
00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:30.530
So our car would be facing that house and we shut the car off and wait,

635
00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:33.180
we get there at four o'clock in the morning,

636
00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:35.790
but you're sitting there at four o'clock in the morning waiting for this dude

637
00:36:35.791 --> 00:36:39.540
wake up and you should start talking shit.
And he would just talk shit.

638
00:36:39.541 --> 00:36:43.680
He was hilarious.
Who would talk Shit Dave,
this Guy Day?
Yeah,

639
00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:46.050
he was the one of the funniest people I've ever met in my life.

640
00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:50.910
Like how old were you at this time?
I was 21 and you were just starting stand up.

641
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.100
I was just doing an open mic nights and I was still fighting.

642
00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:57.660
He was on the last guy to see me fight and um,
he,
uh,

643
00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:00.600
he would just talk shit,
talk shit about like,

644
00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:05.690
he was one of those guys that like women could never ever get him to change.

645
00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:10.740
Like it was impossible.
Like there was no,
there was no like,

646
00:37:10.741 --> 00:37:14.590
what should I do?
Man,
she wants me to,
she wants me to change.

647
00:37:14.591 --> 00:37:16.160
She wants me to change the way I'm dressing.

648
00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:18.530
She wants me to move into some new neighborhood.

649
00:37:18.531 --> 00:37:21.450
She wants me to quit my job and you know,
maybe I'm going to convert,

650
00:37:21.451 --> 00:37:23.550
become Jewish.
There was none of that and that dude,

651
00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:27.810
none from the moment I met him,
he was like,
fuck that.
You do that.

652
00:37:27.811 --> 00:37:30.510
That's the beginning of the end pal.
Well listen,
that's how they get ya.

653
00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.980
And he would always used to be laughing like never.
I don't,

654
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.720
I don't believe he was ever married.
They might've been.
But even if he was,

655
00:37:36.721 --> 00:37:39.810
I'm sure that check had zero control over that guy.
Like I was crazy.

656
00:37:39.811 --> 00:37:40.860
He was hilarious.

657
00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:44.430
He was a guy that was meant to be a comedian that never became a comedian.

658
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:48.990
100% it could have been a worldclass comedian.
He was fucking funny.

659
00:37:48.991 --> 00:37:53.700
And he was insightful.
And his cousin actually owned the comedy connection.

660
00:37:53.701 --> 00:37:57.000
His cousin was built down,
so it was one of the owners of the comedy connection.

661
00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:00.480
So I didn't even know this when I started working for him and he's asking me,

662
00:38:00.481 --> 00:38:04.500
you know,
what do you do?
And a,
and I told him the whole deal and he was like,

663
00:38:04.501 --> 00:38:08.160
my cousins Billy down.
So I'm like,
I do open mic nights there.
He's like,
no shit.

664
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:13.060
And so he easily like if he just decided to go and do it,

665
00:38:13.061 --> 00:38:15.300
he just never did it.
He easily could have been a comedian.

666
00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:18.660
He was fucking hilarious.
And we would do these things,

667
00:38:18.661 --> 00:38:21.730
we would show up at people's houses and he would have like a list of license

668
00:38:21.731 --> 00:38:24.720
plates.
And on one of those,
one of those license plates would be the,

669
00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:26.760
the license plate of the person that we're looking at.

670
00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:29.640
The other ones would be scratched out and maybe a couple more,

671
00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:33.920
they just write a few in and get to this one.
And he would say,
listen,

672
00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:36.010
my girl was in a hit and run and

673
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:37.030
<v 2>this,
uh,
this guy,</v>

674
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:41.830
he took off but someone got the plate and they didn't get it all,

675
00:38:41.831 --> 00:38:45.190
but they got this amount of it,
you know,
you know,
and the guy was like,
well,

676
00:38:45.191 --> 00:38:49.210
that definitely wasn't me.
Hey,
whoa.
Wow.
I'm so sorry to hear that.
Is She okay?

677
00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:51.560
I go,
well,
she's going to be all right,
but she's got a,

678
00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:56.470
a bulging disc and her l seven,
which is exactly what this guy's injury was and,

679
00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:00.490
and the person would go,
that's crazy.
I have that same injury.
Oh,
no kidding.
Huh?

680
00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:04.660
Well,
uh,
you,
you,
you,
you get into compensation and it got to be,
yeah,

681
00:39:04.661 --> 00:39:07.090
you're getting paid and all.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's great.
That payment,

682
00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:10.330
and I'm also working under another name.
Like they would just tell you,
like,

683
00:39:10.331 --> 00:39:12.430
this woman just told us that very story.

684
00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:14.290
She told us she was working under her maiden name.

685
00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:15.700
Then she had the same time for coffee.

686
00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:19.390
This is how crazy people were in 1988 they have you in their fucking house for

687
00:39:19.391 --> 00:39:23.860
coffee.
We didn't know this lady.
It was two men,
two men.
I mean me,

688
00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:27.490
I was 21 and he,
he,
he was probably like 31 32 at the time.

689
00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:30.670
And he had a center her fucking house and drink coffee with us.

690
00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:34.330
And Dave's asking her,
so how do you work that?
And she's telling him,
you know,

691
00:39:34.331 --> 00:39:37.600
I'll,
well you talked to choose my maiden name,
like,
so what happened?

692
00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:42.480
He had tape recording.
No,
no,
he's just listening.
Just listening.
So he goes up.

693
00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:45.790
So did you get hurt or he just bullshit the whole thing.
She'll,

694
00:39:45.791 --> 00:39:48.380
how am I gonna hurt a little bit,
but I was fine.
So does that,

695
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:51.790
went to the doctor and the doctor looked at me like he gave up the whole
fucking,

696
00:39:51.791 --> 00:39:54.340
she gave up the whole story and then we left.
I was like,
God,

697
00:39:54.341 --> 00:39:59.230
I feel so bad we can't rat her out.
She was so nice.
He goes,
fuck her.
She goes,

698
00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:01.390
she goes far car.

699
00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:05.930
And I felt,

700
00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:10.170
I felt terrible because this lady was so nice and she let us in on her scam and

701
00:40:10.171 --> 00:40:13.840
I fuck her.
She's a fucking scammer.
Fuck her.

702
00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:19.740
He would never ever show any sympathy for those people that will like scam an

703
00:40:19.741 --> 00:40:22.660
insurance.
He's like,
that's what the,
that was the game.
It was like,
ah,

704
00:40:22.661 --> 00:40:25.500
I'm the sheep dog.
You're the coyote.
I'm going to Jack you.

705
00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:28.120
It's like that cartoon where they would go,
you wouldn't follow them.

706
00:40:28.121 --> 00:40:32.020
You would just see him walking and then go up to them?
Totally depends.

707
00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:34.030
Sometimes we would actually show up at the job site.

708
00:40:34.031 --> 00:40:37.340
We catch a guy like on a roof with a fucking bag shingles on his,
on his bag,

709
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:43.180
just it just find out where the guy is,
find out what we'd take photos.

710
00:40:43.181 --> 00:40:47.160
He had a camera,
take photos of the guy and go,
look,
this guy's working and that,

711
00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:49.450
and then the would they usually it would happen,

712
00:40:49.451 --> 00:40:53.110
I believe the way they would work at as an insurance company with threatened the

713
00:40:53.111 --> 00:40:58.060
person and would say they're going to have him arrested for forgery and Fraud

714
00:40:58.060 --> 00:40:58.390
Fraud Rather.

715
00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:01.150
And then the person would either settle or they would maybe have to pay some of

716
00:41:01.151 --> 00:41:02.760
the money back and they would just,

717
00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:06.220
the insurance company just knew they're being scammed and they didn't want to.

718
00:41:06.221 --> 00:41:09.880
Uh,
did you ever have to fucking anybody?
I'm no,
no,
no.
Nothing ever got ugly.

719
00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:11.230
Nothing even got Yeley.

720
00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:15.790
It was day 88 80 fucken eight.
Yeah.

721
00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:19.940
Dave was like real good at talking to people.
He was like a,
he was a man,

722
00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:25.050
but he loved it.
He loved the scam and people,
he loved it.
He just loved it.

723
00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:26.500
So you're getting paid though,
aren't ya?

724
00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:30.700
Like he would love like baiting them in and getting them to talk about it and

725
00:41:30.701 --> 00:41:33.980
he'd get in the car and started laughing.
Ha ha ha.
That fucking dummy.
He

726
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:38.960
<v 0>gave us everything.
Ah,
look at these photos.
Perfect.
He goes,
fuck.
He goes,</v>

727
00:41:38.961 --> 00:41:43.190
he goes,
fuck him.
How Joey to him,
that would be a row.

728
00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:47.640
I'd have to think about that.
I don't know man,
let me,

729
00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.710
but he just died of cancer.

730
00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:54.510
Just died of cancer last week real quick.
Apparently.
I just,

731
00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:57.570
I just started getting some emails and messages about it and I was like,

732
00:41:57.571 --> 00:42:00.480
no way and things.
The last time we talked to him,

733
00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:03.210
last time I was in Boston just a few months ago and I was,

734
00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:06.420
I'm going back to Boston in January and I was just going to get them tickets to

735
00:42:06.421 --> 00:42:08.220
the fights and I was hoping,
uh,
you know,

736
00:42:08.221 --> 00:42:10.020
have some dinner with them or something and hang out with them.

737
00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:14.640
But we stayed friends.
We stayed friends all this time.

738
00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:19.330
He was a good dude,
man.
He still stayed,
became,
you know,

739
00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:22.860
stayed being a private investigator every now and then would call me up with

740
00:42:22.861 --> 00:42:25.230
some crazy fucking story,
some crazy story.

741
00:42:25.231 --> 00:42:29.390
One of them was this guy whose girlfriend was getting fucked by this
bodybuilder.

742
00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:33.330
He,
she was,
uh,
she was meeting this gorilla who is just,

743
00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:37.080
just bragged on or just,
just fucking savage fucking her.

744
00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:41.410
And this guy kept wanting to get her followed.
Like the one guy,

745
00:42:41.411 --> 00:42:42.600
the guy was like a real nerdy guys,

746
00:42:42.601 --> 00:42:45.260
like computer guy and his girlfriend was just,
just,

747
00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:48.930
just getting mauled all the time by this dude.
And he suspected it.

748
00:42:48.931 --> 00:42:51.420
So we hired a private investigator and then David's like,
dude,

749
00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:55.920
I can't keep taking pictures of your girl getting fucked by this giant guy.

750
00:42:55.921 --> 00:43:00.060
It's starting to get creepy.
So,
uh,
we're done here,

751
00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:05.720
but him telling him,
this guy's like,
oh,
go follow her.

752
00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:08.610
And it was following tomorrow.
Are you looking at the pictures?

753
00:43:08.611 --> 00:43:13.611
I'm looking at it because he would like take pictures of this guy just stopping.

754
00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:19.500
He probably loves pictures.
Oh,
I bet he did.
Well,
he's probably a cuckold,

755
00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:22.720
you know,
like that's what they say.
That's like a whole style porn now.

756
00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:26.860
It's like a guy,
it's usually like black eyes,
like a white guy.
He's a nerd.

757
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:31.130
He's like,
yeah,
sure.
Come on in.
Like,
Oh man,
does your wife.
Oh Shit.

758
00:43:31.131 --> 00:43:34.130
How is your wife was this hot?
Oh,
she has my wife.

759
00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:39.050
I'm not sure if I want you talking about her like that.
Talk about fucker.

760
00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:43.040
Bitch wants my Dick.
Oh,
she won't this Dick Bitch.
They look,
oh,

761
00:43:43.041 --> 00:43:45.110
she's sucking my Dick Right in front of you.

762
00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:49.070
There's a horn and there's an odd man.

763
00:43:49.071 --> 00:43:52.790
There's all these old like husbands and she's like a feeble guy.

764
00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:57.800
A feeble guy and a black eye.
Fucking shooting black guys.
No,
no,
no,
no.

765
00:43:57.801 --> 00:44:02.000
The Guy,
I'm sure this,
that was the white.
Yeah.

766
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:05.750
Most of the time the wife getting abused.
The husband never fucks as well.

767
00:44:05.751 --> 00:44:07.280
I'm sure there's some of the husband fucks too.

768
00:44:07.281 --> 00:44:08.730
I'm sure to some of the husband fun.

769
00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:11.300
I'm sure that some of the hospital has the sucks guys deck,

770
00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:14.690
like maybe the wife fucks the,
maybe the,
maybe the husband.

771
00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:19.130
This is the ultimate car called the husband.
That's his hit there.

772
00:44:19.131 --> 00:44:22.700
Why this giant fucking super athlete Fox,

773
00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:25.580
his girl and then when the guy comes,
he comes in the husband's mouth.

774
00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:29.720
It's the ultimate one.
It's the only time the husband sucks the guy's Dick,

775
00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:31.770
but as he could get over here,
get your hair over here.

776
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:34.950
He puts the guy's head right down on the wife,

777
00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:39.720
the wife's stomach while he just fucking plowing it and then he pulls it out and

778
00:44:39.721 --> 00:44:40.740
stuffs it in the dude's mouth.

779
00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:44.610
Right now someone's writing this down and then making this video probably

780
00:44:44.611 --> 00:44:48.460
shooting it this week,
dude on Twitter sending me links it all right and exist.

781
00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:52.610
The whole trilogy,
that's,
that's actually quite normal.

782
00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:56.370
[inaudible] website.
Oh,
come on.
The husband's mouth.com you never been,

783
00:44:56.910 --> 00:45:01.140
you don't even know that website,
Bro.
Yeah.
Whenever you can think of man,

784
00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:04.920
when,
when we were first,
when you were first exposed to porn,

785
00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:08.010
I was exposed like in high school.
That's when I first found out about porn.

786
00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:09.810
It was also normal.

787
00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:12.900
It was just the worst thing that would happen is two people get together and

788
00:45:12.901 --> 00:45:15.450
they'd have sex.
That was it.
There's all that ever happened,

789
00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:19.800
but then somewhere around the time,
like we were in Ife,
Germans

790
00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:26.220
and the Japanese,
you mean Shit Porn.
That's not even porn.
That's just,

791
00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:27.960
that's just fucking weird.

792
00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:33.170
But even just regular porn became more about like gagging and fucking gagging.

793
00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:39.120
Yeah.
Girls all do.
Even when they suck dick now it's like they're,

794
00:45:39.121 --> 00:45:41.130
they're doing it like they're trying to kill themselves.

795
00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:45.960
Is that the new commit suicide?
I didn't know that.
The gagging noises is good.

796
00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:49.440
There's a lot of that dude.
You've never seen a lot of that.

797
00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:55.100
It seems like people got bored with the regular stuff and then the got more and

798
00:45:55.101 --> 00:45:58.710
more
gag at me.

799
00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:01.830
Scream at me later and I'll make you gag too long.

800
00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:06.060
Hashtag Hashtag screaming at me later and I'll make you gag.

801
00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:08.730
Oh Man.

802
00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:12.960
Well I was talking about this the other day with Chris Ryan that like porn,

803
00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:17.880
like the look of the girl's vagina,
like shaved vaginas.
That's the only way now.

804
00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:22.170
Like there's very few bushes.
If a girl has a Bush these days,

805
00:46:22.171 --> 00:46:24.900
like she's taking a big chance.
She's being very eccentric.

806
00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:27.570
But back then it was all bushes.

807
00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:32.490
There was a point in time when I was like 22 that actually preferred a little

808
00:46:32.491 --> 00:46:37.290
Bush because when girls would shave it would blank burn.

809
00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:41.710
Like it would like Scaife my cock.
Oh we can know what I mean cause it's w yeah,

810
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:45.960
but when they left the kind of bushy,
it was all nice and squishy.
Phil player.

811
00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:50.490
Good point.
I was really into it.
So that girl had a little Bush.
I'm like,
damn,

812
00:46:50.491 --> 00:46:54.180
I'd like to squish into her some cross get all crazy lasered and shit.

813
00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:58.950
They do their legs,
their Pussy Bang laser.
That shit isn't that nuts man.

814
00:46:58.951 --> 00:47:02.440
That we use like a light beam.
We don't want hair on him.

815
00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:08.010
Are there cultures where a girls with hairy legs are hot?
Must Be.

816
00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:10.590
There's gotta be a couple of countries.
At least three.

817
00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:11.910
Well how about that country in Africa?

818
00:47:11.911 --> 00:47:15.900
Was it surgery where they cut their lips and they put plates in them and the

819
00:47:15.901 --> 00:47:20.070
bigger the plate,
the more cattle you're worth when you get married.
Know what

820
00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:26.670
fucking,
I want to know that story.
I want a document on how that happened.

821
00:47:26.671 --> 00:47:30.040
Like the evolution of that big plate on that lip.
Like when

822
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.890
<v 1>did it get cool?
Who brought it up?
Who is the,</v>

823
00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:37.840
who is the Helio Gracie of them lip fucking plates?
Who made that shit up?

824
00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:41.940
You know what I mean?
And there's gotta be a story,
Karen Chelation

825
00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:42.840
<v 0>that the way they did it,</v>

826
00:47:42.841 --> 00:47:47.240
they made the girls lip like that so that she wouldn't be attractive to a

827
00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:50.940
slave's slavers and people that were like trying to get slave.

828
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:55.120
<v 1>How did it get to that point know that'd be like everyone agreed on that.</v>

829
00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:56.830
Well don't allow

830
00:47:56.980 --> 00:48:01.980
<v 0>people that have like a lot of like metal in their face and shit and a lot of</v>

831
00:48:03.041 --> 00:48:06.700
people have crazy piercings in their cheeks and their nose,
their lips.
Don't.

832
00:48:06.701 --> 00:48:10.390
People usually say that that's a sign like,
and this is like,

833
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:13.620
this is total bro Psychology.
Right?
But that,

834
00:48:13.621 --> 00:48:15.340
that's a sign of people that have been abused.

835
00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:19.000
Isn't that like usually a sign of people that have had something like bad happen

836
00:48:19.001 --> 00:48:19.834
to them?

837
00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:20.130
<v 1>Right.</v>

838
00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:24.470
And going to like back in olden times before that was mental institutions like

839
00:48:24.471 --> 00:48:28.200
the crazy people of the village.
The town,
the big cities like them,
they can roam.

840
00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:29.060
All the crazy people,

841
00:48:29.061 --> 00:48:32.450
they just went out to the fucking jungle and started their own little culture

842
00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:35.150
and uh,
some of them are fucking nuts.

843
00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:42.230
Like who thought of the stories,
how the Romans get all the way to Africa.

844
00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:45.800
Did they ever meet vendor that platelet?
Yeah,
I think it was probably,

845
00:48:45.801 --> 00:48:46.500
I mean it makes sense

846
00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:48.470
<v 0>still if you look at like when you see,
okay,</v>

847
00:48:48.471 --> 00:48:50.630
if you see a girl with a bunch of shit in her face,

848
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:53.020
don't you immediately assume like,
ah,

849
00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:57.940
<v 1>girls probably molested.
Oh yeah,
yeah.
Right.
Whether or not that's fair or not,</v>

850
00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:01.750
just just being honest.
Totally,
totally not true.
It's probably totally not true,

851
00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:03.710
but you assume it.
Right.

852
00:49:03.850 --> 00:49:05.020
<v 0>Automatic because we,
we've,</v>

853
00:49:05.021 --> 00:49:07.390
we've developed a correlation between people that like,

854
00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:12.720
like girls with face tattoos or five eyebrow rings and a nose ring and two lip

855
00:49:13.211 --> 00:49:14.200
rings at a tongue ring.

856
00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:18.720
<v 1>Oh,
okay.
What's going on here?
There's definitely a,
the signs of the beast.</v>

857
00:49:18.730 --> 00:49:21.790
Like for me,
growing up with long hair,
that was a,

858
00:49:21.850 --> 00:49:23.370
I thought when I was growing up,
you know,

859
00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:26.620
my dad was never around and my stepdad didn't give a shit.
You know,

860
00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:29.560
I thought that doesn't affect me.
I'm too strong.

861
00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:33.940
1213 1516 that always thinking that never affected me.

862
00:49:33.941 --> 00:49:36.820
I didn't need no fucking dad.
It was always that way.
That didn't affect me.

863
00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:39.850
But when I look back at the pictures of my next big Mexican family,

864
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:42.940
there's all these normal looking people and then there's the dude.

865
00:49:42.941 --> 00:49:44.440
I got the wedding with the long hose,

866
00:49:44.441 --> 00:49:47.080
pissed off that he's there and not hanging out with his friends.

867
00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:50.710
It was always me pissed pictures like just like this.

868
00:49:50.711 --> 00:49:54.850
It was like normal for me to be like at the wedding at Dickinson Yetta at the

869
00:49:54.851 --> 00:49:56.860
big W,
whatever Shindig.

870
00:49:56.861 --> 00:50:00.880
Just pissed off that I'm not with my friends and playing music and listening to

871
00:50:00.881 --> 00:50:05.170
slayer and shit and I thought I wasn't affected.
I was so affected.

872
00:50:05.171 --> 00:50:07.980
I was a drummer in speed metal bands,
right.

873
00:50:07.981 --> 00:50:12.130
And Satanic lyrics and I thought I wasn't affected.
My hair was long.

874
00:50:12.131 --> 00:50:16.010
I was always in a pissed off mood like,
oh no,
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

875
00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:21.190
That's true.
I'm too strong for that shit.
My Dad,

876
00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:25.990
I didn't give a shit,
but damn he,
he damaged me.

877
00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:28.460
Of course those damage right there.
Shit.

878
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:30.450
<v 0>Every kid that doesn't get paid attention to,</v>

879
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:35.510
it's a core component of being a human being.
Like food,

880
00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:38.390
like water,
like being out in the sun.

881
00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:40.760
All those things are important for the development of a human being.

882
00:50:40.761 --> 00:50:45.200
Attention and love from your family.
So it makes you a loving person.

883
00:50:45.201 --> 00:50:48.890
Like you become loving when you're loved,
when you're not loved you,
you know,

884
00:50:48.891 --> 00:50:52.250
you in inward,
you get angry,
you get aggressive.
That's what happens to people.

885
00:50:52.251 --> 00:50:55.670
It's natural.
When you find people that are abused,
they're usually,

886
00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:59.420
a lot of times those people wind up being abusive themselves.
They lash out.

887
00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:02.660
You know?
I wonder if that is what happened with the Surrey women that that,

888
00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:06.740
that they were being taken as slaves and so they just started doing fucked up

889
00:51:06.741 --> 00:51:08.960
shit to their face to make themselves unattractive.

890
00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:12.460
<v 3>And they started their own little camp and then it turned into a village and</v>

891
00:51:12.461 --> 00:51:16.300
then blow.
It's a bunch of fucking crazy people started by like one crazy dude.

892
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:20.710
There's like the one dude is in those,
those,
those up piercing circus is,

893
00:51:20.711 --> 00:51:24.250
what do you call those things?
You know that's like a hearing services.
Oh yeah,

894
00:51:24.251 --> 00:51:26.680
I know what you're talking about.
Those crazy weird freak shows,

895
00:51:26.850 --> 00:51:30.100
but with a lot of piercings and shit like that.
Like,
you know,

896
00:51:30.101 --> 00:51:33.910
like at like a million,
they're hanging from fucking like some crazy.

897
00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:38.560
I mean,
I'm done with tattoos,
you know that.
I liked that just,

898
00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:42.220
but maybe not all over the face.
Generally.

899
00:51:43.210 --> 00:51:46.360
Generally you want it a little bit,
you know what I mean?
Like the Mike Tyson one,

900
00:51:46.361 --> 00:51:49.380
I like it now.
Mike Tyson is a bad motherfucker.
I like it.
You know?

901
00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:52.570
And then you know,
Kat von d got some stars and Shit a little bit and you know,

902
00:51:52.571 --> 00:51:54.730
the net ones are cool and all that shit too.
That's all.

903
00:51:54.731 --> 00:51:59.650
But when you're hanging from a crane and you got these rings all around your

904
00:51:59.651 --> 00:52:03.370
skull and they're hanging,
you're in Jesus.
There's something,

905
00:52:03.371 --> 00:52:04.690
I want to know what happened

906
00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:09.640
<v 0>because something happened.
Something happened.
Maybe it was just like me,</v>

907
00:52:09.641 --> 00:52:13.930
maybe his father wasn't around and just think about your,
your situation was bad,

908
00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:18.700
right?
But you,
we all know people who,
who was way worse and we like you,

909
00:52:18.701 --> 00:52:21.960
you got through uninjured,
you know,
no one was raping you.

910
00:52:22.210 --> 00:52:26.920
There's like you got through like relatively,
I never,
you know,

911
00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:31.690
I wouldn't change a thing about my,
nor would I,
but a lot of people didn't.
Right.

912
00:52:31.691 --> 00:52:35.680
And when you see like really fucked up people like really crazy out there
people,

913
00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:39.220
a lot of times that's what they're reacting to.
Whatever kind of abuse it was,

914
00:52:39.221 --> 00:52:41.740
right?
Whether it was sexual abuse,
where it was violence,

915
00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:45.560
whether it was abandonment,
whatever it is,
whatever pain and hurting,
you know,

916
00:52:45.561 --> 00:52:48.820
made them try to try to become something different.

917
00:52:48.821 --> 00:52:51.850
I try to seek out others like her or like him,
you know,

918
00:52:51.851 --> 00:52:53.940
that's what would people do when they formed these lights.

919
00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:55.390
Like what you're talking about,
like being at the wedding.

920
00:52:55.391 --> 00:52:58.570
I wanted to be with your friends.
I remember that exact same feeling.

921
00:52:58.571 --> 00:53:02.860
I only felt normal when I was with my friends.
That's it.
Like every,

922
00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:06.670
every time Alex,
I was like,
oh my God,
I can't be here.
I can't do this.

923
00:53:06.671 --> 00:53:08.200
I can't do this.
I don't want to do this.

924
00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:10.990
I just got to go to my friends and everybody will,
will relax together.

925
00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:13.360
We'll be able to talk and laugh and fuck off.

926
00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:17.770
That was like always the appeal of a hanging out at the pool hall when I was

927
00:53:17.771 --> 00:53:18.531
young,
when I,

928
00:53:18.531 --> 00:53:21.670
when I started hanging out this place called executive billiards in white plains

929
00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:26.040
with my friend Johnny that died from drugs.
Um,
that place

930
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:29.610
<v 1>was just where we'd all,
we're all misfits.
I was like,
how the comedy store is,</v>

931
00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:32.160
that's it.
I,
Mitzi shore actually calls the comedy store,

932
00:53:32.161 --> 00:53:35.610
the island of misfit toys that does like her nickname for it,

933
00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:39.120
because all these weirdos come from all over the web,
but they all,

934
00:53:39.121 --> 00:53:40.980
they go there and they realize when they're,
they're like,

935
00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:43.320
these are the people like me.
There's other people like me.

936
00:53:43.321 --> 00:53:46.200
I just had to find them.
I said to find these fuckers,
it just,

937
00:53:46.201 --> 00:53:50.100
they weren't at the wedding,
they weren't at the Quinceanera back then.

938
00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:54.120
Like when I look at movies from the eighties like in those movies you're looking

939
00:53:54.121 --> 00:53:56.460
at people that are not connected.

940
00:53:56.490 --> 00:53:59.220
They don't have that Internet phone that we got.
You know what I mean?

941
00:53:59.221 --> 00:54:04.140
It's like that life,
there is no joke.
Everyone is disconnected.
Every,

942
00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:08.460
the only thing that we were connected to was TV and radio,

943
00:54:08.461 --> 00:54:12.720
the big networks.
That's the only way we can connect.
And you know,

944
00:54:12.721 --> 00:54:16.740
people say that we're more connected now than ever.
We are in a lot of ways,

945
00:54:16.741 --> 00:54:21.330
but in some ways because we weren't individually connected and there was only

946
00:54:21.331 --> 00:54:25.050
one source,
NBC,
CBS,
ABC,
we actually,

947
00:54:25.051 --> 00:54:29.280
that actually connected everybody and there's everyone listened to the radio
and,

948
00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:30.151
and uh,

949
00:54:30.151 --> 00:54:34.470
the radio stations are creating stars and everybody saw different strokes.

950
00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:38.760
You went to school and like everyone saw eight 30 Friday night on NBC.

951
00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:41.340
Everyone knew these are special spot.

952
00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:46.020
That's how everyone got connected in the special eight o'clock on Thursday.

953
00:54:46.021 --> 00:54:49.560
Cheers and shit.
Everyone got there.
We're so connected.

954
00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:52.950
Way more connected now.
People aren't on those.

955
00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:54.660
Like the radio doesn't have that much power.

956
00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:56.130
I never listened to fucking radio ever.

957
00:54:56.131 --> 00:54:59.370
I'm listening to like satellite radio and she ever listened to radio.

958
00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:04.710
It's always sounded like so everyone is like less,
more connected to their niche,

959
00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:08.100
but they're shit that's huge out there like this.

960
00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:13.340
I was driving down the street and I saw this billboard in downtown La is a King

961
00:55:14.101 --> 00:55:18.600
Daddy King Dad.
He's a white guy.
It'll or apparently is Latin,

962
00:55:18.601 --> 00:55:21.480
but it looks like a white guy like vanilla ice and says King Daddy.

963
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:24.330
I thought it was like,
are they filming a fucking movie?

964
00:55:24.331 --> 00:55:27.070
Like some kind of parody movie here?
That's what I thought it was like,

965
00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:29.430
and then I looked at,
I go,
this is the craziest thing.

966
00:55:29.431 --> 00:55:32.970
It's playing up the staples king dead.
I've never heard of him.
I Wikipedia,

967
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:36.510
he's fucking huge.
Like Holy Shit.

968
00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:40.440
There's people that are huge and and because we're so disconnected with

969
00:55:40.441 --> 00:55:40.861
everybody,

970
00:55:40.861 --> 00:55:44.550
we're just connected more and more with the people that are like us and then

971
00:55:44.551 --> 00:55:46.410
that's it.
Then we could shut everybody out.

972
00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:51.440
We don't have to be all together but the old way and in that one way about NBC,

973
00:55:51.991 --> 00:55:56.991
CBS and we all saw the news and 60 minutes we were at sometimes at those periods

974
00:55:57.361 --> 00:56:00.660
we were all connected.
All of us both,
we were all like one,

975
00:56:00.661 --> 00:56:04.890
we all knew the same shit,
but now we're all on our own planet now.

976
00:56:05.130 --> 00:56:08.620
It's so true.
Like I'll go to someone's Twitter page and there are musicians.

977
00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:11.880
I'm like,
who is this guy?
5 million Twitter followers.
I'm like,
what the fuck?

978
00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:15.450
I never heard of this boy would know that guy because we've got to all be on

979
00:56:15.451 --> 00:56:18.900
those same channels.
Everybody would be on the same bay.
Now we're all,

980
00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:23.920
we get our news from different places like do people still really watch news on

981
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:28.230
<v 3>like Fox News?
It's like there's a lot of people that do them and easy.</v>

982
00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:29.650
There's not a lot.
Just a lot of people that do.

983
00:56:29.651 --> 00:56:32.450
There's a lot of people that only like they'll,
they,

984
00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:34.870
they only follow like right wing news sources.

985
00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:38.350
So they have like a right wing news idea and that's the only thing they talk

986
00:56:38.351 --> 00:56:40.630
about.
And so if they interact with something online,

987
00:56:40.631 --> 00:56:43.700
look clearly you haven't been paying attention cause that's been debunked and

988
00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:45.160
you're like,
okay,
how's it been debunked?

989
00:56:45.161 --> 00:56:47.180
And you'll go and like read how it's been debunked,
done,

990
00:56:47.181 --> 00:56:48.430
hadn't been deep bunked at all.

991
00:56:48.490 --> 00:56:51.870
Everything is there any month deep debunk for a debunked bumped Fred
[inaudible],

992
00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:55.450
Fred debunked every everything like debunked.
But it's really simple.

993
00:56:55.451 --> 00:56:56.800
It's like where you get,

994
00:56:56.920 --> 00:57:00.640
it's really a really is an info or just like Alex Jones says,
it really is,

995
00:57:00.730 --> 00:57:05.020
it isn't about this theory.
And then that theory and the official story,

996
00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:10.200
everyone goes to science but science that that is what uh,

997
00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:14.980
people need to,
it's not just science,
it's unbiased.

998
00:57:14.981 --> 00:57:19.150
Science can is,
where's the science coming from?
Let's look at the science.

999
00:57:19.151 --> 00:57:22.300
You're just reading something off the Internet.
Where's that science come from?

1000
00:57:22.301 --> 00:57:25.900
So it really is information cause it's so easy to brainwash people nowadays.

1001
00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:30.130
It's so easy that media is under control.
It's way harder.

1002
00:57:30.430 --> 00:57:33.000
I think it's way harder to get people to believe shit now than everybody.

1003
00:57:33.070 --> 00:57:37.210
[inaudible] harder to control.
I think it's a brilliant job,
man.

1004
00:57:37.211 --> 00:57:38.590
Who's the thinking?
I mean,

1005
00:57:38.591 --> 00:57:43.500
just like most people think then a w nine 11 was an inside job.

1006
00:57:43.501 --> 00:57:46.330
Most people believe that tower seven fell because of fires because the

1007
00:57:46.331 --> 00:57:49.750
government told them.
I mean,
that's scary shit man.
It is.

1008
00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:54.490
What if nine 11 wasn't an inside job and spending all this time thinking it was,

1009
00:57:54.491 --> 00:57:58.090
what if it was just a bunch of incompetent people,
a bunch of people that are,

1010
00:57:58.110 --> 00:58:01.630
I mean,
the amount of people that had to be involved to make it against piracy,

1011
00:58:01.631 --> 00:58:03.100
it'd be pretty big,
right?
Yeah.

1012
00:58:03.101 --> 00:58:06.160
There wouldn't be more likely that has a bunch of fucking idiots running the

1013
00:58:06.161 --> 00:58:09.900
government,
which we've always known a true then to have this one mastermind,

1014
00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:13.840
stroke of genius.
No,
not at all.
When you look at,
when you look at the evidence,

1015
00:58:13.841 --> 00:58:18.820
I mean when,
uh,
when the nine 11 commission on down this road,
it's really simple.

1016
00:58:18.821 --> 00:58:22.750
It's really silly when the nine 11 commission,
we have video,

1017
00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:25.390
a bunch of different angles of tower seven coming down when they have that video

1018
00:58:25.810 --> 00:58:28.980
tower seven.
So now unquestionably one of the hardest things to kind of show.

1019
00:58:29.070 --> 00:58:32.680
So you just got to just like a detective,
you got to look at it like a detective.

1020
00:58:32.681 --> 00:58:37.420
You got,
you got,
okay.
That building came down.
So we,
the people want to know,
uh,

1021
00:58:37.421 --> 00:58:39.490
what happened at tower seven?
How come it looks like a demo.

1022
00:58:39.491 --> 00:58:43.660
It looks like exploded.
It,
it must be exploding.
That's the conspiracy theory.

1023
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:47.350
What does the government say?
Nothing.
It's not in the nine 11 commission report.

1024
00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:49.810
They deny it.
There's no,
there's,
they don't say anything.

1025
00:58:49.811 --> 00:58:54.520
They don't acknowledge it.
After public pressure of wanting to know if,
uh,

1026
00:58:54.590 --> 00:58:59.140
that was a controlled demo or not.
We want a real investigation.
Finally,
in 2008,

1027
00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:03.560
they fund NIST finally came out,
a government agency comes out and he's,

1028
00:59:03.610 --> 00:59:08.010
and they ask them,
they go,
what?
He gives a little presentation to tower seven,
uh,

1029
00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:10.670
was brought down because it got too hot.
And then the,

1030
00:59:10.690 --> 00:59:12.310
he starts fielding questions and they said,

1031
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:16.810
why didn't you guys test for explosives?
This is what this is all about.

1032
00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:17.831
You know what he said?

1033
00:59:17.831 --> 00:59:21.800
The answer was they were no witnesses that said they heard explosions.

1034
00:59:22.550 --> 00:59:27.020
That was his answer.
And there's uh,
any lists,
lists,

1035
00:59:27.021 --> 00:59:31.490
video after video after video,
after video,

1036
00:59:31.491 --> 00:59:34.640
firemen,
policemen,
witness after witness after witness,

1037
00:59:34.641 --> 00:59:38.660
after which there's all on video,
all in video,
right when it happens.

1038
00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:42.410
And then the bombs went off and then before that plane and then bombs were just,

1039
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:44.860
and then the whole lobby was just bombs.
And then we turned around,

1040
00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:47.330
we were going down.
The element in the elevator blew up in this,

1041
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:51.260
everyone's saying bombs.
The newscasters are saying,
wow,
they're there.

1042
00:59:51.540 --> 00:59:53.680
Everyone's saying bombs are going off everywhere.
Everywhere.

1043
00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:58.070
They took all that shit and fucking buried it.
They were saying,
there's all this,

1044
00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:02.210
they said,
miss,
it's on video.
They're saying,
we didn't have any.
They go,

1045
01:00:02.211 --> 01:00:05.210
you didn't check for explosives.
They go,
no,
we didn't check for explosive.

1046
01:00:05.211 --> 01:00:09.530
There was no witnesses that said they heard explosions and they was,

1047
01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:13.880
you just said,
that shit load.
I got to repeat it.
You know,
when you look at that,

1048
01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:18.320
what does that tell you?
What it tells you that they're fucking gangsters,
man.

1049
01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:21.890
The fucking line,
the gangsters.
It's really simple.
It's,

1050
01:00:21.891 --> 01:00:24.860
it's possible to gangsters.
It's also possible that they're retarded.

1051
01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:28.460
It's also possible that the trying to figure out a way to explain something that

1052
01:00:28.461 --> 01:00:30.830
the,
they just did a really shitty job of explaining the past.

1053
01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:34.460
There's so much in Arkansas.
There's some not an architect.
I'm not an engineer.

1054
01:00:34.461 --> 01:00:37.400
I don't understand how buildings,
what they need to stay up.

1055
01:00:37.401 --> 01:00:40.040
I don't understand what can bring them down.
When I look at that though,

1056
01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:43.220
it looks like a controlled demolition.
It behaves exactly the same.

1057
01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:47.990
I've never heard of a building that falls apart like that and just breaks apart

1058
01:00:47.991 --> 01:00:52.190
and free spot in free fall.
But what do I know?
I mean,
I don't know.

1059
01:00:52.191 --> 01:00:54.920
There was apparently massive fires all throughout the building because there was

1060
01:00:54.921 --> 01:00:57.110
some diesel fuel that they had in the basement,

1061
01:00:57.111 --> 01:01:01.910
giant diesel tanks and if those things were on fire and if the building was on

1062
01:01:01.911 --> 01:01:05.570
fire in some sort of a crazy way where it weakened the whole thing,

1063
01:01:05.571 --> 01:01:09.290
however unlikely where it uniformly,
once one part of it gave out,

1064
01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:12.410
it just gave any for explosives.
I understand that,

1065
01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:17.420
but what would disturb me about that scenario that I just just said was why

1066
01:01:17.421 --> 01:01:20.720
didn't someone sue for that building falling apart like I,

1067
01:01:20.721 --> 01:01:24.230
I would think that if that was my building and my building just caved in,

1068
01:01:24.231 --> 01:01:25.550
when it caught on fire,
I'd be like,

1069
01:01:25.730 --> 01:01:29.480
let me show you fuck heads some videos of buildings that didn't cave in because

1070
01:01:29.481 --> 01:01:32.330
they were up all A's just on fire.

1071
01:01:32.331 --> 01:01:35.330
Like every fucking corner of the building is fire and this,

1072
01:01:35.331 --> 01:01:38.960
this is just fire inside the building and it fell apart.
I would sue.
Yeah,

1073
01:01:38.961 --> 01:01:42.860
there a fucked up so much.
It's so deep.
The whole,
what do you think,

1074
01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:45.470
what do you think happens if you,
if you believe this,

1075
01:01:45.471 --> 01:01:49.010
if you believe that this is a conspiracy to take down tower seven?
Well,
this,

1076
01:01:49.011 --> 01:01:51.560
this is,
I want to say this.
I always thought I was,

1077
01:01:51.770 --> 01:01:56.180
I knew the nine 11 conspiracy quite well.
I kinda,

1078
01:01:56.450 --> 01:02:00.380
I kinda understood how it,
you know,
I could argue with people.
I thought it was,

1079
01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:03.560
I thought I was a brown belt.
Oh my God.

1080
01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:07.880
I watched this documentary that I don't even know if it's out yet.
Uh,

1081
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:11.420
that dude who put it together,
he sent it to me.
It's five hours long,

1082
01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:16.400
five hours.
I watched it twice.
Or Oh my God,
it's fucking,

1083
01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:20.190
and it's all news clips and he,
and he's narrating through it.
He's got so

1084
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:23.040
<v 1>much information about how it went fucking down.</v>

1085
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:26.910
Alex Jones is like a purple belt compared to this guy.
His name is Ryan Dawson.

1086
01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:31.800
And the documentary is the,
um,
the empire unmasked and mass.

1087
01:02:31.801 --> 01:02:35.310
I kissed en masse,
the empire math,
I can't even say unmasked,

1088
01:02:35.490 --> 01:02:40.380
but whole Lee Shit.
It gets so fucking,

1089
01:02:41.070 --> 01:02:43.650
it's like watching,
it's like watching Harry,

1090
01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:48.180
one of the like a movie that was a book watching a movie and then watching it

1091
01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:51.930
three times and then going back and reading the book and you're like,
oh my God,

1092
01:02:51.931 --> 01:02:53.490
there's so much shit.

1093
01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:56.880
There's such a back story and there's all these different players and all this

1094
01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:58.920
evidence.
That was,
dude,

1095
01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:02.400
there's no way one of my buddy can watch that documentary and still think and

1096
01:03:02.401 --> 01:03:05.370
he's got all the evidence.
Did he breaks it all down dude,
it's,
it's,

1097
01:03:05.550 --> 01:03:07.250
there's so much,
there's so much.

1098
01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:10.590
One of my favorite things about nine 11 it never gets brought up was the press

1099
01:03:10.591 --> 01:03:14.250
conference had Donald Rumsfeld had the day before the Pentagon got hit.

1100
01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:18.690
Well he was talking about all the money that was missing was like trillions of

1101
01:03:18.690 --> 01:03:19.290
dollars,
right?

1102
01:03:19.290 --> 01:03:23.190
Like trillions of dollars they couldn't account for and then the plane slams

1103
01:03:23.191 --> 01:03:24.510
into the accounting department.

1104
01:03:26.190 --> 01:03:29.640
I mean if we are living in a movie,
this is an awesome movie.

1105
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:32.640
I want to know if that is true.
Find off the plane,
hit the Pentagon,

1106
01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:35.270
hit the accounting department to deal with it.
That's what everybody always says.

1107
01:03:35.410 --> 01:03:38.760
Bill Intelligence Office,
which was investigating a lot of these,
uh,

1108
01:03:38.761 --> 01:03:43.680
illegal securities.
It was all,
dude,
it was according to this documentary,

1109
01:03:43.681 --> 01:03:48.480
the empire and mass in a nutshell,
in a nutshell,
in a nutshell.
Aliens,

1110
01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:52.830
Saudi Arabia there first,

1111
01:03:52.831 --> 01:03:56.490
first I want to say first I want to say I love this country.

1112
01:03:56.580 --> 01:04:00.000
I love the United States.
I just area Eddie Bravo.
Just,

1113
01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:03.210
I'm just scared of the government.
That's okay.
I love the country.

1114
01:04:03.330 --> 01:04:05.370
But we have some in every government,

1115
01:04:05.371 --> 01:04:08.280
people would agree that there's a criminal element in every government.

1116
01:04:08.370 --> 01:04:11.340
Everybody believes that there's crooks run and shit,
right?

1117
01:04:11.341 --> 01:04:13.810
So I'm not saying anything that crazy the,

1118
01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:18.180
according to this documentary,
the it's dude,

1119
01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:20.520
you got to go way back like a hundred years.

1120
01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:25.260
It's all tied together from the banana wars in the early 19 hundreds.

1121
01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:30.240
It's all about drug trade between sent,
controlling Central America.

1122
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:33.210
First of all,
before you go into any conspiracy theories,

1123
01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:36.720
the one conspiracy theory that is,
uh,
uh,

1124
01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:40.740
that's real is Iran Contra conspiracy theory.
That's actually real.

1125
01:04:40.770 --> 01:04:44.010
It's out and what have you look into it.
What was it?

1126
01:04:44.610 --> 01:04:49.200
George Bush senior got busted him and Oliver North.

1127
01:04:49.290 --> 01:04:53.730
There was a few key people doing some shit that the rest of the government

1128
01:04:53.731 --> 01:04:55.740
didn't know about.
That's a conspiracy theory.

1129
01:04:55.741 --> 01:05:00.741
They were running guns and drugs through Arkansas and Iran and Israel were all

1130
01:05:01.861 --> 01:05:06.420
involved.
It's a big drug,
arms ring.
That's all it is.

1131
01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:08.520
They're all making money off it.
They've been doing,

1132
01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:12.450
it's the banana wars were all about the drugs they used the United States used

1133
01:05:12.451 --> 01:05:16.800
to with other countries go in and fucking Jack them and take their shit.

1134
01:05:16.890 --> 01:05:20.260
Then they realize it's easier if we just control,

1135
01:05:20.261 --> 01:05:24.760
the government will organize a coup and we'll pill.

1136
01:05:24.761 --> 01:05:27.340
I'd all guy in and we'll just take that shit.
We don't need to fight them.

1137
01:05:27.341 --> 01:05:30.160
So they just pulled all the military out and they've been doing that.

1138
01:05:30.161 --> 01:05:33.460
It's all the Nicaragua,
the Iran Contra.
They got busted,

1139
01:05:33.461 --> 01:05:35.140
but they've been doing it forever.

1140
01:05:35.141 --> 01:05:39.310
It's like a family business when that when you're at the top,
they got busted.

1141
01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:40.660
That's not a conspiracy theory.

1142
01:05:40.810 --> 01:05:44.330
They used to think it was a conspiracy theory in the 70s and everyone's like,

1143
01:05:44.350 --> 01:05:46.780
conspiracy theory.
There's news reports.
People are like,
it's crazy.

1144
01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:49.840
And then it comes out 10 years later they get busted.

1145
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:52.270
Ronald Reagan says he didn't know shit.

1146
01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:56.500
He doesn't recall shit about vice president.
It's George Sr.

1147
01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:01.210
He's the ex head of the CIA.
He's running the whole fucking thing.
I know I'm,

1148
01:06:01.211 --> 01:06:05.470
well,
we're careful about people's attention span,
but they get busted.

1149
01:06:05.471 --> 01:06:08.170
You got to explain this at the top right there in the early eighties,

1150
01:06:08.410 --> 01:06:10.990
the shit that happened from JFK and beyond,

1151
01:06:10.991 --> 01:06:14.350
but JFK is connected to Iran Contra,

1152
01:06:14.530 --> 01:06:17.980
which is connected at nine 11.
It's all the same fucking players.

1153
01:06:18.130 --> 01:06:21.370
It's all the same.
It's a big old drug cartel going on.

1154
01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:24.460
So all the big Ah,
it's a corporate.

1155
01:06:25.330 --> 01:06:28.530
It's all about uh,
um,

1156
01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:32.440
the mob sells the drugs that the drug that the government brings in.

1157
01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:34.240
They always had a mob relationship.

1158
01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:39.340
There's always been the government running drugs using the mob to make money for

1159
01:06:39.341 --> 01:06:42.070
covert operations.
They've always done that shit.

1160
01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:46.030
That's the way they do it and all everything that's happening in the Middle
East,

1161
01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:50.080
that's all it is.
Do America Israel,
they want to fuck up.

1162
01:06:50.110 --> 01:06:53.350
They want her to fuck up.
I wreck the criminal element they want,

1163
01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:57.790
but United States like they need to control the poppy seed.
So it was oil,
drugs,

1164
01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:00.550
the same shit.
They just needed a reason to get in there.

1165
01:07:00.790 --> 01:07:03.910
Everybody knows that we invaded Iraq because of nine 11,

1166
01:07:04.090 --> 01:07:08.830
but there now we know that there's zero connection.
That was all bullshit.

1167
01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:11.290
We know.
That's like,
that's a fact.
That's not a conspiracy theory.

1168
01:07:11.410 --> 01:07:13.240
There was no weapons of mass destruction.

1169
01:07:13.450 --> 01:07:15.600
We just needed a reason to get in there.
Dude.
They,

1170
01:07:15.790 --> 01:07:20.490
there's documents that they talk about this,
these great con,
uh,
uh,

1171
01:07:20.530 --> 01:07:22.090
p Naca,
this group,

1172
01:07:22.091 --> 01:07:25.930
like how are we gonna take over and what is the best route to do?

1173
01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:29.290
Talking about we need a reason to get into the Middle East and control.

1174
01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:32.530
We need a big event.
It's on fucking paper.
Then.
Didn't never give a shit.

1175
01:07:32.531 --> 01:07:32.790
You ever see

1176
01:07:32.790 --> 01:07:36.950
<v 0>the video where General General Wesley Clark starts talking about a invading</v>

1177
01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:38.900
like what?
What's going to be done.
The,
the,

1178
01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:43.040
the timeline that's been laid out for United States to invade all these other

1179
01:07:43.041 --> 01:07:46.400
countries and take over or you ever seen that?
I heard something about that.

1180
01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:48.250
You never seen the video?
No.
What is this?

1181
01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:50.390
You should watch it because it's pretty fascinating.
What's it called?

1182
01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:52.970
General Wesley Clark.
Who's the guy who ran for president?

1183
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.170
I think he ran for president in 2004.
Yeah.
When did he run for president?

1184
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:03.700
2008 maybe.
Maybe 2008 whenever it was that he ran for president.
Um,

1185
01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:06.950
he was four.
He was a,
uh,

1186
01:08:07.610 --> 01:08:11.810
just decorated general and like a,
a patriot,
a war hero.

1187
01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:14.960
A guy who was like really well respected and I,

1188
01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:19.790
it was on Charlie rose and he laid out the government's plan.

1189
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.940
Like the people that are you would,
you would be fascinated by that.

1190
01:08:22.941 --> 01:08:25.650
So I'll play it for you because for people that are listening to this and going

1191
01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:28.850
agenda 21 bullying,
he's explaining,

1192
01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:34.010
explaining like what he was privy to as a four star general or whatever it was.

1193
01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:38.660
And I'm in this video for people that listen to this go and this is all crazy

1194
01:08:38.661 --> 01:08:39.494
conspiracy talk.

1195
01:08:39.830 --> 01:08:44.780
When you hear a guy like Wesley Clark presidential candidate would be like very

1196
01:08:44.781 --> 01:08:45.340
decorated,

1197
01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:49.610
very well respected general saying these things like listen to what he says.

1198
01:08:49.950 --> 01:08:51.350
Got It.
Listen us,

1199
01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:55.810
<v 5>about 10 days after nine 11 I went through the Pentagon and I saw secretary</v>

1200
01:08:55.811 --> 01:08:59.040
Rumsfeld and and deputy searcher Wolfowitz.

1201
01:08:59.110 --> 01:09:03.970
I went downstairs just sail over some of the people on the Joint Staff who we've

1202
01:09:03.971 --> 01:09:08.440
made the decision,
we're going to war with Iraq.
This was honor band.
He said,
sir,

1203
01:09:08.441 --> 01:09:11.560
you got to come in.
You've got to come in and talk to me a second.
I said,

1204
01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:15.370
September.
I said,
we're going to war with Iraq.
Why?

1205
01:09:16.510 --> 01:09:17.070
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1206
01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:20.820
<v 5>He said,
I don't know.
He said,</v>

1207
01:09:20.821 --> 01:09:25.320
I guess they don't know what else to do.
So,
uh,
I said,
well,

1208
01:09:25.321 --> 01:09:29.940
did they find some information,
collect connecting Saddam to al Qaeda?
He said,
no,

1209
01:09:29.941 --> 01:09:32.220
no.
Was just,
there's nothing new that way.

1210
01:09:32.250 --> 01:09:35.880
They just made the decision to go to war with Iraq.
He said,

1211
01:09:35.881 --> 01:09:38.940
I guess it's like we don't know what to do about terrorists,

1212
01:09:38.941 --> 01:09:42.390
but we got a good military and we can take nail.

1213
01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:48.560
So I came back to see him a few weeks later and by that time we were bombing in

1214
01:09:48.631 --> 01:09:51.480
Afghanistan.
I said,
are we still going to war with Iraq?
And he said,
oh,

1215
01:09:51.481 --> 01:09:55.410
it's worse than that.
He sit down governments and he said,

1216
01:09:55.411 --> 01:09:57.780
I guess if the only tool you have is a hammer,

1217
01:09:57.781 --> 01:10:00.690
every problem reached over on his desk.
He picked up a piece of paper.
He said,

1218
01:10:00.691 --> 01:10:01.950
I just,
he said,

1219
01:10:01.951 --> 01:10:05.820
I just got this down from upstairs and saturate events office today and he said,

1220
01:10:06.150 --> 01:10:10.800
this is a memo that describes how we're going to take out seven countries in

1221
01:10:10.801 --> 01:10:15.300
five years starting with Iraq and in Syria,
Lebanon,
Libya,

1222
01:10:15.301 --> 01:10:18.000
Somalia,
Sudan and finishing off Iran.

1223
01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:22.500
<v 0>Come on,
man.
Now this is the scariest part.</v>

1224
01:10:22.730 --> 01:10:24.980
<v 5>It is a business.
Gary leads.
Do you want to keep it going?</v>

1225
01:10:24.981 --> 01:10:28.760
Had there been no oil layer,
it would be like Africa.

1226
01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:34.060
Nobody is threatening to intervene in Africa.

1227
01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:38.890
The problem is the opposite.
We keep asking for people to intervene and stop it.

1228
01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:41.190
And there's,
uh,

1229
01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:45.280
there's no question that the presence of petroleum throughout the region has

1230
01:10:45.310 --> 01:10:47.350
sparked great power involvement.

1231
01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:51.010
Whether that was the specific motivation for the coup or not,
I can't tell you,

1232
01:10:51.011 --> 01:10:53.230
but,
but there was definitely,

1233
01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:57.040
there's always been this attitude that somehow we could intervene and use force

1234
01:10:57.041 --> 01:10:57.874
in the region.

1235
01:10:58.350 --> 01:10:59.550
<v 0>Boom.
Yeah.</v>

1236
01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:03.060
The scariest thing is you could watch something like this and like a skeptic who

1237
01:11:03.061 --> 01:11:06.270
doesn't believe in any conspiracy,
you gotta watch this.
They'll,

1238
01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:09.240
they'll watch it and something like there've been programmed,

1239
01:11:09.241 --> 01:11:14.100
like they'd been hypnotized.
Like no matter what,
obey the official story.

1240
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:17.580
<v 4>Do you see that video that was just about to come out?
Major Smedley Butler.</v>

1241
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:23.190
Check that out.
That the,
the video that is about to come up was the,
the um,

1242
01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:28.220
the letter that major Smedley Butler wrote in like 1930 something and he was a,

1243
01:11:29.161 --> 01:11:31.850
another famous war hero who,
uh,

1244
01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:36.060
wrote a letter like realizing when he was leaving the military.

1245
01:11:36.061 --> 01:11:40.440
That war is a racket major,
general Smedley Butler and the fascist takeover.

1246
01:11:40.441 --> 01:11:43.740
The USA
is it put play anything

1247
01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:50.510
<v 6>you're to roughly locate any community somewhere along that scale.</v>

1248
01:11:50.570 --> 01:11:54.100
It's running all the way from democracy to despotism.

1249
01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:00.760
This man makes it his job and just study these things.

1250
01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:05.260
Avoid the comfortable idea,

1251
01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:10.330
but the mayor form of government kind of itself safe guide a nation against

1252
01:12:10.331 --> 01:12:13.300
despotism.
Okay.

1253
01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:19.020
<v 7>50 business despotism was often a useful tool for securing foreign markets and</v>

1254
01:12:19.021 --> 01:12:20.100
pursuing profits.

1255
01:12:21.090 --> 01:12:24.150
One of the US Marine Corps most highly decorated generals,

1256
01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:29.160
Smedley Darlington Butler by his own account helped pass a fly Mexico for

1257
01:12:29.161 --> 01:12:33.120
American oil companies,
Haiti and Cuba for National City Bank,

1258
01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:36.060
Nicaragua for the Brown brothers brokerage,

1259
01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:41.460
the Dominican Republic for Sugar Interests Honduras for us food companies in

1260
01:12:42.451 --> 01:12:44.310
China or standard oil

1261
01:12:46.610 --> 01:12:50.270
general Butler services.
We're also in demand in the United States itself.

1262
01:12:50.271 --> 01:12:55.271
In the 1930s as President Franklin Delano Roosevelt saw to relieve the misery of

1263
01:12:55.551 --> 01:12:59.900
the depression to your public enterprise and tougher regulations on corporate

1264
01:12:59.901 --> 01:13:01.370
exploitation and Ms Deeds,

1265
01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:06.810
<v 6>power to you,
President Roosevelt,
the entire country's behind you,</v>

1266
01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:08.260
preload with hope,

1267
01:13:10.150 --> 01:13:13.090
<v 7>but the country was not entirely behind the populist president.</v>

1268
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:17.830
Large parts of the corporate elite despise what Roosevelt's new deal stood for.

1269
01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:23.940
And so in 1934 a group of conspirators sought to involve General Butler and the

1270
01:13:24.531 --> 01:13:25.364
trees in his plan.

1271
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:27.480
<v 8>I was lying to me,</v>

1272
01:13:27.481 --> 01:13:31.680
what's the form and organization and veteran user that blackboard is at club,

1273
01:13:31.681 --> 01:13:33.610
at least you intimidate the governor,

1274
01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:36.550
<v 7>not the corporate cabal.
I picked the wrong.</v>

1275
01:13:36.551 --> 01:13:41.090
Matt Butler was fed up with being lucky call and gangster for capitalism.

1276
01:13:46.010 --> 01:13:46.930
<v 6>All right.</v>

1277
01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:49.170
<v 8>Period.
Before the congressional committee,</v>

1278
01:13:49.470 --> 01:13:54.050
the highest representation of the American people under subpoena your towel.

1279
01:13:54.051 --> 01:13:58.410
What I knew of activities which I believe might lead to an attempt to set up a

1280
01:13:58.411 --> 01:13:59.580
fascist dictatorship.

1281
01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:04.560
The upshot of that whole thing was that I was supposed to lead an organization

1282
01:14:04.561 --> 01:14:09.150
of 500,000 men,
which would be able to take over the functions of government.

1283
01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:10.773
<v 7>How crazy is that?</v>

1284
01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:14.650
A congressional committee ultimately found evidence of a plot to overthrow

1285
01:14:14.651 --> 01:14:19.650
Roosevelt.
According to Butler,
that's included represent farmers.

1286
01:14:19.651 --> 01:14:21.490
Some of America's top corporations,

1287
01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:25.720
they own the CDC be Morgan Dupont and Goodyear tire

1288
01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:35.140
studies.
Chairman of Goodyear tire knows to corporations to dominate government.

1289
01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:37.600
A Koo is no longer necessary.

1290
01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:42.290
<v 6>Corporations have gone global.
And by going global,</v>

1291
01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:47.680
the governments have lost some control of compilations regardless of whether the

1292
01:14:48.921 --> 01:14:51.410
cooperation can be trusted.
Oh,
cannot be trusted.

1293
01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:55.820
Governments today do not have over the complications,

1294
01:14:55.850 --> 01:15:00.850
the power that they had and the leverage that they had 50 or 60 years ago.

1295
01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:02.930
That's the force of major change.

1296
01:15:02.931 --> 01:15:07.931
So of good governance have become powerless compared to where they were before.

1297
01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:13.900
Capitalism today to the towering heights and has displaced politics and

1298
01:15:14.751 --> 01:15:18.380
politicians as the new high priests and raining all the guards.

1299
01:15:18.381 --> 01:15:19.500
So if our systems,

1300
01:15:19.501 --> 01:15:24.230
so capitalism and its principal protagonists and players,

1301
01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:29.260
corporate CEOs have been accorded unusual power and access.

1302
01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:33.170
It was just not to deny the significance of government and politicians,

1303
01:15:33.171 --> 01:15:34.910
but these are the new high priests.

1304
01:15:36.030 --> 01:15:39.780
<v 3>Okay,
well that's all.
Uh,</v>

1305
01:15:39.810 --> 01:15:43.200
that's pretty much proven what you're saying.
I mean that when you look at that,

1306
01:15:43.201 --> 01:15:46.320
you look at Iran Contra and,
or at least this is how this is,

1307
01:15:46.321 --> 01:15:49.080
the scariest part is,
you know,

1308
01:15:49.590 --> 01:15:53.220
certain amount of people can be hypnotized.
You know you've got a hypnotist show,

1309
01:15:53.310 --> 01:15:56.130
the guy before the show starts,
he does a couple of tests and he goes,

1310
01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:59.280
I got that idiot and I got that motherfucker all you other sit down.

1311
01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:02.500
He knows he could figure it out.
Right.
It's not a conspiracy theory.
Right,
right.

1312
01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:03.870
He took,
what is it?
That's,

1313
01:16:03.930 --> 01:16:07.050
that's pretty crazy that he knows that there's a few people that he gets

1314
01:16:07.051 --> 01:16:08.790
hypnotized and there's others that you can't.

1315
01:16:09.150 --> 01:16:12.210
So then he makes them do weird shit.
And people have been,
is hypnotism Rio,

1316
01:16:12.211 --> 01:16:14.790
do Pete,
can people be hypnotized and yes,
it can.
They,

1317
01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:18.330
is it real that you can hypnotize someone,
wake them up.

1318
01:16:18.331 --> 01:16:20.970
They appear to be woken up and when they hear you say a certain word,

1319
01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.670
they react a certain way.
Is that real or is that,
that's real.

1320
01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:27.810
That real with some people if,
uh,
if they,
they get good enough at it.

1321
01:16:28.170 --> 01:16:30.720
I've seen documentaries,
but maybe they were hoaxes.
I don't know.

1322
01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:32.970
I don't know if they're real.
I'm pretty sure.
Well,

1323
01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:37.380
I've been hypnotized and hypnotism is real.
Okay.
Definitely.
What Israel,
well,

1324
01:16:37.770 --> 01:16:39.990
it's not,
well,
at least with me.

1325
01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:45.030
What what the guy was trying to do was not what I think would be done if someone

1326
01:16:45.031 --> 01:16:47.160
was trying to get you to do something like that.
But if it's,

1327
01:16:47.310 --> 01:16:52.310
if is it possible to hypnotize someone in their own whatever way,

1328
01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:57.300
whatever way works,
and tell them when you wake up,
when I hear,

1329
01:16:57.301 --> 01:16:58.710
when you hear the bell,

1330
01:16:59.190 --> 01:17:02.130
you are going to react a certain way or you're going to think a certain way and

1331
01:17:02.131 --> 01:17:06.930
so that person could be totally awake at work and then you could say something

1332
01:17:06.931 --> 01:17:10.050
and they react a certain way that I'm sure if it appears

1333
01:17:10.050 --> 01:17:10.990
<v 2>that,
I think that's,</v>

1334
01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:14.420
that's like just give it a lot of time from the hypnosis event.
Oh No,

1335
01:17:14.421 --> 01:17:18.080
not at work,
but I'm not,
I'm not,
I don't know why I said at work,

1336
01:17:18.090 --> 01:17:20.210
but I'm just saying if it work,
who knows?

1337
01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:24.020
Maybe it's supposed to wear off after five minutes or 10 minute.
When does it,

1338
01:17:24.021 --> 01:17:25.190
when you change states,

1339
01:17:25.890 --> 01:17:29.300
if you're in a state of anger is state of depression are saying there's like a

1340
01:17:29.301 --> 01:17:31.870
state that you achieve when you get hypnotized.
Okay.

1341
01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:33.650
Even though you're aware of it,
you're awake.

1342
01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:36.560
Let me just explain what it feels like.
It felt like,
like all,

1343
01:17:36.561 --> 01:17:39.830
it's almost like I was on drugs like a,
I went to some weird,

1344
01:17:39.831 --> 01:17:43.580
like a k hole or something like that.
Like it was a very strange,

1345
01:17:43.610 --> 01:17:47.750
it felt very almost not,
I want to,
I want to say out of body,
but inner body.

1346
01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:50.210
But I was awake,
I was never asleep.

1347
01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:53.390
But like if anything crazy happened,

1348
01:17:53.391 --> 01:17:56.960
like an alarm went off or I would've got right up,
like I would have been fine.

1349
01:17:57.230 --> 01:17:59.240
But in that state,

1350
01:17:59.241 --> 01:18:02.240
like someone can talk you into that state and you put yourself,

1351
01:18:02.241 --> 01:18:04.970
you willingly allow yourself to get into that state.

1352
01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:07.820
That's for me in this situation,

1353
01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:13.370
if it was a different situation and it was a more gullible person or more easily

1354
01:18:13.490 --> 01:18:16.400
led person,
and then the,
the hypnosis,

1355
01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:21.700
a professional was like more into doing that more into hypnosis professionals,

1356
01:18:22.041 --> 01:18:25.010
not hypnotist.
Okay.
If that guy was,

1357
01:18:25.030 --> 01:18:30.030
I'm more into getting you to remember a certain noise or certain sound and when

1358
01:18:30.561 --> 01:18:32.680
you heard that sound,
you're gonna associate with something.
Yeah,

1359
01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:36.590
I think that's possible.
Okay,
so let's assume that's real and it probably is.

1360
01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:39.500
It might be all hoaxes,
but I've seen documentaries.

1361
01:18:39.530 --> 01:18:42.560
I don't know for sure it's a documentary.
I don't think it is a hoax.

1362
01:18:43.210 --> 01:18:44.270
This assume it's real.

1363
01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:49.420
If that's real then that then you can say that a certain percent of the

1364
01:18:51.021 --> 01:18:55.190
population
can be hypnotized.
Right?

1365
01:18:55.580 --> 01:18:58.420
Just like that.
Not everybody,
but a certain,
what is that percentage?

1366
01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:03.440
Let's just say that just guests and say what if it's 30% of the population has

1367
01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:05.480
hitting the hypnotism abilities?

1368
01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:09.470
Is might be everyone if you allow yourself to be,
yes,
it might be everyone.

1369
01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:14.240
Exactly.
It might be,
let's just say 30% let's say 60 40 whatever.

1370
01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:17.870
Then that if those documentaries that were talking about it,
it's true.

1371
01:19:17.930 --> 01:19:21.260
If it is real that you could do that,
then can you

1372
01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:26.960
trigger something?
The people that can be hypnotized,
like 30% of them.

1373
01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:30.650
Can you a program,
something on TV,
whether it's in the news or whatever,

1374
01:19:30.970 --> 01:19:31.790
something.

1375
01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:36.710
Are they doing something to handle those people and get them to only believe in

1376
01:19:36.711 --> 01:19:39.020
what they see on TV?
You don't have to do it like that.

1377
01:19:39.021 --> 01:19:41.350
You don't have to do it with it.
With that one possible.
Yeah.

1378
01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:43.050
But you wouldn't do it that way.
No,

1379
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:45.980
because you'd have to sit down with those people and actually hypnotize them.

1380
01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:47.330
It'd get them into that state.

1381
01:19:47.331 --> 01:19:50.030
You have to know what kind of state they're in when you're bringing these

1382
01:19:50.031 --> 01:19:54.970
suggestions into their mind.
Sometimes hypnotize Watson narco highs.

1383
01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:56.600
Fuck yeah,
but that's different.

1384
01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:02.370
I don't think the government is trying to hit me time.
You're not,

1385
01:20:02.410 --> 01:20:04.790
you don't believe that the government government's trying to hypnotize you

1386
01:20:04.791 --> 01:20:08.190
through Netflix?
Probably.
I believe

1387
01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:10.820
<v 4>that.
I don't think Netflix is Inca.
Who?</v>

1388
01:20:10.821 --> 01:20:13.560
To the government that meetings with them.
They seem like normal people.

1389
01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:18.460
<v 1>Um,
but my point is,</v>

1390
01:20:18.461 --> 01:20:22.570
this is just my wild conspiracy theory that,
I mean an answer,

1391
01:20:22.571 --> 01:20:26.890
an attempt to answer the question,
why you can show someone film like that.

1392
01:20:26.891 --> 01:20:31.450
Like what you just him like that and there's five hours of shit like that.

1393
01:20:31.690 --> 01:20:35.100
The empire and mass is five hours and shit like that.
Okay.
What?

1394
01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:40.780
People can see it,
right?
They can see the build tower seven go boom.

1395
01:20:41.180 --> 01:20:43.450
But they're going to believe the government.
I look,

1396
01:20:43.451 --> 01:20:45.080
I keep saying it's one of those towers

1397
01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:49.000
<v 4>looks to me like an implosion.
It looks to me like a demo,
Alicia,</v>

1398
01:20:49.190 --> 01:20:51.470
but I don't know shit.
I don't know shit.

1399
01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:54.800
You know there's two their roles in giant fire inside that building,

1400
01:20:54.801 --> 01:20:57.410
the cost of building the fail and it collapsed like that.

1401
01:20:57.411 --> 01:20:59.720
And I'm talking all this crazy shit.
I know they blew it up.

1402
01:20:59.721 --> 01:21:01.520
I know they use bombs then I'm an idiot.

1403
01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:05.810
And so if I'm saying I know one way or the other,
it's kind of crazy.
I can't,

1404
01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:09.080
you can't really say it.
I don't have enough information.
But you've got to have,

1405
01:21:09.081 --> 01:21:13.950
based on what you see your opinion based on one for sure.

1406
01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:18.390
That's not my opinion.
My opinion is it looks like a controlled demolition.
Yeah.

1407
01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:21.800
Now if you see a submission,
okay,

1408
01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:24.350
and you know it's a dog shit submission and the guy taps out,
you go,

1409
01:21:24.351 --> 01:21:25.160
well that guy quit.

1410
01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:28.100
Well you'll know that guy quit because you'll know that that's not a good

1411
01:21:28.101 --> 01:21:30.050
submission because you're an expert in submissions.

1412
01:21:30.290 --> 01:21:32.900
When I see a building collapse like that,
I'll say,
yeah,

1413
01:21:32.901 --> 01:21:36.020
it looks like a controlled demolition because that's what it looks like,

1414
01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:38.180
but that doesn't mean it's a controlled demolition.

1415
01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:42.290
You could easily have been a crazy fire that caused a catastrophic failure of

1416
01:21:42.291 --> 01:21:43.430
the structure of that building.

1417
01:21:43.550 --> 01:21:46.140
And I don't know Jack Shit about structures of bill,

1418
01:21:46.350 --> 01:21:47.890
<v 1>of course.
No,
I can't say that.</v>

1419
01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:52.750
Nobody's saying that you do and no one is saying that you,
based on what you're,

1420
01:21:52.751 --> 01:21:55.420
like a juror isn't an expert in all this forensics.

1421
01:21:55.540 --> 01:21:59.890
You're going on what the experts say.
You're not going on.
Jurors not going to go,

1422
01:21:59.891 --> 01:22:02.770
well,
I don't know if he killed him.
I wasn't actually there.
So I don't know.

1423
01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:06.670
There's all this evidence,
the Jurassic based on the evidence,
you have to,

1424
01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:10.320
you know,
it's,
it's okay to say,
uh,

1425
01:22:10.330 --> 01:22:12.430
based on all the gangster shit that's going on.

1426
01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:15.900
They don't say shit for seven years.
A detective would go later.
Okay,

1427
01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:18.840
<v 4>let's get away from that.
Here's what's interesting about that building.</v>

1428
01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:22.260
Here's one of the things that makes this,
this theory more fascinating,

1429
01:22:22.261 --> 01:22:23.280
and this is a fact.

1430
01:22:23.670 --> 01:22:27.420
They had offices inside that building of the NSA.

1431
01:22:27.421 --> 01:22:32.421
I think it was the CIO who find out what offices were inside tower seven cause

1432
01:22:33.181 --> 01:22:36.600
it was a crazy building.
It wasn't just like a regular building.

1433
01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:40.440
That building had some really nutty shit stored in it.

1434
01:22:40.590 --> 01:22:45.530
Some crazy information in offices like w it was,
it wasn't like,
oh my God,
they,

1435
01:22:45.550 --> 01:22:47.100
they crushed the prudential building.

1436
01:22:47.130 --> 01:22:51.840
We lost all this insurance policy numbers and you know,
data.
Nope.
No,

1437
01:22:51.841 --> 01:22:54.360
it wasn't that.
No,
it was way nuttier than that.
It was,

1438
01:22:54.361 --> 01:22:59.160
it was like really intense foreign policy shit.
Intense financial shit.

1439
01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:03.510
It was like there's some crazy offices inside there.
When you got there,
Jamie,

1440
01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:06.190
here we go.
Like look at,
look at what was in building

1441
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:08.200
<v 2>seven.
This is fucking fascinating.</v>

1442
01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:14.170
Can you imagine Simon Smith and Barney.
Okay.
Uh,
which is a financial company,

1443
01:23:14.171 --> 01:23:17.950
Internal Revenue Service,
regional council,
US Secret Service,

1444
01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:22.360
American Express Bank,
International Standard Chartered Bank,
uh,

1445
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:27.040
provident financial market management.
Um,
Hartford Insurance Group,

1446
01:23:27.610 --> 01:23:31.780
first date management group,
Federal Loan Bank,
a lot of banks.
But in a,

1447
01:23:31.781 --> 01:23:35.350
I see securities securities and Exchange Commission.

1448
01:23:35.351 --> 01:23:38.920
That's when it gets really crazy security and exchange commissions like that's

1449
01:23:38.921 --> 01:23:42.910
the fucking that,
I mean that's,
that's the mother lode of money right there.

1450
01:23:43.150 --> 01:23:46.680
New York City office of emergency management.
What would it,

1451
01:23:46.681 --> 01:23:50.440
what would a decent detective think based on all this?
Would it go?
No,

1452
01:23:50.441 --> 01:23:53.590
they couldn't do.
He would look at that and you'd go,
wow,

1453
01:23:53.650 --> 01:23:57.640
it's convenient at that building collapsed because it seems like there's a lot

1454
01:23:57.641 --> 01:24:01.570
of fucking tenants in there that probably had a lot of crazy information.

1455
01:24:01.571 --> 01:24:06.571
The Secret Service Security Exchange Commission and the office of emergency

1456
01:24:06.671 --> 01:24:10.720
management.
That's a,
that's a lot of like and then all those banks.

1457
01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:14.090
It's just high level feelings.
Really important shit.
High level gangster.

1458
01:24:14.091 --> 01:24:17.110
She knows.
I thought it was the CIA.
I thought the CIA was in there as well.

1459
01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:21.910
A small office of the Cin is was Eddie Bravo conspiracy theorist.

1460
01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:24.320
He knows I'm just a blue belt competitor ride dos.

1461
01:24:24.350 --> 01:24:27.640
Well there's a lot of people have spent their whole life looking at it.

1462
01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:30.820
If it is what we said or what I said,

1463
01:24:30.821 --> 01:24:34.900
rather a catastrophic failure of a structure based on bill.

1464
01:24:35.890 --> 01:24:40.210
If it is,
if it that is what a convenient building to collapse.

1465
01:24:40.211 --> 01:24:43.430
Like it seems like those offices would have a lot of really crazy shit in them

1466
01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:48.510
and if a decent detective found out that oh it looks like to over 2000

1467
01:24:49.090 --> 01:24:51.340
architects risking their license,

1468
01:24:51.341 --> 01:24:55.390
risking that gorilla credibility is going to go against the government.
Right,

1469
01:24:55.391 --> 01:24:56.224
right,
right.
But

1470
01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:00.610
the truth is that what you talking about those day they have the balls to do

1471
01:25:00.611 --> 01:25:03.820
what everyone else is like.
They don't want,
most people don't want any trouble.

1472
01:25:04.260 --> 01:25:08.770
I want to know is how many architects disagree with them and who's the better

1473
01:25:08.771 --> 01:25:11.080
architectures.
The video show me that but that's what I don't know.

1474
01:25:11.081 --> 01:25:14.470
I don't have the balls obvious.
This is,
we're talking about obvious shit.

1475
01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:19.400
I know you have to stay on the fence.
I know.
I know that dot.
Jude is not,

1476
01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:23.200
I have to,
I stay on the fence cause this is how I try to think.
I try to,

1477
01:25:23.201 --> 01:25:26.020
I try to not to look at the evidence,
the evidence.

1478
01:25:26.021 --> 01:25:29.140
I'm looking at it like some seven years I taught it would come out with a report

1479
01:25:29.410 --> 01:25:31.150
and then they don't test for explosives.

1480
01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:34.420
I thought that when we were looking at that a report,

1481
01:25:34.450 --> 01:25:37.710
I thought we're going to see the CIA in there.
It's less impressive with uh,

1482
01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:41.110
what we,
what we did have in there.
I don't know if they would be,

1483
01:25:41.111 --> 01:25:43.240
that's not every rate.
It might very well could be.

1484
01:25:43.330 --> 01:25:47.020
I don't know if they would rig a building like that with explosives when they

1485
01:25:47.021 --> 01:25:51.340
were building it in the possibility that something went wrong and they had to

1486
01:25:51.341 --> 01:25:55.090
destroy evidence.
No,
that is no,
but there could be positive and said that,

1487
01:25:55.091 --> 01:25:55.600
and you're,
you're,

1488
01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:58.960
you can't even bring that up because no one that has never been brought up.

1489
01:25:58.961 --> 01:26:03.680
But wait a minute.
That's what happened.
If the building exploded,
okay,
if you did,

1490
01:26:03.681 --> 01:26:04.070
if you do

1491
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:07.460
<v 4>believe that the building was a controlled demolition,
then someone rigged it.</v>

1492
01:26:07.850 --> 01:26:10.760
So the idea is if they knew that these people are going to be in this building,

1493
01:26:10.761 --> 01:26:13.640
they knew this building was going to be a high seek,
a high security building.

1494
01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:16.850
They could have rigged it with explosives when they were constructing it to make

1495
01:26:16.851 --> 01:26:18.990
sure that in event the building was taken.

1496
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:22.790
Why he said that didn't happen because when did it get detonated?

1497
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:25.560
When did it get,
when did it get fit?

1498
01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:28.520
But when it did get fitted with those explosives were just six weeks.

1499
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.630
That's what I'm saying.
What I'm saying is there are,
there's,

1500
01:26:31.730 --> 01:26:32.840
it's not my idea either.

1501
01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:35.660
This many people that are speculating that when the building was actually

1502
01:26:35.661 --> 01:26:39.710
constructed,
they constructed it with this possibility.
They made it.
Why you say,

1503
01:26:39.711 --> 01:26:42.800
no,
no.
Why do you say no?
When you look at the whole story,

1504
01:26:42.801 --> 01:26:46.040
I'm only bringing up tower seven,
but there's a million pieces to the store.

1505
01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:48.830
When you put all the pieces together,
you're like,
well,

1506
01:26:48.831 --> 01:26:50.840
it's just one part of building.
Why do you,

1507
01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:52.640
why are you convinced that that's how the building,
I brought it out.

1508
01:26:52.641 --> 01:26:57.110
What does it say?
The Department of Defense is Central Intelligence Agency.
Okay.

1509
01:26:57.140 --> 01:27:00.500
Yeah.
They shared the 25th for the IRS.
Okay.
Yeah,
that's it.

1510
01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:03.920
[inaudible] hold on.
This is,
we're just reading this,
the facts.

1511
01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:08.000
So the Department of Defense and the Central Intelligence Agency were there on

1512
01:27:08.001 --> 01:27:10.610
the 25th for,
with the IRS floors,

1513
01:27:10.611 --> 01:27:14.990
46 three 47 where mechanical floors as were the bottom floors and part of the

1514
01:27:14.991 --> 01:27:19.040
seventh floor.
Okay.
And that could all be bullshit.
That who knows,

1515
01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:23.260
that could just be someone just fucking around.
That's Wikipedia,
Bro Lock.

1516
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:26.990
Where did that come?
That is locked down and tight.

1517
01:27:27.410 --> 01:27:30.950
But why would you think that it's an impossible for them to rig the building

1518
01:27:30.951 --> 01:27:32.120
with explicitly construct?

1519
01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:37.140
It's impossible because they didn't say anything for seven years after public

1520
01:27:40.851 --> 01:27:44.810
pressure that we're forced to have put a scientist out there in front of these

1521
01:27:44.811 --> 01:27:46.880
reporters to finally give a reason.

1522
01:27:47.150 --> 01:27:51.620
And they said it was because of fires they didn't,
I understand.
And the gas,

1523
01:27:51.621 --> 01:27:55.000
why didn't you acts Chet for explosives?
You just,

1524
01:27:55.001 --> 01:27:58.100
this is what it was all of us three times to get it.
I got to get it.

1525
01:27:58.101 --> 01:27:59.870
But that's not,
that doesn't mean it's impossible.

1526
01:28:00.530 --> 01:28:02.720
I'm just looking at the evidence,
but that's not even the evidence.

1527
01:28:02.721 --> 01:28:05.840
It doesn't mean that it's impossible.
If,
if if was a controlled demolition,

1528
01:28:05.841 --> 01:28:09.610
let's get crazy and alien could have blew it up.
That's not impossible.

1529
01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:12.500
Let's say it.
Let's look at it and say it controlled demolition.

1530
01:28:12.530 --> 01:28:15.860
Let's say it looks like in controlled demolition.
Let's assume it is.
How did the,

1531
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:18.740
how did the bombs get into the building?
How did they put him in?

1532
01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:23.540
Why is it impossible?
If you look into,
if you wait,
you ask him a question.

1533
01:28:23.541 --> 01:28:27.800
Why is it impossible that they put those bombs in it when they were building it

1534
01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:32.450
in the case or when the secret service took over or when whoever was made the

1535
01:28:32.451 --> 01:28:32.781
tenant,

1536
01:28:32.781 --> 01:28:37.010
maybe they installed the bombs to make sure in an event that something happened.

1537
01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:41.210
Like in 96 I believe it was 96 the World Trade Center towers,

1538
01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:42.920
they blew them up in the basement.

1539
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:46.160
Remember they had a car bomb that went off in the base when they thought they

1540
01:28:46.161 --> 01:28:47.150
were gonna take the tower down.

1541
01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:52.340
If these people thought that put this building in place or that took over this

1542
01:28:52.341 --> 01:28:55.190
building,
the CIA,
the NSA,
whoever the fuck it was,

1543
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:59.120
if they knew that they had some really important secure information there,

1544
01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:02.040
it's very possible.
Could have said,
okay,

1545
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:04.710
<v 1>in the event that someone does blow up the World Trade Center,</v>

1546
01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:08.370
like in [inaudible] 96 because it's already happened before and a catastrophic

1547
01:29:08.371 --> 01:29:13.160
failure we can dump,
we can demolish this building a,
if you're a view wanted,

1548
01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:18.180
if you want us,
uh,
lean towards that theory,
that's fine too.

1549
01:29:18.450 --> 01:29:20.970
I'm not trying to lean in towards anything,
but why are you saying that?

1550
01:29:20.971 --> 01:29:23.910
That's impossible.
Anything's possible.
I wasn't there.
You weren't there,

1551
01:29:23.980 --> 01:29:26.850
but we're going based on what we know Jurors d w like,

1552
01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:30.930
like if this was the jury finding,
we're not looking for God's truth.

1553
01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:35.280
We're looking like a jury,
like a detective.
How would they handle the truth?

1554
01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:38.130
You know what I mean?
If everybody was legit,
you got to look at it like that.

1555
01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:40.710
What do you think happened if you think it was a controlled demolition?

1556
01:29:40.711 --> 01:29:44.280
How do you think mom's got in the building?
It's so deep.

1557
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:48.690
It's so deep and so long.
Like I said,
you put all of that nine 11 information.

1558
01:29:48.810 --> 01:29:50.070
Forget about the Pentagon.

1559
01:29:50.310 --> 01:29:52.980
This five hour documentary has nothing to do with the Pentagon.

1560
01:29:52.981 --> 01:29:54.420
That's like so much info.

1561
01:29:54.421 --> 01:29:58.320
Just like that video you showed five hours of that crushing evidence.

1562
01:29:58.620 --> 01:30:01.620
You look at that as a Jew or as a detective,
you're like,

1563
01:30:01.621 --> 01:30:04.500
of course it was an inside job.
He in that documentary,

1564
01:30:04.501 --> 01:30:07.170
they lay out the countries that have always done shit like this.

1565
01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:10.510
They've always done it that day.
They got busted in Iran contract.
But let's,

1566
01:30:10.511 --> 01:30:11.880
let's knock it off course here.
I want to,

1567
01:30:11.881 --> 01:30:14.580
I still want to find out you thinking on the building seven,

1568
01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:18.180
cause you're convinced the building seven one's a demolition,
right?
As a juror.

1569
01:30:18.420 --> 01:30:20.670
It's a demolition based on all the testimony.

1570
01:30:20.671 --> 01:30:24.500
How do you think they set it up for demolition?
Well,
uh,
there,
uh,

1571
01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:28.290
there's evidence if you watching this documentary just so much information,

1572
01:30:28.291 --> 01:30:29.610
but there's evidence of,

1573
01:30:29.850 --> 01:30:34.850
of them constantly doing work and fake ass workers working on the elevator

1574
01:30:35.251 --> 01:30:39.810
shafts.
There's all this evidence of that.
They can,
they,
it's so deep.

1575
01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:40.800
I don't want to,

1576
01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:45.360
I don't remember the names of the guys are all these people that were working

1577
01:30:45.361 --> 01:30:47.610
there.
They just set that building up to blow up.
Yeah.

1578
01:30:47.611 --> 01:30:50.730
They took time and they just had fake fake,
uh,
the,

1579
01:30:50.731 --> 01:30:54.540
it's a fact that the elevator was always broken and there was always people like

1580
01:30:54.541 --> 01:30:55.500
the month before,

1581
01:30:55.740 --> 01:30:59.130
there's all these fake passes and there's a lot of evidence is five hours,

1582
01:30:59.340 --> 01:31:03.460
you're going to go,
shit,
there's report is kind of,
there's all the bravo.
Yeah.

1583
01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:08.400
Yeah.
But you know what?
I'm so obsessed with those details.

1584
01:31:08.490 --> 01:31:12.690
I don't know why,
but I,
we're living in a world post nine 11.
That's,

1585
01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:16.950
we're living in a crazy world where people are fucking dying in the Middle East

1586
01:31:16.951 --> 01:31:19.980
and getting blown up and getting murdered and kids and stuff like that that's

1587
01:31:19.981 --> 01:31:24.480
going on.
I just can't,
I need to find out why they're doing like,
what's going on.

1588
01:31:24.481 --> 01:31:28.860
I just,
I'm obsessed with,
well,
how is this racket?
How do they operate?

1589
01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:32.430
I want to know the truth.
And when you know the truth,
it's just like,
fuck.

1590
01:31:32.431 --> 01:31:35.760
You just want to tell as many people as possible.
We're this,
look,

1591
01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:41.510
George Bush,
a singer gets busted Nash on national TV,
uh,

1592
01:31:41.610 --> 01:31:44.550
with the Iran Contra,
uh,
situation.

1593
01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:49.700
He becomes president after that and then he's running all his shit and all this

1594
01:31:49.911 --> 01:31:54.911
drugs in his arms through Arkansas with an unknown governor who Bill Clinton,

1595
01:31:56.461 --> 01:31:57.570
who's letting it happen.

1596
01:31:57.690 --> 01:32:01.990
And then he becomes President George Bush as a detective.

1597
01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:03.760
I don't know the truth.
I wasn't there.

1598
01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:07.930
I don't know what the relationship looks like.
I'm like,
I'm like,
that's a,

1599
01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:10.390
that's a fucking,
that's some gangster shit going on right there.

1600
01:32:10.391 --> 01:32:11.820
And they're just playing with the public and all the,

1601
01:32:11.970 --> 01:32:14.800
the dumb motherfuckers who believed that there's,
you know,

1602
01:32:14.910 --> 01:32:19.450
this Republican Democrat,
a battle going on,
you know,
that's,

1603
01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:20.350
it's,

1604
01:32:20.350 --> 01:32:25.030
it's a fascinating and frustrating at the same time and very scary that man,

1605
01:32:25.031 --> 01:32:29.080
we're living with people there that just follow the official story and whatever

1606
01:32:29.081 --> 01:32:32.680
they say,
that's the truth and all the other shit that's not that this stuff,

1607
01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:34.680
that's crazy when they,

1608
01:32:34.690 --> 01:32:38.260
a lot of people that do really love to bar the official store and they love to

1609
01:32:38.261 --> 01:32:42.160
argue it.
They love to argue the official story.
Yeah.
The scary thing is Pete,

1610
01:32:42.161 --> 01:32:46.510
the people,
when you ask anybody,
they'll say,
yeah,
the government's fucked.

1611
01:32:46.750 --> 01:32:49.990
Fucked up.
Yeah.
The government,
you can't trust the government.

1612
01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:53.230
Everybody would say that.
Everyone,
everyone,
no one's ever,
no one's ever said,

1613
01:32:53.231 --> 01:32:55.570
you can totally trust the government.
I trust the government.

1614
01:32:55.571 --> 01:32:58.090
No one ever says that ever.
They,
oh,

1615
01:32:58.110 --> 01:33:00.250
everyone says I fuck the government bunch of crooks.

1616
01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:04.450
But when when they get busted and there's all this evidence and all shake gone

1617
01:33:04.451 --> 01:33:08.910
to shit going down and it's so crystal clear.
Can you imagine if those,

1618
01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:13.240
the video of not of tower seven was not available until 10 years later?

1619
01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:14.140
No,

1620
01:33:14.140 --> 01:33:19.120
that would be the craziest fucking a conspiracy theory that nobody would get

1621
01:33:19.121 --> 01:33:21.940
behind.
Nobody would waste their time.
That building goes down.

1622
01:33:21.941 --> 01:33:24.340
There's no video of it.
There's going to be people that were there.
It's like,

1623
01:33:24.341 --> 01:33:29.050
dude,
it's a crazy bill.
Some tower seven just fell down like,
like,
like,

1624
01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:32.770
like it was controlled demo.
People call you crazy mother.
Fuck,
where's the video?

1625
01:33:32.860 --> 01:33:35.080
Where's the video?
Where's the video?
That's all they would know.

1626
01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:37.410
Didn't say what happened with the Kennedy assassination.
Exactly.

1627
01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:39.220
That was 10 years later.
So with,

1628
01:33:39.221 --> 01:33:43.840
can you imagine if there was no video because of all the angles that came out

1629
01:33:43.841 --> 01:33:46.150
right away.
Right away.
We had all that footage.

1630
01:33:46.450 --> 01:33:51.450
It's almost like it like that was good for the people that were behind this.

1631
01:33:51.851 --> 01:33:54.340
Like it was beautiful cause you could see that on youtube and has millions of

1632
01:33:54.341 --> 01:33:57.520
views,
but people will go,
well the government said it was fires,

1633
01:33:57.580 --> 01:34:01.180
so I believe it's fires.
Hmm.
You know,
I mean you're watching it,

1634
01:34:01.450 --> 01:34:03.550
you're watching it go down a bunch of different angles.

1635
01:34:03.551 --> 01:34:08.350
But I'm going to go with the government on this one government per 200 that

1636
01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:10.960
scary.
That kind of mentality is what I'm scared of.

1637
01:34:11.770 --> 01:34:13.300
I'm scared of the conspiracy theories.

1638
01:34:16.290 --> 01:34:21.070
That shit,
I hate this fucking joint.
You here's killing my brain.

1639
01:34:21.071 --> 01:34:25.180
I've got to go to Australia,
Bro.
I can't handle it now.
Crazy shit man.

1640
01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:27.850
Maybe I,

1641
01:34:27.850 --> 01:34:32.430
maybe I should just say shut the fuck up about it and just close my fucking eyes

1642
01:34:32.431 --> 01:34:35.300
just looked straight.
Sometimes I think about that.
You know,
I wonder,

1643
01:34:35.570 --> 01:34:40.540
I wonder how long if,
if there really is some crazy global cabal going on.

1644
01:34:40.541 --> 01:34:42.460
It's ripping off the world how much longer they,

1645
01:34:42.461 --> 01:34:46.150
and they keep going with this and this these days of Edward Snowden.

1646
01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:49.340
You know what?
There's,
there's hope,
information leaks when,

1647
01:34:49.810 --> 01:34:53.860
when you find out exactly how the racket and works,
the global racket works,

1648
01:34:53.861 --> 01:34:57.950
when you look into it with an open mind.
And I mean

1649
01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:00.040
<v 4>we just went right back into it.
We're going to get out of it.</v>

1650
01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:05.330
I didn't know what I was going to say.
Me.
What were we even talking about?

1651
01:35:05.331 --> 01:35:09.950
Global Cabal.
Look how it works.
If you look at how it works,
man,

1652
01:35:09.951 --> 01:35:14.420
I totally forgot.
I taught global Kabbalah.
We'll just figure this out.

1653
01:35:14.660 --> 01:35:18.650
Global Cobol and what else?
I'm going to go with tower seven,
chem trail,

1654
01:35:18.651 --> 01:35:23.260
black helicopter,
CIA,
George Bush.
I remember,

1655
01:35:23.330 --> 01:35:24.190
I remember he seals

1656
01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:28.950
<v 1>when you look at it,
how it all goes down and bit by bit how it all goes down.</v>

1657
01:35:28.951 --> 01:35:31.350
It's like fucking nuts.
It's nuts.

1658
01:35:31.470 --> 01:35:35.480
And I think there's no way we could ever,
uh,

1659
01:35:35.481 --> 01:35:38.520
regain control of the media because that's where all the power is.

1660
01:35:38.521 --> 01:35:42.540
It all comes down to the media.
Who controls that shit?
And,
uh,

1661
01:35:42.541 --> 01:35:44.790
when you do we ever have control,

1662
01:35:44.791 --> 01:35:46.710
we got to go to alternative media for the truth.
And,

1663
01:35:46.711 --> 01:35:47.640
but then no one believes that.

1664
01:35:47.641 --> 01:35:50.160
Everyone believes that the shit that the government gives us,

1665
01:35:50.161 --> 01:35:53.430
the PR pro fucking propaganda machine from Pentagon.

1666
01:35:53.730 --> 01:35:56.820
Everyone believes that they don't believe the alternative media because,
Oh,

1667
01:35:56.821 --> 01:35:58.830
you know what?
It looks like it was low budget.

1668
01:35:58.831 --> 01:36:00.840
Cause look at the kind of film and the lighting they use.
It doesn't,

1669
01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:02.760
I don't believe that that looks like they're in the garage.

1670
01:36:02.820 --> 01:36:05.400
I want to believe this shit on Fox.
That's how people think.

1671
01:36:05.790 --> 01:36:06.571
They might not say that,

1672
01:36:06.571 --> 01:36:08.880
but that's what's going on because that's what people believe.

1673
01:36:08.881 --> 01:36:09.660
Most of people think,

1674
01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:13.470
<v 4>but as the news as a shittier and Shittier job of covering events in detail,</v>

1675
01:36:13.471 --> 01:36:16.480
I think people are leaning more and more towards alternative sources.
Yes.

1676
01:36:16.570 --> 01:36:20.960
It's like the Guardian when they released all those Ed Snowden documents that

1677
01:36:20.970 --> 01:36:24.420
they weren't the only ones who were offered that.
Yeah.
It's just they got lucky.

1678
01:36:24.421 --> 01:36:28.980
They found a guy in Glenn Greenwald wanting to put his balls out there and do it

1679
01:36:28.981 --> 01:36:32.570
and then they go after whistle blowers.
Man.
John Stott

1680
01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:35.570
<v 1>well is a former CIA agent,
wrote a couple books,</v>

1681
01:36:35.571 --> 01:36:39.110
CIA to control the royalties of his books because you can't be talking about

1682
01:36:39.111 --> 01:36:41.360
this stuff,
so he's not making money off the puts.
The CIS,

1683
01:36:41.361 --> 01:36:43.790
they just took control of his shed.
It's John Stockwell.

1684
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:47.750
He was a CIA agent for 13 years.
Most of the people in the CIA,

1685
01:36:47.751 --> 01:36:50.330
they come in to fight communism.
They're trying to help the world.

1686
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:54.230
They're trying to help the United States.
It's the criminal element.

1687
01:36:54.231 --> 01:36:57.050
There's a few key players.
The guys with all the power at the top,

1688
01:36:57.051 --> 01:37:00.980
the craziest guys at the top and a lot of guys in the sea.
I have no idea.

1689
01:37:00.981 --> 01:37:01.870
They don't tell anyone.
Everybody.

1690
01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:05.430
<v 4>I think it's like what you were saying earlier that we were talking about how in</v>

1691
01:37:05.431 --> 01:37:09.570
the 1980s and whatever before the Internet there was only a few different

1692
01:37:09.571 --> 01:37:11.520
programs to everybody was on these channels,

1693
01:37:11.940 --> 01:37:15.870
but I think in this day and age there's so much information out there.

1694
01:37:15.871 --> 01:37:18.480
There's so much stuff to listen to it so much stuff to watch,

1695
01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:19.740
so much stuff to pay attention to.

1696
01:37:19.741 --> 01:37:23.430
It's just overwhelming that when something happens,
even if it's a big deal,

1697
01:37:23.790 --> 01:37:26.910
it's gone a couple of days,
just some new shit coming down the pipe.

1698
01:37:26.911 --> 01:37:31.260
University in Missouri,
they're having a fucking hunger strike.
Oh,
that lady,

1699
01:37:31.261 --> 01:37:34.250
she pushed that kid and she called for muscle.
Like the,

1700
01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:36.330
there's a new thing every God damn day.
You know,

1701
01:37:36.331 --> 01:37:41.040
a few days ago the Pentagon got busted with a gas station that cost $43 million

1702
01:37:41.041 --> 01:37:42.930
to build.
And everyone is like,

1703
01:37:42.931 --> 01:37:46.650
why is the gas station that part of the world is normally full of between 200

1704
01:37:46.651 --> 01:37:50.970
and $500,000 to build a gas station 43 million.
And they're like,
it just is.

1705
01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:54.840
It's fucking expensive.
I mean,
even the latest word out there,
I,
Donald Rumsfeld,

1706
01:37:54.841 --> 01:37:55.990
the day nine 11 set,

1707
01:37:55.990 --> 01:38:00.320
<v 1>oh yeah,
we have two point $3 trillion missing.
It's ridiculous,
right?</v>

1708
01:38:00.321 --> 01:38:02.880
It just says we don't know where it's at,
but it's gone.

1709
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:08.000
So they had to make a fucking Pentagon briefing that a data tell the world,

1710
01:38:08.041 --> 01:38:11.280
listen,
we lost two point 3 trillion.
The number 10.
Yeah.

1711
01:38:11.281 --> 01:38:12.960
That was September 10th and the next day,
uh,

1712
01:38:13.230 --> 01:38:17.160
that office in the Pentagon is looking into.
It blows up.
But anyways,
as a,

1713
01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:21.090
as a juror,
I'm,
I'm like gangsters.

1714
01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:26.120
Gangster Shit's going on right here.
Did I don't have to.
I'm not fucking a,
I'm,

1715
01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:30.150
I'm a grown ass man.
I know how gangsters they are.
I'm like,
that's dude.

1716
01:38:30.630 --> 01:38:33.730
It's obvious.
Yes.
Right.
So,
but the hope you,

1717
01:38:33.731 --> 01:38:36.540
you think there's no hope because they control the media.
They got it.

1718
01:38:36.750 --> 01:38:41.130
But what shows me hope is what's happening with hemp and marijuana.

1719
01:38:41.310 --> 01:38:44.610
The Resurgens taken a schedule,
one drug,
a schedule one drug,

1720
01:38:44.611 --> 01:38:49.610
and making it legal that,
that several states,
including Washington DC,

1721
01:38:49.690 --> 01:38:52.680
which is crazy.
It's more and more and more it's becoming legal.

1722
01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:57.240
So that shows that the federal government doesn't,
they still schedule it.
One,

1723
01:38:57.241 --> 01:39:01.950
they,
they didn't want this.
But that shows that the people actually ultimately,

1724
01:39:02.010 --> 01:39:03.510
if the people all can get together,

1725
01:39:03.630 --> 01:39:06.540
they do have all the power that people do have the power,

1726
01:39:06.541 --> 01:39:08.610
because we still remember that from the constitution.

1727
01:39:08.850 --> 01:39:10.340
That's one thing we remember.
We,

1728
01:39:10.590 --> 01:39:12.720
I don't remember a fucking amendments and all that,
but I go,

1729
01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:16.320
I know we have the power and you guys supposed to be working for us right now.

1730
01:39:16.321 --> 01:39:17.880
It's not like that and it's fucked up.

1731
01:39:18.090 --> 01:39:19.800
But we know we're supposed to have the power.

1732
01:39:19.860 --> 01:39:23.160
And when we learned that and we learned how powerful we are,
we took a schedule,

1733
01:39:23.161 --> 01:39:27.960
one drug that was demonized,
that was persecuted.
It wasn't just left by itself.

1734
01:39:28.230 --> 01:39:32.280
They went after the psyche of the nation on globally.

1735
01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:35.430
Really not just nationally.
That was real.
That's not a conspiracy theory.

1736
01:39:35.431 --> 01:39:39.240
The reefer mapper Maddis propaganda,
that some evil shit.
So when people tell me,

1737
01:39:39.270 --> 01:39:41.790
Oh,
do you know there's parts of the government that do this?

1738
01:39:42.030 --> 01:39:45.420
I don't need fucking evidence.
You could tell him anything.
I'm like,

1739
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:49.020
it's probably true.
And if it's not true,
who gives a fuck anyways,

1740
01:39:49.021 --> 01:39:50.070
but I believe it.

1741
01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:54.150
You're talking about criminals is a criminal activity and does it seem like,
oh,

1742
01:39:54.151 --> 01:39:55.860
you can make money that way.
Whatever you're telling me,

1743
01:39:55.950 --> 01:39:58.800
I see where the money comes from.
If I don't see where the money comes from,

1744
01:39:58.801 --> 01:40:01.430
Michael,
maybe it's bullshit.
But if you could see how they could make money,

1745
01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:03.840
they probably do it.
Cause if you just thought of it,

1746
01:40:03.841 --> 01:40:08.580
they probably thought of it to the run and everything.
So,
um,
but there's hope,

1747
01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:12.930
there's hope and my shit that people do have the fucking power box.

1748
01:40:13.210 --> 01:40:15.890
We can make a different position.
Their position when they,
they can

1749
01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:17.760
<v 4>lock people up when they're going to intimidate people.</v>

1750
01:40:17.761 --> 01:40:21.270
The threat of locking people up for something as silly as marijuana.

1751
01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:25.050
I mean people will say,
well that's,
you know,
it's not even an important point.

1752
01:40:25.051 --> 01:40:28.670
It's under.
I remember when Obama said there was a,
there was some sort of,
uh,

1753
01:40:28.780 --> 01:40:32.250
of writing on the Internet.
Like what should,
what should they talk about?

1754
01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:35.430
And I forget what speech he was given.
What would a town hall,

1755
01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:37.230
what was the number one question?
And he's like,

1756
01:40:37.770 --> 01:40:41.160
the number one question was legalization of marijuana.
And he was like,

1757
01:40:41.180 --> 01:40:44.610
[inaudible] what that says about the people that are calling in and haul,

1758
01:40:44.820 --> 01:40:47.760
you know,
he jokes around about it.
Like it's not,
it's not a,
you know,

1759
01:40:47.970 --> 01:40:52.560
a serious topic.
But of course it's serious topic because marijuana by itself,

1760
01:40:52.650 --> 01:40:55.330
whether you pot or don't like pot,
it's not about that.

1761
01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:58.810
It's about freedom and it's a serious topic.

1762
01:40:58.811 --> 01:41:01.210
When you have a subject like marijuana,

1763
01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:05.710
which all these people enjoy and there's no reason why it should be illegal and

1764
01:41:05.711 --> 01:41:08.380
yet it's still illegal.
That's not freedom.
See,

1765
01:41:08.381 --> 01:41:13.090
if marijuana made people's fucking brains melt and made your Dick fall off and

1766
01:41:13.091 --> 01:41:15.220
you know,
made people just start running out into traffic,

1767
01:41:15.250 --> 01:41:18.070
there would be a reason why someone would say,
hey,

1768
01:41:18.071 --> 01:41:20.560
we got to spend a lot of money to stop this because it's going to destroy our

1769
01:41:20.561 --> 01:41:23.260
youth,
ruin our children,
just devastate our society.

1770
01:41:23.410 --> 01:41:26.170
Since that evidence doesn't exist,
it doesn't make any sense.

1771
01:41:26.171 --> 01:41:29.230
So if someone is still arresting people when there's no evidence that they

1772
01:41:29.231 --> 01:41:33.310
should be,
that's when shit gets scary.
That's scary.

1773
01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:36.670
That's a freedom issue because they're letting you know they can just lock you

1774
01:41:36.671 --> 01:41:38.620
in a cage.
We have a difference of opinion.

1775
01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:40.780
I'm not even willing to look at scientific evidence.

1776
01:41:40.930 --> 01:41:42.550
I don't care about scientific evidence.

1777
01:41:42.730 --> 01:41:45.730
I care about what's written on this piece of paper.
And this piece of paper says,

1778
01:41:45.731 --> 01:41:48.400
if you're stuck,
if you have a certain amount of these plants,

1779
01:41:48.490 --> 01:41:51.910
I can put you in a cage and I can make money off of you being in that fucking

1780
01:41:51.911 --> 01:41:54.370
cage.
That is a freedom issue.

1781
01:41:54.371 --> 01:41:58.690
It has nothing to do with marijuana itself or you and I are obviously marijuana

1782
01:41:58.691 --> 01:42:03.691
advocates and were marijuana enthusiasts and we're known for having beliefs that

1783
01:42:04.631 --> 01:42:07.510
marijuana is not just a,
it's not just a fun thing,

1784
01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:10.000
but it's a very important thing for creativity.

1785
01:42:10.001 --> 01:42:12.440
It's like a turbocharger for creativity.
Absolutely,

1786
01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:16.030
and it doesn't get recognized for what it is because it's been demonized and so

1787
01:42:16.031 --> 01:42:18.940
it's not about whether or not you should start doing it or other people should

1788
01:42:18.941 --> 01:42:22.300
start having our our opinions and and changing your mind on it.

1789
01:42:22.570 --> 01:42:26.290
It's about recognizing why we have these opinions in the first place because

1790
01:42:26.291 --> 01:42:28.360
they're not based on fact at all.

1791
01:42:28.510 --> 01:42:33.510
These are 1930s propaganda ideas that were at the time fucking tsunamis,

1792
01:42:35.470 --> 01:42:38.800
right?
Tsunamis of information back when there was so few portals,

1793
01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:40.810
they put a movie like reefer madness out.

1794
01:42:41.170 --> 01:42:43.600
William Randolph Hearst is the guy running the newspaper is,

1795
01:42:43.601 --> 01:42:47.050
he's got all these stories he's printing about Mexicans and black people raping

1796
01:42:47.051 --> 01:42:50.740
white people.
When those were the only fucking voices on the horizon,

1797
01:42:50.860 --> 01:42:53.440
people freaked out about any kind of information like that.

1798
01:42:53.441 --> 01:42:55.870
That was all that was available.
It wasn't like that.

1799
01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:59.140
And then you'd go online and Mike Tyson fucked a tiger.
What?
You know,

1800
01:42:59.141 --> 01:43:02.740
or you know Dan Ariens billion dollars playing poker.

1801
01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:07.910
What do you suppose they went after marijuana and are just a demonic way?

1802
01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:08.411
Well,

1803
01:43:08.411 --> 01:43:13.411
I think it was gone after in a very calculated way by a guy who went after a lot

1804
01:43:13.841 --> 01:43:14.620
of things like that.

1805
01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:18.280
William brand offers stand to profit from marijuana being illegal,

1806
01:43:18.281 --> 01:43:19.720
remaining illegal.
He,
in fact,

1807
01:43:19.721 --> 01:43:22.450
they named it marijuana for people don't even know the name.

1808
01:43:22.451 --> 01:43:27.130
Marijuana referred to a wild Mexican tobacco and it had nothing to do with

1809
01:43:27.131 --> 01:43:27.731
cannabis.

1810
01:43:27.731 --> 01:43:32.200
Cannabis was hemp and everybody knew that and they knew that as a textile and as

1811
01:43:32.201 --> 01:43:35.380
a commodity,
it was extremely valuable for the American people,

1812
01:43:35.650 --> 01:43:36.700
for people don't know.

1813
01:43:36.701 --> 01:43:41.500
There was actually a documentary that Jack Hara found and it was a big deal that

1814
01:43:41.501 --> 01:43:44.950
he found it because he had known about this and people denied its existence.

1815
01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:48.760
And then he found this documentary hemp for victory and it was made during World

1816
01:43:48.761 --> 01:43:52.220
War Two after hamp was essentially made,
but they wanted

1817
01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:57.020
<v 2>him to use for sales.
They used for canvas is all made with hemp.</v>

1818
01:43:57.260 --> 01:44:01.520
All the,
the great paintings like the Mona Lisa that she has painted on canvas,

1819
01:44:01.610 --> 01:44:02.900
which comes from cannabis,

1820
01:44:03.050 --> 01:44:06.500
I mean is it is a commonly used plant throughout human history.

1821
01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:08.300
Thousands of years of use,

1822
01:44:08.510 --> 01:44:12.950
all like intercepted by a propaganda campaign.

1823
01:44:13.190 --> 01:44:17.240
This propaganda campaign by one guy and a bunch of other people that conspired

1824
01:44:17.241 --> 01:44:20.240
with as well,
where there's two factions of it.

1825
01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:24.770
One guy wanted to do put up movies.
I,
William Randolph paid for that,

1826
01:44:24.771 --> 01:44:27.710
but he also owned Hearst publications.
He,
oh,
he owned the newspapers.

1827
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:32.830
So he printed these wild stories of white women getting raped by people smoking

1828
01:44:33.321 --> 01:44:38.180
marijuana.
He owned hundreds of like he owned,
not just newspaper,

1829
01:44:38.330 --> 01:44:43.330
but he owned hundreds of thousands of acres of trees and he used those trees and

1830
01:44:43.731 --> 01:44:45.710
made paper out of them.
He own paper mills.

1831
01:44:46.100 --> 01:44:50.930
If camp became the new billion dollar crop as it was predicted on the cover of

1832
01:44:50.931 --> 01:44:55.460
Popular Science magazine,
if that happened,
we end brand off hers would,

1833
01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:56.840
I mean he would have been fucked.

1834
01:44:56.840 --> 01:45:00.500
He would have to spend millions of dollars converting his newspapers to hemp

1835
01:45:00.501 --> 01:45:05.210
paper.
So he was like,
fuck it,
I'll just write evil shit about marijuana.

1836
01:45:05.300 --> 01:45:09.740
I'll just call it marijuana.
So wasn't even about going after the drug.

1837
01:45:09.980 --> 01:45:13.610
It was about going after the what the fibers of the plant do.

1838
01:45:13.670 --> 01:45:16.010
That's a conspiracy theory right there it is.

1839
01:45:16.220 --> 01:45:19.310
And can you imagine that was all during the 30s and forties.

1840
01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:23.130
He imagined that they had to be some people that were thought of as some tinfoil

1841
01:45:23.210 --> 01:45:28.210
hat wearing conspiracy theorists that are saying that we is actually not,

1842
01:45:28.461 --> 01:45:31.250
doesn't make you do all these crazy things that they're putting in the movies.

1843
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:33.770
And with all this reformat and propaganda,
there's people,

1844
01:45:33.950 --> 01:45:37.250
those people must have been a,
they looked so goddamn crazy,

1845
01:45:37.251 --> 01:45:39.390
but even today people try to debunk this.
I've,

1846
01:45:39.391 --> 01:45:41.750
I've people have said that to me and they sent me to a website,
dude,

1847
01:45:41.751 --> 01:45:45.620
that's been debunked.
Sorry,
my bunk that,
that William Randolph Hearst a,

1848
01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:49.190
it had set up marijuana for and worked with.
Um,

1849
01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:53.100
what was the guy's name?
Harry Harry Anslinger ads.
But it's an,

1850
01:45:53.101 --> 01:45:56.290
that hasn't been debunked.
Not only,
it hasn't not been debunked.
We am runoff.

1851
01:45:56.300 --> 01:45:59.240
Hearse was a notable cont.
Like everybody knew he was a con.

1852
01:45:59.570 --> 01:46:02.340
Orson Welles made a movie about it.
What a conti was back.

1853
01:46:02.420 --> 01:46:05.720
Who's protecting fucking William Randolph Hearst.
They just,

1854
01:46:05.721 --> 01:46:07.340
it's the same mentality.

1855
01:46:07.341 --> 01:46:10.020
It's the same mentality we're talking to people is the same,

1856
01:46:10.021 --> 01:46:15.021
I believe 100% of exactly 100% he Harvey Oswald acted Oh hundred percent hundred

1857
01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:20.680
percent I'm 100% for 100% the Lee Harvey Oswald was going with it.

1858
01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:24.100
They would never lie.
Well people,
you know,
it's,

1859
01:46:24.110 --> 01:46:27.680
it's hard because some people automatically gravitate towards conspiracies.

1860
01:46:27.770 --> 01:46:31.880
Some people automatically gravitate towards when they're criminals towards the

1861
01:46:31.881 --> 01:46:35.010
official story.
But I think a lot of times the stories,

1862
01:46:35.210 --> 01:46:37.190
the reality somewhere in the middle,
and it's,

1863
01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:40.070
it's hard to find the reality depending on the conspiracy theory.

1864
01:46:40.070 --> 01:46:43.760
You can't say that about it.
That's true.
Nine 11 there's so,
there's so much shit.

1865
01:46:44.060 --> 01:46:47.840
And like I said,
people think however crazy they think it is.

1866
01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:52.500
Iran Contra was justice craze.
Everyone thought that was real and it got busted.

1867
01:46:52.501 --> 01:46:54.480
They got the balls to,
we ran our first thing.
Here's why.

1868
01:46:54.481 --> 01:46:57.240
It really can't be totally debunked.
First of all,
we don't really know.

1869
01:46:57.360 --> 01:46:59.280
We weren't there.
So it's,
it's,

1870
01:46:59.300 --> 01:47:02.000
it's very difficult to prove and it's very difficult to dip disproof.

1871
01:47:02.010 --> 01:47:02.940
But one thing we do know,

1872
01:47:02.941 --> 01:47:07.340
he definitely did print stories about this drug that everyone was terrified off.

1873
01:47:07.370 --> 01:47:10.800
Yeah,
he definitely did contribute to the making of reefer madness.

1874
01:47:10.801 --> 01:47:13.520
I'm almost positive of that.
Okay.

1875
01:47:13.730 --> 01:47:16.710
Find Out William Randolph first had anything to do with the funding of the movie

1876
01:47:16.711 --> 01:47:20.200
reefer madness.
We need a memo where he all okays that story.
Yeah,

1877
01:47:20.620 --> 01:47:22.190
he signed off on it.
But here's the other,

1878
01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:25.350
the other aspect of it that we even talk about this,

1879
01:47:25.351 --> 01:47:28.830
the timing of this is right after prohibition ended,

1880
01:47:28.890 --> 01:47:33.120
so prohibition was a boon to law enforcement.
They were constantly working,

1881
01:47:33.121 --> 01:47:36.180
they were arresting people,
locking people up,
and then on top of that,

1882
01:47:36.181 --> 01:47:39.390
organized crime emerges in a huge way.
I mean,

1883
01:47:39.391 --> 01:47:41.190
that's where Al Capone got all his money.

1884
01:47:41.310 --> 01:47:43.440
That's where the Kennedy's got their fucking money.
Also,

1885
01:47:43.441 --> 01:47:45.210
it's all from run and booze,
man.

1886
01:47:45.420 --> 01:47:48.840
So there's all these people that are illegally run in booze and then making

1887
01:47:48.841 --> 01:47:52.260
crazy money and they wind up in positions of power and even wind up having their

1888
01:47:52.261 --> 01:47:53.820
fucking children's become president.

1889
01:47:53.970 --> 01:47:57.270
That's the real story of the United States is at Kennedy's fucking parents were

1890
01:47:57.271 --> 01:48:00.150
drug runners.
They're drug was just a liquid drug.

1891
01:48:00.330 --> 01:48:03.590
It's just as just the same as running coke,
just the same as,

1892
01:48:03.591 --> 01:48:06.780
as grown weed right now today.
Not Criminals.
It's all,

1893
01:48:07.020 --> 01:48:09.930
and JFK and his brother Robert,
they,

1894
01:48:09.931 --> 01:48:12.990
something turned them and they decided they're going to try and save the world,

1895
01:48:13.470 --> 01:48:18.330
maybe terming trust them because one thing's for sure,
he was an extreme.

1896
01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:20.070
He was like Bill Clinton when it came to girls.

1897
01:48:20.430 --> 01:48:22.320
They thought they had him in the bag.
They thought he wouldn't,

1898
01:48:22.830 --> 01:48:27.720
he totally just stay in line and uh,
they had to get rid of him.
Everybody.

1899
01:48:27.721 --> 01:48:29.040
So they,
that's interesting.

1900
01:48:29.041 --> 01:48:32.130
So they'd probably like have a guide like that to get them in the office and go

1901
01:48:32.131 --> 01:48:36.690
listen to,
we know you're a freak.
Okay.
Fuck as many as you want.
We'll,
we'll keep,

1902
01:48:36.691 --> 01:48:38.880
we'll keep you protected or you know,

1903
01:48:38.881 --> 01:48:43.280
Shit's going to get ugly sign a couple bills,
a little trade agreement.
Big Deal.

1904
01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:45.720
We're going to up in the Congo side.
Just you could do it.

1905
01:48:45.721 --> 01:48:49.440
A little trade agreement with Mexico and all that,
but it's very,
who knows?
It's,

1906
01:48:49.441 --> 01:48:52.680
it's very intriguing when you start looking at possibilities like that because

1907
01:48:52.681 --> 01:48:56.850
it comes from a criminal family.
So you know,
it's very obvious.

1908
01:48:56.851 --> 01:48:58.470
They're all gangsters.
He,
they,
they turn,

1909
01:48:58.471 --> 01:49:01.140
they tried to change the world and then they had to get rid of them.

1910
01:49:01.141 --> 01:49:02.870
It's just like,
it's like,
you know,

1911
01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:06.060
so you've got an Easter one on one and then you've got the gangsters through the

1912
01:49:06.061 --> 01:49:09.480
police officers who are arresting people for Booze.
Okay.
Because let's be honest,

1913
01:49:09.481 --> 01:49:10.890
it's not the cops that are the gangsters,

1914
01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:13.890
but the people that are telling the cops where to go for sure gangsters.

1915
01:49:14.130 --> 01:49:17.010
Why are they telling him?
Why is it out in the first place?
Like,
who the fuck?

1916
01:49:17.250 --> 01:49:18.770
Who says you can't have whiskey?

1917
01:49:18.771 --> 01:49:21.750
Were what kind of bitches are we were supposed to be America.

1918
01:49:21.870 --> 01:49:24.900
Someone's gonna come along and say,
you can have a drink.
How about fuck you?

1919
01:49:25.050 --> 01:49:27.000
That doesn't make any sense.
You can't drink.

1920
01:49:27.100 --> 01:49:30.270
So I'm supposed to just live my life by your fucking wacky rules.

1921
01:49:30.450 --> 01:49:35.100
I'd like drinking is fun.
It's so much fun.
It should be illegal.

1922
01:49:35.180 --> 01:49:39.940
It should be.
I'd be all for it.
Making it illegal.
It'd be cool.
Drink it like uh,

1923
01:49:40.300 --> 01:49:44.880
uh,
back in the twenties or thirties,
an organized crime would be even bigger,
man.

1924
01:49:44.980 --> 01:49:48.640
Let's shift becomes dangerous.
Look,
they mean Jack on the corner.

1925
01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:51.490
Here's proof example.
Jack Daniels had been around forever,
right?

1926
01:49:51.491 --> 01:49:53.830
They sell whiskey super popular everywhere.

1927
01:49:53.870 --> 01:49:58.120
I drink Jack Daniels on a regular basis,
right?
That companies not evil,

1928
01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:03.400
not killing anybody.
Jack Daniels is in fucking gun people down the street.

1929
01:50:03.401 --> 01:50:05.620
Jack Daniels isn't taken over.
New Territory's.

1930
01:50:05.770 --> 01:50:09.880
Jack Daniels is in fucking Berlin and holes underneath prisons and digging

1931
01:50:09.881 --> 01:50:14.380
people out at home would,
but the corporation that owns Jack Daniels,

1932
01:50:14.381 --> 01:50:18.040
probably,
I don't know if the corporation is even Jack Daniels itself.

1933
01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:22.420
It might just be Jack Daniels distillery.
I don't know that shit over.

1934
01:50:22.820 --> 01:50:24.670
Come on cares.
Who Cares?

1935
01:50:24.671 --> 01:50:28.660
My point is that Jack Daniels isn't an evil company.
They can make money,

1936
01:50:29.020 --> 01:50:33.080
but if you can make money doing shit like that,
then there's less of a,

1937
01:50:33.081 --> 01:50:35.500
a criminal element to it.
It's a safe company.

1938
01:50:36.340 --> 01:50:39.580
There's a lot of bad shit they gets done by people were drunk on Jack Daniels

1939
01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:43.990
for sure,
but at Jack Daniel's,
the company is not like Al Capone.
That's my point.

1940
01:50:44.170 --> 01:50:47.950
It's like when you let the,
let companies sell things legally,

1941
01:50:48.070 --> 01:50:52.150
you get the tax benefit from it and the companies aren't filled with criminals

1942
01:50:52.270 --> 01:50:55.360
because the only people that are willing to run heroin are going to be crazy

1943
01:50:55.361 --> 01:50:58.120
fuckers like that guy from breaking bad.
That's going to be,

1944
01:50:58.121 --> 01:50:59.500
the people are going to be running heroin.

1945
01:50:59.501 --> 01:51:00.940
They're going to be out of their fucking mind.

1946
01:51:01.150 --> 01:51:03.910
Those are the people that you're going to get,
but if it was legal,

1947
01:51:03.911 --> 01:51:06.760
you're going to get Bill Gates,
you know?
I mean,
if it's legal,

1948
01:51:06.761 --> 01:51:10.570
it fucking how many rock stars have their own whiskey or Tequila or some shit

1949
01:51:10.571 --> 01:51:12.970
like that.
There's a bunch of those guys.
So rappers,

1950
01:51:12.971 --> 01:51:14.680
they would have their own tequila or something.

1951
01:51:15.030 --> 01:51:19.090
Like everybody's got their own shit,
like it's okay,
they're legal drug dealers,

1952
01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:22.370
but as long as you're making money,
legally paying taxes,
the whole thing,

1953
01:51:22.371 --> 01:51:24.700
it's across.
It's above board.
No one cares.

1954
01:51:24.701 --> 01:51:28.630
It's like it's proof positive that drugs should be legal because alcohol was one

1955
01:51:28.631 --> 01:51:32.080
of the fucking worst.
The one of the worst for your body.
Worse than cocaine.

1956
01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:34.720
Most likely we're the traffic accidents.

1957
01:51:36.070 --> 01:51:39.190
Are Their cars out there that won't turn off?
Yes,
the driver's drunk.

1958
01:51:39.310 --> 01:51:43.270
My friend had one.
Wow.
My friend in Colorado had one.
He uh,
he got a [inaudible].

1959
01:51:43.271 --> 01:51:46.810
He's a buddy of mine from New York.
Moved to Colorado or is that why he had it?

1960
01:51:46.811 --> 01:51:50.290
Use it for work.
He got a Dui.
It's not,
the car is not unique.

1961
01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:51.670
It's a setup on the ignition.

1962
01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:55.900
They have a thing built into the ignition and the ignition will will not start

1963
01:51:56.260 --> 01:51:57.580
unless he blows a,

1964
01:51:57.581 --> 01:52:01.630
he has to blow a blood alcohol content that it has to wait a few minutes and it

1965
01:52:01.631 --> 01:52:05.310
won't.
It won't fire up for him if he's drunk.
That's brilliant.
Yeah,

1966
01:52:05.350 --> 01:52:09.310
it should be mandatory.
It's a good idea,
but it's not,
it's not convenient.

1967
01:52:09.610 --> 01:52:12.730
At least his wasn't.
His says it takes a few minutes and I'm like,
dude,

1968
01:52:12.731 --> 01:52:15.910
that's got to suck in the snow because it's Colorado.
I mean he lives in Denver.

1969
01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:19.750
This is drunk driving schools.
They had to,
they don't want that to Scott.

1970
01:52:19.751 --> 01:52:22.780
Their lobbying against it.
They're holding it back.

1971
01:52:22.781 --> 01:52:24.340
They probably would have had them a long time ago,

1972
01:52:24.341 --> 01:52:27.670
but the drunk driving topless schools,
they all got together.
Well,

1973
01:52:27.671 --> 01:52:31.930
what's going to save that is he's fucking Google cars and these like the Tesla

1974
01:52:31.931 --> 01:52:34.990
that can drive itself,
that's going to save all that.
How does that work?

1975
01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:38.050
They work on sensors.
They already work on centers like it's,

1976
01:52:38.051 --> 01:52:43.051
it's a fairly common now that your car will know when you're going across lines

1977
01:52:43.091 --> 01:52:47.120
now,
have you ever noticed that?
Like A,
there's a lot of cars like,
um,

1978
01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:51.730
I had an infinity.
It did.
It was sort of drawing selves.
No,
but it lets you know.

1979
01:52:51.780 --> 01:52:53.670
<v 4>No.
If you're crossing a line,</v>

1980
01:52:53.671 --> 01:52:57.600
it keeps you like Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Cadillac has one.
It's weird,
man.

1981
01:52:57.900 --> 01:53:02.820
They'd,
if you've seen those new Cadillac escalades dude,
those things are dope.

1982
01:53:02.850 --> 01:53:06.240
I rent one of those everywhere I go.
I love those things.
I love,
first of all,

1983
01:53:06.241 --> 01:53:09.210
I love him because I'm an old Italian man.
Hello?
It's a fuck.

1984
01:53:09.211 --> 01:53:12.660
Could Cadillac a good,
uh,
they're probably,

1985
01:53:14.280 --> 01:53:19.200
they're probably in the high sixties,
maybe in the 70s of thousand dollars.

1986
01:53:19.201 --> 01:53:22.530
They're not cheap,
but they're not cheaply made either.
They're fucking bad ass.

1987
01:53:22.531 --> 01:53:24.870
I rent them all the time.
I love them.
They're so smooth to do.

1988
01:53:24.871 --> 01:53:27.240
They have this like magnetic ride control suspension,

1989
01:53:27.390 --> 01:53:30.300
so like just floats over everything.
You get this great view of every,
everything.

1990
01:53:31.020 --> 01:53:33.780
Every time I'm in one,
I'm like,
why don't I drive one of these every day?

1991
01:53:34.110 --> 01:53:37.860
But they have this thing in the seat where if you get close to the edge,

1992
01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:42.000
it vibrates on your thigh,
on your left thigh.

1993
01:53:42.150 --> 01:53:45.000
So like if you're getting close to the edge of the lines,

1994
01:53:45.150 --> 01:53:48.420
like where the lines are,
it lets you know,
hey,
hey,
hey bitch,
get over here.

1995
01:53:48.720 --> 01:53:52.260
It's really weird.
It's real weird if you're backing up,

1996
01:53:52.380 --> 01:53:55.350
like give you live a little vibrate if you get too close to things.

1997
01:53:55.351 --> 01:53:56.640
So it's not just looking,

1998
01:53:56.641 --> 01:54:00.270
you're not just seeing it in a camera or hearing it and beeps that like get

1999
01:54:00.271 --> 01:54:02.400
clean.
You don't have,
they have those.
And some BMWs,

2000
01:54:02.401 --> 01:54:06.220
they have that BBB BBB closer.
You get to think,

2001
01:54:06.390 --> 01:54:10.620
hey bet you're gonna hit the fucking day.
Um,
not only does a Cadillac do that,

2002
01:54:10.621 --> 01:54:13.770
but it vibrates your seat.
It lets you know like where it is.

2003
01:54:13.771 --> 01:54:15.540
Like if you're about to hit something on the right hand side,

2004
01:54:15.630 --> 01:54:20.520
your right thigh will start vibrating.
It's really weird.
It's fucking trippy.
Hmm.

2005
01:54:20.580 --> 01:54:24.600
I don't remember what my point was.
What kind of my car.
Oh,
so that's how the,

2006
01:54:24.601 --> 01:54:27.690
they use some sort of cameras to see those lanes.

2007
01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:31.260
So they know when you're out of lanes they cause even if the road curves,

2008
01:54:31.560 --> 01:54:34.350
they know,
they know if you keep going straight and the road curves,
bitch,

2009
01:54:34.351 --> 01:54:38.850
what the fuck are you doing?
And they also have this thing called,
um,
it's a,

2010
01:54:39.390 --> 01:54:42.780
it's,
you know how you have cruise control like regular cruise control.

2011
01:54:42.781 --> 01:54:46.860
This is a laser,
a laser distance detecting cruise control.

2012
01:54:46.950 --> 01:54:49.050
So like say if your car,
that's pretty common now too.

2013
01:54:49.500 --> 01:54:54.030
If your car is ahead of mine and I set my cruise control for 65 miles an hour,

2014
01:54:54.390 --> 01:54:58.800
if you slow down,
my car slows down to,
if you speed up my car speeds up.

2015
01:54:58.830 --> 01:55:01.750
I don't have to touch shit.
You just put your hands on the steering wheel.
Oh,

2016
01:55:01.980 --> 01:55:04.740
<v 2>it slows down for you.
It speeds up for you.
You know,</v>

2017
01:55:04.830 --> 01:55:06.300
anybody who buys a car like that,

2018
01:55:06.301 --> 01:55:09.690
it's going to sign a fucking stock away versus like a no book.

2019
01:55:11.530 --> 01:55:15.870
Right.
Come on.
Can you imagine the fucking accidents?
Holy Shit.

2020
01:55:15.900 --> 01:55:16.830
This is what they're saying.

2021
01:55:16.831 --> 01:55:19.950
They're saying the Google cars have only had a couple accidents and they've been

2022
01:55:19.951 --> 01:55:22.770
running them through San Francisco for a while,
but people have,

2023
01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:26.220
I wonder how much the Google car accidents have been Google's fault.

2024
01:55:26.250 --> 01:55:30.440
It's so hard to drive Jesus Christ so hard.

2025
01:55:31.410 --> 01:55:35.100
I want my arms down.
He's still got to sit down.
It's so comfortable.

2026
01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:37.590
But you do you really not like driving.

2027
01:55:37.770 --> 01:55:40.810
I would rather have a driver but I don't want,
I don't trust a car.

2028
01:55:40.870 --> 01:55:43.850
It's too unpredictable.
You've got to make some razor sharp on the,

2029
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:45.240
on the highway.
There's a lot of,

2030
01:55:45.870 --> 01:55:49.140
it doesn't have every situation programmed in the car.

2031
01:55:49.170 --> 01:55:52.650
There's all these weird awkward situations where you're just driving and you

2032
01:55:52.651 --> 01:55:54.480
could have avoided if you would have had control,

2033
01:55:54.481 --> 01:55:57.930
but are those weird awkward situations occurring because people are retarded.

2034
01:55:58.590 --> 01:56:01.770
Like if everybody had a driver car car that drove itself,

2035
01:56:01.890 --> 01:56:06.070
maybe those would just vanish and maybe you would get like a,

2036
01:56:06.071 --> 01:56:09.390
a green light when you get on the road.
How much you smoke man.
A lot.

2037
01:56:10.350 --> 01:56:13.260
But maybe thinking about it because like when you,
when you watch it,

2038
01:56:13.261 --> 01:56:15.780
like I'll watch this girl texting the other day on her phone and it was so

2039
01:56:15.781 --> 01:56:17.520
frustrating because we were on the highway,

2040
01:56:17.730 --> 01:56:20.880
we're going to like 65 miles an hour and a couple of times she came close to my

2041
01:56:20.881 --> 01:56:22.890
lane and whenever someone does that I go,
oh,

2042
01:56:22.891 --> 01:56:25.440
I guarantee you they're fucking with their phone.
And I look over on this.

2043
01:56:25.441 --> 01:56:29.850
Girls do it in this shit.
Everybody does that shit man.
Don't do that.

2044
01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:32.910
I don't do that.
I don't do that.
I leave my fucking phone on the,

2045
01:56:32.911 --> 01:56:36.090
on the passenger seat.
I take it,
I put it over there.
I'm not fucking with that.

2046
01:56:36.230 --> 01:56:38.820
She'll talk and drive though.
I'll talk and drive on my phone on my,

2047
01:56:38.890 --> 01:56:41.820
I press a button on the steering wheel.
Yeah.
That's not bad.

2048
01:56:41.850 --> 01:56:44.580
Like because it's going through the Bluetooth.
You have a little conversation.

2049
01:56:44.581 --> 01:56:46.350
It's like you could see everything.

2050
01:56:46.470 --> 01:56:48.390
It's like having a conversation with a dude who sit next to you.

2051
01:56:48.391 --> 01:56:49.290
It's totally normal.

2052
01:56:49.630 --> 01:56:54.410
Is it legal to cause it's illegal to text or to do anything on your phone?
Yes.

2053
01:56:54.870 --> 01:56:59.820
Is it illegal to uh,
go through your CD's or go through your,
uh,
your,
uh,

2054
01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:03.750
stations on your side,
on your satellite?
You know,
you can do this,

2055
01:57:03.780 --> 01:57:07.430
but you can do this.
You can press the,
the,
the thing on your,

2056
01:57:07.540 --> 01:57:10.740
your car that's stationary.
It's like locked in.

2057
01:57:11.010 --> 01:57:12.330
But if you have something in your hand,

2058
01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:15.450
you start pressing that to make your music come on.
Which all my music,

2059
01:57:15.451 --> 01:57:19.350
because I'm my iPhone,
my,
I carry everything on my iPhone.
I carry all my music.

2060
01:57:19.351 --> 01:57:23.060
I never have enough.
I used to have an iPod connector.
Does that,
those are,

2061
01:57:23.170 --> 01:57:27.030
I still have it in my,
uh,
my BMW,
so I was a little iPod connector.

2062
01:57:27.300 --> 01:57:31.530
I still have iPods.
Why though?
My fucking phone is a hundred and something gigs.

2063
01:57:31.531 --> 01:57:34.320
Like there's no way I need all that.
Yeah.
Like you'd have to have every,

2064
01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:36.940
how could you listen to all that?
You greedy bitch and just,

2065
01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:38.340
you have to be a crazy person.

2066
01:57:39.090 --> 01:57:42.650
I think people are now since we went to were like,

2067
01:57:42.660 --> 01:57:47.660
it seems like more and more just using our laptops less and our phones way more,

2068
01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:52.850
way more.
Right.
So I think that's great for music.
Oh,

2069
01:57:53.220 --> 01:57:58.220
listening to music on your computer is not as cool as being out and about on

2070
01:57:58.321 --> 01:57:59.190
your phone.

2071
01:57:59.310 --> 01:58:04.310
You know with headsets and you can be drawn on the airport music that you can

2072
01:58:04.351 --> 01:58:08.400
send me.
You've sent me songs.
I listened to them right when you sent me though.

2073
01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:12.270
Like liver,
there's no delay at all.
Yeah.
How crazy be some of your shit.

2074
01:58:12.450 --> 01:58:16.620
And I press play and I'm listening to it in my car and then get some logins.
Oh,

2075
01:58:16.621 --> 01:58:20.520
it was good dude.
But in seconds,
in seconds,
like Le,
I mean you could,

2076
01:58:20.670 --> 01:58:21.930
you could ask Siri.

2077
01:58:22.170 --> 01:58:26.310
Now I'm going to stop this because people are getting mad at me for saying this

2078
01:58:26.311 --> 01:58:30.810
because it makes your phone go off.
All right.
If you say H,
e y,

2079
01:58:31.650 --> 01:58:34.980
s,
I,
r.
I.
N,
e,
Say those things together.
It'll,

2080
01:58:35.400 --> 01:58:39.360
you can ask it things like it'll transcribe things for you to transcribes for me

2081
01:58:39.390 --> 01:58:42.010
accidentally.
Just ice tea.
I down the phone is

2082
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:46.120
<v 3>like taking every word that I said accidentally because I said those words</v>

2083
01:58:46.121 --> 01:58:49.090
during a podcast or something that sounded enough like it.

2084
01:58:49.420 --> 01:58:51.850
But when you have that,
when you,
when you do something like that,

2085
01:58:51.851 --> 01:58:56.740
you could tell it,
hey,
download me smoke serpent.
Uh,
Hey,
uh,

2086
01:58:56.770 --> 01:58:59.110
go to Eddie Bravo radio number three,

2087
01:58:59.111 --> 01:59:03.010
and it will fucking find it on the Internet and play it for you.
Dude.
It's crazy.

2088
01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:04.990
Yeah.
That's what we were talking about before,

2089
01:59:05.020 --> 01:59:08.920
before we started the podcast was my music conspiracy theory.
Oh yeah.
Well,
okay.

2090
01:59:08.921 --> 01:59:13.590
What's your music experience?
Right.
This is an Improv dot.
This is just me,
uh,

2091
01:59:14.110 --> 01:59:16.060
smoking a lot of weed and saying stupid shit.

2092
01:59:16.180 --> 01:59:21.180
But it seems that the record companies in the record business have always,

2093
01:59:22.090 --> 01:59:26.530
always ripped off the artist.
Artists never make that.
All of them.

2094
01:59:26.531 --> 01:59:29.440
When you look at documentaries,
every band the same thing.

2095
01:59:29.590 --> 01:59:33.160
They're getting ripped off.
If you watch that eagles documentary,
it's amazing.

2096
01:59:33.161 --> 01:59:35.470
I'm not an eagles fan.
I'll never buy an eagle's CD,

2097
01:59:35.590 --> 01:59:39.430
but I respect the shit out of him.
I respect the shit out of us on the ceiling.

2098
01:59:39.810 --> 01:59:42.460
I respect the shit out of them and they do got some good stuff,

2099
01:59:42.461 --> 01:59:45.190
but I'm just not that,
that,
that kind of southern rock,

2100
01:59:45.191 --> 01:59:49.750
they're all just prisoners here.
Device.
I love the story shit.

2101
01:59:49.751 --> 01:59:52.000
The documentary,
the story of how they got together and,

2102
01:59:52.240 --> 01:59:55.630
and their dynamics when they broke up and got back together and she did the

2103
01:59:55.631 --> 01:59:59.200
eagle stories and they like Hotel California.
It's all right.
It's not mine.

2104
01:59:59.210 --> 02:00:01.030
I'm doing too many strippers dance to it.

2105
02:00:01.100 --> 02:00:05.360
I put the story and then you watch,
uh,

2106
02:00:05.490 --> 02:00:10.120
like 30 seconds to Mars documentary and the record company is suing them for

2107
02:00:10.121 --> 02:00:14.950
like 30 million and explained that that's Jared Leto right?

2108
02:00:14.950 --> 02:00:17.170
That's the actor.
He also has a band.

2109
02:00:17.320 --> 02:00:21.670
His band had a deal with a record company and it all fucking went.

2110
02:00:21.700 --> 02:00:24.730
They just didn't get paid.
Basically.
It just,
they just never got paid.

2111
02:00:24.731 --> 02:00:27.340
They were huge.
Uh,
they got a couple of really good songs.

2112
02:00:27.341 --> 02:00:31.540
That echelon is one of my all time favorite songs.
But anyways,
uh,

2113
02:00:31.570 --> 02:00:35.440
you watch that documentary and it's always the same thing.

2114
02:00:35.500 --> 02:00:39.070
The record company doesn't have money.
They are not going to pay.

2115
02:00:39.190 --> 02:00:43.090
We had to pay all this shit for you.
We bought your fucking video.
We paid for.

2116
02:00:43.091 --> 02:00:44.230
You've got down producer,

2117
02:00:44.290 --> 02:00:47.160
you've got to pay that shit back and you better fucking get on the road,

2118
02:00:47.170 --> 02:00:50.320
motherfucker.
You Owe.
You owe us money.
You owe us money.

2119
02:00:50.520 --> 02:00:54.580
This is the movie artifact artifact.
Sometimes we must fight in order to be free.

2120
02:00:54.610 --> 02:00:57.730
Okay,
I got something to watch on a plane.
Is that 30 minutes seconds to Mars?

2121
02:00:57.760 --> 02:00:59.500
Yeah,
that's the one on iTunes.

2122
02:00:59.860 --> 02:01:02.320
I would definitely was an iTunes and everything to buy for about a year,

2123
02:01:02.321 --> 02:01:03.410
but you've got to give it up to Jerry.

2124
02:01:03.411 --> 02:01:08.350
Glenn will cause he's the only guy on the planet.
It's a legitimate musician.

2125
02:01:08.351 --> 02:01:11.080
Rock star,
legitimate where he has millions of fans.

2126
02:01:11.081 --> 02:01:15.010
They sold millions of records and he's a very successful actor too.

2127
02:01:15.220 --> 02:01:17.650
You could almost say maybes reaching that a list.

2128
02:01:17.670 --> 02:01:20.440
It jarred Leto is a famous dude.
Nobody else has done that.

2129
02:01:20.530 --> 02:01:22.780
Music and acting that huge.

2130
02:01:22.900 --> 02:01:25.150
You've got to give it up and they got a couple of really good songs.

2131
02:01:25.300 --> 02:01:29.380
I'm not a gigantic 30 seconds to Mars Fan,
but echelon and the mission.

2132
02:01:30.010 --> 02:01:33.100
Absolutely fantastic.
So they uh,

2133
02:01:33.190 --> 02:01:36.810
they got a record deal and just were not getting any money.
You know,

2134
02:01:36.820 --> 02:01:40.310
I forget the details,
but they went to court it so they won't get any,
no.

2135
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:42.230
What happened is they wouldn't get any money in Jared level.
Said,

2136
02:01:42.231 --> 02:01:45.200
I'm fucking out this motherfucker.
You guys aren't you guys?
Oh,
it's so much shit.

2137
02:01:45.201 --> 02:01:46.790
He wasn't going to say shit.
So he just said,

2138
02:01:46.791 --> 02:01:49.750
I'm going to make an album on my own.
Fuck this.
Right.

2139
02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:53.660
We sell millions of records,
we don't have anything and they're not giving us,

2140
02:01:53.661 --> 02:01:56.510
they're not paying us.
Right.
So the record company goes,
Oh,

2141
02:01:56.511 --> 02:01:58.280
you think you could just do that?
Like the record,

2142
02:01:58.281 --> 02:02:00.620
the contract was over like in six months.
Really.

2143
02:02:00.621 --> 02:02:03.680
They could have just waited it out,
but he just started working on a new album.

2144
02:02:03.681 --> 02:02:06.950
Said,
fuck that record company.
He goes,
oh,
he worked on an album.
That's our album.

2145
02:02:08.060 --> 02:02:09.170
You know what I mean?
Something like that.

2146
02:02:09.171 --> 02:02:10.960
Something like that where they ended up suing them.

2147
02:02:11.060 --> 02:02:12.530
You think you could just walk away from us?

2148
02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:14.920
How about we're going to come after you and for 30 million?

2149
02:02:15.130 --> 02:02:18.320
I have a friend who works,
she's a receptionist who was a receptionist.

2150
02:02:18.321 --> 02:02:19.154
She got fired.

2151
02:02:19.230 --> 02:02:23.900
She was working for some company that makes TV shows or some shit and they knew

2152
02:02:23.901 --> 02:02:24.860
that she was a comedian.

2153
02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:29.150
You know she's an amateur comedian and so while she was working with them,

2154
02:02:29.180 --> 02:02:34.180
she developed this idea for some pilot with her and her friend who's also a

2155
02:02:34.221 --> 02:02:35.054
comedian.

2156
02:02:35.150 --> 02:02:38.210
So then all of a sudden the company she's working for wanted to sign some

2157
02:02:38.211 --> 02:02:41.750
intellectual property agreement than anything she came up with when she was

2158
02:02:41.751 --> 02:02:45.950
working there would be there and they literally said to her,
why you work here?

2159
02:02:45.951 --> 02:02:49.510
We own your brain can just imagine how crazy that is.
Like she said,

2160
02:02:49.580 --> 02:02:50.930
she's a fucking receptionist,

2161
02:02:51.080 --> 02:02:54.080
comedian and funny comedian too and she's trying to make it,
you know,

2162
02:02:54.081 --> 02:02:57.430
she's out there hustling and the company that she works for that doesn't need

2163
02:02:57.530 --> 02:03:01.160
the,
they make TV shows,
they're not using her in that regard.

2164
02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:02.660
They're using her as a receptionist.

2165
02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:07.100
They just decide that somehow or another they're going to figure out a way to

2166
02:03:07.101 --> 02:03:11.450
steal from her.
We got to tap into her creativity and your ideas.

2167
02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:14.450
But imagine that,
and you're paying someone like dog shit money.

2168
02:03:14.780 --> 02:03:19.430
You're paying someone like receptionists pay and you want to own their dream,

2169
02:03:19.580 --> 02:03:22.630
their dream of a show that's fucking dirty dairy.

2170
02:03:22.730 --> 02:03:24.540
Every band goes through the same shit.
It's,

2171
02:03:24.590 --> 02:03:27.770
it's like the record company is owned by gangsters themselves and they go,

2172
02:03:27.771 --> 02:03:32.210
they're going to,
and when you sign a contract,
you don't give a fuck.

2173
02:03:32.300 --> 02:03:35.710
You're just this kid from the small town.
Your band got big,
you got to,

2174
02:03:35.711 --> 02:03:38.750
you're in Hollywood now,
you're going to sign the goddamn deal.

2175
02:03:38.810 --> 02:03:41.420
You don't even care.
You know,
you're getting ripped off.

2176
02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:44.570
It's so why it's so known that like everybody knows in the music business,

2177
02:03:44.660 --> 02:03:46.640
you don't make any money on your first album or two.

2178
02:03:46.940 --> 02:03:49.870
They'll make it so that you'll start making money on your third,

2179
02:03:49.871 --> 02:03:53.120
a four hour out album.
Uh,
that's where you're going to get a bigger cut.

2180
02:03:53.300 --> 02:03:56.450
But that for first album or two,
you ain't going to make shit.
And you know what?

2181
02:03:56.510 --> 02:03:59.000
It's bad.
It's good business to just,

2182
02:03:59.180 --> 02:04:00.830
when it's time for you to make the good money,

2183
02:04:00.980 --> 02:04:03.710
now we're just going to leave you on your own and find a new Os.

2184
02:04:03.711 --> 02:04:06.800
We always need to,
can't bring in the new ones.
There's always new R and B artist.

2185
02:04:06.920 --> 02:04:09.950
There's always new rappers,
there's always new ones.
There's new ones coming in,

2186
02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:11.810
new rock bands.
They're always coming in.

2187
02:04:11.930 --> 02:04:14.870
95% of them are going to fail and they want never make it to the third album,

2188
02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:17.570
but they got them coming to SAS.
They got to come in spirits you right,

2189
02:04:17.571 --> 02:04:20.360
because they all make the money and their second and third albums and the first

2190
02:04:20.361 --> 02:04:22.190
and the record company just leaves him.
Just get through it.

2191
02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:26.450
It's like an anomaly where you have a Depeche mode or youtube where they get

2192
02:04:26.451 --> 02:04:29.990
fucking massive and they could just sustain a career in 20 years into their

2193
02:04:29.991 --> 02:04:30.710
career.

2194
02:04:30.710 --> 02:04:35.570
A right fucking beautiful day and that's a smash hit once you like that.

2195
02:04:35.571 --> 02:04:38.190
Then at the,
at the v after 10 15 years,

2196
02:04:38.190 --> 02:04:42.120
<v 4>you,
you own your own shit and you realize,
okay,
I'm going to do my own shit here,</v>

2197
02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:45.240
but then get the majors to distribute it.

2198
02:04:45.330 --> 02:04:49.320
I'll use their distribution like with Dr Dre.
Did you know about what prince did?

2199
02:04:49.321 --> 02:04:53.040
He had to use a fake name to even use a next.
Now looking back,

2200
02:04:53.041 --> 02:04:56.700
everyone thought prince was crazy.
Prince is a fucking genius.

2201
02:04:58.260 --> 02:05:02.130
He came formerly known as Prince.
He's not friends anymore.
Nobody can say a shit.

2202
02:05:02.160 --> 02:05:05.280
He loved it.
Nobody could say the band.
Yeah.
They knew.
Well,

2203
02:05:05.700 --> 02:05:08.760
he proved a point to bitch should come and see me.
They're coming to see me.

2204
02:05:08.761 --> 02:05:12.150
They're not,
they don't give a fuck Obama with Warner brothers at a and M or,

2205
02:05:12.600 --> 02:05:16.230
you know,
that's all nonsense.
They just stole.
They were stealing.
Yeah.
You know,

2206
02:05:16.231 --> 02:05:18.430
they're trying to do that in the world of podcasting,
there's a,

2207
02:05:18.440 --> 02:05:19.280
there's a lot of that going on.

2208
02:05:19.290 --> 02:05:21.330
The world of podcasting where companies are coming in,

2209
02:05:21.331 --> 02:05:25.500
they're trying to own half of podcasts and put you on a network.

2210
02:05:25.620 --> 02:05:27.660
So I really comment.
It's been a lot of,

2211
02:05:27.661 --> 02:05:31.020
of a lot of that been going on where they're trying to scoop up podcasts because

2212
02:05:31.021 --> 02:05:34.320
podcasts are such a simple model and you have one,
you know how it is.

2213
02:05:34.440 --> 02:05:38.130
You take it,
you record it,
you upload it on on I,
uh,

2214
02:05:38.250 --> 02:05:43.190
iTunes with some sort of a,
a server.
It's not difficult.
Like,
you know,

2215
02:05:43.191 --> 02:05:45.660
use someone like a service,
like Libsyn is what we use that they,

2216
02:05:45.740 --> 02:05:50.400
they're actually in the podcast distribution business.
And once you do that,

2217
02:05:50.730 --> 02:05:54.330
I mean that's basically it.
That's all you have to do.
That's not a lot.

2218
02:05:54.510 --> 02:05:58.530
If someone like radio lab or like hardcore history is a perfect example,

2219
02:05:58.531 --> 02:06:00.510
he's almost always like in the top three or four,

2220
02:06:00.511 --> 02:06:04.230
whenever he releases something new,
maybe sometimes,
often one.
Number one,

2221
02:06:04.231 --> 02:06:05.340
I've seen them one a couple of times.

2222
02:06:05.910 --> 02:06:09.560
It's just a dude and a producer putting together a history podcast.

2223
02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:11.010
It's your podcast.

2224
02:06:11.190 --> 02:06:15.090
You had a direct impact on what's going on with marijuana today,

2225
02:06:15.750 --> 02:06:18.960
10 years ago before this podcast.
It's like it's,

2226
02:06:19.170 --> 02:06:23.040
I think you are the biggest spokesmodel the spokesmodel spokesperson

2227
02:06:23.250 --> 02:06:27.690
spokesperson for,
for uh,
for getting people to open their eyes.

2228
02:06:28.200 --> 02:06:30.720
You know,
cause you don't know about all that.
But I think the Internet is,

2229
02:06:30.750 --> 02:06:33.610
and I think I'm on the Internet.
That's what I think it is because I'm,
it's,

2230
02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:34.980
these are all my ideas.

2231
02:06:34.981 --> 02:06:38.580
These are ideas that I've gotten from reading all sorts of crazy shit that gets

2232
02:06:38.581 --> 02:06:42.780
sent me all the time reading different to the Messenger.
We are all,

2233
02:06:42.850 --> 02:06:47.070
we're all like conduits were all like rivers,
you know,
like some,
some,

2234
02:06:47.130 --> 02:06:51.390
some of us we tap into like a big ocean of information and we could shuttle that

2235
02:06:51.391 --> 02:06:53.820
shit downstream.
That's really what it is.
So what,
what,

2236
02:06:53.821 --> 02:06:56.040
when you get a podcast or if you know,

2237
02:06:56.041 --> 02:06:58.050
like someone sends me interesting shit on Twitter.

2238
02:06:58.270 --> 02:07:01.920
Oh I retweet things all day long,
all day long.
I always look at something,

2239
02:07:02.040 --> 02:07:04.680
I'll read it for a few minutes.
It just seems interesting.
I retweet it.

2240
02:07:04.681 --> 02:07:08.790
And that's why people say like,
are you endorsing things?
And you retweet hot it.

2241
02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:13.740
I found it interesting.
But make your own goddamn conclusions.
If I've,
right,
if I,

2242
02:07:13.800 --> 02:07:17.700
if something is totally ridiculous,
like some Christian Guy thinks that,
uh,

2243
02:07:17.730 --> 02:07:20.040
gays are responsible for the drought,
I will fucking retweet.

2244
02:07:20.041 --> 02:07:23.260
That doesn't mean I believe that.
All right.
I just think like,
Ha,

2245
02:07:23.290 --> 02:07:23.790
look at this guy.

2246
02:07:23.790 --> 02:07:27.390
I don't have time to like go through all the information with people,

2247
02:07:27.391 --> 02:07:31.590
but I'd like the fact that I'm this sort of portal.

2248
02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:36.100
So because of that I feel like,
um,
you know,
I,
I get

2249
02:07:36.880 --> 02:07:37.601
<v 3>privy to,</v>

2250
02:07:37.601 --> 02:07:41.230
or I get access to a lot of information that I might not have ever sought out

2251
02:07:41.231 --> 02:07:45.790
myself.
It gets sent to me.
It's really cool.
And then I do the same thing.

2252
02:07:45.820 --> 02:07:48.150
You know,
I talk about it on here and the w we'll sit around,

2253
02:07:48.180 --> 02:07:51.490
we'll try to think about it.
We'll try to break it down or figure out what's,

2254
02:07:52.370 --> 02:07:56.590
it's just another,
another river of the Internet.
That's what it is.

2255
02:07:56.740 --> 02:08:00.280
That this is all some new thing that's happening to the human race.

2256
02:08:00.550 --> 02:08:03.140
The human race gets to discuss things.
Uh,

2257
02:08:03.880 --> 02:08:05.980
once the Internet blew up,

2258
02:08:06.310 --> 02:08:10.420
that's when the music business supposedly went down and maybe it did go down

2259
02:08:10.421 --> 02:08:12.790
because record sales definitely went down.
They disappeared.

2260
02:08:13.540 --> 02:08:16.780
Pretty much all tower records closes down.
Virgin records.

2261
02:08:17.670 --> 02:08:19.390
Virgin closed down crazy,

2262
02:08:19.450 --> 02:08:23.500
but it's the same owners of these record companies.

2263
02:08:23.590 --> 02:08:25.960
They always told the artists they weren't making money.

2264
02:08:26.050 --> 02:08:30.970
Now this is my conspiracy theory now I think the music business is bigger than

2265
02:08:30.971 --> 02:08:34.750
fucking ever with the Internet.
They're not selling cds,

2266
02:08:34.751 --> 02:08:36.160
they're not selling solid product,

2267
02:08:36.370 --> 02:08:40.240
but I think they're making so much more goddamn money than ever before.

2268
02:08:40.450 --> 02:08:43.900
And why should they tell anybody?
Oh No,
you know what?
The record business sucks.

2269
02:08:43.901 --> 02:08:45.690
So now,
now you just want to get a record.

2270
02:08:45.700 --> 02:08:49.320
They making the money from online people.

2271
02:08:49.540 --> 02:08:54.340
The stuff is being sold through what?
Itunes.
Is that the number one?
The thing is,

2272
02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:58.510
yes,
people do steal music.
Wait a minute,
what are you saying?
No,
no.

2273
02:08:58.630 --> 02:08:59.280
I'm talking about,

2274
02:08:59.280 --> 02:09:03.040
I'm giving them the whole overall scope is that people do steal music.

2275
02:09:03.041 --> 02:09:06.460
I know that,
but I think when you go the old way where you're,

2276
02:09:06.520 --> 02:09:09.640
the only way you're going to get a CD is through the actual distribution.

2277
02:09:09.730 --> 02:09:14.730
You can't reach fucking but a fraction of the world unless you're gigantic and

2278
02:09:15.340 --> 02:09:17.580
go,
unless you're one of the big bands,
very hard.

2279
02:09:17.590 --> 02:09:20.800
You've got to have a physical copy.
But yes,
we're not selling cds anymore,

2280
02:09:20.890 --> 02:09:24.460
but now we have the whole on the whole world and they could buy it instantly.

2281
02:09:24.610 --> 02:09:29.080
I mean,
I can easily,
I'm okay with computers.
I'm like a blue bound computers.

2282
02:09:29.081 --> 02:09:31.360
I'm sure I could find a place where I can get free stuff,

2283
02:09:31.510 --> 02:09:34.630
but iTunes is so convenient and I got an iPhone.

2284
02:09:34.810 --> 02:09:38.350
I'm buying all my old vinyl stuff and,
and it's in my phone.

2285
02:09:38.530 --> 02:09:42.190
I think more than ever now.
Now that we're a phone culture,

2286
02:09:42.340 --> 02:09:45.130
I think music is bigger than Evernote.
I love music.

2287
02:09:45.190 --> 02:09:49.240
I'm so passionate about music.
I'm always hunting.
It's easier to find stuff.

2288
02:09:49.330 --> 02:09:52.510
Satellite Radio,
which is Sam Shizam is huge.

2289
02:09:52.511 --> 02:09:56.050
Anytime that I think now more than ever I think.

2290
02:09:56.260 --> 02:09:58.150
I think music is getting really good.

2291
02:09:58.151 --> 02:10:01.860
There's a lot of good artists out there and I think,
I dunno,
suck for awhile,

2292
02:10:01.900 --> 02:10:02.790
but I think there's,

2293
02:10:02.970 --> 02:10:07.970
there's going to be a new explosion of how we get and we get our music.

2294
02:10:08.260 --> 02:10:11.710
The record business aren't important anymore.
What's important is music.

2295
02:10:11.790 --> 02:10:15.910
We know it's important as music producers and an artist and everyone's losing

2296
02:10:15.940 --> 02:10:18.780
their own stuff and you can distribute stuff.
Soundcloud,

2297
02:10:19.210 --> 02:10:23.150
it's a totally different animal.
Now I'm making music.
I make a song.
Um,

2298
02:10:23.230 --> 02:10:28.180
I w I like if a independent label wanted to sign me as a producer,

2299
02:10:28.190 --> 02:10:32.260
whatever,
I would never take like an independent label.
I would take some deal.

2300
02:10:32.261 --> 02:10:35.810
That was a huge,
that was life changing.
But for me too,

2301
02:10:36.150 --> 02:10:38.960
it's just way easier just to do whatever I want to do,

2302
02:10:38.990 --> 02:10:43.730
not have to worry about anybody and just put whatever I want whenever I want.

2303
02:10:43.790 --> 02:10:45.230
I don't have any deadline.

2304
02:10:45.350 --> 02:10:48.590
Soon as you start getting deadlines and someone owns a piece on my motherfucking

2305
02:10:48.650 --> 02:10:53.630
music,
I dunno about that.
Not just a piece.
Most independent label,

2306
02:10:53.631 --> 02:10:57.470
you know.
No one's heard of.
That's going to be a huge label for me to honey.

2307
02:10:57.471 --> 02:11:01.070
Honey.
Had a problem with one of their last,
a song they had his last album.

2308
02:11:01.220 --> 02:11:02.990
There's this one song that I loved and I'm like,

2309
02:11:02.991 --> 02:11:04.790
why isn't that song on your album?

2310
02:11:05.450 --> 02:11:07.770
And even though they wrote that song they produce,

2311
02:11:07.771 --> 02:11:11.320
it was all there is the record company wanting to own it.
So it's like,
oh Jesus.

2312
02:11:11.330 --> 02:11:14.750
So they just decided to not put it on there and my dad is crazy.
That is crazy.

2313
02:11:14.751 --> 02:11:17.690
They just want to own it.
Someone else owns.
How crazy is that though?

2314
02:11:18.260 --> 02:11:21.670
And you sing it,
you write it,
you sing it,
you,

2315
02:11:21.720 --> 02:11:24.940
you experiment with it,
you change it.
And some do.

2316
02:11:25.050 --> 02:11:29.750
You don't know it all.
They own it.
It's theirs.
They want it.

2317
02:11:30.110 --> 02:11:32.420
They didn't pay anything for it.
They don't want to pay you for it.

2318
02:11:32.420 --> 02:11:34.890
They just want it.
It's part of the deal.
So it's like what,
what,

2319
02:11:35.450 --> 02:11:38.930
what exactly are the record companies needed for?
What are they needed for?

2320
02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:42.140
But you know what's going on is,
is w the music video,

2321
02:11:42.230 --> 02:11:46.790
MTV no longer exist as that music video,
TV station.
What are they now?

2322
02:11:46.910 --> 02:11:50.570
They just do it.
Let it like a regular channel now that's so weird.
But um,

2323
02:11:50.600 --> 02:11:52.550
they might show videos a little bit here and there.

2324
02:11:52.551 --> 02:11:54.860
I don't even pay attention no more,
but,
but uh,

2325
02:11:55.100 --> 02:12:00.100
why or a record labels still making these huge big budget music videos because

2326
02:12:01.521 --> 02:12:04.760
now everyone they do,
they'd go to vivo or youtube.

2327
02:12:04.761 --> 02:12:07.370
People love watching me at music videos now it's easy.

2328
02:12:07.371 --> 02:12:10.300
You could watch a music video now on your phone before you got to watch it on

2329
02:12:10.310 --> 02:12:12.620
MTV.
How are you going to get MTV on your phone now?

2330
02:12:12.620 --> 02:12:16.340
So there's like a resurgence of music.
Videos are huge and,

2331
02:12:16.490 --> 02:12:21.490
and music is so easy to listen to and share and buy and Shazamm and spread

2332
02:12:22.010 --> 02:12:27.010
amongst the music industry thrives on niches and you know,

2333
02:12:27.170 --> 02:12:29.780
metal people and R and B people r and B.

2334
02:12:29.781 --> 02:12:33.380
People aren't trying to sell music to these white kids that are in the insane

2335
02:12:33.381 --> 02:12:38.060
clown posse.
You know what I mean?
It,
it,
the music,
music industry is all about,

2336
02:12:38.061 --> 02:12:41.600
do you know your niche and,
and are you selling to the right market?

2337
02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:45.530
And that's what the Internet has become.
So for music,
I think,

2338
02:12:45.860 --> 02:12:50.360
I don't think the Internet killed music.
I think it's gonna.
It's gonna expire.

2339
02:12:50.420 --> 02:12:54.380
I think it's exploding right now.
Only killed these parasitic music companies.

2340
02:12:54.410 --> 02:12:58.370
That's what it kills.
Yeah,
exactly.
Exactly.
You don't go ripping it off.

2341
02:12:58.460 --> 02:13:02.090
Most people are buying the shoe.
They were distributors.
That's all they were.

2342
02:13:02.120 --> 02:13:03.770
They were distributors and promote publicists.

2343
02:13:03.890 --> 02:13:08.330
Now the public system or the publicist,
the best version of it is social media.

2344
02:13:08.630 --> 02:13:11.870
The best version of it is having a good connection with the fans on social media

2345
02:13:11.900 --> 02:13:15.470
and people finding out about your shit and they spread it virally.
That's,

2346
02:13:15.471 --> 02:13:19.460
that's the best way to do it.
And without that mean,
then,

2347
02:13:19.461 --> 02:13:23.090
then what happens is these companies,
like these big record companies,

2348
02:13:23.091 --> 02:13:25.920
they essentially become publicized.
We own your Twitter.
Yeah,
they will.

2349
02:13:25.921 --> 02:13:29.120
They do Twitter.
I told you what happened with him.
Well,

2350
02:13:29.121 --> 02:13:31.650
they tried to do that with me,
man.
They trying to own your Twitter

2351
02:13:32.110 --> 02:13:34.740
<v 2>to,
they tried to post on it.
One of the TV shows I was doing,</v>

2352
02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:39.660
it was one of the barrio wells.
They wanted to,
uh,
have access to my social media.

2353
02:13:39.661 --> 02:13:44.400
They wanted to use my Twitter and my Facebook.
Oh Shit.
And I was ready.

2354
02:13:44.401 --> 02:13:48.000
I was like fuck you.
This is no way to do that too.
Like a fan page type deal.

2355
02:13:48.001 --> 02:13:50.820
You know what I mean?
Like some like an extra one that I'm not really paying.

2356
02:13:50.821 --> 02:13:53.580
I'm not paying any attention.
You can create your own one.
You could do that shit.

2357
02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:57.350
He,
but if you sign off on that,
it's still no good.
Like yeah,
yeah,

2358
02:13:57.351 --> 02:13:59.820
yeah because you don't,
you don't know what the fuck they're pushed.

2359
02:13:59.860 --> 02:14:02.880
They're putting up there.
Unless you approve each and every message,

2360
02:14:03.540 --> 02:14:08.010
you know the best way to do it would be you tell me what you want me to say.

2361
02:14:08.010 --> 02:14:09.000
What are you trying to get me to say?

2362
02:14:09.001 --> 02:14:12.090
And I'll tell you whether or not that's ever going to happen.
And if you,

2363
02:14:12.091 --> 02:14:15.240
if you want to say something in my voice like cause which they're trying to do,

2364
02:14:15.241 --> 02:14:19.200
I'm like you're fucking crazy.
You're crazy.
Cause I'm,
I'm not going to agree.

2365
02:14:19.290 --> 02:14:23.190
Hey you guys should tune in to blah blah blah and prime time and eight amazing.

2366
02:14:23.370 --> 02:14:23.911
Like we would.

2367
02:14:23.911 --> 02:14:26.460
It'd be cool if you guys tweeted this like what are you out of your mind?

2368
02:14:26.760 --> 02:14:27.720
You think I'm a tweet?

2369
02:14:27.870 --> 02:14:32.550
Promotions for other shows or live tweet things that you've got going on or get

2370
02:14:32.551 --> 02:14:35.190
involved with your fucking shark week or whatever the fuck it is.

2371
02:14:35.310 --> 02:14:38.310
Like that kind of crazy talk like that's what happens when you become a part of

2372
02:14:38.311 --> 02:14:39.350
a network.
You,

2373
02:14:39.410 --> 02:14:44.410
you also become like involved in promos and they want to like they owned Arsenio

2374
02:14:45.870 --> 02:14:48.360
Hall's Facebook.
He couldn't,
couldn't get his Facebook back when he did that.

2375
02:14:48.361 --> 02:14:52.020
Arsenio,
the resurgence of the Arsenio Hall show it before on his own was his.

2376
02:14:52.090 --> 02:14:54.720
It was his was his butt to do in a new show.
That was part of the deal.

2377
02:14:54.721 --> 02:14:57.900
They wanted to take over his fucking Facebook.
That's crazy.
That's what they do.

2378
02:14:58.100 --> 02:15:00.840
That's what they do because that's all the power you blow up.

2379
02:15:00.930 --> 02:15:04.590
Some artists like Rihanna's Twitter,
she can just base on her Twitter.

2380
02:15:04.620 --> 02:15:08.140
She can make or break.
Bands are not really break.
I'm chicken,
make them.

2381
02:15:08.670 --> 02:15:10.680
She could do incredible stuff by herself.

2382
02:15:10.681 --> 02:15:14.700
She has all the power so she loses the label just with that Twitter.
Oh yes,

2383
02:15:14.720 --> 02:15:17.700
she owns her own show and Instagram and all those things.

2384
02:15:17.730 --> 02:15:18.690
That's all you need to do.

2385
02:15:21.330 --> 02:15:23.370
A lot of the deals now are,

2386
02:15:23.430 --> 02:15:27.390
I think the hour is going back to the people that everything is being set up in

2387
02:15:27.391 --> 02:15:29.430
record.
Labels are probably fumbling,

2388
02:15:29.700 --> 02:15:32.130
but they're still trying to Jack Young artists.

2389
02:15:32.131 --> 02:15:35.120
They're still trying to do shit to make it all that online money.
Yeah.

2390
02:15:35.520 --> 02:15:38.160
I don't know how much money that is.
I would Jamie,
what is the depth thing?

2391
02:15:38.161 --> 02:15:39.330
Online is a lot.
I know,

2392
02:15:39.331 --> 02:15:44.331
but I mean I want to know if there's ever been a study on what percentage of

2393
02:15:44.881 --> 02:15:48.480
music gets purchased online,
how much of it just gets downloaded illegally?

2394
02:15:48.780 --> 02:15:50.460
Like what do you think the ratio is?

2395
02:15:50.790 --> 02:15:53.480
I think most people you had to guess what the Spotify coming and non people

2396
02:15:53.490 --> 02:15:56.420
paying for that.
They can track that and people pay it and that's,
and that's,

2397
02:15:56.520 --> 02:15:59.070
that's problematic.
That's in a lot of ways,

2398
02:15:59.071 --> 02:16:02.760
a lot like a record company because that's one of the big complaints that

2399
02:16:02.761 --> 02:16:06.300
artists have had about Spotify is that they don't get paid enough money from it.

2400
02:16:06.301 --> 02:16:09.990
That's like Taylor swift's complained about it.
Really?
They're complaining.
Yeah.

2401
02:16:10.080 --> 02:16:14.310
Yeah.
They,
I think they're trying to get into the podcast world too,

2402
02:16:14.340 --> 02:16:16.580
but the point is like all they're,

2403
02:16:16.581 --> 02:16:19.860
they're like they're an aggregator right there a portal for something.

2404
02:16:19.861 --> 02:16:22.500
Like how much money should a portal make?
I mean,

2405
02:16:22.501 --> 02:16:25.470
what percentage should a portal make and what percentage should Taylor swift

2406
02:16:25.471 --> 02:16:26.040
make?

2407
02:16:26.040 --> 02:16:30.070
Taylor swift should make almost everything slowly for outlook of this frail made

2408
02:16:30.071 --> 02:16:35.071
only $2,700 in songwriter royalties from 43 million plays of happy on Pandora.

2409
02:16:36.520 --> 02:16:41.380
What the fuck?
What the fuck,

2410
02:16:41.381 --> 02:16:46.180
man?
Holy Shit.
That's like an onion sketch,
you know?

2411
02:16:46.181 --> 02:16:48.460
I mean,
that's like something the onion would write for an hour.
No big.

2412
02:16:48.461 --> 02:16:50.440
You have to be to make any kind of money.

2413
02:16:50.500 --> 02:16:55.500
$22,700 $2,700 for 43 million plays.

2414
02:16:57.220 --> 02:17:01.210
You know what?
Someone's going to start it.
Someone's got to start like a Pandora.

2415
02:17:01.300 --> 02:17:05.170
It's actually a musician.
Like an open source.
Yeah.
And say,
listen,

2416
02:17:05.171 --> 02:17:05.940
we're going to do this.

2417
02:17:05.940 --> 02:17:07.980
<v 9>It's called tidal Jay z and a bunch of other,</v>

2418
02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:09.540
I don't want to say all hip hop artists started it,

2419
02:17:09.541 --> 02:17:12.720
but they started something very similar.
Higher quality downloads.

2420
02:17:12.721 --> 02:17:15.360
It's you can pay $10 a month or $20 a month.

2421
02:17:16.020 --> 02:17:19.170
That's where that one Beyonce concert was for central park.

2422
02:17:19.171 --> 02:17:22.510
It was a special title.
Contracts.
We watched the artists make more,

2423
02:17:22.860 --> 02:17:24.090
supposedly they make more money,

2424
02:17:24.091 --> 02:17:27.030
but there was some backlash when that came out that are there people or fans

2425
02:17:27.031 --> 02:17:29.640
were staying like why do you need more money?
You already have money.

2426
02:17:29.760 --> 02:17:33.570
Let's let uh,
like uh,
independent artists get a chance to make some money.

2427
02:17:34.200 --> 02:17:34.970
It's really

2428
02:17:34.970 --> 02:17:36.950
<v 2>what,
is he getting all the money from it or is it,</v>

2429
02:17:36.951 --> 02:17:38.960
I don't quite little by little.
You see what,

2430
02:17:39.610 --> 02:17:41.630
what appears to be happening as little by little,

2431
02:17:41.631 --> 02:17:46.200
the artist is now because of the Internet is slowly the shift.

2432
02:17:46.201 --> 02:17:49.500
The power is going back to them.
Yes.
Yeah.
Cause once an hour.

2433
02:17:49.670 --> 02:17:52.790
Once you have followers and you can,
you can contact your fans.

2434
02:17:52.850 --> 02:17:54.980
You needed the record company to contact your friends.

2435
02:17:54.981 --> 02:17:56.370
How else are you going to contact your fans?

2436
02:17:56.420 --> 02:17:57.980
We don't even have cell phones back then.

2437
02:17:58.010 --> 02:18:01.490
Exactly what you need us to put you on the radio.

2438
02:18:02.420 --> 02:18:04.520
The radio head like really strict rules.

2439
02:18:04.550 --> 02:18:08.330
Like they had really strict relationships.
Radios lost all their power to man.

2440
02:18:08.510 --> 02:18:11.360
They're,
they're cutting budgets left and right.
Firing people.

2441
02:18:11.540 --> 02:18:13.610
You know Kevin and being are good friends of mine.
I do their show.

2442
02:18:13.611 --> 02:18:16.940
That's like the only,
the last tree terrestrial radio show I do.

2443
02:18:17.120 --> 02:18:19.700
They're really nice guys and I do their show and last time I was there,

2444
02:18:19.701 --> 02:18:22.340
been was there and he was telling me like they meet with like the upper

2445
02:18:22.341 --> 02:18:25.790
management but they're all,
everyone's negative.
It's all down.
It's all downer.

2446
02:18:25.910 --> 02:18:28.820
No one's like,
you guys are doing great.
It's such an enjoyable show.

2447
02:18:29.010 --> 02:18:31.850
Really appreciate that.
We're all working together.
Everyone's just like,
fuck,

2448
02:18:31.851 --> 02:18:35.690
we got to fire people.
We gotta cut tie.
It's like that business is,
it's a,
it's a,

2449
02:18:36.080 --> 02:18:38.240
it's a kind of a dying business.

2450
02:18:38.570 --> 02:18:42.810
It's like Morse code because now that you have your music on your phone and

2451
02:18:42.830 --> 02:18:46.250
stuff,
I remembered.
It seems like just yesterday where I'm driving around,

2452
02:18:46.251 --> 02:18:51.170
I always had 55 cds in the back of my costs.
People stepping on them,

2453
02:18:51.171 --> 02:18:54.950
there's always cds and once every couple of weeks I've got to fucking organize

2454
02:18:54.951 --> 02:18:58.040
my shit.
There's just cds now.
Your phone,
it's just your phone.

2455
02:18:58.070 --> 02:19:02.180
It's so much easier and it's both the man instantaneously.

2456
02:19:02.540 --> 02:19:04.850
You could always,
if you don't have something on iTunes or whatever,

2457
02:19:04.851 --> 02:19:07.910
you could always go to youtube and listen to on Youtube.
No,
it's incredible.

2458
02:19:07.911 --> 02:19:09.960
It's an amazing time for that.
And now people,

2459
02:19:10.010 --> 02:19:12.260
these guys that were like Radio Djs,

2460
02:19:12.320 --> 02:19:14.540
essentially what made them cool was their personalities.

2461
02:19:14.960 --> 02:19:18.770
But when you get trapped in a Dj Gig like that,
you know,

2462
02:19:18.771 --> 02:19:22.370
people get little snippets of your personality and your thought process on

2463
02:19:22.371 --> 02:19:26.330
things and then you play another song and then like,
I think for those guys it's,

2464
02:19:26.340 --> 02:19:28.040
it's like it would

2465
02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:30.440
<v 4>be way better served without a radio show.</v>

2466
02:19:30.740 --> 02:19:34.010
They'd be way better served just talking about shit because that's what people

2467
02:19:34.011 --> 02:19:36.800
enjoy about them.
Anybody could play those same records.

2468
02:19:37.070 --> 02:19:39.860
You could have a robot voice that plays the same records of the people that are

2469
02:19:39.861 --> 02:19:42.530
tuned in just for the music therapy.
Go ahead and do it brother.

2470
02:19:42.920 --> 02:19:44.720
That people that are tuning in just for the music,

2471
02:19:45.170 --> 02:19:48.830
those people are going to tune in no matter what.
That's what they want to hear.

2472
02:19:48.831 --> 02:19:52.130
They don't care about the personalities but the personalities like guys like

2473
02:19:52.131 --> 02:19:53.330
Kevin and being their fun dudes.

2474
02:19:53.331 --> 02:19:56.630
They're interesting guys and that's what is interesting about that show.

2475
02:19:56.930 --> 02:20:00.530
Like they would almost be better served if the radio station fire them and they

2476
02:20:00.531 --> 02:20:02.120
had to go and do an internet show.

2477
02:20:02.300 --> 02:20:05.000
Cause if they did an internet show would just be them talking about stuff and it

2478
02:20:05.001 --> 02:20:08.110
would be great.
I mean,
you know just be podcast.
These,

2479
02:20:08.210 --> 02:20:12.680
I think for the longest time was fucking really hard to get the Internet on your

2480
02:20:12.681 --> 02:20:13.760
phone.
You know,

2481
02:20:13.761 --> 02:20:17.600
you had to download shit it was and then three g came around get a little bit

2482
02:20:17.601 --> 02:20:20.750
better but then four g LTE came around.

2483
02:20:20.751 --> 02:20:25.160
It's like that shit is fast as fuck.
Instantaneous streaming.
Like,

2484
02:20:25.161 --> 02:20:28.070
if you want to listen to a song,
there's almost never a hiccup.

2485
02:20:28.280 --> 02:20:32.570
It's really easy and really quick to do.
That's like,
that's such a game changer,

2486
02:20:32.571 --> 02:20:34.030
man.
That's,
so

2487
02:20:34.370 --> 02:20:38.300
<v 9>if those,
if those djs there like a curator though,
where is it?
Where's the,</v>

2488
02:20:38.301 --> 02:20:42.430
where do you find your new music these days?
Like a that,

2489
02:20:42.470 --> 02:20:44.630
cause that's kind of like if you're,
if you're considered yourself,

2490
02:20:44.631 --> 02:20:47.900
I guess like the Twitter curator for sort of that kind of content.

2491
02:20:47.901 --> 02:20:51.260
And that's really,
really good point on music.

2492
02:20:51.450 --> 02:20:54.030
<v 4>That's a really good point.
That's why I'm so out of the fucking loop.</v>

2493
02:20:54.060 --> 02:20:55.950
I don't know anything people tell me about some guy,

2494
02:20:55.951 --> 02:20:58.320
like Eddie was talking about the King Daddy Guy.

2495
02:20:58.530 --> 02:21:01.560
Never heard of him until he talked about to date daddy Yankee and it's just a

2496
02:21:01.620 --> 02:21:04.080
daddy Yankee.
Okay,
well whatever.
I never heard of that either.

2497
02:21:04.320 --> 02:21:07.140
But think about that.
You know,
Eddie found out and he's like,

2498
02:21:07.141 --> 02:21:08.220
I can't believe this guy's huge.

2499
02:21:08.430 --> 02:21:11.190
I just found out from him in real time on the show.

2500
02:21:11.490 --> 02:21:15.630
Like there's so many people that no one has ever heard of that are gigantic.

2501
02:21:15.840 --> 02:21:17.220
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2502
02:21:17.240 --> 02:21:20.190
We're talking about that King Daddy guy like I didn't find out about until you

2503
02:21:20.191 --> 02:21:23.750
just said it is massive.
He's playing the staple center.
Crazy.

2504
02:21:23.790 --> 02:21:28.320
Like a movie staple center.
King Daddy.
Come on.

2505
02:21:28.350 --> 02:21:32.490
That sounds like a Chris rock movie.
Well,
it's a,
it's just an amazing time.

2506
02:21:32.700 --> 02:21:36.780
It's an amazing time.
It's amazing time for promotion.
It's amazing time for,

2507
02:21:37.470 --> 02:21:41.160
you know,
it's amazing time to do podcasts.
I mean,
podcasts.

2508
02:21:41.161 --> 02:21:44.280
This is the craziest time ever for podcasts.
It's this new thing.

2509
02:21:44.850 --> 02:21:47.250
I mean we've been,
we've been doing it for six years.

2510
02:21:47.280 --> 02:21:50.520
Next month it'll be December,
like December 30th or something like that.

2511
02:21:50.521 --> 02:21:53.520
It was six years in that time.

2512
02:21:53.640 --> 02:21:57.360
Podcasts have gone from being some shit that people did for a goof too.

2513
02:21:57.390 --> 02:22:01.050
One of the ways,
one of the few ways that I get entertainment,

2514
02:22:01.560 --> 02:22:06.120
it's like one of the major ways my major ways are like walking dead,

2515
02:22:06.390 --> 02:22:09.720
like shows like that that I'll watch at home.
Hunting shows,

2516
02:22:10.950 --> 02:22:14.070
MMA fights and podcasts,
those,

2517
02:22:14.071 --> 02:22:16.290
it's a major part of like what I listened to,

2518
02:22:16.291 --> 02:22:21.240
not my own shit but like radio lab,
the Ted Radio,

2519
02:22:21.241 --> 02:22:25.920
the Ted podcast,
our a hardcore history Ari show show.

2520
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:29.760
This is all these podcasts to listen to this always entertainment,
always,

2521
02:22:29.761 --> 02:22:31.470
constantly.
It's constant entertainment.

2522
02:22:31.920 --> 02:22:36.600
And I can't tell you how many fucking people I've talked to that say,
hey man,

2523
02:22:36.760 --> 02:22:38.100
listen to show him because your show,

2524
02:22:38.101 --> 02:22:42.900
we started our podcasts like anybody can do it.
Why not?
Why not?
If it's good,

2525
02:22:42.901 --> 02:22:45.750
if you have one person take a fucking chance on your podcast,

2526
02:22:45.751 --> 02:22:48.150
one person and they go,
this is pretty fucking good.

2527
02:22:48.300 --> 02:22:50.040
And they send it to their friend dude,
eyelids.
Listen,

2528
02:22:50.041 --> 02:22:51.240
he's got shoot the shit about shit.

2529
02:22:51.480 --> 02:22:54.930
Like we saw it the other day when we were talking about um,

2530
02:22:55.020 --> 02:22:57.900
Josh Olin who uh,
we had it on the podcast.

2531
02:22:58.020 --> 02:23:03.020
We both watched a podcast that had like 2000 downloads on youtube maybe,

2532
02:23:05.110 --> 02:23:08.700
but,
and it was over a year ago and Jamie and I both watched it.

2533
02:23:08.910 --> 02:23:11.070
We both watched it cause we wanted to see these guys take on it.

2534
02:23:11.070 --> 02:23:14.580
So these guys take on it,
which was intelligent.
They're funny guys.

2535
02:23:14.700 --> 02:23:17.820
They were there,
they had good points.
They,

2536
02:23:17.850 --> 02:23:22.140
they gave us like an insight into it through now because of that,

2537
02:23:22.350 --> 02:23:24.450
I'll see that podcast and I'll go,
oh,
these guys,

2538
02:23:24.451 --> 02:23:27.360
I remember these guys and that's what people do and then do,
do,
do,
do,
do.

2539
02:23:27.940 --> 02:23:30.980
Next thing you know,
you've got 100,000 downloads a month.
I mean,
that's,

2540
02:23:31.070 --> 02:23:35.730
that's not unusual.
That's like,
that's super possible and plausible.

2541
02:23:35.731 --> 02:23:39.390
Now all you have to do is focus on something and put together something that's

2542
02:23:39.391 --> 02:23:43.350
really good and unusual and we all have friends like my friend Dave Dolan who

2543
02:23:43.351 --> 02:23:46.050
just died.
Let me tell you something.
If that motherfucker was alive,

2544
02:23:46.320 --> 02:23:49.740
if he lived in La,
I'd have him on the podcast every week.

2545
02:23:49.920 --> 02:23:52.570
I'm kicking myself that I never had him on while he was alive,
but he didn't.

2546
02:23:52.571 --> 02:23:57.120
He never comes to La.
That guy would be hilarious on a podcast.

2547
02:23:57.121 --> 02:24:00.930
If someone gave him a podcast,
like the fucking investigator chronicles,

2548
02:24:01.140 --> 02:24:03.930
the private investigator chronicles and you just let him be himself.

2549
02:24:03.931 --> 02:24:07.580
He could figure out how to be himself.
God would be hilarious.
But if

2550
02:24:07.580 --> 02:24:10.460
<v 0>you could do stand up,
like in your podcast where you're talking,</v>

2551
02:24:10.461 --> 02:24:14.240
you're telling jokes and everyone's connected to your,
your headset,

2552
02:24:14.241 --> 02:24:15.670
so you could hear people laugh though.

2553
02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:19.890
They would also start yelling shit out and then you shut down as soon as they

2554
02:24:20.930 --> 02:24:24.740
heckle button.
Boom,
they're gone.
Yeah,
but you would have to find them.
I try.

2555
02:24:24.741 --> 02:24:26.240
Would you find pick them out?

2556
02:24:26.241 --> 02:24:28.250
I mean how many people are on the line at the same time?

2557
02:24:28.910 --> 02:24:33.470
You know if you had to have a show like like a voice recognizer yeah.

2558
02:24:33.471 --> 02:24:36.170
If you do a show in a theater with a thousand people,

2559
02:24:36.171 --> 02:24:39.110
it can actually be kind of intimate.
If you say anything other than laughing,

2560
02:24:39.111 --> 02:24:43.060
you've got to record all your labs and only those sounds can come out and hear

2561
02:24:43.061 --> 02:24:47.390
the sounds.
You got cut off.
You're like,
ah,
yeah you got to do is Manny.

2562
02:24:47.460 --> 02:24:49.620
Cause then you get cut off and you find out why he got cut off.

2563
02:24:49.621 --> 02:24:51.730
But you don't get that laugh in.
There you go.
I get that.

2564
02:24:51.780 --> 02:24:54.590
Have to be express themselves.
You want people to be able to express.

2565
02:24:55.160 --> 02:24:57.680
If there wasn't hecklers or people respected you,
how cool would that be?

2566
02:24:57.681 --> 02:25:01.810
Where you could hear it might be like three or four people listening to
podcasts.

2567
02:25:02.090 --> 02:25:03.710
It's totally possible conference call.

2568
02:25:03.711 --> 02:25:06.110
Really exactly like a giant conference call,

2569
02:25:06.111 --> 02:25:08.060
but the problem would be like what I was saying,

2570
02:25:08.090 --> 02:25:11.210
like you can have a show with a thousand people in the audience and it's kind of

2571
02:25:11.211 --> 02:25:13.600
intimate.
It is kind of intimate.
You can make it intimate.
Yeah,

2572
02:25:13.770 --> 02:25:17.270
but but you're all looking at each other and that's what people,

2573
02:25:17.300 --> 02:25:22.090
that's the way people are supposed to talk describing a Webcam show there is

2574
02:25:22.100 --> 02:25:22.933
that bad.

2575
02:25:25.890 --> 02:25:29.580
<v 3>You could do webcam sting.
Those guys don't talk.
There's no sound that true.</v>

2576
02:25:29.710 --> 02:25:30.543
I made that up.

2577
02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:33.730
Imagine if the girl was like listening to all those guys jerking off

2578
02:25:33.731 --> 02:25:34.660
simultaneously.

2579
02:25:35.380 --> 02:25:40.380
2,700 guys and use here instead of like an audience cheering and laughing.

2580
02:25:40.910 --> 02:25:43.040
You see here 2,700 groans.

2581
02:25:49.590 --> 02:25:54.190
Just 2,700 dudes you could hear is them jacking off simultaneously.

2582
02:25:57.220 --> 02:25:58.510
I'm going to have to turn you down.

2583
02:26:01.320 --> 02:26:05.410
Don't be so ridiculous.
That's coming now.
That's coming.
Watch.

2584
02:26:05.440 --> 02:26:08.450
We're supposed to look at each house to live in the big Joe.

2585
02:26:08.451 --> 02:26:10.840
We could just sit there and smoke.
He's kind of doing that on periscope.

2586
02:26:11.380 --> 02:26:14.140
The sound.
He gets those little hearts though.

2587
02:26:14.650 --> 02:26:18.370
Did you watch the Astros podcast?
No,
I heard it was predicted.

2588
02:26:18.371 --> 02:26:20.760
I wanted me to do acid.
I wouldn't do it.
I want you to do it.

2589
02:26:21.070 --> 02:26:22.600
I didn't want to do it,
man.
I'm not,

2590
02:26:23.410 --> 02:26:28.180
I'm not like attracted to that kind of um,
experience acid.

2591
02:26:28.870 --> 02:26:30.820
That doesn't sound good to me.
What does it sound like?

2592
02:26:30.930 --> 02:26:33.010
It sounds like a horrible time.
No,

2593
02:26:33.011 --> 02:26:35.050
I've heard it's a great like Dunkin swears by it.

2594
02:26:35.200 --> 02:26:37.760
Maybe just talk to Duncan about it.
I don't think I'm program for it.

2595
02:26:38.140 --> 02:26:43.140
It'll be tried it when I was a kid and it was like a synthetic mushroom feel.

2596
02:26:44.290 --> 02:26:45.910
I'd rather have the real mushrooms.

2597
02:26:45.970 --> 02:26:50.120
I'm down with mushrooms but not a synthetic form of what's in Russia.

2598
02:26:50.140 --> 02:26:54.580
That's what I think it is.
I think LSD and acid is a synthetic form of mushrooms.

2599
02:26:54.630 --> 02:26:57.320
Right?
Similar.

2600
02:26:57.350 --> 02:27:01.720
<v 4>There's similar like a lot of the trip to means they share like,
like,</v>

2601
02:27:02.600 --> 02:27:07.600
like silicide been is really close to DMT and the way it's synthesizes and the

2602
02:27:08.121 --> 02:27:11.360
Bonnie,
it's like super close.
Like I'm going to butcher this,

2603
02:27:11.361 --> 02:27:16.361
but it's like n and a diamond field trip to mean and uh,

2604
02:27:16.790 --> 02:27:21.790
I think what is the silicide and version of it for Fox for a lock and,

2605
02:27:22.211 --> 02:27:25.580
and dimethyltryptamine something like that.
Like it's real close.

2606
02:27:25.850 --> 02:27:28.730
It's like they're,
they're kissing cousins,
they're all those,

2607
02:27:28.790 --> 02:27:32.570
the really powerful tryptamines,
they're all like neighbors of each other.

2608
02:27:32.600 --> 02:27:35.820
It's a very strange,
and they're all the closest to human neuro chemistry.

2609
02:27:35.960 --> 02:27:38.930
One of the most fucked up things about the really powerful psychedelic drugs is

2610
02:27:38.931 --> 02:27:42.860
the strongest ones like mushrooms and like DMT.

2611
02:27:42.890 --> 02:27:47.540
DMT is the strongest.
It's like an actual human neuro transmitter.

2612
02:27:47.570 --> 02:27:49.910
I mean it's not even,
it's not even like an addition,

2613
02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.880
like he's not even in addition to,
it was actually produced in your own body.

2614
02:27:52.881 --> 02:27:57.320
That's the weirdest thing ever about drugs that the strongest one we know of

2615
02:27:57.321 --> 02:27:57.481
your,

2616
02:27:57.481 --> 02:28:02.481
your own body makes like the fact that data that most people don't know that the

2617
02:28:03.231 --> 02:28:06.020
fact that most people know the Kanye West,
he's married to Kim Kardashian.

2618
02:28:06.170 --> 02:28:10.340
Most people don't know that your brain produces the most powerful psychedelic

2619
02:28:10.490 --> 02:28:14.570
drug that science has ever observed.
That's a nutty thing,
man.

2620
02:28:14.900 --> 02:28:19.160
That is a weird,
weird aspect of who we are as as human being.

2621
02:28:19.161 --> 02:28:22.240
What kind of a strange waking infantiles

2622
02:28:22.250 --> 02:28:23.031
<v 2>civilization.</v>

2623
02:28:23.031 --> 02:28:28.031
We are in the middle of like the greatest era of technological innovation ever.

2624
02:28:31.220 --> 02:28:34.400
Why Phi?
The ability to download songs instantly on phones,

2625
02:28:34.401 --> 02:28:39.200
like we were talking about the periscoping and fucking just in insane ability to

2626
02:28:39.201 --> 02:28:44.030
connect with each other.
At this day and age,
we still have illegal marijuana,

2627
02:28:44.420 --> 02:28:46.100
illegal psychedelic drugs,

2628
02:28:46.220 --> 02:28:51.220
illegal drugs like Bill Gates or a Steve Jobs said that LSD was what led him to

2629
02:28:51.651 --> 02:28:52.484
create an apple.

2630
02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:55.460
He said it was like one of the most important moments of his life is having an

2631
02:28:55.461 --> 02:28:56.200
LSD trip.

2632
02:28:56.200 --> 02:28:58.130
<v 1>There's so many problems in this.</v>

2633
02:28:58.230 --> 02:29:01.540
World's did so many different levels coming from all different angles,

2634
02:29:01.541 --> 02:29:04.510
from all different forms of life.
There's so much shit.

2635
02:29:04.630 --> 02:29:07.360
Everyone's trying to fight this.
They're trying to fight that they're into this.

2636
02:29:07.361 --> 02:29:09.520
They're into that.
Everyone's got their own cars,

2637
02:29:09.910 --> 02:29:14.620
but if we all got together and do what we did with weed and and,

2638
02:29:14.621 --> 02:29:18.430
and the legislation and all that stuff,
he did that with just one thing.

2639
02:29:18.850 --> 02:29:21.910
One thing.
We just focused all our power.
It would fix everything.

2640
02:29:22.090 --> 02:29:24.190
If we made it a law that he,

2641
02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:27.510
every politician has to do Iowasca

2642
02:29:29.870 --> 02:29:32.630
<v 2>that'll fix all the prompts.
It would fix a lot if it would,</v>

2643
02:29:32.900 --> 02:29:35.930
even if that's too much law even that's too much work.

2644
02:29:36.050 --> 02:29:39.590
You have them have one DMT trip a month while they're in office.
Yeah.

2645
02:29:39.740 --> 02:29:41.990
Just to keep,
everybody has to have a ceremony.

2646
02:29:42.020 --> 02:29:45.410
You get together and you meet with the elves and they tell you whether or not

2647
02:29:45.411 --> 02:29:47.900
you're fucking up.
Yup.
One law that's all.

2648
02:29:48.080 --> 02:29:51.020
Forget about all this other shit and we're scattering just one thing.

2649
02:29:51.230 --> 02:29:54.680
Make them do mushrooms or DMT.
That's part of being a politician,

2650
02:29:54.740 --> 02:29:56.940
just to make sure that the,

2651
02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:01.190
the odds are that you'll have compassion for the people and not let your greed

2652
02:30:01.280 --> 02:30:04.690
yeah.
Over and be interviewed while you're under too.
You have to approve,

2653
02:30:04.800 --> 02:30:07.520
you have to have a witness and that's what a videotaped put 'em under.

2654
02:30:07.521 --> 02:30:09.100
Then talk to them about life.
Yeah.

2655
02:30:09.110 --> 02:30:11.580
Have a sham and break flying all these guys from Peru,

2656
02:30:14.260 --> 02:30:16.960
like,
dude,
some chiller,
like they're going to fake like the Peruvian.

2657
02:30:16.961 --> 02:30:20.840
There's gonna be all this fake Peruvian,
big money.
Big money now.

2658
02:30:20.841 --> 02:30:22.700
Now that's a big racket.
I hate to break it to you,

2659
02:30:22.701 --> 02:30:26.120
but those leopard clause that dude has for earrings,
dumb shits of plastic.

2660
02:30:26.180 --> 02:30:30.810
That's fake.
Homeboys fake what?
Leprechaun.
I'm saying.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2661
02:30:31.200 --> 02:30:33.980
She got a flashy,
bigger Mexicans.

2662
02:30:34.280 --> 02:30:37.130
It's just cheaper if we just fucking Mexican.
Peruvian.

2663
02:30:39.260 --> 02:30:41.480
Very strong.
But you can't,
yeah,
you gotta.
You know,

2664
02:30:41.481 --> 02:30:44.140
they got to kind of look at Hiawassee call you my costs.
Right.

2665
02:30:44.640 --> 02:30:49.090
The past is that bringing Brazilians they know,

2666
02:30:49.520 --> 02:30:51.330
but you know what money going to get them.

2667
02:30:51.900 --> 02:30:56.400
We're going to put the cop or just like,
oh man.
It's nice.
Everybody.
Nice.

2668
02:30:56.480 --> 02:30:58.980
You're going to sit and watch my gosh.
Oh my gosh.

2669
02:31:00.710 --> 02:31:03.290
Everything I do is for uh,

2670
02:31:03.440 --> 02:31:06.850
Iowasca I firefly WASC I live for and I was,

2671
02:31:07.620 --> 02:31:12.620
that was terrible.
That would change the world though.
It sounds like a junk.

2672
02:31:12.621 --> 02:31:13.610
But that would one law.

2673
02:31:13.720 --> 02:31:16.910
You imagine if you get like Dick Cheney and get them fucked up on mushrooms and

2674
02:31:16.911 --> 02:31:20.070
talk to them about life,
that would

2675
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:21.630
<v 4>be worth so much money.</v>

2676
02:31:21.810 --> 02:31:25.170
How much am I like all these like capitalist dude's that you'll want to make

2677
02:31:25.230 --> 02:31:26.790
some real money.
Donald Trump this week.

2678
02:31:26.850 --> 02:31:29.370
Do you eat five grams of mushrooms on a Webcam?

2679
02:31:29.700 --> 02:31:32.610
If Donald Trump will try to raise money for his campaign and,

2680
02:31:32.700 --> 02:31:36.960
and that's what he said.
That was his,
his big,
that was his big gimmick.

2681
02:31:37.140 --> 02:31:41.850
He's going to take five grams of mushrooms on a Webcam and just talk to Skype

2682
02:31:41.851 --> 02:31:45.210
with people from all over the world and answer their questions about what he's

2683
02:31:45.211 --> 02:31:47.640
going to do to fix the world.
His hair would light it on fire.

2684
02:31:48.060 --> 02:31:51.630
Spontaneous combustion probably shaved his head halfway into the conversation.

2685
02:31:51.990 --> 02:31:53.790
I can't,
I can't do this anymore.

2686
02:31:54.030 --> 02:31:58.170
He probably look at cotton candy on my head.

2687
02:31:58.171 --> 02:31:59.640
I can't fucking hang with this anymore,

2688
02:31:59.850 --> 02:32:04.830
but I think that if you could do something like that just and make it something

2689
02:32:04.831 --> 02:32:08.940
that would be culturally acceptable,
like it sounds ridiculous now,
oh,

2690
02:32:08.941 --> 02:32:11.460
we're going to send the fucking presidential candidates down to the jungle and

2691
02:32:11.461 --> 02:32:14.010
make them do some drugs.
Like it sounds ridiculous,
right?

2692
02:32:14.160 --> 02:32:15.390
But if there was a culturally,

2693
02:32:15.600 --> 02:32:18.120
it's the only ridiculous because you have to leave the country,

2694
02:32:18.270 --> 02:32:21.060
which doesn't make any sense if you do DMT,
right?

2695
02:32:21.090 --> 02:32:24.300
One of the things that you feel is that you're not even there.

2696
02:32:24.450 --> 02:32:28.380
You've entered into some completely different dimension.

2697
02:32:28.530 --> 02:32:33.530
Some alternative coexisting universe is what it feels like you step into.

2698
02:32:33.960 --> 02:32:38.280
It doesn't matter if you do that in Peru or in Japan or on the moon.

2699
02:32:38.310 --> 02:32:40.320
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

2700
02:32:40.350 --> 02:32:44.040
Like where you're going is has nothing to do with where you are.

2701
02:32:44.190 --> 02:32:45.750
It really has nothing to do with it.

2702
02:32:46.680 --> 02:32:49.650
It's only because it's illegal that people were forced to go to these indigenous

2703
02:32:49.651 --> 02:32:51.810
cultures and do it there.
If it was legal,

2704
02:32:52.200 --> 02:32:56.820
you can have a shamanically retreat center in America and people could go to a

2705
02:32:56.821 --> 02:33:01.821
shamanically retreat center and it could be treated just as respective as going

2706
02:33:01.891 --> 02:33:03.120
to,
you know,
whatever.

2707
02:33:03.120 --> 02:33:08.120
A psychiatrist or just as respected as going to a fucking a cancer doctor,

2708
02:33:09.571 --> 02:33:13.290
an oncologist or anybody.
Just getting your body checked out.
One of the only cut,

2709
02:33:13.320 --> 02:33:18.320
there's one of the only countries on the planet where Iowasca is praised and uh,

2710
02:33:19.080 --> 02:33:24.080
legal is the same country where they take a month off from work and party

2711
02:33:25.081 --> 02:33:29.970
straight.
Where's that?
Where's that Brazil.
They took a month off the carnival.

2712
02:33:29.971 --> 02:33:33.070
They just partied for a lunch.
Totally legal in Brazil.
I'll,
I'll,

2713
02:33:33.160 --> 02:33:38.040
I'll get totally legal.
The UN trying to impose some shit and they're like,
dude,

2714
02:33:38.041 --> 02:33:42.000
fuck you.
You're not taking away.
I lost it.
Damn it.
We should move to Brazil,
dude.

2715
02:33:42.001 --> 02:33:43.360
Think about that dude.

2716
02:33:43.540 --> 02:33:46.090
Do you know how long have you had to take us to learn Portuguese?
Oh,

2717
02:33:46.760 --> 02:33:49.200
do you think I could do stand up?
I'll if I learned Portuguese.

2718
02:33:49.201 --> 02:33:50.250
Are you stand them in Brazil?

2719
02:33:50.340 --> 02:33:52.830
So like have you ever thought about end of the world scenarios?

2720
02:33:53.100 --> 02:33:55.080
If your thought about like if yellow's don't blows up,

2721
02:33:55.081 --> 02:33:59.100
where are you going to move?
I'm moving to Brazil.
Either Brazil or Australia.

2722
02:33:59.730 --> 02:34:02.610
Those are the spots.
Australia be way easier.
Everybody speaks English.

2723
02:34:02.760 --> 02:34:05.640
I just get to get used to the wrong side of the road or convinced them to drive

2724
02:34:05.641 --> 02:34:08.380
on the correct side of the road,
which would probably be better.
10 planets.

2725
02:34:08.440 --> 02:34:11.280
How American's thick I if I go to Australia I'm going to tell him,

2726
02:34:11.281 --> 02:34:15.060
listen faggots who stopped driving the left driving the right like a fucking

2727
02:34:15.061 --> 02:34:18.130
normal.
We invented the car.
I'll 10 planet

2728
02:34:18.130 --> 02:34:22.210
<v 2>floor Annapolis.
Yeah that's going to happen.
Why not?
But do you think,</v>

2729
02:34:23.140 --> 02:34:23.600
is it,

2730
02:34:23.600 --> 02:34:27.070
is it possible that you could see like the shit hitting the fan and moving to

2731
02:34:27.071 --> 02:34:29.440
another country?
Have you ever considered that?
Yes.

2732
02:34:29.740 --> 02:34:34.030
Where are you considered moving to?
Australia is nice.

2733
02:34:34.300 --> 02:34:36.760
Very nice.
You live in Melbourne's like Santa Monica.

2734
02:34:36.761 --> 02:34:38.410
I'm going there tomorrow for the first time.

2735
02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:41.860
My first time in Melbourne is Sydney's really nice.
I love Sydney.

2736
02:34:41.861 --> 02:34:46.330
Sydney is awesome.
They're cool as fuck.
They're,

2737
02:34:46.480 --> 02:34:49.840
they're real friendly,
very westernized,
very westernized.

2738
02:34:49.870 --> 02:34:52.240
Like you could totally fit right in there.

2739
02:34:52.241 --> 02:34:56.140
Like if you had to live in Sydney or the one place I've been,
but I'd be like,

2740
02:34:56.141 --> 02:34:59.560
yeah,
that's just like living in a nice city in America where people have a cool

2741
02:34:59.561 --> 02:35:04.420
accent.
Tell it would be it,
you know?
Did you go with me to Australia ever?

2742
02:35:04.450 --> 02:35:06.970
Did you ever do one?
The EOC is out this.
That's right.

2743
02:35:06.971 --> 02:35:11.530
Remember when we took over that bar and got blasted?
Yes.
Oh my God.

2744
02:35:11.590 --> 02:35:15.280
Joe went nuts.
He bought the whole bar drinks and oh my God.

2745
02:35:15.310 --> 02:35:19.930
Did we spend thousands of dollars?
I went crazy.

2746
02:35:20.350 --> 02:35:23.740
We just decided it was me and Tommy Segura and Eddie.

2747
02:35:23.920 --> 02:35:26.420
We had a whole day off,
so we went to see a,

2748
02:35:26.470 --> 02:35:29.320
that Leonardo DiCaprio movie where they trick you,

2749
02:35:29.560 --> 02:35:34.150
where he pretends you know it's all a dream.
No,
no,
no.

2750
02:35:34.151 --> 02:35:36.990
It was the other one.
Shutter island.
Yeah,
the island one.

2751
02:35:37.360 --> 02:35:40.660
We're both mad for all three of us.
We're mad.
We're like,
what the fuck?

2752
02:35:40.661 --> 02:35:43.420
You can't just do that.
Oh,
it was just a dream psych,

2753
02:35:44.950 --> 02:35:47.850
stupid fuck your dream.
And so perfect.

2754
02:35:47.880 --> 02:35:52.880
It's like one of the only times ever in my life that we just made a decision to

2755
02:35:54.461 --> 02:35:57.820
get drunk.
Like,
let's go get drunk.
Like,
let's go to a bar,

2756
02:35:57.821 --> 02:36:01.360
let's find a bar and get fucked up.
And we're like,
yeah,
let's do it.

2757
02:36:01.480 --> 02:36:05.050
We just all decided to go get fucked up.
Like there was nothing else to do.

2758
02:36:05.350 --> 02:36:08.140
There was a,
you know,
I didn't have a show until the next day.

2759
02:36:08.530 --> 02:36:12.730
So we went to this bar and just went off.
He just bought everybody drinks.

2760
02:36:12.760 --> 02:36:15.790
Everybody kept buying shots.
We bought hundreds of shots.

2761
02:36:15.791 --> 02:36:19.450
I don't even know how much money I spent.
It was insane.
We would literally,

2762
02:36:19.451 --> 02:36:22.790
we're just buying people drinks and high five and people and hugging people.

2763
02:36:24.050 --> 02:36:28.600
It was nuts.
It was nuts.
We stay there for hours.
We were racked.

2764
02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:32.950
That was about as drunk as I've ever gotten as a grown man.
And then,
uh,

2765
02:36:32.951 --> 02:36:35.650
went back to the hotel room.
I think I threw up,
I don't remember.

2766
02:36:36.010 --> 02:36:39.980
And then the next day we had a show.
I think that was Joe Stevenson.
George Sada,

2767
02:36:39.981 --> 02:36:44.650
rob bliss.
Was it,
what was the main event that,
I don't know.

2768
02:36:46.330 --> 02:36:49.840
God,
there's so many fights now.
It's crazy.
It's crazy.

2769
02:36:49.841 --> 02:36:52.390
How many or are shit,
it's impossible.

2770
02:36:52.600 --> 02:36:57.430
You she fee toward just take out Dan Henderson again,
head kick.
Damn.

2771
02:36:57.431 --> 02:36:59.420
Who would ever thought whoever thought,
you know,

2772
02:36:59.610 --> 02:37:01.780
at one point that was only one Brazilian.

2773
02:37:01.781 --> 02:37:06.550
They could box and his veto Morillo could box too.
And uh,

2774
02:37:07.500 --> 02:37:11.060
I think himso could box a little bit.
He had good,
you know,

2775
02:37:11.170 --> 02:37:12.340
if he towards kicks though,

2776
02:37:12.360 --> 02:37:15.680
they have changed his whole game because vittores towards always had hamper,

2777
02:37:15.681 --> 02:37:16.250
you know,
vittores

2778
02:37:16.250 --> 02:37:20.180
<v 4>had like seven hand operations.
Yeah.
He's broken his hands like seven times.</v>

2779
02:37:20.240 --> 02:37:25.220
So what do you think about
him being off TRT?

2780
02:37:25.430 --> 02:37:26.930
What do you think about that?
Well,

2781
02:37:27.290 --> 02:37:31.930
the reality is okay if it's not often,
if,
here's my,
my,

2782
02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:36.350
if he really needed it so bad that he said he needed it before and uh,

2783
02:37:36.351 --> 02:37:37.520
it was a medical issue.

2784
02:37:37.530 --> 02:37:41.450
His body was low on testosterone and he had to take it and then he took it and

2785
02:37:41.451 --> 02:37:45.310
there's just destroying everybody,
like looked like a world beater.
Like God damn,

2786
02:37:45.320 --> 02:37:46.430
remember when Vito was,

2787
02:37:46.810 --> 02:37:50.660
you got to think that he's probably fighting with load tests for a long time,

2788
02:37:50.900 --> 02:37:55.160
like the Matt Lindland days and a couple of days maybe even Sakharova fight like

2789
02:37:55.170 --> 02:37:57.350
no low test,
low testosterone.

2790
02:37:57.680 --> 02:38:01.190
Maybe remember we got off the guy when he was 19 and then Randy couture,

2791
02:38:01.220 --> 02:38:02.810
but okay,
that's true.

2792
02:38:02.811 --> 02:38:05.360
But do you ever see what he looked like when he fought rich Franklin?

2793
02:38:05.630 --> 02:38:09.710
He knocked out rich Franklin,
but go to rich Franklin versus Vito Belfort.

2794
02:38:10.310 --> 02:38:14.840
No,
no.
He smooth dude.
He doesn't look shredded at all.

2795
02:38:15.040 --> 02:38:17.000
And he's still bombing on rich Franklin.

2796
02:38:17.240 --> 02:38:20.000
He still had the skills and everything that he had,
but it's,

2797
02:38:20.001 --> 02:38:23.120
I think it might've been one of the reasons why he fade so quickly.

2798
02:38:23.450 --> 02:38:24.560
One of the reasons why he,

2799
02:38:24.561 --> 02:38:28.370
it's hard for him to sustain like a hard pace without the TRT.

2800
02:38:28.850 --> 02:38:32.630
And I think that a fight like the Dan Henderson fight points to the fact that

2801
02:38:32.631 --> 02:38:36.320
he's still super dangerous.
He's got nasty skills and really fast as fuck,

2802
02:38:36.321 --> 02:38:40.640
but he didn't do anything.
Look at them there.
Yeah,
I am against rich Franklin.

2803
02:38:40.760 --> 02:38:42.740
Look at his body.
I mean he's like real smooth.

2804
02:38:42.890 --> 02:38:46.580
I mean it doesn't look like a pipsqueak.
He still looks like an athlete for sure,

2805
02:38:46.700 --> 02:38:50.480
but it doesn't look like Vitorin the TRT days.
Not even fuck is this,

2806
02:38:51.560 --> 02:38:55.030
this is,
no,
this is before TRT.
See,
he's lost.

2807
02:38:55.060 --> 02:38:59.720
He fought like this and then he fought a Anderson and then and all the way,

2808
02:38:59.750 --> 02:39:02.960
by the way,
this is all after he tested positive for steroids.

2809
02:39:02.961 --> 02:39:07.710
The first time he fought in pride in uh,

2810
02:39:07.730 --> 02:39:10.400
Vegas.
He tested positive for steroids.
When he fought,

2811
02:39:10.430 --> 02:39:12.230
I think it was Dan Henderson.
He lost that fight.

2812
02:39:12.231 --> 02:39:16.460
But he tested positive for something.
Some metabolites.
No,
that was pride.

2813
02:39:16.850 --> 02:39:19.190
They don't test.
They did when they were in Vegas.

2814
02:39:19.250 --> 02:39:20.750
Well they had the one show in the United States.

2815
02:39:20.751 --> 02:39:22.100
They test it and that's the one show it.

2816
02:39:22.101 --> 02:39:24.410
Nikki has got popped fighting gummy member.

2817
02:39:24.620 --> 02:39:27.650
He got popped for weed and v tour got popped for steroids.

2818
02:39:28.130 --> 02:39:31.130
So when the side effect of using steroids,

2819
02:39:31.131 --> 02:39:35.090
and this is one of the reasons why a lot of people are against testosterone

2820
02:39:35.091 --> 02:39:39.050
replacement therapy for fighters,
is that when you use steroids,

2821
02:39:39.080 --> 02:39:42.950
your body stops producing testosterone on its own.
So you could get tested.

2822
02:39:43.160 --> 02:39:45.470
The steroids have since left your body,
but your body is not,

2823
02:39:45.471 --> 02:39:48.560
the endocrine system hasn't recovered yet.
So you go to the doctor and you go,

2824
02:39:48.561 --> 02:39:51.500
hey man,
I hear it's really low testosterone.
It doctors like we certainly do,

2825
02:39:51.501 --> 02:39:54.350
this is proof positive.
We have it here on the blood,
they do a blood test,

2826
02:39:54.351 --> 02:39:57.230
they get the results and they put the results against the commission and they

2827
02:39:57.231 --> 02:40:02.150
say,
hey this guy needs test.
And so they give him a testosterone,
a use exemption,

2828
02:40:02.180 --> 02:40:04.790
a t you eat.
And that was what all these fighters were getting.

2829
02:40:05.150 --> 02:40:08.940
But the complaints from the people that were clean or you know,

2830
02:40:08.950 --> 02:40:12.050
wanted everybody to be clean,
you know,
allegedly were clean I should say.

2831
02:40:12.440 --> 02:40:15.720
Was that the only reason why these guys have low test in their early thirties

2832
02:40:15.840 --> 02:40:16.740
like you know some of these guys,

2833
02:40:16.741 --> 02:40:20.250
like they had a guy that was 25 that was on testosterone replacement and they

2834
02:40:20.251 --> 02:40:21.900
liked the old and he looked like a tank.

2835
02:40:22.090 --> 02:40:26.250
And the only way a guy would need this at that age is if he abused the system.

2836
02:40:26.610 --> 02:40:29.550
If he took testosterone and fucked up his endocrine system.

2837
02:40:29.880 --> 02:40:33.540
So that was like the big argument against the testosterone use exemption.

2838
02:40:33.660 --> 02:40:34.770
So if you look at him right there,

2839
02:40:34.771 --> 02:40:38.820
now pull up Vito Belfort verses Luke Rockhold.

2840
02:40:39.120 --> 02:40:42.770
And this is a totally different animal.
I mean this doesn't even he,

2841
02:40:42.780 --> 02:40:44.610
this is like two years later,
right?

2842
02:40:44.850 --> 02:40:49.630
And he doesn't look remotely like the same guy.
I mean,
he looks like a Goddamn,

2843
02:40:49.650 --> 02:40:51.330
this was at the weigh ins by the way,

2844
02:40:51.690 --> 02:40:55.140
the weigh ins go up where he's throwing that.
We'll kick right there.
Bam.

2845
02:40:55.290 --> 02:41:00.030
Look at the fucking difference in his build,
Dude.

2846
02:41:00.120 --> 02:41:04.620
I mean,
what the fuck?
This is the same weight class.

2847
02:41:04.680 --> 02:41:05.490
Okay.

2848
02:41:05.490 --> 02:41:10.230
But he looks like he's fuck at least 10 pounds of muscle.
Bigger,

2849
02:41:10.470 --> 02:41:14.510
completely shredded.
That 10 pounds of muscle,
Luke Rockhold.
Yup.

2850
02:41:14.640 --> 02:41:18.330
That's after you smashed Luke Rockhold.
And so he was on TRT here.
Yes,

2851
02:41:18.331 --> 02:41:21.120
he was [inaudible] Gal.
Well,

2852
02:41:21.150 --> 02:41:24.030
I think Vitara ITRT fucking looks fantastic.

2853
02:41:24.270 --> 02:41:28.800
I think Vitara on TRT is one of the scariest fighters the MMA world has ever

2854
02:41:28.801 --> 02:41:31.380
seen.
It's crazy.
And I would have fighting and at that level,

2855
02:41:31.410 --> 02:41:34.170
and it's the highest level.
He's the only guy left.
Nope.
Yeah.

2856
02:41:34.220 --> 02:41:35.790
And he met Josh Barnett.
He,

2857
02:41:35.791 --> 02:41:38.660
I would have loved to have seen v toward like this tea,

2858
02:41:38.661 --> 02:41:42.930
RTV tor versus Weidman to your TV tour versus Anderson Silva.

2859
02:41:43.170 --> 02:41:45.780
I would've loved to see it.
I understand that it's not fair.

2860
02:41:45.900 --> 02:41:49.050
And I wouldn't expect Weidman to take that fight if he knew that [inaudible] was

2861
02:41:49.051 --> 02:41:52.500
on TRT.
I wouldn't expect it,
but Goddamn,
I would have loved to have seen it.

2862
02:41:52.530 --> 02:41:56.790
And no way Luke Rockhold is on TRT.
No Way.
Right?
Well,

2863
02:41:56.960 --> 02:42:00.450
even never say no way because guys have tested positive that looked absolutely

2864
02:42:00.451 --> 02:42:01.260
like shit.

2865
02:42:01.260 --> 02:42:04.470
You never know because they look like shit and the testosterone makes them look

2866
02:42:04.471 --> 02:42:05.251
a little bit better,

2867
02:42:05.251 --> 02:42:07.910
or the whatever they're taking makes them look a little bit better.

2868
02:42:07.940 --> 02:42:10.920
Sharma's bigger.
Look at his arm and then look at B12.
RUCC.

2869
02:42:10.950 --> 02:42:13.740
Rockhold first of all is taller,
so if he's going to weigh the same amount,

2870
02:42:13.741 --> 02:42:17.250
he's going to have less muscle.
There's just no way around it.
It'll be longer.

2871
02:42:17.251 --> 02:42:20.220
And look,
he gets a lot of harm right there.
Holy Shit.
Oh my God,
he's so,

2872
02:42:20.221 --> 02:42:24.450
Jack's like Mark Kerr,
but Luke Rockhold is a fucking savage.

2873
02:42:24.451 --> 02:42:26.220
I mean that dude's a stud.

2874
02:42:26.640 --> 02:42:30.840
He's one of the toughest guys in the sport and real smart,

2875
02:42:30.841 --> 02:42:35.610
real technical.
But TRT v Two r ran him over,
TRT v tore wheel,

2876
02:42:35.611 --> 02:42:39.270
kicked him in the fucking head and beat him down and he beat down Dan Henderson

2877
02:42:39.271 --> 02:42:43.100
like that.
He knocked out Michael Bisping with a head kick and fucked his eye up

2878
02:42:43.101 --> 02:42:43.920
permanently.

2879
02:42:43.920 --> 02:42:48.120
Michael Bisping's eye is permanently disfigured because of [inaudible] kicking

2880
02:42:48.121 --> 02:42:49.710
him in the head.
This is like,

2881
02:42:49.711 --> 02:42:53.220
he's one of the scariest guys in the history of the sport.
When he was on TRT,

2882
02:42:53.221 --> 02:42:57.990
it was like a four fight run or he was just fucking smashing people.

2883
02:42:58.230 --> 02:43:01.470
And that Dan Henderson fight was one of the most devastating cause it wasn't

2884
02:43:01.471 --> 02:43:02.220
just the kick.

2885
02:43:02.220 --> 02:43:06.810
He had uncorked a fucking left uppercut before that kick hurt him real bad.

2886
02:43:06.930 --> 02:43:08.490
And then head kicked him and knocked him out.

2887
02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:11.680
He was a fucking terrifying when he was on TRT.

2888
02:43:12.250 --> 02:43:13.480
<v 2>So he's more tentative now.</v>

2889
02:43:13.481 --> 02:43:17.290
He didn't do a single thing for the first two minutes in this fight.

2890
02:43:17.650 --> 02:43:21.460
He literally didn't throw a punch or a kick.
He just circled for two minutes.

2891
02:43:21.730 --> 02:43:24.310
And then,
you know,
Dan threw a couple inside leg kicks.

2892
02:43:24.311 --> 02:43:27.820
There was a couple of little whiffs,
you know,
nothing really connected.

2893
02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:32.350
And then v torches on corks.
That head kick.
So the question is,

2894
02:43:32.351 --> 02:43:33.430
when you look at v tour now,

2895
02:43:33.431 --> 02:43:36.970
he definitely looks better in this fight that he did in the Weidman fight.

2896
02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:40.810
He looked more built,
but he still didn't look like he looked when he was on TRT.

2897
02:43:41.260 --> 02:43:45.510
So even if he had,
look at that shot down,
was punching Dan Henderson in the head.

2898
02:43:45.520 --> 02:43:50.410
Look at that.
Jesus fucking Christ build on him.
Dude,

2899
02:43:50.680 --> 02:43:53.470
he looks like a lion.
Look at his neck like,

2900
02:43:53.471 --> 02:43:57.370
look at the fucking traps on this guy when he's throwing this punch and he's

2901
02:43:57.371 --> 02:44:00.460
connecting perfectly on Dan Henderson's.
John,
that shot.

2902
02:44:00.461 --> 02:44:04.840
That is a classic picture.
He was a monster dude,

2903
02:44:05.950 --> 02:44:08.650
but the question is like,
what is he doing now?
How's he?

2904
02:44:08.770 --> 02:44:11.620
If he needed testosterone replacement before,
like how was he,

2905
02:44:12.440 --> 02:44:14.920
how was his body recovered like this?
Like what does he,

2906
02:44:14.921 --> 02:44:19.660
is it as he figured out some nutritional way to get around it or is he figuring

2907
02:44:19.661 --> 02:44:23.320
out some undetectable way to use no one else,
you know,

2908
02:44:23.350 --> 02:44:26.560
we're not going to know unless he gets caught based on what his body looked like

2909
02:44:26.561 --> 02:44:29.740
in his last fight against Dan Henderson.
W would you,

2910
02:44:29.770 --> 02:44:33.970
do you think his body looks like he's not on it or definitely doesn't look like

2911
02:44:34.810 --> 02:44:36.160
Tim Kennedy said it was best.

2912
02:44:36.460 --> 02:44:39.040
He said it doesn't look like vittores is using as many steroids.

2913
02:44:40.720 --> 02:44:43.480
Tip Kennedy's hilarious.
He said he wanted to fight the slow.

2914
02:44:43.481 --> 02:44:46.840
I'm interested in the fight.
He said with a slower fat or fee door.
Meanwhile,

2915
02:44:46.841 --> 02:44:50.620
it looks like he does steroids too.
Well to generate,
he's a tank at dude.

2916
02:44:51.030 --> 02:44:55.570
I'm not saying he does,
but fuck is yoked Danny's five,
10.

2917
02:44:55.600 --> 02:44:59.950
He walks around at 220 pounds.
[inaudible] steroids and I'm saying I got out.

2918
02:44:59.980 --> 02:45:04.060
I wouldn't be like,
oh my God.
I know.
Right.
Well you know,

2919
02:45:04.720 --> 02:45:07.330
who the fuck knows?
Who knows who's doing it?
Who's not doing it?

2920
02:45:07.630 --> 02:45:11.590
It's w I'm a fan of has not by the line Tim Kennedy.
That was a compliment.

2921
02:45:12.010 --> 02:45:16.780
It's a compliment I think.
Um,
you know,
I just did it.

2922
02:45:17.170 --> 02:45:21.250
Did that,
you know why I say I don't like that?
Like I think like,
um,

2923
02:45:21.251 --> 02:45:25.810
like can you,
uh,
control what we see or is he controlling?

2924
02:45:25.811 --> 02:45:29.590
We can do it if we set it up,
I can connect to apple TV in the future for you,

2925
02:45:29.591 --> 02:45:32.840
man.
If you could just,
cause you're really good at looking through shit.
Yeah,

2926
02:45:32.900 --> 02:45:33.910
but it's distracting.

2927
02:45:33.940 --> 02:45:37.150
It's better to have Jamie do it because I like to engage with the person I'm

2928
02:45:37.151 --> 02:45:41.080
talking to.
I don't want to look down and type shit in.
I'd do that occasionally,

2929
02:45:41.110 --> 02:45:45.910
but I think it's best.
We figured out a rhythm.
Yeah,
I get it.

2930
02:45:45.911 --> 02:45:48.340
I got to get out how to do this shit.
But um,

2931
02:45:48.670 --> 02:45:53.670
so Rhonda is fighting in Australia in front of 70,000 people this weekend,

2932
02:45:54.100 --> 02:45:58.030
that's for sure.
70.
Yeah.
Well they had sold like as of a couple of weeks ago.

2933
02:45:58.031 --> 02:45:59.900
They were already like 50,000 tickets sold.

2934
02:46:00.280 --> 02:46:03.490
Remember those people who thought Rod let women's MMA would never make it.

2935
02:46:03.491 --> 02:46:06.100
How about Dana?
It was so many people didn't think so.

2936
02:46:06.220 --> 02:46:10.340
It has to be someone like her though.
What's interesting is like a Yolana,

2937
02:46:10.430 --> 02:46:13.730
<v 3>the strawweight champion.
She's like scarier than Rhonda.</v>

2938
02:46:13.880 --> 02:46:17.120
When she beats people up,
she smashes her face.
And for me,

2939
02:46:17.390 --> 02:46:19.910
and I think a big part of the reason,

2940
02:46:19.940 --> 02:46:23.930
there are those people that that thought a women's MMA would never make it and

2941
02:46:23.931 --> 02:46:24.950
they still holding onto that.

2942
02:46:24.951 --> 02:46:28.170
They think that Rhonda was just a freak in the after her.
It's over there.

2943
02:46:28.171 --> 02:46:30.330
So it's still some people.
But the reason was I,

2944
02:46:30.410 --> 02:46:33.170
everyone kind of thought that at first too,
because in the beginning,

2945
02:46:33.171 --> 02:46:37.820
back in late 99 2000 the girls that were doing MMA had no skill.

2946
02:46:37.821 --> 02:46:41.880
They had nothing.
They were so,
it looked like,
man,
girls really can't fight.
They,

2947
02:46:42.200 --> 02:46:46.310
I even doubted it.
But that one time in Vegas where we,
when I forget what show,

2948
02:46:46.311 --> 02:46:49.700
it was tough.
It was tough enough and there was some girls going,
I'm like,

2949
02:46:49.730 --> 02:46:53.330
Holy Shit.
So much fun right there.

2950
02:46:53.330 --> 02:46:57.680
That's when I became pro female MMA.
That's when I thought,

2951
02:46:57.710 --> 02:47:02.450
wow girl,
people like watching girls pull their hair and,
and scratch each other.

2952
02:47:02.451 --> 02:47:05.330
We like watching that.
We'll watch out on a second big,
you know,

2953
02:47:06.260 --> 02:47:09.410
we watched it on Worldstar was at a time we went there to see nick the goat

2954
02:47:09.411 --> 02:47:13.640
Thompson fight member.
He was the main event.
That's right.
Yeah,

2955
02:47:13.760 --> 02:47:17.660
like Thompson.
That's interesting too.
I forget who that girl was.
Smart Guy.

2956
02:47:17.661 --> 02:47:20.510
He was like a law student.
Put your cap legit Jujitsu.

2957
02:47:20.570 --> 02:47:23.540
That's the first time I saw legit ah,

2958
02:47:23.770 --> 02:47:27.810
Jujitsu and a women's MMA fight.
I don't know.
It was like 2098,

2959
02:47:27.811 --> 02:47:31.790
nine and then,
uh,
and then with Jeff Osborne,
did you know he,

2960
02:47:31.791 --> 02:47:35.560
he's the original in victim who can shoot?
Yeah.
Yeah.

2961
02:47:36.330 --> 02:47:39.860
Well Osborne put on Eve Edwards versus,
uh,

2962
02:47:40.280 --> 02:47:41.540
Aaron Riley,

2963
02:47:41.600 --> 02:47:45.820
Aaron Riley in like 90 fucking six or some shit.

2964
02:47:46.390 --> 02:47:50.060
When was that fight?
I don't remember the year,
but it was like,
it was 99,

2965
02:47:50.061 --> 02:47:53.870
maybe not the same era of Mecca.
And uh,

2966
02:47:53.910 --> 02:47:57.600
remember the valley Tuto the Ivc those days,

2967
02:47:57.820 --> 02:48:02.180
the Pedro Pedro,
that's,
that's like,
uh,
you know,

2968
02:48:02.181 --> 02:48:04.160
talking about those days.
It's like in,
in metal.

2969
02:48:04.161 --> 02:48:07.040
That's the equivalent to the German thrash scene.
It's just like that.

2970
02:48:07.041 --> 02:48:11.370
Remember that Mecca and IVC to most people don't know what that is.

2971
02:48:11.390 --> 02:48:12.111
You remember that dude?

2972
02:48:12.111 --> 02:48:16.590
The Pedro Gary Goodrich reached down in his pants and grabbed his dick.
Yeah,

2973
02:48:16.591 --> 02:48:18.220
I made Derrick may carry Goodrich,

2974
02:48:18.240 --> 02:48:22.310
reached down and crushed his guys balls and with happy with his feet and his

2975
02:48:22.311 --> 02:48:26.180
hands too though.
Right?
He did it with his feet only with his feet.
I tell you,

2976
02:48:26.181 --> 02:48:30.320
I'll tell you what,
Eddie Bravo
turned his nuts into peanut butter.

2977
02:48:30.910 --> 02:48:34.870
That's some fun.
That's what he said.
Word for word guys can get there.

2978
02:48:36.110 --> 02:48:39.020
Pedro versus very good Ridge nut shot.
Yeah.

2979
02:48:39.270 --> 02:48:43.700
The Pedro versus Gary Goodridge.
Uh,

2980
02:48:43.790 --> 02:48:48.440
not smash.
Yeah,
testicle crunch.
He loved it.

2981
02:48:48.500 --> 02:48:51.500
You were allowed to do that back in the day.
Grab the ropes.

2982
02:48:51.660 --> 02:48:55.670
Keith Hackney versus Joe Sohn had Joe Sansai controlled Josiah and held onto the

2983
02:48:55.671 --> 02:48:58.520
head the head lock.
It was before the von flue choke was invented.

2984
02:48:58.540 --> 02:49:02.540
Punching his ball.
He's just wailing on his balls wailing on his ball.

2985
02:49:02.541 --> 02:49:06.020
That's the new era.
Eventually it's going to be MMA were balls or legal.

2986
02:49:06.260 --> 02:49:08.130
God damn the balls are in play.

2987
02:49:08.130 --> 02:49:13.130
<v 0>The game we had that sketch religious extreme sacrifice.</v>

2988
02:49:13.500 --> 02:49:16.440
That's the next lobby was going to be the champ cause he had the littlest balls.

2989
02:49:16.470 --> 02:49:21.170
Dude,
you make,
you make,
you make em ball shots,
legal and,

2990
02:49:21.171 --> 02:49:25.680
and the ne it no good.
Everything.
You don't keep your hands up.

2991
02:49:25.681 --> 02:49:28.650
You keep your hands low.
Okay.
What's going on here?
What do you say

2992
02:49:30.500 --> 02:49:33.900
to the no,
he like grabbed his balls.

2993
02:49:35.970 --> 02:49:39.240
Extreme sacrifice.
He might have not remembered it.
Right.
Honestly,

2994
02:49:39.300 --> 02:49:42.270
I kinda remember him doing it with his hands.
He does it with his feet.

2995
02:49:42.790 --> 02:49:47.100
It's with his feet.
This is Gary.
Good,
rich in pride.

2996
02:49:47.130 --> 02:49:50.230
That's in pride.
It's definitely not it.
It's not an ad either.

2997
02:49:50.231 --> 02:49:53.880
That's that's Pedro,
his own.
It's,
it's actually the Pedro.

2998
02:49:55.110 --> 02:49:59.940
Pedro.
Yeah.
You know it might be one of those ones where nobody has it.
Yeah.

2999
02:49:59.941 --> 02:50:02.730
Here we go.
Gary Goodrich.
Go down to the page or the fourth one down.

3000
02:50:03.180 --> 02:50:07.920
Click on that.
Let's see if this is it.
This is the Pedro,

3001
02:50:09.360 --> 02:50:13.050
but this is him.
But that's not Gary Goodrich fight and that's somebody else.
Oh,

3002
02:50:13.051 --> 02:50:15.210
this is a highlight reel of the Pedro.
And you know what?

3003
02:50:15.211 --> 02:50:17.910
He's not going to show that.
He might,
he might just say,

3004
02:50:17.911 --> 02:50:21.450
look at this and I want to know about that guy.
I want to know about the Pedro.

3005
02:50:21.630 --> 02:50:25.480
That guy was a,
he was like pioneer.
Yeah.

3006
02:50:27.070 --> 02:50:30.330
Looking at these old school nets,
these two,
but nets around the ring.

3007
02:50:32.040 --> 02:50:35.700
Well,
they used to fight and rings like people don't know that chocolate.

3008
02:50:35.701 --> 02:50:39.930
Dell fought a fucking Palae.
Palae,

3009
02:50:40.510 --> 02:50:42.480
Jose Landy,
Jose Palae,

3010
02:50:42.810 --> 02:50:47.810
Landy Johns who was at the time the baddest motherfucker from shoot box Palae

3011
02:50:48.361 --> 02:50:51.360
was up beast man when he was young,
he was devastating.

3012
02:50:51.361 --> 02:50:56.070
He was like the leader of the chute box crew and he was one of the best and um,

3013
02:50:56.160 --> 02:50:59.730
chocolate Dell fought him.
No rules with fucking bare knuckles.

3014
02:50:59.731 --> 02:51:01.020
That's a wild ass fight.

3015
02:51:01.140 --> 02:51:05.690
I'll you a UFC fanatics that are under 30 I mean you got to know your history.

3016
02:51:05.691 --> 02:51:08.270
We got to go back and study.
It's like,

3017
02:51:08.280 --> 02:51:11.640
to us it's like studying the 30s and forties we got to go back.

3018
02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.880
Look at the 60s you've got to look at that old school stuff.

3019
02:51:14.881 --> 02:51:17.250
So I have a masters did it.

3020
02:51:17.310 --> 02:51:20.370
I VC and what was the other one called?

3021
02:51:20.371 --> 02:51:24.140
Remember when Marco [inaudible] Penda he was the first time in a while.
Yeah,

3022
02:51:24.150 --> 02:51:26.670
that's right.
What was his,
his organization called?

3023
02:51:27.090 --> 02:51:30.260
It was either IVC or Mecca and they showed the jungle.

3024
02:51:30.450 --> 02:51:32.360
It was two dudes as far but equal law panda.

3025
02:51:32.370 --> 02:51:36.870
And then there was another guy that's got some series that was late nineties

3026
02:51:37.080 --> 02:51:39.090
Mna.
Bare knuckle.

3027
02:51:39.120 --> 02:51:43.410
How about when Marco who was fought all leg tack tar off in a hotel in Brazil.

3028
02:51:43.680 --> 02:51:47.790
They had like a chandelier above the ring if fought in a ring.

3029
02:51:47.820 --> 02:51:51.630
I don't remember that or not.
Yeah,
I had,
I had it on VHS.

3030
02:51:51.750 --> 02:51:56.310
It's the most ridiculous scenario.
They're like,
well yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

3031
02:51:56.850 --> 02:52:00.750
They fought bare knuckle.
It was like a slow methodical find.
Um,

3032
02:52:01.380 --> 02:52:02.480
find that uh,

3033
02:52:02.580 --> 02:52:06.970
Marco who asks are you a ass all leg tack tar off?

3034
02:52:07.330 --> 02:52:08.500
They fought in Brazil.

3035
02:52:08.530 --> 02:52:12.970
It's in a ring and they have this like ridiculous like chandelier above the k

3036
02:52:13.040 --> 02:52:15.960
above the ring.
You'll like looking at this chandelier.
What the fuck is that?

3037
02:52:15.961 --> 02:52:19.930
Where are you like a name Marco who was old leg tack tar off.

3038
02:52:20.440 --> 02:52:22.330
He was one of the original fighters in the UFC.

3039
02:52:22.331 --> 02:52:25.300
The first ever that I ever heard of sambo before.

3040
02:52:25.301 --> 02:52:28.780
I'd never even heard of it before.
Yeah.
This guy was throwing up these leg locks.

3041
02:52:29.050 --> 02:52:32.350
It's hilarious when you look at it like we thought all exact offers a leg lock

3042
02:52:32.351 --> 02:52:33.130
master.

3043
02:52:33.130 --> 02:52:37.090
You compare him to someone like Eddie Cummings and you look at like how the leg

3044
02:52:37.091 --> 02:52:42.091
lock game has changed in 20 years because is radically changed to the point.

3045
02:52:42.401 --> 02:52:46.480
Like people have figured out all these crazy new ways to control and enter and

3046
02:52:46.690 --> 02:52:51.140
we used to think that all ag tech tarp was the,
he was a tough pregnancy.

3047
02:52:51.160 --> 02:52:52.900
One Hanzo up kicked him and knocked him out.

3048
02:52:54.280 --> 02:52:58.570
That was world combat championships,
right?
The WCC or something like that.

3049
02:52:58.571 --> 02:53:02.710
That was the same one where Tom Erickson fought Marillo Bustamante for like 90

3050
02:53:02.711 --> 02:53:05.500
minutes.
Oh,
Shamba that.
Yeah.

3051
02:53:05.501 --> 02:53:09.680
Tom Erickson was like 300 pounds.
He was a beast to aid.

3052
02:53:09.870 --> 02:53:14.560
Two was shy and Tom Erickson was the first a male,

3053
02:53:14.650 --> 02:53:18.940
a male,
but heavyweight.
Unbeatable forth.

3054
02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:22.870
Tom Erickson came along.
He came along.
He uh,
he fairing did,

3055
02:53:22.871 --> 02:53:26.680
he'd having took his back in,
in pride.
He got tired.
Tom got Tired.
Yeah.

3056
02:53:26.681 --> 02:53:30.160
This is it.
Like,
look where they are.
They're in a fucking there.

3057
02:53:30.400 --> 02:53:32.750
Like some angles you get to see like,

3058
02:53:32.830 --> 02:53:37.630
I guess actually with that thing above their head.
This is crazy.
Like

3059
02:53:39.270 --> 02:53:42.970
it's hard.
You see it from this angle as far as fight.
This is crazy.
Oh,
he take,

3060
02:53:42.980 --> 02:53:46.630
Tom just landed some good shots.
Bare knuckle of how long?
It doesn't go far.

3061
02:53:46.980 --> 02:53:51.670
I was a long ass fight.
It looks like 30 minutes.
It says.
Um,
but they um,

3062
02:53:52.330 --> 02:53:53.950
they fought in like a conference hall,
man.

3063
02:53:53.951 --> 02:53:55.720
This is after they had both left the UFC.

3064
02:53:56.530 --> 02:53:59.560
It looks like a place where you'd have to look at that.
Look at the ceiling,

3065
02:53:59.590 --> 02:54:04.360
looking at fucking chandelier.
What is that?
That's nuts.
It's bizarre.

3066
02:54:04.560 --> 02:54:09.160
Oh,
throwing down a look.
Just tagged him and be like,

3067
02:54:09.161 --> 02:54:12.970
we thought like Marco.
Who else at the time?
It was like a world class striker.

3068
02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:16.930
You know,
it's interesting.
He was really good for MMA.

3069
02:54:16.960 --> 02:54:18.880
He was really good at a bunch of different things.

3070
02:54:19.120 --> 02:54:20.940
But if you compared him back then took,

3071
02:54:20.941 --> 02:54:24.250
I like Andy Hook who was fighting k one at the same time.

3072
02:54:24.251 --> 02:54:28.720
Who was a real world class striker or a guy like Jerome Le Banner or,

3073
02:54:29.170 --> 02:54:33.550
or you know,
Peter Arts is a big fucking difference.
Marco,

3074
02:54:33.551 --> 02:54:36.820
who was first got his leg kicks successfully in the UFC hall.

3075
02:54:36.821 --> 02:54:41.710
Varlands chopped down the fucking fire.
Another one.
You youngsters,

3076
02:54:42.160 --> 02:54:44.020
Paul Varland and Marco who asked me,

3077
02:54:44.050 --> 02:54:48.430
Paul violence was the first pigeon toed giant American male to fight in the UFC

3078
02:54:48.431 --> 02:54:52.990
two giant.
It's been a couple of those
style.

3079
02:54:53.680 --> 02:54:57.760
I don't remember what trap fighting.
Is that what they called it?
Oh my God.

3080
02:54:57.761 --> 02:54:59.020
He's a master of trap.

3081
02:54:59.050 --> 02:55:02.230
A lot of those guys had some great eve Edwards takes the cake though.

3082
02:55:02.260 --> 02:55:06.920
Thug Jitsu Thug Jujitsu master.
That's still his,
uh,

3083
02:55:07.130 --> 02:55:08.030
his Twitter handle,

3084
02:55:08.031 --> 02:55:12.140
which is funny now because he's an analyst for Fox and his Twitter handle is

3085
02:55:12.150 --> 02:55:16.460
thug Jitsu.
He might have to change his shit.

3086
02:55:16.700 --> 02:55:18.110
He's a really good analyst man.

3087
02:55:18.140 --> 02:55:21.860
He was on like a UFC inside or wherever the fuck it is.
What do they call it?

3088
02:55:22.070 --> 02:55:24.920
Yeah,
he was on after the fights,
analyzing the fights,

3089
02:55:24.921 --> 02:55:27.150
breaking down the fights this past weekend.
The detour.

3090
02:55:27.170 --> 02:55:29.840
And I didn't know he really wanted the roster.
Yeah.

3091
02:55:29.841 --> 02:55:34.280
Well he's doing an analyst's work now,
so he's not fighting.
No,
he's retired.

3092
02:55:34.281 --> 02:55:38.510
He's retired from fighting,
but his,
his analysis was really fucking good,
man.

3093
02:55:38.930 --> 02:55:43.880
He,
uh,
he,
the Anthony Burchuk Thomas made a fight.
He was excellent in that.

3094
02:55:43.940 --> 02:55:47.360
Excellent.
Yeah,
he's very good.
Commentated it,
no,

3095
02:55:47.600 --> 02:55:50.650
after the fight he broke down.
What,
what happened,
you know,

3096
02:55:50.690 --> 02:55:53.960
he broke down and they'll talk about like what guys have to do in order to win

3097
02:55:53.961 --> 02:55:57.290
the fight and what,
what their best strategies are.
He's very smooth man.

3098
02:55:57.320 --> 02:55:59.390
Very good.
Very mean.
You know,
Eve's fought,

3099
02:55:59.391 --> 02:56:02.330
like we said back in the hook and shoot days when he fought Erin Riley,

3100
02:56:02.331 --> 02:56:05.800
which just like the 90s,
he's been around for so long.
I mean he's,

3101
02:56:05.801 --> 02:56:10.700
he's got so much information in his head and even though he lost some of his

3102
02:56:10.701 --> 02:56:14.690
fights towards the end,
he hasn't,
he hasn't like suffered in the,

3103
02:56:14.691 --> 02:56:17.990
to the point where he's hard to hear,
communicate,
you know,
he's very smooth,

3104
02:56:18.020 --> 02:56:21.320
very good communicator.
So he's smart about when he got out he was like,

3105
02:56:21.321 --> 02:56:24.530
you know what,
I just stepped back now.
And so he's like,

3106
02:56:24.531 --> 02:56:27.770
still got all his faculties.
He is excellent as a,
as an analyst.

3107
02:56:28.340 --> 02:56:31.640
Those are the best analysts like Dominick Cruz.
He's one of my favorites too.

3108
02:56:31.940 --> 02:56:36.830
Super Smooth.
And you know,
and also Dominic is just really hard to hit man.

3109
02:56:36.831 --> 02:56:38.600
He's,
he's not a guy that gets hit a lot.

3110
02:56:38.960 --> 02:56:42.650
He's like a big part of what he does is like avoid damage.

3111
02:56:42.680 --> 02:56:44.000
He's very smart like that.

3112
02:56:44.270 --> 02:56:48.080
Like you very rarely see that guy in like a crazy slug fest,
you know?

3113
02:56:48.560 --> 02:56:49.580
So because of that,

3114
02:56:49.880 --> 02:56:54.440
I bet he'll have a long career in being an analyst after he's done fighting too.

3115
02:56:55.310 --> 02:56:58.880
It's amazing that there's so many football analyst after all the head trauma

3116
02:56:58.881 --> 02:57:01.690
they go through.
Yeah,
it's things they just pumped.

3117
02:57:01.691 --> 02:57:03.740
Those dudes fill with Adderall and steroids,

3118
02:57:04.590 --> 02:57:06.650
windup ass and just push him out there.

3119
02:57:08.010 --> 02:57:12.080
Is there something that you can take out there that's on the black market that

3120
02:57:12.081 --> 02:57:16.010
just makes your brain mushrooms for real?
For Real?

3121
02:57:16.011 --> 02:57:18.920
Mushrooms is supposedly silicide was one of the few things that's supposed to be

3122
02:57:18.921 --> 02:57:23.020
able to regenerate neurons.
Whether or not that's true.
I don't know her joking.

3123
02:57:23.060 --> 02:57:25.040
No,
I read that Amber Lyon,
stuff like that.

3124
02:57:25.040 --> 02:57:28.280
I read stuff like that and then I closed my laptop because I don't even want to

3125
02:57:28.281 --> 02:57:32.990
know the details.
A mage,
just going to just start repeating the,
you know,

3126
02:57:33.320 --> 02:57:34.070
I don't know if it's true.

3127
02:57:34.070 --> 02:57:37.130
The last time we talked to amber lions emailed her really recently.

3128
02:57:37.160 --> 02:57:41.300
She's gone on some wild trip all around the world and she's a little psychotic

3129
02:57:41.301 --> 02:57:44.400
drugs.
Oh,
she's doing everything,
man.
Everything.
What do you got?
What do you got?

3130
02:57:44.430 --> 02:57:45.080
She's doing it.

3131
02:57:45.080 --> 02:57:48.260
She's trying out shit and all these indigenous cultures traveling all over the

3132
02:57:48.261 --> 02:57:51.920
world,
writing about the time she was on your podcast.
Yeah,
she didn't,

3133
02:57:51.980 --> 02:57:56.060
she was all business.
It was all that reporting.
CNN Shit had nothing to do.

3134
02:57:56.330 --> 02:58:00.380
And during that podcast you started talking about mushrooms and you were going

3135
02:58:00.381 --> 02:58:01.980
off and you,
you,
uh,
broke

3136
02:58:01.980 --> 02:58:06.000
<v 3>it all down and she's sitting there and she was in a real bad spot and I like</v>

3137
02:58:06.001 --> 02:58:09.240
her life was falling apart at that point and she just decided,
fuck it,

3138
02:58:10.230 --> 02:58:12.210
I'm going to Peru or wherever she went.
And South America,

3139
02:58:12.220 --> 02:58:16.260
she was by herself one sock.
She didn't take shit.

3140
02:58:16.320 --> 02:58:17.400
She just went,

3141
02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:23.000
she comes back and she's like a crusader for silicide been crazy shit saying

3142
02:58:24.870 --> 02:58:27.860
sometimes you find the right people.
We got one minute,
Jesus Christ anymore.

3143
02:58:28.040 --> 02:58:32.790
It's over.
