<v Speaker 1>We're live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're live.</v>

5
00:00:04.351 --> 00:00:07.230
<v Speaker 1>You can't talk about tinder dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She can shot it off.</v>

6
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.240
<v Speaker 1>Don't swipe right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Hofstetter.</v>

7
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.750
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen already ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was at the same time.</v>

8
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited to be here.</v>

9
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited to have you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

10
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.080
<v Speaker 1>I'd love the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a video I found out about Steve</v>

11
00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:22.680
<v Speaker 1>because it's a video of some fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>hecklers.</v>

12
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.560
<v Speaker 1>Why do they still exist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people out there.</v>

13
00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:27.810
<v Speaker 1>Do you not know that when you come to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy show,</v>

14
00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:31.320
<v Speaker 1>it's like going to the movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't try to contact ego and</v>

15
00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:32.160
<v Speaker 1>alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

16
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.930
<v Speaker 1>That's the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked.</v>

17
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Asked a rhetorical question</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I got a definitive answer.</v>

18
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking great video though</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you handled it so well.</v>

19
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember the subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was.</v>

20
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.320
<v Speaker 1>What was she a heckling about?</v>

21
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.600
<v Speaker 1>It was about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about how parents think</v>

22
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:50.240
<v Speaker 1>they're special and they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right,</v>

23
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.510
<v Speaker 1>and then she yelled out bullshit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then walked into two minutes of material</v>

24
00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:56.160
<v Speaker 1>that I already had written about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>subject.</v>

25
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.830
<v Speaker 1>If I had written what she was supposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>

26
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.780
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't have been as good as what</v>
<v Speaker 1>she actually said.</v>

27
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a setup and sometimes those</v>

28
00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:06.240
<v Speaker 1>things happen and people accused people</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing plants.</v>

29
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.000
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard of anybody actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing a plant though.</v>

30
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:11.160
<v Speaker 1>You other than Andy Kaufman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

31
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.470
<v Speaker 1>like not even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not one time,</v>

32
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.500
<v Speaker 1>but people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some Times people look at the world and</v>

33
00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:17.011
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

34
00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:18.390
<v Speaker 1>this is too good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't be real.</v>

35
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.110
<v Speaker 1>Sleep will allow for some magic that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens sometimes.</v>

36
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.450
<v Speaker 1>A little comedy magic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

37
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's so many videos of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hecklers.</v>

38
00:01:26.671 --> 00:01:29.250
<v Speaker 1>You would think that they would learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's.</v>

39
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Is there a video of a heckler winning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

40
00:01:32.431 --> 00:01:34.020
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are definitely videos of people</v>

41
00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:35.640
<v Speaker 1>who are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I own this heckler.</v>

42
00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:37.260
<v Speaker 1>And then like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you,</v>

43
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.120
<v Speaker 1>did you looks Kinda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

44
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.150
<v Speaker 1>not really sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the heckler winning.</v>

45
00:01:42.151 --> 00:01:43.690
<v Speaker 1>That's the comedian losing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

46
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.940
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a difference.</v>

47
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end there are,</v>

48
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are times I think when they're</v>

49
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.540
<v Speaker 1>comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know this,</v>

50
00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:55.590
<v Speaker 1>they're comedians who can't ad Lib,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are brilliant at material but are</v>

51
00:01:55.591 --> 00:01:57.450
<v Speaker 1>just not add libbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's weird,</v>

52
00:01:57.451 --> 00:01:59.700
<v Speaker 1>isn't it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the people that only want to do</v>

53
00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:02.370
<v Speaker 1>like monologues and if anything goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>offline,</v>

54
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.930
<v Speaker 1>like they ignore it and they just keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>going and they hope that someone takes</v>

55
00:02:06.931 --> 00:02:08.130
<v Speaker 1>care of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

56
00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:09.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that like that.</v>

57
00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:11.760
<v Speaker 1>That's part of people sometimes will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

58
00:02:11.761 --> 00:02:12.960
<v Speaker 1>why do you have so many heckler videos?</v>

59
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because most of them start with me</v>

60
00:02:14.791 --> 00:02:15.624
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what'd you say?</v>

61
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't,</v>

62
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't let it go because I don't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to lose control of the crowd.</v>

63
00:02:20.131 --> 00:02:22.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't want other people to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well he talked,</v>

64
00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:24.750
<v Speaker 1>I can talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also I,</v>

65
00:02:24.751 --> 00:02:25.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

66
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.690
<v Speaker 1>I can't concentrate on this bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done a thousand times.</v>

67
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.730
<v Speaker 1>If in the back of my head I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

68
00:02:32.731 --> 00:02:34.230
<v Speaker 1>what's happening right now in the back</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the room?</v>

69
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well sometimes people just start</v>

70
00:02:36.511 --> 00:02:39.960
<v Speaker 1>commenting like they'll like be right in</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of you too.</v>

71
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.180
<v Speaker 1>Just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in the front row go,</v>

72
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.173
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not true.</v>

73
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.880
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't say that.</v>

74
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.850
<v Speaker 1>Don't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they even go.</v>

75
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

76
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.540
<v Speaker 1>Like when they agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it still sucks,</v>

77
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.300
<v Speaker 1>but what about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

78
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.750
<v Speaker 1>Then they want to put their own spin on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

79
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.480
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a seizing sometimes,</v>

80
00:02:57.481 --> 00:02:59.320
<v Speaker 1>like I try to tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

81
00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:00.760
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedies evocative.</v>

82
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.600
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have a lot of thoughts</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's okay.</v>

83
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 1>Have the thoughts hold onto those</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts later after the show released</v>

84
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:11.080
<v Speaker 1>thoughts in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for now it's okay to think of stuff</v>

85
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.190
<v Speaker 1>and even if you see me out in the lobby</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you want to have you got a question</v>

86
00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 1>about some of the material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk.</v>

87
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a time to talk.</v>

88
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.200
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not why you're halfway into the setup.</v>

89
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

90
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:25.630
<v Speaker 1>It's such.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

91
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:30.430
<v Speaker 1>part of why I say it's ego is because if</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's hundreds of people at this show</v>

92
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.510
<v Speaker 1>and they're all quiet and then one</v>
<v Speaker 1>person thinks they're all doing it</v>

93
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:35.590
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

94
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.270
<v Speaker 1>Like they're just sitting there and be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

95
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:37.691
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

96
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:38.980
<v Speaker 1>all these people are wrong there.</v>

97
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.140
<v Speaker 1>We should be interacting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to show them.</v>

98
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.150
<v Speaker 1>It is kind of funny that alcohol's would</v>
<v Speaker 1>they serve at comedy clubs because for I</v>

99
00:03:46.151 --> 00:03:49.090
<v Speaker 1>guess for most people it's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For most people.</v>

100
00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:52.390
<v Speaker 1>Alcohol is a social lubricant relaxes</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

101
00:03:52.391 --> 00:03:56.500
<v Speaker 1>You start laughing a little bit more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for some people the fucking,</v>

102
00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.670
<v Speaker 1>the wheels come off and they just want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to chime in and yell out,</v>

103
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:01.930
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're an asshole,</v>

104
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.640
<v Speaker 1>alcohol just makes you more of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>asshole.</v>

105
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

106
00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:08.560
<v Speaker 1>So I think I've had this theory for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time that a lot of people will</v>

107
00:04:08.561 --> 00:04:10.300
<v Speaker 1>blame being drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

108
00:04:10.301 --> 00:04:11.810
<v Speaker 1>I was so wasted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

109
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.930
<v Speaker 1>but that's you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were still in there.</v>

110
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.610
<v Speaker 1>There isn't some magical like jekyll and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hyde thing that's going on.</v>

111
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.030
<v Speaker 1>You peed on someone's truck because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted a p on someone's truck.</v>

112
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.130
<v Speaker 1>Alcohol just gave you the excuse.</v>

113
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.890
<v Speaker 1>There are people that are alcoholics</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

114
00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:29.200
<v Speaker 1>We're a switch goes off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know anybody like that?</v>

115
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:30.403
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

116
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>

117
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.660
<v Speaker 1>but I can introduce you to a fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

118
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:36.970
<v Speaker 1>I have a feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know who some of the people you hang</v>

119
00:04:36.971 --> 00:04:39.520
<v Speaker 1>with A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I don't hang out at the store</v>

120
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.590
<v Speaker 1>and the store is the grand old opry for</v>
<v Speaker 1>hecklers.</v>

121
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it really is this.</v>

122
00:04:46.531 --> 00:04:49.330
<v Speaker 1>There's something about that place</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's no real dorman.</v>

123
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.560
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's comics working the gate or comics</v>

124
00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:55.750
<v Speaker 1>working the door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comics work in the cover booth.</v>

125
00:04:55.751 --> 00:04:58.690
<v Speaker 1>Comics working the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the only comics.</v>

126
00:04:58.691 --> 00:05:01.270
<v Speaker 1>Comics work in the back parking lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all Comedians,</v>

127
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:02.960
<v Speaker 1>so when you're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>

128
00:05:02.961 --> 00:05:06.040
<v Speaker 1>You're under the hands of people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>really don't want to be doing what</v>

129
00:05:06.041 --> 00:05:07.480
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't really pay attention,</v>

130
00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:10.420
<v Speaker 1>so you have to learn how to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 1>hecklers.</v>

131
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.280
<v Speaker 1>Plus it's a hangout so that places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's people packed in that place from</v>

132
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.050
<v Speaker 1>8:00 PM til 2:00 AM and everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging around drinking and so there's a</v>

133
00:05:20.051 --> 00:05:23.830
<v Speaker 1>lot of alcoholics and so you just get</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to those dudes that have shark</v>

134
00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:27.340
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their eyes glass over and they're gone.</v>

135
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:28.510
<v Speaker 1>You look in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

136
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.040
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bobby's not here anymore.</v>

137
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.250
<v Speaker 1>I didn't meet people like that until I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was 30.</v>

138
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.500
<v Speaker 1>When I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was 30 I started to meet like</v>

139
00:05:38.501 --> 00:05:42.130
<v Speaker 1>real alcoholics where they'd have one</v>
<v Speaker 1>drink and then they were gone.</v>

140
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.940
<v Speaker 1>They're just off to the races.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do you think so do you think that</v>

141
00:05:45.941 --> 00:05:49.060
<v Speaker 1>they are a completely different person</v>
<v Speaker 1>or do you think that the alcohol just</v>

142
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.170
<v Speaker 1>allows who they are to come out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Completely speculative because I don't</v>

143
00:05:53.171 --> 00:05:56.190
<v Speaker 1>have that gene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever that wacky gene is where you</v>

144
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.940
<v Speaker 1>have a couple of drinks and you just go</v>
<v Speaker 1>off the rails.</v>

145
00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a happy drunk.</v>

146
00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.090
<v Speaker 1>Like when I get drunk I like to laugh</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hug people.</v>

147
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand the goal blank.</v>

148
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Make a multicav cocktail throat at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cops wake up in jail.</v>

149
00:06:11.181 --> 00:06:12.620
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

150
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.770
<v Speaker 1>Who did what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The weirdest drunk to me is the is the</v>

151
00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:17.660
<v Speaker 1>crying drunk drunk.</v>

152
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.160
<v Speaker 1>That gets super upset because then it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

153
00:06:19.161 --> 00:06:21.050
<v Speaker 1>why would you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you give yourself the</v>

154
00:06:21.051 --> 00:06:23.420
<v Speaker 1>ingredient that you need to cry in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>corner?</v>

155
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.420
<v Speaker 1>Like if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's the first time it ever happened,</v>

156
00:06:26.421 --> 00:06:27.410
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

157
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.200
<v Speaker 1>But if you're someone like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who every time he gets</v>

158
00:06:30.201 --> 00:06:32.390
<v Speaker 1>drunk he gets like super sad and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

159
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:34.430
<v Speaker 1>stop drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

160
00:06:34.431 --> 00:06:36.140
<v Speaker 1>why are you drinking if you're this</v>
<v Speaker 1>upset?</v>

161
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.950
<v Speaker 1>I feel like with people like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's patterns that are deeply carved</v>

162
00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:43.970
<v Speaker 1>into their psyche from childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe their mom cried.</v>

163
00:06:43.971 --> 00:06:47.450
<v Speaker 1>A lot of their dad cried a lot and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>got used to it and became a comforting</v>

164
00:06:47.451 --> 00:06:49.850
<v Speaker 1>pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

165
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.710
<v Speaker 1>those things are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean people say,</v>

166
00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what are you gonna do man?</v>

167
00:06:52.741 --> 00:06:53.574
<v Speaker 1>And the guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

168
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.560
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck did he get sad lives in</v>
<v Speaker 1>America?</v>

169
00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.880
<v Speaker 1>He's got two feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have cancer.</v>

170
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.240
<v Speaker 1>The fuck is he whining about there can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be 100 things wrong.</v>

171
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.480
<v Speaker 1>You're a young white person in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We shut up.</v>

172
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.320
<v Speaker 1>I actually don't drink anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been sober 12 years.</v>

173
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.540
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was because it was really my</v>

174
00:07:11.541 --> 00:07:13.580
<v Speaker 1>first year on the road when I realized</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

175
00:07:13.581 --> 00:07:15.680
<v Speaker 1>how much of a problem it could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

176
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.080
<v Speaker 1>so you get it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you did it as a preventative measure.</v>

177
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.681
<v Speaker 1>I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

178
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:21.710
<v Speaker 1>It was something where I didn't go</v>
<v Speaker 1>through a program and I found by the way</v>

179
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.260
<v Speaker 1>that like people who have gone through</v>
<v Speaker 1>the program or like,</v>

180
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

181
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really sober and to me I'm just like,</v>

182
00:07:28.761 --> 00:07:30.500
<v Speaker 1>you needed a program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have no willpower,</v>

183
00:07:30.501 --> 00:07:33.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a bit of a dichotomy there idea</v>

184
00:07:33.051 --> 00:07:37.880
<v Speaker 1>that someone could tell you after 12</v>
<v Speaker 1>years of sobriety that you're not</v>

185
00:07:37.881 --> 00:07:38.330
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

186
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.160
<v Speaker 1>This isn't even consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

187
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.710
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just choose not to drink and like,</v>

188
00:07:42.711 --> 00:07:44.180
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do choose not to drink,</v>

189
00:07:44.181 --> 00:07:45.150
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

190
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.540
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had a drink at 12 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>

191
00:07:47.541 --> 00:07:48.650
<v Speaker 1>it was one of these things where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

192
00:07:48.651 --> 00:07:50.240
<v Speaker 1>you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's free on the road,</v>

193
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody wants.</v>

194
00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Everybody goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

195
00:07:52.971 --> 00:07:54.980
<v Speaker 1>let me take a shot with you afterward</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be like,</v>

196
00:07:54.981 --> 00:07:56.480
<v Speaker 1>there are 30 of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to die.</v>

197
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just do the math on that and you're</v>

198
00:07:58.101 --> 00:07:58.611
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to die.</v>

199
00:07:58.611 --> 00:07:59.870
<v Speaker 1>And I started realizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

200
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't have inhibition that alcohol</v>
<v Speaker 1>changes.</v>

201
00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:07.460
<v Speaker 1>Like that same year I had done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd done some show in Bloomington,</v>

202
00:08:07.461 --> 00:08:10.400
<v Speaker 1>Indiana and we went to a bar afterwards</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were a bunch of hot girls</v>

203
00:08:10.401 --> 00:08:12.920
<v Speaker 1>dancing on the bar and I went up in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dance on the bar with them and I wasn't</v>

204
00:08:12.921 --> 00:08:13.550
<v Speaker 1>drunk.</v>

205
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.760
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to dance with the hot</v>
<v Speaker 1>girls and there were all these like</v>

206
00:08:16.761 --> 00:08:20.750
<v Speaker 1>there all these drunk people you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>below the bar,</v>

207
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:24.240
<v Speaker 1>like all these loser guys just kinda</v>
<v Speaker 1>like nursing their beer and looking up</v>

208
00:08:24.241 --> 00:08:25.760
<v Speaker 1>and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could do that and be like,</v>

209
00:08:25.761 --> 00:08:27.560
<v Speaker 1>well then get the fuck up on the bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

210
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:28.820
<v Speaker 1>If you want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

211
00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.630
<v Speaker 1>Can anybody just dance on the bar?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that makes me reconsider all the</v>

212
00:08:32.631 --> 00:08:36.230
<v Speaker 1>Times I've touched the bar and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>touched food and then.</v>

213
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my phone up there and touch that and</v>

214
00:08:39.221 --> 00:08:41.980
<v Speaker 1>then touched food in the bottom of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoes are not clean Joe.</v>

215
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.790
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's shoes are clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How will you just allowed to.</v>

216
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.790
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of violate health codes,</v>

217
00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>

218
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.860
<v Speaker 1>I just figure there were enough hot</v>
<v Speaker 1>girls that it was okay that I was there</v>

219
00:08:51.861 --> 00:08:53.360
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good call.</v>

220
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 1>Like the ratio has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There have to be still be enough hot</v>

221
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:56.791
<v Speaker 2>girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

222
00:08:56.791 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 2>did you hook up with one of those girls</v>
<v Speaker 2>afterwards?</v>

223
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a pathetic,</v>

224
00:09:00.271 --> 00:09:02.710
<v Speaker 2>sad loser,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the point is that that I,</v>

225
00:09:02.711 --> 00:09:06.060
<v Speaker 2>I didn't need the alcohol to at least</v>
<v Speaker 2>start the process of getting rejected.</v>

226
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.630
<v Speaker 2>That's you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have,</v>

227
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.790
<v Speaker 2>you have the unique personality trait</v>
<v Speaker 2>that allows you to get crazy dance on</v>

228
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:12.730
<v Speaker 2>bars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

229
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.570
<v Speaker 2>That is a strange thing though about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are in those 12 step</v>

230
00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:18.840
<v Speaker 2>programs because they really do get</v>
<v Speaker 2>super attached to the idea that that's</v>

231
00:09:18.841 --> 00:09:20.430
<v Speaker 2>the only way to be sober.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

232
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:22.980
<v Speaker 2>And it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a way and if you need that.</v>

233
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:23.640
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

234
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.860
<v Speaker 2>More power to you and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

235
00:09:25.861 --> 00:09:26.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do not,</v>

236
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to take that away from</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody,</v>

237
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.670
<v Speaker 2>but we're all different and everybody's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

238
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.610
<v Speaker 2>nerve endings connect differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever the hell that biology is of it.</v>

239
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.750
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't need to program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially because I would freak out if</v>

240
00:09:39.751 --> 00:09:41.610
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is about Jesus and it will be</v>

241
00:09:41.611 --> 00:09:42.450
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go fuck yourself,</v>

242
00:09:42.451 --> 00:09:45.150
<v Speaker 2>give me a beer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

243
00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:45.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't,</v>

244
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.250
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be able to be comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

245
00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:51.600
<v Speaker 2>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you ever do a program thing?</v>

246
00:09:51.601 --> 00:09:55.050
<v Speaker 2>Did you go to an alcoholics anonymous</v>
<v Speaker 2>meeting or just stop now?</v>

247
00:09:55.051 --> 00:09:58.440
<v Speaker 2>I had a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had,</v>

248
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.030
<v Speaker 2>there were a couple of times where I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

249
00:10:00.031 --> 00:10:00.780
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to,</v>

250
00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.090
<v Speaker 2>I need to quit and quit and that never</v>
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>

251
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.740
<v Speaker 2>And then there was one night where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

252
00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.750
<v Speaker 2>it's the first real time on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was terrible with women in high school</v>

253
00:10:09.751 --> 00:10:13.800
<v Speaker 2>and college and then suddenly I hit the</v>
<v Speaker 2>road as a comic and they're everywhere</v>

254
00:10:13.801 --> 00:10:15.900
<v Speaker 2>and they're interested and life is</v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

255
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.760
<v Speaker 2>And so there was a show.</v>

256
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.720
<v Speaker 2>I was doing the show first already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And usually the sororities that sponsor</v>

257
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:25.590
<v Speaker 2>comedy shows or like the philanthropy</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorority and they're all terrible.</v>

258
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:26.820
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

259
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.690
<v Speaker 2>these girls were all hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

260
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.200
<v Speaker 2>just dimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole chapter just full.</v>

261
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.780
<v Speaker 2>They had like one ugly friend is as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>charity,</v>

262
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.970
<v Speaker 2>but they just gorgeous girls and my</v>
<v Speaker 2>opener goes up and bombs and then I go</v>

263
00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:43.470
<v Speaker 2>up to a standing room only crowd and</v>
<v Speaker 2>crush and so now it's afterward we're</v>

264
00:10:43.471 --> 00:10:45.840
<v Speaker 2>hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like this after party thing that</v>

265
00:10:45.841 --> 00:10:48.540
<v Speaker 2>they put together for just them and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>two of us,</v>

266
00:10:48.541 --> 00:10:52.200
<v Speaker 2>one of which they hated because he</v>
<v Speaker 2>bombed and the like,</v>

267
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:53.910
<v Speaker 2>they're just these eight hot girls</v>
<v Speaker 2>surrounding me.</v>

268
00:10:53.911 --> 00:10:55.950
<v Speaker 2>One shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another one out of the way to sit next</v>

269
00:10:55.951 --> 00:10:56.491
<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

270

<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like nothing I've ever</v>

271
00:10:58.981 --> 00:11:02.190
<v Speaker 2>experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they took us to another party</v>

272
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:05.310
<v Speaker 2>and I'm pretty sure some will put</v>
<v Speaker 2>something in my drink.</v>

273
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.190
<v Speaker 2>Not In the way of like I want to fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy in the way of like,</v>

274
00:11:08.191 --> 00:11:10.770
<v Speaker 2>this is a guy getting all the attention</v>
<v Speaker 2>away from the other guys.</v>

275
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.200
<v Speaker 2>And I think one of the other guys fucked</v>
<v Speaker 2>with my drink.</v>

276
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.500
<v Speaker 2>Real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

277
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.160
<v Speaker 2>Because I got super violently ill very</v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly,</v>

278
00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.660
<v Speaker 2>like very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very quickly.</v>

279
00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:22.950
<v Speaker 2>And I spent the whole night I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to stay at the sorority house.</v>

280
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.560
<v Speaker 2>Like the plan was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to stay in the guest room so</v>

281
00:11:25.561 --> 00:11:27.180
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even have to do the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse of like,</v>

282
00:11:27.181 --> 00:11:28.530

283
00:11:28.531 --> 00:11:29.880
<v Speaker 2>Can I come in for like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

284
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:33.690
<v Speaker 2>I was supposed to go back there with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them and I spent the entire night just,</v>

285
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.850
<v Speaker 2>just vomiting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was terrible.</v>

286
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.740
<v Speaker 2>Spiked your drink and then I lost a Gig</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next day and at the time.</v>

287
00:11:40.741 --> 00:11:43.920
<v Speaker 2>So my first year on the road I lost a</v>
<v Speaker 2>$1,500 gig the next day.</v>

288
00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.930
<v Speaker 2>Because you were so sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't do it.</v>

289
00:11:45.931 --> 00:11:47.550
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were driving,</v>

290
00:11:47.551 --> 00:11:50.280
<v Speaker 2>it was the middle of winter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was wearing two pairs of pants,</v>

291
00:11:50.281 --> 00:11:53.290
<v Speaker 2>like two sweatshirts and in a sleeping</v>
<v Speaker 2>bag in the car with the heat on full and</v>

292
00:11:53.291 --> 00:11:57.420
<v Speaker 2>I was shivering the whole way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was fucked up so don't sure you</v>

293
00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.950
<v Speaker 2>didn't have the flu or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like the flu.</v>

294
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:03.850
<v Speaker 2>It went away like six hours later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it could've been,</v>

295
00:12:03.851 --> 00:12:07.360
<v Speaker 2>it could've been a very temporary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Flew a well timed.</v>

296
00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:07.991
<v Speaker 2>Flew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

297
00:12:07.991 --> 00:12:09.730
<v Speaker 2>but that was the night where I was just</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

298
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.420
<v Speaker 2>I can't keep up</v>

299
00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:12.370
<v Speaker 3>doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever heard of a drug that does</v>

300
00:12:12.371 --> 00:12:14.520
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a drug that makes you have the</v>

301
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.393
<v Speaker 3>chills?</v>

302
00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:16.450
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>

303
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.810
<v Speaker 2>they're probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might just be like,</v>

304
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:21.350
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't sound like it.</v>

305
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.070
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like you got something</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

306
00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:24.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

307
00:12:24.091 --> 00:12:24.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

308
00:12:24.971 --> 00:12:26.250
<v Speaker 2>it was just very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very bad.</v>

309
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:30.900
<v Speaker 2>And so I realized that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was not only a chance at like a</v>

310
00:12:30.901 --> 00:12:32.500
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a chance that like a nine some.</v>

311
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:34.770
<v Speaker 2>So you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>

312
00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.890
<v Speaker 2>That was more drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

313
00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:37.890
<v Speaker 2>none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

314
00:12:37.891 --> 00:12:39.390
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a wake up call.</v>

315
00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:43.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The world hands you four aces and you</v>

316
00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:48.710
<v Speaker 3>just throw up on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a hand of cards</v>

317
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.270
<v Speaker 3>that you ever heard of the term dry</v>
<v Speaker 3>drunk.</v>

318
00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:56.680
<v Speaker 3>Now what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dry drunk is what people like to say.</v>

319
00:12:56.681 --> 00:13:01.681
<v Speaker 3>People who are alcoholics who aren't</v>
<v Speaker 3>drinking but aren't in the program,</v>

320
00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:06.580
<v Speaker 3>are there dry drunks?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you still have all the mental</v>

321
00:13:06.581 --> 00:13:10.570
<v Speaker 3>issues that are drunk has.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just waiting to go off.</v>

322
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:15.250
<v Speaker 3>You don't really have the stability that</v>
<v Speaker 3>a 12 step program provides.</v>

323
00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:16.480
<v Speaker 3>That sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sounds right.</v>

324
00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:20.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean for some people for sure,</v>

325
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:24.910
<v Speaker 3>but a 12 step program is weird because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't require belief in a higher</v>

326
00:13:24.911 --> 00:13:25.620
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>

327
00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:26.730
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>

328
00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:32.060
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of God stuff in there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I believe that there was something,</v>

329
00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.830
<v Speaker 2>but that something could be a life</v>
<v Speaker 2>force.</v>

330
00:13:34.831 --> 00:13:36.480
<v Speaker 2>It could be an energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what,</v>

331
00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.180
<v Speaker 2>but I believe it's very possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something.</v>

332
00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:39.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

333
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:42.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that there's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that there's a bearded</v>

334
00:13:42.691 --> 00:13:45.140
<v Speaker 2>man and wings and all that bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be Dope.</v>

335
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.120
<v Speaker 2>There was though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't that if you got up to heaven,</v>

336
00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:51.000
<v Speaker 2>he realized that it was all true and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be amazing.</v>

337
00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:53.520
<v Speaker 2>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just a marketing thing.</v>

338
00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:59.700
<v Speaker 2>I just listened to a radio lab the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>day about addiction and they said that</v>

339
00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:03.600
<v Speaker 2>95 or sorry I'm gonna start that over of</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 people.</v>

340
00:14:03.601 --> 00:14:07.950
<v Speaker 2>If they started at a aaa on January</v>
<v Speaker 2>first as of December 30,</v>

341
00:14:07.951 --> 00:14:11.340
<v Speaker 2>first of that year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only five would still be in the program.</v>

342
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:14.160
<v Speaker 2>Basically saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't work,</v>

343
00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:17.880
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of factors that could</v>
<v Speaker 2>be at that could mean that or why that</v>

344
00:14:17.881 --> 00:14:20.100
<v Speaker 2>could happen because some people could</v>
<v Speaker 2>start a different program,</v>

345
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:23.850
<v Speaker 2>they can go to the meeting next door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're saying like only five</v>

346
00:14:23.851 --> 00:14:27.450
<v Speaker 2>percent of people will stay in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>program three years through some certain</v>

347
00:14:27.451 --> 00:14:29.160
<v Speaker 2>statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a shit retention,</v>

348
00:14:29.161 --> 00:14:29.994
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

349
00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:33.810
<v Speaker 2>but that was a that that radiolab goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>into this,</v>

350
00:14:33.811 --> 00:14:37.110
<v Speaker 2>a pill that can cure addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

351
00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.140
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've had an Ibogaine forever.</v>

352
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:40.470
<v Speaker 3>I began as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

353
00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:45.520
<v Speaker 3>it's a drug that it's from the Boga</v>
<v Speaker 3>plant and it's supposed to be fantastic</v>

354
00:14:45.741 --> 00:14:48.620
<v Speaker 3>for people that have heroin addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alcohol addiction,</v>

355
00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:51.800
<v Speaker 3>even addictive personality disorders</v>
<v Speaker 3>problems,</v>

356
00:14:51.801 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 3>things</v>

357
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.010
<v Speaker 1>along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's supposedly this ruthlessly</v>

358
00:14:55.011 --> 00:15:00.011
<v Speaker 1>introspective psychedelic experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>that brutally breaks down your pathways.</v>

359
00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:06.560
<v Speaker 1>You're thinking pathways and shows you</v>
<v Speaker 1>why you keep going into this self</v>

360
00:15:06.561 --> 00:15:10.280
<v Speaker 1>sabotage mode and it's apparently</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably uncomfortable to go</v>

361
00:15:10.281 --> 00:15:12.410
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychologically,</v>

362
00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:14.210
<v Speaker 1>physically it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't feel good,</v>

363
00:15:14.211 --> 00:15:19.211
<v Speaker 1>but when it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rate of retention of the retention</v>

364
00:15:19.521 --> 00:15:22.550
<v Speaker 1>of sobriety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that rate of sobriety that people retain</v>

365
00:15:22.551 --> 00:15:25.400
<v Speaker 1>afterwards is staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like in the eighties,</v>

366
00:15:25.401 --> 00:15:27.170
<v Speaker 1>the high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>80 percent better than anything.</v>

367
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:30.800
<v Speaker 1>Ruthlessly introspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like a great name of a comedy</v>

368
00:15:30.801 --> 00:15:32.990
<v Speaker 1>album does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

369
00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:33.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

370
00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:36.160
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a treatment center on the one on</v>

371
00:15:36.161 --> 00:15:38.840
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that [inaudible] I passed by and it</v>

372
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.760
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looked like a college campus almost</v>

373
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:41.870
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is that?</v>

374
00:15:41.871 --> 00:15:44.270
<v Speaker 1>And I looked it up and there's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a treatment center,</v>

375
00:15:44.271 --> 00:15:48.530
<v Speaker 1>like an inpatient and you like cut out</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone in your life kind of thing.</v>

376
00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:50.510
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those like,</v>

377
00:15:50.511 --> 00:15:51.440
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those like,</v>

378
00:15:51.441 --> 00:15:52.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowed to talk to people for</v>

379
00:15:52.491 --> 00:15:54.320
<v Speaker 1>six months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I looked it up,</v>

380
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:59.210
<v Speaker 1>I found that on Google and there were</v>
<v Speaker 1>reviews and one of the reviews was if</v>

381
00:15:59.211 --> 00:16:01.910
<v Speaker 1>someone who is about to go into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>treatment center and he gave it one</v>

382
00:16:01.911 --> 00:16:04.700
<v Speaker 1>star,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he was reviewing his own life,</v>

383
00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:07.780
<v Speaker 1>like he was that mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He like reviewed.</v>

384
00:16:07.781 --> 00:16:10.250
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm about to take the journey.</v>

385
00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:12.350
<v Speaker 1>The first step of the journey of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sobriety.</v>

386
00:16:12.351 --> 00:16:15.800
<v Speaker 1>And it was one star and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you may have misunderstood how</v>

387
00:16:15.801 --> 00:16:17.030
<v Speaker 1>this rating system works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buddy.</v>

388
00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:18.710
<v Speaker 1>It might be a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

389
00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:21.140
<v Speaker 1>Give something one star if you haven't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even tried it.</v>

390
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:24.750
<v Speaker 1>I love when you ever just read yelp</v>
<v Speaker 1>reviews too.</v>

391
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.230
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love mad at myself.</v>

392
00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.180
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I love when you learn more about the</v>

393
00:16:29.181 --> 00:16:31.310
<v Speaker 1>person and the restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

394
00:16:31.311 --> 00:16:32.150
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

395
00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:34.920
<v Speaker 1>There was one I saw in New York where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

396
00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.090
<v Speaker 1>this girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like she opens the review like,</v>

397
00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.830
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm back dating again and I'm like,</v>

398
00:16:39.831 --> 00:16:41.980
<v Speaker 1>that's not telling me how the pasta is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

399
00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.240
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to know that.</v>

400
00:16:43.241 --> 00:16:47.240
<v Speaker 1>But she uses it or has her own blog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fascinating though because then</v>

401
00:16:47.241 --> 00:16:49.220
<v Speaker 1>you get to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should I listen to this moron?</v>

402
00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.170
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me see what they have to say about</v>

403
00:16:51.171 --> 00:16:54.470
<v Speaker 1>David.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it that men these days don't want</v>

404
00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:57.350
<v Speaker 1>to open up a car door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want open up a door for a lady.</v>

405
00:16:57.351 --> 00:17:01.460
<v Speaker 1>Get upset when you're expected to pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>and don't understand that you do want</v>

406
00:17:01.461 --> 00:17:02.400
<v Speaker 1>your own career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

407
00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.060
<v Speaker 1>and as it turns out that Niki was</v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastic.</v>

408
00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just annoying.</v>

409
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:08.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of those.</v>

410
00:17:08.451 --> 00:17:11.300
<v Speaker 1>I always go to someone's bad review.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always go to their page and see what</v>

411
00:17:11.301 --> 00:17:12.940
<v Speaker 1>they think about other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

412
00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:15.020
<v Speaker 1>Just so you can figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also tough,</v>

413
00:17:15.021 --> 00:17:17.090
<v Speaker 1>like using yelp sometimes in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>of nowhere.</v>

414
00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:19.280
<v Speaker 1>That's really tough because then you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

415
00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:22.250
<v Speaker 1>these motherfuckers don't know Sushi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what do they,</v>

416
00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:24.770
<v Speaker 1>what do they know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sushi in South Dakota.</v>

417
00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:25.663
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

418
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.310
<v Speaker 1>Fishman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

419
00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:34.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yelp is tricky because it's like youtube</v>

420
00:17:34.521 --> 00:17:37.970
<v Speaker 1>reviews and lots of other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're relying on random people you</v>

421
00:17:37.971 --> 00:17:40.280
<v Speaker 1>don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if I call you up and I go,</v>

422
00:17:40.281 --> 00:17:42.140
<v Speaker 1>Hey Steve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about this?</v>

423
00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:43.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know Steve's an intelligent guy.</v>

424
00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:47.780
<v Speaker 1>He's going to give me a really nuanced</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought out opinion of whatever we're</v>

425
00:17:47.781 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Speaker 1>discussing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't know a person,</v>

426
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:53.310
<v Speaker 3>you just reading their type,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their type could be.</v>

427
00:17:53.311 --> 00:17:54.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they write,</v>

428
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:58.110
<v Speaker 3>write things down there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the printed word could be just as valid</v>

429
00:17:58.111 --> 00:18:00.990
<v Speaker 3>as some fucking psychopaths printed word</v>
<v Speaker 3>mean you don't.</v>

430
00:18:00.991 --> 00:18:02.700
<v Speaker 3>You really don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>

431
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:04.620
<v Speaker 3>You got to go deep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deep,</v>

432
00:18:04.621 --> 00:18:08.670
<v Speaker 3>deep into their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their paragraphs and you get to really</v>

433
00:18:08.671 --> 00:18:12.630
<v Speaker 3>try to decipher like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how fucking nuts is this person?</v>

434
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:16.500
<v Speaker 3>I have a theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a theory that the way we make</v>

435
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:20.340
<v Speaker 3>online tolerable that way we make like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

436
00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.600
<v Speaker 3>online not be this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

437
00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:27.360
<v Speaker 3>just I guess Bastian for angry thought</v>
<v Speaker 3>is everyone's not name,</v>

438
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.430
<v Speaker 3>but everyone's job shouldn't be in</v>
<v Speaker 3>parenthesis,</v>

439
00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:34.440
<v Speaker 3>so we know what people do for a living.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would help in like how many stars</v>

440
00:18:34.441 --> 00:18:37.160
<v Speaker 3>your coworkers give.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You usually get your,</v>

441
00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.770
<v Speaker 3>you get yelled at before you're allowed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to yelp.</v>

442
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:42.480
<v Speaker 3>You know that guy with one star.</v>

443
00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:46.110
<v Speaker 3>I bet he gives out a half a star.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet it all the people who work with</v>

444
00:18:46.111 --> 00:18:47.940
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they give him a half a star and he puts</v>

445
00:18:47.941 --> 00:18:52.140
<v Speaker 3>one star in for the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the drug review place and get one star</v>

446
00:18:52.141 --> 00:18:54.150
<v Speaker 3>for his mom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For Dope Mom.</v>

447
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:59.270
<v Speaker 3>There was an app that came out that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a yelp for people and everyone got</v>

448
00:18:59.551 --> 00:19:01.140
<v Speaker 3>really upset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was he yelled for?</v>

449
00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:02.370
<v Speaker 3>Dating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

450

<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it wasn't just okay because it was</v>

451
00:19:05.011 --> 00:19:09.570
<v Speaker 3>people you've dated because I thought I</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought the idea because it was,</v>

452
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reviews of people and people getting</v>

453
00:19:11.971 --> 00:19:14.490
<v Speaker 3>upset and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only people who would get upset at</v>

454
00:19:14.491 --> 00:19:16.620
<v Speaker 3>that are the people who know they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to get two stars.</v>

455
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:18.690
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

462
00:19:30.751 --> 00:19:33.450
<v Speaker 3>way for that to work as you can only</v>
<v Speaker 3>review someone if you both agree to</v>

463
00:19:33.451 --> 00:19:36.030
<v Speaker 3>review each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was reading this thing about this guy</v>

464
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:40.220
<v Speaker 3>who's getting stalked online,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this other guy and uh,</v>

465
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:45.270
<v Speaker 3>they found the person and it was a 17</v>
<v Speaker 3>year old kid that was the son of one of</v>

466
00:19:45.271 --> 00:19:48.520
<v Speaker 3>his friends and had no real beef with</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

467
00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:51.630
<v Speaker 3>But it was just doing it for sport just</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the fun of it.</v>

468
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:54.690
<v Speaker 3>Because he knew he could fuck with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy and scare him and he did all this</v>

469
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:59.700
<v Speaker 3>Holocaust Jews stuff and all this</v>
<v Speaker 3>antisemitic stuff is really,</v>

470
00:19:59.701 --> 00:20:03.630
<v Speaker 3>really crazy stuff like sent ashes to</v>
<v Speaker 3>their house and left ashes at their</v>

471
00:20:03.631 --> 00:20:05.460
<v Speaker 3>front door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a,</v>

472
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.860
<v Speaker 3>just a total psychopath,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a kid,</v>

473
00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:12.920
<v Speaker 3>17 year old kid and it apparently had</v>
<v Speaker 3>haunted this guy for a long time and he</v>

474
00:20:12.991 --> 00:20:14.760
<v Speaker 3>was trying to figure out who it was.</v>

475
00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.920
<v Speaker 3>Then he hired someone that's pretty easy</v>
<v Speaker 3>to find people.</v>

476
00:20:16.921 --> 00:20:20.580
<v Speaker 3>Once you hire someone who's an expert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they found the kid like instantly and</v>

477
00:20:20.581 --> 00:20:24.900
<v Speaker 3>they realized it was this fucking high</v>
<v Speaker 3>school kid that was the son of one of</v>

478
00:20:24.901 --> 00:20:27.840
<v Speaker 3>his friends and they all had a sit down</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he.</v>

479
00:20:27.841 --> 00:20:31.380
<v Speaker 3>They printed up all the stuff that this</v>
<v Speaker 3>kid had written for like a fucking year</v>

480
00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:35.820
<v Speaker 3>and handed it to him and the kid started</v>
<v Speaker 3>crying and I don't know why I did it.</v>

481
00:20:35.821 --> 00:20:40.530
<v Speaker 3>And I got addicted to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't stop and like addicted to it.</v>

482
00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:43.290
<v Speaker 3>Well now you're playing a game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know,</v>

483
00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.110
<v Speaker 3>and if you're not there when the person</v>
<v Speaker 3>is reacting,</v>

484
00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:49.300
<v Speaker 3>especially when you're and your</v>
<v Speaker 3>emotions,</v>

485
00:20:49.301 --> 00:20:53.170
<v Speaker 3>maybe they're not so complex or they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>not so rather formed and not,</v>

486
00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:58.120
<v Speaker 3>they're not mature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe completely aware that every action</v>

487
00:20:58.121 --> 00:21:00.580
<v Speaker 3>has a reaction on the other end whether</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see it or not,</v>

488
00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:03.490
<v Speaker 2>there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

489
00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:05.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that movie though the button or whatever</v>

490
00:21:05.571 --> 00:21:09.140
<v Speaker 2>it was where like someone like press a</v>
<v Speaker 2>button and someone would die in the</v>

491
00:21:09.141 --> 00:21:10.820
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard about that.</v>

492
00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:12.380
<v Speaker 2>I never saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't either,</v>

493
00:21:12.381 --> 00:21:14.960
<v Speaker 2>but there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was an snl sketch about it</v>

494
00:21:14.961 --> 00:21:17.150
<v Speaker 2>where they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they explain the whole premise or like</v>

495
00:21:17.151 --> 00:21:20.540
<v Speaker 2>you press this button in somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone the world die and the guy just</v>

496
00:21:20.541 --> 00:21:24.320
<v Speaker 2>hits the button and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't let us finish.</v>

497
00:21:24.321 --> 00:21:28.140
<v Speaker 2>Like we would give you a million dollars</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he just hits it again because we're,</v>

498
00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.620
<v Speaker 2>we're that like inhuman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>impersonal.</v>

499
00:21:30.621 --> 00:21:34.550
<v Speaker 2>Like if you just tell me that someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere else in the world died,</v>

500
00:21:34.551 --> 00:21:36.590
<v Speaker 2>like that doesn't really affect you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

501
00:21:36.591 --> 00:21:38.540
<v Speaker 2>There's too many people anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

502
00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:39.840
<v Speaker 2>Hit the button.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's clear up the four.</v>

503
00:21:39.841 --> 00:21:40.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five.</v>

504
00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:41.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it just depends on who.</v>

505
00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:45.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you don't feel it,</v>

506
00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:46.210
<v Speaker 2>it feels like</v>

507
00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:47.470
<v Speaker 3>problem with drones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

508
00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:50.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they say that drone pilots,</v>

509
00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:52.470
<v Speaker 3>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

510
00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:53.920
<v Speaker 3>is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

511
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:59.310
<v Speaker 3>They say that a drone pilots suffer</v>
<v Speaker 3>through a lot of severe anxiety when</v>

512
00:22:00.671 --> 00:22:04.600
<v Speaker 3>they're done and like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's apparently incredibly</v>

513
00:22:04.601 --> 00:22:09.601
<v Speaker 3>psychologically stressful because you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing this weird thing where you sort of</v>

514
00:22:09.701 --> 00:22:12.550
<v Speaker 3>sending this robot and they're doing it</v>
<v Speaker 3>from Nevada.</v>

515
00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:15.520
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the robots are in Afghanistan or</v>

516
00:22:15.521 --> 00:22:20.521
<v Speaker 3>Pakistan or Yemen or wherever the hell</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are and they're launching missiles</v>

517
00:22:20.801 --> 00:22:25.801
<v Speaker 3>from the sky robots and it just feels so</v>
<v Speaker 3>detached and creepy to the people that</v>

518
00:22:26.051 --> 00:22:26.884
<v Speaker 3>are doing it.</v>

519
00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same,</v>

520
00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:32.320
<v Speaker 2>I guess the same psychology of like why</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're able to get into such credit card</v>

521
00:22:32.321 --> 00:22:33.820
<v Speaker 2>debt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you wouldn't do that with cash</v>

522
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:36.300
<v Speaker 2>because like you were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

523
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:40.870
<v Speaker 2>you see it as just some mythical thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then afterward you realize,</v>

524
00:22:40.871 --> 00:22:42.700
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is real life.</v>

525
00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:46.900
<v Speaker 2>You would you be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you be able to kill someone if you</v>

526
00:22:46.901 --> 00:22:49.580
<v Speaker 2>knew that they were like a bad guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

527
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:51.760
<v Speaker 2>And would you feel bad about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

528
00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:53.680
<v Speaker 2>that's what I think too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

529
00:22:53.681 --> 00:22:56.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if someone like Hitler character.</v>

530
00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:57.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that doesn't necessarily</v>

531
00:22:57.881 --> 00:23:00.940
<v Speaker 2>have to be quite that bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean you really went to the end of</v>

532
00:23:00.941 --> 00:23:04.480
<v Speaker 2>the scale immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how extreme it was.</v>

533
00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:05.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going for like,</v>

534
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the idea of like someone is going</v>

535
00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.910
<v Speaker 2>to kill someone that you care about and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you killed that person.</v>

536
00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:14.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there are all these.</v>

537
00:23:14.471 --> 00:23:16.930
<v Speaker 2>Like there's this trope in movies and tv</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

538
00:23:16.931 --> 00:23:18.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a cop shot,</v>

539
00:23:18.371 --> 00:23:20.290
<v Speaker 2>someone that they had to shoot in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>line of duty.</v>

540
00:23:20.291 --> 00:23:20.861
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

541
00:23:20.861 --> 00:23:22.490
<v Speaker 2>like just killing some kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

542
00:23:22.491 --> 00:23:24.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting a bad guy and then they have to</v>

543
00:23:24.041 --> 00:23:26.550
<v Speaker 2>go to therapy over it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like.</v>

544
00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:27.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

545
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:30.390
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever talked to soldiers about</v>

546
00:23:30.391 --> 00:23:31.560
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't.</v>

547
00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:36.060
<v Speaker 3>The real ptsd with soldiers is things</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't control.</v>

548
00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.090
<v Speaker 3>That's what really fucks with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like worried about being attacked,</v>

549
00:23:39.091 --> 00:23:42.030
<v Speaker 3>worried about being blown up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>worried about driving over an ied.</v>

550
00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:45.210
<v Speaker 3>The soldiers that are proactive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Rangers,</v>

551
00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:48.320
<v Speaker 3>Navy Seals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys go in and hunt people down.</v>

552
00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.080
<v Speaker 3>They don't have that much ptsd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>PTSD.</v>

553
00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:54.110
<v Speaker 3>There are different types of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

554
00:23:54.111 --> 00:23:56.840
<v Speaker 3>some of them have just been through</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy firefights and they wake up with</v>

555
00:23:56.841 --> 00:24:01.700
<v Speaker 3>horrible nightmares,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a shocking amount of them realize</v>

556
00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.400
<v Speaker 3>they're doing the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to do this,</v>

557
00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:06.620
<v Speaker 3>this needs to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're the man to do it.</v>

558
00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:08.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're trained for it.</v>

559
00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:10.910
<v Speaker 3>This is their job and they're all</v>
<v Speaker 3>together and they like a family.</v>

560
00:24:10.911 --> 00:24:13.940
<v Speaker 3>It's a feel more superhero ask.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

561
00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:17.480
<v Speaker 3>So when you see like a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cop and a movie that feels bad that he</v>

562
00:24:17.481 --> 00:24:18.410
<v Speaker 3>had a shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bad guy.</v>

563
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:21.140
<v Speaker 3>That's like the writer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the writer.</v>

564
00:24:21.141 --> 00:24:23.030
<v Speaker 3>If the writer was a cop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

565
00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:26.030
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe a cop that maybe shouldn't be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>cop.</v>

566
00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:28.250
<v Speaker 3>She was definitely some of those out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

567
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:30.030
<v Speaker 3>Or a writer who shouldn't be a writer</v>
<v Speaker 3>or.</v>

568
00:24:30.031 --> 00:24:31.070
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

569
00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.180
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

570
00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:36.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean those movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how many of these movies have like</v>

571
00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.900
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we're talking about the grooves</v>

572
00:24:38.901 --> 00:24:42.380
<v Speaker 3>that are carved in that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people have that get depressed very</v>

573
00:24:42.381 --> 00:24:47.381
<v Speaker 3>easily or behave really like really a</v>
<v Speaker 3>sad really easily.</v>

574
00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.720
<v Speaker 3>Like those deals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grooves,</v>

575
00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:53.780
<v Speaker 3>those psychic grooves that they think</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're supposed to behave like</v>

576
00:24:53.781 --> 00:24:56.000
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are carved into tropes and</v>

577
00:24:56.001 --> 00:24:59.460
<v Speaker 3>storylines and plots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's so many plots,</v>

578
00:24:59.461 --> 00:25:02.330
<v Speaker 3>there's so many movies you watch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you didn't even write this.</v>

579
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:05.270
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You knew what has already been written</v>

580
00:25:05.271 --> 00:25:08.570
<v Speaker 3>about these subjects and you just sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of repeated it with different words.</v>

581
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:10.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this isn't really a story you wrote</v>

582
00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:14.810
<v Speaker 3>because this story has happened the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking million times in movies.</v>

583
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:17.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it causes those stories existing</v>

584
00:25:17.601 --> 00:25:19.650
<v Speaker 2>then cause people to act like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

585
00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:20.450
<v Speaker 2>Like we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

586
00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:23.330
<v Speaker 2>One of the most fascinating interviews I</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever saw was,</v>

587
00:25:23.331 --> 00:25:25.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they interviewed the guy who was,</v>

588
00:25:25.191 --> 00:25:26.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the gangster movies in the forties</v>

589
00:25:26.991 --> 00:25:29.150
<v Speaker 2>that say ha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying like all that.</v>

590
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.850
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did you get the accent so perfect.</v>

591
00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:35.330
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made that accent up and then all the</v>

592
00:25:35.331 --> 00:25:37.910
<v Speaker 2>gangsters wanted to be like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>gangsters in the movies.</v>

593
00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:42.410
<v Speaker 2>And so then all the gangsters started</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking like that because of that,</v>

594
00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.720
<v Speaker 2>because of those movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>James Cagney.</v>

595
00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:45.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

596
00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:49.010
<v Speaker 2>Like that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just told the act like they just</v>

597
00:25:49.011 --> 00:25:51.020
<v Speaker 2>started doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Life Imitates Art,</v>

598
00:25:51.021 --> 00:25:51.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

599
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:53.810
<v Speaker 2>And then it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

600
00:25:53.811 --> 00:25:55.520
<v Speaker 2>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then people feel like,</v>

601
00:25:55.521 --> 00:25:57.500
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this is normal because that's what</v>

602
00:25:57.501 --> 00:25:58.790
<v Speaker 2>we're shown on television.</v>

603
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.650
<v Speaker 3>Well that was the argument against</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gangsta rap that the argument was that</v>

604
00:26:03.651 --> 00:26:06.010
<v Speaker 3>they were forcing kids by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

605
00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:09.680
<v Speaker 3>making this music really popular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're are forcing kids to accept this</v>

606
00:26:09.681 --> 00:26:14.240
<v Speaker 3>type of behavior as being normal and</v>
<v Speaker 3>even exemplary,</v>

607
00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:18.620
<v Speaker 3>like exemplary of a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're shooting people and you ever go</v>

608
00:26:18.621 --> 00:26:22.010
<v Speaker 3>back and listen to like the old Nwa.</v>

609
00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually grew up.</v>

610
00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:27.170
<v Speaker 2>So I grew up in Queens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York and I was big fan of old school</v>

611
00:26:27.171 --> 00:26:29.720
<v Speaker 2>hip hop now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like,</v>

612
00:26:29.721 --> 00:26:32.630
<v Speaker 2>I was never big into the Nwa stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I preferred,</v>

615
00:26:35.841 --> 00:26:38.510
<v Speaker 2>not how many bitches we've killed,</v>

616

<v Speaker 2>that's kind of the line in the sand.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's that same sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When all of a sudden all the adults were</v>

647
00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:05.850
<v Speaker 1>I know I knew about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I never watched it.</v>

648
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:11.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

650
00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:16.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm a dead now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was like play the beginning of it</v>

651
00:28:16.291 --> 00:28:19.110
<v Speaker 1>because the beginning of the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if he could find it because the</v>

652
00:28:19.111 --> 00:28:23.940
<v Speaker 1>beginning of it is so fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>preposterous when he explains how we're</v>

653
00:28:23.941 --> 00:28:25.170
<v Speaker 1>gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep it real.</v>

654
00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.120
<v Speaker 1>We're keeping it real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

655
00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.280
<v Speaker 1>there's no such thing as that.</v>

656
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:30.810
<v Speaker 1>Like when people say we're keeping it</v>
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>

657
00:28:30.811 --> 00:28:33.420
<v Speaker 1>that means they're just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have no other words that they can</v>

658
00:28:33.421 --> 00:28:34.560
<v Speaker 1>think of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's madness.</v>

659
00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:35.573
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

660
00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.240
<v Speaker 1>it's a dangerous way of talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at a,</v>

661
00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:40.900
<v Speaker 1>a I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a bunch of extra work when I</v>

662
00:28:40.901 --> 00:28:43.440
<v Speaker 1>started out and which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so much fun.</v>

663
00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:44.401
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

664
00:28:44.401 --> 00:28:47.700
<v Speaker 1>Extra work is the best because you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see just the worst in humanity right</v>

665
00:28:47.701 --> 00:28:52.701
<v Speaker 1>in front of you with the extras.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're absolute just batch it.</v>

666
00:28:52.741 --> 00:28:54.000
<v Speaker 1>And there was a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

667
00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:54.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extrusion.</v>

668
00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Between going back and forth from extra</v>
<v Speaker 1>work to open mics.</v>

669
00:28:57.411 --> 00:28:58.830
<v Speaker 1>And that was my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was my day.</v>

670
00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.930
<v Speaker 1>I would just go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just go,</v>

671
00:29:00.931 --> 00:29:03.730
<v Speaker 1>just watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just watch people desperately need</v>

672
00:29:03.731 --> 00:29:06.180
<v Speaker 1>attention and do nothing of quality to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it.</v>

673
00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:09.870
<v Speaker 1>So there was this one woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put out the craft services and this</v>

674
00:29:09.871 --> 00:29:13.350
<v Speaker 1>one woman goes up and she loads up like</v>
<v Speaker 1>two plates and then putting stuff in her</v>

675
00:29:13.351 --> 00:29:14.184
<v Speaker 1>purse also.</v>

676
00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:17.880
<v Speaker 1>And I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she catches me looking at her and she</v>

677
00:29:17.881 --> 00:29:19.650
<v Speaker 1>just goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just keeping it real.</v>

678
00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:20.933
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

679
00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:24.270
<v Speaker 1>if you want to know what's real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to refill this table later</v>

680
00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:29.040
<v Speaker 1>so you can just come get seconds if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have product one and food to take</v>

681
00:29:29.041 --> 00:29:30.360
<v Speaker 1>home though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well in the purse,</v>

682
00:29:30.361 --> 00:29:32.640
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But just the idea of it was just,</v>

683
00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:37.290
<v Speaker 1>it was like the start of like a 14 hour</v>
<v Speaker 1>day just keeping it real.</v>

684
00:29:37.291 --> 00:29:38.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not keeping it real.</v>

685
00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.420
<v Speaker 1>Just say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

686
00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:41.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm really poor and I'm right now</v>

687
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.390
<v Speaker 3>keeping it real with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

689
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.720

<v Speaker 3>it was something to stare at.</v>

690
00:29:46.721 --> 00:29:49.030
<v Speaker 3>It was very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a minor infraction.</v>

691
00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:53.290
<v Speaker 3>You think about the world or holsters</v>
<v Speaker 3>and open mic and the paid furniture</v>

692
00:29:53.291 --> 00:29:54.310
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the.</v>

693
00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:55.930
<v Speaker 3>Keeping it real things about the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 3>store.</v>

694
00:29:55.931 --> 00:30:00.100
<v Speaker 3>You're constantly around crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People Open Michart especially,</v>

695
00:30:00.101 --> 00:30:01.400
<v Speaker 3>they're always hanging around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

696
00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:04.300
<v Speaker 3>because it's Kinda like a hangout on top</v>
<v Speaker 3>of being a club.</v>

697
00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:08.860
<v Speaker 3>What's the craziest Shit you've seen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>

698
00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:12.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean open mics or madness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's [inaudible].</v>

699
00:30:12.381 --> 00:30:16.090
<v Speaker 3>Anybody can get onstage and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>times that's one of the things about</v>

700
00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:20.860
<v Speaker 3>standup is that a lot of people don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>see themselves that way.</v>

701
00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:22.440
<v Speaker 3>Other people see them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

702
00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.270
<v Speaker 3>and that gets exposed when you get</v>
<v Speaker 3>onstage because you realize,</v>

703
00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:26.860
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is how people see me.</v>

704
00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:31.330
<v Speaker 3>People see me as being an obnoxious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really annoying person that thinks</v>

705
00:30:31.331 --> 00:30:32.164
<v Speaker 3>they're funny.</v>

706
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:37.450
<v Speaker 3>I see myself as being this really funny</v>
<v Speaker 3>person and then they have to work that</v>

707
00:30:37.451 --> 00:30:41.950
<v Speaker 3>out over the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's almost like a self</v>

708
00:30:41.951 --> 00:30:46.951
<v Speaker 3>improvement course on communication</v>
<v Speaker 3>skills because you are brutally reminded</v>

709
00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:51.310
<v Speaker 3>of how poor your communication skills</v>
<v Speaker 3>are when you don't get the laughs and</v>

710
00:30:51.311 --> 00:30:51.790
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

711
00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:53.650
<v Speaker 3>what is wrong with my thoughts?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is my thought.</v>

712
00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:57.550
<v Speaker 3>How about my friends think it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what is it that's the only someone</v>

713
00:30:57.551 --> 00:30:59.050
<v Speaker 3>who knows what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

714
00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:01.450
<v Speaker 3>The crazy people are the ones that go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this card doesn't get me.</v>

715
00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:02.700
<v Speaker 3>It was cropped sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

716
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:04.330
<v Speaker 3>It's called bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

717
00:31:04.331 --> 00:31:06.880
<v Speaker 3>how many times have we heard that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like every crowd I've ever played</v>

718
00:31:06.881 --> 00:31:07.840
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all suck.</v>

719
00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:10.520
<v Speaker 3>None of them understand bro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the worst thing that can happen,</v>

720
00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:15.530
<v Speaker 3>one of those people is some one day</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll just catch that magic wave where</v>

721
00:31:16.091 --> 00:31:19.540
<v Speaker 3>you know there's this one crowd where</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost anyone can do well.</v>

722
00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:22.690
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's these weird crowds that are just</v>

723
00:31:22.691 --> 00:31:27.691
<v Speaker 3>so good and so hyped up at some with</v>
<v Speaker 3>really shitty skills can get up there</v>

724
00:31:28.091 --> 00:31:32.350
<v Speaker 3>and just make it happen and they chased</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ghosts of that performance forever.</v>

725
00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:34.060
<v Speaker 3>Here's a great story that I've told</v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

726
00:31:34.061 --> 00:31:38.410
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately for people have heard it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Joey Diaz was the early days of the</v>

727
00:31:38.411 --> 00:31:40.780
<v Speaker 3>compressor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was one woman who is insane.</v>

728
00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean completely insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just.</v>

729
00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:45.190
<v Speaker 3>There was nothing remotely funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anything she ever had to say,</v>

730
00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:48.130
<v Speaker 3>she was brutal and she would go up and</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time she would go up,</v>

731
00:31:48.131 --> 00:31:49.240
<v Speaker 3>everybody would have to get out of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>room.</v>

732
00:31:49.241 --> 00:31:50.460
<v Speaker 3>It was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

733
00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:52.240
<v Speaker 3>What is happening here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How is she,</v>

734
00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:56.470
<v Speaker 3>how does she even get spots?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was during the nineties when it was</v>

735
00:31:56.471 --> 00:32:01.471
<v Speaker 3>easier to get spots and so Joey Diaz</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes backstage behind the curtain and he</v>

736
00:32:02.831 --> 00:32:07.360
<v Speaker 3>goes backstage and takes his pants off</v>
<v Speaker 3>and every time she hits a punchline he</v>

737
00:32:07.361 --> 00:32:09.130
<v Speaker 3>opens up the curtain and chose the</v>
<v Speaker 3>crowd.</v>

738
00:32:09.131 --> 00:32:12.850
<v Speaker 3>His balls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's got no pants on,</v>

739
00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:18.090
<v Speaker 3>so every time she hits the punchlines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's doing this and she's killing.</v>

740
00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:21.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean killing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you see that confident look in her</v>

741
00:32:21.631 --> 00:32:25.640
<v Speaker 3>face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She has no idea what's in the stride or</v>

742
00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:29.910
<v Speaker 3>swagger and she hits those St punchlines</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all of a sudden Joe,</v>

743
00:32:29.911 --> 00:32:32.020
<v Speaker 3>he comes out with his balls and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's crying,</v>

744
00:32:32.021 --> 00:32:34.360
<v Speaker 3>laughing and she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she never knew.</v>

745
00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:35.890
<v Speaker 3>She never knew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had no idea.</v>

746
00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:38.560
<v Speaker 3>No one ever told her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

747
00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.060
<v Speaker 3>If they did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she would never believed</v>

748
00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:40.791
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bull Shit.</v>

749
00:32:40.791 --> 00:32:45.050
<v Speaker 2>I was Carolyn like she was just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell.</v>

750
00:32:45.051 --> 00:32:50.051
<v Speaker 2>I tell young comics that you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't exist in the world.</v>

751
00:32:50.361 --> 00:32:52.730
<v Speaker 2>How you see yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you exist in the world as the sum total</v>

752
00:32:52.731 --> 00:32:55.180
<v Speaker 2>of how everyone else sees you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

753
00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:58.160
<v Speaker 2>that's who you are and that's true on</v>
<v Speaker 2>stage.</v>

754
00:32:58.161 --> 00:33:00.740
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you exist on that stage as the sum total</v>

755
00:33:00.741 --> 00:33:02.160
<v Speaker 2>of how the crowd sees you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

756
00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:04.160
<v Speaker 2>Your actions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your what you wear,</v>

757
00:33:04.161 --> 00:33:05.630
<v Speaker 2>how you stand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you speak.</v>

758
00:33:05.631 --> 00:33:09.350
<v Speaker 2>Those can all determine that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your thoughts of how you want to be</v>

759
00:33:09.351 --> 00:33:12.170
<v Speaker 2>seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the difference of how you see yourself</v>

760
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:16.640
<v Speaker 2>and how everyone else sees you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that chasm is delusion and so the</v>

761
00:33:16.641 --> 00:33:19.430
<v Speaker 2>shorter that chasm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more self aware you're going to be,</v>

762
00:33:19.431 --> 00:33:21.890
<v Speaker 2>the funnier you can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bigger that chasm,</v>

763
00:33:21.891 --> 00:33:23.930
<v Speaker 2>the more likely you're going to flip a</v>
<v Speaker 2>table on a reality show.</v>

764
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:26.970
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the difference.</v>

765
00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:28.800
<v Speaker 3>Very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a very good,</v>

766
00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:31.530
<v Speaker 3>very good way of putting it and it goes</v>
<v Speaker 3>back to what we were talking about</v>

767
00:33:31.531 --> 00:33:34.620
<v Speaker 3>earlier that stand up in a lot of ways</v>
<v Speaker 3>is almost like a vehicle for</v>

768
00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:37.610
<v Speaker 3>introspective observation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're.</v>

769
00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:41.910
<v Speaker 3>You're almost forced to examine yourself</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a way that very few people do because</v>

770
00:33:41.911 --> 00:33:45.650
<v Speaker 3>people like to put a blinders and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>why people like to drink.</v>

771
00:33:45.651 --> 00:33:50.651
<v Speaker 3>You just got to push it all away and</v>
<v Speaker 3>ignore all the faults and press on and</v>

772
00:33:51.361 --> 00:33:53.130
<v Speaker 3>when you're doing standup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you really.</v>

773
00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:56.700
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that because bombing is so</v>
<v Speaker 3>unbelievably,</v>

774
00:33:56.701 --> 00:33:58.500
<v Speaker 3>brutally painful that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>

775
00:33:58.501 --> 00:34:00.210
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That can't happen again.</v>

776
00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:03.030
<v Speaker 2>If you know you bomb though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I try.</v>

777
00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.670
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was first living out here,</v>

778
00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:07.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would hang out at the,</v>

779
00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:09.270
<v Speaker 2>there were shows at Westwood Brewco all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

780
00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:11.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you ever did those Adam</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hunter shows?</v>

781
00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:12.170
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

782
00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:12.571
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

783
00:34:12.571 --> 00:34:14.660
<v Speaker 2>Adam prairie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they were a,</v>

784
00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:18.180
<v Speaker 2>so I would hang out there all the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there was one night where a bunch of</v>

785
00:34:18.181 --> 00:34:23.040
<v Speaker 2>comics had done a show in Long Beach on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Queen Mary and one by one they were</v>

786
00:34:23.041 --> 00:34:24.990
<v Speaker 2>all getting to Westwood and every one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

787
00:34:24.991 --> 00:34:26.160
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that show is terrible.</v>

788
00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:28.300
<v Speaker 2>The Queen Mary's a boat by the way for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

789
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:29.383
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

790
00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:33.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess if people are unfamiliar and be</v>

791
00:34:33.431 --> 00:34:35.760
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all performed on this one lady and</v>

792
00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.760
<v Speaker 2>she's a Queen Queen of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's on the,</v>

793
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:41.030
<v Speaker 2>it's not even like in a bar called the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Queen Mary.</v>

794
00:34:41.031 --> 00:34:42.900
<v Speaker 2>It's on the Queen Mary or what are they</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about?</v>

795
00:34:42.930 --> 00:34:44.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just standing on this lady named</v>

796
00:34:44.701 --> 00:34:47.280
<v Speaker 2>Mary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one by one they would all show up</v>

797
00:34:47.281 --> 00:34:49.110
<v Speaker 2>and they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were like 12 people there and it</v>

798
00:34:49.111 --> 00:34:52.290
<v Speaker 2>was a nightmare and everyone is talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about how shitty it was and how</v>

799
00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:54.120
<v Speaker 2>everybody bombed and the night was</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>

800
00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:57.600
<v Speaker 2>Then one comment gets there and doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know that everyone had already done</v>

801
00:34:57.601 --> 00:34:59.130
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the first thing he does,</v>

802
00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:00.690
<v Speaker 2>he had just got back from Long Beach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

803
00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:02.760
<v Speaker 2>I crushed that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was such a great show.</v>

804
00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:05.940
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was going nuts and just going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on and on about how great it was.</v>

805
00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.310
<v Speaker 2>And the rest of us are just being like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>This is the only one left there.</v>

872
00:37:38.071 --> 00:37:39.570
<v Speaker 1>Easily trick though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to be.</v>

873
00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:44.780
<v Speaker 1>I used to be a segment producer on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>show and we would always put in stuff we</v>

874
00:37:45.001 --> 00:37:47.940
<v Speaker 1>didn't want to use so that they could</v>
<v Speaker 1>come in the room and be like,</v>

875
00:37:47.941 --> 00:37:48.211
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

876
00:37:48.211 --> 00:37:48.420
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

877
00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:50.700
<v Speaker 1>You have to take that out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take that out and then leave in the</v>

878
00:37:50.701 --> 00:37:52.140
<v Speaker 1>thing that we thought they would take</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

879
00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:54.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've seen the scene in team</v>

880
00:37:54.091 --> 00:37:55.230
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>world police,</v>

881
00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:58.740
<v Speaker 1>they the sex scene between the two</v>
<v Speaker 1>puppets,</v>

882
00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:04.020
<v Speaker 1>they made like 10 minutes longer than</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanted it to be where he shits on</v>

883
00:38:04.021 --> 00:38:07.440
<v Speaker 1>her chest or she shits on his chest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They pee on each side on both.</v>

884
00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:10.270
<v Speaker 1>They went nuts and the reason why they</v>
<v Speaker 1>did it,</v>

885
00:38:10.271 --> 00:38:12.030
<v Speaker 1>it was because they could cut some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

886
00:38:12.031 --> 00:38:14.670
<v Speaker 1>It would still be preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which it wound up being.</v>

887
00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:15.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

888
00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:20.280
<v Speaker 1>that's a common strategy that we did</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in the nineties with news radio,</v>

889
00:38:20.281 --> 00:38:25.281
<v Speaker 1>we had an episode of news radio where</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phil Hartman said Penis on the air on</v>

890
00:38:25.441 --> 00:38:28.860
<v Speaker 1>the radio show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it was through the episode.</v>

891
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:32.350
<v Speaker 1>He said Penis like 20 times and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

892
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:34.530
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't say penis more than eight</v>

893
00:38:34.531 --> 00:38:36.170
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was like eight times.</v>

894
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:39.700
<v Speaker 3>Who makes that it's fucking assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Assholes,</v>

895
00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:43.620
<v Speaker 3>assholes who decide what America is</v>
<v Speaker 3>willing to tolerate.</v>

896
00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:47.230
<v Speaker 3>Crazy rebel bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was four times,</v>

897
00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:48.460
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

898
00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:52.290
<v Speaker 3>they didn't air it so it didn't air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems that at all.</v>

899
00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.580
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it had an air in like season two or</v>

900
00:38:54.581 --> 00:38:57.040
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like whatever season it was.</v>

901
00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:59.020
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it was season two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember what season it was,</v>

902
00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:02.800
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it had an air leg the next season or the</v>

903
00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:03.940
<v Speaker 3>season later.</v>

918
00:39:29.971 --> 00:39:32.820
<v Speaker 2>penguins because all the suits would</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's so hard</v>

923
00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:41.960
<v Speaker 3>retread.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's totally arbitrary and there's no</v>

924
00:39:41.961 --> 00:39:43.840
<v Speaker 3>rules anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happens on the nighttime,</v>

925
00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:47.320
<v Speaker 3>like beetle juice comes out or penis</v>
<v Speaker 3>choose comes seat.</v>

926
00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:50.250
<v Speaker 3>Satan comes through the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a way to,</v>

927
00:39:50.251 --> 00:39:51.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do art.</v>

928
00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:55.820
<v Speaker 3>And it's definitely not by having a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of people that have money invested</v>

929
00:39:55.821 --> 00:39:57.110
<v Speaker 3>in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at it going,</v>

930
00:39:57.111 --> 00:39:59.090
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can we maximize this?</v>

931
00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.570
<v Speaker 3>How can we make this as sellable as</v>
<v Speaker 3>possible?</v>

932
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:07.400
<v Speaker 3>That's just the opposite of the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>mentality that you need to make</v>

933
00:40:07.401 --> 00:40:09.770
<v Speaker 3>something good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if it just like you were talking</v>

934
00:40:09.771 --> 00:40:13.610
<v Speaker 3>about with comedy or people don't see</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>

935
00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.040
<v Speaker 3>if you don't see yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how other people see it's not going to</v>

936
00:40:16.041 --> 00:40:18.290
<v Speaker 3>work and it won't be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's kind of the same thing with</v>

937
00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:21.810
<v Speaker 3>art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you produce a television show or a</v>

938
00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:26.090
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is and people don't enjoy it</v>
<v Speaker 3>while it won't go anywhere,</v>

939
00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:29.000
<v Speaker 3>it'll fall off and then it's not good</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

940
00:40:29.001 --> 00:40:31.610
<v Speaker 3>But to have someone come in and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

941
00:40:31.611 --> 00:40:34.070
<v Speaker 3>you got to do this and you got to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that because we know better because</v>

942
00:40:34.071 --> 00:40:35.960
<v Speaker 3>we're the ones with the money that never</v>
<v Speaker 3>works.</v>

943
00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:39.560
<v Speaker 2>But every time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time I think that I remember that</v>

944
00:40:39.561 --> 00:40:40.720
<v Speaker 2>according to Jim had over</v>

945
00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:44.310
<v Speaker 3>100 episodes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>over a hundred episodes,</v>

946
00:40:44.311 --> 00:40:45.051
<v Speaker 3>but that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>

947
00:40:45.051 --> 00:40:47.910
<v Speaker 3>there's a style of comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had over a hundred episodes.</v>

948
00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:49.750
<v Speaker 3>I remember Jag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jag was online,</v>

949
00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:51.300
<v Speaker 3>I was on news radio and we were always</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

950
00:40:51.301 --> 00:40:55.320
<v Speaker 3>what in the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How is that a real show?</v>

951
00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:57.780
<v Speaker 3>If you've ever watched that show?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody watched that show.</v>

952
00:40:57.781 --> 00:41:00.360
<v Speaker 3>And the people that did watch that show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like they were sedated.</v>

953
00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:04.230
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's a hum and under which</v>
<v Speaker 3>like subliminal messages were played in</v>

954
00:41:04.231 --> 00:41:07.380
<v Speaker 3>the background about Bush being a great</v>
<v Speaker 3>president or something,</v>

955
00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:12.450
<v Speaker 3>like it didn't make any vulcans and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't make any sense that it stayed on</v>

956
00:41:12.451 --> 00:41:12.930
<v Speaker 3>the air.</v>

957
00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:17.430
<v Speaker 2>You watch any of the CSS or any of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>are the know the one I'm thinking of</v>

958
00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:19.630
<v Speaker 2>Ntis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

959
00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:24.240
<v Speaker 2>I saw an episode the other day I get</v>
<v Speaker 2>transfixed with bad television.</v>

960
00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.970
<v Speaker 2>Like I never put it on purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if like someone,</v>

961
00:41:26.971 --> 00:41:29.880
<v Speaker 2>if I'm like in a hotel room or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I flip it on or whatever it is,</v>

962
00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:32.730
<v Speaker 2>like it takes me a little to just shake</v>
<v Speaker 2>it off because I just want to be like,</v>

963
00:41:32.731 --> 00:41:34.400
<v Speaker 2>how is this mate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is this possible?</v>

964
00:41:34.401 --> 00:41:36.980
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I was watching it and I was</v>

965
00:41:36.981 --> 00:41:39.500
<v Speaker 2>thinking like the comedy in it was so</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>

966
00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:42.620
<v Speaker 2>Like the jokes were so terrible that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost wondered,</v>

967
00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:44.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they hire people for punch up.</v>

968
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:47.900
<v Speaker 2>Do they hire people for punch down?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like do they hire people to be like</v>

969
00:41:47.901 --> 00:41:49.130
<v Speaker 2>water down these good job?</v>

970
00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:51.770
<v Speaker 3>Well that's the chuck Lorre Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knows how to do them.</v>

971
00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:57.100
<v Speaker 3>He knows how to do that drone that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that one style of comedy,</v>

972
00:41:57.531 --> 00:41:59.200
<v Speaker 3>like two and a half men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

973
00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:01.460
<v Speaker 3>he did a bunch of the white noise</v>
<v Speaker 3>machine.</v>

974
00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:02.880
<v Speaker 3>He just does those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

975
00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:09.530
<v Speaker 3>know that for people that are all just</v>
<v Speaker 3>like exhausted from eating carbs and</v>

976
00:42:09.531 --> 00:42:12.740
<v Speaker 3>sugar all day and they just sitting in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the couch of some melting.</v>

977
00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:17.960
<v Speaker 3>Then the dumbest fucking humor plays out</v>
<v Speaker 3>in front of them and it's just enough to</v>

978
00:42:17.961 --> 00:42:20.480
<v Speaker 3>keep them paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they watched those Toyota</v>

979
00:42:20.481 --> 00:42:21.314
<v Speaker 3>commercials.</v>

980
00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:22.530
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

981
00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:26.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very often I wonder about like how does</v>

982
00:42:26.251 --> 00:42:27.450
<v Speaker 2>this get made?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is this,</v>

983
00:42:27.451 --> 00:42:29.060
<v Speaker 2>why does anybody like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

984
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:31.950
<v Speaker 2>And I was at some truck stop in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of nowhere,</v>

985
00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:37.120
<v Speaker 2>just getting gas and getting food and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a tier of the TV playing.</v>

986
00:42:37.121 --> 00:42:40.470
<v Speaker 2>It was like a little lunch counter and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a TV playing and as a commercial</v>

987
00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:44.580
<v Speaker 2>and there's this guy running around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's for blinds,</v>

988
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:47.980
<v Speaker 2>but this guy is running around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He like tries to open those blinds,</v>

989
00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:50.390
<v Speaker 2>Kinda has nothing to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he runs outside and you get</v>

990
00:42:50.391 --> 00:42:53.130
<v Speaker 2>stung by a bunch of stung by a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>bs and he's like fighting them off.</v>

991
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:55.050
<v Speaker 2>And I'm sitting there thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

992
00:42:55.051 --> 00:42:56.240
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck would do?</v>

993
00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:57.930
<v Speaker 2>I can write commercials like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who would do that?</v>

994
00:42:58.170 --> 00:43:00.780
<v Speaker 2>And there's a dude sitting next to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>just going,</v>

995
00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:03.510
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can't get away from the bees like</v>

996
00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:07.670
<v Speaker 3>just out loud to know what to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One just like he's all over it.</v>

997
00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:10.530
<v Speaker 3>They're all over the zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's for,</v>

998
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:15.110
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was at my friend's house once and her</v>

<v Speaker 3>and she just goes,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one one has 100 horsepower,</v>

1008
00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:51.590
<v Speaker 3>one has 500 horsepower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brains are like that too.</v>

1009
00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:52.670
<v Speaker 3>They just have to be.</v>

1010
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:56.120
<v Speaker 3>There's just no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a lot of those little prius</v>

1011

<v Speaker 3>brains,</v>

1013
00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:03.290
<v Speaker 3>you will attract them like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like metal to a magnet.</v>

00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:55.810
<v Speaker 1>It was your dad a multimillionaire and</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you grow up in Maine and pretend you</v>

1038
00:44:55.811 --> 00:44:57.210
<v Speaker 1>from Texas?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what about him?</v>

1039
00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:00.780
<v Speaker 1>What about the fact that your dad was</v>
<v Speaker 1>your dad in the CIA to where you see</v>

1040
00:45:00.781 --> 00:45:03.360
<v Speaker 1>that you see that with trump now where</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are like,</v>

1041
00:45:03.361 --> 00:45:04.920
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he reminds me of me and I'm just like,</v>

1042
00:45:04.921 --> 00:45:07.500
<v Speaker 1>he the furthest thing from you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the,</v>

1043
00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:10.710
<v Speaker 1>he's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in New York City and so like I</v>

1044
00:45:10.711 --> 00:45:15.300
<v Speaker 1>remember I was a kid when it happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I remember the central park jogger</v>

1045
00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:20.130
<v Speaker 1>when trump took out for full page ads in</v>
<v Speaker 1>different newspapers calling for the</v>

1046
00:45:20.131 --> 00:45:24.000
<v Speaker 1>death penalty for these black kids who</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't even do it and he was just</v>

1047
00:45:24.001 --> 00:45:25.080
<v Speaker 1>inciting a riot.</v>

1048
00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:27.360
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just trying to race bait and get</v>

1049
00:45:27.361 --> 00:45:30.480
<v Speaker 1>attention and that's the guy I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1050
00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:33.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't relate to that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1051
00:45:33.271 --> 00:45:37.050
<v Speaker 1>he's a real tough guy to relate to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think people really do relate to</v>

1052
00:45:37.051 --> 00:45:38.670
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what they relate to is the</v>

1053
00:45:38.671 --> 00:45:41.910
<v Speaker 1>possibility that he may win and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to be on the camp of a winner.</v>

1054
00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:44.460
<v Speaker 1>So like a football team that they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>get behind.</v>

1055
00:45:44.461 --> 00:45:46.050
<v Speaker 1>They don't really give a shit about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>players.</v>

1056
00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:48.930
<v Speaker 1>They just decide we're going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're fucking winning.</v>

1057
00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:51.240
<v Speaker 1>We're winning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're trump trump's winning.</v>

1058
00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:55.590
<v Speaker 1>But the trump winning all those</v>
<v Speaker 1>dickheads.</v>

1059
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:56.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

1060
00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:58.320
<v Speaker 1>But they also say the things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1061
00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:00.690
<v Speaker 1>like he speaks like I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's,</v>

1062
00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:02.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't want a president who speaks</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1063
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:06.390
<v Speaker 1>and I do feel fairly intelligent guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want my president to be wasting harder</v>

1064
00:46:06.391 --> 00:46:06.780
<v Speaker 1>than me.</v>

1065
00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:09.060
<v Speaker 1>I would like a really articulate Obama</v>
<v Speaker 1>type guy,</v>

1066
00:46:09.061 --> 00:46:10.740
<v Speaker 1>but that didn't work out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1067
00:46:10.741 --> 00:46:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Had the Obama type guy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we were hoping for.</v>

1068
00:46:14.131 --> 00:46:16.110
<v Speaker 1>Like when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Bush was in office,</v>

1069
00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:19.530
<v Speaker 1>Obama was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking recipe man.</v>

1070
00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:23.010
<v Speaker 1>We want a black guy who's super</v>
<v Speaker 1>articulate,</v>

1071
00:46:23.011 --> 00:46:25.830
<v Speaker 1>really intelligent and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of relax.</v>

1072
00:46:25.831 --> 00:46:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Everybody would always race bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1073
00:46:27.511 --> 00:46:29.220
<v Speaker 1>clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has nothing to do with race,</v>

1074
00:46:29.221 --> 00:46:32.220
<v Speaker 1>it's about culture and circumstances and</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are you growing up?</v>

1075
00:46:32.221 --> 00:46:33.420
<v Speaker 1>Look at this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's black.</v>

1076
00:46:33.421 --> 00:46:35.370
<v Speaker 1>He's smarter than all of us were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good luck.</v>

1077
00:46:35.371 --> 00:46:36.930
<v Speaker 1>He's liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to fix everything.</v>

1078
00:46:36.931 --> 00:46:39.070
<v Speaker 1>He's going to relax everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't want to.</v>

1079
00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Guantanamo Bay wants to get us out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraq.</v>

1080
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:43.590
<v Speaker 1>We made it through this Bush thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't.</v>

1081
00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:47.110
<v Speaker 1>Civilization collapsed and then he's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>office in his own.</v>

1082
00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:49.740
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of the same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He talks better.</v>

1083
00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:51.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of the same shit is going</v>

1084
00:46:51.781 --> 00:46:53.790
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the biggest problem is that he's</v>

1085
00:46:53.791 --> 00:46:58.140
<v Speaker 1>too reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's too reasonable and the people</v>

1086
00:46:58.141 --> 00:47:00.840
<v Speaker 1>who disagree with him or being</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely unreasonable and you can't</v>

1087
00:47:00.841 --> 00:47:01.411
<v Speaker 1>just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1088
00:47:01.411 --> 00:47:03.750
<v Speaker 1>let's look at both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If one side is being a Dick,</v>

1089
00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:06.240
<v Speaker 1>you don't look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like CNN will do that.</v>

1090
00:47:06.241 --> 00:47:06.691
<v Speaker 1>Where they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1091
00:47:06.691 --> 00:47:08.100
<v Speaker 1>let's present both sides of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>

1092
00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:11.370
<v Speaker 1>Here's one person against pedophilia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's talk to someone who's for</v>

1093
00:47:11.371 --> 00:47:12.210
<v Speaker 1>pedophilia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

1094
00:47:12.211 --> 00:47:14.300
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't give that guy airtime.</v>

1095
00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:16.230
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't ever talk to that guy.</v>

1096
00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:17.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1097
00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:20.970
<v Speaker 1>So the people who you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who want to take rights away and who</v>

1098
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.820
<v Speaker 1>want to convince poor people to vote</v>
<v Speaker 1>against their own best interests,</v>

1099
00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:27.210
<v Speaker 1>like you don't give them equal time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they do well.</v>

1100
00:47:27.211 --> 00:47:30.130
<v Speaker 1>The problem is you're dealing with right</v>

1101
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:33.880
<v Speaker 3>and left and then again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people get really tribal.</v>

1102
00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:35.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they're on a team,</v>

1103
00:47:35.351 --> 00:47:37.610
<v Speaker 3>they get super tribal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I told,</v>

1104
00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.600
<v Speaker 3>told us before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's always struck me as being</v>

1105
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:42.940
<v Speaker 3>really bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was with a buddy of mine is a writer</v>

1106
00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:46.090
<v Speaker 3>and he was talking about the election.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1107
00:47:46.091 --> 00:47:49.180
<v Speaker 3>we have to win in Idaho if we went in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Idaho or Iowa.</v>

1108
00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:51.130
<v Speaker 3>We went in Iowa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got it wrapped up.</v>

1109
00:47:51.131 --> 00:47:51.851
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is this?</v>

1110
00:47:51.851 --> 00:47:53.890
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess as we shit,</v>

1111
00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:55.060
<v Speaker 3>it's like the Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>

1112
00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:56.470
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're on a team,</v>

1113
00:47:56.590 --> 00:47:57.640
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're on a team,</v>

1114
00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:59.440
<v Speaker 3>you're fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the mariners,</v>

1115
00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:02.200
<v Speaker 3>this is the marriage versus the raiders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got your,</v>

1116
00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:07.060
<v Speaker 3>you've got this weird team mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's entirely one of the</v>

1117
00:48:07.061 --> 00:48:10.990
<v Speaker 3>things that is real comfortable for</v>
<v Speaker 3>people to fall into when it comes to</v>

1118
00:48:10.991 --> 00:48:13.840
<v Speaker 3>elections.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's one of the reasons why I think</v>

1119
00:48:13.841 --> 00:48:17.350
<v Speaker 3>we need way more parties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least at least that way we'll have</v>

1120
00:48:17.351 --> 00:48:22.351
<v Speaker 3>more teams because this one is two team</v>
<v Speaker 3>option is like if every fucking year it</v>

1121
00:48:22.621 --> 00:48:25.980
<v Speaker 3>was a celtics versus the Lakers in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>NBA finals game,</v>

1122
00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:28.110
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't you be tired of that after</v>
<v Speaker 3>awhile?</v>

1123
00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.580
<v Speaker 3>Well that's I think how America feels</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the election.</v>

1124
00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:33.280
<v Speaker 3>That's why the ratings are down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why people aren't really paying</v>

1125
00:48:33.281 --> 00:48:36.070
<v Speaker 3>attention that much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why people are so frustrated by</v>

1126
00:48:36.071 --> 00:48:38.440
<v Speaker 3>the choices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't be kind of just two</v>

1127
00:48:38.441 --> 00:48:39.250
<v Speaker 3>choices.</v>

1128
00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:40.510
<v Speaker 2>Well I used to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1129
00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:42.850
<v Speaker 2>very politically minded and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and active.</v>

1130
00:48:42.851 --> 00:48:47.110
<v Speaker 2>And I used to do a lot of like everybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>should go out and vote and then I talked</v>

1131
00:48:47.111 --> 00:48:48.640
<v Speaker 2>to more and more people and then I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

1132
00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:49.710
<v Speaker 2>not everybody.</v>

1133
00:48:50.570 --> 00:48:54.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it would be nice if we didn't have</v>

1134
00:48:54.411 --> 00:48:56.510
<v Speaker 3>a representative government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1135
00:48:56.570 --> 00:48:57.830
<v Speaker 3>it would be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

1136
00:48:57.831 --> 00:49:00.260
<v Speaker 3>if you didn't have like one like super</v>
<v Speaker 3>delegates,</v>

1137
00:49:00.261 --> 00:49:02.990
<v Speaker 3>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean you don't have to vote</v>

1138
00:49:02.991 --> 00:49:04.510
<v Speaker 3>for the people that you're Stateville</v>

1139
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:08.650
<v Speaker 2>superdelegates were basically to keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesse Jackson out of office.</v>

1140
00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:10.660
<v Speaker 2>Like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how they started.</v>

1141
00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:11.590
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1142
00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:14.230
<v Speaker 2>When Jesse Jackson was starting to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>some heat and I think it was 1980,</v>

1143
00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:17.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly there was 80 or 84,</v>

1144
00:49:17.921 --> 00:49:19.720
<v Speaker 2>I forget,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a suddenly superdelegates</v>

1145
00:49:19.721 --> 00:49:21.180
<v Speaker 2>came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but good job.</v>

1146
00:49:21.181 --> 00:49:24.610
<v Speaker 2>Super d'elegance kept that fucking demon</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the White House.</v>

1147
00:49:24.611 --> 00:49:27.970
<v Speaker 2>Not only super delegates though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even the delegates of the electoral</v>

1148
00:49:27.971 --> 00:49:30.550
<v Speaker 2>college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have to vote the way their</v>

1149
00:49:30.551 --> 00:49:32.410
<v Speaker 2>constituents do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1150
00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:35.740
<v Speaker 2>there was a time when one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was in Minnesota,</v>

1151
00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:39.280
<v Speaker 2>accidentally wrote down the name of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>vice president in both slots for</v>

1152
00:49:39.281 --> 00:49:40.360
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vice president.</v>

1153
00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:43.990
<v Speaker 2>So his vote didn't count and that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 30,000 people that he was</v>

1154
00:49:43.991 --> 00:49:44.824
<v Speaker 2>representing.</v>

1155
00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:46.070
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

1156
00:49:46.070 --> 00:49:49.780
<v Speaker 2>And just because he was a fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like you,</v>

1157
00:49:49.850 --> 00:49:52.520
<v Speaker 2>you can actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're now obviously people wouldn't</v>

1158
00:49:52.521 --> 00:49:54.230
<v Speaker 2>do it for the most part because you'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

1159
00:49:54.231 --> 00:49:56.810
<v Speaker 2>oh well then they lose the ability to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and that's all the little power they</v>

1160
00:49:56.811 --> 00:49:58.790
<v Speaker 2>have in their life is to be a delegate</v>
<v Speaker 2>at this convention.</v>

1161
00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:04.120
<v Speaker 2>But the fact of the matter is that like</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York state can vote 100 percent for</v>

1162
00:50:04.311 --> 00:50:07.970
<v Speaker 2>a Democrat and then the electoral</v>
<v Speaker 2>college can go and just vote for</v>

1163
00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:09.260
<v Speaker 2>Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can just,</v>

1164
00:50:09.350 --> 00:50:11.300
<v Speaker 2>they can do it if they want to or vote</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a Democrat,</v>

1165
00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:12.500
<v Speaker 2>they can write someone in if they want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

1166
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.860
<v Speaker 3>It's a ridiculous idea that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>conceived back when you were in.</v>

1167
00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:17.670
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't communicate with people</v>
<v Speaker 3>easily.</v>

1168
00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:18.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1169
00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:21.820
<v Speaker 2>It was that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the point of it was that like not</v>

1170
00:50:21.821 --> 00:50:25.000
<v Speaker 2>everyone was qualified to vote because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't hear things.</v>

1171
00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:26.590
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they would be like,</v>

1172
00:50:26.591 --> 00:50:28.220
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the representative government.</v>

1173
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:28.711
<v Speaker 3>They'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1174
00:50:28.711 --> 00:50:31.160
<v Speaker 3>learn from what their people want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they'll take that over there.</v>

1175
00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:33.980
<v Speaker 3>And it was a wonderful idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now it's bullshit.</v>

1176
00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:35.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's ridiculous.</v>

1177
00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:37.040
<v Speaker 3>And it's time has gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1178
00:50:37.041 --> 00:50:38.360
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we,</v>

1179
00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:40.190
<v Speaker 3>this is the point that I always bring</v>
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>

1180
00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:42.230
<v Speaker 3>if we didn't have a system of government</v>
<v Speaker 3>in place,</v>

1181
00:50:42.231 --> 00:50:45.410
<v Speaker 3>we had all these people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all just woke up today who would say</v>

1182
00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:49.280
<v Speaker 3>we need one person to run it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one who would say that we need one</v>

1183
00:50:49.281 --> 00:50:53.380
<v Speaker 3>person to be representative of the state</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the people can't tell everybody</v>

1184
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:54.590
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will you have an email now?</v>

1185
00:50:54.591 --> 00:50:56.090
<v Speaker 3>We have twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have facebook,</v>

1186
00:50:56.091 --> 00:50:57.380
<v Speaker 3>we have poles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have.</v>

1187
00:50:57.550 --> 00:51:00.230
<v Speaker 3>There's ways to find out what people</v>
<v Speaker 3>want and people don't want to.</v>

1188
00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:04.730
<v Speaker 3>Representative government in 2016 is</v>
<v Speaker 3>like writing with feathers.</v>

1189
00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:07.760
<v Speaker 3>It's like some old stupid shit that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't need anymore.</v>

1190
00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:10.580
<v Speaker 3>We should make them right with feathers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who should make them wear powdered wigs</v>

1191
00:51:10.581 --> 00:51:11.870
<v Speaker 3>to those fucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1192
00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:14.450
<v Speaker 3>Feel like you want this office while it</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes with a couple of things.</v>

1193
00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:16.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you want to be like one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>those people,</v>

1194
00:51:16.821 --> 00:51:18.950
<v Speaker 3>you should dress like one of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that invented it.</v>

1195
00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:22.940
<v Speaker 3>Then there'd be no hillary email scandal</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it would just be like maybe she</v>

1196
00:51:22.941 --> 00:51:25.080
<v Speaker 3>wrote on the wrong kind of parchment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1197
00:51:25.081 --> 00:51:27.560
<v Speaker 3>she wrote on the actual animal skins and</v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

1198
00:51:27.561 --> 00:51:29.240
<v Speaker 3>we don't do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hillary,</v>

1199
00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:32.230
<v Speaker 3>you're doing old school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's doing old school with her non</v>

1200
00:51:32.231 --> 00:51:33.230
<v Speaker 3>encrypted email,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1201
00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:34.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you talked about,</v>

1202
00:51:34.581 --> 00:51:37.280
<v Speaker 3>I assume you've talked about the gorilla</v>
<v Speaker 3>already.</v>

1203
00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:38.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we kind of talked about it a little.</v>

1204
00:51:38.931 --> 00:51:40.670
<v Speaker 3>Did we think we did?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1205
00:51:40.671 --> 00:51:41.880
<v Speaker 3>That's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1206
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:43.970
<v Speaker 3>it's fucked up for the zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The zoo fucked up.</v>

1207
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.850
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't make it so God damn easy</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get in the gorilla tank.</v>

1208
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:48.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1209
00:51:48.331 --> 00:51:50.900
<v Speaker 3>So on this one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know exactly what happened on</v>

1210
00:51:50.901 --> 00:51:53.870
<v Speaker 3>this one cause I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to kind of block it out.</v>

1211
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:57.470
<v Speaker 3>I saw the whole thing so that the kid</v>
<v Speaker 3>kid fell in.</v>

1212
00:51:57.650 --> 00:51:59.720
<v Speaker 3>Was it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was it like a kid falling in where the</v>

1213
00:51:59.721 --> 00:52:02.180
<v Speaker 3>parent was at fault or was it a kid</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing something they shouldn't have</v>

1214
00:52:02.181 --> 00:52:02.661
<v Speaker 3>done?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1215
00:52:02.661 --> 00:52:04.340
<v Speaker 3>the kid was doing something and</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't have done,</v>

1216
00:52:04.341 --> 00:52:05.810
<v Speaker 3>but the parents weren't watching the</v>
<v Speaker 3>kid.</v>

1217
00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:06.783
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1218
00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:09.800
<v Speaker 3>the zoo made it way too easy to get into</v>
<v Speaker 3>the grill and closure.</v>

1219
00:52:09.850 --> 00:52:14.150
<v Speaker 3>The kid got through the fence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fell down into this water.</v>

1220
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:19.390
<v Speaker 3>The gorilla came in and scooped up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The kid arguably saved the kid but was</v>

1221
00:52:20.211 --> 00:52:23.300
<v Speaker 3>handling it in a way that it could</v>
<v Speaker 3>handle a gorilla baby,</v>

1222
00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:26.420
<v Speaker 3>but a human baby,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just ripped the arms off the kid.</v>

1223
00:52:26.421 --> 00:52:30.500
<v Speaker 3>He could really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really hurt it and I just don't think a</v>

1224
00:52:30.501 --> 00:52:35.390
<v Speaker 3>gorilla is even aware of how fragile a</v>
<v Speaker 3>three year old human being is as opposed</v>

1225
00:52:35.391 --> 00:52:35.750
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

1226
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:39.170
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever had a three year old champ</v>
<v Speaker 3>or three year old girl in near you?</v>

1227
00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:41.000
<v Speaker 3>A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't say I've ever had that</v>

1228
00:52:41.001 --> 00:52:43.250
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was on a TV show.</v>

1229
00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:47.300
<v Speaker 3>It was on his radio and they brought in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a champ for a scene in this two year old</v>

1230
00:52:47.301 --> 00:52:51.770
<v Speaker 3>chimp with a diaper on was like I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>holding it and it was was beating on me.</v>

1231
00:52:51.771 --> 00:52:53.780
<v Speaker 3>It was like hit me in the back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like playing around with me.</v>

1232
00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:59.070
<v Speaker 3>They're unbelievably strong and sinewy</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a little tiny bodybuilder.</v>

1233
00:52:59.690 --> 00:53:02.840
<v Speaker 3>Like they don't feel like a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I have little kids and when you</v>

1234
00:53:02.841 --> 00:53:05.060
<v Speaker 3>pick up a little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all soft and they feel like</v>

1235
00:53:05.061 --> 00:53:05.900
<v Speaker 3>little kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

1236
00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:09.380
<v Speaker 3>they're mushy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This just champ was not mushy and I</v>

1237
00:53:09.381 --> 00:53:14.381
<v Speaker 3>think this gorilla probably had no idea</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to handle a baby softly,</v>

1238
00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:16.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably our toddler really didn't,</v>

1239
00:53:16.981 --> 00:53:19.490
<v Speaker 3>didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they panicked and then they shot the</v>

1240
00:53:19.491 --> 00:53:22.340
<v Speaker 3>gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it seems to me that there's gotta be</v>

1241
00:53:22.341 --> 00:53:24.920
<v Speaker 3>a better way to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I could see the parents being,</v>

1242
00:53:25.110 --> 00:53:26.130
<v Speaker 3>fuck that gorilla,</v>

1243
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:27.180
<v Speaker 1>shoot it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot it.</v>

1244
00:53:27.181 --> 00:53:28.650
<v Speaker 1>I want my kid back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1245
00:53:28.651 --> 00:53:30.750
<v Speaker 1>But I could see the gorilla being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck those parents.</v>

1246
00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:32.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I like people more than I like</v>

1247
00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:33.211
<v Speaker 1>gorillas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

1248
00:53:33.211 --> 00:53:35.490
<v Speaker 1>And I love your joke about team people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1249
00:53:35.650 --> 00:53:36.540
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

1250
00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:38.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a bit I,</v>

1251
00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:40.570
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was a there.</v>

1252
00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:43.620
<v Speaker 1>So there was a bit I used to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a store in Chicago like 15</v>

1253
00:53:43.621 --> 00:53:47.580
<v Speaker 1>years ago where a woman was holding her</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby over gorilla pit.</v>

1254
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:48.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that.</v>

1255
00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:51.780
<v Speaker 1>Like holding it straight up and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>drop the baby and on that one the</v>

1256
00:53:51.781 --> 00:53:53.870
<v Speaker 1>gorilla saved the kid and picked it up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1257
00:53:53.970 --> 00:53:56.310
<v Speaker 1>and kept until the zookeeper could give</v>
<v Speaker 1>it back to the mother.</v>

1258
00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:58.800
<v Speaker 1>And the joke I used to do is be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

1259
00:53:58.810 --> 00:54:00.900
<v Speaker 1>give it back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like at that point,</v>

1260
00:54:00.901 --> 00:54:05.490
<v Speaker 1>a gorilla is a better parent than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>person who wants you voluntarily dangle</v>

1261
00:54:05.491 --> 00:54:09.600
<v Speaker 1>your baby over a wild animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's death you giving of the baby away.</v>

1262
00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:10.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've even made it</v>

1263
00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:15.680
<v Speaker 3>way too easy for people to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People survived very little adversity.</v>

1264
00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:19.190
<v Speaker 3>We survive with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's easy access to food,</v>

1265
00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:21.980
<v Speaker 3>easy access to employment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you get fired,</v>

1266
00:54:21.981 --> 00:54:25.100
<v Speaker 3>you get to sue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're incompetent completely,</v>

1267
00:54:25.101 --> 00:54:27.800
<v Speaker 3>you can claim that you were harassed at</v>
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

1268
00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:32.330
<v Speaker 3>There's so many loopholes and it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're so nerfed.</v>

1269
00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:36.530
<v Speaker 3>Every sharp edge is covered with foam</v>
<v Speaker 3>and everyone's wearing a helmet.</v>

1270
00:54:36.590 --> 00:54:39.200
<v Speaker 3>The nerfing of America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is what we got left.</v>

1271
00:54:39.201 --> 00:54:43.490
<v Speaker 3>We've got these fucking idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got a bunch of really dumb people</v>

1272
00:54:43.491 --> 00:54:46.970
<v Speaker 3>that are allowed to fuck and have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can't stop people from having</v>

1273
00:54:46.971 --> 00:54:49.460
<v Speaker 3>kids because then someone can try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop you.</v>

1274
00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:50.700
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like your belief,</v>

1275
00:54:50.701 --> 00:54:52.520
<v Speaker 3>Steve Hofstetter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a crazy liberal.</v>

1276
00:54:52.521 --> 00:54:54.850
<v Speaker 3>You think you should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you should be able to have a</v>

1277
00:54:55.310 --> 00:54:59.150
<v Speaker 3>nation that's not under God and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna raise your children without God.</v>

1278
00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:02.420
<v Speaker 3>That's child abuse and then you on my</v>
<v Speaker 3>show the other day,</v>

1279
00:55:04.450 --> 00:55:07.070
<v Speaker 3>nobody shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1280
00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:12.050
<v Speaker 3>I just think they're human beings need a</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain amount of adversity.</v>

1281
00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:16.490
<v Speaker 3>We need a certain amount of difficulty</v>
<v Speaker 3>to overcome to learn those lessons,</v>

1282
00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:20.480
<v Speaker 3>to filter that experience down into your</v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior and when you don't learn those</v>

1283
00:55:20.481 --> 00:55:24.140
<v Speaker 3>lessons and you just live this muted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nerved up world,</v>

1284
00:55:24.290 --> 00:55:26.420
<v Speaker 3>then you're holding your fucking baby</v>
<v Speaker 3>over the gorilla tank because you</v>

1285
00:55:26.421 --> 00:55:27.860
<v Speaker 3>getting a little thrill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's,</v>

1286
00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:35.540
<v Speaker 3>whoops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm dumb.</v>

1287
00:55:35.541 --> 00:55:38.360
<v Speaker 3>I dropped the baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like you drop your cell phone just</v>

1288
00:55:38.361 --> 00:55:40.640
<v Speaker 3>like you drop your keys and the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>drainage ditch.</v>

1289
00:55:40.641 --> 00:55:42.290
<v Speaker 3>You're a dummy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You drop shit.</v>

1290
00:55:42.291 --> 00:55:44.240
<v Speaker 3>You're a stupid fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And not supposed to be alive.</v>

1291
00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:46.670
<v Speaker 3>Should have been eaten by wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hundreds of years ago.</v>

1292
00:55:47.450 --> 00:55:49.580
<v Speaker 3>The world was safe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would have been the one who walked</v>

1293
00:55:49.581 --> 00:55:52.040
<v Speaker 3>off the trail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go find a better word to</v>

1294
00:55:52.041 --> 00:55:54.980
<v Speaker 3>the council and the wolf's would have</v>
<v Speaker 3>eaten you and no one would have heard</v>

1295
00:55:54.981 --> 00:55:56.990
<v Speaker 3>from you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what it's supposed to happen</v>

1296
00:55:56.991 --> 00:55:57.860
<v Speaker 3>to those types of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well</v>

1297
00:55:58.050 --> 00:56:00.510
<v Speaker 1>it is Darwin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan.</v>

1298
00:56:00.810 --> 00:56:01.770
<v Speaker 1>Big Fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Fan.</v>

1299
00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:03.630
<v Speaker 1>He had some good ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris bowers,</v>

1300
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:05.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a comic out of.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's awesome man.</v>

1307
00:56:15.930 --> 00:56:17.640
<v Speaker 1>It's even better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had new location now.</v>

1308
00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:19.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh no shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys moved A.</v>

1309
00:56:19.711 --> 00:56:21.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a balcony and everything now.</v>

1310
00:56:21.661 --> 00:56:22.850
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>

1311
00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:24.490
<v Speaker 1>it like a small theater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1312
00:56:24.491 --> 00:56:26.530
<v Speaker 1>that's terrific man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a great club.</v>

1313
00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:27.790
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a fun one.</v>

1314
00:56:27.850 --> 00:56:29.620
<v Speaker 1>Everybody loves that place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool though.</v>

1315
00:56:29.621 --> 00:56:30.690
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know you own that place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1316
00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:33.280
<v Speaker 1>Good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fucking entrepreneur as well.</v>

1317
00:56:33.281 --> 00:56:36.010
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so bowers has a great theory where,</v>

1318
00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:36.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1319
00:56:36.781 --> 00:56:39.610
<v Speaker 1>the way to I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prevent the stupid people in the</v>

1320
00:56:39.611 --> 00:56:44.611
<v Speaker 1>overpopulation is if everyone is</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically sterilized and you have to</v>

1321
00:56:45.641 --> 00:56:47.890
<v Speaker 1>take something in order to be able to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>pregnant.</v>

1322
00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:52.570
<v Speaker 1>But the only way you get that pill is</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to take that pill every day.</v>

1323
00:56:52.571 --> 00:56:54.490
<v Speaker 1>You don't take a pill to stop yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>from being pregnant.</v>

1324
00:56:54.491 --> 00:56:56.080
<v Speaker 1>You take a pill to get yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>pregnant,</v>

1325
00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:59.110
<v Speaker 1>so you have to take that pill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both partners would have to take that</v>

1326
00:56:59.111 --> 00:57:04.111
<v Speaker 1>pill every day for six months because if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't commit to taking a pill every</v>

1327
00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:06.730
<v Speaker 1>day for six months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't raise a kid.</v>

1328
00:57:06.731 --> 00:57:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's so easy for people to just do</v>

1329
00:57:08.621 --> 00:57:09.520
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not.</v>

1330
00:57:09.550 --> 00:57:13.840
<v Speaker 1>That's not enough of a fucking start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be like one of those crows</v>

1331
00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:18.850
<v Speaker 1>have to get a crumb out of a tube and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to use one tool to get the</v>

1332
00:57:18.851 --> 00:57:23.320
<v Speaker 1>other tool to get the third tool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how it should be.</v>

1333
00:57:23.350 --> 00:57:25.000
<v Speaker 1>It's too fucking easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just take a pill.</v>

1334
00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:27.970
<v Speaker 1>You should have to do a puzzle everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That should give you a puzzle,</v>

1335
00:57:27.971 --> 00:57:30.310
<v Speaker 1>and if you fail creasing difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get a pill,</v>

1336
00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:35.460
<v Speaker 1>so you get six months of correct answers</v>
<v Speaker 1>to puzzles to get your pills.</v>

1337
00:57:35.770 --> 00:57:37.390
<v Speaker 1>That's the only way she'd be able to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>your pills.</v>

1338
00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:40.720
<v Speaker 1>I think that's how chipotle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gave away free Burrito once on their</v>

1339
00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:44.400
<v Speaker 1>annual anniversary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they did it that way for people the</v>

1340
00:57:44.410 --> 00:57:45.350
<v Speaker 1>fucking four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1341
00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:47.380
<v Speaker 1>five would be a breeze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1342
00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:50.740
<v Speaker 1>it would be nobody just be a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>people waving at each other.</v>

1343
00:57:50.741 --> 00:57:54.190
<v Speaker 1>We made it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever watch you ever watch like a</v>

1344
00:57:54.310 --> 00:57:56.860
<v Speaker 1>period piece?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Television where they run into people</v>

1345
00:57:56.861 --> 00:57:58.500
<v Speaker 1>they know like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a mad men.</v>

1346
00:57:58.630 --> 00:58:01.130
<v Speaker 1>They would always like run into people</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the restaurant that they would know</v>

1347
00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:02.530
<v Speaker 1>and part of me is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1348
00:58:02.531 --> 00:58:03.670
<v Speaker 1>well that's convenient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I'm like,</v>

1349
00:58:03.730 --> 00:58:04.300
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1350
00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:07.400
<v Speaker 1>There are fewer people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were fewer people then it was.</v>

1351
00:58:07.470 --> 00:58:09.250
<v Speaker 1>It seems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems possible.</v>

1352
00:58:09.730 --> 00:58:13.390
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was possible in the nineties when I</v>

1353
00:58:13.391 --> 00:58:16.330
<v Speaker 1>moved here in 1994,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was half as many people.</v>

1354
00:58:16.530 --> 00:58:20.140
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what the actual statistic was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty sure is half as many</v>

1355
00:58:20.141 --> 00:58:24.310
<v Speaker 1>people like when you would get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd get on the highway and the traffic</v>

1356
00:58:24.311 --> 00:58:26.170
<v Speaker 1>would be bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wouldn't be that bad.</v>

1357
00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:29.020
<v Speaker 1>Would be no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember people talking about getting</v>

1358
00:58:29.021 --> 00:58:31.240
<v Speaker 1>from Santa Monica to the valley in 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

1359
00:58:31.970 --> 00:58:34.540
<v Speaker 1>What exactly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ten minutes,</v>

1360
00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:36.220
<v Speaker 1>that's what it wanted to drive a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Delorean,</v>

1361
00:58:36.850 --> 00:58:38.570
<v Speaker 1>regular car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just get in your car and drive.</v>

1362
00:58:38.571 --> 00:58:41.620
<v Speaker 1>And this back when cars were slow as</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit and the brakes were terrible.</v>

1363
00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:44.020
<v Speaker 1>There was no traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just get around.</v>

1364
00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:45.940
<v Speaker 1>It's only nine miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

1365
00:58:46.270 --> 00:58:48.580
<v Speaker 1>They just did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same as a a,</v>

1366
00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:49.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>planes.</v>

1367
00:58:49.601 --> 00:58:54.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've only been flying about 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>years but 20 years ago and now that's</v>

1368
00:58:54.371 --> 00:58:56.620
<v Speaker 1>part of because they do the spoke</v>
<v Speaker 1>garbage now where they,</v>

1369
00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:58.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to fly through Cincinnati to go</v>

1370
00:58:58.871 --> 00:59:01.420
<v Speaker 1>to Denver or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

1371
00:59:01.421 --> 00:59:03.730
<v Speaker 1>everything's full.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every single flight is full.</v>

1372
00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:07.680
<v Speaker 1>Like the idea when someone doesn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a seat next to you on if it's a</v>

1373
00:59:07.690 --> 00:59:08.470
<v Speaker 1>Christmas party.</v>

1374
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well how about when they say,</v>

1375
00:59:10.841 --> 00:59:14.320
<v Speaker 1>we've oversold this flight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking for volunteers.</v>

1376
00:59:14.830 --> 00:59:16.240
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're selling some shit.</v>

1377
00:59:16.241 --> 00:59:18.610
<v Speaker 1>You don't even really have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They absolutely do that.</v>

1378
00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:21.380
<v Speaker 1>But in fairness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can do that with comedy clubs too</v>

1379
00:59:21.381 --> 00:59:23.180
<v Speaker 1>because there's always a percentage of</v>
<v Speaker 1>no shows.</v>

1380
00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:25.270
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do we,</v>

1381
00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:27.230
<v Speaker 1>do you do that at mortise?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1382
00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:28.190
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've done it,</v>

1383
00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:30.920
<v Speaker 1>but it's not by a high percentage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like because usually our no show</v>

1384
00:59:30.921 --> 00:59:33.980
<v Speaker 1>percentage will be like 10 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so will oversell by like five percent</v>

1385
00:59:34.410 --> 00:59:36.470
<v Speaker 1>because people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you have 100 people,</v>

1386
00:59:36.471 --> 00:59:39.920
<v Speaker 1>10 people won't show up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on the price of the ticket.</v>

1387
00:59:39.921 --> 00:59:42.020
<v Speaker 1>It depends on the act like with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a celebrity,</v>

1388
00:59:42.021 --> 00:59:43.760
<v Speaker 1>no show percentages of virtually</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

1389
00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:46.390
<v Speaker 1>But with like a typical day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1390
00:59:46.450 --> 00:59:47.630
<v Speaker 1>at a typical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

1391
00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:51.500
<v Speaker 1>we call it a just funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's good but no one has heard</v>

1392
00:59:51.501 --> 00:59:51.890
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>

1393
00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:52.850
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1394
00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:54.470
<v Speaker 1>plenty of times some will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

1395
00:59:54.471 --> 00:59:58.310
<v Speaker 1>let's get four tickets to the club and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they only have one friend like that</v>

1396
00:59:58.311 --> 01:00:00.410
<v Speaker 1>happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Babysitter canceled.</v>

1397
01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:01.640
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1398
01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:03.650
<v Speaker 1>it's too rainy out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone doesn't want to go.</v>

1399
01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:05.690
<v Speaker 1>There are a ton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tons of reasons,</v>

1400
01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:10.720
<v Speaker 1>but you can't fuck over the people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually paid and actually showed up.</v>

1401
01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:14.030
<v Speaker 1>Never once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not one time that you have extra chairs,</v>

1402
01:00:14.031 --> 01:00:16.990
<v Speaker 1>you can just shove them in places in</v>
<v Speaker 1>case everybody shows up if we have to.</v>

1403
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.970
<v Speaker 1>But what happens is on the ticket it</v>
<v Speaker 1>very specifically says like,</v>

1404
01:00:19.971 --> 01:00:21.920
<v Speaker 1>this is good until showtime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1405
01:00:21.921 --> 01:00:23.300
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is,</v>

1406
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:26.990
<v Speaker 1>even if there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if the no show rate is way less</v>

1407
01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:30.020
<v Speaker 1>than it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if there's weird anomaly where the</v>

1408
01:00:30.021 --> 01:00:34.440
<v Speaker 1>no show rate is like zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are still people who come late and</v>

1409
01:00:34.450 --> 01:00:35.283
<v Speaker 1>you can't come late.</v>

1410
01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:36.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you come late,</v>

1411
01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:39.200
<v Speaker 1>like you might get turned away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we tell everyone that even if you</v>

1412
01:00:39.201 --> 01:00:41.180
<v Speaker 1>have a ticket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we tell everyone that if you come late</v>

1413
01:00:41.181 --> 01:00:42.930
<v Speaker 1>you can get turned away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you get stuck in drama?</v>

1414
01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can call.</v>

1415
01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:45.200
<v Speaker 1>You can call and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1416

01:01:29.481 --> 01:01:31.790
<v Speaker 1>It's got a further the plot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't just be something that they</v>

1436
01:01:31.791 --> 01:01:32.690
<v Speaker 1>know is going to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:34.640
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to a musical.</v>

01:01:34.641 --> 01:01:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Well I should take that back because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>book of Mormon is fucking amazing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a musical.</v>

1440
01:01:39.650 --> 01:01:41.420

<v Speaker 1>avenue Q.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

1445
01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:54.260

<v Speaker 1>show in of the two.</v>

1446
01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:56.640
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was like a Broadway show with</v>

1453
01:02:07.041 --> 01:02:08.870
<v Speaker 1>puppets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sesame street on Broadway.</v>

<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1459
01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:22.360
<v Speaker 1>Spiderman turned off the dark eventually</v>
<v Speaker 1>turned on the dark because people were</v>

1460

<v Speaker 1>will fell.</v>

1462

<v Speaker 1>So my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

1463
01:02:27.871 --> 01:02:31.640

1464
01:02:31.650 --> 01:02:35.820
<v Speaker 1>which is like a frequent flyer points</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Broadway and so she would go to all</v>

1465
01:02:35.821 --> 01:02:40.821
<v Speaker 1>these shows and so she went to spiderman</v>
<v Speaker 1>like during the previews and she texted</v>

1466
01:02:41.371 --> 01:02:45.390
<v Speaker 1>me and she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the actors has been stuck for an</v>

1467
01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:47.850
<v Speaker 1>hour,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I bet you know how he feels like it's</v>

1471
01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:55.530
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was her.</v>

1472
01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:58.770
<v Speaker 1>She would go to all these shows and</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually like I wouldn't have to go</v>

1473
01:02:58.771 --> 01:03:00.930
<v Speaker 1>anymore because she took me to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>American idiot.</v>

1477
01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:11.670
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy that song specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish Joey Diaz was here right now</v>

1478
01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:13.320

<v Speaker 1>I like the song American idiot because</v>

1481
01:03:17.791 --> 01:03:22.620
<v Speaker 1>it caused people who it was about to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to enjoy it without knowing it was about</v>

1482
01:03:22.621 --> 01:03:24.570
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked the diversity of that,</v>

1483
01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:28.950
<v Speaker 1>but the musical was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like when I was 30 seconds in</v>

1484
01:03:28.951 --> 01:03:30.390
<v Speaker 1>before I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck this show.</v>

1485
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:33.510
<v Speaker 1>It was like watching the best painters</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world tried to play football.</v>

1486
01:03:34.530 --> 01:03:37.800
<v Speaker 1>It was horrific because like that's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny way of putting it.</v>

1487
01:03:37.801 --> 01:03:38.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>punk punk,</v>

1490
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:44.540
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time that's what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>movement it came out of and it's</v>

1491
01:03:44.550 --> 01:03:47.130
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be anti establishment and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole point of the show,</v>

1492
01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:50.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Broadway thing of it basically made</v>

1493
01:03:50.251 --> 01:03:52.800
<v Speaker 1>it like everybody's just jazz hands to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking green.</v>

1494
01:03:52.810 --> 01:03:55.920
<v Speaker 1>It was ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of showed what green day really is</v>

1495
01:03:55.921 --> 01:03:58.050
<v Speaker 1>all about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this green day was,</v>

1496
01:03:58.070 --> 01:04:00.840
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a manufactured outrage.</v>

1497
01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:03.840
<v Speaker 1>I was so disappointed because afterward</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1498
01:04:03.841 --> 01:04:05.850
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe they lend their name to</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1499
01:04:05.851 --> 01:04:07.320
<v Speaker 1>And then I looked it up and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

1500
01:04:07.321 --> 01:04:09.770
<v Speaker 1>they were in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1501
01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:12.120
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the end of it for me.</v>

1502
01:04:12.410 --> 01:04:15.330
<v Speaker 1>That's why everybody was correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's one of those things</v>

1503
01:04:15.331 --> 01:04:18.210
<v Speaker 1>where like people look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look on that guy's say that jared from</v>

1504
01:04:18.211 --> 01:04:19.350

<v Speaker 1>like who is that?</v>

1505

1506
01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:27.570
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it look like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that wasn't even a molestation.</v>

1507

<v Speaker 1>Joe Couple cigars on the far right with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two tone hair and the conveniently</v>

01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:34.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of that stuff.</v>

1518
01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:50.190
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1519
01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:53.790
<v Speaker 1>it's like what we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about suits coming in and</v>

1520
01:04:53.791 --> 01:04:56.280
<v Speaker 1>telling you what you can and can't say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're doing their being their</v>

1521
01:04:56.281 --> 01:04:59.220
<v Speaker 1>own suits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to formulate something</v>

1522
01:04:59.221 --> 01:05:01.680
<v Speaker 1>that they think America is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>absorb and then they're thinking about</v>

1523
01:05:01.681 --> 01:05:04.710
<v Speaker 1>buying yachts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So avenue q is a great show,</v>

1524
01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:10.080
<v Speaker 1>but the most fun part of watching it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching the old Broadway people</v>

1525
01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:14.520
<v Speaker 1>thinking that they're super naughty for</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to the show just like these,</v>

1526
01:05:14.521 --> 01:05:17.800
<v Speaker 1>like 60,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 year old women who like just couldn't</v>

1527
01:05:17.801 --> 01:05:18.160
<v Speaker 1>believe.</v>

1528
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:19.780
<v Speaker 3>Like they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>masturbation.</v>

1529
01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:21.550
<v Speaker 3>Like just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1530
01:05:21.551 --> 01:05:23.800
<v Speaker 3>that was kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had fun watching people watch it.</v>

1531
01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:25.360
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I was going to go to Broadway,</v>

1532
01:05:25.361 --> 01:05:27.260
<v Speaker 3>that would be kind of why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would go,</v>

1533
01:05:27.261 --> 01:05:32.261
<v Speaker 3>I would go to people watch the really</v>
<v Speaker 3>upper crust rich crowd of Manhattan</v>

1534
01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:35.410
<v Speaker 3>Nights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that have homes in the</v>

1535
01:05:35.410 --> 01:05:37.090
<v Speaker 3>Hamptons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like those people that go to all those</v>

1536
01:05:37.091 --> 01:05:39.760
<v Speaker 3>Broadway shows and that's their social</v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1537
01:05:39.790 --> 01:05:42.160
<v Speaker 3>That's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go to parties,</v>

1538
01:05:42.161 --> 01:05:45.790
<v Speaker 3>they dress really well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they eat really well and they go to the</v>

1539
01:05:45.791 --> 01:05:49.150
<v Speaker 3>finest restaurants in town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They always get a table at the finest</v>

1540
01:05:49.151 --> 01:05:53.140
<v Speaker 3>restaurants and here they are and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's like their hobby is being</v>

1541
01:05:53.141 --> 01:05:57.370
<v Speaker 3>rich and doing rich people things and if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to be cultured,</v>

1542
01:05:57.670 --> 01:06:01.690
<v Speaker 3>you have to read the New York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to read the New Yorker and you</v>

1543
01:06:01.691 --> 01:06:04.900
<v Speaker 3>have to go to these musicals when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>come out and you have to go to Broadway.</v>

1544
01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:07.030
<v Speaker 3>When it comes out there's a new player.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be there.</v>

1545
01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:09.880
<v Speaker 3>Yes we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have season tickets to the Broadway</v>

1546
01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:12.220
<v Speaker 3>or whatever the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have season tickets to Broadway.</v>

1547
01:06:12.370 --> 01:06:13.203
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't.</v>

1548
01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:14.260
<v Speaker 3>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do.</v>

1549
01:06:14.610 --> 01:06:17.250
<v Speaker 3>They're like multi ticket packages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a.</v>

1550
01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:20.350
<v Speaker 3>those people have to do everything they</v>
<v Speaker 3>can to be cultured,</v>

1551
01:06:20.351 --> 01:06:22.360
<v Speaker 3>except actually talk to human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1552
01:06:22.361 --> 01:06:24.760
<v Speaker 3>they talked to a few human beings who</v>
<v Speaker 3>are exactly like them.</v>

1553
01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:27.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they don't talk to anyone who,</v>

1554
01:06:27.370 --> 01:06:28.390
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might,</v>

1555
01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:30.460
<v Speaker 3>they might know their gardener's name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1556
01:06:30.461 --> 01:06:32.370
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of people that are like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1557
01:06:32.371 --> 01:06:35.710
<v Speaker 3>that are just completely locked up and</v>
<v Speaker 3>consumption and that's the only thing</v>

1558
01:06:35.711 --> 01:06:37.960
<v Speaker 3>that they can discuss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had this neighbor,</v>

1559
01:06:38.110 --> 01:06:41.410
<v Speaker 3>I used to call them bling bling because</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bling bling always had,</v>

1560
01:06:41.411 --> 01:06:45.520
<v Speaker 3>like everything was shiny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He always had like expensive watches and</v>

1561
01:06:45.521 --> 01:06:47.050
<v Speaker 3>they always had the nicest cars.</v>

1562
01:06:47.290 --> 01:06:51.970
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't talk to the guy about</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything other than like cars and</v>

1563
01:06:51.971 --> 01:06:53.350
<v Speaker 3>houses,</v>

1568
01:07:00.210 --> 01:07:02.500
<v Speaker 3>Like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all he would talk about while he</v>

1569
01:07:02.501 --> 01:07:07.090
<v Speaker 3>was into was consumption.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was good for the property values?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1573
01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:13.150
<v Speaker 3>that was all he was into acquiring</v>
<v Speaker 3>items,</v>

1574
01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:16.480
<v Speaker 3>moving items around fixing items,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making items better.</v>

1575
01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:19.000
<v Speaker 3>But this was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was the American idiot.</v>

1576
01:07:19.001 --> 01:07:19.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1577
01:07:19.570 --> 01:07:21.290
<v Speaker 3>he was locked into that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1578
01:07:21.610 --> 01:07:24.870
<v Speaker 3>I knew this guy for years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean literally that is why I called</v>

1579
01:07:24.871 --> 01:07:25.481
<v Speaker 3>them blink,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blink.</v>

1580
01:07:25.481 --> 01:07:29.200
<v Speaker 3>We'd never had a conversation about</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything other than objects that he</v>

1581
01:07:29.201 --> 01:07:32.050
<v Speaker 3>wanted or objects that he saw that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>liked.</v>

1582
01:07:32.190 --> 01:07:33.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was really weird,</v>

1583
01:07:33.971 --> 01:07:35.950
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of people like that</v>
<v Speaker 3>out there.</v>

1584
01:07:36.130 --> 01:07:37.930
<v Speaker 3>Especially really rich people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1585
01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:42.040
<v Speaker 3>The uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when people make this argument about</v>

1586
01:07:42.070 --> 01:07:42.551
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1587
01:07:42.551 --> 01:07:43.181
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1588
01:07:43.181 --> 01:07:46.390
<v Speaker 3>we have to allow the rich to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>spend their money because it's for the</v>

1589
01:07:46.391 --> 01:07:48.520
<v Speaker 3>economy and that's why they shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1590
01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:50.230
<v Speaker 3>we shouldn't have higher taxes on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>rich.</v>

1591
01:07:50.231 --> 01:07:51.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like DC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How they,</v>

1592
01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:54.070
<v Speaker 3>how they spend it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you see the,</v>

1593
01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:59.300
<v Speaker 3>the ridiculousness that that has been</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's the problem with higher taxes</v>

1594
01:07:59.501 --> 01:08:01.470
<v Speaker 3>on the rich,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that like what,</v>

1595
01:08:01.471 --> 01:08:02.230
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is,</v>

1596
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:03.940
<v Speaker 3>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is capitalism like?</v>

1597
01:08:03.941 --> 01:08:05.170
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it a game?</v>

1598
01:08:05.171 --> 01:08:06.520
<v Speaker 3>And we'd try to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1599
01:08:06.730 --> 01:08:11.200
<v Speaker 3>if one person works harder and they make</v>
<v Speaker 3>more money and one person a is more</v>

1600
01:08:11.201 --> 01:08:12.730
<v Speaker 3>innovative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're more creative,</v>

1601
01:08:12.731 --> 01:08:14.920
<v Speaker 3>they figured out a way to extract more</v>
<v Speaker 3>money from the.</v>

1602
01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:15.980
<v Speaker 3>Should they</v>

1603
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:17.510
<v Speaker 1>be penalized?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1604
01:08:17.511 --> 01:08:20.960
<v Speaker 1>aren't we all trying to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we all trying to acquire money in</v>

1605
01:08:20.961 --> 01:08:22.010
<v Speaker 1>some way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shape or form?</v>

1606
01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:26.630
<v Speaker 1>And who is to say that one person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some Bill Gates type guy is better at it</v>

1607
01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:30.680
<v Speaker 1>so they should be penalized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it seems like you're trying to rig</v>

1608
01:08:30.681 --> 01:08:33.890
<v Speaker 1>the game because someone has just way</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking better at it.</v>

1609
01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:37.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the problem is that it's not.</v>

1610
01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:38.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a problem with people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are better at it.</v>

1611
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:42.290
<v Speaker 1>I have a problem with the people who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grandson of the person who was</v>

1612
01:08:42.291 --> 01:08:43.340
<v Speaker 1>better at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1613
01:08:43.341 --> 01:08:45.680
<v Speaker 1>That was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the idea of like,</v>

1614
01:08:45.710 --> 01:08:46.543
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1615
01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:48.830
<v Speaker 1>my uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my father's father's sperm was real</v>

1616
01:08:48.831 --> 01:08:51.770
<v Speaker 1>innovative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Heinz account has always had good</v>

1617
01:08:51.771 --> 01:08:53.060
<v Speaker 1>merit here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1618
01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:55.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That kind of stuff.</v>

1619
01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:56.890
<v Speaker 1>I inherited some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Money's a,</v>

1620
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:59.360
<v Speaker 1>that's a tricky one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's bad for the people</v>

1621
01:08:59.550 --> 01:09:00.200
<v Speaker 1>that get it.</v>

1622
01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:01.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at the,</v>

1623
01:09:01.641 --> 01:09:02.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1624
01:09:03.090 --> 01:09:06.050
<v Speaker 1>I look at the people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's that quote that I forget where</v>

1625
01:09:06.051 --> 01:09:08.000
<v Speaker 1>it's from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that quote that America is a nation</v>

1626
01:09:08.001 --> 01:09:12.710
<v Speaker 1>of temporarily embarrassed millionaires</v>
<v Speaker 1>that like everyone thinks that they're a</v>

1627
01:09:12.711 --> 01:09:14.810
<v Speaker 1>millionaire there just going through</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard times right now.</v>

1628
01:09:14.910 --> 01:09:15.920
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1629
01:09:16.190 --> 01:09:17.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's one of the reasons why poor</v>

1630
01:09:17.781 --> 01:09:19.500
<v Speaker 1>people vote for Republicans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1631
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:20.860
<v Speaker 1>They really think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1632
01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:25.900
<v Speaker 1>you need business new businesses who is</v>
<v Speaker 1>more anti poor people than Republicans,</v>

1633
01:09:27.230 --> 01:09:29.810
<v Speaker 1>but how many poor people wind up being</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative?</v>

1634
01:09:29.811 --> 01:09:32.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I want to say to those people is</v>

1635
01:09:32.031 --> 01:09:32.721
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>

1636
01:09:32.721 --> 01:09:34.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all want to be millionaires.</v>

1637
01:09:34.041 --> 01:09:36.470
<v Speaker 1>We all want to be successful and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful and we need a path to get</v>

1638
01:09:36.471 --> 01:09:38.360
<v Speaker 1>there and that's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But tell me this,</v>

1639
01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:40.550
<v Speaker 1>when you were 55 and you were working at</v>
<v Speaker 1>applebee's,</v>

1640
01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:41.630
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is your path?</v>

1641
01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:44.720
<v Speaker 1>Where from here to there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tell me.</v>

1642
01:09:44.721 --> 01:09:46.310
<v Speaker 1>You tell me what app you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>invent.</v>

1643
01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:51.290
<v Speaker 1>You tell me what you know you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to win on American idol as the old lady</v>

1644
01:09:51.350 --> 01:09:55.580
<v Speaker 1>like you tell me how the fuck are you</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to go from the lowest tax bracket</v>

1645
01:09:55.730 --> 01:10:00.110
<v Speaker 1>to the highest one when you're already</v>
<v Speaker 1>55 and your dream has gone,</v>

1646
01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:03.890
<v Speaker 1>but it can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See to say that it's kind of silly</v>

1647
01:10:03.891 --> 01:10:06.560
<v Speaker 1>because we've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been a million stories about</v>

1648
01:10:06.770 --> 01:10:10.700
<v Speaker 1>like someone who writes a book in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>fifties and they become rich.</v>

1649
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:14.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean all that stuff has happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of you,</v>

1650
01:10:14.271 --> 01:10:16.070
<v Speaker 1>but you have to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is,</v>

1651
01:10:16.071 --> 01:10:18.290
<v Speaker 1>you have to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're actually just taking all your</v>

1652
01:10:18.291 --> 01:10:21.200
<v Speaker 1>time and you're staying at applebee's</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you're drinking and then you</v>

1653
01:10:21.201 --> 01:10:22.640
<v Speaker 1>watch the TV and any falling asleep.</v>

1654
01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:24.110
<v Speaker 1>That pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1655
01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:26.990
<v Speaker 1>If that person said to me while I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been working on this novel for a very</v>

1656
01:10:26.991 --> 01:10:29.480
<v Speaker 1>long time and I have a lot of faith in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've sent it to a lot of publishers</v>

1657
01:10:29.481 --> 01:10:30.920
<v Speaker 1>and you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been rejected a lot of times,</v>

1658
01:10:30.921 --> 01:10:33.320
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not going to take no for an</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer and going to pound the pavement</v>

1659
01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:35.060
<v Speaker 1>and where to find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'll self publish at my,</v>

1660
01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:35.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll,</v>

1661
01:10:35.841 --> 01:10:37.510
<v Speaker 1>and I'll walk around and I'll go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>libraries.</v>

1662
01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:38.170
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll,</v>

1663
01:10:38.170 --> 01:10:40.610
<v Speaker 1>I'll get my book in libraries and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if they said all that,</v>

1664
01:10:40.611 --> 01:10:41.444
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

1665
01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Don't pay taxes.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1693
01:11:32.841 --> 01:11:36.830
<v Speaker 3>That was the craziest Ponzi scheme ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That you would have someone with an</v>

1694
01:11:36.831 --> 01:11:40.010
<v Speaker 3>adjustable rate mortgage and all of a</v>

1695
01:11:40.011 --> 01:11:41.870
<v Speaker 3>the roof and you're paying three times</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm paying 15,000.</v>

1699
01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:52.830

1700
01:11:52.831 --> 01:11:56.910
<v Speaker 2>fraud and garbage that was done from the</v>

1701
01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:59.670

<v Speaker 3>earlier about debt and about people with</v>

1718
01:12:35.470 --> 01:12:37.360
<v Speaker 3>credit card debt that they don't realize</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1719
01:12:37.361 --> 01:12:40.300
<v Speaker 3>And if you had money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I cash money and you wouldn't,</v>

1720
01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:43.330
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't be so likely to go into</v>
<v Speaker 3>debt with cash.</v>

1721
01:12:43.390 --> 01:12:45.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I think that's the same thing with</v>

1722
01:12:45.191 --> 01:12:48.190
<v Speaker 3>the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the environment is almost like</v>

1723
01:12:48.191 --> 01:12:52.150
<v Speaker 3>credit because it's like throwing</v>
<v Speaker 3>garbage out the window and no one's</v>

1724
01:12:52.151 --> 01:12:55.090
<v Speaker 3>thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're burning fossil fuels and fucking</v>

1725
01:12:55.091 --> 01:12:58.710
<v Speaker 3>spraying hairspray into this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's thinking about what that's</v>

1726
01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:02.050
<v Speaker 3>doing because we don't feel it instantly</v>
<v Speaker 3>and immediately.</v>

1727
01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:05.470
<v Speaker 3>We don't have like a vault.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We open up shit.</v>

1728
01:13:05.471 --> 01:13:07.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm out of air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1729
01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:10.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm running low</v>
<v Speaker 3>on fish left.</v>

1730
01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:12.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't feel it.</v>

1731
01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:16.270
<v Speaker 3>So we continue to act in the exact same</v>
<v Speaker 3>way because we're not really getting the</v>

1732
01:13:16.271 --> 01:13:17.290
<v Speaker 3>feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1733
01:13:17.291 --> 01:13:18.880
<v Speaker 3>you watch an inconvenient truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You went,</v>

1734
01:13:18.881 --> 01:13:20.110
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's Kinda fucked up.</v>

1735
01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:21.640
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get to work in the morning,</v>

1736
01:13:21.641 --> 01:13:22.600
<v Speaker 3>click,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shut it off,</v>

1737
01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:26.010
<v Speaker 3>go to bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She abb up,</v>

1738
01:13:26.050 --> 01:13:27.310
<v Speaker 3>wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep going.</v>

1739
01:13:27.370 --> 01:13:31.570
<v Speaker 3>And that's a pattern that just kept,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keeps getting repeated and repeated and</v>

1740
01:13:31.571 --> 01:13:34.510
<v Speaker 3>we're not feeling the feedback of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>negative actions.</v>

1741
01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:37.900
<v Speaker 2>I was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was flying and it was during that</v>

1742
01:13:37.901 --> 01:13:42.760
<v Speaker 2>crazy winter with a polar vortex stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it was like negative two degrees</v>

1743
01:13:42.761 --> 01:13:45.550
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of places and it got down to</v>
<v Speaker 2>like negative 20 in the Midwest.</v>

1744
01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:47.200
<v Speaker 2>What year was that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two years ago.</v>

1745
01:13:47.201 --> 01:13:48.430
<v Speaker 2>I think two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three years ago,</v>

1746
01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:49.930
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It was terrible.</v>

1749
01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:55.840
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1751
01:13:56.471 --> 01:13:58.240
<v Speaker 2>I got woken up by the bells of the ice</v>
<v Speaker 2>cream truck.</v>

1752
01:13:58.241 --> 01:14:00.520
<v Speaker 2>It was really a difficult winter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

1753
01:14:01.010 --> 01:14:02.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so I'm,</v>

1754
01:14:02.231 --> 01:14:03.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm flying somewhere and there's this</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>

<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

1758
01:14:09.010 --> 01:14:12.190
<v Speaker 2>And Tsa got a cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it one of these small</v>

1759
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:14.830
<v Speaker 1>airports where they all went to high</v>
<v Speaker 1>school together and uh,</v>

1760
01:14:14.831 --> 01:14:18.750
<v Speaker 1>and the guy goes so much for global</v>
<v Speaker 1>warming and I,</v>

1761
01:14:19.090 --> 01:14:22.090
<v Speaker 1>I need to leave well enough alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to learn how to do that.</v>

1762
01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:23.680
<v Speaker 1>But I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1763
01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:24.191
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

1764
01:14:24.191 --> 01:14:25.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>global warming also makes it colder in</v>

1765
01:14:25.841 --> 01:14:26.870
<v Speaker 1>the winter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Jews,</v>

1766
01:14:30.490 --> 01:14:33.100
<v Speaker 1>he knew right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1767
01:14:33.101 --> 01:14:33.791
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>

1768
01:14:33.791 --> 01:14:35.500
<v Speaker 1>immediately he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just what he,</v>

1769
01:14:35.530 --> 01:14:37.900
<v Speaker 1>his reaction actually was one of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>favorite things anyone's ever said.</v>

1770
01:14:37.901 --> 01:14:39.880
<v Speaker 1>He just goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they want you to believe.</v>

1771
01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:42.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they do because they're scientists</v>

1772
01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:43.840
<v Speaker 1>and they want you to believe them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1773
01:14:43.870 --> 01:14:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Sam Harris was talking about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday that trump is a global warming</v>

1774
01:14:47.651 --> 01:14:48.550
<v Speaker 1>denier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1775
01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:53.230
<v Speaker 1>Global warming denier is really close to</v>
<v Speaker 1>being the president of United States.</v>

1776
01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:55.630
<v Speaker 1>He's not only is he global warming</v>
<v Speaker 1>denier,</v>

1777
01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:58.660
<v Speaker 1>but the good news is if he felt he would</v>
<v Speaker 1>make money off of it,</v>

1778
01:14:58.661 --> 01:14:59.800
<v Speaker 1>he would believe in global warming.</v>

1779
01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:01.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

1780
01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:02.940
<v Speaker 1>There's no platform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't believe him.</v>

1781
01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:04.690
<v Speaker 1>Wonder what the thought process behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is.</v>

1782
01:15:04.691 --> 01:15:08.290
<v Speaker 1>Just plow straight ahead and just do</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever's good for you and don't give a</v>

1783
01:15:08.291 --> 01:15:11.550
<v Speaker 1>fuck or is there like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's narcissism tists.</v>

1784
01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:12.630
<v Speaker 1>We'll figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1785
01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:13.570
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1786
01:15:13.570 --> 01:15:15.130
<v Speaker 1>That's really what it was answered my</v>
<v Speaker 1>own question.</v>

1787
01:15:15.370 --> 01:15:17.080
<v Speaker 1>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's A.</v>

1788
01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:18.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what you were saying.</v>

1789
01:15:18.191 --> 01:15:23.191
<v Speaker 1>The idea of like planning ahead and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>know like I have this thing where it</v>

1790
01:15:23.410 --> 01:15:26.860
<v Speaker 1>bothers me when someone's unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Jane,</v>

1791
01:15:26.890 --> 01:15:29.710
<v Speaker 1>when I can see on happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether someone's mad at me about</v>

1792
01:15:29.711 --> 01:15:32.860
<v Speaker 1>something I did or just someone's sad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like immediately I'm like,</v>

1793
01:15:32.861 --> 01:15:34.030
<v Speaker 1>I have to fix this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1794
01:15:34.031 --> 01:15:35.680
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that's from,</v>

1795
01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:40.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how I got that way and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to get over it to a degree.</v>

1796
01:15:40.510 --> 01:15:43.870
<v Speaker 1>I like being compassionate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also don't want it to like totally</v>

1797
01:15:43.871 --> 01:15:47.960
<v Speaker 1>ruined me and I think that there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are wired and completely the</v>

1798
01:15:47.961 --> 01:15:52.270
<v Speaker 1>other direction who they can walk by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone bleeding to death and just be</v>

1799
01:15:52.271 --> 01:15:52.990
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ugh.</v>

1800
01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:55.990
<v Speaker 1>The sidewalk used to be so much nicer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1801
01:15:56.680 --> 01:16:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's probably like the type of</v>

1802
01:16:00.851 --> 01:16:04.000
<v Speaker 1>person that you don't want an office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1803
01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:06.700
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the exact type of person you</v>

1804
01:16:06.701 --> 01:16:08.710
<v Speaker 1>don't put no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also don't want the type of</v>

1805
01:16:08.711 --> 01:16:11.920
<v Speaker 1>person in the office is constantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>worried about people being sad because</v>

1806
01:16:11.921 --> 01:16:15.220
<v Speaker 1>then you'll never get anything done</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's 300 million people and at</v>

1807
01:16:15.221 --> 01:16:17.320
<v Speaker 1>least 30 million of them are satisfied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

1808
01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:19.150
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The least.</v>

1809
01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:22.540
<v Speaker 1>I can look at statistics being sad all</v>
<v Speaker 1>day with no problem.</v>

1810
01:16:22.810 --> 01:16:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistics don't fuck with you.</v>

1811
01:16:24.191 --> 01:16:25.490
<v Speaker 1>It's actually humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1812
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:27.910
<v Speaker 1>it's the interaction with humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about puppies?</v>

1813
01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:30.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big dog rescue guy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>But thankfully it to end,</v>

1832
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.580
<v Speaker 2>he comes out and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been looking for him and I just go</v>

1833
01:17:16.670 --> 01:17:20.870
<v Speaker 2>where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can a shit.</v>

1834
01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:22.700
<v Speaker 2>Where's the dog?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1835
01:17:22.701 --> 01:17:27.080
<v Speaker 2>the third one was one who was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think she's ever been owned.</v>

1836
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:30.590
<v Speaker 2>It was just on the streets of Louisville</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just walking around near the airport</v>

1837
01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:34.580
<v Speaker 2>and then the fourth one was actually one</v>
<v Speaker 2>where this was the one that made me the</v>

1838
01:17:34.581 --> 01:17:38.840
<v Speaker 2>most upset because leash and collar</v>
<v Speaker 2>right outside of a dog grooming place.</v>

1839
01:17:38.841 --> 01:17:39.561
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit.</v>

1840
01:17:39.561 --> 01:17:43.070
<v Speaker 2>One got out and so this is in Phoenix</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm running around.</v>

1841
01:17:43.071 --> 01:17:46.730
<v Speaker 2>It's 95 degree heat and this dog is fast</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like running around trying to</v>

1842
01:17:46.731 --> 01:17:50.300
<v Speaker 2>chase it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And finally there's this alcove in the</v>

1843
01:17:50.301 --> 01:17:52.220
<v Speaker 2>shopping center where it goes in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>alcove and I'm like,</v>

1844
01:17:52.221 --> 01:17:53.150
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll be cornered.</v>

1845
01:17:53.210 --> 01:17:54.380
<v Speaker 2>I'll finally be able to get it.</v>

1846
01:17:54.650 --> 01:17:57.500
<v Speaker 2>And so I go in there and there's like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman with a stroller and I go,</v>

1847
01:17:57.501 --> 01:17:59.180
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you see a stray dog run by here?</v>

1848
01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:00.800
<v Speaker 2>And then I see the dog in the corner and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1849
01:18:00.830 --> 01:18:01.730
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's right there.</v>

1850
01:18:01.970 --> 01:18:04.520
<v Speaker 2>And she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my dog because that's your dog.</v>

1851
01:18:04.521 --> 01:18:06.680
<v Speaker 2>I've been chasing it for 20 minutes</v>
<v Speaker 2>through a parking lot.</v>

1852
01:18:06.710 --> 01:18:08.390
<v Speaker 2>It almost got hit by three different</v>
<v Speaker 2>cars.</v>

1853
01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:09.440
<v Speaker 2>And she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1854
01:18:09.441 --> 01:18:11.420
<v Speaker 2>did it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1855
01:18:11.421 --> 01:18:13.220
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens when dogs run around</v>

1856
01:18:13.221 --> 01:18:14.930
<v Speaker 2>parking lots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When people have strollers,</v>

1857
01:18:14.931 --> 01:18:17.750
<v Speaker 2>they don't give a fuck about their dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm concerned,</v>

1858
01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:21.020
<v Speaker 2>concerned with this little baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this dog and go fuck itself.</v>

1859
01:18:21.290 --> 01:18:23.660
<v Speaker 2>I just think like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how hard is it to take that leash and</v>

1860
01:18:23.661 --> 01:18:26.040
<v Speaker 2>just tie it to the bench that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting on it.</v>

1861
01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:29.120
<v Speaker 2>It's hard for some people just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to not hold the baby over the</v>

1862
01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:31.170
<v Speaker 2>grill enclosure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very difficult.</v>

1863
01:18:31.190 --> 01:18:35.180
<v Speaker 2>So that compels soon is real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The struggle is real.</v>

1864
01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:36.980
<v Speaker 2>Be Like I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1865
01:18:36.981 --> 01:18:38.630
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't want to let this dog go.</v>

1866
01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:40.750
<v Speaker 3>What am I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my favorite dogs ever.</v>

1867
01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:45.530
<v Speaker 3>I got a call from these people that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>knew they were a dog watchers and uh,</v>

1868
01:18:45.550 --> 01:18:48.940
<v Speaker 3>they found a dog in their neighborhood</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they knew that I had dogs and the</v>

<v Speaker 3>She was really sick and they were like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>we don't even know if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if she's going to be able to make it</v>

<v Speaker 3>It was so sad and so they had washed her</v>

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1916
01:20:55.890 --> 01:20:56.940
<v Speaker 2>shelters are tough.</v>

1917
01:20:57.130 --> 01:20:58.600
<v Speaker 3>It's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's tough to go there.</v>

1918
01:20:58.601 --> 01:21:02.260
<v Speaker 3>It's tough to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just the people are so</v>

1919
01:21:02.261 --> 01:21:05.230
<v Speaker 3>irresponsible there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So irresponsible with pads they get and</v>

1920
01:21:05.231 --> 01:21:07.270
<v Speaker 3>we can't have this dog dog shit in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

1921
01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:10.690
<v Speaker 3>Like you got to teach them to not shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the house next to just give them up</v>

1922
01:21:10.691 --> 01:21:12.430
<v Speaker 3>and leave him in a cage and out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>sight,</v>

1923
01:21:12.431 --> 01:21:14.320
<v Speaker 3>out of mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go on with their life.</v>

1924
01:21:14.650 --> 01:21:17.990
<v Speaker 3>What disturbed me is when I found out</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many animals Peta kills everything</v>

1925
01:21:18.050 --> 01:21:19.410
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1926
01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:22.260
<v Speaker 2>I got into it with the pita.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A spokesperson on twitter.</v>

1927
01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:23.340
<v Speaker 2>Did you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

1929
01:21:24.450 --> 01:21:28.470
<v Speaker 2>I was pretty happy with those at about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she followed me on twitter and I just</v>

1930
01:21:28.471 --> 01:21:29.520
<v Speaker 2>write back and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so honored for the follow sincere</v>

1932
01:21:31.890 --> 01:21:33.510
<v Speaker 2>the Peta spokesperson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1933
01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:36.150
<v Speaker 2>could you let me know why Peter has a 90</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent kill rate?</v>

1934
01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:38.850
<v Speaker 2>And so she starts doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1935
01:21:38.851 --> 01:21:40.560
<v Speaker 2>the standard pr thing of like,</v>

1937
01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:44.460

<v Speaker 2>don't really have much of a chance</v>

1938
01:21:44.461 --> 01:21:45.870
<v Speaker 2>elsewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1939
01:21:45.871 --> 01:21:47.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're kind of a last resort.</v>

1940
01:21:47.550 --> 01:21:48.540
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1942
01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:52.740

<v Speaker 2>of shelters that are like that and their</v>

1943
01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:56.180
<v Speaker 2>kill rate is one 10th of yours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you could explain it.</v>

1944
01:21:56.190 --> 01:21:59.220
<v Speaker 2>And I just kept hammering her about and</v>
<v Speaker 2>hammered her about it and hammer</v>

1945
01:21:59.221 --> 01:22:00.400
<v Speaker 2>lightly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1946
01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:02.280
<v Speaker 2>calmly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't like,</v>

1947
01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:04.590
<v Speaker 2>shut up bitch like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that gets you nowhere,</v>

1948
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:06.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just trying to outwit her and it</v>

1949
01:22:06.661 --> 01:22:07.950
<v Speaker 2>was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a lot of fun.</v>

1950
01:22:07.951 --> 01:22:09.150
<v Speaker 2>And eventually then she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1951
01:22:09.151 --> 01:22:10.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't speak for Peta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1952
01:22:10.591 --> 01:22:11.550
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your bio,</v>

1953
01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:14.760
<v Speaker 2>on your twitter it says head of</v>
<v Speaker 2>communications.</v>

1954
01:22:15.150 --> 01:22:16.680
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1955
01:22:16.830 --> 01:22:18.990
<v Speaker 2>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now you're speaking to me.</v>

1956
01:22:19.420 --> 01:22:23.030
<v Speaker 3>Is it a resource issue as PD does not</v>
<v Speaker 3>have the money to take Carolyn?</v>

1957
01:22:23.190 --> 01:22:25.980
<v Speaker 2>It's actually a batman issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1958
01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:28.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how like ratio goal pause.</v>

1959
01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:30.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1960
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:33.250
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the idea of like in a,</v>

1961
01:22:33.270 --> 01:22:38.150
<v Speaker 2>in the first Christian Bale Batman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a racial goal was kind of like who's</v>

1962
01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:38.911
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1963
01:22:38.911 --> 01:22:41.070
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bad guy in Bama and they were like,</v>

1964
01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:43.080
<v Speaker 2>we need to save the city by destroying</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1965
01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:44.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the humans are destroying</v>

1966
01:22:44.641 --> 01:22:47.190
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to wipe this out and,</v>

1967
01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:50.730
<v Speaker 2>and so that'll prevent the problem and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is.</v>

1968
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.870
<v Speaker 2>Peta is basically like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a problem with like,</v>

1969
01:22:54.871 --> 01:22:58.620
<v Speaker 2>we love these dogs and so to stop them</v>
<v Speaker 2>from overbreeding we're just going to</v>

1970
01:22:58.621 --> 01:23:01.320
<v Speaker 2>murder a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's where they go with it.</v>

1971
01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:06.310
<v Speaker 2>We'll see the head of Peta when you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the top crazy person,</v>

1972
01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:07.091
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1973
01:23:07.091 --> 01:23:09.000
<v Speaker 3>it's not murdered for saying this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1974
01:23:09.010 --> 01:23:10.510
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they do,</v>

1975
01:23:10.511 --> 01:23:14.320
<v Speaker 3>they're rude animal liberation</v>
<v Speaker 3>organization.</v>

1976
01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:14.890
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1977
01:23:14.890 --> 01:23:17.890
<v Speaker 3>the real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the at the very head of a lot of these</v>

1978
01:23:17.891 --> 01:23:20.800
<v Speaker 3>really radical animal rights movements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>

1979
01:23:20.801 --> 01:23:25.801
<v Speaker 3>I love animals so I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get the wanting pets to be taken care</v>

1980
01:23:27.281 --> 01:23:28.930
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't want pets to be taken</v>

1981
01:23:28.931 --> 01:23:30.280
<v Speaker 3>care of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want pets.</v>

1982
01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:33.310
<v Speaker 3>They think animals should be free,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all animals should be free.</v>

1983
01:23:33.311 --> 01:23:35.440
<v Speaker 3>All livestock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all pets,</v>

1984
01:23:35.770 --> 01:23:37.510
<v Speaker 3>none of that should be real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All animals.</v>

1985
01:23:37.511 --> 01:23:39.730
<v Speaker 3>She just existed in some sort of a wild</v>
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>

1986
01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:41.340
<v Speaker 3>They also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1987
01:23:41.870 --> 01:23:45.510
<v Speaker 3>she's gone on the record many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many times talking about how people</v>

1988
01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.060
<v Speaker 3>should be eradicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1989
01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:48.120
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1990
01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:51.820
<v Speaker 3>and like things like that and the idea</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they are dangerous.</v>

1991
01:23:51.850 --> 01:23:53.890
<v Speaker 3>I've had them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just are,</v>

1992
01:23:54.220 --> 01:23:56.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are thousands of years of breeding</v>

1993
01:23:56.561 --> 01:23:58.900
<v Speaker 3>to fight each other and if you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>irresponsible,</v>

1994
01:23:58.901 --> 01:24:01.390
<v Speaker 3>dog owner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pitbulls can be fucking dangerous.</v>

1995
01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:02.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time,</v>

1996
01:24:02.351 --> 01:24:04.570
<v Speaker 3>they say that about my dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about my staffy.</v>

1997
01:24:04.690 --> 01:24:06.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But staffordshires terrorists.</v>

1998
01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:08.470
<v Speaker 3>That's ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not the same breed.</v>

1999
01:24:08.650 --> 01:24:10.300
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a genetic according to law.</v>

2000
01:24:10.301 --> 01:24:11.540
<v Speaker 3>They are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2001
01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:13.690
<v Speaker 3>but that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not right.</v>

2002
01:24:14.010 --> 01:24:16.150
<v Speaker 3>The law is incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just some stuff written down on</v>

2003
01:24:16.151 --> 01:24:19.120
<v Speaker 3>paper when you deal with the actual</v>
<v Speaker 3>genetic lines of the dog.</v>

2004
01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:21.150
<v Speaker 3>I've had dogs that were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

2005
01:24:21.151 --> 01:24:24.130
<v Speaker 3>were there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The line was from fighting dogs and they</v>

2006
01:24:24.131 --> 01:24:26.770
<v Speaker 3>were impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't take them to the dog park,</v>

2007
01:24:26.771 --> 01:24:28.480
<v Speaker 3>couldn't take them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't matter how much I trained</v>

2008
01:24:28.481 --> 01:24:29.380
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they much how I,</v>

2009
01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:33.220
<v Speaker 3>how much I was with them all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When dogs had blow up around them,</v>

2010
01:24:33.250 --> 01:24:35.820
<v Speaker 3>he would get aggressive and he want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight while night.</v>

2011
01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:37.960
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you on a lot of things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is.</v>

2012
01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:41.940
<v Speaker 3>This is one where where I have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely different line because like I</v>

2013
01:24:41.941 --> 01:24:46.941
<v Speaker 3>have a dog who is Chihuahua Basset Hound</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I can't bring her nero that dogs,</v>

2014
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:48.880
<v Speaker 3>but that's an exception to the rule.</v>

2015
01:24:48.980 --> 01:24:53.330
<v Speaker 3>Pit Bulls are kind of the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem with pitbulls is if you get.</v>

2016
01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:56.050
<v Speaker 3>It's a very dangerous dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're super powerful.</v>

2017
01:24:56.051 --> 01:24:57.880
<v Speaker 3>They're really aggressive and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>

2018
01:24:58.180 --> 01:25:02.680
<v Speaker 3>They don't respond to pain the way a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of other dogs do because it's been bred</v>

2019
01:25:02.681 --> 01:25:05.590
<v Speaker 3>out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you follow the way they breed</v>

2020
01:25:05.591 --> 01:25:08.080
<v Speaker 3>dogs for fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When dogs fight,</v>

2021
01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:10.690
<v Speaker 3>if they back away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they cower,</v>

2022
01:25:10.810 --> 01:25:13.440
<v Speaker 3>they were killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the whole Michael Vick thing is</v>

2023
01:25:13.470 --> 01:25:16.630
<v Speaker 3>that it killed all these dogs that quit</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fights.</v>

2024
01:25:16.810 --> 01:25:21.810
<v Speaker 3>So when you have all of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>reinforcement genetically and you're</v>

2025
01:25:22.481 --> 01:25:27.280
<v Speaker 3>dealing with a breed that's been raised</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this for hundreds and hundreds of</v>

2026
01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:30.640
<v Speaker 3>generations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with an incredibly</v>

2027
01:25:30.641 --> 01:25:34.150
<v Speaker 3>aggressive draw a dog with a really high</v>
<v Speaker 3>kill drive.</v>

2028
01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:39.070
<v Speaker 3>And when these dogs with high prey drive</v>
<v Speaker 3>or given to irresponsible people,</v>

2029
01:25:39.250 --> 01:25:41.500
<v Speaker 3>that's when you're getting all babies</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting killed.</v>

2030
01:25:41.501 --> 01:25:43.810
<v Speaker 3>Little kids getting killed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting killed.</v>

2031
01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:48.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean it is breed specific,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean that's also the same train of</v>

2032
01:25:48.701 --> 01:25:49.840
<v Speaker 3>thought that people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2033
01:25:49.841 --> 01:25:51.790
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can put on a powdered wig and say</v>

2034
01:25:51.791 --> 01:25:55.720
<v Speaker 3>that about quote unquote the Negro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No you couldn't because they weren't</v>

2035
01:25:55.721 --> 01:25:59.350
<v Speaker 3>bred for fighting and killing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you bred a bunch of people just for</v>

2036
01:25:59.351 --> 01:26:00.700
<v Speaker 3>fighting and killing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2037
01:26:00.701 --> 01:26:04.430
<v Speaker 3>you can make that distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But pit bulls bred for fighting.</v>

2038
01:26:04.730 --> 01:26:07.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they were bred for.</v>

2039
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:09.800
<v Speaker 1>That's why they look that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2040
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:12.500
<v Speaker 1>this is a thing that's been recent</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

2041
01:26:12.530 --> 01:26:14.350
<v Speaker 1>They used to be used in hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>generations.</v>

2042
01:26:14.351 --> 01:26:16.310
<v Speaker 1>It's not that recent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they used to be,</v>

2043
01:26:16.311 --> 01:26:18.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the PIPA was America sweetheart.</v>

2044
01:26:18.310 --> 01:26:20.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2045
01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.670
<v Speaker 1>The PD from the little rascals had the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pip,</v>

2046
01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:23.533
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was,</v>

2047
01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:26.570
<v Speaker 1>but the was almost America's mascot by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>

2048
01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:28.070
<v Speaker 1>Before the Eagle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2049
01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:31.310
<v Speaker 1>The eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the problem is also is that</v>

2050
01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:35.270
<v Speaker 1>if a dog looks like a pitfall because</v>
<v Speaker 1>people actually isn't even a breed.</v>

2051
01:26:35.271 --> 01:26:36.590
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it,</v>

2052
01:26:36.591 --> 01:26:40.820
<v Speaker 1>American something terrier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm is the actual breed that people are</v>

2053
01:26:40.821 --> 01:26:41.481
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2054
01:26:41.481 --> 01:26:44.990
<v Speaker 1>it was an American bulldog mixed with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrier.</v>

2055
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:48.440
<v Speaker 1>Terriers are more aggressive and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they made the new breed.</v>

2056
01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:49.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then.</v>

2057
01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:53.150
<v Speaker 1>But if you get a blood line from one</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a fighting dog,</v>

2058
01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:55.610
<v Speaker 1>and this is not someone I'd love</v>
<v Speaker 1>pitbulls.</v>

2059
01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:57.260
<v Speaker 1>I have friends that have pit bull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love them.</v>

2060
01:26:57.261 --> 01:26:59.450
<v Speaker 1>They're the sweetest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most friendly dog,</v>

2061
01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:02.570
<v Speaker 1>but if handled correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still have a problem being</v>

2062
01:27:02.571 --> 01:27:05.060
<v Speaker 1>aggressive with other dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them do.</v>

2063
01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:07.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're really powerful dogs and in</v>

2064
01:27:07.941 --> 01:27:09.630
<v Speaker 1>the hands of the wrong people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

2065
01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:11.660
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking about labs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2066
01:27:11.930 --> 01:27:14.990
<v Speaker 1>We have a lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Labs are like universally loving and</v>

2067
01:27:14.991 --> 01:27:17.090
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get the exception to the rule.</v>

2068
01:27:17.091 --> 01:27:20.900
<v Speaker 1>You get a bad lab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but overall Labrador retrievers are</v>

2069
01:27:20.901 --> 01:27:23.120
<v Speaker 1>really friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy going dogs,</v>

2070
01:27:23.390 --> 01:27:25.220
<v Speaker 1>so when someone has a lab you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2071
01:27:25.221 --> 01:27:27.140
<v Speaker 1>he's got a lap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When someone has a pit bull,</v>

2072
01:27:27.170 --> 01:27:29.300
<v Speaker 1>there's a fucking reason why people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh great.</v>

2073
01:27:29.301 --> 01:27:32.720
<v Speaker 1>He's got a pit bull because a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them are fucking crazy a lot.</v>

2074
01:27:32.810 --> 01:27:37.070
<v Speaker 1>Well there and I think it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it boils down to who is handling</v>

2075
01:27:37.071 --> 01:27:39.710
<v Speaker 1>the dog and the idea of if you.</v>

2076
01:27:40.210 --> 01:27:42.050
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate when someone is like,</v>

2077
01:27:42.051 --> 01:27:43.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking of getting a pimple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2078
01:27:43.491 --> 01:27:45.770
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either you need to know everything about</v>

2079
01:27:45.771 --> 01:27:48.090
<v Speaker 1>it and then you get one or you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2080
01:27:48.091 --> 01:27:50.600
<v Speaker 1>You have to have a yard that contained</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dog for sure.</v>

2081
01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:53.140
<v Speaker 1>You have to be on top of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to training,</v>

2082
01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:55.820
<v Speaker 1>you have to really be aware.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to read books on it.</v>

2083
01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:58.910
<v Speaker 1>You should probably seek help with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>professional,</v>

2084
01:27:58.911 --> 01:28:02.090
<v Speaker 1>the behavioral specialist with dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even then,</v>

2085
01:28:02.330 --> 01:28:05.240
<v Speaker 1>if some dog threatens your dog or</v>
<v Speaker 1>grounds or on your dog,</v>

2086
01:28:05.241 --> 01:28:08.000
<v Speaker 1>it's likely that your dog's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>clamp ahold of it's neck.</v>

2087
01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:11.780
<v Speaker 1>That dog's going to get fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's also why I'm a huge proponent</v>

2088
01:28:11.781 --> 01:28:13.220
<v Speaker 1>of leash laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think by the way,</v>

2089
01:28:13.221 --> 01:28:18.200
<v Speaker 1>if la fuck these parking tickets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leash laws like you and you enforce</v>

2090
01:28:18.201 --> 01:28:21.470
<v Speaker 1>leash laws and we will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will have more money than any city in</v>

2091
01:28:21.471 --> 01:28:22.040
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

2092
01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:22.873
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2093
01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:25.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess how many people really walk</v>

2094
01:28:25.911 --> 01:28:28.250
<v Speaker 1>around with your dog without a leash?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that really a problem?</v>

2095
01:28:28.340 --> 01:28:29.480
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't.</v>

2096
01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:33.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I've ever walked my dog</v>
<v Speaker 1>without running into someone who had an</v>

2097
01:28:33.021 --> 01:28:34.580
<v Speaker 1>off leash dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2098
01:28:34.610 --> 01:28:37.100
<v Speaker 1>that's irresponsible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's turn on a trail or something like</v>

2099
01:28:37.101 --> 01:28:37.650
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

2100
01:28:37.650 --> 01:28:41.300
<v Speaker 1>but even then I had a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was walking my dogs on this trail</v>

2101
01:28:41.301 --> 01:28:45.470
<v Speaker 1>on a leash park in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was fryman and uh,</v>

2102
01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:48.540
<v Speaker 1>these two huge dogs come bounding at us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2103
01:28:48.830 --> 01:28:51.260
<v Speaker 1>And now look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they playful.</v>

2104
01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:54.530
<v Speaker 1>One of mine's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of mine is fucking terror when it</v>

2105
01:28:54.531 --> 01:28:57.170
<v Speaker 1>comes to other dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so immediately we pick them up and</v>

2106
01:28:57.171 --> 01:29:00.370
<v Speaker 1>this lady starts lecturing us about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not socializing your dog's</v>

2107
01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:01.980
<v Speaker 1>correctly and they'll never learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

2108
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:02.640
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2109
01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:05.580
<v Speaker 2>if you want my dog to bite your dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can put her back down if you'd like.</v>

2110
01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:08.280
<v Speaker 2>But like that's why learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2111
01:29:08.490 --> 01:29:10.530
<v Speaker 2>People who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whose lives are a mess.</v>

2112
01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:12.270
<v Speaker 2>Always love correcting people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2113
01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:16.000
<v Speaker 2>I called to get your shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call it a incorrect,</v>

2114
01:29:16.460 --> 01:29:17.160
<v Speaker 2>incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2115
01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:19.100
<v Speaker 2>thanks for correcting me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2116
01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:20.880
<v Speaker 2>You need to socialize your dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

2117
01:29:20.881 --> 01:29:22.710
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little dog that you can pick up</v>

2118
01:29:22.711 --> 01:29:25.830
<v Speaker 2>and big dogs running around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably should pick them up.</v>

2119
01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:28.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dogs like to bite little dogs.</v>

2120
01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:29.490
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do it all the time.</v>

2121
01:29:29.550 --> 01:29:31.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It still looks like a raw,</v>

2122
01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:33.930
<v Speaker 2>especially if it's the wrong kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>dog,</v>

2123
01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:35.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like huskies,</v>

2124
01:29:35.170 --> 01:29:36.760
<v Speaker 2>all skeezer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Akitas,</v>

2125
01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:38.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like real aggressive dogs.</v>

2126
01:29:38.270 --> 01:29:40.140
<v Speaker 2>There are so many people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was one in my,</v>

2127
01:29:40.141 --> 01:29:41.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my old neighborhood.</v>

2128
01:29:41.221 --> 01:29:44.490
<v Speaker 2>We're walking our dogs and all of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sudden his dog comes charging at us and</v>

2129
01:29:44.491 --> 01:29:45.390
<v Speaker 2>it was like a little dog.</v>

2130
01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:49.620
<v Speaker 2>And so we pick our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our dogs and my wife feels lease your</v>

2131
01:29:49.621 --> 01:29:51.870
<v Speaker 2>damn dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the guy goes,</v>

2132
01:29:51.871 --> 01:29:54.090
<v Speaker 2>this is a public space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>

2133
01:29:54.150 --> 01:29:56.670
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why you lease your dunk.</v>

2134
01:29:56.730 --> 01:29:59.820
<v Speaker 2>But where was this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a little lawn of an apartment</v>

2135
01:29:59.821 --> 01:30:00.940
<v Speaker 2>complex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2136
01:30:01.010 --> 01:30:02.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just a,</v>

2137
01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:03.980
<v Speaker 2>just a place where people walk the dogs</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

2138
01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:06.630
<v Speaker 2>Do you believe unleashing your dogs on</v>
<v Speaker 2>trails and stuff too?</v>

2139
01:30:06.631 --> 01:30:08.660
<v Speaker 2>Like when you're in parks and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2140
01:30:08.670 --> 01:30:11.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean if it is a non unleashed place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that's fine.</v>

2141
01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:13.440
<v Speaker 2>If it's at least place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is,</v>

2142
01:30:13.441 --> 01:30:16.980
<v Speaker 2>is that if someone's dog's leash and</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's dog isn't leashed that's a bad</v>

2143
01:30:16.981 --> 01:30:20.480
<v Speaker 2>way for them to me because one dog feels</v>
<v Speaker 2>trapped and.</v>

2144
01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:22.230
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's about expectation.</v>

2145
01:30:22.290 --> 01:30:25.110
<v Speaker 2>So if I know that they're gonna be non</v>
<v Speaker 2>leashed dogs there,</v>

2146
01:30:25.111 --> 01:30:27.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine because I know I'm prepared and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready,</v>

2147
01:30:27.391 --> 01:30:28.021
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

2148
01:30:28.021 --> 01:30:29.730
<v Speaker 2>and the dog's prepared and et Cetera.</v>

2149
01:30:29.970 --> 01:30:32.370
<v Speaker 2>But if like all of a sudden the dog just</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes out of the woods,</v>

2150
01:30:33.010 --> 01:30:33.860
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not,</v>

2151
01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:35.970
<v Speaker 2>that's not safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2152
01:30:36.030 --> 01:30:37.830
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not robots,</v>

2153
01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:39.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>

2154
01:30:40.260 --> 01:30:42.270
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so much variety in the way dogs</v>

2155
01:30:42.271 --> 01:30:45.150
<v Speaker 2>behave and the way dogs treat other dogs</v>
<v Speaker 2>and other people.</v>

2156
01:30:45.151 --> 01:30:46.490
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always like,</v>

2157
01:30:46.530 --> 01:30:48.360
<v Speaker 2>what's this dog like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here comes the dog,</v>

2158
01:30:48.361 --> 01:30:49.650
<v Speaker 2>what are we dealing with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2159
01:30:49.651 --> 01:30:50.750
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2160
01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:52.890
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know that like even when I stopped</v>

2161
01:30:52.891 --> 01:30:55.170
<v Speaker 2>for them on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that's dangerous to do because</v>

2162
01:30:55.171 --> 01:30:58.170
<v Speaker 2>you have no idea if that dog is going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>like try to bite you.</v>

2163
01:30:58.200 --> 01:30:59.640
<v Speaker 2>But I've been bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't.</v>

2164
01:30:59.930 --> 01:31:00.751
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2165
01:31:00.751 --> 01:31:02.550
<v Speaker 2>I keep a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I keep a slip lead in the car.</v>

2166
01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:06.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm constantly keep an eye just have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>slowly to my trunk.</v>

2167
01:31:06.061 --> 01:31:08.820
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen so many of them and I can't</v>

2168
01:31:08.821 --> 01:31:12.000
<v Speaker 2>tell you how many times I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I had something to run this.</v>

2169
01:31:12.110 --> 01:31:14.070
<v Speaker 2>And when you capture them then when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>put them in your car,</v>

2170
01:31:14.071 --> 01:31:16.110
<v Speaker 2>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just bring them right to a shelter a</v>

2171
01:31:16.170 --> 01:31:19.920
<v Speaker 2>well so far I actually have not had that</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

2172
01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:23.550
<v Speaker 2>Usually it is either like one time there</v>
<v Speaker 2>was someone else there that happened to</v>

2173
01:31:23.551 --> 01:31:25.980
<v Speaker 2>work for rescue that also stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2174
01:31:25.981 --> 01:31:28.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one time there was a like a pet store</v>

2175
01:31:28.261 --> 01:31:30.150
<v Speaker 2>right nearby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I kinda like brought the dog into the</v>

2176
01:31:30.151 --> 01:31:33.000
<v Speaker 2>pet store and they were able to hold him</v>
<v Speaker 2>while a while.</v>

2177
01:31:33.050 --> 01:31:33.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the owner came,</v>

2178
01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:36.360
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I actually haven't,</v>

2179
01:31:36.361 --> 01:31:36.991
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

2180
01:31:36.991 --> 01:31:37.890
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one time,</v>

2181
01:31:37.891 --> 01:31:38.670
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I brought,</v>

2182
01:31:38.670 --> 01:31:40.950
<v Speaker 2>I brought a dog to in Louisville.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I brought a dog to a shelter.</v>

2183
01:31:41.550 --> 01:31:42.210
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one that,</v>

2184
01:31:42.210 --> 01:31:44.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this past week where like I put her in</v>

2185
01:31:44.311 --> 01:31:47.220
<v Speaker 2>the car and then I had to be super</v>
<v Speaker 2>careful and disinfect everything because</v>

2186
01:31:47.221 --> 01:31:48.360
<v Speaker 2>you never know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2187
01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:53.440
<v Speaker 2>dad's and I have a dog and so I just</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically I had my buddy who I had my</v>

2188
01:31:53.461 --> 01:31:56.280
<v Speaker 2>dog with me when I saw the other dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I had my buddy,</v>

2189
01:31:56.820 --> 01:31:59.830
<v Speaker 2>we were like half a mile from the hotel</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he just walked to the hotel with my</v>

2190
01:31:59.831 --> 01:32:00.220
<v Speaker 2>dog</v>

2191
01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:02.920
<v Speaker 1>and then I just drove the other dog to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shelter.</v>

2192
01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.170
<v Speaker 1>And then you just hope someone adopts</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2193
01:32:05.230 --> 01:32:06.700
<v Speaker 1>You just put it on social media and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>hope.</v>

2194
01:32:06.850 --> 01:32:08.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you pick up a dog that has fleas,</v>

2195
01:32:08.450 --> 01:32:10.210
<v Speaker 1>the fleas getting the carpet of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

2196
01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:11.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2197
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:14.560
<v Speaker 1>but that's the thing I've given up on</v>
<v Speaker 1>flea prevention really,</v>

2198
01:32:14.620 --> 01:32:16.840
<v Speaker 1>like it's something where I give my dogs</v>
<v Speaker 1>a medicine for it,</v>

2199
01:32:17.110 --> 01:32:20.530
<v Speaker 1>but like California has such a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>flea problem that there's nothing you</v>

2200
01:32:20.531 --> 01:32:22.510
<v Speaker 1>could do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like after a certain amount,</v>

2201
01:32:22.511 --> 01:32:24.700
<v Speaker 1>like every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every dog has fleas.</v>

2202
01:32:25.110 --> 01:32:26.440
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2203
01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:29.050
<v Speaker 1>it's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some react to it worse than others.</v>

2204
01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:30.700
<v Speaker 1>My dogs don't have fleas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is.</v>

2205
01:32:30.790 --> 01:32:32.470
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you live in a special place.</v>

2206
01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:37.270
<v Speaker 1>You live in a magical cloud above Los</v>
<v Speaker 1>Angeles.</v>

2207
01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:42.300
<v Speaker 1>Magical cloud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the to killing thing.</v>

2208
01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:48.850
<v Speaker 1>So they always fucks with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing to me that people will</v>

2209
01:32:48.851 --> 01:32:52.150
<v Speaker 1>justify it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also there's video of them going to a</v>

2210
01:32:52.151 --> 01:32:57.151
<v Speaker 1>porch and like leading someone's dog off</v>
<v Speaker 1>their porch and taking it and killing it</v>

2211
01:32:57.911 --> 01:32:59.100
<v Speaker 1>within a couple of hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2212
01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:01.690
<v Speaker 1>And why do they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did they lead it off the porch?</v>

2213
01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:03.310
<v Speaker 1>Again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to eradicate it.</v>

2214
01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:06.010
<v Speaker 1>They just don't want meds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just don't want pets.</v>

2215
01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:08.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's better to kill the pet</v>

2216
01:33:08.381 --> 01:33:12.040
<v Speaker 1>than allow the pet to be with the person</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they love to lead a life of</v>

2217
01:33:12.041 --> 01:33:16.360
<v Speaker 1>slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So bizarre to see that kind of radical</v>

2218
01:33:16.361 --> 01:33:17.620
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's just the case with</v>

2219
01:33:17.621 --> 01:33:18.221
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2220
01:33:18.221 --> 01:33:21.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have your reasonable people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you have your people that take</v>

2221
01:33:21.971 --> 01:33:24.760
<v Speaker 1>that to the utmost and take it to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>furthest,</v>

2222
01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:28.870
<v Speaker 1>furthest point of rational thinking to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point where you're like,</v>

2223
01:33:28.930 --> 01:33:30.220
<v Speaker 1>you're killing all the dogs.</v>

2224
01:33:30.220 --> 01:33:33.220
<v Speaker 1>You capture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorite things that I've seen</v>

2225
01:33:33.221 --> 01:33:37.540
<v Speaker 1>was A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Stewart showed a video of people</v>

2226
01:33:37.541 --> 01:33:40.420
<v Speaker 1>merging to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like the Holland tunnel</v>

2227
01:33:40.421 --> 01:33:43.060
<v Speaker 1>or the Lincoln tunnel or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was like one car,</v>

2228
01:33:43.061 --> 01:33:44.050
<v Speaker 1>one car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one car,</v>

2229
01:33:44.051 --> 01:33:45.640
<v Speaker 1>one car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one like you're supposed to do with</v>

2230
01:33:45.641 --> 01:33:47.770
<v Speaker 1>merge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And every now and then someone would</v>

2231
01:33:47.771 --> 01:33:51.340
<v Speaker 1>drive up on the shoulder and go around</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of them and just be like,</v>

2232
01:33:51.370 --> 01:33:52.780
<v Speaker 1>fuck everybody but me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2233
01:33:53.290 --> 01:33:58.290
<v Speaker 1>And that is who creates terrible policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is who shouts from the rooftops</v>

2234
01:33:59.231 --> 01:34:02.290
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that is who most of us will just</v>

2235
01:34:02.291 --> 01:34:03.370
<v Speaker 1>drive one car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one car.</v>

2236
01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:04.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And understand that that's what you do</v>

2237
01:34:04.991 --> 01:34:08.620
<v Speaker 1>because that's what you want to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one guy that's late for work every</v>

2238
01:34:08.620 --> 01:34:09.520
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2239
01:34:09.521 --> 01:34:11.170
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a guy do that the other day.</v>

2240
01:34:11.171 --> 01:34:14.710
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hit the breakdown lane near a light</v>

2241
01:34:14.750 --> 01:34:16.830
<v Speaker 1>light was about to turn green and he got</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the,</v>

2242
01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:20.230
<v Speaker 1>the side lane where people park and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>gunned it through the intersection.</v>

2243
01:34:20.230 --> 01:34:22.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost plowed into people.</v>

2244
01:34:22.121 --> 01:34:25.140
<v Speaker 1>And then you see him speeding up ahead</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was probably late for work</v>

2245
01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:27.070
<v Speaker 1>was early in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2246
01:34:27.071 --> 01:34:31.030
<v Speaker 1>there's so many people that everyday</v>
<v Speaker 1>they barely make it to work on time and</v>

2247
01:34:31.031 --> 01:34:32.800
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like this adrenaline rush.</v>

2248
01:34:32.801 --> 01:34:34.930
<v Speaker 1>They're addicted to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't even realize it.</v>

2249
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:36.500
<v Speaker 1>They're supposed to leave at seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>

2250
01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:37.870
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifteen,</v>

2251
01:34:37.871 --> 01:34:38.620
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

2252
01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:39.191
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

2253
01:34:39.191 --> 01:34:39.730
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

2254
01:34:39.730 --> 01:34:41.650
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they run out the door and it's,</v>

2255
01:34:41.651 --> 01:34:43.090
<v Speaker 1>that's the race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

2256
01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:44.530
<v Speaker 1>that's where they're getting their</v>
<v Speaker 1>chart.</v>

2257
01:34:44.531 --> 01:34:46.300
<v Speaker 1>They're not getting chased by saber</v>
<v Speaker 1>tooth tigers,</v>

2258
01:34:46.301 --> 01:34:49.540
<v Speaker 1>but they are getting their adrenaline</v>
<v Speaker 1>fix because that's the danger.</v>

2259
01:34:49.620 --> 01:34:51.010
<v Speaker 1>Another thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2260
01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:53.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that another Chris Bauer story,</v>

2261
01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:56.950
<v Speaker 1>another comic was asking him about</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he drives around and gigs all</v>

2262
01:34:56.951 --> 01:34:58.100
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And someone asked</v>

2263
01:34:58.100 --> 01:34:59.300
<v Speaker 2>him about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he said,</v>

2264
01:34:59.330 --> 01:35:00.260
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never speed.</v>

2265
01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:01.733
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>

2266
01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.830
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean you never speed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you get there?</v>

2267
01:35:03.831 --> 01:35:07.340
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'm in my forties now so I wake up</v>

2268
01:35:07.341 --> 01:35:12.290
<v Speaker 2>15 minutes earlier</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I still get there because</v>

2269
01:35:12.291 --> 01:35:15.260
<v Speaker 2>that's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like at the same time it's hard not to</v>

2270
01:35:15.261 --> 01:35:18.440
<v Speaker 2>speed because when you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have these straightaways when</v>

2271
01:35:18.441 --> 01:35:23.090
<v Speaker 2>there are no cars near you and is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why the fuck is the speed limit 60 here?</v>

2272
01:35:23.091 --> 01:35:25.880
<v Speaker 2>Are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can go 100 safely easy.</v>

2273
01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:29.060
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time the idea of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I just.</v>

2274
01:35:29.690 --> 01:35:31.910
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to say if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you're doing like a 10 hour</v>

2275
01:35:31.911 --> 01:35:33.650
<v Speaker 2>drive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not saving anything significant.</v>

2276
01:35:33.710 --> 01:35:34.160
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2277
01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:37.650
<v Speaker 3>Then there's the idea of the man telling</v>
<v Speaker 3>you how fast you can go.</v>

2278
01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:39.870
<v Speaker 3>Fuck him man.</v>

2279
01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:44.160
<v Speaker 2>Well I think you should be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to unlock levels like on your driver's</v>

2280
01:35:44.161 --> 01:35:45.780
<v Speaker 2>license.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good idea.</v>

2281
01:35:45.870 --> 01:35:48.510
<v Speaker 2>Like I could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could get a 75 mile an hour speed</v>

2282
01:35:48.511 --> 01:35:50.100
<v Speaker 2>limit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could easily drive</v>

2283
01:35:50.150 --> 01:35:51.280
<v Speaker 3>75,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have no problem.</v>

2284
01:35:51.340 --> 01:35:52.990
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're like a race car driver,</v>

2285
01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:55.510
<v Speaker 3>if you know how to really drive and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're super responsible with your</v>

2286
01:35:55.511 --> 01:35:57.970
<v Speaker 3>choices of lane changing and things</v>
<v Speaker 3>along those lines,</v>

2287
01:35:58.030 --> 01:35:58.820
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should.</v>

2288
01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:00.860
<v Speaker 2>Being able to drive faster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is how do you enforce it?</v>

2289
01:36:00.861 --> 01:36:03.110
<v Speaker 2>You have to pull the person over and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then maybe get a sticker on your car,</v>

2290
01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:06.410
<v Speaker 2>something that's good and even drive an</v>
<v Speaker 2>ugly car.</v>

2291
01:36:06.770 --> 01:36:09.290
<v Speaker 2>Like I would drive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I give me a purple fender,</v>

2292
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:10.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>GimMe Gimme,</v>

2293
01:36:10.671 --> 01:36:12.860
<v Speaker 2>something ridiculous that the cops can</v>
<v Speaker 2>easily see that and go,</v>

2294
01:36:12.861 --> 01:36:14.330
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a $75 an hour guy</v>

2295
01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:17.170
<v Speaker 3>and if you text in your car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you text while you're driving,</v>

2296
01:36:17.171 --> 01:36:17.981
<v Speaker 3>when you actually move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2297
01:36:17.981 --> 01:36:21.220
<v Speaker 3>how many times have I looked over and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>saw this car acting weird and they're</v>

2298
01:36:21.221 --> 01:36:22.910
<v Speaker 3>texting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should just,</v>

2299
01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:26.560
<v Speaker 3>you should lose your license for a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the better question is when do we</v>

2300
01:36:26.561 --> 01:36:28.660
<v Speaker 3>pay on the show?</v>

<v Speaker 3>This is not.</v>

2370
01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:06.340
<v Speaker 3>This is not like a bulldog that'll just</v>
<v Speaker 3>sit there and is happy to just drink</v>

2371

2378
01:39:21.631 --> 01:39:24.930
<v Speaker 3>specific activity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In order to discourage that activity,</v>
