1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.120
Any other fighters still working on my music.
You know,
there's,

2
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.570
there's a lot of stress,
but it's all good stress.
There's so much going on.

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.930
There's so much on my plate right now.
There's so much shit that I'm doing.

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.020
You know what I mean?
If I want to put that all to the side,
we're off the air.

5
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.620
Yeah.
I used to and crashed Ustream.
You dirty bitches back on now.

6
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.770
Use Trim.
Silly.
They can't get their shit together.
Yeah,

7
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.970
it's,
it's uh,
I know one of the biggest problems people have been having lately,

8
00:00:28.971 --> 00:00:30.920
the,
uh,
uh,

9
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.470
where you're trying to watch it back and it stops and then starts back up again

10
00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:38.720
and it stops.
What's that from?
It's a,
they're adding new servers.

11
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.930
They're switching the super servers to new servers,

12
00:00:40.931 --> 00:00:45.070
so that should be fixed pretty soon.
Complaining this is all free.
You is fun.

13
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.130
It's a nice,
most of the time we concentrated on the audio version of this thing,

14
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.900
but,
uh,
but I,
I don't mind.
I'm just to on,
I think it's gonna be,
seems fine.

15
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.360
Eddie Heights from the bottom line is,
I'm down anytime.
Talk to that.

16
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.600
I'm not the one turning it down.
Hey,

17
00:01:01.601 --> 00:01:06.550
I saw you do your live show your music a couple of Sundays ago and I have seen

18
00:01:06.551 --> 00:01:07.440
you,
I think,
uh,

19
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.870
the last three or four times you've done the viper room and this last time a

20
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:12.880
fucking amazing man.

21
00:01:12.881 --> 00:01:16.240
You guys have really tightened your ship and it was really entertaining.

22
00:01:16.241 --> 00:01:21.130
Like it was pretty legit this time that last time around.
Thank you very much.

23
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.680
The secret was you,
your grease,

24
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.280
the sound guy and the stage manager a hundred bucks each and they treat you like

25
00:01:27.281 --> 00:01:29.830
royalty.
Exactly.
Really made it sound really good.

26
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.240
And usually those guys get paid $10 an hour.
They're like next,

27
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.850
another fucking shitty band.
Another shitty band.

28
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.420
They're just like not feeling it at all.
They don't want to hear anything.
Yeah.

29
00:01:40.421 --> 00:01:45.310
It was a perfect $100 that wakes that fucking asses up.
Yeah,
that was good,
man.

30
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.010
You guys got to say it's like tipping a,
a stripper,
a hundred bucks.

31
00:01:51.011 --> 00:01:53.260
That's deep.
You tip a stripper or 100 bucks,

32
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.560
you're going to take her to her maximum,
whatever that maximum is.

33
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.100
You tip a stripper or 100 bucks,
she's gonna go to the maximum.
Absolutely did.

34
00:02:00.101 --> 00:02:02.000
She can get away with it.
The club.
Yeah.
Are you,

35
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.330
are you doing that like on a regular basis now?

36
00:02:04.331 --> 00:02:06.830
You're going to be doing it like every month and a half,
two months or anything.

37
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.630
We're just playing and having fun and writing music and just produce and shit.

38
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.610
You know,
we got a lot of fucking new stuff.

39
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.610
It's taken forever to put this together because I'm a busy mother fucker.
Right.

40
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.670
I wish I could.
I moved closer to my recording studio.

41
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.870
I just moved to Sherman oaks.

42
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.590
The reason wants to get closer to that studio cause I need now start,

43
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.491
Shit's pumping.
You know,

44
00:02:24.491 --> 00:02:28.030
I've got a couple songs on the number back down to soundtrack.

45
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.200
One of them's a theme song dropped as the theme song.
Oh really?
Yeah.

46
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.550
They were going to use originally the Jujitsu song.
I thought,
I mean,

47
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.520
when Michael Jai White,

48
00:02:36.521 --> 00:02:39.260
the producer heard that he wanted that as a theme song right away.
Like,

49
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.530
like that second,
we're going to get Michael Jai white in here.
Yes.

50
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.780
So he's awesome.
He's a great guy.
He was a,
you know,

51
00:02:45.781 --> 00:02:50.781
he as he was Tyson Tyson and spawned to spawn super fucking cool guy.

52
00:02:51.791 --> 00:02:55.020
Like one of the most down normal guys who could ever hang out with.

53
00:02:55.021 --> 00:02:58.600
It's just so like,
like no bullshit.

54
00:02:58.601 --> 00:03:00.040
He's got like bullshit about them.

55
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.750
<v 1>You know what I mean?
Like super like even normal cool dude.
Yeah.</v>

56
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.460
Like the guys are good and he's a movie star man.
I mean he's,
he's fucking spawn,

57
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.250
you know,
but you're hanging out with them and he's like totally cool.

58
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.730
Totally normal.
You know,
it's got some great fucking story.

59
00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:20.260
Has been a lifelong martial artist and fights Kyokushin tuck tournament still.

60
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.460
He still goes in there and those fucking bare knuckle punch to the CEC chest leg

61
00:03:24.461 --> 00:03:28.810
kick,
head kick.
Tournament's macro shy white is no joke.
No joke dude.
I mean,

62
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.250
he no big,
he is six foot three,

63
00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:38.251
six foot four 235 pounds of super athletes.

64
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.540
I mean,
and he's explosive.
I've been holy Shit.
I mean,

65
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.570
the stuff he does that he doesn't like a never back down to first of all,

66
00:03:48.881 --> 00:03:49.631
never backed down.

67
00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:54.631
One as if you don't know is the first MMA movie to go mainstream.

68
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.780
That was the biggest MMA MMA movie to date,
but it was terrible.

69
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.590
They made it into like the fast and the furious NMA and it was terrible.

70
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.290
But the one thing I remember,
the thing is these days,
right?

71
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.260
Everything seems to have the same sort of tone to it.
These young,

72
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.470
they're letting you know and like these fast and furious,

73
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:13.150
never back to any of those kinds of movies.

74
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.300
They're letting you know we're never going to get real deep.
Like we're all,

75
00:04:16.301 --> 00:04:17.380
we're all just,
we're,

76
00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:20.860
we're agreeing to this right off the bat what it is he like a music video.

77
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.340
What it is is these,
the people that can make movies and put them right in,

78
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.000
the guys that have that power,
they really don't know that much about MMA.

79
00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:31.780
They just got into it and they're like,
I'm going to make an m and a movie.

80
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.630
I'm going to make them fighting movie mad like this.

81
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.750
Tap out stuff and they're the guys with the power.

82
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.600
They're not going to let the guys that could really put together an authentic

83
00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:41.380
and then they movie,

84
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.470
how are they going to get their movie or this movie company can only,

85
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.480
it's only pushing three movies a year.

86
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.820
This one's only pushing 10 you know what I mean?

87
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.890
You're going to get yours on that spotlight.
Well,

88
00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:54.340
someone did and obviously there are a bunch of knuckleheads that put that movie

89
00:04:54.341 --> 00:04:57.220
together.
The first one,
the first one is really bad.

90
00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.340
It's the stories always liked the new guy in town.

91
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.010
You know he's really handsome and all the,

92
00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:07.630
all the other guys that are bad guys in town.
There's got to be hot chicks.
Sure.

93
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.150
Oh the meats,
the girlfriend and you know the,

94
00:05:11.151 --> 00:05:15.370
the guy doesn't treat her good and this new guy does and it's the same formula

95
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.830
with it.
We could do a scary movie,
we can do it and then they move here.

96
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.060
Now we need to do a race car movie with that.

97
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.650
We're going to do a dancing movie where they like dance off.
Same story though.

98
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.490
It's the same guys.
It's the guys with the green light power.
They're not idiots.

99
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.950
They're not,
they just don't know the sport that well.
That's a,

100
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.390
they don't know how the little things that an NMA expert can just like pick it

101
00:05:37.391 --> 00:05:38.920
apart.
Like the little things,

102
00:05:38.921 --> 00:05:42.070
like they're fighting and they're fighting and like in the circle of people

103
00:05:42.071 --> 00:05:45.310
standing out,
you know,
there's,
you know what I'm saying?

104
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.200
When Steven Seagal had become really famous,
they started a,
uh,
like a search,

105
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.830
like different studios were having searches of martial artists all across the

106
00:05:53.831 --> 00:05:58.640
country find the next Steven Seagal.
And so they,
with me in New York,

107
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.430
and uh,
I don't remember what studio it was about,

108
00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:04.580
but I said that the number one problem with martial arts movies is that a real

109
00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:07.850
martial artist is going to look at that shit and go,
that's not real.

110
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.900
That can't happen.
That's,
that looks,
that's unrealistic.
And they were like,
crap,

111
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.660
they got arrogant with me.
They were like,
that's ridiculous.
No.

112
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.660
Who's going to know you?
And like a few other people,
believe me,

113
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.200
it doesn't matter.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It does.
It arrogant.
He was really arrogant about it.

114
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:24.740
I'm like,
I'm telling you as a person,
like if you're a guitar player,
okay,

115
00:06:24.741 --> 00:06:28.100
and you're watching some fucking movie about the Buddy Holly Story and there's a

116
00:06:28.101 --> 00:06:31.070
guy playing guitar and you know he's not really playing guitar.

117
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.150
That would drive you crazy if you saw some guy and he's doing this and the music

118
00:06:35.151 --> 00:06:38.550
is coming out,
but you know this motherfucker is not playing that music.
Yeah.

119
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.890
It's that game plan as a musician.
Wouldn't that drive you fucking nuts?
Totally.

120
00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:45.620
You can pick that out.
Yeah,
we totally crazy.
Yeah.
You always,

121
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.040
you always check the technique.
Yeah,
and I was telling these guys,
I'm like,
look,

122
00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:51.770
there's some bad ass shit that you can do that's real,

123
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.840
that really does work and I can show you,

124
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.090
I can show you some bad ass shit that really works.

125
00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.290
But all this flying double scissor kick two dudes at the same time.

126
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.550
That's silly nonsense.
This is silliness.
Like you're doing silly stuff.

127
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.800
I remember walking out,
I've never back down one going,
okay,
it sucked.

128
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:13.750
But at least they got the mainstream use to armbars and triangles and at least

129
00:07:13.751 --> 00:07:17.140
it got them used to looking at fights.
Movie,
big movie fight.

130
00:07:17.141 --> 00:07:20.030
Do you remember there's a triangle and arm bar that's kind of lethal weapon

131
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.120
whore.
Yeah,
that was the triangle.

132
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.890
Pouring Gracie was a fight coordinator for lethal weapon,

133
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.190
but in movies like that,
you see stuff like that every now and then sprinkled in,

134
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:33.290
but like in it never back down.
They explained it,
their training it,

135
00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:35.920
it's like a new,
like a secret weapon.
So it,

136
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:39.110
they focused on it and I can and lethal weapon,
he gets him in a triangle,

137
00:07:39.111 --> 00:07:42.980
but they didn't say,
wow,
look what he's actually doing it.
They just,

138
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.470
most people didn't even know that was a technique.
They're like,
oh he got,

139
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:49.310
he had him between his legs,
like they don't even see the technique.
You know,

140
00:07:49.311 --> 00:07:53.060
I can't think triangle without thinking about rampage,

141
00:07:53.061 --> 00:07:56.960
Jackson and Arona when enter ever anybody even mentions the word triangle.

142
00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.560
All I think about is that fight because that was the craziest end to a triangle

143
00:08:00.561 --> 00:08:03.560
attempt ever.
And rampage picked him up like a pillow and slammed them.

144
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:05.510
Do you remember we were over here watching that shit.

145
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.020
Do you remember how scary that was?
That was scary.
Look,

146
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.860
if you put that in a movie,
you would say bullshit.
You kept,

147
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.360
that could never really happen.
Yeah,

148
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.790
but you know how I think that's it hasn't happened since and we you,

149
00:08:16.791 --> 00:08:20.270
you said this,
I'll never forget you said,
Ooh,
he might be dead.
Yeah,

150
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:23.630
we were watching this and you went,
Ooh,
he might be dead.
Like that was,

151
00:08:23.631 --> 00:08:25.820
that was the key.
If you never seen that slam.

152
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:30.320
He's trying to get a Rhona's trying to get rampage and a triangle and rampage

153
00:08:30.321 --> 00:08:35.321
defends it by picking him up over his head and slamming them down full force on

154
00:08:36.861 --> 00:08:40.610
the ground and then head budding him if collided heads accidentally be just from

155
00:08:40.611 --> 00:08:42.320
the impact.
It was a double.
It was a double whammy,

156
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:45.920
but if that would've happened on concrete,
he would have been a vegetable.

157
00:08:45.921 --> 00:08:50.030
If he was lucky,
he was lucky.
He was probably going to be dead.

158
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.000
But if you're the best of like damn,
at least you kept him alive.

159
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.340
That's how hard it had hit.
His head exploded.

160
00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:00.750
I wonder if that's affecting his career now and no FERC shore.
It is.

161
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:05.190
You think unquestionably that was a fucking violent knockout man.

162
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.770
That was an unbelievably violent knockout.

163
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.620
And then right afterwards circled you knocked him out number.
Yeah.

164
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:12.960
So that was two in a row.
You know when you get,

165
00:09:12.961 --> 00:09:16.500
when you get bombed out like that there.
So could you,
one was brutal to man,

166
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:17.850
so could you out of the gate,

167
00:09:17.851 --> 00:09:19.830
do you remember how scary that guy was out of the gate?

168
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:25.060
Out of the gate knocks out Nogueira Cheerio Noguera and then Arona two in a row

169
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.830
and does it like he's just going to steam roll everyone.
Yeah,

170
00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:30.030
it looks like a mad destroy Jesus.

171
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.210
And then someone told me you got to watch a fight of his against Glover to

172
00:09:33.211 --> 00:09:36.870
sharer.
You know who was one of the guys from a chucks?

173
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:39.870
Chucks camp from Slo.
Do Remember that guy?
Yeah.

174
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.560
Big really strong light heavyweight.
But he had like,
these are problems.

175
00:09:43.561 --> 00:09:48.000
I think we had a really scary dude,
dangerous,
dangerous dude.
And He,
uh,
he,

176
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.160
he fought,
soca,
June broke him,
he fought so joint,

177
00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:55.020
stopped him with strikes and then you know that this was all after that.

178
00:09:55.021 --> 00:09:56.040
That was apparently early,

179
00:09:56.041 --> 00:09:59.430
early on he says it wasn't like one of those guys that almost maybe got thrown

180
00:09:59.431 --> 00:10:02.040
into the deep end too quick.
Yeah.
It's never too late for,

181
00:10:02.041 --> 00:10:04.260
so could you suck that you'd just focused on,

182
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.480
on getting really good at Jujitsu and not,

183
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:10.080
and not end up like a one of those fighters,
you know,

184
00:10:10.081 --> 00:10:14.460
one of those Olympic wrestlers that never learned Jujitsu,
you know,
you,

185
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:18.690
if he falls in love with Jujitsu,
continues to progress with the striking,

186
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.470
he's going to be a force.
But he's,
if he doesn't learn Jiu Jitsu,

187
00:10:22.471 --> 00:10:25.430
if he doesn't fall in love with Jiu Jitsu,
his chances are very slim of,

188
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:29.300
of getting to the top.
It's real weird when you see,
you know,

189
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.960
you always like to say,
well,
you know,

190
00:10:30.961 --> 00:10:33.450
there's certain amount of loss as a fighter has and then they're done.

191
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:36.900
But every now and then there's a guy who comes along that just defies that shit

192
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:40.120
that like loses a bunch of times with then gets it together and then start

193
00:10:40.121 --> 00:10:41.790
sweating.
Jorge Santiago,

194
00:10:41.791 --> 00:10:46.720
he's a good example that Anderson Silva was just run of the mill Leo Machida for

195
00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.440
a few years.
They were like,
ah,
he's all right.

196
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:51.720
So the fighters right now that you're thinking of it,
I mean,

197
00:10:51.721 --> 00:10:55.080
I'm talking about losses,
I'm talking about bouncing back from loss.
Machida,

198
00:10:55.081 --> 00:10:58.050
you know,
only bounced back from the shogun loss.
But like Allister,

199
00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:01.080
Allister over him,
I think he's been stopped nine times.

200
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:06.150
Bobby Hoffman stopped him,
you know,
uh,
he,
he got submitted by Verdugo.

201
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:10.230
Harriton off,
stopped him.
Chuck stopped him.
A lot of guys stopped him.

202
00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.320
And if you looked at him on paper with all those stoppages,
you'd say,

203
00:11:13.321 --> 00:11:16.560
well how is this guy ever going to be the best?
But then you look at him now,

204
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:21.380
Shit,
he's one of the best man.
And his Jujitsu is good.
Yeah,
kill you with.
Yeah.

205
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.270
And he's,
he is striking is no one's close deck.

206
00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:29.130
That mother fucker is the Strikeforce Grand Prix champion and,
or the,
excuse me,

207
00:11:29.131 --> 00:11:33.240
the k one Grand Prix champion and the Strikeforce champion and the dream

208
00:11:33.241 --> 00:11:35.460
champion.
Who the fuck has ever been able to do that?

209
00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:38.490
Do kickboxing at the highest level and MMA,

210
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:42.750
the thing that saves over is that he mastered the Guillotine.

211
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.960
Anybody tried to take him down?
You got to take them down.

212
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.780
I mean most people aren't going to try to stand with them.

213
00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:50.610
There's gonna to be a couple,
you know,

214
00:11:50.611 --> 00:11:54.160
brave motherfuckers out there that try to stand with them.
There will be an MMA

215
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.440
<v 2>but usually they're going to try to take him down.</v>

216
00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.460
They got to worry about that getting his,
getting his death.
He's,

217
00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.860
he's fucking submitted Vituro with it and he's,
he's good in his ground.

218
00:12:02.861 --> 00:12:06.250
Game is good too because his brother Valentine over him.

219
00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:10.450
He hasn't had a successful career as of yet.
He still fighting,

220
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.510
but he's a real smart guy and is in love with Jujitsu.

221
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:17.780
Valentine Overeem's Jujitsu.
Really,
really good.
That's his brother.
So it's,

222
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.380
it's rubbing off on him cause cause uh,
um,

223
00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:25.430
Overeem Alster one lone star,
he run the uh,

224
00:12:25.431 --> 00:12:29.410
Abu Dhabi European trials or something like that.
Don't quote me on it,

225
00:12:29.411 --> 00:12:33.340
but I know his Jujitsu is good and that's the key.
All you guys out there,

226
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:35.440
I know I had never fought,
but in my opinion,

227
00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:38.850
I've been in the business getting paid since 2000.

228
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:43.570
That's watching fighters come and go watching fight camps come and go meeting

229
00:12:43.571 --> 00:12:46.390
all these guys and get it.
I'm like,
I'm experiment.

230
00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:51.370
Like I go through their lives and it's never too late to get your career

231
00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:54.910
together.
You have to fall in love with Jujitsu.

232
00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:58.840
Of course you need like the mental state together.
You got to have,
you kept,

233
00:12:58.841 --> 00:13:03.190
you don't have a fragile ego and you gotta,
you gotta have a warrior's mind.

234
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.950
But if you have a warrior's mind,
you love to fight,
you'd love to train.

235
00:13:05.951 --> 00:13:09.850
You have a great worth work ethic.
Please fall in love with some Jujitsu,

236
00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.790
fall in love with it.
Then you become dangerous on the ground.

237
00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.990
A wrestler who is not interested in learning how to take people out.

238
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:20.740
That's like a basketball player,
not interested in like shooting the ball.

239
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.530
I just want to dribble.
I'm just going to dribble.
I don't need to shoot the ball.

240
00:13:23.531 --> 00:13:25.990
I'm just going to dribble.
Look at me.
I'm a great dribbler.
Yeah,

241
00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.960
you're dribbling is awesome.
You got to get good at closing the show,

242
00:13:28.961 --> 00:13:29.980
making some points.

243
00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:35.080
How could you be a wrestler and not be in love with choking next fall in love

244
00:13:35.081 --> 00:13:39.700
with it.
Study Marcello Garcia.
He's got a website,
30 bucks a month.

245
00:13:39.701 --> 00:13:43.600
If you're in an MMA right now and you're not studying Marcello Garcia,

246
00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:47.800
you're behind the times.
He's the number one guy in Jujitsu,
number one,

247
00:13:47.801 --> 00:13:51.370
and no Gi Jujitsu.
No one's better than him.
If you're an MMA fighter,

248
00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:55.750
fall in love with Marcello Garcia.
That's a great start.

249
00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:57.820
Jeff Glover,
another great start.

250
00:13:57.821 --> 00:14:02.260
If you fall in love with Jeff Glover and Marcella Garcia bone,
both of them.

251
00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:03.490
You know what I'm saying?

252
00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:07.840
Any glass of course or some dude who just likes to stand.
Yeah,
that's good too,

253
00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.660
but you're going to go so far.
They in,

254
00:14:10.661 --> 00:14:15.040
in what I've seen working backstage and all these goddamn shows for the UFC for

255
00:14:15.041 --> 00:14:19.630
eight years.
That's what I see.
I see the guys come and go,
come and go.

256
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:22.540
And the main thing at the very top,
at the very top,

257
00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:26.020
even if you're a Brazilian jujitsu black belt and you won the Mundey hours a

258
00:14:26.021 --> 00:14:28.780
bunch of times,
what I see,

259
00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.870
I see the prelims for the last eight years.

260
00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.590
A lot of people don't see what's going on in the prelims,
just getting signed.

261
00:14:35.591 --> 00:14:39.790
If you're under one 70 and you get signed to the UFC,
that doesn't mean shit.

262
00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.550
You got to get through the prelims to get to the main card.

263
00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:45.140
You know how many fights you got to win to be on the main carding here?

264
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.000
170 pounds.
They're going to put you on the main card.
You gotta,

265
00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:50.350
you gotta win more than than two fights and you better be exciting.

266
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:53.900
So getting signed to the UFC is like those,
and I've used this before,

267
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:57.530
it's like those turtles that they're born,
they're hatched in the,
yeah,

268
00:14:57.531 --> 00:14:58.850
you're born,
yeah you're alive.

269
00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:02.360
But now you got to get past the seagull and all the crabs attack and you good

270
00:15:02.361 --> 00:15:06.900
luck making it to the ocean.
The main card.
Good luck.
It's really hard in the guy.

271
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:11.270
My point is there's a,
I see a lot of guys come and never make it to the prelim.

272
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.390
It's been a lot of Brazilian Jujitsu,
black belts out there.

273
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:15.530
I don't want to say any names.

274
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.890
A lot of them come through and they just get smashed by wrestlers.

275
00:15:18.891 --> 00:15:21.110
No one ever sees it.
No one ever talks about it.

276
00:15:21.111 --> 00:15:24.230
It's not on the underground and they just disappear.
There's been a lot of them.

277
00:15:24.231 --> 00:15:24.650
There's God,

278
00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:28.600
there's been guys that rise in our stars like Charles Olivera and that Rocher

279
00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:31.010
guy.
I liked those guys.
I want them to,
you know,
they,

280
00:15:31.011 --> 00:15:35.150
their submissions look slick.
Nogi but there's a lot of guys they get,

281
00:15:35.151 --> 00:15:39.710
they can't get to the main card cause they couldn't get past the elite wrestler.

282
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:43.460
Even though there were a black belt and the in the g they're on their back.

283
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.340
The guard is okay.
Sometimes things catch,

284
00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:51.290
but overall I see a lot of guys lose decisions because they're on their back

285
00:15:51.291 --> 00:15:54.830
against them.
Average college wrestler,
they couldn't get past,

286
00:15:54.831 --> 00:15:58.160
but I see that a lot.
That's what I've seen.
Unless I,

287
00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:02.690
unless I dreamed it or it's a like an like I'm having delusions.

288
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:06.770
That's well,
that's what I thought I,
I see.
I see a lot of guys come through.

289
00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.350
They don't have the answer for the elite wrestler.
You,

290
00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:12.770
if you haven't wrestled your whole life,
if you haven't wrestled your whole life,

291
00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:13.843
guess what?

292
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:17.270
Most of the guys at the top have wrestled and you better have the answer for

293
00:16:17.271 --> 00:16:18.440
them.
That's your worst nightmare.

294
00:16:18.441 --> 00:16:21.590
You better be training for that wrestler right now because that's what you're

295
00:16:21.591 --> 00:16:22.670
going to hit.
And every year,

296
00:16:22.671 --> 00:16:25.820
more and more wrestlers are quitting their job at fucking home depot and they're

297
00:16:25.821 --> 00:16:29.660
watching the ultimate fighter go.
And I could be famous too.
I wrestled 23 years.

298
00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.450
Fuck this life.
They got three kids,
they hate their wife.

299
00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:36.080
There's a lot of these guys coming.
They're coming.
They want to be famous too.

300
00:16:36.081 --> 00:16:40.070
There's a new celebrity in town and it's the MMA fighter and these guys,

301
00:16:40.071 --> 00:16:42.830
they're a bunch of them that judo guys are going to shoot.
I could do it too.

302
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.610
I almost went to the Olympics and judo.
There's all these guys coming up.

303
00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:50.570
What are you going to do to them?
These guys are used to being on top.

304
00:16:50.571 --> 00:16:52.910
They'd been wrestling since two.
You're going to start wrestling now.

305
00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:55.970
If you haven't wrestled your whole life,
your guard better be amazing.

306
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.400
A better be Ninja when they talk about your guard,

307
00:16:58.401 --> 00:17:01.370
you think you're going to make it to the top and MMA and you haven't wrestled

308
00:17:01.371 --> 00:17:02.150
your whole life.

309
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:05.180
If they're not talking about your guard like it's fucking phenomenal.

310
00:17:05.181 --> 00:17:07.250
So dangerous.
Stay away from the scar.
It's amazing.

311
00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:08.720
If they're not saying that about your guard,

312
00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:12.070
your chances are slim that you're going to get past the elite wrestler cause

313
00:17:12.071 --> 00:17:15.530
you're not going to be on top for sure.
And it's a 50 50 beat 'em strike.

314
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.900
If you beat him striking,
you know you might win a few.

315
00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.860
<v 3>These new young guys,
man,
all of them are super equipped.</v>

316
00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:23.920
Like this Michael McDonald kid,
that font this weekend.
Did you see that fight?

317
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:26.180
<v 2>I didn't see that.
Oh my God.
What</v>

318
00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.280
<v 3>a fight.
Edwin Figaroa,
Michael McDonald,</v>

319
00:17:28.281 --> 00:17:32.780
they fought at 145 prelim one 45 or one 35 I think it was one 45.

320
00:17:32.781 --> 00:17:34.040
Forgive me if I'm not sure.
Yeah,

321
00:17:34.041 --> 00:17:37.730
it was one of the prelims that aired on like Facebook or one of those things

322
00:17:37.731 --> 00:17:39.500
maybe with spike and I think it was Facebook though,

323
00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:43.400
is fucking kid is super talented dude.
Super talented.

324
00:17:43.401 --> 00:17:47.750
And both of them are the Figaroa took the fight on six days notice and cut 20

325
00:17:47.751 --> 00:17:50.130
pounds to,
to make the weight class.
I'm pretty sure it's one

326
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.070
<v 2>35 either way.
Um,
uh,</v>

327
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:55.410
Figaroa cut all this fucking weight and uh,

328
00:17:55.411 --> 00:17:59.190
was getting his ass kicked in the first round but then just gutted it out and

329
00:17:59.191 --> 00:18:01.890
starts going after him.
And the second round and the third round,
dude,

330
00:18:01.891 --> 00:18:05.280
it was a just a crazy fucking fight.
But this kid,

331
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:10.080
a Mcdonald had him in a triangle armbar combination.
He had his back.
He just,

332
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:11.610
it was,
it was sick,

333
00:18:11.611 --> 00:18:16.470
sick display of striking and Jujitsu together and these fucking 20 years old
man,

334
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.100
all these new guys that are coming up,
they can do everything.
They can wrestle,

335
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.700
they can do Jujitsu,
they're good off their back.
They're all good off their back.

336
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.240
They you have to be,
that's the next stage.
There's no getting past that.

337
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:31.980
There's no way ultimately being having an average guard like most,

338
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.420
you know,
just most typical MMA fighters,

339
00:18:34.421 --> 00:18:36.870
just that average guard that we're seeing now.

340
00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.690
That's if you have that you're gone.
Well,

341
00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:44.720
I felt it the days of a guide not being good at any of the aspects of MMA or on

342
00:18:45.361 --> 00:18:48.210
the way out.
There's not that many room.
There's not that much room left.

343
00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.010
It's like it's like every other sport man.

344
00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:54.120
It gets broken down to its bare essentials and everything gets exposed and now

345
00:18:54.121 --> 00:18:56.310
that we know the bare essentials there,
it's real simple.

346
00:18:56.311 --> 00:18:58.410
You have to have all of them in place.
You have to have wrestling,

347
00:18:58.411 --> 00:19:01.530
you have to have striking,
you have to be good off your back.
You get on top,

348
00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:03.270
it's a science and we've,

349
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.900
both of us have worked backstage and we see these guys come and go.

350
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:09.300
It really is a strange perspective for me.

351
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:14.100
I'm getting to see what every fight I see in the truck for the last eight years.

352
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.170
I'm analyzing what works and what doesn't.

353
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.940
I'm constantly doing the research and talking to these guys seem come see him.

354
00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:23.370
[inaudible] I could put careers together like charts,
you know,

355
00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:27.350
Emily as a weird arrogance to not want it to learn some aspects of the sport.

356
00:19:27.351 --> 00:19:32.190
Yes,
that's,
that's the problem.
Basically.
If,
if the people you roll with it,

357
00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.150
this is,
you know,

358
00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:37.500
if you're an MMA fighter and the people you roll with aren't talking about your

359
00:19:37.501 --> 00:19:40.950
Jujitsu,
like it's amazing,
man,
your chances are slim.

360
00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:44.820
That's why people eventually you see these stars rise.
And again,

361
00:19:44.821 --> 00:19:48.540
this is all coming from a guy,
a scientist studying charts backstage.

362
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:52.440
I've never fought.
I'm not a bad ass.
I'm not an athlete.
I'm not this tough dude.

363
00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:57.000
I just,
I just noticed things.
That's all I notice.
Things,
you know,
uh,
on a,

364
00:19:57.001 --> 00:20:01.470
on a hyper level.
And I notice that the fighters that come and go,

365
00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.680
the ones that come,
if you put them on,
I can't name names,
that's the problem.

366
00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:09.120
Go See,
seem common.
You then you see them go.
If you put them all together,
they,

367
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:13.010
they're Jujitsu was never discussed.
One common denominator was their digits.

368
00:20:13.011 --> 00:20:16.650
It was probably never discussed as something lethal at their own gym.

369
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.550
You know what I mean?
Probably not.
I could,
I could go on all level.

370
00:20:20.551 --> 00:20:22.800
There's a lot of guys who can get away with just wrestling and really good

371
00:20:22.801 --> 00:20:25.000
striking for awhile.
Fight for awhile.
Yeah.

372
00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:28.290
If you can keep the fuck gotta be good at everything and people are leaving out

373
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:31.770
razor sharp,
finishing Jujitsu,
then leaving that out.

374
00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.950
There's a lot of guys that are spending most of their,

375
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:37.230
their their time working on the striking,
which is great.

376
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:40.350
But I think the main concern as you know what,
I'm going to be as tough as I can.

377
00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.570
I don't want to be exposed.
I don't want to get,
not,

378
00:20:42.571 --> 00:20:45.900
I'm going to do everything I can to not get knocked the fuck out in front of the

379
00:20:45.901 --> 00:20:50.740
world.
So most people on the striking,
I totally understand that.
But you have,

380
00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.470
if you want to make,
if you want to fight,

381
00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.920
if you want a long career and you want a long successful career,

382
00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:01.150
you have to fall in love with Jujitsu.
And that means you have to get into,

383
00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.930
you have to study.
The top guys in the top guys are Marcello Hydro,

384
00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:09.030
Gracie and Jeff Glover that just the most beautiful Jujitsu.

385
00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.590
Just watch that and you got to start getting into that.

386
00:21:11.591 --> 00:21:14.860
If you're not into it and your career's not going that great,

387
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:19.330
ask yourself that question.
Think about,
think about what I'm saying.
Um,
you know,

388
00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:23.120
you got to fall in love with Jujitsu.
You have to not just striking,

389
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:25.700
<v 3>especially if you want,
look,
if you like fighting,</v>

390
00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.970
you're going to want to have a career that's long and yet you're going to want

391
00:21:28.971 --> 00:21:31.160
to take as little damage as possible.

392
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:34.940
And if you don't have like a really good submissions of that option isn't in

393
00:21:34.941 --> 00:21:37.400
your toolbox at all times,
you know you're going to,

394
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:40.040
you're going to engage in longer fights in necessary.

395
00:21:40.041 --> 00:21:44.120
You're going to get more damage than necessary.
You know,
there's guys that uh,

396
00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:46.940
would see,
you know,
that I have equal striking,

397
00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:50.630
but one guy will see an opening for a submission and jump on it once he's,

398
00:21:50.631 --> 00:21:53.780
even though he's striking with the guy because he recognizes is the correct

399
00:21:53.781 --> 00:21:55.380
thing to do,
that it's there and,

400
00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:57.620
but for some guys they don't have that option in a toolbox.

401
00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:00.530
And if you don't have that option in your toolbox,
you're going to have a longer,

402
00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.700
you're going to have longer fights,

403
00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:03.500
they're gonna how they're going to be more brutal.

404
00:22:03.501 --> 00:22:04.610
You're going to take more damage

405
00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:07.610
<v 2>and you have less options and you can get her overall,</v>

406
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.640
whoever has the less options is going to do not as good.

407
00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.730
<v 3>And if there's more time fighting,
there's more time you're getting hit,</v>

408
00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.560
there's more chances of you getting hurt.
It's that simple.

409
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:17.960
It's really that simple.
If you want to lengthen your career,

410
00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:20.120
you want to be as effective as possible.

411
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:22.250
And if you want to have the most dynamic career,

412
00:22:22.251 --> 00:22:25.010
you want to be as effective as plot,
take whatever the fuck is there.

413
00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:26.990
That's why George Saint Pierre,
so good.

414
00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:31.100
Joseph George Saint Pierre never commits to doing anything.
I mean he might be,

415
00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.820
he might be.
He might decide the game plan is to box you,

416
00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:38.330
but if you take him down,
it's not like he hasn't been working on his guard.

417
00:22:38.331 --> 00:22:41.090
It's not like he hasn't been working on getting right back up to his feet and

418
00:22:41.091 --> 00:22:44.570
it's not like he's not really comfortable strangle you on the ground.

419
00:22:44.571 --> 00:22:45.260
If it's there,

420
00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:47.960
he's not going to stand up and let you stand up and start banging it out with

421
00:22:47.961 --> 00:22:49.940
you again.
If he sees an opening,
he's going to take it.

422
00:22:49.941 --> 00:22:50.774
He's going to strangle you.

423
00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:54.210
<v 2>Oh,
are we ever going to see George singing Pierre be put on his back?</v>

424
00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:58.290
He fight some guy that just putting him on his back at will and we're going to

425
00:22:58.291 --> 00:23:00.820
have to see how good George Saint Pierre as guard is,

426
00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:01.990
this thing that'll ever happen.

427
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:06.440
<v 3>Fight easily.
Could be that Jake shields could easily get ahold of George.
Yes.</v>

428
00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:10.380
I think standup wise,
standup wise,
George is very fluid.

429
00:23:10.381 --> 00:23:15.060
He's much more fluid.
He's he's,
he's more capable.
His Jab is nasty.

430
00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:19.290
That that uh,
he does that Superman Jab to at fucks you up with it.
He's,

431
00:23:19.291 --> 00:23:23.870
he's nasty on his feet,
man.
His leg kicks George.
Oh for sure he's nasty.
He,

432
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:27.840
he wants a kickboxing contest with Tiago albums basically.
I mean that,

433
00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:30.600
I mean there was some take downs in that fight,
but the kickboxing part of it,

434
00:23:30.601 --> 00:23:33.120
the standup part,
George won that shit.
Georgia's a beast.

435
00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.900
So Jake is at a significant disadvantage standing up.

436
00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:40.430
But Jake is a mother fucker.
Dude have,
it's

437
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:41.270
<v 2>a hold of him.</v>

438
00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:44.990
If he gets that fucking double under hooks on George and really squeezes,

439
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:48.050
if somehow or another you finds himself in a position where you know,

440
00:23:48.051 --> 00:23:51.920
George zigs when he should have zags or he somehow or another gets him pressed

441
00:23:51.921 --> 00:23:53.780
up against the cage and actually gets a hold of them,

442
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:57.710
things get real interesting man.
Things get real interest.
It's all,

443
00:23:57.711 --> 00:24:00.440
it's all about how they're going to match up.
I mean,
I could see,

444
00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:01.670
I could see it two ways.

445
00:24:01.671 --> 00:24:06.671
I can see Jake shields taking maybe 90 seconds to pass Georgia's guard and then

446
00:24:08.601 --> 00:24:13.310
he finally passes and then within a minute he sinks in a rear naked choke or

447
00:24:13.311 --> 00:24:15.860
some good teen and then puts him out and you're like,
wow man,

448
00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.890
he and he took his time,
but he sort of went through Georgia.

449
00:24:18.891 --> 00:24:23.870
I could see that maybe or I could also see him not being able to pass George

450
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:26.120
Sand Pierre Guard,
George Saint Pierre has garden might be insane.

451
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:28.670
Like by this time,
the last time we saw it,

452
00:24:28.671 --> 00:24:31.490
I think it was maybe Carl prison or something.
I forget the last time we saw it,

453
00:24:31.491 --> 00:24:34.010
but he was on his back.
I don't think he did that much,

454
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:38.330
but now who knows?
Yeah,
he's preparing for navy.
Yeah.

455
00:24:38.331 --> 00:24:41.320
Maybe his maybe Jake shields,
cat past Georgia boy.

456
00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:44.210
He passes the half guard and then he passed the site control and then he

457
00:24:44.211 --> 00:24:46.940
recovers and like,
damn,
he's got a pass again.
One of those battles,

458
00:24:46.941 --> 00:24:51.410
one of those chess matches and if it's like that,
maybe later on the rounds,

459
00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:54.200
George Saint Pierre has a child tired.
Jake shields.

460
00:24:54.201 --> 00:24:57.560
Jake shields is able to get like one take down out of three or four attempts.

461
00:24:57.561 --> 00:25:00.450
He's able to get them,
drag them down,
but damn,
now he can pass his garden.

462
00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:04.700
He's getting tired now he's got to stand and he's taught.
That could happen too.

463
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.710
Or he could go through them.
Fuck,
who knows?
It's a total mystery,
a total mystery.

464
00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:12.290
It can go both ways and I'd go,
Oh damn.
And went that way.

465
00:25:12.291 --> 00:25:15.290
I'm super excited for that.
Who knows?
I'm super excited for that.

466
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:19.010
In another scenario is Jake shield cannot take down George Saint Pierre.

467
00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:22.270
Not even once.
That's another scenario.
Sure.
That,
I mean,

468
00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.100
if that happened I'd be like,
damn,

469
00:25:24.101 --> 00:25:27.500
it's rustling wasn't good enough because if you look at Josh Koscheck,
man,

470
00:25:27.501 --> 00:25:32.501
Josh Koscheck on paper was a better wrestler than Jake shields on paper.

471
00:25:32.781 --> 00:25:35.660
He did more in college.
He was like,
uh,
an all American,

472
00:25:35.661 --> 00:25:37.520
maybe a national champion once I think.

473
00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:41.810
I think he was the best chocolate delta and Josh Koscheck was the best college.

474
00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:43.470
How fast.
Yeah.

475
00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:48.530
So he couldn't fuck with GSP would have Jake shields can't take down by as much

476
00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:50.510
as possible to fuck your ass boss.

477
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:54.680
Well maybe he takes him down super easy or maybe it looks like,
like if you were,

478
00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:55.011
you know,

479
00:25:55.011 --> 00:25:59.930
an interesting thing with the Phil Davis Nogueira fight was Phil Davis could not

480
00:25:59.931 --> 00:26:02.660
take down to log in that first round and it looked,

481
00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:06.500
it looked like for me if I was still,
David says coach,
I'm like,
man,

482
00:26:06.501 --> 00:26:08.990
you can't take them down,
but you know what Phil Davis kept doing.

483
00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:13.370
He kept trying and then the second round he just kept trying and then he finally

484
00:26:13.371 --> 00:26:15.620
got him down.
He switched it from doubles or singles,

485
00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:19.070
so he just kept fucking plugging away with the wrestling.

486
00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.590
A lot of wrestlers at that point,
what he just said,
fuck it.

487
00:26:21.591 --> 00:26:24.290
I'm going to stand with them and take my chances there will Phil Davis is so

488
00:26:24.291 --> 00:26:26.450
confident with his wrestling.
Yeah,
he just stuck with you.

489
00:26:26.451 --> 00:26:27.440
Here is post fight interview.

490
00:26:27.441 --> 00:26:30.530
He had a lot of physical problems coming into this camp and apparently,
yeah,

491
00:26:30.531 --> 00:26:33.440
you got an injured a couple times and he was having some real problems where he

492
00:26:33.441 --> 00:26:35.060
wasn't sure if it was going to go through the fight.

493
00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:38.270
You see how fast he flicks up those?
The head kicks,
dude,

494
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:42.920
Holy Shit.
He landed that front kick to the face like a person does too.

495
00:26:42.921 --> 00:26:44.150
It's crazy.
His,

496
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:48.830
<v 3>his legs are so powerful and so fast.
He just springs up.
God,
he's down.</v>

497
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:51.900
He's got the most ridiculous mesomorphic build ever.

498
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.800
As far as like you look at like the classic Mesomorph,
you know where's there's,

499
00:26:55.801 --> 00:26:58.600
there's different body structures.
ECTOMORPH was it?

500
00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.000
What does it was the other one,

501
00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:04.080
I don't know any of those morphs spreads or more I have to morph endomorph

502
00:27:04.081 --> 00:27:07.800
endomorph endomorph is always like,
I never spend a penny over waves.

503
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:12.600
Ectomorph is like really skinny and Mesomorphs are like really wide shoulders.

504
00:27:12.601 --> 00:27:13.830
It heavily muscled,

505
00:27:13.831 --> 00:27:18.090
like really like super athlete builds and he's got a perfect mesomorphic built

506
00:27:18.091 --> 00:27:20.610
his like his hips are like really narrow,

507
00:27:20.611 --> 00:27:25.290
but then it flares out to like big shoulders.
You know,
he's a spectacular,

508
00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:29.970
like,
like the way he looks like he's like a bulldog.
Yeah.
Well no,
it's like,

509
00:27:29.971 --> 00:27:32.460
it looks like like a fucking,
like a comic book Superhero.

510
00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:35.970
Isn't it weird that it's kind of,
it's like,
like on the,

511
00:27:35.971 --> 00:27:40.020
on the fence of being racist.
Kind of like if you bring up,
you know,

512
00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:43.050
there's an incredible Ari gold,
ah,
oh,
they've African,

513
00:27:43.051 --> 00:27:46.370
you bring up the African American athlete is like,

514
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:49.320
just takes over all sports is like,
you know what,
I can talk about that.

515
00:27:49.321 --> 00:27:52.080
A guys who look like guys like Phil Davis and John Jones,

516
00:27:52.081 --> 00:27:54.540
they work fucking incredibly hard.

517
00:27:54.541 --> 00:27:58.230
This is not just a matter of guys who are just genetically gifted and they don't

518
00:27:58.231 --> 00:28:01.300
have to try.
No,
no.
They're there until the Dana Bowl.

519
00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:04.680
Both those guys have in common besides being black and besides being super

520
00:28:04.681 --> 00:28:07.470
athletes as they're both super fucking driven.

521
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:12.240
They work really hard and they're both really intelligent guys who know what

522
00:28:12.241 --> 00:28:13.950
they have to do and go throughout and didn't do it.

523
00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:16.680
So that when anybody questions what they've done to get where they are,

524
00:28:16.681 --> 00:28:18.390
they're like,
well fuck you.
You know you don't,

525
00:28:18.391 --> 00:28:21.150
you don't have no idea how much work I put in.
This is not easy,

526
00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:25.470
but they're still better at it than other people.
I mean,
yeah,
it's just,
yeah,

527
00:28:25.471 --> 00:28:29.250
it's like they got,
they got the,
all the ingredients you can't have,

528
00:28:29.251 --> 00:28:32.740
you can't be a natural gifted athlete and not work hard.
That's not good enough.

529
00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:33.631
You've got to have both.

530
00:28:33.631 --> 00:28:37.950
You got to work hard and that the edge is the natural stuff is the edge.

531
00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.410
I'm no super athlete,
but when I was doing taekwondo,

532
00:28:40.411 --> 00:28:43.860
I know there was certain people that I had physical advantages over there were

533
00:28:43.861 --> 00:28:48.090
undeniable.
Just having larger bones for my size,
being able to hit harder.

534
00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:51.340
You know,
there's certain certain things that you,
you there underneath.

535
00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:53.880
Isn't that weird how it's kind of racist to talk about that?

536
00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:56.040
She could talk about it myself though because I'm Italian.

537
00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.410
But you know Joey Diaz was talking to me about this on the,

538
00:28:58.411 --> 00:29:01.890
on the phone the other day.
He's like,
Yo family though.
Fucking masons,

539
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:03.840
masons from Italy.
Those guineas,

540
00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:06.540
those guineas make good masons cause everybody else tapped out.

541
00:29:06.541 --> 00:29:09.210
Everybody else just like,
fuck this.
I'm not carrying rocks.
The guineas like,

542
00:29:09.211 --> 00:29:13.530
fuck you,
I'll carry these fucking rocks.
And that's what it,
I mean it's,
it's no,

543
00:29:13.531 --> 00:29:16.520
no different in a racist way.
Then the idea that,
you know,

544
00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.980
African Americans were at one point in time slaves and they were bred to be

545
00:29:19.981 --> 00:29:23.190
larger and stronger.
You know,
why is that?
Why is that racist?

546
00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:27.810
Is that people got fired?
Uh,
Jimmy,
absolutely.
Isn't that like been a proven fact?

547
00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:32.320
Is it,
is it a proven fact?
I don't know.
It's like it's actually kind of racist.

548
00:29:32.321 --> 00:29:33.141
You can't bring,
yeah,

549
00:29:33.141 --> 00:29:37.140
it's totally racist to say that they have the fucking greatest bodies of all

550
00:29:37.141 --> 00:29:41.860
time.
Why is that?
I wish just to say they're the greatest athletes ever.

551
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.410
<v 1>Michael Jordan.
I mean,
could you stop?</v>

552
00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:48.220
Fuck is a greater athlete than Michael Jordan.
You remember when we were kids,

553
00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:52.180
he used to see those pictures of him flying through the fucking air.

554
00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:55.990
What was the last time a white guy was flying through the air and a basketball

555
00:29:55.991 --> 00:29:59.710
game like that?
I mean,
he could fly,
he'll eat.

556
00:29:59.711 --> 00:30:02.710
You remember those photos in sports illustrated?
We you like,

557
00:30:02.711 --> 00:30:06.460
there's no way that's real.
There's no way that guy's that high in the air.

558
00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:11.110
He could fly.
It's,
it's,
it's like a,
it's the reason it's like,

559
00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:13.443
it's they think,

560
00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:18.310
I think the people that think it's racist see it as when they say,

561
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:22.030
if you bring it up,
it's almost like,
yeah,
you're a better athlete.

562
00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:26.370
But you know,
it was because we are,
when you run out of Maine,
it's a direct,

563
00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:29.560
you know what I mean?
It's that kind of feel like it's,
well,
I could see that.

564
00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:33.580
Yeah.
All my relatives are from,
from Italy and Ireland,

565
00:30:33.581 --> 00:30:36.340
so nobody owned anybody in my family.
So I don't have any,

566
00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:39.190
might pay half black Gerald.
Well,
I'm mostly Sicilian.

567
00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:43.610
So if you follow the movie true romance,
there's a lot of black in my past,

568
00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:46.030
that sense of beauty.
You know what,
if I could,
if I could,
uh,

569
00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:50.140
had a time machine and I can go back and I could like mess with parallel

570
00:30:50.141 --> 00:30:51.450
dimensions and Universes,

571
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:55.420
I would choose a life where I was in a world where all the Mexicans were

572
00:30:55.421 --> 00:30:58.690
enslaved.
I,
they got created PR like amazing athletes.

573
00:30:58.691 --> 00:31:02.860
And then I was a by product of that.
I would like for me right now,

574
00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:04.990
I think that would be a,
that's a cool background,
right?

575
00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:09.970
Like people were enslaved,
you know,
for me,
I don't understand that.
Like,
you know,

576
00:31:09.971 --> 00:31:13.000
cause I'm not black so they have a whole different feelings.

577
00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:14.740
I think if I go back into my history,

578
00:31:14.741 --> 00:31:17.470
if I can get a time machine and go back to the history of my Dna,

579
00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.480
I think a long evolution,
you know,

580
00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:22.660
if evolution is real and if one point in time we were actually lower hominids

581
00:31:22.661 --> 00:31:24.940
and we evolved to become humans and these hairless apes,

582
00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:27.730
I think there must be stages along the way.
You know?

583
00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:31.060
And I think at one point in time,
one of my great,

584
00:31:31.061 --> 00:31:34.660
great and sensors fucked a monkey probably shouldn't have been fucking anymore.

585
00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:37.930
You know what I mean?
It was like one crazy McGee.

586
00:31:37.931 --> 00:31:39.160
There's probably going to die out.

587
00:31:39.161 --> 00:31:42.930
One crazy wild monkey and this more evolved monkey was like God damn,

588
00:31:42.931 --> 00:31:46.840
but I am horny and he shot a load of the crazy monkey and that monkey became

589
00:31:46.841 --> 00:31:50.950
like this hybrid and that's where I,
that's my genetic lineage.

590
00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.720
I definitely came from,

591
00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:56.920
I definitely have a just a hair more monkey in them than the regular person.

592
00:31:57.070 --> 00:32:00.520
There's no doubt about it.
There's no doubt about it.
I mean if,
if we,

593
00:32:00.521 --> 00:32:03.820
if you look at evolution,
you know,
you look at like evolve people,

594
00:32:03.821 --> 00:32:06.970
you know who looks evolved to me.
Asian people do Asian people,

595
00:32:06.971 --> 00:32:09.670
they have less hair.
They're fucking awesome at math.

596
00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:12.640
They're incredibly hard workers.
You know,
they're talking about having these,

597
00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:13.630
these,
they're going to have this,

598
00:32:13.631 --> 00:32:17.440
this thing in Japan where the nuclear power plants have melted down.
Dude,

599
00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:21.850
a bunch of people more than 50 are going to die for sure cause they went in

600
00:32:21.851 --> 00:32:25.030
there to clean that shit up.
Like they sacrificed themselves.

601
00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:30.400
That shit would never happen if with my people,
anybody in my family,

602
00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:34.300
anybody with my genetics,
that's not happening.
My culture,
this is not happening.

603
00:32:34.301 --> 00:32:35.134
We're not going to do that.

604
00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:40.040
Who's the Japanese to me that seems to be the most of all.
So that's against me

605
00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:45.890
<v 3>and,
and I think I'm closer to a monkey then</v>

606
00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:49.320
<v 0>these people are,
I'm a racist against myself.
Speaking of fucking animals,</v>

607
00:32:49.321 --> 00:32:53.160
have you seen that vice guide to like where they,
they fucked donkey's?
Yes.

608
00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:55.050
In Colombia.
Holy Shit.

609
00:32:55.440 --> 00:33:00.100
That I didn't think they would actually show it or show like a 12 year old shows

610
00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:03.630
trolling if they're trolling us.
It was all,
I don't get in trouble.

611
00:33:03.631 --> 00:33:06.750
They'd be in trouble at ready when that does.
The 12 year old goes like,

612
00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:11.500
I like to spread the pink pussy a part in it.
I love the fuck.

613
00:33:11.501 --> 00:33:15.390
Did Donkey policy like on keys?
Yeah.
It's so disturbing.

614
00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:19.490
Who are the jerseys?
Get Colombians.
The catch these guys fucking donkeys.

615
00:33:19.491 --> 00:33:21.210
And it's like,
there's a whole bunch of them talking,
talking.

616
00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:23.610
So I came in cold in this part of Columbia.

617
00:33:23.611 --> 00:33:26.760
If there's people fucking animals anywhere it's happening in all cultures.

618
00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:30.360
Would this part of Columbia,
it's,
it's kind of well known in their,

619
00:33:30.361 --> 00:33:35.070
in their society that uh,
your first,
uh,
sax is with a donkey.

620
00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:37.410
Like it's normal.
Like how weird is it

621
00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:41.770
<v 3>that that is going on the exact same time your neighborhood is going on or your</v>

622
00:33:41.771 --> 00:33:43.840
neighborhood is going on.
You know what I'm saying?
Like you know,

623
00:33:43.841 --> 00:33:47.410
you think this is all happening at the same time on this planet.

624
00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.800
There's parts of this planet that are in a totally different frequency than we

625
00:33:50.801 --> 00:33:51.910
are right here.
Yeah.

626
00:33:51.911 --> 00:33:55.810
If I lived in Columbia in some third world country or like that,

627
00:33:55.811 --> 00:34:00.460
I'd probably be fucking a donkey every now
fuck it.
What else is there to do?

628
00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:04.870
It's probably not enough checks.
All the good ones get taken up by the dictators.

629
00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.370
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
They all get the best ones.

630
00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:11.710
They get swooped up to imagine how much it must suck to be born into some really

631
00:34:11.711 --> 00:34:15.490
fucking crazy little small country that's super poured as dirt roads and you

632
00:34:15.491 --> 00:34:18.350
don't even realize how fucked up everything is until one day you'd go somewhere,

633
00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:22.600
there's a TV and he look at the TV and you see like Manhattan and Shit and

634
00:34:22.601 --> 00:34:26.320
buildings and skyscrapers and people eaten dinner and juicy steaks.
You're like,

635
00:34:26.321 --> 00:34:29.650
what the fuck?
Like where's all this happening?
And you're,

636
00:34:29.651 --> 00:34:31.590
you're stuck with no shoes on your,

637
00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:34.450
you get your shoes are made out of water bottles.
You ever seen those kids?

638
00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:40.180
They make flip flops at a water bottle.
That shit.
Yeah,
that's going on right now,

639
00:34:40.181 --> 00:34:41.740
man.
Going on right now in the world.

640
00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:44.120
<v 0>They also said that in that documented that there was like,</v>

641
00:34:44.121 --> 00:34:47.390
sometimes there's like that one slutty donkey that's just walking around the

642
00:34:47.391 --> 00:34:48.280
streets and he's like,

643
00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:52.890
and then sometimes I was so horny I would not even use a condom and now fuck the

644
00:34:52.910 --> 00:34:56.690
neighborhood donkey sluts.
Jesus Christ,
you know,

645
00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:01.520
she fucking cheaper Reeves is a huge,
you know she fucking,
yeah,
yeah,

646
00:35:01.521 --> 00:35:02.091
I remember that.

647
00:35:02.091 --> 00:35:07.091
She Vagina pit mockumentary never even close to that get made.

648
00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:12.410
What was it?
Well we were talking about sheep vagina,
like maybe she puts,

649
00:35:12.411 --> 00:35:14.030
he's like way better than regular pussy.

650
00:35:14.031 --> 00:35:16.730
Like it's supposed to be now it's supposed to,

651
00:35:16.731 --> 00:35:18.810
she puts these supposed to be like wait,

652
00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:21.260
like as realistic to a real pussy as possible.

653
00:35:21.261 --> 00:35:25.190
But it gets so good and the bid is,
it gets so boring muscular.
It's a 20,

654
00:35:25.191 --> 00:35:29.240
20 mockumentary like,
like this is already what's happening.
Put,
she puts,

655
00:35:29.241 --> 00:35:32.450
you are so good that it leaked into the city.
People started sneaking it,

656
00:35:32.451 --> 00:35:34.220
you know,
living with sheep and the city and it got,

657
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:38.430
it got to be a big problem and everyone's fucking sheep and um,

658
00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:43.440
that's it.
Have,
you know,
there was like violent murders and stuff.
There was,

659
00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:46.070
remembers,
Oh,
there was a sheet problem that wasn't sheep's.

660
00:35:46.071 --> 00:35:48.750
Sheep's would start murdering other sheeps.
Yeah,
because they could,

661
00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:50.700
if they smell get jealous,
they feel great.

662
00:35:50.701 --> 00:35:54.570
They felt were way better than a female vagina.
So everyone's into it.

663
00:35:54.571 --> 00:35:57.660
Everyone loves their sheep.
Everyone's got sheep at their houses.
Everyone's got,

664
00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:02.490
but if you cheat on your sheep,
if they smell sheep on you,
they'll attack you in,

665
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:04.770
in like each a dick and just kill you.

666
00:36:04.771 --> 00:36:08.920
Like on like a chimpanzee dude's got murdered and it's becoming a problem and

667
00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:11.950
there's a line sheet vagina.
And they had,
we had sheep,
sheep,

668
00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.100
gang war with a sheep would go into the next door,

669
00:36:14.101 --> 00:36:18.330
neighbors and fucking house and killed her.
She,
but if he had to fuck one animal,

670
00:36:18.331 --> 00:36:21.840
what's,
what's kind of animal would you,
you would do it.
Just go with the flow,

671
00:36:21.841 --> 00:36:25.740
man.
He figured it out.
You know what I mean?
All that shit.

672
00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:29.940
Giraffe.
No,
no,
no,

673
00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:34.050
not worth it.
But suddenly on sheep for some reasons,
a reason,

674
00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:35.760
let them do the groundwork.

675
00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:40.440
I believe in this and if they tell you that those peppers or hot,
trust me,

676
00:36:40.441 --> 00:36:41.370
it's cause somebody ate them.

677
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:44.430
You wouldn't go to Joey just discovering that he just started fucking sheet

678
00:36:44.431 --> 00:36:47.570
pussy and he's like telling you how great it is.
Listen,
cock sock of that.
Forget.

679
00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:51.360
Forget that fucking fleshlight.
Whatever that nonsense is.
Listen to me sheep.

680
00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:55.380
There's a reason why those fucking pharmas and month Montana and up then Beaut,

681
00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:58.270
those dudes would let them faces.
Looks like fucking catches them.

682
00:36:58.271 --> 00:37:01.500
It's smoking Marlboro's and fucking sheep dog all day long.

683
00:37:01.501 --> 00:37:04.050
That's what they're doing and those guys,
they know about New York.
They go,

684
00:37:04.051 --> 00:37:08.680
fuck you.
I don't want to leave.
I'm good.
I'm good.
I got my refund.
I got my sheet.

685
00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:12.090
I'm going to shoot a fucking bear this afternoon.
Listen got stuck up.

686
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:13.770
She puts the,
it's where it's at.

687
00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:18.000
They got it right to live in by streams while we hear like fucking animals in

688
00:37:18.001 --> 00:37:23.001
Burbank took me an hour in traffic traffic dog to get the fucking la.

689
00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:27.450
It ain't right.
It ain't right.
That guy's got a nail.

690
00:37:27.451 --> 00:37:31.890
These fucking sheep smoking joints from his mouth,
the gods he is.

691
00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:35.460
I think I would go crazy and fuck a dolphin if I had to choose or just go really

692
00:37:35.461 --> 00:37:39.150
crazy and fucked like Mcdonald's or like a bullfrog dolphins.

693
00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:42.150
The dolphins going to fuck you son.
Okay.
No,

694
00:37:42.151 --> 00:37:46.580
I'm saying so ladies and a hundred pounds.
Any animal muscle.

695
00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:49.320
I'm saying any animal like like you could have a tiger if you wanted to.

696
00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:50.890
They would like sedated enough,
get it,

697
00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:55.700
you know some roof roofie and date rape but tiger,
that's dolphin.

698
00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:57.720
The date rape,
any animals is what I'm saying.

699
00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:02.010
Because a dolphin what you would actually have like a spiritual connection.

700
00:38:02.011 --> 00:38:06.840
There are still some hard enemy.
Slimy or shipped often in the eye and like,
yeah,

701
00:38:06.841 --> 00:38:09.990
like you could actually fall in love with it doesn't always fucking tricks for

702
00:38:09.991 --> 00:38:14.050
you.
It sucks your Dick for from the sardines.
You're like,
Holy Shit.

703
00:38:14.051 --> 00:38:19.040
I'd often sucking Dick would be
moist.
That don't have water.

704
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:24.040
You're barely feeling the teeth.
Oh,
careful Mr Golfing.

705
00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:28.940
You could fuck him and he can take you for a ride.
You know,

706
00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:32.550
giving you a gentle dolphin,
blowjob,
but those giant in scissors,

707
00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:35.980
all the crazy people on this planet.
You know there's one fucking

708
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:40.930
<v 1>dude that worked at seaworld.
Tried to let the dog and suck his dick.
Come on.</v>

709
00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.130
There's got to be one or two.

710
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:45.640
I think by the time I was 2011 all you have to do is think about it.

711
00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:48.760
If you think about it and say,
we think someone's ever fucked a dolphin apps,

712
00:38:48.761 --> 00:38:52.270
a fucking,
if you can think about it,
it's been done a thousand times.

713
00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:55.380
Do a youtube video of that.
That'd be amazing.
Well,
they would pull it down.

714
00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:58.240
Those pussies,
they'd have to put it on foreign.
Highly emotion

715
00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:03.510
beastiality you would have would happen.
That's illegal,
right?

716
00:39:03.511 --> 00:39:05.890
Have to be hosted in another country.
It would have to,
it's illegal.

717
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:10.360
Can Fbi come to your house if you're watching animals?
Get Jack.
Well I don't,

718
00:39:10.361 --> 00:39:13.630
I think federally it's illegal,
but statewise he did.

719
00:39:13.631 --> 00:39:17.350
The weird thing with state's laws is that's how that movies got made.

720
00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:22.270
In some states it's still legal.
The fuck animal and let animals,
dude,

721
00:39:22.271 --> 00:39:26.170
can you imagine getting busted by the FBI for having all this like beastiality

722
00:39:26.171 --> 00:39:28.000
porn.
But um,

723
00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:32.410
but like how many guys out there were like fighting it?
Like this was a joke.

724
00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:36.370
This made me laugh.
I wasn't into it.
All the people that downloaded it,
I don't,

725
00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:39.700
yeah,
like they don't think you go to jail.
If you download it,
you go to jail.

726
00:39:39.701 --> 00:39:43.270
If you put it online and have it on a wall,
if you downloaded it,

727
00:39:43.271 --> 00:39:46.300
I'm going to jail because you can always say,
man,
your honor.

728
00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:47.740
We went thought this was hilarious.

729
00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.930
My buddies are watching all the time when I laughing.

730
00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.480
I don't think as long as it's a victimless crime,

731
00:39:52.481 --> 00:39:54.520
as long as it's looks like it's a grown adult,

732
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:57.460
I don't think that you get in trouble for that.
I think it's,
you're not,

733
00:39:57.490 --> 00:39:59.230
you're not supposed to be in possession of it,

734
00:39:59.231 --> 00:40:01.930
but I don't think you would ask that.
There's gotta be a website,
like who?

735
00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:05.650
Like who,
you know,
if you think you fucked like the craziest,
weirdest creature,

736
00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:09.650
put it online and have a judge and probably us.
It's got to be a contest.

737
00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:15.220
Like fucking every single breed of dog or the wildest animal.

738
00:40:15.231 --> 00:40:18.280
If you can get up on his polar bear,
you know,

739
00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:19.850
anytime you figure it out and me tag,

740
00:40:19.851 --> 00:40:21.940
there's any sort of a controversial thing like this.

741
00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:24.190
The FBI will infiltrate these fucking dude.

742
00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:27.630
Dude can't imagine if they want to fuck animal.
It's like,
well,
you know it,

743
00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:31.540
you know?
Right.
When the dice going to sneak out and there's a donkey freeze,

744
00:40:31.541 --> 00:40:34.780
FBI motherfucker,
you got me this donkey.

745
00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:38.530
It's like an American idol thing so you could fuck the craziest animal.

746
00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:41.990
What are you talking about?
[inaudible] what do you think about setups like that?

747
00:40:41.991 --> 00:40:43.980
Like dogs wouldn't even be in the ballpark here.

748
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:46.960
Then people would get into like try to get bears and shit.
You know what I mean?

749
00:40:46.961 --> 00:40:49.330
The oddest ones.
Trying to get like a hippopotamus

750
00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:55.810
rope around his neck due to there was a $5 million grant,

751
00:40:55.840 --> 00:41:00.180
American idol prize seek or [inaudible] video,

752
00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:06.510
$5 million we would need is a couple of nuclear meltdowns in this country.
Lower,

753
00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:10.010
lower the price of life.
And then for sure that could be a real show.

754
00:41:10.011 --> 00:41:15.011
It can fuck the craziest animal next on spike after the top 196 top season 196

755
00:41:19.241 --> 00:41:22.380
because you know what,
that is still the UFC heavyweight champion.

756
00:41:22.381 --> 00:41:25.180
Cause now they have genetic engineering and he's fucking 200 years old.

757
00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:27.700
But take the first year during a Koala bear,

758
00:41:27.701 --> 00:41:30.340
first year they wouldn't get the crazy wild animal.
They have to build it.

759
00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:33.010
They'd have to build like by the third and fourth season.
You know what I,

760
00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.670
they're getting crazier and crazier.

761
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:38.900
Like the craziest would be like a fucking killer whale.
So realistically,

762
00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:42.800
realistically there's not much difference between the human beings have today

763
00:41:42.801 --> 00:41:46.700
and the human beings that we're having people fight tigers in the Roman empire

764
00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:48.350
were the same fucking people.

765
00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:53.440
The only thing is that we've managed to not have a giant natural disaster

766
00:41:53.751 --> 00:41:55.220
between then and now.

767
00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:58.730
So we've accumulated a bunch of data on how you shouldn't act.

768
00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:02.030
That's the only reason why we don't have people fighting tigers in the middle of

769
00:42:02.031 --> 00:42:05.210
a fucking arena today.
Cause if somebody put it out today,
we would,

770
00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.830
there would be a bunch of people that would be into it.

771
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:08.840
And if anything ever happened to the people today,

772
00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:13.610
if there was some fucking asteroid impact that killed off half of us and that

773
00:42:13.611 --> 00:42:14.341
people survive,

774
00:42:14.341 --> 00:42:18.440
it was all fucking chaos and may for sure within a hundred years people would be

775
00:42:18.441 --> 00:42:21.950
fighting tigers in a,
in an arena.
Again,
it would start all over again.
When,

776
00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:26.450
what year did they get that bad?
How did that come about?
Cause they had,

777
00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:28.910
they had to come a point in time where they're like,
dude,

778
00:42:28.911 --> 00:42:33.380
we can't be having it all died off.
You know,
the empire died off it.
That's the,

779
00:42:33.381 --> 00:42:36.560
that was the,
I mean I think probably today somewhere,

780
00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:40.190
if you've got enough money you can get a dude to fight a tiger.
You know,

781
00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:44.120
I think I was at,
was it the fall of the Roman Empire?
Yeah.
Yeah.

782
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.961
Definitely didn't have it.

783
00:42:44.961 --> 00:42:48.410
They didn't like move it to Greece or I don't know what to England.
Why not?

784
00:42:48.411 --> 00:42:51.140
I think the Romans were the ones who were into the Colosseum and all the,
the,

785
00:42:51.141 --> 00:42:54.970
the,
the crazy fights that they would set up.
They must have been gangster,

786
00:42:55.090 --> 00:42:58.010
his family ever to take over.
You're the head of the Roman Empire.

787
00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:02.000
You're the fucking emperor of the greatest emp,
like ancient empire.

788
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:06.230
The Romans dominated all.
They smashed everybody and you're the emperor.

789
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:10.190
You're having fucking orgies.
You're having people fight lions in front of you.

790
00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:10.910
You know what I mean?

791
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:14.330
What that must have been like back then there was no internet,
no television,

792
00:43:14.331 --> 00:43:18.310
and this guy was the king of Rome by the ampere Everwell board as fuck.

793
00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:21.440
Stand up and he would fucking give speeches to the death.

794
00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:26.360
Was the words thousands of men raising their spears cheering for you.

795
00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:29.790
I bet that had something to do with getting elected like this motherfucker.

796
00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:31.850
He comes with the crazy shit.

797
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:35.360
At first it was the gladiators fighting each other that animals fighting
animals.

798
00:43:35.361 --> 00:43:39.110
Then guys fighting animals.
It's like that was like a new campaign to get.
Uh,

799
00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:43.520
and I think the whole royalty thing probably all started off because everybody

800
00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:47.450
wants to think that they're the man.
Everybody wants to think that you know,

801
00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.790
they could be the guy running shit.

802
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:52.010
If you think you're around like a regular dude,
you like,

803
00:43:52.011 --> 00:43:53.960
this dude isn't better than me.
I could be better than that guy.

804
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:55.820
That's like the classic male ego problem.

805
00:43:56.090 --> 00:43:59.120
But if you get someone who's elevated to the point of royalty,

806
00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:01.550
like you can't even question,
you can't get to know them.

807
00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:04.820
You are not allowed to get to know them so you never get the crack the puzzle.

808
00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:08.030
He can't be sitting right next to him going,
this mother fucker's crazy.

809
00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:11.900
You're running shit.
Why are you running shit?
Hey,
have your buddy get over here,

810
00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:14.990
this guy,
we'll call him the king.
This guy's a crazy ass hall.

811
00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:19.250
This guy's banging his daughters and he's fucking killing people for a goof and

812
00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:22.940
having his wives executed.
He's crazy.
We've got to stop letting him run.

813
00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:25.370
Shit we get,
he's just a regular person,
you know,

814
00:44:25.371 --> 00:44:28.060
but they never got a chance to say he's just a regular person.

815
00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:30.800
You can get close to him.
That's the only way a person can really rule.

816
00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:34.170
They have to rule as if there's something outside of the human race.

817
00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:35.520
They have to rule a deity.

818
00:44:35.521 --> 00:44:38.760
Do you have to rule like there a god they have to rule like there you can't even

819
00:44:38.761 --> 00:44:41.370
come close to them.
You got to get on your knees sire.

820
00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:43.230
Thank you for hearing my words.

821
00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:46.170
You know you had to get on your knees and not make eye contact with him and then

822
00:44:46.171 --> 00:44:50.610
when he put his hand out you would kiss it.
What the fuck?
It's like they,
they,

823
00:44:50.611 --> 00:44:53.820
you had to have that trick to keep,
to keep an empire together.

824
00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:56.460
You couldn't just be,
couldn't have access to information.

825
00:44:56.580 --> 00:45:00.180
It's like the ultimate example of how like those empires,

826
00:45:00.181 --> 00:45:03.230
like the more access to information,
the more you realize that the guy in charge,

827
00:45:03.231 --> 00:45:04.320
it's just fucking crazy.

828
00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:06.990
The less likely it is to be able to have something like that.

829
00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:10.140
That's why all these fucking empires are falling apart all over the world,
man.

830
00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:10.981
That's what Egypt,
why?

831
00:45:10.981 --> 00:45:14.130
What's going on in Egypt where Mubarak and while in Libya they're trying to get

832
00:45:14.131 --> 00:45:14.964
rid of Qaddafi.

833
00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:18.150
I mean I'm sure there's a bunch of American black ops involved as well.

834
00:45:18.151 --> 00:45:20.430
There's a bunch of CIA shit that you know,

835
00:45:20.431 --> 00:45:23.640
forcing these people out because they're probably sitting on a giant pool of
oil.

836
00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:26.700
You know what I have into it because information,

837
00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:27.750
because they're getting information.

838
00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:32.670
I haven't listened to the Alex Jones version of what's going on in a and M
Libya.

839
00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:35.310
I'm sure there's a whole different version.
I'm very interested in.

840
00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:39.210
I just haven't had time.
Alex.
I haven't heard it either.
I haven't heard either.

841
00:45:39.211 --> 00:45:42.630
I can't.
When shit is really happening,
when real shit has gone down.

842
00:45:42.631 --> 00:45:45.220
That's the last time I want to listen to Alex cause he'll get you distracted.

843
00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:46.480
<v 4>It's eugenics.</v>

844
00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:51.400
What they're doing right now is they've got blood but FEMA has black plastic

845
00:45:51.550 --> 00:45:54.700
coffins outside of Dallas.
I've seen them,
ladies and gentlemen,

846
00:45:54.701 --> 00:45:58.030
I have the photographs and there's 200 billion of them.

847
00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:00.700
They know there's not even 200 billion people,
so that's,

848
00:46:00.701 --> 00:46:04.600
we're talking clones now.
Clones of people life extension.

849
00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:08.230
We'll be right back by gold.
You need to buy gold ladies and gentlemen,

850
00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:13.150
2012 solar impact.
Gold will protect you.

851
00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:16.440
<v 1>I like that load.
We will be right back right back.
That was good.</v>

852
00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:19.460
That's what he does.
We'll be right back.
Folks that's slick and run the show.

853
00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:23.390
He's out of his fucking mind.
Alex Jones roles.
He's awesome.
He's awesome.

854
00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:25.550
But he's out of his mind.
He's a,

855
00:46:25.551 --> 00:46:28.910
I think Alex Jones is dead on the money like 70% of the time.

856
00:46:28.911 --> 00:46:30.440
That's what scares the shit out of me.

857
00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:33.080
All the crazy stuff that he throws in there.
I mean maybe he's right.

858
00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:34.400
I don't know.
It seems crazy in Maine,

859
00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:37.330
but the real stuff that he's dead on the money about,
it's,
it's,

860
00:46:37.331 --> 00:46:41.840
it's almost cheapened by all the other,
the,
the,
the Histrionics,
the craziness.

861
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:43.760
He knew what the,
with the Japan thing,

862
00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:48.260
he knew about those explosions like days before they would announce them.

863
00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:49.460
They were not admitting shit.

864
00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:52.030
He would get shit like somehow it could have been the lucky guy.

865
00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:58.020
<v 4>Let reactor four just blew out of that.
Damn.
I'm,
I got a one in six chance.</v>

866
00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:00.340
Oh Shit for him.

867
00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:05.980
<v 1>Yeah,
that's fine.
Alex,
you did it.
Well,
he,</v>

868
00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:10.250
he's a fucking news junkie and he has access to shit that other people don't

869
00:47:10.251 --> 00:47:13.690
know why he's still alive.
How come they haven't tried to kill him?
So powerful,

870
00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:15.830
man.
You don't even look.
You don't have to kill him for what?

871
00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:19.190
He's not stopping anything.
No one's stopping anything.
And you know what things,

872
00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.410
the things that get exposed,
they're supposed to get exposed.

873
00:47:21.530 --> 00:47:25.130
He's like the Perez Hilton of the fucking,
the,
the,
the political world.

874
00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:28.020
That's what it is.
It's like,
you know,
he's exposing shit that,

875
00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:29.980
you know what you fucked up anyway.
He shouldn't

876
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:31.630
<v 3>have been doing it this way anyway.
Stupid.
You know,</v>

877
00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:33.640
you know this is wrong and everybody has in government,

878
00:47:33.641 --> 00:47:35.800
it's not like everybody's evil in government,

879
00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:39.250
but there's a lot of fucking stupid poor choices that get made and the better

880
00:47:39.251 --> 00:47:41.530
they get exposed,
the better it is for everybody.

881
00:47:41.531 --> 00:47:44.740
Even the people that are governing the people they need to be checked too.

882
00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:47.860
It's not like everybody in government is evil.
They have to be evil.

883
00:47:47.861 --> 00:47:49.390
They don't necessarily have to be evil.

884
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:51.670
A lot of people go into government with good intentions,

885
00:47:51.671 --> 00:47:54.160
but along the way that gets stifled by corruption and bullshit.

886
00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:55.750
So this is all good for everybody.

887
00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:58.900
This is good for everybody when shit like this happens,
but the,

888
00:47:58.901 --> 00:48:01.480
some of the stuff that he says is terrifying.

889
00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:05.710
Like one thing that got passed by everybody that you never hear discuss was

890
00:48:05.711 --> 00:48:08.320
during the World Trade Organization meetings in Seattle.

891
00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:12.310
You remember those where the people were stopped from protesting.

892
00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.940
This is what happened.
There was peaceful protests.
It was a long time ago.

893
00:48:15.941 --> 00:48:16.530
I think it was like,

894
00:48:16.530 --> 00:48:19.290
I want to say 2001 but I'm just throwing out numbers at my house.

895
00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:21.780
I just pulled that out of my ass.
I think it was actually before that.
No,

896
00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:25.100
it was before that because it was before nine 11 it was quite a bit where that

897
00:48:25.101 --> 00:48:28.510
was.
The protesters were actually CIA guys.
Yeah.
Well the protesters were,

898
00:48:28.511 --> 00:48:31.090
were cops.
They were there were paid anarchists,

899
00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:35.590
they were people that were sent in to go in and cause chaos and break windows

900
00:48:35.591 --> 00:48:39.910
and SMA and they will warm ski masks and they all wore military issue boots and

901
00:48:39.911 --> 00:48:42.770
they weren't,
nobody knew them.
They weren't involved in the,

902
00:48:42.771 --> 00:48:43.780
the rest of the protest.

903
00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:48.100
The protest was peaceful and inconvenient because all these foreign delegates

904
00:48:48.101 --> 00:48:49.450
and all these people were coming,
you know,

905
00:48:49.451 --> 00:48:51.550
these are these representatives of foreign foreign countries.

906
00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:54.940
We're coming to that one place and to have all this protest around was

907
00:48:54.941 --> 00:48:58.360
embarrassing.
And it was disturbing and it was causing,
it was,
it was,
you know,

908
00:48:58.361 --> 00:48:59.320
causing a lot of press.

909
00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:01.390
Like they were having to answer a lot of questions about it.

910
00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:04.780
So they turned it into a violent display.

911
00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:08.320
They turned it into a vibey and they being the government,

912
00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:12.940
they came in with guys that were in military outfits and they would wear ski

913
00:49:12.941 --> 00:49:14.860
masks on and they broke windows and they smashed them.

914
00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:17.680
And Alex Jones documents every single aspect of it,

915
00:49:17.681 --> 00:49:21.970
including these guys going into a safe house and being allowed to,
uh,

916
00:49:21.971 --> 00:49:24.430
to negotiate eventually all being released.

917
00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:26.410
May he documents all of this and you know,

918
00:49:26.411 --> 00:49:28.820
he does it with news reports and he does it with,

919
00:49:28.821 --> 00:49:32.260
with video footage and it's pretty fucking crazy because what they did is they

920
00:49:32.261 --> 00:49:33.400
shut down a protest.

921
00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:37.300
They sent some fucking goons in and they shut down a protest and this isn't Nazi

922
00:49:37.301 --> 00:49:40.510
Germany.
This is in the Roman empire.
This is the United States of America.

923
00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:42.430
That's crazy.
It's fucking nuts.

924
00:49:42.431 --> 00:49:45.310
And it's 100% it's not like this is a conspiracy theory.

925
00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:49.660
They stopped people from walking through with things that said Wt.
Oh,

926
00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:54.130
with a red line on it.
How fucking UNAMERICAN is that?
Anything's possible.

927
00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:58.480
You're saying that you can't go in with a pin that says World Trade Organization

928
00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:02.530
that you're opposed to it.
You can't have an opinion that's not even offensive.

929
00:50:02.590 --> 00:50:05.770
It's not.
There's no swears,
no curse.
It's not something that would hurt children.

930
00:50:05.970 --> 00:50:06.701
You know,
you just have a,

931
00:50:06.701 --> 00:50:10.720
a WTO with a red line through and you're telling me I can't go to work.

932
00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:14.530
They could do,
wouldn't let people into buildings.
They had cops there with guns.

933
00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:16.480
There were telling people,
you have to take that shirt off,

934
00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:19.990
you have to take that pin off and they have videos of this fucking America.

935
00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:22.210
They dig,
created a no protest zone.

936
00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:24.760
So just for the stuff like that that Alex exposes,

937
00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:27.860
you know whether or not he's right about a missile hitting the or any of that

938
00:50:27.861 --> 00:50:28.040
other

939
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:29.300
<v 1>stuff.
Shit,
I don't know man.</v>

940
00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:32.120
It just not enough time in the world to be dwelling on all this shit.

941
00:50:32.310 --> 00:50:34.730
He's right about enough.
He's wrong about a couple of things.

942
00:50:34.731 --> 00:50:38.690
But if you're going to judge a guy based on like,
oh,
he was wrong about this,

943
00:50:38.691 --> 00:50:40.160
so he can't know anything else.

944
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:43.070
You know that none of us would have any opinions that mattered.

945
00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:45.920
He has fucked up a little bit here and there,
but man,

946
00:50:45.921 --> 00:50:50.810
I believe the shit he tells me I believe I'm confident with in the 90
percentile.

947
00:50:51.050 --> 00:50:54.390
I'm comfortable.
He's a fun guy too.
I enjoy his company.
He's a great guy.

948
00:50:54.391 --> 00:50:55.590
Like I love hanging out with her.
Yeah,

949
00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:59.330
it's pretty surreal hanging out on Alex Jones.
Right?
That's cool man.

950
00:50:59.331 --> 00:51:02.240
We took him to Vegas when we took him to the UFC.
He were all hanging out,

951
00:51:02.241 --> 00:51:06.560
having a good time.
You guys want,
I'm really happy.
Brought me out here to relax,

952
00:51:06.590 --> 00:51:08.720
you know,
find a new world order,
man.
It's fucking crazy.
You know,

953
00:51:08.721 --> 00:51:13.070
you hear not any to get a little crazy.
He's got a cigarette.
I love it.

954
00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:16.760
I love it cause all he,
he loves talking about all the,

955
00:51:16.761 --> 00:51:18.890
it's like he could go two ways.
You could be a guide.

956
00:51:18.891 --> 00:51:21.490
Like please don't talk about conspiracies like any writer,

957
00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:25.010
unless I was talking about normal city,
but no,
not Alex Jones.
He'll go,

958
00:51:25.070 --> 00:51:26.810
Donald Rumsfeld was the one who,

959
00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:31.580
he's the one who got that pass through to diet coke.
That's how it got in.
Yeah.

960
00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:34.960
Okay.
I feel bad for that stuff and to calm down,

961
00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:39.390
but he does hurt but does doesn't it?
That's him.
Yeah.
Let let him,
you know,

962
00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:40.950
you let you let him be him.

963
00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:44.450
Could you imagine if they made the Brian Red Band conspiracy show?
You'd be like,

964
00:51:44.451 --> 00:51:47.780
hey guys.
I mean,
who knows?
I don't know.
You know,

965
00:51:47.781 --> 00:51:50.420
why are we fucking freaking out about this?
All right.

966
00:51:50.421 --> 00:51:52.520
We'll be right back after these words for the fleshlight.

967
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:57.050
That'd be the Brian Red van conspiracy radio show.
He'd be like,

968
00:51:57.080 --> 00:52:00.710
I think we're all getting a little carried away here.
Okay.
We don't know shit.

969
00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:05.000
I don't know what's happening in Japan.
That's way the fuck over there.
Forget it.

970
00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:08.230
God.
Everybody relaxed.
That's you.

971
00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:14.680
Fema has 300,000 helicopters with beds and I'm ready to go.

972
00:52:14.781 --> 00:52:17.930
They can stay in the air for up to three days.
Okay.

973
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:22.430
Solar charged helicopters in case of an asteroid will impact.

974
00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:25.000
It's recommended that that he'll fucking,

975
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:29.360
they'll just fill your brain up every day with more information about doom and

976
00:52:29.361 --> 00:52:31.250
the apocalypse.
I love it.
I love it.

977
00:52:31.251 --> 00:52:32.960
I have so many questions he has answers to all.

978
00:52:32.961 --> 00:52:35.210
My craziest thing is he's always selling gold.

979
00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:39.500
I think that motherfucker just needs to step up and start selling gasoline and

980
00:52:39.501 --> 00:52:42.770
bullets.
Stop fucking around with this gold cause you know,

981
00:52:42.771 --> 00:52:45.590
if some shit goes down,
Gold's going to be useless.
All right?

982
00:52:45.591 --> 00:52:49.130
Unless the Annunaki land again and we've got to give them gold to let them take

983
00:52:49.131 --> 00:52:53.360
us aboard the UFO.
And unless that happens,
Gold's going to be used.
Gold is like,

984
00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:55.070
gee,
it's universal no matter what.

985
00:52:55.071 --> 00:52:58.280
And Mad Max Times gold is still going to be really,
yeah,
I think it is.

986
00:52:58.281 --> 00:53:01.040
No matter what.
That's the one thing we all agree on in this plant.

987
00:53:01.041 --> 00:53:04.280
We don't agree on Shit.
Every country,
even the same religion,

988
00:53:04.310 --> 00:53:07.160
it all depends on whether or not by the time the apocalypse hits,

989
00:53:07.161 --> 00:53:09.980
we've created artificial people.
If we created like,

990
00:53:10.210 --> 00:53:13.340
like whores artificial whores,
you know soulless,

991
00:53:13.341 --> 00:53:17.390
mindless robot whores that you could just fuck the shit out of you and they're

992
00:53:17.391 --> 00:53:21.110
so happy and they just shut off and wait for you to come back and when you come

993
00:53:21.111 --> 00:53:23.230
back they talk to you perfectly nearly.

994
00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:26.190
It's like it's just like blade runner except they don't have a soul.

995
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:28.360
<v 3>Why would they shut up?
They should be cleaning my house.</v>

996
00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:31.950
And you've got one of those too,
Bro.
You got to,
you got one.

997
00:53:32.010 --> 00:53:35.120
You got this crazy looking Tongan woman with face tattoos.

998
00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:38.970
She cleans your house slash.
Body,
but gee,
I wish you could.

999
00:53:38.971 --> 00:53:41.570
Can you fuck that robot?
No,
no.

1000
00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:45.150
You better off getting a dude house robot with no Dick,
a unit and unit.

1001
00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:50.100
He's built like he's built like the incredible hug downstairs.
It's like Ken,

1002
00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:53.580
I'm never going to have a guy's face is all fucked up.
It's just one.

1003
00:53:53.581 --> 00:53:55.190
I like one big cycle.
I was like,

1004
00:53:55.210 --> 00:53:58.170
there's no way to let girls know he's got three eyes.

1005
00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:01.320
He's got three eyes because you don't get to see everywhere so he could protect

1006
00:54:01.350 --> 00:54:04.200
you.
Imagine went in the first eight years to be your protector.

1007
00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:07.680
That's when technology ends.
Cause all the guys build in this shit.

1008
00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:08.480
They're going to have harems.

1009
00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:11.640
You think about the nerds of the world that going to have like 10 chicks around

1010
00:54:11.641 --> 00:54:12.330
them at all time.

1011
00:54:12.330 --> 00:54:16.290
They're going to be going on date after date after date for monkeys.
Who?

1012
00:54:16.291 --> 00:54:19.320
What monkey would ever think about having a pet dog.
They'd be like,

1013
00:54:19.321 --> 00:54:22.320
what the fuck he talking about?
You can't trust a dog.
They're going to kill you,

1014
00:54:22.321 --> 00:54:24.270
man.
You can't have a fucking pet duck.

1015
00:54:24.330 --> 00:54:26.490
How are you going to be able to control a dog?
Well,

1016
00:54:26.491 --> 00:54:28.290
when humans evolved to a certain point,

1017
00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:32.070
we'll be able to have like pet things that we've created.
Like pet monsters,

1018
00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:35.790
like pet,
like your,
your house will be guarded by like superheroes.

1019
00:54:35.791 --> 00:54:37.500
Like juggernaut will guard your house,

1020
00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:42.330
you'll have your own genetically engineered man.
Way better than a robot.
Fuck on.

1021
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:44.100
Never sleeps.
Robotic Trump

1022
00:54:46.290 --> 00:54:49.710
leaps over buildings and plans on shit trying to break into my house.
Bitch,

1023
00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:53.730
superheroes,
gardeners,
you crack head crack head with a screwdriver.

1024
00:54:53.731 --> 00:54:56.450
You're going to get past the superhero.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1025
00:54:56.460 --> 00:55:01.280
Well I am so fascinated by what the fuck ever is going to happen when,

1026
00:55:01.281 --> 00:55:02.700
when things keep going.
You know,

1027
00:55:02.701 --> 00:55:07.701
I watch all those ray Kurt's wheel lectures and I've read some of his papers and

1028
00:55:07.711 --> 00:55:11.250
some of his articles about the singularity and the idea of artificial

1029
00:55:11.251 --> 00:55:16.050
intelligence and it's all going to happen.
We're not going to stop.
I mean we,

1030
00:55:16.051 --> 00:55:20.190
we've created so much between now and just a couple hundred years ago.

1031
00:55:20.191 --> 00:55:23.760
The difference between our life now and like I was watching the unforgiven the

1032
00:55:23.761 --> 00:55:26.730
other day on a plane.
Still bad ass bro.

1033
00:55:26.731 --> 00:55:31.680
Still bad ass from like 1990 whatever the fuck it was.
That movie is awesome.

1034
00:55:31.681 --> 00:55:34.650
The Clint Eastwood is the Shit,
especially in that movie.

1035
00:55:34.651 --> 00:55:36.660
That's the best western movie ever,

1036
00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:40.530
but I looked at the way these fucking people were living in.
I'm like,
my God,

1037
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:42.690
that's less than 200 years ago.

1038
00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:47.640
Less than 200 years ago and they're riding horses and getting rained on and shit

1039
00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:50.370
and they're going to these places and the houses are made a wooden,

1040
00:55:50.371 --> 00:55:52.110
they're leaking like crazy because of the rain.

1041
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:54.300
They didn't even know how to make rooves right back then.

1042
00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:56.520
It's just this just too,
you know,

1043
00:55:56.540 --> 00:55:59.760
that's probably also just like dramatic scenes in a movie,

1044
00:55:59.761 --> 00:56:02.610
don't you think back then if you had a leaky roof,
like you'd be on that thing,

1045
00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:05.910
you know in Hackman and not gene Hackman,
the sheriff,

1046
00:56:05.911 --> 00:56:09.000
he didn't know what the fuck is nothing else to do and they get working internet

1047
00:56:09.001 --> 00:56:10.620
to fucking bother.
He's like,
oh,
I have a leaky roof.

1048
00:56:10.690 --> 00:56:14.340
Ios right now going to tell us part of the character development of Gene Hackman

1049
00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:17.760
who supposed to be incompetent but yet cocky and that was the whole reason why

1050
00:56:17.761 --> 00:56:22.320
it was so satisfying.
The cleanness would killed him in the end.
Okay Dude,
I know,

1051
00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:25.380
I know.
We're just having fun here.
You fucks.
You would.

1052
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:30.220
Wouldn't you think that like Mcdonald Douglas or like one of those come a Hughes

1053
00:56:30.221 --> 00:56:34.480
aircraft for some would be like involved in the number one product on the planet

1054
00:56:34.481 --> 00:56:38.810
would be like a real person that you could find control you control.

1055
00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:42.700
That would be the ultimate robot that looked the best robot would look exactly

1056
00:56:42.701 --> 00:56:44.710
human.
Could you imagine if you had just,

1057
00:56:44.830 --> 00:56:49.830
you know you had a robot woman in your house and you come home and your wife

1058
00:56:49.901 --> 00:56:53.740
like lit it on fire.
It was fucking it.
Oh yeah,

1059
00:56:53.741 --> 00:56:58.120
she's having a year asshole he'd come in with was fucking robots.
Press tanks.

1060
00:56:59.510 --> 00:57:03.580
We've got to change shit shitting and that thing's mouth while you're at work,

1061
00:57:03.810 --> 00:57:04.170
you come,

1062
00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:07.660
well she's coughing and your robots coughing and choking and she got shit caked

1063
00:57:07.661 --> 00:57:10.780
in her mouth.
Like what the fuck have you been doing?
I shit in her mouth.

1064
00:57:10.810 --> 00:57:13.660
Can you imagine the first robots and robot horn?
My house,

1065
00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:15.040
I'm going to shit in her mouth every day.

1066
00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:17.980
You wouldn't even feel bad cause it's not a real person.
You know,

1067
00:57:17.981 --> 00:57:20.380
if you were shitting in like your slaves mouth,
you'd be like,
wow,

1068
00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:23.710
that's kinda rude.
But dudes,

1069
00:57:25.070 --> 00:57:29.100
dudes get transvestite robots.
Oh Shit.
You know what I read the other day that's,

1070
00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:30.880
I need to verify this.
Of course.

1071
00:57:30.881 --> 00:57:34.170
Cause every time I don't verify something that I've read,
people go corrupt,

1072
00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:38.520
there's information,
I get somebody angry,
tweets,
relax,
everybody would lax.

1073
00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:43.620
But this is what I read that more people are in the sex slaves today than were

1074
00:57:44.051 --> 00:57:48.640
slaves back when slavery was legal.
How crazy is that?

1075
00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:52.090
My second one of those numbers,
the more people are sex late,
we should,

1076
00:57:52.091 --> 00:57:53.950
we could sue should.
That's one of those numbers too is like,

1077
00:57:53.951 --> 00:57:56.290
how the fuck did they know?
Yeah,
right.
You know,
I mean,

1078
00:57:56.291 --> 00:57:59.260
sex slaves live in basements and they can only come out when they,

1079
00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:02.980
they're hungry for cock.
You know,
it's like,
who counts that guy?

1080
00:58:03.250 --> 00:58:07.410
Or they just guesstimating that f every block that sex they figure out.

1081
00:58:08.090 --> 00:58:10.610
I think they do it the same way they do about,
um,

1082
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:15.010
Mexicans just take a wild guess.
They don't know.

1083
00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:17.800
You know,
I go,
no,
they don't have any idea.

1084
00:58:17.890 --> 00:58:20.610
They have no idea how many Mexicans or there's just sneaking in here,

1085
00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:23.920
left and right.
My Gardener,
I shouldn't say this,
I can't,
I can't ride them out.

1086
00:58:24.110 --> 00:58:28.270
You know,
I've got a cool house gardener and he knows a bunch of illegals.

1087
00:58:28.271 --> 00:58:30.730
He's legal himself,
but he knows a bunch of illegals.

1088
00:58:30.970 --> 00:58:34.450
He's got some great stories about dude's going back and forth and it took him a

1089
00:58:34.451 --> 00:58:39.310
few tries,
but he came back.
They don't know.
They don't know.

1090
00:58:39.311 --> 00:58:39.880
Man.

1091
00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:43.360
This dude's going back and forth is a fucking three guys in Arizona with white

1092
00:58:43.361 --> 00:58:47.560
pickup trucks trying to guard a million miles of fence.
Good luck boys.

1093
00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:49.090
You're on your own.
Good luck.

1094
00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:52.030
You know how many fucking Mexicans get through there and it's crazy.

1095
00:58:52.031 --> 00:58:56.080
A lot of them do.
It came to this country illegally.

1096
00:58:56.081 --> 00:58:59.180
He snuck over the border.
How became the last?
It was dad's store.

1097
00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:04.300
He walked all the way to like Sacramento twice.
That's craziness.

1098
00:59:04.650 --> 00:59:06.430
That was picking grapes I think it was.

1099
00:59:06.670 --> 00:59:08.710
It was actually a Oxnard or something like that.

1100
00:59:08.770 --> 00:59:13.660
That's a lot of mother fucking walk all fucked up.
He's apparently all fucked up.

1101
00:59:14.650 --> 00:59:17.760
Yeah.
I think maybe took rides everywhere.
They watched it.
They had some one show.

1102
00:59:17.770 --> 00:59:21.560
They watched his family sneak across the border and they followed them from

1103
00:59:21.561 --> 00:59:25.940
sneaking across the border to trying to get someone to take them in in Phoenix.

1104
00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:29.570
They were trying to get someone to let them sleep in the garage for the night

1105
00:59:29.610 --> 00:59:32.510
because they had just snuck in and now people like,
man,
you can't be here,

1106
00:59:32.511 --> 00:59:34.250
you can't be here.
Like,
and they were talking Spanish to them.

1107
00:59:34.251 --> 00:59:35.084
It was really crazy.

1108
00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:38.840
It was like these Mexicans that had had snuck through did not want these guys

1109
00:59:38.841 --> 00:59:41.270
that hadn't to be staying in the garage.

1110
00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:43.820
They just wanted a place to sleep for the night before they,
uh,

1111
00:59:43.821 --> 00:59:45.070
they manage to town and they were like,

1112
00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:47.930
they were literally like going into knocking on people's doors,
can you help us?

1113
00:59:47.931 --> 00:59:51.200
They didn't have anything.
He had no food.
They had no money.
Like wow,

1114
00:59:51.370 --> 00:59:55.460
you talk about taking chances and it was really moving man.
Like this couple,

1115
00:59:55.461 --> 00:59:57.260
this man,
this woman there holding hands and they're,

1116
00:59:57.261 --> 01:00:00.160
they're trying to get across to America and try to get jobs and they're,

1117
01:00:00.290 --> 01:00:01.880
you know,
talking to them in Spanish about,
you know,

1118
01:00:01.881 --> 01:00:04.580
what they're looking forward to when they go into America and you know,

1119
01:00:04.610 --> 01:00:06.920
trying to make some money and they're going to send money back home.

1120
01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:09.860
And it's like Whoa,
this is like why can't they just come over?

1121
01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:14.030
What the fuck is that?
And you know,
why can't they just come over here?
You know,

1122
01:00:14.031 --> 01:00:17.690
can't we just like have like a screening process to see who's nice and if

1123
01:00:17.691 --> 01:00:18.800
they're nice,
let him over here.

1124
01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:22.190
Cause every definitely road would have been no borders.

1125
01:00:22.191 --> 01:00:24.500
Every place was the exact same.
It just seems,
I mean,

1126
01:00:24.501 --> 01:00:26.810
people will get crazy cousin,
bro.
That's chaos.

1127
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:29.150
There's a reason why there's borders.
The reason one is border patrol.

1128
01:00:29.151 --> 01:00:31.220
They're there to protect you.
You can't have no rules.

1129
01:00:31.221 --> 01:00:35.750
You fucking hit beats the old fucking he.
Yeah,
but if everybody was nice,

1130
01:00:35.751 --> 01:00:38.060
wouldn't it be possible to have no borders,
right?
Yeah.

1131
01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:41.480
What the fuck is keeping it?
You know,
that's,
that's the real issue at hand.

1132
01:00:41.481 --> 01:00:44.870
It's not more borders.
It's like how do you make everybody nice?
How do you,

1133
01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:48.310
how do you smooth it all out?
That's the real issue.
It's not borders.

1134
01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:51.440
There's gotta be a map that you can get before you make the trip.

1135
01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:55.330
Like a map of all the home depots and all the strawberry fields he's got to go

1136
01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:57.140
to.
Did you change,
move,
move forward?

1137
01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:00.050
So you're actually talking into the microphone.
That's why he had to turn it up.

1138
01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:03.380
There's got to be a map of what?
Pump up the volume.
Be Valuable.

1139
01:01:03.381 --> 01:01:07.190
A map with all the home depots and all the strawberry fields in southern

1140
01:01:07.191 --> 01:01:09.230
California,
right?
Like one of those maps,

1141
01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:12.740
the stars like cause you that you're going to get a job for sure.

1142
01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:14.540
You show up to a strawberry field,

1143
01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:16.550
they're going to give you like 20 bucks or something.

1144
01:01:16.551 --> 01:01:20.180
You're for sure going to get work done.
That's the bottom of the barrel.

1145
01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:23.840
How crazy are those maps,
those stars?
Those are so disgusting,
man.
When you,
you,

1146
01:01:23.841 --> 01:01:28.190
you see some dude sitting there with a,
uh,
like a pile of names.
Hey,

1147
01:01:28.191 --> 01:01:31.250
this is where this guy lives.
Go fuck with him.
This is where that guy lives.

1148
01:01:31.251 --> 01:01:34.490
Go stare at him while he's sleeping.
Have you ever done one of those?
No.
No.

1149
01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:39.410
That's so crazy.
So creepy.
It's like,
what are these guys thinking?

1150
01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:43.880
They're like,
you know,
handing out like free stalker guides.

1151
01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:46.190
Like this is the easy way to find where someone lives.

1152
01:01:46.191 --> 01:01:48.210
How easy is it to just make shit up?
Yeah.

1153
01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:53.220
Fucking a Neil diamond lives in that fucking house and a fucking Brad Pitt and

1154
01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:56.690
Angelina.
They're fucking crazy.
They're fucking right now.
The crazy.

1155
01:01:56.691 --> 01:02:00.560
They steal each other's blood.
Just wait for them.
They love their fans.

1156
01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:07.630
Like how would you go?
It's like how would you know they love their families.

1157
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:11.380
There are certain,
there are certain types of people that would,
you know,

1158
01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:15.230
they're catering to the same people that would buy that fake weed that you see

1159
01:02:15.231 --> 01:02:18.980
in like high times.
You met.
That was always the most disappointing shit ever.

1160
01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:22.620
High Times.
They would always,
you know,
be down for legalization is down.

1161
01:02:22.790 --> 01:02:25.800
Meanwhile you're selling fake weed.
You're ripping people off,
man.

1162
01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:29.910
Those are the sponsors.
Yeah,
but so what you,
your sponsors a crook.

1163
01:02:30.090 --> 01:02:33.330
You don't have a problem with your sponsor only praying on retards.

1164
01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:36.570
I mean that's what the sponsor did.
You,
if you bought that stuff,

1165
01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:40.320
you had to be like a 10 year old boy or retarded person to be something wrong

1166
01:02:40.321 --> 01:02:40.770
with you.

1167
01:02:40.770 --> 01:02:45.770
But Dude said that that's how high times survives is with our money because it's

1168
01:02:46.861 --> 01:02:48.090
like every other page.
There's like,

1169
01:02:48.091 --> 01:02:53.091
I refuse to admit or refuse to believe that in a nation of 300 million and who

1170
01:02:53.491 --> 01:02:56.610
knows how many pot smokers is there?
30 million of us,

1171
01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:58.860
let's say 30 million pot smokers in this country.

1172
01:02:58.890 --> 01:03:02.550
I refuse to believe that you couldn't produce a quality magazine.

1173
01:03:02.551 --> 01:03:05.850
That was interesting and then had to do with people who smoked pot,

1174
01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:10.230
who a engage in different activities and show how much marijuana enhances their

1175
01:03:10.231 --> 01:03:13.530
life instead of the same old stupid shit that they have in those magazines.

1176
01:03:13.531 --> 01:03:16.710
Every week,
every week there's a girl in a bikini and she's got a button or hand.

1177
01:03:16.711 --> 01:03:18.030
Whoa,
look at the bud.
It's crazy.

1178
01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:21.240
And look at the fucking look at the picture in the middle.
Amazing.

1179
01:03:21.241 --> 01:03:23.790
We have a picture of the bud.
You're not saying anything different.

1180
01:03:23.791 --> 01:03:27.550
It's all the same God Damn Shit and magazine industry so dead now.

1181
01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:30.440
That's the reason why they have to sell this fucking fake weed shit.

1182
01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:34.910
That fake weed shit is insulting you.
If that is like,
you know,

1183
01:03:35.250 --> 01:03:39.240
you're,
you're allowing someone to steal from your fans.

1184
01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:41.010
You're allowing someone that's like,

1185
01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:44.520
that's like if I had this thing and if the fleshlight and you know,

1186
01:03:44.530 --> 01:03:48.990
wasn't our sponsor and I decided to get some other be like big Dick Pills,

1187
01:03:49.290 --> 01:03:51.150
you know,
of big dig and man,
what a hypocrite.

1188
01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:55.080
What a creepy person I would be if I was allowing these people to get ripped off

1189
01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:58.170
by something.
You know,
allowing,
I was promoting something.

1190
01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:01.140
That's what they're doing,
man.
They've got pages of this shit,

1191
01:04:01.350 --> 01:04:06.150
these fake fucking buds.
And you ever tried that Dee Zee?
No,
I haven't tried.

1192
01:04:06.151 --> 01:04:09.450
I've heard it actually works the fuck out of here.
That shit doesn't work.

1193
01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:13.020
I actually know the stuff that k two stuff that they made illegal,

1194
01:04:13.021 --> 01:04:15.990
that stuff works.
But that shit they've been selling in high times.
Yo.

1195
01:04:15.991 --> 01:04:17.850
That's the shit they smoke in movies,
man.

1196
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:20.160
That's the shit that Mitch Hedberg smoked with.
Peter Frampton.

1197
01:04:20.161 --> 01:04:23.670
Remember that joke?
You remember that joke?
Mitch Hedberg Dude,
he goes,

1198
01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.870
how does it Mitch Hepberg doing it?
He goes,
um,

1199
01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:30.510
once smoked fake pot in a movie with Peter Frampton,
he goes,

1200
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:35.250
that's way better than smoking a real pot with a dude who looks like Peter.

1201
01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:37.530
I'd done that way more times.

1202
01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:43.410
I can match low.
He was awesome,
man.
He was amazing.

1203
01:04:43.770 --> 01:04:48.630
That's a guy that,
man,
when he died,
I went shit like that.
That really was like,

1204
01:04:48.631 --> 01:04:50.580
God damn it.
We lost a good one.
So you know,

1205
01:04:50.581 --> 01:04:53.610
it's so fucking weird about you saying that whole entire story.

1206
01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:58.890
The person that told me last that that shit worked and she was his ex.

1207
01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:02.640
Oh,
willin then.
Well maybe she was talking about that k two stuff.

1208
01:05:02.641 --> 01:05:05.580
That stuff's real legit.
How weird is that?
How weird is that?

1209
01:05:05.581 --> 01:05:08.370
This is recently a yet.
It was like a month ago.
Guarantee you.

1210
01:05:08.371 --> 01:05:12.060
She's talking about the,
the synthetic marijuana,
which does work,
that stuff.

1211
01:05:12.061 --> 01:05:14.340
They're making it illegal everywhere because it does work.

1212
01:05:14.370 --> 01:05:18.610
They've just modified it somehow or another so that it's not technically the

1213
01:05:18.611 --> 01:05:22.450
same thing as marijuana.
It just becomes the,
you know,
they can do that.

1214
01:05:22.451 --> 01:05:24.670
That's what they also did with those bath salts things.

1215
01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:27.400
Remember we thought it was bath salts,
but it really was,

1216
01:05:27.401 --> 01:05:29.450
is they were selling it as bad so they could sell it,

1217
01:05:29.770 --> 01:05:31.720
but it really was just amphetamines.
You know,

1218
01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:35.440
they can change the chemical components of something and make it something

1219
01:05:35.441 --> 01:05:38.680
that's not classified,
like,
you know,
like,
oh well here's this new thing.

1220
01:05:38.681 --> 01:05:41.470
What is this?
This isn't even illegal.
And so that's why they have,

1221
01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:43.210
they have also like some,

1222
01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:48.270
some laws in certain places where things become illegal if they're related or

1223
01:05:48.790 --> 01:05:50.470
you know,
to other things being illegal.

1224
01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:54.850
So that's why a five Meo DMT was never classified as a schedule one,

1225
01:05:54.851 --> 01:05:59.290
but it's the most potent form of DMT.
And you used to be able to buy it online.

1226
01:05:59.291 --> 01:06:01.780
Man used to be able to go to American chemical company,

1227
01:06:01.781 --> 01:06:05.940
all these different places and just by DMT online.
But then,
uh,

1228
01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:10.510
because it's up like related to nn Dmt,
which is illegal.

1229
01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:13.930
They made it illegal and they stopped people from selling it online and they

1230
01:06:13.931 --> 01:06:16.060
made them very aware that there were consequences,

1231
01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:18.700
even though it's not technically an illegal substance.

1232
01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:21.880
So what would happen if you got arrested in for it?
I don't know.
It's tricky.

1233
01:06:21.881 --> 01:06:25.990
You'd be able to fight it.
Probably.
See the real thing with all these schedules,

1234
01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:29.380
schedule one substances is the last thing they want is scrutiny.

1235
01:06:29.381 --> 01:06:30.730
They want anybody looking at them.

1236
01:06:30.731 --> 01:06:34.210
They don't want to make a new one illegal because then people start looking at

1237
01:06:34.211 --> 01:06:37.660
what,
what makes it illegal and what is legal?
And then the argument comes up,

1238
01:06:37.661 --> 01:06:41.620
well how can that be illegal when this is legal and that's illegal and this is

1239
01:06:41.621 --> 01:06:43.960
sold at every pharmaceutical company all across the country.

1240
01:06:43.961 --> 01:06:47.050
It's been shown to be incredibly addictive and this destroys your liver.

1241
01:06:47.051 --> 01:06:49.080
But doctors prescribed it like candy,
you know,

1242
01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:51.070
w it would open up the doors of scrutiny.

1243
01:06:51.071 --> 01:06:54.790
So what day would rather do is threatened people close all these companies down

1244
01:06:54.791 --> 01:06:57.760
there selling all this shit and not change any of the laws.
Just go,
Hey,

1245
01:06:57.761 --> 01:07:01.240
shut the fuck up.
Sit the fuck down.
This is the government here.

1246
01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:03.850
And that's what they do because they don't want everybody looking at it.

1247
01:07:03.851 --> 01:07:06.970
Because if you look at it at a certain point in time when you're a grown man,

1248
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.390
I am a 43 year old grown man.
Okay.

1249
01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:13.420
And if another grown man my age or God forbid,

1250
01:07:13.421 --> 01:07:17.920
even younger is telling me what I can and can't do with my body,

1251
01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:21.640
that doesn't hurt anybody and they don't even have research to back it up.

1252
01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:24.070
It's not like I saw that movie limitless the other day.

1253
01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:27.450
Pretty fucking interesting move.
Is that the one where he opens up his mind?
Yes.

1254
01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:31.510
He uses a,
it's a Bradley Cooper movie.
I didn't enjoy the end.

1255
01:07:31.870 --> 01:07:35.090
Spoiler alert.
It's Calgary or affects the MDR.
Pretty sweet.

1256
01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:40.000
Thought the end was wack.
[inaudible] was like,
oh,
he's awesome all the time now.

1257
01:07:40.030 --> 01:07:42.820
Sorry,
the end.
I win.
You lose.
There was so stupid.

1258
01:07:42.821 --> 01:07:45.770
We're that sucker punch you gotta hold on,
but hold on a second.
But um,
the,

1259
01:07:45.771 --> 01:07:48.400
the thing about that is that there were massive consequences.

1260
01:07:48.401 --> 01:07:51.730
Like he like he would like lose time.
Like it,
it became got,

1261
01:07:51.731 --> 01:07:55.570
people were dying from it.
It wasn't just as simple as you take this thing,

1262
01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:58.540
it accelerates you and then you just live like an awesome person for the rest of

1263
01:07:58.541 --> 01:08:02.020
your life.
There's,
there's consequences.
Now if you can't prove consequences,

1264
01:08:02.021 --> 01:08:05.230
then you have zero argument.
And that's the real argument.

1265
01:08:05.231 --> 01:08:07.750
The real problem with psychedelic drugs being illegal.

1266
01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:10.090
You have all these people saying that they've helped them.

1267
01:08:10.091 --> 01:08:13.300
All these people that are going and taking that,
I began like ed clay,

1268
01:08:13.301 --> 01:08:16.790
our friend Ed clay,
who changed his life,
changed who he is,
you know,

1269
01:08:16.791 --> 01:08:21.110
and became this really fucking warm,
open person after going on this,

1270
01:08:21.111 --> 01:08:25.430
these ibogaine retreats and that's illegal.
Why is it illegal?
There's no,

1271
01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:28.130
there's no sh there's no studies showing it harms you.

1272
01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:31.550
There's only studies showing that people have benefited from it and so many

1273
01:08:31.551 --> 01:08:36.551
people talk about it glowingly and yet you have other grown adults telling you

1274
01:08:36.650 --> 01:08:40.820
what you can and can't experience.
Then there's same ages you,
that's ridiculous.

1275
01:08:40.821 --> 01:08:44.940
That's nonsense.
There's,
there's a,
a lack of reality and a lack of,

1276
01:08:44.970 --> 01:08:47.540
of openness when it comes to discussing these things.

1277
01:08:47.541 --> 01:08:50.720
These things are never discussed and you know,
in,
in politics,

1278
01:08:50.750 --> 01:08:51.860
these are huge issues.

1279
01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:55.370
The issues of being able to control your consciousness is a giant issue and the

1280
01:08:55.371 --> 01:08:59.420
fact that that's not discussed ever during presidential campaigns shows how

1281
01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:03.710
infant tile we are,
at the very least.
Occasionally it gets breached.
Mr. Obama,

1282
01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:07.550
did you ever smoke marijuana?
And if so,
did you inhale you?
I'm sorry dude.

1283
01:09:07.730 --> 01:09:10.790
I thought that was the point hall.
That's it.
That's the,

1284
01:09:10.791 --> 01:09:13.910
the in depth version of the discussion on marijuana.

1285
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.500
Obama admits to smoking marijuana and inhaling says that was the point.

1286
01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:22.370
Amazing.
Oh,
and everybody,
it's like we're little children.

1287
01:09:22.371 --> 01:09:27.371
It's like as a nation and in our entirety we have the attitude about drugs,

1288
01:09:27.651 --> 01:09:30.800
about marijuana,
about psychedelics that an 11 year old has.

1289
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:34.040
That's how we treat it.
Like,
oh,
what are you doing with that?

1290
01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:37.550
What are you doing with that boy?
Yeah,
it's,
we're little.

1291
01:09:37.551 --> 01:09:38.690
We're a little fucking children.

1292
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:41.960
It's one of the biggest issues I think as far as consciousness goes,

1293
01:09:42.050 --> 01:09:44.990
that is in the world.
One of the number one issues,

1294
01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:46.790
the ability to control your consciousness,

1295
01:09:46.970 --> 01:09:50.660
the ability to seek personal evolution through psychedelic experience.
These,

1296
01:09:50.661 --> 01:09:54.590
these are huge issues.
These are issues that are radically transformed.
You,

1297
01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:57.950
radically transformed me,
radically transformed you.
You,
you,

1298
01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:00.480
we've all been transformed by psychedelic experience.

1299
01:10:00.481 --> 01:10:05.210
Guy Named Kelly Mullis who want to noble Nobel Peace Prize or uh,

1300
01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:09.370
I guess it is a Nobel peace prize for,
um,

1301
01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:14.390
work in DNA,
uh,
discover no science.
Nobel science.
Yeah.

1302
01:10:14.391 --> 01:10:18.500
He was the guy who founded on LSD,
right?
Yes,
yes,
exactly.

1303
01:10:18.501 --> 01:10:21.100
He did it while he was fucked up on it.
But yeah,
I don't remember what the,
uh,

1304
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:22.130
the,
the finding was,

1305
01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:26.210
but that guy actually is a bad example because idea turned crazy when he got

1306
01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:28.280
older.
Really?
Yeah.
Became like real belligerent,

1307
01:10:28.281 --> 01:10:30.560
getting crazy arguments with people and became a nutcase.

1308
01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:34.730
He has a lot of weird stuff about it.
Another interesting one is Francis Crick,

1309
01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:38.510
Francis Crick apparently,
and this is all hearsay because uh,
you know,

1310
01:10:38.511 --> 01:10:41.990
the article says very explicitly that Francis Crick told this man that if he

1311
01:10:41.991 --> 01:10:42.771
printed a word of this,

1312
01:10:42.771 --> 01:10:46.310
he would sue when they printed it obviously after quick died.
But Crick,

1313
01:10:46.311 --> 01:10:47.270
the guy who,
um,

1314
01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:52.010
he said that he came up with the idea of the double helix for DNA while he was

1315
01:10:52.011 --> 01:10:53.540
on acid.
But again,

1316
01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:57.920
this is a guy who says that Crick said that the problem is with anything like

1317
01:10:57.921 --> 01:11:00.560
that,
I said,
people are full of Shit.
Why would they lie?
I don't know.

1318
01:11:00.561 --> 01:11:03.050
But they could have and they do a lot.
You know,

1319
01:11:03.051 --> 01:11:04.790
people fucking lie like crazy man.

1320
01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:07.970
We were talking about that a game show in my head episode that I did,

1321
01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:12.080
I told you about this shit when we had people,
uh,
talk about Ufo shows on video.

1322
01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:14.160
We had a pretend news

1323
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:16.910
<v 1>camera and start talking about this is done.
This is what we did.</v>

1324
01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:18.630
The game show in my head was a fun ass show.

1325
01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:22.650
And what was interesting about it was there was a contestant and I had a

1326
01:11:22.651 --> 01:11:26.340
microphone and I would talk in their ear with a little earpiece and I would tell

1327
01:11:26.341 --> 01:11:28.170
them,
here's your stunt.
This is what you got to do.

1328
01:11:28.171 --> 01:11:30.180
They didn't know what was going to happen.
They didn't know where they were.

1329
01:11:30.210 --> 01:11:33.150
We had them in a van and then we would open the door and say,

1330
01:11:33.210 --> 01:11:36.630
walk to that mark on the floor and then Joe will be talking to you in your ear.

1331
01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:39.270
So they would walk to that mark.
I go,
all right dude,
you ready to do this?

1332
01:11:39.271 --> 01:11:42.720
He goes,
yeah,
here's what we got.
You are a news reporter.
Okay.

1333
01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:46.950
There was just a Ufo sighting right here in Hollywood.
It was huge.

1334
01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:49.890
A giant flying saucer was here and it took off.

1335
01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:52.350
Now you lost your witness.

1336
01:11:52.410 --> 01:11:55.950
The witness was going to go on camera and he was going to tell everybody about

1337
01:11:55.951 --> 01:11:59.160
this Ufo experience and now you're going to look really stupid because you've

1338
01:11:59.161 --> 01:12:00.750
got the camera here and there's no witness,

1339
01:12:00.990 --> 01:12:05.990
so you're going to try to ask one of these people to pretend it was them in you.

1340
01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:09.310
That was their stunt and every person that got to do it,
if they,

1341
01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:13.320
I think if they got three people to do it,
they won 5,000 bucks.
That's awesome,

1342
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:17.430
dude.
People did it instantly.
They did it instantly.
They started goes,
hey,

1343
01:12:17.790 --> 01:12:20.220
I wonder if you could do me a favor.
Those UFL here earlier,

1344
01:12:20.221 --> 01:12:22.110
apparently some people saw it and it was witnesses,

1345
01:12:22.111 --> 01:12:25.680
but I guess they chicken down with a camera's here.
Like,
I don't know what to do.

1346
01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:28.040
I mean,
do you think you could pretend that it was you?
Yeah,
man.
Yeah.

1347
01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:31.070
You can be on a TV right now.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Okay.
And you would,

1348
01:12:31.071 --> 01:12:33.390
people would just start talking.
What happened?
Oh Man.

1349
01:12:33.391 --> 01:12:35.430
It was a black bright light and in an an an an an.

1350
01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:39.480
Then a Ufo came and I just started talking.
It was incredible.

1351
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:41.370
We were all sitting in the truck,
what was happening?

1352
01:12:41.371 --> 01:12:44.190
We were shaking our heads going,
wow,
how full of shit or people,

1353
01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:48.150
people would just start talking about shit.
So that was my point.

1354
01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:51.960
I mean it's like,
I don't know if Francis Crick story about DNA was true.
Yeah.

1355
01:12:51.961 --> 01:12:56.130
It was a lot of fun man.
You were,
you were talking earlier about Ed clay.
Yeah.

1356
01:12:56.370 --> 01:12:57.570
The way it changed his life.

1357
01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:03.080
Ed Clay was a very successful entrepreneur who got their smart guy,

1358
01:13:05.010 --> 01:13:08.400
great guy who got very driven and you know,
he did Jujitsu.
He had a,

1359
01:13:08.410 --> 01:13:12.630
he has an MMA academy.
He was always hurt.
So like a lot of it and they athletes,

1360
01:13:12.930 --> 01:13:17.430
he got addicted to pills.
He got,
it was really bad.
It really was,

1361
01:13:17.490 --> 01:13:20.610
was a fucking up his life in a big way.

1362
01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:25.880
He heard about Ibogaine and Ibogaine is like the African version of DMT in a

1363
01:13:26.851 --> 01:13:27.684
nutshell.

1364
01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:33.500
And what I will gain does Iowasca apparently a curious alcoholism and Ibogaine

1365
01:13:36.990 --> 01:13:40.580
cures in,
in,
in a high percentage rate.
Uh,

1366
01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:44.910
I've a gang cures addiction,
a certain pills.
And Ed clay heard about it.

1367
01:13:44.911 --> 01:13:47.640
He went to,
it's illegal in the United States.
He went to Mexico.

1368
01:13:47.641 --> 01:13:49.350
There's this Ibogaine retreat in Mexico,

1369
01:13:49.351 --> 01:13:53.460
in this city that they're all trippers and they've all done Ibogaine and they've

1370
01:13:53.461 --> 01:13:54.870
done the Iowasca all of them.

1371
01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:58.650
And it's just like a city where there's music always said there was music 24

1372
01:13:58.651 --> 01:14:01.530
hours,
you land in Mexico City,
you drive four hours,

1373
01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:05.190
you're in this village and everyone's playing music.
There's artists everywhere.

1374
01:14:05.191 --> 01:14:07.110
There's music constantly was 24,
seven.

1375
01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:12.110
You hear people like singing and dancing and there's music and,
and uh,
he,

1376
01:14:12.170 --> 01:14:15.790
he went to this place,
he did the Ibogaine treatment,
which takes,

1377
01:14:16.010 --> 01:14:17.140
it takes you on a trip.

1378
01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:21.760
It's like Iowasca that lasts like two days or something like that last for a

1379
01:14:21.761 --> 01:14:25.180
long time.
And it's,
um,
it's,
you know,

1380
01:14:25.181 --> 01:14:27.730
you get to see yourself and you get to see the world for what it is.

1381
01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.110
And what it does is somehow it does something to your brain receptors or

1382
01:14:32.111 --> 01:14:35.080
something.
It's a realization of who you really are.

1383
01:14:35.290 --> 01:14:39.940
And it resets your receptors in some weird way.
I don't know the details,

1384
01:14:39.941 --> 01:14:43.180
but it changed his life.
He came back to the states.
So it said as receptors.

1385
01:14:43.181 --> 01:14:47.380
As far as addictions,
yes,
yes.
And it's not just a psychological healing.

1386
01:14:47.381 --> 01:14:51.250
It's actually a physical healing and actually,
exactly.
Wow.
That's incredible.

1387
01:14:51.251 --> 01:14:54.760
He changes.
I mean he is.
How many people is I work on?
Do you know?
He's dedicated.

1388
01:14:54.761 --> 01:14:55.331
It's a high percent.

1389
01:14:55.331 --> 01:15:00.331
It's like 80% he dedicated his life to I will gain and all the money that he's

1390
01:15:00.911 --> 01:15:04.450
had from other businesses.
He sold one of his businesses,
a big MMA company.

1391
01:15:04.690 --> 01:15:09.690
He sold it and he's dedicated his whole life to saving as many people from

1392
01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:12.580
addiction of pills as possible.

1393
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:17.800
Amazing that we have this issue in this country where that thing which is so

1394
01:15:17.801 --> 01:15:22.540
helpful is illegal and these things that are so damaging and so scary,

1395
01:15:22.690 --> 01:15:23.380
our legal,

1396
01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:26.440
and they lied about how addictive they are and when they got them through,

1397
01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:29.440
when they made fucking Oxycontin's legal,
there's a,

1398
01:15:29.441 --> 01:15:32.260
there's a bunch of documents that show that they weren't being honest about the

1399
01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:35.550
possibility of addiction.
That stuffs heroin,
man,

1400
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:37.300
that stuff gets so many of my friend,

1401
01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:40.630
I don't want to say his name because I don't want to be public about it,

1402
01:15:40.631 --> 01:15:44.810
but someone,
someone I know very recently died of it.
He had a pill problem.
Hello.

1403
01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:49.540
You know,
and it's,
it's scary shit man.
You know,
I've,
I've known people that,

1404
01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:53.380
uh,
immediately became a pill.
Zombies I've known,

1405
01:15:53.770 --> 01:15:57.250
I've known to people very well and it became pills on bees while I knew them.

1406
01:15:57.730 --> 01:16:00.610
And um,
some scary shit,
man.
Scary that the government doesn't stop.

1407
01:16:00.611 --> 01:16:03.190
That if you're out there and you have a pill problem or you know,

1408
01:16:03.191 --> 01:16:07.810
somebody that has a pill problem look into Ibogaine Ibo,
g a.

1409
01:16:07.811 --> 01:16:12.390
I.
N.
E I think I will gain ed clay.
If you look him up.
He's,
he'll,

1410
01:16:12.490 --> 01:16:15.880
he's doing everything he can to help as many people as possible.
I mean,
you know,

1411
01:16:15.881 --> 01:16:19.810
it's really funny that I will gain was the drug that got hunter s Thompson and

1412
01:16:19.930 --> 01:16:22.120
uh,
in trouble when he was a journalist,

1413
01:16:22.121 --> 01:16:26.650
when he was covering the hunters Thompson was to fucking genius writer and such

1414
01:16:26.651 --> 01:16:30.370
an interesting guy.
And what he did was he was covering the elections.

1415
01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:32.860
I'm like 1970 something,
whatever the fuck it was.

1416
01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:35.110
And he just decided to start making shit up.

1417
01:16:35.470 --> 01:16:37.780
So he started making shit up about these candidates.

1418
01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:41.140
And one of the things that he said was that Ed ed muskie brought in a Brazilian

1419
01:16:41.141 --> 01:16:45.330
doctor and because he's addicted to Ibogaine and he shows like all the,
uh,

1420
01:16:45.331 --> 01:16:47.620
the symptoms of Ibogaine addiction and he put the shit in,

1421
01:16:47.630 --> 01:16:50.920
this is printed in the rolling stone.
So everybody thought this was real.

1422
01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:52.960
Everybody thought to.
So they started asking him about,

1423
01:16:52.961 --> 01:16:57.100
and I slowly started breaking down.
The guy started going crazy publicly,

1424
01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:00.010
like the pressure got to him and he would give these public speeches and

1425
01:17:00.011 --> 01:17:02.380
everybody would be accusing him of being on some crazy drug.

1426
01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:03.880
And so hunter is Tom Chan,

1427
01:17:04.030 --> 01:17:08.680
like literally drove this guy insane by writing that he was on drugs.
The guy,

1428
01:17:08.710 --> 01:17:10.130
there's video of the guy again,
the movie

1429
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:11.270
<v 3>Gonzo,
you see the V,</v>

1430
01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:14.000
there's video of the guy like breaking down at a campaign speech.

1431
01:17:14.210 --> 01:17:15.770
Just lose his mind.
It was Ibogaine.

1432
01:17:16.010 --> 01:17:17.830
That's what a Thompson had said that he was addicted to.

1433
01:17:17.850 --> 01:17:21.680
And then another guy was addicted to see made up a name of speed called wallet,

1434
01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:24.020
some exotic brand of speed.

1435
01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:28.520
Then you're fucking running for president back in the 70s.
And that shit happens.

1436
01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:31.730
You know,
you get this crazy ass asshole just making shit up about you.

1437
01:17:31.731 --> 01:17:34.400
And there was no internet,
there was no nothing.
You couldn't,

1438
01:17:34.401 --> 01:17:37.850
you couldn't go on TV and talk about it.
And it was really funny,
man.

1439
01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:41.240
It's fucking interesting shit.
He goes,
well I didn't lie.
He goes,
uh,
there was uh,

1440
01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:43.520
there was a rumor going around Milwaukee that uh,

1441
01:17:43.521 --> 01:17:46.880
he was addicted to Ibogaine and I,
I was one who started the rumor.

1442
01:17:49.370 --> 01:17:51.380
<v 0>It's like,
all I said was there was a rumor.
He goes,</v>

1443
01:17:51.381 --> 01:17:55.150
I was actually pretty factual or described it.
It's very funny,
man.

1444
01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:58.070
Did you see a sucker punch at all?
Not yet heard.
It's awesome though.

1445
01:17:58.550 --> 01:18:01.430
It looks pretty bad ass.
Like,
you know what?
You see it.
Did you see it?
No,

1446
01:18:01.431 --> 01:18:05.750
I haven't seen it,
but I only saw,
I guess the,
the teaser preview in the past.

1447
01:18:05.751 --> 01:18:09.380
I just don't like the real preview.
Holy Shit.
I never saw the whole preview.

1448
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:13.520
You go to see that movie and you're not stoned.
You should go to jail.

1449
01:18:13.521 --> 01:18:16.670
Why is it movie night in Three d though?
It's that.
That's why I'm pissed.

1450
01:18:16.730 --> 01:18:20.180
It's not,
I don't think it's in three really?
Yeah,
it's an Imax,

1451
01:18:20.181 --> 01:18:21.014
but it's not an imax.

1452
01:18:21.370 --> 01:18:22.930
<v 3>You know what,
man?
I gotta be honest.</v>

1453
01:18:23.410 --> 01:18:26.320
The movie has to be super special for me to be into it in Three D.

1454
01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:28.390
I'm annoyed wearing those stupid glasses.

1455
01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:31.830
<v 0>Those things don't bother me.
Really.
I liked the visuals.
I like the glass.</v>

1456
01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:35.880
Google glass is bugged the shit out of me.
I don't know.
But you know,

1457
01:18:35.881 --> 01:18:38.310
I guess I shouldn't say that because then it doesn't beg me in every movie cause

1458
01:18:38.311 --> 01:18:40.980
an Avatar.
It was so spectacular that it didn't bug me.

1459
01:18:41.130 --> 01:18:43.680
I saw that on la and that was the biggest thing.
How has that

1460
01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:50.100
looked like?
It looked,
it looked like to me it was,
you know,
from the,
the,

1461
01:18:50.101 --> 01:18:52.770
the point of view of a bunch of marines fighting,

1462
01:18:52.771 --> 01:18:56.970
getting called to fight these aliens that landed on in La and they're fighting

1463
01:18:56.971 --> 01:19:01.660
them through La.
It looks like a video game.
Like infomercial kind of,

1464
01:19:02.340 --> 01:19:06.960
it looked like a trick.
It's like the plot was so gears of war four so bad.

1465
01:19:06.970 --> 01:19:10.240
The gears of war would have a way better plot.
Oh Man.
The way they got there,

1466
01:19:10.290 --> 01:19:14.670
the way they,
they won and they beat the aliens.
Don't even tell me

1467
01:19:16.380 --> 01:19:18.060
so bad.
It's just what we were talking about earlier,

1468
01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:21.230
<v 3>the MMA movie,
this fast and furious.
The same thing.
There's a bunch of people,</v>

1469
01:19:21.231 --> 01:19:23.750
Megan,
dumb ass movies.
But here's the reason why man,

1470
01:19:23.751 --> 01:19:26.120
this is what you don't realize.
Where I don't realize sometimes either.

1471
01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:29.960
I like to go on [inaudible] dot TV or mixed martial arts.com I love to go on

1472
01:19:29.961 --> 01:19:30.541
there cause it's,

1473
01:19:30.541 --> 01:19:33.770
it's a fun place to talk about Jujitsu and fighting and you know,

1474
01:19:33.771 --> 01:19:35.570
and talk about MMA and UFC shit.

1475
01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:38.840
But it's also fun to see how fucking dumb some of those people are.

1476
01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:42.340
One guy put a big post about movies or putting about mood.

1477
01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:45.200
Like when the expendables came out there were,
they were going off,

1478
01:19:45.230 --> 01:19:47.960
dudes were going off talking about how great the expendables was,

1479
01:19:48.050 --> 01:19:51.710
mixed martial arts.com they were going off about how great the expendables where

1480
01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:55.010
I thought this has to be ironic.
Like this has to be irony.

1481
01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:56.420
Like they couldn't have actually enjoyed this.

1482
01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:59.570
It was one look I like a good fucking blow them up moving more than anybody.

1483
01:19:59.571 --> 01:20:02.840
But that was one of the worst movies of all time and it was unbelievably bad.

1484
01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:06.110
And as I'm watching them,
when I call in a holy fuck is this bad?

1485
01:20:06.380 --> 01:20:08.220
But then I go online and you read people talking

1486
01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:11.010
<v 1>about it and they're like,
just fucking emerge movie.</v>

1487
01:20:11.070 --> 01:20:14.820
I'm going to sit again this weekend when my cousin and I'm like,
are they 15 or

1488
01:20:15.090 --> 01:20:18.210
<v 5>yes.
Is that what it is?
You got to remember about age groups.</v>

1489
01:20:18.211 --> 01:20:19.710
So like I keep on forgetting about this,

1490
01:20:19.711 --> 01:20:23.490
but half these people on Twitter that are to have the bad language skills and

1491
01:20:23.491 --> 01:20:25.380
stuff like that.
They're probably 12.
Yeah.

1492
01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:29.790
Cause if I was 12 I'd be talking shit nonstop all day long.
Very likely.

1493
01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:34.740
But anyway,
what was my point
about the guy that on the message board,

1494
01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:35.673
uh,

1495
01:20:35.690 --> 01:20:37.520
<v 1>battle La.
Exactly.</v>

1496
01:20:37.550 --> 01:20:40.070
And they were talking just about battle La the other day about how fucking

1497
01:20:40.071 --> 01:20:43.100
awesome it was.
Five stars,
amazing movie.

1498
01:20:43.310 --> 01:20:46.010
And then it was like four or five dudes would say that.
And I'd be like,

1499
01:20:46.130 --> 01:20:48.780
I'd be like squeezing my head together and go really real.

1500
01:20:48.830 --> 01:20:51.650
And then one guy would come on and go,
you guys are all retarded.

1501
01:20:51.651 --> 01:20:53.980
That movie sucked a million Cox,
you listen to it.
Yeah.

1502
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:54.980
And I'll go back to the tech guys.

1503
01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:58.370
But that's also probably the guy that talks about shit about your music and

1504
01:20:58.371 --> 01:21:00.940
about my comedy.
You know,
the guys who were negative man,
they're,

1505
01:21:00.941 --> 01:21:04.370
they're not always right.
The negative all the time.
But when it comes to movies,

1506
01:21:04.371 --> 01:21:08.000
man,
it's very difficult to find like a good group that you agree with.

1507
01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:09.650
Everything,
dumbest aliens ever.

1508
01:21:09.651 --> 01:21:11.540
Once they got on the ground and they had like these,

1509
01:21:11.630 --> 01:21:16.580
these tall ass robot aliens like terminator don't wear like dom like you got you

1510
01:21:16.581 --> 01:21:21.470
will across the fucking galaxy and these guys are hiding behind a bus 20 yards

1511
01:21:21.471 --> 01:21:24.560
away from you and there's a scene that last five minutes and they're behind the

1512
01:21:24.561 --> 01:21:26.480
bus and all around in these aliens are fucking,

1513
01:21:26.481 --> 01:21:30.860
everybody up at your soldiers had like this little girl and the fucking cat and

1514
01:21:30.861 --> 01:21:31.820
they're like,
I'm like,

1515
01:21:32.090 --> 01:21:35.060
how long has this scene to aliens are still trying to walk?

1516
01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:36.350
They were totally retarded.

1517
01:21:36.370 --> 01:21:39.190
<v 5>You know,
it looks really bad.
Is that knew Arthur remake.
Oh,</v>

1518
01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:42.700
seen that preview of that.
It's just like the exact one.

1519
01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:46.210
Why would you remake that into,
it's just like they're just adding like,
oh,

1520
01:21:46.211 --> 01:21:47.560
an Xbox live

1521
01:21:48.010 --> 01:21:51.420
<v 1>dude.
He's funny though.
I like Kim Man.
I liked him.
I like that.</v>

1522
01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:54.100
Did you like get them to the Greek?
I did like that movie,
Dude.

1523
01:21:54.101 --> 01:21:54.970
He's going to like that movie.

1524
01:21:54.971 --> 01:21:58.660
There's a movie called the man from her character is one of the dumbest movies

1525
01:21:58.661 --> 01:22:00.500
that people have been recommended to me lately.
Oh,

1526
01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:03.790
there's a movie called the man from Earth about a guy who was a fucking cave man

1527
01:22:03.810 --> 01:22:07.450
who survived until today and he was Jesus.

1528
01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:11.440
And it's like a play.
Like they're over this guy's house.
He's leaving.

1529
01:22:11.441 --> 01:22:14.590
He has to leave cause he doesn't age and he doesn't want them all to get

1530
01:22:14.591 --> 01:22:19.120
suspicious.
So every 10 years he has to up and leave.
It is so bad.

1531
01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:23.500
It's so stupid and the acting is so dumb,
but yet all these fucking people,

1532
01:22:23.501 --> 01:22:27.310
what do you got to watch this?
It's amazing.
So fascinating.

1533
01:22:27.311 --> 01:22:30.160
So intriguing.
You know,
and like Mike,

1534
01:22:30.161 --> 01:22:34.360
how could you be intrigued by this dumb ass movie about a caveman who was Jesus

1535
01:22:34.430 --> 01:22:37.870
who is still alive today?
Really,
really?
Oh,

1536
01:22:37.871 --> 01:22:40.600
that's why he came back from the dead because he's like super,
he can't die.

1537
01:22:40.660 --> 01:22:44.440
He's like SUPERNAP.
Battleaxe had me for like 35 minutes to beginning.

1538
01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:48.400
The beginning of battle was good.
I was like,
fuck man.
That okay.

1539
01:22:48.401 --> 01:22:51.040
They're doing a good job.
20 minutes into it.
I'm like,
okay,

1540
01:22:51.070 --> 01:22:54.080
would that mean show the aliens?
Yet the ones they started fighting what?

1541
01:22:54.081 --> 01:22:56.980
The aliens,
they couldn't figure that one.
I like to make it realistic.

1542
01:22:57.160 --> 01:22:58.900
You really think that'd be a battle.
There's like these,

1543
01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:02.470
these marines that survived and they're finally pulling them out of the city,

1544
01:23:02.471 --> 01:23:06.190
La because they're going to nuke it.
They're going to new it.
We got out in time.

1545
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:10.180
<v 3>They're going to do new kit that goes off.
One do drops off.
He Goes,</v>

1546
01:23:10.181 --> 01:23:14.290
I'm Colin's back when you go back and then another and then Michelle Rodriguez

1547
01:23:14.291 --> 01:23:16.570
comes down.
She,
because I'm going to go with you.
She wants him dead.

1548
01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:18.120
They're dropping them off the bat.

1549
01:23:18.130 --> 01:23:21.470
Some common kamikaze leg and they went four of them.
Four.

1550
01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:25.170
<v 5>You know what sucks though?</v>

1551
01:23:25.230 --> 01:23:30.230
Is that battle La on rotten tomatoes got like a 34% rotten tomatoes is a Saudi

1552
01:23:31.291 --> 01:23:33.830
accurate sucker punch 21

1553
01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:37.280
<v 3>oh,
okay.
Fuck you.
I'm not going then I'll trust them.</v>

1554
01:23:38.090 --> 01:23:40.190
That's the beautiful thing about the Internet man.
Back in the,

1555
01:23:40.191 --> 01:23:43.700
you still have to listen to Roger Ebert.
Roger Heber didn't like gladiator.

1556
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.180
He didn't like the unforgettable,

1557
01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:47.780
it's like a bunch of movies that he didn't like that were fucking awesome.

1558
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:50.900
Gladiator,
Huh?
Fuck do not like gladiator.
Yeah.

1559
01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:54.200
I would like to seek his top 10 dislikes that,
you know,

1560
01:23:54.260 --> 01:23:57.130
that ended up getting Oscars or something.
Yeah.

1561
01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:02.000
He got in a little hissy fit with a fucking Charlie Sheen online on Twitter.

1562
01:24:02.110 --> 01:24:03.860
It was interesting recently.
Yeah,

1563
01:24:03.861 --> 01:24:07.280
we were talking about it and one of the post fight video blog or the post

1564
01:24:07.281 --> 01:24:11.330
podcast video blogs,
it was like tr,
he wrote something about Charlie Sheen,

1565
01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:15.610
I could do what he's doing,
but then my wife would leave me and then,
uh,
Charlie,

1566
01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:18.580
you know,
and then I would be lonely and depressed just like him.
And He,

1567
01:24:18.581 --> 01:24:20.980
and he and Charlie writes back to Roger,

1568
01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:23.270
didn't even have five girls at the same time,
you know,

1569
01:24:23.271 --> 01:24:27.950
like along the lines of dining loan was stupid,
you know,
and I'm like,

1570
01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:31.570
I can't believe Roger Ebert is going after Charlie Sheen.
Like Roger Paper,

1571
01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:35.330
it's like almost dead.
He lost his jaw to cancer.
He can't talk,
he can't eat.

1572
01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:38.270
He has to eat through a tube and yet he's shitting on Charlie Sheen,

1573
01:24:38.271 --> 01:24:39.620
forgetting hookers and

1574
01:24:40.090 --> 01:24:43.560
<v 5>whores.
Really Valley of the dolls.
What does that he's,</v>

1575
01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:48.580
that's a movie they wrote that movie he wrote and it's all about dogs or like

1576
01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:51.850
corn chips,
isn't it?
Is it?
Who wrote it?
Roger Ebert.

1577
01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:54.700
Maybe he lives this whole different life.
We don't know.

1578
01:24:54.701 --> 01:24:58.720
And he's just some crazy old per he said.
He said it sucked.

1579
01:24:58.950 --> 01:25:02.890
I saw it that the due date movie.
Have you seen that yet?
I just came on TV.

1580
01:25:02.891 --> 01:25:04.960
I like Brody Stevens at the beginning of it.
Yeah.

1581
01:25:05.090 --> 01:25:08.820
<v 3>Yup,
Yup.
That golf [inaudible] in anything.</v>

1582
01:25:09.890 --> 01:25:14.160
That guy now I know.
He's so talented.
They don't even make him shaved.
The beard.

1583
01:25:14.180 --> 01:25:17.160
Yeah.
Every movie.
Ah,
no.
That's his look man.
I know they won't.

1584
01:25:17.161 --> 01:25:20.990
They don't helps and it helps though.
So good.
He's so good.
If he was a wreck,

1585
01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:24.480
we're going to need you to shave it for this character.
Well,

1586
01:25:24.481 --> 01:25:26.760
he made what makes him look like he's that strange guy

1587
01:25:27.770 --> 01:25:31.570
<v 5>you hear about Brody Stevens also HBO has picked them up for a new TV show.</v>

1588
01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:32.410
What is it?
Uh,

1589
01:25:32.410 --> 01:25:35.590
Zach Alpha and Hopkins is going to pretty much make a show about Brody,

1590
01:25:35.650 --> 01:25:39.510
like a documentary type thing.
Machiavellian.
That's amazing.
Yeah.

1591
01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:42.730
That's Brody Stevens blowing the fuck up.
Good for him.
Well,

1592
01:25:42.731 --> 01:25:46.060
Brody has always just needed someone to sort of like direct people to what he

1593
01:25:46.061 --> 01:25:46.960
does.
You know,

1594
01:25:47.370 --> 01:25:50.220
<v 3>he's amazing.
You know,
he's a,
he's one of the funniest guys I know.</v>

1595
01:25:50.221 --> 01:25:54.270
He's so interesting,
man.
He's such a fucking unusual dude.

1596
01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:56.670
He could talk about anything.

1597
01:25:58.280 --> 01:26:02.960
<v 5>Okay.
And for whatever reason he's fascinating.
You know,
welfare.
I'll just,</v>

1598
01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:05.140
the role of the office too.
I'm going to use that.
Let's,

1599
01:26:05.190 --> 01:26:08.530
I think that's only for like three episodes.
Oh,
is it?
Yeah,
I'm pretty sure.
Oh,

1600
01:26:08.750 --> 01:26:11.540
that guy's too fucking busy,
bro.
That's gonna say that.
That's awesome.

1601
01:26:11.541 --> 01:26:12.374
If he's doing that.

1602
01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:16.100
<v 0>Yeah.
Gay.
I mean stupid.</v>

1603
01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:23.060
Why'd you bring that up?
Welfare on the office

1604
01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:27.230
<v 5>because I,
that's pretty crazy that,
uh,
um,
that's big.
That's huge.</v>

1605
01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:30.500
<v 3>It was.
It Will Ferrell.
I don't watch those sitcoms.
I fucking love welfare.</v>

1606
01:26:30.501 --> 01:26:33.770
Oh Man.
I've never watched sitcoms.
Let me get around the office.

1607
01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:36.590
I get around to a south park every now and then if I'm going to watch something

1608
01:26:36.591 --> 01:26:37.880
that's funny,
but I don't

1609
01:26:37.970 --> 01:26:39.620
<v 5>spend too much time watching Oprah.
I need it.</v>

1610
01:26:39.950 --> 01:26:43.010
<v 3>No,
don't do that.
It helps me Brown.
It helps me.</v>

1611
01:26:43.300 --> 01:26:44.570
It helps me understand those people.

1612
01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:47.600
I was wireless and I'd come from conservative talk radio to,

1613
01:26:48.050 --> 01:26:50.930
I mean I listen to conservative talk radio because I don't know anybody like

1614
01:26:50.931 --> 01:26:53.630
that.
I want to know how this fucking people think and when I have those,

1615
01:26:53.631 --> 01:26:56.540
you know what the libs don't know.
Okay.
I'll tell you right now.

1616
01:26:56.600 --> 01:27:00.590
Here's what the libs don't know.
Oh,
Barma doesn't like you either.
Okay.

1617
01:27:00.591 --> 01:27:04.820
Obama is one of those elite estimate and I like listening to that shit because

1618
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:07.970
this,
this fucking guy believes this.
He selling this.

1619
01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:09.860
I was listening to Glenn Black back this morning.

1620
01:27:09.861 --> 01:27:13.310
I stopped in my driveway for five minutes just sitting there shaking my head,

1621
01:27:13.311 --> 01:27:16.820
listening to Glenn Beck this morning just like this is crazy ass hole and thinks

1622
01:27:16.821 --> 01:27:19.940
that the reason why the fucking tsunami and earthquake happened is because we're

1623
01:27:19.941 --> 01:27:23.600
not following the 10 commandments.
That crazy.
Ansul Ashley suggested that,

1624
01:27:24.050 --> 01:27:27.080
you know,
so I,
I look,
I listened to everybody.
So Oprah's on the list too,
man.

1625
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:29.090
I gotta I gotta listen,
I gotta find out what she's up to.

1626
01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:31.693
<v 0>Hmm.</v>

1627
01:27:32.630 --> 01:27:37.520
<v 5>Fucking yeah,
you got to fight.
No,
I,
I,
I just don't even,
that's like,</v>

1628
01:27:37.521 --> 01:27:41.630
it seems like a bunch of serious stuff to watch,
I guess.
I don't know.
I mean,

1629
01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:43.430
I like,
if I'm going to watch anything serious,

1630
01:27:43.431 --> 01:27:46.590
it's going to be like fucking cops are murder stuff so I can,
you know,

1631
01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:49.700
at least learn a skill trade if I'm going to murder somebody,

1632
01:27:49.701 --> 01:27:50.534
how I can get away with it.

1633
01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:54.190
<v 3>Interventions.
Do you ever feeling down about yourself intervention?</v>

1634
01:27:54.410 --> 01:27:57.820
Never want to like know that you're going to be okay.
Watch intervention,

1635
01:27:58.140 --> 01:27:59.940
every rehab,
no intervention,

1636
01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:03.700
all of those things where people are falling apart and then people have to go

1637
01:28:03.701 --> 01:28:07.030
and rescue them.
People that are doing crack and heroin and love that crazy now.

1638
01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:09.400
So that's part of celebrity rehab.
That's my favorite show.

1639
01:28:09.430 --> 01:28:14.110
My favorite part of celebrity rehab is a fucking,
um,
what's his name?

1640
01:28:14.230 --> 01:28:18.100
Eric Roberts.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That guy was on.

1641
01:28:18.170 --> 01:28:21.850
It just needs a friend Rehab for weed.
Yeah,
it was hilarious.

1642
01:28:21.851 --> 01:28:24.670
He never had a problem.
People were falling apart all around them.

1643
01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:27.700
He's in the back reading it like on the side reading a newspaper.

1644
01:28:27.701 --> 01:28:31.570
What does glas is eating a sandwich?
He never had a story.

1645
01:28:31.630 --> 01:28:33.100
I mean he did have like a rough childhood.

1646
01:28:33.101 --> 01:28:35.980
I mean the problem with that shows he cried once.
He cried once,

1647
01:28:36.250 --> 01:28:40.450
but like a doctor Jude talks so much shit on weed that when he,

1648
01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:43.530
when Eric Roberts came to him,
he's a celebrity.
He needs a celebrity man.

1649
01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:45.880
Not very many celebrities will go on that show.
They go,

1650
01:28:45.881 --> 01:28:48.220
we got Eric Roberts cause what's to here for,
for weed?

1651
01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:49.180
What are you going to tell him?

1652
01:28:49.390 --> 01:28:52.570
I mean he tells every doctor who tells everybody that weed's bad for you.

1653
01:28:52.630 --> 01:28:55.570
So he's gotta admit him when really he has no problem.

1654
01:28:55.630 --> 01:28:57.760
That was the craziest part.
He has his problems.

1655
01:28:57.761 --> 01:29:00.370
He does nothing to do with the weeding.
Yeah.
It didn't eat well.

1656
01:29:00.371 --> 01:29:04.370
He was using weed as an escape from his life and it just happened to be weed.

1657
01:29:04.371 --> 01:29:07.840
It could have been cough syrup.
No.
He could have found some other shit.
This case.

1658
01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:11.520
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah,
I guess.
But I think it was just,</v>

1659
01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:16.260
I think it was a way to blow up Eric Roberts and he doesn't look bad.

1660
01:29:16.290 --> 01:29:19.320
I don't know what an easy way to,
to rejuvenate the career.

1661
01:29:19.321 --> 01:29:23.860
Celebrity Rehab is fucking cute.
You know what,
he didn't,
he,
well,

1662
01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:26.790
he didn't look bad at all.
The very,
the very first day when the analyze them,

1663
01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:30.420
he said,
doc,
I,
I smoke from a vaporizer.
They show me it's healthier.

1664
01:29:30.421 --> 01:29:31.320
He's talking about a big prize.

1665
01:29:31.321 --> 01:29:35.820
I was healthier and he didn't smoke that much at all.
And he said,
when I smoke,

1666
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.230
everybody loves me.
I am in a great mood,
you know,
um,
I flow.

1667
01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:44.160
But when I don't smoke,
I get,
you know,
in a cranky mood and I,
and I'm pissed off.

1668
01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:46.380
That's what he said the problem is.
And doctors with us,
hmm,

1669
01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:47.550
we've got to work on that.

1670
01:29:50.230 --> 01:29:52.470
He showed him that he's smoking out of the vaporizer.

1671
01:29:52.471 --> 01:29:56.490
So I think that Eric Roberts and go,
this is a perfect way.
Well for

1672
01:29:56.490 --> 01:30:00.330
<v 3>doctor drew,
man,
there's no solution other than sobriety.
You know,
I've,
I,</v>

1673
01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:03.600
I retweeted something.
I,
I'd say,
I think,

1674
01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:07.170
I forget what someone tweeted something about pot and I retweeted it going suck

1675
01:30:07.171 --> 01:30:08.730
on that doctor drew,
you know,

1676
01:30:08.731 --> 01:30:12.060
like to him thinking that I've been friends with that guy for years.

1677
01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:14.100
When are we going to get him on?
We've gotten lot of love to,
yes,

1678
01:30:14.101 --> 01:30:16.740
he got mad at me.
Whoa.
I've been friends with him for years and he's like,

1679
01:30:16.741 --> 01:30:20.110
Hey Joe,
I'm sorry I'm killing your,
hi.
What the hell man?
Whoa.
Yeah,

1680
01:30:20.410 --> 01:30:23.130
Whoa are attacking me or something like that.
And I go,
well dude,

1681
01:30:23.131 --> 01:30:25.680
I'm just as just a joke.
I thought you knew my son's a who are,
you know,

1682
01:30:25.681 --> 01:30:28.540
I love you.
And he writes back,
I love you too.
So it was cool.
I mean,

1683
01:30:28.541 --> 01:30:29.430
it all wind up Cuba.

1684
01:30:29.430 --> 01:30:33.270
He thought that I was like really like fuck you doctor drew socket back.

1685
01:30:33.271 --> 01:30:35.820
Some guys you can't joke around like that.
You can't,
like,

1686
01:30:35.821 --> 01:30:39.830
you could text me something and say suck on that bitch.
And I would be like,
yeah,

1687
01:30:39.831 --> 01:30:42.450
I would laugh.
Have,
you could do it too,
but with Dr Drew,

1688
01:30:42.451 --> 01:30:45.430
apparently you can't text Dr drew and say suck on it bitch.

1689
01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.460
She texted him or emailed him.
Twitter does.

1690
01:30:47.470 --> 01:30:50.290
Do you think you'll ever digital shit onto the I twittered it so that everyone

1691
01:30:50.291 --> 01:30:53.850
saw.
Yeah,
but come on man.
It's funny.
Hey,
so,
so,
um,

1692
01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:56.340
the fuck do you think you would ever do,
did that did the show?
No,

1693
01:30:56.341 --> 01:30:57.620
but I'm going to do Loveline I'm going to do,

1694
01:30:57.930 --> 01:31:00.090
maybe he was kidding about doing it.
Maybe he was kidding.

1695
01:31:00.091 --> 01:31:03.210
Mike is on dancing with the stars right now.
What exactly did he say again?

1696
01:31:03.210 --> 01:31:05.610
Maybe he don't know.
He wasn't kidding.
You got it.
You got a little upset.

1697
01:31:05.611 --> 01:31:08.010
He thought it was actually upset when I was staying stuck on that.
He was like,

1698
01:31:08.011 --> 01:31:09.690
I'm sorry I'm killing your high with the helmet man.
Get it.

1699
01:31:09.691 --> 01:31:12.210
Seemed like he was hurting.
His feelings were hurt.
Like I attacked him.
Okay.

1700
01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:16.290
This is the only discussion that we,
he and I have ever disagreed on.
I,

1701
01:31:16.630 --> 01:31:20.670
I think that he's absolutely right about how much abuse goes on and you know,

1702
01:31:20.671 --> 01:31:21.900
like when,
when he can nail it,

1703
01:31:21.901 --> 01:31:24.150
when he's talking to people about like what's wrong with them?

1704
01:31:24.350 --> 01:31:29.350
What I think is he discounts that there are very healthy people that can benefit

1705
01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:33.210
from marijuana and that's,
that's the difference.
I'm,
you know,

1706
01:31:33.211 --> 01:31:36.210
people that aren't sick that don't have addiction problems,

1707
01:31:36.211 --> 01:31:39.420
that don't have substance problems,
they can benefit greatly from marijuana.

1708
01:31:39.421 --> 01:31:42.300
And the problem is he's dealing with a completely tainted pool.

1709
01:31:42.450 --> 01:31:44.670
Everyone that he's dealing with,
it's fucked up.

1710
01:31:44.850 --> 01:31:47.700
He's his very few people that he's dealing with that aren't,

1711
01:31:47.790 --> 01:31:50.880
he's an addiction specialist.
He's,
he's,
by the time they get to him,

1712
01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:53.370
they're life is in the God damn toilet.
They're fucking falling apart.

1713
01:31:53.490 --> 01:31:56.460
He's not necessarily sitting down with people that can say,
hey doctor drew,

1714
01:31:57.060 --> 01:32:00.400
listen man,
marijuana has made me a better person.
I'm a,
I'm a different

1715
01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:03.090
<v 1>person because of it.
Okay,
so,
so what do you think it is?
He'll be,</v>

1716
01:32:03.130 --> 01:32:06.040
you could be as a person anyway.
It's either one of two things.
Either.

1717
01:32:06.070 --> 01:32:10.000
He actually doesn't know.
That doesn't meet as good for you or he knows,

1718
01:32:10.001 --> 01:32:13.060
but because he's a doctor,
he doesn't want to hurt his reputation.
No.
Look,

1719
01:32:13.061 --> 01:32:15.700
he'll tell you it's better for you than alcohol for sure.
I mean,
yeah,

1720
01:32:15.910 --> 01:32:18.750
but does he know the truth?
Medical,
he's very honest.
He has another,
doesn't know.

1721
01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:22.210
He believes that it's bad for you and he,
you know,
he believes that a,

1722
01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:25.830
it's a addictive,
whether it's physically a diff addictive or psychologically,

1723
01:32:26.110 --> 01:32:29.680
it's really no.
You know,
when people say there's no,
marijuana is not addictive.

1724
01:32:29.710 --> 01:32:32.980
Everything you fucking do can be addictive.
If your mind is broken,

1725
01:32:33.310 --> 01:32:35.860
if your mind gets wacky,
you know,
I've seen people,
you're,
you know,

1726
01:32:35.861 --> 01:32:38.350
anybody that's a gambling addict.
Given that people like that,

1727
01:32:38.410 --> 01:32:41.530
I know a few people personally.
Yeah,
see it's a nutty thing,
right?

1728
01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:43.720
They can help them and they,
they,
they,
whatever it is,

1729
01:32:43.721 --> 01:32:47.590
you can call it a psychological addiction.
Whatever it is.
They are connected.

1730
01:32:47.591 --> 01:32:50.110
The gambling,
they can't stop gambling.
They do it all the time.

1731
01:32:50.111 --> 01:32:54.120
I know a bunch of people from the pool world,
from my days of playing pool there.

1732
01:32:54.190 --> 01:32:56.350
I've met so many people that were gambling addicts.
That's,

1733
01:32:56.380 --> 01:33:00.640
that's an addict addiction to man.
Marijuana can be addictive.
Absolutely.

1734
01:33:00.730 --> 01:33:03.010
Anything can be addictive if your mind is broken.

1735
01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:06.640
But that doesn't mean that people like us whose brains aren't broken shouldn't

1736
01:33:06.641 --> 01:33:09.730
be allowed to use it.
That's,
that's where it gets annoying.

1737
01:33:09.790 --> 01:33:12.880
And when NFA to benefit you and when you tell him that it does,

1738
01:33:12.910 --> 01:33:15.070
there should be some sort of a test and we tell them that it does.

1739
01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:18.250
That's the only thing that ever annoys me about doctor Joe said he's not willing

1740
01:33:18.251 --> 01:33:20.590
to sort of take that into consideration.
He,

1741
01:33:20.591 --> 01:33:24.640
he's a pretty rigid on his stance when it comes to to psychedelic drugs and to

1742
01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:28.870
test that.
That's the only part that I can't stand as he,
he's,
he's,

1743
01:33:28.930 --> 01:33:32.560
does it know the truth about marijuana?
I thought maybe he does know,

1744
01:33:32.561 --> 01:33:34.660
but he's just trying to save his job and he can't talk about it because

1745
01:33:34.661 --> 01:33:36.700
technically it's still illegal so I can't promote it.

1746
01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:39.640
I thought it was that and like he did know the truth,
but either way,

1747
01:33:39.641 --> 01:33:43.150
that would still be something that I wasn't,
I wouldn't be happy with.
I'm like,

1748
01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:47.350
did do the research,
get on,
get on the Internet,
Dr Julia a doctor,
come on,

1749
01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:52.340
look into it.
It's going to,
you'll actually benefit from it.
You Yourself,
yes,

1750
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:54.560
you will benefit from it.
Most certainly adopted.

1751
01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:58.180
Just started smoking weed every now and then your life would change in a better

1752
01:33:58.181 --> 01:34:01.780
way.
Doctor drew and you don't even know it.
And you're a doctor and you're on TV.

1753
01:34:01.781 --> 01:34:04.060
Man,
I love you.
I've been listening to you from love line,

1754
01:34:04.061 --> 01:34:08.800
from back when I in 1989 back in the day.
I love doctor [inaudible].

1755
01:34:08.820 --> 01:34:12.910
I love 90% of what you say,
but the 10% about the,

1756
01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:17.440
the um,
uh,
you not knowing the truth about marijuana that,

1757
01:34:17.550 --> 01:34:19.840
that burns me in inside Bhutan.

1758
01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:23.290
Mccormick school them on Loveline years ago when he was talking about it,

1759
01:34:23.291 --> 01:34:28.210
you know,
he's,
he's,
he's definitely not,
uh,
not objective when it comes to that,

1760
01:34:28.450 --> 01:34:32.290
but I,
you know,
whatever,
that's him.
That's what you know,
it's the path he's on.

1761
01:34:32.590 --> 01:34:34.150
It's unfortunate.
I think you would,

1762
01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:37.330
I think all people can learn from psychedelic experiences if you're,

1763
01:34:37.331 --> 01:34:38.300
if you're not fucked up,
there's,

1764
01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:40.480
if there's not something wrong with you medically,

1765
01:34:40.490 --> 01:34:43.090
there's not something wrong and you psychologically where you really can't go on

1766
01:34:43.091 --> 01:34:45.640
trips.
You know,
even just trips of eating weed,

1767
01:34:45.670 --> 01:34:49.780
that shit you benefits you greatly in Brazil where Iowasca is legal.

1768
01:34:49.930 --> 01:34:54.220
The people that are part of the IOWASCA churches and they're just normal loving

1769
01:34:54.221 --> 01:34:58.070
people.
They give Iowasca to their kids

1770
01:34:58.070 --> 01:35:03.070
<v 2>when they turn 14 to make sure that will become alcoholics cause I lost at that</v>

1771
01:35:03.411 --> 01:35:05.870
age.
Right when the hitting puberty,
it's sets them,

1772
01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:10.470
it sets the brain straight somehow.
And I Wasco,
if you know what it is,
it's a,

1773
01:35:10.610 --> 01:35:14.720
it's a,
it's a,
it's the key to the other side,
to the spirit world.
It really is.

1774
01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:19.840
And when you see the spirit world at 14 somehow it,
it keeps them from,

1775
01:35:19.841 --> 01:35:21.680
from being alcoholics.
They do that in Brazil.

1776
01:35:21.790 --> 01:35:24.860
<v 3>Straightens you out man.
When you,
when you've had experiences like the,</v>

1777
01:35:24.861 --> 01:35:28.900
the DMT experience,
which if people don't know Iowasca is the DMT experience.

1778
01:35:29.410 --> 01:35:34.410
Iowasca is an orally active version of DMT and the reason it's orally active as

1779
01:35:34.811 --> 01:35:36.820
opposed to the regular version is that DMT,

1780
01:35:36.821 --> 01:35:40.930
when you eat it is broken down your stomach by something called the monoamine

1781
01:35:40.931 --> 01:35:44.830
oxidase and Mano Aiming Oxidase,
um,
is a,

1782
01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:48.550
is produced by your stomach and it kills it so you,
when you eat it,

1783
01:35:48.551 --> 01:35:52.660
nothing happens.
So what these people figured out how to do,
and this is app,

1784
01:35:52.690 --> 01:35:56.050
there's hundreds of thousands of different plants in the Amazon figured out how

1785
01:35:56.051 --> 01:36:01.051
to take the route of one tree and the leaves of another and they combine them

1786
01:36:01.751 --> 01:36:06.430
and one of them has DMT and the other one has an unnatural m,

1787
01:36:06.431 --> 01:36:08.770
a o Mano,
Amy and oxidase inhibitor.

1788
01:36:08.830 --> 01:36:12.310
So it inhibits your stomachs production of monoamine oxidase.

1789
01:36:12.430 --> 01:36:15.580
And it allows a DMT to get into your bloodstream orally or,

1790
01:36:15.610 --> 01:36:16.990
and it takes a long time.

1791
01:36:16.991 --> 01:36:20.160
It takes like five or six hours for the full trip and it's,

1792
01:36:20.161 --> 01:36:22.660
it's like a ride through to the other side.
It's like,

1793
01:36:22.661 --> 01:36:27.661
it allows you during that brief amount of time to tune in to the spirit world,

1794
01:36:27.820 --> 01:36:31.570
which is all around us all the time.
And you know,
it's a,

1795
01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:35.680
it's a huge part of their culture and it's been something that has,
you know,

1796
01:36:35.870 --> 01:36:39.580
been passed on from generation to generation and it's a really incredible

1797
01:36:39.581 --> 01:36:41.860
discovery because they figured out an all those plants,

1798
01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:44.830
they figure out how to take this,
a little bit of this,
a little bit of that,

1799
01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:48.730
mix it together,
boil it's strain it out,
drink it,
throw up.

1800
01:36:48.731 --> 01:36:53.170
It tastes like dog shit tastes terrible.
It's a long ass process to make this.

1801
01:36:53.410 --> 01:36:54.790
But they figured out how to do this.

1802
01:36:55.090 --> 01:36:58.030
It's a really amazing discovery because they didn't figure out anything else.

1803
01:36:58.031 --> 01:37:01.300
They have dirt floors and shit.
They don't even have shoes yet.
They're out there.

1804
01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:05.840
Make an IOWASCA connecting to the spirit world on a regular basis.
And you know,

1805
01:37:05.841 --> 01:37:10.060
when you,
you say,
well we're advanced,
you know those,
those are those poor people.

1806
01:37:10.061 --> 01:37:13.330
They're not advanced.
Well,
they're way more advanced.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1807
01:37:13.331 --> 01:37:15.130
They don't have supermarkets,
but guess what?

1808
01:37:15.131 --> 01:37:17.500
They live in a place where food is everywhere.
Okay.

1809
01:37:17.770 --> 01:37:20.020
And they go to the spirit world all the time,

1810
01:37:20.170 --> 01:37:22.360
like they're completely connected to the afterlife.

1811
01:37:22.570 --> 01:37:26.080
If anybody realizes that this is all just a bullshit good time and just try to

1812
01:37:26.260 --> 01:37:28.030
enjoy it as much as you can.
They do.

1813
01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:30.760
Those fucking people are knocking on the door every day.

1814
01:37:30.761 --> 01:37:32.470
They're there going back and forth all the time.

1815
01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:33.730
<v 2>They're not lost in the jungle.</v>

1816
01:37:33.731 --> 01:37:36.610
They're completely aware of Western civilization and technology.

1817
01:37:36.611 --> 01:37:39.490
They know all about it.
Once you go to the other side,

1818
01:37:40.210 --> 01:37:43.570
apparently you realize all that matters is,

1819
01:37:43.750 --> 01:37:45.880
is being harmonious with Mother Nature.

1820
01:37:45.940 --> 01:37:49.030
And once you see the spirit world and you see it so clearly,

1821
01:37:50.230 --> 01:37:54.910
like all the materialistic stuff in the world apparently seems to not be so

1822
01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:59.060
anymore.
Your priorities change up and you know it.

1823
01:37:59.550 --> 01:38:04.160
I didn't do Iowasca I did the real,
I,
I sloped DMT with,
um,

1824
01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:07.960
that's the 10 minute version of an eight hour trip.
What's actually much of,

1825
01:38:07.961 --> 01:38:12.690
it's very,
very difficult to get the full DMT experience when you're drinking.

1826
01:38:12.691 --> 01:38:15.720
Iowasca it's a long experience,
but it's not a slow,

1827
01:38:16.050 --> 01:38:19.290
Mckenna always described it as like,
uh,
you know,
like you,

1828
01:38:19.300 --> 01:38:24.210
you compress a file and then you download it and then you uncompress it on your

1829
01:38:24.211 --> 01:38:28.050
hard drive and it becomes fucking huge.
You know?
He's like,
that's what DMTs like,

1830
01:38:28.051 --> 01:38:28.651
it's like you're,

1831
01:38:28.651 --> 01:38:32.390
you're downloading something that it's just going to explode in your brain and

1832
01:38:32.490 --> 01:38:36.960
you know,
and,
and Un unhinge and,
uh,
you know,

1833
01:38:36.961 --> 01:38:38.430
give you the full effect in 10,

1834
01:38:38.431 --> 01:38:42.180
15 minutes as opposed to the IOWASCA trip changed my life and I don't want to

1835
01:38:42.181 --> 01:38:44.730
get into change.
Mine too.
And we've talked about it a bunch of times.

1836
01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:48.050
I have done it a bunch of times.
To me it confirming,

1837
01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:53.360
I grew up very religious and then at 10 when I found out that everybody wasn't

1838
01:38:53.581 --> 01:38:55.110
Catholic,
I thought everybody was Catholic.

1839
01:38:55.111 --> 01:38:56.490
Everybody in my neighborhood was Catholic.

1840
01:38:56.491 --> 01:38:59.250
We had a couple of Protestants in the school.
I didn't know what that was.

1841
01:38:59.251 --> 01:39:00.150
I was a little confused.

1842
01:39:00.270 --> 01:39:02.700
And then we had a couple of Jehovah's witness and I was like,
hmm.

1843
01:39:02.940 --> 01:39:04.530
But mostly everybody was Catholic.

1844
01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:09.060
All of the sitcoms that the kids watched back then coincided with Catholic

1845
01:39:09.061 --> 01:39:11.670
holiday.
So we see Christmas specials and we see Easter.

1846
01:39:11.850 --> 01:39:15.180
So I just thought everybody was Catholic.
You know,
I was an altar boy.
I'm like,

1847
01:39:15.181 --> 01:39:17.490
I can't wait to get to heaven cause lat life sucks.

1848
01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:22.050
Once I found out that there was Jews out there and I found out,
I'm like,

1849
01:39:22.051 --> 01:39:24.120
what's a Jew is?
Is that a person?
Oh No,

1850
01:39:24.121 --> 01:39:25.800
it's a religion and there's other religions.

1851
01:39:25.801 --> 01:39:29.490
Then I became a atheist once I found out there was a thousand religions and I

1852
01:39:29.491 --> 01:39:32.520
went,
oh,
it's this muscly,
all be bullshit,
you know?

1853
01:39:32.521 --> 01:39:35.760
So then I became super atheistic,
started writing songs about Satan.

1854
01:39:35.790 --> 01:39:37.110
I didn't believe in Satan,
but I'm like,

1855
01:39:37.140 --> 01:39:39.540
I don't believe in anything and I'm going to scare all these Christians and I'm

1856
01:39:39.541 --> 01:39:43.470
a write about Satan killing priests and stuff.
Didn't I was an atheist.

1857
01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:46.920
I mean I was,
I didn't believe in God at all.
And then when I was at 21,

1858
01:39:47.130 --> 01:39:51.150
I had an experience that made me realize that there might be some stuff out

1859
01:39:51.151 --> 01:39:55.830
there.
Um,
should I tell the psychic story?
Oh,
tell whatever you want,
man.

1860
01:39:56.120 --> 01:40:00.310
Um,
well that's an interesting story when from atheism to egg,
uh,

1861
01:40:00.420 --> 01:40:05.420
being an agnostic at 21 was wa I'm just moved to Hollywood to be a rock star and

1862
01:40:05.730 --> 01:40:10.110
walking up sunset boulevard passing the Roxy and my buddy John was like 10,

1863
01:40:10.111 --> 01:40:14.910
15 yards ahead of me.
And in front of the Roxy there's this hippie plan.

1864
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:17.010
Um,
he's playing guitar and he's,

1865
01:40:17.011 --> 01:40:20.880
and he has this sign about the Amazon rain forest getting chopped down and all

1866
01:40:20.881 --> 01:40:22.530
this stuff and he's just a dirty hippy to me.

1867
01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:24.780
And I pass by and he's all tree hugging.

1868
01:40:24.930 --> 01:40:28.590
And I looked at him and in my mind I'm like,
you know,
take a shower.

1869
01:40:28.591 --> 01:40:31.530
But I didn't actually say that.
And as if he read my mind,
he stopped playing,

1870
01:40:31.531 --> 01:40:34.950
walked up to me,
looked me in the face and said,
if I guessed your birthday,

1871
01:40:35.070 --> 01:40:37.290
will you listen to me?
And I'm like,
yeah,
right.

1872
01:40:37.350 --> 01:40:40.290
And he looked at me in the eye and said,
fine.
He said,
May,

1873
01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:46.950
May 15th I'm like,
Holy Shit.
I said,
John,
John,
come here.
I,

1874
01:40:47.070 --> 01:40:50.070
I waved my friend over and I as if that wasn't enough.

1875
01:40:50.190 --> 01:40:54.190
He had to do it again for the confirmation.
I said,
guess his birthday and John

1876
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:56.350
<v 1>didn't know what that was going on.
He said he looked at John and said,</v>

1877
01:40:56.351 --> 01:40:59.780
March 30 31st Mike,
Mike,
Mike,

1878
01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:04.600
Mike is the probabilities.
Yeah,
let's look at probability,
probability,

1879
01:41:04.601 --> 01:41:07.480
theater,
probability,
theory.
Remember that conversation?

1880
01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:10.530
We had a conversation with a friend of ours at that point he was telling his

1881
01:41:10.531 --> 01:41:13.690
story and the guy goes,
might it's probabilities,
probability theory.

1882
01:41:13.900 --> 01:41:15.640
If you follow probability theory,

1883
01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:19.030
there's a way to do that so you can figure out someone's birthday.
I mean,

1884
01:41:19.031 --> 01:41:20.740
what the fuck are you talking about man?

1885
01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:23.830
You can't just guess one day and then another guy comes over.

1886
01:41:23.831 --> 01:41:27.610
He gets that day too though.
That's insane.
That's our probability theory.

1887
01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:31.180
Probability theory says it's very unlikely that you would be able to do that.

1888
01:41:31.210 --> 01:41:33.490
Yeah,
so he started talking about the rain forest.

1889
01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:35.830
We just stood there with our jaws dropped.

1890
01:41:35.831 --> 01:41:38.440
I didn't listen to anything he said all I kept thinking about it,

1891
01:41:38.441 --> 01:41:43.030
how the hell did he do that?
I was amazing.
So I came to a conclusion,

1892
01:41:43.330 --> 01:41:44.800
it's gotta be one of two things.

1893
01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:48.850
Either he could somehow read thoughts and if you think something,

1894
01:41:48.910 --> 01:41:51.220
there's people that could see the thoughts somehow.

1895
01:41:51.221 --> 01:41:55.720
It's like a weird other sense or there was some voice,

1896
01:41:55.721 --> 01:42:00.610
whether it's an angel or a demon or a spirit or whatever,
or the akashic records.

1897
01:42:01.410 --> 01:42:05.130
It's something telling him.
And then he had had,

1898
01:42:05.140 --> 01:42:06.760
so to me I became agnostic,

1899
01:42:06.761 --> 01:42:10.070
which meant I'm like okay maybe I don't know what the fuck is going on.

1900
01:42:10.071 --> 01:42:12.820
And how old were you when this happened?
I was 21 so what do you think happened?

1901
01:42:12.821 --> 01:42:15.970
He seen that dude was doing Iowasca and he just tripped all the time and had

1902
01:42:15.971 --> 01:42:16.550
some sort of a,

1903
01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:20.650
a constant connection to the spirit world who's running around being selfless.

1904
01:42:20.651 --> 01:42:23.890
Only trying to help people and looking like a bum.
Yup.
Cause if he's,

1905
01:42:24.250 --> 01:42:27.580
if he's dedicating his life to saving the rainforest,
he's got like,

1906
01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:32.110
she's super over active when it comes to like loving the planet.

1907
01:42:32.111 --> 01:42:35.800
Like he loves the planet so much that he's dedicated his whole life.

1908
01:42:35.801 --> 01:42:38.740
He's not taking showers.
He's on the sunset playing guitar.

1909
01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:42.130
He's dedicated his whole life.
That guy,
that guy.

1910
01:42:42.190 --> 01:42:45.190
Nobody loves the planet more than that dude.
You know,

1911
01:42:45.250 --> 01:42:50.200
I was listening to a Mckenna,
uh,
podcast,
uh,
I forget psychedelic cafe,

1912
01:42:50.201 --> 01:42:51.420
I think is the name of the podcast.

1913
01:42:51.421 --> 01:42:53.840
And I had a Terence Mckenna speech where he was talking about it.

1914
01:42:53.841 --> 01:42:57.760
Everybody's so concerned about the rain forest and everyone's so concerned about

1915
01:42:57.790 --> 01:43:01.570
the environment and pollution and toxifications of the ocean.

1916
01:43:01.930 --> 01:43:03.070
But if just one,

1917
01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:07.630
just one of these things and has hit the earth so many times in the past came

1918
01:43:07.631 --> 01:43:11.320
here from outer space,
you wouldn't have to worry about anything anymore.

1919
01:43:11.350 --> 01:43:14.050
There'd be nothing left.
You know,
he's talking about though the,

1920
01:43:14.051 --> 01:43:18.640
the media that hit the Yucatan and how that within the first,
second and a half,

1921
01:43:18.670 --> 01:43:23.130
it was five miles deep into the earth for

1922
01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:29.740
the first,
second and a half.
It was five miles deep.

1923
01:43:30.980 --> 01:43:35.320
And that's dead.
Fuck the ozone layer.
Fuck the rain forest.
Fuck everything.

1924
01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:37.210
It's all done.
And those,
Goddamn,

1925
01:43:37.270 --> 01:43:41.620
every planet is littered with these giant craters.
They're all over Jupiter.

1926
01:43:41.621 --> 01:43:45.390
There all we've seen them hit in our lifetime and he knows an amateur astronomer

1927
01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:48.820
very recently in Australia.
That caught a big impact in Jupiter.
We've seen it in,

1928
01:43:49.030 --> 01:43:52.090
you know,
we,
we,
we seen them hip Jupiter before.
Um,

1929
01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:56.450
<v 2>there was one big one I believe in [inaudible] 94,
you know,
shoemaker Levy.</v>

1930
01:43:56.451 --> 01:43:58.940
I think it was a big comment that slammed in.
I mean,
look,

1931
01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:02.930
it's some scary ass fucking shit and there's so many of 'em out there.

1932
01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:05.000
There's so many of them that didn't,

1933
01:44:05.060 --> 01:44:09.950
that incident didn't make me become a tree hugger,
but it did make me,
um,
uh,

1934
01:44:09.951 --> 01:44:13.250
did put me on a quest to find out.
Like,

1935
01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:17.480
I just instantly became fascinated at how we can get that.
What do you think?

1936
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:19.980
I mean,
you had to be,
you had a think about that gun?

1937
01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:24.010
I said it was either to me it was either he could read thought either.
Whatever.

1938
01:44:24.011 --> 01:44:29.000
Did you ask her?
No,
I didn't ask him.
Whoa.
Either.
Either.
He,

1939
01:44:29.060 --> 01:44:33.890
why didn't you ask him?
I don't.
Maybe I did.
And he said,
don't worry about it.

1940
01:44:33.930 --> 01:44:37.890
You know,
I just know it can hold them back on the ability to run.

1941
01:44:38.050 --> 01:44:42.440
I just know something.
So to me,
this shit,
to me,

1942
01:44:42.441 --> 01:44:45.530
he did it.
It didn't matter how he did it.
I wouldn't even let him talk anymore.

1943
01:44:45.531 --> 01:44:49.940
I'd be like,
come on bitch.
Yeah,
spread that shit around.
I want to know numbers.

1944
01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:51.033
Um,

1945
01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:56.800
I just knew that that had to be something that we don't understand,

1946
01:44:56.840 --> 01:44:58.730
that it has to be like another dimension or something.

1947
01:44:58.910 --> 01:45:03.740
So I became obsessed with finding out what life really is.
You know,

1948
01:45:03.741 --> 01:45:06.650
I've just always been on that quest.
That's how I became a conspiracy theorists.

1949
01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:09.040
That's why,
you know,
um,
you know,
uh,

1950
01:45:09.110 --> 01:45:12.170
fascinated with ancient cultures and what they did.
I'm old,

1951
01:45:12.171 --> 01:45:14.690
I have stacks and stacks of DVDs just like you,

1952
01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:18.410
stacks of DVDs of conspiracy theories and uh,
you know,

1953
01:45:19.580 --> 01:45:22.510
documentaries on ancient cultures and you know,

1954
01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:26.330
the government and how the government works at all this stuff that set me on the

1955
01:45:26.331 --> 01:45:30.920
course right there to find out,
uh,
what's really going on.
Is there an afterlife?

1956
01:45:30.921 --> 01:45:34.580
I mean that's important.
It became important to me to find out if there is,

1957
01:45:34.730 --> 01:45:39.200
if the,
is there some kind of higher power,
you know,
so that set it up.

1958
01:45:39.290 --> 01:45:44.290
So I became agnostic and through DMT and all the things that I've been through,

1959
01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:46.533
um,

1960
01:45:46.790 --> 01:45:50.570
to me I feel I'm pretty certain there's an afterlife that we don't just die and

1961
01:45:50.571 --> 01:45:54.560
just were just done.
I believe that there is,

1962
01:45:55.070 --> 01:45:59.510
there is the Akashic records and the ancient Indians believed I'm from India.

1963
01:45:59.660 --> 01:46:01.550
They believe,
you know,
they call,
they dubbed it.

1964
01:46:01.551 --> 01:46:06.260
The akashic records is there's in the afterworld there's a river of infinite

1965
01:46:06.261 --> 01:46:11.261
information that you can have access to the answers to everything and you know,

1966
01:46:11.481 --> 01:46:15.440
through meditation and just sort of controlling your own frequency.
You know,

1967
01:46:15.441 --> 01:46:18.990
people have done it.
It's,
it's,
it's been done.
There's been,

1968
01:46:19.090 --> 01:46:22.340
the most famous in the West was Edgar Casey.

1969
01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:26.270
He had the knowledge to tap into this information and no one can figure it out.

1970
01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:31.250
He has like 13 or 14,000 documented readings.
He got huge.

1971
01:46:31.251 --> 01:46:33.620
The president came to him,
he was,
you know,

1972
01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:36.050
he was a guy with a third grade education,

1973
01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:41.240
but when he went under and is medium state,
he had the answers to everything.

1974
01:46:41.630 --> 01:46:44.180
He was like this,
like this,
this man in a,

1975
01:46:44.270 --> 01:46:48.280
in a different voice and would just have the answers to everything.
It was,

1976
01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:50.070
if anybody debunked

1977
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:54.420
<v 3>Edgar Casey.
Oh right.
Read any of that shit.
You can't debunk him.
He smashes you.</v>

1978
01:46:54.421 --> 01:46:55.830
Just look into him.
He smashes,

1979
01:46:55.970 --> 01:47:00.970
she knew in 1920 he knew like the function of every gland and no one knew if he

1980
01:47:02.581 --> 01:47:05.910
was bullshitting cause they didn't even know back then.
We're finding the shit.

1981
01:47:05.911 --> 01:47:10.200
He's saying we're finding out the shit now.
But he was right.
He did.

1982
01:47:10.290 --> 01:47:14.760
He would rattle off like the pituitary gland and give you like what vitamins you

1983
01:47:14.761 --> 01:47:17.640
need to take,
what's its function going through all the glands and people with,

1984
01:47:17.641 --> 01:47:18.750
oh,
he's crazy.

1985
01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:22.650
But he had a documented mds are going back and studying in his,

1986
01:47:22.740 --> 01:47:27.720
his readings and going,
Holy Shit,
there's,
you can't debunk him.
He had the power,

1987
01:47:27.750 --> 01:47:30.990
he had the power to reach and he's not the only one.

1988
01:47:30.991 --> 01:47:34.420
There's a lot of people that can do,
do you know meditation helps,
you know,

1989
01:47:34.430 --> 01:47:38.700
you yourself have even said through a meditating in your tank that you feel like

1990
01:47:38.701 --> 01:47:41.910
you have access to information.
Well,
I definitely feel like the,

1991
01:47:41.940 --> 01:47:46.940
the closer you get to being at peace and in the right frequency and then you can

1992
01:47:47.041 --> 01:47:49.200
direct your frequency.
I really do believe that.

1993
01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:52.170
I believe that with the tank and with,

1994
01:47:52.380 --> 01:47:56.760
especially if I go onto the tank under the influence of the sacred plant and I

1995
01:47:56.761 --> 01:48:00.150
and I and I,
and I get into the groove of,
of completely,

1996
01:48:00.151 --> 01:48:05.151
totally letting go and and trying to abandon all that is about me and just try

1997
01:48:05.851 --> 01:48:10.110
to be empty and just tune into it.
There's a,
there's a place that I get to,

1998
01:48:10.111 --> 01:48:12.930
it's almost like our goal on this little journey and I've got to keep it

1999
01:48:12.931 --> 01:48:16.200
together while I'm going on this journey because sometimes when I'm on it,

2000
01:48:16.201 --> 01:48:17.280
it could get a little weird.

2001
01:48:17.281 --> 01:48:19.860
I start thinking about myself or about my life or about anything else,

2002
01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:21.780
and then I,
it interrupts my progress,

2003
01:48:21.900 --> 01:48:24.180
but if I can tune in and stay in long enough,

2004
01:48:24.181 --> 01:48:27.540
it's like I go through a tunnel and then when I get through the tunnel,

2005
01:48:27.570 --> 01:48:28.950
if I can keep it together,

2006
01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:31.680
I get through the tunnel and then I break on through to the other side.

2007
01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:33.540
And when I break on through to the other side,

2008
01:48:33.541 --> 01:48:35.730
it literally is like I get to another place.

2009
01:48:35.910 --> 01:48:39.220
And so I got to go through this tunnel,
this tunnel of,
of,

2010
01:48:39.420 --> 01:48:43.350
it's almost like tuning my mind into the perfect frequency and whether or not

2011
01:48:43.351 --> 01:48:47.940
I'm willing to let go of all of my control,
all my control,
my thinking,

2012
01:48:47.970 --> 01:48:52.110
and if I can,
if I can,
it's,
it's literally like a magical event,
man.

2013
01:48:52.111 --> 01:48:55.950
Why I popped through this tunnel on the other side and there's this beautiful,

2014
01:48:55.951 --> 01:49:00.720
incredible psychedelic world over there,
psychedelic world of patterns and,
and,

2015
01:49:00.780 --> 01:49:05.060
and communication.
And it's a,
it's like a mushroom trip.
It's like a DMT trip.
Yes.

2016
01:49:05.061 --> 01:49:08.880
So either a that's imaginary and it's all just in your head.

2017
01:49:08.881 --> 01:49:12.660
It's a trip or B,
it's actually some place.
Well you know the real,

2018
01:49:12.661 --> 01:49:14.730
and I don't think there is anything that's imaginary.

2019
01:49:14.730 --> 01:49:17.850
This is my thinking about the imagination.
This is what I think man.

2020
01:49:18.060 --> 01:49:20.040
Your imagination,
you're a very creative person.

2021
01:49:20.041 --> 01:49:22.200
I think of all the different things that you've thought of,
you know,

2022
01:49:22.201 --> 01:49:24.750
whether you were when we were writing shit for the man show or whether you're

2023
01:49:24.751 --> 01:49:28.050
creating Jujitsu moves,
whatever it is you think it,

2024
01:49:28.290 --> 01:49:32.430
and then it manifests itself in a,
in a real form,
as a real thing,

2025
01:49:32.460 --> 01:49:35.190
a solid object.
It was at one point in time,
just a thought,

2026
01:49:35.490 --> 01:49:38.550
like the ability to put something in a can.
Somebody had to think this up,

2027
01:49:38.551 --> 01:49:42.060
how to make a fucking can and then figure out how many coconuts you'd have to

2028
01:49:42.061 --> 01:49:45.300
squash to,
to get all this coconut juice into this camp.

2029
01:49:45.330 --> 01:49:46.770
There's a lot of work involved in that,
but you,

2030
01:49:46.771 --> 01:49:48.490
someone has to create it and think it.

2031
01:49:48.730 --> 01:49:52.690
And so the imagination allows you to think of these ideas and then they manifest

2032
01:49:52.691 --> 01:49:53.890
themselves in a real form.

2033
01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:58.510
So the real question is what the fuck is the imagination?
What,
what is,

2034
01:49:58.540 --> 01:50:02.290
what is when you're thinking things up and someone comes up with the idea of

2035
01:50:02.291 --> 01:50:05.380
nuclear power,
I mean granted there's a bunch of steps along the way.

2036
01:50:05.381 --> 01:50:07.060
A bunch of other discoveries have to be made.

2037
01:50:07.061 --> 01:50:09.430
A bunch of things have to be pieced together to get to a point where you're,

2038
01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:12.940
you know,
making a nuclear power plant or an airplane or fucking anything really

2039
01:50:12.941 --> 01:50:13.774
complicated.

2040
01:50:13.870 --> 01:50:17.980
But the bottom line is all of it has come out of nothing.

2041
01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:23.280
All of it,
every idea ever has come out of the air.
It's the imagination.

2042
01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:27.700
<v 2>So,
so what is it?
So you're saying be it's someplace.
So,</v>

2043
01:50:27.701 --> 01:50:31.090
and if you look at the ancient Indians and it,
you know,

2044
01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:34.720
is there an Akashic records?
Is there proof?
Yes,
there's a lots of proof.

2045
01:50:34.721 --> 01:50:37.120
But the undeniable proof,
you look at Edgar Casey,

2046
01:50:37.121 --> 01:50:42.121
he proves that you can somehow under hypnosis or in a trance or in meditation,

2047
01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:45.250
you can tap into this infinite knowledge,

2048
01:50:45.251 --> 01:50:47.350
these answers that came from somewhere else.

2049
01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:52.560
So if there is this infinite river of knowledge or,

2050
01:50:52.830 --> 01:50:57.610
um,
what the hell is it?
Who created it?
What's it for?

2051
01:50:57.730 --> 01:51:02.710
Is there,
is there consciousness behind it?
Get something created?

2052
01:51:02.740 --> 01:51:06.070
Is there,
do we,
when we exist in the spirit world,
our,

2053
01:51:06.071 --> 01:51:10.590
we'd like this super infinite.
I mean cause if you listened to the,
the,

2054
01:51:10.591 --> 01:51:13.900
the mystics and ancient cultures,
the mediums,

2055
01:51:14.130 --> 01:51:18.330
if you look at all the things they all agree on,
they all say,
and even tenants,

2056
01:51:18.350 --> 01:51:22.420
the Kenya has said this,
that in the afterlife and the other dimension,

2057
01:51:22.470 --> 01:51:25.000
there is no time.
There's no path,
there's no presence.

2058
01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:27.940
There's just now everything happens at the same time.

2059
01:51:28.180 --> 01:51:31.840
No human can actually understand that or understand what that feels.

2060
01:51:31.841 --> 01:51:34.480
They can't wrap their brain around it.
I can't,
I can say it,

2061
01:51:34.481 --> 01:51:38.290
but I don't really know what it feels like.
But that's what they all say.

2062
01:51:38.410 --> 01:51:43.270
There is no time.
And this dimension that we're living in is an illusion of time.

2063
01:51:43.450 --> 01:51:46.660
We see that as time moves into linear,
a linear fashion.

2064
01:51:46.661 --> 01:51:50.440
So we perceive it as time and like what does that really mean?

2065
01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:53.800
This is an illusion really.
Like what could it mean?

2066
01:51:53.890 --> 01:51:57.130
And if there is this river of infinite knowledge,
God dammit,

2067
01:51:57.250 --> 01:52:02.250
whatever created that for sure is there's some intelligent design going on like

2068
01:52:02.740 --> 01:52:05.030
that's what I'm coming.
That's the conclusion I'm coming to.

2069
01:52:05.290 --> 01:52:08.400
That's not just some natural phenomena where there's infinite knowledge of

2070
01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:10.450
certain people in our meditation can tap into it.

2071
01:52:10.630 --> 01:52:15.630
That sounds like there's some awesome shit that created that for multiple

2072
01:52:15.881 --> 01:52:20.170
dimensions.
Right?
Right.
If it exists and then you backtrack,
they it exist.
Yes.

2073
01:52:20.171 --> 01:52:23.860
There's lots of proof that it is there.
People are taking information.

2074
01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:26.170
The guy who gets my birthday on my friend's birthday,

2075
01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:29.350
he tapped into this infinite river of knowledge.

2076
01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:33.400
The ancient cultures all talk about
vanguard,

2077
01:52:34.340 --> 01:52:37.860
man.
Of course there's good,
but you can call it not like the bearded man.

2078
01:52:38.120 --> 01:52:43.090
No law created like there is a higher power.
There is intelligent design.

2079
01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:46.010
There is.
This is if is what

2080
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:46.461
<v 3>we know.</v>

2081
01:52:46.461 --> 01:52:51.050
Is it that it's embarrassing for this universe if we're the smart,

2082
01:52:51.170 --> 01:52:52.890
nobody know shit.
Yeah,
but that's,

2083
01:52:53.060 --> 01:52:56.540
but that's not embarrassing because at one point in time it had to be lower than

2084
01:52:56.541 --> 01:53:00.650
us.
If the big bang actually created the universe.
At one point in time,

2085
01:53:00.651 --> 01:53:02.810
like a day old was the universe like,
God,

2086
01:53:02.811 --> 01:53:04.640
you should be embarrassed with yourself.
This is it.

2087
01:53:04.730 --> 01:53:07.760
You don't even have worms yet.
You fucking loser.
Well,
the whole universe,
if,

2088
01:53:07.761 --> 01:53:11.960
if everything evolves it at one point in time it has to be in a low form.

2089
01:53:12.140 --> 01:53:15.440
You know,
and what we are in this,
you know,
if this is a universe,

2090
01:53:15.441 --> 01:53:17.110
if this is a dimension,
you know what,
what,

2091
01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:20.240
whatever you want to classify this space that we dwell in,
you know,

2092
01:53:20.241 --> 01:53:22.760
whether when do you think it's one part of the great beyond,

2093
01:53:22.761 --> 01:53:26.270
it's all attached together.
Whatever the fuck it is.
This part is at this stage,

2094
01:53:26.300 --> 01:53:29.090
this is where it is,
you know,
as embarrassing as what we are right now,

2095
01:53:29.210 --> 01:53:32.000
this may very well be as far as it gets.
Maybe.
I mean,

2096
01:53:32.001 --> 01:53:35.780
if we think that there are aliens and we think that aliens at one point in time

2097
01:53:35.781 --> 01:53:37.280
used to be a,
you know,

2098
01:53:37.281 --> 01:53:40.070
a like us and then they evolved and became much better than us.

2099
01:53:40.310 --> 01:53:43.310
Well that means they had to be,
like I said,
at one point,
for sure somebody,

2100
01:53:43.311 --> 01:53:46.400
somebody that the,
the,
the,
the,
the fucking top of the line,

2101
01:53:46.401 --> 01:53:49.370
the front of the line had to be like us at one point in time.

2102
01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:52.640
There's no argument revolution.
Maybe it's obsolete.
It might be us.

2103
01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:56.870
Even an evolution and a higher power and intelligent design at the same time.

2104
01:53:56.880 --> 01:54:00.260
How could trippy would that be though is we really were the top of the line as

2105
01:54:00.261 --> 01:54:02.150
far as intelligence goes,
as far as the universe.

2106
01:54:02.180 --> 01:54:06.260
What if we really are the only one that would be a trip man.
Ridiculous.
Hey,

2107
01:54:06.270 --> 01:54:09.470
wouldn't be incredible.
It would mean,
it sounds,
it sounds ridiculous.

2108
01:54:10.210 --> 01:54:14.090
Cogs that we,
oh,
we're number one.
We're lucky.
But here's the thing.

2109
01:54:14.091 --> 01:54:18.460
It had to happen somewhere once,
right?
If it's,
if it happens here,
right?
If we,

2110
01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:23.210
if we are the ones and we've gotten to this point then just because I'm not

2111
01:54:23.211 --> 01:54:25.160
saying this right,
but because it's happening here,

2112
01:54:25.161 --> 01:54:27.020
it doesn't mean that it's happening somewhere else.

2113
01:54:27.050 --> 01:54:31.190
It might literally only be happening here.
I believe that I believe in evolution.

2114
01:54:31.191 --> 01:54:33.050
Absolutely.
I mean there's so much proof of it,

2115
01:54:33.170 --> 01:54:37.700
but there's also like these inconsistencies with it too and like the missing

2116
01:54:37.780 --> 01:54:41.510
Lincoln and they don't come out of that is just a lack of understanding on a,

2117
01:54:41.660 --> 01:54:44.470
on a,
on a slope.
I believe that there is,
if there's an,

2118
01:54:44.471 --> 01:54:47.450
if there's an akashic records,
if there's an infinite river of knowledge,

2119
01:54:48.290 --> 01:54:50.770
there's an a,
there's definitely,
in my eyes,
the,

2120
01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:54.410
the conclusion would be that that there is a higher power with higher

2121
01:54:54.411 --> 01:54:58.670
intelligence than what were were someone else.
We're not creating that shit.

2122
01:54:58.760 --> 01:54:59.541
Somebody created that.

2123
01:54:59.541 --> 01:55:02.390
We can't fucking make an infinite river knowledge that we can just grab it like

2124
01:55:02.391 --> 01:55:04.430
a supercomputer.
We're still on that tops.

2125
01:55:04.820 --> 01:55:09.590
I'm saying that that proves that there's something way beyond us.

2126
01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:11.690
Wavy on might not be that simple.

2127
01:55:11.691 --> 01:55:16.370
It might be something like we're moving towards becoming that.
It might be that.

2128
01:55:16.490 --> 01:55:18.920
It might be that there is no god and there is no,

2129
01:55:19.070 --> 01:55:21.500
there's no one who's at the wheel of this whole thing,

2130
01:55:21.501 --> 01:55:23.540
but that the whole thing is moving in a direction.

2131
01:55:23.541 --> 01:55:26.690
The way to move in the correct direction is to move towards God.

2132
01:55:26.900 --> 01:55:29.960
Who's to move towards,
loves to move towards friendship and happiness.

2133
01:55:29.961 --> 01:55:33.040
And that's why when you crack through to the next stage,
when you're,

2134
01:55:33.050 --> 01:55:35.570
when you have that DMT trip and you go over there,

2135
01:55:35.571 --> 01:55:37.670
it's like what you're trying to do is to get there,

2136
01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:40.610
but you're trying to do is to tune in to how they're tuned in.
You know?

2137
01:55:40.611 --> 01:55:44.310
And then it's not even that there's a thing behind it.
Since you are it,

2138
01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:48.670
you are that thing.
We all are that water molecules in the ocean.

2139
01:55:48.900 --> 01:55:49.710
That's,

2140
01:55:49.710 --> 01:55:54.030
that's one of the conclusions and theories based on all the shit that I've
heard.

2141
01:55:54.090 --> 01:55:57.330
It seems like the afterworld is like an ocean.

2142
01:55:57.331 --> 01:55:59.820
It is like God is one God as ocean,
but we're all part of it.

2143
01:55:59.821 --> 01:56:03.570
We're all like a water molecule.
We're all affected.
It's the ultimate mind fuck.

2144
01:56:03.630 --> 01:56:06.510
It's the ultimate mind fuck to think affect you.
You know,
and you're,

2145
01:56:06.690 --> 01:56:09.900
your own biology is sort of betraying you and to thinking that you're an

2146
01:56:09.901 --> 01:56:13.950
individual and that you're not a part of some gigantic fucking thing that's all

2147
01:56:13.951 --> 01:56:14.700
happening.

2148
01:56:14.700 --> 01:56:18.420
But one of the things that you've realized and I've realized over the course of

2149
01:56:18.421 --> 01:56:19.254
our friendship,

2150
01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:22.980
I mean Eddie has been my best friend since I think 2000 we started hanging out

2151
01:56:22.981 --> 01:56:25.200
in 2010 which is,
and that's back to the,

2152
01:56:25.201 --> 01:56:26.940
it comes back to the story of the twister.
Oh.

2153
01:56:27.050 --> 01:56:30.810
Because this is how we became good friends.
Um,
I was uh,
getting uh,
uh,

2154
01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:32.770
private lessons when I first started doing Jujitsu.

2155
01:56:32.790 --> 01:56:35.760
I was a blue belt under this dude.
I won't say his name is a very nice guy,

2156
01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:38.820
but it's an,
I'm going to say something negative and I was,

2157
01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:41.880
because I was getting a private lessons from him all the time.

2158
01:56:41.881 --> 01:56:44.820
He was the only guy that I was rolling with and I wasn't really learning nearly

2159
01:56:44.821 --> 01:56:48.030
as much as I thought.
I thought like if you're a kickboxing and like you say,

2160
01:56:48.031 --> 01:56:49.620
if you get a chance to work out with rob came in,

2161
01:56:49.740 --> 01:56:53.040
it's way better to work out with rob came in one on one than it is to go to a

2162
01:56:53.041 --> 01:56:55.530
private class.
Like he's going to correct all your techniques.

2163
01:56:55.620 --> 01:56:57.300
So I thought that would be the case with Jujitsu.

2164
01:56:57.300 --> 01:56:59.750
Like I would get really good going to class and ain't like that.

2165
01:56:59.770 --> 01:57:03.690
Eddie was the first person to tell me.
And uh,
Eddie came to a,
a,

2166
01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:06.420
one of the private lessons that I was having when Silvio and we rolled around a

2167
01:57:06.421 --> 01:57:08.280
little bit and white away.

2168
01:57:08.281 --> 01:57:11.550
He got me in a twister and I had no idea what the fuck he's doing.

2169
01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:15.300
All of a sudden he hooks my knee with his left leg and his left foot goes under

2170
01:57:15.301 --> 01:57:19.050
his right knee and he rolls forward under his left shoulder and I'm spinning

2171
01:57:19.051 --> 01:57:19.950
around like a top.

2172
01:57:20.100 --> 01:57:23.220
And next thing I know he's got my arm wrapped around his neck and he's fucking

2173
01:57:23.221 --> 01:57:26.370
pulling on my neck like this.
I was like,
what the fuck did you just do?

2174
01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:30.660
Like I had been doing Jujitsu for two years and I had no idea what the fuck you

2175
01:57:30.661 --> 01:57:33.360
just did to me.
And I was like,
God damn.
And you're like,

2176
01:57:33.361 --> 01:57:36.000
I'll teach you all this shit.
I was like,
dude,
teach me this shit.

2177
01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:40.080
And that's how we became friends.
And that's also how I started smoking pot.

2178
01:57:40.340 --> 01:57:44.190
You know,
I was on the Mark Marin podcast the other day and this came up.
Um,

2179
01:57:44.220 --> 01:57:48.480
you know,
I,
I've thought that marijuana and all that stuff was for losers.

2180
01:57:48.481 --> 01:57:51.570
I thought that it just made you a loser.
You're just going to become unmotivated.

2181
01:57:51.571 --> 01:57:52.530
You're not going to get anything done.

2182
01:57:52.531 --> 01:57:55.350
You're going to be a dummy and just sit and watch TV.
That's not what I wanted,

2183
01:57:55.351 --> 01:57:58.410
man.
I wanted to make sure we're like our friend bud.
We have a good friend,

2184
01:57:58.411 --> 01:58:02.740
but who's like super fucking go getter.
You know,
bud is a great guy.
He,

2185
01:58:02.741 --> 01:58:06.120
he's the one who put together the TV show to build that car,
that Barracuda.

2186
01:58:06.330 --> 01:58:08.970
And he's also the one who did my garage,
like an MMA garage.

2187
01:58:08.971 --> 01:58:11.850
She's always got like a bunch of different TV shows going on and he's a fucking

2188
01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:16.650
go getter and you and I are always like,
dude,
please just let us get you high.

2189
01:58:17.530 --> 01:58:21.000
How many times more than Dr Drew?
More than anybody.

2190
01:58:21.030 --> 01:58:23.640
How many times we've been having this conversation with him and he's always
like,

2191
01:58:23.641 --> 01:58:25.590
after I make my first million and then he makes his first million,

2192
01:58:25.591 --> 01:58:27.870
or like I'm still looking,
I'm like,
I don't want to slow down now.

2193
01:58:28.020 --> 01:58:29.910
Like he just does not want to slow it down and we're like,

2194
01:58:29.911 --> 01:58:32.910
it ain't about slowing down man.
It's not about,
I'm not slowing down.

2195
01:58:32.940 --> 01:58:35.640
I haven't slowed down at all.
I work more now than I ever did before.

2196
01:58:36.380 --> 01:58:37.700
I'm a busy amount of fun.
That's it.

2197
01:58:37.710 --> 01:58:41.980
Isn't that a annoying goddamn stereotype that potheads or are lazy?
We

2198
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:45.700
<v 1>get a lot of shit done,
dude.
I'm doing two podcasts a week.
I'm writing a book,</v>

2199
01:58:45.701 --> 01:58:49.390
I'm writing my standup comedy and performing stand up comedy and I'm doing

2200
01:58:49.391 --> 01:58:50.670
standup.
I'm,
I'm doing a,
the,

2201
01:58:50.671 --> 01:58:53.680
the commentary for the number one mixed martial arts organization in the fucking

2202
01:58:53.681 --> 01:58:57.040
world and I'm training Jujitsu and I'm doing kettlebells and I'm raising kids

2203
01:58:57.340 --> 01:59:00.910
and I play pool every night and I got to surf the Internet and I got to beat
off.

2204
01:59:00.911 --> 01:59:03.160
There's a lot of shit going on,
man.
There's a lot of God damn time.

2205
01:59:03.310 --> 01:59:05.680
I'm not lazy at all.
I squeeze it all into every day.

2206
01:59:05.830 --> 01:59:08.470
So when people say that potheads you know that it makes you lazy.

2207
01:59:08.860 --> 01:59:10.330
It's just a stereotype man.

2208
01:59:10.331 --> 01:59:12.940
And that was the stereotype that I thought before I met you,
man.

2209
01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:17.080
I do sleep till about 10 45 every day.
So what time do you go to bed?

2210
01:59:17.160 --> 01:59:19.360
We tell him to go to bed.
Two or three.
Yeah,
that's like eight hours.

2211
01:59:19.361 --> 01:59:20.530
That's what you're supposed to get,
man.

2212
01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:22.780
Most of these people were in bed at 10 o'clock at night.

2213
01:59:22.900 --> 01:59:24.580
That's why when they get up at six o'clock in the morning,

2214
01:59:24.581 --> 01:59:26.530
they're all impressed with themselves.
My,
yeah,
bitch,

2215
01:59:26.620 --> 01:59:29.650
I slept till one 30 in the afternoon,
but where were you at 5:00 AM?

2216
01:59:29.651 --> 01:59:32.170
I was writing the greatest bit I've ever written in my life.
Okay.

2217
01:59:32.171 --> 01:59:33.370
That's why I write my best shit.

2218
01:59:33.610 --> 01:59:36.790
I was in the fucking isolation tank traveling through the universe.
All right.

2219
01:59:36.850 --> 01:59:38.380
That's what I was doing while you were sleeping.

2220
01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:41.530
So they'll give me a hard time because my time is different than your time.

2221
01:59:41.531 --> 01:59:42.940
Like somehow or another,
you know,
you,

2222
01:59:42.941 --> 01:59:46.210
you were fucking doing yoga at 5:00 AM so you're the king.
Fuck you stupid.

2223
01:59:46.211 --> 01:59:50.570
And it's all based on farmers anyway,
based on it's based on farms.

2224
01:59:50.770 --> 01:59:53.980
You have to fucking get up early.
That's nonsense asleep.

2225
01:59:54.010 --> 01:59:57.790
The crazy thing is that Joe and I,
before we started smoking weed,

2226
01:59:57.940 --> 01:59:59.140
we were totally against it.

2227
01:59:59.141 --> 02:00:02.030
We weren't bag on stoners and we thought it made you stupid.

2228
02:00:02.290 --> 02:00:07.060
I would talk so much shit on stone or is that at 28 that's when I found out the

2229
02:00:07.061 --> 02:00:11.260
truth.
That's when I reaped the benefits of marijuana.
And then when I met Joe,

2230
02:00:11.261 --> 02:00:15.310
he was so funny.
I thought this guy's got a smoke pot.
He's so funny.

2231
02:00:15.340 --> 02:00:18.700
Like I go see him,
you know,
do stand up at the comedy store and I'm like,

2232
02:00:18.701 --> 02:00:21.880
that's that dude who transit Jonjak Machado's he tries to at my school,
Hey,

2233
02:00:21.881 --> 02:00:25.060
what's up dude,
I train at your school.
And I was like,
watch them do comedy.

2234
02:00:25.061 --> 02:00:26.980
And I thought it was Greg and he's got a smoking.

2235
02:00:27.010 --> 02:00:29.860
Eddie and I had a bunch of fortuitous meetings just out of the,

2236
02:00:29.920 --> 02:00:32.600
out of the blue before we became friends at one time,
Eddie,

2237
02:00:32.601 --> 02:00:35.410
his eyes aren't so good.
And one time we were at a,
uh,

2238
02:00:35.500 --> 02:00:37.990
at Mel's diner and it was late at night,
man,

2239
02:00:37.991 --> 02:00:42.180
it was like one o'clock in the morning.
And I'm like,
Yo,
ed,
hey,
hey,
Yo Eddie.

2240
02:00:42.370 --> 02:00:44.590
And he's like,
man,
who's this motherfucker talking to me,
man,

2241
02:00:44.591 --> 02:00:46.950
I'm going to have to fight this dude in front of my chick.
Well that's,

2242
02:00:47.020 --> 02:00:49.810
you remember that?
Oh my God,
you remember that?
Yeah,
you taught,

2243
02:00:49.811 --> 02:00:53.410
I was like some dude who's just fucking with you.
So I had it down.
I'm like,

2244
02:00:53.620 --> 02:00:55.640
I thought you were.
Cause I was with the check and I,

2245
02:00:55.760 --> 02:00:57.120
you were saying something to the check.
I got,

2246
02:00:57.121 --> 02:00:59.470
you didn't hear what I was saying and you can't see that good.

2247
02:00:59.471 --> 02:01:02.050
So you couldn't see me from a distance.
So by the time I came up to your table,

2248
02:01:02.070 --> 02:01:04.480
like who's his mother fucker?
And then you'll,
oh hey dude,

2249
02:01:06.100 --> 02:01:09.160
I didn't watch newsradio and at that point it was before a fear factor.

2250
02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:13.240
So I never watched news radio.
And so I was like,
okay,

2251
02:01:13.241 --> 02:01:16.780
I hear he's an actor or something,
like I barely remembered you.

2252
02:01:16.820 --> 02:01:20.080
But then when I saw you at the college,
that was by luck to,

2253
02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:23.340
you didn't come there with me.
You just came.
Yeah.
I was just super human.
Fran,

2254
02:01:23.350 --> 02:01:25.930
I want to go see come cause right when I started smoking weed,

2255
02:01:26.290 --> 02:01:29.880
I began to appreciate comedy way more because uh,

2256
02:01:30.410 --> 02:01:32.650
we better all of a sudden my,

2257
02:01:32.670 --> 02:01:37.210
my mind figured out how to write comedy.
Right.
When I started smoking weed,

2258
02:01:37.450 --> 02:01:40.040
I never understood.
I was fascinated with Connie,
but

2259
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:42.950
<v 2>I never understood how to put bits together.
I didn't understand the setup.</v>

2260
02:01:43.070 --> 02:01:46.430
I didn't understand the structure of comedy.
But as soon as I start smoking weed,

2261
02:01:46.580 --> 02:01:48.100
I'm like,
I know where they're doing.

2262
02:01:48.110 --> 02:01:51.140
I know what they're doing now they're doing this and they're taking that and

2263
02:01:51.141 --> 02:01:53.100
then do it.
So I understood the basic for me.

2264
02:01:53.101 --> 02:01:55.760
So I just became fascinated and then I saw you.
I'm like,

2265
02:01:56.100 --> 02:01:59.830
does that do for my Jujitsu school?
He's an actor and you killed me.

2266
02:01:59.831 --> 02:02:03.710
You were just,
you were all nothing but dick jokes and like relationship jokes,

2267
02:02:03.711 --> 02:02:06.590
chick jokes,
dating Joe.
But you would kill in it.

2268
02:02:06.680 --> 02:02:10.070
And then when you came you walked off stage.
I'm like,
hey dude,
what's up dude?

2269
02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:12.610
I know you fucking were awesome.
And then we,

2270
02:02:12.620 --> 02:02:16.010
then that's when he invited me to give him a private or something like that was

2271
02:02:16.011 --> 02:02:18.740
after you at when those taking privates with that dude.
Yeah.

2272
02:02:18.750 --> 02:02:22.100
And then you came down to class and then,
and then the,
the pot smoking began.

2273
02:02:22.130 --> 02:02:26.210
That was it.
Yeah.
You know,
it took me it,
I thought you totally smoked weed.

2274
02:02:26.211 --> 02:02:28.330
So it's us.
I tell about the story.

2275
02:02:28.620 --> 02:02:32.370
<v 3>It's kind of illegal.
Oh,
one thing.</v>

2276
02:02:32.430 --> 02:02:33.690
The one part about the story,

2277
02:02:34.270 --> 02:02:38.740
<v 2>sodomy is not,
oh
yeah,
but it's legal now.
Weed's legal now.</v>

2278
02:02:39.100 --> 02:02:39.933
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2279
02:02:40.370 --> 02:02:41.203
<v 3>Totally.</v>

2280
02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:44.960
<v 2>You're alive.
That's cryptic shit for you bitches.
Listen,</v>

2281
02:02:44.961 --> 02:02:48.290
this Goddamn podcasts been going on long enough.
If it wasn't for Eddie Bravo,

2282
02:02:48.291 --> 02:02:50.960
I would have never got into Jujitsu.
It wasn't for any bravo.

2283
02:02:50.961 --> 02:02:52.550
I'll never would have become a stoner.

2284
02:02:52.910 --> 02:02:55.970
So one of my fucking favorite human beings to walk the face of the earth.

2285
02:02:56.510 --> 02:02:57.410
He could find him on Twitter,

2286
02:02:57.520 --> 02:03:01.390
<v 3>e d d I e B r a v O on Twitter.</v>

2287
02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:04.630
And your website is 10th planet j J.
Dot Com.
Right?

2288
02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:09.040
<v 2>Yup.
I'm on the forum every day.
The new bureau forum and Brian Red Band.</v>

2289
02:03:09.041 --> 02:03:12.970
You can catch him on Twitter at Red Band Red Ban,
and please follow him.

2290
02:03:12.971 --> 02:03:17.260
He's getting very insecure.
He's got such a high desk squad iTunes rating.

2291
02:03:17.290 --> 02:03:20.260
It's like number 13 and shed.
It's blowing the fuck up,

2292
02:03:20.350 --> 02:03:22.480
but yet his goddamn Twitter.
So minuscule.

2293
02:03:23.050 --> 02:03:27.220
Well I've just surpassed the 300,000 mark bitches.
Can I say one more thing?

2294
02:03:27.540 --> 02:03:30.730
For sure.
Yeah.
Um,
we were talking about Michael Jai white earlier.

2295
02:03:30.790 --> 02:03:35.490
I just want to say that that never back down to Michael [inaudible] was a

2296
02:03:35.491 --> 02:03:38.860
producer of star director.
He wanted to make sure that it was NMA authentic,

2297
02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:43.030
so and not be anything like the first one.
So never back down to,
you know,

2298
02:03:43.031 --> 02:03:45.640
he brought me in as a consultant.
I ended up getting a little part,

2299
02:03:45.641 --> 02:03:49.690
I got a couple songs on the soundtrack,
but we did our best to make it,
uh,

2300
02:03:49.960 --> 02:03:54.100
to fill all the holes to make sure that a hardcore MMA fan could come and watch

2301
02:03:54.101 --> 02:03:57.790
this movie and couldn't poke any holes.
And there's a twister in there too.

2302
02:03:57.791 --> 02:04:00.460
I choreographed a fight when he gets a guided twister when and it seemed,

2303
02:04:00.610 --> 02:04:04.150
it seemed at that point like,
you know,
like there was no twisters in the UFC,

2304
02:04:04.151 --> 02:04:06.490
so I could see like the producers as I'm putting it together,
like,

2305
02:04:06.700 --> 02:04:10.300
are you sure we're going to do this?
I mean,
this is legit or are people going to,

2306
02:04:10.450 --> 02:04:14.550
isn't this like a double flip kick and thank God the Korean Zombie pulled out to

2307
02:04:14.560 --> 02:04:17.260
business.
So now it,
it legitimizes that part of the movie as well.

2308
02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:20.830
So there's rubber guard in the movies,
which we did our best with it.
Matt,

2309
02:04:21.010 --> 02:04:25.150
I saw a rough cut of it.
I loved it.
So cool.
All right.
This weekend,
uh,

2310
02:04:25.170 --> 02:04:29.260
Portland there with Joey Diaz,
Thursday,
Friday,

2311
02:04:29.260 --> 02:04:32.470
Saturday at the helium comedy club.
That shit is all almost sold out.

2312
02:04:32.590 --> 02:04:35.770
If you want tickets,
you've got to jump on it right now because a,

2313
02:04:35.771 --> 02:04:37.860
there was very few left of today.

2314
02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:40.680
<v 3>So,
uh,
get in there.
Thank you everybody for Seattle.</v>

2315
02:04:40.681 --> 02:04:43.260
