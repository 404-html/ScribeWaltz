<v Speaker 1>Trey,</v>

2
00:00:00.571 --> 00:00:03.720
<v Speaker 1>my daddy Joe Rogan podcast by night all day,</v>

3
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.360
<v Speaker 1>or things they disagree with.</v>

5
00:00:06.361 --> 00:00:07.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a lot of,</v>

6
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.150
<v Speaker 1>a lot riding on every aspect of fighting.</v>

7
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.920
<v Speaker 1>Like do you see the Bernard Hopkins fight?</v>

8
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:14.851
<v Speaker 1>Sad,</v>

9
00:00:14.851 --> 00:00:15.684
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

10
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.673
<v Speaker 1>That was sad.</v>

11
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.001
<v Speaker 1>Bernard Hopkins,</v>

12
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:21.280
<v Speaker 1>if 51 years old fought this kid named Joe Smith Jr.</v>

13
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.150
<v Speaker 1>If nobody's seen Joe Smith junior before,</v>

14
00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:24.870
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking,</v>

15
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>he's a killer.</v>

16
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.150
<v Speaker 1>Like Bernard Hopkins picked a killer and this kid fucked him up and his kid has</v>

17
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.470
<v Speaker 1>extra long arms.</v>

18
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.650
<v Speaker 1>He's got weird arms like his arms go below his waist.</v>

19
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.570
<v Speaker 1>I was watched him fine.</v>

20
00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:39.060
<v Speaker 1>It was like look at the length of his fucking arms.</v>

21
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.140
<v Speaker 1>Like he just,</v>

22
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.230
<v Speaker 1>he beat the shit out of Bernard and he knocked him out of the ring and Bernard</v>

23
00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:44.400
<v Speaker 1>caught them with some good shots.</v>

24
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.220
<v Speaker 1>He was timing them and he caught him with a few right hands with the kid was</v>

25
00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:48.780
<v Speaker 1>just eating them and moving forward.</v>

26
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.040
<v Speaker 1>And you know what it looks like.</v>

27
00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:51.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like when people have fake hands,</v>

28
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.600
<v Speaker 1>like the fake hand is like sticking through the shirt sleeve.</v>

29
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

30
00:00:55.471 --> 00:00:58.290
<v Speaker 1>He almost looked like a cartoon guy with his extra long arms,</v>

31
00:00:58.291 --> 00:00:59.580
<v Speaker 1>but he's a bad motherfucker.</v>

32
00:00:59.581 --> 00:01:03.570
<v Speaker 1>That guy and Bernard got knocked through the ropes and fell on his head.</v>

33
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.910
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy to watch and he got up,</v>

34
00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:07.110
<v Speaker 1>he was all disoriented,</v>

35
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.100
<v Speaker 1>didn't know what happened,</v>

36
00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:09.450
<v Speaker 1>thought he was pushed through the ropes,</v>

37
00:01:09.451 --> 00:01:13.950
<v Speaker 1>but he was punched through the ropes that got connected with like four or five</v>

38
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.770
<v Speaker 1>big shots and,</v>

39
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.860
<v Speaker 1>and the last one was a left hook on the face as Bernard was going through the</v>

40
00:01:19.861 --> 00:01:22.380
<v Speaker 1>ropes and it knocked him all the way through,</v>

41
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.540
<v Speaker 1>but it was 100% legal.</v>

42
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:25.770
<v Speaker 1>He didn't do anything wrong.</v>

43
00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:26.910
<v Speaker 1>He did everything with punches.</v>

44
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:27.121
<v Speaker 1>It would,</v>

45
00:01:27.121 --> 00:01:28.110
<v Speaker 1>none of it was a push.</v>

46
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.380
<v Speaker 1>He was just bombing on him and it just was a freak incident.</v>

47
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.980
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why cages are so much better than a ring.</v>

48
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.120
<v Speaker 1>A cage is so superior,</v>

49
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.111
<v Speaker 1>like a ring.</v>

50
00:01:37.111 --> 00:01:37.761
<v Speaker 1>It's like that,</v>

51
00:01:37.761 --> 00:01:38.100
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

52
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.440
<v Speaker 1>that possibility that you could fall through like that.</v>

53
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.550
<v Speaker 1>That's terrible.</v>

54
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.361
<v Speaker 1>That should,</v>

55
00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:45.660
<v Speaker 1>they should stop using rings and if they do use rings,</v>

56
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.970
<v Speaker 1>they should pad the shit out of the outside area.</v>

57
00:01:47.971 --> 00:01:52.260
<v Speaker 1>The fact that someone like Bernard Hopkins who's been boxing for forever can</v>

58
00:01:52.261 --> 00:01:56.370
<v Speaker 1>still get knocked through a rope like that and land on his head that that's a</v>

59
00:01:56.371 --> 00:01:56.911
<v Speaker 1>possibility.</v>

60
00:01:56.911 --> 00:02:01.890
<v Speaker 1>That's a stupid way of containing people they should have instead of ropes like</v>

61
00:02:01.891 --> 00:02:02.760
<v Speaker 1>that would,</v>

62
00:02:02.761 --> 00:02:06.210
<v Speaker 1>they should have is something that has a criss cross pattern or you can't go</v>

63
00:02:06.211 --> 00:02:10.050
<v Speaker 1>through it and you should have to just climb over it to get in it.</v>

64
00:02:10.051 --> 00:02:13.230
<v Speaker 1>It should be real simple and it should be a way that they could release the,</v>

65
00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:13.411
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

66
00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:14.244
<v Speaker 1>the ropes.</v>

67
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Like if there was a medical emergency at the end of the fight,</v>

68
00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:17.190
<v Speaker 1>it should be like a latch.</v>

69
00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:19.740
<v Speaker 1>They could pull and drop the ribs down and get somebody out.</v>

70
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.420
<v Speaker 1>But the ropes,</v>

71
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:23.250
<v Speaker 1>the way they use them now in boxing matches,</v>

72
00:02:23.251 --> 00:02:24.990
<v Speaker 1>they should fucking outlaw those.</v>

73
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.620
<v Speaker 1>The fact that Bernard Hopkins can get knocked through one like that,</v>

74
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.490
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

75
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.510
<v Speaker 1>or the very least,</v>

76
00:02:30.511 --> 00:02:31.950
<v Speaker 1>you've got to protect the outside area.</v>

77
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.320
<v Speaker 1>You got to pad the shit out of it and you had to have,</v>

78
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.870
<v Speaker 1>he should have people around and most of the time,</v>

79
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.850
<v Speaker 1>a thousand fights in a row.</v>

80
00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:40.890
<v Speaker 1>It's probably never going to come into play,</v>

81
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.300
<v Speaker 1>but the one time it does,</v>

82
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.760
<v Speaker 1>you're responsible for that guy falling through the ropes.</v>

83
00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:45.900
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking stupid.</v>

84
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.093
<v Speaker 1>Like lizard.</v>

85
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.820
<v Speaker 1>He goes flying through men.</v>

86
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.070
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

87
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.510
<v Speaker 1>it'll lengthen that kids' arms so it doesn't look,</v>

88
00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:54.330
<v Speaker 1>it looks Photoshop like his head is not the right size or something.</v>

89
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.810
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>

90
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.591
<v Speaker 1>he's built for it.</v>

91
00:02:55.591 --> 00:02:56.424
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you that.</v>

92
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.650
<v Speaker 1>He's got great genetics and works hard.</v>

93
00:02:58.651 --> 00:02:59.321
<v Speaker 1>Tough kid.</v>

94
00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Really good fighter.</v>

95
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.060
<v Speaker 1>Good Chin Line.</v>

96
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:02.171
<v Speaker 1>I liked that,</v>

97
00:03:02.171 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 1>huh?</v>

98
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:03.161
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

99
00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:03.994
<v Speaker 1>he's an animal.</v>

100
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.721
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

101
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:08.470
<v Speaker 1>I was super impressed with his poise to in fighting a guy like Bernard Hopkins.</v>

102
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:13.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean that guy stepped up in a big way and he was a two to 100 dog leaning into</v>

103
00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:13.871
<v Speaker 1>that fight,</v>

104
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:14.920
<v Speaker 1>which is really crazy.</v>

105
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.260
<v Speaker 1>WHATSAPP commit some money on that.</v>

106
00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:17.480
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>

107
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

108
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

109
00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:20.020
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty convinced that uh,</v>

110
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.020
<v Speaker 1>Bernard was going to be able to stifle him and uh,</v>

111
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.560
<v Speaker 1>turn it into like the kind of fight that Bernard likes.</v>

112
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.300
<v Speaker 1>But I wasn't sure if Bernard could win.</v>

113
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.511
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

114
00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:29.440
<v Speaker 1>it's a long time off.</v>

115
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:31.470
<v Speaker 1>Two years when you're 51 years old.</v>

116
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.470
<v Speaker 1>It's a long time off.</v>

117
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:33.453
<v Speaker 1>He still fought.</v>

118
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.443
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

119
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.550
<v Speaker 1>But at the end of the day that kid marked him,</v>

120
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.990
<v Speaker 1>he just was,</v>

121
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.700
<v Speaker 1>he was just too much and he was,</v>

122
00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:40.300
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

123
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.300
<v Speaker 1>he's a guy that would have been a real threat at any time in anyone's career.</v>

124
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:46.180
<v Speaker 1>Like he's,</v>

125
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.110
<v Speaker 1>this kid has real talent and right now he's not thought of as being the best</v>

126
00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:52.750
<v Speaker 1>fighter in the world or anything even close like that.</v>

127
00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:54.340
<v Speaker 1>But Bernard was at one point in time,</v>

128
00:03:54.341 --> 00:03:54.791
<v Speaker 1>Bernard,</v>

129
00:03:54.791 --> 00:03:56.260
<v Speaker 1>like when he beat Felix Trinidad,</v>

130
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.830
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people were saying that might be the best pound for pound box or on the</v>

131
00:03:59.831 --> 00:04:00.190
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

132
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.290
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of people thought Trinidad was going to beat him.</v>

133
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.520
<v Speaker 1>He fucked Trinidad up.</v>

134
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.110
<v Speaker 1>And then he fought Kelly Pavlick and a lot of people wrote him off against Kelly</v>

135
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.410
<v Speaker 1>Pavlik.</v>

136
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.660
<v Speaker 1>He box the shit out of Kelly Pavlick.</v>

137
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.450
<v Speaker 1>And so you look at like Bernard's legacy and you go,</v>

138
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:13.631
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

139
00:04:13.631 --> 00:04:15.520
<v Speaker 1>this is an unbelievably skillful guy.</v>

140
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.170
<v Speaker 1>But at any point in that career that Joe Kelly kid would have been a handful,</v>

141
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.220
<v Speaker 1>he's just scary.</v>

142
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.910
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

143
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:22.511
<v Speaker 1>or Joe Smith,</v>

144
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:23.200
<v Speaker 1>rather,</v>

145
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.470
<v Speaker 1>that Joe Smith junior kid would have been a handful because he's just fucking</v>

146
00:04:26.471 --> 00:04:27.304
<v Speaker 1>scary.</v>

147
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.710
<v Speaker 1>He hits hard and he's,</v>

148
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.880
<v Speaker 1>he's super accurate and he's got awesome endurance and a great work ethic.</v>

149
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.580
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking dangerous no matter what era it is.</v>

150
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.833
<v Speaker 1>And Bernard,</v>

151
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:38.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

152
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.660
<v Speaker 1>maybe Bernard would have been able to beat him in his,</v>

153
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.620
<v Speaker 1>in his prime.</v>

154
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

155
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.570
<v Speaker 1>it's totally possible.</v>

156
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.700
<v Speaker 1>It's 100% likely.</v>

157
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.271
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

160
00:04:47.441 --> 00:04:50.380
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it would have been able to land more of the punches that he landed in that</v>

161
00:04:50.381 --> 00:04:50.980
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
