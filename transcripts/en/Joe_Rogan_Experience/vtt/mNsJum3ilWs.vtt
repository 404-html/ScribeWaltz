1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.860
Yes,
my knife all day.
That's it.
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:05.610
we're live,

3
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.170
we're live with two fucking psychopathic car fanatics here

4
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.180
<v 1>in the,
the,
the lovely valley of Los Angeles.
Magnus Walker.</v>

5
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.990
And of course my friend Alex Ross from shark works who,
uh,

6
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.140
I drove his car yesterday.
I know you've driven his,
his new creation.

7
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.550
That is without a doubt the scariest car I've ever driven.

8
00:00:25.551 --> 00:00:29.300
It wasn't the best environment for it cause it was on the canyons and it's got

9
00:00:29.301 --> 00:00:30.290
so much power.
You,

10
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.910
you can't really use it on those canyons because it's just so by the time you

11
00:00:34.911 --> 00:00:37.180
hit the gas,
you're hitting the breaks.
Like you hit the gas you get,

12
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.610
it's like something around 800 horsepower around there.
Yep.

13
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.270
Give or take depending.
Well gas he used and like 3,200 pounds,

14
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.630
31 3,100 pounds.
That's fucking ridiculous.

15
00:00:47.631 --> 00:00:52.140
It's like a factory sort of gt three weight with 800 horsepower,
you know,

16
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.690
go up to talk about,
you know,

17
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.590
six 50 to the wheels and until you're bouncing off the revolution,
uh,
you know,

18
00:00:57.591 --> 00:00:58.610
second,
third gear,

19
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.630
second gear on the limited who's 87 miles an hour.

20
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.020
Third was a buck 25 and then by the time he deep in a fourth,

21
00:01:07.021 --> 00:01:09.560
he just sorta running out a road.
And if you,

22
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.230
have you done a top speed on that car yet you attempted it?
Yes.
Well,

23
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.020
officially we saw a one 47 somewhere yesterday and we were not out of fourth

24
00:01:18.021 --> 00:01:22.490
gear,
so it's probably gotta be close to 200 well over 200.
Actually.

25
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.020
The way that kit works,
um,
it's already just in a turbo car.

26
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.000
It already does about 202 in the mile.
So in a lighter two wheel drive car,

27
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.200
it's about that.
I mean,
it'll trap one 40 in the quarter.
Easy.
It's like a,

28
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.920
it does everything.
You know,
who know,

29
00:01:37.921 --> 00:01:41.510
there's always this thing about cars where people always want to add more power.

30
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.730
And as you guys both know,

31
00:01:43.731 --> 00:01:48.560
we're in this weird horsepower war now in the world where every year cars have

32
00:01:48.561 --> 00:01:51.740
to,
if you have a car that makes 400 horsepower next year,

33
00:01:51.741 --> 00:01:55.400
it's got to at least make a little more 400 horsepowers like a Camry right now.

34
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.530
Right.
Well how about that BMW m three that I have,

35
00:01:57.531 --> 00:02:00.560
which is a pretty moderate car,
420 horsepower.

36
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.280
Let me tell you the craziest thing that I did recently.
Last year in July,

37
00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:06.440
I went to Norway to the gap bowl festival.

38
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.690
I don't know if you've heard of these things,
know how to describe it.

39
00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:13.691
It was like Mad Max meets burning man on steroids and it's essentially a DIY

40
00:02:14.151 --> 00:02:16.400
drift fest,
but essentially these guys,

41
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.610
800 to a thousand horsepower and a Volvo wagon and they're drifting sideways

42
00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:23.120
around the whole track.
So yeah,

43
00:02:23.121 --> 00:02:26.960
the days of 400 horsepower sorta been a benchmark,
a Gumbo.

44
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.110
I'm sort of the opposite.
I'm the lessees Morga you know?
Yeah.

45
00:02:30.111 --> 00:02:30.944
Well that's what I wanted.

46
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.780
I thought it was interesting that you take these really cool old classic nine

47
00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:39.080
11th,
and if you haven't seen the documentary urban outlaw,

48
00:02:39.081 --> 00:02:41.600
you gotta check it out.
It's just so,
what is it about 30 plus minute,

49
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.430
two minutes short documents in a May?

50
00:02:43.431 --> 00:02:46.790
It really got me excited about those old cars.

51
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.380
It's an amazing documentary.
And you don't,
one of the things that you said,
we,

52
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.160
we down already
with the audio.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We'll,
we'll work it out.

53
00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.350
Um,
we,
we have a new setup here.
This is completely new to

54
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.230
<v 2>being at NASA or over here.
Well,
that's all.</v>

55
00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:05.530
This is a new thing called a tri caster and it does everything in HD,

56
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.100
but we haven't worked out all the kinks yet.
Is it?
It's on recording.

57
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.500
You mean we're not shooting this on an iPhone?

58
00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:15.180
I'm sure we'll hear about it on reddit and everyone the audio back up.

59
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.080
But as the audio up,
let me hear.
Hold on.
Yeah,
it's work.

60
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.190
There you go.
You know why often the corner has got an iPhone.

61
00:03:23.191 --> 00:03:28.150
You can take some great shots with that bag.
Ralph,
Ralph's ready to rock your,
uh,

62
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.870
your documentary about those old classic nine 11,

63
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.040
and you know,
you rebuild them and add your own touches to them,
but,

64
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.480
but your car is,
you know,
you're,

65
00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:40.150
you're working with some of them less than 200 doors.
Yeah,
I mean,

66
00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:42.150
most of my calls a small displaced,
you know,

67
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.110
for those that don't know my collections,
basically early nine 11,

68
00:03:45.111 --> 00:03:47.740
it's from 64 through [inaudible] 73,
you know,

69
00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:52.530
I'm not really just covers to lead up to two full unlike this mad dog in English

70
00:03:52.531 --> 00:03:55.360
men right here,
Alex.
Well,
you know,
too much.
He's never enough.

71
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.700
My background was sort of the opposite,
you know,

72
00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.530
it was more of the sort of giant killer.

73
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:03.090
Trying to chase down the cars with twice as much power,
uh,

74
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.340
was to me a bit more exciting rather than just sort of,
you know,

75
00:04:06.341 --> 00:04:10.090
Florida and a straight line and you can still get a lot done if a costs set up

76
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:10.751
pretty well.

77
00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:15.751
Cause two 77 that's a car I've tracked on an off for 12 years and a lot of uh,

78
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.040
club racing stuff and he's so dialed in that 220 horsepower is pretty usable in

79
00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:25.490
a car that only ways they say 20 to 50 wait is such a key to what I call a flat

80
00:04:25.491 --> 00:04:28.960
foot Chi.
You can keep your foot planted all the time,
unlike the gt two,

81
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:29.920
as great as that is,

82
00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:33.490
you got to roll into that amount of power because if he just stump it,

83
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.340
you just spin in the road.
It's almost too much power.
I mean he'd stop.

84
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.000
I think the challenge is there,

85
00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:44.710
he's trying to build to modulate and actually get that power down is takes a

86
00:04:44.711 --> 00:04:48.280
little bit of finesse cause she sort of got a role into it cause traction

87
00:04:48.281 --> 00:04:51.490
control on or off.
If you stamp it,
he sorted as the same thing.

88
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.300
He just chirping and spinning and stepping sideways.
Well,

89
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.151
correct me if I'm wrong,

90
00:04:55.151 --> 00:04:59.770
but the traction control did they calculated based on the horsepower of the

91
00:04:59.771 --> 00:05:02.560
engine actually has.
So when you jam it up to,

92
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.960
<v 3>it's not just traction,
it's a stability management.</v>

93
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.490
It was the first time on a 907 that it had well on a gt car.

94
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.990
So your car being an you know,
oh seven oh eight mark one,

95
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.750
it actually has like a,
uh,
a more simple traction control system that,
you know,

96
00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:20.430
you can,
you can turn off.
Um,

97
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.010
but it doesn't have stability management like the gt two.

98
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.460
So it actually has two buttons.
One is,
you know,
are you fucking nuts?

99
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.580
You're going to fucking die in right now.
So,
yeah.

100
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.520
So is that on the button or it just,
his passed on was,

101
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.520
it says like s c plus TC equals death,
right?

102
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:37.770
<v 2>Like no</v>

103
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.070
<v 3>orange light comes on,
you know?
Yeah.
You,
you know,
it's sort of like,</v>

104
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.910
it gives you a chime as if you've got a problem with your engine.
You know,

105
00:05:46.911 --> 00:05:49.580
that same like if you have a check engine light on a car,
you know,

106
00:05:49.581 --> 00:05:51.680
you just got this thing and you like,
you know,

107
00:05:51.681 --> 00:05:56.150
you're driving and you have this like,
you know,
orange amber warning sign.

108
00:05:56.151 --> 00:05:58.040
So it's,
it's you,
they're pretty to

109
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.870
<v 4>the old cars have none of that crap,
you know,
you do.</v>

110
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:03.320
So that feeling or you don't feel it,
I just,
especially with the brakes,
right.

111
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.650
You,
you actually can modularly,
yeah.
Pushing them hard.
Yeah.

112
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:08.260
No power assisted small.

113
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.350
What's happened to the brakes on the gt two are almost the same size as the

114
00:06:12.351 --> 00:06:16.570
wheels on two 77,
14 and a half,
15 inch,
80 million.

115
00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.950
So yeah,
they're almost the same size.
They're 15 inch brakes,
15 inch wheels,

116
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.340
and those are 15 x breaks.
Well,
you need it with that car.

117
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.520
And most people aren't aware of how much computer generated stuff is going on

118
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:34.490
behind the scenes of a lot of these modern high powered horse cars.

119
00:06:34.491 --> 00:06:37.760
Like I got to drive the challenger Hellcat recently and all that stuff.

120
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.250
Even though it's 770 horsepower,

121
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.510
it's very manageable when you're driving it around because they have all this

122
00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:48.100
stuff going on behind the scenes.
There's always a pug.
I still got my,
uh,

123
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.730
69 superbeets that,
well,
there's a,
that's a mopar to be proud of.

124
00:06:52.731 --> 00:06:56.510
This folly
is the valet key,

125
00:06:56.511 --> 00:06:59.600
like special for the fire.
Yeah,
they give you that.

126
00:06:59.601 --> 00:07:03.030
But I told them I don't even want that
stupid.

127
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:07.030
Why should they have 500 got caught.
You caught it.

128
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.860
But if you leave a valley guy with a 500 horsepower car,

129
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.420
he could kill himself a wrapping around and shake just as easily 700 horsepower

130
00:07:14.421 --> 00:07:17.240
car.
It's pretty funny for folks who don't know what we're talking about.

131
00:07:17.241 --> 00:07:19.830
There's two different keys.
One is a red key and one's a black key.

132
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.760
The red key gives you full access to all the power,

133
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.470
which gets you up to hell cat,
707 horsepower somehow or another.

134
00:07:27.471 --> 00:07:31.310
Just having the black key limits,
the amount of horsepower.
Yeah,

135
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.630
well it just doesn't end probably controls it controls,
you know,

136
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:39.220
throttle mapping and not as much black metal.
You know,
an amount of uh,

137
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.290
yeah,
it's probably just a throttle map controller and you know,

138
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:46.730
obviously you know,
it doesn't allow you to sort of dig deeper and go higher up.

139
00:07:46.731 --> 00:07:49.310
He said,
well there's a big,
there's a lot of rev limitations.

140
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.630
Even when you just wrapped the car up just to have some fun with it feels
sloppy.

141
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:57.410
Well it just backs off when you get up near anywhere near the red line like you,

142
00:07:57.411 --> 00:07:58.820
you,
you,
you feel it cutting out.

143
00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:01.500
I think in the moral to the story is never let a valet guy knew you car.

144
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.830
Really that is the moral is good.

145
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:06.050
We don't need two keys and I've never let any valet touching my GED.

146
00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:08.630
I had it valet key with one of the first cars I had,

147
00:08:08.631 --> 00:08:13.490
which was you know like in at the end of 19 nine it was a supercharged Jaguar

148
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:18.490
XKR and it was a convertible best of British two vertebral total California car.

149
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.220
That when you were doing all that modeling and you were telling me about that

150
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.740
was that was a lot longer supermodel.
Yeah.

151
00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.010
Early Internet celebrity.
Did you know that about him?

152
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:32.240
A gamer you,
I don't know.
Do you remember?

153
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:36.070
Do you remember websites like Tom's hardware and non tech?

154
00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.800
Sharkey extreme was mine and that was one of the big three.

155
00:08:39.801 --> 00:08:43.010
And then food or extreme was another one that started,
did I remember that?

156
00:08:43.011 --> 00:08:44.090
I remember since the men,

157
00:08:44.091 --> 00:08:47.180
and I remember I started reading the map behind the shocked about this before.

158
00:08:47.181 --> 00:08:48.920
I don't know if we talked about it on the podcast.

159
00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:51.140
We've definitely talked about it before.
That was your background.

160
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:54.290
I was a student video gamer.
I was trying to make some money.

161
00:08:54.291 --> 00:08:56.060
So I started writing for

162
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:59.790
<v 3>magazines and this is back in England and uh,
they would go,</v>

163
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.680
why you want to write about,
you know,

164
00:09:01.681 --> 00:09:04.560
hardware in three d cards and all this shit's never going to work.

165
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.550
And so I just started posting it on the Internet instead and I moved out here

166
00:09:08.551 --> 00:09:11.970
and you know,
sold a website that was big during the Dotcom era.

167
00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:13.250
<v 2>He's a funny little bit thought it.</v>

168
00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:16.070
That's one of those things where people thought there was no market for it.

169
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.160
People thought,
Nah,
no one's going to pay attention to that APP.

170
00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:20.380
But you could put it on the Internet and you put it on the Internet.

171
00:09:20.381 --> 00:09:22.300
It becomes giant.
Well,
obviously there's a market,

172
00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:25.150
just you fuck heads couldn't figure out how to reach that market.

173
00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:29.530
Remember this crazy thing in 1999 y two k like it's going to melt down.

174
00:09:29.531 --> 00:09:32.090
I mean it's amazing.
I didn't fucking meltdown.

175
00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:36.570
How about again in 2012 everybody thought
they were right.

176
00:09:36.571 --> 00:09:40.570
The stars are going to lie,
it's going to last or is up there.
Yeah,

177
00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:42.933
those are fake though.

178
00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.510
<v 3>Photographs.
But you know,
you grow up in England and you,
you know,</v>

179
00:09:47.511 --> 00:09:51.410
cause well there's this big divide basically between north,
south,
north,

180
00:09:51.411 --> 00:09:55.850
south divide.
So you've probably seen those snatch and lock stock and

181
00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.660
<v 2>ferries.
Northern monkeys,</v>

182
00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:02.480
Ella or it's like American being in the eight one eight two,
one three,
two.

183
00:10:02.481 --> 00:10:04.990
One is the south.
And then as the norm

184
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.860
<v 3>grew up in the Ritzy,
cool park,
which is a south,</v>

185
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:12.960
I was grim northern Steeltown chef.
Right.
But even in the south,

186
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:17.640
you know,
if you said,
um,
you know,
to your school counselor or career person,

187
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:21.780
you know,
I want to be a fucking astronauts.
There'd be like tone it down a bit,

188
00:10:21.781 --> 00:10:25.980
you know,
or I want to be a baker now.
You can't do that son,
you know,
just,
just,

189
00:10:25.981 --> 00:10:27.300
uh,
get a normal job.

190
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:32.300
<v 2>Yeah.
Talking about America,
I used to hear cut your hair and get a real job.</v>

191
00:10:32.301 --> 00:10:36.860
I was into heavy metal.
I've had long hair since I was 14,
15.
And you know,

192
00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:40.130
over 30 odd years later,
I still got long hair.
But you got more than long hair,

193
00:10:40.131 --> 00:10:42.060
man.
You've got a whole ecosystem.
And I,
you know,

194
00:10:42.061 --> 00:10:45.440
had you got some crazy extra long like rope,

195
00:10:45.441 --> 00:10:50.180
like things I hang out of the car though,
that's epic getting caught in the door.

196
00:10:50.181 --> 00:10:51.014
I was telling these guys,

197
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.450
one of my funniest moments was at the Frankfurt auto show.

198
00:10:53.451 --> 00:10:57.080
Him Push her debut at the nine 18 last year and it was literally 10 minutes

199
00:10:57.081 --> 00:10:58.860
after debuted all the press was uh,

200
00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.640
and the invite me up on stage and you get in this nine 18,

201
00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.490
and I get my hair caught in the door next day.

202
00:11:04.491 --> 00:11:07.580
There's like headlines in the newspaper.
So subtitle,

203
00:11:07.581 --> 00:11:11.870
he read something like English born American rock star gets her hair caught in

204
00:11:11.871 --> 00:11:13.760
nine 18 door at Frankfurt auto show.

205
00:11:13.761 --> 00:11:16.520
But for me it's sort of like the Samsung thing where you know,

206
00:11:16.521 --> 00:11:18.800
I'm afraid to cut my hair because I'll lose my strength.

207
00:11:18.801 --> 00:11:22.160
But now it's just turning gray and getting thinner and fallen out.

208
00:11:22.161 --> 00:11:25.780
But I've had a long career for 30 years.
But if I was bald on top of,

209
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:28.750
you're going to keep it on the side.
It'll be like a Nashville posts.

210
00:11:28.751 --> 00:11:29.720
Have you ever seen that band?

211
00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:32.790
You know where the guy takes his hat off and he's like completely bald on the

212
00:11:32.791 --> 00:11:34.460
top and it'll be like that.

213
00:11:34.461 --> 00:11:38.960
But I think the point I was making is England is a sort of class divided
country.

214
00:11:38.961 --> 00:11:41.250
Whereas coming to America,
for me at 19

215
00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.290
<v 3>you could sorta be whatever class divided even in the south.</v>

216
00:11:45.291 --> 00:11:47.960
I mean when you come from England,
I mean let's face it,

217
00:11:47.961 --> 00:11:51.770
we don't have much of a space program.
We don't have,
I mean,
you know,

218
00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.290
no career person is going to teach

219
00:11:55.940 --> 00:12:00.610
<v 1>you guys do
with you.
You son of a bitch.
You carry those things everywhere.</v>

220
00:12:00.611 --> 00:12:04.620
Everywhere,
everywhere.
Dude,
man,
they don't think that Dick's,

221
00:12:04.621 --> 00:12:07.830
but they did the shorts.
Well,
I have a good friend from Steve.
Uh,

222
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.300
his name is Steve and he's from England as well.
And he must know,

223
00:12:10.301 --> 00:12:11.320
he tells me the same thing.

224
00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:16.420
He's actually a professor Steve.
Yeah,
Buddy John.

225
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:20.950
He's a professor at Stanford and um,
he says essentially the same thing.

226
00:12:20.951 --> 00:12:23.680
He says that when you are in England,

227
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:27.670
they sort of limit what your aspirations should be.
They tell you where to go.

228
00:12:27.671 --> 00:12:28.630
They tell you what to do.

229
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.740
<v 3>I mean,
I literally went up to the biggest magazines and um,</v>

230
00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:38.370
you know,
Ralph in the background.
Yeah.
But it's distracting the image.

231
00:12:38.371 --> 00:12:39.204
It's distracting.

232
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:44.110
<v 1>Yeah.
We're not his kneecaps caps.
I mean,
if you could sit,
you can sit over here,</v>

233
00:12:44.111 --> 00:12:46.060
you could do whatever you want.
You can join in if you like.

234
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.770
Should we get him some long pants?
He kept saying the background.

235
00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:53.350
We'd do it in the background when the image.
Um,
but just so you know,

236
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:57.780
<v 3>he,
he used to work for a very famous Porsche race team.</v>

237
00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:00.020
He used to godfather the Godfather.

238
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:03.680
He used to work for foster check Polak and he was parking like rs [inaudible]

239
00:13:03.681 --> 00:13:06.460
and moving all these multimillion dollar cars.
That

240
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:13.120
<v 1>colors of your 3.9 years.
Yeah,
he is like right off to Kermit.
That's right.</v>

241
00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:14.530
And uh,
and he's also,

242
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:17.560
he's also barefoot and he drives barefoot cause he can heal.

243
00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:22.030
Untie the gas station in downtown actually.
Yeah.
You want to sit in here?
No,

244
00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.470
you're good.
Okay.
We know he's cool.
He's very cool.
He's,

245
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.750
he's the lessees mall guy.
My friend Steve Hilton,

246
00:13:28.751 --> 00:13:33.280
who he's a professor at Stanford is a very interesting guy.
Fascinating guy.

247
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:35.140
And He fucking loves America.

248
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:40.530
And he said he didn't realize how negative and how limiting the attitudes of

249
00:13:40.571 --> 00:13:43.960
people in England are until he got to America.
When America people like,
yeah,

250
00:13:43.961 --> 00:13:46.060
you could do whatever you want to do,
whatever you want to do.

251
00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:48.760
<v 3>No,
literally,
I think I told you this on the last one,</v>

252
00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:51.820
but I went to the most academic ritzy school.

253
00:13:51.821 --> 00:13:54.820
I don't know how the hell I got in there.
A lot of hard work and you know,

254
00:13:54.821 --> 00:13:58.360
my mom started good.
Looks stunning.
Yeah.
Um,

255
00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:03.220
and when I did get there,
I mean,
the whole time it's sort of,

256
00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:07.030
you know,
no,
just keep it down son.
Keep it down.
You know,
don't,

257
00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.880
don't just try and do something different.
This is what you need to do.

258
00:14:09.881 --> 00:14:12.460
You need to do this,
this,
this,
and this,
and then you'll,

259
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:15.820
you'll get a job in the city.
There's no such thing as dare to be different.

260
00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:19.910
Then I left school at 15.
I don't want you left school,
but I don't even know

261
00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:23.530
<v 1>I was the momentum of ancient times.
It's</v>

262
00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:28.510
<v 3>just,
it's just them and you know,
you don't want to make him go down this path.</v>

263
00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:32.290
Imagine going to the biggest,
you know,
gaming magazines,
well,
whatever.

264
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.430
If you're a nerd,
um,

265
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:37.450
gaming magazines and PC magazines back in the 90s and saying,
hey,

266
00:14:37.451 --> 00:14:40.960
there's this really cool new technology that I'm playing with and it's sort of

267
00:14:40.961 --> 00:14:45.850
early on.
I know,
but it's going to make all these video games better.
And then,

268
00:14:45.851 --> 00:14:48.240
you know,
the editor in chief,
you know,
he's been there since,
you know,

269
00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:52.010
1985 just goes,
Nah,
that's not going to work.
I'm not doing that.

270
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.970
<v 2>And so you've got nowhere to like express,
you know,
something cool and new.</v>

271
00:14:55.971 --> 00:14:59.000
So yeah,
the Internet was pretty fricking amazing for me.
You know,

272
00:14:59.001 --> 00:15:03.130
I just threw it up there and then people start reading it and you know,

273
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:05.450
then what's funny is that same,
that same company,

274
00:15:05.451 --> 00:15:09.320
the publishing company tried to buy my website like fucking four years later and

275
00:15:09.321 --> 00:15:10.154
I said no,

276
00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:14.950
I sold it to internet.com or see something similar in America where the Midwest,

277
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.650
and there's a lot of parts of this country that don't have urban centers and

278
00:15:18.651 --> 00:15:19.484
don't have,

279
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:23.660
there's a lot of people that are there that have like really limited ideas of

280
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.720
how people should act,
how people should dress,
what people should do,

281
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:28.430
what religions you should follow.

282
00:15:28.431 --> 00:15:33.431
And because of the Internet w there's like this embedding of like a new culture

283
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.700
in all of these areas.
Like you'd go to anywhere,
you can go to the Midwest,

284
00:15:37.701 --> 00:15:40.820
he can go to Kansas,
you can go and you'll find really fucking cool.

285
00:15:40.821 --> 00:15:43.420
Kids who are on the ball will understand what's going on.

286
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:47.420
We used to have to go to a library to find anything out or to exist anymore.

287
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:52.190
Yeah,
they do.
I take my kids to know what did do you do with them there?

288
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:55.590
They look at a little kid books,
man,
like dinosaur books.

289
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:58.490
Those on the web because we were talking about magazines and where do you get

290
00:15:58.491 --> 00:16:01.410
them?
It's like the Arab was still,
she's sort of hard to find them.
Yeah.

291
00:16:01.411 --> 00:16:04.490
We're talking about buy magazines at the airport it seems he's got a lot of
them.

292
00:16:04.491 --> 00:16:07.210
Yeah.
A lot of bookstores are dying out and then everything,

293
00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:11.900
all the Porsche magazines and stuff,
they're all like,
you know,
on the iPad now.

294
00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.540
You know,
my mom's like better on the IPAD.
Yeah,

295
00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:18.470
he's got an iPhone and snapping photos.
I mean I've sort of,
because I'm an ex,

296
00:16:18.471 --> 00:16:21.940
you know magazine guy too.
I just,
there's something about reading it on paper.

297
00:16:21.941 --> 00:16:25.300
I still,
you know,
I still want to cut down trees,
I guess to do it,
but you know,

298
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:28.130
I got a great photo of him.
The tree hug,
a photo outside in the rain.

299
00:16:28.131 --> 00:16:31.040
You're not Doug's in English man.
Hugging the trees,
humping your tree.
Sorry,

300
00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:35.960
it's just controlling side.
I just rent here.
Just wipe it clean.

301
00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:41.300
But it is amazing that the Internet offers up all these opportunities and the

302
00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:43.580
Internet is essentially how I found out about both of you guys.

303
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:47.480
I found out about you because of the urban outlaw documentary,
which is,
look,

304
00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:50.910
how else would you have ever watched that documentary if it wasn't like that

305
00:16:50.911 --> 00:16:54.170
came out of left field?
I mean,
if I can talk about that for a minute too.
I mean,

306
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:59.090
uh,
I got to give props to,
to me and Moscow vici my Canadian bid.
Oh Buddy.
Who to,

307
00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:03.770
he'd been fallen my post on Pelican Paltz and I was starting to get a little bit

308
00:17:03.771 --> 00:17:06.830
of magazine coverage probably three years ago.

309
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:11.480
And pelican parts for folks who don't know the website or the sort of classic

310
00:17:11.481 --> 00:17:16.481
pull should go to a online forum and Paul supply place and many Anna,

311
00:17:16.991 --> 00:17:20.240
right?
A thread going,
the cold Porsche collection out of control hobby.

312
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:24.860
And Tamir was a Canadian film director who was sort of dissatisfied with doing

313
00:17:24.861 --> 00:17:26.960
bud light commercials.
More importantly,

314
00:17:26.961 --> 00:17:31.310
he was a poor Sharona and sort of connected with my story and figured maybe

315
00:17:31.311 --> 00:17:34.850
there's a little bit more to it than it'd been told through my posts.
And uh,

316
00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:39.410
talking to the internet shot me an email and a couple of emails later we had a

317
00:17:39.411 --> 00:17:44.000
sort of a online verbal handshake and he flew down on his frequent flyer miles

318
00:17:44.001 --> 00:17:47.630
to la,
hired a sort of very talented crew for nothing.

319
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:50.670
And from my point of it was like,
what's the worst that can happen here?

320
00:17:50.671 --> 00:17:53.400
I'm going to drive around for four days and get some great footage.

321
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:57.360
We didn't know what was going to happen with that film,
you know.
And uh,

322
00:17:57.361 --> 00:18:00.040
we released a trailer,
probably we shot,

323
00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:02.460
we shot it in 2012 January,

324
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:06.810
released a trailer a couple of months later that got picked up by top gear and

325
00:18:06.811 --> 00:18:08.880
that things sort of went viral and exploded.

326
00:18:08.881 --> 00:18:13.881
And then the film came out October 15th Online and got into the raindance film

327
00:18:14.041 --> 00:18:17.040
festival and just sort of went from there.
You know?

328
00:18:17.041 --> 00:18:20.280
And it's amazing how global that thing became.

329
00:18:20.281 --> 00:18:22.800
Cause I think people connected to the story,
you know,

330
00:18:22.801 --> 00:18:25.230
the film urban outlaw is not purely about Porsche.

331
00:18:25.231 --> 00:18:29.010
It's about my story of following my dream,
which everyone can relate to.

332
00:18:29.011 --> 00:18:32.670
And we touched on a little bit growing up in England and then coming to America

333
00:18:32.671 --> 00:18:33.810
was in 19 year old,

334
00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:38.370
not knowing anybody but just sorta following your passion and my theory is

335
00:18:38.371 --> 00:18:39.840
always the same.
How bad can it be?

336
00:18:39.841 --> 00:18:41.760
And that's ultimately the great thing about America.

337
00:18:41.761 --> 00:18:44.010
And I think that's what to me are captured in the film.

338
00:18:44.011 --> 00:18:48.710
Urban outlaw was my sort of spirit,
which is a common spirit of trying to,

339
00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:48.990
you know,

340
00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:52.830
follow your dreams and do what it is you like to do without taking no for an

341
00:18:52.831 --> 00:18:56.670
answer.
In the past two years since that film came out,
you know,

342
00:18:56.671 --> 00:18:59.640
it's just been a whirlwind of travel for me and meeting great people.

343
00:18:59.641 --> 00:19:02.820
And I've realized the sort of common bond with all car guys,

344
00:19:02.821 --> 00:19:06.850
it doesn't matter whether you're driving a 800 horsepower gt two or beaten a

345
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:10.320
building,
a VWD back a yard or you're a mopar guy.

346
00:19:10.321 --> 00:19:14.430
We all share that same common bond of loving to tinker with cars,

347
00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:19.140
like getting out and driving and basically trying to express yourself through

348
00:19:19.141 --> 00:19:22.980
the styling of the car and the passion of the car and everything that it
evolves.

349
00:19:22.981 --> 00:19:25.620
And it is a language,
you know I say Porsche is a language,

350
00:19:25.621 --> 00:19:29.160
but I think all car guys share that same common bond.

351
00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.670
And I think that's the connection why people sort of related to the film.

352
00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:36.920
<v 5>Well your,
your passion and your enthusiasm is really addictive.</v>

353
00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.030
And that's one of the things I love about people were in the,

354
00:19:39.031 --> 00:19:43.130
I watched a documentary recently,
short piece on a guy who makes knives.

355
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:46.160
He makes like three nights.
No,

356
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:49.800
I mean he makes mostly like knives for chefs and house us.

357
00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:53.300
But he does them all by hand.
The hammers,
the steel,
the whole deal.

358
00:19:53.301 --> 00:19:56.630
And you're watching him coach and what pieces and Polish them down.

359
00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:59.950
<v 2>Well garlic.
So in knife story Clapton and these things are like,
you know,</v>

360
00:19:59.951 --> 00:20:02.770
25 50 grand knives,
some of these old like,
you know

361
00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:06.900
<v 5>real to me tich collected,
well this isn't vintage,
this is all handmade stuff,</v>

362
00:20:06.901 --> 00:20:07.734
but it's just too,

363
00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:12.030
my used to have a regular job and then I think his company is called Brooklyn

364
00:20:12.031 --> 00:20:15.480
cut and um,
he's goes,
started like,
you know,

365
00:20:15.481 --> 00:20:19.020
it was like in a funk and he started making knives almost as a hobby and then it

366
00:20:19.021 --> 00:20:23.340
became as is his job.
But as he's making these knives,
it's like you're,

367
00:20:23.341 --> 00:20:27.510
you're really interested in the craftsmanship and his passion and enthusiasm.

368
00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.180
That's so addictive.
I don't have any desire to make knives.
Yeah.

369
00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:33.420
If I could kick a knife,
I cut it tomato and the knives done,
done.
I'm done.

370
00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:36.270
Pretty fucking cool to see someone that's just,
you know,

371
00:20:36.271 --> 00:20:39.050
he's obviously that's his passion and,

372
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:42.420
and he's putting everything into it and I think process

373
00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:45.660
<v 2>goes further than street smart than book smart.</v>

374
00:20:45.661 --> 00:20:49.540
So I often describe myself as a street smart guy cause I left school early

375
00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:50.830
without a lot of education.

376
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.700
You were talking earlier on about and the path people go down where the in

377
00:20:54.701 --> 00:20:56.470
school,
University College,

378
00:20:56.471 --> 00:21:00.550
you know you come out when the 2123 and they've got no idea what they want to
do,

379
00:21:00.551 --> 00:21:02.490
what they've got all these degrees in education and,

380
00:21:02.491 --> 00:21:05.110
and then sometimes they just sort of float around.

381
00:21:05.111 --> 00:21:09.400
For me it was a complete opposite but just always trying to enjoy life and find

382
00:21:09.401 --> 00:21:12.670
things that you enjoy doing but the kids never give up.
You know,

383
00:21:12.671 --> 00:21:16.330
it's like that guy with the knives,
you know,
turns seems to be a hobby.

384
00:21:16.331 --> 00:21:19.570
Passion into a what sounds like a pretty successful business.

385
00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:24.380
<v 3>Came over here in 98 I didn't even have a driver's license so that's hilarious.</v>

386
00:21:24.381 --> 00:21:26.690
When you consider what you do now I want to see him drive.

387
00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.840
He drives a little quicker.
Not that good though.
Yeah,
it's good.

388
00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:37.310
Not as good as him.
He's actually,
you know,
it's funny you mentioned,

389
00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:41.810
you know most of your collection is a,
you know,
the early cars and low powered,

390
00:21:41.811 --> 00:21:46.390
but you know,
I left the car with him.
It rained in la,
remember like a while ago.

391
00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.020
For like a week thanksgiving.

392
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:52.400
And you know my wife actually who made that video that you saw because she,
yeah.

393
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:56.470
Which is not as good as he as actually the one with Kermit,
you know.

394
00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:59.750
And it's not one of those home videos you guys like yeah we like to do those but

395
00:21:59.751 --> 00:22:03.410
that's a different one.
Then he goes a private in oil or something?
No,
not in oil.

396
00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:06.910
Just in water.
You a water cooled gun.
That's right.

397
00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:10.970
I said I've got to get it in there.
But yeah,
I mean you know,

398
00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.240
we left it that well.
I said I've got to get back on a flight.

399
00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.480
I need back story before that.
Yeah,
we'll tell them the back story.

400
00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:20.180
But the point where you're trying to get at is it,

401
00:22:20.181 --> 00:22:22.940
you left the car with him to try to get them addicted.
Exactly.

402
00:22:22.941 --> 00:22:25.490
And this is like the hazard.
Go for the back story though.

403
00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:27.320
This is the third or the fourth time.

404
00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:32.510
And just watching him sort of go up in his,
in his roads,
not in,

405
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:37.520
you know,
a two,
seven,
seven or an early car.
And,
you know,
he respects the power,

406
00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:40.070
but it just eases it.
And,
and like I said,
it was like a,

407
00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:44.420
like you found a song on the radio that he liked,
if anyone listens to radio,

408
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:46.730
but you know,
and he's like,
I think I liked that.

409
00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:49.550
And it turns up the volume a little more than it goes back and,
you know,

410
00:22:49.551 --> 00:22:53.150
chops to mark tomatoes with those knives probably.
And then it goes back.

411
00:22:53.151 --> 00:22:55.670
I like that song a lot actually,
and I'm going to turn it up a little more.

412
00:22:55.671 --> 00:22:59.720
And he continues to cook and by the end of like,
that drive was a two hour drive.

413
00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.580
You turned around to 11.
Yeah.
You know,

414
00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:06.440
instead of having like 30% throttle or a three out of 10 on the volume knob,

415
00:23:06.441 --> 00:23:10.070
you know,
was more at seven or eight.
And he's like,
yeah,
this is,
this is,

416
00:23:10.071 --> 00:23:13.820
this is uh,
this,
this needs some uh,
time.
You know,
and uh,
yeah.

417
00:23:13.821 --> 00:23:14.750
So I left it with them for a month.

418
00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:19.860
<v 2>They something that you also have to get accustomed to when you're coming from</v>

419
00:23:19.861 --> 00:23:23.670
these cars that are essentially your cars are somewhere around 200 horsepower

420
00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:26.700
and then all of a sudden you're driving that things almost got four times the

421
00:23:26.701 --> 00:23:27.421
amount of power.

422
00:23:27.421 --> 00:23:31.980
So I'm used to sort of getting in these two 77 type calls and you just keep your

423
00:23:31.981 --> 00:23:35.790
foot planted all the time.
I call him flat foot cause where pedal to the metal,

424
00:23:35.791 --> 00:23:39.680
sort of my slogan gt two with almost 800 horsepower.
He,

425
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:44.700
you can't do that.
So pedal to the carpet,
gradual pedal to the metal,
you know,

426
00:23:44.701 --> 00:23:45.110
to me.

427
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:48.650
So it's a lot about variety and the challenge with that car is trying to get

428
00:23:48.651 --> 00:23:50.990
comfortable with it where you feel confident,

429
00:23:50.991 --> 00:23:53.780
where you can push it more and more and you know,
break later,

430
00:23:53.781 --> 00:23:55.400
get on the gas earlier type of thing.

431
00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:59.090
And it's a challenge to build a modular and try and get the most out of that
car.

432
00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:02.990
The flip side to it is,
you know,
driving around town under 4,000 Rpm,

433
00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:07.040
it's pretty dosel just like any other car,
he gets real angry real quick.

434
00:24:07.041 --> 00:24:09.140
But again,
it's,
it's the whole passion thing.
You know,

435
00:24:09.141 --> 00:24:11.870
I'm addicted to his passion basically,
you know,
the,

436
00:24:11.871 --> 00:24:13.790
from the first time I met him,
you know,

437
00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:17.270
like really it was about a year ago with the blue car to the point where,

438
00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:21.830
you know,
I'm crazy enough,
I guess some people think to just go,
hey man,

439
00:24:21.831 --> 00:24:23.690
can I leave the car with you for a month?
You know,

440
00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:26.690
some guidance got a video like that,
you know,
often the canyons.

441
00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:31.910
Now you're leaving a car where it's all of one and w a modified one of one,

442
00:24:31.911 --> 00:24:36.560
but essentially one of 200 ever built.
But I couldn't think of anything better.

443
00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:39.620
Like I'm not going to bring,
uh,
you know,
I'm not going to bring a dolled up.

444
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:43.790
You see for me to clarify,
I've owned a lot of early nine eleven's a lot of them,

445
00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:47.810
but uh,
my collections,
my own collection,
I don't build customer cars.

446
00:24:47.811 --> 00:24:48.830
And I think there's a bit of this,

447
00:24:48.831 --> 00:24:52.850
a miss sort of a interpretation that people think I'm a tuning sharp or a

448
00:24:52.851 --> 00:24:53.810
performance shop,

449
00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:58.040
building customer cars to get these emails all the time from guys wanting me to

450
00:24:58.041 --> 00:25:00.860
build cars for them or can they drop their car off.

451
00:25:00.861 --> 00:25:05.420
And I've had quite a few people approached me wanting to do collaborations with

452
00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:08.690
other tuners.
So you know,
just to clarify,

453
00:25:08.691 --> 00:25:12.500
I'm a collector and I like to get out and drive out on build customer cause I've

454
00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.360
helped my buddies out occasionally.

455
00:25:14.361 --> 00:25:18.740
So when Alex approached me with the car and just sort of left it and he gave me

456
00:25:18.741 --> 00:25:21.650
the classic line,
like what I think is going to become the old time,

457
00:25:21.651 --> 00:25:22.850
classic line for me,
he goes,

458
00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:26.530
just treat it as if it was your own car and do whatever you want to do with he

459
00:25:26.531 --> 00:25:30.430
painted it.
Yeah.
I'm,

460
00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:33.680
I'm done with what I call opp other people's Porsches.
You know,

461
00:25:33.681 --> 00:25:38.300
for me this was just a real fun collaborations bell to put my sort of artistic

462
00:25:38.301 --> 00:25:43.301
stylistic interpretation of the Sixties and seventies sport purpose era onto a

463
00:25:44.271 --> 00:25:47.630
new car,
which is something that hasn't really been done.
You know,

464
00:25:47.631 --> 00:25:52.631
no one's really took that 60 70 styling and put it on a new car and the Porsche

465
00:25:52.701 --> 00:25:56.810
welds a little bit black and white in a sense just to sorta be real broad is

466
00:25:57.230 --> 00:26:00.480
rather an air cooled guy or you're a water cooled guy,
you know,

467
00:26:00.481 --> 00:26:01.370
and a generic term.

468
00:26:01.371 --> 00:26:04.800
The two don't necessarily mix even though they really do all the folks in onto

469
00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.560
what we're talking about.
Just explain the era.

470
00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:10.370
She's not a Porsche Forum we're on right here.
This is just a regular podcast,

471
00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:15.790
but it's essentially it was [inaudible] 94 was when nine nine three ended

472
00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:21.350
production.
It was 98 that was lost.
And when that happened,
when that happened,

473
00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:26.090
oh you know,
Porsche guys that were,
you know,
fanatics for you know,
30 40 years.

474
00:26:26.091 --> 00:26:29.780
I started in the beginning when we came out in 1964 and was air cooled.

475
00:26:29.781 --> 00:26:30.491
So we'll start there.

476
00:26:30.491 --> 00:26:35.480
Start there all the way up to 98 literally people that were Porsche guys want it

477
00:26:35.481 --> 00:26:37.820
to jump off a cliff because they thought it was over.

478
00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.970
It was over because Portia announced they're going to water cooled and they were

479
00:26:40.971 --> 00:26:43.230
just like,
that's the end of Porsche.
And they went to water.
Cool.

480
00:26:43.231 --> 00:26:43.980
Because it was the only way

481
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.480
<v 4>to really get more horsepower that and I think it's cheaper to pee,
you know,</v>

482
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.010
in a way it's cheaper and to mass produce.
Cause they,

483
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:53.640
when they were air cooled they were making fewer cars.
Yeah.
Volume one volume.

484
00:26:53.641 --> 00:26:56.370
We're not,
you know,
they introduced the ball,
you know.
Actually that's not true.

485
00:26:56.371 --> 00:26:59.220
It wasn't 90 well 98 they made the last air cooled nine,

486
00:26:59.221 --> 00:27:03.960
nine three but in 97 they actually introduced the Boxster and that was the first

487
00:27:03.961 --> 00:27:08.950
water cooled.
So you wouldn't know about the box?
No,
I any my friend Lou clothes,

488
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:13.230
he had one.
It was an automatic,
God bless this great.
You know what's great about,

489
00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:17.490
doesn't it?
The exhaust pipe look really weird in the middle like that.

490
00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:22.300
It's a little weird.
I've seen one with two circles.
That's the,
that's the,

491
00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:26.310
that's the,
that's good.
The new one is beautiful.
It is actually.
Yeah.

492
00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:31.150
New Kilowatt and you came and you know they got this thing coming out 40 full.

493
00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:33.480
That's real.
It's happening.

494
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:39.710
Cayman gts are on steroids so it's like a gt three but I wouldn't go that far.

495
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:44.160
It's still,
it's still modern and all these guys,
you know,
do the shot,

496
00:27:44.161 --> 00:27:47.640
works tuning and take a bite out of the Cayman.
You know what's interesting,

497
00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:50.940
I'm becoming an old,
like a newer version of you,

498
00:27:50.941 --> 00:27:55.740
like a older grumpy sort of new car guy.
Because for me the new cog.
Yeah.

499
00:27:55.741 --> 00:27:58.890
Because the,
the golden era for me is the error of Joe's car.

500
00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:02.580
Nine nine seven nine nine seven gt three for most seven.

501
00:28:02.581 --> 00:28:04.980
I like the 961st Porsche

502
00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:12.020
turbo in 2003 I think today that nine nine six turbo is the best bang for the

503
00:28:13.141 --> 00:28:18.090
buck.
And you can put the 35 grand and really fast car.
Yeah.
But mine was a lemon.

504
00:28:18.091 --> 00:28:21.860
Mine broke down like crazy and I got away from Porsche's for awhile.
I'm an NSX.

505
00:28:21.861 --> 00:28:23.960
I went in for an Nsx and then I got rid of that NSX.

506
00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:26.280
I got another Nsx at two and a sexist,

507
00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:29.160
but then I found out about the gt three and I was reading about the road.

508
00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:33.510
My car broke down five times to replace the engine.

509
00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:37.920
The throttle with the throttle,
the fuel pump broke.

510
00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.250
So I just ran out of gas.
The fuel gauge broke,

511
00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:43.980
that's a clean problems.
He ran out of gas.

512
00:28:43.981 --> 00:28:48.840
The fuel pump broke as shit gets broke twice.
That was a really common problem.

513
00:28:48.841 --> 00:28:52.590
If you looked at it you would laugh cause you're thinking like a hundred and you

514
00:28:52.591 --> 00:28:57.591
know whatever $30,000 car and it's got this plastic piece of shite basically

515
00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:01.570
linking,
linking the floppy,
you know,

516
00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:06.360
shifter to the cables on the transmission and that thing would break on cars

517
00:29:06.361 --> 00:29:11.010
from 97 cause it's the same part in a bog standard box or to a turbo.

518
00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:14.660
And Yeah we always had to make like a billet part for the early cars shift.

519
00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:20.210
He made something much stronger actually a company in Arizona that that it's

520
00:29:20.461 --> 00:29:23.100
like a tuning partner for me,
Eva.
They make it and um,
yeah,

521
00:29:23.101 --> 00:29:25.650
it's just a little billet piece and then yeah,
you don't get,

522
00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:28.690
cause you know what happens.
You get stuck.
You can't shift,
you can't go anywhere.

523
00:29:28.691 --> 00:29:32.430
It's,
I got lucky.
Mine stuck in second gear.
That's a good year.
It was stuck off.

524
00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:35.840
That's a good year to the Porsche dealership.
That's a good gear to be stuck in.

525
00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:38.760
That car happened twice.
It's pretty stupid.
Why don't you get the GT three?

526
00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:42.130
I got the GG three year before

527
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:45.790
<v 1>I met you.
So was it 300 or 2010 you went hardcore math backwards.</v>

528
00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:48.130
I love the deal.
I loved it.

529
00:29:48.131 --> 00:29:50.830
But then I found out about the shark works cars and I was like,

530
00:29:50.831 --> 00:29:54.910
oh this motherfucker just took,
so my wife's video.
Yeah,

531
00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:57.490
I saw the video and then it was the cover of excellence.

532
00:29:57.491 --> 00:30:00.630
I think it was 3.9 was on it and they were talking,

533
00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:02.680
the guy was just raving about the engine.

534
00:30:02.681 --> 00:30:06.340
It was comparing the three plan must be your buddy,
right?
P S yeah.
Pete Stout.

535
00:30:06.341 --> 00:30:09.190
That was the,
and now he's in charge of Panorama.
That's right.

536
00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:13.630
So I got rid of the 2010 bought a 2007 had it sent to Alex,

537
00:30:13.631 --> 00:30:16.950
never even saw it,
didn't even see the car right off the showroom floor,

538
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:18.650
sent it right to even driven

539
00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:24.220
new stock and I talked to him like this motherfucker is exactly what I wanted to

540
00:30:24.221 --> 00:30:27.970
hear.
Everything you're saying,
I'm like,
that's my dog in the car.
We go,

541
00:30:27.971 --> 00:30:32.940
let's do it.
There it is said go crazy and crazy and I,
I loved that car.
What?

542
00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:35.980
Favorite road to go drive.
I love that Angel's crest.
Crescent heart man.

543
00:30:35.981 --> 00:30:40.380
I'd love to me of that.
No,
no.
I called them.

544
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:42.210
Oh you're going to say yeah.

545
00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:45.840
Well we were up there yesterday at the other side of it that had a big session.

546
00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:49.600
It's such a masterpiece.
When I drove it I was like,

547
00:30:49.601 --> 00:30:53.500
this is like better than any ride at Disneyland or six flags and I got to the

548
00:30:53.501 --> 00:30:57.370
bottom and those that when you drive a car like that on a crazy winding canyon

549
00:30:57.371 --> 00:30:58.450
road,
no one anywhere near.

550
00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:02.180
That's when you really understand what these cars are all relate to that God.

551
00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:05.500
It was so fun.
That was sort of how I connected to the GT two,
you know,

552
00:31:05.501 --> 00:31:09.630
and then just little by little eased into that car.
And then uh,
you know,

553
00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.500
these guys had already added performance.

554
00:31:11.501 --> 00:31:15.640
I just started a little bit of style and personality.
But you did a crazy,

555
00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:20.530
is there a best website to look at the images of the width of the version of the

556
00:31:20.531 --> 00:31:23.500
one that he created?
Basically.

557
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:25.720
Hey soul over soda grounds to cram.

558
00:31:25.721 --> 00:31:28.700
So if you go to like the shark works Instagram or Magnus Walker,
right?

559
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:30.290
You could see it.
I mean you just sort of like,

560
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:32.530
depending on what relationship to it,
it's on my Instagram,

561
00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:37.700
look at that guy was a Honda Teesha night guy.
Who the hell is that?

562
00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:42.040
That's a sexy looking gt.
Two to tell.
It looks like I got some holes in my jeans.

563
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:45.250
It looks good when you see it in person,
it's like the blue car

564
00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:50.440
and then you came and saw it and you were drinking coffee and I think I like it.

565
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:53.290
Yeah.
The 4.1,
when you see it in person,

566
00:31:53.291 --> 00:31:56.830
you see the blue and the orange [inaudible] that's where you go and you can hear

567
00:31:56.831 --> 00:31:58.450
it if you play it off that other one.

568
00:31:58.451 --> 00:32:03.050
There's a video of a Matt Farah driving by I think hearing that fit.
Yeah,

569
00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:06.310
I think so.
You can hear that.
That's just my Instagram.
Oh yeah.

570
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:12.130
Okay.
The folks that it looks pretty fast to come around that term.
That's,

571
00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:16.180
that's pretty cheeky,
right?
Have it British flag and Jack upside down.

572
00:32:16.181 --> 00:32:20.110
People are digging that vast.
She's then that's what these grids,
Union Jack on,

573
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:24.550
chairman,
chairman cost also.
You did the thing with the seat inserts.

574
00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:29.560
We took,
uh,
my wife and I took a UK tour right before Christmas.

575
00:32:29.561 --> 00:32:33.520
We did an event with Porsche in London and then went to see my mom in Sheffield

576
00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:36.720
and then went up to see my sister who lives in Aberdeen,
Scotland.
Bird theme.

577
00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:40.190
So a,
but dean,
we've got some iron blue.
Yes.
So,
you know,

578
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:42.710
<v 2>I'm a big fan of messing up interiors in cars,</v>

579
00:32:42.711 --> 00:32:46.700
but Porsche had been putting plat interiors or tighten interiors in these cars

580
00:32:46.701 --> 00:32:48.900
since the 70s and though it's hard,

581
00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:53.090
you know what you guys call it Thomson Tartan,
you know,

582
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:54.990
and they make a lot of that in Scotland,
you know them.

583
00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.910
Then we'll William Wallace dudes with the kilts in the spars and the Haggis.

584
00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:00.080
So anyway,
long story,

585
00:33:00.081 --> 00:33:02.750
short it up and show their Willie's or there are that thing.

586
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:07.100
I was just there for the top and fabric,
but I managed to find this time that,
uh,

587
00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:10.520
is almost the same colors that are on the car,
so I couldn't resist,

588
00:33:10.521 --> 00:33:14.210
just put in the inserts into the seat just to give it a little bit more

589
00:33:14.211 --> 00:33:17.150
character on the inside as well.
I mean,
when you open it,
you just go,

590
00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:19.250
does it make it drive any better?

591
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:22.430
But it just sort of looks like he's got a little bit more a style and

592
00:33:22.431 --> 00:33:26.960
personality.
The,
I bow down to you guys on this.
I just do that.

593
00:33:26.961 --> 00:33:31.090
That's your,
you're into it.
I like solid colors.
I don't like plat interiors,

594
00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:36.110
but honestly that car has a lot more character in a very unique,
weird way.

595
00:33:36.111 --> 00:33:38.330
Now that you've got a lot of person,
I wouldn't have done it.

596
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:42.080
But in and with the gold wheels,
yeah,
it does work.

597
00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:44.360
It really does help those three color combos,
you know,

598
00:33:44.361 --> 00:33:47.960
and just sort of Trifecta or I call it,
and like I say it's an acquired taste,

599
00:33:47.961 --> 00:33:52.610
but it's sort of a late sixties early seventies race inspired library

600
00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:54.830
interpreted onto a new car,
which is,

601
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:57.260
I don't think you'll see another car like that out there.

602
00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:00.290
And you see the privateer teams,

603
00:34:00.291 --> 00:34:03.860
you know from the seventies eighties that to me is when I see that car going

604
00:34:03.861 --> 00:34:04.900
down,
you know,

605
00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:08.810
as opposed to just being like a stealthy white nine 11 with a sort of big wing

606
00:34:08.811 --> 00:34:09.644
on it.

607
00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:15.810
That to me is the glory days of Porsche nine 11 came out in 64 the one Lamont in

608
00:34:16.071 --> 00:34:19.010
1970 so that first 10 years,
you know,

609
00:34:19.011 --> 00:34:23.030
Paul should you start a winning everything in the nine 11 nine 17 and that's

610
00:34:23.031 --> 00:34:25.370
just like the iconic sort of era.

611
00:34:25.371 --> 00:34:29.420
The beginning of everything has become this automotive legend that has gone on

612
00:34:29.421 --> 00:34:33.140
for 50 years and there's only two other cars that have been in production as

613
00:34:33.141 --> 00:34:37.940
long as the nine 11 the corvette,
which 10 years before I've got a 65 well,

614
00:34:37.941 --> 00:34:40.250
you know what I'm talking about then and uh,
everyone's favorite.

615
00:34:40.251 --> 00:34:44.660
The Mustang and I'm always forward that people don't do more Mustang Porsche

616
00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:47.780
sort of comparisons because to me I've,
around the same time,

617
00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:52.340
it came out the same time I owned a 65 Mustang gt three 50 our replica and the

618
00:34:52.341 --> 00:34:56.660
Mustang owner on the pusher on it and me are very similar in the sense that both

619
00:34:56.661 --> 00:35:01.490
of them love to customize the cars.
You know,
you see a lot of upgraded mustangs.

620
00:35:01.491 --> 00:35:03.770
I mean just look at all the Parnelli Jones,

621
00:35:03.771 --> 00:35:06.740
the Shelby's a bus three o two is you know,

622
00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:09.770
these factory conversions on the mustangs.

623
00:35:09.771 --> 00:35:12.200
It's just never ending the night 11 in a sense.

624
00:35:12.201 --> 00:35:14.150
He's sort of a similar thing and I think the owner,

625
00:35:14.151 --> 00:35:18.530
an enthusiast of the two cars share that common bond of the cars are easy to

626
00:35:18.531 --> 00:35:21.350
sort of upgrade for a performance point of view.

627
00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:23.780
Personalize them from an aesthetic point of view.

628
00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:28.220
And they've both been in continuous production for 50 years and the both icons.

629
00:35:28.221 --> 00:35:31.670
You look at Ford and I think you identify forward with the Mustang.

630
00:35:31.671 --> 00:35:35.630
You look at Ken Block and what he just did with his Jim Karna seven that thing

631
00:35:35.631 --> 00:35:38.130
is ridiculous monster.
And I was holding

632
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:43.080
<v 1>that video.
Well that is blocked Chicana seven I never had a Mustang,</v>

633
00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:46.800
but like in England,
if you,
if you were thinking of an iconic forward,

634
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:51.270
it was probably like a Ford Edge Se.
No,
well that too.
No,
no.

635
00:35:51.271 --> 00:35:53.600
It's a Ford escort XR three I,

636
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:58.080
it was the most stolen car he grew up in.
I think.
Here's the,
here's the video.

637
00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:01.290
First of all,
how beautiful is la look at night like that?
That is,

638
00:36:01.291 --> 00:36:04.430
I was fortunate enough to be a couple of hundred yards away from some of the

639
00:36:04.431 --> 00:36:06.240
scenes he's running on the,
you know,

640
00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:11.360
the guys that you work with on the wheels the same or 1552 wheel nine Mustang.

641
00:36:12.151 --> 00:36:15.480
Is that what it is?
What year is it?
Oh,
well truth be told,

642
00:36:15.481 --> 00:36:17.430
he's sort of a completely purpose built car,

643
00:36:17.431 --> 00:36:20.610
but the real Kido is 800 horsepower and four wheel drive.

644
00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:24.370
It's in sound believable and I think what they did for 40 in a way,

645
00:36:24.371 --> 00:36:27.410
ways bringing a whole new uh,
client,
uh,

646
00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:31.830
Fan into chem blocks world.
And also the Ford will throw this Mustang,

647
00:36:31.831 --> 00:36:35.370
which to me just looks like Darth Vader meets Mad Max on steroids.

648
00:36:35.371 --> 00:36:36.990
That is looking Mustang we've ever seen in my life.

649
00:36:36.991 --> 00:36:41.670
It's a 65 look on the fact that the try was a notch a notch back as opposed to a

650
00:36:41.671 --> 00:36:46.010
fastback.
Notchback and why does fender flares,

651
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:49.500
he's just a monster.
Look at this.
Unbelievable.

652
00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:53.280
He's going to spin the wheels.
Oh yeah.
Four wheel.

653
00:36:53.281 --> 00:36:55.620
It's got it hooked up to a chain.
All wheel drive,

654
00:36:55.621 --> 00:36:58.770
a Mustang spinning all four wheels on the sound.
You know,

655
00:36:58.771 --> 00:37:00.620
I'm not hearing that sound,
but he's just in

656
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:05.090
<v 6>see cadence.
There you go.
Unbelievable.
It won't go.</v>

657
00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:10.940
Only all wheel drive performance Mustang ever built.
What's

658
00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:14.240
<v 1>the benefit of having a car like this all wheel drive though,
Howard down better,</v>

659
00:37:14.241 --> 00:37:15.440
right?
Yeah,
but that's it,
right?

660
00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:17.570
It's going to change the hand where it makes more smoke.

661
00:37:17.571 --> 00:37:22.190
Even spoken all for this guy is a fucking mad man.
Yeah.

662
00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:27.200
He was driving to that video that he did with his Subaru where he's spinning

663
00:37:28.041 --> 00:37:30.320
around.
It's different objects that on top gear,
right.

664
00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:33.380
The control that he has in this thing.
I thought that San Francisco,

665
00:37:33.381 --> 00:37:36.420
Jim Karna five was the best until I saw this man.

666
00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:40.420
Salix is going on still that big,
but this one,
he's in downtown La.

667
00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:44.510
Go and sideways around every corner in the craziest fucking Mustang that's ever

668
00:37:44.511 --> 00:37:48.260
been built.
My mother in law sent me this video.
Have you seen this?
It's like,
yes,

669
00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:52.790
you're right about mustangs though in that Mustang's might be the most

670
00:37:52.791 --> 00:37:56.920
customized.
Every car without a doubt,
I would say.
I mean,

671
00:37:56.930 --> 00:38:00.200
what else has been around in production for 50 years and they're also one of the

672
00:38:00.201 --> 00:38:04.280
most radical cars as far as what you can buy,
the most radical,

673
00:38:04.281 --> 00:38:05.970
which you could buy straight from the factory.

674
00:38:05.971 --> 00:38:10.971
And they were the first to go completely hogwild that gt 500 with 668 horsepower

675
00:38:11.691 --> 00:38:14.990
mean,
what the fuck is that a road?
I mean,
that is bananas,

676
00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:21.160
bananas car to have a live rear axle in 2014 the new one,

677
00:38:22.821 --> 00:38:25.610
have you seen the new gt three 50?
They've gone the other way.

678
00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.040
They've lowered the horsepower down to 500.

679
00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:31.400
They've lightened up the car like that giant carbon brakes.

680
00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:36.040
And apparently with this new independent suspension,
it's a motherfucker as

681
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:40.270
<v 4>far as its handling,
it's supposed to see,
see,
honestly,</v>

682
00:38:40.271 --> 00:38:43.990
I would actually take a slightly less horsepower,
but lighter.

683
00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:45.850
I don't like that Ford Gt.
Aw.

684
00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:49.840
That was one of my old time favorite cards as a kid growing up.
The,
uh,

685
00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:54.070
the gen three 50 is the new Mustang.
That's a Ford Gt.
Yeah.

686
00:38:54.071 --> 00:38:57.150
The Ford Gt has a beautiful car prices on those ones.

687
00:38:57.151 --> 00:39:01.600
Paul and Chris doesn't modern version of it and modern one is just insane.

688
00:39:01.601 --> 00:39:04.660
Nobody ever drivers like the 300,000.
Well I had a friend who had,

689
00:39:04.661 --> 00:39:07.520
when he said it was dog shit,
he drove them.
It wasn't,
I was,

690
00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.390
it was a time when I was thinking of getting one.
It was the,

691
00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:14.620
the Gulf livery one obviously cause I like weird colors and you know it was

692
00:39:14.621 --> 00:39:17.230
around one 80 at the time.
So it was like the best time to buy it.

693
00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:21.120
And now I see they're like 400 grand but nobody ever drives those cars.
So yeah,

694
00:39:21.121 --> 00:39:24.020
that's the great thing.
About nine 11 was in Porsche's get shit out of him.

695
00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:25.940
You see a lot of high mileage pull.

696
00:39:25.941 --> 00:39:29.180
She don't see a lot of high mileage for old lamp.
Exactly.
Anything like that.

697
00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:31.240
You know one other thing about that,
what you just saw.

698
00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:35.320
So manual transmission is standard.

699
00:39:35.321 --> 00:39:40.210
That's all you can see.
How great is that?
Speed manual is the sole transmission.

700
00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:43.860
So l e n s o DOL bow down to that one of my,

701
00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:48.990
you like the sticker on it like the gt two,
the antitheft sticker.
The madness.

702
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:51.070
Yeah.
I love that Dan came up with that.

703
00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:54.490
I think it's felt well done roast that Porsche is not making manuals.

704
00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:58.420
It's really disappointed and that the worst thing is you know,

705
00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.910
well that came and she too full.
It's coming manual.

706
00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:04.270
That's going to ruffle a lot of feathers because guys are going to go like you,

707
00:40:04.271 --> 00:40:07.150
well nine nine one gt three guys.
You've got to go,

708
00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:11.020
how come I can't get a manual in nine nine one gt three is ripped the soul out

709
00:40:11.021 --> 00:40:14.070
of that car.
The out of the GT three program when they,
you know,

710
00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:17.690
said it's PDK only,
you know,
I get that they have to compete with you know,

711
00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:20.320
the Nissan Gtr or the [inaudible] and all these,

712
00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:22.840
all these cars that are basically,
you know,
automatic.

713
00:40:22.841 --> 00:40:25.180
Can you just push a button and it does everything for you?
They go,

714
00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:28.300
well actually you do have to still push them playing numbers.

715
00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.270
They're all children.
And even on Norberg ring,

716
00:40:31.271 --> 00:40:34.630
they can't compete unless I agreed.

717
00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:36.370
But they tell us about the journey.

718
00:40:36.371 --> 00:40:39.070
I think you know the interaction and you know the control.

719
00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:41.410
You put it into the charm in the leg,
you know,

720
00:40:41.411 --> 00:40:43.160
you're just like your full night's sleep.

721
00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:48.220
The nine nine one gt three is honestly the first gt three ever that I've been

722
00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:49.750
sort of Borden,
you know,

723
00:40:49.751 --> 00:40:52.930
it's a gt three r being bored and I'm like pushing buttons cause I see,

724
00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:54.610
oh it's got some new buttons.
What does this do?

725
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:58.810
Well instead of like actually going,
wow,
I'm really engaged.
Don't get me wrong,

726
00:40:58.811 --> 00:41:01.990
it's a great car for a first time Porsche by our spas.

727
00:41:01.991 --> 00:41:06.700
But that's who's buying them usually and not the hardcore gt three guys who

728
00:41:06.701 --> 00:41:08.080
don't really know how to drive a manual.

729
00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:12.490
I have a friend who's wealthy who doesn't know how to drive a manual.
And I go,

730
00:41:12.491 --> 00:41:16.240
listen,
I go right a car,
I go rent a car for it.
No he doesn't.

731
00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:19.770
But he's thinking about getting my little dog fight.
I go rent,
rent a car,

732
00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:22.840
rent it for the weekend and beat the shit out of it.
Learned how to drive.

733
00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:26.920
You can learn how to drive it in 10 minutes.
It's not hard.
It's like eh,

734
00:41:26.921 --> 00:41:31.720
that's shit.
Look into exactly how power ain't going to be.

735
00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:35.420
And I say covers all the sensors.
That to me is a great thing about driving.

736
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:37.910
I think ultimately it doesn't matter what car you drive,

737
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:42.380
but what matters is being engaged and involved in that experience,

738
00:41:42.381 --> 00:41:45.710
which covers sight,
sound,
feel,
touch,
you know,

739
00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:49.970
two hands and two feet in the canyons.
Once you get bored,
just,

740
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:53.300
just all you would do is put,
cause you probably not even push buttons anymore,

741
00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:57.710
but you just push the gas and you're going around and it's like,
okay now what?

742
00:41:57.711 --> 00:41:59.750
My arms not doing anything.
My legs not doing anything.

743
00:41:59.751 --> 00:42:01.840
I'm not getting that feedback.
It's my daughter.

744
00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:07.400
I have three is a PDK car.
Yeah.
Essential.
It does.

745
00:42:07.401 --> 00:42:11.330
Great.
I,
it's my traffic car traffic chart.

746
00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:15.890
It's great because it,
he loves Graham.
Yeah.
Constantly.
I'm the opposite.

747
00:42:15.891 --> 00:42:19.790
I lived 200 yards from where I work.
So for me,
80% of my driving,

748
00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:21.080
walking pure pleasure.

749
00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:25.610
Do you have like a regular car that you drive or do you come,
well hold on,

750
00:42:25.611 --> 00:42:29.630
hold on.
I Walk to work.
So I got the garage full of cars.
I Walk to work.

751
00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:34.310
I have my wife Karen,
her car,
what I call the wife's car is a regular car.

752
00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:39.530
Four door car.
The BMW.
I am so much shit for that.
You know it's funny.

753
00:42:39.531 --> 00:42:42.170
The BMW.
No,
no,
but I mean it's,
it's,
you know,

754
00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:45.860
the funny thing is when bespoke four door and they look at me and go,

755
00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:49.880
the puzzle Lug,
they go on you that push.
You got to go.
Yeah.
They go,

756
00:42:49.881 --> 00:42:54.680
what are you doing driving a BMW?
I go,
it's my wife's car still great car.
Three,

757
00:42:54.681 --> 00:42:59.630
three five I BMW,
you know,
sort of for driving it.
No,
come on.

758
00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:02.530
I have a two thousand twelve billion out of 10 the iPhone.

759
00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:06.830
But you know what I really liked?
I liked the generation before mine.
The,

760
00:43:06.831 --> 00:43:10.290
you know,
the one with 333 horsepower,
the [inaudible] 46 yes.

761
00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:13.040
That's a beautiful car,
man.
So a lot of people may track

762
00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:16.010
sort of track cars out of those.

763
00:43:16.011 --> 00:43:21.011
And then even the eat 36 that's like probably the most common sort of,

764
00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:25.570
you know,
like get into know tracking other than them Yada.
That's,
you know,

765
00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:29.570
eat 36 m three is when those common truck on silver I've seen.

766
00:43:29.571 --> 00:43:34.460
So I always loved the 2002 Tii and the 3.0 Batmobile going older,

767
00:43:34.461 --> 00:43:38.370
old school,
go back to old school,
seven eight always go back.
Why is that?
Why,

768
00:43:38.371 --> 00:43:42.260
why are you a solo things my age,
my era,
you know,
I'm 48 so I grew up,

769
00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:47.210
born in 67 grew up in the 70s well thanks.
You know,
so as a kid,

770
00:43:47.211 --> 00:43:48.890
those are those informative years.

771
00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:53.420
Alex is a little bit younger so I think his point of reference is eighties my

772
00:43:53.421 --> 00:43:54.071
point of reference,

773
00:43:54.071 --> 00:43:58.490
his seventies and I remember watching motor racing on TV on grand stand on a

774
00:43:58.491 --> 00:44:03.491
Saturday watching a sports program in England on the BBC two channels I think.

775
00:44:04.401 --> 00:44:04.791
No,
no.

776
00:44:04.791 --> 00:44:09.430
We had three from 1982 they introduced free channels and then I think it was 82

777
00:44:09.431 --> 00:44:12.290
or 80,
BBC two and ITV,
they went with,

778
00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:14.720
now we're going to unveil channel four.

779
00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:18.500
And literally the entire country stopped as if it was a royal wedding.
Right.

780
00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:22.520
And the very first program was this thing called countdown,
right.

781
00:44:22.521 --> 00:44:25.100
Which was like a game show where,
you know,

782
00:44:25.101 --> 00:44:28.580
they would have like their pick letters and you'd go,
I'd like a vowel please,

783
00:44:28.581 --> 00:44:30.910
or I'd like a consonant please.
And they put it up and you'd,

784
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.220
you'd sort of have to fill

785
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:36.180
<v 3>in the blanks,
you know,
and they'd have celebrities and stuff and they'd go,
okay,</v>

786
00:44:36.181 --> 00:44:39.390
well,
you know,
give me an a,
give me a,
you know,
sorry,
give me a letter.

787
00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:41.730
And you know,
you'd make a word out of it.
And it was like,

788
00:44:41.731 --> 00:44:45.780
that was the first program to launch the channel forward.
And you're like,

789
00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:50.680
<v 2>well,
I don't remember that.
I remember a old grey whistle test,
top of the pops.</v>

790
00:44:50.681 --> 00:44:53.150
They were,
the music shows top of the pops up

791
00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:57.880
every Thursday,
top of the pops.
And then,
uh,

792
00:44:58.150 --> 00:45:02.020
what was channel four's music show in the 80s?
Oh,
that was a,

793
00:45:02.021 --> 00:45:06.010
it was with Paula Yates,
Marin.
Bob Geldof it,
um,

794
00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:10.330
I think to the,
to that was it,
this is pre MTV,

795
00:45:10.331 --> 00:45:12.520
so it actually is going back.
It was pretty trendy.

796
00:45:12.521 --> 00:45:16.120
They had some really good bands on it,
you know,
sort of a cool era of music.

797
00:45:16.121 --> 00:45:20.140
You know,
my thing growing up was I'm from Sheffield,
so Sheffield was sort of,

798
00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:23.800
I portray at grim northern steel town,
but it was also a great music town.

799
00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:25.000
You know,
Joe Cocker,

800
00:45:25.001 --> 00:45:30.001
who recently passed away from us from Sheffield died recently a couple of weeks

801
00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:34.090
ago.
But when I was a teenager,
you know,
late seventies,
early eighties,

802
00:45:34.091 --> 00:45:36.310
Sheffield was known for its new wave bands,

803
00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:39.880
human league having 17 ABC cabaret Voltaire.

804
00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:44.200
But the flip side through it was def Leppard,
Saxon heavy metal music.

805
00:45:44.201 --> 00:45:47.260
So Sheffield's always had a great musical vibe.

806
00:45:47.261 --> 00:45:51.160
I guess the current Pinup band from Sheffield,
Arctic monkeys,

807
00:45:51.161 --> 00:45:55.720
which are sort of those guys,
she had all these northern environment towns,

808
00:45:55.721 --> 00:46:00.190
you know,
Manchester,
Sheffield,
Leeds,
Liverpool.
I think the breed creativity,

809
00:46:00.191 --> 00:46:03.100
cause you know,
people are just looking for a way out,
something different.

810
00:46:03.101 --> 00:46:06.100
You know,
back then in the 70s,
it was pretty depressed.

811
00:46:06.101 --> 00:46:09.520
Steel mills closing down coal mines closing down.

812
00:46:09.521 --> 00:46:13.810
So miners for exit,
well we'll talk about that later.
Not your favorite subject.

813
00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:18.750
<v 3>So there was a,
uh,
there was a movie I saw recently called pride,
you know,</v>

814
00:46:18.751 --> 00:46:22.200
you like English sort of humor,
black humor movies.
Um,

815
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:25.330
and this is gonna sound weird.
It's like full Monty on steroids.
It's,

816
00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:29.260
it's called pride should look it up.
Um,
small sort of British movie.

817
00:46:29.261 --> 00:46:31.320
We'll probably win some awards came out this year,

818
00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:36.270
but it's about the coal mining strike in the 80s,
which I remember growing up,

819
00:46:36.271 --> 00:46:37.104
you know,

820
00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:43.530
the coal miners practically chancre down when the miners went on strike.
Exactly.

821
00:46:43.531 --> 00:46:48.150
Everyone was on strike and there was police brutality towards the miners that

822
00:46:48.151 --> 00:46:52.850
were striking.
But there was also police brutality to gays and let,

823
00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:55.170
well not lesbians,
but gays mostly at the time.

824
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:59.460
Cause lesbian gets brutal with lesbians.
Well you don't mess with,

825
00:46:59.570 --> 00:47:04.140
you don't mess with that.
So in London and,

826
00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:08.070
and you know,
they were,
they were activists and they were thinking,
well,

827
00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:09.930
nobody's taking us seriously,

828
00:47:09.931 --> 00:47:13.960
but we have something in common with these miners in the middle of Wales.

829
00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:18.750
Wales is this thread.
Do you know what that is?
Yeah,
I know you said it before.

830
00:47:18.751 --> 00:47:22.440
It's,
it's the,
uh,
uh,
I'll let you say since you are the dirty minded one,

831
00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:27.900
but yeah,
you've got about a black hole,
black hole.
I know,

832
00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:31.750
I know.
How dare you.
But they are,
you know,

833
00:47:31.751 --> 00:47:34.950
being beaten on a daily basis and you know,
base,

834
00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:39.730
you're just just penalized for being gay.
And they're like,

835
00:47:39.731 --> 00:47:40.150
well,

836
00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:43.160
we have a lot of in common with these coal miners right now what we're going to

837
00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:48.170
do is we're going to form this coalition called gays and Lesbians for minors,

838
00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:51.730
you know,
coalition and we're going to raise money for them.

839
00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:54.040
And so what happened is,
you know,

840
00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:57.640
they would raise money since all these miners were out of jobs and striking,

841
00:47:57.940 --> 00:48:01.630
you know,
on the,
on the streets.
So you can imagine in,
you know,
the 70s and sorry,

842
00:48:01.631 --> 00:48:06.550
an eighties,
the early eighties,
you know,
gay people on the street going,
hey,

843
00:48:06.551 --> 00:48:10.120
would you like to donate to the miners of Wales for gays and lesbians,
you know,

844
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:11.650
were gays and lesbians,
would you like to donate?

845
00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:15.010
And they're kind of looks and things where like that's,

846
00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:19.000
that's an interesting thing.
Yeah,
it's really cool.
So then,
you know,
they,

847
00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:21.760
they get all this money and they end up actually getting a lot of money for

848
00:48:21.761 --> 00:48:24.730
these minors and they go visit them in Wales.
They get in a,

849
00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:28.120
in a bang boss basically and go visit them.
Um,

850
00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:32.230
and when they get there,
you know,
you have to fear,
you have to realize that,

851
00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:34.600
you know,
these are coal miners.
There's probably,

852
00:48:34.601 --> 00:48:38.710
there's probably homosexuality there underneath,
but what are you trying to say

853
00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:41.300
that they go digging?
Yeah.

854
00:48:41.370 --> 00:48:45.930
<v 4>Guests for coal,
fossil fuel things.
It's about doing the fossils,</v>

855
00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:49.410
thinking you're doing it wrong.
I haven't done it,
but yeah.

856
00:48:49.411 --> 00:48:53.400
So I don't know.
I don't know.
I've read books about it.

857
00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:56.630
I just shake their head and go,
yeah,
this is not the right tech technique.
Well,

858
00:48:56.650 --> 00:49:00.430
the different than the Ewan Mcgregor coal mining brassed off movie rights.

859
00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:02.310
It is about the brass band.
Yes.

860
00:49:02.890 --> 00:49:06.460
<v 3>But they get there and there's this hundred and five year old,
you know,</v>

861
00:49:06.461 --> 00:49:07.430
grandma that's,
you know,

862
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:12.430
pouring tea for all the miners at their club and working man's club.

863
00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:16.960
And she's,
and she's just like,
you know,
whatever the guy's name is,

864
00:49:16.961 --> 00:49:19.720
who is in charge of them.
She goes,
your gaze or here,

865
00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:22.840
<v 4>you know,
and it's like the whole place just stand still</v>

866
00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:25.680
<v 3>and you know,
they're bringing money for them and they form a bond.</v>

867
00:49:25.890 --> 00:49:28.260
They actually kind of turn them around.
It's happy go lucky.

868
00:49:28.261 --> 00:49:30.990
But then not to put a damper on it,
but then,
you know,

869
00:49:30.991 --> 00:49:32.880
the main guy gets his was one of the,

870
00:49:33.090 --> 00:49:36.300
he's the second person with the uh,

871
00:49:36.330 --> 00:49:41.220
to contract aids in a,
in the UK said he died.
Sorry.
But the other,
sorry,

872
00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:42.240
the f

873
00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:45.240
<v 4>and the other guy does,
sorry.
Well,
the other guy leaves.</v>

874
00:49:45.570 --> 00:49:46.890
The other guy does live here,

875
00:49:46.891 --> 00:49:51.510
that Russia recently ban transgender people from driving from drive.

876
00:49:51.511 --> 00:49:53.880
How would that impede anyone from driving properly?
Well,

877
00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:57.930
you got to not dress like a woman or dress like a man.
If you're a woman,

878
00:49:58.770 --> 00:50:03.180
could you?
Oh,
you mean,
I don't know.
I think Trans transgender transsexual trends,

879
00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:06.780
trends,
anything,
any transmission.

880
00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:11.790
PDK transmission.
Yes.
I like they have bouncing around male transmission.

881
00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:16.570
That doesn't make any sense.
If they're holding a stick,
Russian is um,
they're,

882
00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:21.340
they're so archaic with their,
their views on homosexuality or kicking him.
Dave,

883
00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:24.880
Dave like decided to just literally ban.

884
00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:28.290
There's documentaries on that too.

885
00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:33.590
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.
They'd go head hunting for them.
Like,
you know,
really crazy.
It's a,</v>

886
00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:38.130
that country is falling apart right before our eyes and coincidentally it

887
00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:41.710
doesn't make a good sports car.
Russia.
Yeah.
No.
Well they know what they did.

888
00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:46.010
They remember that the Russia,
they did,
they bought the,

889
00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:49.130
the worst British car company you could possibly buy.

890
00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:52.880
They remember that Russian guy.
He was like a 20 year old kid,
billionaire.

891
00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:55.260
He bought TVR Trevor out of black.
Yeah,

892
00:50:55.310 --> 00:50:57.940
he bought and that's not a good car company.
I mean they,

893
00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:01.320
<v 1>I like the styling.
The styling's good.
Just don't drive it.
Just don't cut it.</v>

894
00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:04.100
Windshield falls off the boat load of power.

895
00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:08.530
<v 3>Remember I remember that,
uh,
top gear episode where,
you know,
he's testing like,</v>

896
00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:12.270
you know,
one of those weird looking TVRS with the paint,
you know,
from the mid,

897
00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:15.140
early two thousands and uh,
you know,
the,

898
00:51:15.141 --> 00:51:19.440
the windshield wiper actually just like flies off.
I mean,
it's a factory car.

899
00:51:19.441 --> 00:51:21.480
It just flies off going 120 miles an hour.

900
00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:24.530
<v 1>Yes.
This is how crazy rush is.
They've,</v>

901
00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:27.440
they've lumped it all in with rational ideas.

902
00:51:27.441 --> 00:51:28.970
Like you shouldn't be allowed to drive.

903
00:51:28.971 --> 00:51:32.300
Your blind shouldn't be allowed to drive if you have like probably a good idea.

904
00:51:32.310 --> 00:51:35.720
Right?
Yeah.
And then along with that,
they,

905
00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:40.820
they listed the desire to live and be accepted as a member of the opposite sex

906
00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:45.970
and people who wear clothes of the opposite sex in order to experience temporary

907
00:51:46.101 --> 00:51:49.070
membership of the opposite sex.
Those people,

908
00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:53.290
what was the truck drivers must not have sex disorders.
So what was in,

909
00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:56.560
can you have sex in a car in Russia though?
I hope so.
Yeah.

910
00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:02.630
<v 3>Going on since the communist era for sure.
But the crazy part is that,
um,</v>

911
00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:05.330
you know,
they had their first f one race there.
Right.

912
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:08.630
And sort of like coming to Texas,
you know,
a black guy,

913
00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:11.590
Lewis Hamilton wins the first race.
You know,
it's,

914
00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:13.670
they don't see many black people in Russia.

915
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:16.760
I mean it's a very sort of white place.
It's,
it's actually quite racist.

916
00:52:16.970 --> 00:52:21.520
I know because,
um,
I have Russian blood in me.
Unfortunately.

917
00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:24.410
That's the racist party.
You No,
no,
not at all.
Not at all.
Actually,

918
00:52:24.411 --> 00:52:28.490
I was born and raised in London,
very cosmopolitan.
I have many,

919
00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:31.960
many green,
yellow,
you know,
black,

920
00:52:32.050 --> 00:52:35.570
<v 1>he's a lot of United colors of Benetton.
Really?
Oh,
there we go.
That's right.</v>

921
00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:39.050
I remember that.
I remember those.
I always think of them as American apparel,

922
00:52:39.051 --> 00:52:43.560
like CD,
basement,
wood paneling.
And that's how I look at it.
But she,
she's,
she,

923
00:52:43.561 --> 00:52:47.750
she got kicked out of a memo saying that you say factory episode you did down at

924
00:52:47.751 --> 00:52:51.390
the American apparel.
A facility down down,
down there.
Alim downtown.
Yeah.

925
00:52:51.810 --> 00:52:52.431
Speaking of which,

926
00:52:52.431 --> 00:52:56.810
our t shirts I made by them free month by the same guys that make it for Tesla.

927
00:52:56.811 --> 00:53:00.950
So it's all here.
The main guy was supposed to be very weird.

928
00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:05.240
Eccentric of shady.
Creepy,
creepy isn't he?

929
00:53:05.330 --> 00:53:08.790
Like there's all these articles about them does seem to a trial.

930
00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:11.090
Just pay the bill.
We just pay the bills for it.
I don't know.

931
00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:13.730
I'm ready to kick him out of the company and somehow now they bought his way

932
00:53:13.731 --> 00:53:17.570
back in and they a huge pretty quick,
you know,
still is everywhere and you know,

933
00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:21.020
yeah.
Well it's all over the windows in their underwear and wood panel.

934
00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:27.750
<v 3>It's actually about that company is,
I'm on the labels,
you know,
we can,</v>

935
00:53:27.810 --> 00:53:32.040
we can specify what we want.
So like you know that blue,
that bright blue thing,

936
00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:34.200
you know,
it's not that one cause that's a demo.

937
00:53:34.201 --> 00:53:38.490
But we're going to have labels that say,
you know,
smell no where until it smells.

938
00:53:38.491 --> 00:53:41.160
Yeah,
no,
this was made by,
you know,

939
00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:45.350
people over the age of 12 you know,
that didn't,
that didn't,
you know,

940
00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:48.870
earn 1 cent a month.
You know,
it wasn't exploited,
you know.

941
00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:52.980
<v 1>Well that's a whole big thing.
Surely verticals done in La real wages.</v>

942
00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:58.430
So it right there on,
yeah.
Well I've been to their fans,

943
00:53:58.440 --> 00:53:59.690
no shark fins in it.

944
00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:02.580
There are regularly like a million square feet of production down there.

945
00:54:02.581 --> 00:54:05.160
It's unbelievable.
Well it's the,
the front though,

946
00:54:05.161 --> 00:54:09.650
cause I'd be really disappointed she made in Honduras,
made a factory.

947
00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:13.770
DTLS I've walked down through there.
I've actually,
what,
when we're filming there,

948
00:54:13.771 --> 00:54:16.200
we actually walked through their factory.
Yeah.
But this,

949
00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:19.230
<v 3>what happened,
this is going back to the geeky thing.
Sorry.</v>

950
00:54:19.231 --> 00:54:22.320
But when I was still talking about England and four channel talking about

951
00:54:22.321 --> 00:54:26.830
whatever the fuck no,
but when,
so 1998,
you know,
I'm out of a universe,

952
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:27.780
97 actually,

953
00:54:27.781 --> 00:54:31.860
I'm out of a university and I'm doing this website thing and I'm going to,

954
00:54:31.861 --> 00:54:33.930
you know what cs is right now.

955
00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:39.010
So it used to be called on the Big Bang theory for Geeks or that that's come a

956
00:54:39.011 --> 00:54:42.890
big bang theory.
There's wine.
Yes.
Wang Chung.

957
00:54:43.590 --> 00:54:48.450
Um,
I was invited to go and speak in Taipei at the,
you know,

958
00:54:48.451 --> 00:54:53.100
like the Chinese version of it.
Um,
and you know,
I went there and result,
you know,

959
00:54:53.101 --> 00:54:57.790
you got to visit all these motherboard companies in Taiwan.
Um,
and uh,

960
00:54:58.020 --> 00:54:59.760
you're like,
oh,
this is where I get my,
you know,

961
00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:02.520
a Seuss motherboard and I overclock it.
And they're like,
oh,

962
00:55:02.521 --> 00:55:06.000
thank you for mentioning us and all this stuff.
Yeah,
he knows,
he knows.
Sorry,

963
00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:09.400
computer and a,

964
00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:14.820
my printer the other day and there's all these rather nice factories in Taiwan,

965
00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:19.710
but you're sorta like,
can look in there and going,
this isn't made in Taiwan.

966
00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:21.150
There's no actually doing anything.

967
00:55:21.151 --> 00:55:24.420
All they're doing is taking these things and boxing them and there's like dust

968
00:55:24.421 --> 00:55:26.220
that thick on the,
uh,
you know,

969
00:55:26.250 --> 00:55:29.340
on the equipment and on the tables and you start to realize actually what

970
00:55:29.341 --> 00:55:32.140
they're doing is they're making it in China for way,
way less,
you know?

971
00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:34.170
Sorry to break that,
but it was disappointing.

972
00:55:34.290 --> 00:55:36.380
<v 1>Oh,
so they make them in China and they box it up.</v>

973
00:55:36.450 --> 00:55:38.820
<v 3>Yeah.
But it looks like they're made.
And so I was just saying,</v>

974
00:55:38.821 --> 00:55:42.630
I hope it's not like that with those tee shirts because I'm very,

975
00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:46.470
I wanted to go with a company that was local,
keep it sort of,
you know,

976
00:55:46.471 --> 00:55:50.520
in California.
I don't care about paying more for it,
but I feel at local,
well,

977
00:55:50.521 --> 00:55:51.780
I feel bad for,
you know,

978
00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:55.770
12 year old kids or whatever in Honduras or wherever it is,
you know,

979
00:55:56.190 --> 00:55:57.880
earning a dollar a month,
you know,

980
00:55:57.900 --> 00:56:01.560
to work 20 hours a day to make a t shirt that I can sell for,
you know,
whatever,

981
00:56:01.561 --> 00:56:02.940
30 bucks and it doesn't feel good.

982
00:56:03.490 --> 00:56:05.560
<v 1>Yeah.
That whole thing that he really doesn't,</v>

983
00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:10.930
something happened in America where they started moving almost all of our

984
00:56:10.931 --> 00:56:15.460
factories and all of our overseas.
Yeah.
All,
I mean,
most of the cars.

985
00:56:15.610 --> 00:56:18.850
So I mean,
look at what happened to Detroit.
Detroit was essentially gutted.

986
00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:24.180
I mean,
Detroit's [inaudible] cars,
Detroit,
I mean that it's like a ghost.
You

987
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:26.500
<v 4>couldn't have picked a better one.
You know,
I flew to New York,</v>

988
00:56:26.501 --> 00:56:29.980
took a Trailways bus from New York to Detroit,
worked at a summer camp with kids.

989
00:56:29.981 --> 00:56:34.840
That was how I got to America in 1986.
And then spent some time in Detroit,

990
00:56:34.841 --> 00:56:38.110
which looks great from Windsor.
If you go across the,
uh,
the,

991
00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:42.460
say you didn't have your driver's license.
I didn't drive in England,
Iowa.

992
00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:45.790
You know,
as a kid growing up,
nobody had co we couldn't afford one.
First of all,

993
00:56:45.791 --> 00:56:49.090
that was weak at and either she spent everything on my step one score on the bus

994
00:56:49.091 --> 00:56:52.440
for five p.
But you know,
it's,
uh,
you can go back now and be it,

995
00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:56.920
get an old age pension of free passes almost.
You know,
what does that AAP,

996
00:56:56.921 --> 00:57:00.790
once you get to 40 50 I'm almost as close.

997
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:04.000
I will say though,
just for the record,
the first car I ever bought,

998
00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:06.160
I bought it here in Nla,

999
00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:11.460
passed my driver's test in La I think in 1987 when I was 20 at the Santa Monica

1000
00:57:12.490 --> 00:57:17.490
Dmv in in 1977 Toyota Corolla two TC that I paid 200 bucks for it cause I was

1001
00:57:18.401 --> 00:57:21.730
the very first guy on second car was a Sipe turbo,

1002
00:57:21.790 --> 00:57:26.790
900 SPG and the third one was a nine 11 is what do you guys feel as as

1003
00:57:27.221 --> 00:57:29.860
Englishman living in America?
Top gear,

1004
00:57:29.890 --> 00:57:34.630
the number one television show.
So I all time when it comes to cars,

1005
00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:39.820
but Jeremy Clarkson is pretty adamant about being like Antique Porsche.
Yeah,

1006
00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:44.590
he's,
he's,
he's known to be had about Porsches and that's okay.
He actually,

1007
00:57:44.591 --> 00:57:48.160
there's this episode I believe it's,
they love caravans on top gear.

1008
00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:51.040
It's before the new sort of format.

1009
00:57:51.490 --> 00:57:55.360
I think it was either late nineties or early 2000 you should look this up,

1010
00:57:55.361 --> 00:57:56.194
but if you look at that video,

1011
00:57:56.200 --> 00:58:00.640
it's on youtube by now he takes what now is probably a six.

1012
00:58:00.790 --> 00:58:04.450
I was probably a 60 $70,000 nine 11 it was like a,

1013
00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:07.450
you know 73 yeah,
John a piano on it.

1014
00:58:08.030 --> 00:58:12.820
He tries to destroy it.
Hits walls where they're going.
Yeah.

1015
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.740
That must've been the first generation that show.

1016
00:58:14.741 --> 00:58:17.960
Initially it was cancer was canned because Tiffany dome was on the phone.

1017
00:58:17.970 --> 00:58:21.010
That's what I grew up watching and I think you mentioned this with Chris Harris,

1018
00:58:21.011 --> 00:58:23.680
how Tiffany Dell drove with him and stuff and yeah,

1019
00:58:23.681 --> 00:58:26.110
that's what I grew up watching nation and from what I can gather,

1020
00:58:26.111 --> 00:58:27.460
she liked it better than,

1021
00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:31.450
I mean it's really spectacular now with all the explosions and all the
silliness,

1022
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:35.050
but it's sort of like jackass for car guys.

1023
00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:37.150
Tiffany Dellschau fifth gear.

1024
00:58:37.151 --> 00:58:40.060
I did that show and that seems to be a bit more of a serious,

1025
00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:43.720
well all of them can drive to and what's her name?
Vicky who used to be on there.

1026
00:58:43.721 --> 00:58:48.310
He is right there with this car.
Oh Dude,
your man is on point.

1027
00:58:48.311 --> 00:58:51.200
Look at that.
I wouldn't have found it.
Let me look at it.
And he's got,

1028
00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:53.440
he doesn't even have a smashed that car though.

1029
00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:57.490
I mean that is a fucking beautiful government is then these cars were under 10

1030
00:58:57.491 --> 00:59:00.850
grand all day long now.
Isn't that amazing?
It's amazing.

1031
00:59:00.851 --> 00:59:03.280
Our prices doubled and then tripled.

1032
00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:08.640
Like what is a like a 1972 like really nine 11 hours left this in this well

1033
00:59:09.971 --> 00:59:13.060
prepared wall.
Two to 300 grand.

1034
00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:17.920
That's include a 73 Rs.
He drives a fucking piano on it.
Don't do it Jeremy.

1035
00:59:17.970 --> 00:59:22.640
Yep.
That's the final on camera.
Ah Fuck Man.
No,

1036
00:59:22.641 --> 00:59:25.490
but he does way worse.
He goes into like walls.
He just,

1037
00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:27.350
he cripples the thing and it just keeps on going.

1038
00:59:27.351 --> 00:59:30.370
That's the joke about it really.
But it's kind of fucked up to that car.

1039
00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:34.610
Takes it to beating.
They are rock solid walnut man.
Yeah,
they are.
Well,
okay.

1040
00:59:34.650 --> 00:59:38.940
I mean,
who would've thought,
you know,
we're,
we're racing around in the,
in the,

1041
00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:43.760
in the canyons in a 71 it's just set up right.
You know?
Yeah.
To 77 well,

1042
00:59:43.790 --> 00:59:48.020
44 years old now.
Yeah.
That thing's know aging very well.

1043
00:59:48.670 --> 00:59:51.920
Yeah.
Yeah.
Those cars are amazing.
I feel bad just watching that.
Actually.

1044
00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:54.080
It doesn't do well.
It is crazy though.

1045
00:59:54.860 --> 00:59:58.320
I'd rather watch those other videos with that you found last time of like,
boom.

1046
00:59:58.380 --> 01:00:02.660
He know people making love to orangutans or,
or no,

1047
01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:07.100
no,
no,
no,
no.
It was,
no,
no,
I think,
no,
it wasn't that.
It was,

1048
01:00:07.101 --> 01:00:09.950
you were saying a horse was banging a dude.
That was true.

1049
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:13.960
That was the one that you were,
you were really high on that one last time.
Hey,

1050
01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:17.360
with the language.
Sorry.
No,
no,
no.
I'm shocked.

1051
01:00:18.410 --> 01:00:22.960
Pulse raced,
disturbed commodity on.
No,

1052
01:00:23.570 --> 01:00:27.500
that's a good job.
Said like the movie Avatar.

1053
01:00:27.501 --> 01:00:32.270
I enjoyed that high on that
actually.

1054
01:00:32.271 --> 01:00:35.660
And it was in your standup too.
You said the noise that that guy makes,

1055
01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:39.650
we'll stay with you for the entire life.
Well,
it will entirely for watched it.

1056
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:44.090
I didn't watch you make the noise is as good as watching it.
You made the noise.

1057
01:00:44.091 --> 01:00:46.270
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
I don't,
I don't want to.
It was,

1058
01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:49.130
it was coal mining in somewhere in London,
Kentucky,
yourself thing.

1059
01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:52.550
Back to my original point.
Did you ever want to get Jeremy Clarkson,

1060
01:00:52.551 --> 01:00:57.170
one of your four point ones?
I mean I want that guy to drive that.
Not Him,

1061
01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:02.120
not him,
but actually Richard Hammond,
but he likes portion.
He had a gt three Rs,

1062
01:01:02.121 --> 01:01:06.260
a green one like ours.
I really wanted him to drive ours because I think he,

1063
01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:09.110
he understand it.
Clarkson,
first of all,

1064
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:12.530
he wouldn't fit in the seat because he's a bit of a Chubby tubby guy.

1065
01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:17.120
Matt Farah fits in.
How the fuck could Clarkston not fit in?
That's true.
Actually.

1066
01:01:17.121 --> 01:01:20.120
He just said on the way,
however that when we were driving his car,

1067
01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:23.420
when Matt Frost side on it,
it's developed and new creeks that might want,

1068
01:01:23.490 --> 01:01:27.610
it wasn't there before
Craig,

1069
01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:31.760
that's on the passenger side and it wasn't there yet as good solid two 50 if not

1070
01:01:31.761 --> 01:01:35.690
higher.
The weight distribution was a little bit different with him in the,
yeah,

1071
01:01:35.730 --> 01:01:39.170
he could,
he could go on a little bit of a diet.
It'd be better.
Nice guy though.

1072
01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:42.320
He's super [inaudible] 77 so that was good.

1073
01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:44.090
I think he had fun in the GT two as well.

1074
01:01:44.110 --> 01:01:47.940
But it was raving about your two 77 raving about the way it handles about,

1075
01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:51.410
I think it surprised.
Yeah,
no I,
Matt,

1076
01:01:51.411 --> 01:01:54.680
Matt sort of got it towards the end of the day too.
Cause at first he was like,

1077
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:59.600
Oh holy shit,
holy shit.
This thing's like,
you know,
and then just ease in,

1078
01:01:59.601 --> 01:02:03.200
just ease in and the more he spent more time you spend with that gt to such as a

1079
01:02:03.201 --> 01:02:05.840
month pretty quick.
Because before we got to the canyon,

1080
01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:10.010
I was in the passenger seat when he was driving and we did do the one full seven

1081
01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:13.670
well he's also one four seven kilometers.
No,

1082
01:02:13.671 --> 01:02:17.150
it was miles per hours was four seven who's professional driver on a closed

1083
01:02:17.151 --> 01:02:20.300
coolest,
I mean come on.
Full disclaimer here.
Matt Farah is awesome.

1084
01:02:20.301 --> 01:02:23.730
One of those guys that really loves cars.
When you're around him,

1085
01:02:23.731 --> 01:02:26.880
it's the same sort of infectious sort of vendors or flowers.
Yeah.

1086
01:02:26.881 --> 01:02:29.010
When he's driving those cars in those videos,

1087
01:02:29.011 --> 01:02:31.680
I mean that's how I became friends with him is watching his videos and then

1088
01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:33.810
reaching out to him.
Like his videos are fun.

1089
01:02:33.811 --> 01:02:36.210
Like he's enjoying driving those cars.

1090
01:02:36.211 --> 01:02:39.600
It's not like some sort of an antiseptic review of the sings.

1091
01:02:39.601 --> 01:02:44.500
He's excited about it.
Passionate.
He's got a collection of cars himself.
Delorean,

1092
01:02:46.050 --> 01:02:49.830
that's the car.
That's the car model,
right?
We punk nick three chiller.

1093
01:02:49.831 --> 01:02:54.150
I knew it was going everywhere and that Delorean,
so got a lot of style.
Exactly.

1094
01:02:54.151 --> 01:02:57.240
You know a guy that shows up in a Delorean that's,
that's a,
that's a good dude.

1095
01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:01.520
He's here to party.
Yeah,
yeah,
sure.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1096
01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:04.560
I saw one the other day in Hollywood,
so Laurie,
Matt.
Yeah.

1097
01:03:04.561 --> 01:03:07.830
I looked to see if it was Matt drive was just some weird nerd,
some guy.
I mean,

1098
01:03:07.831 --> 01:03:10.440
they're cool to drive now.
It's like you said,
a photo.

1099
01:03:10.441 --> 01:03:12.750
I run into him at the La auto show not long ago.

1100
01:03:12.751 --> 01:03:16.620
The opening day or did you stop going to be parking in the same spot underground

1101
01:03:16.621 --> 01:03:20.790
at the convention center,
but he pulled into the handicap zone.
An Impartner put.

1102
01:03:20.791 --> 01:03:21.690
He pulled into the,

1103
01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:25.350
opened up the door and I took a photo and of course I had to put it up online.

1104
01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:28.090
Of course,
within like three minutes is all this of,

1105
01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:31.780
why is that asshole parking in the handicap zone in the Delorean it,
you know,

1106
01:03:31.781 --> 01:03:34.570
it didn't take long for that to to get punchy.

1107
01:03:34.571 --> 01:03:37.130
Mentally handicapped for only a Delorean.
That's what it,

1108
01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:41.250
I think we're all challenged here and a little bit challenge ball.

1109
01:03:41.410 --> 01:03:46.230
Unempathic excited in a very illogical way.
Let's,
let's,
let's put it that way.

1110
01:03:46.231 --> 01:03:47.400
It makes sense.
It's a mouthful.

1111
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.110
So I want to get Jeremy Clarkson in one of your cars,
man.
Hey Jeremy,

1112
01:03:52.111 --> 01:03:56.070
if you're out there,
I'm sure he's listening right now.
Come on,
I'll show you.

1113
01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:59.610
He doesn't even know what the Internet is.
Seriously.
He does not.
I'm sure he's,

1114
01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:03.000
he calls it the interweb.
He's any,
any,
you know what he calls?

1115
01:04:03.030 --> 01:04:07.470
You know what he calls a Prius?
A Prius.
You know what he calls an Ipod?
Ipod.
Well,

1116
01:04:07.471 --> 01:04:11.560
you guys said it's aluminum wrong too.
No tomato color code.

1117
01:04:11.570 --> 01:04:16.530
What's up with Aloe minium belt belt?
I don't know.
It's just fell the aluminum.

1118
01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:19.560
We handle it differently over there and you just pronounce it differently.

1119
01:04:19.590 --> 01:04:22.560
Calorie spelled differently.
See?
Oh,
aw.

1120
01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:26.970
Don't want to speak English anymore then go ahead and speak Spanish.
No,

1121
01:04:26.971 --> 01:04:30.840
we're speaking American speaking to Moran.
I used speaking.
We run the world now.

1122
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:35.190
It's a different thing now.
China does he say so,
but we have all the bombs.

1123
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:37.670
Essentially.
If the shit hits the fan,
American ticks.

1124
01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:40.980
China has some bombs on this nuclear wasteland.

1125
01:04:40.981 --> 01:04:43.430
That is the world we all go to war.
Yeah.

1126
01:04:43.450 --> 01:04:46.700
It's just like Frankie goes to Hollywood,
right?
Yeah.
Go to the wall.

1127
01:04:47.290 --> 01:04:50.490
Two tribes go.
Guests can't deny American.

1128
01:04:50.491 --> 01:04:51.660
When you already moved over here and said

1129
01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:57.000
the grass is greener way of the same in American citizen,
I'll have you hollow.

1130
01:04:57.030 --> 01:05:00.090
You know how I became an American citizen?
You the only in this country.

1131
01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:04.740
How I was working way too hard mean I had a green card.
Yeah,
I,

1132
01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:09.750
I shook hands with them and we went across the border 98 all right.

1133
01:05:09.751 --> 01:05:13.980
See you man.
I'm Super Newbie.
Yeah,
no.
So I did all the process.

1134
01:05:13.981 --> 01:05:17.190
I hadn't what was known as an o one visa,
which is like a special thing.

1135
01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:18.040
Pre nine 11

1136
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:21.760
<v 3>it was kind of easy to get an la for people that were like Internet celebrities.</v>

1137
01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:25.620
Well,
Internet celebrities,
dude,
you should it.
You should've seen my groupies mad.

1138
01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:28.420
Can we go on to the shock is extreme size.
I don't know.

1139
01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:32.750
Sharkey extreme until you don't do that.
Don't do that.
Don't do that.
Yeah.

1140
01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:35.650
But when,
when you went to these things,
you know,

1141
01:05:35.651 --> 01:05:39.250
there was actually one time that I had that a woman actually showed up,

1142
01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:41.590
so it was like really cool group.
He,
one time I had a woman,

1143
01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:45.130
but most of them are guys.
Anyways,
back to that.
Yeah,
no,

1144
01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:48.930
you watched the Big Bang theory,
right?
That's sort of how I imagined.
No,

1145
01:05:48.970 --> 01:05:53.740
but when I,
when I got here at the o one visa then,
then I got a green card.

1146
01:05:54.590 --> 01:05:58.370
You know,
I got married to my girlfriend who was a game developer and um,

1147
01:05:58.950 --> 01:06:01.090
you know,
I started another company after retiring,

1148
01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:05.320
which was shark works out of a hobby again.
And uh,
you know,

1149
01:06:05.470 --> 01:06:08.590
sort of a few years into that I'm like,
okay,

1150
01:06:08.770 --> 01:06:13.450
I have to get the second green card,
which I think is three years later.
So they,

1151
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:17.830
they make the appointment and I lose the card.

1152
01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.720
Right.
You lose it the way I think,

1153
01:06:20.721 --> 01:06:24.310
the way I lose it is by bringing it back to them,
seeing how he loses,

1154
01:06:25.310 --> 01:06:29.530
at least my lunch,
good green card story when need done.
So I take it,
you know,

1155
01:06:29.531 --> 01:06:31.720
I take the green card back to them,
the original one,

1156
01:06:31.870 --> 01:06:34.540
and then I'm supposed to come back in three months and pick up the second

1157
01:06:34.541 --> 01:06:37.780
version of the green card.
I don't get,

1158
01:06:38.350 --> 01:06:41.340
I don't get to the appointment on time because you know,

1159
01:06:41.350 --> 01:06:45.610
I'm supposed to make an appointment within six to nine months and I'm so busy

1160
01:06:45.611 --> 01:06:50.110
with Shork works that I don't,
so I come there,
the officer there,
you know,

1161
01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:54.280
eventually is like,
hmm,
well we're never going to find it.

1162
01:06:54.490 --> 01:06:56.440
I mean you're here like a year late,

1163
01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:02.200
so you could either start this process again or do you want to just become an

1164
01:07:02.201 --> 01:07:05.980
American citizen?
Literally.
I'm not kidding you.
And I was like,
okay,

1165
01:07:05.981 --> 01:07:08.680
test right there on that.
So I did like,
uh,
no,
not,
not in the spot.

1166
01:07:08.681 --> 01:07:10.180
I had to come back and do a history test.

1167
01:07:10.450 --> 01:07:14.950
And at the time he talk about the Mustang.
No.
Oh No,
no,
no.

1168
01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:19.540
That's it.
What was this?
This uh,
John Adams thing was on HBO.
Fucking useful.

1169
01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:23.080
Sam Adam's brother.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That's,
that's the last,

1170
01:07:23.081 --> 01:07:27.260
the one that's [inaudible] stories,
right?
Yeah,
man.
Yeah,
no mom,

1171
01:07:28.750 --> 01:07:30.130
I picked up on that and then,
you know,

1172
01:07:30.131 --> 01:07:32.770
my education finally came in handy because,
you know,
we did,

1173
01:07:32.890 --> 01:07:35.220
we did a lot of history and stuff and actually,
you know,

1174
01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:38.110
the Brits did kind of ruled the,
pretend you're ruled the waves back then,

1175
01:07:38.111 --> 01:07:42.850
you know,
we call nice everything including the wing of a Gett.
Um,

1176
01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:46.820
but yeah,
so that's how,
that's how I got it.
And so I filled out,

1177
01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:49.240
it's not cool to come in for a visa and they said,
look,

1178
01:07:49.241 --> 01:07:52.600
just because some believable,
just become a fucking citizen.
You speak English,

1179
01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:56.530
you look kind of weird.
You have never said that to me.

1180
01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:59.800
It's a really my green card story.
I'll make it really short.

1181
01:07:59.801 --> 01:08:02.380
You know I'm on a green card.
I've been here 28 years.

1182
01:08:02.381 --> 01:08:06.940
Recent couple of years back,
I go to England,
leave,
leave La,

1183
01:08:06.941 --> 01:08:08.980
no problem getting into England,
no problem.

1184
01:08:08.981 --> 01:08:11.710
10 days later I'm ready to go back to La and they go,
okay,

1185
01:08:11.711 --> 01:08:14.500
we need to see a green card.
I even looked at it and about two years,

1186
01:08:14.501 --> 01:08:16.340
well tuned out,
it had expired.

1187
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:18.320
<v 2>Oh yeah.
What's the big deal?</v>

1188
01:08:18.321 --> 01:08:23.120
It's sorta like it expired two weeks before you not homeland security's Klein on

1189
01:08:23.121 --> 01:08:26.000
a suspended grandfather.
Karen's all upset because we were like,

1190
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:27.410
how long is this going to take your work?

1191
01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:30.470
You may have to stay or a week or two and go to the embassy and blah,
blah,
blah.

1192
01:08:30.770 --> 01:08:31.820
Anyway,
long story short,

1193
01:08:31.821 --> 01:08:35.360
we got a 24 hour extension just to fly back into the states.

1194
01:08:35.750 --> 01:08:39.350
Got Sorta hammered when I came into lax because of course they thought this was

1195
01:08:39.351 --> 01:08:42.980
some Mickey mouse 24 hour extension.
But long story short,

1196
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:48.550
don't let your green card expire in 2015 it's really hard to become a US

1197
01:08:49.761 --> 01:08:50.594
citizen.
Right?

1198
01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:55.680
It's a much harder for a white English guy that has or had a posh English

1199
01:08:56.181 --> 01:09:00.590
accent.
It's probably not as hard as it is for people of other ethnicities.

1200
01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:04.520
I mean for a guy with a northern accent and I'm talking with a different skin

1201
01:09:04.521 --> 01:09:08.790
color,
a turbine,
you know,
if you're all white that,

1202
01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:11.250
have you heard about the turban outlaw thing?
We're doing the Turpin,

1203
01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:14.000
our urban outlaw terminology,
Chub,
Chub,
little ritual.

1204
01:09:14.010 --> 01:09:18.980
Boy Turban doesn't start in a corner shop.
Does it?

1205
01:09:19.630 --> 01:09:21.520
The band corner shop?
No,
it does not start.

1206
01:09:21.630 --> 01:09:25.700
And have you ever thought about doing something like with singers doing but

1207
01:09:25.701 --> 01:09:30.530
doing it with like the,
the actual classic shape nine nine you know,

1208
01:09:30.531 --> 01:09:35.531
1970s night late 1960s car and like producing them bill?

1209
01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:39.440
No.
You know,
I think I touched on that earlier on about I don't build customer.

1210
01:09:39.490 --> 01:09:40.161
I know you don't,

1211
01:09:40.161 --> 01:09:44.120
but coming down what a demand there would be demand there for sure.
But you know,

1212
01:09:44.210 --> 01:09:48.950
then it goes for me from being a hobby and a passion to a job in a business

1213
01:09:48.951 --> 01:09:51.070
which means responsibilities.

1214
01:09:51.071 --> 01:09:54.860
He's like if you come to me and say hey I love you kaba his all of a sudden it's

1215
01:09:54.861 --> 01:09:57.530
not my car,
it's your interpretation of my car.

1216
01:09:57.530 --> 01:09:59.300
It might have some tweet on it and you know,

1217
01:09:59.310 --> 01:10:04.040
might be pumped up and you know it's all of a sudden it's got your personality,

1218
01:10:04.041 --> 01:10:04.970
which is fine.

1219
01:10:05.210 --> 01:10:09.290
But then I'm sort of under the pressure I believe to make your happy to build

1220
01:10:09.291 --> 01:10:12.380
the car to your expectations,
your timeline,
your deadline.

1221
01:10:12.381 --> 01:10:17.000
So I don't really have any interest in turning that side over to becoming like a

1222
01:10:17.001 --> 01:10:17.870
production line.

1223
01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:21.230
Even though I know if I built let's say three or five cars a year,

1224
01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:25.140
I could probably sell them cause I've had no problem selling college.
You know,

1225
01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:28.160
through the press.
I've got people,
I get all these emails.

1226
01:10:28.161 --> 01:10:30.680
If you ever want to sell that call,
let me know type of thing.

1227
01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:33.550
It's interesting though with so many collectors out there,

1228
01:10:33.570 --> 01:10:35.890
so many people who customize cars and do the,

1229
01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:41.080
you've sort of somehow or another just by just your own infectious passion,

1230
01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:44.450
enthusiasm,
you've risen to the top.

1231
01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:47.480
You probably short about the long hair and the beard.
I think,
you know,

1232
01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:51.350
it's a little bit of that,
that stuff anyway,
I don't know,
time phony.

1233
01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:54.990
I think it was luck and timing,
you know,
um,

1234
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:59.840
last year was the 50th anniversary of the nine 11 so you could not escape

1235
01:10:59.870 --> 01:11:04.130
hearing about Porsche in the nine 11 50th anniversary issues.

1236
01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:06.500
And I think from a story point of view,

1237
01:11:06.710 --> 01:11:09.200
the builds that I would doing were quite interesting.

1238
01:11:09.201 --> 01:11:12.170
But I also think not being your typical Porsche looking guy,

1239
01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:17.190
because truth be told there is a stereotype,
especially in la of doctor,

1240
01:11:17.191 --> 01:11:21.750
lawyer,
Beverly Hills guy driving around,
never taken his car to the canyons,

1241
01:11:21.751 --> 01:11:25.980
you know,
just more of a status symbol.
So I was a complete opposite of that.

1242
01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:28.020
So I think from a story point of view,

1243
01:11:28.021 --> 01:11:31.860
why I got a lot of sort of momentum was couple of things.
Timing,

1244
01:11:31.861 --> 01:11:33.780
not looking like a typical Porsche guy.

1245
01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:38.340
And also the cars that I build instantly recognizable is nine 11 but just

1246
01:11:38.610 --> 01:11:41.520
slightly tweaked.
You know,
I said little details,

1247
01:11:41.550 --> 01:11:46.080
I think separate my beliefs from the countless other people building cars and

1248
01:11:46.081 --> 01:11:48.150
the one common thread between the fashion,

1249
01:11:48.151 --> 01:11:52.440
the clothing and the property and the filming that we do is just put in our own

1250
01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:57.030
little style on it,
which became personality.
And for me,
I never set out to say,

1251
01:11:57.031 --> 01:12:01.230
okay,
here's the 1973 RSR that left the factory,

1252
01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:03.840
the Porsche factory in everyone that replicates that car,

1253
01:12:04.050 --> 01:12:05.820
just duplicate exactly what the factory,

1254
01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:09.210
<v 3>what I want to make this point too,
because a lot of people are gonna ask me,</v>

1255
01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:10.830
how did this happen?
And you know,

1256
01:12:11.490 --> 01:12:14.970
he hasn't made a single cent from like what happened is,
you know,

1257
01:12:14.971 --> 01:12:19.040
we sat down by the fireplace how money and had a baby,
you know,

1258
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:22.430
which is a gt to outlaw Gtt when you two together.
Yeah.

1259
01:12:22.890 --> 01:12:25.480
I wasn't sure what it was throwing them out of there either actually.
Oh,

1260
01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:29.660
just check your rear end later.
Um,
for coal,

1261
01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:34.320
coal miner's daughter Co oh Jeez,
that's a good film.
Was going downhill,

1262
01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:36.880
is gone down.
No,
but there wasn't a sent me,

1263
01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:40.410
actually the only thing he's gotten out of getting out of me was,
uh,
uh,

1264
01:12:40.411 --> 01:12:43.140
one 18th a scale white Gtt,

1265
01:12:43.141 --> 01:12:45.450
which I just happened to send him the day I got the car.

1266
01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:50.100
And the funny story is that,
um,
Dan who was here last time,
um,

1267
01:12:50.730 --> 01:12:54.600
him and I,
the first day we got that Jeetu we're like,
well,

1268
01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:58.860
it's not as pretty as the a or flashy or crazy as that blue and orange car.

1269
01:12:59.310 --> 01:13:00.143
What the hell,

1270
01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:05.160
what we need to do is make a sketch of his two 77 car.
So we,
you know,

1271
01:13:05.161 --> 01:13:08.810
we used Photoshop or he did because I suck at it.
And um,

1272
01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.150
he did like a five minute job of a,
uh,

1273
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:15.510
of attribute car to the two 77 and emailed it to him and you know,

1274
01:13:15.690 --> 01:13:19.410
I texted him and he's like,
how's the horsepower coming?
You know,

1275
01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:22.050
basically that's just English subtle way of saying,
you know,
don't,

1276
01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:25.090
don't quit your day job,
start making calls,
go fast.

1277
01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:29.400
And perhaps the moral to that story.
And I sorta kept needling,

1278
01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:33.270
needling and needling and he had to live with it.
And you know,
he just,

1279
01:13:33.271 --> 01:13:35.630
I don't know.
Right.
Cause he got passionate about the car.
So he did.

1280
01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:38.650
<v 2>Listening evolved organically.
I think I touched on in the past,</v>

1281
01:13:38.651 --> 01:13:41.530
people have asked me to collaborate on,
you know,

1282
01:13:41.710 --> 01:13:45.790
some of the people's builds and for me I had to be connected to the car,

1283
01:13:46.090 --> 01:13:46.923
you know,
uh,

1284
01:13:47.570 --> 01:13:52.220
and I think when they left the car with me for as long as I wanted really raise

1285
01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:54.610
only one time for a long time in la,

1286
01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:58.360
but I finally connected with the car and then it just made sense to put my

1287
01:13:58.361 --> 01:14:01.450
personality on that carcass.
For me,
this is not about money.

1288
01:14:01.451 --> 01:14:05.980
I'm not making money off this collaboration.
It was just a fun project that,
wow,

1289
01:14:05.981 --> 01:14:09.990
this is great.
I've got this awesome car that I can keep for a little bit.
Handsy,

1290
01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:14.740
Opp,
other portraits,
baby,
you can do whatever I want to do.

1291
01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:16.450
And I,
you know,
it was just,
for me,

1292
01:14:16.451 --> 01:14:20.710
it was really exciting to put my sort of interpretation on a new car.
You know,

1293
01:14:20.711 --> 01:14:25.270
I'm sort of moving forward in the Porsche years often talk about variety and

1294
01:14:25.271 --> 01:14:29.680
wanting to experience more of what Porsche has got to offer.
So for me,

1295
01:14:29.681 --> 01:14:33.970
my original goal was having one of each year from 64 through 73 which covered

1296
01:14:34.330 --> 01:14:36.280
short wheelbase and long wheelbase cars.

1297
01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:41.310
Now you need one from 2007 my new goal now is to have one of every generation.

1298
01:14:42.041 --> 01:14:44.230
There's seven generations,
of course,
you know,

1299
01:14:44.231 --> 01:14:49.231
through the g series align to the nine nine s nine nine (396) 499-6997,

1300
01:14:50.921 --> 01:14:51.790
nine,
nine one.

1301
01:14:52.090 --> 01:14:55.780
So I want to experience everything that Porsche has to offer in the nine 11

1302
01:14:55.781 --> 01:14:59.890
range.
So far I've covered sort of,
I've driven all those calls,

1303
01:14:59.891 --> 01:15:02.880
but I've never owned them.
Well,
let me ask you about this then.
You,
you,

1304
01:15:02.890 --> 01:15:04.870
you really love those old cars.

1305
01:15:04.871 --> 01:15:08.380
And one of the things you love about those old cars is the tactile field.

1306
01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:12.400
When you know you're dealing with a car that weighs 2000 plus pounds and such a

1307
01:15:12.401 --> 01:15:16.490
light car,
you feel the road,
no installation,
no power steering you,

1308
01:15:16.530 --> 01:15:19.090
you literally feel the pebbles that you're driving over.

1309
01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:20.590
When you get to like nine nine,

1310
01:15:20.591 --> 01:15:25.000
six and nine nine seven you're going to get like a more muted feel [inaudible]

1311
01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:29.710
experience compared to the hill you get to the gt three and the gt three sorta

1312
01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:31.480
removes some of that insulation,

1313
01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:36.420
<v 3>better car to do it on then a car that you only produce 200 nobody understands.</v>

1314
01:15:36.450 --> 01:15:40.730
When you say new car,
it is a newer era car,
but it's actually a 2008 car.
We,

1315
01:15:40.731 --> 01:15:44.410
you're talking about your car that yeah,
the Gt to put it this way,
right?

1316
01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:49.230
Walter Raul,
we,
we,
you know,
he's the world's greatest brow x rally drive Easter,

1317
01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:53.410
right?
You know,
drive group B rally cars that were like death traps.
And when,

1318
01:15:53.770 --> 01:15:55.900
um,
you know,
he did,
you know,

1319
01:15:55.930 --> 01:16:00.930
mid seven minutes in a Carrera gt and the exact same time in a stock version of

1320
01:16:01.181 --> 01:16:03.720
that gt two.
So the gt

1321
01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:07.780
<v 2>to these guys have got Scott 200 horse power more than the career GT and British</v>

1322
01:16:07.781 --> 01:16:12.040
flags on it.
Easy a car to drive.
But is it an,
is it unmanageable?

1323
01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:13.340
I mean when you get to that kind of power,

1324
01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:17.950
<v 3>the way he drives it actually he manages you wear,
you wear it well.</v>

1325
01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:22.250
<v 2>Is there a point of diminishing returns?</v>

1326
01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:26.120
We have too much power in a car and you're spending so much time trying to

1327
01:16:26.121 --> 01:16:28.460
figure out,
trying to not kill yourself down.
Yeah,

1328
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.650
you obviously don't need 775 will say too much power is never enough.

1329
01:16:34.730 --> 01:16:38.870
I'm the lessees mall type of guy,
but I got to say horsepower is addictive.

1330
01:16:38.871 --> 01:16:39.470
You know,

1331
01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:42.650
I had that mopar background driving the superbeets and those things were

1332
01:16:42.651 --> 01:16:45.140
addictive in a straight line.
The GT two,

1333
01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:48.530
there's no question that's a scary car and it's got 775 horsepower.

1334
01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:53.060
But that's sort of part of the challenge of can you man up and sort of conquer

1335
01:16:53.061 --> 01:16:56.540
that power.
You know?
And that's one of those things that unless you,
you know,

1336
01:16:56.750 --> 01:17:01.280
I've got,
you want to speak really talented,
I think he got to grow into that.

1337
01:17:01.281 --> 01:17:05.180
So to me that's the challenge of trying to get the most out of that car.

1338
01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:05.811
You know,

1339
01:17:05.811 --> 01:17:10.550
and I've sort of been lucky through these guys to belt drive various variations

1340
01:17:10.551 --> 01:17:13.490
of the gt three.
You know I've driven in stock form,

1341
01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:17.720
I've driven the three nine have driven the full point and I've driven that gt

1342
01:17:17.721 --> 01:17:22.080
two this year I got to drive a lot of my dream cars and nine 11 or uh,

1343
01:17:22.110 --> 01:17:27.110
drove us 74 hour saw but I drove three of Porsche's iconic super hyper cars and

1344
01:17:27.741 --> 01:17:32.660
I'm five,
nine the Carrera gt and the nine 18 and they all offer,

1345
01:17:33.290 --> 01:17:36.260
I keep going back to variety cause they all do the same thing differently.

1346
01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:38.690
And that's sort of what's great about the gt two.

1347
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:43.260
It does the same thing but it just delivers it in a different form engine.

1348
01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:47.600
You know on the challenge there is truth be told that car is done by 7,000 rpm.

1349
01:17:47.601 --> 01:17:51.800
You're on the limit or you're bouncing off the limit or 6,800 rpm and he's done

1350
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:54.980
step into two 77 that's got a quarter of the horsepower.

1351
01:17:55.010 --> 01:17:58.280
That thing will rev or over 8,000 step into the GT.

1352
01:17:58.281 --> 01:18:02.710
Three 3.9 or 4.1 those things go to,
well 86 88 and nine

1353
01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:04.930
<v 5>kind of just talking about numbers here,</v>

1354
01:18:04.931 --> 01:18:08.530
but what my point is is like there's two different schools of thought in two

1355
01:18:08.531 --> 01:18:10.150
different philosophies that you're dealing with.

1356
01:18:10.330 --> 01:18:15.040
You're dealing with in one school of thought,
the cars that you are famous for,

1357
01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:19.030
which are these really lightweight cars that are very tactile and there's some

1358
01:18:19.031 --> 01:18:21.100
sort of a strange character to those cars.

1359
01:18:21.101 --> 01:18:23.350
Like even when solid urban outlaw video,

1360
01:18:23.351 --> 01:18:25.870
when you get into that silver car and you rev it and you're,

1361
01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:27.280
you're looking at the gauges,

1362
01:18:27.281 --> 01:18:30.400
it has a feel to it that you just do not get from a modern,

1363
01:18:30.650 --> 01:18:33.670
<v 2>well,
there is a,
there is,
I mean you've admitted this to,</v>

1364
01:18:33.850 --> 01:18:38.850
there is like some level of connection between visit Dnas that still there

1365
01:18:39.370 --> 01:18:41.050
unquestionably.
You know,
it's a little heavier.

1366
01:18:41.051 --> 01:18:43.990
It's a little more margin out of the cup holder,
but it's still got that.

1367
01:18:44.230 --> 01:18:48.850
That's why I said the golden era before 2007 to 2011 those gt cars,

1368
01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:51.040
they have their old manual,

1369
01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:55.100
they still have that link to the real nine 11 I,

1370
01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:57.940
that's why that car has gone up in value so much.

1371
01:18:57.970 --> 01:19:02.230
You know all the gt cars because people that know and there aren't many of them

1372
01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:03.970
unfortunately,
and that liked to drive.

1373
01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:07.690
They get it and they've had all the cars or they want older cars,
you know,

1374
01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:11.080
or the parents have had older cars and they drive these new ones and it's like,

1375
01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:12.430
you know what?
It's okay.

1376
01:19:12.431 --> 01:19:15.700
It does all that stuff a little more comfortably and has nav and all that Shit,

1377
01:19:16.030 --> 01:19:19.600
but it's still a nine 11 I think the gt three up to what you've got,

1378
01:19:19.601 --> 01:19:24.190
the nine nine seven is the connection to what I've got from the sixties and

1379
01:19:24.190 --> 01:19:28.390
seventies yours.
It's like a baby gt.
Three cars,
sat,
throttle response,

1380
01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:33.640
the light nurse,
the way it feels,
the road,
the weight turns in his back to that.

1381
01:19:33.641 --> 01:19:37.270
I keep talking about it,
the five senses,
the connection,
the sight,
the sound,

1382
01:19:37.271 --> 01:19:41.130
the feel,
the smell,
the gt three has that,
you know,
uh,

1383
01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:43.720
and that's what's great about those because I've yet to all one,

1384
01:19:43.721 --> 01:19:45.820
I'm trying to get a nine,
nine six gt three.

1385
01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:49.270
So I think that's the most bang for the buck.
I mean,
truth be told,

1386
01:19:49.271 --> 01:19:53.050
I've been collecting these early nine 11th for over 20 years when you could find

1387
01:19:53.051 --> 01:19:53.831
them in crate,
you know,

1388
01:19:53.831 --> 01:19:58.831
auto trader and I bought two 77 at the Pomona swap me in 1999 and it just,

1389
01:20:00.031 --> 01:20:04.570
it's a second pusher I ever owned and it's evolved into us become,
I think my,

1390
01:20:04.810 --> 01:20:08.520
the car that I'm most connected with in all my memorable moments in everything

1391
01:20:08.521 --> 01:20:12.590
you talk about that tactile feel and the connection and sort of what I think to

1392
01:20:12.591 --> 01:20:14.010
me it got across in urban outlaw.

1393
01:20:14.010 --> 01:20:17.160
The documentary is so common thread that everyone relates to,

1394
01:20:17.161 --> 01:20:21.240
you've always got your favorite car that you go back to an I described that

1395
01:20:21.241 --> 01:20:25.440
being like my old favorite pair of beat up jeans or your old shoes because you

1396
01:20:25.441 --> 01:20:28.770
just comfortable in it.
There's no surprises.
And it's funny,

1397
01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:32.100
you know you spoke highly about Matt Raven about the car.
You know,

1398
01:20:32.101 --> 01:20:36.360
he got comfortable in that car within half a mile where you know,

1399
01:20:36.361 --> 01:20:40.470
he was pushing that car.
So the limits are not that high where yeah,

1400
01:20:40.471 --> 01:20:45.140
the car is fast but it's not gt too fast where you know you're not going to get

1401
01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:48.420
way over your head really quickly.
I think that's the difference.

1402
01:20:48.421 --> 01:20:52.680
And that to me is the challenge of driving these early causes.
Yeah,

1403
01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:54.510
they're antiquated by today's standards,

1404
01:20:54.511 --> 01:20:59.070
but it's every time you get an I talk about driving for me is freedom because I

1405
01:20:59.071 --> 01:21:02.880
don't come you,
I walk to work.
So 80% of our drivers are pure pleasure.

1406
01:21:03.150 --> 01:21:06.030
It's like you're working out in the gym.
No two experiences are the same,

1407
01:21:06.031 --> 01:21:10.080
I don't think.
But these are rewarding satisfaction.
I assume.
I don't work out.

1408
01:21:10.081 --> 01:21:14.430
But to me,
I often say people,
like some people like to go to gyms to work out.

1409
01:21:14.610 --> 01:21:16.080
I like to get in the car and drive.

1410
01:21:16.081 --> 01:21:21.081
That's my physical and mental workout is behind the seat of that car because

1411
01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:23.040
nothing else matters when the,

1412
01:21:23.041 --> 01:21:26.550
either you're not thinking about what you might be pissed off about or you know,

1413
01:21:26.551 --> 01:21:29.340
something that's sort of bugging you want to get behind that wheel.

1414
01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:34.740
It is the sort of almost out of battery sensory type of expression of man and

1415
01:21:34.741 --> 01:21:36.740
machine on the Oprah with those simplest

1416
01:21:37.010 --> 01:21:39.560
<v 5>lightweight cars.
That's where you're getting this experience.</v>

1417
01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:42.620
And I think that's one of the things that people miss when they talk,
oh,

1418
01:21:42.621 --> 01:21:46.700
I don't care about cars.
Cars get me there,
or everybody gets wrapped up in cars.

1419
01:21:46.850 --> 01:21:50.450
I think what they're dealing with is the difference between like a modern

1420
01:21:50.451 --> 01:21:55.160
commuting car and what you're driving,
which is essentially like a ride.
You're,

1421
01:21:55.190 --> 01:21:56.030
you're in a ride.

1422
01:21:56.130 --> 01:21:59.540
<v 3>You know what I said is it's sort of like,
I like surfing.</v>

1423
01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:01.970
I've had seven concussions so I can't do it anymore.

1424
01:22:02.330 --> 01:22:04.250
But You got a concussion from surfing.

1425
01:22:04.340 --> 01:22:08.390
I got one from surfing and six from soccer.
Football.
Oh,
and sorry.

1426
01:22:08.391 --> 01:22:11.900
One from being a passenger in a car.
One time us from Ralph,
right.

1427
01:22:12.830 --> 01:22:17.300
He was semi pro football back in the day.
No,
no,
just,
just,

1428
01:22:17.330 --> 01:22:20.310
just basically this,
just call it public schoolboy footballer.

1429
01:22:20.330 --> 01:22:22.670
Then how about that?
Okay.
That sounds sexier.

1430
01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:26.420
So David Beckham shouldn't be worried about you.
Oh,
no,
no.
I was too left.

1431
01:22:26.450 --> 01:22:31.310
I was too lazy.
No,
no,
no.
I alright with the,
no,

1432
01:22:31.370 --> 01:22:33.170
I was left footed.
But um,
yeah,

1433
01:22:33.171 --> 01:22:36.560
it's sort of like surfing where it's not for everybody.
It's,

1434
01:22:36.710 --> 01:22:39.500
it doesn't make sense.
I mean,
in northern California,
you go out,

1435
01:22:39.710 --> 01:22:43.640
it's 50 degrees in the water.
There are some sharks actually.
Um,

1436
01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:46.460
and it's gnarly and the surfers are not friendly at all.

1437
01:22:46.461 --> 01:22:49.880
They're very localized and they hate you and you can't open your mouth if you

1438
01:22:49.881 --> 01:22:54.080
don't live there.
I just watched that film,
like,
it's like that surfers,
man.

1439
01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:58.520
Let me tell you,
Santa Cruz,
there's where I go.
You know,

1440
01:22:58.521 --> 01:23:01.760
it's not the friendly city.
I mean you would think they're all,
you know,

1441
01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:06.160
lit all the time and everything,
but they're not friendly.
It's like,
no,

1442
01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:08.920
<v 4>this is my way fest and get the fuck out of the way.</v>

1443
01:23:08.930 --> 01:23:12.350
Fest Keith was stolen movie this settler

1444
01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:19.720
lost boys.
Oh,
lost boys.
Yeah.
That's cool.
Santa Cruz,
Santa Cruz.
Right.

1445
01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:24.790
I don't really know.
I don't know.
Location was like a main point.

1446
01:23:24.791 --> 01:23:27.700
And then I think it was the vampires.
Vampires what the big deal.

1447
01:23:27.701 --> 01:23:31.750
You missed the point dude.
Missed the point.
But go ahead.
Right.

1448
01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:32.790
I know when I go surf,

1449
01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:34.750
<v 3>I mean there's better ways.</v>

1450
01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:39.330
There's better things to do with your time that are less risky probably.
Um,

1451
01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:40.930
cause it is kind of risky to do that.

1452
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:46.590
So driving a crazy weird lower production car that's doesn't make a lot of

1453
01:23:47.201 --> 01:23:51.010
sense.
It's challenging.
But then,
you know,
why do people,
you know,

1454
01:23:51.550 --> 01:23:53.740
I mean not to make it sound glamorous,
but you know,

1455
01:23:53.741 --> 01:23:56.680
why do people bungee jump or why did they,
you know,

1456
01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:01.210
I want to do something that's sort of challenging and takes time and it's

1457
01:24:01.211 --> 01:24:04.780
rewarding.
You know,
you get one out of 10 shifts.
Correct.
Or you know,

1458
01:24:05.570 --> 01:24:10.090
the senses,
it's a sensory studies chat.
It's a challenge.
Right.
I mean,

1459
01:24:10.330 --> 01:24:14.080
you know,
like with your MMA stuff,
I mean you probably started as a white belt,

1460
01:24:14.081 --> 01:24:15.790
you know,
back in nine,
everybody does.
Right.

1461
01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:17.460
<v 4>But let's really start,
right?
Yeah.</v>

1462
01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:22.110
Well exactly.
But it takes

1463
01:24:22.330 --> 01:24:25.280
<v 3>time and it's challenging and you know,
you beat up your body and,</v>

1464
01:24:25.510 --> 01:24:27.850
and it feels good when you get there.
So,
you know,

1465
01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:31.800
the blue car beat the shit out of us in terms of the development,
the costs,
the,

1466
01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:36.510
the setbacks,
the,
you know,
it didn't make any sense to do that.
You know,

1467
01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:39.580
it should have just focused on something that,
you know,
it was a high volume,

1468
01:24:39.581 --> 01:24:41.940
high production car,
like,
uh,
I dunno,

1469
01:24:41.950 --> 01:24:45.700
like a Prius and made it get better gas mileage,
you know,
then,
then I'd be,

1470
01:24:46.330 --> 01:24:49.000
you know,
driving the world's most pimped out Prius probably.

1471
01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:52.360
But that's not what I wanted to do.
I want to do something that's,
you know,

1472
01:24:52.361 --> 01:24:55.320
feels good and it's challenging and you know,
work with these kids,

1473
01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:57.460
you're surrounded by Weirdos like him.

1474
01:24:57.650 --> 01:25:00.100
<v 4>That's what I should go a long way.
You know,
I'm for me,</v>

1475
01:25:00.101 --> 01:25:02.120
you know the best things in life and never really

1476
01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:05.290
<v 3>literally like I said the,
Oh okay.
There is one thing he's getting out of it.</v>

1477
01:25:05.650 --> 01:25:09.220
Okay.
So other than the one 18th scale model,
I said,
dude,

1478
01:25:09.221 --> 01:25:12.190
I can not look at your smashed iPhone five anymore.
You're really,

1479
01:25:12.191 --> 01:25:15.740
really good at all these pictures and everything.
I'm buying you an iPhone six

1480
01:25:15.970 --> 01:25:20.100
<v 4>I'm helping you.
Awkward.
That's what he's getting.
So I got kicked out.</v>

1481
01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:24.260
I resisted,
resisted,
resisted up until 18 months ago.

1482
01:25:24.261 --> 01:25:26.480
I was still Motorola flip razor phone.

1483
01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:29.500
And that to me was cool cause everyone's here,
whether iPhone,

1484
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:32.570
giving it this side on the other.
I'm like,
what the fuck is that about?

1485
01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:35.780
And then finally my Motorola Razor had died.
I literally,

1486
01:25:35.781 --> 01:25:40.781
I had no choice other than a real sort of throw away crap burner phone or pause.

1487
01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:45.170
The only have three buttons,
something like that.
Yeah,
exactly.
It was that,

1488
01:25:45.171 --> 01:25:46.970
oh an iPhone five.
So I got the iPhone.

1489
01:25:47.010 --> 01:25:50.480
I remember I got it before Amelia island last year.
So that Amelia island,

1490
01:25:50.481 --> 01:25:51.380
nothing is march,

1491
01:25:51.381 --> 01:25:56.120
so barely out the iPhone two years and that sort of how my life's changed in two

1492
01:25:56.121 --> 01:26:00.440
years was never on Facebook,
wasn't on Instagram.
Still.
He's still on Twitter.

1493
01:26:00.441 --> 01:26:04.230
It's little.
I'm trying to set him up with that.
It's you gotten

1494
01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:07.850
<v 5>Magnus Walker probably going to go,
you know what we can do,
we can do,</v>

1495
01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:11.650
we can do sharpness walker.
He goes,
what?
We can shock a shark despite this.

1496
01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:16.070
Wilken nine 11 my friend Ari went back to the flip phone.
He goes,
no,

1497
01:26:16.071 --> 01:26:17.810
Ari Shaffir standup comedian.

1498
01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:22.130
He went back to the in his iPhone and went to a flip phone,
went off the days,

1499
01:26:22.131 --> 01:26:25.310
all of his social media stuff,
either on a computer or not.

1500
01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:28.340
He doesn't check his Twitter on his phone.
His,
he's like,

1501
01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:30.220
I was getting too wrapped up in like,

1502
01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:32.170
I would be talking to someone and I to this guy.

1503
01:26:32.210 --> 01:26:37.210
I wonder if anybody sleep last night on like literally my iPhone hit my forehead

1504
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.920
three times and I finally gave up because I was like,

1505
01:26:39.921 --> 01:26:43.250
what the fuck am I going to post another concussion?
You know,
I'm like,

1506
01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:46.130
I'm looking at,
I don't think it's spelled correctly and it's probably like,

1507
01:26:46.131 --> 01:26:46.311
you know,

1508
01:26:46.311 --> 01:26:50.480
a bunch of weird wingding character brings me back to what I was gonna say is

1509
01:26:50.481 --> 01:26:53.300
like there's,
there's,
there's,
there's,

1510
01:26:53.450 --> 01:26:56.180
there's something about iPhones that drag people in,
right?

1511
01:26:56.180 --> 01:26:59.950
There's something about like being able to look at videos and you're,

1512
01:26:59.951 --> 01:27:01.470
you're interacting with your phone.
Yeah.

1513
01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:05.630
The interaction that you get with those old cars,
the field that you get,

1514
01:27:05.631 --> 01:27:09.290
the addiction that you get to get in those things is very different than the new

1515
01:27:09.291 --> 01:27:13.010
cars and is there,
and I wanted to ask you this because you're the expert on it.

1516
01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:13.873
Those older cars,

1517
01:27:14.210 --> 01:27:18.650
they're like a point where it crosses this line and it's not the same experience

1518
01:27:18.651 --> 01:27:23.180
anymore.
And was there like a sweet spot in the production of cars?
Where's,

1519
01:27:23.210 --> 01:27:27.800
where there a spot where all the technological advances and all the advances is

1520
01:27:27.801 --> 01:27:28.634
suspension.

1521
01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:32.090
Although they may allow you to get around a racetrack a little bit quicker,

1522
01:27:32.091 --> 01:27:36.020
especially with like PDK transmissions with dual clutch is working at the same

1523
01:27:36.021 --> 01:27:40.130
time.
They do allow you to get places faster.
But is it,

1524
01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:45.110
is it missing all the stuff that gets people excited about cars?
I mean,

1525
01:27:45.111 --> 01:27:49.250
cause I know that driving an automatic car is fun.

1526
01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:50.450
It is satisfying.

1527
01:27:50.451 --> 01:27:55.451
But I also know it's not as satisfying as shifting your own gears as the field

1528
01:27:55.881 --> 01:27:57.740
that you're going to get from a car like yours.

1529
01:27:57.741 --> 01:27:59.840
And I think that that's something that's missing.

1530
01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:05.120
<v 2>I think ultimately moving forward the manual may become a lost art because you</v>

1531
01:28:06.091 --> 01:28:09.500
look at kids growing up today that don't know how to drive manual cars.

1532
01:28:09.501 --> 01:28:12.810
So the point of reference is completely different.
You know,
I,

1533
01:28:13.170 --> 01:28:17.190
most of us here I think learn driving a manual car and everything he said is

1534
01:28:17.191 --> 01:28:21.120
perfectly true.
That ac interaction between man and machine,

1535
01:28:21.450 --> 01:28:25.860
which gets you down the road differently in a manual than what it does in a new

1536
01:28:25.861 --> 01:28:28.710
car and a PD care automatic and uh,

1537
01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:32.100
asked to try to nail down a real answer to what is that sweet spot.

1538
01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:35.070
I don't really know what the answer is to that question.
You know,

1539
01:28:35.071 --> 01:28:38.250
I've driven almost every Porsche are out there and you know,

1540
01:28:38.251 --> 01:28:42.300
I've driven the new turbos.
I,
I've driven the new,
uh,
came in,

1541
01:28:42.301 --> 01:28:44.340
which is a phenomenal car.
I've driven than nine,

1542
01:28:44.341 --> 01:28:49.341
nine one in manual and PDK and the new manuals and not the same as your manuals.

1543
01:28:49.890 --> 01:28:53.670
You know,
they've got,
this is hot to heel and toe.
The way the pedals are set up,

1544
01:28:53.671 --> 01:28:57.360
especially if you've got ceramic breaks where he spleen heel toe to people don't

1545
01:28:57.361 --> 01:28:59.580
know what the fuck you're talking about is sort of another thing when a

1546
01:28:59.581 --> 01:29:00.720
downshift and you know,

1547
01:29:00.721 --> 01:29:04.350
you want to be basically on the brake and Britain the throttle at the same time

1548
01:29:04.351 --> 01:29:08.640
doing it with one foot.
So covering two pedals with one foot and the early cars,

1549
01:29:08.641 --> 01:29:12.540
it's really easy to sort of modulate the brake and the gas pedal.
You know,

1550
01:29:12.541 --> 01:29:16.710
I'm often put little blocks of wood on the gas pedal to bring it further up.

1551
01:29:16.711 --> 01:29:19.880
So when you're all the way down on the brake,
you can just sort of squeeze it,

1552
01:29:19.881 --> 01:29:24.390
break with your right toe and roll over to the throttle to blip it.

1553
01:29:24.391 --> 01:29:28.620
So you matching the engine rest when you downshifting that essentially as water

1554
01:29:28.621 --> 01:29:32.190
for the heel and toe aids,
you know it's a smoother transition between the gears.

1555
01:29:32.530 --> 01:29:36.990
So as you're shifting gears,
you're revving the engine at the same time to match.

1556
01:29:36.991 --> 01:29:40.990
You know when you're going to do the lightweight flywheel that allows the,
the,

1557
01:29:40.991 --> 01:29:43.170
the wrap.
Some of the early college don't have that.

1558
01:29:43.171 --> 01:29:46.230
But what these guys are doing is super throttle responsive,
lightweight,

1559
01:29:46.450 --> 01:29:49.390
flywheels like hey components.
It just makes it like you know,

1560
01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:53.010
and a new one you'll nine nine one it's a little bit different cause you got

1561
01:29:53.011 --> 01:29:55.410
those ceramic breaks of travel on the brake pedal.

1562
01:29:55.411 --> 01:29:58.950
Let's say you're coming down to these crest highway in fourth gear.

1563
01:29:58.951 --> 01:30:01.410
You want to make a right or left hand turn.
He got to go down,

1564
01:30:01.411 --> 01:30:03.300
let's say third or second,

1565
01:30:03.301 --> 01:30:06.960
got to go down one or two gears and you're all the way hard on the brakes.

1566
01:30:07.230 --> 01:30:10.590
The travel different between the brake pedal and the throttle on those new cars

1567
01:30:10.830 --> 01:30:14.580
is almost too big to rollover in heel and toe.
So you know,

1568
01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:16.560
they've sort of come around that with that sport.

1569
01:30:16.561 --> 01:30:20.280
Plus mode where automatically blips the throttle for years.

1570
01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:22.350
What I wanted to ask too,
when I first got in the car,
you know,

1571
01:30:22.351 --> 01:30:25.980
I can get it where I my first almost on a 45 degree angle,

1572
01:30:25.981 --> 01:30:29.460
nice sideways where I can roll off,
uh,
you know,

1573
01:30:29.461 --> 01:30:32.610
kick my foot on the brake but still modulate the throttle at the same time.

1574
01:30:32.910 --> 01:30:37.830
So what I ended up doing was double blipping I'd blip and then almost the exact

1575
01:30:37.831 --> 01:30:42.360
same time the computer would automatically blip the throttle to match the revs

1576
01:30:42.510 --> 01:30:45.540
assuming that Porsche thought most people don't know how to heal and toe.

1577
01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:48.060
Now the rev matching the

1578
01:30:48.750 --> 01:30:53.000
<v 3>on new cars.
I think the Nissan three 70 was one of the first cars to do it.
Yeah.</v>

1579
01:30:53.020 --> 01:30:57.350
There's actually the newest Porsche,
which is sort of known as the,
we're sorry,

1580
01:30:57.351 --> 01:31:01.150
addition Porsche to for gt three guys of what they did is,
as I said,

1581
01:31:01.151 --> 01:31:03.790
the nine one one gt three came out only in PDK.

1582
01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:07.570
The gts now has a proper manual transmission,

1583
01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:10.570
not like the fake manual transmission.
With the nine,
nine one?

1584
01:31:10.750 --> 01:31:15.580
Well it was actually that you could get a manual,
a seven speed,
um,
nine,

1585
01:31:15.581 --> 01:31:19.840
nine one if you really,
really tried.
But it was essentially just a PDK box.

1586
01:31:19.841 --> 01:31:22.050
That's all it was with a fricking gear shift there.

1587
01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:25.600
And then what's the difference?
Well I think Chris Harris explained it.
Oh,

1588
01:31:25.601 --> 01:31:28.240
the new ones.
A real Christian Hindu explain it.
Yeah.

1589
01:31:28.241 --> 01:31:31.360
To get Chris and he's got it.
Yeah,
I know.
Well he like he was saying,

1590
01:31:31.361 --> 01:31:34.780
you know like you can,
you can go into like seventh gear and it's all like,

1591
01:31:35.110 --> 01:31:38.720
like this.
And is this just,
it's such an odd gear on those by now and once.

1592
01:31:38.721 --> 01:31:41.990
Cause when are you ever in seventh grade if you're driving to Vegas because,

1593
01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:46.090
cause it was a PDK transmission,
they have to get,
the new one exists.

1594
01:31:46.091 --> 01:31:49.380
I mean they have a six speed manual transmission.
That's a new transmission.

1595
01:31:50.170 --> 01:31:52.930
The new one is the seven speed is a new one.

1596
01:31:52.990 --> 01:31:57.790
That's what I'm speeding sport mode,
uh,
yet does no,
no it doesn't.

1597
01:31:57.791 --> 01:31:59.980
It doesn't go like [inaudible] speed

1598
01:32:00.390 --> 01:32:01.240
<v 1>if it's so annoying,</v>

1599
01:32:03.190 --> 01:32:06.470
but they have to use it because it's a PDK transmission.
It's got seven years.

1600
01:32:06.580 --> 01:32:09.010
Those new cars.
When do you get an a nine,
nine one and it's PD.

1601
01:32:09.011 --> 01:32:12.610
Can you just driving around town before you even up 50 miles an hour.

1602
01:32:12.611 --> 01:32:14.920
You were in sixth or seventh year for folks focusing on know what the fuck are

1603
01:32:14.921 --> 01:32:19.210
we talking about?
[inaudible] it's a German word.

1604
01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:24.100
Partial Double Club.
Dong Dong,
Ding Dong.
It's a crazy long word,

1605
01:32:24.101 --> 01:32:25.720
but what it stands for is two clutches.

1606
01:32:25.721 --> 01:32:28.600
And what it means is that there's one clutch that grabs the gear.

1607
01:32:28.610 --> 01:32:31.830
The second clutch already has the second gear grabs you.

1608
01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:35.620
So the change between gears,

1609
01:32:35.621 --> 01:32:39.460
which we first and second gear is literally instantaneous.
It's,
it's so fast.

1610
01:32:39.550 --> 01:32:42.880
Say your,
your brain can barely perceive it.
So as you're driving,

1611
01:32:42.881 --> 01:32:46.540
when you're driving a manual car,
like man,
you let off the gas,
he hit the clutch,

1612
01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:51.180
Wang,
you put it in the next gear.
This one's like,
man,

1613
01:32:51.710 --> 01:32:56.290
it's just so quickly that there's no way you'd have bill to do it on your own.

1614
01:32:56.291 --> 01:32:58.240
That's the fault of the Nissan Gtr.
By the way.

1615
01:32:58.390 --> 01:33:02.530
The Nissan GTR being so fast and so technologically and never says that calls

1616
01:33:02.531 --> 01:33:03.550
solace though,
right?

1617
01:33:03.710 --> 01:33:06.620
<v 3>Well actually what nobody says really?
Well,
yeah.</v>

1618
01:33:06.621 --> 01:33:09.800
W which is really annoying because some of my customers bought them.
They,

1619
01:33:09.890 --> 01:33:11.690
they fell for the hype,
and don't get me wrong,

1620
01:33:11.691 --> 01:33:16.490
it's amazing technological piece of blocky something.

1621
01:33:17.150 --> 01:33:22.100
But what it does is it takes a lot of weight.
That's a really,
really heavy car.

1622
01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:26.960
So a lot of journalists will take it a few hot laps and it's like,
man,

1623
01:33:26.961 --> 01:33:28.610
look at this lap times.
Look at the lap times.

1624
01:33:28.611 --> 01:33:31.970
But the guys actually ended up buying them and going on the weekend.

1625
01:33:32.570 --> 01:33:36.290
They would have to,
you know,
like change trends,
change the fluids they were,

1626
01:33:36.350 --> 01:33:39.770
the breaks would be cooked after like one session and one session.
Meaning,

1627
01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:43.620
you know,
20,
30 minutes.
Not much.
The Porsche is,
you just bang on them,
you know,

1628
01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:45.650
change them.
You change breaks and stuff.
Yeah.

1629
01:33:45.650 --> 01:33:48.730
<v 1>Eventually they have ceramic breaks.
They have them too.</v>

1630
01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:50.180
They can just have that option.

1631
01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:53.880
<v 3>Um,
yeah.
Even Corvettes have him,
you know.
Sorry,
not even car.
I'm just saying,</v>

1632
01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:57.360
<v 1>you know,
cars are a lot less coal vet.
Let's be honest.
That's a lot of bad ass.</v>

1633
01:33:58.290 --> 01:34:01.560
Oh,
you were telling me that you had driven around the corvette,

1634
01:34:01.561 --> 01:34:05.760
z o or the a Camaro Zl one.
And you were saying how addictive that was.

1635
01:34:05.970 --> 01:34:08.400
I was who shows me at the Zr one.

1636
01:34:08.820 --> 01:34:12.000
But you got a chance to drive the Camaro for a while,
didn't you?
Oh,

1637
01:34:12.001 --> 01:34:16.200
there's the 28 you're talking to you about before.
You didn't drive the Zl one.

1638
01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:19.230
No.
God Damn Way.
Most of the other guy with the beard.

1639
01:34:20.340 --> 01:34:24.810
If you've never driven one of those Camaro's no,
no.
It wasn't yesterday.

1640
01:34:25.390 --> 01:34:27.510
Super B,
but no,
never Camaro.

1641
01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:31.260
You've never driven one than never loaned you mail for awhile.
No.
God,

1642
01:34:31.261 --> 01:34:35.240
why do I feel like it was you?
You were talking about the visited by Bib,

1643
01:34:36.170 --> 01:34:38.970
by Volvo.
I got visited by Ben,
believe it or not,

1644
01:34:38.971 --> 01:34:42.860
the guy from Butte Gatti but yeah,
no other than than portion.

1645
01:34:42.861 --> 01:34:46.520
No one's ever alone because I'm just,
or shark works.
Yeah.
All shot.
Well,
you know,

1646
01:34:46.530 --> 01:34:50.550
I'm just so thrilled up Porsche loans because,
but no,
not me.

1647
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:54.440
<v 3>Yeah,
no.
But the nine nine one gts to touch on that is the,</v>

1648
01:34:54.890 --> 01:34:59.450
is the latest one that they've just released and it does have a proper manual

1649
01:34:59.451 --> 01:35:01.810
gearbox in it.
Not the pseudo PDA one.

1650
01:35:01.850 --> 01:35:05.210
The scenes like the in between car between the g three and the regular night and

1651
01:35:05.211 --> 01:35:07.190
they're like,
okay,
you can order it in manual.

1652
01:35:07.191 --> 01:35:11.480
We don't care about performance numbers.
Um,
you know,
it's an MNA car.

1653
01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:15.740
It's sort of like a manual gt three if you would.
It's the way,
sorry.

1654
01:35:15.741 --> 01:35:19.330
It is actually aspirate edge.
That's true.
Naturally aspirated dude.

1655
01:35:20.150 --> 01:35:23.330
What the fuck you're talking about?
It's an MNA car.
Basically.

1656
01:35:23.331 --> 01:35:27.530
It doesn't have the hairdryers or a blower or any forced induction booze.

1657
01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:32.210
All it is,
is vacuum and a good car.
This GTS,

1658
01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:34.400
a lot of journalists are raving about it.

1659
01:35:34.401 --> 01:35:37.640
I think Chris Harris was about to go drive it after your show or he was back

1660
01:35:37.641 --> 01:35:41.720
from it.
I'm not sure.
But um,
Ralph you drove.
It didn't you,
uh,

1661
01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:44.900
or they took it up to you and you didn't like the automatic Blippar he didn't

1662
01:35:44.901 --> 01:35:48.440
like that.
No one can hear you.
So yeah,

1663
01:35:48.770 --> 01:35:52.670
unfortunately she want to get on the microphone but basically,
sorry.
Yeah,

1664
01:35:52.700 --> 01:35:57.230
but um,
yeah,
sorry dude.
Um,
if you,

1665
01:35:57.470 --> 01:36:00.620
if you want a manual modern nine nine one platform,

1666
01:36:00.860 --> 01:36:04.220
that's the car to buy right now at this very time.
I don't want one,

1667
01:36:04.221 --> 01:36:05.054
but that's if you want.

1668
01:36:05.170 --> 01:36:07.570
<v 2>And what are they going to do with this gt four?
What's the specs?</v>

1669
01:36:07.571 --> 01:36:09.790
Is it going to be a fast car?
The Cayman Gt four.

1670
01:36:09.791 --> 01:36:12.790
It's funny you talk to people at Porsche and they won't tell you anything about

1671
01:36:12.791 --> 01:36:13.530
it.
You know,

1672
01:36:13.530 --> 01:36:18.530
say it's essentially a Cayman gts are on steroids with suppose a gt three s

1673
01:36:20.650 --> 01:36:25.650
performance right in the mid engined already great handling Cayman Package.

1674
01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:30.070
Well,
that's the thing about the Cayman for people who aren't aware,

1675
01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:35.100
nine eleven's our rear engine car and there's certain inherent flaws in having

1676
01:36:35.411 --> 01:36:38.620
all the weight in the back of the car and you move it bullet to the middle for

1677
01:36:38.621 --> 01:36:42.700
the Cayman.
They came in,
which is a mid engine car is better balanced,

1678
01:36:42.701 --> 01:36:44.260
but they have purposely,

1679
01:36:44.410 --> 01:36:49.030
Porsche has an underpowered that car in order to keep the nine 11 of the top of

1680
01:36:49.031 --> 01:36:51.940
the food chain.
So we sort of being handicapped because as we know,

1681
01:36:51.941 --> 01:36:56.790
the nine eleven's top dog been around for 50 years.
Essentially the Cayman,
uh,

1682
01:36:56.980 --> 01:37:00.700
handling capabilities are really,
really high.
I mean,
you didn't get an a Cayman,

1683
01:37:01.270 --> 01:37:04.530
you know,
and go fast.
Really,
really quick push alone.
Big,
uh,

1684
01:37:04.690 --> 01:37:09.430
came in last year for a week.
And my favorite Goto road is Angeles crest highway.

1685
01:37:09.850 --> 01:37:12.670
And then I had two of them,
uh,
manual MPD.
Kay.

1686
01:37:13.310 --> 01:37:16.600
And I'm pretty comfortable in the Angeles crest highway.
I drive it all the time.

1687
01:37:16.601 --> 01:37:17.550
And two 77,

1688
01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:22.560
I was amazed at how much quicker it was or I was in the Cayman with less effort.

1689
01:37:24.550 --> 01:37:28.090
So back to the original question,
you know,
the reward,
you know,

1690
01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:31.480
the payoff versus the effort put in,
um,
quicker in the Cayman.

1691
01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:34.090
But the drive is not quite as rewarding.
Right.

1692
01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:36.920
Cause I'm not quite as involved with it.
We had a,

1693
01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:38.530
we had the first year it came out,

1694
01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:43.200
<v 3>we built,
we built the first year it came and asked as a,
as a shop car and it,</v>

1695
01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:44.790
and then uh,
you know,

1696
01:37:44.791 --> 01:37:48.000
it got tracked a lot and went up through the canyons and I'll say,
you know,

1697
01:37:48.001 --> 01:37:50.640
it's an o six came and asked and we added a bunch of more power,

1698
01:37:50.641 --> 01:37:54.500
lightweight flywheel,
better suspension,
better brakes,
tried to make,
you know,

1699
01:37:54.510 --> 01:37:56.880
better seats.
Tried to make it like a canyon carver.

1700
01:37:56.881 --> 01:37:59.970
And it was easier to drive fast.

1701
01:37:59.971 --> 01:38:03.240
And it was also like anyone could get in it cause it was just really well

1702
01:38:03.241 --> 01:38:07.770
balanced and drive it fast.
But it was missing,
you know,
the special engine,

1703
01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:11.430
the whole connection,
you know,
the steering wasn't quite the same.

1704
01:38:11.431 --> 01:38:12.930
The feel wasn't the same.
I mean,

1705
01:38:12.931 --> 01:38:16.500
it's really nice to have that engine over the back because it's always like

1706
01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:18.180
tugging at you and you've got to think about it.

1707
01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:20.550
Whereas when you're in the Cayman,
you can just drive like an idiot.

1708
01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:22.390
<v 2>But isn't that a crazy thing to say?</v>

1709
01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:26.260
It's good to have a flaw because you have to think about that flaw in counter,

1710
01:38:26.261 --> 01:38:31.180
that philosophy,
moral law that they've worked for that until you look at it,

1711
01:38:31.181 --> 01:38:34.480
you know you can rotate a lot quicker.
Yeah.
So and have,

1712
01:38:34.610 --> 01:38:36.470
and you can put more power down better too.
Right?

1713
01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:40.080
Because you not traction in the wheels.
I mean that's why nine 11 down,

1714
01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:41.800
you weren't that gt two,
well yeah,

1715
01:38:41.801 --> 01:38:45.960
800 horsepower he's spending but call number two 77 with a quarter of that,

1716
01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:48.130
that power just Biden into the ground.
Yeah.

1717
01:38:48.270 --> 01:38:50.800
<v 3>And you can come out,
you get as much better corner speed xx</v>

1718
01:38:51.020 --> 01:38:51.180
<v 2>you,</v>

1719
01:38:51.180 --> 01:38:54.460
which is why I'm still a believer in a sense of less is more because you've got

1720
01:38:54.461 --> 01:38:57.130
to put more and it's a more real,
I keep going back to reward.

1721
01:38:57.131 --> 01:39:00.850
That was what I was going to get to.
Are you,
are you more comfortable?

1722
01:39:00.851 --> 01:39:05.851
Do you enjoy the older cars better or do you enjoy like a like a 4.1 gt three

1723
01:39:06.101 --> 01:39:11.101
when you're getting in the 4.1 you're doing any nine 11 beyond my 1979 nine 11

1724
01:39:12.380 --> 01:39:16.140
sc yet I've owned over 59 eleven's.

1725
01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:21.450
I bought my first one 23 years ago.
But you've driven the other carbon them.

1726
01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:26.800
I do see in my future a space in the garage for a newer Porsche nine 11 probably

1727
01:39:28.631 --> 01:39:33.631
some form of nine nine six or nine nine seven gt three but I also just said

1728
01:39:33.821 --> 01:39:36.070
earlier on,
I want to get one of every generation.

1729
01:39:36.460 --> 01:39:39.790
I also recently bought a nine 24 let's talk about Porsche's.

1730
01:39:40.090 --> 01:39:45.090
Unloved caused nine 24 I bought a 1989 24 front engine turbo.

1731
01:39:46.270 --> 01:39:49.690
That was Porsche's first production front engine water called Turbo.

1732
01:39:49.930 --> 01:39:53.950
So my new goal is to have one of each of the three let's call them ugly
duckling,

1733
01:39:53.951 --> 01:39:58.951
Porsches nine two four nine four four a nine 28 nine 28 is a weird one,

1734
01:39:59.201 --> 01:40:02.150
Huh?
Yeah,
I mean,
you know what I mean?
It's just back to variety.

1735
01:40:02.151 --> 01:40:06.280
It's like I've been so focused on early,
early Porsches and I've driven,

1736
01:40:06.281 --> 01:40:10.330
you know 40 almost 50 of my cars have been early portion,

1737
01:40:10.780 --> 01:40:13.450
so I've sort of covered that base.
You know I've covered,

1738
01:40:13.510 --> 01:40:17.620
I've got one of the first year in 1964 and I've driven the,

1739
01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:22.210
the tail and buck and let's call it the iconic 73 Rs Carrera.

1740
01:40:22.690 --> 01:40:26.950
And they all sort of drive in a sense,
same but different is how I describe it.

1741
01:40:27.310 --> 01:40:29.770
So you know,
now I'm back to variety.
You know,

1742
01:40:29.830 --> 01:40:34.830
walk is more variety than a nine 24 940400920 eight this is disgusting cars,

1743
01:40:35.540 --> 01:40:39.790
unbelievable cars at all.
My nine 24 terabyte cost me 4,500 bucks.

1744
01:40:39.950 --> 01:40:43.450
It's unbelievable.
I'll tell,
I swear to God,
I took a couple of posts out there.

1745
01:40:43.451 --> 01:40:46.510
It's silver with charcoal,
has got the black and white,

1746
01:40:46.511 --> 01:40:49.690
what Porsche calls pasture or checkerboard interior.

1747
01:40:50.020 --> 01:40:53.140
And the funny parts of that story is it took about a day before,

1748
01:40:53.410 --> 01:40:56.170
I didn't even know the nine 24 form existed,

1749
01:40:56.650 --> 01:40:59.740
but a post and a thread developed on the nine 24 forum.

1750
01:40:59.770 --> 01:41:04.270
Someone sent me a link to it and the title was watch nine 24 prices go up.

1751
01:41:04.271 --> 01:41:09.040
Look who just bought one and those this whole like rambling thread about why

1752
01:41:09.041 --> 01:41:13.540
would I have bought a nine 24 I'm a nine 11 guy but lots of bang for the buck

1753
01:41:13.541 --> 01:41:15.910
and back to variety there.
Also very well balanced.

1754
01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:17.400
I have a friend who races them,

1755
01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:22.840
loves (920) 920-4944 spec series is phenomenally successful.

1756
01:41:24.791 --> 01:41:29.080
Just like the box the series and people email me all the time sitting on it

1757
01:41:29.260 --> 01:41:32.290
falls into a few categories obviously people like in the cars,

1758
01:41:32.350 --> 01:41:37.120
but my favorite sort of category of emails that I receive is from non Porsche

1759
01:41:37.121 --> 01:41:42.121
people that have maybe seen urban outlaw maybe followed my bills and all of a

1760
01:41:42.311 --> 01:41:47.170
sudden of being turned around from being Porsche haters into all of a sudden

1761
01:41:47.171 --> 01:41:48.910
looking at Porsche or a little bit differently.

1762
01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:53.110
Predominantly the early cars and these are guys that are looking to get into a

1763
01:41:53.111 --> 01:41:54.460
Porsche for the first time.

1764
01:41:54.770 --> 01:41:58.100
<v 5>I wanted to pull up,
pull up this video,
what we talked about before,</v>

1765
01:41:58.101 --> 01:42:03.101
the show Jack Olsen's nine 11 verses 1970 291119702911 versus a gt nine nine one

1766
01:42:08.241 --> 01:42:13.241
gt three and a Jack Olson is a writer in Hollywood who is a really fascinating

1767
01:42:14.391 --> 01:42:18.230
character.
I'm going to get him on the podcast too.
We talked about it and uh,

1768
01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:23.060
he as essentially had this lifelong,
there's a video.
Uh,
Jamie,

1769
01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:26.750
there's a,
um,
I can email it to you if you want me to do want me to email too.

1770
01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:29.170
<v 2>Okay.
I believe you actually I was a a Po,</v>

1771
01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:32.580
I met Jack over 12 years ago when he was first developed and not current.

1772
01:42:32.581 --> 01:42:36.790
It's gone through several phases and I remember giving him a call number two,

1773
01:42:36.791 --> 01:42:37.541
seven seven.

1774
01:42:37.541 --> 01:42:41.200
Ironically at Acu when I first got it and Jack Carlson was looking for an AC

1775
01:42:41.410 --> 01:42:46.060
compressor and actually gave him my compressor that I think it's in that car,

1776
01:42:46.930 --> 01:42:50.200
but cool guy and has really fine tune and develop that car.

1777
01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:53.170
Spent a lot of time at willow springs.
I think what you're getting at here,

1778
01:42:53.171 --> 01:42:56.710
there's pretty much every person you mentioned here with a Porsche is a wacky

1779
01:42:56.711 --> 01:42:57.900
son of a bitch.
Yeah.

1780
01:42:59.190 --> 01:43:02.220
<v 5>We're all passionate
about this.</v>

1781
01:43:03.180 --> 01:43:06.390
Dealing with the co no,
this is not a,
yeah.
Okay.
This is it.
Nine,

1782
01:43:06.391 --> 01:43:10.110
nine one shitty driving both cause no,
no.
They have a professional driver.

1783
01:43:10.111 --> 01:43:12.630
And what's interesting is that his car,

1784
01:43:12.631 --> 01:43:17.631
which is in 1972 car only has 272 horsepower.

1785
01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:22.440
It's very light.
It's around 2100 pounds.
And the modern car,

1786
01:43:22.441 --> 01:43:27.270
which is 475 horsepower PDK transmission to the automatic transmission,

1787
01:43:27.271 --> 01:43:29.520
the whole deal,
all the technological innovation,

1788
01:43:29.730 --> 01:43:33.780
all the suspension and traction control and a professional driver and Olsen is

1789
01:43:33.781 --> 01:43:38.310
still quicker.
Who's driving both kinds?
I don't know.
Jack's driving his car,

1790
01:43:38.311 --> 01:43:39.720
which is the 1972 car.
Okay.

1791
01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:44.520
But what's interesting to me is Olsen is obsessed with is one track with this

1792
01:43:44.521 --> 01:43:47.070
one car and tweaking everything,

1793
01:43:47.071 --> 01:43:49.320
constantly trying to shave seconds off of his car,

1794
01:43:49.321 --> 01:43:52.310
trying to hit the perfect line every time.
And in doing so,

1795
01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:55.700
<v 1>he's able to drive faster around willow springs,</v>

1796
01:43:55.701 --> 01:43:58.820
which is one of the fastest race tracks in America,
this road in the West.

1797
01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:04.060
And he's able to drive faster with his 1972 lightweight low horsepower car than

1798
01:44:07.100 --> 01:44:08.360
the most modern,

1799
01:44:08.361 --> 01:44:12.140
most spectacular version of the nine nine one gt three.

1800
01:44:12.310 --> 01:44:14.430
That is a lot of power though,
for that car.
I mean they,

1801
01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:16.130
they never came with that kind of power.
Well,

1802
01:44:16.131 --> 01:44:19.480
he's got a three six but it's still only 272 horse boy.
I know,

1803
01:44:19.481 --> 01:44:23.660
but they kept the wheels,
right?
Well,
it's a nine nine three stock edge.
That's,

1804
01:44:24.140 --> 01:44:26.910
think about it.
What did it come with stock,
right?
That was about it.

1805
01:44:27.020 --> 01:44:28.090
Probably 180 oh,

1806
01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:33.100
you mean the original 72 if you said to be one 30 if it was at one 36 30 yeah.

1807
01:44:33.861 --> 01:44:36.320
Well,
he's definitely added more horsepower,
but it's still,

1808
01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:40.150
no in 1997 technology,
I mean the,

1809
01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:44.390
at the height of whatever he's got,
it's 1997 technology along with some tweaks.

1810
01:44:44.630 --> 01:44:48.590
He's got some very custom wheels.
He's got Fukes centers with like,

1811
01:44:48.591 --> 01:44:53.090
I think he uses like a corvette middle.
Like he,
the,
the the wheel is the,

1812
01:44:53.100 --> 01:44:56.060
all his tires and wheels or customer.
I got a question for you then.

1813
01:44:56.061 --> 01:45:00.740
So of the two guys in the car,
right,
I don't even care who wins.
I know who wins,

1814
01:45:00.741 --> 01:45:05.450
but when they come in,
who do you think was having more fun?
Jack,
exactly.

1815
01:45:05.540 --> 01:45:07.130
You see what?
And you asked the pro driver,

1816
01:45:07.131 --> 01:45:09.890
I bet you if he drove the other one and even if he was slower,

1817
01:45:09.891 --> 01:45:11.440
he'd say it was more fun in the other car.

1818
01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:14.360
Well also Jack's having more fun in the corners.

1819
01:45:14.361 --> 01:45:16.370
Like he's keeping up in the corner.

1820
01:45:16.371 --> 01:45:20.290
The other guy is catching him on the straights.
I mean that's where it is.

1821
01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:22.790
Just raw horsepower.
It's straight line traction.

1822
01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:26.570
I mean he could probably have a similar time in like a,
you know,

1823
01:45:26.571 --> 01:45:29.690
a modern chapter one 20 wall.
I don't remember.

1824
01:45:29.691 --> 01:45:33.010
I don't remember what the numbers are but I remember that Jax was quicker but

1825
01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:37.190
that's just kind of it.
He was coming around turn nine if you watched the video.

1826
01:45:37.191 --> 01:45:41.330
It's really interesting because Jack narrates it and talks about the differences

1827
01:45:41.331 --> 01:45:45.060
between the two cars.
He knows his way around willow.
Yeah.
Cool.

1828
01:45:45.230 --> 01:45:49.250
Well that's also part of the rub is that one 26 so he,
you know,

1829
01:45:49.251 --> 01:45:53.500
look at that age.
So you know your car,
uh,

1830
01:45:53.860 --> 01:45:58.250
to the GT three Rs with three nine.
So I had a pro driver court Wagner,

1831
01:45:59.260 --> 01:46:01.790
like a,
the video you saw with the two green cars.
Yes.

1832
01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:05.900
So that day he was in the one 20 fours and that was on shitty tires.

1833
01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:07.460
So just letting you know.
Yeah.

1834
01:46:07.461 --> 01:46:12.461
I think a real test that is to have a pro driver drive the same cards cause we

1835
01:46:12.951 --> 01:46:16.160
don't have the gun.
I know Jack's got thousands of laps at willow.

1836
01:46:16.161 --> 01:46:20.000
We don't know who the other guy is.
Yes.
I think you put some on let,

1837
01:46:20.001 --> 01:46:23.530
let's say like a Pat Long,
you know I was driving with Pantene last week.

1838
01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:28.400
The guy that you put those guys in the car and see that small of a true test I

1839
01:46:28.401 --> 01:46:32.000
think.
Yeah,
same guy driving both calls on the track.
It's still,

1840
01:46:32.001 --> 01:46:35.030
it shows that you know like your car is not even your car,

1841
01:46:35.031 --> 01:46:38.480
which is for four years older than the new generation nine nine one gt three

1842
01:46:38.481 --> 01:46:42.350
it's not slower.
Right,
right.
Yeah.
No,
it's just still having more fun.

1843
01:46:42.380 --> 01:46:44.930
It's different.
I think it's all about the driver though.

1844
01:46:44.931 --> 01:46:47.480
Cause you know we were up in Angeles Cressey of the day.

1845
01:46:47.690 --> 01:46:52.690
I'm driving to 77 and you were with James in the gt three 3.9 yes,

1846
01:46:53.821 --> 01:46:58.380
that's right.
And
it's all about the driver.

1847
01:46:58.381 --> 01:47:02.670
I think the behind the car is what I'm trying to say.
The what,
what,

1848
01:47:02.790 --> 01:47:07.790
what Jack showing here is that these lightweight cars have distinct advantages.

1849
01:47:08.430 --> 01:47:12.210
They have this show Pantages and cornering,
handling everything.
My question is,

1850
01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:15.420
isn't,
isn't that also what you're getting?

1851
01:47:15.421 --> 01:47:19.710
Like this tactile response and feel from is the fact that these cars are so

1852
01:47:19.711 --> 01:47:23.280
light.
So there's just tremendous benefit in having a lightweight,

1853
01:47:23.490 --> 01:47:28.490
super nimble like the Lotus Elise Chapman.

1854
01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:32.800
So you know,
mantra,
why doesn't Porsche develop ideas?

1855
01:47:34.230 --> 01:47:35.620
Safety?
You know,

1856
01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:38.080
<v 3>they talked about it though.</v>

1857
01:47:38.090 --> 01:47:42.050
I remember there was supposed to be that collaborative effort with VW few years

1858
01:47:42.050 --> 01:47:46.970
ago.
Keep this thing as close to a collaborative effort of like a mid engine.

1859
01:47:46.971 --> 01:47:50.420
It was only going to have 200 horsepower and it was going to be about 2,500

1860
01:47:50.421 --> 01:47:53.210
pounds.
Okay.
It's not as light,
but that's light.
It's still pretty light.
Yeah.

1861
01:47:53.240 --> 01:47:57.200
And it would have been a fun sort of Elise ask kind of effort,
but no.

1862
01:47:57.201 --> 01:48:00.320
Instead they decided to,
you know,
release another Panamera and other Cayenne.

1863
01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:03.490
<v 1>And when you get to the case,
which is a very lightweight car for,</v>

1864
01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:07.070
for modern standards,
it's about 3000 pounds for the GTS.
Right.

1865
01:48:07.100 --> 01:48:09.290
Is it about somewhere where it'll be?
It'll be around there.
Yeah.

1866
01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:11.310
That's pretty light,
right?
Yeah.
I mean

1867
01:48:13.550 --> 01:48:17.540
things have just got obviously heavier and bulkier and more sort of bloated.

1868
01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:22.460
Yeah.
The not necessarily faster though.
No,
I still think I keep going back to it.

1869
01:48:22.461 --> 01:48:24.140
Less is more,
but I think those,

1870
01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:28.610
those times have gone when it comes to new cause push is not going to start

1871
01:48:28.611 --> 01:48:32.900
making a 2,500 pound nine 11.
I've never gone down ever.
Well why not?

1872
01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:37.800
Because it's just,
they,
they get sued because someone would die in an accident.

1873
01:48:37.810 --> 01:48:40.880
And Amy airbags can't you put an air bag in it.
I mean,

1874
01:48:40.881 --> 01:48:44.450
how much they weigh a lot when you have eight of them.
Oh,
I see.

1875
01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:46.190
It would have to have modern standards should be,

1876
01:48:46.191 --> 01:48:49.970
there's several safety standards were not ones of what sort of killed everything

1877
01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:55.730
<v 3>I've had.
I've had a 90,
uh,
1979,
11 t with a 3.0 in it,</v>

1878
01:48:56.160 --> 01:49:00.700
uh,
you know,
cams or mismatched cams.
But nevermind.
Um,
and I've had a,
you know,

1879
01:49:00.701 --> 01:49:05.290
79,
nine 30.
So,
you know,
I've,
I've owned those cars too.

1880
01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:10.080
Um,
I've sold them at the absolute worst time now that we're timing.
When I do,

1881
01:49:10.180 --> 01:49:14.380
when I,
I see them now and they're worth way too much.
But um,

1882
01:49:14.500 --> 01:49:17.020
but I've driven them enough to and,
and older cars,
you know,

1883
01:49:17.021 --> 01:49:20.600
cause everyone at shark works,
everyone at shark works has had,
you know,

1884
01:49:20.710 --> 01:49:25.370
either a nine,
12 like the absolute base base,
you know,
oldest model,
you know,

1885
01:49:25.750 --> 01:49:30.730
um,
or an,
you know,
James has had a phenomenal amount of old rusty cars.

1886
01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:34.270
Um,
cause they weren't galvanized back then,
but it's a white Guy James.
Right.

1887
01:49:34.271 --> 01:49:36.190
But really he's a quiet going on these,

1888
01:49:36.191 --> 01:49:40.000
these light that scientists that's going to create something and yeah.
Yeah.

1889
01:49:40.001 --> 01:49:42.340
And then you're going to like explode when you hit the gas

1890
01:49:42.590 --> 01:49:45.730
<v 1>ship.
Point being they enjoy the enjoy,
we enjoy it.</v>

1891
01:49:45.731 --> 01:49:47.970
But the reason you and jihadism

1892
01:49:48.050 --> 01:49:49.630
<v 2>cosmo about more,</v>

1893
01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:53.220
<v 3>but it's like,
I like sharks.
There's a lot of different,
sorry man.</v>

1894
01:49:53.460 --> 01:49:56.820
I like sharks as a lot of different species.
You know,

1895
01:49:56.821 --> 01:50:00.750
I like some more than others maybe,
but I like sharks.

1896
01:50:00.751 --> 01:50:04.860
I like nine 11 and there's still a connection there,
you know,
for me driving,

1897
01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:09.300
you know,
a nine oh you know,
my 1979 11 t or my,
you know,

1898
01:50:09.301 --> 01:50:14.160
my speedster replica,
three 56,
you know,
it was nice and I,
you know,

1899
01:50:14.190 --> 01:50:14.520
there's,

1900
01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:18.300
there's still something there that connects all the way up to the GT three.

1901
01:50:18.570 --> 01:50:19.031
You know,
and I,

1902
01:50:19.031 --> 01:50:23.030
I do get that the modern cars are losing and the fact that you can have one of

1903
01:50:23.031 --> 01:50:26.820
them,
I mean,
he's best known collector of air cool cars and you know,

1904
01:50:27.510 --> 01:50:31.090
he pushes the button,
you know,
to his garage and he's got,
you know,

1905
01:50:31.140 --> 01:50:34.380
two water cooled cars in there.
I mean,
that says something,
right?

1906
01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:39.670
<v 2>But water cooled cars you have in your garage
cars,
car,</v>

1907
01:50:39.900 --> 01:50:43.100
they're in there,
but you're letting him borrow them.
He's not buying them.

1908
01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:47.980
I've got a leaky roof and water is leaking in a carriage is a job,

1909
01:50:48.020 --> 01:50:51.560
but you're not,
uh,
you're,
you're,
you're trying to infect him.

1910
01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:56.750
Not with,
not with coal.
Mine met Alex,
I was already,
you know,

1911
01:50:56.790 --> 01:50:59.860
working towards water cooled,
but my heart and soul is air cooled.

1912
01:50:59.861 --> 01:51:03.230
You know I'm going to one water to water cooled cars just for variety.

1913
01:51:03.231 --> 01:51:05.480
Do you like the sound of the air cooled cars better?

1914
01:51:05.481 --> 01:51:08.410
This is sort of a raspy quality though.

1915
01:51:08.540 --> 01:51:10.810
Agonist soak Tim through the cubs or the Mfi.

1916
01:51:10.820 --> 01:51:14.930
It's just a different visceral sensoril feel that the new,

1917
01:51:14.931 --> 01:51:17.360
cause they don't deliver the same way.

1918
01:51:17.510 --> 01:51:22.510
Is there an issue with the cars in traffic like with [inaudible] 77 and traffic

1919
01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:26.000
pretty easy to drive around.
It depends on the Syrian issue.

1920
01:51:26.001 --> 01:51:28.970
Like if you were driving to the airport and you got stuck on the four or five in

1921
01:51:28.971 --> 01:51:31.430
summer,
well two 77 is unbelievable.

1922
01:51:31.431 --> 01:51:35.060
Even on the race track it never gets above two 10 but when you're on traffic

1923
01:51:35.061 --> 01:51:38.630
like stuck bumper to bumper,
it's not,
it doesn't overheat.
The turbo is run hall.

1924
01:51:39.230 --> 01:51:40.700
The early turbos run hot,

1925
01:51:40.701 --> 01:51:45.701
but my oily air cooled cause never get above two 10 to 20 the Sammy my turbo,

1926
01:51:46.941 --> 01:51:51.200
my 76 turbo and I'm driving to my buddy Marty's who's a raw score and received

1927
01:51:51.201 --> 01:51:55.010
or I'm on the one oh one it's a hundred degrees that you know,
that gauge is,

1928
01:51:55.070 --> 01:51:57.740
you know,
crawl in to 40 just because she sat in traffic.

1929
01:51:57.980 --> 01:52:02.930
So the early turbos run hot,
the early sorta a two liter,
two folds in.

1930
01:52:02.931 --> 01:52:05.040
I'm running no issues.
Now.

1931
01:52:05.041 --> 01:52:08.240
Do you take that car places like if you go to the movies we take it somewhere

1932
01:52:08.241 --> 01:52:12.320
and just park it to shut off.
No problem.
You know,

1933
01:52:12.650 --> 01:52:15.050
it's a very valuable car though to just leave parked.

1934
01:52:15.770 --> 01:52:16.850
I never think of it that way.
You know,

1935
01:52:16.851 --> 01:52:20.390
to me the sum of the parts of two 77 there's nothing.
If you,

1936
01:52:20.450 --> 01:52:23.300
if I give you the bill sheet on what that,
what that car is,

1937
01:52:23.301 --> 01:52:25.310
there's nothing really special about it.

1938
01:52:25.700 --> 01:52:29.570
But I think the uniqueness of the car is he's developed his own personality.

1939
01:52:29.930 --> 01:52:32.390
You know,
it's not like I ever raced at Daytona,
but you know,

1940
01:52:32.391 --> 01:52:36.920
I used to do 40 50 track days here in that car with a pusher on a club between

1941
01:52:36.921 --> 01:52:41.921
2002 and 2007 but there's no real significant race history to the car.

1942
01:52:42.410 --> 01:52:44.030
But I think the connection people have to,

1943
01:52:44.031 --> 01:52:47.810
the car really is a real simple theme and message.
He's like,

1944
01:52:48.260 --> 01:52:51.410
just follow you dreams.
You know?
That's,
that was my dream car.

1945
01:52:51.411 --> 01:52:53.420
It still is my dream car.
But it evolved.

1946
01:52:53.421 --> 01:52:57.680
It wasn't like this wasn't like I went out and wrote a check and just got a new

1947
01:52:57.681 --> 01:53:01.310
car delivered.
That call was,
you know,
our board of at Pomona swap meet.

1948
01:53:01.311 --> 01:53:06.060
It wasn't fled.
I talk about customizing Porsche's straight away,

1949
01:53:06.290 --> 01:53:08.180
change the motor in that car and you know,

1950
01:53:08.181 --> 01:53:11.870
just made it look more like a 73 Rs Carrera.

1951
01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:15.860
And that's the great thing about these early Porsche's is the really easy to

1952
01:53:15.861 --> 01:53:18.410
customize.
You know,
we've touched on a little bit,

1953
01:53:18.411 --> 01:53:19.910
a lot of things are interchangeable.

1954
01:53:19.911 --> 01:53:23.300
You can take a two liter motor out and put a three six and if you want,

1955
01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:27.050
that's what Jack Olson did.
Take out these two four and put in a three,
six.

1956
01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:30.560
So last,
the great thing about these nine eleven's in the get driven,

1957
01:53:30.561 --> 01:53:34.340
the develop personality to 70 sevens got personalities.

1958
01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:39.410
Jack 72 black beauty car thing is what he calls it is also pretty unique and got

1959
01:53:39.411 --> 01:53:42.890
personality.
You know,
the two causes a similar yet different.

1960
01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:47.360
That's ultimately the great thing about early Porsche's is the developed

1961
01:53:47.361 --> 01:53:51.380
character and soul over time to slight Patina.
You know,

1962
01:53:51.381 --> 01:53:54.950
some people like shiny cars,
I always say dirt,
don't slow you down.

1963
01:53:54.951 --> 01:53:59.660
I'm not worried about rock chips and scratches because to me those are memorable

1964
01:53:59.661 --> 01:54:03.040
moments that are earned over time and the ruined by getting out there.

1965
01:54:03.150 --> 01:54:07.960
<v 3>Dry Meat,
cover meat.
You never meet a uh,
a guy at a Porsche event or sorry,</v>

1966
01:54:07.970 --> 01:54:12.090
at a cars and coffee event and he proudly proclaims,
you know,

1967
01:54:12.420 --> 01:54:16.020
I've got 305 miles on my,
you know,

1968
01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:18.690
2007 gt three quite the opposite.

1969
01:54:18.691 --> 01:54:23.540
You know Ralph has like 68,000 on his,
on his 3.9 gt three bill,

1970
01:54:23.580 --> 01:54:26.370
sorry,
driven 70 more now.
Yeah.
They're built to be driven.

1971
01:54:26.790 --> 01:54:28.950
And that's how you get connected with the car.

1972
01:54:28.951 --> 01:54:32.100
You don't get connected by it by leaving it in the guero show.
There's some,

1973
01:54:32.310 --> 01:54:34.740
there's some nice sort of curves on it and it looks cool,

1974
01:54:34.950 --> 01:54:38.100
but every time you drive it,
stuff happens.
You know,
if you're,

1975
01:54:38.190 --> 01:54:39.750
if you're driving that particular car,

1976
01:54:39.830 --> 01:54:42.380
<v 2>I think ultimately it's not necessarily about getting familiar to be the</v>

1977
01:54:42.381 --> 01:54:43.340
quickest,
you know,

1978
01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:47.870
it's more about enjoying that journey and just sort of being a room with the
car.

1979
01:54:47.871 --> 01:54:50.930
Yeah.
And these things.
That's the great thing about all car guys.
It's really,

1980
01:54:50.931 --> 01:54:53.960
the great thing about Porsche guys is it is this language.

1981
01:54:53.961 --> 01:54:56.360
I've had people visit me from all over the world.

1982
01:54:56.730 --> 01:54:59.240
Doesn't matter where they speak English,
German or Japanese,

1983
01:54:59.241 --> 01:55:02.640
you speak posher and that's that connection and truth be told.
Yeah,

1984
01:55:02.641 --> 01:55:06.450
I'm an early air cooled guy,
but also like these,
you know,
high horsepower,

1985
01:55:06.530 --> 01:55:10.140
water cooled things.
And to me it's not a case of which is better.

1986
01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:13.040
They've both got soul,
but the both slightly different,

1987
01:55:13.370 --> 01:55:17.600
but the both got personality.
And to me,
I think that sort of sums up everything.

1988
01:55:17.601 --> 01:55:18.200
That was great.
Yeah.

1989
01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:20.710
<v 3>Well James,
you know who resolved,</v>

1990
01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:23.890
he's the guy that built your engine and the other half,
well,

1991
01:55:24.140 --> 01:55:29.000
the other third of shark works.
Um,
he got to drive to two 77,

1992
01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:29.990
you know,
when,

1993
01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:33.020
when they went off in the gt two and I was sitting with him and he's a man of

1994
01:55:33.021 --> 01:55:37.570
few words and you know,
I just slowly like a few corners in,
you know,

1995
01:55:37.580 --> 01:55:42.240
he starts out slowly because it's the two 77 and we were like,
oh,
we're in it.
Um,

1996
01:55:42.620 --> 01:55:44.820
so maybe he's getting people his face,

1997
01:55:44.821 --> 01:55:48.090
his face is going like this and I just turn around and go,

1998
01:55:48.091 --> 01:55:51.960
you're having a good time,
aren't you?
And he's like,
yeah,
you know,
and,
and it's,

1999
01:55:52.290 --> 01:55:56.910
you know,
he drives every day,
you know,
200,000 or whatever,
150,000,

2000
01:55:56.911 --> 01:56:00.000
200,000,
whatever they're worth and build,
you know,
gt three Rs is,

2001
01:56:00.001 --> 01:56:04.260
and he gets back in,
uh,
you know,
in your car and he's like,
it's set up nice.

2002
01:56:04.261 --> 01:56:05.940
It sounds good.
You know,

2003
01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:09.150
it drives properly and he's just having fun in the canyon.

2004
01:56:09.190 --> 01:56:13.030
<v 2>Isn't there something about those old cars to this knowledge that you're in</v>

2005
01:56:13.031 --> 01:56:16.680
something from another era and it's almost like a bit of a time machine and

2006
01:56:16.681 --> 01:56:20.860
stepping back in time.
Yeah.
Like listening to an old song,
you know,
you,
you know,

2007
01:56:20.861 --> 01:56:24.460
you listen to like a led Zeppelin song from 1971 and it's like,

2008
01:56:24.461 --> 01:56:28.900
there's something about,
it makes you think like,
man,
this was going on.

2009
01:56:28.901 --> 01:56:31.690
Like this guy was singing this in a different era.

2010
01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:35.890
The world was different and there's a finite number of those cars as well.

2011
01:56:35.891 --> 01:56:40.560
They will never,
no one's ever going to build another 1971,
nine 11.
It's just,

2012
01:56:40.561 --> 01:56:44.080
it is one of my favorite causes.
My Irish Green 66,

2013
01:56:44.081 --> 01:56:48.700
nine 11 and he's pretty much almost in stock form that it would have been in

2014
01:56:48.701 --> 01:56:53.380
1966 breaks as well.
Yeah.
What it changed where you know,

2015
01:56:53.381 --> 01:56:56.200
obviously it's in you,
but you know the points of my stories,

2016
01:56:56.440 --> 01:57:00.340
the costs 49 years old and it's the best way that you just described it,

2017
01:57:00.341 --> 01:57:05.341
that I could step back in time to 1966 even though I was born in 1967.

2018
01:57:05.830 --> 01:57:10.470
It's like you get in that car and it just,
hey,
it's smell of these early uh,

2019
01:57:10.540 --> 01:57:13.510
air called oil cooled nine eleven's you t you know,

2020
01:57:14.470 --> 01:57:18.790
I'll go through the process.
You look at it,
site,
walk up to it,

2021
01:57:18.791 --> 01:57:23.050
put the key in it tourney,
you sort of feel it and hear it.
Then you sit in it,

2022
01:57:23.051 --> 01:57:24.790
put the key in the ignition,
turn the key.

2023
01:57:25.030 --> 01:57:29.650
You hear it fire up and then you smell it.
And I said,
time capsule right there.

2024
01:57:29.651 --> 01:57:33.730
Yeah,
right.
There is less something modern cars will never give you.
You know,

2025
01:57:33.731 --> 01:57:36.100
we've sort of talked for a couple of hours about the difference,

2026
01:57:36.101 --> 01:57:40.960
but ultimately if I can home and into,
you know,
five senses of sight,
sound,

2027
01:57:40.961 --> 01:57:44.260
smell and feel,
that is the time capsule that I think you just,

2028
01:57:44.270 --> 01:57:48.760
soda brought us full circle into what is great about these early air cooled nine

2029
01:57:48.761 --> 01:57:50.110
eleven's and truth be told,

2030
01:57:50.111 --> 01:57:53.680
it's probably the same thing all the VW guys experience because it is like this

2031
01:57:53.681 --> 01:57:55.390
living,
breathing time,

2032
01:57:55.391 --> 01:57:59.250
warp time travel entity that ultimately doesn't matter really how fast you're

2033
01:57:59.260 --> 01:58:02.860
going.
You just in this zone that is,
yeah,

2034
01:58:02.861 --> 01:58:05.050
it's antiquated but it's also pretty excited,

2035
01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:08.750
<v 3>special,
really great.
You know,
you're picking up my car that was,
you know,</v>

2036
01:58:08.751 --> 01:58:12.650
from 71 and it's like I'm on the road,
you know,

2037
01:58:12.770 --> 01:58:17.720
in rush hour traffic,
you know,
things whizzing by me in a bright yellow,
you know,

2038
01:58:17.750 --> 01:58:22.100
it was like an IRS clone and I'm sitting there,
I've got no AC,
no,

2039
01:58:22.310 --> 01:58:26.060
no nothing,
no cup holders,
nothing.
I mean,
and I'm just,
you know,

2040
01:58:26.090 --> 01:58:29.840
stinking up the place.
But I loved it,
man.
It was just great.
You know,
just,

2041
01:58:29.870 --> 01:58:34.130
and then I got home,
I would take a canyon road near me and it,
I mean

2042
01:58:34.930 --> 01:58:38.860
<v 2>my wife always says Karen,
you know,
when I get home and I've been in a nine 11,</v>

2043
01:58:38.861 --> 01:58:41.350
she can tell up being,
and I love a smell.

2044
01:58:41.351 --> 01:58:43.210
You sort of come in smelling whether it,
you know,

2045
01:58:43.211 --> 01:58:47.760
he's got all those sorta sweat and oil and fuel smell.
I mean,
yeah,

2046
01:58:47.761 --> 01:58:51.130
either love it or you don't really,
you know,
it's an acquired taste for sure.

2047
01:58:51.131 --> 01:58:52.260
But uh,
you know,

2048
01:58:52.510 --> 01:58:54.510
<v 3>[inaudible] number five for us,
right.</v>

2049
01:58:54.790 --> 01:58:58.380
And we drive one of those old carburetor driven car.

2050
01:58:58.430 --> 01:59:02.400
Any even an old muscle you smell?
Sure.
Well,

2051
01:59:02.660 --> 01:59:04.620
always the leaky carburetors.
I mean,

2052
01:59:04.950 --> 01:59:07.530
James helped me rebuild the carbs on mine and it's like,

2053
01:59:07.531 --> 01:59:11.640
I spent like three days on it,
you know,
rebuilding the carbs on that engine.

2054
01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:16.020
I put him in or he helped me and it's like,
son of a bitch,

2055
01:59:16.050 --> 01:59:19.320
I could still smell leaks,
you know?
And it's like,
he's like,
watch this,
how it is,

2056
01:59:19.321 --> 01:59:22.110
you know?
And then in the three days that I'd,

2057
01:59:22.250 --> 01:59:26.700
I'd taken them out and rebuilt them.
The weather,
it changed like 15 degrees,

2058
01:59:27.050 --> 01:59:29.820
you know,
and the car ran like shit,
you know,
I just couldn't handle it.

2059
01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:31.890
So it's like back to the drawing board

2060
01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:37.040
<v 2>joke about it.
If not only nine 11 is not leaking oil,
there's no oil in it.</v>

2061
01:59:37.041 --> 01:59:40.640
These things all sort of living,
breathing,
you know,

2062
01:59:41.060 --> 01:59:43.660
pieces of machinery that have got sole on it.

2063
01:59:43.700 --> 01:59:45.950
That's what your 1965 but with the new,

2064
01:59:45.951 --> 01:59:47.540
with these ones that you've built yourself,

2065
01:59:47.690 --> 01:59:50.780
has there been new technology that allows those things to be a little bit more

2066
01:59:50.781 --> 01:59:54.610
reliable,
have less issues?
Most of the cars that I built out,

2067
01:59:54.650 --> 01:59:59.100
the SDR or you know,
being involved in the process of these,
cause I'm,

2068
01:59:59.330 --> 02:00:03.550
I'm still sort of keeping them period correct and I'm not putting new emote is

2069
02:00:03.560 --> 02:00:06.590
in those old cars.
You know,
you touched on a little bit what singing is doing,

2070
02:00:06.950 --> 02:00:07.790
you know,
the differences.

2071
02:00:07.791 --> 02:00:11.870
They're taking a nine six four and sort of back dating it to resemble an old car

2072
02:00:12.050 --> 02:00:17.030
with modern technology for the most part,
other than update in fob what I do,

2073
02:00:17.330 --> 02:00:22.070
a torsion bars and stiffer suspension,
which yes,
newer components,

2074
02:00:22.071 --> 02:00:24.200
but yet it's still running for the most part,

2075
02:00:24.201 --> 02:00:28.220
the original motor that's being rebuilt.
Maybe the highest SPEC,
but it's still,

2076
02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:31.480
if it was carborated then it's probably still carborated now.
So who,

2077
02:00:31.490 --> 02:00:33.980
what about gasket technology or any of those things?
I mean,

2078
02:00:34.130 --> 02:00:37.670
have there been improvements and,
yeah,
for sure.
But you know,
he's still,
you know,

2079
02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.150
it's like right now I'm building a 67 acids,

2080
02:00:40.190 --> 02:00:44.510
a car that have got the louvered fenders,
which is my followup bill to the SDR.

2081
02:00:44.930 --> 02:00:49.520
I sourced the 67 s case and bought some new Molly Pistons and cylinders.

2082
02:00:49.521 --> 02:00:51.650
And as crazy as this story sounds,

2083
02:00:51.651 --> 02:00:54.920
I'm shipping all the components to my buddy Matthias,

2084
02:00:54.921 --> 02:00:56.810
who's got a shop in Hamburg,
Germany,

2085
02:00:57.170 --> 02:00:59.990
and I'm going to have him build the moat or assemble the motor in Germany and

2086
02:00:59.991 --> 02:01:04.130
ship it back so it'll have new components in it and it's going to be punched out

2087
02:01:04.131 --> 02:01:09.131
from two liter to two five but it's still a 67 ass motor going in 1967 so isn't

2088
02:01:10.221 --> 02:01:11.900
that something that Porsche is doing now?

2089
02:01:11.900 --> 02:01:16.900
They have like an entire factory dedicated to rebuilding old cars to Porsche

2090
02:01:17.361 --> 02:01:21.440
classic restoration facility.
They've actually had for some time.

2091
02:01:21.441 --> 02:01:25.580
But what's happened recently over the past three to five years is,
you know,

2092
02:01:25.581 --> 02:01:30.170
these cars have just escalated and value to the point where now a lot of these,

2093
02:01:30.171 --> 02:01:34.730
cause that let's say would have been trashed five years ago because it wasn't

2094
02:01:34.731 --> 02:01:39.680
worth spending 50 grand to restore car that might be worth 30 now that grand

2095
02:01:39.681 --> 02:01:42.710
coal or a hundred grand cold could be worth triple that.

2096
02:01:42.830 --> 02:01:46.760
What's the name of the Porsche restoration facilities drove the Porsche classic

2097
02:01:46.761 --> 02:01:51.200
restoration facility.
Porsche classic recipe.
Yeah,
Porsche classic.

2098
02:01:51.201 --> 02:01:55.400
It's amazing though.
I've visited,
uh,
you know,
over the past two years,

2099
02:01:55.401 --> 02:01:57.170
I've done various events with Porsche.

2100
02:01:57.171 --> 02:02:00.260
I went to the techno classic is show an Esam with them.

2101
02:02:00.261 --> 02:02:04.390
I went to the old time of GP at the Nurburgring and Goodwood revival.
Yeah,

2102
02:02:04.391 --> 02:02:04.850
that's it.

2103
02:02:04.850 --> 02:02:08.900
So the great thing about Porsche is they've got 50,000 parts in the showcase of

2104
02:02:08.901 --> 02:02:13.460
Porsche classic let's not just three 56 is,
it's all the way up to the a nine,

2105
02:02:13.461 --> 02:02:15.590
nine three facts replacement parts.

2106
02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:20.220
It's also a great thing about Porsche in that they make new parts for their old

2107
02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:24.470
cars.
They continue to make parts for every single model.

2108
02:02:24.471 --> 02:02:25.890
That's why there's so many of them on the road.

2109
02:02:25.891 --> 02:02:27.520
They say these 80% of them still on the road.

2110
02:02:27.530 --> 02:02:32.120
It's incredible how many cars or 40 year old cars are on the road.
I mean,

2111
02:02:32.270 --> 02:02:37.270
well there's companies like year one that make parts for for old muscle cars and

2112
02:02:38.121 --> 02:02:41.060
things along those lines.
But there's very few.
I mean,
truth be told,

2113
02:02:41.061 --> 02:02:42.440
jags got its own thing.
Jag,

2114
02:02:42.460 --> 02:02:46.550
Jaguar has got the heritage facility where they're actually rebuilding 12 of

2115
02:02:46.551 --> 02:02:49.530
those.
A continuation lightweight eat types.
I know for,

2116
02:02:49.531 --> 02:02:54.020
I know Miss Sadie's as been doing it for quite some time.
Those old cars.

2117
02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:55.770
I like that.
Yeah.
Those are the nine five nines.

2118
02:02:55.890 --> 02:02:58.960
Do you know the story of the nine five nine in America?
How you can drive on?

2119
02:02:58.980 --> 02:03:02.780
Do you know why he can drive one in America?
Cause Bill Gates bought two of them.

2120
02:03:02.781 --> 02:03:06.330
I crashed one of them to do the testing,
which is hilarious.

2121
02:03:06.410 --> 02:03:09.590
If you want to get one of those,
you'd probably go to [inaudible].
I mean it's,

2122
02:03:10.010 --> 02:03:11.390
I mean,
how much are those worth?

2123
02:03:11.391 --> 02:03:14.900
I mean that's gotta be worth like nine to now $1 million car.

2124
02:03:14.901 --> 02:03:16.640
And couple of years ago they were like,

2125
02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:21.290
well I remember when the were two 53 meanwhile if you drove that and then drove

2126
02:03:21.291 --> 02:03:23.890
your car back to back and go like fuck this.
Like I said,

2127
02:03:23.920 --> 02:03:28.540
I drove how prototype nine five the Brumos zone.

2128
02:03:29.740 --> 02:03:32.080
Really you?
I was no different to any of the nine 11.

2129
02:03:32.081 --> 02:03:37.081
And it wasn't this brutally just crazy car that they built the gt two,

2130
02:03:38.061 --> 02:03:40.610
which he's just not snapping Lee brutally fast.

2131
02:03:40.850 --> 02:03:42.260
The nine five nine is not like that.

2132
02:03:42.261 --> 02:03:44.510
I mean you've got to remember that how old that car is now.

2133
02:03:44.890 --> 02:03:48.880
<v 3>Eighties,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
86.
It was actually designed,
it was,
it was,
you know,</v>

2134
02:03:48.881 --> 02:03:53.881
I kind of compare it a bit too [inaudible] on a round that over each other too

2135
02:03:54.041 --> 02:03:58.660
much for people.
I take a bathroom break.
Yeah.
But what it did was it,

2136
02:03:58.661 --> 02:04:02.800
um,
it basically was designed to get to 200.
It was like the first,
you know,

2137
02:04:02.801 --> 02:04:05.350
supercar to kind of do that.
Right.
So like the bay run,

2138
02:04:05.560 --> 02:04:09.850
so it wasn't brutally fast,
but it was able to,
you know,

2139
02:04:09.851 --> 02:04:12.970
to go 200 back in 1986 which was a big deal.

2140
02:04:13.090 --> 02:04:17.050
It was one of their first four wheel drive cars too,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well yeah,

2141
02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:21.230
it was,
it had a lot.
Yeah.
All wheel drive.
All wheel is four wheels.
Like he ha,

2142
02:04:21.590 --> 02:04:26.110
yeah,
there's a cool picture or I don't know if you ever,

2143
02:04:26.140 --> 02:04:28.840
do you know about the Perry Dakar Rally for example?
I've heard of it.

2144
02:04:28.950 --> 02:04:33.510
So you should check it out.
People die every year and they go across Africa and,

2145
02:04:33.730 --> 02:04:37.560
and they actually took,
they took nine,
five nines,
you know,
and to like,
you know,

2146
02:04:37.561 --> 02:04:38.150
Roffman's

2147
02:04:38.150 --> 02:04:41.790
<v 4>stuff on it.
You know,
it's a cigarette company.
They raised him,
put knobby tires.</v>

2148
02:04:41.820 --> 02:04:44.970
So the nine,
five,
nine perry.cards.
You check it out.
So it's a nine five,

2149
02:04:44.971 --> 02:04:48.030
nine and they rallied,
raced across Africa and you know,
it did really well.

2150
02:04:48.260 --> 02:04:52.610
Stasiak another iconic nine five nine is so ridiculous.
They take [inaudible],

2151
02:04:52.910 --> 02:04:57.120
which is worth $1 million and they sold back then it wasn't truck.
Yeah,
but it's,

2152
02:04:57.220 --> 02:04:59.300
but they raced it.
That's Porsche.
That's why they're not actually,

2153
02:04:59.340 --> 02:05:04.170
racing is very strange because the cars look so odd.
Jacked up with the,
you know,

2154
02:05:04.171 --> 02:05:08.370
they have to have a lot of suspension travel,
so yeah.
Yup.

2155
02:05:08.640 --> 02:05:12.730
They have to and they have crazy toys.
It just seems wrong though.
Yeah.

2156
02:05:12.760 --> 02:05:17.760
It was wrong to take those cars and to put them with such a wacky suspension

2157
02:05:17.821 --> 02:05:20.590
then drive him over dirt.
When you watch,

2158
02:05:21.960 --> 02:05:25.380
when you watch them all their like but the footage from the seat,
oh my God,

2159
02:05:25.410 --> 02:05:28.280
the guy I'm worried about the navigator though,
the guy reading the,
you know,

2160
02:05:28.380 --> 02:05:31.950
left big bulls and always get blamed too when they crashed.

2161
02:05:31.950 --> 02:05:33.120
It's like it's shocking your fault.

2162
02:05:33.180 --> 02:05:38.010
Google up Pike's peak all Vonda no row voltarol and just see those guys.

2163
02:05:38.060 --> 02:05:40.500
I knew that a big fan of the idea of a navigator,

2164
02:05:40.501 --> 02:05:45.100
I think you should be forced to fucking drive and have gps then.
So what I,

2165
02:05:45.130 --> 02:05:45.400
you know,

2166
02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:48.780
I feel like you should be able to figure out every turn if you go off the side

2167
02:05:48.781 --> 02:05:49.890
of the cliff,
that's parcel,

2168
02:05:49.891 --> 02:05:53.910
you know we were talking about this program called called grand stand,
which um,

2169
02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:55.300
you know on a,

2170
02:05:55.500 --> 02:05:58.740
on a Saturday afternoon in England on one of the three available channels and

2171
02:05:58.741 --> 02:06:00.450
they had this,
have you watched any,

2172
02:06:00.451 --> 02:06:03.960
I love man racing before as this crazy fucking bike guys.
Yeah,
those guys.

2173
02:06:03.970 --> 02:06:07.740
We had a series with these site cars where these guys would like trapeze off the

2174
02:06:07.741 --> 02:06:10.710
side of the bike.
Right.
That's all they did.

2175
02:06:10.710 --> 02:06:13.860
But they would be the first ones to let go flying when the thing crashed.

2176
02:06:13.900 --> 02:06:18.390
I mean it was just into a wall.
Pretty gnarly.
Gnarly Shit.
Huh?
The island man,

2177
02:06:18.391 --> 02:06:23.040
tt is the true test of big bulls in a real hero when he see what those guys,

2178
02:06:23.041 --> 02:06:27.810
those
guys,
one down side.
No,

2179
02:06:28.670 --> 02:06:32.940
no,
no,
no real heroes there.
They're fighting.

2180
02:06:32.941 --> 02:06:36.240
They're fighting for our country or some freedom to go fast and I'm ordering

2181
02:06:36.241 --> 02:06:38.190
cycle.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Those guys are animals.

2182
02:06:38.280 --> 02:06:41.630
There's something really crazy about someone who wants to raise for a living and

2183
02:06:41.631 --> 02:06:45.030
they're like,
McConkie guys,
you know that shortly.
Conky guy for example,

2184
02:06:45.031 --> 02:06:48.660
they're just nuts.
What was the,
the,
the um,
the movie that,

2185
02:06:48.661 --> 02:06:52.690
the recent Formula One movie with Thor with the fuck is rush,
rush,
rush.

2186
02:06:53.950 --> 02:06:57.300
Yeah.
Well that was my era growing up in the 70s you know,

2187
02:06:57.301 --> 02:06:59.870
England in [inaudible] 76 77 James Hunt,

2188
02:06:59.890 --> 02:07:03.630
one of the [inaudible] and Barry Sheene superbike title.

2189
02:07:03.740 --> 02:07:07.110
So that movie didn't get nearly enough respect.
That was a good movie.

2190
02:07:07.180 --> 02:07:10.590
Was Ron Howard's movie on racing?
Yeah,
it's pretty good.
I mean,

2191
02:07:10.591 --> 02:07:13.650
my mom remembers it differently cause she,
she fancy James Hunt.

2192
02:07:13.980 --> 02:07:17.790
A lot of people did those guys.
That was the sex drugs,

2193
02:07:17.791 --> 02:07:22.380
rock and roll era of,
you know,
padding,
the lifestyle,
the glamorous lifestyle.

2194
02:07:22.650 --> 02:07:25.990
Now he's a whole different thing.
I mean the guy's a faster the cause it quick,

2195
02:07:26.010 --> 02:07:28.620
but it's a whole different corporate mentality.

2196
02:07:28.621 --> 02:07:33.621
Look a F1 footage in the 70s and people are practically bare feet smoking in the

2197
02:07:33.841 --> 02:07:38.500
pits.
Look,
how are these,
these
Thor really does look like.

2198
02:07:38.501 --> 02:07:41.370
That guy has got the sticker on the GT two.

2199
02:07:41.500 --> 02:07:45.160
<v 3>Oh yeah.
So yeah.
You know,
remember?
Uh,
yeah,
last time when we were,</v>

2200
02:07:45.250 --> 02:07:47.470
when we came here with the four one,
you know,

2201
02:07:47.471 --> 02:07:52.471
we showed up at Leno's place and damage rang a Hesketh tee shirt and then we

2202
02:07:52.541 --> 02:07:54.460
showed up right to his place.
That's how we met.

2203
02:07:54.461 --> 02:07:57.370
We went off to traffic and he's like Hesketh and he's like,

2204
02:07:57.371 --> 02:07:59.050
you guys are all right.
That's good.

2205
02:07:59.051 --> 02:08:03.270
This heskes in the movie like that you're watching,
you know,
Lord Hesketh,

2206
02:08:03.580 --> 02:08:06.820
he was the,
uh,
you know,
financier for,
for James Hunt.

2207
02:08:07.180 --> 02:08:09.610
<v 4>You got to get your car to Seinfeld,</v>

2208
02:08:09.910 --> 02:08:13.090
you gotta have that nut drive your car cause he's got one of the best Porsche

2209
02:08:13.091 --> 02:08:14.860
collections in the world.
I mean,

2210
02:08:14.861 --> 02:08:18.310
he's a real Porsche aficionados seen that show cars,

2211
02:08:19.630 --> 02:08:21.430
cars getting coffee.
Yeah.
It's pretty,

2212
02:08:21.460 --> 02:08:24.850
it's pretty bad advice as a legit 1972 RS.

2213
02:08:24.851 --> 02:08:28.010
It's worth over a million dollars and he drives it on the street.
Yeah,
I know.

2214
02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:29.360
Which is,
it was,
it wasn't there,

2215
02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:33.830
wasn't there some a swell idea yet backed into it,
right?
Recent did.
Really?
Yeah.

2216
02:08:33.940 --> 02:08:36.490
In New York.
So in New York.
Yeah.
They packed into it.
It's like,
oh,

2217
02:08:36.910 --> 02:08:38.560
and they didn't probably had no idea it was worth a million.

2218
02:08:38.590 --> 02:08:41.200
Now there's like some old stinky Porsche.
Yeah,
that's what it looks like.

2219
02:08:41.201 --> 02:08:44.800
A bunch of ugly decals on it.
Dripping oil,
pearls.
Someone backed up into it hard.

2220
02:08:44.801 --> 02:08:49.120
Is it fucked up?
[inaudible] right.
There's video of it out there.

2221
02:08:49.150 --> 02:08:52.990
I guess you could do a Jerry Seinfeld,
Doris getting rear ended videos.

2222
02:08:52.991 --> 02:08:56.640
It's getting hit.
Yeah.
Oh No.
Yeah.
Yep.

2223
02:08:56.950 --> 02:09:00.430
I want to see how he reacts.
Paranoia.
What are you doing?

2224
02:09:01.750 --> 02:09:05.280
It's almost like you didn't even know him was there.
He's like Gerry,
set right up

2225
02:09:07.390 --> 02:09:10.400
when you were first Tyrone.
Things come from behind Ya.

2226
02:09:12.330 --> 02:09:12.670
Yeah.

2227
02:09:12.670 --> 02:09:17.440
I don't know why anybody would want to spend $1 million on that car.

2228
02:09:17.441 --> 02:09:20.090
I don't understand why to put it when it was at 50 grand car.

2229
02:09:20.230 --> 02:09:24.670
I'm telling you right there.
Hamptons.
Oh,
oh,
sorry.
Oh my God.

2230
02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:27.490
Unapologetic Hampton's woman.
Yeah.

2231
02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:32.590
Now do you Jerry impression right now?
Do you even know what you just did?

2232
02:09:33.970 --> 02:09:37.930
Hi.
Why do you see how happy he looks there?
He looks really happy.

2233
02:09:38.710 --> 02:09:43.390
Is that the before or the guy that's the before shot.
While he watches.
Come on.

2234
02:09:43.391 --> 02:09:47.630
Is there a video?
There was a video.
There you go.
There you go.
Interview.

2235
02:09:48.190 --> 02:09:52.450
Let's hear this.
This video is going to get a lot of ways.
He's now.
He says,

2236
02:09:54.430 --> 02:09:57.510
oh,
he doesn't look happy there it does.
He,
I wonder if he finally swears to,

2237
02:09:57.511 --> 02:10:00.700
this is the great thing about the Internet with talking about it and there it
is.

2238
02:10:00.720 --> 02:10:04.060
There it is.
Is there a video of it?
Look cut there.
Yeah,

2239
02:10:04.061 --> 02:10:08.270
but that's a video of Seinfeld right there.
No,
no.
Those are photos.

2240
02:10:08.650 --> 02:10:13.090
Hey,
what are you doing?
Look at what you're backing into my car.
Hunchback Twat.

2241
02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:16.150
Look at her
backing up and it was car.

2242
02:10:16.151 --> 02:10:20.080
How do you know you can't see your face to the 456,000 what year was this

2243
02:10:20.530 --> 02:10:24.610
correct?
14 that's the problem.
That's the other problem with the Internet.

2244
02:10:24.940 --> 02:10:29.560
Everyone has a fricking opinion.
Scrolling down for video,
where's the video?

2245
02:10:29.740 --> 02:10:31.810
I saw the video.
I saw,
I was saying,
I don't know where it is,

2246
02:10:31.811 --> 02:10:33.950
but maybe he took it down,
baby.

2247
02:10:34.430 --> 02:10:34.641
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

2248
02:10:34.641 --> 02:10:39.641
but it says scroll down for video and the article also Combo getting you read on

2249
02:10:39.900 --> 02:10:43.490
that.
Funny.
You're go into the daily mail,
which is a British tabloid.

2250
02:10:44.070 --> 02:10:46.460
That's British tabloid Daily mail.co.
Dot.
UK.

2251
02:10:46.590 --> 02:10:51.360
<v 5>Isn't that what that you did you guys give us that fucking,
the guy from CNN,</v>

2252
02:10:51.660 --> 02:10:55.920
what's his name?
Oh,
that household,
is that from the Daily Mail?

2253
02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:00.290
<v 3>Yeah,
he's uh,
he,
well,
I don't want to say anything.
He's close.
He's a,
yeah,</v>

2254
02:11:00.291 --> 02:11:03.500
he's not a very nice chap and cal.
And that's the,

2255
02:11:03.620 --> 02:11:06.680
that's the problem with the other problem with the u s like,

2256
02:11:06.710 --> 02:11:10.550
it's sort of like the British rejects.
Well,
no,
hold on,
hold on here.

2257
02:11:10.580 --> 02:11:14.240
[inaudible] come on.
Ricky's grant.
Look a lot of great comics.

2258
02:11:15.470 --> 02:11:19.580
He was not great.
I felt really embarrassed being British with him.
No,
no,

2259
02:11:19.640 --> 02:11:22.030
but that piers guy,
well here's guy got it

2260
02:11:22.590 --> 02:11:26.880
<v 5>owned by Chelsea handler.
You ever see that with Chelsea?
No.
No.</v>

2261
02:11:26.960 --> 02:11:31.430
You got owned by Alex Jones and the gun stuff and by Ted Nugent.
Oh yeah.

2262
02:11:31.690 --> 02:11:35.740
But Chelsea handler,
who's a standup comic just fucking destroyed,

2263
02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:37.740
cause she was like,
you're not even paying attention to me.

2264
02:11:37.741 --> 02:11:40.220
Like [inaudible] during the commercial break.

2265
02:11:40.221 --> 02:11:43.620
You just go over and look at your phone.
Like he's,
he's a fucking moron.

2266
02:11:43.950 --> 02:11:48.000
I didn't enjoy him on that show.
I thought he was just,
first of all,

2267
02:11:48.001 --> 02:11:52.290
I don't enjoy his background.
I mean,
he was a of people,
not just a shyster.

2268
02:11:52.291 --> 02:11:57.240
They tapped into people's phones.
That's not cool.
Why top that were missing.

2269
02:11:57.270 --> 02:12:00.700
And they hacked into these people's phones and listened to their voicemail.

2270
02:12:00.750 --> 02:12:03.810
And so the parents got a false sense of like,
oh,

2271
02:12:03.811 --> 02:12:06.030
they might be still alive checking their voicemail.

2272
02:12:06.300 --> 02:12:09.050
And it was because these shitheads we're tapping into the phone.

2273
02:12:09.070 --> 02:12:11.090
He was a part of all that.
And somehow or another he escaped.

2274
02:12:11.550 --> 02:12:12.870
<v 3>That's where I'm saying,
you know,</v>

2275
02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:17.280
it was easy for him to get in and to impress and get it into the u s and they

2276
02:12:17.281 --> 02:12:21.120
didn't really do a proper background check on him.
And then suddenly you became,

2277
02:12:21.121 --> 02:12:23.970
you know,
a celebrity over here.
We got rid of him pretty quick.
But I'm glad.

2278
02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:25.020
Welcome.

2279
02:12:25.020 --> 02:12:29.550
<v 5>He was shamed many times before.
I mean people got to know what a shithead he is,</v>

2280
02:12:29.790 --> 02:12:32.620
but also we,
we are a sucker for an English accent.

2281
02:12:32.970 --> 02:12:33.870
<v 3>Yeah,
that's what I'm saying.</v>

2282
02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:38.960
And that was my story come in almost 30 years ago now the monkeys throw come

2283
02:12:39.211 --> 02:12:41.760
rolling quite a long way.
But no,
see you don't understand.

2284
02:12:41.761 --> 02:12:43.590
We don't know that that's a northern accent.

2285
02:12:43.591 --> 02:12:47.340
We have no idea because just anyone who speaks [inaudible] stock and two smoking

2286
02:12:47.341 --> 02:12:48.001
barrels,
you know,

2287
02:12:48.001 --> 02:12:51.760
and that will sort of tell you all about the great north south divide.
Yes,

2288
02:12:51.800 --> 02:12:55.920
great guy.
Ritchie's best movie real love it Love Guy Ritchie.
Huge Fan.

2289
02:12:55.950 --> 02:13:00.620
But the funny thing is about,
sorry about Piers Morgan again,
is that if you,

2290
02:13:00.621 --> 02:13:04.140
you know,
if you watch top gear a lot,
he's like the butt of every joke.

2291
02:13:04.141 --> 02:13:08.090
Like anytime there's anything nasty or disgusting,
you know,
you watch,
um,

2292
02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:12.810
you know,
Jeremy Clarkson compare like a car suspension to piers Morgan,
you know,

2293
02:13:12.811 --> 02:13:16.170
banging him in the rear and he's like Moolah,
you know,
so he's,

2294
02:13:16.171 --> 02:13:17.280
he's really not liked.

2295
02:13:17.730 --> 02:13:18.810
<v 5>He shouldn't be,
you know,</v>

2296
02:13:18.811 --> 02:13:22.160
that the thing that they did pull it guys for being British.
Yeah.

2297
02:13:22.230 --> 02:13:25.140
The thing that they did,
what's happening to people's phones.
It's just awful.

2298
02:13:25.410 --> 02:13:29.510
Just disgusting.
And the fact that he snuck in,
but it's like we are,

2299
02:13:29.511 --> 02:13:31.980
we are a weird sucker for English,
which is why

2300
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:35.750
<v 4>those infomercials when they're trying to sell you my favorite thing,</v>

2301
02:13:36.210 --> 02:13:37.910
it's always an English thing.

2302
02:13:39.800 --> 02:13:44.240
It's always the villains in the Hollywood movies or the cleaning product guy.

2303
02:13:44.241 --> 02:13:45.360
It's like,
what would be a cleaning?

2304
02:13:45.361 --> 02:13:48.720
Can we do anything else other than mess portion?
David Beck come over here.

2305
02:13:48.750 --> 02:13:51.920
Come on.
English guys told them at courses.
That's right.
That's right.

2306
02:13:51.940 --> 02:13:56.070
He didn't know.
Yeah,
we're here.
We get spice girls.
Come on.
Yeah,

2307
02:13:56.700 --> 02:13:58.770
a little while,
but we don't give a fuck about soccer.

2308
02:13:58.771 --> 02:14:00.420
You can try all day and we're not going to,

2309
02:14:00.421 --> 02:14:03.750
we did try with debt or rugby or cricket.

2310
02:14:04.530 --> 02:14:06.690
Rugby would be,
would have been a better fit.

2311
02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:10.140
That's a man's game is more manly than even the very close to where I can

2312
02:14:10.141 --> 02:14:13.260
football.
I think if you took American football players and took the helmets,

2313
02:14:13.261 --> 02:14:15.860
Wayne made him play rugby.
That's a more exciting game now.

2314
02:14:15.870 --> 02:14:19.070
She had just got one of my concussions from rugby because I played a lot of,

2315
02:14:19.170 --> 02:14:22.500
it was a posh man's game.
Rugby it,
you know,
it's very thuggish.

2316
02:14:22.680 --> 02:14:24.040
It's a very thuggish game.
I mean you,

2317
02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:27.370
it's the only game I know of where a big Samoan,
you know,

2318
02:14:27.371 --> 02:14:31.290
it can like step on your teeth in a scrum and then he'll give you his hand to

2319
02:14:31.291 --> 02:14:32.850
pick you up.
It's just bizarre,
you know?

2320
02:14:32.851 --> 02:14:37.260
And they've got studs on the bottom of those shoes.
Well he's not good at.
Yeah.

2321
02:14:37.261 --> 02:14:41.690
So and,
and you don't wear it cricket as well?
I really didn't.
I didn't like that.

2322
02:14:41.720 --> 02:14:45.540
Minton no,
no,
no,
no.

2323
02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:50.190
Just just rugby.
Roger.
Exactly.
And um,

2324
02:14:50.490 --> 02:14:54.300
you know,
you can,
you don't wear any pads.
There's kit when you're,

2325
02:14:54.420 --> 02:14:55.320
when you're like 12,

2326
02:14:55.350 --> 02:14:58.980
it's scary when you're a small guy and you're the last line of defense as I

2327
02:14:58.981 --> 02:15:02.640
wasn't fast at fullback or wing and you know,

2328
02:15:02.700 --> 02:15:07.470
at 12 the differences between certain nations,
cause there'll be schools from,

2329
02:15:07.530 --> 02:15:11.520
from Tonga and Samoa and New Zealand and they were like big gnarly guys.

2330
02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:15.480
And some of them definitely weren't 12 they'd like reset a few years.
Oh really?

2331
02:15:16.610 --> 02:15:21.510
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Man.
These sandbags.
And they were just,
no,
no one's checking id.

2332
02:15:22.020 --> 02:15:24.030
Yeah.
But literally,
you know,
they would,

2333
02:15:24.330 --> 02:15:28.650
they would pull acts you and pick you up so you'd have all these and then the

2334
02:15:28.651 --> 02:15:29.430
pro,
they weren't,

2335
02:15:29.430 --> 02:15:33.330
it wasn't a professional game back in the 80s and you would have these,

2336
02:15:33.540 --> 02:15:34.410
they'd have real jobs.

2337
02:15:34.411 --> 02:15:37.550
Like there were lawyers because they were pushed that you don't even play that

2338
02:15:37.560 --> 02:15:41.790
in a posh school.
Um,
this doesn't happen in chef.
No,
it doesn't.
No.

2339
02:15:42.090 --> 02:15:43.380
And suddenly,
you know,

2340
02:15:43.381 --> 02:15:45.780
you'd know he's a rugby player cause he's my missing teeth and teeth.

2341
02:15:45.781 --> 02:15:50.760
He's a lawyer with missing teeth,
but drinking or like,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2342
02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:54.960
Cabbage years.
Yeah.
I mean Holly flower when you guys called Kabbage years.
Yeah,

2343
02:15:54.961 --> 02:15:56.860
we call them cabbages.
Cauliflower.

2344
02:15:58.080 --> 02:16:01.400
Cabbage juice is under those headphones.
No,
he's gotten paid ones.

2345
02:16:01.410 --> 02:16:05.160
He wears headgear.
Yeah,
I wear,
I wear headgear when I,
you're smart dude.
Jujitsu.

2346
02:16:05.610 --> 02:16:08.400
I have a little bit of martial arts background.
I mean,

2347
02:16:08.460 --> 02:16:12.390
I remember seeing you on these UFC fights that go around with my buddies and

2348
02:16:12.391 --> 02:16:14.460
wash and members senior on fear factor.

2349
02:16:14.461 --> 02:16:17.040
And I've heard all about these black belts,
but I don't really know the,

2350
02:16:17.140 --> 02:16:21.720
your story.
I started martial arts when I was a little kid.
And you grew up,

2351
02:16:21.760 --> 02:16:25.900
I grew up in Boston mostly being in town.
Right?
Fighting around.
Yeah.

2352
02:16:26.090 --> 02:16:30.100
Beantown going back there next weekend
minus one.

2353
02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:33.700
<v 1>Right now I think it is their buddy that used to run a store there called Alstom</v>

2354
02:16:33.701 --> 02:16:37.540
be in Allston.
Oh,
okay.
Awesome.
Great.
And then,
and moved it to Newbury street.

2355
02:16:37.550 --> 02:16:40.540
My Buddy Craig and I owns all the g Newbury street.

2356
02:16:40.541 --> 02:16:44.620
It's like the heart of fashion,
right?
Newbury comics.
Right.

2357
02:16:44.860 --> 02:16:48.570
We used to sell our storage in the Newbury comics.
Yeah.
You grow up in Beantown.

2358
02:16:48.600 --> 02:16:53.510
Yeah.
Mikey mock or I don't know,
Marky Mark Cuban.

2359
02:16:54.400 --> 02:16:58.540
I didn't know the Funky funky button.
We have a Saffie Saffie right.

2360
02:16:58.541 --> 02:17:01.080
It's like worked in south.
I used to teach a,

2361
02:17:01.130 --> 02:17:04.240
I used to be one of the trainers at the Boston Athletic Club.

2362
02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:08.290
I actually got to do,
you know Bobby auras famous hockey player.
How dare you.

2363
02:17:08.350 --> 02:17:09.370
Neither one of you fucks.

2364
02:17:12.070 --> 02:17:14.050
Marky mark portrayed in that film.

2365
02:17:14.051 --> 02:17:18.160
That was Boston sorta heroes that you guys make.
You make it more board.

2366
02:17:18.560 --> 02:17:21.790
Who's an excellent boxer?
Um,
so,
uh,

2367
02:17:21.880 --> 02:17:26.500
I worked in South Boston,
edit this a place called the Boston Athletic Club.

2368
02:17:27.970 --> 02:17:31.780
I was probably 19.
I got to meet,
oh,
martial arts.

2369
02:17:31.781 --> 02:17:35.430
I start fighting when I was 15.
That's when I got like really into it.
And I was,

2370
02:17:35.460 --> 02:17:40.030
I was finding in the men's division when I was 16 kicking ass,
I was doing well,

2371
02:17:41.490 --> 02:17:43.990
no,
no,
I wasn't really,
uh,
you know,

2372
02:17:43.991 --> 02:17:48.660
I was scared more than I was like ma aggressive and mean.
I was just,
I,

2373
02:17:48.661 --> 02:17:51.000
I get into martial arts because I was worried about,
you know,

2374
02:17:51.010 --> 02:17:52.960
people kicking my ass.
I just didn't know how to fight.

2375
02:17:53.090 --> 02:17:55.000
You want to start figuring out the ability to define yourself,

2376
02:17:55.001 --> 02:17:57.160
tired of being scared of everybody.
So,
uh,

2377
02:17:57.161 --> 02:18:00.220
I was a four time Massachusetts state taekwondo champion.

2378
02:18:00.520 --> 02:18:02.650
I won that four years in a row.

2379
02:18:02.651 --> 02:18:05.980
I won the US Open and won a bunch of national tournament's.

2380
02:18:06.280 --> 02:18:07.900
Then I started kickboxing.
I did,

2381
02:18:08.050 --> 02:18:12.690
but I started doing that as I was doing standup comedy and um,
I,

2382
02:18:13.090 --> 02:18:17.110
I stopped competing and then you gotta understand that you just a funny kid in

2383
02:18:17.111 --> 02:18:18.310
the neighborhood of my friends,

2384
02:18:18.370 --> 02:18:21.460
my friends talked me into it guys that I used to train with actually my friend

2385
02:18:21.461 --> 02:18:23.320
Steve Graham,
but I'm still buddies with to this day.

2386
02:18:23.350 --> 02:18:25.330
So it wasn't like you failed the new kids on the block,

2387
02:18:25.331 --> 02:18:28.660
go audition and figure it out,
go to stem it up.
I didn't even think it was funny.

2388
02:18:28.810 --> 02:18:31.330
I thought they thought it was funny cause they were my friend but other people

2389
02:18:31.331 --> 02:18:34.600
were just going to think I was an asshole because my sense of humor was just

2390
02:18:34.601 --> 02:18:36.520
laughing because he thought that you kicked their ass.

2391
02:18:36.521 --> 02:18:37.510
So he was just generally pretty,

2392
02:18:37.511 --> 02:18:41.710
I would do impressions of our friends like having sex or doing weird shit.

2393
02:18:41.740 --> 02:18:43.740
You know,
I w I was good at impressions,

2394
02:18:43.741 --> 02:18:47.710
so do these impressions of people that we knew and I would make people laugh in

2395
02:18:47.711 --> 02:18:49.300
the locker room and my friend Steve was like,

2396
02:18:49.301 --> 02:18:51.910
you should really be a fucking comedian.
And I was like,
look,

2397
02:18:51.911 --> 02:18:55.330
you think I'm funny because you know me,
we just missed,

2398
02:18:55.331 --> 02:18:56.740
he made them laugh in the locker room.

2399
02:18:56.741 --> 02:18:58.990
Had we not pick up on that what we're getting ready to fight.

2400
02:19:01.620 --> 02:19:03.960
Think case gallows humor as well.

2401
02:19:03.961 --> 02:19:07.480
It was essentially everybody was nervous and I would be the icebreaker because

2402
02:19:07.481 --> 02:19:09.990
we would have sparring days,
like especially on Saturdays.

2403
02:19:10.010 --> 02:19:13.630
Saturday was a scary day because we would do what we call team training and team

2404
02:19:13.631 --> 02:19:17.440
training was all the black belts would get together and they would pat up and we

2405
02:19:17.441 --> 02:19:21.850
would do these really long training sessions and they were brutal and everybody

2406
02:19:21.851 --> 02:19:24.610
would shit their pants and the locker room.
So I would be making everybody laugh.

2407
02:19:24.790 --> 02:19:28.070
I would be like the,
I express.
That must be,
I don't know

2408
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:33.070
<v 5>what's scarier there,
like a fight or a standup.
I mean that both of me scarier.</v>

2409
02:19:33.470 --> 02:19:37.640
Well physically,
but I mean,
yeah,
it's way scarier in all of the above.

2410
02:19:37.670 --> 02:19:41.060
The law of lives are way more devastating than the Joe Rogan story.

2411
02:19:41.270 --> 02:19:45.740
Past that point though.
So I still find,
I started doing standup comedy.

2412
02:19:45.741 --> 02:19:49.790
I stopped competing,
um,
somewhere around 97,

2413
02:19:49.850 --> 02:19:51.170
which is several years later.

2414
02:19:51.171 --> 02:19:54.740
I'm still training doing like fairy Smartsheet now while you still buy.

2415
02:19:55.090 --> 02:20:00.080
I've got an a la in 94,
[inaudible] 96 I started doing Jujitsu,
so 97,

2416
02:20:00.140 --> 02:20:04.790
97,
I started working for the UFC and then I got really into Jujitsu then.
So,

2417
02:20:04.791 --> 02:20:06.470
um,
I,

2418
02:20:06.530 --> 02:20:11.530
from 96 to today I've been doing two different types of Jujitsu and g and Nogi

2419
02:20:13.770 --> 02:20:17.330
meaning with,
uh,
with,
with the call Kimono,
which was like a,
you know,

2420
02:20:17.331 --> 02:20:20.840
like a karate uniform and it's like what?
Thicker a jumper.
Yeah.

2421
02:20:20.840 --> 02:20:23.070
You throw people around with that and you can grab it,

2422
02:20:23.071 --> 02:20:25.840
you could choke them within and see,
you could use it more like it,

2423
02:20:25.841 --> 02:20:29.180
it's almost like a weapon.
And then Nogi which is essentially just close.

2424
02:20:29.181 --> 02:20:32.390
You don't grab people's clothes,
no clothes.
You're wearing like a skin tight,

2425
02:20:32.420 --> 02:20:33.380
a rash guard.

2426
02:20:33.680 --> 02:20:37.370
And it's all about a wrestling techniques like under hooks and over hooks and

2427
02:20:37.371 --> 02:20:40.850
submission holds and stuff like that.
And so he's still fighting today.

2428
02:20:40.880 --> 02:20:43.760
I still know,
I just trained.
I mean,
I don't fight fighting,
you know,

2429
02:20:43.790 --> 02:20:46.490
competing is a very different thing.
Obviously you got to,
I mean,

2430
02:20:46.491 --> 02:20:49.340
you're competing in the gymnasium,
you go in your sparring.
I mean,

2431
02:20:49.341 --> 02:20:51.980
you're going 100% trying to choke each other.
Uh,

2432
02:20:52.010 --> 02:20:55.590
but it's a big difference between that and going into competition.
I,

2433
02:20:55.780 --> 02:20:59.720
I am of the opinion that especially fighting like MMA,

2434
02:21:00.110 --> 02:21:02.570
you should not do that unless that's all you're doing.

2435
02:21:02.910 --> 02:21:07.190
I think blackline and that it should be 100% of your focus because if it's not,

2436
02:21:07.250 --> 02:21:09.770
I think it was just wanting to someone and it is 100% of them.

2437
02:21:10.760 --> 02:21:14.490
They're gonna fuck you up.
So if you're out for a real spur to drive,
oh,

2438
02:21:14.491 --> 02:21:17.900
you're on the track.
If you're not 100% folk,
don't be texting.
Yeah,

2439
02:21:18.140 --> 02:21:19.530
don't be texting when you are a car.

2440
02:21:19.540 --> 02:21:24.540
So when did MMA and UFC sort of really exploding takeover the thunder of box and

2441
02:21:26.331 --> 02:21:30.530
what was that 10 years ago?
Five years ago?
About 10 years ago.

2442
02:21:30.531 --> 02:21:34.130
It took off because the ultimate fight are those 2005 when I came along,

2443
02:21:34.131 --> 02:21:37.160
I came along in [inaudible] 97 I was the post fight interview or this was like a

2444
02:21:37.161 --> 02:21:40.790
long before it was big.
We used to fly into places like Dothan,

2445
02:21:40.791 --> 02:21:44.030
Alabama and do these shows and these little,
what is your school?

2446
02:21:44.990 --> 02:21:49.430
But you know if you're watching him,
this is you.
We just had UFC one 82.
Wow.
So,

2447
02:21:49.431 --> 02:21:51.980
uh,
the next one's one 83 I believe,
which is,

2448
02:21:52.320 --> 02:21:56.510
makes a lot of events where you'd been with them as soon as five one no,

2449
02:21:56.540 --> 02:22:00.470
12 I came along and you have to see 12 but I only worked for them for two years.

2450
02:22:00.471 --> 02:22:02.570
It was in different organization,
different people owned.

2451
02:22:02.571 --> 02:22:05.840
It worked for him for two years and then it was just getting too crazy.

2452
02:22:05.841 --> 02:22:09.830
They were banned from cable.
It was really like more of a blood sport image.

2453
02:22:10.040 --> 02:22:14.730
Like people didn't understand what it was.
No,
it had rules,
but it was just the,

2454
02:22:14.740 --> 02:22:16.430
the,
the public perception of it.

2455
02:22:16.431 --> 02:22:20.400
Like I would tell people that I worked with that I was going some youtube back,

2456
02:22:20.440 --> 02:22:24.500
y'all brule,
and it was like I was doing porn.
That was the attitude.
They're like,

2457
02:22:24.501 --> 02:22:26.010
why are you doing that?
Like what are you going

2458
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:30.930
<v 1>to ruin your career?
But today 193 fights later today is much different,</v>

2459
02:22:30.931 --> 02:22:35.520
much different.
I started working for the UFC again at UFC 37 and a half,

2460
02:22:35.521 --> 02:22:39.330
which was in 2002 and you've done a mold since then have to most of them.
Well,

2461
02:22:39.450 --> 02:22:42.750
most of the paper views,
but there's so many events now.
I can't do them all.

2462
02:22:42.751 --> 02:22:44.760
Like there's Fox sports,
one events,

2463
02:22:44.790 --> 02:22:48.720
which most of I I'm doing the one next weekend.
But most of those I don't do.

2464
02:22:48.750 --> 02:22:51.880
And then there's fonts and sometimes you can,
he does them.

2465
02:22:51.890 --> 02:22:54.930
He's going back and forth about Porsche's with me on,
on,

2466
02:22:55.020 --> 02:22:57.150
on the interweb crazy guys.
The,

2467
02:22:57.160 --> 02:23:01.520
I'm sort of loosely sort of seeing visually that we're involved with,
uh,

2468
02:23:01.590 --> 02:23:04.050
what was the guy's name?
Dana Sunday.
Yeah.

2469
02:23:04.170 --> 02:23:08.850
He's the president of KFC and they were from,
well they have the beach guy.

2470
02:23:09.590 --> 02:23:13.080
Dana's from Boston and back in the day?
No,

2471
02:23:13.081 --> 02:23:17.940
I didn't know him until 2002 I met him when I was doing fear factor because the,

2472
02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:22.350
that fear factor start 2002 I think in 2001 2002 somewhere on.

2473
02:23:22.351 --> 02:23:25.900
How'd you go from being this Bostonian martial arts commuting guide?

2474
02:23:25.901 --> 02:23:28.590
A fear factor.
How does that,
I was on a Sitcom before that.

2475
02:23:28.650 --> 02:23:33.650
I was on a Sitcom on NBC called News Radio and that was on for five years in the

2476
02:23:33.660 --> 02:23:37.020
90s and you've come out to La to do the acting stand up.

2477
02:23:37.030 --> 02:23:41.820
Then I came out to La for another show called hardball that was on Fox that was

2478
02:23:41.821 --> 02:23:44.910
cancelled.
I got hired to the shows that it was a baseball show,

2479
02:23:44.970 --> 02:23:49.890
like a Sitcom about baseball that was canceled after like six episodes and I was

2480
02:23:49.950 --> 02:23:53.280
out here.
I already leased an apartment for a year,
so I was like,
ah,
fuck.

2481
02:23:53.281 --> 02:23:55.440
I'm stuck here for awhile.
I wanted to go back to New York.

2482
02:23:55.830 --> 02:23:59.440
Was this a bit like swing news?
One of my old time favorite movies,
like sweating.

2483
02:23:59.450 --> 02:24:03.360
In what way?
You know,
just people coming out to La to pursue acting.

2484
02:24:03.361 --> 02:24:07.740
And did you wear Mickey mouses killed for that role?

2485
02:24:08.940 --> 02:24:10.780
There was a lot of that skinny vins foreign.

2486
02:24:10.800 --> 02:24:13.500
You look at Vince Vaughn and swingers and you're looking at it on the day

2487
02:24:13.530 --> 02:24:17.650
different John fabree go a lot of booze,
food,
living the good life.

2488
02:24:17.651 --> 02:24:20.880
A lot of miles,
a lot of miles.
So how are you fall into fear factor?

2489
02:24:20.881 --> 02:24:22.070
How does that,
uh,

2490
02:24:22.140 --> 02:24:27.050
it was the same casting director that worked with NBC for uh,
uh,

2491
02:24:27.090 --> 02:24:28.890
news radio.
He just brought me in.

2492
02:24:28.920 --> 02:24:32.580
They were mostly interviewing like sports announcers and people.

2493
02:24:32.581 --> 02:24:36.210
They wanted it to be like serious.
And when I came in for the audition,

2494
02:24:36.211 --> 02:24:37.320
I was actually mocking it.

2495
02:24:37.350 --> 02:24:40.680
I was laughing at it and they thought it was terrible for the job because I was

2496
02:24:40.681 --> 02:24:43.950
mocking it.
And then somehow they realize like,
look,
if we don't mock it,

2497
02:24:43.951 --> 02:24:47.400
someone else better to have our own guy it as it's happening.

2498
02:24:47.640 --> 02:24:49.790
Can I just take it slash yeah,
go ahead.
It's fine.

2499
02:24:49.830 --> 02:24:52.830
I just thought it was ridiculous.
You know,
you're sick dogs on people.

2500
02:24:52.831 --> 02:24:55.470
This is the most ridiculous show idea of all talented.

2501
02:24:55.471 --> 02:24:58.590
That showroom for it just seemed like six years,
148 episodes,

2502
02:24:58.591 --> 02:25:01.720
and then we came back and did another seven until uh,

2503
02:25:01.770 --> 02:25:05.650
we did an episode where people had a drink come,
they had a drink,
coffee come

2504
02:25:07.650 --> 02:25:10.890
and that's what got to cancel.
TMZ found out about it.

2505
02:25:10.891 --> 02:25:15.170
They put the images on fucking giant beer.
Stein of donkey come.
Oh,

2506
02:25:15.550 --> 02:25:19.800
and the public outrage was,
but NBC was fine with it.
They had greenlit it.

2507
02:25:19.830 --> 02:25:22.110
They'd say,
they said that we could have the purple drink come.

2508
02:25:22.330 --> 02:25:24.100
How bad could it be?
Well,
it was,

2509
02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:25.840
<v 5>you know what man,
these people,
they,</v>

2510
02:25:25.960 --> 02:25:28.750
everyone wants to push the envelope and what are you going next?

2511
02:25:28.751 --> 02:25:31.540
Because they keep pushing and pushing and pushing.
Until finally they,

2512
02:25:31.560 --> 02:25:34.180
they don't even realize how far they've crossed the line until other people

2513
02:25:34.181 --> 02:25:37.690
react realities.
Blood.
Well,
I was telling them not to do it.
I mean,

2514
02:25:37.691 --> 02:25:40.630
when I'm telling you that it's a bad idea,
something wrong here.

2515
02:25:41.300 --> 02:25:43.930
There was two times when we did that show where I told people don't do it.

2516
02:25:43.960 --> 02:25:48.070
What was the other one?
Bull riding.
Yeah.
They made people ride bulls and I said,

2517
02:25:48.071 --> 02:25:50.920
this is a fucking bad idea,
man.
Because you're dealing with,
uh,

2518
02:25:50.930 --> 02:25:54.370
an uncontrollable environment.
You're dealing with an animal,
you know,

2519
02:25:54.371 --> 02:25:57.010
I don't care if you think it's tame.
That's not tame.
It's a bowl.

2520
02:25:57.100 --> 02:26:00.460
Just because you were corralled it and you figured out a way to rope it or put

2521
02:26:00.461 --> 02:26:03.520
it in a cake,
that's not a tame thing.
Tame as a cat.

2522
02:26:03.700 --> 02:26:05.560
You go up to the kitty cat and repetitive purrs.

2523
02:26:05.561 --> 02:26:09.400
It knows your person close rubs up against your leg.
That's a tame animal.

2524
02:26:09.401 --> 02:26:12.070
A dog's a tame out bowls are never fucking 10.
Yeah,

2525
02:26:12.850 --> 02:26:14.020
there will always fuck you up.

2526
02:26:14.170 --> 02:26:16.780
You don't want holes never come up to you to get pet.
You know,

2527
02:26:16.870 --> 02:26:20.200
they'll fucking stick their horn right up your ass and launch you over the top

2528
02:26:20.201 --> 02:26:22.540
of the arena.
They don't give a shit,
you know?
I mean,

2529
02:26:22.541 --> 02:26:25.890
we've all seen those images of a bull gorgeous.

2530
02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:30.880
The one where it goes through the guy's chin out his mouth.
It's like,

2531
02:26:30.910 --> 02:26:35.710
that is in my mind.
Why you should never fucking bull fight like that.

2532
02:26:35.760 --> 02:26:39.730
All run with the Bulls are,
oh,
that's the most ridiculous thing.
That's a real,

2533
02:26:39.731 --> 02:26:44.170
they say the thrill of running with the bulls like the fuck are you talking

2534
02:26:44.171 --> 02:26:47.800
about?
My,
the animals with testosterone,

2535
02:26:47.840 --> 02:26:52.840
giant balls and they're angry and they're running down these wet blood and

2536
02:26:53.411 --> 02:26:58.120
fucking beer soaked streets.
Everything's cobblestone and slippery.

2537
02:26:58.270 --> 02:27:00.520
And you're running to get away from these fucking balls.

2538
02:27:01.740 --> 02:27:05.880
<v 4>Oh
No,
I,
no,
I haven't done it.
I've seen it.</v>

2539
02:27:06.030 --> 02:27:10.560
Why is this one the concussions,
Ashley?
No,

2540
02:27:11.490 --> 02:27:15.040
you got a lot of stories.
These guy,
you've actually had a,
um,

2541
02:27:15.170 --> 02:27:18.840
well I've got a couple of podcasts lined up.
Um,
there's a doctor that's on there,

2542
02:27:18.970 --> 02:27:22.950
Dan told me about it cause he heard him,
but he's very into concussions.

2543
02:27:22.951 --> 02:27:27.820
And Rhonda,
Patrick,
that's him.
Yeah,
her,
her,
sorry.
Rhonda.
Him that's on the shelf.

2544
02:27:27.910 --> 02:27:32.760
Well,
Rhonda,
Rhonda,
man,
I've talked about transvestites earlier,
so,

2545
02:27:32.940 --> 02:27:37.800
<v 5>well,
no,
she's a woman,
but she,
um,
I took her to a UFC and uh,</v>

2546
02:27:37.830 --> 02:27:39.330
her husband is a,

2547
02:27:39.360 --> 02:27:42.150
he's a fan of it and I don't think she had ever watched it before.
Actually,

2548
02:27:42.151 --> 02:27:45.490
I dunno does Dan,
I don't know if he was a fan,
but anyway,
I,

2549
02:27:45.720 --> 02:27:48.090
I invited them cause they live in northern California.

2550
02:27:48.140 --> 02:27:51.060
So they came to the UFC and it's the first time she had ever seen it.

2551
02:27:51.061 --> 02:27:52.890
She literally had no idea what it was all about.

2552
02:27:53.040 --> 02:27:55.350
And after it was over she was like,
oh my God.

2553
02:27:55.351 --> 02:27:59.670
And then she went deep on the show into the dangers of head trauma and all

2554
02:27:59.671 --> 02:28:00.504
that's going on.

2555
02:28:00.750 --> 02:28:04.560
<v 4>Yeah.
I think,
was that the one that I was at where Anthony Johnson knocked a out?</v>

2556
02:28:04.561 --> 02:28:09.300
Um,
I would say that was an og.
Yeah,
that was brutal.
Nogueira yeah,

2557
02:28:09.301 --> 02:28:13.980
it felt,
yeah,
that was,
that was,
that's probably the headache the next day.

2558
02:28:14.420 --> 02:28:17.340
Oh,
probably still.
Probably still to this day.

2559
02:28:17.341 --> 02:28:21.120
It probably gets up if you saw that.
I mean it was,
it was actually,

2560
02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:24.980
I wish they'd stopped it sooner,
but yeah.
Well it was at one round knockout him.

2561
02:28:24.981 --> 02:28:26.510
It's pretty quick.
I mean it was just,

2562
02:28:26.540 --> 02:28:29.000
he tagged them a couple times and then put them away.
Yeah.

2563
02:28:29.001 --> 02:28:33.560
Johnson's fighting for the number one title contention next,
not next weekend,

2564
02:28:33.561 --> 02:28:34.940
but the weekend after that in Sweden.

2565
02:28:35.130 --> 02:28:38.780
Who is the big top dog guy now John Jones was number one,

2566
02:28:38.960 --> 02:28:43.520
just tested positive for cocaine.
Oops.
Oopsy daisy.
See oopsy daisy rehab.

2567
02:28:44.300 --> 02:28:48.650
People like to pause an amazing fighter.
Amazing fighter.
Yeah.
He's a crazy reach.

2568
02:28:48.700 --> 02:28:52.740
Pretty arguably the best ever at this point in time.
And he's only 27 wow.

2569
02:28:52.820 --> 02:28:56.750
My favorite.
Those Nick Diaz.
I love Nick Diaz fighting in a couple of weeks.

2570
02:28:56.910 --> 02:29:01.130
That's riding on January 30th in Vegas.
Anderson Silva.
Yeah,
that's crazy.

2571
02:29:01.131 --> 02:29:05.210
30th or 31st.
Now remember that name Nick?
Yeah.
Nick Diaz is,

2572
02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:09.570
he's just like personality.
Well No,
no,
no.

2573
02:29:09.860 --> 02:29:14.270
He's from Stockton.
I don't think so.
No.
No,

2574
02:29:14.480 --> 02:29:18.190
but he's awesome to watch fight and he just does it like nobody else stopped in

2575
02:29:18.191 --> 02:29:19.560
comp before she goes.
Of course,

2576
02:29:19.561 --> 02:29:23.060
I niggas can't park them in front of their house and then sleep.
Sleep.

2577
02:29:24.420 --> 02:29:27.740
Yeah.
Everything will be gone window.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And now he's just,

2578
02:29:27.930 --> 02:29:31.260
he's a good dude.
Yeah.
That's the problem with things like poor,
like I,

2579
02:29:31.350 --> 02:29:35.730
I posted an image of a your car yesterday and somebody wrote,
Oh,

2580
02:29:36.410 --> 02:29:40.250
in the comments of Instagram,
you know,
I hate Porsche guys.
They're all show offs.

2581
02:29:40.280 --> 02:29:44.650
Like how hilarious is that?
They're all of them,
but it's like,

2582
02:29:44.660 --> 02:29:47.600
it disqualifies you from ever owning one because you'll be a douche.

2583
02:29:47.610 --> 02:29:50.860
Like you can just enjoy the engineering.
You can do.

2584
02:29:50.890 --> 02:29:53.780
Even if he was just by yourself.
There was no one around.
You didn't tell anybody.

2585
02:29:53.781 --> 02:29:56.420
He had a Porsche.
You took the edge,
the car carver off it,

2586
02:29:56.421 --> 02:29:59.270
and just drove it around deserted road and enjoy the shit out of it.

2587
02:29:59.570 --> 02:30:02.630
You can't slip it.
Some people's views,
we'll look at him.
I mean,

2588
02:30:02.631 --> 02:30:05.590
I thought he was a rocker.
He looks at Dcb.
Right?

2589
02:30:05.870 --> 02:30:08.050
But some people say automate your husband.

2590
02:30:08.450 --> 02:30:13.450
Some people automatically associate cars like Porsche's factory a little bit

2591
02:30:14.181 --> 02:30:18.230
earlier on.
Especially here in la.
Yeah,
it's an image thing.
Yeah.
You know,

2592
02:30:18.231 --> 02:30:21.660
sometimes he's pull shoes.
Don't leave that Bebo Zip code.
You know,
you go,

2593
02:30:21.661 --> 02:30:25.110
do you ever take it to the Triton?
No,
I don't want to get it.
Chipped up.
A Guy,

2594
02:30:25.160 --> 02:30:29.090
a guy in a Aston Martin repeat and he was definitely an agent.

2595
02:30:29.930 --> 02:30:34.130
Definitely in Aa.
Hey,
here's all the wood writes a movie.
Tim knows he looked,

2596
02:30:34.230 --> 02:30:38.720
he was looking at his phone and he was on a Bluetooth.
You have a noise.

2597
02:30:38.750 --> 02:30:42.230
Well maybe you're an Asian in fact.
And on the toilet.
Oh,
can do on the toilet.

2598
02:30:43.220 --> 02:30:45.290
Well there's a lot of agents here so it's probably,

2599
02:30:45.660 --> 02:30:48.290
and it was like that time of the day where,
you know,

2600
02:30:48.291 --> 02:30:52.460
it's like we should be at work,
but you're not taking,
it's not lunchtime.
So yeah,

2601
02:30:52.461 --> 02:30:56.630
he's doing the meeting and the meeting,
well there's image cars and you know,
the,

2602
02:30:56.700 --> 02:31:00.830
the,
the big ones are of course Ferrari's,
a big image car,
you know,

2603
02:31:00.831 --> 02:31:04.220
that's like the,
probably the most obnoxious,
evolve them in a lot.

2604
02:31:04.240 --> 02:31:08.430
The Lamborghini Lamborghini is a big one.
Yeah.
They're so great.

2605
02:31:08.460 --> 02:31:12.890
Adjusts and three cap one two for like the Jeremy Clarkson always says,
you know,

2606
02:31:12.891 --> 02:31:16.820
like m three drivers are constantly on Bluetooth and that's the big thing,

2607
02:31:17.030 --> 02:31:18.860
you know.
Well as Jeremy Clarkson,
I don't know what the fight,

2608
02:31:18.861 --> 02:31:22.380
he hates Porsche's tool going to have images.
And I tell this story all the time.

2609
02:31:22.381 --> 02:31:25.440
I think anyone grown up anywhere in the world in the seventies or eighties,

2610
02:31:25.441 --> 02:31:29.460
chances are if you're a car guy,
he had a choice of one to three posters,

2611
02:31:29.730 --> 02:31:33.060
Porsche Turbo,
Lamborghini,
coon,
Tashana probably a Ferrari,

2612
02:31:33.061 --> 02:31:37.380
five 12 bucks or a Testarossa.
I had those of WM one.
No Way.

2613
02:31:37.381 --> 02:31:41.920
That my way without peanut one.
Yeah,
that was a cool car.
That was it.

2614
02:31:42.150 --> 02:31:45.140
47 and we're the same age.
Yeah,
I had that.
I didn't have one.

2615
02:31:45.260 --> 02:31:49.920
I had a model of that.
I had like a,
a model of it.
Um,
and it was a bas staff.

2616
02:31:49.930 --> 02:31:53.010
Remember that company?
They used to make,
um,
tape tape.

2617
02:31:53.070 --> 02:31:56.980
Basically it was a cool car.
The BMW,
BSF tape cardmembers members.

2618
02:31:56.990 --> 02:31:59.940
You pull that up,
dude.
You,
since you had that pull up at Vasf,

2619
02:32:02.160 --> 02:32:04.740
look at that and you'll be like,
that's a quite one.
But that was a space age,

2620
02:32:04.741 --> 02:32:09.600
car day.
But I look at it now,
it looks like those cars racing down the historics.

2621
02:32:09.630 --> 02:32:12.330
Unbelievable.
I I'm looking same GP at Norberg ring.

2622
02:32:12.510 --> 02:32:16.960
I like 25 of them rolling around the [inaudible] VASF yeah,
look at that thing.

2623
02:32:17.460 --> 02:32:20.170
I had that and my mum gave it away to some of them.
I left.

2624
02:32:20.450 --> 02:32:23.760
I said thanks a lot mom.
Look at that.
Right.

2625
02:32:23.940 --> 02:32:26.280
And you know what and VASF is literally,
you know,

2626
02:32:26.281 --> 02:32:30.540
tape tape the tape for Sony Walkman.
Oh really?

2627
02:32:30.570 --> 02:32:33.240
That's what I mean by tape.
You know,
I liked the fender flares on that day.

2628
02:32:33.480 --> 02:32:36.210
Did you love fenders,
aren't you?
Yeah,
I'm a big fan of what,

2629
02:32:36.540 --> 02:32:38.170
one of the things I love about uh,

2630
02:32:38.250 --> 02:32:42.300
like Jack Olsen's cause wide body fender flares.
I love those.

2631
02:32:42.440 --> 02:32:44.160
I love side to me that see evolution of,

2632
02:32:44.161 --> 02:32:46.350
I spoke earlier on about liking the 2002,

2633
02:32:46.440 --> 02:32:49.650
I 3.0 CSL Batmobile.

2634
02:32:50.190 --> 02:32:52.530
That to me is the evolution allows you liked it.
Nine,

2635
02:32:52.531 --> 02:32:57.531
nine three nine meister that a Rsr that they built because people always ask me,

2636
02:32:58.171 --> 02:33:01.920
do I like RWB?
I'm a big owl WB fan.
I don't like those.

2637
02:33:02.530 --> 02:33:05.940
A car is like the nine Meister Rsr,

2638
02:33:06.050 --> 02:33:11.050
like which is essentially like the gt two by body kit gt dude gt two with the,

2639
02:33:11.460 --> 02:33:16.290
with the bolt on flare.
Just an image for that nine,
nine,
three Rsr.
Find the nine,

2640
02:33:16.291 --> 02:33:18.840
nine,
three to four car man.
Look at the asset or that thing.

2641
02:33:18.870 --> 02:33:20.760
Click on that one that we just get a white one.

2642
02:33:20.760 --> 02:33:25.110
So you can see the bolted on flares.
Yeah.
Why won't gold wheels,
Oh yeah,
that's,

2643
02:33:25.440 --> 02:33:29.190
that's actually not even click on the other one that you were just hovered above

2644
02:33:31.140 --> 02:33:34.830
that right there.
Yeah.
That's the one that has the bolt on fender flares.
Oh,

2645
02:33:34.890 --> 02:33:38.280
that's a fucking beautiful ass,
right.
That,
that's Jennifer Lopez to me.

2646
02:33:39.550 --> 02:33:40.030
But also,

2647
02:33:40.030 --> 02:33:45.030
but also it's got Ronda Rousey on a guys fucking tires to Miss God that things

2648
02:33:46.590 --> 02:33:49.290
hold up my a STL and we'll see what Joe thinks to that.

2649
02:33:49.410 --> 02:33:53.240
Just punching Magnus Walker Seo or something like,
well,
I've seen that car.

2650
02:33:53.241 --> 02:33:55.400
I loved that car.
I love the,
uh,
the back end.

2651
02:33:55.401 --> 02:33:59.050
And I saw that person got just thing.
We,
uh,

2652
02:33:59.600 --> 02:34:01.430
Tiffany to Dell driving it that,
but just go to the toe.

2653
02:34:01.450 --> 02:34:04.560
There's a video of tickets.
I saw it.
I'm fifth gate.

2654
02:34:06.690 --> 02:34:07.640
So go back to,

2655
02:34:07.760 --> 02:34:10.070
remember I spoke earlier on about doing something with Tiffany Odell.

2656
02:34:10.110 --> 02:34:13.020
That right there for is uh,
oh.
Let's see that man.

2657
02:34:13.021 --> 02:34:16.300
Let me see that for the appropriate audiences.
Oh,

2658
02:34:17.210 --> 02:34:18.130
not your

2659
02:34:18.130 --> 02:34:21.520
<v 1>car was not overly um,
um,
horsepower.
It either.</v>

2660
02:34:21.521 --> 02:34:26.521
I mean it was a fairly reasonable to Tifton Dell pulling into your drive over at

2661
02:34:27.331 --> 02:34:31.420
horrible drive it from downtown all the way up to the snake.
And then he,

2662
02:34:31.540 --> 02:34:35.980
if you fast forwarded,
they pulled in.
Was that his truck?
No,
that was uh,
you know,

2663
02:34:35.981 --> 02:34:39.220
uh,
Jonathan Ward from icon does the,
uh,
Darrell [inaudible].
That's his,

2664
02:34:39.250 --> 02:34:42.380
that's his.
Oh Wow.
Have you met him Jonathan Ward?
No.
No.

2665
02:34:43.560 --> 02:34:44.740
You got to get him on the show.

2666
02:34:44.810 --> 02:34:46.990
We were talking about those cars that he makes yesterday,

2667
02:34:46.991 --> 02:34:48.560
that Bronco that he makes the,

2668
02:34:48.590 --> 02:34:52.960
I got on the thing and he makes those old cars and they look like old shit
boxes,

2669
02:34:52.961 --> 02:34:56.050
but they have incredible suspension unless he's derelicts where he finds those

2670
02:34:56.051 --> 02:34:59.770
old beat up Patina Chels and everything underneath these new mechanic.
Yeah.

2671
02:34:59.771 --> 02:35:02.740
But he doesn't do anything to the outside.
Well that's what's cool about it.

2672
02:35:02.800 --> 02:35:06.400
I don't think,
hey,
it's TIF working it.
He's saying here,
he's saying,

2673
02:35:06.401 --> 02:35:08.890
I'm looking for Ronan.
Hey,
same,
where's that gt two.

2674
02:35:09.160 --> 02:35:13.600
So they see sort of the inspiration for Alex's shot worx gt two right there a

2675
02:35:13.601 --> 02:35:15.790
little bit.
And how fast is this car like?

2676
02:35:15.791 --> 02:35:20.140
I mean how many horsepowers his car that he's driving here to 75 and it probably

2677
02:35:20.141 --> 02:35:24.820
weighs 2000 pounds.
20 to 50 so all steel know fiberglass on it.
Yeah.
Ah,

2678
02:35:24.840 --> 02:35:27.400
well if you wanted to get it lower,
you'd have to go fiberglass.

2679
02:35:27.401 --> 02:35:29.500
And how much lower could you get it?
Yeah,
not well,

2680
02:35:29.501 --> 02:35:33.820
you could go under 2000 which is magic,
but could you really?
Oh my God.

2681
02:35:33.940 --> 02:35:38.270
Why didn't you?
You pretty pretty much just have a all steel steel.
Yeah,

2682
02:35:38.860 --> 02:35:41.920
so the only reason why to go all fiberglass would be just for the weight,

2683
02:35:41.921 --> 02:35:45.340
but now you go cop.
But that stuff just cracks.
I mean I've had you know,

2684
02:35:45.341 --> 02:35:48.940
fiberglass fenders before on wide body,
you know,
old nine 11 it's,

2685
02:35:48.941 --> 02:35:52.330
and then it's just not the same.
It craps looks so excited.

2686
02:35:52.331 --> 02:35:55.900
This is the car that I sold at the good in your auction at the 50th anniversary

2687
02:35:55.901 --> 02:35:59.020
at Pebble beach area.
Do you miss it?
Well,
here's the great thing about it.

2688
02:35:59.021 --> 02:36:03.640
I have visitation rights to it and now reside in what I think is the greatest

2689
02:36:03.641 --> 02:36:07.990
Porsche collection in the country in Durham,
North Carolina.
I didn't look close.

2690
02:36:08.050 --> 02:36:11.260
Prodo tipo steering wheels,
[inaudible] old school.

2691
02:36:11.261 --> 02:36:15.740
Momo still blessing all the fat Momo.
Right?
Those are,
I actually,

2692
02:36:15.760 --> 02:36:19.830
I've driven this car three or four times in the past year.
Really?
Yeah.

2693
02:36:19.840 --> 02:36:22.960
North Carolina drove it down to Fort Bragg and then a in Monterrey.

2694
02:36:22.961 --> 02:36:25.830
I shot a video with Patrick Long and this up in Monterey,

2695
02:36:26.190 --> 02:36:28.780
so it's cool that I record.
Do you have to build them a new one?

2696
02:36:28.840 --> 02:36:32.000
I didn't wreck it.
I mean come on.
Who thinks that if you do,
yeah,

2697
02:36:32.010 --> 02:36:36.510
sure I'd take care of.
But you know,
thankfully I've,
I know my limitations it,

2698
02:36:36.520 --> 02:36:39.400
you know,
on the road and I never pushed above and beyond them.

2699
02:36:39.520 --> 02:36:43.940
Now what about bumper?
Yeah,
just see red pump right there.

2700
02:36:44.230 --> 02:36:48.310
Now what about um,
this car doesn't have any spoiler in the back.
There's nothing.

2701
02:36:48.311 --> 02:36:50.830
It's just flattened the,
does that become an issue at speed?

2702
02:36:51.070 --> 02:36:54.610
Maybe if you're all at willow springs going through turn eight flat out like a

2703
02:36:54.611 --> 02:36:58.540
buck 35 four one 40 maybe.
But on the street,
no,

2704
02:36:58.810 --> 02:36:59.980
it doesn't make any difference at all.

2705
02:36:59.981 --> 02:37:02.920
Like not all share wouldn't aid it in any way.
I mean,
let,

2706
02:37:03.010 --> 02:37:06.940
let's say you're on a freeway on a sweep doing 120 530 miles an hour.
Yeah,

2707
02:37:06.941 --> 02:37:07.774
maybe then,

2708
02:37:08.170 --> 02:37:11.320
but it's still fun sort of having that rear and move around a little bit.

2709
02:37:11.321 --> 02:37:13.150
And that's okay when it,
when you need to do that,

2710
02:37:13.151 --> 02:37:16.020
you can do it in the water called one with the big off

2711
02:37:16.250 --> 02:37:21.140
<v 2>dash is relentless in his pursuit of water.
Cool.
Except the water.
Cool one.</v>

2712
02:37:21.160 --> 02:37:22.130
Interesting little point.

2713
02:37:22.850 --> 02:37:26.020
The guy that shot these photos for speed unto Sean cling and half of it,

2714
02:37:26.030 --> 02:37:29.870
we're actually going to be doing a photo shoot with him in about an hour in

2715
02:37:29.871 --> 02:37:32.870
downtown La.
So really we're meeting him a three.

2716
02:37:33.530 --> 02:37:33.711
<v 3>Cool.</v>

2717
02:37:33.711 --> 02:37:37.440
Is that that that was the inspiration for our car and I'm having the same guy,

2718
02:37:37.450 --> 02:37:38.800
the same guy shoot it in the same,

2719
02:37:39.190 --> 02:37:43.670
<v 2>oh that's amazing.
So let's just 72,
a nine 11 right there.
And does the louvered,</v>

2720
02:37:43.671 --> 02:37:46.100
a deck lid like that,
does that have any function?

2721
02:37:47.310 --> 02:37:50.330
I mean it helps style,
but obviously it has coming out of it.
Yeah.

2722
02:37:50.331 --> 02:37:51.650
So He's full ma'am.
Function.

2723
02:37:51.740 --> 02:37:56.270
<v 3>I mean,
have you seen,
have you seen as new?
Um,
well it's not even finished.</v>

2724
02:37:56.271 --> 02:37:59.360
And it was like one of the coolest talked about cars at Sema this year.

2725
02:37:59.540 --> 02:38:01.660
Have you seen the one with the louvered flares?
It was at the moment

2726
02:38:01.890 --> 02:38:05.670
<v 2>on food from Fenn.
Yeah,
two years ago.
So where can I see that?
Is it online?
Yeah,</v>

2727
02:38:05.680 --> 02:38:09.700
you can see it online.
It,
what could they look up?
Jamie [inaudible] 67 str.

2728
02:38:10.510 --> 02:38:12.460
Let me briefly tell you my seem a story.

2729
02:38:12.520 --> 02:38:16.890
I'm sure you're familiar with Magnus Walker 67 this year.
Yeah.
Oh,

2730
02:38:16.900 --> 02:38:21.900
just go images minus could 67 s or t SRT SRT.

2731
02:38:22.330 --> 02:38:26.140
Magnus Walker.
Yeah,
just put mine in this war.
Oh Dude.
The top down right there.

2732
02:38:26.170 --> 02:38:31.030
Right there on the left.
So let me tell you my mobile one story real briefly.

2733
02:38:31.060 --> 02:38:32.200
All my sema story.

2734
02:38:32.560 --> 02:38:36.880
Two years ago I snuck into Sima on someone else's pass and if you go back to

2735
02:38:36.881 --> 02:38:41.881
that this year I got invited by mobile one to display to cause in the booth,

2736
02:38:42.131 --> 02:38:46.360
which had three cards.
The other one was a pro touring sorta 67 Camaro.

2737
02:38:46.361 --> 02:38:50.950
But that's just how crazy my life had become in the past two years from sneaking

2738
02:38:50.951 --> 02:38:52.330
into the Sema Show in Vegas,

2739
02:38:52.331 --> 02:38:57.331
which is the biggest sort of aftermarket specialty equipment show to be an

2740
02:38:57.361 --> 02:39:00.040
invited by a mobile one or from one documentary?
Yeah.

2741
02:39:00.041 --> 02:39:02.230
I never thought that none of this has been scripted.

2742
02:39:02.231 --> 02:39:05.210
There's no PR person behind it's men,
an iPhone se.

2743
02:39:05.230 --> 02:39:09.100
That's what I enjoy about 99% of the time.
You're a,
there's no agent.

2744
02:39:09.110 --> 02:39:11.520
<v 5>Your shop we made,
the way we met,
um,</v>

2745
02:39:11.720 --> 02:39:15.320
is my friend Todd Todd Mesereau who is the producer of my,

2746
02:39:15.321 --> 02:39:20.060
a show on Scifi a Todd is a Porsche guy.
He owns a nine,
nine three loves,

2747
02:39:20.090 --> 02:39:23.990
loves Porsches.
And uh,
we were talking about you.
I showed him the video,

2748
02:39:23.991 --> 02:39:25.820
we'd gone back and forth and he goes,
you know,

2749
02:39:25.821 --> 02:39:29.090
we're going to be in downtown next week.
Like let's contact magnets.

2750
02:39:29.091 --> 02:39:31.490
Let's go see if we could see his shop.
So he called you,

2751
02:39:31.491 --> 02:39:35.240
you answered the phone one time.
You guys had a conversation and we,

2752
02:39:35.241 --> 02:39:38.590
after we shot,
we just drove down and hung out with mangoes for a couple hours.

2753
02:39:39.670 --> 02:39:43.270
<v 3>I emailed him right before the Jay Leno show and right after,
and I said,</v>

2754
02:39:43.271 --> 02:39:46.430
is it still okay to come right?
And he's like,
yeah,
yeah,
no,
it was,

2755
02:39:46.431 --> 02:39:49.750
it was like Friday at 9:00 PM I arrived there,
but gay opens,

2756
02:39:49.790 --> 02:39:54.760
his wife was real happy and uh,
and then he's like,
oh cool man.
Yeah.

2757
02:39:54.790 --> 02:39:57.670
I was just reading about it on the cover,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And I'm like,
all right,

2758
02:39:57.671 --> 02:40:00.280
well go for a ride.
Yeah,
yeah.
You want me to drive it?

2759
02:40:00.700 --> 02:40:05.040
So I hear him wailing around,
well,
not wailing,
just puttering around.
Sorry,

2760
02:40:05.610 --> 02:40:10.450
putting round in the 4.1 gt three Rs and Dan,
who's in the passenger seat,

2761
02:40:11.260 --> 02:40:14.190
you know,
he was telling me later.
Yeah,
he's going like,
uh,
yeah,
just,

2762
02:40:14.191 --> 02:40:15.990
just one more lap.
Just one more lap.
Just one more lap.

2763
02:40:16.050 --> 02:40:19.530
And right before he got in the car,
right before he gets in the car,
sorry,

2764
02:40:19.540 --> 02:40:22.170
just going to throw you under the bus at bit.
He's talking to his wife Karen,

2765
02:40:22.171 --> 02:40:25.500
and going,
Oh,
I've just got some stragglers in that.
The last ones of the day.

2766
02:40:25.501 --> 02:40:28.800
I swear,
I'm just kicking them out right now.
You'll just kicking them out.

2767
02:40:28.801 --> 02:40:32.630
I'm kicking him out.
I swear I'm coming over right and 70 fricking laps later

2768
02:40:33.760 --> 02:40:36.490
<v 1>I got to throw out a promise to my wife Karen.</v>

2769
02:40:36.491 --> 02:40:39.400
I've been with her for over 20 years and uh,
yeah,

2770
02:40:39.430 --> 02:40:42.250
that's why I'm the luckiest guy in the world is I've got,
first of all,

2771
02:40:42.251 --> 02:40:44.610
she's beautiful.
She's my Georgia Peach and uh,

2772
02:40:45.070 --> 02:40:48.370
she just allows me to be this crazy fool sort of,
you know,

2773
02:40:49.240 --> 02:40:53.680
enjoying my life.
But uh,
without her,
I don't think we'd be here today.
So,
uh,

2774
02:40:54.070 --> 02:40:56.110
you're not hand impact is what you're trying to say.
Ah,

2775
02:40:56.111 --> 02:41:00.310
I'm just saying I love my wife and she's super supportive.
What I say,

2776
02:41:00.870 --> 02:41:04.290
<v 3>my wife,
my wife from my birthday before I even had a shot,</v>

2777
02:41:04.740 --> 02:41:08.730
this is what she got me was a set of the first Brembo GTR breaks do,

2778
02:41:08.731 --> 02:41:13.050
I could put on my really fast turbo and she helped me install nitrous lines when

2779
02:41:13.051 --> 02:41:17.820
I was,
you know,
drag racing that's fucking bad ass.
So she,

2780
02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.220
and she makes video games.
Sorry.

2781
02:41:20.480 --> 02:41:25.480
<v 1>Is there another way to take those naturally aspirated engines and get them to</v>

2782
02:41:25.671 --> 02:41:27.020
join a lawyer?
Is Powerful.

2783
02:41:27.021 --> 02:41:31.970
Is that 800 horsepower that you have in that gt two?
Is there a way?

2784
02:41:32.090 --> 02:41:35.150
I mean,
have we reached the limitations?
I mean,
no limitations.

2785
02:41:35.151 --> 02:41:36.380
Essentially on the air cooled cars.

2786
02:41:36.381 --> 02:41:40.310
He gets up to bike before 50 and it's like didn't nine meister get,

2787
02:41:40.340 --> 02:41:43.580
oh they got a nine nine three engine up to like 450 horsepower.

2788
02:41:44.210 --> 02:41:47.270
<v 3>I mean it's really pushing a round thing through a square peg,</v>

2789
02:41:47.330 --> 02:41:48.820
you know it or whatever there.

2790
02:41:49.390 --> 02:41:52.510
<v 1>I don't think you need a under the horsepower with the early,
uh,</v>

2791
02:41:52.720 --> 02:41:57.640
all the election,
whether or not you,
it,
I'm saying is it possible,
I mean,

2792
02:41:57.641 --> 02:42:00.290
have you,
I don't think you can get 800,
but then again,

2793
02:42:00.320 --> 02:42:03.400
I'm not building of a naturally aspect.
I'm not talking about it early car,

2794
02:42:03.440 --> 02:42:08.440
I'm talking about your car that to 4.1 you got up to five 60.

2795
02:42:08.800 --> 02:42:10.990
Yeah.
Like what is the limitation?

2796
02:42:11.500 --> 02:42:15.520
<v 3>Um,
so that's an interesting question so you can make more,</v>

2797
02:42:15.521 --> 02:42:19.720
but what's the delivery of more?
So we probably,
yeah,
we could,

2798
02:42:19.810 --> 02:42:23.410
we could bore and stroke it out to four point whatever we want.

2799
02:42:23.890 --> 02:42:28.000
You know what I mean?
Well,
how much 4.34 rehab.
It's,

2800
02:42:28.060 --> 02:42:30.610
it's being looked at in the maths being done.
The problem is,

2801
02:42:30.611 --> 02:42:34.390
and we've tried certain things who tried,
what happens is the Pistons get larger,

2802
02:42:34.391 --> 02:42:36.100
you know,
they get heavier,

2803
02:42:36.520 --> 02:42:41.520
then it stops feeling like a gt three and feels like a sloppy VA or Shitty VA.

2804
02:42:42.221 --> 02:42:44.530
You know what I mean?
Oh,
because it's more weight in the back.

2805
02:42:44.560 --> 02:42:48.610
Well there's more weight.
I mean,
think about Heavier Pistons Balance,
you know,

2806
02:42:48.970 --> 02:42:52.480
I mean you can add more displacement,
but how are you going to do that?

2807
02:42:52.481 --> 02:42:54.550
There's cost involved in terms of more weight,

2808
02:42:54.551 --> 02:42:58.240
more weight is the enemy and a gt three we'll call.
Yeah,
exactly.

2809
02:42:58.241 --> 02:43:00.310
You want to be revving part of the thing.

2810
02:43:00.311 --> 02:43:05.311
But that 4.1 is that I thought it was still a gt three like you get in it and

2811
02:43:06.131 --> 02:43:09.420
it's like,
it's still related.
Like it's related to your three nine.
Oh yeah,
right.

2812
02:43:09.460 --> 02:43:12.130
For sure.
Um,
it's like the GT two.

2813
02:43:12.310 --> 02:43:14.470
<v 4>So you could technically make a big,
you know,</v>

2814
02:43:15.310 --> 02:43:18.360
I mean the gt two doesn't rev the same way.
You know,
it feels heavy.

2815
02:43:18.361 --> 02:43:20.110
It's got heavier,
stronger components in it.

2816
02:43:20.590 --> 02:43:25.000
Joe needs to drive to 77 I think it does.
I do.
I think pissed it's raining.

2817
02:43:25.030 --> 02:43:30.030
I think you need to drive do and then you probably need an early car in your

2818
02:43:31.090 --> 02:43:32.230
stable I think.

2819
02:43:32.650 --> 02:43:35.500
And that way you can sort of see how the less is more lightweight,

2820
02:43:35.501 --> 02:43:39.160
smaller displacement work,
a little bit harder approached.
Again,

2821
02:43:39.161 --> 02:43:40.570
a thrill out of driving is,

2822
02:43:40.840 --> 02:43:44.230
and then you'll probably have the best of both world mentor me,
Magnus Walker.

2823
02:43:44.280 --> 02:43:48.080
How would just go for a drive.
So we're going to do drive.

2824
02:43:48.470 --> 02:43:52.570
You talked about Ah,
Alex and I actually talked about him building me a nine six,

2825
02:43:52.571 --> 02:43:54.610
four we talked,
oh that's a thing.

2826
02:43:54.611 --> 02:43:58.270
I want to build a lightweight nine seats for us.
Inspired.
Oh,
come to the right.

2827
02:43:59.110 --> 02:44:02.230
How light can you get one of those?
They're start out pretty heavy.

2828
02:44:02.231 --> 02:44:05.890
They're actually heavier than a nine nine three.
Really?
Why is that?

2829
02:44:06.330 --> 02:44:09.700
And it just the time period,
you know they got heavier and heavier,

2830
02:44:09.880 --> 02:44:12.070
so a lot of people,
they were sort of hated on a bit.

2831
02:44:12.250 --> 02:44:14.740
Now they're really popular because they looked kind of awkward.

2832
02:44:14.920 --> 02:44:16.600
They're in a weird middle stage,

2833
02:44:16.601 --> 02:44:19.000
which is my end of the road for the early styling.

2834
02:44:19.001 --> 02:44:21.400
Moving into the nine nine squared is a fickle on me.

2835
02:44:21.740 --> 02:44:24.880
He always likes to say it's full was the unloved nine 11 I mean you could find

2836
02:44:24.881 --> 02:44:29.530
them all day long and a 20 grand but now anymore those days of the tables have

2837
02:44:29.531 --> 02:44:33.550
turned and the technology was different than a lack of it I should say.
And it,

2838
02:44:33.551 --> 02:44:37.750
yeah,
it was just heavier piston heads featured this really,
really nice one.

2839
02:44:37.780 --> 02:44:42.480
Recently a white one that was like really radical and cheap history breastfeed.

2840
02:44:42.700 --> 02:44:47.590
I'm impressed bringing out the English flag.
He's an eye low file.

2841
02:44:47.870 --> 02:44:51.400
Is that what we call them?
We'll data that one that they did do though.

2842
02:44:51.401 --> 02:44:54.580
That one nine six four was very nice sex.
It really lightweight.

2843
02:44:56.490 --> 02:44:59.260
I think that the license plates had growler or something like that.

2844
02:44:59.290 --> 02:45:01.460
The thing that sucks though.
And this is the bus,

2845
02:45:01.470 --> 02:45:05.190
my buddy's car [inaudible] call the white one.
Have you driven that car?
Uh,

2846
02:45:05.191 --> 02:45:06.190
yes I have it.

2847
02:45:06.191 --> 02:45:11.191
What's it like it great car story without punching Alex is cause I got him into

2848
02:45:11.351 --> 02:45:16.090
the Porsche owner club and now he's become a really nine six four growler pull

2849
02:45:16.091 --> 02:45:19.160
up,
pull up growler.
Oh yeah.
We'll just punch in.
Alex Bermuda's

2850
02:45:20.810 --> 02:45:25.380
went back.
Yeah,
he's a local guy.
That's it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2851
02:45:25.870 --> 02:45:29.900
Oh is that your wall?
A No,
it's,
I thought it was just like,

2852
02:45:29.970 --> 02:45:31.570
this is a cool guy.
I actually got,

2853
02:45:31.571 --> 02:45:35.460
I was his first driving instructor with a Porsche owner club and uh,

2854
02:45:35.470 --> 02:45:37.290
he runs a Spec box there.
And uh,

2855
02:45:37.720 --> 02:45:42.340
my buddy Tyson Schmidt that used to work at tre built that car and then Alex

2856
02:45:42.341 --> 02:45:43.920
bought it from her and did his own customers.

2857
02:45:43.921 --> 02:45:48.921
What's that like to drive like one of your lightweight cars or two 77 pumped up,

2858
02:45:49.421 --> 02:45:49.960
these sort of,

2859
02:45:49.960 --> 02:45:54.960
these stepping stones to me that the in between two 77 and the gt three 3.9 but

2860
02:45:56.141 --> 02:45:59.230
as it as tactile as you're [inaudible] 77 yeah,
the whole deal.

2861
02:45:59.260 --> 02:46:01.180
The thing that really is faster,
it's fast.

2862
02:46:01.660 --> 02:46:04.810
A lot of those cool cars never really made it here.
Like the RS isn't it?

2863
02:46:04.930 --> 02:46:07.960
They had like an rs America.
It's not the same.
You know,

2864
02:46:07.961 --> 02:46:11.030
we had the one with the big fuck off wing on the back,
you know,

2865
02:46:11.360 --> 02:46:14.240
a plexiglass windows and you know,
sort of,

2866
02:46:14.990 --> 02:46:18.130
it's a shame in a sense that the state is never gets a lot of these great cars

2867
02:46:18.131 --> 02:46:21.020
and [inaudible] 73 hours never really officially came in here.

2868
02:46:21.060 --> 02:46:24.170
It is that because of safety regulations and they don't want to crash him I

2869
02:46:24.171 --> 02:46:24.910
guess or whatever.

2870
02:46:24.910 --> 02:46:27.550
You don't know everyone's Bill Gates or he doesn't want one maybe.
Yeah.

2871
02:46:27.870 --> 02:46:28.980
<v 5>Yeah,
yeah.</v>

2872
02:46:29.130 --> 02:46:33.150
Well this is a really interesting conversation and a lot of people,

2873
02:46:33.151 --> 02:46:38.151
I'm probably are ignorant to the joys of these lightweight,

2874
02:46:39.330 --> 02:46:40.500
exciting cars.

2875
02:46:40.501 --> 02:46:45.060
Like what you have and certainly to what you're building these extreme versions

2876
02:46:45.300 --> 02:46:49.310
of the,
the race bred nine 11,
you know,
they're,
they're,

2877
02:46:49.311 --> 02:46:51.940
they're fascinating cars and,
and it's,
uh,
it's a,

2878
02:46:52.130 --> 02:46:54.000
a group of people that enjoy them,

2879
02:46:54.240 --> 02:46:58.560
that it generates such incredible loyalty and passion.
You know,
it's,

2880
02:46:58.561 --> 02:47:02.250
it's really unlike most cars in that sense.

2881
02:47:02.390 --> 02:47:06.720
<v 4>Yeah.
Well we,
I mean you hadn't even,
I'd not even met you.
I,</v>

2882
02:47:07.140 --> 02:47:11.810
and the first phone call we pretty much had like,
I was like,
man,
he gets it.
You,

2883
02:47:11.850 --> 02:47:15.540
you rattled off all this stuff about gt threes,
you know,

2884
02:47:15.541 --> 02:47:19.470
and cause you had the 2010 and I'd had it.
So I'd had that connection and yeah,

2885
02:47:19.471 --> 02:47:22.350
you'd watch the video and I pretty much,
you know,

2886
02:47:22.410 --> 02:47:26.430
we just kind of riffed for like an hour or so after work.

2887
02:47:26.700 --> 02:47:29.310
You and I didn't want to start a brand new car.
That was a story

2888
02:47:32.570 --> 02:47:37.170
video.
That's it.
This video.

2889
02:47:37.440 --> 02:47:40.200
Well that video of the,
the green,
the Cook Carmen.

2890
02:47:40.201 --> 02:47:42.060
And you've never seen that video?
No.

2891
02:47:44.520 --> 02:47:48.000
3.9 gt Kermit.
Bear in mind.

2892
02:47:48.030 --> 02:47:52.550
It was done on her avid station back before we had high def cameras go,
Joe.

2893
02:47:52.560 --> 02:47:57.150
Interested throw up the video.
Got Sick Bitch Porsche versus Ferrari.

2894
02:47:57.151 --> 02:48:01.890
That's a good one.
It's smokes.
This,
this not even a stock.

2895
02:48:02.070 --> 02:48:05.400
Four,
five,
eight.
It's four 30.
It's been modified with 30.
Yeah.

2896
02:48:05.401 --> 02:48:09.540
This was on Saturday.
It was a four 30.
That's the new one.
Yeah.

2897
02:48:09.541 --> 02:48:12.660
This was back at Beale air.
They shut down.
This is how great is America.

2898
02:48:12.661 --> 02:48:17.661
They shut down Beale air force base so that we could film a TV show with Tanner

2899
02:48:17.850 --> 02:48:20.760
Foust and Paul Tracy.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2900
02:48:20.870 --> 02:48:24.210
And it was a show called the fuck.
What is she holding that with?
An iPhone?
No,
no,

2901
02:48:24.220 --> 02:48:27.350
she's not.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
She's doing the editing.
I'm doing the,
the uh,

2902
02:48:27.480 --> 02:48:31.860
she's driving Tanner and Tanner's Tanner's driving the green car and pull

2903
02:48:31.861 --> 02:48:35.400
Tracey's driving that one.
Look at that shock and we'll spin off that baby.

2904
02:48:35.430 --> 02:48:38.200
That's your car baby.
Just the green version of it.

2905
02:48:38.350 --> 02:48:41.670
Have 10 or I just saw you posted on names for God and that he's liking the GTTA.

2906
02:48:41.980 --> 02:48:44.680
Yeah,
he likes it.
Yeah.
So No.
Yeah,

2907
02:48:46.020 --> 02:48:50.640
that's the guy you want driving that fucking thing.
And Chris and Chris Harris.

2908
02:48:50.730 --> 02:48:51.570
Did you ever see that?
Yeah.

2909
02:48:51.571 --> 02:48:55.890
And Chris Harris Jr but 10 or files is a real race car.
I take a lapse with him.

2910
02:48:55.891 --> 02:49:00.720
Dude.
He's,
he's awesome.
Yeah.
A lot of people don't sort of give him credit,

2911
02:49:00.721 --> 02:49:02.850
but you know,
cause he's a drift boy or whatever.

2912
02:49:03.060 --> 02:49:07.110
But didn't he beat like Michael Schumacher,
race of champions?

2913
02:49:07.290 --> 02:49:08.100
I've driven with them

2914
02:49:08.100 --> 02:49:11.370
<v 3>like on the track in my cars that I've built and I didn't even know they could</v>

2915
02:49:11.400 --> 02:49:14.850
go that fast.
I didn't know that he wasn't going to use any breaks.
I mean,

2916
02:49:14.851 --> 02:49:18.780
he's an animal dude.
Doesn't use breaks.
It just,
just lightly.

2917
02:49:18.781 --> 02:49:22.770
Just to set the car up in front of him.
Yeah,
exactly.
I was just like,

2918
02:49:23.070 --> 02:49:26.010
you're coming in really fast as a wall right there.
And he says,
yeah,

2919
02:49:26.011 --> 02:49:29.100
that's really close.
You know,
as he's turning.
And he just just lightly taps it.

2920
02:49:29.101 --> 02:49:30.340
And we're flying around the,
well,

2921
02:49:30.870 --> 02:49:35.160
he compresses a suspension so much at the hairpin of Sears point.

2922
02:49:35.580 --> 02:49:39.060
And this was for a speed channel that the uh,

2923
02:49:39.090 --> 02:49:43.260
the front lip that I had on there,
literally it touched it and it exploded.

2924
02:49:43.261 --> 02:49:47.250
It shattered when we thought like we blew a tire and the guy that owns a track

2925
02:49:47.251 --> 02:49:51.620
says,
oh,
I've seen that a couple of times on a,
you know,
the cup cars,
you know,

2926
02:49:51.660 --> 02:49:53.820
and he's doing that on North Street car.
Yeah,
just compression.

2927
02:49:54.150 --> 02:49:58.800
How could that be avoided?
Can you not avoid that?
Raise it quite as fast.

2928
02:49:58.890 --> 02:50:00.640
You're not have Tanner Foust drive?
I don't know.

2929
02:50:00.940 --> 02:50:02.920
<v 5>Have you ever seen the video on top gear?</v>

2930
02:50:02.921 --> 02:50:06.400
The US version where he's taking this corvette,
z o six,

2931
02:50:06.610 --> 02:50:09.400
around this industrial area?
That was one of the early ones.

2932
02:50:09.580 --> 02:50:14.080
That was one of the Holy Shit.
Wild
animal.

2933
02:50:14.081 --> 02:50:16.500
The way that guy drives,
he's super the fuck he's doing.

2934
02:50:16.510 --> 02:50:19.690
It's so like precise and surgical.
The way he's taking

2935
02:50:19.790 --> 02:50:22.990
<v 3>corners on that TV show,
it was called battle of the supercars.</v>

2936
02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:27.080
It wasn't the world's greatest show,
but like I said,
they shut down a stealth,

2937
02:50:27.430 --> 02:50:30.320
you know this where they fly all the UAV is that kill all the terrorists.

2938
02:50:30.350 --> 02:50:32.120
That's where the operators,
Beale air force base,

2939
02:50:32.330 --> 02:50:34.790
like we weren't even allowed to look at in certain directions and there were

2940
02:50:34.791 --> 02:50:36.390
lines with people with guns that would shoot.

2941
02:50:37.040 --> 02:50:40.340
They would shoot you if you looked well on it.

2942
02:50:41.090 --> 02:50:43.400
Don't look and don't cross.
Don't step over this line.

2943
02:50:43.401 --> 02:50:48.020
Right and like secretly drama a little bit.
Yeah.
No,
well no,
I got to,

2944
02:50:48.050 --> 02:50:51.410
I got to drive the car with a u two spy plane taking off and I was like the

2945
02:50:51.411 --> 02:50:54.980
touch and go car basically and he's like don't get any closer or burn your

2946
02:50:54.981 --> 02:50:59.040
fucking paint off.
Yeah,
I would imagine that those jet engines,
yeah,
that's a,

2947
02:50:59.041 --> 02:51:00.200
that's a bad ass little ride.

2948
02:51:00.400 --> 02:51:03.510
<v 5>Gentlemen.
We're out of time but this has been a lot of files.
Emotional.
Yes.</v>

2949
02:51:04.180 --> 02:51:07.930
People need to watch your documentary if they haven't seen it.
It's urban outlaw.

2950
02:51:07.960 --> 02:51:11.230
It's available on Vimeo.
It's beautiful.
It's back deficit.

2951
02:51:11.231 --> 02:51:12.400
You're going to want to buy a Porsche.

2952
02:51:12.610 --> 02:51:16.150
If you do want to buy a Porsche and you want to get crazy.

2953
02:51:16.360 --> 02:51:20.980
If you want to get a a gt three sent it to this guy,
fuck it.
You only live once.

2954
02:51:21.160 --> 02:51:26.160
If you can afford to send it the shark work shoes that bitch up and you'll be

2955
02:51:26.650 --> 02:51:30.030
flying and no time.
Thank you,
gentlemen.
Really appreciate it.
You are fun.
