00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches to play devil's advocate or the,</v>

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:05.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3
00:00:05.611 --> 00:00:06.660
<v Speaker 1>the argument against it.</v>

4
00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:07.620
<v Speaker 1>Like what about things like,</v>

5
00:00:07.621 --> 00:00:07.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6
00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:09.180
<v Speaker 1>the serious situation,</v>

7
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.910
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was Chevrolet had um,</v>

8
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.750
<v Speaker 1>some ignition issues that they knew about where cars were cutting out and it</v>

9
00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:20.490
<v Speaker 1>caused a bunch of deaths and a lot of people were aware of this issue,</v>

10
00:00:20.491 --> 00:00:24.780
<v Speaker 1>but they knew that a recall would be incredibly expensive and they drag their</v>

11
00:00:24.781 --> 00:00:28.350
<v Speaker 1>heels and they didn't do anything about it for a long time and now it's just a</v>

12
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:31.590
<v Speaker 1>fucking complete disaster and they're getting sued like crazy.</v>

13
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:32.120
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

14
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.330
<v Speaker 1>what about that kind of situation?</v>

15
00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:34.940
<v Speaker 1>Like it's kind of important to have wars.</v>

16
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

17
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.730
<v Speaker 2>obviously the balance,</v>

18
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.043
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

19
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.510
<v Speaker 2>do you have an army?</v>

20
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.463
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

21
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.330
<v Speaker 2>Do you invade Canada?</v>

22
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.553
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

23
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.390
<v Speaker 2>Do you have police?</v>

24
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.373
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

25
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.490
<v Speaker 2>Do they shoot every person darker than them walking down the sidewalk?</v>

26
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:54.683
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

27
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.550
<v Speaker 2>Do you have lawyers?</v>

28
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.473
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

29
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.360
<v Speaker 2>Do you have shitloads of lawyers that are suing everyone?</v>

30
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.560
<v Speaker 2>All the time?</v>

31
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.400
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

32
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.641
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

33
00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:03.660
<v Speaker 2>so there's,</v>

34
00:01:03.661 --> 00:01:05.190
<v Speaker 2>you know the balance.</v>

35
00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:06.270
<v Speaker 2>There's reasons to sue.</v>

36
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

37
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.880
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

38
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.900
<v Speaker 2>you know the Ford Pinto,</v>

39
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.050
<v Speaker 2>I had two of my best friends died about three miles from here in a pinto station</v>

40
00:01:20.161 --> 00:01:23.400
<v Speaker 2>wagon that was in an accident and burst into flames.</v>

41
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

42
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.050
<v Speaker 1>Does the classic story that we had all heard.</v>

43
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

44
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.700
<v Speaker 1>You actually knew people like</v>

45
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.870
<v Speaker 2>Robert [inaudible] from way back,</v>

46
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.970
<v Speaker 2>fuck going to Csun,</v>

47
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.460
<v Speaker 2>God damn car carpooling together.</v>

48
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.030
<v Speaker 2>Crazy like 18 just rear ended,</v>

49
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.700
<v Speaker 2>two cars banged up next to him,</v>

50
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:46.660
<v Speaker 2>like couldn't get out.</v>

51
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.280
<v Speaker 2>Whole car just went up.</v>

52
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.263
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

53
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.223
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

54
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.341
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

55
00:01:51.341 --> 00:01:52.174
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

56
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.590
<v Speaker 2>He always wonder like what,</v>

57
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.160
<v Speaker 2>what would have those guys gone on to,</v>

58
00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.960
<v Speaker 2>what could they have done?</v>

59
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.380
<v Speaker 2>And it's also weird that even though they died when they were 18 they're still</v>

60
00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:06.130
<v Speaker 2>always my age,</v>

61
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.540
<v Speaker 2>whatever age I am,</v>

62
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.060
<v Speaker 2>which is a weird thing.</v>

63
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.500
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

64
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.670
<v Speaker 2>it was in and it's one of those,</v>

65
00:02:15.671 --> 00:02:20.671
<v Speaker 2>in that case there needed to be lawyers and Ford knew about it.</v>

66
00:02:21.311 --> 00:02:22.144
<v Speaker 2>And for dot,</v>

67
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.983
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

68
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.510
<v Speaker 2>let Robert and Lenny died.</v>

69
00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:26.950
<v Speaker 2>It'll be cheaper than recalling,</v>

70
00:02:26.951 --> 00:02:27.784
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

71
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.220
<v Speaker 2>2.7 million units or whatever,</v>

72
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.120
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was.</v>

73
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.463
<v Speaker 2>And outfitting them.</v>

74
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.520
<v Speaker 1>I think just whack.</v>

75
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.011
<v Speaker 1>We'd,</v>

76
00:02:34.011 --> 00:02:36.670
<v Speaker 1>there's Mexican dirt weed to Shitty weed.</v>

77
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.003
<v Speaker 1>Thai stick.</v>

78
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

79
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.640
<v Speaker 1>but it's all weed.</v>

80
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:40.570
<v Speaker 1>But he gave me some,</v>

81
00:02:40.571 --> 00:02:42.730
<v Speaker 1>and I play golf with my grandma,</v>

82
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.090
<v Speaker 1>my aunt the next day and apply whole five.</v>

83
00:02:46.091 --> 00:02:47.440
<v Speaker 1>I was like just coming down.</v>

84
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.130
<v Speaker 1>I realized when we were hitting the guard and she's a conservative person,</v>

85
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.810
<v Speaker 1>her husband is like a lawyer and like it's conservative so that it's like once I</v>

86
00:02:55.811 --> 00:02:56.531
<v Speaker 1>realized I was high,</v>

87
00:02:56.531 --> 00:02:59.470
<v Speaker 1>it was like keep your mouth shut dude.</v>

88
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.270
<v Speaker 1>But if you get that wave right,</v>

89
00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:05.410
<v Speaker 1>like the other night Aubrey and I were playing pool and um,</v>

90
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't really play that much anymore,</v>

91
00:03:06.851 --> 00:03:07.001
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

92
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:07.601
<v Speaker 1>I don't get a chance.</v>

93
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:09.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't play in tournaments anymore.</v>

94
00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:10.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't get a chance to play too many.</v>

95
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes dom Arrera nine we'll get together or Greg Fitzsimmons place</v>

96
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:14.651
<v Speaker 1>pretty good.</v>

97
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:15.120
<v Speaker 1>We'll get together.</v>

98
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.890
<v Speaker 1>You played pretty good and we'll get together and knocks the balls around.</v>

99
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.810
<v Speaker 1>But I'm not like playing like real players.</v>

100
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:21.370
<v Speaker 1>I can tournaments or anything anymore.</v>

101
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:22.561
<v Speaker 1>And so I think,</v>

102
00:03:22.561 --> 00:03:26.620
<v Speaker 1>but every now and then like you get high and you remember what to do.</v>

103
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 1>You remember how to do it?</v>

104
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.983
<v Speaker 1>The other day I got into,</v>

105
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.570
<v Speaker 1>I got zone for like five,</v>

106
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Speaker 1>six shots in a row.</v>

107
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 1>I started like,</v>

108
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.820
<v Speaker 1>I started running out like this table I should getting out over and over and</v>

109
00:03:36.821 --> 00:03:39.310
<v Speaker 1>over again and the way that I really shouldn't be able to do because I'm really</v>

110
00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:40.660
<v Speaker 1>not practicing that much,</v>

111
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.250
<v Speaker 1>but I just got into the zone.</v>

112
00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:43.120
<v Speaker 1>It was very temporary.</v>

113
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:43.811
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't hold it,</v>

114
00:03:43.811 --> 00:03:45.040
<v Speaker 1>but I knew it was all the weed.</v>

115
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.761
<v Speaker 1>I knew it.</v>

116
00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:47.380
<v Speaker 1>I know like I know how to play pool a little bit,</v>

117
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.900
<v Speaker 1>but I'm in this crazy sensitive zone.</v>

118
00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:51.910
<v Speaker 1>Why know how to control that ball better?</v>

119
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.680
<v Speaker 1>It's two ways it can hit you by two on basketball and sometimes in basketball</v>

120
00:03:56.681 --> 00:03:58.990
<v Speaker 1>it's like someone will throw you a pass and Walton the area go,</v>

121
00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.470
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

122
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.400
<v Speaker 1>what am I options here?</v>

123
00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 1>When the ball gets to me,</v>

124
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.590
<v Speaker 1>I got him cutting.</v>

125
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.680
<v Speaker 1>I could pass the him,</v>

126
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.870
<v Speaker 1>I could shoot,</v>

127
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.030
<v Speaker 1>I could pass it back and it's like,</v>

128
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.361
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

129
00:04:07.361 --> 00:04:07.661
<v Speaker 1>I'm ready.</v>

130
00:04:07.661 --> 00:04:09.190
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm right and then the ball comes to you.</v>

131
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.110
<v Speaker 1>Other Times that ball just hits you in the face.</v>

132
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.670
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

133
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.710
<v Speaker 1>why are you playing high?</v>

134
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:20.860
<v Speaker 1>It's so true.</v>

135
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:22.121
<v Speaker 3>Where cats,</v>

136
00:04:22.121 --> 00:04:22.611
<v Speaker 3>our pets,</v>

137
00:04:22.611 --> 00:04:22.820
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

138
00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.720
<v Speaker 3>you stop smelling cats' litter boxes.</v>

139
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.560
<v Speaker 3>I just put down my cat that I talked about last time I was on the show and for</v>

140
00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:31.510
<v Speaker 3>my first time in 17 years,</v>

141
00:04:31.511 --> 00:04:34.660
<v Speaker 3>I get to have a house that has no litter box and I don't even know what that's</v>

142
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:35.000
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

143
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.950
<v Speaker 3>You're lazy too.</v>

144
00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:36.784
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you can</v>

145
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:39.603
<v Speaker 3>do it every day.</v>

146
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.060
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

158
00:04:51.221 --> 00:04:51.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a man.</v>

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.031
<v Speaker 3>It's not good.</v>

166
00:04:58.031 --> 00:04:59.680
<v Speaker 3>It's really bad.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And you can't choose who you get to.</v>

170
00:05:05.891 --> 00:05:06.611

00:05:06.611 --> 00:05:07.090
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

172
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.421
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

173
00:05:07.421 --> 00:05:08.650
<v Speaker 3>There's like a few different companies,</v>

174
00:05:08.651 --> 00:05:09.221
<v Speaker 3>but when I did,</v>

175

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.870
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

180
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.540
<v Speaker 3>Why wouldn't you at least do a fine Yelp review?</v>

181
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.740
<v Speaker 3>It said 99 bucks.</v>

182
00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:23.590
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't really thinking into it and like I didn't think like,</v>

183
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.100
<v Speaker 3>oh wait,</v>

184
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.730
<v Speaker 3>I have to watch them clean because I made it and I'm like one of the guys that</v>

185
00:05:27.731 --> 00:05:29.110
<v Speaker 3>hides cause I'm so ashamed.</v>

186
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.080
<v Speaker 3>But then like you just kind of stand there in the kitchen going up.</v>

187
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.973
<v Speaker 3>If she's topless,</v>

188
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.941
<v Speaker 3>this is stupid.</v>

189
00:05:33.941 --> 00:05:34.774
<v Speaker 3>What am I doing this?</v>

190
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.900
<v Speaker 3>She really cleaning or do a bad job.</v>

191
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:38.061
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

192
00:05:38.061 --> 00:05:38.270
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

193
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.591
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

194
00:05:38.591 --> 00:05:39.400
<v Speaker 3>they're just doing,</v>

195
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.820
<v Speaker 3>they're just regular mates that are getting an extra 20 bucks to take their top</v>

196
00:05:42.821 --> 00:05:44.260
<v Speaker 3>off I think because these are,</v>

197
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:45.550
<v Speaker 3>these are people that are like,</v>

198
00:05:45.551 --> 00:05:48.640
<v Speaker 3>they seem like they were related and it seemed like just normal mate.</v>

199
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:49.360
<v Speaker 3>It was very,</v>

200
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.200
<v Speaker 3>very uncomfortable.</v>

201
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:51.750
<v Speaker 3>I kind of like it.</v>

202
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:52.810
<v Speaker 3>I felt very bad</v>

203
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:55.960
<v Speaker 3>because it was like sad.</v>

204
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.530
<v Speaker 3>This was an older woman,</v>

205
00:05:57.531 --> 00:05:58.364
<v Speaker 3>like how old?</v>

206
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.320
<v Speaker 3>50 and maybe hit her daughter.</v>

207
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:01.430
<v Speaker 3>That's was maybe,</v>

208
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.200
<v Speaker 3>are you sure with your daughter?</v>

209
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.090
<v Speaker 3>It seemed like a mom and daughter.</v>

210
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.710
<v Speaker 3>It was really fucked up.</v>

211
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.573
<v Speaker 3>That's tough.</v>

212
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:08.511
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

213
00:06:08.511 --> 00:06:08.751
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

214
00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:11.720
<v Speaker 3>you gotta think if you know someone that's really fucked up and they have a kid,</v>

215
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.900
<v Speaker 3>that kid's going to grow up with a fucked up parent.</v>

216
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.850
<v Speaker 3>Like if someone's like really crazy or you know,</v>

217
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.970
<v Speaker 3>if someone is a top was made for living and they don't think there's anything</v>

218
00:06:19.971 --> 00:06:21.350
<v Speaker 3>wrong with it and then you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I want to join.</v>

222
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.530
<v Speaker 3>The top was made business.</v>

223
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:25.131
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

224
00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:25.371

<v Speaker 3>it's good enough for me.</v>

226
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.320
<v Speaker 3>Why isn't it good enough for you?</v>

227
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:27.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

228
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:28.670
<v Speaker 3>the mom was a little,</v>

229
00:06:28.671 --> 00:06:29.150
<v Speaker 3>oh true.</v>

230
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.750
<v Speaker 3>Very true.</v>

231
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.100
<v Speaker 3>Then mine was a little overweight,</v>

232
00:06:31.101 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Speaker 3>but she had humongous Mexican tits and when she took her bra off,</v>

233
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.970
<v Speaker 3>it had the most horrific stretch marks from our broad digging into her</v>

234
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:41.380
<v Speaker 3>rotations.</v>

235
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:41.780
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

236
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.330
<v Speaker 3>it looked like talk to her like when she took her tits out.</v>

237
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:45.020
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

238
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.240
<v Speaker 3>I just sat there and they both just put it in a bucket.</v>

239
00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:48.680
<v Speaker 3>Like they just put their clothes.</v>

240
00:06:48.681 --> 00:06:49.190
<v Speaker 3>They didn't,</v>

241
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.100
<v Speaker 3>we didn't list it like they didn't talk or anything.</v>

242
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:52.911
<v Speaker 3>They didn't say like,</v>

243
00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:53.600
<v Speaker 3>hello.</v>

244
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.890
<v Speaker 3>They said hello when we came in,</v>

245
00:06:54.891 --> 00:06:55.740
<v Speaker 3>but they were like,</v>

246
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.470
<v Speaker 3>not any English or like,</v>

247
00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.990
<v Speaker 3>I just like the kitchen living room.</v>

248
00:06:59.991 --> 00:07:01.940
<v Speaker 3>I hadn't cleaned the kitchen living room in the bathroom.</v>

249
00:07:01.941 --> 00:07:05.840
<v Speaker 3>I namely let them go and you should have said huge Mexican tits or something</v>

250
00:07:05.841 --> 00:07:06.350
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

251
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:07.820
<v Speaker 3>They speak uncomfortable.</v>

252
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:08.750
<v Speaker 3>They speak English,</v>

253
00:07:08.751 --> 00:07:09.160
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

254
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:09.520
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

255
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.071
<v Speaker 3>barely.</v>

256
00:07:10.071 --> 00:07:10.730
<v Speaker 3>They like,</v>

257
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.670
<v Speaker 3>I remembered that they asked where the vacuum cleaner wasn't.</v>

258
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:14.210
<v Speaker 3>It was very like,</v>

259
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:15.740
<v Speaker 3>oh that's cool.</v>

260
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.990
<v Speaker 3>Have you looked under your huge Mexican?</v>

261
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.030
<v Speaker 3>I would always wonder like,</v>

262
00:07:20.031 --> 00:07:21.050
<v Speaker 3>what does that life like?</v>

263
00:07:21.051 --> 00:07:22.310
<v Speaker 3>I would have to ask them questions.</v>

264
00:07:22.311 --> 00:07:25.250
<v Speaker 3>I would give them extra money just to be able to ask questions.</v>

265
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:25.851
<v Speaker 3>I'll say,</v>

266
00:07:25.851 --> 00:07:28.890
<v Speaker 3>I'll pay you for a whole extra hour if you sit down for another five minutes.</v>

267
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:29.420
<v Speaker 3>Just let me,</v>

268
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:29.900
<v Speaker 3>how was the,</v>

269
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.250
<v Speaker 3>how was the daughter attractive?</v>

270
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.540
<v Speaker 3>The daughter wasn't bad,</v>

271
00:07:32.541 --> 00:07:36.320
<v Speaker 3>but it she was a little chubby or also like they were both a little chubby but</v>

272
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.930
<v Speaker 3>the mom's boobs were weird cause they had,</v>

273
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:43.310
<v Speaker 3>she had the huge like hanging ones and she was cleaning the kitchen and I just,</v>

274
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.200
<v Speaker 3>I would like just kind of walk in and just be like,</v>

275
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:46.310
<v Speaker 3>oh this is going on in here.</v>

276
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.780
<v Speaker 3>And it hurt just dirty boobs.</v>

277
00:07:47.781 --> 00:07:49.040
<v Speaker 3>Like touching the oven.</v>

278
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:49.770
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

279
00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:51.020
<v Speaker 3>while she's cleaning it.</v>

280
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.090
<v Speaker 3>You have made it sound very sad.</v>

281
00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:53.963
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing,</v>

282
00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:54.801
<v Speaker 3>it was horrible.</v>

283
00:07:54.801 --> 00:07:56.060
<v Speaker 3>I do not recommend it.</v>

284
00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.940
<v Speaker 3>I just would want to talk to them and find out what that's like.</v>

285
00:07:58.941 --> 00:08:01.250
<v Speaker 3>Like the guys like try to attack you.</v>

286
00:08:01.251 --> 00:08:03.140
<v Speaker 3>Like that seems like a dangerous kid.</v>

287
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.360
<v Speaker 3>I hope that's why they do it though because there's so,</v>

288
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:09.050
<v Speaker 3>they weren't very appealing and it was sad that I think it was like a onetime</v>

289
00:08:09.051 --> 00:08:09.770
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

290
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:10.760
<v Speaker 3>I would rather pay.</v>

291
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.080
<v Speaker 3>It was a one time for them.</v>

292
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:13.280
<v Speaker 3>I think once you get it,</v>

293
00:08:13.281 --> 00:08:15.410
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to have them come back ever again.</v>

294
00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:15.831
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

295
00:08:15.831 --> 00:08:16.040
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

296
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.000
<v Speaker 3>it's almost a joke.</v>

297
00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.010
<v Speaker 3>Almost mean a one time thing for you.</v>

298
00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:19.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

299
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.310
<v Speaker 3>I want to talk to them for that.</v>

300
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.170
<v Speaker 3>Would you?</v>

301
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.630
<v Speaker 3>I would rather do for 20 extra bucks,</v>

302
00:08:23.631 --> 00:08:24.411
<v Speaker 3>get regular made,</v>

303
00:08:24.411 --> 00:08:27.950
<v Speaker 3>but I could be bottomless and they would not like get mad at me.</v>

304
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.840
<v Speaker 3>Like I would just sit in there with normal mates and just have no pants on.</v>

305
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:31.521
<v Speaker 3>That'd be better.</v>

306
00:08:31.521 --> 00:08:32.354
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

307
00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.370
<v Speaker 3>I think that's illegal unless you make it.</v>

308
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:39.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

309
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.531
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm saying.</v>

310
00:08:39.531 --> 00:08:40.221
<v Speaker 3>The agreement is,</v>

311
00:08:40.221 --> 00:08:41.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to have where parents,</v>

312
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.171
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

313
00:08:42.171 --> 00:08:43.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure someone can do that,</v>

314
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:43.791
<v Speaker 3>Brian.</v>

315
00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:43.971
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

316
00:08:43.971 --> 00:08:44.840
<v Speaker 3>That's a great,</v>

317
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.210
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

318
00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.990
<v Speaker 3>you have to want to have your pants off with them too,</v>

319
00:08:47.991 --> 00:08:50.750
<v Speaker 3>so they'd have to be like these somewhat attractive.</v>

320
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:51.050
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

321
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:53.810
<v Speaker 3>You're allowed to stroke and just follow them around,</v>

322
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.980
<v Speaker 3>but they can't call it.</v>

323
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.943
<v Speaker 3>That's rude</v>

324
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:57.301
<v Speaker 1>in a way,</v>

325
00:08:57.301 --> 00:08:59.790
<v Speaker 1>in your little narrow hallway and accidentally come on them.</v>

326
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:00.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

327
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Like clean it up in this city.</v>

328
00:09:02.251 --> 00:09:03.240
<v Speaker 1>You could definitely work.</v>

329
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:04.390
<v Speaker 1>Workout your fantasy.</v>

330
00:09:04.391 --> 00:09:04.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

331
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

332
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.990
<v Speaker 1>That's a minor request.</v>

333
00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:07.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

334
00:09:07.261 --> 00:09:09.230
<v Speaker 1>You could work out some pretty crazy shit in this town.</v>

335
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:16.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
