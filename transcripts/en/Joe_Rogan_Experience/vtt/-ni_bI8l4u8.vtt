<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.250
<v Speaker 1>for people in Europe where it's illegal to sell vitamin B six in some parts of</v>

24
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.303
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

<v Speaker 1>so I can't really explain.</v>

<v Speaker 3>So 18 years I had been trying to,</v>

147
00:04:14.701 --> 00:04:15.534
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

148
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:16.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

149
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.040
<v Speaker 3>make somebody pay attention to the fact that CIA had been bringing drugs into</v>

150
00:04:20.041 --> 00:04:20.874
<v Speaker 3>the United States.</v>

151
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.833
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

152
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:22.291
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

153
00:04:22.291 --> 00:04:22.531
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

154
00:04:22.531 --> 00:04:27.150
<v Speaker 3>and I had lost a career because I blew a whistle on that and I'd been 18 years</v>

155
00:04:27.151 --> 00:04:28.770
<v Speaker 3>and I finally got a chance to nail the guy.</v>

156
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.530
<v Speaker 1>That seems so crazy that you're the first guy to come out with that.</v>

157
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

158
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.311
<v Speaker 1>I've know,</v>

159
00:04:33.311 --> 00:04:36.730
<v Speaker 1>I've heard stories before and I know I knew about the,</v>

160
00:04:36.731 --> 00:04:37.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

161
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.580
<v Speaker 1>the Mena Arkansas situation with a,</v>

162
00:04:39.581 --> 00:04:40.960
<v Speaker 1>what was that gentleman's name?</v>

163
00:04:40.961 --> 00:04:41.770
<v Speaker 1>Clinton.</v>

164
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Indiana.</v>

165
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.630
<v Speaker 1>Clin 10.</v>

166
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.250
<v Speaker 1>Terry Reed and the other dude,</v>

167
00:04:45.251 --> 00:04:47.530
<v Speaker 1>the dude that got caught that was over that Barry seal.</v>

168
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.071
<v Speaker 1>Barry Seal.</v>

169
00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:48.551
<v Speaker 1>That's the guy.</v>

170
00:04:48.551 --> 00:04:49.950
<v Speaker 1>He's the guy who died with George Bush,</v>

171
00:04:49.951 --> 00:04:51.160
<v Speaker 1>has phone number in his pocket.</v>

172
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

173
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

174
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.130
<v Speaker 1>that's a fascinating story.</v>

175
00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:59.131
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy who says that he was bringing in drugs for the CIA for a long</v>

176
00:05:00.431 --> 00:05:00.880
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

177
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.080
<v Speaker 1>right from South America.</v>

178
00:05:02.081 --> 00:05:05.500
<v Speaker 1>And they would have a spot where they would drop it off and apparently two kids</v>

179
00:05:05.501 --> 00:05:07.420
<v Speaker 1>saw it and these two kids,</v>

180
00:05:07.421 --> 00:05:08.560
<v Speaker 1>they killed these two kids.</v>

181
00:05:08.561 --> 00:05:10.390
<v Speaker 1>And then they said it was suicide,</v>

182
00:05:10.391 --> 00:05:11.260
<v Speaker 1>was the train track,</v>

183
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.453
<v Speaker 1>the train track desk.</v>

184
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.960
<v Speaker 1>So the parents fought for some sort of an autopsy and the autopsy found out that</v>

185
00:05:16.961 --> 00:05:20.830
<v Speaker 1>these kids had been murdered and then it just spirals into this thing on</v>

186
00:05:20.831 --> 00:05:21.221
<v Speaker 1>whining.</v>

187
00:05:21.221 --> 00:05:25.480
<v Speaker 1>But who would have ever believed before there was something like that?</v>

188
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.691
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

189
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:26.291
<v Speaker 1>that's a big,</v>

190
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:27.760
<v Speaker 1>that was a really big case.</v>

191
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:28.020
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

192
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.290
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

193
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.750
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

194
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.750
<v Speaker 3>I came out with it publicly after I resigned from LAPD in November 78.</v>

195
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.023
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

196
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.810
<v Speaker 3>and I resigned because chief gates was going to let me get killed and he</v>

197
00:05:39.811 --> 00:05:40.800
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't give me back up.</v>

198
00:05:40.801 --> 00:05:41.431
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

199
00:05:41.431 --> 00:05:42.091
<v Speaker 3>and it was,</v>

200
00:05:42.091 --> 00:05:43.910
<v Speaker 3>it was really six scenario.</v>

201
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.110
<v Speaker 3>I had perfect rating reports and all this stuff.</v>

202
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.850
<v Speaker 3>So then I resigned and then I went to the La Times.</v>

203
00:05:49.851 --> 00:05:53.340
<v Speaker 3>So my clock on being public started in 79.</v>

204
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:54.390
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

205
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.580
<v Speaker 3>but here's what's interesting about all of that stuff.</v>

206
00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:57.360
<v Speaker 3>You go back,</v>

207
00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.400
<v Speaker 3>CIO has been dealing drugs ever since before there was a CIA long story.</v>

208
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.821
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

209
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:03.950
<v Speaker 3>it's an economic issue more than it is anything else.</v>

210
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.810
<v Speaker 3>It's just something where they can't pass up.</v>

211
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Speaker 3>It's just too much money.</v>

212
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:08.180
<v Speaker 3>It's going out there anywhere.</v>

213
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.050
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

214
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.150
<v Speaker 3>and it helps them do things that they don't have to get approved.</v>

215
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:11.420
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

216
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.870
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

217
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 3>that's only part of it.</v>

218
00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.850
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

219
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.460
<v Speaker 3>you have to remember that Bill Casey,</v>

220
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.281
<v Speaker 3>Ronald Reagan,</v>

221
00:06:17.281 --> 00:06:19.160
<v Speaker 3>CIA director was a stockbroker.</v>

222
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.930
<v Speaker 3>The CIA was created by a,</v>

223
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.150
<v Speaker 3>the Dulles brothers,</v>

224
00:06:23.151 --> 00:06:24.770
<v Speaker 3>John Foster and Alan Dallas,</v>

225
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:25.700
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

226
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.560
<v Speaker 3>who were partners in Sullivan chrome.</v>

227
00:06:27.561 --> 00:06:27.741
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

228
00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:28.401
<v Speaker 3>they created,</v>

229
00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 3>founded the CIA,</v>

230
00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:30.344
<v Speaker 3>Allen Dulles is,</v>

231
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.440
<v Speaker 3>so it's the Cin Wall Street have always been one in the same thing.</v>

232
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.150
<v Speaker 3>And to deal with drug money,</v>

233
00:06:35.151 --> 00:06:36.170
<v Speaker 3>which one I wrote,</v>

234
00:06:36.171 --> 00:06:39.020
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the stuff that's in Rubicon is that,</v>

235
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.770
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

236
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:44.770
<v Speaker 3>you can move it with profits to earning ratios off books in a crooked economic</v>

237
00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:47.780
<v Speaker 3>paradigm and with price to earnings.</v>

238
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:48.080
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

239
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.670
<v Speaker 3>if you launder $1 million worth of drug money onto a corporation,</v>

240
00:06:52.671 --> 00:06:53.091
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

241
00:06:53.091 --> 00:06:53.571
<v Speaker 3>Gee,</v>

242
00:06:53.571 --> 00:06:55.790
<v Speaker 3>you as a price to earnings of 30 to one,</v>

243
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.390
<v Speaker 3>you've just created $30 million in stock value.</v>

244
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.700
<v Speaker 3>There's a huge multiplier.</v>

245
00:07:01.701 --> 00:07:02.300
<v Speaker 3>And the CIA,</v>

246
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.190
<v Speaker 3>this is all part of the same correct,</v>

247
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.580
<v Speaker 3>corrupt economic paradigm which is destroying us.</v>

248
00:07:07.581 --> 00:07:12.080
<v Speaker 3>Now that's the case that I started on then trying to find out what the fuck is</v>

249
00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:13.130
<v Speaker 3>going on around here.</v>

250
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.790
<v Speaker 3>How did you find out and did other people know and just keep their mouth shut?</v>

251
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:17.653
<v Speaker 3>Like how did you,</v>

252
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:18.740
<v Speaker 3>how did you know,</v>

253
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.870
<v Speaker 3>how was their like ultimate proof to you?</v>

254
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:21.410
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

255
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:22.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

256
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.560
<v Speaker 3>well when I saw it with my eyeballs was proof,</v>

257
00:07:24.561 --> 00:07:25.940
<v Speaker 3>but see how I got into,</v>

258
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.410
<v Speaker 3>it's a completely different deal.</v>

259
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:28.460
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

260
00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.110
<v Speaker 3>I have a special birth.</v>

261
00:07:30.111 --> 00:07:33.980
<v Speaker 3>My mother was a senior crypt analyst for the Army Security Agency in World War</v>

262
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:34.550
<v Speaker 3>II.</v>

263
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.620
<v Speaker 3>Her work product went to Secretary of state,</v>

264
00:07:36.621 --> 00:07:38.990
<v Speaker 3>secretary of war and President Roosevelt highest,</v>

265
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.310
<v Speaker 3>she worked on Japanese codes,</v>

266
00:07:40.311 --> 00:07:41.144
<v Speaker 3>the Russian codes.</v>

267
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:41.900
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

268
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.910
<v Speaker 3>My father was a decorated air force,</v>

269
00:07:43.911 --> 00:07:45.560
<v Speaker 3>a hero of veteran.</v>

270
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.110
<v Speaker 3>He was in [inaudible] World War II.</v>

271
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.680
<v Speaker 3>Then it came up on all this stuff and he both were connected with CIS.</v>

272
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.750
<v Speaker 3>I came from a CIF family.</v>

273
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.970
<v Speaker 3>So I mean I used to come home from grade school and,</v>

274
00:07:56.971 --> 00:07:57.530
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>

275
00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:57.801
<v Speaker 3>mom,</v>

276
00:07:57.801 --> 00:07:58.311
<v Speaker 3>what's for dinner?</v>

277
00:07:58.311 --> 00:07:58.701
<v Speaker 3>And she'd say,</v>

278
00:07:58.701 --> 00:07:59.534
<v Speaker 3>I can't tell you.</v>

279
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.910
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

280
00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:03.830
<v Speaker 3>Gotcha.</v>

281
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:04.580
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

282
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:05.350
<v Speaker 3>so anyway,</v>

283
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:05.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

284
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.320
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

285
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.480
<v Speaker 3>so I was marked and plus I was gifted,</v>

286
00:08:08.481 --> 00:08:08.751
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

287
00:08:08.751 --> 00:08:13.751
<v Speaker 3>I was a good smart guy and so I was being groomed because the CIA has people in</v>

288
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:19.100
<v Speaker 3>police departments all over the country and they have for years.</v>

289
00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.120
<v Speaker 3>Laura Nola,</v>

290
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:20.953
<v Speaker 3>that's what they do.</v>

291
00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:26.320
<v Speaker 3>So I was being recruited into that because I already had a cute clearance,</v>

292
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.210
<v Speaker 3>which I had had just from living with my parents.</v>

293
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.150
<v Speaker 3>And so that kind of marked me as somebody who would like on the inside,</v>

294
00:08:32.151 --> 00:08:32.984
<v Speaker 3>but I wasn't really,</v>

295
00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:33.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

296
00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.290
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't going to go along with drugs one when that's what I saw,</v>

297
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:37.040
<v Speaker 3>what it was.</v>

298
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:37.850
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't do it.</v>

299
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.470
<v Speaker 3>And everybody else who's just going along with it,</v>

300
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.220
<v Speaker 3>or do they just turn a blind dog?</v>

301
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:42.523
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

302
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:44.691
<v Speaker 3>how does it mean?</v>

303
00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:45.524
<v Speaker 3>How has it,</v>

304
00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:46.610
<v Speaker 3>how does it go?</v>

305
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.181
<v Speaker 3>How does it work?</v>

306
00:08:47.181 --> 00:08:47.690
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

307
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:48.710
<v Speaker 3>what happens is that,</v>

308
00:08:48.711 --> 00:08:49.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you understand this,</v>

309
00:08:49.911 --> 00:08:50.744
<v Speaker 3>this is that,</v>

310
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

311
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.840
<v Speaker 3>we w w we live in a world that's full of sell outs.</v>

312
00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 3>We're surrounded by sell</v>

313
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.441
<v Speaker 4>outs.</v>

314
00:08:56.441 --> 00:08:58.150
<v Speaker 4>We're surrounded by a,</v>

315
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.030
<v Speaker 4>and this came up really recently with,</v>

316
00:09:00.031 --> 00:09:00.450
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

317
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.360
<v Speaker 4>with occupy and my French and Mark Thomas and all this stuff that we got</v>

318
00:09:03.361 --> 00:09:04.620
<v Speaker 4>together involved with that.</v>

319
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:05.580
<v Speaker 4>It's about honor.</v>

320
00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:06.690
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

321
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:07.170
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

322
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:07.680
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

323
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.400
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

324
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:08.760
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

325
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.610
<v Speaker 4>some people just aren't capable of selling out,</v>

326
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.121
<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>

327
00:09:12.121 --> 00:09:13.290
<v Speaker 4>And I guess I'm one of those,</v>

328
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.660
<v Speaker 4>but most people resign themselves.</v>

329
00:09:15.661 --> 00:09:17.520
<v Speaker 4>And not everybody knows this.</v>

330
00:09:17.521 --> 00:09:17.701
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

331
00:09:17.701 --> 00:09:20.040
<v Speaker 4>not every LAPD cop knows this happens,</v>

332
00:09:20.041 --> 00:09:20.281
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

333
00:09:20.281 --> 00:09:21.600
<v Speaker 4>it's compartmentalize.</v>

334
00:09:21.601 --> 00:09:21.871
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

335
00:09:21.871 --> 00:09:22.704
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

336
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:23.663
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

337
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.180
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people out there in law enforcement and I think we've seen</v>

338
00:09:27.181 --> 00:09:27.511
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

339
00:09:27.511 --> 00:09:28.050
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

340
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:32.120
<v Speaker 4>with the occupy movement of the way veterans and some cops have responded to.</v>

341
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.730
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people inside the system who were really honest and they're</v>

342
00:09:35.731 --> 00:09:37.830
<v Speaker 4>just waiting for somebody else to show them how to do it.</v>

343
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:40.740
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

344
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.270
<v Speaker 5>What a terrifying situation.</v>

345
00:09:42.271 --> 00:09:46.620
<v Speaker 5>So you're the first guy to step up and you step up and step out and say that in</v>

346
00:09:46.621 --> 00:09:48.870
<v Speaker 5>front of all these people on television,</v>

347
00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:50.310
<v Speaker 5>what happens then?</v>

348
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:50.670
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

349
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.590
<v Speaker 5>I'm not so sure I was the first to step up.</v>

350
00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:53.480
<v Speaker 5>I'm like that.</v>

351
00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:54.150
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

352
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:59.150
<v Speaker 5>I was the first to do it and stay alive and the first to do it and find a way to</v>

353
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:00.780
<v Speaker 5>get shit like this done.</v>

354
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:04.500
<v Speaker 5>Do you think it's almost safer to come out with something like that than it is</v>

355
00:10:04.501 --> 00:10:07.830
<v Speaker 5>to be the guy who hasn't said anything and they could silence?</v>

356
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:08.431
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

357
00:10:08.431 --> 00:10:08.920
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

358
00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.570
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

359
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:13.860
<v Speaker 5>being transparent publicly is your absolute best offense.</v>

360
00:10:13.861 --> 00:10:15.870
<v Speaker 5>And that's something I've done for 35 years now.</v>

361
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:18.990
<v Speaker 5>But you got to a point in one point,</v>

362
00:10:18.991 --> 00:10:20.520
<v Speaker 5>were you appointed one point where you,</v>

363
00:10:20.521 --> 00:10:22.410
<v Speaker 5>where you were worried about your own life,</v>

364
00:10:22.411 --> 00:10:23.670
<v Speaker 5>like you left the country for awhile,</v>

365
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:24.593
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

366
00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:25.830
<v Speaker 5>Many times I've,</v>

367
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.840
<v Speaker 5>I've never not really been,</v>

368
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:28.350
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

369
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:30.840
<v Speaker 5>that you like one of those dudes like wakes up and hears something and just</v>

370
00:10:30.841 --> 00:10:31.890
<v Speaker 5>fucking packed your bags.</v>

371
00:10:31.891 --> 00:10:32.724
<v Speaker 5>He gets on a plane.</v>

372
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:33.150
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

373
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:33.361
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

374
00:10:33.361 --> 00:10:34.380
<v Speaker 5>how many times did you do it?</v>

375
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:34.661
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

376
00:10:34.661 --> 00:10:34.850
<v Speaker 5>Oh</v>

377
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:35.211
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

378
00:10:35.211 --> 00:10:35.640
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

379
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.140
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

380
00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.820
<v Speaker 4>you make peace with it.</v>

381
00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:39.710
<v Speaker 4>You have to learn how to live with it.</v>

382
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.113
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

383
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:45.500
<v Speaker 4>one of my training officers that LAPD had been a marine with the fifth marines</v>

384
00:10:45.501 --> 00:10:46.520
<v Speaker 4>in the citadel at way,</v>

385
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:47.301
<v Speaker 4>and he said,</v>

386
00:10:47.301 --> 00:10:48.500
<v Speaker 4>you can get used to anything.</v>

387
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:50.390
<v Speaker 4>And that was a,</v>

388
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.710
<v Speaker 4>that was a real teacher.</v>

389
00:10:51.711 --> 00:10:54.920
<v Speaker 4>So it's not that you can't live on adrenaline forever,</v>

390
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:55.851
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

391
00:10:55.851 --> 00:10:57.380
<v Speaker 4>so you make peace and then,</v>

392
00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:59.120
<v Speaker 4>but being public is,</v>

393
00:10:59.121 --> 00:10:59.860
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

394
00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:00.380
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

395
00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.840
<v Speaker 4>is always the best safety.</v>

396
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.790
<v Speaker 4>Why were you worried about your life?</v>

397
00:11:04.791 --> 00:11:05.990
<v Speaker 4>What was it specifically?</v>

398
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.900
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

399
00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:08.320
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

400
00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:08.870
<v Speaker 4>what I,</v>

401
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:09.531
<v Speaker 4>what I would have,</v>

402
00:11:09.531 --> 00:11:10.660
<v Speaker 4>what I was exposing.</v>

403
00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:13.940
<v Speaker 4>Now you have to bear in mind that when I was at LAPD and I resigned,</v>

404
00:11:13.941 --> 00:11:16.820
<v Speaker 4>I had pulled like the tail of something out of a hole.</v>

405
00:11:16.821 --> 00:11:19.280
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know what was attached to the rest of,</v>

406
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:20.030
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

407
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:23.090
<v Speaker 4>I'm just gonna pull on this one worm and Allston until I ended.</v>

408
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:23.630
<v Speaker 4>It's the,</v>

409
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:24.740
<v Speaker 4>it's the can of worms.</v>

410
00:11:24.741 --> 00:11:25.480
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

411
00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:25.730
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

412
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.770
<v Speaker 4>but clearly what I had,</v>

413
00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:34.180
<v Speaker 4>the CIA was directly involved in bringing heroin into this country illegally of</v>

414
00:11:34.461 --> 00:11:39.230
<v Speaker 4>using police officers in their pay or control with the clearances to protect</v>

415
00:11:39.231 --> 00:11:40.400
<v Speaker 4>those drug shipments.</v>

416
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:42.170
<v Speaker 4>And they were laundering the drug money.</v>

417
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:43.310
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

418
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:43.791
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

419
00:11:43.791 --> 00:11:47.720
<v Speaker 4>and that it had to have been known at a White House level.</v>

420
00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:51.560
<v Speaker 4>And that was in 1970 78.</v>

421
00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:52.550
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible.</v>

422
00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.460
<v Speaker 4>And they thought that you just keep getting away with it.</v>

423
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:55.330
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

424
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:55.631
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

425
00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:56.464
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

426
00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.260
<v Speaker 4>those who went in a rigged game gets stupid.</v>

427
00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:00.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

428
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:01.211
<v Speaker 4>Those,</v>

429
00:12:01.211 --> 00:12:01.291
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

430
00:12:01.291 --> 00:12:01.541
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

431
00:12:01.541 --> 00:12:02.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

432
00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:06.130
<v Speaker 4>it's always fucking playing your way and this and that get real sloppy.</v>

433
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:06.993
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>

434
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.301
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>

435
00:12:07.301 --> 00:12:08.030
<v Speaker 4>that's a</v>

436
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:08.720
<v Speaker 1>brilliant point.</v>

437
00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.070
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard anybody put it that way,</v>

438
00:12:10.071 --> 00:12:11.060
<v Speaker 1>but you're absolutely right.</v>

439
00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:12.380
<v Speaker 1>It's just human nature.</v>

440
00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:12.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

441
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:13.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

442
00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:13.471
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

443
00:12:13.471 --> 00:12:14.630
<v Speaker 4>and what I say now,</v>

444
00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:14.861
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

445
00:12:14.861 --> 00:12:18.290
<v Speaker 4>with the collapse of human industrial civilization as the dinosaurs are not</v>

446
00:12:18.291 --> 00:12:20.480
<v Speaker 4>capable of being anything other than dinosaurs.</v>

447
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.270
<v Speaker 1>Well it is certainly if you look at what we're doing,</v>

448
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.700
<v Speaker 1>why we're struggling at home so badly,</v>

449
00:12:27.701 --> 00:12:32.590
<v Speaker 1>we insist on engaging and all these things overseas that are pay strange</v>

450
00:12:32.591 --> 00:12:33.430
<v Speaker 1>dividends and we don't,</v>

451
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:33.761
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>

452
00:12:33.761 --> 00:12:33.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

453
00:12:33.941 --> 00:12:35.170
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing tangible about it.</v>

454
00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:37.000
<v Speaker 1>But tangibly in this country right now,</v>

455
00:12:37.001 --> 00:12:38.800
<v Speaker 1>like people were having a really fucking hard time,</v>

456
00:12:38.801 --> 00:12:43.801
<v Speaker 1>but yet all of this money and all these resources are going overseas to fight</v>

457
00:12:44.111 --> 00:12:46.120
<v Speaker 1>wars that almost no one agrees with.</v>

458
00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.670
<v Speaker 1>And when you look at it like that is just sloppiness.</v>

459
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:50.080
<v Speaker 1>That just seems sloppy.</v>

460
00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:50.790
<v Speaker 1>It's this,</v>

461
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:52.030
<v Speaker 1>it's so preposterous.</v>

462
00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:53.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's so without merit.</v>

463
00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:57.610
<v Speaker 1>Like if there wasn't some sort of a nine 11 attack and you propose this sort of</v>

464
00:12:57.611 --> 00:12:58.600
<v Speaker 1>a ridiculous war,</v>

465
00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:00.820
<v Speaker 1>everybody but like get the fuck outta here.</v>

466
00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.490
<v Speaker 1>But because of the initial nine 11 attack,</v>

467
00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:04.780
<v Speaker 1>because there was something so big,</v>

468
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.220
<v Speaker 1>they capitalized on it.</v>

469
00:13:06.221 --> 00:13:09.020
<v Speaker 1>And now they have written the bad intentions right into the,</v>

470
00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:12.270
<v Speaker 4>when you were on Leno recently with Ron Paul,</v>

471
00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:13.560
<v Speaker 4>I saw the great segment.</v>

472
00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:14.483
<v Speaker 4>I mean like,</v>

473
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:15.240
<v Speaker 4>Ooh.</v>

474
00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:15.571
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

475
00:13:15.571 --> 00:13:15.990
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

476
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:17.200
<v Speaker 4>but what I caught him and,</v>

477
00:13:17.201 --> 00:13:17.960
<v Speaker 4>and I've been doing it.</v>

478
00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:18.130
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

479
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:18.361
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

480
00:13:18.361 --> 00:13:19.670
<v Speaker 4>I've met Ron Paul and know him.</v>

481
00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:21.000
<v Speaker 4>We're not good friends.</v>

482
00:13:21.001 --> 00:13:22.320
<v Speaker 4>He's been in a film I made,</v>

483
00:13:22.321 --> 00:13:24.720
<v Speaker 4>but I've tracked him for a long time when we're,</v>

484
00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:26.040
<v Speaker 4>when Ron Paul said,</v>

485
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:27.090
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

486
00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:30.570
<v Speaker 4>now the White House is trying to tell us that Iran had something to do when with</v>

487
00:13:30.571 --> 00:13:31.141
<v Speaker 4>nine 11.</v>

488
00:13:31.141 --> 00:13:31.261
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

489
00:13:31.261 --> 00:13:32.094
<v Speaker 4>that's what they ended.</v>

490
00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:33.720
<v Speaker 4>The audience went berserk.</v>

491
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.630
<v Speaker 4>The collective consciousness and waking up,</v>

492
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.070
<v Speaker 4>everybody here is like,</v>

493
00:13:41.071 --> 00:13:41.551
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

494
00:13:41.551 --> 00:13:42.780
<v Speaker 4>filled right up to here,</v>

495
00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:44.730
<v Speaker 4>right up to here right now.</v>

496
00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.200
<v Speaker 4>And they're just ready.</v>

497
00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:46.650
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

498
00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:50.190
<v Speaker 4>and really that's why I think Ron Paul such a threat right now because of Ron</v>

499
00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:51.060
<v Speaker 4>Paul wins in Iowa,</v>

500
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.433
<v Speaker 4>not would,</v>

501
00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:53.550
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

502
00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:53.970
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

503
00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:57.360
<v Speaker 4>it's a whole new political ballgame in this country because that all of a sudden</v>

504
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:58.040
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

505
00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.580
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be the norm,</v>

506
00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:05.190
<v Speaker 4>a substantial norm for people to see somebody like Ron Paul not believing all</v>

507
00:14:05.191 --> 00:14:05.970
<v Speaker 4>that bull shit,</v>

508
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:06.870
<v Speaker 4>then it's safe for them.</v>

509
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.240
<v Speaker 4>How rig do you think voting is,</v>

510
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:11.160
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

511
00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.230
<v Speaker 4>do you think is rigged at all?</v>

512
00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:13.710
<v Speaker 4>Do you think it's 100% legitimate?</v>

513
00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:14.220
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

514
00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:15.210
<v Speaker 4>you think it's rigged still.</v>

515
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:16.351
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>

516
00:14:16.351 --> 00:14:20.460
<v Speaker 4>after 2000 and I've been an investigative journalist for a long time and I've</v>

517
00:14:20.461 --> 00:14:21.840
<v Speaker 4>done a lot of writing about this.</v>

518
00:14:21.841 --> 00:14:25.890
<v Speaker 4>They took the election 2000 was stolen election 2004 choice point,</v>

519
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:26.731
<v Speaker 4>Dee Dee bold,</v>

520
00:14:26.731 --> 00:14:27.830
<v Speaker 4>all the software and all that.</v>

521
00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.510
<v Speaker 4>I watched that documentary making democracy.</v>

522
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:31.860
<v Speaker 4>Unbelievable.</v>

523
00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.420
<v Speaker 4>So fascinating.</v>

524
00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:35.160
<v Speaker 4>But they can rig within certain,</v>

525
00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:37.200
<v Speaker 4>because there are people who see the polling places.</v>

526
00:14:37.201 --> 00:14:39.000
<v Speaker 4>There are people and people know,</v>

527
00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:39.571
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

528
00:14:39.571 --> 00:14:41.370
<v Speaker 4>we had 80 people come in who are on Paul.</v>

529
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:46.080
<v Speaker 4>So they can't just say if 80% of the people vote green,</v>

530
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.900
<v Speaker 4>the 80% voted red cause nobody would believe it.</v>

531
00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:49.870
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

532
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:50.220
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

533
00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:54.350
<v Speaker 4>So I think that Ron Paul is so far,</v>

534
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:57.380
<v Speaker 4>way much further ahead than he's being shown in the polls.</v>

535
00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:00.740
<v Speaker 4>I really think that there is a,</v>

536
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.610
<v Speaker 4>let's say Ron Paul is in the forties and 50s and I,</v>

537
00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:07.730
<v Speaker 4>which they wouldn't dare let be known the and,</v>

538
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:08.631
<v Speaker 4>and the point is,</v>

539
00:15:08.631 --> 00:15:10.700
<v Speaker 4>if he wins are wins with a landslide.</v>

540
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:11.520
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

541
00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.690
<v Speaker 4>it's now Democrats and Republicans no more.</v>

542
00:15:14.691 --> 00:15:15.231
<v Speaker 4>It's Ron,</v>

543
00:15:15.231 --> 00:15:17.450
<v Speaker 4>Paul and the Democrats and the Republicans.</v>

544
00:15:17.451 --> 00:15:18.590
<v Speaker 4>So we've got a whole new paradigm.</v>

545
00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:19.963
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>

546
00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:20.800
<v Speaker 5>I won.</v>

547
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:21.041
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

548
00:15:21.041 --> 00:15:24.670
<v Speaker 5>So he has to win by such a substantial margin that they can't fake it.</v>

549
00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:27.160
<v Speaker 5>It has to almost be unanimous.</v>

550
00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:27.840
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

551
00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.673
<v Speaker 5>it's so far,</v>

552
00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.750
<v Speaker 5>the frightening thing to a lot of people about it is the dis,</v>

553
00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:34.090
<v Speaker 5>the sheer change that,</v>

554
00:15:34.091 --> 00:15:35.680
<v Speaker 5>or a Ron Paul would bring about.</v>

555
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:36.510
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

556
00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:40.840
<v Speaker 5>that a real change like that is absolutely terrifying to people.</v>

557
00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:43.960
<v Speaker 5>Even though they know that the situation right now is completely fucked up.</v>

558
00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.250
<v Speaker 5>Completely unfair.</v>

559
00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:46.720
<v Speaker 5>The congress is bought,</v>

560
00:15:46.721 --> 00:15:47.770
<v Speaker 5>everything is stolen.</v>

561
00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:49.060
<v Speaker 5>It's a total wreck.</v>

562
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.080
<v Speaker 5>They would still,</v>

563
00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:51.490
<v Speaker 5>they're terrified of change.</v>

564
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:52.623
<v Speaker 5>It's terrified.</v>

565
00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:54.430
<v Speaker 5>Not so much anymore.</v>

566
00:15:54.431 --> 00:15:56.680
<v Speaker 5>You've got to get beaten into a state of reasonableness.</v>

567
00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:57.461
<v Speaker 5>You think it's the,</v>

568
00:15:57.461 --> 00:15:58.630
<v Speaker 5>it's at the tipping point.</v>

569
00:15:58.631 --> 00:16:03.340
<v Speaker 5>We're at the collapse of human industrial civilization says 2008 that the world</v>

570
00:16:03.341 --> 00:16:04.780
<v Speaker 5>is turned inside out several times.</v>

571
00:16:04.781 --> 00:16:06.100
<v Speaker 5>It's getting nothing but worse.</v>

572
00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:07.420
<v Speaker 5>And people are,</v>

573
00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:08.240
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

574
00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.350
<v Speaker 5>one of the best lines I heard out of the occupy movement was,</v>

575
00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:11.680
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

576
00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.040
<v Speaker 5>somebody was asking the protesters are moving along in New York and what are you</v>

577
00:16:16.041 --> 00:16:16.691
<v Speaker 5>protesting?</v>

578
00:16:16.691 --> 00:16:17.800
<v Speaker 5>And this really attractive,</v>

579
00:16:17.801 --> 00:16:20.080
<v Speaker 5>smart woman says everything.</v>

580
00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:22.660
<v Speaker 5>Everything,</v>

581
00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.120
<v Speaker 5>everything is corrupt.</v>

582
00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:27.040
<v Speaker 5>Everything is a lie.</v>

583
00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.600
<v Speaker 5>Everything is bogus.</v>

584
00:16:28.601 --> 00:16:29.220
<v Speaker 5>And all,</v>

585
00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:29.471
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

586
00:16:29.471 --> 00:16:31.000
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of us that can see that.</v>

587
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.720
<v Speaker 5>Is it gotten worse or have people just gotten more aware?</v>

588
00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:37.880
<v Speaker 4>Both.</v>

589
00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:38.660
<v Speaker 4>Both.</v>

590
00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:39.130
<v Speaker 4>Both.</v>

591
00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:43.510
<v Speaker 5>So it's accelerating as well as people picking up on the rate of chain.</v>

592
00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:44.570
<v Speaker 5>Now you gotta remember I'm,</v>

593
00:16:44.571 --> 00:16:45.071
<v Speaker 5>I'm this guy,</v>

594
00:16:45.071 --> 00:16:48.580
<v Speaker 5>it's been at this 35 years and you don't want it to look so healthy.</v>

595
00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.350
<v Speaker 5>You should be a fucking mess.</v>

596
00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:50.561
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

597
00:16:50.561 --> 00:16:50.980
<v Speaker 5>I am.</v>

598
00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:52.090
<v Speaker 5>The amount of stress.</v>

599
00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:53.500
<v Speaker 5>But you look fine.</v>

600
00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.580
<v Speaker 5>I eat really good.</v>

601
00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:55.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

602
00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:55.290
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

603
00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:57.610
<v Speaker 5>I'm on two and a half acres in northern California.</v>

604
00:16:58.210 --> 00:16:59.500
<v Speaker 5>Outside of Sebastopol.</v>

605
00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:00.413
<v Speaker 5>Permaculture,</v>

606
00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:01.331
<v Speaker 5>you grow your own.</v>

607
00:17:01.331 --> 00:17:01.571
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

608
00:17:01.571 --> 00:17:04.300
<v Speaker 5>we're growing food and I eat raw organic.</v>

609
00:17:04.301 --> 00:17:08.080
<v Speaker 5>I go out and pick a raw salad out of my garden and just eat it after you pick</v>

610
00:17:08.081 --> 00:17:08.770
<v Speaker 5>the leaf.</v>

611
00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:09.340
<v Speaker 5>Oh Wow.</v>

612
00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:10.060
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

613
00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:11.200
<v Speaker 5>and so I eat good.</v>

614
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:12.130
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

615
00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:16.180
<v Speaker 5>and other than that I'm maybe good genes and I spent a lot of time working out</v>

616
00:17:16.181 --> 00:17:17.530
<v Speaker 5>and training over and over the years,</v>

617
00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:17.920
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

618
00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:18.300
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

619
00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:19.133
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

620
00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.150
<v Speaker 5>I had to and I hung with some really cool people along the way.</v>

621
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:23.463
<v Speaker 5>Right now my,</v>

622
00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.100
<v Speaker 5>I have a bad rotator cuff here.</v>

623
00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:25.990
<v Speaker 5>The cartilage is gone,</v>

624
00:17:25.991 --> 00:17:27.070
<v Speaker 5>so I can't work out too much.</v>

625
00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:27.670
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>

626
00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:28.503
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

627
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:29.021
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

628
00:17:29.021 --> 00:17:29.711
<v Speaker 5>That's a drag.</v>

629
00:17:29.711 --> 00:17:32.080
<v Speaker 5>We're shoulder injuries or they're very complicated,</v>

630
00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.460
<v Speaker 5>very difficult to fix.</v>

631
00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:35.200
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people have shoulder issues,</v>

632
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.140
<v Speaker 5>becomes a big problem till they have surgery on it.</v>

633
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:39.790
<v Speaker 5>And even then like surgery,</v>

634
00:17:39.791 --> 00:17:40.660
<v Speaker 5>now they're pretty good at it.</v>

635
00:17:40.661 --> 00:17:41.800
<v Speaker 5>But back in the day,</v>

636
00:17:41.801 --> 00:17:42.910
<v Speaker 5>if you had a shoulder issue,</v>

637
00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:43.721
<v Speaker 5>it was a big one.</v>

638
00:17:43.721 --> 00:17:44.201
<v Speaker 5>It's just such a,</v>

639
00:17:44.201 --> 00:17:45.460
<v Speaker 5>such a complicated joint.</v>

640
00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.141
<v Speaker 5>But that's a,</v>

641
00:17:47.141 --> 00:17:48.580
<v Speaker 5>so that's the way you blew off steam.</v>

642
00:17:48.581 --> 00:17:50.160
<v Speaker 5>But I can't imagine being under</v>

643
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:51.300
<v Speaker 1>that kind of pressure,</v>

644
00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:52.143
<v Speaker 1>having,</v>

645
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.600
<v Speaker 1>knowing that people were upset at me knowing what I w you know what you said,</v>

646
00:17:56.601 --> 00:18:00.470
<v Speaker 1>you know about all these fucking bad people and your,</v>

647
00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:01.403
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

648
00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:02.730
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

649
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:03.051
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

650
00:18:03.051 --> 00:18:03.300
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

651
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:03.870
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

652
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:04.620
<v Speaker 1>you're out there,</v>

653
00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:04.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

654
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.520
<v Speaker 1>exposed constantly,</v>

655
00:18:06.521 --> 00:18:06.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

656
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:07.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

657
00:18:07.081 --> 00:18:08.880
<v Speaker 1>doing radio interviews,</v>

658
00:18:08.881 --> 00:18:09.870
<v Speaker 1>constantly doing,</v>

659
00:18:09.871 --> 00:18:10.704
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

660
00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:12.050
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

661
00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:12.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

662
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:17.910
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't have been able to do any of this without my spiritual life and,</v>

663
00:18:17.911 --> 00:18:18.211
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

664
00:18:18.211 --> 00:18:21.150
<v Speaker 3>and some very deep and profound spiritual practices.</v>

665
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:22.250
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>

666
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:23.083
<v Speaker 3>I'm a guy in,</v>

667
00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.830
<v Speaker 3>I believe that this planet is alive.</v>

668
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.260
<v Speaker 3>A guy in a guy.</v>

669
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:29.011
<v Speaker 3>What kind of,</v>

670
00:18:29.011 --> 00:18:31.140
<v Speaker 3>what does this is like a religion?</v>

671
00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:31.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

672
00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:33.120
<v Speaker 3>Guy At mother earth.</v>

673
00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:33.983

674
00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:34.520
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

675
00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.670
<v Speaker 3>isn't it interesting that,</v>

676
00:18:35.671 --> 00:18:35.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

677
00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:36.330
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

678
00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.340
<v Speaker 3>you take the planets out from the sun,</v>

679
00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.080
<v Speaker 3>Mercury is a god.</v>

680
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:43.190
<v Speaker 3>Venus is a goddess squat bar.</v>

681
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:46.020
<v Speaker 3>Mars is it got every other planet is a god or a goddess,</v>

682
00:18:46.021 --> 00:18:46.801
<v Speaker 3>except for this one.</v>

683
00:18:46.801 --> 00:18:47.280
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

684
00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.120
<v Speaker 3>Her name is Gloria.</v>

685
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.313
<v Speaker 3>She's alive.</v>

686
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:50.851
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

687
00:18:50.851 --> 00:18:51.301
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

688
00:18:51.301 --> 00:18:53.150
<v Speaker 3>is this something that's actually written down as,</v>

689
00:18:53.151 --> 00:18:54.630
<v Speaker 3>as an ideology or is it just your,</v>

690
00:18:54.631 --> 00:18:58.750
<v Speaker 3>you have a philosophy behind it kind of originated with Dr. James Lovelock and,</v>

691
00:18:58.751 --> 00:18:59.584
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

692
00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:00.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

693
00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:00.900
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

694
00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:02.790
<v Speaker 3>it's new and it's also very old.</v>

695
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:03.330
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

696
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:03.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

697
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:04.111
<v Speaker 3>I'm also,</v>

698
00:19:04.111 --> 00:19:07.620
<v Speaker 3>I've also studied native American spirituality quite a bit.</v>

699
00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:07.920
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

700
00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:08.721
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

701
00:19:08.721 --> 00:19:10.440
<v Speaker 3>it's exactly the same thing.</v>

702
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:11.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

703
00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:12.091
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

704
00:19:12.091 --> 00:19:16.710
<v Speaker 3>it seems to me that we have a pretty limited idea of what life is or what's</v>

705
00:19:16.711 --> 00:19:17.401
<v Speaker 3>conscious.</v>

706
00:19:17.401 --> 00:19:17.730
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

707
00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:20.250
<v Speaker 1>we feel like if it can't react and communicate with us,</v>

708
00:19:20.251 --> 00:19:21.240
<v Speaker 1>it can't be conscious.</v>

709
00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:21.931
<v Speaker 1>But there's,</v>

710
00:19:21.931 --> 00:19:22.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

711
00:19:22.251 --> 00:19:22.351
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

712
00:19:22.351 --> 00:19:25.080
<v Speaker 1>apparently there's been some studies that show that it's very possible that</v>

713
00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:28.890
<v Speaker 1>plant's recognize people when they're in the room and they feel energy and they</v>

714
00:19:28.891 --> 00:19:32.460
<v Speaker 1>can actually react to someone doing something to them.</v>

715
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:33.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

716
00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:36.300
<v Speaker 1>they might have some sort of consciousness that we can't understand.</v>

717
00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.520
<v Speaker 1>We just only assume that consciousness,</v>

718
00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:39.480
<v Speaker 1>human consciousness,</v>

719
00:19:39.481 --> 00:19:41.460
<v Speaker 1>there might be rock consciousness.</v>

720
00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:41.671
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

721
00:19:41.671 --> 00:19:43.170
<v Speaker 1>everything might have a consciousness.</v>

722
00:19:43.171 --> 00:19:45.570
<v Speaker 1>It might just be enabled to express itself.</v>

723
00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:49.180
<v Speaker 1>And the idea of this has a giant super organism is so fascinating.</v>

724
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:49.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

725
00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.990
<v Speaker 1>It's so amazing because we know that everything,</v>

726
00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.000
<v Speaker 1>nothing exists on its own.</v>

727
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:54.601
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

728
00:19:54.601 --> 00:19:59.220
<v Speaker 1>every single body is a mixture of all sorts of different bacteria,</v>

729
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:03.840
<v Speaker 1>microbiotic particles and all sorts of different things that are constantly</v>

730
00:20:03.841 --> 00:20:04.471
<v Speaker 1>helping you.</v>

731
00:20:04.471 --> 00:20:05.340
<v Speaker 1>Or macrobiotic,</v>

732
00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:05.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

733
00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:06.480
<v Speaker 1>like when you eat,</v>

734
00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.350
<v Speaker 1>you're eating yogurt,</v>

735
00:20:07.351 --> 00:20:07.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

736
00:20:07.501 --> 00:20:08.670
<v Speaker 1>you're taking in troops.</v>

737
00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:09.181
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

738
00:20:09.181 --> 00:20:10.420
<v Speaker 1>when you taking the Acidophilus,</v>

739
00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.600
<v Speaker 1>you're bringing in healthy animals,</v>

740
00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:14.220
<v Speaker 1>living organisms.</v>

741
00:20:14.221 --> 00:20:14.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

742
00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:19.520
<v Speaker 1>it's so fascinating that we absolutely need that in order to stay healthy and be</v>

743
00:20:19.681 --> 00:20:20.514
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

744
00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:23.400
<v Speaker 3>One of the things I just did [inaudible] was a very cool,</v>

745
00:20:23.401 --> 00:20:24.750
<v Speaker 3>I live in the West Sonoma County,</v>

746
00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:25.683
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

747
00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:26.670
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

748
00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.110
<v Speaker 3>there's a spa and I had,</v>

749
00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:31.440
<v Speaker 3>I had done it like three months without a day off for collapsed.</v>

750
00:20:31.441 --> 00:20:31.621
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

751
00:20:31.621 --> 00:20:31.950
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

752
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:32.783
<v Speaker 3>that's my,</v>

753
00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:33.301
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

754
00:20:33.301 --> 00:20:33.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

755
00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:35.580
<v Speaker 3>company and doing the radio show.</v>

756
00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:39.570
<v Speaker 3>And so I treated myself and they have a spa where you go and you actually take a</v>

757
00:20:39.571 --> 00:20:44.571
<v Speaker 3>bath in a hot living compost pile and it's specially bred complex,</v>

758
00:20:46.121 --> 00:20:46.530
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

759
00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:49.420
<v Speaker 3>everything is alive and it's warm and you become,</v>

760
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.350
<v Speaker 3>and it just,</v>

761
00:20:50.351 --> 00:20:50.710
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>

762
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:53.590
<v Speaker 3>it sucks stuff out of you that's just really cool.</v>

763
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:54.310
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

764
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:54.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

765
00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:55.623
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

766
00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:56.763
<v Speaker 3>That's freaky.</v>

767
00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:57.941
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

768
00:20:57.941 --> 00:20:59.990
<v Speaker 3>They said it's so weird though.</v>

769
00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:00.310
<v Speaker 3>What a,</v>

770
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:01.570
<v Speaker 3>a s a different,</v>

771
00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:02.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

772
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.130
<v Speaker 3>we're like a soup,</v>

773
00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:03.761
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

774
00:21:03.761 --> 00:21:06.970
<v Speaker 3>we're not just one ingredient and it's really fascinating and the think of the</v>

775
00:21:06.971 --> 00:21:10.450
<v Speaker 3>earth as being that just the expressing itself in a larger way.</v>

776
00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:14.740
<v Speaker 3>There's a great movie that just came out this year called Anima Mundi,</v>

777
00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:14.981
<v Speaker 3>m,</v>

778
00:21:14.981 --> 00:21:17.950
<v Speaker 3>U N D I a out of Australia and it's got big names.</v>

779
00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:19.480
<v Speaker 3>I've got Noam Chomsky in it.</v>

780
00:21:19.481 --> 00:21:23.010
<v Speaker 3>It's got a whole bunch and it's all about [inaudible].</v>

781
00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.970
<v Speaker 3>And there was some tremendous,</v>

782
00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:25.930
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

783
00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:29.300
<v Speaker 3>tremendous awakening things in the [inaudible] you just look at.</v>

784
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:32.200
<v Speaker 3>And the science is really good to support that to see.</v>

785
00:21:32.201 --> 00:21:36.010
<v Speaker 3>I think the big problem is now is if,</v>

786
00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.080
<v Speaker 3>let's say you and I are Martians or from another planet,</v>

787
00:21:38.081 --> 00:21:40.990
<v Speaker 3>we just came down here to check out what's happened and what these creatures</v>

788
00:21:40.991 --> 00:21:41.351
<v Speaker 3>down here,</v>

789
00:21:41.351 --> 00:21:42.040
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

790
00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:42.970
<v Speaker 3>And the first thing that like,</v>

791
00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:43.510
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

792
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:44.141
<v Speaker 3>they're insane.</v>

793
00:21:44.141 --> 00:21:45.190
<v Speaker 3>They're destroying the place.</v>

794
00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:45.700
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

795
00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:46.320
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

796
00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:46.590
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

797
00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:48.130
<v Speaker 3>and that's all we have to live on.</v>

798
00:21:48.131 --> 00:21:49.720
<v Speaker 3>So what are they doing?</v>

799
00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:50.740
<v Speaker 3>They're shifting where the,</v>

800
00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.740
<v Speaker 3>and I really think that that originates with,</v>

801
00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:54.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

802
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:54.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

803
00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:55.780
<v Speaker 3>genesis one.</v>

804
00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:56.201
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

805
00:21:56.201 --> 00:21:56.421
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

806
00:21:56.421 --> 00:21:57.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm at war with God,</v>

807
00:21:57.730 --> 00:21:59.770
<v Speaker 3>or at least the religion to the god of old,</v>

808
00:21:59.771 --> 00:22:01.270
<v Speaker 3>the guys that brought us to this point.</v>

809
00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:01.930
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

810
00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:02.250
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

811
00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:05.830
<v Speaker 3>and I'm at war with the God that gave Man Dominion over the planet.</v>

812
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:07.143
<v Speaker 3>Bullshit.</v>

813
00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:08.710
<v Speaker 3>That's why we're destroying it.</v>

814
00:22:08.711 --> 00:22:10.210
<v Speaker 3>We'd been separated from it.</v>

815
00:22:10.211 --> 00:22:11.110
<v Speaker 3>We were taught that we,</v>

816
00:22:11.111 --> 00:22:11.220
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

817
00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:12.850
<v Speaker 3>and I don't believe that that's true.</v>

818
00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:16.690
<v Speaker 3>And I believe that if there's any one lie that's enabled all this corruption,</v>

819
00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:17.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

820
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:19.600
<v Speaker 3>a lot of it to be hidden under the guise of religion.</v>

821
00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:20.351
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

822
00:22:20.351 --> 00:22:20.800
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

823
00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:21.633
<v Speaker 3>that's the big one.</v>

824
00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:26.980
<v Speaker 3>So you think then if you can get enough people to recognize this earth as a</v>

825
00:22:26.981 --> 00:22:27.880
<v Speaker 3>living thing,</v>

826
00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:30.990
<v Speaker 3>we could change the way people behave and change the practices.</v>

827
00:22:30.991 --> 00:22:32.380
<v Speaker 3>So it doesn't seem to be,</v>

828
00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:37.000
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't seem to have been that long ago people didn't destroy the earth at</v>

829
00:22:37.001 --> 00:22:37.740
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

830
00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:38.350
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

831
00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:39.790
<v Speaker 3>just a few hundred years ago,</v>

832
00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:41.020
<v Speaker 3>the oceans were clean,</v>

833
00:22:41.021 --> 00:22:41.440
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

834
00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:41.681
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

835
00:22:41.681 --> 00:22:42.041
<v Speaker 3>how many,</v>

836
00:22:42.041 --> 00:22:44.140
<v Speaker 3>how many hundreds of years ago was there were,</v>

837
00:22:44.141 --> 00:22:45.820
<v Speaker 3>was there no pollution?</v>

838
00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:47.921
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

839
00:22:47.921 --> 00:22:51.550
<v Speaker 3>You would have to go back probably to the 12 hundreds earth know that there was</v>

840
00:22:51.551 --> 00:22:51.760
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

841
00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.210
<v Speaker 3>there was part of it in,</v>

842
00:22:53.211 --> 00:22:53.741
<v Speaker 3>in Rome.</v>

843
00:22:53.741 --> 00:22:54.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

844
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.940
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

845
00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:55.450
<v Speaker 3>poop.</v>

846
00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:57.670
<v Speaker 3>But let's go back 40,000 years ago.</v>

847
00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:58.050
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

848
00:22:58.050 --> 00:22:58.883
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

849
00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:02.140
<v Speaker 3>And then are our ancestors who were going og or whoever the F,</v>

850
00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:02.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

851
00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:03.490
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

852
00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:05.440
<v Speaker 3>well first they were living their religion.</v>

853
00:23:05.441 --> 00:23:05.951
<v Speaker 3>24,</v>

854
00:23:05.951 --> 00:23:06.271
<v Speaker 3>seven.</v>

855
00:23:06.271 --> 00:23:07.200
<v Speaker 3>There was not a textbook.</v>

856
00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:08.231
<v Speaker 3>So you didn't,</v>

857
00:23:08.231 --> 00:23:09.430
<v Speaker 3>nobody persuaded them,</v>

858
00:23:09.431 --> 00:23:10.061
<v Speaker 3>converted them.</v>

859
00:23:10.061 --> 00:23:12.400
<v Speaker 3>That's just the way they live.</v>

860
00:23:12.401 --> 00:23:13.480
<v Speaker 3>The earth was the Bible.</v>

861
00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:14.740
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

862
00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:15.520
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

863
00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.590
<v Speaker 3>Some things are sacred and you know,</v>

864
00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:19.270
<v Speaker 3>there are things that you don't do,</v>

865
00:23:19.271 --> 00:23:21.070
<v Speaker 3>like stick your finger into a light socket.</v>

866
00:23:21.071 --> 00:23:22.520
<v Speaker 3>Thou shalt not because you know,</v>

867
00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:23.770
<v Speaker 3>it hurts or you die.</v>

868
00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:25.360
<v Speaker 3>And there were rules in nature.</v>

869
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:30.010
<v Speaker 3>Thou shalt not stay out in the cold and over x number of hours or after this was</v>

870
00:23:30.011 --> 00:23:32.950
<v Speaker 3>that that was the religion because it was a direct feedback.</v>

871
00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:33.551
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

872
00:23:33.551 --> 00:23:37.300
<v Speaker 3>I've always felt the native American ideal of using every single bit of the</v>

873
00:23:37.301 --> 00:23:38.450
<v Speaker 3>animal that you kill in,</v>

874
00:23:38.451 --> 00:23:38.771
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

875
00:23:38.771 --> 00:23:39.920
<v Speaker 3>in honor of the animal.</v>

876
00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:42.520
<v Speaker 3>That there's something very important about that.</v>

877
00:23:42.521 --> 00:23:43.121
<v Speaker 3>I went to,</v>

878
00:23:43.121 --> 00:23:43.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

879
00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:44.140
<v Speaker 3>it's fair,</v>

880
00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:44.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

881
00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.190
<v Speaker 3>Tom Brown of Tom Brown tracker schools,</v>

882
00:23:46.191 --> 00:23:48.650
<v Speaker 3>a friend of mine and I went to his Drucker school,</v>

883
00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:51.560
<v Speaker 3>maximize sister and I went to his tracker school in February.</v>

884
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:52.423
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

885
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:53.690
<v Speaker 3>that's what they teach too,</v>

886
00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:54.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

887
00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:54.890
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

888
00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:55.341
<v Speaker 3>but anyway,</v>

889
00:23:55.341 --> 00:23:57.740
<v Speaker 3>so our ancestors 40,000 years ago running around,</v>

890
00:23:57.741 --> 00:23:58.310
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

891
00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:00.380
<v Speaker 3>they didn't all of a sudden stop one day and going,</v>

892
00:24:00.381 --> 00:24:04.550
<v Speaker 3>why am I having this wilderness experience that was all north.</v>

893
00:24:04.551 --> 00:24:06.700
<v Speaker 3>That was so what,</v>

894
00:24:06.701 --> 00:24:10.460
<v Speaker 3>what Mankiw's task is now with the collapse of human industrial civilization,</v>

895
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:11.180
<v Speaker 3>which is here,</v>

896
00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:12.190
<v Speaker 3>which cannot be stopped,</v>

897
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.640
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

898
00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.050
<v Speaker 3>is not so much to learn,</v>

899
00:24:15.051 --> 00:24:19.640
<v Speaker 3>but to remember stuff that we've known inside of us.</v>

900
00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:20.780
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

901
00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:24.500
<v Speaker 3>forever and you've got to clear a lot of garbage out of the way,</v>

902
00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:25.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

903
00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:26.300
<v Speaker 3>to get there.</v>

904
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:26.720
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

905
00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.553
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

906
00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:30.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty optimistic about what I see.</v>

907
00:24:30.231 --> 00:24:30.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

908
00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:30.750
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

909
00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:33.380
<v Speaker 3>I started collapsing that my company collapse net.com.</v>

910
00:24:33.381 --> 00:24:34.214
<v Speaker 3>There's the plug.</v>

911
00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:35.430
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

912
00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:37.450
<v Speaker 5>and we're in 68 countries.</v>

913
00:24:37.451 --> 00:24:39.130
<v Speaker 5>We're getting 40,000 visitors a day.</v>

914
00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:42.580
<v Speaker 5>You're optimistic and won't way like the collapse is going to be a good thing.</v>

915
00:24:42.581 --> 00:24:42.821
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>

916
00:24:42.821 --> 00:24:43.251
<v Speaker 5>I'm seeing,</v>

917
00:24:43.251 --> 00:24:43.370
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

918
00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:44.300
<v Speaker 3>people awakening.</v>

919
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.490
<v Speaker 3>I am seeing people,</v>

920
00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:46.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

921
00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:47.151
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

922
00:24:47.151 --> 00:24:47.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

923
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:49.100
<v Speaker 3>as I said in the movie collapsed.</v>

924
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.400
<v Speaker 3>Mankind's choice now is evolve or perish,</v>

925
00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:57.670
<v Speaker 3>grow the fuck up or die because the laws of nature cannot be overturned.</v>

926
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.900
<v Speaker 3>And that's the fundamental thing that's wrong with this infinite growth paradigm</v>

927
00:25:02.901 --> 00:25:03.734
<v Speaker 3>that we live in.</v>

928
00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:04.790
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

929
00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:06.140
<v Speaker 3>we'll do that separate.</v>

930
00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:07.090
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

931
00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:07.923
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

932
00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:09.650
<v Speaker 3>where was I?</v>

933
00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:14.120
<v Speaker 3>All of that done all that done and that world we live in is dying and there's a</v>

934
00:25:14.121 --> 00:25:15.500
<v Speaker 3>new consciousness emerging.</v>

935
00:25:15.501 --> 00:25:16.190
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

936
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:17.330
<v Speaker 3>my friend Colin Campbell,</v>

937
00:25:17.331 --> 00:25:18.140
<v Speaker 3>who was one of the,</v>

938
00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:18.973
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

939
00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:19.820
<v Speaker 3>he's the Godfather,</v>

940
00:25:19.821 --> 00:25:21.800
<v Speaker 3>that people well movement said that,</v>

941
00:25:21.801 --> 00:25:21.921
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

942
00:25:21.921 --> 00:25:22.401
<v Speaker 3>the species,</v>

943
00:25:22.401 --> 00:25:24.380
<v Speaker 3>homo sapiens might not become extinct,</v>

944
00:25:24.381 --> 00:25:26.960
<v Speaker 3>but the subspecies of petroleum man,</v>

945
00:25:26.961 --> 00:25:28.010
<v Speaker 3>most certainly will.</v>

946
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:29.060
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

947
00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:29.540
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

948
00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:30.410
<v Speaker 3>So there's posts,</v>

949
00:25:30.411 --> 00:25:30.921
<v Speaker 3>petroleum,</v>

950
00:25:30.921 --> 00:25:31.340
<v Speaker 3>human,</v>

951
00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:33.930
<v Speaker 3>and there's a new consciousness emerging and there are,</v>

952
00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:37.120
<v Speaker 3>there are tens of millions of us around the world and,</v>

953
00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:37.840
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

954
00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:41.930
<v Speaker 3>and truly I think there may be hundreds of millions or a billion or more of us</v>

955
00:25:41.931 --> 00:25:42.441
<v Speaker 3>around the world.</v>

956
00:25:42.441 --> 00:25:44.330
<v Speaker 3>We just haven't been allowed to see each other yet.</v>

957
00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.840
<v Speaker 3>There's something with that matrix that keeps you from seeing all the other</v>

958
00:25:47.841 --> 00:25:48.674
<v Speaker 3>people who feel,</v>

959
00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:51.240
<v Speaker 3>that's why with you and Ron Paul on a,</v>

960
00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:52.730
<v Speaker 3>on Leno,</v>

961
00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:54.620
<v Speaker 3>when the audience started cheering,</v>

962
00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.450
<v Speaker 3>it was like that was a,</v>

963
00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:00.260
<v Speaker 3>that was a bitch slap bucket of cold water to the face of Barack Obama and</v>

964
00:26:00.261 --> 00:26:01.310
<v Speaker 3>everybody in Washington,</v>

965
00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:01.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

966
00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:03.740
<v Speaker 3>who thought they could actually get away with this stuff again,</v>

967
00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:05.421
<v Speaker 5>you think Obama,</v>

968
00:26:05.421 --> 00:26:08.450
<v Speaker 5>do you think Obama knew what was gonna happen before he got into office?</v>

969
00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.313
<v Speaker 5>Cause he seems,</v>

970
00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.270
<v Speaker 5>it seems to me,</v>

971
00:26:11.271 --> 00:26:12.890
<v Speaker 5>me seems so ineffective.</v>

972
00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:16.790
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like he had an idea of what it would be like.</v>

973
00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:17.930
<v Speaker 5>And then when he got in,</v>

974
00:26:17.931 --> 00:26:20.000
<v Speaker 5>there is just nothing like that.</v>

975
00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:22.250
<v Speaker 5>Barack Obama's extremely effective.</v>

976
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:24.830
<v Speaker 5>He's extremely effective for his client base,</v>

977
00:26:24.831 --> 00:26:29.831
<v Speaker 5>which is the banks that is a banking president and there's no difference between</v>

978
00:26:30.561 --> 00:26:31.880
<v Speaker 5>Democrat and Republican.</v>

979
00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:32.210
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

980
00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:33.580
<v Speaker 5>Barack Obama had no intent,</v>

981
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.370
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

982
00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:37.610
<v Speaker 5>he seemed like one of us when he was running for president,</v>

983
00:26:37.611 --> 00:26:38.930
<v Speaker 5>he seemed like one of us,</v>

984
00:26:38.931 --> 00:26:40.210
<v Speaker 5>it seemed like he was going to,</v>

985
00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:42.490
<v Speaker 5>you're not with microphones on elbow.</v>

986
00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 5>It's probably cause</v>

987
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:44.813
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>

988
00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:45.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

989
00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:46.590
<v Speaker 4>he probably started off,</v>

990
00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.350
<v Speaker 4>thank you.</v>

991
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:48.270
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to know.</v>

992
00:26:48.271 --> 00:26:49.130
<v Speaker 4>I always wanted to know.</v>

993
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:49.420
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

994
00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:50.730
<v Speaker 4>it wouldn't have been Nama.</v>

995
00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:52.520
<v Speaker 4>He wouldn't have ever gotten close to,</v>

996
00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:55.440
<v Speaker 4>to the nomination unless his loyalty had been secured.</v>

997
00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:56.970
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>

998
00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:58.710
<v Speaker 4>It's so crabbing at that's real.</v>

999
00:26:58.720 --> 00:26:59.553
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1000
00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:01.320
<v Speaker 5>It's such a fucking Rina.</v>

1001
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:02.521
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1002
00:27:02.521 --> 00:27:04.320
<v Speaker 5>If it really is that rigged,</v>

1003
00:27:04.321 --> 00:27:04.561
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1004
00:27:04.561 --> 00:27:04.890
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1005
00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:05.131
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1006
00:27:05.131 --> 00:27:06.750
<v Speaker 5>it's almost preposterous.</v>

1007
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:09.570
<v Speaker 5>It's able to go on as long as it has.</v>

1008
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:10.291
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

1009
00:27:10.291 --> 00:27:10.920
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1010
00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:11.211
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

1011
00:27:11.211 --> 00:27:11.760
<v Speaker 4>I've had,</v>

1012
00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:12.593
<v Speaker 4>I've done a lot of shit.</v>

1013
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:13.620
<v Speaker 4>I've been around a long time.</v>

1014
00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.380
<v Speaker 4>I was the press spokesman for Ross Perot.</v>

1015
00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:17.130
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

1016
00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:22.130
<v Speaker 4>In Los Angeles County in 1992 at a time when Ross Perot was ahead of both George</v>

1017
00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:23.071
<v Speaker 4>Bush and Bill Clinton.</v>

1018
00:27:23.071 --> 00:27:23.740
<v Speaker 4>Remember that?</v>

1019
00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:24.480
<v Speaker 4>10 Poles.</v>

1020
00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.190
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1021
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.461
<v Speaker 5>Hi,</v>

1022
00:27:25.461 --> 00:27:26.300
<v Speaker 5>I'm Ross Perot shorts,</v>

1023
00:27:26.301 --> 00:27:27.710
<v Speaker 5>floppy or texting with a big nose.</v>

1024
00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:31.910
<v Speaker 5>Remember when he took out that and he basically bought a half an hour of</v>

1025
00:27:31.911 --> 00:27:35.840
<v Speaker 5>television in prime time and explain what's wrong with,</v>

1026
00:27:35.841 --> 00:27:37.850
<v Speaker 5>what was it with the tax structure.</v>

1027
00:27:37.851 --> 00:27:38.631
<v Speaker 5>I forgot what it was,</v>

1028
00:27:38.631 --> 00:27:39.650
<v Speaker 5>but it was just and,</v>

1029
00:27:39.651 --> 00:27:40.011
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1030
00:27:40.011 --> 00:27:40.240
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1031
00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.290
<v Speaker 5>the debt debt.</v>

1032
00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.050
<v Speaker 5>And he explained it all and spelled it out.</v>

1033
00:27:45.051 --> 00:27:46.670
<v Speaker 5>And he's the only one that made any sense.</v>

1034
00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:47.751
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1035
00:27:47.751 --> 00:27:49.040
<v Speaker 5>he seemed like a crazy dude,</v>

1036
00:27:49.041 --> 00:27:50.540
<v Speaker 5>but everybody wants to be president.</v>

1037
00:27:50.541 --> 00:27:50.980
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>

1038
00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:51.221
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1039
00:27:51.221 --> 00:27:51.351
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

1040
00:27:51.351 --> 00:27:51.671
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

1041
00:27:51.671 --> 00:27:55.090
<v Speaker 4>what I'm saying with that is I've been around presidential politics a long time</v>

1042
00:27:55.091 --> 00:27:56.140
<v Speaker 4>and I studied that a lot of ways.</v>

1043
00:27:56.141 --> 00:27:58.600
<v Speaker 4>My rubicons in the Harvard BizLibrary okay.</v>

1044
00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:00.043
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1045
00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:01.271
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1046
00:28:01.271 --> 00:28:02.104
<v Speaker 4>it's that rate.</v>

1047
00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:02.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1048
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:03.820
<v Speaker 4>it is that Rick.</v>

1049
00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.073
<v Speaker 5>It's terrifying.</v>

1050
00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:07.213
<v Speaker 5>It's terrifying.</v>

1051
00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:11.170
<v Speaker 5>This is the freest country the world has ever known and it's,</v>

1052
00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:14.210
<v Speaker 5>it's been fucking hoodwinked by giant corporations.</v>

1053
00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:15.060
<v Speaker 4>We have been,</v>

1054
00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:15.800
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1055
00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:16.633
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1056
00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:17.481
<v Speaker 4>there was a guy,</v>

1057
00:28:17.481 --> 00:28:18.680
<v Speaker 4>I had a source,</v>

1058
00:28:18.681 --> 00:28:22.340
<v Speaker 4>somebody who was in a position to know when William Casey had his first briefing</v>

1059
00:28:22.341 --> 00:28:25.700
<v Speaker 4>as DCI director of central intelligence under Ronald Reagan would have been in</v>

1060
00:28:25.701 --> 00:28:26.870
<v Speaker 4>January of 81.</v>

1061
00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:28.430
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1062
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:29.900
<v Speaker 4>he said to those in the room,</v>

1063
00:28:29.901 --> 00:28:30.171
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>

1064
00:28:30.171 --> 00:28:33.800
<v Speaker 4>we will know that we have been successful when everything the American people</v>

1065
00:28:33.801 --> 00:28:35.630
<v Speaker 4>believe is true is false.</v>

1066
00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:37.723
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1067
00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:39.290
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

1068
00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:40.153
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1069
00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:43.010
<v Speaker 4>It's just amazing that this has sort of been,</v>

1070
00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:43.580
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1071
00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:46.670
<v Speaker 4>the way governments have done things since the beginning.</v>

1072
00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:51.320
<v Speaker 4>So like no one has ever like been straight with the people and had it all,</v>

1073
00:28:51.321 --> 00:28:52.154
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1074
00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.131
<v Speaker 5>even,</v>

1075
00:28:53.131 --> 00:28:53.681
<v Speaker 5>and I mean it,</v>

1076
00:28:53.681 --> 00:28:57.700
<v Speaker 5>has there ever been a culture ever that has been like completely cool as far as</v>

1077
00:28:57.701 --> 00:29:01.390
<v Speaker 5>the government goes and just watched the movie last night,</v>

1078
00:29:01.391 --> 00:29:04.120
<v Speaker 5>the cove and even in that movie was a movie about dolphins.</v>

1079
00:29:04.121 --> 00:29:08.290
<v Speaker 5>How much the Japanese government lied to the people about mercury poisoning.</v>

1080
00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:08.651
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1081
00:29:08.651 --> 00:29:12.090
<v Speaker 5>Well apparently that's what Shane Smith from vice.com was telling us about the,</v>

1082
00:29:12.091 --> 00:29:12.480
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1083
00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.760
<v Speaker 5>the knelt down a much more of a health issue.</v>

1084
00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:16.683
<v Speaker 4>Then the,</v>

1085
00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:20.060
<v Speaker 4>then the government is letting on all of that stuff is cooked.</v>

1086
00:29:20.061 --> 00:29:20.894
<v Speaker 4>But</v>

1087
00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:23.090
<v Speaker 4>the reason why,</v>

1088
00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:24.050
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>

1089
00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:24.200
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1090
00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.060
<v Speaker 4>let's take a quote quote from a Myer Rothchild.</v>

1091
00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:27.760
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1092
00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.020
<v Speaker 4>it was my senior Rothchild,</v>

1093
00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:32.240
<v Speaker 4>the guy who was a of the London house.</v>

1094
00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:33.151
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>

1095
00:29:33.151 --> 00:29:33.500
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

1096
00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:34.010
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

1097
00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:36.410
<v Speaker 4>give me control of a nation's currency.</v>

1098
00:29:36.411 --> 00:29:39.710
<v Speaker 4>It's money and I care not who passes its laws,</v>

1099
00:29:39.711 --> 00:29:40.491
<v Speaker 4>who governs it.</v>

1100
00:29:40.491 --> 00:29:41.324
<v Speaker 4>It's</v>

1101
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:43.030
<v Speaker 3>the infinite growth.</v>

1102
00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:46.060
<v Speaker 3>And look at what we're seeing around us with the economic collapse,</v>

1103
00:29:46.061 --> 00:29:48.490
<v Speaker 3>the endless fucking corruption.</v>

1104
00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:49.320
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1105
00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.520
<v Speaker 3>it killed me when all was going down,</v>

1106
00:29:51.521 --> 00:29:55.280
<v Speaker 3>when the bailouts were happening and Obama actually had the nerve to say that</v>

1107
00:29:55.281 --> 00:29:57.640
<v Speaker 3>there was going to limit the bonuses,</v>

1108
00:29:57.641 --> 00:30:00.100
<v Speaker 3>that these guys got to half a million dollars.</v>

1109
00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:05.480
<v Speaker 5>You like w as if someone actually talked him into thinking that that made any</v>

1110
00:30:07.231 --> 00:30:09.360
<v Speaker 5>sense to regular people.</v>

1111
00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:11.100
<v Speaker 5>The regular people going to go set up.</v>

1112
00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:11.551
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1113
00:30:11.551 --> 00:30:11.851
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1114
00:30:11.851 --> 00:30:13.290
<v Speaker 5>he had to get his half a mill.</v>

1115
00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:14.153
<v Speaker 5>He had to get,</v>

1116
00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:16.740
<v Speaker 5>the bank is falling apart.</v>

1117
00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:20.910
<v Speaker 5>People are bailing out the bank with their tax dollars and then somehow or</v>

1118
00:30:20.911 --> 00:30:21.151
<v Speaker 5>another,</v>

1119
00:30:21.151 --> 00:30:24.930
<v Speaker 5>it's rig in the way that the CEOs get bonuses.</v>

1120
00:30:24.931 --> 00:30:25.201
<v Speaker 5>What,</v>

1121
00:30:25.201 --> 00:30:25.350
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

1122
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.890
<v Speaker 5>How could that,</v>

1123
00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:26.221
<v Speaker 5>what did,</v>

1124
00:30:26.221 --> 00:30:29.910
<v Speaker 5>what does that bonus based on those who win in a rigged game get stupid?</v>

1125
00:30:29.911 --> 00:30:33.990
<v Speaker 5>Barack Obama thinks people believe that he actually killed Osama bin.</v>

1126
00:30:33.991 --> 00:30:34.824
<v Speaker 5>Fucking Loddon.</v>

1127
00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:36.420
<v Speaker 5>Nobody believes it.</v>

1128
00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:37.440
<v Speaker 5>I don't believe it.</v>

1129
00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:38.160
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1130
00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.120
<v Speaker 5>I'm not convinced.</v>

1131
00:30:39.121 --> 00:30:39.480
<v Speaker 5>There's too,</v>

1132
00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.880
<v Speaker 5>I've talked to too many military people that don't believe it.</v>

1133
00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:43.230
<v Speaker 5>I've talked to people that,</v>

1134
00:30:43.231 --> 00:30:43.470
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1135
00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:45.450
<v Speaker 5>probably shouldn't be talking about it and they're like,</v>

1136
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:46.670
<v Speaker 5>this is fucking horseshit.</v>

1137
00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:48.440
<v Speaker 5>We know that that guy has been dead for years now.</v>

1138
00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:49.381
<v Speaker 5>This will please.</v>

1139
00:30:49.381 --> 00:30:49.591
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1140
00:30:49.591 --> 00:30:50.424
<v Speaker 5>it was fire up.</v>

1141
00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:54.360
<v Speaker 5>You can take a shit on the floor if you want your Michael Ruber do whatever you</v>

1142
00:30:54.361 --> 00:30:56.730
<v Speaker 5>gotta do buddy want you to be comfortable?</v>

1143
00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:57.170
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1144
00:30:57.170 --> 00:30:58.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty impressed that he's smoking because,</v>

1145
00:30:58.861 --> 00:30:59.730
<v Speaker 3>and then maybe collapse.</v>

1146
00:30:59.731 --> 00:31:02.510
<v Speaker 3>He smoked probably like a carton in the first 10 minutes.</v>

1147
00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:03.040
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1148
00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.770
<v Speaker 3>that's Chris Smith.</v>

1149
00:31:04.771 --> 00:31:07.650
<v Speaker 3>The director loved that film noire effect and I can do the sexy thing,</v>

1150
00:31:07.651 --> 00:31:08.970

1152
00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:11.800
<v Speaker 5>It gets more doom and gloom.</v>

1153
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:13.270
<v Speaker 5>If you got it work at,</v>

1154
00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:13.780
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:22.870
<v Speaker 5>There's no additives to that at all.</v>

1162
00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.870

1164
00:31:30.461 --> 00:31:32.020
<v Speaker 5>government said we're cool with that.</v>

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:37.920
<v Speaker 5>Well we have cigarettes and cigarettes are pretty addictive but you know we came</v>

1169
00:31:37.921 --> 00:31:41.050
<v Speaker 5>out with some way to really fuck with your neurotransmitters and make it like</v>

1170

<v Speaker 5>Let me,</v>

1173
00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:47.290
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1174
00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:49.630
<v Speaker 5>I saw commercials like the Gulf's coming back and they're,</v>

1175
00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:52.150
<v Speaker 5>they're serving shrimp and I'm looking at them like they're bombs.</v>

1176
00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:54.160
<v Speaker 5>Those sliding a shrimp bomb your way.</v>

1177
00:31:54.161 --> 00:31:54.710
<v Speaker 5>Like what is,</v>

1178
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:56.650
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is that man?</v>

1179
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:57.940
<v Speaker 5>I hope it's okay.</v>

1180
00:31:57.941 --> 00:31:58.890
<v Speaker 5>But Jesus Christ,</v>

1181
00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.820
<v Speaker 5>how did they fix that all wheel problem?</v>

1182
00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:01.860
<v Speaker 5>Cause I heard they didn't,</v>

1183
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:03.310
<v Speaker 5>I heard there's a new slick,</v>

1184
00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:05.320
<v Speaker 5>I heard that people have seen other slicks,</v>

1185
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:05.891
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1186
00:32:05.891 --> 00:32:06.221
<v Speaker 5>did they,</v>

1187
00:32:06.221 --> 00:32:07.840
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's completely capped off,</v>

1188
00:32:07.841 --> 00:32:08.061
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1189
00:32:08.061 --> 00:32:08.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1190
00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:08.531
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1191
00:32:08.531 --> 00:32:08.771
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1192
00:32:08.771 --> 00:32:08.980
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

1193
00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:09.291
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

1194
00:32:09.291 --> 00:32:09.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1195
00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:10.031
<v Speaker 3>I had a good friend,</v>

1196
00:32:10.031 --> 00:32:11.470
<v Speaker 3>Matthew seven scary,</v>

1197
00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.030
<v Speaker 3>a colleague who was a,</v>

1198
00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:13.451
<v Speaker 3>had been,</v>

1199
00:32:13.451 --> 00:32:15.910
<v Speaker 3>he had been the world's largest energy investment banker and he was a colleague</v>

1200
00:32:15.911 --> 00:32:17.920
<v Speaker 3>of mine in the peak oil movement for many years.</v>

1201
00:32:17.921 --> 00:32:18.754
<v Speaker 3>He died,</v>

1202
00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:20.223
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1203
00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:21.820
<v Speaker 3>I won't say that yet,</v>

1204
00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:22.683
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>

1205
00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:24.760
<v Speaker 3>he died under mysterious circumstances to me.</v>

1206
00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:25.600
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1207
00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.040
<v Speaker 3>but he knew all about the golf and,</v>

1208
00:32:28.041 --> 00:32:29.640
<v Speaker 3>and it was a total blowout.</v>

1209
00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:32.290
<v Speaker 3>Know the seabed is destroyed.</v>

1210
00:32:32.291 --> 00:32:33.550
<v Speaker 3>He was telling the truth there.</v>

1211
00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:36.690
<v Speaker 3>There's the shaft from deep water rise and it went down.</v>

1212
00:32:36.691 --> 00:32:37.030
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1213
00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:38.200
<v Speaker 3>and what's happened is,</v>

1214
00:32:38.201 --> 00:32:38.411
<v Speaker 3>is it,</v>

1215
00:32:38.411 --> 00:32:40.490
<v Speaker 3>the whole bed is now fractured</v>

1216
00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:42.140
<v Speaker 5>all around it and it's,</v>

1217
00:32:42.141 --> 00:32:44.360
<v Speaker 5>the oil is seeping up and there's no way,</v>

1218
00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.800
<v Speaker 5>there's no way to control it.</v>

1219
00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:46.820
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

1220
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:49.790
<v Speaker 5>So terrifying.</v>

1221
00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:50.031
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1222
00:32:50.031 --> 00:32:53.600
<v Speaker 5>I was in New Orleans for the first time recently and I really,</v>

1223
00:32:53.601 --> 00:32:54.740
<v Speaker 5>really enjoyed it.</v>

1224
00:32:54.741 --> 00:32:56.030
<v Speaker 5>Like what an unusual,</v>

1225
00:32:56.031 --> 00:32:56.421
<v Speaker 5>shitty,</v>

1226
00:32:56.421 --> 00:32:58.550
<v Speaker 5>what an amazing city really is.</v>

1227
00:32:58.551 --> 00:33:02.930
<v Speaker 5>One of the last few places that has its own true identity.</v>

1228
00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:03.681
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1229
00:33:03.681 --> 00:33:04.680
<v Speaker 5>when we're hanging around,</v>

1230
00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:06.740
<v Speaker 5>it was like what a great place it is.</v>

1231
00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:09.050
<v Speaker 5>And that's where I saw CIA bringing drugs into the country.</v>

1232
00:33:09.051 --> 00:33:09.300
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

1233
00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:11.900
<v Speaker 5>that's why I where I became an eyeball wit to it.</v>

1234
00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:12.883
<v Speaker 5>Jesus,</v>

1235
00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:13.970
<v Speaker 5>you northern.</v>

1236
00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:14.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1237
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:18.020
<v Speaker 5>New Orleans got some Mojo in New Orleans and fun place,</v>

1238
00:33:18.021 --> 00:33:18.854
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1239
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:20.060
<v Speaker 5>That's a fun place.</v>

1240
00:33:20.061 --> 00:33:21.530
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like it's another country.</v>

1241
00:33:21.531 --> 00:33:23.480
<v Speaker 5>Like you should have to have a passport to get there.</v>

1242
00:33:23.481 --> 00:33:23.901
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're,</v>

1243
00:33:23.901 --> 00:33:25.040
<v Speaker 5>you're going to another country.</v>

1244
00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:29.450
<v Speaker 5>It's very strange or affected those poor people get hit by that man,</v>

1245
00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:29.870
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1246
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:30.890
<v Speaker 5>after Katrina,</v>

1247
00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:32.650
<v Speaker 5>then they get hit by that and then,</v>

1248
00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:33.440
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1249
00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:34.820
<v Speaker 5>wha how is the ocean now?</v>

1250
00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:35.990
<v Speaker 5>I mean so much ocean.</v>

1251
00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:38.240
<v Speaker 5>How long does it take the sea bed is the issue,</v>

1252
00:33:38.241 --> 00:33:38.421
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1253
00:33:38.421 --> 00:33:39.254
<v Speaker 5>Is that what it is?</v>

1254
00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.610
<v Speaker 5>It'll destroy the food chain because you're,</v>

1255
00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:42.090
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1256
00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:44.720
<v Speaker 5>as if they had just stopped what would got into the ocean,</v>

1257
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:46.220
<v Speaker 5>the ocean would probably absorb it all.</v>

1258
00:33:46.221 --> 00:33:47.360
<v Speaker 5>Cause it's so enormous.</v>

1259
00:33:47.361 --> 00:33:49.310
<v Speaker 5>Well of course they were lying about the quantity.</v>

1260
00:33:49.311 --> 00:33:49.550
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1261
00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:49.911
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1262
00:33:49.911 --> 00:33:50.744
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1263
00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:53.570
<v Speaker 5>I had known it was over a hundred thousand barrels a day early on and,</v>

1264
00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:55.463
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1265
00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:55.761
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1266
00:33:55.761 --> 00:33:56.121
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

1267
00:33:56.121 --> 00:33:57.260
<v Speaker 5>it was much higher than that one,</v>

1268
00:33:57.261 --> 00:34:00.830
<v Speaker 5>but a couple of points and that's never been really fixed.</v>

1269
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:03.980
<v Speaker 5>That's the problem with this whole paradigm at that Fukushima.</v>

1270
00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:04.731
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1271
00:34:04.731 --> 00:34:06.860
<v Speaker 5>Japan is mortally wounded with radiation,</v>

1272
00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:07.130
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1273
00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:08.020
<v Speaker 5>collapsed that my side,</v>

1274
00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:09.410
<v Speaker 5>we have been documenting,</v>

1275
00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:10.071
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1276
00:34:10.071 --> 00:34:11.570
<v Speaker 5>tens,</v>

1277
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:12.021
<v Speaker 5>hundreds of thousands of times,</v>

1278
00:34:12.021 --> 00:34:15.080
<v Speaker 5>greater levels of radiation released over broader distances.</v>

1279
00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:16.040
<v Speaker 5>Cesium,</v>

1280
00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:16.550
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1281
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:20.180
<v Speaker 5>there's been a spike in mortality in the U S as a result of Fukushima,</v>

1282
00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:25.420
<v Speaker 5>the 35% spike in a neonatal mortality,</v>

1283
00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:26.240
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1284
00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:29.420
<v Speaker 5>right after Fukushima in Japan here,</v>

1285
00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:30.830
<v Speaker 5>Pacific northwest,</v>

1286
00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:31.880
<v Speaker 5>San Francisco,</v>

1287
00:34:31.881 --> 00:34:32.714
<v Speaker 5>north.</v>

1288
00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:33.733
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1289
00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:34.320
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1290
00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:34.661
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1291
00:34:34.661 --> 00:34:34.941
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1292
00:34:34.941 --> 00:34:39.200
<v Speaker 5>and Japan is mortally wounded with radiation and the global food supply is now</v>

1293
00:34:39.201 --> 00:34:41.090
<v Speaker 5>contaminated as a result of the cesium,</v>

1294
00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:42.080
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1295
00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.250
<v Speaker 5>the plutonium and,</v>

1296
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.390
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1297
00:34:43.390 --> 00:34:43.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1298
00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:47.350
<v Speaker 5>baby food was just found detected the other day with a radiation.</v>

1299
00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:47.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1300
00:34:47.910 --> 00:34:49.310
<v Speaker 5>Really in Japan or in America?</v>

1301
00:34:49.311 --> 00:34:49.761
<v Speaker 5>Japan.</v>

1302
00:34:49.761 --> 00:34:52.040
<v Speaker 5>But that could have been easily sent to America.</v>

1303
00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:53.150
<v Speaker 5>Do we buy their baby food?</v>

1304
00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:54.043
<v Speaker 5>I hope not.</v>

1305
00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:56.083
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1306
00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:57.720
<v Speaker 5>So how many fix that is it?</v>

1307
00:34:57.721 --> 00:34:59.270
<v Speaker 5>Is it possible to fix that area?</v>

1308
00:34:59.271 --> 00:35:00.051
<v Speaker 5>That area is fucked,</v>

1309
00:35:00.051 --> 00:35:00.860
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1310
00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:01.470
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1311
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:04.580
<v Speaker 5>it's going to go through the ground for the next 30 or 40,000 years.</v>

1312
00:35:04.581 --> 00:35:06.360
<v Speaker 5>That's the half life of cesium.</v>

1313
00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.410
<v Speaker 5>So it's okay.</v>

1314
00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.160
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

1315
00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:10.311
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1316
00:35:10.311 --> 00:35:10.551
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

1317
00:35:10.551 --> 00:35:11.960
<v Speaker 5>it's permanently um,</v>

1318
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.890
<v Speaker 5>unusable.</v>

1319
00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:13.320
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1320
00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:13.680
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1321
00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:18.560
<v Speaker 5>and what they're finding is that the birds have a heavy Eaton radioactive seeds</v>

1322
00:35:18.561 --> 00:35:22.220
<v Speaker 5>and they're shitting out radioactive poop all over New Zealand now.</v>

1323
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:23.090
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

1324
00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:26.900
<v Speaker 5>And so that's a mortal wound to the global economy.</v>

1325
00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:31.140
<v Speaker 5>That's what we do at collapse collapse,</v>

1326
00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:34.370
<v Speaker 5>that I bring all this stuff all together so we can get a real picture of how bad</v>

1327
00:35:34.371 --> 00:35:35.210
<v Speaker 5>things really are.</v>

1328
00:35:35.211 --> 00:35:38.640
<v Speaker 5>So is it safe to say the collapse that is the last place you should go?</v>

1329
00:35:38.641 --> 00:35:40.740
<v Speaker 5>If you thinking about getting some sleep,</v>

<v Speaker 5>We could grow our own shit.</v>

1364
00:36:35.161 --> 00:36:35.491
<v Speaker 5>We could,</v>

1365
00:36:35.491 --> 00:36:35.761
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1366
00:36:35.761 --> 00:36:36.930
<v Speaker 5>we could form a community.</v>

1367
00:36:36.931 --> 00:36:38.160
<v Speaker 5>Just take this somewhere else.</v>

<v Speaker 5>We'll wake up.</v>

1379
00:36:52.371 --> 00:36:52.771
<v Speaker 5>Could have been,</v>

1380
00:36:52.771 --> 00:36:57.180
<v Speaker 5>but the idea behind it to have a community will not wake up.</v>

1381
00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:58.800
<v Speaker 5>Why is it always go bad man?</v>

<v Speaker 5>houses.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I mean is you can't avoid that.</v>

1400
00:37:25.741 --> 00:37:29.280
<v Speaker 5>We've been watching all of these crimes taking place right in front of us,</v>

1401
00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:30.481
<v Speaker 5>all our lives.</v>

1402
00:37:30.481 --> 00:37:31.314
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

1403
00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.010
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1404
00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:37.010
<v Speaker 5>2000 election was stolen right in front of our eyes and we didn't do anything.</v>

1405
00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:38.131
<v Speaker 5>And that's,</v>

1406
00:37:38.131 --> 00:37:38.520
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1407

1413
00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.250
<v Speaker 5>But one of my biggest anger is if,</v>

1414
00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:47.800
<v Speaker 5>if you don't only listen to him,</v>

1415
00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:49.470
<v Speaker 5>to me 30 years ago,</v>

1416
00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:50.423
<v Speaker 5>this might not happen.</v>

1417
00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:52.260
<v Speaker 5>If you'd listened to Iran Contra people,</v>

1418
00:37:52.261 --> 00:37:53.280
<v Speaker 5>if you'd listen to,</v>

1419
00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:54.150
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1420

1424
00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:02.690
<v Speaker 5>2003 invasion of nobody,</v>

1425
00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:07.780
<v Speaker 5>there's this country never mustered the will to call the crimes out when they</v>

1426
00:38:07.921 --> 00:38:10.980
<v Speaker 5>saw him cause they were there for everybody to see.</v>

1427
00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:12.180
<v Speaker 5>And now we're all kind of go,</v>

1428
00:38:12.181 --> 00:38:13.770
<v Speaker 5>oh well yeah of course of that happened.</v>

1429
00:38:13.771 --> 00:38:17.550
<v Speaker 5>And of course that happened and it's amazing how this is all predicted by the</v>

1430
00:38:17.551 --> 00:38:18.570
<v Speaker 5>founding fathers.</v>

1431
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.931
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1432
00:38:18.931 --> 00:38:19.201
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

1433
00:38:19.201 --> 00:38:21.900
<v Speaker 5>they knew that everything was going to get slippery and things is going to get</v>

1434
00:38:21.901 --> 00:38:22.260
<v Speaker 5>weird.</v>

1435
00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:26.730
<v Speaker 5>The fact that Benjamin Franklin Franklin was the one who said he who chooses</v>

1436
00:38:26.731 --> 00:38:29.190
<v Speaker 5>security over liberty deserves neither.</v>

1437
00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:31.553
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

1438
00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:32.760
<v Speaker 5>they did understand.</v>

1439
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:34.440
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing that they figured it out.</v>

1440
00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:37.150
<v Speaker 5>But then if you go back,</v>

1441
00:38:37.151 --> 00:38:37.601
<v Speaker 5>especially,</v>

1442

1444
00:38:40.031 --> 00:38:40.780
<v Speaker 5>you need a revolution.</v>

1445

1447
00:38:44.021 --> 00:38:45.710
<v Speaker 5>Start over again and you know,</v>

00:38:47.891 --> 00:38:49.150
<v Speaker 5>can we just all get along?</v>

1450
00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:51.270
<v Speaker 5>Why can't we all just get along and how good.</v>

1451
00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:52.690
<v Speaker 5>How about these concert running the world?</v>

1452
00:38:52.691 --> 00:38:55.400
<v Speaker 5>Just get their shit together without us having to know what,</v>

1453
00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:56.440
<v Speaker 5>you don't rise up,</v>

1454
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:57.400
<v Speaker 5>can't you guys evolve?</v>

1455
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:58.360
<v Speaker 5>They're going to have to die off.</v>

1456
00:38:58.361 --> 00:38:58.540
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1457
00:38:58.540 --> 00:38:59.890
<v Speaker 5>The older ones are going to have to die off.</v>

1458
00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.360
<v Speaker 5>They're just way too set in their ways.</v>

1459
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:05.200
<v Speaker 5>The people that were willing to call Waco and actually have that happen,</v>

1460
00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:08.320
<v Speaker 5>they didn't understand the impact of the media because it hadn't really become</v>

1461
00:39:08.321 --> 00:39:08.950
<v Speaker 5>apparent yet.</v>

1462
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:09.400
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1463
00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:10.001
<v Speaker 5>they didn't know.</v>

1464
00:39:10.001 --> 00:39:12.340
<v Speaker 5>They thought they were going to get away with business as usual because they</v>

1465
00:39:12.341 --> 00:39:16.030
<v Speaker 5>come from a long career of doing that and that's just how to get shit done.</v>

1466
00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.850
<v Speaker 5>They didn't think that there was going to be a video camera that was going to</v>

1467
00:39:18.851 --> 00:39:21.280
<v Speaker 5>take film footage of it and making it into a documentary,</v>

1468
00:39:21.281 --> 00:39:24.880
<v Speaker 5>explain everything and show it in slow motion in great detail is that it never</v>

1469
00:39:24.881 --> 00:39:25.714
<v Speaker 5>been done before,</v>

1470
00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:28.960
<v Speaker 5>but it's done and you want to see it once.</v>

1471
00:39:28.961 --> 00:39:29.320
<v Speaker 5>You know.</v>

1472
00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:34.320
<v Speaker 5>That's actually a good point for the way media and all this gear has been useful</v>

1473
00:39:35.201 --> 00:39:37.030
<v Speaker 5>in the occupy movement around the world.</v>

1474
00:39:37.031 --> 00:39:41.320
<v Speaker 5>I mean the anonymous is out there kicking ass right now,</v>

1475
00:39:41.321 --> 00:39:41.681
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1476
00:39:41.681 --> 00:39:42.850
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

1477
00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:44.290
<v Speaker 5>and and so this,</v>

1478
00:39:44.291 --> 00:39:47.920
<v Speaker 5>this is kind of a dimension which I think is fucking movie.</v>

1479
00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:48.331
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>

1480
00:39:48.331 --> 00:39:49.000
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>

1481
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:49.370
<v Speaker 5>oh yes,</v>

1482
00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:49.961
<v Speaker 5>it's a movie.</v>

1483
00:39:49.961 --> 00:39:51.940
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is a great action film right now.</v>

1484
00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:54.280
<v Speaker 5>So a lot of crazy shit going down.</v>

1485
00:39:54.281 --> 00:39:54.431

<v Speaker 3>I mean it's right.</v>

1498
00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:16.380
<v Speaker 3>It's like I can't believe some of the crazy stuff I'm seeing right now.</v>

1499
00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:18.680
<v Speaker 5>Where's it all going to end?</v>

1500
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:19.101
<v Speaker 5>Does it,</v>

1501

<v Speaker 5>is there a real abi,</v>

1503
00:40:20.901 --> 00:40:23.420
<v Speaker 5>you've been really good at predicting a lot of shit,</v>

1504
00:40:23.421 --> 00:40:23.721
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1505
00:40:23.721 --> 00:40:24.081
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

1506
00:40:24.081 --> 00:40:29.081
<v Speaker 5>you predicted like pretty much every single big economic event that's happened.</v>

1507
00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:29.750
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

1508
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:32.600
<v Speaker 5>you were on that before you were right with Peter Schiff.</v>

1509
00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:33.741
<v Speaker 5>You were on that,</v>

1510
00:40:33.741 --> 00:40:36.110
<v Speaker 5>you were predicting that stuff like way back in the day.</v>

1511
00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:38.630
<v Speaker 5>What do you see now when you looking at it now,</v>

1512
00:40:38.631 --> 00:40:38.901
<v Speaker 5>what do you,</v>

1513
00:40:38.901 --> 00:40:39.830
<v Speaker 5>where do you see it end?</v>

1514
00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:41.510
<v Speaker 5>What's your prediction for how it ends?</v>

1515
00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:41.931
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1516
00:40:41.931 --> 00:40:46.370
<v Speaker 5>We're are rather comes to a balance again where we are,</v>

1517
00:40:46.371 --> 00:40:46.561
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

1518
00:40:46.561 --> 00:40:46.610
<v Speaker 5>right</v>

1519
00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:47.270
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

1520
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:49.550
<v Speaker 3>where we are right now is like,</v>

1521
00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:50.330
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1522
00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:53.870
<v Speaker 3>the mega and to climax at the end of act two.</v>

1523
00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:54.883
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1524
00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:56.203
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1525
00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.313
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1526
00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:59.600
<v Speaker 3>the global economy is imploding right now.</v>

1527
00:40:59.601 --> 00:41:00.740
<v Speaker 3>Europe is dead,</v>

1528
00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:05.600
<v Speaker 3>and there's 1.4 Quillian quadrillion dollars in derivatives out there that are</v>

1529
00:41:05.601 --> 00:41:07.970
<v Speaker 3>imploding because money,</v>

1530
00:41:07.971 --> 00:41:08.390
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

1531
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:09.380
<v Speaker 3>like I said in the movie,</v>

1532
00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:10.970
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what I,</v>

1533
00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.470
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly the point I was on it.</v>

1534
00:41:12.471 --> 00:41:12.680
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

1535
00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:12.981
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

1536
00:41:12.981 --> 00:41:13.814
<v Speaker 3>this is spooky.</v>

1537
00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:14.870
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

1538
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:15.703
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>

1539
00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:16.371
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>

1540
00:41:16.371 --> 00:41:17.270
<v Speaker 3>it has no power.</v>

1541
00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:21.020
<v Speaker 3>Money only has power because of energy and resources.</v>

1542
00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:22.393
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

1543
00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.320
<v Speaker 3>And you can print an infinite amount of money,</v>

1544
00:41:24.321 --> 00:41:28.250
<v Speaker 3>but we live on a finite planet and we're running out of all the stuff that makes</v>

1545
00:41:28.251 --> 00:41:28.671
<v Speaker 3>that money,</v>

1546
00:41:28.671 --> 00:41:29.481
<v Speaker 3>have any power.</v>

1547
00:41:29.481 --> 00:41:31.250
<v Speaker 3>The money itself has no power.</v>

1548
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:35.210
<v Speaker 3>And that's the adjustment that's,</v>

1549
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:37.620
<v Speaker 3>that's civilization is collapsing.</v>

1550
00:41:37.621 --> 00:41:39.830
<v Speaker 3>There are 6 billion people living here now,</v>

1551
00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:41.780
<v Speaker 3>only because of cheap energy.</v>

1552
00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:47.810
<v Speaker 3>And our population has gone straight like that since the discovery of oil.</v>

1553
00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:50.180
<v Speaker 3>And it always goes like that and then crashes.</v>

1554
00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:50.900
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

1555
00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:52.490
<v Speaker 3>we're on the cusp of the crash right now.</v>

1556
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:53.151
<v Speaker 3>You see,</v>

1557
00:41:53.151 --> 00:41:54.110
<v Speaker 3>you think we're at a cost of,</v>

1558
00:41:54.111 --> 00:41:54.620
<v Speaker 3>not of,</v>

1559
00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:57.320
<v Speaker 3>not just of a economical labs,</v>

1560
00:41:57.321 --> 00:41:59.810
<v Speaker 3>but a biological disaster thing.</v>

1561
00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:01.190
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1562
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.581
<v Speaker 3>what does,</v>

1563
00:42:01.581 --> 00:42:01.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1564
00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:03.620
<v Speaker 3>how are you going to get rid of that many people?</v>

1565
00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:04.460
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1566
00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:05.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1567
00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:05.923
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

1568
00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:07.053
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1569
00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:07.430
<v Speaker 3>Gee,</v>

1570
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:08.110
<v Speaker 3>you can let,</v>

1571
00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:09.230
<v Speaker 3>let all the radiation,</v>

1572
00:42:09.231 --> 00:42:10.220
<v Speaker 3>how to Focus Shima.</v>

1573
00:42:10.221 --> 00:42:12.080
<v Speaker 3>You can let all the oil out of the,</v>

1574
00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:15.920
<v Speaker 3>the Gulf or you can let a billions of tons of methane.</v>

1575
00:42:15.921 --> 00:42:17.570
<v Speaker 3>There's now being released from the,</v>

1576
00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:18.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1577
00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:19.970
<v Speaker 3>Tundra and Arctic Siberia.</v>

1578
00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:20.901
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1579
00:42:20.901 --> 00:42:22.410
<v Speaker 3>it's a catastrophic event for,</v>

1580
00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:22.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1581
00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:22.870
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1582
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:23.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1583
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:24.290
<v Speaker 3>to a tipping point.</v>

1584
00:42:24.291 --> 00:42:26.210
<v Speaker 3>We've destroyed the environment as well.</v>

1585
00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:27.830
<v Speaker 3>That's going to kill a lot of people,</v>

1586
00:42:27.831 --> 00:42:31.490
<v Speaker 3>but there are 10 calories of hydrocarbon energy and every calorie of food</v>

1587
00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:33.260
<v Speaker 3>consumed in the industrialized world,</v>

1588
00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:34.670
<v Speaker 3>the energy's going away.</v>

1589
00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:35.451
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1590
00:42:35.451 --> 00:42:36.290
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

1591
00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:39.470
<v Speaker 3>the top soil used to grow food on is nothing but dust.</v>

1592
00:42:39.471 --> 00:42:40.310
<v Speaker 3>It's a sponge on,</v>

1593
00:42:40.311 --> 00:42:43.280
<v Speaker 3>on which they pour chemicals made from oil and natural gas.</v>

1594
00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:45.650
<v Speaker 3>So People gonna Starve to death.</v>

1595
00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:47.660
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

1596
00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.530
<v Speaker 3>So it should have never got this crazy in the first place.</v>

1597
00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:53.090
<v Speaker 3>We got way ahead of ourselves.</v>

1598
00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:58.280
<v Speaker 3>Technology got far enough ahead that we could support gigantic groups of people</v>

1599
00:42:58.281 --> 00:43:00.590
<v Speaker 3>and we sorta like bought a car on credit.</v>

1600
00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:02.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to mess with your mind.</v>

1601
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:03.110
<v Speaker 3>Please do.</v>

1602
00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:06.740
<v Speaker 3>I want to stand by the people that do this.</v>

1603
00:43:06.741 --> 00:43:09.980
<v Speaker 3>The people that run the infinite growth monetary paradigm system,</v>

1604
00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:15.610
<v Speaker 3>which to identify now I would say would be the owners of the Federal Reserve,</v>

1605
00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.280
<v Speaker 3>the Bank of international settlements in the city of London.</v>

1606
00:43:19.281 --> 00:43:20.210
<v Speaker 3>Let's start there.</v>

1607
00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:21.920
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1608
00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:26.860
<v Speaker 3>they've known that this outcome was coming for a long time and are there at</v>

1609
00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:29.240
<v Speaker 3>their engineering and they are making money from this.</v>

1610
00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:33.960
<v Speaker 3>Now the sick bastards are deliberately letting things crash.</v>

1611
00:43:33.961 --> 00:43:35.180
<v Speaker 3>So they've engineered it,</v>

1612
00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:36.620
<v Speaker 3>they're profiting from it.</v>

1613
00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.210
<v Speaker 3>And then when it crashes,</v>

1614
00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:39.680
<v Speaker 3>what happens then if,</v>

1615
00:43:39.681 --> 00:43:39.951
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

1616
00:43:39.951 --> 00:43:40.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean do,</v>

1617
00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:40.850
<v Speaker 3>does,</v>

1618
00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:45.020
<v Speaker 3>does it crash to a point where money is useless and we start all over again or</v>

1619
00:43:45.021 --> 00:43:49.130
<v Speaker 3>it crashes to the point where we have a thermal nuclear war that we're on the</v>

1620
00:43:49.131 --> 00:43:52.850
<v Speaker 3>cusp of right now over an invasion of Iran for bullshit reasons.</v>

1621
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:55.010
<v Speaker 3>A regime change in Syria,</v>

1622
00:43:55.011 --> 00:43:56.330
<v Speaker 3>which will bring in,</v>

1623
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.510
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1624
00:43:56.510 --> 00:44:00.260
<v Speaker 3>China immediately on a rand side and a thermo nuclear conflict.</v>

1625
00:44:00.261 --> 00:44:01.730
<v Speaker 3>We could blow ourselves to smithereens.</v>

1626
00:44:01.731 --> 00:44:02.750
<v Speaker 3>And why are we doing that?</v>

1627
00:44:02.751 --> 00:44:04.430
<v Speaker 3>Why are we even thinking about doing that?</v>

1628
00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:06.313
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1629
00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:08.870
<v Speaker 3>the parable of the Scorpion and the turtle.</v>

1630
00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:09.310
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1631
00:44:09.310 --> 00:44:09.760
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1632
00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:11.240
<v Speaker 3>Jesus ain't that one.</v>

1633
00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:13.610
<v Speaker 3>I use it all the time.</v>

1634
00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:13.941
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1635
00:44:13.941 --> 00:44:14.774
<v Speaker 3>you're not?</v>

1636
00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:15.470
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1637
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:15.980
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1638
00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:16.820
<v Speaker 3>There's scorpions.</v>

1639
00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:17.630
<v Speaker 3>They cannot,</v>

1640
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:18.950
<v Speaker 3>that's all they know how to do,</v>

1641
00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:21.200
<v Speaker 3>make money on the way up,</v>

1642
00:44:21.201 --> 00:44:22.430
<v Speaker 3>make money on the way down.</v>

1643
00:44:22.431 --> 00:44:25.880
<v Speaker 3>And this is pure evil because they know what the outcome of this is.</v>

1644
00:44:25.881 --> 00:44:29.390
<v Speaker 3>They know that the outcome of their actions would be either through climate</v>

1645
00:44:29.391 --> 00:44:31.590
<v Speaker 3>change to kill all life on this planet,</v>

1646
00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 3>which is</v>

1647
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:32.580
<v Speaker 5>well underway.</v>

1648
00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:33.450
<v Speaker 5>We're having a massive,</v>

1649
00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:33.750
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1650
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:34.890
<v Speaker 5>mass extinctions now,</v>

1651
00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:36.090
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1652
00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:37.950
<v Speaker 5>run it economically into the ground,</v>

1653
00:44:37.951 --> 00:44:38.784
<v Speaker 5>polluted,</v>

1654
00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:39.510
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1655
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:41.850
<v Speaker 5>blow everything up there doing all of that.</v>

1656
00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:45.683
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1657
00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:48.810
<v Speaker 6>And for those who weren't aware of the parable of the Scorpion and the toads,</v>

1658
00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.350
<v Speaker 6>the Scorpion asked the toad to give them right across the water.</v>

1659
00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:53.700
<v Speaker 6>And the toad says,</v>

1660
00:44:53.701 --> 00:44:54.391
<v Speaker 6>I can't do that.</v>

1661
00:44:54.391 --> 00:44:55.410
<v Speaker 6>You'll sting me and kill me.</v>

1662
00:44:55.411 --> 00:44:55.621
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

1663
00:44:55.621 --> 00:44:56.401
<v Speaker 6>why would I do that?</v>

1664
00:44:56.401 --> 00:44:56.611
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

1665
00:44:56.611 --> 00:44:57.061
<v Speaker 6>if I did that,</v>

1666
00:44:57.061 --> 00:44:57.930
<v Speaker 6>we would both drown.</v>

1667
00:44:58.530 --> 00:44:59.011
<v Speaker 6>So he goes,</v>

1668
00:44:59.011 --> 00:44:59.780
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

1669
00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:00.990
<v Speaker 6>And he gives him a ride,</v>

1670
00:45:00.991 --> 00:45:02.310
<v Speaker 6>and in the middle of the water,</v>

1671
00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:05.670
<v Speaker 6>the Scorpion stings him and he starts to die.</v>

1672
00:45:05.671 --> 00:45:06.070
<v Speaker 6>And he says,</v>

1673
00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:06.903
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck?</v>

1674
00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:08.040
<v Speaker 6>And the Scorpion says,</v>

1675
00:45:08.041 --> 00:45:08.940
<v Speaker 6>it's in my nature.</v>

1676
00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:09.893
<v Speaker 5>I'm a Scorpion,</v>

1677
00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:13.260
<v Speaker 5>doesn't Scorpion dying that awesome.</v>

1678
00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:13.630
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

1679
00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:14.300
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

1680
00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:14.810
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>

1681
00:45:14.810 --> 00:45:16.250
<v Speaker 5>And that's the point of this parable.</v>

1682
00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:17.040
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1683
00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:17.880
<v Speaker 5>it's ridiculous,</v>

1684
00:45:17.881 --> 00:45:19.410
<v Speaker 5>but it is what's going down,</v>

1685
00:45:19.411 --> 00:45:19.681
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1686
00:45:19.681 --> 00:45:20.070
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1687
00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:21.780
<v Speaker 5>no one thinks that this can go on forever.</v>

1688
00:45:21.781 --> 00:45:23.900
<v Speaker 5>Do they think that they could just ride the,</v>

1689
00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:24.271
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1690
00:45:24.271 --> 00:45:28.830
<v Speaker 5>the asteroid before impact and die like right before everything falls apart?</v>

1691
00:45:28.831 --> 00:45:33.130
<v Speaker 5>They're like 80 90 they're really not going to make it to 2020 or whenever it is</v>

1692
00:45:33.131 --> 00:45:34.960
<v Speaker 5>there on that backs there.</v>

1693
00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:35.310
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1694
00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:38.070
<v Speaker 5>it's supposed to be 2012 according to the Mayans,</v>

1695
00:45:38.071 --> 00:45:40.410
<v Speaker 5>but they couldn't even predict their own demise was silly boys,</v>

1696
00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:41.910
<v Speaker 5>those silly people.</v>

1697
00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:45.750
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of properties that are winding up coincidentally.</v>

1698
00:45:45.751 --> 00:45:46.290
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>

1699
00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:46.561
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1700
00:45:46.561 --> 00:45:48.930
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying I described or that I'm a detective.</v>

1701
00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:49.261
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1702
00:45:49.261 --> 00:45:49.561
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1703
00:45:49.561 --> 00:45:52.650
<v Speaker 5>I think it's really fascinating that to think that there could have been</v>

1704
00:45:52.651 --> 00:45:54.960
<v Speaker 5>alternate paths for intelligence.</v>

1705
00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:55.261
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1706
00:45:55.261 --> 00:45:55.471
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1707
00:45:55.471 --> 00:45:55.681
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1708
00:45:55.681 --> 00:46:00.570
<v Speaker 5>the path that Western civilization went on with our interpretation of reality</v>

1709
00:46:00.571 --> 00:46:03.720
<v Speaker 5>and our construction methods and all the different things that,</v>

1710
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:05.670
<v Speaker 5>the way that we have expressed our tech,</v>

1711
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:08.280
<v Speaker 5>our intelligence that it could very well be.</v>

1712
00:46:08.281 --> 00:46:12.180
<v Speaker 5>And it's been proven to be in Egypt and in the Mayans and the,</v>

1713
00:46:12.181 --> 00:46:12.661
<v Speaker 5>there was a,</v>

1714
00:46:12.661 --> 00:46:16.650
<v Speaker 5>there was an incredibly brilliant society that operated very,</v>

1715
00:46:16.651 --> 00:46:21.180
<v Speaker 5>very much different than ours and amazing different way to think while one</v>

1716
00:46:21.181 --> 00:46:21.481
<v Speaker 5>group,</v>

1717
00:46:21.481 --> 00:46:23.400
<v Speaker 5>part of the world was thinking about something else.</v>

1718
00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:28.020
<v Speaker 5>They were studying constellations and building these amazing stone structures</v>

1719
00:46:28.021 --> 00:46:29.260
<v Speaker 5>that really are,</v>

1720
00:46:29.261 --> 00:46:30.510
<v Speaker 5>are mind boggling.</v>

1721
00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:35.370
<v Speaker 5>And then when they find out that there's thousands of them still undiscovered in</v>

1722
00:46:35.371 --> 00:46:37.110
<v Speaker 5>Mexico and South America,</v>

1723
00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:38.240
<v Speaker 5>that they're just the,</v>

1724
00:46:38.241 --> 00:46:38.410
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1725
00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:39.910
<v Speaker 5>the trees grew over them.</v>

1726
00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:40.730
<v Speaker 5>But there was a,</v>

1727
00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:44.340
<v Speaker 5>a great culture down there and amazing culture,</v>

1728
00:46:44.341 --> 00:46:46.440
<v Speaker 5>completely alien to what exists right now.</v>

1729
00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:49.710
<v Speaker 5>And they operated on different operating system.</v>

1730
00:46:49.711 --> 00:46:50.544
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1731
00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:54.180
<v Speaker 5>as you were saying that I was having visions of first nations,</v>

1732
00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:54.810
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1733
00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:59.810
<v Speaker 5>native Americans having really essentially perfected their religion in that they</v>

1734
00:47:00.751 --> 00:47:01.430
<v Speaker 5>lived in a,</v>

1735
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:04.020
<v Speaker 5>in a very balanced way with their environment.</v>

1736
00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:05.183
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1737
00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:07.350
<v Speaker 5>but see that's a different operating system.</v>

1738
00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:11.160
<v Speaker 5>It's like a different vibration inside completely.</v>

1739
00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:12.160
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1740
00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:12.993
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1741
00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:15.960
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you've ever done any psychedelics or anything like that,</v>

1742
00:47:15.961 --> 00:47:18.290
<v Speaker 5>but it's kind of what you're going to like a DMT trip or something,</v>

1743
00:47:18.291 --> 00:47:18.560
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1744
00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:18.780
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1745
00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:23.780
<v Speaker 5>you see other dimensions and you become so much more aware of other realities</v>

1746
00:47:23.881 --> 00:47:24.714
<v Speaker 5>and other truths.</v>

1747
00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:27.750
<v Speaker 5>And really what I think what's happening now as,</v>

1748
00:47:27.751 --> 00:47:28.500
<v Speaker 5>as the old,</v>

1749
00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:30.130
<v Speaker 5>the infant paradigm is dying.</v>

1750
00:47:30.131 --> 00:47:31.300
<v Speaker 5>It's obviously dying.</v>

1751
00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:31.721
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1752
00:47:31.721 --> 00:47:35.680
<v Speaker 5>anybody who can't see the collapse of human industrial civilization now needs to</v>

1753
00:47:35.681 --> 00:47:36.630
<v Speaker 5>be Darwinian late.</v>

1754
00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:37.720
<v Speaker 5>Deselected I mean,</v>

1755
00:47:37.850 --> 00:47:39.100
<v Speaker 5>so how do we get through this?</v>

1756
00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:41.860
<v Speaker 5>Do we get through this without a die off or it has to be,</v>

1757
00:47:41.861 --> 00:47:42.910
<v Speaker 5>there has to be a die off.</v>

1758
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:46.540
<v Speaker 5>I think that the way we get through this,</v>

1759
00:47:46.541 --> 00:47:48.700
<v Speaker 5>first of all is to realize that there's no way,</v>

1760
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:49.510
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1761
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:49.991
<v Speaker 5>in other words,</v>

1762
00:47:49.991 --> 00:47:51.220
<v Speaker 5>for all 7 billion of us,</v>

1763
00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:52.310
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1764
00:47:52.310 --> 00:47:52.910
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1765
00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:53.350
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1766
00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:55.960
<v Speaker 5>so we've got to cut off the rest of the world and build up a fence.</v>

1767
00:47:55.961 --> 00:47:56.794
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1768
00:47:57.250 --> 00:47:57.640
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>

1769
00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:58.310
<v Speaker 5>not that either.</v>

1770
00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:00.640
<v Speaker 5>What you have to do is form your own communities of,</v>

1771
00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:01.110
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

1772
00:48:01.110 --> 00:48:01.480
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

1773
00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:01.861
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

1774
00:48:01.861 --> 00:48:03.880
<v Speaker 5>of people who have the same consciousness.</v>

1775
00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:05.200
<v Speaker 5>And you can do it in a big city.</v>

1776
00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:06.383
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1777
00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:08.020
<v Speaker 5>where I live in western on the county,</v>

1778
00:48:08.021 --> 00:48:10.240
<v Speaker 5>it's just rife with that or were like one of the,</v>

1779
00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:11.770
<v Speaker 5>one of the test beds for that.</v>

1780
00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:13.920
<v Speaker 5>So there's a Lotta a lot of hippie pussy.</v>

1781
00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:15.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1782
00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:15.893
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1783
00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:16.923
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1784
00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:18.310
<v Speaker 5>It's very important.</v>

1785
00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:20.980
<v Speaker 5>If you're going to have some sort of a cult,</v>

1786
00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:22.250
<v Speaker 5>you got to have hot hippie pussy.</v>

1787
00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:23.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1788
00:48:23.090 --> 00:48:23.430
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1789
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:25.420
<v Speaker 5>if you're going to start your own civilization out in the woods,</v>

1790
00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:26.051
<v Speaker 5>can't do it.</v>

1791
00:48:26.051 --> 00:48:26.884
<v Speaker 5>We just do</v>

1792
00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:28.780
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1793
00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:29.740
<v Speaker 5>Shit's going to get boring.</v>

1794
00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:30.380
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1795
00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:33.400
<v Speaker 5>and there really is a lot to be said for being very in touch with,</v>

1796
00:48:33.401 --> 00:48:33.550
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1797
00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:36.850
<v Speaker 5>with nature and the rhythms of the planet because once you become aware of</v>

1798
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:37.690
<v Speaker 5>themselves,</v>

1799
00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:38.920
<v Speaker 5>they're very essential and,</v>

1800
00:48:38.921 --> 00:48:39.910
<v Speaker 5>and they're very,</v>

1801
00:48:39.911 --> 00:48:40.300
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1802
00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:40.511
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1803
00:48:40.511 --> 00:48:44.260
<v Speaker 5>once you really start to plug into and connect with some of the life that goes</v>

1804
00:48:44.261 --> 00:48:44.560
<v Speaker 5>on,</v>

1805
00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:46.960
<v Speaker 5>but most people in the world don't have any clue about that.</v>

1806
00:48:46.961 --> 00:48:47.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1807
00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:51.070
<v Speaker 5>It would be nice if we could all like break off into like minded groups of</v>

1808
00:48:51.071 --> 00:48:52.180
<v Speaker 5>really nice people.</v>

1809
00:48:52.181 --> 00:48:55.900
<v Speaker 5>She would guarantee that your community would just be really fucking cool.</v>

1810
00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:56.510
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1811
00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:57.610
<v Speaker 5>no ego issues.</v>

1812
00:48:57.611 --> 00:48:59.320
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's had a few mushroom trips,</v>

1813
00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:00.310
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1814
00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:02.110
<v Speaker 5>you know people like to do yoga.</v>

1815
00:49:02.110 --> 00:49:03.130
<v Speaker 5>They don't fuck with you.</v>

1816
00:49:03.131 --> 00:49:04.870
<v Speaker 5>They don't tell you that your music sucks.</v>

1817
00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:05.610
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1818
00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:07.930
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] it's so difficult to get that though.</v>

1819
00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:09.970
<v Speaker 5>We were so many human beings.</v>

1820
00:49:09.971 --> 00:49:10.450
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

1821
00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:11.650
<v Speaker 5>when you fly over cities,</v>

1822
00:49:11.651 --> 00:49:11.881
<v Speaker 5>do you,</v>

1823
00:49:11.881 --> 00:49:16.420
<v Speaker 5>do you ever look out in amazement at what a crazy structure like Los Angeles</v>

1824
00:49:16.421 --> 00:49:16.691
<v Speaker 5>really,</v>

1825
00:49:16.691 --> 00:49:17.270
<v Speaker 5>truly is?</v>

1826
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:19.810
<v Speaker 5>You see the lights like when you flew in here just flying at night?</v>

1827
00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:20.111
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1828
00:49:20.111 --> 00:49:20.221
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1829
00:49:20.221 --> 00:49:20.410
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1830
00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:20.770
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

1831
00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:21.603
<v Speaker 5>we drove.</v>

1832
00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:22.390
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1833
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:22.721
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

1834
00:49:22.721 --> 00:49:22.870
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1835
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:24.090
<v Speaker 5>I have flown into La.</v>

1836
00:49:24.110 --> 00:49:24.730
<v Speaker 5>It's ridiculous.</v>

1837
00:49:24.730 --> 00:49:26.560
<v Speaker 5>100 million times and you're flying at night.</v>

1838
00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:28.120
<v Speaker 5>Very rarely flying at night,</v>

1839
00:49:28.121 --> 00:49:29.830
<v Speaker 5>but I did recently and flying in,</v>

1840
00:49:29.831 --> 00:49:30.371
<v Speaker 5>you see it,</v>

1841
00:49:30.371 --> 00:49:31.030
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

1842
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:33.190
<v Speaker 5>how is this not science fiction?</v>

1843
00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:36.550
<v Speaker 5>How has this not some crazy blade runner fucking movie?</v>

1844
00:49:36.551 --> 00:49:37.720
<v Speaker 5>Just the way it looks,</v>

1845
00:49:37.930 --> 00:49:38.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1846
00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:42.110
<v Speaker 5>flying into this giant grid of artificial light motherboard.</v>

1847
00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:43.203
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>

1848
00:49:43.210 --> 00:49:43.481
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1849
00:49:43.481 --> 00:49:43.641
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1850
00:49:43.641 --> 00:49:44.110
<v Speaker 5>it's uh,</v>

1851
00:49:44.110 --> 00:49:44.830
<v Speaker 5>it's so,</v>

1852
00:49:44.830 --> 00:49:45.011
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1853
00:49:45.011 --> 00:49:45.760
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

1854
00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:47.440
<v Speaker 5>it's such a thing that we take for granted.</v>

1855
00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:48.520
<v Speaker 5>You remember my friend Larry,</v>

1856
00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:51.080
<v Speaker 5>Larry had this house in the Hollywood hills and a,</v>

1857
00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:53.470
<v Speaker 5>you would look out at night and I never realized like,</v>

1858
00:49:53.471 --> 00:49:56.020
<v Speaker 5>why is it what you want to live in the Hollywood hills and fucking pollutions up</v>

1859
00:49:56.021 --> 00:49:56.291
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

1860
00:49:56.291 --> 00:49:57.124
<v Speaker 5>It's Shitty.</v>

1861
00:49:57.130 --> 00:50:02.130
<v Speaker 5>What fucking vision that view is the view of the Los Angeles skyline at night.</v>

1862
00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:06.970
<v Speaker 5>Like it doesn't look good that day and the day just looking down at like gray</v>

1863
00:50:06.971 --> 00:50:08.260
<v Speaker 5>shit pollution.</v>

1864
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:13.470
<v Speaker 5>But at nighttime you're seeing this crazy electronic tron grid.</v>

1865
00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:13.930
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1866
00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:14.420
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1867
00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:15.910
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's really amazing.</v>

1868
00:50:15.911 --> 00:50:16.121
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1869
00:50:16.121 --> 00:50:16.720
<v Speaker 5>we don't,</v>

1870
00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:19.150
<v Speaker 5>we don't see it because we're down in it and a part of it,</v>

1871
00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:21.670
<v Speaker 5>but what a bizarre thing we've created.</v>

1872
00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:22.030
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1873
00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:22.360
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1874
00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:22.870
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1875
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:24.640
<v Speaker 5>part of that is it is also,</v>

1876
00:50:24.641 --> 00:50:25.570
<v Speaker 5>it's unnatural.</v>

1877
00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:26.080
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1878
00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:26.750
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>

1879
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:28.250
<v Speaker 5>that those collections</v>

1880
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:28.641
<v Speaker 3>of lights,</v>

1881
00:50:28.641 --> 00:50:31.940
<v Speaker 3>definitely d shouldn't be here in southern California because there's no water</v>

1882
00:50:31.941 --> 00:50:32.260
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

1883
00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:32.770
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1884
00:50:32.770 --> 00:50:36.220
<v Speaker 6>we also have a theory that it's bad for our consciousness to have these things</v>

1885
00:50:36.221 --> 00:50:38.410
<v Speaker 6>at night because we not allowed to see the stars.</v>

1886
00:50:38.411 --> 00:50:40.510
<v Speaker 6>Then we're not able to see the stars.</v>

1887
00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:42.520
<v Speaker 6>I think that's not good for people.</v>

1888
00:50:42.521 --> 00:50:43.354
<v Speaker 6>I think people,</v>

1889
00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:45.790
<v Speaker 6>I think a couple stars in the sky,</v>

1890
00:50:45.970 --> 00:50:47.350
<v Speaker 6>those are two abstracts.</v>

1891
00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:48.520
<v Speaker 6>You know the moon like,</v>

1892
00:50:48.521 --> 00:50:49.390
<v Speaker 6>oh there's my friend,</v>

1893
00:50:49.391 --> 00:50:50.560
<v Speaker 6>the moon I used to him,</v>

1894
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:51.250
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

1895
00:50:51.250 --> 00:50:51.431
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

1896
00:50:51.431 --> 00:50:54.550
<v Speaker 6>the image of the starry nights in the BRASSICA.</v>

1897
00:50:54.551 --> 00:50:58.130
<v Speaker 6>When you're driving on the highway and you just pull over the car and you open</v>

1898
00:50:58.131 --> 00:50:59.140
<v Speaker 6>the door and look up and go,</v>

1899
00:50:59.141 --> 00:51:00.490
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit,</v>

1900
00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:01.390
<v Speaker 6>get out of the car,</v>

1901
00:51:01.391 --> 00:51:02.710
<v Speaker 6>get out of the car and look at this.</v>

1902
00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:07.950
<v Speaker 6>And you lie on the hood of your fucking car for hours just staring up at the</v>

1903
00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:08.770
<v Speaker 6>Goddamn Milky Way.</v>

1904
00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:10.030
<v Speaker 6>But we don't get to see that.</v>

1905
00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:12.760
<v Speaker 6>We don't get to see that because we want to keep everything lit up at night.</v>

1906
00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:13.990
<v Speaker 6>And because of that,</v>

1907
00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:14.281
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

1908
00:51:14.281 --> 00:51:14.591
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

1909
00:51:14.591 --> 00:51:16.540
<v Speaker 6>you don't get that humility,</v>

1910
00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:20.470
<v Speaker 6>that realization that you are in front of the infinite,</v>

1911
00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:24.790
<v Speaker 6>but you're experiencing and impossible vision can have incredible beauty</v>

1912
00:51:24.791 --> 00:51:25.624
<v Speaker 6>connected.</v>

1913
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:26.861
<v Speaker 6>And we've started,</v>

1914
00:51:26.861 --> 00:51:28.500
<v Speaker 6>we're feist it for streetlights,</v>

1915
00:51:28.930 --> 00:51:29.770
<v Speaker 6>for street lights.</v>

1916
00:51:29.771 --> 00:51:33.340
<v Speaker 6>We've sacrificed the most incredible thing you could ever see.</v>

1917
00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:35.020
<v Speaker 6>And very few people ever get to see it.</v>

1918
00:51:35.021 --> 00:51:36.220
<v Speaker 6>And it's right above your head.</v>

1919
00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:37.300
<v Speaker 6>You don't get to see it.</v>

1920
00:51:37.450 --> 00:51:38.080
<v Speaker 6>You just don't,</v>

1921
00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:39.700
<v Speaker 6>you don't get to see it for what it really is.</v>

1922
00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:40.491
<v Speaker 3>Story.</v>

1923
00:51:40.491 --> 00:51:41.120
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1924
00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:41.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1925
00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:43.320
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing from John Dunn,</v>

1926
00:51:43.321 --> 00:51:43.621
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

1927
00:51:43.621 --> 00:51:45.090
<v Speaker 3>it was some early Christian Mancha,</v>

1928
00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:45.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1929
00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:48.390
<v Speaker 3>a story about a guy who was riding around on,</v>

1930
00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:49.050
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

1931
00:51:49.050 --> 00:51:50.070
<v Speaker 3>on an ass all day,</v>

1932
00:51:50.071 --> 00:51:51.840
<v Speaker 3>a donkey looking for a donkey.</v>

1933
00:51:52.290 --> 00:51:52.890
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

1934
00:51:52.890 --> 00:51:54.540
<v Speaker 3>it's like I'm trying to find God,</v>

1935
00:51:54.541 --> 00:51:56.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to find God and you're swimming in it,</v>

1936
00:51:56.850 --> 00:51:58.350
<v Speaker 3>but you're just not aware of it.</v>

1937
00:51:59.050 --> 00:51:59.330
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1938
00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:00.960
<v Speaker 3>and it's that shift in consciousness.</v>

1939
00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:03.060
<v Speaker 3>We know we've got 7 billion people on the planet now,</v>

1940
00:52:03.090 --> 00:52:05.220
<v Speaker 3>so not everybody's gonna get to do this.</v>

1941
00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:08.870
<v Speaker 6>This is where stuff gets really hairy.</v>

1942
00:52:08.871 --> 00:52:09.440
<v Speaker 6>This isn't every,</v>

1943
00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:10.820
<v Speaker 6>someone says something like that.</v>

1944
00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:11.031
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1945
00:52:11.031 --> 00:52:11.950
<v Speaker 6>we're going to have to kill him,</v>

1946
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.823
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1947
00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:13.910
<v Speaker 6>and they want to die.</v>

1948
00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:14.380
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1949
00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:15.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to kill anybody,</v>

1950
00:52:15.490 --> 00:52:17.050
<v Speaker 3>but death is inevitable.</v>

1951
00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:18.023
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1952
00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:19.450
<v Speaker 3>But that's a lot.</v>

1953
00:52:19.451 --> 00:52:20.460
<v Speaker 3>That's a big number though.</v>

1954
00:52:20.461 --> 00:52:20.961
<v Speaker 3>I'm so,</v>

1955
00:52:20.961 --> 00:52:21.940
<v Speaker 3>it's so many people.</v>

1956
00:52:21.970 --> 00:52:24.330
<v Speaker 3>Do you believe in the Georgia Guidestones is you believe that she was willing to</v>

1957
00:52:24.331 --> 00:52:25.990
<v Speaker 3>be like 500 million on the whole planet?</v>

1958
00:52:26.350 --> 00:52:29.980
<v Speaker 3>I believe that there is a balance that can be achieved.</v>

1959
00:52:29.981 --> 00:52:31.780
<v Speaker 3>That's probably much greater than that.</v>

1960
00:52:31.810 --> 00:52:32.170
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

1961
00:52:32.170 --> 00:52:34.480
<v Speaker 3>if mankind were live with permaculture,</v>

1962
00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:38.980
<v Speaker 3>we need more than $500 million to fight off the animals.</v>

1963
00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:40.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we're going to get to choose what the number's gonna.</v>

1964
00:52:40.850 --> 00:52:41.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1965
00:52:41.170 --> 00:52:43.480
<v Speaker 6>I think the way we are right now with the animals,</v>

1966
00:52:43.481 --> 00:52:45.490
<v Speaker 6>and it's very rare that an animal attacks you.</v>

1967
00:52:45.491 --> 00:52:47.110
<v Speaker 6>I think this is the perfect place to be.</v>

1968
00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:49.370
<v Speaker 6>They can suck my deck.</v>

1969
00:52:49.371 --> 00:52:49.571
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>

1970
00:52:49.571 --> 00:52:50.231
<v Speaker 6>They're all animals.</v>

1971
00:52:50.231 --> 00:52:51.160
<v Speaker 6>I'm on team people.</v>

1972
00:52:51.161 --> 00:52:54.580
<v Speaker 6>If we're just out there dominated to the point where we don't have to worry</v>

1973
00:52:54.581 --> 00:52:55.810
<v Speaker 6>about them eating our children,</v>

1974
00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:56.950
<v Speaker 6>you know right there.</v>

1975
00:52:56.951 --> 00:52:59.800
<v Speaker 6>I think that's good because this is a rare point in history.</v>

1976
00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:02.290
<v Speaker 6>People have sort of forgotten that at one point in time,</v>

1977
00:53:02.291 --> 00:53:03.700
<v Speaker 6>just 50,000 years ago,</v>

1978
00:53:03.701 --> 00:53:04.600
<v Speaker 6>fucking blink of the eye.</v>

1979
00:53:04.601 --> 00:53:05.411
<v Speaker 6>Everywhere you went,</v>

1980
00:53:05.411 --> 00:53:06.250
<v Speaker 6>you could have gotten eaten.</v>

1981
00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:07.031
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1982
00:53:07.031 --> 00:53:07.864
<v Speaker 6>everywhere you went,</v>

1983
00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:09.910
<v Speaker 6>you just animal wild animals everywhere.</v>

1984
00:53:09.970 --> 00:53:12.040
<v Speaker 6>50,000 years ago there was fucking saber tooth.</v>

1985
00:53:12.041 --> 00:53:12.874
<v Speaker 6>Tigers are still there,</v>

1986
00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:14.210
<v Speaker 3>but there's,</v>

1987
00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:17.590
<v Speaker 3>there was always a balanced humans rose to a population of,</v>

1988
00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:19.870
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1989
00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:23.320
<v Speaker 3>two or 3 million stayed there for a long estimated 5 million.</v>

1990
00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:26.010
<v Speaker 3>But it was stable more than,</v>

1991
00:53:26.011 --> 00:53:26.251
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1992
00:53:26.251 --> 00:53:28.800
<v Speaker 3>more than a thousand years at like a billion people on the planet.</v>

1993
00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:29.370
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1994
00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:29.790
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

1995
00:53:29.790 --> 00:53:30.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1996
00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:31.290
<v Speaker 3>but even this,</v>

1997
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:33.510
<v Speaker 3>we were still overusing resources.</v>

1998
00:53:33.511 --> 00:53:36.300
<v Speaker 3>We were still chopping down all the forests in Europe because all of the sea,</v>

1999
00:53:36.301 --> 00:53:36.750
<v Speaker 3>all of these,</v>

2000
00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:39.960
<v Speaker 3>all the colonial expansion was to find more resources to consume.</v>

2001
00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:42.120
<v Speaker 3>We've reached the end of the planet,</v>

2002
00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:42.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2003
00:53:42.481 --> 00:53:45.000
<v Speaker 3>there's no more places to go discover to get more stuff.</v>

2004
00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:47.280
<v Speaker 1>So how do you stop people from breeding?</v>

2005
00:53:47.470 --> 00:53:48.930
<v Speaker 1>Because kids are awesome.</v>

2006
00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:50.730
<v Speaker 1>I love having kids.</v>

2007
00:53:50.731 --> 00:53:52.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of my favorite things in life.</v>

2008
00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:54.150
<v Speaker 1>Is that the part of the problem?</v>

2009
00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:55.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean it can't be,</v>

2010
00:53:55.621 --> 00:53:57.210
<v Speaker 1>it can't be a one or two people.</v>

2011
00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:01.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean that you make the real problem is a lack of resources.</v>

2012
00:54:01.651 --> 00:54:02.484
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2013
00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:03.353
<v Speaker 1>The real problem.</v>

2014
00:54:03.450 --> 00:54:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it possible that there could be some sort of a scientific discovery,</v>

2015
00:54:07.530 --> 00:54:08.580
<v Speaker 1>some something,</v>

2016
00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:11.910
<v Speaker 1>something that changes the game as far as the way we can,</v>

2017
00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:12.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2018
00:54:12.511 --> 00:54:16.290
<v Speaker 1>we can harness energy that could possibly pull us in a,</v>

2019
00:54:16.291 --> 00:54:19.200
<v Speaker 1>in a more positive direction than a complete and total collapse.</v>

2020
00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:19.501
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2021
00:54:19.501 --> 00:54:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Like some sort of a skin.</v>

2022
00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:21.421
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2023
00:54:21.421 --> 00:54:21.930
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

2024
00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:22.763
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible</v>

2025
00:54:23.090 --> 00:54:23.450
<v Speaker 3>Dan.</v>

2026
00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:24.283
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2027
00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:25.490
<v Speaker 3>we're fucked.</v>

2028
00:54:25.550 --> 00:54:25.910
<v Speaker 3>Period.</v>

2029
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:26.743
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2030
00:54:26.770 --> 00:54:27.860
<v Speaker 3>there they are now.</v>

2031
00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:28.400
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2032
00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:30.080
<v Speaker 3>you should have a tee shirt and sell it on your website though,</v>

2033
00:54:30.081 --> 00:54:30.700
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>

2034
00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:31.380
<v Speaker 3>Since we're far.</v>

2035
00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:32.570
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah,</v>

2036
00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:33.733
<v Speaker 3>that would be great.</v>

2037
00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:35.690
<v Speaker 3>I have to think about what to put on the backside.</v>

2038
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:38.350
<v Speaker 3>There are upsides.</v>

2039
00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:42.710
<v Speaker 3>1 billion internal combustion powered vehicles on the planet today.</v>

2040
00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:43.490
<v Speaker 3>1 billion.</v>

2041
00:54:43.490 --> 00:54:44.323
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

2042
00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:45.860
<v Speaker 3>They all run on oil.</v>

2043
00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:46.813
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2044
00:54:46.850 --> 00:54:51.850
<v Speaker 3>And it took untold tens of thousands of gallons of oil to make the vehicle.</v>

2045
00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:54.090
<v Speaker 3>You got to mind your,</v>

2046
00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:54.891
<v Speaker 3>you got to melt it.</v>

2047
00:54:54.891 --> 00:54:56.510
<v Speaker 3>You got a formula that paints oil,</v>

2048
00:54:56.780 --> 00:54:58.160
<v Speaker 3>plastic is oil,</v>

2049
00:54:58.270 --> 00:54:58.471
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

2050
00:54:58.471 --> 00:54:58.611
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

2051
00:54:58.611 --> 00:54:58.761
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

2052
00:54:58.761 --> 00:54:59.120
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

2053
00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:00.650
<v Speaker 3>So it took all the oil to make that.</v>

2054
00:55:00.651 --> 00:55:02.600
<v Speaker 3>So even if some new technology appeared today,</v>

2055
00:55:02.601 --> 00:55:05.900
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't plug it into any internal combustion powered vehicle and make it</v>

2056
00:55:05.901 --> 00:55:06.734
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

2057
00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:08.540
<v Speaker 3>There's seven gallons of oil and every tire.</v>

2058
00:55:08.810 --> 00:55:08.961
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2059
00:55:08.961 --> 00:55:09.351
<v Speaker 3>How much,</v>

2060
00:55:09.351 --> 00:55:11.750
<v Speaker 3>how many gallons of oil are there an electric cars?</v>

2061
00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:13.580
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2062
00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:16.100
<v Speaker 3>it depends on how big the car is.</v>

2063
00:55:16.101 --> 00:55:16.431
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2064
00:55:16.431 --> 00:55:16.641
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2065
00:55:16.641 --> 00:55:16.970
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2066
00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:17.570
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2067
00:55:17.570 --> 00:55:17.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2068
00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:18.800
<v Speaker 3>must be a lot though,</v>

2069
00:55:18.801 --> 00:55:18.951
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2070
00:55:18.951 --> 00:55:19.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2071
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:20.023
<v Speaker 3>I mean</v>

2072
00:55:20.290 --> 00:55:23.140
<v Speaker 1>is it's impossible to make a car without using oil.</v>

2073
00:55:23.590 --> 00:55:24.423
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2074
00:55:24.610 --> 00:55:25.443
<v Speaker 1>Impossible.</v>

2075
00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:26.590
<v Speaker 1>And even an electric car,</v>

2076
00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:28.511
<v Speaker 1>an electric car,</v>

2077
00:55:28.511 --> 00:55:30.880
<v Speaker 1>all you also have to worry about conflict minerals that are powering your</v>

2078
00:55:30.881 --> 00:55:31.714
<v Speaker 1>batteries.</v>

2079
00:55:32.070 --> 00:55:34.020
<v Speaker 3>Electricity is not an energy source.</v>

2080
00:55:34.021 --> 00:55:35.670
<v Speaker 3>Electricity has to be generated.</v>

2081
00:55:35.671 --> 00:55:36.510
<v Speaker 3>How do you generate it?</v>

2082
00:55:36.511 --> 00:55:37.231
<v Speaker 3>By burning oil,</v>

2083
00:55:37.231 --> 00:55:38.100
<v Speaker 3>by burning coal,</v>

2084
00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:42.150
<v Speaker 3>by burning natural gas or a nuclear reactor.</v>

2085
00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:43.410
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

2086
00:55:43.710 --> 00:55:43.951
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2087
00:55:43.951 --> 00:55:45.960
<v Speaker 3>so electricity is no ads.</v>

2088
00:55:45.961 --> 00:55:49.830
<v Speaker 3>It still has to be generated and most of our electricity in the U S is natural</v>

2089
00:55:49.831 --> 00:55:53.820
<v Speaker 3>gas and coal dictated to electricity and once we got addicted to electricity and</v>

2090
00:55:53.821 --> 00:55:55.020
<v Speaker 3>then we multiplied like rats,</v>

2091
00:55:55.021 --> 00:55:57.750
<v Speaker 3>electricity is the lifeblood of human industrial civilization.</v>

2092
00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:59.580
<v Speaker 3>The refrigerator on it keeps the TV running.</v>

2093
00:55:59.581 --> 00:56:00.990
<v Speaker 3>It keeps credit card circulating.</v>

2094
00:56:00.991 --> 00:56:02.400
<v Speaker 3>It keeps you charged.</v>

2095
00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:04.290
<v Speaker 3>No electricity,</v>

2096
00:56:04.291 --> 00:56:04.920
<v Speaker 3>no economy.</v>

2097
00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:05.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2098
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:06.120
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

2099
00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:06.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2100
00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:07.201
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing.</v>

2101
00:56:07.201 --> 00:56:07.450
<v Speaker 3>What a,</v>

2102
00:56:07.450 --> 00:56:08.160
<v Speaker 3>what a mess.</v>

2103
00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:12.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean it had that big blackout down down here down to San Diego and Whoa,</v>

2104
00:56:12.481 --> 00:56:12.810
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

2105
00:56:12.810 --> 00:56:15.600
<v Speaker 3>That was a bucket of cold water in the face because that was real panic.</v>

2106
00:56:15.601 --> 00:56:16.830
<v Speaker 3>That was a multistate.</v>

2107
00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:18.840
<v Speaker 3>Those are going to do in the summer,</v>

2108
00:56:18.841 --> 00:56:19.170
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2109
00:56:19.170 --> 00:56:19.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2110
00:56:19.530 --> 00:56:22.410
<v Speaker 3>Those are going to be coming and eventually they're going to be permanent.</v>

2111
00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:25.330
<v Speaker 3>The power won't be coming back on again.</v>

2112
00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:27.280
<v Speaker 3>Isn't there a way to keep the power on,</v>

2113
00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:30.130
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2114
00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:30.520
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>

2115
00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:32.040
<v Speaker 3>I like refrigerated food.</v>

2116
00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:33.490
<v Speaker 3>I like TV.</v>

2117
00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:38.760
<v Speaker 3>Has gotta be a way out of that now help us help those that want to be helped and</v>

2118
00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:40.271
<v Speaker 3>in the movie,</v>

2119
00:56:40.271 --> 00:56:41.380
<v Speaker 3>I'll have to live in the woods.</v>

2120
00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:42.100
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2121
00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:42.400
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2122
00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:43.233
<v Speaker 3>Well good.</v>

2123
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:45.400
<v Speaker 3>Stay out of the woods.</v>

2124
00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:47.561
<v Speaker 3>In the movie,</v>

2125
00:56:47.561 --> 00:56:50.890
<v Speaker 3>I told the story about campers being attacked by a bear.</v>

2126
00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:51.580
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2127
00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:52.000
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2128
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:52.420
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

2129
00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:52.800
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

2130
00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:56.140
<v Speaker 3>if you're in a camp and a big bear attacks to camp,</v>

2131
00:56:56.141 --> 00:56:58.330
<v Speaker 3>you do not have to be faster than the bear.</v>

2132
00:56:58.630 --> 00:57:02.770
<v Speaker 3>You only have to be faster than the slowest camper period.</v>

2133
00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:06.460
<v Speaker 3>That's the lesson for everybody here who becomes aware of collapse.</v>

2134
00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:07.630
<v Speaker 3>The slow campers,</v>

2135
00:57:07.631 --> 00:57:08.231
<v Speaker 3>the zombies,</v>

2136
00:57:08.231 --> 00:57:08.921
<v Speaker 3>as we call them,</v>

2137
00:57:08.921 --> 00:57:11.170
<v Speaker 3>are going to be out there zombies until the last minute.</v>

2138
00:57:11.470 --> 00:57:12.221
<v Speaker 3>You know when,</v>

2139
00:57:12.221 --> 00:57:14.950
<v Speaker 3>when nothing is working anymore and people are starving to death and they're</v>

2140
00:57:14.951 --> 00:57:15.784
<v Speaker 3>going to go and say,</v>

2141
00:57:15.790 --> 00:57:15.971
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2142
00:57:15.971 --> 00:57:16.241
<v Speaker 3>Gee,</v>

2143
00:57:16.241 --> 00:57:17.021
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand.</v>

2144
00:57:17.021 --> 00:57:18.370
<v Speaker 3>This is going to come back any second.</v>

2145
00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:20.170
<v Speaker 3>The faster campers,</v>

2146
00:57:20.171 --> 00:57:22.660
<v Speaker 3>the ones worthy of Darwinian selection.</v>

2147
00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:24.190
<v Speaker 3>Ha.</v>

2148
00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:28.930
<v Speaker 3>There are tens of millions of us around the world already moving local food</v>

2149
00:57:28.931 --> 00:57:31.720
<v Speaker 3>production first and foremost,</v>

2150
00:57:31.721 --> 00:57:35.770
<v Speaker 3>start growing food wherever you are right now and at and then building</v>

2151
00:57:35.771 --> 00:57:38.800
<v Speaker 3>communities and disengaging from that paradigm.</v>

2152
00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:41.020
<v Speaker 3>So those are the people who are going to make it,</v>

2153
00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:42.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2154
00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:42.881
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2155
00:57:42.881 --> 00:57:43.750
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2156
00:57:43.751 --> 00:57:45.820
<v Speaker 3>and some areas in some regions won't.</v>

2157
00:57:45.821 --> 00:57:46.151
<v Speaker 3>But let's see,</v>

2158
00:57:46.151 --> 00:57:48.880
<v Speaker 3>I get to see this all over the world as a result of collapse.</v>

2159
00:57:48.881 --> 00:57:51.940
<v Speaker 3>I got do you have to be somewhere where you're not going to need a car?</v>

2160
00:57:53.410 --> 00:57:54.670
<v Speaker 3>Does that an issue?</v>

2161
00:57:54.671 --> 00:57:56.230
<v Speaker 3>And eventually we're going to run an oil,</v>

2162
00:57:56.830 --> 00:57:57.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2163
00:57:57.220 --> 00:57:57.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2164
00:57:57.680 --> 00:57:58.513
<v Speaker 3>Close.</v>

2165
00:57:59.140 --> 00:57:59.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2166
00:57:59.800 --> 00:57:59.981
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2167
00:57:59.981 --> 00:58:01.240
<v Speaker 3>there'll always be oil in the ground.</v>

2168
00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:01.781
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2169
00:58:01.781 --> 00:58:02.261
<v Speaker 3>gasoline.</v>

2170
00:58:02.261 --> 00:58:02.500
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2171
00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:03.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean like when you think,</v>

2172
00:58:03.550 --> 00:58:05.980
<v Speaker 3>when do you think it will be an issue where you won't be able to get gas?</v>

2173
00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:06.431
<v Speaker 3>Is that,</v>

2174
00:58:06.431 --> 00:58:07.480
<v Speaker 3>is that something you foresee?</v>

2175
00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:09.130
<v Speaker 3>It's an issue in this country right now.</v>

2176
00:58:09.131 --> 00:58:10.690
<v Speaker 3>We've had massive fuel shortages,</v>

2177
00:58:10.691 --> 00:58:12.640
<v Speaker 3>diesel shortages that have paralyzed us.</v>

2178
00:58:12.641 --> 00:58:14.950
<v Speaker 3>He's on the upper Midwest.</v>

2179
00:58:14.951 --> 00:58:15.784
<v Speaker 3>Canada.</v>

2180
00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:16.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2181
00:58:16.690 --> 00:58:18.640
<v Speaker 3>And it's happening all over the world right now.</v>

2182
00:58:18.641 --> 00:58:19.181
<v Speaker 3>You don't see it.</v>

2183
00:58:19.181 --> 00:58:19.481
<v Speaker 3>We have,</v>

2184
00:58:19.481 --> 00:58:21.190
<v Speaker 3>we're bringing out the stories on collapse net,</v>

2185
00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:22.181
<v Speaker 3>Johannesburg,</v>

2186
00:58:22.181 --> 00:58:22.901
<v Speaker 3>South Africa,</v>

2187
00:58:22.901 --> 00:58:24.030
<v Speaker 3>gas station shutdown,</v>

2188
00:58:24.130 --> 00:58:24.491
<v Speaker 3>India,</v>

2189
00:58:24.491 --> 00:58:27.610
<v Speaker 3>Pakistan falling apart because they can't get the oil.</v>

2190
00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:28.240
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2191
00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:29.440
<v Speaker 3>so that's a problem.</v>

2192
00:58:29.441 --> 00:58:30.730
<v Speaker 3>It's going to get worse and worse and worse.</v>

2193
00:58:30.731 --> 00:58:31.900
<v Speaker 3>It won't be like turning a switch.</v>

2194
00:58:31.901 --> 00:58:33.940
<v Speaker 3>You have oil one day and your gas one day,</v>

2195
00:58:33.941 --> 00:58:34.240
<v Speaker 3>Dan,</v>

2196
00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:34.691
<v Speaker 3>no gas.</v>

2197
00:58:34.691 --> 00:58:36.640
<v Speaker 3>The next day it becomes harder to get,</v>

2198
00:58:36.641 --> 00:58:37.061
<v Speaker 3>et Cetera,</v>

2199
00:58:37.061 --> 00:58:37.420
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>

2200
00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:40.870
<v Speaker 3>Why is gas cheaper though right now than it was like say three years ago?</v>

2201
00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:45.760
<v Speaker 3>That's a result also of the fact that the economy is much slower.</v>

2202
00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:50.740
<v Speaker 3>It's 96% correlation between greenhouse gas emission and GDP growth.</v>

2203
00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:55.330
<v Speaker 3>You don't grow the economy without burning oil and natural gas.</v>

2204
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.650
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2205
00:58:56.650 --> 00:58:57.400
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2206
00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:58.930
<v Speaker 3>so there's less demand now.</v>

2207
00:58:58.960 --> 00:58:59.390
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2208
00:58:59.390 --> 00:59:00.230
<v Speaker 6>but when,</v>

2209
00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:01.910
<v Speaker 6>when Bush was leaving office though,</v>

2210
00:59:01.911 --> 00:59:04.430
<v Speaker 6>how'd they get away with jacking the gas through the fucking roof?</v>

2211
00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:06.140
<v Speaker 6>Because it was almost like it was,</v>

2212
00:59:06.141 --> 00:59:08.520
<v Speaker 6>I almost heard like the rolling stones plane,</v>

2213
00:59:08.590 --> 00:59:08.951
<v Speaker 6>who,</v>

2214
00:59:08.951 --> 00:59:11.270
<v Speaker 6>who like playing in the back or why they were doing it.</v>

2215
00:59:11.450 --> 00:59:12.560
<v Speaker 6>It seemed like,</v>

2216
00:59:12.590 --> 00:59:12.921
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2217
00:59:12.921 --> 00:59:13.131
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2218
00:59:13.131 --> 00:59:13.421
<v Speaker 6>they were,</v>

2219
00:59:13.421 --> 00:59:14.990
<v Speaker 6>they were going out in a blaze of glory.</v>

2220
00:59:15.010 --> 00:59:17.300
<v Speaker 6>He's the chief Francis Ford Coppola movie.</v>

2221
00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:18.131
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

2222
00:59:18.131 --> 00:59:18.964
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2223
00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:19.881
<v Speaker 6>at the end of it,</v>

2224
00:59:19.881 --> 00:59:23.120
<v Speaker 6>it was like they jacked it up to $5 a gallon and everybody's like,</v>

2225
00:59:23.121 --> 00:59:24.110
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck?</v>

2226
00:59:24.111 --> 00:59:24.560
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2227
00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:25.130
<v Speaker 6>people were like,</v>

2228
00:59:25.130 --> 00:59:26.840
<v Speaker 6>couldn't drive themselves to work.</v>

2229
00:59:26.841 --> 00:59:28.040
<v Speaker 6>You get to be a real panic.</v>

2230
00:59:28.090 --> 00:59:29.480
<v Speaker 3>That was a direct product there,</v>

2231
00:59:29.481 --> 00:59:31.300
<v Speaker 3>but I mean it wasn't George Bush,</v>

2232
00:59:31.301 --> 00:59:35.020
<v Speaker 3>Dick Cheney or a Hank Paulson or somebody like that flipping a switch saying,</v>

2233
00:59:35.021 --> 00:59:35.231
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2234
00:59:35.231 --> 00:59:36.730
<v Speaker 3>we're going to put gas at five bucks.</v>

2235
00:59:36.731 --> 00:59:37.564
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2236
00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:39.520
<v Speaker 3>it was a super heated economy.</v>

2237
00:59:39.521 --> 00:59:44.521
<v Speaker 3>We were growing then at the end of 2007 we were at and so the faster you grow,</v>

2238
00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:47.680
<v Speaker 3>the more energy you consume again,</v>

2239
00:59:48.250 --> 00:59:52.930
<v Speaker 3>but you reach a point as a result of peak oil where you need more cheap oil than</v>

2240
00:59:52.931 --> 00:59:53.764
<v Speaker 3>you can find.</v>

2241
00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:55.600
<v Speaker 3>You've eaten all the low hanging fruit,</v>

2242
00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:56.860
<v Speaker 3>you found all the chief oil.</v>

2243
00:59:56.890 --> 00:59:58.240
<v Speaker 3>It's not inexhaustible.</v>

2244
00:59:58.270 --> 01:00:01.660
<v Speaker 3>Deep water horizons a result of us being desperate to go out and get oil.</v>

2245
01:00:01.661 --> 01:00:03.190
<v Speaker 3>It's more and more expensive to get.</v>

2246
01:00:03.790 --> 01:00:08.790
<v Speaker 3>So the economy got so hot that the oil prices spike because that was what demand</v>

2247
01:00:09.370 --> 01:00:10.360
<v Speaker 3>was doing at the time.</v>

2248
01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:11.650
<v Speaker 3>There was some minor stuff,</v>

2249
01:00:11.651 --> 01:00:12.040
<v Speaker 3>what Spec,</v>

2250
01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:15.790
<v Speaker 3>but it's fundamentally peak oil and one 47 a barrel oils.</v>

2251
01:00:15.791 --> 01:00:16.390
<v Speaker 3>What shut,</v>

2252
01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:19.180
<v Speaker 3>shut us down in 2008 and we're,</v>

2253
01:00:19.181 --> 01:00:22.240
<v Speaker 3>we're just about to hit another place right now with oil at a hundred,</v>

2254
01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:25.750
<v Speaker 3>hundred and five that's going to shut everything down because people are so much</v>

2255
01:00:25.751 --> 01:00:27.610
<v Speaker 3>more broke than they were in 2008.</v>

2256
01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:28.331
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2257
01:00:28.331 --> 01:00:31.390
<v Speaker 3>and we're looking at a possible attack on Iran.</v>

2258
01:00:31.391 --> 01:00:32.740
<v Speaker 3>We're looking at Saudi Arabia,</v>

2259
01:00:32.741 --> 01:00:35.080
<v Speaker 3>possibly collapsing a racks now in civil war.</v>

2260
01:00:35.110 --> 01:00:37.030
<v Speaker 3>Just a week after we pulled our troops out.</v>

2261
01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:38.011
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that insane?</v>

2262
01:00:38.011 --> 01:00:38.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2263
01:00:38.770 --> 01:00:39.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2264
01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:39.671
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2265
01:00:39.671 --> 01:00:41.740
<v Speaker 3>do you s is getting bitch slapped around the world right now?</v>

2266
01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:44.220
<v Speaker 6>The a thing is insane.</v>

2267
01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:44.881
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2268
01:00:44.881 --> 01:00:45.011
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

2269
01:00:45.011 --> 01:00:45.360
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

2270
01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:45.720
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

2271
01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:46.710
<v Speaker 6>they took a day,</v>

2272
01:00:46.830 --> 01:00:47.663
<v Speaker 6>they fell apart</v>

2273
01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:48.643
<v Speaker 3>immediately.</v>

2274
01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:50.180
<v Speaker 3>Like from the get go.</v>

2275
01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:54.920
<v Speaker 3>Actually on the same day that the last the US troops left Iraq,</v>

2276
01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:55.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2277
01:00:55.650 --> 01:00:56.820
<v Speaker 3>nor ya'll Maliki had a,</v>

2278
01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:57.390
<v Speaker 3>had a,</v>

2279
01:00:57.390 --> 01:00:57.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2280
01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:02.800
<v Speaker 3>delegation fly to Syria to Damascus to meet with a resident Al Assad,</v>

2281
01:01:03.081 --> 01:01:06.320
<v Speaker 3>because the US is trying to overthrow Assad cause he's an ally of Iran.</v>

2282
01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:07.663
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2283
01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:08.533
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2284
01:01:08.570 --> 01:01:11.990
<v Speaker 3>I'll moloka who was a Shiite was starting to side with Syria.</v>

2285
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:16.970
<v Speaker 3>So the u s and Israel had been very intent on attacking Iran,</v>

2286
01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:18.940
<v Speaker 3>which is a stupid suicidal move.</v>

2287
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:19.221
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2288
01:01:19.221 --> 01:01:19.371
<v Speaker 3>it'll,</v>

2289
01:01:19.371 --> 01:01:22.310
<v Speaker 3>it'll kill all of us because the world can't do without oil.</v>

2290
01:01:22.790 --> 01:01:24.410
<v Speaker 3>And that'll shut down in the Gulf in China.</v>

2291
01:01:24.411 --> 01:01:24.830
<v Speaker 3>We'll bag.</v>

2292
01:01:24.830 --> 01:01:25.663
<v Speaker 3>It's ugly.</v>

2293
01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:28.240
<v Speaker 6>So what's the motivation for this?</v>

2294
01:01:28.270 --> 01:01:31.420
<v Speaker 6>What's the motivation to invade Iran oil?</v>

2295
01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:32.920
<v Speaker 6>To control the oil</v>

2296
01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:33.930
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2297
01:01:33.930 --> 01:01:36.590
<v Speaker 3>and because Iran is truly a regional power,</v>

2298
01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:37.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2299
01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:40.850
<v Speaker 3>that can threaten us western control of the region.</v>

2300
01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:44.060
<v Speaker 3>But what's happening now as the Western economies fail,</v>

2301
01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:44.480
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2302
01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:45.370
<v Speaker 3>Europe is toast and,</v>

2303
01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:45.661
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2304
01:01:45.661 --> 01:01:46.011
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2305
01:01:46.011 --> 01:01:46.880
<v Speaker 3>and our,</v>

2306
01:01:46.881 --> 01:01:49.520
<v Speaker 3>our economy is in the shitter and getting much worse all the time.</v>

2307
01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:53.330
<v Speaker 3>China and a w has been growing faster,</v>

2308
01:01:53.331 --> 01:01:55.280
<v Speaker 3>but China's now starting to fall apart.</v>

2309
01:01:55.281 --> 01:01:56.240
<v Speaker 3>But China is,</v>

2310
01:01:56.270 --> 01:01:56.571
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

2311
01:01:56.571 --> 01:01:57.390
<v Speaker 3>is more of a,</v>

2312
01:01:57.390 --> 01:01:57.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2313
01:01:57.530 --> 01:01:59.570
<v Speaker 3>an economic powerhouse than we are now.</v>

2314
01:01:59.571 --> 01:02:03.140
<v Speaker 3>So the people that have the oil will go to those who can pay more for it.</v>

2315
01:02:03.590 --> 01:02:04.423
<v Speaker 3>China,</v>

2316
01:02:05.890 --> 01:02:06.131
<v Speaker 6>see,</v>

2317
01:02:06.131 --> 01:02:07.720
<v Speaker 6>when I look at us invading Iran,</v>

2318
01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:11.410
<v Speaker 6>it w w what freaks me out is it,</v>

2319
01:02:11.411 --> 01:02:13.030
<v Speaker 6>that seems like that's a real country.</v>

2320
01:02:13.150 --> 01:02:14.890
<v Speaker 6>Not that Iraq isn't a real country,</v>

2321
01:02:14.891 --> 01:02:16.180
<v Speaker 6>but it was run by a dictator.</v>

2322
01:02:16.181 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 6>It was run by a guy who was in arguably completely up and we put them</v>

2323
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:20.551
<v Speaker 1>in power.</v>

2324
01:02:20.551 --> 01:02:21.540
<v Speaker 1>He was an evil man.</v>

2325
01:02:21.541 --> 01:02:22.590
<v Speaker 1>He had evil children.</v>

2326
01:02:22.591 --> 01:02:23.060
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

2327
01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:24.030
<v Speaker 1>it was a fucking mass.</v>

2328
01:02:24.330 --> 01:02:25.020
<v Speaker 1>And then you,</v>

2329
01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:25.261
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2330
01:02:25.261 --> 01:02:26.280
<v Speaker 1>we're in Afghanistan.</v>

2331
01:02:26.281 --> 01:02:26.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2332
01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:28.650
<v Speaker 1>sort of a crazy situation in Afghanistan,</v>

2333
01:02:28.651 --> 01:02:31.590
<v Speaker 1>but there's a bunch of warlords running the country and there's really only one</v>

2334
01:02:31.591 --> 01:02:32.310
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>

2335
01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:33.091
<v Speaker 1>It's cobble.</v>

2336
01:02:33.091 --> 01:02:35.370
<v Speaker 1>And it's a really unusual place.</v>

2337
01:02:35.371 --> 01:02:35.671
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2338
01:02:35.671 --> 01:02:36.120
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2339
01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:38.010
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like there is no government anywhere</v>

2340
01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:41.680
<v Speaker 3>and 80 80 or 90% of the world's opium.</v>

2341
01:02:42.070 --> 01:02:44.940
<v Speaker 3>And then all of a sudden you talk about Iran,</v>

2342
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:45.250
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

2343
01:02:45.250 --> 01:02:45.521
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2344
01:02:45.521 --> 01:02:46.660
<v Speaker 3>I ran as a real country.</v>

2345
01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:47.111
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2346
01:02:47.111 --> 01:02:47.761
<v Speaker 3>now you're,</v>

2347
01:02:47.761 --> 01:02:49.400
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with a spirit of power.</v>

2348
01:02:49.550 --> 01:02:50.381
<v Speaker 3>You hit it right on the head.</v>

2349
01:02:50.381 --> 01:02:50.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2350
01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:51.231
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>

2351
01:02:51.231 --> 01:02:53.480
<v Speaker 1>this is like we've stepped out of the,</v>

2352
01:02:53.481 --> 01:02:53.781
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2353
01:02:53.781 --> 01:02:54.980
<v Speaker 1>we're just going after,</v>

2354
01:02:54.981 --> 01:02:55.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2355
01:02:55.340 --> 01:03:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Banana Republic fucked up countries that are run by crazy dudes and uh,</v>

2356
01:03:00.081 --> 01:03:00.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2357
01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:01.370
<v Speaker 1>who have no power,</v>

2358
01:03:01.371 --> 01:03:05.270
<v Speaker 1>who are obviously humiliated by us just a decade earlier.</v>

2359
01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:07.570
<v Speaker 3>You want to know the biggest difference between Iran and Iraq.</v>

2360
01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:11.130
<v Speaker 3>Iran has had those same borders since the time of,</v>

2361
01:03:11.131 --> 01:03:11.650
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

2362
01:03:11.650 --> 01:03:12.520
<v Speaker 3>of Xerxes.</v>

2363
01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:15.040
<v Speaker 3>2000 years BC.</v>

2364
01:03:15.070 --> 01:03:15.903
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2365
01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:17.680
<v Speaker 3>That's been around its borders.</v>

2366
01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:22.270
<v Speaker 3>The borders of Iraq were drawn by Winston Churchill with a pen or a pencil in</v>

2367
01:03:22.271 --> 01:03:26.620
<v Speaker 3>1921 after the end of World War One and Iraq was,</v>

2368
01:03:26.650 --> 01:03:29.350
<v Speaker 3>was Iran is all Shia Muslim.</v>

2369
01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:31.060
<v Speaker 3>It's all homogeneous people.</v>

2370
01:03:31.450 --> 01:03:32.950
<v Speaker 3>Iraq is Sony's,</v>

2371
01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:34.510
<v Speaker 3>she is Kurds.</v>

2372
01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:35.260
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2373
01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:35.591
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2374
01:03:35.591 --> 01:03:40.591
<v Speaker 3>they've got some Hashimite d and so Iraq really shouldn't be a country.</v>

2375
01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:42.640
<v Speaker 3>Nature wouldn't have made it a country.</v>

2376
01:03:42.641 --> 01:03:44.080
<v Speaker 3>It was politically drawn that way.</v>

2377
01:03:44.081 --> 01:03:47.050
<v Speaker 3>And that's a big weakness for a rock and a big strength for Iran.</v>

2378
01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:49.310
<v Speaker 3>And I think people sort of felt</v>

2379
01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:50.690
<v Speaker 1>something in,</v>

2380
01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:51.750
<v Speaker 1>in that way.</v>

2381
01:03:51.751 --> 01:03:53.410
<v Speaker 1>Like when we entered our rockets,</v>

2382
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:53.581
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2383
01:03:53.581 --> 01:03:53.851
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2384
01:03:53.851 --> 01:03:54.630
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2385
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:56.610
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucked up place already.</v>

2386
01:03:56.611 --> 01:03:58.590
<v Speaker 1>It's really a good idea to get rid of this guy.</v>

2387
01:03:58.591 --> 01:04:00.450
<v Speaker 1>No matter what you think about going Iraq.</v>

2388
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:02.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like we know that this guy is crazy.</v>

2389
01:04:02.431 --> 01:04:04.680
<v Speaker 1>We know that if he really does have a nuclear power,</v>

2390
01:04:04.681 --> 01:04:05.550
<v Speaker 1>we are fucked.</v>

2391
01:04:06.750 --> 01:04:07.710
<v Speaker 3>And of course,</v>

2392
01:04:07.711 --> 01:04:11.940
<v Speaker 3>Saddam Hussein had absolutely nothing to do with nine 11 he had no weapons of</v>

2393
01:04:11.941 --> 01:04:12.810
<v Speaker 3>mass destruction.</v>

2394
01:04:13.170 --> 01:04:14.610
<v Speaker 3>He had no chemical agents.</v>

2395
01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:18.990
<v Speaker 3>And yet that's the same shit bloody Barack Obama's trying to stuff down our</v>

2396
01:04:18.991 --> 01:04:20.790
<v Speaker 3>throats right now with Emeran.</v>

2397
01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:21.773
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2398
01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:25.530
<v Speaker 3>And that's the button that Ron Paul hits and that's the bullshit button.</v>

2399
01:04:25.770 --> 01:04:27.480
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend Dmitri Orloff,</v>

2400
01:04:27.481 --> 01:04:28.201
<v Speaker 3>he's Russian.</v>

2401
01:04:28.201 --> 01:04:29.940
<v Speaker 3>He survived the collapsed and he's a writer.</v>

2402
01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:30.570
<v Speaker 3>Brilliant guy,</v>

2403
01:04:30.570 --> 01:04:31.201
<v Speaker 3>good friend.</v>

2404
01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:32.610
<v Speaker 3>He calls it the Aha moment.</v>

2405
01:04:33.210 --> 01:04:36.180
<v Speaker 3>It's the moment when in in the old Soviet Union went,</v>

2406
01:04:36.181 --> 01:04:37.014
<v Speaker 3>everybody went,</v>

2407
01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.273
<v Speaker 3>Aha,</v>

2408
01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:39.660
<v Speaker 3>it's collapsed.</v>

2409
01:04:40.830 --> 01:04:41.641
<v Speaker 3>It's not working.</v>

2410
01:04:41.641 --> 01:04:42.450
<v Speaker 3>It's not credible.</v>

2411
01:04:42.450 --> 01:04:43.560
<v Speaker 3>Nobody believes it.</v>

2412
01:04:43.561 --> 01:04:45.960
<v Speaker 3>And Ron Paul is bringing that Aha moment,</v>

2413
01:04:46.590 --> 01:04:46.801
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2414
01:04:46.801 --> 01:04:48.120
<v Speaker 3>like the emperor's new clothes.</v>

2415
01:04:48.121 --> 01:04:49.510
<v Speaker 3>When everybody in this country real,</v>

2416
01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:51.900
<v Speaker 3>it looks at every other sane person in this country and says,</v>

2417
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:52.951
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>

2418
01:04:52.951 --> 01:04:53.910
<v Speaker 3>this is all corrupt,</v>

2419
01:04:53.911 --> 01:04:54.241
<v Speaker 3>crooked.</v>

2420
01:04:54.241 --> 01:04:55.150
<v Speaker 3>We're not an,</v>

2421
01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:56.520
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden we all see it.</v>

2422
01:04:57.390 --> 01:05:00.480
<v Speaker 3>Do you think another country is going to get some sort of a nuclear power and</v>

2423
01:05:00.481 --> 01:05:01.410
<v Speaker 3>it's going to become an issue?</v>

2424
01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:03.210
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's what's going to happen to us?</v>

2425
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:04.260
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2426
01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:08.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is the only argument whatsoever about suppressing other nations.</v>

2427
01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:10.470
<v Speaker 1>The only argument that it's like,</v>

2428
01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:10.880
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2429
01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:12.060
<v Speaker 1>yeah we got nuclear power,</v>

2430
01:05:12.061 --> 01:05:14.040
<v Speaker 1>but nobody else can have it cause it's fucked up.</v>

2431
01:05:14.041 --> 01:05:14.821
<v Speaker 1>We used it once.</v>

2432
01:05:14.821 --> 01:05:15.990
<v Speaker 1>We feel real bad about it,</v>

2433
01:05:15.991 --> 01:05:17.010
<v Speaker 1>but we don't trust you with it.</v>

2434
01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:18.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean the idea</v>

2435
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:21.640
<v Speaker 5>that you would want to stop all these bad guys from creating nuclear power and</v>

2436
01:05:21.641 --> 01:05:22.090
<v Speaker 5>nuclear,</v>

2437
01:05:22.090 --> 01:05:23.080
<v Speaker 5>not nuclear power rather,</v>

2438
01:05:23.081 --> 01:05:25.900
<v Speaker 5>but nuclear weapons is something,</v>

2439
01:05:25.930 --> 01:05:27.490
<v Speaker 5>it's a consideration if you,</v>

2440
01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:29.920
<v Speaker 5>you're dealing with a really volatile country in the first place.</v>

2441
01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:34.440
<v Speaker 5>I think our biggest concern now is not some other nation getting cause it,</v>

2442
01:05:34.441 --> 01:05:39.430
<v Speaker 5>it's enormously expensive and energy intensive to enrich uranium and,</v>

2443
01:05:39.431 --> 01:05:40.660
<v Speaker 5>and to make the warheads.</v>

2444
01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:41.441
<v Speaker 5>Believe me,</v>

2445
01:05:41.441 --> 01:05:42.560
<v Speaker 5>that's what I come from.</v>

2446
01:05:42.561 --> 01:05:44.710
<v Speaker 5>It's a background that I come from when I had the clearance,</v>

2447
01:05:44.711 --> 01:05:46.150
<v Speaker 5>when I was living with my parents.</v>

2448
01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:47.290
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2449
01:05:47.290 --> 01:05:50.500
<v Speaker 5>so I don't think we need to worry about anybody learning how to do it or making</v>

2450
01:05:50.501 --> 01:05:50.681
<v Speaker 5>new.</v>

2451
01:05:50.681 --> 01:05:52.540
<v Speaker 5>What we've got is,</v>

2452
01:05:52.570 --> 01:05:52.990
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2453
01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:57.370
<v Speaker 5>is hundreds of thousands of nuclear that are already out that it's already</v>

2454
01:05:57.371 --> 01:05:57.611
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

2455
01:05:57.611 --> 01:05:58.390
<v Speaker 5>We've got an,</v>

2456
01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:59.070
<v Speaker 5>there's a,</v>

2457
01:05:59.070 --> 01:06:00.460
<v Speaker 5>so we shouldn't be worried about Iran.</v>

2458
01:06:00.610 --> 01:06:03.430
<v Speaker 5>We should be worried about the shit that was missing in the Soviet Union.</v>

2459
01:06:03.510 --> 01:06:04.343
<v Speaker 5>We just had,</v>

2460
01:06:04.370 --> 01:06:07.990
<v Speaker 5>we just put up a story on collapsed that it was from a Japanese paper,</v>

2461
01:06:08.070 --> 01:06:08.903
<v Speaker 5>a</v>

2462
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:11.051
<v Speaker 5>maximally remember,</v>

2463
01:06:11.051 --> 01:06:15.640
<v Speaker 5>but it was a good Japanese paper that there's like 700 pounds of enriched</v>

2464
01:06:15.641 --> 01:06:18.310
<v Speaker 5>uranium that are missing from Fukushima.</v>

2465
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:20.263
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2466
01:06:20.290 --> 01:06:23.200
<v Speaker 5>This stuff is swimming all over the world right now.</v>

2467
01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:25.870
<v Speaker 5>So enriched uranium,</v>

2468
01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:28.300
<v Speaker 5>if you refresh my memory,</v>

2469
01:06:28.330 --> 01:06:28.990
<v Speaker 5>it is a,</v>

2470
01:06:28.990 --> 01:06:31.750
<v Speaker 5>was it enriched your eye product anyway?</v>

2471
01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:32.950
<v Speaker 5>Enriched uranium is like,</v>

2472
01:06:32.951 --> 01:06:33.940
<v Speaker 5>that's the stuff that they,</v>

2473
01:06:33.941 --> 01:06:34.231
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2474
01:06:34.231 --> 01:06:34.780
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2475
01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:37.990
<v Speaker 5>the issues with a weapons and Gulf War syndrome,</v>

2476
01:06:37.991 --> 01:06:38.824
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2477
01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:39.281
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2478
01:06:39.281 --> 01:06:40.114
<v Speaker 5>that's the same.</v>

2479
01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:40.800
<v Speaker 5>Pleated,</v>

2480
01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:41.740
<v Speaker 5>you're depleted uranium.</v>

2481
01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:43.980
<v Speaker 5>That's different and enriched uranium is,</v>

2482
01:06:43.981 --> 01:06:44.171
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

2483
01:06:44.171 --> 01:06:44.501
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

2484
01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:48.190
<v Speaker 5>is uranium nuclear weapons grade that you process with,</v>

2485
01:06:48.191 --> 01:06:53.191
<v Speaker 5>with heavy water was centrifuges with in various ways to concentrate the atoms</v>

2486
01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:54.520
<v Speaker 5>of a,</v>

2487
01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:58.420
<v Speaker 5>it's either you to 35 or two to 38 that give you the energy,</v>

2488
01:06:58.421 --> 01:06:58.741
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

2489
01:06:58.741 --> 01:07:01.720
<v Speaker 5>it's like packing the punch to enrich it,</v>

2490
01:07:01.890 --> 01:07:02.320
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2491
01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:05.410
<v Speaker 5>to make it fissile so that in a reactor,</v>

2492
01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:06.310
<v Speaker 5>when you pull the radio,</v>

2493
01:07:06.370 --> 01:07:09.710
<v Speaker 5>it'll create the heat because all a nuclear reactor really is,</v>

2494
01:07:09.711 --> 01:07:10.930
<v Speaker 5>is a boiling water pot.</v>

2495
01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:13.230
<v Speaker 5>Albert Einstein,</v>

2496
01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:13.430
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

2497
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:15.070
<v Speaker 5>look at the first nuclear reactor.</v>

2498
01:07:15.071 --> 01:07:16.660
<v Speaker 5>He said it's a hell of a way to boil water.</v>

2499
01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:20.080
<v Speaker 5>And that's where all the energy comes from out of every nuclear plant.</v>

2500
01:07:20.081 --> 01:07:21.670
<v Speaker 5>It's just boiling water and steam.</v>

2501
01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:22.840
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2502
01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:23.673
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2503
01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:23.801
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2504
01:07:23.801 --> 01:07:24.820
<v Speaker 5>Most people don't even know.</v>

2505
01:07:24.850 --> 01:07:27.790
<v Speaker 5>They just know that there's a nuclear reactor and they figure somehow or another</v>

2506
01:07:27.791 --> 01:07:30.070
<v Speaker 5>they get that into an electricity line or something.</v>

2507
01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:30.821
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

2508
01:07:30.821 --> 01:07:31.330
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2509
01:07:31.330 --> 01:07:34.270
<v Speaker 5>the idea behind it is when you look at it that way,</v>

2510
01:07:34.271 --> 01:07:34.571
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

2511
01:07:34.571 --> 01:07:34.811
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

2512
01:07:34.811 --> 01:07:35.561
<v Speaker 5>that's pretty crazy.</v>

2513
01:07:35.561 --> 01:07:36.310
<v Speaker 5>Primitive.</v>

2514
01:07:36.310 --> 01:07:37.143
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2515
01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:37.571
<v Speaker 5>What,</v>

2516
01:07:37.571 --> 01:07:37.780
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2517
01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:39.640
<v Speaker 5>what a nutty fucking animal.</v>

2518
01:07:39.641 --> 01:07:43.390
<v Speaker 5>Human beings splitting atoms for our own power.</v>

2519
01:07:43.391 --> 01:07:44.380
<v Speaker 5>And when the,</v>

2520
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:45.190
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2521
01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:46.570
<v Speaker 5>when they shut off or they,</v>

2522
01:07:46.610 --> 01:07:47.230
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2523
01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:48.310
<v Speaker 5>get hit by a tsunami,</v>

2524
01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:48.910
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2525
01:07:48.910 --> 01:07:49.900
<v Speaker 5>here's the catch.</v>

2526
01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:52.630
<v Speaker 5>As collapse proceeds,</v>

2527
01:07:52.750 --> 01:07:53.030
<v Speaker 5>as,</v>

2528
01:07:53.030 --> 01:07:53.270
<v Speaker 5>as,</v>

2529
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:54.550
<v Speaker 5>as it gets worse as nations,</v>

2530
01:07:54.551 --> 01:07:54.701
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2531
01:07:54.701 --> 01:07:55.810
<v Speaker 5>we're seeing sovereign debt.</v>

2532
01:07:55.810 --> 01:07:57.190
<v Speaker 5>Government's going bankrupt.</v>

2533
01:07:58.120 --> 01:07:59.230
<v Speaker 5>Tepco is going bankrupt.</v>

2534
01:07:59.231 --> 01:08:00.370
<v Speaker 5>Japan's going to nationalize it,</v>

2535
01:08:00.371 --> 01:08:02.740
<v Speaker 5>but Japan's got a bigger debt than anybody else,</v>

2536
01:08:02.770 --> 01:08:03.151
<v Speaker 5>et Cetera,</v>

2537
01:08:03.151 --> 01:08:03.970
<v Speaker 5>et cetera.</v>

2538
01:08:03.970 --> 01:08:08.410
<v Speaker 5>I as collapse proceeds are our ability to deal with Fukushima,</v>

2539
01:08:08.411 --> 01:08:13.411
<v Speaker 5>like events is going to diminish their 450 nuclear reactors in the world that</v>

2540
01:08:14.441 --> 01:08:15.020
<v Speaker 5>are running.</v>

2541
01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:18.140
<v Speaker 5>And if we don't shut them down and collapse proceeds,</v>

2542
01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:19.490
<v Speaker 5>they're going to kill everything anyway.</v>

2543
01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:22.310
<v Speaker 5>How the fuck did we get this screwed up so quickly?</v>

2544
01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:22.911
<v Speaker 5>Pretty Stupid,</v>

2545
01:08:22.911 --> 01:08:23.300
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>

2546
01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:24.133
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>

2547
01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:25.700
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing what an impact.</v>

2548
01:08:25.701 --> 01:08:28.790
<v Speaker 5>Just the last few hundred years humans have had on the earth.</v>

2549
01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:29.930
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2550
01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:33.740
<v Speaker 5>think about how innocuous we were for the first million years of our existence</v>

2551
01:08:34.250 --> 01:08:35.540
<v Speaker 5>and the last couple of hundred years.</v>

2552
01:08:35.541 --> 01:08:40.250
<v Speaker 5>We just like a firecracker with a long fuse that that last couple hundred years</v>

2553
01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:41.113
<v Speaker 5>was energy.</v>

2554
01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:46.190
<v Speaker 5>That's when we discovered the energy's amazing coal oil is,</v>

2555
01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:46.470
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2556
01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:48.170
<v Speaker 5>why can't we see what we're doing?</v>

2557
01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:48.441
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2558
01:08:48.441 --> 01:08:48.770
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

2559
01:08:48.770 --> 01:08:48.980
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

2560
01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:53.840
<v Speaker 5>What kind of a weird thing are people where they have such an amazing ability to</v>

2561
01:08:53.841 --> 01:08:58.820
<v Speaker 5>control their environment and to influence their environment and we can't,</v>

2562
01:08:58.821 --> 01:08:59.870
<v Speaker 5>for whatever reason,</v>

2563
01:08:59.871 --> 01:09:02.780
<v Speaker 5>we can't feel what we're doing bad to the environment.</v>

2564
01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:07.930
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like we have much more power and much more ability than we have the</v>

2565
01:09:08.121 --> 01:09:12.260
<v Speaker 5>natural ability to perceive the impact of this power.</v>

2566
01:09:12.290 --> 01:09:12.610
<v Speaker 5>That's the,</v>

2567
01:09:12.610 --> 01:09:13.220
<v Speaker 5>it's almost like,</v>

2568
01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:13.521
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2569
01:09:13.521 --> 01:09:14.190
<v Speaker 5>the disconnect.</v>

2570
01:09:14.190 --> 01:09:14.871
<v Speaker 5>That's that's,</v>

2571
01:09:14.871 --> 01:09:15.920
<v Speaker 5>that's what happened.</v>

2572
01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:16.701
<v Speaker 5>It's what it is.</v>

2573
01:09:16.701 --> 01:09:16.881
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2574
01:09:16.881 --> 01:09:21.860
<v Speaker 5>When when the devil or whoever it was wrote that into genesis one saying God</v>

2575
01:09:21.861 --> 01:09:22.130
<v Speaker 5>saying,</v>

2576
01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:24.110
<v Speaker 5>I give you dominion over this earth.</v>

2577
01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:25.640
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2578
01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:27.260
<v Speaker 5>see we are not,</v>

2579
01:09:27.261 --> 01:09:31.010
<v Speaker 5>God is in a mad scramble to figure it out.</v>

2580
01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:31.873
<v Speaker 5>Is that what it is?</v>

2581
01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:32.211
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2582
01:09:32.211 --> 01:09:37.040
<v Speaker 5>do you think that the way humans have to evolve at an incredibly rapid pace like</v>

2583
01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:39.500
<v Speaker 5>sociologically or consciously to test it,</v>

2584
01:09:39.501 --> 01:09:43.340
<v Speaker 5>try to catch up with the technology that's evolving around us?</v>

2585
01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:47.000
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like this mad scramble is in place.</v>

2586
01:09:47.001 --> 01:09:48.560
<v Speaker 5>It almost has to be in place.</v>

2587
01:09:48.561 --> 01:09:50.350
<v Speaker 5>Just to keep up with where we are.</v>

2588
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:51.860
<v Speaker 5>Technology is going.</v>

2589
01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:56.480
<v Speaker 5>I call that I gave a speech in a grass valley that's up on the collapse,</v>

2590
01:09:56.481 --> 01:09:57.314
<v Speaker 5>that website,</v>

2591
01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:59.630
<v Speaker 5>the speech was called the birth of post petroleum human.</v>

2592
01:10:00.050 --> 01:10:01.460
<v Speaker 5>And I coined a line in that,</v>

2593
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:02.100
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2594
01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:02.720
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

2595
01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:02.970
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

2596
01:10:02.970 --> 01:10:03.711
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

2597
01:10:03.711 --> 01:10:08.630
<v Speaker 5>the people of the posts of the new consciousness will live in the spaces between</v>

2598
01:10:08.631 --> 01:10:11.630
<v Speaker 5>the ones and the Zeros of Cartesian tyranny.</v>

2599
01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:13.333
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2600
01:10:13.490 --> 01:10:15.470
<v Speaker 5>that's pretty bad ass where they can't get us.</v>

2601
01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:16.610
<v Speaker 5>That should be on a hallmark card,</v>

2602
01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:17.100
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2603
01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:17.450
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2604
01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:17.770
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2605
01:10:17.770 --> 01:10:18.220
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2606
01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:18.690
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

2607
01:10:18.690 --> 01:10:20.150
<v Speaker 5>but that's what this is,</v>

2608
01:10:20.151 --> 01:10:20.361
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2609
01:10:20.361 --> 01:10:21.130
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>

2610
01:10:21.130 --> 01:10:24.020
<v Speaker 5>this is like Cartesian tyranny is like somebody's,</v>

2611
01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:25.273
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2612
01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:26.780
<v Speaker 5>somebody's hitting the crack pipe,</v>

2613
01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:27.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2614
01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:30.200
<v Speaker 5>just two seconds before they die and they weigh eight pounds.</v>

2615
01:10:30.201 --> 01:10:30.970
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2616
01:10:30.970 --> 01:10:31.803
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2617
01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:32.330
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2618
01:10:32.330 --> 01:10:35.600
<v Speaker 5>it's insane because it's supreme,</v>

2619
01:10:35.601 --> 01:10:36.620
<v Speaker 5>supremely arrogant.</v>

2620
01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:37.410
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2621
01:10:37.410 --> 01:10:37.940
<v Speaker 5>in other words,</v>

2622
01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:38.301
<v Speaker 5>one's,</v>

2623
01:10:38.301 --> 01:10:40.580
<v Speaker 5>and zero's can't measure heart and soul,</v>

2624
01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:42.110
<v Speaker 5>but music does,</v>

2625
01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:44.270
<v Speaker 5>fighting does.</v>

2626
01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:45.673
<v Speaker 5>And there's no,</v>

2627
01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:47.630
<v Speaker 5>that's not a one in zero thing.</v>

2628
01:10:47.631 --> 01:10:47.891
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2629
01:10:47.891 --> 01:10:51.230
<v Speaker 5>it's something that exists outside of that,</v>

2630
01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:53.300
<v Speaker 5>of those measurements and those controls.</v>

2631
01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:54.860
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2632
01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:59.450
<v Speaker 5>and that's really what I think the occupy movement is really exemplifying really</v>

2633
01:10:59.451 --> 01:10:59.661
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>

2634
01:10:59.661 --> 01:11:04.640
<v Speaker 5>So they feel victimized by ones and Zeros in the manipulation and corruption of</v>

2635
01:11:04.641 --> 01:11:08.930
<v Speaker 5>the system that manages the ones and Zeros and they're screaming out from the</v>

2636
01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:12.350
<v Speaker 5>visceral part of their there from the mind,</v>

2637
01:11:12.351 --> 01:11:14.340
<v Speaker 5>from the instinct that's telling them this</v>

2638
01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:15.600
<v Speaker 3>is a fucking mess.</v>

2639
01:11:15.690 --> 01:11:16.890
<v Speaker 3>So when that woman says,</v>

2640
01:11:17.010 --> 01:11:17.581
<v Speaker 3>or when they say,</v>

2641
01:11:17.581 --> 01:11:18.440
<v Speaker 3>what are you occupying?</v>

2642
01:11:18.450 --> 01:11:20.130
<v Speaker 3>She says everything.</v>

2643
01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:21.383
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

2644
01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:21.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2645
01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:25.320
<v Speaker 3>When I was saying that the occupy people are sorta like white blood cells and</v>

2646
01:11:25.321 --> 01:11:28.440
<v Speaker 3>they're just gathering around illness and they don't even know what they're</v>

2647
01:11:28.441 --> 01:11:29.274
<v Speaker 3>going to do with it,</v>

2648
01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:29.821
<v Speaker 3>but they're,</v>

2649
01:11:29.821 --> 01:11:32.100
<v Speaker 3>they're gathering around all the six spots.</v>

2650
01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:33.630
<v Speaker 3>There was a reason why.</v>

2651
01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:34.523
<v Speaker 3>And I got,</v>

2652
01:11:34.650 --> 01:11:38.320
<v Speaker 3>I got deeply involved in that when I saw the violence.</v>

2653
01:11:38.330 --> 01:11:40.380
<v Speaker 3>And I've been an activist a long time and I know,</v>

2654
01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:43.740
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of veterans in the La Special Forces and seals.</v>

2655
01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:48.420
<v Speaker 3>When I saw Oakland and when I saw that all the unforgivable violence,</v>

2656
01:11:48.450 --> 01:11:50.520
<v Speaker 3>I was a good scar in the city.</v>

2657
01:11:50.521 --> 01:11:51.240
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

2658
01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:52.170
<v Speaker 3>I was sick.</v>

2659
01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:54.840
<v Speaker 3>I was as sick as I was when I saw the Rodney King beating happened.</v>

2660
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:55.081
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2661
01:11:55.081 --> 01:11:56.250
<v Speaker 3>I was just sick to my heart,</v>

2662
01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:58.020
<v Speaker 3>but so were many of us.</v>

2663
01:11:58.500 --> 01:11:59.031
<v Speaker 3>And once you,</v>

2664
01:11:59.031 --> 01:12:00.090
<v Speaker 3>Mark Thomas did his thing,</v>

2665
01:12:00.091 --> 01:12:01.710
<v Speaker 3>she Mars has been a guest on my radio show.</v>

2666
01:12:01.711 --> 01:12:03.390
<v Speaker 3>I love what he's way cool.</v>

2667
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:04.040
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

2668
01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:04.180
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2669
01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:06.000
<v Speaker 3>he's having a hard time dealing with a celebrity.</v>

2670
01:12:06.001 --> 01:12:06.930
<v Speaker 3>I say get used to it,</v>

2671
01:12:06.931 --> 01:12:07.764
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2672
01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:08.460
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2673
01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:09.293
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2674
01:12:09.630 --> 01:12:14.070
<v Speaker 3>but there were so many of us at so many levels who stepped up because we were so</v>

2675
01:12:14.071 --> 01:12:15.840
<v Speaker 3>totally offended by that.</v>

2676
01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:16.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2677
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:21.660
<v Speaker 3>but occupy was threatening and the reason occupies threatened and there was a</v>

2678
01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:25.590
<v Speaker 3>homeland security coordinated the shut down of all the cities.</v>

2679
01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:26.610
<v Speaker 3>We had that on collapsing there.</v>

2680
01:12:27.650 --> 01:12:28.470
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2681
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:29.310
<v Speaker 3>we threatened them.</v>

2682
01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:30.750
<v Speaker 3>The tent was so,</v>

2683
01:12:30.751 --> 01:12:33.810
<v Speaker 3>it's such a powerful symbol because you've never seen a fucking mortgage on a</v>

2684
01:12:33.811 --> 01:12:34.141
<v Speaker 3>tent,</v>

2685
01:12:34.141 --> 01:12:34.974
<v Speaker 3>have you?</v>

2686
01:12:36.410 --> 01:12:36.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2687
01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:37.260
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2688
01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:38.100
<v Speaker 3>It's freedom.</v>

2689
01:12:38.730 --> 01:12:39.810
<v Speaker 3>That's the symbol.</v>

2690
01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:42.540
<v Speaker 3>And in the space that was created in,</v>

2691
01:12:42.541 --> 01:12:42.781
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2692
01:12:42.781 --> 01:12:45.180
<v Speaker 3>in my spirituality is it's very important to create an hold,</v>

2693
01:12:45.181 --> 01:12:46.110
<v Speaker 3>a sacred space.</v>

2694
01:12:46.650 --> 01:12:47.011
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2695
01:12:47.011 --> 01:12:48.660
<v Speaker 3>where the magic can happen.</v>

2696
01:12:48.661 --> 01:12:50.070
<v Speaker 3>And the occupy spaces,</v>

2697
01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:51.690
<v Speaker 3>there was such magic happening.</v>

2698
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:56.310
<v Speaker 3>People were connecting and people were waking up to each other and the learning</v>

2699
01:12:56.311 --> 01:12:57.570
<v Speaker 3>curve was going self.</v>

2700
01:12:57.930 --> 01:12:58.141
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2701
01:12:58.141 --> 01:12:58.411
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2702
01:12:58.411 --> 01:12:59.244
<v Speaker 3>Listen to me.</v>

2703
01:12:59.550 --> 01:13:01.530
<v Speaker 3>And people were just figuring shit out.</v>

2704
01:13:01.850 --> 01:13:03.030
<v Speaker 3>One of the first things that,</v>

2705
01:13:03.031 --> 01:13:03.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2706
01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:07.860
<v Speaker 3>Nyp Dee took out a Ducati park was the library they had to get and they threw</v>

2707
01:13:07.861 --> 01:13:09.940
<v Speaker 3>all the books away and all of my books were in there.</v>

2708
01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:10.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2709
01:13:10.750 --> 01:13:14.550
<v Speaker 3>They took them right to a dumpster and disposed of them because people would</v>

2710
01:13:14.551 --> 01:13:18.090
<v Speaker 3>just be in the library the entire time the light people were coming.</v>

2711
01:13:18.091 --> 01:13:20.490
<v Speaker 3>People were unplugging from the Matrix.</v>

2712
01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:21.361
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2713
01:13:21.361 --> 01:13:23.580
<v Speaker 3>but why would they get rid of the library just to,</v>

2714
01:13:23.581 --> 01:13:24.820
<v Speaker 3>because they were using it.</v>

2715
01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:27.910
<v Speaker 3>They were hanging out there like why would they close the library and through</v>

2716
01:13:27.911 --> 01:13:28.530
<v Speaker 3>all the books away,</v>

2717
01:13:28.530 --> 01:13:30.620
<v Speaker 3>why did Hitler burned the books really mean.</v>

2718
01:13:30.650 --> 01:13:31.110
<v Speaker 3>So they're,</v>

2719
01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:31.410
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

2720
01:13:31.410 --> 01:13:32.850
<v Speaker 3>they're worried that the,</v>

2721
01:13:32.851 --> 01:13:36.280
<v Speaker 3>that's where they're going to get all their information from this library or</v>

2722
01:13:36.281 --> 01:13:37.020
<v Speaker 3>what their phrase,</v>

2723
01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:38.340
<v Speaker 3>it just a place to hang out.</v>

2724
01:13:38.341 --> 01:13:39.240
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to eliminate,</v>

2725
01:13:39.410 --> 01:13:39.570
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2726
01:13:39.570 --> 01:13:42.830
<v Speaker 3>what gay sex this is.</v>

2727
01:13:43.090 --> 01:13:43.660
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2728
01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:44.800
<v Speaker 3>it's a big science that,</v>

2729
01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:45.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2730
01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:46.830
<v Speaker 3>in mass psychology,</v>

2731
01:13:46.831 --> 01:13:48.510
<v Speaker 3>when you reach a certain percentage of the people,</v>

2732
01:13:48.511 --> 01:13:50.070
<v Speaker 3>7% solution of whatever it is,</v>

2733
01:13:50.071 --> 01:13:51.660
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden everybody starts getting it.</v>

2734
01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:53.550
<v Speaker 3>That's what they were afraid of.</v>

2735
01:13:54.450 --> 01:13:55.050
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2736
01:13:55.050 --> 01:13:56.400
<v Speaker 3>so they close the library,</v>

2737
01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:57.660
<v Speaker 3>they didn't close it.</v>

2738
01:13:57.661 --> 01:13:58.190
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

2739
01:13:58.190 --> 01:13:58.520
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2740
01:13:58.520 --> 01:13:58.930
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2741
01:13:58.930 --> 01:13:59.990
<v Speaker 3>they throw the books away.</v>

2742
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.680
<v Speaker 3>They did the equivalent of burning the books.</v>

2743
01:14:01.681 --> 01:14:02.550
<v Speaker 3>They disposed of them.</v>

2744
01:14:02.970 --> 01:14:03.803
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2745
01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:07.620
<v Speaker 3>That's because there were a couple thousand bucks and then anybody could really</v>

2746
01:14:07.621 --> 01:14:09.510
<v Speaker 3>rationalize that being a good idea.</v>

2747
01:14:09.870 --> 01:14:10.703
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

2748
01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:11.411
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

2749
01:14:11.411 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2750
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:12.700
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2751
01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:16.300
<v Speaker 6>and that's the other thing about this NBA thing drives me crazy.</v>

2752
01:14:16.301 --> 01:14:17.050
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2753
01:14:17.050 --> 01:14:22.050
<v Speaker 6>Or Nda I national defense authorization act where they're proposing that they</v>

2754
01:14:22.091 --> 01:14:23.350
<v Speaker 6>can just arrest people.</v>

2755
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:24.970
<v Speaker 6>They don't have to have a warrant.</v>

2756
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:25.990
<v Speaker 6>They just have to have a,</v>

2757
01:14:25.991 --> 01:14:26.190
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2758
01:14:26.190 --> 01:14:29.380
<v Speaker 6>an idea that somehow or another you were a threat to America and they can</v>

2759
01:14:29.381 --> 01:14:32.230
<v Speaker 6>indefinitely suspend you and they won't do it because they're good guys.</v>

2760
01:14:32.231 --> 01:14:32.830
<v Speaker 6>Don't worry.</v>

2761
01:14:32.830 --> 01:14:33.221
<v Speaker 6>It's just,</v>

2762
01:14:33.221 --> 01:14:34.054
<v Speaker 6>just in case.</v>

2763
01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:34.391
<v Speaker 6>But no,</v>

2764
01:14:34.391 --> 01:14:36.550
<v Speaker 6>you can't have just in case that's crazy.</v>

2765
01:14:37.090 --> 01:14:40.030
<v Speaker 6>It's crazy that it's gotten to the point where anybody would even consider</v>

2766
01:14:40.031 --> 01:14:40.660
<v Speaker 6>saying yes,</v>

2767
01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:45.140
<v Speaker 7>do you know in Japan they can just arrest you for 29 days and in those 29 days</v>

2768
01:14:45.141 --> 01:14:46.040
<v Speaker 7>they can torture you.</v>

2769
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:49.880
<v Speaker 7>And most of the time they'll get people to like say things or write things off</v>

2770
01:14:49.881 --> 01:14:50.714
<v Speaker 7>and then they'll,</v>

2771
01:14:50.770 --> 01:14:51.110
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2772
01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:52.430
<v Speaker 7>prosecute them completely.</v>

2773
01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:53.200
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

2774
01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:54.100
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

2775
01:14:54.101 --> 01:14:58.600
<v Speaker 4>It's written in the u s constitution and the bill of Rights Congress shall pass</v>

2776
01:14:58.660 --> 01:14:59.800
<v Speaker 4>no law.</v>

2777
01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:01.143
<v Speaker 4>Boom.</v>

2778
01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:02.170
<v Speaker 4>Freedom of speech.</v>

2779
01:15:02.350 --> 01:15:02.921
<v Speaker 4>Everything else.</v>

2780
01:15:02.921 --> 01:15:03.280
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2781
01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:08.280
<v Speaker 4>The bill of Rights Congress has just passed a law that violates the constitution</v>

2782
01:15:10.210 --> 01:15:12.210
<v Speaker 4>and the president wants it and he,</v>

2783
01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:15.380
<v Speaker 4>and he hasn't signed it because we made bloody for rock.</v>

2784
01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:19.540
<v Speaker 4>Still hasn't signed as far as I can tell you today is a huge outcry.</v>

2785
01:15:19.570 --> 01:15:19.961
<v Speaker 4>What is today?</v>

2786
01:15:19.961 --> 01:15:20.680
<v Speaker 4>The 25th,</v>

2787
01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:21.161
<v Speaker 4>27th,</v>

2788
01:15:21.161 --> 01:15:21.994
<v Speaker 4>seventh.</v>

2789
01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:22.361
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2790
01:15:22.361 --> 01:15:23.260
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know what date is.</v>

2791
01:15:23.890 --> 01:15:24.790
<v Speaker 4>December 27th.</v>

2792
01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:24.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2793
01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:25.141
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2794
01:15:25.141 --> 01:15:25.960
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2795
01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:27.630
<v Speaker 4>so he'd be,</v>

2796
01:15:27.670 --> 01:15:28.720
<v Speaker 4>he probably will.</v>

2797
01:15:29.050 --> 01:15:29.650
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2798
01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:30.550
<v Speaker 4>has he expressed,</v>

2799
01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:32.500
<v Speaker 4>do you mean he said he would veto it initially,</v>

2800
01:15:32.501 --> 01:15:32.711
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2801
01:15:32.711 --> 01:15:33.550
<v Speaker 4>A long time ago,</v>

2802
01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:34.720
<v Speaker 4>didn't they?</v>

2803
01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:35.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2804
01:15:35.711 --> 01:15:36.544
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>

2805
01:15:37.210 --> 01:15:38.080
<v Speaker 4>Not that I've heard.</v>

2806
01:15:38.081 --> 01:15:38.251
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2807
01:15:38.251 --> 01:15:39.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm expecting him to sign it.</v>

2808
01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:42.820
<v Speaker 6>I had read somewhere that when it was first being proposed to,</v>

2809
01:15:42.821 --> 01:15:45.420
<v Speaker 6>people weren't worried if it got through the Senate because the president said</v>

2810
01:15:45.421 --> 01:15:46.254
<v Speaker 6>he would veto it.</v>

2811
01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:50.520
<v Speaker 4>Do you think it's possible the president lies so,</v>

2812
01:15:50.890 --> 01:15:51.670
<v Speaker 6>so shocking.</v>

2813
01:15:51.670 --> 01:15:54.640
<v Speaker 6>It's just so shocking that they would literally change what America is.</v>

2814
01:15:54.670 --> 01:15:59.670
<v Speaker 6>The whole idea of America is land of the free home of the brave with liberty and</v>

2815
01:15:59.831 --> 01:16:01.300
<v Speaker 6>justice for all.</v>

2816
01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:05.410
<v Speaker 6>That was like the founding principles of this great experiment,</v>

2817
01:16:05.710 --> 01:16:07.750
<v Speaker 6>liberty and justice,</v>

2818
01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:12.130
<v Speaker 6>and those words are so fucking important because people don't understand this.</v>

2819
01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:12.550
<v Speaker 6>They are.</v>

2820
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:16.690
<v Speaker 6>This idea of security being more important is absolutely fucking crazy because</v>

2821
01:16:16.691 --> 01:16:17.410
<v Speaker 6>guess what?</v>

2822
01:16:17.410 --> 01:16:19.240
<v Speaker 6>You're were pretty God damn secure.</v>

2823
01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:19.601
<v Speaker 6>You have,</v>

2824
01:16:19.601 --> 01:16:20.350
<v Speaker 6>you feel like,</v>

2825
01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:21.190
<v Speaker 6>do you feel bad?</v>

2826
01:16:21.191 --> 01:16:24.400
<v Speaker 6>Do you feel like they're the enemies all around you and terrorism is everywhere</v>

2827
01:16:24.401 --> 01:16:24.731
<v Speaker 6>you look,</v>

2828
01:16:24.731 --> 01:16:25.390
<v Speaker 6>it's not.</v>

2829
01:16:25.390 --> 01:16:29.440
<v Speaker 6>It's not just a few isolated examples and they're using those isolated examples</v>

2830
01:16:29.441 --> 01:16:31.840
<v Speaker 6>to fuck you and to control.</v>

2831
01:16:31.841 --> 01:16:33.010
<v Speaker 6>You complete that down.</v>

2832
01:16:33.011 --> 01:16:36.670
<v Speaker 6>Seven year old girls in the airport make you stand where you're weenies hanging</v>

2833
01:16:36.671 --> 01:16:37.820
<v Speaker 6>in the x ray machine.</v>

2834
01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:38.291
<v Speaker 6>They listen.</v>

2835
01:16:38.291 --> 01:16:38.451
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

2836
01:16:38.451 --> 01:16:40.330
<v Speaker 6>I'm all for them doing,</v>

2837
01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:40.661
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2838
01:16:40.661 --> 01:16:42.490
<v Speaker 6>airport security the right way.</v>

2839
01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:43.930
<v Speaker 6>I think it's a good idea.</v>

2840
01:16:43.931 --> 01:16:44.711
<v Speaker 6>It's a smaller deal.</v>

2841
01:16:44.711 --> 01:16:46.090
<v Speaker 6>They've caught some people doing thumbs,</v>

2842
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:48.550
<v Speaker 6>but have you give people power over other people?</v>

2843
01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:52.660
<v Speaker 6>I've seen people at the airport and they may be just had a bad day or maybe they</v>

2844
01:16:52.661 --> 01:16:53.740
<v Speaker 6>were tired or whatever,</v>

2845
01:16:53.741 --> 01:16:57.880
<v Speaker 6>but I've seen them talk to people and they're kind of shitty dorm and real short</v>

2846
01:16:57.881 --> 01:16:58.480
<v Speaker 6>to him.</v>

2847
01:16:58.480 --> 01:16:59.530
<v Speaker 6>And I've seen the opposite.</v>

2848
01:16:59.531 --> 01:17:02.170
<v Speaker 6>I've seen people at the TSA that are real friendly and real cool.</v>

2849
01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:07.380
<v Speaker 6>And whenever you have that possibility that a human being's day and emotions and</v>

2850
01:17:07.481 --> 01:17:09.440
<v Speaker 6>that factors into how someone is,</v>

2851
01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:12.010
<v Speaker 6>is a interrogated or someone is a,</v>

2852
01:17:12.011 --> 01:17:14.450
<v Speaker 6>it is handled going through the airport,</v>

2853
01:17:14.451 --> 01:17:17.000
<v Speaker 6>that someone could just be in a bad mood and be short and snippy,</v>

2854
01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:17.720
<v Speaker 6>then I'll send,</v>

2855
01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:19.460
<v Speaker 6>that shouldn't be even in the equation.</v>

2856
01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:22.160
<v Speaker 6>That shouldn't be something that people have to deal with when it comes to</v>

2857
01:17:22.161 --> 01:17:22.940
<v Speaker 6>security.</v>

2858
01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:24.940
<v Speaker 6>None of that stuff should be in the equation anyway.</v>

2859
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:25.281
<v Speaker 6>It should.</v>

2860
01:17:25.281 --> 01:17:25.450
<v Speaker 6>If,</v>

2861
01:17:25.450 --> 01:17:26.450
<v Speaker 6>if at anything,</v>

2862
01:17:26.451 --> 01:17:28.610
<v Speaker 6>it should be something nice and simple,</v>

2863
01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:29.470
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2864
01:17:29.470 --> 01:17:30.980
<v Speaker 6>just that's conditioning.</v>

2865
01:17:30.981 --> 01:17:31.131
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2866
01:17:31.131 --> 01:17:31.461
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

2867
01:17:31.461 --> 01:17:32.001
<v Speaker 6>that's training,</v>

2868
01:17:32.001 --> 01:17:35.830
<v Speaker 6>that's getting you used to being fucked with and so,</v>

2869
01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:37.570
<v Speaker 6>and it's so terrifying to,</v>

2870
01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:41.390
<v Speaker 6>to think that it's possible that there's people out there that would allow</v>

2871
01:17:41.391 --> 01:17:44.810
<v Speaker 6>things to happen just to tighten down security.</v>

2872
01:17:45.210 --> 01:17:48.710
<v Speaker 6>They would allow things that they knew could possibly be taking place.</v>

2873
01:17:48.711 --> 01:17:50.780
<v Speaker 6>Let it happen now way once it does,</v>

2874
01:17:50.781 --> 01:17:54.710
<v Speaker 6>we'll tighten up this and this pass immediately and then we'll just stick that</v>

2875
01:17:54.711 --> 01:17:56.210
<v Speaker 6>right in the back door and no one's,</v>

2876
01:17:56.211 --> 01:17:57.044
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to say a word,</v>

2877
01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:57.711
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2878
01:17:57.711 --> 01:18:00.920
<v Speaker 6>nice businesses and nice government contracts for people who are the,</v>

2879
01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:01.280
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2880
01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:02.840
<v Speaker 6>the money gets laundered through all the guys.</v>

2881
01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:03.560
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's,</v>

2882
01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:04.393
<v Speaker 6>it's sick.</v>

2883
01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:08.900
<v Speaker 6>The whole thing is the world is governed by organized crime.</v>

2884
01:18:08.901 --> 01:18:09.980
<v Speaker 6>And if you think about a man,</v>

2885
01:18:10.370 --> 01:18:13.970
<v Speaker 6>can you point to any government anywhere in the world that you think is doing a</v>

2886
01:18:13.971 --> 01:18:14.511
<v Speaker 6>good job,</v>

2887
01:18:14.511 --> 01:18:15.321
<v Speaker 6>that it's people are going,</v>

2888
01:18:15.321 --> 01:18:15.561
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

2889
01:18:15.561 --> 01:18:19.520
<v Speaker 6>my government's really taking care of me now because they're all run by the</v>

2890
01:18:19.521 --> 01:18:20.354
<v Speaker 6>banks,</v>

2891
01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:22.213
<v Speaker 6>gangsters,</v>

2892
01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:25.460
<v Speaker 6>Dick Cheney's the most obvious gangster of all time.</v>

2893
01:18:25.461 --> 01:18:26.090
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2894
01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:27.410
<v Speaker 6>We see the most obvious.</v>

2895
01:18:27.710 --> 01:18:31.160
<v Speaker 6>Well that's aside from getting to the owners of the Fed,</v>

2896
01:18:31.161 --> 01:18:32.510
<v Speaker 6>the Bank of international settlements,</v>

2897
01:18:32.511 --> 01:18:33.231
<v Speaker 6>city of London,</v>

2898
01:18:33.231 --> 01:18:35.090
<v Speaker 6>finding out who those financial powers that be,</v>

2899
01:18:35.091 --> 01:18:35.900
<v Speaker 6>Dick Dick,</v>

2900
01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:37.630
<v Speaker 6>those people at the top of the food chains.</v>

2901
01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:38.301
<v Speaker 6>That's yeah.</v>

2902
01:18:38.301 --> 01:18:38.681
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

2903
01:18:38.681 --> 01:18:40.250
<v Speaker 6>and as a shadow government,</v>

2904
01:18:40.251 --> 01:18:43.640
<v Speaker 6>we're going to find out more and more about who they are as as things</v>

2905
01:18:43.970 --> 01:18:44.661
<v Speaker 6>deteriorate.</v>

2906
01:18:44.661 --> 01:18:46.080
<v Speaker 6>But Dick Dick Cheney is,</v>

2907
01:18:46.081 --> 01:18:46.701
<v Speaker 6>is far,</v>

2908
01:18:46.701 --> 01:18:50.810
<v Speaker 6>far and away the most evil senior manager I have ever seen in my life.</v>

2909
01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:52.910
<v Speaker 6>That's kind of what my book crossing the rubicons about,</v>

2910
01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.170
<v Speaker 6>along with a lot of other things.</v>

2911
01:18:54.171 --> 01:18:54.800
<v Speaker 6>But yeah,</v>

2912
01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:55.820
<v Speaker 6>he was a gangster.</v>

2913
01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:59.570
<v Speaker 6>I mean that guy shot his friend in the face and his friend apologized,</v>

2914
01:19:00.230 --> 01:19:00.620
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2915
01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:02.210
<v Speaker 6>that's his gangster as you get.</v>

2916
01:19:02.211 --> 01:19:03.530
<v Speaker 6>He was so terrifying.</v>

2917
01:19:03.531 --> 01:19:08.531
<v Speaker 6>A guy who made a living as the head of a company that fixes shit after we blow</v>

2918
01:19:10.311 --> 01:19:15.311
<v Speaker 6>it up and then he gets it off and blow shit up and then makes a fuck load of</v>

2919
01:19:15.951 --> 01:19:16.671
<v Speaker 6>money fixing it.</v>

2920
01:19:16.671 --> 01:19:18.440
<v Speaker 6>He killed 3,200 Americans.</v>

2921
01:19:18.441 --> 01:19:21.650
<v Speaker 6>And I say it in my book crossing the Rubicon proves that Dick Cheney was the</v>

2922
01:19:21.651 --> 01:19:25.010
<v Speaker 6>mastermind and executed September 11th I'll take it to court,</v>

2923
01:19:25.011 --> 01:19:26.480
<v Speaker 6>the books in the Harvard Business Library.</v>

2924
01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:31.070
<v Speaker 6>So you believe that he actually engineered it and it's not that they allowed</v>

2925
01:19:31.071 --> 01:19:31.701
<v Speaker 6>nine hello man,</v>

2926
01:19:31.701 --> 01:19:32.060
<v Speaker 6>heaven.</v>

2927
01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:35.690
<v Speaker 6>He commanded it and he did this to,</v>

2928
01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:39.890
<v Speaker 6>in order to get people excited about going to war with Iraq or and have whatever</v>

2929
01:19:39.891 --> 01:19:43.100
<v Speaker 6>power we wanted and he is fully aware of peak oil.</v>

2930
01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:46.280
<v Speaker 6>Iraq has the second largest oil reserves on the planet.</v>

2931
01:19:46.281 --> 01:19:49.220
<v Speaker 6>So the only way to do that was to allow planes or no,</v>

2932
01:19:49.221 --> 01:19:49.371
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

2933
01:19:49.371 --> 01:19:49.561
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>

2934
01:19:49.561 --> 01:19:50.900
<v Speaker 6>you're saying that he didn't even know.</v>

2935
01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:51.920
<v Speaker 6>He didn't allow it,</v>

2936
01:19:51.921 --> 01:19:53.540
<v Speaker 6>that he was a part of engineering it,</v>

2937
01:19:53.690 --> 01:19:54.570
<v Speaker 6>that he was a party.</v>

2938
01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:54.981
<v Speaker 6>Like he,</v>

2939
01:19:54.981 --> 01:19:56.450
<v Speaker 6>he literally said,</v>

2940
01:19:56.451 --> 01:19:57.320
<v Speaker 6>this is what we're going to do.</v>

2941
01:19:57.321 --> 01:20:00.690
<v Speaker 6>We're going to take some planes and we're going to fly one of these buildings to</v>

2942
01:20:00.730 --> 01:20:00.861
<v Speaker 6>do.</v>

2943
01:20:00.861 --> 01:20:02.120
<v Speaker 6>People fly those planes.</v>

2944
01:20:02.121 --> 01:20:03.830
<v Speaker 6>They trust people to fly those plans where they were,</v>

2945
01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:05.660
<v Speaker 6>those planes were flown by remote control,</v>

2946
01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:06.620
<v Speaker 6>remote control.</v>

2947
01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:06.861
<v Speaker 6>Again,</v>

2948
01:20:06.861 --> 01:20:08.130
<v Speaker 6>like I come from an air force family</v>

2949
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:09.150
<v Speaker 3>that the tech,</v>

2950
01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:11.040
<v Speaker 3>what do you think all these drones are flying around.</v>

2951
01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:13.050
<v Speaker 3>That's okay.</v>

2952
01:20:13.051 --> 01:20:14.180
<v Speaker 3>And that technology has been,</v>

2953
01:20:14.181 --> 01:20:17.040
<v Speaker 3>has been extent with commercial airliners and in uh,</v>

2954
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2955
01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:20.310
<v Speaker 3>modern avionics for quite some time now.</v>

2956
01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:21.391
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

2957
01:20:21.391 --> 01:20:24.990
<v Speaker 1>are you in the school that believes that the buildings were also rigged to</v>

2958
01:20:24.991 --> 01:20:25.824
<v Speaker 1>implode?</v>

2959
01:20:26.370 --> 01:20:26.880
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

2960
01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:27.713
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2961
01:20:29.190 --> 01:20:30.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm schizophrenia on that.</v>

2962
01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:32.243
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2963
01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:36.360
<v Speaker 3>Because I don't believe the planes because the buildings to crash.</v>

2964
01:20:36.361 --> 01:20:38.070
<v Speaker 3>But what I have said throughout the course of my career,</v>

2965
01:20:38.071 --> 01:20:38.801
<v Speaker 3>I finished right.</v>

2966
01:20:38.801 --> 01:20:42.270
<v Speaker 3>And Rubicon and o four was that I wouldn't touch it because you couldn't prove</v>

2967
01:20:42.271 --> 01:20:42.840
<v Speaker 3>it in court.</v>

2968
01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:45.540
<v Speaker 3>The book that I wrote is legally admissible in court.</v>

2969
01:20:45.570 --> 01:20:46.530
<v Speaker 3>There's a chain of evidence.</v>

2970
01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:48.290
<v Speaker 3>There's no chain of evidence with the buildings.</v>

2971
01:20:48.291 --> 01:20:49.440
<v Speaker 3>You can't prove it in court.</v>

2972
01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:50.560
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2973
01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:50.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2974
01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:52.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm still that good cop on the street.</v>

2975
01:20:52.651 --> 01:20:54.900
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to see somebody ass go to jail for this.</v>

2976
01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:56.420
<v Speaker 3>So I went,</v>

2977
01:20:56.421 --> 01:20:56.951
<v Speaker 3>when I built,</v>

2978
01:20:56.951 --> 01:20:57.451
<v Speaker 3>in my case,</v>

2979
01:20:57.451 --> 01:21:00.210
<v Speaker 3>I built it from the framework of can I get this into court?</v>

2980
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:02.300
<v Speaker 3>You can't get building collapse into Corcoran's.</v>

2981
01:21:02.370 --> 01:21:06.270
<v Speaker 3>There's no chain of custody on the evidence from the day of September 11th until</v>

2982
01:21:06.271 --> 01:21:06.880
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

2983
01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:07.061
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2984
01:21:07.061 --> 01:21:10.780
<v Speaker 1>I would wonder how you would possibly prove it unless you built something just</v>

2985
01:21:10.781 --> 01:21:12.610
<v Speaker 1>like it and had the same thing happened to it.</v>

2986
01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:14.440
<v Speaker 1>How could you really prove it?</v>

2987
01:21:14.441 --> 01:21:15.930
<v Speaker 1>That's the mistake initially specked.</v>

2988
01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:16.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you,</v>

2989
01:21:16.350 --> 01:21:17.410
<v Speaker 1>if something happened like that,</v>

2990
01:21:17.411 --> 01:21:20.860
<v Speaker 1>which is an unexpected event and it caused the building to collapse,</v>

2991
01:21:20.861 --> 01:21:21.910
<v Speaker 1>it's nobody anticipated.</v>

2992
01:21:22.030 --> 01:21:25.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean that obviously there was some engineering involved in the construction of</v>

2993
01:21:25.541 --> 01:21:26.140
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

2994
01:21:26.140 --> 01:21:26.860
<v Speaker 1>those buildings.</v>

2995
01:21:26.860 --> 01:21:27.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm like serious engineering.</v>

2996
01:21:27.911 --> 01:21:30.790
<v Speaker 1>Well obviously that engineering wasn't up to par,</v>

2997
01:21:30.970 --> 01:21:32.350
<v Speaker 1>wasn't what it should've been.</v>

2998
01:21:32.650 --> 01:21:35.050
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't there be some sort of a lawsuit about that and we shouldn't,</v>

2999
01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:36.370
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't people be freaking out like,</v>

3000
01:21:36.371 --> 01:21:36.581
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3001
01:21:36.581 --> 01:21:40.270
<v Speaker 1>how come you guys built this thing to take an airplane hit and it can't take a</v>

3002
01:21:40.271 --> 01:21:41.080
<v Speaker 1>fucking airplane?</v>

3003
01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:42.310
<v Speaker 3>That's assuming that the,</v>

3004
01:21:42.311 --> 01:21:42.730
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3005
01:21:42.730 --> 01:21:46.600
<v Speaker 3>that the court system is honest too,</v>

3006
01:21:46.630 --> 01:21:47.463
<v Speaker 3>which I don't.</v>

3007
01:21:47.830 --> 01:21:48.663
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

3008
01:21:48.910 --> 01:21:49.620
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

3009
01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:50.210
<v Speaker 3>bill</v>

3010
01:21:50.210 --> 01:21:50.661
<v Speaker 1>dispute,</v>

3011
01:21:50.661 --> 01:21:54.330
<v Speaker 1>is there any other way to prove that a plane hitting a building wouldn't take</v>

3012
01:21:54.331 --> 01:21:54.440
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

3013
01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:55.273
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3014
01:21:56.020 --> 01:21:58.510
<v Speaker 3>that's what's called in the intelligence business.</v>

3015
01:21:58.511 --> 01:21:58.840
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

3016
01:21:58.840 --> 01:21:59.830
<v Speaker 3>that's called a red herring.</v>

3017
01:22:00.370 --> 01:22:04.000
<v Speaker 3>That's called an issue of the answer to which takes you completely away from the</v>

3018
01:22:04.001 --> 01:22:08.110
<v Speaker 3>fact that I proved without arguing building collapse that the u s government did</v>

3019
01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:10.060
<v Speaker 3>execute the attacks of nine 11</v>

3020
01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:11.500
<v Speaker 1>what was the number one thing,</v>

3021
01:22:11.650 --> 01:22:12.160
<v Speaker 1>if you could,</v>

3022
01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:13.090
<v Speaker 1>if you could explain it.</v>

3023
01:22:13.091 --> 01:22:16.330
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that would never believe that anybody in the position of</v>

3024
01:22:16.331 --> 01:22:18.070
<v Speaker 1>government would ever do any similar like that.</v>

3025
01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:19.450
<v Speaker 1>Anything similar to that,</v>

3026
01:22:19.690 --> 01:22:24.690
<v Speaker 1>especially anyone who was at the head of a position of power in United States of</v>

3027
01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:24.701
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

3028
01:22:24.701 --> 01:22:25.690
<v Speaker 1>the greatest country in the world.</v>

3029
01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:26.770
<v Speaker 1>So what does a number of for</v>

3030
01:22:26.770 --> 01:22:27.603
<v Speaker 3>one piece of evidence,</v>

3031
01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:27.880
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3032
01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:28.571
<v Speaker 3>This was a,</v>

3033
01:22:28.571 --> 01:22:30.520
<v Speaker 3>this was a piece of work that I did.</v>

3034
01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:31.600
<v Speaker 3>Rubicon is the,</v>

3035
01:22:31.601 --> 01:22:33.880
<v Speaker 3>I think the second or third largest selling book,</v>

3036
01:22:33.881 --> 01:22:35.200
<v Speaker 3>about nine 11 really?</v>

3037
01:22:37.690 --> 01:22:40.480
<v Speaker 3>It's been a red all over the US government can admit that I exist.</v>

3038
01:22:40.481 --> 01:22:41.320
<v Speaker 3>That's a separate story.</v>

3039
01:22:41.321 --> 01:22:42.580
<v Speaker 3>We'll get there later,</v>

3040
01:22:42.610 --> 01:22:45.760
<v Speaker 3>but my original work led me to,</v>

3041
01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:47.200
<v Speaker 3>I come from an air force family.</v>

3042
01:22:47.201 --> 01:22:49.000
<v Speaker 3>My father was a decorated aviator.</v>

3043
01:22:49.001 --> 01:22:54.001
<v Speaker 3>He was a in the 74th fighter interceptors squadron in Maine during the Korean</v>

3044
01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:54.041
<v Speaker 3>War.</v>

3045
01:22:54.041 --> 01:22:55.840
<v Speaker 3>Waiting for the Russians to come over the pole.</v>

3046
01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:57.580
<v Speaker 3>He was a radar intercept officer.</v>

3047
01:22:57.940 --> 01:23:01.200
<v Speaker 3>So I grew up being familiar with norad and scrambled procedures and,</v>

3048
01:23:01.210 --> 01:23:01.510
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3049
01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:04.030
<v Speaker 3>and how it worked when the attacks took place.</v>

3050
01:23:04.031 --> 01:23:05.050
<v Speaker 3>I saw the second plane hit,</v>

3051
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:06.370
<v Speaker 3>said something's totally wrong.</v>

3052
01:23:06.371 --> 01:23:07.300
<v Speaker 3>That could never have happened.</v>

3053
01:23:07.301 --> 01:23:09.100
<v Speaker 3>That probably would have been shot down a long time ago.</v>

3054
01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:10.990
<v Speaker 3>That that's what it was set up for.</v>

3055
01:23:10.991 --> 01:23:11.830
<v Speaker 3>But on the day,</v>

3056
01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:12.260
<v Speaker 3>how well,</v>

3057
01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:13.390
<v Speaker 3>how much time was,</v>

3058
01:23:13.391 --> 01:23:15.820
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't less than an hour between the two planes,</v>

3059
01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:17.170
<v Speaker 3>a 48 minutes,</v>

3060
01:23:17.171 --> 01:23:18.004
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

3061
01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:19.240
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3062
01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:20.040
<v Speaker 3>but on,</v>

3063
01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:20.351
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

3064
01:23:20.351 --> 01:23:21.550
<v Speaker 3>on the day of September 11th,</v>

3065
01:23:21.551 --> 01:23:21.671
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3066
01:23:21.671 --> 01:23:22.750
<v Speaker 3>you backtrack a little bit.</v>

3067
01:23:22.751 --> 01:23:24.100
<v Speaker 3>In May of 2001,</v>

3068
01:23:24.101 --> 01:23:27.940
<v Speaker 3>George Bush gave control of all war game exercises in the country to Dick</v>

3069
01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:28.773
<v Speaker 3>Cheney.</v>

3070
01:23:28.930 --> 01:23:30.400
<v Speaker 3>Never been heard of before.</v>

3071
01:23:30.401 --> 01:23:34.840
<v Speaker 3>He also good norad scrambled procedures were rewritten before the attacks of</v>

3072
01:23:34.841 --> 01:23:35.674
<v Speaker 3>nine 11.</v>

3073
01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:37.120
<v Speaker 3>But on the day of September,</v>

3074
01:23:37.121 --> 01:23:37.721
<v Speaker 3>the 11th,</v>

3075
01:23:37.721 --> 01:23:38.441
<v Speaker 3>I discovered,</v>

3076
01:23:38.441 --> 01:23:39.161
<v Speaker 3>and I have the,</v>

3077
01:23:39.161 --> 01:23:39.341
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3078
01:23:39.341 --> 01:23:40.270
<v Speaker 3>the evidence in the book,</v>

3079
01:23:40.271 --> 01:23:43.990
<v Speaker 3>including an on the record email from an air force major don areas at first air</v>

3080
01:23:43.991 --> 01:23:45.820
<v Speaker 3>force in Tyndall air force base.</v>

3081
01:23:46.810 --> 01:23:47.261
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3082
01:23:47.261 --> 01:23:47.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3083
01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:49.810
<v Speaker 3>there were war gaming exercises that were scheduled.</v>

3084
01:23:49.811 --> 01:23:52.210
<v Speaker 3>Now normally the northeast air defense sector,</v>

3085
01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:52.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3086
01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:54.520
<v Speaker 3>Angie Air National Guard pilots.</v>

3087
01:23:55.090 --> 01:23:55.923
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3088
01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.040
<v Speaker 3>there's like,</v>

3089
01:23:57.041 --> 01:23:57.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3090
01:23:57.340 --> 01:23:58.091
<v Speaker 3>50,</v>

3091
01:23:58.091 --> 01:24:00.820
<v Speaker 3>60 planes available in all the states and needs.</v>

3092
01:24:00.910 --> 01:24:01.720
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3093
01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:01.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3094
01:24:01.990 --> 01:24:05.470
<v Speaker 3>but there were war game exercise is the Dick Cheney has scheduled that sent like</v>

3095
01:24:05.471 --> 01:24:09.370
<v Speaker 3>80% of the fighters from northeast air defense sector to Alaska,</v>

3096
01:24:09.670 --> 01:24:14.560
<v Speaker 3>Canada and Greenland for war game exercises on the day of September 11th,</v>

3097
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:16.150
<v Speaker 3>a vigilant Guardian,</v>

3098
01:24:16.151 --> 01:24:16.961
<v Speaker 3>vigilant warrior,</v>

3099
01:24:16.961 --> 01:24:17.794
<v Speaker 3>northern.</v>

3100
01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:19.990
<v Speaker 3>They're all in the book and I have the records of all of them.</v>

3101
01:24:20.270 --> 01:24:21.370
<v Speaker 3>Who made that call?</v>

3102
01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:22.180
<v Speaker 3>Dick Cheney.</v>

3103
01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:23.020
<v Speaker 3>Dick Cheney made the,</v>

3104
01:24:23.050 --> 01:24:23.321
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3105
01:24:23.321 --> 01:24:24.700
<v Speaker 3>so now you have no fighters.</v>

3106
01:24:24.701 --> 01:24:27.520
<v Speaker 3>But then there was one war game exercise,</v>

3107
01:24:28.450 --> 01:24:29.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3108
01:24:29.170 --> 01:24:30.100
<v Speaker 3>vigilant Guardian,</v>

3109
01:24:30.101 --> 01:24:35.101
<v Speaker 3>I believe it was that injected 24 false radar blips onto the screens of the</v>

3110
01:24:35.111 --> 01:24:38.200
<v Speaker 3>northeast air defense sector as the hijackings took place.</v>

3111
01:24:39.250 --> 01:24:42.370
<v Speaker 3>Now picture you're an air traffic controller looking at your screen,</v>

3112
01:24:42.371 --> 01:24:43.090
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3113
01:24:43.090 --> 01:24:44.290
<v Speaker 3>You got to hijack alert,</v>

3114
01:24:44.291 --> 01:24:44.621
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

3115
01:24:44.621 --> 01:24:48.160
<v Speaker 3>And then you got this war game exercise and you cannot pick the High Jack Out of</v>

3116
01:24:48.161 --> 01:24:52.890
<v Speaker 3>the 24 false blips and now you've only got eight fighters left in the north at</v>

3117
01:24:52.910 --> 01:24:54.190
<v Speaker 3>northeast air defense sector.</v>

3118
01:24:54.191 --> 01:24:55.450
<v Speaker 3>They have to fly in pairs.</v>

3119
01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:56.440
<v Speaker 3>You got to have a wing man.</v>

3120
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:57.340
<v Speaker 3>How traumatic.</v>

3121
01:24:57.341 --> 01:24:57.760
<v Speaker 3>Distinct.</v>

3122
01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:58.593
<v Speaker 3>So you couldn't,</v>

3123
01:24:59.190 --> 01:24:59.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

3124
01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:00.593
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3125
01:25:00.850 --> 01:25:03.430
<v Speaker 3>So that's how I piece it together.</v>

3126
01:25:03.431 --> 01:25:04.091
<v Speaker 3>How it was done.</v>

3127
01:25:04.091 --> 01:25:06.560
<v Speaker 3>The planes were easily flown by remote control.</v>

3128
01:25:06.730 --> 01:25:07.810
<v Speaker 3>I believe in New York City,</v>

3129
01:25:07.811 --> 01:25:11.200
<v Speaker 3>the remote control was operated out of WTC seven which is why they had to</v>

3130
01:25:11.201 --> 01:25:12.490
<v Speaker 3>destroy WTC seven</v>

3131
01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:16.340
<v Speaker 6>well they had already had remote control planes in the 60s fifties yeah.</v>

3132
01:25:16.350 --> 01:25:18.160
<v Speaker 6>But how would you explain like the stewardess,</v>

3133
01:25:18.161 --> 01:25:19.570
<v Speaker 6>how would you explain all the people on it?</v>

3134
01:25:19.571 --> 01:25:21.120
<v Speaker 6>Cause I mean I doubt like if,</v>

3135
01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:23.890
<v Speaker 6>if the stewards were like getting the plane ready and they open up the cockpit</v>

3136
01:25:23.891 --> 01:25:25.360
<v Speaker 6>and Teddy Ruxpin was sitting there to be like,</v>

3137
01:25:25.361 --> 01:25:25.571
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

3138
01:25:25.571 --> 01:25:29.050
<v Speaker 6>what the way you do it is the pilot's no longer have control of the plane.</v>

3139
01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:29.913
<v Speaker 6>That's right.</v>

3140
01:25:30.130 --> 01:25:31.390
<v Speaker 6>The pilots are in the plane.</v>

3141
01:25:31.391 --> 01:25:34.540
<v Speaker 6>They started to take off and then they switch it off by remote control,</v>

3142
01:25:34.541 --> 01:25:37.270
<v Speaker 6>the thing by computer and then they're fucked.</v>

3143
01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:39.730
<v Speaker 6>That these people are good for uh,</v>

3144
01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:43.510
<v Speaker 6>for a couple of decades were proposing that was part of operation Northwoods.</v>

3145
01:25:43.511 --> 01:25:46.990
<v Speaker 6>They're proposing doing that to blow up a jet airliner and blame it on the</v>

3146
01:25:46.991 --> 01:25:47.824
<v Speaker 6>Cubans.</v>

3147
01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:50.140
<v Speaker 6>They were going to say a whole bunch of people died and they were just going to</v>

3148
01:25:50.141 --> 01:25:50.974
<v Speaker 6>relocate people</v>

3149
01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:54.010
<v Speaker 3>and then going back to my family history,</v>

3150
01:25:54.011 --> 01:25:55.870
<v Speaker 3>my mother worked in the most secret section of,</v>

3151
01:25:55.871 --> 01:25:57.250
<v Speaker 3>of a army security agency.</v>

3152
01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:58.180
<v Speaker 3>The Japanese codes.</v>

3153
01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:01.930
<v Speaker 3>We had broken the Japanese Coats and Roosevelt knew the Japanese were going to</v>

3154
01:26:01.931 --> 01:26:03.320
<v Speaker 3>attack and let it happen.</v>

3155
01:26:03.490 --> 01:26:07.200
<v Speaker 6>I was dating a girl who was working in the White House is a,</v>

3156
01:26:07.210 --> 01:26:09.390
<v Speaker 6>I dated her a long time ago and she,</v>

3157
01:26:09.391 --> 01:26:10.224
<v Speaker 6>she worked,</v>

3158
01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:14.010
<v Speaker 6>she had something to do with a navy intelligence or something like that.</v>

3159
01:26:14.011 --> 01:26:14.844
<v Speaker 6>I forget what it was,</v>

3160
01:26:14.890 --> 01:26:17.850
<v Speaker 6>but she entered something into a computer.</v>

3161
01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:20.440
<v Speaker 6>She uses some sort of a code word that she wasn't supposed to use.</v>

3162
01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:21.870
<v Speaker 6>She brought Chai,</v>

3163
01:26:21.890 --> 01:26:24.640
<v Speaker 6>typed in little green men under some sort of a data search.</v>

3164
01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:25.773
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

3165
01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:27.640
<v Speaker 6>all these people came to her and they sat her down.</v>

3166
01:26:27.641 --> 01:26:30.610
<v Speaker 6>They brought her to her room and asked her what the fuck she was doing.</v>

3167
01:26:30.611 --> 01:26:33.430
<v Speaker 6>And while she was looking into that and really spoke to her,</v>

3168
01:26:33.650 --> 01:26:33.820
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3169
01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:34.810
<v Speaker 6>she did it as a joke.</v>

3170
01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:36.040
<v Speaker 6>I just thought you'd be silly.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I mean it's,</v>

3186

<v Speaker 6>it's amazing that,</v>

3187
01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:51.681
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3188
01:26:51.681 --> 01:26:54.110

<v Speaker 6>you feel like that's a real goddamn president.</v>

3192
01:26:58.520 --> 01:26:59.450
<v Speaker 6>That's the president.</v>

3193
01:26:59.451 --> 01:27:04.451
<v Speaker 6>That's the commander in chief looking at the people with leadership and trying</v>

3194
01:27:04.491 --> 01:27:05.720
<v Speaker 6>to move us forward.</v>

3195
01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:06.890
<v Speaker 6>And that that was a guy.</v>

3196
01:27:06.891 --> 01:27:07.160
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3199
01:27:07.791 --> 01:27:08.091
<v Speaker 6>when,</v>

3200
01:27:08.091 --> 01:27:11.990
<v Speaker 6>when he left and he started talking about the military industrial complex and</v>

3201
01:27:11.991 --> 01:27:13.970
<v Speaker 6>warning people about the dangers.</v>

3202
01:27:14.150 --> 01:27:14.360
<v Speaker 6>We,</v>

3203
01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:16.400
<v Speaker 6>could you imagine a speech like that today?</v>

3204
01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:16.730
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

3205
01:27:16.730 --> 01:27:18.140
<v Speaker 6>Everyone's bought and paid for.</v>

3206
01:27:18.170 --> 01:27:19.130
<v Speaker 6>No one would ever do that.</v>

3207
01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:23.620
<v Speaker 3>Did the United States of America was mortally wounded on,</v>

3208
01:27:23.621 --> 01:27:25.870
<v Speaker 3>on November 22nd,</v>

3209
01:27:25.870 --> 01:27:26.350
<v Speaker 3>1963.</v>

3210
01:27:26.350 --> 01:27:30.310
<v Speaker 3>But the coup de Gras was administered with the assassination of Martin Luther</v>

3211
01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:32.800
<v Speaker 3>King and Bobby Kennedy in 1968 and I was alive then.</v>

3212
01:27:33.310 --> 01:27:34.051
<v Speaker 3>And I have some,</v>

3213
01:27:34.051 --> 01:27:34.884
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3214
01:27:34.990 --> 01:27:38.890
<v Speaker 3>some connections to Bobby Kennedy as a result of my CIA stuff.</v>

3215
01:27:38.891 --> 01:27:40.180
<v Speaker 3>I was only a sophomore in high school,</v>

3216
01:27:40.181 --> 01:27:42.130
<v Speaker 3>but LAPD handled that.</v>

3217
01:27:42.131 --> 01:27:45.430
<v Speaker 3>And I was groomed by the same people in Lapd who had done the Bobby Kennedy</v>

3218
01:27:45.431 --> 01:27:45.611
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

3219
01:27:45.611 --> 01:27:47.680
<v Speaker 3>And Sirhan Sirhan did not shoot Bobby Kennedy.</v>

3220
01:27:47.681 --> 01:27:48.161
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

3221
01:27:48.161 --> 01:27:48.730
<v Speaker 3>He didn't,</v>

3222
01:27:48.730 --> 01:27:50.470
<v Speaker 3>that was a CIA hit from start to finish.</v>

3223
01:27:50.530 --> 01:27:51.700
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

3224
01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:55.150
<v Speaker 3>So Sirhan Sirhan was just what a set up a patsy.</v>

3225
01:27:55.151 --> 01:27:56.680
<v Speaker 3>He was over stones.</v>

3226
01:27:57.210 --> 01:27:58.130
<v Speaker 3>He was hip,</v>

3227
01:27:58.140 --> 01:27:58.973
<v Speaker 3>no program.</v>

3228
01:27:59.320 --> 01:27:59.940
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3229
01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:01.320
<v Speaker 3>they were very heavy into,</v>

3230
01:28:01.340 --> 01:28:03.510
<v Speaker 3>into research with LSD and,</v>

3231
01:28:03.511 --> 01:28:04.390
<v Speaker 3>and hypnosis,</v>

3232
01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:05.230
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3233
01:28:05.230 --> 01:28:06.160
<v Speaker 3>to produce.</v>

3234
01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:06.910
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3235
01:28:06.910 --> 01:28:09.370
<v Speaker 3>so they talked him into it somehow or another it was LSD.</v>

3236
01:28:09.580 --> 01:28:10.413
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3237
01:28:10.650 --> 01:28:11.550
<v Speaker 6>there were that good at that.</v>

3238
01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:11.980
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3241
01:28:12.301 --> 01:28:14.470
<v Speaker 6>he wasn't blow a fuse and just stuck shooting everyday.</v>

3242
01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:16.810
<v Speaker 3>It's true psychological butchery,</v>

3243
01:28:17.010 --> 01:28:17.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3244

3245
01:28:17.850 --> 01:28:20.740
<v Speaker 3>there are records still existing from the LAPD files.</v>

3246
01:28:20.741 --> 01:28:21.574
<v Speaker 3>I have some,</v>

3247
01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:22.913
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3248
01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:25.560
<v Speaker 3>showing the kind of stuff.</v>

3249
01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:27.620
<v Speaker 3>He had lots of drawings and script,</v>

3250
01:28:27.621 --> 01:28:28.780
<v Speaker 3>so they planted ideas,</v>

3251
01:28:28.781 --> 01:28:32.160
<v Speaker 3>but they planted in him a hypnotic trigger and that was a one.</v>

3252
01:28:32.310 --> 01:28:33.610
<v Speaker 6>What's the Manchurian candidate?</v>

3253
01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:34.240
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

3255
01:28:34.810 --> 01:28:35.420
<v Speaker 6>They can really do.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>

3257
01:28:37.390 --> 01:28:38.410
<v Speaker 6>It's super effective.</v>

3258
01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:40.960
<v Speaker 6>They can just count on it and go kill a guy was running for president,</v>

3259
01:28:40.990 --> 01:28:43.000
<v Speaker 6>you would think you wouldn't want some more on that.</v>

3260
01:28:43.330 --> 01:28:44.090
<v Speaker 3>They murdered,</v>

3261

01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:53.900
<v Speaker 3>This train's death of Vince foster is a great one.</v>

3295
01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:40.313
<v Speaker 5>Dick Cheney,</v>

3296
01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:41.080
<v Speaker 5>he could do it.</v>

3297
01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:41.311

3302
01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:47.160
<v Speaker 5>I was burned on bill forever.</v>

3303
01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:49.200
<v Speaker 5>He's a drug dealer and murder and son of a bitch.</v>

3304
01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:49.441
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3305
01:29:49.441 --> 01:29:50.190
<v Speaker 5>that's so scary.</v>

3306
01:29:50.190 --> 01:29:53.400
<v Speaker 5>Arkansas is the only state ever in the history of the United States.</v>

3307
01:29:53.401 --> 01:29:53.790
<v Speaker 5>That was,</v>

3308
01:29:53.790 --> 01:29:57.750
<v Speaker 5>that had bearer bonds cause it was laundering so much cocaine money.</v>

3309
01:29:58.320 --> 01:29:58.920
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3310
01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:01.080
<v Speaker 5>What is a bearer bonds bearer bonds.</v>

3311
01:30:01.081 --> 01:30:01.531
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>

3312
01:30:01.531 --> 01:30:01.980
<v Speaker 5>bonds.</v>

3313
01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:05.610
<v Speaker 5>They're bonds that you can walk into any large bank in the world and redeem</v>

3314
01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:06.690
<v Speaker 5>right there for cash.</v>

3315
01:30:07.050 --> 01:30:07.883
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

3316
01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:09.211
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

3317
01:30:09.211 --> 01:30:09.830
<v Speaker 5>So they just submit,</v>

3318
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:12.510
<v Speaker 5>they let that be legals because they were trying to get rid of all the cocaine.</v>

3319
01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:15.690
<v Speaker 5>Everybody was on the same side.</v>

3320
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:17.210
<v Speaker 5>That's an amazing story for folks who,</v>

3321
01:30:17.220 --> 01:30:18.270
<v Speaker 5>there was a documentary on it.</v>

3322
01:30:18.271 --> 01:30:19.051
<v Speaker 5>Forget the documentary,</v>

3323
01:30:19.051 --> 01:30:21.510
<v Speaker 5>I believe it was an a and one of those a and e shows Barry seal's,</v>

3324
01:30:21.540 --> 01:30:22.560
<v Speaker 5>Mena Arkansas.</v>

3325
01:30:22.650 --> 01:30:23.550
<v Speaker 5>Amazing story.</v>

3326
01:30:24.030 --> 01:30:26.610
<v Speaker 5>And that guy became the president and we think he's like one of the best ones</v>

3327
01:30:26.611 --> 01:30:27.000
<v Speaker 5>ever.</v>

3328
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:27.833
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3329
01:30:28.140 --> 01:30:29.340
<v Speaker 5>everybody wants to bring them back.</v>

3330
01:30:29.341 --> 01:30:30.480
<v Speaker 5>This is a really funny story.</v>

3331
01:30:30.481 --> 01:30:30.781
<v Speaker 5>One of the,</v>

3332
01:30:30.781 --> 01:30:31.561
<v Speaker 5>one of the first stories,</v>

3333
01:30:31.561 --> 01:30:32.970
<v Speaker 5>I broke it from the wilderness and I,</v>

3334
01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:35.310
<v Speaker 5>and that was a newsletter I had for eight and a half years.</v>

3335
01:30:35.311 --> 01:30:35.540
<v Speaker 5>We've,</v>

3336
01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:36.000
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3337
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.570
<v Speaker 5>our final coup was a breaking the Pat Tillman cover up.</v>

3338
01:30:40.130 --> 01:30:40.350
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3339
01:30:40.350 --> 01:30:42.360
<v Speaker 5>my computer's got smashed for that and I got poisoned.</v>

3340
01:30:42.361 --> 01:30:44.100
<v Speaker 5>But one of the early stories we broke,</v>

3341
01:30:44.101 --> 01:30:49.070
<v Speaker 5>Barry seal used to own a Beechcraft king air 200 so really cool play turbocharge</v>

3342
01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:49.831
<v Speaker 5>two engines,</v>

3343
01:30:49.831 --> 01:30:50.071
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3344
01:30:50.071 --> 01:30:51.780
<v Speaker 5>high t tail pressurized.</v>

3345
01:30:51.781 --> 01:30:51.911
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

3346
01:30:51.911 --> 01:30:52.091
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3347
01:30:52.091 --> 01:30:52.320
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3348
01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:54.340
<v Speaker 5>it's a Rolls Royce plan and,</v>

3349
01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:59.400
<v Speaker 5>and so I got a tip and the same plane that Barry seal owned was George W.</v>

3350
01:31:00.490 --> 01:31:03.570
<v Speaker 5>Bush has playing Texas state plane when he was governor.</v>

3351
01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:07.140
<v Speaker 5>He was using as governor Barry Seal's airplane.</v>

3352
01:31:07.141 --> 01:31:08.580
<v Speaker 5>And I broke the story in AP,</v>

3353
01:31:08.581 --> 01:31:09.780
<v Speaker 5>came and picked it up from me.</v>

3354
01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:11.580
<v Speaker 5>Holy shaders pick it up.</v>

3355
01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:12.630
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3356
01:31:12.630 --> 01:31:14.820
<v Speaker 5>didn't that happen really recently as well?</v>

3357
01:31:14.821 --> 01:31:19.821
<v Speaker 5>Like a CIA jet that had been to Guantanamo Bay at least twice crashed in Mexico</v>

3358
01:31:21.091 --> 01:31:22.920
<v Speaker 5>with four tons of cocaine in it.</v>

3359
01:31:23.010 --> 01:31:23.590
<v Speaker 5>We had a story.</v>

3360
01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:24.423
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3361
01:31:24.550 --> 01:31:25.381
<v Speaker 5>That was a true story,</v>

3362
01:31:25.381 --> 01:31:25.670
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3363
01:31:25.670 --> 01:31:27.870
<v Speaker 5>That that goes back to Air America back to,</v>

3364
01:31:27.871 --> 01:31:28.410
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3365
01:31:28.410 --> 01:31:31.210
<v Speaker 5>the old flying tigers in the Chenaults and the Coleman Tang.</v>

3366
01:31:31.330 --> 01:31:32.490
<v Speaker 5>Nobody wants to believe this.</v>

3367
01:31:33.090 --> 01:31:34.130
<v Speaker 5>What you're saying right now.</v>

3368
01:31:34.140 --> 01:31:35.430
<v Speaker 5>Now anybody who believes it now,</v>

3369
01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:36.181
<v Speaker 5>everybody now,</v>

3370
01:31:36.181 --> 01:31:37.650
<v Speaker 5>but there's a lot of people out there,</v>

3371
01:31:37.710 --> 01:31:41.280
<v Speaker 5>especially folks that I'm like maybe in their 50s that have had like a normal</v>

3372
01:31:41.281 --> 01:31:42.570
<v Speaker 5>job and you know,</v>

3373
01:31:42.571 --> 01:31:45.000
<v Speaker 5>go to barbecues on the weekends and they'd go to church.</v>

3374
01:31:45.030 --> 01:31:47.340
<v Speaker 5>They don't ever want to like think too far outside the box.</v>

3375
01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:50.460
<v Speaker 5>What you're saying is so fucking far outside the box,</v>

3376
01:31:50.590 --> 01:31:51.810
<v Speaker 5>but there's a lot of people that are going,</v>

3377
01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:52.500
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3378
01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:52.921
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3379
01:31:52.921 --> 01:31:53.161
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3380
01:31:53.161 --> 01:31:53.401
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3381
01:31:53.401 --> 01:31:53.600
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

3382
01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:54.840
<v Speaker 5>You're taking it too far.</v>

3383
01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:55.591
<v Speaker 5>He didn't,</v>

3384
01:31:55.591 --> 01:31:56.730
<v Speaker 5>they didn't cause nine one,</v>

3385
01:31:56.731 --> 01:31:57.870
<v Speaker 5>one proofs all there.</v>

3386
01:31:58.050 --> 01:31:58.950
<v Speaker 5>What do you think is the,</v>

3387
01:31:59.230 --> 01:31:59.980
<v Speaker 5>what's the number one</v>

3388
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:02.830
<v Speaker 1>piece of proof to you that Dick Cheney caused that to happen?</v>

3389
01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:04.060
<v Speaker 1>So the organs,</v>

3390
01:32:04.061 --> 01:32:07.000
<v Speaker 1>they were all under his control because the fact it couldn't have been</v>

3391
01:32:07.001 --> 01:32:07.631
<v Speaker 1>coincidental,</v>

3392
01:32:07.631 --> 01:32:08.464
<v Speaker 1>it couldn't have been,</v>

3393
01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:10.960
<v Speaker 1>that may be someone knew that he was doing these war games.</v>

3394
01:32:10.961 --> 01:32:14.020
<v Speaker 1>So they figured that's a time to attack because you know when they had some</v>

3395
01:32:14.021 --> 01:32:17.260
<v Speaker 1>inside people in the army that he knew of this and then they leaked the</v>

3396
01:32:17.261 --> 01:32:18.430
<v Speaker 1>information and they said,</v>

3397
01:32:18.431 --> 01:32:19.660
<v Speaker 1>well we'll get you another week.</v>

3398
01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:21.040
<v Speaker 1>Do you read against possible?</v>

3399
01:32:21.430 --> 01:32:24.340
<v Speaker 1>Did you just listen to what you were explaining and how like not credible?</v>

3400
01:32:24.341 --> 01:32:25.000
<v Speaker 1>That sounded.</v>

3401
01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:25.780
<v Speaker 1>It sounds ridiculous,</v>

3402
01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:26.081
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

3403
01:32:26.081 --> 01:32:26.531
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

3404
01:32:26.531 --> 01:32:26.861
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

3405
01:32:26.861 --> 01:32:30.120
<v Speaker 1>But I'm just giving you a what f because I watch mission impossible five the</v>

3406
01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:30.750
<v Speaker 1>other night.</v>

3407
01:32:30.750 --> 01:32:31.301
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3408
01:32:31.301 --> 01:32:32.800
<v Speaker 1>Pretty bad ass up to the end,</v>

3409
01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:35.080
<v Speaker 1>but I'm willing to suspend disbelief,</v>

3410
01:32:35.081 --> 01:32:35.650
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

3411
01:32:35.650 --> 01:32:35.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3412
01:32:35.841 --> 01:32:36.310
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

3413
01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:36.721
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>

3414
01:32:36.721 --> 01:32:37.810
<v Speaker 1>is it possible that,</v>

3415
01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:38.980
<v Speaker 1>that that happened or no,</v>

3416
01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:40.170
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3417
01:32:40.170 --> 01:32:40.740
<v Speaker 3>no way.</v>

3418
01:32:40.740 --> 01:32:41.573
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3419
01:32:41.670 --> 01:32:42.180
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>

3420
01:32:42.180 --> 01:32:44.610
<v Speaker 3>You had of the 19 hijackers,</v>

3421
01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:45.473
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3422
01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:47.670
<v Speaker 3>I think we know that five had,</v>

3423
01:32:47.671 --> 01:32:47.880
<v Speaker 3>had,</v>

3424
01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:50.490
<v Speaker 3>had received training at US military basis.</v>

3425
01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:51.330
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3426
01:32:51.330 --> 01:32:54.570
<v Speaker 3>Mohammed Odd Dot Gunter Annex to Maxwell Air Force Base.</v>

3427
01:32:54.571 --> 01:32:56.070
<v Speaker 3>And I have all of that in there.</v>

3428
01:32:56.660 --> 01:32:57.381
<v Speaker 1>But hold on a second.</v>

3429
01:32:57.381 --> 01:33:00.980
<v Speaker 1>If you think that the planes were taken over remote control,</v>

3430
01:33:01.310 --> 01:33:03.260
<v Speaker 1>do you think that people were,</v>

3431
01:33:03.580 --> 01:33:06.920
<v Speaker 1>the hijackers were actually really on the planes and attack,</v>

3432
01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:07.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3433
01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:09.420
<v Speaker 3>The hijackers were on the planes,</v>

3434
01:33:09.421 --> 01:33:10.230
<v Speaker 3>but they weren't,</v>

3435
01:33:10.230 --> 01:33:11.920
<v Speaker 3>they didn't know or they didn't know.</v>

3436
01:33:12.230 --> 01:33:16.500
<v Speaker 3>There were 12 I call Patsy's who were like sacrificial hijackers.</v>

3437
01:33:16.501 --> 01:33:17.880
<v Speaker 3>They were never meant to live anyway.</v>

3438
01:33:17.881 --> 01:33:18.870
<v Speaker 3>They were on the plains,</v>

3439
01:33:18.871 --> 01:33:21.540
<v Speaker 3>definitely planes were flown by remote control because,</v>

3440
01:33:21.990 --> 01:33:22.411
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3441
01:33:22.411 --> 01:33:22.681
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3442
01:33:22.681 --> 01:33:23.251
<v Speaker 3>pilots like,</v>

3443
01:33:23.251 --> 01:33:24.084
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3444
01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:24.520
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

3445
01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:24.991
<v Speaker 3>how's me?</v>

3446
01:33:24.991 --> 01:33:25.801
<v Speaker 3>Or I'll meet our,</v>

3447
01:33:25.801 --> 01:33:27.690
<v Speaker 3>whoever was supposedly flying the,</v>

3448
01:33:28.100 --> 01:33:28.460
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3449
01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:28.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3450
01:33:28.700 --> 01:33:30.990
<v Speaker 3>the plane of the seven into the Pentagon,</v>

3451
01:33:32.130 --> 01:33:32.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3452
01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:32.860
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>

3453
01:33:32.860 --> 01:33:33.750
<v Speaker 3>that's a maneuver.</v>

3454
01:33:33.751 --> 01:33:36.180
<v Speaker 3>Like one of the most experienced pilots in the world couldn't make,</v>

3455
01:33:36.181 --> 01:33:38.920
<v Speaker 3>and this was a guy who couldn't get a multi-engine license.</v>

3456
01:33:38.921 --> 01:33:40.290
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't get an instrument rating.</v>

3457
01:33:40.291 --> 01:33:41.190
<v Speaker 3>He had no hours.</v>

3458
01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:42.840
<v Speaker 3>It's not possibly be,</v>

3459
01:33:43.020 --> 01:33:46.530
<v Speaker 3>none of those maneuvers could have been performed by any of those people.</v>

3460
01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:47.540
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3461
01:33:47.540 --> 01:33:48.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3462
01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:48.791
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3463
01:33:48.791 --> 01:33:52.950
<v Speaker 3>and I hold some question as to whether Mohammed auto and several of the ones</v>

3464
01:33:52.951 --> 01:33:55.020
<v Speaker 3>that I and Michelle,</v>

3465
01:33:55.021 --> 01:33:57.900
<v Speaker 3>Chelsea Dusky and some great work was done,</v>

3466
01:33:58.320 --> 01:33:58.651
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3467
01:33:58.651 --> 01:33:59.640
<v Speaker 3>on the flight training,</v>

3468
01:33:59.670 --> 01:33:59.850
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3469
01:33:59.850 --> 01:34:01.500
<v Speaker 3>by Daniel hop sicker.</v>

3470
01:34:01.650 --> 01:34:03.180
<v Speaker 3>I've seen early stuff hop sick,</v>

3471
01:34:03.420 --> 01:34:08.420
<v Speaker 3>did amazing work about the Venice Flying School and Mohammed autos flying circus</v>

3472
01:34:09.091 --> 01:34:11.640
<v Speaker 3>and all real hard documentation.</v>

3473
01:34:12.030 --> 01:34:14.580
<v Speaker 3>So I wasn't alone with me and Michelle Chester Dusky,</v>

3474
01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:15.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3475
01:34:15.570 --> 01:34:17.220
<v Speaker 3>Dan hop sicker and Paul Thompson,</v>

3476
01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:18.211
<v Speaker 3>Thompson,</v>

3477
01:34:18.211 --> 01:34:18.391
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

3478
01:34:18.391 --> 01:34:21.540
<v Speaker 3>we were the four guys who really did 90% of the nine 11.</v>

3479
01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:25.830
<v Speaker 1>Enlighten me about the argument when it comes to the physics of actually</v>

3480
01:34:25.831 --> 01:34:26.700
<v Speaker 1>following a plane.</v>

3481
01:34:26.701 --> 01:34:30.660
<v Speaker 1>That what I had read that it's much more difficult to do,</v>

3482
01:34:30.661 --> 01:34:34.410
<v Speaker 1>like physically difficult to do what they're doing by steering it than it is to</v>

3483
01:34:34.411 --> 01:34:34.981
<v Speaker 1>do it by remote.</v>

3484
01:34:34.981 --> 01:34:35.814
<v Speaker 1>Well control</v>

3485
01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:36.701
<v Speaker 3>what they were doing.</v>

3486
01:34:36.701 --> 01:34:40.210
<v Speaker 3>It's physically hard to do because of the g force of the turn and everything.</v>

3487
01:34:40.330 --> 01:34:40.601
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3488
01:34:40.601 --> 01:34:44.900
<v Speaker 3>and it's also the calculation that you have to understand it when you're flying</v>

3489
01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:45.791
<v Speaker 3>a seven,</v>

3490
01:34:45.791 --> 01:34:46.001
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

3491
01:34:46.001 --> 01:34:46.271
<v Speaker 3>seven,</v>

3492
01:34:46.271 --> 01:34:46.381
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>

3493
01:34:46.381 --> 01:34:46.601
<v Speaker 3>seven,</v>

3494
01:34:46.601 --> 01:34:46.841
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>

3495
01:34:46.841 --> 01:34:47.221
<v Speaker 3>seven,</v>

3496
01:34:47.221 --> 01:34:51.580
<v Speaker 3>eight and you're coming out of a turn on onto the north tower,</v>

3497
01:34:51.660 --> 01:34:51.940
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3498
01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:53.560
<v Speaker 3>You got to know what the fuck you're doing.</v>

3499
01:34:53.561 --> 01:34:55.570
<v Speaker 3>You gotta be good at that Shit.</v>

3500
01:34:56.110 --> 01:34:59.780
<v Speaker 3>That's like a formula race driver driving through a chicane,</v>

3501
01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:01.100
<v Speaker 3>holding the perfect line.</v>

3502
01:35:01.130 --> 01:35:01.491
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3503
01:35:01.491 --> 01:35:02.271
<v Speaker 6>I was thinking that too.</v>

3504
01:35:02.271 --> 01:35:02.691
<v Speaker 6>Like what's the,</v>

3505
01:35:02.691 --> 01:35:04.760
<v Speaker 6>keep that fucking plane from spinning upside down.</v>

3506
01:35:04.761 --> 01:35:07.820
<v Speaker 6>Now this asshole is spinning it around in a circle like that.</v>

3507
01:35:07.821 --> 01:35:09.140
<v Speaker 6>Well he knows how to do that with a jet.</v>

3508
01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:09.620
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3509
01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:11.000
<v Speaker 6>a giant jumbo jet.</v>

3510
01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:12.440
<v Speaker 6>These guys couldn't fly.</v>

3511
01:35:12.590 --> 01:35:14.900
<v Speaker 6>They weren't licensed to fly a regular old Cessna.</v>

3512
01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:16.730
<v Speaker 6>So how many people know about it?</v>

3513
01:35:16.731 --> 01:35:17.211
<v Speaker 6>All together.</v>

3514
01:35:17.211 --> 01:35:18.260
<v Speaker 6>If you had to guess,</v>

3515
01:35:18.261 --> 01:35:18.681
<v Speaker 6>if you said,</v>

3516
01:35:18.681 --> 01:35:18.951
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

3517
01:35:18.951 --> 01:35:20.390
<v Speaker 6>there's Dick Cheney and he's,</v>

3518
01:35:20.391 --> 01:35:24.140
<v Speaker 6>he's the guy that you perceive as being the mastermind and then there's a bunch</v>

3519
01:35:24.141 --> 01:35:28.250
<v Speaker 6>of people also have to be in on it because they have to rig these planes with</v>

3520
01:35:28.251 --> 01:35:30.450
<v Speaker 6>remote control capability and they have to,</v>

3521
01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:31.303
<v Speaker 6>that's already there.</v>

3522
01:35:31.310 --> 01:35:33.380
<v Speaker 6>Order NATO to stand down.</v>

3523
01:35:33.381 --> 01:35:33.591
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3524
01:35:33.591 --> 01:35:34.041
<v Speaker 6>they have to,</v>

3525
01:35:34.041 --> 01:35:36.050
<v Speaker 6>they have to do all these different things that they did that day.</v>

3526
01:35:36.051 --> 01:35:36.520
<v Speaker 6>How many,</v>

3527
01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:37.353
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3528
01:35:37.630 --> 01:35:39.310
<v Speaker 3>it's compartmentalized intelligence.</v>

3529
01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:41.260
<v Speaker 3>Now remember I come from a spoke family.</v>

3530
01:35:41.261 --> 01:35:43.750
<v Speaker 3>So let's say you're making an atom bomb,</v>

3531
01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:44.170
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3532
01:35:44.170 --> 01:35:45.850
<v Speaker 3>So some guy in Oak Ridge,</v>

3533
01:35:45.851 --> 01:35:48.400
<v Speaker 3>Tennessee might be doing something to enrich uranium.</v>

3534
01:35:48.670 --> 01:35:53.670
<v Speaker 3>Some guy someplace else might be making part of a super hard steel casing to</v>

3535
01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:56.980
<v Speaker 3>contain the blast for one of the bombs.</v>

3536
01:35:57.130 --> 01:35:58.480
<v Speaker 3>Somebody else may be working on it.</v>

3537
01:35:58.690 --> 01:36:00.970
<v Speaker 3>Nobody knows what the finished product looks like,</v>

3538
01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:01.953
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3539
01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:04.090
<v Speaker 3>That has to be a few at the top.</v>

3540
01:36:04.091 --> 01:36:05.140
<v Speaker 3>How many people do you think?</v>

3541
01:36:05.150 --> 01:36:05.983
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3542
01:36:07.030 --> 01:36:11.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm guessing a 30 40 50</v>

3543
01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:12.910
<v Speaker 6>that's terrifying.</v>

3544
01:36:13.630 --> 01:36:16.900
<v Speaker 6>It's terrifying that 40 or 50 people would be willing to do that and that they</v>

3545
01:36:16.901 --> 01:36:19.720
<v Speaker 6>could all find each other and form a gang and you know,</v>

3546
01:36:19.721 --> 01:36:19.821
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

3547
01:36:19.821 --> 01:36:23.290
<v Speaker 6>and actually make something like this happen and they just hang out at NASA all</v>

3548
01:36:23.291 --> 01:36:24.124
<v Speaker 6>the time.</v>

3549
01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:25.680
<v Speaker 6>Not Nasa or,</v>

3550
01:36:25.690 --> 01:36:26.380
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3551
01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:28.510
<v Speaker 6>some Army Pentagon type place.</v>

3552
01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:30.730
<v Speaker 6>Now I'm soundstage.</v>

3553
01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:34.810
<v Speaker 6>Do you think that the thing that hit the Pentagon was a jet or are you okay?</v>

3554
01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:35.880
<v Speaker 3>Was it a missile?</v>

3555
01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:36.110
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3556
01:36:36.110 --> 01:36:36.450
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

3557
01:36:36.450 --> 01:36:37.283
<v Speaker 3>it was an airplane.</v>

3558
01:36:37.470 --> 01:36:38.200
<v Speaker 3>It was an airport.</v>

3559
01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:38.530
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3560
01:36:38.530 --> 01:36:39.300
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

3561
01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:40.000
<v Speaker 3>I was a cop.</v>

3562
01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:40.220
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

3563
01:36:40.220 --> 01:36:40.510
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3564
01:36:40.510 --> 01:36:43.480
<v Speaker 3>And so what I was another remote control airplane,</v>

3565
01:36:43.481 --> 01:36:43.830
<v Speaker 3>you believe?</v>

3566
01:36:43.830 --> 01:36:44.440
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3567
01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:44.850
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3568
01:36:44.850 --> 01:36:45.250
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

3569
01:36:45.250 --> 01:36:46.083
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>

3570
01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:48.100
<v Speaker 3>That's why I was able to do something so crazy.</v>

3571
01:36:49.020 --> 01:36:52.390
<v Speaker 3>That was a 270 degree loop turn coming in.</v>

3572
01:36:52.630 --> 01:36:55.900
<v Speaker 3>What the engine cowlings probably five feet off the deck.</v>

3573
01:36:56.380 --> 01:36:57.790
<v Speaker 3>A human pilot can't do that.</v>

3574
01:36:57.970 --> 01:36:59.470
<v Speaker 3>Really remote control can,</v>

3575
01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:00.540
<v Speaker 3>but here's</v>

3576
01:37:00.540 --> 01:37:01.341
<v Speaker 6>because they've had to be,</v>

3577
01:37:01.341 --> 01:37:01.671
<v Speaker 6>I'm sorry,</v>

3578
01:37:01.671 --> 01:37:04.280
<v Speaker 6>but they've had people actually try to attempt that in uh,</v>

3579
01:37:04.330 --> 01:37:04.660
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3580
01:37:04.660 --> 01:37:07.450
<v Speaker 6>in an aviation simulator and they weren't able to do well.</v>

3581
01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:12.130
<v Speaker 6>Is it a physical issue on understand what it is skilled?</v>

3582
01:37:12.530 --> 01:37:15.770
<v Speaker 6>You'd have to be just some bad ass fucking race car driver,</v>

3583
01:37:15.780 --> 01:37:16.613
<v Speaker 6>motherfucker,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

3586
01:37:20.690 --> 01:37:21.231
<v Speaker 6>Is that what it is,</v>

01:37:21.231 --> 01:37:21.640
<v Speaker 6>Liz?</v>

3588
01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:22.473
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3589
01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:22.950
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3590
01:37:22.950 --> 01:37:26.040
<v Speaker 3>and you must've practiced that one turn 10,000 times,</v>

3591
01:37:26.050 --> 01:37:26.883
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3592
01:37:27.420 --> 01:37:29.170
<v Speaker 3>You practice moves and Marshall Your sleep.</v>

3593
01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:31.050
<v Speaker 3>How often do you work a cotton before you,</v>

3594
01:37:31.090 --> 01:37:31.690
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3595
01:37:31.690 --> 01:37:32.050
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3596
01:37:32.050 --> 01:37:36.100
<v Speaker 3>so the Pentagon sits in a bowl when I was born in Washington DC.</v>

3597
01:37:36.130 --> 01:37:36.610
<v Speaker 3>I know it.</v>

3598
01:37:36.610 --> 01:37:37.210
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3599
01:37:37.210 --> 01:37:42.160
<v Speaker 3>And three 95 runs around the Pentagon and you can look right down and you see</v>

3600
01:37:42.161 --> 01:37:43.510
<v Speaker 3>the whole Pentagon sitting down there.</v>

3601
01:37:43.511 --> 01:37:43.871
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3602
01:37:43.871 --> 01:37:44.091
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3603
01:37:44.091 --> 01:37:44.480
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

3604
01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:44.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3605
01:37:44.980 --> 01:37:45.820
<v Speaker 3>sitting in the Roosevelt.</v>

3606
01:37:46.030 --> 01:37:46.863
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3607
01:37:46.930 --> 01:37:47.530
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

3608
01:37:47.530 --> 01:37:47.890
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3609
01:37:47.890 --> 01:37:52.890
<v Speaker 3>there were more than 400 witnesses on I three 95 truck drivers,</v>

3610
01:37:53.651 --> 01:37:54.610
<v Speaker 3>cab drivers,</v>

3611
01:37:54.611 --> 01:37:55.920
<v Speaker 3>soccer moms,</v>

3612
01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:57.053
<v Speaker 3>you name it.</v>

3613
01:37:57.540 --> 01:38:01.560
<v Speaker 3>They all saw an airplane hit the Pentagon and they would testify in court.</v>

3614
01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:02.530
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

3615
01:38:02.530 --> 01:38:03.510
<v Speaker 3>that's what they saw.</v>

3616
01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:06.240
<v Speaker 3>So regardless of what anybody thinks,</v>

3617
01:38:06.270 --> 01:38:07.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to argue.</v>

3618
01:38:07.171 --> 01:38:08.004
<v Speaker 3>The point is,</v>

3619
01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:09.180
<v Speaker 3>the fact is,</v>

3620
01:38:09.181 --> 01:38:11.490
<v Speaker 3>is to try the case in court and to Hang Dick Cheney,</v>

3621
01:38:11.491 --> 01:38:14.940
<v Speaker 3>which I can do without going down that side alley.</v>

3622
01:38:14.970 --> 01:38:15.990
<v Speaker 3>It's not important to me.</v>

3623
01:38:16.490 --> 01:38:16.620
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3624
01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:17.330
<v Speaker 3>but I do think,</v>

3625
01:38:17.330 --> 01:38:18.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3626
01:38:18.010 --> 01:38:18.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3627
01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:19.950
<v Speaker 3>a jet plane hit the Pentagon.</v>

3628
01:38:20.030 --> 01:38:20.191
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3629
01:38:20.191 --> 01:38:21.500
<v Speaker 1>they released that footage,</v>

3630
01:38:21.530 --> 01:38:25.460
<v Speaker 1>but it was like stop action was only a few frames and you can't really clearly</v>

3631
01:38:25.461 --> 01:38:26.710
<v Speaker 1>make out what the hell it is.</v>

3632
01:38:26.711 --> 01:38:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3633
01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think they did that?</v>

3634
01:38:28.251 --> 01:38:31.140
<v Speaker 1>Why don't they release like some clear footage in the,</v>

3635
01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:32.960
<v Speaker 1>you don't want people using it for propaganda?</v>

3636
01:38:32.961 --> 01:38:33.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3637
01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:34.910
<v Speaker 3>in the intelligence business,</v>

3638
01:38:34.970 --> 01:38:35.690
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3639
01:38:35.690 --> 01:38:38.630
<v Speaker 3>there's a program called cointelpro and many other,</v>

3640
01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:39.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3641
01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:40.850
<v Speaker 3>programs that,</v>

3642
01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:41.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3643
01:38:41.690 --> 01:38:46.690
<v Speaker 3>have been used and developed by CIA in Army intelligence on the creation of</v>

3644
01:38:48.051 --> 01:38:50.060
<v Speaker 3>false legends and false stories.</v>

3645
01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:51.320
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

3646
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:54.500
<v Speaker 3>one of the biggest deals in the intelligence trade is to,</v>

3647
01:38:54.501 --> 01:38:54.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3648
01:38:54.860 --> 01:38:57.940
<v Speaker 3>do a dangle dangle a in,</v>

3649
01:38:58.160 --> 01:38:59.270
<v Speaker 3>let's say I'm a spy.</v>

3650
01:38:59.570 --> 01:39:04.570
<v Speaker 3>A dangle would be like a five foot 10 woman right out of my ultimate sexual</v>

3651
01:39:04.581 --> 01:39:05.181
<v Speaker 3>fantasy,</v>

3652
01:39:05.181 --> 01:39:05.451
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3653
01:39:05.451 --> 01:39:05.631
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

3654
01:39:05.631 --> 01:39:05.840
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

3655
01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:06.673
<v Speaker 3>That's a dangle.</v>

3656
01:39:06.860 --> 01:39:09.380
<v Speaker 3>But sometimes a dangled comes in the form of information.</v>

3657
01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:13.620
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes a dangle comes in the form of attempting lead that looks like it's got</v>

3658
01:39:13.621 --> 01:39:14.720
<v Speaker 3>to really take you somewhere.</v>

3659
01:39:15.230 --> 01:39:15.381
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

3660
01:39:15.381 --> 01:39:16.430
<v Speaker 3>disinformation,</v>

3661
01:39:16.490 --> 01:39:19.100
<v Speaker 3>in order to be effective has to be 90% true.</v>

3662
01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.350
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise you won't swallow it.</v>

3663
01:39:22.100 --> 01:39:23.120
<v Speaker 3>You won't buy it.</v>

3664
01:39:23.450 --> 01:39:25.490
<v Speaker 3>So there's a poison pill that they put in,</v>

3665
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.950
<v Speaker 3>you swallow the 10% poison pill,</v>

3666
01:39:27.951 --> 01:39:30.020
<v Speaker 3>and then if you ever get enough traction,</v>

3667
01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:32.840
<v Speaker 3>they activate the poison and kill you.</v>

3668
01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:36.290
<v Speaker 3>So I do believe a plane hit the Pentagon and,</v>

3669
01:39:36.700 --> 01:39:37.221
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

3670
01:39:37.221 --> 01:39:38.510
<v Speaker 3>and what we saw,</v>

3671
01:39:38.511 --> 01:39:41.750
<v Speaker 3>we never saw a jetliner hit in any of those films.</v>

3672
01:39:42.230 --> 01:39:42.501
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3673
01:39:42.501 --> 01:39:43.920
<v Speaker 3>I think that was bait to,</v>

3674
01:39:43.970 --> 01:39:44.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3675
01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:46.520
<v Speaker 3>to see if that action got enough traction.</v>

3676
01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:50.180
<v Speaker 3>Then at some point they would come up and actually show you the video of a</v>

3677
01:39:50.181 --> 01:39:53.570
<v Speaker 3>jetliner hitting and all of a sudden everything else you've bought into as a</v>

3678
01:39:53.571 --> 01:39:55.760
<v Speaker 3>result is discredited.</v>

3679
01:39:55.850 --> 01:39:57.050
<v Speaker 3>He looks preposterous.</v>

3680
01:39:57.140 --> 01:39:57.973
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

3681
01:39:58.220 --> 01:39:58.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3682
01:39:58.431 --> 01:39:59.690
<v Speaker 1>I've always thought that was fascinating.</v>

3683
01:39:59.691 --> 01:40:01.880
<v Speaker 1>Like when you read someone's stories and you know,</v>

3684
01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.130
<v Speaker 1>you read something like that guy,</v>

3685
01:40:04.131 --> 01:40:05.870
<v Speaker 1>a behold a pale horse guy,</v>

3686
01:40:05.871 --> 01:40:07.940
<v Speaker 1>William Cooper's Braille Cooper.</v>

3687
01:40:08.290 --> 01:40:08.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3688
01:40:08.510 --> 01:40:09.590
<v Speaker 1>what was that guy's deal?</v>

3689
01:40:10.430 --> 01:40:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3690
01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:11.540
<v Speaker 1>because he would,</v>

3691
01:40:11.540 --> 01:40:12.380
<v Speaker 1>he was one of those guys,</v>

3692
01:40:12.381 --> 01:40:13.730
<v Speaker 1>let me just say before you even tell me,</v>

3693
01:40:14.090 --> 01:40:16.400
<v Speaker 1>he was one of those guys that I would read his stuff and I'll go,</v>

3694
01:40:16.401 --> 01:40:17.121
<v Speaker 1>well that makes sense.</v>

3695
01:40:17.121 --> 01:40:17.954
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

3696
01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:18.411
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3697
01:40:18.411 --> 01:40:19.460
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking crazy.</v>

3698
01:40:19.461 --> 01:40:20.294
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

3699
01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:21.300
<v Speaker 1>It was like that was the,</v>

3700
01:40:21.301 --> 01:40:21.501
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3701
01:40:21.501 --> 01:40:21.740
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3702
01:40:21.740 --> 01:40:22.700
<v Speaker 1>the exact progression.</v>

3703
01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:23.840
<v Speaker 1>And so that made me think,</v>

3704
01:40:23.841 --> 01:40:25.730
<v Speaker 1>well what if this guy is like working for them?</v>

3705
01:40:25.731 --> 01:40:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Like making everything else look retarded by coming up with this one idea that</v>

3706
01:40:29.271 --> 01:40:33.440
<v Speaker 1>he tosses in about bases on the moon where they're processing fucking compound</v>

3707
01:40:33.441 --> 01:40:35.060
<v Speaker 1>race tires for the corvette team.</v>

3708
01:40:35.210 --> 01:40:35.721
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3709
01:40:35.721 --> 01:40:36.170
<v Speaker 1>To me it's like,</v>

3710
01:40:36.170 --> 01:40:36.311
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3711
01:40:36.311 --> 01:40:36.711
<v Speaker 1>he was three.</v>

3712
01:40:36.711 --> 01:40:38.150
<v Speaker 1>He would say something like that and you're like,</v>

3713
01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:39.860
<v Speaker 1>the fuck is this guy talking about,</v>

3714
01:40:40.020 --> 01:40:40.853
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3715
01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:44.280
<v Speaker 3>there are lots of people like that and this is why I've walked a completely</v>

3716
01:40:44.281 --> 01:40:47.580
<v Speaker 3>different path because I had to walk a path of complete credibility for 35</v>

3717
01:40:47.581 --> 01:40:48.414
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

3718
01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:49.220
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

3719
01:40:49.220 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 1>you think there's people that are embedded in that path that are there just to</v>

3720
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:55.990
<v Speaker 5>say stupid shit like this credit things?</v>

3721
01:40:55.991 --> 01:40:56.351
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3722
01:40:56.351 --> 01:41:01.351
<v Speaker 5>But I also think there are some people who who are feel moved to tell the truth</v>

3723
01:41:01.931 --> 01:41:02.860
<v Speaker 5>cause they're outraged.</v>

3724
01:41:02.890 --> 01:41:03.723
<v Speaker 5>That's you.</v>

3725
01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:04.450
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3726
01:41:04.450 --> 01:41:05.820
<v Speaker 5>But those people would,</v>

3727
01:41:05.821 --> 01:41:06.654
<v Speaker 5>would all say,</v>

3728
01:41:06.730 --> 01:41:11.500
<v Speaker 5>I'll also say something that they know tells to the powers that be,</v>

3729
01:41:11.501 --> 01:41:12.550
<v Speaker 5>that they aren't a threat.</v>

3730
01:41:12.990 --> 01:41:14.200
<v Speaker 5>Well what's really funny is,</v>

3731
01:41:14.340 --> 01:41:15.460
<v Speaker 5>oh the lot of you guys,</v>

3732
01:41:15.461 --> 01:41:18.600
<v Speaker 5>and I don't want to lump anybody into a category and then I'm,</v>

3733
01:41:18.601 --> 01:41:22.660
<v Speaker 5>I'm certainly not putting you in with anybody else because I love your work,</v>

3734
01:41:22.690 --> 01:41:26.500
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of you guys think that it's not you,</v>

3735
01:41:26.530 --> 01:41:26.891
<v Speaker 5>not you,</v>

3736
01:41:26.891 --> 01:41:29.410
<v Speaker 5>but people along those lines or calling out the government.</v>

3737
01:41:29.710 --> 01:41:33.400
<v Speaker 5>They think that there are people out there that are shills like other guys that</v>

3738
01:41:33.401 --> 01:41:34.031
<v Speaker 5>are successful,</v>

3739
01:41:34.031 --> 01:41:35.050
<v Speaker 5>like their competition.</v>

3740
01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:36.030
<v Speaker 5>Oh that motherfucker.</v>

3741
01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:36.431
<v Speaker 5>He's a,</v>

3742
01:41:36.431 --> 01:41:37.570
<v Speaker 5>he's a CIA.</v>

3743
01:41:37.780 --> 01:41:38.591
<v Speaker 5>He's an operative.</v>

3744
01:41:38.591 --> 01:41:39.700
<v Speaker 5>Well I wouldn't say CIA,</v>

3745
01:41:39.701 --> 01:41:42.460
<v Speaker 5>but there are definite people out here for sure.</v>

3746
01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:43.800
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely right.</v>

3747
01:41:43.810 --> 01:41:44.350
<v Speaker 5>How many,</v>

3748
01:41:44.350 --> 01:41:47.440
<v Speaker 5>when you see like a guy on TV and you see him talking,</v>

3749
01:41:47.441 --> 01:41:48.081
<v Speaker 5>like how,</v>

3750
01:41:48.081 --> 01:41:50.980
<v Speaker 5>how much time do you give him before you start?</v>

3751
01:41:50.981 --> 01:41:55.570
<v Speaker 5>Like wondering if this guy is a plant while and you see any sort of a leader in</v>

3752
01:41:55.571 --> 01:41:55.721
<v Speaker 5>any,</v>

3753
01:41:55.721 --> 01:41:57.220
<v Speaker 5>any sort of a movement,</v>

3754
01:41:57.340 --> 01:41:58.660
<v Speaker 5>how much time when you watch them,</v>

3755
01:41:58.661 --> 01:41:59.650
<v Speaker 5>how much time do you like?</v>

3756
01:42:00.290 --> 01:42:00.490
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3757
01:42:00.490 --> 01:42:01.440
<v Speaker 5>my rule of thumb is,</v>

3758
01:42:01.441 --> 01:42:04.690
<v Speaker 5>is that they wouldn't be on TV unless they were already controlled.</v>

3759
01:42:04.691 --> 01:42:05.081
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>

3760
01:42:05.081 --> 01:42:07.090
<v Speaker 5>that's just the real simple way to look at it.</v>

3761
01:42:07.150 --> 01:42:07.480
<v Speaker 5>You don't,</v>

3762
01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:08.830
<v Speaker 5>you don't get the airtime.</v>

3763
01:42:09.050 --> 01:42:09.251
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

3764
01:42:09.251 --> 01:42:10.500
<v Speaker 5>I'm invisible to,</v>

3765
01:42:10.501 --> 01:42:11.334
<v Speaker 5>to the,</v>

3766
01:42:11.590 --> 01:42:12.550
<v Speaker 5>to the u s government.</v>

3767
01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:13.480
<v Speaker 5>I made it,</v>

3768
01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:14.290
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3769
01:42:14.290 --> 01:42:14.790
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3770
01:42:14.790 --> 01:42:17.290
<v Speaker 5>the video that's had some good play called say my fucking name.</v>

3771
01:42:17.291 --> 01:42:17.900
<v Speaker 5>It's up on you.</v>

3772
01:42:17.900 --> 01:42:18.733
<v Speaker 5>I saw that.</v>

3773
01:42:18.750 --> 01:42:19.530
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

3774
01:42:19.530 --> 01:42:19.900
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3775
01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:20.711
<v Speaker 5>and it's fascinating.</v>

3776
01:42:20.711 --> 01:42:21.730
<v Speaker 5>I've done all his shit.</v>

3777
01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:22.270
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3778
01:42:22.270 --> 01:42:23.890
<v Speaker 5>And it sounded a bit like a jilted lover.</v>

3779
01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:24.430
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

3780
01:42:24.430 --> 01:42:25.263
<v Speaker 5>But if,</v>

3781
01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:25.961
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

3782
01:42:25.961 --> 01:42:27.210
<v Speaker 5>Like it was a check that,</v>

3783
01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:28.990
<v Speaker 5>but I was also everybody in the rolling stones,</v>

3784
01:42:28.991 --> 01:42:29.830
<v Speaker 5>we are pissed off.</v>

3785
01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:30.710
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3786
01:42:30.710 --> 01:42:31.330
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure.</v>

3787
01:42:31.330 --> 01:42:31.601
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3788
01:42:31.601 --> 01:42:31.790
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3789
01:42:31.790 --> 01:42:34.230
<v Speaker 5>it makes sense because I've been saying all this shit and,</v>

3790
01:42:34.231 --> 01:42:38.230
<v Speaker 5>and like the US government spent a State Department has spent $3 million</v>

3791
01:42:38.231 --> 01:42:41.350
<v Speaker 5>refuting every other nine 11 theory out there,</v>

3792
01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:42.041
<v Speaker 5>but not yours.</v>

3793
01:42:42.041 --> 01:42:43.300
<v Speaker 5>She couldn't mention my name.</v>

3794
01:42:43.850 --> 01:42:47.800
<v Speaker 5>So does it feel like they don't have to address you because you don't have as</v>

3795
01:42:47.801 --> 01:42:51.960
<v Speaker 5>much mainstream exposure is say you know any of these other guys that you,</v>

3796
01:42:51.961 --> 01:42:52.181
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3797
01:42:52.181 --> 01:42:52.900
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

3798
01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:53.800
<v Speaker 5>Is that what it is?</v>

3799
01:42:53.801 --> 01:42:54.280
<v Speaker 5>Wait a minute.</v>

3800
01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:54.760
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3801
01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:55.570
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

3802
01:42:55.570 --> 01:42:55.990
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3803
01:42:55.990 --> 01:42:58.600
<v Speaker 5>I was in this really successful movie called collapse.</v>

3804
01:42:58.601 --> 01:43:00.220
<v Speaker 5>It's been seen all over the world.</v>

3805
01:43:00.490 --> 01:43:03.300
<v Speaker 5>That's obviously [inaudible] copies of that APP.</v>

3806
01:43:03.330 --> 01:43:06.850
<v Speaker 5>But you're obviously not on the cspan shows or CNN shows.</v>

3807
01:43:06.850 --> 01:43:08.410
<v Speaker 5>You're not being interviewed all the time.</v>

3808
01:43:08.411 --> 01:43:09.270
<v Speaker 5>I've been blacklisted.</v>

3809
01:43:09.330 --> 01:43:09.550
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3810
01:43:09.550 --> 01:43:10.480
<v Speaker 5>But why is that?</v>

3811
01:43:10.570 --> 01:43:15.110
<v Speaker 5>If all is he just cause they can't control you just say 100% true.</v>

3812
01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:16.630
<v Speaker 5>They can't shut me down.</v>

3813
01:43:17.170 --> 01:43:19.290
<v Speaker 5>I've left a record of 3 million words in,</v>

3814
01:43:19.291 --> 01:43:20.021
<v Speaker 5>in Rubicon,</v>

3815
01:43:20.021 --> 01:43:21.520
<v Speaker 5>there's a thousand footnotes.</v>

3816
01:43:21.521 --> 01:43:22.780
<v Speaker 5>So no matter how many books,</v>

3817
01:43:22.781 --> 01:43:23.441
<v Speaker 5>this cells,</v>

3818
01:43:23.441 --> 01:43:25.090
<v Speaker 5>no matter how many people watch,</v>

3819
01:43:25.091 --> 01:43:25.924
<v Speaker 5>collapse,</v>

3820
01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:27.520
<v Speaker 5>they'll keep you off those other shows.</v>

3821
01:43:27.810 --> 01:43:28.643
<v Speaker 5>So there's absolutely,</v>

3822
01:43:28.870 --> 01:43:32.650
<v Speaker 5>and that plays out real well with native American spirituality,</v>

3823
01:43:32.651 --> 01:43:33.520
<v Speaker 5>which was something that,</v>

3824
01:43:33.550 --> 01:43:33.971
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

3825
01:43:33.971 --> 01:43:34.150
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3826
01:43:34.150 --> 01:43:36.220
<v Speaker 5>that I've come to understand and really appreciate it.</v>

3827
01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:37.143
<v Speaker 5>I'm deeper into it.</v>

3828
01:43:37.570 --> 01:43:37.871
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

3829
01:43:37.871 --> 01:43:38.320
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3830
01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:41.470
<v Speaker 5>there's different kinds of medicine attributed to different kinds of animals.</v>

3831
01:43:41.950 --> 01:43:42.581
<v Speaker 5>Bear medicine.</v>

3832
01:43:42.581 --> 01:43:44.800
<v Speaker 5>Fox medicine has been very powerful for me.</v>

3833
01:43:45.190 --> 01:43:47.260
<v Speaker 5>Is that what is one that makes your penis hard?</v>

3834
01:43:47.261 --> 01:43:49.010
<v Speaker 5>Is that tiger medicine that could,</v>

3835
01:43:49.020 --> 01:43:50.860
<v Speaker 5>didn't know that's a squab medicine.</v>

3836
01:43:51.050 --> 01:43:51.883
<v Speaker 5>Squamish.</v>

3837
01:43:53.690 --> 01:43:57.130
<v Speaker 6>So what do you mean by like bear medicine and Fox medicine?</v>

3838
01:43:57.380 --> 01:43:58.071
<v Speaker 3>It's very important.</v>

3839
01:43:58.071 --> 01:44:00.620
<v Speaker 3>I've had a couple of very powerful encounters with foxes,</v>

3840
01:44:01.100 --> 01:44:04.160
<v Speaker 3>Fox medicine in native American spirituality and makes you invisible.</v>

3841
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:05.331
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

3842
01:44:05.331 --> 01:44:07.290
<v Speaker 3>I am invisible to the powers that</v>

3843
01:44:07.330 --> 01:44:08.560
<v Speaker 6>do you work for the government?</v>

3844
01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:09.940
<v Speaker 6>Because this is what's going on here.</v>

3845
01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:10.330
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3846
01:44:10.330 --> 01:44:10.511
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3847
01:44:10.511 --> 01:44:10.961
<v Speaker 6>I'm just kidding.</v>

3848
01:44:10.961 --> 01:44:11.131
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3849
01:44:11.131 --> 01:44:11.964
<v Speaker 6>I know.</v>

3850
01:44:11.970 --> 01:44:15.210
<v Speaker 6>But you're saying crazy stuff now you're saying crazy stuffs about Fox being</v>

3851
01:44:15.220 --> 01:44:15.840
<v Speaker 6>invisible.</v>

3852
01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:16.360
<v Speaker 6>And so if Pete,</v>

3853
01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:18.970
<v Speaker 6>if somebody thought that you were a disinformation agent,</v>

3854
01:44:18.971 --> 01:44:19.301
<v Speaker 6>they would say,</v>

3855
01:44:19.301 --> 01:44:19.511
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

3856
01:44:19.511 --> 01:44:20.470
<v Speaker 6>here's the evidence.</v>

3857
01:44:20.620 --> 01:44:21.770
<v Speaker 6>He says all this brilliant shit.</v>

3858
01:44:21.771 --> 01:44:23.590
<v Speaker 6>And then he starts talking about foxes being invisible.</v>

3859
01:44:23.630 --> 01:44:23.771
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3860
01:44:23.771 --> 01:44:24.910
<v Speaker 6>I didn't say Fox is invisible.</v>

3861
01:44:26.170 --> 01:44:27.003
<v Speaker 6>I'm invisible.</v>

3862
01:44:27.010 --> 01:44:27.401
<v Speaker 6>Oh.</v>

3863
01:44:27.401 --> 01:44:28.390
<v Speaker 6>And I'm invisible</v>

3864
01:44:29.210 --> 01:44:30.590
<v Speaker 3>to mainstream media.</v>

3865
01:44:30.850 --> 01:44:31.220
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3866
01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:33.470
<v Speaker 3>They all read me that they've all read.</v>

3867
01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:34.400
<v Speaker 3>They all know who I am.</v>

3868
01:44:34.401 --> 01:44:35.480
<v Speaker 3>They just can't say my name.</v>

3869
01:44:35.850 --> 01:44:37.820
<v Speaker 3>And that made me mad.</v>

3870
01:44:37.821 --> 01:44:42.080
<v Speaker 3>ButW I made that tape it because I was so pissed off that everything was falling</v>

3871
01:44:42.081 --> 01:44:46.940
<v Speaker 3>apart and nobody was talking about how criminal and how fucked up.</v>

3872
01:44:46.941 --> 01:44:50.060
<v Speaker 3>This wasn't a whole generation of people are talking about it though,</v>

3873
01:44:50.061 --> 01:44:50.661
<v Speaker 3>don't you think?</v>

3874
01:44:50.661 --> 01:44:52.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean at this point a lot of people were talking,</v>

3875
01:44:52.590 --> 01:44:53.900
<v Speaker 3>but if they say my name,</v>

3876
01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:57.740
<v Speaker 3>it's game over because then they have to see the body of work.</v>

3877
01:44:58.300 --> 01:44:58.660
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

3878
01:44:58.660 --> 01:44:59.071
<v Speaker 6>but what you,</v>

3879
01:44:59.071 --> 01:45:03.550
<v Speaker 6>so you saying that all these people that are in any position of power that are,</v>

3880
01:45:03.730 --> 01:45:03.911
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3881
01:45:03.911 --> 01:45:05.380
<v Speaker 6>saying the sky is falling,</v>

3882
01:45:05.381 --> 01:45:06.131
<v Speaker 6>it's all falling apart,</v>

3883
01:45:06.131 --> 01:45:07.600
<v Speaker 6>but whatever you do don't talk about like a rubric.</v>

3884
01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:10.070
<v Speaker 3>Don't give him the mic.</v>

3885
01:45:10.950 --> 01:45:11.371
<v Speaker 6>Why did they,</v>

3886
01:45:11.371 --> 01:45:11.511
<v Speaker 6>why,</v>

3887
01:45:11.511 --> 01:45:11.680
<v Speaker 6>why?</v>

3888
01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:12.511
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

3889
01:45:12.511 --> 01:45:14.580
<v Speaker 6>You seem like the perfect person to talk about this stuff,</v>

3890
01:45:14.630 --> 01:45:16.210
<v Speaker 6>but someone has to be an expert.</v>

3891
01:45:16.230 --> 01:45:16.830
<v Speaker 6>I'm good at.</v>

3892
01:45:16.830 --> 01:45:17.650
<v Speaker 6>But then I'm gonna</v>

3893
01:45:17.650 --> 01:45:19.180
<v Speaker 3>proved that CNN,</v>

3894
01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:20.810
<v Speaker 3>that ABC,</v>

3895
01:45:21.010 --> 01:45:25.450
<v Speaker 3>that all the corporate owned media is absolutely criminally corrupt and</v>

3896
01:45:25.451 --> 01:45:29.730
<v Speaker 3>complicit and all the economic criminality that's been taking place and covering</v>

3897
01:45:29.740 --> 01:45:31.150
<v Speaker 3>up all these other crimes.</v>

3898
01:45:31.660 --> 01:45:35.560
<v Speaker 3>Every major media outlet in this country trades it's shares on Wall Street and</v>

3899
01:45:35.561 --> 01:45:37.810
<v Speaker 3>they're all part of the same economic paradigm.</v>

3900
01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:40.180
<v Speaker 3>And they can't afford to see me.</v>

3901
01:45:40.780 --> 01:45:41.620
<v Speaker 3>And it's not just me.</v>

3902
01:45:41.621 --> 01:45:43.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean all the people who did peak oil,</v>

3903
01:45:43.571 --> 01:45:43.741
<v Speaker 3>who'd,</v>

3904
01:45:43.741 --> 01:45:43.920
<v Speaker 3>who'd,</v>

3905
01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:44.890
<v Speaker 3>who've done the work on,</v>

3906
01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:45.993
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3907
01:45:46.750 --> 01:45:49.030
<v Speaker 3>they see me because I give credit to everybody else.</v>

3908
01:45:49.031 --> 01:45:51.790
<v Speaker 3>They got to see all this other body of work that they've ignored.</v>

3909
01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:52.720
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

3910
01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:55.000
<v Speaker 6>so if the cop talked to you about any of this stuff,</v>

3911
01:45:55.150 --> 01:45:56.590
<v Speaker 6>then it opens up the flood gates,</v>

3912
01:45:56.591 --> 01:45:58.330
<v Speaker 6>the CIA selling drugs and all this.</v>

3913
01:45:58.360 --> 01:45:58.751
<v Speaker 6>So they're like,</v>

3914
01:45:58.751 --> 01:45:59.531
<v Speaker 6>shut the fuck up.</v>

3956
01:46:37.470 --> 01:46:38.011
<v Speaker 3>whips out there.</v>

3957
01:46:38.011 --> 01:46:38.844
<v Speaker 3>Amy Goodman,</v>

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:40.020
<v Speaker 3>democracy too late.</v>

01:46:40.030 --> 01:46:40.211
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>

3960
01:46:40.211 --> 01:46:40.370
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

3961
01:46:40.370 --> 01:46:42.780
<v Speaker 3>she talks about all these great issues that,</v>

3962
01:46:42.810 --> 01:46:43.141
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3963
01:46:43.141 --> 01:46:44.520
<v Speaker 3>that don't change anything.</v>

3964
01:46:44.521 --> 01:46:45.540
<v Speaker 3>She's like a gatekeeper.</v>

3965
01:46:45.541 --> 01:46:47.730
<v Speaker 3>And she syndicated by Rupert Murdoch.</v>

3966
01:46:47.880 --> 01:46:49.050
<v Speaker 3>Do you think she works for the government?</v>

3967
01:46:49.170 --> 01:46:49.610
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3968
01:46:49.610 --> 01:46:50.443
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3969
01:46:50.460 --> 01:46:50.821
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

3970
01:46:50.821 --> 01:46:51.900
<v Speaker 3>let's rephrase that.</v>

3971
01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:54.090
<v Speaker 3>I think she knows who butters their bread.</v>

3972
01:46:55.930 --> 01:46:56.763
<v Speaker 1>So it's fucked.</v>

3973
01:46:56.890 --> 01:46:58.600
<v Speaker 1>But the Internet is the only hope.</v>

3974
01:46:58.601 --> 01:46:59.170
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3975
01:46:59.170 --> 01:47:01.930
<v Speaker 1>But now that there's stuff like Sopa right.</v>

3976
01:47:01.931 --> 01:47:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Is it is the stop online piracy act.</v>

3977
01:47:04.490 --> 01:47:08.770
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people who are paranoid about this see this as a back door to</v>

3978
01:47:08.771 --> 01:47:09.491
<v Speaker 1>passively,</v>

01:47:18.170 --> 01:47:20.700
<v Speaker 3>which talks about some of the stuff that government can do.</v>

3988
01:47:21.180 --> 01:47:24.090
<v Speaker 3>The government can now anything that they want to do right now.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Sopa doesn't scare me enough cause sopas just kind of legalizing something that</v>

01:47:55.830 --> 01:47:56.610
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4010
01:47:56.610 --> 01:47:57.720
<v Speaker 3>they're doing all that now.</v>

4011
01:47:57.721 --> 01:47:58.750
<v Speaker 3>They've done it to occupy me.</v>

4012
01:47:58.830 --> 01:48:00.810
<v Speaker 3>And of course we see anonymous doing that back.</v>

4013
01:48:00.811 --> 01:48:01.950
<v Speaker 3>So that happens.</v>

4014
01:48:01.951 --> 01:48:06.180
<v Speaker 3>But so I'm not so much worried about Sopa because I know the bathrooms are going</v>

4015
01:48:06.181 --> 01:48:06.810
<v Speaker 3>to do that.</v>

4016
01:48:06.810 --> 01:48:09.930
<v Speaker 1>So that to you is just like sort of confirming something that has already been</v>

4017
01:48:09.931 --> 01:48:10.471
<v Speaker 1>in play.</v>

4018
01:48:10.471 --> 01:48:11.400
<v Speaker 1>It means nothing.</v>

4019
01:48:11.430 --> 01:48:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's changed.</v>

4020
01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:12.661
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4021
01:48:12.661 --> 01:48:13.950
<v Speaker 1>it was already bought and sold.</v>

4022
01:48:14.050 --> 01:48:19.050
<v Speaker 3>They're going to go to another degree of difficulty or another level of</v>

4023
01:48:19.151 --> 01:48:20.140
<v Speaker 3>intensity with that.</v>

4024
01:48:20.141 --> 01:48:20.440
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

4025
01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:22.180
<v Speaker 3>but the detention,</v>

4026
01:48:22.330 --> 01:48:22.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4027
01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:27.160
<v Speaker 3>provisions in the NDA totally violate habeas corpus.</v>

4028
01:48:27.310 --> 01:48:28.143
<v Speaker 3>Magna Carta,</v>

4029
01:48:28.210 --> 01:48:29.470
<v Speaker 3>US Constitution.</v>

4030
01:48:29.471 --> 01:48:30.790
<v Speaker 3>That's fundamental.</v>

4031
01:48:31.390 --> 01:48:31.841
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

4032
01:48:31.841 --> 01:48:33.610
<v Speaker 3>and if that bill gets signed,</v>

4033
01:48:34.030 --> 01:48:36.070
<v Speaker 3>the United States of America no longer exists.</v>

4034
01:48:36.660 --> 01:48:37.421
<v Speaker 1>Nicholas a thing to,</v>

4035
01:48:37.421 --> 01:48:40.770
<v Speaker 1>things have gotten so bad that they think they need to pass that look.</v>

4036
01:48:40.780 --> 01:48:40.961
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4037
01:48:40.961 --> 01:48:41.800
<v Speaker 1>It's not that bad.</v>

4038
01:48:41.801 --> 01:48:43.330
<v Speaker 1>So you've got a few people protesting.</v>

4039
01:48:43.331 --> 01:48:44.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4040
01:48:44.020 --> 01:48:44.711
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

4041
01:48:44.711 --> 01:48:46.960
<v Speaker 1>you don't need to have the military and the fucking streets.</v>

4042
01:48:46.961 --> 01:48:47.320
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

4043
01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:47.771
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

4044
01:48:47.771 --> 01:48:48.910
<v Speaker 1>it's not that big a deal.</v>

4045
01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:50.310
<v Speaker 1>But what the problem is,</v>

4046
01:48:50.311 --> 01:48:51.580
<v Speaker 1>is they're looking at the next step.</v>

4047
01:48:51.820 --> 01:48:53.140
<v Speaker 1>They're saying this is unpredicted.</v>

4048
01:48:53.141 --> 01:48:54.580
<v Speaker 1>They never thought that they would see this.</v>

4049
01:48:54.581 --> 01:48:57.250
<v Speaker 1>They never thought they would see hundreds of thousands of people,</v>

4050
01:48:57.310 --> 01:48:58.143
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4051
01:48:58.450 --> 01:49:00.010
<v Speaker 1>ranting in the streets,</v>

4052
01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:01.210
<v Speaker 1>chanting in the streets,</v>

4053
01:49:01.211 --> 01:49:01.930
<v Speaker 1>holding signs,</v>

4054
01:49:01.930 --> 01:49:02.650
<v Speaker 1>wandering around,</v>

4055
01:49:02.650 --> 01:49:05.470
<v Speaker 1>and then camping out like what the fuck is going on?</v>

4056
01:49:05.620 --> 01:49:08.200
<v Speaker 1>So this is why they showed their hand.</v>

4057
01:49:08.270 --> 01:49:10.570
<v Speaker 3>But they have also been very aware,</v>

4058
01:49:10.590 --> 01:49:10.881
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

4059
01:49:10.881 --> 01:49:13.370
<v Speaker 3>that there are,</v>

4060
01:49:13.750 --> 01:49:14.583
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4061
01:49:16.190 --> 01:49:16.881
<v Speaker 3>50,</v>

4062
01:49:16.881 --> 01:49:21.440
<v Speaker 3>60 million hardcore unemployed homeless people and the number is growing.</v>

4063
01:49:21.890 --> 01:49:23.150
<v Speaker 3>They're aware that,</v>

4064
01:49:23.151 --> 01:49:23.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4065
01:49:23.570 --> 01:49:24.250
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

4066
01:49:24.250 --> 01:49:24.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4067
01:49:24.350 --> 01:49:28.820
<v Speaker 3>it's a one in two of the people in this country can be classified under the</v>

4068
01:49:28.821 --> 01:49:29.600
<v Speaker 3>poverty line.</v>

4069
01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:31.190
<v Speaker 3>Half of the population,</v>

4070
01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:34.580
<v Speaker 3>one in every six Americans is on food stamps.</v>

4071
01:49:35.090 --> 01:49:36.350
<v Speaker 3>People are starving,</v>

4072
01:49:36.380 --> 01:49:37.191
<v Speaker 3>they're freezing,</v>

4073
01:49:37.191 --> 01:49:38.210
<v Speaker 3>they've lost their jobs,</v>

4074
01:49:38.211 --> 01:49:39.110
<v Speaker 3>they've lost their money.</v>

4075
01:49:39.230 --> 01:49:41.150
<v Speaker 3>They've known this was going to be coming too.</v>

4076
01:49:41.630 --> 01:49:43.430
<v Speaker 3>But I think there's another reason for this,</v>

4077
01:49:43.431 --> 01:49:43.551
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4078
01:49:43.551 --> 01:49:47.410
<v Speaker 3>with the planned attack on Iran is,</v>

4079
01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 3>is so that</v>

4080
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:51.670
<v Speaker 5>they can do a round up of Arab Americans like they did with the Japanese right</v>

4081
01:49:51.671 --> 01:49:53.650
<v Speaker 5>after World War II and put them in camps.</v>

4082
01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:55.810
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ.</v>

4083
01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:01.030
<v Speaker 5>So you think that the ultimate goal is to start locking giant groups of people</v>

4084
01:50:01.031 --> 01:50:01.960
<v Speaker 5>up in Fema camps?</v>

4085
01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:02.770
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

4086
01:50:02.770 --> 01:50:06.880
<v Speaker 5>And this is where I did I disagree strongly with some people.</v>

4087
01:50:07.130 --> 01:50:07.790
<v Speaker 5>Alex Jones.</v>

4088
01:50:07.790 --> 01:50:08.060
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4089
01:50:08.060 --> 01:50:08.760
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>

4090
01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:09.310
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4091
01:50:09.310 --> 01:50:10.143
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

4092
01:50:10.780 --> 01:50:14.140
<v Speaker 5>it takes money to feed people.</v>

4093
01:50:14.350 --> 01:50:15.880
<v Speaker 5>You have to pay the guards,</v>

4094
01:50:16.060 --> 01:50:17.530
<v Speaker 5>you have to build the camps,</v>

4095
01:50:17.620 --> 01:50:18.940
<v Speaker 5>you have to put gasoline,</v>

4096
01:50:18.941 --> 01:50:20.410
<v Speaker 5>you have to heat for the people.</v>

4097
01:50:20.770 --> 01:50:25.770
<v Speaker 5>And human industrial civilization is collapsing if you think to what the powers</v>

4098
01:50:26.141 --> 01:50:26.471
<v Speaker 5>that be,</v>

4099
01:50:26.471 --> 01:50:28.720
<v Speaker 5>the money people did during the Great Depression,</v>

4100
01:50:29.410 --> 01:50:30.790
<v Speaker 5>they didn't put all the homeless,</v>

4101
01:50:30.791 --> 01:50:31.690
<v Speaker 5>starving and camps.</v>

4102
01:50:31.691 --> 01:50:32.320
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4103
01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:36.520
<v Speaker 5>they let them drag themselves across the country from the Oklahoma Dust Bowl,</v>

4104
01:50:36.521 --> 01:50:37.351
<v Speaker 5>the California.</v>

4105
01:50:37.351 --> 01:50:38.800
<v Speaker 5>And if they starved along the way,</v>

4106
01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:40.660
<v Speaker 5>the government wasn't paying a penny.</v>

4107
01:50:40.661 --> 01:50:41.530
<v Speaker 5>It costs nothing.</v>

4108
01:50:41.530 --> 01:50:45.370
<v Speaker 5>It weeded out the population and the strongest made it to California to work for</v>

4109
01:50:45.371 --> 01:50:46.204
<v Speaker 5>slave wages.</v>

4110
01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:49.150
<v Speaker 5>That's the evil of the beast.</v>

4111
01:50:49.151 --> 01:50:50.050
<v Speaker 5>They will have camps,</v>

4112
01:50:50.051 --> 01:50:50.291
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4113
01:50:50.291 --> 01:50:54.430
<v Speaker 5>for people like me or if there's major civil unrest in some cities or something</v>

4114
01:50:54.431 --> 01:50:54.821
<v Speaker 5>like that,</v>

4115
01:50:54.821 --> 01:50:55.960
<v Speaker 5>but no longterm,</v>

4116
01:50:56.020 --> 01:50:58.420
<v Speaker 5>because the resources don't exist to do that.</v>

4117
01:50:58.600 --> 01:50:59.890
<v Speaker 5>So the idea is this,</v>

4118
01:50:59.891 --> 01:51:00.611
<v Speaker 5>kill everybody.</v>

4119
01:51:00.611 --> 01:51:02.200
<v Speaker 5>Then let them starve.</v>

4120
01:51:02.290 --> 01:51:03.071
<v Speaker 5>Let Them Starve,</v>

4121
01:51:03.071 --> 01:51:03.970
<v Speaker 5>starve to death.</v>

4122
01:51:04.060 --> 01:51:08.950
<v Speaker 5>Let him catch disease or so in turn them and then make them sick.</v>

4123
01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:12.040
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't go that far.</v>

4124
01:51:12.070 --> 01:51:12.371
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4125
01:51:12.371 --> 01:51:12.840
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4126
01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:13.580
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4127
01:51:13.580 --> 01:51:15.910
<v Speaker 5>I mean ultimately if they know that that's what's got to go down,</v>

4128
01:51:16.300 --> 01:51:16.930
<v Speaker 5>why not just,</v>

4129
01:51:16.930 --> 01:51:17.500
<v Speaker 5>and everybody,</v>

4130
01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:18.820
<v Speaker 5>well that was Diana,</v>

4131
01:51:18.821 --> 01:51:19.421
<v Speaker 5>Jim Jones,</v>

4132
01:51:19.421 --> 01:51:19.871
<v Speaker 5>everybody.</v>

4133
01:51:19.871 --> 01:51:20.081
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4134
01:51:20.081 --> 01:51:20.321
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4135
01:51:20.321 --> 01:51:20.680
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

4136
01:51:20.680 --> 01:51:21.001
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

4137
01:51:21.001 --> 01:51:23.730
<v Speaker 5>that was a Nazi plan and that didn't work.</v>

4138
01:51:23.731 --> 01:51:26.410
<v Speaker 5>The fascism has become much more sophisticated since then.</v>

4139
01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:27.531
<v Speaker 5>So what,</v>

4140
01:51:27.531 --> 01:51:27.711
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

4141
01:51:27.711 --> 01:51:30.460
<v Speaker 5>what are the other options when it's completely hit the fan?</v>

4142
01:51:30.490 --> 01:51:33.010
<v Speaker 5>What are the other options to get rid of a giant group of people?</v>

4143
01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:34.113
<v Speaker 5>You let,</v>

4144
01:51:34.210 --> 01:51:36.190
<v Speaker 5>you let the cities go,</v>

4145
01:51:37.010 --> 01:51:37.600
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4146
01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:38.350
<v Speaker 5>you let the people,</v>

4147
01:51:38.350 --> 01:51:40.300
<v Speaker 5>it's happening all over the world right now.</v>

4148
01:51:40.301 --> 01:51:42.490
<v Speaker 5>And you think that's unquestionably a plan.</v>

4149
01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:43.780
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

4150
01:51:43.780 --> 01:51:44.140
<v Speaker 5>Who,</v>

4151
01:51:44.140 --> 01:51:44.350
<v Speaker 5>who,</v>

4152
01:51:44.350 --> 01:51:46.540
<v Speaker 5>who's planning to have all these cities fall apart?</v>

4153
01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:46.670
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

4154
01:51:46.670 --> 01:51:47.020
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4155
01:51:47.020 --> 01:51:47.853
<v Speaker 5>the bankers,</v>

4156
01:51:47.980 --> 01:51:48.640
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

4157
01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:53.640
<v Speaker 5>nobody plans for city x or citywide a fall apart that way on a day just engineer</v>

4158
01:51:54.311 --> 01:51:56.420
<v Speaker 5>corruption into the systems to the point where they,</v>

4159
01:51:56.710 --> 01:51:58.930
<v Speaker 5>and you believe it's engineered well,</v>

4160
01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:01.580
<v Speaker 5>is it just greed and it is a,</v>

4161
01:52:01.620 --> 01:52:02.080
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4162
01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:03.250
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's what I'm confused about.</v>

4163
01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:05.590
<v Speaker 5>It collapses a fait accompli.</v>

4164
01:52:05.650 --> 01:52:07.930
<v Speaker 5>That's a simple matter of what does that mean?</v>

4165
01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:08.833
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4166
01:52:08.930 --> 01:52:10.510
<v Speaker 5>it's a done deal.</v>

4167
01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:13.810
<v Speaker 5>Au fait accompli limit of what language is that French?</v>

4168
01:52:13.990 --> 01:52:16.580
<v Speaker 5>Why is it so cool when he's quote something and we could just say,</v>

4169
01:52:16.581 --> 01:52:19.060
<v Speaker 5>well faith it is right.</v>

4170
01:52:19.060 --> 01:52:20.110
<v Speaker 5>That's a good way to get laid.</v>

4171
01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:20.720
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>

4172
01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:21.190
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4173
01:52:21.190 --> 01:52:24.580
<v Speaker 5>so the resource limitations govern.</v>

4174
01:52:24.610 --> 01:52:25.300
<v Speaker 5>Collapse,</v>

4175
01:52:25.300 --> 01:52:25.471
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

4176
01:52:25.471 --> 01:52:26.170
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

4177
01:52:26.170 --> 01:52:27.250
<v Speaker 5>6 billion people.</v>

4178
01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:28.750
<v Speaker 5>So because of the way society is set up,</v>

4179
01:52:28.751 --> 01:52:31.110
<v Speaker 5>there's no way all going to collapse and wear out anyway.</v>

4180
01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:32.680
<v Speaker 5>We need a resource based society.</v>

4181
01:52:32.681 --> 01:52:33.760
<v Speaker 5>We can't have the derivatives,</v>

4182
01:52:33.761 --> 01:52:36.640
<v Speaker 5>we can't have this nonsense economy and we can't have infinite growth.</v>

4183
01:52:36.641 --> 01:52:40.030
<v Speaker 5>But all the powers that be want to do is make money on the way up and maximize</v>

4184
01:52:40.031 --> 01:52:41.200
<v Speaker 5>profit on the way down.</v>

4185
01:52:41.230 --> 01:52:45.230
<v Speaker 5>So they're just trying to money grab right now and just as much as possible is</v>

4186
01:52:45.231 --> 01:52:50.231
<v Speaker 5>more profitable to destroy things now than it is to save them in the NBA is</v>

4187
01:52:50.361 --> 01:52:51.860
<v Speaker 5>basically just like what we need.</v>

4188
01:52:51.861 --> 01:52:56.210
<v Speaker 5>We need to keep fucking peace in the streets where were stealing money or scare</v>

4189
01:52:56.211 --> 01:52:56.980
<v Speaker 5>the people in the,</v>

4190
01:52:56.980 --> 01:52:57.813
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

4191
01:52:57.890 --> 01:52:59.030
<v Speaker 5>they have crazy laws.</v>

4192
01:52:59.031 --> 01:53:00.500
<v Speaker 5>We can just lock people up.</v>

4193
01:53:00.900 --> 01:53:02.480
<v Speaker 5>You know who's lagging me blow up though.</v>

4194
01:53:02.481 --> 01:53:03.740
<v Speaker 5>That's where it gets really ridiculous.</v>

4195
01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:08.450
<v Speaker 5>It at one point in time someone has to realize that the structure of this,</v>

4196
01:53:08.451 --> 01:53:08.691
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4197
01:53:08.691 --> 01:53:09.650
<v Speaker 5>this monarchy,</v>

4198
01:53:09.651 --> 01:53:10.130
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

4199
01:53:10.130 --> 01:53:10.401
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

4200
01:53:10.401 --> 01:53:10.671
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

4201
01:53:10.671 --> 01:53:11.090
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4202
01:53:11.090 --> 01:53:14.480
<v Speaker 5>this fucking king ship that's taken over the world.</v>

4203
01:53:14.690 --> 01:53:18.380
<v Speaker 5>It only works if people were willing to take up guns and only works if the</v>

4204
01:53:18.381 --> 01:53:20.840
<v Speaker 5>common folk are willing to push around everybody else.</v>

4205
01:53:21.230 --> 01:53:21.441
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4206
01:53:21.441 --> 01:53:24.110
<v Speaker 5>that's the only way it works out really work.</v>

4207
01:53:24.350 --> 01:53:25.220
<v Speaker 5>If everybody goes,</v>

4208
01:53:25.221 --> 01:53:25.570
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>

4209
01:53:25.570 --> 01:53:26.030
<v Speaker 5>where's it?</v>

4210
01:53:26.030 --> 01:53:26.780
<v Speaker 5>Fuck you.</v>

4211
01:53:26.780 --> 01:53:27.111
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4212
01:53:27.111 --> 01:53:27.291
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4213
01:53:27.291 --> 01:53:28.101
<v Speaker 5>you need the cops.</v>

4214
01:53:28.101 --> 01:53:28.934
<v Speaker 5>He knew me like a guy,</v>

4215
01:53:28.940 --> 01:53:31.160
<v Speaker 5>like a guy like you who steps out and you know,</v>

4216
01:53:31.161 --> 01:53:34.730
<v Speaker 5>when you were a cop and you saw this corruption and you step to what you were a</v>

4217
01:53:34.731 --> 01:53:37.910
<v Speaker 5>regular person instead of identifying yourself with this organization that was</v>

4218
01:53:37.911 --> 01:53:38.900
<v Speaker 5>obviously sick,</v>

4219
01:53:39.080 --> 01:53:42.350
<v Speaker 5>you identified yourself with your morals and your character and your upbringing</v>

4220
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:42.861
<v Speaker 5>and you said,</v>

4221
01:53:42.861 --> 01:53:43.700
<v Speaker 5>fuck you.</v>

4222
01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:45.380
<v Speaker 5>The CIA selling trucks,</v>

4223
01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:45.981
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4224
01:53:45.981 --> 01:53:47.510
<v Speaker 5>at some point in time doesn't,</v>

4225
01:53:47.660 --> 01:53:47.970
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4226
01:53:47.970 --> 01:53:49.640
<v Speaker 5>isn't that the real solution?</v>

4227
01:53:49.641 --> 01:53:51.900
<v Speaker 5>Is it everybody sort of realizes that they can't do it?</v>

4228
01:53:52.070 --> 01:53:52.251
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4229
01:53:52.251 --> 01:53:55.070
<v Speaker 5>but this is like one of the coolest things that's happened to me in,</v>

4230
01:53:55.090 --> 01:53:55.790
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

4231
01:53:55.790 --> 01:53:56.990
<v Speaker 5>in 30 years.</v>

4232
01:53:57.020 --> 01:53:58.670
<v Speaker 5>That was cooler than Fox magic.</v>

4233
01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:00.193
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4234
01:54:00.330 --> 01:54:01.163
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4235
01:54:02.490 --> 01:54:03.560
<v Speaker 5>You know who killed Tupac,</v>

4236
01:54:03.561 --> 01:54:04.394
<v Speaker 5>don't you?</v>

4237
01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:04.761
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4238
01:54:04.761 --> 01:54:05.600
<v Speaker 5>the cops did.</v>

4239
01:54:05.660 --> 01:54:05.901
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4240
01:54:05.901 --> 01:54:06.541
<v Speaker 5>There's a you ever,</v>

4241
01:54:06.541 --> 01:54:07.540
<v Speaker 5>you ever see that man?</v>

4242
01:54:07.541 --> 01:54:08.650
<v Speaker 5>Do you want to talk about corruption?</v>

4243
01:54:09.050 --> 01:54:09.990
<v Speaker 5>Terrifying story.</v>

4244
01:54:10.150 --> 01:54:10.983
<v Speaker 5>Even joke around.</v>

4245
01:54:11.160 --> 01:54:12.140
<v Speaker 5>We can do that all night,</v>

4246
01:54:12.141 --> 01:54:12.974
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>

4247
01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:13.220
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

4248
01:54:13.220 --> 01:54:14.540
<v Speaker 5>part the Rampart division.</v>

4249
01:54:16.250 --> 01:54:18.440
<v Speaker 5>I was going to say this is better than Fox magic.</v>

4250
01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:18.800
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

4251
01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:19.100
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4252
01:54:19.100 --> 01:54:19.641
<v Speaker 5>it's impossible.</v>

4253
01:54:19.641 --> 01:54:20.450
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

4254
01:54:20.450 --> 01:54:22.010
<v Speaker 5>Fox Mask makes you invisible.</v>

4255
01:54:22.070 --> 01:54:22.940
<v Speaker 5>What could be better than that?</v>

4256
01:54:22.990 --> 01:54:23.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4257
01:54:23.580 --> 01:54:24.500
<v Speaker 5>It's like one of the key.</v>

4258
01:54:24.501 --> 01:54:25.760
<v Speaker 5>If you could have a superpower,</v>

4259
01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:26.680
<v Speaker 5>what would you take?</v>

4260
01:54:26.680 --> 01:54:28.040
<v Speaker 5>If it sees two POCs needed?</v>

4261
01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:30.860
<v Speaker 5>Native American wisdom has taught me that if I am the wind,</v>

4262
01:54:30.861 --> 01:54:32.540
<v Speaker 5>it does not matter if people see me.</v>

4263
01:54:32.541 --> 01:54:33.900
<v Speaker 5>It only matters that the Pete,</v>

4264
01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:34.880
<v Speaker 5>that the leaves blow.</v>

4265
01:54:34.881 --> 01:54:35.714
<v Speaker 5>When I,</v>

4266
01:54:36.060 --> 01:54:36.893
<v Speaker 5>when I go by,</v>

4267
01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:38.263
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4268
01:54:38.300 --> 01:54:39.170
<v Speaker 5>that sounds tripping.</v>

4269
01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:40.910
<v Speaker 5>That sounds like again more shit.</v>

4270
01:54:40.911 --> 01:54:41.990
<v Speaker 5>You would tell the hippie chicks.</v>

4271
01:54:42.940 --> 01:54:43.773
<v Speaker 5>So anyway,</v>

4272
01:54:44.450 --> 01:54:45.070
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

4273
01:54:45.070 --> 01:54:47.410
<v Speaker 5>you guys are going to beat me up bro.</v>

4274
01:54:48.150 --> 01:54:51.680
<v Speaker 5>He's quoted a bet Midler song on my pocket the whole time he's been quoting to</v>

4275
01:54:51.690 --> 01:54:52.610
<v Speaker 5>bet Midler song.</v>

4276
01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:53.111
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

4277
01:54:53.111 --> 01:54:53.241
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

4278
01:54:53.241 --> 01:54:54.140
<v Speaker 5>this has a big joke.</v>

4279
01:54:54.530 --> 01:54:54.651
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4280
01:54:54.651 --> 01:54:56.750
<v Speaker 5>you remember when Herman Cain started quoting Pokemon?</v>

4281
01:54:57.140 --> 01:54:58.040
<v Speaker 5>I was like this,</v>

4282
01:54:58.160 --> 01:54:59.180
<v Speaker 5>this might be it fake.</v>

4283
01:54:59.330 --> 01:55:00.440
<v Speaker 5>This guy might not be real.</v>

4284
01:55:00.470 --> 01:55:01.790
<v Speaker 5>Do you think Herman Cain was really,</v>

4285
01:55:01.880 --> 01:55:03.950
<v Speaker 5>was he just in a position as a spoiler?</v>

4286
01:55:03.951 --> 01:55:06.650
<v Speaker 5>I mean it was Herman Cain was a hired sideshow.</v>

4287
01:55:06.860 --> 01:55:07.693
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

4288
01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:09.590
<v Speaker 5>I swear to God.</v>

4289
01:55:09.591 --> 01:55:10.940
<v Speaker 5>I know that sounds ridiculous.</v>

4290
01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:12.200
<v Speaker 5>I know it sounds ridiculous,</v>

4291
01:55:12.201 --> 01:55:15.620
<v Speaker 5>but when he started quoting Pokemon and using the fucking grand theft auto tax</v>

4292
01:55:15.800 --> 01:55:16.790
<v Speaker 5>tax program,</v>

4293
01:55:17.420 --> 01:55:18.080
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

4294
01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:18.351
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>

4295
01:55:18.351 --> 01:55:21.500
<v Speaker 5>a may have to create all this drama to make you believe that there is a</v>

01:55:58.551 --> 01:55:59.384
<v Speaker 4>It's a horrible story.</v>

4325
01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:01.800
<v Speaker 4>During the occupy Oakland,</v>

4326

01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:04.530
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4329
01:56:04.530 --> 01:56:05.330

01:56:05.330 --> 01:56:06.163
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4331
01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:10.040
<v Speaker 4>Scott Olson was one of several guys that were out front and he's,</v>

4332
01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:14.460
<v Speaker 4>he was military veteran and the cops were firing 40 millimeter flight,</v>

4333
01:56:14.461 --> 01:56:15.090
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4334
01:56:15.090 --> 01:56:17.040
<v Speaker 4>Projectiles out [inaudible] 79 bloopers.</v>

4335
01:56:17.041 --> 01:56:17.371
<v Speaker 4>I've shot.</v>

4336
01:56:17.371 --> 01:56:18.460
<v Speaker 4>Those are little grenade launchers.</v>

4337
01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:19.313
<v Speaker 4>They're kind of fun.</v>

4338
01:56:19.740 --> 01:56:20.101
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4339
01:56:20.101 --> 01:56:20.521
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

4340
01:56:20.521 --> 01:56:21.060
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

4341
01:56:21.060 --> 01:56:21.811
<v Speaker 4>somebody shot him in the head.</v>

4342
01:56:21.811 --> 01:56:22.644
<v Speaker 4>It was accidental.</v>

4343
01:56:22.830 --> 01:56:23.131
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4344
01:56:23.131 --> 01:56:26.010
<v Speaker 4>But after his skull was fractured and he was on the ground,</v>

4345
01:56:26.011 --> 01:56:29.580
<v Speaker 4>you see the cops lobbying a cs canisters,</v>

4346
01:56:29.620 --> 01:56:30.000
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4347
01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.340
<v Speaker 4>gas canisters right into the group of people.</v>

4348
01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:34.530
<v Speaker 4>And there was so much brutality.</v>

4349
01:56:34.531 --> 01:56:36.960
<v Speaker 4>And this was after watching the white shirts in New York,</v>

4350
01:56:37.470 --> 01:56:37.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4351
01:56:37.950 --> 01:56:38.341
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

4352
01:56:38.341 --> 01:56:40.200
<v Speaker 4>and Shamar Thomas hadn't come up yet.</v>

4353
01:56:40.230 --> 01:56:41.460
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he had yet.</v>

4354
01:56:42.130 --> 01:56:42.570
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4355
01:56:42.570 --> 01:56:45.240
<v Speaker 4>but we went to occupy Santa Rosa and it was like,</v>

4356
01:56:45.510 --> 01:56:46.050
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4357
01:56:46.050 --> 01:56:48.900
<v Speaker 4>which is the town close to where I lived in a town of about,</v>

4358
01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:49.530
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4359
01:56:49.530 --> 01:56:51.420
<v Speaker 4>we had the highest per capita turnout in the country.</v>

4360
01:56:51.780 --> 01:56:52.261
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4361
01:56:52.261 --> 01:56:54.120
<v Speaker 4>so we had like 3000 people turn out,</v>

4362
01:56:54.121 --> 01:56:56.700
<v Speaker 4>but we were going to put up camps and the chief of police had said,</v>

4363
01:56:56.701 --> 01:56:59.340
<v Speaker 4>we will use any means necessary to tear down the camp.</v>

4364
01:56:59.341 --> 01:57:00.810
<v Speaker 4>Now what happened was I went there and I said,</v>

4365
01:57:01.050 --> 01:57:02.070
<v Speaker 4>they're going to fuck these people.</v>

4366
01:57:02.071 --> 01:57:03.630
<v Speaker 4>I'm putting my body in front of them.</v>

4367
01:57:04.230 --> 01:57:06.510
<v Speaker 4>I took an oath and when I got there,</v>

4368
01:57:06.511 --> 01:57:07.950
<v Speaker 4>there were all these veterans,</v>

4369
01:57:08.580 --> 01:57:13.260
<v Speaker 4>there were Vietnam veterans and there were Gulf one veterans and there was one</v>

4370
01:57:13.261 --> 01:57:15.210
<v Speaker 4>active duty guy and it was an army ranger,</v>

4371
01:57:15.211 --> 01:57:16.350
<v Speaker 4>special forces medic.</v>

4372
01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:18.330
<v Speaker 4>And we had all showed up there with all,</v>

4373
01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:20.430
<v Speaker 4>we all had the same idea.</v>

4374
01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:25.530
<v Speaker 4>We are going to get in front of the cops so that when they start shooting the</v>

4375
01:57:25.531 --> 01:57:25.980
<v Speaker 4>gas,</v>

4376
01:57:25.980 --> 01:57:27.000
<v Speaker 4>they're going to hit us.</v>

4377
01:57:27.001 --> 01:57:28.560
<v Speaker 4>And if they want a beat on somebody,</v>

4378
01:57:28.620 --> 01:57:33.180
<v Speaker 4>let them beat on us because we know that we can take that without throwing back</v>

4379
01:57:34.930 --> 01:57:36.120
<v Speaker 4>to Jesus Christ.</v>

4380
01:57:36.530 --> 01:57:39.700
<v Speaker 4>And this groundswell from the veterans community,</v>

4381
01:57:39.780 --> 01:57:40.920
<v Speaker 4>Honorable Warriors,</v>

4382
01:57:40.921 --> 01:57:45.921
<v Speaker 4>the Shamar Thomas's you know what is so sad and I've had a really close</v>

4383
01:57:46.441 --> 01:57:49.560
<v Speaker 4>connection over the years from doing investigating murders,</v>

4384
01:57:49.561 --> 01:57:50.730
<v Speaker 4>have a lot of uh,</v>

4385
01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:52.440
<v Speaker 4>army special forces,</v>

4386
01:57:52.441 --> 01:57:53.580
<v Speaker 4>special OPS personnel.</v>

4387
01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:54.960
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4388
01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:59.960
<v Speaker 4>for all these years we have had really good men go off to war and never in my</v>

4389
01:58:01.501 --> 01:58:03.810
<v Speaker 4>war has lifetime has there been an honorable war.</v>

4390
01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:04.710
<v Speaker 4>Vietnam wasn't,</v>

4391
01:58:04.711 --> 01:58:05.580
<v Speaker 4>none of it was honored.</v>

4392
01:58:05.581 --> 01:58:06.720
<v Speaker 4>It was all crooked bullshit.</v>

4393
01:58:06.721 --> 01:58:09.660
<v Speaker 4>But there are guys who went out there who did the deed,</v>

4394
01:58:09.810 --> 01:58:11.280
<v Speaker 4>who put their lives on the line,</v>

4395
01:58:11.281 --> 01:58:12.570
<v Speaker 4>got their combat infantry badge,</v>

4396
01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:13.433
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

4397
01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:18.560

4398
01:58:19.441 --> 01:58:21.480
<v Speaker 4>never been able to shine like that.</v>

4399
01:58:21.780 --> 01:58:26.400
<v Speaker 4>And when Shamar Thomas did that Shamar Thomas was speaking for everybody who'd</v>

4400
01:58:26.401 --> 01:58:28.890
<v Speaker 4>been to war in this country's military,</v>

4446
01:59:32.650 --> 01:59:33.483
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

4449
01:59:39.581 --> 01:59:41.470
<v Speaker 3>And he became a teacher for me.</v>

4450
01:59:41.890 --> 01:59:42.830
<v Speaker 3>And he was one of the,</v>

4451
01:59:42.860 --> 01:59:43.200
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4452
01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:46.360
<v Speaker 3>the Great Warrior teachers that I've had who taught me about the power of honor</v>

4453

4454
01:59:49.180 --> 01:59:49.901
<v Speaker 3>not going to die.</v>

4582
02:02:32.321 --> 02:02:32.841
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>

4583
02:02:32.841 --> 02:02:35.000
<v Speaker 5>In my perception as a fool,</v>

4584
02:02:35.390 --> 02:02:36.320
<v Speaker 5>he's not one of us.</v>

4585
02:02:36.321 --> 02:02:37.154
<v Speaker 5>He's a,</v>

4586
02:02:37.820 --> 02:02:42.470
<v Speaker 5>this is a government of the banks by the banks and for the banks and Barack</v>

4587
02:02:42.470 --> 02:02:43.610
<v Speaker 5>Obama's presidential decisions,</v>

4588
02:02:43.611 --> 02:02:48.611
<v Speaker 5>especially since 2008 all of the sea has done was to make us pay for all of the</v>

4589
02:02:49.221 --> 02:02:50.960
<v Speaker 5>Wall Street crime he's,</v>

4590
02:02:51.110 --> 02:02:51.890
<v Speaker 5>they have,</v>

4591
02:02:51.890 --> 02:02:53.450
<v Speaker 5>they have taken all of that debt,</v>

4592
02:02:53.630 --> 02:02:54.231
<v Speaker 5>all the money.</v>

4593
02:02:54.231 --> 02:02:58.520
<v Speaker 5>They printed the derivatives and the bail out shit and they put it on our backs.</v>

4594
02:02:58.521 --> 02:03:01.670
<v Speaker 5>And that's what's happening around the world in Greece.</v>

4595
02:03:01.671 --> 02:03:03.230
<v Speaker 5>The banks now run the code.</v>

4596
02:03:03.230 --> 02:03:04.670
<v Speaker 5>There's a banker in charge of Greece,</v>

4597
02:03:04.671 --> 02:03:09.110
<v Speaker 5>there's a banker in charge of Italy and Barack Obama has done the same thing to</v>

4598
02:03:09.111 --> 02:03:09.321
<v Speaker 5>us.</v>

4599
02:03:09.321 --> 02:03:12.350
<v Speaker 5>And all that debt that belonged to Wall Street is now on our backs.</v>

4600
02:03:12.410 --> 02:03:15.920
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen the video where Barack Obama says that he believes he's the fourth</v>

4601
02:03:15.921 --> 02:03:16.790
<v Speaker 5>best president?</v>

4602
02:03:18.740 --> 02:03:19.460
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen it?</v>

4603
02:03:19.460 --> 02:03:19.911
<v Speaker 5>Oh God,</v>

4604
02:03:19.911 --> 02:03:20.140
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

4605
02:03:20.140 --> 02:03:20.973
<v Speaker 5>You see it in Brian.</v>

4606
02:03:21.170 --> 02:03:23.930
<v Speaker 5>Brian find it on Youtube and watch it cause it's hilarious.</v>

4607
02:03:24.050 --> 02:03:24.771
<v Speaker 5>He talks about,</v>

4608
02:03:24.771 --> 02:03:25.191
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4609
02:03:25.191 --> 02:03:29.360
<v Speaker 5>different presidents that have accomplished more and the only lists like three</v>

4610
02:03:29.480 --> 02:03:31.520
<v Speaker 5>that he thinks of accomplish more than they have.</v>

4611
02:03:31.730 --> 02:03:33.610
<v Speaker 5>There was a guy named Alexander soldier needs,</v>

4612
02:03:33.710 --> 02:03:35.480
<v Speaker 5>who was a Russian writer,</v>

4613
02:03:35.910 --> 02:03:37.460
<v Speaker 5>very great Russian writer.</v>

4614
02:03:37.461 --> 02:03:39.740
<v Speaker 5>He lived 30 years in a Gulag prison camp.</v>

4615
02:03:39.741 --> 02:03:40.574
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4616
02:03:40.620 --> 02:03:40.930
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

4617
02:03:40.930 --> 02:03:42.650
<v Speaker 5>and he came up with a great line.</v>

4618
02:03:42.651 --> 02:03:42.891
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

4619
02:03:42.891 --> 02:03:43.221
<v Speaker 5>men,</v>

4620
02:03:43.221 --> 02:03:46.910
<v Speaker 5>in order to do evil must first believe that what they are doing is good.</v>

4621
02:03:47.060 --> 02:03:47.870
<v Speaker 5>Wow,</v>

4622
02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:48.740
<v Speaker 5>that's incredible.</v>

4623
02:03:48.770 --> 02:03:53.770
<v Speaker 5>So you convince yourself that we're the elite,</v>

4624
02:03:54.050 --> 02:03:58.220
<v Speaker 5>where the rich we have the only way to manage things we have to do to that and</v>

4625
02:03:58.221 --> 02:03:59.870
<v Speaker 5>they delude themselves.</v>

4626
02:03:59.871 --> 02:04:00.560
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

4627
02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:01.670
<v Speaker 5>that's the Fed,</v>

4628
02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:02.570
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4629
02:04:02.570 --> 02:04:07.310
<v Speaker 5>stale nature of a democracy that has not been ventilated and breathe and air it</v>

4630
02:04:07.311 --> 02:04:08.570
<v Speaker 5>out for a long time,</v>

4631
02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:09.800
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4632
02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:11.900
<v Speaker 5>and die.</v>

4633
02:04:11.901 --> 02:04:14.480
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to save this system at all as far as I'm concerned.</v>

4634
02:04:14.690 --> 02:04:17.900
<v Speaker 5>And especially what the end of energy with W.</v>

4635
02:04:17.900 --> 02:04:17.901
<v Speaker 5>Dot.</v>

4636
02:04:17.901 --> 02:04:20.090
<v Speaker 5>The endo w with peak oil and collapsed,</v>

4637
02:04:20.220 --> 02:04:22.430
<v Speaker 5>the United States can't possibly hold together anyway.</v>

4638
02:04:22.850 --> 02:04:27.850
<v Speaker 5>So when peak oil happens in gas becomes extremely expensive and probably</v>

4639
02:04:28.250 --> 02:04:29.630
<v Speaker 5>impossible to get,</v>

4640
02:04:29.900 --> 02:04:30.830
<v Speaker 5>then what happens?</v>

4641
02:04:30.860 --> 02:04:35.450
<v Speaker 5>We often branch off into little communities and make our own medicine was solar</v>

4642
02:04:35.451 --> 02:04:35.811
<v Speaker 5>power.</v>

4643
02:04:35.811 --> 02:04:35.991
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4644
02:04:35.991 --> 02:04:38.160
<v Speaker 5>what are we gonna do with those of us who were smart</v>

4645
02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:40.410
<v Speaker 3>enough to start moving in that direction ahead of time?</v>

4646
02:04:40.411 --> 02:04:41.244
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

4647
02:04:41.340 --> 02:04:46.340
<v Speaker 3>But peak oil has already happened and there are in this country with all of the</v>

4648
02:04:47.070 --> 02:04:48.750
<v Speaker 3>tens and hundreds of millions of people who are unemployed or below the poverty</v>

4649
02:04:48.751 --> 02:04:48.961
<v Speaker 3>line,</v>

4650
02:04:48.961 --> 02:04:51.330
<v Speaker 3>people who can't afford gas at any price right now.</v>

4651
02:04:53.130 --> 02:04:54.780
<v Speaker 6>So it's going to slowly keep creeping.</v>

4652
02:04:54.990 --> 02:04:55.800
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4653
02:04:55.800 --> 02:04:56.251
<v Speaker 6>And that really,</v>

4654
02:04:56.251 --> 02:04:57.001
<v Speaker 6>when we think about it,</v>

4655
02:04:57.001 --> 02:04:59.850
<v Speaker 6>the real big jump was the end of the Bush administration,</v>

4656
02:04:59.851 --> 02:05:01.110
<v Speaker 6>which was only a few years ago.</v>

4657
02:05:01.140 --> 02:05:02.760
<v Speaker 6>That's nothing a blink of the eye,</v>

4658
02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:03.860
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

4659
02:05:03.860 --> 02:05:04.020
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4660
02:05:04.020 --> 02:05:07.890
<v Speaker 6>they knew it was coming to think of how bad it could be three years from now.</v>

4661
02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:09.810
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

4662
02:05:09.810 --> 02:05:12.420
<v Speaker 3>Well that's good because again,</v>

4663
02:05:12.450 --> 02:05:14.970
<v Speaker 3>we all wind claim here is progress rather than perfection.</v>

4664
02:05:14.971 --> 02:05:16.800
<v Speaker 3>There's not not ready and then ready.</v>

4665
02:05:16.830 --> 02:05:17.101
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4666
02:05:17.101 --> 02:05:18.330
<v Speaker 3>you're not in a binary state.</v>

4667
02:05:18.410 --> 02:05:19.191
<v Speaker 6>Do you subscribe?</v>

4668
02:05:19.191 --> 02:05:19.311
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

4669
02:05:19.311 --> 02:05:20.150
<v Speaker 6>We talked about earlier,</v>

4670
02:05:20.151 --> 02:05:21.440
<v Speaker 6>but do you subscribe to the,</v>

4671
02:05:21.441 --> 02:05:23.630
<v Speaker 6>the Mayans ideas you think they were on to something?</v>

4672
02:05:23.850 --> 02:05:25.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm amazed at the coincidence.</v>

4673
02:05:25.260 --> 02:05:25.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4674
02:05:25.690 --> 02:05:26.131
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>

4675
02:05:26.131 --> 02:05:26.311
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4676
02:05:26.311 --> 02:05:27.210
<v Speaker 3>I think there is,</v>

4677
02:05:27.211 --> 02:05:28.044
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4678
02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:30.540
<v Speaker 3>everything else in this world we look at now is a lie.</v>

4679
02:05:30.900 --> 02:05:31.260
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

4680
02:05:31.260 --> 02:05:31.590
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>

4681
02:05:31.590 --> 02:05:32.423
<v Speaker 3>It's a lie.</v>

4682
02:05:33.090 --> 02:05:34.050
<v Speaker 3>There's a recovery.</v>

4683
02:05:34.240 --> 02:05:35.073
<v Speaker 3>It's a lie.</v>

4684
02:05:35.210 --> 02:05:35.430
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4685
02:05:35.430 --> 02:05:36.840
<v Speaker 3>we killed the Osama bin.</v>

4686
02:05:36.841 --> 02:05:39.510
<v Speaker 3>Ladin it's a lie around was behind nine 11.</v>

4687
02:05:39.570 --> 02:05:40.403
<v Speaker 3>It's a lie,</v>

4688
02:05:40.680 --> 02:05:41.041
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4689
02:05:41.041 --> 02:05:41.611
<v Speaker 3>Wall Street,</v>

4690
02:05:41.611 --> 02:05:42.151
<v Speaker 3>it's a lie.</v>

4691
02:05:42.151 --> 02:05:42.900
<v Speaker 3>Your pension fund,</v>

4692
02:05:42.900 --> 02:05:44.130
<v Speaker 3>it's a lie that,</v>

4693
02:05:44.220 --> 02:05:44.521
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

4694
02:05:44.521 --> 02:05:45.540
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>

4695
02:05:46.710 --> 02:05:50.100
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff just needs to be seen what it is and disengage from it.</v>

4696
02:05:50.640 --> 02:05:53.010
<v Speaker 3>It's kinds of mass destruction.</v>

4697
02:05:53.860 --> 02:05:57.210
<v Speaker 3>It's codependent to want to go in and fix that system.</v>

4698
02:05:57.211 --> 02:05:59.500
<v Speaker 3>It's picture somebody wanting to go to uh,</v>

4699
02:05:59.820 --> 02:06:02.730
<v Speaker 3>the Nazis in 1938 and saying,</v>

4700
02:06:02.731 --> 02:06:03.031
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

4701
02:06:03.031 --> 02:06:06.330
<v Speaker 3>let's have a campaign to organize the teach the Nazis that the Jews are really</v>

4702
02:06:06.331 --> 02:06:07.164
<v Speaker 3>good people,</v>

4703
02:06:07.260 --> 02:06:07.951
<v Speaker 3>the smart people.</v>

4704
02:06:07.951 --> 02:06:08.491
<v Speaker 3>We're just saying,</v>

4705
02:06:08.491 --> 02:06:09.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting the fuck out of Europe.</v>

4706
02:06:10.290 --> 02:06:10.860
<v Speaker 3>The Jews,</v>

4707
02:06:10.860 --> 02:06:11.730
<v Speaker 3>smart Jews were getting,</v>

4708
02:06:11.731 --> 02:06:11.941
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4709
02:06:11.941 --> 02:06:15.780
<v Speaker 3>getting out of the way the world knew what was coming with that and it's,</v>

4710
02:06:15.850 --> 02:06:18.960
<v Speaker 3>and it's not mentally sound to try and fix this system.</v>

4711
02:06:18.980 --> 02:06:19.110
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

4712
02:06:19.110 --> 02:06:21.000
<v Speaker 3>this system needs to be redone.</v>

4713
02:06:21.480 --> 02:06:25.470
<v Speaker 3>Ron Paul's got a good end and the Fed you got until you change the way money</v>

4714
02:06:25.471 --> 02:06:25.741
<v Speaker 3>works,</v>

4715
02:06:25.741 --> 02:06:26.520
<v Speaker 3>you change nothing.</v>

4716
02:06:26.520 --> 02:06:27.540
<v Speaker 3>That's the big start.</v>

4717
02:06:27.541 --> 02:06:31.080
<v Speaker 3>Then you gotta and fractional reserve banking compound interest in Fiat</v>

4718
02:06:31.081 --> 02:06:31.914
<v Speaker 3>currency.</v>

4719
02:06:32.160 --> 02:06:32.940
<v Speaker 6>What is the,</v>

4720
02:06:32.940 --> 02:06:36.000
<v Speaker 6>what's the solution when you have to do something to put something else in</v>

4721
02:06:36.001 --> 02:06:36.834
<v Speaker 6>place?</v>

4722
02:06:36.900 --> 02:06:37.560

<v Speaker 8>Steve.</v>

4736

<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4737
02:06:50.410 --> 02:06:54.940
<v Speaker 8>I would put our legislative and foreign policy accomplishments in our first two</v>

4738
02:06:54.941 --> 02:06:56.260
<v Speaker 8>years against any president,</v>

4739

<v Speaker 6>dude.</v>

4753
02:07:11.880 --> 02:07:14.940
<v Speaker 6>He got the Nobel prize after these and then you sent 30,000 more people out to</v>

4754
02:07:14.941 --> 02:07:16.260
<v Speaker 6>Afghanistan with,</v>

4755
02:07:16.540 --> 02:07:16.850
<v Speaker 6>with,</v>

4756
02:07:16.850 --> 02:07:17.641
<v Speaker 6>with guns.</v>

4757
02:07:17.641 --> 02:07:17.891
<v Speaker 6>He's,</v>

4758
02:07:17.891 --> 02:07:18.661
<v Speaker 6>he's Hanks.</v>

4759
02:07:18.661 --> 02:07:20.360
<v Speaker 6>He's bloodier than chain Bush.</v>

4760
02:07:20.390 --> 02:07:20.911
<v Speaker 6>It's amazing.</v>

4761
02:07:20.911 --> 02:07:22.670
<v Speaker 6>It's amazing that he could actually say that though.</v>

4762
02:07:22.710 --> 02:07:22.931
<v Speaker 6>What,</v>

4763
02:07:22.931 --> 02:07:23.151
<v Speaker 6>what,</v>

4764
02:07:23.151 --> 02:07:24.210
<v Speaker 6>what legislation?</v>

4765
02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:24.391
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

4766
02:07:24.391 --> 02:07:26.010
<v Speaker 6>you mean you know the,</v>

4767
02:07:26.020 --> 02:07:29.140
<v Speaker 6>the ability to just start arresting people for no fucking reason would it?</v>

4768
02:07:29.150 --> 02:07:30.780
<v Speaker 6>What is it exactly that got accomplished?</v>

4769
02:07:30.810 --> 02:07:31.643
<v Speaker 6>Did I miss something?</v>

4770
02:07:31.950 --> 02:07:32.450
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4771
02:07:32.450 --> 02:07:32.670
<v Speaker 6>What,</v>

4772
02:07:32.670 --> 02:07:35.470
<v Speaker 6>what are these great legislation of achievements?</v>

4773
02:07:35.560 --> 02:07:38.500
<v Speaker 6>Do you know what he's talking about and know what the fuck could he be talking</v>

4774
02:07:38.501 --> 02:07:38.800
<v Speaker 6>about?</v>

4775
02:07:38.800 --> 02:07:42.510
<v Speaker 6>That's the Orwellian nature of this absolute crap we see on the,</v>

4776
02:07:42.511 --> 02:07:45.070
<v Speaker 6>on the mainstream airways horseshoe this whole time.</v>

4777
02:07:45.071 --> 02:07:46.330
<v Speaker 6>It's like some precedent thing like,</v>

4778
02:07:46.331 --> 02:07:47.164
<v Speaker 6>oh yeah,</v>

4779
02:07:47.270 --> 02:07:47.740
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>

4780
02:07:47.740 --> 02:07:50.500
<v Speaker 6>Nevermind what I'll tell you dude.</v>

4781
02:07:50.770 --> 02:07:51.100
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

4782
02:07:51.100 --> 02:07:52.450
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what the fuck you just said Brian.</v>

4783
02:07:53.350 --> 02:07:53.980
<v Speaker 6>Nevermind.</v>

4784
02:07:53.980 --> 02:07:54.550
<v Speaker 6>That's okay.</v>

4785
02:07:54.550 --> 02:07:55.120
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4786
02:07:55.120 --> 02:07:55.953
<v Speaker 6>he's a silly boy.</v>

4787
02:07:56.100 --> 02:07:56.560
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4788
02:07:56.560 --> 02:07:59.050
<v Speaker 6>so you know all that stuff.</v>

4789
02:07:59.150 --> 02:08:00.970
<v Speaker 6>It just needs to stop.</v>

4790
02:08:02.440 --> 02:08:03.580
<v Speaker 6>So like I said,</v>

4791
02:08:03.581 --> 02:08:05.260
<v Speaker 6>you predicted a lot of shit.</v>

4792
02:08:05.261 --> 02:08:05.501
<v Speaker 6>You,</v>

4793
02:08:05.501 --> 02:08:05.801
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

4794
02:08:05.801 --> 02:08:06.280
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

4795
02:08:06.280 --> 02:08:08.100
<v Speaker 6>you been at the firm,</v>

4796
02:08:08.160 --> 02:08:08.530
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4797
02:08:08.530 --> 02:08:09.880
<v Speaker 6>I forget when it was,</v>

4798
02:08:09.881 --> 02:08:10.714
<v Speaker 6>when you,</v>

4799
02:08:10.750 --> 02:08:14.610
<v Speaker 6>when you started predicting that our society was slowly going to collapse.</v>

4800
02:08:14.620 --> 02:08:16.740
<v Speaker 6>It was like way before anybody else was ever doing it.</v>

4801
02:08:16.750 --> 02:08:18.190
<v Speaker 6>That was in one was when I first started.</v>

4802
02:08:18.250 --> 02:08:20.680
<v Speaker 6>What do you think is going to be 99 point?</v>

4803
02:08:20.740 --> 02:08:22.180
<v Speaker 6>The end point is going to be,</v>

4804
02:08:22.210 --> 02:08:22.811
<v Speaker 6>is it going to be,</v>

4805
02:08:22.811 --> 02:08:26.200
<v Speaker 6>we find groups of people and we hang out together and grow food?</v>

4806
02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:26.680
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4807
02:08:26.680 --> 02:08:27.510
<v Speaker 4>that does.</v>

4808
02:08:27.510 --> 02:08:27.841
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4809
02:08:27.841 --> 02:08:31.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm probably more grateful for that question Joe than any other one because</v>

4810
02:08:31.441 --> 02:08:34.350
<v Speaker 4>that's what we're fighting about now.</v>

4811
02:08:34.380 --> 02:08:36.180
<v Speaker 4>When we want to get Ron Paul elected,</v>

4812
02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:37.560
<v Speaker 4>that's what we're fighting about.</v>

4813
02:08:37.860 --> 02:08:41.760
<v Speaker 4>It stops when the people wake up to the point and says,</v>

4814
02:08:42.210 --> 02:08:43.050
<v Speaker 4>this has got to stop.</v>

4815
02:08:43.100 --> 02:08:45.620
<v Speaker 6>Because if you can get a guy like Ron Paul in office,</v>

4816
02:08:45.621 --> 02:08:48.650
<v Speaker 6>you think we can kind of smooth everything out and still have cars.</v>

4817
02:08:48.680 --> 02:08:49.220
<v Speaker 6>He uh,</v>

4818
02:08:49.220 --> 02:08:50.053
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

4819
02:08:50.710 --> 02:08:51.290
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

4820
02:08:51.290 --> 02:08:52.400
<v Speaker 6>we will still have cars.</v>

4821
02:08:52.401 --> 02:08:54.770
<v Speaker 6>Even if we have bio diesel run on,</v>

4822
02:08:54.800 --> 02:08:55.770
<v Speaker 6>or even if we have,</v>

4823
02:08:55.830 --> 02:08:56.663
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4824
02:08:58.170 --> 02:08:59.670
<v Speaker 4>some of the criminal in the White House,</v>

4825
02:08:59.740 --> 02:09:00.573
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4826
02:09:00.810 --> 02:09:01.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4827
02:09:01.580 --> 02:09:03.400
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

4828
02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:03.740
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

4829
02:09:03.740 --> 02:09:05.310
<v Speaker 4>they're going to become harder to find,</v>

4830
02:09:06.180 --> 02:09:11.180
<v Speaker 4>but we're fighting to determine how far this system is going to run everything</v>

4831
02:09:12.601 --> 02:09:15.330
<v Speaker 4>down before we put our foot down and say,</v>

4832
02:09:15.331 --> 02:09:16.500
<v Speaker 4>this has got to change.</v>

4833
02:09:17.010 --> 02:09:19.710
<v Speaker 4>That's what's gonna make the difference because this system,</v>

4834
02:09:20.340 --> 02:09:23.850
<v Speaker 4>I wrote an essay called Global Court some years ago,</v>

4835
02:09:23.851 --> 02:09:24.720
<v Speaker 4>and in it I said,</v>

4836
02:09:24.721 --> 02:09:25.620
<v Speaker 4>the way the system works,</v>

4837
02:09:25.640 --> 02:09:26.191
<v Speaker 4>infinite growth,</v>

4838
02:09:26.191 --> 02:09:26.851
<v Speaker 4>mergers and everything.</v>

4839
02:09:26.851 --> 02:09:27.684
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

4840
02:09:27.930 --> 02:09:31.260
<v Speaker 4>the last CFO of the last corporation in the world,</v>

4841
02:09:31.500 --> 02:09:32.280
<v Speaker 4>Global Corp,</v>

4842
02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:34.020
<v Speaker 4>when the world is in total ruins,</v>

4843
02:09:34.050 --> 02:09:34.980
<v Speaker 4>when four or five,</v>

4844
02:09:34.981 --> 02:09:36.570
<v Speaker 4>6 billion people are dead,</v>

4845
02:09:36.900 --> 02:09:41.190
<v Speaker 4>when one guy has acquired all the ones and Zeros of wealth and that company goes</v>

4846
02:09:41.191 --> 02:09:41.731
<v Speaker 4>bankrupt,</v>

4847
02:09:41.731 --> 02:09:42.271
<v Speaker 4>he's going to say,</v>

4848
02:09:42.271 --> 02:09:42.661
<v Speaker 4>hooray,</v>

4849
02:09:42.661 --> 02:09:43.494
<v Speaker 4>we did it.</v>

4850
02:09:43.800 --> 02:09:47.460
<v Speaker 4>That's where that ends until and unless we stop it,</v>

4851
02:09:47.580 --> 02:09:49.890
<v Speaker 4>human beings stop it.</v>

4852
02:09:50.340 --> 02:09:54.570
<v Speaker 4>And the consciousness is here that understands that the infinite growth economic</v>

4853
02:09:54.571 --> 02:09:57.750
<v Speaker 4>paradigm will kill us in order to make a profit.</v>

4854
02:09:58.500 --> 02:09:59.430
<v Speaker 4>How much time do we have?</v>

4855
02:10:00.450 --> 02:10:00.901
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4856
02:10:00.901 --> 02:10:01.530
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

4857
02:10:01.530 --> 02:10:01.861
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4858
02:10:01.861 --> 02:10:02.580
<v Speaker 4>if there,</v>

4859
02:10:02.580 --> 02:10:06.390
<v Speaker 4>if there's an attack launched on Iran within the next week or two B or before</v>

4860
02:10:06.391 --> 02:10:07.270
<v Speaker 4>the Iowa third,</v>

4861
02:10:07.740 --> 02:10:08.200
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>

4862
02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:09.001

4863
02:10:09.001 --> 02:10:13.650
<v Speaker 4>I will caucuses and China comes into backup Iran and the Russians have said they</v>

4864
02:10:13.651 --> 02:10:14.450
<v Speaker 4>will back up a,</v>

4865
02:10:14.450 --> 02:10:15.810
<v Speaker 4>a nuclear weapons or exchange.</v>

4866
02:10:15.811 --> 02:10:17.130
<v Speaker 4>It could be over in two weeks.</v>

4867
02:10:17.230 --> 02:10:18.670
<v Speaker 6>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

4868
02:10:18.700 --> 02:10:19.511
<v Speaker 6>I got shit to do.</v>

4869
02:10:19.511 --> 02:10:19.751
<v Speaker 6>Dude.</v>

4870
02:10:19.751 --> 02:10:21.130
<v Speaker 6>I have a new special to make,</v>

4871
02:10:22.060 --> 02:10:24.940
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to release it like Louis C k look,</v>

4872
02:10:24.970 --> 02:10:25.803
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4873
02:10:25.930 --> 02:10:27.400
<v Speaker 6>this is very frightening stuff.</v>

4874
02:10:27.430 --> 02:10:28.750
<v Speaker 6>You think this is unavoidable?</v>

4875
02:10:28.751 --> 02:10:31.150
<v Speaker 6>You think that a nuclear war with Iran is just,</v>

4876
02:10:31.151 --> 02:10:31.984
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

4877
02:10:32.070 --> 02:10:32.771
<v Speaker 6>I don't.</v>

4878
02:10:32.771 --> 02:10:33.980
<v Speaker 6>And seeing very strong</v>

4879
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:34.460
<v Speaker 4>signs that,</v>

4880
02:10:34.460 --> 02:10:34.921
<v Speaker 4>that uh,</v>

4881
02:10:34.921 --> 02:10:37.220
<v Speaker 4>the United States is getting bitch slapped around the world right now.</v>

4882
02:10:37.820 --> 02:10:38.150
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4883
02:10:38.150 --> 02:10:38.690
<v Speaker 4>since we,</v>

4884
02:10:38.690 --> 02:10:40.610
<v Speaker 4>since we killed 24 Pakistani troops,</v>

4885
02:10:40.611 --> 02:10:44.150
<v Speaker 4>I sat hilos killed 24 packs soldiers,</v>

4886
02:10:44.750 --> 02:10:45.583
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4887
02:10:45.620 --> 02:10:49.160
<v Speaker 4>all of the supplies going into the NATO forces in Afghanistan had been cut off</v>

4888
02:10:49.161 --> 02:10:49.994
<v Speaker 4>through Pakistan.</v>

4889
02:10:50.050 --> 02:10:52.940
<v Speaker 6>How ridiculous was the asking for the drone back from my Iran?</v>

4890
02:10:53.590 --> 02:10:56.560
<v Speaker 6>Did that make you feel like it's a work of fiction when you saw that?</v>

4891
02:10:57.390 --> 02:11:00.220
<v Speaker 6>Fubar it's just foobar it's just nuts.</v>

4892
02:11:00.221 --> 02:11:03.700
<v Speaker 6>Save and asked him to go on TV and say that we asked for it back.</v>

4893
02:11:03.730 --> 02:11:04.900
<v Speaker 6>They told Obama to do that.</v>

4894
02:11:05.050 --> 02:11:08.290
<v Speaker 6>It's almost like they're making him out to be a buffoon and towards his last</v>

4895
02:11:08.290 --> 02:11:08.590
<v Speaker 6>couple of years,</v>

4896
02:11:08.590 --> 02:11:09.490
<v Speaker 6>this is your script.</v>

4897
02:11:09.570 --> 02:11:10.271
<v Speaker 6>This is what I want you to do.</v>

4898
02:11:10.271 --> 02:11:13.120
<v Speaker 6>I want you to go out there and when they say about the the drone,</v>

4899
02:11:13.121 --> 02:11:14.230
<v Speaker 6>just say we asked for it back.</v>

4900
02:11:14.980 --> 02:11:15.461
<v Speaker 6>He's probably like,</v>

4901
02:11:15.461 --> 02:11:16.630
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck am I going to say?</v>

4902
02:11:17.310 --> 02:11:18.640
<v Speaker 6>It's like a sitcom actor.</v>

4903
02:11:18.641 --> 02:11:19.840
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't want to be humiliated.</v>

4904
02:11:19.960 --> 02:11:21.100
<v Speaker 6>Some shit line.</v>

4905
02:11:21.430 --> 02:11:22.360
<v Speaker 6>This is a bullshit line.</v>

4906
02:11:23.430 --> 02:11:27.080
<v Speaker 4>Expect it to be a lot more nonsensical all the way from here on out.</v>

4907
02:11:27.160 --> 02:11:30.160
<v Speaker 6>And the only way to avoid this is to have a guy like Ron Paul and office.</v>

4908
02:11:30.161 --> 02:11:31.930
<v Speaker 6>It's the only to avoid going to war with Iran.</v>

4909
02:11:31.931 --> 02:11:32.950
<v Speaker 6>Know How do we avoid it?</v>

4910
02:11:33.010 --> 02:11:37.660
<v Speaker 4>Because the occupy movement is demonstrating that you've had 100,000 people out</v>

4911
02:11:37.661 --> 02:11:38.770
<v Speaker 4>in the streets of Moscow.</v>

4912
02:11:39.100 --> 02:11:42.910
<v Speaker 4>There's an occupy related occupy inspired revolt in the village of Uconn in</v>

4913
02:11:42.911 --> 02:11:43.744
<v Speaker 4>southern China,</v>

4914
02:11:43.930 --> 02:11:44.650
<v Speaker 4>which has made,</v>

4915
02:11:44.650 --> 02:11:47.620
<v Speaker 4>made the Chinese communist government backed down.</v>

4916
02:11:47.890 --> 02:11:48.490
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>

4917
02:11:48.490 --> 02:11:48.821
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

4918
02:11:48.821 --> 02:11:50.320
<v Speaker 4>it's not communist versus capitalist.</v>

4919
02:11:50.330 --> 02:11:52.510
<v Speaker 4>It's all money in banks and growth and all that stuff.</v>

4920
02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:53.161
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

4921
02:11:53.161 --> 02:11:56.770
<v Speaker 4>and this is a growing wave of consciousness that's magic.</v>

4922
02:11:57.190 --> 02:12:01.030
<v Speaker 4>And that's why there's a lot of days when I walk around and lately and I see</v>

4923
02:12:01.031 --> 02:12:02.470
<v Speaker 4>things happen and I'm just giggling.</v>

4924
02:12:02.670 --> 02:12:03.570
<v Speaker 6>So you love this.</v>

4925
02:12:03.571 --> 02:12:04.440
<v Speaker 6>This is fun for you.</v>

4926
02:12:04.470 --> 02:12:04.980
<v Speaker 6>You,</v>

4927
02:12:04.980 --> 02:12:05.161
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

4928
02:12:05.161 --> 02:12:05.521
<v Speaker 6>first of all,</v>

4929
02:12:05.521 --> 02:12:06.450
<v Speaker 6>you've been first.</v>

4930
02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:07.171
<v Speaker 6>First of all,</v>

4931
02:12:07.171 --> 02:12:09.300
<v Speaker 6>you've been predicting it for a long time.</v>

4932
02:12:09.301 --> 02:12:11.040
<v Speaker 6>So while it's happening you like,</v>

4933
02:12:11.160 --> 02:12:14.250
<v Speaker 6>see I fucking told you there's a lot of that,</v>

4934
02:12:14.280 --> 02:12:15.113
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4935
02:12:15.150 --> 02:12:15.811
<v Speaker 6>But there's also,</v>

4936
02:12:15.811 --> 02:12:17.670
<v Speaker 6>you're happy to see the system fall apart.</v>

4937
02:12:17.671 --> 02:12:18.990
<v Speaker 6>Not because you want people to die,</v>

4938
02:12:18.991 --> 02:12:22.010
<v Speaker 6>but because it's a fucked up system that doesn't work and it needs to dialing</v>

4939
02:12:22.020 --> 02:12:22.920
<v Speaker 6>anything that doesn't work.</v>

4940
02:12:22.950 --> 02:12:23.400
<v Speaker 6>Let me make it</v>

4941
02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:23.851
<v Speaker 4>very clear.</v>

4942
02:12:23.851 --> 02:12:27.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing everything I possibly can to accelerate the breakdown.</v>

4943
02:12:27.121 --> 02:12:28.760
<v Speaker 4>If the United States government and and,</v>

4944
02:12:28.761 --> 02:12:29.130
<v Speaker 4>and the,</v>

4945
02:12:29.130 --> 02:12:31.500
<v Speaker 4>and the economy and the banking system and everything else.</v>

4946
02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:31.711
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

4947
02:12:31.711 --> 02:12:32.461
<v Speaker 6>under the Patriot Act,</v>

4948
02:12:32.461 --> 02:12:33.780
<v Speaker 6>are you allowed to say shit like that?</v>

4949
02:12:33.810 --> 02:12:35.490
<v Speaker 6>Like getting can't that could be,</v>

4950
02:12:35.910 --> 02:12:38.220
<v Speaker 6>could that be interpreted as you're a threat?</v>

4951
02:12:38.450 --> 02:12:41.930
<v Speaker 4>Only God determines what I'm allowed to say and nobody else has the right to do</v>

4952
02:12:41.931 --> 02:12:42.570
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

4953
02:12:42.570 --> 02:12:44.040
<v Speaker 6>And isn't it supposed to be enemies?</v>

4954
02:12:44.041 --> 02:12:45.480
<v Speaker 6>Both foreign and domestic?</v>

4955
02:12:45.690 --> 02:12:46.320
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

4956
02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:47.310
<v Speaker 6>Who forgot that?</v>

4957
02:12:47.311 --> 02:12:48.480
<v Speaker 6>How come everybody forgot that?</v>

4958
02:12:48.830 --> 02:12:49.020
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4959
02:12:49.020 --> 02:12:50.130
<v Speaker 6>the foreign and domestic,</v>

4960
02:12:50.230 --> 02:12:51.210
<v Speaker 4>that's the beauty of,</v>

4961
02:12:51.460 --> 02:12:53.620
<v Speaker 4>of what Aki and all these veterans showing up.</v>

4962
02:12:53.621 --> 02:12:54.431
<v Speaker 4>Captain Ray Lewis,</v>

4963
02:12:54.431 --> 02:12:58.930
<v Speaker 4>the Philadelphia police captain who showed up in his uniform and got arrested at</v>

4964
02:12:58.931 --> 02:12:59.764
<v Speaker 4>Ducati.</v>

4965
02:13:00.090 --> 02:13:05.090
<v Speaker 4>There's W W we're stepping up by the thousands all over the country and we're</v>

4966
02:13:05.201 --> 02:13:07.360
<v Speaker 4>making ourselves known throughout the movement.</v>

4967
02:13:07.510 --> 02:13:11.740
<v Speaker 4>And what we're discovering is there's lots of us out here and we are not going</v>

4968
02:13:11.741 --> 02:13:12.700
<v Speaker 4>to let this go down.</v>

4969
02:13:12.730 --> 02:13:13.960
<v Speaker 4>And if the,</v>

4970
02:13:13.961 --> 02:13:14.500
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4971
02:13:14.500 --> 02:13:18.010
<v Speaker 4>detention provisions are passed at NDA and they're employed,</v>

4972
02:13:18.130 --> 02:13:19.000
<v Speaker 4>you're going to see,</v>

4973
02:13:19.090 --> 02:13:22.180
<v Speaker 4>you're going to see massive breakdowns because there's got to be soldiers in</v>

4974
02:13:22.181 --> 02:13:23.080
<v Speaker 4>this country that won't fight.</v>

4975
02:13:23.081 --> 02:13:25.600
<v Speaker 4>There's got to be cops that will stand with the people.</v>

4976
02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:29.770
<v Speaker 4>Five county sheriffs in northern California have United and county sheriffs are</v>

4977
02:13:29.771 --> 02:13:31.000
<v Speaker 4>the most powerful dudes in the,</v>

4978
02:13:31.740 --> 02:13:32.040
<v Speaker 4>they can</v>

4979
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:35.550
<v Speaker 5>tell the president to stay out of the county legally and the president can't say</v>

4980
02:13:35.551 --> 02:13:36.384
<v Speaker 5>Jack about it.</v>

4981
02:13:36.670 --> 02:13:37.170
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4982
02:13:37.170 --> 02:13:38.330
<v Speaker 5>isn't that changed as you,</v>

4983
02:13:38.390 --> 02:13:40.260
<v Speaker 5>they probably just changed that with the NDA.</v>

4984
02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:42.210
<v Speaker 5>They probably just changed that with something,</v>

4985
02:13:42.211 --> 02:13:45.630
<v Speaker 5>some sneaky bill they stuck through and yet it doesn't matter.</v>

4986
02:13:45.660 --> 02:13:48.360
<v Speaker 5>Once they bring the military and it's illegal to grow food.</v>

4987
02:13:48.540 --> 02:13:49.860
<v Speaker 5>You guys said to plant your own food.</v>

4988
02:13:49.861 --> 02:13:53.300
<v Speaker 5>Did you note that that one bill passed that that makes it illegal to Predix?</v>

4989
02:13:53.380 --> 02:13:54.213
<v Speaker 5>Why isn't food?</v>

4990
02:13:54.330 --> 02:13:54.541
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4991
02:13:54.541 --> 02:13:54.880
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4992
02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:59.880
<v Speaker 5>there are some laws that that restricts some people's ability in some places to</v>

4993
02:14:01.110 --> 02:14:01.790
<v Speaker 5>grow food.</v>

4994
02:14:01.790 --> 02:14:01.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4995
02:14:01.970 --> 02:14:02.830
<v Speaker 5>If a dude farts a lot,</v>

4996
02:14:02.831 --> 02:14:05.220
<v Speaker 5>you can't be grown broccoli in your backyard,</v>

4997
02:14:05.430 --> 02:14:09.300
<v Speaker 5>but the real base or the FDA and so forth to come in and say you can't drink raw</v>

4998
02:14:09.301 --> 02:14:09.571
<v Speaker 5>milk,</v>

4999
02:14:09.571 --> 02:14:10.291
<v Speaker 5>which is awesome.</v>

5000
02:14:10.291 --> 02:14:12.750
<v Speaker 5>I love raw mill Roman cause delicious and they stopped that.</v>

5001
02:14:12.990 --> 02:14:14.070
<v Speaker 5>They used to get it at whole foods.</v>

5002
02:14:14.071 --> 02:14:14.904
<v Speaker 5>They don't have it anymore.</v>

5003
02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:16.140
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

5004
02:14:16.140 --> 02:14:17.580
<v Speaker 5>it's spotty around the country.</v>

5005
02:14:17.640 --> 02:14:18.840
<v Speaker 5>I'll have to go to the farm.</v>

5006
02:14:19.320 --> 02:14:20.153
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

5007
02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:22.320
<v Speaker 5>Senate bill s five 10 Sanibel.</v>

5008
02:14:22.321 --> 02:14:22.990
<v Speaker 5>That's five 10.</v>

5009
02:14:22.990 --> 02:14:24.060
<v Speaker 5>And what does it actually say?</v>

5010
02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:25.440
<v Speaker 5>What does the actual language,</v>

5011
02:14:25.740 --> 02:14:26.820
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty long.</v>

5012
02:14:27.690 --> 02:14:28.830
<v Speaker 5>It was not enacted.</v>

5013
02:14:28.920 --> 02:14:30.090
<v Speaker 5>It was not passed.</v>

5014
02:14:30.120 --> 02:14:34.890
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't know that there was a senator from Montana who introduced an amendment</v>

5015
02:14:34.891 --> 02:14:37.410
<v Speaker 5>to that bill that removed that clause from there.</v>

5016
02:14:37.800 --> 02:14:38.633
<v Speaker 5>Isn't that crazy?</v>

5017
02:14:39.670 --> 02:14:39.881
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5018
02:14:39.881 --> 02:14:41.840
<v Speaker 5>What kind of an asshole do you have to be seated?</v>

5019
02:14:41.850 --> 02:14:43.020
<v Speaker 5>I love to go out tomatoes.</v>

5020
02:14:43.340 --> 02:14:44.910
<v Speaker 5>I think we were just not enough.</v>

5021
02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:45.330
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5022
02:14:45.330 --> 02:14:47.280
<v Speaker 5>we've already fixed all the problems in the world.</v>

5023
02:14:47.281 --> 02:14:48.900
<v Speaker 5>It's concentrate on people growing food.</v>

5024
02:14:48.930 --> 02:14:49.380
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5025
02:14:49.380 --> 02:14:52.080
<v Speaker 5>Think about all the shit that we have problems with prison,</v>

5026
02:14:52.081 --> 02:14:53.190
<v Speaker 5>overpopulation,</v>

5027
02:14:53.191 --> 02:14:53.970
<v Speaker 5>war on drugs,</v>

5028
02:14:53.970 --> 02:14:55.770
<v Speaker 5>all the different issues that we have to deal with.</v>

5029
02:14:55.770 --> 02:14:56.820
<v Speaker 5>Pollution of the environment.</v>

5030
02:14:56.940 --> 02:14:59.430
<v Speaker 5>And someone shows the contrary on people grow fucking food.</v>

5031
02:14:59.460 --> 02:15:03.790
<v Speaker 5>But our whole civilization now is predicated with the corporate control to</v>

5032
02:15:03.810 --> 02:15:06.930
<v Speaker 5>banking control on us not being independent,</v>

5033
02:15:07.140 --> 02:15:11.730
<v Speaker 5>not being able to function outside of a system that they control that the giant</v>

5034
02:15:11.731 --> 02:15:13.050
<v Speaker 5>agribusiness corporations,</v>

5035
02:15:13.051 --> 02:15:14.880
<v Speaker 5>Monsanto and Cargill control.</v>

5036
02:15:14.980 --> 02:15:16.770
<v Speaker 5>How scary is Monsanto Santos?</v>

5037
02:15:16.771 --> 02:15:17.480
<v Speaker 5>Crazy.</v>

5038
02:15:17.480 --> 02:15:18.270
<v Speaker 5>Terrifying.</v>

5039
02:15:18.270 --> 02:15:21.810
<v Speaker 5>Did you know that Monsanto was one of the companies that was looking into buying</v>

5040
02:15:21.811 --> 02:15:24.300
<v Speaker 5>black water and black water was believe that?</v>

5041
02:15:24.450 --> 02:15:25.283
<v Speaker 5>Do you believe that?</v>

5042
02:15:25.310 --> 02:15:25.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5043
02:15:25.930 --> 02:15:29.160
<v Speaker 5>They can't tell like who bought a controlling stake and they couldn't tell if it</v>

5044
02:15:29.161 --> 02:15:31.650
<v Speaker 5>was like one of the people that owns Monsanto cause it's,</v>

5045
02:15:31.920 --> 02:15:32.191
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5046
02:15:32.191 --> 02:15:34.290
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of crazy paperwork you've got to go through.</v>

5047
02:15:34.291 --> 02:15:37.520
<v Speaker 5>But the idea that that was even thought of that the country that could Jorg</v>

5048
02:15:37.560 --> 02:15:38.730
<v Speaker 5>accompany rather the controls,</v>

5049
02:15:38.731 --> 02:15:42.360
<v Speaker 5>food growth in hundreds of countries and not hundreds,</v>

5050
02:15:42.361 --> 02:15:43.470
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of countries,</v>

5051
02:15:43.471 --> 02:15:44.580
<v Speaker 5>but not only does that,</v>

5052
02:15:44.581 --> 02:15:49.581
<v Speaker 5>but it's been shown that politically they forced their GMO foods on these</v>

5053
02:15:49.621 --> 02:15:51.270
<v Speaker 5>countries that don't want it,</v>

5054
02:15:51.271 --> 02:15:52.200
<v Speaker 5>can't afford it.</v>

5055
02:15:52.260 --> 02:15:55.260
<v Speaker 5>They have suicides all over the world where people can't keep up.</v>

5056
02:15:55.261 --> 02:15:56.640
<v Speaker 5>Farmers are committing suicide,</v>

5057
02:15:56.641 --> 02:15:59.190
<v Speaker 5>can't grow their own food again.</v>

5058
02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:00.870
<v Speaker 5>They can't reuse seeds.</v>

5059
02:16:00.871 --> 02:16:02.470
<v Speaker 5>They can't make their own seeds.</v>

5060
02:16:02.480 --> 02:16:02.710
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

5061
02:16:02.710 --> 02:16:05.310
<v Speaker 5>so what's difficult to get about the concept?</v>

5062
02:16:05.311 --> 02:16:07.650
<v Speaker 5>It's something like that is just pure fucking evil.</v>

5063
02:16:07.980 --> 02:16:08.850
<v Speaker 5>That's what it is.</v>

5064
02:16:08.851 --> 02:16:09.630
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

5065
02:16:09.630 --> 02:16:11.430
<v Speaker 5>The fact that that's not stopped.</v>

5066
02:16:11.630 --> 02:16:11.850
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5067
02:16:11.850 --> 02:16:12.511
<v Speaker 5>it's amazing.</v>

5068
02:16:12.511 --> 02:16:15.150
<v Speaker 5>They didn't want to talk about gay marriage and a time like this and that.</v>

5069
02:16:15.151 --> 02:16:16.620
<v Speaker 5>It's even discussed.</v>

5070
02:16:16.790 --> 02:16:18.580
<v Speaker 5>You know that any of this nonsense it gets,</v>

5071
02:16:18.810 --> 02:16:18.961
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

5072
02:16:18.961 --> 02:16:19.331
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>

5073
02:16:19.331 --> 02:16:20.190
<v Speaker 5>What about the debt?</v>

5074
02:16:20.220 --> 02:16:21.330
<v Speaker 5>We got to push the debt back.</v>

5075
02:16:21.331 --> 02:16:22.770
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck about this?</v>

5076
02:16:22.890 --> 02:16:23.790
<v Speaker 5>What about everything?</v>

5077
02:16:23.810 --> 02:16:23.931
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5078
02:16:23.931 --> 02:16:25.170
<v Speaker 5>what about the whole pile of it?</v>

5079
02:16:25.171 --> 02:16:26.640
<v Speaker 5>It's Goddamn ridiculous.</v>

5080
02:16:26.660 --> 02:16:29.860
<v Speaker 5>If design seeds to suicide itself after one season,</v>

5081
02:16:29.890 --> 02:16:30.010
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

5082
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:31.000
<v Speaker 6>was so scared.</v>

5083
02:16:31.001 --> 02:16:34.240
<v Speaker 6>But we've had some stories on collapsing that recently that shows that the</v>

5084
02:16:34.360 --> 02:16:37.700
<v Speaker 6>Monsanto supposedly bulletproof seeds are producing mutations,</v>

5085
02:16:37.740 --> 02:16:39.400
<v Speaker 6>which Monsanto can't control.</v>

5086
02:16:40.430 --> 02:16:43.540
<v Speaker 6>There was like one that was just released on us.</v>

5087
02:16:43.541 --> 02:16:43.990
<v Speaker 6>Some,</v>

5088
02:16:43.990 --> 02:16:48.070
<v Speaker 6>some major news source was talking about the connection between animals having</v>

5089
02:16:48.071 --> 02:16:49.270
<v Speaker 6>tumors and their meaning.</v>

5090
02:16:49.271 --> 02:16:51.580
<v Speaker 6>Some corn that Monsanto genetically modified corn.</v>

5091
02:16:51.670 --> 02:16:52.960
<v Speaker 6>It's not for human consumption,</v>

5092
02:16:53.290 --> 02:16:56.200
<v Speaker 6>but it doesn't matter because you're fucking feeding it to animals.</v>

5093
02:16:56.201 --> 02:16:58.420
<v Speaker 6>Those animals might get eaten by people and you know,</v>

5094
02:16:58.421 --> 02:16:59.830
<v Speaker 6>you don't know what the fuck goes through.</v>

5095
02:16:59.860 --> 02:17:00.190
<v Speaker 6>You don't,</v>

5096
02:17:00.190 --> 02:17:01.023
<v Speaker 6>they don't know.</v>

5097
02:17:01.090 --> 02:17:02.980
<v Speaker 6>They don't know what the reaction is.</v>

5098
02:17:02.990 --> 02:17:07.330
<v Speaker 6>A human body eating 20 years of genetically modified beef because we haven't</v>

5099
02:17:07.331 --> 02:17:07.950
<v Speaker 6>done it yet,</v>

5100
02:17:07.950 --> 02:17:10.470
<v Speaker 3>but now get that around the world.</v>

5101
02:17:10.500 --> 02:17:15.500
<v Speaker 3>There are tens and hundreds of millions of people moving to re localize to grow</v>

5102
02:17:15.781 --> 02:17:16.740
<v Speaker 3>organic food.</v>

5103
02:17:16.741 --> 02:17:17.574
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm doing.</v>

5104
02:17:17.940 --> 02:17:18.773
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

5105
02:17:18.890 --> 02:17:21.390
<v Speaker 3>and to take control where we can.</v>

5106
02:17:21.391 --> 02:17:22.830
<v Speaker 3>And those are the faster campers.</v>

5107
02:17:22.831 --> 02:17:24.660
<v Speaker 3>Those are the ones who aren't going to get eaten by the bear.</v>

5108
02:17:24.750 --> 02:17:29.750
<v Speaker 6>What is going to be the big difference between after the collapse and now what</v>

5109
02:17:31.141 --> 02:17:34.590
<v Speaker 6>is going to be more most inconvenient about after the collapse?</v>

5110
02:17:34.770 --> 02:17:36.480
<v Speaker 6>Are we going to have like crime issues?</v>

5111
02:17:36.481 --> 02:17:38.010
<v Speaker 6>We're going to have like roaming gangs.</v>

5112
02:17:38.011 --> 02:17:39.790
<v Speaker 6>That's going to be during the collapse during the,</v>

5113
02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:40.930
<v Speaker 3>that's all.</v>

5114
02:17:40.930 --> 02:17:42.100
<v Speaker 3>That's all what's coming.</v>

5115
02:17:42.130 --> 02:17:44.100
<v Speaker 3>That's what's here now and that's happening all over.</v>

5116
02:17:44.110 --> 02:17:46.630
<v Speaker 3>We had the bloody Reiland riots all over England.</v>

5117
02:17:46.631 --> 02:17:48.610
<v Speaker 3>We had our MacArthur set on fire in Rome,</v>

5118
02:17:49.060 --> 02:17:50.050
<v Speaker 3>the Arab spring,</v>

5119
02:17:50.051 --> 02:17:50.261
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

5120
02:17:50.261 --> 02:17:50.351
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

5121
02:17:50.351 --> 02:17:50.480
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

5122
02:17:50.480 --> 02:17:51.860
<v Speaker 6>But in general there's like,</v>

5123
02:17:51.890 --> 02:17:54.110
<v Speaker 6>you have a few things that the like blipping up,</v>

5124
02:17:54.111 --> 02:17:57.170
<v Speaker 6>but if you look at the overall harmony of the earth at any given moment,</v>

5125
02:17:57.350 --> 02:17:59.630
<v Speaker 6>most places are not in conflict,</v>

5126
02:17:59.690 --> 02:18:00.230
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

5127
02:18:00.230 --> 02:18:02.630
<v Speaker 6>Most places are just people going about their business,</v>

5128
02:18:02.631 --> 02:18:03.470
<v Speaker 6>trying to live their life.</v>

5129
02:18:03.590 --> 02:18:06.440
<v Speaker 6>What these spotted atrocities popping up here and there.</v>

5130
02:18:06.740 --> 02:18:06.980
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5131
02:18:06.980 --> 02:18:08.180
<v Speaker 6>if you look at it on a,</v>

5132
02:18:08.270 --> 02:18:08.601
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5133
02:18:08.601 --> 02:18:08.871
<v Speaker 6>as a,</v>

5134
02:18:08.871 --> 02:18:10.520
<v Speaker 6>as an organism in conflict,</v>

5135
02:18:10.521 --> 02:18:11.720
<v Speaker 6>it's not in as much.</v>

5136
02:18:11.920 --> 02:18:13.760
<v Speaker 6>It's not like a hundred percent conflict,</v>

5137
02:18:14.430 --> 02:18:15.263
<v Speaker 6>eh,</v>

5138
02:18:15.680 --> 02:18:18.230
<v Speaker 6>direct correlation between that and population density.</v>

5139
02:18:18.380 --> 02:18:19.760
<v Speaker 6>Big cities are not sustainable.</v>

5140
02:18:20.570 --> 02:18:22.760
<v Speaker 6>And when you see things like Egypt,</v>

5141
02:18:22.761 --> 02:18:23.151
<v Speaker 6>like the,</v>

5142
02:18:23.151 --> 02:18:23.350
<v Speaker 6>these,</v>

5143
02:18:23.350 --> 02:18:27.260
<v Speaker 6>these crazy beatings or they're doing the protesters in Egypt now and you see</v>

5144
02:18:27.261 --> 02:18:27.701
<v Speaker 6>like this,</v>

5145
02:18:27.701 --> 02:18:29.600
<v Speaker 6>this battle to control Iraq,</v>

5146
02:18:29.630 --> 02:18:33.520
<v Speaker 6>do you think that that was engineered that they knew that in a vacuum that you</v>

5147
02:18:33.521 --> 02:18:33.651
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>

5148
02:18:33.651 --> 02:18:36.680
<v Speaker 6>these puppet governments they put in place would quickly fall apart?</v>

5149
02:18:36.740 --> 02:18:37.260
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

5150
02:18:37.260 --> 02:18:37.630
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5151
02:18:37.630 --> 02:18:42.140
<v Speaker 3>I really think the US government was a cocky phlegm Boozell old cocky because we</v>

5152
02:18:42.141 --> 02:18:42.800
<v Speaker 3>built,</v>

5153
02:18:42.800 --> 02:18:47.360
<v Speaker 3>and I have this in Rubicon three mega basis there that were meant to be</v>

5154
02:18:47.361 --> 02:18:48.710
<v Speaker 3>permanent installations.</v>

5155
02:18:48.711 --> 02:18:49.820
<v Speaker 3>And I mean some of the largest,</v>

5156
02:18:49.821 --> 02:18:51.830
<v Speaker 3>most expensive military basis ever built.</v>

5157
02:18:52.340 --> 02:18:53.170
<v Speaker 3>We built a,</v>

5158
02:18:53.170 --> 02:18:53.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5159
02:18:53.450 --> 02:18:56.240
<v Speaker 3>an embassy compound larger than Vatican City.</v>

5160
02:18:56.750 --> 02:18:57.080
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5161
02:18:57.080 --> 02:18:59.180
<v Speaker 3>we're going to house like 8,000 people.</v>

5162
02:18:59.181 --> 02:19:00.860
<v Speaker 3>We plan to be there forever.</v>

5163
02:19:00.890 --> 02:19:03.020
<v Speaker 3>So is why we get now it's just too crazy.</v>

5164
02:19:03.140 --> 02:19:04.640
<v Speaker 3>This is the Roman Empire.</v>

5165
02:19:04.641 --> 02:19:05.390
<v Speaker 3>It's crumbling.</v>

5166
02:19:05.390 --> 02:19:06.380
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

5167
02:19:06.710 --> 02:19:07.850
<v Speaker 3>This is the Roman Empire.</v>

5168
02:19:07.851 --> 02:19:11.660
<v Speaker 3>It's fall and the whole world can see that the world starting to move much more</v>

5169
02:19:11.670 --> 02:19:16.550
<v Speaker 3>closely into alignment with China and China is imploding also.</v>

5170
02:19:16.551 --> 02:19:17.990
<v Speaker 3>That's the other catch to this.</v>

5171
02:19:18.570 --> 02:19:19.420
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

5172
02:19:19.700 --> 02:19:23.000
<v Speaker 3>and the same thing is happening with money as,</v>

5173
02:19:23.001 --> 02:19:23.780
<v Speaker 3>as it is with,</v>

5174
02:19:23.780 --> 02:19:27.290
<v Speaker 3>with life and everything else is that people are jumping to the next safest and</v>

5175
02:19:27.291 --> 02:19:28.130
<v Speaker 3>all they're doing is moving</v>

5176
02:19:28.130 --> 02:19:29.480
<v Speaker 4>up one deck on the titanic</v>

5177
02:19:31.290 --> 02:19:32.960
<v Speaker 4>to a deck that hasn't gone underwater yet</v>

5178
02:19:33.310 --> 02:19:36.070
<v Speaker 1>and hoping that their kids live to be,</v>

5179
02:19:36.370 --> 02:19:41.370
<v Speaker 1>to miss the next big wave that they get to stay alive and die before it all the</v>

5180
02:19:42.131 --> 02:19:43.240
<v Speaker 1>shit hits the fan again.</v>

5181
02:19:43.540 --> 02:19:43.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5182
02:19:43.880 --> 02:19:44.950
<v Speaker 1>can it be held back?</v>

5183
02:19:44.951 --> 02:19:45.731
<v Speaker 1>Is it a wave?</v>

5184
02:19:45.731 --> 02:19:46.890
<v Speaker 1>There's a come and go there.</v>

5185
02:19:46.891 --> 02:19:49.240
<v Speaker 1>I just have to completely flat line and then rebuild.</v>

5186
02:19:50.040 --> 02:19:51.900
<v Speaker 4>It won't be flat line across the board.</v>

5187
02:19:52.530 --> 02:19:53.970
<v Speaker 4>When the Roman empire collapsed,</v>

5188
02:19:53.971 --> 02:19:56.370
<v Speaker 4>there were some small towns that survived as pockets,</v>

5189
02:19:56.760 --> 02:19:57.091
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5190
02:19:57.091 --> 02:19:58.260
<v Speaker 4>of wisdom and you know,</v>

5191
02:19:58.261 --> 02:19:58.460
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

5192
02:19:58.460 --> 02:20:00.390
<v Speaker 4>some civilization was held for a while.</v>

5193
02:20:00.510 --> 02:20:02.070
<v Speaker 4>That's the way this is going to play.</v>

5194
02:20:02.071 --> 02:20:05.340
<v Speaker 4>There are going to be places around the world that,</v>

5195
02:20:05.370 --> 02:20:05.521
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5196
02:20:05.521 --> 02:20:06.770
<v Speaker 4>that by virtue of,</v>

5197
02:20:06.790 --> 02:20:11.730
<v Speaker 4>of climate there a orientation to permaculture sustainable economies and the</v>

5198
02:20:11.731 --> 02:20:14.790
<v Speaker 4>skill sets they have that will fare better than other regions.</v>

5199
02:20:15.360 --> 02:20:16.193
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5200
02:20:16.260 --> 02:20:19.830
<v Speaker 4>I think basically the people in the cities are fucked and if you stay in the big</v>

5201
02:20:19.831 --> 02:20:20.101
<v Speaker 4>city,</v>

5202
02:20:20.101 --> 02:20:20.934
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be fucked.</v>

5203
02:20:21.680 --> 02:20:22.070
<v Speaker 4>No one,</v>

5204
02:20:22.070 --> 02:20:22.903
<v Speaker 4>no food here.</v>

5205
02:20:22.950 --> 02:20:24.750
<v Speaker 4>It's only a three day food supply in Los Angeles.</v>

5206
02:20:24.751 --> 02:20:26.040
<v Speaker 4>I graduated from Venice High School.</v>

5207
02:20:26.041 --> 02:20:26.940
<v Speaker 4>I went to Ucla,</v>

5208
02:20:26.941 --> 02:20:27.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5209
02:20:27.650 --> 02:20:28.770
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

5210
02:20:28.800 --> 02:20:31.590
<v Speaker 4>there's only a three day food supply in the city and there's not enough fresh</v>

5211
02:20:31.591 --> 02:20:32.041
<v Speaker 4>water here.</v>

5212
02:20:32.041 --> 02:20:33.750
<v Speaker 4>We steal the water from northern California.</v>

5213
02:20:34.170 --> 02:20:37.080
<v Speaker 4>Las Vegas shouldn't even exist and Phoenix is going to go under,</v>

5214
02:20:37.100 --> 02:20:38.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean those cities,</v>

5215
02:20:38.251 --> 02:20:38.430
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

5216
02:20:38.430 --> 02:20:40.020
<v Speaker 1>Love the story of the salt and sea.</v>

5217
02:20:40.290 --> 02:20:41.250
<v Speaker 1>This is one of my favorites.</v>

5218
02:20:41.251 --> 02:20:41.701
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5219
02:20:41.701 --> 02:20:43.650
<v Speaker 1>I've watched several documentaries,</v>

5220
02:20:43.651 --> 02:20:47.100
<v Speaker 1>read a bunch of things on and I've got a whole coffee table book at home of</v>

5221
02:20:47.101 --> 02:20:48.330
<v Speaker 1>photos from the salt and sea.</v>

5222
02:20:48.540 --> 02:20:50.190
<v Speaker 1>That's an amazing story in and of itself.</v>

5223
02:20:50.240 --> 02:20:55.170
<v Speaker 1>And we just decided to get crazy and create a civilization out there in the</v>

5224
02:20:55.171 --> 02:20:57.450
<v Speaker 1>middle of the desert where they happened to Vegas easily.</v>

5225
02:20:57.480 --> 02:20:57.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5226
02:20:57.690 --> 02:20:58.523
<v Speaker 1>Thanks sir.</v>

5227
02:20:58.640 --> 02:20:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

5228
02:20:58.920 --> 02:21:01.530
<v Speaker 1>They're going to keep Vegas alive as long as they can because this weekend it's</v>

5229
02:21:01.531 --> 02:21:04.050
<v Speaker 1>Brock Lesnar vs Alistair Overeem bitch.</v>

5230
02:21:04.200 --> 02:21:05.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5231
02:21:05.600 --> 02:21:08.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean you could live on stripper milk for a couple of days extra,</v>

5232
02:21:08.461 --> 02:21:09.294
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

5233
02:21:11.550 --> 02:21:15.240
<v Speaker 1>And you could kill small animals with their heels and if you know,</v>

5234
02:21:15.241 --> 02:21:17.160
<v Speaker 1>use their heels off projectiles.</v>

5235
02:21:17.360 --> 02:21:17.791
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

5236
02:21:17.791 --> 02:21:18.900
<v Speaker 1>there's all the squirrels.</v>

5237
02:21:19.350 --> 02:21:23.370
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be some bizarre Darwinian evolution and adaptations is this</v>

5238
02:21:23.371 --> 02:21:24.204
<v Speaker 1>thing falls apart.</v>

5239
02:21:24.550 --> 02:21:26.220
<v Speaker 1>You're going to make it through how much,</v>

5240
02:21:26.280 --> 02:21:29.130
<v Speaker 1>how much longer do you think it's going to be before everything it was easy is a</v>

5241
02:21:29.131 --> 02:21:31.710
<v Speaker 1>50 year processes at a hundred year probably we going to see this,</v>

5242
02:21:31.711 --> 02:21:34.710
<v Speaker 1>am I going to be alive to see this new of same has happened</v>

5243
02:21:34.780 --> 02:21:35.021
<v Speaker 4>much,</v>

5244
02:21:35.021 --> 02:21:36.610
<v Speaker 4>much faster than I thought it would.</v>

5245
02:21:37.480 --> 02:21:40.910
<v Speaker 4>Especially with the deterioration in the quality of US government and,</v>

5246
02:21:40.911 --> 02:21:45.911
<v Speaker 4>and the legality or honorable nature of the u s government and,</v>

5247
02:21:46.011 --> 02:21:47.350
<v Speaker 4>and the economic situation.</v>

5248
02:21:48.160 --> 02:21:48.993
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5249
02:21:49.110 --> 02:21:52.920
<v Speaker 1>does it disturb you when you see Obama and looking confident and talking about</v>

5250
02:21:52.921 --> 02:21:57.080
<v Speaker 1>his legacy as a president and disturb you to see like this unaware mother</v>

5251
02:21:57.081 --> 02:21:57.421
<v Speaker 1>fucker?</v>

5252
02:21:57.421 --> 02:21:58.350
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you doing?</v>

5253
02:21:58.351 --> 02:22:00.290
<v Speaker 1>Why are you sitting there calm and,</v>

5254
02:22:00.291 --> 02:22:01.620
<v Speaker 1>and congratulatory,</v>

5255
02:22:01.820 --> 02:22:04.830
<v Speaker 1>you know about your administration and the accomplishments that you've achieved?</v>

5256
02:22:04.980 --> 02:22:07.980
<v Speaker 1>Do you not see that the fucking sky is falling?</v>

5257
02:22:08.100 --> 02:22:08.910
<v Speaker 1>Do you not see it?</v>

5258
02:22:08.910 --> 02:22:09.840
<v Speaker 1>Look at you sitting there.</v>

5259
02:22:10.060 --> 02:22:11.880
<v Speaker 1>You sit in there like a demure gentlemen.</v>

5260
02:22:11.940 --> 02:22:16.710
<v Speaker 1>I've been so calm and so accustomed to being in front of the camera</v>

5261
02:22:16.830 --> 02:22:17.490
<v Speaker 4>was president.</v>

5262
02:22:17.490 --> 02:22:17.881
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5263
02:22:17.881 --> 02:22:21.240
<v Speaker 4>it's like everybody in Washington does the same thing.</v>

5264
02:22:22.260 --> 02:22:22.891
<v Speaker 4>It's ridiculous.</v>

5265
02:22:22.891 --> 02:22:24.060
<v Speaker 4>You know those people.</v>

5266
02:22:24.210 --> 02:22:24.811
<v Speaker 4>That's why we're,</v>

5267
02:22:24.811 --> 02:22:25.290
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

5268
02:22:25.290 --> 02:22:25.531
<v Speaker 4>Ron.</v>

5269
02:22:25.531 --> 02:22:26.580
<v Speaker 4>Paul is so important.</v>

5270
02:22:26.890 --> 02:22:27.481
<v Speaker 4>Solar power,</v>

5271
02:22:27.481 --> 02:22:28.200
<v Speaker 4>yes or no,</v>

5272
02:22:28.200 --> 02:22:29.070
<v Speaker 4>should we get solar power?</v>

5273
02:22:29.130 --> 02:22:31.080
<v Speaker 4>So if you can get it,</v>

5274
02:22:31.130 --> 02:22:36.130
<v Speaker 4>it won't solve all the world's problems and we need to stop buying that trap</v>

5275
02:22:37.500 --> 02:22:40.200
<v Speaker 4>that we have to solve the problem for the whole world before we take care of</v>

5276
02:22:40.201 --> 02:22:41.034
<v Speaker 4>ourselves.</v>

5277
02:22:41.260 --> 02:22:42.380
<v Speaker 1>We need to take care of ourselves.</v>

5278
02:22:42.480 --> 02:22:43.240
<v Speaker 1>Take our ourselves.</v>

5279
02:22:43.240 --> 02:22:45.040
<v Speaker 1>Put Your own oxygen mask on first.</v>

5280
02:22:45.190 --> 02:22:45.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5281
02:22:45.431 --> 02:22:47.890
<v Speaker 1>It's not like we were rushing out to fix Liberia.</v>

5282
02:22:47.950 --> 02:22:48.340
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5283
02:22:48.340 --> 02:22:48.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5284
02:22:48.820 --> 02:22:50.260
<v Speaker 1>we know how bad it is over there.</v>

5285
02:22:50.261 --> 02:22:51.910
<v Speaker 1>I know now about it is in Somalia.</v>

5286
02:22:52.050 --> 02:22:52.390
<v Speaker 1>We're not,</v>

5287
02:22:52.390 --> 02:22:53.800
<v Speaker 1>we're not running over there to fix that.</v>

5288
02:22:53.840 --> 02:22:54.673
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

5289
02:22:54.880 --> 02:22:56.410
<v Speaker 4>We take care of ourselves here first.</v>

5290
02:22:56.411 --> 02:22:56.540
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

5291
02:22:56.540 --> 02:22:59.140
<v Speaker 4>and those of us who work to build community,</v>

5292
02:22:59.141 --> 02:23:00.690
<v Speaker 4>there's a great movement transition us.</v>

5293
02:23:00.700 --> 02:23:04.390
<v Speaker 4>There's transition into Su and initiatives about 111,</v>

5294
02:23:04.391 --> 02:23:08.350
<v Speaker 4>I think all over the country now in cities all over the country where where</v>

5295
02:23:08.351 --> 02:23:10.510
<v Speaker 4>people are forming communities,</v>

5296
02:23:10.511 --> 02:23:11.800
<v Speaker 4>they're growing food locally,</v>

5297
02:23:11.801 --> 02:23:13.000
<v Speaker 4>they're networking with each other,</v>

5298
02:23:13.001 --> 02:23:15.220
<v Speaker 4>they're working outside of the economic system.</v>

5299
02:23:15.640 --> 02:23:18.790
<v Speaker 4>They're learning skills that they're going to need and we're all going to need</v>

5300
02:23:18.791 --> 02:23:21.430
<v Speaker 4>at some point learn how to live with less power and things like that.</v>

5301
02:23:21.820 --> 02:23:22.890
<v Speaker 4>And this movement is at,</v>

5302
02:23:22.920 --> 02:23:23.790
<v Speaker 4>we have a uh,</v>

5303
02:23:23.880 --> 02:23:26.740
<v Speaker 4>a directory on collapsed at the light director,</v>

5304
02:23:26.770 --> 02:23:27.603
<v Speaker 4>absolutely free.</v>

5305
02:23:27.610 --> 02:23:32.610
<v Speaker 4>1600 hand picked entries and you go in and you look around this directory and</v>

5306
02:23:32.711 --> 02:23:37.600
<v Speaker 4>you realize that all over the world there's all kinds of people working really</v>

5307
02:23:37.601 --> 02:23:40.780
<v Speaker 4>hard and have been for quite some time to prepare to transit,</v>

5308
02:23:40.781 --> 02:23:44.900
<v Speaker 4>to live outside of the infinite growth paradigm after peak oil and,</v>

5309
02:23:44.901 --> 02:23:45.470
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

5310
02:23:45.470 --> 02:23:46.370
<v Speaker 1>and it can be done,</v>

5311
02:23:46.371 --> 02:23:48.050
<v Speaker 1>but you have to do it in small groups.</v>

5312
02:23:48.260 --> 02:23:52.460
<v Speaker 1>But then you have to be worried about being raided by a mad hordes of fucking</v>

5313
02:23:52.461 --> 02:23:54.350
<v Speaker 1>scoundrels and zombies.</v>

5314
02:23:54.380 --> 02:23:56.030
<v Speaker 1>Depends on the apocalypse.</v>

5315
02:23:56.140 --> 02:23:57.490
<v Speaker 4>Zombie Apocalypse Thrill,</v>

5316
02:23:57.500 --> 02:23:58.270
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5317
02:23:58.270 --> 02:23:59.290
<v Speaker 4>Most of the zombies,</v>

5318
02:23:59.291 --> 02:24:02.320
<v Speaker 4>I don't think we'll ever get out of the big cities because so many people are so</v>

5319
02:24:02.321 --> 02:24:03.080
<v Speaker 4>out of touch.</v>

5320
02:24:03.080 --> 02:24:05.540
<v Speaker 1>So the big cities or just be like die offs,</v>

5321
02:24:05.600 --> 02:24:06.560
<v Speaker 1>giant die offs.</v>

5322
02:24:06.590 --> 02:24:08.090
<v Speaker 1>Just like there were for the Mayans.</v>

5323
02:24:08.330 --> 02:24:08.541
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5324
02:24:08.541 --> 02:24:12.800
<v Speaker 1>The Mayans left the giant temple's behind and when they discovered him hundreds</v>

5325
02:24:12.800 --> 02:24:12.801
<v Speaker 1>of years later,</v>

5326
02:24:12.801 --> 02:24:13.670
<v Speaker 1>they are covered in trees</v>

5327
02:24:13.900 --> 02:24:15.160
<v Speaker 4>and there are people who are,</v>

5328
02:24:15.240 --> 02:24:18.850
<v Speaker 4>have been putting a lot of time into thinking about how to defend what they have</v>

5329
02:24:18.851 --> 02:24:20.200
<v Speaker 4>if people come and try to take it.</v>

5330
02:24:20.500 --> 02:24:22.090
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think about the,</v>

5331
02:24:22.480 --> 02:24:26.920
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was the ATF saying that they were going to stop people with medical</v>

5332
02:24:26.921 --> 02:24:29.560
<v Speaker 1>marijuana prescriptions from buying new guns.</v>

5333
02:24:30.100 --> 02:24:33.160
<v Speaker 1>They weren't going to allow you if you get a prescription for medical marijuana</v>

5334
02:24:33.161 --> 02:24:33.821
<v Speaker 1>to own a gun,</v>

5335
02:24:33.821 --> 02:24:35.840
<v Speaker 1>which is whole areas.</v>

5336
02:24:35.940 --> 02:24:36.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5337
02:24:36.050 --> 02:24:38.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean I live in Sonoma county where,</v>

5338
02:24:38.090 --> 02:24:38.870
<v Speaker 4>which is a,</v>

5339
02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:39.180
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5340
02:24:39.180 --> 02:24:41.260
<v Speaker 4>illegal grow county and I handle that.</v>

5341
02:24:41.290 --> 02:24:41.991
<v Speaker 4>Have to get a,</v>

5342
02:24:41.991 --> 02:24:42.460
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5343
02:24:42.460 --> 02:24:44.600
<v Speaker 4>I have a letter because I had really bad,</v>

5344
02:24:44.601 --> 02:24:45.434
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

5345
02:24:45.560 --> 02:24:47.180
<v Speaker 4>my thumb socket was shattered.</v>

5346
02:24:47.210 --> 02:24:50.030
<v Speaker 4>I mean that the socket was an eight pieces and that's where all the nerves in</v>

5347
02:24:50.031 --> 02:24:50.960
<v Speaker 4>the hand come together.</v>

5348
02:24:51.020 --> 02:24:51.620
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>

5349
02:24:51.620 --> 02:24:52.700
<v Speaker 4>And that happened.</v>

5350
02:24:52.701 --> 02:24:54.980
<v Speaker 4>And a horse horseback riding accident.</v>

5351
02:24:55.640 --> 02:24:56.330
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

5352
02:24:56.330 --> 02:24:57.121
<v Speaker 4>and I'm a horse one.</v>

5353
02:24:57.121 --> 02:24:58.010
<v Speaker 4>I've been a horseman a long time,</v>

5354
02:24:58.430 --> 02:24:59.100
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

5355
02:24:59.100 --> 02:24:59.580
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

5356
02:24:59.580 --> 02:24:59.881
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

5357
02:24:59.881 --> 02:25:00.860
<v Speaker 4>and that works for me,</v>

5358
02:25:00.890 --> 02:25:05.890
<v Speaker 4>but I don't grow because I owned guns and see that's a federal issue as opposed</v>

5359
02:25:07.791 --> 02:25:08.810
<v Speaker 4>to the state issue.</v>

5360
02:25:09.680 --> 02:25:10.513
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5361
02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:11.473
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

5362
02:25:11.570 --> 02:25:12.470
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff.</v>

5363
02:25:12.760 --> 02:25:13.780
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a matter of growing.</v>

5364
02:25:13.781 --> 02:25:15.790
<v Speaker 1>I think you're not even allowed to have a license for it.</v>

5365
02:25:15.820 --> 02:25:16.210
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5366
02:25:16.210 --> 02:25:16.780
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

5367
02:25:16.780 --> 02:25:17.380
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

5368
02:25:17.380 --> 02:25:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5369
02:25:18.040 --> 02:25:18.873
<v Speaker 1>They don't care.</v>

5370
02:25:18.940 --> 02:25:19.631
<v Speaker 1>So you can have a license.</v>

5371
02:25:19.631 --> 02:25:20.464
<v Speaker 1>You just can't grow.</v>

5372
02:25:20.860 --> 02:25:21.500
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

5373
02:25:21.500 --> 02:25:22.010
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5374
02:25:22.010 --> 02:25:22.843
<v Speaker 4>or you know,</v>

5375
02:25:22.850 --> 02:25:25.330
<v Speaker 4>or feds wouldn't know that if I was growing and owned guns,</v>

5376
02:25:25.331 --> 02:25:26.410
<v Speaker 4>which I obviously do,</v>

5377
02:25:26.880 --> 02:25:27.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5378
02:25:27.320 --> 02:25:30.090
<v Speaker 4>then they would come on some federal pretext,</v>

5379
02:25:30.100 --> 02:25:30.460
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

5380
02:25:30.460 --> 02:25:30.910
<v Speaker 4>But</v>

5381
02:25:30.910 --> 02:25:33.490
<v Speaker 6>how crazy is that that you could have a prescription for Oxycontin,</v>

5382
02:25:33.520 --> 02:25:34.600
<v Speaker 6>which he can't grow a plant.</v>

5383
02:25:35.530 --> 02:25:36.341
<v Speaker 6>That's amazing.</v>

5384
02:25:36.341 --> 02:25:36.701
<v Speaker 6>You could,</v>

5385
02:25:36.701 --> 02:25:38.590
<v Speaker 6>you could have a gun and have a prescription for oxies.</v>

5386
02:25:38.620 --> 02:25:42.760
<v Speaker 6>How absurd is it to make a plant that God created illegal to begin with?</v>

5387
02:25:42.790 --> 02:25:43.450
<v Speaker 6>It's amazing.</v>

5388
02:25:43.450 --> 02:25:44.860
<v Speaker 6>Not only that one's killed nobody.</v>

5389
02:25:45.150 --> 02:25:45.491
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5390
02:25:45.491 --> 02:25:46.390
<v Speaker 6>You know nobody,</v>

5391
02:25:46.450 --> 02:25:49.060
<v Speaker 6>I mean maybe some people who have had a few wacky ideas while they were high and</v>

5392
02:25:49.061 --> 02:25:50.110
<v Speaker 6>it caused a few deaths.</v>

5393
02:25:50.450 --> 02:25:50.950
<v Speaker 6>But listen,</v>

5394
02:25:50.950 --> 02:25:52.440
<v Speaker 6>that's just people with wacky ideas.</v>

5395
02:25:52.460 --> 02:25:53.710
<v Speaker 6>You can't blame pot for that.</v>

5396
02:25:53.740 --> 02:25:56.080
<v Speaker 6>So it's like Bill Hicks joke about a guy,</v>

5397
02:25:56.081 --> 02:25:57.610
<v Speaker 6>young man and acid thought he could fly,</v>

5398
02:25:57.611 --> 02:25:58.570
<v Speaker 6>jumped off a building.</v>

5399
02:25:58.571 --> 02:25:59.260
<v Speaker 6>What a tragedy.</v>

5400
02:25:59.260 --> 02:25:59.830
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

5401
02:25:59.830 --> 02:26:00.521
<v Speaker 6>what an idiot.</v>

5402
02:26:00.521 --> 02:26:01.331
<v Speaker 6>If he thought he could fly,</v>

5403
02:26:01.331 --> 02:26:03.250
<v Speaker 6>what did he test it off on the ground first?</v>

5404
02:26:03.710 --> 02:26:04.240
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5405
02:26:04.240 --> 02:26:06.110
<v Speaker 6>no one told him to jump off the fucking Bruno.</v>

5406
02:26:06.490 --> 02:26:07.100
<v Speaker 6>I was</v>

5407
02:26:07.100 --> 02:26:08.000
<v Speaker 4>work and and and and,</v>

5408
02:26:08.001 --> 02:26:09.370
<v Speaker 4>and I've seen bad drugs,</v>

5409
02:26:09.371 --> 02:26:11.300
<v Speaker 4>but the worst drug or that has ever been out there is,</v>

5410
02:26:11.320 --> 02:26:12.460
<v Speaker 4>is a angel dust.</v>

5411
02:26:13.030 --> 02:26:15.910
<v Speaker 4>I had to fight people on Angel Dust and it was the most ridiculous.</v>

5412
02:26:15.911 --> 02:26:16.720
<v Speaker 4>It was stupid.</v>

5413
02:26:16.720 --> 02:26:19.120
<v Speaker 4>Buddy of mine got his finger bit and often it was on angel dust.</v>

5414
02:26:19.240 --> 02:26:20.980
<v Speaker 4>He didn't even realize it until the next morning.</v>

5415
02:26:21.330 --> 02:26:23.170
<v Speaker 4>They have special purpose fucking finger.</v>

5416
02:26:23.580 --> 02:26:24.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5417
02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:26.620
<v Speaker 4>I'm the only guy in the history of LAPD to have been bitten in the left</v>

5418
02:26:26.621 --> 02:26:27.280
<v Speaker 4>testicle.</v>

5419
02:26:27.280 --> 02:26:28.450
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

5420
02:26:28.451 --> 02:26:29.740
<v Speaker 6>snap son.</v>

5421
02:26:30.100 --> 02:26:30.921
<v Speaker 6>Was it from the sham?</v>

5422
02:26:30.921 --> 02:26:31.481
<v Speaker 6>Wow Guy.</v>

5423
02:26:31.481 --> 02:26:32.470
<v Speaker 6>Did it burst it?</v>

5424
02:26:32.650 --> 02:26:33.483
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

5425
02:26:34.640 --> 02:26:36.100
<v Speaker 6>Imagine if it was so,</v>

5426
02:26:36.101 --> 02:26:37.270
<v Speaker 6>it just really hurt real bad.</v>

5427
02:26:37.300 --> 02:26:37.661
<v Speaker 6>It was,</v>

5428
02:26:37.661 --> 02:26:37.871
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

5429
02:26:37.871 --> 02:26:38.291

02:30:16.171 --> 02:30:18.210
<v Speaker 4>taught at West Point stands a great friend.</v>

5575
02:30:18.211 --> 02:30:19.110
<v Speaker 4>He's a brilliant writer,</v>

5576
02:30:19.140 --> 02:30:21.240
<v Speaker 4>but one of the best writers I wonderful human being.</v>

5577
02:30:21.241 --> 02:30:22.074
<v Speaker 4>I love the guy.</v>

5578
02:30:22.680 --> 02:30:25.380
<v Speaker 4>And she was trying to get in touch with Stan through from the wilderness.</v>

5579
02:30:25.381 --> 02:30:26.910
<v Speaker 4>And we had done a lot of expos ace.</v>

5580
02:30:26.911 --> 02:30:31.911
<v Speaker 4>And I went down to San Jose and I'm met with Danny and she gave me like 2000</v>

5581
02:30:33.391 --> 02:30:35.910
<v Speaker 4>plus pages of army records redacted,</v>

5582
02:30:35.911 --> 02:30:36.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5583
02:30:36.100 --> 02:30:36.990
<v Speaker 4>how black spots.</v>

5584
02:30:37.770 --> 02:30:40.110
<v Speaker 4>And so I spent the night copying those,</v>

5585
02:30:40.140 --> 02:30:40.800
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5586
02:30:40.800 --> 02:30:42.630
<v Speaker 4>every one of them in perfect order</v>

5587
02:30:44.490 --> 02:30:45.750
<v Speaker 5>and I thousand,</v>

5588
02:30:45.760 --> 02:30:46.630
<v Speaker 5>how long did that take?</v>

5589
02:30:48.160 --> 02:30:49.270
<v Speaker 4>You do what you gotta do.</v>

5590
02:30:50.050 --> 02:30:50.681
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

5591
02:30:50.681 --> 02:30:51.514
<v Speaker 4>so I copied him,</v>

5592
02:30:51.640 --> 02:30:53.140
<v Speaker 4>took them back to our offices in Ashland,</v>

5593
02:30:53.141 --> 02:30:53.531
<v Speaker 4>Oregon.</v>

5594
02:30:53.531 --> 02:30:55.960
<v Speaker 4>And I flew Stan golf out and a standard,</v>

5595
02:30:55.961 --> 02:30:56.471
<v Speaker 4>most of the work,</v>

5596
02:30:56.471 --> 02:30:58.360
<v Speaker 4>but we totally broke down the army story.</v>

5597
02:30:58.510 --> 02:31:00.880
<v Speaker 4>And we published a seven part series,</v>

5598
02:31:01.390 --> 02:31:04.240
<v Speaker 4>which was the basis of Henry Waxman's hearings in the House,</v>

5599
02:31:04.241 --> 02:31:06.010
<v Speaker 4>governmental affairs committee over,</v>

5600
02:31:06.170 --> 02:31:06.580
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5601
02:31:06.580 --> 02:31:06.851
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

5602
02:31:06.851 --> 02:31:07.121
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

5603
02:31:07.121 --> 02:31:09.110
<v Speaker 4>the cover up and we brought,</v>

5604
02:31:09.210 --> 02:31:10.870
<v Speaker 4>we got to six senior officers,</v>

5605
02:31:10.871 --> 02:31:14.860
<v Speaker 4>three general officer's a disciplined and we forced on Roosevelt to resign.</v>

5606
02:31:15.550 --> 02:31:16.091
<v Speaker 4>Well we were,</v>

5607
02:31:16.091 --> 02:31:16.481
<v Speaker 4>we were,</v>

5608
02:31:16.481 --> 02:31:17.920
<v Speaker 4>that's why Donald Ross summer resigned.</v>

5609
02:31:18.170 --> 02:31:19.003
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

5610
02:31:19.350 --> 02:31:23.130
<v Speaker 4>he resigned right when he was about to be called before the Tillman hearings.</v>

5611
02:31:23.520 --> 02:31:24.353
<v Speaker 4>Very suddenly.</v>

5612
02:31:24.570 --> 02:31:27.540
<v Speaker 4>So then he can't be called because he resigned.</v>

5613
02:31:27.570 --> 02:31:28.620
<v Speaker 4>And is that how you avoided it?</v>

5614
02:31:28.650 --> 02:31:29.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

5615
02:31:29.230 --> 02:31:31.350
<v Speaker 4>Is it an amazing when they have weird rules like that,</v>

5616
02:31:31.351 --> 02:31:32.041
<v Speaker 4>like Congress,</v>

5617
02:31:32.041 --> 02:31:33.720
<v Speaker 4>like they can insider trade.</v>

5618
02:31:34.050 --> 02:31:37.950
<v Speaker 4>It's not illegal for Congress to be inside of trading is his resignation was the</v>

5619
02:31:37.951 --> 02:31:38.940
<v Speaker 4>quid pro quo.</v>

5620
02:31:39.420 --> 02:31:39.780
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5621
02:31:39.780 --> 02:31:41.850
<v Speaker 4>he fell on his sword because it went to Bush.</v>

5622
02:31:42.080 --> 02:31:43.740
<v Speaker 4>He had went to Chaney and Bush,</v>

5623
02:31:44.490 --> 02:31:44.970
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

5624
02:31:44.970 --> 02:31:45.360
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

5625
02:31:45.360 --> 02:31:47.190
<v Speaker 4>a lot of crimes were covered with that.</v>

5626
02:31:47.191 --> 02:31:48.820
<v Speaker 4>That was just a horrendous miscarriage.</v>

5627
02:31:48.821 --> 02:31:51.390
<v Speaker 4>And you believe that it was an accident or do you believe that they killed him</v>

5628
02:31:51.391 --> 02:31:54.060
<v Speaker 4>on purpose because he was being very outspoken about his?</v>

5629
02:31:54.061 --> 02:31:54.560
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

5630
02:31:54.560 --> 02:31:56.370
<v Speaker 4>I what I believe is,</v>

5631
02:31:56.371 --> 02:31:58.530
<v Speaker 4>and I think enough time has passed where I can say this.</v>

5632
02:31:59.030 --> 02:31:59.240
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

5633
02:31:59.240 --> 02:32:00.150
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>

5634
02:32:00.151 --> 02:32:03.060
<v Speaker 4>I know a great many people in the service and I know special forces.</v>

5635
02:32:03.061 --> 02:32:05.280
<v Speaker 4>I know rangers and I know a lot of guys.</v>

5636
02:32:05.640 --> 02:32:07.200
<v Speaker 4>Pat Tillman had a very large ego.</v>

5637
02:32:08.040 --> 02:32:09.300
<v Speaker 4>He was very outspoken.</v>

5638
02:32:09.350 --> 02:32:10.590
<v Speaker 4>He had all the right ideas.</v>

5639
02:32:10.591 --> 02:32:11.850
<v Speaker 4>He knew the war was bullshit.</v>

5640
02:32:11.851 --> 02:32:13.290
<v Speaker 4>He was talking out about it,</v>

5641
02:32:13.740 --> 02:32:15.660
<v Speaker 4>but he was saying they fracked them.</v>

5642
02:32:16.380 --> 02:32:20.940
<v Speaker 4>I think that Pat Tillman became a ranger before he became a soldier.</v>

5643
02:32:22.230 --> 02:32:23.520
<v Speaker 4>If that means anything to you,</v>

5644
02:32:23.521 --> 02:32:25.740
<v Speaker 4>it's like putting on a black belt before you earn the green,</v>

5645
02:32:26.400 --> 02:32:26.950
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

5646
02:32:26.950 --> 02:32:27.690
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

5647
02:32:27.690 --> 02:32:28.523
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5648
02:32:28.620 --> 02:32:33.000
<v Speaker 4>and it was definitely a really fubar situation.</v>

5649
02:32:33.001 --> 02:32:35.460
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it was a planned premeditated murder.</v>

5650
02:32:36.560 --> 02:32:37.393
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

5651
02:32:37.500 --> 02:32:39.390
<v Speaker 4>but I do kind of suspect that,</v>

5652
02:32:39.391 --> 02:32:39.690
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5653
02:32:39.690 --> 02:32:39.991
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>

5654
02:32:39.991 --> 02:32:40.980
<v Speaker 4>his last words were,</v>

5655
02:32:41.280 --> 02:32:45.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm Pat fucking Tillman and that's one of three round burst hit him in the head,</v>

5656
02:32:46.950 --> 02:32:47.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5657
02:32:47.550 --> 02:32:49.290
<v Speaker 4>and so very sad,</v>

5658
02:32:49.470 --> 02:32:50.220
<v Speaker 4>very tragic.</v>

5659
02:32:50.220 --> 02:32:52.440
<v Speaker 4>And the people shooting had this communication.</v>

5660
02:32:53.280 --> 02:32:57.720
<v Speaker 4>The guy that shot him was a sergeant in his own cereal,</v>

5661
02:32:57.730 --> 02:32:58.770
<v Speaker 4>a shooting,</v>

5662
02:32:58.771 --> 02:33:01.380
<v Speaker 4>a three round burst out of assault squad,</v>

5663
02:33:01.381 --> 02:33:02.214
<v Speaker 4>automatic weapon,</v>

5664
02:33:02.910 --> 02:33:03.743
<v Speaker 4>30 yards.</v>

5665
02:33:03.960 --> 02:33:05.340
<v Speaker 4>Of course he knew what was going on.</v>

5666
02:33:05.370 --> 02:33:06.450
<v Speaker 4>So you think he killed them?</v>

5667
02:33:06.620 --> 02:33:07.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5668
02:33:07.260 --> 02:33:08.093
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

5669
02:33:08.100 --> 02:33:09.150
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

5670
02:33:09.390 --> 02:33:10.081
<v Speaker 4>And you think he killed him?</v>

5671
02:33:10.081 --> 02:33:11.490
<v Speaker 4>Just because he was too outspoken,</v>

5672
02:33:11.550 --> 02:33:11.730
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

5673
02:33:11.730 --> 02:33:13.500
<v Speaker 4>Cocky didn't want it and they didn't like him.</v>

5674
02:33:13.501 --> 02:33:14.090
<v Speaker 4>Fuck you.</v>

5675
02:33:14.090 --> 02:33:15.720
<v Speaker 4>That's too much speculation.</v>

5676
02:33:15.721 --> 02:33:16.141
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>

5677
02:33:16.141 --> 02:33:16.470
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5678
02:33:16.470 --> 02:33:17.071
<v Speaker 4>But they using,</v>

5679
02:33:17.071 --> 02:33:17.580
<v Speaker 4>they killed them.</v>

5680
02:33:17.580 --> 02:33:18.413
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5681
02:33:18.570 --> 02:33:20.840
<v Speaker 4>but not premeditated murder in,</v>

5682
02:33:20.841 --> 02:33:20.971
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

5683
02:33:20.971 --> 02:33:21.141
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

5684
02:33:21.141 --> 02:33:21.371
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

5685
02:33:21.371 --> 02:33:22.141
<v Speaker 4>in that sense.</v>

5686
02:33:22.141 --> 02:33:25.500
<v Speaker 4>But what we do know is that what the army did after that,</v>

5687
02:33:25.501 --> 02:33:27.030
<v Speaker 4>they destroyed evidence.</v>

5688
02:33:27.031 --> 02:33:28.170
<v Speaker 4>They burned his clothing.</v>

5689
02:33:28.171 --> 02:33:32.400
<v Speaker 4>They immediately started the write up for a silver star and all of that</v>

5690
02:33:32.401 --> 02:33:33.960
<v Speaker 4>criminality that followed,</v>

5691
02:33:33.961 --> 02:33:37.140
<v Speaker 4>rather than admit that he was killed in a friendly fire accident by his own</v>

5692
02:33:37.141 --> 02:33:37.560
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

5693
02:33:37.560 --> 02:33:41.310
<v Speaker 4>So were you the catalyst that forced them to admit that it was friendly fire?</v>

5694
02:33:41.760 --> 02:33:42.593
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5695
02:33:43.020 --> 02:33:43.730
<v Speaker 4>stand.</v>

5696
02:33:43.730 --> 02:33:45.680
<v Speaker 4>Let's give the credit where it's due to stand Goff.</v>

5697
02:33:45.720 --> 02:33:47.220
<v Speaker 4>I was the publisher and the editor.</v>

5698
02:33:47.221 --> 02:33:47.701
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>

5699
02:33:47.701 --> 02:33:52.380
<v Speaker 4>I put my money in my balls on the line and gave Stan golf everything he needed</v>

5700
02:33:52.381 --> 02:33:53.880
<v Speaker 4>to write a seven part series,</v>

5701
02:33:53.881 --> 02:33:54.310
<v Speaker 4>the tour,</v>

5702
02:33:54.310 --> 02:33:56.610
<v Speaker 4>the U S Army and Donald Rumsfeld,</v>

5703
02:33:56.611 --> 02:33:57.450
<v Speaker 4>new assholes.</v>

5704
02:33:57.690 --> 02:33:58.091
<v Speaker 4>So you,</v>

5705
02:33:58.091 --> 02:34:00.170
<v Speaker 4>you publish it in from the Wilderness.</v>

5706
02:34:00.530 --> 02:34:00.810
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

5707
02:34:00.810 --> 02:34:02.310
<v Speaker 4>it's still on the website to this day.</v>

5708
02:34:02.311 --> 02:34:03.031
<v Speaker 4>All seven parts.</v>

5709
02:34:03.031 --> 02:34:04.600
<v Speaker 4>And when we were in the Er,</v>

5710
02:34:04.740 --> 02:34:06.150
<v Speaker 4>just ready to publish part five,</v>

5711
02:34:06.151 --> 02:34:08.130
<v Speaker 4>my offices were burglarized.</v>

5712
02:34:08.131 --> 02:34:10.050
<v Speaker 4>All seven of my computers were smashed.</v>

5713
02:34:10.051 --> 02:34:10.740
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

5714
02:34:10.740 --> 02:34:12.480
<v Speaker 4>one of my employees turned out of woman,</v>

5715
02:34:12.481 --> 02:34:15.330
<v Speaker 4>turned out to be trying to set me up on a sexual harassment charge.</v>

5716

<v Speaker 6>Sucralose is hair.</v>

5805
02:36:07.720 --> 02:36:08.280
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I got it.</v>

5809
02:36:10.240 --> 02:36:12.850
<v Speaker 4>I was sick for probably a full year after I came.</v>

5810
02:36:12.851 --> 02:36:13.684

02:36:17.620 --> 02:36:19.540
<v Speaker 4>you got to death's door essentially,</v>

5815
02:36:19.580 --> 02:36:21.300
<v Speaker 4>and there was nothing they could do to save you,</v>

5816
02:36:21.390 --> 02:36:23.680
<v Speaker 4>then nobody knew what the fuck are the Cuban doctors is.</v>

5817
02:36:23.681 --> 02:36:24.790
<v Speaker 4>We don't know what's causing this.</v>

02:36:27.790 --> 02:36:31.720
<v Speaker 4>But we got Tillman out and Tillman was published and right after Donald Rumsfeld</v>

5822
02:36:31.721 --> 02:36:32.081
<v Speaker 4>resigned,</v>

02:37:30.440 --> 02:37:31.273
<v Speaker 4>my friend,</v>

02:37:32.541 --> 02:37:34.550
<v Speaker 4>former black congresswoman from Georgia,</v>

02:37:34.670 --> 02:37:35.503
<v Speaker 4>Atlanta,</v>

02:37:35.660 --> 02:37:36.493
<v Speaker 4>very dear friend,</v>

5873
02:37:36.530 --> 02:37:38.630
<v Speaker 4>she was the Green party nominee in,</v>

5874
02:37:38.720 --> 02:37:41.630
<v Speaker 4>and she mentioned that she might like to have me be a running mate in 2008.</v>

5875
02:37:41.670 --> 02:37:41.871
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

5876
02:37:41.871 --> 02:37:42.890
<v Speaker 4>are you out of your mind?</v>

5877
02:37:43.400 --> 02:37:44.510
<v Speaker 4>But that's when I decided,</v>

5878
02:37:44.570 --> 02:37:44.960
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

5879
02:37:44.960 --> 02:37:47.450
<v Speaker 4>we need a presidential energy policy.</v>

5880
02:37:47.451 --> 02:37:50.630
<v Speaker 4>This needs to get put into the peak oil and all the issues about this.</v>

5881
02:37:50.631 --> 02:37:52.670
<v Speaker 4>And that became my book confronting collapse.</v>

5882
02:37:53.210 --> 02:37:56.810
<v Speaker 4>But then Chris Smith showed up from blue mark films also in February of</v>

02:37:56.811 --> 02:37:57.644
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] nine,</v>

02:37:58.440 --> 02:37:59.001

02:37:59.001 --> 02:37:59.151
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

02:37:59.151 --> 02:38:01.440
<v Speaker 4>we'd Kinda like to make a movie what's going on in it,</v>

5888
02:38:01.441 --> 02:38:01.630
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

5889
02:38:01.630 --> 02:38:02.451
<v Speaker 1>Compelling movie.</v>

5890
02:38:02.451 --> 02:38:03.580
<v Speaker 1>And you think about a man who,</v>

5891
02:38:03.581 --> 02:38:07.300
<v Speaker 1>when the last time you saw a movie where a dude just talks for 90 minutes,</v>

5892
02:38:07.780 --> 02:38:08.810
<v Speaker 1>pretty fucking amazing.</v>

5893
02:38:08.811 --> 02:38:11.250
<v Speaker 1>And you can carry a movie like that and not just carry,</v>

5894
02:38:11.270 --> 02:38:14.770
<v Speaker 1>but it was really entertaining as well as fucking terrifying.</v>

02:38:15.010 --> 02:38:15.550
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

02:38:17.800 --> 02:38:20.140
<v Speaker 4>Each shoot was about 12 to 14 hours on set.</v>

5898
02:38:20.141 --> 02:38:21.300
<v Speaker 4>It was a full Hollywood shoe.</v>

5899
02:38:21.450 --> 02:38:23.860
<v Speaker 1>So you would just drink coffee and smoke cigarettes and rant.</v>

5907
02:38:33.740 --> 02:38:34.790
<v Speaker 4>They bring in a blanket,</v>

5909
02:38:37.060 --> 02:38:40.570
<v Speaker 1>came back and then pull it out and then start shooting again once when I was,</v>

<v Speaker 1>information?</v>

5942

<v Speaker 4>school of spiritual level ocean.</v>

5945
02:39:40.830 --> 02:39:45.830
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's like I have no doubt that something larger than me tapped me and,</v>

5946
02:39:47.821 --> 02:39:48.300
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

5947

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5949
02:39:50.610 --> 02:39:51.001
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

5950
02:39:51.001 --> 02:39:54.780
<v Speaker 4>and has kept me and sustain me and really kind of made jokes of any other plans</v>

5951
02:39:54.781 --> 02:39:57.240
<v Speaker 4>that I had along the way for what I thought I wanted to do with my life.</v>

5952
02:39:58.040 --> 02:39:58.440
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5953
02:39:58.440 --> 02:40:00.870
<v Speaker 4>and I'm really aware of that now and I'm living that,</v>

5954
02:40:00.871 --> 02:40:01.111
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5955
02:40:01.111 --> 02:40:03.210
<v Speaker 4>spiritually connected to the fact that,</v>

5956
02:40:03.680 --> 02:40:04.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5957
02:40:04.080 --> 02:40:06.360
<v Speaker 4>there is something really good out here.</v>

5958
02:40:06.361 --> 02:40:11.361
<v Speaker 4>There is something that's showing itself on this planet now that's just in that</v>

5959
02:40:11.701 --> 02:40:12.960
<v Speaker 4>it's fair and that it's loving.</v>

5960
02:40:13.110 --> 02:40:14.100
<v Speaker 4>It does have power,</v>

5961
02:40:14.101 --> 02:40:14.581
<v Speaker 4>I'm seeing.</v>

5962
02:40:14.581 --> 02:40:15.060
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>

5963
02:40:15.060 --> 02:40:16.650
<v Speaker 4>It's like watching the matrix,</v>

5964
02:40:16.651 --> 02:40:16.831
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5965
02:40:16.831 --> 02:40:17.370
<v Speaker 4>when the,</v>

5966
02:40:17.370 --> 02:40:20.730
<v Speaker 4>when the Matrix start on that little bits of light start coming through and,</v>

5967
02:40:20.731 --> 02:40:20.881
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

5968
02:40:20.881 --> 02:40:21.960
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

5969
02:40:21.961 --> 02:40:24.600
<v Speaker 4>and all these people out here in the world right now,</v>

5970
02:40:24.720 --> 02:40:28.260
<v Speaker 4>they're living in a matrix that's falling apart exactly like it did in the</v>

5971
02:40:28.261 --> 02:40:28.621
<v Speaker 4>movie.</v>

5972
02:40:28.621 --> 02:40:29.040
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

5973
02:40:29.040 --> 02:40:29.131
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

5974
02:40:29.131 --> 02:40:29.540
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>

5975
02:40:29.540 --> 02:40:31.200
<v Speaker 4>that there's a big hole in that building over there.</v>

5976
02:40:31.201 --> 02:40:32.010
<v Speaker 4>And there's this,</v>

5977
02:40:32.010 --> 02:40:34.800
<v Speaker 4>that's metaphorically what we're seeing happen all around us.</v>

5978
02:40:35.310 --> 02:40:39.210
<v Speaker 4>And there's a lot of people who really get that they're in a matrix and are</v>

5979
02:40:39.211 --> 02:40:40.110
<v Speaker 4>starting to move out.</v>

5980
02:40:40.111 --> 02:40:43.800
<v Speaker 4>And there's others who are equally moved to try and go back and reinforce it.</v>

5981
02:40:44.640 --> 02:40:46.350
<v Speaker 4>And those are people making their own choices.</v>

5982
02:40:46.351 --> 02:40:47.700
<v Speaker 4>I think about which way they're going to go.</v>

5983
02:40:48.440 --> 02:40:50.420
<v Speaker 1>So you're not pessimistic,</v>

5984
02:40:50.421 --> 02:40:51.440
<v Speaker 1>you're optimistic.</v>

5985
02:40:51.441 --> 02:40:53.960
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people might think that you're a doom and gloom guy,</v>

5986
02:40:54.230 --> 02:40:55.550
<v Speaker 1>but you're now you're know you're,</v>

5987
02:40:55.551 --> 02:40:55.881
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

5988
02:40:55.881 --> 02:40:56.631
<v Speaker 1>let's be happy.</v>

5989
02:40:56.631 --> 02:40:58.190
<v Speaker 1>We're going to get rid of the bad system.</v>

5990
02:40:58.220 --> 02:40:59.420
<v Speaker 1>We're going to get rid of the bad guy.</v>

5991
02:40:59.460 --> 02:41:01.890
<v Speaker 4>There is a balancing that is taking place.</v>

5992
02:41:02.400 --> 02:41:03.540
<v Speaker 4>It's long overdue.</v>

5993
02:41:03.810 --> 02:41:04.643
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

5994
02:41:04.700 --> 02:41:06.420
<v Speaker 4>it's as a doc holiday would say.</v>

5995
02:41:06.421 --> 02:41:07.254
<v Speaker 4>It's a reckoning.</v>

5996
02:41:07.340 --> 02:41:08.810
<v Speaker 1>What an amazing time to be alive.</v>

5997
02:41:09.160 --> 02:41:09.531
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5998
02:41:09.531 --> 02:41:10.310
<v Speaker 1>it really is.</v>

5999
02:41:10.310 --> 02:41:12.110
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing time to be,</v>

6000
02:41:12.130 --> 02:41:12.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6001
02:41:12.500 --> 02:41:16.040
<v Speaker 1>at the point in human history and the history of this planet and the history of,</v>

6002
02:41:16.070 --> 02:41:16.903
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6003
02:41:17.690 --> 02:41:18.021
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

6004
02:41:18.021 --> 02:41:21.320
<v Speaker 1>it's all very strange that it's all taking place in our lifetime right now.</v>

6005
02:41:21.380 --> 02:41:23.000
<v Speaker 1>And this is a really,</v>

6006
02:41:23.090 --> 02:41:24.170
<v Speaker 1>it's an amazing moment.</v>

6007
02:41:24.200 --> 02:41:25.033
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6008
02:41:25.070 --> 02:41:25.821
<v Speaker 1>I hope we get through it.</v>

6009
02:41:25.821 --> 02:41:26.654
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

6010
02:41:26.690 --> 02:41:29.270
<v Speaker 4>I hope we all keep our eyes open because,</v>

6011
02:41:29.271 --> 02:41:30.020
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6012
02:41:30.020 --> 02:41:30.380
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6013
02:41:30.380 --> 02:41:32.090
<v Speaker 4>even though these are the darkest of times,</v>

6014
02:41:32.091 --> 02:41:35.600
<v Speaker 4>this is also an age of miracles and we need to just keep ourselves open to the</v>

6015
02:41:35.601 --> 02:41:39.020
<v Speaker 4>expectation that good things can happen without our permission.</v>

6016
02:41:39.021 --> 02:41:39.890
<v Speaker 4>And there's wisdoms.</v>

6017
02:41:39.950 --> 02:41:40.310
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

6018
02:41:40.310 --> 02:41:40.551
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6019
02:41:40.551 --> 02:41:42.470
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of other wisdom out here in this.</v>

6020
02:41:43.070 --> 02:41:45.530
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of light shone through and that's one of the reasons why occupied.</v>

6021
02:41:45.550 --> 02:41:46.280
<v Speaker 4>Just just,</v>

6022
02:41:46.280 --> 02:41:46.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6023
02:41:46.670 --> 02:41:47.720
<v Speaker 4>makes my toes wiggle.</v>

6024
02:41:47.840 --> 02:41:50.840
<v Speaker 1>There's never been a time in human history where the access to information is</v>

6025
02:41:50.841 --> 02:41:51.261
<v Speaker 1>easier.</v>

6026
02:41:51.261 --> 02:41:53.030
<v Speaker 1>And when the access to information is easy,</v>

6027
02:41:53.031 --> 02:41:54.140
<v Speaker 1>people can get the truth out.</v>

6028
02:41:54.141 --> 02:41:57.980
<v Speaker 1>When people can get the truth out and they can get ideas out and they can get an</v>

6029
02:41:57.981 --> 02:42:01.250
<v Speaker 1>ideology of happiness and of sustaining your,</v>

6030
02:42:01.251 --> 02:42:01.521
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

6031
02:42:01.521 --> 02:42:01.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6032
02:42:01.790 --> 02:42:03.140
<v Speaker 1>your environment and of,</v>

6033
02:42:03.141 --> 02:42:03.440
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

6034
02:42:03.440 --> 02:42:07.820
<v Speaker 1>of subsistence and of a community and of love and friendship,</v>

6035
02:42:08.060 --> 02:42:09.740
<v Speaker 1>it's very possible to foster that and grow.</v>

6036
02:42:09.770 --> 02:42:09.951
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6037
02:42:09.951 --> 02:42:11.420
<v Speaker 1>we don't have to all be conquerors.</v>

6038
02:42:11.570 --> 02:42:14.060
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to be all caught raping the world.</v>

6039
02:42:14.090 --> 02:42:15.110
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to be that way.</v>

6040
02:42:15.111 --> 02:42:15.400
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

6041
02:42:15.400 --> 02:42:15.890
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6042
02:42:15.890 --> 02:42:19.040
<v Speaker 1>We can just be human beings and enjoy our time here because it is in fact</v>

6043
02:42:19.190 --> 02:42:24.020
<v Speaker 1>temporary and like all sorts of patterns of behavior that people get stuck in,</v>

6044
02:42:24.021 --> 02:42:28.370
<v Speaker 1>whether it's fucking gambling or excessive masturbation or whatever the fuck you</v>

6045
02:42:28.371 --> 02:42:29.204
<v Speaker 1>get hooked on.</v>

6046
02:42:29.270 --> 02:42:30.980
<v Speaker 1>You can also get hooked on running the world.</v>

6047
02:42:31.160 --> 02:42:33.080
<v Speaker 1>You can also get hooked on fucking over the world.</v>

6048
02:42:33.081 --> 02:42:34.070
<v Speaker 1>So these people are sick.</v>

6049
02:42:34.550 --> 02:42:35.180

6050
02:42:35.180 --> 02:42:36.190
