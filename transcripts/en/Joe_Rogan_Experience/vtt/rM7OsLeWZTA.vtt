<v Speaker 1>their mom to write and they shoot the</v>

<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.820
<v Speaker 1>He killed them outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But every time you go home you have to</v>

120
00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:25.420
<v Speaker 1>step over a crime scene to walk into</v>
<v Speaker 1>your house</v>

121
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.350
<v Speaker 1>and you've seen the pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

122
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.790
<v Speaker 1>You know the history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time Oj documentary comes out or</v>

123
00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:38.791
<v Speaker 1>every time they have an Oj series on tv</v>
<v Speaker 1>or when his a parole hearing comes up,</v>

124
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.050
<v Speaker 1>you're like walking through the doorway</v>
<v Speaker 1>into that house.</v>

125
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.730
<v Speaker 1>So I wonder if like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to the person who's like,</v>

126
00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.860
<v Speaker 1>doesn't give a fuck and listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that motherfucker,</v>

127
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.260
<v Speaker 1>he don't say</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal baby.</v>

128
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.670
<v Speaker 1>Bat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sprint would listen.</v>

129
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.460
<v Speaker 1>She should have been nicer dorms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan,</v>

130
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.040
<v Speaker 1>did you ever see the autopsy photos?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

131
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.290
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

132
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.700
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

133
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.080
<v Speaker 1>it's not worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get it.</v>

134
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.150
<v Speaker 1>I saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A murder scene.</v>

135
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:17.270
<v Speaker 1>Photos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just so hard to believe that</v>

136
00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:18.860
<v Speaker 1>someone could do that to someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

137
00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:20.930
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they cared about that they had babies</v>

138
00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:21.764
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

139
00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.980
<v Speaker 1>It's just people get crazy game of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thrones out here,</v>

140
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.270
<v Speaker 1>but just rarely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

141
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like every week it's the game of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thrones.</v>

142
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.530
<v Speaker 1>It's normal</v>

143
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.270
<v Speaker 2>and a Jonathan Hyde who's a social</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologist over it and why you heat</v>

144
00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:36.670
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A really good piece for the Atlantic in</v>

145
00:06:36.671 --> 00:06:40.450
<v Speaker 2>2015 about this phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this kind of safe space trigger warning</v>

146
00:06:40.451 --> 00:06:43.420
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this idea that you must never be forced</v>

147
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.090
<v Speaker 2>into a position where someone has an</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that opposes yours,</v>

148
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.040
<v Speaker 2>and what he said is it basically makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>people crazy.</v>

149
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.690
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It actually makes you crazy that that</v>

150
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.890
<v Speaker 2>the idea in psychology is that if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a chain of thoughts leading to a</v>

151
00:06:53.891 --> 00:06:55.090
<v Speaker 2>bad outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're depressed,</v>

152
00:06:55.091 --> 00:06:55.811
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If your depressive,</v>

153
00:06:55.811 --> 00:06:57.670
<v Speaker 2>then you have a chain of thoughts</v>
<v Speaker 2>leading to a bad outcome.</v>

154
00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.370
<v Speaker 2>The way that psychologists deal with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is with cognitive behavioral</v>

155
00:07:00.371 --> 00:07:01.031
<v Speaker 2>therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>

156
00:07:01.031 --> 00:07:02.500
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in this chain of thoughts.</v>

157
00:07:02.501 --> 00:07:04.660
<v Speaker 2>Are you going wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you attributing to somebody a motive</v>

158
00:07:04.661 --> 00:07:05.491
<v Speaker 2>they don't have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

159
00:07:05.491 --> 00:07:09.310
<v Speaker 2>Is your wife really being nasty or is it</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just attributing nasty to her and</v>

160
00:07:09.311 --> 00:07:11.380
<v Speaker 2>that's why you're getting depressed or</v>
<v Speaker 2>spinning off,</v>

161
00:07:11.381 --> 00:07:11.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

162
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.330
<v Speaker 2>Try to control your own chain of</v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts.</v>

163
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.880
<v Speaker 2>What the microaggression trigger warning</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture does is it actually grants vow.</v>

164
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.230
<v Speaker 2>The more you are offended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more value you are granted and</v>

165
00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:22.450
<v Speaker 2>therefore you have actually an interest</v>
<v Speaker 2>in being offended.</v>

166
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.400
<v Speaker 2>We give you awards if you're offended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

167
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:25.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your your treasured.</v>

168
00:07:25.631 --> 00:07:27.940
<v Speaker 2>If you're offended because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>demonstrates that you're woke,</v>

169
00:07:27.941 --> 00:07:28.420
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

170
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.060
<v Speaker 2>the more you are offended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more we can show that you are woke</v>

171
00:07:31.061 --> 00:07:34.360
<v Speaker 2>and because you are woke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Therefore your granted this virtue,</v>

172
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.460
<v Speaker 2>you get to Lord it over everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I say in my speeches,</v>

173
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.720
<v Speaker 2>if we could somehow identify like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>lgbt half black,</v>

174
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.200
<v Speaker 2>half Hispanic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one quarter native American little</v>

175
00:07:44.201 --> 00:07:45.160
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

176
00:07:45.161 --> 00:07:48.290
<v Speaker 2>then we would finally have the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person who we could go to dance for</v>

177
00:07:48.291 --> 00:07:50.500
<v Speaker 2>all of our questions because their</v>
<v Speaker 2>identity would be unquestionable.</v>

178
00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:51.790
<v Speaker 2>It'd be Yoda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

179
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.310
<v Speaker 2>If we could find Yoda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could just get rid of democracy and</v>

180
00:07:54.311 --> 00:07:56.650
<v Speaker 2>discussion all together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can just rule from on high.</v>

181
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:57.440
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

182
00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to put a gender on Yoda,</v>

183
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:00.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Yoda is gender.</v>

184
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:03.030
<v Speaker 1>It is Yoda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does he do it right?</v>

185
00:08:03.031 --> 00:08:06.890
<v Speaker 1>It's gotta be a guy with deep voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we're being rude by incidents,</v>

186
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:08.810
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're absolutely right.</v>

187
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.810
<v Speaker 1>There's no one is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one's left enough.</v>

188
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:12.631
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

189
00:08:12.631 --> 00:08:13.464
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

190
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where the limit is a and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's there so far left that they've</v>

191
00:08:16.991 --> 00:08:19.030
<v Speaker 2>actually made common cause with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people they hate.</v>

192
00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:20.900
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when they talk about safe spaces and</v>

193
00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:24.190
<v Speaker 2>is w w it misery it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these black students protesting and</v>

194
00:08:24.191 --> 00:08:27.730
<v Speaker 2>they actually said we don't want white</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who think like us and who want to</v>

195
00:08:27.731 --> 00:08:30.490
<v Speaker 2>help us in our safe spaces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We feel insulted by that.</v>

196
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.010
<v Speaker 2>I just thought to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the KKK agrees.</v>

197
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.740
<v Speaker 2>Like if you want to do safe spaces for</v>
<v Speaker 2>separate races,</v>

198
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.880
<v Speaker 2>I can find some Jim crow racist or</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally up for that from like 1962</v>

199
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:42.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the really bizarre statement</v>

200
00:08:42.351 --> 00:08:45.830
<v Speaker 1>that I've heard over and over again that</v>
<v Speaker 1>black people cannot be racist against</v>

201
00:08:45.831 --> 00:08:47.990
<v Speaker 1>white people because they don't have any</v>
<v Speaker 1>power over white people.</v>

202
00:08:47.991 --> 00:08:51.500
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

203
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:52.603
<v Speaker 1>Which is just,</v>

204
00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:53.561
<v Speaker 2>it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an eight.</v>

205
00:08:53.561 --> 00:08:54.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an inane statement.</v>

206
00:08:54.731 --> 00:08:58.260
<v Speaker 2>The this that you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to have power in the</v>

207
00:08:58.261 --> 00:09:00.390
<v Speaker 2>superstructure in order for you to even</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be raised.</v>

208
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.890
<v Speaker 2>I can understand the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they said,</v>

209
00:09:01.891 --> 00:09:04.200
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you being racist is not connected to</v>

210
00:09:04.201 --> 00:09:06.390
<v Speaker 2>racist action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have the capacity for</v>

211
00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:09.810
<v Speaker 2>action that affects people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then your personal racism is not as</v>

212
00:09:09.811 --> 00:09:11.550
<v Speaker 2>important as the racism of people in</v>
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

213
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:16.410
<v Speaker 2>Then at least as an argument or the idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can't be racist at all if</v>

214
00:09:16.411 --> 00:09:18.210
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're black because black people</v>

215
00:09:18.211 --> 00:09:19.380
<v Speaker 2>don't have enough pat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

216
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:23.370
<v Speaker 2>the idea that black people have no power</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the United States is utterly crazy.</v>

217
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's utterly crazy.</v>

218
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when it was going on.</v>

219
00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.780
<v Speaker 2>Alabama was president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The attorney general was the president,</v>

220
00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.330
<v Speaker 2>and I always said this about Baltimore.</v>

221
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:31.950
<v Speaker 2>We kept hearing you in Baltimore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

222
00:09:31.951 --> 00:09:33.130
<v Speaker 2>where they had the riots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd bought wood,</v>

223
00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.320
<v Speaker 2>they had riots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were saying,</v>

224
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:35.520
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Baltimore PD,</v>

225
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:36.001
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

226
00:09:36.001 --> 00:09:39.060
<v Speaker 2>they're cracking down on black people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get the chief of police was black.</v>

227
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.460
<v Speaker 2>The majority of the city council was</v>
<v Speaker 2>black and Democrat.</v>

228
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:42.670
<v Speaker 2>The entire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

229
00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.540
<v Speaker 2>the deputy district attorney who was</v>
<v Speaker 2>prosecuting the case was black.</v>

230
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.670
<v Speaker 2>The majority of the police department</v>
<v Speaker 2>was minority.</v>

231
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:49.440
<v Speaker 2>The attorney general of the United</v>
<v Speaker 2>States was black,</v>

232
00:09:49.441 --> 00:09:51.030
<v Speaker 2>and the president of the United States</v>
<v Speaker 2>was black.</v>

233
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.670
<v Speaker 2>But the majority of the city of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Baltimore is black.</v>

234
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:54.960
<v Speaker 2>But apparently it's the white guy's</v>
