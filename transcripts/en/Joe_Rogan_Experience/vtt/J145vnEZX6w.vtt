00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:06.980
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy in.</v>

4
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.370
<v Speaker 1>Hi there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome.</v>

5
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.570
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for doing this.</v>

6
00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:11.430
<v Speaker 1>I really appreciate it and I love what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing.</v>

7
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.790
<v Speaker 1>I've seen your Ted Talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen many in numerous conferences </v>

8
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.751
<v Speaker 1>that you've appeared at and discussions </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've given on this and for people to </v>

9
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.820
<v Speaker 1>jump into this right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you've done is think long and hard </v>

10
00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:30.981
<v Speaker 1>and devise a method to try to clean up </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the plastic that we have </v>

11
00:00:30.981 --> 00:00:32.730
<v Speaker 1>floating around in the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Famously,</v>

12
00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:36.840
<v Speaker 1>the Pacific garbage patch is this </v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous patch of garbage that's between</v>

13
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.140
<v Speaker 1>California and Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did you get involved in this and </v>

14
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.140
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

15
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.110
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a young guy.</v>

16
00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:44.760
<v Speaker 1>How old are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty three.</v>

17
00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:46.470
<v Speaker 1>Already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty three already.</v>

18
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.880
<v Speaker 1>You sound like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

19
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.520
<v Speaker 1>How old were you when you started this?</v>

20
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.300
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

21
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.350
<v Speaker 2>I think I started thinking about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was 16 and I found that this </v>

22
00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.350
<v Speaker 2>organization when I was 18,</v>

23
00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.670
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you lazy fucks out there that are 16</v>

24
00:01:00.671 --> 00:01:02.320
<v Speaker 1>years old that aren't doing shit with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>

25
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.810
<v Speaker 1>Just think about this kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

26
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's people like you in the world.</v>

27
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.570
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

28
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you started thinking about it when </v>

29
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.761
<v Speaker 1>you were 16 and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something that is extremely </v>

30
00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:15.550
<v Speaker 1>disturbing to anybody that's paid </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>

31
00:01:15.551 --> 00:01:20.551
<v Speaker 1>especially when you see the birds that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have died with all these plastic bottle </v>

32
00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:24.271
<v Speaker 1>caps inside their bodies and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see their carcasses with these </v>

33
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:26.440
<v Speaker 1>multicolored caps in them and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought these things were food.</v>

34
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.250
<v Speaker 1>It was just one of the many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

35
00:01:30.251 --> 00:01:35.251
<v Speaker 1>many problems that occur when you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>plastic floating around and just </v>

36
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.630
<v Speaker 1>enormous numbers and the ocean.</v>

37
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.740
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

38
00:01:38.741 --> 00:01:40.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's really three problems </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this plastic.</v>

39
00:01:40.661 --> 00:01:43.300
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously the ecosystem damage.</v>

40
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.330
<v Speaker 2>I think they're right about 800 species </v>
<v Speaker 2>that actually could go extinct because </v>

41
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.681
<v Speaker 2>of this plastic pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the economic threat in </v>

42
00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:56.881
<v Speaker 2>terms of damage to fisheries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>damage to tourism and things like that.</v>

43
00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.060
<v Speaker 2>I think it's around $13 billion dollars </v>
<v Speaker 2>a year according to the UN.</v>

44
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.510
<v Speaker 2>And then thirdly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the health impact or the </v>

45
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.880
<v Speaker 2>potential health impact because these </v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny plastic pieces,</v>

46
00:02:06.881 --> 00:02:09.220
<v Speaker 2>they actually ended up in the fish we </v>
<v Speaker 2>eat,</v>

47
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that take chemicals with it.</v>

48
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.310
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

49
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.310
<v Speaker 2>that ends up on our dinner plate as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

50
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.830
<v Speaker 1>So what was it that prompted you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>dedicate,</v>

51
00:02:19.831 --> 00:02:21.720
<v Speaker 1>essentially dedicate your young life to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

52
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.950
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

53
00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:27.951
<v Speaker 2>So I've always been very passionate </v>
<v Speaker 2>about technology and just building </v>

54
00:02:27.951 --> 00:02:32.781
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think sort of having an idea in your </v>

55
00:02:32.781 --> 00:02:35.301
<v Speaker 2>mind and then seeing that become reality</v>
<v Speaker 2>and be able to touch it and things like </v>

56
00:02:35.301 --> 00:02:35.301
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

57
00:02:35.301 --> 00:02:39.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's literally no better feeling in </v>

58
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:40.320
<v Speaker 2>the world than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've been building my own thing since</v>

59
00:02:40.321 --> 00:02:45.321
<v Speaker 2>it was two years old I think for </v>
<v Speaker 2>starting with things like tree houses </v>

60
00:02:45.321 --> 00:02:49.401
<v Speaker 2>and zip lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then going into sort of computers </v>

61
00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:50.370
<v Speaker 2>and explosives and rockets and things </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

62
00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:54.030
<v Speaker 2>which was a lot of fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't very useful I would say.</v>

63
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's kind of looking for something,</v>

64
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.430
<v Speaker 2>sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that real to,</v>

65
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.690
<v Speaker 2>to work on a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I then came across when </v>

66
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.580
<v Speaker 2>I was 16 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was scuba diving in Greece and I came</v>

67
00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:10.330
<v Speaker 2>across more plastic bags of fish and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wondered why can we just clean this up?</v>

68
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.390
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that question sort of kept circling </v>

69
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.420
<v Speaker 2>around in my head and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

70
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 2>I sort of thought about how could we do </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

71
00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:21.820
<v Speaker 2>The ocean is pretty big and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually came up with there's a dod to</v>

72
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 2>use these natural ocean currents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

73
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:25.960
<v Speaker 2>to let us collect the plastic.</v>

74
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.300
<v Speaker 3>And so how do you have many different </v>
<v Speaker 3>prototypes?</v>

75
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.070
<v Speaker 3>Did you started with and you eventually </v>
<v Speaker 3>wound up with what you have now and have</v>

76
00:03:35.071 --> 00:03:36.210
<v Speaker 3>you started implementing them yet?</v>

77
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

78
00:03:37.161 --> 00:03:42.161
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the concept that was presented back in </v>

79
00:03:42.161 --> 00:03:46.060
<v Speaker 2>2012 with my first tedx stoke and if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>compare that to where we are right now,</v>

80
00:03:47.481 --> 00:03:50.210
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of day and night of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference.</v>

81
00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:51.700
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

82
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.730
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through testing and through all these </v>

83
00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.730
<v Speaker 2>prototypings um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

84
00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.760
<v Speaker 2>obviously there has been a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>development there,</v>

85
00:03:58.761 --> 00:04:03.761
<v Speaker 2>but the key idea has stayed the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That instead of going after the plastic </v>

86
00:04:03.761 --> 00:04:07.070
<v Speaker 2>with boats and nets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which will take roundabout 79,000</v>

87
00:04:07.071 --> 00:04:09.920
<v Speaker 2>years to clean up just as great pacific </v>
<v Speaker 2>garbage patch.</v>

88
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.500
<v Speaker 2>Instead of doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we let the plastic come to us.</v>

89
00:04:12.501 --> 00:04:14.720
<v Speaker 2>So we use a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically in network,</v>

90
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.750
<v Speaker 2>a fleet of very long floating barriers </v>
<v Speaker 2>which are oriented in a u shape and they</v>

91
00:04:19.761 --> 00:04:22.690
<v Speaker 2>float around and they kind of act like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive pacman.</v>

92
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:23.960
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

93
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.860
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

94
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.150
<v Speaker 2>like a funnel brings the plastic towards</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

95
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.600
<v Speaker 2>the network ocean currents push it </v>
<v Speaker 2>against,</v>

96
00:04:29.601 --> 00:04:31.280
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>moves towards the center,</v>

97
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.490
<v Speaker 2>becomes very concentrated and wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrated well then it's easy to get </v>

98
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.280
<v Speaker 2>it out and ship it to land for </v>
<v Speaker 2>recycling.</v>

99
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.300
<v Speaker 2>It has this started yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

100
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.350
<v Speaker 2>so with the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we were founded four years ago in </v>

101
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.850
<v Speaker 2>that time on one side we did the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reconnaissance,</v>

102
00:04:46.851 --> 00:04:51.851
<v Speaker 2>so we mapped the patch with 30 boats and</v>
<v Speaker 2>an airplane at the same time to really </v>

103
00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:56.891
<v Speaker 2>understand how much is out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which turns out to be one point 8 </v>

104
00:04:56.891 --> 00:04:57.890
<v Speaker 2>trillion pieces floating in this great </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pacific garbage patch.</v>

105
00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.420
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and on the other hand,</v>

106
00:04:59.421 --> 00:05:04.421
<v Speaker 2>we've done all the testing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've done hundreds of scale model </v>

107
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:08.111
<v Speaker 2>tests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've done prototypes back in Europe on </v>

108
00:05:08.111 --> 00:05:11.240
<v Speaker 2>the Nazi and actually right now we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're manufacturing the first real </v>

109
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.821
<v Speaker 2>cleanup system which is scheduled to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>launched from San Francisco to the Great</v>

110
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.040
<v Speaker 2>Pacific garbage patch around two or </v>
<v Speaker 2>three months time.</v>

111
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.160
<v Speaker 3>So has anything been used,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like is there a proof of concept of have</v>

112
00:05:24.161 --> 00:05:29.161
<v Speaker 3>you done like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>real large scale testing where you've </v>

113
00:05:29.161 --> 00:05:29.320
<v Speaker 3>shown that you can actually do this?</v>

114
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we've done a lot of subsystem </v>

115
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.670
<v Speaker 2>testing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>

116
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.670
<v Speaker 2>the prototypes in the North Sea for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

117
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:39.261
<v Speaker 2>where there were these 12 meters </v>
<v Speaker 2>sections and we managed though to keep </v>

118
00:05:39.261 --> 00:05:39.810
<v Speaker 2>that in one piece.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

119
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then also the plastic capturing that</v>

120
00:05:42.931 --> 00:05:44.950
<v Speaker 2>worked very well in the lab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

121
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.030
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

122
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.050
<v Speaker 2>the real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real proof of course has to come </v>

123
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.231
<v Speaker 2>from this one real system in the great </v>
<v Speaker 2>pacific garbage patch collecting </v>

124
00:05:54.231 --> 00:05:58.071
<v Speaker 2>plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what we really hope to </v>

125
00:05:58.071 --> 00:05:58.071
<v Speaker 2>achieve this year.</v>

126
00:05:58.071 --> 00:05:58.071
<v Speaker 3>So this is the one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

127
00:05:58.071 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 3>The Great Pacific</v>

128
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.930
<v Speaker 2>garbage patch is the largest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

129
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.450
<v Speaker 2>because cal between California and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hawaii.</v>

130
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.160
<v Speaker 2>Hawaiian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

131
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.180
<v Speaker 2>So the five areas in the world where our</v>
<v Speaker 2>plastic concentrates a,</v>

132
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.100
<v Speaker 2>this is by far the largest one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore others,</v>

133
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they are,</v>

134
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.280
<v Speaker 2>they combined Lee a contain less plastic</v>
<v Speaker 2>than this one in the,</v>

135
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.400
<v Speaker 2>in the nurses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do we know what it is?</v>

136
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.240
<v Speaker 2>Probably because of Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Asia has,</v>

137
00:06:22.241 --> 00:06:24.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has quite a big problem in terms of that</v>

138
00:06:24.071 --> 00:06:25.960
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they use a lot of plastic but they don't</v>

139
00:06:25.961 --> 00:06:30.961
<v Speaker 2>have a good infrastructure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So by far the largest source of plastic </v>

140
00:06:30.961 --> 00:06:32.480
<v Speaker 2>flowing into the ocean is also this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

141
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.540
<v Speaker 2>there's one continent and what's being </v>
<v Speaker 2>released,</v>

142
00:06:34.541 --> 00:06:38.410
<v Speaker 2>they're naturally by because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>currents ends up in the North Pacific.</v>

143
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.720
<v Speaker 3>It's such a strange problem because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't something that was discussed in </v>

144
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.920
<v Speaker 3>the eighties and the nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was nothing.</v>

145
00:06:45.921 --> 00:06:48.410
<v Speaker 3>And then all of the sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere in the year 2000,</v>

146
00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:53.411
<v Speaker 3>I remember hearing about the massive </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of plastic we have in the ocean </v>

147
00:06:53.411 --> 00:06:53.570
<v Speaker 3>and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just made sense.</v>

148
00:06:53.571 --> 00:06:54.080
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

149
00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:56.360
<v Speaker 3>well of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course it's going to wind up there.</v>

150
00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.970
<v Speaker 3>But the sheer size of it is staggering.</v>

151
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:04.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that to me the worrying </v>

152
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:05.420
<v Speaker 2>thing is that it's a persistent problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So with many other kinds of pollution,</v>

153
00:07:05.421 --> 00:07:09.260
<v Speaker 2>so when you sort of turn off the tap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's will be sold by itself.</v>

154
00:07:09.261 --> 00:07:10.280
<v Speaker 2>Think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

155
00:07:10.281 --> 00:07:12.800
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ozone hole with the cfcs,</v>

156
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with this,</v>

157
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.720
<v Speaker 2>like if you turn off the tap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is still there and in 100 </v>

158
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.530
<v Speaker 2>years it will still be there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think to really solve it,</v>

159
00:07:21.531 --> 00:07:23.210
<v Speaker 2>you need to do two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One site,</v>

160
00:07:23.211 --> 00:07:24.950
<v Speaker 2>we have to close the tap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>

161
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.060
<v Speaker 2>we also need to clean it up.</v>

162
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:31.270
<v Speaker 3>Jamie just pulled up a size comparison </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it shows one point 6 million </v>

163
00:07:33.201 --> 00:07:38.201
<v Speaker 3>square kilometers of area twice the size</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Texas or three times the size of </v>

164
00:07:38.201 --> 00:07:38.510
<v Speaker 3>France.</v>

165
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:43.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is a study we published a few a </v>

166
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.590
<v Speaker 2>few weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this was the result of the </v>

167
00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:46.590
<v Speaker 2>recognizance effort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

168
00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:51.240
<v Speaker 2>and it's kind of funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like every other news outlet used at </v>

169
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.840
<v Speaker 2>different size comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it was CNN that says,</v>

170
00:07:52.841 --> 00:07:54.920
<v Speaker 2>what's the size of Mongolia?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

171
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.460
<v Speaker 2>we always use Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

172
00:07:57.461 --> 00:08:02.461
<v Speaker 2>Texas is America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We use Texas for everything four times </v>

173
00:08:02.461 --> 00:08:03.010
<v Speaker 2>of California as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

174
00:08:03.011 --> 00:08:04.120
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty big area.</v>

175
00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:06.460
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's getting bigger,</v>

176
00:08:06.461 --> 00:08:07.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

177
00:08:07.541 --> 00:08:08.150
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

178
00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:09.910
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the area doesn't really change.</v>

179
00:08:09.911 --> 00:08:12.440
<v Speaker 2>It's more of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the concentration concentration of it.</v>

180
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:16.630
<v Speaker 2>When did we realize that this was an </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue like collectively scientists,</v>

181
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.050
<v Speaker 2>geologists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there hasn't been that have been sort</v>

182
00:08:20.051 --> 00:08:22.990
<v Speaker 2>of small sampling efforts since the </v>
<v Speaker 2>seventies.</v>

183
00:08:22.991 --> 00:08:26.800
<v Speaker 2>So back then it was the first time </v>
<v Speaker 2>plastic was described as being something</v>

184
00:08:26.801 --> 00:08:31.801
<v Speaker 2>that floats in the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it really only entered the public </v>

185
00:08:31.801 --> 00:08:35.311
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in the late nineties there was </v>

186
00:08:35.311 --> 00:08:35.311
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

187
00:08:35.311 --> 00:08:36.840
<v Speaker 2>this captain Charles Moore who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

188
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.060
<v Speaker 2>were sort of sailing through it and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>saw this plastic and he was like,</v>

189
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:43.000
<v Speaker 2>we need to describe this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he did a,</v>

190
00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:47.740
<v Speaker 2>a scientific paper on it and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And actually I think he was the one that</v>

191
00:08:47.741 --> 00:08:50.320
<v Speaker 2>turned the term great pacific garbage </v>
<v Speaker 2>patch.</v>

192
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.700
<v Speaker 2>He was riding his boat through it for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>long period of time,</v>

193
00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:55.620
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

194
00:08:55.621 --> 00:08:56.510
<v Speaker 2>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

195
00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.810
<v Speaker 2>it was participating in some sailing </v>
<v Speaker 2>race and he went through it and then,</v>

196
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:01.990
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just saw that.</v>

197
00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.370
<v Speaker 2>So he was the sort of the canary in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>coal mine,</v>

198
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:06.800
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

199
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:13.110
<v Speaker 1>What is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those things where it's hard to </v>

200
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.900
<v Speaker 1>get different governments to act on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

201
00:09:15.901 --> 00:09:17.010
<v Speaker 1>like who's responsible for it?</v>

202
00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:18.280
<v Speaker 2>The ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

203
00:09:18.281 --> 00:09:21.220
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a sort of tragic tragedy of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Commons,</v>

204
00:09:21.221 --> 00:09:23.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where it's international waters,</v>

205
00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:28.320
<v Speaker 2>sort of everyone's problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time legally it's no </v>

206
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:28.320
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

207
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:28.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

208
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:33.940
<v Speaker 2>and besides that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I really felt when I started the </v>

209
00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.690
<v Speaker 2>ocean cleanup was that I think everyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted this problem to be solved,</v>

210
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:40.510
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time we didn't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a way to do it.</v>

211
00:09:40.511 --> 00:09:44.230
<v Speaker 2>There was somebody wasn't any technology</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do that and that's why I thought,</v>

212
00:09:44.231 --> 00:09:48.220
<v Speaker 2>well perhaps this is an opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>combine my interests,</v>

213
00:09:48.221 --> 00:09:49.600
<v Speaker 2>have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>solving this problem,</v>

214
00:09:49.601 --> 00:09:52.000
<v Speaker 2>but b,</v>
<v Speaker 2>also developing technology,</v>

215
00:09:52.001 --> 00:09:54.550
<v Speaker 2>which is what we did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there anyone else doing this?</v>

216
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.510
<v Speaker 2>So there are many organizations working </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>

217
00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.960
<v Speaker 2>on the prevention insight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

218
00:09:58.961 --> 00:10:02.950
<v Speaker 2>So educating people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about policies,</v>

219
00:10:02.951 --> 00:10:05.500
<v Speaker 2>those kinds of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very important I think.</v>

220
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.540
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

221
00:10:06.541 --> 00:10:11.541
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately we're the only ones that </v>

222
00:10:11.541 --> 00:10:12.090
<v Speaker 2>sort of do the technology side of it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

223
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:17.600
<v Speaker 2>I wish more people would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If somebody else would clean the ocean,</v>

224
00:10:18.041 --> 00:10:20.200
<v Speaker 2>that'd be fine with us as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

225
00:10:20.201 --> 00:10:23.060
<v Speaker 2>but until somebody else does it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

226
00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.370
<v Speaker 2>we were kind of the ones that have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

227
00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:29.680
<v Speaker 1>That's so fascinating to me that other 7</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion people on the planet sometimes </v>

228
00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:33.941
<v Speaker 1>it really does just take one person to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to act one person,</v>

229
00:10:34.071 --> 00:10:37.700
<v Speaker 1>do something about something that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm aware of many people aware of</v>

230
00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:42.730
<v Speaker 1>many people listening have heard about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and that and it's sort of one of </v>

231
00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:45.821
<v Speaker 1>those things that's in the back of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind that doesn't affect you on a daily </v>

232
00:10:45.821 --> 00:10:45.821
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you say,</v>

233
00:10:45.821 --> 00:10:46.670
<v Speaker 1>well that's a tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a terrible thing,</v>

234
00:10:46.671 --> 00:10:50.000
<v Speaker 1>but it's not my problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have my own problems.</v>

235
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:53.820
<v Speaker 1>But you was one person decided to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about it.</v>

236
00:10:53.821 --> 00:10:58.821
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that you did when you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>16 is so fascinating to me and someone </v>

237
00:10:59.091 --> 00:11:01.790
<v Speaker 1>has to do it right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but isn't that weird?</v>

238
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:05.630
<v Speaker 1>Someone has to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody was doing shit until you came</v>

239
00:11:05.631 --> 00:11:07.820
<v Speaker 1>along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very interesting.</v>

240
00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:09.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

241
00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:14.610
<v Speaker 2>I sometimes wonder sometimes people ask </v>
<v Speaker 2>me like why,</v>

242
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.640
<v Speaker 2>why do you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like the as my answer would be like </v>

243
00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.600
<v Speaker 2>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why isn't everyone doing it?</v>

244
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:26.500
<v Speaker 1>My one thing that I was thinking was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this isn't my same feeling about </v>

245
00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.160
<v Speaker 1>pollution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>air pollution,</v>

246
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.630
<v Speaker 1>is that once they figured out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>use whatever's in the particular,</v>

247
00:11:32.631 --> 00:11:34.980
<v Speaker 1>it's an air pollution as a resource.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

248
00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:40.090
<v Speaker 1>And make it valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then people are going to be running to </v>

249
00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:42.911
<v Speaker 1>extract it out of the skies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I felt the same way about the </v>

250
00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:45.851
<v Speaker 1>Pacific garbage patch and all the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean currents where they have this </v>

251
00:11:45.851 --> 00:11:46.570
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is it?</v>

252
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:51.580
<v Speaker 1>The currents bring everything together </v>
<v Speaker 1>collectively into one area just because </v>

253
00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:52.670
<v Speaker 1>of the way the ocean moves.</v>

254
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.350
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have these sort of the,</v>

255
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:59.650
<v Speaker 2>the current at the equator and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have these boundary currents and it sort</v>

256
00:11:59.651 --> 00:12:01.720
<v Speaker 2>of acts like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

257
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.940
<v Speaker 2>like the sinking your best up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

258
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.160
<v Speaker 2>So it's sort of where all the plastic </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to go.</v>

259
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:10.360
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it possible to take that stuff,</v>

260
00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:15.450
<v Speaker 2>all of that Pacif,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those disgusting particles and use </v>

261
00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:16.450
<v Speaker 2>it for something?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

262
00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:17.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

263
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually a few examples with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a bank but not here right now.</v>

264
00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:23.620
<v Speaker 2>Grab it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to go grab it?</v>

265
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:25.260
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it a bit.</v>

266
00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:27.000
<v Speaker 2>I can describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

267
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:29.350
<v Speaker 2>It's podcasts anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

268
00:12:29.351 --> 00:12:31.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what we do is we take the plastic out</v>

269
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.760
<v Speaker 2>and we um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we recycled that,</v>

270
00:12:33.761 --> 00:12:38.520
<v Speaker 2>we've developed a process for this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we can turn it into new products,</v>

271
00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:43.530
<v Speaker 2>actually the pair of sunglasses that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>finally being able to wear after a </v>

272
00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:43.810
<v Speaker 2>dreaded northern European winter.</v>

273
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:49.790
<v Speaker 2>They were already made that out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>plastic that we took out of the Great </v>

274
00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:54.540
<v Speaker 2>Pacific garbage patch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're wearing sunglasses that are </v>

275
00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:54.540
<v Speaker 2>recycled from the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

276
00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.360
<v Speaker 2>And the idea is that we can do anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this,</v>

277
00:12:55.361 --> 00:13:00.361
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can imagine sort of the part of </v>

278
00:13:00.361 --> 00:13:03.661
<v Speaker 2>your next car or your chair or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can make that out of ocean plastic </v>

279
00:13:03.971 --> 00:13:06.760
<v Speaker 2>and what we think is that the material </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself isn't valuable enough,</v>

280
00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.720
<v Speaker 2>but it's really the story behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the fact that you can say,</v>

281
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:15.750
<v Speaker 2>well it's made out of the Great Pacific </v>
<v Speaker 2>garbage patch which we think will add </v>

282
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:19.441
<v Speaker 2>value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like the difference between a </v>

283
00:13:19.441 --> 00:13:20.620
<v Speaker 2>normal pebble and the piece of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Berlin Wall,</v>

284
00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:24.250
<v Speaker 2>it's one is worth shit and the other is </v>
<v Speaker 2>worth something.</v>

285
00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.950
<v Speaker 2>So that's what we kind of want to use as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a way to,</v>

286
00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:30.520
<v Speaker 2>to then be able to fund the operations </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the clinic.</v>

287
00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:35.850
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a fantastic idea and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that'll be a huge value for </v>

288
00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:35.850
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

289
00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:40.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people really want to buy </v>

290
00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:42.241
<v Speaker 2>something that they know is recycled out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of something that was choking fish and </v>

291
00:13:42.241 --> 00:13:42.310
<v Speaker 2>birds to death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

292
00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:46.120
<v Speaker 2>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he does his turning plastic from the</v>

293
00:13:46.121 --> 00:13:51.121
<v Speaker 2>ocean into $200 shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sports sportswear maker is teaming up </v>

294
00:13:51.121 --> 00:13:53.470
<v Speaker 2>with something to sell three new shoes </v>
<v Speaker 2>made with plastic pulled from the ocean.</v>

295
00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:54.660
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

296
00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.530
<v Speaker 2>that's awesome for the kind of stuff you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can do.</v>

297
00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.800
<v Speaker 2>So in this example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I did,</v>

298
00:13:58.801 --> 00:14:00.910
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she didn't use a plastic from the ocean.</v>

299
00:14:00.911 --> 00:14:05.911
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they just said that for </v>

300
00:14:05.911 --> 00:14:07.960
<v Speaker 2>marketing reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make that from plastic that sort </v>

301
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:08.440
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call it ocean bound.</v>

302
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:09.220
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

303
00:14:09.221 --> 00:14:11.860
<v Speaker 2>those lie motherfuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God dammit.</v>

304
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.060
<v Speaker 2>They got them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

305
00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.200
<v Speaker 2>That's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's on the way to the ocean.</v>

306
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which I guess is any,</v>

307
00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:23.770
<v Speaker 2>could be anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like we were going to throw it </v>

308
00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:23.770
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sneakers.</v>

309
00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:23.770
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

310
00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:24.590
<v Speaker 2>that's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

311
00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:29.640
<v Speaker 2>it's still catching venture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps some of those.</v>

312
00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:32.890
<v Speaker 2>Do you have some of those that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very cool.</v>

313
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.470
<v Speaker 2>I liked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked them and I liked the people that</v>

314
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.200
<v Speaker 2>work on it and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's a lie.</v>

315
00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:39.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>

316
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.120
<v Speaker 2>a white light a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

317
00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:43.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

318
00:14:43.721 --> 00:14:46.870
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I mean the composition of the plastic</v>

319
00:14:46.871 --> 00:14:48.970
<v Speaker 2>that we'll be pulling out of the ocean </v>
<v Speaker 2>is pretty unique.</v>

320
00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:53.971
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quite degraded because of the </v>

321
00:14:53.971 --> 00:14:54.540
<v Speaker 2>decades of UV light heading it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

322
00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:57.350
<v Speaker 2>so we really had to develop a new </v>
<v Speaker 2>process to do this,</v>

323
00:14:57.351 --> 00:15:02.351
<v Speaker 2>so probably maybe a year so it will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually be able to launch the first </v>

324
00:15:02.351 --> 00:15:04.700
<v Speaker 2>line of products made out of sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>real the real deal.</v>

325
00:15:04.701 --> 00:15:06.620
<v Speaker 2>The plastic actually coming out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ocean.</v>

326
00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:07.250
<v Speaker 2>That's excellent.</v>

327
00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:12.300
<v Speaker 3>So you're going to sell like raw plastic</v>
<v Speaker 3>and is there an issue of who owns the </v>

328
00:15:12.401 --> 00:15:17.401
<v Speaker 3>plastic?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean even [inaudible] is in the </v>

329
00:15:17.401 --> 00:15:17.800
<v Speaker 3>Commons of the ocean in international </v>
<v Speaker 3>waters.</v>

330
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:21.150
<v Speaker 2>I think it'd be hilarious if somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>would sort of raise their hand and say,</v>

331
00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.070
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my plastic.</v>

332
00:15:22.071 --> 00:15:27.071
<v Speaker 2>I put it in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we have another kind of legal </v>

333
00:15:27.071 --> 00:15:28.730
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if it becomes a resource like oil.</v>

334
00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

335
00:15:30.141 --> 00:15:35.141
<v Speaker 2>I think there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the salvage laws that say if a few sort </v>

336
00:15:35.141 --> 00:15:37.040
<v Speaker 2>of salvage something into the shoe </v>
<v Speaker 2>oceans,</v>

337
00:15:37.041 --> 00:15:40.850
<v Speaker 2>you can actually keep it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that doesn't appear to be a,</v>

338
00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.270
<v Speaker 2>an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

339
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:47.350
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely it will be a sort of closing </v>

340
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:47.670
<v Speaker 2>the circle and will be a fun project </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

341
00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it sounds,</v>

342
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.710
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like an amazing thing and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>guarantee people would be very,</v>

343
00:15:53.711 --> 00:15:58.711
<v Speaker 3>very interested to buy things that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>know we're made out of something that </v>

344
00:15:58.711 --> 00:16:00.230
<v Speaker 3>was really a horrible</v>

345
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:04.110
<v Speaker 2>side effect of civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

346
00:16:04.111 --> 00:16:07.080
<v Speaker 2>I think if you have the choice between a</v>
<v Speaker 2>normal.</v>

347
00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.600
<v Speaker 2>Let's use this sunglass example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

348
00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:12.180
<v Speaker 2>a normal pair or a pair of coming out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ocean.</v>

349
00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:14.370
<v Speaker 2>I think nine out of 10 people would </v>
<v Speaker 2>choose the latter.</v>

350
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:15.320
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

351
00:16:15.321 --> 00:16:17.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think it would be giant for </v>
<v Speaker 3>companies to,</v>

352
00:16:17.451 --> 00:16:22.451
<v Speaker 3>to advertise that we only use 100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent recycled from the ocean plastic </v>

353
00:16:22.451 --> 00:16:27.191
<v Speaker 3>and when exactly that would be gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now how long do you think it would be </v>

354
00:16:27.191 --> 00:16:28.160
<v Speaker 3>before this could be a reality?</v>

355
00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:31.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the first system it's currently being</v>

356
00:16:31.751 --> 00:16:36.751
<v Speaker 2>assembled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we are renting a former naval base </v>

357
00:16:36.751 --> 00:16:40.200
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the San Francisco Bay where it's </v>

358
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.620
<v Speaker 2>currently being put together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still relatively small system.</v>

359
00:16:41.621 --> 00:16:46.621
<v Speaker 2>It's 2000 feet in length.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So eventually there'll be almost a </v>

360
00:16:46.621 --> 00:16:46.720
<v Speaker 2>double the size,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is,</v>

361
00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:51.010
<v Speaker 2>this one will be launched in pretty late</v>
<v Speaker 2>June,</v>

362
00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:52.370
<v Speaker 2>early July.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

363
00:16:52.371 --> 00:16:57.371
<v Speaker 2>then we'll take it out the first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first deployment will not yet be </v>

364
00:16:57.371 --> 00:16:59.950
<v Speaker 2>directly in the patch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're just deploying it ran 300 miles</v>

365
00:16:59.951 --> 00:17:02.590
<v Speaker 2>of the coast just to make sure that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>works well.</v>

366
00:17:02.591 --> 00:17:07.591
<v Speaker 2>Sort of a final rehearsal if that goes </v>
<v Speaker 2>well then by probably around August we </v>

367
00:17:07.591 --> 00:17:12.331
<v Speaker 2>should be ready to take it all the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the patch and hopefully soon after </v>

368
00:17:12.331 --> 00:17:16.351
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>collect the first plastic and then we </v>

369
00:17:16.351 --> 00:17:18.331
<v Speaker 2>hope to have the first shipment of first</v>
<v Speaker 2>plastic back back in port before the end</v>

370
00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:25.050
<v Speaker 2>of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we think that will be such a </v>

371
00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:25.050
<v Speaker 2>symbolic moment for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for 60 years,</v>

372
00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:27.640
<v Speaker 2>man has been putting plastic into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ocean and from that moment onwards we're</v>

373
00:17:27.641 --> 00:17:28.900
<v Speaker 2>also taking it back out again.</v>

374
00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:32.490
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you feel like you can get 40 percent</v>

375
00:17:32.491 --> 00:17:34.050
<v Speaker 3>of the garbage patch in 10 years.</v>

376
00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:39.800
<v Speaker 2>It's actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So with a fleet of 60 of these cleanup </v>

377
00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.851
<v Speaker 2>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should be able to clean up half this </v>

378
00:17:42.851 --> 00:17:42.851
<v Speaker 2>great pacific garbage patch every five </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

379
00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.870
<v Speaker 2>which of course the more honorable um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

380
00:17:46.871 --> 00:17:51.871
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you could get faster if you want </v>

381
00:17:51.871 --> 00:17:51.871
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you put in more systems.</v>

382
00:17:51.871 --> 00:17:52.170
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are you guys getting funding from?</v>

383
00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:57.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so so far we've been very generously </v>

384
00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:58.470
<v Speaker 2>supported by but mostly individuals </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>

385
00:17:58.471 --> 00:18:03.471
<v Speaker 2>So uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ranging from people that just donate 50 </v>

386
00:18:03.471 --> 00:18:06.561
<v Speaker 2>bucks to two people like Marc Benioff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the founder of salesforce and couple of </v>

387
00:18:06.781 --> 00:18:09.030
<v Speaker 2>other very high net worth individuals.</v>

388
00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:10.980
<v Speaker 3>If someone wanted to donate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how would they do?</v>

389
00:18:10.981 --> 00:18:11.310
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

390
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.320
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just go to the website,</v>

391
00:18:13.321 --> 00:18:17.280
<v Speaker 2>the ocean cleanup.com</v>
<v Speaker 2>and feel free to get in touch with us.</v>

392
00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:21.160
<v Speaker 3>So mostly individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mostly wealthy philanthropists.</v>

393
00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:26.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that has gotten us to around 35 to </v>

394
00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:26.870
<v Speaker 2>$40,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>

395
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.250
<v Speaker 2>which has been enough to fund all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>years of research and development,</v>

396
00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:35.360
<v Speaker 2>the whole mapping of the patch as well </v>
<v Speaker 2>as the construction of this first system</v>

397
00:18:35.361 --> 00:18:36.140
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

398
00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that should get us to the point where</v>

399
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:40.880
<v Speaker 2>we're sort of proven technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then for the scaleup,</v>

400
00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:43.050
<v Speaker 2>the idea is that basically any company </v>
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>

401
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:48.080
<v Speaker 2>can go and fund their own system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We estimate the cost of every system to </v>

402
00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:48.840
<v Speaker 2>be around 5 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

403
00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.120
<v Speaker 2>basically you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

404
00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the system will be around a kilometer,</v>

405
00:18:52.461 --> 00:18:55.550
<v Speaker 2>that's plenty of space for logos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world is watching.</v>

406
00:18:55.551 --> 00:18:57.940
<v Speaker 2>So it's like this massive billboard </v>
<v Speaker 2>floating out there.</v>

407
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.060
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

408
00:18:59.061 --> 00:19:01.920
<v Speaker 2>so the idea is that any company can sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of fund or are individual,</v>

409
00:19:01.921 --> 00:19:02.210
<v Speaker 2>even</v>

410
00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.540
<v Speaker 3>some of the racist Nike can be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you,</v>

411
00:19:04.541 --> 00:19:06.700
<v Speaker 3>Adidas were actually doing this for </v>
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>

412
00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:08.440
<v Speaker 3>Just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adidas,</v>

413
00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:10.890
<v Speaker 3>that will be Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be hilarious.</v>

414
00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:16.320
<v Speaker 3>So what is the process in taking the </v>
<v Speaker 3>plastic from the ocean and converting </v>

415
00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.020
<v Speaker 3>into usable plastic like that you would </v>
<v Speaker 3>use in sunglasses?</v>

416
00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

417
00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:23.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing you'd do is you can have</v>

418
00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.930
<v Speaker 2>your washer do sorted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you scrub it to,</v>

419
00:19:26.931 --> 00:19:29.260
<v Speaker 2>to get you so disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very clean,</v>

420
00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:33.340
<v Speaker 2>sort of a fragments of plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

421
00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:34.490
<v Speaker 2>then we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

422
00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:39.610
<v Speaker 2>we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a process called compounding </v>

423
00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:41.320
<v Speaker 2>where you sort of remelted and add some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some additives and make it into what you</v>

424
00:19:41.321 --> 00:19:42.810
<v Speaker 2>call pellets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these are sort of these,</v>

425
00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:48.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beat sized particles which can be fed </v>

426
00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:51.631
<v Speaker 2>into any machine in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So say an Ikea machine for furniture or </v>

427
00:19:51.631 --> 00:19:53.200
<v Speaker 2>tesla machine for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for cars.</v>

428
00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

429
00:19:55.370 --> 00:20:00.370
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that process we can add to custom </v>

430
00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:03.360
<v Speaker 2>develops tailor made for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for our feedstock because it's such a </v>

431
00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:03.430
<v Speaker 2>unique composition.</v>

432
00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:08.700
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really fascinating because I think </v>

433
00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:12.061
<v Speaker 3>that that will be a hugely desirable </v>
<v Speaker 3>form of construction.</v>

434
00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:19.200
<v Speaker 3>Like if you can prove that the plastic </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you use was made and is actually,</v>

435
00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:25.440
<v Speaker 3>it's a benefit to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get that plastic and make things out </v>

436
00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:25.440
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>

437
00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:25.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>

438
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:30.750
<v Speaker 2>it's still more expensive obviously than</v>
<v Speaker 2>just normal plastic because we have to </v>

439
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:35.461
<v Speaker 2>collect it from 1200 miles off shore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but on the other hand,</v>

440
00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:41.290
<v Speaker 2>so just by selling it as plastic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that will be a good </v>

441
00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:43.000
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but making it into sort of going further</v>

442
00:20:43.001 --> 00:20:48.001
<v Speaker 2>into value chain up to the consumer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that can make sense because </v>

443
00:20:48.001 --> 00:20:48.910
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to use the sunglass example,</v>

444
00:20:48.911 --> 00:20:52.480
<v Speaker 2>it's probably around a 100 grams of </v>
<v Speaker 2>material,</v>

445
00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:57.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that would take about a maybe a </v>

446
00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:01.350
<v Speaker 2>dollar to collect and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's a dollar on the hundred and $20 </v>

447
00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:02.980
<v Speaker 2>pair of sunglasses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

448
00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:04.270
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

449
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:06.640
<v Speaker 2>so I think that really going at all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way up to,</v>

450
00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:11.641
<v Speaker 2>in the value chain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where you can really add the </v>

451
00:21:11.641 --> 00:21:11.641
<v Speaker 2>value.</v>

452
00:21:11.641 --> 00:21:11.641
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

453
00:21:11.641 --> 00:21:15.620
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that was shocking to </v>
<v Speaker 3>me when I was investigating plastic is </v>

454
00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:17.940
<v Speaker 3>that I didn't know that plastic you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>make plastic out of hemp.</v>

455
00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:21.090
<v Speaker 3>The hemp plastic is actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>biodegradable.</v>

456
00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sugar cane.</v>

457
00:21:22.671 --> 00:21:27.320
<v Speaker 2>And there's many sort of bio based types</v>
<v Speaker 2>of plastic that the thing is though,</v>

458
00:21:27.321 --> 00:21:29.060
<v Speaker 2>that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is very,</v>

459
00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:34.180
<v Speaker 2>very sort of complicated and </v>
<v Speaker 2>controversial world of sort sorted the </v>

460
00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:34.180
<v Speaker 2>bioplastics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

461
00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:38.240
<v Speaker 2>because you have something called </v>
<v Speaker 2>biobased and biodegradable,</v>

462
00:21:38.241 --> 00:21:41.660
<v Speaker 2>so you can make plastic out of say </v>
<v Speaker 2>sugarcane,</v>

463
00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:47.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is chemically exactly the same as </v>

464
00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:49.901
<v Speaker 2>plastic that it was made from crude oil </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it would take the same amount of </v>

465
00:21:50.181 --> 00:21:55.181
<v Speaker 2>time for a two degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a base doesn't necessarily mean that </v>

466
00:21:55.181 --> 00:21:57.530
<v Speaker 2>it's biodegradable and vice versa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

467
00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:03.190
<v Speaker 2>so it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very complicated world that even </v>

468
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:06.970
<v Speaker 2>sometimes her experts on this on plastic</v>
<v Speaker 2>pollution being confused about it.</v>

469
00:22:07.311 --> 00:22:09.920
<v Speaker 2>So let alone sort of the general </v>
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>

470
00:22:09.921 --> 00:22:11.530
<v Speaker 2>So uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in,</v>

471
00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:16.540
<v Speaker 2>in short,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there isn't yet sort of the holy grill </v>

472
00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:19.421
<v Speaker 2>of this type of plastic that on one hand</v>
<v Speaker 2>is very good in terms of performance in </v>

473
00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.910
<v Speaker 2>a usable life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when it,</v>

474
00:22:22.911 --> 00:22:25.210
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enter the ocean just degrades in,</v>

475
00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:27.370
<v Speaker 2>in a matter of days or months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

476
00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:29.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that would be,</v>

477
00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there will be a great innovation.</v>

478
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:36.350
<v Speaker 3>Is the quality of biodegradable plastic </v>
<v Speaker 3>inferior to bio based but non </v>

479
00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:37.530
<v Speaker 3>biodegradable.</v>

480
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or it's.</v>

481
00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:43.670
<v Speaker 2>And it's mostly limited in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>applications so you can really get </v>

482
00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:43.670
<v Speaker 2>everything</v>

483
00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:48.690
<v Speaker 3>like the actual physical plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it feel different to the touch </v>

484
00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:48.690
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you?</v>

485
00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:49.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

486
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:53.570
<v Speaker 2>it usually makes more noise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more sort of crumbly,</v>

487
00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:56.230
<v Speaker 3>so it's brittle or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

488
00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:57.850
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that makes sense.</v>

489
00:22:57.851 --> 00:22:58.840
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously it's going to.</v>

490
00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:01.840
<v Speaker 3>So if you're going to make water bottles</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of biodegradable plastic,</v>

491
00:23:01.841 --> 00:23:02.530
<v Speaker 3>they're probably going to leak.</v>

492
00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:03.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

493
00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.030
<v Speaker 2>That's yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

494
00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.280
<v Speaker 2>That's not possible yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're compostable.</v>

495
00:23:08.281 --> 00:23:10.710
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have compostable plastic,</v>

496
00:23:10.711 --> 00:23:13.980
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you can use for water bottles,</v>

497
00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:19.100
<v Speaker 2>but then the only way for it to degrade </v>
<v Speaker 2>who'd be to be in sort of this </v>

498
00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.640
<v Speaker 2>industrial composter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a temperature of 100 degrees and</v>

499
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:25.590
<v Speaker 2>pressure and things like that and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>would integrate in the ocean.</v>

500
00:23:25.591 --> 00:23:28.980
<v Speaker 2>So it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very complicated area.</v>

501
00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:34.970
<v Speaker 3>Third had Paul stamets on who's in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>colleges and he was talking about all </v>

502
00:23:35.861 --> 00:23:40.861
<v Speaker 3>the different fungus that could be </v>
<v Speaker 3>potentially engineered to eat plastic.</v>

503
00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.830
<v Speaker 3>This is another thing that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>working on.</v>

504
00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:45.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

505
00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:45.990
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

506
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:49.620
<v Speaker 3>of course it would be great to have on </v>
<v Speaker 3>landfills and things like sheets.</v>

507
00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:55.060
<v Speaker 3>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a process that we're also </v>

508
00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:55.580
<v Speaker 3>investigating for our recycling because </v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing you could do is you could take</v>

509
00:23:55.581 --> 00:23:59.530
<v Speaker 3>that plastic and then using either </v>
<v Speaker 3>enzymes or indeed fung,</v>

510
00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:02.690
<v Speaker 3>fung guy and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could turn it back into biomass.</v>

511
00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:07.470
<v Speaker 3>So from that biomass you could make </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything else against it.</v>

512
00:24:07.471 --> 00:24:09.980
<v Speaker 3>You could make a bio based plastic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example.</v>

513
00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:13.470
<v Speaker 3>So does this change your relationship </v>
<v Speaker 3>with plastic?</v>

514
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:18.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you sit there and you're drinking </v>

515
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:20.121
<v Speaker 3>out of this plastic bottle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think I'm going to have to clean </v>

516
00:24:20.121 --> 00:24:20.121
<v Speaker 3>this fucking thing up someday?</v>

517
00:24:20.121 --> 00:24:21.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

518
00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:26.870
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but on the Ariana and also not against </v>

519
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:28.840
<v Speaker 2>plastic because I realized that without </v>
<v Speaker 2>plastic,</v>

520
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:32.380
<v Speaker 2>say modern medicine will be very </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult.</v>

521
00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:38.070
<v Speaker 2>That plastic lot more food waste would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be produced and without plastic we </v>

522
00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:42.751
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be able to clean the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big Ocean actually a lot of the </v>

523
00:24:42.751 --> 00:24:42.751
<v Speaker 2>components of our cleanup system </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>

524
00:24:42.751 --> 00:24:45.040
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we can pull up an image of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing being built right now.</v>

525
00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's actually a lot of the parts of</v>

526
00:24:49.001 --> 00:24:51.810
<v Speaker 2>that are made out of plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

527
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

528
00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:55.610
<v Speaker 2>so it's kind of ironic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's poetic embolism.</v>

529
00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here it is very far.</v>

530
00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.530
<v Speaker 2>Solving fire with fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>

531
00:25:02.531 --> 00:25:06.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we can live without </v>
<v Speaker 2>plastic and I don't think we should want</v>

532
00:25:06.701 --> 00:25:11.701
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really just about managing </v>

533
00:25:11.701 --> 00:25:12.130
<v Speaker 2>the material in a way that it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>end up in the ocean,</v>

534
00:25:12.131 --> 00:25:17.131
<v Speaker 2>which means that it ed comes back to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>material being valuable enough at the </v>

535
00:25:17.131 --> 00:25:21.810
<v Speaker 2>end of life because if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's cheaper to recycle than to not </v>

536
00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:24.010
<v Speaker 2>recycle will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then obviously it would happen and there</v>

537
00:25:24.011 --> 00:25:25.660
<v Speaker 2>needs to be good infrastructure for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

538
00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:30.700
<v Speaker 2>And then I think as a final,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a final safety net,</v>

539
00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:35.760
<v Speaker 2>we need technologies like this to sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of intercepted in river mouths as well </v>

540
00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.740
<v Speaker 2>as sort of clean up the legacy of the 60</v>
<v Speaker 2>years that we're having in the middle of</v>

541
00:25:38.741 --> 00:25:43.741
<v Speaker 2>the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think we can live with that </v>

542
00:25:43.741 --> 00:25:43.741
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

543
00:25:43.741 --> 00:25:43.741
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

544
00:25:43.741 --> 00:25:43.741
<v Speaker 3>Either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not yet.</v>

545
00:25:43.741 --> 00:25:48.200
<v Speaker 3>And are when you're looking at the water</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you see the plastic that is in this </v>

546
00:25:48.321 --> 00:25:50.870
<v Speaker 3>Pacific garbage patch on the other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other four patches,</v>

547
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:53.810
<v Speaker 3>how deep does that plastic go from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>surface?</v>

548
00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:59.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so for most of the plastic really stays </v>

549
00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:00.080
<v Speaker 2>on our near the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've,</v>

550
00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:02.990
<v Speaker 2>we've done expedition student for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>too to measure it.</v>

551
00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:08.210
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually why our system only </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes three meters deep because that's so</v>

552
00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:11.000
<v Speaker 2>below that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's virtually no plastic anymore.</v>

553
00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.780
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was only about nine feet.</v>

554
00:26:12.781 --> 00:26:14.780
<v Speaker 3>So when your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when your trunk,</v>

555
00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:17.520
<v Speaker 3>when you see the little tiny itty bitty </v>
<v Speaker 3>pieces,</v>

556
00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.210
<v Speaker 3>it seems like as the plastic breaks down</v>
<v Speaker 3>over decades,</v>

557
00:26:21.211 --> 00:26:25.860
<v Speaker 3>it becomes like almost like a gelatinous</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of chunky thing.</v>

558
00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:30.840
<v Speaker 2>It's called microplastics are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've sort of these particles that look</v>

559
00:26:30.841 --> 00:26:32.580
<v Speaker 2>a bit almost like grains of sand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

560
00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:34.940
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are sort of really small.</v>

561
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:39.950
<v Speaker 2>Even those we measured our primarily in </v>
<v Speaker 2>those top three meters or nine feet in.</v>

562
00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:41.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

563
00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:44.310
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and another surprising finding,</v>

564
00:26:44.311 --> 00:26:46.020
<v Speaker 2>I think from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from those explanations,</v>

565
00:26:46.021 --> 00:26:51.021
<v Speaker 2>was that still more than 99 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the plastic is larger than a millimeter.</v>

566
00:26:52.411 --> 00:26:55.200
<v Speaker 2>So larger than those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those very tiny pieces,</v>

567
00:26:55.560 --> 00:27:00.560
<v Speaker 2>which means that on one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's good news because that </v>

568
00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:04.731
<v Speaker 2>means it's not too late because </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously the smaller to get the more </v>

569
00:27:04.731 --> 00:27:06.270
<v Speaker 2>harmful they get a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they end up in the food chain,</v>

570
00:27:06.271 --> 00:27:08.270
<v Speaker 2>but they also are harder to clean up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

571
00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:09.300
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

572
00:27:09.301 --> 00:27:10.890
<v Speaker 2>so it's 100,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not too late.</v>

573
00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.960
<v Speaker 2>So it's the good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the good news I think,</v>

574
00:27:12.961 --> 00:27:17.961
<v Speaker 2>but on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also means that there's still 99 </v>

575
00:27:17.961 --> 00:27:19.590
<v Speaker 2>percent of a plastic out there that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

576
00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:24.800
<v Speaker 2>over the next few decades will become </v>
<v Speaker 2>microplastics as well if we don't clean </v>

577
00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:29.481
<v Speaker 2>it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's sort of this ticking time </v>

578
00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:29.481
<v Speaker 2>bomb out there that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

579
00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:33.730
<v Speaker 2>if we just leave it there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of microplastics could </v>

580
00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:36.231
<v Speaker 2>increase over a hundred fold over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>next few decades and then we will be in </v>

581
00:27:36.231 --> 00:27:36.231
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

582
00:27:36.231 --> 00:27:36.290
<v Speaker 2>in March,</v>

583
00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:42.120
<v Speaker 1>worse situation than we are today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So have marine biologists done studies </v>

584
00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:46.830
<v Speaker 1>on the impact in that particular area in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of populations of fish and marine </v>

585
00:27:47.021 --> 00:27:47.410
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>

586
00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:48.340
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

587
00:27:48.341 --> 00:27:53.341
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's many species that are being </v>

588
00:27:53.341 --> 00:27:55.940
<v Speaker 2>affected on one side due to ingestion on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

589
00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:00.450
<v Speaker 2>on the other side through entanglement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So actually another finding of our study</v>

590
00:28:00.451 --> 00:28:05.451
<v Speaker 2>was that almost half of the plastic by </v>
<v Speaker 2>mass is things like ropes and fishing </v>

591
00:28:05.911 --> 00:28:08.430
<v Speaker 2>nets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which of course disastrous.</v>

592
00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:10.560
<v Speaker 2>Well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four propellers for,</v>

593
00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:11.500
<v Speaker 2>for boats that go out.</v>

594
00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>photo indeed.</v>

595
00:28:14.111 --> 00:28:16.130
<v Speaker 1>So arena,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible photo of a,</v>

596
00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:21.330
<v Speaker 1>a turtle that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it looks like it's caught in a </v>

597
00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:24.961
<v Speaker 1>bush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just this massive net that this </v>

598
00:28:24.961 --> 00:28:25.870
<v Speaker 1>thing is swimming around with this thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>attached to his body.</v>

599
00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:31.170
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to ask you about is cleaning up </v>

600
00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:34.351
<v Speaker 1>the nets because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had talked to someone who was </v>

601
00:28:34.351 --> 00:28:37.800
<v Speaker 1>explaining that every time they fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times they'll cut the nets </v>

602
00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:38.410
<v Speaker 1>lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

603
00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:44.280
<v Speaker 2>So it's probably a combination of </v>
<v Speaker 2>accidental loss and intentional lots.</v>

604
00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:50.010
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this amount of net really was </v>

605
00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:50.380
<v Speaker 2>quite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite staggering.</v>

606
00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:55.400
<v Speaker 1>And did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you remember who was bringing that </v>

607
00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:55.400
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>

608
00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.220
<v Speaker 1>Somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody brought that up that they just </v>

609
00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:00.680
<v Speaker 1>released the nets and that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>commonplace and it was stunning because </v>

610
00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:00.680
<v Speaker 1>we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

611
00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Every time they do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

612
00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:07.360
<v Speaker 1>the netscape cut in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get damaged so they just cut the </v>

613
00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.050
<v Speaker 1>nets loose and the nets are plastic too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

614
00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:10.810
<v Speaker 1>But that's insane that that's legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they do that,</v>

615
00:29:10.811 --> 00:29:12.020
<v Speaker 1>that they don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

616
00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:13.800
<v Speaker 1>It's not Lego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not really legal.</v>

617
00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.860
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're lost for this.</v>

618
00:29:16.861 --> 00:29:19.450
<v Speaker 1>But obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know that people do that?</v>

619
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:22.440
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to monitor the middle of the ocean.</v>

620
00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:27.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I guess you should probably have </v>

621
00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:27.530
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a gps tracking on your net.</v>

622
00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:29.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that could be one thing.</v>

623
00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:34.690
<v Speaker 2>Or You could think about a need market </v>
<v Speaker 2>based solutions where there will be a </v>

624
00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:36.560
<v Speaker 2>financial incentive if they bring their </v>
<v Speaker 2>nets.</v>

625
00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:37.050
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

626
00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:42.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some sort of a penalization if they </v>

627
00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:42.340
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this Jamie?</v>

628
00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:45.400
<v Speaker 1>The impact and abandoned ocean fishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>nets on marine life.</v>

629
00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.140
<v Speaker 1>Chris Ryan or Duncan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

630
00:29:47.141 --> 00:29:48.460
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

631
00:29:48.461 --> 00:29:50.980
<v Speaker 1>Google says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

632
00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:56.080
<v Speaker 1>that is just so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so sad that it's such a wasteful,</v>

633
00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:02.280
<v Speaker 1>dismissive sort of thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just cut it loose and it's gone.</v>

634
00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.180
<v Speaker 1>It's in the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No worries.</v>

635
00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:06.040
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

636
00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:08.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's a very obvious kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>impact.</v>

637
00:30:08.451 --> 00:30:12.290
<v Speaker 2>And then another thing that was also a </v>
<v Speaker 2>study done recently,</v>

638
00:30:12.291 --> 00:30:17.291
<v Speaker 2>so we looked at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the concentrations of plastic versus </v>

639
00:30:17.291 --> 00:30:19.790
<v Speaker 2>naturally occurring the marine life in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this garbage patch.</v>

640
00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:24.820
<v Speaker 2>And then what we saw was that there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>180 times more plastic at the surface.</v>

641
00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:29.930
<v Speaker 2>Then sort of natural food for birds and </v>
<v Speaker 2>turtles and things like that.</v>

642
00:30:29.931 --> 00:30:34.310
<v Speaker 2>So you can imagine if you are a turtle </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the surface of this garbage patch and</v>

643
00:30:34.311 --> 00:30:39.311
<v Speaker 2>you sort of take a bite to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's 180 times larger chance that you</v>

644
00:30:39.501 --> 00:30:41.930
<v Speaker 2>eat plastic rather than a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 2>plankton.</v>

645
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.230
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

646
00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:48.300
<v Speaker 2>and what we found was that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentration is so high that it </v>

647
00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:48.830
<v Speaker 2>connection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have this chemical impact,</v>

648
00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where um,</v>

649
00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:55.860
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where these chemicals have a potential </v>

650
00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:55.970
<v Speaker 2>health impact on these organisms as well</v>
<v Speaker 2>as um,</v>

651
00:30:56.190 --> 00:31:00.440
<v Speaker 2>a species further up the food food web,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including US humans.</v>

652
00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:05.750
<v Speaker 1>So have we noticed that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have people been tested and shown to </v>

653
00:31:06.511 --> 00:31:11.511
<v Speaker 1>have ingested plastic that they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten through eating tuna or something </v>

654
00:31:11.511 --> 00:31:11.550
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

655
00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:14.920
<v Speaker 2>So the plastic itself isn't the thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that chemicals,</v>

656
00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:17.860
<v Speaker 2>chemicals that are attached to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>plastic.</v>

657
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:22.180
<v Speaker 2>And for example you see is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

658
00:31:22.181 --> 00:31:27.181
<v Speaker 2>in Greenland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the native communities that really </v>

659
00:31:27.181 --> 00:31:28.360
<v Speaker 2>rely on fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have much higher cancer rates.</v>

660
00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:32.950
<v Speaker 2>They have a much higher concentrations </v>
<v Speaker 2>of mercury,</v>

661
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:36.970
<v Speaker 2>other heavy metals as well as these </v>
<v Speaker 2>persistent organic pollutants.</v>

662
00:31:36.971 --> 00:31:40.300
<v Speaker 2>He thinks that attached to the press,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the plastic in Greenland.</v>

663
00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:41.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

664
00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:46.560
<v Speaker 2>like these sort of these native </v>
<v Speaker 2>communities that rely on fish and other </v>

665
00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:46.900
<v Speaker 2>sea life</v>

666
00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:52.300
<v Speaker 1>there to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a recent trend that they have </v>

667
00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:52.300
<v Speaker 1>higher rates of cancer.</v>

668
00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:52.300
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

669
00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:56.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how recent it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the past few decades I can imagine.</v>

670
00:31:56.661 --> 00:31:59.270
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really linked to their,</v>

671
00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:00.850
<v Speaker 2>their marine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

672
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:04.880
<v Speaker 2>the consumption of marine sources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

673
00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:06.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously it's hard to say well how many</v>

674
00:32:06.891 --> 00:32:09.470
<v Speaker 2>percent of that is just heavy metals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

675
00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:12.710
<v Speaker 2>For as far as what's coming by plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But sure,</v>

676
00:32:12.711 --> 00:32:14.020
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

677
00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:19.260
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the kind of chemicals and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at the lab tests that they've </v>

678
00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:19.520
<v Speaker 2>done with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those chemicals.</v>

679
00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:21.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are not very good for you.</v>

680
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:26.830
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that if you leave a water </v>

681
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:26.830
<v Speaker 1>bottle like this in your car and it gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>hot out,</v>

682
00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:31.250
<v Speaker 1>that the water will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a plastic will leach into the water.</v>

683
00:32:31.251 --> 00:32:31.820
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

684
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:37.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it depends on the kind of </v>

685
00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:37.070
<v Speaker 2>plastic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have,</v>

686
00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:40.960
<v Speaker 2>I think with this prayer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the liner would contain salads and </v>

687
00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:41.690
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

688
00:32:41.691 --> 00:32:42.680
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

689
00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.120
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

690
00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.180
<v Speaker 2>so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

691
00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:46.680
<v Speaker 2>when you look at this chemicals you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

692
00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:49.760
<v Speaker 2>you have two kinds of things you should </v>
<v Speaker 2>I think worry about.</v>

693
00:32:49.761 --> 00:32:54.761
<v Speaker 2>One is the chemicals that are actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the plastic and secondly there's </v>

694
00:32:54.761 --> 00:32:58.270
<v Speaker 2>these chemicals that just float around </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the ocean and then can attach to the </v>

695
00:32:58.270 --> 00:32:58.870
<v Speaker 2>plastic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

696
00:32:58.940 --> 00:32:59.930
<v Speaker 2>when they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

697
00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:02.780
<v Speaker 2>because they sort of act like this </v>
<v Speaker 2>chemical sponge,</v>

698
00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:06.050
<v Speaker 2>the plastic wants to repel water and </v>
<v Speaker 2>those chemicals too.</v>

699
00:33:06.051 --> 00:33:08.270
<v Speaker 2>So they kind of act like a magnet </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards each other.</v>

700
00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:13.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and especially the latter one is well </v>

701
00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:13.690
<v Speaker 2>studied and we see that a lot on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>

702
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:14.810
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the plastic.</v>

703
00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:15.880
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

704
00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:17.360
<v Speaker 2>the former one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

705
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:20.510
<v Speaker 2>it's even an issue here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If in your car,</v>

706
00:33:20.511 --> 00:33:22.640
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an issue in your car,</v>

707
00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:23.720
<v Speaker 2>like also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

708
00:33:23.721 --> 00:33:25.680
<v Speaker 2>Well if you leave it like in a hot car </v>
<v Speaker 2>and.</v>

709
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:26.090
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

710
00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:26.300
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

711
00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:31.590
<v Speaker 3>Now the question was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is even if you're scooping out all that </v>

712
00:33:31.811 --> 00:33:36.811
<v Speaker 3>plastic out of the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it still leaving chemicals that will,</v>

713
00:33:37.451 --> 00:33:38.530
<v Speaker 3>will never be able to get up?</v>

714
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:42.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think the chemicals mostly actually</v>

715
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:47.310
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it collects more chemicals than it sort </v>

716
00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:47.310
<v Speaker 2>of leaches out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

717
00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:47.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of those,</v>

718
00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:52.940
<v Speaker 2>those sort of legacy chemicals like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pcbs and ddt sort of things that we </v>

719
00:33:54.391 --> 00:33:59.391
<v Speaker 2>use for a insulators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm a pesticide spec in the maybe </v>

720
00:34:00.601 --> 00:34:04.170
<v Speaker 2>the forties to sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these,</v>

721
00:34:04.171 --> 00:34:06.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these actually,</v>

722
00:34:06.371 --> 00:34:06.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

723
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.010
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the plastic attracts those chemicals.</v>

724
00:34:09.011 --> 00:34:10.030
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

725
00:34:10.031 --> 00:34:15.031
<v Speaker 2>in a way you kind of also remove a bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>of those chemicals and we actually have </v>

726
00:34:15.031 --> 00:34:18.301
<v Speaker 2>to wash them out before we do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>recycling because you don't want those </v>

727
00:34:18.301 --> 00:34:18.301
<v Speaker 2>in your,</v>

728
00:34:18.301 --> 00:34:22.060
<v Speaker 3>your products.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's actually some sort of a </v>

729
00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:22.060
<v Speaker 3>benefit to having those plastics in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>water.</v>

730
00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:26.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that you would encourage people to </v>

731
00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:26.200
<v Speaker 3>put in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there is some,</v>

732
00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:26.690
<v Speaker 3>some natural benefit.</v>

733
00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:27.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

734
00:34:27.691 --> 00:34:29.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

735
00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:34.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cannot really say how many percent of </v>

736
00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:36.750
<v Speaker 2>those legacy chemicals we would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>pulling out with the plastic,</v>

737
00:34:36.751 --> 00:34:38.370
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you could say,</v>

738
00:34:38.371 --> 00:34:41.820
<v Speaker 2>you could argue it's sort of an added </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit to removing it.</v>

739
00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:43.270
<v Speaker 2>Not sure having plastic in here</v>

740
00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:49.050
<v Speaker 3>now have you extended this line of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking to some of the other problems </v>

741
00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:50.260
<v Speaker 3>in the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like these heavy metals?</v>

742
00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:52.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

743
00:34:52.061 --> 00:34:56.920
<v Speaker 2>so I really hope is that the cleanup can</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of become a symbol of how we should</v>

744
00:34:56.921 --> 00:35:01.900
<v Speaker 2>use or how we should use technology to </v>
<v Speaker 2>solve problems of our time.</v>

745
00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:04.680
<v Speaker 2>So when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

746
00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:09.750
<v Speaker 2>and I think a lot of it comes down to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we shouldn't sort of protest what </v>

747
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:12.730
<v Speaker 2>we shouldn't agree with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we should build the things we should</v>

748
00:35:12.731 --> 00:35:14.900
<v Speaker 2>build a future that we do agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

749
00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:20.160
<v Speaker 2>so when you look at the past few hundred</v>
<v Speaker 2>years of modernity in our civilization,</v>

750
00:35:23.141 --> 00:35:27.580
<v Speaker 2>what we see is dramatic positive trends </v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of health,</v>

751
00:35:27.581 --> 00:35:29.440
<v Speaker 2>wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>education,</v>

752
00:35:29.441 --> 00:35:31.430
<v Speaker 2>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we had steven pinker on your show,</v>

753
00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:32.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

754
00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:37.060
<v Speaker 2>so I think that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really positive trends.</v>

755
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:42.200
<v Speaker 2>We've done a good job in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that all comes down to our ability </v>

756
00:35:42.781 --> 00:35:45.750
<v Speaker 2>to sort of imagine things that don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>exist yet.</v>

757
00:35:45.751 --> 00:35:49.950
<v Speaker 2>So it was sort of technology and </v>
<v Speaker 2>innovation and being able to work,</v>

758
00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:52.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>work together in an effective way,</v>

759
00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:55.120
<v Speaker 2>which is think about the corporation.</v>

760
00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:56.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

761
00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:58.890
<v Speaker 2>so I think those have been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

762
00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:04.090
<v Speaker 2>sort of very good trends and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>what we should do is we should also </v>

763
00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:07.701
<v Speaker 2>think about how to apply those to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>area outside of our own species and to </v>

764
00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:14.280
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the environment because when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at all those positive trends </v>

765
00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:14.790
<v Speaker 2>over the past few hundred years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

766
00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:16.890
<v Speaker 2>and then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all good.</v>

767
00:36:16.891 --> 00:36:20.760
<v Speaker 2>But there's one very big exception which</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the impact to the environment.</v>

768
00:36:20.761 --> 00:36:25.761
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like we've had all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>success at the cost of the environment </v>

769
00:36:25.761 --> 00:36:28.500
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that instead of there's some</v>

770
00:36:28.501 --> 00:36:32.370
<v Speaker 2>people that have sort of a more </v>
<v Speaker 2>reactionary field to this and they say,</v>

771
00:36:32.371 --> 00:36:35.970
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at all these problems.</v>

772
00:36:35.971 --> 00:36:39.180
<v Speaker 2>It was created by businesses and by </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>

773
00:36:39.181 --> 00:36:42.030
<v Speaker 2>So we should stay as far away from those</v>
<v Speaker 2>things as possible.</v>

774
00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:44.300
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

775
00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:46.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of stupid.</v>

776
00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:51.530
<v Speaker 2>I think that it really just shows that </v>
<v Speaker 2>these are very powerful ways of getting </v>

777
00:36:52.711 --> 00:36:57.711
<v Speaker 2>things done and I think a much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>effective way was to sort of apply that </v>

778
00:36:57.711 --> 00:37:02.210
<v Speaker 2>what has worked in other areas and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>also apply that to the area of the </v>

779
00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:02.210
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

780
00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:03.390
<v Speaker 2>so I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

781
00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:04.500
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

782
00:37:04.501 --> 00:37:09.501
<v Speaker 2>think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the car problem is not going to be </v>

783
00:37:09.501 --> 00:37:09.501
<v Speaker 2>solved by bending cars I think is going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be sold,</v>

784
00:37:09.501 --> 00:37:11.570
<v Speaker 2>but electric cars and I don't think the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

785
00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:15.180
<v Speaker 2>the pollution problem is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>solved by everyone becoming Vegan.</v>

786
00:37:15.181 --> 00:37:20.181
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going to be solved by </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like lab grown meat and other </v>

787
00:37:20.181 --> 00:37:21.320
<v Speaker 2>kinds of alternatives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

788
00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.730
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why I also think that,</v>

789
00:37:23.731 --> 00:37:24.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

790
00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:29.570
<v Speaker 2>the ocean cleanup or the plastic </v>
<v Speaker 2>pollution problem is not going to be </v>

791
00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:32.250
<v Speaker 2>solved by sort of people trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own little bits.</v>

792
00:37:32.251 --> 00:37:37.251
<v Speaker 2>And I'm trying to live without plastic </v>
<v Speaker 2>or things like that I think is going to </v>

793
00:37:37.251 --> 00:37:38.230
<v Speaker 2>be solved by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

794
00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:42.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like plastics that do not harm to</v>

795
00:37:42.061 --> 00:37:47.061
<v Speaker 2>the environment as well as technologies </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the ocean cleanup to sort of clean </v>

796
00:37:47.061 --> 00:37:47.610
<v Speaker 2>up after itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

797
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:48.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

798
00:37:48.871 --> 00:37:52.800
<v Speaker 2>and I hope that there can be a sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>symbol of that approach.</v>

799
00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:55.110
<v Speaker 3>I like what you just said there because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

800
00:37:55.130 --> 00:38:00.130
<v Speaker 3>I've always thought that technology will</v>
<v Speaker 3>most likely sort out most of these </v>

801
00:38:01.211 --> 00:38:06.211
<v Speaker 3>issues if we apply enough attention to </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and that one of the real issues is </v>

802
00:38:06.851 --> 00:38:08.890
<v Speaker 3>when someone creates some sort of a new </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology,</v>

803
00:38:08.891 --> 00:38:13.891
<v Speaker 3>they really don't have the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 3>see 50 years down the line what's going </v>

804
00:38:13.961 --> 00:38:16.840
<v Speaker 3>to happen with the side effects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the residual effects.</v>

805
00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:19.720
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's a big part of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened with plastic.</v>

806
00:38:19.721 --> 00:38:21.720
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think the solution is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

807
00:38:21.721 --> 00:38:24.430
<v Speaker 3>making an accent of a piece of rock and </v>
<v Speaker 3>living in the woods.</v>

808
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:29.870
<v Speaker 3>I think that the solution is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a long term comprehensive approach </v>

809
00:38:31.691 --> 00:38:36.691
<v Speaker 3>to how we use various technologies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>also various resources so that we don't </v>

810
00:38:37.181 --> 00:38:42.010
<v Speaker 3>have another pacific garbage patch and </v>
<v Speaker 3>some new technology 5,100,</v>

811
00:38:42.011 --> 00:38:47.011
<v Speaker 3>200 years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you went to the ocean 200 </v>

812
00:38:47.011 --> 00:38:47.011
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd see none of this.</v>

813
00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:48.640
<v Speaker 3>So this is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

814
00:38:48.641 --> 00:38:52.390
<v Speaker 3>very recent issue that's compounding at </v>
<v Speaker 3>a staggering rate.</v>

815
00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:53.970
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

816
00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:57.500
<v Speaker 2>I agree with what you say there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

817
00:38:58.840 --> 00:38:59.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

818
00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.090
<v Speaker 2>it's really just about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

819
00:39:01.091 --> 00:39:06.091
<v Speaker 2>so I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's other people that think </v>

820
00:39:06.091 --> 00:39:07.830
<v Speaker 2>that technology is inherently neutral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not good or bad,</v>

821
00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:11.240
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you compare,</v>

822
00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:16.640
<v Speaker 2>I know some bio terrorist weapon which </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could event or you could invent a </v>

823
00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:20.841
<v Speaker 2>machine to clean the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say I would argue those are not </v>

824
00:39:20.841 --> 00:39:22.590
<v Speaker 2>equally a good things to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to develop.</v>

825
00:39:22.591 --> 00:39:27.591
<v Speaker 2>So when technology isn't a inheriting </v>
<v Speaker 2>neutral means it's sort of </v>

826
00:39:27.591 --> 00:39:32.121
<v Speaker 2>deterministic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the inventor kind of puts a certain </v>

827
00:39:32.121 --> 00:39:36.230
<v Speaker 2>direction in the product already and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that can be used in our advantage </v>

828
00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:41.151
<v Speaker 2>or to phrase it differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there is a responsibility at </v>

829
00:39:41.151 --> 00:39:45.380
<v Speaker 2>with inventors and entrepreneurs to </v>
<v Speaker 2>build things that are more good than bad</v>

830
00:39:46.561 --> 00:39:51.561
<v Speaker 2>and actually plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would still argue that plastic is a </v>

831
00:39:51.561 --> 00:39:53.610
<v Speaker 2>net positive technology and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>invented as a solution.</v>

832
00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:56.010
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it saves a lot of weights,</v>

833
00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:59.910
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people got hurt when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people use glass bottles and things</v>

834
00:39:59.911 --> 00:40:04.911
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So back in the day this was invented as </v>

835
00:40:04.911 --> 00:40:05.220
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a solution,</v>

836
00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:10.430
<v Speaker 2>but it has this negative side effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I think we should now think </v>

837
00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:10.430
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

838
00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:13.230
<v Speaker 2>what technologies can we develop to </v>
<v Speaker 2>manage that negative side effect?</v>

839
00:40:13.231 --> 00:40:16.890
<v Speaker 2>And probably those have again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a small negative side effect,</v>

840
00:40:16.891 --> 00:40:21.690
<v Speaker 2>but you can think about it like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>compounding sort of staircase of,</v>

841
00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:23.840
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of net positive technologies.</v>

842
00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:27.050
<v Speaker 2>I think eventually that's how we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually solve this problem.</v>

843
00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:31.600
<v Speaker 3>So in this country there's a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of recycling,</v>

844
00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:33.700
<v Speaker 3>but how effective is that recycling?</v>

845
00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:39.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the amount of recycling is </v>

846
00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:41.821
<v Speaker 2>actually pretty low in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the US compared to other countries </v>

847
00:40:41.821 --> 00:40:43.480
<v Speaker 2>that can do everything better over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

848
00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:47.380
<v Speaker 2>I've noticed that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What countries the best at it,</v>

849
00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:53.210
<v Speaker 2>I think like Germany or Switzerland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this kind of country that really </v>

850
00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:53.500
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what do they do differently?</v>

851
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:56.650
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just think they just put more money</v>

852
00:40:56.651 --> 00:41:01.300
<v Speaker 2>in it and I think most of the waste and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the US is actually being landfilled.</v>

853
00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:07.250
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what's used to be recycled actually </v>

854
00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:10.210
<v Speaker 2>was sent to China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now like I think this year or last </v>

855
00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:10.210
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>China said,</v>

856
00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:10.210
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

857
00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:11.920
<v Speaker 2>we don't want your waste anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

858
00:41:11.921 --> 00:41:16.921
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now I think there will be a lot of </v>

859
00:41:16.921 --> 00:41:16.921
<v Speaker 2>investments in new recycling facilities </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the US.</v>

860
00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:22.100
<v Speaker 3>Now how does that get recycled save?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You use this water bottle and you empty </v>

861
00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:24.090
<v Speaker 3>and then you throw it into the recycle </v>
<v Speaker 3>container.</v>

862
00:41:24.091 --> 00:41:24.780
<v Speaker 3>What happens?</v>

863
00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

864
00:41:28.021 --> 00:41:30.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean very much depends on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>location,</v>

865
00:41:30.681 --> 00:41:33.410
<v Speaker 2>but I'm to just use an example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

866
00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:35.870
<v Speaker 2>of where I live in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back in Holland.</v>

867
00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:37.430
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they,</v>

868
00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:38.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

869
00:41:38.361 --> 00:41:41.120
<v Speaker 2>you actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they collect the plastic separately.</v>

870
00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:46.430
<v Speaker 2>Then it goes to a facility where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort the different kinds of plastic,</v>

871
00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:49.520
<v Speaker 2>they get out all the contaminants and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

872
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:53.940
<v Speaker 2>make that into two new pellets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the problem there is really the,</v>

873
00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:58.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lack of demand for recycled plastic </v>

874
00:41:58.960 --> 00:41:59.390
<v Speaker 2>because I think a lot of companies that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

875
00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:02.090
<v Speaker 2>that build products because basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>virgin,</v>

876
00:42:02.091 --> 00:42:07.091
<v Speaker 2>so new plastic is so cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd rather just do what they're used </v>

877
00:42:07.161 --> 00:42:12.161
<v Speaker 2>to and I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to see any risks with </v>

878
00:42:12.161 --> 00:42:14.630
<v Speaker 2>their materials.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they just choose for the safe option,</v>

879
00:42:14.631 --> 00:42:16.600
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new kinds of plastics.</v>

880
00:42:16.601 --> 00:42:19.970
<v Speaker 2>So I think if you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to promote recycling,</v>

881
00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:25.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would actually say well promotes the </v>

882
00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:27.910
<v Speaker 2>use of recycled material because as long</v>
<v Speaker 2>as there's a demand then the price will </v>

883
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:31.250
<v Speaker 2>go up and then automatically more </v>
<v Speaker 2>recycling what would happen.</v>

884
00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:36.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's very little demand for recycled </v>

885
00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:36.510
<v Speaker 3>plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

886
00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:36.820
<v Speaker 3>it's not something that you hear about </v>
<v Speaker 3>on a regular basis.</v>

887
00:42:36.821 --> 00:42:39.910
<v Speaker 3>Like people that are clamoring to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>only recycled plastic.</v>

888
00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:41.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that,</v>

889
00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:42.560
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

890
00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:48.010
<v Speaker 2>that could be another nice side effect </v>
<v Speaker 2>of what we do because we can kind of </v>

891
00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:51.020
<v Speaker 2>make this sort of recycled plastic a bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>more sexy.</v>

892
00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:54.260
<v Speaker 2>Perfect word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

893
00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:56.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's exactly what it is.</v>

894
00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:01.320
<v Speaker 3>Have you extended this line of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>to other environmental concerns like </v>

895
00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:06.900
<v Speaker 3>pollution in terms of chemical spills </v>
<v Speaker 3>and pollution in the air and things </v>

896
00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:07.510
<v Speaker 3>along those lines?</v>

897
00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:13.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have quite a few more ideas I would </v>

898
00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:14.650
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

899
00:43:14.651 --> 00:43:19.651
<v Speaker 2>I would really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really wouldn't be good for the ocean </v>

900
00:43:19.651 --> 00:43:19.651
<v Speaker 2>cleanup if I would get distracted.</v>

901
00:43:19.651 --> 00:43:24.290
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want you to farm those ideas to other </v>

902
00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:24.580
<v Speaker 3>people because I think guys like you are</v>
<v Speaker 3>insanely valuable.</v>

903
00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:29.610
<v Speaker 3>Like that one person really did sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>germinate the seed and get this project </v>

904
00:43:30.611 --> 00:43:32.500
<v Speaker 3>moving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very unusual.</v>

905
00:43:32.501 --> 00:43:35.020
<v Speaker 3>Outliers like yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very humble guy.</v>

906
00:43:35.021 --> 00:43:36.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you don't think of yourself in </v>
<v Speaker 3>an outlier,</v>

907
00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:41.730
<v Speaker 3>but you most certainly are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the most valuable things </v>

908
00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:45.121
<v Speaker 3>about civilizations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the occasional person who steps out </v>

909
00:43:45.121 --> 00:43:48.811
<v Speaker 3>amongst the masses and does something </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty radical that almost everybody </v>

910
00:43:48.811 --> 00:43:51.220
<v Speaker 3>around them was aware it was an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what you're doing.</v>

911
00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:56.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there could be much more people </v>

912
00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:56.780
<v Speaker 2>that do things like that.</v>

913
00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:56.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I would think so.</v>

914
00:43:56.780 --> 00:44:01.721
<v Speaker 3>But I don't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it's so fascinating about </v>

915
00:44:01.721 --> 00:44:04.481
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iq is that this is not a very common </v>

916
00:44:04.481 --> 00:44:06.170
<v Speaker 3>thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a very common problem.</v>

917
00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:11.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe that's because when you hear </v>

918
00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.400
<v Speaker 2>about people doing cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool shit,</v>

919
00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:17.770
<v Speaker 2>it's usually when they're already sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of doing those things and it's not.</v>

920
00:44:17.771 --> 00:44:19.960
<v Speaker 2>When they kind of started thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

921
00:44:19.961 --> 00:44:22.480
<v Speaker 2>so then I guess people can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>intimidated.</v>

922
00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:25.720
<v Speaker 2>Like how.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to run a company of 100</v>

923
00:44:25.721 --> 00:44:27.920
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know how to uh,</v>

924
00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:33.330
<v Speaker 2>how to get these things done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I looked back at myself four or</v>

925
00:44:33.361 --> 00:44:38.361
<v Speaker 2>five years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really didn't have a bloody clue what </v>

926
00:44:38.361 --> 00:44:40.050
<v Speaker 2>I was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you were a baby.</v>

927
00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:41.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

928
00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:46.530
<v Speaker 2>Five years ago or 18.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

929
00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:47.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

930
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:49.770
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a baby I wasn't even born yet.</v>

931
00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:52.050
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

932
00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:53.790
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that really doesn't matter.</v>

933
00:44:53.791 --> 00:44:55.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean it sits about just getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>started.</v>

934
00:44:55.541 --> 00:45:00.541
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And being willing to learn and just </v>

935
00:45:00.541 --> 00:45:04.670
<v Speaker 2>being open to feedback and just trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>many different things and seeing what </v>

936
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:07.971
<v Speaker 2>works and what doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially at the beginning of done </v>

937
00:45:07.971 --> 00:45:10.920
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of things that didn't work the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first time I tried a fundraising.</v>

938
00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:15.120
<v Speaker 2>I send a cold email to 300 companies and</v>
<v Speaker 2>ask to ask for sponsorship.</v>

939
00:45:15.121 --> 00:45:18.930
<v Speaker 2>And I think one replied and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a horrible idea.</v>

940
00:45:18.931 --> 00:45:20.840
<v Speaker 2>You should go back to school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

941
00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:22.830
<v Speaker 2>so that wasn't heard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one.</v>

942
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:24.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put that one on your wall.</v>

943
00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:26.640
<v Speaker 2>I will do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good idea.</v>

944
00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:28.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

945
00:45:28.171 --> 00:45:33.171
<v Speaker 2>So that was very successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I tried crowdfunding and raise </v>

946
00:45:33.171 --> 00:45:34.290
<v Speaker 2>a few million bucks and allowed us to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get started.</v>

947
00:45:34.291 --> 00:45:35.790
<v Speaker 2>So isn't that amazing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

948
00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:38.670
<v Speaker 2>So it's just about sort of doing this </v>
<v Speaker 2>trial and error.</v>

949
00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:41.610
<v Speaker 2>So just like we developed a technology </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a very iterative fashion.</v>

950
00:45:41.611 --> 00:45:44.530
<v Speaker 2>It's also about developing yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in a,</v>

951
00:45:44.531 --> 00:45:47.910
<v Speaker 2>in an iterative fashion and sort of just</v>
<v Speaker 2>just get started.</v>

952
00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:51.060
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what my point being is that when someone</v>

953
00:45:51.061 --> 00:45:55.020
<v Speaker 3>like you does make something happen and </v>
<v Speaker 3>once you get the ball rolling,</v>

954
00:45:55.050 --> 00:46:00.050
<v Speaker 3>you can be a catalyst for so many other </v>
<v Speaker 3>projects getting launched because it's </v>

955
00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:03.780
<v Speaker 3>attached to you like you're a person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you've got the fire,</v>

956
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:05.190
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got the fire,</v>

957
00:46:05.191 --> 00:46:08.430
<v Speaker 3>so you put the fire over here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now this fire will start here.</v>

958
00:46:08.431 --> 00:46:10.650
<v Speaker 3>Let me bring an end to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this project,</v>

959
00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:14.580
<v Speaker 3>this can start and it seems to me that </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting that fire,</v>

960
00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:19.640
<v Speaker 3>getting that initial ember is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>most difficult aspects and creating any </v>

961
00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:23.331
<v Speaker 3>sort of technology in terms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in terms of something so </v>

962
00:46:23.331 --> 00:46:27.591
<v Speaker 3>complex where you're extracting things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are potentially dangerous from the </v>

963
00:46:28.111 --> 00:46:33.111
<v Speaker 3>environment and creating a net positive </v>
<v Speaker 3>effect and then using that plastic to </v>

964
00:46:33.111 --> 00:46:34.680
<v Speaker 3>recycle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so much good Karma,</v>

965
00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:37.680
<v Speaker 3>for lack of a better word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>attached to something like that.</v>

966
00:46:37.681 --> 00:46:39.870
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and for a person like me,</v>

967
00:46:39.871 --> 00:46:43.770
<v Speaker 3>when I hear that your sunglasses are </v>
<v Speaker 3>made from the Pacific garbage patch,</v>

968
00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:45.000
<v Speaker 3>I get excited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

969
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:47.220
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where can I buy these fucking sunglasses</v>

970
00:46:47.221 --> 00:46:48.120
<v Speaker 3>next year?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

971
00:46:48.121 --> 00:46:50.020
<v Speaker 3>well I'll buy him that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>

972
00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:55.070
<v Speaker 3>that does get exciting to be bold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it seems to me that this excitement </v>

973
00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:59.361
<v Speaker 3>that you're bringing is contagious and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you could potentially use it to spread </v>

974
00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:04.920
<v Speaker 3>other ideas that could also be </v>
<v Speaker 3>environmentally positive.</v>

975
00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:09.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I certainly hope that our people </v>

976
00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:10.520
<v Speaker 2>will think about sort of what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ocean cleanup can I built,</v>

977
00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:12.590
<v Speaker 2>which isn't cleaning plastic from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ocean.</v>

978
00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:15.800
<v Speaker 2>So I hope people sort of already do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

979
00:47:15.830 --> 00:47:17.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

980
00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:18.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good point.</v>

981
00:47:18.831 --> 00:47:22.730
<v Speaker 2>I should sort of think about sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what to do with these other ideas.</v>

982
00:47:22.731 --> 00:47:27.731
<v Speaker 2>Like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few of them are sort of thought about </v>

983
00:47:27.731 --> 00:47:28.790
<v Speaker 2>that I kind of want to do myself </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually,</v>

984
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:34.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would not be in the next few </v>

985
00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:34.190
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but burning.</v>

986
00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:34.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have like a long</v>

987
00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:38.120
<v Speaker 3>term plan for other stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to do if you,</v>

988
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:40.600
<v Speaker 3>the oceans are all beautiful and blue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

989
00:47:40.601 --> 00:47:41.050
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

990
00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:44.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean what do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the goal is really to help ourselves</v>

991
00:47:44.511 --> 00:47:45.200
<v Speaker 2>out of business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

992
00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:50.260
<v Speaker 2>So one day we hope we're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be the garbage man of </v>

993
00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:53.300
<v Speaker 2>the ocean forever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of not the best title anyway.</v>

994
00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:55.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

995
00:47:55.310 --> 00:48:00.310
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we did target that we set for </v>

996
00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:01.400
<v Speaker 2>the ocean cleanup bulls to really get to</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 90 percent reduction by by 2040,</v>

997
00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:06.970
<v Speaker 2>which is incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is achievable both on the </v>

998
00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:09.610
<v Speaker 2>influx side and the stock side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

999
00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:12.080
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1000
00:48:12.081 --> 00:48:17.081
<v Speaker 2>but I think that already before that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe five years from now it </v>

1001
00:48:18.321 --> 00:48:23.321
<v Speaker 2>will just be sort of a steady operation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then for me it wouldn't be very </v>

1002
00:48:23.811 --> 00:48:24.800
<v Speaker 2>exciting anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1003
00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:28.880
<v Speaker 2>I would be involved until really the </v>
<v Speaker 2>end,</v>

1004
00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:31.760
<v Speaker 2>but maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1005
00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:34.070
<v Speaker 2>maybe at some point in time I will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to,</v>

1006
00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:37.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to sort of broaden my time over multiple</v>

1007
00:48:37.311 --> 00:48:37.670
<v Speaker 2>project.</v>

1008
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:38.750
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1009
00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:40.630
<v Speaker 2>that's at least years away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1010
00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:46.180
<v Speaker 2>because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course there's still a lot of things </v>

1011
00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:48.521
<v Speaker 2>that need to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to first prove the technology </v>

1012
00:48:48.521 --> 00:48:49.220
<v Speaker 2>first and foremost this year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1013
00:48:49.221 --> 00:48:51.170
<v Speaker 2>then we have to scale up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1014
00:48:51.450 --> 00:48:54.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>raise hundreds of millions to build this</v>

1015
00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:55.790
<v Speaker 2>entire fleet out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1016
00:48:55.791 --> 00:48:57.560
<v Speaker 2>then therefore more patches in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1017
00:48:58.370 --> 00:49:03.370
<v Speaker 2>We need to make it into a self </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustainable business and then we also </v>

1018
00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:03.980
<v Speaker 2>need to think about what can we do on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the source side.</v>

1019
00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:09.430
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's quite a few pieces of the </v>

1020
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:09.890
<v Speaker 2>puzzle is still there to be a to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>found and put together.</v>

1021
00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1022
00:49:11.601 --> 00:49:14.270
<v Speaker 2>So I won't be bored for the next few </v>
<v Speaker 2>years for sure.</v>

1023
00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:19.330
<v Speaker 3>You certainly won't be one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons why I'm asking this about you </v>

1024
00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:24.190
<v Speaker 3>and what your ideas are with cleaning up</v>
<v Speaker 3>other problems in the world as because </v>

1025
00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:30.460
<v Speaker 3>there's millions of people listening to </v>
<v Speaker 3>this and there might be another boy in </v>

1026
00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:32.360
<v Speaker 3>out there who's a young kid who says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1027
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:36.290
<v Speaker 3>why don't we do this or how come this </v>
<v Speaker 3>hasn't been done or why,</v>

1028
00:49:36.291 --> 00:49:38.960
<v Speaker 3>why hasn't someone tried this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And next thing you know,</v>

1029
00:49:39.590 --> 00:49:44.590
<v Speaker 3>someone who's figuring out how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>extract heavy metals out of the bottom </v>

1030
00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:44.590
<v Speaker 3>of the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure,</v>

1031
00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:48.030
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the thing that will be will be </v>

1032
00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:50.350
<v Speaker 2>great and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd definitely welcome people to sort of</v>

1033
00:49:50.351 --> 00:49:54.130
<v Speaker 2>just to start and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1034
00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:55.510
<v Speaker 2>What kind of other thoughts?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1035
00:49:55.511 --> 00:50:00.511
<v Speaker 2>I think another thing that's important </v>
<v Speaker 2>then when people try and solve problems </v>

1036
00:50:00.941 --> 00:50:04.000
<v Speaker 2>is that they actually think about how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>solve the problem.</v>

1037
00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:06.850
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

1038
00:50:06.851 --> 00:50:08.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1039
00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:11.020
<v Speaker 2>very well meaning and they want to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved.</v>

1040
00:50:11.021 --> 00:50:16.021
<v Speaker 2>But then what happens is that they sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of think about it so at least I can kind</v>

1041
00:50:16.631 --> 00:50:19.180
<v Speaker 2>of make a dent and then hopefully that </v>
<v Speaker 2>dense sort of grows.</v>

1042
00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:24.480
<v Speaker 2>But I think what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a lot of people forget to do is </v>

1043
00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:26.020
<v Speaker 2>that when they sort of start tackling a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

1044
00:50:26.021 --> 00:50:31.021
<v Speaker 2>they forget,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of look at the whole problem with </v>

1045
00:50:31.021 --> 00:50:33.611
<v Speaker 2>first and see what sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's required to actually solve the </v>

1046
00:50:33.611 --> 00:50:33.611
<v Speaker 2>whole problem.</v>

1047
00:50:33.611 --> 00:50:36.500
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm sort of reason your way </v>
<v Speaker 2>back to,</v>

1048
00:50:36.501 --> 00:50:41.501
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the first step that I need to </v>

1049
00:50:41.501 --> 00:50:41.870
<v Speaker 2>take?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you don't do that well then I</v>

1050
00:50:41.871 --> 00:50:46.871
<v Speaker 2>think it will be very hard to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>get the scale you need to actually sort </v>

1051
00:50:46.871 --> 00:50:47.570
<v Speaker 2>of solve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>solve the problem.</v>

1052
00:50:47.590 --> 00:50:48.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1053
00:50:48.621 --> 00:50:49.460
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1054
00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:52.460
<v Speaker 2>I can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be quite intimidating to think about</v>

1055
00:50:52.461 --> 00:50:53.930
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1056
00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:59.050
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that would get us to much more </v>

1057
00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:02.460
<v Speaker 2>sort of effective solutions to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this sort of top down problem solving as</v>

1058
00:51:02.541 --> 00:51:05.990
<v Speaker 2>I would call it instead of sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottom up some problem solving.</v>

1059
00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:11.560
<v Speaker 3>So when have you talked to anybody that </v>
<v Speaker 3>also had an idea of how to clean up the </v>

1060
00:51:12.831 --> 00:51:13.880
<v Speaker 3>Pacific garbage patch?</v>

1061
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:19.060
<v Speaker 2>Now I've read about other proposals from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the past for sure.</v>

1062
00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:21.980
<v Speaker 3>But no one is really actively pursued </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

1063
00:51:22.350 --> 00:51:24.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I didn't know.</v>

1064
00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:29.300
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is of course all those </v>
<v Speaker 2>other ideas were based on sort of boats </v>

1065
00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:32.730
<v Speaker 2>and nets that would go fishing plastic </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking 79,000</v>

1066
00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:33.900
<v Speaker 2>years for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for just one.</v>

1067
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:34.120
<v Speaker 2>Pat.</v>

1068
00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:39.180
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was one that I saw that looked </v>

1069
00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:41.071
<v Speaker 3>like some gigantic floating thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looked like a spaceship and he was </v>

1070
00:51:41.071 --> 00:51:44.320
<v Speaker 3>kinda like moving across the surface,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of skimming it.</v>

1071
00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:45.190
<v Speaker 3>Is that one of those</v>

1072
00:51:46.330 --> 00:51:51.330
<v Speaker 2>see actually the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some artist's impression of one of our </v>

1073
00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:54.720
<v Speaker 2>earlier concept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's probably what it was.</v>

1074
00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:55.670
<v Speaker 2>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1075
00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:56.490
<v Speaker 2>that was ours.</v>

1076
00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:58.400
<v Speaker 3>What other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1077
00:51:58.401 --> 00:52:03.401
<v Speaker 3>if you don't mind talking about them and</v>
<v Speaker 3>what other ideas have you had in terms </v>

1078
00:52:03.401 --> 00:52:03.401
<v Speaker 3>of like cleaning things up?</v>

1079
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:07.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of hesitant to joke about them,</v>

1080
00:52:07.591 --> 00:52:11.400
<v Speaker 2>but I mean there's plenty of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems out there.</v>

1081
00:52:11.401 --> 00:52:14.670
<v Speaker 2>So if you just think about sort of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>are their big problems are out there.</v>

1082
00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:19.150
<v Speaker 2>How about water pollution?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1083
00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:22.440
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I usually what I do is like she,</v>

1084
00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:27.650
<v Speaker 2>I try and actively forced these ideas </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of my head just because sort of once</v>

1085
00:52:27.661 --> 00:52:31.350
<v Speaker 2>you have an idea it sort of starts to </v>
<v Speaker 2>grow and then sometimes you know,</v>

1086
00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:33.370
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with any project you're doing there,</v>

1087
00:52:33.371 --> 00:52:38.371
<v Speaker 2>there are these weeks that things don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>go very well and sort of everything </v>

1088
00:52:38.371 --> 00:52:40.190
<v Speaker 2>seems to be against you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in those weeks though,</v>

1089
00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:45.250
<v Speaker 2>it's very tempting to start thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about well at this other idea and you </v>

1090
00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:49.671
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sort of starts to grow and you </v>

1091
00:52:49.671 --> 00:52:49.690
<v Speaker 2>should be careful that it doesn't take </v>
<v Speaker 2>over your entire month.</v>

1092
00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:51.260
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know what you're saying too.</v>

1093
00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:52.860
<v Speaker 2>Scattered and spread out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1094
00:52:52.861 --> 00:52:56.000
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's of paramount importance </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the,</v>

1095
00:52:56.150 --> 00:53:01.150
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the Azure team to happen is that I </v>

1096
00:53:01.150 --> 00:53:03.000
<v Speaker 2>stay 100 percent focused on what we do </v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's one mission rid the oceans of</v>

1097
00:53:03.001 --> 00:53:08.001
<v Speaker 2>plastic and that's what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I usually do is I sort of write </v>

1098
00:53:08.001 --> 00:53:12.861
<v Speaker 2>them down in my notebook and keep it </v>
<v Speaker 2>next to my bed and that's where it stays</v>

1099
00:53:13.921 --> 00:53:18.921
<v Speaker 2>until maybe a few years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So probably when you were to ask me </v>

1100
00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:21.750
<v Speaker 2>what's the top three ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other ideas that you have,</v>

1101
00:53:21.751 --> 00:53:26.751
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't even be able to say them </v>

1102
00:53:26.751 --> 00:53:30.711
<v Speaker 2>because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're sort of out of my hand and then </v>

1103
00:53:30.711 --> 00:53:30.711
<v Speaker 2>I really tried to keep it there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1104
00:53:31.110 --> 00:53:31.770
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1105
00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:33.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

1106
00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:35.880
<v Speaker 2>what I can say is that they're all sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of technology based.</v>

1107
00:53:35.881 --> 00:53:38.280
<v Speaker 2>So they're all things that are possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

1108
00:53:38.281 --> 00:53:43.281
<v Speaker 2>but I want to make possible in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future and there are sort of all </v>

1109
00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:47.040
<v Speaker 2>connected in terms of negative side </v>
<v Speaker 2>effects of,</v>

1110
00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:49.440
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of civilization.</v>

1111
00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:54.440
<v Speaker 2>And trying to sort of make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't backfire to us.</v>

1112
00:53:55.360 --> 00:54:00.360
<v Speaker 2>What I always like to do is I try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think like if we sort of try to imagine </v>

1113
00:54:01.261 --> 00:54:02.910
<v Speaker 2>a future in 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years from now,</v>

1114
00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:08.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we make sure that civilization is</v>

1115
00:54:09.091 --> 00:54:09.720
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1116
00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:10.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zooming out,</v>

1117
00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:13.170
<v Speaker 2>humanity's still there as zooming </v>
<v Speaker 2>further out,</v>

1118
00:54:13.171 --> 00:54:18.171
<v Speaker 2>just general life can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can prosper and yeah,</v>

1119
00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:23.240
<v Speaker 2>when I look at if I tried to extrapolate</v>
<v Speaker 2>the current situation to the next 10,000</v>

1120
00:54:24.571 --> 00:54:27.060
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we're at that point yet,</v>

1121
00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:29.100
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1122
00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:30.860
<v Speaker 2>it's a challenge that we'll have to sue </v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

1123
00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:36.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly a challenge that we're </v>

1124
00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:37.621
<v Speaker 1>going to have to solve and challenge </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I would hope more people like you </v>

1125
00:54:38.230 --> 00:54:42.520
<v Speaker 1>tackle and start approaching these </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues with the sort of 10,000</v>

1126
00:54:42.521 --> 00:54:45.190
<v Speaker 1>year mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big one,</v>

1127
00:54:45.191 --> 00:54:47.890
<v Speaker 1>of course with the ocean is overfishing.</v>

1128
00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:49.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1129
00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:51.300
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1130
00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:54.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing say retinue of credit,</v>

1131
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:57.840
<v Speaker 2>of excitement and a lot of startups in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the area of,</v>

1132
00:54:59.010 --> 00:55:00.840
<v Speaker 2>of artificial meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1133
00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:04.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not artificial fish,</v>

1134
00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:05.620
<v Speaker 2>fish meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1135
00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:11.540
<v Speaker 2>Because there seems to be this natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution from sort of wild hunting to </v>

1136
00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:18.020
<v Speaker 2>farming to sort of this more a lab grown</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff that doesn't involve killing or a,</v>

1137
00:55:20.581 --> 00:55:25.581
<v Speaker 2>all these resources being wasted and on </v>
<v Speaker 2>land were kind of in Stage two now is </v>

1138
00:55:27.810 --> 00:55:30.960
<v Speaker 2>they're going to stage three protein </v>
<v Speaker 2>next few decades.</v>

1139
00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:33.900
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at phishing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still just hunting,</v>

1140
00:55:33.901 --> 00:55:35.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's still just wildcard.</v>

1141
00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:36.600
<v Speaker 2>Most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>

1142
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:37.170
<v Speaker 2>most fish,</v>

1143
00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:42.320
<v Speaker 1>there's some farm raised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also fun to be not as valuable </v>

1144
00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:42.320
<v Speaker 1>or as healthy.</v>

1145
00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:47.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think they also use a lot of wild </v>

1146
00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:47.730
<v Speaker 2>caught fish as a feedstock for these </v>
<v Speaker 2>farmed fish.</v>

1147
00:55:47.731 --> 00:55:51.260
<v Speaker 2>So that's kind of odd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1148
00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:53.420
<v Speaker 2>but that seems to be served as mentor </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution.</v>

1149
00:55:53.421 --> 00:55:57.590
<v Speaker 2>So I think that would be a way to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to kind of solve that.</v>

1150
00:55:57.770 --> 00:55:59.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and m.</v>

1151
00:55:59.870 --> 00:56:01.340
<v Speaker 1>But isn't there a potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1152
00:56:01.341 --> 00:56:04.760
<v Speaker 1>if we're looking at this in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm of what we've done with plastic</v>

1153
00:56:04.761 --> 00:56:08.600
<v Speaker 1>and the downside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's potential downsides to even this</v>

1154
00:56:08.601 --> 00:56:13.601
<v Speaker 1>lab grown stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we don't know really the health </v>

1155
00:56:13.601 --> 00:56:16.940
<v Speaker 1>consequences of consuming it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what the side effects are.</v>

1156
00:56:16.941 --> 00:56:21.260
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what sort of byproducts </v>
<v Speaker 1>are created in manufacturing this stuff.</v>

1157
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:22.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1158
00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:24.370
<v Speaker 1>possibly and we need to</v>

1159
00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:27.560
<v Speaker 2>look carefully at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1160
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:33.150
<v Speaker 2>but I think a decent paper does have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of potential of being able to do </v>

1161
00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:33.150
<v Speaker 2>more with less.</v>

1162
00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:34.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to wait for awhile.</v>

1163
00:56:34.210 --> 00:56:36.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want,</v>

1164
00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:37.890
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1165
00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:39.570
<v Speaker 1>it just seems to me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

1166
00:56:39.571 --> 00:56:42.740
<v Speaker 1>this could be one of those early adopter</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1167
00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:43.290
<v Speaker 1>It could be A.</v>

1168
00:56:43.790 --> 00:56:44.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disaster.</v>

1169
00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:45.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1170
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:47.470
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1171
00:56:48.930 --> 00:56:50.450
<v Speaker 2>I show that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good testing there.</v>

1172
00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:52.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they do too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1173
00:56:52.001 --> 00:56:53.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I'm just ignorant,</v>

1174
00:56:53.830 --> 00:56:56.320
<v Speaker 1>but I'm still paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just go,</v>

1175
00:56:56.321 --> 00:56:58.000
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

1176
00:56:58.030 --> 00:57:00.010
<v Speaker 1>How'd you make that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You made it out in the lab.</v>

1177
00:57:00.011 --> 00:57:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good luck eaten it.</v>

1178
00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:02.350
<v Speaker 1>I'll be over here.</v>

1179
00:57:03.690 --> 00:57:06.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny how thinks sort of,</v>

1180
00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:07.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1181
00:57:07.810 --> 00:57:12.810
<v Speaker 2>something's just take a lot of time to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of get used to another thing sort </v>

1182
00:57:12.810 --> 00:57:12.810
<v Speaker 2>of once it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's there.</v>

1183
00:57:12.810 --> 00:57:16.190
<v Speaker 2>You kind of used to it in a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The example,</v>

1184
00:57:16.191 --> 00:57:19.250
<v Speaker 2>like earlier this week I was driving a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1185
00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:21.610
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tesla on,</v>

1186
00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:26.700
<v Speaker 2>on autopilot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as driving it for five minutes and </v>

1187
00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:31.140
<v Speaker 2>then already you're kind of doing your </v>
<v Speaker 2>emails and then when you take it off,</v>

1188
00:57:31.141 --> 00:57:35.700
<v Speaker 2>it just feels like you're back in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>stone ages when you're just kind of have</v>

1189
00:57:35.701 --> 00:57:37.350
<v Speaker 2>to drive this yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so weird.</v>

1190
00:57:37.351 --> 00:57:38.180
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you,</v>

1191
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:38.900
<v Speaker 2>you do your</v>

1192
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:44.000
<v Speaker 1>email while you're driving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not even paying attention to the </v>

1193
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:44.670
<v Speaker 1>machine and make sure that it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit some homeless lady who steps out off</v>

1194
00:57:44.671 --> 00:57:49.671
<v Speaker 1>the median,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say this did happen over a car.</v>

1195
00:57:53.110 --> 00:57:58.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think this things like this </v>

1196
00:57:58.110 --> 00:58:01.510
<v Speaker 2>will come up more rapidly than people </v>
<v Speaker 2>think and I think people will be very,</v>

1197
00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:03.310
<v Speaker 2>very quickly that we'll use to it.</v>

1198
00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:08.340
<v Speaker 1>But aren't you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to like look at the </v>

1199
00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:08.340
<v Speaker 1>road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1200
00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:08.340
<v Speaker 1>And that's supposed to be staring down </v>
<v Speaker 1>at your laptop.</v>

1201
00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:08.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1202
00:58:08.531 --> 00:58:12.310
<v Speaker 1>I just erase everything I said for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past minute or two.</v>

1203
00:58:12.370 --> 00:58:17.370
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen the video of the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>is falling asleep and San Francisco </v>

1204
00:58:17.370 --> 00:58:20.131
<v Speaker 1>traffic now he's completely asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's behind the wheel that tesla like </v>

1205
00:58:20.131 --> 00:58:23.450
<v Speaker 1>this and the car's slowing and going </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the pace of traffic.</v>

1206
00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:27.730
<v Speaker 1>It's really fascinating because this </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened so quickly.</v>

1207
00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:31.510
<v Speaker 1>I remember a buddy of mine got a tesla a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple years ago and he's like,</v>

1208
00:58:31.511 --> 00:58:36.511
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can let my hands off the wheel on the </v>

1209
00:58:36.511 --> 00:58:36.511
<v Speaker 1>highway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1210
00:58:36.511 --> 00:58:36.511
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1211
00:58:36.511 --> 00:58:39.780
<v Speaker 1>that's happening already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not just happening like people </v>

1212
00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:40.180
<v Speaker 1>plug into their navigate here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy look at him.</v>

1213
00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:45.600
<v Speaker 1>This guy is stone dead asleep in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>tesla in bumper to bumper San Francisco </v>

1214
00:58:46.691 --> 00:58:50.960
<v Speaker 1>traffic and the car is performing </v>
<v Speaker 1>flawlessly and hurt their business.</v>

1215
00:58:51.250 --> 00:58:53.900
<v Speaker 2>This Dutch guy actually just went to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>back office,</v>

1216
00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:57.340
<v Speaker 2>like on the back seat and started </v>
<v Speaker 2>changing his clothes and.</v>

1217
00:58:57.341 --> 00:58:58.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1218
00:58:58.301 --> 00:59:03.301
<v Speaker 2>and then apparently that they now </v>
<v Speaker 2>included the safety feature that you </v>

1219
00:59:03.301 --> 00:59:03.470
<v Speaker 2>kind of have to touch the wheel every </v>
<v Speaker 2>minute of it.</v>

1220
00:59:03.790 --> 00:59:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a new thing.</v>

1221
00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:06.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>BMW,</v>

1222
00:59:06.821 --> 00:59:08.410
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a similar system,</v>

1223
00:59:08.411 --> 00:59:10.390
<v Speaker 1>but you have to have your hand on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wheel at all times.</v>

1224
00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty better until it's flawless.</v>

1225
00:59:13.310 --> 00:59:14.310
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1226
00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>

1227
00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:20.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People probably do and all kinds of </v>

1228
00:59:20.970 --> 00:59:20.970
<v Speaker 1>freaky shit in their cars while this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing is on autopilot,</v>

1229
00:59:20.970 --> 00:59:21.170
<v Speaker 1>it's really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1230
00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:23.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite amazing how,</v>

1231
00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:28.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just about to show a video of </v>

1232
00:59:28.690 --> 00:59:30.970
<v Speaker 1>Tesla autopilot crash compilations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saving people from crashes is what it's.</v>

1233
00:59:31.530 --> 00:59:32.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1234
00:59:32.661 --> 00:59:37.661
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's unbelievable is how few crashes </v>

1235
00:59:37.661 --> 00:59:39.590
<v Speaker 1>there are and they said they'd been two </v>
<v Speaker 1>fatalities so far.</v>

1236
00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:44.620
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many fatalities per capita versus </v>

1237
00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:46.900
<v Speaker 1>non autopilot cars?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1238
00:59:46.901 --> 00:59:48.350
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine it's far less.</v>

1239
00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:51.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously these cars are also just safer</v>

1240
00:59:51.411 --> 00:59:56.411
<v Speaker 2>in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're not much safer than a 19 </v>

1241
00:59:56.411 --> 00:59:59.660
<v Speaker 2>nineties Toyota Corolla or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in terms of the way the construction.</v>

1242
00:59:59.810 --> 01:00:01.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just safer when they crashed,</v>

1243
01:00:01.511 --> 01:00:04.610
<v Speaker 2>so I didn't know how they compared the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sisters statistics,</v>

1244
01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:06.840
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1245
01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:09.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very impressed too.</v>

1246
01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:10.340
<v Speaker 2>It was fun trying it out.</v>

1247
01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:12.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm impressed and I'm very hopeful.</v>

1248
01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:17.810
<v Speaker 1>The only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my only concern I had my friend Matt </v>

1249
01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:20.360
<v Speaker 1>Farah was on last week and he's a car </v>
<v Speaker 1>expert and they've actually started an </v>

1250
01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.140
<v Speaker 1>organization to save human driving </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1251
01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:25.720
<v Speaker 1>They're literally going to be like </v>
<v Speaker 1>lobbyists to,</v>

1252
01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:29.280
<v Speaker 1>to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't get Ben.</v>

1253
01:00:29.730 --> 01:00:30.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1254
01:00:30.061 --> 01:00:35.061
<v Speaker 1>that's the concern is that one day </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to say you cannot drive </v>

1255
01:00:35.061 --> 01:00:36.300
<v Speaker 1>your own car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're really worried that.</v>

1256
01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:38.130
<v Speaker 1>What was the name of his organization?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember?</v>

1257
01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:40.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1258
01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:42.450
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1259
01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:44.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very serious.</v>

1260
01:00:44.041 --> 01:00:49.041
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to happen quicker than you </v>

1261
01:00:49.041 --> 01:00:49.041
<v Speaker 1>think you're going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be very difficult to drive</v>

1262
01:00:49.041 --> 01:00:51.000
<v Speaker 1>your own car and then it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal.</v>

1263
01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:56.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they should keep areas like the </v>

1264
01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:56.140
<v Speaker 2>highway one or anything like that.</v>

1265
01:00:56.140 --> 01:01:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Just something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some freaky road or people can get </v>

1266
01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:00.100
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1267
01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:00.100
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm steering.</v>

1268
01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:01.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm hitting my own brakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1269
01:01:02.430 --> 01:01:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1270
01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:08.880
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are things that it's most likely </v>

1271
01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:08.880
<v Speaker 1>inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1272
01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:09.520
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this technology,</v>

1273
01:01:09.521 --> 01:01:11.410
<v Speaker 1>the way it's progressing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be safer.</v>

1274
01:01:11.411 --> 01:01:13.600
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be healthier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lower emissions.</v>

1275
01:01:13.601 --> 01:01:18.601
<v Speaker 1>All these variables that are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come into play where people are gonna </v>

1276
01:01:18.601 --> 01:01:19.030
<v Speaker 1>say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just the benefit of driving your</v>

1277
01:01:19.031 --> 01:01:21.340
<v Speaker 1>own car is not worth the detriment to </v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

1278
01:01:21.790 --> 01:01:23.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And next to that,</v>

1279
01:01:23.970 --> 01:01:28.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just if you think about the normal rate </v>

1280
01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:31.300
<v Speaker 2>of converting the entire car fleet to </v>
<v Speaker 2>electric,</v>

1281
01:01:31.301 --> 01:01:36.301
<v Speaker 2>it would be around 20 years because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of how long cars last and </v>

1282
01:01:36.301 --> 01:01:40.520
<v Speaker 2>you only produce a few hundred million </v>
<v Speaker 2>cars a year and there's billions of </v>

1283
01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:40.520
<v Speaker 2>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1284
01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:40.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1285
01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:42.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't want that to take 20 years,</v>

1286
01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:47.940
<v Speaker 2>well I think autonomy than really has to</v>
<v Speaker 2>come into play because if you have </v>

1287
01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:51.540
<v Speaker 2>autonomous cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need much less cars out there than </v>

1288
01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:55.651
<v Speaker 2>you would if you would have to drive </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves because obviously cars are </v>

1289
01:01:55.651 --> 01:01:57.130
<v Speaker 2>just driving maybe three percent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their time,</v>

1290
01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:03.020
<v Speaker 2>their time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just being parked so they can </v>

1291
01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:04.300
<v Speaker 2>drive themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the utilization of the number of</v>

1292
01:02:04.301 --> 01:02:06.800
<v Speaker 2>cars will be much higher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1293
01:02:06.930 --> 01:02:10.450
<v Speaker 2>I think that whole transition to </v>
<v Speaker 2>electric cars would happen much faster.</v>

1294
01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:15.800
<v Speaker 1>It's a human driving or association,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Human Driving Association is what it </v>

1295
01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:16.330
<v Speaker 1>is here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull it,</v>

1296
01:02:16.331 --> 01:02:17.340
<v Speaker 1>pull it back up again so you can.</v>

1297
01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:17.760
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>

1298
01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The war on driving is here.</v>

1299
01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:25.170
<v Speaker 1>A little paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're a little paranoid,</v>

1300
01:02:25.171 --> 01:02:28.980
<v Speaker 1>but you gotta remember Matt Farah is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an automotive journalist,</v>

1301
01:02:28.981 --> 01:02:33.981
<v Speaker 1>so his livelihood depends on talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about cars and he's a real legitimate </v>

1302
01:02:33.981 --> 01:02:36.030
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does this wrong answer?</v>

1303
01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:38.430
<v Speaker 1>What does that pick?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The electric car.</v>

1304
01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you clicked.</v>

1305
01:02:39.991 --> 01:02:42.190
<v Speaker 1>It says wrong answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go there.</v>

1306
01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:43.620
<v Speaker 1>It takes you to their shop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1307
01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:46.530
<v Speaker 1>why is this a shame?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1308
01:02:46.890 --> 01:02:48.190
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just a joke.</v>

1309
01:02:48.570 --> 01:02:51.510
<v Speaker 1>Why would it be the wrong answer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just an an answer.</v>

1310
01:02:52.330 --> 01:02:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Do you drive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you drive an electric car?</v>

1311
01:02:54.931 --> 01:02:55.920
<v Speaker 1>A regular car?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

1312
01:02:55.921 --> 01:02:57.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>

1313
01:02:57.781 --> 01:02:59.900
<v Speaker 1>And why don't you ever read any cars?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have a.</v>

1314
01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:02.730
<v Speaker 1>have a bike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's fucking freezing there.</v>

1315
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coat drive.</v>

1316
01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:08.890
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1317
01:03:08.970 --> 01:03:09.840
<v Speaker 1>Hardcore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

1318
01:03:09.841 --> 01:03:12.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of Holland because a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kickbox.</v>

1319
01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:17.480
<v Speaker 1>So you guys have some of the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 1>kickboxers of all times came from this </v>

1320
01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:18.570
<v Speaker 1>one small place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very unusual.</v>

1321
01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:20.580
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

1322
01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:22.920
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1323
01:03:23.130 --> 01:03:28.130
<v Speaker 1>We just have to punch people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess when you did cut you off at the </v>

1324
01:03:28.531 --> 01:03:29.460
<v Speaker 1>Carthage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1325
01:03:29.461 --> 01:03:32.100
<v Speaker 1>is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Holland is a very unique place,</v>

1326
01:03:32.101 --> 01:03:33.300
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a,</v>

1327
01:03:33.330 --> 01:03:37.290
<v Speaker 1>it's a very unusual country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1328
01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:40.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people wonder why do you think</v>

1329
01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:45.420
<v Speaker 1>this is based on Hollander is there came</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of Holland and for us it makes a lot</v>

1330
01:03:45.421 --> 01:03:48.510
<v Speaker 1>of sense and that we live below sea </v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

1331
01:03:48.511 --> 01:03:53.511
<v Speaker 1>So we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have pray per capita the highest </v>

1332
01:03:53.511 --> 01:03:56.010
<v Speaker 1>number of hydraulic engineers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maritime engineers' blessing.</v>

1333
01:03:56.190 --> 01:04:01.190
<v Speaker 1>So it's just very good access to human </v>
<v Speaker 1>capital and um,</v>

1334
01:04:03.030 --> 01:04:03.690
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1335
01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:08.900
<v Speaker 1>so pretty makes sense for us to be there</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an option for engineering companies </v>

1336
01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:12.030
<v Speaker 1>that support us and are involved with us</v>
<v Speaker 1>contractors.</v>

1337
01:04:12.770 --> 01:04:13.920
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

1338
01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:18.770
<v Speaker 1>So for us it's not pretty very strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know about the other things.</v>

1339
01:04:18.810 --> 01:04:21.840
<v Speaker 1>There's quite a lot of innovation coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>from such a small country.</v>

1340
01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of innovation and really unique,</v>

1341
01:04:24.511 --> 01:04:29.511
<v Speaker 1>intelligent people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've met a lot of people from Holland </v>

1342
01:04:29.511 --> 01:04:29.590
<v Speaker 1>and they just really fascinating people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wim Hof.</v>

1343
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Wim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1344
01:04:30.730 --> 01:04:33.320
<v Speaker 1>I've never met him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fucking guys the best.</v>

1345
01:04:33.330 --> 01:04:35.820
<v Speaker 1>And so lovely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just such an amazing person.</v>

1346
01:04:35.821 --> 01:04:36.710
<v Speaker 1>Every time you're around them you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1347
01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:39.150
<v Speaker 1>feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like somebody like some coffee.</v>

1348
01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:40.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1349
01:04:40.501 --> 01:04:44.010
<v Speaker 1>He's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's very contagious and I mean I have,</v>

1350
01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:46.650
<v Speaker 1>I have quite a few friends from Holland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could check your watch.</v>

1351
01:04:46.651 --> 01:04:47.560
<v Speaker 1>You got to take off soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1352
01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:48.890
<v Speaker 1>So fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1353
01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

1354
01:04:50.581 --> 01:04:53.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am fascinated how,</v>

1355
01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:59.420
<v Speaker 1>how variable people are and how these </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures like Holland sort of arise and </v>

1356
01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:03.570
<v Speaker 1>I just find so many people from Holland </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>

1357
01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:06.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm waiting to meet assholes from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Holland.</v>

1358
01:05:06.031 --> 01:05:08.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you must have them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they do it this,</v>

1359
01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:13.710
<v Speaker 1>they take from that with the people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've met from Holland or friendly and </v>

1360
01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:15.060
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very unusual place.</v>

1361
01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1362
01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1363
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:18.570
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1364
01:05:18.571 --> 01:05:21.520
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of feel the same way about the US</v>

1365
01:05:21.521 --> 01:05:22.980
<v Speaker 2>west coast as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1366
01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:24.580
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1367
01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:27.790
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'd definitely be able to live in</v>

1368
01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:30.730
<v Speaker 2>a place like San Francisco maybe just </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the.</v>

1369
01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:32.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the high priest,</v>

1370
01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:37.620
<v Speaker 2>the high percentage of engineers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurs that kind of makes me feel</v>

1371
01:05:37.991 --> 01:05:38.660
<v Speaker 2>at home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1372
01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:39.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1373
01:05:39.761 --> 01:05:41.980
<v Speaker 2>but I mean us in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like,</v>

1374
01:05:41.981 --> 01:05:42.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1375
01:05:43.210 --> 01:05:44.530
<v Speaker 2>the people are very friendly.</v>

1376
01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:46.630
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some spots that suck.</v>

1377
01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:47.950
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a few spots.</v>

1378
01:05:47.951 --> 01:05:49.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1379
01:05:49.541 --> 01:05:54.541
<v Speaker 1>you're in a good spot right here and San</v>
<v Speaker 1>Francisco is a fantastic spot in terms </v>

1380
01:05:54.541 --> 01:05:58.591
<v Speaker 1>of innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how well has this been received in,</v>

1381
01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:01.120
<v Speaker 1>in America and particularly in </v>
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>

1382
01:06:01.121 --> 01:06:04.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously you're here to do some </v>
<v Speaker 1>business and talk to some people.</v>

1383
01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:09.420
<v Speaker 1>Is this something that people are very </v>
<v Speaker 1>excited about and you feel like there's </v>

1384
01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:09.420
<v Speaker 1>a lot of momentum behind it?</v>

1385
01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:10.690
<v Speaker 2>Actually us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1386
01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:16.180
<v Speaker 2>the number one group of supporters for </v>
<v Speaker 2>us because we know we fucked up a lot </v>

1387
01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:19.060
<v Speaker 2>with the ocean and it's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's your target,</v>

1388
01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:23.460
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just I think people are very um,</v>

1389
01:06:23.790 --> 01:06:24.850
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very supportive.</v>

1390
01:06:24.851 --> 01:06:27.580
<v Speaker 2>But maybe it's also because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>geography of the patch,</v>

1391
01:06:27.581 --> 01:06:31.630
<v Speaker 2>it's right between two US states like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada but different.</v>

1392
01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:33.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

1393
01:06:33.641 --> 01:06:36.310
<v Speaker 2>so it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1394
01:06:36.311 --> 01:06:38.380
<v Speaker 2>I think we've received a lot of support </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the US.</v>

1395
01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:43.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that our biggest support group </v>

1396
01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:46.120
<v Speaker 2>is from here and like everyone I talk to</v>
<v Speaker 2>here they really want to get into.</v>

1397
01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:49.810
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>

1398
01:06:49.811 --> 01:06:51.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1399
01:06:51.701 --> 01:06:53.620
<v Speaker 2>we're kind of lucky that it's next to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the US.</v>

1400
01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:55.510
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've raised all this money,</v>

1401
01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:58.150
<v Speaker 1>is this going to be a profitable </v>
<v Speaker 1>business?</v>

1402
01:06:59.050 --> 01:07:01.610
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're a non for profit entity,</v>

1403
01:07:01.730 --> 01:07:04.640
<v Speaker 2>so a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not even allowed to make profit,</v>

1404
01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:07.370
<v Speaker 2>but eventually the idea is that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>

1405
01:07:07.371 --> 01:07:12.371
<v Speaker 2>this plastic business would be sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>separate thing and that would then </v>

1406
01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:17.210
<v Speaker 2>create the funding for the cleanup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everything would be reinvested in the</v>

1407
01:07:17.211 --> 01:07:17.480
<v Speaker 2>cleanup.</v>

1408
01:07:17.790 --> 01:07:18.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fantastic.</v>

1409
01:07:18.751 --> 01:07:21.300
<v Speaker 1>So do you have a name for the plastic </v>
<v Speaker 1>business?</v>

1410
01:07:22.090 --> 01:07:22.610
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1411
01:07:22.810 --> 01:07:27.810
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now it's just under the ocean </v>

1412
01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:27.810
<v Speaker 2>cleanup still we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>

1413
01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:27.810
<v Speaker 2>we're actually thinking about some kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of brand name,</v>

1414
01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:29.390
<v Speaker 2>but it's the next year.</v>

1415
01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please let me know.</v>

1416
01:07:30.951 --> 01:07:32.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean we'll promote the hell out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1417
01:07:32.451 --> 01:07:37.451
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a fantastic idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll try to buy as many things out </v>

1418
01:07:37.451 --> 01:07:38.300
<v Speaker 1>of ocean plastic as they can sell deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1419
01:07:38.530 --> 01:07:43.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean think the more things you can </v>

1420
01:07:43.530 --> 01:07:43.530
<v Speaker 1>buy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe plastic sale.</v>

1421
01:07:43.530 --> 01:07:44.470
<v Speaker 1>Get this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that phone.</v>

1422
01:07:44.471 --> 01:07:49.471
<v Speaker 1>Where are you buddy that makes these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a guy carves all these himself and </v>

1423
01:07:51.171 --> 01:07:54.560
<v Speaker 1>then makes these molds and then hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>paints all of these.</v>

1424
01:07:54.590 --> 01:07:55.760
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1425
01:07:55.761 --> 01:07:57.670
<v Speaker 1>He's a little wizard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1426
01:07:57.690 --> 01:07:59.270
<v Speaker 1>He's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a wizard.</v>

1427
01:07:59.590 --> 01:08:04.590
<v Speaker 1>He's a big wizard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's is actual size or me now I'm a </v>

1428
01:08:04.590 --> 01:08:05.210
<v Speaker 1>little taller than me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

1429
01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:07.130
<v Speaker 1>my head's not that big either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1430
01:08:07.131 --> 01:08:12.131
<v Speaker 1>these things are uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean to have a line made out of </v>

1431
01:08:12.131 --> 01:08:13.130
<v Speaker 1>completely out of ocean plastic would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

1432
01:08:13.310 --> 01:08:14.930
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he'll do a Boyan version.</v>

1433
01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:17.380
<v Speaker 1>That'd be creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Creepy,</v>

1434
01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:19.430
<v Speaker 1>creepy looking at me over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1435
01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:21.750
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1436
01:08:21.790 --> 01:08:24.440
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird phase two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1437
01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:25.990
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

1438
01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:31.020
<v Speaker 1>there's really the sky's the limit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of applications of your plastic </v>

1439
01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:31.070
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

1440
01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:33.380
<v Speaker 1>I fist think it'd be so attractive to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1441
01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:35.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially out here,</v>

1442
01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:40.070
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least posing as being environmentally</v>

1443
01:08:40.071 --> 01:08:45.071
<v Speaker 1>conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of environmentally </v>

1444
01:08:45.071 --> 01:08:45.071
<v Speaker 1>conscious posers out here for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1445
01:08:45.071 --> 01:08:47.210
<v Speaker 1>they would like to just be able to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and they're like,</v>

1446
01:08:47.211 --> 01:08:52.211
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dog's leash is made out of </v>

1447
01:08:52.211 --> 01:08:52.211
<v Speaker 1>environmentally conscious class that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>put in the ocean.</v>

1448
01:08:52.211 --> 01:08:53.890
<v Speaker 1>I was actually a part of the expedition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was there.</v>

1449
01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:56.480
<v Speaker 1>That was a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1450
01:08:56.481 --> 01:09:01.481
<v Speaker 1>I mean really just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think the sky's the limit in </v>

1451
01:09:01.481 --> 01:09:04.640
<v Speaker 1>terms of just the attractiveness of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of plastic.</v>

1452
01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:10.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And on one hand at the problem that </v>

1453
01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.211
<v Speaker 2>everything is made out of plastic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it does give a huge potential for </v>

1454
01:09:12.211 --> 01:09:14.110
<v Speaker 2>alternative materials.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's ocean plus.</v>

1455
01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:19.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you feel you're going to be </v>

1456
01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:21.631
<v Speaker 1>doing when this is done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like say if you get to this point where </v>

1457
01:09:21.631 --> 01:09:22.630
<v Speaker 1>most of the stuff's pulled out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean and what do you,</v>

1458
01:09:22.631 --> 01:09:23.860
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you plan for the future?</v>

1459
01:09:23.861 --> 01:09:25.060
<v Speaker 1>You're 23 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1460
01:09:25.061 --> 01:09:26.800
<v Speaker 1>you can basically do anything you want.</v>

1461
01:09:27.310 --> 01:09:28.090
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1462
01:09:28.570 --> 01:09:33.250
<v Speaker 2>maybe go on a holiday for a month and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1463
01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:36.040
<v Speaker 2>And then I'll probably just be working </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the next one.</v>

1464
01:09:37.350 --> 01:09:42.320
<v Speaker 2>I think this is what I love doing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1465
01:09:42.370 --> 01:09:47.370
<v Speaker 2>I hope I'll get the opportunity to work </v>
<v Speaker 2>on many more problems like this in the </v>

1466
01:09:47.370 --> 01:09:47.370
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>

1467
01:09:47.370 --> 01:09:49.440
<v Speaker 1>So you feel like you will be a problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>solver,</v>

1468
01:09:49.470 --> 01:09:50.400
<v Speaker 1>like that's your thing</v>

1469
01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:53.000
<v Speaker 2>that be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should put that on my business card,</v>

1470
01:09:53.310 --> 01:09:55.280
<v Speaker 1>problem solver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

1471
01:09:55.281 --> 01:09:57.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's essentially what you are,</v>

1472
01:09:57.091 --> 01:09:57.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1473
01:09:58.230 --> 01:10:02.900
<v Speaker 2>I think there's just nothing more fun </v>
<v Speaker 2>than sort of solving a problem as.</v>

1474
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:06.110
<v Speaker 2>And when you think about project like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ocean cleanup,</v>

1475
01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:10.400
<v Speaker 2>you're sure you're solving the southern </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of a massive problem,</v>

1476
01:10:10.401 --> 01:10:15.401
<v Speaker 2>but just the whole road to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like one little problem after </v>

1477
01:10:15.711 --> 01:10:20.711
<v Speaker 2>another little problem and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's just very sort of </v>

1478
01:10:21.531 --> 01:10:26.531
<v Speaker 2>intellectual intellectually satisfying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be sort of confronted with this new </v>

1479
01:10:27.561 --> 01:10:30.830
<v Speaker 2>weird problem and then you can have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of think how to solve them.</v>

1480
01:10:30.831 --> 01:10:32.480
<v Speaker 2>And as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the CEO,</v>

1481
01:10:32.481 --> 01:10:37.481
<v Speaker 2>you're sort of the accumulation zone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the garbage patches it were for problems</v>

1482
01:10:39.411 --> 01:10:44.411
<v Speaker 2>within your own organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everything that other people cannot </v>

1483
01:10:44.411 --> 01:10:44.720
<v Speaker 2>solve sort of end up with with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1484
01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:46.540
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>

1485
01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:49.390
<v Speaker 2>I kinda like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

1486
01:10:49.470 --> 01:10:51.980
<v Speaker 2>it's this fun thinking about things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

1487
01:10:51.981 --> 01:10:55.580
<v Speaker 2>just this week we had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

1488
01:10:55.850 --> 01:10:59.510
<v Speaker 2>I think it was last week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so on Monday that was,</v>

1489
01:10:59.650 --> 01:11:04.130
<v Speaker 2>so we have this assembly yard and there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a fence that was seven meters.</v>

1490
01:11:04.710 --> 01:11:08.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm too far to the left and there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>just this,</v>

1491
01:11:08.541 --> 01:11:10.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this email from the,</v>

1492
01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:11.510
<v Speaker 2>from the government saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1493
01:11:11.511 --> 01:11:14.680
<v Speaker 2>if you don't move it within 10 days you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to stop your operation and I go,</v>

1494
01:11:14.730 --> 01:11:15.860
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1495
01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:16.890
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1496
01:11:16.891 --> 01:11:19.680
<v Speaker 2>so this little problem and you just have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do a few calls and think about,</v>

1497
01:11:19.681 --> 01:11:24.681
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can we now arrange the assembly </v>

1498
01:11:24.681 --> 01:11:25.970
<v Speaker 2>yards in a way that it's still big </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough so we can assemble this 2000 feet</v>

1499
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.160
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1500
01:11:27.230 --> 01:11:31.860
<v Speaker 2>and then the next day turned out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was sort of a slight misalignment of one</v>

1501
01:11:31.861 --> 01:11:36.390
<v Speaker 2>of the connections strips on one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>flotation elements of the system.</v>

1502
01:11:36.810 --> 01:11:41.810
<v Speaker 2>And you Kinda have to figure out how can</v>
<v Speaker 2>we still attach it while I'm sort of </v>

1503
01:11:41.810 --> 01:11:44.460
<v Speaker 2>working with this and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort sort of just details,</v>

1504
01:11:44.461 --> 01:11:47.510
<v Speaker 2>but there are details on a daily basis </v>
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>

1505
01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:52.580
<v Speaker 2>that kind of what makes it fun for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it would all go fall asleep would be </v>

1506
01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:52.710
<v Speaker 2>pretty boring.</v>

1507
01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:54.690
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what's fascinating about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy like you,</v>

1508
01:11:54.691 --> 01:11:59.691
<v Speaker 1>is that your personality perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 1>aligns with this kind of problem.</v>

1509
01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:02.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a very unusual thing.</v>

1510
01:12:02.941 --> 01:12:05.280
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were you a puzzle solver when you were a</v>

1511
01:12:05.281 --> 01:12:07.050
<v Speaker 1>kid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were you into like mysteries?</v>

1512
01:12:07.051 --> 01:12:07.650
<v Speaker 1>Like what is.</v>

1513
01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:10.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just billing thing.</v>

1514
01:12:10.381 --> 01:12:13.050
<v Speaker 2>So actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so one of the things that I did it funny</v>

1515
01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:17.250
<v Speaker 2>anecdote is when it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think it was about 13 years old,</v>

1516
01:12:17.310 --> 01:12:22.310
<v Speaker 2>I had this idea of doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting into the Guinness Book of </v>

1517
01:12:23.190 --> 01:12:28.190
<v Speaker 2>Records with launching a model rocket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was already into those kind of </v>

1518
01:12:28.190 --> 01:12:31.350
<v Speaker 2>things and build them myself and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot up like 300 feet in the sky.</v>

1519
01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:34.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what that then do,</v>

1520
01:12:34.011 --> 01:12:39.011
<v Speaker 2>I was sort of organized this whole thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>with like there was media and we had </v>

1521
01:12:39.011 --> 01:12:43.611
<v Speaker 2>sponsors and we at the university </v>
<v Speaker 2>collaborating and we just had the sports</v>

1522
01:12:43.811 --> 01:12:46.830
<v Speaker 2>field with 300 people who were all at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same time.</v>

1523
01:12:46.831 --> 01:12:51.750
<v Speaker 2>They would all launch the rocket and </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually I think we launched like 213 of</v>

1524
01:12:51.751 --> 01:12:54.490
<v Speaker 2>them at the same time and actually got </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Guinness Book of Records.</v>

1525
01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:57.060
<v Speaker 2>So I always had my projects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's put it that way.</v>

1526
01:12:57.830 --> 01:13:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Have you thought about potentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>working with companies that produce </v>

1527
01:13:04.370 --> 01:13:09.370
<v Speaker 1>environmental waste,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe a company brings you on as a </v>

1528
01:13:09.370 --> 01:13:14.351
<v Speaker 1>problem solver for some sort of an issue</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they have a residual issue of </v>

1529
01:13:14.351 --> 01:13:14.840
<v Speaker 1>something that they produce?</v>

1530
01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:16.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1531
01:13:17.010 --> 01:13:22.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't think it will be very </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting to be a consultant or </v>

1532
01:13:22.010 --> 01:13:22.400
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

1533
01:13:23.190 --> 01:13:28.190
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean definitely sort of after this I </v>

1534
01:13:28.190 --> 01:13:30.531
<v Speaker 2>want to do sort of solve more work on </v>
<v Speaker 2>more bake challenges.</v>

1535
01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like oil spills,</v>

1536
01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:35.050
<v Speaker 1>things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1537
01:13:35.650 --> 01:13:37.030
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can keep guessing,</v>

1538
01:13:37.031 --> 01:13:41.360
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see,</v>

1539
01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:42.310
<v Speaker 1>you'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

1540
01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:44.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure we will see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well listen man,</v>

<v Speaker 1>about this and uh,</v>

1543

<v Speaker 1>I've seen many of your talks.</v>
