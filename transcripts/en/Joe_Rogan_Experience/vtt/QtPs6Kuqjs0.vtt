00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.410
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and Gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please welcome Dan Harris and Jeff</v>

2
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:10.910
<v Speaker 1>Warren.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why it started off that</v>

3
00:00:10.911 --> 00:00:12.830
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just felt weird.</v>

4
00:00:12.831 --> 00:00:16.050
<v Speaker 1>It was weird to start starting</v>
<v Speaker 1>aesthetics as always,</v>

5
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.330
<v Speaker 1>very odd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

6
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.680
<v Speaker 1>welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome Jeffrey.</v>

7
00:00:18.681 --> 00:00:19.530
<v Speaker 1>Nice to meet you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

8
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.740
<v Speaker 1>Dan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First tank experience.</v>

9
00:00:21.741 --> 00:00:23.330
<v Speaker 1>We didn't talk too much about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

10
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.620
<v Speaker 1>he just got out of the sensory</v>
<v Speaker 1>deprivation tank.</v>

11
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if that's a word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dragoon it is a word.</v>

12
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should tell people how you did it.</v>

14
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.850
<v Speaker 1>You basically taunted me on text,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was awesome.</v>

15
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.870
<v Speaker 1>It was called hot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you were saying that you were scared</v>

16
00:00:41.871 --> 00:00:43.400
<v Speaker 1>of being in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might be scared.</v>

17
00:00:43.401 --> 00:00:45.530
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing to be scared of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just water.</v>

18
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not just water because you're</v>

19
00:00:48.411 --> 00:00:53.360
<v Speaker 1>in this enclosed space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't see anything or hear anything</v>

20
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.470
<v Speaker 1>weird or is in your mind though.</v>

21
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.940
<v Speaker 1>Well that is absolutely correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just happened to have a mind that is</v>

22
00:00:58.941 --> 00:01:02.630
<v Speaker 1>really good at panicking and I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrated that time and again to</v>

23
00:01:02.631 --> 00:01:06.350
<v Speaker 1>myself and others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was a little wary that you call me</v>

24
00:01:06.351 --> 00:01:07.280
<v Speaker 1>a chicken and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

25
00:01:07.281 --> 00:01:08.730
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I have to do this thing.</v>

26
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.670
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I did it.</v>

27
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.280
<v Speaker 1>Not without trepidation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was really interesting,</v>

28
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.850
<v Speaker 1>really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you spent so much time exploring</v>

29
00:01:16.851 --> 00:01:21.851
<v Speaker 1>your consciousness and meditating and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just being in your head that I felt like</v>

30
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.260
<v Speaker 1>this is something that you really should</v>
<v Speaker 1>be exposed to you.</v>

31
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.700
<v Speaker 1>You're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I appreciate it.</v>

32
00:01:25.701 --> 00:01:26.480
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

33
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.530
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I realized is I think I need to do</v>

34
00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:33.800
<v Speaker 1>more of it because the brief discussion</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had,</v>

35
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.410
<v Speaker 1>I know we want it to not fully explore</v>
<v Speaker 1>it until we got on the,</v>

36
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.070
<v Speaker 1>on the Pod,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a brief discussion we had afterwards.</v>

37
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.030
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you said is that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>good to kind of explore your boundaries</v>

38
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.580
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something actually that my</v>

39
00:01:46.581 --> 00:01:51.020
<v Speaker 1>meditation teacher has said to me before</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it made me realize I think I need to</v>

40
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.560
<v Speaker 1>get in there and start pushing it a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit in this,</v>

41
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the tank,</v>

42
00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it will help me in lots of areas</v>

43
00:02:00.201 --> 00:02:03.020
<v Speaker 1>of my life because when you don't test</v>
<v Speaker 1>those boundaries,</v>

44
00:02:03.021 --> 00:02:06.890
<v Speaker 1>your life becomes smaller and smaller</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that happens to people with panic.</v>

45
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.660
<v Speaker 1>It will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happens.</v>

46
00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Just people in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's one of the reasons why</v>

47
00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:15.410
<v Speaker 1>people fall into panic is because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have enough experience with</v>

48
00:02:15.411 --> 00:02:19.070
<v Speaker 1>stressful situations to the point where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could just relax and just let it</v>

49
00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:21.980
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that that's one of the things that</v>

50
00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:23.990
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons why I think martial</v>

51
00:02:23.991 --> 00:02:28.220
<v Speaker 1>arts training is very good for people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just for the self defense aspect of</v>

52
00:02:28.221 --> 00:02:31.370
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the aspect of just dealing with</v>

53
00:02:31.371 --> 00:02:35.020
<v Speaker 1>stressful situations on a regular basis</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the point where you're very</v>

54
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.590
<v Speaker 1>comfortable with them and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize that the consequences of this is</v>

55
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.580
<v Speaker 1>it's not really as bad as you think it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

56
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.360
<v Speaker 1>Like most people are terrified a</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical confrontation,</v>

57
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.240
<v Speaker 1>but when you have physical confrontation</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a regular basis,</v>

58
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.810
<v Speaker 1>especially through my favorite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is Jujitsu training,</v>

59
00:02:50.811 --> 00:02:53.540
<v Speaker 1>because there's no striking so you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>get hit in the head,</v>

60
00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:55.670
<v Speaker 1>you're not worried about brain damage or</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of that stuff.</v>

61
00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.700
<v Speaker 1>It's just basically grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that through continual</v>

62
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.240
<v Speaker 2>process of testing yourself and stress</v>
<v Speaker 2>and regular life stresses sort of become</v>

63
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:08.990
<v Speaker 2>diminished.</v>

64
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.130
<v Speaker 3>I think it's really important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

65
00:03:10.131 --> 00:03:15.131
<v Speaker 3>I do some of this in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>been live news presentation is stressful</v>

66
00:03:15.771 --> 00:03:18.770
<v Speaker 3>and I do that a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've covered many war zones,</v>

67
00:03:18.771 --> 00:03:21.230
<v Speaker 3>which is much more stressful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very stressful.</v>

68
00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.720
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think there are areas in my life</v>

69
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.620
<v Speaker 3>where I've closed off because of</v>
<v Speaker 3>claustrophobia in particular.</v>

70
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.980
<v Speaker 3>I need Mris for sir.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I jacked up my,</v>

71
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.010
<v Speaker 3>both of my shoulders and my knee and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't been able to deal with them</v>

72
00:03:34.011 --> 00:03:38.780
<v Speaker 3>because I just won't get in a scanner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeff and I were down at actually at</v>

73
00:03:38.781 --> 00:03:42.320
<v Speaker 3>vanderbilt where they wanted to take a</v>
<v Speaker 3>look in my brain in a scanner while I</v>

74
00:03:42.321 --> 00:03:43.790
<v Speaker 3>meditated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't do it.</v>

75
00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.700
<v Speaker 3>That was a great opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really expensive to get a</v>

76
00:03:46.701 --> 00:03:49.280
<v Speaker 3>neuroscience is to look at your brain</v>
<v Speaker 3>while you meditate.</v>

77
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 3>And I wasn't able to do it because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>afraid.</v>

78
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.470
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I think</v>

79
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.160
<v Speaker 2>afraid of it seems like there's no</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical fear,</v>

80
00:03:58.161 --> 00:03:59.780
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like there's a dog in the room</v>

81
00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:00.860
<v Speaker 2>that's going to bite you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

82
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.070
<v Speaker 2>So why not just force yourself to</v>

83
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.180
<v Speaker 3>go through it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

84
00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:06.070
<v Speaker 3>have you ever expand?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever had a panic attack?</v>

85
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.060
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it panic attack is,</v>

86
00:04:08.061 --> 00:04:10.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we evolved for this fight or flight</v>

87
00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:13.570
<v Speaker 3>instinct where your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

88
00:04:13.571 --> 00:04:17.860
<v Speaker 3>when you're faced with a saber tooth</v>
<v Speaker 3>tiger or whatever with the brain floods</v>

89
00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:21.880
<v Speaker 3>with adrenaline and it is overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made,</v>

90
00:04:21.881 --> 00:04:25.420
<v Speaker 3>it overwhelms all reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you,</v>

91
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>either fight or flight,</v>

92
00:04:27.101 --> 00:04:31.390
<v Speaker 3>in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's flight a flea and you,</v>

93
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.470
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

94
00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:35.560
<v Speaker 3>you can't control your body in many</v>
<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>

95
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.460
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I've had so many panic attacks,</v>

96
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm primarily the ones that people know</v>
<v Speaker 3>about or the one in particular was on</v>

97
00:04:45.461 --> 00:04:47.710
<v Speaker 3>television on Good Morning America in</v>
<v Speaker 3>2004.</v>

98
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.340
<v Speaker 3>When your brain learns how to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets really good at it.</v>

99
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:52.570
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

100
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.640
<v Speaker 3>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't hurl yourself into the,</v>

101
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.640
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least I can't hurl myself into the</v>

102
00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.020
<v Speaker 3>Lotus position and meditated away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is overwhelming.</v>

103
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.530
<v Speaker 3>And so I can't tell myself a story</v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

104
00:05:05.531 --> 00:05:07.510
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not in physical danger because the</v>

105
00:05:07.511 --> 00:05:08.950
<v Speaker 3>body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the brain is just</v>

106
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.120
<v Speaker 2>what you're saying is very interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>about getting really good at it.</v>

107
00:05:13.121 --> 00:05:17.800
<v Speaker 2>There's a term in archery called target</v>
<v Speaker 2>panic and it happens to people.</v>

108
00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:20.400
<v Speaker 2>It happens to target archers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It happens to bowhunters.</v>

109
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.650
<v Speaker 2>And there's a thing that happens where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you literally can't keep the pin on the</v>

110
00:05:25.781 --> 00:05:26.890
<v Speaker 2>target.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your,</v>

111
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.500
<v Speaker 2>your brain won't let you and no one</v>
<v Speaker 2>understands,</v>

112
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.190
<v Speaker 2>like the people that are having it while</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's happening,</v>

113
00:05:33.191 --> 00:05:36.160
<v Speaker 2>they don't understand that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe I can't do this,</v>

114
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.460
<v Speaker 2>but your brain gets so used to freaking</v>
<v Speaker 2>out in this moment that literally you no</v>

115
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:48.430
<v Speaker 2>longer have control and you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you try to make the shot go off as quick</v>

116
00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:50.860
<v Speaker 2>as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll miss by feet and you just,</v>

117
00:05:50.861 --> 00:05:52.090
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You understand it.</v>

118
00:05:52.091 --> 00:05:54.490
<v Speaker 2>Like I practice everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how is this happening?</v>

119
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.480
<v Speaker 2>But if there's this weird overwhelming</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensation of adrenaline and fear and</v>

120
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.580
<v Speaker 2>nerves and the chaos of the moment and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just slam the trigger and the Arrow</v>

121
00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:07.730
<v Speaker 2>goes flying nowhere near the target and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>

122
00:06:07.731 --> 00:06:11.720
<v Speaker 2>really common to the point where people</v>
<v Speaker 2>seek psychologists and sports trainers</v>

123
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:14.870
<v Speaker 2>and there's always different methods</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they use to try to keep in,</v>

124
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.130
<v Speaker 2>in a controlled loop system of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of thought process to try to handle</v>

125
00:06:19.131 --> 00:06:19.730
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

126
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.500
<v Speaker 3>Probably like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>athletic trainers would probably the,</v>

127
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.300
<v Speaker 3>the fighting it and then getting into</v>
<v Speaker 3>your head about it.</v>

128
00:06:26.301 --> 00:06:28.700
<v Speaker 3>It's probably the same as when you get</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a slump in baseball,</v>

129
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:29.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

130
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.050
<v Speaker 3>you're just locked up in yourself and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>takes a long time to get over it.</v>

131
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.393
<v Speaker 3>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

132
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.920
<v Speaker 3>in the tank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking a lot about how that has</v>

133
00:06:36.921 --> 00:06:41.921
<v Speaker 3>been just a huge recurring theme in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>life where the ego steps in the thinking</v>

134
00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:47.060
<v Speaker 3>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mind that won't surrender to what is</v>

135
00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:52.061
<v Speaker 3>actually happening right now comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get locked up and can't do what I want</v>

136
00:06:52.271 --> 00:06:54.230
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things jeff and I have talked</v>

137
00:06:54.231 --> 00:06:59.231
<v Speaker 3>a lot about in our time together is</v>
<v Speaker 3>dancing as an I can't do it,</v>

138
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.390
<v Speaker 3>can't do it isn't the right way to say</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

139
00:07:02.391 --> 00:07:06.350
<v Speaker 3>but I've struggled for a long time with</v>
<v Speaker 3>dropping myself consciousness enough so</v>

140
00:07:06.351 --> 00:07:08.400
<v Speaker 3>that I can dance in a way that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

141
00:07:08.401 --> 00:07:09.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a three year old around the house</v>

142
00:07:09.771 --> 00:07:14.150
<v Speaker 3>and we'd like to dance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even around him I get a little in my</v>

143
00:07:14.151 --> 00:07:16.790
<v Speaker 3>own head about it and I think all of</v>
<v Speaker 3>these things are related.</v>

144
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.160
<v Speaker 2>They must,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to be.</v>

145
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.430
<v Speaker 2>It completely makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't make sense to me that you</v>

146
00:07:22.431 --> 00:07:26.780
<v Speaker 2>can't get your brain examined when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>spend so much time examining your brain.</v>

147
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:29.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what's different is,</v>

148
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.753
<v Speaker 2>is this it</v>

149
00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:33.420
<v Speaker 3>interesting time to talk about like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>difference between the brain and the</v>

150
00:07:33.421 --> 00:07:35.550
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm looking at my mind,</v>

151
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.820
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

152
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:40.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

153
00:07:40.291 --> 00:07:42.960
<v Speaker 3>the idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

154
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.770
<v Speaker 3>just because I spend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I spent the last nine years looking</v>

155
00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:51.660
<v Speaker 3>closely at my mind doesn't mean that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've conquered all my neuroses and I</v>

156
00:07:51.661 --> 00:07:54.930
<v Speaker 3>don't know that that's on offer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a gradual process,</v>

157
00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.890
<v Speaker 3>you pointed to something important about</v>
<v Speaker 3>testing those limits and I think</v>

158
00:07:58.891 --> 00:08:01.800
<v Speaker 3>meditation can be really helpful and</v>
<v Speaker 3>testing those limits and I was</v>

159
00:08:01.801 --> 00:08:06.801
<v Speaker 3>meditating most of the time that I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the tank and that allowed me bringing</v>

160
00:08:06.991 --> 00:08:09.060
<v Speaker 3>that kind of focused attention to what</v>
<v Speaker 3>was happening,</v>

161
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:12.750
<v Speaker 3>allow me not to get carried away with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the waves of fear that came in and I was</v>

162
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.220
<v Speaker 3>able to let them pass without hopping</v>
<v Speaker 3>out an embarrassing myself.</v>

163
00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:22.490
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know that I can magically.</v>

164
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.940
<v Speaker 3>I think it's going to be a process</v>
<v Speaker 3>before I can get in an MRI is.</v>

165
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.560
<v Speaker 3>But what I'm trying to say in a long</v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

166
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:30.710
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have damaged shoulders when you</v>

167
00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.270
<v Speaker 2>kind of have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>

168
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:33.790
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know you don't,</v>

169
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:34.850
<v Speaker 2>but you don't even know what's wrong.</v>

170
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.750
<v Speaker 3>I think it's Bursitis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I need to get a diagnosis before I</v>

171
00:08:37.751 --> 00:08:42.010
<v Speaker 3>can figure out whether I got to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>surgery or cortisone shot or whatever it</v>

172
00:08:42.011 --> 00:08:42.500
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

173
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.420
<v Speaker 2>Full range of motion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you put your arms over your head?</v>

174
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:44.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

175
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.610
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should try hanging.</v>

176
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:48.540
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever looked into hang the</v>
<v Speaker 2>southern,</v>

177
00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.200
<v Speaker 2>it's just something else crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to get music from your</v>

178
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.460
<v Speaker 2>shoulders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dangerous dude to hang onto a bar and</v>

179
00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 2>having your weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

180
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.870
<v Speaker 4>really important for the shoulder joint</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's something that very few people</v>

181
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.150
<v Speaker 4>do on a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't do it on a regular basis.</v>

182
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.200
<v Speaker 4>Most people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And even people that work out don't.</v>

183
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.390
<v Speaker 4>And you're constantly compressing your</v>
<v Speaker 4>shoulder,</v>

184
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:12.180
<v Speaker 4>compressing and with poor posture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>compressing it with stress,</v>

185
00:09:12.181 --> 00:09:16.890
<v Speaker 4>exercise and your shoulder needs to</v>
<v Speaker 4>expand.</v>

186
00:09:16.891 --> 00:09:21.891
<v Speaker 4>And it also needs this sensation of</v>
<v Speaker 4>hanging your body weight from your</v>

187
00:09:22.831 --> 00:09:24.780
<v Speaker 4>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's tremendous.</v>

188
00:09:24.781 --> 00:09:28.110
<v Speaker 4>Rear shoulder impingements.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's some doctors.</v>

189
00:09:28.111 --> 00:09:30.090
<v Speaker 4>There's one doctor in particular that</v>
<v Speaker 4>explored this.</v>

190
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.420
<v Speaker 4>See if you could find that guy's name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

191
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:37.610
<v Speaker 4>who stopped doing most shoulder</v>
<v Speaker 4>surgeries and started putting people on</v>

192
00:09:37.831 --> 00:09:40.320
<v Speaker 4>hanging therapy where he just tells</v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

193
00:09:40.321 --> 00:09:41.131
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the beginning,</v>

194
00:09:41.131 --> 00:09:43.710
<v Speaker 4>just have a bar that's not quite above</v>
<v Speaker 4>your head.</v>

195
00:09:43.711 --> 00:09:46.920
<v Speaker 4>So they could just sort of relax your</v>
<v Speaker 4>knees and you know,</v>

196
00:09:46.921 --> 00:09:49.560
<v Speaker 4>if you can't carry all of your weight in</v>
<v Speaker 4>your hands,</v>

197
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.230
<v Speaker 4>just carry a good percentage of your</v>
<v Speaker 4>weight in your hands.</v>

198
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.500
<v Speaker 4>And try to relax your shoulders and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>releases impingements,</v>

199
00:09:55.501 --> 00:09:59.370
<v Speaker 4>it's stretches that joint out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea is that we came from tree</v>

200
00:09:59.371 --> 00:10:02.610
<v Speaker 4>swinging primates and then as tree swing</v>
<v Speaker 4>primates,</v>

201
00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.510
<v Speaker 4>we're constantly doing that and that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the shoulder joint is meant to do.</v>

202
00:10:06.511 --> 00:10:10.540
<v Speaker 4>It's meant to articulate in that way we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you grabbed something swinging and then</v>

203
00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:14.220
<v Speaker 4>not having this full range of motion and</v>
<v Speaker 4>not using it on a regular basis.</v>

204
00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:19.590
<v Speaker 4>Here's this guy's book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm Dr John Kirsch,</v>

205
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:24.740
<v Speaker 4>John M Kirsch and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he came up with this many years ago when</v>

206
00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:30.840
<v Speaker 4>he realized that one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>was messing people up was just they</v>

207
00:10:30.841 --> 00:10:33.360
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their joints weren't being put through</v>

208
00:10:33.361 --> 00:10:36.780
<v Speaker 4>the full range of motion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that by hanging you could release a</v>

209
00:10:36.781 --> 00:10:40.530
<v Speaker 4>tremendous amount of pain and a</v>
<v Speaker 4>discomfort that a lot of people are</v>

210
00:10:40.531 --> 00:10:41.640
<v Speaker 4>facing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That makes a ton of sense.</v>

211
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:45.660
<v Speaker 4>So it seems to me that you guys are</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually saying talking about the same</v>

212
00:10:45.661 --> 00:10:48.660
<v Speaker 4>thing when you're talking about the mind</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're talking about the body and</v>

213
00:10:48.661 --> 00:10:51.450
<v Speaker 4>talking about impingement and you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about where your mind is</v>

214
00:10:51.451 --> 00:10:52.140
<v Speaker 4>limited.</v>

215
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:56.550
<v Speaker 4>I think it's the same exact dynamic</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually that's of what's going on.</v>

216
00:10:56.551 --> 00:10:58.890
<v Speaker 4>Like how would you define what an</v>
<v Speaker 4>impingement is in the body?</v>

217
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:02.510
<v Speaker 4>A blockade,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

218
00:11:02.511 --> 00:11:05.220
<v Speaker 4>like I say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lack of range of motion,</v>

219
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:08.400
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>poor exercise habits.</v>

220
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:13.590
<v Speaker 4>There's a variety of factors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ignoring potential injuries and then</v>

221
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:17.040
<v Speaker 4>restricting your motion to the point</v>
<v Speaker 4>where everything's sort of tightens up.</v>

222
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:19.470
<v Speaker 4>Muscle tissue in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

223
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:23.280
<v Speaker 4>joint tissue like around the shoulders</v>
<v Speaker 4>and any,</v>

224
00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.070
<v Speaker 4>anytime where you're dealing with range</v>
<v Speaker 4>of motion issues,</v>

225
00:11:26.071 --> 00:11:30.420
<v Speaker 4>you have to stretch and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most people very rarely stretched their</v>

226
00:11:30.421 --> 00:11:32.580
<v Speaker 4>shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just something that we don't do.</v>

227
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:35.880
<v Speaker 4>And also most people very rarely</v>
<v Speaker 4>strengthened their shoulders.</v>

228
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.520
<v Speaker 4>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

229
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.780
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a very complex joint mean you look</v>

230
00:11:39.781 --> 00:11:43.860
<v Speaker 4>at the way your shoulders articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's not like there's not anything in</v>

231
00:11:43.861 --> 00:11:46.830
<v Speaker 4>your body that can do this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>things and the range of motion that your</v>

232
00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:49.350
<v Speaker 4>shoulders exhibit while carrying weight.</v>

233
00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:50.760
<v Speaker 4>So you think about all the different</v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

234
00:11:50.761 --> 00:11:52.800
<v Speaker 4>Carrying your kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>picking up a briefcase,</v>

235
00:11:52.801 --> 00:11:56.470
<v Speaker 4>you doing a lot of weird motions with</v>
<v Speaker 4>your shoulders and occasionally develop</v>

236
00:11:56.471 --> 00:11:57.940
<v Speaker 4>little tears.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those tears.</v>

237
00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.460
<v Speaker 4>I started out superficial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get larger,</v>

238
00:12:00.461 --> 00:12:02.440
<v Speaker 4>you injure them more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're playing,</v>

239
00:12:02.441 --> 00:12:04.360
<v Speaker 4>you don't warm up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something pops,</v>

240
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.640
<v Speaker 4>you ignore it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it hurts you for years.</v>

241
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:09.910
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of things that we do to</v>
<v Speaker 4>our bodies that would just.</v>

242
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:13.090
<v Speaker 4>It just compiles and you never handle</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

243
00:12:13.091 --> 00:12:15.520
<v Speaker 4>You never deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't get that Mri,</v>

244
00:12:15.521 --> 00:12:18.850
<v Speaker 4>you don't get therapy and it just gets</v>
<v Speaker 4>worse and worse to the point where</v>

245
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.160
<v Speaker 4>seeing a lot of people get shoulder</v>
<v Speaker 4>replacements,</v>

246
00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.550
<v Speaker 4>so the exact same thing is true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything you just said is true for the</v>

247
00:12:24.551 --> 00:12:26.560
<v Speaker 4>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's exactly the same.</v>

248
00:12:26.561 --> 00:12:30.070
<v Speaker 4>It's conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's repeating the same pattern over and</v>

249
00:12:30.071 --> 00:12:32.650
<v Speaker 4>over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Having some kind of involuntary response</v>

250
00:12:32.651 --> 00:12:34.870
<v Speaker 4>that gets a little bit deeper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little bit deeper,</v>

251
00:12:34.871 --> 00:12:36.590
<v Speaker 4>a little bit deeper each time and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>like your.</v>

252
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:41.760
<v Speaker 4>Your mind is the mental body and it has</v>
<v Speaker 4>habits and it develops bad habits and it</v>

253
00:12:43.331 --> 00:12:46.210
<v Speaker 4>develops limited range of motions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what it can do,</v>

254
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:51.160
<v Speaker 4>and so we ended up in this really narrow</v>
<v Speaker 4>situation inevitably because we ended up</v>

255
00:12:51.161 --> 00:12:53.800
<v Speaker 4>with a particular set of conditioning</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it starts to limit us.</v>

256
00:12:53.801 --> 00:12:57.910
<v Speaker 4>So you use practices just like a used</v>
<v Speaker 4>physical practices to open up your range</v>

257
00:12:57.911 --> 00:13:02.380
<v Speaker 4>of motion to work through impingements</v>
<v Speaker 4>to have more flexibility.</v>

258
00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:04.360
<v Speaker 4>You do the same for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

259
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.670
<v Speaker 4>with meditation or with other kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>mental practices.</v>

260
00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:10.600
<v Speaker 4>I think it's literally the same thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you and that there's just this sort</v>

261
00:13:10.601 --> 00:13:13.420
<v Speaker 4>of a isometric nature between the mind</v>
<v Speaker 4>and body.</v>

262
00:13:13.421 --> 00:13:16.760
<v Speaker 4>It's the same kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It completely makes sense and that was</v>

263
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.950
<v Speaker 4>what we were talking about before the</v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast when we're in the hallway about</v>

264
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.550
<v Speaker 4>just dealing with stressful situations</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the tank.</v>

265
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:27.070
<v Speaker 4>Like if there's a weird freak out that</v>
<v Speaker 4>happens,</v>

266
00:13:27.071 --> 00:13:29.460
<v Speaker 4>like how do you handle it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what,</v>

267
00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:33.640
<v Speaker 4>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was saying that the more stressful</v>

268
00:13:33.641 --> 00:13:37.540
<v Speaker 4>situations that I experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more understand what they are and</v>

269
00:13:37.541 --> 00:13:41.380
<v Speaker 4>the more I can relax,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's also like a matter of</v>

270
00:13:41.381 --> 00:13:46.210
<v Speaker 4>constantly being exposed to these</v>
<v Speaker 4>stressful situations where there's not a</v>

271
00:13:46.211 --> 00:13:51.211
<v Speaker 4>long break in between doing standup or a</v>
<v Speaker 4>long break in between martial arts</v>

272
00:13:51.731 --> 00:13:56.170
<v Speaker 4>training where to the point where</v>
<v Speaker 4>anxiety can build up and then once you</v>

273
00:13:56.171 --> 00:13:57.190
<v Speaker 4>get into it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's almost an.</v>

274
00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.370
<v Speaker 4>It's an unusual situation instead of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>usual one.</v>

275
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.550
<v Speaker 4>That's probably why I probably need to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get in the tank reasonably soon.</v>

276
00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:05.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so say more.</v>

277
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:07.050
<v Speaker 4>If you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is your shot,</v>

278
00:14:07.051 --> 00:14:10.690
<v Speaker 4>but if you don't mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would you say more about that because</v>

279
00:14:10.691 --> 00:14:12.790
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're able to get in the tank,</v>

280
00:14:12.791 --> 00:14:14.170
<v Speaker 4>not only regularly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you'll,</v>

281
00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:17.410
<v Speaker 4>you'll dose yourself with some stuff to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get an attack.</v>

282
00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:19.450
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

283
00:14:19.451 --> 00:14:23.680
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing about stressful situations is</v>

284
00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:24.850
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're always trying to,</v>

285
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.760
<v Speaker 4>once you get comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are trying to push them and make</v>

286
00:14:27.761 --> 00:14:30.070
<v Speaker 4>them more stressful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this most district,</v>

287
00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:34.450
<v Speaker 4>most stressful way to experience the</v>
<v Speaker 4>tank is either edibles or mushrooms.</v>

288
00:14:34.451 --> 00:14:36.640
<v Speaker 4>Those are the two for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mushroom?</v>

289
00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:37.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

290
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:39.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it's just,</v>

291
00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:44.850
<v Speaker 4>it's basically mushrooms without any of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the distractions of your body and also</v>

292
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.970
<v Speaker 4>distilled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a pure culture.</v>

293
00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pure culture.</v>

294
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.290
<v Speaker 4>Mushrooms and.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

295
00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:56.780
<v Speaker 2>but animals can be just as potent in</v>
<v Speaker 2>their edible marijuana is.</v>

296
00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:01.370
<v Speaker 2>You know the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people aren't aware that it's a</v>

297
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.740
<v Speaker 2>completely different psychoactive</v>
<v Speaker 2>substance when it's.</v>

298
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:07.760
<v Speaker 2>When you eat it because it's processed</v>
<v Speaker 2>by your liver and your body produces</v>

299
00:15:07.761 --> 00:15:11.570
<v Speaker 2>something called 11 hydroxy metabolite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's four to five times more</v>

300
00:15:11.571 --> 00:15:15.920
<v Speaker 2>psychoactive than thc and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychoactive in the smoking version.</v>

301
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:19.160
<v Speaker 2>It's very different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why a lot of people when they eat</v>

302
00:15:19.161 --> 00:15:21.580
<v Speaker 2>brownies so strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

303
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:25.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there was a famous nine slash</v>
<v Speaker 2>11 case where uh,</v>

304
00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an audio recording of these cops</v>

305
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:33.680
<v Speaker 2>that took some pop from some kids and</v>
<v Speaker 2>made pot brownies of it and then ate it</v>

306
00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:37.580
<v Speaker 2>and then called the police and called</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine slash 11 on themselves because they</v>

307
00:15:37.581 --> 00:15:40.070
<v Speaker 2>thought they were dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it is one of the greatest audio</v>

308
00:15:40.071 --> 00:15:45.071
<v Speaker 2>recordings of all time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think of dying.</v>

309
00:15:45.131 --> 00:15:47.540
<v Speaker 2>I think time is really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So please send help.</v>

310
00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>

311
00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:51.910
<v Speaker 3>What do you do in those moments?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like do you have,</v>

312
00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:54.250
<v Speaker 3>is that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just interested because you've had,</v>

313
00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.560
<v Speaker 3>from what I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quite a bit of experience with</v>

314
00:15:56.561 --> 00:16:01.561
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics and also isolation tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the right term for sensory</v>

315
00:16:02.051 --> 00:16:03.880
<v Speaker 3>deprivation?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sensory deprivation tanks.</v>

316
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:08.800
<v Speaker 3>So what do you do when the little lamp</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your head starts telling you like the</v>

317
00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:10.860
<v Speaker 3>world's ending or slow?</v>

318
00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.400
<v Speaker 2>Just let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to just relax.</v>

319
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:15.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been there 100 times,</v>

320
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:17.660
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many more than a hundred times really,</v>

321
00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:19.850
<v Speaker 2>but were you really nervous?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really scared,</v>

322
00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:23.120
<v Speaker 2>but what compounds it is trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>control it.</v>

323
00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:28.450
<v Speaker 2>What compounds it is trying to wrestle</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moment away from this experience and</v>

324
00:16:29.181 --> 00:16:31.580
<v Speaker 2>just taking control of it and try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sober yourself up.</v>

325
00:16:31.581 --> 00:16:32.301
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this.</v>

326
00:16:32.301 --> 00:16:33.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to,</v>

327
00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta I gotta get getting control of</v>

328
00:16:35.271 --> 00:16:38.550
<v Speaker 2>the situation and the freak out is</v>
<v Speaker 2>really what compounded.</v>

329
00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.000
<v Speaker 2>That's where the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the root of all,</v>

330
00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:42.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>air quotes,</v>

331
00:16:42.021 --> 00:16:46.240
<v Speaker 2>bad trips come from is this desire to</v>
<v Speaker 2>control failure.</v>

332
00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:47.900
<v Speaker 2>Just surrender.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to surrender.</v>

333
00:16:47.901 --> 00:16:50.730
<v Speaker 2>You've got to relax and resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

334
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:53.000
<v Speaker 2>nothing's gonna happen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be fine.</v>

335
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:56.570
<v Speaker 2>You're going to feel really crazy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to that.</v>

336
00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:01.330
<v Speaker 2>It brings up memories from years ago</v>
<v Speaker 2>from weird conversations you might've</v>

337
00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:06.370
<v Speaker 2>had where you acted poorly or weird</v>
<v Speaker 2>choices that you might've made decades</v>

338
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:10.190
<v Speaker 2>ago or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that crossed your mind a couple</v>

339
00:17:10.191 --> 00:17:11.950
<v Speaker 2>of days ago that you're embarrassed</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

340
00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.100
<v Speaker 2>There's all these different things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll come out that will just your,</v>

341
00:17:15.101 --> 00:17:16.760
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain,</v>

342
00:17:16.761 --> 00:17:20.180
<v Speaker 2>your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your consciousness wants to explore</v>

343
00:17:20.181 --> 00:17:24.440
<v Speaker 2>these because it feels that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>neglected them or that you put them on</v>

344
00:17:24.441 --> 00:17:26.780
<v Speaker 2>the back burner or the you didn't give</v>
<v Speaker 2>them enough attention.</v>

345
00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.090
<v Speaker 2>He didn't give them the attention that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they deserve,</v>

346
00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:34.070
<v Speaker 2>so they're festering and bouncing around</v>
<v Speaker 2>the inside of your mind and I find that</v>

347
00:17:34.071 --> 00:17:38.750
<v Speaker 2>edibles in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very self exploratory experience</v>

348
00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:43.700
<v Speaker 2>and your brain desperately wants to</v>
<v Speaker 2>point out all these areas that it feels</v>

349
00:17:43.701 --> 00:17:47.750
<v Speaker 2>that you might've neglected and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrifying for people and he just</v>

350
00:17:47.751 --> 00:17:51.720
<v Speaker 2>started really freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then not to mention the concept of</v>

351
00:17:51.721 --> 00:17:52.380
<v Speaker 2>mortality.</v>

352
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:56.790
<v Speaker 2>You start thinking about your children's</v>
<v Speaker 2>life and your life and you know,</v>

353
00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:59.430
<v Speaker 2>you get freaked out in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you want to do that?</v>

354
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:04.680
<v Speaker 2>Because I think exploring those things</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes regular life more,</v>

355
00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:08.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes it more palatable.</v>

356
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.490
<v Speaker 2>It makes it more relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes me,</v>

357
00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:14.520
<v Speaker 2>it gives me a perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like having a near death</v>

358
00:18:14.521 --> 00:18:17.010
<v Speaker 2>experience on a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

359
00:18:17.011 --> 00:18:19.710
<v Speaker 2>you get out of a near death experience</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things that people say is</v>

360
00:18:19.711 --> 00:18:24.000
<v Speaker 2>even if it's a near death experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like from a a severe illness or an</v>

361
00:18:24.001 --> 00:18:27.240
<v Speaker 2>injury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a perspective enhancement from</v>

362
00:18:27.241 --> 00:18:30.210
<v Speaker 2>that and you come out of it feeling</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

363
00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.690
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of have a new version of life</v>

364
00:18:33.691 --> 00:18:35.490
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand life now because I</v>

365
00:18:35.491 --> 00:18:38.550
<v Speaker 2>understand the full spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before I was operating in this very</v>

366
00:18:38.551 --> 00:18:41.790
<v Speaker 2>comfortable spectrum of everything being</v>
<v Speaker 2>safe and now I realized like,</v>

367
00:18:41.791 --> 00:18:42.970
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have to be.</v>

368
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:46.200
<v Speaker 2>Say there can be terrible things where</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything can go wrong,</v>

369
00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:50.820
<v Speaker 2>so appreciate this with much more zeal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like much more lust for life if</v>

370
00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:53.980
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like what we do in meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God did.</v>

371
00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.320
<v Speaker 1>I was just thinking that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like a meditation retreat.</v>

372
00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.180
<v Speaker 1>I think they're all connected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These questions.</v>

373
00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:00.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not even taking.</v>

374
00:19:00.571 --> 00:19:02.320
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to ingest anything for</v>

375
00:19:02.321 --> 00:19:04.670
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff to start coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

376
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:08.170
<v Speaker 1>there's a kind of classic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a classic progression in a</v>

377
00:19:08.171 --> 00:19:11.620
<v Speaker 1>retreat or an even in a city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say there are these terrains</v>

378
00:19:11.621 --> 00:19:15.070
<v Speaker 1>you move through where first year just</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get going and then you're kind</v>

379
00:19:15.071 --> 00:19:17.740
<v Speaker 1>of having all these breakthroughs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>insights and then you can get into this</v>

380
00:19:17.741 --> 00:19:20.290
<v Speaker 1>really challenging stage where it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't meditate.</v>

381
00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.860
<v Speaker 1>All your dark stuff is coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I think of it as like,</v>

382
00:19:23.861 --> 00:19:26.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're exfoliating the brain.</v>

383
00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just externally eight exfoliate and</v>

384
00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.760
<v Speaker 1>a send.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hit an air pocket of some old school</v>

385
00:19:30.761 --> 00:19:35.761
<v Speaker 1>shit like your old shame and your rage</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your childish petulance and,</v>

386
00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:40.300
<v Speaker 1>and it all comes bubbling up and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside this atmosphere and then from</v>

387
00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:43.420
<v Speaker 1>inside that atmosphere you're seeing</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything through that filter.</v>

388
00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:47.170
<v Speaker 1>You're now seeing how everything sucks</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your life's a catastrophe or</v>

389
00:19:47.171 --> 00:19:50.080
<v Speaker 1>whatever and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just like you were saying about the</v>

390
00:19:50.081 --> 00:19:52.870
<v Speaker 1>body and about the psychedelics and</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the tank,</v>

391
00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:57.070
<v Speaker 1>you got to learn to be okay with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>own uncomfortableness.</v>

392
00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:00.820
<v Speaker 1>You've got to learn to be okay to sit</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside this discomfort and say actually</v>

393
00:20:00.821 --> 00:20:01.720
<v Speaker 1>to welcome it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>

394
00:20:01.721 --> 00:20:03.370
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just part of what's going on</v>

395
00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.040
<v Speaker 1>with me right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you can do that without</v>

396
00:20:06.041 --> 00:20:07.330
<v Speaker 1>resistance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you were saying,</v>

397
00:20:07.331 --> 00:20:08.890
<v Speaker 1>without fighting with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it,</v>

398
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:13.120
<v Speaker 1>then it can actually work its way out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can get into this really</v>

399
00:20:13.121 --> 00:20:15.570
<v Speaker 1>beautiful stage of a practice where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

400
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:17.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the equanimity stage they call it,</v>

401
00:20:17.561 --> 00:20:20.170
<v Speaker 1>where it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really open and available to</v>

402
00:20:20.171 --> 00:20:21.850
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're super present.</v>

403
00:20:21.851 --> 00:20:25.100
<v Speaker 1>It's not exotic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not in some peak experience where</v>

404
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.943
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

405
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:28.990
<v Speaker 1>melting in oneness and have an energy</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting up your spine.</v>

406
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:31.170
<v Speaker 1>But neither are you in one of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

407
00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.120
<v Speaker 1>low experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just in the,</v>

408
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.710
<v Speaker 1>it's like the beautiful ordinary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

409
00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:36.990
<v Speaker 1>and those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the.</v>

410
00:20:36.991 --> 00:20:38.740
<v Speaker 1>And you go round and round and those</v>
<v Speaker 1>cycles.</v>

411
00:20:38.741 --> 00:20:42.010
<v Speaker 1>And then from actually that beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinary place that you can have these</v>

412
00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.650
<v Speaker 1>breakthroughs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the kind of classic place</v>

413
00:20:44.651 --> 00:20:46.810
<v Speaker 1>where people have these shifts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

414
00:20:46.811 --> 00:20:48.680
<v Speaker 1>they like a no self experience</v>

415
00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.730
<v Speaker 3>or a pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The phenomenology of it is really cool.</v>

416
00:20:51.731 --> 00:20:55.030
<v Speaker 3>Like there's people described very</v>
<v Speaker 3>specific kinds of things happening that</v>

417
00:20:55.031 --> 00:20:59.380
<v Speaker 3>drop them into this next level of our</v>
<v Speaker 3>next progression of insight.</v>

418
00:20:59.381 --> 00:21:02.470
<v Speaker 3>You could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't want to overstate my</v>

419
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.210
<v Speaker 3>meditative capacities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

420
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.310
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a,</v>

421
00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:10.930
<v Speaker 3>I would say probably like a Jv version</v>
<v Speaker 3>of what you're describing a last month,</v>

422
00:21:10.931 --> 00:21:13.300
<v Speaker 3>just a few weeks ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was on a 10 day silent meditation</v>

423
00:21:13.301 --> 00:21:16.330
<v Speaker 3>retreat and I could see as you described</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

424
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:19.600
<v Speaker 3>this progression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could see in hindsight that that was</v>

425
00:21:19.601 --> 00:21:23.980
<v Speaker 3>what I went through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as your mind starts to settle and you</v>

426
00:21:23.981 --> 00:21:27.790
<v Speaker 3>get more concentrated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are fireworks.</v>

427
00:21:27.791 --> 00:21:28.700
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you did the,</v>

428
00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.750
<v Speaker 3>you get a lot of sensations in your body</v>
<v Speaker 3>that feel really good.</v>

429
00:21:31.751 --> 00:21:34.120
<v Speaker 3>You're seeing things behind your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

430
00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the mind releases a lot of dopamine</v>

431
00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:43.480
<v Speaker 3>and Serotonin in response to the reduced</v>
<v Speaker 3>chatter that can happen when you're more</v>

432
00:21:43.481 --> 00:21:46.930
<v Speaker 3>focused on what's happening right now as</v>
<v Speaker 3>opposed to caught up being caught up in</v>

433
00:21:46.931 --> 00:21:49.150
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

434
00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:52.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our egoic chatter.</v>

435
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:55.600
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at one point though,</v>

436
00:21:55.601 --> 00:21:56.320
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

437
00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.250
<v Speaker 3>I hit a stage that's sometimes referred</v>
<v Speaker 3>to as life review where I,</v>

438
00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:03.310
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the things I'm most ashamed of just</v>

439
00:22:03.311 --> 00:22:06.190
<v Speaker 3>started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't avoid him.</v>

440
00:22:06.191 --> 00:22:08.200
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't sleep and it was all just</v>
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>

441
00:22:08.201 --> 00:22:12.670
<v Speaker 3>I was just thinking about them and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started questioning the whole practice</v>

442
00:22:12.671 --> 00:22:15.190
<v Speaker 3>and what am I doing here is just a waste</v>
<v Speaker 3>of time.</v>

443
00:22:15.191 --> 00:22:20.080
<v Speaker 3>And I had a conversation with my teacher</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was a brilliant individual.</v>

444
00:22:20.081 --> 00:22:21.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean you could argue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

445
00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:26.380
<v Speaker 3>some have argued and I would agree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the greatest living meditation</v>

446
00:22:26.381 --> 00:22:29.080
<v Speaker 3>teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his name is Joseph Goldstein and he's</v>

447
00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.840
<v Speaker 3>not a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't walk around in robes or</v>

448
00:22:31.841 --> 00:22:35.020
<v Speaker 3>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a Jewish guy from the catskills and</v>

449
00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:39.010
<v Speaker 3>he's in his seventies and he would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was staying and he in a cabin and he</v>

450
00:22:39.011 --> 00:22:41.260
<v Speaker 3>would pop in and see me in this cabin</v>
<v Speaker 3>every once in a while because it was</v>

451
00:22:41.261 --> 00:22:41.920
<v Speaker 3>right near his house.</v>

452
00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:45.850
<v Speaker 3>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one day I was kind of complaining a lot</v>

453
00:22:45.851 --> 00:22:50.851
<v Speaker 3>about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the futility of my practice and he said,</v>

454
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:53.200
<v Speaker 3>surrender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said,</v>

455
00:22:53.201 --> 00:22:56.320
<v Speaker 3>you got to surrender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to just stop.</v>

456
00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:00.250
<v Speaker 3>Just stop getting in your head about are</v>
<v Speaker 3>you doing it right?</v>

457
00:23:00.251 --> 00:23:03.340
<v Speaker 3>And all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just let the practice do its thing.</v>

458
00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:07.000
<v Speaker 3>As Jeff sometimes talks about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like lead time in nature,</v>

459
00:23:07.001 --> 00:23:10.210
<v Speaker 3>do it's work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just trust that the practices we've been</v>

460
00:23:10.211 --> 00:23:11.980
<v Speaker 3>doing this for Millennia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings,</v>

461
00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:15.430
<v Speaker 3>it was a reason for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just do the practice and stop worrying</v>

462
00:23:15.431 --> 00:23:20.431
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the next set I had was this kind of</v>

463
00:23:21.011 --> 00:23:22.510
<v Speaker 3>equanimity thing that you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

464
00:23:22.511 --> 00:23:27.511
<v Speaker 3>Where I could see was two hours long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could see everything coming up.</v>

465
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.670
<v Speaker 3>All of my urges,</v>
<v Speaker 3>desires,</v>

466
00:23:30.671 --> 00:23:32.440
<v Speaker 3>thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>physical sensations,</v>

467
00:23:32.441 --> 00:23:35.740
<v Speaker 3>things I was hearing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things I was seeing was I was very</v>

468
00:23:35.741 --> 00:23:38.140
<v Speaker 3>focused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But at this point it's all just coming</v>

469
00:23:38.141 --> 00:23:40.540
<v Speaker 3>at me and I'm not reaching for it.</v>

470
00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:42.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't not pushing it away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The unpleasant stuff.</v>

471
00:23:42.791 --> 00:23:45.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to push it away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to grasp onto the</v>

472
00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:49.120
<v Speaker 3>pleasant and it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

473
00:23:49.121 --> 00:23:51.680
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like this incredible video game,</v>

474
00:23:51.681 --> 00:23:52.514
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

475
00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:55.760
<v Speaker 3>where you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sometimes describe meditation.</v>

476
00:23:55.761 --> 00:24:00.590
<v Speaker 3>It's like a video game where you can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>move forward if you want to move</v>

477
00:24:00.591 --> 00:24:02.540
<v Speaker 3>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the anti video games and once you</v>

478
00:24:02.541 --> 00:24:05.900
<v Speaker 3>stop wanting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you just surrender into this thing</v>

479
00:24:05.901 --> 00:24:08.570
<v Speaker 3>where you're just nonjudgmentally</v>
<v Speaker 3>observing,</v>

480
00:24:08.571 --> 00:24:11.090
<v Speaker 3>whatever comes up in your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's fear,</v>

481
00:24:11.091 --> 00:24:12.530
<v Speaker 3>whether it's planning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lunch,</v>

482
00:24:12.531 --> 00:24:15.860
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who you just,</v>

483
00:24:15.861 --> 00:24:19.550
<v Speaker 3>you can start to move forward and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ego comes in and tells you you are</v>

484
00:24:19.551 --> 00:24:24.530
<v Speaker 3>the best meditator ever do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you fall for that for a minute.</v>

485
00:24:24.531 --> 00:24:27.110
<v Speaker 3>But then you stop falling for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

486
00:24:27.111 --> 00:24:28.970
<v Speaker 3>at the end of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I looked down at my watch and for two</v>

487
00:24:28.971 --> 00:24:29.804
<v Speaker 3>hours had passed.</v>

488
00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:32.750
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then I was fully in the zone of</v>

489
00:24:32.751 --> 00:24:33.201
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

490
00:24:33.201 --> 00:24:34.900
<v Speaker 3>this is the end of my next book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

491
00:24:34.901 --> 00:24:35.571
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

492
00:24:35.571 --> 00:24:37.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm enlightened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the best thing ever.</v>

493
00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:41.750
<v Speaker 3>And I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I then a couple of hours later start to</v>

494
00:24:41.751 --> 00:24:44.930
<v Speaker 3>realize that I had been telling myself a</v>
<v Speaker 3>story about how amazing I was and how</v>

495
00:24:44.931 --> 00:24:46.550
<v Speaker 3>they should put a plaque up in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>room.</v>

496
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:50.690
<v Speaker 3>This is where the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best meditation sit ever happened.</v>

497
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:51.570
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

498
00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:55.430
<v Speaker 3>the next meditation I went to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the next time I tried to meditate,</v>

499
00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:58.610
<v Speaker 3>it was as if I'd never meditated before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I just like,</v>

500
00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:01.610
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what I was doing anymore</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it all collapsed.</v>

501
00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.250
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's so much there.</v>

502
00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:07.680
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an experience that you have in</v>

503
00:25:07.681 --> 00:25:11.760
<v Speaker 4>the tank where you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you try to let go and you let go and</v>

504
00:25:11.761 --> 00:25:13.440
<v Speaker 4>relax and then you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

505
00:25:13.441 --> 00:25:17.520
<v Speaker 4>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's one layer of relaxation.</v>

506
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.190
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they're stacked on top of each</v>

507
00:25:20.191 --> 00:25:21.540
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's infinite layers.</v>

508
00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:25.470
<v Speaker 4>And as you get deeper and deeper into</v>
<v Speaker 4>these layers of relaxation,</v>

509
00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:27.840
<v Speaker 4>you hit another layer and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

510
00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:29.370
<v Speaker 4>now this is relaxing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

511
00:25:29.371 --> 00:25:31.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's way more than this,</v>

512
00:25:31.291 --> 00:25:35.580
<v Speaker 4>there's way more to this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the more you think about the fact</v>

513
00:25:35.581 --> 00:25:36.061
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

514
00:25:36.061 --> 00:25:38.670
<v Speaker 4>now I'm on a new level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>relaxation will now you're not.</v>

515
00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.210
<v Speaker 4>Now you're probably two or three levels</v>
<v Speaker 4>above where you were before you</v>

516
00:25:42.211 --> 00:25:43.044
<v Speaker 4>addressed it.</v>

517
00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:46.920
<v Speaker 1>That's the one you were talking to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just seemed like the layers of the</v>

518
00:25:46.921 --> 00:25:50.130
<v Speaker 1>onion and just you have to peel those</v>
<v Speaker 1>layers and you're blowing my mind.</v>

519
00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.720
<v Speaker 1>This is all the shit that I always talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

520
00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:54.120
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly you're describing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

521
00:25:54.121 --> 00:25:55.680
<v Speaker 1>It's the layers of the onion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

522
00:25:55.681 --> 00:25:57.080
<v Speaker 1>it's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

523
00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:59.700
<v Speaker 1>you're holding this fist and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even realize you're holding this fist.</v>

524
00:25:59.701 --> 00:26:00.451
<v Speaker 1>You're walking around going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

525
00:26:00.451 --> 00:26:02.310
<v Speaker 1>everything's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're holding this fist and then</v>

526
00:26:02.311 --> 00:26:04.440
<v Speaker 1>you realize you're holding on so tight</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the need first.</v>

527
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:07.860
<v Speaker 1>You don't even know how to open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fist has been closed the whole time.</v>

528
00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.700
<v Speaker 1>At some point without.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to.</v>

529
00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.940
<v Speaker 1>The way you open it is not trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>open it.</v>

530
00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:15.300
<v Speaker 1>You have to just be so okay with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that you had this tight fist here</v>

531
00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.720
<v Speaker 1>and eventually it just opens up itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you think you're free.</v>

532
00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:21.240
<v Speaker 1>And I think if I'd describe it as like</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk in the onion,</v>

533
00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:22.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're walking on top of the</v>

534
00:26:22.621 --> 00:26:24.840
<v Speaker 1>annuity and unique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's imagined the planet is an onion.</v>

535
00:26:24.841 --> 00:26:27.330
<v Speaker 1>You're walking and you're turning the</v>
<v Speaker 1>onion as you walk and you got the huge</v>

536
00:26:27.331 --> 00:26:30.150
<v Speaker 1>open air all around you that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>university feel like you're free,</v>

537
00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:34.320
<v Speaker 1>but very slowly you're sinking into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>onion is a layer of tension,</v>

538
00:26:34.321 --> 00:26:38.370
<v Speaker 1>is kind of appearing or coagulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That starts to kind of coagulate in your</v>

539
00:26:38.371 --> 00:26:41.550
<v Speaker 1>experience and eventually realized that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this layer of tension here and</v>

540
00:26:41.551 --> 00:26:42.960
<v Speaker 1>you're not free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're inside this thing.</v>

541
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.040
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to figure out how to</v>

542
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:49.100
<v Speaker 4>exfoliate that or let that go and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>just keeps going on because it's turtles</v>

543
00:26:49.411 --> 00:26:52.740
<v Speaker 4>all the way down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's onion layer after onion</v>

544
00:26:52.741 --> 00:26:55.230
<v Speaker 4>layer and every time you get into a new</v>
<v Speaker 4>place of freedom,</v>

545
00:26:55.231 --> 00:26:59.190
<v Speaker 4>the fact and the act of living is</v>
<v Speaker 4>creating more coagulation.</v>

546
00:26:59.191 --> 00:27:03.090
<v Speaker 4>It's creating more just natural</v>
<v Speaker 4>frictions and things that are coming up</v>

547
00:27:03.091 --> 00:27:04.500
<v Speaker 4>so it's not just that you're going</v>
<v Speaker 4>through.</v>

548
00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:08.460
<v Speaker 4>So the the progress of insight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the progress that they call purification</v>

549
00:27:08.461 --> 00:27:12.480
<v Speaker 4>in Buddhism is a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a process of kind of working through</v>

550
00:27:12.481 --> 00:27:15.930
<v Speaker 4>your conditioning but also</v>
<v Speaker 4>simultaneously learning to work through</v>

551
00:27:15.931 --> 00:27:20.640
<v Speaker 4>the new conditioning that's accreting by</v>
<v Speaker 4>virtue of just being a human being and</v>

552
00:27:20.641 --> 00:27:22.110
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the game.</v>

553
00:27:22.111 --> 00:27:24.480
<v Speaker 4>And that's why a lot of people say there</v>
<v Speaker 4>is no end to it.</v>

554
00:27:24.481 --> 00:27:28.860
<v Speaker 4>You don't get to some final liberation</v>
<v Speaker 4>because just the act of living is</v>

555
00:27:28.861 --> 00:27:30.540
<v Speaker 4>creating its own blind spots.</v>

556
00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.100
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you've got different people in</v>

557
00:27:32.101 --> 00:27:35.490
<v Speaker 4>different camps who argue different</v>
<v Speaker 4>things about what real freedom looks</v>

558
00:27:35.491 --> 00:27:36.081
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that,</v>

559
00:27:36.081 --> 00:27:38.820
<v Speaker 4>that to me seems the most realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

560
00:27:38.821 --> 00:27:42.060
<v Speaker 4>at least it's the one that at that fits</v>
<v Speaker 4>with my experience and it describes</v>

561
00:27:42.061 --> 00:27:44.020
<v Speaker 4>exactly how you describe it and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

562
00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:45.540
<v Speaker 4>the two are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they really line up.</v>

563
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:51.110
<v Speaker 4>I think most of us are operating on</v>
<v Speaker 4>momentum and I think you,</v>

564
00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:55.110
<v Speaker 4>you learn things as a child and those</v>
<v Speaker 4>become,</v>

565
00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:57.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever your personality is,</v>

566
00:27:57.151 --> 00:28:02.151
<v Speaker 4>the way with whatever thought process</v>
<v Speaker 4>you sort of have carved into your mind</v>

567
00:28:03.181 --> 00:28:07.350
<v Speaker 4>like the grooves and patterns that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>normally find yourself thinking in.</v>

568
00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:11.070
<v Speaker 4>And I equate it to a lot to martial arts</v>
<v Speaker 4>training.</v>

569
00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:13.470
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to teach martial arts for a</v>

570
00:28:13.471 --> 00:28:14.760
<v Speaker 4>living.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that I've found</v>

571
00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:17.910
<v Speaker 4>incredibly difficult was to reteach</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

572
00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:22.770
<v Speaker 4>It was way easier to teach a person with</v>
<v Speaker 4>no training than it was to reteach</v>

573
00:28:22.771 --> 00:28:26.250
<v Speaker 4>someone with poor training.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when someone has poor training,</v>

574
00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:30.810
<v Speaker 4>they have these paths carved in their</v>
<v Speaker 4>movements and their thought process and</v>

575
00:28:30.811 --> 00:28:33.360
<v Speaker 4>when they're in a situation they fall</v>
<v Speaker 4>back on those patterns.</v>

576
00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:37.350
<v Speaker 4>And it's extremely difficult to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>people out of that and learned to do</v>

577
00:28:37.351 --> 00:28:40.080
<v Speaker 4>things correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you can teach them how to do</v>

578
00:28:40.081 --> 00:28:43.380
<v Speaker 4>things correctly from the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they naturally grow.</v>

579
00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:46.530
<v Speaker 4>Like this is the stressful situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here comes the problem.</v>

580
00:28:46.531 --> 00:28:49.170
<v Speaker 4>Here's the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the technique?</v>

581
00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.480
<v Speaker 4>Now you know it and it's locked into</v>
<v Speaker 4>your brain.</v>

582
00:28:51.481 --> 00:28:54.480
<v Speaker 4>You know the right pathway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether as like don't go to the</v>

583
00:28:54.481 --> 00:28:56.190
<v Speaker 4>technique you've been using all your</v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

584
00:28:56.310 --> 00:29:01.170
<v Speaker 4>Now use a new technique and and remember</v>
<v Speaker 4>to manage that situation under pressure.</v>

585
00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:05.100
<v Speaker 4>I think that's how most of us are</v>
<v Speaker 4>handling our lives.</v>

586
00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:10.320
<v Speaker 4>We're handling our lives with poor</v>
<v Speaker 4>techniques and poor management skills</v>

587
00:29:11.101 --> 00:29:15.540
<v Speaker 4>and and these pads that are carved in</v>
<v Speaker 4>that or infant tile and that are</v>

588
00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:19.920
<v Speaker 4>essentially like the the remanence and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the echoes of when you were a teenager</v>

589
00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:24.180
<v Speaker 4>or even younger than that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then maybe your parents and the</v>

590
00:29:24.181 --> 00:29:27.540
<v Speaker 4>learned behavior that you see watching</v>
<v Speaker 4>them and maybe they weren't so good at</v>

591
00:29:27.541 --> 00:29:30.990
<v Speaker 4>managing life either,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but these patterns are carved into your</v>

592
00:29:30.991 --> 00:29:34.580
<v Speaker 4>brain and you find comfort in them</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you know where they're going to</v>

593
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:37.680
<v Speaker 4>slide right into them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then as an adult,</v>

594
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:41.920
<v Speaker 4>you start trying to remap your</v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness and remap patterns,</v>

595
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:47.250
<v Speaker 4>and in doing that it's very difficult to</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of re think how you think.</v>

596
00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:51.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what you're pointing to here is</v>

597
00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:54.540
<v Speaker 3>close to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what has become,</v>

598
00:29:54.541 --> 00:29:58.560
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the animating insight of my whole side</v>

599
00:29:58.561 --> 00:30:03.561
<v Speaker 3>hustle as a meditation proponent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that the mind is trainable.</v>

600
00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.320
<v Speaker 3>Now we are you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you describe,</v>

601
00:30:05.321 --> 00:30:09.480
<v Speaker 3>I think very accurately the ruts in</v>
<v Speaker 3>which many of us find ourselves or don't</v>

602
00:30:09.481 --> 00:30:14.400
<v Speaker 3>even know we're in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the good news is that there are ways</v>

603
00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:18.660
<v Speaker 3>to retrain the mind week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't know that until my late</v>

604
00:30:18.661 --> 00:30:23.280
<v Speaker 3>thirties when I started reading books</v>
<v Speaker 3>about Buddhism and all the things we</v>

605
00:30:23.281 --> 00:30:26.430
<v Speaker 3>want the most calm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>patience,</v>

606
00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:27.840
<v Speaker 3>compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>generosity,</v>

607
00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:29.820
<v Speaker 3>happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever that means.</v>

608
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:33.120
<v Speaker 3>These are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these aren't factory settings,</v>

609
00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:37.050
<v Speaker 3>non negotiable factory settings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are skills that can be trained</v>

610
00:30:37.051 --> 00:30:40.320
<v Speaker 3>that you can take responsibility for</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the way you take responsibility for</v>

611
00:30:40.321 --> 00:30:43.050
<v Speaker 3>your body in the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there are lots of ways to train</v>

612
00:30:43.051 --> 00:30:43.331
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

613
00:30:43.331 --> 00:30:45.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeff and I obviously talk a lot about</v>

614
00:30:45.271 --> 00:30:46.104
<v Speaker 3>meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

615
00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:47.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

616
00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:51.600
<v Speaker 3>you've talked about other ways to do it</v>
<v Speaker 3>as well from martial arts too,</v>

617
00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.840
<v Speaker 3>and there's now been a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a growing body of research about</v>

618
00:30:54.841 --> 00:30:56.290
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

619
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:58.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was obvious to me from being in the</v>

620
00:30:58.171 --> 00:31:00.990
<v Speaker 3>isolation from the sensory deprivation</v>
<v Speaker 3>tank that,</v>

621
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:04.380
<v Speaker 3>that is a training too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are lots of ways to get at it,</v>

622
00:31:04.381 --> 00:31:08.550
<v Speaker 3>but the fundamental good news is you</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't stuck with the patterns that are</v>

623
00:31:08.551 --> 00:31:09.450
<v Speaker 3>making you miserable.</v>

624
00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:10.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not,</v>

625
00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:12.250
<v Speaker 4>you're definitely not stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

626
00:31:12.251 --> 00:31:14.050
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that all of these things are</v>

627
00:31:14.051 --> 00:31:18.520
<v Speaker 4>related and I think that even running,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even a exercise,</v>

628
00:31:18.521 --> 00:31:22.630
<v Speaker 4>yoga in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these things that are difficult when</v>

629
00:31:22.631 --> 00:31:26.990
<v Speaker 4>you do these difficult things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're stressing your mind or I should</v>

630
00:31:26.991 --> 00:31:28.240
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't be stressing your mind,</v>

631
00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:33.960
<v Speaker 4>exercising your mind and exercising your</v>
<v Speaker 4>body's ability to manage intense</v>

632
00:31:34.511 --> 00:31:37.390
<v Speaker 4>situations like yoga poses a very</v>
<v Speaker 4>intense,</v>

633
00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:39.250
<v Speaker 4>especially hot yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard.</v>

634
00:31:39.251 --> 00:31:43.180
<v Speaker 4>It's very difficult to very testing and</v>
<v Speaker 4>in doing so you,</v>

635
00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:47.120
<v Speaker 4>you lessen the stress of regular life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

636
00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.180
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

637
00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:50.190
<v Speaker 4>you're tied up in a reef knot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

638
00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:54.010
<v Speaker 4>you can be economists with this</v>
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous pose where you're shaking</v>

639
00:31:54.011 --> 00:31:57.010
<v Speaker 4>with exertion than how much more</v>
<v Speaker 4>economists can you be.</v>

640
00:31:57.011 --> 00:31:58.930
<v Speaker 4>How much more present and open can you</v>
<v Speaker 4>be in your life.</v>

641
00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:00.790
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think most people</v>

642
00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:04.780
<v Speaker 3>bill how to translate what they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>learning in something like.</v>

643
00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:09.940
<v Speaker 3>So for me that was what broke through</v>
<v Speaker 3>about meditation was it was so obvious</v>

644
00:32:10.151 --> 00:32:14.140
<v Speaker 3>how to translate what I was learning</v>
<v Speaker 3>with my eyes closed to my life.</v>

645
00:32:14.141 --> 00:32:16.690
<v Speaker 3>Whereas all the other things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

646
00:32:16.691 --> 00:32:18.760
<v Speaker 3>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had been running since I was in my</v>

647
00:32:18.761 --> 00:32:20.090
<v Speaker 3>teens and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and while I,</v>

648
00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:22.510
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's absolutely good at staving off</v>

649
00:32:22.511 --> 00:32:24.220
<v Speaker 3>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I've dealt with for a long time</v>

650
00:32:24.221 --> 00:32:25.031
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

651
00:32:25.031 --> 00:32:28.570
<v Speaker 3>and making me feel just generally fit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

652
00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:33.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that I was explicitly</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking the lessons of running or any of</v>

653
00:32:33.101 --> 00:32:35.920
<v Speaker 3>the other things that many people do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they sometimes refer to as their</v>

654
00:32:35.921 --> 00:32:38.650
<v Speaker 3>quote unquote meditation now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And applying it to my life.</v>

655
00:32:38.651 --> 00:32:41.270
<v Speaker 3>The way was against so obvious.</v>

656
00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seemed like the obvious aspects of</v>

657
00:32:43.181 --> 00:32:45.340
<v Speaker 2>meditation are conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're,</v>

658
00:32:45.341 --> 00:32:48.160
<v Speaker 2>you're looking for these solutions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas with running,</v>

659
00:32:48.161 --> 00:32:51.370
<v Speaker 2>you might be getting them without being</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious of them or at least getting</v>

660
00:32:51.371 --> 00:32:53.500
<v Speaker 2>some of the benefits of it without being</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious,</v>

661
00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:57.490
<v Speaker 2>but those benefits would certainly be</v>
<v Speaker 2>enhanced with a different perspective</v>

662
00:32:57.491 --> 00:33:00.370
<v Speaker 2>going into the running,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like going into the running with the</v>

663
00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:05.260
<v Speaker 2>thought process of testing your</v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness to endure this a very</v>

664
00:33:05.261 --> 00:33:08.140
<v Speaker 2>difficult thing in front of you like</v>
<v Speaker 2>hill running in particular.</v>

665
00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:09.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

666
00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:13.570
<v Speaker 2>there's something about anything that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like very uniquely physically stressful</v>

667
00:33:13.571 --> 00:33:16.480
<v Speaker 2>like that which requires the mind to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay the course.</v>

668
00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:18.760
<v Speaker 2>And in doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in the other end,</v>

669
00:33:18.761 --> 00:33:22.060
<v Speaker 2>once you come out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this great feeling of euphoria</v>

670
00:33:22.061 --> 00:33:25.420
<v Speaker 2>and peace and it's not just a physical</v>
<v Speaker 2>release of energy,</v>

671
00:33:25.421 --> 00:33:29.920
<v Speaker 2>but it's also an understanding that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain has exercised the demons that are</v>

672
00:33:29.921 --> 00:33:33.100
<v Speaker 2>responsible for the anxiety while you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>overcoming this stressful</v>

673
00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:35.280
<v Speaker 3>and the limits you told yourself were</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

674
00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:36.271
<v Speaker 3>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

675
00:33:36.271 --> 00:33:36.900
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

676
00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:39.180
<v Speaker 3>my wife and I've been doing a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>soul cycle,</v>

677
00:33:39.181 --> 00:33:42.460
<v Speaker 3>which I know my wife does it too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't,</v>

678
00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:44.340
<v Speaker 3>you don't do it with her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

679
00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:45.980
<v Speaker 1>I have other shit to do because I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

680
00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:47.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm a better husband and Joe Rogan,</v>

681
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:50.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so although in my,</v>

682
00:33:50.961 --> 00:33:52.700
<v Speaker 3>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's out in the green room right now</v>

683
00:33:52.701 --> 00:33:56.390
<v Speaker 3>raging against me because she's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's angry because that I'm not at soul</v>

684
00:33:56.391 --> 00:33:58.760
<v Speaker 3>cycle right now that I haven't said what</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm about to say,</v>

685
00:33:58.761 --> 00:34:00.560
<v Speaker 3>which is that I'm the one who got her</v>
<v Speaker 3>into it,</v>

686
00:34:00.561 --> 00:34:02.330
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so in her defense.</v>

687
00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:05.450
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they are often giving these,</v>

688
00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:10.710
<v Speaker 3>the teachers are often giving these</v>
<v Speaker 3>really sort of affirmations from the</v>

689
00:34:11.031 --> 00:34:13.520
<v Speaker 3>front of the room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

690
00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:18.730
<v Speaker 3>my traditional approach to those is to</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely ignore them as incredibly and</v>

691
00:34:19.041 --> 00:34:22.520
<v Speaker 3>irretrievably annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And however,</v>

692
00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:24.740
<v Speaker 3>what they're saying is what you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

693
00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:27.680
<v Speaker 3>what they're saying is pedal through</v>
<v Speaker 3>your resistance,</v>

694
00:34:27.681 --> 00:34:31.250
<v Speaker 3>your telling yourself a story that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't turn the knob up to the right</v>

695
00:34:31.251 --> 00:34:33.020
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the resistance knob to the right right</v>

696
00:34:33.021 --> 00:34:35.990
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and stay on the beat and sprint and do</v>

697
00:34:35.991 --> 00:34:37.370
<v Speaker 3>all the Greek.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're telling yourself a story.</v>

698
00:34:37.371 --> 00:34:39.080
<v Speaker 3>You can't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you actually can do it.</v>

699
00:34:39.081 --> 00:34:43.010
<v Speaker 3>Try it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Try it to get over the limiting stories</v>

700
00:34:43.011 --> 00:34:44.630
<v Speaker 3>you're telling yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in fact,</v>

701
00:34:44.631 --> 00:34:46.820
<v Speaker 3>yesterday morning when we did soul</v>
<v Speaker 3>cycle,</v>

702
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.430
<v Speaker 3>that guy at the end said something I</v>
<v Speaker 3>normally would have ignored,</v>

703
00:34:49.431 --> 00:34:53.870
<v Speaker 3>which was next time somebody proposes</v>
<v Speaker 3>something to you that you tell yourself</v>

704
00:34:53.871 --> 00:34:55.580
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>

705
00:34:56.270 --> 00:35:01.270
<v Speaker 3>Hence the sensory deprivation tank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Direct link to what he said to my being</v>

706
00:35:03.471 --> 00:35:05.510
<v Speaker 3>willing to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's some there,</v>

707
00:35:05.511 --> 00:35:05.720
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

708
00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:08.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about things like soul</v>

709
00:35:08.061 --> 00:35:09.850
<v Speaker 1>cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if the right.</v>

710
00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Even if the motivational speech rings</v>
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>

711
00:35:13.131 --> 00:35:14.240
<v Speaker 1>you want to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

712
00:35:14.241 --> 00:35:17.990
<v Speaker 1>this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the problem with spiritual teachers,</v>

713
00:35:17.991 --> 00:35:20.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a problem with somebody who's,</v>

714
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:22.520
<v Speaker 1>or anybody who walks around that it has</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer.</v>

715
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:24.410
<v Speaker 1>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's an.</v>

716
00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:27.920
<v Speaker 1>And often the answer can be this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>pollyanna ish,</v>

717
00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:32.570
<v Speaker 1>a Disney channel thing that may,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it probably is true on some way,</v>

718
00:35:32.571 --> 00:35:35.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's just the delivery of that kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of certainty.</v>

719
00:35:35.601 --> 00:35:36.850
<v Speaker 1>That's so annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

720
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.033
<v Speaker 3>say that my,</v>

721
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.540
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

722
00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:41.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are millions of meditation books.</v>

723
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:46.920
<v Speaker 2>The only thing new about the books that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I write is that I add the word fuck a</v>

724
00:35:46.921 --> 00:35:47.970
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

725
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:49.550
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is a,</v>

726
00:35:49.551 --> 00:35:51.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a new way to talk about this stuff</v>

727
00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:54.120
<v Speaker 2>because our tendency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or at least guys like us,</v>

728
00:35:54.121 --> 00:35:56.760
<v Speaker 2>I think where people like us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men and women like us,</v>

729
00:35:56.970 --> 00:36:01.970
<v Speaker 2>is to some people when you hear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you hear this kind of affirmation</v>

730
00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:05.180
<v Speaker 2>uttered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you reflectively rejected,</v>

731
00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:08.880
<v Speaker 2>which is again normal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you can just say it to people and</v>

732
00:36:08.881 --> 00:36:11.760
<v Speaker 2>fresh language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the reason why these things are</v>

733
00:36:11.761 --> 00:36:15.090
<v Speaker 2>cliched,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is because they're true and they become</v>

734
00:36:15.091 --> 00:36:17.610
<v Speaker 2>cliche through sort of mindless</v>
<v Speaker 2>repetition.</v>

735
00:36:17.611 --> 00:36:19.320
<v Speaker 2>But if you can find new ways to</v>
<v Speaker 2>articulate them,</v>

736
00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:23.850
<v Speaker 2>they can land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think also whether it's your book on</v>

737
00:36:23.851 --> 00:36:26.970
<v Speaker 2>meditation or anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just life experiences that they're,</v>

738
00:36:26.971 --> 00:36:31.770
<v Speaker 2>they're writing down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We gather information from other</v>

739
00:36:31.771 --> 00:36:34.710
<v Speaker 2>people's life experiences in a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>unique way.</v>

740
00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:38.070
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the reasons why people</v>
<v Speaker 2>really enjoy autobiographies.</v>

741
00:36:38.071 --> 00:36:40.260
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the reasons why people</v>
<v Speaker 2>really enjoy,</v>

742
00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:45.580
<v Speaker 2>just truly reflective introspective</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking because we,</v>

743
00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:51.170
<v Speaker 2>we can pick out little gems in our self.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even though you might be talking in</v>

744
00:36:51.811 --> 00:36:54.450
<v Speaker 2>your meditation book about things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people have talked about in</v>

745
00:36:54.451 --> 00:36:57.000
<v Speaker 2>meditation books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about it from your unique</v>

746
00:36:57.001 --> 00:37:00.930
<v Speaker 2>personal experience and when someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>reads that or here's you say it,</v>

747
00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:04.020
<v Speaker 2>you get something tangible out of that.</v>

748
00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:04.680
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

749
00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.410
<v Speaker 3>we talk a lot about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

750
00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:11.470
<v Speaker 3>so my favorite comedian of all time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other than Joe Rogan is Dave Chappelle.</v>

751
00:37:11.471 --> 00:37:12.360
<v Speaker 3>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

752
00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:15.370
<v Speaker 3>you came on my radar screen because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>were on a show,</v>

753
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:17.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Chappelle show back in the and the</v>

754
00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:20.050
<v Speaker 3>fear factor bit he did years and years</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago,</v>

755
00:37:20.051 --> 00:37:24.580
<v Speaker 3>which was one of the funniest things</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've ever seen a and Chappelle in one of</v>

756
00:37:24.581 --> 00:37:26.920
<v Speaker 3>the seasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeff and I were talking about this last</v>

757
00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.600
<v Speaker 3>night as a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talked about,</v>

758
00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:32.410
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how he was doing one of these outtake</v>

759
00:37:32.411 --> 00:37:34.180
<v Speaker 3>episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember which season was in</v>

760
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:37.750
<v Speaker 3>because they only did two and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was doing an outtake episode and at</v>

761
00:37:37.751 --> 00:37:41.950
<v Speaker 3>the beginning he did a riff about how</v>
<v Speaker 3>back in the day African American</v>

762
00:37:41.951 --> 00:37:44.830
<v Speaker 3>communities never got the good part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pig to eat.</v>

763
00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:46.750
<v Speaker 3>The white people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got the good parts of the pig,</v>

764
00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:47.920
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

765
00:37:47.921 --> 00:37:52.921
<v Speaker 3>the African Americans had to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to make good food out of snout and</v>

766
00:37:53.171 --> 00:37:55.480
<v Speaker 3>that's he said what this episode is</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be,</v>

767
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:58.030
<v Speaker 3>we're going to take the snout and we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to make good stuff out of it.</v>

768
00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:01.900
<v Speaker 3>And my approach to writing books about</v>
<v Speaker 3>meditation is the snout is the good</v>

769
00:38:01.901 --> 00:38:03.940
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The embarrassing shit that happens to</v>

770
00:38:03.941 --> 00:38:06.460
<v Speaker 3>you when you were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're meditating is the good</v>

771
00:38:06.461 --> 00:38:09.310
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is what will allow people to see what</v>

772
00:38:09.311 --> 00:38:11.740
<v Speaker 3>the practice does for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I take the worst,</v>

773
00:38:11.741 --> 00:38:15.910
<v Speaker 3>most embarrassing stuff that happens and</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about it because that is gives you</v>

774
00:38:15.911 --> 00:38:19.480
<v Speaker 3>a front row seat at what training the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mind actually looks like.</v>

775
00:38:19.481 --> 00:38:22.300
<v Speaker 3>And if you can't have a sense of humor</v>
<v Speaker 3>about how crazy you are,</v>

776
00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.940
<v Speaker 3>you are truly fucked.</v>

777
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:30.150
<v Speaker 2>I think that those uncomfortable moments</v>
<v Speaker 2>are so important for other people to</v>

778
00:38:30.151 --> 00:38:30.984
<v Speaker 2>hear about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

779
00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:32.550
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

780
00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:34.980
<v Speaker 2>We need to know we're not alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

781
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:36.130
<v Speaker 2>All our madness.</v>

782
00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:38.290
<v Speaker 4>What was it like on the set when you</v>
<v Speaker 4>were working with Dave Chappelle?</v>

783
00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:39.580
<v Speaker 4>It was great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

784
00:38:39.581 --> 00:38:42.610
<v Speaker 4>I've known Dan for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was actually on the very first episode</v>

785
00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:47.850
<v Speaker 4>we by chance I was walking through New</v>
<v Speaker 4>York and I saw dave and this was before</v>

786
00:38:48.581 --> 00:38:50.170
<v Speaker 4>the show had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even Beth.</v>

787
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:53.690
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even know it existed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I rented a Bobcat Goldthwait who's</v>

788
00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:55.050
<v Speaker 4>there and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's up man?</v>

<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>

790
00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:56.741
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>And I go,</v>

793
00:39:01.241 --> 00:39:03.370
<v Speaker 4>I only have like 20 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm on my way to a meeting.</v>

794
00:39:03.371 --> 00:39:04.540
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here he goes,</v>

795
00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:07.840
<v Speaker 4>we're handing out Britain's for New York</v>
<v Speaker 4>boobs,</v>

796
00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:09.970
<v Speaker 4>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a box,</v>

797
00:39:09.971 --> 00:39:14.110
<v Speaker 4>so it's me and him walking through</v>
<v Speaker 4>Manhattan and he's got this crazy fake</v>

798
00:39:14.111 --> 00:39:17.350
<v Speaker 4>mustache on and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got the best New York boobs,</v>

799
00:39:17.351 --> 00:39:19.210
<v Speaker 4>and he would give someone like a ribbon</v>
<v Speaker 4>for heaven,</v>

800
00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:19.960
<v Speaker 4>New York boobs.</v>

801
00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:23.080
<v Speaker 4>And it was really silly but fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I was like,</v>

802
00:39:23.081 --> 00:39:24.190
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dave's got a show.</v>

803
00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:28.390
<v Speaker 4>And then turns out it's the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 4>sketch show in the history of the world.</v>

804
00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:33.720
<v Speaker 4>And a year later he calls me up again</v>
<v Speaker 4>and asked me to do this thing for.</v>

805
00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:36.160
<v Speaker 4>They wanted to do a fear factor sketch</v>
<v Speaker 4>with tyrone Brigham's.</v>

806
00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:37.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's me and him.</v>

807
00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:39.850
<v Speaker 4>A fresh faced Joe Rogan and Dave</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chappelle.</v>

808
00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:40.703
<v Speaker 4>The.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

809
00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:42.290
<v Speaker 4>Well this is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What year is it?</v>

810
00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:43.763
<v Speaker 4>Three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Four.</v>

811
00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:45.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's before that.</v>

812
00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:47.590
<v Speaker 4>Is it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's before that.</v>

813
00:39:47.591 --> 00:39:50.110
<v Speaker 4>I want to say it's 2002 maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

814
00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:50.950
<v Speaker 4>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

815
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:54.760
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't even doing the mantra back then</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was doing that in 2003.</v>

816
00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:57.070
<v Speaker 4>So I think it's 2002.</v>

817
00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:00.940
<v Speaker 3>The fear factor bit is one of my</v>
<v Speaker 3>favorite season two,</v>

818
00:40:00.941 --> 00:40:01.870
<v Speaker 3>if I recall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so,</v>

819
00:40:01.871 --> 00:40:04.150
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And is really one of the,</v>

820
00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:08.110
<v Speaker 3>at one of the funniest bits in a show</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>

821
00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:11.830
<v Speaker 3>I would argue perhaps the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 3>television show of all time.</v>

822
00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:14.770
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the greatest sketch comedy</v>
<v Speaker 3>show of all time.</v>

823
00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:16.413
<v Speaker 3>Something bigger.</v>

824
00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:20.770
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to say that though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because if you boiled down a lot of the</v>

825
00:40:20.771 --> 00:40:23.470
<v Speaker 4>all time great shows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in living color or some of the</v>

826
00:40:23.471 --> 00:40:24.390
<v Speaker 4>other ones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boy,</v>

827
00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:27.850
<v Speaker 4>they had so many seasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you boiled them down to two seasons,</v>

828
00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:32.250
<v Speaker 4>maybe there will be some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's got some sketches that worst</v>

829
00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:36.250
<v Speaker 4>just groundbreaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the black white supremacist who was</v>

830
00:40:36.251 --> 00:40:37.084
<v Speaker 4>blind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

831
00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:41.160
<v Speaker 3>What about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was watching last night because jeff</v>

832
00:40:41.161 --> 00:40:42.480
<v Speaker 3>and I were talking about Chicago last</v>
<v Speaker 3>night,</v>

833
00:40:42.481 --> 00:40:44.940
<v Speaker 3>so on the car ride home from this event</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did together,</v>

834
00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:49.180
<v Speaker 3>I was watching black Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was another I think unbelievably,</v>

835
00:40:49.181 --> 00:40:53.190
<v Speaker 3>which released season two where he plays</v>
<v Speaker 3>George w dot Bush,</v>

836
00:40:53.191 --> 00:40:57.450
<v Speaker 3>his version of Georgia and all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>rationales for going into the war in</v>

837
00:40:57.451 --> 00:40:59.790
<v Speaker 3>Iraq and it's unbelievably funny.</v>

838
00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:01.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a genius.</v>

839
00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:05.000
<v Speaker 4>He's a real comedy genius,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also a guy who's.</v>

840
00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:09.380
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't get it if you just sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>see him do standup,</v>

841
00:41:09.381 --> 00:41:13.370
<v Speaker 4>but he's deeply introspective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like very intensely.</v>

842
00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:15.710
<v Speaker 4>Well thought out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know he's not.</v>

843
00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:19.880
<v Speaker 4>He's not a surface guy by any stretch of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the imagination.</v>

844
00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:22.790
<v Speaker 3>I love them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>

845
00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:25.610
<v Speaker 3>I keep thinking that show's going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>come back at some point.</v>

846
00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:26.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure</v>

847
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.770
<v Speaker 4>his is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Netflix specials are better.</v>

848
00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:33.810
<v Speaker 4>I've seen him unfucked with in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unless Netflix let them do a Chappelle</v>

849
00:41:34.311 --> 00:41:37.010
<v Speaker 4>show where they just left him alone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then it will be genius,</v>

850
00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.770
<v Speaker 4>but that was the problem in season three</v>
<v Speaker 4>set.</v>

851
00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:41.420
<v Speaker 4>I know it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was.</v>

852
00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:44.750
<v Speaker 4>They were telling him what to say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were telling them there is so much</v>

853
00:41:44.751 --> 00:41:49.040
<v Speaker 4>money involved that they were trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get him to slightly watered down his</v>

854
00:41:49.041 --> 00:41:52.010
<v Speaker 4>content in order to make it more</v>
<v Speaker 4>palatable for advertisers.</v>

855
00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:54.800
<v Speaker 4>They were asking him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does not say the n word.</v>

856
00:41:55.250 --> 00:42:00.250
<v Speaker 4>There was a lot of behind the scenes</v>
<v Speaker 4>nonsense that I dealt with the exact</v>

857
00:42:00.891 --> 00:42:04.730
<v Speaker 4>same administration and comedy central,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm well aware of how silly they were</v>

858
00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:08.180
<v Speaker 4>about certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had these corporate ideas and this</v>

859
00:42:08.181 --> 00:42:12.010
<v Speaker 4>was also right around the same time</v>
<v Speaker 4>Janet Jackson's nipple popped out there</v>

860
00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:14.660
<v Speaker 4>in the street ball,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which fucking oddly enough,</v>

861
00:42:14.661 --> 00:42:15.740
<v Speaker 4>changed everything.</v>

862
00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:19.640
<v Speaker 4>People started freaking out about</v>
<v Speaker 4>content because of a nipple.</v>

863
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:20.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was.</v>

864
00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:23.420
<v Speaker 4>It was very.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a very weird time for television</v>

865
00:42:23.421 --> 00:42:28.220
<v Speaker 4>and in their defense what they do is</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're producers.</v>

866
00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:30.320
<v Speaker 4>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not creative people.</v>

867
00:42:30.321 --> 00:42:35.321
<v Speaker 4>They're executives and they didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 4>how to handle how to keep it funny and</v>

868
00:42:37.341 --> 00:42:41.420
<v Speaker 4>keep it free and loose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also figuring out a way to make it</v>

869
00:42:41.421 --> 00:42:44.360
<v Speaker 4>fit into what their corporate structure</v>
<v Speaker 4>is of what's acceptable and not</v>

870
00:42:44.361 --> 00:42:48.380
<v Speaker 4>acceptable for advertising.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was just a clusterfuck of control</v>

871
00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:53.560
<v Speaker 4>and neediness and too many cooks in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>kitchen and people's ego where there's a</v>

872
00:42:53.691 --> 00:42:57.680
<v Speaker 4>lot of people that just want it to</v>
<v Speaker 4>affect the show just so that they can</v>

873
00:42:57.681 --> 00:43:01.280
<v Speaker 4>put their greasy fingerprints on it and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a really common thing with</v>

874
00:43:01.281 --> 00:43:04.400
<v Speaker 4>television that that ego aspect of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

875
00:43:04.401 --> 00:43:09.401
<v Speaker 4>these different people who are high up</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the food chain in the executive world</v>

876
00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:13.940
<v Speaker 4>wanting to put their stamp on a show and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then talking openly about putting their</v>

877
00:43:13.941 --> 00:43:14.270
<v Speaker 4>stamp.</v>

878
00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:15.230
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was my idea.</v>

879
00:43:15.231 --> 00:43:18.980
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was really important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We get dave out there like that and it</v>

880
00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:19.701
<v Speaker 4>for him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>

881
00:43:19.701 --> 00:43:21.980
<v Speaker 4>fuck this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to Africa for a couple months</v>

882
00:43:21.981 --> 00:43:23.630
<v Speaker 4>and I'm just going to come back and</v>
<v Speaker 4>quit.</v>

883
00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:25.640
<v Speaker 4>And everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

884
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:28.040
<v Speaker 4>But that's who David is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

885
00:43:28.041 --> 00:43:28.874
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>

886
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.040
<v Speaker 4>There's not a lot of people that walk</v>
<v Speaker 4>away from $50,</v>

887
00:43:31.041 --> 00:43:33.050
<v Speaker 4>million dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's one of them.</v>

888
00:43:33.051 --> 00:43:35.120
<v Speaker 4>He's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't need to do this.</v>

889
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:36.440
<v Speaker 4>I could.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could do something else.</v>

890
00:43:36.441 --> 00:43:40.190
<v Speaker 4>I just do stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he in fact we even weirder,</v>

891
00:43:40.191 --> 00:43:43.130
<v Speaker 4>he didn't do standup for a long time and</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he did it,</v>

892
00:43:43.131 --> 00:43:46.340
<v Speaker 4>he did it for free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would just show up places like he</v>

893
00:43:46.341 --> 00:43:50.510
<v Speaker 4>would show up places with a speaker and</v>
<v Speaker 4>plug it into a microphone and a park in</v>

894
00:43:50.511 --> 00:43:52.460
<v Speaker 4>Seattle and just start doing standup.</v>

895
00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:55.760
<v Speaker 4>There was a lot of stories about like</v>
<v Speaker 4>people would just gather around hundreds</v>

896
00:43:55.761 --> 00:44:00.170
<v Speaker 4>of people and he would just be doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>standup for these random people and they</v>

897
00:44:00.171 --> 00:44:01.100
<v Speaker 4>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going on?</v>

898
00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:04.490
<v Speaker 4>How does a guy get to be like that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just be yourself.</v>

899
00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:06.040
<v Speaker 4>That's who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But was that you think,</v>

900
00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:08.270
<v Speaker 4>is that something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean because that sounds to me like</v>

901
00:44:08.271 --> 00:44:12.410
<v Speaker 4>somebody who had a practice or something</v>
<v Speaker 4>or like or an inner compass that was</v>

902
00:44:12.411 --> 00:44:15.010
<v Speaker 4>smoked a lot of weed that maybe that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of it.</v>

903
00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:19.750
<v Speaker 4>He smokes weed all day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you watch this new netflix</v>

904
00:44:19.751 --> 00:44:23.600
<v Speaker 4>specially smoking a vape pen through the</v>
<v Speaker 4>entire special to the point where I</v>

905
00:44:23.601 --> 00:44:25.550
<v Speaker 4>watched it in like 40 minutes of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>special.</v>

906
00:44:25.551 --> 00:44:26.840
<v Speaker 4>I started getting anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

907
00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:28.670
<v Speaker 4>how high are you right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man?</v>

908
00:44:28.671 --> 00:44:30.920
<v Speaker 4>When you said you might,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will you hide your Netflix?</v>

909
00:44:30.921 --> 00:44:32.160
<v Speaker 4>But yeah.</v>

910
00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:34.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you said at the beginning you</v>

911
00:44:34.231 --> 00:44:35.580
<v Speaker 3>were baked and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that a bit or is it.</v>

912
00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:37.970
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was high but I didn't keep getting</v>

913
00:44:37.971 --> 00:44:41.330
<v Speaker 4>high through this special.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Dave keeps hitting that vape pen</v>

914
00:44:41.331 --> 00:44:43.040
<v Speaker 4>and I don't know how strong that vape</v>
<v Speaker 4>pen is,</v>

915
00:44:43.041 --> 00:44:44.600
<v Speaker 4>but he's like seven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eight,</v>

916
00:44:44.601 --> 00:44:47.620
<v Speaker 4>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 hits deep in 40 minutes in.</v>

917
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:48.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yo,</v>

918
00:44:48.711 --> 00:44:51.230
<v Speaker 4>this kid gets super slippery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

919
00:44:51.231 --> 00:44:55.880
<v Speaker 4>He just kept pulling out this vape pen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

920
00:44:56.020 --> 00:45:00.290
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was literally with him through</v>
<v Speaker 4>the entire set in his hand.</v>

921
00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:04.690
<v Speaker 3>That's increasing the degree of</v>
<v Speaker 3>difficulty to this that I would not want</v>

922
00:45:04.691 --> 00:45:07.930
<v Speaker 3>to explore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what an isolation tank.</v>

923
00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:08.741
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

924
00:45:08.741 --> 00:45:09.540
<v Speaker 3>That's a.</v>

925
00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:12.510
<v Speaker 4>But it also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's freeing in a way because you're so</v>

926
00:45:12.511 --> 00:45:15.800
<v Speaker 4>comfortable that experience of like</v>
<v Speaker 4>giving into the,</v>

927
00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:17.940
<v Speaker 4>to the marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like giving into the,</v>

928
00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:20.940
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thc where you just sort of like</v>

929
00:45:20.941 --> 00:45:23.690
<v Speaker 4>float away on it and don't question it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

930
00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:26.560
<v Speaker 3>But as you were high backstage getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>ready to do your netflix special and I</v>

931
00:45:26.561 --> 00:45:29.260
<v Speaker 3>would imagine that's a pretty stressful</v>
<v Speaker 3>environment because they're taping this</v>

932
00:45:29.261 --> 00:45:30.910
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be your special.</v>

933
00:45:30.911 --> 00:45:33.760
<v Speaker 3>It's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you not have a moment of like,</v>

934
00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:35.860
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit I shouldn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't have smoked?</v>

935
00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.240
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

936
00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:38.380
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fun.</v>

937
00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:43.510
<v Speaker 4>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is like an incredibly privileged</v>

938
00:45:43.511 --> 00:45:46.240
<v Speaker 4>position.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I find myself in like this whole thing</v>

939
00:45:46.241 --> 00:45:48.790
<v Speaker 4>is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So crazy wild ride.</v>

940
00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:54.060
<v Speaker 4>So I'm about to do the wildest part of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wild ride film a Netflix special and</v>

941
00:45:54.341 --> 00:45:55.240
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

942
00:45:55.241 --> 00:45:56.140
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just joy,</v>

943
00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:58.840
<v Speaker 4>just taking it all in and then going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is so like,</v>

944
00:45:58.841 --> 00:46:03.100
<v Speaker 4>all the hard work is done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The materials in place,</v>

945
00:46:03.101 --> 00:46:06.120
<v Speaker 4>the writing has been done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the rehearsals been done,</v>

946
00:46:06.121 --> 00:46:10.180
<v Speaker 4>has been hundreds and hundreds of sets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything's tightened up and all the</v>

947
00:46:10.181 --> 00:46:13.300
<v Speaker 4>notes are in place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I've run it 100 times.</v>

948
00:46:13.301 --> 00:46:17.150
<v Speaker 4>And by the time you saw the film,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Netflix special,</v>

949
00:46:17.151 --> 00:46:21.770
<v Speaker 4>it was mostly the fourth show of for</v>
<v Speaker 4>taping.</v>

950
00:46:21.850 --> 00:46:25.810
<v Speaker 4>So I've already taped three taping so</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've already got it in the can.</v>

951
00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:28.720
<v Speaker 4>So there's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most of the pressure is off so it's just</v>

952
00:46:28.721 --> 00:46:29.850
<v Speaker 4>like a regular show on.</v>

953
00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:31.510
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

954
00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:34.690
<v Speaker 4>So it's just just happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just let it,</v>

955
00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:37.990
<v Speaker 4>let it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you seem happy while watching it.</v>

956
00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:39.490
<v Speaker 4>It was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

957
00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:43.300
<v Speaker 4>it's a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's one of those weird things where</v>

958
00:46:44.170 --> 00:46:46.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stand up,</v>

959
00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:51.040
<v Speaker 4>live standup is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is weird itself because you know you're</v>

960
00:46:51.041 --> 00:46:55.270
<v Speaker 4>dealing with all these factors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people's consciousness.</v>

961
00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:58.210
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to manage your material as</v>

962
00:46:58.211 --> 00:47:02.030
<v Speaker 4>well as bring them in and make sure that</v>
<v Speaker 4>your timing is right and everything is</v>

963
00:47:02.031 --> 00:47:05.350
<v Speaker 4>smooth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then on top of that there's the</v>

964
00:47:05.351 --> 00:47:10.351
<v Speaker 4>filming aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this will be locked in and recorded</v>

965
00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:12.490
<v Speaker 4>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this is,</v>

966
00:47:12.491 --> 00:47:16.540
<v Speaker 4>this is going to go online and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>people will have copies of it and then</v>

967
00:47:16.541 --> 00:47:18.580
<v Speaker 4>it will be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

968
00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:21.220
<v Speaker 4>this is your material,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is your thought process.</v>

969
00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:26.260
<v Speaker 4>Do you have this iron down?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you have this edited and parsed and</v>

970
00:47:26.261 --> 00:47:29.050
<v Speaker 4>sectioned and have you thoroughly</v>
<v Speaker 4>examined?</v>

971
00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 4>Have you used</v>

972
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.110
<v Speaker 1>the correct economy of words?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you.</v>

973
00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:36.160
<v Speaker 1>Have you boiled it down into the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible version of itself?</v>

974
00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:39.280
<v Speaker 3>So funny with standup because you watch</v>
<v Speaker 3>it as a as A.</v>

975
00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:42.160
<v Speaker 3>Because I've never done standup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You watch it as a consumer.</v>

976
00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:44.650
<v Speaker 3>It looks casual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks off the cuff,</v>

977
00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:47.230
<v Speaker 3>it has enormous amount of work that goes</v>
<v Speaker 3>into it,</v>

978
00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:52.320
<v Speaker 1>but it's both casual and off the cuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>and incredibly well thought out and</v>

979
00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:56.770
<v Speaker 1>rehearsed and it has to be both of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things but don't you have to.</v>

980
00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:59.200
<v Speaker 1>So you prepare like crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you got that,</v>

981
00:47:59.201 --> 00:48:02.650
<v Speaker 1>but then when you're actually there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't there a certain amount of having</v>

982
00:48:02.651 --> 00:48:06.130
<v Speaker 1>to let go and try and be actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsive to what's happening in the</v>

983
00:48:06.131 --> 00:48:08.620
<v Speaker 1>audience to a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That must be the skill.</v>

984
00:48:08.621 --> 00:48:10.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like you do the preparation so you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can almost let go of.</v>

985
00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:12.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this both,</v>

986
00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:14.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you have to be prepared but you</v>

987
00:48:14.201 --> 00:48:19.201
<v Speaker 1>also have to be loose and you have to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely engrossed in what you're</v>

988
00:48:20.501 --> 00:48:22.330
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also in the moment.</v>

989
00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:23.283
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

990
00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:24.610
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tricky,</v>

991
00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:29.320
<v Speaker 1>but the bottom line is when it's done</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worth it.</v>

992
00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:33.160
<v Speaker 1>Like all the weirdness of like when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it done or something like triggered.</v>

993
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:34.720
<v Speaker 1>When it was done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I finished it.</v>

994
00:48:34.721 --> 00:48:35.650
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it.</v>

995
00:48:36.010 --> 00:48:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Like this is what I wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I wanted to,</v>

996
00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:43.740
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to accurately represent a real</v>
<v Speaker 1>live standup comedy set that feels like</v>

997
00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:49.030
<v Speaker 1>any other set that you could catch me in</v>
<v Speaker 1>San Francisco on a Saturday night.</v>

998
00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:51.970
<v Speaker 1>And so it was that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's all worth it.</v>

999
00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:53.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it felt like that.</v>

1000
00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:56.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I waited about a year,</v>

1001
00:48:56.350 --> 00:48:58.690
<v Speaker 1>then I start doing it again and now I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the process.</v>

1002
00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:00.980
<v Speaker 1>A couple more months I'll do it again</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1003
00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:04.990
<v Speaker 1>It sounds a lot like actually the</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of teaching you're teaching</v>

1004
00:49:04.991 --> 00:49:06.940
<v Speaker 1>meditation sort of like because you got</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>

1005
00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:10.750
<v Speaker 1>you kind of got to know you have to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced and sort of know your stuff,</v>

1006
00:49:10.751 --> 00:49:13.870
<v Speaker 1>but the other hand you actually got to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be super open to exactly what's coming</v>

1007
00:49:13.871 --> 00:49:17.650
<v Speaker 1>up and what someone's describing or</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening and you've got to be.</v>

1008
00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:19.960
<v Speaker 1>And so if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you try to bear down too hard on</v>

1009
00:49:19.961 --> 00:49:22.150
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're just going to be repeating</v>

1010
00:49:22.151 --> 00:49:25.140
<v Speaker 1>your own shit back again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So can you be a.</v>

1011
00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:28.660
<v Speaker 1>had that total openness to actually see</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is that someone is saying and</v>

1012
00:49:28.661 --> 00:49:30.880
<v Speaker 1>not have not have your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put your projections on it,</v>

1013
00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:34.390
<v Speaker 1>but you have to have also done your</v>
<v Speaker 1>homework in a way and it's just having</v>

1014
00:49:34.391 --> 00:49:37.900
<v Speaker 1>that balance and then there's that</v>
<v Speaker 1>really this beautiful thing where you're</v>

1015
00:49:37.901 --> 00:49:40.120
<v Speaker 1>kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get into flow when you're kind of in</v>

1016
00:49:40.121 --> 00:49:45.100
<v Speaker 1>the zone and it just like you hardly</v>
<v Speaker 1>even know the words are coming out or</v>

1017
00:49:45.101 --> 00:49:48.130
<v Speaker 1>responses happening and it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not remotely deliberate at all,</v>

1018
00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:50.920
<v Speaker 1>but it's the right thing in that moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the right thing that someone needed</v>

1019
00:49:50.921 --> 00:49:53.800
<v Speaker 1>to hear or you needed to hear and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>feels incredible.</v>

1020
00:49:53.830 --> 00:49:57.670
<v Speaker 1>It feels like it feels effortless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the effortlessness that comes</v>

1021
00:49:57.671 --> 00:50:00.070
<v Speaker 1>out of preparedness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Previous effort.</v>

1022
00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:00.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1023
00:50:00.881 --> 00:50:02.800
<v Speaker 1>You have to have both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just wing it,</v>

1024
00:50:02.890 --> 00:50:04.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be prepared,</v>

1025
00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:08.890
<v Speaker 1>but you also have to be able to just be</v>
<v Speaker 1>flexible in the moment and to be able to</v>

1026
00:50:08.891 --> 00:50:09.720
<v Speaker 1>ride the.</v>

1027
00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:12.390
<v Speaker 3>It comes back to the word that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>started with his surrender.</v>

1028
00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:14.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I noticed this a lot because I do a</v>

1029
00:50:14.671 --> 00:50:19.560
<v Speaker 3>lot of traveling around and giving</v>
<v Speaker 3>speeches and I'm always about meditation</v>

1030
00:50:19.561 --> 00:50:21.150
<v Speaker 3>and I'll have my little shtick that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

1031
00:50:21.151 --> 00:50:26.151
<v Speaker 3>but then I will open it up for questions</v>
<v Speaker 3>and actually the same thing is true for</v>

1032
00:50:26.461 --> 00:50:30.860
<v Speaker 3>when I'm live on good morning America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know where I have to.</v>

1033
00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:34.580
<v Speaker 3>If I'm in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm thinking about what I should say</v>

1034
00:50:34.581 --> 00:50:38.900
<v Speaker 3>or how things should go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I make the worst mistakes.</v>

1035
00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:43.580
<v Speaker 3>If I can get myself to surrender and</v>
<v Speaker 3>just be there.</v>

1036
00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:46.850
<v Speaker 3>I've been playing with that a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>even in the course of this discussion,</v>

1037
00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:48.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a big podcast.</v>

1038
00:50:48.861 --> 00:50:49.880
<v Speaker 3>Don't screw it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say that.</v>

1039
00:50:49.881 --> 00:50:51.650
<v Speaker 3>Don't say that they'll do the dumb thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1040
00:50:51.651 --> 00:50:52.191
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

1041
00:50:52.191 --> 00:50:52.620
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

1042
00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:53.900
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>

1043
00:50:53.901 --> 00:50:58.370
<v Speaker 3>if I can just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let all of that chatter go away,</v>

1044
00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:02.690
<v Speaker 3>play itself out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you have a better conversation.</v>

1045
00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:05.990
<v Speaker 3>Then you say the thing that you couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have planned.</v>

1046
00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:09.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is the art of the podcast is the</v>

1047
00:51:09.211 --> 00:51:14.040
<v Speaker 2>art of conversation in general is to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of your own way and to be able to</v>

1048
00:51:14.041 --> 00:51:17.400
<v Speaker 2>also at the same time find the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>words,</v>

1049
00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:21.840
<v Speaker 2>articulate the right thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>figuring out the right way to the piece,</v>

1050
00:51:21.841 --> 00:51:25.320
<v Speaker 2>the sentences together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's both entertaining and engaging</v>

1051
00:51:25.590 --> 00:51:30.170
<v Speaker 2>but also rings true and there's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an,</v>

1052
00:51:30.171 --> 00:51:34.140
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an air of bullshit to it or a ego to it</v>

1053
00:51:34.141 --> 00:51:35.730
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because people can.</v>

1054
00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:38.460
<v Speaker 2>There's a unique thing about a</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>

1055
00:51:38.461 --> 00:51:42.720
<v Speaker 2>especially with people interacting with</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other that people they tune in to</v>

1056
00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:45.120
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I tune into it like if I listen to</v>

1057
00:51:45.121 --> 00:51:48.510
<v Speaker 2>certain conversations with people that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>find awkward and I'm like,</v>

1058
00:51:48.511 --> 00:51:50.010
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is uncomfortable about this?</v>

1059
00:51:50.011 --> 00:51:51.330
<v Speaker 2>What is this weird?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And see it.</v>

1060
00:51:51.331 --> 00:51:55.530
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times it boils down to like one</v>
<v Speaker 2>person trying to be too much in control.</v>

1061
00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:56.580
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1062
00:51:56.581 --> 00:51:57.414
<v Speaker 2>Or yeah,</v>

1063
00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:58.950
<v Speaker 3>personally I'm usually that person.</v>

1064
00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:00.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody is.</v>

1065
00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:02.510
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell when you're hanging out</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that person because it's like</v>

1066
00:52:02.770 --> 00:52:05.240
<v Speaker 1>there's this grippiness or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or when I have that,</v>

1067
00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:07.300
<v Speaker 1>it's like your study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fearful usually word and you're,</v>

1068
00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:11.360
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to hold onto the narrative</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it just creates this unnatural nus.</v>

1069
00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then everyone's got a little bit,</v>

1070
00:52:12.970 --> 00:52:16.460
<v Speaker 1>it feels a little bit weird and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's trying to overcompensate with</v>

1071
00:52:16.461 --> 00:52:19.790
<v Speaker 1>someone over here and it just wrecks the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole flow of it.</v>

1072
00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:21.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I first started reading a little</v>

1073
00:52:21.351 --> 00:52:21.690
<v Speaker 1>bit about that</v>

1074
00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:23.490
<v Speaker 3>Zen Buddhism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which one of the flavors of.</v>

1075
00:52:23.770 --> 00:52:26.230
<v Speaker 3>They talk a lot about spontaneity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1076
00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:28.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it didn't quite zen bounced.</v>

1077
00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:32.310
<v Speaker 3>I didn't quite get that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is what we're talking about</v>

1078
00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:36.300
<v Speaker 3>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they also use this word freshness,</v>

1079
00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:41.510
<v Speaker 3>that if you can get rid of the stale</v>
<v Speaker 3>planned canned stuff and just touch in</v>

1080
00:52:42.721 --> 00:52:45.060
<v Speaker 3>on what's happening right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is fresh,</v>

1081
00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:48.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than the spontaneity arises.</v>

1082
00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:50.180
<v Speaker 1>Can I?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's um,</v>

1083
00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:51.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I got a teacher,</v>

1084
00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:53.690
<v Speaker 1>this Guy Shin Zen young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I think is the,</v>

1085
00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:55.410
<v Speaker 1>the fucking bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to get them on.</v>

1086
00:52:55.411 --> 00:52:56.570
<v Speaker 1>This is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is incredible.</v>

1087
00:52:56.600 --> 00:53:00.510
<v Speaker 1>He is truly amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a super nerd consciousness and he</v>

1088
00:53:00.511 --> 00:53:04.590
<v Speaker 1>is really articulate about the dynamics</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's trained a lot within the zen</v>

1089
00:53:04.591 --> 00:53:08.860
<v Speaker 1>tradition but also in kind of old school</v>
<v Speaker 1>theravada like the more strict sue's</v>

1090
00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:11.520
<v Speaker 1>name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>s h I,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And he actually likes Ms Dot Martial</v>

1093
00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Arts and he guides people while watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>mixed martial arts in his undershirt.</v>

1094
00:53:21.211 --> 00:53:22.710
<v Speaker 1>And he's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the wicked too.</v>

1095
00:53:22.850 --> 00:53:23.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1096
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:25.880
<v Speaker 3>I can fully that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1097
00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:26.250
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1098
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:26.851
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1099
00:53:26.851 --> 00:53:29.570
<v Speaker 1>but he talks a lot about something</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the zen bounce because he's,</v>

1100
00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:31.050
<v Speaker 1>he's interested in how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1101
00:53:31.051 --> 00:53:32.090
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1102
00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:34.440
<v Speaker 1>how do these different practices from</v>
<v Speaker 1>different traditions work?</v>

1103
00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:37.620
<v Speaker 1>Like how do they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the way in which they for you or</v>

1104
00:53:37.621 --> 00:53:40.590
<v Speaker 1>they reduce your suffering and and</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they can look so different on</v>

1105
00:53:40.591 --> 00:53:44.250
<v Speaker 1>paper or actually inexperienced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you might have one kind of meditation</v>

1106
00:53:44.251 --> 00:53:45.540
<v Speaker 1>tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all about just sitting with your</v>

1107
00:53:45.541 --> 00:53:48.270
<v Speaker 1>eyes closed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not moving all about that kind of</v>

1108
00:53:48.271 --> 00:53:52.440
<v Speaker 1>stoicism and then you when you do move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very slow and deliberate and you</v>

1109
00:53:52.441 --> 00:53:56.070
<v Speaker 1>got to be mindful and all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you have other traditions like</v>

1110
00:53:56.071 --> 00:53:59.340
<v Speaker 1>within a certain kinds of schools where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're actually.</v>

1111
00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:01.350
<v Speaker 1>If you it's frenetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like go,</v>

1112
00:54:01.351 --> 00:54:02.250
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go all the time.</v>

1113
00:54:02.251 --> 00:54:04.260
<v Speaker 1>You're moving fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like unwrapping your shit and you</v>

1114
00:54:04.261 --> 00:54:06.210
<v Speaker 1>put your shit back together and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating your food in a particular kind of</v>

1115
00:54:06.211 --> 00:54:07.890
<v Speaker 1>way and you got to get to this thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>over here and you gotta get this thing</v>

1116
00:54:07.891 --> 00:54:10.080
<v Speaker 1>over here and then you got to sit next</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stop on a dime.</v>

1117
00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:14.310
<v Speaker 1>And what they're doing is they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>deliberately shaking things up there.</v>

1118
00:54:14.311 --> 00:54:19.290
<v Speaker 1>Deliberately creating all this agitated</v>
<v Speaker 1>and energy to teach you how to ride the</v>

1119
00:54:19.291 --> 00:54:23.480
<v Speaker 1>energy to teach you how to be calm</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough in the center that you can add</v>

1120
00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:26.580
<v Speaker 1>that energy turns into spontaneity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turns into creativity,</v>

1121
00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:29.430
<v Speaker 1>turns into genuine being available in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment.</v>

1122
00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:32.400
<v Speaker 1>This as opposed to being stuck in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1123
00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:36.150
<v Speaker 1>That's what's getting trained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you see these guys from those</v>

1124
00:54:36.151 --> 00:54:38.790
<v Speaker 1>monasteries are from those traditions</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are really,</v>

1125
00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:42.660
<v Speaker 1>who practice a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got this bouncy available,</v>

1126
00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:44.370
<v Speaker 1>turn on a dime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do this,</v>

1127
00:54:44.371 --> 00:54:45.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like they're just available to</v>

1128
00:54:45.631 --> 00:54:48.130
<v Speaker 1>what's going on because they've trained</v>
<v Speaker 1>that quality in their experience.</v>

1129
00:54:48.131 --> 00:54:50.250
<v Speaker 1>It's gotten out of their own way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've gotten out of their own way.</v>

1130
00:54:50.290 --> 00:54:50.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they would,</v>

1131
00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:52.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean Shin Zahn when you talked to how</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is,</v>

1132
00:54:53.310 --> 00:54:54.091
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1133
00:54:54.091 --> 00:54:57.300
<v Speaker 1>I've had like hundreds of hours of</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussions where I'll call him up,</v>

1134
00:54:57.301 --> 00:54:58.080
<v Speaker 1>I'll be like.</v>

1135
00:54:58.080 --> 00:54:59.760
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best thing about him is he'll answer</v>

1136
00:54:59.761 --> 00:55:01.920
<v Speaker 1>the phone if he's ready to talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's ready to serve,</v>

1137
00:55:01.921 --> 00:55:03.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you got going on.</v>

1138
00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:05.130
<v Speaker 1>I'll be like a column in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shins in.</v>

1139
00:55:05.131 --> 00:55:07.980
<v Speaker 1>So what's going on right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your experience of consciousness?</v>

1140
00:55:08.310 --> 00:55:10.680
<v Speaker 1>And he basically describes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1141
00:55:10.681 --> 00:55:14.010
<v Speaker 1>it's like he's just there and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's sort of part of this upwelling of</v>

1142
00:55:14.011 --> 00:55:16.590
<v Speaker 1>the world and it's all kind of vibrating</v>
<v Speaker 1>up through him.</v>

1143
00:55:16.890 --> 00:55:17.970
<v Speaker 1>He has no center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1144
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:20.610
<v Speaker 1>he asked him where his center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He experiences the center of himself.</v>

1145
00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's over here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's over on the right and</v>

1146
00:55:23.671 --> 00:55:24.361
<v Speaker 1>he's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1147
00:55:24.361 --> 00:55:26.010
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all reality.</v>

1148
00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:31.260
<v Speaker 1>Just this free flow of reality that he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just responding to now and then.</v>

1149
00:55:31.261 --> 00:55:34.020
<v Speaker 1>And then he'll tell me this is the shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would blow my mind.</v>

1150
00:55:34.530 --> 00:55:35.341
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1151
00:55:35.341 --> 00:55:36.060
<v Speaker 1>that sounds awesome.</v>

1152
00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:36.751
<v Speaker 1>But he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1153
00:55:36.751 --> 00:55:39.530
<v Speaker 1>there's challenges for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The challenge is,</v>

1154
00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:44.570
<v Speaker 1>is taking condition seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking condition seriously.</v>

1155
00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:48.510
<v Speaker 1>He has to convince himself that went to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1156
00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:52.020
<v Speaker 1>that the stakes are high enough that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>should work on this thing or that.</v>

1157
00:55:52.021 --> 00:55:53.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I should go to the way that bus.</v>

1158
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.661
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1159
00:55:54.661 --> 00:55:56.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean he will because his instincts</v>
<v Speaker 1>kick in,</v>

1160
00:55:56.521 --> 00:55:59.880
<v Speaker 1>but it's like he's so in the uncondition</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1161
00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:00.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1162
00:56:00.510 --> 00:56:03.300
<v Speaker 1>his danger is just becoming one of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>dudes sitting on a mountain and not</v>

1163
00:56:03.301 --> 00:56:06.450
<v Speaker 1>doing anything but the world is fucked</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it needs people like him who can</v>

1164
00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:07.770
<v Speaker 1>help us out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>

1165
00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:10.130
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's very inspired to,</v>

1166
00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:12.450
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try to do his best to be a great</v>

1167
00:56:12.451 --> 00:56:14.790
<v Speaker 1>meditation teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's his battle.</v>

1168
00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:18.870
<v Speaker 1>He's no longer so most practitioners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their battle is trying to get to taste</v>

1169
00:56:18.871 --> 00:56:21.840
<v Speaker 1>that more unconditioned quality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spontaneous,</v>

1170
00:56:21.841 --> 00:56:24.460
<v Speaker 1>that free the yourself as just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

1171
00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:25.721
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

1172
00:56:25.721 --> 00:56:26.531
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other direction.</v>

1173
00:56:26.531 --> 00:56:30.340
<v Speaker 1>He's gone so far into that now he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to remember what it was like to</v>

1174
00:56:30.341 --> 00:56:33.460
<v Speaker 1>be a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's more like a cosmic rock,</v>

1175
00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:36.130
<v Speaker 1>like there's the vibrating into infinity</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time,</v>

1176
00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:40.420
<v Speaker 1>which is great for stress but not so</v>
<v Speaker 1>great for maybe other things.</v>

1177
00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:42.490
<v Speaker 1>Very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1178
00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:46.680
<v Speaker 1>So he's just been doing this for so long</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she is very high level of.</v>

1179
00:56:46.790 --> 00:56:49.750
<v Speaker 1>He's another Jewish guy from this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Los Angeles.</v>

1180
00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:53.500
<v Speaker 1>He was born in the forties or fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eisenhower,</v>

1181
00:56:53.501 --> 00:56:56.260
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he basically was way into Japan,</v>

1182
00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:59.090
<v Speaker 1>Japanese culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn Japanese as a teenager.</v>

1183
00:56:59.091 --> 00:57:04.091
<v Speaker 1>I went to Japanese school and then went</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Japan when he was like 19 or 20 and</v>

1184
00:57:04.151 --> 00:57:06.710
<v Speaker 1>decided he wanted to study these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1185
00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:09.810
<v Speaker 1>some of the Zen practitioners eventually</v>
<v Speaker 1>got in with a,</v>

1186
00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:10.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1187
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:12.520
<v Speaker 1>what's called the Japanese have Adrianna</v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

1188
00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:14.560
<v Speaker 1>So it's sort of a particular school of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddhism.</v>

1189
00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:17.440
<v Speaker 1>Started training with them and then that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was never finished.</v>

1190
00:57:17.441 --> 00:57:20.320
<v Speaker 1>He was getting a phd program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do hardcore stuff like that.</v>

1191
00:57:20.350 --> 00:57:22.930
<v Speaker 1>You have an ice baths and things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

1192
00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1193
00:57:23.831 --> 00:57:25.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's all what we're talking about,</v>

1194
00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:27.270
<v Speaker 1>building up resilience building and back</v>
<v Speaker 1>when emily,</v>

1195
00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:30.610
<v Speaker 1>can you sit in these seriously?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they do the in Japan they do the</v>

1196
00:57:30.611 --> 00:57:32.350
<v Speaker 1>thing called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll talk about this.</v>

1197
00:57:32.351 --> 00:57:37.351
<v Speaker 1>The marathon monks were basically these</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys sit for like no joke for days on</v>

1198
00:57:37.901 --> 00:57:41.380
<v Speaker 1>end days not going to the bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not moving,</v>

1199
00:57:41.381 --> 00:57:42.940
<v Speaker 1>not eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not drinking water.</v>

1200
00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:44.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to imagine how it would even</v>

1201
00:57:44.861 --> 00:57:47.410
<v Speaker 1>be possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but apparently it's a televised event on</v>

1202
00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:49.660
<v Speaker 1>in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they do these long walks and then</v>

1203
00:57:49.661 --> 00:57:54.130
<v Speaker 1>they do these sets and these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all about what shinzen would say.</v>

1204
00:57:54.130 --> 00:57:57.670
<v Speaker 1>It's about recycling the reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's all about your hub,</v>

1205
00:57:57.671 --> 00:58:00.040
<v Speaker 1>these responses in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're feeling uncomfortable,</v>

1206
00:58:00.370 --> 00:58:02.620
<v Speaker 1>you're feeling hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're feeling this stuff,</v>

1207
00:58:02.621 --> 00:58:06.790
<v Speaker 1>but if you can bring enough equity and</v>
<v Speaker 1>openness to those sensations,</v>

1208
00:58:06.791 --> 00:58:09.940
<v Speaker 1>then they just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had this happen to me thousands of</v>

1209
00:58:09.941 --> 00:58:12.760
<v Speaker 1>times meditating or the sensation just</v>
<v Speaker 1>boils off.</v>

1210
00:58:12.970 --> 00:58:16.480
<v Speaker 1>It just goes from being pain in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to just vibrating,</v>

1211
00:58:16.481 --> 00:58:19.180
<v Speaker 1>feels like maggots squirming and then it</v>
<v Speaker 1>just wouldn't,</v>

1212
00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:21.490
<v Speaker 1>it just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's all about how,</v>

1213
00:58:21.550 --> 00:58:26.410
<v Speaker 1>how completely present can you be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can metabolize anything stuck and</v>

1214
00:58:26.411 --> 00:58:29.140
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can metabolize stuck physical stuff</v>

1215
00:58:29.141 --> 00:58:31.510
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you put your attention on a knot</v>

1216
00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:33.220
<v Speaker 1>in the back of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1217
00:58:33.221 --> 00:58:34.450
<v Speaker 1>in the back of your shoulder or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1218
00:58:34.451 --> 00:58:37.960
<v Speaker 1>I've had to experience in meditation</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I'm just feeling this tension in</v>

1219
00:58:37.961 --> 00:58:41.770
<v Speaker 1>my body and I just hold my attention</v>
<v Speaker 1>there long enough and this sort of,</v>

1220
00:58:41.771 --> 00:58:42.840
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this open way,</v>

1221
00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:44.020
<v Speaker 1>not trying to make a change.</v>

1222
00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:45.670
<v Speaker 1>Just curious about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking at it.</v>

1223
00:58:45.671 --> 00:58:49.570
<v Speaker 1>I've had the experience of knots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like desolving were like an actual</v>

1224
00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:52.120
<v Speaker 1>impingement or a physical thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed to change.</v>

1225
00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:54.370
<v Speaker 1>Now that's really weird because then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize,</v>

1226
00:58:54.850 --> 00:58:55.750
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look the mind,</v>

1227
00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:58.150
<v Speaker 1>the mind and body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all part of one process,</v>

1228
00:58:58.151 --> 00:59:00.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and at part of what was keeping that</v>

1229
00:59:00.610 --> 00:59:02.770
<v Speaker 1>tension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't just the problem in the</v>

1230
00:59:02.771 --> 00:59:04.480
<v Speaker 1>muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was some part of me that was</v>

1231
00:59:04.481 --> 00:59:06.490
<v Speaker 1>keeping it there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was some way in which I was</v>

1232
00:59:06.491 --> 00:59:09.520
<v Speaker 1>holding onto it a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like holding my breath a bit,</v>

1233
00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:11.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or like when you said about releasing</v>

1234
00:59:11.381 --> 00:59:15.040
<v Speaker 1>layers of tension and you sit down on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>meditation cushion and you think you're</v>

1235
00:59:15.041 --> 00:59:18.250
<v Speaker 1>relaxed and you realize you're actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of uptight and you're like,</v>

1236
00:59:18.450 --> 00:59:21.200
<v Speaker 1>and then you let go of that and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you said a little bit more than you</v>

1237
00:59:21.201 --> 00:59:26.201
<v Speaker 1>realize there's another layer of tension</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can just let go and let go and</v>

1238
00:59:27.291 --> 00:59:27.800
<v Speaker 1>let go.</v>

1239
00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:30.350
<v Speaker 1>And it just seems to go on and on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

1240
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:31.730
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be.</v>

1241
00:59:31.731 --> 00:59:34.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know another teacher only teaches is</v>

1242
00:59:34.251 --> 00:59:36.110
<v Speaker 1>lying down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She teaches people,</v>

1243
00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:38.130
<v Speaker 1>Reggie Ray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to a Dota,</v>

1244
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:39.180
<v Speaker 1>go to his meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resets.</v>

1245
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:40.820
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're laying on the ground.</v>

1246
00:59:40.821 --> 00:59:42.320
<v Speaker 1>You're not doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could fall asleep,</v>

1247
00:59:42.321 --> 00:59:45.470
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter for a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just laying on the ground and he's</v>

1248
00:59:45.471 --> 00:59:48.620
<v Speaker 1>teaching you how to actually land on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>

1249
00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:53.150
<v Speaker 1>You could spend a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two weeks learning how to actually lay</v>

1250
00:59:53.151 --> 00:59:55.350
<v Speaker 1>on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think you're laying on the ground</v>

1251
00:59:55.351 --> 00:59:58.610
<v Speaker 1>where you're still a little bit tense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're still a little bit holding</v>

1252
00:59:58.611 --> 01:00:02.060
<v Speaker 1>yourself up in some way and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just letting go of those layers</v>

1253
01:00:02.061 --> 01:00:04.730
<v Speaker 1>and letting go of those layers until</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just like a pool.</v>

1254
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:09.140
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all know that we need conscious</v>

1255
01:00:09.141 --> 01:00:09.974
<v Speaker 1>awareness.</v>

1256
01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:15.580
<v Speaker 1>We need the to be here and present,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also that thinking of conscious</v>

1257
01:00:17.751 --> 01:00:22.751
<v Speaker 1>awareness and the control that we try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>enact on our environment and all the</v>

1258
01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:28.840
<v Speaker 1>different ways that the ego forces us to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think and pushes us and nudges us.</v>

1259
01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:32.900
<v Speaker 1>He really is about getting out of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>own way.</v>

1260
01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:37.370
<v Speaker 1>In a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's a paradox to because the only</v>

1261
01:00:37.371 --> 01:00:41.450
<v Speaker 1>way to truly surrender to reality is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>not fucking care.</v>

1262
01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:44.120
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1263
01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:47.450
<v Speaker 1>and that's what's going to free you up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the most effective in your caring.</v>

1264
01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:49.820
<v Speaker 1>You cannot get around that head fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it is.</v>

1265
01:00:49.870 --> 01:00:51.470
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is absolutely true.</v>

1266
01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:52.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1267
01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:55.530
<v Speaker 3>so we would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is the thing that people</v>

1268
01:00:55.531 --> 01:00:59.070
<v Speaker 3>really struggle with because a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people here will hear everything you</v>

1269
01:00:59.071 --> 01:01:03.830
<v Speaker 3>just said and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all this stuff about Shinzen,</v>

1270
01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:05.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not caring and think,</v>

1271
01:01:05.791 --> 01:01:06.720
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I meditate,</v>

1272
01:01:06.721 --> 01:01:09.180
<v Speaker 3>well I'm going to be ineffective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to be able to do it.</v>

1273
01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:10.890
<v Speaker 1>But that's what I'm saying is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>paradox.</v>

1274
01:01:10.891 --> 01:01:13.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like the person who's most</v>
<v Speaker 1>effective as the person who gives up</v>

1275
01:01:13.501 --> 01:01:16.800
<v Speaker 1>needing to be effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you because that's how you</v>

1276
01:01:16.801 --> 01:01:19.320
<v Speaker 1>free up all the energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you're trying to control</v>

1277
01:01:19.321 --> 01:01:21.510
<v Speaker 1>everything all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be really limited in</v>

1278
01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:24.990
<v Speaker 1>what you can actually do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you just let go and let things be as</v>

1279
01:01:24.991 --> 01:01:26.370
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of like,</v>

1280
01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:29.250
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're conserving all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

1281
01:01:29.251 --> 01:01:31.950
<v Speaker 1>deep well of energy that's there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then when you really do need to make a</v>

1282
01:01:31.951 --> 01:01:35.460
<v Speaker 1>move because it does fucking matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you've got the energy to act and</v>

1283
01:01:35.461 --> 01:01:38.490
<v Speaker 1>you act in a way that's probably more</v>
<v Speaker 1>effective because it's less distorted,</v>

1284
01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:42.210
<v Speaker 1>so it's just skillful use of energy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually,</v>

1285
01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:45.720
<v Speaker 1>that's what I've learned from practice</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even from getting older because I'm</v>

1286
01:01:45.721 --> 01:01:47.970
<v Speaker 1>46 now and I don't have the energy I</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to have.</v>

1287
01:01:48.190 --> 01:01:51.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like choosing your battles and</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't seem like now I'm like,</v>

1288
01:01:51.031 --> 01:01:53.280
<v Speaker 1>that seems really tiring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do that.</v>

1289
01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:56.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to actually just sit here and</v>
<v Speaker 1>chill and relax so I'll have the energy</v>

1290
01:01:56.701 --> 01:01:58.440
<v Speaker 1>to do what I need to do when I need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

1291
01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:01.800
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of that maturity is sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a big part of the.</v>

1292
01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:03.980
<v Speaker 1>The meditative like learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1293
01:02:03.981 --> 01:02:08.820
<v Speaker 1>so it's so interesting what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about as well as it relates to</v>

1294
01:02:08.821 --> 01:02:11.020
<v Speaker 1>like how when you're on good morning</v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

1295
01:02:11.030 --> 01:02:15.600
<v Speaker 1>like just sort of figuring out a way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>just be in the moment and guide the</v>

1296
01:02:15.601 --> 01:02:18.210
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't think too much about what</v>

1297
01:02:18.211 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but say the</v>

1298
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:24.780
<v Speaker 2>right things and have poignant things</v>
<v Speaker 2>and good questions and being able to</v>

1299
01:02:24.781 --> 01:02:29.250
<v Speaker 2>engage but not being too conscious of</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it sounds or what you're trying to</v>

1300
01:02:29.251 --> 01:02:33.180
<v Speaker 2>achieve by your words or the image that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to portray.</v>

1301
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:34.390
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

1302
01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:39.330
<v Speaker 2>There's so many parallels that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>exist in standup comedy of that exist in</v>

1303
01:02:39.331 --> 01:02:42.360
<v Speaker 2>podcasting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They exist in martial arts like when</v>

1304
01:02:42.361 --> 01:02:46.800
<v Speaker 2>you're doing martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big part of being able to train</v>

1305
01:02:46.801 --> 01:02:51.801
<v Speaker 2>effectively is to focus almost entirely</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the movements themselves.</v>

1306
01:02:53.010 --> 01:02:57.660
<v Speaker 2>To have them trained into a way where</v>
<v Speaker 2>there a pathway that you can almost</v>

1307
01:02:57.661 --> 01:03:01.860
<v Speaker 2>observe like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're the observer and a passenger.</v>

1308
01:03:01.861 --> 01:03:05.100
<v Speaker 2>As much as you're the driver of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience that it's all just sort of</v>

1309
01:03:05.101 --> 01:03:09.090
<v Speaker 2>taking place and when you start tweaking</v>
<v Speaker 2>and freaking out about it,</v>

1310
01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:13.470
<v Speaker 2>that's when everything tightens up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when you start to run into all</v>

1311
01:03:13.471 --> 01:03:15.420
<v Speaker 2>these real issues with training.</v>

1312
01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:17.530
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why I find basic.</v>

1313
01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:18.700
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've talked a lot about.</v>

1314
01:03:18.701 --> 01:03:22.480
<v Speaker 3>Jeff has talked as he always does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very beautifully about deep end of the</v>

1315
01:03:22.481 --> 01:03:25.000
<v Speaker 3>pool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1316
01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:28.630
<v Speaker 3>mysticism and highly attained</v>
<v Speaker 3>meditators,</v>

1317
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:29.860
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1318
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:35.470
<v Speaker 3>the nuts and bolts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basic application of beginners,</v>

1319
01:03:36.670 --> 01:03:40.630
<v Speaker 3>mindfulness meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which Jeff and I talk about is what</v>

1320
01:03:40.631 --> 01:03:43.960
<v Speaker 3>allows you to get out of your own way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because saying to people,</v>

1321
01:03:43.961 --> 01:03:45.100
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get out of your own way.</v>

1322
01:03:45.101 --> 01:03:47.830
<v Speaker 3>Get Out of your head is a very</v>
<v Speaker 3>frustrating thing to hear because you're</v>

1323
01:03:47.831 --> 01:03:49.770
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the hell do I do so?</v>

1324
01:03:49.930 --> 01:03:52.740
<v Speaker 3>But the basic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the basic move of,</v>

1325
01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:55.420
<v Speaker 3>of what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of of beginner meditation,</v>

1326
01:03:55.421 --> 01:03:59.260
<v Speaker 3>which is to sit with your eyes closed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bring your full attention to the feeling</v>

1327
01:03:59.261 --> 01:04:03.040
<v Speaker 3>of your breath coming in and going out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then as soon as you try to do this,</v>

1328
01:04:03.041 --> 01:04:04.590
<v Speaker 3>your mind is going to go bonkers.</v>

1329
01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:05.780
<v Speaker 3>You're going to start thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1330
01:04:05.950 --> 01:04:08.050
<v Speaker 3>what's for lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where do I need a haircut,</v>

1331
01:04:08.051 --> 01:04:09.370
<v Speaker 3>where did dribbles run wild,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

1332
01:04:09.371 --> 01:04:10.204
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

1333
01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:13.690
<v Speaker 3>and the whole game is just to notice</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you've become distracted in a</v>

1334
01:04:13.691 --> 01:04:16.360
<v Speaker 3>nonjudgmental,</v>
<v Speaker 3>friendly way.</v>

1335
01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:17.800
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's anger.</v>

1336
01:04:17.830 --> 01:04:19.690
<v Speaker 3>That's random thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1337
01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:23.650
<v Speaker 3>Let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go back to the breath over and over and</v>

1338
01:04:23.651 --> 01:04:27.970
<v Speaker 3>over ad Infinitum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that basic bicep curl for your brain</v>

1339
01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:32.710
<v Speaker 3>allows you to have a less hostile</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship to your inner chaos,</v>

1340
01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:37.060
<v Speaker 3>allows you to see it clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that is the mechanism by which all</v>

1341
01:04:37.061 --> 01:04:39.670
<v Speaker 3>have for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least by which all of the things</v>

1342
01:04:39.671 --> 01:04:41.650
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not freaking out on live</v>

1343
01:04:41.651 --> 01:04:45.460
<v Speaker 3>television being able to survive in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>sensory deprivation tank when you think</v>

1344
01:04:45.461 --> 01:04:49.450
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan my judge you for freaking out</v>
<v Speaker 3>and jumping out all that stuff.</v>

1345
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:53.500
<v Speaker 3>It allows you to see the chatter arise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This basic move that we're doing in</v>

1346
01:04:53.501 --> 01:04:56.080
<v Speaker 3>meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is just sitting back and allowing</v>

1347
01:04:56.081 --> 01:04:59.170
<v Speaker 3>all of this stuff to come up without</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to grab it or push it away,</v>

1348
01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:03.280
<v Speaker 3>can help you in the things that we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about here.</v>

1349
01:05:03.350 --> 01:05:04.990
<v Speaker 3>Martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>standup comedy,</v>

1350
01:05:05.050 --> 01:05:06.580
<v Speaker 3>all of the things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1351
01:05:07.010 --> 01:05:08.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can I just say something about what,</v>

1352
01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:12.190
<v Speaker 3>where it turned a corner for me when I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was practicing because I was terrible</v>

1353
01:05:12.191 --> 01:05:13.730
<v Speaker 3>meditator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1354
01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:16.690
<v Speaker 3>and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was understanding the actual skills</v>

1355
01:05:16.691 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 3>that we're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's</v>

1356
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:21.040
<v Speaker 1>the thing I think that links all what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about here.</v>

1357
01:05:21.041 --> 01:05:24.430
<v Speaker 1>When you talk about martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about being a broadcaster</v>

1358
01:05:24.431 --> 01:05:26.530
<v Speaker 1>and you talked about comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about practice.</v>

1359
01:05:27.070 --> 01:05:32.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like there are particular kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind body skills that we're training and</v>

1360
01:05:32.471 --> 01:05:34.570
<v Speaker 1>those skills are actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have names.</v>

1361
01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:37.930
<v Speaker 1>There's a feeling of that that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening that you can experience when</v>

1362
01:05:37.931 --> 01:05:40.960
<v Speaker 1>you're training that muscle group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was when I started</v>

1363
01:05:40.961 --> 01:05:43.510
<v Speaker 1>understanding things that way because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Shin Zen because he talks about it</v>

1364
01:05:43.511 --> 01:05:45.010
<v Speaker 1>that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Buddhism talks about it that way.</v>

1365
01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:48.610
<v Speaker 1>What the factors of awakening that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're building up concentration,</v>

1366
01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:52.060
<v Speaker 1>which is your capacity just to pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to what you want to pay</v>

1367
01:05:52.061 --> 01:05:53.410
<v Speaker 1>attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a commitment.</v>

1368
01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:55.210
<v Speaker 1>Your mind wanders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bring it back.</v>

1369
01:05:55.450 --> 01:05:58.000
<v Speaker 1>That's one skill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're building up clarity,</v>

1370
01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:00.910
<v Speaker 1>which is your ability to be clear and</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the sermons,</v>

1371
01:06:00.911 --> 01:06:03.900
<v Speaker 1>but what's happening in your experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening in a social experience?</v>

1372
01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:05.380
<v Speaker 1>Is this the right time to say this</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

1373
01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:08.980
<v Speaker 1>What's happening inside me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what am I really feeling and versus</v>

1374
01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:11.530
<v Speaker 1>how my acting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know like so dialing up that</v>

1375
01:06:11.531 --> 01:06:14.020
<v Speaker 1>resolution dial and building up</v>
<v Speaker 1>equanimity,</v>

1376
01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:19.060
<v Speaker 1>which is just the can actually not fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>with my experience as it's unfolding.</v>

1377
01:06:19.061 --> 01:06:22.510
<v Speaker 1>Can I have this centeredness in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of what's going on?</v>

1378
01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:24.970
<v Speaker 1>Whether I'm doing martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether I'm doing comedy,</v>

1379
01:06:24.971 --> 01:06:29.240
<v Speaker 1>whether I'm doing meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beauty of meditation practices,</v>

1380
01:06:29.290 --> 01:06:33.700
<v Speaker 1>it makes explicit what those skills are</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a simple situation with your eyes</v>

1381
01:06:33.701 --> 01:06:35.440
<v Speaker 1>closed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can notice when you're being</v>

1382
01:06:35.441 --> 01:06:36.760
<v Speaker 1>concentrated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're being clear,</v>

1383
01:06:36.761 --> 01:06:38.320
<v Speaker 1>when you're being honest with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being friendly,</v>

1384
01:06:38.321 --> 01:06:41.680
<v Speaker 1>which is another good skill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you notice when that's happening</v>

1385
01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:43.230
<v Speaker 1>and because you notice when it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>

1386
01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:46.270
<v Speaker 1>you can start to notice how to apply it</v>
<v Speaker 1>in every other area of your life,</v>

1387
01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:48.220
<v Speaker 1>so that's all it is.</v>

1388
01:06:48.310 --> 01:06:53.170
<v Speaker 1>All practices is about being explicit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and deliberate about what qualities of</v>

1389
01:06:53.171 --> 01:06:57.190
<v Speaker 1>existence of being that you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>train in your life and then you just try</v>

1390
01:06:57.191 --> 01:06:59.830
<v Speaker 1>to apply it everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's why you can get people who</v>

1391
01:06:59.831 --> 01:07:01.690
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see them as basically meditation</v>

1392
01:07:01.691 --> 01:07:06.220
<v Speaker 1>masters on a comedy stage or people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are basically meditation masters in the</v>

1393
01:07:06.221 --> 01:07:08.030
<v Speaker 1>sports arena or in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

1394
01:07:08.031 --> 01:07:11.560
<v Speaker 1>in a cage match or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're applying the same principles.</v>

1395
01:07:11.770 --> 01:07:15.240
<v Speaker 1>So all these are paths that can bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>you into more of a,</v>

1396
01:07:15.570 --> 01:07:19.570
<v Speaker 1>a more presence in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem comes when people</v>

1397
01:07:19.571 --> 01:07:20.010
<v Speaker 1>started saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1398
01:07:20.010 --> 01:07:21.760
<v Speaker 1>but my path was a good path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1399
01:07:21.761 --> 01:07:23.680
<v Speaker 1>but I teach meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's more fundamental,</v>

1400
01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:24.171
<v Speaker 1>or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1401
01:07:24.171 --> 01:07:24.491
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1402
01:07:24.491 --> 01:07:26.520
<v Speaker 1>but I do a body practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is more fundamental.</v>

1403
01:07:26.521 --> 01:07:30.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's about the skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are what's fundamental.</v>

1404
01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:31.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1405
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:34.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the more you can concentrate on</v>

1406
01:07:34.541 --> 01:07:36.520
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more you'll enjoy this weird</v>

1407
01:07:36.521 --> 01:07:38.740
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mystery of this.</v>

1408
01:07:39.350 --> 01:07:42.550
<v Speaker 2>It's this weird experience that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have an owner's manual.</v>

1409
01:07:42.590 --> 01:07:43.750
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do it.</v>

1410
01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:47.170
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things that's always</v>
<v Speaker 2>freaked me out about the mind and the</v>

1411
01:07:47.171 --> 01:07:48.910
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you have this incredible</v>

1412
01:07:48.911 --> 01:07:53.911
<v Speaker 2>vehicle and this amazing resource that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of operating this vehicle and no</v>

1413
01:07:55.121 --> 01:07:57.730
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one gets a manual and you're taught</v>

1414
01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:01.270
<v Speaker 2>how to handle it by people that don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know what the fuck they're doing,</v>

1415
01:08:01.271 --> 01:08:05.410
<v Speaker 2>whether it's teachers in school or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the kids that you grow up</v>

1416
01:08:05.411 --> 01:08:08.890
<v Speaker 2>with or maybe even perhaps your parents</v>
<v Speaker 2>or sports coaches.</v>

1417
01:08:08.891 --> 01:08:13.870
<v Speaker 2>You get shitty operating advice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're grinding the gears and banging</v>

1418
01:08:13.871 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 2>into trees and no one knows how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>handle this</v>

1419
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:16.290
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1420
01:08:16.290 --> 01:08:18.240
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Particularly in our culture.</v>

1421
01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:19.113
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1422
01:08:19.350 --> 01:08:22.620
<v Speaker 3>one of the points that Sam Harris mutual</v>
<v Speaker 3>friend of ours,</v>

1423
01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:26.100
<v Speaker 3>great podcasts are great writer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has made in his book waking up,</v>

1424
01:08:26.101 --> 01:08:30.450
<v Speaker 3>which was one of his many books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think my favorite is that,</v>

1425
01:08:30.451 --> 01:08:33.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the West we've developed an</v>

1426
01:08:33.591 --> 01:08:37.830
<v Speaker 3>intellectual and scientific culture that</v>
<v Speaker 3>is really robust and as changed the</v>

1427
01:08:37.831 --> 01:08:42.831
<v Speaker 3>world and is in unquestionably valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in the east they actually were</v>

1428
01:08:43.711 --> 01:08:46.710
<v Speaker 3>working on the owner's manual for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mind for Millennia.</v>

1429
01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:50.790
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to Buddha statues in here 2,600</v>

1430
01:08:50.791 --> 01:08:53.100
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>

1431
01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:55.860
<v Speaker 3>if he even existed or what do we don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't know,</v>

1432
01:08:55.861 --> 01:09:00.861
<v Speaker 3>but this culture of Buddhism and before</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the Hindus were working on how do</v>

1433
01:09:00.961 --> 01:09:03.930
<v Speaker 3>you operate this mind?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is this mind?</v>

1434
01:09:04.350 --> 01:09:07.410
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the beautiful thing we're</v>

1435
01:09:07.411 --> 01:09:11.490
<v Speaker 3>watching now globally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this trend is the meeting of these two</v>

1436
01:09:11.491 --> 01:09:14.370
<v Speaker 3>things and jeff is one of the people is</v>
<v Speaker 3>most excited about.</v>

1437
01:09:14.371 --> 01:09:16.110
<v Speaker 3>This is partly why we're such good</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>

1438
01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:21.240
<v Speaker 3>The meeting of this western scientific</v>
<v Speaker 3>rational culture and this eastern</v>

1439
01:09:21.270 --> 01:09:22.710
<v Speaker 3>exploration of the mind.</v>

1440
01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:26.190
<v Speaker 1>But birla I want to just call you on</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like I think,</v>

1441
01:09:26.490 --> 01:09:30.030
<v Speaker 1>I think that's absolutely true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also think these,</v>

1442
01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:31.770
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

1443
01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:34.620
<v Speaker 1>this understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this way of thinking about it is there</v>

1444
01:09:34.621 --> 01:09:37.800
<v Speaker 1>in the West as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's like the east is made it</v>

1445
01:09:37.801 --> 01:09:41.550
<v Speaker 1>explicit in very particular ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even within humanistic traditions,</v>

1446
01:09:41.551 --> 01:09:43.870
<v Speaker 1>if you look at like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the Greek philosophers who are,</v>

1447
01:09:43.871 --> 01:09:46.650
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them are really mystics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look within the abrahamic</v>

1448
01:09:46.651 --> 01:09:48.480
<v Speaker 1>traditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>

1449
01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:52.470
<v Speaker 1>these understandings are there as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're describing it in similar</v>

1450
01:09:52.471 --> 01:09:56.490
<v Speaker 1>ways and like you hang out with some bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>ass Catholic priest who spent his entire</v>

1451
01:09:56.491 --> 01:10:00.300
<v Speaker 1>life like in poor neighborhoods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>helping people out and like totally</v>

1452
01:10:00.570 --> 01:10:05.570
<v Speaker 1>being present and working on service and</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the way in which that human being has</v>

1453
01:10:06.211 --> 01:10:10.170
<v Speaker 1>learned how to survive and is learn how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to flourish and learn how to be present</v>

1454
01:10:10.230 --> 01:10:14.280
<v Speaker 1>for his community or her community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of the same skills and did</v>

1455
01:10:14.281 --> 01:10:16.110
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's obviously shadowy aspects</v>

1456
01:10:16.111 --> 01:10:18.110
<v Speaker 1>everywhere too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1457
01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:19.230
<v Speaker 1>these are human universals.</v>

1458
01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:21.050
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a book,</v>

1459
01:10:21.051 --> 01:10:24.590
<v Speaker 3>there's just to being a bad ass priest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a book called Tattoos on the</v>

1460
01:10:24.591 --> 01:10:26.230
<v Speaker 3>heart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was written by the guy who wrote,</v>

1461
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:30.710
<v Speaker 3>ran homeboy industries here in la.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And He,</v>

1462
01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:32.960
<v Speaker 3>as far as I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have any meditation practice,</v>

1463
01:10:32.961 --> 01:10:37.430
<v Speaker 3>but he talks about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a bit of a sappy word,</v>

1464
01:10:37.431 --> 01:10:38.750
<v Speaker 3>but compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1465
01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:42.650
<v Speaker 3>at actually giving a shit about other</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings about whom very few other</v>

1466
01:10:42.651 --> 01:10:45.320
<v Speaker 3>people give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And his whole life is the organizing</v>

1467
01:10:45.321 --> 01:10:47.540
<v Speaker 3>principle is taken care of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These gang members,</v>

1468
01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:48.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's,</v>

1469
01:10:48.690 --> 01:10:51.560
<v Speaker 3>who have had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who've been discarded by their family's,</v>

1470
01:10:51.561 --> 01:10:55.880
<v Speaker 3>grown up with parents who were in</v>
<v Speaker 3>prostitution or drugs or whatever and</v>

1471
01:10:55.881 --> 01:11:00.881
<v Speaker 3>had no shot and this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his whole life has given them a shot and</v>

1472
01:11:00.891 --> 01:11:04.850
<v Speaker 3>if that's not a living this stuff out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I don't know what it is.</v>

1473
01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:07.050
<v Speaker 1>Why do we think compassion is the sappy</v>
<v Speaker 1>word?</v>

1474
01:11:07.051 --> 01:11:10.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm just wondering because I know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so common to have those responses.</v>

1475
01:11:10.290 --> 01:11:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Like what does that do you think</v>

1476
01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:14.130
<v Speaker 3>problem with that we were talking with</v>
<v Speaker 3>soul cycle before,</v>

1477
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:14.963
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they,</v>

1478
01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:17.010
<v Speaker 1>it's the presentation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1479
01:11:17.011 --> 01:11:19.920
<v Speaker 1>when you eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's through repetition.</v>

1480
01:11:19.921 --> 01:11:23.070
<v Speaker 1>It loses its meaning and then sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the sense,</v>

1481
01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:25.970
<v Speaker 1>I get the sense at least they would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people who were saying this to me</v>

1482
01:11:26.130 --> 01:11:28.440
<v Speaker 1>have no idea what it is they're saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>or why.</v>

1483
01:11:28.730 --> 01:11:29.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Co op,</v>

1484
01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:34.860
<v Speaker 1>they're clunky now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just a signaling their tribal</v>

1485
01:11:34.861 --> 01:11:39.740
<v Speaker 1>allegiance to a Unicorns or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By just repeating these phrases are</v>

1486
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:41.640
<v Speaker 1>really embodying what they mean or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1487
01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:43.020
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the people that say that,</v>

1488
01:11:43.021 --> 01:11:44.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm not religious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm spiritual.</v>

1489
01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:45.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1490
01:11:45.810 --> 01:11:49.530
<v Speaker 1>And they say that you let go Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

1491
01:11:49.531 --> 01:11:52.290
<v Speaker 1>I hear that I just hear somebody who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to connect these principles and</v>

1492
01:11:52.291 --> 01:11:55.710
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want to necessarily identify</v>
<v Speaker 1>with some of these structured forms of</v>

1493
01:11:55.711 --> 01:11:56.820
<v Speaker 1>religion that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>

1494
01:11:56.940 --> 01:12:01.200
<v Speaker 1>that all these fucking problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's that and sometimes it's</v>

1495
01:12:01.201 --> 01:12:04.440
<v Speaker 1>just weird people that are just making</v>
<v Speaker 1>noises with their face because they want</v>

1496
01:12:04.441 --> 01:12:06.260
<v Speaker 1>you to think a certain way about that.</v>

1497
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:10.480
<v Speaker 1>Making noises with your face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now thing that people do where</v>

1498
01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:13.080
<v Speaker 1>they're just really just saying noises</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they,</v>

1499
01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:17.310
<v Speaker 1>they hear other people say and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not connected to them and you feel</v>

1500
01:12:17.311 --> 01:12:19.710
<v Speaker 1>they're not connected to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you just kind of waiting it out.</v>

1501
01:12:19.711 --> 01:12:21.930
<v Speaker 1>So it's hypocrisy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hypocrisy that makes you want to</v>

1502
01:12:21.931 --> 01:12:24.510
<v Speaker 1>puke because it's a disconnect between</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's real,</v>

1503
01:12:24.511 --> 01:12:25.620
<v Speaker 1>which.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know it's real because you</v>

1504
01:12:25.621 --> 01:12:27.540
<v Speaker 1>can feel their body language and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're saying,</v>

1505
01:12:27.541 --> 01:12:29.400
<v Speaker 1>which is the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even when it's real.</v>

1506
01:12:29.401 --> 01:12:31.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was my problem when I first started</v>

1507
01:12:31.141 --> 01:12:33.030
<v Speaker 1>getting into meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even when it's real,</v>

1508
01:12:33.031 --> 01:12:35.250
<v Speaker 1>there's an earnestness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lack of sense.</v>

1509
01:12:35.251 --> 01:12:40.251
<v Speaker 1>If there's a sadness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a saccharin about the presentation of</v>

1510
01:12:40.710 --> 01:12:43.200
<v Speaker 1>these really fresh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing,</v>

1511
01:12:43.201 --> 01:12:45.180
<v Speaker 1>invigorating ideas that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I,</v>

1512
01:12:45.181 --> 01:12:46.680
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is why I wanted to write a book</v>

1513
01:12:46.681 --> 01:12:49.740
<v Speaker 1>with you because you talk about these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things in ways they got me interested as</v>

1514
01:12:49.741 --> 01:12:54.741
<v Speaker 1>opposed to sometimes the preciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's precious and I had this beautiful</v>

1515
01:12:55.381 --> 01:12:57.530
<v Speaker 1>little box that I'm going to unfold for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and it's like,</v>

1516
01:12:57.710 --> 01:13:00.870
<v Speaker 1>and it's so holy and perfect and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like this whole thing around just</v>

1517
01:13:00.871 --> 01:13:03.240
<v Speaker 1>makes me want to fucking vomit as soon</v>
<v Speaker 1>as they get anywhere near it.</v>

1518
01:13:03.870 --> 01:13:06.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like certain yoga teachers can say</v>

1519
01:13:06.361 --> 01:13:11.361
<v Speaker 1>the exact same thing and it's calming</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when they say no a you say it back</v>

1520
01:13:12.151 --> 01:13:13.470
<v Speaker 1>you totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1521
01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:15.030
<v Speaker 1>And then the other ones say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

1522
01:13:15.031 --> 01:13:17.880
<v Speaker 1>will you please shut the fuck up buddy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have a,</v>

1523
01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:23.300
<v Speaker 1>I have a trainer that I work with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this bad ass woman named jade.</v>

1524
01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:26.820
<v Speaker 1>Jade Alexis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was a former j dot j dot Alexis,</v>

1525
01:13:26.821 --> 01:13:30.390
<v Speaker 1>former golden gloves boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's just,</v>

1526
01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:32.580
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would take spin classes from her,</v>

1527
01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:34.510
<v Speaker 1>not like just straight up spinning</v>
<v Speaker 1>classes.</v>

1528
01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:38.430
<v Speaker 1>You would just get in your face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turn up your resistance dial for you</v>

1529
01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:42.450
<v Speaker 1>while you're in the middle of a sprint</v>
<v Speaker 1>is just a total bad ass and so I started</v>

1530
01:13:42.451 --> 01:13:45.540
<v Speaker 1>working with her one on one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She is the first person who got me to do</v>

1531
01:13:45.541 --> 01:13:49.290
<v Speaker 1>yoga because when she says not mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll say it right back to her.</v>

1532
01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:51.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1533
01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:53.640
<v Speaker 1>I used to take yoga from this guy from</v>
<v Speaker 1>South Africa.</v>

1534
01:13:53.641 --> 01:13:58.410
<v Speaker 1>He was amazing and he would say all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you would hate most coming</v>

1535
01:13:58.411 --> 01:14:01.830
<v Speaker 1>out of insincere people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you knew he really believed it and</v>

1536
01:14:01.831 --> 01:14:05.970
<v Speaker 1>he also was one of the rare guys and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ran into a few people that do this,</v>

1537
01:14:05.971 --> 01:14:10.971
<v Speaker 1>that run a donation only yoga class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was fascinating for because I</v>

1538
01:14:11.471 --> 01:14:12.304
<v Speaker 1>would watch these</v>

1539
01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:17.580
<v Speaker 2>people pull in in a Mercedes and not</v>
<v Speaker 2>donate and take classes for free and</v>

1540
01:14:17.621 --> 01:14:20.290
<v Speaker 2>leave and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is amazing.</v>

1541
01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:24.520
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing to watch like how many</v>
<v Speaker 2>people take advantage of that and it's</v>

1542
01:14:24.521 --> 01:14:28.120
<v Speaker 2>amazing that the concept of it is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>purest expression of yoga.</v>

1543
01:14:28.121 --> 01:14:30.220
<v Speaker 2>You can get totally like give what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>

1544
01:14:30.221 --> 01:14:31.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna charge you anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

1545
01:14:31.670 --> 01:14:35.860
<v Speaker 2>That's not what this is about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is about the yoga itself and if</v>

1546
01:14:35.890 --> 01:14:38.800
<v Speaker 2>people contribute enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can continue to do this and we could</v>

1547
01:14:38.801 --> 01:14:43.801
<v Speaker 2>pay the rent and he managed to keep the</v>
<v Speaker 2>place open that way because he was so</v>

1548
01:14:43.901 --> 01:14:45.280
<v Speaker 2>good and it was so real.</v>

1549
01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:47.230
<v Speaker 1>Many meditation teachers operate this</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

1550
01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:49.520
<v Speaker 1>many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how the CCO nation owning.</v>

1551
01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:53.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great if it could work,</v>

1552
01:14:53.111 --> 01:14:53.630
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

1553
01:14:53.630 --> 01:14:55.960
<v Speaker 1>That's how kind of it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1554
01:14:56.170 --> 01:14:58.540
<v Speaker 1>We have A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a group in Toronto called the</v>

1555
01:14:58.541 --> 01:15:02.740
<v Speaker 1>consciousness explorers club that my</v>
<v Speaker 1>friend James and I started like eight</v>

1556
01:15:02.741 --> 01:15:07.020
<v Speaker 1>years ago or something and we try to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that principle and the idea is that</v>

1557
01:15:07.021 --> 01:15:10.930
<v Speaker 1>every week we get together and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>explored it and practices and we</v>

1558
01:15:10.931 --> 01:15:12.700
<v Speaker 1>explore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we do a part two so we might,</v>

1559
01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:16.720
<v Speaker 1>which is like a social practice or</v>
<v Speaker 1>interactive or body practice and the</v>

1560
01:15:16.721 --> 01:15:20.170
<v Speaker 1>whole thinking is basically like we want</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to be kind of one stop shopping.</v>

1561
01:15:20.171 --> 01:15:22.720
<v Speaker 1>That whoever you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever your background and how much</v>

1562
01:15:22.721 --> 01:15:25.000
<v Speaker 1>money you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can come once a week to this place</v>

1563
01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:27.490
<v Speaker 1>and it will cost you nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have no money,</v>

1564
01:15:27.670 --> 01:15:28.390
<v Speaker 1>it'll cost you.</v>

1565
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:30.490
<v Speaker 1>The sliding scale is 10 to 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have money,</v>

1566
01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:34.090
<v Speaker 1>you'll get the absolute best of what we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do with guest teachers.</v>

1567
01:15:34.091 --> 01:15:36.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every Monday is a different set of</v>

1568
01:15:36.491 --> 01:15:39.580
<v Speaker 1>programming and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we'll do and we'll do</v>

1569
01:15:39.581 --> 01:15:41.050
<v Speaker 1>that as much as we can for you and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

1570
01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:44.320
<v Speaker 1>And then you can go home and do go back</v>
<v Speaker 1>to your life and if you need referrals</v>

1571
01:15:44.321 --> 01:15:49.060
<v Speaker 1>for more help there potentially there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this idea that once a week anywhere</v>

1572
01:15:49.061 --> 01:15:51.250
<v Speaker 1>in any community in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just go to a place where you</v>

1573
01:15:51.251 --> 01:15:54.850
<v Speaker 1>could get the best and it's affordable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason that can't happen</v>

1574
01:15:55.060 --> 01:15:58.690
<v Speaker 1>because there are so many skilled</v>
<v Speaker 1>practitioners out there and teachers and</v>

1575
01:15:58.691 --> 01:16:02.080
<v Speaker 1>facilitators and different modalities</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's just exploding across the board</v>

1576
01:16:02.081 --> 01:16:05.560
<v Speaker 1>like psychotherapies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploding meditations exploding like</v>

1577
01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:09.610
<v Speaker 1>body therapy based therapies are</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploding like insights about a house,</v>

1578
01:16:09.611 --> 01:16:11.470
<v Speaker 1>sports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how sports work,</v>

1579
01:16:11.471 --> 01:16:13.060
<v Speaker 1>how the mind body works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploding.</v>

1580
01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:16.090
<v Speaker 1>So there's all this diet stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>movement stuff,</v>

1581
01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:19.700
<v Speaker 1>all this expertise out there and it just</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to way.</v>

1582
01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:22.390
<v Speaker 1>We wanted to create a framework where we</v>
<v Speaker 1>could start to channel some of that</v>

1583
01:16:22.450 --> 01:16:23.530
<v Speaker 1>expertise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1584
01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:26.530
<v Speaker 1>get together and have an adventure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explore what this particular modality</v>

1585
01:16:26.531 --> 01:16:28.890
<v Speaker 1>has to say and then and then do it all</v>
<v Speaker 1>in communities.</v>

1586
01:16:28.910 --> 01:16:31.210
<v Speaker 1>You get that community support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1587
01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:33.280
<v Speaker 1>Well I think that's good with</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

1588
01:16:33.281 --> 01:16:35.280
<v Speaker 1>I think having these shared</v>

1589
01:16:35.530 --> 01:16:39.910
<v Speaker 2>differences and sort of relating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the hiccups that you found</v>

1590
01:16:39.911 --> 01:16:42.400
<v Speaker 2>along the way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the pitfalls?</v>

1591
01:16:42.430 --> 01:16:44.520
<v Speaker 2>How have you overcome those?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1592
01:16:44.590 --> 01:16:49.170
<v Speaker 2>there's great value to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's in meditation or we use</v>

1593
01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:52.690
<v Speaker 2>that in comedy a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of like one of the great</v>

1594
01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:56.470
<v Speaker 2>things about communities like the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 2>stores that we get together and talk</v>

1595
01:16:56.471 --> 01:17:00.310
<v Speaker 2>about the pitfalls like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the middle of the set and I'm on</v>

1596
01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:02.200
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on some of them in my own head and then</v>

1597
01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:05.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm realizing this bit's kind of clunky</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm trying to get out of it and</v>

1598
01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:06.311
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

1599
01:17:06.311 --> 01:17:08.990
<v Speaker 2>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a group therapy for sure.</v>

1600
01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:10.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of that.</v>

1601
01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:14.660
<v Speaker 2>Like one of the things that's really</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting about standup in general</v>

1602
01:17:14.661 --> 01:17:18.200
<v Speaker 2>today as opposed to in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the consciousness of it is sort</v>

1603
01:17:18.201 --> 01:17:20.600
<v Speaker 2>of shifted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the past,</v>

1604
01:17:20.601 --> 01:17:25.601
<v Speaker 2>it used to be a very solitary pursuit</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everybody was sort of fighting in a</v>

1605
01:17:26.330 --> 01:17:30.430
<v Speaker 2>scarcity mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a famine thinking mindset that</v>

1606
01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:33.080
<v Speaker 2>there's only a certain amount of slots</v>
<v Speaker 2>on sitcoms.</v>

1607
01:17:33.230 --> 01:17:37.040
<v Speaker 2>There's a certain amount of host jobs</v>
<v Speaker 2>for late night talk shows and there's</v>

1608
01:17:37.041 --> 01:17:39.890
<v Speaker 2>only certain amount of jobs are comics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of clubs to work at.</v>

1609
01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:45.020
<v Speaker 2>Well now there's so many clubs to work</v>
<v Speaker 2>at so many theaters on top of the clubs.</v>

1610
01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:50.200
<v Speaker 2>There's all these internet places where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do podcasts and there's so many</v>

1611
01:17:50.841 --> 01:17:55.841
<v Speaker 2>different avenues that comics don't feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>this famine mindset anymore and it's</v>

1612
01:17:56.931 --> 01:17:59.600
<v Speaker 2>much more of an open and supportive</v>
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

1613
01:17:59.690 --> 01:18:02.300
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that in part is driven by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that there are more women in</v>

1614
01:18:02.301 --> 01:18:05.750
<v Speaker 1>comedy as well and they they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can sometimes bring a little more</v>

1615
01:18:05.751 --> 01:18:06.650
<v Speaker 1>civilized approach?</v>

1616
01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:10.190
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's true that they do do that</v>

1617
01:18:10.191 --> 01:18:11.480
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

1618
01:18:11.481 --> 01:18:13.700
<v Speaker 2>that's not what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a lack of scarcity,</v>

1619
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:19.000
<v Speaker 2>it's structural and it's also more</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who have meditated,</v>

1620
01:18:20.570 --> 01:18:22.640
<v Speaker 2>who have explored their consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

1621
01:18:22.730 --> 01:18:27.730
<v Speaker 2>who are aware of the pitfalls of the ego</v>
<v Speaker 2>entering into comedy and then more</v>

1622
01:18:29.871 --> 01:18:32.840
<v Speaker 2>people sort of fostering that idea of</v>
<v Speaker 2>community through.</v>

1623
01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:33.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1624
01:18:33.330 --> 01:18:36.480
<v Speaker 1>I was surprised there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a reasonable amount of comedians</v>

1625
01:18:36.510 --> 01:18:40.560
<v Speaker 1>and some of them have come on my podcast</v>
<v Speaker 1>today to talk about how meditation helps</v>

1626
01:18:40.561 --> 01:18:43.680
<v Speaker 1>them in what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Millennials in particular,</v>

1627
01:18:43.681 --> 01:18:44.370
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1628
01:18:44.370 --> 01:18:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very funny and very nice guy.</v>

1629
01:18:47.150 --> 01:18:50.040
<v Speaker 1>You kind of realized that the comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the comic is kind of like the canary in</v>

1630
01:18:50.041 --> 01:18:53.700
<v Speaker 1>the coal mine because the comedians are</v>
<v Speaker 1>really sensitive,</v>

1631
01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:55.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's kind of part of what it</v>

1632
01:18:55.531 --> 01:18:59.250
<v Speaker 1>means to be a comedian is to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitive to noticing cues and</v>

1633
01:18:59.251 --> 01:19:01.830
<v Speaker 1>subtleties and things in the culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>that other people overlook,</v>

1634
01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:04.260
<v Speaker 1>so it's not okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what I hear you saying is it's</v>

1635
01:19:04.261 --> 01:19:06.150
<v Speaker 1>almost like some of the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1636
01:19:06.151 --> 01:19:09.750
<v Speaker 1>I hate this word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but evolved or mature people out there.</v>

1637
01:19:09.751 --> 01:19:12.460
<v Speaker 1>Professionals in the world are creative</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the world or people in that</v>

1638
01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:16.620
<v Speaker 1>comedy community because they had that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity and they've had to learn how</v>

1639
01:19:16.621 --> 01:19:18.750
<v Speaker 1>to work together in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1640
01:19:18.751 --> 01:19:20.250
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're like,</v>

1641
01:19:20.251 --> 01:19:21.900
<v Speaker 1>there's something we could learn from</v>
<v Speaker 1>that population,</v>

1642
01:19:21.901 --> 01:19:23.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we look around and saying who can we</v>

1643
01:19:23.971 --> 01:19:26.070
<v Speaker 1>learn from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there something in Comedians and the</v>

1644
01:19:26.071 --> 01:19:29.510
<v Speaker 1>way they're doing things that other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can learn from and what and what</v>

1645
01:19:29.511 --> 01:19:30.840
<v Speaker 1>is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we distill those lessons,</v>

1646
01:19:30.841 --> 01:19:31.391
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1647
01:19:31.391 --> 01:19:32.100
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of</v>

1648
01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:34.390
<v Speaker 2>ways it's an exploration of the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1649
01:19:34.391 --> 01:19:36.250
<v Speaker 2>and I think comedy is an exploration of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mind,</v>

1650
01:19:36.251 --> 01:19:40.270
<v Speaker 2>not just in your own mind but also in</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you relay those thoughts to other</v>

1651
01:19:40.271 --> 01:19:42.220
<v Speaker 2>people and the most efficient way</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

1652
01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:47.380
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of that has to do with how</v>
<v Speaker 2>much have you managed your own mind and</v>

1653
01:19:47.381 --> 01:19:52.330
<v Speaker 2>your own ability to communicate and</v>
<v Speaker 2>meditation can greatly assist you in</v>

1654
01:19:52.331 --> 01:19:54.450
<v Speaker 2>that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you do any meditation?</v>

1655
01:19:54.451 --> 01:19:55.284
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I meditate.</v>

1656
01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:57.100
<v Speaker 2>What's your practice like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1657
01:19:57.101 --> 01:19:59.770
<v Speaker 2>I do a bunch of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

1658
01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:04.720
<v Speaker 2>I do a lot of yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>breathing exercises and do them by</v>

1659
01:20:04.721 --> 01:20:08.940
<v Speaker 2>myself were essentially just completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrating on the breath,</v>

1660
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.570
<v Speaker 2>just breathing in and breathing out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>forcing out all the thoughts and</v>

1661
01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:17.310
<v Speaker 2>allowing them to come in and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>allowing them to leave and I like to do</v>

1662
01:20:17.311 --> 01:20:20.970
<v Speaker 2>that also inside the tank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one of the things that I really</v>

1663
01:20:20.971 --> 01:20:25.971
<v Speaker 2>like to do is get myself into a position</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I've settled in the tank and then</v>

1664
01:20:26.581 --> 01:20:31.581
<v Speaker 2>just completely concentrate on my breath</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just just concentrate entirely on</v>

1665
01:20:32.011 --> 01:20:35.970
<v Speaker 2>the breathing in and breathing out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>get it into this almost like hypnotic</v>

1666
01:20:35.971 --> 01:20:38.760
<v Speaker 2>cycle of breathing in and breathing out.</v>

1667
01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:41.910
<v Speaker 2>And it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be all these different</v>

1668
01:20:41.911 --> 01:20:42.880
<v Speaker 2>thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a,</v>

1669
01:20:42.890 --> 01:20:43.651
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm itchy.</v>

1670
01:20:43.651 --> 01:20:45.830
<v Speaker 2>I should scratch my nose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

1671
01:20:45.831 --> 01:20:48.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I should cut this down to an hour</v>

1672
01:20:48.661 --> 01:20:51.480
<v Speaker 2>instead of two hours like I planned or</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1673
01:20:51.481 --> 01:20:54.120
<v Speaker 2>I really need to go running instead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to yoga tomorrow,</v>

1674
01:20:54.121 --> 01:20:56.610
<v Speaker 2>maybe I should switch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to let those go.</v>

1675
01:20:56.700 --> 01:21:00.150
<v Speaker 2>They come in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they come out and just the breathing</v>

1676
01:21:00.151 --> 01:21:03.510
<v Speaker 2>being this consistent thing that I can</v>
<v Speaker 2>always go back to concentrating on.</v>

1677
01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:05.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is,</v>

1678
01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:08.750
<v Speaker 1>that's it you just described.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a practice almost exactly like</v>

1679
01:21:08.751 --> 01:21:12.020
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It actually enhances the tank.</v>

1680
01:21:12.021 --> 01:21:12.831
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>

1681
01:21:12.831 --> 01:21:16.730
<v Speaker 1>I was just going to say that I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out what I was noticing</v>

1682
01:21:16.731 --> 01:21:18.800
<v Speaker 1>my breath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what am I noticing here?</v>

1683
01:21:18.801 --> 01:21:20.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might actually feeling the breath or</v>

1684
01:21:20.321 --> 01:21:25.321
<v Speaker 1>might just hearing the breath come in</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the nose and just identifying</v>

1685
01:21:25.401 --> 01:21:27.050
<v Speaker 1>that was actually a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

1686
01:21:27.051 --> 01:21:30.770
<v Speaker 1>It actually boosted my level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to the breath when I decided</v>

1687
01:21:30.771 --> 01:21:32.000
<v Speaker 1>to go in that direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1688
01:21:32.001 --> 01:21:32.834
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1689
01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:34.021
<v Speaker 2>it's both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1690
01:21:34.021 --> 01:21:35.400
<v Speaker 2>you're hearing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're feeling it,</v>

1691
01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:37.740
<v Speaker 2>but it's just the act of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1692
01:21:37.741 --> 01:21:40.620
<v Speaker 2>the thing that doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing it and they're like this</v>

1693
01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:45.830
<v Speaker 2>sort of like hypnotic in and out thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happens when you have no sensory</v>

1694
01:21:47.071 --> 01:21:49.440
<v Speaker 2>input whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not feeling your feet on the</v>

1695
01:21:49.441 --> 01:21:50.850
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel weightless.</v>

1696
01:21:50.851 --> 01:21:52.860
<v Speaker 2>You're not hearing anything and not</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing anything.</v>

1697
01:21:53.130 --> 01:21:56.970
<v Speaker 2>It's just a particularly effective</v>
<v Speaker 2>environment for exploring your.</v>

1698
01:21:57.490 --> 01:22:01.410
<v Speaker 1>There's an expression sometimes this</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling of our inexperience of being</v>

1699
01:22:01.411 --> 01:22:03.390
<v Speaker 1>breezed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like you're not.</v>

1700
01:22:03.391 --> 01:22:06.330
<v Speaker 1>You're no longer doing the breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The breathing is just happening.</v>

1701
01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:09.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're being breathed by a</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant cosmic lung.</v>

1702
01:22:11.250 --> 01:22:12.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>

1703
01:22:12.781 --> 01:22:16.920
<v Speaker 1>that feeling that you're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>letting go try to do that in the tank</v>

1704
01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:20.250
<v Speaker 1>and it's just like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just let go of any sense of that.</v>

1705
01:22:20.251 --> 01:22:23.910
<v Speaker 1>There's a dewar and it just that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just start to taste yourself as this</v>

1706
01:22:23.911 --> 01:22:27.030
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing that's just happening,</v>

1707
01:22:27.031 --> 01:22:29.340
<v Speaker 1>you know in a bird is passing outside.</v>

1708
01:22:29.950 --> 01:22:33.160
<v Speaker 2>Clouds are passing and someone's walking</v>
<v Speaker 2>across the street talking on their phone</v>

1709
01:22:33.161 --> 01:22:38.161
<v Speaker 2>and you're being breathed and it's all</v>
<v Speaker 2>just one system that's just happening.</v>

1710
01:22:39.190 --> 01:22:41.050
<v Speaker 2>It's also interesting too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm in the tank,</v>

1711
01:22:41.051 --> 01:22:45.540
<v Speaker 2>I lose the sense of what is up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's down here.</v>

1712
01:22:45.550 --> 01:22:49.330
<v Speaker 2>Like you lose like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're lying there and you're</v>

1713
01:22:49.331 --> 01:22:51.280
<v Speaker 2>floating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of lose this.</v>

1714
01:22:51.310 --> 01:22:53.620
<v Speaker 2>Everything seems like all over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>

1715
01:22:53.710 --> 01:22:57.700
<v Speaker 2>but in the thought of relaxing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>letting go,</v>

1716
01:22:57.701 --> 01:23:00.250
<v Speaker 2>it's always going down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always like a deeper thing.</v>

1717
01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:03.490
<v Speaker 2>It's always like settling in more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>settling more.</v>

1718
01:23:03.491 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 2>It always seems to go towards back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're</v>

1719
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:09.190
<v Speaker 4>just sinking in deeper and deeper and</v>
<v Speaker 4>deeper.</v>

1720
01:23:09.191 --> 01:23:12.820
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the only times we have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>sensation of a very particular direction</v>

1721
01:23:12.821 --> 01:23:13.480
<v Speaker 4>that you're going in.</v>

1722
01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:16.930
<v Speaker 3>I found that direction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listening of it that initially was quite</v>

1723
01:23:16.931 --> 01:23:21.760
<v Speaker 3>scary for me that I was aware it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my moving or is this inner ear</v>

1724
01:23:21.761 --> 01:23:22.850
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1725
01:23:22.851 --> 01:23:26.080
<v Speaker 3>like it was just flying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1726
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:28.690
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't experience that as a soaring.</v>

1727
01:23:28.691 --> 01:23:31.150
<v Speaker 3>I experienced it as more terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do we,</v>

1728
01:23:31.530 --> 01:23:35.710
<v Speaker 3>do we do we have footage of Dan Klein</v>
<v Speaker 3>the inside of the tank?</v>

1729
01:23:36.650 --> 01:23:37.840
<v Speaker 3>It's a practice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1730
01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:38.231
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1731
01:23:38.231 --> 01:23:40.810
<v Speaker 3>I see the value.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1732
01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:45.100
<v Speaker 3>another thing that actually kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>reminds me of my last meditation retreat</v>

1733
01:23:45.101 --> 01:23:46.990
<v Speaker 3>where we're talking about physical</v>
<v Speaker 3>discomfort.</v>

1734
01:23:46.991 --> 01:23:50.050
<v Speaker 3>My teacher and I and because I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>experiencing a lot of physical pain from</v>

1735
01:23:50.051 --> 01:23:53.560
<v Speaker 3>long sitting for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pain comes up and I was asking,</v>

1736
01:23:53.561 --> 01:23:55.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it okay for me to quit at some point</v>

1737
01:23:55.890 --> 01:23:58.240
<v Speaker 3>just because it's pains too intense?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And He.</v>

1738
01:23:58.450 --> 01:23:59.650
<v Speaker 3>Joseph was arguing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1739
01:23:59.651 --> 01:24:02.290
<v Speaker 3>I think you want to test your limits on</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1740
01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:04.150
<v Speaker 3>Obviously at some point you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get up,</v>

1741
01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:05.880
<v Speaker 3>but you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

1742
01:24:05.930 --> 01:24:10.930
<v Speaker 3>we're gradually increasing the amount</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we can stand and that to me seems</v>

1743
01:24:12.910 --> 01:24:16.870
<v Speaker 3>very similar to the value that I can</v>
<v Speaker 3>perceive of getting back in the sensory</v>

1744
01:24:16.871 --> 01:24:21.871
<v Speaker 3>deprivation tank of being able to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>with that fear a little bit more,</v>

1745
01:24:22.031 --> 01:24:25.510
<v Speaker 3>test the limit a little bit more</v>
<v Speaker 3>consistently so that I'm a so that my</v>

1746
01:24:25.511 --> 01:24:26.620
<v Speaker 3>world isn't getting smaller.</v>

1747
01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:29.410
<v Speaker 4>People echo that same sentiment when it</v>
<v Speaker 4>comes to psychedelics.</v>

1748
01:24:29.970 --> 01:24:33.140
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the next test for belonging,</v>

1749
01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:34.470
<v Speaker 3>very interested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of,</v>

1750
01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:38.310
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's been a growing body of research</v>

1751
01:24:38.311 --> 01:24:42.630
<v Speaker 3>into the salutary effects of</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics and a lot of it's being</v>

1752
01:24:42.631 --> 01:24:46.170
<v Speaker 3>done at Nyu on cancer cancer patients</v>
<v Speaker 3>who have anxiety,</v>

1753
01:24:46.171 --> 01:24:49.710
<v Speaker 3>but there's also some specific work</v>
<v Speaker 3>being done at Johns Hopkins on</v>

1754
01:24:49.711 --> 01:24:52.530
<v Speaker 3>meditators and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and psilocybin.</v>

1755
01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:56.490
<v Speaker 3>What kind of effect to psilocybin have</v>
<v Speaker 3>on meditators and in Kenya in a way,</v>

1756
01:24:56.491 --> 01:25:00.420
<v Speaker 3>show them directionally where you want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be moving in your meditative</v>

1757
01:25:00.421 --> 01:25:03.600
<v Speaker 3>practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've had a longstanding desire to</v>

1758
01:25:03.601 --> 01:25:08.601
<v Speaker 3>get into this study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my shrink and my wife strongly argue</v>

1759
01:25:09.151 --> 01:25:12.420
<v Speaker 3>that I shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody with my kind of brain chemistry</v>

1760
01:25:12.421 --> 01:25:14.970
<v Speaker 3>who had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has to go on and perform under pressure</v>

1761
01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:17.190
<v Speaker 3>when the red light's on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on TV.</v>

1762
01:25:17.460 --> 01:25:20.820
<v Speaker 3>Probably not a great idea to dose myself</v>
<v Speaker 3>with psychedelics,</v>

1763
01:25:20.821 --> 01:25:22.590
<v Speaker 3>but this is something that I've been</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestling with.</v>

1764
01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:25.390
<v Speaker 3>What are you worried about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What that looks like?</v>

1765
01:25:25.550 --> 01:25:28.380
<v Speaker 3>What do you think is gonna happen is</v>
<v Speaker 3>right back to the.</v>

1766
01:25:28.381 --> 01:25:30.720
<v Speaker 3>My worries in the tank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Timmy,</v>

1767
01:25:30.721 --> 01:25:32.940
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking a lot about psychedelics</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've had,</v>

1768
01:25:32.941 --> 01:25:34.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was a kid and,</v>

1769
01:25:34.350 --> 01:25:36.360
<v Speaker 3>and would smoke weed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have panic attacks.</v>

1770
01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:40.140
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's about the desire for</v>
<v Speaker 3>control of the ego.</v>

1771
01:25:40.141 --> 01:25:42.380
<v Speaker 3>The thinking mind moves is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

1772
01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:44.700
<v Speaker 3>it's like a vampire confronted with</v>
<v Speaker 3>garlic,</v>

1773
01:25:44.701 --> 01:25:48.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just my ego's spoiling and can't</v>

1774
01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:51.150
<v Speaker 3>handle the lack of control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not just the entity energy</v>

1775
01:25:51.150 --> 01:25:54.330
<v Speaker 4>of those experiences that's so intense</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you just have no control over it,</v>

1776
01:25:54.331 --> 01:25:56.970
<v Speaker 4>but it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just blows apart your worldview.</v>

1777
01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:59.070
<v Speaker 4>Like you had this idea that you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1778
01:25:59.071 --> 01:26:00.630
<v Speaker 4>you think you know what's really going</v>
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

1779
01:26:00.631 --> 01:26:02.670
<v Speaker 4>and then you have one of those</v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences and it just shows you that</v>

1780
01:26:02.671 --> 01:26:04.140
<v Speaker 4>you don't anything well</v>

1781
01:26:04.140 --> 01:26:06.350
<v Speaker 3>and you are there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think you are,</v>

1782
01:26:06.351 --> 01:26:09.710
<v Speaker 3>you that there's some solid you there</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that that is called into question</v>

1783
01:26:09.711 --> 01:26:10.320
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally.</v>

1784
01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's humbling to be shown that all</v>

1785
01:26:13.831 --> 01:26:15.450
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your ideas about how you think things</v>

1786
01:26:15.451 --> 01:26:20.100
<v Speaker 1>are just that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's just like that you don't know.</v>

1787
01:26:20.101 --> 01:26:22.260
<v Speaker 1>Fuck all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that has been,</v>

1788
01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:24.270
<v Speaker 1>that's my experience from doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that stuff.</v>

1789
01:26:24.271 --> 01:26:27.390
<v Speaker 1>It's like I just shows me that I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

1790
01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:32.420
<v Speaker 1>Just sit back to sit back and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and let nature do what nature's going to</v>

1791
01:26:32.791 --> 01:26:33.490
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1792
01:26:33.490 --> 01:26:35.710
<v Speaker 3>Can you say sit back dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when there's no dude there,</v>

1793
01:26:35.770 --> 01:26:39.400
<v Speaker 1>when that's what you're starting to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get exploded.</v>

1794
01:26:39.401 --> 01:26:42.400
<v Speaker 1>So it basically you're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a win win situation.</v>

1795
01:26:42.730 --> 01:26:45.940
<v Speaker 1>Either you win because you're able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay super aquinas with a greater and</v>

1796
01:26:45.941 --> 01:26:48.940
<v Speaker 1>greater intensity of what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing under a trip or you win</v>

1797
01:26:48.941 --> 01:26:52.540
<v Speaker 1>because you don't stay economists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fight with it and you get ripped to</v>

1798
01:26:52.541 --> 01:26:57.541
<v Speaker 1>shreds and in that humbling moment you</v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't itself is deeply consoling</v>

1799
01:26:58.841 --> 01:27:01.900
<v Speaker 1>and healing both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like both sides of that are</v>

1800
01:27:01.970 --> 01:27:04.270
<v Speaker 1>are positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a net positive gain on both</v>

1801
01:27:04.271 --> 01:27:06.800
<v Speaker 1>sides of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I legitimated you know,</v>

1802
01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:08.100
<v Speaker 1>when I'm getting ripped apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1803
01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:11.760
<v Speaker 1>Getting ripped apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1804
01:27:11.761 --> 01:27:14.010
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See you see what I'm worried about.</v>

1805
01:27:14.150 --> 01:27:15.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm worried about.</v>

1806
01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:18.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was just relax.</v>

1807
01:27:18.151 --> 01:27:18.770
<v Speaker 1>It'll be fun.</v>

1808
01:27:18.770 --> 01:27:19.401
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

1809
01:27:19.401 --> 01:27:21.020
<v Speaker 3>but that's one of those things like get</v>
<v Speaker 3>it onto your.</v>

1810
01:27:21.021 --> 01:27:25.580
<v Speaker 3>When people say relaxed or get out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>your own way for somebody as tightly</v>

1811
01:27:25.581 --> 01:27:28.310
<v Speaker 3>wound as me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a frustrating thing to hear because</v>

1812
01:27:28.311 --> 01:27:29.130
<v Speaker 3>it's hard for me to have</v>

1813
01:27:29.130 --> 01:27:33.300
<v Speaker 1>racial gotta resist that clench.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Resist the clench.</v>

1814
01:27:33.301 --> 01:27:37.830
<v Speaker 1>Just let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you do get ripped apart.</v>

1815
01:27:37.980 --> 01:27:38.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh you.</v>

1816
01:27:38.551 --> 01:27:42.030
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time if you do it right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heroes dose.</v>

1817
01:27:42.110 --> 01:27:44.470
<v Speaker 1>So that's part of the thing about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

1818
01:27:44.471 --> 01:27:47.160
<v Speaker 1>is you're supposed to thing heroes does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terence Mckenna?</v>

1819
01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:48.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1820
01:27:48.211 --> 01:27:53.211
<v Speaker 1>I got five dried grams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was seven to seven if you're</v>

1821
01:27:55.050 --> 01:27:57.480
<v Speaker 1>interested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but five dried grams is the recommended</v>

1822
01:27:57.481 --> 01:27:58.620
<v Speaker 1>threshold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1823
01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:00.360
<v Speaker 1>That's a different kind of emotional</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

1824
01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:01.223
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1825
01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:02.133
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1826
01:28:02.410 --> 01:28:04.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's one of those things where</v>

1827
01:28:05.330 --> 01:28:10.330
<v Speaker 1>if you test yourself slowly but surely</v>
<v Speaker 1>in those waters,</v>

1828
01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:15.050
<v Speaker 1>you'll get more and more accustomed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the feeling of relaxation and letting go</v>

1829
01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:18.200
<v Speaker 1>and that treat it like it's a shamonic</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

1830
01:28:18.201 --> 01:28:23.201
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a very deep intensive search</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the very meaning of your existence</v>

1831
01:28:25.581 --> 01:28:27.350
<v Speaker 1>and don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think of it as like,</v>

1832
01:28:27.410 --> 01:28:29.570
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm about to do drugs.</v>

1833
01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:32.140
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

1834
01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:34.360
<v Speaker 3>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not dissimilar in the way that</v>

1835
01:28:34.390 --> 01:28:39.370
<v Speaker 3>when you don't know up from down when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have no sensation of your body</v>

1836
01:28:39.371 --> 01:28:43.510
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is exposing the fundamental,</v>

1837
01:28:44.260 --> 01:28:49.240
<v Speaker 3>the fundamental fact that Jeff has.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeff has used as this description over</v>

1838
01:28:49.241 --> 01:28:51.520
<v Speaker 3>and over I think quite beautifully</v>
<v Speaker 3>throughout this discussion,</v>

1839
01:28:51.521 --> 01:28:54.190
<v Speaker 3>which is that we aren't as solid as we</v>
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>

1840
01:28:54.191 --> 01:28:55.024
<v Speaker 3>We are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1841
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:59.590
<v Speaker 3>a process and the dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to console the dude.</v>

1842
01:28:59.591 --> 01:29:04.320
<v Speaker 3>It's okay that dude or do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no there,</v>

1843
01:29:04.321 --> 01:29:08.700
<v Speaker 3>there and that I could see myself going</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that direction in the tank that's</v>

1844
01:29:08.701 --> 01:29:12.000
<v Speaker 3>inexorably where it takes you and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>is where psychedelics take you.</v>

1845
01:29:12.001 --> 01:29:13.800
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in,</v>

1846
01:29:13.950 --> 01:29:15.570
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in this weird position because I'm</v>

1847
01:29:15.690 --> 01:29:20.270
<v Speaker 3>deeply interested in that experience and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've tasted in my own meditation for</v>

1848
01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:22.620
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So scared.</v>

1849
01:29:22.650 --> 01:29:24.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is where meditation goes.</v>

1850
01:29:24.230 --> 01:29:28.260
<v Speaker 3>If we're seeing that your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the you,</v>

1851
01:29:28.261 --> 01:29:33.261
<v Speaker 3>that you've been defending and</v>
<v Speaker 3>protecting since sentience actually</v>

1852
01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:39.320
<v Speaker 3>doesn't exist is I think ultimately very</v>
<v Speaker 3>liberating really is the true</v>

1853
01:29:39.331 --> 01:29:43.890
<v Speaker 3>liberation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But seeing it initially as a,</v>

1854
01:29:44.130 --> 01:29:45.230
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1855
01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:49.620
<v Speaker 3>as a newbie is it tears apart as Jeff</v>
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>

1856
01:29:49.621 --> 01:29:51.010
<v Speaker 3>your worldview,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>

1857
01:29:51.050 --> 01:29:54.240
<v Speaker 3>our worldview is based on us at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>center.</v>

1858
01:29:54.300 --> 01:29:56.130
<v Speaker 3>It's a death experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1859
01:29:56.220 --> 01:29:56.700
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1860
01:29:56.700 --> 01:29:59.820
<v Speaker 4>So it seems to me it's like you want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>learn how to swim,</v>

1861
01:29:59.850 --> 01:30:03.870
<v Speaker 4>but you really only interested in calf</v>
<v Speaker 4>high water because if you,</v>

1862
01:30:04.050 --> 01:30:07.560
<v Speaker 4>if you really want to learn how to swim,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happens is they take you out on a</v>

1863
01:30:07.561 --> 01:30:10.800
<v Speaker 4>jet ski to the middle of the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They go jump off,</v>

1864
01:30:10.801 --> 01:30:11.830
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1865
01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:13.890
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're now in the center of the ocean</v>

1866
01:30:13.891 --> 01:30:17.730
<v Speaker 4>and that's the psychedelic trip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The psychedelic trip is you are fucking</v>

1867
01:30:17.731 --> 01:30:19.010
<v Speaker 4>swimming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1868
01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:20.580
<v Speaker 4>There's no if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ands,</v>

1869
01:30:20.581 --> 01:30:22.650
<v Speaker 4>or buts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You must keep going or you're going to</v>

1870
01:30:22.651 --> 01:30:23.470
<v Speaker 4>drown.</v>

1871
01:30:23.470 --> 01:30:27.760
<v Speaker 3>I think there are different approaches</v>
<v Speaker 3>based on different people because I</v>

1872
01:30:27.761 --> 01:30:29.830
<v Speaker 3>think you're exactly right that I want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to swim,</v>

1873
01:30:29.831 --> 01:30:32.560
<v Speaker 3>but my tendency is to stick to the CAF</v>
<v Speaker 3>high water,</v>

1874
01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:37.540
<v Speaker 3>but you're from what I know about you</v>
<v Speaker 3>having spent a little bit of time with</v>

1875
01:30:37.541 --> 01:30:40.540
<v Speaker 3>you and just follow following you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're kind of a baller,</v>

1876
01:30:40.541 --> 01:30:44.740
<v Speaker 3>like you're ready to go out on the jet</v>
<v Speaker 3>ski and jump in or do all this crazy</v>

1877
01:30:44.741 --> 01:30:46.330
<v Speaker 3>stuff that traditionally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1878
01:30:46.331 --> 01:30:48.400
<v Speaker 3>I have done some crazy things that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>discussed,</v>

1879
01:30:48.401 --> 01:30:51.700
<v Speaker 3>but traditionally I'm more cautious and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think for somebody with my kind of</v>

1880
01:30:51.701 --> 01:30:54.240
<v Speaker 3>brain chemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody whose brain is very good at</v>

1881
01:30:54.250 --> 01:30:56.230
<v Speaker 3>panicking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a more step wise</v>

1882
01:30:56.231 --> 01:30:58.270
<v Speaker 3>approach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what I'm intrigued by,</v>

1883
01:30:58.271 --> 01:30:59.830
<v Speaker 3>which is what we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we keep discussing,</v>

1884
01:30:59.831 --> 01:31:02.830
<v Speaker 3>which is test those limits time and</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1885
01:31:02.980 --> 01:31:04.270
<v Speaker 3>keep testing them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't,</v>

1886
01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:05.410
<v Speaker 3>don't let up.</v>

1887
01:31:05.410 --> 01:31:06.490
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1888
01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:08.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my shrink,</v>

1889
01:31:08.860 --> 01:31:13.060
<v Speaker 3>the one who got me to stop doing drugs</v>
<v Speaker 3>after I had a panic attack on television</v>

1890
01:31:13.090 --> 01:31:15.500
<v Speaker 3>and helped me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1891
01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:18.910
<v Speaker 3>Kinda straighten myself out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a panic attack or the beginnings</v>

1892
01:31:18.911 --> 01:31:22.810
<v Speaker 3>of a panic attack on a subway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm about five years ago.</v>

1893
01:31:23.140 --> 01:31:24.160
<v Speaker 3>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

1894
01:31:24.161 --> 01:31:27.100
<v Speaker 3>it was devastating because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is such a setback.</v>

1895
01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:29.000
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm right back at stage one.</v>

1896
01:31:29.001 --> 01:31:30.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm and my world is gonna get smaller</v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

1897
01:31:30.731 --> 01:31:34.690
<v Speaker 3>So I went to go see him kind of on an</v>
<v Speaker 3>emergent basis and he laid out a plan,</v>

1898
01:31:34.691 --> 01:31:38.920
<v Speaker 3>which is not his original idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is actually the way you treat these</v>

1899
01:31:38.921 --> 01:31:41.230
<v Speaker 3>things called exposure therapy where he</v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

1900
01:31:41.231 --> 01:31:42.910
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here for the next 10 days I want you to</v>

1901
01:31:42.911 --> 01:31:47.170
<v Speaker 3>go stand on the subway platform every</v>
<v Speaker 3>day just for a couple of minutes.</v>

1902
01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:52.210
<v Speaker 3>And then for the 10 days after that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want you to get on a subway or a car</v>

1903
01:31:52.690 --> 01:31:55.420
<v Speaker 3>and then get off before the door closes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

1904
01:31:55.450 --> 01:31:58.360
<v Speaker 3>five to 10 days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then after that I want you to get on</v>

1905
01:31:58.450 --> 01:32:01.690
<v Speaker 3>and go one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And basically he got me back on the</v>

1906
01:32:01.691 --> 01:32:05.110
<v Speaker 3>subway because I was able to gradually</v>
<v Speaker 3>get through.</v>

1907
01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:09.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm not Joe Rogan from my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would never be able to host a show</v>

1908
01:32:09.341 --> 01:32:11.760
<v Speaker 3>called fear factor the way you did with</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1909
01:32:11.761 --> 01:32:14.470
<v Speaker 3>unless it was a completely different</v>
<v Speaker 3>show where you know,</v>

1910
01:32:14.471 --> 01:32:17.260
<v Speaker 3>you're not getting in a tank full of</v>
<v Speaker 3>torrential is on the first day,</v>

1911
01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:19.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to do in a step wise progression</v>

1912
01:32:19.751 --> 01:32:21.280
<v Speaker 3>because that's the way my brain is</v>
<v Speaker 3>wired.</v>

1913
01:32:21.870 --> 01:32:22.450
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

1914
01:32:22.450 --> 01:32:25.990
<v Speaker 1>To me that there's going to be different</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways for folks to do it.</v>

1915
01:32:26.050 --> 01:32:31.050
<v Speaker 1>They're definitely as did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were you exposed to a lot of difficulty</v>

1916
01:32:31.751 --> 01:32:34.570
<v Speaker 1>when you were young?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you have to overcome physical</v>

1917
01:32:34.571 --> 01:32:37.570
<v Speaker 1>adversity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you participate in any one on one</v>

1918
01:32:37.571 --> 01:32:38.000
<v Speaker 1>sport</v>

1919
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.730
<v Speaker 3>or anything like that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the problem was just the</v>

1920
01:32:39.731 --> 01:32:43.420
<v Speaker 3>opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I had two incredibly loving former</v>

1921
01:32:43.421 --> 01:32:48.421
<v Speaker 3>hippie parents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a bit of a spoiled kid and Jeff</v>

1922
01:32:48.431 --> 01:32:49.500
<v Speaker 3>and I have talked about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1923
01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:52.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the extent that I experienced anger</v>

1924
01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:54.650
<v Speaker 3>or frustration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1925
01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:57.130
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because I'm not getting what I</v>

1926
01:32:57.131 --> 01:32:59.170
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1927
01:32:59.350 --> 01:33:02.560
<v Speaker 3>But I did do some competitive sports.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just wasn't very good at it.</v>

1928
01:33:03.450 --> 01:33:06.060
<v Speaker 1>So do you guys have you guys heard of</v>
<v Speaker 1>somatic experiencing?</v>

1929
01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:11.700
<v Speaker 1>So sematic experiencing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the super interesting a way of</v>

1930
01:33:12.001 --> 01:33:15.690
<v Speaker 1>addressing trauma that is starting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get really influential in the body work</v>

1931
01:33:15.691 --> 01:33:19.740
<v Speaker 1>community and psychotherapists and</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychiatrists and psychologists are</v>

1932
01:33:19.741 --> 01:33:22.440
<v Speaker 1>starting to look at it and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of good papers out about it,</v>

1933
01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:26.850
<v Speaker 1>but basically the thesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes from being really a guy named</v>

1934
01:33:26.851 --> 01:33:29.580
<v Speaker 1>Peter Levine who spent a lot of time</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at animal behavior.</v>

1935
01:33:30.060 --> 01:33:34.260
<v Speaker 1>And what he noticed is that when animal</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes into a fight or flight situation,</v>

1936
01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:35.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

1937
01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:39.600
<v Speaker 1>So you're a gazelle and all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the tiger and then you go,</v>

1938
01:33:39.601 --> 01:33:42.750
<v Speaker 1>you just exploded to action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's this explosive release of</v>

1939
01:33:42.751 --> 01:33:46.500
<v Speaker 1>energy running or fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is afterwards,</v>

1940
01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:49.560
<v Speaker 1>they'll often go into this shaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect where they'll start trembling.</v>

1941
01:33:49.690 --> 01:33:52.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm unconsciously or they can't control</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1942
01:33:52.170 --> 01:33:54.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what they think is that it's like</v>

1943
01:33:54.541 --> 01:33:57.810
<v Speaker 1>discharging all the excess energy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they go back to homeostasis.</v>

1944
01:33:58.140 --> 01:34:02.160
<v Speaker 1>And so his theory is that what happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>with human beings is because we have</v>

1945
01:34:02.161 --> 01:34:05.460
<v Speaker 1>these giant frontal lobes that we get</v>
<v Speaker 1>shocks to our nervous system,</v>

1946
01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:08.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we can't discharge the energy.</v>

1947
01:34:08.850 --> 01:34:12.660
<v Speaker 1>We can't fucking punch your boss in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>face or we can't run or whatever.</v>

1948
01:34:12.661 --> 01:34:14.790
<v Speaker 1>And just the same as when we were kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just swallow it up.</v>

1949
01:34:14.791 --> 01:34:17.310
<v Speaker 1>We swallowed up and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that trapped energy,</v>

1950
01:34:17.311 --> 01:34:20.520
<v Speaker 1>the nervous system starts to become our</v>
<v Speaker 1>neurotic habits.</v>

1951
01:34:20.521 --> 01:34:24.630
<v Speaker 1>It becomes chronic anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes a panic attacks.</v>

1952
01:34:24.631 --> 01:34:27.750
<v Speaker 1>It becomes chronic aggression or</v>
<v Speaker 1>irritability.</v>

1953
01:34:27.930 --> 01:34:30.150
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chronic freeze responses get stuck in</v>

1954
01:34:30.151 --> 01:34:31.650
<v Speaker 1>there too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of like chronic,</v>

1955
01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:34.260
<v Speaker 1>not their illness or someone who sort a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit dreamy.</v>

1956
01:34:34.710 --> 01:34:37.470
<v Speaker 1>And so somatic experiencing is a whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>way of working with it.</v>

1957
01:34:37.470 --> 01:34:39.990
<v Speaker 1>We're basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like exposure therapy,</v>

1958
01:34:40.260 --> 01:34:41.071
<v Speaker 1>but it wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

1959
01:34:41.071 --> 01:34:42.920
<v Speaker 1>it's not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's all in the,</v>

1960
01:34:43.110 --> 01:34:44.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very meditative.</v>

1961
01:34:44.881 --> 01:34:46.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're working with somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

1962
01:34:46.711 --> 01:34:48.240
<v Speaker 1>and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1963
01:34:48.241 --> 01:34:50.670
<v Speaker 1>why are you coming to the awardee feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable sitting?</v>

1964
01:34:50.671 --> 01:34:51.091
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1965
01:34:51.091 --> 01:34:52.650
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel a couple of sitting over here.</v>

1966
01:34:52.651 --> 01:34:54.660
<v Speaker 1>Why did you sit there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1967
01:34:54.661 --> 01:34:56.340
<v Speaker 1>I kinda like had my back to the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1968
01:34:56.341 --> 01:34:58.370
<v Speaker 1>what is it about having your back to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wall that makes you feel more</v>

1969
01:34:58.371 --> 01:35:00.680
<v Speaker 1>comfortable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just feel this and it's like,</v>

1970
01:35:00.681 --> 01:35:02.600
<v Speaker 1>well then what's the opposite?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the discomfortable thing?</v>

1971
01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:03.810
<v Speaker 1>And then you and you notice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1972
01:35:03.811 --> 01:35:06.230
<v Speaker 1>what it would feel like to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable there and you basically</v>

1973
01:35:06.231 --> 01:35:11.030
<v Speaker 1>find a spot in your experience and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness which is very centered and</v>

1974
01:35:11.031 --> 01:35:14.780
<v Speaker 1>comfortable and then you find that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem and you try to simultaneously</v>

1975
01:35:14.781 --> 01:35:18.830
<v Speaker 1>notice both at the same time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically all the trapped energy of the</v>

1976
01:35:18.831 --> 01:35:21.500
<v Speaker 1>neurotic place starts to drain out that</v>
<v Speaker 1>making sense.</v>

1977
01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:23.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to make it visually vivid or</v>
<v Speaker 1>visual,</v>

1978
01:35:23.571 --> 01:35:27.950
<v Speaker 1>but that's how you work with this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can start to drain out these</v>

1979
01:35:28.010 --> 01:35:30.530
<v Speaker 1>patterns of like chronic fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These paddocks of,</v>

1980
01:35:30.620 --> 01:35:32.450
<v Speaker 1>of chronic fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do it,</v>

1981
01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:35.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by noticing how that pattern is in your</v>

1982
01:35:35.181 --> 01:35:38.120
<v Speaker 1>body connecting to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it can kinda empty out.</v>

1983
01:35:38.330 --> 01:35:40.910
<v Speaker 1>It's so interesting because it also</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

1984
01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:43.610
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it blows the lid off trauma.</v>

1985
01:35:43.611 --> 01:35:46.330
<v Speaker 1>It says trauma is going to be different</v>
<v Speaker 1>for every person.</v>

1986
01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:48.350
<v Speaker 1>All traumas is just shock to the nervous</v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

1987
01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:52.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not just about surviving a</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorist attack or you know,</v>

1988
01:35:52.341 --> 01:35:55.280
<v Speaker 1>all this horrible stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like someone might do something to</v>

1989
01:35:55.281 --> 01:35:57.920
<v Speaker 1>Dan in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the smallest way when he's a two year</v>

1990
01:35:57.921 --> 01:35:59.840
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't any big deal,</v>

1991
01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:03.710
<v Speaker 1>but it completely freaked him out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It basically shocked his nervous system</v>

1992
01:36:03.711 --> 01:36:07.560
<v Speaker 1>so intensely that now there's that</v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern of shock that's in there that</v>

1993
01:36:07.561 --> 01:36:08.480
<v Speaker 1>still lives in there.</v>

1994
01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:11.390
<v Speaker 1>And what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just grows and grows and grows and</v>

1995
01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:12.770
<v Speaker 1>because if you don't release that</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy,</v>

1996
01:36:12.771 --> 01:36:15.680
<v Speaker 1>it just just keeps causing havoc in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

1997
01:36:16.100 --> 01:36:18.170
<v Speaker 1>That's the thinking of somatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing.</v>

1998
01:36:18.171 --> 01:36:19.940
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've been working with somebody and</v>

1999
01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:21.350
<v Speaker 1>I had a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2000
01:36:21.351 --> 01:36:22.700
<v Speaker 1>just to give him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make it real.</v>

2001
01:36:23.150 --> 01:36:25.160
<v Speaker 1>I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had a lot of injuries in my life,</v>

2002
01:36:25.161 --> 01:36:28.700
<v Speaker 1>like broken neck and broke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>busted shoulder and different things</v>

2003
01:36:28.701 --> 01:36:31.940
<v Speaker 1>from just being a jackass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one time I got hit by this truck,</v>

2004
01:36:32.270 --> 01:36:34.520
<v Speaker 1>I was on my bike and it blew up my</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder,</v>

2005
01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:36.100
<v Speaker 1>hit the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then uh,</v>

2006
01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:37.153
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2007
01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:40.340
<v Speaker 1>back of the truck hit me and he has sent</v>
<v Speaker 1>me spinning.</v>

2008
01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:42.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so one time I was in there working</v>

2009
01:36:42.771 --> 01:36:45.330
<v Speaker 1>with the somatic experiencing lady and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

2010
01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:47.540
<v Speaker 1>what direction do you want to look in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2011
01:36:47.590 --> 01:36:48.401
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of felt like,</v>

2012
01:36:48.401 --> 01:36:50.810
<v Speaker 1>look in this way if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't feel like looking that way.</v>

2013
01:36:50.810 --> 01:36:51.810
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2014
01:36:52.060 --> 01:36:53.840
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really want to turn my head this</v>

2015
01:36:53.841 --> 01:36:55.210
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really want it.</v>

2016
01:36:55.220 --> 01:36:57.680
<v Speaker 1>And I realized that that's always there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kinda don't want to look this way.</v>

2017
01:36:58.190 --> 01:36:58.761
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2018
01:36:58.761 --> 01:37:00.170
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens when you look this way?</v>

2019
01:37:00.171 --> 01:37:01.010
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

2020
01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:04.610
<v Speaker 1>I started looking this way and was</v>
<v Speaker 1>harder do and suddenly I remembered the</v>

2021
01:37:05.050 --> 01:37:10.050
<v Speaker 1>impact of this truck from when I was 17</v>
<v Speaker 1>years old on this side of my body and I</v>

2022
01:37:10.281 --> 01:37:15.281
<v Speaker 1>could feel that the impact was still in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my body and she got me to work to turn</v>

2023
01:37:16.401 --> 01:37:18.350
<v Speaker 1>my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like she got me to connect to that,</v>

2024
01:37:18.380 --> 01:37:20.360
<v Speaker 1>to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm thinking of that memory and I'm</v>

2025
01:37:20.361 --> 01:37:24.710
<v Speaker 1>feeling that memory in my body and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets me to work through that turning my</v>

2026
01:37:24.711 --> 01:37:28.550
<v Speaker 1>head and the act of doing that was like</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden</v>

2027
01:37:30.110 --> 01:37:33.170
<v Speaker 1>I felt all this new freedom in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern and I have now not had that</v>

2028
01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:35.840
<v Speaker 1>issue as much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's just to give you an example</v>

2029
01:37:35.841 --> 01:37:38.200
<v Speaker 1>of how you would work in that mode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that.</v>

2030
01:37:38.230 --> 01:37:39.320
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that cool?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2031
01:37:39.321 --> 01:37:41.630
<v Speaker 1>I find that to unbelievably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do too.</v>

2032
01:37:41.900 --> 01:37:45.170
<v Speaker 1>That is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listening to your story about your life,</v>

2033
01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:49.850
<v Speaker 1>about the lack of difficulty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sort of reinforces my ideas about</v>

2034
01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:55.120
<v Speaker 1>martial arts and that it's not about</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning how to be a great fighter</v>

2035
01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:00.450
<v Speaker 4>learning on the beat people up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's learning how to battle your own</v>

2036
01:38:00.451 --> 01:38:05.451
<v Speaker 4>internal demons and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and confront insecurities and fears and</v>

2037
01:38:05.641 --> 01:38:10.641
<v Speaker 4>to do it on a regular basis frees up a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of the mental landscape.</v>

2038
01:38:11.700 --> 01:38:16.500
<v Speaker 4>It allows you to just be more relaxed</v>
<v Speaker 4>about a lot of different approaches to</v>

2039
01:38:16.501 --> 01:38:20.740
<v Speaker 4>life and this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this tension and control that we have is</v>

2040
01:38:20.910 --> 01:38:25.770
<v Speaker 4>a lot of time just pointless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's highlighted by martial arts</v>

2041
01:38:25.771 --> 01:38:26.520
<v Speaker 4>training.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2042
01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:28.540
<v Speaker 4>I think it's almost always pointless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2043
01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:31.590
<v Speaker 4>Although you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing is you look at a good fighter,</v>

2044
01:38:31.650 --> 01:38:34.740
<v Speaker 4>just like if you look at a good dancer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's definitely a sense in which</v>

2045
01:38:34.741 --> 01:38:37.020
<v Speaker 4>they're just flowing and they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>responding,</v>

2046
01:38:37.350 --> 01:38:39.450
<v Speaker 4>but then when they need to be tensed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>

2047
01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:41.700
<v Speaker 4>they got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like they got that power behind</v>

2048
01:38:41.701 --> 01:38:43.290
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you were dancing,</v>

2049
01:38:43.291 --> 01:38:43.861
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any.</v>

2050
01:38:43.861 --> 01:38:46.290
<v Speaker 4>All you did was just flatty flow.</v>

2051
01:38:46.530 --> 01:38:49.050
<v Speaker 4>You would have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there'd be no form to it.</v>

2052
01:38:49.051 --> 01:38:51.300
<v Speaker 4>It's like you need the pulling in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need that.</v>

2053
01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:53.640
<v Speaker 4>So it's about the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's about the intelligent use of</v>

2054
01:38:53.641 --> 01:38:54.480
<v Speaker 4>tension,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2055
01:38:54.780 --> 01:38:58.830
<v Speaker 4>knowing when to be soft and then when to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be having those two sides.</v>

2056
01:38:59.610 --> 01:39:01.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what I'm talking about,</v>

2057
01:39:01.321 --> 01:39:05.130
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the management of stressful physically</v>

2058
01:39:05.131 --> 01:39:08.250
<v Speaker 4>difficult things on a regular basis</v>
<v Speaker 4>frees the mind.</v>

2059
01:39:08.540 --> 01:39:09.500
<v Speaker 4>Now just the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2060
01:39:09.550 --> 01:39:12.900
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the getting comfortable with conflict</v>

2061
01:39:13.290 --> 01:39:17.190
<v Speaker 4>and when in the absence of conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you look to try to restrict and</v>

2062
01:39:17.191 --> 01:39:20.490
<v Speaker 4>control everything and then every little</v>
<v Speaker 4>affront to that,</v>

2063
01:39:20.670 --> 01:39:25.170
<v Speaker 4>any little questioning and challenging</v>
<v Speaker 4>of your control over things can cause</v>

2064
01:39:25.171 --> 01:39:28.710
<v Speaker 4>anxiety because you're uncomfortable</v>
<v Speaker 4>with this idea of surrender,</v>

2065
01:39:28.711 --> 01:39:30.420
<v Speaker 4>of relax hoagland.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>

2066
01:39:30.630 --> 01:39:34.410
<v Speaker 4>Whether it's in psychedelics or whether</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's meditation or all these things.</v>

2067
01:39:34.411 --> 01:39:36.030
<v Speaker 4>There's some relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2068
01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:38.670
<v Speaker 4>and stand up comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>communicating,</v>

2069
01:39:38.671 --> 01:39:40.560
<v Speaker 4>podcast hosting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good Morning America.</v>

2070
01:39:40.561 --> 01:39:45.560
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's so many parallels because</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of it is in managing the mind and</v>

2071
01:39:45.570 --> 01:39:48.120
<v Speaker 4>just being able to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

2072
01:39:48.121 --> 01:39:50.520
<v Speaker 4>get out of your own way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

2073
01:39:50.810 --> 01:39:51.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2074
01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:52.700
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got that shit sorted out</v>

2075
01:39:54.340 --> 01:39:58.020
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll pop up again in your cost while</v>

2076
01:39:58.030 --> 01:39:59.080
<v Speaker 3>you got to keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2077
01:39:59.081 --> 01:39:59.914
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these uses,</v>

2078
01:39:59.950 --> 01:40:02.530
<v Speaker 3>these books are all saying the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing again and again and again,</v>

2079
01:40:02.531 --> 01:40:04.180
<v Speaker 3>but you still need to read it because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you forget.</v>

2080
01:40:04.460 --> 01:40:05.171
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2081
01:40:05.171 --> 01:40:06.940
<v Speaker 3>And it gets a little bit easier all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2082
01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:09.140
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>managing the mind gets a little easier</v>

2083
01:40:09.150 --> 01:40:11.330
<v Speaker 4>in part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could chalk up to maturity and life</v>

2084
01:40:11.331 --> 01:40:13.460
<v Speaker 4>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's also just this continual</v>

2085
01:40:13.461 --> 01:40:16.970
<v Speaker 4>practice of paying attention to what's</v>
<v Speaker 4>going on inside your head.</v>

2086
01:40:17.070 --> 01:40:19.920
<v Speaker 3>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeff doesn't like my analogy that I'm</v>

2087
01:40:19.921 --> 01:40:22.530
<v Speaker 3>about to use because he thinks it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>slightly aggressive and he's right,</v>

2088
01:40:22.531 --> 01:40:25.200
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's mostly meant for comic effect,</v>

2089
01:40:25.201 --> 01:40:28.290
<v Speaker 3>but it's like when you have a dog who</v>
<v Speaker 3>takes a shit on the rug,</v>

2090
01:40:28.291 --> 01:40:30.060
<v Speaker 3>you kinda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you've got to put their snout</v>

2091
01:40:30.061 --> 01:40:34.140
<v Speaker 3>and shit and that is what we're doing in</v>
<v Speaker 3>meditation and in all of these</v>

2092
01:40:34.141 --> 01:40:38.280
<v Speaker 3>practices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seeing over and over again how crazy we</v>

2093
01:40:38.281 --> 01:40:40.050
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the fear arises,</v>

2094
01:40:40.051 --> 01:40:43.170
<v Speaker 3>how the anger arises,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the discontent with whatever's</v>

2095
01:40:43.171 --> 01:40:47.490
<v Speaker 3>happening right now arises and not</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting owned by it.</v>

2096
01:40:47.650 --> 01:40:50.160
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's why these practices so useful</v>

2097
01:40:50.161 --> 01:40:52.500
<v Speaker 3>and why you got to stick with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't get just fixed,</v>

2098
01:40:52.670 --> 01:40:53.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't work.</v>

2099
01:40:53.591 --> 01:40:54.340
<v Speaker 3>That was nothing</v>

2100
01:40:54.340 --> 01:40:55.173
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2101
01:40:55.270 --> 01:40:56.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of people</v>

2102
01:40:56.590 --> 01:40:57.550
<v Speaker 3>blood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're selling them.</v>

2103
01:40:58.490 --> 01:41:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something real.</v>

2104
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:05.110
<v Speaker 1>What's the most annoying aspect of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you guys?</v>

2105
01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:08.270
<v Speaker 1>Please go to the power of positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

2106
01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:09.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2107
01:41:09.290 --> 01:41:10.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about that yesterday</v>

2108
01:41:10.881 --> 01:41:14.870
<v Speaker 1>where people were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>President Oprah and I reminded everyone</v>

2109
01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:17.150
<v Speaker 1>about Oprah and the secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2110
01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:20.030
<v Speaker 1>do you know how many fucking people ruin</v>
<v Speaker 1>their lives because they thought all</v>

2111
01:41:20.031 --> 01:41:23.390
<v Speaker 1>they had to do was have a vision board</v>
<v Speaker 1>and think positive and this is going to</v>

2112
01:41:23.391 --> 01:41:25.120
<v Speaker 1>be the key to happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2113
01:41:25.770 --> 01:41:29.100
<v Speaker 3>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the most pernicious ideas</v>

2114
01:41:29.101 --> 01:41:34.020
<v Speaker 3>that's ever been sort of released into</v>
<v Speaker 3>our culture and it even predates the</v>

2115
01:41:34.021 --> 01:41:36.270
<v Speaker 3>secret because there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a book called the power of</v>

2116
01:41:36.271 --> 01:41:38.100
<v Speaker 3>positive thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's another book called think and</v>

2117
01:41:38.101 --> 01:41:41.310
<v Speaker 3>grow rich.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want people to go buy these</v>

2118
01:41:41.311 --> 01:41:46.090
<v Speaker 3>books because I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See that the idea that you can solve all</v>

2119
01:41:46.110 --> 01:41:51.110
<v Speaker 3>your problems through the power of</v>
<v Speaker 3>positive thinking is so easily</v>

2120
01:41:51.300 --> 01:41:54.210
<v Speaker 3>disproved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just engaged in the following thought</v>

2121
01:41:54.211 --> 01:41:59.160
<v Speaker 3>experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anybody who's born right now in a</v>

2122
01:41:59.161 --> 01:42:02.520
<v Speaker 3>refugee camp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were they thinking incorrectly in Utero</v>

2123
01:42:02.910 --> 01:42:07.020
<v Speaker 3>in 2010 when the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When the earthquake hit Puerto Prince,</v>

2124
01:42:07.021 --> 01:42:09.180
<v Speaker 3>Haiti,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was everybody in town thinking</v>

2125
01:42:09.181 --> 01:42:11.100
<v Speaker 3>incorrectly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did they bring that upon themselves?</v>

2126
01:42:11.130 --> 01:42:12.900
<v Speaker 3>Of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course not,</v>

2127
01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:17.220
<v Speaker 3>and yet we're telling all these people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that if you make a good vision board,</v>

2128
01:42:17.221 --> 01:42:19.800
<v Speaker 3>you can carry your cancer or you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to go to the doctor.</v>

2129
01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:24.000
<v Speaker 3>All this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is demonstrably false and recklessly</v>

2130
01:42:24.030 --> 01:42:24.863
<v Speaker 3>dangerous</v>

2131
01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:28.920
<v Speaker 1>and most of the people that have had</v>
<v Speaker 1>success with the power of positive</v>

2132
01:42:28.921 --> 01:42:32.040
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they attributed to that,</v>

2133
01:42:32.041 --> 01:42:35.760
<v Speaker 1>but you're not talking to any of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that thought the exact same way</v>

2134
01:42:35.761 --> 01:42:37.860
<v Speaker 1>and failed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're only talking to the successful</v>

2135
01:42:37.861 --> 01:42:40.590
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The the sampling is so biased.</v>

2136
01:42:41.110 --> 01:42:43.360
<v Speaker 3>The only people who've had all their</v>
<v Speaker 3>problems solved through the power of</v>

2137
01:42:43.361 --> 01:42:47.650
<v Speaker 3>positive thinking or the people writing</v>
<v Speaker 3>those fucking books and selling all the</v>

2138
01:42:47.651 --> 01:42:49.840
<v Speaker 3>copies and if by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it was that easy,</v>

2139
01:42:49.841 --> 01:42:51.190
<v Speaker 3>they're all new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One book.</v>

2140
01:42:51.460 --> 01:42:51.971
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2141
01:42:51.971 --> 01:42:53.500
<v Speaker 1>I would say writing books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep saying,</v>

2142
01:42:53.501 --> 01:42:56.590
<v Speaker 1>come back to this next seminar in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>freezing cold room with your credit</v>

2143
01:42:56.591 --> 01:42:59.110
<v Speaker 1>card,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I will say the one part of it that</v>

2144
01:42:59.140 --> 01:43:02.680
<v Speaker 1>they idea that you can have an intention</v>
<v Speaker 1>that having a clear intention of</v>

2145
01:43:02.681 --> 01:43:05.680
<v Speaker 1>something about how you want to be or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you want to have happen,</v>

2146
01:43:05.860 --> 01:43:08.290
<v Speaker 1>that that can be helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's common sense,</v>

2147
01:43:08.630 --> 01:43:11.750
<v Speaker 1>the difference between having a positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>attitude.</v>

2148
01:43:11.970 --> 01:43:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely beneficial.</v>

2149
01:43:14.350 --> 01:43:15.340
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2150
01:43:15.341 --> 01:43:16.580
<v Speaker 1>Do you guys have you heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2151
01:43:16.830 --> 01:43:17.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>William James,</v>

2152
01:43:17.801 --> 01:43:20.830
<v Speaker 1>the great kind of psych psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mystic,</v>

2153
01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:23.530
<v Speaker 1>he was a mystic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had this really cool,</v>

2154
01:43:23.531 --> 01:43:24.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he talked about,</v>

2155
01:43:24.700 --> 01:43:27.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was called first born versus</v>

2156
01:43:27.101 --> 01:43:29.530
<v Speaker 1>twice born or one sport once born and</v>
<v Speaker 1>twice born.</v>

2157
01:43:29.860 --> 01:43:32.620
<v Speaker 1>And it was a fundamental way in which</v>
<v Speaker 1>you distinguished people who had,</v>

2158
01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:35.140
<v Speaker 1>who have maybe had a spiritual outlook</v>
<v Speaker 1>in life.</v>

2159
01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:38.290
<v Speaker 1>And he said the ones born people were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were just naturally,</v>

2160
01:43:38.460 --> 01:43:40.060
<v Speaker 1>they're the kind of the positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinkers.</v>

2161
01:43:40.061 --> 01:43:43.660
<v Speaker 1>The kind of like everything is perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is awesome.</v>

2162
01:43:43.661 --> 01:43:48.661
<v Speaker 1>This rose colored view of reality and</v>
<v Speaker 1>really not able to kind of see suffering</v>

2163
01:43:49.121 --> 01:43:50.650
<v Speaker 1>and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of a thing,</v>

2164
01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:53.660
<v Speaker 1>and we all Kinda know people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It kind of the classic,</v>

2165
01:43:53.890 --> 01:43:56.180
<v Speaker 1>a naive spiritual person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2166
01:43:56.660 --> 01:44:00.740
<v Speaker 1>but he was really interested in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he called twice born and that's</v>

2167
01:44:00.741 --> 01:44:02.030
<v Speaker 1>what he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like that's,</v>

2168
01:44:02.060 --> 01:44:05.600
<v Speaker 1>that's certainly how I identify which is</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody who can come into a kind of</v>

2169
01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:08.480
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a mystical or spiritual perspective</v>

2170
01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:13.780
<v Speaker 1>but has to but only did it via having to</v>
<v Speaker 1>look hard at the reality of suffering at</v>

2171
01:44:14.121 --> 01:44:16.950
<v Speaker 1>the reality of evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of fucked up shit in the world like</v>

2172
01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:19.790
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't wave away the world's unfair</v>

2173
01:44:19.791 --> 01:44:24.791
<v Speaker 1>distribution of wealth and hardship and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you had to come to that.</v>

2174
01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:30.040
<v Speaker 1>You had to come to your view through a</v>
<v Speaker 1>honest reckoning with the crappy stuff</v>

2175
01:44:30.891 --> 01:44:33.740
<v Speaker 1>about being a human being and the crappy</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that's out there and that you</v>

2176
01:44:33.741 --> 01:44:36.200
<v Speaker 1>couldn't not look at it and that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could do that.</v>

2177
01:44:36.260 --> 01:44:40.430
<v Speaker 1>Like tolstoy was the famous example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you kind of could be reborn into a,</v>

2178
01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:45.350
<v Speaker 1>a perspective that was wide enough to</v>
<v Speaker 1>include the full bittersweet and that.</v>

2179
01:44:45.351 --> 01:44:47.090
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that's what I think to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2180
01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:48.410
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the twice born,</v>

2181
01:44:48.411 --> 01:44:53.000
<v Speaker 1>the first born outlook is kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>repellent because it seems like it's not</v>

2182
01:44:53.001 --> 01:44:56.930
<v Speaker 1>looking at the truth of all the very</v>
<v Speaker 1>real challenges that are going out</v>

2183
01:44:56.931 --> 01:44:58.010
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you could just be in,</v>

2184
01:44:58.011 --> 01:44:59.600
<v Speaker 1>you'd go to your yoga class and heat</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

2185
01:44:59.870 --> 01:45:02.570
<v Speaker 1>your perfect raw food and be in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect bubble.</v>

2186
01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:04.930
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but meanwhile the world is just</v>

2187
01:45:04.970 --> 01:45:08.960
<v Speaker 1>contracted in pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to really be a kind of true,</v>

2188
01:45:08.990 --> 01:45:13.910
<v Speaker 1>expansive humanist is to kind of look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that and to still find your way into</v>

2189
01:45:13.911 --> 01:45:15.530
<v Speaker 1>thinking that life is worth living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2190
01:45:15.531 --> 01:45:17.720
<v Speaker 1>there's a mystery there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

2191
01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:18.553
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2192
01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:19.620
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying.</v>

2193
01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:23.220
<v Speaker 4>I guess you have to recognize that there</v>
<v Speaker 4>are these horrible things in the world,</v>

2194
01:45:23.221 --> 01:45:28.221
<v Speaker 4>but concentrating on them fully in an</v>
<v Speaker 4>only is not going to benefit you in</v>

2195
01:45:29.020 --> 01:45:30.330
<v Speaker 4>form.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's also true.</v>

2196
01:45:30.570 --> 01:45:35.570
<v Speaker 4>It's like there are amazing things to</v>
<v Speaker 4>this life and the more you concentrate</v>

2197
01:45:35.701 --> 01:45:38.730
<v Speaker 4>on them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more you'll recognize them,</v>

2198
01:45:38.731 --> 01:45:43.200
<v Speaker 4>the more you'll sort of baskin right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The amazing experience that we're all</v>

2199
01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:46.470
<v Speaker 4>going through this right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so what you're describing as</v>

2200
01:45:46.471 --> 01:45:49.530
<v Speaker 4>elements of positive thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the good side.</v>

2201
01:45:49.590 --> 01:45:52.470
<v Speaker 4>That's totally legit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That positivity,</v>

2202
01:45:53.220 --> 01:45:55.320
<v Speaker 4>positive attitude as opposed to positive</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking,</v>

2203
01:45:55.321 --> 01:45:58.830
<v Speaker 4>which is loaded up with this idea of</v>
<v Speaker 4>like sort of mental control of the</v>

2204
01:45:58.860 --> 01:46:01.700
<v Speaker 4>external world and that I think is</v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous,</v>

2205
01:46:01.701 --> 01:46:03.780
<v Speaker 4>but I think Joe's describing is</v>
<v Speaker 4>gratitude.</v>

2206
01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:05.450
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

2207
01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:06.341
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

2208
01:46:06.341 --> 01:46:08.580
<v Speaker 4>that's so important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's important to parse this out.</v>

2209
01:46:08.610 --> 01:46:11.850
<v Speaker 4>What part of this is healthy and good</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what part of this is destructive?</v>

2210
01:46:12.010 --> 01:46:13.060
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

2211
01:46:13.110 --> 01:46:15.300
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what part of it you could parse out</v>

2212
01:46:15.330 --> 01:46:18.060
<v Speaker 4>from what you would call the law of</v>
<v Speaker 4>attraction,</v>

2213
01:46:18.150 --> 01:46:20.120
<v Speaker 4>which is not a law,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I was not.</v>

2214
01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:22.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's another part of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>problem too.</v>

2215
01:46:22.021 --> 01:46:25.950
<v Speaker 4>Like the Wu is written in the title like</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not a law,</v>

2216
01:46:26.190 --> 01:46:29.940
<v Speaker 4>it's just that's not what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you calling it the law of attraction,</v>

2217
01:46:29.941 --> 01:46:32.580
<v Speaker 4>let's be know you're full of shit that</v>
<v Speaker 4>was law made by Zeus.</v>

2218
01:46:33.910 --> 01:46:38.370
<v Speaker 4>See that episode of Hercules.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something that's undeniably</v>

2219
01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:43.400
<v Speaker 4>important about positive thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having a positive attitude and being</v>

2220
01:46:44.341 --> 01:46:49.341
<v Speaker 4>enthusiastic and having energy and</v>
<v Speaker 4>focusing on the good and focusing your</v>

2221
01:46:49.351 --> 01:46:51.750
<v Speaker 4>goals and focus on what you're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>achieve,</v>

2222
01:46:52.050 --> 01:46:55.220
<v Speaker 4>but the idea that that in and of itself</v>
<v Speaker 4>is all you need,</v>

2223
01:46:55.221 --> 01:46:58.080
<v Speaker 4>that that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's uniquely powerful and then it can</v>

2224
01:46:58.081 --> 01:47:02.680
<v Speaker 4>literally bring you your future and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these people that say that,</v>

2225
01:47:02.681 --> 01:47:04.550
<v Speaker 4>that this is what they used,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you know,</v>

2226
01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:09.560
<v Speaker 4>you might have been successful and that</v>
<v Speaker 4>might be your underlying thought</v>

2227
01:47:09.931 --> 01:47:14.520
<v Speaker 4>process,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there is a wider series of factors.</v>

2228
01:47:14.530 --> 01:47:18.210
<v Speaker 4>There's a big spectrum of things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>had to happen for you to be successful,</v>

2229
01:47:18.211 --> 01:47:21.630
<v Speaker 4>including luck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including the great fortune of being</v>

2230
01:47:21.631 --> 01:47:23.700
<v Speaker 4>born in America and privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2231
01:47:24.170 --> 01:47:27.480
<v Speaker 4>there's so many different places.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could be so many different life</v>

2232
01:47:27.481 --> 01:47:30.450
<v Speaker 4>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've could have had horrific parental</v>

2233
01:47:30.451 --> 01:47:33.420
<v Speaker 4>situations in an household,</v>
<v Speaker 4>situations you could have been born</v>

2234
01:47:33.421 --> 01:47:35.550
<v Speaker 4>into.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're extremely lucky.</v>

2235
01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:39.750
<v Speaker 3>Look at the case of James Arthur Ray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I covered it extensively for ABC news</v>

2236
01:47:39.751 --> 01:47:42.360
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was one of the gurus in the secret,</v>

2237
01:47:42.870 --> 01:47:47.190
<v Speaker 3>in the DVD of the secret.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was one of the guys talking about how</v>

2238
01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:51.780
<v Speaker 3>the universe is like Aladdin's lamp and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he held a sweat lodge ceremony in</v>

2239
01:47:51.781 --> 01:47:52.710
<v Speaker 3>Sedona,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arizona,</v>

2240
01:47:52.711 --> 01:47:54.300
<v Speaker 3>which several people died and he went to</v>
<v Speaker 3>prison.</v>

2241
01:47:55.060 --> 01:47:56.910
<v Speaker 3>So how well was the law of attraction</v>
<v Speaker 3>work for him?</v>

2242
01:47:57.740 --> 01:47:58.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe it did work.</v>

2243
01:48:00.530 --> 01:48:02.440
<v Speaker 4>He put in a bunch of bullshit and got</v>
<v Speaker 4>some.</v>

2244
01:48:02.740 --> 01:48:04.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They also found in his hotel room a lot</v>

2245
01:48:04.791 --> 01:48:08.300
<v Speaker 3>of like a hgh and testosterone and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

2246
01:48:08.301 --> 01:48:11.990
<v Speaker 3>So he definitely wasn't as buff just</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the power of positive things</v>

2247
01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:17.220
<v Speaker 4>and he was trying to do what would the</v>
<v Speaker 4>sweat lodge like,</v>

2248
01:48:17.221 --> 01:48:18.100
<v Speaker 4>what was the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>

2249
01:48:18.810 --> 01:48:20.760
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sweat lodge is a beautiful ceremony</v>

2250
01:48:20.761 --> 01:48:22.150
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for native Americans,</v>

2251
01:48:22.740 --> 01:48:26.850
<v Speaker 3>people too hot or too hot and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>overheated and their electrolyte balance</v>

2252
01:48:26.851 --> 01:48:30.630
<v Speaker 3>got crazy or something and how to people</v>
<v Speaker 3>dying or something like that.</v>

2253
01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:32.970
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was awhile ago so I can't remember,</v>

2254
01:48:32.971 --> 01:48:34.170
<v Speaker 3>but I think it was two people.</v>

2255
01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:39.560
<v Speaker 4>The problem with a lot of those people</v>
<v Speaker 4>too is that what they do is they,</v>

2256
01:48:39.750 --> 01:48:43.740
<v Speaker 4>they put together like some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>program where maybe it's a book,</v>

2257
01:48:43.770 --> 01:48:46.420
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's a a guideline you're supposed</v>
<v Speaker 4>to follow.</v>

2258
01:48:46.421 --> 01:48:49.830
<v Speaker 4>Then they start teaching seminars in it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they start putting it into practice</v>

2259
01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:53.520
<v Speaker 4>and leading all these people with this</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff and that it becomes who they are,</v>

2260
01:48:53.750 --> 01:48:58.410
<v Speaker 4>like who they are is like a guru who</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are as a spiritual person and</v>

2261
01:48:58.411 --> 01:49:01.860
<v Speaker 4>people come to them that the dynamic</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have people come to them,</v>

2262
01:49:02.010 --> 01:49:06.090
<v Speaker 4>what should I do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the universe provides bounty.</v>

2263
01:49:06.150 --> 01:49:08.310
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and everybody claps and goes along with</v>

2264
01:49:08.311 --> 01:49:11.190
<v Speaker 4>it and they live in this sort of bubble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2265
01:49:11.191 --> 01:49:13.970
<v Speaker 4>And it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it gets really odd with those folks.</v>

2266
01:49:14.070 --> 01:49:15.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was why.</v>

2267
01:49:15.451 --> 01:49:19.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had been assigned a years and years</v>

2268
01:49:19.140 --> 01:49:23.070
<v Speaker 3>ago to cover faith and spirituality for</v>
<v Speaker 3>ABC news even though I'm an agnostic and</v>

2269
01:49:23.310 --> 01:49:27.090
<v Speaker 3>I ended up covering a lot of these new</v>
<v Speaker 3>age gurus and that was why I ended up.</v>

2270
01:49:27.091 --> 01:49:30.060
<v Speaker 3>My first book I wrote was called 10</v>
<v Speaker 3>percent happier because I was trying to</v>

2271

<v Speaker 3>this was doing to people's lives.</v>

2274
01:49:40.100 --> 01:49:42.830
<v Speaker 4>It's so far.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've been talking about that a lot</v>

2275
01:49:42.831 --> 01:49:45.440
<v Speaker 4>lately.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so many people that are trying</v>

2276
01:49:45.441 --> 01:49:49.600
<v Speaker 4>to get in this on sort of the open level</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you see it on Instagram,</v>

2277
01:49:49.601 --> 01:49:53.350
<v Speaker 4>like there's a lot of people like</v>
<v Speaker 4>promoting these inspirational little</v>

2278
01:49:53.351 --> 01:49:58.070
<v Speaker 4>posts and they'll have these little</v>
<v Speaker 4>inspirational videos like you know,</v>

2279
01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:03.080
<v Speaker 4>what you got to do today is go out there</v>
<v Speaker 4>and embrace life and just go after your</v>

2280
01:50:03.701 --> 01:50:06.400
<v Speaker 4>goals and like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's so many people that are</v>

01:50:06.401 --> 01:50:11.401
<v Speaker 4>trying to give people this fuel and give</v>
<v Speaker 4>people this and they might not</v>

2282
01:50:12.731 --> 01:50:17.080
<v Speaker 4>necessarily really even be in practice</v>
<v Speaker 4>with that themselves.</v>

2283
01:50:17.490 --> 01:50:18.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's A.</v>

2284
01:50:18.930 --> 01:50:21.540
<v Speaker 1>I liked the open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like your analogy about the open mic.</v>

2285
01:50:21.790 --> 01:50:23.890
<v Speaker 4>That is what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like they're trying it out.</v>

2286
01:50:23.891 --> 01:50:25.960
<v Speaker 4>They're learning how to be an Anthony</v>
<v Speaker 4>Robbins.</v>

2287
01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Tony Robbins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny.</v>

2288
01:50:27.391 --> 01:50:30.880
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who was living in France</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they came back to Canada and he'd</v>

2289
01:50:30.900 --> 01:50:33.780
<v Speaker 1>been in Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>live in there for like 10 years or</v>

2290
01:50:33.781 --> 01:50:37.890
<v Speaker 1>something and so he's walking around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>streets of Toronto and he said it was</v>

2291
01:50:37.891 --> 01:50:41.310
<v Speaker 1>the same when he was anywhere in North</v>
<v Speaker 1>America and he kept feeling like there</v>

2292
01:50:41.311 --> 01:50:43.220
<v Speaker 1>was something wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he couldn't put his finger on it.</v>

2293
01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:44.250
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is wrong?</v>

2294
01:50:44.251 --> 01:50:46.500
<v Speaker 1>Something wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he realized that everyone was</v>

2295
01:50:46.501 --> 01:50:49.920
<v Speaker 1>actually having the same conversation</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time over and over again,</v>

2296
01:50:49.921 --> 01:50:51.120
<v Speaker 1>which was everything's gonna be all</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2297
01:50:51.380 --> 01:50:53.280
<v Speaker 1>Adam is going to be all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's going to be all right.</v>

2298
01:50:53.281 --> 01:50:56.340
<v Speaker 1>It was just this constant pepe</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheerleading from everywhere.</v>

2299
01:50:56.341 --> 01:51:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Whereas in France it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are fucked that is fucked.</v>

2300
01:51:00.510 --> 01:51:01.580
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are shit.</v>

2301
01:51:01.690 --> 01:51:03.910
<v Speaker 1>And that's what it's like being in</v>
<v Speaker 1>France know.</v>

2302
01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:06.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like at least they're honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that has its downsides,</v>

2303
01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:08.940
<v Speaker 1>downside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean there's also a realism where</v>

2304
01:51:08.941 --> 01:51:10.860
<v Speaker 1>people are just gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like call it out as it is.</v>

2305
01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:12.120
<v Speaker 1>We're here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's such A.</v>

2306
01:51:12.121 --> 01:51:16.210
<v Speaker 1>There's a tendency to just to Kinda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There can be this kind of Pollyanna ish.</v>

2307
01:51:16.260 --> 01:51:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Everything is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is fine because people don't</v>

2308
01:51:18.271 --> 01:51:20.520
<v Speaker 1>really want to look at what's under,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's lurking underneath,</v>

2309
01:51:20.521 --> 01:51:21.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2310
01:51:21.361 --> 01:51:24.570
<v Speaker 1>everything's fine right now in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

2311
01:51:24.660 --> 01:51:26.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time.</v>

2312
01:51:26.101 --> 01:51:31.101
<v Speaker 1>Now we've got pro most of the time in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but can we talk about the mystical</v>

2313
01:51:31.441 --> 01:51:36.330
<v Speaker 1>mystery underbelly weirdness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>show off this idea that everything is</v>

2314
01:51:36.331 --> 01:51:39.510
<v Speaker 1>fine in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this exact moment right now,</v>

2315
01:51:40.050 --> 01:51:43.320
<v Speaker 1>like so in practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something Shin Zen taught me</v>

2316
01:51:43.710 --> 01:51:47.640
<v Speaker 1>that the more you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like the present moment is</v>

2317
01:51:47.641 --> 01:51:49.830
<v Speaker 1>on a continuum and that didn't sound</v>
<v Speaker 1>make any sense,</v>

2318
01:51:49.831 --> 01:51:53.940
<v Speaker 1>but it's like you can be present and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to be more present and more and</v>

2319
01:51:53.941 --> 01:51:56.460
<v Speaker 1>more and you can start to get a feeling</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>

2320
01:51:56.700 --> 01:52:00.900
<v Speaker 1>For practice of just the absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's like you're getting closer and</v>

2321
01:52:00.901 --> 01:52:03.480
<v Speaker 1>closer to the absolute now with ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually getting there,</v>

2322
01:52:03.540 --> 01:52:05.670
<v Speaker 1>which I know just sounds like a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>gobbly goop,</v>

2323
01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:07.650
<v Speaker 1>but the feeling on the inside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just this.</v>

2324
01:52:08.430 --> 01:52:10.380
<v Speaker 1>Everything is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the silence,</v>

2325
01:52:10.381 --> 01:52:12.810
<v Speaker 1>this presence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this sacredness,</v>

2326
01:52:12.840 --> 01:52:15.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the no bullshit kind of sacredness</v>

2327
01:52:17.610 --> 01:52:18.750
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that,</v>

2328
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:21.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to me is like I wrote about</v>

2329
01:52:21.330 --> 01:52:24.420
<v Speaker 1>consciousness for a long time before I</v>
<v Speaker 1>started realizing that there's this</v>

2330
01:52:24.421 --> 01:52:27.510
<v Speaker 1>thing here and how do you talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you write about it in a way it</v>

2331
01:52:27.511 --> 01:52:29.190
<v Speaker 1>doesn't sound ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2332
01:52:29.430 --> 01:52:32.760
<v Speaker 1>and yet it is the most important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is the most,</v>

2333
01:52:33.010 --> 01:52:36.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it orients you to be able to come into</v>

2334
01:52:36.361 --> 01:52:37.630
<v Speaker 1>that understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2335
01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:38.850
<v Speaker 1>How do we talk about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2336
01:52:38.851 --> 01:52:41.190
<v Speaker 1>the mystics have always said you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about it.</v>

2337
01:52:41.190 --> 01:52:43.740
<v Speaker 1>It's inevitable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's true as an experience.</v>

2338
01:52:44.100 --> 01:52:46.430
<v Speaker 1>But where is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bears talked about intelligently,</v>

2339
01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:49.430
<v Speaker 1>where are you going to read about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the New Yorker magazine or,</v>

2340
01:52:49.760 --> 01:52:51.080
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2341
01:52:51.081 --> 01:52:52.700
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's either talked about in this</v>

2342
01:52:52.701 --> 01:52:55.520
<v Speaker 1>Disneyland way or it's not talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

2343
01:52:55.550 --> 01:52:57.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like we got to try to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to try to,</v>

2344
01:52:57.921 --> 01:53:01.280
<v Speaker 1>or at least remember not taco about come</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find practices,</v>

2345
01:53:01.281 --> 01:53:04.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but honor that it's real and you know</v>

2346
01:53:04.791 --> 01:53:08.330
<v Speaker 1>that that's something I'm really</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in and I'm trying to learn</v>

2347
01:53:08.331 --> 01:53:09.200
<v Speaker 1>how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

2348
01:53:09.201 --> 01:53:10.920
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As an outsider,</v>

2349
01:53:10.940 --> 01:53:14.660
<v Speaker 1>if someone is coming to this with zero</v>
<v Speaker 1>meditation experience,</v>

2350
01:53:14.661 --> 01:53:17.360
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no thought whatsoever about pursuing</v>

2351
01:53:17.361 --> 01:53:19.550
<v Speaker 1>this and they're listening to you say</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things like,</v>

2352
01:53:19.551 --> 01:53:21.410
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's in it for me?</v>

2353
01:53:21.710 --> 01:53:23.450
<v Speaker 1>What do I get out of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do I get?</v>

2354
01:53:23.450 --> 01:53:25.250
<v Speaker 1>If I can get to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I get?</v>

2355
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:27.860
<v Speaker 1>What's what's in there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like you're just alive.</v>

2356
01:53:27.980 --> 01:53:30.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this doesn't seem like anything</v>

2357
01:53:30.411 --> 01:53:31.490
<v Speaker 1>changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2358
01:53:31.491 --> 01:53:33.380
<v Speaker 1>I think that is what you get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get your life,</v>

2359
01:53:33.410 --> 01:53:35.660
<v Speaker 1>you get your life back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time you're not in your</v>

2360
01:53:35.661 --> 01:53:37.310
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're freaking out about your life.</v>

2361
01:53:37.340 --> 01:53:39.380
<v Speaker 1>You're in your head thinking about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this or that happened,</v>

2362
01:53:39.390 --> 01:53:43.610
<v Speaker 1>or you're responding to situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you get is the capacity to be</v>

2363
01:53:43.611 --> 01:53:47.090
<v Speaker 1>sitting here in the middle of all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be an appreciate the richness and</v>

2364
01:53:47.091 --> 01:53:48.770
<v Speaker 1>the fullness of it because that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2365
01:53:48.771 --> 01:53:51.230
<v Speaker 1>It has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has a quality of a,</v>

2366
01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:54.410
<v Speaker 1>of fulfillment in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a quality of like nothing needs to</v>

2367
01:53:54.411 --> 01:53:58.130
<v Speaker 1>be any different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a peacefulness and a beauty</v>

2368
01:53:58.131 --> 01:53:59.930
<v Speaker 1>or something or even when things are</v>
<v Speaker 1>objective,</v>

2369
01:53:59.931 --> 01:54:03.290
<v Speaker 1>even when things are shitty and his</v>
<v Speaker 1>bittersweetness so you know,</v>

2370
01:54:03.291 --> 01:54:06.770
<v Speaker 1>this poignancy to things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you get exactly your life,</v>

2371
01:54:06.771 --> 01:54:07.604
<v Speaker 1>just more of it.</v>

2372
01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:08.630
<v Speaker 1>And that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2373
01:54:08.690 --> 01:54:11.300
<v Speaker 1>Shinzen used to say it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you lived,</v>

2374
01:54:11.330 --> 01:54:14.450
<v Speaker 1>it's like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to live 10 times deeper or va</v>

2375
01:54:14.451 --> 01:54:17.420
<v Speaker 1>one time to two times deeper or three</v>
<v Speaker 1>times or four times the more you</v>

2376
01:54:17.421 --> 01:54:18.254
<v Speaker 1>practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2377
01:54:18.410 --> 01:54:22.010
<v Speaker 1>it's the same surface,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the depth dimension that's</v>

2378
01:54:22.011 --> 01:54:25.340
<v Speaker 1>getting like richer and fuller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>broader.</v>

2379
01:54:25.730 --> 01:54:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2380
01:54:26.670 --> 01:54:29.930
<v Speaker 1>and so then it gives you the capacity to</v>
<v Speaker 1>also to appreciate more and more what's</v>

2381
01:54:29.931 --> 01:54:32.180
<v Speaker 1>going on because most of the time we</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk around like,</v>

2382
01:54:32.181 --> 01:54:33.500
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the stuff I like looking at.</v>

2383
01:54:33.740 --> 01:54:36.400
<v Speaker 1>But I don't like this stuff over here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to feel these things are,</v>

2384
01:54:36.401 --> 01:54:37.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to see these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're like,</v>

2385
01:54:38.210 --> 01:54:39.470
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2386
01:54:39.890 --> 01:54:41.180
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like we live.</v>

2387
01:54:41.210 --> 01:54:43.700
<v Speaker 1>The analogy I use is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're born into a mansion,</v>

2388
01:54:43.970 --> 01:54:45.290
<v Speaker 1>but room by room we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>

2389
01:54:45.291 --> 01:54:46.070
<v Speaker 1>can't go in there.</v>

2390
01:54:46.070 --> 01:54:48.020
<v Speaker 1>Can't go in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my ex girlfriend.</v>

2391
01:54:48.021 --> 01:54:49.490
<v Speaker 1>Or that's my relationship with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents.</v>

2392
01:54:49.491 --> 01:54:51.080
<v Speaker 1>Or Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's this limitation of this</v>

2393
01:54:51.081 --> 01:54:52.910
<v Speaker 1>limitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At some point we're just sitting there</v>

2394
01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:55.370
<v Speaker 1>under the stairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is fine.</v>

2395
01:54:55.630 --> 01:54:56.451
<v Speaker 1>I think it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2396
01:54:56.451 --> 01:54:58.700
<v Speaker 1>I've really enjoyed my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were hiding in the dark under the</v>

2397
01:54:58.701 --> 01:54:59.534
<v Speaker 1>stairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go.</v>

2398
01:54:59.930 --> 01:55:01.940
<v Speaker 1>So you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about reclaiming the mansion,</v>

2399
01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:02.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2400
01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:04.550
<v Speaker 1>can you be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said exactly,</v>

2401
01:55:04.551 --> 01:55:07.850
<v Speaker 1>can you be free in more and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>situations and can you begin to</v>

2402
01:55:07.851 --> 01:55:09.860
<v Speaker 1>appreciate the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2403
01:55:09.861 --> 01:55:13.760
<v Speaker 1>the beauty of even these difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>situations and that way your whole life</v>

2404
01:55:13.761 --> 01:55:16.310
<v Speaker 1>just kinda can open up to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the practice is about.</v>

2405
01:55:16.570 --> 01:55:20.320
<v Speaker 3>Other way of thinking about it and is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is a bit of a new age trope,</v>

2406
01:55:20.321 --> 01:55:22.780
<v Speaker 3>so it's a little annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's like what I said before that</v>

2407
01:55:23.290 --> 01:55:28.290
<v Speaker 3>cliches become cliches for a reason and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason is their true generally all</v>

2408
01:55:28.390 --> 01:55:33.390
<v Speaker 3>you get ever because right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything you've experienced in your</v>

2409
01:55:33.461 --> 01:55:37.750
<v Speaker 3>whole life happened to you right now and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything you ever will experience will</v>

2410
01:55:37.751 --> 01:55:40.150
<v Speaker 3>always happen to you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Non Negotiable.</v>

2411
01:55:40.570 --> 01:55:42.130
<v Speaker 3>We live most of our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

2412
01:55:42.131 --> 01:55:46.590
<v Speaker 3>in a autopilot of in a fog of rumination</v>
<v Speaker 3>and projection,</v>

2413
01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:49.140
<v Speaker 3>and we're not paying any attention to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only thing we ever get.</v>

2414
01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:53.280
<v Speaker 3>Meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>digging more deeply into the present</v>

2415
01:55:53.281 --> 01:55:56.160
<v Speaker 3>moment is giving you your life back</v>

2416
01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:59.200
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you address?</v>

2417
01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:04.320
<v Speaker 4>Because what we're talking about is</v>
<v Speaker 4>managing the mind and increasing</v>

2418
01:56:04.901 --> 01:56:07.360
<v Speaker 4>happiness by 10 percent or more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hopefully.</v>

2419
01:56:07.780 --> 01:56:11.890
<v Speaker 4>How do you address psych meds?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because a lot of people that are going</v>

2420
01:56:11.891 --> 01:56:16.030
<v Speaker 4>down this road have already gone down</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pharmaceutical road and might be</v>

2421
01:56:16.090 --> 01:56:21.090
<v Speaker 4>inextricably connected to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some sort of a way they might be on anti</v>

2422
01:56:21.270 --> 01:56:24.010
<v Speaker 4>anxiety medication,</v>
<v Speaker 4>be on antidepressants.</v>

2423
01:56:24.011 --> 01:56:25.540
<v Speaker 4>Like how do you address that?</v>

2424
01:56:26.230 --> 01:56:28.180
<v Speaker 3>Jay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I can speak for both of us and</v>

2425
01:56:28.181 --> 01:56:31.600
<v Speaker 3>that we are maximalists that when it</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes to wellbeing,</v>

2426
01:56:31.870 --> 01:56:33.340
<v Speaker 3>it's important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to surround the ball,</v>

2427
01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:35.230
<v Speaker 3>you got to use every Arrow in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>quiver,</v>

2428
01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:39.280
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just because we're in the meditation</v>

2429
01:56:39.281 --> 01:56:44.281
<v Speaker 3>doesn't mean we're not into all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other scientifically proven ways of</v>

2430
01:56:46.061 --> 01:56:48.220
<v Speaker 3>dealing with your mental health.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2431
01:56:48.670 --> 01:56:50.890
<v Speaker 3>I often say that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a culture,</v>

2432
01:56:50.891 --> 01:56:53.380
<v Speaker 3>we spent so much time working on our</v>
<v Speaker 3>bodies,</v>

2433
01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:58.440
<v Speaker 3>on our stock portfolio is on our cars</v>
<v Speaker 3>and no time on the one filter through</v>

2434
01:56:58.511 --> 01:57:00.850
<v Speaker 3>which we experience everything and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's our minds.</v>

2435
01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:05.080
<v Speaker 3>And so if you have clinically diagnosed</v>
<v Speaker 3>anxiety or depression,</v>

2436
01:57:05.110 --> 01:57:07.930
<v Speaker 3>which again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need to be talking about more openly</v>

2437
01:57:07.931 --> 01:57:09.310
<v Speaker 3>because there's so much stigma around</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2438
01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:12.340
<v Speaker 3>I've dealt with both since I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have that,</v>

2439
01:57:12.490 --> 01:57:15.940
<v Speaker 3>you should avail yourself of every</v>
<v Speaker 3>possible remedy and if your doctor</v>

2440
01:57:16.180 --> 01:57:20.320
<v Speaker 3>recommends a that you take psych meds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you should investigate it.</v>

2441
01:57:20.321 --> 01:57:22.600
<v Speaker 3>If it works for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then stay on a meditation is just</v>

2442
01:57:22.601 --> 01:57:26.680
<v Speaker 3>another thing you can also use along</v>
<v Speaker 3>with exercise,</v>

2443
01:57:26.681 --> 01:57:28.900
<v Speaker 3>getting enough sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having positive relationships,</v>

2444
01:57:28.901 --> 01:57:32.350
<v Speaker 3>having a healthy diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the other no brainers with Jeff and</v>

2445
01:57:32.351 --> 01:57:35.440
<v Speaker 3>I are saying is in the Pantheon of no</v>
<v Speaker 3>brainers,</v>

2446
01:57:35.590 --> 01:57:37.360
<v Speaker 3>meditation needs to be included.</v>

2447
01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:38.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2448
01:57:38.960 --> 01:57:41.210
<v Speaker 1>I think with the meds thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2449
01:57:42.010 --> 01:57:44.610
<v Speaker 1>sometimes meds can get you to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>baseline of uh,</v>

2450
01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:46.710
<v Speaker 1>then then you can meditate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2451
01:57:46.711 --> 01:57:49.590
<v Speaker 1>and it's almost like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2452
01:57:49.591 --> 01:57:52.470
<v Speaker 1>I know too many people whose lives have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been including people I know really,</v>

2453
01:57:52.471 --> 01:57:55.080
<v Speaker 1>really well really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really helped by these meds.</v>

2454
01:57:55.081 --> 01:57:57.090
<v Speaker 1>I know other people have had super hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>time with it,</v>

2455
01:57:57.450 --> 01:57:59.970
<v Speaker 1>but some of them at the same boat and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them it's like,</v>

2456
01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:04.380
<v Speaker 1>it gets you to a place where it's almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the meds can help by time for your</v>

2457
01:58:04.381 --> 01:58:08.220
<v Speaker 1>own system to work itself out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you get to a place where you're</v>

2458
01:58:08.250 --> 01:58:10.440
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of trouble with crazy</v>

2459
01:58:10.441 --> 01:58:12.330
<v Speaker 1>energy surges up and down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2460
01:58:12.630 --> 01:58:14.310
<v Speaker 1>and like a manic phase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2461
01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Like I get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get hypomanic and then I get like</v>

2462
01:58:16.621 --> 01:58:18.330
<v Speaker 1>disparate and then hyper hypo manic.</v>

2463
01:58:18.690 --> 01:58:20.670
<v Speaker 1>I actually just got a diagnosis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2464
01:58:20.730 --> 01:58:25.140
<v Speaker 1>two weeks ago that I probably have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mild form of bipolar is 46 years old.</v>

2465
01:58:25.141 --> 01:58:26.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm finally learning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a surprise.</v>

2466
01:58:26.611 --> 01:58:28.710
<v Speaker 1>I kind of knew how do they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do they diagnose that?</v>

2467
01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:30.280
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2468
01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:31.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was an interview,</v>

2469
01:58:31.500 --> 01:58:34.080
<v Speaker 1>so it's an hour long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This case was like an hour and a half or</v>

2470
01:58:34.081 --> 01:58:37.890
<v Speaker 1>an hour long interview or a guy just</v>
<v Speaker 1>really took my history,</v>

2471
01:58:37.891 --> 01:58:41.440
<v Speaker 1>like how I've been challenged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have add big time add that's,</v>

2472
01:58:41.630 --> 01:58:45.310
<v Speaker 1>that's been diagnosed multiple times but</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because the way my attention works,</v>

2473
01:58:45.640 --> 01:58:50.590
<v Speaker 1>but he basically really asked me lots of</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions about how about my history and</v>

2474
01:58:50.591 --> 01:58:55.230
<v Speaker 1>when things started to get into the more</v>
<v Speaker 1>surges and,</v>

2475
01:58:55.320 --> 01:58:57.570
<v Speaker 1>and they've been getting worse the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is entering [inaudible].</v>

2476
01:58:57.571 --> 01:58:59.970
<v Speaker 1>I meditated a ton but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2477
01:59:00.090 --> 01:59:01.690
<v Speaker 1>and there was a period of the meditation</v>
<v Speaker 1>was super,</v>

2478
01:59:01.691 --> 01:59:03.910
<v Speaker 1>super working really well and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stabilizing everything.</v>

2479
01:59:04.120 --> 01:59:06.310
<v Speaker 1>And then there was a period where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>meditation felt like it wasn't working</v>

2480
01:59:06.311 --> 01:59:08.950
<v Speaker 1>as well and all this energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like that trauma stuff I was</v>

2481
01:59:08.951 --> 01:59:10.810
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that stuff started to come up.</v>

2482
01:59:10.990 --> 01:59:14.530
<v Speaker 1>So I go more into these ups and downs</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I found that the practice would</v>

2483
01:59:14.531 --> 01:59:16.180
<v Speaker 1>help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would help me from feeding the</v>

2484
01:59:16.181 --> 01:59:19.110
<v Speaker 1>spikes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't I a,</v>

2485
01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:20.770
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't been totally addressing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

2486
01:59:20.771 --> 01:59:23.900
<v Speaker 1>I haven't actually started any meds or</v>
<v Speaker 1>done any lithium metal.</v>

2487
01:59:23.901 --> 01:59:27.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking maybe I would try that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I want to understand what folks</v>

2488
01:59:27.401 --> 01:59:28.960
<v Speaker 1>go through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2489
01:59:29.110 --> 01:59:31.690
<v Speaker 1>but basically he just asks a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

2490
01:59:32.230 --> 01:59:32.980
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2491
01:59:32.980 --> 01:59:35.230
<v Speaker 1>I guess he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a diagnostic criteria around a</v>

2492
01:59:35.231 --> 01:59:37.420
<v Speaker 1>set of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that seem to make sense for what we</v>

2493
01:59:37.421 --> 01:59:40.180
<v Speaker 1>know about it and because they've seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these patients,</v>

2494
01:59:40.181 --> 01:59:42.550
<v Speaker 1>they've got all these ideas and it's so</v>
<v Speaker 1>new.</v>

2495
01:59:42.550 --> 01:59:44.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what to do with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

2496
01:59:44.021 --> 01:59:45.520
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of can't believe I'm talking</v>

2497
01:59:45.530 --> 01:59:47.920
<v Speaker 1>about it because it seems a bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>premature,</v>

2498
01:59:48.370 --> 01:59:49.430
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2499
01:59:49.480 --> 01:59:52.690
<v Speaker 1>the way I think about it as I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>consider doing meds because I just want</v>

2500
01:59:52.691 --> 01:59:57.370
<v Speaker 1>to be able to get to a place where I</v>
<v Speaker 1>could then let my body heal itself,</v>

2501
01:59:57.371 --> 01:59:59.050
<v Speaker 1>help itself out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure itself out,</v>

2502
01:59:59.320 --> 02:00:01.060
<v Speaker 1>and the meds might buy me time to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2503
02:00:01.061 --> 02:00:04.600
<v Speaker 1>Then they and the meditation can be part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that as well and that's just a messy</v>

2504
02:00:04.601 --> 02:00:05.940
<v Speaker 1>human reality of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you,</v>

2505
02:00:05.941 --> 02:00:07.810
<v Speaker 1>you seem like you've got your shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

2506
02:00:07.811 --> 02:00:11.290
<v Speaker 1>So like what is it exactly that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>bothering you so much?</v>

2507
02:00:11.380 --> 02:00:13.120
<v Speaker 1>You'd actually be considering</v>
<v Speaker 1>medication?</v>

2508
02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's try writing a book with them.</v>

2509
02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:16.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2510
02:00:17.380 --> 02:00:21.340
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six days a week and then one day a week.</v>

2511
02:00:21.610 --> 02:00:23.350
<v Speaker 1>So there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the potential stuff.</v>

2512
02:00:23.351 --> 02:00:26.800
<v Speaker 1>Just being overexcited about things in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my getting pulled in every direction.</v>

2513
02:00:26.801 --> 02:00:28.690
<v Speaker 1>That's not really a problem so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

2514
02:00:28.691 --> 02:00:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Like I've learned to the problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were more like you disappoint</v>

2515
02:00:31.811 --> 02:00:33.370
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel like you can't get your shit</v>

2516
02:00:33.371 --> 02:00:34.810
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2517
02:00:34.811 --> 02:00:38.770
<v Speaker 1>you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just so scattered that can happen</v>

2518
02:00:38.771 --> 02:00:40.600
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that back and upgrade its own</v>

2519
02:00:40.601 --> 02:00:42.520
<v Speaker 1>challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the energy ones are more</v>

2520
02:00:42.521 --> 02:00:43.630
<v Speaker 1>fundamental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2521
02:00:43.870 --> 02:00:45.400
<v Speaker 1>I'll wake up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2522
02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:48.970
<v Speaker 1>it might be once every week or two and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden I can feel my heart</v>

2523
02:00:48.971 --> 02:00:53.080
<v Speaker 1>pounding and I could feel like this</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible energy in my hands and my</v>

2524
02:00:53.081 --> 02:00:56.770
<v Speaker 1>body and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in this hypo manic state and I,</v>

2525
02:00:57.090 --> 02:00:58.150
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it feels good.</v>

2526
02:00:58.151 --> 02:00:59.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't even realize it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going around,</v>

2527
02:00:59.501 --> 02:01:01.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited about stuff and I'm just</v>

2528
02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:03.120
<v Speaker 1>jacked up on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

2529
02:01:03.370 --> 02:01:07.510
<v Speaker 1>on this energy and it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what comes up must go down.</v>

2530
02:01:07.540 --> 02:01:11.790
<v Speaker 1>So I usually like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then what will happen is I realized</v>

2531
02:01:11.791 --> 02:01:13.550
<v Speaker 1>they know that I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've exaggerated like,</v>

2532
02:01:13.551 --> 02:01:14.770
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gone into something that I had been</v>

2533
02:01:15.220 --> 02:01:18.190
<v Speaker 1>too aggressive of a situation or have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been exaggerating some situation where I</v>

2534
02:01:18.191 --> 02:01:22.150
<v Speaker 1>got grind grandiose about something and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel super embarrassed that I was in</v>

2535
02:01:22.151 --> 02:01:24.910
<v Speaker 1>this sort of like high and in a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2536
02:01:24.970 --> 02:01:26.860
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't have my shit together at</v>

2537
02:01:26.861 --> 02:01:28.900
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I ended up in the downswing,</v>

2538
02:01:28.930 --> 02:01:31.720
<v Speaker 1>which is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the catastrophizing,</v>

2539
02:01:31.750 --> 02:01:32.660
<v Speaker 1>the like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2540
02:01:32.830 --> 02:01:34.230
<v Speaker 1>the despair sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2541
02:01:34.360 --> 02:01:36.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said Lenny lose like that thing about</v>

2542
02:01:36.791 --> 02:01:39.230
<v Speaker 1>being in the center that was talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about when it's there,</v>

2543
02:01:39.231 --> 02:01:42.890
<v Speaker 1>it's so true and it's so there and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a sudden I'm not there at all.</v>

2544
02:01:42.891 --> 02:01:44.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

2545
02:01:44.151 --> 02:01:47.720
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's no meaning to</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything and I am just in this</v>

2546
02:01:47.721 --> 02:01:51.890
<v Speaker 1>desolation thing and that last for a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours or like a day or something and</v>

2547
02:01:51.891 --> 02:01:55.490
<v Speaker 1>then I'll pop out and I'm fine and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that once a week or once every</v>

2548
02:01:55.490 --> 02:01:56.151
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two weeks or something,</v>

2549
02:01:56.151 --> 02:01:57.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go into that cycle.</v>

2550
02:01:57.560 --> 02:01:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Now I've done my whole life without</v>
<v Speaker 1>having.</v>

2551
02:02:00.020 --> 02:02:02.000
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to manage it entirely with</v>
<v Speaker 1>meditation,</v>

2552
02:02:02.270 --> 02:02:05.270
<v Speaker 1>with exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with diet and I may just continue to</v>

2553
02:02:05.271 --> 02:02:07.190
<v Speaker 1>keep doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you gotten better at it?</v>

2554
02:02:07.250 --> 02:02:09.770
<v Speaker 1>I have got well so I have gotten better</v>
<v Speaker 1>at managing it.</v>

2555
02:02:09.860 --> 02:02:12.710
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely no question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten way better at not believing</v>

2556
02:02:12.711 --> 02:02:15.680
<v Speaker 1>in it when I'm in a high and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>believing when I'm in the down.</v>

2557
02:02:15.710 --> 02:02:17.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to interrupt you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thought process,</v>

2558
02:02:17.871 --> 02:02:19.490
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it kicks in,</v>

2559
02:02:19.491 --> 02:02:21.350
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you aware of it?</v>

2560
02:02:21.410 --> 02:02:23.620
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it starts as well.</v>

2561
02:02:23.630 --> 02:02:25.550
<v Speaker 1>I am because I start this energy in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

2562
02:02:25.551 --> 02:02:27.050
<v Speaker 1>so I feel the vibrating this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2563
02:02:27.051 --> 02:02:29.450
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the first my early warning sign</v>

2564
02:02:29.830 --> 02:02:33.350
<v Speaker 1>and then it gets bigger and bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is it's addictive because</v>

2565
02:02:33.351 --> 02:02:34.640
<v Speaker 1>you do you mind on your heart rate?</v>

2566
02:02:34.670 --> 02:02:36.620
<v Speaker 1>While this is how I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can feel the fucking heart</v>

2567
02:02:36.621 --> 02:02:40.640
<v Speaker 1>sometimes is going like a Jackhammer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>other times the heart it cools out,</v>

2568
02:02:40.641 --> 02:02:44.240
<v Speaker 1>but that it's like the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the power is still there,</v>

2569
02:02:44.241 --> 02:02:46.790
<v Speaker 1>the feeling of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's that feeling of power which</v>

2570
02:02:46.791 --> 02:02:49.340
<v Speaker 1>is very workout when that hits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's too.</v>

2571
02:02:49.341 --> 02:02:51.470
<v Speaker 1>That is what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hit a punching bag and it's the best.</v>

2572
02:02:51.700 --> 02:02:53.210
<v Speaker 1>So I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has been the best thing in the</v>

2573
02:02:53.211 --> 02:02:56.870
<v Speaker 1>world for me is been hitting a punching</v>
<v Speaker 1>bag and it's men meditation can't do</v>

2574
02:02:56.871 --> 02:02:58.280
<v Speaker 1>shit when I'm in that place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2575
02:02:58.340 --> 02:03:01.130
<v Speaker 1>But punching bag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel calm and centered afterwards.</v>

2576
02:03:01.131 --> 02:03:03.020
<v Speaker 1>So that is the main intervention of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing.</v>

2577
02:03:03.290 --> 02:03:07.190
<v Speaker 1>I may never go the med route.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I can handle it like I've been</v>

2578
02:03:07.191 --> 02:03:10.580
<v Speaker 1>doing it until now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what makes me want to do it is I</v>

2579
02:03:10.581 --> 02:03:12.110
<v Speaker 1>want to know what other people have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with.</v>

2580
02:03:12.170 --> 02:03:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Like I want to know what is like to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>on those things and what and so I can</v>

2581
02:03:15.980 --> 02:03:19.070
<v Speaker 1>help those people maximally and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I can tell you about what</v>

2582
02:03:19.071 --> 02:03:21.890
<v Speaker 1>meditation can do and this is what I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you about what it can't do.</v>

2583
02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:24.350
<v Speaker 1>This is what I can tell you about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical practice can help,</v>

2584
02:03:24.351 --> 02:03:26.900
<v Speaker 1>but how they might not be able to help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I can say about how meds</v>

2585
02:03:26.901 --> 02:03:30.080
<v Speaker 1>have helped and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I can have good experience with</v>

2586
02:03:30.081 --> 02:03:32.600
<v Speaker 1>those different things and talk to lots</v>
<v Speaker 1>of other people who've done it,</v>

2587
02:03:32.900 --> 02:03:35.660
<v Speaker 1>then I can triangulate it on helping</v>
<v Speaker 1>people almost in a,</v>

2588
02:03:35.750 --> 02:03:38.510
<v Speaker 1>in a more effective way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you get these surges,</v>

2589
02:03:38.540 --> 02:03:41.810
<v Speaker 1>you get this energy surge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you exercise,</v>

2590
02:03:41.811 --> 02:03:43.760
<v Speaker 1>you hit the bag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel great.</v>

2591
02:03:43.870 --> 02:03:45.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that even everything out?</v>

2592
02:03:45.590 --> 02:03:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2593
02:03:46.250 --> 02:03:48.860
<v Speaker 1>I usually take it can discharge the</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>

2594
02:03:48.980 --> 02:03:50.450
<v Speaker 1>Then why on earth would you be thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about?</v>

2595
02:03:51.560 --> 02:03:54.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems insane because then as a very</v>

2596
02:03:54.021 --> 02:03:57.200
<v Speaker 1>organic solution to this problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know that it'll always will</v>

2597
02:03:57.201 --> 02:03:59.420
<v Speaker 1>work with the punching bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's working right now.</v>

2598
02:03:59.421 --> 02:04:01.160
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't perfectly worked every time.</v>

2599
02:04:01.630 --> 02:04:02.463
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's.</v>

2600
02:04:02.740 --> 02:04:05.840
<v Speaker 1>When you say it hasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I go and I hit the bags and</v>

2601
02:04:05.841 --> 02:04:09.320
<v Speaker 1>afterwards the energy's still in me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may not have the same edge,</v>

2602
02:04:09.321 --> 02:04:11.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can still feel it.</v>

2603
02:04:11.690 --> 02:04:15.560
<v Speaker 1>And when you say energy is really</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting to someone who doesn't get</v>

2604
02:04:15.561 --> 02:04:17.480
<v Speaker 1>the surges I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to like,</v>

2605
02:04:18.260 --> 02:04:20.390
<v Speaker 1>um.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like you're on caffeine?</v>

2606
02:04:20.420 --> 02:04:24.350
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like a speed speed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels like a nowhere.</v>

2607
02:04:24.351 --> 02:04:27.170
<v Speaker 1>So you wake up and you're on speed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on speed and it's like.</v>

2608
02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:28.670
<v Speaker 1>And there's nothing I did externally.</v>

2609
02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:30.260
<v Speaker 1>Nothing happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't take anything.</v>

2610
02:04:30.261 --> 02:04:32.670
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do anything all of a sudden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the things.</v>

2611
02:04:32.690 --> 02:04:35.030
<v Speaker 1>There are corresponding thought process</v>
<v Speaker 1>that goes with this.</v>

2612
02:04:35.031 --> 02:04:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Is there a zest for life is fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life is awesome to me.</v>

2613
02:04:38.701 --> 02:04:39.900
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to go kick some ass.</v>

2614
02:04:40.500 --> 02:04:42.750
<v Speaker 1>It's pure exuberance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds great.</v>

2615
02:04:42.751 --> 02:04:44.640
<v Speaker 1>It is great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's the problem of it.</v>

2616
02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:46.680
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you feed it so you're like,</v>

2617
02:04:46.681 --> 02:04:47.920
<v Speaker 1>you want more of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you just,</v>

2618
02:04:47.950 --> 02:04:50.220
<v Speaker 1>it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically it's like this.</v>

2619
02:04:50.250 --> 02:04:52.020
<v Speaker 1>It's also not always great for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people around.</v>

2620
02:04:52.021 --> 02:04:53.190
<v Speaker 1>It's not always great for the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

2621
02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:55.110
<v Speaker 1>You were like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2622
02:04:55.440 --> 02:04:59.820
<v Speaker 1>We have our ups and downs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like from foom foom and the more</v>

2623
02:04:59.821 --> 02:05:02.550
<v Speaker 1>you feed the up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the higher you go,</v>

2624
02:05:02.580 --> 02:05:04.560
<v Speaker 1>but that means that the bigger you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fall.</v>

2625
02:05:04.980 --> 02:05:07.350
<v Speaker 1>So like that's what I've learned is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

2626
02:05:07.500 --> 02:05:10.980
<v Speaker 1>when I feed the grandiosity of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy that exuberance,</v>

2627
02:05:11.190 --> 02:05:14.130
<v Speaker 1>like I'm super fun to be with at parties</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

2628
02:05:14.130 --> 02:05:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll do crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's usually when I've had all my</v>

2629
02:05:16.531 --> 02:05:18.540
<v Speaker 1>injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my various breaks because I've been on</v>

2630
02:05:18.541 --> 02:05:20.790
<v Speaker 1>one of these crazy high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's another reason not to do it.</v>

2631
02:05:21.180 --> 02:05:23.880
<v Speaker 1>But inevitably there's gonna be a part</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's going to crash.</v>

2632
02:05:23.881 --> 02:05:27.000
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now my whole job is from being a</v>

2633
02:05:27.001 --> 02:05:30.930
<v Speaker 1>meditation teacher is I feel the energy</v>
<v Speaker 1>start to come up and I back off.</v>

2634
02:05:31.140 --> 02:05:33.510
<v Speaker 1>So it's like I let it just come through</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

2635
02:05:33.511 --> 02:05:38.370
<v Speaker 1>I try to let it just come up like a wave</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just and I and I and it's really</v>

2636
02:05:38.371 --> 02:05:41.490
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable being in that vibrating</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy and not acting on it,</v>

2637
02:05:41.491 --> 02:05:45.960
<v Speaker 1>not saying some stupid shit or not like</v>
<v Speaker 1>being more whatever,</v>

2638
02:05:45.961 --> 02:05:48.660
<v Speaker 1>not acting on it and keeping it going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to kind of let it.</v>

2639
02:05:48.720 --> 02:05:52.770
<v Speaker 1>So I just try to keep myself calm and</v>
<v Speaker 1>centered and I try to let it just feed</v>

2640
02:05:52.771 --> 02:05:56.580
<v Speaker 1>itself fruit now with the punching bag</v>
<v Speaker 1>or with the biking and with these things</v>

2641
02:05:56.640 --> 02:05:58.500
<v Speaker 1>that really can help with that process.</v>

2642
02:05:58.500 --> 02:06:01.890
<v Speaker 1>So I do think I might be on the verge of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2643
02:06:01.940 --> 02:06:03.240
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I won't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2644
02:06:03.241 --> 02:06:05.700
<v Speaker 1>maybe I won't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know because it's.</v>

2645
02:06:05.730 --> 02:06:08.550
<v Speaker 1>The thing is dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking hard being at tufts to</v>

2646
02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:10.740
<v Speaker 1>anyone who is bipolar or be those ups</v>
<v Speaker 1>and downs.</v>

2647
02:06:10.741 --> 02:06:13.740
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to be in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exhausting every week.</v>

2648
02:06:13.741 --> 02:06:14.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wake up,</v>

2649
02:06:14.821 --> 02:06:16.080
<v Speaker 1>you don't know who you're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>this week.</v>

2650
02:06:16.081 --> 02:06:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Who am I going to be today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or what?</v>

2651
02:06:17.730 --> 02:06:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Or if you're in a down place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like now you've made all these plans</v>

2652
02:06:20.341 --> 02:06:21.900
<v Speaker 1>with somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you got to cancel the plans,</v>

2653
02:06:21.980 --> 02:06:23.340
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking,</v>

2654
02:06:23.341 --> 02:06:27.120
<v Speaker 1>you were saying this is a slightly</v>
<v Speaker 1>bipolar situation for you.</v>

2655
02:06:27.410 --> 02:06:29.870
<v Speaker 1>This is so it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the bipolar,</v>

2656
02:06:30.080 --> 02:06:30.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them,</v>

2657
02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:32.370
<v Speaker 1>there's bipolar one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bipolar two.</v>

2658
02:06:32.371 --> 02:06:37.371
<v Speaker 1>One is more extreme like real mania</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you go and fucking buy 50 couches</v>

2659
02:06:37.741 --> 02:06:38.491
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey honey,</v>

2660
02:06:38.491 --> 02:06:39.480
<v Speaker 1>I bought 50 couches.</v>

2661
02:06:39.480 --> 02:06:40.890
<v Speaker 1>We're going to put couches all over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood.</v>

2662
02:06:40.891 --> 02:06:43.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your classic Manic episode.</v>

2663
02:06:43.530 --> 02:06:45.870
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't go for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never had that happen.</v>

2664
02:06:45.871 --> 02:06:47.730
<v Speaker 1>I just have the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Hypomania.</v>

2665
02:06:47.731 --> 02:06:51.720
<v Speaker 1>So like the lots of the energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't go into total craziness.</v>

2666
02:06:51.840 --> 02:06:54.360
<v Speaker 1>And biologically what is the process</v>
<v Speaker 1>like?</v>

2667
02:06:54.361 --> 02:06:57.060
<v Speaker 1>What is actually happening to you that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>causing this?</v>

2668
02:06:57.120 --> 02:06:58.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2669
02:06:58.950 --> 02:07:00.640
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't understand that.</v>

2670
02:07:01.170 --> 02:07:02.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is new for me.</v>

2671
02:07:02.880 --> 02:07:04.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just found out two weeks.</v>

2672
02:07:04.381 --> 02:07:07.050
<v Speaker 1>So I haven't really done the research on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain science yet.</v>

2673
02:07:07.080 --> 02:07:10.530
<v Speaker 1>They do say there's a brain signature</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like there is for add,</v>

2674
02:07:10.800 --> 02:07:13.680
<v Speaker 1>for bipolar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a particular signature of what,</v>

2675
02:07:14.160 --> 02:07:15.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what it looks like.</v>

2676
02:07:15.601 --> 02:07:17.730
<v Speaker 1>It has some kind of dampening of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>frontal activity.</v>

2677
02:07:17.731 --> 02:07:21.420
<v Speaker 1>So probably a lot of activation in maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Amygdala or something.</v>

2678
02:07:21.421 --> 02:07:22.254
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2679
02:07:22.410 --> 02:07:24.090
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all I know is from the inside,</v>

2680
02:07:24.270 --> 02:07:26.780
<v Speaker 1>it really feels different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels like a,</v>

2681
02:07:27.290 --> 02:07:28.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

2682
02:07:28.550 --> 02:07:29.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure people can relate.</v>

2683
02:07:29.791 --> 02:07:33.030
<v Speaker 1>Like when you've had a coffee and you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>got that vibrating energy or,</v>

2684
02:07:33.420 --> 02:07:36.670
<v Speaker 1>or you have or feeling super confident</v>
<v Speaker 1>about yourself,</v>

2685
02:07:36.671 --> 02:07:38.620
<v Speaker 1>but it's almost like your confidence</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes too far.</v>

2686
02:07:39.070 --> 02:07:41.710
<v Speaker 1>You're a little bit like overconfident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2687
02:07:41.711 --> 02:07:43.300
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're delusional,</v>

2688
02:07:43.330 --> 02:07:44.400
<v Speaker 1>delusional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>

2689
02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:46.870
<v Speaker 1>and then that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that actually happens in meditation</v>

2690
02:07:46.871 --> 02:07:49.720
<v Speaker 1>to that stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the upstage of meditation than to be</v>

2691
02:07:49.721 --> 02:07:52.810
<v Speaker 1>called the arising and passing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get to a stage where suddenly</v>

2692
02:07:52.811 --> 02:07:54.610
<v Speaker 1>you really feel like you get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

2693
02:07:54.611 --> 02:07:55.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

2694
02:07:55.511 --> 02:07:56.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like what Dan said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2695
02:07:56.510 --> 02:07:58.210
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna put a fucking plaque here</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the wall.</v>

2696
02:07:58.211 --> 02:08:00.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm the best meditator on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like because you got,</v>

2697
02:08:00.880 --> 02:08:02.200
<v Speaker 1>you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just,</v>

2698
02:08:02.560 --> 02:08:06.970
<v Speaker 1>all the energy is coming through you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then inevitably there was the crash.</v>

2699
02:08:06.971 --> 02:08:10.270
<v Speaker 1>So actually that is why I didn't get</v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnosed for so long.</v>

2700
02:08:10.271 --> 02:08:12.550
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was just meditation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was,</v>

2701
02:08:12.610 --> 02:08:16.450
<v Speaker 1>I was just noticing the cycles because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my meditation and it was really just</v>

2702
02:08:16.451 --> 02:08:19.030
<v Speaker 1>add.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't until it started just to</v>

2703
02:08:19.031 --> 02:08:20.320
<v Speaker 1>become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started to see,</v>

2704
02:08:20.321 --> 02:08:21.790
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a real pattern here.</v>

2705
02:08:21.791 --> 02:08:25.690
<v Speaker 1>Like I need to just talk to somebody and</v>
<v Speaker 1>get some other perspectives on this.</v>

2706
02:08:26.290 --> 02:08:30.580
<v Speaker 3>I just might make it worth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's worth pointing out that it's highly</v>

2707
02:08:30.581 --> 02:08:34.210
<v Speaker 3>unusual and very courageous for somebody</v>
<v Speaker 3>in juxtaposition.</v>

2708
02:08:34.300 --> 02:08:36.250
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's highly unusual for anybody to talk</v>

2709
02:08:36.251 --> 02:08:39.700
<v Speaker 3>about having mental difficulties at all</v>
<v Speaker 3>in our culture.</v>

2710
02:08:40.090 --> 02:08:42.070
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need more people who are willing to</v>

2711
02:08:42.071 --> 02:08:42.940
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2712
02:08:42.941 --> 02:08:45.640
<v Speaker 3>I deal with anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>depression,</v>

2713
02:08:45.700 --> 02:08:47.120
<v Speaker 3>bipolar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2714
02:08:47.470 --> 02:08:50.380
<v Speaker 3>add.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for somebody who's a meditation</v>

2715
02:08:50.381 --> 02:08:54.310
<v Speaker 3>teacher to do it because as jeff has</v>
<v Speaker 3>said that the traditional understanding</v>

2716
02:08:54.311 --> 02:08:58.570
<v Speaker 3>of meditation teacher is someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 3>got their shit together on every level.</v>

2717
02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:01.810
<v Speaker 3>For somebody who's a meditation teacher</v>
<v Speaker 3>to deal to come out and say,</v>

2718
02:09:01.811 --> 02:09:03.310
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have these challenges.</v>

2719
02:09:03.460 --> 02:09:08.460
<v Speaker 3>He's incredibly brave and also really</v>
<v Speaker 3>important because I think and,</v>

2720
02:09:08.661 --> 02:09:10.420
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and working with Jeff on writing this</v>

2721
02:09:10.421 --> 02:09:11.960
<v Speaker 3>book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things you know,</v>

2722
02:09:11.970 --> 02:09:16.300
<v Speaker 3>there were times when the patterns that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's describing were very annoying to me</v>

2723
02:09:16.301 --> 02:09:19.420
<v Speaker 3>to deal with as his coauthor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but over time it actually,</v>

2724
02:09:19.480 --> 02:09:22.480
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started to see that he was wrestling</v>

2725
02:09:22.481 --> 02:09:25.780
<v Speaker 3>with this stuff and in many ways it felt</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a meditation teacher.</v>

2726
02:09:26.220 --> 02:09:28.930
<v Speaker 3>It was obvious to me that he is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>meditation teacher with Imposter</v>

2727
02:09:28.930 --> 02:09:32.450
<v Speaker 3>Syndrome and now I think he gets in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you can hear it and what he's</v>

2728
02:09:32.470 --> 02:09:35.170
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that actually these challenges make them</v>

2729
02:09:35.171 --> 02:09:38.200
<v Speaker 3>a better teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That he's more in touch with the things</v>

2730
02:09:38.201 --> 02:09:39.910
<v Speaker 3>that we're all dealing with and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes on,</v>

2731
02:09:40.580 --> 02:09:45.580
<v Speaker 3>on an exponentially higher level of</v>
<v Speaker 3>degree of difficulty and that therefore</v>

2732
02:09:45.611 --> 02:09:49.120
<v Speaker 3>he better at getting under the hood and</v>
<v Speaker 3>helping other people with their mental</v>

2733
02:09:49.121 --> 02:09:49.840
<v Speaker 3>challenge.</v>

2734
02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:52.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like so in many ways like what you were</v>

2735
02:09:52.601 --> 02:09:56.080
<v Speaker 1>experiencing for your own profession is</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost a gift.</v>

2736
02:09:56.110 --> 02:09:57.140
<v Speaker 1>It's why I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2737
02:09:57.820 --> 02:10:02.800
<v Speaker 1>because you have this unique opportunity</v>
<v Speaker 1>to explore your own consciousness in a</v>

2738
02:10:02.801 --> 02:10:06.730
<v Speaker 1>very challenging way and also to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely honest about it,</v>

2739
02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:09.940
<v Speaker 1>which is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very beneficial to not just your</v>

2740
02:10:09.941 --> 02:10:11.170
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of the people that are</v>

2741
02:10:11.171 --> 02:10:12.820
<v Speaker 1>listening to this right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's now,</v>

2742
02:10:13.090 --> 02:10:16.530
<v Speaker 1>it's now it's living inside the snout</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you get.</v>

2743
02:10:16.570 --> 02:10:18.820
<v Speaker 1>It's more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just makes everything more dramatic</v>

2744
02:10:18.990 --> 02:10:22.420
<v Speaker 1>so you can see the dynamics because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>so frigging dramatic and you.</v>

2745
02:10:22.630 --> 02:10:25.630
<v Speaker 1>You're then able to see the more subtle</v>
<v Speaker 1>way it plays out for everyone because</v>

2746
02:10:25.990 --> 02:10:28.540
<v Speaker 1>the stuff I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just the human condition hand.</v>

2747
02:10:28.930 --> 02:10:31.510
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's got [inaudible] is struggling</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a version of this.</v>

2748
02:10:31.511 --> 02:10:34.040
<v Speaker 1>It may not be to that extreme thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they but they got it or they have an</v>

2749
02:10:34.041 --> 02:10:35.510
<v Speaker 1>orthogonal challenge over here.</v>

2750
02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:37.580
<v Speaker 1>It's something a little bit different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're.</v>

2751
02:10:37.960 --> 02:10:41.060
<v Speaker 1>You're continually training your</v>
<v Speaker 1>compassion for how hard it can be in</v>

2752
02:10:41.061 --> 02:10:42.350
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're also learning very</v>

2753
02:10:42.351 --> 02:10:44.630
<v Speaker 1>practically how to work with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dynamics of that stuff.</v>

2754
02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:49.400
<v Speaker 1>Is the downside of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reaction to the upside or is there a</v>

2755
02:10:49.401 --> 02:10:53.420
<v Speaker 1>corresponding physical feeling?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of it as like a rope,</v>

2756
02:10:53.990 --> 02:10:54.640
<v Speaker 1>like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2757
02:10:54.640 --> 02:10:57.380
<v Speaker 1>you got things like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just physics will come.</v>

2758
02:10:57.440 --> 02:11:01.220
<v Speaker 1>It's just what comes up must come down</v>
<v Speaker 1>and mine is a bit unusual in that it's,</v>

2759
02:11:01.221 --> 02:11:02.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm more up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a ton of.</v>

2760
02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:05.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't stay down long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds great.</v>

2761
02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:08.150
<v Speaker 1>So that's why it took so long to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnosed.</v>

2762
02:11:08.151 --> 02:11:10.670
<v Speaker 1>But then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But trust me that being up all is</v>

2763
02:11:10.671 --> 02:11:11.840
<v Speaker 1>deranged too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2764
02:11:11.870 --> 02:11:14.480
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2765
02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:16.370
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go back sometimes I had an experience</v>

2766
02:11:16.371 --> 02:11:17.930
<v Speaker 1>where I just was trying to fix up my</v>
<v Speaker 1>website,</v>

2767
02:11:17.940 --> 02:11:21.960
<v Speaker 1>look back at an old talk I did and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I was videos in this big room and</v>

2768
02:11:21.961 --> 02:11:22.794
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

2769
02:11:22.830 --> 02:11:24.030
<v Speaker 1>I was so manic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2770
02:11:24.100 --> 02:11:25.940
<v Speaker 1>I just thought I was crazy because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2771
02:11:25.941 --> 02:11:29.030
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck was I doing about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>memos you sent me when we're in the</v>

2772
02:11:29.031 --> 02:11:31.010
<v Speaker 1>book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So say some credit.</v>

2773
02:11:31.090 --> 02:11:36.090
<v Speaker 1>What was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was so crazy about the males?</v>

2774
02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:37.890
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2775
02:11:38.150 --> 02:11:39.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2776
02:11:39.231 --> 02:11:40.160
<v Speaker 1>do you want to explain it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2777
02:11:40.190 --> 02:11:43.520
<v Speaker 3>So we will be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a book we wrote is for</v>

2778
02:11:43.521 --> 02:11:47.420
<v Speaker 3>beginners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted it to be really simple and know</v>

2779
02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:52.160
<v Speaker 3>we were doing it on a crazy deadline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we did a road trip across the country</v>

2780
02:11:52.520 --> 02:11:55.880
<v Speaker 3>in January 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so not long ago.</v>

2781
02:11:56.270 --> 02:11:59.660
<v Speaker 3>And at the end of the road trip we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we recorded all of it.</v>

2782
02:11:59.730 --> 02:12:03.230
<v Speaker 3>We got the transcripts back and we had</v>
<v Speaker 3>to hand the book in in June.</v>

2783
02:12:03.620 --> 02:12:06.260
<v Speaker 3>That set me up on a schedule where I had</v>
<v Speaker 3>to write a chapter a week,</v>

2784
02:12:06.290 --> 02:12:10.280
<v Speaker 3>which is insane because I have an anchor</v>
<v Speaker 3>to shows at ABC and I have a wife and a</v>

2785
02:12:10.281 --> 02:12:13.460
<v Speaker 3>child and it will be insane even if I</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't have that.</v>

2786
02:12:13.700 --> 02:12:16.340
<v Speaker 3>And so my job was to write the</v>
<v Speaker 3>narrative,</v>

2787
02:12:16.341 --> 02:12:19.010
<v Speaker 3>the overarching structure of the book</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Jeff was going to write the</v>

2788
02:12:19.011 --> 02:12:21.200
<v Speaker 3>meditation instructions that got</v>
<v Speaker 3>inserted in.</v>

2789
02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:25.970
<v Speaker 3>And all I wanted from him was to give me</v>
<v Speaker 3>some basic fucking meditation</v>

2790
02:12:25.971 --> 02:12:26.480
<v Speaker 3>instructions.</v>

2791
02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:31.480
<v Speaker 3>I did not want an exit Jesus on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on like the pawnee shots,</v>

2792
02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I didn't need him to go through and</v>

2793
02:12:34.611 --> 02:12:38.920
<v Speaker 3>explain to me like the whole Pali Canon</v>
<v Speaker 3>from Buddhism or the,</v>

2794
02:12:38.990 --> 02:12:42.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do his version of the Bhagavad Gita.</v>

2795
02:12:42.350 --> 02:12:46.520
<v Speaker 3>But he would send me these memos with</v>
<v Speaker 3>his grandiose,</v>

2796
02:12:46.521 --> 02:12:49.550
<v Speaker 3>he'd be on a medic upswing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he would have these ideas about how</v>

2797
02:12:49.730 --> 02:12:52.700
<v Speaker 3>he was going to explain meditation as</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's never been explained before as a</v>

2798
02:12:52.701 --> 02:12:55.130
<v Speaker 3>series of exfoliation of the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

2799
02:12:55.131 --> 02:12:55.821
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

2800
02:12:55.821 --> 02:12:59.840
<v Speaker 3>17 page,</v>
<v Speaker 3>17 pages of life of like tightly,</v>

2801
02:13:00.110 --> 02:13:01.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because like you get the energy comes up</v>

2802
02:13:01.741 --> 02:13:04.010
<v Speaker 3>and he gets super excited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm just pumped and want to talk</v>

2803
02:13:04.011 --> 02:13:07.100
<v Speaker 3>about all these little kind of like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>complicated bits and put it all together</v>

2804
02:13:07.101 --> 02:13:10.430
<v Speaker 3>and create this really elaborate</v>
<v Speaker 3>scaffolding and a metaphor to describe</v>

2805
02:13:10.431 --> 02:13:11.740
<v Speaker 3>exactly how the mind works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2806
02:13:12.100 --> 02:13:13.720
<v Speaker 1>and that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2807
02:13:14.010 --> 02:13:16.090
<v Speaker 1>that's why I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I didn't get the book done</v>

2808
02:13:16.091 --> 02:13:18.790
<v Speaker 1>before I was working on with Dan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent 10 years working on this book</v>

2809
02:13:18.791 --> 02:13:20.710
<v Speaker 1>about enlightenment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the,</v>

2810
02:13:20.711 --> 02:13:22.900
<v Speaker 1>about the progress of insight and</v>
<v Speaker 1>meditation.</v>

2811
02:13:23.500 --> 02:13:26.500
<v Speaker 1>And I just kept getting more and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated and more because I kept.</v>

2812
02:13:26.860 --> 02:13:29.170
<v Speaker 1>I would kind of simplify it and get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be very sane.</v>

2813
02:13:29.180 --> 02:13:31.260
<v Speaker 1>I have it all understood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I would suddenly go one of</v>

2814
02:13:31.290 --> 02:13:32.250
<v Speaker 1>those episodes</v>

2815
02:13:32.250 --> 02:13:34.010
<v Speaker 3>and it would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would explode it all and like</v>

2816
02:13:34.290 --> 02:13:37.650
<v Speaker 3>elaborate whole new dimensions of stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was like I would never get</v>

2817
02:13:37.651 --> 02:13:39.000
<v Speaker 3>anything done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2818
02:13:39.010 --> 02:13:41.160
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I want to say in your defense that</v>

2819
02:13:41.161 --> 02:13:42.480
<v Speaker 3>the memo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I've gone back and read the</v>

2820
02:13:42.481 --> 02:13:43.980
<v Speaker 3>memos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're great.</v>

2821
02:13:44.370 --> 02:13:48.930
<v Speaker 3>It's just not what I needed while</v>
<v Speaker 3>writing a very simple book on a deadline</v>

2822
02:13:48.990 --> 02:13:50.620
<v Speaker 3>and I would get these memos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look,</v>

2823
02:13:50.640 --> 02:13:55.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what to do with this and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that actually you're putting</v>

2824
02:13:55.090 --> 02:13:57.750
<v Speaker 3>your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that is the reason why the ops are</v>

2825
02:13:57.751 --> 02:13:59.550
<v Speaker 3>challenging because when you're in an</v>
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>

2826
02:13:59.940 --> 02:14:01.660
<v Speaker 3>you're not really seeing the world as it</v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

2827
02:14:01.860 --> 02:14:04.230
<v Speaker 3>Like this is a person who needs a very</v>
<v Speaker 3>particular thing.</v>

2828
02:14:04.500 --> 02:14:07.110
<v Speaker 3>If you're just centered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that you respond with that,</v>

2829
02:14:07.111 --> 02:14:11.460
<v Speaker 3>but you're in your own story about</v>
<v Speaker 3>something and that is the part that's so</v>

2830
02:14:11.461 --> 02:14:15.840
<v Speaker 3>pernicious or are dangerous about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the ops and you know,</v>

2831
02:14:15.930 --> 02:14:17.190
<v Speaker 3>and so that.</v>

2832
02:14:17.190 --> 02:14:18.810
<v Speaker 3>And that happened in the process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to book,</v>

2833
02:14:18.811 --> 02:14:20.700
<v Speaker 3>but then we got to sort it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

2834
02:14:20.701 --> 02:14:21.660
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

2835
02:14:21.661 --> 02:14:23.730
<v Speaker 3>I know there's something about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2836
02:14:24.270 --> 02:14:26.890
<v Speaker 3>being on an upswing like that and in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this kind of,</v>

2837
02:14:27.030 --> 02:14:28.890
<v Speaker 3>for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just jeff and we're picking on</v>

2838
02:14:28.891 --> 02:14:29.930
<v Speaker 3>Jeff here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when we,</v>

2839
02:14:30.030 --> 02:14:35.030
<v Speaker 3>any of us is on an upswing or any of us</v>
<v Speaker 3>has just caught in any mental state.</v>

2840
02:14:35.460 --> 02:14:36.590
<v Speaker 3>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

2841
02:14:36.650 --> 02:14:39.840
<v Speaker 3>your capacity for empathy and compassion</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes way down because you're stuck in</v>

2842
02:14:39.841 --> 02:14:42.360
<v Speaker 3>your own story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2843
02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:45.180
<v Speaker 3>the name of the game here at the end of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the day,</v>

2844
02:14:45.181 --> 02:14:49.860
<v Speaker 3>not withstanding by already stated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>misgivings about words like compassion.</v>

2845
02:14:50.130 --> 02:14:54.360
<v Speaker 3>That is where the rubber hits the road</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you can talk about performance</v>

2846
02:14:54.361 --> 02:14:58.740
<v Speaker 3>that is important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think the real measuring stick for</v>

2847
02:14:58.741 --> 02:15:01.710
<v Speaker 3>how well you've trained your mind is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you an asshole?</v>

2848
02:15:04.670 --> 02:15:05.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's huge,</v>

2849
02:15:05.700 --> 02:15:06.630
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2850
02:15:06.740 --> 02:15:09.890
<v Speaker 3>how well are you interacting with other</v>
<v Speaker 3>people?</v>

2851
02:15:10.710 --> 02:15:13.710
<v Speaker 3>That is the money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you care enough about other people to</v>

2852
02:15:13.711 --> 02:15:15.230
<v Speaker 3>actually see who they are?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2853
02:15:15.270 --> 02:15:17.390
<v Speaker 3>To see the character in their face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2854
02:15:17.460 --> 02:15:18.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

2855
02:15:18.010 --> 02:15:20.930
<v Speaker 3>what they're really telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you actually get out of your.</v>

2856
02:15:20.931 --> 02:15:23.700
<v Speaker 3>You just get out of your own bullshit</v>
<v Speaker 3>and see what's going on in front of you.</v>

2857
02:15:24.510 --> 02:15:25.690
<v Speaker 3>That's the name of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

2858
02:15:25.691 --> 02:15:28.770
<v Speaker 3>and in the most awkward conversation did</v>
<v Speaker 3>you ever have or when people were just</v>

2859
02:15:28.771 --> 02:15:30.040
<v Speaker 3>talking at you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2860
02:15:30.220 --> 02:15:32.010
<v Speaker 3>Did Not even taking you into</v>
<v Speaker 3>consideration.</v>

2861
02:15:32.011 --> 02:15:33.570
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would you even talk to that person</v>

2862
02:15:33.571 --> 02:15:34.230
<v Speaker 3>anyway?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not.</v>

2863
02:15:34.230 --> 02:15:35.460
<v Speaker 3>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just talking to themselves,</v>

2864
02:15:35.490 --> 02:15:37.230
<v Speaker 3>but you got to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>

2865
02:15:37.260 --> 02:15:39.720
<v Speaker 3>it's about what this journey is often</v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

2866
02:15:39.721 --> 02:15:41.250
<v Speaker 3>Journey is another word that I don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>really like,</v>

2867
02:15:41.251 --> 02:15:43.980
<v Speaker 3>but what this exploration is all about.</v>

2868
02:15:43.980 --> 02:15:45.540
<v Speaker 3>Adventure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever you want to call it.</v>

2869
02:15:45.541 --> 02:15:49.260
<v Speaker 3>As I see sometimes I'm that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm that guy.</v>

2870
02:15:49.261 --> 02:15:51.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm not really listening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you got to see that.</v>

2871
02:15:52.170 --> 02:15:56.940
<v Speaker 3>You have to see that stuff in yourself</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of just complaining about it in</v>

2872
02:15:56.941 --> 02:16:00.930
<v Speaker 3>others in order to really get to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the good stuff,</v>

2873
02:16:00.931 --> 02:16:05.130
<v Speaker 3>which is actually then learning how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen and it's also like we're talking</v>

2874
02:16:05.131 --> 02:16:06.810
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very important for people to hear</v>

2875
02:16:06.811 --> 02:16:09.820
<v Speaker 3>because everybody's that guy sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2876
02:16:09.900 --> 02:16:13.500
<v Speaker 3>We may not want to admit it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and many of us liked to spend a lot of</v>

2877
02:16:13.501 --> 02:16:16.200
<v Speaker 3>time complaining about how everybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>else is a Schmuck,</v>

2878
02:16:16.230 --> 02:16:19.610
<v Speaker 3>but you got to see that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets back to the snout,</v>

2879
02:16:19.620 --> 02:16:21.120
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to see that stuff,</v>

2880
02:16:21.210 --> 02:16:23.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because actually that's the good stuff.</v>

2881
02:16:23.850 --> 02:16:25.710
<v Speaker 3>It's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there can be a real pleasure,</v>

2882
02:16:25.950 --> 02:16:30.100
<v Speaker 3>truly a pleasure in seeing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a great expression from this</v>

2883
02:16:30.220 --> 02:16:34.240
<v Speaker 3>eminent spiritual teacher named Rom Dasa</v>
<v Speaker 3>lives in Hawaii for your.</v>

2884
02:16:34.241 --> 02:16:35.710
<v Speaker 3>Many of your listeners may have heard of</v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

2885
02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:40.420
<v Speaker 3>He talks about how meditation doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>conquer your neuroses.</v>

2886
02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:43.300
<v Speaker 3>It makes you a connoisseur of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>neuroses.</v>

2887
02:16:43.630 --> 02:16:44.910
<v Speaker 3>You're like a Somali,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

2888
02:16:44.911 --> 02:16:48.040
<v Speaker 3>of your own insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a real pleasure every time</v>

2889
02:16:48.041 --> 02:16:51.860
<v Speaker 3>you see a anger come up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2890
02:16:51.880 --> 02:16:55.180
<v Speaker 3>or your own selfishness come up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2891
02:16:55.420 --> 02:16:58.360
<v Speaker 3>I see you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see that there's a real pleasure in</v>

2892
02:16:58.361 --> 02:17:00.460
<v Speaker 3>that because then in the scene you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>then not owned,</v>

2893
02:17:00.480 --> 02:17:02.530
<v Speaker 3>but you're not in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not in it.</v>

2894
02:17:04.270 --> 02:17:07.360
<v Speaker 3>That's playing the game well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's what this game is.</v>

2895
02:17:08.300 --> 02:17:09.710
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the uninitiated,</v>

2896
02:17:09.740 --> 02:17:14.740
<v Speaker 4>all this is very hard to absorb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're sitting back and listening this</v>

2897
02:17:15.111 --> 02:17:19.250
<v Speaker 4>long conversation and trying to put all</v>
<v Speaker 4>these pieces together.</v>

2898
02:17:20.310 --> 02:17:25.310
<v Speaker 3>What's the best first step to take</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually try meditation is the is the</v>

2899
02:17:26.161 --> 02:17:29.130
<v Speaker 3>best step to take and here's the thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>to know.</v>

2900
02:17:29.131 --> 02:17:33.840
<v Speaker 3>This doesn't require a ton of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I often point out to people that have</v>

2901
02:17:33.841 --> 02:17:36.840
<v Speaker 3>five to 10 minute a day habit is a great</v>
<v Speaker 3>habit.</v>

2902
02:17:36.841 --> 02:17:38.880
<v Speaker 3>I've spent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody wants to know what's the least</v>

2903
02:17:38.881 --> 02:17:42.960
<v Speaker 3>amount of meditation I can do and get</v>
<v Speaker 3>the advertise benefits of meditation.</v>

2904
02:17:42.990 --> 02:17:45.180
<v Speaker 3>All this stuff we've been talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>in high minded terms,</v>

2905
02:17:45.181 --> 02:17:48.390
<v Speaker 3>but there are some easier to comprehend</v>
<v Speaker 3>benefits from meditation,</v>

2906
02:17:48.391 --> 02:17:50.340
<v Speaker 3>lower blood pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boosted immune system,</v>

2907
02:17:50.760 --> 02:17:54.000
<v Speaker 3>literally rewiring key parts of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>brain that has to do with focus and</v>

2908
02:17:54.001 --> 02:17:56.970
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People want to know what's the least I</v>

2909
02:17:56.971 --> 02:17:58.980
<v Speaker 3>can do to get that good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I spent.</v>

2910
02:17:59.100 --> 02:18:02.640
<v Speaker 3>We haven't cracked that by we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the scientific community that</v>

2911
02:18:02.641 --> 02:18:04.440
<v Speaker 3>studies meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually part of it,</v>

2912
02:18:04.441 --> 02:18:06.390
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of these men and women,</v>

2913
02:18:06.810 --> 02:18:08.730
<v Speaker 3>they haven't figured out exactly what it</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

2914
02:18:08.731 --> 02:18:11.880
<v Speaker 3>what's the minimum dose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've asked them,</v>

2915
02:18:11.881 --> 02:18:13.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's five to 10 minutes,</v>

2916
02:18:13.021 --> 02:18:17.760
<v Speaker 3>probably enough in the general consensus</v>
<v Speaker 3>is probably enough to derive many of</v>

2917
02:18:17.761 --> 02:18:18.594
<v Speaker 3>these benefits.</v>

2918
02:18:18.750 --> 02:18:21.740
<v Speaker 3>But so that's the good news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think the even better news is if</v>

2919
02:18:21.820 --> 02:18:23.490
<v Speaker 3>five to 10 minutes sounds like too much</v>
<v Speaker 3>for you,</v>

2920
02:18:23.730 --> 02:18:27.560
<v Speaker 3>one minute most days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one minute daily ish,</v>

2921
02:18:27.900 --> 02:18:30.720
<v Speaker 3>is really enough to see what you need to</v>
<v Speaker 3>see.</v>

2922
02:18:31.650 --> 02:18:33.450
<v Speaker 3>What you need to see is that you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking crazy.</v>

2923
02:18:34.650 --> 02:18:38.070
<v Speaker 3>You need to see it over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the schnauzer getting his snout</v>

2924
02:18:38.071 --> 02:18:39.750
<v Speaker 3>put in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the poop.</v>

2925
02:18:40.110 --> 02:18:43.050
<v Speaker 3>You need to have that happen to you over</v>
<v Speaker 3>and over again.</v>

2926
02:18:43.051 --> 02:18:45.060
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because every time you see that,</v>

2927
02:18:45.061 --> 02:18:47.490
<v Speaker 3>every time you sit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to focus on your breath.</v>

2928
02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:50.940
<v Speaker 3>See that you've become distracted in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that moment.</v>

2929
02:18:51.450 --> 02:18:54.720
<v Speaker 3>That's the moment when most people think</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've failed at meditation is actually</v>

2930
02:18:54.721 --> 02:18:57.360
<v Speaker 3>the victory and when you see how crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are,</v>

2931
02:18:57.570 --> 02:19:01.050
<v Speaker 3>when you've become distracted and learn</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to start again and again and again.</v>

2932
02:19:01.140 --> 02:19:03.870
<v Speaker 3>Every time you see that you've become</v>
<v Speaker 3>distracted.</v>

2933
02:19:04.440 --> 02:19:08.910
<v Speaker 3>That's a win and it when have really</v>
<v Speaker 3>towering consequences because then you</v>

2934
02:19:08.911 --> 02:19:12.090
<v Speaker 3>see that you don't have to be owned by</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that craziness.</v>

2935
02:19:12.220 --> 02:19:14.650
<v Speaker 4>You can recognize it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could nip it in its tracks.</v>

2936
02:19:15.400 --> 02:19:17.860
<v Speaker 4>Another thing that I think that people</v>
<v Speaker 4>should take into consideration about</v>

2937
02:19:17.861 --> 02:19:22.840
<v Speaker 4>this talk of this meditation and trying</v>
<v Speaker 4>to manage the mind is that one of the</v>

2938
02:19:22.841 --> 02:19:26.320
<v Speaker 4>big issues and struggles that we faced</v>
<v Speaker 4>with today is addiction to social media.</v>

2939
02:19:26.780 --> 02:19:29.900
<v Speaker 4>It's a giant and it is the exact</v>
<v Speaker 4>opposite of meditation.</v>

2940
02:19:31.010 --> 02:19:36.010
<v Speaker 4>It is this constant like clicking and</v>
<v Speaker 4>being distracted and just getting all</v>

2941
02:19:38.961 --> 02:19:41.510
<v Speaker 4>this weird input from stuff and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>

2942
02:19:41.540 --> 02:19:45.890
<v Speaker 4>I enjoy social media on occasion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you got to recognize that this is</v>

2943
02:19:45.891 --> 02:19:49.610
<v Speaker 4>something that can overwhelm your</v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness</v>

2944
02:19:49.810 --> 02:19:52.700
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not going to present myself as</v>
<v Speaker 3>holier than thou and this because I to</v>

2945
02:19:52.701 --> 02:19:54.620
<v Speaker 3>enjoy it and sometimes I take it too</v>
<v Speaker 3>far.</v>

2946
02:19:54.621 --> 02:19:58.700
<v Speaker 3>There's no question about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll get lost in social media where</v>

2947
02:19:58.701 --> 02:20:02.630
<v Speaker 3>meditation is useful is because again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what your training is self awareness.</v>

2948
02:20:02.750 --> 02:20:06.650
<v Speaker 3>You're just training to see your own</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff clearly so that it doesn't own you</v>

2949
02:20:07.280 --> 02:20:10.490
<v Speaker 3>met in the course of meditation it</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you have some meditation</v>

2950
02:20:10.520 --> 02:20:15.410
<v Speaker 3>under the belt when you're so deep in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter whole that you're,</v>

2951
02:20:15.480 --> 02:20:16.313
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2952
02:20:16.400 --> 02:20:20.330
<v Speaker 3>spent three hours on the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe meditation can kick in at some</v>

2953
02:20:20.331 --> 02:20:20.901
<v Speaker 3>point and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2954
02:20:20.901 --> 02:20:24.170
<v Speaker 3>my stomach is bubbling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my head is aching.</v>

2955
02:20:24.171 --> 02:20:26.450
<v Speaker 3>I haven't eaten.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not ignoring my children.</v>

2956
02:20:26.570 --> 02:20:29.720
<v Speaker 3>And you can pull yourself out of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>spiral and you just get better and</v>

2957
02:20:29.750 --> 02:20:32.660
<v Speaker 3>better at doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think perfection is on offer.</v>

2958
02:20:32.660 --> 02:20:35.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that all of us are gonna</v>
<v Speaker 3>live like Shin Zen young,</v>

2959
02:20:35.421 --> 02:20:38.550
<v Speaker 3>where the university is just bubbling up</v>
<v Speaker 3>through us all the time.</v>

2960
02:20:38.551 --> 02:20:41.510
<v Speaker 3>When we're not enemies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm editing for 50 years.</v>

2961
02:20:41.540 --> 02:20:43.220
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so great.</v>

2962
02:20:43.580 --> 02:20:45.350
<v Speaker 3>That's nice to have those aspirational</v>
<v Speaker 3>figures out there.</v>

2963
02:20:45.351 --> 02:20:47.960
<v Speaker 3>It's also great to have masters out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there who can get in and help us with</v>

2964
02:20:47.961 --> 02:20:51.920
<v Speaker 3>our meditation practice for most of us</v>
<v Speaker 3>at a level of five to 10 minutes a day</v>

2965
02:20:51.921 --> 02:20:54.290
<v Speaker 3>or one minute a day or one minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most days.</v>

2966
02:20:54.620 --> 02:20:57.710
<v Speaker 3>It's just that you're going to become</v>
<v Speaker 3>marginally less of a schmuck and that's</v>

2967
02:20:58.040 --> 02:21:01.490
<v Speaker 3>really valuable and it does not have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be complicated.</v>

2968
02:21:01.730 --> 02:21:04.310
<v Speaker 3>Sit down for five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do it for 10 minutes.</v>

2969
02:21:04.820 --> 02:21:07.460
<v Speaker 3>Notice your breath.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then we get distracted to come back.</v>

2970
02:21:07.640 --> 02:21:09.470
<v Speaker 3>Notice what got you distracted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

2971
02:21:09.710 --> 02:21:11.600
<v Speaker 3>You do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll find your own way into these</v>

2972
02:21:11.601 --> 02:21:12.110
<v Speaker 3>insights.</v>

2973
02:21:12.110 --> 02:21:16.010
<v Speaker 3>You know you will start to learn how it</v>
<v Speaker 3>works and this is take the time to do</v>

2974
02:21:16.011 --> 02:21:17.960
<v Speaker 3>that and you don't even have to do it in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sitting practice.</v>

2975
02:21:17.961 --> 02:21:19.970
<v Speaker 3>You could do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know when you're exercising or</v>

2976
02:21:19.971 --> 02:21:21.410
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just harder to do it when there's</v>

2977
02:21:21.411 --> 02:21:24.590
<v Speaker 3>more going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean normally we lead with that,</v>

2978
02:21:25.310 --> 02:21:28.540
<v Speaker 3>but since you're a beautiful Weirdo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you took us into all sorts of.</v>

2979
02:21:28.550 --> 02:21:32.870
<v Speaker 3>Weird spaces and that's where we went</v>
<v Speaker 3>first and Jeff is in my view,</v>

2980
02:21:32.871 --> 02:21:37.430
<v Speaker 3>one of the best people in the world at</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about meditation at the deep</v>

2981
02:21:37.431 --> 02:21:39.950
<v Speaker 3>end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but normally we lead with what we just</v>

2982
02:21:39.951 --> 02:21:40.890
<v Speaker 3>discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2983
02:21:42.320 --> 02:21:43.153
<v Speaker 3>such is life.</v>

2984
02:21:43.350 --> 02:21:45.930
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that this is an important aspect</v>

2985
02:21:45.931 --> 02:21:50.931
<v Speaker 4>of it to focus on that social media use</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this addiction that we have is</v>

2986
02:21:51.330 --> 02:21:56.330
<v Speaker 4>literally the exact opposite of this</v>
<v Speaker 4>mindfulness and meditation and really</v>

2987
02:21:56.910 --> 02:22:01.380
<v Speaker 4>concentrating on being completely free</v>
<v Speaker 4>of all these,</v>

2988
02:22:01.610 --> 02:22:05.130
<v Speaker 4>these devices and things that you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>distracting yourself.</v>

2989
02:22:05.410 --> 02:22:09.550
<v Speaker 3>Thing to think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like living is making habits.</v>

2990
02:22:10.120 --> 02:22:14.620
<v Speaker 3>What habits are reinforcing you are what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you repeatedly do you.</v>

2991
02:22:14.650 --> 02:22:17.470
<v Speaker 3>So if you are just completely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're training your attention to be</v>

2992
02:22:17.471 --> 02:22:19.900
<v Speaker 3>fragmented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gonna only get more fragmented</v>

2993
02:22:20.110 --> 02:22:22.090
<v Speaker 3>because of the things just keep</v>
<v Speaker 3>changing.</v>

2994
02:22:22.091 --> 02:22:24.550
<v Speaker 3>They get deeper and deeper and deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So at some point you need to start</v>

2995
02:22:24.551 --> 02:22:26.250
<v Speaker 3>training a different set</v>

2996
02:22:26.250 --> 02:22:27.180
<v Speaker 1>of circuits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2997
02:22:27.330 --> 02:22:29.850
<v Speaker 1>it's just about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about what you're going to train</v>

2998
02:22:29.851 --> 02:22:32.820
<v Speaker 1>and what you're not going to train.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of us don't think of life that way.</v>

2999
02:22:33.090 --> 02:22:35.760
<v Speaker 1>We land in life and you just start doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

3000
02:22:35.761 --> 02:22:38.190
<v Speaker 1>but the things you're doing are the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are going to become your</v>

3001
02:22:38.191 --> 02:22:41.220
<v Speaker 1>inevitable conditioning and that's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very sobering thought,</v>

3002
02:22:41.490 --> 02:22:44.580
<v Speaker 1>but it's also liberating thought because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shows you that if you can start to do</v>

3003
02:22:44.850 --> 02:22:47.520
<v Speaker 1>the stuff that's better for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better for your brain,</v>

3004
02:22:47.521 --> 02:22:50.220
<v Speaker 1>your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can start to reverse that stuff</v>

3005
02:22:50.221 --> 02:22:51.054
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3006
02:22:51.110 --> 02:22:52.410
<v Speaker 3>Amen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To what you just hadn't.</v>

3007
02:22:52.440 --> 02:22:57.440
<v Speaker 3>Just to amplify your point about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mindless use of social media being</v>

3008
02:22:58.981 --> 02:23:00.810
<v Speaker 3>the opposite of meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually think there's.</v>

3009
02:23:01.190 --> 02:23:02.910
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the proliferation of</v>

3010
02:23:02.911 --> 02:23:07.911
<v Speaker 3>communication technology is in part why</v>
<v Speaker 3>meditation has become so in vogue</v>

3011
02:23:09.240 --> 02:23:12.370
<v Speaker 3>because people know on some level</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether they can,</v>

3012
02:23:12.960 --> 02:23:16.260
<v Speaker 3>whether they can articulate it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's something's wrong.</v>

3013
02:23:16.500 --> 02:23:19.950
<v Speaker 3>We are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is really interesting woman minutia</v>

3014
02:23:19.980 --> 02:23:23.730
<v Speaker 3>Zomorodi who has a podcast called note</v>
<v Speaker 3>to self and it's about all about our</v>

3015
02:23:23.731 --> 02:23:25.840
<v Speaker 3>relationship with technology and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to her recently.</v>

3016
02:23:25.870 --> 02:23:28.620
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're conducting this massive science</v>

3017
02:23:28.621 --> 02:23:32.930
<v Speaker 3>experiment with these devices and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know what the outcome's going to</v>

3018
02:23:32.931 --> 02:23:36.000
<v Speaker 3>be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's happening globally and people</v>

3019
02:23:36.001 --> 02:23:39.990
<v Speaker 3>have a sense that something's off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that I think is why meditation has</v>

3020
02:23:39.991 --> 02:23:41.190
<v Speaker 3>become such a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

3021
02:23:41.191 --> 02:23:43.950
<v Speaker 3>actually I think what I think is really</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting is if you guys heard of the</v>

3022
02:23:43.960 --> 02:23:46.060
<v Speaker 3>slow technology movement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3023
02:23:46.280 --> 02:23:50.510
<v Speaker 1>there's a few different ideas around</v>
<v Speaker 1>this slow design or the basic idea is</v>

3024
02:23:50.511 --> 02:23:52.730
<v Speaker 1>that right now the interfaces that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>use,</v>

3025
02:23:52.731 --> 02:23:54.500
<v Speaker 1>these flat screens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

3026
02:23:54.720 --> 02:23:56.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the notifications,</v>

3027
02:23:56.901 --> 02:23:58.820
<v Speaker 1>the buzzing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flickers that's kind of blowing our</v>

3028
02:23:58.821 --> 02:24:01.840
<v Speaker 1>attention apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that it's true.</v>

3029
02:24:01.850 --> 02:24:04.250
<v Speaker 1>So it's training the brain and the mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a particular kind of way.</v>

3030
02:24:04.670 --> 02:24:08.240
<v Speaker 1>But in the exact same spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were to start to design these</v>

3031
02:24:08.241 --> 02:24:11.840
<v Speaker 1>interfaces in a way that according to</v>
<v Speaker 1>basic mental health principles,</v>

3032
02:24:12.080 --> 02:24:15.620
<v Speaker 1>you might be able to create a more</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive habits.</v>

3033
02:24:15.800 --> 02:24:19.490
<v Speaker 1>So it's just starting to think like</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually how could we design our to our</v>

3034
02:24:19.491 --> 02:24:22.280
<v Speaker 1>devices?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our interfaces are technology in a way</v>

3035
02:24:22.281 --> 02:24:26.630
<v Speaker 1>that's promoting a more happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more connection,</v>

3036
02:24:26.631 --> 02:24:28.790
<v Speaker 1>more of all the good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a good question.</v>

3037
02:24:28.791 --> 02:24:31.490
<v Speaker 1>People are just starting to ask and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think it's really,</v>

3038
02:24:31.550 --> 02:24:34.580
<v Speaker 1>really cool to like think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about things in that way that</v>

3039
02:24:34.581 --> 02:24:36.170
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be an opportunity,</v>

3040
02:24:36.470 --> 02:24:39.050
<v Speaker 1>there could be an opportunity with these</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the technologies to do something</v>

3041
02:24:39.051 --> 02:24:40.750
<v Speaker 1>really awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like it's,</v>

3042
02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:43.970
<v Speaker 1>it's because they're neutral in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a tool.</v>

3043
02:24:44.090 --> 02:24:45.110
<v Speaker 1>It's how you use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The</v>

3044
02:24:45.110 --> 02:24:48.890
<v Speaker 3>tool and the way in which the tools</v>
<v Speaker 3>designed for allegation is that actually</v>

3045
02:24:48.980 --> 02:24:53.980
<v Speaker 3>many of these devices and platforms have</v>
<v Speaker 3>been designed specifically to me,</v>

3046
02:24:54.810 --> 02:24:58.790
<v Speaker 3>but that's not neutral.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like they're salty potato chips.</v>

3047
02:24:58.820 --> 02:25:00.100
<v Speaker 3>You can't stop eating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3048
02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:04.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm a but I will just put in one plug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But while we're waiting for slow</v>

3049
02:25:04.521 --> 02:25:08.570
<v Speaker 3>technology to come to fruition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are ways that it's on us as users</v>

3050
02:25:08.571 --> 02:25:12.950
<v Speaker 3>to use these things wisely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One thing I would say is as somebody who</v>

3051
02:25:12.951 --> 02:25:17.360
<v Speaker 3>does use twitter and instagram is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a great tweet from this guy,</v>

3052
02:25:17.361 --> 02:25:20.330
<v Speaker 3>Ian Bremmer who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's a big thinker about current</v>

3053
02:25:20.331 --> 02:25:22.370
<v Speaker 3>affairs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His.</v>

3054
02:25:22.371 --> 02:25:25.150
<v Speaker 3>I think his pin tweet is something like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a.</v>

3055
02:25:25.450 --> 02:25:27.640
<v Speaker 3>If you're only following people you</v>
<v Speaker 3>agree with,</v>

3056
02:25:27.700 --> 02:25:31.810
<v Speaker 3>you're doing it wrong and I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a way in which actually are</v>

3057
02:25:31.811 --> 02:25:33.390
<v Speaker 3>social media use in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

3058
02:25:33.440 --> 02:25:38.440
<v Speaker 3>in that we create these cocoons bubbles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideological echo chambers were only</v>

3059
02:25:39.191 --> 02:25:42.610
<v Speaker 3>following people who give us visceral,</v>
<v Speaker 3>satisfying,</v>

3060
02:25:42.670 --> 02:25:43.900
<v Speaker 3>ideological red meat.</v>

3061
02:25:44.290 --> 02:25:49.290
<v Speaker 3>If in fact you can use these platforms</v>
<v Speaker 3>and podcasts to listen to people with</v>

3062
02:25:49.811 --> 02:25:52.090
<v Speaker 3>whom you disagree and maybe you</v>
<v Speaker 3>communicate with them.</v>

3063
02:25:52.330 --> 02:25:56.980
<v Speaker 3>Then actually that is a thoughtful and</v>
<v Speaker 3>wise use of this technology and may</v>

3064
02:25:56.981 --> 02:25:59.470
<v Speaker 3>solve some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I would argue is the biggest</v>

3065
02:25:59.471 --> 02:26:00.970
<v Speaker 3>problem this country is facing right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

3066
02:26:00.971 --> 02:26:03.040
<v Speaker 3>which is toxic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tribalism.</v>

3067
02:26:03.490 --> 02:26:05.830
<v Speaker 3>Toxic tribalism is a really good way of</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting it.</v>

3068
02:26:06.470 --> 02:26:08.440
<v Speaker 3>That's like your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's just stuck in their own</v>

3069
02:26:08.441 --> 02:26:11.230
<v Speaker 3>facebook feeds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's basically the facebook feed is your</v>

3070
02:26:11.231 --> 02:26:12.220
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3071
02:26:12.221 --> 02:26:15.580
<v Speaker 3>but you can use facebook to connect with</v>
<v Speaker 3>your neighbors,</v>

3072
02:26:15.581 --> 02:26:16.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>disagree with you,</v>

3073
02:26:16.481 --> 02:26:21.481
<v Speaker 3>and to actually be able to hear their</v>
<v Speaker 3>arguments in a way that isn't blindly</v>

3074
02:26:23.471 --> 02:26:25.900
<v Speaker 3>reactive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about doing the rounds of the</v>

3075
02:26:25.901 --> 02:26:28.900
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you actually go out there and do the</v>

3076
02:26:28.901 --> 02:26:31.060
<v Speaker 3>rounds of the video and check out some</v>
<v Speaker 3>different perspectives?</v>

3077
02:26:31.190 --> 02:26:32.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

3078
02:26:33.330 --> 02:26:36.480
<v Speaker 2>I think that's very important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do that a lot.</v>

3079
02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:37.110
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3080
02:26:37.110 --> 02:26:38.610
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I follow a lot of people that don't</v>

3081
02:26:38.611 --> 02:26:42.030
<v Speaker 2>agree with and I also try to talk to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of people that don't agree with.</v>

3082
02:26:42.031 --> 02:26:46.560
<v Speaker 2>I think that's also important to and to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have some sort of common ground where</v>

3083
02:26:46.561 --> 02:26:50.880
<v Speaker 2>you can explore the ideas themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 2>not look at the person who presents the</v>

3084
02:26:50.881 --> 02:26:53.640
<v Speaker 2>ideas as your enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a real problem today in this</v>

3085
02:26:53.641 --> 02:26:54.421
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously.</v>

3086
02:26:54.421 --> 02:26:56.700
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've never been more divided in terms</v>

3087
02:26:56.701 --> 02:27:01.701
<v Speaker 2>of right left and the ideologies and</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you have such a divisive</v>

3088
02:27:02.941 --> 02:27:04.440
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have this,</v>

3089
02:27:04.520 --> 02:27:09.520
<v Speaker 2>this person at the very top of the heap</v>
<v Speaker 2>who literally chastises people and mocks</v>

3090
02:27:10.711 --> 02:27:12.390
<v Speaker 2>them on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have a,</v>

3091
02:27:12.391 --> 02:27:16.350
<v Speaker 2>a mocking insulting president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucked up.</v>

3092
02:27:16.450 --> 02:27:20.490
<v Speaker 2>Who uses social media and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>trickle down from that.</v>

3093
02:27:21.210 --> 02:27:24.050
<v Speaker 2>Unquestionably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's people that look to the guy who</v>

3094
02:27:24.060 --> 02:27:27.600
<v Speaker 2>was at the top of the food chain as</v>
<v Speaker 2>being the one who we should model</v>

3095
02:27:27.601 --> 02:27:29.490
<v Speaker 2>ourselves after in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shape or form.</v>

3096
02:27:29.790 --> 02:27:33.450
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea that people are leaning</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that direction now where they weren't</v>

3097
02:27:33.451 --> 02:27:36.240
<v Speaker 2>for eight years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>

3098
02:27:36.300 --> 02:27:40.250
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird time for interaction and</v>
<v Speaker 2>debating ideas.</v>

3099
02:27:40.410 --> 02:27:40.771
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3100
02:27:40.771 --> 02:27:42.280
<v Speaker 3>it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

3101
02:27:42.300 --> 02:27:45.540
<v Speaker 3>one of the negative things with social</v>
<v Speaker 3>media is that thing of just like the</v>

3102
02:27:45.541 --> 02:27:47.580
<v Speaker 3>whole trolling thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could just say whatever you want</v>

3103
02:27:47.581 --> 02:27:49.320
<v Speaker 3>because you don't actually have a real</v>
<v Speaker 3>human being right in front.</v>

3104
02:27:49.340 --> 02:27:51.890
<v Speaker 3>You can't see them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're hurting either hurt.</v>

3105
02:27:52.250 --> 02:27:56.100
<v Speaker 3>So people are just this unbridled</v>
<v Speaker 3>reactivity that just creates more</v>

3106
02:27:56.130 --> 02:28:00.060
<v Speaker 3>activities into my own twitter feed</v>
<v Speaker 3>snowballs and people saying things to me</v>

3107
02:28:00.061 --> 02:28:02.070
<v Speaker 3>that they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I doubt they would ever say to my face,</v>

3108
02:28:02.230 --> 02:28:02.720
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3109
02:28:02.720 --> 02:28:04.370
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what we do.</v>

3110
02:28:04.730 --> 02:28:07.370
<v Speaker 2>That's what people do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the things that's so</v>

3111
02:28:07.371 --> 02:28:12.371
<v Speaker 2>bizarre about the lack of social cues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not standing in front of someone.</v>

3112
02:28:12.411 --> 02:28:14.010
<v Speaker 2>There's no consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3113
02:28:14.060 --> 02:28:19.060
<v Speaker 2>it's communication in incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>unnatural and unrealistic way.</v>

3114
02:28:19.700 --> 02:28:23.320
<v Speaker 2>All our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The time that we were monkeys coming out</v>

3115
02:28:23.321 --> 02:28:27.530
<v Speaker 2>of trees are in exchanges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been face to face until very</v>

3116
02:28:27.531 --> 02:28:28.364
<v Speaker 2>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3117
02:28:28.690 --> 02:28:29.070
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3118
02:28:29.070 --> 02:28:32.040
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know we're flogging the meditation</v>

3119
02:28:32.060 --> 02:28:36.630
<v Speaker 3>thing and I don't want to present it as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a panacea because it's not and nor is it</v>

3120
02:28:36.631 --> 02:28:40.110
<v Speaker 3>the only approach to increasing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sanity quotion in our society,</v>

3121
02:28:40.111 --> 02:28:42.570
<v Speaker 3>which badly needs to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

3122
02:28:42.571 --> 02:28:44.730
<v Speaker 3>I do think that meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mindfulness,</v>

3123
02:28:44.731 --> 02:28:48.360
<v Speaker 3>that sort of self awareness that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>generated through meditation can play a</v>

3124
02:28:48.361 --> 02:28:52.470
<v Speaker 3>positive role in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the aforementioned toxic tribalism</v>

3125
02:28:52.650 --> 02:28:55.920
<v Speaker 3>because if you're so caught up in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>own story,</v>

3126
02:28:56.160 --> 02:28:57.630
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as we've discussed,</v>

3127
02:28:57.631 --> 02:29:01.680
<v Speaker 3>have the kind of empathy that is needed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to understand people who have different</v>

3128
02:29:01.681 --> 02:29:06.681
<v Speaker 3>views and meditation is a way among</v>
<v Speaker 3>other techniques to kind of just reduce</v>

3129
02:29:07.380 --> 02:29:10.590
<v Speaker 3>how seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how personally you're taking your own</v>

3130
02:29:10.620 --> 02:29:13.500
<v Speaker 3>inner chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that can be very useful</v>

3131
02:29:13.501 --> 02:29:16.020
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do I think everybody in the world's are</v>

3132
02:29:16.110 --> 02:29:18.540
<v Speaker 3>automatically gonna hurl themselves into</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Lotus position?</v>

3133
02:29:18.541 --> 02:29:21.510
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think each individual can take a</v>

3134
02:29:21.511 --> 02:29:25.560
<v Speaker 3>personal responsibility for making</v>
<v Speaker 3>things less crazy.</v>

3135
02:29:26.110 --> 02:29:28.630
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a good way to wrap this</v>

3136
02:29:28.631 --> 02:29:29.464
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3137
02:29:29.710 --> 02:29:31.030
<v Speaker 2>Well good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much.</v>

3138
02:29:31.031 --> 02:29:31.980
<v Speaker 2>Thank [inaudible] else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3139
02:29:31.990 --> 02:29:34.720
<v Speaker 2>any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything else to add before we wrap</v>

3140
02:29:34.721 --> 02:29:35.120
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>

3141
02:29:35.120 --> 02:29:37.580
<v Speaker 3>Thank you for putting me in the tank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really appreciate that.</v>

3142
02:29:37.581 --> 02:29:41.240
<v Speaker 3>There's an expression of gratitude is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the expectation of future favors,</v>

3143
02:29:41.660 --> 02:29:42.130
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

3144
02:29:42.130 --> 02:29:45.490
<v Speaker 2>I expect to be back in that tank anytime</v>
<v Speaker 2>you let me know when you're in town.</v>

3145
02:29:45.491 --> 02:29:49.120

<v Speaker 2>there's hundreds of tank centers all</v>

3146
