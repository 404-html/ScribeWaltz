150
00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:49.420
<v Speaker 1>It was talking about how dangerous it is and all this stuff.</v>

151
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:50.230
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

152
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.550
<v Speaker 1>And he had been like,</v>

153
00:03:51.551 --> 00:03:51.791
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

154
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:52.001
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

155
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:52.600
<v Speaker 1>I need it.</v>

156
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm sore all the time.</v>

157
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.963
<v Speaker 1>Check this out.</v>

158
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.450
<v Speaker 1>He gets off of it and because he's off of it,</v>

159
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.020
<v Speaker 1>apparently in talking to people that understand it,</v>

160
00:04:01.021 --> 00:04:01.171
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

161
00:04:01.171 --> 00:04:04.120
<v Speaker 1>it affects your gut bacteria when you take too much of it.</v>

162
00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:04.954
<v Speaker 1>If you abuse it,</v>

163
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.640
<v Speaker 1>he was taking 800 milligrams in the morning,</v>

164
00:04:06.641 --> 00:04:07.630
<v Speaker 1>800 milligrams at night.</v>

165
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.463
<v Speaker 1>It's just too much.</v>

166
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 1>So it was raising,</v>

167
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:12.910
<v Speaker 1>his blood pressure was doing all this shit to him and it was creating</v>

168
00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:15.130
<v Speaker 1>inflammation is gut because he was abusing it.</v>

169
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.840
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking with his joints.</v>

170
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.970
<v Speaker 1>So he gets off of it because of that podcast.</v>

171
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.200
<v Speaker 1>All the pain that he's taking the fucking medication for in the first place goes</v>

172
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:26.890
<v Speaker 1>away because the pain had been partially,</v>

173
00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:28.960
<v Speaker 1>at least because of the fact she's,</v>

174
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:30.850
<v Speaker 1>he's creating inflammation by taking this shit.</v>

175
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.690
<v Speaker 1>So is,</v>

176
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean this guy was running so often,</v>

177
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 1>it didn't make any sense.</v>

178
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand blood pressure.</v>

179
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand what like why do you get high blood pressure?</v>

180
00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:39.011
<v Speaker 1>Why do you not?</v>

181
00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:39.844
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand it,</v>

182
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.310
<v Speaker 1>but I do know that he gets off this Ibuprofen.</v>

183
00:04:42.311 --> 00:04:45.670
<v Speaker 1>He's doing the same thing in every other way and all of a sudden his blood</v>

184
00:04:45.671 --> 00:04:46.504
<v Speaker 1>pressure drops.</v>

185
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

186
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.680
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

187
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.513
<v Speaker 1>That's nuts.</v>

188
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.850
<v Speaker 1>So this guy who is,</v>

189
00:04:51.851 --> 00:04:52.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

190
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.610
<v Speaker 1>doing the commentary for this thing apparently was the funniest fuck that man</v>

191
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.650
<v Speaker 1>says he's the best.</v>

192
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.660
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to one thing that he was saying.</v>

193
00:04:58.661 --> 00:04:59.800
<v Speaker 1>It was hilarious,</v>

194
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:00.634
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.223
<v Speaker 1>They don't trust.</v>

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.211
<v Speaker 1>Maybe something like this,</v>

209
00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:19.421
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

210
00:05:19.421 --> 00:05:19.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

211
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.060
<v Speaker 1>Fatal.</v>

212
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.661
<v Speaker 1>It's five pounds.</v>

213
00:05:20.661 --> 00:05:21.760
<v Speaker 1>I should have asked it in advance.</v>

214
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:22.653
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to bother him.</v>

215
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.860
<v Speaker 1>She's got a lot of planning to do.</v>

216
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.340
<v Speaker 1>How is it that the UFC 200 is still together?</v>

217
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.710
<v Speaker 1>How is it that something catastrophic hasn't happened?</v>

218
00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:30.311
<v Speaker 1>I've cards too.</v>

219
00:05:30.311 --> 00:05:31.000
<v Speaker 1>God damn good.</v>

220
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.840
<v Speaker 1>You just jinxed it.</v>

221
00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.061
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

222
00:05:32.061 --> 00:05:32.241
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

223
00:05:32.241 --> 00:05:32.421
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

224
00:05:32.421 --> 00:05:32.561
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

225
00:05:32.561 --> 00:05:32.741
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

226
00:05:32.741 --> 00:05:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>

227
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.390
<v Speaker 1>If that card goes through though exactly as planned,</v>

228
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.100
<v Speaker 1>it will be left to fall out.</v>

229
00:05:39.101 --> 00:05:39.934
<v Speaker 1>It's still the best,</v>

230
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.960
<v Speaker 1>the best card of all time.</v>

231
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.070
<v Speaker 1>Even if four fallout,</v>

232
00:05:42.071 --> 00:05:42.904
<v Speaker 1>we're still good,</v>

233
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.470
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm thinking is villain.</v>

234
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.460
<v Speaker 1>How weird would it be if nothing fell out like that's how crazy.</v>

235
00:05:48.461 --> 00:05:49.480
<v Speaker 1>This fucking sport is.</v>

236
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.871
<v Speaker 1>Nuts.</v>

237
00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:54.871
<v Speaker 1>This sport is so wild and so volatile that you got to accept the fact we all do.</v>

238
00:05:55.391 --> 00:05:56.950
<v Speaker 1>Like when rumble just pulled out,</v>

239
00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.303
<v Speaker 1>Glover,</v>

240
00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.990
<v Speaker 1>we all accept the fact that man,</v>

241
00:05:59.991 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 1>there's like a certain,</v>

242
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.470
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount of fights that just are not going to happen.</v>

243
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.820
<v Speaker 1>Nothing he could do about it.</v>

244
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.231
<v Speaker 1>Literally nothing.</v>

245
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:06.921
<v Speaker 1>You do nothing.</v>

246
00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:07.820
<v Speaker 1>He was part of the sport,</v>

247
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:08.683
<v Speaker 1>part of the sport.</v>

248
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.000
<v Speaker 1>It's just too crazy.</v>

249
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.701
<v Speaker 1>It's too crazy.</v>

250
00:06:10.701 --> 00:06:11.600
<v Speaker 1>It's too dangerous.</v>

251
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:12.181
<v Speaker 1>Training suit.</v>

296
00:07:32.121 --> 00:07:32.954
<v Speaker 1>Mark Hunt,</v>

297
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:33.980
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Carme,</v>

298
00:07:33.981 --> 00:07:35.210
<v Speaker 1>a Jon Jones.</v>

299
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.860
<v Speaker 1>People are going to have a heart attack.</v>

300
00:07:36.861 --> 00:07:37.694
<v Speaker 1>Dana White.</v>

301
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:39.620
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

302
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:40.880
<v Speaker 1>that's a hard tack card.</v>

303
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:42.560
<v Speaker 1>By the time you get to the main event,</v>

304
00:07:42.561 --> 00:07:43.394
<v Speaker 1>you're dead.</v>

305
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:44.691
<v Speaker 1>You know it's crazy.</v>

306
00:07:44.691 --> 00:07:45.170
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

307
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:46.003
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

308
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say it without Brock Lesnar.</v>

309
00:07:48.381 --> 00:07:48.861
<v Speaker 1>Mark Hunt.</v>

310
00:07:48.861 --> 00:07:52.220
<v Speaker 1>That card's not that big of a bang or paper view wise.</v>

311
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.190
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't beat a con card or Rhonda Card.</v>

312
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.900
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's why they come in.</v>

313
00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:57.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

314
00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.700
<v Speaker 1>That's why they sent that bat signal.</v>

315
00:07:58.701 --> 00:08:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Brock Lesnar came over from WWE.</v>

316
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:00.531
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

317
00:08:00.531 --> 00:08:00.861
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

318
00:08:00.861 --> 00:08:02.060
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason why they pay that money.</v>

319
00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:02.391
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>

320
00:08:02.391 --> 00:08:03.110
<v Speaker 1>They did too.</v>

321
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:04.820
<v Speaker 1>They played a very,</v>

322
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:09.850
<v Speaker 1>very smart move strategically because he's the biggest paper.</v>

323
00:08:11.421 --> 00:08:12.710
<v Speaker 1>If you starve all time,</v>

324
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:14.510
<v Speaker 1>numero uno,</v>

325
00:08:14.511 --> 00:08:15.340
<v Speaker 1>numero uno,</v>

326
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.640
<v Speaker 1>that flat top good for him.</v>

327
00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:21.641
<v Speaker 1>So when Conor McGregor comes along and Conor McGregor in the UFC have some sort</v>

328
00:08:22.281 --> 00:08:24.140
<v Speaker 1>of a disagreement about things,</v>

329
00:08:24.141 --> 00:08:27.860
<v Speaker 1>would it be that is their fucking four aces that they lay down?</v>

330
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

331
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.450
<v Speaker 1>did they pay for it?</v>

332
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:30.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

333
00:08:30.771 --> 00:08:31.910
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely some pain,</v>

334
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:32.170
<v Speaker 1>Yo.</v>

335
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:32.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

336
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:33.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

337
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.063
<v Speaker 1>How much?</v>

338
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:35.330
<v Speaker 1>How much?</v>

339
00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:36.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

340
00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:36.621
<v Speaker 1>Probably a lot.</v>

341
00:08:36.621 --> 00:08:36.920

<v Speaker 1>From what I hear is the most the fighters ever been paid.</v>

344
00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.090
<v Speaker 1>How much do you think that is?</v>

345
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:43.820
<v Speaker 1>Color makes more than 5 million.</v>

346
00:08:43.821 --> 00:08:44.950
<v Speaker 1>Ron Carter made a million.</v>

347
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.700
<v Speaker 1>Apparently Kai was the first MMA athlete to ever enter into Forbes 30,</v>

348
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:50.510
<v Speaker 1>30.</v>

741
00:19:15.221 --> 00:19:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Another one.</v>

742
00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:16.181
<v Speaker 1>Fatal.</v>

743
00:19:16.181 --> 00:19:18.760
<v Speaker 1>Tried to crazy knee fader swings back.</v>

744
00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.560
<v Speaker 1>Look at them and saw Austin.</v>

745
00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:22.930
<v Speaker 1>We're strictly cause he going to go three rounds.</v>

746
00:19:22.931 --> 00:19:24.790
<v Speaker 1>This is incredible and amazing.</v>

747
00:19:24.791 --> 00:19:27.820
<v Speaker 1>The power fade or possesses and has flied in us.</v>

748
00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.800
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen such a powerful flat ass?</v>

749
00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:31.030
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good point.</v>

750
00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:31.480
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

751
00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.550
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just going on as a tiny ass.</v>

752
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.320
<v Speaker 1>Most guys that much power.</v>

753
00:19:35.321 --> 00:19:37.190
<v Speaker 1>I have fucking cheek son because look at how,</v>

754
00:19:37.191 --> 00:19:38.140
<v Speaker 1>why to shoulders are,</v>

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:38.590
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

756
00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:39.860
<v Speaker 1>I know no ass.</v>

757
00:19:39.861 --> 00:19:41.140
<v Speaker 1>That's where all your power comes from.</v>

758
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:45.130
<v Speaker 1>Well you know the thing is you don't need that much power.</v>

759
00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.800
<v Speaker 1>You just need to land with power.</v>

760
00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

761
00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Like the difference between the guy who's got like stupid one punch knockout</v>

762
00:19:53.291 --> 00:19:54.250
<v Speaker 1>path Johnson.</v>

763
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:55.143
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

764
00:19:55.330 --> 00:20:00.330
<v Speaker 1>And it got close to be as though cheeks but Faye doors knocked like um,</v>

765
00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:02.860
<v Speaker 1>what's his face?</v>

766
00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:03.993
<v Speaker 1>The grim reaper.</v>

767
00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.193
<v Speaker 1>Fuck's his name.</v>

768
00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Grim reaper do.</v>

769
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

770
00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:08.170
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

771
00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:09.003
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

772
00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:11.960
<v Speaker 1>give me a hint in strike force</v>

773
00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.250
<v Speaker 1>talking about Brett Rogers Rodgers,</v>

774
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.390
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

775
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:16.911
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

776
00:20:16.911 --> 00:20:18.100
<v Speaker 1>He didn't call himself the grim reaper.</v>

777
00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:18.993
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

778
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:19.570
<v Speaker 1>Did he,</v>

779
00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:21.610
<v Speaker 1>did he breadth the grim reaper Rogers.</v>

780
00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:21.881
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

781
00:20:21.881 --> 00:20:23.590
<v Speaker 1>that's a nice ring to make that up.</v>

782
00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:23.771
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

783
00:20:23.771 --> 00:20:24.660
<v Speaker 1>that has a nice ring.</v>

784
00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:27.040
<v Speaker 1>Somebody call him that he did it and I hope it comes back and fights.</v>

785
00:20:27.041 --> 00:20:27.360
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

786
00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.193
<v Speaker 1>has that name?</v>

787
00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:28.800
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

788
00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:29.633
<v Speaker 1>I made it up.</v>

789
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:30.663
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

790
00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:31.740
<v Speaker 1>The grim.</v>

791
00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:32.573
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

792
00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:34.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry Doug Graham.</v>

793
00:20:34.421 --> 00:20:35.011
<v Speaker 1>But he thought,</v>

794
00:20:35.011 --> 00:20:35.450
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

795
00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:36.720
<v Speaker 1>look at this phase.</v>

796
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Brandon,</v>

797
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:38.560
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

798
00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:43.090
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just the shorts for Bikini's on you would see a little bubble.</v>

799
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:46.900
<v Speaker 1>But remember Brett Rodgers knocked out Andrea Lawsky and the first round and he</v>

800
00:20:46.901 --> 00:20:50.620
<v Speaker 1>was really good and I think he fought fade or after that if I'm correct.</v>

801
00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:51.100
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

802
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:52.180
<v Speaker 1>He thought he'd beat Andre.</v>

803
00:20:52.181 --> 00:20:54.940
<v Speaker 1>And then it was a big high profile fight,</v>

804
00:20:54.941 --> 00:20:58.900
<v Speaker 1>but it was a tough fight for Fado before he bombed on him with a right hand.</v>

805
00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:01.660
<v Speaker 1>And there was an interesting fight because one of his trainers just like fate or</v>

806
00:21:01.661 --> 00:21:03.040
<v Speaker 1>one with his old tricks,</v>

807
00:21:03.041 --> 00:21:05.790
<v Speaker 1>but really like you need to be training and there,</v>

808
00:21:05.791 --> 00:21:08.080
<v Speaker 1>remember Brett Rogers Fret over him.</v>

809
00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:09.753
<v Speaker 1>He fought Uber.</v>

810
00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Uber even fucking thrown to the mat.</v>

811
00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.830
<v Speaker 1>Ubering was terrifying back then and said,</v>

812
00:21:14.831 --> 00:21:14.951
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

813
00:21:14.951 --> 00:21:15.581
<v Speaker 1>Brett Rogers,</v>

814
00:21:15.581 --> 00:21:18.300
<v Speaker 1>sweet knock out of our Lawsky here's feed or Uber,</v>

815
00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:18.330

<v Speaker 1>Enjoy this.</v>

817
00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:20.430
<v Speaker 1>You're going to go away now.</v>

818
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.770
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

819
00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:22.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't enjoy an MMA.</v>

820
00:21:22.151 --> 00:21:23.500
<v Speaker 1>That overhead shot.</v>

821
00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:24.641
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

822
00:21:24.641 --> 00:21:25.600
<v Speaker 1>the right hands.</v>

823
00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:26.983
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

824
00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:30.080
<v Speaker 1>Maldon Nanos got a nice short right hand.</v>

825
00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:33.170
<v Speaker 1>Who can that Jab fitters thinking right now?</v>

826
00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.280

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:35.953
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

828
00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:41.780
<v Speaker 1>Maldonado way looked at like double jab fate to the face and a jab to the body.</v>

829
00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.250
<v Speaker 1>Nice and loose.</v>

830

00:22:59.090 --> 00:22:59.900
<v Speaker 1>He's exhausted.</v>

885
00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:00.650
<v Speaker 1>He is.</v>

886
00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:02.120
<v Speaker 1>But I mean fader was really good at,</v>

887
00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:03.470
<v Speaker 1>look at his adjustment.</v>

888
00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:04.810
<v Speaker 1>He's decided to fight on the outside,</v>

889
00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:05.780
<v Speaker 1>start kicking now.</v>

890
00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:08.170
<v Speaker 1>And then these found the weakness in Maldonado,</v>

891
00:23:08.171 --> 00:23:09.004
<v Speaker 1>his range,</v>

892
00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:11.090
<v Speaker 1>he's fighting way farther apart now.</v>

893
00:23:11.091 --> 00:23:14.060
<v Speaker 1>Look at him cause he got ate up by some of those punches and so you got such a</v>

894
00:23:14.061 --> 00:23:14.600
<v Speaker 1>good job.</v>

895
00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.433
<v Speaker 1>Oh beautiful.</v>

896
00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:16.760
<v Speaker 1>So was coming in with these punches,</v>

897
00:23:16.761 --> 00:23:18.200
<v Speaker 1>but he's on the outside with those kicks.</v>

898
00:23:18.201 --> 00:23:21.410
<v Speaker 1>See I think this distance he changed the whole distance game.</v>

899
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:25.270
<v Speaker 1>I think anyone in the top 10 would eat his fight.</v>

900
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:26.561
<v Speaker 1>Maybe now.</v>

901
00:23:26.561 --> 00:23:27.480
<v Speaker 1>But God damn it,</v>

902
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:28.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching.</v>

903
00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:29.680
<v Speaker 1>This shit almost makes me upset.</v>

904
00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:30.581
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

905
00:23:30.581 --> 00:23:31.750
<v Speaker 1>I lied or man,</v>

906
00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:32.111
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

907
00:23:32.111 --> 00:23:36.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that pride in the UFC didn't come to some sort of an agreement</v>

908
00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:37.931
<v Speaker 1>early,</v>

909
00:23:37.931 --> 00:23:38.471
<v Speaker 1>early,</v>

910
00:23:38.471 --> 00:23:43.471
<v Speaker 1>early on and we could've seen fade or like cro cop fade or add his best fight</v>

911
00:23:44.801 --> 00:23:47.900
<v Speaker 1>against the best heavyweights and he mean very well.</v>

912
00:23:47.901 --> 00:23:51.560
<v Speaker 1>May have been the best for quite a few years.</v>

913
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.270
<v Speaker 1>Most likely was most likely,</v>

914
00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:54.283
<v Speaker 1>most likely.</v>

915
00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:55.191
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

916
00:23:55.191 --> 00:23:55.641
<v Speaker 1>it's all,</v>

917
00:23:55.641 --> 00:23:58.670
<v Speaker 1>it's all speculative and totally actually fights a guy like Cain.</v>

918
00:23:59.060 --> 00:23:59.751
<v Speaker 1>But God damn,</v>

919
00:23:59.751 --> 00:24:00.500
<v Speaker 1>he was good.</v>

920
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Maldonado was a brown belt boom.</v>

921
00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful fucking combination for memory.</v>

922
00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.073
<v Speaker 1>Harmful.</v>

923
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:08.790
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

924
00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:09.610
<v Speaker 1>look that right.</v>

925
00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:10.640
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

926
00:24:10.641 --> 00:24:11.280
<v Speaker 1>He looks good.</v>

927
00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:13.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about those really guys</v>

928
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:15.500
<v Speaker 1>blue,</v>

929
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:16.510
<v Speaker 1>but the k doors,</v>

930
00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:16.990
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

931
00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:18.890
<v Speaker 1>he's landing some colorful show shit.</v>

932
00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:19.191
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

933
00:24:19.191 --> 00:24:19.360
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

934
00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:23.210
<v Speaker 1>you sympathize with him because he beat bay doors ass and he got tired from it.</v>

935
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.033
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

936
00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:26.900
<v Speaker 1>They don't got the ass kicking.</v>

937
00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:27.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

938
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:28.230
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

939
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:28.420
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

940
00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.380
<v Speaker 1>He's one on the other side of the punishment.</v>

941
00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.030
<v Speaker 1>I got feed or um,</v>

942
00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's hitting on some really good shots towards the end of this round.</v>

943
00:24:34.791 --> 00:24:35.840
<v Speaker 1>I think it's his round.</v>

944
00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:39.680
<v Speaker 1>100% of them are small punch this round.</v>

945
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:39.840
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

946
00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:40.060
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

947
00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:40.970
<v Speaker 1>he did in the beginning.</v>

948
00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:42.200
<v Speaker 1>Very beginning.</v>

949
00:24:42.201 --> 00:24:43.160
<v Speaker 1>He hit him with good shots,</v>

950
00:24:43.161 --> 00:24:47.300
<v Speaker 1>but Fado has definitely taken over this round or set 100% of first round.</v>

951
00:24:47.301 --> 00:24:48.190
<v Speaker 1>He lost 10,</v>

952
00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:48.800
<v Speaker 1>eight.</v>

953
00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck you from Russia.</v>

954
00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Egypt.</v>

955
00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:52.120
<v Speaker 1>That's 10 me.</v>

956
00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:52.881
<v Speaker 1>It might be 10,</v>

957
00:24:52.881 --> 00:24:53.570
<v Speaker 1>seven man.</v>

958
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:55.970
<v Speaker 1>It might be 10 cigs if we're in fucking Colorado.</v>

959
00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:56.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

960
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:57.080
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>

961
00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:57.501
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

962
00:24:57.501 --> 00:24:59.560
<v Speaker 1>Decide what that is because that was the Brits attentive.</v>

963
00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.240
<v Speaker 1>That was a vicious beat down in this round is a perfect example.</v>

964
00:25:02.241 --> 00:25:04.730
<v Speaker 1>This is not the beat down that that first round was,</v>

965
00:25:04.731 --> 00:25:06.950
<v Speaker 1>it's he's who could this Maldonaldo clipped him.</v>

966
00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:08.900
<v Speaker 1>Draw modern.</v>

967
00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't fucking clipped him again.</v>

968
00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:11.480
<v Speaker 1>I look at Fader,</v>

969
00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:11.931
<v Speaker 1>his face,</v>

970
00:25:11.931 --> 00:25:12.171
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

971
00:25:12.171 --> 00:25:13.220
<v Speaker 1>It's a horror mask.</v>

972
00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:13.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

973
00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:14.603
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

974
00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

975
00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:17.953
<v Speaker 1>God Damn.</v>

976
00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.180
<v Speaker 1>The faders brothers in prison.</v>

977
00:25:20.181 --> 00:25:21.014
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

978
00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:22.623
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

979
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.140
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what I read last time.</v>

980
00:25:24.141 --> 00:25:24.730
<v Speaker 1>I too.</v>

981
00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:26.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like Marlo Zimmer main new sites.</v>

982
00:25:26.661 --> 00:25:28.590
<v Speaker 1>How to think about it and then interviewed them there.</v>

983
00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:29.600
<v Speaker 1>Kill them bitches or something.</v>

984
00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:31.820
<v Speaker 1>He killed anybody in the snow.</v>

985
00:25:31.821 --> 00:25:32.960
<v Speaker 1>I think you're making sure that,</v>

986
00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck happened.</v>

987
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:37.130
<v Speaker 1>Even little snow,</v>

988
00:25:37.131 --> 00:25:38.240
<v Speaker 1>but he's a savage.</v>

989
00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:41.030
<v Speaker 1>He's a super selfish blue.</v>

990
00:25:41.031 --> 00:25:41.864
<v Speaker 1>That ACL.</v>

991
00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:46.070
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the commentary was at its best.</v>

992
00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what is going on.</v>

993
00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:49.853
<v Speaker 1>What</v>

994
00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:52.551
<v Speaker 1>he fell down,</v>

995
00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:52.910
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

996
00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:55.850
<v Speaker 1>She's showcase trying to create drama when there is nothing ice.</v>

997
00:25:55.851 --> 00:25:56.570
<v Speaker 1>He's fat.</v>

998
00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:59.180
<v Speaker 1>Fucking five minutes and 50 seconds.</v>

999
00:25:59.181 --> 00:26:00.300
<v Speaker 1>How about you shut that off.</v>

1000
00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.113
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1001
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:03.583
<v Speaker 2>Yeah</v>

1002
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:05.543
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1003
00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Well fight.</v>

1004
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:08.450
<v Speaker 1>So fader won that round,</v>

1005
00:26:08.451 --> 00:26:09.470
<v Speaker 1>but that's a ten nine rounds.</v>

1006
00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:13.280
<v Speaker 1>The last round was ten eight hundred percent I agree 100% even though he got</v>

1007
00:26:13.281 --> 00:26:13.730
<v Speaker 1>knocked down.</v>

1008
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:14.563
<v Speaker 1>He still one?</v>

1009
00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:15.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1010
00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:15.591
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1011
00:26:15.591 --> 00:26:16.330
<v Speaker 1>I think you want,</v>

1012
00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:17.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>

1013
00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:19.490
<v Speaker 1>he got clipped any went down,</v>

1014
00:26:19.491 --> 00:26:22.180
<v Speaker 1>but he went right back up and I think mother Russia,</v>

1015
00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:24.320
<v Speaker 1>he landed some pretty significant shots.</v>

1016
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:25.370
<v Speaker 1>It was a close round,</v>

1017
00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:26.960
<v Speaker 1>but I think I gave it to fade or,</v>

1018
00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:30.260
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not a judge and I really don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.</v>

1019
00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:32.240
<v Speaker 1>Did anything terrible at scoring things.</v>

1020
00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:34.220
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1021
00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Tufts sports score,</v>

1022
00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't think in some cases there should be a winner.</v>

1023
00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:38.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1024
00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.820
<v Speaker 1>like the boss of your fight both say,</v>

1025
00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:41.450
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1026
00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:41.860
<v Speaker 1>I feel good.</v>

1027
00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:43.070
<v Speaker 1>That's like that.</v>

1028
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Like to say one guy,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Steep Steep Bay has the potential for sure.</v>

1079
00:27:43.861 --> 00:27:44.910
<v Speaker 1>He's like at the door,</v>

1089
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:52.913

<v Speaker 1>Combo.</v>

1106
00:28:22.281 --> 00:28:25.340
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful Combo by fate or really isn't dropped.</v>

1107
00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:26.480

<v Speaker 1>Mom and clipped him again with the left.</v>

1109
00:28:28.551 --> 00:28:30.050
<v Speaker 1>Hook them up.</v>

1110
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:32.150
<v Speaker 1>That left hook on the outside.</v>

1111
00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:32.691
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1115
00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:43.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1116
00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:43.960
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1117
00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.150
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things where you gotta wonder like,</v>

1118
00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:47.800
<v Speaker 1>is this what fate or wants to do?</v>

1119
00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:51.910
<v Speaker 1>Is this like an exciting fight for Ramsey and join this or is this a,</v>

1120
00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:54.190
<v Speaker 1>is it a financial decision?</v>

1121
00:28:54.191 --> 00:28:56.110
<v Speaker 1>You feel like it's diminishing his legacy?</v>

1122
00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:56.950
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1123
00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:57.783
<v Speaker 1>not to me.</v>

1124
00:28:57.970 --> 00:28:59.440
<v Speaker 1>To me it's just this is who he is.</v>

1125
00:28:59.441 --> 00:29:00.550
<v Speaker 1>This is not what he's done.</v>

1126
00:29:00.551 --> 00:29:01.384
<v Speaker 1>Just a fighter.</v>

1127
00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:03.010
<v Speaker 1>What he's done is just fucking,</v>

1128
00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:04.630
<v Speaker 1>you can't take that away from them.</v>

1129
00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:05.763
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1130
00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you go always be PAMF pound one or two for me.</v>

1131
00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Heavyweight.</v>

1132
00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:09.911
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1133
00:29:09.911 --> 00:29:10.660
<v Speaker 1>I think one,</v>

1134
00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:11.493
<v Speaker 1>I think one,</v>

1135
00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:12.170
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1136
00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:13.150
<v Speaker 1>For me as a case.</v>

1137
00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:14.320
<v Speaker 1>He does have a case,</v>

1138
00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:15.640
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is,</v>

1139
00:29:15.641 --> 00:29:16.181
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1140
00:29:16.181 --> 00:29:19.390
<v Speaker 1>a fader was the same guy by the time he got divert doom.</v>

1141
00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:21.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's total speculation.</v>

1142
00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:22.353
<v Speaker 1>I also think,</v>

1143
00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:22.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1144
00:29:22.991 --> 00:29:24.160
<v Speaker 1>guys taught long and errors,</v>

1145
00:29:24.161 --> 00:29:24.440
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1146
00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:24.851
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1147
00:29:24.851 --> 00:29:26.590
<v Speaker 1>Because you look at what Kane did,</v>

1148
00:29:26.591 --> 00:29:27.290
<v Speaker 1>amber doom,</v>

1149
00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:30.700
<v Speaker 1>they're also facing I think more well rounded guys.</v>

1150
00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1151
00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:32.170
<v Speaker 1>Good shot to the bottom.</v>

1152
00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:33.580
<v Speaker 1>Evolution of the sport.</v>

1153
00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:34.473
<v Speaker 1>100%.</v>

1154
00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:35.410
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1155
00:29:35.411 --> 00:29:36.790
<v Speaker 1>when you're looking at all time greats,</v>

1156
00:29:36.791 --> 00:29:39.130
<v Speaker 1>don't you think that Muhammad Ali is the greatest boxer of all time?</v>

1165
00:29:45.851 --> 00:29:46.111
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>

1166
00:29:46.111 --> 00:29:48.160
<v Speaker 1>What do you think that he would have survived?</v>

1167
00:29:48.161 --> 00:29:48.821
<v Speaker 1>Mike Tyson,</v>

1168
00:29:48.821 --> 00:29:49.451

<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

1172
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:52.090
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

1173
00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:54.100
<v Speaker 1>but did you ever watch Henry Cooper knock them down?</v>

1174

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1175
00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:57.040
<v Speaker 1>they're like the same age when Henry Cooper knocked,</v>

1176
00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:57.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1177
00:29:57.610 --> 00:29:58.421
<v Speaker 1>Tyson down,</v>

1178
00:29:58.421 --> 00:29:58.930
<v Speaker 1>or excuse me,</v>

1179
00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:00.790
<v Speaker 1>Muhammad Ali down and um,</v>

1180
00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:02.493
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1181
00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:03.371
<v Speaker 1>we're talking,</v>

1182
00:30:03.371 --> 00:30:05.890
<v Speaker 1>we're talking Muhammad Ali before the draft bullshit.</v>

1183
00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:06.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1184
00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:07.121
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1185
00:30:07.121 --> 00:30:07.701
<v Speaker 1>This is death.</v>

1186
00:30:07.701 --> 00:30:08.980
<v Speaker 1>This was when he was Cassius clay.</v>

1187
00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:10.630
<v Speaker 1>When he sketched clay,</v>

1188
00:30:10.631 --> 00:30:13.120
<v Speaker 1>he beats Mike Tyson afterwards where it's tough.</v>

1189
00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:14.653
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1190
00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:16.090
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to say man.</v>

1191
00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1192
00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:18.341
<v Speaker 1>That's a thing,</v>

1193
00:30:18.341 --> 00:30:18.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1194
00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:20.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like when do you catch the guy?</v>

1195
00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:24.640
<v Speaker 1>Like when you look at this fade or you can't judge this fade or in the third</v>

1196
00:30:24.641 --> 00:30:27.850
<v Speaker 1>round of this fight with Fabio Maldonado who's been beaten up,</v>

1197
00:30:27.851 --> 00:30:28.900
<v Speaker 1>his eyes are almost won.</v>

1198
00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:34.210
<v Speaker 1>This is not quite the same guy as the guy who we saw just armbar.</v>

1199
00:30:35.741 --> 00:30:37.810
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Randleman have to get super relaxed.</v>

1200
00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:43.020
<v Speaker 1>The guy that we saw come back against Fujita Fujita caught him on the big punch,</v>

1201
00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:43.741
<v Speaker 1>came back.</v>

1202
00:30:43.741 --> 00:30:45.220
<v Speaker 1>There was no Garrett grounding pal.</v>

1203
00:30:45.221 --> 00:30:45.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

1204
00:30:45.881 --> 00:30:46.710
<v Speaker 1>It was no camera.</v>

1205
00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:47.600
<v Speaker 1>That's what the time,</v>

1206
00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:52.780
<v Speaker 1>cause remember Verdomme fought in pride and he would have eight fucking ver</v>

1207
00:30:52.781 --> 00:30:56.970
<v Speaker 1>dooms lunch back then but for doom now with list his fucking head off.</v>

1208
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.510
<v Speaker 1>I think there are different guidance to say for doom now is on the,</v>

1209
00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:03.970
<v Speaker 1>he's still at the very highest level.</v>

1210
00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:07.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean we've got to see how he rebalanced for Steve Bay knock out cause it was a</v>

1211
00:31:07.421 --> 00:31:08.290
<v Speaker 1>brutal knockout.</v>

1212
00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:09.730
<v Speaker 1>But before that fight,</v>

1213
00:31:09.731 --> 00:31:12.790
<v Speaker 1>if you look at his knock out and Mark Hunt and if you look at a submission</v>

1214
00:31:12.791 --> 00:31:13.840
<v Speaker 1>victory over a cane,</v>

1215
00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:15.820
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at like the best version.</v>

1216
00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:20.850
<v Speaker 1>You think about junior dos Santos in his prime against fade or fight junior dos</v>

1217
00:31:21.371 --> 00:31:23.440
<v Speaker 1>Santos is prime in his prime.</v>

1218
00:31:23.441 --> 00:31:24.880
<v Speaker 1>His father came stuff.</v>

1219
00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:25.990
<v Speaker 1>But I'll tell you what dude,</v>

1220
00:31:25.991 --> 00:31:28.810
<v Speaker 1>he looked really fucking good and his last one great.</v>

1221
00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:30.190
<v Speaker 1>He did look really good.</v>

1222
00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:30.850
<v Speaker 1>You look great.</v>

1223
00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:31.391
<v Speaker 1>Shocking,</v>

1224
00:31:31.391 --> 00:31:31.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1225
00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:32.410
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

1226
00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:33.200
<v Speaker 1>Really good.</v>

1227
00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.033
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

1228
00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:40.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean a lot of people thought that Ben Rothwell had the answer to his uh,</v>

1229
00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:42.070
<v Speaker 1>boxing style with his,</v>

1230
00:31:42.071 --> 00:31:42.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1231
00:31:42.281 --> 00:31:43.600
<v Speaker 1>Ben is just awkwardness.</v>

1232
00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:45.010
<v Speaker 1>Real awkward and dangerous.</v>

1233
00:31:45.011 --> 00:31:48.880
<v Speaker 1>Like super dangerous was knockout power dealt with and also like really</v>

1234
00:31:48.881 --> 00:31:49.480
<v Speaker 1>confident.</v>

1235
00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:49.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1236
00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:53.550
<v Speaker 1>Ben is just a real savage and super experienced guys.</v>

1237
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:54.640
<v Speaker 1>Been around for a long time.</v>

1238
00:31:54.641 --> 00:31:55.210
<v Speaker 1>Huge,</v>

1239
00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:55.721

00:31:55.721 --> 00:31:56.261
<v Speaker 1>enormous,</v>

1242

1243
00:32:00.251 --> 00:32:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Like just how busy we are,</v>

1244
00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:01.991
<v Speaker 1>how big he was.</v>

1245
00:32:01.991 --> 00:32:03.100
<v Speaker 1>And even at Wayne's I was like,</v>

1246
00:32:03.101 --> 00:32:03.911
<v Speaker 1>he's not that big.</v>

1247
00:32:03.911 --> 00:32:06.010
<v Speaker 1>They want to get knocked down like Jesus Christ.</v>

1248
00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:08.470
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck am I doing it heavyweight.</v>

1249
00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:09.730

1250
00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:10.260
<v Speaker 1>Enormous.</v>

1251
00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:11.200
<v Speaker 1>And Harry,</v>

1252
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:12.620
<v Speaker 1>he's so big that he did.</v>

1253
00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:13.270
<v Speaker 1>He like,</v>

1254
00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:17.730
<v Speaker 1>there's no doubt he could not make two oh five you look at me go wide.</v>

1255
00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:20.740
<v Speaker 1>These are real heavyweight fights.</v>

1256
00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:22.180
<v Speaker 1>I like to be lost a row or like,</v>

1257
00:32:22.181 --> 00:32:22.301
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1258
00:32:22.301 --> 00:32:23.200
<v Speaker 1>what do you think your two of five?</v>

1259
00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:24.063
<v Speaker 1>No Man,</v>

1260
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:25.510
<v Speaker 1>what do you think of 300 yeah,</v>

1261
00:32:25.511 --> 00:32:26.980
<v Speaker 1>he's the argument for the weight class.</v>

1262
00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:27.461
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1263
00:32:27.461 --> 00:32:28.650
<v Speaker 1>it's got his hands down.</v>

1264
00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:30.560
<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>

1265
00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:31.240
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

1266
00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:31.991
<v Speaker 1>He's exhausted.</v>

1267
00:32:31.991 --> 00:32:32.824
<v Speaker 1>I think man.</v>

1268
00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.770
<v Speaker 1>But he a lot of times he fought like that.</v>

1269
00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:37.810
<v Speaker 1>He never moved like that,</v>

1270
00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:39.640
<v Speaker 1>but he's just a,</v>

1271
00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1272
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean you got to consider the beating that he took in that first round,</v>

1273
00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:45.860
<v Speaker 1>but if you remember like the cro cop that used to,</v>

1274
00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:46.611
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>

1275
00:32:46.611 --> 00:32:47.444
<v Speaker 1>That's the end.</v>

1276
00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:48.110
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1277
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1278
00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:51.880
<v Speaker 1>I first round ten nine six [inaudible] 10 I mean first round,</v>

1279
00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:53.930
<v Speaker 1>ten eight second around ten nine this friend,</v>

1280
00:32:53.931 --> 00:32:54.561
<v Speaker 1>I don't fuck,</v>

1281
00:32:54.561 --> 00:32:58.130
<v Speaker 1>he won this round two seems like a draw.</v>

1282
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.580
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

1283
00:32:58.580 --> 00:32:59.660
<v Speaker 1>I would assume that it's draw.</v>

1284
00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:00.610
<v Speaker 1>If I was a,</v>

1285
00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:02.480
<v Speaker 1>if I didn't know the score,</v>

1286
00:33:02.481 --> 00:33:04.460
<v Speaker 1>he jumped up on the ring like he for sure had it.</v>

1287
00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:04.971
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1288
00:33:04.971 --> 00:33:05.960
<v Speaker 1>you know he fought well.</v>

1289
00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:08.780
<v Speaker 1>I know in that first round he did second 30 days.</v>

1290
00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Hill faded would be undecided in a couple of shots in there.</v>

1291
00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:18.140
<v Speaker 1>We'll fade or definitely came back in that second and his reign draw his range</v>

1292
00:33:18.141 --> 00:33:18.590
<v Speaker 1>was better.</v>

1293
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:18.831
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1294
00:33:18.831 --> 00:33:21.260
<v Speaker 1>I would say that that's a reasonable to call that a draw.</v>

1295
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:23.210
<v Speaker 1>If I was watching this and I was objective,</v>

1296
00:33:23.211 --> 00:33:25.290
<v Speaker 1>there's never good Madoff in the house either.</v>

1297
00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:28.160
<v Speaker 1>Draw them all Dinaro line either at the draw.</v>

1298
00:33:28.161 --> 00:33:28.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm all denial.</v>

1299
00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:29.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1300
00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:29.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't see,</v>

1301
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:30.423
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1302
00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:31.371
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1303
00:33:31.371 --> 00:33:32.180
<v Speaker 1>And the damage,</v>

1304
00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:37.180
<v Speaker 1>well there's no way that fate or the second or the third by any more than ten</v>

1305
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:38.780
<v Speaker 1>nine if you had the standard scoring system,</v>

1306
00:33:38.781 --> 00:33:39.410
<v Speaker 1>we're getting dropped.</v>

1307
00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:41.170
<v Speaker 1>Last hook he grabbed,</v>

1308
00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:42.470
<v Speaker 1>he cracked him,</v>

1309
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:43.070
<v Speaker 1>he cracked.</v>

1310
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:44.060
<v Speaker 1>Even in these rounds,</v>

1311
00:33:44.061 --> 00:33:44.960
<v Speaker 1>he's still hurt,</v>

1312
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:49.990
<v Speaker 1>fade or more than feed or hurt him or hit him or fate or it hit him with some</v>

1313
00:33:50.061 --> 00:33:50.521
<v Speaker 1>good shots.</v>

1314
00:33:50.521 --> 00:33:51.380
<v Speaker 1>Those second and third rounds,</v>

1315
00:33:51.381 --> 00:33:52.101
<v Speaker 1>but he wobbled,</v>

1316
00:33:52.101 --> 00:33:55.580

1385
00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:24.051

00:35:24.051 --> 00:35:26.960
<v Speaker 1>we all know he's drawn this shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

00:35:29.631 --> 00:35:30.201
<v Speaker 1>Listen man,</v>

1392
00:35:30.201 --> 00:35:34.730
<v Speaker 1>we all miss something in our world by Brock Lesnar and fade or never fighting.</v>

1393
00:35:34.731 --> 00:35:35.180
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1394
00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:36.800
<v Speaker 1>We all miss something 100%.</v>

1395
00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:38.400
<v Speaker 1>We miss a little piece of life.</v>

1396
00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.090
<v Speaker 1>Two Lane that could have been too late.</v>

1397
00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:43.590
<v Speaker 1>That could have been really interesting.</v>

1398
00:35:43.591 --> 00:35:44.430
<v Speaker 1>It's still happen.</v>

1399
00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:46.320
<v Speaker 1>It could definitely still happen.</v>

1400
00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Immediate fate or just won this fight.</v>

1401
00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:50.610
<v Speaker 1>And if Brock wins his fight,</v>

1402
00:35:50.611 --> 00:35:51.810
<v Speaker 1>which is certainly a bigF ,</v>

1403
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:56.520
<v Speaker 1>and if the UFC decides to sign fade or after this fight,</v>

1404
00:35:56.521 --> 00:35:57.660
<v Speaker 1>because to the fans,</v>

1520
00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:03.520
<v Speaker 1>What was I asking you?</v>

1521
00:39:03.521 --> 00:39:06.620
<v Speaker 1>This research I caught value of,</v>

1522
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:11.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know whether or not fade or is rumored to be fighting value of next</v>

1523
00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:16.450
<v Speaker 1>because someone was saying that on Twitter.</v>

1524
00:39:16.451 --> 00:39:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Can you believe he's going to fight value of,</v>

1525
00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:18.431
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

1526
00:39:18.431 --> 00:39:19.264
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

1527
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:20.230
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Twitter.</v>

1528
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:22.630
<v Speaker 1>Read it somewhere where I read it.</v>

1529
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:23.860
<v Speaker 1>He just needs to stop.</v>

1530
00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:27.880
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe it doesn't need to stop or does he need to do whatever the fuck he</v>

1531
00:39:27.881 --> 00:39:30.820
<v Speaker 1>wants to do and this is loves doing the fuck he wants to do.</v>

1532
00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:33.760
<v Speaker 1>This is probably like more fun for him.</v>

1533
00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:34.571
<v Speaker 1>That did not look,</v>

1534
00:39:34.571 --> 00:39:35.860
<v Speaker 1>they're not telling you,</v>

1535
00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:40.160
<v Speaker 1>but came back strong as fuck in that second round.</v>

1536
00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:41.350
<v Speaker 1>This is the first real,</v>

1537
00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:43.660
<v Speaker 1>it was the first real challenge that he's had.</v>

1538
00:39:43.661 --> 00:39:45.460
<v Speaker 1>The first guy just could not grapple with them.</v>

1539
00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:46.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1540
00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:46.931
<v Speaker 1>Take that guy down.</v>

1541
00:39:46.931 --> 00:39:49.090
<v Speaker 1>Dominates and when the ground ground and pounds on this fight,</v>

1542
00:39:49.091 --> 00:39:49.924
<v Speaker 1>he gets tested.</v>

1543
00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.330
<v Speaker 1>So what he's got to do now for shampoos,</v>

1544
00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.700
<v Speaker 1>take some fucking time off.</v>

1545
00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Take a long time.</v>

1546
00:39:56.051 --> 00:39:56.460
<v Speaker 1>Off.</v>

1547
00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:57.790
<v Speaker 1>I think we've taken enough time off.</v>

1548
00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:59.920
<v Speaker 1>You've got to heal up and get your ass back.</v>

1549
00:39:59.921 --> 00:40:00.790
<v Speaker 1>You don't get that much time.</v>

1550
00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:01.271
<v Speaker 1>But that's not what,</v>

1551
00:40:01.271 --> 00:40:04.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm 39 I agree with you 100% but I think he's got to take some time off from</v>

1552
00:40:04.631 --> 00:40:05.410
<v Speaker 1>that beating.</v>

1553
00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:06.370
<v Speaker 1>He took a beating dude.</v>

1554
00:40:06.371 --> 00:40:07.630
<v Speaker 1>You can't just jump right back in.</v>

1555
00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:08.381
<v Speaker 1>You'll be,</v>

1556
00:40:08.381 --> 00:40:09.760
<v Speaker 1>you'll still be suffering.</v>

1557
00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:10.613
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

1558
00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:12.650
<v Speaker 1>remember what Steve Bay did?</v>

1559

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:16.803
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

1562
00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:17.920
<v Speaker 1>Steve Bay is a monster.</v>

1563
00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:22.060
<v Speaker 1>You starched and congratulated him in the ring after this oh value of did and</v>

1566
00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:27.190
<v Speaker 1>But there was some weird thing where they cut the value of any made a face cause</v>

1567
00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:31.720
<v Speaker 1>a fader was making some sort of a speech and they cut the value of,</v>

1568

<v Speaker 1>I'm just speaking out of like a,</v>

1572
00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:41.530
<v Speaker 1>I would say probably what they do.</v>

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:42.393
<v Speaker 1>Which Putin there,</v>

1574

<v Speaker 1>Evan notably Vladimir Putin.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Are you scared if Hillary Clinton wins?</v>

1581
00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:54.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

1582

1588
00:41:04.811 --> 00:41:05.050
<v Speaker 3>of them.</v>

1589
00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:06.190
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump is not going to,</v>

1590
00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:07.480
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to let him be president.</v>

1591
00:41:07.481 --> 00:41:08.740
<v Speaker 3>That was just a big distraction.</v>

1592
00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.200
<v Speaker 3>They put them in there to make sure Hillary wins.</v>

1593
00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:12.423
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

1594
00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:14.770

00:41:18.281 --> 00:41:21.040
<v Speaker 3>It's all you think is a sound sensor.</v>

1597
00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:22.303
<v Speaker 3>Tower seven.</v>

1598
00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:23.860
<v Speaker 3>What do you think you'd think,</v>

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1600
00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:29.220
<v Speaker 3>you think that the election was rigged with Bernie Sanders in California and</v>

1601
00:41:29.261 --> 00:41:29.591
<v Speaker 3>Hillary,</v>

1602
00:41:29.591 --> 00:41:30.424
<v Speaker 3>you think it was rigged?</v>

1603
00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:32.680
<v Speaker 3>You look into it at all.</v>

1604
00:41:32.681 --> 00:41:33.514
<v Speaker 3>He didn't into it.</v>

1605
00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 3>I did not</v>

1606
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:35.150
<v Speaker 1>think it was rigged.</v>

1607
00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:36.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1608
00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:40.190
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely some sort of a problem with there was votes at weren't</v>

1609
00:41:40.191 --> 00:41:40.700
<v Speaker 1>counted,</v>

1610
00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:40.921
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1611
00:41:40.921 --> 00:41:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1612
00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:41.781
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much.</v>

1613
00:41:41.781 --> 00:41:42.240
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1614
00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:45.440
<v Speaker 1>History and really being in the Bernie Carlson pull more land to,</v>

1615
00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:46.040
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

1616
00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:46.480
<v Speaker 1>Eddie,</v>

1617
00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:46.680
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1618
00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:47.360
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

1619
00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:49.880
<v Speaker 4>A friend of mine who I follow on Facebook.</v>

1620
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:50.743
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1621
00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.670
<v Speaker 4>he was really big in the Bernie campaign,</v>

1622
00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:53.440
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1623
00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.740
<v Speaker 4>falling a lot of it,</v>

1624
00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:56.120
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1625
00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.670
<v Speaker 4>posting things all throughout the last couple of months.</v>

1626
00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:01.460
<v Speaker 4>He was even making posters that were going viral online for it,</v>

1627
00:42:01.461 --> 00:42:03.320
<v Speaker 4>helping voters for registrations and whatnot.</v>

1628
00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:05.960
<v Speaker 4>His vote wasn't counted and it said,</v>

1629
00:42:05.961 --> 00:42:09.590
<v Speaker 4>because he didn't sign this thing and he is adamant that he hundred percent</v>

1630
00:42:09.591 --> 00:42:12.740
<v Speaker 4>followed everything to the t double checked all this stuff they're telling you</v>

1631
00:42:12.741 --> 00:42:12.841
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

1632
00:42:12.841 --> 00:42:13.880
<v Speaker 4>but it won't be counted a hundred.</v>

1633
00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:15.520
<v Speaker 1>And so what is,</v>

1634
00:42:15.521 --> 00:42:16.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1635
00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:19.090
<v Speaker 1>so what's the conspiracy conspiracy theory?</v>

1636
00:42:19.091 --> 00:42:19.924
<v Speaker 1>Is that uh,</v>

1637
00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:20.893
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1638
00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:24.490
<v Speaker 1>that Hillary's campaign is actively suppressing votes?</v>

1639
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:30.030
<v Speaker 1>Is it that or is it that there's a bunch of people that are zealous and they,</v>

1640
00:42:30.311 --> 00:42:30.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1641
00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:35.650
<v Speaker 1>they identify with the Hillary Party and they work some in some way,</v>

1642
00:42:35.651 --> 00:42:39.290
<v Speaker 1>shape or form and counting side.</v>

1643
00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:41.020
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't count.</v>

1644
00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:41.621
<v Speaker 1>That's what that means.</v>

1645
00:42:41.621 --> 00:42:42.251
<v Speaker 1>Everyone don't have to be,</v>

1646
00:42:42.251 --> 00:42:42.381
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1647
00:42:42.381 --> 00:42:43.960
<v Speaker 1>I voted if you didn't vote,</v>

1648
00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:45.130
<v Speaker 1>don't fucking complain.</v>

1649
00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:45.850
<v Speaker 1>Guess what?</v>

1650
00:42:45.850 --> 00:42:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Your phone didn't count.</v>

1651
00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:47.140
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1652
00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:47.321
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1653
00:42:47.321 --> 00:42:48.160
<v Speaker 1>I totally get that.</v>

1654
00:42:48.161 --> 00:42:48.880
<v Speaker 1>But I'm saying like,</v>

1655
00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:50.620
<v Speaker 1>what do you think is the mechanism?</v>

1656
00:42:50.621 --> 00:42:52.240
<v Speaker 1>Like what's actually happening here?</v>

1657
00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:57.420
<v Speaker 1>Is it because they think that Hillary's parlor,</v>

1658
00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:58.660
<v Speaker 1>so Hillary,</v>

1659
00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:02.520
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's some sort of concerted effort to make her win even though they</v>

1660
00:43:02.521 --> 00:43:03.301
<v Speaker 1>know she wasn't wearing.</v>

1661
00:43:03.301 --> 00:43:06.160
<v Speaker 1>She's part of the team and she's what she's can apply no matter what you're</v>

1662
00:43:06.161 --> 00:43:06.640
<v Speaker 1>selling,</v>

1663
00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:07.090
<v Speaker 1>no matter what.</v>

1664
00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:07.750
<v Speaker 1>Here's the question.</v>

1665
00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:08.583
<v Speaker 1>Here's a real question.</v>

1666
00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.630
<v Speaker 1>Who's doing that and how is that,</v>

1667
00:43:10.631 --> 00:43:14.500
<v Speaker 1>how is it the people that are working in the campaign offices and in the</v>

1668
00:43:14.501 --> 00:43:16.000
<v Speaker 1>election was the government?</v>

1669
00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:16.421
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1670
00:43:16.421 --> 00:43:17.920
<v Speaker 1>the people that are working in election offices,</v>

1671
00:43:17.921 --> 00:43:19.480
<v Speaker 1>the people that count elections,</v>

1672
00:43:19.481 --> 00:43:19.661
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1673
00:43:19.661 --> 00:43:20.530
<v Speaker 1>They count results.</v>

1674
00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:25.360
<v Speaker 1>They must have some kind of political bias,</v>

1675
00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:25.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1676
00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:27.520
<v Speaker 1>They must meet people do.</v>

1677
00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Everyone does.</v>

1678
00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:30.700
<v Speaker 1>Some people are just naturally democratic.</v>

1679
00:43:30.701 --> 00:43:32.320
<v Speaker 1>Some people are naturally conservative.</v>

1680
00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:33.183
<v Speaker 1>They'd have to.</v>

1681
00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:34.570
<v Speaker 1>How do they account for that?</v>

1682
00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:36.220
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to something like this,</v>

1683
00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:37.150
<v Speaker 1>like when you have,</v>

1684
00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:38.950
<v Speaker 1>what is the excuse,</v>

1685
00:43:38.951 --> 00:43:39.784
<v Speaker 1>like what's the,</v>

1686
00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:40.401
<v Speaker 1>what is the,</v>

1687
00:43:40.401 --> 00:43:43.660
<v Speaker 1>the the reason they're saying why these votes weren't counted.</v>

1688
00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:47.280
<v Speaker 4>Provisional ballots is something I've heard come up a lot and they're going to</v>

1689
00:43:47.281 --> 00:43:49.170
<v Speaker 4>be counted over an extended period of time.</v>

1690
00:43:49.171 --> 00:43:51.060
<v Speaker 4>But they've already made calls for things.</v>

1691
00:43:51.061 --> 00:43:51.480
<v Speaker 4>So that,</v>

1692
00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:52.313
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how that felt,</v>

1693
00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:52.931
<v Speaker 1>but the dude,</v>

1694
00:43:52.931 --> 00:43:53.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1695
00:43:53.291 --> 00:43:55.270
<v Speaker 1>said that his stuff wasn't signed right.</v>

1696
00:43:55.271 --> 00:43:56.140
<v Speaker 1>They said he wasn't signed.</v>

1697
00:43:56.410 --> 00:43:57.590
<v Speaker 1>Did you take a photo of it?</v>

1698
00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:58.710
<v Speaker 4>Screenshot.</v>

1699
00:43:58.710 --> 00:43:59.400
<v Speaker 4>I sought,</v>

1700
00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:01.950
<v Speaker 4>I think that you said he's got even eye witnesses that saw him.</v>

1701
00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:03.453
<v Speaker 1>He has a,</v>

1702
00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:04.980
<v Speaker 1>he has a screen shot of him.</v>

1703
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:08.470
<v Speaker 4>Not a screenshot that it was a screenshot of like his,</v>

1704
00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:12.290
<v Speaker 4>the response to the voter registration things set that says vote wasn't it?</v>

1705
00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:13.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1706
00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:13.983
<v Speaker 1>whistleblowers.</v>

1707
00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:16.040
<v Speaker 1>Whistleblower came out and made a video.</v>

1708
00:44:16.041 --> 00:44:17.570
<v Speaker 1>She made a video and explained everything,</v>

1709
00:44:17.571 --> 00:44:18.890
<v Speaker 1>how they trained or what to do.</v>

1710
00:44:18.891 --> 00:44:23.210
<v Speaker 1>And what they did is they supposedly,</v>

1711
00:44:23.211 --> 00:44:24.044
<v Speaker 1>this is what she said,</v>

1712
00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:26.390
<v Speaker 1>that they told her that anybody,</v>

1713
00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:29.690
<v Speaker 1>cause you could vote for a candidate but not be part of a party.</v>

1714
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:30.351
<v Speaker 1>You could just say,</v>

1715
00:44:30.351 --> 00:44:31.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm not Democrat.</v>

1716
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a Republican.</v>

1717
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:33.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm a whatever her name.</v>

1718
00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:34.470
<v Speaker 1>There's a name for it.</v>

1719
00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:36.060
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1720
00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:36.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1721
00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:37.351
<v Speaker 1>political,</v>

1722
00:44:37.351 --> 00:44:38.460
<v Speaker 1>whatever representation.</v>

1723
00:44:38.461 --> 00:44:39.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck it is,</v>

1724
00:44:39.361 --> 00:44:40.080
<v Speaker 1>but you're,</v>

1725
00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:40.950
<v Speaker 1>you're that third,</v>

1726
00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:42.060
<v Speaker 1>that third class.</v>

1727
00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:44.550
<v Speaker 1>So if most of those people were voting for Bernie,</v>

1728
00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:46.110
<v Speaker 1>so they weren't either,</v>

1729
00:44:46.111 --> 00:44:47.490
<v Speaker 1>they weren't Democrat or Republican,</v>

1730
00:44:47.491 --> 00:44:50.430
<v Speaker 1>so they were on that third pile and that third pound on and those votes got</v>

1731
00:44:50.431 --> 00:44:51.050
<v Speaker 1>counted.</v>

1732
00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:51.450
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

1733
00:44:51.450 --> 00:44:51.990
<v Speaker 1>That's what,</v>

1734
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:54.780
<v Speaker 1>that's what the conspiracy theory is and that's huge shit.</v>

1735
00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:55.471
<v Speaker 1>Huge,</v>

1736
00:44:55.471 --> 00:44:56.010
<v Speaker 1>huge.</v>

1737
00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:56.843
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1738
00:44:56.930 --> 00:44:57.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1739
00:44:57.330 --> 00:44:57.960
<v Speaker 1>that's an,</v>

1740
00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:58.920
<v Speaker 1>your vote doesn't count.</v>

1741
00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Well that's also what happened during the Al Gore,</v>

1742
00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:06.200
<v Speaker 1>George W elections where they said that if you actually counted the real numbers</v>

1743
00:45:07.171 --> 00:45:11.370
<v Speaker 1>of people that voted like all that dangling Chad Bullshit,</v>

1744
00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:14.640
<v Speaker 1>if you actually count the actual results after they sorted it all out,</v>

1745
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:15.833
<v Speaker 1>Al Gore won.</v>

1746
00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:16.950
<v Speaker 1>He won the election.</v>

1747
00:45:17.650 --> 00:45:19.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is like pretty well established,</v>

1748
00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:23.820
<v Speaker 1>but it's one of those things where you know how referee stops a fight for the</v>

1749
00:45:23.821 --> 00:45:24.654
<v Speaker 1>wrong reason.</v>

1750
00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:25.950
<v Speaker 1>Once they stopped the fight,</v>

1751
00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:26.760
<v Speaker 1>the fight stopped.</v>

1752
00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:26.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1753
00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:27.520
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing.</v>

1754
00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:29.320
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of the same thing with [inaudible].</v>

1755
00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:34.850
<v Speaker 1>They're so terrified of this idea of losing the power that they get from</v>

1756
00:45:35.101 --> 00:45:37.140
<v Speaker 1>controlling the leader of the world,</v>

1757
00:45:37.141 --> 00:45:38.220
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what it is.</v>

1758
00:45:38.221 --> 00:45:39.990
<v Speaker 1>When you just decided someone's a president,</v>

1759
00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:41.430
<v Speaker 1>if you got to a point where you're like,</v>

1760
00:45:41.431 --> 00:45:42.211
<v Speaker 1>this is so stupid,</v>

1761
00:45:42.211 --> 00:45:43.260
<v Speaker 1>why are we still having presence?</v>

1762
00:45:43.261 --> 00:45:47.250
<v Speaker 1>And everybody agreed there'd be no one person that would have that position of</v>

1763
00:45:47.251 --> 00:45:47.700
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

1764
00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:49.080
<v Speaker 1>They're so terrified of that,</v>

1765
00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:50.303
<v Speaker 1>that even in it,</v>

1766
00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:54.990
<v Speaker 1>it like some sort of a crazy dispute where Al Gore like may or may have not.</v>

1767
00:45:54.991 --> 00:45:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Obviously I didn't count them,</v>

1768
00:45:55.981 --> 00:45:58.740
<v Speaker 1>but if you count them all up and you listen to a lot of the people that did,</v>

1769
00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:00.750
<v Speaker 1>they said that Al Gore won that election.</v>

1770
00:46:00.751 --> 00:46:03.420
<v Speaker 1>He should have won that election easy and like we're not even going to entertain</v>

1771
00:46:03.421 --> 00:46:04.190
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1772
00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:05.330
<v Speaker 1>Just not even going to entertain.</v>

1773
00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:06.690
<v Speaker 1>And Adler backs away.</v>

1774
00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:08.840
<v Speaker 1>And then the same thing happened with Carrie didn't,</v>

1775
00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:10.020
<v Speaker 1>same thing happened with Carrie.</v>

1776
00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:13.620
<v Speaker 1>There was like some dispute as to whether or not carry one or didn't mean Al</v>

1777
00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:13.861
<v Speaker 1>Gore was a,</v>

1778
00:46:13.861 --> 00:46:14.910
<v Speaker 1>for sure thing,</v>

1779
00:46:14.911 --> 00:46:15.661
<v Speaker 1>k was close.</v>

1780
00:46:15.661 --> 00:46:17.430
<v Speaker 1>But Carrie was an issue too.</v>

1781
00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:17.821
<v Speaker 1>There was a,</v>

1782
00:46:17.821 --> 00:46:19.740
<v Speaker 1>there was some sort of a dispute with Carrie too.</v>

1783
00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:21.180
<v Speaker 1>I think with all those guys,</v>

1784
00:46:21.181 --> 00:46:24.930
<v Speaker 1>it's like the game is so fucking wacky.</v>

1785
00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:30.350
<v Speaker 1>It's so the game of controlling the Geo political power of the world and</v>

1786
00:46:31.051 --> 00:46:35.640
<v Speaker 1>controlling the greatest nation the world has ever known and the best people we</v>

1787
00:46:35.641 --> 00:46:36.220
<v Speaker 1>can get.</v>

1788
00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:38.340
<v Speaker 1>The people that were we're voting on right now,</v>

1789
00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:39.091
<v Speaker 1>it's ridiculous.</v>

1790
00:46:39.091 --> 00:46:43.260
<v Speaker 1>All the smartest people aren't going to run to watch a documentary on Youtube</v>

1791
00:46:43.261 --> 00:46:45.540
<v Speaker 1>called behind the Iran Contra affair.</v>

1792
00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:47.100
<v Speaker 1>You'll get to see,</v>

1793
00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:48.480
<v Speaker 1>this is all public shit.</v>

1794
00:46:48.481 --> 00:46:53.100
<v Speaker 1>The Iran Contra affair that shows you how ever help help people get honey deck.</v>

1795
00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:54.240
<v Speaker 1>It shows you everything.</v>

1798
00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:01.200
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking nuts.</v>

1799
00:47:01.201 --> 00:47:02.820
<v Speaker 1>Don't get a star on top seven.</v>

1800
00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:04.230
<v Speaker 1>Well we don't have to go to that though.</v>

1801
00:47:04.231 --> 00:47:07.740
<v Speaker 1>I rent contract fares is undeniable.</v>

1802
00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:08.783
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those,</v>

1803
00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:14.430
<v Speaker 1>the Iran Contra affair is one of those conspiracy theories that's so legit and</v>

1804
00:47:14.431 --> 00:47:19.020
<v Speaker 1>so verified and so proven that it opens a door to a lot of other stuff cause you</v>

1805
00:47:19.021 --> 00:47:19.141
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

1806
00:47:19.141 --> 00:47:19.980
<v Speaker 1>well wait a minute.</v>

1807
00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:22.530
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck did they think they could pull off this?</v>

1808
00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:23.160
<v Speaker 1>How do they,</v>

1809
00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:28.160
<v Speaker 1>how did they sell drugs in the La Ghettos to fund these crazy military</v>

1810
00:47:29.471 --> 00:47:30.230
<v Speaker 1>operations?</v>

1811
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:31.063
<v Speaker 1>Nothing centuries,</v>

1812
00:47:31.530 --> 00:47:32.220
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1813
00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:33.430
<v Speaker 1>What they did,</v>

1814
00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:39.100
<v Speaker 1>it was they sold drugs in the ghetto like they sold,</v>

1815
00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:40.330
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1816
00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:41.163
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing,</v>

1817
00:47:41.290 --> 00:47:42.080
<v Speaker 1>if you know,</v>

1818
00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:43.990
<v Speaker 1>it was like two dozen people running all that shit.</v>

1819
00:47:43.991 --> 00:47:44.860
<v Speaker 1>They're not that many.</v>

1820
00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:45.521
<v Speaker 1>Not that many.</v>

1821
00:47:45.521 --> 00:47:45.711
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1822
00:47:45.711 --> 00:47:47.500
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the things that the CIA guys,</v>

1823
00:47:47.501 --> 00:47:47.801
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

1824
00:47:47.801 --> 00:47:50.110
<v Speaker 1>when you get to know them and you start communicating with them and realize,</v>

1825
00:47:50.111 --> 00:47:50.800
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1826
00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:55.090
<v Speaker 1>there's some cowboys that realize that they're kind of operating on their own</v>

1827
00:47:55.091 --> 00:47:57.400
<v Speaker 1>and they realized they could make a lot of money and they went for it.</v>

1828
00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:58.720
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's what happened.</v>

1829
00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Military connection in a lot of tape makes it happen.</v>

1830
00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:04.180
<v Speaker 1>I think that happened in a lot of cases.</v>

1831
00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:08.170
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of dudes who sold drugs and did all kinds of other shit</v>

1832
00:48:08.171 --> 00:48:10.440
<v Speaker 1>because there's a lot of other people doing it and they,</v>

1833
00:48:10.441 --> 00:48:10.901
<v Speaker 1>they like,</v>

1834
00:48:10.901 --> 00:48:11.560
<v Speaker 1>fuck these people.</v>

1835
00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:11.791
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't,</v>

1836
00:48:11.791 --> 00:48:13.000
<v Speaker 1>should these people make this money?</v>

1837
00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:14.260
<v Speaker 1>And we could take this money.</v>

1838
00:48:14.261 --> 00:48:15.400
<v Speaker 1>And we can go do some other shit.</v>

1839
00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:16.510
<v Speaker 1>And they got caught with it.</v>

1840
00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:20.980
<v Speaker 1>They got caught funding the war with the contractors and the Sandinistas in</v>

1841
00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:21.671
<v Speaker 1>Nicaragua.</v>

1842
00:48:21.671 --> 00:48:23.500
<v Speaker 1>That was during the Oliver North trials.</v>

1843
00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:24.900
<v Speaker 1>All that crazy shit dude.</v>

1844
00:48:24.901 --> 00:48:25.734

1846
00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:28.400
<v Speaker 1>There's like here,</v>

1847
00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:32.680
<v Speaker 1>here it is right here was the 2004 election stolen Republican's prevented more</v>

1848
00:48:32.681 --> 00:48:33.514
<v Speaker 1>than,</v>

1849
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:34.301
<v Speaker 1>what does that say?</v>

1850
00:48:34.301 --> 00:48:39.190
<v Speaker 1>350,000 votes in Ohio article written by Robert F.</v>

1851
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:41.080
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy Jr in rolling stone.</v>

1852
00:48:41.290 --> 00:48:42.123
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

1853
00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:43.413
<v Speaker 1>Kenny Jr.</v>

1854
00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:43.721
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1855
00:48:43.721 --> 00:48:47.590
<v Speaker 1>so you see there's always these debates and disputes about elections,</v>

1856
00:48:47.591 --> 00:48:49.660
<v Speaker 1>but I think at a certain point in time,</v>

1857
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.950
<v Speaker 1>like as a people,</v>

1858
00:48:50.951 --> 00:48:52.390
<v Speaker 1>we have to come to this conclusion,</v>

1859
00:48:52.391 --> 00:48:56.260
<v Speaker 1>this idea of giving all the power to one group like this is just,</v>

1860
00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:57.550
<v Speaker 1>it's intoxicating.</v>

1861
00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:59.020
<v Speaker 1>It's dangerous,</v>

1862
00:48:59.021 --> 00:49:00.040
<v Speaker 1>it's not good for them.</v>

1863
00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:00.970
<v Speaker 1>It's not good for us.</v>

1864
00:49:00.971 --> 00:49:02.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not good for anybody.</v>

1865
00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:02.860
<v Speaker 1>We Shit,</v>

1866
00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:07.860
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't have these groups that have so much power over what you do or what</v>

1867
00:49:08.021 --> 00:49:08.681
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>

1868
00:49:08.681 --> 00:49:13.681
<v Speaker 1>And especially like what the fuck happens with the future of the world?</v>

1869
00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:15.370
<v Speaker 1>Like who are these people?</v>

1870
00:49:15.371 --> 00:49:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Like why?</v>

1871
00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:16.690
<v Speaker 1>Why do they?</v>

1872
00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Because we decide cause everybody raises their hand.</v>

1873
00:49:19.421 --> 00:49:20.470
<v Speaker 1>They point to a guy,</v>

1874
00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:21.550
<v Speaker 1>that guy gets to choose.</v>

1875
00:49:21.551 --> 00:49:22.720
<v Speaker 1>This is madness.</v>

1876
00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:24.130
<v Speaker 1>We get to stop doing it.</v>

1877
00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:24.973
<v Speaker 1>Old School,</v>

1878
00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:26.110
<v Speaker 1>it's old school for sure.</v>

1879
00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Ran Contra scandal was when Ronald Reagan was president and George Senior was</v>

1880
00:49:31.031 --> 00:49:31.751
<v Speaker 1>vice president.</v>

<v Speaker 1>George scene was vice president.</v>

1882

<v Speaker 1>He was the former director of the CIA.</v>

1883
00:49:36.221 --> 00:49:36.641
<v Speaker 1>He's right there.</v>

1884
00:49:36.641 --> 00:49:37.450
<v Speaker 1>Vice President,</v>

2119
00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.130
<v Speaker 3>They don't pay for them.</v>

2120
00:56:18.570 --> 00:56:22.500
<v Speaker 3>But if you had to pay for 500 more than a grant to go through it and like</v>

2121
00:56:22.501 --> 00:56:24.120
<v Speaker 3>fucking a half more than a grant attire</v>

2122
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:25.570
<v Speaker 1>for those because they have to be,</v>

2123
00:56:25.690 --> 00:56:27.700
<v Speaker 1>they have to be rated to go over 200 miles an hour,</v>

2124
00:56:27.701 --> 00:56:28.510
<v Speaker 1>not burn.</v>

2125
00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Those things are insane.</v>

2126
00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:30.731
<v Speaker 1>They're all slicks,</v>

2127
00:56:30.731 --> 00:56:30.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2128
00:56:30.971 --> 00:56:32.410
<v Speaker 1>they don't have any tread on them.</v>

2129
00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:34.360
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing about those tires.</v>

2130
00:56:34.370 --> 00:56:37.720
<v Speaker 1>They're like this really soft sticky component and so they,</v>

2131
00:56:37.810 --> 00:56:41.620
<v Speaker 1>they kinda like drive with them and heat them up and move around with them and</v>

2132
00:56:41.621 --> 00:56:43.690
<v Speaker 1>then once they heat them up real good,</v>

2133
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:45.940
<v Speaker 1>they become super adhesive.</v>

2134
00:56:45.941 --> 00:56:46.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2135
00:56:46.301 --> 00:56:47.290
<v Speaker 1>Real sticky.</v>

2136
00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:49.270
<v Speaker 1>And you could just take you down.</v>

2137
00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:49.761
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2138
00:56:49.761 --> 00:56:49.931
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2139
00:56:49.931 --> 00:56:52.330
<v Speaker 1>Stick to the crib to the road like a Gecko.</v>

2140
00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:54.370
<v Speaker 1>It's way better because you don't get as retired.</v>

2141
00:56:54.810 --> 00:56:55.900
<v Speaker 1>See that Jamie?</v>

2142
00:56:55.901 --> 00:56:56.920
<v Speaker 1>That's Nascar dog.</v>

2143
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:58.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about f one son.</v>

2144
00:56:58.410 --> 00:56:59.330
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be very,</v>

2145
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.070
<v Speaker 1>let's say three different kinds of four 50 leech.</v>

2146
00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:04.413
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly,</v>

2147
00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:07.300
<v Speaker 1>racing teams don't buy their tires.</v>

2148
00:57:07.301 --> 00:57:08.260
<v Speaker 1>They leased those,</v>

2149
00:57:08.650 --> 00:57:09.940
<v Speaker 1>they leased them from good year.</v>

2150
00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:12.880
<v Speaker 1>The official tire supplier of Nascar on race day.</v>

2151
00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:17.910
<v Speaker 1>Each team is allowed to lease 16 sets of four tires for this guy matter.</v>

2152
00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:23.560
<v Speaker 1>How crazy that 16 sets they,</v>

2153
00:57:23.690 --> 00:57:25.570
<v Speaker 1>it takes them 16 sets a fucking,</v>

2154
00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:27.490
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of fun.</v>

2155
00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:29.770
<v Speaker 1>Well that's because those things are super gummy man.</v>

2156
00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:31.480
<v Speaker 1>So like the really good racers,</v>

2157
00:57:31.481 --> 00:57:33.790
<v Speaker 1>they know when their tires are like ready to go,</v>

2158
00:57:33.791 --> 00:57:35.740
<v Speaker 1>they start feeling the slippage.</v>

2159
00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:36.580
<v Speaker 1>They start,</v>

2160
00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:39.550
<v Speaker 1>they're so sensitive and it's like really like their ass,</v>

2161
00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:41.640
<v Speaker 1>like their ass and their feet and their feet,</v>

2162
00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:43.630
<v Speaker 1>their hand connected to the wheel.</v>

2163
00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:43.961
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

2164
