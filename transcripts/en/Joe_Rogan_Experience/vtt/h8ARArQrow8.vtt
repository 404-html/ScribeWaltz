00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.700
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.500
<v Speaker 1>I remember the first time I got caught speeding.</v>

3
00:00:03.501 --> 00:00:07.430
<v Speaker 1>I was 16 and I just didn't have the money.</v>

4
00:00:07.431 --> 00:00:09.680
<v Speaker 1>So I thought if I broke down in tears,</v>

5
00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:10.514
<v Speaker 1>the copper,</v>

6
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:14.740
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

7
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.060
<v Speaker 2>of course he just fucking farming.</v>

8
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.130
<v Speaker 2>And the worst thing is</v>

9
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.570
<v Speaker 1>my brother is a cop and he reported it to my brother and then my brother teased</v>

10
00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:27.060
<v Speaker 1>me in the near future.</v>

11
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.610
<v Speaker 1>My brother used to do awful things as my brother.</v>

12
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.790
<v Speaker 1>My brother's named Denny nugent and I think that's a bad site.</v>

13
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.320
<v Speaker 1>He's a member of the rod squad now.</v>

14
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.700
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

15
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.750
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

16
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.100
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

17
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.960
<v Speaker 1>I was driving home and it's a 17,</v>

18
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:42.360
<v Speaker 1>which is still not the legal age to drink in Australia.</v>

19
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.460
<v Speaker 1>And I'm driving home and I had two beers now.</v>

20
00:00:45.461 --> 00:00:46.710
<v Speaker 1>I would have been under the limit,</v>

21
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.291
<v Speaker 1>but still,</v>

22
00:00:47.291 --> 00:00:49.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even allowed to have two beers in me because I'm 17.</v>

23
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

24
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.241
<v Speaker 1>I get pulled up,</v>

25
00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:52.230
<v Speaker 1>I get breathalyzed.</v>

26
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.831
<v Speaker 1>The guy goes,</v>

27
00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:53.790
<v Speaker 1>please breathe into the tube.</v>

28
00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:54.270
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

29
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.070
<v Speaker 1>my brother was a sergeant at that stage.</v>

30
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.941
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

31
00:00:56.941 --> 00:00:57.040
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

32
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.311
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

33
00:00:57.311 --> 00:00:57.791
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

34
00:00:57.791 --> 00:00:58.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

35
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.440
<v Speaker 2>denny nugent had nugent does a</v>

36
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.900
<v Speaker 1>right and that you guys know,</v>

37
00:01:01.901 --> 00:01:02.734
<v Speaker 1>I never heard of him.</v>

38
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:03.783
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

39
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.680
<v Speaker 1>So he goes off to his vehicle,</v>

40
00:01:05.681 --> 00:01:07.480
<v Speaker 1>is there for like 15 minutes.</v>

41
00:01:07.481 --> 00:01:08.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm just sitting in the car,</v>

42
00:01:08.471 --> 00:01:11.950
<v Speaker 1>just panicking now he comes back out and he goes,</v>

43
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.690
<v Speaker 1>step out of the vehicle or was there a problem?</v>

44
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Anything over just step out of the vehicle right now.</v>

45
00:01:15.791 --> 00:01:16.624
<v Speaker 1>So step out,</v>

46
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.260
<v Speaker 1>he cuffs me and smacks me under the bonnet of the car.</v>

47
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:21.620
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

48
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.310
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>

49
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.660
<v Speaker 2>oh Jesus Christ,</v>

50
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:24.830
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

51
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.331
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

52
00:01:25.331 --> 00:01:25.830
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

53
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.311
<v Speaker 2>Like this.</v>

54
00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:26.810
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

55
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.100
<v Speaker 2>And then I and my brother laugh</v>

56
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 1>being on the radio,</v>

57
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.730
<v Speaker 1>like he's actually gone back to his car radio station,</v>

58
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.230
<v Speaker 1>talked to my brother and he said,</v>

59
00:01:34.231 --> 00:01:35.160
<v Speaker 1>scare the shit out of him,</v>

60
00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:35.994
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

61
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.980
<v Speaker 2>Because it's cops and they go,</v>

62
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.080
<v Speaker 2>I was just joking with you.</v>

63
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:41.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm wiping tears away from where I was like,</v>

64
00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:42.510
<v Speaker 2>good job guys.</v>

65
00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:42.991
<v Speaker 2>Well done.</v>

66
00:01:42.991 --> 00:01:43.824
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>

67
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.000
<v Speaker 3>Hunting is just doing the same thing but on a,</v>

68
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.410
<v Speaker 3>on a more base level.</v>

69
00:01:50.411 --> 00:01:51.940
<v Speaker 3>Just on a smaller level</v>

70
00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.021
<v Speaker 4>in a way.</v>

71
00:01:53.021 --> 00:01:53.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

72
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.480
<v Speaker 3>you're just doing it.</v>

73
00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:54.691
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

74
00:01:54.691 --> 00:01:56.820
<v Speaker 3>you cutting out the middleman and you're cutting out,</v>

75
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.900
<v Speaker 4>you cut out the middleman and the animals live in completely wild.</v>

76
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.650
<v Speaker 4>This is like a concept behind hunting that certain types of people do.</v>

77
00:02:03.651 --> 00:02:04.730
<v Speaker 4>It's called fair chase,</v>

78
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.840
<v Speaker 4>and what that means is that you're not dealing with a fenced in environment,</v>

79
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.800
<v Speaker 4>that you're only hunting an animal that's truly wild wild animal.</v>

80
00:02:12.801 --> 00:02:13.820
<v Speaker 4>They can go wherever it wants.</v>

81
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.880
<v Speaker 4>So in order to harvest this animal,</v>

82
00:02:16.881 --> 00:02:19.430
<v Speaker 4>you have to figure out how to get close enough to it.</v>

83
00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:20.390
<v Speaker 4>You got to stock it,</v>

84
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.310
<v Speaker 4>you got a,</v>

85
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

86
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.720
<v Speaker 4>you gotta understand where the wind's blowing.</v>

87
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.600
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a lot of factors involved and when you take that animal,</v>

88
00:02:26.601 --> 00:02:31.070
<v Speaker 4>most likely that animal would not have even known you existed until it died out</v>

89
00:02:31.071 --> 00:02:31.491
<v Speaker 4>of nowhere.</v>

90
00:02:31.491 --> 00:02:34.250
<v Speaker 4>It just dies and it's the most ethical way.</v>

91
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.620
<v Speaker 4>But that animal's still scared as fuck.</v>

92
00:02:36.621 --> 00:02:37.490
<v Speaker 4>If it sees a person.</v>

93
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.920
<v Speaker 4>The reason banks is people like me that will shoot it</v>

94
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.800
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

95
00:02:41.801 --> 00:02:42.371
<v Speaker 3>I see that.</v>

96
00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:43.230
<v Speaker 3>Where's that bit?</v>

97
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.600
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

98
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.433
<v Speaker 3>just chilling out,</v>

99
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.760
<v Speaker 3>waiting to and has seen it.</v>

100
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.190
<v Speaker 3>It hasn't just seen his friends be slaughtered and hung up.</v>

101
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.531
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

102
00:02:49.531 --> 00:02:50.460
<v Speaker 4>it's not trapped,</v>

103
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:51.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

104
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.080
<v Speaker 4>it's a wild animal.</v>

105
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:53.550
<v Speaker 4>You're going out and getting a wild animal,</v>

106
00:02:53.551 --> 00:02:55.230
<v Speaker 4>but it's also wild animal.</v>

107
00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:57.900
<v Speaker 4>That's most of the time they're aware of people and then they don't want to be</v>

108
00:02:57.901 --> 00:02:58.734
<v Speaker 4>anywhere near us.</v>

109
00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.700
<v Speaker 4>The real,</v>

110
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.400
<v Speaker 4>the real tripper is when you can go and you could see a wild animal that</v>

111
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:07.360
<v Speaker 4>probably never saw a fucking human being like go up to the Yukon or some shit</v>

112
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 4>and then they freak out a,</v>

113
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 4>they don't even know what the fuck you are.</v>

114
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.300
<v Speaker 4>A caribou.</v>

115
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 4>Caribou will just look at you like,</v>

116
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:15.454
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is this?</v>

117
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.700
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes antelopes will come towards people because they don't know what the</v>

118
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:19.534
<v Speaker 4>fuck they are.</v>

119
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

120
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.471
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

121
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:21.304
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck are you?</v>

122
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.540
<v Speaker 4>I never seen one of you before.</v>

123
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:23.374
<v Speaker 4>And then</v>

124
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.480
<v Speaker 4>point blank.</v>

125
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

126
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.160
<v Speaker 4>Well not that close.</v>

127
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.450
<v Speaker 4>You just don't get that close,</v>

128
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:29.920
<v Speaker 4>but they will look at you.</v>

129
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.460
<v Speaker 4>But sometimes antelopes had encountered people and sometimes Caribou encounter</v>

130
00:03:33.461 --> 00:03:36.670
<v Speaker 4>people and once they've encountered people they would get way touch here.</v>

131
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.583
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

132
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.660
<v Speaker 5>Do you have a catchphrase when you hunt?</v>

133
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.073
<v Speaker 2>When you hit one?</v>

134
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.000
<v Speaker 2>I need one.</v>

135
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.953
<v Speaker 2>Let's</v>

136
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.610
<v Speaker 2>Blam Blam we eat.</v>

137
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.453
<v Speaker 2>Inhale,</v>

138
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.793
<v Speaker 2>that's awesome.</v>

139
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.090
<v Speaker 2>That's the perfect one for pig hunting.</v>

140
00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:58.770
<v Speaker 5>You know what I realized?</v>

141
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.800
<v Speaker 5>I realized a long time ago that cops and security guards do filler talk and they</v>

142
00:04:09.151 --> 00:04:13.650
<v Speaker 5>do filler talk so that you won't talk to them.</v>

143
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.600
<v Speaker 5>So if a,</v>

144
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.660
<v Speaker 5>if a cop pulls you over and goes</v>

145
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:25.270
<v Speaker 5>a license and ID plays a license and registration please and then just sits</v>

146
00:04:26.941 --> 00:04:27.774
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

147
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.310
<v Speaker 5>You'll start going,</v>

148
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.990
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>

149
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.210
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

150
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.561
<v Speaker 5>What,</v>

151
00:04:30.561 --> 00:04:30.861
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

152
00:04:30.861 --> 00:04:31.531
<v Speaker 5>what I do,</v>

153
00:04:31.531 --> 00:04:34.440
<v Speaker 5>or I was just keeping up the flow of traffic I wrote,</v>

154
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.900
<v Speaker 5>but instead they always come up and they go,</v>

155
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.561
<v Speaker 5>sir,</v>

156
00:04:37.561 --> 00:04:39.060
<v Speaker 5>when I go need you do for me right now,</v>

157
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.060
<v Speaker 5>go ahead and get your license and registration out for me.</v>

158
00:04:42.061 --> 00:04:42.331
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>

159
00:04:42.331 --> 00:04:45.450
<v Speaker 5>Right now and meanwhile they're doing this kind of pattern.</v>

160
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.220
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't mean anything.</v>

161
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.480
<v Speaker 5>What I'm gonna need you to do for me right now is to go ahead and get your</v>

162
00:04:51.481 --> 00:04:52.180
<v Speaker 5>license.</v>

163
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.050
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't mean anything other than license and registration.</v>

164
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.460
<v Speaker 5>They keep a nice sort of white noise buzz,</v>

165
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.020
<v Speaker 5>I should call it blue noise noise.</v>

166
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.070
<v Speaker 5>Cops make that stop you from going,</v>

167
00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:05.530
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

168
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:06.170
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

169
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.481
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

170
00:05:06.481 --> 00:05:10.260
<v Speaker 5>I was just pulling out of my car like they don't want to hear that bullshit,</v>

171
00:05:10.261 --> 00:05:15.261
<v Speaker 5>so they just keep that low grade talk going because it's only the cops that do</v>

172
00:05:15.391 --> 00:05:20.391
<v Speaker 5>the for me right now and a lot of preamble into when I'm going to have to ask</v>

173
00:05:22.321 --> 00:05:23.760
<v Speaker 5>you to do for me right now.</v>

174
00:05:23.761 --> 00:05:25.580
<v Speaker 5>So go ahead and get your license and.</v>

175
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:26.101
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

176
00:05:26.101 --> 00:05:26.934
<v Speaker 5>Right now,</v>

177
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.700
<v Speaker 5>do you ever speak that way to anybody?</v>

178
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.430
<v Speaker 5>I mean if I wanted you to pass me the salt,</v>

179
00:05:32.431 --> 00:05:32.760
<v Speaker 5>what I,</v>

180
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.050
<v Speaker 5>what I go Joe,</v>

181
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.680
<v Speaker 5>what I'm going to have to go ahead and do is ask you to pass me the salt.</v>

182
00:05:37.681 --> 00:05:37.921
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

183
00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:38.754
<v Speaker 5>Right now.</v>

184
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.010
<v Speaker 2>Or when I just say pass me the salt,</v>

185
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.170
<v Speaker 2>I can't hang out with them anymore.</v>

186
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.740
<v Speaker 2>It's just too many words.</v>

187
00:05:44.741 --> 00:05:45.574
<v Speaker 2>Oh Great.</v>

188
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm convinced they talked.</v>

189
00:05:48.591 --> 00:05:49.500
<v Speaker 2>So you don't go.</v>

190
00:05:49.501 --> 00:05:49.920
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

191
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.270
<v Speaker 2>Why am I turning around?</v>

192
00:05:51.271 --> 00:05:51.451
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

193
00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:52.231
<v Speaker 2>what's this mean?</v>

194
00:05:52.231 --> 00:05:52.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

195
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.220
<v Speaker 2>I didn't do anything.</v>

196
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

197
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.150
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

198
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.361
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

199
00:05:54.361 --> 00:05:55.141
<v Speaker 2>I totally understand.</v>

200
00:05:55.141 --> 00:05:56.710
<v Speaker 2>But something that lasts for six hours.</v>

201
00:05:56.711 --> 00:06:00.650
<v Speaker 2>So it seems like fuck boners that lasts for six hours.</v>

202
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.000
<v Speaker 2>We've talked about that.</v>

203
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.300
<v Speaker 2>All the problem.</v>

204
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:06.803
<v Speaker 2>It's a problem.</v>

205
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.690
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

206
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.080
<v Speaker 2>Did you wear a fanny pack or something to like actually just took one last</v>

207
00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:12.321
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>

208
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:13.430
<v Speaker 2>So I'm on it right now.</v>

209
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:14.830
<v Speaker 2>Or you</v>

210
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:19.610
<v Speaker 2>feel uncomfortable?</v>

211
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm amazed that you could feel comfortable over here.</v>

212
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.600
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

213
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.433
<v Speaker 2>he's breathing.</v>

214
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.640
<v Speaker 2>So you're saying you went out last night or did you just stay home alone?</v>

215
00:06:28.641 --> 00:06:31.580
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you just want to let everybody know what's up.</v>

216
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.320
<v Speaker 2>I got a massage last night,</v>

217
00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:34.810
<v Speaker 2>so I just did it before that</v>

218
00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.000
<v Speaker 2>massage in quotes,</v>

219
00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:38.834
<v Speaker 2>air quotes,</v>

220
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.840
<v Speaker 2>creeper.</v>

221
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.210
<v Speaker 2>It's just better that way.</v>

222
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.700
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

223
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.280
<v Speaker 2>we were living in trying times.</v>

224
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.300
<v Speaker 2>He just wanted to fuck with the massage.</v>

225
00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.680
<v Speaker 2>What an asshole fucking snake coming out of the top of past a turtle head.</v>

226
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.193
<v Speaker 2>What does that.</v>

227
00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.390
<v Speaker 2>What is the</v>

228
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.943
<v Speaker 2>pink?</v>

229
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:03.590
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

230
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.600
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

231
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.810
<v Speaker 2>We need to talk about everything.</v>

232
00:07:05.811 --> 00:07:06.611
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>

233
00:07:06.611 --> 00:07:07.550
<v Speaker 2>You can't just talk.</v>

234
00:07:07.551 --> 00:07:08.540
<v Speaker 2>Only about passionate people.</v>

235
00:07:08.541 --> 00:07:10.490
<v Speaker 2>Get bored of the same content for peaches over a number.</v>

236
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.660
<v Speaker 2>Then you brought up the boner.</v>

237
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:13.250
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

238
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.083
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

239
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:16.760
<v Speaker 2>I would bring it up to.</v>

240
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.270
<v Speaker 2>You're welcome.</v>

241
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:18.940
<v Speaker 2>If I was to check,</v>

242
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.670
<v Speaker 2>I'd been bringing up boners all day playing to me boners.</v>

243
00:07:22.671 --> 00:07:24.280
<v Speaker 2>Do you know in the comments later?</v>

244
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:24.980
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

245
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:25.641
<v Speaker 2>is it like,</v>

246
00:07:25.641 --> 00:07:26.920
<v Speaker 2>does it give you like a whispery,</v>

247
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.180
<v Speaker 2>like whistling in your ears?</v>

248
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:29.180
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

249
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:34.180
<v Speaker 2>the demon boners on its way between the worlds opens up just a creek and</v>

250
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.410
<v Speaker 2>spirits come flying through your fucking nervous system.</v>

251
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.313
<v Speaker 2>Spirits.</v>

252
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.213
<v Speaker 2>You feel them?</v>

253
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:43.143
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

254
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:45.611
<v Speaker 6>potentially.</v>

255
00:07:45.611 --> 00:07:46.820
<v Speaker 6>I think that I was,</v>

256
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.100
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

257
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:53.100
<v Speaker 6>we're now discovering that it's good for so many things,</v>

258
00:07:53.711 --> 00:07:54.370
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

259
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.260
<v Speaker 6>therapeutically for addictions,</v>

260
00:07:56.261 --> 00:07:57.160
<v Speaker 6>for depression,</v>

261
00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.440
<v Speaker 6>for ptsd and that sort of thing.</v>

262
00:07:59.441 --> 00:08:00.970
<v Speaker 6>And that's all to the good.</v>

263
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.600
<v Speaker 6>But we shouldn't make the mistake of thinking Iowasca is only for sick people.</v>

264
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:08.951
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

265
00:08:08.951 --> 00:08:09.241
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

266
00:08:09.241 --> 00:08:09.670
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

267
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:14.670
<v Speaker 6>we're all wounded and we all need to understand something about our relationship</v>

268
00:08:14.981 --> 00:08:15.814
<v Speaker 6>to nature,</v>

269
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:21.270
<v Speaker 6>potentially the paradigms that are emerging in Iowaska tourism or these more,</v>

270
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:23.831
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

271
00:08:23.831 --> 00:08:24.011
<v Speaker 6>these.</v>

272
00:08:24.011 --> 00:08:27.100
<v Speaker 6>I was centered spiritual communities in the states.</v>

273
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.290
<v Speaker 6>Potentially this has the,</v>

274
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:30.341
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

275
00:08:30.341 --> 00:08:34.240
<v Speaker 6>this may transform mental health care in this country.</v>

276
00:08:34.241 --> 00:08:39.241
<v Speaker 6>It may transform psychiatry and from that it might transform medicine and it</v>

277
00:08:39.941 --> 00:08:44.290
<v Speaker 6>might actually transform all these other institutions that we have to deal with</v>

278
00:08:44.291 --> 00:08:49.291
<v Speaker 6>whose values have become twisted over 2000 years of,</v>

279
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.320
<v Speaker 6>of bullshit and,</v>

280
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.410
<v Speaker 6>and indoctrination.</v>

281
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:54.613
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

282
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:55.533
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

283
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.260
<v Speaker 6>these institutions are not going away and they're fine.</v>

284
00:08:58.261 --> 00:09:03.261
<v Speaker 6>They just need to rediscover a moral dimension to the consequences of their</v>

285
00:09:04.201 --> 00:09:04.830
<v Speaker 6>action,</v>

286
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:06.240
<v Speaker 6>if that makes any sense.</v>

287
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:07.470
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

288
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:12.470
<v Speaker 6>our cleverness far exceeds our wisdom and that's a problem.</v>

289
00:09:13.651 --> 00:09:17.520
<v Speaker 6>That's the problem we've got to become wise.</v>

290
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.900
<v Speaker 6>And when we couple that with our ingenuity and our cleverness,</v>

291
00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:25.500
