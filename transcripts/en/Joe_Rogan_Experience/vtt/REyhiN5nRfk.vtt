WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a rush today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2
00:00:02.911 --> 00:00:03.780
<v Speaker 1>we live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gentlemen,</v>

3
00:00:03.781 --> 00:00:05.850
<v Speaker 1>welcome back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's up Joe?</v>

4
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.380
<v Speaker 1>So I watched a documentary last night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

5
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.330
<v Speaker 1>You Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had me twice already.</v>

6
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Really Holy Shit at me with bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger,</v>

7
00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:16.650
<v Speaker 1>faster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now your holy shit at me with a</v>

8
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.610
<v Speaker 1>prescription.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thugs.</v>

9
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.540
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

10
00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:22.170
<v Speaker 1>We have a $300,000,000,000 prescription</v>
<v Speaker 1>drug habit in this country,</v>

11
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.140
<v Speaker 1>yet we rank number 50 in life</v>
<v Speaker 1>expectancy.</v>

12
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.550
<v Speaker 1>It makes no sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

13
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.120
<v Speaker 1>it all came down to Ronald Reagan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's really crazy.</v>

14
00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:34.620
<v Speaker 1>When they allowed people to allow</v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical companies to advertise on</v>

15
00:00:34.621 --> 00:00:37.350
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can remember when those things first</v>

16
00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:38.600
<v Speaker 1>started showing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

17
00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:38.940
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

18
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.730
<v Speaker 1>medicine turned into a business and when</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turned to a business that wasn't a</v>

19
00:00:41.731 --> 00:00:45.150
<v Speaker 1>very good thing for the consumer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No at all.</v>

20
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.050
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's terrible.</v>

21
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.080
<v Speaker 1>How much further do you think life</v>
<v Speaker 1>expectancy has changed over the last</v>

22
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:52.740
<v Speaker 1>hundred years?</v>

23
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.770
<v Speaker 1>A well over the last hundred years I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think it's changed dramatically,</v>

24
00:00:55.771 --> 00:00:58.800
<v Speaker 1>but I think the last 50 years probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>not so much.</v>

25
00:00:58.801 --> 00:01:00.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from what I've seen,</v>

26
00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:02.310
<v Speaker 1>it's about 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that much.</v>

27
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much would you think it would be?</v>

28
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think it'd be more,</v>

29
00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:08.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hear about a modern medicine just</v>

30
00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:10.740
<v Speaker 1>being such a big thing and it being able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to help you and.</v>

31
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.090
<v Speaker 1>But we also have a tainted food supply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we're talking about a little bit</v>

32
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.680
<v Speaker 1>that that's really hard to get healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be healthy.</v>

33
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.220
<v Speaker 1>Totally healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

34
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.480
<v Speaker 1>it requires effort for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It definitely requires you to pay</v>

35
00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:24.090
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It definitely requires you to watch what</v>

36
00:01:24.091 --> 00:01:26.130
<v Speaker 1>you eat and most people don't want to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

37
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.850
<v Speaker 1>But what's stunning to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was a lot of stunning</v>

38
00:01:29.851 --> 00:01:34.740
<v Speaker 1>things in that documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the sheer numbers of prescription</v>

39
00:01:34.741 --> 00:01:37.500
<v Speaker 1>pain pills that are prescribed in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country every year,</v>

40
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.090
<v Speaker 1>that's staggering.</v>

41
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.430
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the actual quote that there was</v>

42
00:01:41.431 --> 00:01:46.431
<v Speaker 1>enough pain pills to get every single</v>
<v Speaker 1>adult human in this country high for a</v>

43
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.860
<v Speaker 1>month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a month around the clock for a month</v>

44
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.560
<v Speaker 1>turned everybody zombies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How fucking insane is that?</v>

45
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Kinda what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

46
00:01:54.121 --> 00:01:57.030
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people are just walking around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>checked out and um,</v>

47
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing that I didn't know when I was</v>

48
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.010
<v Speaker 1>when I was addicted to painkillers was</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually ivy to Ibuprofen and Tylenol</v>

49
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.670
<v Speaker 1>has been clinically proven to be like</v>
<v Speaker 1>twice as effective as opiate</v>

50
00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:12.360
<v Speaker 1>painkillers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if a doctor told me as a patient to</v>

51
00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:15.090
<v Speaker 1>take Ibuprofen and tylenol together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have like,</v>

52
00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:16.080
<v Speaker 1>you're out of your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me the,</v>

53
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.240
<v Speaker 1>give me the good stuff that you wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel he's doing enough for you.</v>

54
00:02:18.241 --> 00:02:20.400
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a mentality that we have</v>

55
00:02:20.401 --> 00:02:23.420
<v Speaker 1>and it's mentality that like I totally</v>
<v Speaker 1>admit to his family,</v>

56
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.560
<v Speaker 1>to a doctor I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to get a prescription,</v>

57
00:02:25.561 --> 00:02:27.300
<v Speaker 1>but now I've changed that mentality.</v>

58
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.870
<v Speaker 1>But that's the mentality I did have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you go to a doctor and they give</v>

59
00:02:30.871 --> 00:02:33.990
<v Speaker 1>you prescription Ibuprofen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they give you 800 milligrams.</v>

60
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.450
<v Speaker 1>So two is four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

61
00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:40.650
<v Speaker 1>It's 400 milligrams for two Ibuprofen</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then two tylenol,</v>

62
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.430
<v Speaker 1>which I don't know what the milligrams</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Tylenol is.</v>

63
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't usually take that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have arthritis really bad.</v>

64
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.150
<v Speaker 1>My knees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had my hips replaced at 33 years old.</v>

65
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.830
<v Speaker 1>My ankles hurt everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything and the advil and tylenol</v>

66
00:02:52.831 --> 00:02:55.560
<v Speaker 1>combination has been knocking it out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the park for me.</v>

67
00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:58.260
<v Speaker 1>It actually learned that from doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>press for this movie.</v>

68
00:02:58.261 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 1>I learned that from Dr drew of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

69
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.963
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

70
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.220
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how long you've been doing that?</v>

71
00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:04.940
<v Speaker 1>Like two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two advil in two Ibuprofen,</v>

72
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 1>two months about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it makes a big difference.</v>

73
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.210
<v Speaker 1>It just helps me get through the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Helps me be pain free,</v>

74
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:11.020
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

75
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about that I think just definitely</v>

76
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:17.380
<v Speaker 1>needs to be talked about is medical</v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana because I'm an addict and I've</v>

77
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 1>been through Rehab and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't personally use it,</v>

78
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:23.320
<v Speaker 1>but I think for people that don't have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with consuming everything,</v>

79
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.100
<v Speaker 1>I think it can be great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have a problem too in the sense</v>

80
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:29.890
<v Speaker 1>that like even marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's not physically</v>

81
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 1>addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you start smoking that you'll want</v>

82
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:33.040
<v Speaker 1>other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm only.</v>

83
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.430
<v Speaker 1>I've only been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>been sober about 22 months so I just</v>

84
00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:40.420
<v Speaker 1>feel like I'm not ready to really take</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dive because I might smoke some</v>

85
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:41.940
<v Speaker 1>weed and then ended up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 1>taking some pills and drinking and</v>
<v Speaker 1>jumping in the pool naked and going to</v>

87
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:46.624
<v Speaker 1>jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

88
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.280
<v Speaker 1>what if you just get naked for jumping</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the pool naked if you get arrested</v>

89
00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:51.620
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>

90
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.740
<v Speaker 1>But that wouldn't be the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would keep going.</v>

91
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.780
<v Speaker 1>He and I were talking the other day a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit about like,</v>

92
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants to justify their drug of</v>

93
00:03:57.971 --> 00:03:59.170
<v Speaker 1>choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

94
00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:02.350
<v Speaker 1>obviously I've been on performance</v>
<v Speaker 1>enhancing drugs for a long time and so</v>

95
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:04.960
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants to justify,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh it's not addicting or it's not this</v>

96
00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:06.610
<v Speaker 1>or not that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is addicting.</v>

97
00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Any behavior that you practice over and</v>
<v Speaker 1>over again is going to become addicted</v>

98
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.800
<v Speaker 1>and like the side effects to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

99
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:13.930
<v Speaker 1>like some of the field to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everybody,</v>

100
00:04:13.931 --> 00:04:16.690
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of times kind of kidding</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and they're saying,</v>

101
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:17.950
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pot doesn't do anything.</v>

102
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:18.784
<v Speaker 1>Or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

103
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.210
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it does something.</v>

104
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make you function the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably,</v>

105
00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:24.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it certainly can be psychologically</v>

106
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:25.960
<v Speaker 1>addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly.</v>

107
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.621
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

108
00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:28.930
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it helps her functioning in some ways.</v>

109
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.250
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have gotten mad at me for a fucking bad</v>

110
00:04:32.251 --> 00:04:33.630
<v Speaker 1>ass at video games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

111
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.880
<v Speaker 1>What else you at pool for sure helps of</v>
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>

112
00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:37.714
<v Speaker 1>Like honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

113
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.570
<v Speaker 1>they're like God put everything if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in God or whatever,</v>

114
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.070
<v Speaker 1>but we have a system like everything is</v>
<v Speaker 1>put on this earth for a reason and if,</v>

115
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always say let medicine hypocrisy</v>

116
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.010
<v Speaker 1>said like let medicine be thy cure and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cure be medicine,</v>

117
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.970
<v Speaker 1>food be medicine or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like food as medicine is something</v>

118
00:04:54.971 --> 00:04:56.920
<v Speaker 1>that tracy is like way back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

119
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.040
<v Speaker 1>so things that are found on the earth</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can use rather than</v>

120
00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:02.950
<v Speaker 1>synthetically make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it just makes logical sense.</v>

121
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

122
00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Well it definitely is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably a smarter way to do it is</v>

123
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:07.900
<v Speaker 1>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name is hypocrisy,</v>

124
00:05:07.901 --> 00:05:09.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that awkward?</v>

125
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.040
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>awkward.</v>

126
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.690
<v Speaker 1>You're onto something eponymous one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them old dead Greek motherfuckers.</v>

127
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

128
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.680
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sheer numbers of oxycontins and pain</v>

129
00:05:26.681 --> 00:05:28.300
<v Speaker 1>pills that are being prescribed in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

130
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.090
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching this television show</v>

131
00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:34.120
<v Speaker 1>where they were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts and the problem.</v>

132
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was Anthony Bourdain show.</v>

133
00:05:35.261 --> 00:05:37.000
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were talking about all these</v>

134
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:41.380
<v Speaker 1>people that got hooked on pain pills</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're good injured from some</v>

135
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.220
<v Speaker 1>job related or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or another doctor gives you a oxy</v>

136
00:05:45.221 --> 00:05:48.130
<v Speaker 1>prescription,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your oxygen prescription runs out or</v>

137
00:05:48.131 --> 00:05:50.920
<v Speaker 1>they changed the regulations and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody turns to heroin.</v>

138
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.210
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big problem in this country</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they've changed the regulations.</v>

139
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was another that you talked</v>

140
00:05:58.161 --> 00:06:01.640
<v Speaker 1>about on your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your documentary where they changed</v>

141
00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:06.500
<v Speaker 1>the way Oxycontin's work or you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>crush them up and smoke them anymore and</v>

142
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:08.750
<v Speaker 1>they lost 80 percent of their revenue</v>
<v Speaker 1>from that.</v>

143
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

144
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.590
<v Speaker 1>And that's something that just shows you</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people are using them</v>

145
00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:14.930
<v Speaker 1>recreationally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how insane is that?</v>

146
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:16.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was one of the most staggering</v>

147
00:06:16.671 --> 00:06:20.360
<v Speaker 1>facts of the whole movie I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we just came back from the Arnold</v>

148
00:06:20.361 --> 00:06:23.540
<v Speaker 1>classic and we know there's some guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead lifting.</v>

149
00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.980
<v Speaker 1>We went to this pro deadlift event and</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys are pulling seven,</v>

150
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.870
<v Speaker 1>800 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One guy was kind of in an almost a 900</v>

151
00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:32.740
<v Speaker 1>pound range,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he ran into somebody backstage at</v>

152
00:06:32.741 --> 00:06:35.840
<v Speaker 1>said he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just saw the film and he lost his son</v>

153
00:06:35.841 --> 00:06:36.920
<v Speaker 1>to what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heroin,</v>

154
00:06:36.921 --> 00:06:38.660
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It started as oxycotton.</v>

155
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.550
<v Speaker 1>It went to heroin where you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he told me,</v>

156
00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:41.241
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

157
00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:43.280
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't gonna lift anymore.</v>

158
00:06:43.281 --> 00:06:46.640
<v Speaker 1>I just gave up on everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw your movie like a couple months</v>

159
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.451
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

160
00:06:47.451 --> 00:06:48.530
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go,</v>

161
00:06:48.531 --> 00:06:50.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go dead lift at this</v>
<v Speaker 1>program thing.</v>

162
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.680
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a movie.</v>

163
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.900
<v Speaker 1>Made it possible for me to get over what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to my son to realize like,</v>

164
00:06:55.901 --> 00:06:58.250
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't so much his fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right as he thought.</v>

165
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:59.480
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

166
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.690
<v Speaker 1>I think just stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he told me that I was completely</v>

167
00:07:02.691 --> 00:07:03.910
<v Speaker 1>fine talking to the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walked away,</v>

168
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.580
<v Speaker 1>just started bawling because I know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can even affect one person and</v>

169
00:07:07.581 --> 00:07:09.830
<v Speaker 1>that's the power of film and</v>
<v Speaker 1>documentaries.</v>

170
00:07:09.831 --> 00:07:11.210
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're trying to do.</v>

171
00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:12.830
<v Speaker 1>Well in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's on the right track because he</v>

172
00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:17.150
<v Speaker 1>said that now I feel it's my duty to</v>
<v Speaker 1>help other people and I think that's the</v>

173
00:07:17.151 --> 00:07:19.670
<v Speaker 1>way people need to try to look at stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to try to,</v>

174
00:07:19.671 --> 00:07:20.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

175
00:07:20.211 --> 00:07:24.620
<v Speaker 1>we're here as human beings to learn from</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences and then I think we're all</v>

176
00:07:24.621 --> 00:07:28.010
<v Speaker 1>put here to help each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well can definitely help.</v>

177
00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean for someone like that to reach</v>
<v Speaker 1>out and find other people who have also</v>

178
00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:36.320
<v Speaker 1>lost people and you can help each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can also maybe help someone who</v>

179
00:07:36.321 --> 00:07:41.321
<v Speaker 1>is maybe thinking or would go down that</v>
<v Speaker 1>path and watches your documentary and</v>

180
00:07:41.571 --> 00:07:41.960
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

181
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.410
<v Speaker 1>there's a real danger here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

182
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.470
<v Speaker 1>The place that I went to cliffside</v>
<v Speaker 1>Malibu.</v>

183
00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:50.120
<v Speaker 1>I have three people or three people</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now that are in Rehab there that</v>

184
00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:54.080
<v Speaker 1>have contacted me from watching the film</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's really hard to get into a lot</v>

185
00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:55.640
<v Speaker 1>of rehabs because of insurance</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>

186
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another huge problem in this</v>

187
00:07:57.831 --> 00:07:59.920
<v Speaker 1>country is the insurance companies don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to pay for.</v>

188
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.090
<v Speaker 1>They expect somebody to be smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking,</v>

189
00:08:02.091 --> 00:08:05.270
<v Speaker 1>doing whatever for 30 years and on wine</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in 15 days.</v>

190
00:08:05.271 --> 00:08:06.530
<v Speaker 1>And that's just not gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

191
00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.210
<v Speaker 1>people need 90 days of treatment.</v>

192
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:12.080
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to go to a drug rehab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need 90 days and so you need 90 days</v>

193
00:08:12.081 --> 00:08:15.500
<v Speaker 1>where you're not working 90 days where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just staying in this place.</v>

194
00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:16.970
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it 90 days?</v>

195
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.910
<v Speaker 1>Think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're working right and you're a drug</v>

196
00:08:19.911 --> 00:08:22.490
<v Speaker 1>addict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What productive work are you doing?</v>

197
00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Like let the guy go for 90 days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to come back a new person.</v>

198
00:08:25.251 --> 00:08:26.900
<v Speaker 1>I think that that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have to,</v>

199
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.680
<v Speaker 1>we have to unplug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

200
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.160
<v Speaker 1>there's no other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

201
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.420
<v Speaker 1>I think that it just leads to an early</v>
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

202
00:08:32.421 --> 00:08:33.254
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we don't,</v>

203
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:38.260
<v Speaker 1>that's so hard for people to have work</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they need to get money now you can</v>

204
00:08:38.691 --> 00:08:39.710
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

205
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:41.660
<v Speaker 1>you can get out a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

206
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.130
<v Speaker 1>Like wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you did,</v>

207
00:08:43.131 --> 00:08:43.551
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

208
00:08:43.551 --> 00:08:44.031
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

209
00:08:44.031 --> 00:08:46.160
<v Speaker 1>I actually made this movie while I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>still in Rehab,</v>

210
00:08:46.161 --> 00:08:49.490
<v Speaker 1>so there's definitely time to do things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

211
00:08:49.491 --> 00:08:50.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

212
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.310
<v Speaker 1>you've got to look at it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

213
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.050
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can like almost like killing people</v>

214
00:08:54.051 --> 00:08:55.390
<v Speaker 1>find inside jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

215
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 1>That's</v>

216
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:56.843
<v Speaker 2>pretty talented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take.</v>

217
00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:01.950
<v Speaker 2>I can't take 90 days to like just</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely like fix my life,</v>

218
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I dunno.</v>

219
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.510
<v Speaker 2>I think time is more important to get to</v>
<v Speaker 2>give the time.</v>

220
00:09:06.511 --> 00:09:10.320
<v Speaker 2>And you need like a full 60 though where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're pretty much total isolation right</v>

221
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:14.460
<v Speaker 2>through the first 30 days or actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives pretty much totally kind of</v>

222
00:09:14.461 --> 00:09:15.450
<v Speaker 2>unplugged from everybody.</v>

223
00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.490
<v Speaker 3>You just stayed up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what,</v>

224
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:18.610
<v Speaker 3>what do you do with your time?</v>

225
00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:20.710
<v Speaker 2>You're in a lot of meetings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

226
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.140
<v Speaker 2>it's all like peer groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

227
00:09:22.141 --> 00:09:24.990
<v Speaker 2>you're basically like with other people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are addicted to drugs.</v>

228
00:09:24.991 --> 00:09:28.890
<v Speaker 2>And I would say like probably 80 percent</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the people that were in rehab or</v>

229
00:09:28.891 --> 00:09:29.724
<v Speaker 2>prescription drug.</v>

230
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:33.980
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>effective methods of stopping people</v>

231
00:09:33.981 --> 00:09:38.981
<v Speaker 3>from doing drugs is Ibogaine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a psychedelic ritual drug that they</v>

232
00:09:40.491 --> 00:09:41.500
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>

233
00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:43.100
<v Speaker 3>you can't do it in America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's illegal,</v>

234
00:09:43.101 --> 00:09:45.980
<v Speaker 3>but they have clinics in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Buddy ed clay,</v>

235
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:50.900
<v Speaker 3>he got hooked on pills and he had a real</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem with same thing,</v>

236
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:54.560
<v Speaker 3>pain pills and was really despondent and</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up.</v>

237
00:09:54.561 --> 00:09:57.080
<v Speaker 3>Went down there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did a,</v>

238
00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:02.170
<v Speaker 3>an Ibogaine ceremony and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>came back 100 percent clean and now he</v>

239
00:10:02.421 --> 00:10:05.360
<v Speaker 3>runs a clinic down there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any idea what that does for you?</v>

240
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.720
<v Speaker 3>Like do something your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could google it,</v>

241
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.270
<v Speaker 3>but there's some sort of an effect that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does.</v>

242
00:10:11.271 --> 00:10:16.271
<v Speaker 3>We're literally shuts down addiction and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's deeply troublingly introspective</v>

243
00:10:17.361 --> 00:10:19.520
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it explores the dark</v>

244
00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:22.780
<v Speaker 2>site.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking crazy.</v>

245
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm hearing it for the first time,</v>

246
00:10:24.891 --> 00:10:27.560
<v Speaker 2>but address from one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the first time you've heard of</v>

247
00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:30.030
<v Speaker 2>Ibogaine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Haven't haven't really ventured into</v>

248
00:10:30.031 --> 00:10:31.940
<v Speaker 2>that and to figuring that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

249
00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:33.860
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd never heard of it.</v>

250
00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:35.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the crazy thing about doing these</v>

251
00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:37.820
<v Speaker 2>documentaries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're going to meet other</v>

252
00:10:37.821 --> 00:10:40.790
<v Speaker 2>interesting people like yourself and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>pick up more knowledge now.</v>

253
00:10:40.791 --> 00:10:41.780
<v Speaker 2>That's something I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

254
00:10:41.781 --> 00:10:42.640
<v Speaker 2>well what is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

255
00:10:42.641 --> 00:10:43.850
<v Speaker 2>and go look into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

256
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:46.970
<v Speaker 2>but what you're saying makes a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense because it all,</v>

257
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:50.060
<v Speaker 2>it's all in the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You create these pathways in your brain</v>

258
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:53.150
<v Speaker 2>that just basically you habituate and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do the same thing that you like and</v>

259
00:10:53.151 --> 00:10:57.070
<v Speaker 2>it's the same thing with lifting weights</v>
<v Speaker 2>or doing Jujitsu or do you tend to that?</v>

260
00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.400
<v Speaker 2>That feels really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>

261
00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:00.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go to Jujitsu again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go to the gym again,</v>

262
00:11:00.741 --> 00:11:03.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it definitely makes sense that it's</v>

263
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:04.570
<v Speaker 2>something that will trigger some</v>

264
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:05.830
<v Speaker 3>than in the brain to fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

265
00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.330
<v Speaker 3>It also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently I haven't done Ibogaine,</v>

266
00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:11.890
<v Speaker 3>but the people that I know that have had</v>
<v Speaker 3>problems with pills and gone down there</v>

267
00:11:11.891 --> 00:11:13.810
<v Speaker 3>and done it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also people that have also had other</v>

268
00:11:13.811 --> 00:11:15.970
<v Speaker 3>problematic behavior that they wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>

269
00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:21.930
<v Speaker 3>It allows you to look at yourself</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally for the first time in like a</v>

270
00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.920
<v Speaker 3>deeply introspective of almost</v>
<v Speaker 3>abrasively way.</v>

271
00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:27.220
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not almost,</v>

272
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:29.510
<v Speaker 3>but very abrasively in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

273
00:11:29.511 --> 00:11:32.000
<v Speaker 3>in that it looks at every aspect of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>person</v>

274
00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:35.900
<v Speaker 2>and that's part of Rehab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be honest with yourself.</v>

275
00:11:35.901 --> 00:11:37.610
<v Speaker 2>If you're not honest with yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll never get better.</v>

276
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:38.581
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

277
00:11:38.581 --> 00:11:42.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure people that are bullshit and in</v>
<v Speaker 3>line and that's why one of the reasons</v>

278
00:11:42.751 --> 00:11:44.190
<v Speaker 3>why it's so important to hit rock</v>
<v Speaker 3>bottom,</v>

279
00:11:44.191 --> 00:11:44.540
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

280
00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to say I could stop any day.</v>

281
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:47.910
<v Speaker 2>My girlfriend said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well stop.</v>

282
00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:48.511
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

283
00:11:48.511 --> 00:11:51.960
<v Speaker 2>And I stopped for seven days and after</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven days I took pills and drank more</v>

284
00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:54.310
<v Speaker 2>than I ever did in my entire building</v>

285
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.880
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

286
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:55.570
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

287
00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.000
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ended up in the hospital and my</v>

288
00:11:58.001 --> 00:12:00.040
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend called my brother and he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one who was like,</v>

289
00:12:00.041 --> 00:12:00.970
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just get him here.</v>

290
00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Like he was in Sacramento.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

291
00:12:02.861 --> 00:12:04.270
<v Speaker 1>just get them here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually just moved.</v>

292
00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:08.530
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy just to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a random phone call in the middle</v>

293
00:12:08.531 --> 00:12:10.390
<v Speaker 1>of the night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't normally answer my phone all</v>

294
00:12:10.391 --> 00:12:11.740
<v Speaker 1>that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

295
00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:13.090
<v Speaker 1>and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

296
00:12:13.091 --> 00:12:14.980
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just randomly picked it up for some</v>

297
00:12:14.981 --> 00:12:18.530
<v Speaker 1>reason it was from a Philadelphia or</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pennsylvania right in the column there.</v>

298
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:21.940
<v Speaker 1>That's where she's from originally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she was just in a total panic.</v>

299
00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:24.670
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't understand what she was even</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

300
00:12:24.671 --> 00:12:26.530
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know who it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

301
00:12:26.531 --> 00:12:27.700
<v Speaker 1>this is lauren.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

302
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:28.541
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know any chicks.</v>

303
00:12:28.541 --> 00:12:30.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>

304
00:12:30.851 --> 00:12:31.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

305
00:12:31.311 --> 00:12:32.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who it is.</v>

306
00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.560
<v Speaker 1>And then it took me a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I finally heard her say,</v>

307
00:12:35.561 --> 00:12:37.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris's girlfriend,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And then she started to calm down and</v>

312
00:12:44.981 --> 00:12:45.521
<v Speaker 1>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mad Dog.</v>

316
00:12:51.731 --> 00:12:53.380
<v Speaker 1>It had a lot of people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

317
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:54.700
<v Speaker 1>after they see bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger,</v>

318
00:12:54.701 --> 00:12:57.160
<v Speaker 1>faster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was the first film that featured</v>

319
00:12:57.161 --> 00:13:00.790
<v Speaker 1>my family and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody asks about mad dog because</v>

320
00:13:00.791 --> 00:13:04.210
<v Speaker 1>everybody in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after watching that film worried about</v>

321
00:13:04.211 --> 00:13:06.310
<v Speaker 1>him and a lot of concern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't even know that he passed</v>

322
00:13:06.311 --> 00:13:09.760
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some days you're fine handling it</v>

323
00:13:09.761 --> 00:13:13.300
<v Speaker 1>because I feel like it's our obligation</v>
<v Speaker 1>to kind of talk about it to help other</v>

324
00:13:13.301 --> 00:13:15.850
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes you're just not ready for</v>

325
00:13:15.851 --> 00:13:17.620
<v Speaker 1>the blind sides and it's just fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurts.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

348
00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:07.900
<v Speaker 1>you're the only person there that he has</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like,</v>

349
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of like family.</v>

350
00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.380
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to go inside the apartment,</v>

351
00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:14.230
<v Speaker 1>make sure he doesn't have any keys and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just make sure he's alive,</v>

352
00:14:14.231 --> 00:14:15.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>checking on him.</v>

353
00:14:15.191 --> 00:14:18.130
<v Speaker 1>So she did all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She made sure he was okay.</v>

354
00:14:18.131 --> 00:14:19.570
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>luckily he was okay,</v>

355
00:14:19.571 --> 00:14:22.220
<v Speaker 1>but he was just passed out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

356
00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:27.310
<v Speaker 1>then my wife and I came together and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just devise a plan to figure out how the</v>

357
00:14:27.311 --> 00:14:29.770
<v Speaker 1>fuck do we get them to Sacramento,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

358
00:14:29.771 --> 00:14:30.551
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we going to do?</v>

359
00:14:30.551 --> 00:14:33.280
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we were talking about it and I was</v>

360
00:14:33.281 --> 00:14:35.020
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if I just book a flight for him,</v>

361
00:14:35.021 --> 00:14:37.750
<v Speaker 1>he's not going to fucking come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably like tomorrow morning he's not</v>

362
00:14:37.751 --> 00:14:39.590
<v Speaker 1>going to feel fine and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

363
00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:41.360
<v Speaker 1>got an 8:00 AM flight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

364
00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:46.480
<v Speaker 1>going through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel so fragile now.</v>

365
00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:49.990
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm a completely different person</v>
<v Speaker 1>after going through that.</v>

366
00:14:49.991 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 1>It humbles the shit out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It</v>

367
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.350
<v Speaker 2>makes you just feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I feel really fragile.</v>

368
00:14:54.351 --> 00:14:57.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't sometimes I don't know how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with people or how to talk to</v>

369
00:14:57.141 --> 00:15:00.350
<v Speaker 2>people because I'm just completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>different than I was before I went</v>

370
00:15:00.351 --> 00:15:02.420
<v Speaker 2>through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is just in a couple of years?</v>

371
00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:03.810
<v Speaker 2>About five years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

372
00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:07.790
<v Speaker 2>I've being on being on pills and</v>
<v Speaker 2>tractable when he felt invincible when I</v>

373
00:15:07.791 --> 00:15:11.030
<v Speaker 2>was doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now I feel so vulnerable and I don't</v>

374
00:15:11.031 --> 00:15:13.400
<v Speaker 2>know why that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's something that I think is</v>

375
00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:17.120
<v Speaker 2>definitely a warning to anybody out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there that's thinking of getting on</v>

376
00:15:17.121 --> 00:15:20.890
<v Speaker 2>prescription drugs or prescription drugs</v>
<v Speaker 2>pushed on them from their doctor.</v>

377
00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:25.900
<v Speaker 2>Remember the advil and tylenol works</v>
<v Speaker 2>better than opiate painkillers and</v>

378
00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:29.600
<v Speaker 2>people can look that up and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>walk away from it feeling like I feel</v>

379
00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:33.400
<v Speaker 3>I know this guy who has a back injury</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was always.</v>

380
00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.790
<v Speaker 3>He always was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was always trying to figure out what,</v>

381
00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:38.960
<v Speaker 3>what his deal was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He always just seemed awkward,</v>

382
00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:44.240
<v Speaker 3>awkward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but socially like not like</v>

383
00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:46.970
<v Speaker 3>inappropriate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like almost fearless,</v>

384
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:50.390
<v Speaker 3>like oblivious and clumsy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was always like,</v>

385
00:15:50.391 --> 00:15:53.600
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is going on with this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we were trying to figure it out.</v>

386
00:15:53.601 --> 00:15:55.040
<v Speaker 3>Like there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something going on.</v>

387
00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.540
<v Speaker 3>And then one day he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

388
00:15:56.541 --> 00:15:57.620
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's,</v>

00:15:57.621 --> 00:15:59.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on with this cryo therapy</v>

390
00:15:59.331 --> 00:16:01.000
<v Speaker 3>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Started asking me about cryotherapy.</v>

391
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.911
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

392
00:16:01.911 --> 00:16:03.710
<v Speaker 3>it's really good for reducing</v>
<v Speaker 3>inflammation.</v>

393
00:16:03.711 --> 00:16:07.400

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:09.490
<v Speaker 3>it helps your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rick kickstart.</v>

395
00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.290
<v Speaker 3>It's a production of Collagen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really good for a lot of things.</v>

396
00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:14.590
<v Speaker 3>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like it for the anti-inflammation</v>

397
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:15.111
<v Speaker 3>benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

398
00:16:15.111 --> 00:16:16.400
<v Speaker 3>why would you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

401
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:21.860
<v Speaker 3>And then it clicked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

402
00:16:21.861 --> 00:16:22.870
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

403
00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:26.690
<v Speaker 3>Pills all the time as a mother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because he would be like,</v>

404
00:16:26.691 --> 00:16:28.160
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are you guys doing?</v>

405
00:16:28.161 --> 00:16:29.750
<v Speaker 3>What's going on over?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How's.</v>

406
00:16:29.751 --> 00:16:31.970
<v Speaker 3>Everybody wasn't like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

407
00:16:31.971 --> 00:16:33.660
<v Speaker 3>sometimes people are friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're like,</v>

408
00:16:33.661 --> 00:16:37.130
<v Speaker 3>are you okay with me being in front of</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like a little touch and go there,</v>

409
00:16:37.131 --> 00:16:39.490
<v Speaker 3>figuring it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy was just falls</v>

410
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:43.850
<v Speaker 3>out loud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't shit pilled up man.</v>

411
00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.253
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

412
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.540
<v Speaker 3>we were uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>together with a bunch of other friends</v>

413
00:16:47.541 --> 00:16:48.950
<v Speaker 3>that we know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was just,</v>

414
00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.270
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was odd.</v>

415
00:16:50.271 --> 00:16:52.320
<v Speaker 3>We were trying to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like not a bad guy,</v>

416
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:55.430
<v Speaker 3>but just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just this weird,</v>

417
00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.320
<v Speaker 3>like almost like I was envious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

418
00:16:57.321 --> 00:17:01.190
<v Speaker 3>why is this guy so confidence?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

419
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:05.210
<v Speaker 3>fucking outerspace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish you guys go.</v>

420
00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:07.160
<v Speaker 3>Was it good?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks good.</v>

421
00:17:07.161 --> 00:17:08.560
<v Speaker 3>Looking at a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

422
00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:10.970
<v Speaker 3>I brought you over here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was weird.</v>

423
00:17:10.971 --> 00:17:13.010
<v Speaker 3>I was always trying to figure out what</v>
<v Speaker 3>was going on with this guy.</v>

424
00:17:13.011 --> 00:17:16.940
<v Speaker 3>And then once he approached me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>started asking me about the Cryo therapy</v>

425
00:17:16.941 --> 00:17:18.710
<v Speaker 3>thing and how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I do it all the time.</v>

426
00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.060
<v Speaker 3>Then he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

427
00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:23.300
<v Speaker 3>started slowly revealing that he's had a</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty traumatic,</v>

428
00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:25.940
<v Speaker 3>a back surgery or a back injury.</v>

429
00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:29.890
<v Speaker 2>The thing that was great for me that</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened a doing bigger,</v>

430
00:17:29.891 --> 00:17:32.200
<v Speaker 2>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>faster and doing this movie is you</v>

431
00:17:32.201 --> 00:17:35.290
<v Speaker 2>become almost like a priest where people</v>
<v Speaker 2>come to you and confess.</v>

432
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:38.140
<v Speaker 2>And so everybody comes out of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>woodwork.</v>

433
00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:39.460
<v Speaker 2>You made a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

434
00:17:39.461 --> 00:17:40.420
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do pills,</v>

435
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:41.860
<v Speaker 2>or hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take steroids.</v>

436
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:43.143
<v Speaker 2>Big Deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

437
00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:46.810
<v Speaker 2>and you talk about what happened and</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the effects were and what the</v>

438
00:17:46.811 --> 00:17:49.440
<v Speaker 2>negative effects were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people just come to you and say,</v>

439
00:17:49.441 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Speaker 2>Hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've</v>

440
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.790
<v Speaker 1>had a pill problem for 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

441
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:53.110
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

442
00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:56.250
<v Speaker 1>that's how these people got into Rehab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they called me?</v>

443
00:17:56.251 --> 00:17:57.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>

444
00:17:57.271 --> 00:17:59.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kid that worked on the movie,</v>

445
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:05.390
<v Speaker 1>he worked on the movie and he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually the president of the company's,</v>

446
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:08.640
<v Speaker 1>like a brother and he was the one that</v>
<v Speaker 1>called me and said,</v>

447
00:18:08.641 --> 00:18:08.971
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

448
00:18:08.971 --> 00:18:10.290
<v Speaker 1>I know I've worked on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're moving everything.</v>

449
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.240
<v Speaker 1>I have a problem though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

450
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.430
<v Speaker 1>after I saw the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just need to fix it.</v>

451
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.520
<v Speaker 1>What do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it incredible?</v>

452
00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:18.240
<v Speaker 1>These fucking people that are running</v>
<v Speaker 1>for president,</v>

453
00:18:18.241 --> 00:18:20.070
<v Speaker 1>not a single one has brought any of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit up.</v>

454
00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:24.030
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about a massive epidemic</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people are dropping like flies.</v>

455
00:18:24.031 --> 00:18:25.980
<v Speaker 1>People were being addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not sexy.</v>

456
00:18:25.981 --> 00:18:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Probably things we'll talk about is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark thing to talk about.</v>

457
00:18:28.081 --> 00:18:28.810
<v Speaker 1>Even watching a movie.</v>

458
00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:30.870
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a dark thing to get into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just that,</v>

459
00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:33.720
<v Speaker 1>it's that they can't talk about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because then they'll face repercussions</v>

460
00:18:33.721 --> 00:18:37.020
<v Speaker 1>for pharmaceutical industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump is the only person that can talk</v>

461
00:18:37.021 --> 00:18:37.621
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

462
00:18:37.621 --> 00:18:39.330
<v Speaker 1>I hope he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope he does too.</v>

463
00:18:39.331 --> 00:18:41.400
<v Speaker 1>I think it's donald trump's</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

464
00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:44.070
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump are calling you out right</v>
<v Speaker 1>here that we're calling you out,</v>

465
00:18:44.071 --> 00:18:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Donald.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goofy.</v>

466
00:18:45.781 --> 00:18:48.450
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swear I'll vote for you if you say</v>

467
00:18:48.451 --> 00:18:51.150
<v Speaker 1>something about he's listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bell Brothers,</v>

468
00:18:51.151 --> 00:18:51.984
<v Speaker 1>Ronnie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's into it.</v>

469
00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:54.400
<v Speaker 1>He's kind of busy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

470
00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:57.180
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big problem is that one of the</v>

471
00:18:57.181 --> 00:19:00.210
<v Speaker 1>biggest problems this country special</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest because it doesn't matter what</v>

472
00:19:00.211 --> 00:19:02.460
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's all these special interests</v>

473
00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:06.640
<v Speaker 1>including the corn industry trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>push high fructose corn syrup on it.</v>

474
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:08.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything you're looking at.</v>

475
00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:10.710
<v Speaker 1>There's a sugar lobby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the corn lobby,</v>

476
00:19:10.711 --> 00:19:15.090
<v Speaker 1>there's lobby for everything and it just</v>
<v Speaker 1>twists the truth around and makes</v>

477
00:19:15.091 --> 00:19:16.250
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

478
00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.210
<v Speaker 1>maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vote for things that they maybe</v>

479
00:19:18.211 --> 00:19:18.690
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't.</v>

480
00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:22.260
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting though that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistic that when they changed the</v>

481
00:19:22.261 --> 00:19:24.090
<v Speaker 1>Oxycontin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they changed the formula where you</v>

482
00:19:24.091 --> 00:19:26.760
<v Speaker 1>couldn't crush it and smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they lost 80 percent of their profit.</v>

483
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:32.240
<v Speaker 1>At least that tells us that some people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are looking out in the right direction</v>

484
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:37.110
<v Speaker 1>and absolutely they're doing so because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of things like your documentary and it's</v>

485
00:19:37.111 --> 00:19:40.560
<v Speaker 1>one of the most important things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing a documentary like that.</v>

486
00:19:40.561 --> 00:19:44.040
<v Speaker 1>It starts this conversation and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>start talking about it and you start</v>

487
00:19:44.041 --> 00:19:46.140
<v Speaker 1>comparing notes and they start realizing</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

488
00:19:46.141 --> 00:19:48.420
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are people that I know people</v>

489
00:19:48.421 --> 00:19:50.520
<v Speaker 1>around me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just this is a giant issue.</v>

490
00:19:50.521 --> 00:19:52.290
<v Speaker 1>I have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in my movie,</v>

491
00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.630
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people wanted me to give more</v>
<v Speaker 1>answers.</v>

492
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:55.890
<v Speaker 1>What's the solution?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

493
00:19:55.891 --> 00:19:59.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't really have a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a giant problem that we need to</v>

494
00:19:59.461 --> 00:20:04.461
<v Speaker 1>talk about and come up with bigger</v>
<v Speaker 1>solutions because I'm just a documentary</v>

495
00:20:04.681 --> 00:20:05.160
<v Speaker 1>film maker.</v>

496
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm just telling you what happened in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

497
00:20:07.381 --> 00:20:10.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to run for president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to make a make a law</v>

498
00:20:10.861 --> 00:20:11.760
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>

499
00:20:11.761 --> 00:20:13.170
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a big problem.</v>

500
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:16.400
<v Speaker 1>What are we supposed to do about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I think that's</v>

501
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.890
<v Speaker 1>collectively as a country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we come up with what the solution is a</v>

502
00:20:19.891 --> 00:20:24.630
<v Speaker 1>real problem in that these people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sell these things are making ungodly</v>

503
00:20:24.631 --> 00:20:27.840
<v Speaker 1>amounts of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you showed that seminar that they</v>

504
00:20:27.841 --> 00:20:30.190
<v Speaker 1>had where they were all talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

505
00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:33.600
<v Speaker 1>you guys are going to make insane</v>
<v Speaker 1>amounts of money and they were just</v>

506
00:20:33.601 --> 00:20:38.580
<v Speaker 1>openly talking about how their drug</v>
<v Speaker 1>patch right here actually wrote this</v>

507
00:20:38.581 --> 00:20:41.000
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this drug it's called Avandia,</v>

508
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:42.420
<v Speaker 1>was for diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

509
00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.370
<v Speaker 1>And so they're given this drug to all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people with diabetes and the</v>

510
00:20:45.371 --> 00:20:47.710
<v Speaker 1>dropping dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One third of the people that were</v>

511
00:20:47.711 --> 00:20:48.280
<v Speaker 1>prescribed</v>

512
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.570
<v Speaker 2>the drug were dying from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

513
00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:54.760
<v Speaker 2>And so what it was was a drug for</v>
<v Speaker 2>diabetes that actually gave you a heart</v>

514
00:20:54.761 --> 00:20:56.500
<v Speaker 2>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And most of the people that have</v>

515
00:20:56.501 --> 00:20:58.870
<v Speaker 2>diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the number one cause of death,</v>

516
00:20:58.871 --> 00:21:00.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you look at that,</v>

517
00:21:00.611 --> 00:21:01.061
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

518
00:21:01.061 --> 00:21:02.410
<v Speaker 2>well how did this company get away with</v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

519
00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:03.850
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they made the drug,</v>

520
00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:08.590
<v Speaker 2>they packed away $6,000,000,000 in an</v>
<v Speaker 2>account just to basically,</v>

521
00:21:08.591 --> 00:21:08.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

522
00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:10.150
<v Speaker 2>they put $6,000,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

523
00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.430
<v Speaker 2>Because they knew they were going to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>sued and they ended up getting,</v>

524
00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:13.850
<v Speaker 2>getting sued only for 3 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

525
00:21:13.851 --> 00:21:14.291
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

526
00:21:14.291 --> 00:21:16.360
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they made like $20 million on the</v>

527
00:21:16.361 --> 00:21:16.791
<v Speaker 2>drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

528
00:21:16.791 --> 00:21:19.720
<v Speaker 2>it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The things that are going on that are</v>

529
00:21:19.721 --> 00:21:22.540
<v Speaker 2>getting covered up and nobody's talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about like in the film,</v>

530
00:21:22.541 --> 00:21:25.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you saw that drug that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was made in the United States.</v>

531
00:21:25.511 --> 00:21:29.260
<v Speaker 2>It was tainted with AIDS.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was tainted with the AIDS virus and</v>

532
00:21:29.261 --> 00:21:30.041
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

533
00:21:30.041 --> 00:21:31.870
<v Speaker 2>Well we can't lose this big batch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>

534
00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:34.770
<v Speaker 2>Let's send it to France.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is.</v>

535
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand that though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does the AIDS virus get into this?</v>

536
00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:43.690
<v Speaker 2>What is the AIDS virus?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about HIV.</v>

537
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:45.850
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea,</v>

538
00:21:45.851 --> 00:21:47.360
<v Speaker 2>but that's where the news report says</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

539
00:21:47.361 --> 00:21:51.170
<v Speaker 2>Say the news report was all grainy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was from 1985.</v>

540
00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:53.680
<v Speaker 2>They might not know what the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're talking about now.</v>

541
00:21:53.681 --> 00:21:56.890
<v Speaker 2>It would definitely was something that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a head scratcher and I actually have</v>

542
00:21:56.891 --> 00:21:58.980
<v Speaker 2>a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy that works out at mark's.</v>

543
00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:02.890
<v Speaker 2>Jim just got his phd and he was going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go work for the company bear.</v>

544
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:05.800
<v Speaker 2>That was a company that sold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make their aspirin everything.</v>

545
00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:08.290
<v Speaker 2>That's a company that did it and I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things he was.</v>

546
00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:09.400
<v Speaker 2>He was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

547
00:22:09.401 --> 00:22:10.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I want to work for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>company like that.</v>

548
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to snopes snopes that before you</v>

549
00:22:14.291 --> 00:22:15.670
<v Speaker 2>put it in the documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

550
00:22:15.671 --> 00:22:16.504
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

551
00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:19.120
<v Speaker 2>We have a big team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Taste tastes a few of those.</v>

552
00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.530
<v Speaker 2>When we do these documentaries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have.</v>

553
00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:24.890
<v Speaker 2>Look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a team of people.</v>

554
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.033
<v Speaker 2>Fact check everything.</v>

555
00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.090
<v Speaker 3>The little larger police here it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Recently,</v>

556
00:22:29.091 --> 00:22:32.510
<v Speaker 3>unearth documents show that the drug</v>
<v Speaker 3>company beer sold millions of dollars</v>

557
00:22:32.511 --> 00:22:36.860
<v Speaker 3>worth of injectable blood clotting</v>
<v Speaker 3>medicine factor eight,</v>

558
00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:41.210
<v Speaker 3>concentrate intended for haemophiliacs</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Asian Latin American in some European</v>

559
00:22:41.211 --> 00:22:44.960
<v Speaker 3>countries in the mid 19 eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although they knew it was tainted with</v>

560
00:22:44.961 --> 00:22:46.160
<v Speaker 3>aids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

561
00:22:46.161 --> 00:22:47.420
<v Speaker 3>that's what I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how so</v>

562
00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.160
<v Speaker 2>tatum aids go together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

563
00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:54.170
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ten years ago,</v>

564
00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.030
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so as the company stopped selling the</v>

565
00:22:56.031 --> 00:23:00.050
<v Speaker 3>drug in the United States in 1984,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but continue to sell it overseas for an</v>

566
00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:02.940
<v Speaker 3>additional year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the medicine was made using a combined.</v>

567
00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:03.793
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

568
00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:08.180
<v Speaker 3>Plasma from large numbers of donors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And at the time there was no screening</v>

569
00:23:08.181 --> 00:23:12.200
<v Speaker 3>test for eight for the AIDS virus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a tiny number of donors with AIDS</v>

570
00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:15.410
<v Speaker 3>could inadvertently contaminate a large</v>
<v Speaker 3>batch.</v>

571
00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:19.670
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They continued to sell the medicine</v>

572
00:23:19.671 --> 00:23:24.200
<v Speaker 3>overseas and attempt to avoid being left</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a large stock of a drug that was no</v>

573
00:23:24.201 --> 00:23:26.150
<v Speaker 3>longer marketable in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

574
00:23:26.151 --> 00:23:28.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they also did with that aids</v>

575
00:23:28.281 --> 00:23:29.400
<v Speaker 3>medication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

576
00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:32.530
<v Speaker 3>what does that stuff that was fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>killing everybody act,</v>

577
00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:33.433
<v Speaker 3>act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

578
00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:36.260
<v Speaker 3>act was initially a chemotherapy</v>
<v Speaker 3>medication,</v>

579
00:23:36.261 --> 00:23:39.060
<v Speaker 3>but it was killing cancer patients</v>
<v Speaker 3>quicker than the cancer was.</v>

580
00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.460
<v Speaker 2>And they push that through because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>aids epidemic was so huge.</v>

581
00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:46.190
<v Speaker 2>They pushed that through so fast and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they knew it wasn't</v>

582
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:48.350
<v Speaker 1>working and they kept pushing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing,</v>

583
00:23:48.351 --> 00:23:49.700
<v Speaker 1>pushing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just not working.</v>

584
00:23:49.701 --> 00:23:50.870
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking killing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

585
00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:52.420
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

586
00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:56.450
<v Speaker 1>they used to call hades the gay cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they thought it was at one</v>

587
00:23:56.451 --> 00:23:57.770
<v Speaker 1>point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

588
00:23:57.771 --> 00:24:02.670
<v Speaker 1>it's the whole thing is just disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so terrifying when you think of a</v>

589
00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:07.680
<v Speaker 1>company that's valuing money in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at such a high level that they're</v>

590
00:24:08.241 --> 00:24:12.050
<v Speaker 1>willing to do something like that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>ship this tainted drugs to these other</v>

591
00:24:12.051 --> 00:24:13.190
<v Speaker 1>kinds of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know these people.</v>

592
00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.480
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just send it over there.</v>

593
00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:16.950
<v Speaker 1>Fuck France.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

594
00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:18.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

595
00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:21.620
<v Speaker 1>And they're still in business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is they market.</v>

596
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:25.400
<v Speaker 1>They market to the doctors so much that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put,</v>

597
00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:29.510
<v Speaker 1>they spend like $5 million on marketing</v>
<v Speaker 1>us and like 25 billion marketing to the</v>

598
00:24:29.511 --> 00:24:32.090
<v Speaker 1>doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're telling the doctors that to</v>

599
00:24:32.091 --> 00:24:35.270
<v Speaker 1>like push these drugs and push these</v>
<v Speaker 1>treats treatments on people.</v>

600
00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:37.370
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at the statistics of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Medicare,</v>

601
00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:42.080
<v Speaker 1>there's like 30,000 people every year</v>
<v Speaker 1>that die from treatments that they</v>

602
00:24:42.081 --> 00:24:44.000
<v Speaker 1>didn't even need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a fact.</v>

603
00:24:44.001 --> 00:24:46.160
<v Speaker 1>That's like a medicare fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like why are we,</v>

604
00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:48.500
<v Speaker 1>how are we giving people medicine that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't need?</v>

605
00:24:48.501 --> 00:24:49.910
<v Speaker 1>It's killing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes no sense.</v>

606
00:24:49.911 --> 00:24:50.744
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

607
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:54.530
<v Speaker 1>it's all because of money and they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really know what the medicines will do</v>

608
00:24:54.531 --> 00:24:55.970
<v Speaker 1>to people and they just keep giving it</v>
<v Speaker 1>given,</v>

609
00:24:55.971 --> 00:24:57.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given how harmful are some of the other</v>

610
00:24:57.441 --> 00:24:59.120
<v Speaker 1>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the restless leg syndrome.</v>

611
00:24:59.121 --> 00:25:03.170
<v Speaker 1>And like I saw one the other day that</v>
<v Speaker 1>said they have a medication for if you</v>

612
00:25:03.171 --> 00:25:05.510
<v Speaker 1>laugh too much or if he cries too much</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>

613
00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:09.560
<v Speaker 1>But it gave me that she smoked pot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take this truck,</v>

614
00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:13.370
<v Speaker 1>they restless leg syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that bullshit?</v>

615
00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:17.090
<v Speaker 1>Like what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually have a experience that</v>

616
00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.960
<v Speaker 1>because I've had like surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have like a weird circulation things</v>

617
00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:23.330
<v Speaker 1>what I feel is right when they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

618
00:25:23.331 --> 00:25:27.320
<v Speaker 1>what happens is like it's on days I had</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much caffeine or too much sugar.</v>

619
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:29.120
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel it's like something that's like</v>

620
00:25:29.121 --> 00:25:30.740
<v Speaker 1>self induced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

621
00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:34.040
<v Speaker 1>it actually is something that is rare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

622
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:37.040
<v Speaker 1>it's very rare but it's something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they advertise and you know,</v>

623
00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:41.660
<v Speaker 1>so it only would happen if there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>external things involved for me.</v>

624
00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

625
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:43.183
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

626
00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:45.740
<v Speaker 1>if it's completely like surgeries and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

627
00:25:45.741 --> 00:25:47.660
<v Speaker 1>And here's the thing though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of things aren't completely a</v>

628
00:25:47.661 --> 00:25:48.650
<v Speaker 1>myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of things.</v>

629
00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.040
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a fact like point zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>

630
00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:53.300
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one percent of the population go,</v>

631
00:25:53.301 --> 00:25:55.310
<v Speaker 1>how do I get that to effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

632
00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:56.720
<v Speaker 1>30 percent of the population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

633
00:25:56.721 --> 00:25:59.940
<v Speaker 1>I advertise the shit out of it and make</v>
<v Speaker 1>people feel like they have restless leg</v>

634
00:25:59.941 --> 00:26:01.580
<v Speaker 1>syndrome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll get all the caffeine addicts.</v>

635
00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.280
<v Speaker 1>He'll get all the sugar addicts and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

636
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:04.620
<v Speaker 1>let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

637
00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:06.050
<v Speaker 1>It's marketed to those people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

638
00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:07.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another thing that's really</v>

639
00:26:07.461 --> 00:26:11.480
<v Speaker 1>controversial that you touched on in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your documentary that I think is a</v>

640
00:26:11.481 --> 00:26:12.890
<v Speaker 1>really important thing to discuss.</v>

641
00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:14.720
<v Speaker 1>His depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

642
00:26:14.721 --> 00:26:16.790
<v Speaker 1>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression is a big one,</v>

643
00:26:16.791 --> 00:26:19.490
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big one because it's so hard to</v>

644
00:26:19.491 --> 00:26:21.690
<v Speaker 1>lock down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not this is a.</v>

645
00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:26.990
<v Speaker 1>is it a medical condition or is it just</v>
<v Speaker 1>a state of your life right now?</v>

646
00:26:26.991 --> 00:26:31.991
<v Speaker 1>Is it you reacting to all the doctor</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself to really hard as a friend going</v>

647
00:26:33.681 --> 00:26:36.560
<v Speaker 1>through rehab and I feel great and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn on like,</v>

648
00:26:36.561 --> 00:26:37.630
<v Speaker 1>how do you feel buddy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

649
00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to help these people too and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all helping each other.</v>

650
00:26:40.161 --> 00:26:41.030
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like so good.</v>

651
00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:43.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm depressed about what we're,</v>

652
00:26:43.191 --> 00:26:44.110
<v Speaker 1>we're in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in,</v>

653
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:44.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

654
00:26:44.971 --> 00:26:48.300
<v Speaker 1>in Malibu or in a beautiful place and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just depressed and you don't,</v>

655
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:52.020
<v Speaker 1>you can't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's something that we just</v>

656
00:26:52.021 --> 00:26:55.110
<v Speaker 1>don't know enough enough about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough how to treat it and I think we</v>

657
00:26:55.111 --> 00:26:59.130
<v Speaker 1>treated with pills that make you a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zombie so you just don't feel it and we</v>

658
00:26:59.131 --> 00:27:00.870
<v Speaker 1>never faced stuff that causes more</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression.</v>

659
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Even like alcohol and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also all sorts of other factors</v>

660
00:27:03.961 --> 00:27:06.360
<v Speaker 1>involved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what are you doing with your life?</v>

661
00:27:06.361 --> 00:27:08.640
<v Speaker 1>Like how much of your life is spent</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing productive,</v>

662
00:27:08.641 --> 00:27:10.860
<v Speaker 1>enjoyable things will kind of support</v>
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>

663
00:27:10.861 --> 00:27:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Do you have as far as your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are your friends like really happy,</v>

664
00:27:14.491 --> 00:27:17.460
<v Speaker 1>really healthy people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you engaging in a lot of physical</v>

665
00:27:17.461 --> 00:27:19.290
<v Speaker 1>activity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you eating healthy?</v>

666
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:21.720
<v Speaker 1>Are you getting enough rest?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you drinking enough water?</v>

667
00:27:21.721 --> 00:27:24.080
<v Speaker 1>All those things are a big factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huge.</v>

668
00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:26.580
<v Speaker 1>You are you doing what you want to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your life?</v>

669
00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:30.540
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to explain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend that has an awesome</v>

670
00:27:30.541 --> 00:27:32.310
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a ton of money.</v>

671
00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:37.350
<v Speaker 1>He's got everything that you could see</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the outside that we might want as a</v>

672
00:27:37.351 --> 00:27:38.021
<v Speaker 1>human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

00:27:38.021 --> 00:27:38.851
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really cool.</v>

674
00:27:38.851 --> 00:27:40.320
<v Speaker 1>He's got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can do whatever he wants.</v>

675
00:27:40.321 --> 00:27:42.360
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful Wife,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but he's depressed and I'm like,</v>

677
00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:46.920
<v Speaker 1>well I have no idea how to help that.</v>

678
00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:48.120
<v Speaker 1>Like zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

679
00:27:48.121 --> 00:27:50.400
<v Speaker 1>other than like he needs to go see a</v>
<v Speaker 1>therapist.</v>

680
00:27:50.401 --> 00:27:53.610
<v Speaker 1>That's like Kinda the only way that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can treat it because I think like us as</v>

681
00:27:53.611 --> 00:27:55.350
<v Speaker 1>friends don't just don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

682
00:27:55.351 --> 00:27:58.500
<v Speaker 1>I think there's no one answer that works</v>
<v Speaker 1>with everybody.</v>

683
00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:01.770
<v Speaker 1>Some people really suffer with any sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of balance,</v>

684
00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.590
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes people get these extreme highs</v>

685
00:28:04.591 --> 00:28:06.960
<v Speaker 1>and extreme lows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's hard for them to like ride it</v>

686
00:28:06.961 --> 00:28:08.610
<v Speaker 1>out in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've heard before,</v>

687
00:28:08.611 --> 00:28:10.880
<v Speaker 1>we're like from our friends at like</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestle a,</v>

688
00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:12.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they'll get this huge high,</v>

689
00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:15.330
<v Speaker 1>much like yourself going out in front of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big audience can be all fucking fired</v>

690
00:28:15.331 --> 00:28:17.400
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be funny as hell and then you got to go</v>

691
00:28:17.401 --> 00:28:19.170
<v Speaker 1>home and your wife's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't take out the garbage,</v>

692
00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.470
<v Speaker 1>like hard to go back to being a dad and</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a normal,</v>

693
00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:25.650
<v Speaker 1>a normal role in the household because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no like fans cheering for you.</v>

694
00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:29.150
<v Speaker 1>So I think a lot of those guys were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ups and downs are so wild,</v>

695
00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:31.170
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also,</v>

696
00:28:31.171 --> 00:28:31.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

697
00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:34.890
<v Speaker 1>it makes it 10 times worse because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing a lot of drugs,</v>

698
00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:37.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the highs and lows or even amplified</v>

699
00:28:37.861 --> 00:28:39.270
<v Speaker 1>even more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

700
00:28:39.271 --> 00:28:42.450
<v Speaker 1>but there's also a lot of trauma going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on with their body and their brain.</v>

701
00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:45.840
<v Speaker 1>I think that plays a giant factor and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>really do.</v>

702
00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:50.100
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of people that have had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of physical trauma and they have</v>

703
00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.740
<v Speaker 1>almost all of them have a hard time with</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression.</v>

704
00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:54.810
<v Speaker 1>But being happy as a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

705
00:28:54.811 --> 00:28:56.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he and I talk about this kind of stuff</v>

706
00:28:56.551 --> 00:29:00.270
<v Speaker 1>all the time and I've seen people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have their fucking legs blown off or</v>

707
00:29:00.271 --> 00:29:02.700
<v Speaker 1>more and they got the biggest fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>smile on their face.</v>

708
00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:05.760
<v Speaker 1>We've seen some people in some pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty situations I have.</v>

709
00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:07.860
<v Speaker 1>He has a guide as Jim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This Guy Bryce.</v>

710
00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:10.140
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to figure out how to dead</v>
<v Speaker 1>lift with one leg.</v>

711
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:13.540
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have a prosthetic leg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to figure out a deadlift any</v>

712
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:14.800
<v Speaker 1>days all the way up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

713
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:16.460
<v Speaker 1>He's all the way up by the hip so he</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't.</v>

714
00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:18.680
<v Speaker 1>A prosthetic can kind of work but not</v>
<v Speaker 1>really know,</v>

715
00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:21.270
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've seen people in all kinds of shitty</v>

716
00:29:21.271 --> 00:29:24.270
<v Speaker 1>situations and they still got to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're still fucking smile and they're</v>

717
00:29:24.271 --> 00:29:28.440
<v Speaker 1>still finding other things to live for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's lifting weights or doing,</v>

718
00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking climbing rocks or whatever the</v>

719
00:29:30.631 --> 00:29:32.680
<v Speaker 1>hell it is they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does she,</v>

720
00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:34.320
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing some productive shit.</v>

721
00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:36.840
<v Speaker 1>Pursuing enjoyable activities is a big</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

722
00:29:36.841 --> 00:29:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Pursuing something that you really have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a passion for,</v>

723
00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:42.520
<v Speaker 1>like as a career is another big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of people that</v>

724
00:29:42.521 --> 00:29:46.900
<v Speaker 1>feel that soul sucking grind of day to</v>
<v Speaker 1>day nine to five doing something they</v>

725
00:29:46.901 --> 00:29:51.901
<v Speaker 1>hate is just unbelievably taxing as like</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a filmmaker.</v>

726
00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:55.840
<v Speaker 1>Every film I've done have done three of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them that I've directed and one of that</v>

727
00:29:55.841 --> 00:29:59.290
<v Speaker 1>I produced it every time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about raising the money and getting</v>

728
00:29:59.291 --> 00:30:03.580
<v Speaker 1>going and it's just so hard and it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would get depressed in between</v>

729
00:30:03.581 --> 00:30:05.490
<v Speaker 1>projects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'd have like these great highest,</v>

730
00:30:05.491 --> 00:30:06.131
<v Speaker 1>a bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger,</v>

731
00:30:06.131 --> 00:30:08.020
<v Speaker 1>faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Came out at Sundance Film Festival.</v>

732
00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:10.960
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's talking about is 96 percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>on rotten tomatoes.</v>

733
00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:13.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm up here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I got to go get money to make the</v>

734
00:30:13.511 --> 00:30:15.490
<v Speaker 1>next movie and I'm down here because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>broke.</v>

735
00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:17.500
<v Speaker 1>I have no money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't make a lot of money on these</v>

736
00:30:17.501 --> 00:30:22.210
<v Speaker 1>things and it's just an up and down</v>
<v Speaker 1>business and then at least you're doing</v>

737
00:30:22.211 --> 00:30:23.110
<v Speaker 1>it for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

738
00:30:23.111 --> 00:30:24.700
<v Speaker 1>And after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but after all of it,</v>

739
00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:26.860
<v Speaker 1>after all said and done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not about the money,</v>

740
00:30:26.861 --> 00:30:29.080
<v Speaker 1>it's about for me doing something</v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>

741
00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:31.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day I talked to my</v>

742
00:30:31.061 --> 00:30:34.020
<v Speaker 1>brother after I got sober and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what man?</v>

743
00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:36.640
<v Speaker 1>You're biggest problem is you don't need</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>

744
00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:39.400
<v Speaker 1>You've done it all yourself already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you need anybody?</v>

745
00:30:39.401 --> 00:30:42.490
<v Speaker 1>You don't need anybody to help you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep doing what you're doing and that's</v>

746
00:30:42.491 --> 00:30:44.860
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gave me so much confidence and</v>

747
00:30:44.861 --> 00:30:48.250
<v Speaker 1>empower yourself to empower yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>build confidence.</v>

748
00:30:48.251 --> 00:30:52.810
<v Speaker 1>Confidence is huge and in depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not depressed anymore.</v>

749
00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:55.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a project right now and</v>

750
00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:57.880
<v Speaker 1>money for practicing now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't care because it's like,</v>

751
00:30:58.330 --> 00:30:58.961
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll get it,</v>

752
00:30:58.961 --> 00:31:00.160
<v Speaker 1>we'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've done it before.</v>

753
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:02.260
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think that building your own</v>

754
00:31:02.261 --> 00:31:04.890
<v Speaker 1>confidence is big in getting over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression.</v>

755
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:07.120
<v Speaker 1>Got To be a certain amount of depression</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's allowed to,</v>

756
00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:08.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something terrible happens.</v>

757
00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:11.050
<v Speaker 1>You gotTa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta allow for some of that.</v>

758
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:13.330
<v Speaker 1>Allow for some of that to come in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to happen.</v>

759
00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.500
<v Speaker 1>Even not even terrible.</v>

760
00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.410
<v Speaker 1>Like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll fuck up one joke and a killer set</v>

761
00:31:17.411 --> 00:31:21.370
<v Speaker 1>where I get a standing ovation at one</v>
<v Speaker 1>joke will fuck my head up man.</v>

762
00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:23.850
<v Speaker 1>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just be driving home going,</v>

763
00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:26.090
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just,</v>

764
00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.570
<v Speaker 1>I'll sit at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go over that.</v>

765
00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:29.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about Ronda Rousey?</v>

766
00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:30.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the law,</v>

767
00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.880
<v Speaker 1>you know what she said on Ellen</v>
<v Speaker 1>degenerate.</v>

768
00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:36.070
<v Speaker 1>That to me that was the coolest fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that woman has ever done.</v>

769
00:31:36.071 --> 00:31:37.180
<v Speaker 1>That.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was really neat to me.</v>

770
00:31:37.181 --> 00:31:40.420
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm a huge fan of hers anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she's amazing,</v>

771
00:31:40.421 --> 00:31:43.390
<v Speaker 1>but that was fucking awesome to kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hear her.</v>

772
00:31:43.391 --> 00:31:44.860
<v Speaker 1>Just lay it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lay it all in a line.</v>

773
00:31:44.861 --> 00:31:46.840
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On top of that,</v>

774
00:31:46.841 --> 00:31:51.220
<v Speaker 1>there's also like head trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like that.</v>

775
00:31:51.221 --> 00:31:53.770
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just no way around it.</v>

776
00:31:53.771 --> 00:31:55.690
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just be the fact that she was the</v>

777
00:31:55.691 --> 00:32:00.691
<v Speaker 1>highest of highs as far as celebrity sco</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then she just gets shit on all over</v>

778
00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:01.990
<v Speaker 1>social media.</v>

779
00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:06.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean I read just a few of the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he sold people,</v>

780
00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.770
<v Speaker 1>all the memes and all the crazy shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people,</v>

781
00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:10.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're probably just not even thinking</v>

782
00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.640
<v Speaker 1>and we all have fun with different</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

783
00:32:12.641 --> 00:32:14.020
<v Speaker 1>but they're trying to be funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

784
00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:15.640
<v Speaker 1>trying to be funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to be clever,</v>

785
00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.350
<v Speaker 1>man can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't look at it if you're Rhonda.</v>

786
00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:23.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's also part of what comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>with being that huge</v>

787
00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:27.250
<v Speaker 1>project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcgregor kind of handled it.</v>

788
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:29.110
<v Speaker 1>I thought I saw on your instagram you</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

789
00:32:29.111 --> 00:32:30.820
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the best way that he handled it.</v>

790
00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:32.950
<v Speaker 1>Like a fucking man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went out there,</v>

791
00:32:32.951 --> 00:32:36.430
<v Speaker 1>he put a picture of him struggling with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nice suit on and he said,</v>

792
00:32:36.431 --> 00:32:38.870
<v Speaker 1>I went out there and I took a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will not apologize.</v>

793
00:32:38.871 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 1>It will stop being me.</v>

794
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.470
<v Speaker 3>And then he wrote Dosantos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are a pussy,</v>

795
00:32:42.471 --> 00:32:45.740
<v Speaker 3>although you are a pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That great.</v>

796
00:32:45.741 --> 00:32:46.910
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Back to talking to shit.</v>

797
00:32:46.911 --> 00:32:47.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

798
00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:50.420
<v Speaker 3>It's what made him and he said he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going right back to it,</v>

799
00:32:50.421 --> 00:32:52.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the thing is if he,</v>

800
00:32:52.541 --> 00:32:55.610
<v Speaker 3>if he loses more fights or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that might get worse and it might go</v>

801
00:32:55.611 --> 00:32:56.490
<v Speaker 3>away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if he,</v>

802
00:32:56.530 --> 00:32:57.890
<v Speaker 3>what if he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

803
00:32:57.891 --> 00:32:59.540
<v Speaker 3>you become a legend forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

804
00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:00.980
<v Speaker 3>so he can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll get better,</v>

805
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:03.190
<v Speaker 3>he'll get better and he'll learn and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

806
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:04.880
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's beside the point.</v>

807
00:33:04.881 --> 00:33:08.030
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm lowe's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>

808
00:33:08.031 --> 00:33:12.290
<v Speaker 3>are important because what a bad feeling</v>
<v Speaker 3>does for me,</v>

809
00:33:12.291 --> 00:33:15.110
<v Speaker 3>someone who's really hard on themselves</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they screw up one thing and it</v>

810
00:33:15.111 --> 00:33:18.890
<v Speaker 3>really drives me nuts that what that</v>
<v Speaker 3>does is that motivates me to be more</v>

811
00:33:18.891 --> 00:33:22.040
<v Speaker 3>focused and more intense and pay more</v>
<v Speaker 3>attention to what I'm doing.</v>

812
00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.130
<v Speaker 3>And if I don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will feel that same thing again,</v>

813
00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:27.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's like a certain amount of,</v>

814
00:33:27.831 --> 00:33:30.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like those bad feelings where things go</v>

815
00:33:30.501 --> 00:33:32.360
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just got to accept in your life,</v>

816
00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:33.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like breakups,</v>

817
00:33:33.561 --> 00:33:36.170
<v Speaker 3>breakups are devastating for people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

818
00:33:36.171 --> 00:33:40.340
<v Speaker 3>like when someone breaks up with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you feel like they stole a</v>

819
00:33:40.341 --> 00:33:43.120
<v Speaker 3>part of you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they stole some of your happiness.</v>

820
00:33:43.121 --> 00:33:45.410
<v Speaker 3>It's a huge investment to be in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship with somebody.</v>

821
00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:49.280
<v Speaker 3>But you got to realize when that's over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when that breakups over,</v>

822
00:33:49.281 --> 00:33:49.881
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

823
00:33:49.881 --> 00:33:53.090
<v Speaker 3>like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this gives you an opportunity to move on</v>

824
00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:56.740
<v Speaker 3>and to get your life in order better and</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

825
00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:00.100
<v Speaker 3>to look at yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give it to be by yourself for a while</v>

826
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:03.740
<v Speaker 3>and understand how much you value a</v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy relationship.</v>

827
00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:06.890
<v Speaker 3>He's had a lot of good ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad ones.</v>

828
00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:10.070
<v Speaker 3>He had a girl call him up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't date anymore because I have</v>

829
00:34:10.071 --> 00:34:14.120
<v Speaker 3>cancer by that set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was over and she actually have</v>

830
00:34:14.121 --> 00:34:16.910
<v Speaker 3>cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No big lie.</v>

831
00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:19.600
<v Speaker 3>It's part of this whole guys got nothing</v>
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

832
00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how is she going to get rid of,</v>

833
00:34:22.581 --> 00:34:24.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

834
00:34:24.621 --> 00:34:25.371
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what else can you say?</v>

835
00:34:25.371 --> 00:34:26.990
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just not fun.</v>

836
00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:28.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fat and ugly.</v>

837
00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:30.670
<v Speaker 3>You got a small Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

838
00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:34.280
<v Speaker 3>I guess I have cancer pie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that bad,</v>

839
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:35.150
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

840
00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:37.730
<v Speaker 3>those are important and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to be with that person</v>

841
00:34:37.731 --> 00:34:39.050
<v Speaker 3>anyway if that's how they feel about</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

842
00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:42.950
<v Speaker 3>You got to find the person that really</v>
<v Speaker 3>likes you or you gotta figure out how to</v>

843
00:34:42.951 --> 00:34:47.030
<v Speaker 3>become someone who people like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's part of the struggle of</v>

844
00:34:47.031 --> 00:34:50.330
<v Speaker 3>developing as a human being too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a Rut that some people never</v>

845
00:34:50.331 --> 00:34:50.840
<v Speaker 3>get out of.</v>

846
00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.390
<v Speaker 3>Some people they get into this Rut like</v>
<v Speaker 3>in high school,</v>

847
00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:56.660
<v Speaker 3>like in dating in high school and</v>
<v Speaker 3>college and they fucking never get out</v>

848
00:34:56.661 --> 00:34:57.890
<v Speaker 3>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're always in combative,</v>

849
00:34:57.891 --> 00:35:01.550
<v Speaker 3>shitty relationships forever and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>never pause and reset.</v>

850
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:04.880
<v Speaker 3>They never have like a relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rehab was a lot.</v>

851
00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:07.600
<v Speaker 3>It takes a lot of strength to walk away</v>
<v Speaker 3>from anything that you have invested</v>

852
00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:08.390
<v Speaker 3>time in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

853
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:10.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean even shitty relationships.</v>

854
00:35:10.461 --> 00:35:12.890
<v Speaker 3>At least they have familiarity to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

855
00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:13.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ronda Rousey,</v>

856
00:35:13.821 --> 00:35:15.170
<v Speaker 3>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm not this,</v>

857
00:35:15.171 --> 00:35:17.510
<v Speaker 3>then what am I like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me that was a huge statement.</v>

858
00:35:17.511 --> 00:35:19.280
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people are always,</v>

859
00:35:19.281 --> 00:35:21.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being defined by other people.</v>

860
00:35:21.441 --> 00:35:23.900
<v Speaker 3>You got to be defined by yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got to come,</v>

861
00:35:23.901 --> 00:35:26.930
<v Speaker 3>it's got to come internally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be hard for her because she</v>

862
00:35:26.931 --> 00:35:28.800
<v Speaker 3>is such a mega star and she is known as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fighter.</v>

863
00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:29.510
<v Speaker 3>She knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

864
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:32.330
<v Speaker 3>the most dominant female fighter of all</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

865
00:35:32.331 --> 00:35:35.690
<v Speaker 3>So it's got to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's also like that kind of success,</v>

866
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:39.300
<v Speaker 3>like that kind of love and notoriety is</v>
<v Speaker 3>so unnatural.</v>

867
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:42.570
<v Speaker 3>So that high is so unnatural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's strange.</v>

868
00:35:42.571 --> 00:35:44.890
<v Speaker 3>It's like almost like the Oxycontin of</v>
<v Speaker 3>achievement.</v>

869
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:50.520
<v Speaker 3>You when you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're achieving something athletically.</v>

870
00:35:50.521 --> 00:35:53.420
<v Speaker 3>It's not as simple as like say like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bench coach.</v>

871
00:35:53.421 --> 00:35:53.971
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fight,</v>

872
00:35:53.971 --> 00:35:56.550
<v Speaker 3>which was probably like her highlight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She goes down to Brazil,</v>

873
00:35:56.551 --> 00:35:58.200
<v Speaker 3>she gets cheered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she fights his girl,</v>

874
00:35:58.201 --> 00:36:01.170
<v Speaker 3>knocks her out in the first round,</v>
<v Speaker 3>struts around like a peacock.</v>

875
00:36:01.171 --> 00:36:03.660
<v Speaker 3>The whole world's cheering for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's on top of the world.</v>

876
00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:04.840
<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

877
00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:08.430
<v Speaker 3>what actually really happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would actually really happen was</v>

878
00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:13.680
<v Speaker 3>there's two people and they're engaging</v>
<v Speaker 3>in an activity and one person is better</v>

879
00:36:13.681 --> 00:36:18.681
<v Speaker 3>at that activity and the other person</v>
<v Speaker 3>and only better by a hair or a margin</v>

880
00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:19.680
<v Speaker 3>like this.</v>

881
00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:23.970
<v Speaker 3>One person is more of a brawler and</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's much more nervous and she makes</v>

882
00:36:23.971 --> 00:36:27.630
<v Speaker 3>mistakes and then the other person is</v>
<v Speaker 3>better under pressure and she connects</v>

883
00:36:27.631 --> 00:36:30.810
<v Speaker 3>with better shots and then the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>person gets hit on the button and it</v>

884
00:36:30.811 --> 00:36:35.811
<v Speaker 3>goes down like the actual actual events</v>
<v Speaker 3>of what happened or not.</v>

885
00:36:35.881 --> 00:36:39.630
<v Speaker 3>That big of a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it happens in gyms all across the</v>

886
00:36:39.631 --> 00:36:41.490
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the fact that it's on this big</v>

887
00:36:41.491 --> 00:36:44.280
<v Speaker 3>stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that so many eyes are on that</v>

888
00:36:44.281 --> 00:36:47.130
<v Speaker 3>moment gets magnified so the result gets</v>
<v Speaker 3>magnified,</v>

889
00:36:47.131 --> 00:36:51.630
<v Speaker 3>so it becomes this really unnatural</v>
<v Speaker 3>state where everybody loves you for this</v>

890
00:36:51.631 --> 00:36:55.430
<v Speaker 3>brief moment and you're walking around</v>
<v Speaker 3>glory,</v>

891
00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:59.970
<v Speaker 3>glory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The glory also comes with the potential.</v>

892
00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:03.690
<v Speaker 3>Any high comes with the potential of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>corresponding low.</v>

893
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:06.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's just no way around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's exactly.</v>

894
00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.910
<v Speaker 3>It's exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing that killed our brother was</v>

895
00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:12.210
<v Speaker 3>was that he constantly wanted to be in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wwe,</v>

896
00:37:12.211 --> 00:37:15.480
<v Speaker 3>constantly wanted to be something and</v>
<v Speaker 3>when people told him like,</v>

897
00:37:15.481 --> 00:37:16.410
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

898
00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.900
<v Speaker 3>you're getting too old for this or</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not in shape enough for this.</v>

899
00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:20.960
<v Speaker 3>Like he couldn't really handle that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

900
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.590
<v Speaker 3>That was a big part of his depression</v>
<v Speaker 3>was he was trying to be defined by this,</v>

901
00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:30.680
<v Speaker 3>a wrestling league that only gives very</v>
<v Speaker 3>few people a shot and those people have</v>

902
00:37:31.411 --> 00:37:35.160
<v Speaker 3>either really earned it or they knew</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody or whatever and got in and he</v>

903
00:37:35.161 --> 00:37:38.310
<v Speaker 3>was always trying to get to that and my</v>
<v Speaker 3>dad says,</v>

904
00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:40.150
<v Speaker 3>even if you did get to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he,</v>

905
00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:42.500
<v Speaker 3>he still would've went the same way</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he wouldn't.</v>

906
00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:44.970
<v Speaker 3>He would have went the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've been like crazy because he had</v>

907
00:37:44.971 --> 00:37:46.590
<v Speaker 3>money and he had fame and whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

908
00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.480
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times it's the way you look at</v>

909
00:37:48.481 --> 00:37:50.520
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the parameters that you set for</v>

910
00:37:50.521 --> 00:37:53.100
<v Speaker 3>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If those parameters are fucked up,</v>

911
00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:56.640
<v Speaker 3>it's going to make your life fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter what you get involved in.</v>

912
00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.260
<v Speaker 3>And that's something that you find with</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people,</v>

913
00:37:58.261 --> 00:38:00.420
<v Speaker 3>some people that are happy and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>become successful,</v>

914
00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:03.630
<v Speaker 3>they can be happy and successful in</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty much everything they do.</v>

915
00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:07.980
<v Speaker 3>They have good parameters that they've</v>
<v Speaker 3>set up good behavior patterns and in the</v>

916
00:38:07.981 --> 00:38:11.670
<v Speaker 3>people that have bad behavior patterns</v>
<v Speaker 3>are self destructive behavior patterns.</v>

917
00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:13.830
<v Speaker 3>Those things repeat themselves over and</v>
<v Speaker 3>over again.</v>

918
00:38:13.831 --> 00:38:17.220
<v Speaker 3>Even when they get on a roll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I have friends that I know they get</v>

919
00:38:17.221 --> 00:38:18.110
<v Speaker 3>on a roll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

920
00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:20.460
<v Speaker 3>everything's going good but I know</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to fuck up.</v>

921
00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:23.370
<v Speaker 3>It's just a matter of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then one day you'll see them and</v>

922
00:38:23.371 --> 00:38:25.400
<v Speaker 3>they're drinking again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I thought you quit drinking,</v>

923
00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:26.643
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

<v Speaker 3>running out.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I want to hear it and I check your urine</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a business or comedy.</v>

926
00:38:34.801 --> 00:38:37.270
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people are kind of like that.</v>

927
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:40.210
<v Speaker 3>I like Kinda kinda miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kind of like that's why they,</v>

928
00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:42.440
<v Speaker 3>they make fun of things because I to</v>
<v Speaker 3>deal with that,</v>

929
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:45.460
<v Speaker 3>like kind of avoid maybe hanging out</v>
<v Speaker 3>with some of those people are.</v>

930
00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:47.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friends are all pretty happy.</v>

931
00:38:47.141 --> 00:38:48.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had friends that have had problems</v>

932
00:38:48.881 --> 00:38:50.890
<v Speaker 3>with depression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have helped some friends that had</v>

933
00:38:50.891 --> 00:38:52.750
<v Speaker 3>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a buddy who got depressed because</v>

934
00:38:52.751 --> 00:38:56.440
<v Speaker 3>he was taking propecia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something you should be concerned with</v>

935
00:38:56.441 --> 00:38:58.180
<v Speaker 3>folks if you're losing your hair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

936
00:38:58.181 --> 00:38:59.860
<v Speaker 3>shaved your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's greatest thing I ever did.</v>

937
00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.270
<v Speaker 3>I love and had said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

938
00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:02.380
<v Speaker 3>it's glorious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

939
00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:05.110
<v Speaker 3>I feel like anybody who won't fuck you</v>
<v Speaker 3>because your head shaved.</v>

940
00:39:05.111 --> 00:39:06.840
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't want to fuck them anyway</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're awake.</v>

941
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.830
<v Speaker 3>You're barely getting them to fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get in there,</v>

942
00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't like you that much.</v>

943
00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:14.230
<v Speaker 3>They only fuck you because you have the</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

944
00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:18.700
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my friend was taken propecia and he</v>

945
00:39:18.701 --> 00:39:22.690
<v Speaker 3>was getting seriously depressed and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't connect the two of them together</v>

946
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:25.500
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got him to a psychiatrist and helped</v>

947
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:26.950
<v Speaker 3>him out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he actually was.</v>

948
00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:31.570
<v Speaker 3>He benefited from psych drugs because</v>
<v Speaker 3>those psych drugs got him happy and</v>

949
00:39:31.571 --> 00:39:34.990
<v Speaker 3>weaned him off and got him on on point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God is life in order.</v>

950
00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:37.900
<v Speaker 3>And then once his life got an order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he weaned himself off those things.</v>

951
00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:40.250
<v Speaker 3>And it's also the right way to use them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

952
00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:42.010
<v Speaker 3>You're not the press forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

953
00:39:42.011 --> 00:39:44.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he also got off that fucking piece of</v>

954
00:39:44.201 --> 00:39:45.640
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not for everybody.</v>

955
00:39:45.641 --> 00:39:47.290
<v Speaker 3>I took her patient for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't,</v>

956
00:39:47.291 --> 00:39:49.380
<v Speaker 3>didn't make me depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of people that makes them</v>

957
00:39:49.381 --> 00:39:50.050
<v Speaker 3>impotent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

958
00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:50.950
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he definitely did.</v>

959
00:39:50.951 --> 00:39:52.900
<v Speaker 3>That didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't kill my Dick,</v>

960
00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:54.190
<v Speaker 3>but it beat the shit out of it.</v>

961
00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:55.023
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's</v>

962
00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:00.733
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

963
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:03.100
<v Speaker 3>you will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't keep you from getting it up,</v>

964
00:40:03.101 --> 00:40:05.860
<v Speaker 3>but it's definitely not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't even realize it was her</v>

965
00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:10.920
<v Speaker 3>pubes big and your dick smaller now my</v>
<v Speaker 3>prescription ran out and I was like,</v>

966
00:40:12.011 --> 00:40:13.450
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to get to the doctor and refill</v>

967
00:40:13.451 --> 00:40:16.180
<v Speaker 3>my prescription.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden I've got this raging</v>

968
00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:17.410
<v Speaker 3>boner all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

969
00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:19.620
<v Speaker 3>what's going on down here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I.</v>

970
00:40:19.621 --> 00:40:20.920
<v Speaker 3>and then I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

971
00:40:20.921 --> 00:40:23.590
<v Speaker 3>it's the propecia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is what my dick supposed to be</v>

972
00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:26.440
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ridiculous getting off.</v>

973
00:40:26.441 --> 00:40:31.441
<v Speaker 3>This shit had went out and bought quit</v>
<v Speaker 3>propecia long before I shaved my head.</v>

974
00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:33.460
<v Speaker 3>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

975
00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:36.760
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that my friend going through that was</v>

976
00:40:36.761 --> 00:40:39.200
<v Speaker 3>really scary because he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

977
00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:41.440
<v Speaker 3>he was really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really depressed and it was like,</v>

978
00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:44.470
<v Speaker 3>I was like shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I got to figure out a way to help</v>

979
00:40:44.471 --> 00:40:46.690
<v Speaker 3>this guy because this is not who we</v>
<v Speaker 3>normally is.</v>

980
00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:49.000
<v Speaker 3>Normally he would be like happy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>joking.</v>

981
00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:54.120
<v Speaker 3>Like comics are all kind of fucked up in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a way and that are performers.</v>

982
00:40:54.791 --> 00:40:56.650
<v Speaker 3>They see things fucked up in the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Usually.</v>

983
00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.890
<v Speaker 3>Usually when you're getting on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason why you do it in the first</v>

984
00:40:59.891 --> 00:41:02.920
<v Speaker 3>place is you're compensating for</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that's missing,</v>

985
00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:07.270
<v Speaker 3>like a lack of attention you got when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were young or lack of self esteem</v>

986
00:41:07.271 --> 00:41:10.810
<v Speaker 3>and you're trying to make up for it by</v>
<v Speaker 3>your performances on stage and you're</v>

987
00:41:10.811 --> 00:41:14.590
<v Speaker 3>trying to get the audience to like you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like almost like a hustle in a way.</v>

988
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:17.650
<v Speaker 3>And the reward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can come up with jokes and</v>

989
00:41:17.651 --> 00:41:20.330
<v Speaker 3>routines that are good enough to get the</v>
<v Speaker 3>people to the lab,</v>

990
00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:23.170
<v Speaker 3>you get them to feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then that becomes your new self</v>

991
00:41:23.171 --> 00:41:25.540
<v Speaker 3>esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just said it's a real tricky trap.</v>

992
00:41:25.541 --> 00:41:27.760
<v Speaker 3>Do you think for yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

993
00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:29.930
<v Speaker 3>you don't really fit the mold or do.</v>

994
00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:33.680
<v Speaker 3>I definitely don't fit all the molds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I fit some of the molds,</v>

995
00:41:33.681 --> 00:41:35.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the same mold that got me into</v>

996
00:41:35.781 --> 00:41:39.530
<v Speaker 3>martial arts was the same mold that got</v>
<v Speaker 3>me into comedy in the mold that got me</v>

997
00:41:39.531 --> 00:41:42.800
<v Speaker 3>into martial arts was feeling like I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>a loser,</v>

998
00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:47.180
<v Speaker 3>feeling like nobody gave a shit about me</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that everybody doubted me and then I</v>

999
00:41:47.181 --> 00:41:51.020
<v Speaker 3>just didn't have anybody to count on and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was always worried about getting my</v>

1000
00:41:51.021 --> 00:41:51.831
<v Speaker 3>ass kicked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1001
00:41:51.831 --> 00:41:53.840
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to figure out how to fight.</v>

1002
00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:55.810
<v Speaker 3>And I wasn't a big guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1003
00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:59.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm only five eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I was just like short kid and you</v>

1004
00:41:59.091 --> 00:42:00.550
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in high school like when I started was</v>

1005
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.790
<v Speaker 3>even shorter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was like,</v>

1006
00:42:01.791 --> 00:42:03.500
<v Speaker 3>fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to learn how to fight.</v>

1007
00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:07.130
<v Speaker 3>And I just was tired of feeling scared,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was the same thing.</v>

1008
00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:10.550
<v Speaker 3>It was like I was looking for something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I was good at to boost up my self</v>

1009
00:42:10.551 --> 00:42:13.370
<v Speaker 3>esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How has the short kid and you know,</v>

1010
00:42:13.371 --> 00:42:16.720
<v Speaker 3>lifting for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I bench pressed three slash 15 in</v>

1011
00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:20.510
<v Speaker 3>11th grade and then four or five by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time I was a senior and I was blowing</v>

1012
00:42:20.511 --> 00:42:23.150
<v Speaker 3>people away and the same with mark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He benched 300,</v>

1013
00:42:23.151 --> 00:42:26.880
<v Speaker 3>15 pounds in ninth grade and he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>dyslexic or learning disabled.</v>

1014
00:42:26.890 --> 00:42:28.770
<v Speaker 3>All these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that gave us confidence.</v>

1015
00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:31.120
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes the deficits that you,</v>

1016
00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:34.280
<v Speaker 3>you achieve and or that you experienced</v>
<v Speaker 3>in life,</v>

1017
00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:36.500
<v Speaker 3>they can help you if you can get through</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1018
00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:39.230
<v Speaker 3>If you can get over that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can get over those humps,</v>

1019
00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:43.730
<v Speaker 3>they can give you motivation and fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why kids that are born rich and</v>

1020
00:42:43.731 --> 00:42:47.210
<v Speaker 3>privileged and live in a big ass house</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they get everything they want.</v>

1021
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:51.530
<v Speaker 3>They very rarely have the drive to</v>
<v Speaker 3>accomplish great things because a lot of</v>

1022
00:42:51.531 --> 00:42:56.270
<v Speaker 3>times that drive comes from that feeling</v>
<v Speaker 3>of poverty or that feeling of loss or</v>

1023
00:42:56.271 --> 00:43:00.920
<v Speaker 3>that feeling of just being lonely and</v>
<v Speaker 3>depressed and like you get motivated to</v>

1024
00:43:00.921 --> 00:43:03.190
<v Speaker 3>go out there and make your mark like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>film.</v>

1025
00:43:03.191 --> 00:43:04.310
<v Speaker 3>He did a trophy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kids,</v>

1026
00:43:04.311 --> 00:43:05.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's a,</v>

1027
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:07.040
<v Speaker 3>all these kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

1028
00:43:07.041 --> 00:43:09.500
<v Speaker 3>these parents paying thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars for these kids who go to these</v>

1029
00:43:09.501 --> 00:43:13.010
<v Speaker 3>special camps and stuff like that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best athletes in the world had their</v>

1030
00:43:13.011 --> 00:43:15.200
<v Speaker 3>parents just take a hike on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm usually or die.</v>

1031
00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:16.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the other,</v>

1032
00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:19.040
<v Speaker 3>or sometimes there's divorced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mark was coaching football.</v>

1033
00:43:19.041 --> 00:43:21.770
<v Speaker 3>One time I'll never forget this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a parent came to him and said,</v>

1034
00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:23.960
<v Speaker 3>how do I make my kid great at football?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

1035
00:43:23.961 --> 00:43:25.560
<v Speaker 3>drop them off in the ghetto.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>some.</v>

1039
00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:34.130
<v Speaker 3>My kids got to be angry and then also</v>
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>

1040
00:43:34.131 --> 00:43:39.131
<v Speaker 3>like you know when someone's coming to</v>
<v Speaker 3>you at like 16 or 17 years old and</v>

<v Speaker 3>We would've known that 17.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>

1047
00:43:52.461 --> 00:43:55.820
<v Speaker 3>And he just stands out all the time on</v>
<v Speaker 3>every one of my wife's friends has a</v>

1048
00:43:55.821 --> 00:43:58.790
<v Speaker 3>five year old son in this little</v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker.</v>

1049
00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:01.640
<v Speaker 3>I pulled her aside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he takes martial arts and I pulled her</v>

1050
00:44:01.641 --> 00:44:03.200
<v Speaker 3>aside and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kid is an athlete.</v>

1051
00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:06.680
<v Speaker 3>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he knows how to use his body.</v>

1052
00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:09.770
<v Speaker 3>Like if he stays with us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he's really interested in this,</v>

1053
00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:13.520
<v Speaker 3>he's going to be a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you could tell that that's crazy</v>

1054
00:44:13.521 --> 00:44:16.550
<v Speaker 3>five the way he does cartwheels way</v>
<v Speaker 3>balances himself.</v>

1055
00:44:16.551 --> 00:44:19.490
<v Speaker 3>The way he can shift shift positions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1056
00:44:19.491 --> 00:44:21.800
<v Speaker 3>if I had that little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I could coach that little kid,</v>

1057
00:44:21.801 --> 00:44:23.710
<v Speaker 3>I could make them a motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You listen,</v>

1058
00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:27.950
<v Speaker 3>that's what happened with trophy kids is</v>
<v Speaker 3>it all starts with good intentions.</v>

1059
00:44:27.951 --> 00:44:29.910
<v Speaker 3>Like you get excited about this</v>
<v Speaker 3>five-year-old.</v>

1060
00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:30.560
<v Speaker 3>But what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1061
00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:31.101
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1062
00:44:31.101 --> 00:44:32.130
<v Speaker 3>what about when he's eight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he says,</v>

1063
00:44:32.131 --> 00:44:32.964
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

1064
00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:35.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do Jujitsu anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do martial arts center.</v>

1065
00:44:35.501 --> 00:44:38.280
<v Speaker 3>Then you gotta let them go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let them go is right.</v>

1066
00:44:38.281 --> 00:44:39.750
<v Speaker 3>But then a lot of parents don't let them</v>
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>

1067
00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:41.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But those people are crazy.</v>

1068
00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:42.630
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why it's good you did that</v>

1069
00:44:42.631 --> 00:44:43.270
<v Speaker 3>documentary.</v>

1070
00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:44.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those people are crazy.</v>

1071
00:44:44.461 --> 00:44:46.770
<v Speaker 3>You got cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That kid might be an awesome guitarist.</v>

1072
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.370
<v Speaker 3>He might give up on Jujitsu and become</v>
<v Speaker 3>this amazing musician.</v>

1073
00:44:50.371 --> 00:44:54.390
<v Speaker 3>He might become a writer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He might just decide that he loves</v>

1074
00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:57.800
<v Speaker 3>exercise just for fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what he really enjoys doing is</v>

1075
00:44:58.110 --> 00:45:00.480
<v Speaker 3>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wants to be a doctor who the fuck</v>

1076
00:45:00.481 --> 00:45:03.630
<v Speaker 3>knows you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no one knows that there's so many</v>

1077
00:45:03.631 --> 00:45:06.420
<v Speaker 3>different people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to figure out what it is in</v>

1078
00:45:06.421 --> 00:45:09.840
<v Speaker 3>you that you like to express with what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do for a living.</v>

1079
00:45:09.841 --> 00:45:11.190
<v Speaker 3>If you could figure that out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1080
00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:15.120
<v Speaker 3>That is the fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can find something you enjoy</v>

1081
00:45:15.121 --> 00:45:16.440
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is the thing.</v>

1082
00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:19.170
<v Speaker 3>I always thought I want them to be in</v>
<v Speaker 3>front of the camera.</v>

1083
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:22.920
<v Speaker 3>I just thought I wanted to be an actor</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I do whatever and I was always short</v>

1084
00:45:22.921 --> 00:45:24.240
<v Speaker 3>and fat and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1085
00:45:24.241 --> 00:45:24.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

1086
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:27.000
<v Speaker 3>That's not gonna happen unless I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got It.</v>

1087
00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:29.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so my Alfred Hitchcock was in front of</v>

1088
00:45:29.971 --> 00:45:31.140
<v Speaker 3>the camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't that pretty.</v>

1089
00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:34.590
<v Speaker 3>When you're in front of the camera to</v>
<v Speaker 3>document and somewhat and,</v>

1090
00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:37.350
<v Speaker 3>and that kind of happened by accident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't trying to be in front of me.</v>

1091
00:45:37.351 --> 00:45:39.240
<v Speaker 3>What I like about you in front of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>camera though,</v>

1092
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:40.103
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1093
00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:42.450
<v Speaker 3>you're wearing the same clothes you</v>
<v Speaker 3>wear,</v>

1094
00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:44.610
<v Speaker 3>you talk the way you talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1095
00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:48.630
<v Speaker 3>like even my wife goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the guy who makes the</v>

1096
00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:50.880
<v Speaker 3>documentaries go with a backwards</v>
<v Speaker 3>baseball hat on.</v>

1097
00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:51.970
<v Speaker 3>That's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1098
00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:53.010
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is he dressed like that?</v>

1099
00:45:53.011 --> 00:45:54.570
<v Speaker 3>I go because that's how he dresses all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

1100
00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:56.070
<v Speaker 3>I've gone to the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1101
00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:57.090
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>

1102
00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:58.950
<v Speaker 3>Like that's who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's who you are.</v>

1103
00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:00.360
<v Speaker 3>That's how you dress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good.</v>

1104
00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:01.690
<v Speaker 3>It's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1105
00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:02.543
<v Speaker 3>Same all the time.</v>

1106
00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:05.580
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to bullshit anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there was a couple interviews in</v>

1107
00:46:05.581 --> 00:46:06.121
<v Speaker 3>bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stronger,</v>

1108
00:46:06.121 --> 00:46:08.190
<v Speaker 3>faster where I went into like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>senator,</v>

1109
00:46:08.191 --> 00:46:09.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm wearing a suit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1110
00:46:09.121 --> 00:46:11.400
<v Speaker 3>I just figured like that's probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>appropriate,</v>

1111
00:46:11.401 --> 00:46:14.600
<v Speaker 3>but like other other times I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>interviewed a lawyer and I had dressed</v>

1112
00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:17.370
<v Speaker 3>up a little bit more and then I looked</v>
<v Speaker 3>back at him like why did I do that?</v>

1113
00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:17.780
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1114
00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:21.180
<v Speaker 3>I have a bad idea when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>interviewing a senator or something like</v>

1115
00:46:21.181 --> 00:46:23.670
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>present yourself because the other</v>

1116
00:46:23.671 --> 00:46:25.950
<v Speaker 3>people don't take you a little more</v>
<v Speaker 3>seriously and they,</v>

1117
00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:27.930
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had conversations with people on</v>

1118
00:46:27.931 --> 00:46:31.260
<v Speaker 3>the podcast like especially early on in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the career with a kind of like a little</v>

1119
00:46:31.261 --> 00:46:34.590
<v Speaker 3>dismissive of me because maybe I had</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a t shirt on that was stupid</v>

1120
00:46:34.591 --> 00:46:37.050
<v Speaker 3>tattoos and smelling it read like</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

1121
00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:39.420
<v Speaker 3>just assume that I'm an idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1122
00:46:39.421 --> 00:46:41.850
<v Speaker 3>until we have the would be dismissive</v>
<v Speaker 3>initially.</v>

1123
00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:42.670
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hmm,</v>

1124
00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:46.140
<v Speaker 3>approached you to set this up better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if I had an office that looked real</v>

1125
00:46:46.141 --> 00:46:49.170
<v Speaker 3>nice and this desk was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this desk is a mess right now.</v>

1126
00:46:49.171 --> 00:46:52.440
<v Speaker 3>But if I was at in front of something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that looked more professional,</v>

1127
00:46:52.441 --> 00:46:56.610
<v Speaker 3>maybe they would approach this with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little more professional attitude as</v>

1128
00:46:56.611 --> 00:46:58.110
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you showing up with a suit.</v>

1129
00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:00.760
<v Speaker 3>Not necessarily a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's a bad idea.</v>

1130
00:47:00.761 --> 00:47:01.880
<v Speaker 3>I have to say that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1131
00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:03.660
<v Speaker 3>some of the other interviews where I</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't,</v>

1132
00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:05.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't being me.</v>

1133
00:47:05.311 --> 00:47:07.500
<v Speaker 3>And I knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He felt it felt weird.</v>

1134
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:09.090
<v Speaker 3>Natasha just been me know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1135
00:47:09.091 --> 00:47:10.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

1136
00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:14.250
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's only the only bad way to do it</v>

1137
00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:17.370
<v Speaker 3>when you're doing something like what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing is to do something where</v>

1138
00:47:17.371 --> 00:47:20.220
<v Speaker 3>you don't like what you're doing because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's your work.</v>

1139
00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:22.470
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like these documentaries are your</v>

1140
00:47:22.471 --> 00:47:25.710
<v Speaker 3>creation still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think that you don't go confront people.</v>

1141
00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:29.330
<v Speaker 3>He'd go ask all the right questions and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you give a,</v>

1142
00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:30.080
<v Speaker 3>give a person</v>

1143
00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:33.940
<v Speaker 1>enough rope to hang themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happens every single time.</v>

1144
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:34.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1145
00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:36.090
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1146
00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:38.470
<v Speaker 1>It's magical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when you're acting yourself,</v>

1147
00:47:38.471 --> 00:47:41.740
<v Speaker 1>you'll probably get more out of one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best shows ever on television was</v>

00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:43.320
<v Speaker 1>penn and teller bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1149
00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:45.250
<v Speaker 1>They would just let people ramble and</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk and go,</v>

1150
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:46.870
<v Speaker 1>and then they would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1151
00:47:46.871 --> 00:47:48.010
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

1277
00:52:44.541 --> 00:52:46.760

<v Speaker 1>Here is a different event.</v>

1278
00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:49.660
<v Speaker 1>This is a kettle bell.</v>

1279
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:52.900
<v Speaker 1>Kettlebell 60 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Brian's show.</v>

1280
00:52:52.901 --> 00:52:55.280
<v Speaker 1>That's way more than 60 pounds unless</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hollow.</v>

1281
00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:57.140
<v Speaker 1>Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>60 pound kettlebell.</v>

1282
00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:00.290
<v Speaker 1>But we'd win a whole lot back it up now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably more like 70 or 80,</v>

1283
00:53:00.291 --> 00:53:01.190
<v Speaker 1>but can't be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look how.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Look at the size of that Kettlebell.</v>

1287
00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:08.470
<v Speaker 1>The kettlebell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way he's walking with it might be</v>

1288
00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:10.040
<v Speaker 1>100.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That has to be hollow.</v>

1289
00:53:10.041 --> 00:53:11.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that,</v>

1290
00:53:11.271 --> 00:53:15.910

<v Speaker 1>See that Werewolf in the far left.</v>

1293
00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:23.690

<v Speaker 1>Those are different.</v>

1294
00:53:23.691 --> 00:53:27.730
<v Speaker 1>Those are specialty things or cast iron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are specialty things that their</v>

1295
00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:29.100
<v Speaker 1>topics are bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I blame someone or you're lying.</v>

1318
00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:28.450
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1319
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:30.630
<v Speaker 1>I believe my guests can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1320
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:32.550
<v Speaker 1>this guy's a big hunter like yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1321
00:54:32.551 --> 00:54:34.830
<v Speaker 1>he's into fishing and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like does he use his teeth?</v>

1322
00:54:34.831 --> 00:54:36.500
<v Speaker 1>Is he pulled out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He probably</v>

1323
00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:41.910
<v Speaker 1>isn't the record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Throws a 45 pound plate at their head.</v>

1324
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:44.830
<v Speaker 1>Game of thrones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actor half door Bjornsen.</v>

1325
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:49.590
<v Speaker 1>He's on game of thrones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He threw a 56 pound kettlebell over a 40</v>

1326
00:54:49.591 --> 00:54:51.140
<v Speaker 1>foot record.</v>

1327
00:54:53.350 --> 00:54:55.170
<v Speaker 1>So 50 foot six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>11,</v>

1328
00:54:55.171 --> 00:54:57.570
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 is retarded about being.</v>

1329
00:54:57.580 --> 00:55:01.620
<v Speaker 1>These guys are</v>
<v Speaker 1>world record of it.</v>

1330
00:55:01.621 --> 00:55:03.320
<v Speaker 1>So Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's heavy,</v>

1331
00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:05.250
<v Speaker 1>heaviest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you try to throw a 30 pound</v>

1332
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:07.980
<v Speaker 1>Kettlebell over that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would probably die doing it.</v>

1333
00:55:07.981 --> 00:55:08.840
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the book,</v>

1334
00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:10.260
<v Speaker 1>here's the video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this.</v>

1335
00:55:10.290 --> 00:55:12.290
<v Speaker 1>That's a one arm swing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that might be a little harder.</v>

1336
00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:15.220
<v Speaker 1>One 56 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's fine.</v>

1337
00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:19.240
<v Speaker 1>That was a world record when he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was pretty cool.</v>

1338
00:55:19.241 --> 00:55:22.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is actually a vice documentary.</v>

1339
00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple of thousand pound</v>

1340
00:55:23.791 --> 00:55:26.220
<v Speaker 1>deadlifts too in the world's strongest</v>
<v Speaker 1>man competition.</v>

1341
00:55:26.221 --> 00:55:28.020
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was A.</v>

1342
00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Hall did a thousand 26 and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian Shaw that a thousand 21.</v>

1343
00:55:31.951 --> 00:55:36.210
<v Speaker 1>It was just fucking Brendan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of these guys are doing</v>

1344
00:55:36.211 --> 00:55:36.991
<v Speaker 1>steroids?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1345
00:55:36.991 --> 00:55:38.310
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the world's strongest man.</v>

1346
00:55:38.311 --> 00:55:39.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's part of the.</v>

1347
00:55:39.810 --> 00:55:43.050
<v Speaker 1>It's part of the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 99 percent is part of the sport and</v>

1348
00:55:43.051 --> 00:55:44.840
<v Speaker 1>it's part of a bodybuilding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1349
00:55:44.841 --> 00:55:47.400
<v Speaker 1>as part of a lot of sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a perfect world,</v>

1350
00:55:47.401 --> 00:55:49.310
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of the athletes would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1351
00:55:49.311 --> 00:55:51.810
<v Speaker 1>to perfect world there'd be nothing out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there that we could take to get better,</v>

1352
00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:53.580
<v Speaker 1>but that's just not the world we live</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

1353
00:55:53.581 --> 00:55:56.190
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's kind of the case with</v>

1354
00:55:56.191 --> 00:55:59.880
<v Speaker 1>a lot of art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are some guys that are just large</v>

1355
00:55:59.881 --> 00:56:02.280
<v Speaker 1>human beings that can handle big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big amount of weights.</v>

1356
00:56:02.281 --> 00:56:05.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean you've probably seen it in mma</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people just have a different</v>

1357
00:56:05.611 --> 00:56:06.340
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You like,</v>

1358
00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:10.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that guy is like five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine.</v>

1359
00:56:10.201 --> 00:56:15.201
<v Speaker 1>He has to cut weight to get the suit to</v>
<v Speaker 1>65 and he's just built like electronic.</v>

1360
00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:17.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't just wrestle somebody</v>

1361
00:56:17.611 --> 00:56:21.120
<v Speaker 1>and you can't even grab the risks</v>
<v Speaker 1>because risk is all huge in hands and</v>

1362
00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:24.510
<v Speaker 1>feet are all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like what the John and Johnson</v>

1363
00:56:24.511 --> 00:56:28.270
<v Speaker 1>and Johnson that we've known him since</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was 22 years old and you know,</v>

1364
00:56:28.271 --> 00:56:31.420
<v Speaker 1>we were kind of instrumental in getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>him into wrestling and so when we met</v>

1365
00:56:31.421 --> 00:56:31.901
<v Speaker 1>him we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1366
00:56:31.901 --> 00:56:34.750
<v Speaker 1>you're a freak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your forearms or the size of my head.</v>

1367
00:56:34.810 --> 00:56:39.810
<v Speaker 1>He's got a double sized risks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>risks together and he wears a head band</v>

1368
00:56:39.881 --> 00:56:40.720
<v Speaker 1>around his biceps.</v>

1369
00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:44.313
<v Speaker 1>Were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey.</v>

1370
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:47.920
<v Speaker 1>And he got picked up by wwe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like pretty much right away.</v>

1371
00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:49.660
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty easy for him.</v>

1372
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:51.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely some physical freaks.</v>

1373
00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:53.110
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely some physical for</v>
<v Speaker 1>expression.</v>

1374
00:56:53.111 --> 00:56:54.950
<v Speaker 1>Always wondered like when you see those</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong mankind's,</v>

1375
00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:56.350
<v Speaker 1>like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1376
00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:59.140
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine that any of them could</v>
<v Speaker 1>not be on steroids.</v>

1377
00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:02.860
<v Speaker 1>I doubt that any of them are probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>cleaned just due to the sheer amount of</v>

1378
00:57:02.890 --> 00:57:05.440
<v Speaker 1>weight that they have to weigh and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sheer amount of weight that they have to</v>

1379
00:57:05.441 --> 00:57:07.720
<v Speaker 1>lift it just wouldn't really make sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it without.</v>

1380
00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:11.740
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to go in and lose.</v>

1381
00:57:11.741 --> 00:57:12.551
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the purpose,</v>

1382
00:57:12.551 --> 00:57:13.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1383
00:57:13.451 --> 00:57:13.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1384
00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:15.180
<v Speaker 1>we talked about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>

1385
00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:16.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1386
00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:19.990
<v Speaker 1>hormone replacement therapy and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1387
00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:22.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about prescription thugs and</v>

1388
00:57:22.091 --> 00:57:22.560
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like,</v>

1389
00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:24.310
<v Speaker 1>well you take hormone replacement</v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy,</v>

1390
00:57:24.311 --> 00:57:25.740
<v Speaker 1>but I think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hormones is like,</v>

1391
00:57:26.290 --> 00:57:28.610
<v Speaker 1>it kind of balances me out and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other areas.</v>

1392
00:57:28.610 --> 00:57:30.100
<v Speaker 1>So I don't have to take pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1393
00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:32.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to take other drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>40th three.</v>

1394
00:57:32.890 --> 00:57:36.010
<v Speaker 1>And when did you start taking hormones?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comprise about.</v>

1395
00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:38.050
<v Speaker 1>Actually right after I had my hips done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was 30,</v>

1396
00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:42.340
<v Speaker 1>33 or 34 and it was because I had hip</v>
<v Speaker 1>replacement surgery.</v>

1397
00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:47.140
<v Speaker 1>So you started hormone replacement to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to boost your body's recovery?</v>

1398
00:57:47.970 --> 00:57:48.520
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1399
00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:51.580
<v Speaker 1>I was doing growth hormone then too and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like the growth hormone wasn't</v>

1400
00:57:51.581 --> 00:57:52.450
<v Speaker 1>really worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1401
00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:54.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean a lot of people financially you</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean?</v>

1402
00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:55.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a lot of people rave about it</v>

1403
00:57:55.601 --> 00:57:57.190
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what you get bang for your buck or</v>

1404
00:57:57.191 --> 00:57:57.700
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1405
00:57:57.700 --> 00:57:59.330
<v Speaker 1>if you're rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1406
00:57:59.331 --> 00:58:01.000
<v Speaker 1>it might.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it'll help you a little bit,</v>

1407
00:58:01.001 --> 00:58:03.130
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if you're trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>some crazy results.</v>

1408
00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:05.800
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you mean by like what were</v>
<v Speaker 1>you trying to do is a fan of growth</v>

1409
00:58:05.801 --> 00:58:06.130
<v Speaker 1>hormone.</v>

1410
00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:08.110
<v Speaker 1>It actually hurt my joints more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

1411
00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:11.920
<v Speaker 1>Anybody hands fall asleep all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A whole lot of water hands fall asleep.</v>

1412
00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:13.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take it.</v>

1413
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:14.920
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know everyone says that.</v>

1414
00:58:14.921 --> 00:58:16.870
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives you a Dema and everything.</v>

1415
00:58:16.871 --> 00:58:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes you hold a little bit of water</v>

1416
00:58:19.421 --> 00:58:21.730
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think at the time I've tried to.</v>

1417
00:58:21.731 --> 00:58:23.430
<v Speaker 1>I use a day and four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use a day that's,</v>

1418
00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:24.880
<v Speaker 1>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not much.</v>

1419
00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:28.060
<v Speaker 1>That's the big crazy bodybuilder guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>take like 10,</v>

1420
00:58:28.061 --> 00:58:28.894
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1421
00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:31.360
<v Speaker 1>if you're using it in conjunction with</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else,</v>

1422
00:58:31.361 --> 00:58:33.970
<v Speaker 1>like then you'd probably not optimizing</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

1423
00:58:33.971 --> 00:58:36.170
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense that it would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it would be effective for you,</v>

1424
00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:39.460
<v Speaker 1>but a little bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The major winner.</v>

1425
00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:41.740
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some people take it and say,</v>

1426
00:58:41.830 --> 00:58:42.611
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1427
00:58:42.611 --> 00:58:44.440
<v Speaker 1>growth hormone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got completely shredded.</v>

1428
00:58:44.890 --> 00:58:46.420
<v Speaker 1>And then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's just not the case.</v>

1429
00:58:47.650 --> 00:58:48.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1430
00:58:48.581 --> 00:58:51.100
<v Speaker 1>it also could be the now are on growth</v>
<v Speaker 1>hormone.</v>

1431
00:58:51.101 --> 00:58:54.130
<v Speaker 1>They really stepped up their training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all excited with her on growth</v>

1432
00:58:54.131 --> 00:58:54.964
<v Speaker 1>hormone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1433
00:58:55.030 --> 00:58:58.270
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of factors involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think suburbans do for the most part</v>

1434
00:58:58.271 --> 00:59:01.280
<v Speaker 1>to do with supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little bit of it.</v>

1435
00:59:01.290 --> 00:59:02.850
<v Speaker 1>It's going to help you a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them.</v>

1436
00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:06.730
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a little bit of placebo</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect if you're taking fish oil and</v>

1437
00:59:06.790 --> 00:59:08.560
<v Speaker 1>chugging down protein powder and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

1438
00:59:08.561 --> 00:59:10.120
<v Speaker 1>you're probably not eating pizza and</v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking beer.</v>

1439
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:13.450
<v Speaker 1>Well that's why double blind placebo</v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled studies are so important to</v>

1440
00:59:13.451 --> 00:59:15.760
<v Speaker 1>find out what actually does work and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what doesn't work.</v>

1441
00:59:15.761 --> 00:59:20.761
<v Speaker 1>What are the inflamed inflammation</v>
<v Speaker 1>markers in the blood and fish oil though</v>

1442
00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:22.360
<v Speaker 1>part about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like with uh,</v>

1443
00:59:22.790 --> 00:59:24.560
<v Speaker 1>with certain things like fish oils,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1444
00:59:24.561 --> 00:59:26.240
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it good for inflammation?</v>

1445
00:59:26.241 --> 00:59:27.074
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>

1446
00:59:27.350 --> 00:59:30.200
<v Speaker 1>But what people take it for is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there a lot of people take it for their</v>

1447
00:59:30.201 --> 00:59:31.920
<v Speaker 1>heart health and they realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1448
00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:35.180
<v Speaker 1>I got to take 12 pills a day for it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually be effective for my heart</v>

1449
00:59:35.181 --> 00:59:37.840
<v Speaker 1>health where you could get in</v>
<v Speaker 1>tablespoons to.</v>

1450
00:59:37.870 --> 00:59:38.770
<v Speaker 1>That's how I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1451
00:59:38.771 --> 00:59:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm saying like,</v>

1452
00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:43.340
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's not what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not as effective as</v>

1453
00:59:43.341 --> 00:59:44.200
<v Speaker 1>people think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1454
00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:45.650
<v Speaker 1>oh I to take fish oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1455
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:48.500
<v Speaker 1>And then they go out and they buy pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>effective,</v>

1456
00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:51.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit over a really long period</v>

1457
00:59:51.081 --> 00:59:52.850
<v Speaker 1>of time is probably the most effective</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1458
00:59:52.851 --> 00:59:55.120
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to stick with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely bad for anybody,</v>

1459
00:59:55.121 --> 00:59:56.570
<v Speaker 1>but I just think that it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1460
00:59:56.590 --> 00:59:58.880
<v Speaker 1>it's something that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1461
00:59:58.881 --> 01:00:00.380
<v Speaker 1>it's just another thing like maybe you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't need it,</v>

1462
01:00:00.410 --> 01:00:01.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1463
01:00:01.071 --> 01:00:02.190
<v Speaker 1>what is need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1464
01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:05.420
<v Speaker 1>it's your turn to optimize your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've tried to optimize your body</v>

1465
01:00:05.421 --> 01:00:09.530
<v Speaker 1>officially it was a good choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you want to get the results these</v>

1466
01:00:09.531 --> 01:00:11.990
<v Speaker 1>guys are talking about in these studies</v>
<v Speaker 1>and taking 12 pills a day,</v>

1467
01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:13.610
<v Speaker 1>you don't really have to take pills.</v>

1468
01:00:13.630 --> 01:00:14.990
<v Speaker 1>You can just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take it,</v>

1469
01:00:14.991 --> 01:00:15.850
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1470
01:00:16.010 --> 01:00:19.220
<v Speaker 1>it's a company name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crawson's crossings and things.</v>

1471
01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:20.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've been around forever.</v>

1472
01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:23.030
<v Speaker 1>They're in a bottle and just pour it</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a tablespoon.</v>

1473
01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.350
<v Speaker 1>I take a couple of tablespoons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1474
01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.270
<v Speaker 1>It's just so good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like flavor,</v>

1475
01:00:26.271 --> 01:00:28.190
<v Speaker 1>like lemon or something that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little lemon flavor.</v>

1476
01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:32.780
<v Speaker 1>I think just really getting out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about is a,</v>

1477
01:00:33.050 --> 01:00:35.270
<v Speaker 1>you're an addict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just expecting it to help improve</v>

1478
01:00:35.271 --> 01:00:36.260
<v Speaker 1>your health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is great.</v>

1479
01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:39.740
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people expect us to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something to have a heart attack.</v>

1480
01:00:39.741 --> 01:00:42.440
<v Speaker 1>If I take two of these a day and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they realize,</v>

1481
01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:43.910
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the study was done with 12 a day,</v>

1482
01:00:43.930 --> 01:00:44.611
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1483
01:00:44.611 --> 01:00:47.570
<v Speaker 1>they didn't take 12 bitch and step up</v>
<v Speaker 1>your game.</v>

1484
01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:50.300
<v Speaker 1>If you want to not have a heart attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a couple of aspirin a day.</v>

1485
01:00:50.301 --> 01:00:51.640
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that what's supposed to be like</v>

1486
01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:53.110
<v Speaker 1>one of the best things in the world for</v>
<v Speaker 1>your.</v>

1487
01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:55.120
<v Speaker 1>For your heart?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to help too.</v>

1488
01:00:55.121 --> 01:00:55.954
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allegedly.</v>

1489
01:00:56.010 --> 01:00:56.520
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

1490
01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:59.010
<v Speaker 1>I one to a today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is so many different fucking</v>

1491
01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:03.020
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be on the same time.</v>

1492
01:01:03.290 --> 01:01:08.290
<v Speaker 1>Take some part and be 12 and working</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

1493
01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:11.870
<v Speaker 1>They get you all stressed out about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you've got to take something for</v>

1494
01:01:11.871 --> 01:01:13.460
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing for Niacin?</v>

1495
01:01:13.490 --> 01:01:16.950
<v Speaker 1>What do I need to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of Nice,</v>

1496
01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:19.160
<v Speaker 1>and then you forget to take everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you get depressed.</v>

1497
01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:21.650
<v Speaker 1>You ever get that shit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever take that Flash Nice and flush?</v>

1498
01:01:22.850 --> 01:01:26.120
<v Speaker 1>I take that stuff every night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes your fucking skin turn red and</v>

1499
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:28.610
<v Speaker 1>you didn't take it at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really good for you.</v>

1500
01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:31.220
<v Speaker 1>It makes you go to sleep or just really</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when I take it,</v>

1501
01:01:31.221 --> 01:01:32.720
<v Speaker 1>but it's really good for your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1502
01:01:32.721 --> 01:01:35.210
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those things that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like taking because it gives you</v>

1503
01:01:35.211 --> 01:01:39.490
<v Speaker 1>that weird good for your blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>readings,</v>

1504
01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:42.560
<v Speaker 1>but just that effect is temporary.</v>

1505
01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Although</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take that,</v>

1506
01:01:49.550 --> 01:01:52.340
<v Speaker 1>I take it like a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think that flush nice and doesn't.</v>

1507
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:54.200
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1508
01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:55.520
<v Speaker 1>What are you afraid of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little flush.</v>

1509
01:01:55.550 --> 01:01:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1510
01:01:55.890 --> 01:01:57.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm not scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

1511
01:01:58.100 --> 01:01:59.450
<v Speaker 1>That's what separates the men from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>boys.</v>

1512
01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:02.510
<v Speaker 1>All that weird feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Afraid of looking like you have poison</v>

1513
01:02:02.511 --> 01:02:04.660
<v Speaker 1>ivy or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My eyes itch.</v>

1514
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:09.230
<v Speaker 1>And did you find that stone at 5:55</v>
<v Speaker 1>stoning and pull that sucker up man.</v>

1515
01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:10.970
<v Speaker 1>I think that's unbelievably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>

1516
01:02:11.950 --> 01:02:15.080
<v Speaker 1>It supplements that you were saying like</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on like what people are</v>

1517
01:02:15.081 --> 01:02:15.650
<v Speaker 1>expecting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1518
01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:19.950
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times certain things will rave</v>
<v Speaker 1>about testosterone,</v>

1519
01:02:19.951 --> 01:02:21.840
<v Speaker 1>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no way.</v>

1520
01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:25.170
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely zero chance that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's going to work as good as</v>

1521
01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:26.730
<v Speaker 1>injecting testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1522
01:02:26.731 --> 01:02:30.360
<v Speaker 1>if it does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it works better than testosterone,</v>

1523
01:02:30.361 --> 01:02:31.750
<v Speaker 1>you're going to fuck your body up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1524
01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.690
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's going to have side effects.</v>

1525
01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:37.110
<v Speaker 1>If there was something out there that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the cure that they like,</v>

1526
01:02:37.111 --> 01:02:39.000
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't have to advertise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People will just know about it.</v>

1527
01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:41.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the most important supplement.</v>

1528
01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:45.860
<v Speaker 1>The most important thing that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>take is really healthy food and when did</v>

1529
01:02:45.861 --> 01:02:47.910
<v Speaker 1>you start throwing down all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplements,</v>

1530
01:02:47.911 --> 01:02:50.070
<v Speaker 1>but you're eating fucking big MACs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>

1531
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:51.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that.</v>

1532
01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:55.980
<v Speaker 1>I got a friend was telling me like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the chemical components of all</v>

1533
01:02:56.010 --> 01:02:58.470
<v Speaker 1>really healthy food already exists in</v>
<v Speaker 1>vitamin,</v>

1534
01:02:58.471 --> 01:03:00.630
<v Speaker 1>so just eat whatever the fuck you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take vitamins.</v>

1535
01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:01.651
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1536
01:03:01.651 --> 01:03:04.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think it works.</v>

1537
01:03:04.590 --> 01:03:07.080
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work like that for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem is people use it as a</v>

1538
01:03:07.081 --> 01:03:07.914
<v Speaker 1>safeguard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1539
01:03:08.490 --> 01:03:10.110
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time I met you,</v>

1540
01:03:10.111 --> 01:03:11.820
<v Speaker 1>it was after one of your shows at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ice house.</v>

1541
01:03:11.821 --> 01:03:12.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if you remember.</v>

1542
01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.700
<v Speaker 1>We were outside in the back and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1543
01:03:14.890 --> 01:03:17.640
<v Speaker 1>have you were talking to Brian Callan</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all these other guys and uh,</v>

1544
01:03:17.641 --> 01:03:20.430
<v Speaker 1>you were saying every time we go on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>road I got to go to a whole foods and I</v>

1545
01:03:20.431 --> 01:03:24.000
<v Speaker 1>thought that was so cool that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually take the time to go out and get</v>

1546
01:03:24.001 --> 01:03:25.310
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when you're on the road,</v>

1547
01:03:25.330 --> 01:03:27.220
<v Speaker 1>get the right food and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a,</v>

1548
01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:30.810
<v Speaker 1>that was actually inspirational for me</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hear because you don't have somebody</v>

1549
01:03:30.811 --> 01:03:32.370
<v Speaker 1>that struggled with my weight all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1550
01:03:32.371 --> 01:03:35.370
<v Speaker 1>And like sometimes I think that stuff is</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird or people might think I'm weird if</v>

1551
01:03:35.371 --> 01:03:37.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if you're spending the</v>

1552
01:03:37.550 --> 01:03:37.830
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1553
01:03:37.830 --> 01:03:39.810
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just good to know that like other</v>

1554
01:03:39.811 --> 01:03:43.380
<v Speaker 1>people that are doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why you traveled on the road for so many</v>

1555
01:03:43.381 --> 01:03:44.400
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there's no.</v>

1556
01:03:44.430 --> 01:03:47.640
<v Speaker 1>Unless I stay in a place that has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good restaurant and I know they</v>

1557
01:03:47.641 --> 01:03:50.370
<v Speaker 1>have really healthy salads and real</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy food options.</v>

1558
01:03:50.650 --> 01:03:52.200
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even if that's the case,</v>

1559
01:03:52.201 --> 01:03:53.610
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to drink?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1560
01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:54.770
<v Speaker 1>it's cool if they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1561
01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:56.040
<v Speaker 1>bottled waters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

1562
01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:59.580
<v Speaker 1>But I drink Kombucha a lot so I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanting to make sure that I have enough</v>

1563
01:03:59.581 --> 01:04:03.150
<v Speaker 1>probiotics and I want healthy snacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to have to go through the</v>

1564
01:04:03.151 --> 01:04:06.360
<v Speaker 1>fucking minibar and eat peanut m and m's</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all that bullshit.</v>

1565
01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:07.560
<v Speaker 1>Middle of the knife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hungry.</v>

1566
01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:09.150
<v Speaker 1>It makes you feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1567
01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:11.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes you feel like a loser and I</v>

1568
01:04:11.410 --> 01:04:13.230
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's nothing wrong with eating</v>

1569
01:04:13.231 --> 01:04:16.110
<v Speaker 1>shitty food every now and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part,</v>

1570
01:04:16.111 --> 01:04:19.990
<v Speaker 1>the base of your diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking gotta be healthy and stay</v>

1571
01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:20.670
<v Speaker 1>on top of it.</v>

1572
01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:24.720
<v Speaker 1>God vegetable for the years that I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going through my addiction stuff,</v>

1573
01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:29.670
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't take care of myself at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I did was I was 260 pounds and I</v>

1574
01:04:29.671 --> 01:04:32.640
<v Speaker 1>right now the way I today I weighed like</v>
<v Speaker 1>$200 on a dot.</v>

1575
01:04:32.641 --> 01:04:34.560
<v Speaker 1>So that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's a big difference.</v>

1576
01:04:34.561 --> 01:04:35.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a big difference.</v>

1577
01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:36.691
<v Speaker 1>I'm fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1578
01:04:36.691 --> 01:04:38.910
<v Speaker 1>really fat in that movie and I still</v>
<v Speaker 1>think I have a long way to go.</v>

1579
01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:41.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to weigh 3:30 and I kinda got up</v>

1580
01:04:41.371 --> 01:04:44.730
<v Speaker 1>there on purpose just to pluck and</v>
<v Speaker 1>gained strength and I went from like</v>

1581
01:04:44.731 --> 01:04:45.870
<v Speaker 1>$300.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1582
01:04:45.871 --> 01:04:47.100
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian Shaw,</v>

1583
01:04:47.130 --> 01:04:49.230
<v Speaker 1>555.</v>
<v Speaker 1>World Records,</v>

1584
01:04:49.231 --> 01:04:51.270
<v Speaker 1>stone lift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1585

<v Speaker 1>So that's impossible to pick up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean look how big his hands are.</v>

1586
01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:59.430
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>555 pounds.</v>

1587
01:04:59.431 --> 01:05:03.780
<v Speaker 1>And it's a ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's a size of a large medicine</v>

1588
01:05:03.781 --> 01:05:04.890
<v Speaker 1>ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An atlas stone.</v>

1589
01:05:04.891 --> 01:05:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an object not meant to be lifted,</v>

1590
01:05:07.411 --> 01:05:08.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like a barbell or anything.</v>

1591
01:05:08.790 --> 01:05:11.520
<v Speaker 1>Not really interesting to put it up over</v>
<v Speaker 1>that platform.</v>

1592
01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:12.571
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's he doing this?</v>

1593
01:05:12.571 --> 01:05:14.070
<v Speaker 1>Why is this in slow motion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the other way,</v>

1594
01:05:14.290 --> 01:05:15.960
<v Speaker 1>but that platform is about as tall as I</v>
<v Speaker 1>am.</v>

1595
01:05:15.961 --> 01:05:17.300
<v Speaker 1>Almost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

1596
01:05:17.350 --> 01:05:19.120
<v Speaker 1>That tub.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is He that big?</v>

1597
01:05:19.450 --> 01:05:20.283
<v Speaker 1>He's six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eight.</v>

1598
01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:21.311
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's huge.</v>

1599
01:05:21.311 --> 01:05:22.990
<v Speaker 1>He uses Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

1600
01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:28.270
<v Speaker 1>That's probably up to my shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a big boy right there.</v>

1601
01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:31.660
<v Speaker 1>That's an enormous human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas slingshot elbow sleeves,</v>

1602
01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:36.130
<v Speaker 1>if you noticed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>harmful slingshot and what do you think</v>

1603
01:05:36.131 --> 01:05:39.790
<v Speaker 1>that guy eats in a day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He eats like about 8,000 calories a day.</v>

1604
01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:41.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1605
01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:42.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

1606
01:05:42.961 --> 01:05:43.794
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>picked up.</v>

1607
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:46.140
<v Speaker 1>I haven't picked up from the airport and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1608
01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:48.550
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and brought to my house by like a limo,</v>

1609
01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:52.300
<v Speaker 1>lamb shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he took a picture in the limousine</v>

1610
01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:53.400
<v Speaker 1>of him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1611
01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:57.160
<v Speaker 1>with his wife and the limo and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating salmon out of a fucking thing,</v>

1612
01:05:57.180 --> 01:05:58.880
<v Speaker 1>like container tupperware.</v>

1613
01:05:59.130 --> 01:06:01.480
<v Speaker 1>That thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing about that guy is everything</v>

1614
01:06:01.481 --> 01:06:04.990
<v Speaker 1>is so systematic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing to be in his presence</v>

1615
01:06:04.991 --> 01:06:05.890
<v Speaker 1>because he talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1616
01:06:05.891 --> 01:06:07.780
<v Speaker 1>like he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't eat bad,</v>

1617
01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:08.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't.</v>

1618
01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:10.950
<v Speaker 1>He's on target to just be the world's</v>
<v Speaker 1>strongest man.</v>

1619
01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:13.660
<v Speaker 1>He's won it three times and he's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>for for this year,</v>

1620
01:06:13.661 --> 01:06:14.494
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1621
01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:15.401
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And usually he's like,</v>

1622
01:06:15.401 --> 01:06:16.360
<v Speaker 1>when are we eating?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1623
01:06:16.361 --> 01:06:18.010
<v Speaker 1>probably like five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1624
01:06:18.011 --> 01:06:18.670
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1625
01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:20.050
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like almost four.</v>

1626
01:06:20.051 --> 01:06:21.760
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should probably sneak in a meal now.</v>

1627
01:06:21.761 --> 01:06:24.550
<v Speaker 1>So He ate before we ate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he brought meals already made and</v>

1628
01:06:24.551 --> 01:06:25.540
<v Speaker 1>everything was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1629
01:06:25.541 --> 01:06:27.490
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at his supplements,</v>

1630
01:06:27.491 --> 01:06:29.800
<v Speaker 1>he's got this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a diet and supplements.</v>

1631
01:06:29.830 --> 01:06:34.450
<v Speaker 1>His meals are not that high in quantity</v>
<v Speaker 1>or in,</v>

1632
01:06:34.451 --> 01:06:37.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like ounces of protein,</v>

1633
01:06:37.570 --> 01:06:42.260
<v Speaker 1>like when you look at what he's eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 14 inch lean beef bodybuilding</v>

1634
01:06:42.310 --> 01:06:43.143
<v Speaker 1>magazine.</v>

1635
01:06:43.410 --> 01:06:45.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean this is what he's saying,</v>

1636
01:06:45.011 --> 01:06:45.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1637
01:06:45.370 --> 01:06:47.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ten Ounces Tilapia.</v>

1638
01:06:47.291 --> 01:06:50.800
<v Speaker 1>So he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are normal size meals,</v>

1639
01:06:50.801 --> 01:06:53.110
<v Speaker 1>which you would think a guy that's that</v>
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>

1640
01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:54.520
<v Speaker 1>he'd be eating like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1641
01:06:54.550 --> 01:06:57.430
<v Speaker 1>56 ounce steak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'd really look at it.</v>

1642
01:06:57.431 --> 01:06:59.770
<v Speaker 1>There's almost nine up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's pre workout,</v>

1643
01:06:59.771 --> 01:07:01.950
<v Speaker 1>post workout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are kind of more like shakes,</v>

1644
01:07:01.951 --> 01:07:03.820
<v Speaker 1>but there's like a pudding in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five,</v>

1645
01:07:03.821 --> 01:07:05.020
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

1646
01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:07.300
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>

1647
01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:09.640
<v Speaker 1>10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like 10 different times he's eating</v>

1648
01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:11.960
<v Speaker 1>his entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1649
01:07:11.970 --> 01:07:14.440
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's obsessed with his entire day is</v>

1650
01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:15.850
<v Speaker 1>driven towards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1651
01:07:15.970 --> 01:07:17.890
<v Speaker 1>continue to kick everybody's ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1652
01:07:18.070 --> 01:07:20.060
<v Speaker 1>But even in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're,</v>

1653
01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:23.800
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at insane amounts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>calories even with the small,</v>

1654
01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:24.870
<v Speaker 1>smaller meals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1655
01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:27.850
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting about him too is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's four days of training week and</v>

1656
01:07:27.851 --> 01:07:31.390
<v Speaker 1>three days of full recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So three days he's doing contrast baths</v>

1657
01:07:31.391 --> 01:07:33.790
<v Speaker 1>and he's like all the shit that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>always talk about he's doing.</v>

1658
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.580
<v Speaker 1>He goes to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes to a pet place and just as</v>

1659
01:07:36.850 --> 01:07:38.640
<v Speaker 1>physical therapy drills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1660
01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:41.500
<v Speaker 1>we saw him get on the floor and he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing all kinds of shit.</v>

1661
01:07:41.501 --> 01:07:42.610
<v Speaker 1>We were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>

1662
01:07:42.611 --> 01:07:44.290
<v Speaker 1>How is he moves around like way better</v>
<v Speaker 1>than I do.</v>

1663
01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:46.780
<v Speaker 1>He's moves around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great Smart Guy,</v>

1664
01:07:46.781 --> 01:07:47.261
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1665
01:07:47.261 --> 01:07:50.350
<v Speaker 1>that's really where it's at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of people that do</v>

1666
01:07:50.351 --> 01:07:54.160
<v Speaker 1>too much work and not enough recovery</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they just kinda mentally tough their</v>

1667
01:07:54.161 --> 01:07:58.210
<v Speaker 1>way through it instead of less work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more recovery and probably better</v>

1668
01:07:58.211 --> 01:07:59.650
<v Speaker 1>results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where I'm at right now.</v>

1669
01:07:59.651 --> 01:08:02.530
<v Speaker 1>I just fucked up my elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They recommended a what does it.</v>

1670
01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:03.910
<v Speaker 1>PRP injections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1671
01:08:03.930 --> 01:08:06.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My elbow has been bothering me for a</v>

1672
01:08:06.551 --> 01:08:08.480
<v Speaker 1>little while that's going on with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1673
01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:10.720
<v Speaker 1>I was training for a competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was uh,</v>

1674
01:08:10.750 --> 01:08:15.750
<v Speaker 1>going after a 600 pound bench and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up my elbow midway through</v>

1675
01:08:15.801 --> 01:08:16.160
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>

1676
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:19.250
<v Speaker 1>I did a 5:55 bench for a double.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a big pr for me.</v>

1677
01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:20.720
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1678
01:08:20.770 --> 01:08:25.770
<v Speaker 1>through our means personal record for</v>
<v Speaker 1>pb upns.</v>

1679
01:08:26.210 --> 01:08:28.340
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1680
01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:31.760
<v Speaker 1>got it banged up somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was from that bench</v>

1681
01:08:31.761 --> 01:08:33.290
<v Speaker 1>exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but two or three days later,</v>

1682
01:08:33.291 --> 01:08:34.250
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it started to hurt.</v>

1683
01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:36.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think I was going to be able to</v>

1684
01:08:36.981 --> 01:08:38.570
<v Speaker 1>compete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was still able to compete.</v>

1685
01:08:38.571 --> 01:08:42.680
<v Speaker 1>About five or six weeks later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got a 22 pound bench pr in the meat but</v>

1686
01:08:42.681 --> 01:08:45.560
<v Speaker 1>missed a 600 pound bench.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did bench five slash 78.</v>

1687
01:08:46.170 --> 01:08:48.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I went to bed 600,</v>

1688
01:08:48.350 --> 01:08:51.860
<v Speaker 1>I slightly toward my pack and I think I</v>
<v Speaker 1>tore my peck because my elbow was jacked</v>

1689
01:08:51.861 --> 01:08:53.990
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you just need some time off.</v>

1690
01:08:54.050 --> 01:08:54.883
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pack,</v>

1691
01:08:55.310 --> 01:08:56.960
<v Speaker 1>clear it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's all good with that,</v>

1692
01:08:56.961 --> 01:09:01.961
<v Speaker 1>but the elbow is still all jacked up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I just went and got an Mri yesterday,</v>

1693
01:09:02.211 --> 01:09:04.250
<v Speaker 1>which was fucking crazy.</v>

1694
01:09:04.250 --> 01:09:06.140
<v Speaker 1>They stuffed me in this little tiny</v>
<v Speaker 1>machine.</v>

1695
01:09:06.270 --> 01:09:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Never had one before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1696
01:09:07.490 --> 01:09:09.830
<v Speaker 1>I've never had it before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never had a surgery or nothing.</v>

1697
01:09:09.831 --> 01:09:11.840
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a Mris are weird.</v>

1698
01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was terrified.</v>

1699
01:09:12.771 --> 01:09:15.160
<v Speaker 1>I was in there for like half an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

1700
01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:17.710
<v Speaker 1>Awesome hammering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1701
01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:19.140
<v Speaker 1>After I got out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1702
01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:22.770
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just like a crazy noises,</v>

1703
01:09:22.790 --> 01:09:24.650
<v Speaker 1>so string,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so claustrophobic.</v>

1704
01:09:24.651 --> 01:09:26.000
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy fuck.</v>

1705
01:09:26.001 --> 01:09:27.750
<v Speaker 1>That was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

1706
01:09:27.770 --> 01:09:30.020
<v Speaker 1>now I have to try to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have kind of these,</v>

1707
01:09:30.021 --> 01:09:32.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they call them chronic tears,</v>

1708
01:09:32.690 --> 01:09:36.830
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't really help me at all and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all they told me what chronic tears</v>

1709
01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:41.540
<v Speaker 1>and tons of inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I got to figure out ways to just get</v>

1710
01:09:41.541 --> 01:09:44.750
<v Speaker 1>it to heal up on its own basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you looked into stem cells?</v>

1711
01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:47.930
<v Speaker 1>I haven't tried anything yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when we get out of the podcast,</v>

1712
01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:51.360
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you some stem cells in.</v>

1713
01:09:53.230 --> 01:09:57.230
<v Speaker 1>My doctor is actually one of the guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>like leading the way and in stem cells</v>

1714
01:09:57.231 --> 01:10:00.110
<v Speaker 1>and sounds amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing stem cells in Las Vegas</v>

1715
01:10:00.111 --> 01:10:01.940
<v Speaker 1>where they're taking them from woman's</v>
<v Speaker 1>placenta,</v>

1716
01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:04.990
<v Speaker 1>whether it's some into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

1717

<v Speaker 1>I can't get in trouble for my wife for.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Women who have had some Syrian section.</v>

<v Speaker 1>they take her stem cells,</v>

1722
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:17.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the placenta and they inject them</v>

1723
01:10:17.121 --> 01:10:21.140
<v Speaker 1>directly into your injuries and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have had fucking spectacular sent into</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's amazing to hear about the</v>

1726
01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:27.890
<v Speaker 1>Wolverine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how many of those do you think?</v>

1727
01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:29.690
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

1728
01:10:29.691 --> 01:10:33.470
<v Speaker 1>it is probably one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>spectacular healing methods you need</v>

1729
01:10:33.471 --> 01:10:35.600
<v Speaker 1>several shots of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or like one shot,</v>

1730
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:36.560
<v Speaker 1>one shot at.</v>

1731
01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:39.620
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy that I'm Arnold</v>
<v Speaker 1>Schwarzenegger I think gave an award to</v>

1732
01:10:39.650 --> 01:10:41.870
<v Speaker 1>last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the year before had ocular cancer.</v>

1733
01:10:41.871 --> 01:10:43.670
<v Speaker 1>So he couldn't see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as I,</v>

1734
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:46.660
<v Speaker 1>and one of his eyes and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did stem cells,</v>

1735
01:10:46.770 --> 01:10:51.680
<v Speaker 1>stem cell thing on him and after like 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks he had like full vision of that.</v>

1736
01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:53.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how,</v>

1737
01:10:53.031 --> 01:10:55.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I remember all of the sorts and they</v>

1738
01:10:55.591 --> 01:10:57.200
<v Speaker 1>are giving them a warden talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that being,</v>

1739
01:10:57.201 --> 01:10:58.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not surprised.</v>

1740
01:10:58.910 --> 01:10:59.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm not surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1741
01:11:00.170 --> 01:11:04.820
<v Speaker 1>I was fucking stunned at what it did to</v>
<v Speaker 1>my shoulder and I've since had my hip</v>

1742
01:11:04.821 --> 01:11:07.940
<v Speaker 1>done and my knee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my hip was like barely bothering me.</v>

1743
01:11:07.941 --> 01:11:09.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking shoot it up.</v>

1744
01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:10.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1745
01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.650
<v Speaker 1>it just bothered me after hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing workouts,</v>

1746
01:11:12.651 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 1>but not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even to</v>

1747
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:15.000
<v Speaker 3>the point where.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I was like,</v>

1748
01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:18.090
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't do a damage or is this a good</v>

1749
01:11:18.091 --> 01:11:19.080
<v Speaker 3>thing to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Preventative.</v>

1750
01:11:19.490 --> 01:11:20.130
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1751
01:11:20.130 --> 01:11:22.260
<v Speaker 3>probably be a good thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Preventative for weeks later,</v>

1752
01:11:22.261 --> 01:11:24.020
<v Speaker 3>not a fucking single pain no matter how</v>
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>

1753
01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:27.030
<v Speaker 3>Shadow over my whole body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my knee was bothering me.</v>

1754
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:28.980
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's shown that they can regenerate</v>

1755
01:11:28.981 --> 01:11:33.000
<v Speaker 3>cartilage and Manila.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's insane because it's literally the</v>

1756
01:11:33.010 --> 01:11:37.830
<v Speaker 3>building block kind of tissue can</v>
<v Speaker 3>regenerate any tissue,</v>

1757
01:11:37.831 --> 01:11:41.040
<v Speaker 3>like partial tears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know some of my meathead friends are</v>

1758
01:11:41.041 --> 01:11:44.110
<v Speaker 3>real fans of these like weird peptides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like growth hormone.</v>

1759
01:11:44.111 --> 01:11:48.850
<v Speaker 3>Then there's igf one and now there's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of shit that I can't pronounce any</v>

1760
01:11:48.851 --> 01:11:51.180
<v Speaker 3>more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it makes your body develop more</v>

1761
01:11:51.181 --> 01:11:54.630
<v Speaker 3>growth hormone and testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I tried some different things and I,</v>

1762
01:11:54.631 --> 01:11:56.220
<v Speaker 3>I didn't find any of those to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>effective.</v>

1763
01:11:56.221 --> 01:12:01.020
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to say it's a secret.</v>

1764
01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:04.560
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need that guy's number because we're</v>

1765
01:12:04.561 --> 01:12:05.940
<v Speaker 3>both ganged up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll help you out.</v>

1766
01:12:05.970 --> 01:12:06.990
<v Speaker 3>I'll help you out at the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>pocket.</v>

1767
01:12:06.991 --> 01:12:09.870
<v Speaker 3>His name is Dr Rodney Mcgee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If anybody else is listening and he's in</v>

1768
01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:12.220
<v Speaker 3>Las Vegas and he's a great guy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll,</v>

1769
01:12:12.270 --> 01:12:15.480
<v Speaker 3>he'll take care of you and tell you what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can and cannot expect out of this.</v>

1770
01:12:15.481 --> 01:12:17.430
<v Speaker 3>But they're going to start doing this</v>
<v Speaker 3>all over the world.</v>

1771
01:12:17.431 --> 01:12:21.000
<v Speaker 3>But I believe right now in Vegas is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>only place we can get this stuff that</v>

1772
01:12:21.001 --> 01:12:23.460
<v Speaker 3>they're doing through placenta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might be wrong about that.</v>

1773
01:12:23.730 --> 01:12:24.530
<v Speaker 3>They actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1774
01:12:24.530 --> 01:12:28.440
<v Speaker 3>they got some to a doctor in New York</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was working on a UFC fighter.</v>

1775
01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:30.720
<v Speaker 3>Chris Weidman actually had to do as nice</v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

1776
01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:33.810
<v Speaker 3>My doctor was telling me there's some</v>
<v Speaker 3>way that he was working on that day.</v>

1777
01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:36.990
<v Speaker 3>They could inject $200,</v>
<v Speaker 3>million stem cells and you at one time</v>

1778
01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:40.830
<v Speaker 3>and they basically do it once and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>works in your whole body.</v>

1779
01:12:40.831 --> 01:12:44.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how they think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but bas rutten was saying boss route and</v>

1780
01:12:44.670 --> 01:12:47.240
<v Speaker 3>had it done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me Too.</v>

1781
01:12:47.370 --> 01:12:49.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to get kicked up when</v>

1782
01:12:50.030 --> 01:12:51.920
<v Speaker 3>fucking great guy anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

1783
01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:53.580
<v Speaker 3>he had uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>done intravenously and he was like,</v>

1784
01:12:53.581 --> 01:12:55.860
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was power coming off my fingers.</v>

1785
01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:00.960
<v Speaker 3>Like I seemed amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a great guy.</v>

1786
01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:03.810
<v Speaker 3>He's a spectacular example of a human</v>
<v Speaker 3>being.</v>

1787
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:06.600
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when you're filming this documentary</v>

1788
01:13:06.601 --> 01:13:09.480
<v Speaker 3>and you're doing this and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're exposing yourself,</v>

1789
01:13:10.110 --> 01:13:12.780
<v Speaker 3>was that one of the harder parts of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>documentary because you know,</v>

1790
01:13:12.781 --> 01:13:17.660
<v Speaker 3>you had to show your car getting all</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking banged up and I mean for me,</v>

1791
01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:18.221
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1792
01:13:18.221 --> 01:13:19.920
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you take any heat for that because</v>

1793
01:13:19.921 --> 01:13:24.060
<v Speaker 3>you were driving around pilled up and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>got in trouble for that.</v>

1794
01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:24.541
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1795
01:13:24.541 --> 01:13:26.910
<v Speaker 3>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never once got pulled over.</v>

1796
01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:29.350
<v Speaker 3>I'd be hammered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You emitting,</v>

1797
01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:33.120
<v Speaker 3>you essentially admitted to a felony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

1798
01:13:33.121 --> 01:13:34.620
<v Speaker 3>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless it's like murder,</v>

1799
01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:36.630
<v Speaker 3>you can't really get convicted of</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

1800
01:13:36.631 --> 01:13:38.310
<v Speaker 3>You're saying like a documentary or a</v>
<v Speaker 3>movie?</v>

1801
01:13:38.370 --> 01:13:39.120
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1802
01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:43.110
<v Speaker 3>like I could say I never paid my taxes</v>
<v Speaker 3>in 20 years and they can look into it.</v>

1803
01:13:43.210 --> 01:13:45.100
<v Speaker 3>It might be stupid to say it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but him like,</v>

1804
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:48.030
<v Speaker 3>because we had to check that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like seriously when he was talking about</v>

1805
01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:50.730
<v Speaker 3>taking stuff away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be in this fucking</v>

1806
01:13:50.731 --> 01:13:51.540
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>

1807
01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:55.350
<v Speaker 3>What are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of our attorneys and everything</v>

<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

1809
01:13:55.951 --> 01:13:59.520
<v Speaker 3>like if he says it in documentary</v>
<v Speaker 3>entertainment way to see if ted Cruz</v>

<v Speaker 3>your retroactive.</v>

1811
01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:05.280
<v Speaker 3>I think that it's important that you did</v>
<v Speaker 3>that though,</v>

1812
01:14:05.281 --> 01:14:05.731
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

1813
01:14:05.731 --> 01:14:07.100
<v Speaker 3>it took a lot of balls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

1814
01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:10.680
<v Speaker 3>You said you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the stuff I recall him saying</v>

1815
01:14:10.681 --> 01:14:12.110
<v Speaker 3>that he was most embarrassed about</v>

1816
01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:14.410
<v Speaker 1>was just like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way he looked,</v>

1817
01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:18.760
<v Speaker 1>he cares about being fat and being</v>
<v Speaker 1>bloodshot eyes and like just looking</v>

1818
01:14:18.761 --> 01:14:21.190
<v Speaker 1>jacked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was kind of like more depressed about</v>

1819
01:14:21.191 --> 01:14:22.390
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how that came off,</v>

1820
01:14:22.391 --> 01:14:24.010
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't like watching a movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>

1821
01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:25.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's kind of some of the stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's told me.</v>

1822
01:14:25.511 --> 01:14:28.000
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've watched it like maybe four or five</v>

1823
01:14:28.001 --> 01:14:30.850
<v Speaker 1>times in its completed form for me to</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>

1824
01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:33.760
<v Speaker 1>What were you eating that you gained so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much weight?</v>

1825
01:14:33.790 --> 01:14:37.810
<v Speaker 1>Did you just like try to like whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>was kate yourself with food because your</v>

1826
01:14:37.811 --> 01:14:42.280
<v Speaker 1>pain and I actually thought it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was like getting bigger and</v>

1827
01:14:42.281 --> 01:14:44.320
<v Speaker 1>getting stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was really strong at that time,</v>

1828
01:14:44.330 --> 01:14:46.000
<v Speaker 1>like know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was like fat,</v>

1829
01:14:46.001 --> 01:14:46.930
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could still,</v>

1830
01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:50.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw up four or five for like four reps</v>

1831
01:14:50.110 --> 01:14:52.840
<v Speaker 1>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I tore my tricep and that led</v>

1832
01:14:52.841 --> 01:14:55.600
<v Speaker 1>to more depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lead to eating bad lead to less,</v>

1833
01:14:55.601 --> 01:14:57.820
<v Speaker 1>working out all sorts of Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1834
01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Well then drinking just causes waking</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

1835
01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:01.481
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking.</v>

1836
01:15:01.481 --> 01:15:04.240

<v Speaker 1>you is not good.</v>

1837
01:15:05.950 --> 01:15:08.980
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I've noticed from</v>
<v Speaker 1>this diet is I have very little alcohol</v>

1838
01:15:08.981 --> 01:15:10.540
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that I drank a lot,</v>

1839
01:15:10.541 --> 01:15:14.800
<v Speaker 1>but now I'll limit myself to maybe a</v>
<v Speaker 1>glass of wine or two in a night.</v>

1840

<v Speaker 1>At most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you on?</v>

1841
01:15:15.911 --> 01:15:17.740
<v Speaker 1>No carbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very little carbs.</v>

1842
01:15:17.770 --> 01:15:20.910
<v Speaker 1>He's joined the war on carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You joined the war on carbs,</v>

1843
01:15:21.730 --> 01:15:23.250
<v Speaker 1>carbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>

1844
01:15:23.370 --> 01:15:28.270
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do a documentary on</v>
<v Speaker 1>ketogenic diets and the owners of quest</v>

1845
01:15:28.271 --> 01:15:32.500
<v Speaker 1>nutrition to have 44 dogs at a farm in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dallas that have a very,</v>

1846
01:15:32.610 --> 01:15:37.030
<v Speaker 1>had a very aggressive form of cancer to</v>
<v Speaker 1>now all cancer free and all they're</v>

1847
01:15:37.031 --> 01:15:39.120
<v Speaker 1>doing is a ketogenic diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 dogs.</v>

1848
01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:40.210
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seventy percent,</v>

1849
01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:42.280
<v Speaker 1>Quito dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 percent fat,</v>

1850
01:15:42.281 --> 01:15:45.580
<v Speaker 1>30 percent protein turn into wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are dogs.</v>

1851
01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:46.960
<v Speaker 1>And so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is like,</v>

1852
01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:49.120
<v Speaker 1>how can we look at that and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1853
01:15:49.121 --> 01:15:51.930
<v Speaker 1>will this work in humans or what is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

1854
01:15:51.950 --> 01:15:55.360
<v Speaker 1>I think any research we're doing on any</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals that are mammals,</v>

1855
01:15:55.361 --> 01:15:58.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like kind of have similarities so we can</v>

1856
01:15:58.271 --> 01:16:00.370
<v Speaker 1>start figuring things out through these</v>
<v Speaker 1>dogs,</v>

1857
01:16:00.371 --> 01:16:02.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're not going to experiment</v>

1858
01:16:02.051 --> 01:16:03.310
<v Speaker 1>on people really now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1859
01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:04.750
<v Speaker 1>and the dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1860
01:16:04.751 --> 01:16:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to save it's life,</v>

1861
01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:07.420
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1862
01:16:07.421 --> 01:16:08.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are,</v>

1863
01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:11.050
<v Speaker 1>what are their conclusions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that ketogenetic diets,</v>

1864
01:16:11.051 --> 01:16:14.230
<v Speaker 1>I know they think that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know that it's very effective for</v>

1865
01:16:14.231 --> 01:16:17.160
<v Speaker 1>children that have epilepsy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's what I've heard.</v>

1866
01:16:17.180 --> 01:16:19.330
<v Speaker 1>I've also heard the shot down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm just going to say what I've</v>

1867
01:16:19.331 --> 01:16:21.440
<v Speaker 1>heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that a,</v>

1868
01:16:21.870 --> 01:16:24.910
<v Speaker 1>the absence of carbohydrates that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically starves the cancer cell.</v>

1869
01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:27.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if it's that simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what I've heard.</v>

1870
01:16:27.130 --> 01:16:30.880
<v Speaker 1>What carbohydrates do convert to sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially simple carbohydrates like</v>

1871
01:16:30.881 --> 01:16:35.800
<v Speaker 1>bread and pasta and sugar does fuel</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer and I had inflammation in general</v>

1872
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:39.010
<v Speaker 1>in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel fantastic.</v>

1873
01:16:39.011 --> 01:16:43.360
<v Speaker 1>I've only been doing this a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This diet is a primal blueprint.</v>

1874
01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:45.490
<v Speaker 1>Ketogenic Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've only been doing it for a month,</v>

1875
01:16:45.491 --> 01:16:48.610
<v Speaker 1>but my brain is the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when we were talking about before</v>

1876
01:16:48.611 --> 01:16:51.610
<v Speaker 1>the podcast started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably the most interesting</v>

1877
01:16:51.611 --> 01:16:54.190
<v Speaker 1>aspect of it is the mental clarity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a book,</v>

1878
01:16:54.191 --> 01:16:55.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mark Sussan.</v>

1879
01:16:55.150 --> 01:16:56.430
<v Speaker 1>He's got a couple of books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1880
01:16:56.560 --> 01:17:00.610
<v Speaker 1>the primal blueprint and I think I</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget where are they in the other room?</v>

1881
01:17:00.970 --> 01:17:01.803
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love.</v>

1882
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.980
<v Speaker 1>I just love reading all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have read every ketogenic diet book.</v>

1883
01:17:05.981 --> 01:17:06.780
<v Speaker 1>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm gonna.</v>

1884
01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:08.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna get that after we get off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>air.</v>

1885
01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:10.160
<v Speaker 1>I tried gluten free for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did</v>

1886
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.070
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lost weight and I got thinner,</v>

1887
01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:13.470
<v Speaker 3>like my face got thinner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my,</v>

1888
01:17:13.510 --> 01:17:16.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of those guys are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my fucking head gets fat.</v>

1889
01:17:16.570 --> 01:17:20.110
<v Speaker 3>And so the first thing that happens when</v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

1890
01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:25.160
<v Speaker 3>my face gets round in big and this park</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fact and have abs and have the</v>

1891
01:17:25.161 --> 01:17:29.150
<v Speaker 3>fattest face you ever seen the fat face</v>
<v Speaker 3>things a weird thing.</v>

1892
01:17:29.450 --> 01:17:31.220
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the first thing that I noticed</v>

1893
01:17:31.221 --> 01:17:35.030
<v Speaker 3>when I did the gluten free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My face shrank down to normal size and</v>

1894
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:38.390
<v Speaker 3>this is even more so like gluten free is</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

1895
01:17:38.391 --> 01:17:40.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very controversial.</v>

1896
01:17:40.131 --> 01:17:41.750
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy who came up with the whole</v>

1897
01:17:41.751 --> 01:17:44.200
<v Speaker 3>gluten free thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>published a letter,</v>

1898
01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:47.030
<v Speaker 3>published a retraction three years</v>
<v Speaker 3>later,</v>

1899
01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:49.250
<v Speaker 3>says that I lied.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was wrong.</v>

1900
01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:50.630
<v Speaker 3>No gluten free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1901
01:17:50.631 --> 01:17:52.360
<v Speaker 3>here's what is definitely like a big</v>
<v Speaker 3>contract,</v>

1902
01:17:52.530 --> 01:17:54.430
<v Speaker 3>like big debate over it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess so.</v>

1903
01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:55.910
<v Speaker 3>But here's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1904
01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.600
<v Speaker 3>this is why what I decided is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons why I stopped being gluten free.</v>

1905
01:17:59.950 --> 01:18:01.100
<v Speaker 3>What it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it is,</v>

1906
01:18:01.101 --> 01:18:04.040
<v Speaker 3>is you're taking less sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what the benefit was.</v>

1907
01:18:04.041 --> 01:18:06.110
<v Speaker 3>The benefit was I wasn't even eating any</v>
<v Speaker 3>bread,</v>

1908
01:18:06.111 --> 01:18:08.930
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't eating any pasta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was taking in less sugar.</v>

1909
01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:11.450
<v Speaker 3>It's really that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's less inflammation,</v>

1910
01:18:11.451 --> 01:18:13.670
<v Speaker 3>so I felt better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it definitely worked.</v>

1911
01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:15.350
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're adhering to a program that just</v>

1912
01:18:15.351 --> 01:18:17.900
<v Speaker 3>gets rid of some junk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not a huge.</v>

1913
01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:19.760
<v Speaker 3>What are you eating on the primal</v>
<v Speaker 3>blueprint?</v>

1914
01:18:19.790 --> 01:18:23.180
<v Speaker 3>I eat a lot of Avocados.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm meeting a lot of healthy fats.</v>

1915
01:18:23.181 --> 01:18:24.014
<v Speaker 3>I take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1916
01:18:24.190 --> 01:18:27.980
<v Speaker 3>mct oil of take these ketones that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>saw over here.</v>

1917
01:18:28.590 --> 01:18:31.640
<v Speaker 3>These things are mixed these into water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are ketones.</v>

1918
01:18:31.730 --> 01:18:34.580
<v Speaker 3>I got a stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a kito protein coming out pretty soon.</v>

1919
01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:38.360
<v Speaker 3>I'll send you some.</v>

1920
01:18:38.361 --> 01:18:39.890
<v Speaker 3>in coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mix It in coffee.</v>

1921
01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:43.400
<v Speaker 3>That's a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could put exogenous ketones in coffee</v>

1922
01:18:43.401 --> 01:18:44.240
<v Speaker 3>and then there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>convenient when you're doing these kinds</v>

<v Speaker 3>up fucking pound of meat every five</v>

1935
01:19:11.031 --> 01:19:12.260
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1936
01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:14.600

<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

1938
01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:21.050
<v Speaker 3>elks that are shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you need fats on top of that and a</v>

1939
01:19:21.051 --> 01:19:25.130
<v Speaker 3>lot of that elk is like really a lean</v>
<v Speaker 3>fat to it,</v>

1940
01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:25.973
<v Speaker 3>correct?</v>

1941
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:26.511
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1942
01:19:26.511 --> 01:19:30.200
<v Speaker 3>you don't add fat to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean it's not the same as like say</v>

1943
01:19:30.201 --> 01:19:32.270
<v Speaker 3>if you get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1944
01:19:32.271 --> 01:19:36.490
<v Speaker 3>if you got to like a beef steak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a rib eye or something like that,</v>

1945
01:19:36.491 --> 01:19:39.230
<v Speaker 3>you're getting a lot of fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if it's a corn fed.</v>

1946
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:44.000
<v Speaker 3>Beef steak is a lot of fat and so I take</v>
<v Speaker 3>different kinds of fats,</v>

1947
01:19:44.001 --> 01:19:46.610
<v Speaker 3>but avocado is one of the primary ones</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I like.</v>

1948
01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:49.580
<v Speaker 3>Ketogenic diets are amazing for a losing</v>
<v Speaker 3>weight,</v>

1949
01:19:49.610 --> 01:19:53.140
<v Speaker 3>for a weight class type stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 3>powerlifting,</v>

1950
01:19:53.150 --> 01:19:54.710
<v Speaker 3>weightlifting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mma,</v>

1951
01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:56.690
<v Speaker 3>it works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>works fucking awesome.</v>

1952
01:19:56.691 --> 01:19:58.550
<v Speaker 3>You can drop a couple pounds pretty</v>
<v Speaker 3>quickly.</v>

1953
01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:02.000
<v Speaker 3>You've got to wet your body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really get accustomed to it though,</v>

1954
01:20:02.001 --> 01:20:06.950
<v Speaker 3>because in the beginning people shy off</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it because they feel like losing that</v>

1955
01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 3>weight makes them feel</v>

1956
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:12.980
<v Speaker 1>weak and changing from a carbohydrate</v>
<v Speaker 1>consuming body to approach or to a body.</v>

1957
01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:17.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does take time.</v>

1958
01:20:17.290 --> 01:20:19.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like any cheat day.</v>

1959
01:20:19.830 --> 01:20:21.210
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1960
01:20:21.211 --> 01:20:25.020
<v Speaker 1>In the month I have done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just just decide that I don't eat that</v>

1961
01:20:25.021 --> 01:20:26.620
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1962
01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:29.250
<v Speaker 1>I gave myself 60 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of six days,</v>

1963
01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:32.840
<v Speaker 1>maybe we'll have some ice cream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think I'm going right back on the</v>

1964
01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:33.770
<v Speaker 1>ice cream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1965
01:20:33.770 --> 01:20:34.950
<v Speaker 1>Did that improve ice cream?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1966
01:20:35.150 --> 01:20:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>

1967
01:20:36.450 --> 01:20:40.200
<v Speaker 1>They sell it at Erewhon bulletproof ice</v>
<v Speaker 1>cream and it's like I'm not buying any</v>

1968
01:20:40.201 --> 01:20:45.000
<v Speaker 1>bulletproof stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that guy kind of carb</v>

1969
01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:47.490
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want that guy's just too full of shit</v>

1970
01:20:47.491 --> 01:20:49.350
<v Speaker 1>about too many different things for me</v>
<v Speaker 1>to support it.</v>

1971
01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:53.550
<v Speaker 1>The one thing that carbohydrates do is</v>
<v Speaker 1>they help to hydrate carbohydrate,</v>

1972
01:20:53.551 --> 01:20:57.090
<v Speaker 1>helps hydrate the muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what's I think sometimes like</v>

1973
01:20:57.300 --> 01:20:59.460
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people will will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1974
01:20:59.461 --> 01:21:03.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't like Kito Kito Diet because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel weak because I lose energy.</v>

1975
01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:07.800
<v Speaker 1>If you're doing a Keto diet properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should not be losing any energy.</v>

1976
01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:11.340
<v Speaker 1>Your energy level should be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However you're not gonna have as much</v>

1977
01:21:11.341 --> 01:21:14.520
<v Speaker 1>water through your muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a strength athlete or</v>

1978
01:21:14.521 --> 01:21:17.520
<v Speaker 1>somebody that relies on the strength,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be compromised a little bit,</v>

1979
01:21:17.521 --> 01:21:20.450
<v Speaker 1>especially when you start to lose</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like over like 10 pounds.</v>

1980
01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:23.040
<v Speaker 1>So there's going to be calm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You lose a lot of weight,</v>

1981
01:21:23.041 --> 01:21:25.260
<v Speaker 1>your strengths can be compromised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to make sure that you're</v>

1982
01:21:25.261 --> 01:21:26.980
<v Speaker 1>hydrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to make sure that you're,</v>

1983
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:29.060
<v Speaker 1>and you've got to make sure you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>

1984
01:21:29.630 --> 01:21:31.800
<v Speaker 1>need some carbohydrates here and there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1985
01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:32.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1986
01:21:33.210 --> 01:21:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Harbert's you don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want high.</v>

1987
01:21:35.550 --> 01:21:36.540
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is.</v>

1988
01:21:36.570 --> 01:21:37.460
<v Speaker 1>And you look at like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1989
01:21:37.470 --> 01:21:41.550
<v Speaker 1>conor mcgregor going up a weight class</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know there's different fighters</v>

1990
01:21:41.551 --> 01:21:43.380
<v Speaker 1>and different styles and all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>different things,</v>

1991
01:21:43.381 --> 01:21:46.110
<v Speaker 1>but it is hard to overcome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1992
01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:47.880
<v Speaker 1>someone just being being bigger than</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1993
01:21:47.910 --> 01:21:50.760
<v Speaker 1>And so if you lose a bunch of weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should expect to lose some strength.</v>

1994
01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.440
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the girl's name is Marisha,</v>

1995
01:21:52.441 --> 01:21:55.380
<v Speaker 1>new to s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>h e n fact,</v>

1996
01:21:55.540 --> 01:22:00.540
<v Speaker 1>putting Paleo chef know phat fudge fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paleo chef.com I think is a.</v>

1997
01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:02.730
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a website.</v>

1998
01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:03.401
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1999
01:22:03.401 --> 01:22:07.010
<v Speaker 1>the product's called phat fudge and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully we're going to start selling</v>

2000
01:22:07.011 --> 01:22:09.240
<v Speaker 1>it on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just buy the whole company.</v>

2001
01:22:09.850 --> 01:22:12.290
<v Speaker 1>That sounds nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

2002
01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:13.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

2003

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's healthy.</v>

2004
01:22:14.521 --> 01:22:17.630
<v Speaker 1>It's good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a key to genic right?</v>

2005
01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:20.640
<v Speaker 1>The whole idea for me was just to just</v>
<v Speaker 1>give it a try,</v>

2006
01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:23.370
<v Speaker 1>just see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see what it's really like it.</v>

2007
01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:24.353
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2008
01:22:24.450 --> 01:22:29.190
<v Speaker 1>it gets me in a mode where I feel like</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything come becomes an order or when</v>

2009
01:22:29.191 --> 01:22:30.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm on like a ketogenic diet for some</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason I'm like,</v>

2010
01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:33.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm not on it right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I get on it I'm like,</v>

2011
01:22:33.751 --> 01:22:35.820
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know exactly what I need to do exactly</v>

2012
01:22:35.821 --> 01:22:36.654
<v Speaker 1>what I need to eat.</v>

2013
01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:39.270
<v Speaker 1>I kind of liked the structure of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2014
01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:42.520
<v Speaker 1>And it's not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a lot of people are worried about</v>

2015
01:22:42.521 --> 01:22:42.990
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2016
01:22:42.990 --> 01:22:44.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only eat carbs.</v>

2017
01:22:44.821 --> 01:22:47.250
<v Speaker 1>And when people start panicking and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start coming up,</v>

2018
01:22:47.251 --> 01:22:49.130
<v Speaker 1>well I heard that it makes your Dick</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall off.</v>

2019
01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Come up with so many different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many lies about stupid thing.</v>

2020
01:22:52.201 --> 01:22:53.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not good for you.</v>

2021
01:22:53.210 --> 01:22:57.300
<v Speaker 1>It's a day where your brain runs on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carbohydrates are bad for me,</v>

2022
01:22:57.330 --> 01:22:58.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's not proven.</v>

2023
01:22:58.450 --> 01:22:59.440
<v Speaker 1>It's good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm</v>

2024
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:04.260
<v Speaker 1>guessing just armbar those people can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>

2025
01:23:04.370 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a day where you throw in any</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbs are</v>

2026
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:07.000
<v Speaker 3>not really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2027
01:23:07.370 --> 01:23:10.600
<v Speaker 3>Just maybe vegetables and nuts and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that of that.</v>

2028
01:23:10.660 --> 01:23:14.440
<v Speaker 3>But my thought behind it was I just want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to try it,</v>

2029
01:23:14.610 --> 01:23:16.930
<v Speaker 3>see what it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying the exact way it's meant to be.</v>

2030
01:23:16.990 --> 01:23:21.990
<v Speaker 3>And what sits in is the idea behind is</v>
<v Speaker 3>not Paleo because that word Paleo</v>

2031
01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:24.880
<v Speaker 3>Lithic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what's kind of messed up</v>

2032
01:23:24.881 --> 01:23:27.100
<v Speaker 3>because the Paleolithic era,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people eat breads,</v>

2033
01:23:27.730 --> 01:23:29.140
<v Speaker 3>they grains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did.</v>

2034
01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:32.800
<v Speaker 3>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he calls it primal and the ideas just</v>

2035
01:23:32.801 --> 01:23:35.920
<v Speaker 3>eat stuff that your body is just really</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of designed to eat.</v>

2036
01:23:35.921 --> 01:23:39.250
<v Speaker 3>Your body's designed to eat fats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body's designed to eat vegetables.</v>

2037
01:23:39.550 --> 01:23:43.870
<v Speaker 3>And fats are important because when</v>
<v Speaker 3>people burn fat,</v>

2038
01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:46.920
<v Speaker 3>if you don't have those fats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you're not consuming them and</v>

2039
01:23:46.930 --> 01:23:50.680
<v Speaker 3>your body starts burning hormone profile</v>
<v Speaker 3>is hugely.</v>

2040
01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:52.240
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by fats,</v>

2041
01:23:52.241 --> 01:23:55.930
<v Speaker 3>you know there's a difference between if</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body's designed to burn</v>

2042
01:23:55.931 --> 01:23:57.310
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates,</v>

2043
01:23:57.311 --> 01:23:59.320
<v Speaker 3>if it doesn't have any carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you crash.</v>

2044
01:23:59.590 --> 01:24:02.020
<v Speaker 3>So that's the dish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a big difference too.</v>

2045
01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:04.570
<v Speaker 3>Like the feeling that I get in between</v>
<v Speaker 3>meals,</v>

2046
01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:06.190
<v Speaker 3>like I don't get the same kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>hungry,</v>

2047
01:24:06.490 --> 01:24:09.280
<v Speaker 3>like the hungry that I was getting when</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was eating a lot of carbs.</v>

2048
01:24:09.490 --> 01:24:10.600
<v Speaker 3>I'll get this off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>

2049
01:24:10.601 --> 01:24:12.070
<v Speaker 3>I got to eat now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to eat out.</v>

2050
01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:16.240
<v Speaker 3>I do not get that now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't get that week crashed feeling</v>

2051
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:19.960
<v Speaker 3>like I can get up in the morning after</v>
<v Speaker 3>not having eaten since like 8:00 at</v>

2052
01:24:19.961 --> 01:24:22.240
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd get up at 9:00 in the morning and</v>

2053
01:24:22.241 --> 01:24:24.660
<v Speaker 3>I'll lift weights and I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel weak.</v>

2054
01:24:24.870 --> 01:24:25.703
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

2055
01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:29.500
<v Speaker 3>that's unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That feels weird to not have the same</v>

2056
01:24:29.501 --> 01:24:33.240
<v Speaker 3>hunger cravings because your body's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your body regulates itself better as</v>

2057
01:24:33.250 --> 01:24:35.590
<v Speaker 3>burns off your fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing this for a long time,</v>

2058
01:24:35.591 --> 01:24:40.200
<v Speaker 3>so back in 1995 I moved to California to</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to USC,</v>

2059
01:24:40.450 --> 01:24:43.390
<v Speaker 3>started training at Gold's gym in Venice</v>
<v Speaker 3>and started trading with Michael Hern</v>

2060
01:24:43.690 --> 01:24:46.120
<v Speaker 3>and this other guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ron fed co who's getting his phd.</v>

2061
01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:48.390
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So go to the gym and these guys are a</v>

2062
01:24:48.391 --> 01:24:51.490
<v Speaker 3>lot stronger than me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their squat and 7,800 pounds and I'm</v>

2063
01:24:51.491 --> 01:24:54.250
<v Speaker 3>around the 600 pound mark and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically said,</v>

2064
01:24:54.251 --> 01:24:55.090
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're too fat.</v>

2065
01:24:55.210 --> 01:24:56.530
<v Speaker 3>You got to lose weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to be.</v>

2066
01:24:56.770 --> 01:24:59.840
<v Speaker 3>You can't be competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to drop to next class.</v>

2067
01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:01.660
<v Speaker 3>You need to be in the one nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight weight class.</v>

2068
01:25:01.670 --> 01:25:03.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea how to do that and I'm</v>

2069
01:25:03.521 --> 01:25:05.170
<v Speaker 3>just a kid from poughkeepsie that moved</v>
<v Speaker 3>out here.</v>

2070
01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:07.510
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea what the bodybuilding</v>
<v Speaker 3>lifestyle is about.</v>

2071
01:25:07.511 --> 01:25:08.830
<v Speaker 3>Anything and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2072
01:25:08.831 --> 01:25:12.220
<v Speaker 3>just eat red meat and water until your</v>
<v Speaker 3>account until what?</v>

2073
01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:14.200
<v Speaker 3>Red Meat and water shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did that for.</v>

2074
01:25:14.201 --> 01:25:16.040
<v Speaker 3>I did that for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2075
01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:16.931
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

2076
01:25:16.931 --> 01:25:20.410
<v Speaker 3>When I came back from New York to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>back to school and lift with these guys</v>

2077
01:25:20.411 --> 01:25:24.250
<v Speaker 3>again after the summer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I weighed one 96 and so I came</v>

2078
01:25:24.251 --> 01:25:24.390
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

2079
01:25:24.390 --> 01:25:24.731
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2080
01:25:24.731 --> 01:25:27.250
<v Speaker 3>you did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was kind of stupid.</v>

2081
01:25:27.251 --> 01:25:30.070
<v Speaker 3>Says vegetables were fair game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said if you really die and you could</v>

2082
01:25:30.071 --> 01:25:31.720
<v Speaker 3>have like an apple here or there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

2083
01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:35.110
<v Speaker 3>it was basically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I was naive.</v>

2084
01:25:35.111 --> 01:25:37.080
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know and that was kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>good thing for me because I just,</v>

2085
01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:40.750
<v Speaker 3>I just dove in headfirst and I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>take away your shit's like.</v>

2086
01:25:40.751 --> 01:25:44.740
<v Speaker 3>And how often they come out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every four or five days he lift up a</v>

2087
01:25:44.741 --> 01:25:46.600
<v Speaker 3>manhole cover and just take a shit right</v>
<v Speaker 3>in there.</v>

2088
01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:49.180
<v Speaker 3>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was fine,</v>

2089
01:25:49.181 --> 01:25:52.240
<v Speaker 3>I was stronger and I went into me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I squatted 6:59.</v>

2090
01:25:52.241 --> 01:25:55.990
<v Speaker 3>Why did you stop eating like that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think it sustainable</v>

2091
01:25:55.991 --> 01:25:56.830
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2092
01:25:56.890 --> 01:26:01.890
<v Speaker 3>I think that's one of the issues that</v>
<v Speaker 3>Quito guy as it gets to be hard to do</v>

2093
01:26:02.051 --> 01:26:04.100
<v Speaker 3>for really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really long like yours,</v>

2094
01:26:04.370 --> 01:26:05.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just gets to be tough.</v>

2095
01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:08.780
<v Speaker 1>You mean psychological and you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just run into roadblocks here and</v>

2096
01:26:08.781 --> 01:26:10.340
<v Speaker 1>there and then you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get triggers,</v>

2097
01:26:10.341 --> 01:26:11.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for food,</v>

2098
01:26:11.690 --> 01:26:13.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody has fucking birthday and then</v>

2099
01:26:13.581 --> 01:26:16.400
<v Speaker 1>they are eating birthday cake and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>just kind of snowball and you might end</v>

2100
01:26:16.401 --> 01:26:18.920
<v Speaker 1>up into something else or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might,</v>

2101
01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:22.490
<v Speaker 1>depending on what sport you're into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have different goals at</v>

2102
01:26:22.491 --> 01:26:25.190
<v Speaker 1>different periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes you want to be small and</v>

2103
01:26:25.191 --> 01:26:30.170
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you want to be bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you say roadblocks you don't</v>

2104
01:26:30.171 --> 01:26:33.150
<v Speaker 1>mean like you mean more psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2105
01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:33.621
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2106
01:26:33.621 --> 01:26:34.730
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Diet's fine,</v>

2107
01:26:35.020 --> 01:26:38.240
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to like have some sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of weird blood issue or anything like</v>

2108
01:26:38.241 --> 01:26:40.220
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think I'm going to give myself a</v>

2109
01:26:40.221 --> 01:26:43.160
<v Speaker 1>cheat day every couple of months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I think I'm going to do it</v>

2110
01:26:43.450 --> 01:26:45.950
<v Speaker 1>was one day you have an amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2111
01:26:45.970 --> 01:26:46.940
<v Speaker 1>iron will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2112
01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:47.900
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people don't have that.</v>

2113
01:26:47.930 --> 01:26:49.430
<v Speaker 1>It's not that hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2114
01:26:49.460 --> 01:26:51.830
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's kids in Ethiopia right now.</v>

2115
01:26:51.831 --> 01:26:53.720
<v Speaker 1>They don't have any feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2116
01:26:53.721 --> 01:26:54.360
<v Speaker 1>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2117
01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:59.360
<v Speaker 1>how hard is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elk steaks and sauteed Kale and fresh</v>

2118
01:26:59.511 --> 01:27:01.950
<v Speaker 1>eggs and Avocados.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all great.</v>

2119
01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:04.270
<v Speaker 1>You have your own chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2120
01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:07.220
<v Speaker 1>It's all I feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm gonna stick with it.</v>

2121
01:27:07.221 --> 01:27:08.780
<v Speaker 1>I really think this might be the way I</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat.</v>

2122
01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:11.600
<v Speaker 1>People are so annoyed with me though</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I talk about it too much.</v>

2123
01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:14.120
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the best way to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've always,</v>

2124
01:27:14.180 --> 01:27:15.110
<v Speaker 1>we've always thought that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2125
01:27:15.170 --> 01:27:16.040
<v Speaker 1>we have a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2126
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:19.310
<v Speaker 1>John Anderson who hasn't eaten</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates and years.</v>

2127
01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:20.900
<v Speaker 1>No cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no cars.</v>

2128
01:27:20.930 --> 01:27:22.050
<v Speaker 1>He's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has,</v>

2129
01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:26.450
<v Speaker 1>well not no carbs as he as he likes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it,</v>

2130
01:27:26.451 --> 01:27:28.010
<v Speaker 1>those little motherfuckers are</v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

2131
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:31.880
<v Speaker 1>Carbohydrates are in everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he pretty much despises the act of</v>

2132
01:27:31.881 --> 01:27:35.120
<v Speaker 1>like actually sitting down and eating</v>
<v Speaker 1>like rice or eating potatoes.</v>

2133
01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:36.680
<v Speaker 1>Really huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good.</v>

2134
01:27:36.710 --> 01:27:38.690
<v Speaker 1>He used to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know he used to do strong man</v>

2135
01:27:38.691 --> 01:27:41.810
<v Speaker 1>competitions and he said we did strong</v>
<v Speaker 1>man competitions.</v>

2136
01:27:41.811 --> 01:27:44.720
<v Speaker 1>The turnover rate from going from one</v>
<v Speaker 1>event to the next.</v>

2137
01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:46.610
<v Speaker 1>He had to eat carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2138
01:27:46.611 --> 01:27:49.910
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said that once he retired from strong</v>

2139
01:27:49.911 --> 01:27:52.520
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he were strength wasn't his main focus</v>

2140
01:27:52.521 --> 01:27:53.151
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2141
01:27:53.151 --> 01:27:56.030
<v Speaker 1>I get rid of all that shit and I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically just eat meat and vegetables</v>

2142
01:27:56.050 --> 01:28:00.140
<v Speaker 1>and like bodybuilding diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a lot of carbohydrates in it</v>

2143
01:28:00.141 --> 01:28:02.480
<v Speaker 1>and they stuffed themselves to put on</v>
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>

2144
01:28:02.481 --> 01:28:05.120
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And John Anderson continue to get bigger</v>

2145
01:28:05.121 --> 01:28:07.010
<v Speaker 1>and stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not gonna you're not gonna.</v>

2146
01:28:07.070 --> 01:28:10.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can win like Mr</v>
<v Speaker 1>Olympia without carbohydrates because I</v>

2147
01:28:10.521 --> 01:28:13.850
<v Speaker 1>think there's a whole thing to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hormones of the insulation and</v>

2148
01:28:13.851 --> 01:28:16.190
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a whole thing is way too</v>

2149
01:28:16.191 --> 01:28:19.340
<v Speaker 1>complicated for me to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just don't think you can.</v>

2150
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:23.240
<v Speaker 1>I think you're limited whenever you</v>
<v Speaker 1>limit any macro macronutrient,</v>

2151
01:28:23.241 --> 01:28:24.940
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to have some</v>
<v Speaker 1>limitations probably,</v>

2152
01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:26.180
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2153
01:28:26.181 --> 01:28:29.840
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting situation where</v>

2154
01:28:29.841 --> 01:28:33.440
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to figure out what's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best stuff to put into your body to get</v>

2155
01:28:33.441 --> 01:28:35.540
<v Speaker 1>the best performance and the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling out of it.</v>

2156
01:28:35.541 --> 01:28:38.530
<v Speaker 1>And then you factor in convenience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2157
01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:42.380
<v Speaker 1>social things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>customer things like someone actually</v>

2158
01:28:42.381 --> 01:28:45.430
<v Speaker 1>doing like a know mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a competitor.</v>

2159
01:28:45.610 --> 01:28:47.510
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd probably be a mistake to completely</v>

2160
01:28:47.511 --> 01:28:48.860
<v Speaker 1>get rid of the carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

2161
01:28:48.890 --> 01:28:52.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess the main question would be um,</v>

2162
01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:55.040
<v Speaker 1>if it's to lose weight to get to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next weight class and it would be</v>

2163
01:28:55.041 --> 01:28:56.660
<v Speaker 1>something that you do for a period of</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

2164
01:28:57.110 --> 01:28:59.810
<v Speaker 1>but if other athletes are successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the carbohydrates in there,</v>

2165
01:28:59.811 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't you just utilize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some guys have gone</v>

2166
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:03.870
<v Speaker 3>Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They try to go Vegan to lose weight.</v>

2167
01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:05.430
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>say it.</v>

2169
01:29:09.751 --> 01:29:13.470
<v Speaker 3>Don't say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To keep tweeting me and instagram me</v>

2170
01:29:13.471 --> 01:29:15.600
<v Speaker 3>about Nate Diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not Vegan,</v>

2171
01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:18.040
<v Speaker 3>so stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just cut the shit.</v>

2172
01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:18.860
<v Speaker 3>Mercedes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vegan.</v>

2173
01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:20.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These vegans went crazy.</v>

2174
01:29:20.870 --> 01:29:23.970
<v Speaker 3>Does it feel to know a Vegan is the best</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighter in the world?</v>

2175
01:29:23.971 --> 01:29:27.360
<v Speaker 3>You got beat by a Vegan and the v.</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all jumped on the Vegan bag.</v>

2176
01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:28.530
<v Speaker 3>He eats fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Fox.</v>

2177
01:29:28.670 --> 01:29:30.250
<v Speaker 3>He eats eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need search.</v>

2178
01:29:30.930 --> 01:29:34.440
<v Speaker 3>He likes green plants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good for you.</v>

2179
01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:36.030
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>green plants are very good for you,</v>

2180
01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:40.230
<v Speaker 3>but you say that in your comedy cult</v>
<v Speaker 3>attached to these people.</v>

2181
01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:44.610
<v Speaker 3>They're so unbelievably proselytizing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just ridiculous.</v>

2182
01:29:44.611 --> 01:29:47.520
<v Speaker 3>What they don't realize too is if I have</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends that are Vegan and they never</v>

2183
01:29:47.521 --> 01:29:49.710
<v Speaker 3>talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they never pushed it on me and I'm</v>

2184
01:29:49.711 --> 01:29:51.330
<v Speaker 3>actually interested in finding out why</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2185
01:29:51.420 --> 01:29:52.830
<v Speaker 3>why they want to do that.</v>

2186
01:29:52.830 --> 01:29:54.180
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I asked them about it.</v>

2187
01:29:54.181 --> 01:29:55.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're not pushing it down my</v>

2188
01:29:55.861 --> 01:29:56.430
<v Speaker 3>throat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2189
01:29:56.430 --> 01:29:59.850
<v Speaker 3>most of what nate eats is raw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He eats a lot of raw foods and you did</v>

2190
01:29:59.851 --> 01:30:02.090
<v Speaker 3>that for a long time and he tried raw</v>
<v Speaker 3>vegan for awhile,</v>

2191
01:30:02.130 --> 01:30:06.150
<v Speaker 3>but he felt like he needed to substitute</v>
<v Speaker 3>it with chicken or with a fish,</v>

2192
01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:09.780
<v Speaker 3>so he doesn't need any land animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he does eat eggs,</v>

2193
01:30:09.781 --> 01:30:10.680
<v Speaker 3>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty sure.</v>

2194
01:30:10.681 --> 01:30:13.680
<v Speaker 3>I know he eats breads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen him eat like tacos and shit.</v>

2195
01:30:13.681 --> 01:30:16.590
<v Speaker 3>So He's eating tortillas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was fucking awesome in that fight.</v>

2196
01:30:16.610 --> 01:30:18.870
<v Speaker 3>A bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the reason why he won,</v>

2197
01:30:18.871 --> 01:30:20.640
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not because he's a fucking Vegan.</v>

2198
01:30:20.641 --> 01:30:24.000
<v Speaker 3>You assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's healthy and he's got very good</v>

2199
01:30:24.001 --> 01:30:26.490
<v Speaker 3>endurance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got a really good endurance base and</v>

2200
01:30:26.491 --> 01:30:28.200
<v Speaker 3>he's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a really good boxer man.</v>

2201
01:30:28.201 --> 01:30:31.170
<v Speaker 3>His boxing is nasty and his Jujitsu is</v>
<v Speaker 3>top notch.</v>

2202
01:30:31.370 --> 01:30:33.810
<v Speaker 3>Nate Diaz has been around for a long</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2203
01:30:33.811 --> 01:30:38.100
<v Speaker 3>He's 20 some odd fights in the UFC</v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker and all you vegan folks.</v>

2204
01:30:38.101 --> 01:30:40.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm not mad at you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not honestly.</v>

2205
01:30:40.111 --> 01:30:42.000
<v Speaker 3>It's just you got to understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2206
01:30:42.140 --> 01:30:45.990
<v Speaker 3>that thing that you guys do where you go</v>

2207
01:30:45.991 --> 01:30:50.991

<v Speaker 3>makes people more reluctant to associate</v>

2208
01:30:51.631 --> 01:30:53.220
<v Speaker 3>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To want to be a Vegan,</v>

2209
01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:56.970
<v Speaker 3>it makes people more with locked and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes me peep people.</v>

2210
01:30:56.971 --> 01:30:59.940
<v Speaker 3>Let's think you're ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're in a cult.</v>

2211
01:30:59.950 --> 01:31:03.630
<v Speaker 3>They're looking to religion and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>like trying to get other people to</v>

<v Speaker 3>which comes from animals.</v>

2277
01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:40.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know people that are on Vegan</v>

2278
01:33:40.091 --> 01:33:41.350
<v Speaker 3>diets that are also very healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2279
01:33:41.351 --> 01:33:43.480
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing it the right way.</v>

2280
01:33:43.481 --> 01:33:48.100
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's got to be diligent and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's also biodiversity where some</v>

2281
01:33:48.101 --> 01:33:50.380
<v Speaker 3>people works better than it does for</v>
<v Speaker 3>other people.</v>

2282
01:33:50.381 --> 01:33:53.770
<v Speaker 3>I know John fits try a Vegan diet for</v>
<v Speaker 3>awhile and it helped him for a little</v>

2283
01:33:53.771 --> 01:33:56.770
<v Speaker 3>while,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then after awhile he just felt weak.</v>

2284
01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:59.650
<v Speaker 3>Like initially it helped him a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you felt like you had more</v>

2285
01:33:59.651 --> 01:34:02.890
<v Speaker 3>endurance and he felt healthier but</v>
<v Speaker 3>slowly but surely he felt weaker and</v>

2286
01:34:02.891 --> 01:34:07.891
<v Speaker 3>weaker and then he just didn't feel like</v>
<v Speaker 3>he could compete at one 70 without</v>

2287
01:34:08.110 --> 01:34:10.480
<v Speaker 3>eating some sort of animal protein.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

2288
01:34:10.481 --> 01:34:13.810
<v Speaker 3>you can get animal protein if you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>worried about the ethical consequences</v>

2289
01:34:13.811 --> 01:34:14.644
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>

2290
01:34:15.190 --> 01:34:17.470
<v Speaker 3>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could get it from eggs and you don't</v>

2291
01:34:17.471 --> 01:34:19.630
<v Speaker 3>have to hurt anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I have eggs,</v>

2292
01:34:19.690 --> 01:34:21.370
<v Speaker 3>these chickens there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their pets.</v>

2293
01:34:21.371 --> 01:34:22.960
<v Speaker 3>I could walk up to them and pick them</v>
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>

2294
01:34:23.350 --> 01:34:24.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're not,</v>

2295
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:25.750
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to harm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not.</v>

2296
01:34:25.751 --> 01:34:29.080
<v Speaker 3>There's no factory farms situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have a backyard you can have</v>

2297
01:34:29.081 --> 01:34:30.370
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they free range,</v>

2298
01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:32.650
<v Speaker 3>they walk around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you're going to have to deal</v>

2299
01:34:32.651 --> 01:34:36.580
<v Speaker 3>with the fact they eat bugs and if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>see something that says vegetarian fed</v>

2300
01:34:36.581 --> 01:34:38.590
<v Speaker 3>chickens with those poor fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>chickens,</v>

2301
01:34:38.591 --> 01:34:41.620
<v Speaker 3>it's not their idea they want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to eat everything.</v>

2302
01:34:41.650 --> 01:34:44.080
<v Speaker 3>Those are the motherfuckers really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fed him a mouse wants,</v>

2303
01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:49.450
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That episode where they're seeing my</v>

2304
01:34:49.451 --> 01:34:53.940
<v Speaker 3>kids weren't there for the finale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chicken sacrifice will.</v>

2305
01:34:53.950 --> 01:34:58.490
<v Speaker 3>So it was sort of highlights how crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are when it comes to animals in</v>

2306
01:34:58.620 --> 01:35:01.400
<v Speaker 3>the hierarchy of what's okay to live and</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's okay to die.</v>

2307
01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:06.530
<v Speaker 3>We bought these pinkies for a hawk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hawk flew into a window and got</v>

2308
01:35:06.531 --> 01:35:10.550
<v Speaker 3>knocked the fuck out and hurt its wing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we had to bring the Hawk to one</v>

2309
01:35:10.551 --> 01:35:13.310
<v Speaker 3>of those wildlife rescue places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so in the meantime,</v>

2310
01:35:13.311 --> 01:35:15.860
<v Speaker 3>this poor hawke was with us for a day</v>
<v Speaker 3>over the weekend.</v>

2311
01:35:15.861 --> 01:35:19.380
<v Speaker 3>We got to get some food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my family went to pet food,</v>

2312
01:35:19.381 --> 01:35:21.920
<v Speaker 3>stop and got these pinkies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These mice,</v>

2313
01:35:21.921 --> 01:35:25.010
<v Speaker 3>they feed to snakes and they're like</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically the little babies,</v>

2314
01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:27.560
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of fucked up and you feed them</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the Hawk and that's what kept the</v>

2315
01:35:27.561 --> 01:35:30.410
<v Speaker 3>Hawk alive while we had them and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's happy like,</v>

2316
01:35:30.411 --> 01:35:32.160
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hawks still okie dokie amount,</v>

2317
01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:34.880
<v Speaker 3>but then there was this one mouse left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My wife,</v>

2318
01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:36.620
<v Speaker 3>my daughter wanted to keep it as a pet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2319
01:35:36.621 --> 01:35:39.230
<v Speaker 3>you can't like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to die like it doesn't have</v>

2320
01:35:39.231 --> 01:35:40.064
<v Speaker 3>its mom.</v>

2321
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:44.270
<v Speaker 3>It needs to be fed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I decided to feed to the chicken.</v>

2322
01:35:44.271 --> 01:35:45.620
<v Speaker 3>They were crying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2323
01:35:45.621 --> 01:35:48.520
<v Speaker 3>don't do it like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you've fed it to a hawk regular.</v>

2324
01:35:48.590 --> 01:35:51.500
<v Speaker 3>Forgive you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the moment that thing touched down</v>

2325
01:35:51.501 --> 01:35:54.440
<v Speaker 3>those fucking chickens mold that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those little dinosaurs.</v>

2326
01:35:54.770 --> 01:35:55.461
<v Speaker 3>They're monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2327
01:35:55.461 --> 01:35:57.830
<v Speaker 3>My inlaws have chickens and yellow kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of eat whatever.</v>

2328
01:35:57.950 --> 01:36:00.080
<v Speaker 3>Anything put in front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Killed a mouse.</v>

2329
01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:02.120
<v Speaker 3>An actual mouse too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not a Pinky,</v>

2330
01:36:02.121 --> 01:36:04.550
<v Speaker 3>but in a mouse mouse that got into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>cage.</v>

2331
01:36:04.750 --> 01:36:06.530
<v Speaker 3>The amount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a big chicken coop.</v>

2332
01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:09.590
<v Speaker 3>They get attacked by themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You lose some of them here and there.</v>

2333
01:36:09.710 --> 01:36:12.010
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they fuck each other up the package.</v>

2334
01:36:12.610 --> 01:36:16.730
<v Speaker 3>They fucking did decide to start chats</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on in their brains.</v>

2335
01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:21.410
<v Speaker 3>My dog killed a couple of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately in a coyote got one.</v>

2336
01:36:21.420 --> 01:36:24.020
<v Speaker 3>One</v>
<v Speaker 3>that happens quite a bit.</v>

2337
01:36:24.090 --> 01:36:25.600
<v Speaker 3>It does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

2338
01:36:25.670 --> 01:36:27.020
<v Speaker 3>they fucking kill everything.</v>

2339
01:36:27.530 --> 01:36:29.630
<v Speaker 3>Just chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They will fucking kill anything that's</v>

2340
01:36:29.631 --> 01:36:32.820
<v Speaker 3>small.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they packed my daughter and my wife</v>

2341
01:36:32.821 --> 01:36:33.441
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2342
01:36:33.441 --> 01:36:35.030
<v Speaker 3>they're just dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know any better.</v>

2343
01:36:35.031 --> 01:36:35.511
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2344
01:36:35.511 --> 01:36:37.880
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to eat her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just can't fucking eat.</v>

2345
01:36:37.881 --> 01:36:39.230
<v Speaker 3>Are you crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's little.</v>

2346
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:42.410
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to figure out if she's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little enough for them to eat the</v>

2347
01:36:42.411 --> 01:36:46.790
<v Speaker 3>fucking little dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>After I saw after I heard that episode</v>

2348
01:36:46.791 --> 01:36:49.190
<v Speaker 3>and you talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had my girlfriend listening because</v>

2349
01:36:49.191 --> 01:36:50.060
<v Speaker 3>she loves chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2350
01:36:50.061 --> 01:36:53.540
<v Speaker 3>like the think it's so much healthier</v>
<v Speaker 3>cleaner than anything else.</v>

2351
01:36:53.541 --> 01:36:54.540
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's listen.</v>

2352
01:36:54.570 --> 01:36:55.560
<v Speaker 3>I listen to this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2353
01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:57.110
<v Speaker 3>Kinda messed her up a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2354
01:36:57.111 --> 01:37:00.520
<v Speaker 3>chicken is healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just when you hear that you're kind of</v>

2355
01:37:00.530 --> 01:37:01.580
<v Speaker 3>like taken aback,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2356
01:37:01.820 --> 01:37:05.850
<v Speaker 3>I just look factory farming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think everybody can agree is a monster</v>

2357
01:37:05.851 --> 01:37:07.670
<v Speaker 3>is side effect of civilization.</v>

2358
01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:12.140
<v Speaker 3>It's horrific and that's what's really</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong with the way we get our food</v>

2359
01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:14.300
<v Speaker 3>stuffs so many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to Keith and all that kind of</v>

2360
01:37:14.301 --> 01:37:15.980
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

2364
01:37:19.790 --> 01:37:20.240
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2365
01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:21.620
<v Speaker 3>that's the darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2366
01:37:21.621 --> 01:37:25.040
<v Speaker 3>and if you feel better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have not from not consuming animals,</v>

2367
01:37:25.041 --> 01:37:27.470
<v Speaker 3>good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is not those people.</v>

2368
01:37:27.471 --> 01:37:31.040
<v Speaker 3>The problem is those people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressively do she to anyone who eats</v>

2369
01:37:31.041 --> 01:37:32.480
<v Speaker 3>meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>

2370
01:37:32.570 --> 01:37:34.550
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get them on my troll them now.</v>

2371
01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:39.380
<v Speaker 3>I put hashtag vegan meat dishes when I</v>
<v Speaker 3>cook.</v>

2372
01:37:39.381 --> 01:37:42.750
<v Speaker 3>Anything that hasn't even started</v>
<v Speaker 3>hashtagging that.</v>

2373
01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:44.450
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can just say you're vegan for</v>

2374
01:37:44.451 --> 01:37:46.930
<v Speaker 3>certain meals too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I see you post stuff on salad.</v>

2375
01:37:46.970 --> 01:37:50.080
<v Speaker 3>Write vegan meal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2376
01:37:51.070 --> 01:37:54.500
<v Speaker 3>most of my breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the time eating eggs.</v>

2377
01:37:54.501 --> 01:37:58.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm eating vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not how they take it.</v>

2378
01:37:58.770 --> 01:38:01.590
<v Speaker 3>You're either you're either in or you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the club.</v>

2379
01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:06.840
<v Speaker 3>Either you're in or in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I understand their motivation.</v>

2380
01:38:06.870 --> 01:38:10.770
<v Speaker 3>I just think the way they go about it is</v>
<v Speaker 3>so wrong and it turns people off.</v>

2381
01:38:12.230 --> 01:38:14.860
<v Speaker 2>It's like the people that are against</v>
<v Speaker 2>for throwing paint on people with,</v>

2382
01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:17.300
<v Speaker 2>I guess not going to stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to make somebody mad.</v>

2383
01:38:17.330 --> 01:38:18.163
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

2384
01:38:19.180 --> 01:38:23.450
<v Speaker 3>A lot of those animals that they get</v>
<v Speaker 3>from our clients about that.</v>

2385
01:38:24.590 --> 01:38:27.470
<v Speaker 3>Martin ever received the video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We showed that video last week of the</v>

2386
01:38:27.471 --> 01:38:31.400
<v Speaker 3>martin chasing down the rabbit hole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just martin.</v>

2387
01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:35.660
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know what a martin was</v>
<v Speaker 3>until I watched those shows.</v>

2388
01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:37.280
<v Speaker 3>You ever see those shows like the last</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

2389
01:38:37.281 --> 01:38:39.650
<v Speaker 3>guys that live in the mountains for</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's hard out there for a pimp.</v>

2416
01:39:49.830 --> 01:39:52.040
<v Speaker 3>Cold as fuck with a lift,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2417
01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:54.540
<v Speaker 3>living up there in Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2418
01:39:55.420 --> 01:39:56.900
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does the w.</v>

2419
01:39:56.970 --> 01:39:59.400
<v Speaker 3>Did you get any conclusions out of doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>this documentary?</v>

2420
01:39:59.430 --> 01:40:00.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there anything that you,</v>

2421
01:40:00.740 --> 01:40:02.730
<v Speaker 3>you got out of it where you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2422
01:40:02.731 --> 01:40:04.260
<v Speaker 3>you think that it's important for people</v>
<v Speaker 3>to know?</v>

2423
01:40:04.300 --> 01:40:04.691
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2424
01:40:04.691 --> 01:40:05.950
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've learned a lot myself.</v>

2425
01:40:05.951 --> 01:40:08.710
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the number one thing that I've</v>

2426
01:40:08.711 --> 01:40:10.330
<v Speaker 2>learned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very simple,</v>

2427
01:40:10.331 --> 01:40:12.760
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not educated enough or have enough</v>

2428
01:40:12.761 --> 01:40:16.120
<v Speaker 2>experience to really save anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think anybody out there that has a</v>

2429
01:40:16.121 --> 01:40:19.320
<v Speaker 2>friend or a family member struggling</v>
<v Speaker 2>with drugs or alcohol,</v>

2430
01:40:19.321 --> 01:40:21.790
<v Speaker 2>that the number one thing that you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly do is drive them towards</v>

2431
01:40:21.791 --> 01:40:23.530
<v Speaker 2>getting help,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that is,</v>

2432
01:40:23.531 --> 01:40:27.100
<v Speaker 2>whether it's going to aa meetings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's going to get a rehab or</v>

2433
01:40:27.101 --> 01:40:29.920
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just make them aware that they need</v>

2434
01:40:29.921 --> 01:40:31.630
<v Speaker 2>help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might not even know driving them</v>

2435
01:40:31.631 --> 01:40:35.470
<v Speaker 2>towards getting help because it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most important thing that you can</v>

2436
01:40:35.471 --> 01:40:35.920
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2437
01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:36.790
<v Speaker 2>and I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2438
01:40:37.060 --> 01:40:38.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people will talk shit about aaa</v>

2439
01:40:38.801 --> 01:40:40.690
<v Speaker 2>and say it doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've seen it work.</v>

2440
01:40:40.691 --> 01:40:45.490
<v Speaker 2>I've seen every saturday morning in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>down in the palisades,</v>

2441
01:40:45.491 --> 01:40:48.260
<v Speaker 2>there's a meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like 200 guys in there and a lot</v>

2442
01:40:48.261 --> 01:40:50.040
<v Speaker 2>of people have been sober for 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2443
01:40:50.050 --> 01:40:52.900
<v Speaker 2>so they're still going to meetings and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're still helping people and it's a</v>

2444
01:40:53.140 --> 01:40:53.973
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

2445
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:54.650
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2446
01:40:54.650 --> 01:40:55.950
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of a part of it too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2447
01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:59.710
<v Speaker 1>Not the money community of sober people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to disappoint the other</v>

2448
01:40:59.711 --> 01:41:02.680
<v Speaker 1>people in the community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people I've met in a or some of my</v>

2449
01:41:02.681 --> 01:41:04.300
<v Speaker 1>best friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like the best,</v>

2450
01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:05.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're all,</v>

2451
01:41:05.430 --> 01:41:06.880
<v Speaker 1>everybody's trying to do good and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2452
01:41:06.881 --> 01:41:10.150
<v Speaker 1>like they've maybe messed up in the past</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we feel bad about it now.</v>

2453
01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:12.910
<v Speaker 1>Everything we do is geared towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to help people and do good.</v>

2454
01:41:13.510 --> 01:41:15.490
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you pull up anything on ibogaine or</v>

2455
01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:18.460
<v Speaker 1>ibogaine works?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Found a couple of stories but they</v>

2456
01:41:18.461 --> 01:41:19.850
<v Speaker 1>weren't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't find like,</v>

2457
01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:20.960
<v Speaker 1>how do you spell it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ibo.</v>

2458
01:41:21.110 --> 01:41:26.110
<v Speaker 1>G I b o g a I n e I think I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say something to the court tomorrow and</v>

2459
01:41:31.210 --> 01:41:33.190
<v Speaker 1>I'll just say something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to contrast them a little bit is</v>

2460
01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:35.800
<v Speaker 1>you don't need to be an expert to help</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody,</v>

2461
01:41:35.890 --> 01:41:37.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can help somebody,</v>

2462
01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:39.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's saying drive them towards,</v>

2463
01:41:39.581 --> 01:41:40.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making,</v>

2464
01:41:40.510 --> 01:41:41.680
<v Speaker 1>making sure they're getting help.</v>

2465
01:41:42.670 --> 01:41:45.880
<v Speaker 1>That was a kind of an issue with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also an issue with my oldest brother</v>

2466
01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:48.430
<v Speaker 1>is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially with my oldest brother,</v>

2467
01:41:48.510 --> 01:41:51.100
<v Speaker 1>I kind of felt like I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything about like all</v>

2468
01:41:51.110 --> 01:41:53.680
<v Speaker 1>this addiction stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand.</v>

2469
01:41:53.681 --> 01:41:56.170
<v Speaker 1>He's like bipolar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if he's bipolar and the</v>

2470
01:41:56.171 --> 01:41:59.750
<v Speaker 1>ups and downs or because of the drugs or</v>
<v Speaker 1>a combination thereof.</v>

2471
01:41:59.770 --> 01:42:03.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the hell is going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so almost felt defeated in a way and</v>

2472
01:42:03.401 --> 01:42:06.880
<v Speaker 1>then anyone out there listening that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealt with addicts before.</v>

2473
01:42:06.881 --> 01:42:11.770
<v Speaker 1>You get burned by them so many times</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it just leaves you with a sour</v>

2474
01:42:11.771 --> 01:42:15.100
<v Speaker 1>taste in your mouth and you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even really want to help to a</v>

2475
01:42:15.101 --> 01:42:17.200
<v Speaker 1>certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to help.</v>

2476
01:42:17.201 --> 01:42:20.560
<v Speaker 1>You have to continue to reach out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to realize that it's not the</v>

2477
01:42:20.561 --> 01:42:23.800
<v Speaker 1>person it is becoming a different person</v>
<v Speaker 1>over a period of time.</v>

2478
01:42:24.130 --> 01:42:27.370
<v Speaker 1>They're not the same person that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>once were and you have to try to help</v>

2479
01:42:27.371 --> 01:42:30.640
<v Speaker 1>them and you don't need to be an expert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to know shIt about</v>

2480
01:42:30.670 --> 01:42:33.010
<v Speaker 1>addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you need to know is that they need</v>

2481
01:42:33.011 --> 01:42:36.790
<v Speaker 1>to get help and that a lot of the stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's happening and you'll kind of hear</v>

2482
01:42:36.791 --> 01:42:39.610
<v Speaker 1>them say it over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They blame stuff on other people all the</v>

2483
01:42:39.611 --> 01:42:40.690
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2484
01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:42.580
<v Speaker 1>it's not really their fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

2485
01:42:42.581 --> 01:42:45.790
<v Speaker 1>they literally don't have control</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore and I don't want to make excuses</v>

2486
01:42:45.791 --> 01:42:48.610
<v Speaker 1>for people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the predicament that they get</v>

2487
01:42:48.611 --> 01:42:51.640
<v Speaker 1>and that's a predicament my oldest</v>
<v Speaker 1>brother was in and we weren't able to</v>

2488
01:42:51.641 --> 01:42:53.740
<v Speaker 1>pull him out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a predicament that he was in</v>

2489
01:42:53.741 --> 01:42:56.020
<v Speaker 1>and were able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are able to save his life.</v>

2490
01:42:56.040 --> 01:42:59.560
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the things you brought up</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the documentary is bipolar and the</v>

2491
01:42:59.561 --> 01:43:04.561
<v Speaker 1>diagnosis for bipolar and how many more</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are diagnosed at three percent in</v>

2492
01:43:07.210 --> 01:43:08.380
<v Speaker 1>10 years or something like that.</v>

2493
01:43:08.420 --> 01:43:13.090
<v Speaker 1>And what is the excuse of for that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that they didn't know before or is it</v>

2494
01:43:13.091 --> 01:43:14.750
<v Speaker 1>just that they're trying to sell people</v>
<v Speaker 1>medicare?</v>

2495
01:43:15.260 --> 01:43:17.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to sell people on stuff</v>

2496
01:43:17.290 --> 01:43:19.270
<v Speaker 1>that happened with like adderall and</v>
<v Speaker 1>ritalin as well.</v>

2497
01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:23.560
<v Speaker 1>I think that like bipolar is definitely</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real thing and it's a lot.</v>

2498
01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:26.200
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like real bipolar is a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>more rare than,</v>

2499
01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:30.010
<v Speaker 1>than is being diagnosed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I say what is bipolar exactly</v>

2500
01:43:30.011 --> 01:43:30.844
<v Speaker 1>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>

2501
01:43:31.740 --> 01:43:33.460
<v Speaker 1>You're at different polls like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2502
01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:34.260
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2503
01:43:34.260 --> 01:43:36.920
<v Speaker 1>you're a one one time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2504
01:43:36.930 --> 01:43:39.580
<v Speaker 1>you're really happy and hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so great to see it another time.</v>

2505
01:43:39.581 --> 01:43:40.750
<v Speaker 1>You're an asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2506
01:43:40.751 --> 01:43:44.200
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just both opposite ends of the</v>

2507
01:43:44.201 --> 01:43:46.450
<v Speaker 1>spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We kind of ironic because that's how</v>

2508
01:43:46.451 --> 01:43:47.350
<v Speaker 1>we're addicts are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2509
01:43:47.351 --> 01:43:49.710
<v Speaker 1>And we all have that anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we all have a little bit of like,</v>

2510
01:43:49.790 --> 01:43:50.910
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really happy with the.</v>

2511
01:43:51.110 --> 01:43:52.040
<v Speaker 1>And I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't</v>

2512
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:55.190
<v Speaker 2>treat our brother sometimes for certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>things because they wanted them to get</v>

2513
01:43:55.191 --> 01:43:58.660
<v Speaker 2>clean first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like shit hot,</v>

2514
01:43:58.790 --> 01:44:00.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2515
01:44:00.350 --> 01:44:01.610
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's already an addict.</v>

2516
01:44:01.611 --> 01:44:05.120
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck did we get them clean so</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to treat the bipolar.</v>

2517
01:44:05.121 --> 01:44:07.640
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right that there's similar</v>

2518
01:44:07.641 --> 01:44:09.470
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mark says something really important in</v>

2519
01:44:09.471 --> 01:44:10.281
<v Speaker 2>the documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

2520
01:44:10.281 --> 01:44:13.670
<v Speaker 2>I talked to our older brother and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing that he said to me is the only</v>

2521
01:44:13.671 --> 01:44:17.150
<v Speaker 2>time I felt normal was when I was in</v>
<v Speaker 2>jail because I was completely sober.</v>

2522
01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:18.900
<v Speaker 2>He had gotten thrown in jail for like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2523
01:44:18.910 --> 01:44:19.743
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

2524
01:44:19.990 --> 01:44:21.920
<v Speaker 2>you're not bipolar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not bipolar.</v>

2525
01:44:21.950 --> 01:44:23.910
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's all the stuff via a lot.</v>

2526
01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:25.580
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Biggest part of it,</v>

2527
01:44:25.581 --> 01:44:26.331
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2528
01:44:26.331 --> 01:44:28.640
<v Speaker 2>So how long was he in jail for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three months.</v>

2529
01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:32.090
<v Speaker 2>Then that time he felt okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

2530
01:44:32.260 --> 01:44:32.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

2531
01:44:32.810 --> 01:44:36.020
<v Speaker 2>That's was the craziest thing to me too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's nuts.</v>

2532
01:44:36.290 --> 01:44:39.800
<v Speaker 2>And then when he got out and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>started going back to his old ways and</v>

2533
01:44:39.801 --> 01:44:41.570
<v Speaker 2>he would go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would just go up and down,</v>

2534
01:44:41.620 --> 01:44:43.000
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what did he get thrown in jail for?</v>

2535
01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:46.100
<v Speaker 2>Violating probation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like he was a bouncer at a bunch</v>

2536
01:44:46.101 --> 01:44:50.120
<v Speaker 2>of bars and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got into so many fights and he town</v>

2537
01:44:50.130 --> 01:44:54.910
<v Speaker 2>bad ass beat up a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there was mma around back then he</v>

2538
01:44:54.911 --> 01:44:56.270
<v Speaker 2>might have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he might have had a career,</v>

2539
01:44:57.090 --> 01:45:00.920
<v Speaker 2>but like he was kinda that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy like he never was a bully.</v>

2540
01:45:01.100 --> 01:45:03.320
<v Speaker 2>He never boss anybody around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if he,</v>

2541
01:45:03.410 --> 01:45:05.390
<v Speaker 2>if he saw you and somebody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>choking you,</v>

2542
01:45:05.540 --> 01:45:07.940
<v Speaker 2>he'd go up and kick the guy's ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's done.</v>

2543
01:45:07.941 --> 01:45:10.160
<v Speaker 2>It was never enough for him either to</v>
<v Speaker 2>just hit somebody.</v>

2544
01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:12.980
<v Speaker 2>He had to fucking throw a bar stool on</v>
<v Speaker 2>top of him or something afterward.</v>

2545
01:45:12.981 --> 01:45:17.360
<v Speaker 2>He was one of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the bipolar diagnosis and the fact</v>

2546
01:45:17.361 --> 01:45:20.630
<v Speaker 2>that after he was in jail for three</v>
<v Speaker 2>months,</v>

2547
01:45:20.631 --> 01:45:23.380
<v Speaker 2>he felt totally normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that the,</v>

2548
01:45:23.420 --> 01:45:26.810
<v Speaker 2>that all the highs and lows are just</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming from the drugs in his system and</v>

2549
01:45:26.811 --> 01:45:31.160
<v Speaker 2>out of a system and the fluctuating</v>
<v Speaker 2>levels and just didn't know how to feel?</v>

2550
01:45:31.220 --> 01:45:32.480
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a big part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2551
01:45:32.481 --> 01:45:36.350
<v Speaker 2>I can't really speak for him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know for myself when I was trying</v>

2552
01:45:36.351 --> 01:45:38.810
<v Speaker 2>to get off of the drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went on a horrible drug called</v>

2553
01:45:38.811 --> 01:45:41.870
<v Speaker 2>suboxone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a miracle drug for the time you</v>

2554
01:45:41.871 --> 01:45:43.610
<v Speaker 2>need it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is I was on it for eight</v>

2555
01:45:43.611 --> 01:45:48.110
<v Speaker 2>months instead of for one week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a heroin drug,</v>

2556
01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:49.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

2557
01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:52.430
<v Speaker 2>it's an opiate that helps you get off of</v>
<v Speaker 2>other opiates.</v>

2558
01:45:52.700 --> 01:45:54.220
<v Speaker 2>So it's kind of a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if they.</v>

2559
01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:56.540
<v Speaker 2>Did that make you feel high when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>on that stuff?</v>

2560
01:45:56.570 --> 01:45:57.920
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't really feel high.</v>

2561
01:45:57.921 --> 01:46:00.020
<v Speaker 2>You just don't feel sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

2562
01:46:00.021 --> 01:46:01.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened to me,</v>

2563
01:46:01.371 --> 01:46:03.050
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on it for like a really long</v>

2564
01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:07.340
<v Speaker 2>extended period of time and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt completely out of whack all the</v>

2565
01:46:07.341 --> 01:46:08.174
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like,</v>

2566
01:46:08.540 --> 01:46:11.840
<v Speaker 2>like very up and down because if I</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't have the drug in me,</v>

2567
01:46:11.841 --> 01:46:13.810
<v Speaker 2>I would have like anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>

2568
01:46:13.811 --> 01:46:15.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna get withdrawals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2569
01:46:15.290 --> 01:46:16.760
<v Speaker 2>if I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I was running out of it,</v>

2570
01:46:16.761 --> 01:46:19.890
<v Speaker 2>I get anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just had so many ups and downs from,</v>

2571
01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:22.300
<v Speaker 2>from that particular drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think also from,</v>

2572
01:46:22.690 --> 01:46:25.100
<v Speaker 2>from the opiate painkillers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they always made me somebody that I</v>

2573
01:46:25.101 --> 01:46:29.740
<v Speaker 2>wasn't always like made me call my</v>
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend at the time and yell at her.</v>

2574
01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:31.910
<v Speaker 2>So do some asshole thing that wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

2575
01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:34.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they made you do that.</v>

2576
01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:37.910
<v Speaker 2>I felt compelled to do that in a way</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you would never feel compelled to</v>

2577
01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:40.190
<v Speaker 2>share if you were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're always.</v>

2578
01:46:40.191 --> 01:46:41.570
<v Speaker 2>You always break it down to the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2579
01:46:41.580 --> 01:46:44.180
<v Speaker 2>they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't force me to do it.</v>

2580
01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:47.840
<v Speaker 2>But while I was on those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I exhibited behavior that I wouldn't</v>

2581
01:46:47.841 --> 01:46:49.800
<v Speaker 2>normally do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fucking girl in the movie lights</v>

2582
01:46:49.801 --> 01:46:50.070
<v Speaker 2>herself</v>

2583
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:52.920
<v Speaker 3>on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's on that story.</v>

2584
01:46:52.921 --> 01:46:55.080
<v Speaker 3>It's so fucking sad that that story</v>
<v Speaker 3>killed me.</v>

2585
01:46:55.081 --> 01:46:56.260
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2586
01:46:56.261 --> 01:46:58.480
<v Speaker 3>they make you do some crazy shit like an</v>
<v Speaker 3>ice.</v>

2587
01:46:58.590 --> 01:46:59.850
<v Speaker 3>When I say make,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they,</v>

2588
01:46:59.910 --> 01:47:03.600
<v Speaker 3>they literally kind of make you do some</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy stuff because I don't think you're</v>

2589
01:47:03.601 --> 01:47:07.620
<v Speaker 3>really not much control anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well your brain is a bunch of synopsis</v>

2590
01:47:07.621 --> 01:47:11.760
<v Speaker 3>and a bunch of neurochemicals reacting</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a bunch of shit going on.</v>

2591
01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:16.080
<v Speaker 3>And when you add some new shit in there</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're throwing some massive opiates</v>

2592
01:47:16.081 --> 01:47:21.081
<v Speaker 3>in there and all of a sudden all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>signals are all fucking crossed and</v>

2593
01:47:22.110 --> 01:47:25.260
<v Speaker 3>everything's firing goofy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's literally not you.</v>

2594
01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:27.470
<v Speaker 2>And iT goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes to that same fact of like a,</v>

2595
01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:29.510
<v Speaker 2>I think therapy is really important for</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2596
01:47:29.511 --> 01:47:31.900
<v Speaker 2>And I think therapy is something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to do.</v>

2597
01:47:31.930 --> 01:47:33.230
<v Speaker 2>It's not something you have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2598
01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:34.750
<v Speaker 2>like you kind of get to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a,</v>

2599
01:47:35.170 --> 01:47:35.770
<v Speaker 2>some sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2600
01:47:35.770 --> 01:47:37.960
<v Speaker 2>it's like a luxury I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is that,</v>

2601
01:47:37.961 --> 01:47:39.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

2602
01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:42.880
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people will go to therapy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they want to get a drug with it,</v>

2603
01:47:42.881 --> 01:47:43.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they want to go.</v>

2604
01:47:43.990 --> 01:47:46.510
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have this drug seeking behavior where</v>

2605
01:47:46.511 --> 01:47:47.231
<v Speaker 2>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2606
01:47:47.231 --> 01:47:49.990
<v Speaker 2>a pill will fix me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but talking to this guy's not gonna fix</v>

2607
01:47:49.991 --> 01:47:53.150
<v Speaker 2>me when actually talking to the guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can fix you with?</v>

2608
01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:56.050
<v Speaker 2>What can be the cure?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we have these things called</v>

2609
01:47:56.051 --> 01:47:57.790
<v Speaker 2>escape fires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you know what that is,</v>

2610
01:47:57.791 --> 01:48:00.020
<v Speaker 2>but like in firefighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2611
01:48:00.580 --> 01:48:04.450
<v Speaker 2>there was this giant fire and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there was 30 15 firefighters on a</v>

2612
01:48:04.451 --> 01:48:06.700
<v Speaker 2>hill and a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the guys said,</v>

2613
01:48:06.701 --> 01:48:08.620
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to light a fire to make the</v>

2614
01:48:08.621 --> 01:48:11.890
<v Speaker 2>fire jumped over this thing that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>like and I will be safe.</v>

2615
01:48:11.890 --> 01:48:13.060
<v Speaker 2>And everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2616
01:48:13.061 --> 01:48:15.580
<v Speaker 2>That's not going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the guy lit a match and did it and</v>

2617
01:48:15.581 --> 01:48:17.920
<v Speaker 2>he was the only one that survived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody else was trying to get off the</v>

2618
01:48:17.921 --> 01:48:20.650
<v Speaker 2>mountain and they all died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like that's the problem with America</v>

2619
01:48:20.651 --> 01:48:22.390
<v Speaker 2>is how's that work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying,</v>

2620
01:48:22.450 --> 01:48:26.830
<v Speaker 2>well it's uk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called the escape fire and so you</v>

2621
01:48:26.831 --> 01:48:30.100
<v Speaker 2>can light a fire to bake the fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of go around you.</v>

2622
01:48:30.101 --> 01:48:33.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly how that works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I'm saying is like the answer a</v>

2623
01:48:33.141 --> 01:48:35.360
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The answer a lot of times can be right</v>

2624
01:48:35.361 --> 01:48:36.940
<v Speaker 2>in front of our face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can say,</v>

2625
01:48:36.941 --> 01:48:39.190
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This person needs any therapy and the</v>

2626
01:48:39.191 --> 01:48:43.300
<v Speaker 2>person won't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a big problem with America and</v>

2627
01:48:43.301 --> 01:48:43.901
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2628
01:48:43.901 --> 01:48:45.280
<v Speaker 2>we want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want an answer,</v>

2629
01:48:45.281 --> 01:48:47.380
<v Speaker 2>we want a solution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want a pill,</v>

2630
01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:50.410
<v Speaker 2>we want a quick fix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want a pill to get you off pills.</v>

2631
01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:51.820
<v Speaker 2>But if I'm standing there I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

2632
01:48:51.821 --> 01:48:52.780
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come with me,</v>

2633
01:48:52.930 --> 01:48:54.160
<v Speaker 2>I have the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

2634
01:48:54.190 --> 01:48:55.023
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>

2635
01:48:55.060 --> 01:48:56.680
<v Speaker 2>We already know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not a good answer,</v>

2636
01:48:56.950 --> 01:48:58.960
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's a problem.</v>

2637
01:48:58.961 --> 01:49:03.070
<v Speaker 2>It's like we have to open our eyes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>open our minds and start thinking of</v>

2638
01:49:03.190 --> 01:49:05.600
<v Speaker 2>different ways to heal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pain to cure pain.</v>

2639
01:49:05.601 --> 01:49:06.431
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2640
01:49:06.431 --> 01:49:07.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're never going to cure it.</v>

2641
01:49:07.301 --> 01:49:09.740
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna hold it down for awhile.</v>

2642
01:49:09.820 --> 01:49:12.850
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the only way to fix something</v>

2643
01:49:12.851 --> 01:49:15.910
<v Speaker 2>really like surgery or like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stem cells now and everything.</v>

2644
01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:20.920
<v Speaker 2>So progressive that I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a shoulder that I have a rotator</v>

2645
01:49:21.131 --> 01:49:24.550
<v Speaker 2>cuff surgery that I need to have and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've just held off on getting the</v>

2646
01:49:24.551 --> 01:49:26.140
<v Speaker 2>surgery because I feel like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yOu know,</v>

2647
01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:28.780
<v Speaker 2>cutting my shoulder open and doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever is going to do more damage.</v>

2648
01:49:28.781 --> 01:49:30.100
<v Speaker 2>And actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2649
01:49:30.130 --> 01:49:31.900
<v Speaker 2>fix it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is maybe a stupid thinG to think,</v>

2650
01:49:31.901 --> 01:49:34.030
<v Speaker 2>but I'm actually trying to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2651
01:49:34.031 --> 01:49:35.620
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stem cells or stem cells.</v>

2652
01:49:35.621 --> 01:49:37.060
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there another answer to this?</v>

2653
01:49:37.061 --> 01:49:38.590
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't found It yet,</v>

2654
01:49:38.591 --> 01:49:39.790
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I will.</v>

2655
01:49:39.791 --> 01:49:42.250
<v Speaker 2>And if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I don't then I'll go get the surgery.</v>

2656
01:49:42.251 --> 01:49:43.780
<v Speaker 2>But I'm trying to explore other options.</v>

2657
01:49:43.940 --> 01:49:45.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a bad idea to explore other</v>

2658
01:49:45.801 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 3>options,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it really depends entirely upon</v>

2659
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:52.330
<v Speaker 1>how badly your shoulders damaged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how badly the structure of damaged in</v>

2660
01:49:52.331 --> 01:49:54.700
<v Speaker 1>the shoulder is a weird one because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>moves so weird.</v>

2661
01:49:54.701 --> 01:49:56.800
<v Speaker 1>It's got so many different ways it can</v>
<v Speaker 1>articulate.</v>

2662
01:49:57.230 --> 01:50:00.610
<v Speaker 1>It's a tear in the rotator cuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super common.</v>

2663
01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:01.673
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2664
01:50:01.690 --> 01:50:04.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that we talked about</v>

2665
01:50:04.061 --> 01:50:05.360
<v Speaker 1>before about these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2666
01:50:05.390 --> 01:50:07.180
<v Speaker 1>advertising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2667
01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:09.370
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to advertise for drugs.</v>

2668
01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:11.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they're ever going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take that down,</v>

2669
01:50:11.741 --> 01:50:15.490
<v Speaker 1>but I think that that is one of the more</v>
<v Speaker 1>disturbing aspects of the pharmaceutical</v>

2670
01:50:15.491 --> 01:50:19.540
<v Speaker 1>industry because we all know tHat</v>
<v Speaker 1>advertising gets people to buy shit and</v>

2671
01:50:19.670 --> 01:50:23.230
<v Speaker 1>it's not that big of a problem and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a car or when it's an iphone,</v>

2672
01:50:23.231 --> 01:50:25.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't haVe a problem with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2673
01:50:25.060 --> 01:50:25.871
<v Speaker 1>People can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2674
01:50:25.871 --> 01:50:26.950
<v Speaker 1>it can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2675
01:50:26.951 --> 01:50:29.860
<v Speaker 1>it supports consumerism and materialism</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not bad.</v>

2676
01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.440
<v Speaker 1>That's not good for our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can just.</v>

2677
01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:34.910
<v Speaker 1>You could be strong enough to get past</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and I think you're going to be all</v>

2678
01:50:34.911 --> 01:50:37.150
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the pill thing,</v>

2679
01:50:37.330 --> 01:50:37.901
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's different.</v>

2680
01:50:37.901 --> 01:50:41.110
<v Speaker 1>We trust doctors like you don't go to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>car dealership,</v>

2681
01:50:41.111 --> 01:50:45.460
<v Speaker 1>trust in the car dealer to be like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bargain,</v>

2682
01:50:45.620 --> 01:50:46.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take care of.</v>

2683
01:50:46.690 --> 01:50:48.160
<v Speaker 1>Take care of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's also,</v>

2684
01:50:48.161 --> 01:50:52.810
<v Speaker 1>they suggest that you ask your doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't your fucking doctor tell you</v>

2685
01:50:52.811 --> 01:50:55.960
<v Speaker 1>what medications do you know that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that ask their doctor,</v>

2686
01:50:55.961 --> 01:50:57.340
<v Speaker 1>when I go into stat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

2687
01:50:57.580 --> 01:50:59.260
<v Speaker 1>when you go in and ask your doctor for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pill,</v>

2688
01:50:59.261 --> 01:51:01.300
<v Speaker 1>75 percent of the people will get that</v>
<v Speaker 1>pill.</v>

2689
01:51:01.810 --> 01:51:04.090
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy because here's what happens</v>

2690
01:51:04.091 --> 01:51:07.030
<v Speaker 1>wIth doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The doctors are overprescribing for</v>

2691
01:51:07.031 --> 01:51:09.400
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their hands are tied because if I go</v>

2692
01:51:09.401 --> 01:51:11.320
<v Speaker 1>into a doctor and I tell them I'm in</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain,</v>

2693
01:51:11.620 --> 01:51:14.950
<v Speaker 1>their job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to the medical industry,</v>

2694
01:51:14.951 --> 01:51:16.360
<v Speaker 1>their job is getting out of pain.</v>

2695
01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:17.980
<v Speaker 1>So how did they get out of pain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They gave me an opiate,</v>

2696
01:51:17.981 --> 01:51:19.630
<v Speaker 1>painkillers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They give me All these different things</v>

2697
01:51:19.960 --> 01:51:22.450
<v Speaker 1>to get me out of pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if they don't get me out of pain and</v>

2698
01:51:22.451 --> 01:51:24.080
<v Speaker 1>I fill out a doctor survey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know what?</v>

2699
01:51:24.100 --> 01:51:27.130
<v Speaker 1>My doctor didn't get me out of pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doctor gets a bad rating.</v>

2700
01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:29.050
<v Speaker 1>They get enough bad ratings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can lose their license.</v>

2701
01:51:29.230 --> 01:51:32.620
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of pressure on doctors</v>
<v Speaker 1>also.</v>

2702
01:51:32.621 --> 01:51:34.750
<v Speaker 1>How the hell is anybody know how much</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain you're in?</v>

2703
01:51:34.900 --> 01:51:35.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big one,</v>

2704
01:51:35.981 --> 01:51:38.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neck pain or back pain really hurts,</v>

2705
01:51:38.891 --> 01:51:41.080
<v Speaker 1>like on a scale of one to 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say yeah,</v>

2706
01:51:41.470 --> 01:51:44.380
<v Speaker 1>anybody can say that they've got</v>
<v Speaker 1>something wrong with her back.</v>

2707
01:51:44.420 --> 01:51:48.100
<v Speaker 1>And I talk about painkiller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Painkiller is actually a great thing for</v>

2708
01:51:48.101 --> 01:51:49.960
<v Speaker 1>acute pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get in a car accident,</v>

2709
01:51:49.961 --> 01:51:52.270
<v Speaker 1>you have a broken leg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it takes some oxycontin,</v>

2710
01:51:52.271 --> 01:51:54.310
<v Speaker 1>you don't feel it and it take that for</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2711
01:51:54.311 --> 01:51:55.240
<v Speaker 1>two or three days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2712
01:51:55.241 --> 01:51:58.630
<v Speaker 1>you don't take that for four months</v>
<v Speaker 1>because then you become a drug addict.</v>

2713
01:51:58.930 --> 01:52:02.460
<v Speaker 1>So I think that if a also like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>prescribing and uh,</v>

2714
01:52:02.470 --> 01:52:03.870
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number of,</v>

2715
01:52:03.920 --> 01:52:06.280
<v Speaker 1>of actual pills we give people needs to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come down.</v>

2716
01:52:06.550 --> 01:52:08.630
<v Speaker 1>We just make to way too many drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>

2717
01:52:08.790 --> 01:52:10.830
<v Speaker 1>is it all just money driven you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because uh,</v>

2718
01:52:11.260 --> 01:52:12.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you get a ticket,</v>

2719
01:52:12.610 --> 01:52:15.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a speeding ticket that's like on</v>

2720
01:52:15.341 --> 01:52:18.280
<v Speaker 1>your record and you get noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speeding ticket shows up,</v>

2721
01:52:18.281 --> 01:52:20.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come they don't have something</v>

2722
01:52:20.321 --> 01:52:21.670
<v Speaker 1>similar with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with drugs?</v>

2723
01:52:21.671 --> 01:52:22.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

2724
01:52:22.150 --> 01:52:24.640
<v Speaker 1>when you get prescribed a drug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how come you don't have like a</v>

2725
01:52:24.641 --> 01:52:25.510
<v Speaker 1>record?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2726
01:52:25.511 --> 01:52:27.250
<v Speaker 1>there is at least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least within the state,</v>

2727
01:52:27.251 --> 01:52:29.890
<v Speaker 1>in California there is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a thing,</v>

2728
01:52:29.891 --> 01:52:31.960
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is not everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 1>required to use it.</v>

2729
01:52:31.961 --> 01:52:35.140
<v Speaker 1>It's not mandatory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So When when that kind of stuff becomes</v>

2730
01:52:35.141 --> 01:52:37.240
<v Speaker 1>mandatory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be fun because a lot of people</v>

2731
01:52:37.241 --> 01:52:37.571
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2732
01:52:37.571 --> 01:52:39.230
<v Speaker 1>it's my privacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if I go,</v>

2733
01:52:39.300 --> 01:52:42.250
<v Speaker 1>if I go to costco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>costco shouldn't be able to know what I</v>

2734
01:52:42.251 --> 01:52:44.680
<v Speaker 1>get at walgreens and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

2735
01:52:44.681 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 1>At some point we have to lose</v>

2736
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:49.850
<v Speaker 2>that privacy issue because it's killing</v>
<v Speaker 2>people or to protect people.</v>

2737
01:52:49.851 --> 01:52:50.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're.</v>

2738
01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:53.630
<v Speaker 2>We're to protect people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think sometimes in society we need</v>

2739
01:52:53.631 --> 01:52:56.090
<v Speaker 2>laws that protect people from</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

2740
01:52:57.510 --> 01:53:01.520
<v Speaker 2>That's what caused the whole oxycontin</v>
<v Speaker 2>industry in Florida was that they didn't</v>

2741
01:53:01.521 --> 01:53:03.980
<v Speaker 2>have a database where you could go to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor,</v>

2742
01:53:03.981 --> 01:53:05.530
<v Speaker 2>get a prescription,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then go down the road,</v>

2743
01:53:05.550 --> 01:53:07.310
<v Speaker 2>get another prescription from another</v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor.</v>

2744
01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:11.570
<v Speaker 2>When the vanguard released that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that piece of the oxycontin express,</v>

2745
01:53:11.870 --> 01:53:15.190
<v Speaker 2>which a really kind of highlighted that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it showed a bunch of people and that</v>

2746
01:53:15.470 --> 01:53:17.960
<v Speaker 2>people that eventually wound up dying of</v>
<v Speaker 2>overdoses,</v>

2747
01:53:17.961 --> 01:53:20.750
<v Speaker 2>but when they followed them around and</v>
<v Speaker 2>found out how easy it is to go to these</v>

2748
01:53:20.751 --> 01:53:23.930
<v Speaker 2>pain management centers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what changed the industry and</v>

2749
01:53:23.931 --> 01:53:27.770
<v Speaker 2>that's what also changed the pills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the be able to crush them up and smoke</v>

2750
01:53:27.771 --> 01:53:29.330
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't do that anymore.</v>

2751
01:53:29.410 --> 01:53:30.650
<v Speaker 2>Do they call those pill mills?</v>

2752
01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:34.310
<v Speaker 2>Pill mills and people just go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those people at West Virginia,</v>

2753
01:53:34.311 --> 01:53:37.370
<v Speaker 2>there's a movie called oxycontin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've pretty much seen every drug movie</v>

2754
01:53:37.371 --> 01:53:39.620
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So oxycontin was a pretty interesting</v>

2755
01:53:39.621 --> 01:53:43.030
<v Speaker 2>movie where it was just about one single</v>
<v Speaker 2>town in West Virginia and that's like</v>

2756
01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:47.420
<v Speaker 2>the nickname of the town and these</v>
<v Speaker 2>people drive from west Virginia down to</v>

2757
01:53:47.421 --> 01:53:48.980
<v Speaker 2>Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get like a thousand pills,</v>

2758
01:53:49.220 --> 01:53:51.470
<v Speaker 2>come back and sell them on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's what they do.</v>

2759
01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:54.380
<v Speaker 2>And for West Virginia they got a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>money doing it and stuff like that,</v>

2760
01:53:54.381 --> 01:53:56.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because everything's cheaper there.</v>

2761
01:53:56.360 --> 01:53:58.400
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've caused an epidemic there.</v>

2762
01:53:58.401 --> 01:53:59.510
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

2763
01:53:59.530 --> 01:54:01.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of hundred people that live in</v>

2764
01:54:01.731 --> 01:54:04.850
<v Speaker 2>that town there and there's a couple</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are trafficking all these</v>

2765
01:54:04.851 --> 01:54:07.100
<v Speaker 2>drugs in and making this huge problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2766
01:54:07.101 --> 01:54:10.040
<v Speaker 2>Those depression commercials are</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly problematic,</v>

2767
01:54:10.041 --> 01:54:11.540
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where everybody's smiling.</v>

2768
01:54:11.541 --> 01:54:15.260
<v Speaker 2>There's butterflies and flowers and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>see the sun coming up on the person's</v>

2769
01:54:15.261 --> 01:54:18.530
<v Speaker 2>face and all of a sudden they're smiling</v>
<v Speaker 2>again and you want that.</v>

2770
01:54:18.530 --> 01:54:21.680
<v Speaker 2>Like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really dangerous because it's so</v>

2771
01:54:21.681 --> 01:54:24.140
<v Speaker 2>influential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You watch a commercial and those</v>

2772
01:54:24.141 --> 01:54:26.060
<v Speaker 2>commercials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's visual,</v>

2773
01:54:26.061 --> 01:54:28.310
<v Speaker 2>there's music playing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a pretty girl.</v>

2774
01:54:28.470 --> 01:54:31.030
<v Speaker 2>The sunset in so influential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2775
01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:32.610
<v Speaker 2>those little sad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

2776
01:54:32.930 --> 01:54:36.350
<v Speaker 2>not like stick figures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a little fat chubby faces like round</v>

2777
01:54:36.390 --> 01:54:37.350
<v Speaker 2>moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>

2778
01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:38.050
<v Speaker 2>Little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2779
01:54:38.050 --> 01:54:42.890
<v Speaker 2>The zoloft point of the advertisement Is</v>
<v Speaker 2>really is to sell it.</v>

2780
01:54:43.070 --> 01:54:44.450
<v Speaker 2>They have to list the side effects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2781
01:54:44.451 --> 01:54:47.030
<v Speaker 2>That's part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah that real quick.</v>

2782
01:54:47.060 --> 01:54:49.160
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is the whole rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>commercials,</v>

2783
01:54:49.161 --> 01:54:50.810
<v Speaker 2>just to distract you from the side</v>
<v Speaker 2>effects.</v>

2784
01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:53.210
<v Speaker 2>One of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the commercials is showing a</v>

2785
01:54:53.211 --> 01:54:54.320
<v Speaker 2>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I,</v>

2786
01:54:54.390 --> 01:54:55.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

2787
01:54:55.611 --> 01:54:57.290
<v Speaker 2>I can take any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it just seems random.</v>

2788
01:54:57.470 --> 01:55:01.310
<v Speaker 2>They show this woman getting like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a backhoe and she's operating as</v>

2789
01:55:01.311 --> 01:55:03.320
<v Speaker 2>bacco and ashley ashley's operated back</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

2790
01:55:03.321 --> 01:55:06.440
<v Speaker 2>they say don't operate heavy machinery</v>
<v Speaker 2>while using this product and you're</v>

2791
01:55:06.441 --> 01:55:08.030
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is so backwards.</v>

2792
01:55:08.031 --> 01:55:11.060
<v Speaker 2>She's operating a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of like a crane or a backhoe</v>

2793
01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:15.470
<v Speaker 2>and she's like in like a business outfit</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they don't have the machinery and</v>

2794
01:55:15.471 --> 01:55:17.270
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where are these people getting,</v>

2795
01:55:17.450 --> 01:55:19.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are the ad wizards behind this one?</v>

2796
01:55:21.300 --> 01:55:24.470
<v Speaker 2>And then the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the other thing was the saying that</v>

2797
01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:28.010
<v Speaker 2>medication for depression didn't do any</v>
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>

2798
01:55:28.250 --> 01:55:31.850
<v Speaker 2>didn't get people any less depressed</v>
<v Speaker 2>than any other method of treating it.</v>

2799
01:55:32.270 --> 01:55:33.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like you said,</v>

2800
01:55:33.171 --> 01:55:37.010
<v Speaker 2>you had a friend that he did some</v>
<v Speaker 2>antidepressants and it helped them and I</v>

2801
01:55:37.330 --> 01:55:39.080
<v Speaker 2>Was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he just got off fucking propecia,</v>

2802
01:55:39.081 --> 01:55:42.230
<v Speaker 2>it might have cut it off right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also though I don't know enough</v>

2803
01:55:42.231 --> 01:55:44.880
<v Speaker 2>about it to say like shouldn't take this</v>
<v Speaker 2>or shouldn't take that.</v>

2804
01:55:45.180 --> 01:55:47.250
<v Speaker 2>What I'd say is like look into it more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2805
01:55:47.251 --> 01:55:49.040
<v Speaker 2>you haVe to become your own doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2806
01:55:49.380 --> 01:55:50.790
<v Speaker 2>And if I say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2807
01:55:50.791 --> 01:55:53.340
<v Speaker 2>I know how effective antidepressants</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

2808
01:55:53.370 --> 01:55:56.970
<v Speaker 2>how effective they are not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I say it people to slam me for</v>

2809
01:55:56.971 --> 01:55:57.271
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

2810
01:55:57.271 --> 01:55:57.781
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>

2811
01:55:57.781 --> 01:55:59.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not a doctor or whatever.</v>

2812
01:55:59.130 --> 01:56:01.530
<v Speaker 2>So what I'm saying to you is go out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>do your research on it,</v>

2813
01:56:01.531 --> 01:56:04.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and find out how effective or</v>

2814
01:56:04.501 --> 01:56:05.760
<v Speaker 2>noneffective your drug is.</v>

2815
01:56:05.850 --> 01:56:09.300
<v Speaker 2>It just seemed crazy that they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed to advertise and that seems like</v>

2816
01:56:09.301 --> 01:56:12.270
<v Speaker 2>something we have to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the amount of money that they have,</v>

2817
01:56:12.780 --> 01:56:14.190
<v Speaker 2>the amount.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the Woman,</v>

2818
01:56:16.150 --> 01:56:19.470
<v Speaker 2>the woman in the documentary whose niece</v>
<v Speaker 2>burned herself to death,</v>

2819
01:56:19.890 --> 01:56:21.590
<v Speaker 2>she said it best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2820
01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:23.100
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're drug pushers,</v>

2821
01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:26.090
<v Speaker 2>they're illegal drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was hurt right there.</v>

2822
01:56:26.130 --> 01:56:29.100
<v Speaker 2>Illegal drug pushers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that we allow them to</v>

2823
01:56:29.101 --> 01:56:31.560
<v Speaker 2>advertise on television like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's gotta stop.</v>

2824
01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:34.670
<v Speaker 2>It's gotta stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the most difficult temescal</v>

2825
01:56:34.690 --> 01:56:37.100
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we took tobacco off tv and you know,</v>

2826
01:56:37.110 --> 01:56:38.910
<v Speaker 2>we still have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we still have a huge,</v>

2827
01:56:38.911 --> 01:56:40.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's still a large amount of people</v>

2828
01:56:40.741 --> 01:56:42.150
<v Speaker 2>that die from smoking cigarettes or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

2829
01:56:42.151 --> 01:56:44.040
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of their freedom now.</v>

2830
01:56:44.041 --> 01:56:46.170
<v Speaker 2>It's like their choice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they know it's bad,</v>

2831
01:56:46.171 --> 01:56:49.260
<v Speaker 2>it has a warning on it says this could</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill you if used as directed.</v>

2832
01:56:49.260 --> 01:56:51.110
<v Speaker 2>This could kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2833
01:56:51.150 --> 01:56:52.790
<v Speaker 2>these pills aren't saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2834
01:56:52.830 --> 01:56:55.590
<v Speaker 2>they're not saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but documentaries like yours are,</v>

2835
01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:57.690
<v Speaker 2>and I think we need more stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2836
01:56:57.691 --> 01:57:01.170
<v Speaker 2>Me need more things like what you did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where people get ahold of it and they</v>

2837
01:57:01.171 --> 01:57:03.960
<v Speaker 2>watch it and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they listened to the message and they</v>

2838
01:57:03.961 --> 01:57:04.794
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

2839
01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:07.080
<v Speaker 2>There's this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this something that,</v>

2840
01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:08.790
<v Speaker 2>this is something that needs to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about.</v>

2841
01:57:09.150 --> 01:57:10.890
<v Speaker 2>This is something that you're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>hearing.</v>

2842
01:57:11.550 --> 01:57:13.080
<v Speaker 2>You're not hearing our leaders talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

2843
01:57:13.110 --> 01:57:15.660
<v Speaker 2>You're not hearing our politicians talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>about who are running for office,</v>

2844
01:57:15.661 --> 01:57:18.420
<v Speaker 2>are not talking about this massive</v>
<v Speaker 2>epidemic that's killing more people than</v>

2845
01:57:18.421 --> 01:57:21.300
<v Speaker 2>car accidents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was another interesting statistic</v>

2846
01:57:21.301 --> 01:57:25.950
<v Speaker 2>from your movie that pill overdose and</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill more people every year than car</v>

2847
01:57:25.951 --> 01:57:28.290
<v Speaker 2>accidents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm lucky I came out the other side and</v>

2848
01:57:28.291 --> 01:57:30.150
<v Speaker 2>my brother didn't know our brother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mad dog.</v>

2849
01:57:30.150 --> 01:57:31.670
<v Speaker 2>He didn't make it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make it out the other side.</v>

2850
01:57:31.671 --> 01:57:35.090
<v Speaker 2>And now my friends have lost two friends</v>
<v Speaker 2>to oxicon.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2852
01:57:37.170 --> 01:57:42.170
<v Speaker 2>and my goal is just to help people not</v>
<v Speaker 2>be in the predicament I was in.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's such a fucking,</v>

2860
01:58:00.891 --> 01:58:02.820
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a one guy acting really weird.</v>

01:58:02.821 --> 01:58:04.410
<v Speaker 2>If he have a friend That's acting</v>
<v Speaker 2>strange,</v>

2862
01:58:04.411 --> 01:58:08.220
<v Speaker 2>it's not showing up on time to certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that's avoiding you when you call</v>

2863
01:58:08.221 --> 01:58:10.080
<v Speaker 2>them and just not communicating with you</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

2864
01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:12.540
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have to try to figure</v>
<v Speaker 2>out a way to reach out to that person</v>

2865
01:58:12.541 --> 01:58:15.280
<v Speaker 2>because something's probably up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2866
01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:18.090
<v Speaker 2>rehab is very expensive and I want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell people,</v>

2867
01:58:18.150 --> 01:58:20.400
<v Speaker 2>don't use that as an excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't use like,</v>

2868
01:58:20.401 --> 01:58:22.200
<v Speaker 2>it's too expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't afford it.</v>

2869
01:58:22.201 --> 01:58:24.390
<v Speaker 2>Excuse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit me up and we'll figure out how to</v>

2870
01:58:24.391 --> 01:58:26.160
<v Speaker 2>get it done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a free.</v>

2871
01:58:26.161 --> 01:58:28.860
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's waYs to do these programs too,</v>

2872
01:58:28.861 --> 01:58:29.491
<v Speaker 2>I'd imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2873
01:58:29.491 --> 01:58:31.830
<v Speaker 2>There's ways to approach this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's government programs,</v>

2874
01:58:32.070 --> 01:58:35.100
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain insurance you can get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's a lot of things that a lot</v>

2875
01:58:35.101 --> 01:58:36.900
<v Speaker 2>of people don't know and they should</v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

2876
01:58:36.901 --> 01:58:38.900
<v Speaker 2>So if somebody out there struggling</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2877
01:58:39.200 --> 01:58:40.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel free to hit me up and I'll help as</v>

2878
01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:44.740
<v Speaker 2>people as I can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else do you think that people need</v>

2879
01:58:44.741 --> 01:58:49.741
<v Speaker 2>to know about the prescription drug</v>
<v Speaker 2>industry that you think is like a not,</v>

2880
01:58:51.300 --> 01:58:53.250
<v Speaker 2>not being talked about on a daily basis?</v>

2881
01:58:54.390 --> 01:58:56.830
<v Speaker 2>They're just being lied to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people are being lied to.</v>

2882
01:58:57.340 --> 01:59:00.760
<v Speaker 2>These studies that they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They only have to do two studies.</v>

2883
01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:05.300
<v Speaker 2>They only have to show the fda to</v>
<v Speaker 2>studies that are effective and biased.</v>

2884
01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:07.750
<v Speaker 2>When I say effective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just mean they have to be slightly</v>

2885
01:59:07.751 --> 01:59:11.680
<v Speaker 2>more effective than a sugar pill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means it could be just some crappy</v>

2886
01:59:11.681 --> 01:59:14.270
<v Speaker 2>drug and that could be the placebo</v>
<v Speaker 2>effects.</v>

2887
01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:15.790
<v Speaker 2>Somebody said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel better because I'm taking this.</v>

2888
01:59:15.791 --> 01:59:17.590
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's.</v>

2889
01:59:17.680 --> 01:59:21.190
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't seem like as much of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurdle as a drug companies make it out</v>

2890
01:59:21.191 --> 01:59:22.090
<v Speaker 2>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2891
01:59:22.091 --> 01:59:24.460
<v Speaker 2>it costs a lot of money to get a drug to</v>
<v Speaker 2>market,</v>

2892
01:59:24.461 --> 01:59:26.800
<v Speaker 2>like they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like a billion dollar sometimes</v>

2893
01:59:27.160 --> 01:59:31.300
<v Speaker 2>just to get a drug to the market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're going to make so much more</v>

2894
01:59:31.301 --> 01:59:34.630
<v Speaker 2>money off that and profit off of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then part of that money that the in</v>

2895
01:59:34.631 --> 01:59:35.800
<v Speaker 2>the research and development.</v>

2896
01:59:36.070 --> 01:59:38.770
<v Speaker 2>Well just put it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>last year,</v>

2897
01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:40.990
<v Speaker 2>I think it was last year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and John Oliver oliver said this,</v>

2898
01:59:40.991 --> 01:59:44.970
<v Speaker 2>John Oliver did a great piece on this on</v>
<v Speaker 2>his show and he says,</v>

2899
01:59:44.971 --> 01:59:46.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think last year that nine out of the</v>

2900
01:59:46.961 --> 01:59:51.370
<v Speaker 2>top 10 drug companies spent more money</v>
<v Speaker 2>on advertising than they did on research</v>

2901
01:59:51.371 --> 01:59:55.090
<v Speaker 2>and development.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big fuck you to all of us a big</v>

2902
01:59:55.091 --> 01:59:59.650
<v Speaker 2>fuck you right in all of our faces are</v>
<v Speaker 2>they save a lot of money for lawsuits</v>

2903
01:59:59.651 --> 02:00:01.600
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's likE the price is the price of</v>

2904
02:00:01.601 --> 02:00:03.850
<v Speaker 2>businesses is them to save a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

2905
02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:06.730
<v Speaker 2>put a lot of money away for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then they do the calculations.</v>

2906
02:00:06.731 --> 02:00:08.470
<v Speaker 2>They run the numbers and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2907
02:00:08.471 --> 02:00:11.680
<v Speaker 2>well if this many people try to sue us</v>
<v Speaker 2>for death or whatever the fuck it is,</v>

2908
02:00:11.681 --> 02:00:15.550
<v Speaker 2>their problem we're still going to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>out with with $4,000,000,000 or whatever</v>

2909
02:00:15.551 --> 02:00:16.384
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

2910
02:00:16.570 --> 02:00:18.800
<v Speaker 2>There's all kinds of crazy shit factored</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the,</v>

2911
02:00:19.030 --> 02:00:20.140
<v Speaker 2>to the profit margin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2912
02:00:20.141 --> 02:00:24.220
<v Speaker 2>if I sell a standard business practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like gm does that and stuff.</v>

2913
02:00:24.221 --> 02:00:25.310
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2914
02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:28.960
<v Speaker 2>it's just the way people do stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I make eight billioN dollars and I</v>

2915
02:00:28.961 --> 02:00:31.480
<v Speaker 2>lost two bIllion in a lawsuit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who cares?</v>

2916
02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:34.510
<v Speaker 2>It's $6,000,000,000 on top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2917
02:00:34.810 --> 02:00:36.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The studies,</v>

2918
02:00:36.341 --> 02:00:38.230
<v Speaker 2>the way you showed how they do their</v>
<v Speaker 2>studies too.</v>

2919
02:00:38.231 --> 02:00:42.160
<v Speaker 2>That was really an eye opening thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hundreds of studies and they don't have</v>

2920
02:00:42.161 --> 02:00:44.600
<v Speaker 2>to show you the results there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

2921
02:00:44.710 --> 02:00:46.330
<v Speaker 2>if there's nothing wrong with this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

2922
02:00:46.520 --> 02:00:50.800
<v Speaker 2>if I'm not being lied to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then why the fuck did the fda not do an</v>

2923
02:00:50.801 --> 02:00:53.300
<v Speaker 2>interview with me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did the dea you do it?</v>

2924
02:00:53.390 --> 02:00:54.380
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were.</v>

2925
02:00:54.390 --> 02:00:54.791
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2926
02:00:54.791 --> 02:00:57.100
<v Speaker 2>you can just look on our website.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All her shIt's on our website.</v>

2927
02:00:57.370 --> 02:00:58.240
<v Speaker 2>Are you fucking kidding me?</v>

2928
02:00:58.240 --> 02:01:00.250
<v Speaker 2>I want to do an interview with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk to you,</v>

2929
02:01:00.251 --> 02:01:03.490
<v Speaker 2>I want to ask your questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to ask the dea was responsible</v>

2930
02:01:03.491 --> 02:01:06.220
<v Speaker 2>for how many drugs are made each year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell,</v>

2931
02:01:06.430 --> 02:01:08.220
<v Speaker 2>what's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they won't.</v>

2932
02:01:08.500 --> 02:01:11.380
<v Speaker 2>These people are public servants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They work for us and they won't do</v>

2933
02:01:11.381 --> 02:01:13.000
<v Speaker 2>interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's bullshit.</v>

2934
02:01:13.001 --> 02:01:14.830
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's something that makes me</v>

2935
02:01:14.831 --> 02:01:17.230
<v Speaker 2>angry because like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had all these ideas for the movie.</v>

2936
02:01:17.410 --> 02:01:19.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to ask this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to ask this guy and they just</v>

2937
02:01:19.691 --> 02:01:21.340
<v Speaker 2>don't want to talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

2938
02:01:22.380 --> 02:01:23.560
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's disturbing.</v>

2939
02:01:23.561 --> 02:01:26.190
<v Speaker 2>Because you would feel like someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a public servant like that,</v>

2940
02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:29.650
<v Speaker 2>that they have an obligation to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they should have some sort of a pr</v>

2941
02:01:29.651 --> 02:01:32.290
<v Speaker 2>representative that has an obligation to</v>
<v Speaker 2>state their policy.</v>

2942
02:01:32.310 --> 02:01:34.320
<v Speaker 2>And the pr representative told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2943
02:01:34.630 --> 02:01:35.700
<v Speaker 2>like basically like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2944
02:01:35.710 --> 02:01:38.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not nbc and cbs.</v>

2945
02:01:38.250 --> 02:01:39.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm not hbo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2946
02:01:39.610 --> 02:01:40.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm always</v>

2947
02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:43.670
<v Speaker 1>do all my movies independently and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll bring them to somebody afterwards.</v>

2948
02:01:43.671 --> 02:01:47.150
<v Speaker 1>And so that's kind of a tough thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like not calling up and have the</v>

2949
02:01:47.151 --> 02:01:50.360
<v Speaker 1>credentials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to establish documentaries that</v>

2950
02:01:50.361 --> 02:01:52.070
<v Speaker 1>have done very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

2951
02:01:52.071 --> 02:01:54.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also think that people might have seen</v>

2952
02:01:54.801 --> 02:01:57.470
<v Speaker 1>those documentary and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not coming in our doors,</v>

2953
02:01:57.471 --> 02:01:59.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking troublemaker.</v>

2954
02:02:01.310 --> 02:02:03.710
<v Speaker 1>Throw us under the bus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2955
02:02:03.740 --> 02:02:05.750
<v Speaker 1>Just bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bizarre,</v>

2956
02:02:05.751 --> 02:02:08.470
<v Speaker 1>bizarre world we live in where this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the norm there,</v>

2957
02:02:08.550 --> 02:02:10.580
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these pills that people are taking these</v>

2958
02:02:10.581 --> 02:02:13.580
<v Speaker 1>consciousness altering pills that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to force down people's</v>

2959
02:02:13.581 --> 02:02:15.140
<v Speaker 1>throats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the other thing that I wanted</v>

2960
02:02:15.141 --> 02:02:20.120
<v Speaker 1>to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the connection between statens and like</v>

2961
02:02:20.150 --> 02:02:23.540
<v Speaker 1>how little statents work and the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that statens,</v>

2962
02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:27.830
<v Speaker 1>the people that sell them also sell</v>
<v Speaker 1>viagra will make you impotent.</v>

2963
02:02:28.730 --> 02:02:33.080
<v Speaker 1>They sell viagra to give you a bone or</v>
<v Speaker 1>afterward there's a new commercial too</v>

2964
02:02:33.081 --> 02:02:35.000
<v Speaker 1>with the constipation.</v>

2965
02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:37.700
<v Speaker 1>If you're taking opiate pills and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in and you're getting</v>

2966
02:02:37.701 --> 02:02:39.770
<v Speaker 1>constipated and you constantly have</v>
<v Speaker 1>another pill for you,</v>

2967
02:02:39.830 --> 02:02:42.760
<v Speaker 1>it's probably the same goddamn company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're taking a,</v>

2968
02:02:43.490 --> 02:02:44.960
<v Speaker 1>taking a psych bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not working.</v>

2969
02:02:44.961 --> 02:02:47.370
<v Speaker 1>You gotta throw abilify on top of not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll build a phi.</v>

2970
02:02:47.380 --> 02:02:50.050
<v Speaker 1>Supposed to be like really scary for</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to like.</v>

2971
02:02:50.060 --> 02:02:53.900
<v Speaker 1>It's all scary what the abilify's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of those ones that really gives you</v>

2972
02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:57.830
<v Speaker 1>a rabid suicide wait a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our doctors really telling me,</v>

2973
02:02:57.890 --> 02:03:00.680
<v Speaker 1>telling us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and me that we need to take an</v>

2974
02:03:00.681 --> 02:03:02.840
<v Speaker 1>antidepressant and if it doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it doesn't work,</v>

2975
02:03:02.841 --> 02:03:04.800
<v Speaker 1>take another antidepressant top of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know what,</v>

2976
02:03:04.820 --> 02:03:07.100
<v Speaker 1>don't smoke weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be bad.</v>

2977
02:03:07.101 --> 02:03:11.110
<v Speaker 1>it's bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like marijuana would fix.</v>

2978
02:03:11.150 --> 02:03:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Could fix those problems with anxiety</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stress and confused,</v>

2979
02:03:14.830 --> 02:03:15.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2980
02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:18.990
<v Speaker 1>Is marijuana fixing anxiety because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes me anxious as fuck.</v>

2981
02:03:19.590 --> 02:03:21.500
<v Speaker 1>Makes you paranoid a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2982
02:03:21.710 --> 02:03:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Well it makes me aware.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think that paranoia is just be</v>

2983
02:03:25.071 --> 02:03:28.700
<v Speaker 1>you being aware of how vulnerable you</v>
<v Speaker 1>really are and how crazy the world.</v>

2984
02:03:28.701 --> 02:03:31.970
<v Speaker 1>We started thinking of weird shit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>start thinking about it as you know what</v>

2985
02:03:31.971 --> 02:03:33.350
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but staten.</v>

2986
02:03:33.380 --> 02:03:36.870
<v Speaker 1>So statens don't really help you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well look at that low.</v>

2987
02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:38.840
<v Speaker 1>If you lower cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that gonna do for you?</v>

2988
02:03:39.770 --> 02:03:41.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's good cholesterol and bad</v>

2989
02:03:41.661 --> 02:03:44.180
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have this idea in our head that we</v>

2990
02:03:44.181 --> 02:03:47.360
<v Speaker 1>have to get rid of cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think getting like lowering your</v>

2991
02:03:47.361 --> 02:03:50.900
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol they say really doesn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>much of an effect on like whether or not</v>

2992
02:03:50.901 --> 02:03:53.090
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like one of the markers</v>

2993
02:03:53.091 --> 02:03:55.610
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I think that the problem is not as</v>

2994
02:03:55.740 --> 02:03:57.310
<v Speaker 1>big of a factor as they once thought.</v>

2995
02:03:57.410 --> 02:03:58.310
<v Speaker 1>The problem is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2996
02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:00.110
<v Speaker 1>do you really need to lower your</v>
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol?</v>

2997
02:04:00.111 --> 02:04:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Do you really need to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he'll fix your diet and do it</v>

2998
02:04:03.171 --> 02:04:06.290
<v Speaker 1>through other ways that's responsible</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a lot of brain function is</v>

2999
02:04:06.291 --> 02:04:11.291
<v Speaker 1>responsible for all testosterone cream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3000
02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:12.610
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3001
02:04:12.610 --> 02:04:15.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's cholesterol and trIglycerides,</v>

3002
02:04:15.281 --> 02:04:17.330
<v Speaker 1>it's of go through the roof just because</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor eating habits,</v>

3003
02:04:17.331 --> 02:04:19.220
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily because they eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>saturated fats,</v>

3004
02:04:19.740 --> 02:04:21.590
<v Speaker 1>saturated fats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing that people keep</v>

3005
02:04:21.591 --> 02:04:23.030
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saturated fats are bad for you.</v>

3006
02:04:23.060 --> 02:04:25.130
<v Speaker 1>The parent old studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3007
02:04:25.131 --> 02:04:27.080
<v Speaker 1>they're not bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saturated fats are,</v>

3008
02:04:27.380 --> 02:04:31.520
<v Speaker 1>it depends entirely on what your eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what your body requirements are.</v>

3009
02:04:31.521 --> 02:04:34.910
<v Speaker 1>If you eat too much of anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get fat and that's not</v>

3010
02:04:35.010 --> 02:04:36.980
<v Speaker 1>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your saturated fats from pizza,</v>

3011
02:04:36.990 --> 02:04:39.480
<v Speaker 1>it's probably not the best option</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're eating like four or five</v>

3012
02:04:39.481 --> 02:04:42.840
<v Speaker 1>times a day or something that I love</v>
<v Speaker 1>pizza.</v>

3013
02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:44.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all adults,</v>

3014
02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:46.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we're all learning from other adults</v>

3015
02:04:46.831 --> 02:04:47.491
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3016
02:04:47.491 --> 02:04:50.340
<v Speaker 1>our parents and our parent's parents</v>
<v Speaker 1>that didn't have much fucking</v>

3017
02:04:50.341 --> 02:04:53.250
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're growing up with these people</v>

3018
02:04:53.251 --> 02:04:55.020
<v Speaker 1>that really didn't know what they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

3019
02:04:55.320 --> 02:04:58.500
<v Speaker 1>They really didn't have any idea where</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're eating sugary cereal for breakfast</v>

3020
02:04:58.501 --> 02:05:03.501
<v Speaker 1>and we just didn't know studies that our</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents had in the 19 sixties in the 19</v>

3021
02:05:04.201 --> 02:05:05.820
<v Speaker 1>seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they had to go on,</v>

3022
02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.280
<v Speaker 1>the information that they were they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>given.</v>

3023
02:05:08.370 --> 02:05:11.880
<v Speaker 1>It's just so poor in comparison to what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know now have was up.</v>

3024
02:05:16.020 --> 02:05:18.000
<v Speaker 1>They want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was saying I have a projecT I want to</v>

3025
02:05:18.001 --> 02:05:19.250
<v Speaker 1>do that basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3026
02:05:19.380 --> 02:05:22.080
<v Speaker 1>one day you'll read in the newspaper</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you should drink coffee.</v>

3027
02:05:22.081 --> 02:05:24.580
<v Speaker 1>It has all these health benefits and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next day you'll read it as bad for you.</v>

3028
02:05:24.581 --> 02:05:27.300
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you hAve all these conflicting things</v>

3029
02:05:27.301 --> 02:05:29.070
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go vegan and don't go vegan,</v>

3030
02:05:29.071 --> 02:05:30.540
<v Speaker 1>do keto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>

3031
02:05:30.590 --> 02:05:33.420
<v Speaker 1>And nobody really knows the truth that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know the truth.</v>

3032
02:05:33.421 --> 02:05:36.810
<v Speaker 1>So like that's what I want to do is go</v>
<v Speaker 1>out and seek a basis basically do</v>

3033
02:05:36.811 --> 02:05:40.890
<v Speaker 1>mythbusters in the world of health and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fitness because there are people out</v>

3034
02:05:40.891 --> 02:05:44.240
<v Speaker 1>there that no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just have to go find them and expose</v>

3035
02:05:44.340 --> 02:05:45.810
<v Speaker 1>them to the world so other people can</v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

3036
02:05:46.050 --> 02:05:50.550
<v Speaker 1>There are a few people out there that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a really good understanding of most</v>

3037
02:05:50.551 --> 02:05:51.560
<v Speaker 1>of what they're talking about.</v>

3038
02:05:52.030 --> 02:05:54.180
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is when it comes to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>human body,</v>

3039
02:05:54.181 --> 02:05:57.180
<v Speaker 1>there's so many fucking variables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's also so many different</v>

3040
02:05:57.181 --> 02:05:59.670
<v Speaker 1>types of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some people that just,</v>

3041
02:05:59.700 --> 02:06:02.610
<v Speaker 1>they need different nutritional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have different nutritional</v>

3042
02:06:02.611 --> 02:06:06.090
<v Speaker 1>requirements that maybe you do or I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just no getting around that.</v>

3043
02:06:06.120 --> 02:06:09.060
<v Speaker 1>We always talk about our friend dr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lane norton who uh,</v>

3044
02:06:09.150 --> 02:06:12.150
<v Speaker 1>kinda brought flexible dieting to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>forefront of most sure how familiar you</v>

3045
02:06:12.151 --> 02:06:14.340
<v Speaker 1>are with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But basically it's almost like</v>

3046
02:06:14.370 --> 02:06:17.430
<v Speaker 1>weightwatchers in a way where it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have all kinds of things.</v>

3047
02:06:17.431 --> 02:06:19.270
<v Speaker 1>You can eat some pizza,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have some ice cream,</v>

3048
02:06:19.271 --> 02:06:20.700
<v Speaker 1>you can eat steak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you eat chicken,</v>

3049
02:06:20.701 --> 02:06:24.840
<v Speaker 1>you can eat all over the map as long as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of fitting within a calorie</v>

3050
02:06:25.380 --> 02:06:26.860
<v Speaker 1>macros as long as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3051
02:06:26.870 --> 02:06:29.670
<v Speaker 1>as long as it fits your macros,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as it fits your caloric intake</v>

3052
02:06:29.671 --> 02:06:31.830
<v Speaker 1>for the day and let's not be stupid</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

3053
02:06:31.831 --> 02:06:34.800
<v Speaker 1>You can't be eating junk everyday all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

3054
02:06:34.820 --> 02:06:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people take his stuff out of context,</v>

3055
02:06:36.901 --> 02:06:37.570
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll say,</v>

3056
02:06:37.570 --> 02:06:39.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they post pictures of pop tarts and say</v>

3057
02:06:39.901 --> 02:06:41.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm on flexible dieting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>

3058
02:06:41.491 --> 02:06:43.800
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't post a 95 percent of the</v>

3059
02:06:43.801 --> 02:06:46.760
<v Speaker 1>stuff that you ate that was healthy</v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken and rice or whatever,</v>

3060
02:06:46.810 --> 02:06:48.090
<v Speaker 1>or like vegan oreos.</v>

3061
02:06:50.510 --> 02:06:53.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think though that there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>trend that people kind of understanding</v>

3062
02:06:53.461 --> 02:06:56.250
<v Speaker 1>this a little bit More now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least it's starting to gain momentum.</v>

3063
02:06:56.251 --> 02:06:59.430
<v Speaker 1>You've seen people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrating on organic vegetables.</v>

3064
02:06:59.520 --> 02:07:01.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even just like the seminar that I did</v>

3065
02:07:01.861 --> 02:07:03.270
<v Speaker 1>where there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many people there.</v>

3066
02:07:03.271 --> 02:07:06.510
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shitload of people there.</v>

3067
02:07:06.511 --> 02:07:07.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

3068
02:07:07.561 --> 02:07:09.210
<v Speaker 1>if I did a power thing seminar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't,</v>

3069
02:07:09.270 --> 02:07:11.560
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't beg people to go to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

3070
02:07:11.650 --> 02:07:13.380
<v Speaker 1>there's women there now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's girls,</v>

3071
02:07:13.381 --> 02:07:14.071
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like weird.</v>

3072
02:07:14.071 --> 02:07:16.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like I figured out the way to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>that big juicy ass.</v>

3073
02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:19.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not a whole lot of teenagers,</v>

3074
02:07:20.010 --> 02:07:24.380
<v Speaker 1>white women are evolving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would go into these power lifting</v>

3075
02:07:24.410 --> 02:07:27.420
<v Speaker 1>meets again that ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

3076
02:07:27.421 --> 02:07:28.380
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's changing.</v>

3077
02:07:28.381 --> 02:07:30.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are starting to learn that</v>

3078
02:07:30.151 --> 02:07:32.170
<v Speaker 1>strength is important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even as you get older,</v>

3079
02:07:32.171 --> 02:07:34.120
<v Speaker 1>as you get into their forties and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fifties and sixties,</v>

3080
02:07:34.530 --> 02:07:36.040
<v Speaker 1>more important because you need</v>

3081
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:38.830
<v Speaker 3>to keep your bone density and keep your</v>
<v Speaker 3>muscle mass and it's important for</v>

3082
02:07:38.831 --> 02:07:39.520
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3083
02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:41.230
<v Speaker 3>they have osteoporosis and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3084
02:07:41.231 --> 02:07:46.120
<v Speaker 3>Eyes When you go on vacation and you go</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the pool and their bodies are just</v>

3085
02:07:46.180 --> 02:07:48.760
<v Speaker 3>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shoulders don't exist.</v>

3086
02:07:48.780 --> 02:07:50.770
<v Speaker 3>It's like old women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to run up to him and put</v>

3087
02:07:50.771 --> 02:07:53.200
<v Speaker 3>them in an americano and just ripped her</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoulder apart because it's just,</v>

3088
02:07:53.230 --> 02:07:54.650
<v Speaker 3>it's not attached to anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3089
02:07:54.880 --> 02:07:59.880
<v Speaker 3>It just seems like it's like loosely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just feel like you're not together.</v>

3090
02:08:02.620 --> 02:08:03.820
<v Speaker 3>If you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never do that.</v>

3091
02:08:03.821 --> 02:08:04.361
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just kidding.</v>

3092
02:08:04.361 --> 02:08:06.520
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean you look at their bodies,</v>

3093
02:08:06.521 --> 02:08:07.131
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my god,</v>

3094
02:08:07.131 --> 02:08:10.630
<v Speaker 3>if this guy has to pick up anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his body's going to break and this is a</v>

3095
02:08:10.660 --> 02:08:13.810
<v Speaker 3>guy who at one point in time was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>teenager who was a young,</v>

3096
02:08:13.990 --> 02:08:16.610
<v Speaker 3>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vibrant kid parking on the railroad or</v>

3097
02:08:17.100 --> 02:08:21.220
<v Speaker 3>doing some bass and maybe it's just been</v>
<v Speaker 3>gross as whole life,</v>

3098
02:08:21.800 --> 02:08:23.290
<v Speaker 3>but you see people as they get older.</v>

3099
02:08:23.290 --> 02:08:26.090
<v Speaker 3>My point is that if you live that</v>
<v Speaker 3>sedentary lifestyle and you sitting in</v>

3100
02:08:26.091 --> 02:08:28.750
<v Speaker 3>an office all day and if you're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>making your body work,</v>

3101
02:08:28.780 --> 02:08:32.800
<v Speaker 3>it's going to fucking atrophy and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna break down and pick some stuff up.</v>

3102
02:08:32.801 --> 02:08:34.570
<v Speaker 3>Do some squats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>airport.</v>

3103
02:08:34.660 --> 02:08:37.150
<v Speaker 3>When you go to the airport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you realize how unhealthy this country</v>

3104
02:08:37.151 --> 02:08:38.620
<v Speaker 3>is because people are coming from</v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>

3105
02:08:39.060 --> 02:08:41.470
<v Speaker 3>I go to the air like what was just in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the airport in Ohio and I'm like,</v>

3106
02:08:41.600 --> 02:08:42.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not a lot of healthy.</v>

3107
02:08:43.260 --> 02:08:45.880
<v Speaker 3>Ohio's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about disneyland?</v>

3108
02:08:47.160 --> 02:08:51.160
<v Speaker 3>And it's sad because you're only making</v>
<v Speaker 3>up one percent of the people.</v>

3109
02:08:51.410 --> 02:08:53.070
<v Speaker 3>If you see somebody who's kind of jackie</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3110
02:08:53.080 --> 02:08:53.711
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's up man?</v>

3111
02:08:53.711 --> 02:08:55.250
<v Speaker 3>Because it's rarely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>only ones.</v>

3112
02:08:55.870 --> 02:08:57.100
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how about when you go to disneyland?</v>

3113
02:08:57.101 --> 02:08:58.630
<v Speaker 3>It seems like a scooter festival.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

3114
02:08:58.900 --> 02:09:00.610
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's on scooters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These people,</v>

3115
02:09:00.611 --> 02:09:03.610
<v Speaker 3>there's so many people that have eaten</v>
<v Speaker 3>their way out of walking.</v>

3116
02:09:03.980 --> 02:09:06.150
<v Speaker 3>They don't walk anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're oozing over the side.</v>

3117
02:09:07.250 --> 02:09:10.210
<v Speaker 3>It's what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you could say all day that it's a</v>

3118
02:09:10.211 --> 02:09:12.190
<v Speaker 3>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could say all but this.</v>

3119
02:09:12.200 --> 02:09:14.590
<v Speaker 3>It's real simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're putting too much food in your</v>

3120
02:09:14.591 --> 02:09:16.120
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your body is getting too big.</v>

3121
02:09:16.330 --> 02:09:19.960
<v Speaker 3>It's really simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well getting so big that like fat is now</v>

3122
02:09:19.961 --> 02:09:23.530
<v Speaker 3>growing in some odd places and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean people's bodies are or not even</v>

3123
02:09:23.950 --> 02:09:26.390
<v Speaker 3>no longer in the shape of a of a normal</v>
<v Speaker 3>human being,</v>

3124
02:09:26.391 --> 02:09:28.690
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not trying to fat shame people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's.</v>

3125
02:09:29.020 --> 02:09:31.330
<v Speaker 3>That's the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't even say that word because it's</v>

3126
02:09:31.331 --> 02:09:33.310
<v Speaker 3>not shaming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so dumb.</v>

3127
02:09:33.550 --> 02:09:36.730
<v Speaker 3>If you shame them into losing weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's probably beneficial to their</v>

3128
02:09:36.731 --> 02:09:39.640
<v Speaker 3>health.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not the way to do the best way to</v>

3129
02:09:39.641 --> 02:09:41.530
<v Speaker 3>do it necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think people,</v>

3130
02:09:41.531 --> 02:09:43.240
<v Speaker 3>because they're lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fit shame people,</v>

3131
02:09:43.241 --> 02:09:44.520
<v Speaker 3>like they'll see him walking down the</v>
<v Speaker 3>street.</v>

3132
02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:47.010
<v Speaker 3>They'll the first day that they'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>discount all the work,</v>

3133
02:09:47.020 --> 02:09:49.180
<v Speaker 3>like all the steroids are now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll say like,</v>

3134
02:09:49.290 --> 02:09:50.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not healthy.</v>

3135
02:09:50.381 --> 02:09:51.980
<v Speaker 3>Look at that guy or anybody that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>leading.</v>

3136
02:09:51.981 --> 02:09:52.411
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3137
02:09:52.411 --> 02:09:53.900
<v Speaker 3>he cares about it as a gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3138
02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:55.840
<v Speaker 3>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think you're dumb because you</v>

3139
02:09:55.841 --> 02:09:57.580
<v Speaker 3>weren't going to meet him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You must be dumb.</v>

3140
02:09:57.730 --> 02:09:59.200
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know this guy is a bodybuilder,</v>

3141
02:09:59.201 --> 02:10:00.610
<v Speaker 3>but he's also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has a phd.</v>

3142
02:10:00.630 --> 02:10:03.930
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people will think he's dumb and</v>

3143
02:10:03.970 --> 02:10:04.900
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>

3144
02:10:05.190 --> 02:10:06.580
<v Speaker 3>we Just shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3145
02:10:06.590 --> 02:10:08.590
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody wants everybody else to have</v>

3146
02:10:08.591 --> 02:10:11.190
<v Speaker 3>soMe sort of a deficit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this guy's rich yet,</v>

3147
02:10:11.191 --> 02:10:12.820
<v Speaker 3>but I heard he's got no dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>

3148
02:10:12.970 --> 02:10:13.803
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

3149
02:10:13.870 --> 02:10:16.990
<v Speaker 3>Always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>always have to play when they can't fInd</v>

3150
02:10:16.991 --> 02:10:17.890
<v Speaker 3>a flaw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do they say?</v>

3151
02:10:18.090 --> 02:10:19.540
<v Speaker 3>Dump con.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a bitch.</v>

3152
02:10:23.040 --> 02:10:26.580
<v Speaker 3>She's a whore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always going to be there.</v>

3153
02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:29.890
<v Speaker 3>It's always going to be that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But just I feel like people are more</v>

3154
02:10:29.891 --> 02:10:32.320
<v Speaker 3>conscious about their diet now than</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've ever been before and they're</v>

3155
02:10:32.321 --> 02:10:34.130
<v Speaker 3>more conscious about it because it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of been</v>

3156
02:10:34.430 --> 02:10:37.250
<v Speaker 2>getting out there in the public where it</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't before,</v>

3157
02:10:37.251 --> 02:10:38.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

3158
02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:40.790
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is very important and it is hard to</v>

3159
02:10:40.791 --> 02:10:44.450
<v Speaker 2>go to a grocery store and find the</v>
<v Speaker 2>actual things.</v>

3160
02:10:44.451 --> 02:10:45.081
<v Speaker 2>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3161
02:10:45.081 --> 02:10:47.180
<v Speaker 2>like you want to get things that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3162
02:10:47.181 --> 02:10:49.880
<v Speaker 2>they don't have preservatives or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever and you have to like look for</v>

3163
02:10:49.881 --> 02:10:50.151
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3164
02:10:50.151 --> 02:10:52.400
<v Speaker 2>So you're kind of a hunter gatherer</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

3165
02:10:52.401 --> 02:10:54.800
<v Speaker 2>trying to hunt in the grocery store for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shit that's good.</v>

3166
02:10:54.860 --> 02:10:58.340
<v Speaker 2>It's exciting for us because we've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in this for over 20 years.</v>

3167
02:10:58.490 --> 02:11:00.460
<v Speaker 2>And then finally people are starting to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're like,</v>

3168
02:11:00.470 --> 02:11:01.790
<v Speaker 2>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're talking about stuff.</v>

3169
02:11:01.791 --> 02:11:03.830
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about two decades ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How coMe?</v>

3170
02:11:04.040 --> 02:11:07.710
<v Speaker 2>How come it's not mandatory to be taken</v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrition all through school?</v>

3171
02:11:07.711 --> 02:11:10.460
<v Speaker 2>Like it's just like ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like oh there's no time for that.</v>

3172
02:11:10.461 --> 02:11:13.490
<v Speaker 2>we have to teach you who the presidents</v>
<v Speaker 2>were and we got to teach you all this</v>

3173
02:11:13.491 --> 02:11:16.850
<v Speaker 2>other things that you're never going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>use and why not nutrition from a</v>

3174
02:11:16.851 --> 02:11:20.630
<v Speaker 2>documentary on sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar,</v>

3175
02:11:20.631 --> 02:11:21.464
<v Speaker 2>sugar.</v>

3176
02:11:21.620 --> 02:11:24.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched it with my kids were lIke,</v>

3177
02:11:24.321 --> 02:11:26.660
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My sugar film at the same company,</v>

3178
02:11:26.661 --> 02:11:30.020
<v Speaker 2>samuel goldwyn that did prescription</v>
<v Speaker 2>thugs put that out and it's cool because</v>

3179
02:11:30.021 --> 02:11:32.510
<v Speaker 2>that company is just looking for</v>
<v Speaker 2>important things to put out.</v>

3180
02:11:32.680 --> 02:11:34.190
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very important.</v>

3181
02:11:34.380 --> 02:11:36.510
<v Speaker 2>The sugars are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My kids,</v>

3182
02:11:36.520 --> 02:11:38.460
<v Speaker 2>when they were really young that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

3183
02:11:38.660 --> 02:11:40.520
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of food and excess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3184
02:11:40.521 --> 02:11:43.130
<v Speaker 2>junk food is gonna make you fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kept saYing that over and over again.</v>

3185
02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:45.350
<v Speaker 2>Now they're older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't say it because I don't want</v>

3186
02:11:45.351 --> 02:11:47.240
<v Speaker 2>them to have some sort of weird complex</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it anymore,</v>

3187
02:11:47.270 --> 02:11:50.810
<v Speaker 2>but they know they got the information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get the message got across.</v>

3188
02:11:50.811 --> 02:11:54.500
<v Speaker 2>They're eight and 12 now and so we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of just put it in their head.</v>

3189
02:11:54.560 --> 02:11:57.920
<v Speaker 2>That feeling that you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that feels good when you take it in</v>

3190
02:11:57.980 --> 02:12:02.180
<v Speaker 2>healthy versus getting sick and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the feeling that you get that feels</v>

3191
02:12:02.181 --> 02:12:04.250
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you eat sugary foods like that</v>

3192
02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:08.240
<v Speaker 2>corresponds with a crash and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>crashes really bad for you.</v>

3193
02:12:08.390 --> 02:12:10.280
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like now think about that.</v>

3194
02:12:10.281 --> 02:12:11.900
<v Speaker 2>Next time you eat ice cream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can enjoy it,</v>

3195
02:12:12.140 --> 02:12:14.870
<v Speaker 2>but understand that you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>something bad to your body because most</v>

3196
02:12:14.871 --> 02:12:15.950
<v Speaker 2>kids don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>

3197
02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:19.310
<v Speaker 2>they just the good part and then they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to realize one day that there's a</v>

3198
02:12:19.311 --> 02:12:20.920
<v Speaker 2>bad part to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the.</v>

3199
02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:23.320
<v Speaker 2>You have to teach them that if you mix</v>
<v Speaker 2>it with painkillers,</v>

3200
02:12:23.321 --> 02:12:24.154
<v Speaker 2>it feels great.</v>

3201
02:12:26.450 --> 02:12:27.950
<v Speaker 2>That was the other thing in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary,</v>

3202
02:12:27.951 --> 02:12:31.290
<v Speaker 2>they're showing the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how quickly they get kids on</v>

3203
02:12:31.340 --> 02:12:34.990
<v Speaker 2>like children's claraton</v>
<v Speaker 2>disapprove,</v>

3204
02:12:36.060 --> 02:12:39.410
<v Speaker 2>approve oxycontin for like 11 to 16 year</v>
<v Speaker 2>olds.</v>

3205
02:12:39.411 --> 02:12:41.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well here's what the problem is,</v>

3206
02:12:41.721 --> 02:12:43.580
<v Speaker 2>here's what people are saying and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>

3207
02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:44.631
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well,</v>

3208
02:12:44.631 --> 02:12:48.660
<v Speaker 2>it just makes it easier for a doctor to</v>
<v Speaker 2>prescribe oxycontin to a cancer patient.</v>

3209
02:12:48.661 --> 02:12:51.620
<v Speaker 2>Like you're telling me that the fda is</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to come down and a doctor for</v>

3210
02:12:51.621 --> 02:12:53.920
<v Speaker 2>prescribing oxycontin to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>

3211
02:12:54.080 --> 02:12:56.240
<v Speaker 2>he's going to die from cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't think so.</v>

3212
02:12:56.241 --> 02:12:56.841
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

3213
02:12:56.841 --> 02:12:58.520
<v Speaker 2>maybe maybe they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

3214
02:12:58.521 --> 02:13:02.210
<v Speaker 2>it's so crazy because all that's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do is create a bigger epidemic.</v>

3215
02:13:02.260 --> 02:13:04.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very aware of them for sales.</v>

3216
02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:06.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're very aware of that.</v>

3217
02:13:06.051 --> 02:13:08.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>needed to happen.</v>

3218
02:13:08.211 --> 02:13:09.550
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3219
02:13:09.570 --> 02:13:11.570
<v Speaker 2>these kids that we've been thought of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3220
02:13:12.140 --> 02:13:14.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some fucking monster to somebody that</v>

3221
02:13:14.241 --> 02:13:15.700
<v Speaker 2>makes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes the drug right.</v>

3222
02:13:15.720 --> 02:13:18.710
<v Speaker 2>No one else hAs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The lobbies are the Most powerful thing</v>

3223
02:13:18.711 --> 02:13:20.090
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what's.</v>

3224
02:13:20.270 --> 02:13:22.820
<v Speaker 2>Was there anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything surprising when you were doing</v>

3225
02:13:22.821 --> 02:13:24.560
<v Speaker 2>this documentary?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was there anything that really,</v>

3226
02:13:25.250 --> 02:13:27.320
<v Speaker 2>really took you by surprise?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3227
02:13:27.340 --> 02:13:28.173
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

3228
02:13:28.440 --> 02:13:30.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what took me by surprise,</v>

3229
02:13:30.550 --> 02:13:33.930
<v Speaker 2>I relapsed during the documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was something that I didn't think</v>

3230
02:13:33.931 --> 02:13:35.100
<v Speaker 2>would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

3231
02:13:35.101 --> 02:13:36.150
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

3232
02:13:36.250 --> 02:13:37.850
<v Speaker 2>that was the trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What start,</v>

3233
02:13:37.860 --> 02:13:40.830
<v Speaker 2>what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hip replacement know what happened</v>

3234
02:13:40.831 --> 02:13:41.664
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3235
02:13:41.670 --> 02:13:42.510
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3236
02:13:42.511 --> 02:13:46.590
<v Speaker 2>So I was taking a lot of prescription</v>
<v Speaker 2>painkillers right from my hip</v>

3237
02:13:46.770 --> 02:13:49.530
<v Speaker 2>replacement surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fast forward about five years.</v>

3238
02:13:49.531 --> 02:13:51.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm on them for a pretty long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>

3239
02:13:51.211 --> 02:13:54.750
<v Speaker 2>Had to get my right hip replaced again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had three hip surgeries,</v>

3240
02:13:54.751 --> 02:13:57.330
<v Speaker 2>not just to have both hips done and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

3241
02:13:57.331 --> 02:13:59.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another hip two years later.</v>

3242
02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:01.290
<v Speaker 2>So it was constantly painkiller,</v>
<v Speaker 2>painkiller,</v>

3243
02:14:01.291 --> 02:14:03.570
<v Speaker 2>painkiller because dr after the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>hip surgery,</v>

3244
02:14:03.571 --> 02:14:06.840
<v Speaker 2>never knew what was wrong with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just this perpetual cycle,</v>

3245
02:14:06.841 --> 02:14:07.171
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3246
02:14:07.171 --> 02:14:08.790
<v Speaker 2>your hip is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two years later,</v>

3247
02:14:08.791 --> 02:14:09.624
<v Speaker 2>my doctor called me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

3248
02:14:09.650 --> 02:14:10.530
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

3249
02:14:10.531 --> 02:14:11.610
<v Speaker 2>we screwed that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

3250
02:14:11.611 --> 02:14:15.390
<v Speaker 2>There's actually you're the socket never</v>
<v Speaker 2>grew in properly and it's moving and</v>

3251
02:14:15.391 --> 02:14:18.690
<v Speaker 2>that's why you're having so much pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I felt like I was on fire</v>

3252
02:14:18.691 --> 02:14:19.770
<v Speaker 2>for two years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3253
02:14:19.771 --> 02:14:21.330
<v Speaker 2>like my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my hip was on fire.</v>

3254
02:14:21.750 --> 02:14:22.583
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3255
02:14:22.650 --> 02:14:25.350
<v Speaker 2>that was a big part of the drug</v>
<v Speaker 2>addiction.</v>

3256
02:14:25.351 --> 02:14:28.110
<v Speaker 2>And then I basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by my best friend,</v>

3257
02:14:28.111 --> 02:14:28.911
<v Speaker 2>leland was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3258
02:14:28.911 --> 02:14:30.240
<v Speaker 2>a guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3259
02:14:30.241 --> 02:14:30.630
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3260
02:14:30.630 --> 02:14:31.350
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3261
02:14:31.350 --> 02:14:33.670
<v Speaker 2>he was prescribed painkillers to and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>knew what he was doing.</v>

3262
02:14:33.950 --> 02:14:36.240
<v Speaker 2>He knew it was never wanting to overdo</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

3263
02:14:36.270 --> 02:14:37.300
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3264
02:14:37.410 --> 02:14:39.420
<v Speaker 2>but I just remember one day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3265
02:14:39.930 --> 02:14:41.340
<v Speaker 2>I told him like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to quit these.</v>

3266
02:14:41.340 --> 02:14:42.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3267
02:14:42.900 --> 02:14:44.610
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would get prescribed painkillers.</v>

3268
02:14:44.611 --> 02:14:46.950
<v Speaker 2>So I would try to get them from him and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would say,</v>

3269
02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:47.251
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3270
02:14:47.251 --> 02:14:48.270
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've cut you off,</v>

3271
02:14:48.271 --> 02:14:49.104
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're done.</v>

3272
02:14:49.290 --> 02:14:51.410
<v Speaker 2>and I just realized I needed to get off</v>
<v Speaker 2>those painkillers.</v>

3273
02:14:51.420 --> 02:14:53.460
<v Speaker 2>I was going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I went on suboxone and that was like</v>

3274
02:14:53.550 --> 02:14:57.450
<v Speaker 2>another year on suboxone and then while</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on suboxone that doctor put me on</v>

3275
02:14:57.451 --> 02:15:00.690
<v Speaker 2>like eight other drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a columbia pan and all these other</v>

3276
02:15:00.691 --> 02:15:03.030
<v Speaker 2>powerful crazy drugs where I banged up</v>
<v Speaker 2>my car,</v>

3277
02:15:03.470 --> 02:15:04.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>driving around.</v>

3278
02:15:04.231 --> 02:15:07.290
<v Speaker 2>So it was like a constant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perpetual mixed of these prescription</v>

3279
02:15:07.291 --> 02:15:09.810
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I decided to get off everything</v>

3280
02:15:10.260 --> 02:15:14.670
<v Speaker 2>and get clean and I felt like when I did</v>
<v Speaker 2>get clean I felt like I could never</v>

3281
02:15:14.671 --> 02:15:16.860
<v Speaker 2>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I started drinking like a fish,</v>

3282
02:15:16.910 --> 02:15:19.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was drinking vodka full thing of vodka</v>

3283
02:15:19.261 --> 02:15:20.490
<v Speaker 2>every day to sleep.</v>

3284
02:15:20.550 --> 02:15:23.300
<v Speaker 2>He had to go to sleep and stop My mind</v>
<v Speaker 2>from racing.</v>

3285
02:15:23.310 --> 02:15:26.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did that to work and that didn't work.</v>

3286
02:15:26.280 --> 02:15:28.800
<v Speaker 2>so I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it became a very heavy.</v>

3287
02:15:28.801 --> 02:15:33.630
<v Speaker 2>I became a very heavy drinker and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would get these crazy hangovers and</v>

3288
02:15:33.631 --> 02:15:34.920
<v Speaker 2>that's what I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3289
02:15:34.921 --> 02:15:36.360
<v Speaker 2>what cures the hangover?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Xanax.</v>

3290
02:15:36.361 --> 02:15:36.830
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

3291
02:15:36.830 --> 02:15:39.110
<v Speaker 2>that really works for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

3292
02:15:39.330 --> 02:15:43.080
<v Speaker 2>I would go on craigslist and I would buy</v>
<v Speaker 2>xanax from a kid in sun valley,</v>

3293
02:15:43.081 --> 02:15:44.820
<v Speaker 2>which is like way the fuck out from</v>
<v Speaker 2>venice.</v>

3294
02:15:44.850 --> 02:15:48.270
<v Speaker 2>You can buy xanax on craigslist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has that x oxycontin.</v>

3295
02:15:48.271 --> 02:15:50.060
<v Speaker 2>I showed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I showed that in my documentary that</v>

3296
02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:52.570
<v Speaker 2>that was something that does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The congressman was like,</v>

3297
02:15:52.600 --> 02:15:54.200
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the movie.</v>

3298
02:15:54.201 --> 02:15:55.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they stopped doing it.</v>

3299
02:15:55.261 --> 02:15:57.030
<v Speaker 2>But you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew about it because I was doing it.</v>

3300
02:15:57.090 --> 02:15:58.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what happened was I lied to him.</v>

3301
02:15:58.680 --> 02:15:59.080
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3302
02:15:59.080 --> 02:16:01.710
<v Speaker 2>I used to do that like three years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just did it three days ago.</v>

3303
02:16:03.330 --> 02:16:05.220
<v Speaker 2>And you'll become a good liar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3304
02:16:05.221 --> 02:16:07.460
<v Speaker 2>when you're addicted to drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was trying,</v>

3305
02:16:07.500 --> 02:16:09.120
<v Speaker 2>it was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a weird thing.</v>

3306
02:16:09.121 --> 02:16:11.730
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to make a difference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was still doing shit,</v>

3307
02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:12.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know how to stop.</v>

3308
02:16:12.870 --> 02:16:17.010
<v Speaker 2>That just seems so crazy that you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>buy drugs on craigslist.</v>

3309
02:16:17.160 --> 02:16:18.240
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3310
02:16:19.230 --> 02:16:20.330
<v Speaker 2>I say in the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they,</v>

3311
02:16:20.380 --> 02:16:24.050
<v Speaker 2>they had shut down the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>prostitution thing on craigslist.</v>

3312
02:16:24.060 --> 02:16:25.800
<v Speaker 2>Why don't they just shut down selling</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs,</v>

3313
02:16:25.801 --> 02:16:27.420
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why did they shut down the prostitution</v>

3314
02:16:27.421 --> 02:16:28.260
<v Speaker 2>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3315
02:16:28.700 --> 02:16:32.000
<v Speaker 2>Seemed like a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just went over to backpage.com now.</v>

3316
02:16:32.100 --> 02:16:33.070
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you,</v>

3317
02:16:33.220 --> 02:16:34.480
<v Speaker 2>you let everybody know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3318
02:16:34.640 --> 02:16:36.220
<v Speaker 2>there's a service.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was there anything else that was</v>

3319
02:16:36.221 --> 02:16:37.240
<v Speaker 2>surprising?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were doing it.</v>

3320
02:16:38.200 --> 02:16:39.033
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

3321
02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:41.200
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of it was surprising like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the woman,</v>

3322
02:16:41.201 --> 02:16:43.990
<v Speaker 2>glen olsen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was the pharma rep who basically,</v>

3323
02:16:43.991 --> 02:16:44.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3324
02:16:44.660 --> 02:16:46.610
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was so many things that like,</v>

3325
02:16:46.630 --> 02:16:50.320
<v Speaker 2>I always thought that a lot of the stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to present in the movie was</v>

3326
02:16:50.321 --> 02:16:52.290
<v Speaker 2>a conspiracy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3327
02:16:52.390 --> 02:16:56.410
<v Speaker 2>like people are gonna think I'm crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you find so much proof that</v>

3328
02:16:56.860 --> 02:17:00.340
<v Speaker 2>like you're being lied to that it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy that the proof keeps mounting.</v>

3329
02:17:00.341 --> 02:17:02.350
<v Speaker 2>And that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was always surprising to me.</v>

3330
02:17:02.351 --> 02:17:03.290
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3331
02:17:03.340 --> 02:17:07.270
<v Speaker 2>every sort of corner I would turn in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie,</v>

3332
02:17:07.510 --> 02:17:08.140
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3333
02:17:08.140 --> 02:17:11.800
<v Speaker 2>this is something else that's messed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then trying to get people to be in a</v>

3334
02:17:11.801 --> 02:17:13.020
<v Speaker 2>movie and talk about their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3335
02:17:13.100 --> 02:17:15.610
<v Speaker 2>their drug use isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that isn't ever easy.</v>

3336
02:17:15.730 --> 02:17:16.750
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's always a problem.</v>

3337
02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:18.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That woman was really,</v>

3338
02:17:18.730 --> 02:17:21.460
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really profound.</v>

3339
02:17:21.580 --> 02:17:23.800
<v Speaker 2>It was really intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things that she said,</v>

3340
02:17:23.801 --> 02:17:25.690
<v Speaker 2>what she was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you worried that they're going to</v>

3341
02:17:25.691 --> 02:17:26.321
<v Speaker 2>kill you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>

3342
02:17:26.321 --> 02:17:28.240
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm worried that they're gonna kill you</v>

3343
02:17:28.241 --> 02:17:31.000
<v Speaker 2>and you and you and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to be screaming from the</v>

3344
02:17:31.001 --> 02:17:33.000
<v Speaker 2>rooftops and no one's going to care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3345
02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:34.570
<v Speaker 2>That sounds crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But It,</v>

3346
02:17:34.571 --> 02:17:37.270
<v Speaker 2>the whole time people were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't you afraid they're going to kill</v>

3347
02:17:37.271 --> 02:17:38.104
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

3348
02:17:38.140 --> 02:17:40.390
<v Speaker 2>if they kill me because I made a movie</v>
<v Speaker 2>about prescription drugs,</v>

3349
02:17:40.630 --> 02:17:42.190
<v Speaker 2>that just proves the point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3350
02:17:42.191 --> 02:17:43.240
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not afraid.</v>

3351
02:17:43.420 --> 02:17:46.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna live my life and I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to live my life in fear because of</v>

3352
02:17:46.740 --> 02:17:49.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make something and tell the</v>
<v Speaker 2>truth and somebody's going to kill me.</v>

3353
02:17:49.481 --> 02:17:50.860
<v Speaker 2>That'd be like the worst way to live</v>
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>

3354
02:17:50.980 --> 02:17:52.900
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like they have a team of</v>

3355
02:17:52.901 --> 02:17:55.010
<v Speaker 2>assassins working for a pharmaceutical</v>
<v Speaker 2>company.</v>

3356
02:17:55.430 --> 02:17:57.580
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to kill you because</v>

3357
02:17:57.581 --> 02:17:59.600
<v Speaker 2>there's going to keep making billions of</v>
<v Speaker 2>data.</v>

3358
02:17:59.630 --> 02:18:02.860
<v Speaker 2>We don't care like your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your documentary is profound as it is.</v>

3359
02:18:02.861 --> 02:18:05.950
<v Speaker 2>It's only going to put a dent and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>one percent of the people that would be</v>

3360
02:18:05.951 --> 02:18:07.930
<v Speaker 2>thinking about taking those drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3361
02:18:08.130 --> 02:18:09.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem.</v>

3362
02:18:09.071 --> 02:18:10.900
<v Speaker 2>YeaH.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well we can hope is that one percent</v>

3363
02:18:10.901 --> 02:18:15.901
<v Speaker 2>will be 10 percent in a few years and 20</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent in a decade or more and maybe</v>

3364
02:18:16.030 --> 02:18:18.620
<v Speaker 2>other people continue to make these</v>
<v Speaker 2>documentaries and I've covered,</v>

<v Speaker 2>They're going to keep their basically</v>

3377
02:18:40.751 --> 02:18:42.400
<v Speaker 2>And then one day he tells me about his</v>

<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

3380
02:18:46.511 --> 02:18:48.190
<v Speaker 2>And when people are driving their cars</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

3384
02:18:51.580 --> 02:18:53.440
<v Speaker 2>when people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you do a movie like this,</v>

3385
02:18:53.441 --> 02:18:58.210
<v Speaker 2>it becomes a confessional and you will</v>
<v Speaker 2>be shocked at the people who were doing</v>

3386
02:18:58.600 --> 02:19:02.930
<v Speaker 2>the same exact thing as I was doing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>like would look down on me for.</v>

3387
02:19:03.040 --> 02:19:04.390
<v Speaker 2>BecauSe it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well you were a drug addict.</v>

3388

<v Speaker 2>Something that was prescribed by a</v>

3392
02:19:12.251 --> 02:19:13.930
<v Speaker 2>doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you don't feel like a drug addict</v>

3393
02:19:15.670 --> 02:19:16.501
<v Speaker 2>on the streets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3394
02:19:16.501 --> 02:19:19.060
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a lady who thinks she looks down</v>

3395
02:19:19.061 --> 02:19:21.340
<v Speaker 2>on marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in a big way and she just talks</v>

3396
02:19:21.341 --> 02:19:24.280
<v Speaker 2>trash about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she takes a xanax every night when I</v>

3397
02:19:24.500 --> 02:19:27.100
<v Speaker 2>can't go to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I started the movie,</v>

3398
02:19:27.170 --> 02:19:27.980
<v Speaker 2>I was exact same</v>

3399
02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:30.260
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always thought we always thought,</v>

3400
02:19:30.430 --> 02:19:31.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our high school,</v>

3401
02:19:31.880 --> 02:19:34.550
<v Speaker 1>marijuana was for all the dirt bags.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I felt.</v>

3402
02:19:34.551 --> 02:19:37.400
<v Speaker 1>I thought that for so long and now I</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at him like,</v>

3403
02:19:37.401 --> 02:19:40.730
<v Speaker 1>did I miss the boat on that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe what was I doing,</v>

3404
02:19:41.090 --> 02:19:44.030
<v Speaker 1>drinking and taking all these pills when</v>
<v Speaker 1>something was there,</v>

3405
02:19:44.120 --> 02:19:46.220
<v Speaker 1>you didn't want to be a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we're,</v>

3406
02:19:46.370 --> 02:19:48.140
<v Speaker 1>it was drilled into our head when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were kids.</v>

3407
02:19:48.530 --> 02:19:50.570
<v Speaker 1>People who smoke pot or losers and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

3408
02:19:50.571 --> 02:19:51.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think marijuana,</v>

3409
02:19:52.070 --> 02:19:56.150
<v Speaker 1>there's a slippery slope with marijuana</v>
<v Speaker 1>because now that it's become more</v>

3410
02:19:56.151 --> 02:19:57.500
<v Speaker 1>accepted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>medical marijuana,</v>

3411
02:19:57.501 --> 02:20:00.740
<v Speaker 1>in some states it's legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now they're just ramping it up and make</v>

3412
02:20:00.741 --> 02:20:02.440
<v Speaker 1>it stronger and stronger and stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3413
02:20:02.510 --> 02:20:05.330
<v Speaker 1>anything that alters your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your consciousness can be problematic.</v>

3414
02:20:05.360 --> 02:20:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be beneficial or it can be</v>

3415
02:20:07.191 --> 02:20:08.030
<v Speaker 1>problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3416
02:20:08.150 --> 02:20:11.180
<v Speaker 1>The only good thing about marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have a physical addictive</v>

3417
02:20:11.181 --> 02:20:13.580
<v Speaker 1>property to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will your body desires it in a way where</v>

3418
02:20:13.581 --> 02:20:16.400
<v Speaker 1>you're going to start sucking dicks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>robin people for it,</v>

3419
02:20:16.790 --> 02:20:19.400
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly become problem.</v>

3420
02:20:23.090 --> 02:20:26.750
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't that in like half baked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half baked.</v>

3421
02:20:27.740 --> 02:20:31.880
<v Speaker 1>I think that anything can be addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gambling can be addictive,</v>

3422
02:20:31.910 --> 02:20:32.743
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>

3423
02:20:32.960 --> 02:20:34.080
<v Speaker 1>porn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3424
02:20:34.090 --> 02:20:37.520
<v Speaker 1>when people get obsessed with things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's addiction in a way,</v>

3425
02:20:37.570 --> 02:20:39.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get obsessed with all kinds of</v>

3426
02:20:39.860 --> 02:20:42.560
<v Speaker 1>healthy or unhealthy things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

3427
02:20:42.660 --> 02:20:44.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that what,</v>

3428
02:20:44.440 --> 02:20:49.440
<v Speaker 1>what we're seeing with this documentary</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a world that has been growing.</v>

3429
02:20:51.160 --> 02:20:52.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

3430
02:20:52.191 --> 02:20:57.191
<v Speaker 1>it's an epidemic that's been growing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're just not getting that much</v>

3431
02:20:57.471 --> 02:21:02.180
<v Speaker 1>exposure to in the mainstream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not hearing these numbers.</v>

3432
02:21:02.181 --> 02:21:04.940
<v Speaker 1>We're not hearing these statistics that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you presented in this movie.</v>

3433
02:21:05.380 --> 02:21:10.160
<v Speaker 1>The statistics about the $250 million</v>
<v Speaker 1>prescriptions a year.</v>

3434
02:21:10.810 --> 02:21:13.370
<v Speaker 1>Just that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's sad is like they put people</v>

3435
02:21:13.371 --> 02:21:16.700
<v Speaker 1>on this endless cycle all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like chris liebing Who's in the movie</v>

3436
02:21:16.701 --> 02:21:17.600
<v Speaker 1>ufc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3437
02:21:17.870 --> 02:21:18.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

3438
02:21:18.980 --> 02:21:20.750
<v Speaker 1>he was awesome to talk to is great.</v>

3439
02:21:20.750 --> 02:21:22.610
<v Speaker 1>And then I talked to him like not that</v>
<v Speaker 1>long ago,</v>

3440
02:21:22.611 --> 02:21:25.400
<v Speaker 1>you've gotten in some trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I called them and to see how he's</v>

3441
02:21:25.401 --> 02:21:27.960
<v Speaker 1>doing and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sucks because he's still on suboxone</v>

3442
02:21:27.961 --> 02:21:28.791
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eh,</v>

3443
02:21:28.791 --> 02:21:31.040
<v Speaker 1>you don't like that's a drug that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3444
02:21:31.430 --> 02:21:34.070
<v Speaker 1>he's on it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said he told him he was still on it</v>

3445
02:21:34.100 --> 02:21:35.990
<v Speaker 1>and he's still drinking once in a while</v>
<v Speaker 1>until it's taking that.</v>

3446
02:21:36.230 --> 02:21:38.510
<v Speaker 1>And it sucks because he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a cool guy,</v>

3447
02:21:38.511 --> 02:21:39.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a great guy,</v>

3448
02:21:39.500 --> 02:21:41.390
<v Speaker 1>a little reckless here and there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was,</v>

3449
02:21:41.750 --> 02:21:44.960
<v Speaker 1>he was so awesome to talk to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You actually became a friend through</v>

3450
02:21:44.961 --> 02:21:47.480
<v Speaker 1>doing the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I always worry about my friends,</v>

3451
02:21:47.481 --> 02:21:50.060
<v Speaker 1>like I don't want them to still be on</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff or still be taking stuff,</v>

3452
02:21:50.061 --> 02:21:51.420
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3453
02:21:51.680 --> 02:21:55.160
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to add that the reason why he</v>
<v Speaker 1>relapsed was because he tried to stop</v>

3454
02:21:55.161 --> 02:21:58.760
<v Speaker 1>everything cold Turkey on his own and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped for seven days.</v>

3455
02:21:58.760 --> 02:22:00.920
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that's when he,</v>

3456
02:22:01.010 --> 02:22:03.470
<v Speaker 1>that's when he relapsed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those people out there that think</v>

3457
02:22:03.471 --> 02:22:05.840
<v Speaker 1>they can do it by themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he probably can't.</v>

3458
02:22:05.870 --> 02:22:07.340
<v Speaker 1>You probably need to try to seek some</v>
<v Speaker 1>help.</v>

3459
02:22:07.640 --> 02:22:10.370
<v Speaker 1>It was a lot of people that are very</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong willed and they feel like I can</v>

3460
02:22:10.371 --> 02:22:13.190
<v Speaker 1>do it like some other pussies camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to be able to do it and</v>

3461
02:22:13.210 --> 02:22:15.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went through 90 days of rehab and I</v>

3462
02:22:15.951 --> 02:22:19.550
<v Speaker 1>came out and I've been sober for like 22</v>
<v Speaker 1>months and people in,</v>

3463
02:22:20.240 --> 02:22:22.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my circle say that's a miracle</v>

3464
02:22:22.851 --> 02:22:24.920
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of people don't even make</v>
<v Speaker 1>it that far,</v>

3465
02:22:24.930 --> 02:22:28.500
<v Speaker 1>so I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to keep going and trying</v>

3466
02:22:28.501 --> 02:22:31.140
<v Speaker 1>to get healthier because I think it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>all a snowball effect.</v>

3467
02:22:31.141 --> 02:22:35.310
<v Speaker 1>You can go snowball effect downhill or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go snowball effect and you know,</v>

3468
02:22:35.311 --> 02:22:38.670
<v Speaker 1>beyond the rise and started doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything right and eating like you're</v>

3469
02:22:38.671 --> 02:22:41.610
<v Speaker 1>eating and using people like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're a big inspiration to me.</v>

3470
02:22:41.610 --> 02:22:43.740
<v Speaker 1>I listen to the show all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's awesome.</v>

3471
02:22:43.950 --> 02:22:47.550
<v Speaker 1>It's a great source of information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a bunch of different things I do</v>

3472
02:22:47.551 --> 02:22:51.540
<v Speaker 1>every day and listen to and watch and</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to gain information from everybody,</v>

3473
02:22:51.570 --> 02:22:52.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>become a better personal.</v>

3474
02:22:52.760 --> 02:22:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate it and I do too.</v>

3475
02:22:54.631 --> 02:22:58.830
<v Speaker 1>I have a bunch of different podcasts</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I listen to and new sources that I</v>

3476
02:22:58.860 --> 02:23:00.870
<v Speaker 1>find and I think this is a cool time for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3477
02:23:00.900 --> 02:23:03.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a cool time for like a guy like</v>

3478
02:23:03.931 --> 02:23:07.380
<v Speaker 1>you can come on a podcast and just talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a few hours and explain everything</v>

3479
02:23:07.381 --> 02:23:11.430
<v Speaker 1>and be open and people hear this more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than a million people will hear this and</v>

3480
02:23:11.520 --> 02:23:13.830
<v Speaker 1>it'll open their eyes to what this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>all about.</v>

3481
02:23:13.860 --> 02:23:17.040
<v Speaker 1>I felt obligated to be open because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>felt like I did so much bad shit.</v>

3482
02:23:17.040 --> 02:23:18.210
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like man,</v>

3483
02:23:18.211 --> 02:23:22.080
<v Speaker 1>I got to tell people about this and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people are afraid to be an open</v>

3484
02:23:22.081 --> 02:23:25.680
<v Speaker 1>book and I understand that the luxury I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have is I'm a nobody.</v>

3485
02:23:25.681 --> 02:23:26.620
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3486
02:23:26.730 --> 02:23:28.440
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have nothing to lose.</v>

3487
02:23:28.920 --> 02:23:30.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not a nobody.</v>

3488
02:23:30.421 --> 02:23:32.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're a well known documentary</v>
<v Speaker 1>film maker,</v>

3489
02:23:32.641 --> 02:23:36.090
<v Speaker 1>but I think that it takes balls no</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter who you are to do what you did.</v>

3490
02:23:36.091 --> 02:23:38.280
<v Speaker 1>So thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for the documentary.</v>

3491
02:23:38.610 --> 02:23:41.040
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for making two awesome</v>
<v Speaker 1>documentaries that I've seen.</v>

3492
02:23:41.070 --> 02:23:45.600
<v Speaker 1>I still haven't seen trophy trophy kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I have kids.</v>

3493
02:23:45.610 --> 02:23:47.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing too is it's not over,</v>

3494
02:23:47.670 --> 02:23:48.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's still,</v>

3495
02:23:48.391 --> 02:23:52.130
<v Speaker 1>he's still working on his life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still working on rebuilding and you</v>

3496
02:23:52.131 --> 02:23:53.940
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a financial disaster.</v>

3497
02:23:54.220 --> 02:23:55.830
<v Speaker 1>We decided as a family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've had,</v>

3498
02:23:55.860 --> 02:23:58.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>family meetings to figure out how the</v>

3499
02:23:58.171 --> 02:23:59.430
<v Speaker 1>fuck do we help him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3500
02:23:59.431 --> 02:24:04.050
<v Speaker 1>so we all got together and now they</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually moved him out of this pit of la</v>

3501
02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:06.240
<v Speaker 1>and moved him to sacramento.</v>

3502
02:24:06.240 --> 02:24:09.510
<v Speaker 1>He lives in sacramento now and davis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lives down the street from me and he</v>

3503
02:24:09.511 --> 02:24:11.820
<v Speaker 1>works for me now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're just producing content for my</v>

3504
02:24:11.821 --> 02:24:14.700
<v Speaker 1>youtube channel and just cranking out</v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome information.</v>

3505
02:24:14.701 --> 02:24:17.100
<v Speaker 1>We'll probably do some documentary style</v>
<v Speaker 1>things as well.</v>

3506
02:24:17.520 --> 02:24:21.060
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because I inspired him to</v>
<v Speaker 1>start working out when he was 12 years</v>

3507
02:24:21.061 --> 02:24:23.790
<v Speaker 1>old and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now he inspires me.</v>

3508
02:24:23.791 --> 02:24:25.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a dyslexic kid.</v>

3509
02:24:25.470 --> 02:24:26.303
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3510
02:24:26.430 --> 02:24:28.170
<v Speaker 1>his car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's worth millions of dollars now.</v>

3511
02:24:28.171 --> 02:24:31.440
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy because he was always told he</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't do it.</v>

3512
02:24:31.660 --> 02:24:34.770
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't smart enough and you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna make it and all that bullshit,</v>

3513
02:24:34.771 --> 02:24:37.500
<v Speaker 1>right that they tell you in school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put you in a class with the kids</v>

3514
02:24:37.501 --> 02:24:40.580
<v Speaker 1>that are eating glue and he invented</v>
<v Speaker 1>sundance gunfire.</v>

3515
02:24:40.710 --> 02:24:41.780
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3516
02:24:41.790 --> 02:24:43.510
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like a meat head version of,</v>

<v Speaker 1>message for people to follow what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're passionate about.</v>

<v Speaker 1>what he loved to do that don't give up</v>
<v Speaker 1>on shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>love.</v>
