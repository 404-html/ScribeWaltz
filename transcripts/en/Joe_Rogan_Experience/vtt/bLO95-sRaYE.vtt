1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.680
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.770
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be a rough transition,</v>

3
00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:09.771
<v Speaker 1>but seeings how I have to go do my podcast pretty quick on the topic of</v>

4
00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:10.950
<v Speaker 1>podcasts.</v>

5
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:11.341
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6
00:00:11.341 --> 00:00:12.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm being sued.</v>

7
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.283
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

8
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.480
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

9
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.520
<v Speaker 1>explain that to people because it's one of the dumbest fucking lawsuits I've</v>

10
00:00:17.521 --> 00:00:18.360
<v Speaker 1>ever heard in my life.</v>

11
00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:22.410
<v Speaker 1>But there's people that make a living off of these types of lawsuits right</v>

12
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.740
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

13
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.660
<v Speaker 1>Called Patent trolls.</v>

15
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.340
<v Speaker 1>They buy up patents and their lawyers and it Sorta,</v>

16
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.440
<v Speaker 1>I think it's this country at its worst.</v>

17
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.460
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

18
00:00:32.461 --> 00:00:37.461
<v Speaker 1>It's they buy patents and then they shoe companies saying they're using stealing</v>

19
00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:40.950
<v Speaker 1>or unlawfully using their technology.</v>

20
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.590
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes when you're buying technology,</v>

21
00:00:43.591 --> 00:00:45.120
<v Speaker 1>there's a real good argument to that.</v>

22
00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:49.020
<v Speaker 1>Like that technology is a part of this thing that you're selling.</v>

23
00:00:49.021 --> 00:00:50.280
<v Speaker 1>And without that technology,</v>

24
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:51.360
<v Speaker 1>which is patented,</v>

25
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.810
<v Speaker 1>your technology while you're selling would not exist.</v>

26
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

27
00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.440
<v Speaker 1>And I get that part and I support innovation and people should be paid for for</v>

28
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.460
<v Speaker 1>intellectual property and creative ideas.</v>

29
00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:04.140
<v Speaker 1>But this is a weird one.</v>

30
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.170
<v Speaker 1>This is what is the exact term that,</v>

31
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.200
<v Speaker 1>that they have a patent on the exact cause they have a patent on a playlist.</v>

32
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.520
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

33
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.680
<v Speaker 1>So on anything in a serial order,</v>

34
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:16.951
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

35
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:17.550
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

36
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Like even blogs I evidently anything that's comes out on a Monday and then the</v>

37
00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:29.160
<v Speaker 1>next one comes out on a Tuesday or this song is above that song and the song's</v>

38
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:30.840
<v Speaker 1>number three and that song's number seven.</v>

39
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.070
<v Speaker 1>That's what they claim to have dominion over.</v>

40
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.860
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a blog and you enter into the blog,</v>

41
00:01:37.861 --> 00:01:40.110
<v Speaker 1>like a blog entry number one,</v>

42
00:01:40.111 --> 00:01:43.650
<v Speaker 1>you know a Adam goes to do podcasts to talk about this lawsuit,</v>

43
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.660
<v Speaker 1>they could sue you for that.</v>

44
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.310
<v Speaker 1>Like they own a piece of that,</v>

45
00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:50.490
<v Speaker 1>a serialized message that you're putting on a website.</v>

46
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

47
00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:53.340
<v Speaker 1>Numbered message that that's correct.</v>

48
00:01:53.341 --> 00:01:54.210
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

49
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.630
<v Speaker 1>Well this insane because if it's true then really everything on the Internet's</v>

50
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.200
<v Speaker 1>got to go away.</v>

51
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.711
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>

52
00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if they bought up everything on the Internet with one sneaky</v>

53
00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:06.024
<v Speaker 1>move?</v>

54
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Like one sneaky move,</v>

55
00:02:07.411 --> 00:02:08.700
<v Speaker 1>one patent with the judge says,</v>

56
00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:08.881
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

57
00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:09.631
<v Speaker 1>the guy's got a point.</v>

58
00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:11.820
<v Speaker 1>He owns everything in serialized form.</v>

59
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.773
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

60
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.650
<v Speaker 1>the problem is is I don't think the judge or the jury is going to think they</v>

61
00:02:16.651 --> 00:02:17.484
<v Speaker 1>have a point.</v>

62
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.110
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

63
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.590
<v Speaker 1>in order to make our point that they don't have a point,</v>

64
00:02:22.591 --> 00:02:24.990
<v Speaker 1>it's going to cost one point $5 million.</v>

65
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.730
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

66
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.730
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

67
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.330
<v Speaker 1>That's what patent litigation costs.</v>

68
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.950
<v Speaker 1>That's what the legal fees are going to be.</v>

69
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.790
<v Speaker 1>That's what,</v>

70
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.590
<v Speaker 1>that's what I've been quoted.</v>

71
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

72
00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:43.791
<v Speaker 1>I've been quoted 1.25 to 1.5 wow.</v>

73
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

74
00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:45.901
<v Speaker 1>That's stunning.</v>

75
00:02:45.901 --> 00:02:47.370
<v Speaker 1>I never would have thought it would be that high.</v>

76
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.620
<v Speaker 1>So are they always spring hate a lot,</v>

77
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:50.150
<v Speaker 1>so it was,</v>

78
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.851
<v Speaker 1>is that what it is?</v>

79
00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:51.780
<v Speaker 1>It's all the lawyers.</v>

80
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.100
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

81
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.640
<v Speaker 1>It's all the lawyers and that.</v>

82
00:02:55.641 --> 00:02:57.240
<v Speaker 1>How much work did they have to do here,</v>

83
00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.273
<v Speaker 1>Joe?</v>

84
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.440
<v Speaker 1>For me it's like first off,</v>

85
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.340
<v Speaker 1>I spent $50,000 trying to get a change of fucking venue.</v>

86
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.620
<v Speaker 1>These guys are in eastern Texas.</v>

87
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.150
<v Speaker 1>That's where they set up because eastern Texas is famous for him.</v>

88
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.930
<v Speaker 1>Leave to their types of folk.</v>

89
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

90
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:18.820
<v Speaker 1>If to this type of thing.</v>

91
00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Patent troll lawsuits.</v>

92
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't live in eastern Texas and my businesses in eastern Texas and they don't</v>

93
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 1>live in eastern Texas either.</v>

94
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:31.240
<v Speaker 1>That's just where they've hung their shingle and they hung their shingle</v>

95
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:35.230
<v Speaker 1>specifically because this is a place it's advantageous to do things like this</v>

96
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.590
<v Speaker 1>well is it's what you would do if you were company that bought up other people's</v>

97
00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:46.411
<v Speaker 1>technology and then tried to sue other businesses and make money off of them.</v>

98
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.150
<v Speaker 1>You're going to maximize that.</v>

99
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.040
<v Speaker 1>The possibility of you getting an outcome that's in your favor and you'll do it</v>

100
00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:55.450
<v Speaker 1>on the moon if you have to.</v>

101
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.721
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

102
00:03:55.721 --> 00:03:58.240
<v Speaker 1>if these people come to you with some sort of a settlement,</v>

103
00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:59.381
<v Speaker 1>like if they said,</v>

104
00:03:59.381 --> 00:03:59.771
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

105
00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:00.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

106
00:04:00.011 --> 00:04:01.300
<v Speaker 1>you're using our technology,</v>

107
00:04:01.301 --> 00:04:02.680
<v Speaker 1>we would like five bucks a month.</v>

108
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.150
<v Speaker 1>Like anything along those lines.</v>

109
00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:04.810
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

110
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:05.920
<v Speaker 1>$3 million.</v>

111
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

112
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.480
<v Speaker 1>And this because they've,</v>

113
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.580
<v Speaker 1>they've won these before the same company.</v>

114
00:04:12.581 --> 00:04:14.320
<v Speaker 1>They got $8 million from apple,</v>

115
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

116
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:15.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

117
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.551
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

118
00:04:15.551 --> 00:04:20.551
<v Speaker 1>it's unclear what I'm doing with them and what they're doing with me,</v>

119
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.830
<v Speaker 1>but it's a pretty simple equation,</v>

120
00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:25.570
<v Speaker 1>which is I just said,</v>

121
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:25.871
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

122
00:04:25.871 --> 00:04:30.871
<v Speaker 1>all the guys in podcasting need to kind of band together and we need to fight</v>

123
00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:33.700
<v Speaker 1>them and then we need to beat them.</v>

124
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.260
<v Speaker 1>And then once we beat them,</v>

125
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.543
<v Speaker 1>then their beat,</v>

126
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.030
<v Speaker 1>because they can't go after you or mark Marin or whoever once we beat them.</v>

127
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.210
<v Speaker 1>But if we allow this to just go away,</v>

128
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.620
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to,</v>

129
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.191
<v Speaker 1>if we say,</v>

130
00:04:48.191 --> 00:04:48.371
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

131
00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:49.990
<v Speaker 1>let's just put it aside and you know,</v>

132
00:04:49.991 --> 00:04:50.950
<v Speaker 1>fucking ignore them,</v>

133
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.963
<v Speaker 1>then they win.</v>

134
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

135
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.040
<v Speaker 1>it's a possibility that they could win.</v>

136
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.300
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>

137
00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:56.111
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

138
00:04:56.111 --> 00:04:57.130
<v Speaker 1>when you get sued,</v>

139
00:04:57.131 --> 00:04:57.920
<v Speaker 1>you get sued.</v>

140
00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.020
<v Speaker 1>He got to respond.</v>

141
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.550
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

142
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:01.870
<v Speaker 1>let's just say,</v>

143
00:05:01.871 --> 00:05:02.400
<v Speaker 1>we said,</v>

144
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.233
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

145
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.240
<v Speaker 1>you guys obviously haven't done the math on our company,</v>

146
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.920
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

147
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:10.120
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

148
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.170
<v Speaker 1>it's a business.</v>

149
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.320
<v Speaker 1>No one wants to spend the time and the 1 million plus dollars to fight this</v>

150
00:05:17.141 --> 00:05:17.740
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

151
00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:18.573
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

152
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:23.790
<v Speaker 1>take 350 grand and please go away or 500 grand or a hundred grand,</v>

153
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.850
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

154
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.980
<v Speaker 1>Well how long before they go to iTunes and they go,</v>

155
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.300
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

156
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.150
<v Speaker 1>let's see who else is doing okay over here on iTunes and they take a piece of</v>

157
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.280
<v Speaker 1>steel in all right.</v>

158
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.791
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

159
00:05:39.791 --> 00:05:41.770
<v Speaker 1>last time we did this with Corolla,</v>

160
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.220
<v Speaker 1>we got 500 k out of him when we chose good for and all we got to do is do the</v>

161
00:05:48.221 --> 00:05:49.750
<v Speaker 1>same thing we did with Corolla.</v>

162
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.853
<v Speaker 1>He knows,</v>

163
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean we'll let,</v>

164
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.730
<v Speaker 1>we'll let Joe's attorneys coach 'em up,</v>

165
00:05:54.731 --> 00:05:55.870
<v Speaker 1>but they're going to tell you this,</v>

166
00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.020
<v Speaker 1>the most expensive kind of litigation is going to cost over a million dollars.</v>

167
00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:00.171
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

168
00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:01.690
<v Speaker 1>he can go on the Internet and looked at them.</v>

169
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.840
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that these human beings are behind this?</v>

170
00:06:03.841 --> 00:06:05.160
<v Speaker 2>Do you know the actual human beings?</v>

171
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.113
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

172
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.860
<v Speaker 2>are you aware of names or faces?</v>

173
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:08.703
<v Speaker 2>You know what they look like?</v>

174
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.651
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

175
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:10.191
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

176
00:06:10.191 --> 00:06:12.470
<v Speaker 1>And I never think that way.</v>

177
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.240
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

178
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.240
<v Speaker 1>I just think that I understand that we live in a world that is generally decent</v>

179
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.720
<v Speaker 1>and that these people probably think of themselves as generally decent.</v>

180
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.471
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

181
00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:30.050
<v Speaker 1>they probably have kids that love them and a wife that,</v>

182
00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:30.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

183
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.660
<v Speaker 1>it gives him a blowjob on occasion.</v>

184
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Speaker 1>This is what they do for living.</v>

185
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:36.920
<v Speaker 1>This is their business.</v>

186
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.400
<v Speaker 1>And I think when a guy works at a used RV lot and he's got an Rv on that lot</v>

187
00:06:44.301 --> 00:06:48.530
<v Speaker 1>that's worth $4,000 and some elderly couple comes in there and he gets them for</v>

188
00:06:48.531 --> 00:06:49.364
<v Speaker 1>20 grand,</v>

189
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.620
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't go home and stare in the mirror and go,</v>

190
00:06:51.621 --> 00:06:52.280
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

191
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm a really bad human being.</v>

192
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.560
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

193
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fucking great salesman.</v>

194
00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.320
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's what these guys do.</v>

195
00:07:00.321 --> 00:07:02.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't even fault them.</v>

196
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.970
<v Speaker 1>And on a personal level,</v>

197
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.200
<v Speaker 1>like they make money from doing this,</v>

198
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.000
<v Speaker 1>I understand it.</v>

199
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:11.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

200
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:12.681
<v Speaker 1>it's no,</v>

201
00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:17.030
<v Speaker 1>it's not even worth trying to make it a personal issue.</v>

202
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel it's a personal issue.</v>

203
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.560
<v Speaker 1>They saw my podcast,</v>

204
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually in a bizarre way,</v>

205
00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:24.944
<v Speaker 1>flattered.</v>

206
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.780
<v Speaker 1>They saw my podcast and said,</v>

207
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.910
<v Speaker 1>that guy's really doing well for himself.</v>

208
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.220
<v Speaker 1>I kids go get one to 3 million bucks.</v>

209
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:31.580
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

210
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:32.413
<v Speaker 1>that's insane.</v>

211
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.580
<v Speaker 1>That was their first offering.</v>

212
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.110
<v Speaker 1>So it's stunning.</v>

213
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:40.640
<v Speaker 1>What we're doing is we're getting everyone together and we're going to show him</v>

214
00:07:40.641 --> 00:07:44.360
<v Speaker 1>that the podcast community is a lot stronger than they thought,</v>

215
00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.490
<v Speaker 1>that they fucked with the wrong people.</v>

216
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:47.960
<v Speaker 1>And I don't mean me,</v>

217
00:07:47.961 --> 00:07:52.961
<v Speaker 1>I mean everybody and that whether you're a Joe Rogan fan or Adam Carolla fan or</v>

218
00:07:53.061 --> 00:07:54.200
<v Speaker 1>an NPR fan,</v>

219
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:59.120
<v Speaker 1>it's all going away if we don't buck up and beat these guys.</v>

220
00:07:59.121 --> 00:08:02.230
<v Speaker 1>So we just went to fund anything D.</v>

221
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:07.570
<v Speaker 1>Dot com forward slash pan trawl and you can give toward the legal defense fund.</v>

222
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.880
<v Speaker 2>This is a video up there to watch where Adam explains the whole situation and</v>

223
00:08:13.881 --> 00:08:14.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

224
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:15.450
<v Speaker 2>what's going on and,</v>

225
00:08:15.451 --> 00:08:16.221
<v Speaker 2>and spread this,</v>

226
00:08:16.221 --> 00:08:17.240
<v Speaker 2>spread it on Twitter,</v>

227
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:18.890
<v Speaker 2>spread it on Facebook.</v>

228
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.700
<v Speaker 2>Let everybody know if you can't donate it,</v>

229
00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:26.660
<v Speaker 2>at least spread the word and let people know what the fuck is going on because</v>

230
00:08:26.661 --> 00:08:27.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

231
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.441
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

232
00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:28.670
<v Speaker 2>this is a crazy thing.</v>

233
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.510
<v Speaker 2>It's just a weird byproduct of our society,</v>

234
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:33.523
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

235
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:34.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it,</v>

236
00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.220
<v Speaker 2>but there's nothing we could do about it at this point in time.</v>

237
00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:38.091
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

238
00:08:38.091 --> 00:08:38.924
<v Speaker 2>Other than that,</v>

239
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:40.663
<v Speaker 2>this</v>

240
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:45.590
<v Speaker 1>is really cool because this could be a seminal moment for podcasting,</v>

241
00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:47.720
<v Speaker 1>which you guys fucked with the wrong guys.</v>

242
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:49.100
<v Speaker 1>We're all grassroots,</v>

243
00:08:49.101 --> 00:08:50.450
<v Speaker 1>but we all band together.</v>

244
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:55.720
<v Speaker 1>We all got our little individual little armies and we all got them United and we</v>

245
00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:57.890
<v Speaker 1>all fought this common cause.</v>

246
00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.050
<v Speaker 2>You know what I love about podcasting?</v>

247
00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:04.070
<v Speaker 2>That I do think that that's something that fits with the ethic of podcasting.</v>

248
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.590
<v Speaker 2>But I also love that podcasting isn't,</v>

249
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:07.160
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

250
00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.600
<v Speaker 2>it's not a competitive thing in that everybody supports everybody else in</v>

251
00:09:11.601 --> 00:09:12.434
<v Speaker 2>podcasting.</v>

252
00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:17.150
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard of podcast feuds like morning Dj guys always fucking hate the</v>

253
00:09:17.151 --> 00:09:18.320
<v Speaker 2>other morning Dj Guy,</v>

254
00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:18.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

255
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:19.820
<v Speaker 2>And they always talk shit about him.</v>

256
00:09:19.821 --> 00:09:21.170
<v Speaker 2>But podcasts,</v>

257
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:21.480
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

258
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:21.710
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

259
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anybody who says like,</v>

260
00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:24.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

261
00:09:24.951 --> 00:09:25.131
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

262
00:09:25.131 --> 00:09:28.220
<v Speaker 2>we would be fucking doing great if it wasn't for that Adam Carolla show.</v>

263
00:09:28.221 --> 00:09:32.870
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's watching that stupid shows sucks our podcasts is the future that</v>

264
00:09:32.871 --> 00:09:34.670
<v Speaker 2>shows for old people fuck out.</v>

265
00:09:34.671 --> 00:09:35.150
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

266
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:35.720
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't,</v>

267
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.340
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem to be going on at all.</v>

268
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:38.510
<v Speaker 2>I think the Internet,</v>

269
00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:42.350
<v Speaker 2>the attitude of the Internet is that what you're dealing with the world,</v>

270
00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.180
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with an infinite amount of people.</v>

271
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:49.190
<v Speaker 2>It's so God damn big that having that sort of famine mentality that a lot of</v>

272
00:09:49.581 --> 00:09:53.210
<v Speaker 2>people have if they are in morning radio in a specific city,</v>

273
00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.410
<v Speaker 2>you don't need it in,</v>

274
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:55.250
<v Speaker 2>in the Internet.</v>

275
00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:55.491
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

276
00:09:55.491 --> 00:09:56.840
<v Speaker 1>I listen every,</v>

277
00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:58.160
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>

278
00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:59.083
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

279
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.530
<v Speaker 1>you know the last podcast I did yesterday,</v>

280
00:10:03.531 --> 00:10:08.531
<v Speaker 1>Jay Mohr and Jo Koy were both guests on the show and they both have podcasts and</v>

281
00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:15.760
<v Speaker 1>80% of the guests on my show have their own podcasts and we promote their</v>

282
00:10:17.091 --> 00:10:18.770
<v Speaker 1>podcasts on my podcast.</v>

283
00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.191
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

284
00:10:19.191 --> 00:10:20.910
<v Speaker 1>So that's all you need to know,</v>

285
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:21.390
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

286
00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:23.970
<v Speaker 2>We do the exact same thing and I'm always telling people,</v>

287
00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.290
