<v Speaker 1>Yamato Democracy that you have always,</v>

<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

91
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:41.920
<v Speaker 1>this Samurai spirit and this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this spirit of Japan,</v>

93
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.960
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've talked openly that you freely</v>

94
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.540
<v Speaker 1>give yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you would go to fight and you</v>

95
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:53.470
<v Speaker 1>would be ready to die.</v>

98
00:03:59.251 --> 00:04:00.930
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

99
00:04:00.931 --> 00:04:02.650
<v Speaker 1>say goodbye to your family versus a fire</v>

100
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.020
<v Speaker 3>letters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wrote letters to people that I wanted</v>

101
00:04:06.021 --> 00:04:09.530
<v Speaker 3>to say goodbye to every fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

103
00:04:11.281 --> 00:04:16.281
<v Speaker 3>it was the thing too is I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting to die flying to die.</v>

104
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.450
<v Speaker 3>You're going to train with the will to</v>
<v Speaker 3>die too,</v>

105
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.830
<v Speaker 3>so you can write it down as good</v>
<v Speaker 3>training I got in.</v>

106
00:04:22.831 --> 00:04:27.831
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm training every day before the</v>

107
00:04:28.521 --> 00:04:30.650
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I won't die in the fight.</v>

108
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm planning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm okay.</v>

109
00:04:32.661 --> 00:04:35.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm accepting the fact that I might die</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

110
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.490
<v Speaker 3>but I know that the better I can be is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the less chance to me dying in the rain.</v>

111
00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.841
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and because I'm sore,</v>

113
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to miss training because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm tired or I'm lazy because it'll</v>

114
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.760
<v Speaker 3>might be the difference in me living in</v>
<v Speaker 3>dying in the room.</v>

115
00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:54.300
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

119
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.110
<v Speaker 3>but I'm trying to eat only good things</v>
<v Speaker 3>on my before my flight.</v>

120
00:05:03.111 --> 00:05:05.540
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot easier to do that when you're</v>

121
00:05:05.541 --> 00:05:08.360
<v Speaker 3>in it to that level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can't hurt you,</v>

122
00:05:08.361 --> 00:05:10.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to plan to die in the ring to,</v>

123
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.930
<v Speaker 3>to believe that and to train and to walk</v>
<v Speaker 3>that life for that three months while</v>

124
00:05:14.931 --> 00:05:16.700
<v Speaker 3>training for the fight it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't hurt you.</v>

125
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.620
<v Speaker 1>Is it difficult for you because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>earnestly embraced that thought process?</v>

126
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.120
<v Speaker 1>Is it difficult for you when you see</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys that are kind of dabbling in mma</v>

127
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.510
<v Speaker 1>that Kinda like half asking it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not training hard enough?</v>

128
00:05:31.511 --> 00:05:34.870
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they have some talent but they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really put their will and heart</v>

129
00:05:34.871 --> 00:05:35.530
<v Speaker 1>into it.</v>

130
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:36.820
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a whole new era now.</v>

131
00:05:36.821 --> 00:05:39.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because back in the day we didn't get</v>

132
00:05:39.641 --> 00:05:40.600
<v Speaker 3>paid good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We weren't,</v>

133
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.550
<v Speaker 3>we weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't that worried about,</v>

134
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>losing a sponsor here,</v>

135
00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.600
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Being cut by the UFC,</v>

136
00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:47.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of stuff didn't,</v>

137
00:05:47.711 --> 00:05:51.310
<v Speaker 3>because there was all these little</v>
<v Speaker 3>association with funding for so little</v>

138
00:05:51.311 --> 00:05:53.760
<v Speaker 3>bit money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The objective and the,</v>

139
00:05:53.761 --> 00:05:56.260
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole movement of that error was</v>

140
00:05:56.261 --> 00:05:56.891
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

141
00:05:56.891 --> 00:05:57.724
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

142
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.650
<v Speaker 3>when fighters start getting lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

143
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:01.480
<v Speaker 4>Eh,</v>

144
00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.810
<v Speaker 3>or they don't fight as hard or the tap</v>
<v Speaker 3>out a little sooner.</v>

145
00:06:04.811 --> 00:06:06.460
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand that because there's a</v>

146
00:06:06.461 --> 00:06:09.010
<v Speaker 3>whole new era because you're fighting</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a different reason though.</v>

147
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.740
<v Speaker 3>They're fighting for money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are fighting for living.</v>

148
00:06:11.741 --> 00:06:13.660
<v Speaker 3>They're fighting for sponsors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we need to look good,</v>

149
00:06:13.661 --> 00:06:16.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's easier when you're fighting for</v>

150
00:06:16.571 --> 00:06:17.404
<v Speaker 3>those reasons.</v>

151
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.750
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

152
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's only so much money will make you</v>

153
00:06:20.851 --> 00:06:21.760
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

154
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.140
<v Speaker 3>But if you're fighting for your honor</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're fighting for your life,</v>

155
00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.670
<v Speaker 3>it's a whole different level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

156
00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.593
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

157
00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.880
