00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.000
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:03.660
<v Speaker 1>So here,</v>

3
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.330
<v Speaker 1>here we have a natural disaster happening in our own country.</v>

4
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.460
<v Speaker 1>barreling in,</v>

6
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.230
<v Speaker 1>nobody at burning man knows about it because there's no cell phone service back</v>

7
00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:17.940
<v Speaker 1>in 2007 it's barreling in and a 2005 rather.</v>

8
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.370
<v Speaker 1>And we watch it coming in.</v>

9
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Now the,</v>

10
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.310
<v Speaker 1>the amazing thing was we sought,</v>

11
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.640
<v Speaker 1>you could watch a video for more bit on this screen on this guy's screen and you</v>

12
00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:33.480
<v Speaker 1>could watch people walking down like we saw levy breach,</v>

13
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.690
<v Speaker 1>the first levy breach in like the ninth ward or something.</v>

14
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.110
<v Speaker 1>We saw that on the screen from plot from our camp at burning man.</v>

15
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.200
<v Speaker 1>So when you say you took over satellites,</v>

16
00:00:42.201 --> 00:00:43.620
<v Speaker 1>satellites that are broadcasting,</v>

17
00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:43.951
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

18
00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:47.820
<v Speaker 1>Broadcasting media like it was high Rez.</v>

19
00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:49.770
<v Speaker 1>No Hi-Rez reconnaissance imagery.</v>

20
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.131
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

21
00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:54.240
<v Speaker 1>so it's a satellite that is like one of those spying on bad guy satellites.</v>

22
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.080
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

23
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.913
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

24
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

25
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Eat,</v>

26
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.080
<v Speaker 1>we couldn't read.</v>

27
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.540
<v Speaker 1>You gotta talk about this Ad.</v>

28
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.300
<v Speaker 1>If someone finds out about that,</v>

29
00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:04.440
<v Speaker 1>is that like is this an issue?</v>

30
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:05.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

31
00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:10.881
<v Speaker 1>I mean not like something that would be really frowned upon.</v>

32
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.601
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

33
00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:12.771
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

34
00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:13.604
<v Speaker 1>the phone,</v>

35
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.780
<v Speaker 1>the iridium phone kept ringing.</v>

36
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.681
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

37
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:17.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like your dad's calling,</v>

38
00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:18.511
<v Speaker 1>you're having a party.</v>

39
00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:20.010
<v Speaker 1>The neighbors are calling your dad going,</v>

40
00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:20.844
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

41
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.151
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:22.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what your son's doing,</v>

43
00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:22.620
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

44
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.520
<v Speaker 1>the lights are on,</v>

45
00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:26.580
<v Speaker 1>there's a million people on your front lawn and the phone just keeps ringing and</v>

46
00:01:26.581 --> 00:01:26.910
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

47
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:27.540
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

48
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.760
<v Speaker 1>but these guys knew who they're dealing with.</v>

49
00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:34.410
<v Speaker 1>This is this innovative genius type guy that is totally respected and</v>

50
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.291
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>

51
00:01:35.291 --> 00:01:40.050
<v Speaker 1>So the general that initiated the inquiry was covering for him.</v>

52
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.351
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

53
00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:40.710
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

54
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.350
<v Speaker 1>So the general could then contact space command and say,</v>

55
00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:44.550
<v Speaker 1>I can't get any information.</v>

56
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.631
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

57
00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:45.931
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

58
00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:46.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

59
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.243
<v Speaker 1>So I see.</v>

60
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.500
<v Speaker 1>He had put the satellite in some kind of a failsafe fallback mode.</v>

61
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.770
<v Speaker 1>So they would spend the next several days trying to get back into it.</v>

62
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:56.813
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

63
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.913
<v Speaker 1>He was just like,</v>

64
00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.830
<v Speaker 1>we kept passing it and keep me out,</v>

65
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.040
<v Speaker 1>burn hydrazine and locate,</v>

66
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:02:02.761 --> 00:02:04.110
<v Speaker 1>stuff on the Playa.</v>

68
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.921
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

69
00:02:04.921 --> 00:02:06.000
<v Speaker 1>So how would,</v>

70
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.160
<v Speaker 1>tell me all the details,</v>

71
00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:09.150
<v Speaker 1>but he's at basically,</v>

72
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.500
<v Speaker 1>don't you know,</v>

73
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:11.483
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing this,</v>

74
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.460
<v Speaker 2>nobody was interested in me.</v>

75
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.351
<v Speaker 2>What do you want to hear?</v>

76
00:02:14.351 --> 00:02:15.670
<v Speaker 2>Songs about me being miserable.</v>

77
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.833
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

78
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.100
<v Speaker 2>I would have the day,</v>

79
00:02:18.101 --> 00:02:18.531
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

80
00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:21.180
<v Speaker 2>I was a grand old time and,</v>

81
00:02:21.181 --> 00:02:21.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

82
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.480
<v Speaker 2>reveling in,</v>

83
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.373
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

84
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:24.940
<v Speaker 2>in everything I had,</v>

85
00:02:24.941 --> 00:02:25.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

86
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.900
<v Speaker 2>I grew up wanting a playboy playmate,</v>

87
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

88
00:02:29.561 --> 00:02:30.394
<v Speaker 2>I wanted,</v>

89
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.931
<v Speaker 2>I got all,</v>

90
00:02:31.931 --> 00:02:32.171
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

91
00:02:32.171 --> 00:02:33.220
<v Speaker 2>I got all that stuff.</v>

92
00:02:33.221 --> 00:02:33.820
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

93
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.750
<v Speaker 2>and it was terrific.</v>

94
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.920
<v Speaker 2>The great thing about having things is it gives you a chance to see whether you</v>

95
00:02:38.921 --> 00:02:39.754
<v Speaker 2>really want it,</v>

96
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.283
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

97
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.861
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

98
00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:42.310
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

99
00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.150
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty cool.</v>

100
00:02:43.151 --> 00:02:44.440
<v Speaker 2>People spend their lives,</v>

101
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:45.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

102
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.410
<v Speaker 2>sometimes chasing things that they never get.</v>

103
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.640
<v Speaker 2>I've been very fortunate.</v>

104
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.320
<v Speaker 2>I've pretty much gotten everything I chased and some of it,</v>

105
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.370
<v Speaker 2>it was all worth having,</v>

106
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.440
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't all worth keeping.</v>

107
00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.000
<v Speaker 2>So what you thought it would before you got there,</v>

108
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.880
<v Speaker 2>why did,</v>

109
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I thought that certain things would be the solution and only white</v>

110
00:03:05.981 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 2>playmate.</v>

111
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.071
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

112
00:03:07.071 --> 00:03:07.361
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

113
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:09.070
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't done for Thursday.</v>

114
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:09.940
<v Speaker 2>It was a solution.</v>

115
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:11.603
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

116
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.173
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

117
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.631
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

118
00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:13.930
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

119
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:14.111
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

120
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:14.950
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

121
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.710
<v Speaker 2>my life's been awesome,</v>

122
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.700
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>

123
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.091
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

124
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:19.924
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

125
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.670
<v Speaker 2>it got me to here and,</v>

126
00:03:21.671 --> 00:03:22.504
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

127
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:23.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

128
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 2>when you hear poor me,</v>

129
00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:24.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

130
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:25.870
<v Speaker 2>when you hear people talking,</v>

131
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:26.321
<v Speaker 2>poor me,</v>

132
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:28.210
<v Speaker 2>it's a lonely and you know,</v>

133
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.650

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.000
<v Speaker 2>my life's been great.</v>

135
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

136
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.820
<v Speaker 2>and it's all led me to where I am now.</v>

137
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.361
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

138
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:35.194
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

140
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.890
<v Speaker 2>I have nothing but great memories and no regrets.</v>

141
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.930
<v Speaker 2>So you don't have to go to therapy at all anymore.</v>

142
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.793
<v Speaker 2>You don't do any of that.</v>

143
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:42.370
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

144
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.050
<v Speaker 2>I go sometimes once I,</v>

145
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.071
<v Speaker 2>if I can,</v>

146
00:03:45.071 --> 00:03:45.910
<v Speaker 2>I go once a week,</v>

147
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.870
<v Speaker 2>once a week.</v>

148
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:47.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

149
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.580
<v Speaker 2>As I said to me,</v>

150
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.410
<v Speaker 2>it's not laying on a couch and,</v>

151
00:03:50.411 --> 00:03:51.550
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

152
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:52.271
<v Speaker 2>trying to,</v>

153
00:03:52.271 --> 00:03:55.330
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out a minutia.</v>

154
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.380
<v Speaker 2>It's really a great if,</v>

155
00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.750
<v Speaker 2>if you have a great therapist,</v>

156
00:03:58.751 --> 00:03:59.740
<v Speaker 2>it's great conversation.</v>

157
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:00.723
<v Speaker 2>Literally,</v>

158
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:01.240
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

159
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.073
<v Speaker 2>here's what I did.</v>

160
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.450
<v Speaker 2>I did this this week and you know,</v>

161
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.340
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

162
00:04:06.341 --> 00:04:06.790
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

163
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.870
<v Speaker 2>I call it life school.</v>

164
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 2>It's just kind of,</v>

165
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.203
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

166
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't expect somebody else to be able to tell me what,</v>

167
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.060
<v Speaker 2>what the answer is.</v>

168
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.370
<v Speaker 2>They probably don't have the answer for them.</v>

169
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.833
<v Speaker 2>You know when,</v>

170
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.920
<v Speaker 2>when we put therapists or doctors that when we put anybody on a pedestal where</v>

171
00:04:24.921 --> 00:04:26.200
<v Speaker 2>we're on dangerous ground,</v>

172
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.550
<v Speaker 2>these are just people,</v>

173
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.930
<v Speaker 2>they have their own issues.</v>

174
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.690
<v Speaker 2>They may be great at helping you,</v>

175
00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:34.690
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't mean that they have the answer for them.</v>

176
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.441
<v Speaker 2>We're all,</v>

177
00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:37.570
<v Speaker 2>we're all out there trying to figure it out.</v>

178
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.823
<v Speaker 2>Them too.</v>

179
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:41.283

<v Speaker 1>diets aren't going to work.</v>

182
00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:43.520
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

183
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.741
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

184
00:04:43.741 --> 00:04:45.120
<v Speaker 1>This has to be a lifestyle change,</v>

185
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.261
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

186
00:04:45.261 --> 00:04:48.000
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't like go for three months eating salads and then be like,</v>

187

189
00:04:49.591 --> 00:04:53.290
<v Speaker 1>I got my cholesterol down and got my diabetes down and then going back to it.</v>

190
00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:54.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have to have,</v>

191
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:55.470
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>which I put,</v>

195
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.570
<v Speaker 1>didn't put too much research into his chewing and spitting.</v>

196
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.033
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

197
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.590
<v Speaker 1>I know guys who did that with meat.</v>

198
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.860
<v Speaker 1>There's some MMA fighters like Diego Sanchez was doing that for a while.</v>

199
00:05:10.861 --> 00:05:11.581
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't eat meat.</v>

200
00:05:11.581 --> 00:05:12.450
<v Speaker 1>He would just chew it up.</v>

201
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.490
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible for you.</v>

202
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:14.371
<v Speaker 1>Is it really?</v>

203
00:05:14.371 --> 00:05:16.140
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible for you because first of all,</v>

204
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.760
<v Speaker 1>so you get like,</v>

205
00:05:17.761 --> 00:05:20.910
<v Speaker 1>so I'll order like three entrees,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'll get spaghetti fried chicken,</v>

207
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:23.430
<v Speaker 1>steak,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'll get pie,</v>

209
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.340
<v Speaker 1>I'll order everything.</v>

210
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.460
<v Speaker 1>It's just like Roman Times gluttony to the Max.</v>

211
00:05:29.461 --> 00:05:30.294
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

212
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.080
<v Speaker 1>And I'll have like the worst is if it's at a nice restaurant cause then they</v>

213
00:05:34.081 --> 00:05:34.914
<v Speaker 1>don't have the,</v>

214
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.340
<v Speaker 1>they have like cloth Napkins and I'm like can you bring some more of those paper</v>

215
00:05:38.341 --> 00:05:39.174
<v Speaker 1>Napkins?</v>

216
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.370
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sitting there and I'm like,</v>

217
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.350
<v Speaker 1>and I'm just chewing everything,</v>

218
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.350
<v Speaker 1>getting all the flavor out of it and then I'm spitting it,</v>

219
00:05:46.351 --> 00:05:47.940
<v Speaker 1>which the mouth,</v>

220
00:05:47.941 --> 00:05:50.010
<v Speaker 1>as soon as it starts chewing and making saliva,</v>

221
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.310
<v Speaker 1>the stomach starts making acid to prepare for the food co to come down.</v>

222
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:54.990
<v Speaker 1>But if the food never comes down,</v>

223
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.700
<v Speaker 1>there's just like acid in your stomach,</v>

224
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.770
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

225
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.101
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

226
00:05:58.101 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 1>and also when you eat,</v>

227
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.130
<v Speaker 1>all the sugar already goes into your like before it hits your stomach,</v>

228
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:04.520
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

231
00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:10.340
<v Speaker 1>spitting it and Napkins and then,</v>

232
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.530
<v Speaker 1>and then putting it like on the plate and the dude's comes sooner.</v>

233
00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:15.110
<v Speaker 1>Is there,</v>

00:07:56.811 --> 00:08:00.980
<v Speaker 1>He gets all like a lot of his blood taken out and then they do shit to it.</v>

306
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:05.090
<v Speaker 1>Like they make it into super blood and then he puts it back into them and then</v>
