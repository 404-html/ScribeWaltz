<v Speaker 3>It sounds amazing,</v>

84
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.280

<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of negotiating I'd have to</v>

85
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:14.281
<v Speaker 3>do to get away for a weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta I gotTa plan out like the watch</v>

87
00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:17.620
<v Speaker 3>I had to tell my wife weeks in advance</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that night,</v>

88
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.270
<v Speaker 3>three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

89
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.250
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

90
00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:22.630
<v Speaker 3>you could watch it with me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which he did,</v>

91
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 3>but we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't be responsible putting the kids</v>

92
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:25.630
<v Speaker 3>to bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to</v>

93
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.980
<v Speaker 3>spread that out and make sure and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>remind and like put,</v>

94
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.500
<v Speaker 3>do not book and all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

95
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For three hours.</v>

96
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 3>Getting time away when you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibilities.</v>

97
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:39.370
<v Speaker 3>It's like the more things get</v>
<v Speaker 3>complicated around you,</v>

98
00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 3>like the Biggie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more money,</v>

99
00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:42.680
<v Speaker 3>more problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

100
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean it really get a lot of money</v>
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>

101
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot less problems I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know about that man.</v>

102
00:03:47.801 --> 00:03:49.890
<v Speaker 3>I think you still have tons of problem</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you.</v>

103
00:03:49.891 --> 00:03:50.724
<v Speaker 3>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

104
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.230
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

105
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 3>I believe at that point you can sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>create your own problems if you want to</v>

106
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:57.190
<v Speaker 3>have tons of problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there are people who have a lot of</v>

107
00:03:57.191 --> 00:04:00.110
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got zack down the roaches,</v>

108
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.080

<v Speaker 3>That dude like made his rage against</v>
<v Speaker 3>machine money and it was just peaced out</v>

110
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.090
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>But I like he sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm not saying it doesn't</v>

113
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.440

<v Speaker 3>more problems cause he's trying to like</v>

<v Speaker 3>against machine and pick up that big</v>

118
00:04:27.101 --> 00:04:27.851
<v Speaker 3>check.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other than that,</v>

119
00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:29.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm going back to La.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

120
00:04:29.111 --> 00:04:31.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so for me there's a level of money you</v>

121
00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:33.660
<v Speaker 3>can get where you can sort of just turn</v>
<v Speaker 3>the volume way the guy can.</v>

122
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.680
<v Speaker 3>Calvin and Hobbes is another dude like</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

123
00:04:35.681 --> 00:04:38.270
<v Speaker 3>the chemistry of Calvin and Hobbes was</v>
<v Speaker 3>the biggest comic strip in it.</v>

124
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.420
<v Speaker 3>Like at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people loved it.</v>

125
00:04:40.421 --> 00:04:43.990
<v Speaker 3>People worshiped at some point after 10</v>
<v Speaker 3>years like I'm done and hasn't been seen</v>

126
00:04:43.991 --> 00:04:45.550
<v Speaker 3>since.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good move.</v>

127
00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:46.870
<v Speaker 3>If you could pull it off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's my,</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's my goal.</v>

129
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.550
<v Speaker 3>My goal is to get to that place of like</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something,</v>

130
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the number is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like there's some number</v>

131
00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:54.551
<v Speaker 3>where you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

132
00:04:54.551 --> 00:04:57.180
<v Speaker 3>that's the number where I can put it in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing and the,</v>

133
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.220
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the index things and they sits there</v>

134
00:05:00.221 --> 00:05:00.690

<v Speaker 3>hey everybody,</v>

139
00:05:09.071 --> 00:05:10.900
<v Speaker 3>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have the need for the attention</v>

140
00:05:10.901 --> 00:05:12.360
<v Speaker 3>part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a,</v>

00:05:12.361 --> 00:05:13.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked the work I do and I want to do</v>

142
00:05:13.901 --> 00:05:16.030
<v Speaker 3>the work I like to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't have any need for the star</v>

143
00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:16.864
<v Speaker 3>part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

145
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.980
<v Speaker 3>that becomes a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Way better off with the resources,</v>

146
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:22.390
<v Speaker 3>but no star.</v>

149
00:05:26.231 --> 00:05:29.050
<v Speaker 3>nobody knows their</v>

156
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.850
<v Speaker 3>if Oprah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because oprah is such a huge figure that</v>

157
00:05:42.851 --> 00:05:46.060
<v Speaker 3>nobody's paying attention to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're so focused on her,</v>

158
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're two steps behind,</v>

163
00:05:52.721 --> 00:05:53.800

<v Speaker 3>for a project I worked on,</v>

164
00:05:53.801 --> 00:05:56.640
<v Speaker 3>I actually met Oprah for this thing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's a whole team of people who</v>

165
00:05:56.641 --> 00:05:57.620
<v Speaker 3>are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like</v>

166
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.780
<v Speaker 2>a 40 year old white women who feel like</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in the Israeli army,</v>

167
00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.160
<v Speaker 2>like we will take you down if we need</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

168
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.650
<v Speaker 2>and then oprah floats to the room like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this happy beam of light and they're</v>

169
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:12.590
<v Speaker 2>like the ones who were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

170
00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:15.440
<v Speaker 2>we'll take care of it if it's a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you got to be intensive here around</v>

171
00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:17.660
<v Speaker 2>a person like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine how many people are trying to</v>

172
00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:18.530
<v Speaker 2>grab at Oprah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you get crazy like requests and</v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit all day.</v>

174
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.310
<v Speaker 2>Imagine what it is to be Oprah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>

175
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:25.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see.</v>

176
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.990
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I see if I got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>oprah's level and she's like mean she's</v>

177
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.300
<v Speaker 2>doing a great work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's the own.</v>

178
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.630
<v Speaker 2>There's like she's helping bring other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people up.</v>

179
00:06:32.631 --> 00:06:35.180
<v Speaker 2>She started after the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I had done that show,</v>

180
00:06:35.181 --> 00:06:36.440
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good luck everybody.</v>

181
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:38.663
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

182
00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't have that level of trying to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the thing.</v>

183
00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:44.810
<v Speaker 2>She's got so much power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She kept Dr Oz on TV after they brought</v>

184
00:06:44.811 --> 00:06:48.260
<v Speaker 2>them into congress because he was lying</v>
<v Speaker 2>about miracle weight loss.</v>

185
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.310
<v Speaker 2>Dr Phil still has to show that she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>making money off of the Dr. Phil never</v>

186
00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:53.560
<v Speaker 2>had like a scandal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like no,</v>

187
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.730
<v Speaker 2>but I just feel like he's quietly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

188
00:06:55.731 --> 00:06:58.310
<v Speaker 2>it's not like he was a big deal at one</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

189
00:06:58.311 --> 00:06:59.610
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he still like you turn it on.</v>

190
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.350

191
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's sitting in her chair break.</v>

192
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're like a housewife and you're</v>

193
00:07:06.591 --> 00:07:09.470
<v Speaker 2>sitting at home and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to find out what's wrong with</v>

194
00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:13.160
<v Speaker 2>the teenage kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oprah got sued by meat,</v>

195
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.170
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you and she was on her show and she</v>

196
00:07:15.171 --> 00:07:16.640
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna eat meat anymore because</v>

197
00:07:16.641 --> 00:07:17.474
<v Speaker 2>of red meat.</v>

198
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.480
<v Speaker 2>And it was a whole thing day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>

199
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.670
<v Speaker 2>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of like when I was a court</v>

200
00:07:22.671 --> 00:07:23.860
<v Speaker 2>case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

201
00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:25.740
<v Speaker 2>it was somebody's gonna have to go say</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

202
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.710
<v Speaker 2>He said on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She basically.</v>

203
00:07:27.711 --> 00:07:29.120
<v Speaker 2>I must've been about a particular</v>
<v Speaker 2>company,</v>

204
00:07:29.121 --> 00:07:31.190
<v Speaker 2>but she said something about not eating</v>
<v Speaker 2>red meat anymore.</v>

205
00:07:31.191 --> 00:07:34.670
<v Speaker 2>This was back in the nineties and then I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that's how she met Dr Phil because</v>

206
00:07:34.671 --> 00:07:36.980
<v Speaker 2>he was like a jury consultant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know too much,</v>

207
00:07:36.981 --> 00:07:38.750
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

208
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.200
<v Speaker 2>Oprah Winfrey versus the beef people in</v>
<v Speaker 2>98.</v>

209
00:07:42.201 --> 00:07:43.970
<v Speaker 2>President George Bush.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I have not liked it since.</v>

211
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:48.420
<v Speaker 2>This is a little different people</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

212
00:07:48.421 --> 00:07:49.220
<v Speaker 2>This isn't live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah.</v>

213
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.120
<v Speaker 2>This is an audio story that you should</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to,</v>

214
00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.020
<v Speaker 2>but they're just interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

215
00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she got sued about beat.</v>

216
00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.890
<v Speaker 2>Who fucks odor?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some Meat Corporation in Texas because</v>

217
00:08:00.891 --> 00:08:01.330
<v Speaker 2>she had.</v>

218
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:06.330
<v Speaker 2>She actually had to move her show to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas because she was like testifying.</v>

219
00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:09.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did just say?</v>

220
00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:12.440
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what it was that she says</v>
<v Speaker 2>something on the show about like,</v>

221
00:08:12.441 --> 00:08:14.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I'll eat meat anymore or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

222
00:08:14.301 --> 00:08:17.540
<v Speaker 2>but you can't say that I don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not quoting her directly,</v>

223
00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:20.510
<v Speaker 2>but it was something about a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the mad cow bla bla bla.</v>

<v Speaker 2>probably brought her to Texas.</v>

227
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:33.310
<v Speaker 2>I didn't move her whole show to Texas</v>
<v Speaker 2>because shoot above.</v>

<v Speaker 2>earlier today that shows the contrast</v>

230
00:08:42.051 --> 00:08:45.560
<v Speaker 2>between what Houston used to look like</v>
<v Speaker 2>versus what it looks like now.</v>

233
00:08:49.581 --> 00:08:51.380
<v Speaker 2>People in understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My family's from Alabama,</v>

234
00:08:51.381 --> 00:08:54.110
<v Speaker 2>so I know how hurricanes work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hurricane hits.</v>

235
00:08:54.111 --> 00:08:56.790
<v Speaker 2>That's bad because it things down and</v>
<v Speaker 2>knocks buildings over,</v>

236
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.730
<v Speaker 2>but then the water rises,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's when it gets.</v>

237
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.890
<v Speaker 2>That's the most of the damage done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's done from the flood.</v>

238
00:09:01.891 --> 00:09:06.120
<v Speaker 2>That happens after the hurricane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flood and then mold and fungus.</v>

239
00:09:06.121 --> 00:09:09.150
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of times you have to destroy</v>
<v Speaker 2>houses just because they get ate up with</v>

240
00:09:09.151 --> 00:09:11.250
<v Speaker 2>black mold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like look at the beginning.</v>

241
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.260
<v Speaker 2>If you bring it to the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

242
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.440
<v Speaker 2>and it'll show what Houston used to look</v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

243
00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:16.081
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at this.</v>

244
00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:18.000
<v Speaker 2>You can see the river and now look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

245
00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:18.900
<v Speaker 2>and then it keeps going.</v>

246
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:22.780
<v Speaker 2>This is fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>

247
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.160
<v Speaker 2>Just the river.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Houston is the city that many hurricane</v>

248
00:09:26.161 --> 00:09:27.870
<v Speaker 2>Katrina survivors from New Orleans went</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

249
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you're.</v>

250
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.260
<v Speaker 2>And some of them couldn't go back</v>
<v Speaker 2>because in New Orleans,</v>

251
00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:34.530
<v Speaker 2>New Orleans never got rebuilt and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of ways and so there's people in Houston</v>

252
00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:37.740
<v Speaker 2>right now who moved there because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hurricane Katrina and this happens.</v>

253
00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:40.830
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember I went to Houston like six</v>

254
00:09:40.831 --> 00:09:45.831
<v Speaker 2>months after Hurricane Katrina and there</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a ton of people that were,</v>

255
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.680
<v Speaker 2>that had to move that we're stuck there</v>
<v Speaker 2>that will like piled up together in</v>

256
00:09:49.681 --> 00:09:52.080
<v Speaker 2>houses like many families and small</v>
<v Speaker 2>houses.</v>

257
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.100
<v Speaker 2>Did you hear that Joel osteen thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking</v>

258
00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.730
<v Speaker 2>dare you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lives in a basketball arena.</v>

259
00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean he doesn't live there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but his church is the old Houston</v>

260
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:08.570
<v Speaker 2>Rockets basketball and it's elevated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got 16,000 room for like 16 to</v>

261
00:10:08.761 --> 00:10:11.990
<v Speaker 2>18,000 people in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Won't bring people and now he has got</v>

262
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:12.810
<v Speaker 2>internet shame.</v>

263
00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:14.090
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all I remember.</v>

264
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.750
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes Internet shaming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's okay.</v>

265
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:17.700
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So are these,</v>

266
00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:20.790
<v Speaker 2>the people that are in there now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just how big it is.</v>

267
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:25.500
<v Speaker 2>That's how he bought the place where the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Houston Rockets used to the churches in</v>

268
00:10:25.501 --> 00:10:29.250
<v Speaker 2>a basketball arena and it's all about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the prosperity Gospel,</v>

269
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.980
<v Speaker 2>but he put up a link to donate money for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the flood,</v>

270
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:35.520
<v Speaker 2>went to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't the Red Cross and he was like,</v>

271
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.640
<v Speaker 2>after he got Internet the first time you</v>
<v Speaker 2>put a blink,</v>

272
00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:40.260
<v Speaker 2>donate money for the flood relief here</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was just the link on his website.</v>

273
00:10:40.261 --> 00:10:43.560
<v Speaker 2>It was just a donate to his church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so sketchy.</v>

274
00:10:43.561 --> 00:10:45.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sketchy man.</v>

275
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.520
<v Speaker 2>When you're making billions of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean how long,</v>

276
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:49.800
<v Speaker 2>how much cheese making,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're making that much money for</v>

277
00:10:49.801 --> 00:10:53.130
<v Speaker 2>the Lord and how much tax free tax free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing because he's right</v>

278
00:10:53.131 --> 00:10:54.180
<v Speaker 2>because it's a church.</v>

279
00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:55.530
<v Speaker 2>That's terrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

280
00:10:55.531 --> 00:10:58.060
<v Speaker 2>so he's making twice the money that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have that level of.</v>

281
00:10:58.170 --> 00:10:59.460
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so scary.</v>

282

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's like when you found out the</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's all a bit like you should know if</v>

287
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.440
<v Speaker 2>they're not taking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paying text doesn't make any sense.</v>

288
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.500
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's completely sketchy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and then he said it and now the doors</v>

304
00:11:50.101 --> 00:11:52.860
<v Speaker 2>are open and now they're taking liquids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doors are open.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And let's be clear,</v>

306
00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:58.270
<v Speaker 2>there was apparently somebody tweeted</v>
<v Speaker 2>out that there was like all the mosques</v>

307
00:11:58.271 --> 00:12:00.460
<v Speaker 2>in Houston had opened their doors</v>
<v Speaker 2>already and we're talking.</v>

308
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:01.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

309
00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:07.150
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>

310
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.420

<v Speaker 2>When you stay at like does Joel Olsteen?</v>

311

<v Speaker 2>He must drive like some crazy car too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

312
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:13.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he has many creative.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I want to know what he drives.</v>

314
00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.030
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you it's not even a</v>
<v Speaker 2>cadillac.</v>

315
00:12:19.031 --> 00:12:20.920
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably like some ridiculous</v>

316
00:12:20.921 --> 00:12:21.900
<v Speaker 2>Bentley or something.</v>

317
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.590
<v Speaker 2>Something stupid with like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a golden cross on the hood.</v>

318
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.500
<v Speaker 2>That's the Prosperity Gospel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the preachers rich,</v>

319
00:12:29.501 --> 00:12:31.080
<v Speaker 2>then we're all rich.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the.</v>

320
00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:34.230
<v Speaker 2>Is that what he's preaching?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called the Prosperity Gospel and</v>

321
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.730
<v Speaker 2>it's not just him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's several southern evangelical</v>

322
00:12:36.731 --> 00:12:38.170
<v Speaker 2>preacher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called the prosperity ministry</v>

323
00:12:38.171 --> 00:12:41.920
<v Speaker 2>where you preach that if I do well then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing well through me.</v>

324
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:42.890
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

325
00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:44.650
<v Speaker 2>And then you'll eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually you'll do.</v>

326
00:12:44.651 --> 00:12:47.700
<v Speaker 2>Well eventually it'll come to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's about the.</v>

327
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:50.010
<v Speaker 2>Why would you want the preacher to look</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad if.</v>

328
00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.300
<v Speaker 2>Because the preacher is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>representative of God.</v>

329
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw one where this guy was talking</v>

330
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.720
<v Speaker 2>about people that have no money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you have no money,</v>

331
00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:02.260
<v Speaker 2>if you donate whatever you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you have no money,</v>

332
00:13:02.261 --> 00:13:04.320
<v Speaker 2>the Lord will pay you back tenfold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

333
00:13:04.321 --> 00:13:05.740
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly the thing.</v>

334
00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:07.830
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

335
00:13:07.831 --> 00:13:10.810
<v Speaker 2>It's totally ruthless and it and those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

336
00:13:10.811 --> 00:13:12.810
<v Speaker 2>those people end up falling for their</v>
<v Speaker 2>scandal.</v>

337
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same PTI or the uh,</v>

338
00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:18.880
<v Speaker 2>Tammy Faye Bakker Chin banker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

339
00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.140
<v Speaker 2>It's just so ruthless to go dollar</v>
<v Speaker 2>grief.</v>

340
00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:23.200
<v Speaker 2>Dollar dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

341
00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:25.360
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like hot dogs in the back</v>
<v Speaker 2>of his neck,</v>

342
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:29.590
<v Speaker 2>back of his neck was like these big</v>
<v Speaker 2>thick roles.</v>

343
00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.980
<v Speaker 2>My favorite is Robert Tilden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy would talks in tongues.</v>

344
00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:35.380
<v Speaker 2>He said this once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

345
00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.560
<v Speaker 2>every time you write a check to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Satan gets a black guy.</v>

346
00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.720
<v Speaker 2>Did you find a car for Joel Olsteen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He must have some bomber vehicles.</v>

347
00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.300
<v Speaker 2>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kept trying to find a better,</v>

348
00:13:49.301 --> 00:13:52.390
<v Speaker 2>like official,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like these Ferrari's are coming up.</v>

349
00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:53.290
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>

350
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:55.540

<v Speaker 2>It doesn't like he's not in it,</v>

351
00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:56.351
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

352
00:13:56.351 --> 00:13:57.610
<v Speaker 2>what about that one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one that's in front?</v>

353
00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:58.513
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>

354
00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:00.730
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he lives in river oaks in Houston.</v>

355
00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:05.560
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's his house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put My card down on the left.</v>

356
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:08.200
<v Speaker 2>That the not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really him or not.</v>

357
00:14:08.201 --> 00:14:10.280
<v Speaker 2>It's too small and it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

358
00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:14.590
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't look like him trying harder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll try to find it.</v>

359
00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.150
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forget it.</v>

360
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.550
<v Speaker 2>We have to crack the mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nit picky.</v>

361
00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.780
<v Speaker 2>He's doing fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he doesn't own a car and he's still</v>

362
00:14:22.781 --> 00:14:23.890
<v Speaker 2>doing fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

363
00:14:23.891 --> 00:14:28.720
<v Speaker 2>He's managed to rake up ungodly sums of</v>
<v Speaker 2>money and do so without too much</v>

364
00:14:28.721 --> 00:14:30.190
<v Speaker 2>scandal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

365
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:30.760
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

366
00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:31.593
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's.</v>

367
00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.450
<v Speaker 2>But the money should be the scandal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

368
00:14:34.451 --> 00:14:36.400
<v Speaker 2>like I think that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that,</v>

369
00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:37.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's because,</v>

370
00:14:37.911 --> 00:14:39.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole God thing is caught up in our</v>

371
00:14:39.491 --> 00:14:41.590
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's people in our government who</v>

372
00:14:41.591 --> 00:14:42.950
<v Speaker 2>feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

373
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.530
<v Speaker 2>he's doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This helps me out.</v>

374
00:14:44.531 --> 00:14:45.281
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

375
00:14:45.281 --> 00:14:47.050
<v Speaker 2>I can't be mad at him because I'm trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be like him.</v>

376
00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:50.380
<v Speaker 2>I think had happened during the Reagan</v>
<v Speaker 2>administration.</v>

377
00:14:50.381 --> 00:14:52.130
<v Speaker 2>That's when they first started bringing</v>
<v Speaker 2>in those</v>

378
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:57.130
<v Speaker 3>right wing evangelical people and making</v>
<v Speaker 3>them a part of the Republican Party and</v>

379
00:14:57.171 --> 00:15:00.800
<v Speaker 3>a part of the campaigns and those people</v>
<v Speaker 3>all claimed to have people who follow</v>

380
00:15:00.801 --> 00:15:01.730
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you want them,</v>

381
00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.010
<v Speaker 3>you want them to support you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so yeah,</v>

382
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:07.130
<v Speaker 3>and they will and they will like</v>
<v Speaker 3>loyally.</v>

383
00:15:07.131 --> 00:15:09.670
<v Speaker 3>It's a very creepy situation because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

384
00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:14.200
<v Speaker 3>if you can tap into that market,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you can tap into that market</v>

385
00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.120
<v Speaker 3>now it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Market isn't really clearly is.</v>

386
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.880
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's nothing more than that</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if they had real integrity,</v>

387
00:15:19.881 --> 00:15:21.800
<v Speaker 3>they would leave it out and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

388
00:15:21.801 --> 00:15:24.590
<v Speaker 3>they wouldn't go after those people and</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to use those people to win.</v>

389
00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:26.420
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people are doing God's work.</v>

390
00:15:26.421 --> 00:15:29.570
<v Speaker 3>Let's just help them and prop them up</v>
<v Speaker 3>and leave them alone.</v>

391
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:29.920
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

392
00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.480
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are a pawn the pawn in this whole</v>

393
00:15:32.481 --> 00:15:36.020
<v Speaker 3>little silly game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this game that's got ridiculous.</v>

394
00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:38.360
<v Speaker 3>Like where do we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where are we right now?</v>

395
00:15:38.361 --> 00:15:40.040
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now that you have your show,</v>

396
00:15:40.041 --> 00:15:44.100
<v Speaker 3>you're CNN show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're on CNN so you won't see it</v>

397
00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.950
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you get a fake news?</v>

398
00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:46.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you get that?</v>

399
00:15:46.941 --> 00:15:49.250
<v Speaker 3>Do you get people claiming that you're a</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of fake news?</v>

400
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:50.181
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

401
00:15:50.181 --> 00:15:51.260
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not any.</v>

402
00:15:51.261 --> 00:15:53.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean just like I'm caught up in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>storm,</v>

403
00:15:53.391 --> 00:15:53.840
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

404
00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.130
<v Speaker 3>it's not like it doesn't always come and</v>
<v Speaker 3>meet with somebody was like,</v>

405
00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.720
<v Speaker 3>I did something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like another cnn fake news</v>

406
00:15:59.721 --> 00:16:01.040
<v Speaker 3>journalist and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold on,</v>

407
00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:03.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll take the fake news part,</v>

408
00:16:03.561 --> 00:16:05.450
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not actually a journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Standup comedians.</v>

409
00:16:05.451 --> 00:16:05.961
<v Speaker 3>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

410
00:16:05.961 --> 00:16:07.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean I get caught up in it,</v>

411
00:16:07.461 --> 00:16:10.580
<v Speaker 3>but I think yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't,</v>

412
00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:12.230
<v Speaker 3>it's not coming to me in a way it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming to other people,</v>

413
00:16:12.231 --> 00:16:13.064
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

414
00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.150
<v Speaker 3>The bigger thing for me is that when I</v>
<v Speaker 3>took the job at CNN is that a lot,</v>

415
00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.510
<v Speaker 3>because I live in the bay area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so a lot.</v>

416
00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.300
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are my friends gonna think CNN is</v>

417
00:16:20.301 --> 00:16:23.600
<v Speaker 3>not as much as the right ones to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're the liberal news media to my</v>

418
00:16:23.601 --> 00:16:25.160
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not the liberal news media,</v>

419
00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.350
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what is it to your friends?</v>

420
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:30.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm very middle of the road,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably leaning to the right.</v>

421
00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.550
<v Speaker 3>CNN leans to the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

422
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:33.380
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

423
00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.720
<v Speaker 3>Who the fuck are you hanging out with?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I live in the bay area,</v>

424
00:16:35.721 --> 00:16:37.730
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was out there on Sunday and the rally</v>

425
00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.120
<v Speaker 3>mascot</v>
<v Speaker 3>blocks.</v>

426
00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:43.430
<v Speaker 3>What's the point of that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went out there with my face.</v>

427
00:16:43.431 --> 00:16:45.620
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this celebrity star who showed</v>

428
00:16:45.621 --> 00:16:46.490
<v Speaker 3>up at the rally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

429
00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:47.251
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

430
00:16:47.251 --> 00:16:47.571
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

431
00:16:47.571 --> 00:16:48.760
<v Speaker 3>so because I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

432
00:16:48.761 --> 00:16:50.840
<v Speaker 3>I know the people who started black</v>
<v Speaker 3>lives matter.</v>

433
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.240
<v Speaker 3>I know the people who they don't look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>CNN go,</v>

434
00:16:53.241 --> 00:16:54.830
<v Speaker 3>this is the liberal news media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

435
00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:57.410
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that funny?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all perspective,</v>

436
00:16:57.411 --> 00:16:57.891
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

437
00:16:57.891 --> 00:17:00.530
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are lots of perspectives at CNN</v>

438
00:17:00.531 --> 00:17:04.310
<v Speaker 3>and CNN doesn't tell me to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't tell me to do anything other</v>

439
00:17:04.311 --> 00:17:05.840
<v Speaker 3>than what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to be clear about that,</v>

440
00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:07.460
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying the perception from</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

441
00:17:07.461 --> 00:17:09.920
<v Speaker 3>I think it's funny like some people see</v>
<v Speaker 3>it as the liberal news media and then I</v>

442
00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.040
<v Speaker 3>have friends who see it as as maybe the</v>
<v Speaker 3>center,</v>

443
00:17:13.041 --> 00:17:16.190
<v Speaker 3>but definitely but also or leading to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the left or lean to the right and I'm</v>

444
00:17:16.191 --> 00:17:16.911
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

445
00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:18.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in there and I'm not doing anything</v>

446
00:17:18.891 --> 00:17:20.040
<v Speaker 3>different because I'm there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

447
00:17:20.041 --> 00:17:23.840
<v Speaker 3>you have a different perspective also</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you have essentially an</v>

448
00:17:23.841 --> 00:17:26.240
<v Speaker 3>entertainment show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same as Anthony Bordain,</v>

449
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:29.910
<v Speaker 3>essentially an entertainment Anthony</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bourdain show made my show possible that</v>

450
00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.250
<v Speaker 3>be there without any antibody.</v>

451
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:32.810
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really Jeff Zucker,</v>

452
00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:37.250
<v Speaker 3>Jeff Zucker is a brilliant guy and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>working under him when I was doing</v>

453
00:17:37.251 --> 00:17:38.130
<v Speaker 3>Fairfax factor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

454
00:17:38.131 --> 00:17:38.871
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

455
00:17:38.871 --> 00:17:40.040
<v Speaker 3>I got to meet him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's very,</v>

456
00:17:40.041 --> 00:17:45.041
<v Speaker 3>very smart guy and that was a brilliant</v>
<v Speaker 3>move to have things other than these</v>

457
00:17:45.111 --> 00:17:48.290
<v Speaker 3>shows that just continually show over</v>
<v Speaker 3>and over again.</v>

458
00:17:48.291 --> 00:17:49.650
<v Speaker 3>The collusion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia,</v>

459
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:51.800
<v Speaker 3>collusion with Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia.</v>

460
00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:55.220
<v Speaker 3>Like now it's just like a Houston over</v>
<v Speaker 3>and over,</v>

461
00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:56.820
<v Speaker 3>like you know the sac.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this,</v>

462
00:17:56.821 --> 00:18:00.570
<v Speaker 3>look at this rain over and over again at</v>
<v Speaker 3>anytime during your show.</v>

463
00:18:00.571 --> 00:18:02.220
<v Speaker 3>That's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll be on news network.</v>

464
00:18:02.221 --> 00:18:05.190
<v Speaker 3>Anytime some shit goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will bump your show.</v>

465
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:09.190
<v Speaker 3>Like if I record your show and then I'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to what's this Russia.</v>

466
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:12.820
<v Speaker 3>We have been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People think we've been bumped more than</v>

467
00:18:12.821 --> 00:18:14.700
<v Speaker 3>we have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sunday nights is the best night to be on</v>

468
00:18:14.701 --> 00:18:16.440
<v Speaker 3>the news because the news things don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen,</v>

469
00:18:16.441 --> 00:18:18.840
<v Speaker 3>but we've been bumped for the Orlando</v>
<v Speaker 3>shooter,</v>

470
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.850
<v Speaker 3>which our episode was in Florida that</v>
<v Speaker 3>week.</v>

471
00:18:20.851 --> 00:18:21.241
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

472
00:18:21.241 --> 00:18:23.310
<v Speaker 3>let's take us off the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>

473
00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be looking like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at how fun it is in Florida.</v>

474
00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:30.590
<v Speaker 3>We did a spring break episode.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's not what I know.</v>

475
00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.810
<v Speaker 3>And then we got bumped the last episode</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the season got bumped the camera</v>

476
00:18:33.811 --> 00:18:35.550
<v Speaker 3>where it probably Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember what it's for,</v>

477
00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.800
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we've been bumped twice,</v>

478
00:18:37.801 --> 00:18:40.740
<v Speaker 3>but the people who really hit it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the history of comedy was on CNN on</v>

479
00:18:40.741 --> 00:18:42.360
<v Speaker 3>Thursdays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't be on Thursdays.</v>

480
00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:43.800
<v Speaker 3>Thursdays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

481
00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:46.860
<v Speaker 3>Thursdays the world is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump is tweeting,</v>

482
00:18:46.861 --> 00:18:47.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things are,</v>

483
00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:51.360
<v Speaker 3>things are going on in there and people</v>
<v Speaker 3>are more likely to pay attention to</v>

484
00:18:51.361 --> 00:18:52.890
<v Speaker 3>breaking news on a Thursday and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sunday.</v>

485
00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:56.550
<v Speaker 3>Like it doesn't have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are still keyed into what's</v>

486
00:18:56.551 --> 00:18:58.710
<v Speaker 3>happening today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas on Sunday we're all sort of like</v>

487
00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.770
<v Speaker 3>a take a break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people thought that</v>

488
00:19:01.771 --> 00:19:06.771
<v Speaker 3>when trump got into office he would stop</v>
<v Speaker 3>with all the insult tweets and with all</v>

489
00:19:07.321 --> 00:19:09.750
<v Speaker 3>the stuff that made him a popular</v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

490
00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:12.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then all of a sudden it went from</v>

491
00:19:12.361 --> 00:19:14.430
<v Speaker 3>being like something that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at this guy.</v>

492
00:19:14.431 --> 00:19:15.780
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at him.</v>

493
00:19:15.781 --> 00:19:17.040
<v Speaker 3>He's running for president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

494
00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.590
<v Speaker 3>he's going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's good.</v>

495
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.250
<v Speaker 3>He's our guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then all of a sudden they're like,</v>

496
00:19:20.251 --> 00:19:21.530
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're still here.</v>

497
00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:22.201
<v Speaker 3>You're still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

498
00:19:22.201 --> 00:19:25.050
<v Speaker 3>even right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a midst all of his sort of somewhat.</v>

499
00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:28.530
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Presidential Style tweets about Houston.</v>

500
00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:32.070
<v Speaker 3>There are tweets about his enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can't even like take that.</v>

501
00:19:32.071 --> 00:19:35.790
<v Speaker 3>Let me just not enemy tweet right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's still in the middle of talking</v>

502
00:19:35.791 --> 00:19:37.370
<v Speaker 3>about these things be well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

503
00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.000
<v Speaker 3>Obama just sent out a tweet like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

504
00:19:39.001 --> 00:19:40.830
<v Speaker 3>everybody support the Red Cross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

505
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:41.790
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like that.</v>

506
00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:42.870
<v Speaker 3>Where's that tweet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

507
00:19:42.871 --> 00:19:44.100
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well he doesn't,</v>

508
00:19:44.101 --> 00:19:44.934
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama,</v>

509
00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:48.390
<v Speaker 3>obviously it doesn't have to do anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>and everything he does because it can be</v>

510
00:19:48.391 --> 00:19:51.180
<v Speaker 3>completely from his own thoughts and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't,</v>

511
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:52.350
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't have an agenda.</v>

512
00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:53.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think that,</v>

513
00:19:53.281 --> 00:19:53.821
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

514
00:19:53.821 --> 00:19:56.710
<v Speaker 3>I guess I know people who were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's time to have some thoughts in</v>

515
00:19:56.711 --> 00:20:00.700
<v Speaker 3>an agenda as we were sort of in a Bama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

516
00:20:00.701 --> 00:20:01.180
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

517
00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.690
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a written article that said</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't read the article with the</v>

518
00:20:03.691 --> 00:20:04.401
<v Speaker 3>headline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>said something.</v>

519
00:20:04.401 --> 00:20:05.580
<v Speaker 3>Be honest about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama,</v>

520
00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:06.520
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

521
00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:10.080
<v Speaker 3>the thought is that he's going to come</v>
<v Speaker 3>back in the fall to help rebuild the</v>

522
00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.460
<v Speaker 3>Democratic Party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I feel like we don't,</v>

523
00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:12.990
<v Speaker 3>if we're going to be here in the fall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

524
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:14.700
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are you waiting?</v>

525
00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.200
<v Speaker 3>What's going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why aren't you here?</v>

526
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.850
<v Speaker 3>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why put that off?</v>

527
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.690
<v Speaker 3>Like things are happening now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

528
00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:22.350
<v Speaker 3>now I get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's playing like that star trek chest</v>

529
00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:24.960
<v Speaker 3>where it's three levels and things are</v>
<v Speaker 3>happening and he's seeing things I can't</v>

530
00:20:24.961 --> 00:20:27.840
<v Speaker 3>see and he sees the matrix,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like</v>

531
00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.980
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to see you before the fall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though the falls only like two</v>

532
00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:34.020
<v Speaker 3>weeks away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What could he do other than,</v>

533
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got a lot of money or certainly has</v>

534
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.440
<v Speaker 3>access to a lot of money for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which means you have a lot of him and he</v>

535
00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:40.920
<v Speaker 3>has it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He still has a lot of influence,</v>

536
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:43.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't know what.</v>

537
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what he could do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he could do.</v>

538
00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:46.650
<v Speaker 3>He could do something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

539
00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.020
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

540
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.960
<v Speaker 2>even if you just responded to every</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump tweet,</v>

541
00:20:49.961 --> 00:20:50.920
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>

542
00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:52.990
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I think there's,</v>

543
00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:54.220
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

544
00:20:54.221 --> 00:20:57.100
<v Speaker 2>he's amassing power for something and</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe he's got some plan that I'll be</v>

545
00:20:57.101 --> 00:20:58.180
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

546
00:20:58.181 --> 00:21:00.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just feel like he certainly is.</v>

547
00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:02.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's still one of the most influential</v>

548
00:21:02.801 --> 00:21:04.290
<v Speaker 2>people on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet,</v>

549
00:21:04.291 --> 00:21:07.410
<v Speaker 2>when you talk about like the three level</v>
<v Speaker 2>testing or multilevel chesting,</v>

550
00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:10.510
<v Speaker 2>you gotta wonder like at what point in</v>
<v Speaker 2>time does a,</v>

551
00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:15.790
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a candidate from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Democratic Party arrive?</v>

552
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.680
<v Speaker 2>Like where are they and who are they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And are they thinking,</v>

553
00:21:19.681 --> 00:21:21.530
<v Speaker 2>you mean is it Gavin newsome?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it,</v>

554
00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:22.840
<v Speaker 2>who is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

555
00:21:22.841 --> 00:21:23.674
<v Speaker 2>I hope it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

556
00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:25.870
<v Speaker 2>I guess I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will say this,</v>

557
00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.120
<v Speaker 2>I think my party affiliation is</v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrat,</v>

558
00:21:28.121 --> 00:21:31.570
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not somebody who's like repping</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Democratic Party is people sometimes</v>

559
00:21:31.571 --> 00:21:34.210
<v Speaker 2>think I am just because I'm against</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump.</v>

560
00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:36.040
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

561
00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.500
<v Speaker 2>so I would say this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I hope that that person is somebody</v>

562
00:21:38.501 --> 00:21:40.540
<v Speaker 2>whose name we don't even know yet</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I feel like the thing that</v>

563
00:21:40.541 --> 00:21:42.550
<v Speaker 2>happened with Obama as he came out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>nowhere,</v>

564
00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:46.690
<v Speaker 2>and I think if you go to the usual</v>
<v Speaker 2>suspects with the way the current</v>

565
00:21:46.691 --> 00:21:47.730
<v Speaker 2>stories current setup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doomed.</v>

566
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.810
<v Speaker 2>If the electoral college is still in</v>
<v Speaker 2>place in four years,</v>

567
00:21:49.811 --> 00:21:51.910
<v Speaker 2>then then we're doomed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we go to the usual suspects,</v>

568
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.340
<v Speaker 2>well Obama might've come out of nowhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people were looking at him</v>

569
00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.380
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy here,</v>

570
00:21:56.381 --> 00:21:58.300
<v Speaker 2>you got this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harvard educated,</v>

571
00:21:58.301 --> 00:22:01.840
<v Speaker 2>very articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good looking smooth,</v>

572
00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:03.870
<v Speaker 2>clean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clean is Joe Biden said he was.</v>

573
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.680
<v Speaker 2>He was calm like that was the most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you look at the way trump has been</v>

574
00:22:08.681 --> 00:22:11.110
<v Speaker 2>responding to all these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how he freaks out when he gets a small</v>

575
00:22:11.111 --> 00:22:12.940
<v Speaker 2>crowd in Arizona at a press conference.</v>

576
00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:16.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing about Obama that stands out</v>

577
00:22:16.151 --> 00:22:18.220
<v Speaker 2>more than anything was his composure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

578
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:19.900
<v Speaker 2>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He felt like the adult in the room,</v>

579
00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.780
<v Speaker 2>whether you agreed with him or not</v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily didn't agree with everything</v>

580
00:22:22.781 --> 00:22:24.670
<v Speaker 2>he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He felt like a grownup who was making</v>

581
00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.730
<v Speaker 2>thoughtful adult decisions that</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I disagreed with,</v>

582
00:22:27.731 --> 00:22:29.740
<v Speaker 2>but I knew he had thought them through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

583
00:22:29.741 --> 00:22:33.130
<v Speaker 2>and also one of the most important</v>
<v Speaker 2>things about being a president is the</v>

584
00:22:33.131 --> 00:22:37.630
<v Speaker 2>president sort of sets the tone for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of the country.</v>

585
00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:41.770
<v Speaker 2>Like he represents the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when the president represents the</v>

586
00:22:41.771 --> 00:22:46.750
<v Speaker 2>country and he's talking shit about</v>
<v Speaker 2>people bleeding from plastic surgery and</v>

587
00:22:46.751 --> 00:22:49.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fake news and yelling about this and</v>

588
00:22:49.321 --> 00:22:51.790
<v Speaker 2>then saying things that are just</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely not true,</v>

589
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.010
<v Speaker 2>it turned out to not be true and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

590
00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:56.320
<v Speaker 2>and you have to like look at it and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you vet it out and you go,</v>

591
00:22:56.321 --> 00:22:58.840
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>homies fucking lying and all the</v>

592
00:22:58.841 --> 00:23:03.280
<v Speaker 2>associating with people with known</v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy theorists and you know,</v>

593
00:23:03.281 --> 00:23:07.680
<v Speaker 2>and white supremacists and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me it's like you're again,</v>

594
00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:10.420
<v Speaker 2>you're saying you setting the tone for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the country and all those people feel</v>

595
00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:14.950
<v Speaker 2>certainly embolden by him and empowered</v>
<v Speaker 2>by him in a way that is not healthy for</v>

596
00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:15.700
<v Speaker 2>the country.</v>

597
00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if he doesn't support them,</v>

598
00:23:17.201 --> 00:23:19.150
<v Speaker 2>that whole wink and a nod.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

599
00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:20.520
<v Speaker 2>It's very sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

600
00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:22.990
<v Speaker 2>most of you as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know that most of communication is</v>

601
00:23:22.991 --> 00:23:24.230
<v Speaker 2>nonverbal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

602
00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:26.890
<v Speaker 2>So the fact that he doesn't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it sounds like he's saying the</v>

603
00:23:26.891 --> 00:23:28.630
<v Speaker 2>right thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's not landing with the people,</v>

604
00:23:28.631 --> 00:23:30.670
<v Speaker 2>he's talking about the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if he says,</v>

605
00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:33.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I support the blacks or whatever it is,</v>

606
00:23:33.011 --> 00:23:34.930
<v Speaker 2>it's like if it doesn't feel like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the blacks,</v>

607
00:23:34.931 --> 00:23:36.250
<v Speaker 2>then it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean anything.</v>

608
00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people know when you're saying something</v>

609
00:23:39.341 --> 00:23:42.070
<v Speaker 2>from the heart versus when you're saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>something for damage control.</v>

610
00:23:42.071 --> 00:23:44.240
<v Speaker 2>Like Charlottesville,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when he came out after</v>

611
00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:47.690
<v Speaker 2>Charlottesville and said that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>were behaving badly on all sides,</v>

612
00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:51.260
<v Speaker 2>on all sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you get out Nazi that ran over a</v>

613
00:23:51.261 --> 00:23:53.120
<v Speaker 2>crowd of protestors?</v>

614
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:56.690
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he hit the gas and ran over other white</v>

615
00:23:56.691 --> 00:23:59.600
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You dumb fuck this.</v>

616
00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:02.780
<v Speaker 2>This is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to say on all sides.</v>

617
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:05.690
<v Speaker 2>This is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he improvised that part.</v>

618
00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.970
<v Speaker 2>That was not in the speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

619
00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:09.320
<v Speaker 2>that was his riff on all sides because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was it.</v>

620
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:11.060
<v Speaker 2>I think it had been written for him and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

621
00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:11.991
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

622
00:24:11.991 --> 00:24:16.100
<v Speaker 2>I gotta I gotta put some magic in here</v>
<v Speaker 2>while I am of the belief that</v>

623
00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:21.410
<v Speaker 2>nonviolence is always the answer and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that running around with masks on</v>

624
00:24:21.411 --> 00:24:25.390
<v Speaker 2>hitting people with bike locks were</v>
<v Speaker 2>showing up with sticks and bats and the</v>

625
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:29.480
<v Speaker 2>shit that people are trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think although their heart and their</v>

626
00:24:29.481 --> 00:24:32.860
<v Speaker 2>mind might be in the right place when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you show up with,</v>

627
00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:36.410
<v Speaker 2>with bulletproof vests on and helmets</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sticks,</v>

628
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:40.940
<v Speaker 2>people see that and that is an act of</v>
<v Speaker 2>aggression and the opposition is going</v>

629
00:24:40.941 --> 00:24:44.210
<v Speaker 2>to show up in turn with something</v>
<v Speaker 2>similar or worse.</v>

630
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:45.890
<v Speaker 2>It escalates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

631
00:24:45.891 --> 00:24:48.110
<v Speaker 2>I think the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that I was in Berkeley,</v>

632
00:24:48.111 --> 00:24:51.020
<v Speaker 2>like I said in the weekend at the no</v>
<v Speaker 2>hate in the bay rally that was supposed</v>

633
00:24:51.021 --> 00:24:51.580
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

634
00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:53.910
<v Speaker 2>that whoever said they were going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>show outright,</v>

635
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:55.880
<v Speaker 2>people will also be named white</v>
<v Speaker 2>supremacists.</v>

636
00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.940
<v Speaker 2>They were going to show up like 40,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people showed up.</v>

637
00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:02.240
<v Speaker 2>But somewhere between three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three and 4,000 people on which side?</v>

638
00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:05.360
<v Speaker 2>Mostly on the side of not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the.</v>

639
00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:07.530
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so all told.</v>

640
00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:07.951
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

641
00:25:07.951 --> 00:25:09.150
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was like the,</v>

642
00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.270
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the side who was like,</v>

643
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:12.890
<v Speaker 2>not in our streets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is Berkeley.</v>

644
00:25:12.891 --> 00:25:15.170
<v Speaker 2>We don't play this shit right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was way over.</v>

645
00:25:15.171 --> 00:25:18.140
<v Speaker 2>Was Way bigger than the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than the side from the white supremacy.</v>

646
00:25:18.141 --> 00:25:18.740
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Side.</v>

647
00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.510
<v Speaker 2>It was not even close as it was in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boston.</v>

648
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:21.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

649
00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.180
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

650
00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:26.900
<v Speaker 2>and overwhelmingly there was like 13</v>
<v Speaker 2>arrests and as many people pointed out</v>

651
00:25:26.901 --> 00:25:28.430
<v Speaker 2>there's more rested a raider team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

652
00:25:28.431 --> 00:25:30.530
<v Speaker 2>like it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a lot of arrests and sometimes</v>

653
00:25:30.531 --> 00:25:31.660
<v Speaker 2>you get arrested because they were like</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

654
00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:35.180
<v Speaker 2>get you the fuck out of here or this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a safety issue or you know,</v>

655
00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:37.190
<v Speaker 2>so it's like 13 arrests and people were</v>
<v Speaker 2>injured.</v>

656
00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:41.240
<v Speaker 2>No deaths thankfully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at all the mainstream</v>

657
00:25:41.241 --> 00:25:42.260
<v Speaker 2>news reports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

658
00:25:42.261 --> 00:25:45.920
<v Speaker 2>it focuses on those people who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Antifa or the people who were the</v>

659
00:25:45.921 --> 00:25:49.850
<v Speaker 2>black bloc anarchists who were there to</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fight with people and,</v>

660
00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:52.280
<v Speaker 2>and for pe I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was old people there,</v>

661
00:25:52.281 --> 00:25:53.960
<v Speaker 2>there was young people there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

662
00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.280
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend who was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

663
00:25:55.281 --> 00:25:56.990
<v Speaker 2>I got an alert on my phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It said that,</v>

664
00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there was a tear gas and I was in</v>

665
00:25:59.511 --> 00:26:00.710
<v Speaker 2>the rally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's tear gas,</v>

666
00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:04.430
<v Speaker 2>like he's in the middle of the rally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>CNN or the San Francisco Chronicle is</v>

667
00:26:04.431 --> 00:26:05.660
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's tear gas in Berkeley.</v>

668
00:26:05.661 --> 00:26:06.500
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is.</v>

669
00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:08.420
<v Speaker 2>And all that stuff got played</v>
<v Speaker 2>overplayed.</v>

670
00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:10.370
<v Speaker 2>And I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My wife was there and it was a,</v>

671
00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:12.830
<v Speaker 2>it was a very beautiful day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Despite the,</v>

672
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:14.630
<v Speaker 2>despite the reason why the day to come</v>
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>

673
00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:15.680
<v Speaker 2>well that's a real problem.</v>

674
00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.320
<v Speaker 2>And that the media needs something to</v>
<v Speaker 2>bleed.</v>

675
00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:22.130
<v Speaker 2>They need some tear gas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they need a riot in order to get clicks.</v>

676
00:26:22.131 --> 00:26:24.890
<v Speaker 2>It's just like that New York Times</v>
<v Speaker 2>article that I'd talked about with the</v>

677
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.050
<v Speaker 2>economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mcgregor's face being completely</v>

678
00:26:27.051 --> 00:26:28.670
<v Speaker 2>bloodied and fall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

679
00:26:28.671 --> 00:26:31.820
<v Speaker 2>that's you doing that because you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to sell newspapers,</v>

680
00:26:31.821 --> 00:26:35.000
<v Speaker 2>not because that's what happened and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't hired anybody there on staff who</v>

681
00:26:35.001 --> 00:26:38.450
<v Speaker 2>actually knows the UFC or boxing or</v>
<v Speaker 2>knows combat sports.</v>

682
00:26:38.451 --> 00:26:40.730
<v Speaker 2>Like that's to me it's like we need an</v>
<v Speaker 2>article about this.</v>

683
00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:42.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also having someone with a</v>

684
00:26:42.381 --> 00:26:44.460
<v Speaker 2>perspective would go to that rally and</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

685
00:26:44.461 --> 00:26:48.240
<v Speaker 2>look how many people were here that</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in equality,</v>

686
00:26:48.241 --> 00:26:50.820
<v Speaker 2>that believe in unity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that believe in peace,</v>

687
00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:56.030
<v Speaker 2>that just want to support this idea that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the community is filled with way more of</v>

688
00:26:56.401 --> 00:27:01.200
<v Speaker 2>those people and the people with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bike locks and the face masks and you're</v>

689
00:27:01.201 --> 00:27:04.120
<v Speaker 2>talking about a few scrambled</v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals.</v>

690
00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:06.330
<v Speaker 2>People you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here's the thing about those people,</v>

691
00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:08.550
<v Speaker 2>they don't show up when it's just a</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful day at the park.</v>

692
00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:10.200
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody.</v>

693
00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:12.600
<v Speaker 2>I live in Berkeley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's walking through Brooklyn who</v>

694
00:27:12.601 --> 00:27:14.520
<v Speaker 2>god is and t for about to show up to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>farmer's market.</v>

695
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:17.940
<v Speaker 2>Like those people don't show up unless</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shit hit the less they feel like the</v>

696
00:27:17.941 --> 00:27:21.660
<v Speaker 2>shit is hitting the fan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what concerns me is that those</v>

697
00:27:21.661 --> 00:27:24.180
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're wearing the bike masks or</v>

698
00:27:24.181 --> 00:27:28.350
<v Speaker 2>the the masks and the fucking vests and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the knee pads and all the shit,</v>

699
00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:32.310
<v Speaker 2>that's where you get those assholes in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Charlotte that showed up with guns,</v>

700
00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:36.720
<v Speaker 2>like those guys that were open carrying</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Charlotte with bulletproof vests on</v>

701
00:27:36.721 --> 00:27:39.930
<v Speaker 2>walking on the street showing trigger</v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline with their finger on the</v>

702
00:27:39.931 --> 00:27:40.800
<v Speaker 2>outside of the gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

703
00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:45.000
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck is this allowed and dressed</v>
<v Speaker 2>and many of them just in the military</v>

704
00:27:45.001 --> 00:27:45.390
<v Speaker 2>garb.</v>

705
00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:47.540
<v Speaker 2>So they looked like they were part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the military.</v>

706
00:27:47.541 --> 00:27:49.050
<v Speaker 2>It was like they were part of law</v>
<v Speaker 2>enforcement.</v>

707
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:50.970
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that was the real problem too is</v>

708
00:27:50.971 --> 00:27:53.730
<v Speaker 2>people thought they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people were confused and thought</v>

709
00:27:53.731 --> 00:27:56.160
<v Speaker 2>they were on there like they were part</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the part of law enforcement.</v>

710
00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.650
<v Speaker 2>I think the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing about Antifa I would say this</v>

711
00:27:58.651 --> 00:28:01.980
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the reason why Antifa even has a</v>

712
00:28:01.981 --> 00:28:05.670
<v Speaker 2>room to exist is because people in those</v>
<v Speaker 2>communities don't think they can count</v>

713
00:28:05.671 --> 00:28:07.520
<v Speaker 2>on the police,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

714
00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:09.570
<v Speaker 2>because the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were two other</v>

715
00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:13.410
<v Speaker 2>protests in Berkeley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's that it erupted in violence</v>

716
00:28:13.411 --> 00:28:15.300
<v Speaker 2>because the police were standing by</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching it happen.</v>

717
00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.040
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't go in and break it up and</v>

718
00:28:17.041 --> 00:28:20.220
<v Speaker 2>that certainly happened in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Charlottesville to what's been said,</v>

719
00:28:20.221 --> 00:28:23.190
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know if this is true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's been said that the police were</v>

720
00:28:23.191 --> 00:28:26.820
<v Speaker 2>instructed in Berkeley to not engage</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the anarchists.</v>

721
00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:28.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how that works.</v>

722
00:28:28.501 --> 00:28:31.120
<v Speaker 2>I know the mayor of Berkeley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

723
00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:33.930
<v Speaker 2>And then I found this out recently that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mayor of Berkeley is now in charge</v>

724
00:28:33.931 --> 00:28:36.210
<v Speaker 2>of the police,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I'm like then what's the point of</v>

725
00:28:36.211 --> 00:28:38.310
<v Speaker 2>being the mayor?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was in charge to achieve.</v>

726
00:28:38.311 --> 00:28:40.980
<v Speaker 2>I guess the chief was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had never heard of that before for</v>

727
00:28:40.981 --> 00:28:42.990
<v Speaker 2>NATO.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Green told me that he talked to the</v>

728
00:28:42.991 --> 00:28:43.381
<v Speaker 2>mayor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

729
00:28:43.381 --> 00:28:44.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm not actually in charge of police,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>

730
00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:49.200
<v Speaker 2>why are we listening to you talk to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>boss because how the fuck are the mayor</v>

731
00:28:49.201 --> 00:28:52.800
<v Speaker 2>have enough time to be paying attention</v>
<v Speaker 2>to every single issue that the police</v>

732
00:28:52.801 --> 00:28:55.440
<v Speaker 2>have to deal with when he's dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single issue that merits to deal</v>

733
00:28:55.441 --> 00:28:57.060
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that means that the president is in</v>

734
00:28:57.061 --> 00:28:59.150
<v Speaker 2>charge of the military sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's.</v>

735
00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:02.370
<v Speaker 2>So it's one of the things that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>president has done is sort of given the</v>

736
00:29:02.371 --> 00:29:05.940
<v Speaker 2>power to the generals and that's one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that the military really</v>

737
00:29:05.941 --> 00:29:07.710
<v Speaker 2>enjoys about trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

738
00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:10.530
<v Speaker 2>As opposed to any other presidents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They feel like the handcuffs are off.</v>

739
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:12.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think that at the end of the day,</v>

740
00:29:12.541 --> 00:29:13.960
<v Speaker 2>the president can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

741
00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.080
<v Speaker 2>Kim consult with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he tells the generals go do this</v>

742
00:29:16.081 --> 00:29:16.770
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have,</v>

743
00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:18.750
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I feel like that's the kind of.</v>

744
00:29:18.751 --> 00:29:19.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

745
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think the president has too</v>

746
00:29:21.031 --> 00:29:23.700
<v Speaker 2>much power of the president is you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many people have reported can launch</v>

747
00:29:23.701 --> 00:29:25.860
<v Speaker 2>nukes if he wants to now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it would have to,</v>

748
00:29:25.861 --> 00:29:28.710
<v Speaker 2>somebody would have to like violate his</v>
<v Speaker 2>order to not launch the nukes.</v>

749
00:29:28.711 --> 00:29:32.070
<v Speaker 2>So I think there's too much power there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I do think it's weird that the</v>

750
00:29:32.071 --> 00:29:34.890
<v Speaker 2>person who you elect to lead the city</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't in charge of the,</v>

751
00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:35.850
<v Speaker 2>of law enforcement.</v>

752
00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:37.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as he.</v>

753
00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.620
<v Speaker 2>Pardon Joe Arpaio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when everybody went.</v>

754
00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:43.120
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no.</v>

755
00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no serious debate.</v>

756
00:29:44.921 --> 00:29:47.550
<v Speaker 2>The problem is now we have debate about</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that were there.</v>

757
00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.930
<v Speaker 2>These aren't two equal sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not many sides.</v>

758
00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:53.380
<v Speaker 2>There's nobody who seriously knows the</v>
<v Speaker 2>law or knows or knows what.</v>

759
00:29:53.381 --> 00:29:56.050
<v Speaker 2>Joel prior history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who believes he did was not guilty of</v>

760
00:29:56.051 --> 00:29:57.640
<v Speaker 2>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He bragged about the things that you're</v>

761
00:29:57.641 --> 00:30:00.070
<v Speaker 2>profiling people and bragged about</v>
<v Speaker 2>abusing people.</v>

762
00:30:00.071 --> 00:30:04.560
<v Speaker 2>So there's nobody to about people dying</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his prisons because they had heat</v>

763
00:30:04.561 --> 00:30:05.420
<v Speaker 2>stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

764
00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:09.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean he couldn't get cold water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people are out in tents at 120</v>

765
00:30:09.011 --> 00:30:09.890
<v Speaker 2>degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

766
00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:12.200
<v Speaker 2>There's an article that somebody wrote</v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

767
00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:15.550
<v Speaker 2>This kid was born in Tijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lived in Arizona,</v>

768
00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:19.480
<v Speaker 2>and got arrested for drunk driving and</v>
<v Speaker 2>spent a year in those,</v>

769
00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:20.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those camps,</v>

770
00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:21.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

771
00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:23.980
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was raised in America is essentially</v>

772
00:30:23.981 --> 00:30:27.940
<v Speaker 2>an American even though he was born in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wrong patch of dirt for some people.</v>

773
00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:29.170
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's an American.</v>

774
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:33.610
<v Speaker 2>He just got arrested for drunk driving</v>
<v Speaker 2>and did a year in this tent and was</v>

775
00:30:33.611 --> 00:30:37.540
<v Speaker 2>talking about how people died around him</v>
<v Speaker 2>and talking about the food that they ate</v>

776
00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:40.590
<v Speaker 2>and how ruthless that can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

777
00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:43.420
<v Speaker 2>some people have this opinion of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

778
00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:45.480
<v Speaker 2>well then don't break the law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

779
00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:49.210
<v Speaker 2>that is a god damned convenient way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at it and not.</v>

780
00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:53.380
<v Speaker 2>It's just not very humane and not very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not what we're supposed to be in this</v>

781
00:30:53.381 --> 00:30:53.981
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

782
00:30:53.981 --> 00:30:56.110
<v Speaker 2>we're not supposed to be a country that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that.</v>

783
00:30:56.111 --> 00:30:57.850
<v Speaker 2>Is that punitive with the law?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We often are.</v>

784
00:30:58.030 --> 00:30:59.710
<v Speaker 2>And also we know the one thing we know</v>
<v Speaker 2>what America is,</v>

785
00:30:59.711 --> 00:31:02.140
<v Speaker 2>that the law is not equally applied to</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>

786
00:31:02.141 --> 00:31:04.180
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a rich guy,</v>

787
00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:07.660
<v Speaker 2>rich white guy drove drunk driving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to prison for a year</v>

788
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:11.050
<v Speaker 2>pilot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which rich white guys in jail.</v>

789
00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:13.360
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it in that prison?</v>

790
00:31:13.361 --> 00:31:16.300
<v Speaker 2>Was he going to the outside hot prison?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He threw a lot of people in that hot</v>

791
00:31:16.301 --> 00:31:20.960
<v Speaker 2>prison and he's a cunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I was talking nationally,</v>

792
00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:25.030
<v Speaker 2>but our pilot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that the law is not applied equally</v>

793
00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:27.610
<v Speaker 2>to everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that we know that if you have</v>

794
00:31:27.611 --> 00:31:29.740
<v Speaker 2>money in been privileged you can get out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of situations,</v>

795
00:31:29.741 --> 00:31:32.500
<v Speaker 2>but that other people don't have money</v>
<v Speaker 2>and privilege can't get out of here.</v>

796
00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:35.360
<v Speaker 2>I know comedians that have been arrested</v>
<v Speaker 2>in La for drunk driving,</v>

797
00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:40.030
<v Speaker 2>they never did a day in jail and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>one kid who was born in Tijuana does a</v>

798
00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:41.640
<v Speaker 2>year in a tent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

799
00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:42.790
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

800
00:31:42.791 --> 00:31:44.050
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't drunk drive.</v>

801
00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:44.471
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

802
00:31:44.471 --> 00:31:47.050
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I feel was the punishment.</v>

803
00:31:47.051 --> 00:31:47.884
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be.</v>

804
00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:49.870
<v Speaker 2>You should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you break the law,</v>

805
00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:54.370
<v Speaker 2>there should be repercussions because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have control of your body and</v>

806
00:31:54.371 --> 00:31:57.550
<v Speaker 2>you're driving a deadly vehicle and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could crash into a family.</v>

807
00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:58.720
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of real,</v>

808
00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:01.150
<v Speaker 2>real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real issues with the law.</v>

809
00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:02.350
<v Speaker 2>Like I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I did,</v>

810
00:32:02.351 --> 00:32:04.630
<v Speaker 2>we did an episode of united shades in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first season about St Clinton,</v>

811
00:32:04.631 --> 00:32:07.750
<v Speaker 2>about lifers in prison and St Clinton</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I talked to a lot of guys.</v>

812
00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:09.250
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of the guys I talked to said they</v>

813
00:32:09.251 --> 00:32:10.390
<v Speaker 2>didn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody that talks like,</v>

814
00:32:10.391 --> 00:32:12.460
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it like I'm guilty of thing.</v>

815
00:32:12.461 --> 00:32:14.020
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you heard what they did,</v>

816
00:32:14.021 --> 00:32:16.060
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that life in prison?</v>

817
00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.050
<v Speaker 2>What do you get?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

818
00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:21.430
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy who was convicted of</v>
<v Speaker 2>robbing two banks that he,</v>

819
00:32:21.431 --> 00:32:22.690
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's bad.</v>

820
00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:24.340
<v Speaker 2>Let's say that's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely bad.</v>

821
00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.630
<v Speaker 2>Nobody died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody got hurt.</v>

822
00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.700
<v Speaker 2>Certainly people were traumatized by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that robbed the bank.</v>

823
00:32:27.701 --> 00:32:29.530
<v Speaker 2>He didn't even have a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did the thing because you could rob a</v>

824
00:32:29.531 --> 00:32:31.060
<v Speaker 2>bank by just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me the money.</v>

825
00:32:31.061 --> 00:32:31.871
<v Speaker 2>I have a bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

826
00:32:31.871 --> 00:32:32.704
<v Speaker 2>like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can.</v>

827
00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:34.330
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but didn't have any weapons,</v>

828
00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:35.950
<v Speaker 2>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that's bad.</v>

829
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:38.320
<v Speaker 2>But he's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's probably in his sixties now and I</v>

830
00:32:38.321 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 2>met him and he's one of the coolest</v>
<v Speaker 2>people I've</v>

831
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:41.270
<v Speaker 3>met.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a leader in prison.</v>

832
00:32:41.271 --> 00:32:44.180
<v Speaker 3>He's one of the guys who runs the</v>
<v Speaker 3>newspaper and he invited me.</v>

833
00:32:44.181 --> 00:32:45.390
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he talked to my agent was like,</v>

834
00:32:45.391 --> 00:32:47.090
<v Speaker 3>you're coming back in September to speak</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the guys.</v>

835
00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.670
<v Speaker 3>Like he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a total leader and he's in prison</v>

836
00:32:49.671 --> 00:32:53.900
<v Speaker 3>for life for the rest of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Joe Pile.</v>

837
00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:57.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our is directly responsible for people</v>

838
00:32:57.081 --> 00:32:58.430
<v Speaker 3>being dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

839
00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:00.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a ton of people that have</v>

840
00:33:00.651 --> 00:33:03.380
<v Speaker 3>mysteriously died inside that guy's</v>
<v Speaker 3>prisons and,</v>

841
00:33:03.381 --> 00:33:04.580
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the part about me.</v>

842
00:33:04.581 --> 00:33:07.250
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not the same scales of justice</v>

843
00:33:07.251 --> 00:33:09.140
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know there's a guy who got a third</v>

844
00:33:09.141 --> 00:33:11.540
<v Speaker 3>strike in California because no</v>
<v Speaker 3>California third strike law that</v>

845
00:33:11.541 --> 00:33:14.270
<v Speaker 3>happened for firing a gun in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's bad,</v>

846
00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:17.630
<v Speaker 3>but that ended up with them getting life</v>
<v Speaker 3>in prison and you're just like,</v>

847
00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:20.210
<v Speaker 3>it's bad.</v>

848
00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:21.310
<v Speaker 3>It's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

849
00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:23.210
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'd have to say that enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying let every,</v>

850
00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.880
<v Speaker 3>every inmate out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying it's bad,</v>

851
00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:27.830
<v Speaker 3>but life in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

852
00:33:27.831 --> 00:33:29.780
<v Speaker 3>the idea that you could never reform</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

853
00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:31.850
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems insane.</v>

854
00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:32.600
<v Speaker 3>And the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

855
00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.500
<v Speaker 3>I guess there's the other perspective is</v>
<v Speaker 3>where are the resources going to come</v>

856
00:33:36.501 --> 00:33:39.080
<v Speaker 3>from to actually reform someone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much effort does it take?</v>

857
00:33:39.081 --> 00:33:43.190
<v Speaker 3>And individual cases are different and</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people really are just habitual</v>

858
00:33:43.191 --> 00:33:44.810
<v Speaker 3>criminals and there's nothing you can do</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

859
00:33:44.811 --> 00:33:48.980
<v Speaker 3>And if you do release them and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>continue to do a crime or they hurt</v>

860
00:33:48.981 --> 00:33:53.150
<v Speaker 3>somebody that they didn't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like where does the burden lie there?</v>

861
00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.050
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

862
00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:56.580
<v Speaker 3>I think Norway I believe is the country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

863
00:33:56.581 --> 00:33:59.480
<v Speaker 3>when I have to look it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the longest prison prison sentences</v>

864
00:33:59.481 --> 00:34:03.680
<v Speaker 3>you can get is 20 years prisoners live</v>
<v Speaker 3>in like one bedroom apartments.</v>

865
00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:04.341
<v Speaker 3>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

866
00:34:04.341 --> 00:34:05.510
<v Speaker 3>they have tv,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have.</v>

867
00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:07.410
<v Speaker 3>And the whole thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is San Quentin has,</v>

868
00:34:07.411 --> 00:34:08.750
<v Speaker 3>is to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's rehab programs.</v>

869
00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:12.200
<v Speaker 3>I talked to inmates who said that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then after 20 years in Norway,</v>

870
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:14.330
<v Speaker 3>they talk to you and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you ready to go back outside?</v>

871
00:34:14.331 --> 00:34:15.860
<v Speaker 3>Like they don't let you out</v>
<v Speaker 3>automatically,</v>

872
00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:17.300
<v Speaker 3>but they sort of checked back in with</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

873
00:34:17.301 --> 00:34:19.820
<v Speaker 3>And so if you're not like the guy who</v>
<v Speaker 3>shot up the,</v>

874
00:34:19.821 --> 00:34:21.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those people in Norway,</v>

875
00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:24.050
<v Speaker 3>he's not going to get out again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the whole idea is that</v>

876
00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:28.550
<v Speaker 3>small percentage of prisoners serve more</v>
<v Speaker 3>than 14 years.</v>

877
00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:29.630
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

878
00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.090
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're in there like,</v>

879
00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:32.900
<v Speaker 3>like in San Quintin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

880
00:34:32.901 --> 00:34:35.390
<v Speaker 3>I talked to inmates who said in most</v>
<v Speaker 3>California prisons,</v>

881
00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:40.540
<v Speaker 3>the rehab programs are aaa and Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's all they have is Jesus.</v>

882
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:42.170
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

883
00:34:42.171 --> 00:34:43.750
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

884
00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:47.780
<v Speaker 3>just a pathway to Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in San Quintin there's a newspaper,</v>

885
00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:48.890
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

886
00:34:48.891 --> 00:34:51.410
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a restorative justice programs,</v>

887
00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:52.371
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

888
00:34:52.371 --> 00:34:54.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a plate that you can learn how</v>

889
00:34:54.591 --> 00:34:55.220
<v Speaker 3>to code.</v>

890
00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:57.380
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a prisoners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We learn how to code right now so that</v>

891
00:34:57.381 --> 00:34:59.240
<v Speaker 3>when you come out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a sense of like I have.</v>

892
00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:00.830
<v Speaker 3>So there's lots of other programs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't even think of it,</v>

893
00:35:00.831 --> 00:35:03.520
<v Speaker 3>but there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is yoga in St Clinton because of</v>

894
00:35:03.521 --> 00:35:06.040
<v Speaker 3>the bay area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there's all these things in the</v>

895
00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:09.260
<v Speaker 3>so that when you come out you are a more</v>
<v Speaker 3>fully formed human being so that you</v>

896
00:35:09.261 --> 00:35:10.670
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have job skills,</v>

897
00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:12.320
<v Speaker 3>you've done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've done restorative justice</v>

898
00:35:12.321 --> 00:35:14.540
<v Speaker 3>programs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've helped other inmates who came in</v>

899
00:35:14.541 --> 00:35:16.820
<v Speaker 3>to do restorative justice programs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you come out,</v>

900
00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:19.670
<v Speaker 3>it's not that it's easy to get to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>paroled from prison,</v>

901
00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:21.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you come out you're more</v>

902
00:35:21.471 --> 00:35:24.410
<v Speaker 3>prepared for the world as opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys in other prisons in California who</v>

903
00:35:24.411 --> 00:35:27.410
<v Speaker 3>get out who have just been like doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>rehab in Jesus and have no way to</v>

904
00:35:27.411 --> 00:35:28.160
<v Speaker 3>interact with the world.</v>

905
00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just feel like they'd just been</v>

906
00:35:29.571 --> 00:35:33.020
<v Speaker 3>punished,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like being isolated and locked in a</v>

907
00:35:33.021 --> 00:35:34.640
<v Speaker 3>cage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a lot of those guys say they go</v>

908
00:35:34.641 --> 00:35:36.290
<v Speaker 3>in there for one crime that's not a big</v>
<v Speaker 3>deal.</v>

909
00:35:36.291 --> 00:35:39.540
<v Speaker 3>And he learned how to be in bed or</v>
<v Speaker 3>criminals in prison because you have to</v>

910
00:35:39.541 --> 00:35:41.880
<v Speaker 3>sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>California has like levels of prison.</v>

911
00:35:41.881 --> 00:35:44.700
<v Speaker 3>I think level four is the worst and like</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe a level five.</v>

912
00:35:44.701 --> 00:35:47.160
<v Speaker 3>But anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So everybody sort of starts out at a</v>

913
00:35:47.161 --> 00:35:49.780
<v Speaker 3>level four.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you like are in prison in</v>

914
00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.120
<v Speaker 3>California for something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

915
00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:52.500
<v Speaker 3>shooting a gun in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're at a level,</v>

916
00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:56.640
<v Speaker 3>you're there with murderers and then you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to survive that and hopefully</v>

917
00:35:56.641 --> 00:35:58.740
<v Speaker 3>graduate to San Quintin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you're in there with murderers</v>

918
00:35:58.741 --> 00:36:01.290
<v Speaker 3>you have to survive that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so a lot of guys become bigger,</v>

919
00:36:01.291 --> 00:36:03.260
<v Speaker 3>better criminals because they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>surrounded by car,</v>

920
00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:07.050
<v Speaker 3>by bigger badder criminal just to put on</v>
<v Speaker 3>armor to protect yourself just to get</v>

921
00:36:07.051 --> 00:36:07.620
<v Speaker 3>through the day.</v>

922
00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:09.510
<v Speaker 3>And so to me like the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

923
00:36:09.511 --> 00:36:10.051
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

924
00:36:10.051 --> 00:36:12.000
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know and there's a lot of money</v>

925
00:36:12.001 --> 00:36:13.590
<v Speaker 3>that's already in prisons that's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>being used.</v>

926
00:36:13.591 --> 00:36:18.180
<v Speaker 3>Well the prison private prison system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we're selling private companies are</v>

927
00:36:18.181 --> 00:36:21.420
<v Speaker 3>selling like they have to keep the</v>
<v Speaker 3>prisons full because they're running a</v>

928
00:36:21.421 --> 00:36:24.690
<v Speaker 3>prison for profit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it becomes less about like,</v>

929
00:36:24.691 --> 00:36:26.510
<v Speaker 3>it's like we need to keep the beds full,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

930
00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:29.910
<v Speaker 3>it's not about like Rehab and</v>
<v Speaker 3>rehabilitations about we need to keep</v>

931
00:36:29.911 --> 00:36:32.670
<v Speaker 3>the beds full because we are running,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are a corporation running for profit.</v>

932
00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:35.690
<v Speaker 3>That's where it gets dark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck did anybody ever improved</v>

933
00:36:35.691 --> 00:36:39.610
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is so scary to someone.</v>

934
00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:43.380
<v Speaker 3>It's basically they're using humans as</v>
<v Speaker 3>like cells and a battery,</v>

935
00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:46.110
<v Speaker 3>like a giant battery that generates</v>
<v Speaker 3>income.</v>

936
00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:47.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly,</v>

937
00:36:47.251 --> 00:36:50.910
<v Speaker 3>and that the prisoner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the goal is not to turn these guys</v>

938
00:36:50.911 --> 00:36:52.740
<v Speaker 3>into better citizen citizens.</v>

939
00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.490
<v Speaker 3>The goal is to keep the the men and</v>
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>

940
00:36:54.491 --> 00:36:55.860
<v Speaker 3>but the goal is to keep the prisons</v>
<v Speaker 3>filled.</v>

941
00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.510
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's absolutely been proven by prison</v>

942
00:36:57.511 --> 00:37:01.020
<v Speaker 3>guard unions trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They mean they lobby against marijuana</v>

943
00:37:01.021 --> 00:37:05.280
<v Speaker 3>legalization of marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is probably the one thing that's</v>

944
00:37:05.281 --> 00:37:07.050
<v Speaker 3>going to stop people from committing</v>
<v Speaker 3>crimes.</v>

945
00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:08.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're talking about violent</v>

946
00:37:08.821 --> 00:37:10.770
<v Speaker 3>crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there is a drug that's going to stop</v>

947
00:37:10.771 --> 00:37:12.870
<v Speaker 3>you from doing a violent crime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that might be it,</v>

948
00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:16.590
<v Speaker 3>but at least maybe like less than the</v>
<v Speaker 3>chances.</v>

949
00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:19.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I should sit down and just chill</v>

950
00:37:19.831 --> 00:37:21.540
<v Speaker 3>out for a second before I go do that</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

951
00:37:21.541 --> 00:37:23.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no other reason to lobby against</v>

952
00:37:23.371 --> 00:37:25.950
<v Speaker 3>it that you want to keep your job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to make sure that you have</v>

953
00:37:25.951 --> 00:37:29.100
<v Speaker 3>plenty of jobs that people in your union</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the and those,</v>

954
00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:32.820
<v Speaker 3>and there's many of those people who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>in prison for nonviolent drug offenses</v>

955
00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:35.700
<v Speaker 3>like marijuana and other things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are the next to next to murderers,</v>

956
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:37.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to figure out how to</v>

957
00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:39.530
<v Speaker 3>navigate through that and they're.</v>

958
00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:41.910
<v Speaker 3>And if you're not in San Quintin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not,</v>

959
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.640
<v Speaker 3>you're not in a place where you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>learn other skills.</v>

960
00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:45.241
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

961
00:37:45.241 --> 00:37:47.670
<v Speaker 3>again guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't Clinton getting college diplomas,</v>

962
00:37:47.671 --> 00:37:49.470
<v Speaker 3>getting like all sorts of certificates</v>
<v Speaker 3>and things,</v>

963
00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.350
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that nobody then wants to release</v>

964
00:37:52.351 --> 00:37:54.840
<v Speaker 3>them from prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That chance nobody will.</v>

965
00:37:54.841 --> 00:37:57.240
<v Speaker 3>Nobody wants to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No politician goes,</v>

966
00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.330
<v Speaker 3>I have released more inmates from</v>
<v Speaker 3>Britain.</v>

967
00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:02.820
<v Speaker 3>He</v>
<v Speaker 3>takes his one.</v>

968
00:38:02.821 --> 00:38:03.750
<v Speaker 3>Willie Horton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

969
00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:04.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which we,</v>

970
00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:05.541
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was like,</v>

971
00:38:05.541 --> 00:38:06.361
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're again,</v>

972
00:38:06.361 --> 00:38:09.660
<v Speaker 3>we're demonizing one case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing with Berkeley.</v>

973
00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:12.990
<v Speaker 3>There's a picture that was on the San</v>
<v Speaker 3>Francisco Chronicle of an ever</v>

974
00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.390
<v Speaker 3>antifungals antifa black bucket because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

975
00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:19.350
<v Speaker 3>like with a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with like a like a gas bomb it and</v>

976
00:38:19.351 --> 00:38:24.351
<v Speaker 3>surrounding that person is journalists</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking pictures of him so that that</v>

977
00:38:24.751 --> 00:38:26.820
<v Speaker 3>becomes the face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they're not surrounded by</v>

978
00:38:26.821 --> 00:38:29.320
<v Speaker 3>other black black people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like all the journals are going.</v>

979
00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:32.580
<v Speaker 3>That's where the picture is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not like the people who were like,</v>

980
00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:36.070
<v Speaker 3>I was on a on a truck with clergy</v>
<v Speaker 3>singing like spirituals.</v>

981
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:37.720
<v Speaker 2>Nobody took pictures of that and put it</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the news.</v>

982
00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:39.730
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

984
00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the local public radio station,</v>

985
00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:44.170
<v Speaker 2>because I'm a celebrity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in the back of the truck.</v>

986
00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.250
<v Speaker 2>Well anytime there's like some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>gathering,</v>

987
00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:51.610
<v Speaker 2>you're always gonna have people in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>gathering that act out,</v>

988
00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:55.840
<v Speaker 2>try to get more attention than they</v>
<v Speaker 2>deserve or that get caught up in the</v>

989
00:38:55.841 --> 00:38:59.250
<v Speaker 2>whole group movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's always this sort of like</v>

990
00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:04.800
<v Speaker 2>gigantic mass of people that will cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>people to behave.</v>

991
00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:09.160
<v Speaker 2>Some people to behave in a way that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>uncharacteristic or.</v>

992
00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:12.720
<v Speaker 2>And I mean there's just that mob</v>
<v Speaker 2>mentality.</v>

993
00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:14.710
<v Speaker 2>I a real thing that happens is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

994
00:39:14.711 --> 00:39:17.810
<v Speaker 2>rock concerts or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

995
00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:19.840
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mentalities 100 percent real.</v>

996
00:39:19.841 --> 00:39:22.030
<v Speaker 2>You can feel it in the air when Shit's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going sideways.</v>

997
00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:24.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've been in clubs where it's</v>

998
00:39:24.461 --> 00:39:25.294
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

999
00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:27.150
<v Speaker 2>something happens like a heckler or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1000
00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.780
<v Speaker 2>That's the energy changes and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>that moment of like,</v>

1001
00:39:28.781 --> 00:39:29.680
<v Speaker 2>what's about to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1002
00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:31.990
<v Speaker 2>it feels like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you also been in that position.</v>

1003
00:39:31.991 --> 00:39:34.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you have where you feel like I</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a lot of power in this moment.</v>

1004
00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:38.290
<v Speaker 2>Like I could if I said</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if I go,</v>

1005
00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:42.160
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you say you certainly,</v>

1006
00:39:42.161 --> 00:39:43.650
<v Speaker 2>if you said get them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people would get it.</v>

1007
00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:46.270
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I said get them,</v>

1008
00:39:46.271 --> 00:39:48.160
<v Speaker 2>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will write my congressman.</v>

1009
00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.390
<v Speaker 2>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should start a petition.</v>

1010
00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:54.540
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's real.</v>

1011
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:57.280
<v Speaker 2>That's all you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the thing is that everybody</v>

1012
00:39:57.281 --> 00:39:58.990
<v Speaker 2>responds differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing that happened,</v>

1013
00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:03.040
<v Speaker 2>I'll say specifically in Berkeley was</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's a sense that these people</v>

1014
00:40:03.041 --> 00:40:06.790
<v Speaker 2>brought violence to Berkeley the last</v>
<v Speaker 2>few times they came and people respond</v>

1015
00:40:06.791 --> 00:40:09.530
<v Speaker 2>differently to threats of violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people respond with the nonviolent</v>

1016
00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:10.450
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people respond to,</v>

1017
00:40:10.451 --> 00:40:12.850
<v Speaker 2>I won't go to the park that day and some</v>
<v Speaker 2>people respond with,</v>

1018
00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:14.080
<v Speaker 2>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring it.</v>

1019
00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you think there's also a real</v>

1020
00:40:16.001 --> 00:40:19.750
<v Speaker 2>issue in you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you got to find out what his</v>

1021
00:40:19.751 --> 00:40:24.751
<v Speaker 2>actual hate speech and what is like</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone like Ben Shapiro who I think is</v>

1022
00:40:25.451 --> 00:40:29.320
<v Speaker 2>just a conservative guy who's very</v>
<v Speaker 2>articulate and doesn't promote hate at</v>

1023
00:40:29.321 --> 00:40:32.590
<v Speaker 2>all and he's extremely reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of people that equate</v>

1024
00:40:32.591 --> 00:40:35.500
<v Speaker 2>him even though he's an Orthodox Jew and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people equate him with being a</v>

1025
00:40:35.501 --> 00:40:38.170
<v Speaker 2>Nazi and they try to silence him from</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking.</v>

1026
00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:42.010
<v Speaker 2>Like when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it becomes a giant issue and I</v>

1027
00:40:42.011 --> 00:40:45.190
<v Speaker 2>think he got to let people talk and if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you disagree with people,</v>

1028
00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:48.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean as long as they're not out there</v>
<v Speaker 2>promoting violence or promoting</v>

1029
00:40:48.191 --> 00:40:53.191
<v Speaker 2>negativity or promoting some sort of a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that it's a portrait,</v>

1030
00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:56.440
<v Speaker 2>but if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you let someone talk and then if you</v>

1031
00:40:56.441 --> 00:40:58.750
<v Speaker 2>have someone that disagrees with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a debate.</v>

1032
00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:01.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the Baden have everybody be</v>

1033
00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:03.010
<v Speaker 2>peaceful and civil with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1034
00:41:03.011 --> 00:41:04.540
<v Speaker 2>I think the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the,</v>

1035
00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:06.760
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that line of what hate speech is,</v>

1036
00:41:06.761 --> 00:41:08.220
<v Speaker 2>and I just talked to somebody from acl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

1037
00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my other podcasts about,</v>

1038
00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:12.670

1039
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:14.010
<v Speaker 2>Politically reactive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1040
00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:15.130
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a podcast with my friend,</v>

1041
00:41:15.131 --> 00:41:17.800
<v Speaker 2>Hari Kondabolu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's a weekly talk about politics?</v>

1042
00:41:17.801 --> 00:41:20.140
<v Speaker 2>We were going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We started it right before the election,</v>

1043
00:41:20.141 --> 00:41:22.720
<v Speaker 2>like we'll do this political podcast and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary will win.</v>

1044
00:41:22.721 --> 00:41:26.860
<v Speaker 2>They will go about our business</v>
<v Speaker 2>is huge.</v>

1045
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:28.670
<v Speaker 2>Hillary supporter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that was a figure.</v>

1046
00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:30.610
<v Speaker 2>That was the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were offered do it up until the</v>

1047
00:41:30.611 --> 00:41:31.690
<v Speaker 2>election and then it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1048
00:41:31.691 --> 00:41:33.740
<v Speaker 2>I guess we're doing this for maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>forever,</v>

1049
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.590
<v Speaker 3>maybe through the end of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he becomes like Putin.</v>

1050
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:37.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exact.</v>

1051
00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:37.641
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1052
00:41:37.641 --> 00:41:38.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the real fear,</v>

1053
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:41.360
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although then I guess I stay employed.</v>

1054
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:43.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just rock was onstage right after the</v>

1055
00:41:43.431 --> 00:41:43.941
<v Speaker 3>election.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1056
00:41:43.941 --> 00:41:45.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's never getting out of there,</v>

1057
00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:47.540
<v Speaker 3>you know that right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be there forever.</v>

1058
00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:49.790
<v Speaker 3>He scared the shit out of me because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>never thought about that.</v>

1059
00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.073
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1060
00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:54.110
<v Speaker 3>Bloomberg stayed in New York an extra</v>
<v Speaker 3>term just because he wanted to,</v>

1061
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:55.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>New York governor's.</v>

1062
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:56.421
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>New York.</v>

1063
00:41:56.421 --> 00:41:57.860
<v Speaker 3>Mayor's is supposed to be two terms and</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1064
00:41:57.861 --> 00:41:58.694
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

1065
00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:00.610
<v Speaker 3>I forgot who it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was like he was like,</v>

1066
00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:03.860
<v Speaker 3>I think I understand other one and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>let him know that I didn't live in New</v>

1067
00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:05.180
<v Speaker 3>York at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't know how it all went down.</v>

1068
00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:07.460
<v Speaker 3>Did they change the law?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he changed the law.</v>

1069
00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:09.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you changed permanently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah.</v>

1070
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:11.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if there is a precedence for this is</v>

1071
00:42:11.331 --> 00:42:14.450
<v Speaker 3>all I'm saying there's a precedence for</v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of like the country needs me</v>

1072
00:42:14.451 --> 00:42:15.740
<v Speaker 3>because it's so divided.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1073
00:42:15.741 --> 00:42:17.000
<v Speaker 3>Motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you divide a bit.</v>

1074
00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:21.320
<v Speaker 3>Like this is how the game works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I would say the thing about Ben</v>

1075
00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:21.740
<v Speaker 3>Shapiro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't,</v>

1076
00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:23.690
<v Speaker 3>I've only seen a little bit of his work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I certainly,</v>

1077
00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:28.460
<v Speaker 3>I know there are people on that side who</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an ideological argument and</v>

1078
00:42:28.461 --> 00:42:31.130
<v Speaker 3>ideological arguments sometimes can be</v>
<v Speaker 3>filled with hate.</v>

1079
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:32.750
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know Ben Shapiro.</v>

1080
00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:34.430
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's sometimes it's like,</v>

1081
00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:35.091
<v Speaker 3>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

1082
00:42:35.091 --> 00:42:38.510
<v Speaker 3>you're just making ideological argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it ends with me having to move out</v>

1083
00:42:38.511 --> 00:42:39.321
<v Speaker 3>of America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1084
00:42:39.321 --> 00:42:42.830
<v Speaker 3>so that's what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm saying so,</v>

1085
00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:45.640
<v Speaker 3>but some people make these articles.</v>

1086
00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:48.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is,</v>

1087
00:42:48.071 --> 00:42:52.180
<v Speaker 3>is that now there's a whole movement</v>
<v Speaker 3>associated with things that maybe ben</v>

1088
00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:54.710
<v Speaker 3>looks to be a part of so that if he</v>
<v Speaker 3>shows up,</v>

1089
00:42:54.711 --> 00:42:56.810
<v Speaker 3>people don't know and don't know that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not.</v>

1090
00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:59.090
<v Speaker 3>That he shows up going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not bringing violence,</v>

1091
00:42:59.091 --> 00:43:01.430
<v Speaker 3>but they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vape may be violent traveling around</v>

1092
00:43:01.431 --> 00:43:02.600
<v Speaker 3>with him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not him,</v>

1093
00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:06.110
<v Speaker 3>but there are others like him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a war less,</v>

1094
00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:08.210
<v Speaker 3>less reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like all right,</v>

1095
00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:10.990
<v Speaker 3>like whatever the fuck alt right is I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a problem.</v>

1096
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.360
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1097
00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:17.600
<v Speaker 3>And what does that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean people that are on that that are</v>

1098
00:43:17.601 --> 00:43:22.550
<v Speaker 3>violent and there's people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>considered themselves antifascist that</v>

1099
00:43:22.551 --> 00:43:26.780
<v Speaker 3>are extremely peaceful and they would</v>
<v Speaker 3>say that they're anti for the real</v>

1100
00:43:26.781 --> 00:43:28.970
<v Speaker 3>antifa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then what is black block?</v>

1101
00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:30.630
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's no granicus.</v>

1102
00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:32.090
<v Speaker 3>I think it's probably a bay area.</v>

1103
00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:33.570
<v Speaker 3>How long has that been going?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been going.</v>

1104
00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:35.870
<v Speaker 3>I think if we're going on a while,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know,</v>

1105
00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:36.650
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1106
00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:38.810
<v Speaker 3>but it's a thing that like whenever we</v>
<v Speaker 3>would see.</v>

1107
00:43:38.811 --> 00:43:40.850
<v Speaker 3>I think now we're calling it an Antifa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like there would be.</v>

1108
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean this happened the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were some black lives matter</v>

1109
00:43:43.041 --> 00:43:46.010
<v Speaker 3>protests in Berkeley and some black</v>
<v Speaker 3>bloc.</v>

1110
00:43:46.011 --> 00:43:47.660
<v Speaker 3>Anika.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's described the same way.</v>

1111
00:43:47.661 --> 00:43:50.060
<v Speaker 3>We're in black all covered up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were like.</v>

1112
00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:51.760
<v Speaker 3>And these people showed up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't know if they were in teeth,</v>

1113
00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:52.371
<v Speaker 3>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great,</v>

1114
00:43:52.371 --> 00:43:55.250
<v Speaker 3>now we can loot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people stood in front of stores</v>

1115
00:43:55.251 --> 00:43:55.641
<v Speaker 3>going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1116
00:43:55.641 --> 00:43:55.971
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1117
00:43:55.971 --> 00:43:57.620
<v Speaker 3>we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not doing that.</v>

1118
00:43:57.650 --> 00:43:58.580
<v Speaker 3>We're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not doing.</v>

1119
00:43:58.581 --> 00:44:01.580
<v Speaker 3>That had nothing to do with you getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the verizon store,</v>

1120
00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:05.630
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing to do with you ransacking this a</v>

1121
00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:09.530
<v Speaker 3>radio shack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw some of the Antifa people trying</v>

1122
00:44:09.531 --> 00:44:10.160
<v Speaker 3>to stop.</v>

1123
00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:12.980
<v Speaker 3>One of the other Antifa people from</v>
<v Speaker 3>beating up a trump supporter.</v>

1124
00:44:12.981 --> 00:44:15.770
<v Speaker 3>They had this guy down and that was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>journalist Al Letson.</v>

1125
00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:16.371
<v Speaker 3>That's A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1126
00:44:16.371 --> 00:44:18.980
<v Speaker 3>he's a bay area journalists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has the podcast reveal and he's the</v>

1127
00:44:18.981 --> 00:44:20.150
<v Speaker 3>guy that tried to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got.</v>

1128
00:44:20.151 --> 00:44:20.984
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Black Guy.</v>

1129
00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:22.700
<v Speaker 3>Black Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Waited through the white people.</v>

1130
00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:24.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's white people that I saw doing it</v>

1131
00:44:24.381 --> 00:44:26.180
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it must have been like sort of a</v>

1132
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:27.850
<v Speaker 3>must,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but certainly it happened more than.</v>

1133
00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:29.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certainly there are people who are like,</v>

1134
00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.500
<v Speaker 3>there's tea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's people who support it because</v>

1135
00:44:32.501 --> 00:44:34.650
<v Speaker 3>they feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we need somebody who stands up to</v>

1136
00:44:34.651 --> 00:44:36.270
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's not people who support</v>

1137
00:44:36.271 --> 00:44:38.600
<v Speaker 3>people beating people up randomly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1138
00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:40.500
<v Speaker 3>so yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were outlets in and other people</v>

1139
00:44:40.501 --> 00:44:41.460
<v Speaker 3>stepped into like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1140
00:44:41.461 --> 00:44:43.530
<v Speaker 3>we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing about the Berkeley and the</v>

1141
00:44:43.531 --> 00:44:47.730
<v Speaker 3>berries that people don't get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think it's all one thing like that.</v>

1142
00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:49.800
<v Speaker 3>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sort of like left d,</v>

1143
00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:51.540
<v Speaker 3>like socialist blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah blah.</v>

1144
00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:54.780
<v Speaker 3>And the thing about Berkeley's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not that the is not that it's a lot</v>

1145
00:44:54.781 --> 00:44:57.780
<v Speaker 3>of different people who feel like who</v>
<v Speaker 3>are on some version of the left,</v>

1146
00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:00.690
<v Speaker 3>but they don't necessarily agree with</v>
<v Speaker 3>each other and they let a lot of shit</v>

1147
00:45:00.691 --> 00:45:02.260
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's not like the,</v>

1148
00:45:02.261 --> 00:45:04.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that can be the naked guy who walked</v>

1149
00:45:04.321 --> 00:45:06.720
<v Speaker 3>through town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that doesn't mean we all support</v>

1150
00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:07.920
<v Speaker 3>people walk around naked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we're like,</v>

1151
00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:09.170
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was me.</v>

1152
00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:12.280
<v Speaker 3>But it also means that like during</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama's reign in the bay,</v>

1153
00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:14.880
<v Speaker 3>I lived in San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were libertarian setup on corners</v>

1154
00:45:14.881 --> 00:45:17.230
<v Speaker 3>with Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big huge pictures of Obama and with a</v>

1155
00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:20.160
<v Speaker 3>Hitler mustache has painted on him and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all like,</v>

1156
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:23.700
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as you're not,</v>

1157
00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:25.140
<v Speaker 3>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to start a fight.</v>

1158
00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:26.610
<v Speaker 3>Well you do your thing man.</v>

1159
00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:30.300
<v Speaker 3>And that's what people don't get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who have put this whole lefty sort of</v>

1160
00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:33.570
<v Speaker 3>whatever lived hard thing on Berkeley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not one thing.</v>

1161
00:45:33.571 --> 00:45:35.730
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's where it's a lot of things that the</v>

1162
00:45:35.731 --> 00:45:37.680
<v Speaker 3>berries is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's where all the freaks sort of end up</v>

1163
00:45:37.681 --> 00:45:39.600
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't feel in my life that I'm</v>

1164
00:45:39.601 --> 00:45:42.170
<v Speaker 3>understood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we don't agree with each other thing</v>

1165
00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:44.070
<v Speaker 3>that we sort of all agree on is that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can.</v>

1166
00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:47.180
<v Speaker 3>So if the alt right wanted to show up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1167
00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:49.170
<v Speaker 3>conservative people come speak at</v>
<v Speaker 3>Berkeley all the time.</v>

1168
00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:52.560
<v Speaker 3>It's specifically around people who look</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they're bringing violence or</v>

1169
00:45:52.561 --> 00:45:54.690
<v Speaker 3>bringing targeting people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>

1170
00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:56.130
<v Speaker 3>The Berkeley,</v>
<v Speaker 3>UC Berkeley,</v>

1171
00:45:56.730 --> 00:46:00.030
<v Speaker 3>one of the professors I think of law</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is named John you a why?</v>

1172
00:46:00.031 --> 00:46:02.370
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wrote the Bush torture memos.</v>

1173
00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:05.520
<v Speaker 3>He's a professor at UC Berkeley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's like,</v>

1174
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:07.950
<v Speaker 3>we got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess he's a good professor.</v>

1175
00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:10.500
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does the professor in a law,</v>

1176
00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:13.050
<v Speaker 3>he's a law professor and he's been there</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a long time and he's.</v>

1177
00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:14.910
<v Speaker 3>He wrote the Bush torture memos that</v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

1178
00:46:14.911 --> 00:46:16.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you do some waterboarding,</v>

1179
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:19.470
<v Speaker 3>this is not a direct quote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he wrote memos.</v>

1180
00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:22.170
<v Speaker 3>It said like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sort of outline how to do enhanced</v>

1181
00:46:22.171 --> 00:46:24.300
<v Speaker 3>interrogation techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's been there for a long time and</v>

1182
00:46:24.301 --> 00:46:25.240
<v Speaker 3>nobody thinking about him.</v>

1183
00:46:27.850 --> 00:46:28.710
<v Speaker 3>Go get him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody.</v>

1184
00:46:28.711 --> 00:46:29.544
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>

1185
00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:33.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never met him,</v>

1186
00:46:33.181 --> 00:46:36.900
<v Speaker 3>I've never socialized with him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's there and also I'm the dude who</v>

1187
00:46:36.901 --> 00:46:40.430
<v Speaker 3>was a deep in the Clinton White House,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a kitten he was named,</v>

1188
00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:41.010
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's.</v>

1189
00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:43.830
<v Speaker 3>It was also at Berkeley,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's not some sort of lefty</v>

1190
00:46:43.831 --> 00:46:45.420
<v Speaker 3>version of Berkeley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is one thing.</v>

1191
00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:47.940
<v Speaker 3>It's a lots of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The free speech thing is true.</v>

1192
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:50.760
<v Speaker 3>The thing that people are nervous about</v>
<v Speaker 3>is violence.</v>

1193
00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:52.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that,</v>

1194
00:46:52.111 --> 00:46:54.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ann coulter can come speak at Berkeley</v>

1195
00:46:54.391 --> 00:46:55.420
<v Speaker 3>anytime she wants to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the.</v>

1196
00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:57.530
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's this thing about like there's</v>

1197
00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:58.320
<v Speaker 3>not going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going,</v>

1198
00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:02.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to encourage violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the issue with Ann Coulter,</v>

1199
00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:06.660
<v Speaker 3>I think Ann Coulter is and opportunists</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they think that what she does is try</v>

1200
00:47:06.661 --> 00:47:09.900
<v Speaker 3>to inflame people so that she can sell</v>
<v Speaker 3>books and stay relevant.</v>

1201
00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:10.520
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1202
00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:12.300
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's actually going after the market</v>

1203
00:47:12.301 --> 00:47:14.300
<v Speaker 3>like we were talking about earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She saw this market out there.</v>

1204
00:47:14.301 --> 00:47:15.150
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1205
00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:16.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm a pretty blonde lady.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could,</v>

1206
00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:18.780
<v Speaker 3>I could probably sell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a what?</v>

1207
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:21.450
<v Speaker 3>I think that's how she's been at some</v>
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>

1208
00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:23.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm a black guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't see what are you seeing</v>

1209
00:47:25.450 --> 00:47:30.430
<v Speaker 3>glasses you try them on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like early in her career she was</v>

1210
00:47:30.431 --> 00:47:33.520
<v Speaker 3>marketed that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to say I'm not trying to.</v>

1211
00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:35.780
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of those out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think she's one of them.</v>

1212
00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:37.810
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then I'll let you be the expert,</v>

1213
00:47:37.811 --> 00:47:38.770
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please do.</v>

1214
00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:42.190
<v Speaker 3>But I'm just saying I'm A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a blonde lady.</v>

1215
00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:42.841
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1216
00:47:42.841 --> 00:47:44.650
<v Speaker 3>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then there's a lot of that.</v>

1217
00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:47.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That it's like that in this package,</v>

1218
00:47:47.141 --> 00:47:49.270
<v Speaker 3>this becomes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same way that like his comics,</v>

1219
00:47:49.271 --> 00:47:49.661
<v Speaker 3>he go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1220
00:47:49.661 --> 00:47:51.170
<v Speaker 3>you're the guy who does this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1221
00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:52.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she's doing it dot.</v>

1222
00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:55.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's people that do that</v>
<v Speaker 3>online that they,</v>

1223
00:47:55.310 --> 00:47:57.370
<v Speaker 3>they're saying things that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>inflammatory.</v>

1224
00:47:57.371 --> 00:47:58.930
<v Speaker 3>They're saying things they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know,</v>

1225
00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:02.650
<v Speaker 3>don't necessarily fear of being</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely objective and reasonable.</v>

1226
00:48:02.651 --> 00:48:05.120
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't say that you're only</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying it because they think it's going</v>

1227
00:48:05.121 --> 00:48:07.300
<v Speaker 3>to get a reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why her and Bill Margaret along</v>

1228
00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:08.650
<v Speaker 3>together because they're both doing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same thing.</v>

1229
00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:11.890
<v Speaker 3>I can't deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't have enough time.</v>

1230
00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:14.800
<v Speaker 3>Not enough time in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should get attention for what you</v>

1231
00:48:14.801 --> 00:48:18.700
<v Speaker 3>deserve attention for and if you want</v>
<v Speaker 3>attention by being provocative</v>

1232
00:48:18.701 --> 00:48:20.560
<v Speaker 3>intentionally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you're funny.</v>

1233
00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:22.590
<v Speaker 3>That's common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the nature of comedy.</v>

1234
00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:24.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1235
00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:24.551
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1236
00:48:24.551 --> 00:48:26.230
<v Speaker 3>it's absolutely true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she thinks she's funny,</v>

1237
00:48:26.231 --> 00:48:29.080
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Berkeley has had conservative</v>

1238
00:48:29.081 --> 00:48:30.760
<v Speaker 3>speaker speak there throughout the</v>
<v Speaker 3>history of Berkeley.</v>

1239
00:48:30.761 --> 00:48:31.600
<v Speaker 3>It's not about that.</v>

1240
00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:33.400
<v Speaker 3>It's a big history is different than the</v>
<v Speaker 3>current.</v>

1241
00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:37.810
<v Speaker 3>The current thing is because when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when Milo was going to show up,</v>

1242
00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:39.280
<v Speaker 3>he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a,</v>

1243
00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:42.040
<v Speaker 3>there was the fear and he'd seen it</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen before where he was targeting</v>

1244
00:48:42.041 --> 00:48:43.600
<v Speaker 3>students,</v>
<v Speaker 3>either undocumented students.</v>

1245
00:48:43.601 --> 00:48:47.560
<v Speaker 3>He like naming students during his stage</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing who are undocumented or trans,</v>

1246
00:48:47.561 --> 00:48:50.410
<v Speaker 3>and there was fear that like we that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>promoting violence.</v>

1247
00:48:50.411 --> 00:48:52.450
<v Speaker 3>That's documented thing is a huge issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1248
00:48:52.530 --> 00:48:53.410
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not,</v>

1249
00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:57.550
<v Speaker 3>that's specified specifically targeting</v>
<v Speaker 3>individuals that and that thing is</v>

1250
00:48:57.551 --> 00:48:59.080
<v Speaker 3>Berkeley is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't stand for that.</v>

1251
00:48:59.110 --> 00:49:01.600
<v Speaker 3>That's not about free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's about safety and I feel like</v>

1252
00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:03.800
<v Speaker 3>that's where the word is hate speech</v>
<v Speaker 3>began.</v>

1253
00:49:03.830 --> 00:49:06.730
<v Speaker 3>Where does free speech begin?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where it's a huge market area that even</v>

1254
00:49:06.731 --> 00:49:09.700
<v Speaker 3>the law can't tell you where it is and</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1255
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:13.570
<v Speaker 3>but those issues of what is free speech</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what isn't free speech or freedom of</v>

1256
00:49:13.571 --> 00:49:14.420
<v Speaker 3>expression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1257
00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:15.760
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the bay area I live right next to</v>

1258
00:49:15.761 --> 00:49:16.240
<v Speaker 3>Oakland.</v>

1259
00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:18.820
<v Speaker 3>Black Panthers were in Oakland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>California used to be an open carry</v>

1260
00:49:18.821 --> 00:49:20.890
<v Speaker 3>state until the black panthers like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh it is.</v>

1261
00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:26.840
<v Speaker 3>They went to Sacramento when Reagan was</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and like openly caring and people</v>

1262
00:49:26.841 --> 00:49:28.120
<v Speaker 3>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1263
00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:31.960
<v Speaker 3>this open carries not such a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not really a debate right now.</v>

1264
00:49:31.961 --> 00:49:35.280
<v Speaker 3>In charlottesville though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't letting it slide.</v>

1265
00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:38.440
<v Speaker 3>So it's about who's in power and what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they wanted to let you get away with</v>

1266
00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:40.180
<v Speaker 3>Charlottesville.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Open carry men.</v>

1267
00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:41.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Must Be.</v>

1268
00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:43.420
<v Speaker 3>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>

1269
00:49:43.421 --> 00:49:44.490
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's definitely that.</v>

1270
00:49:44.491 --> 00:49:45.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1271
00:49:45.521 --> 00:49:47.430
<v Speaker 3>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they picked Charlottesville for</v>

1272
00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:48.790
<v Speaker 3>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that weird though,</v>

1273
00:49:48.791 --> 00:49:50.810
<v Speaker 3>that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a liberal college will of</v>

1274
00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:52.570
<v Speaker 3>liberal art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Liberal Arts college doesn't mean it's</v>

1275
00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:54.070
<v Speaker 3>liberal college with a Liberal Arts</v>
<v Speaker 3>College,</v>

1276
00:49:54.071 --> 00:49:56.560
<v Speaker 3>a blue.in the middle of this red state</v>
<v Speaker 3>that has open carry.</v>

1277
00:49:56.561 --> 00:49:59.290
<v Speaker 3>So like there's reasons they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>targeting these places.</v>

1278
00:49:59.291 --> 00:50:02.560
<v Speaker 3>I think Berkeley up until recently set</v>
<v Speaker 3>for like a soft target because they'd</v>

1279
00:50:02.561 --> 00:50:06.550
<v Speaker 3>been there twice and whooped our assets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're like all we can just catch the</v>

1280
00:50:06.551 --> 00:50:08.680
<v Speaker 3>third fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mayweather,</v>

1281
00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:13.500
<v Speaker 3>Mcgregor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight in the octagon on arturo might</v>

1282
00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:14.290
<v Speaker 3>take it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1283
00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:16.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this third time it was like we were</v>

1284
00:50:16.001 --> 00:50:16.780
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1285
00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:19.960
<v Speaker 3>we'll Charlottesville to me was so</v>
<v Speaker 3>representative of the Times that we're</v>

1286
00:50:19.961 --> 00:50:23.500
<v Speaker 3>in because all these white guys with</v>
<v Speaker 3>citronella candles they got from home</v>

1287
00:50:23.501 --> 00:50:24.334
<v Speaker 3>depot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1288
00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:27.570
<v Speaker 3>why in the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you guys carry whole foods as</v>

1289
00:50:27.571 --> 00:50:28.404
<v Speaker 3>well?</v>

1290
00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:32.180
<v Speaker 2>Walk around with crocs on Tiki torches</v>
<v Speaker 2>are not white inventions.</v>

1291
00:50:32.181 --> 00:50:33.800
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's just the whole thing.</v>

1292
00:50:33.801 --> 00:50:35.270
<v Speaker 2>Like you had to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't even bring your own.</v>

1293
00:50:35.271 --> 00:50:37.910
<v Speaker 2>You can just bring sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had to ring Polynesian Tiki torches.</v>

1294
00:50:37.930 --> 00:50:41.240
<v Speaker 2>But the whole torch thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what the fuck are we doing?</v>

1295
00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:43.990
<v Speaker 2>Why do you have torches?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're invoking the images of,</v>

1296
00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:47.360
<v Speaker 2>of white people carrying torches that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have terrorized people of color and</v>

1297
00:50:47.361 --> 00:50:48.590
<v Speaker 2>black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's what it is.</v>

1298
00:50:48.591 --> 00:50:50.510
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no other reason torch,</v>

1299
00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:54.760
<v Speaker 2>the free speech thing is like you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>purposely invoking an image because you</v>

1300
00:50:54.761 --> 00:50:57.440
<v Speaker 2>know you could've just held your phones</v>
<v Speaker 2>up with the lights on if you want to</v>

1301
00:50:57.620 --> 00:50:59.780
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about those headlamps</v>

1302
00:50:59.781 --> 00:51:01.800
<v Speaker 2>you get when you go camping in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>woods.</v>

1303
00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:04.520
<v Speaker 2>Those are way better than those stupid</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking torture,</v>

1304
00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:05.960
<v Speaker 2>but they want to look supreme.</v>

1305
00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:08.800
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make you look supreme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What torches represented.</v>

1306
00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:11.990
<v Speaker 2>Fire and fire is very volatile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could use that fire.</v>

1307
00:51:11.991 --> 00:51:14.360
<v Speaker 2>You could light things on fire like</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're at step one.</v>

1308
00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:16.940
<v Speaker 2>Step two is we start lighting shit on</v>
<v Speaker 2>fire with this fire.</v>

1309
00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:18.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like right now we're carrying it around</v>

1310
00:51:18.501 --> 00:51:22.760
<v Speaker 2>in a controlled manner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're showing it in a way like a</v>

1311
00:51:22.761 --> 00:51:26.570
<v Speaker 2>step below open carry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're walking around with something</v>

1312
00:51:26.571 --> 00:51:30.800
<v Speaker 2>that you can use a light things on fire</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they know the history of white</v>

1313
00:51:30.801 --> 00:51:34.550
<v Speaker 2>people carrying torches as the clan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're very purposefully doing the</v>

1314
00:51:34.551 --> 00:51:35.800
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the idea that like there's</v>

1315
00:51:35.810 --> 00:51:39.470
<v Speaker 2>probably a clan members like dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where we wore the hoods so we</v>

1316
00:51:39.471 --> 00:51:41.690
<v Speaker 2>couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't want to be fired.</v>

1317
00:51:41.691 --> 00:51:45.580
<v Speaker 2>That's why we wear the Hoodie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting fired left and Ryan cold out and</v>

1318
00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:48.770
<v Speaker 2>crying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think they know that they know the</v>

1319
00:51:48.771 --> 00:51:50.920
<v Speaker 2>history of the fact that like if we show</v>
<v Speaker 2>up carrying torches,</v>

1320
00:51:50.921 --> 00:51:53.510
<v Speaker 2>it means something different than if we</v>
<v Speaker 2>show up wearing headlamps are carrying</v>

1321
00:51:53.511 --> 00:51:55.520
<v Speaker 2>our phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't even get those fucking</v>

1322
00:51:55.521 --> 00:51:58.580
<v Speaker 2>Frankenstein style torches where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>raspberry too quickly,</v>

1323
00:52:00.310 --> 00:52:01.310
<v Speaker 2>so not real.</v>

1324
00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:05.390
<v Speaker 2>They had to replenish those every 15</v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes on movie sets.</v>

1325
00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:06.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1326
00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:08.420
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those as I learned what the clan that</v>

1327
00:52:08.421 --> 00:52:09.650
<v Speaker 2>would burn too quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1328
00:52:09.651 --> 00:52:11.690
<v Speaker 2>Well that's also the thing with flaming</v>
<v Speaker 2>arrows,</v>

1329
00:52:11.810 --> 00:52:16.810
<v Speaker 2>like people to think that you could like</v>
<v Speaker 2>light an Arrow and they go out and shoot</v>

1330
00:52:16.830 --> 00:52:20.630
<v Speaker 2>a fucking out wind and air works and</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of feet per second.</v>

1331
00:52:20.631 --> 00:52:22.910
<v Speaker 2>You're shooting it through the air and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to go out.</v>

1332
00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:25.340
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to be able to like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>boat on fire.</v>

1333
00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:26.330
<v Speaker 2>Get the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1334
00:52:26.331 --> 00:52:28.100
<v Speaker 2>there was probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was probably a rehearsal for the</v>

1335
00:52:28.101 --> 00:52:30.170
<v Speaker 2>torch thing where they actually did have</v>
<v Speaker 2>regular torches and they're like,</v>

1336
00:52:30.171 --> 00:52:32.620
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't working guys.</v>

1337
00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:35.480
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Home Depot is probably like,</v>

1338
00:52:35.481 --> 00:52:37.480
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many fucking poses?</v>

1339
00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:42.720
<v Speaker 2>The biggest backyard?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing it at?</v>

1340
00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:45.380
<v Speaker 2>Home depot managers now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how many torches do they slow down</v>

1341
00:52:45.381 --> 00:52:47.450
<v Speaker 2>a second backyard torches.</v>

1342
00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:50.480
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those things with the like the bamboo</v>

1343
00:52:50.481 --> 00:52:53.660
<v Speaker 2>stalks that they're using for the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever the fuck the stick is.</v>

1344
00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:55.430
<v Speaker 2>It's just God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so.</v>

1345
00:52:55.610 --> 00:52:58.250
<v Speaker 2>It's so the sign of the Times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's such a poser move.</v>

1346
00:52:58.251 --> 00:52:59.780
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is opposed to moving and yet they</v>

1347
00:52:59.781 --> 00:53:02.980
<v Speaker 2>know that if you're a black person</v>
<v Speaker 2>walking through the teachers through the</v>

1348
00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:07.520
<v Speaker 2>streets of Charlottesville and you see</v>
<v Speaker 2>that coming your way and you know you're</v>

1349
00:53:07.521 --> 00:53:08.900
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're invoked by images,</v>

1350
00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:12.440
<v Speaker 2>images of America's past where that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that equal death because they</v>

1351
00:53:12.441 --> 00:53:14.780
<v Speaker 2>weren't back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The tortures were for your house,</v>

1352
00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:17.290
<v Speaker 2>you know the torches were for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were not for.</v>

1353
00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:20.900
<v Speaker 2>They were not just showing strength and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so and they know that and that's why</v>

1354
00:53:20.901 --> 00:53:22.580
<v Speaker 2>when people go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just free speech.</v>

1355
00:53:22.581 --> 00:53:26.160
<v Speaker 2>It's like we have to stop acting like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just for your speech.</v>

1356
00:53:26.161 --> 00:53:28.500
<v Speaker 2>If you're walking around the torch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely more than that.</v>

1357
00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:30.330
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to have a torch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone could see you.</v>

1358
00:53:30.430 --> 00:53:32.760
<v Speaker 2>It's not done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not so dark out that we can't see</v>

1359
00:53:32.761 --> 00:53:34.380
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially in those.</v>

1360
00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:36.420
<v Speaker 2>In that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My wife actually the other day was like,</v>

1361
00:53:36.421 --> 00:53:38.310
<v Speaker 2>there's a guy walking the street with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>blowtorch that she.</v>

1362
00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:40.290
<v Speaker 2>It's only now because we think like</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's that mean?</v>

1363
00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:42.540
<v Speaker 2>But like in the baby's a welder there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1364
00:53:42.541 --> 00:53:43.231
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wasn't,</v>

1365
00:53:43.231 --> 00:53:44.730
<v Speaker 2>she didn't call the cops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was just like on the phone.</v>

1366
00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:48.530
<v Speaker 2>He got organized through the torch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the idea is that that,</v>

1367
00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:51.330
<v Speaker 2>that didn't alert her because it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>just some guy walking around the torch,</v>

1368
00:53:51.331 --> 00:53:54.030
<v Speaker 2>but it's specifically the context of</v>
<v Speaker 2>nighttime.</v>

1369
00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:56.880
<v Speaker 2>A group of hundreds of white guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>carrying torches.</v>

1370
00:53:56.881 --> 00:53:58.810
<v Speaker 2>Walking towards people is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not,</v>

1371
00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:00.930
<v Speaker 2>that's not free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not freedom of expression.</v>

1372
00:54:00.931 --> 00:54:04.620
<v Speaker 2>That chance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this chance that they were yelling out</v>

1373
00:54:04.650 --> 00:54:07.440
<v Speaker 2>to the whole thing was just so fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>bizarre.</v>

1374
00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:08.910
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did they organize?</v>

1375
00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:11.430
<v Speaker 2>Like where are these guys meeting up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure this out?</v>

1376
00:54:11.610 --> 00:54:13.800
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing as like live action</v>

1377
00:54:13.801 --> 00:54:15.570
<v Speaker 2>role play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're meeting up online and</v>

1378
00:54:15.571 --> 00:54:17.310
<v Speaker 2>then they probably meet for the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>time when they get there,</v>

1379
00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:18.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1380
00:54:18.601 --> 00:54:22.560
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's also just really,</v>

1381
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.971
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>

1382
00:54:23.971 --> 00:54:25.410
<v Speaker 2>it's really indicative of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

1383
00:54:25.411 --> 00:54:30.390
<v Speaker 2>the times we live in that they think</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can get away with this and then get</v>

1384
00:54:30.391 --> 00:54:32.380
<v Speaker 2>surprised when they get fired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they think that like,</v>

1385
00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.660
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll just do that and then we'll go to</v>

1386
00:54:33.661 --> 00:54:34.494
<v Speaker 2>applebee's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You</v>

1387
00:54:36.410 --> 00:54:37.141
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1388
00:54:37.141 --> 00:54:39.630
<v Speaker 2>we can see you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So decretive of them being fucking</v>

1389
00:54:39.631 --> 00:54:41.100
<v Speaker 2>stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why they're doing it in the</v>

1390
00:54:41.101 --> 00:54:43.350
<v Speaker 2>first place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is why when the president goes on</v>

1391
00:54:43.351 --> 00:54:46.650
<v Speaker 2>both sides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe there were people,</v>

1392
00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:49.200
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people said this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe there were some white people are</v>

1393
00:54:49.201 --> 00:54:49.471
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1394
00:54:49.471 --> 00:54:52.140
<v Speaker 2>I do feel like that my rights are being</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit trampled on and I really</v>

1395
00:54:52.141 --> 00:54:54.690
<v Speaker 2>want to show up the minute you hear</v>
<v Speaker 2>people chanting like all whatever the</v>

1396
00:54:54.691 --> 00:54:56.310
<v Speaker 2>antisemitic sematic things they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>

1397
00:54:56.490 --> 00:54:57.900
<v Speaker 2>You kind of go home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1398
00:54:57.901 --> 00:55:02.010
<v Speaker 2>Well what were they saying about take it</v>
<v Speaker 2>back from the Jews are stop the Jews</v>

1399
00:55:02.011 --> 00:55:04.030
<v Speaker 2>from taking over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1400
00:55:04.110 --> 00:55:05.090
<v Speaker 2>And then the president go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1401
00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:06.780
<v Speaker 2>and the president can't come out against</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1402
00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:08.003
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1403
00:55:08.070 --> 00:55:12.840
<v Speaker 2>well he's seeing people open carrying</v>
<v Speaker 2>with military outfits on walking with</v>

1404
00:55:12.841 --> 00:55:14.910
<v Speaker 2>these folks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's seen these people walking down the</v>

1405
00:55:14.911 --> 00:55:19.590
<v Speaker 2>street with torches and he doesn't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of an articulate response to</v>

1406
00:55:19.591 --> 00:55:21.120
<v Speaker 2>that where he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1407
00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:23.820
<v Speaker 2>ladies and gents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not being inclusive.</v>

1408
00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:27.810
<v Speaker 2>This is not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not like stepping up and saying</v>

1409
00:55:27.811 --> 00:55:32.070
<v Speaker 2>that what we need to do is come to some</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of an understanding and be at peace</v>

1410
00:55:32.071 --> 00:55:33.900
<v Speaker 2>with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what America should be.</v>

1411
00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:35.010
<v Speaker 2>But will you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1412
00:55:35.070 --> 00:55:37.500
<v Speaker 2>But you started it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Articulate response.</v>

1413
00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:39.510
<v Speaker 2>Like that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not his thing.</v>

1414
00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:42.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean he used to be more articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really weird.</v>

1415
00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:45.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't think men should do anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're 70.</v>

1416
00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:48.390
<v Speaker 2>I really don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're older.</v>

1417
00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:51.270
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking skin's falling off their</v>

1418
00:55:51.271 --> 00:55:53.310
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their back starts to hurt.</v>

1419
00:55:53.311 --> 00:55:56.070
<v Speaker 2>They're cranky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think when you get to be that</v>

1420
00:55:56.071 --> 00:55:57.540
<v Speaker 2>age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should just shut the fuck up.</v>

1421
00:55:57.570 --> 00:55:58.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should.</v>

1422
00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:00.510
<v Speaker 2>You should sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should go fishing or something.</v>

1423
00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:02.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you definitely shouldn't have the</v>

1424
00:56:02.101 --> 00:56:04.470
<v Speaker 2>kind of insane high pressure job that by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>

1425
00:56:04.471 --> 00:56:08.130
<v Speaker 2>nobody should have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody should be the one guy that run or</v>

1426
00:56:08.131 --> 00:56:09.930
<v Speaker 2>the one woman who runs the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

1427
00:56:09.931 --> 00:56:12.060
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an insane responsibility.</v>

1428
00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:14.320
<v Speaker 2>I was reading about Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1429
00:56:14.330 --> 00:56:17.850
<v Speaker 2>I put a tweet up yesterday about when</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Republicans were freaking out</v>

1430
00:56:17.851 --> 00:56:20.070
<v Speaker 2>because Obama wore a tan suit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1431
00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:23.130
<v Speaker 2>That there's all these this day and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama scandal,</v>

1432
00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:24.070
<v Speaker 2>like in the middle of a trump</v>

1433
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:24.340
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1434
00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:25.810
<v Speaker 3>he could get you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>

1435
00:56:25.811 --> 00:56:27.880
<v Speaker 3>They were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were trying to find something to</v>

1436
00:56:27.881 --> 00:56:29.260
<v Speaker 3>get mad at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was gay.</v>

1437
00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:31.390
<v Speaker 3>There'll be days when you wouldn't wear</v>
<v Speaker 3>a jacket.</v>

1438
00:56:31.391 --> 00:56:33.680
<v Speaker 3>Like he would just wear like a button</v>
<v Speaker 3>down shirt and a tie and people were</v>

1439
00:56:33.681 --> 00:56:35.140
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to like bushes.</v>

1440
00:56:35.141 --> 00:56:38.160
<v Speaker 3>Thing was he always wore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>W Bush always wore a full suit and Obama</v>

1441
00:56:38.161 --> 00:56:39.250
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm still the president.</v>

1442
00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:43.930
<v Speaker 3>It's just hot in this room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people would gaze things that they</v>

1443
00:56:43.931 --> 00:56:46.180
<v Speaker 3>nit picked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is the thing that's so stupid.</v>

1444
00:56:46.181 --> 00:56:50.020
<v Speaker 3>There's many people on the left who had</v>
<v Speaker 3>big,</v>

1445
00:56:50.021 --> 00:56:54.070
<v Speaker 3>huge disagreements with Obama that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't able to express effectively</v>

1446
00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:56.260
<v Speaker 3>because we were too busy defending his</v>
<v Speaker 3>birth certificate.</v>

1447
00:56:57.530 --> 00:56:58.840
<v Speaker 3>It was a trump thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1448
00:56:58.890 --> 00:56:59.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was the trump thing.</v>

1449
00:56:59.830 --> 00:57:02.110
<v Speaker 3>He was ahead of that shit was the head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was certainly.</v>

1450
00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:04.660
<v Speaker 3>He saw that thing happened in sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>stepped into it like,</v>

1451
00:57:04.661 --> 00:57:05.530
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this spot.</v>

1452
00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:08.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We hire people to go investigate it and</v>

1453
00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:10.660
<v Speaker 3>Joe Arpaio was a part of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He sent people to.</v>

1454
00:57:12.450 --> 00:57:14.620
<v Speaker 3>There's all these tweets and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just sent a team to Hawaii.</v>

1455
00:57:14.650 --> 00:57:16.840
<v Speaker 3>The things they found,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's big.</v>

1456
00:57:16.841 --> 00:57:18.040
<v Speaker 3>It's sad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

1457
00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:21.190
<v Speaker 3>And then you look here we sit like</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody ever held him in.</v>

1458
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:24.010
<v Speaker 3>Trump never got held into account for</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything and still doesn't really get</v>

1459
00:57:24.011 --> 00:57:25.780
<v Speaker 3>held to account for anything that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>said or done.</v>

1460
00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:28.090
<v Speaker 3>What bothered you about Obama when he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was an office?</v>

1461
00:57:28.850 --> 00:57:31.090
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the stuff he did was business</v>
<v Speaker 3>as usual.</v>

1462
00:57:31.091 --> 00:57:32.460
<v Speaker 3>President stuff like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1463
00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:37.810
<v Speaker 3>using the military and nations and</v>
<v Speaker 3>killing innocent civilians that,</v>

1464
00:57:37.930 --> 00:57:39.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that didn't need to be caught up in a</v>

1465
00:57:39.401 --> 00:57:40.151
<v Speaker 3>war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean,</v>

1466
00:57:40.151 --> 00:57:41.980
<v Speaker 3>like drone shit and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1467
00:57:41.981 --> 00:57:43.270
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1468
00:57:43.370 --> 00:57:44.980
<v Speaker 3>we were supposed to get out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Afghanistan.</v>

1469
00:57:45.130 --> 00:57:48.370
<v Speaker 3>It's just regular president shit that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>see that his first,</v>

1470
00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:48.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1471
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:50.980
<v Speaker 3>I drank all the Obama Koolaid the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>time around,</v>

1472
00:57:50.981 --> 00:57:53.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hope and change a lot of hope and change</v>

1473
00:57:53.351 --> 00:57:55.210
<v Speaker 3>was about not being a president as</v>
<v Speaker 3>usual.</v>

1474
00:57:55.450 --> 00:57:56.590
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he really,</v>

1475
00:57:56.980 --> 00:57:58.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing that trump does really</v>

1476
00:57:58.481 --> 00:58:00.940
<v Speaker 3>effectively the thing that George w dot</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bush did really effectively.</v>

1477
00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:03.610
<v Speaker 3>Republicans do a good job of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They really know how to use the bully</v>

1478
00:58:03.611 --> 00:58:05.860
<v Speaker 3>pulpit to really push their things</v>
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>

1479
00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:08.740
<v Speaker 3>Not that trump has really done anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>to push things through,</v>

1480
00:58:08.741 --> 00:58:10.300
<v Speaker 3>but he knows how to be a bully from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>pulpit.</v>

1481
00:58:10.301 --> 00:58:15.040
<v Speaker 3>He hasn't really passing major</v>
<v Speaker 3>legislation but Obama because he was,</v>

1482
00:58:15.130 --> 00:58:18.140
<v Speaker 3>he wanted to be an adult and he really</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to be a unifier and I think a lot</v>

1483
00:58:18.141 --> 00:58:20.440
<v Speaker 3>of that comes really literally from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that he's half black and half</v>

1484
00:58:20.441 --> 00:58:21.270
<v Speaker 3>white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he,</v>

1485
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:23.620
<v Speaker 3>he has existed in more than one world.</v>

1486
00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:26.080
<v Speaker 3>He didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt like there was times where it's</v>

1487
00:58:26.081 --> 00:58:28.060
<v Speaker 3>like to just say you are an effective</v>
<v Speaker 3>speaker,</v>

1488
00:58:28.061 --> 00:58:31.030
<v Speaker 3>you could really push through like</v>
<v Speaker 3>single payer health care in a way like</v>

1489
00:58:31.031 --> 00:58:32.800
<v Speaker 3>at least the debate on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1490
00:58:32.801 --> 00:58:34.900
<v Speaker 3>so we don't settle for obamacare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1491
00:58:34.901 --> 00:58:36.940
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that he didn't and I,</v>

1492
00:58:36.941 --> 00:58:38.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never talked to the man.</v>

1493
00:58:38.381 --> 00:58:40.300
<v Speaker 3>I've never met him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm the only black person</v>

1494
00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:43.960
<v Speaker 3>associate with Hollywood has never met</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama but piss you off.</v>

1495
00:58:44.350 --> 00:58:45.880
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just feel sort of like,</v>

1496
00:58:46.030 --> 00:58:46.863
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I don't have.</v>

1497
00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:50.610
<v Speaker 3>My Dad has a picture of Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have been nice to be able to</v>

1498
00:58:50.611 --> 00:58:52.360
<v Speaker 3>tell my kids what was the first black</v>
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>

1499
00:58:52.361 --> 00:58:54.670
<v Speaker 3>Like I have no fucking idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1500
00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:58.810
<v Speaker 3>that he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he didn't use the full force of</v>

1501
00:58:58.811 --> 00:59:00.190
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of his presence because he was a</v>

1502
00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:03.700
<v Speaker 3>rockstar and I feel like that that could</v>
<v Speaker 3>have pushed some things through or at</v>

1503
00:59:03.701 --> 00:59:07.350
<v Speaker 3>least got us to debate things that even</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama going to,</v>

1504
00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:09.160
<v Speaker 3>when they asked him about marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gay marriage,</v>

1505
00:59:09.161 --> 00:59:10.750
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've evolved on that.</v>

1506
00:59:10.751 --> 00:59:12.700
<v Speaker 3>He had nothing to do with legalizing</v>
<v Speaker 3>marriage equality,</v>

1507
00:59:12.701 --> 00:59:15.070
<v Speaker 3>but the president saying that made a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people go,</v>

1508
00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:16.870
<v Speaker 3>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'm ready to evolve.</v>

1509
00:59:16.871 --> 00:59:19.270
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he used the full force of</v>

1510
00:59:19.271 --> 00:59:21.170
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of his bully pulpit in the way that I.</v>

1511
00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:22.130
<v Speaker 3>I always thought I wanted</v>

1512
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:24.530
<v Speaker 2>him to drive the presidency of the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>the George W Bush did.</v>

1513
00:59:24.531 --> 00:59:25.550
<v Speaker 2>Like I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no rules.</v>

1514
00:59:25.551 --> 00:59:27.580
<v Speaker 2>There's no law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel like when someone gets into</v>

1515
00:59:27.590 --> 00:59:31.130
<v Speaker 2>office they realized how complex the</v>
<v Speaker 2>inner workings of the federal government</v>

1516
00:59:31.131 --> 00:59:34.940
<v Speaker 2>really are and then they just kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>abandoned a lot of the ideas that they</v>

1517
00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:38.180
<v Speaker 2>wanted to push when they got in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can remember when Obama had that hope</v>

1518
00:59:38.181 --> 00:59:40.610
<v Speaker 2>and change website that had all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff about whistleblowers,</v>

1519
00:59:41.090 --> 00:59:44.870
<v Speaker 2>whistleblowers are going to be protected</v>
<v Speaker 2>under the Obama administration and then</v>

1520
00:59:45.050 --> 00:59:47.420
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you got an office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was worse on whistleblowers and</v>

1521
00:59:47.421 --> 00:59:50.060
<v Speaker 2>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he removed that section of the</v>

1522
00:59:50.061 --> 00:59:52.550
<v Speaker 2>hope and change website.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They deleted it after the whole,</v>

1523
00:59:53.250 --> 00:59:56.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Edward Snowden thing and the Bradley</v>

1524
00:59:56.030 --> 00:59:57.170
<v Speaker 2>Manning thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chelsea manning thing.</v>

1525
00:59:57.171 --> 00:59:58.390
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this,</v>

1526
00:59:58.660 --> 00:59:59.900
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1527
00:59:59.901 --> 01:00:01.610
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think usually we're not seeing that</v>

1528
01:00:01.611 --> 01:00:03.320
<v Speaker 2>with this current president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do think that's the thing where</v>

1529
01:00:03.321 --> 01:00:04.670
<v Speaker 2>they get in there and suddenly people</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

1530
01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:05.390
<v Speaker 2>you're [inaudible].</v>

1531
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:07.310
<v Speaker 2>There's a part of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are the most powerful individually</v>

1532
01:00:07.311 --> 01:00:09.650
<v Speaker 2>in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also the train is going this way</v>

1533
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:11.480
<v Speaker 2>like it's already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's already left the station,</v>

1534
01:00:11.481 --> 01:00:13.310
<v Speaker 2>so you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think that there is.</v>

1535
01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:18.080
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to get really an</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimate revolutionary mindset in that</v>

1536
01:00:18.110 --> 01:00:20.520
<v Speaker 2>in the president's seat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just want somebody who's real,</v>

1537
01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.310
<v Speaker 2>who's reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1538
01:00:22.550 --> 01:00:23.690
<v Speaker 2>You're not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get somebody who's</v>

1539
01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:28.880
<v Speaker 2>the Elisa Garza from black lives matter</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not going to be the president as much</v>

1540
01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:31.220
<v Speaker 2>as I think she'd be great at it because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just not going to end up with</v>

1541
01:00:31.221 --> 01:00:34.550
<v Speaker 2>somebody who actually has a</v>
<v Speaker 2>revolutionary mindset,</v>

1542
01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:37.340
<v Speaker 2>so I think that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then so then if you start out there,</v>

1543
01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.900
<v Speaker 2>then when we put those people in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they know,</v>

1544
01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:41.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the pressures of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>officer.</v>

1545
01:00:41.141 --> 01:00:42.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they're amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it automatically leads you to</v>

1546
01:00:42.861 --> 01:00:45.950
<v Speaker 2>capitulate and if you have a read of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>revolutionary mindset,</v>

1547
01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:50.980
<v Speaker 2>you mean you might be able to use that</v>
<v Speaker 2>for one aspect of being the leader of</v>

1548
01:00:51.021 --> 01:00:52.520
<v Speaker 2>the entire free world.</v>

1549
01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:56.090
<v Speaker 2>But what about all the other shit that</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy has to deal with all day long?</v>

1550
01:00:56.091 --> 01:00:58.610
<v Speaker 2>There's not enough time in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one has enough.</v>

1551
01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:01.700
<v Speaker 2>Trump apparently has enough time to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>golfing,</v>

1552
01:01:01.701 --> 01:01:03.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not doing it.</v>

1553
01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:05.810
<v Speaker 2>He's not doing this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people aren't even appointed in</v>

1554
01:01:05.811 --> 01:01:09.520
<v Speaker 2>the Pentagon shitload of jobs that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't even filled yet?</v>

1555
01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:11.330
<v Speaker 2>Currently for trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's extra time in the day,</v>

1556
01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:13.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do think and when I want to be</v>

1557
01:01:13.071 --> 01:01:14.600
<v Speaker 2>clear because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I know were listening.</v>

1558
01:01:14.601 --> 01:01:17.720
<v Speaker 2>When I say revolutionary mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean single payer healthcare is a</v>

1559
01:01:17.721 --> 01:01:21.130
<v Speaker 2>revolutionary mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like every American has the right to,</v>

1560
01:01:21.390 --> 01:01:23.600
<v Speaker 2>to healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every American has,</v>

1561
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:27.410
<v Speaker 2>every American has the right to send</v>
<v Speaker 2>their kids to good public schools that</v>

1562
01:01:27.411 --> 01:01:28.640
<v Speaker 2>are well funded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1563
01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:31.640
<v Speaker 2>these are things I think that are like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or when I say revolutionary mindset,</v>

1564
01:01:31.641 --> 01:01:33.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean like setting things on</v>
<v Speaker 2>fire,</v>

1565
01:01:33.141 --> 01:01:36.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean like revolutionary ideas that</v>
<v Speaker 2>every person in this country deserves,</v>

1566
01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:38.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now they think that that's,</v>

1567
01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:41.390
<v Speaker 2>those people aren't going to be in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>driver's seat of the White House.</v>

1568
01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:44.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>utilizing the resources that we have</v>

1569
01:01:44.511 --> 01:01:48.110
<v Speaker 2>because of the fact that we pay taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tremendous amount of money goes to the</v>

1570
01:01:48.111 --> 01:01:50.030
<v Speaker 2>federal government with very little</v>
<v Speaker 2>recourse.</v>

1571
01:01:50.031 --> 01:01:51.380
<v Speaker 2>There's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no audit.</v>

1572
01:01:51.590 --> 01:01:54.650
<v Speaker 2>You don't get like some sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It tells you exactly where your tax</v>

1573
01:01:54.651 --> 01:01:56.430
<v Speaker 2>dollars went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to pick you,</v>

1574
01:01:56.450 --> 01:01:58.390
<v Speaker 2>please send this to the school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah.</v>

1575
01:01:58.400 --> 01:01:59.720
<v Speaker 2>What would be important?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1576
01:01:59.721 --> 01:02:01.610
<v Speaker 2>what would it be more important to fund?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1577
01:02:01.790 --> 01:02:05.420
<v Speaker 2>I think we should all have that</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation and I just think that the</v>

1578
01:02:05.421 --> 01:02:09.980
<v Speaker 2>way it's structured right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of power that corporations</v>

1579
01:02:09.981 --> 01:02:11.540
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of power that special</v>

1580
01:02:11.541 --> 01:02:13.400
<v Speaker 2>interest groups have influenced the</v>
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>

1581
01:02:13.401 --> 01:02:18.230
<v Speaker 2>The amount of just sheer money in</v>
<v Speaker 2>politics with lobbyists.</v>

1582
01:02:18.231 --> 01:02:20.190
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this one community</v>

1583
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:22.890
<v Speaker 3>outside of Washington DC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the richest communities in</v>

1584
01:02:22.891 --> 01:02:25.290
<v Speaker 3>the world and it's all lobbyists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1585
01:02:25.530 --> 01:02:27.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean these are just people that using</v>

1586
01:02:27.931 --> 01:02:29.640
<v Speaker 3>and selling influence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1587
01:02:29.650 --> 01:02:30.061
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1588
01:02:30.061 --> 01:02:31.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

1589
01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:33.870
<v Speaker 3>People sort of call me a communist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think I'm not a communist at all,</v>

1590
01:02:33.871 --> 01:02:37.110
<v Speaker 3>but I certainly don't get anything out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of capitalists.</v>

1591
01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:41.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to make money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also believe I can help put a spread,</v>

1592
01:02:41.401 --> 01:02:45.090
<v Speaker 3>a better message and help you know and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and use my resources to help people.</v>

1593
01:02:45.091 --> 01:02:46.440
<v Speaker 3>But I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the,</v>

1594
01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:50.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm in show business like a business</v>
<v Speaker 3>show business.</v>

1595
01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:50.873
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

1596
01:02:51.090 --> 01:02:53.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know activists and I know how hard</v>

1597
01:02:53.371 --> 01:02:56.100
<v Speaker 3>they work and then I sometimes use my</v>
<v Speaker 3>resources to help those people out and</v>

1598
01:02:56.101 --> 01:02:58.260
<v Speaker 3>donate money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not like I'm not,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm in Kevin Hart's career,</v>

1602
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:02.560
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1603
01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:05.520
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm not Kevin Hart and I have a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of respect for Kevin Hart.</v>

1604
01:03:05.521 --> 01:03:08.070
<v Speaker 3>I think he's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like I have to sort of remind</v>

1605
01:03:08.071 --> 01:03:09.090
<v Speaker 3>myself and other people like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>activist next to my name.</v>

1607
01:03:11.641 --> 01:03:13.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>activist is actually a job.</v>

1608
01:03:13.531 --> 01:03:15.150
<v Speaker 3>I don't have that job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I do,</v>

1609
01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:16.980
<v Speaker 3>I do things that are engaged in</v>
<v Speaker 3>activism,</v>

1610
01:03:16.981 --> 01:03:19.260
<v Speaker 3>but I haven't met my tax form states,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the comedian,</v>

1611
01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:21.090

<v Speaker 3>what you have interests.</v>

1612
01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:24.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You also have thoughts about how things</v>

1613
01:03:24.391 --> 01:03:28.500
<v Speaker 3>can be better and you use your platform</v>
<v Speaker 3>to spread those thoughts.</v>

1614
01:03:28.501 --> 01:03:30.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I also want a bigger house.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1616
01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:35.400
<v Speaker 3>so and I think that like it's okay to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

1617
01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:37.200
<v Speaker 3>to do all those things you,</v>

01:03:37.201 --> 01:03:40.310
<v Speaker 3>as for my family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just because I want to roll around</v>

1619
01:03:40.330 --> 01:03:40.740
<v Speaker 3>my money.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I want a bigger house with my so I can</v>
<v Speaker 3>move my mom out to.</v>

1621
01:03:43.390 --> 01:03:45.330
<v Speaker 3>There are selfish interest interest in</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1622
01:03:45.331 --> 01:03:46.920
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1623
01:03:46.921 --> 01:03:48.790
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not trying to,</v>

1624
01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:51.810
<v Speaker 3>not trying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do think that this country has</v>

1625
01:03:51.811 --> 01:03:53.190
<v Speaker 3>level of resort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a website,</v>

1626
01:03:53.191 --> 01:03:56.100
<v Speaker 3>it's called donorschoose.org and I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to do a commercial,</v>

1627
01:03:56.101 --> 01:03:59.670
<v Speaker 3>but it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a website where schools in your</v>

1628
01:03:59.671 --> 01:04:01.170
<v Speaker 3>area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go to the website and you put in</v>

1629
01:04:01.290 --> 01:04:03.180
<v Speaker 3>your zip code and you will see the</v>
<v Speaker 3>school,</v>

1630
01:04:03.181 --> 01:04:06.420
<v Speaker 3>the public schools in your area that</v>
<v Speaker 3>need things and it's,</v>

1631
01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:10.170
<v Speaker 3>it's sad what they need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need paper,</v>

1632
01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:12.360
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to like,</v>

1633
01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:15.960
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to teach the kids how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>like learn how to read and we don't have</v>

1634
01:04:15.961 --> 01:04:17.820
<v Speaker 3>any books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where the fuck did that happen?</v>

1635
01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:22.460
<v Speaker 3>Where did it go wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so little money for schools that</v>

1636
01:04:22.461 --> 01:04:26.340
<v Speaker 3>teachers get paid like $30,000 a year</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's supposed to survive off of that</v>

1637
01:04:26.370 --> 01:04:29.160
<v Speaker 3>and every teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even at public and private schools,</v>

1638
01:04:29.161 --> 01:04:32.970
<v Speaker 3>but certainly public schools put their</v>
<v Speaker 3>paycheck back into the school because</v>

1639
01:04:32.971 --> 01:04:35.150
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kids need a.</v>

1640
01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:36.230
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to teach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1641
01:04:36.231 --> 01:04:38.190
<v Speaker 3>a learning thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't have the stuff and they can't</v>

1642
01:04:38.191 --> 01:04:39.290
<v Speaker 3>afford it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So every teach,</v>

1643
01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:42.840
<v Speaker 3>every public school teacher I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>known use some of their check to go back</v>

1644
01:04:42.841 --> 01:04:45.030
<v Speaker 3>into the school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1645
01:04:45.031 --> 01:04:47.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just like he's one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>most important things that we have there</v>

1646
01:04:47.911 --> 01:04:49.170
<v Speaker 3>not being entertaining,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making.</v>

1647
01:04:49.171 --> 01:04:50.004
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not making,</v>

1648
01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:52.350
<v Speaker 3>they're making $30 and some of them are</v>
<v Speaker 3>making $30,000 a year.</v>

1649
01:04:52.351 --> 01:04:54.390
<v Speaker 3>Some of them are like teacher's aides</v>
<v Speaker 3>who just out of college,</v>

1650
01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:56.490
<v Speaker 3>but they have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they don't put money into the</v>

1651
01:04:56.491 --> 01:04:59.340
<v Speaker 3>classroom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their kids will not have things and</v>

1652
01:04:59.341 --> 01:05:02.250
<v Speaker 3>that's not even private school teachers</v>
<v Speaker 3>do that but they may not put as much.</v>

1653
01:05:02.251 --> 01:05:04.590
<v Speaker 3>But yet every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every teacher I've ever known has to do</v>

1654
01:05:04.591 --> 01:05:06.480
<v Speaker 3>that and we don't and we don't think</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a problem.</v>

1655
01:05:06.481 --> 01:05:09.420
<v Speaker 3>Like I feel like why isn't it that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel like there'd be some way,</v>

1656
01:05:09.570 --> 01:05:12.960
<v Speaker 3>like why isn't Mark Zuckerberg public</v>
<v Speaker 3>school teacher getting a percentage?</v>

1657
01:05:12.970 --> 01:05:13.650
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean,</v>

1658
01:05:13.650 --> 01:05:17.080
<v Speaker 3>like some sort of like just put,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there shouldn't be some tax on all of</v>

1659
01:05:17.081 --> 01:05:18.520
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That goes back to our public school</v>

1660
01:05:18.521 --> 01:05:21.490
<v Speaker 3>teachers if we were to vote with school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I feel like it's weird to me that</v>

1661
01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:25.000
<v Speaker 3>like we're acting like these people come</v>
<v Speaker 3>to nowhere because Joel Olsteen's got</v>

1662
01:05:25.001 --> 01:05:27.850
<v Speaker 3>all that shit piled up basketball</v>
<v Speaker 3>stadium.</v>

1663
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.730
<v Speaker 3>I do think there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there nobody talks about that is like</v>

1664
01:05:30.731 --> 01:05:31.740
<v Speaker 3>hoarding money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1665
01:05:31.790 --> 01:05:35.210
<v Speaker 3>that's hoarding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hoarding to pay taxes,</v>

1666
01:05:35.590 --> 01:05:38.060
<v Speaker 3>don't have to pay taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're fucking straight up hard and</v>

1667
01:05:38.070 --> 01:05:38.560
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no,</v>

1668
01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:41.560
<v Speaker 3>there's no cat skeletons in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's an egg like billionaire</v>

1669
01:05:41.561 --> 01:05:43.330
<v Speaker 3>hoarding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like that's a thing,</v>

1670
01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:46.900
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is literally what made the guy who</v>

1671
01:05:46.901 --> 01:05:49.420
<v Speaker 3>created scientology get involved in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

1672
01:05:49.650 --> 01:05:53.110
<v Speaker 3>that was literally the idea behind l Ron</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hubbard making a shitload of money.</v>

1673
01:05:53.170 --> 01:05:55.000
<v Speaker 3>Created a religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Best way to make money.</v>

1674
01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:56.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's literally his quote.</v>

1675
01:05:57.130 --> 01:05:57.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

1676
01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:58.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we talked to,</v>

1677
01:05:58.481 --> 01:05:59.970

<v Speaker 3>but there's all these like,</v>

1678
01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:02.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like religion is a good way to</v>

1679
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:03.970
<v Speaker 3>make money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then there's all these motivational</v>

<v Speaker 3>which is uh,</v>

1712
01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:10.870
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're doing this thing where it's</v>

1713
01:07:10.871 --> 01:07:13.870
<v Speaker 3>like they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just are motivating people based on</v>

1714
01:07:13.871 --> 01:07:15.610
<v Speaker 3>the fact that they've read motivational</v>
<v Speaker 3>books.</v>

1715
01:07:16.810 --> 01:07:19.600
<v Speaker 3>The new take on Jesus is what Bieber's</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys doing right?</v>

1716
01:07:20.730 --> 01:07:25.480
<v Speaker 3>Is that I keep hearing wisps of beavers</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was happening is he has some Jesus</v>

1717
01:07:25.481 --> 01:07:29.770
<v Speaker 3>guy who's also influential athletes who</v>
<v Speaker 3>was the athletes he's got.</v>

1718

<v Speaker 3>really knows how to sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just had a tickle.</v>

1721
01:07:41.321 --> 01:07:43.800
<v Speaker 3>Those balls of Jesus lovers slow because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it,</v>

1722
01:07:43.850 --> 01:07:45.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get to that deeper level.</v>

1723
01:07:45.251 --> 01:07:48.940
<v Speaker 3>He's been famous since he was what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12 and all the money and he's probably</v>

1724
01:07:48.941 --> 01:07:52.690
<v Speaker 3>had all the sex with every different</v>
<v Speaker 3>combination of humanity he went out with</v>

1725
01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:54.350
<v Speaker 3>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this huge</v>

1726
01:07:56.080 --> 01:08:00.760
<v Speaker 3>next level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got stem cell people working on new</v>

1727
01:08:05.610 --> 01:08:08.710
<v Speaker 3>and it's always at all that he's done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the substances you can do and all</v>

1728
01:08:08.711 --> 01:08:09.790
<v Speaker 3>the combinations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's,</v>

1729
01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:13.300
<v Speaker 3>he's had all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's had all the new houses,</v>

1730
01:08:13.301 --> 01:08:15.380
<v Speaker 3>all the cars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you wake up in a room like what</v>

1731
01:08:15.381 --> 01:08:16.040
<v Speaker 3>does this mean?</v>

1732
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.110
<v Speaker 2>And so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a new take on Jesus for you.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Take a look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1745
01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:42.140
<v Speaker 2>The haircut and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the Jesus beard.</v>

1746
01:08:42.141 --> 01:08:44.630
<v Speaker 2>But Jesus with the hipster haircut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1747
01:08:44.631 --> 01:08:46.280
<v Speaker 2>He looks like a band member.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1748
01:08:46.281 --> 01:08:47.200
<v Speaker 2>it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1749
01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:49.340
<v Speaker 2>Like he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see him with a neck tattoo.</v>

1750
01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:50.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

1751
01:08:50.230 --> 01:08:53.530
<v Speaker 2>this is like grungy Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's not like pastors don't</v>

1752
01:08:53.531 --> 01:08:55.250
<v Speaker 2>normally wear suits and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>

1753
01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:57.513
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

1754
01:08:58.430 --> 01:08:59.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your take on Jesus.</v>

1755
01:08:59.841 --> 01:09:03.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that anybody can get</v>
<v Speaker 2>through with bieber did and be any</v>

1756
01:09:03.111 --> 01:09:06.290
<v Speaker 2>better than he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's insane to think that you</v>

1757
01:09:06.291 --> 01:09:11.291
<v Speaker 2>could take a child and not have them go</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the normal developmental shit</v>

1758
01:09:11.421 --> 01:09:14.300
<v Speaker 2>that we all go through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not being liked and trying to get people</v>

1759
01:09:14.301 --> 01:09:18.060
<v Speaker 2>to like you and dating a girl and being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting your heart broken,</v>

1760
01:09:18.370 --> 01:09:20.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting in a fight and get in arguments</v>

1761
01:09:20.781 --> 01:09:24.380
<v Speaker 2>and not having any money in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>neighbor's houses and getting a fucking</v>

1762
01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:29.430
<v Speaker 2>yet neighbors mansion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he did a lot of fucked up shit,</v>

1763
01:09:29.451 --> 01:09:32.000
<v Speaker 2>but I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is essentially like living on his</v>

1764
01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:35.300
<v Speaker 2>adolescent with a billion dollars in</v>
<v Speaker 2>public.</v>

1765
01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:37.700
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean we already saw how that works</v>

1766
01:09:37.701 --> 01:09:39.080
<v Speaker 2>out with Michael Jackson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it doesn't,</v>

1767
01:09:39.081 --> 01:09:40.020
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>

1768
01:09:40.030 --> 01:09:43.880
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't go well for anybody who has</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever got through maybe Jodie Foster,</v>

1769
01:09:43.881 --> 01:09:44.714
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know her.</v>

1770
01:09:44.750 --> 01:09:45.940
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be the only ones.</v>

1771
01:09:45.970 --> 01:09:48.350
<v Speaker 2>I think she got through it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she also likes turned the volume way</v>

1772
01:09:48.351 --> 01:09:50.000
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just disappeared.</v>

1773
01:09:50.001 --> 01:09:51.980
<v Speaker 2>She moved to Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She lived her life.</v>

1774
01:09:51.981 --> 01:09:53.360
<v Speaker 2>She had a whole family that people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1775
01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:56.220
<v Speaker 2>I think she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1776
01:09:56.260 --> 01:09:57.021
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>

1777
01:09:57.021 --> 01:09:58.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like Kurt Russell's and other dude</v>

1778
01:09:58.731 --> 01:10:01.380
<v Speaker 2>who like was a huge movie star as a kid</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now it's just like,</v>

1779
01:10:01.381 --> 01:10:02.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

1780
01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:06.200
<v Speaker 2>But most people don't get through that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can see the entire cast of different</v>

1781
01:10:06.201 --> 01:10:10.860
<v Speaker 2>strokes is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not taught brutacos fucked up like</v>

1782
01:10:10.990 --> 01:10:12.140
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know who that's not,</v>

1783
01:10:12.141 --> 01:10:13.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not,</v>

1784
01:10:13.041 --> 01:10:13.611
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1785
01:10:13.611 --> 01:10:14.540
<v Speaker 2>I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my daughter,</v>

1786
01:10:14.541 --> 01:10:16.910
<v Speaker 2>I have two daughters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my oldest daughter is definitely a</v>

1787
01:10:16.911 --> 01:10:19.440
<v Speaker 2>performer and wants to be in stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I told my,</v>

1788
01:10:19.670 --> 01:10:21.620
<v Speaker 2>my agent yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you ever see me bring her in here,</v>

1789
01:10:21.621 --> 01:10:24.560
<v Speaker 2>like I think I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means that means we're done.</v>

1790
01:10:25.410 --> 01:10:26.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means that I've lost all</v>

1791
01:10:26.751 --> 01:10:30.110
<v Speaker 2>perspective because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're even a person until</v>

1792
01:10:30.111 --> 01:10:32.620
<v Speaker 2>you're 25.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a work in progress.</v>

1793
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:35.960
<v Speaker 2>Why they don't let you rent a car and do</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need a person behind the wheel of</v>

1794
01:10:35.961 --> 01:10:37.070
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

1795
01:10:37.071 --> 01:10:40.160
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have that opinion until maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>about five or six years ago.</v>

1796
01:10:40.210 --> 01:10:42.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm like slowly starting to develop</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1797
01:10:42.171 --> 01:10:45.140
<v Speaker 2>Like realizing that when you see someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's young and stupid and doing dumb</v>

1798
01:10:45.141 --> 01:10:45.531
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1799
01:10:45.531 --> 01:10:47.840
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking brains not even ready</v>

1800
01:10:47.841 --> 01:10:48.471
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1801
01:10:48.471 --> 01:10:49.620
<v Speaker 2>I read it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1802
01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:50.540
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the older you get,</v>

1803
01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:52.180
<v Speaker 2>you might keep raising that level two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might.</v>

1804
01:10:52.190 --> 01:10:57.190
<v Speaker 2>He might end up being 30 and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that age bias.</v>

1805
01:10:58.410 --> 01:11:00.290
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's probably 68.</v>

1806
01:11:00.291 --> 01:11:04.640
<v Speaker 2>I think it's an age bias.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just understanding who you</v>

1807
01:11:04.641 --> 01:11:08.780
<v Speaker 2>are now today is very different than who</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were a decade ago or two decades.</v>

1808
01:11:08.781 --> 01:11:10.160
<v Speaker 2>If you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fucked up.</v>

1809
01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:12.320
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a Mohammed Ali quote,</v>

1810
01:11:12.321 --> 01:11:14.040
<v Speaker 2>a man who thinks the same way as 50</v>

1811
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:15.720
<v Speaker 3>as he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thirty years wasted 20 years of his</v>

1812
01:11:15.721 --> 01:11:16.554
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1813
01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:19.740
<v Speaker 3>you should be going through some new</v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences.</v>

1814
01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:21.450
<v Speaker 3>She'd be wiser.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wiser.</v>

1815
01:11:21.451 --> 01:11:22.051
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you should be like,</v>

1816
01:11:22.051 --> 01:11:23.430
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe I did that stump shit.</v>

1817
01:11:23.431 --> 01:11:26.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really sad when you talk to someone</v>

1818
01:11:26.011 --> 01:11:28.080
<v Speaker 3>who's 50 who doesn't know anything about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>

1819
01:11:28.081 --> 01:11:29.640
<v Speaker 3>doesn't read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't pay attention.</v>

1820
01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:34.650
<v Speaker 3>It's so awful about trump is he seems</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely uncurious.</v>

1821
01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:36.810
<v Speaker 3>Like he doesn't seem like a curious</v>
<v Speaker 3>individual.</v>

1822
01:11:36.811 --> 01:11:38.520
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't seem like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me that's the worst,</v>

1823
01:11:38.521 --> 01:11:40.980
<v Speaker 3>that's worse than dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's worse than racist.</v>

1824
01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:44.460
<v Speaker 3>Like I feel like it's just completely</v>
<v Speaker 3>uncurious about the outside world.</v>

1825
01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:49.500
<v Speaker 3>Well also the way he like adorns his</v>
<v Speaker 3>homes with gold,</v>

1826
01:11:49.770 --> 01:11:53.910
<v Speaker 3>like a 12 year old just got like a magic</v>
<v Speaker 3>bottle.</v>

1827
01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:58.140
<v Speaker 3>He gets to rub,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rub this genie bottle and they're like,</v>

1828
01:11:58.141 --> 01:11:59.640
<v Speaker 3>what do I want?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want everything</v>

1829
01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:06.090
<v Speaker 3>to furniture chandelier and if it's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>touchable gold,</v>

1830
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:07.540
<v Speaker 3>gold colored,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1831
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:08.460
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1832
01:12:08.461 --> 01:12:09.780
<v Speaker 3>you know the people because the White</v>
<v Speaker 3>House,</v>

1833
01:12:09.781 --> 01:12:11.190
<v Speaker 3>this people work at the White House</v>
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>

1834
01:12:11.250 --> 01:12:12.500
<v Speaker 3>No matter who the president is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know those people.</v>

1835
01:12:12.501 --> 01:12:13.800
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>

1836
01:12:13.801 --> 01:12:15.810
<v Speaker 3>he's redecorating everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is he doing?</v>

1837
01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:16.920
<v Speaker 3>Is that what he's doing in the White</v>
<v Speaker 3>House?</v>

1838
01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:19.260
<v Speaker 3>There's a whole renovation that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>

1839
01:12:19.261 --> 01:12:22.200
<v Speaker 3>Like that's why part of the reason they</v>
<v Speaker 3>said he went on his 17 daybreak is that</v>

1840
01:12:22.201 --> 01:12:23.820
<v Speaker 3>they were doing a bunch of renovations</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the White House,</v>

1841
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:26.190
<v Speaker 3>allowed to just do whatever he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can do whatever you want.</v>

1842
01:12:26.191 --> 01:12:29.280
<v Speaker 3>So what if you wanted to do like</v>
<v Speaker 3>blacklight paintings that Jimi Hendrix,</v>

1843
01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:32.570
<v Speaker 3>Bruce Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the problem with the,</v>

1844
01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:37.050
<v Speaker 3>with the presidency here to for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We thought there was limits on stuff and</v>

1845
01:12:37.051 --> 01:12:39.510
<v Speaker 3>trump doesn't believe in limits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he was reserved.</v>

1846
01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:40.270
<v Speaker 3>We thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1847
01:12:40.270 --> 01:12:44.770
<v Speaker 3>it'll naturally the natural selection of</v>
<v Speaker 3>running for president only elevates the</v>

1848
01:12:44.771 --> 01:12:48.120
<v Speaker 3>best people or the people most prepared</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the job.</v>

1849
01:12:48.121 --> 01:12:50.320
<v Speaker 3>And I mean I'm not obviously there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>lots of people get appointed to go to</v>

1850
01:12:50.321 --> 01:12:52.230
<v Speaker 3>that person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we generally.</v>

1851
01:12:52.230 --> 01:12:54.540
<v Speaker 3>People thought that like just the</v>
<v Speaker 3>natural selection process.</v>

1852
01:12:54.541 --> 01:12:57.750
<v Speaker 3>Like in the same way that like kinda</v>
<v Speaker 3>like connor just kind of mcgregor just</v>

1853
01:12:57.751 --> 01:13:00.540
<v Speaker 3>upset the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Usually we thought up until then you had</v>

1854
01:13:00.541 --> 01:13:03.930
<v Speaker 3>to be a professional boxer who had lots</v>
<v Speaker 3>of fights before you got the floyd</v>

1855
01:13:03.931 --> 01:13:05.370
<v Speaker 3>mayweather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then caught is like,</v>

1856
01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:08.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's the way that works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not mad.</v>

1857
01:13:08.011 --> 01:13:09.670
<v Speaker 3>This is not about completely different</v>
<v Speaker 3>situation,</v>

1858
01:13:09.671 --> 01:13:10.860
<v Speaker 3>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not about me.</v>

1859
01:13:10.861 --> 01:13:13.190
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm kind of a big car fan so I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>not A.</v>

1860
01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:15.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm not mad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know you're writing a new way.</v>

1861
01:13:15.381 --> 01:13:16.320
<v Speaker 3>The new way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people are like,</v>

1862
01:13:16.321 --> 01:13:18.210
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know you could do that and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes other people get,</v>

1863
01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:22.560
<v Speaker 3>so I think trump has done that to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>presidency where it's like we thought</v>

1864
01:13:22.561 --> 01:13:25.470
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the process of natural selection</v>

1865
01:13:25.890 --> 01:13:29.370
<v Speaker 3>ended up with somebody who at least have</v>
<v Speaker 3>a through line of an idea because if you</v>

1866
01:13:29.371 --> 01:13:31.830
<v Speaker 3>don't agree with Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 3>George W Bush or you don't agree with</v>

1867
01:13:31.831 --> 01:13:33.300
<v Speaker 3>Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you at least knew there was a through</v>

1868
01:13:33.301 --> 01:13:36.660
<v Speaker 3>line of an idea and I think with trump</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not the belief that there's a</v>

1869
01:13:36.661 --> 01:13:37.680
<v Speaker 3>through line of an idea.</v>

1870
01:13:38.330 --> 01:13:41.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's also this idea that he wings</v>

1871
01:13:41.581 --> 01:13:42.540
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1872
01:13:42.690 --> 01:13:44.250
<v Speaker 3>He gets in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has these press conferences,</v>

1873
01:13:44.251 --> 01:13:47.490
<v Speaker 3>like that one that he had that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>really set a lot of people back like</v>

1874
01:13:47.491 --> 01:13:49.170
<v Speaker 3>just a couple of months into his</v>
<v Speaker 3>presidency.</v>

1875
01:13:49.410 --> 01:13:54.410
<v Speaker 3>We went on this like 70 minute rant and</v>
<v Speaker 3>just rallied about fake news and people</v>

1876
01:13:55.410 --> 01:13:57.660
<v Speaker 3>came out of that going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what in the fuck was that like?</v>

1877
01:13:57.661 --> 01:14:00.480
<v Speaker 3>Was that or not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was.</v>

1878
01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:02.520
<v Speaker 3>Was that the recent one?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1879
01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:04.390
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking like way earlier.</v>

1880
01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:08.790
<v Speaker 3>One of the first ones that he did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember I got texts from friends who</v>

1881
01:14:08.791 --> 01:14:10.830
<v Speaker 3>are Republicans were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not good.</v>

1882
01:14:11.130 --> 01:14:12.310
<v Speaker 3>It seems unstable.</v>

1883
01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:13.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1884
01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:13.900
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that,</v>

1885
01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:15.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the one in Phoenix felt a little</v>

1886
01:14:15.671 --> 01:14:17.260
<v Speaker 2>bit like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1887
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:20.500
<v Speaker 2>it's a little bit like Jeff Foxworthy do</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the old.</v>

1888
01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:22.150
<v Speaker 2>You might be a redneck joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1889
01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:23.170
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>write some new stuff.</v>

1890
01:14:23.171 --> 01:14:26.320
<v Speaker 2>Like if he was still doing the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

1891
01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:28.990
<v Speaker 2>like he's still going over the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He still legislate.</v>

1892
01:14:29.170 --> 01:14:30.190
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

1893
01:14:30.191 --> 01:14:32.470
<v Speaker 2>stop saying Crooked Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have as a nation,</v>

1894
01:14:32.471 --> 01:14:34.120
<v Speaker 2>even fans of Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we got it.</v>

1895
01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:37.120
<v Speaker 2>Move on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's still doing the same electoral</v>

1896
01:14:37.121 --> 01:14:38.710
<v Speaker 2>victory and all these things that he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>been doing.</v>

1897
01:14:38.711 --> 01:14:40.510
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem like get to a new idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1898
01:14:40.690 --> 01:14:44.260
<v Speaker 2>Well that was one of the really sad</v>
<v Speaker 2>moments when he was confronted by a</v>

1899
01:14:44.261 --> 01:14:48.610
<v Speaker 2>reporter and he was talking about how he</v>
<v Speaker 2>won by the biggest margin ever.</v>

1900
01:14:48.611 --> 01:14:50.320
<v Speaker 2>And the reporter said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well actually sir,</v>

1901
01:14:50.321 --> 01:14:51.970
<v Speaker 2>that's not true because of this and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1902
01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:52.611
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1903
01:14:52.611 --> 01:14:54.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm from Republicans as a Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1904
01:14:54.641 --> 01:14:56.190
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not true know.</v>

1905
01:14:56.410 --> 01:14:59.920
<v Speaker 2>And he starts rattling off the the</v>
<v Speaker 2>actual statistics and he goes,</v>

1906
01:14:59.921 --> 01:15:01.510
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll agree that I won by a large</v>

1907
01:15:01.511 --> 01:15:02.100
<v Speaker 2>margin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1908
01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:03.910
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are the president.</v>

1909
01:15:04.930 --> 01:15:05.890
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1910
01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:09.040
<v Speaker 2>Who are you like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of crazy ego battles at the</v>

1911
01:15:09.041 --> 01:15:12.310
<v Speaker 2>have on live television?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a guy who's way more related to</v>

1912
01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:14.440
<v Speaker 2>beaver than he is to any other president</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as like,</v>

1913
01:15:14.441 --> 01:15:16.030
<v Speaker 2>he's surrounded by people who have told</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

1914
01:15:16.031 --> 01:15:17.050
<v Speaker 2>Good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good job,</v>

1915
01:15:17.051 --> 01:15:18.590
<v Speaker 2>good decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the.</v>

1916
01:15:18.810 --> 01:15:20.320
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the insanity of like,</v>

1917
01:15:20.321 --> 01:15:22.420
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was the fake Time magazine cover</v>

1918
01:15:22.421 --> 01:15:24.160
<v Speaker 2>that was in one that was in his golf</v>
<v Speaker 2>courses.</v>

1919
01:15:24.161 --> 01:15:24.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1920
01:15:24.890 --> 01:15:26.290
<v Speaker 2>that's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not,</v>

1921
01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:27.550
<v Speaker 2>that's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1922
01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:30.260
<v Speaker 2>we've all taken the fun fake magazine</v>
<v Speaker 2>cover.</v>

1923
01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:32.290
<v Speaker 2>We don't put it up and make people think</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's real.</v>

1924
01:15:32.290 --> 01:15:34.640
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there's another one that they just.</v>

1925
01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:36.880
<v Speaker 2>I just found out recently at one of his</v>
<v Speaker 2>golf courses,</v>

1926
01:15:36.881 --> 01:15:41.050
<v Speaker 2>there is a fake confederate monument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a plaque that says there was a</v>

1927
01:15:41.051 --> 01:15:43.960
<v Speaker 2>battle here that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they called this the river of blood,</v>

1928
01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:44.621
<v Speaker 2>the Dah,</v>

1931
01:15:47.351 --> 01:15:49.000
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of that happened.</v>

01:15:49.841 --> 01:15:51.520
<v Speaker 2>Donald says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump under the bottom,</v>

1934
01:15:51.521 --> 01:15:53.230
<v Speaker 2>like he saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald J dot trump.</v>

1943
01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:12.010
<v Speaker 2>That's like the Potomac river near the</v>

1949
01:16:30.401 --> 01:16:33.070
<v Speaker 2>controversial remarks about the violent</v>
<v Speaker 2>weekend in Charlottesville.</v>

1950
01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:35.380
<v Speaker 2>Fucking a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they went to like three different</v>

1951
01:16:35.381 --> 01:16:37.780
<v Speaker 2>historians and one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were like,</v>

1952
01:16:37.781 --> 01:16:38.410
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

1953
01:16:38.410 --> 01:16:41.080
<v Speaker 2>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not even getting something wrong.</v>

1954
01:16:41.081 --> 01:16:42.730
<v Speaker 2>It's not like she had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was just.</v>

1955
01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:43.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just that didn't,</v>

1956
01:16:44.010 --> 01:16:48.160
<v Speaker 2>do you think he did that or someone did</v>
<v Speaker 2>that to him in the New York Times story?</v>

1957
01:16:48.161 --> 01:16:49.570
<v Speaker 2>They questioned him about it and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

1958
01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:51.970
<v Speaker 2>he says no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to his story and you said it</v>

1959
01:16:51.971 --> 01:16:52.970
<v Speaker 2>was a very bubbly blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

1960
01:16:52.971 --> 01:16:53.171
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

1961
01:16:53.171 --> 01:16:55.760
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is in the a c?</v>

1962
01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:56.540
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1963
01:16:56.540 --> 01:16:57.580
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no way.</v>

1964
01:16:57.610 --> 01:17:00.130
<v Speaker 2>Nothing like that ever happened there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was the last segment about the</v>

1965
01:17:00.131 --> 01:17:01.680
<v Speaker 2>accuracy of the plaque,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>

1966
01:17:02.770 --> 01:17:06.460
<v Speaker 2>and told the publication that he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain that the area was a prime site</v>

1967
01:17:06.461 --> 01:17:09.470
<v Speaker 2>for river crossing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if people are crossing the river and</v>

1968
01:17:09.471 --> 01:17:10.040
<v Speaker 2>you happen to be</v>

1969
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:14.000
<v Speaker 3>in a civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say that people were shot a lot</v>

1970
01:17:14.001 --> 01:17:14.834
<v Speaker 3>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1971
01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:19.580
<v Speaker 3>Because you understand how water goes</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're in war.</v>

1972
01:17:19.581 --> 01:17:21.770
<v Speaker 3>When you're walking around was like you</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't get shot everywhere you are</v>

1973
01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:25.070
<v Speaker 3>because you're in war is the battle's</v>
<v Speaker 3>not everywhere.</v>

1974
01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:29.210
<v Speaker 3>People are the trump self-professed big</v>
<v Speaker 3>history fan was unable to name the</v>

1975
01:17:29.211 --> 01:17:30.980
<v Speaker 3>historians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He claimed that told him the site was</v>

1976
01:17:30.981 --> 01:17:33.530
<v Speaker 3>known as the river of blood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1977
01:17:34.590 --> 01:17:38.480
<v Speaker 3>this is so wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me.</v>

1978
01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:39.360
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

1979
01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:40.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's been there for a while,</v>

1980
01:17:40.491 --> 01:17:41.870
<v Speaker 3>so to me it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is again,</v>

1981
01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:44.330
<v Speaker 3>this is where the press,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forget the fake news media,</v>

1982
01:17:44.331 --> 01:17:45.740
<v Speaker 3>the fake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fake news.</v>

1983
01:17:46.010 --> 01:17:50.870
<v Speaker 3>This is where the press really fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 3>is by entertaining him through the</v>

1984
01:17:50.871 --> 01:17:55.871
<v Speaker 3>election season without really making it</v>
<v Speaker 3>hard effort to go right at the truth of</v>

1985
01:17:56.481 --> 01:17:58.280
<v Speaker 3>the matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like people thought again,</v>

1986
01:17:58.281 --> 01:18:00.190
<v Speaker 3>I think people were still decided to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it's,</v>

1987
01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:02.920
<v Speaker 3>he's not going to win so we can drain</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting.</v>

1988
01:18:03.070 --> 01:18:03.920
<v Speaker 3>We're getting good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1989
01:18:03.921 --> 01:18:05.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean even people who didn't agree with</v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

1990
01:18:05.391 --> 01:18:06.290
<v Speaker 3>people on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were like,</v>

1991
01:18:06.291 --> 01:18:07.760
<v Speaker 3>he's not going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had friends who were like,</v>

1992
01:18:07.870 --> 01:18:09.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't even waste time thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1993
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:10.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you better realized,</v>

1994
01:18:10.530 --> 01:18:12.920
<v Speaker 3>probably want to waste some time that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1995
01:18:12.921 --> 01:18:14.900
<v Speaker 3>that they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People didn't go after him.</v>

1996
01:18:14.901 --> 01:18:16.160
<v Speaker 3>Hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all these little things.</v>

1997
01:18:16.161 --> 01:18:17.540
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's again,</v>

1998
01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:21.740
<v Speaker 3>Obama had to pull out several copies of</v>
<v Speaker 3>his birth certificate</v>

1999
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:25.700
<v Speaker 3>and yet people want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he's racist.</v>

2000
01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:26.570
<v Speaker 3>Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2001
01:18:26.570 --> 01:18:29.090
<v Speaker 3>Here's my take on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck if he was born in</v>

2002
01:18:29.091 --> 01:18:30.410
<v Speaker 3>Kenya.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>

2003
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:33.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember where I was born.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They told me I was born in New Jersey,</v>

2004
01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:36.200
<v Speaker 3>but I wasn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were there but you weren't.</v>

2005
01:18:36.201 --> 01:18:39.320
<v Speaker 3>You weren't paying attention was</v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently I didn't understand words</v>

2006
01:18:39.650 --> 01:18:41.030
<v Speaker 3>like I didn't understand cities.</v>

2007
01:18:41.070 --> 01:18:44.330
<v Speaker 3>It's not your choice were to be born.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that you're better off because</v>

2008
01:18:44.331 --> 01:18:47.810
<v Speaker 3>your choice was you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some by divine birthright.</v>

2009
01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:51.020
<v Speaker 3>You were shit out in Michigan so you</v>
<v Speaker 3>could run this country.</v>

2010
01:18:51.021 --> 01:18:53.720
<v Speaker 3>That's why the whole immigration thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the refugee thing is ridiculous,</v>

2011
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:56.660
<v Speaker 3>but that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it doesn't it.</v>

2012
01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.150
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it does matter.</v>

2013
01:18:59.151 --> 01:19:02.090
<v Speaker 3>And also they were using.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was born in Kenya as a way to promote</v>

2014
01:19:02.091 --> 01:19:05.180
<v Speaker 3>a lot of conspiracy theories that were</v>
<v Speaker 3>connected to him that would none of</v>

2015
01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:06.320
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you start to buy the.</v>

2016
01:19:06.570 --> 01:19:07.403
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was.</v>

2017
01:19:07.530 --> 01:19:09.500
<v Speaker 3>It was a fake birth certificate because</v>
<v Speaker 3>his parents,</v>

2018
01:19:09.501 --> 01:19:11.810
<v Speaker 3>when he was born knew he was going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first black president,</v>

2019
01:19:11.811 --> 01:19:16.811
<v Speaker 3>so they got them a fake Hawaii and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you attach a lot of things to him that</v>

2020
01:19:17.031 --> 01:19:19.610
<v Speaker 3>illegitimized his presidency because if</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump had said,</v>

2021
01:19:19.611 --> 01:19:22.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't agree with Obama's policy on</v>
<v Speaker 3>this and this and this and left all of</v>

2022
01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:24.360
<v Speaker 3>stuff behind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then yeah,</v>

2023
01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:25.110
<v Speaker 3>let's see.</v>

2024
01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:27.920
<v Speaker 3>The run for president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the craziest one was that he was</v>

2025
01:19:27.921 --> 01:19:31.210
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a mentoring candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a,</v>

2026
01:19:31.211 --> 01:19:35.240
<v Speaker 3>a undercover Muslim that was sent to</v>
<v Speaker 3>destroy America.</v>

2027
01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:38.810
<v Speaker 3>He's trying to destroy America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't he just be a disappointing</v>

2028
01:19:38.811 --> 01:19:40.310
<v Speaker 3>president?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that enough?</v>

2029
01:19:40.510 --> 01:19:43.520
<v Speaker 3>Must must we take it to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the part about this disturbing is</v>

2030
01:19:43.521 --> 01:19:48.350
<v Speaker 3>that Obama who was just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were questioning the legitimacy of</v>

2031
01:19:48.351 --> 01:19:50.720
<v Speaker 3>his presidency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like just the fact that he shouldn't be</v>

2032
01:19:50.721 --> 01:19:51.554
<v Speaker 3>president [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not.</v>

2033
01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:54.800
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't born here in this country and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a and then with trump,</v>

2034
01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:58.350
<v Speaker 3>all these things should be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should should question.</v>

2035
01:19:58.610 --> 01:20:02.180
<v Speaker 3>Is he fit enough to run for president?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is He.</v>

2036
01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:04.430
<v Speaker 3>Is He.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is he a serious enough person?</v>

2037
01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:05.240
<v Speaker 3>Because I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2038
01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:08.310
<v Speaker 3>he can you question people's mental,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's he a serious</v>

2039
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:10.710
<v Speaker 2>enough person to run for president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's clearly.</v>

2040
01:20:10.711 --> 01:20:12.690
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not serious enough to be president.</v>

2041
01:20:12.691 --> 01:20:17.691
<v Speaker 2>You have fake Time magazine Art Take</v>
<v Speaker 2>Time magazine one is almost inexcusable.</v>

2042
01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:22.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean it absolutely unexcused been on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cover of time more than anybody</v>

2043
01:20:22.351 --> 01:20:22.891
<v Speaker 2>else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is again,</v>

2044
01:20:22.891 --> 01:20:25.980
<v Speaker 2>it's like this is not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But had he been on the cover before?</v>

2045
01:20:25.981 --> 01:20:27.630
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

2046
01:20:27.631 --> 01:20:28.441
<v Speaker 2>but he had been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

2047
01:20:28.441 --> 01:20:30.210
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we'd have to look this up.</v>

2048
01:20:30.211 --> 01:20:32.940
<v Speaker 2>He had been on the cover but not that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that picture it had.</v>

2049
01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.200
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't that picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't that.</v>

2050
01:20:34.201 --> 01:20:37.350
<v Speaker 2>There was do that then why wouldn't you</v>
<v Speaker 2>just frame the real one?</v>

2051
01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:39.910
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to ask you,</v>

2052
01:20:39.911 --> 01:20:41.130
<v Speaker 2>but that's what's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2053
01:20:41.131 --> 01:20:43.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean the guy has actually been on time</v>
<v Speaker 2>magazine,</v>

2054
01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:46.980
<v Speaker 2>so if he has know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's certainly been on the cover of</v>

2055
01:20:46.981 --> 01:20:47.830
<v Speaker 2>magazines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2056
01:20:48.050 --> 01:20:48.330
<v Speaker 2>hey.</v>

2057
01:20:48.330 --> 01:20:49.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like get another one,</v>

2058
01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:52.580
<v Speaker 2>get one that you sound like you're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>famous.</v>

2059
01:20:52.581 --> 01:20:53.760
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the weird part.</v>

2060
01:20:54.090 --> 01:20:57.960
<v Speaker 2>He needs to feel like the most famous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He needs to feel like the.</v>

2061
01:20:58.260 --> 01:21:01.020
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the thought process behind that?</v>

2062
01:21:01.021 --> 01:21:03.660
<v Speaker 2>Did someone bring that to him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he say,</v>

2063
01:21:03.661 --> 01:21:06.090
<v Speaker 2>I need to be on Time magazine?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they don't put me on.</v>

2064
01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:09.090
<v Speaker 2>Kept me a fake one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a real one.</v>

2065
01:21:09.210 --> 01:21:10.140
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the big one.</v>

2066
01:21:10.170 --> 01:21:11.260
<v Speaker 2>That's the fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because look,</v>

2067
01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:14.310
<v Speaker 2>Time magazine would never say trump is</v>
<v Speaker 2>hitting on all fronts.</v>

2068
01:21:14.340 --> 01:21:16.590
<v Speaker 2>Even TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's entertainment weekly.</v>

2069
01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:21.210
<v Speaker 2>Obama's next move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can he curb healthcare costs?</v>

2070
01:21:21.230 --> 01:21:22.460
<v Speaker 2>How stressed at Chapin?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

2071
01:21:22.530 --> 01:21:25.890
<v Speaker 2>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The apprentice is a television smash.</v>

2072
01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:26.900
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

2073
01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:27.733
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel it.</v>

2074
01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:32.940
<v Speaker 2>I feel like somebody made it for him as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a joke and then he is this real.</v>

2075
01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:34.770
<v Speaker 2>This one's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2076
01:21:34.771 --> 01:21:38.760
<v Speaker 2>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was this man may turn you green</v>

2077
01:21:38.761 --> 01:21:42.150
<v Speaker 2>within me or just turn you off?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Flaunting it is the game and trump is</v>

2078
01:21:42.151 --> 01:21:43.470
<v Speaker 2>the name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems like a real one.</v>

2079
01:21:43.850 --> 01:21:45.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also not complimentary enough.</v>

2080
01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:49.450
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not hitting on all fronts as trump.</v>

2081
01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:52.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people have looked at the</v>

2082
01:21:52.261 --> 01:21:53.730
<v Speaker 2>originals?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's clearly not the right,</v>

2083
01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:55.750
<v Speaker 2>like the font isn't laid out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is all sorts of things that.</v>

2084
01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:56.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it looks fake.</v>

2085
01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:59.010
<v Speaker 2>It looks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like when you go to like the,</v>

2086
01:21:59.011 --> 01:22:00.870
<v Speaker 2>like a carnival and they give you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2087
01:22:00.871 --> 01:22:02.190
<v Speaker 2>put you on the cover of sports</v>
<v Speaker 2>illustrated.</v>

2088
01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:06.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't like his lips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something about.</v>

2089
01:22:06.301 --> 01:22:10.830
<v Speaker 2>It's like people like when they make</v>
<v Speaker 2>faces with their lips,</v>

2090
01:22:10.831 --> 01:22:12.750
<v Speaker 2>like you can kind of tell if they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind.</v>

2091
01:22:12.810 --> 01:22:13.643
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>

2092
01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:16.980
<v Speaker 2>it seems so weird to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to be true.</v>

2093
01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:18.211
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2094
01:22:18.211 --> 01:22:19.150
<v Speaker 2>It's like he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does.</v>

2095
01:22:19.290 --> 01:22:21.270
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does not angry.</v>

2096
01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:21.691
<v Speaker 2>He.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2097
01:22:21.691 --> 01:22:24.780
<v Speaker 2>he looks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he looks like he's perpetually either he</v>

2098
01:22:24.781 --> 01:22:26.340
<v Speaker 2>looks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he looks disappointed when he sits</v>

2099
01:22:26.341 --> 01:22:30.360
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the massive amount of money and</v>

2100
01:22:30.361 --> 01:22:35.361
<v Speaker 2>power and then deciding I want to run</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing to really want to be.</v>

2101
01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:37.400
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't really want to be.</v>

2102
01:22:37.401 --> 01:22:39.720
<v Speaker 2>They don't personally know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he,</v>

2103
01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:42.450
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he could have anticipated</v>

2104
01:22:42.451 --> 01:22:46.080
<v Speaker 2>that he was running against 16 people or</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 people who just couldn't.</v>

2105
01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:49.200
<v Speaker 2>Who Know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who should have all been the clear like,</v>

2106
01:22:49.201 --> 01:22:50.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of them should have been like,</v>

2107
01:22:50.131 --> 01:22:51.190
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>money Jeb Bush he gives,</v>

2108
01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:53.190
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of them had enough personality to</v>

2109
01:22:53.191 --> 01:22:55.290
<v Speaker 2>top him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bush seemed like you didn't really want</v>

2110
01:22:55.291 --> 01:22:58.010
<v Speaker 2>to do it either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seems like he was Kinda like half ass in</v>

2111
01:22:58.011 --> 01:22:58.321
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2112
01:22:58.321 --> 01:22:59.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't think George w really want to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

2113
01:22:59.911 --> 01:23:02.550
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing about America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can become the president and not</v>

2114
01:23:02.551 --> 01:23:05.010
<v Speaker 2>even really wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a rich white dude,</v>

2115
01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 2>like I guess I'll</v>

2116
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:08.200
<v Speaker 3>be the president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well who the fuck is going to do it</v>

2117
01:23:08.201 --> 01:23:09.970
<v Speaker 3>next?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's going to be interesting.</v>

2118
01:23:09.971 --> 01:23:12.340
<v Speaker 3>I just hope it's not the people that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whose names I already know.</v>

2119
01:23:12.341 --> 01:23:14.590
<v Speaker 3>I hope it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People talk about maybe Biden.</v>

2120
01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:17.620
<v Speaker 3>Can it not be so much?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I just feel like the thing about</v>

2121
01:23:17.621 --> 01:23:20.140
<v Speaker 3>that was excited about Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The black thing was exciting for me</v>

2122
01:23:20.141 --> 01:23:22.000
<v Speaker 3>personally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the fact that he was under the age,</v>

2123
01:23:22.001 --> 01:23:24.250
<v Speaker 3>like he was in his forties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was exciting.</v>

2124
01:23:24.251 --> 01:23:25.750
<v Speaker 3>Like it was like a president who would</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>

2125
01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:28.560
<v Speaker 3>who you know had life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had life and,</v>

2126
01:23:28.561 --> 01:23:30.470
<v Speaker 3>and also was still had a lot of life</v>
<v Speaker 3>ahead of him.</v>

2127
01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:31.713
<v Speaker 3>Like Dad did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

2128
01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:33.490
<v Speaker 3>now that he's done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's still like a young,</v>

2129
01:23:34.330 --> 01:23:35.260
<v Speaker 3>a young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>old man,</v>

2130
01:23:35.261 --> 01:23:36.094
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he was,</v>

2131
01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:38.260
<v Speaker 3>that he had done things you had probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>

2132
01:23:38.261 --> 01:23:38.681
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2133
01:23:38.681 --> 01:23:42.610
<v Speaker 3>I did a little coke and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he probably played video games.</v>

2134
01:23:42.610 --> 01:23:43.460
<v Speaker 3>He understood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2135
01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:44.360
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2136
01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:47.530
<v Speaker 3>the reason why I became such a pop</v>
<v Speaker 3>culture president because it was like he</v>

2137
01:23:47.531 --> 01:23:48.850
<v Speaker 3>would say I listen to Jay z and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2138
01:23:48.851 --> 01:23:50.170
<v Speaker 3>I believe he probably does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2139
01:23:50.171 --> 01:23:52.540
<v Speaker 3>Like it just felt like he felt like</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody who was connected to us in a</v>

2140
01:23:52.541 --> 01:23:54.840
<v Speaker 3>way that like trump is not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not one of them.</v>

2141
01:23:54.870 --> 01:23:57.490
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not one of the people and he's</v>

2142
01:23:57.491 --> 01:23:59.740
<v Speaker 3>never tried to be one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People know.</v>

2143
01:23:59.741 --> 01:24:04.741
<v Speaker 3>It's all so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never felt more disconnected than</v>

2144
01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:09.850
<v Speaker 3>right now from politics and from like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never felt like the president is</v>

2145
01:24:09.851 --> 01:24:12.310
<v Speaker 3>more disconnected from the people in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>United States either.</v>

2146
01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:15.250
<v Speaker 3>And the people that support him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boy there,</v>

2147
01:24:15.251 --> 01:24:18.940
<v Speaker 3>so I've never seen that before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>either the type of people that are like</v>

2148
01:24:18.941 --> 01:24:20.860
<v Speaker 3>really into Donald Trump being</v>
<v Speaker 3>president,</v>

2149
01:24:21.490 --> 01:24:23.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just everything.</v>

2150
01:24:23.090 --> 01:24:27.490
<v Speaker 3>And he says they hang on every word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they turn everything into a positive,</v>

2151
01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:31.070
<v Speaker 3>they spin everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they hashtag Maga.</v>

2152
01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:35.950
<v Speaker 3>It's really awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it feels to me like it's a very much</v>

2153
01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:37.300
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got Obama,</v>

2154
01:24:37.301 --> 01:24:39.420
<v Speaker 3>we get him like it feels like it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2155
01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:43.470
<v Speaker 3>like they were sick of how of the love</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Obama got even though by the end,</v>

2156
01:24:43.471 --> 01:24:46.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean Obama got a lot of love but it</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't as fervent by the end,</v>

2157
01:24:46.091 --> 01:24:47.830
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean until the.</v>

2158
01:24:47.831 --> 01:24:49.090
<v Speaker 3>And then he got perfect right before he</v>
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>

2159
01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:52.210
<v Speaker 3>But it's a real sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of that love of trump comes from.</v>

2160
01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:55.570
<v Speaker 3>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's like wanting to spite</v>

2161
01:24:55.571 --> 01:24:56.321
<v Speaker 3>liberals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2162
01:24:56.321 --> 01:24:57.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ha ha ha.</v>

2163
01:24:57.770 --> 01:25:00.430
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't care if trump does</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that's bad for you.</v>

2164
01:25:00.431 --> 01:25:01.960
<v Speaker 3>If it hurts the liberals feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2165
01:25:01.961 --> 01:25:02.794
<v Speaker 3>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2166
01:25:02.810 --> 01:25:05.440
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just want somebody who is hurting</v>

2167
01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:06.590
<v Speaker 3>hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

2168
01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:10.030
<v Speaker 3>Or hurting the liberal you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not about what's good for you</v>

2169
01:25:10.031 --> 01:25:11.320
<v Speaker 3>because if you're looking at what's good</v>
<v Speaker 3>for you,</v>

2170
01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:13.120
<v Speaker 3>this is not good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2171
01:25:13.390 --> 01:25:18.390
<v Speaker 3>well it's also like getting some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a reasonable conservative that would.</v>

2172
01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:22.600
<v Speaker 3>Someone would step up right now would be</v>
<v Speaker 3>very interesting.</v>

2173
01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:26.200
<v Speaker 3>It will be very interesting if you could</v>
<v Speaker 3>find someone who's a reasonable</v>

2174
01:25:26.201 --> 01:25:31.000
<v Speaker 3>conservative who knows how to debate and</v>
<v Speaker 3>conform a sentence and can respond under</v>

2175
01:25:31.001 --> 01:25:36.001
<v Speaker 3>pressure to like what trump also brings</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the table as he's like this ominous</v>

2176
01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:38.240
<v Speaker 3>sort of character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2177
01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:39.130
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2178
01:25:39.130 --> 01:25:40.720
<v Speaker 3>it's like a Mardi gras float that walked</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the.</v>

2179
01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:44.890
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot to.</v>

2180
01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:47.170
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2181
01:25:47.171 --> 01:25:48.550
<v Speaker 3>and I think that the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that,</v>

2182
01:25:48.551 --> 01:25:49.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's all these people who are trying</v>

2183
01:25:49.901 --> 01:25:52.030
<v Speaker 3>to position themselves as the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the trump alternative,</v>

2184
01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:54.130
<v Speaker 3>but then if you dig too deep into their</v>
<v Speaker 3>records,</v>

2185
01:25:54.131 --> 01:25:54.521
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2186
01:25:54.521 --> 01:25:56.290
<v Speaker 3>they really support all the things trump</v>
<v Speaker 3>supports,</v>

2187
01:25:56.291 --> 01:25:59.500
<v Speaker 3>but they're just not out loud racists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

2188
01:25:59.501 --> 01:26:00.334
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

2189
01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:02.230
<v Speaker 3>it's not really like an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not an alternative.</v>

2190
01:26:02.231 --> 01:26:03.064
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think all,</v>

2191
01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:06.890
<v Speaker 3>I think both parties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gotta be you gotta be looking for</v>

2192
01:26:06.891 --> 01:26:09.170
<v Speaker 3>New People.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I feel like I would say like in the</v>

2193
01:26:09.170 --> 01:26:12.050
<v Speaker 3>eighties it felt like the NBA just went</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Africa and grabbed tall people.</v>

2194
01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:15.500
<v Speaker 3>They're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need to find some new people and they</v>

2195
01:26:15.501 --> 01:26:17.120
<v Speaker 3>got the campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but tombow and chemo,</v>

2196
01:26:17.121 --> 01:26:18.920
<v Speaker 3>Elijah won and it's just like they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>

2197
01:26:18.921 --> 01:26:19.580
<v Speaker 3>we need to go.</v>

2198
01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:21.260
<v Speaker 3>And I feel like if I'm the Democratic</v>
<v Speaker 3>Party,</v>

2199
01:26:21.261 --> 01:26:24.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm scouring the United States of</v>
<v Speaker 3>America for people who.</v>

2200
01:26:24.051 --> 01:26:24.860
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's EXP,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2201
01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:26.510
<v Speaker 3>for like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there a city comptroller somewhere</v>

2202
01:26:26.511 --> 01:26:28.940
<v Speaker 3>who's got a good speaking voice?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's go get that.</v>

2203
01:26:28.941 --> 01:26:29.840
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like that's.</v>

2204
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:31.940
<v Speaker 3>You can't be looking at the regular</v>
<v Speaker 3>halls of power.</v>

2205
01:26:32.030 --> 01:26:33.560
<v Speaker 3>Do you watch house of cards?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ideally?</v>

2206
01:26:33.770 --> 01:26:35.600
<v Speaker 3>Do you wonder if that's how it really</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes down?</v>

2207
01:26:36.730 --> 01:26:39.540
<v Speaker 3>I want to know how accurate it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want them was killed.</v>

2208
01:26:40.990 --> 01:26:44.500
<v Speaker 3>I want to know Clayton sensing to feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

2209
01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:47.400
<v Speaker 3>that probably no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2210
01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:51.710
<v Speaker 3>no sen has pushed or representative is</v>
<v Speaker 3>push somebody into a subway train.</v>

2211
01:26:51.711 --> 01:26:54.650
<v Speaker 3>I have to sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spoiler alert season one,</v>

2212
01:26:54.890 --> 01:26:56.210
<v Speaker 3>season two A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2213
01:26:56.211 --> 01:26:59.980
<v Speaker 3>I have to believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do believe all the.</v>

2214
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:01.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think some of it is true.</v>

2215
01:27:01.230 --> 01:27:03.360
<v Speaker 3>Some of it's got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone's got to be based in truth,</v>

2216
01:27:03.410 --> 01:27:05.720
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is I didn't watch this</v>
<v Speaker 3>season of house of cards because I was</v>

2217
01:27:05.721 --> 01:27:06.330
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2218
01:27:06.330 --> 01:27:07.210
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

2219
01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:07.520
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

2220
01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:08.910
<v Speaker 3>I have to be focused on the real</v>
<v Speaker 3>hospital.</v>

2221
01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:10.590
<v Speaker 3>Like I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was watching it like this.</v>

2222
01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:12.830
<v Speaker 3>It didn't land in the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's so good.</v>

2223
01:27:12.831 --> 01:27:13.760
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go back.</v>

2224
01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:15.110
<v Speaker 3>Can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just was like,</v>

2225
01:27:15.111 --> 01:27:17.240
<v Speaker 3>I was watching it thinking like watching</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump tweets.</v>

2226
01:27:17.241 --> 01:27:19.730
<v Speaker 3>Like I couldn't focus on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2227
01:27:19.731 --> 01:27:22.730
<v Speaker 3>it's really bad over here guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder how it's gonna play out.</v>

2228
01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:25.100
<v Speaker 3>Do you think he's gonna make it through</v>
<v Speaker 3>four years in the White House?</v>

2229
01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:28.790
<v Speaker 3>I think we have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those of us who don't think he should</v>

2230
01:27:28.791 --> 01:27:32.240
<v Speaker 3>make it through four years in the White</v>
<v Speaker 3>House or hope that he resigns or gets</v>

2231
01:27:32.241 --> 01:27:33.860
<v Speaker 3>impeached,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't take it for granted.</v>

2232
01:27:33.861 --> 01:27:35.750
<v Speaker 3>That's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we can.</v>

2233
01:27:35.970 --> 01:27:37.550
<v Speaker 3>So is he gonna make it through four</v>
<v Speaker 3>years?</v>

2234
01:27:38.070 --> 01:27:40.700
<v Speaker 3>The history says yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of them do.</v>

2235
01:27:40.701 --> 01:27:41.410
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2236
01:27:41.410 --> 01:27:42.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2237
01:27:42.170 --> 01:27:43.220
<v Speaker 3>there's not a point at which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2238
01:27:43.221 --> 01:27:44.960
<v Speaker 3>it's very the impeach thing.</v>

2239
01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:46.940
<v Speaker 3>And also the impeach thing doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily get you out of the office</v>

2240
01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:47.670
<v Speaker 3>and just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2241
01:27:47.670 --> 01:27:51.470
<v Speaker 3>So I think that a Clinton was impeached.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2242
01:27:51.471 --> 01:27:52.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget.</v>

2243
01:27:52.140 --> 01:27:52.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2244
01:27:52.610 --> 01:27:54.980
<v Speaker 3>it's like it doesn't impeach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't mean you're fired as much as</v>

2245
01:27:54.981 --> 01:27:57.530
<v Speaker 3>we'd like to believe it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's way.</v>

2246
01:27:57.531 --> 01:27:59.330
<v Speaker 3>If I'm in Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's way more likely.</v>

2247
01:27:59.331 --> 01:28:01.000
<v Speaker 3>It's like the floyd mayweather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mcgregor odds.</v>

2248
01:28:01.340 --> 01:28:03.920
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's way more the bet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bet that he makes it through.</v>

2249
01:28:04.390 --> 01:28:05.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that there's.</v>

2250
01:28:06.030 --> 01:28:08.330
<v Speaker 3>Things are already off the rails,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't think we can go.</v>

2251
01:28:08.331 --> 01:28:09.680
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clearly he's spooky.</v>

2252
01:28:09.681 --> 01:28:12.470
<v Speaker 3>Thing is a second term.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's.</v>

2253
01:28:12.471 --> 01:28:15.680
<v Speaker 3>I think the reality is that after four</v>
<v Speaker 3>years I visited,</v>

2254
01:28:15.681 --> 01:28:18.920
<v Speaker 3>think if he does leslie for years that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gets to the end of four years,</v>

2255
01:28:19.140 --> 01:28:23.150
<v Speaker 3>I</v>
<v Speaker 3>felt like this is really hurting.</v>

2256
01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:26.190
<v Speaker 3>It's also if it's because it's hurting</v>
<v Speaker 3>his business brands,</v>

2257
01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:27.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he's like,</v>

2258
01:28:27.231 --> 01:28:29.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are canceling hotel reservations</v>

2259
01:28:29.121 --> 01:28:32.410
<v Speaker 3>and like I think of the pcs is bottom</v>
<v Speaker 3>line going down instead of going up,</v>

2260
01:28:32.490 --> 01:28:33.880
<v Speaker 3>is it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've,</v>

2261
01:28:33.890 --> 01:28:35.470
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard that like a bunch of people</v>

2262
01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:37.910
<v Speaker 3>pulled out reservations from Mar Lago</v>
<v Speaker 3>and things like that.</v>

2263
01:28:37.911 --> 01:28:41.630
<v Speaker 3>So they take the name off of one of his</v>
<v Speaker 3>buildings in downtown New York.</v>

2264
01:28:41.631 --> 01:28:43.670
<v Speaker 3>That makes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I can you do that?</v>

2265
01:28:43.690 --> 01:28:47.300
<v Speaker 3>Is it a condo?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think they decided to take the name</v>

2266
01:28:47.301 --> 01:28:49.610
<v Speaker 3>off one of the war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does not say.</v>

2267
01:28:49.611 --> 01:28:51.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people weren't buying condos.</v>

2268
01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:53.900
<v Speaker 3>Didn't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2269
01:28:53.930 --> 01:28:56.510
<v Speaker 3>It's like that story made off business</v>
<v Speaker 3>management.</v>

2270
01:28:56.630 --> 01:29:00.510
<v Speaker 3>That's a good idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2271
01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:01.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I do</v>

2272
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:03.720
<v Speaker 2>think that like if it's effect really</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] like you know,</v>

2273
01:29:03.721 --> 01:29:06.510
<v Speaker 2>it certainly has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's reports that have like Ivanka is</v>

2274
01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:07.670
<v Speaker 2>brands are down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2275
01:29:07.671 --> 01:29:10.230
<v Speaker 2>like the thing are not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They thought this is going to help that</v>

2276
01:29:10.231 --> 01:29:13.800
<v Speaker 2>stuff and if it's not helping that stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>and at the end of four years and it's</v>

2277
01:29:13.820 --> 01:29:14.970
<v Speaker 2>Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he could leave because he's</v>

2278
01:29:14.971 --> 01:29:17.610
<v Speaker 2>annoyed by it all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he'll have some big speech about I</v>

2279
01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:20.670
<v Speaker 2>have done what I came to do and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've really drained this.</v>

2280
01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:22.740
<v Speaker 2>We'll just say he did and his people</v>
<v Speaker 2>will be like,</v>

2281
01:29:22.741 --> 01:29:24.060
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2282
01:29:24.410 --> 01:29:28.080
<v Speaker 2>talk about how unemployment was at his</v>
<v Speaker 2>lowest rate in 15 years.</v>

2283
01:29:28.110 --> 01:29:32.610
<v Speaker 2>Even though the arc that unemployment is</v>
<v Speaker 2>on as the same like arc that it's been</v>

2284
01:29:32.611 --> 01:29:36.510
<v Speaker 2>on anime arcs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's all go to the same path that it</v>

2285
01:29:36.511 --> 01:29:37.680
<v Speaker 2>was always there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always been on.</v>

2286
01:29:37.830 --> 01:29:40.800
<v Speaker 2>I think there was some initial</v>
<v Speaker 2>speculation that he was going to be good</v>

2287
01:29:40.801 --> 01:29:44.660
<v Speaker 2>for business and then there was some</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a rise and that is,</v>

2288
01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:45.810
<v Speaker 2>is that all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's important.</v>

2289
01:29:45.870 --> 01:29:49.710
<v Speaker 2>It's good for business trump name to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>removed from three Manhattan apartment</v>

2290
01:29:49.711 --> 01:29:50.970
<v Speaker 2>buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't own.</v>

2291
01:29:51.210 --> 01:29:52.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't own them.</v>

2292
01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:53.790
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he sells.</v>

2293
01:29:54.090 --> 01:29:56.560
<v Speaker 2>He sells his name a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He people think he owns more than young.</v>

2294
01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:57.433
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2295
01:29:57.850 --> 01:30:01.410
<v Speaker 2>There've been owned by a Chicago based</v>
<v Speaker 2>real estate equity from a,</v>

2296
01:30:01.730 --> 01:30:03.140
<v Speaker 2>from Ra residential,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2297
01:30:03.210 --> 01:30:06.690
<v Speaker 2>equity residential since 2005 now trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

2298
01:30:06.691 --> 01:30:11.691
<v Speaker 2>So they'll remain on the condominium</v>
<v Speaker 2>buildings 200 to 20 to 40 Riverside</v>

2299
01:30:13.110 --> 01:30:14.310
<v Speaker 2>Boulevard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which neither equity,</v>

2300
01:30:14.311 --> 01:30:17.400
<v Speaker 2>residential nor trump on how weird for</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2301
01:30:17.490 --> 01:30:18.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to remove it though,</v>

2302
01:30:19.050 --> 01:30:20.280
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2303
01:30:20.281 --> 01:30:22.890
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it was he was selling his name</v>
<v Speaker 2>to stuff or licensed because name of</v>

2304
01:30:22.891 --> 01:30:23.150
<v Speaker 2>this stuff.</v>

2305
01:30:23.150 --> 01:30:25.230
<v Speaker 2>So it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People thought he had more than he had,</v>

2306
01:30:25.231 --> 01:30:27.270
<v Speaker 2>which is why he doesn't show his tax</v>
<v Speaker 2>returns because it's like,</v>

2307
01:30:27.271 --> 01:30:29.280
<v Speaker 2>it's not as a it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2308
01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:31.470
<v Speaker 2>how weird is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does he doesn't show his tax return.</v>

2309
01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:34.860
<v Speaker 2>The rules are different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rules are different for,</v>

2310
01:30:34.861 --> 01:30:35.694
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

2311
01:30:35.700 --> 01:30:37.710
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for rich white men.</v>

2312
01:30:37.711 --> 01:30:38.960
<v Speaker 2>The rules are different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But is that,</v>

2313
01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:43.290
<v Speaker 2>is that like a mandatory thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because now it's obviously not,</v>

2314
01:30:43.291 --> 01:30:45.450
<v Speaker 2>it's not a legal thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just what has been done.</v>

2315
01:30:45.451 --> 01:30:47.560
<v Speaker 2>And the problem is again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there may,</v>

2316
01:30:47.610 --> 01:30:49.650
<v Speaker 2>they may make it after trump that it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal thing.</v>

2317
01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:51.960
<v Speaker 2>All these things were sort of like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the president,</v>

2318
01:30:52.450 --> 01:30:54.750
<v Speaker 2>just what had been done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what people assumed would always be</v>

2319
01:30:54.751 --> 01:30:55.590
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then trump,</v>

2320
01:30:56.280 --> 01:30:58.930
<v Speaker 2>the one shining grace of trump is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it proved it,</v>

2321
01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:04.020
<v Speaker 2>that it exposes how that stuff isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's we think there's more that it's</v>

2322
01:31:04.201 --> 01:31:07.050
<v Speaker 2>more complicated to become the president</v>
<v Speaker 2>and more complicated to be the president</v>

2323
01:31:07.051 --> 01:31:09.090
<v Speaker 2>and that there's more restraints on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>president than there actually are.</v>

2324
01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:12.030
<v Speaker 2>So now that we know that maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when trump leaves,</v>

2325
01:31:12.031 --> 01:31:14.070
<v Speaker 2>eventually I think it's forgetting</v>
<v Speaker 2>Republicans,</v>

2326
01:31:14.071 --> 01:31:16.950
<v Speaker 2>Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's on the benefit of humanity for the</v>

2327
01:31:16.951 --> 01:31:20.320
<v Speaker 2>benefit for the entire world that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>president doesn't have the,</v>

2328
01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:22.650
<v Speaker 2>they can't launch nukes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just,</v>

2329
01:31:22.830 --> 01:31:24.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm not making this a Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a democrat.</v>

2330
01:31:24.151 --> 01:31:24.680
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2331
01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:26.490
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should be a couple more people than</v>

2332
01:31:26.491 --> 01:31:29.280
<v Speaker 2>just one guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or what about pardoning people that are</v>

2333
01:31:29.281 --> 01:31:30.980
<v Speaker 2>criminals?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how again,</v>

2334
01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:32.850
<v Speaker 2>is that the case?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you have laws,</v>

2335
01:31:33.210 --> 01:31:38.210
<v Speaker 2>but then you have a president who</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently can't be charged with laws or</v>

2336
01:31:38.371 --> 01:31:39.740
<v Speaker 2>can't be charged with crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2337
01:31:39.930 --> 01:31:42.000
<v Speaker 2>Which is why these women that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to sue him,</v>

2338
01:31:42.001 --> 01:31:44.910
<v Speaker 2>they can't do anything about it now that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the president has that would happen</v>

2339
01:31:44.911 --> 01:31:45.880
<v Speaker 2>because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2340
01:31:46.620 --> 01:31:48.660
<v Speaker 2>he can't really do what I'm saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it gets in the way.</v>

2341
01:31:49.110 --> 01:31:52.800
<v Speaker 2>That's the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>the unemployment line is going up.</v>

2342
01:31:52.801 --> 01:31:55.440
<v Speaker 2>We can't really deal with women who say</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were harassed is.</v>

2343
01:31:55.470 --> 01:31:57.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what when these women</v>

2344
01:31:57.601 --> 01:32:00.210
<v Speaker 2>were trying to sue him when he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>running for president,</v>

2345
01:32:00.230 --> 01:32:02.080
<v Speaker 3>I think he got rid of all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2346
01:32:02.081 --> 01:32:02.681
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was.</v>

2347
01:32:02.681 --> 01:32:03.371
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2348
01:32:03.371 --> 01:32:04.360
<v Speaker 3>I should google that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

2349
01:32:04.361 --> 01:32:05.340
<v Speaker 3>that would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2350
01:32:05.410 --> 01:32:06.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you pardon himself?</v>

2351
01:32:06.851 --> 01:32:08.260
<v Speaker 3>How does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>

2352
01:32:08.261 --> 01:32:09.610
<v Speaker 3>People don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like this weird.</v>

2353
01:32:09.611 --> 01:32:11.340
<v Speaker 3>There's all this stuff that happens in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the law where they're like,</v>

2354
01:32:11.350 --> 01:32:13.870
<v Speaker 3>we've never actually asked that question</v>
<v Speaker 3>because nobody thought that was a</v>

2355
01:32:13.871 --> 01:32:16.900
<v Speaker 3>question that you'd be asked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like nobody ever thought that a</v>

2356
01:32:16.901 --> 01:32:18.670
<v Speaker 3>president would think to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2357
01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:21.280
<v Speaker 3>So there's all these sorts of things</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it's like there's no,</v>

2358
01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:22.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would,</v>

2359
01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:24.850
<v Speaker 3>he could sign a thing and then the</v>
<v Speaker 3>supreme court would have to be like,</v>

2360
01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:26.620
<v Speaker 3>is this okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this okay?</v>

2361
01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:28.500
<v Speaker 3>You get a number of pardons too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2362
01:32:28.510 --> 01:32:30.040
<v Speaker 3>Don't they get like 20 or something like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

2363
01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:31.340
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think.</v>

2364
01:32:31.340 --> 01:32:31.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2365
01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:35.080
<v Speaker 3>I think they have a limited number</v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

2366
01:32:35.110 --> 01:32:38.450
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a limited number of</v>
<v Speaker 3>senior.</v>

2367
01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:40.370
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got 50 letters.</v>

2368
01:32:41.470 --> 01:32:43.570
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're playing a game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

2369
01:32:43.630 --> 01:32:46.190
<v Speaker 3>Where do I go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where do I go with these pardons?</v>

2370
01:32:46.250 --> 01:32:48.220
<v Speaker 3>And now after he did a pile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the,</v>

2371
01:32:48.221 --> 01:32:49.054
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2372
01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:53.320
<v Speaker 3>it's even mccain freaked out about our</v>
<v Speaker 3>pile canes from Arizona and he knows,</v>

2373
01:32:53.610 --> 01:32:55.400
<v Speaker 3>he knows our piles of criminal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2374
01:32:55.570 --> 01:32:58.270
<v Speaker 3>Now the question is why didn't you do</v>
<v Speaker 3>something about it before mccain?</v>

2375
01:32:58.300 --> 01:33:00.430
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have any jurisdiction in that</v>

2376
01:33:00.431 --> 01:33:02.440
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you could have been used or bully</v>

2377
01:33:02.441 --> 01:33:05.500
<v Speaker 3>pulpit more effectively if you thought</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a criminal before this,</v>

2378
01:33:05.610 --> 01:33:07.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mccain's defense.</v>

2379
01:33:07.031 --> 01:33:08.650
<v Speaker 3>He had a brain tumor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean now.</v>

2380
01:33:08.651 --> 01:33:13.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean I didn't even ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how many do Obama.</v>

2381
01:33:13.310 --> 01:33:15.310
<v Speaker 3>This is a list.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just scrolling down.</v>

2382
01:33:15.311 --> 01:33:18.220
<v Speaker 3>It goes forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hundreds.</v>

2383
01:33:18.730 --> 01:33:19.550
<v Speaker 3>Hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2384
01:33:19.550 --> 01:33:21.700
<v Speaker 3>And Obama didn't do the most.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to be clear but.</v>

2385
01:33:21.710 --> 01:33:22.990
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there.</v>

2386
01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:25.990
<v Speaker 3>Is there a limit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it say how many confer limit?</v>

2387
01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.690
<v Speaker 3>This is justice dot Gov website.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's a limit.</v>

2388
01:33:28.900 --> 01:33:31.690
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He pardons are so weird.</v>

2389
01:33:32.190 --> 01:33:33.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you're a criminal,</v>

2390
01:33:33.581 --> 01:33:37.480
<v Speaker 3>but magic there is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the part of it that should be</v>

2391
01:33:37.481 --> 01:33:39.970
<v Speaker 3>good is there are many people who are in</v>
<v Speaker 3>prison again,</v>

2392
01:33:39.971 --> 01:33:43.900
<v Speaker 3>like we talked about earlier for things</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you like the rest of your life.</v>

2393
01:33:43.930 --> 01:33:44.500
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2394
01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:48.340
<v Speaker 3>so there is a good side to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we thought that they would only be.</v>

2395
01:33:48.630 --> 01:33:51.290
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times it's like friends and</v>
<v Speaker 3>colleagues and you know,</v>

2396
01:33:51.550 --> 01:33:54.040
<v Speaker 3>the way I would pardon people like</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bradley Manning,</v>

2397
01:33:54.041 --> 01:33:56.610
<v Speaker 3>Chelsea manning thing pardoned her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2398
01:33:56.650 --> 01:33:57.101
<v Speaker 3>That wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2399
01:33:57.101 --> 01:33:58.960
<v Speaker 3>That was an example of you have served.</v>

2400
01:33:59.170 --> 01:34:01.690
<v Speaker 3>Obama was like you have served more than</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough time.</v>

2401
01:34:01.710 --> 01:34:03.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two hundred and 12 people,</v>

2402
01:34:03.670 --> 01:34:05.500
<v Speaker 3>but that's not the most.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the.</v>

2403
01:34:06.180 --> 01:34:07.310
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2404
01:34:07.370 --> 01:34:12.370
<v Speaker 3>and commuted the convictions of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>further 1,715 people hillbillies.</v>

2405
01:34:12.420 --> 01:34:14.800
<v Speaker 3>She had the thing where he went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he actually went to federal prison and</v>

2406
01:34:14.801 --> 01:34:17.890
<v Speaker 3>talk to inmates and it was all</v>
<v Speaker 3>nonviolent people.</v>

2407
01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:19.010
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same thing.</v>

2408
01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:21.340
<v Speaker 3>People who have been convicted of</v>
<v Speaker 3>nonviolent crimes who were just</v>

2409
01:34:21.341 --> 01:34:22.900
<v Speaker 3>languishing in prison for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2410
01:34:22.980 --> 01:34:26.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he smoked a lot of weed and sold a lot</v>

2411
01:34:26.411 --> 01:34:28.690
<v Speaker 3>of weed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you've been here for 30 years,</v>

2412
01:34:28.810 --> 01:34:29.800
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2413
01:34:30.010 --> 01:34:30.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of,</v>

2414
01:34:30.610 --> 01:34:33.430
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most granted clemency by Obama had been</v>

2415
01:34:33.431 --> 01:34:37.030
<v Speaker 3>convicted on drug charges.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never receive lengthy and sometimes</v>

2416
01:34:37.031 --> 01:34:39.460
<v Speaker 3>mandatory sentences at the height of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>war on drugs.</v>

2417
01:34:40.420 --> 01:34:42.880
<v Speaker 3>That's the scariest thing about that</v>
<v Speaker 3>jeff sessions asshole.</v>

2418
01:34:42.881 --> 01:34:44.710
<v Speaker 3>He wanted to bring that stuff back and</v>
<v Speaker 3>bring back.</v>

2419
01:34:44.711 --> 01:34:47.650
<v Speaker 3>Just say no and start arresting people</v>
<v Speaker 3>for pot.</v>

2420
01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:48.670
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on man.</v>

2421
01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:51.190
<v Speaker 3>It's 2017.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got to catch up.</v>

2422
01:34:51.220 --> 01:34:51.491
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2423
01:34:51.491 --> 01:34:53.320
<v Speaker 3>we got and we were about to catch up and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were,</v>

2424
01:34:53.321 --> 01:34:55.210
<v Speaker 3>we were getting close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That will now we're getting,</v>

2425
01:34:55.211 --> 01:34:56.100
<v Speaker 3>we're getting close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>

2426
01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:58.010
<v Speaker 3>because I feel like</v>

2427
01:34:58.010 --> 01:35:01.910
<v Speaker 2>even if you had a 45 year old republican</v>
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>

2428
01:35:02.900 --> 01:35:05.990
<v Speaker 2>they would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would be more open to things than</v>

2429
01:35:05.991 --> 01:35:07.270
<v Speaker 2>the 71 year old trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2430
01:35:07.271 --> 01:35:10.670
<v Speaker 2>are they are any 71 year old republican</v>
<v Speaker 2>or Democrat just by the nature of the</v>

2431
01:35:10.671 --> 01:35:14.150
<v Speaker 2>fact that like for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>45 year old Republicans don't care about</v>

2432
01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:16.880
<v Speaker 2>where people go to the bathroom as long</v>
<v Speaker 2>as they,</v>

2433
01:35:16.881 --> 01:35:19.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old people shouldn't be running shit.</v>

2434
01:35:20.110 --> 01:35:22.130
<v Speaker 2>I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did this job briefly but it didn't,</v>

2435
01:35:22.190 --> 01:35:24.620
<v Speaker 2>I didn't stick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was eddie like you can be too</v>

2436
01:35:24.621 --> 01:35:26.810
<v Speaker 2>young to vote and you can also be too</v>
<v Speaker 2>old to vote.</v>

2437
01:35:28.190 --> 01:35:29.890
<v Speaker 2>The idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2438
01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:33.560
<v Speaker 2>That like there's a point at which</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a part of life where you were in</v>

2439
01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:36.380
<v Speaker 2>the world doing things and you're in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mix and there's a part where you're sort</v>

2440
01:35:36.381 --> 01:35:37.300
<v Speaker 2>of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2441
01:35:37.350 --> 01:35:38.061
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2442
01:35:38.061 --> 01:35:39.050
<v Speaker 2>I think well at least we should.</v>

2443
01:35:39.530 --> 01:35:41.410
<v Speaker 2>We should do some checks first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2444
01:35:41.420 --> 01:35:42.140
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

2445
01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:43.240
<v Speaker 2>Can you do a cartwheel?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2446
01:35:44.210 --> 01:35:45.043
<v Speaker 2>Can you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2447
01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:47.580
<v Speaker 2>Can you walk a straight line?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I like how,</v>

2448
01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:51.890
<v Speaker 2>how well does your body doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make sense that it would be</v>

2449
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:54.440
<v Speaker 2>the oldest person to be the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make.</v>

2450
01:35:54.770 --> 01:35:56.030
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>

2451
01:35:56.031 --> 01:35:58.760
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's an incredibly wise old person</v>

2452
01:35:58.761 --> 01:36:03.680
<v Speaker 2>who's like learned a bunch of things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>has control of their ego and as a person</v>

2453
01:36:03.681 --> 01:36:05.300
<v Speaker 2>who really wants to make the world a</v>
<v Speaker 2>better place,</v>

2454
01:36:05.330 --> 01:36:09.620
<v Speaker 2>but it's also awesome hgh so they can</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually do this live up to the rigors</v>

2455
01:36:09.621 --> 01:36:10.640
<v Speaker 2>of the job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2456
01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:11.870
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that was.</v>

2457
01:36:11.930 --> 01:36:14.930
<v Speaker 2>What did you read about Obama?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Obama,</v>

2458
01:36:14.931 --> 01:36:17.030
<v Speaker 2>about people thinking that trump's on</v>
<v Speaker 2>stimulants.</v>

2459
01:36:17.190 --> 01:36:20.330
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't remember where I saw it from</v>
<v Speaker 2>because when I looked back up,</v>

2460
01:36:20.331 --> 01:36:22.790
<v Speaker 2>like that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no real history of him using</v>

2461
01:36:22.791 --> 01:36:23.460
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>

2462
01:36:23.460 --> 01:36:25.790
<v Speaker 2>People.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had rumors that maybe he was doing</v>

2463
01:36:25.791 --> 01:36:28.190
<v Speaker 2>like phen phen and whatnot in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>eighties or something like that.</v>

2464
01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:31.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder where the guy gets the energy.</v>

2465
01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:34.070
<v Speaker 2>Like when he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was doing that whole thing with</v>

2466
01:36:34.071 --> 01:36:36.830
<v Speaker 2>Hillary and then it was revealed that a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hillary,</v>

2467
01:36:36.890 --> 01:36:40.310
<v Speaker 2>when they were running for president was</v>
<v Speaker 2>on new vigil or provigil,</v>

2468
01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:41.300
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2469
01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:45.290
<v Speaker 2>a narcolepsy drug say give it to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter pilots to keep them awake.</v>

2470
01:36:45.740 --> 01:36:49.390
<v Speaker 2>I've taken it before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting because she actually on</v>

2471
01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:49.671
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2472
01:36:49.671 --> 01:36:51.770
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of people take that stuff.</v>

2473
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:55.580
<v Speaker 2>And what it does is it kind of keeps you</v>
<v Speaker 2>awake and it keeps you alert.</v>

2474
01:36:55.700 --> 01:36:58.100
<v Speaker 2>Even if you start getting tired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it keeps you from falling asleep,</v>

2475
01:36:58.370 --> 01:37:00.160
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't change it from up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>

2476
01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:03.530
<v Speaker 2>not at a press conference or it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>speed you up.</v>

2477
01:37:03.531 --> 01:37:05.270
<v Speaker 2>Which is interesting because it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2478
01:37:05.300 --> 01:37:07.310
<v Speaker 2>it's not like tweaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2479
01:37:07.340 --> 01:37:08.690
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a,</v>

2480
01:37:08.780 --> 01:37:10.760
<v Speaker 2>an amphetamine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's some weird thing.</v>

2481
01:37:10.830 --> 01:37:13.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was essentially originally created as</v>

2482
01:37:13.191 --> 01:37:16.660
<v Speaker 2>a performance enhancing drug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they needed some sort of a,</v>

2483
01:37:16.750 --> 01:37:19.190
<v Speaker 2>a reason to medically prescribed it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2484
01:37:19.191 --> 01:37:21.080
<v Speaker 2>So they want a narcolepsy.</v>

2485
01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:26.180
<v Speaker 2>Narcolepsy is found it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2486
01:37:26.620 --> 01:37:29.300
<v Speaker 2>What do you got here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But is it legitimate?</v>

2487
01:37:29.730 --> 01:37:32.720
<v Speaker 2>Is actual truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But MSNBC,</v>

2503
01:38:07.471 --> 01:38:10.470
<v Speaker 2>metabolic imbalance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we have never heard about again.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Greenberg was later publicly shamed</v>
<v Speaker 2>sham.</v>

<v Speaker 2>As someone who provides uppers to rich</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in Manhattan and medical</v>

2507
01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:23.270
<v Speaker 2>metabolic imbalance of true could be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>or electrolyte info.</v>

2508
01:38:23.310 --> 01:38:27.090
<v Speaker 2>Insufficiencies anaerobic and balances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>acid imbalances and assortment of</v>

2509
01:38:27.091 --> 01:38:30.030
<v Speaker 2>related disorders that can have serious</v>
<v Speaker 2>health consequences.</v>

2510
01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:35.240
<v Speaker 2>Yet his other doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Harold Bernstein Bernstein said he</v>

2511
01:38:35.791 --> 01:38:40.530
<v Speaker 2>had been trump's dr since 1980 and never</v>
<v Speaker 2>mentioned the metabolic imbalance found</v>

2512
01:38:40.531 --> 01:38:42.120
<v Speaker 2>by Greenberg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's he know this though?</v>

2513
01:38:42.490 --> 01:38:44.980
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to Kinda like reading a</v>
<v Speaker 2>book and doing research.</v>

2514
01:38:44.990 --> 01:38:48.390
<v Speaker 2>So you've got to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's a,</v>

2515
01:38:48.391 --> 01:38:49.490
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

2516
01:38:50.590 --> 01:38:52.620
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a legit journalist,</v>

2517
01:38:52.621 --> 01:38:54.130
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes you do have to eat.</v>

2518
01:38:54.540 --> 01:38:57.270
<v Speaker 2>But he also certainly opening himself</v>
<v Speaker 2>with being sued if it's not true.</v>

2519
01:38:57.271 --> 01:38:59.490
<v Speaker 2>So you always kind of be sued if it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

2520
01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:03.000
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that would make sense because if</v>

2521
01:39:03.001 --> 01:39:05.430
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you see like how much energy he had</v>

2522
01:39:05.431 --> 01:39:07.920
<v Speaker 2>when he was running,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing the campaign against Hillary.</v>

2523
01:39:08.220 --> 01:39:09.750
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy never got tired.</v>

2524
01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:13.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he would go up there to the White</v>

2525
01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:15.350
<v Speaker 2>House,</v>
<v Speaker 2>admitted it to me,</v>

2526
01:39:15.570 --> 01:39:19.890
<v Speaker 2>said only for a short time for diet when</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was not overweight.</v>

2527
01:39:20.310 --> 01:39:25.310
<v Speaker 2>I countered with Med records.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They cut me off people misreading drug</v>

2528
01:39:25.621 --> 01:39:29.670
<v Speaker 2>was di Etho got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got the Duane Reed in Manhattan</v>

2529
01:39:29.671 --> 01:39:32.460
<v Speaker 2>where it was filled at seven milligrams</v>
<v Speaker 2>a day.</v>

2530
01:39:32.461 --> 01:39:35.550
<v Speaker 2>Prescription filled at Duane reed on</v>
<v Speaker 2>57th street in Manhattan.</v>

2531
01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:39.810
<v Speaker 2>Seventy 5 million other things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seventy five milligrams a day,</v>

2532
01:39:40.060 --> 01:39:42.330
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2533
01:39:42.331 --> 01:39:44.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that is though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's,</v>

2534
01:39:44.510 --> 01:39:45.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean he certainly is right in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

2535
01:39:45.940 --> 01:39:46.820
<v Speaker 2>He's apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2536
01:39:46.821 --> 01:39:48.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's interesting.</v>

2537
01:39:48.090 --> 01:39:50.130
<v Speaker 2>He's certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that would make sense.</v>

2538
01:39:50.190 --> 01:39:51.960
<v Speaker 2>That would make sense why he has this</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of energy.</v>

2539
01:39:51.961 --> 01:39:56.961
<v Speaker 2>I know so many journalists that are on</v>
<v Speaker 2>adderall and I have a friend who told me</v>

2540
01:39:58.261 --> 01:39:59.450
<v Speaker 2>that they're all on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2541
01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:00.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that means.</v>

2542
01:40:00.430 --> 01:40:03.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean 80 percent 60,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does it mean?</v>

2543
01:40:03.510 --> 01:40:04.590
<v Speaker 2>But he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen man,</v>

2544
01:40:04.650 --> 01:40:07.050
<v Speaker 2>they're all on adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was one of the things that when</v>

2545
01:40:07.620 --> 01:40:08.453
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>

2546
01:40:08.460 --> 01:40:09.690
<v Speaker 2>What was his name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That uh,</v>

2547
01:40:09.980 --> 01:40:14.190
<v Speaker 2>that guy that I'm crashed his car under</v>
<v Speaker 2>suspicious.</v>

2548
01:40:14.370 --> 01:40:16.050
<v Speaker 2>Suspicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Hastings.</v>

2549
01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:18.570
<v Speaker 2>Remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crashed his car under suspicious</v>

2550
01:40:18.571 --> 01:40:19.560
<v Speaker 2>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>

2551
01:40:19.590 --> 01:40:21.720
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this guy had meth in his died yet</v>

2552
01:40:21.730 --> 01:40:24.960
<v Speaker 2>amphetamines in his blood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was probably fucked up on pills.</v>

2553
01:40:25.070 --> 01:40:26.800
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's probably a fucking journalist.</v>

2554
01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:28.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all on amphetamines.</v>

2555
01:40:28.741 --> 01:40:29.231
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2556
01:40:29.231 --> 01:40:31.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what adderall is,</v>

2557
01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:34.410
<v Speaker 2>a prescription amphetamine that you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>get if he's like,</v>

2558
01:40:34.411 --> 01:40:36.240
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been kind of dragging ass lately</v>

2559
01:40:36.350 --> 01:40:40.110
<v Speaker 2>when</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr says never had that doctor.</v>

2560
01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:43.320
<v Speaker 2>I've had the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been dragging ass lately.</v>

2561
01:40:43.321 --> 01:40:44.970
<v Speaker 2>You should probably exercise and get</v>
<v Speaker 2>more arrests.</v>

2562
01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:50.680
<v Speaker 2>This motherfucker's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

2563
01:40:50.700 --> 01:40:52.680
<v Speaker 2>But isn't there other things you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>do?</v>

2564
01:40:53.300 --> 01:40:54.040
<v Speaker 2>What I</v>

2565
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:56.390
<v Speaker 3>needed to ask about these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

2566
01:40:56.410 --> 01:41:00.850
<v Speaker 3>I got back pain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm always tired,</v>

2567
01:41:02.570 --> 01:41:05.470
<v Speaker 3>stressed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>suited my back pain and I want to float</v>

2568
01:41:05.471 --> 01:41:08.740
<v Speaker 3>through life with not a care in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world so I can take care of my family</v>

2569
01:41:08.741 --> 01:41:09.574
<v Speaker 3>business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2570
01:41:09.790 --> 01:41:11.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm really stressed out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to organize your day better</v>

2571
01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:18.710
<v Speaker 3>or that's not what I was looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like to talk to a therapist.</v>

2572
01:41:21.690 --> 01:41:25.340
<v Speaker 3>We got to get someone like Elon Musk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got to get like some super genius.</v>

2573
01:41:25.341 --> 01:41:27.490
<v Speaker 3>She seems to be able to do everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's the thing.</v>

2574
01:41:27.610 --> 01:41:31.390
<v Speaker 3>The other sort of good side of this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it is certainly opened up the</v>

2575
01:41:31.391 --> 01:41:32.860
<v Speaker 3>possibilities of who can be the</v>
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>

2576
01:41:33.270 --> 01:41:38.020
<v Speaker 3>Like it is completely blown now will</v>
<v Speaker 3>some person who's not a Republican,</v>

2577
01:41:38.021 --> 01:41:39.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like step through like Lilla liberal</v>

2578
01:41:39.851 --> 01:41:42.370
<v Speaker 3>step through that will the Democratic</v>
<v Speaker 3>Party support that person because you</v>

2579
01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:44.170
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hear like the rocket might run for</v>

2580
01:41:44.171 --> 01:41:44.650
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>

2581
01:41:44.650 --> 01:41:49.050
<v Speaker 3>He was gonna probably do it while he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>working out on a</v>

2582
01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:53.230
<v Speaker 3>talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He live streaming has run for president.</v>

2583
01:41:53.231 --> 01:41:53.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2584
01:41:53.730 --> 01:41:55.360
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the Democratic Party might be like,</v>

2585
01:41:56.290 --> 01:41:58.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are they going to get behind that kind</v>

2586
01:41:58.091 --> 01:41:58.900
<v Speaker 3>of person?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2587
01:41:58.900 --> 01:42:03.010
<v Speaker 3>they don't have a fucking choice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a rock to rock decides to run</v>

2588
01:42:03.011 --> 01:42:04.930
<v Speaker 3>for president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll fucking help them out of the</v>

2589
01:42:04.931 --> 01:42:06.670
<v Speaker 3>finding is people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't even know that the rock is a</v>

2590
01:42:06.671 --> 01:42:08.080
<v Speaker 3>democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what.</v>

2591
01:42:08.081 --> 01:42:10.600
<v Speaker 3>He's not a guy who has declared his</v>
<v Speaker 3>political affiliation.</v>

2592
01:42:10.601 --> 01:42:11.900
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's a,</v>

2593
01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:13.840
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a rich guy.</v>

2594
01:42:13.910 --> 01:42:15.450
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true too.</v>

2595
01:42:15.570 --> 01:42:16.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's so rich.</v>

2596
01:42:16.961 --> 01:42:19.120
<v Speaker 3>He probably doesn't even notice his</v>
<v Speaker 3>taxes.</v>

2597
01:42:19.150 --> 01:42:22.690
<v Speaker 3>That's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Moroccans hit that elite</v>

2598
01:42:22.691 --> 01:42:26.080
<v Speaker 3>stratosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like feel like $3,</v>

2599
01:42:26.081 --> 01:42:27.730
<v Speaker 3>million more for taxis.</v>

2600
01:42:27.731 --> 01:42:32.340
<v Speaker 3>fuck I gotta lift weights or you father</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to get to my pump on over here</v>

2601
01:42:32.950 --> 01:42:33.360
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

2602
01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:35.380
<v Speaker 3>Let's move on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Less depressing shed because I want to</v>

2603
01:42:35.381 --> 01:42:39.020
<v Speaker 3>talk about some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to talk about your show and what,</v>

2604
01:42:39.030 --> 01:42:40.510
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what has this been like for you?</v>

2605
01:42:40.511 --> 01:42:45.070
<v Speaker 3>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your show is a very unique show on CNN</v>

2606
01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:47.650
<v Speaker 3>and it seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

2607
01:42:47.651 --> 01:42:50.470
<v Speaker 3>but it seems like you have a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>creative leeway.</v>

2608
01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:51.393
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2609
01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:53.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean it seems like you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2610
01:42:53.561 --> 01:42:55.780
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing about the show that has</v>
<v Speaker 3>been such a,</v>

2611
01:42:56.260 --> 01:42:57.570
<v Speaker 3>it's been so cool because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2612
01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:00.640
<v Speaker 3>I've had a career where I was like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of in the trenches,</v>

2613
01:43:00.690 --> 01:43:01.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2614
01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:04.120
<v Speaker 3>for a long time just trying to figure it</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and didn't think I'd ever get this</v>

2615
01:43:04.121 --> 01:43:06.610
<v Speaker 3>opportunity in the way that I got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was not some way that made any</v>

2616
01:43:06.611 --> 01:43:08.290
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now I sit in a room.</v>

2617
01:43:08.291 --> 01:43:10.420
<v Speaker 3>I just had a kickoff meeting yesterday</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a room full of people,</v>

2618
01:43:10.421 --> 01:43:11.290
<v Speaker 3>like what do you want to do?</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2620
01:43:12.161 --> 01:43:16.870
<v Speaker 3>and it's like I feel super a Hashtag</v>
<v Speaker 3>blessed to be in that position</v>

2621
01:43:19.350 --> 01:43:21.670
<v Speaker 3>because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was not something that five years ago</v>

2622
01:43:21.671 --> 01:43:22.300
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2623
01:43:22.300 --> 01:43:24.790
<v Speaker 3>probably end up seeing it and also to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>at CNN that wasn't.</v>

2624
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:27.550
<v Speaker 3>None of these things were on my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how did it happen?</v>

2625
01:43:27.950 --> 01:43:30.580
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so after my show totally biased that</v>

2626
01:43:30.610 --> 01:43:32.810
<v Speaker 3>Chris had executive produced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

2627
01:43:32.980 --> 01:43:34.570
<v Speaker 3>didn't have a job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't know what I was going to do.</v>

2628
01:43:34.571 --> 01:43:39.571
<v Speaker 3>We in New York and that was on fx and fx</v>
<v Speaker 3>and fx x and then get the Fx Outta here.</v>

2629
01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:42.280
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was on,</v>

2630
01:43:42.580 --> 01:43:43.720
<v Speaker 3>it was on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was on Fx.</v>

2631
01:43:43.721 --> 01:43:47.020
<v Speaker 3>Now fx is legit channel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we might show helped launch fx and</v>

2632
01:43:47.021 --> 01:43:48.730
<v Speaker 3>didn't do a good job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's why the show got canceled.</v>

2633
01:43:49.180 --> 01:43:52.550
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'd started to take meetings,</v>

2634
01:43:52.551 --> 01:43:54.370
<v Speaker 3>like general meetings and I ended up at</v>
<v Speaker 3>a.</v>

2635
01:43:54.460 --> 01:43:57.410
<v Speaker 3>and it was always sort of news</v>
<v Speaker 3>organizations like little online,</v>

2636
01:43:57.440 --> 01:44:00.500
<v Speaker 3>like I found it wasn't like</v>
<v Speaker 3>entertainment channels.</v>

2637
01:44:00.501 --> 01:44:03.110
<v Speaker 3>It was all these news things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought like you could do something here</v>

2638
01:44:03.111 --> 01:44:04.970
<v Speaker 3>with your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And nobody had a real idea and I went to</v>

2639
01:44:04.971 --> 01:44:09.020
<v Speaker 3>CNN and met Jeff Zucker had the like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>15 minute meeting with Jeff Zucker where</v>

2640
01:44:09.021 --> 01:44:13.010
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had 18,000 tvs on and gave me a news</v>

2641

2644
01:44:16.261 --> 01:44:18.650
<v Speaker 3>paid attention to the news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It was all the kind of shit that if you</v>

<v Speaker 3>phone,</v>

2648
01:44:24.321 --> 01:44:26.660
<v Speaker 3>you would know all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it was really like he was just</v>

2649
01:44:26.670 --> 01:44:27.800
<v Speaker 3>the big news stories of the day.</v>

2650
01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:31.070
<v Speaker 3>Like it was like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know what whatsapp is?</v>

2651
01:44:31.071 --> 01:44:32.570
<v Speaker 3>WHATSAPP,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which just been bought by facebook.</v>

2652
01:44:32.571 --> 01:44:33.250
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2653
01:44:33.250 --> 01:44:37.290
<v Speaker 3>So after it was bought by facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it was like a game show and it was</v>

2654
01:44:37.291 --> 01:44:38.210
<v Speaker 3>just like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was funny,</v>

2655
01:44:38.211 --> 01:44:39.930
<v Speaker 3>but he just wanted to see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2656
01:44:39.950 --> 01:44:41.540
<v Speaker 3>people have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have much respect for community.</v>

2657
01:44:41.541 --> 01:44:44.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean Jeff as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as people who are paying attention all</v>

2658
01:44:44.391 --> 01:44:45.980
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he wanted to see if I was for</v>

2659
01:44:45.981 --> 01:44:46.850
<v Speaker 3>real and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2660
01:44:46.851 --> 01:44:49.520
<v Speaker 3>so and then so they didn't want to see</v>
<v Speaker 3>your mindset.</v>

2661
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:51.560
<v Speaker 3>Well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you concentrating on being the next</v>

2662
01:44:51.561 --> 01:44:55.760
<v Speaker 3>Kevin Hart or Ashley,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you have any actual interests?</v>

2663
01:44:55.790 --> 01:44:58.490
<v Speaker 3>Are you going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you come into this new space and be</v>

2664
01:44:58.491 --> 01:44:59.090
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you,</v>

2665
01:44:59.090 --> 01:45:02.060
<v Speaker 3>because I'm seeing it and you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to sort of be paying attention</v>

2666
01:45:02.061 --> 01:45:02.450
<v Speaker 3>to the news.</v>

2667
01:45:02.450 --> 01:45:04.070
<v Speaker 3>So can you pay attention to what's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on here?</v>

2668
01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:05.690
<v Speaker 3>The bridge gate thing happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2669
01:45:05.691 --> 01:45:07.760
<v Speaker 3>what do you think Christie says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and I sort of riff some things out.</v>

2670
01:45:07.761 --> 01:45:08.594
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

2671
01:45:08.770 --> 01:45:13.770
<v Speaker 3>it's the same shit trumps on weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He.</v>

2672
01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:17.120
<v Speaker 3>So then they had been pitched the show</v>
<v Speaker 3>by this company,</v>

2673
01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:20.600
<v Speaker 3>all three media now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>main event media called black man white</v>

2674
01:45:20.601 --> 01:45:24.950
<v Speaker 3>America where a black man travels around</v>
<v Speaker 3>to all to white spaces in America.</v>

2675
01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:27.880
<v Speaker 3>That was the premise and they told me</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and I was like,</v>

2676
01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:29.560
<v Speaker 3>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want to do like,</v>

2677
01:45:29.570 --> 01:45:30.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I wouldn't want to do that.</v>

2678
01:45:30.771 --> 01:45:33.080
<v Speaker 3>I would want to do it if I could travel</v>
<v Speaker 3>more than just white spaces.</v>

2679
01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:36.590
<v Speaker 3>And they liked that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the Guy Jimmy Fox,</v>

2680
01:45:36.591 --> 01:45:37.680
<v Speaker 3>he hates when I tell the story because</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

2681
01:45:37.690 --> 01:45:38.550
<v Speaker 3>it was such,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he does.</v>

2682
01:45:38.570 --> 01:45:39.920
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he realizes that it wasn't the best</v>

2683
01:45:39.921 --> 01:45:41.600
<v Speaker 3>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was like,</v>

2684
01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:44.000
<v Speaker 3>so then we changed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He changed it to united shades of</v>

2685
01:45:44.001 --> 01:45:46.970
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we pitched the Klan episode.</v>

2686
01:45:47.450 --> 01:45:50.370
<v Speaker 3>That was my idea to talk to the pilot</v>
<v Speaker 3>episode was me with the Klan.</v>

2687
01:45:50.790 --> 01:45:53.000
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck was that like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2688
01:45:53.001 --> 01:45:54.190
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's funny people ask me that.</v>

2689
01:45:54.220 --> 01:45:55.820
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it's exactly what you think</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>

2690
01:45:55.821 --> 01:45:56.331
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2691
01:45:56.331 --> 01:45:57.164
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a,</v>

2692
01:45:57.620 --> 01:46:00.260
<v Speaker 3>I like because it was different versions</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the clan.</v>

2693
01:46:00.261 --> 01:46:02.670
<v Speaker 3>The big one was where they went to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where I went to the cross burning what</v>

2694
01:46:02.671 --> 01:46:06.380
<v Speaker 3>they call a cross lighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A got to be politically correct.</v>

2695
01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:07.890
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it,</v>

2696
01:46:07.970 --> 01:46:10.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean we drove,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I drove into this place,</v>

2697
01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:12.950
<v Speaker 3>I had the camera crew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was one security guy.</v>

2698
01:46:13.190 --> 01:46:14.310
<v Speaker 3>There we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2699
01:46:14.330 --> 01:46:17.090
<v Speaker 3>that was the first day of my first day</v>
<v Speaker 3>at work on the United States of America.</v>

2700
01:46:17.090 --> 01:46:19.310
<v Speaker 3>That was the last thing we did that day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The trailer?</v>

2701
01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:20.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no it was,</v>

2702
01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:25.240
<v Speaker 3>it was off in the woods and Kentucky and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was my first day on the job.</v>

2703
01:46:25.611 --> 01:46:29.570
<v Speaker 3>This was the last thing we did was watch</v>
<v Speaker 3>across burn and we and also when we got</v>

2704
01:46:29.571 --> 01:46:31.970
<v Speaker 3>there we got there during daylight so we</v>
<v Speaker 3>had to be there for several,</v>

2705
01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:36.410
<v Speaker 3>like two or three hours while they did</v>
<v Speaker 3>all their rights while I talked to them</v>

2706
01:46:36.411 --> 01:46:38.270
<v Speaker 3>and interview them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did rites and rituals and then it</v>

2707
01:46:38.271 --> 01:46:42.140
<v Speaker 3>ended with them setting the crossword</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were more than willing to do</v>

2708
01:46:42.141 --> 01:46:44.070
<v Speaker 3>all this on television,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is even more shocked.</v>

2709
01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:46.280
<v Speaker 3>They mostly there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see up there.</v>

2710
01:46:46.281 --> 01:46:49.860
<v Speaker 3>They mostly kept their hoods on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one guy kept,</v>

2711
01:46:49.861 --> 01:46:51.330
<v Speaker 3>took his hood off so you could see his</v>
<v Speaker 3>face.</v>

2712
01:46:51.331 --> 01:46:52.160
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were all there.</v>

2713
01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:53.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people ask me like,</v>

2714
01:46:53.401 --> 01:46:56.430
<v Speaker 3>why would they want to be on tv because</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody wants to be on TV.</v>

2715
01:46:56.430 --> 01:47:00.000
<v Speaker 3>Like we talked to a bunch of different</v>
<v Speaker 3>clan groups and are they the producers?</v>

2716
01:47:00.001 --> 01:47:01.560
<v Speaker 3>Did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of them didn't want to be on tv,</v>

2717
01:47:01.561 --> 01:47:03.310
<v Speaker 3>but there was like three or four that</v>
<v Speaker 3>did because they were.</v>

2718
01:47:03.540 --> 01:47:05.100
<v Speaker 3>They thought they were spreading the</v>
<v Speaker 3>word.</v>

2719
01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:06.650
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2720
01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:08.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was their message like when you</v>

2721
01:47:08.701 --> 01:47:09.810
<v Speaker 3>were talking to them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

2722
01:47:09.860 --> 01:47:14.220
<v Speaker 3>What was the reason for doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They believe America is a white country</v>

2723
01:47:14.221 --> 01:47:17.220
<v Speaker 3>ordained by God that way they believe</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Bible says that's true.</v>

2724
01:47:17.221 --> 01:47:19.080
<v Speaker 3>They believe the Bible talks about</v>
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>

2725
01:47:19.890 --> 01:47:22.620
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm not telling you what I</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe,</v>

2726
01:47:22.621 --> 01:47:26.010
<v Speaker 3>but they believe that the Bible doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>think that the racist should mix.</v>

2727
01:47:26.011 --> 01:47:27.200
<v Speaker 3>The Bible doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2728
01:47:27.210 --> 01:47:28.530
<v Speaker 3>all these things that people quite of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Bible,</v>

2729
01:47:28.531 --> 01:47:30.390
<v Speaker 3>the Bible's talking about donkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were like,</v>

2730
01:47:30.930 --> 01:47:31.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the data.</v>

2731
01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:35.370
<v Speaker 3>And they believed that America is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>white country founded by white people.</v>

2732
01:47:35.580 --> 01:47:37.600
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>

2733
01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:41.070
<v Speaker 3>that the people who like the black</v>
<v Speaker 3>people in the Mexican people and</v>

2734
01:47:41.071 --> 01:47:43.440
<v Speaker 3>eventually the Catholics and the Jews</v>
<v Speaker 3>only they can say cooler with Catholics</v>

2735
01:47:43.441 --> 01:47:45.210
<v Speaker 3>now that you state the Catholics should</v>
<v Speaker 3>get to leave,</v>

2736
01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:48.410
<v Speaker 3>go back home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because America is a and end,</v>

2737
01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:52.800
<v Speaker 3>the whole America is for white people is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole white is just a different way</v>

2738
01:47:52.801 --> 01:47:55.000
<v Speaker 3>of saying the white ethno state thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that a lot of the people rather than</v>

2739
01:47:55.210 --> 01:47:57.510
<v Speaker 3>outright in the national white</v>
<v Speaker 3>nationalist movement say.</v>

2740
01:47:57.980 --> 01:48:00.270
<v Speaker 3>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2741
01:48:01.650 --> 01:48:03.840
<v Speaker 3>they think that this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they,</v>

2742
01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:07.290
<v Speaker 3>they think America's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think this whole idea of America is</v>

2743
01:48:07.291 --> 01:48:09.720
<v Speaker 3>that it's for whites only and that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>rest of us need to go home.</v>

2744
01:48:09.770 --> 01:48:12.390
<v Speaker 3>How does it feel for you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2745
01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:17.160
<v Speaker 3>I'd be standing there with these people</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the woods in Kentucky looking into</v>

2746
01:48:17.161 --> 01:48:18.390
<v Speaker 3>the eyes of madness.</v>

2747
01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:22.740
<v Speaker 3>Why they're wearing satin sheets over</v>
<v Speaker 3>their head with holes poked out for</v>

2748
01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:23.700
<v Speaker 3>eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of.</v>

2749
01:48:23.730 --> 01:48:25.080
<v Speaker 3>It was a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was fun.</v>

2750
01:48:25.110 --> 01:48:26.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like we got there,</v>

2751
01:48:26.371 --> 01:48:27.960
<v Speaker 3>I got out of the car and there's a line</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

2752
01:48:27.961 --> 01:48:30.390
<v Speaker 3>in the show where you can hear me before</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see that I'm going like,</v>

2753
01:48:30.940 --> 01:48:32.160
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this wasn't a good idea,</v>

2754
01:48:32.190 --> 01:48:35.310
<v Speaker 3>and that was really me saying this was</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a good idea.</v>

2755
01:48:35.311 --> 01:48:38.640
<v Speaker 3>That was not me making a joke because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>see a phalanx of them and they're all</v>

2756
01:48:38.641 --> 01:48:40.710
<v Speaker 3>standing there at attention and right</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we got there,</v>

2757
01:48:40.711 --> 01:48:43.920
<v Speaker 3>the guy who was an all blue was like</v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately goes into a rant about</v>

2758
01:48:43.921 --> 01:48:45.540
<v Speaker 3>Ferguson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was in 2014,</v>

2759
01:48:45.541 --> 01:48:48.170
<v Speaker 3>so it was all about Ferguson and how</v>
<v Speaker 3>black people and police themselves and</v>

2760
01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:49.620
<v Speaker 3>the white man is going to Dah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dah,</v>

2761
01:48:49.621 --> 01:48:49.861
<v Speaker 3>Dah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dah,</v>

2762
01:48:49.861 --> 01:48:51.300
<v Speaker 3>Dah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While at the same time they don't</v>

2763
01:48:51.301 --> 01:48:54.270
<v Speaker 3>advocate violence because it's clear</v>
<v Speaker 3>that at some point they were told if you</v>

2764
01:48:54.271 --> 01:48:56.940
<v Speaker 3>talk about violence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the FBI will be here every weekend,</v>

2765
01:48:56.941 --> 01:48:57.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they're like,</v>

2766
01:48:57.961 --> 01:48:58.770
<v Speaker 3>we don't advocate violence.</v>

2767
01:48:58.770 --> 01:49:00.510
<v Speaker 3>We advocate self defense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't hate black people.</v>

2768
01:49:00.511 --> 01:49:03.810
<v Speaker 3>We just love our people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But also black people can't look what</v>

2769
01:49:03.811 --> 01:49:06.030
<v Speaker 3>they're doing in Ferguson that shows</v>
<v Speaker 3>that black people aren't whatever,</v>

2770
01:49:06.031 --> 01:49:08.100
<v Speaker 3>blah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah are the equivalent of the white</v>

2771
01:49:08.101 --> 01:49:09.510
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2772
01:49:09.630 --> 01:49:12.060
<v Speaker 3>and so I had to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when we first started shooting,</v>

2773
01:49:12.300 --> 01:49:14.490
<v Speaker 3>there was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy was just going off and I just</v>

2774
01:49:14.491 --> 01:49:17.100
<v Speaker 3>sorta was like having to take it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>wondering is this going to be the next</v>

2775
01:49:17.101 --> 01:49:20.700
<v Speaker 3>three hours of just like yelling?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the producer stepped in and said,</v>

2776
01:49:20.701 --> 01:49:21.534
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody,</v>

2777
01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:22.493
<v Speaker 3>let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2778
01:49:22.540 --> 01:49:24.900
<v Speaker 3>we got to check the camera for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we slowed it down.</v>

2779
01:49:24.901 --> 01:49:26.970
<v Speaker 3>And then we set up chairs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When we sat down and started talking.</v>

2780
01:49:26.971 --> 01:49:31.971
<v Speaker 3>And from that point forward they were so</v>
<v Speaker 3>excited to talk about their clan thing</v>

2781
01:49:32.460 --> 01:49:35.910
<v Speaker 3>because they don't get asked that a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they sort of like eventually you</v>

2782
01:49:35.911 --> 01:49:37.140
<v Speaker 3>would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you weren't thinking that it was the</v>

2783
01:49:37.141 --> 01:49:37.980
<v Speaker 3>Klan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>

2784
01:49:37.981 --> 01:49:39.000
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is just people talking about their</v>

2785
01:49:39.001 --> 01:49:39.420
<v Speaker 3>lives.</v>

2786
01:49:39.420 --> 01:49:40.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't agree with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're not.</v>

2787
01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:43.890
<v Speaker 3>They didn't stay angry by the end they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were like,</v>

2788
01:49:43.950 --> 01:49:46.680
<v Speaker 3>oh brother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get good sleep as a good time.</v>

2789
01:49:46.700 --> 01:49:47.880
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

2790
01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:50.070
<v Speaker 3>they certainly hug it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2791
01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:52.760
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said to the,</v>

2792
01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:55.090
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do not take any pictures of me hanging</v>

2793
01:49:55.091 --> 01:49:55.924
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2794
01:49:56.450 --> 01:49:57.910
<v Speaker 3>cause I'm doing it as a way like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2795
01:49:57.911 --> 01:50:00.670
<v Speaker 3>thanks man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

2796
01:50:00.740 --> 01:50:02.590
<v Speaker 3>try to reason with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2797
01:50:02.620 --> 01:50:03.453
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked to like,</v>

2798
01:50:03.470 --> 01:50:04.420
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you go,</v>

2799
01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:07.480
<v Speaker 3>well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there was one point they said the</v>

2800
01:50:07.481 --> 01:50:08.870
<v Speaker 3>Bible says that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2801
01:50:08.900 --> 01:50:10.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>managed not to Dah,</v>

2802
01:50:10.431 --> 01:50:10.691
<v Speaker 3>Dah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dah,</v>

2803
01:50:10.691 --> 01:50:10.990
<v Speaker 3>Dah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dah,</v>

2804
01:50:10.990 --> 01:50:11.411
<v Speaker 3>Dah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2805
01:50:11.411 --> 01:50:13.120
<v Speaker 3>you put the Bible also says you</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't eat lobster,</v>

2806
01:50:13.121 --> 01:50:14.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think?</v>

2807
01:50:14.190 --> 01:50:16.300
<v Speaker 3>Well I just went to red lobster last</v>
<v Speaker 3>night brother and you know,</v>

2808
01:50:16.301 --> 01:50:21.301
<v Speaker 3>so they recognize the hypocrisy but they</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't see why it doesn't make sense.</v>

2809
01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:21.840
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2810
01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:23.170
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't see why like,</v>

2811
01:50:23.171 --> 01:50:25.090
<v Speaker 3>well if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just saying these things,</v>

2812
01:50:25.091 --> 01:50:27.220
<v Speaker 3>these aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Bible should not be the reason this</v>

2813
01:50:27.221 --> 01:50:28.054
<v Speaker 3>is happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2814
01:50:28.150 --> 01:50:32.110
<v Speaker 3>So it's just a convenient way to justify</v>
<v Speaker 3>wearing their goofy clothes.</v>

2815
01:50:32.140 --> 01:50:33.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they,</v>

2816
01:50:33.011 --> 01:50:34.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they said they don't.</v>

2817
01:50:35.020 --> 01:50:38.920
<v Speaker 3>This was called the new clan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't hate black people,</v>

2818
01:50:38.921 --> 01:50:41.830
<v Speaker 3>they just really love white people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I feel like you can really love</v>

2819
01:50:41.831 --> 01:50:44.020
<v Speaker 3>white people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it shouldn't come with at the</v>

2820
01:50:44.021 --> 01:50:46.480
<v Speaker 3>expense of black people feeling safe or</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody feeling safe.</v>

2821
01:50:46.510 --> 01:50:48.670
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing with the all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can think what you want to think,</v>

2822
01:50:48.671 --> 01:50:51.190
<v Speaker 3>but nobody should feel like their safety</v>
<v Speaker 3>is being violated in that process.</v>

2823
01:50:51.191 --> 01:50:52.300
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2824
01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:54.790
<v Speaker 3>the funny thing was is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we would film it and we'd have to</v>

2825
01:50:54.791 --> 01:50:57.370
<v Speaker 3>stop down because we were changing</v>
<v Speaker 3>cameras whenever we stopped and they</v>

2826
01:50:57.371 --> 01:50:58.780
<v Speaker 3>pull off the hoods off and they'd be</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2827
01:50:58.781 --> 01:50:59.980
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hot under here.</v>

2828
01:51:00.220 --> 01:51:00.761
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2829
01:51:00.761 --> 01:51:04.630
<v Speaker 3>maybe you guys should have designed the</v>
<v Speaker 3>hoods more breathable fabric.</v>

2830
01:51:04.631 --> 01:51:07.720
<v Speaker 3>Maybe get under armour in here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they didn't,</v>

2831
01:51:07.750 --> 01:51:09.490
<v Speaker 3>we didn't use it on camera because we</v>
<v Speaker 3>can show their faces.</v>

2832
01:51:09.491 --> 01:51:11.830
<v Speaker 3>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was like they were like,</v>

2833
01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:14.560
<v Speaker 3>there were some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was like two different groups.</v>

2834
01:51:14.561 --> 01:51:17.290
<v Speaker 3>There was one group who like was okay</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to me.</v>

2835
01:51:17.291 --> 01:51:19.000
<v Speaker 3>And then there was another group where</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time we stopped down,</v>

2836
01:51:19.001 --> 01:51:21.010
<v Speaker 3>they would go away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would walk away and one of them was</v>

2837
01:51:21.011 --> 01:51:24.130
<v Speaker 3>this blonde was the one who was in red</v>
<v Speaker 3>when she took her hood off.</v>

2838
01:51:24.131 --> 01:51:27.040
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean she looked like the Brittany</v>

2839
01:51:27.041 --> 01:51:29.080
<v Speaker 3>spears at 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this blonde,</v>

2840
01:51:29.410 --> 01:51:30.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as we sound earlier,</v>

2841
01:51:30.911 --> 01:51:32.320
<v Speaker 3>maybe I don't know what a pretty white</v>
<v Speaker 3>woman looks like.</v>

2842
01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:34.170
<v Speaker 3>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she was abroad.</v>

2843
01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:37.210
<v Speaker 3>She had red fingernails but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she was wearing a red,</v>

2844
01:51:37.420 --> 01:51:41.020
<v Speaker 3>a red thing because she's fourth</v>
<v Speaker 3>generation clan.</v>

2845
01:51:41.470 --> 01:51:43.300
<v Speaker 3>So her thing is all red and she looked</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2846
01:51:43.330 --> 01:51:45.610
<v Speaker 3>because she's fourth generation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was ready.</v>

2847
01:51:45.620 --> 01:51:49.870
<v Speaker 3>You get to wear the blue</v>
<v Speaker 3>belt system.</v>

2848
01:51:49.900 --> 01:51:53.200
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get the whole fourth</v>
<v Speaker 3>generation.</v>

2849
01:51:53.201 --> 01:51:54.540
<v Speaker 3>So she.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But she's like,</v>

2850
01:51:54.550 --> 01:51:56.170
<v Speaker 3>so she like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time she took her hood off she</v>

2851
01:51:56.180 --> 01:51:59.080
<v Speaker 3>looked like she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she wanted to kill me,</v>

2852
01:51:59.160 --> 01:51:59.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it never.</v>

2853
01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:02.580
<v Speaker 3>I never thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well yeah or that they had never,</v>

2854
01:52:02.620 --> 01:52:04.210
<v Speaker 3>never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like kind of a couple of</v>

2855
01:52:04.211 --> 01:52:04.820
<v Speaker 3>drinks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dinner.</v>

2856
01:52:04.820 --> 01:52:06.730
<v Speaker 3>You guys started dancing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just feel like if I could just take</v>

2857
01:52:06.731 --> 01:52:09.310
<v Speaker 3>you to la,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a whole life for you at away</v>

2858
01:52:09.340 --> 01:52:11.410
<v Speaker 3>from Kentucky where that you would have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2859
01:52:11.950 --> 01:52:15.730
<v Speaker 3>I can make a lot of money off your kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it so funny though that it's just</v>

2860
01:52:15.731 --> 01:52:18.790
<v Speaker 3>what you're exposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a young child and you just</v>

2861
01:52:18.791 --> 01:52:22.480
<v Speaker 3>don't understand your clan and your pr</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's black people,</v>

2862
01:52:22.481 --> 01:52:24.430
<v Speaker 3>there's not enough black people in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>community for you to go.</v>

2863
01:52:24.430 --> 01:52:26.830
<v Speaker 3>Well that's weird because he's black</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are fine because in this part of</v>

2864
01:52:26.831 --> 01:52:28.330
<v Speaker 3>Kentucky there's not a lot of black</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2865
01:52:28.331 --> 01:52:30.730
<v Speaker 3>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are some because that's black</v>

2866
01:52:30.731 --> 01:52:33.580
<v Speaker 3>people everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's not enough to like sort of</v>

2867
01:52:33.850 --> 01:52:36.310
<v Speaker 3>for these people to interact with and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're told to avoid that black guy who</v>

2868
01:52:36.311 --> 01:52:38.110
<v Speaker 3>works at the home depot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you ended up,</v>

2869
01:52:38.140 --> 01:52:39.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you just see that it's like it's</v>

2870
01:52:39.791 --> 01:52:42.790
<v Speaker 3>about circumstance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not necessarily about,</v>

2871
01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:44.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we could get the.</v>

2872
01:52:44.670 --> 01:52:46.160
<v Speaker 3>If you get people out of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>circumstances,</v>

2873
01:52:46.161 --> 01:52:50.270
<v Speaker 3>I think they would change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I want to have the input of the</v>

2874
01:52:50.271 --> 01:52:53.780
<v Speaker 3>environment that you're in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just kits so people get so wrapped up</v>

2875
01:52:53.781 --> 01:52:54.050
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2876
01:52:54.050 --> 01:52:56.660
<v Speaker 3>caught up in it and it becomes how they</v>
<v Speaker 3>think and it's.</v>

2877
01:52:56.840 --> 01:52:59.090
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to stand out from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>group,</v>

2878
01:52:59.091 --> 01:53:03.560
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to be ostracized and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a fucking cross.</v>

2879
01:53:03.590 --> 01:53:07.010
<v Speaker 3>It's not gonna light itself was okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're really excited.</v>

2880
01:53:07.011 --> 01:53:09.590
<v Speaker 3>Like this one guy I talked to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we sort of built a rapport in that</v>

2881
01:53:09.591 --> 01:53:12.440
<v Speaker 3>moment and he was excited to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they were like,</v>

2882
01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:14.680
<v Speaker 3>where'd you get the wood from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you do like,</v>

2883
01:53:14.810 --> 01:53:15.790
<v Speaker 3>he was excited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

2884
01:53:15.791 --> 01:53:16.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like this old,</v>

2885
01:53:17.280 --> 01:53:18.230
<v Speaker 3>this old cross,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2886
01:53:18.231 --> 01:53:20.660
<v Speaker 3>like he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>excited.</v>

2887
01:53:21.650 --> 01:53:25.520
<v Speaker 3>He was excited to talk about this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so we sort of talked on that level</v>

2888
01:53:25.580 --> 01:53:26.900
<v Speaker 3>and I still asked all the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

2889
01:53:26.901 --> 01:53:30.160
<v Speaker 3>obviously I don't agree with you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said it as like in a,</v>

2890
01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:33.770
<v Speaker 3>hopefully at the angel let me leave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I was kind of joking and also at</v>

2891
01:53:33.771 --> 01:53:35.630
<v Speaker 3>the whole time I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what's,</v>

2892
01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:39.370
<v Speaker 3>what if this is a setup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if I'm here to talk to these 15</v>

2893
01:53:39.470 --> 01:53:39.740
<v Speaker 3>guys?</v>

2894
01:53:39.740 --> 01:53:43.340
<v Speaker 3>And then a hundred Klans members run out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the woods to take down CNN.</v>

2895
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:44.870
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is before fake news trump.</v>

2896
01:53:44.871 --> 01:53:46.050
<v Speaker 3>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2897
01:53:46.470 --> 01:53:50.270
<v Speaker 3>so the whole time I was there I also</v>
<v Speaker 3>felt like this could go bad at any time</v>

2898
01:53:50.271 --> 01:53:51.660
<v Speaker 3>because when we pulled in there was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy holding a,</v>

2899
01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:54.080
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a rifle and we told them no guns</v>

2900
01:53:54.081 --> 01:53:56.480
<v Speaker 3>and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I don't believe I'm gonna bring my</v>

2901
01:53:56.481 --> 01:53:58.940
<v Speaker 3>gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it just felt like this could</v>

2902
01:53:58.941 --> 01:53:59.830
<v Speaker 3>turn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2903
01:54:00.570 --> 01:54:01.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna do anything to turn it</v>
<v Speaker 3>badly,</v>

2904
01:54:01.971 --> 01:54:05.150
<v Speaker 3>but this could turn bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it felt like it felt the whole</v>

2905
01:54:05.151 --> 01:54:07.670
<v Speaker 3>time when I was making jokes with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>client and people go,</v>

2906
01:54:07.671 --> 01:54:10.970
<v Speaker 3>how could you make to the clan?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was actually using self defense.</v>

2907
01:54:10.971 --> 01:54:13.040
<v Speaker 3>Like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you're making people laugh,</v>

2908
01:54:13.100 --> 01:54:13.820
<v Speaker 3>they generally.</v>

2909
01:54:13.820 --> 01:54:15.500
<v Speaker 3>And I wasn't making them laugh at my</v>
<v Speaker 3>expense.</v>

2910
01:54:15.501 --> 01:54:17.540
<v Speaker 3>I was just making them laugh about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's weird.</v>

2911
01:54:17.541 --> 01:54:20.390
<v Speaker 3>Why do you burn this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That it actually felt to me like I could</v>

2912
01:54:20.391 --> 01:54:23.600
<v Speaker 3>gain control of the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you have any sort of reasonable</v>

2913
01:54:23.601 --> 01:54:27.080
<v Speaker 3>debate with them or report any back and</v>
<v Speaker 3>forth with them?</v>

2914
01:54:27.081 --> 01:54:30.170
<v Speaker 3>We like did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was there anybody that you kind of felt</v>

2915
01:54:30.171 --> 01:54:34.790
<v Speaker 3>like they saw how ridiculous it is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2916
01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:37.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think we like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would like uh,</v>

2917
01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:40.820
<v Speaker 3>like I would make them laugh about</v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous things that were happening.</v>

2918
01:54:40.970 --> 01:54:43.950
<v Speaker 3>Like they were having a hard time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2919
01:54:43.990 --> 01:54:45.580
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like getting the car,</v>

2920
01:54:45.770 --> 01:54:48.260
<v Speaker 3>getting care,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seen rags to wrap the cross in like,</v>

2921
01:54:48.261 --> 01:54:48.851
<v Speaker 3>and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to.</v>

2922
01:54:48.851 --> 01:54:52.180
<v Speaker 3>Clans went over here and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do we have to do to get a went over</v>

2923
01:54:52.181 --> 01:54:54.260
<v Speaker 3>here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're laughing,</v>

2924
01:54:54.261 --> 01:54:55.370
<v Speaker 3>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

2925
01:54:55.370 --> 01:54:58.490
<v Speaker 3>But there's not a sense of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what I felt like by the end I</v>

2926
01:54:58.491 --> 01:55:01.760
<v Speaker 3>knew some of those guys liked me in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>

2927
01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:05.060
<v Speaker 3>I felt like they laughed when I said</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were certainly trying to cheer me</v>

2928
01:55:05.061 --> 01:55:06.200
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give me their business card.</v>

2929
01:55:06.201 --> 01:55:07.960
<v Speaker 3>You if you need any help,</v>
<v Speaker 3>find another class.</v>

2930
01:55:08.310 --> 01:55:10.790
<v Speaker 3>Because there's some when we're out here</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are full of Shit and you need to go</v>

2931
01:55:10.791 --> 01:55:11.624
<v Speaker 3>to the real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's.</v>

2932
01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:13.460
<v Speaker 3>So there's that level of rapport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

2933
01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:16.340
<v Speaker 3>So there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's factions that disagree with</v>

2934
01:55:16.341 --> 01:55:18.230
<v Speaker 3>other faculty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's like,</v>

2935
01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:20.180
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it's very similar to martial</v>
<v Speaker 3>arts school.</v>

2936
01:55:20.181 --> 01:55:22.400
<v Speaker 3>This is the real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the real karate.</v>

2937
01:55:23.680 --> 01:55:24.720
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2938
01:55:25.310 --> 01:55:28.700
<v Speaker 3>even though did you guys start at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same school but he didn't get the real</v>

2939
01:55:28.701 --> 01:55:29.390
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

2940
01:55:29.390 --> 01:55:30.550
<v Speaker 3>Oh boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2941
01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:31.131
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2942
01:55:31.131 --> 01:55:32.910
<v Speaker 3>but they were very chummy at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also I was like,</v>

2943
01:55:32.920 --> 01:55:36.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't get the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I did feel like some of these guys</v>

2944
01:55:36.591 --> 01:55:38.690
<v Speaker 3>went to bed that night going a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>fun.</v>

2945
01:55:40.810 --> 01:55:43.680
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm not saying that like they</v>
<v Speaker 3>dropped the clan thing because I didn't</v>

2946
01:55:43.681 --> 01:55:45.180
<v Speaker 3>come back the next day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were like,</v>

2947
01:55:45.210 --> 01:55:45.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2948
01:55:45.820 --> 01:55:48.020
<v Speaker 3>I left there feeling like I wonder if I</v>
<v Speaker 3>came back like in it,</v>

2949
01:55:48.290 --> 01:55:50.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six months to stroll through and was</v>

2950
01:55:50.571 --> 01:55:51.270
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey guys,</v>

2951
01:55:51.270 --> 01:55:53.940
<v Speaker 3>or are you wonder if you guys are on</v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of reality show where it's</v>

2952
01:55:53.941 --> 01:55:55.760
<v Speaker 3>talking on an island for six months?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2953
01:55:55.761 --> 01:55:58.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the reason why big cities are</v>

2954
01:55:58.591 --> 01:56:01.980
<v Speaker 3>more generally more liberal than the</v>
<v Speaker 3>surrounding areas is because everybody's</v>

2955
01:56:01.981 --> 01:56:02.880
<v Speaker 3>on top of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2956
01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:05.550
<v Speaker 3>It just because everybody's on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have time to hate you because</v>

2957
01:56:05.551 --> 01:56:07.200
<v Speaker 3>you make it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like your Bodega,</v>

2958
01:56:08.460 --> 01:56:10.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have time to become accustomed</v>

2959
01:56:10.741 --> 01:56:12.570
<v Speaker 3>to each other and you realize it's just</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2960
01:56:12.571 --> 01:56:14.640
<v Speaker 3>And then you also see the benefits of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that thing.</v>

2961
01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:14.971
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2962
01:56:14.971 --> 01:56:16.860
<v Speaker 3>the Puerto Rican day parade is fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2963
01:56:16.861 --> 01:56:19.140
<v Speaker 3>Like it's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your life experiences,</v>

2964
01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:21.690
<v Speaker 3>your are benefited by the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're surrounded by lots of different.</v>

2965
01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:23.580
<v Speaker 3>That is really interesting when you put</v>
<v Speaker 3>it that way.</v>

2966
01:56:23.850 --> 01:56:27.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean you do find that the bigger</v>
<v Speaker 3>cities tend to be way more liberal like</v>

2967
01:56:27.901 --> 01:56:30.300
<v Speaker 3>New York and La in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Certainly more liberal than the</v>

2968
01:56:30.301 --> 01:56:33.810
<v Speaker 3>surrounding areas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Houston is a blue dot,</v>

2969
01:56:33.811 --> 01:56:37.450
<v Speaker 3>but it's not as blue as like Berkeley is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the surrounding areas.</v>

2970
01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:39.960
<v Speaker 3>Much different sugar land out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2971
01:56:39.961 --> 01:56:40.830
<v Speaker 3>You get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2972
01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:42.370
<v Speaker 3>you go out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ranches</v>

2973
01:56:44.980 --> 01:56:48.010
<v Speaker 3>crisp enough or run or are you a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2974
01:56:48.030 --> 01:56:50.940
<v Speaker 3>so I think that to me that's what the</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole thing is,</v>

2975
01:56:50.941 --> 01:56:52.770
<v Speaker 3>is that just not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have enough.</v>

2976
01:56:52.830 --> 01:56:56.160
<v Speaker 3>You don't get the benefit of having a</v>
<v Speaker 3>diverse community because you're like,</v>

2977
01:56:56.250 --> 01:56:59.790
<v Speaker 3>which Chinese restaurant do I want to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>to and you want to go to the Chinese</v>

2978
01:56:59.791 --> 01:57:02.730
<v Speaker 3>restaurant that's run by the Chinese</v>
<v Speaker 3>family who was like,</v>

2979
01:57:02.731 --> 01:57:03.900
<v Speaker 3>this was a bad idea.</v>

2980
01:57:04.020 --> 01:57:05.400
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also the fear.</v>

2981
01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:07.920
<v Speaker 3>Know the fear of the other when you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>not around them.</v>

2982
01:57:07.921 --> 01:57:11.280
<v Speaker 3>I think if you were around people all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the time that are all sorts of different</v>

2983
01:57:11.281 --> 01:57:12.600
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>

2984
01:57:12.790 --> 01:57:16.860
<v Speaker 3>you find assholes that are white and</v>
<v Speaker 3>cool people that are brown and just sort</v>

2985
01:57:16.861 --> 01:57:17.431
<v Speaker 3>of go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2986
01:57:17.431 --> 01:57:21.860
<v Speaker 3>they're just humans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just were terrified and so we lump</v>

2987
01:57:21.930 --> 01:57:23.820
<v Speaker 3>off into groups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we somehow or another,</v>

2988
01:57:23.821 --> 01:57:25.650
<v Speaker 3>I have people that we relate to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2989
01:57:25.651 --> 01:57:27.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a whole thing about like we</v>

2990
01:57:27.710 --> 01:57:28.350
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are,</v>

2991
01:57:28.350 --> 01:57:32.040
<v Speaker 3>we have fear of the unknown and somehow</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fear of the unknown is the fear that</v>

2992
01:57:32.041 --> 01:57:35.370
<v Speaker 3>somehow that unknown thing is going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>hurt us or affect us in some negative</v>

2993
01:57:35.371 --> 01:57:36.204
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2994
01:57:36.250 --> 01:57:37.083
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2995
01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:38.970
<v Speaker 3>when Obama first went into the White</v>
<v Speaker 3>House,</v>

2996
01:57:39.900 --> 01:57:42.150
<v Speaker 3>I would have lost money on get out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>marriage equality,</v>

2997
01:57:42.151 --> 01:57:42.630
<v Speaker 3>gay marriage.</v>

2998
01:57:42.630 --> 01:57:43.530
<v Speaker 3>I lost month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I was like,</v>

2999
01:57:43.531 --> 01:57:44.420
<v Speaker 3>that's not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

3000
01:57:44.520 --> 01:57:44.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3001
01:57:44.970 --> 01:57:45.960
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no,</v>

3002
01:57:46.140 --> 01:57:47.970
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have put 50 years,</v>

3003
01:57:48.030 --> 01:57:48.930
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

3004
01:57:49.140 --> 01:57:51.210
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just because I thought that ball was</v>

3005
01:57:51.211 --> 01:57:53.700
<v Speaker 3>moving in that direction anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I still wouldn't have thought that</v>

3006
01:57:53.701 --> 01:57:55.370
<v Speaker 3>it was going to happen in his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>within his pr.</v>

3007
01:57:55.400 --> 01:57:56.490
<v Speaker 3>I first I just did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

3008
01:57:56.491 --> 01:57:58.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm not the issue he came in campaigning</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

3009
01:57:58.291 --> 01:58:01.050
<v Speaker 3>so it wasn't like something that was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think it was on his,</v>

3010
01:58:01.110 --> 01:58:02.940
<v Speaker 3>on anybody's agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew it was on some people's agenda.</v>

3011
01:58:02.941 --> 01:58:05.240
<v Speaker 3>There were people working on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't think it wasn't something</v>

3012
01:58:05.250 --> 01:58:06.630
<v Speaker 3>that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't,</v>

3013
01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:08.580
<v Speaker 3>the combination didn't set that as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>goal.</v>

3014
01:58:08.581 --> 01:58:11.010
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't like a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like obamacare was like we need to fix</v>

3015
01:58:11.011 --> 01:58:12.420
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it sort of happened in a way that</v>

3016
01:58:12.421 --> 01:58:15.480
<v Speaker 3>like the people worked behind the scenes</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make it happen and then it just sort</v>

3017
01:58:15.481 --> 01:58:17.640
<v Speaker 3>of woke up one day and opened our phones</v>
<v Speaker 3>up and it was like,</v>

3018
01:58:17.641 --> 01:58:18.750
<v Speaker 3>it's legal weight.</v>

3019
01:58:18.750 --> 01:58:19.700
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Federally?</v>

3020
01:58:19.730 --> 01:58:20.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>federal.</v>

3021
01:58:20.330 --> 01:58:21.163
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3022
01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:22.160
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you just sort happened.</v>

3023
01:58:22.161 --> 01:58:22.561
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

3024
01:58:22.561 --> 01:58:23.530
<v Speaker 3>wait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought nothing.</v>

3025
01:58:23.550 --> 01:58:25.320
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the most disappointing</v>

3026
01:58:25.321 --> 01:58:28.410
<v Speaker 3>things about hillary is that she didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>up until 2013,</v>

3027
01:58:28.411 --> 01:58:30.300
<v Speaker 3>she didn't support marriage equality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3028
01:58:30.301 --> 01:58:31.620
<v Speaker 3>And I mean Obama was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3029
01:58:31.630 --> 01:58:34.980
<v Speaker 3>he had the thing that he sort of stopped</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about it for a series of years</v>

3030
01:58:35.160 --> 01:58:36.930
<v Speaker 3>and then eventually it was like Joe</v>
<v Speaker 3>Biden was like,</v>

3031
01:58:36.931 --> 01:58:38.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Obama had to be like,</v>

3032
01:58:38.180 --> 01:58:39.490
<v Speaker 3>God dammit show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3033
01:58:39.510 --> 01:58:42.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm with it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't ready to say it yet.</v>

3034
01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:44.400
<v Speaker 3>Touchy subject amongst some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it.</v>

3035
01:58:44.401 --> 01:58:45.234
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think,</v>

3036
01:58:45.590 --> 01:58:48.130
<v Speaker 3>and it still is among some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's certainly people's country,</v>

3037
01:58:48.340 --> 01:58:50.090
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a critical mass of people who</v>

3038
01:58:50.091 --> 01:58:51.310
<v Speaker 3>are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't actually affect me.</v>

3039
01:58:51.370 --> 01:58:52.870
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And right now we're going through that</v>

3040
01:58:52.871 --> 01:58:54.460
<v Speaker 3>with trans people in bathrooms.</v>

3041
01:58:54.460 --> 01:58:56.890
<v Speaker 3>Like it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't actually affect you,</v>

3042
01:58:56.920 --> 01:58:59.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people transmit,</v>

3043
01:58:59.301 --> 01:59:01.900
<v Speaker 3>we go into the bathroom for the entire</v>
<v Speaker 3>existence that there've been bathrooms.</v>

3044
01:59:01.901 --> 01:59:04.180
<v Speaker 3>You just didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't actually affect you.</v>

3045
01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:05.950
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think you think it,</v>

3046
01:59:06.150 --> 01:59:08.200
<v Speaker 3>you were sort of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is weird to me,</v>

3047
01:59:08.380 --> 01:59:11.030
<v Speaker 3>this is scary to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's wrong,</v>

3048
01:59:11.031 --> 01:59:11.621
<v Speaker 3>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3049
01:59:11.621 --> 01:59:15.100
<v Speaker 3>it's just weird and scary to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those feelings are just feelings of the</v>

3050
01:59:15.101 --> 01:59:18.820
<v Speaker 3>unknown down now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The assess the threat that that woman</v>

3051
01:59:18.821 --> 01:59:21.820
<v Speaker 3>goes to the bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She have gone to the bathroom.</v>

3052
01:59:22.350 --> 01:59:24.520
<v Speaker 3>Like there's not a threat that's coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>after you.</v>

3053
01:59:24.610 --> 01:59:25.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people are scared of people</v>

3054
01:59:25.961 --> 01:59:29.920
<v Speaker 3>taking their clothes off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what it is with the generals</v>

3055
01:59:29.921 --> 01:59:32.410
<v Speaker 3>are going to be exposed and they just</v>
<v Speaker 3>kinda go crazy.</v>

3056
01:59:32.460 --> 01:59:33.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they're.</v>

3057
01:59:33.290 --> 01:59:34.720
<v Speaker 3>The generals already were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's cool.</v>

3058
01:59:34.721 --> 01:59:35.650
<v Speaker 3>We just need bodies.</v>

3059
01:59:35.680 --> 01:59:36.161
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3060
01:59:36.161 --> 01:59:38.500
<v Speaker 3>like the military was already had</v>
<v Speaker 3>already accepted trans people.</v>

3061
01:59:38.501 --> 01:59:39.970
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just need bodies.</v>

3062
01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.510
<v Speaker 3>We need people here who are good</v>
<v Speaker 3>soldiers or the military ones.</v>

3063
01:59:42.520 --> 01:59:45.220
<v Speaker 3>Real weird because he's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He apparently did that while the</v>

3064
01:59:45.221 --> 01:59:46.710
<v Speaker 3>hurricane was hitting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3065
01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:50.770
<v Speaker 3>he see pardoned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our Pio did that and there was one other</v>

3066
01:59:50.771 --> 01:59:53.170
<v Speaker 3>thing that he did that I'm not exactly</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure what it was.</v>

3067
01:59:53.171 --> 01:59:55.650
<v Speaker 3>He started bringing up again recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Controversial things.</v>

3068
01:59:55.651 --> 01:59:56.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3069
01:59:56.630 --> 01:59:58.210
<v Speaker 3>Trying to get Mexico to pay for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>wall.</v>

3070
01:59:58.211 --> 01:59:59.680
<v Speaker 3>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't do think the Mexicans would be</v>

3071
01:59:59.681 --> 02:00:02.740
<v Speaker 3>paying for an education,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take care of the poor people.</v>

3072
02:00:03.150 --> 02:00:04.990
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of issues they have to take</v>
<v Speaker 3>care of.</v>

3073
02:00:05.230 --> 02:00:07.360
<v Speaker 3>Didn't have time for your father and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's just no way you can make them</v>

3074
02:00:07.361 --> 02:00:08.410
<v Speaker 3>pay for the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not,</v>

3075
02:00:08.411 --> 02:00:09.770
<v Speaker 3>it's not a thing you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

3076
02:00:09.890 --> 02:00:11.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless we're talking about invading</v>

3077
02:00:11.921 --> 02:00:13.930
<v Speaker 3>Mexico instead of going into the banks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3078
02:00:13.931 --> 02:00:15.070
<v Speaker 3>like it's that we're talking about you.</v>

3079
02:00:15.190 --> 02:00:18.460
<v Speaker 3>Have you heard about the wall being a</v>
<v Speaker 3>gigantic solar panel?</v>

3080
02:00:18.880 --> 02:00:23.320
<v Speaker 3>One of the ideas to pay for the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The wall would be a gigantic solar power</v>

3081
02:00:23.321 --> 02:00:25.790
<v Speaker 3>to generate electricity and pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh that's,</v>

3082
02:00:25.860 --> 02:00:27.910
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then he'd have to accept solar</v>

3083
02:00:27.911 --> 02:00:31.250
<v Speaker 3>panels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Try to run into problems with the coal</v>

3084
02:00:31.251 --> 02:00:32.021
<v Speaker 3>folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3085
02:00:32.021 --> 02:00:34.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people just want to burn trees,</v>

3086
02:00:35.170 --> 02:00:37.470
<v Speaker 3>chop trees down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike Cole.</v>

3087
02:00:37.490 --> 02:00:38.323
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3088
02:00:38.340 --> 02:00:40.990
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so for me,</v>

3089
02:00:40.991 --> 02:00:43.180
<v Speaker 3>the back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing with the show is like,</v>

3090
02:00:43.181 --> 02:00:45.190
<v Speaker 3>it's for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not about me coming to agreement</v>

3091
02:00:45.191 --> 02:00:47.710
<v Speaker 3>with people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's people like I do agree</v>

3092
02:00:47.711 --> 02:00:48.970
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know your issue a lot,</v>

3093
02:00:48.971 --> 02:00:51.970
<v Speaker 3>so I'd like to talk to you about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just about the fact to me it's like</v>

3094
02:00:51.971 --> 02:00:53.470
<v Speaker 3>it's about we're going to have this</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>

3095
02:00:53.590 --> 02:00:56.650
<v Speaker 3>People are gonna Watch this conversation</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that will create more conversation.</v>

3096
02:00:56.890 --> 02:00:58.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're getting this weird opportunity.</v>

3097
02:00:58.781 --> 02:01:01.840
<v Speaker 3>Be Key to be again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm saying that you're you like I</v>

3098
02:01:01.841 --> 02:01:03.910
<v Speaker 3>know you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when I see you on tv,</v>

3099
02:01:03.970 --> 02:01:04.481
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3100
02:01:04.481 --> 02:01:05.350
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

3101
02:01:05.351 --> 02:01:06.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

3102
02:01:07.070 --> 02:01:09.580
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's normal for a television show.</v>

3103
02:01:10.050 --> 02:01:14.350
<v Speaker 3>Do you notice when people take on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>host of whether it's the tonight show or</v>

3104
02:01:14.351 --> 02:01:17.710
<v Speaker 3>one of those kinds of shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they automatically become this different</v>

3105
02:01:17.711 --> 02:01:21.310
<v Speaker 3>thing than they usually are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They become like the host of a show,</v>

3106
02:01:21.580 --> 02:01:23.970
<v Speaker 3>and for me that the reason that is is</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there wasn't a.</v>

3107
02:01:23.990 --> 02:01:24.823
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not,</v>

3108
02:01:25.090 --> 02:01:26.560
<v Speaker 3>there's not a ton of these shows out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

3109
02:01:26.610 --> 02:01:28.180
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's not like.</v>

3110
02:01:28.181 --> 02:01:28.571
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3111
02:01:28.571 --> 02:01:29.560
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got that show.</v>

3112
02:01:29.561 --> 02:01:32.020
<v Speaker 3>It's like talk shows the minute I got</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally biased.</v>

3113
02:01:32.021 --> 02:01:35.230
<v Speaker 3>Suddenly I'm seeing articles about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>tonight show,</v>

3114
02:01:35.380 --> 02:01:36.880
<v Speaker 3>the late,</v>
<v Speaker 3>late,</v>

3115
02:01:36.881 --> 02:01:38.920
<v Speaker 3>late show and totally biased,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait what?</v>

3116
02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:41.960
<v Speaker 3>And then I'm being compared to those</v>
<v Speaker 3>people and I'm being judged against</v>

3117
02:01:41.961 --> 02:01:43.550
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well last night fallon lip sync with</v>

3118
02:01:43.790 --> 02:01:46.880
<v Speaker 3>Justin timberlake about talked to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Laverne Cox.</v>

3119
02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:48.370
<v Speaker 3>That's not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

3120
02:01:48.540 --> 02:01:50.030
<v Speaker 3>I read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why I didn't like about that is</v>

3121
02:01:50.031 --> 02:01:52.430
<v Speaker 3>that people were suddenly defining me</v>
<v Speaker 3>against that thing and I was not.</v>

3122
02:01:52.750 --> 02:01:53.900
<v Speaker 3>And I would look at that show and be</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3123
02:01:53.901 --> 02:01:55.490
<v Speaker 3>that's not me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I had friends who watch the show and</v>

3124
02:01:55.491 --> 02:01:56.241
<v Speaker 3>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not me.</v>

3125
02:01:56.241 --> 02:01:58.310
<v Speaker 3>And then we'd write things for the show</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'd say things like this,</v>

3126
02:01:58.311 --> 02:01:59.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3127
02:01:59.570 --> 02:02:02.120
<v Speaker 3>or I don't feel as passionately about</v>
<v Speaker 3>this as the show makes me think,</v>

3128
02:02:02.121 --> 02:02:04.850
<v Speaker 3>I feel about this because we just have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get the show done.</v>

3129
02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:06.950
<v Speaker 3>Whereas with this show I can go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3130
02:02:07.010 --> 02:02:10.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that or I or I really</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to say this and I can rewrite</v>

3131
02:02:10.281 --> 02:02:11.390
<v Speaker 3>things and I can go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3132
02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:13.820
<v Speaker 3>So totally biased.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You did in front of an audience and it</v>

3133
02:02:13.821 --> 02:02:14.654
<v Speaker 3>was more of A.</v>

3134
02:02:14.870 --> 02:02:18.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that that form works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's a good way.</v>

3135
02:02:18.920 --> 02:02:20.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't think for anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's a good way to have</v>

3136
02:02:20.871 --> 02:02:24.070
<v Speaker 3>meaningful conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No giant groups of people and yeah,</v>

3137
02:02:24.260 --> 02:02:25.550
<v Speaker 3>everybody's clapping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3138
02:02:25.670 --> 02:02:28.040
<v Speaker 3>So you're trying to like play to them to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make a good point.</v>

3139
02:02:28.041 --> 02:02:31.700
<v Speaker 3>So you're not necessarily expressing</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself like what would this,</v>

3140
02:02:31.850 --> 02:02:33.560
<v Speaker 3>what are the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are the real thoughts going on in</v>

3141
02:02:33.561 --> 02:02:37.220
<v Speaker 3>my mind as much as you're just trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get those points,</v>

3142
02:02:37.710 --> 02:02:38.820
<v Speaker 3>get laughs and I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3143
02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:41.240
<v Speaker 3>and the thing that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I give credit to Chris rock for this</v>

3144
02:02:41.241 --> 02:02:43.790
<v Speaker 3>because he's the one who made me do the</v>
<v Speaker 3>man on the street segments on totally</v>

3145
02:02:43.791 --> 02:02:44.624
<v Speaker 3>biased.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

3146
02:02:44.690 --> 02:02:46.100
<v Speaker 3>you need to get out there and people</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know who you are.</v>

3147
02:02:46.101 --> 02:02:47.770
<v Speaker 3>You need to mix it up with the people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

3148
02:02:47.771 --> 02:02:48.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't like.</v>

3149
02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:50.240
<v Speaker 3>I really didn't like whenever I saw</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who were on the street,</v>

3150
02:02:50.241 --> 02:02:51.530
<v Speaker 3>it was always like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey dummy,</v>

3151
02:02:51.531 --> 02:02:53.230
<v Speaker 3>why'd you stop and talk to me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He</v>

3152
02:02:55.060 --> 02:02:58.340
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have a lot going on and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>decided to be nice and stuff and talk to</v>

3153
02:02:58.341 --> 02:02:59.720
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm going to punish you for it.</v>

3154
02:02:59.940 --> 02:03:02.480
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aside from billy on the street.</v>

3155
02:03:02.481 --> 02:03:05.330
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the version of it that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel like it's like he's had those</v>

3156
02:03:05.331 --> 02:03:07.170
<v Speaker 3>people get to have fun with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Billy on the street.</v>

3157
02:03:07.190 --> 02:03:09.780
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>billy eichner never wash that.</v>

3158
02:03:09.860 --> 02:03:11.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just whenever I see that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

3159
02:03:11.420 --> 02:03:12.860
<v Speaker 3>he sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the joke.</v>

3160
02:03:13.250 --> 02:03:14.001
<v Speaker 3>He's not making,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3161
02:03:14.001 --> 02:03:15.590
<v Speaker 3>it's not like the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what year was the war of 18,</v>

3162
02:03:15.591 --> 02:03:16.550
<v Speaker 3>12.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You idiot,</v>

3163
02:03:16.551 --> 02:03:20.120
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I feel like I'd only seen it that</v>

3164
02:03:20.121 --> 02:03:21.700
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I did,</v>

3165
02:03:21.740 --> 02:03:22.730
<v Speaker 3>when I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was always like,</v>

3166
02:03:22.731 --> 02:03:24.230
<v Speaker 3>just trying to like let them talk.</v>

3167
02:03:24.260 --> 02:03:26.940
<v Speaker 3>And then if they got the joke I would</v>
<v Speaker 3>tag the joke or if I thought of</v>

3168
02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:29.240
<v Speaker 3>something funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't necessarily against them.</v>

3169
02:03:29.241 --> 02:03:31.460
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was about something situation that</v>

3170
02:03:31.461 --> 02:03:34.490
<v Speaker 3>was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that trained me for united</v>

3171
02:03:34.510 --> 02:03:36.350
<v Speaker 3>shades,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the United States with the show.</v>

3172
02:03:36.351 --> 02:03:38.150
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the only show I could</v>

3173
02:03:38.151 --> 02:03:39.140
<v Speaker 3>ever do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I can't,</v>

3174
02:03:39.170 --> 02:03:41.420
<v Speaker 3>there's not other shows in me where I</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be on camera like that.</v>

3175
02:03:41.421 --> 02:03:42.740
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not an actor.</v>

3176
02:03:42.741 --> 02:03:44.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to get a sitcom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not.</v>

3177
02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:46.680
<v Speaker 3>There's always a refreshing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3178
02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:51.230
<v Speaker 3>I just don't have any interest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to audition for movies.</v>

3179
02:03:51.231 --> 02:03:52.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't audition for anything good for</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

3180
02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:54.200
<v Speaker 3>Live in Berkeley,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't even,</v>

3181
02:03:54.201 --> 02:03:55.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even available to audition for</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

3182
02:03:56.160 --> 02:03:57.200
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

3183
02:03:57.470 --> 02:03:58.610
<v Speaker 3>but this I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3184
02:03:58.611 --> 02:04:01.040
<v Speaker 3>it's this or versions of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the thing was,</v>

3185
02:04:01.460 --> 02:04:05.450
<v Speaker 3>it was basically in my mind it was based</v>
<v Speaker 3>on like the board Dane model and Morgan</v>

3186
02:04:05.451 --> 02:04:08.420
<v Speaker 3>spurlock's work and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like even like Michael Moore's work</v>

3187
02:04:08.421 --> 02:04:11.090
<v Speaker 3>where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those things are about them that like</v>

3188
02:04:11.150 --> 02:04:12.950
<v Speaker 3>when you watch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about,</v>

3189
02:04:13.190 --> 02:04:16.820
<v Speaker 3>it's about this person and you'd watch</v>
<v Speaker 3>board if you'd like more day and you'd</v>

3190
02:04:16.821 --> 02:04:17.720
<v Speaker 3>watch them do anything.</v>

3191
02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:19.450
<v Speaker 3>It's not just about where he's going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like about,</v>

3192
02:04:19.470 --> 02:04:21.620
<v Speaker 3>I just want to hang out with this dude</v>
<v Speaker 3>for an hour because I feel like with</v>

3193
02:04:21.910 --> 02:04:24.680
<v Speaker 3>with united shades,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more it becomes that I just want to</v>

3194
02:04:24.681 --> 02:04:26.930
<v Speaker 3>able to come out for an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that's the show I want it to be.</v>

3195
02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:28.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you figured out a way to do it,</v>

3196
02:04:28.731 --> 02:04:31.100
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Kudos to CNN for allowing you to</v>

3197
02:04:31.101 --> 02:04:32.330
<v Speaker 3>just be yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3198
02:04:32.331 --> 02:04:35.000
<v Speaker 3>There's people always ask all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much pushback do you get?</v>

3199
02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:37.990
<v Speaker 3>I think the most pushback we got last</v>
<v Speaker 3>season was I had.</v>

3200
02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:39.780
<v Speaker 3>We had to fart jokes in the show and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

3201
02:04:39.781 --> 02:04:41.010
<v Speaker 3>you have to pick one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can</v>

3202
02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:44.450
<v Speaker 3>was pretty fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3203
02:04:44.480 --> 02:04:46.070
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their different fart jokes.</v>

3204
02:04:47.470 --> 02:04:50.160
<v Speaker 3>I didn't intentionally right to fart</v>
<v Speaker 3>jokes in the show.</v>

3205
02:04:50.161 --> 02:04:51.870
<v Speaker 3>It just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had presented with two opportunities</v>

3206
02:04:51.871 --> 02:04:53.340
<v Speaker 3>before jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>

3207
02:04:53.340 --> 02:04:54.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was like.</v>

3208
02:04:54.440 --> 02:04:56.580
<v Speaker 3>So they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's never like.</v>

3209
02:04:56.610 --> 02:04:58.530
<v Speaker 3>They actually did not want to be clear</v>
<v Speaker 3>on this.</v>

3210
02:04:58.560 --> 02:05:00.750
<v Speaker 3>They want the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm always want the show to be smarter.</v>

3211
02:05:00.751 --> 02:05:03.310
<v Speaker 3>They want the show to be smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want the facts to be vetted and clear.</v>

3212
02:05:03.311 --> 02:05:05.730
<v Speaker 3>They want that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want the journalistic integrity</v>

3213
02:05:05.731 --> 02:05:08.540
<v Speaker 3>because it's on a news network,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't pitch angles like they,</v>

3214
02:05:08.550 --> 02:05:09.390
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were like,</v>

3215
02:05:09.870 --> 02:05:11.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you thought about doing anything</v>

3216
02:05:11.011 --> 02:05:13.140
<v Speaker 3>with Asian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Asian American community.</v>

3217
02:05:13.141 --> 02:05:14.350
<v Speaker 3>That was what they said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

3218
02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:16.110
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to talk about Chinatown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean,</v>

3219
02:05:16.111 --> 02:05:20.250
<v Speaker 3>so that I get to take their suggestion</v>
<v Speaker 3>and put it into a and put it into my</v>

3220
02:05:20.251 --> 02:05:21.810
<v Speaker 3>version of it and that in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

3221
02:05:21.940 --> 02:05:24.780
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to take it to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chinatown in San Francisco so I can film</v>

3222
02:05:24.781 --> 02:05:28.190
<v Speaker 3>an episode near my house and I have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>travel and I'd like to meet Shannon Lee.</v>

3223
02:05:28.650 --> 02:05:30.920
<v Speaker 3>Can we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did Shannon Lietz Lee's daughter?</v>

3224
02:05:30.930 --> 02:05:31.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3225
02:05:31.720 --> 02:05:32.491
<v Speaker 3>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3226
02:05:32.491 --> 02:05:35.610
<v Speaker 3>So it was like I got to make the version</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the show I wanted while at the same</v>

3227
02:05:35.611 --> 02:05:37.740
<v Speaker 3>time talking about the history of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chinatown and doing this other thing,</v>

3228
02:05:37.980 --> 02:05:39.530
<v Speaker 3>but it ended with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The last line is like,</v>

3229
02:05:39.840 --> 02:05:41.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really learned a lot this week.</v>

3230
02:05:41.310 --> 02:05:42.990
<v Speaker 3>Who am I kidding?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just wanted to become friends with</v>

3231
02:05:42.991 --> 02:05:46.110
<v Speaker 3>Shane and leave it because I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedian.</v>

3232
02:05:46.111 --> 02:05:48.300
<v Speaker 3>I can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have some sort of like,</v>

3233
02:05:48.301 --> 02:05:50.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this and I sort of sometimes the people</v>

3234
02:05:50.911 --> 02:05:52.890
<v Speaker 3>who write like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because people will write parts of the</v>

3235
02:05:52.891 --> 02:05:55.890
<v Speaker 3>show and they will write it like the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>journalists would do it this week.</v>

3236
02:05:55.891 --> 02:05:58.970
<v Speaker 3>I've learned that people come together</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's some of that that's still I</v>

3237
02:05:59.020 --> 02:06:03.510
<v Speaker 3>have to keep sort of pulling out like</v>
<v Speaker 3>right to do write monologues or do you</v>

3238
02:06:03.511 --> 02:06:06.600
<v Speaker 3>just talk a there?</v>

3239
02:06:06.660 --> 02:06:08.250
<v Speaker 3>What happens is like with somebody they</v>
<v Speaker 3>will,</v>

3240
02:06:08.251 --> 02:06:10.590
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like sort of the version of the script</v>

3241
02:06:10.830 --> 02:06:14.250
<v Speaker 3>and then I will get that and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I will pull whole sections out</v>

3242
02:06:14.251 --> 02:06:16.530
<v Speaker 3>and then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then once we get into the Vo booth,</v>

3243
02:06:16.860 --> 02:06:19.800
<v Speaker 3>it's me and usually a couple of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedians like Ethan Berlin,</v>

3244
02:06:20.170 --> 02:06:21.690
<v Speaker 3>a drawn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gee,</v>

3245
02:06:21.691 --> 02:06:24.510
<v Speaker 3>this season's gonna be doing Kennedy who</v>
<v Speaker 3>will then we'll sit in the.</v>

3246
02:06:24.730 --> 02:06:27.180
<v Speaker 3>We'll will be on the phone together on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Vo booth and sort of like riff other</v>

3247
02:06:27.181 --> 02:06:27.990
<v Speaker 3>things out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3248
02:06:27.990 --> 02:06:30.820
<v Speaker 3>So it's great to actually be able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>hire because I had to clear with seeing</v>

3249
02:06:31.050 --> 02:06:34.380
<v Speaker 3>I need to hire comedians on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can't just be me and the news people</v>

3250
02:06:34.381 --> 02:06:37.110
<v Speaker 3>or the TV people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it seems like it's not just a show,</v>

3251
02:06:37.111 --> 02:06:41.160
<v Speaker 3>but also an opportunity for you to just</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of broaden your experience with</v>

3252
02:06:41.161 --> 02:06:41.994
<v Speaker 3>human beings.</v>

3253
02:06:42.390 --> 02:06:44.550
<v Speaker 3>Which is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we went to Barrow,</v>

3254
02:06:44.550 --> 02:06:46.740
<v Speaker 3>Alaska in the first season.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>

3255
02:06:46.741 --> 02:06:49.590
<v Speaker 3>Where is that at?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The northern most tip of Alaska.</v>

3256
02:06:50.010 --> 02:06:53.670
<v Speaker 3>It's inside the Arctic Circle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ci's nobody visits barrel.</v>

3257
02:06:53.700 --> 02:06:56.070
<v Speaker 3>Like it's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not like a parts of Alaska where like</v>

3258
02:06:56.071 --> 02:06:56.820
<v Speaker 3>anchorage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well No,</v>

3259
02:06:56.820 --> 02:06:58.980
<v Speaker 3>let's go visit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a place where it doesn't do</v>

3260
02:06:58.981 --> 02:07:02.070
<v Speaker 3>tourism you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you could go but there's nothing</v>

3261
02:07:02.071 --> 02:07:03.130
<v Speaker 3>to do there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just some of the year.</v>

3262
02:07:03.131 --> 02:07:04.380
<v Speaker 3>Did you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went in,</v>

3263
02:07:04.410 --> 02:07:05.243
<v Speaker 3>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

3264
02:07:05.590 --> 02:07:08.040
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was spring in the rest of America,</v>

3265
02:07:08.041 --> 02:07:09.180
<v Speaker 3>but it was still like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3266
02:07:09.390 --> 02:07:11.770
<v Speaker 3>deep snow on the ground and frozen and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was like,</v>

3267
02:07:11.880 --> 02:07:13.750
<v Speaker 3>it was like negative toward his right</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

3268
02:07:13.780 --> 02:07:18.240
<v Speaker 3>Choose inside the Arctic Circle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we actually walked so far north</v>

3269
02:07:18.270 --> 02:07:20.940
<v Speaker 3>that we were on the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was still frozen,</v>

3270
02:07:21.080 --> 02:07:21.913
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3271
02:07:22.500 --> 02:07:26.310
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're on the ocean.</v>

3272
02:07:26.310 --> 02:07:27.270
<v Speaker 3>And it was just still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3273
02:07:27.271 --> 02:07:29.940
<v Speaker 3>we were like on standing on the water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did you do there?</v>

3274
02:07:30.050 --> 02:07:31.820
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the idea that,</v>

3275
02:07:32.510 --> 02:07:34.410
<v Speaker 3>well that was the idea because we just</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have here where,</v>

3276
02:07:34.411 --> 02:07:35.500
<v Speaker 3>where have you never been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3277
02:07:35.501 --> 02:07:37.690
<v Speaker 3>sometimes that's how we for if you've</v>
<v Speaker 3>never been right,</v>

3278
02:07:37.860 --> 02:07:39.700
<v Speaker 3>we should go to Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well isn't that just go to regular</v>

3279
02:07:39.701 --> 02:07:40.534
<v Speaker 3>Alaska?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's go,</v>

3280
02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:44.380
<v Speaker 3>let's go to the part of Alaska that even</v>
<v Speaker 3>that even like we went to anchorage for</v>

3281
02:07:44.381 --> 02:07:46.860
<v Speaker 3>part of it and even Alaskans don't go to</v>
<v Speaker 3>barrow because there's,</v>

3282
02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:48.820
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a place where people go there to</v>

3283
02:07:48.821 --> 02:07:52.150
<v Speaker 3>work for the oil companies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People work for companies that work for</v>

3284
02:07:52.151 --> 02:07:53.770
<v Speaker 3>the old company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not like.</v>

3285
02:07:54.050 --> 02:07:56.800
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's a camp to camp,</v>

3286
02:07:56.830 --> 02:07:57.551
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3287
02:07:57.551 --> 02:08:01.690
<v Speaker 3>it's 4,000 people in Anchorage is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird community anchorage.</v>

3288
02:08:01.810 --> 02:08:03.640
<v Speaker 3>When I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the first things I saw when we</v>

3289
02:08:03.641 --> 02:08:07.930
<v Speaker 3>were driving a rental car to the hotel</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a group of people standing on the</v>

3290
02:08:07.931 --> 02:08:10.360
<v Speaker 3>corner holding up signs saying honk for</v>
<v Speaker 3>equality</v>

3291
02:08:11.970 --> 02:08:16.030
<v Speaker 3>and all these people were honking as</v>
<v Speaker 3>they drove by and there was like all</v>

3292
02:08:16.031 --> 02:08:18.100
<v Speaker 3>these people with purple hair and shit.</v>

3293
02:08:18.100 --> 02:08:19.270
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3294
02:08:19.271 --> 02:08:20.620
<v Speaker 3>this is like a real city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3295
02:08:20.621 --> 02:08:21.454
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anchorage has.</v>

3296
02:08:21.580 --> 02:08:23.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like Bakersfield.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

3297
02:08:24.150 --> 02:08:25.270
<v Speaker 3>it's cool when I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3298
02:08:25.271 --> 02:08:25.990
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a,</v>

3299
02:08:25.990 --> 02:08:27.790
<v Speaker 3>it's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you don't.</v>

3300
02:08:28.750 --> 02:08:29.950
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only thing was it was,</v>

3301
02:08:30.010 --> 02:08:31.960
<v Speaker 3>it was cold but it wasn't even colder in</v>
<v Speaker 3>other place.</v>

3302
02:08:31.961 --> 02:08:33.790
<v Speaker 3>And there was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was more salmon choices,</v>

3303
02:08:33.791 --> 02:08:36.370
<v Speaker 3>like everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everywhere you went they were like.</v>

3304
02:08:36.430 --> 02:08:38.410
<v Speaker 3>And we have salmon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Halibut.</v>

3305
02:08:38.411 --> 02:08:38.901
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3306
02:08:38.901 --> 02:08:40.900
<v Speaker 3>And we have jerky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>salmon jerky.</v>

3307
02:08:40.901 --> 02:08:42.100
<v Speaker 3>So it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

3308
02:08:42.101 --> 02:08:44.250
<v Speaker 3>that's why I'm glad we went to barrow</v>
<v Speaker 3>because Barrow is like,</v>

3309
02:08:44.470 --> 02:08:46.810
<v Speaker 3>like I loved it and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll never come back here again.</v>

3310
02:08:46.930 --> 02:08:51.640
<v Speaker 3>Like there's no way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless I was doing something and you</v>

3311
02:08:51.641 --> 02:08:52.510
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that for me,</v>

3312
02:08:52.700 --> 02:08:55.480
<v Speaker 3>like that's what is fun and that episode</v>
<v Speaker 3>was people like that episode a lot.</v>

3313
02:08:55.480 --> 02:08:57.640
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was because it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes people think the episode,</v>

3314
02:08:57.641 --> 02:08:59.260
<v Speaker 3>the show is just me talking to scary</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

3315
02:08:59.290 --> 02:09:02.830
<v Speaker 3>but most of the show is just me talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>to people that I've never talked to</v>

3316
02:09:02.831 --> 02:09:04.660
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just getting a chance to see America.</v>

3317
02:09:04.750 --> 02:09:05.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>

3318
02:09:05.681 --> 02:09:07.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we did an episode about Lucy,</v>

3319
02:09:07.340 --> 02:09:08.560
<v Speaker 3>some of Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like,</v>

3320
02:09:08.740 --> 02:09:11.680
<v Speaker 3>well that's a big topic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we went to Hamtramck in Dearborn,</v>

3321
02:09:11.681 --> 02:09:15.010
<v Speaker 3>Michigan at this super small town,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the highest percentage of Arabs and</v>

3322
02:09:15.011 --> 02:09:17.560
<v Speaker 3>Muslims in America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 30 percent Arabs and Muslim in this</v>

3323
02:09:17.561 --> 02:09:20.980
<v Speaker 3>town and it's like a sleepy suburb where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just happen to see lots of women in</v>

3324
02:09:20.981 --> 02:09:23.200
<v Speaker 3>Hijab walking around like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3325
02:09:23.710 --> 02:09:25.270
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you sort of feel like,</v>

3326
02:09:25.271 --> 02:09:26.410
<v Speaker 3>is this right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

3327
02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:28.330
<v Speaker 3>This seems weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>

3328
02:09:28.331 --> 02:09:31.810
<v Speaker 3>it's just a sleepy suburb outside of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Detroit or inside of Detroit.</v>

3329
02:09:31.810 --> 02:09:34.480
<v Speaker 3>There's ham generics in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Detroit and it's just this small town</v>

3330
02:09:34.481 --> 02:09:36.260
<v Speaker 3>that happens to be because of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3331
02:09:36.610 --> 02:09:38.680
<v Speaker 3>the Ford factory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some of the things that happens a</v>

3332
02:09:38.681 --> 02:09:41.650
<v Speaker 3>lot with immigrants like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the Ford factory was okay hiring</v>

3333
02:09:41.651 --> 02:09:43.840
<v Speaker 3>immigrants back in the day or Muslims</v>
<v Speaker 3>back in the day.</v>

3334
02:09:43.930 --> 02:09:45.790
<v Speaker 3>So the Muslims were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody come here.</v>

3335
02:09:46.080 --> 02:09:49.750
<v Speaker 3>And so then it became a very popular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very populous Arab Muslim town.</v>

3336
02:09:49.751 --> 02:09:51.460
<v Speaker 3>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I got to sit down with a woman,</v>

3337
02:09:51.730 --> 02:09:54.610
<v Speaker 3>her name was [inaudible] and I just got</v>
<v Speaker 3>to ask her all the dumb questions about</v>

3338
02:09:54.611 --> 02:09:56.710
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about Islam and all the dumb questions</v>

3339
02:09:56.711 --> 02:09:59.860
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about her job and in Burkas and you</v>

3340
02:09:59.861 --> 02:10:01.870
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and how that works with feminism.</v>

3341
02:10:01.871 --> 02:10:05.170
<v Speaker 3>Can you be a feminist and a Muslim woman</v>
<v Speaker 3>who can you be a feminist and a woman</v>

3342
02:10:05.171 --> 02:10:06.220
<v Speaker 3>who is wearing a burka?</v>

3343
02:10:06.220 --> 02:10:06.731
<v Speaker 3>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3344
02:10:06.731 --> 02:10:07.840
<v Speaker 3>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a choice,</v>

3345
02:10:07.990 --> 02:10:09.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3346
02:10:09.180 --> 02:10:09.981
<v Speaker 3>so I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

3347
02:10:09.981 --> 02:10:11.950
<v Speaker 3>So I think that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we got to talk about,</v>

3348
02:10:11.951 --> 02:10:13.090
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about in Saudi Arabia?</v>

3349
02:10:13.091 --> 02:10:14.830
<v Speaker 3>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government of Saudi Arabia does a</v>

3350
02:10:14.831 --> 02:10:17.680
<v Speaker 3>lot of shit that's wrong and they use</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam as a way to justify it.</v>

3351
02:10:17.681 --> 02:10:19.690
<v Speaker 3>Just like the way the American</v>
<v Speaker 3>government does a lot of shit that's</v>

3352
02:10:19.691 --> 02:10:22.930
<v Speaker 3>wrong and says God and country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not about the religion,</v>

3353
02:10:22.931 --> 02:10:24.340
<v Speaker 3>it's about the expression of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>religion.</v>

3354
02:10:24.341 --> 02:10:25.174
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3355
02:10:25.180 --> 02:10:27.550
<v Speaker 3>for me it's like to be able to ask those</v>
<v Speaker 3>dumb questions.</v>

3356
02:10:27.551 --> 02:10:29.680
<v Speaker 3>We got to go to standing rock in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>middle of standing rock.</v>

3357
02:10:29.681 --> 02:10:32.180
<v Speaker 3>And so while it was going through the</v>
<v Speaker 3>pipeline,</v>

3358
02:10:32.350 --> 02:10:33.260
<v Speaker 3>the height of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3359
02:10:33.290 --> 02:10:34.460
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was that like?</v>

3360
02:10:34.610 --> 02:10:36.080
<v Speaker 3>Did you get hosed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3361
02:10:36.140 --> 02:10:38.510
<v Speaker 3>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was there for a few hours.</v>

3362
02:10:38.540 --> 02:10:41.450
<v Speaker 3>This was not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was the sort of at the big sort of</v>

3363
02:10:41.451 --> 02:10:43.100
<v Speaker 3>the first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>third of it I guess.</v>

3364
02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:45.960
<v Speaker 3>So it was still not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had not turned into that and we were</v>

3365
02:10:45.980 --> 02:10:49.640
<v Speaker 3>very disturbing time because they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>going through people's public or private</v>

3366
02:10:49.641 --> 02:10:50.780
<v Speaker 3>land and they were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3367
02:10:50.781 --> 02:10:52.400
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going through and,</v>

3368
02:10:52.430 --> 02:10:54.290
<v Speaker 3>but what is private land then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3369
02:10:54.470 --> 02:10:58.190
<v Speaker 3>if you just can decide to have your</v>
<v Speaker 3>business go through my land and dig a</v>

3370
02:10:58.191 --> 02:11:01.700
<v Speaker 3>fucking pipeline that may or may not</v>
<v Speaker 3>poisoned my wells if everything goes</v>

3371
02:11:01.701 --> 02:11:03.290
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is public land?</v>

3372
02:11:03.291 --> 02:11:06.710
<v Speaker 3>What does private is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it all the governments land or they</v>

3373
02:11:06.711 --> 02:11:09.500
<v Speaker 3>just usurping my private land like this</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of fucking.</v>

3374
02:11:09.620 --> 02:11:10.820
<v Speaker 3>The native people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3375
02:11:10.821 --> 02:11:12.290
<v Speaker 3>this is what they do to us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what.</v>

3376
02:11:12.291 --> 02:11:13.360
<v Speaker 3>This is how they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3377
02:11:13.500 --> 02:11:15.680
<v Speaker 3>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever the whatever the number of</v>

3378
02:11:15.681 --> 02:11:16.940
<v Speaker 3>treaties that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because people get.</v>

3379
02:11:16.941 --> 02:11:19.040
<v Speaker 3>There's like several hundred treaties</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're like,</v>

3380
02:11:19.041 --> 02:11:22.010
<v Speaker 3>they've broken all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like not like half of them they say</v>

3381
02:11:22.011 --> 02:11:25.570
<v Speaker 3>they've broken all of the treaties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the native American people,</v>

3382
02:11:25.820 --> 02:11:28.190
<v Speaker 3>that's why they had to make a big noise</v>
<v Speaker 3>because like this is how they do and</v>

3383
02:11:28.191 --> 02:11:30.680
<v Speaker 3>this was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it felt like the final Straw and so they</v>

3384
02:11:30.690 --> 02:11:32.890
<v Speaker 3>were people like we got there before the</v>
<v Speaker 3>winter and they were like,</v>

3385
02:11:32.900 --> 02:11:34.550
<v Speaker 3>there's people in tps were like it.</v>

3386
02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:37.220
<v Speaker 3>I had this whole conversation about how</v>
<v Speaker 3>tb beefs think of Tbi.</v>

3387
02:11:37.460 --> 02:11:39.800
<v Speaker 3>I thought if teepees is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have teepees in the</v>

3388
02:11:39.801 --> 02:11:40.491
<v Speaker 3>winter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like yeah,</v>

3389
02:11:40.491 --> 02:11:41.890
<v Speaker 3>they're better than tense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they're just,</v>

3390
02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:44.380
<v Speaker 3>this is a hole in the top and you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a fire in the middle of.</v>

3391
02:11:44.410 --> 02:11:45.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew you would know,</v>

3392
02:11:46.740 --> 02:11:47.580
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>

3393
02:11:47.581 --> 02:11:48.710
<v Speaker 3>And this guy was like,</v>

3394
02:11:48.711 --> 02:11:50.660
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I said to this one guy,</v>

3395
02:11:50.661 --> 02:11:50.961
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3396
02:11:50.961 --> 02:11:52.580
<v Speaker 3>what do you do if it gets really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really cold?</v>

3397
02:11:52.670 --> 02:11:54.350
<v Speaker 3>Go to the hotel down the street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3398
02:11:54.780 --> 02:11:56.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's just like I was in this whole</v>

3399
02:11:56.721 --> 02:12:00.360
<v Speaker 3>like native</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we go to,</v>

3400
02:12:00.450 --> 02:12:01.760
<v Speaker 3>we go to the restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

3401
02:12:01.761 --> 02:12:03.400
<v Speaker 3>So it's like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was.</v>

3402
02:12:03.480 --> 02:12:05.930
<v Speaker 3>That was one of my favorite episodes</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I get to sit and ask all the</v>

3403
02:12:05.931 --> 02:12:09.020
<v Speaker 3>dumb questions that I've had and other</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have and sometimes I ask dumb</v>

3404
02:12:09.021 --> 02:12:10.250
<v Speaker 3>questions that I kind of know the answer</v>
<v Speaker 3>to you.</v>

3405
02:12:10.250 --> 02:12:12.770
<v Speaker 3>Would that be like we need to ask the</v>
<v Speaker 3>dumb question when we have an</v>

3406
02:12:12.771 --> 02:12:16.430
<v Speaker 3>opportunity to don't go tap into people</v>
<v Speaker 3>in line at starbucks and asking them</v>

3407
02:12:16.431 --> 02:12:18.320
<v Speaker 3>dumb questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got the Dakota pipeline was</v>

3408
02:12:18.321 --> 02:12:22.670
<v Speaker 3>extremely disturbing and it just because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just was one of the clearest</v>

3409
02:12:22.671 --> 02:12:27.320
<v Speaker 3>examples of money overwrites,</v>
<v Speaker 3>money over land ownership,</v>

3410
02:12:27.321 --> 02:12:30.530
<v Speaker 3>money over everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going through with this thing.</v>

3411
02:12:30.531 --> 02:12:33.140
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna make us money and this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we're going to do.</v>

3412
02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:35.630
<v Speaker 3>You should get Tara.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tara Houska on here.</v>

3413
02:12:35.640 --> 02:12:37.400
<v Speaker 3>She's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was at standing rock and she speaks</v>

3414
02:12:37.401 --> 02:12:40.370
<v Speaker 3>very awesome about all this stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's a hardcore activist.</v>

3415
02:12:40.371 --> 02:12:42.530
<v Speaker 3>She was one of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was like Bernie Sanders,</v>

3416
02:12:42.531 --> 02:12:44.840
<v Speaker 3>native American,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the representative,</v>

3417
02:12:44.900 --> 02:12:46.850
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she's great about all this stuff and</v>

3418
02:12:46.851 --> 02:12:48.440
<v Speaker 3>you can talk about how to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3419
02:12:48.441 --> 02:12:51.560
<v Speaker 3>this is just the most recent expression</v>
<v Speaker 3>of this.</v>

3420
02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:56.920
<v Speaker 3>Spell her name t a r t a r a h o u s k</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is,</v>

3421
02:12:57.770 --> 02:12:58.603
<v Speaker 3>there she is.</v>

3422
02:12:59.170 --> 02:12:59.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

3423
02:12:59.630 --> 02:13:02.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean she was in the episode and when</v>
<v Speaker 3>we sat down I was like,</v>

3424
02:13:02.360 --> 02:13:03.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to ask you a bunch of dumb</v>
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>

3425
02:13:03.770 --> 02:13:04.401
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>

3426
02:13:04.401 --> 02:13:08.150
<v Speaker 3>Here we go and talked about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is just the tip of the iceberg.</v>

3427
02:13:08.180 --> 02:13:09.860
<v Speaker 3>Where is that now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's that standard?</v>

3428
02:13:09.900 --> 02:13:11.480
<v Speaker 3>Because when trump got in office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he paid,</v>

3429
02:13:11.500 --> 02:13:13.940
<v Speaker 3>apparently greenlit everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's still people fighting against</v>

3430
02:13:13.941 --> 02:13:15.050
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not the same,</v>

3431
02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:16.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>number of people out there,</v>

3432
02:13:16.761 --> 02:13:18.790
<v Speaker 3>but they're still active.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She will be able to tell you more better</v>

3433
02:13:18.791 --> 02:13:19.730
<v Speaker 3>than I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're still,</v>

3434
02:13:20.090 --> 02:13:21.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're still the same.</v>

3435
02:13:21.110 --> 02:13:22.940
<v Speaker 3>There's still people fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're going through it anyway.</v>

3436
02:13:22.941 --> 02:13:24.580
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going right under the river.</v>

3437
02:13:24.590 --> 02:13:27.020
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is where it gets a little bit out</v>

3438
02:13:27.021 --> 02:13:28.160
<v Speaker 3>of my depth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah.</v>

3439
02:13:28.190 --> 02:13:29.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is there,</v>

3440
02:13:29.350 --> 02:13:32.010
<v Speaker 3>what was like the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't think there's any one</v>

3441
02:13:32.011 --> 02:13:34.500
<v Speaker 3>thing that was most rewarding to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was anything that you got the</v>

3442
02:13:34.501 --> 02:13:37.200
<v Speaker 3>most out of during that show during the</v>
<v Speaker 3>native Americans,</v>

3443
02:13:37.201 --> 02:13:38.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing your show.</v>

3444
02:13:38.790 --> 02:13:40.450
<v Speaker 3>United States of America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3445
02:13:40.710 --> 02:13:42.780
<v Speaker 3>the bay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the San Quentin episode is actually the</v>

3446
02:13:42.781 --> 02:13:46.110
<v Speaker 3>one that I feel like has actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>affected me the deepest that I've been</v>

3447
02:13:46.111 --> 02:13:48.300
<v Speaker 3>back to St Winton twice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe three times,</v>

3448
02:13:48.330 --> 02:13:51.110
<v Speaker 3>twice since then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I cohosted it like a talent showcase</v>

3449
02:13:51.210 --> 02:13:52.470
<v Speaker 3>with one of the inmates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

3450
02:13:52.530 --> 02:13:54.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were like on stage together,</v>

3451
02:13:54.001 --> 02:13:56.880
<v Speaker 3>like he wrote bits for us to do and yet</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was ripping,</v>

3452
02:13:56.910 --> 02:13:57.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's this thing where like,</v>

3453
02:13:57.960 --> 02:14:00.330
<v Speaker 3>believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though I had gone to San Quintin</v>

3454
02:14:00.331 --> 02:14:02.250
<v Speaker 3>and filmed either,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to St coat and film the show.</v>

3455
02:14:02.251 --> 02:14:04.050
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I walked in like this is,</v>

3456
02:14:04.060 --> 02:14:06.470
<v Speaker 3>this was in the episode.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I walked in with the,</v>

3457
02:14:06.570 --> 02:14:08.780
<v Speaker 3>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the coordinator,</v>

3458
02:14:08.790 --> 02:14:10.240
<v Speaker 3>the junior warden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to guess,</v>

3459
02:14:10.710 --> 02:14:12.360
<v Speaker 3>and Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was like,</v>

3460
02:14:12.361 --> 02:14:14.220
<v Speaker 3>we walk in to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the yard,</v>

3461
02:14:14.221 --> 02:14:15.100
<v Speaker 3>and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you feel?</v>

3462
02:14:15.101 --> 02:14:16.800
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we're walking into the yard</v>

3463
02:14:16.830 --> 02:14:17.251
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3464
02:14:17.251 --> 02:14:20.730
<v Speaker 3>and it's all inmates doing sit ups and</v>
<v Speaker 3>pushups and hanging out playing</v>

3465
02:14:20.731 --> 02:14:21.750
<v Speaker 3>basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

3466
02:14:21.751 --> 02:14:22.490
<v Speaker 3>how's it feel like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3467
02:14:22.490 --> 02:14:24.630
<v Speaker 3>it feels like walk into a neighborhood</v>
<v Speaker 3>that don't know anybody.</v>

3468
02:14:24.631 --> 02:14:25.890
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if one of the neighbors were,</v>

3469
02:14:25.891 --> 02:14:27.300
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to be careful here.</v>

3470
02:14:27.630 --> 02:14:29.390
<v Speaker 3>And then as I was saying that some guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes,</v>

3471
02:14:29.430 --> 02:14:31.080
<v Speaker 3>love your comedy Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>

3472
02:14:31.140 --> 02:14:32.040
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it feels pretty good.</v>

3473
02:14:34.410 --> 02:14:35.930
<v Speaker 3>And it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then that's exactly what happened.</v>

3474
02:14:35.931 --> 02:14:39.450
<v Speaker 3>And we left it in the show and then from</v>
<v Speaker 3>that point forward it was just like if</v>

3475
02:14:39.451 --> 02:14:41.220
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you like sort of close your eyes,</v>

3476
02:14:41.250 --> 02:14:45.440
<v Speaker 3>it was just talking mostly to black men</v>
<v Speaker 3>who've had a lot of life experience and</v>

3477
02:14:45.450 --> 02:14:47.840
<v Speaker 3>been through a lot of shit and who have</v>
<v Speaker 3>learned a lot from them,</v>

3478
02:14:47.850 --> 02:14:51.480
<v Speaker 3>what they went through and have like</v>
<v Speaker 3>done therapy and self actualized and</v>

3479
02:14:51.720 --> 02:14:53.520
<v Speaker 3>educated themselves and all these types</v>
<v Speaker 3>of things.</v>

3480
02:14:53.790 --> 02:14:55.390
<v Speaker 3>And then if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you realize that I'm never</v>

3481
02:14:55.391 --> 02:14:56.870
<v Speaker 3>going to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a lot of experience out of</v>

3482
02:14:56.880 --> 02:14:57.660
<v Speaker 3>wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of knowledge,</v>

3483
02:14:57.660 --> 02:14:59.730
<v Speaker 3>a lot of skills and they're never going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to leave.</v>

3484
02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:03.120
<v Speaker 3>And so for me it was like I can do more</v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

3485
02:15:03.121 --> 02:15:04.790
<v Speaker 3>So I went back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we screened the episode there.</v>

3486
02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:07.290
<v Speaker 3>It was the most tense screening I ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>had because like what if they hate it,</v>

3487
02:15:07.650 --> 02:15:10.950
<v Speaker 3>but they were like cheering and clapping</v>
<v Speaker 3>and gave me a standing ovation at the</v>

3488
02:15:10.950 --> 02:15:11.370
<v Speaker 3>end.</v>

3489
02:15:11.370 --> 02:15:13.590
<v Speaker 3>And so I went back and hosted this</v>
<v Speaker 3>talent show.</v>

3490
02:15:13.591 --> 02:15:16.440
<v Speaker 3>And again I went back and still like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what if this time?</v>

3491
02:15:16.500 --> 02:15:17.340
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

3492
02:15:17.341 --> 02:15:18.840
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they make fun of me,</v>

3493
02:15:18.841 --> 02:15:20.440
<v Speaker 3>because I could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not pay A.</v>

3494
02:15:20.850 --> 02:15:22.770
<v Speaker 3>Was it a pinnacle?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were still,</v>

3495
02:15:22.771 --> 02:15:23.820
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to play peanuckle in prison.</v>

3496
02:15:23.821 --> 02:15:25.170
<v Speaker 3>I know how to play and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a black man.</v>

3497
02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:26.970
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't play peanuckle like they were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>

3498
02:15:28.130 --> 02:15:30.330
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just one of those crazy card games.</v>

3499
02:15:30.331 --> 02:15:32.280
<v Speaker 3>It's way too complicated that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the.</v>

3500
02:15:32.320 --> 02:15:34.980
<v Speaker 3>They said we play peanuckle because it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>really complicated and takes a lot of</v>

3501
02:15:34.981 --> 02:15:35.814
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

3502
02:15:38.190 --> 02:15:40.230
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to just play like war in</v>
<v Speaker 3>prison.</v>

3503
02:15:40.290 --> 02:15:43.770
<v Speaker 3>You want to play a game that's really</v>
<v Speaker 3>complicated so it actually sort of fills</v>

3504
02:15:43.771 --> 02:15:45.720
<v Speaker 3>the time you have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend who went to prison and</v>

3505
02:15:45.721 --> 02:15:47.610
<v Speaker 3>learned how to play chess in his head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3506
02:15:47.670 --> 02:15:52.670
<v Speaker 3>you can just yell out the Rook to King</v>
<v Speaker 3>Five checkmate him and this other kid</v>

3507
02:15:54.871 --> 02:15:59.460
<v Speaker 3>who was a chess genius or sitting down</v>
<v Speaker 3>this ex con and this chess genius</v>

3508
02:15:59.461 --> 02:16:01.330
<v Speaker 3>sitting down playing chess in their head</v>
<v Speaker 3>in front of me.</v>

3509
02:16:01.331 --> 02:16:02.250
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

3510
02:16:02.251 --> 02:16:03.930
<v Speaker 3>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it reminds me.</v>

3511
02:16:03.931 --> 02:16:06.480
<v Speaker 3>It's like the autobiography of Malcolm</v>
<v Speaker 3>X.</v>

3512
02:16:06.480 --> 02:16:08.490
<v Speaker 3>Malcolm x said there's all this wisdom</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the neighbor in the,</v>

3513
02:16:08.630 --> 02:16:12.000
<v Speaker 3>in the hood that these can be</v>
<v Speaker 3>mathematical geniuses,</v>

3514
02:16:12.390 --> 02:16:15.600
<v Speaker 3>these can be the people who cure cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they can't.</v>

3515
02:16:15.630 --> 02:16:18.590
<v Speaker 3>They're not being put in positions where</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can actually use.</v>

3516
02:16:18.730 --> 02:16:19.920
<v Speaker 3>You can take advantage of this.</v>

3517
02:16:20.100 --> 02:16:22.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also mistakes like whatever mistake</v>

3518
02:16:22.831 --> 02:16:26.850
<v Speaker 3>you make when you're a young person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's selling drugs or shooting a</v>

3519
02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:30.580
<v Speaker 3>gun in the air for your third offense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's certain mistakes that</v>

3520
02:16:30.880 --> 02:16:34.630
<v Speaker 3>automatically disqualify you from any</v>
<v Speaker 3>personal growth for the rest of your</v>

3521
02:16:34.631 --> 02:16:35.650
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's it.</v>

3522
02:16:36.130 --> 02:16:39.190
<v Speaker 3>Like you are now contained and</v>
<v Speaker 3>incarcerated.</v>

3523
02:16:39.191 --> 02:16:40.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there'll be no growth.</v>

3524
02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:42.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thing is the same.</v>

3525
02:16:42.310 --> 02:16:45.430
<v Speaker 3>It should be a really small list of</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that disqualify you from society</v>

3526
02:16:45.431 --> 02:16:47.140
<v Speaker 3>for the rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially like at 18.</v>

3527
02:16:47.290 --> 02:16:48.970
<v Speaker 3>It should be a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are things,</v>

3528
02:16:49.570 --> 02:16:51.720
<v Speaker 3>but it should be a pretty small finance</v>
<v Speaker 3>ministers.</v>

3529
02:16:51.730 --> 02:16:52.301
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it should be.</v>

3530
02:16:52.301 --> 02:16:54.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should be like you are a monster that</v>

3531
02:16:54.550 --> 02:16:56.390
<v Speaker 3>we should still check in with you every</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 every night.</v>

3532
02:16:56.391 --> 02:16:57.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you still a monster?</v>

3533
02:16:57.611 --> 02:17:01.420
<v Speaker 3>Like how's it going?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there a pill to being a monster?</v>

3534
02:17:01.480 --> 02:17:03.820
<v Speaker 3>If we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we sort of put you in therapy and</v>

3535
02:17:03.821 --> 02:17:05.140
<v Speaker 3>educate you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you still going to be a monster?</v>

3536
02:17:05.141 --> 02:17:06.820
<v Speaker 3>We should still be working on these</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

3537
02:17:07.060 --> 02:17:09.730
<v Speaker 3>but it's certainly not in a fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

3538
02:17:09.880 --> 02:17:12.940
<v Speaker 3>it's not for the betterment for society</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we've taken this huge pool of</v>

3539
02:17:12.941 --> 02:17:15.280
<v Speaker 3>people out of the prison system and as</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3540
02:17:15.281 --> 02:17:18.010
<v Speaker 3>this is the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Black people are like 12 percent of the</v>

3541
02:17:18.011 --> 02:17:20.620
<v Speaker 3>American population were 40 percent</v>
<v Speaker 3>American prison population.</v>

3542
02:17:20.621 --> 02:17:22.360
<v Speaker 3>Somewhere around there please google it</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes sure,</v>

3543
02:17:22.660 --> 02:17:25.780
<v Speaker 3>but it's not because we're doing 40</v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of the crime.</v>

3544
02:17:26.050 --> 02:17:29.830
<v Speaker 3>It's we black people do crime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're over sentenced a lot of times.</v>

3545
02:17:30.040 --> 02:17:32.980
<v Speaker 3>We're not getting proper representation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not A.</v>

3546
02:17:32.980 --> 02:17:35.740
<v Speaker 3>There's like the three strike laws,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's like something that like a white</v>

3547
02:17:35.741 --> 02:17:38.500
<v Speaker 3>guy in Nebraska does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A black guy doesn't California,</v>

3548
02:17:38.501 --> 02:17:39.640
<v Speaker 3>so he's in prison the rest of his life.</v>

3549
02:17:39.640 --> 02:17:41.830
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's like we're not getting the,</v>

3550
02:17:41.880 --> 02:17:45.700
<v Speaker 3>the unequal application of the law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which ends up putting us in prison at a</v>

3551
02:17:45.701 --> 02:17:47.800
<v Speaker 3>higher rate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And isn't there more people in</v>

3552
02:17:48.130 --> 02:17:53.130
<v Speaker 3>population in prison in America than the</v>
<v Speaker 3>rest of the world's presence in the.</v>

3553
02:17:53.990 --> 02:17:57.700
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the graph of like</v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans per the number of people in</v>

3554
02:17:57.701 --> 02:17:58.600
<v Speaker 3>prison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes like,</v>

3555
02:17:58.601 --> 02:18:00.190
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it stays pretty constant for a long</v>

3556
02:18:00.191 --> 02:18:01.620
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then like right around the 80 years</v>

3557
02:18:01.621 --> 02:18:03.190
<v Speaker 3>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have like some,</v>

3558
02:18:03.191 --> 02:18:05.290
<v Speaker 3>like somewhere between two and 3 million</v>
<v Speaker 3>people in prison.</v>

3559
02:18:05.350 --> 02:18:06.183
<v Speaker 3>The agent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes,</v>

3560
02:18:06.550 --> 02:18:07.660
<v Speaker 3>it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes,</v>

3561
02:18:07.700 --> 02:18:08.531
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can pull it up,</v>

3562
02:18:08.531 --> 02:18:10.650
<v Speaker 3>but he goes through laws that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that caused that to.</v>

3563
02:18:10.720 --> 02:18:14.050
<v Speaker 3>It's like mandatory minimums and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>incarcerated Americans.</v>

3564
02:18:14.080 --> 02:18:16.870
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that 1980 something.</v>

3565
02:18:17.230 --> 02:18:19.470
<v Speaker 3>It just launches straight up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3566
02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:21.190
<v Speaker 3>And it completely vertical on.</v>

3567
02:18:22.270 --> 02:18:24.130
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't like people were committing</v>

3568
02:18:24.131 --> 02:18:25.600
<v Speaker 3>the same crime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like man,</v>

3569
02:18:25.780 --> 02:18:29.170
<v Speaker 3>people just create so many more crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just about why we were keeping them</v>

3570
02:18:29.171 --> 02:18:30.730
<v Speaker 3>in prison longer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that shit.</v>

3571
02:18:30.760 --> 02:18:34.990
<v Speaker 3>In the 19 seventies it was less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at the number,</v>

3572
02:18:34.991 --> 02:18:37.540
<v Speaker 3>less than a million people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And let's talk about this,</v>

3573
02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:39.610
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about the 19 seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the Scorsese,</v>

3574
02:18:39.910 --> 02:18:44.910
<v Speaker 3>Scorsese movie at crime and crime is at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the streets of New York.</v>

3575
02:18:45.461 --> 02:18:50.170
<v Speaker 3>And then solid 1970,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks like like 400,000 people in</v>

3576
02:18:50.171 --> 02:18:50.920
<v Speaker 3>prison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3577
02:18:50.920 --> 02:18:54.010
<v Speaker 3>If that's half a million,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that looks like somewhere around</v>

3578
02:18:54.011 --> 02:18:56.890
<v Speaker 3>400,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking insane.</v>

3579
02:18:56.891 --> 02:18:59.050
<v Speaker 3>And now it's millions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

3580
02:18:59.051 --> 02:19:01.150
<v Speaker 3>it's not because crime got so much</v>
<v Speaker 3>worse.</v>

3581
02:19:01.180 --> 02:19:04.900
<v Speaker 3>It was that we started to private</v>
<v Speaker 3>prisons made it that we need to keep</v>

3582
02:19:04.901 --> 02:19:07.960
<v Speaker 3>people in here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to hold.</v>

3583
02:19:08.080 --> 02:19:10.510
<v Speaker 3>This is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're making money where this is a</v>

3584
02:19:10.570 --> 02:19:12.850
<v Speaker 3>moneymaking enterprise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we need to keep people in here.</v>

3585
02:19:13.030 --> 02:19:16.900
<v Speaker 3>The real problem is once you've got</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that going on,</v>

3586
02:19:17.140 --> 02:19:20.590
<v Speaker 3>pulling that back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be extremely difficult</v>

3587
02:19:20.620 --> 02:19:23.710
<v Speaker 3>when there's profit to be made from</v>
<v Speaker 3>incarcerating people.</v>

3588
02:19:24.490 --> 02:19:25.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mean there's the,</v>

3589
02:19:25.820 --> 02:19:26.950
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a guy,</v>

3590
02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:29.390
<v Speaker 3>Shane Bauer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard the name,</v>

3591
02:19:29.420 --> 02:19:31.100
<v Speaker 3>Shane Bauer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he works for Mother Jones magazine.</v>

3592
02:19:31.101 --> 02:19:33.110
<v Speaker 3>He was one of those guys that gets on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ground and.</v>

3593
02:19:33.111 --> 02:19:35.600
<v Speaker 3>But he did a whole thing where he was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>prison guard in Louisiana.</v>

3594
02:19:35.930 --> 02:19:38.810
<v Speaker 3>He applied for a job as a prison guard</v>
<v Speaker 3>at a for profit prison in Louisiana.</v>

3595
02:19:38.840 --> 02:19:39.920
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just for the story,</v>

3596
02:19:39.950 --> 02:19:41.990
<v Speaker 3>just for the story and didn't hide his</v>
<v Speaker 3>identity.</v>

3597
02:19:42.050 --> 02:19:43.820
<v Speaker 3>Where do you work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mother Jones magazine.</v>

3598
02:19:43.910 --> 02:19:46.160
<v Speaker 3>We.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need people like they didn't do any</v>

3599
02:19:46.161 --> 02:19:49.150
<v Speaker 3>sort of big background check and he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>a huge article.</v>

3600
02:19:49.151 --> 02:19:51.270
<v Speaker 3>He did a couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a year or so ago about being a</v>

3601
02:19:51.271 --> 02:19:52.130
<v Speaker 3>prison guard and it stayed.</v>

3602
02:19:52.140 --> 02:19:54.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you read it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the things you can get away</v>

3603
02:19:54.681 --> 02:19:57.560
<v Speaker 3>with when you are the prison guard and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ways in which you can treat people</v>

3604
02:19:57.561 --> 02:19:59.660
<v Speaker 3>at this prison in Louisiana are just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3605
02:19:59.661 --> 02:20:02.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a nightmare and this prison is</v>

3606
02:20:02.740 --> 02:20:06.620
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be about rehabilitation</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not.</v>

3607
02:20:06.700 --> 02:20:10.460
<v Speaker 3>And it's not and especially at a for</v>
<v Speaker 3>profit and for profit prisons that he's</v>

3608

<v Speaker 3>Please do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3610
02:20:14.260 --> 02:20:18.920
<v Speaker 3>The amount of money that they spend is</v>
<v Speaker 3>directly related to the amount of money</v>

3611
02:20:18.921 --> 02:20:21.590
<v Speaker 3>they earn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just trying to feed you with the</v>

3612
02:20:21.591 --> 02:20:24.230
<v Speaker 3>cheapest fucking food that can get into</v>
<v Speaker 3>what this is about.</v>

3613
02:20:24.231 --> 02:20:27.470
<v Speaker 3>And also it's about keeping you in line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not about keeping you,</v>

3614
02:20:27.910 --> 02:20:28.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not about,</v>

3615
02:20:28.610 --> 02:20:30.830
<v Speaker 3>it's not about helping you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about keeping you in La.</v>

3616
02:20:30.830 --> 02:20:32.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the San Quentin episode,</v>

3617
02:20:32.181 --> 02:20:35.270
<v Speaker 3>I went to the mess hall with him and got</v>
<v Speaker 3>and had the food,</v>

3618
02:20:35.300 --> 02:20:38.120
<v Speaker 3>the dinner and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

3619
02:20:38.121 --> 02:20:39.230
<v Speaker 3>none of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the,</v>

3620
02:20:39.370 --> 02:20:41.600
<v Speaker 3>it's like the worst level of food.</v>

3621
02:20:41.600 --> 02:20:44.440
<v Speaker 3>Like it just like peas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>carrots,</v>

3622
02:20:44.910 --> 02:20:47.300
<v Speaker 3>carrots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like not like there's no salt,</v>

3623
02:20:47.301 --> 02:20:49.250
<v Speaker 3>there's no mess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no taste to it.</v>

3624
02:20:49.430 --> 02:20:50.580
<v Speaker 3>And then like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3625
02:20:50.690 --> 02:20:53.570
<v Speaker 3>an uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hot dog like that with a bunch to the</v>

3626
02:20:53.571 --> 02:20:56.420
<v Speaker 3>hot dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>San Quintin's,</v>

3627
02:20:56.421 --> 02:20:59.240
<v Speaker 3>the prison that every prisoner wants to</v>
<v Speaker 3>graduate to in California.</v>

3628
02:21:00.140 --> 02:21:04.190
<v Speaker 3>And so a lot of the guys end up like</v>
<v Speaker 3>illegally bringing food in and then</v>

3629
02:21:04.191 --> 02:21:07.420
<v Speaker 3>making food together in their cells</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they are like,</v>

3630
02:21:07.430 --> 02:21:08.900
<v Speaker 3>I can't eat this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not,</v>

3631
02:21:08.930 --> 02:21:10.410
<v Speaker 3>this is not good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3632
02:21:10.880 --> 02:21:15.460
<v Speaker 3>And also dinner's at 5:00 so I can you</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you eat at 5:00 and you know,</v>

3633
02:21:15.500 --> 02:21:17.990
<v Speaker 3>nobody's going to bed at six and was</v>
<v Speaker 3>still hungry.</v>

3634
02:21:17.991 --> 02:21:19.010
<v Speaker 3>So you're still late,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

3635
02:21:19.011 --> 02:21:20.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like 10:00 at night,</v>

3636
02:21:20.091 --> 02:21:21.650
<v Speaker 3>you're hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to have figure out a different</v>

3637
02:21:21.651 --> 02:21:24.710
<v Speaker 3>way to make something happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what's also fucked is that you get</v>

3638
02:21:25.280 --> 02:21:27.470
<v Speaker 3>like thirty cents an hour or something</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that for working.</v>

3639
02:21:27.500 --> 02:21:29.190
<v Speaker 3>And you know why that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is because of the,</v>

3640
02:21:29.210 --> 02:21:32.150
<v Speaker 3>the emancipation proclamation didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>apply to prisoners.</v>

3641
02:21:33.380 --> 02:21:34.220
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3642
02:21:34.280 --> 02:21:36.500
<v Speaker 3>So that's why you can pay prisoners</v>
<v Speaker 3>thirty cents an hour.</v>

3643
02:21:38.450 --> 02:21:40.030
<v Speaker 3>Oh beautiful.</v>

3644
02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:44.010
<v Speaker 3>We're going to talk about fun things</v>
<v Speaker 3>would happen.</v>

3645
02:21:44.330 --> 02:21:47.660
<v Speaker 3>It happened to me some fun shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did you do that was fun?</v>

3646
02:21:47.680 --> 02:21:49.310
<v Speaker 3>Like what'd you enjoy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3647
02:21:49.311 --> 02:21:51.210
<v Speaker 3>what did I enjoy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3648
02:21:51.290 --> 02:21:55.000
<v Speaker 3>we did Puerto Rico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Puerto Rico because I just had Peter</v>

3649
02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.230
<v Speaker 3>Schiff on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He moved all his money over to Puerto</v>

3650
02:21:57.230 --> 02:21:58.460
<v Speaker 3>Rico because you don't have to pay</v>
<v Speaker 3>taxes.</v>

3651
02:21:58.670 --> 02:21:59.540
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 40,</v>

3652
02:21:59.690 --> 02:22:01.250
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing of Puerto Rico.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So strange.</v>

3653
02:22:01.251 --> 02:22:03.950
<v Speaker 3>But it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me the fact Puerto Rico's bankrupt,</v>

3654
02:22:03.951 --> 02:22:07.760
<v Speaker 3>it's like $80,000,000,000 or some sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of crazy figure of debt and it's.</v>

3655
02:22:07.950 --> 02:22:10.730
<v Speaker 3>And it's just because the US has used</v>
<v Speaker 3>Puerto Rico,</v>

3656
02:22:11.050 --> 02:22:11.580
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3657
02:22:11.580 --> 02:22:12.800
<v Speaker 3>like as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as like,</v>

3658
02:22:12.801 --> 02:22:14.210
<v Speaker 3>it's like the ATM,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3659
02:22:14.211 --> 02:22:16.550
<v Speaker 3>we sort of did things there and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't because it wasn't a state,</v>

3660
02:22:16.551 --> 02:22:17.720
<v Speaker 3>we didn't have to sort of do it the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

3661
02:22:17.930 --> 02:22:20.240
<v Speaker 3>but it is one of the most beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 3>places I've ever been in my life.</v>

3662
02:22:20.800 --> 02:22:24.350
<v Speaker 3>And I mean I was there like the show</v>
<v Speaker 3>runner,</v>

3663
02:22:24.351 --> 02:22:25.830
<v Speaker 3>Dion Jackson was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd been there before,</v>

3664
02:22:25.831 --> 02:22:29.540
<v Speaker 3>he's like there's houses for $25,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like calling my wife,</v>

3665
02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:31.560
<v Speaker 3>we should just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't own a house in California.</v>

3666
02:22:31.590 --> 02:22:33.450
<v Speaker 3>We should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3667
02:22:33.451 --> 02:22:36.660
<v Speaker 3>like it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's such a fun,</v>

3668
02:22:37.050 --> 02:22:40.440
<v Speaker 3>beautiful place that has been exploited</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the United States of America by not</v>

3669
02:22:40.441 --> 02:22:42.240
<v Speaker 3>being a state and not being independent</v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

3670
02:22:42.610 --> 02:22:46.890
<v Speaker 3>Like it's weird to like stings aren't</v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed to ship directly to Puerto Rico.</v>

3671
02:22:46.891 --> 02:22:49.590
<v Speaker 3>They have to ship to the United States</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then go to Puerto Rico so that</v>

3672
02:22:49.610 --> 02:22:51.540
<v Speaker 3>everything is super expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super expensive.</v>

3673
02:22:51.541 --> 02:22:52.590
<v Speaker 3>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me it's like,</v>

3674
02:22:52.890 --> 02:22:55.440
<v Speaker 3>it's like being in a foreign country but</v>
<v Speaker 3>your cell phone works.</v>

3675
02:22:56.130 --> 02:22:57.720
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you get all the,</v>

3676
02:22:57.721 --> 02:23:02.721
<v Speaker 3>like different culture and new food and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get all the like know the people</v>

3677
02:23:02.881 --> 02:23:05.430
<v Speaker 3>speak Spanish so if you speak a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit of Spanish you can get by.</v>

3678
02:23:05.580 --> 02:23:08.820
<v Speaker 3>It's a super diverse place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like I as a guy who's married to a</v>

3679
02:23:08.821 --> 02:23:10.590
<v Speaker 3>white woman with a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a couple of mixed race kids,</v>

3680
02:23:10.650 --> 02:23:12.480
<v Speaker 3>we don't feel like we stick out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3681
02:23:12.481 --> 02:23:14.550
<v Speaker 3>they're just sort of like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the weather was,</v>

3682
02:23:14.551 --> 02:23:16.220
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

3683
02:23:16.330 --> 02:23:17.820
<v Speaker 3>I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to go back so badly.</v>

3684
02:23:17.990 --> 02:23:21.210
<v Speaker 3>Like loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I loved it and I don't like stuff.</v>

3685
02:23:21.470 --> 02:23:24.510
<v Speaker 3>Do you think you could live there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it could retire there.</v>

3686
02:23:24.511 --> 02:23:26.880
<v Speaker 3>I think it was all said and done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I could be like,</v>

3687
02:23:26.970 --> 02:23:29.880
<v Speaker 3>I think at this point it'd be hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I certainly think if I liked was an</v>

3688
02:23:29.881 --> 02:23:31.440
<v Speaker 3>east coast life maybe because there's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of people,</v>

3689
02:23:31.441 --> 02:23:34.140
<v Speaker 3>a lot of Puerto Ricans who live in New</v>
<v Speaker 3>York who have houses in Puerto Rico.</v>

3690
02:23:34.410 --> 02:23:35.910
<v Speaker 3>But then I also feel weird because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>not Puerto Rican.</v>

3691
02:23:35.911 --> 02:23:36.840
<v Speaker 3>Like am I a gentrifier?</v>

3692
02:23:37.890 --> 02:23:42.240
<v Speaker 3>Am I making it better by this house for</v>
<v Speaker 3>$25,000 that helping you or is that</v>

3693
02:23:42.241 --> 02:23:43.560
<v Speaker 3>actually fucking you over?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

3694
02:23:45.150 --> 02:23:47.850
<v Speaker 3>I bought this $25,000 to be conscious of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that stuff.</v>

3695
02:23:47.920 --> 02:23:49.380
<v Speaker 3>I believe you have to be conscious of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3696
02:23:49.381 --> 02:23:51.150
<v Speaker 3>So I think if I did it I would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I met a.</v>

3697
02:23:51.240 --> 02:23:53.940
<v Speaker 3>I met the governor of Puerto Rico who is</v>
<v Speaker 3>not very popular,</v>

3698
02:23:53.941 --> 02:23:55.680
<v Speaker 3>but I was happy to talk to you a</v>
<v Speaker 3>governor.</v>

3699
02:23:55.681 --> 02:23:58.260
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know the whole battle is over</v>

3700
02:23:58.261 --> 02:24:02.850
<v Speaker 3>statehood in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in to they want it like it's really a</v>

3701
02:24:02.851 --> 02:24:05.490
<v Speaker 3>disputed thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most many activists don't want it</v>

3702
02:24:05.491 --> 02:24:08.100
<v Speaker 3>because they feel like why are we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are we sort of being subjugated by</v>

3703
02:24:08.101 --> 02:24:09.630
<v Speaker 3>the United States?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why can't we were on country?</v>

3704
02:24:09.631 --> 02:24:11.490
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is they're like</v>
<v Speaker 3>$80,000,000,000,000,</v>

3705
02:24:11.520 --> 02:24:13.800
<v Speaker 3>like whatever it is there so much in</v>
<v Speaker 3>debt.</v>

3706
02:24:13.801 --> 02:24:16.340
<v Speaker 3>It's like what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it feels like to me like it's an,</v>

3707
02:24:16.840 --> 02:24:18.660
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

3708
02:24:19.140 --> 02:24:21.060
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Hawaii,</v>

3709
02:24:21.061 --> 02:24:22.590
<v Speaker 3>but it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like Hawaii,</v>

3710
02:24:22.591 --> 02:24:24.930
<v Speaker 3>but it's like if we hit it doesn't make</v>
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

3711
02:24:24.930 --> 02:24:27.450
<v Speaker 3>It's in debt is what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make sense that it feels like</v>

3712
02:24:27.451 --> 02:24:29.200
<v Speaker 3>this is a beautiful place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

3713
02:24:29.201 --> 02:24:31.770
<v Speaker 3>this could be if you just taking</v>
<v Speaker 3>advantage of what it looks like,</v>

3714
02:24:31.771 --> 02:24:33.060
<v Speaker 3>this place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be making a lot of money.</v>

3715
02:24:33.061 --> 02:24:34.770
<v Speaker 3>He just has a resort,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a resort.</v>

3716
02:24:34.771 --> 02:24:37.020
<v Speaker 3>This is a place to like and it done the</v>
<v Speaker 3>right way.</v>

3717
02:24:37.080 --> 02:24:39.240
<v Speaker 3>They should be making money hand over</v>
<v Speaker 3>fist.</v>

3718
02:24:39.820 --> 02:24:42.720
<v Speaker 3>So I started to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I invest in Puerto Rico.</v>

3719
02:24:43.480 --> 02:24:45.330
<v Speaker 3>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I do with my buddy.</v>

3720
02:24:45.331 --> 02:24:48.030
<v Speaker 3>But I really could be an east coast guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>though if you've lived,</v>

3721
02:24:48.031 --> 02:24:49.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this time on the west coast,</v>

3722
02:24:50.040 --> 02:24:52.210
<v Speaker 3>I can be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can do well the Puerto Rico,</v>

3723
02:24:52.290 --> 02:24:55.380
<v Speaker 3>Puerto Rico's not the east coast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's different than if you'd have to</v>

3724
02:24:55.381 --> 02:24:58.230
<v Speaker 3>either live there all about what time</v>
<v Speaker 3>all told I,</v>

3725
02:24:58.290 --> 02:25:00.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about that version of me</v>

3726
02:25:00.271 --> 02:25:01.820
<v Speaker 3>that ends up with like some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3727
02:25:02.280 --> 02:25:05.070
<v Speaker 3>that somehow ends up with Kevin Hart</v>
<v Speaker 3>money without working as hard as Kevin</v>

3728
02:25:05.070 --> 02:25:07.650
<v Speaker 3>Hart or somehow something happens where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>

3729
02:25:07.890 --> 02:25:10.100
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's weird that I invested in that,</v>

3730
02:25:10.101 --> 02:25:10.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3731
02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:12.000
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shoelace company.</v>

3732
02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.010
<v Speaker 3>And now those shoelaces are everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3733
02:25:14.100 --> 02:25:15.620
<v Speaker 3>then it would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna,</v>

3734
02:25:15.640 --> 02:25:17.460
<v Speaker 3>go to Puerto Rico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go to Puerto Rico.</v>

3735
02:25:17.461 --> 02:25:20.220
<v Speaker 3>I would certainly spend some time there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you go to Puerto Rico though and</v>

3736
02:25:20.221 --> 02:25:22.200
<v Speaker 3>you move all your business to Puerto</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rico,</v>

3737
02:25:22.201 --> 02:25:23.530
<v Speaker 3>you moved your money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Puerto Rico,</v>

3738
02:25:23.531 --> 02:25:26.230
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to pay taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe me,</v>

3739
02:25:26.231 --> 02:25:27.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm with real weird.</v>

3740
02:25:27.821 --> 02:25:29.170
<v Speaker 3>It's my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would not be.</v>

3741
02:25:29.230 --> 02:25:32.230
<v Speaker 3>She's the West coaster and she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she would not be done for that.</v>

3742
02:25:32.231 --> 02:25:34.810
<v Speaker 3>But I do think about going back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was hoping we could screen in episode</v>

3743
02:25:34.811 --> 02:25:36.370
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Puerto Rico episode there cause it</v>

3744
02:25:36.371 --> 02:25:39.370
<v Speaker 3>was a lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But seeing how many episodes have you</v>

3745
02:25:39.371 --> 02:25:40.750
<v Speaker 3>done so far?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've done 16.</v>

3746
02:25:40.751 --> 02:25:42.220
<v Speaker 3>It's a to season.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3747
02:25:42.221 --> 02:25:44.380
<v Speaker 3>And so we're about to start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We start filming season two,</v>

3748
02:25:44.930 --> 02:25:47.860
<v Speaker 3>like September third.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pumped.</v>

3749
02:25:48.030 --> 02:25:48.581
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3750
02:25:48.581 --> 02:25:49.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm excited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's been,</v>

3751
02:25:50.020 --> 02:25:52.960
<v Speaker 3>it's weird because last season when the</v>
<v Speaker 3>show went off the air I felt like I</v>

3752
02:25:52.961 --> 02:25:54.220
<v Speaker 3>could tell that like people didn't.</v>

3753
02:25:54.310 --> 02:25:56.290
<v Speaker 3>They sort of talk about the show had</v>
<v Speaker 3>gone away.</v>

3754
02:25:56.710 --> 02:25:59.140
<v Speaker 3>But the trump era is good for business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How?</v>

3755
02:25:59.170 --> 02:26:02.140
<v Speaker 3>How so what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you felt that the talk had gone</v>

3756
02:26:02.141 --> 02:26:02.831
<v Speaker 3>away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>

3757
02:26:02.831 --> 02:26:03.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3758
02:26:03.400 --> 02:26:05.440
<v Speaker 3>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're like when you fear special</v>

3759
02:26:05.441 --> 02:26:06.520
<v Speaker 3>comes out and you're walking around</v>
<v Speaker 3>town,</v>

3760
02:26:06.521 --> 02:26:11.070
<v Speaker 3>more people may recognize you more</v>
<v Speaker 3>people and then when you're specials not</v>

3761
02:26:11.080 --> 02:26:12.010
<v Speaker 3>out it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3762
02:26:12.011 --> 02:26:14.980
<v Speaker 3>sometimes the volume gets turned down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But with this I still walk around and</v>

3763
02:26:14.981 --> 02:26:17.410
<v Speaker 3>it's like the show is still on the air,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are still talking about the show</v>

3764
02:26:17.411 --> 02:26:18.700
<v Speaker 3>and they see me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a sense of like,</v>

3765
02:26:19.130 --> 02:26:21.220
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they really feel the show in a very</v>

3766
02:26:21.221 --> 02:26:23.230
<v Speaker 3>deep way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I hear from people like families</v>

3767
02:26:23.231 --> 02:26:24.880
<v Speaker 3>watch the show together and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3768
02:26:24.881 --> 02:26:26.800
<v Speaker 3>and I didn't make it for that reason so</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3769
02:26:27.040 --> 02:26:30.760
<v Speaker 3>so it feels like the show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first season show Obama was still in</v>

3770
02:26:30.761 --> 02:26:31.594
<v Speaker 3>office.</v>

3771
02:26:31.660 --> 02:26:34.230
<v Speaker 3>So I felt like that was like the mixed</v>
<v Speaker 3>tape and the first season was like the,</v>

3772
02:26:34.430 --> 02:26:36.020
<v Speaker 3>the second seems like the album and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3773
02:26:36.050 --> 02:26:38.650
<v Speaker 3>I feel like now like people are looking</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the show in a different way.</v>

3774
02:26:38.651 --> 02:26:42.400
<v Speaker 3>So it feels like knowing that I have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make sure the show steps it up a notch.</v>

3775
02:26:42.430 --> 02:26:43.410
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the,</v>

3776
02:26:43.650 --> 02:26:45.760
<v Speaker 3>I feel the pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like make sure that we don't just,</v>

3777
02:26:45.900 --> 02:26:48.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to make the show like which</v>

3778
02:26:48.371 --> 02:26:50.080
<v Speaker 3>white supremacist he going to talk to</v>
<v Speaker 3>you this season,</v>

3779
02:26:50.081 --> 02:26:52.000
<v Speaker 3>but we have to do other things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can't just be,</v>

3780
02:26:52.030 --> 02:26:53.350
<v Speaker 3>we can't be repeating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

3781
02:26:53.351 --> 02:26:55.150
<v Speaker 3>So you feel like a sense of</v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility,</v>

3782
02:26:55.151 --> 02:26:58.870
<v Speaker 3>not just to entertain but also to Kinda</v>
<v Speaker 3>like get some ideas out there that maybe</v>

3783
02:26:58.871 --> 02:27:03.430
<v Speaker 3>would reach people and maybe I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like we're as comedians were all</v>

3784
02:27:03.550 --> 02:27:05.710
<v Speaker 3>responsible to our material,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

3785
02:27:05.890 --> 02:27:09.730
<v Speaker 3>And so I feel like in that sense I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing anything different than Jim</v>

3786
02:27:09.730 --> 02:27:10.451
<v Speaker 3>Gaffigan's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

3787
02:27:10.451 --> 02:27:12.070
<v Speaker 3>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are the things I want to talk</v>

3788
02:27:12.071 --> 02:27:13.470
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are the things you want to go,</v>

3789
02:27:13.471 --> 02:27:14.890
<v Speaker 3>things I want to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not Jim,</v>

3790
02:27:15.110 --> 02:27:16.560
<v Speaker 3>not Jim Gaffigan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3791
02:27:16.610 --> 02:27:18.140
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I feel like I don't want to.</v>

3792
02:27:18.510 --> 02:27:22.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to separate myself from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's easy to somehow I believe in the</v>

3793
02:27:22.571 --> 02:27:24.580
<v Speaker 3>work that I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm excited about the work I'm doing.</v>

3794
02:27:24.790 --> 02:27:27.970
<v Speaker 3>I do think that the work can help</v>
<v Speaker 3>lubricate changes.</v>

3795
02:27:27.971 --> 02:27:29.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the change,</v>

3796
02:27:29.410 --> 02:27:33.460
<v Speaker 3>but I don't want to get caught up in</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the sort of like this is important.</v>

3797
02:27:33.520 --> 02:27:35.830
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I just feel like at the end of</v>

3798
02:27:35.830 --> 02:27:36.950
<v Speaker 3>the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people often say to me like,</v>

3799
02:27:37.110 --> 02:27:38.560
<v Speaker 3>do you still consider yourself a</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedian?</v>

3800
02:27:38.650 --> 02:27:39.610
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a comedian.</v>

3801
02:27:39.610 --> 02:27:40.840
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still do stand up.</v>

3802
02:27:41.140 --> 02:27:43.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to work on my next special,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm still trying to do these</v>

3803
02:27:43.571 --> 02:27:45.490
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fun to be.</v>

3804
02:27:45.550 --> 02:27:48.550
<v Speaker 3>It's fun to say funny things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just like to say funny things about</v>

3805
02:27:48.551 --> 02:27:49.920
<v Speaker 3>these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3806
02:27:49.940 --> 02:27:53.560
<v Speaker 3>Well you also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a part of this giant discussion</v>

3807
02:27:53.561 --> 02:27:56.350
<v Speaker 3>whether you're a comedian or an author</v>
<v Speaker 3>or journalist,</v>

3808
02:27:56.560 --> 02:28:00.280
<v Speaker 3>you're a part of this giant discussion</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is human culture and I think we</v>

3809
02:28:00.281 --> 02:28:04.570
<v Speaker 3>need people that are articulate and</v>
<v Speaker 3>thoughtful on all sides.</v>

3810
02:28:04.840 --> 02:28:09.000
<v Speaker 3>We need to like figure out that there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be all styles of humans to</v>

3811
02:28:09.001 --> 02:28:11.020
<v Speaker 3>different things that people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in,</v>

3812
02:28:11.021 --> 02:28:15.400
<v Speaker 3>but what's got to be the most important</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing about being an American is</v>

3813
02:28:15.401 --> 02:28:18.760
<v Speaker 3>respecting all the other styles of</v>
<v Speaker 3>human.</v>

3814
02:28:18.820 --> 02:28:22.520
<v Speaker 3>All the other ways people think whether</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're conservative</v>

3815
02:28:22.520 --> 02:28:24.860
<v Speaker 2>or whether they're liberal or whether</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

3816
02:28:25.070 --> 02:28:27.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether they choose to whatever the fuck</v>

3817
02:28:27.771 --> 02:28:30.290
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to live off the land in Alaska</v>

3818
02:28:30.291 --> 02:28:32.450
<v Speaker 2>or whether you want to be in Manhattan.</v>

3819
02:28:33.060 --> 02:28:33.930
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3820
02:28:33.931 --> 02:28:35.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether you want to be in Alabama where</v>

3821
02:28:35.401 --> 02:28:38.100
<v Speaker 3>they want to be in Berkeley and I go to</v>
<v Speaker 3>both those places so I see all those</v>

3822
02:28:38.101 --> 02:28:40.230
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think the thing is is like you and</v>

3823
02:28:40.231 --> 02:28:43.740
<v Speaker 3>you have to realize that this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>something is maybe makes you nervous or</v>

3824
02:28:43.741 --> 02:28:45.210
<v Speaker 3>scared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not always about you.</v>

3825
02:28:45.300 --> 02:28:47.730
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's the big thing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>people get wrong about the bay area.</v>

3826
02:28:47.760 --> 02:28:49.680
<v Speaker 3>We're not all a bunch of liberal people</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the same page.</v>

3827
02:28:49.920 --> 02:28:52.080
<v Speaker 3>We just recognize that we all go out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there because it's like I just wanna go</v>

3828
02:28:52.090 --> 02:28:55.080
<v Speaker 3>someplace where I can do my own thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just go meet some rich people in Marin</v>

3829
02:28:55.080 --> 02:28:56.310
<v Speaker 3>county if you think that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>

3830
02:28:56.311 --> 02:28:56.730
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3831
02:28:56.730 --> 02:29:00.840
<v Speaker 3>Or silicon valley is silicon valley or</v>
<v Speaker 3>those silicon valley people.</v>

3832
02:29:00.841 --> 02:29:03.420
<v Speaker 3>So weird though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they try so hard to go left</v>

3833
02:29:03.810 --> 02:29:05.490
<v Speaker 3>because it's almost like they feel like</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to.</v>

3834
02:29:05.491 --> 02:29:07.090
<v Speaker 3>It's like a part of the business model.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3835
02:29:07.100 --> 02:29:08.220
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of those people.</v>

3836
02:29:08.310 --> 02:29:09.810
<v Speaker 3>It's like when you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

3837
02:29:09.811 --> 02:29:14.811
<v Speaker 3>did you really invent anything?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't like instagram wasn't that</v>

3838
02:29:15.031 --> 02:29:16.710
<v Speaker 3>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just pictures like you know,</v>

3839
02:29:16.711 --> 02:29:17.460
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>

3840
02:29:17.460 --> 02:29:20.090
<v Speaker 3>So I feel like there's probably a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>silicon valley guilt in there too.</v>

3841
02:29:20.140 --> 02:29:22.740
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like the amount of money.</v>

3842
02:29:22.890 --> 02:29:26.370
<v Speaker 3>I said I'm just going to do the part</v>
<v Speaker 3>about facebook this picture now I have a</v>

3843
02:29:26.370 --> 02:29:28.170
<v Speaker 3>billion dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't do the thinking and Zuckerberg</v>

3844
02:29:28.171 --> 02:29:29.190
<v Speaker 3>is going to run for president.</v>

3845
02:29:32.850 --> 02:29:35.370
<v Speaker 3>Trump has changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's turned the table over.</v>

3846
02:29:35.460 --> 02:29:37.050
<v Speaker 3>He.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think in that sense.</v>

3847
02:29:37.230 --> 02:29:38.760
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see what happens.</v>

3848
02:29:38.761 --> 02:29:42.310
<v Speaker 3>I think we definitely need new ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not keeping for Duncan Berg,</v>

3849
02:29:42.350 --> 02:29:42.921
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3850
02:29:42.921 --> 02:29:43.740
<v Speaker 3>he could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah.</v>

3851
02:29:43.740 --> 02:29:44.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3852
02:29:44.830 --> 02:29:47.470
<v Speaker 3>The world is better now than it was in</v>
<v Speaker 3>$1,900,</v>

3853
02:29:47.520 --> 02:29:52.520
<v Speaker 2>but it's a slow sort of gradual</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution of human ideas,</v>

3854
02:29:53.670 --> 02:29:55.800
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that shows like yours</v>

3855
02:29:55.801 --> 02:29:58.560
<v Speaker 2>contribute to that and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations contribute to that and</v>

3856
02:29:58.561 --> 02:30:00.030
<v Speaker 2>getting just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3857
02:30:00.090 --> 02:30:03.600
<v Speaker 2>this thing is like one layer of paint at</v>
<v Speaker 2>a time.</v>

3858
02:30:03.601 --> 02:30:05.230
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to build a mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3859
02:30:05.470 --> 02:30:07.380
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's frustrating for people because they</v>

3860
02:30:07.381 --> 02:30:08.640
<v Speaker 2>want immediate change.</v>

3861
02:30:08.830 --> 02:30:10.840
<v Speaker 3>And I think the thing is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take that analogy,</v>

3862
02:30:10.841 --> 02:30:11.560
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3863
02:30:11.560 --> 02:30:12.980
<v Speaker 3>that was the wrong color of paint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got to</v>

3864
02:30:14.510 --> 02:30:16.390
<v Speaker 3>get some errors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>errors.</v>

3865
02:30:16.391 --> 02:30:20.410
<v Speaker 3>And I think that right now I believe</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going through an error and the</v>

3866
02:30:20.411 --> 02:30:21.540
<v Speaker 3>error era.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

3867
02:30:21.640 --> 02:30:22.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't know though,</v>

3868
02:30:22.430 --> 02:30:26.840
<v Speaker 2>since I think like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the response to it has genuinely</v>

3869
02:30:26.960 --> 02:30:30.350
<v Speaker 2>energized people to look at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>surroundings,</v>

3870
02:30:30.560 --> 02:30:34.430
<v Speaker 2>look at politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the way we're governing this</v>

3871
02:30:34.520 --> 02:30:37.130
<v Speaker 2>civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that we're interacting with each</v>

3872
02:30:37.131 --> 02:30:40.130
<v Speaker 2>other and try,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the people that are responding to</v>

3873
02:30:40.131 --> 02:30:43.250
<v Speaker 2>these people walking down the street</v>
<v Speaker 2>with fucking home depot candles and</v>

3874
02:30:43.251 --> 02:30:48.020
<v Speaker 2>screaming out antisemitic slurs or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck they're doing that has</v>

3875
02:30:48.110 --> 02:30:51.800
<v Speaker 2>sort of energized people in that don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>agree with that.</v>

3876
02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:55.820
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of like step up and try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand how the fuck is this still</v>

3877
02:30:55.821 --> 02:30:59.180
<v Speaker 2>going on in 2017.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like who are these people that we didn't</v>

3878
02:30:59.181 --> 02:31:01.550
<v Speaker 2>know existed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you live in Santa Monica,</v>

3879
02:31:01.750 --> 02:31:03.710
<v Speaker 2>know that you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not around any of that.</v>

3880
02:31:03.711 --> 02:31:06.500
<v Speaker 2>Everybody you know is pretty left wing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

3881
02:31:06.750 --> 02:31:08.000
<v Speaker 2>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are these people?</v>

3882
02:31:08.001 --> 02:31:08.930
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

3883
02:31:08.960 --> 02:31:13.960
<v Speaker 2>what part of us is represented in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>ugly aspect of our culture?</v>

3884
02:31:14.301 --> 02:31:15.770
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3885
02:31:16.580 --> 02:31:20.160
<v Speaker 2>people that hate white people or people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that hate black or people that hate</v>

3886
02:31:20.160 --> 02:31:23.010
<v Speaker 3>Jews or what is this like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is this still here?</v>

3887
02:31:23.400 --> 02:31:26.790
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what has failed that this still exists.</v>

3888
02:31:26.791 --> 02:31:29.940
<v Speaker 3>And I think these conversations are a</v>
<v Speaker 3>big part mean.</v>

3889
02:31:30.090 --> 02:31:32.410
<v Speaker 3>What you're doing by doing your show is</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

3890
02:31:32.670 --> 02:31:37.670
<v Speaker 3>for millions of people that get to tune</v>
<v Speaker 3>in and they get to hear the words and it</v>

3891
02:31:38.521 --> 02:31:41.580
<v Speaker 3>adds layers to the way they understand</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings.</v>

3892
02:31:41.610 --> 02:31:43.230
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so God damn important.</v>

3893
02:31:43.470 --> 02:31:46.800
<v Speaker 3>And for me it's like I appreciate you</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying that and for me there's a part of</v>

3894
02:31:46.801 --> 02:31:49.590
<v Speaker 3>this that is wholly just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to have these conversations.</v>

3895
02:31:49.950 --> 02:31:53.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy to see it in his budget to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make these conversations happen.</v>

3896
02:31:53.190 --> 02:31:55.560
<v Speaker 3>I've always wanted to sit down with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>engineer.</v>

3897
02:31:55.561 --> 02:31:55.951
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3898
02:31:55.951 --> 02:31:58.860
<v Speaker 3>That's the engine that it forward</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually do want to have these</v>

3899
02:31:58.861 --> 02:32:02.340
<v Speaker 3>conversations and that's one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that makes them just a authentic</v>

3900
02:32:02.341 --> 02:32:03.540
<v Speaker 3>to people that are watching the show.</v>

3901
02:32:03.570 --> 02:32:06.660
<v Speaker 3>I can tell when I watch your show like</v>
<v Speaker 3>this has come out,</v>

3902
02:32:06.690 --> 02:32:08.430
<v Speaker 3>like really being interested in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3903
02:32:08.500 --> 02:32:11.160
<v Speaker 3>No I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when I'm not interested we don't use</v>

3904
02:32:11.161 --> 02:32:11.551
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3905
02:32:11.551 --> 02:32:12.840
<v Speaker 3>like are we too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are we really.</v>

3906
02:32:12.990 --> 02:32:15.060
<v Speaker 3>We really work hard to pick the right</v>
<v Speaker 3>people and you know,</v>

3907
02:32:15.061 --> 02:32:18.330
<v Speaker 3>there's debates like we had a whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>debate like what if we could get trump,</v>

3908
02:32:18.810 --> 02:32:19.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what'd you do?</v>

3909
02:32:20.210 --> 02:32:21.750
<v Speaker 3>I that I had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really pushed back.</v>

3910
02:32:21.751 --> 02:32:23.240
<v Speaker 3>I was like in there still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3911
02:32:23.340 --> 02:32:25.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe because I believe he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>uncurious.</v>

3912
02:32:25.950 --> 02:32:27.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe there's any there there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you,</v>

3913
02:32:28.050 --> 02:32:30.510
<v Speaker 3>would you ask him if he's on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather,</v>

3914
02:32:30.540 --> 02:32:32.760
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think he would even take in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the question that I was at,</v>

3915
02:32:32.761 --> 02:32:34.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather Ivanka.</v>

3916
02:32:34.471 --> 02:32:36.510
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather like somebody who's actually</v>

3917
02:32:36.511 --> 02:32:38.210
<v Speaker 3>who I feel like it's like you can see</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's like,</v>

3918
02:32:38.240 --> 02:32:40.230
<v Speaker 3>this is not going according to plan.</v>

3919
02:32:40.230 --> 02:32:41.940
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grew up with the Internet.</v>

3920
02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:42.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3921
02:32:42.600 --> 02:32:43.710
<v Speaker 3>That would rather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would rather,</v>

3922
02:32:43.980 --> 02:32:44.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3923
02:32:44.700 --> 02:32:47.040
<v Speaker 3>I probably rather bannon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

3924
02:32:47.041 --> 02:32:49.230
<v Speaker 3>Like I feel like I don't believe that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's any,</v>

3925
02:32:49.231 --> 02:32:50.730
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were things would smell like</v>

3926
02:32:50.731 --> 02:32:55.731
<v Speaker 3>sulfur.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've forgotten someone light a match.</v>

3927
02:32:56.100 --> 02:32:58.590
<v Speaker 3>I feel like he's going to probably carry</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cell phone in his pocket.</v>

3928
02:32:58.630 --> 02:33:03.120
<v Speaker 3>So he does smell like sulfur because he</v>
<v Speaker 3>wants to create the illusion that I am</v>

3929
02:33:03.510 --> 02:33:06.260
<v Speaker 3>the reckoning am all times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3930
02:33:06.270 --> 02:33:07.850
<v Speaker 3>That's like the Bhagavad Gita.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3931
02:33:07.860 --> 02:33:10.800
<v Speaker 3>Become death world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I think he probably,</v>

3932
02:33:11.070 --> 02:33:12.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why I hate it when starting live</v>

3933
02:33:12.660 --> 02:33:14.940
<v Speaker 3>made him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the parody of him was like the grim</v>

3934
02:33:14.941 --> 02:33:15.870
<v Speaker 3>reaper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

3935
02:33:15.890 --> 02:33:16.723
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3936
02:33:17.870 --> 02:33:18.900
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3937
02:33:18.940 --> 02:33:20.280
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I am.</v>

3938
02:33:20.281 --> 02:33:21.230
<v Speaker 3>I am the grim reaper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3939
02:33:21.360 --> 02:33:24.960
<v Speaker 3>The Sean Spicer one was hilarious</v>
<v Speaker 3>because trump thought that Melissa</v>

3940
02:33:24.960 --> 02:33:27.830
<v Speaker 3>mccarthy doing it made him look like</v>
<v Speaker 3>woman who was doing.</v>

3941
02:33:28.620 --> 02:33:31.170
<v Speaker 3>There was a push at one point that Rosie</v>
<v Speaker 3>O'donnell do trump and I was like,</v>

3942
02:33:31.171 --> 02:33:35.140
<v Speaker 3>that would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would have been after she was done to</v>

3943
02:33:35.150 --> 02:33:36.990
<v Speaker 3>do what she talked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so good at it.</v>

3944
02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.810
<v Speaker 3>That's great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think about like Bob's great,</v>

3945
02:33:39.811 --> 02:33:41.820
<v Speaker 3>but I would have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rosie would've really hurt his feelings</v>

3946
02:33:41.821 --> 02:33:42.960
<v Speaker 3>and he probably would've.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3947
02:33:43.050 --> 02:33:44.820
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She can say some dark,</v>

3948
02:33:44.821 --> 02:33:49.050
<v Speaker 3>dark shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the fact that spicer retired too.</v>

3949
02:33:49.051 --> 02:33:50.850
<v Speaker 3>When scaramucci got on board,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3950
02:33:50.851 --> 02:33:51.720
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3951
02:33:51.750 --> 02:33:53.160
<v Speaker 3>but then now they're scared when she's</v>
<v Speaker 3>gone.</v>

3952
02:33:53.161 --> 02:33:54.780
<v Speaker 3>Spicer hasn't been like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can I have my job back?</v>

3953
02:33:54.781 --> 02:33:57.850
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would.</v>

3954
02:33:58.020 --> 02:33:59.730
<v Speaker 3>He has nobody's hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spicer go,</v>

3955
02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.220
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad that I can finally returned to</v>

3956
02:34:02.221 --> 02:34:04.620
<v Speaker 3>my place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She mentioned being the guy that has to</v>

3957
02:34:04.621 --> 02:34:06.530
<v Speaker 3>tell everybody that this was the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 3>crowd,</v>

3958
02:34:06.540 --> 02:34:10.780
<v Speaker 3>the White House for the first day and</v>
<v Speaker 3>soda.</v>

3959
02:34:11.330 --> 02:34:13.880
<v Speaker 3>You know that there's photos and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

3960
02:34:14.040 --> 02:34:16.530
<v Speaker 3>The first thing you want me to tell</v>
<v Speaker 3>people is a lie and you could see the</v>

3961
02:34:16.531 --> 02:34:20.020
<v Speaker 3>look in phases like this is a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

3962
02:34:20.021 --> 02:34:22.340
<v Speaker 3>I really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a soft spot in my heart for,</v>

3963
02:34:22.570 --> 02:34:23.800
<v Speaker 3>for Sarah Huckabee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sanders,</v>

3964
02:34:23.801 --> 02:34:28.110
<v Speaker 3>because she like goes out there like</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 right now.</v>

3965
02:34:28.250 --> 02:34:30.920
<v Speaker 3>She thinks she's younger than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

3966
02:34:30.970 --> 02:34:32.080
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she's.</v>

3967
02:34:32.170 --> 02:34:33.500
<v Speaker 3>I think she's starting to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3968
02:34:33.580 --> 02:34:35.710
<v Speaker 3>I think she's in her mid thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so,</v>

3969
02:34:35.800 --> 02:34:38.890
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I thought she was just 28 with hard</v>

3970
02:34:38.891 --> 02:34:40.480
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just feel like I liked the fact that</v>

3971
02:34:40.481 --> 02:34:42.880
<v Speaker 3>she's out there like the 25,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30,</v>

3972
02:34:43.090 --> 02:34:43.930
<v Speaker 3>35,</v>
<v Speaker 3>35.</v>

3973
02:34:43.931 --> 02:34:45.160
<v Speaker 3>I liked the fact that she's out there</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3974
02:34:45.630 --> 02:34:46.990
<v Speaker 3>like you kind of know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She knows it's.</v>

3975
02:34:47.220 --> 02:34:48.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm not blinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes.</v>

3976
02:34:49.210 --> 02:34:53.710
<v Speaker 3>She said when I bought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when a brother a trump was a attacking</v>

3977
02:34:53.711 --> 02:34:55.030
<v Speaker 3>people on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was like,</v>

3978
02:34:55.031 --> 02:34:57.550
<v Speaker 3>if you attack him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he hits back 10 times harder.</v>

3979
02:34:57.551 --> 02:34:58.384
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

3980
02:34:58.840 --> 02:34:59.673
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

3981
02:35:01.250 --> 02:35:04.410
<v Speaker 3>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't teach your children that are</v>

3982
02:35:04.420 --> 02:35:07.120
<v Speaker 3>not yet a boxer that's really good at</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking punches.</v>

3983
02:35:07.180 --> 02:35:10.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the president of the united,</v>

3984
02:35:10.211 --> 02:35:11.590
<v Speaker 3>so whatever happened to turn the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>cheek,</v>

3985
02:35:11.600 --> 02:35:13.450
<v Speaker 3>but there was a thing called</v>
<v Speaker 3>presidential,</v>

3986
02:35:13.720 --> 02:35:17.140
<v Speaker 3>but we thought that defined the person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now what we're learning is that the</v>

3987
02:35:17.141 --> 02:35:21.230
<v Speaker 3>person defines the word he's defining</v>
<v Speaker 3>what presidential is,</v>

3988
02:35:22.040 --> 02:35:23.710
<v Speaker 3>his supportive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe if he did it,</v>

3989
02:35:23.770 --> 02:35:26.050
<v Speaker 3>and this is what trump leads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can tell if I say it,</v>

3990
02:35:26.080 --> 02:35:28.060
<v Speaker 3>it's presidential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I say it,</v>

3991
02:35:28.061 --> 02:35:29.630
<v Speaker 3>then it's worthy of the president's</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying it.</v>

3992
02:35:29.740 --> 02:35:31.750
<v Speaker 3>So if me retweeting as he did the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>

3993
02:35:32.020 --> 02:35:32.820
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3994
02:35:32.820 --> 02:35:34.030
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

3995
02:35:34.070 --> 02:35:36.670
<v Speaker 3>with some sort of conspiracy theory</v>
<v Speaker 3>nonsense,</v>

3996
02:35:36.720 --> 02:35:38.680
<v Speaker 3>they don't means it's a legitimate</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

3997
02:35:38.740 --> 02:35:40.840
<v Speaker 3>It has to be the president did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the,</v>

3998
02:35:41.190 --> 02:35:43.150
<v Speaker 3>it's like the same thing with like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>monarchy in England.</v>

3999
02:35:43.150 --> 02:35:45.040
<v Speaker 3>Like if the Queen says it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that's what it is.</v>

4000
02:35:45.070 --> 02:35:47.140
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is where we're at.</v>

4001
02:35:47.740 --> 02:35:52.740
<v Speaker 3>It's a fascinating play if it didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have so much of an impact on our actual</v>

4002
02:35:53.201 --> 02:35:54.370
<v Speaker 3>wellbeing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4003
02:35:54.400 --> 02:35:56.260
<v Speaker 3>Know people told me about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to a woman yesterday who</v>

4004
02:35:56.261 --> 02:35:59.170
<v Speaker 3>was a public school teacher and she was</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying or had been in public school</v>

4005
02:35:59.171 --> 02:36:00.550
<v Speaker 3>teacher and she's talking to other</v>
<v Speaker 3>folks,</v>

4006
02:36:00.551 --> 02:36:03.730
<v Speaker 3>will teachers about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are kids who go to school every</v>

4007
02:36:03.730 --> 02:36:05.680
<v Speaker 3>day who are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are born in this country,</v>

4008
02:36:06.100 --> 02:36:08.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they may be there from the Latino kids</v>

4009
02:36:08.501 --> 02:36:10.240
<v Speaker 3>were born in the country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their parents were,</v>

4010
02:36:10.280 --> 02:36:14.040
<v Speaker 3>are undocumented and they go to school</v>
<v Speaker 3>every day for their parents are going to</v>

4011
02:36:14.050 --> 02:36:17.530
<v Speaker 3>be kicked out of the country and not</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowing what that does to them.</v>

4012
02:36:17.740 --> 02:36:19.840
<v Speaker 3>And now somebody is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why didn't you do your homework?</v>

4013
02:36:21.010 --> 02:36:21.610
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

4014
02:36:21.610 --> 02:36:23.920
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I have a lot going on right now,</v>

4015
02:36:23.940 --> 02:36:26.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why aren't you selling?</v>

02:36:26.520 --> 02:36:27.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got an attitude problem,</v>

4017
02:36:27.671 --> 02:36:31.120
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we're not sort of the trump doing</v>

4018
02:36:31.121 --> 02:36:34.180
<v Speaker 3>all that up their filters down to some</v>
<v Speaker 3>kid in a public school classroom who</v>

4019
02:36:34.181 --> 02:36:36.010
<v Speaker 3>gets in a fight and then they expelled</v>
<v Speaker 3>him because he's like,</v>

4020
02:36:36.011 --> 02:36:39.310
<v Speaker 3>he's got an attitude problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that it's like people are not</v>

4021
02:36:39.311 --> 02:36:41.170
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't think enough about how this</v>

4022
02:36:41.171 --> 02:36:43.930
<v Speaker 3>is affecting regular ass people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4023
02:36:43.931 --> 02:36:46.480
<v Speaker 3>he's a role model.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Believe it or not because he's the</v>

4024
02:36:46.481 --> 02:36:48.820
<v Speaker 3>president and the president by</v>
<v Speaker 3>definition is aroma for sure.</v>

4025
02:36:48.821 --> 02:36:49.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you were a kid,</v>

4026
02:36:50.530 --> 02:36:53.560
<v Speaker 3>when I was in grade school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember kids saying,</v>

4027
02:36:53.561 --> 02:36:55.630
<v Speaker 3>I want to be president some day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and other kids going,</v>

4028
02:36:55.631 --> 02:36:56.950
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this motherfucker's reaching for the</v>

4029
02:36:56.951 --> 02:37:00.010
<v Speaker 3>stars in a while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wants to be the guy.</v>

4030
02:37:00.450 --> 02:37:01.330
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

4031
02:37:01.400 --> 02:37:03.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how difficult would that be?</v>

4032
02:37:03.430 --> 02:37:03.881
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4033
02:37:03.881 --> 02:37:04.980
<v Speaker 3>but then again I grew up with.</v>

4034
02:37:05.020 --> 02:37:08.260
<v Speaker 3>I remember like a grown up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember when Reagan was in office and</v>

4035
02:37:08.261 --> 02:37:10.620
<v Speaker 3>I remember all my family be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

4036
02:37:10.630 --> 02:37:11.500
<v Speaker 3>So funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

4037
02:37:11.580 --> 02:37:13.140
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not everybody.</v>

4038
02:37:13.270 --> 02:37:15.350
<v Speaker 3>Not Everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people that were like that when</v>

4039
02:37:15.351 --> 02:37:17.120
<v Speaker 3>Reagan was in office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is so weird,</v>

4040
02:37:17.121 --> 02:37:22.121
<v Speaker 3>like the whole revisionist history thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that happened like after he was dead.</v>

4041
02:37:22.850 --> 02:37:23.421
<v Speaker 3>Now he's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4042
02:37:23.421 --> 02:37:24.240
<v Speaker 3>he's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the,</v>

4043
02:37:24.240 --> 02:37:25.970
<v Speaker 3>the modern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great president.</v>

4044
02:37:26.330 --> 02:37:29.300
<v Speaker 3>Do you guys remember the whole Ollie</v>
<v Speaker 3>North thing?</v>

4045
02:37:29.510 --> 02:37:33.170
<v Speaker 3>Do you guys remember Iran Contra?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember the guy standing in</v>

4046
02:37:33.171 --> 02:37:37.340
<v Speaker 3>front of the front of the court when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were questioning him saying he</v>

4047
02:37:37.341 --> 02:37:41.180
<v Speaker 3>doesn't remember selling arms to Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

4048
02:37:41.290 --> 02:37:44.150
<v Speaker 3>remember Nancy Reagan standing him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeding him to the next thing to say.</v>

4049
02:37:44.900 --> 02:37:45.351
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4050
02:37:45.351 --> 02:37:48.380
<v Speaker 3>I think that the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to me it's like I just in my lifetime</v>

4051
02:37:48.381 --> 02:37:49.790
<v Speaker 3>it's like people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

4052
02:37:49.800 --> 02:37:50.030
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4053
02:37:50.030 --> 02:37:53.240
<v Speaker 3>Like people I know ran Reagan was such a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad precedent and then you get ga wish.</v>

4054
02:37:53.270 --> 02:37:54.560
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a bad president.</v>

4055
02:37:54.561 --> 02:37:55.700
<v Speaker 3>And he gets through because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4056
02:37:55.701 --> 02:37:56.870
<v Speaker 3>what's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4057
02:37:56.930 --> 02:37:57.763
<v Speaker 3>that's my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4058
02:37:58.150 --> 02:38:00.940
<v Speaker 3>this time doesn't end with trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

4059
02:38:00.941 --> 02:38:02.000
<v Speaker 3>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's see what's coming in.</v>

4060
02:38:02.060 --> 02:38:04.820
<v Speaker 3>And that's why I think when you say like</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing how people react to trump and</v>

4061
02:38:04.821 --> 02:38:07.980
<v Speaker 3>stand up and in the streets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me it's like today they're doing that</v>

4062
02:38:07.981 --> 02:38:10.520
<v Speaker 3>or they did it this weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like some point people either</v>

4063
02:38:10.700 --> 02:38:13.700
<v Speaker 3>they get exhausted by doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a march right now going from</v>

4064
02:38:13.701 --> 02:38:17.600
<v Speaker 3>Charlottesville to DC to protest you</v>
<v Speaker 3>trumps all the things that trump said in</v>

4065
02:38:17.601 --> 02:38:19.540
<v Speaker 3>the wake of walk the whole way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4066
02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:21.650
<v Speaker 3>Was a bunch of people on the way or pick</v>
<v Speaker 3>up some.</v>

4067
02:38:21.651 --> 02:38:24.980
<v Speaker 3>I think that's more likely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like people like that several days.</v>

4068
02:38:24.981 --> 02:38:26.150
<v Speaker 3>It's like a week long thing.</v>

4069
02:38:26.410 --> 02:38:28.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to walk for several doing</v>

4070
02:38:28.200 --> 02:38:30.950
<v Speaker 3>right now as we're talking to people and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of times those marches,</v>

4071
02:38:30.951 --> 02:38:34.820
<v Speaker 3>like the hardcore people start first and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I might show up Saturday afternoon.</v>

4072
02:38:34.821 --> 02:38:36.600
<v Speaker 3>Hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we walked this whole</v>

4073
02:38:41.020 --> 02:38:44.780
<v Speaker 3>jump out of a trailer makeup all in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Charlottesville a few days ago,</v>

4074
02:38:44.781 --> 02:38:47.120
<v Speaker 3>but yes man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we walked a long way.</v>

4075
02:38:47.121 --> 02:38:49.940
<v Speaker 3>Remember that fun adventure we had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's people right now who are</v>

4076
02:38:49.941 --> 02:38:52.430
<v Speaker 3>walking from Charlottesville to defeat</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're like saying we have to</v>

4077
02:38:52.431 --> 02:38:54.560
<v Speaker 3>sort of keep the pressure on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's exhausting to do that.</v>

4078
02:38:54.590 --> 02:38:57.470
<v Speaker 3>Not everybody can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much it helps because I</v>

4079
02:38:57.500 --> 02:38:59.720
<v Speaker 3>remember the women's march totally on</v>
<v Speaker 3>acknowledged.</v>

4080
02:38:59.721 --> 02:39:01.970
<v Speaker 3>She never said a thing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's millions of people all over the</v>

4081
02:39:01.971 --> 02:39:04.790
<v Speaker 3>world marching against them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People weren't pussy hats.</v>

4082
02:39:04.791 --> 02:39:06.310
<v Speaker 3>Nobody cared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just didn't.</v>

4083
02:39:06.320 --> 02:39:07.400
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't seem to respond.</v>

4084
02:39:07.400 --> 02:39:09.170
<v Speaker 3>I think sometimes it's not about like</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether the,</v>

4085
02:39:09.280 --> 02:39:11.960
<v Speaker 3>whether the people in power care,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's whether the people care and it gets</v>

4086
02:39:12.020 --> 02:39:14.730
<v Speaker 3>people energized to do the next thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that like,</v>

4087
02:39:15.140 --> 02:39:18.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the march on Washington that king did</v>

4088
02:39:18.390 --> 02:39:21.710
<v Speaker 3>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't go and the next day like you</v>

4089
02:39:21.720 --> 02:39:23.690
<v Speaker 3>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it certainly becomes a historical</v>

4090
02:39:23.691 --> 02:39:27.600
<v Speaker 3>moment that people didn't look for and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it also becomes like everybody,</v>

4091
02:39:27.601 --> 02:39:29.480
<v Speaker 3>not every but most people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their homes that I were talking about</v>

4092
02:39:29.481 --> 02:39:31.970
<v Speaker 3>the women's March and it starts the</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that like,</v>

4093
02:39:31.971 --> 02:39:33.110
<v Speaker 3>it's the same thing with marriage</v>
<v Speaker 3>equality,</v>

4094
02:39:33.111 --> 02:39:34.580
<v Speaker 3>like it starts to open up people's</v>
<v Speaker 3>brains,</v>

4095
02:39:34.581 --> 02:39:35.600
<v Speaker 3>so like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah man,</v>

4096
02:39:35.601 --> 02:39:37.490
<v Speaker 3>what were they talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some people are having bad</v>

4097
02:39:37.491 --> 02:39:40.250
<v Speaker 3>conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's to me it's like it opens up as</v>

4098
02:39:40.251 --> 02:39:42.410
<v Speaker 3>long as you keep the conversation going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a potential for change.</v>

4099
02:39:42.440 --> 02:39:43.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just takes time.</v>

4100
02:39:43.610 --> 02:39:46.760
<v Speaker 3>So there's an old expression that comes</v>
<v Speaker 3>to gambling and also it can be applied</v>

4101
02:39:46.761 --> 02:39:50.180
<v Speaker 3>to weight loss and a bunch of other</v>
<v Speaker 3>things in life that you get better the</v>

4102
02:39:50.181 --> 02:39:51.930
<v Speaker 3>same way you got sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4103
02:39:52.120 --> 02:39:55.280
<v Speaker 3>like with gambling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you can't just win it all back.</v>

4104
02:39:55.860 --> 02:39:58.790
<v Speaker 3>It takes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to slowly try to chip away and</v>

4105
02:39:58.791 --> 02:40:01.460
<v Speaker 3>get back and it was weight loss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't just lose all that weight.</v>

4106
02:40:01.610 --> 02:40:04.070
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't happen like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how long did it take you to get</v>

4107
02:40:04.071 --> 02:40:04.581
<v Speaker 3>fat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4108
02:40:04.581 --> 02:40:07.160
<v Speaker 3>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna take you a similar amount of</v>

4109
02:40:07.161 --> 02:40:08.850
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe longer to lose them.</v>

4110
02:40:09.190 --> 02:40:14.100
<v Speaker 3>Could very well and I think for our</v>
<v Speaker 3>culture it's gonna take awhile</v>

4111
02:40:14.190 --> 02:40:17.430
<v Speaker 2>to sort all this out and I think we also</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a problem that the,</v>

4112
02:40:17.820 --> 02:40:22.110
<v Speaker 2>the actual operating system that we use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this whole representative government</v>

4113
02:40:22.111 --> 02:40:27.090
<v Speaker 2>that was set up back when you had to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a letter by horse to get to people</v>

4114
02:40:27.330 --> 02:40:29.960
<v Speaker 2>like it's really not necessary anymore</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's.</v>

4115
02:40:29.961 --> 02:40:33.750
<v Speaker 2>It creates a lot of red tape and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>creates a lot of bureaucratic</v>

4116
02:40:33.840 --> 02:40:38.610
<v Speaker 2>inefficiency that I think if we had to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had no government right now we're</v>

4117
02:40:38.611 --> 02:40:42.210
<v Speaker 2>trying to structure a government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last thing we do is have one person</v>

4118
02:40:42.211 --> 02:40:45.970
<v Speaker 2>with incredible amount of power that</v>
<v Speaker 2>could also launch the nukes and pardon</v>

4119
02:40:45.971 --> 02:40:47.490
<v Speaker 2>criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We wouldn't have that.</v>

4120
02:40:47.790 --> 02:40:51.780
<v Speaker 2>We'd never set that up like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would put in like the offices with</v>

4121
02:40:51.781 --> 02:40:56.781
<v Speaker 2>cubicles that are in a semicircle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably have like a council of wise</v>

4122
02:40:57.360 --> 02:41:00.050
<v Speaker 2>presidential council with people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are like math,</v>

4123
02:41:00.240 --> 02:41:02.940
<v Speaker 2>mathematics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>professors that understand economics and</v>

4124
02:41:02.941 --> 02:41:06.900
<v Speaker 2>people that understand geography and</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand cultural differences.</v>

4125
02:41:06.900 --> 02:41:07.800
<v Speaker 2>People that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4126
02:41:08.150 --> 02:41:12.120
<v Speaker 2>that really understand healthcare that</v>
<v Speaker 2>really understand all the different</v>

4127
02:41:12.121 --> 02:41:13.860
<v Speaker 2>things we wouldn't to make like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Supreme Court,</v>

4128
02:41:13.880 --> 02:41:15.970
<v Speaker 2>a lifetime appointment you would go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4129
02:41:16.020 --> 02:41:18.240
<v Speaker 2>you get it for 20 years and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4130
02:41:18.241 --> 02:41:19.140
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>

4131
02:41:19.260 --> 02:41:21.030
<v Speaker 2>And we wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no.</v>

4132
02:41:21.060 --> 02:41:23.790
<v Speaker 2>This is the thing we don't think</v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrats focus enough on unless they're</v>

4133
02:41:23.791 --> 02:41:28.020
<v Speaker 2>doing it behind closed doors that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>would not have the electoral college no</v>

4134
02:41:28.021 --> 02:41:29.550
<v Speaker 2>fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would not know.</v>

4135
02:41:29.551 --> 02:41:31.680
<v Speaker 2>Nobody can sell it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody could.</v>

4136
02:41:31.710 --> 02:41:35.480
<v Speaker 2>Nobody could tell you why it makes sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>now is important to me.</v>

4137
02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:38.220
<v Speaker 2>Settle down how important everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 2>important,</v>

4138
02:41:38.221 --> 02:41:39.720
<v Speaker 2>but it's even more important than</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody else.</v>

4139
02:41:40.140 --> 02:41:41.220
<v Speaker 2>One person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one vote,</v>

4140
02:41:41.221 --> 02:41:42.060
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just,</v>

4141
02:41:42.061 --> 02:41:42.870
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're looking at this.</v>

4142
02:41:42.870 --> 02:41:45.090
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like every election boils down to like</v>

4143
02:41:45.091 --> 02:41:47.280
<v Speaker 2>four or five states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

4144
02:41:47.370 --> 02:41:49.500
<v Speaker 2>Like in California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the time the polls closed,</v>

4145
02:41:49.501 --> 02:41:51.480
<v Speaker 2>they tell you who won because like we</v>
<v Speaker 2>know how California voted.</v>

4146
02:41:51.480 --> 02:41:54.450
<v Speaker 2>So then I become a person who was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was the point in me voting for</v>

4147
02:41:54.880 --> 02:41:55.650
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4148
02:41:55.650 --> 02:41:57.900
<v Speaker 2>so for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>electoral college and then</v>

4149
02:41:58.350 --> 02:42:00.310
<v Speaker 2>gerrymandering where the whole thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they get to sort of,</v>

4150
02:42:00.320 --> 02:42:03.060
<v Speaker 2>they divide your neighborhood up into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>way that sort of fits the,</v>

4151
02:42:03.480 --> 02:42:06.930
<v Speaker 2>those are the things that are really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why it's scary about who comes</v>

4152
02:42:06.931 --> 02:42:09.330
<v Speaker 2>after trump because as long as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>electoral college exists,</v>

4153
02:42:09.540 --> 02:42:11.730
<v Speaker 2>it automatically sort of tips the</v>
<v Speaker 2>country to more,</v>

4154
02:42:11.740 --> 02:42:14.940
<v Speaker 2>sort of right leaning direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

4155
02:42:14.941 --> 02:42:17.700
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now we just may be fine except when</v>

4156
02:42:17.701 --> 02:42:18.990
<v Speaker 2>the right becomes trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4157
02:42:18.991 --> 02:42:19.441
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4158
02:42:19.441 --> 02:42:21.870
<v Speaker 2>if it's different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's president John Mccain,</v>

4159
02:42:21.871 --> 02:42:24.090
<v Speaker 2>which I'm not a huge John Mccain fan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like at least there's a</v>

4160
02:42:24.120 --> 02:42:25.230
<v Speaker 2>through line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

4161
02:42:25.730 --> 02:42:28.350
<v Speaker 2>So for me it's like the electoral</v>
<v Speaker 2>college is never.</v>

4162
02:42:28.380 --> 02:42:30.630
<v Speaker 2>That's why the left has to fight so</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>

4163
02:42:30.780 --> 02:42:33.570
<v Speaker 2>And I feel like if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer art in</v>

4164
02:42:33.571 --> 02:42:36.570
<v Speaker 2>hallways already meetings right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fuck this electoral college,</v>

4165
02:42:36.571 --> 02:42:39.150
<v Speaker 2>have we got to take it down?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we're sort of losing the plot of</v>

4166
02:42:39.151 --> 02:42:40.020
<v Speaker 2>how this works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4167
02:42:40.021 --> 02:42:42.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's necessary anymore and</v>
<v Speaker 2>this idea that,</v>

4168
02:42:42.091 --> 02:42:44.130
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people in the middle needed because</v>

4169
02:42:44.131 --> 02:42:47.400
<v Speaker 2>the people on the coasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the large population centers,</v>

4170
02:42:47.430 --> 02:42:48.241
<v Speaker 2>they can dictate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4171
02:42:48.241 --> 02:42:49.190
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's more</v>

4172
02:42:51.470 --> 02:42:53.430
<v Speaker 2>people there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the actual country.</v>

4173
02:42:53.431 --> 02:42:53.971
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4174
02:42:53.971 --> 02:42:55.250
<v Speaker 2>There's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why they</v>

4175
02:42:56.790 --> 02:42:58.970
<v Speaker 2>are out here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking our kids in the middle.</v>

4176
02:43:00.240 --> 02:43:05.240
<v Speaker 2>That's not what people did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People define as most like we have more</v>

4177
02:43:05.881 --> 02:43:06.491
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

4178
02:43:06.491 --> 02:43:08.910
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got more land that's not the same.</v>

4179
02:43:09.030 --> 02:43:11.560
<v Speaker 2>Each of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all supposed to in this thing</v>

4180
02:43:11.561 --> 02:43:16.180
<v Speaker 2>together and it would be a way more</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting war board election if</v>

4181
02:43:16.181 --> 02:43:19.520
<v Speaker 2>everybody knew that just counting the</v>
<v Speaker 2>votes and there's a Paul in the middle</v>

4182
02:43:20.070 --> 02:43:22.570
<v Speaker 2>and politics would have to work way</v>
<v Speaker 2>harder instead of going,</v>

4183
02:43:22.571 --> 02:43:22.940
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna.</v>

4184
02:43:22.940 --> 02:43:26.290
<v Speaker 2>Go talk to people in the up and down</v>
<v Speaker 2>California because that's already set.</v>

4185
02:43:26.350 --> 02:43:29.290
<v Speaker 2>You don't think there's an issue with</v>
<v Speaker 2>states to or think there's an issue with</v>

4186
02:43:29.291 --> 02:43:33.060
<v Speaker 2>people voting like we lost California</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Nevada has gone to.</v>

4187
02:43:33.330 --> 02:43:36.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does think it's should be just one</v>

4188
02:43:36.280 --> 02:43:40.360
<v Speaker 2>lump group of humans that let's all vote</v>
<v Speaker 2>on stuff and there's good people</v>

4189
02:43:40.361 --> 02:43:42.040
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's good people in Iowa,</v>

4190
02:43:42.041 --> 02:43:44.680
<v Speaker 2>there's good people in Kansas is good</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in California.</v>

4191
02:43:45.040 --> 02:43:46.060
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4192
02:43:46.090 --> 02:43:49.990
<v Speaker 2>we got to stop all this divisiveness and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's one of the issues that</v>

4193
02:43:49.991 --> 02:43:53.040
<v Speaker 2>comes along with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's people that you have</v>

4194
02:43:53.080 --> 02:43:54.550
<v Speaker 2>intercity competition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4195
02:43:54.551 --> 02:43:55.750
<v Speaker 2>Fuck Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4196
02:43:55.751 --> 02:43:59.620
<v Speaker 2>like people get like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get into these teams when it comes to</v>

4197
02:43:59.621 --> 02:44:01.990
<v Speaker 2>the United States of America when it</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes to being the president.</v>

4198
02:44:01.991 --> 02:44:05.920
<v Speaker 2>I did genuinely think that we have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at ourselves as one group of</v>

4199
02:44:05.921 --> 02:44:06.754
<v Speaker 2>humans.</v>

4200
02:44:06.880 --> 02:44:08.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we should at least feel like</v>

4201
02:44:08.321 --> 02:44:11.020
<v Speaker 2>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that each of our voices counts and we're</v>

4202
02:44:11.021 --> 02:44:13.060
<v Speaker 2>in it together that he drove because</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now it's like,</v>

4203
02:44:13.061 --> 02:44:15.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you live in does it doesn't have a lab</v>

4204
02:44:16.100 --> 02:44:19.720
<v Speaker 2>roles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The east coast or delusional.</v>

4205
02:44:19.721 --> 02:44:23.110
<v Speaker 2>They don't have an understanding of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>real people of America.</v>

4206
02:44:23.530 --> 02:44:25.430
<v Speaker 2>That voice is horrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scary voice.</v>

4207
02:44:25.830 --> 02:44:30.310
<v Speaker 2>It's a real person out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In my head I felt like I was just with a</v>

4208
02:44:30.311 --> 02:44:31.210
<v Speaker 2>d,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had like a moment of like,</v>

4209
02:44:31.211 --> 02:44:33.870
<v Speaker 2>what does happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just put my hood on like it.</v>

02:44:33.920 --> 02:44:35.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you how to burn a crowd.</v>

4211
02:44:35.990 --> 02:44:38.510
<v Speaker 2>You could be like a funny joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meet the funny voice comedian</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that we [inaudible] the thing is</v>

4216
02:44:45.731 --> 02:44:47.410
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is one thing I'll say about united</v>

4217
02:44:47.411 --> 02:44:48.820
<v Speaker 2>shades when I go to the south side of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chicago,</v>

4218
02:44:48.821 --> 02:44:52.720
<v Speaker 2>we didn't upset about gangs and gang</v>
<v Speaker 2>violence and gang violence in south and</v>

4219
02:44:52.721 --> 02:44:57.620
<v Speaker 2>west side of Chicago and I did an</v>
<v Speaker 2>episode apalasia about mostly about coal</v>

4220
02:44:57.660 --> 02:45:00.970
<v Speaker 2>and the coal industry and how it's dying</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even people they're note yet to die.</v>

4221
02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.120
<v Speaker 2>You know when trump comes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them cheer because they're</v>

4222
02:45:03.121 --> 02:45:03.954
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do we just need.</v>

4223
02:45:03.960 --> 02:45:06.760
<v Speaker 2>What were they cheering for his jobs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not cheering for coal</v>

4224
02:45:06.761 --> 02:45:09.460
<v Speaker 2>necessarily course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you said we have other jobs for you,</v>

4225
02:45:09.461 --> 02:45:10.600
<v Speaker 2>they'll take those jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now.</v>

4226
02:45:10.601 --> 02:45:12.430
<v Speaker 2>They do have pride in the culture that</v>
<v Speaker 2>coal,</v>

4227
02:45:12.550 --> 02:45:14.140
<v Speaker 2>the coal culture because it's about</v>
<v Speaker 2>their life,</v>

4228
02:45:14.141 --> 02:45:15.510
<v Speaker 2>but they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't have to be that,</v>

4229
02:45:15.820 --> 02:45:18.220
<v Speaker 2>but all I'm saying is people in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Appalachian who voted for trump,</v>

4230
02:45:18.370 --> 02:45:22.060
<v Speaker 2>people in Chicago who voted for Hillary</v>
<v Speaker 2>are all just worried about jobs and</v>

4231
02:45:22.061 --> 02:45:23.800
<v Speaker 2>better schools for their kids and</v>
<v Speaker 2>safety.</v>

4232
02:45:23.910 --> 02:45:24.743
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4233
02:45:25.060 --> 02:45:27.820
<v Speaker 2>they're so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when we break it down to this left,</v>

4234
02:45:27.821 --> 02:45:28.241
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

4237
02:45:29.230 --> 02:45:32.530
<v Speaker 2>It starts to change the conversation</v>
<v Speaker 2>when really there is a party and some</v>

4238
02:45:32.531 --> 02:45:34.630
<v Speaker 2>people would say it's the Green party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is up there,</v>

4239
02:45:34.640 --> 02:45:35.680
<v Speaker 2>up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is nothing.</v>

4240
02:45:35.740 --> 02:45:38.950

<v Speaker 2>ideas and not the where these other</v>
