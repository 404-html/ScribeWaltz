00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.650
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.560
<v Speaker 1>I know my memory is unreliable.</v>

3
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:05.940
<v Speaker 1>That's what the point I'm at.</v>

4
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.150
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

5
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.820
<v Speaker 2>I can mind everybody's memories.</v>

6
00:00:09.821 --> 00:00:10.960
<v Speaker 2>Unreliable people,</v>

7
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.310
<v Speaker 2>they morph their memories to make them more convenient for their knowledge of</v>

8
00:00:15.311 --> 00:00:16.130
<v Speaker 2>the past,</v>

9
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:21.130
<v Speaker 2>whether it's as them as a victim or as them as the winner or as them as the,</v>

10
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

11
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.170
<v Speaker 2>oh I didn't get my fair shake.</v>

12
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.861
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

13
00:00:23.861 --> 00:00:26.050
<v Speaker 2>there was some behind the scenes shenanigans.</v>

14
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.120
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile it's,</v>

15
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.080
<v Speaker 2>you are a fucking idiot.</v>

16
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.183
<v Speaker 2>Reliable,</v>

17
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.870
<v Speaker 2>but they're going to use this machine.</v>

18
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.081
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

19
00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:32.914
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

20
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.030
<v Speaker 2>They're not ready yet.</v>

21
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.080
<v Speaker 2>But one day they will,</v>

22
00:00:35.081 --> 00:00:37.270
<v Speaker 2>one day we'll be able to access each other's brains.</v>

23
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.101
<v Speaker 2>Just like you,</v>

24
00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:39.070
<v Speaker 2>we send each other photos.</v>

25
00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:41.320
<v Speaker 2>Like if you were somewhere cool and you sent me a photo and get it on my phone,</v>

26
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.870
<v Speaker 2>we're getting you going to be able to see my,</v>

27
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:43.390
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

28
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be able to,</v>

29
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

30
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.790
<v Speaker 2>put public.</v>

31
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.931
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

32
00:00:46.931 --> 00:00:47.171
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

33
00:00:47.171 --> 00:00:48.020
<v Speaker 2>I want make my uh,</v>

34
00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:50.140
<v Speaker 2>my eyesight public cause I'm at Yellowstone,</v>

35
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.771
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

36
00:00:50.771 --> 00:00:54.970
<v Speaker 2>and you'd go public with your vision and you show everybody else and he can put</v>

37
00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:56.890
<v Speaker 2>it up on a database where people draw from.</v>

38
00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.000
<v Speaker 2>That'd be like the first step.</v>

39
00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.680
<v Speaker 2>People will share their experiences.</v>

40
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.540
<v Speaker 2>A few people sneak in porn or them jerking off before I park people.</v>

41
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.920
<v Speaker 2>People get to share experiences and then it'll just go to a,</v>

42
00:01:08.921 --> 00:01:09.910
<v Speaker 2>Hey I'm Carl,</v>

00:01:15.881 --> 00:01:18.010
<v Speaker 2>you can watch them at Sachs and people just start,</v>

48
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.270
<v Speaker 2>they only live their life.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Can't wait to get home with be Carl is it can't wait to cross out there just</v>

00:01:22.691 --> 00:01:25.480
<v Speaker 2>doing ecstasy and bag and bitches driving the fast lane.</v>

51
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.983
<v Speaker 2>The animal.</v>

52
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.290
<v Speaker 2>If Carl's channel became public,</v>

53
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.030
<v Speaker 2>everybody would want to just be inside.</v>

54
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.923
<v Speaker 2>Cross.</v>

55
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

56
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.340
<v Speaker 2>You can be the hottest selling.</v>

57
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.200
<v Speaker 2>And people would start complaining.</v>

58
00:01:35.201 --> 00:01:35.561
<v Speaker 2>They would say,</v>

59
00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:36.310
<v Speaker 2>look man,</v>

60
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.290
<v Speaker 2>nobody is living in a real life anymore.</v>

61
00:01:38.291 --> 00:01:40.120
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's living other people's lives.</v>

62
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.200
<v Speaker 2>Came up with a great concept movie.</v>

63
00:01:42.201 --> 00:01:42.870
<v Speaker 2>You doing it right?</v>

64
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:43.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

65
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.890
<v Speaker 2>because your life is boring as fuck,</v>

66
00:01:44.891 --> 00:01:46.180
<v Speaker 2>but you could just be a Carl.</v>

67
00:01:46.181 --> 00:01:47.380
<v Speaker 2>Carl is out there,</v>

68
00:01:47.381 --> 00:01:48.940
<v Speaker 2>Baldwin and it.</v>

69
00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:51.130
<v Speaker 2>Paul gets Carl gets shot.</v>

70
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.760
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

71
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.440
<v Speaker 2>You're used to go back to regular life.</v>

72
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.960
<v Speaker 2>That's the risk because then you'd have to find a new channel to subscribe to.</v>

73
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.450
<v Speaker 2>You know Carl's dead.</v>

74
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.640
<v Speaker 2>You're just going to follow Eddie for TV shows.</v>

75
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.690
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

76
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.370
<v Speaker 2>I follow Eddie calls best friend.</v>

77
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.780
<v Speaker 2>That will be a new art form.</v>

78
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.250
<v Speaker 2>The new art form would be living your life in a spectacular manner to which some</v>

79
00:02:09.251 --> 00:02:13.600
<v Speaker 2>people would want to actually give up being a real person so they could be you</v>

80
00:02:13.601 --> 00:02:18.370
<v Speaker 2>and experience it directly and you will become a million people.</v>

81
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.750
<v Speaker 2>They see through you.</v>

82
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.480
<v Speaker 2>We not exactly sure whether or not they influence Carl.</v>

83
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.300
<v Speaker 2>We think that Carl is acting independently,</v>

84
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.490
<v Speaker 2>but it is possible if you think about it,</v>

85
00:02:27.491 --> 00:02:31.900
<v Speaker 2>that all those minds linked up together could form one unique and universal</v>

86
00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:33.760
<v Speaker 2>direction in which crawl might want to go.</v>

87
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

88
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.490
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of like Instagram right now.</v>

89
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:37.631
<v Speaker 1>That's bananas,</v>

90
00:02:37.631 --> 00:02:38.740
<v Speaker 1>but you're talking about,</v>

91
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking it to the next level sign</v>

92
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.680
<v Speaker 1>because if call realizes he gets a lot of views what he's doing,</v>

93
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.690
<v Speaker 1>then he's going to do more threesomes course and if he gets a lot of views when</v>

94
00:02:50.691 --> 00:02:52.960
<v Speaker 1>he realizes that he's on a plane or in a Jacuzzi,</v>

95
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.240
<v Speaker 2>he's got a doer that look,</v>

96
00:02:56.241 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 2>when a guy gets recognized for being a big fat guy and like gets famous for</v>

97
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:00.994
<v Speaker 2>being a fat guy.</v>

98
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.710
<v Speaker 2>If you ever seen one of those guys,</v>

99
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:05.170
<v Speaker 2>talked to their agents and the agents will tell you,</v>

100
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:06.550
<v Speaker 2>I've seen in half with my own eyes,</v>

101
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:07.631
<v Speaker 2>don't lose weight,</v>

102
00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:08.170
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

103
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.921
<v Speaker 2>If you lose weight,</v>

104
00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna lose roles.</v>

105
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:10.510
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

106
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.260
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>

107
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.060
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>

108
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 2>because they've locked onto the idea of you as the fat guy.</v>

109
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:16.323
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

110
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:17.710
<v Speaker 2>They just decide.</v>

111
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:19.170
<v Speaker 2>They decide.</v>

112
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.440

<v Speaker 2>People know they just keep eating so they'll stay fat and funny.</v>

117
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.450
<v Speaker 2>If you told the fat guy like,</v>

118
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.020
<v Speaker 2>hey dude,</v>
