<v Speaker 1>If you beat off and I know you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's way better than just regular </v>

<v Speaker 1>flashlight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something crazy warm water thing.</v>

67
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.490

<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

68
00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:58.491
<v Speaker 1>my landlords often go out in the back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke and then because they work above </v>

69
00:02:58.491 --> 00:03:01.660

<v Speaker 1>the sun,</v>

70
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:03.160

71
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

<v Speaker 1>website contains explicit adult </v>
<v Speaker 1>material.</v>

74
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.170

<v Speaker 1>to see explicit adult material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 1>do they have porn on their site?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but the girl had a bra and panties on.</v>

80
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.610
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're looking at all of these </v>

81
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.610
<v Speaker 1>flashlights,</v>

87
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.590

<v Speaker 1>store without them stopping and telling </v>

<v Speaker 1>I was like 20 and she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

118
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:09.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>older lady.</v>

119
00:05:09.711 --> 00:05:12.370
<v Speaker 1>So this is your first grade teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first grade teacher.</v>

120
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.290
<v Speaker 1>First grade is what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven,</v>

121
00:05:14.291 --> 00:05:15.570
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six.</v>

122
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

123
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.380
<v Speaker 1>And because I rang her up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also saw her last name was ms dot blah</v>

124
00:05:20.381 --> 00:05:21.160
<v Speaker 1>blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

125
00:05:21.161 --> 00:05:22.240
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's totally her.</v>

126
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.950
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she got the uh,</v>

127
00:05:23.951 --> 00:05:28.951
<v Speaker 1>that's when I found out that a semester </v>
<v Speaker 1>still alone did a porn called the </v>

128
00:05:28.951 --> 00:05:29.890
<v Speaker 1>Italian stallion and that's what she had</v>
<v Speaker 1>got.</v>

129
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.710
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think that was a real porn </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

130
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.350
<v Speaker 1>I think it was one of those like </v>
<v Speaker 1>showtime three in the morning,</v>

131
00:05:35.351 --> 00:05:36.100
<v Speaker 1>porns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

132
00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:37.830
<v Speaker 1>So I think that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

133
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.980
<v Speaker 1>I thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

134
00:05:38.981 --> 00:05:41.980
<v Speaker 1>this is for a gag this for a party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I accept this.</v>

135
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.120
<v Speaker 1>But see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could also see her whole history and </v>

136
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.120
<v Speaker 1>it was like big black Dick Five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

137
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.511
<v Speaker 1>it was only rented porn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sixty eight 70 maybe she was 70.</v>

138
00:05:52.231 --> 00:05:54.940
<v Speaker 1>That pitches of freak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

139
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Just keeping it alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

140
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who.</v>

141
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.140
<v Speaker 1>So you don't think that Italian stallion</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a report?</v>

142
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:05.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never watched it talking out of my </v>

143
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.290
<v Speaker 1>ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty sure it wasn't.</v>

144
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure it was like some fake </v>
<v Speaker 1>3:00</v>

145
00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:06.290
<v Speaker 1>in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

146
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.460
<v Speaker 1>we had the porn side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a chick that I,</v>

147
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:14.510
<v Speaker 1>I used to date in one of those fake 3:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning porns where a dude is </v>

148
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.210
<v Speaker 1>fake bone in her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I have to do,</v>

149
00:06:15.211 --> 00:06:17.060
<v Speaker 1>it was just a little too low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

150
00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Like she was like a pie a little too </v>
<v Speaker 1>high and he was like,</v>

151
00:06:19.941 --> 00:06:22.820
<v Speaker 1>you tell her their groin isn't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>touching one of those,</v>

152
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was really freaky.</v>

153
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.950
<v Speaker 1>I was by myself and I slipped through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the channels and it's like,</v>

154
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:28.610
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

156
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.960

<v Speaker 1>time ago.</v>

157
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.130
<v Speaker 1>So it was like I dated her over,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I've always thought that was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>weakest things ever.</v>

196
00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:02.740
<v Speaker 1>When someone you can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only reason why they're bringing </v>

197
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.250
<v Speaker 1>this up or they're talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>racks is to try to fuck with your head.</v>

198
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.590
<v Speaker 1>Like it never works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of that.</v>

199
00:08:06.591 --> 00:08:09.470
<v Speaker 1>It makes you feel uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the uncomfort that I feel is,</v>

200
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:14.570
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not as cool as I thought you </v>

<v Speaker 1>fuck with me and okay,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Can I tell you that this is not </v>

204
00:08:21.431 --> 00:08:21.431
<v Speaker 1>necessary?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're just,</v>

205
00:08:21.431 --> 00:08:26.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two people that are enjoying each </v>

206
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:26.200
<v Speaker 1>other's company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting to know each other.</v>

207
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:26.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have to play these stupid games</v>

208
00:08:26.301 --> 00:08:28.190
<v Speaker 1>that we've already played in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should all learn,</v>

209
00:08:28.191 --> 00:08:33.191
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I played some stupid games and it was a </v>

210
00:08:33.191 --> 00:08:33.191
<v Speaker 1>little kid then I had to learn that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're dumb.</v>

211
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:35.510
<v Speaker 1>So when someone doesn't know the games </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that are dumb,</v>

212
00:08:35.511 --> 00:08:37.640
<v Speaker 1>like jealousy games from like fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

213
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:39.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on man,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get out of here.</v>

216
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.720
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe it.</v>

217
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.960
<v Speaker 1>You're hot and you're 26 and another guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>is fucked you already.</v>

218
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.210
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was this recent?</v>

219
00:08:53.211 --> 00:08:58.211
<v Speaker 1>Was this with the pitches probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>sucking somebody's dick an hour before </v>

220
00:08:58.211 --> 00:08:58.350
<v Speaker 1>she picked you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

221
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:03.410
<v Speaker 1>she's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes me wonder if that should ever </v>

222
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.081
<v Speaker 1>go away because it doesn't seem like it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is like my mom get in a fight with her </v>

223
00:09:06.081 --> 00:09:07.950
<v Speaker 1>boyfriend and you just do stupid shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that goes away for sure.</v>

224
00:09:07.951 --> 00:09:10.380
<v Speaker 1>It goes away and went with maturity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything evolves.</v>

225
00:09:10.381 --> 00:09:15.381
<v Speaker 1>It's the problem is when people get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go from one shit relationship to </v>

226
00:09:15.381 --> 00:09:17.640
<v Speaker 1>the next shit relationship and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>never get traction as a human being.</v>

227
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:22.820
<v Speaker 1>Never get traction and never realized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you have shit friends on top of </v>

228
00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:22.820
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which a lot of girls do,</v>

229
00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:23.970
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially pretty girls,</v>

230
00:09:23.971 --> 00:09:24.730
<v Speaker 1>a lot of pretty girls.</v>

231
00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.580
<v Speaker 1>Their friends be hating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

232
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:30.400
<v Speaker 1>It's tough man because for them it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're out with a pretty girl.</v>

233
00:09:30.401 --> 00:09:32.190
<v Speaker 1>If you're a girl and you're out with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty girl,</v>

234
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:35.040
<v Speaker 1>no one is going to pay attention to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's going to pay any attention to</v>

235
00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:40.041
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she didn't even do anything to </v>

236
00:09:40.041 --> 00:09:40.041
<v Speaker 1>deserve this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was just born this way and you're so</v>

237
00:09:40.041 --> 00:09:45.021
<v Speaker 1>much funnier and so much cooler and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be so much pedal girlfriend and </v>

238
00:09:45.021 --> 00:09:46.500
<v Speaker 1>you will get crazy for that bitch and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll try to trip her up.</v>

239
00:09:46.501 --> 00:09:51.501
<v Speaker 1>You'll want her to fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will hope she falls and breaks her </v>

240
00:09:51.501 --> 00:09:51.501
<v Speaker 1>fucking nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

241
00:09:51.501 --> 00:09:53.520
<v Speaker 1>like literally like you're tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's stealing from you.</v>

242
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.300
<v Speaker 1>She stealing mail attention from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

243
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:58.200
<v Speaker 1>That's how a lot of chicks feel about </v>
<v Speaker 1>hot chicks,</v>

244
00:09:58.201 --> 00:09:59.400
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't like it.</v>

245
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.560
<v Speaker 1>So anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

246
00:10:01.561 --> 00:10:03.150
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's your situation,</v>

247
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:08.540
<v Speaker 1>if you're around people like that or do </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit to you and you've around ex </v>

248
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:08.540
<v Speaker 1>boyfriends were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do she,</v>

249
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:08.540
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>

250
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:13.251
<v Speaker 1>you can get into a bad grind where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just automatically get douchey first </v>

251
00:10:13.251 --> 00:10:17.271
<v Speaker 1>because you think they're going to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>douchey first and you want to get the </v>

252
00:10:17.271 --> 00:10:17.271
<v Speaker 1>upper hand.</v>

253
00:10:17.271 --> 00:10:17.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ever getting those relationships,</v>

254
00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:22.680
<v Speaker 1>we can tell that someone's fucking with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just to get the upper hand and </v>

255
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.620
<v Speaker 1>expecting more and worse is when you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

256
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.690
<v Speaker 1>Just to see where it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The worst for me is if I get involved in</v>

257
00:10:30.691 --> 00:10:35.190
<v Speaker 1>it and I haven't been working out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when I was younger.</v>

258
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:36.930
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was younger,</v>

259
00:10:36.931 --> 00:10:41.931
<v Speaker 1>I did not have such a good judgment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I still don't sometimes about when to </v>

260
00:10:41.931 --> 00:10:43.320
<v Speaker 1>argue and went to the school without </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

261
00:10:43.321 --> 00:10:44.850
<v Speaker 1>Am I arguing over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back down.</v>

262
00:10:44.851 --> 00:10:46.470
<v Speaker 1>I just argued automatically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

263
00:10:46.471 --> 00:10:47.730
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to stop me from </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguing,</v>

264
00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:50.400
<v Speaker 1>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it would just turn ugly every time.</v>

265
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Every time I got an argument with </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody,</v>

266
00:10:51.721 --> 00:10:54.270
<v Speaker 1>it would turn ugly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as I got older,</v>

267
00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:59.480
<v Speaker 1>you know any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any kind of relationship like that when </v>

268
00:10:59.480 --> 00:10:59.480
<v Speaker 1>shit comes up now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>

269
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.930
<v Speaker 1>I tried very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hard now to just look at it and go,</v>

270
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:05.310
<v Speaker 1>what is the purpose of all this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What or who gives a shit?</v>

271
00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.020
<v Speaker 1>If you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who gives a shit?</v>

272
00:11:07.021 --> 00:11:08.250
<v Speaker 1>If you're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who gets,</v>

273
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:13.640
<v Speaker 1>here's what I want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be around people that I enjoy </v>

274
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.381
<v Speaker 1>talking to and I know there can't really</v>
<v Speaker 1>be this many problems that we fight all </v>

275
00:11:16.381 --> 00:11:20.841
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's this many problems that we </v>

276
00:11:20.841 --> 00:11:20.841
<v Speaker 1>fight all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's that coming from?</v>

277
00:11:20.841 --> 00:11:25.100
<v Speaker 1>That's got to be a personality thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't have that many problems </v>

278
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:25.100
<v Speaker 1>in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Life's pretty smooth.</v>

279
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.550
<v Speaker 1>Most of the people in my life were very </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>

280
00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Most of the people in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we enjoy each other's company.</v>

281
00:11:29.271 --> 00:11:34.271
<v Speaker 1>The very few.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean everybody has like here and </v>

282
00:11:34.271 --> 00:11:36.981
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'll be issues with any human being </v>

283
00:11:36.981 --> 00:11:36.981
<v Speaker 1>where someone sees something totally </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently,</v>

284
00:11:36.981 --> 00:11:37.770
<v Speaker 1>but you can talk it through and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really good friends,</v>

285
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.140
<v Speaker 1>you're work it out and everything's cool</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nobody ever gets ugly,</v>

286
00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:46.580
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the real key man is finding other </v>

287
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:50.121
<v Speaker 1>people that go along with that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you go with someone who's </v>

288
00:11:50.121 --> 00:11:53.120
<v Speaker 1>used to do shit and is used to insulting</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and is used to playing games,</v>

289
00:11:53.381 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you go</v>

290
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.080
<v Speaker 2>into that and dive into that world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

291
00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:57.970
<v Speaker 2>you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No progress,</v>

292
00:11:58.390 --> 00:11:59.140
<v Speaker 2>no fun,</v>

293
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.380
<v Speaker 3>and it's so hard to get at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then once you get out of it,</v>

294
00:12:02.381 --> 00:12:05.080
<v Speaker 3>you're so sad because he got out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to get back in.</v>

295
00:12:05.081 --> 00:12:06.580
<v Speaker 3>It's his because he felt so sad for you.</v>

296
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:11.590
<v Speaker 2>Getting out of that being alone man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you just got out of a relationship </v>

297
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.590
<v Speaker 2>and then all of a sudden you're alone </v>
<v Speaker 2>and lonely.</v>

298
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:14.660
<v Speaker 2>Those are the darkest empty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hollow moments.</v>

299
00:12:14.661 --> 00:12:17.360
<v Speaker 2>As an adult human being that feelings a </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible,</v>

300
00:12:17.361 --> 00:12:22.361
<v Speaker 2>terrible feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people just aren't equipped to </v>

301
00:12:22.361 --> 00:12:22.760
<v Speaker 2>understand rationally what's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on,</v>

302
00:12:22.761 --> 00:12:26.270
<v Speaker 2>like why are you so upset?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much of this is just evolutionary?</v>

303
00:12:26.271 --> 00:12:31.271
<v Speaker 2>How much is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been designed into the whole human </v>

304
00:12:31.271 --> 00:12:34.391
<v Speaker 2>mechanism too dreadful to feel dreadful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time you're left alone to feel </v>

305
00:12:35.181 --> 00:12:36.890
<v Speaker 2>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time you're rejected,</v>

306
00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:41.150
<v Speaker 2>you're being rejected by someone you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't even know is brutally painful.</v>

307
00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:42.820
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is?</v>

308
00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.680
<v Speaker 2>Why would you even care if it was a dude</v>
<v Speaker 2>who didn't like you?</v>

309
00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.420
<v Speaker 2>If you had no desire to fuck that </v>
<v Speaker 2>person?</v>

310
00:12:47.421 --> 00:12:49.010
<v Speaker 2>If you just came up to a dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that dude was like,</v>

311
00:12:49.011 --> 00:12:49.430
<v Speaker 2>look at you.</v>

312
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:51.170
<v Speaker 2>You don't even good looking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be like,</v>

313
00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.770
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck you faggot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't care at all.</v>

314
00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.690
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't change your opinion of </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself at all,</v>

315
00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:59.060
<v Speaker 2>but when a chick does it to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like devastating.</v>

316
00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:04.290
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially if it's a chick that you're </v>

317
00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:04.290
<v Speaker 2>attracted to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's all evolution.</v>

318
00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:08.380
<v Speaker 2>It's all set up that way to try to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>you to be as attractive as possible and </v>

319
00:13:09.081 --> 00:13:14.081
<v Speaker 2>to make very stringent standards that </v>
<v Speaker 2>what people find and don't find a </v>

320
00:13:14.081 --> 00:13:18.291
<v Speaker 2>traction attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's to make you operate at a higher </v>

321
00:13:18.291 --> 00:13:21.761
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's all just designed to make </v>

322
00:13:21.761 --> 00:13:24.821
<v Speaker 2>you work harder as a human being to </v>
<v Speaker 2>become more impressive as a mate and in </v>

323
00:13:24.821 --> 00:13:27.350
<v Speaker 2>doing so and it becoming more impressive</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a mate,</v>

324
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:30.560
<v Speaker 2>you get to contribute more to society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll create more energy.</v>

325
00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.710
<v Speaker 2>You'll create more money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll create more whatever you do,</v>

326
00:13:33.711 --> 00:13:34.570
<v Speaker 2>whether you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't,</v>

327
00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:36.650
<v Speaker 2>you know your technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll innovate more.</v>

328
00:13:36.651 --> 00:13:38.360
<v Speaker 2>If you're an art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're producing more art.</v>

329
00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:40.670
<v Speaker 2>You want to prove your worth and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

330
00:13:40.671 --> 00:13:43.730
<v Speaker 2>that craziness like allows people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>shine.</v>

331
00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:44.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

332
00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:47.730
<v Speaker 3>I can't find that girl though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know I can't.</v>

333
00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.850
<v Speaker 3>I can't find that partner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas on the same level as me,</v>

334
00:13:50.851 --> 00:13:51.920
<v Speaker 3>it seems like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

335
00:13:51.921 --> 00:13:54.120
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>always act like the same level,</v>

336
00:13:54.121 --> 00:13:56.100
<v Speaker 3>but then once you get into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just,</v>

337
00:13:56.190 --> 00:14:01.190
<v Speaker 3>they were just like kind of mimicking </v>
<v Speaker 3>what they thought that that level is </v>

338
00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:01.190
<v Speaker 3>that</v>

339
00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:03.270
<v Speaker 2>also that they want you to be something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're not,</v>

340
00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:03.870
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

341
00:14:03.871 --> 00:14:06.060
<v Speaker 2>they want you to be a not even a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

342
00:14:06.061 --> 00:14:11.061
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a lot of people have an idea </v>

343
00:14:11.061 --> 00:14:11.061
<v Speaker 2>in their head that's really almost kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of based on movies,</v>

344
00:14:11.061 --> 00:14:11.280
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

345
00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:14.340
<v Speaker 2>what was it like like before the 18 </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds based on movies?</v>

346
00:14:14.341 --> 00:14:15.690
<v Speaker 2>Totally better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.220
<v Speaker 2>To everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's how it is.</v>

348
00:14:17.221 --> 00:14:22.221
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see movies and everything works out </v>

<v Speaker 2>Life is like this.</v>

352
00:14:23.551 --> 00:14:24.870
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is my model of life.</v>

353
00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:28.680
<v Speaker 2>Sandra bullock movies and you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get trapped in your head thinking,</v>

354
00:14:28.681 --> 00:14:30.960
<v Speaker 2>well maybe this isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he's not the one,</v>

355
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:32.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe there is another one.</v>

356
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:34.180
<v Speaker 2>Like God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this crazy?</v>

357
00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about you?</v>

358
00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:37.650
<v Speaker 2>Are you the one he probably not the one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

359
00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.060
<v Speaker 2>it might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be,</v>

360
00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:44.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking problem might be you over </v>

361
00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:44.080
<v Speaker 2>and over again with everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like,</v>

362
00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.450
<v Speaker 2>like the fight club or relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the whole time it actually is you.</v>

363
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.000
<v Speaker 2>Well Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been that guy.</v>

364
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Speaker 2>I've totally been that</v>

365
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.290
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but start arguments,</v>

366
00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.300
<v Speaker 1>relationships for no reason just because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was frustrated with my own life.</v>

367
00:14:56.301 --> 00:15:00.050
<v Speaker 1>Especially when I was really young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was 20 when I was like 20 and 21.</v>

368
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it starts stupid arguments with girls.</v>

369
00:15:01.601 --> 00:15:04.880
<v Speaker 1>I was dating over nothing but it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really them.</v>

370
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:06.710
<v Speaker 1>That was the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really me.</v>

371
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
<v Speaker 1>It was really me like being frustrated </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time with my life and trying to </v>

372
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.791
<v Speaker 1>like being like hyper ambitious and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to like get ahead in my life but </v>

373
00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:17.510
<v Speaker 1>really terrified that I was going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>a loser.</v>

374
00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:22.780
<v Speaker 1>So I would always be like under stress </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if anything annoys me about a check,</v>

375
00:15:22.791 --> 00:15:24.740
<v Speaker 1>I would like been like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you even talk like that?</v>

376
00:15:24.741 --> 00:15:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

377
00:15:25.611 --> 00:15:29.570
<v Speaker 1>that's such a douchey thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take your frustrations out on someone</v>

378
00:15:29.571 --> 00:15:30.980
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're doing it,</v>

379
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.330
<v Speaker 1>when it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're wrapped up in it,</v>

380
00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:37.331
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if that's like everyone in </v>

381
00:15:37.331 --> 00:15:37.331
<v Speaker 1>your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's everyone your friends with,</v>

382
00:15:37.331 --> 00:15:41.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the only way you know it takes a </v>

383
00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:41.600
<v Speaker 1>long time to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to not communicate shitty to people.</v>

384
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.930
<v Speaker 1>If you're stuck and like a shitty </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication pattern,</v>

385
00:15:44.931 --> 00:15:46.970
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's hard to snap out of that.</v>

386
00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Very hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hard to recognize how other people </v>

387
00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:56.351
<v Speaker 1>are seeing you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like so many people don't think that </v>

388
00:15:56.351 --> 00:15:58.751
<v Speaker 1>they come off as assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think they're just playing around </v>

389
00:15:58.751 --> 00:15:58.751
<v Speaker 1>and everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

390
00:15:58.751 --> 00:15:59.720
<v Speaker 1>this guy's such a Douche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get him away from me.</v>

391
00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:00.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

392
00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.600
<v Speaker 1>You can't take a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a joke of.</v>

393
00:16:02.601 --> 00:16:04.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

394
00:16:04.101 --> 00:16:05.900
<v Speaker 1>it's not a joke if no one else is </v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing,</v>

395
00:16:05.901 --> 00:16:07.160
<v Speaker 1>but you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a joke.</v>

396
00:16:07.161 --> 00:16:09.950
<v Speaker 1>That's you being a douchebag and </v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing about being a Douche bag.</v>

397
00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:12.290
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

399
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:18.500
<v Speaker 3>Old?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely not alcohol because it seems </v>

400
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.661
<v Speaker 3>like more in the end I've fixed your </v>
<v Speaker 3>vegas really taught me a lot about </v>

<v Speaker 3>alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>is just weird.</v>

403
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:27.570
<v Speaker 1>It does terrible things for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>judgment.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was fun.</v>

407
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:39.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with alcohol is everybody </v>

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.561
<v Speaker 1>else else's drinking too and you wind up</v>

<v Speaker 1>with them by far.</v>

424

<v Speaker 1>We went to dinner with them and talk to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them a lot.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And I've totally felt for something that</v>

431
00:17:28.211 --> 00:17:31.480
<v Speaker 3>happens to you every day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost it's where you go up to him like,</v>

432

436
00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:41.230
<v Speaker 3>a little different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But still that happens to me.</v>

<v Speaker 3>pop industry right now.</v>

463
00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:48.630
<v Speaker 3>The pump industry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Lindsay Lohan should be using pot.</v>

464
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:52.050
<v Speaker 3>The pato to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lindsay's going to do some time now.</v>

465
00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:54.930
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't know ladies gentlemen.</v>

466
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:56.790
<v Speaker 3>Brian says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where'd you read this off of?</v>

467
00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:59.240
<v Speaker 3>I watched it live on cbs life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

468
00:18:59.241 --> 00:19:01.800
<v Speaker 3>they put it on video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>live courtroom.</v>

469
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:06.830
<v Speaker 3>She's going to do 90 days in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is just to turn herself in two </v>

470
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:10.581
<v Speaker 3>weeks unless she suicides,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she still has to wear the bracelet </v>

471
00:19:10.581 --> 00:19:12.540
<v Speaker 3>so she can't drink every day and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>made it like a big deal.</v>

472
00:19:12.541 --> 00:19:16.080
<v Speaker 3>Like we want to switch to a blood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a blood thing instead of,</v>

473
00:19:16.081 --> 00:19:21.081
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the scram and the reason why she wants </v>

474
00:19:21.081 --> 00:19:21.081
<v Speaker 3>to do that because if you drink alcohol </v>
<v Speaker 3>at midnight,</v>

475
00:19:21.081 --> 00:19:21.870
<v Speaker 3>like by 4:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>AM,</v>

476
00:19:21.871 --> 00:19:24.330
<v Speaker 3>it's not in your blood anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why Lindsay wants to do that.</v>

477
00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:28.950
<v Speaker 3>So it's so funny that the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>really got to me was where they judge,</v>

478
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.950
<v Speaker 3>like heard Lindsey crying and stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the judge finally goes,</v>

479
00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:33.870
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you did live here,</v>

480
00:19:33.871 --> 00:19:35.220
<v Speaker 3>you live here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you live here,</v>

481
00:19:35.221 --> 00:19:37.560
<v Speaker 3>you lied here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Next case you live here,</v>

482
00:19:37.561 --> 00:19:39.350
<v Speaker 3>you live here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You went through like,</v>

483
00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:43.070
<v Speaker 3>like four cases of like seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know if Lockton,</v>

484
00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:46.970
<v Speaker 1>someone up in jail is like the best way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to deal with this,</v>

485
00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:51.590
<v Speaker 1>but this should all be a bright example </v>
<v Speaker 1>to people.</v>

486
00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:52.540
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

487
00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:54.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a prominent example to people.</v>

488
00:19:54.591 --> 00:19:57.020
<v Speaker 1>How you shouldn't make your fucking kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>famous.</v>

489
00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:02.440
<v Speaker 1>How many kids have to become incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up from being famous child actors</v>

490
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:06.650
<v Speaker 1>before we look at it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is nuts.</v>

491
00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.600
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you should be doing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a child.</v>

492
00:20:08.601 --> 00:20:12.050
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you should be developing </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a human being.</v>

493
00:20:12.051 --> 00:20:15.050
<v Speaker 1>Getting your shit together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting your ego together is hard enough</v>

494
00:20:15.051 --> 00:20:17.570
<v Speaker 1>as it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to have that developing,</v>

495
00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:20.780
<v Speaker 1>getting your shit together and then mix </v>
<v Speaker 1>it with fame.</v>

496
00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.310
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you imagine 10 years from now,</v>

497
00:20:23.311 --> 00:20:25.980
<v Speaker 3>will Smith's kids going to jump on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>back and slice or next,</v>

498
00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:32.940
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's probably just going to be sad or </v>

499
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:32.940
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fine.</v>

500
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:32.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a really brilliant guy.</v>

501
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:36.900
<v Speaker 1>He's a very smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might figure out a way to raise his </v>

502
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.950
<v Speaker 1>kid correctly through this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what an incredible fucking chore.</v>

503
00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:44.100
<v Speaker 1>What an incredible responsibility and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of pressure you put on the </v>

504
00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:44.260
<v Speaker 1>kid because kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

505
00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 1>they get spoiled so easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their perspective get fucked up</v>

506
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.530
<v Speaker 2>so quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They haven't really developed character.</v>

507
00:20:50.531 --> 00:20:55.531
<v Speaker 2>They tend to have a kid really be in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>position where he never really has to </v>

508
00:20:55.531 --> 00:20:56.080
<v Speaker 2>overcome the same adversity of the rest </v>
<v Speaker 2>of us have.</v>

509
00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:01.320
<v Speaker 2>He just doesn't have the opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>develop the character that the rest of </v>

510
00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.260
<v Speaker 2>us are going to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The regular people that have to go </v>

511
00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.631
<v Speaker 2>through life and make their way as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>adult and evolve as an adult and be an </v>

512
00:21:06.631 --> 00:21:07.710
<v Speaker 2>adult without money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where you're in a situation where you're</v>

513
00:21:07.711 --> 00:21:08.020
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

514
00:21:08.021 --> 00:21:13.021
<v Speaker 2>I've got to figure out a way to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>through this and to not have any fame </v>

515
00:21:13.021 --> 00:21:13.080
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

516
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:18.270
<v Speaker 2>have to get by on your personality </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of get by on the fact that </v>

517
00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:18.270
<v Speaker 2>you're famous when you were six.</v>

518
00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:18.330
<v Speaker 3>I heard that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

519
00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.670
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that first eight years of your life,</v>

520
00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:24.060
<v Speaker 3>you learn 88 percent of what makes you </v>
<v Speaker 3>who you are today.</v>

521
00:21:24.061 --> 00:21:29.061
<v Speaker 3>Like the things like from from walking </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the way to how you react to certain </v>

522
00:21:29.061 --> 00:21:30.930
<v Speaker 3>things and the rest is what you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>deal with,</v>

523
00:21:30.931 --> 00:21:33.360
<v Speaker 3>like your ram on those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

524
00:21:33.361 --> 00:21:33.990
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

525
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:39.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read some stuff about up to two </v>

526
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.190
<v Speaker 2>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't read up to eight,</v>

527
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:43.261
<v Speaker 2>but it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean a lot of who you are as a human </v>

528
00:21:43.261 --> 00:21:46.070
<v Speaker 2>being is based on what kind of input you</v>
<v Speaker 2>got when your mind was developing.</v>

529
00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:51.400
<v Speaker 2>It only makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your mind is going to prepare for a </v>

530
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:51.400
<v Speaker 2>certain world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

531
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.521
<v Speaker 2>they say that babies born into in into </v>
<v Speaker 2>really high stress violent families </v>

532
00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.590
<v Speaker 2>where there's a lot of shouting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>yelling and you know,</v>

533
00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:02.770
<v Speaker 2>too many people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you're in a really bad </v>

534
00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:04.541
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood and you know too many </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in your house and there's a lot </v>

535
00:22:04.541 --> 00:22:04.541
<v Speaker 2>of stress all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>

536
00:22:04.541 --> 00:22:07.580
<v Speaker 2>babies born literally are wired </v>
<v Speaker 2>different than babies that are born into</v>

537
00:22:07.581 --> 00:22:10.690
<v Speaker 2>calm households and babies that are born</v>
<v Speaker 2>into calm households.</v>

538
00:22:10.691 --> 00:22:14.210
<v Speaker 2>Like the less stress you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more chilled out the baby can be.</v>

539
00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:16.910
<v Speaker 2>But if you have like a really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really tense mom,</v>

540
00:22:16.911 --> 00:22:19.310
<v Speaker 2>that kid's going to come out just ready </v>
<v Speaker 2>to snap.</v>

541
00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.890
<v Speaker 2>That kid's going to come out recognizing</v>
<v Speaker 2>danger.</v>

542
00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:24.590
<v Speaker 2>I had this long talk on a plane with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Irvin.</v>

543
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:27.860
<v Speaker 2>Michael Irvin was on a plane to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia.</v>

544
00:22:27.861 --> 00:22:32.861
<v Speaker 2>We were all going to the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was going there to do some football </v>

545
00:22:32.861 --> 00:22:35.681
<v Speaker 2>thing with Russell Russell Crowe and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had met him because I did a best damn </v>

546
00:22:35.681 --> 00:22:38.300
<v Speaker 2>sports show period and he was on it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a real cool guy,</v>

547
00:22:38.301 --> 00:22:40.610
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And very down to Earth normal dude.</v>

548
00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.120
<v Speaker 2>And so he and I were talking and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>just talking about kids getting involved</v>

549
00:22:44.121 --> 00:22:47.330
<v Speaker 2>in martial arts and kids getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in sports.</v>

550
00:22:47.331 --> 00:22:50.930
<v Speaker 2>And he was talking about like what he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like when he was young that,</v>

551
00:22:50.931 --> 00:22:53.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's trying to like teach kids,</v>

552
00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:55.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about controlling themselves,</v>

553
00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:57.020
<v Speaker 2>keep teach kids about keeping their shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

554
00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:00.530
<v Speaker 2>And this was right after that dude that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the football player,</v>

555
00:23:00.531 --> 00:23:05.531
<v Speaker 2>but he was chasing after his girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He jumped in the back of a truck and he </v>

556
00:23:05.531 --> 00:23:05.531
<v Speaker 2>fell out and died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that.</v>

557
00:23:05.531 --> 00:23:06.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the guy's name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

558
00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:08.970
<v Speaker 2>he was talking about that guy that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy that,</v>

559
00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:14.380
<v Speaker 2>that was not thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just reacting like you don't </v>

560
00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:14.380
<v Speaker 2>think you don't do shit like that when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking,</v>

561
00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:17.750
<v Speaker 2>but these guys aren't thinking they just</v>
<v Speaker 2>react and that he's trying to teach them</v>

562
00:23:17.751 --> 00:23:22.150
<v Speaker 2>how to like put some steps in there to </v>
<v Speaker 2>like consider things before you act and,</v>

563
00:23:22.151 --> 00:23:27.151
<v Speaker 2>and recognize that there's a reason why </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are so quick to behave like that and</v>

564
00:23:27.411 --> 00:23:32.411
<v Speaker 2>that these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these reckless type people are the ones </v>

565
00:23:32.411 --> 00:23:35.051
<v Speaker 2>who are always involved in like really </v>
<v Speaker 2>strong competitive athletics like </v>

566
00:23:35.051 --> 00:23:35.950
<v Speaker 2>fighting and men football and shit like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because they're,</v>

567
00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:40.960
<v Speaker 2>they're so much more quick to react.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much more explosive that a </v>

568
00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.531
<v Speaker 2>lot of it is just stress based me to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many fighters are born from shitty </v>

569
00:23:44.531 --> 00:23:45.530
<v Speaker 2>households.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many.</v>

570
00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:48.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's somehow a prerequisite.</v>

571
00:23:48.471 --> 00:23:53.471
<v Speaker 1>There's guys from strong families that </v>
<v Speaker 1>still are great fighters because they </v>

572
00:23:53.471 --> 00:23:53.471
<v Speaker 1>just accept that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

573
00:23:53.471 --> 00:23:58.240
<v Speaker 1>they just love the challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like George St Pierre is a perfect </v>

574
00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:58.240
<v Speaker 1>example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very close with his dad,</v>

575
00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.050
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of guys come from fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>broken homes,</v>

576
00:24:00.051 --> 00:24:01.300
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a,</v>

577
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:03.230
<v Speaker 1>there's something in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something in that.</v>

578
00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:08.290
<v Speaker 1>The fury is just a little more intense </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a dude who grows up without a dad </v>

579
00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:10.280
<v Speaker 1>or dude to grows up in like a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty situation.</v>

580
00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.760
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking crazy,</v>

581
00:24:13.761 --> 00:24:18.761
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he really stopped to think about </v>

582
00:24:18.761 --> 00:24:18.761
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy that anybody would want their</v>

583
00:24:18.761 --> 00:24:20.390
<v Speaker 1>kid to be famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Lindsay Lohan thing,</v>

584
00:24:20.391 --> 00:24:22.700
<v Speaker 1>this should be the last draw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

585
00:24:22.701 --> 00:24:24.980
<v Speaker 1>there shouldn't be some condo laws about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

586
00:24:24.981 --> 00:24:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think most of the people that have</v>

587
00:24:27.381 --> 00:24:28.920
<v Speaker 1>their kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because they're,</v>

588
00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:30.920
<v Speaker 1>they're broken dreams and they're using </v>
<v Speaker 1>their kids,</v>

589
00:24:30.921 --> 00:24:31.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

590
00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just a lack of awareness there.</v>

591
00:24:33.921 --> 00:24:35.420
<v Speaker 1>Lack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lack of real,</v>

592
00:24:35.421 --> 00:24:36.800
<v Speaker 1>real consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see?</v>

593
00:24:36.801 --> 00:24:38.870
<v Speaker 1>Nobody thinks it's an offensive thing.</v>

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:27.910
<v Speaker 4>You are so precious to me and my </v>
<v Speaker 4>precious to you.</v>

694
00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.540
<v Speaker 4>The answer Brian is yes.</v>

695
00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:39.860
<v Speaker 1>That was so pointless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I missed the very beginning of it,</v>

696
00:28:39.861 --> 00:28:43.410
<v Speaker 1>but still he didn't have his rapping </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean it had some of his lyrics.</v>

697
00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.840
<v Speaker 1>I think that they're just saying that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a rapper,</v>

698
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:50.870
<v Speaker 1>but it was whack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can't play it because they don't </v>

699
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.870
<v Speaker 1>have to pay him or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

700
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that [inaudible] that was</v>

701
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:51.230
<v Speaker 1>on vh one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

702
00:28:51.231 --> 00:28:56.231
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were also saying that he's wack </v>

703
00:28:56.231 --> 00:28:56.790
<v Speaker 1>mean they quoted his lyrics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty wack.</v>

704
00:28:57.130 --> 00:29:02.130
<v Speaker 1>It sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just like those lyrics were so </v>

705
00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:05.601
<v Speaker 1>whack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't even have to pass a </v>

706
00:29:05.601 --> 00:29:07.281
<v Speaker 1>judgment on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just playing for people and raise </v>

00:29:07.281 --> 00:29:09.501
<v Speaker 1>your eyebrows and go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it gives you that movie with Jesus </v>

711

<v Speaker 1>They just showed you these nutty </v>

712

<v Speaker 1>people are so nutty that they'll approve</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

715
00:29:25.981 --> 00:29:27.820
<v Speaker 1>You could show them the fucking video </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they would,</v>

716
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:28.560
<v Speaker 1>they would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would say,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>

<v Speaker 1>taking little kids and the best part is </v>

722
00:29:39.231 --> 00:29:41.290
<v Speaker 1>when they make them talk in tongues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that part?</v>

723
00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:43.840

<v Speaker 2>So the kids would go Sharmila,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mola,</v>

728
00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:54.370
<v Speaker 2>tongues?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious.</v>

729
00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:55.650
<v Speaker 2>They're five years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

730
00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.010
<v Speaker 2>five years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nonsense.</v>

731
00:29:57.011 --> 00:29:58.960
<v Speaker 2>They love nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five years old.</v>

732
00:29:58.961 --> 00:30:00.130
<v Speaker 2>Love to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonsense.</v>

733
00:30:00.131 --> 00:30:05.131
<v Speaker 2>All five-year-old kids do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you give them like a time of the day </v>

734
00:30:05.131 --> 00:30:05.131
<v Speaker 2>at school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our kids time to go.</v>

735
00:30:05.131 --> 00:30:09.961
<v Speaker 2>Nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they just go through fantasy and they</v>

736
00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:12.820
<v Speaker 2>tuck it in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This made up language and it's obviously</v>

737
00:30:12.821 --> 00:30:16.300
<v Speaker 2>not a fucking language because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not saying anything.</v>

738
00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:18.670
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell when I'm listening to someone</v>

739
00:30:18.671 --> 00:30:20.440
<v Speaker 2>talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if they have a foreign language,</v>

740
00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:22.600
<v Speaker 2>I can tell if it's a real language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

741
00:30:22.601 --> 00:30:25.240
<v Speaker 2>you hear someone talking in like in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chinese,</v>

742
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:27.100
<v Speaker 2>like they're saying a bunch of crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

743
00:30:27.101 --> 00:30:29.410
<v Speaker 2>but there is a flow to it where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

744
00:30:29.411 --> 00:30:32.680
<v Speaker 2>they're not seeing the same sounds over </v>
<v Speaker 2>and over and over and over again.</v>

745
00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:36.280
<v Speaker 2>Which is what you do because you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>invent all these sounds on the fly.</v>

746
00:30:36.281 --> 00:30:41.281
<v Speaker 2>If you're making a fake language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to have them very to the point </v>

747
00:30:41.281 --> 00:30:43.840
<v Speaker 2>where it looks like it's like an actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>like language that's difficult.</v>

748
00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:48.730
<v Speaker 2>So you start going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what they all do.</v>

749
00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:53.760
<v Speaker 2>They're all uncreative fucks and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking in tongues and they're just </v>

750
00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:54.400
<v Speaker 2>making nonsense noises.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all they're doing,</v>

751
00:30:54.401 --> 00:30:59.401
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're getting little kids to do </v>

752
00:30:59.401 --> 00:30:59.401
<v Speaker 2>this shit and they're telling these kids</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

753
00:30:59.401 --> 00:30:59.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know your,</v>

754
00:30:59.401 --> 00:31:01.330
<v Speaker 2>your warriors for Christ and there this </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman,</v>

755
00:31:01.331 --> 00:31:06.331
<v Speaker 2>it was comparing them to how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know Hamas and all these terrorist </v>

756
00:31:06.331 --> 00:31:08.290
<v Speaker 2>organizations raised little jihadists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was literally comparing them.</v>

757
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:11.170
<v Speaker 2>She's comparing them like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't we do that with Christianity?</v>

758
00:31:11.171 --> 00:31:16.171
<v Speaker 2>Like this would be a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason why these people are willing </v>

759
00:31:16.171 --> 00:31:16.171
<v Speaker 2>to blow themselves up.</v>

760
00:31:16.171 --> 00:31:17.110
<v Speaker 2>It's because they indoctrinated them </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the world of radical Islam.</v>

761
00:31:17.111 --> 00:31:19.080
<v Speaker 2>We can do the same thing but for good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

762
00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:21.100
<v Speaker 2>but we're good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not seeing the.</v>

763
00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:22.420
<v Speaker 2>The irony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

764
00:31:22.421 --> 00:31:24.560
<v Speaker 2>in the brainwashing kids she's talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

765
00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:29.670
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're getting brainwashed with the </v>

766
00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:31.231
<v Speaker 2>wrong thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if we brainwash our kids with the </v>

767
00:31:31.231 --> 00:31:31.231
<v Speaker 2>truth and Jesus and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

768
00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:37.070
<v Speaker 2>Jerell how to raise kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had two guys a knock on my door today </v>

769

<v Speaker 2>white shirts and the ties and stuff like</v>

770
00:31:39.731 --> 00:31:41.650
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a scientology or a mormon?</v>

771
00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.820
<v Speaker 2>That's a more memory more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It might be but are so nice.</v>

774
00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:51.740
<v Speaker 2>I can't stop laughing at them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

775
00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:54.550
<v Speaker 2>It's just ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's completely ridiculous.</v>

776
00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:57.610
<v Speaker 2>The whole look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all ridiculous though.</v>

777
00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.000
<v Speaker 2>It's not that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

778
00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:04.350
<v Speaker 2>being a Muslim isn't ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but being a Jew is everything's </v>

779
00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:05.250
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being a Catholics,</v>

780
00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:06.710
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being a president,</v>

781
00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:07.780
<v Speaker 2>Protestants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous.</v>

782
00:32:07.781 --> 00:32:10.360
<v Speaker 2>Being a baptist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being a Buddhist is ridiculous.</v>

783
00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:15.510
<v Speaker 2>Being an anything is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a fucking human being and if you </v>

784
00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:16.750
<v Speaker 2>attach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you attach yourself and your mind to any</v>

785
00:32:16.751 --> 00:32:21.751
<v Speaker 2>ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be on a road and that </v>

786
00:32:21.751 --> 00:32:22.600
<v Speaker 2>road may or may not lead you in a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction,</v>

787
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:24.760
<v Speaker 2>but you're going to stay on that fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>road.</v>

788
00:32:24.761 --> 00:32:27.760
<v Speaker 2>If you're attached to an ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it could be a terrible road,</v>

789
00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:31.030
<v Speaker 2>it could be a road of circumcising,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your daughter's cliteracy because that's</v>

790
00:32:31.031 --> 00:32:36.031
<v Speaker 2>a fucking tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean these fucking crazy bitches in </v>

791
00:32:36.031 --> 00:32:37.480
<v Speaker 2>Africa that cut holes in their lip and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stretch them out to put plates on.</v>

792
00:32:37.481 --> 00:32:42.481
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they got on a fucking road and </v>

793
00:32:42.481 --> 00:32:44.801
<v Speaker 2>they stick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They stuck with that road regardless of </v>

794
00:32:44.801 --> 00:32:44.801
<v Speaker 2>rational thinking.</v>

795
00:32:44.801 --> 00:32:44.801
<v Speaker 2>They didn't use rational thinking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

796
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:49.930
<v Speaker 2>They're just adapted a predetermined </v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern or behavior that makes life so </v>

797
00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:51.050
<v Speaker 2>much more simple and that's what every </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking religion is.</v>

798
00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:53.720
<v Speaker 2>The problem is no one knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cannot.</v>

799
00:32:53.721 --> 00:32:55.850
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can have your own beautiful personal</v>

800
00:32:55.851 --> 00:33:00.851
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could have been the person that was </v>

801
00:33:00.851 --> 00:33:02.471
<v Speaker 2>actually touched by God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you start yelling and ranting </v>

802
00:33:02.471 --> 00:33:05.741
<v Speaker 2>that other people have to follow your </v>
<v Speaker 2>lead or the fucking world's gonna end </v>

803
00:33:05.741 --> 00:33:07.370
<v Speaker 2>and Christian is going to be taken away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you're full of shit.</v>

804
00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:09.830
<v Speaker 2>I know you're full of Shit and you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're full of shit.</v>

805
00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:14.980
<v Speaker 2>And the real problem is that we can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>say it because everybody's got this </v>

806
00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:14.980
<v Speaker 2>freedom of religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom of religion,</v>

807
00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:17.000
<v Speaker 2>religious freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the freedom to express yourself.</v>

808
00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:19.400
<v Speaker 2>Even if you're expressing yourself with </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonsense.</v>

809
00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.680
<v Speaker 2>Nonsense that helps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scared,</v>

810
00:33:21.681 --> 00:33:22.790
<v Speaker 2>lonely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sad.</v>

811
00:33:22.791 --> 00:33:26.330
<v Speaker 2>People lock onto that nonsense so they </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel like they're a part of something.</v>

812
00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is.</v>

813
00:33:27.381 --> 00:33:29.510
<v Speaker 2>It preys on people whose lives fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>suck.</v>

814
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:33.460
<v Speaker 2>So it's all nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like your shit's cool and my,</v>

<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

818
00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:42.620
<v Speaker 2>there's just questions and until we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>honest about that,</v>

819
00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:47.740
<v Speaker 2>we're never going to evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The human race is stuck in a giant </v>

820
00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:51.110
<v Speaker 2>quagmire when it comes to our behavior </v>
<v Speaker 2>and our thinking about our behavior.</v>

821
00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:52.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally.</v>

822
00:33:52.221 --> 00:33:54.560

<v Speaker 2>and one thing is like they all look like</v>

<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine though if they mixed it </v>
<v Speaker 2>up and like showed up with like,</v>

827
00:34:06.641 --> 00:34:10.530
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be if the Mormons came to </v>

828
00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:10.530
<v Speaker 1>your house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just started rocking it.</v>

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

833
00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:19.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the world's ready for like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hip religion yet.</v>

834
00:34:19.450 --> 00:34:22.450
<v Speaker 1>There was some work that we're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with rock and roll churches.</v>

835
00:34:22.451 --> 00:34:23.160
<v Speaker 1>Remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Really popular.</v>

838
00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:31.680
<v Speaker 1>My name is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a girl that used to work at </v>

839
00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:31.990
<v Speaker 1>fear factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a very nice girl and she uh,</v>

840
00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:32.710
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

841
00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:37.740
<v Speaker 1>trying to fireplace and she started </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to a rock and roll church saying </v>

842
00:34:39.131 --> 00:34:44.131
<v Speaker 1>how much I would really love this rock </v>
<v Speaker 1>and roll church could even though this </v>

843
00:34:44.131 --> 00:34:47.410
<v Speaker 1>guy's talking about God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's really all just about being </v>

844
00:34:47.410 --> 00:34:49.771
<v Speaker 1>positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the vehicle that he uses for </v>

845
00:34:49.771 --> 00:34:49.771
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

846
00:34:49.771 --> 00:34:54.340
<v Speaker 1>religion can give you some inspiration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there comes a certain point in time </v>

847
00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:58.381
<v Speaker 1>where you have to pop the training </v>
<v Speaker 1>wheels off and you have to recognize </v>

848
00:34:58.381 --> 00:35:01.171
<v Speaker 1>that all this mortality that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed is good because it's good to </v>

849
00:35:01.171 --> 00:35:01.171
<v Speaker 1>treat other people good.</v>

850
00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:04.360
<v Speaker 1>It's good to treat other people the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>you would like to be treated yourself.</v>

851
00:35:04.361 --> 00:35:06.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like a fucking golden rule and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason for it,</v>

852
00:35:06.791 --> 00:35:11.791
<v Speaker 1>and that reason is that we're connected </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some strange way that we don't </v>

853
00:35:11.791 --> 00:35:15.211
<v Speaker 1>totally understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you are good to other people </v>

854
00:35:15.211 --> 00:35:18.121
<v Speaker 1>around you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you were kind and friendly and </v>

855
00:35:18.121 --> 00:35:20.641
<v Speaker 1>warm and loving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going fucking enjoy this </v>

856
00:35:20.641 --> 00:35:20.641
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just not.</v>

857
00:35:20.641 --> 00:35:21.910
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be problems everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>you go.</v>

858
00:35:21.911 --> 00:35:23.620
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have problems everywhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go.</v>

859
00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:25.930
<v Speaker 1>You got to figure out a way to enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 1>this fucking life.</v>

860
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:29.320
<v Speaker 1>It's not because of Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not because of Moses.</v>

861
00:35:29.321 --> 00:35:32.200
<v Speaker 1>It's not because of anybody that may or </v>
<v Speaker 1>may not have ever existed.</v>

862
00:35:32.201 --> 00:35:34.480
<v Speaker 1>It's because that's how you fit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>better in the world.</v>

863
00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:39.660
<v Speaker 1>That's how you stay positive and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have to some shit that was </v>

864
00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:39.660
<v Speaker 1>written</v>

865
00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:41.130
<v Speaker 2>5,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago and fucking animal skins.</v>

866
00:35:41.131 --> 00:35:43.590
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't have to be the golden rule </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's old,</v>

867
00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:44.520
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's dumb.</v>

868
00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:47.040
<v Speaker 2>We need to figure out like now,</v>

<v Speaker 2>energy.</v>

872
00:35:55.581 --> 00:35:56.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know objective Lee,</v>

873
00:35:56.551 --> 00:36:01.551
<v Speaker 2>what's causing pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know objective really what's causing </v>

874
00:36:01.551 --> 00:36:05.000
<v Speaker 2>birth defects and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're taking it too much chemicals </v>

875
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:05.370
<v Speaker 2>and not enough vitamins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know objective,</v>

876
00:36:05.371 --> 00:36:10.371
<v Speaker 2>we all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know how to organize our world and </v>

877
00:36:10.371 --> 00:36:13.521
<v Speaker 2>yet we don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know how to organize our health and </v>

878
00:36:13.521 --> 00:36:13.521
<v Speaker 2>yet very few people do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know all these things.</v>

879
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:16.920
<v Speaker 2>The right path to like being like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy,</v>

880
00:36:16.921 --> 00:36:21.921
<v Speaker 2>healthy person is to do all the shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we already know you're supposed to </v>

881
00:36:21.921 --> 00:36:21.921
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

882
00:36:21.921 --> 00:36:23.040
<v Speaker 2>Take care of your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take care of your health,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Meditate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be kind to people.</v>

885
00:36:26.371 --> 00:36:27.630
<v Speaker 2>We all know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

886
00:36:27.631 --> 00:36:32.631
<v Speaker 2>you ask anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know how to get by and to be the </v>

887
00:36:32.631 --> 00:36:33.450
<v Speaker 2>the most evolved version of you that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be.</v>

888
00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like a magical checklist.</v>

889
00:36:35.821 --> 00:36:37.080
<v Speaker 2>If you talked to people about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said,</v>

890
00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:38.670
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here you got a person.</v>

<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I was a life coach,</v>

894
00:36:43.671 --> 00:36:47.931
<v Speaker 2>the first thing I would say is this </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy's got to get on a diet that makes </v>

895
00:36:47.931 --> 00:36:47.931
<v Speaker 2>them healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean to die just to lose weight.</v>

896
00:36:47.931 --> 00:36:50.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean just healthy foods in your body.</v>

901
00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:05.010
<v Speaker 2>better sense of like how this machine </v>
<v Speaker 2>feels.</v>

902
00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:07.650
<v Speaker 2>When it's moving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's flowing better.</v>

903
00:37:07.651 --> 00:37:12.651
<v Speaker 2>There's less tension in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your mind feels like relaxed and you </v>

904
00:37:12.651 --> 00:37:13.680
<v Speaker 2>enjoy every single moment of the day </v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:52.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean everybody makes their own path </v>
<v Speaker 2>through this world,</v>

924
00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:58.310
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people don't follow the </v>
<v Speaker 2>path that they really fucking feel </v>

925
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:59.100
<v Speaker 2>pulled to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

926
00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:04.380
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got negative programming and then </v>

927
00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:04.380
<v Speaker 2>when they were kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone told them they couldn't do it or</v>

928
00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:06.690
<v Speaker 2>told them to take the shortcut or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or take the,</v>

929
00:38:06.691 --> 00:38:07.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

930
00:38:07.081 --> 00:38:09.810
<v Speaker 2>the shorter route.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a sad thing,</v>

931
00:38:09.811 --> 00:38:10.860
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he talked to dudes,</v>

932
00:38:10.861 --> 00:38:15.861
<v Speaker 2>especially like talented dudes and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't follow up with what they want to </v>

933
00:38:15.861 --> 00:38:15.861
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

934
00:38:15.861 --> 00:38:16.440
<v Speaker 2>nobody like that.</v>

935
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:22.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was just thinking to your list </v>

936
00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:23.981
<v Speaker 3>that I think you should never stop </v>
<v Speaker 3>tickling people and I don't know why </v>

937
00:38:23.981 --> 00:38:26.450
<v Speaker 3>it's looked down upon because I enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 3>making people laugh,</v>

938
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:28.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including tickling,</v>

939
00:38:28.611 --> 00:38:30.790
<v Speaker 3>forcing them to laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like people to him.</v>

940
00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:35.490
<v Speaker 3>Why are you ticklish ticklish where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>tickle tickle,</v>

941
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:36.010
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you</v>

942
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:37.710
<v Speaker 1>know where ticklish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an interesting subject.</v>

943
00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:41.230
<v Speaker 1>You know where this comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an evolutionary trait and it's from</v>

944
00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:46.770
<v Speaker 1>being freaked out instantly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately about spiders and insects </v>

945
00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:48.820
<v Speaker 1>crawling on you because if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeping on the ground,</v>

946
00:38:48.821 --> 00:38:50.470
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you're sleeping on the ground</v>

947
00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:52.810
<v Speaker 1>and some things on you and you fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>move like that,</v>

948
00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:53.920
<v Speaker 1>that's what ticklish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

949
00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:57.760
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to avoid these instant </v>
<v Speaker 1>reactions to these weird sensitive areas</v>

950
00:38:57.761 --> 00:38:59.680
<v Speaker 1>or body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially things where things can crawl</v>

951
00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.710
<v Speaker 1>like under your armpits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You touched my armpit.</v>

952
00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:04.510
<v Speaker 1>I'll jump through the fucking roof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've fuck it,</v>

953
00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:06.190
<v Speaker 1>but that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

954
00:39:06.191 --> 00:39:09.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like this is all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an evolutionary thing.</v>

955
00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.960
<v Speaker 1>It did not know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

956
00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why else would you have this extreme </v>

957
00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:16.480
<v Speaker 1>reaction on the bottom of your feet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where you're stepping on things.</v>

958
00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:18.090
<v Speaker 1>Not Ticklish at all though.</v>

959
00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:23.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's topes and they're </v>

960
00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:23.090
<v Speaker 1>supposed to die because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

961
00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:25.630
<v Speaker 1>I dated this girl that I even went to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the unit that she was willing to date </v>

962
00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:28.470
<v Speaker 1>you so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a b.</v>

964
00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:34.460

<v Speaker 1>I always go for the Butler was the last </v>

965
00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:37.921
<v Speaker 1>move though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you're not tick less of your </v>

966

<v Speaker 1>usually gets them.</v>

967
00:39:37.921 --> 00:39:39.460
<v Speaker 1>You ever watch a porno where a girl's </v>
<v Speaker 1>got a rubber butthole and you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:46.780
<v Speaker 1>but I'm seeing the Bella,</v>

00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:48.860
<v Speaker 1>awesome CGI,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1152
00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:48.960
<v Speaker 1>use the quick for engine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1153
00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:52.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once it gets to the point where um,</v>

1154
00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:57.960
<v Speaker 1>pornography can be artificially created,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it'd be way better.</v>

1155
00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:03.060
<v Speaker 1>It was Karma Free Porn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today's a day that doc set the time </v>

1156
00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:04.020
<v Speaker 1>machine to go back to and back to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

1157
00:47:04.021 --> 00:47:04.800
<v Speaker 1>But really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1158
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:06.120
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

1159
00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:09.000
<v Speaker 1>How do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody tweeted it earlier today.</v>

1160
00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:11.190
<v Speaker 1>I didn't research it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it might be fake.</v>

1161
00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:13.920
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if they really do </v>
<v Speaker 1>invent a time machine one day?</v>

1162
00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Because the real thing about time </v>
<v Speaker 1>machines that people aren't aware of,</v>

1163
00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:20.790
<v Speaker 1>there's scientists that actually tried </v>
<v Speaker 1>to like study time travel and whether or</v>

1164
00:47:20.791 --> 00:47:22.860
<v Speaker 1>not there's a guy's fucking awesome </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

1165
00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:27.240
<v Speaker 1>His name is Ronald Malate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Ronald Mouth,</v>

1166
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:29.970
<v Speaker 1>I believe from Connecticut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if you google that shit.</v>

1167
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:31.420
<v Speaker 2>See if that's his name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

1168
00:47:31.421 --> 00:47:33.270
<v Speaker 2>the guy has a fantastic story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

1169
00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:38.300
<v Speaker 2>he's like the leading scientists when it</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes to a theoretical models for time </v>

1170
00:47:40.361 --> 00:47:41.080
<v Speaker 2>trap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was his name?</v>

1171
00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:46.030
<v Speaker 2>Ronald Malate from I believe University </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Connecticut and he.</v>

1172
00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:49.330
<v Speaker 2>He has like a working model yet is </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ronald Mallon.</v>

1173
00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:52.420
<v Speaker 2>He has a working model of a m,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a l,</v>

1174
00:47:52.421 --> 00:47:53.760
<v Speaker 2>l e t,</v>
<v Speaker 2>t or one,</v>

1175
00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:55.570
<v Speaker 2>one tier two t's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tt.</v>

1176
00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:57.940
<v Speaker 2>Who else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>M a l l e t,</v>

1177
00:47:57.941 --> 00:48:00.280
<v Speaker 2>t look him up on Google and there's some</v>
<v Speaker 2>videos about him,</v>

1178
00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:03.250
<v Speaker 2>but his dad died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a crazy story.</v>

1179
00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:08.440
<v Speaker 2>His Dad died when he was a kid and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was so hurt.</v>

1180
00:48:08.441 --> 00:48:11.260
<v Speaker 2>He loved his father and his whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his photos of him and his father and his</v>

1181
00:48:11.261 --> 00:48:14.710
<v Speaker 2>father smile and he smiled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was so close to his father.</v>

1182
00:48:14.711 --> 00:48:19.711
<v Speaker 2>When his father died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it crushed him and so he dedicated his </v>

1183
00:48:19.711 --> 00:48:21.070
<v Speaker 2>life to creating a time machine.</v>

1184
00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:25.210
<v Speaker 2>He dedicated his life to creating a time</v>
<v Speaker 2>machine so that he could go back in time</v>

1185
00:48:25.211 --> 00:48:28.750
<v Speaker 2>and save his father so his father would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be with him again.</v>

1186
00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:33.900
<v Speaker 2>So that was the entire focus of his life</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he got to a certain point where he </v>

1187
00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:37.270
<v Speaker 2>realized that you can someday it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible to travel back in time,</v>

1188
00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:42.810
<v Speaker 2>but it's not something that you're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be able to go back to any point in </v>

1189
00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:47.671
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're only going to be able to go back </v>

1190
00:48:47.671 --> 00:48:47.671
<v Speaker 2>in time to the moment that the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>time machine was invented.</v>

1191
00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:51.850
<v Speaker 2>So what we'll be able to be possible is </v>
<v Speaker 2>you will be able to.</v>

1192
00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:54.190
<v Speaker 2>The moment there is a time machine </v>
<v Speaker 2>invented,</v>

1193
00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:56.290
<v Speaker 2>you'll that day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From that day on,</v>

1194
00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:58.450
<v Speaker 2>you'll be able to go to any point in </v>
<v Speaker 2>history that you want.</v>

1195
00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:00.220
<v Speaker 2>So you can go to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1196
00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:02.860
<v Speaker 2>assuming there's human beings around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1197
00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:06.250
<v Speaker 2>assuming the world hasn't been hit by </v>
<v Speaker 2>another planet or some crazy shit,</v>

1198
00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:09.340
<v Speaker 2>you'll be able to go to 1 million years </v>
<v Speaker 2>from now.</v>

1199
00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:11.380
<v Speaker 2>Let's see what the world looks like 1 </v>
<v Speaker 2>million years from now.</v>

1200
00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:14.530
<v Speaker 2>Because there will be time machines </v>
<v Speaker 2>functional back then or in that feature.</v>

1201
00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:17.530
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the,</v>

1202
00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:22.770
<v Speaker 2>this is all theoretical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is that any moment in </v>

1203
00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:25.330
<v Speaker 2>time could also go back to the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first time she was invented.</v>

1204
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:28.990
<v Speaker 2>So if you can travel back in time from </v>
<v Speaker 2>any moment in time,</v>

1205
00:49:28.991 --> 00:49:31.360
<v Speaker 2>that's like millions of years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

1206
00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:33.430
<v Speaker 2>infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If people are still alive,</v>

1207
00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:38.490
<v Speaker 2>have of time of years of people going </v>
<v Speaker 2>back to the moment of the first time </v>

1208
00:49:38.490 --> 00:49:42.121
<v Speaker 2>machine being invented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's literally like the whole notion </v>

1209
00:49:42.121 --> 00:49:43.870
<v Speaker 2>of time gets broken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1210
00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:45.880
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no real future.</v>

1211
00:49:45.881 --> 00:49:50.881
<v Speaker 2>It all kind of happens all at once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So literally fucks with the entire </v>

1212
00:49:50.881 --> 00:49:55.471
<v Speaker 2>fabric of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything can come back to the moment </v>

1213
00:49:55.471 --> 00:49:55.471
<v Speaker 2>that the first time machine was </v>
<v Speaker 2>invented.</v>

1214
00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:58.360
<v Speaker 2>It like breaks everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is like real shit.</v>

1215
00:49:58.361 --> 00:50:03.361
<v Speaker 2>They're working on like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy is like really convinced that </v>

1216
00:50:03.361 --> 00:50:03.430
<v Speaker 2>this is a possible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's craziness.</v>

1217
00:50:04.850 --> 00:50:06.800
<v Speaker 3>Here's something else I had back to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future three.</v>

1218
00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:11.860
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the very end of the movie</v>
<v Speaker 3>when dox has his kids and he's like </v>

1219
00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:12.980
<v Speaker 3>telling like cmit everything's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be good,</v>

1220
00:50:12.981 --> 00:50:14.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at one of the kids,</v>

1221
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:19.870
<v Speaker 3>the kids starts going like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like come here or put something in my </v>

1222
00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:21.980
<v Speaker 3>hand and then he points to his dick what</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

1223
00:50:21.981 --> 00:50:25.580
<v Speaker 3>So ridiculous and just got snuck through</v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow it snuck through.</v>

1224
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:27.970
<v Speaker 3>But I'm talking about like a six old to</v>

1225
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.830
<v Speaker 1>people were so stupid back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even know.</v>

1226
00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:32.930
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could find on youtube,</v>

1227
00:50:32.931 --> 00:50:35.990
<v Speaker 1>like back to the future three points to </v>
<v Speaker 1>package.</v>

1228
00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Is that one of those movies that you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch it today and it would disappoint </v>

1229
00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:41.300
<v Speaker 1>the shit out of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1230
00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:41.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not so good.</v>

1231
00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:44.540
<v Speaker 1>Not so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I saw the first one the other day</v>

1232
00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:47.810
<v Speaker 1>and it was okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I saw the third one was just so</v>

1233
00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:49.500
<v Speaker 1>dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even want to watch it.</v>

1234
00:50:49.590 --> 00:50:50.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1235
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:53.450
<v Speaker 1>the evolution of movies has been pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking pretty obvious.</v>

1236
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:56.660
<v Speaker 1>The evolution of what we accept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1237
00:50:56.750 --> 00:51:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people talk about avatar being </v>

1238
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:02.840
<v Speaker 1>silly and ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still you see toy story three yet?</v>

1239
00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:04.010
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard it's awesome,</v>

1240
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:06.860
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are the best.</v>

1241
00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:09.410
<v Speaker 1>All that animation stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which just freaks me the fuck out.</v>

1242
00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:14.440
<v Speaker 1>I was reading and wired there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some insane amount of time for </v>

1243
00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:16.460
<v Speaker 1>like every frame for as far as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1244
00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:21.320
<v Speaker 1>rendering something like seven our </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking time for each frame to render.</v>

1245
00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:23.720
<v Speaker 1>Is that insane?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which movie though?</v>

1246
00:51:23.721 --> 00:51:25.700
<v Speaker 1>This campaign now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1247
00:51:25.701 --> 00:51:26.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1248
00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:32.700
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems like it would be better than </v>

1249
00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:33.830
<v Speaker 1>I could go into the living room and go </v>
<v Speaker 1>get that a,</v>

1250
00:51:34.290 --> 00:51:36.300
<v Speaker 2>that magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know exactly where it is and</v>

1251
00:51:36.301 --> 00:51:40.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to get up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the idea is that it's still,</v>

1252
00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:44.370
<v Speaker 2>even to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult to do the whole,</v>

1253
00:51:44.371 --> 00:51:46.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if my timeframe is wrong,</v>

1254
00:51:46.590 --> 00:51:51.590
<v Speaker 2>the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you just go look under wired </v>

1255
00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:53.430
<v Speaker 2>pixar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pixar,</v>

1256
00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:55.740
<v Speaker 2>not pixel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1257
00:51:57.420 --> 00:52:00.600
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still not quite there yet as far as</v>

1258
00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:05.610
<v Speaker 2>like the technology that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>exist one day where you can create </v>

1259
00:52:05.610 --> 00:52:07.130
<v Speaker 2>instant artificial people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1260
00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:12.140
<v Speaker 2>you remember like the editing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing right now just with final </v>

1261
00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:14.190
<v Speaker 2>cut on just doing on a regular home </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer.</v>

1262
00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:19.210
<v Speaker 2>An apple mean that this is the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit that 10 years ago it was like </v>

1263
00:52:19.210 --> 00:52:21.810
<v Speaker 2>fucking dreaming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're dreaming bitch.</v>

1264
00:52:21.811 --> 00:52:25.530
<v Speaker 2>Like you're gonna what you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to edit and how fast is it gonna</v>

1265
00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:28.290
<v Speaker 2>render we're going to put shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that easy.</v>

1266
00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:29.940
<v Speaker 2>Twenty years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Science fiction,</v>

1267
00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:31.470
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty years ago,</v>

1268
00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:33.240
<v Speaker 2>science fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 years ago,</v>

1269
00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:35.570
<v Speaker 2>super crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Science fiction.</v>

1270
00:52:35.571 --> 00:52:37.520
<v Speaker 2>It's like ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking,</v>

1271
00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:42.560
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about something that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like people would look at in the </v>

1272
00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:42.560
<v Speaker 2>movies and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1273
00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:44.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like minority report type shit.</v>

1274
00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:49.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they make it look like you can do </v>

1275
00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:50.391
<v Speaker 1>it now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it really is not going to exist for </v>

1276
00:52:50.391 --> 00:52:50.391
<v Speaker 1>another 100 years or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you say?</v>

1277
00:52:50.391 --> 00:52:51.330
<v Speaker 1>How many hours?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they said seven.</v>

1278
00:52:51.331 --> 00:52:51.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they.</v>

1279
00:52:51.961 --> 00:52:53.520
<v Speaker 1>Just seven hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven hours.</v>

1280
00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:55.830
<v Speaker 1>Seven hours per pixel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck,</v>

1281
00:52:55.831 --> 00:53:00.831
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all I got super computer to </v>

1282
00:53:00.831 --> 00:53:00.831
<v Speaker 1>write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was like A.</v>

1283
00:53:00.831 --> 00:53:00.831
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1284
00:53:00.831 --> 00:53:03.330
<v Speaker 1>a huge cloud of computers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>

1285
00:53:03.790 --> 00:53:06.390
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those movies took a lot of fucking time,</v>

1286
00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:08.250
<v Speaker 1>but God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're cool as fuck.</v>

1287
00:53:08.670 --> 00:53:12.150
<v Speaker 1>So 77 hours now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in 10 years,</v>

1288
00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:15.240
<v Speaker 1>that means we could do pixar movies on </v>
<v Speaker 1>her phone.</v>

1289
00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:17.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1290
00:53:17.191 --> 00:53:18.200
<v Speaker 1>That's inevitable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1291
00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:19.350
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey Dude,</v>

1292
00:53:19.351 --> 00:53:20.790
<v Speaker 1>check off toy story 80.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1293
00:53:20.850 --> 00:53:23.130
<v Speaker 1>If they don't break the universe before </v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

1294
00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:24.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1295
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:25.140
<v Speaker 1>That's my latest.</v>

1296
00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:30.570
<v Speaker 2>The human beings created the big bang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been talking about on that stage.</v>

1297
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:32.680
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's.</v>

1298
00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:34.590
<v Speaker 2>I think that's why the big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think 14,</v>

1299
00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:37.350
<v Speaker 2>14 billion years ago plus was the big </v>
<v Speaker 2>bang.</v>

1300
00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:42.650
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a lonely dude in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>basement and figured out a way to break </v>

1301
00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:45.621
<v Speaker 2>the universe and they had a switch and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to see what happened and </v>

1302
00:53:45.621 --> 00:53:45.621
<v Speaker 2>they clicked it and the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just want to.</v>

1303
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:50.120
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1304
00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:52.980
<v Speaker 2>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people get curious and we developed to a</v>

1305
00:53:52.981 --> 00:53:55.470
<v Speaker 2>certain point in time where we repeat </v>
<v Speaker 2>the process.</v>

1306
00:53:57.690 --> 00:53:59.460
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1307
00:53:59.461 --> 00:54:01.410
<v Speaker 2>nobody knows what the fuck created the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Big Bang,</v>

1308
00:54:01.411 --> 00:54:06.411
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you see scientists working on </v>

1309
00:54:06.411 --> 00:54:09.081
<v Speaker 2>shit like the large Hadron collider,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the large Hadron collider is this crazy </v>

1310
00:54:09.081 --> 00:54:13.791
<v Speaker 2>experiment that they're participating </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now in Europe where they've got </v>

1311
00:54:13.791 --> 00:54:17.331
<v Speaker 2>this 22 kilometer long machine and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>spins these,</v>

1312
00:54:17.371 --> 00:54:22.371
<v Speaker 2>Adam's around and collides them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just just slightly slower than the </v>

1313
00:54:22.371 --> 00:54:25.731
<v Speaker 2>speed of light and they're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>recreate a thing called the Higgs Boson </v>

1314
00:54:25.731 --> 00:54:29.601
<v Speaker 2>particle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they believe there's actually five </v>

1315
00:54:29.601 --> 00:54:30.780
<v Speaker 2>different higgs boson particles are </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out like what,</v>

1316
00:54:30.810 --> 00:54:35.810
<v Speaker 2>what existed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They call it the God particle for lack </v>

1317
00:54:35.810 --> 00:54:38.631
<v Speaker 2>of a better word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's what existed just a </v>

1318
00:54:38.631 --> 00:54:38.631
<v Speaker 2>millisecond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1319
00:54:38.631 --> 00:54:39.810
<v Speaker 2>a fraction of a millisecond evening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1320
00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:42.960
<v Speaker 2>right after the big bang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when they get that,</v>

1321
00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:48.020
<v Speaker 2>when they figured out how to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if they do recreate the Higgs Boson </v>

1322
00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:48.020
<v Speaker 2>and if they do really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1323
00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:49.020
<v Speaker 2>find out it's not just a theoretical </v>
<v Speaker 2>particle,</v>

1324
00:54:49.021 --> 00:54:49.620
<v Speaker 2>but it's real.</v>

1325
00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:51.420
<v Speaker 2>When they do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to stop there.</v>

1326
00:54:51.910 --> 00:54:53.400
<v Speaker 2>But I have stop there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're got to keep going.</v>

1327
00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:56.700
<v Speaker 2>They're going to the what's the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing this is they got 10,000</v>

1328
00:54:56.701 --> 00:55:01.701
<v Speaker 2>scientists working on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the biggest project in </v>

1329
00:55:01.701 --> 00:55:03.330
<v Speaker 2>scientific history and it has nothing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do with making our lives better.</v>

1330
00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:07.860
<v Speaker 2>Technology at one point in time was all </v>
<v Speaker 2>about making your life better.</v>

1331
00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:09.480
<v Speaker 2>Technology was about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1332
00:55:09.481 --> 00:55:14.481
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to get water and we don't want </v>

1333
00:55:14.481 --> 00:55:14.481
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1334
00:55:14.481 --> 00:55:17.150
<v Speaker 2>just have to drink it out of the river </v>
<v Speaker 2>every time we would need to get it and </v>

1335
00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:17.150
<v Speaker 2>bring it back to camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do we do?</v>

1336
00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:21.420
<v Speaker 2>We figured out how to make a jug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's technology technology today.</v>

1337
00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:26.660
<v Speaker 2>The Shit like the Higgs Boson particle </v>
<v Speaker 2>shaped like the large Hadron collider </v>

1338
00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:26.910
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like making time machines.</v>

1339
00:55:26.911 --> 00:55:30.180
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck are you doing?</v>

1340
00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:35.360
<v Speaker 2>You're not fixing the hole in the ground</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Gulf that's making the oil </v>

1341
00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:39.230
<v Speaker 2>polar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't they pull all the scientists </v>

1342
00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:39.230
<v Speaker 2>off everything and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1343
00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:40.140
<v Speaker 2>we got to fix this before the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>ocean gets poisoned.</v>

1344
00:55:40.141 --> 00:55:41.640
<v Speaker 2>I've always wondered why they don't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1345
00:55:41.641 --> 00:55:44.460
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so with cancer it's just like,</v>

1346
00:55:44.461 --> 00:55:49.461
<v Speaker 2>all right guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to take all the sciences </v>

1347
00:55:49.461 --> 00:55:50.150
<v Speaker 2>that wants to cancer one year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do it.</v>

1348
00:55:50.850 --> 00:55:55.850
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys aren't experts in their </v>

1349
00:55:55.850 --> 00:55:55.850
<v Speaker 2>fields.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously.</v>

1350
00:55:55.850 --> 00:55:55.850
<v Speaker 2>You mean I can't know everything about </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

1351
00:55:55.850 --> 00:55:57.060
<v Speaker 2>It's a silly concept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean what I'm saying,</v>

1352
00:55:57.061 --> 00:56:02.061
<v Speaker 2>but it would be great if they took all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the top scientists from all the </v>

1353
00:56:02.061 --> 00:56:06.381
<v Speaker 2>different disciplines that would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved and they immediately allocated </v>

1354
00:56:06.381 --> 00:56:08.370
<v Speaker 2>funds to get them to work on the project</v>
<v Speaker 2>instantly and just the government stuff.</v>

1355
00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:10.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm not in favor of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government stepping in,</v>

1356
00:56:10.111 --> 00:56:13.740
<v Speaker 2>but in this case I would say this is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a natural disaster.</v>

1357
00:56:13.741 --> 00:56:18.741
<v Speaker 2>This is a fucking catastrophic disaster </v>
<v Speaker 2>where apocalyptic disaster where they </v>

1358
00:56:18.741 --> 00:56:20.580
<v Speaker 2>need to step in and do something about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this immediately.</v>

1359
00:56:20.730 --> 00:56:24.040
<v Speaker 2>They need to like impose like almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a martial law type of a thing.</v>

1360
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:25.820
<v Speaker 1>Take over the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1361
00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:28.750
<v Speaker 1>but then again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's going to be good that's doing that</v>

1362
00:56:28.751 --> 00:56:30.760
<v Speaker 1>for the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government would have to involve the</v>

1363
00:56:30.761 --> 00:56:33.910
<v Speaker 1>private sector and the private sector </v>
<v Speaker 1>would try to make a lot of money from it</v>

1364
00:56:33.911 --> 00:56:36.190
<v Speaker 1>and would try to fuck people over and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be a big scandal.</v>

1365
00:56:36.191 --> 00:56:38.800
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like Halliburton and they'd find</v>
<v Speaker 1>out billions of dollars are missing from</v>

1366
00:56:38.801 --> 00:56:41.680
<v Speaker 1>the whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My fucking idea sucks.</v>

1367
00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:44.770
<v Speaker 1>You see that baby and China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was born with a second food.</v>

1368
00:56:44.771 --> 00:56:48.440
<v Speaker 1>I did and I didn't want to look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw it and I shut it off.</v>

1369
00:56:48.450 --> 00:56:50.000
<v Speaker 1>That shit depresses the fuck out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1370
00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:52.540
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's,</v>

1371
00:56:52.590 --> 00:56:55.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a second face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It kind of looks like,</v>

1372
00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:58.210
<v Speaker 1>what does that movie a Phantom of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opera or whatever,</v>

1373
00:56:58.510 --> 00:56:59.980
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1374
00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:03.730
<v Speaker 1>did you say there were gonna be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fix the kid or I'll do it.</v>

1375
00:57:03.730 --> 00:57:05.560
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really depresses the shit out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of me.</v>

1376
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:10.750
<v Speaker 1>Just like the one that I saw the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>day where there was a baby that was </v>

1377
00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:10.750
<v Speaker 1>born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a fish baby,</v>

1378
00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:14.970
<v Speaker 1>like skin had this very strange disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit so depressing to me,</v>

1381
00:57:21.930 --> 00:57:24.520
<v Speaker 1>it's due to birth defects because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemicals,</v>

1382
00:57:24.550 --> 00:57:26.680
<v Speaker 1>people that worked at factories and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1383
00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:31.710
<v Speaker 1>people that were given chemicals they </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't have been given while they </v>

1384
00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:31.710
<v Speaker 1>were pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Man,</v>

1385
00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:33.490
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China's a tricky place right now.</v>

1386
00:57:33.491 --> 00:57:38.491
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China has some of the most polluted </v>

1387
00:57:38.491 --> 00:57:40.201
<v Speaker 1>cities in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen the videos on that </v>

<v Speaker 1>there are dropping like our old </v>

1389

<v Speaker 1>computers and cell phones are all going </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Belushi pollution problems and there was</v>

1397

<v Speaker 1>So we have a photo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You found the dangers of old computers.</v>

1416
00:58:58.451 --> 00:59:01.330

1418
00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:03.580
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about to smash.</v>

1419
00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:10.200
<v Speaker 1>Everybody keeps going off about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>great the economy is in China and </v>

1420
00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:11.650
<v Speaker 1>China's becoming like a capitalist </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy and you know,</v>

1421
00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:13.340
<v Speaker 1>Chinese people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1422

<v Speaker 1>America owes China so much.</v>

1424
00:59:19.210 --> 00:59:21.160
<v Speaker 1>And then you look at what China's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

1425
00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:24.170
<v Speaker 1>like con cam or a foxconn rather.</v>

<v Speaker 1>eventually out to bring it back to them.</v>

1439
00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:54.860
<v Speaker 1>You said you want to see live meet going</v>
<v Speaker 1>from three bars to zero service.</v>

1440
00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:56.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1441
00:59:56.361 --> 00:59:58.010
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing where if you touch the</v>

1442
00:59:58.011 --> 01:00:02.300
<v Speaker 1>bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says it does something to show it.</v>

1443
01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:04.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know,</v>

1444
01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:07.100

<v Speaker 1>This fucking web cameras sucks.</v>

1445
01:00:07.710 --> 01:00:09.880
<v Speaker 1>Bars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got at least you have a couple bars,</v>

1446
01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:10.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1447
01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:12.230
<v Speaker 1>just just do it and tell us what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

1448
01:00:12.231 --> 01:00:14.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going.</v>

1449
01:00:14.541 --> 01:00:16.370
<v Speaker 1>It's going from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just went to 83.</v>

1450
01:00:16.550 --> 01:00:19.640
<v Speaker 1>It was on for actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1451
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:21.410
<v Speaker 1>it's now two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

1452
01:00:22.070 --> 01:00:27.070
<v Speaker 1>And it's now going to go to one any </v>
<v Speaker 1>second now.</v>

1453
01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:29.660
<v Speaker 1>So just slowly drops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1454
01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:34.930
<v Speaker 1>You know what apple says?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say that it's an error in the </v>

1455
01:00:34.930 --> 01:00:34.930
<v Speaker 1>followings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wild dropped down.</v>

1456
01:00:34.930 --> 01:00:35.570
<v Speaker 1>The one that's crazy that's going to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>to no service.</v>

1457
01:00:35.571 --> 01:00:40.571
<v Speaker 1>Now they say that it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an error in the phones computing and </v>

1458
01:00:40.571 --> 01:00:44.450
<v Speaker 1>that it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not an error saying searching.</v>

1459
01:00:45.050 --> 01:00:45.680
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1460
01:00:45.681 --> 01:00:50.681
<v Speaker 1>Let it go now and then it'll go back up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so apple's trying to say that it's </v>

1461
01:00:51.081 --> 01:00:56.081
<v Speaker 1>not a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to say that what you're </v>

1462
01:00:56.081 --> 01:00:56.960
<v Speaker 1>getting is just a more accurate </v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of the signals.</v>

1463
01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:59.300
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's got a signal which is whack.</v>

1464
01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:04.360
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make any sense because if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying what they're saying is </v>

1465
01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:04.360
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this is wrong,</v>

1466
01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:08.111
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have three bars right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually have one bar and covering </v>

1467
01:01:08.111 --> 01:01:10.040
<v Speaker 1>up the antenna will make it go down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just know it's a stupid.</v>

1468
01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:15.100
<v Speaker 1>It's a stupid thing to say because okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're saying that the phone just </v>

1469
01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:18.710
<v Speaker 1>calculates the bars incorrectly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>really when you touch it a certain way,</v>

1470
01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:20.300
<v Speaker 1>then it calculates them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1471
01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:22.640
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that the truth button the fuck</v>

1472
01:01:22.641 --> 01:01:24.020
<v Speaker 1>are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have,</v>

1473
01:01:24.050 --> 01:01:28.580
<v Speaker 1>you have a button and it's a part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone and if you touch it,</v>

1474
01:01:28.581 --> 01:01:30.680
<v Speaker 1>it tells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes the phone honest with you.</v>

1475
01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:32.210
<v Speaker 1>That's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a hardware problem.</v>

1476
01:01:32.211 --> 01:01:34.250
<v Speaker 1>You cocksucker right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't deal with the case,</v>

1477
01:01:34.251 --> 01:01:39.251
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is good because I never used my </v>

1478
01:01:39.251 --> 01:01:39.251
<v Speaker 1>iphone without a case.</v>

1479
01:01:39.251 --> 01:01:39.251
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He a signal here,</v>

1480
01:01:39.251 --> 01:01:39.320
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should get.</v>

1481
01:01:39.321 --> 01:01:39.990
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

1482
01:01:40.070 --> 01:01:42.230
<v Speaker 1>And when you had no signal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not normal.</v>

1483
01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is is what are they </v>

1484
01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:49.931
<v Speaker 1>going to really do about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this software update just going to </v>

1485
01:01:49.931 --> 01:01:49.931
<v Speaker 1>make all the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone that just not happen,</v>

1486
01:01:49.931 --> 01:01:52.720
<v Speaker 1>you're just going to always have lower </v>
<v Speaker 1>signal than normal.</v>

1487
01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:53.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1488
01:01:53.861 --> 01:01:57.050

1501
01:02:27.350 --> 01:02:30.771
<v Speaker 3>bumper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when you're selling poppers </v>

1502
01:02:30.771 --> 01:02:32.481
<v Speaker 3>for 30 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of Douchey in and of </v>

1503
01:02:32.481 --> 01:02:32.481
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1506
01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:39.920
<v Speaker 3>So you get that bump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you give me this little thing to put </v>

1507
01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:39.920
<v Speaker 3>around it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>how much does this little thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 bucks.</v>

1509
01:02:40.550 --> 01:02:44.520
<v Speaker 3>This is 30 bucks and only apple makes it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it should have came with a fucking.</v>

1510
01:02:44.521 --> 01:02:46.860
<v Speaker 3>You got a blackberry the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I came with a leather case.</v>

1511
01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:49.340
<v Speaker 3>I can't get a little piece of rubber,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1512
01:02:49.410 --> 01:02:54.410
<v Speaker 3>so I went to best buy and I bought two </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the only cases that best buy sells,</v>

1513
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:56.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that covered the back,</v>

1514
01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:57.180
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1515
01:02:57.181 --> 01:03:02.181
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first one I put on it was so tight </v>

1516
01:03:02.181 --> 01:03:05.190
<v Speaker 3>and poorly made,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was Belkin that the top </v>

1517
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:05.490
<v Speaker 3>button just automatically was always </v>
<v Speaker 3>pushed down.</v>

1518
01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:07.800
<v Speaker 3>So it was just resetting my phone over </v>
<v Speaker 3>and over.</v>

1519
01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:12.920
<v Speaker 3>So I had a second one that was going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>give to you and I opened that one and </v>

1520
01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:12.920
<v Speaker 3>tried it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing.</v>

1521
01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:16.551
<v Speaker 3>Went Online,</v>
<v Speaker 3>found out that's a problem with the </v>

1522
01:03:16.551 --> 01:03:18.171
<v Speaker 3>case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then I bought this other one from </v>

1523
01:03:18.171 --> 01:03:19.290
<v Speaker 3>griffith that had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a plastic back to it.</v>

1524
01:03:19.490 --> 01:03:21.720
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and every time you took a photo it would</v>

1525
01:03:21.721 --> 01:03:25.080
<v Speaker 3>flash and hit the plastic and flashback </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the camera.</v>

1526
01:03:25.081 --> 01:03:28.200
<v Speaker 3>And every photo look like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went back online.</v>

1527
01:03:28.290 --> 01:03:33.290
<v Speaker 3>Same exact thing across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the only case we can get right now is</v>

1528
01:03:33.871 --> 01:03:36.600
<v Speaker 3>this one that will protect you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fix that.</v>

1529
01:03:36.601 --> 01:03:39.030
<v Speaker 3>How do they not have cases for an </v>
<v Speaker 3>iphone?</v>

1530
01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:39.930
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>

1532
01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:43.590
<v Speaker 3>So if I break this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to replace the back because</v>

1533
01:03:43.591 --> 01:03:46.800
<v Speaker 3>there's no other fucking case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are and what is the deal with this?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Why do you have glass on the floor?</v>

1535
01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:52.380
<v Speaker 3>Reception issues means looking at what </v>

1554
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good short attention span show.</v>

1555
01:04:37.650 --> 01:04:42.650
<v Speaker 3>He just slip in and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anytime you're flipping through the </v>

1556
01:04:42.650 --> 01:04:42.930
<v Speaker 3>channels and they'll start like a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of like a,</v>

1557
01:04:42.931 --> 01:04:44.460
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the word?</v>

1558
01:04:44.730 --> 01:04:48.040
<v Speaker 3>Just a hokey sort of a reenactment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1559
01:04:48.041 --> 01:04:53.041
<v Speaker 3>where it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like a certain amount of humor </v>

1560
01:04:53.041 --> 01:04:53.041
<v Speaker 3>to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1561
01:04:53.041 --> 01:04:53.041
<v Speaker 3>and they know what they're going to show</v>
<v Speaker 3>you a fucked up way.</v>

1562
01:04:53.041 --> 01:04:55.260
<v Speaker 3>Somebody died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of creepy,</v>

1563
01:04:55.590 --> 01:05:00.590
<v Speaker 3>but it's interesting to me because then </v>
<v Speaker 3>I think about all these have that extra </v>

1564
01:05:00.590 --> 01:05:01.770
<v Speaker 3>thought every time you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to shove something up my ass.</v>

1565
01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:03.460
<v Speaker 3>I know I might die from it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1566
01:05:04.050 --> 01:05:05.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I do know.</v>

1567
01:05:06.270 --> 01:05:09.330
<v Speaker 3>I do know it's a hard urge to resist </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoving your ass.</v>

1568
01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:13.380
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it just overcomes you or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or just crossing the street with my eyes</v>

1569
01:05:13.381 --> 01:05:13.980
<v Speaker 3>closed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1570
01:05:13.981 --> 01:05:16.680
<v Speaker 3>whatever you've seen oriented showed me </v>
<v Speaker 3>one guy in one cup,</v>

1571
01:05:16.681 --> 01:05:17.800
<v Speaker 3>didn't you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody did</v>

1572
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.360
<v Speaker 1>one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one cup.</v>

1573
01:05:19.361 --> 01:05:22.960
<v Speaker 1>I think you showed it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't look for those things anymore.</v>

1574
01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:26.530
<v Speaker 1>That was the one where the guy put a jar</v>
<v Speaker 1>up his asshole.</v>

1575
01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:31.620
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he sat down and his asshole </v>

1576
01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:34.620
<v Speaker 1>crushed the jar and chunks of glass and </v>
<v Speaker 1>blood start falling out of this guy's </v>

1577
01:05:34.930 --> 01:05:37.680
<v Speaker 1>body and he doesn't even freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the most disturbing part of.</v>

1578
01:05:37.690 --> 01:05:41.230
<v Speaker 1>But I still don't know if I believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything anymore.</v>

1579
01:05:41.290 --> 01:05:42.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that one.</v>

1580
01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:45.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's a fake glass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if that's not fake.</v>

1581
01:05:45.591 --> 01:05:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Someone needs a Goddamn Academy award.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bme Pan Olympics was fake.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

1583
01:05:49.850 --> 01:05:52.000
<v Speaker 1>A lot of that is not fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all fake.</v>

1584
01:05:52.030 --> 01:05:55.900
<v Speaker 1>People say it's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that that knows the most</v>

1585
01:05:55.901 --> 01:05:56.940
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have it on my wife's side.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that one.</v>

1587
01:05:58.570 --> 01:06:00.850
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't one of them to cut his finger </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:15.130
<v Speaker 2>floor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1717
01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:17.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm so glad they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1718
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:21.630
<v Speaker 2>Rock is one of those people that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have to worry about stopping.</v>

1719
01:11:21.631 --> 01:11:24.090
<v Speaker 2>It's going to take a few trains into </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1720
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:26.980
<v Speaker 2>It really stopped the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm glad that means you know,</v>

1721
01:11:27.070 --> 01:11:28.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1722
01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:30.840
<v Speaker 2>trains to the head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean he,</v>

1723
01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.820
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't stop it so I was happy.</v>

1724
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:38.000
<v Speaker 2>I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was so scared they're going to stop </v>

1725
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:38.000
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1726
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:38.190
<v Speaker 2>Well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looked like they were gonna stop it.</v>

1727
01:11:38.191 --> 01:11:43.191
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was just covering up and Shankar was </v>

1728
01:11:43.191 --> 01:11:45.561
<v Speaker 2>bombing on them and props to referee </v>
<v Speaker 2>Josh Rosenthal because it wasn't for </v>

1729
01:11:45.561 --> 01:11:45.561
<v Speaker 2>Josh Rosenthal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1730
01:11:45.561 --> 01:11:50.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone easily could have pulled the </v>

1731
01:11:50.370 --> 01:11:52.341
<v Speaker 2>trigger earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now there's a few guys that I </v>

1732
01:11:52.341 --> 01:11:53.070
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't have trusted in that situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Josh saw that he was okay.</v>

1733
01:11:53.071 --> 01:11:58.071
<v Speaker 2>He was going to get through it and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>saw the change punches were coming </v>

1734
01:11:58.071 --> 01:11:58.560
<v Speaker 2>slower and slower and Shane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately it just blew his wad.</v>

1735
01:11:58.590 --> 01:11:59.290
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1736
01:11:59.370 --> 01:12:00.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had an adrenaline dump,</v>

1737
01:12:00.991 --> 01:12:03.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure the excitement of the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a,</v>

1738
01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:06.300
<v Speaker 2>the champ hurting on his back and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was on top and he's like,</v>

1739
01:12:06.301 --> 01:12:11.301
<v Speaker 2>this is over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fucking thing is over and it's </v>

1740
01:12:11.301 --> 01:12:11.301
<v Speaker 2>pounded and pounded on Panama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then also has like,</v>

1741
01:12:11.301 --> 01:12:15.351
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's two minutes left to go in this </v>

1742
01:12:15.351 --> 01:12:15.351
<v Speaker 2>round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1743
01:12:15.351 --> 01:12:15.570
<v Speaker 2>And then he's got to keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the end of those two minutes,</v>

1744
01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:20.600
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got back to his corner and literally </v>

1745
01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:23.571
<v Speaker 2>could barely get up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His legs were barely walking and he was </v>

1746
01:12:23.571 --> 01:12:27.471
<v Speaker 2>fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said his legs seized up and he said </v>

1747
01:12:27.471 --> 01:12:27.510
<v Speaker 2>he just went out there and he tried to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do whatever he could,</v>

1748
01:12:27.511 --> 01:12:31.890
<v Speaker 2>but his body just was not responding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just completely adrenaline dumped and</v>

1749
01:12:31.891 --> 01:12:35.200
<v Speaker 2>completely blew out all of his energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But God damn does.</v>

1750
01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:38.160
<v Speaker 2>He hit him hard before that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1751
01:12:38.161 --> 01:12:41.640
<v Speaker 2>That fucking Shankar when can punch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had so hard.</v>

1752
01:12:41.641 --> 01:12:44.730
<v Speaker 2>He's so big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think he's too big.</v>

1753
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:48.900
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe like because he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had to lose 17 pounds to make a,</v>

1754
01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:50.670
<v Speaker 2>to 65,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he's,</v>

1755
01:12:50.671 --> 01:12:54.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>walking in like at like somewhere around</v>

1756
01:12:54.061 --> 01:12:55.070
<v Speaker 2>two 80 ish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1757
01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:58.740
<v Speaker 2>on the day of the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that might be too big for his</v>

1758
01:12:58.741 --> 01:12:59.660
<v Speaker 2>frame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1759
01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:02.670
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe he might be better off if </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like 2:50,</v>

1760
01:13:02.850 --> 01:13:04.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a little lighter.</v>

1761
01:13:04.111 --> 01:13:09.111
<v Speaker 2>But with more endurance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his punches are still going to be </v>

1762
01:13:09.111 --> 01:13:11.871
<v Speaker 2>ridiculously powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody could stand up to the way that </v>

1763
01:13:11.871 --> 01:13:11.910
<v Speaker 2>guy hits his punches will still be </v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculously powerful,</v>

1764
01:13:11.911 --> 01:13:14.500
<v Speaker 2>but he'll have a little bit more cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1765
01:13:14.670 --> 01:13:16.740
<v Speaker 2>brock is just physically a bigger guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

1766
01:13:16.770 --> 01:13:21.480
<v Speaker 2>Brock Brock really has a 270 pound man's</v>
<v Speaker 2>body means so wide.</v>

1767
01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:24.720
<v Speaker 2>He's just a big giant freak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carlin's not as wide,</v>

1768
01:13:24.750 --> 01:13:29.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's still biggest fuck a big giant </v>

1769
01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:29.750
<v Speaker 2>hands and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1770
01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:31.680
<v Speaker 2>I think brock maybe can carry a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit more weight naturally.</v>

1771
01:13:31.681 --> 01:13:35.970
<v Speaker 2>Then Shane can and these guys when they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they train really hard with weights</v>

1772
01:13:35.971 --> 01:13:37.680
<v Speaker 2>and power lifting and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1773
01:13:37.681 --> 01:13:42.681
<v Speaker 2>It makes you stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gives you a lot more muscle and that </v>

1774
01:13:42.681 --> 01:13:43.380
<v Speaker 2>muscle got to get fed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to get fed by blood,</v>

1775
01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:46.700
<v Speaker 2>but goddamn it was exciting as fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>before it's for.</v>

1776
01:13:46.710 --> 01:13:48.920
<v Speaker 2>It was over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does you still have his mouthpiece?</v>

1777
01:13:48.930 --> 01:13:51.210
<v Speaker 2>Everything in his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put it in yet.</v>

1778
01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:54.960
<v Speaker 2>Tasted tasted the taste of a warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's right over there.</v>

1779
01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:58.610
<v Speaker 2>He stuck it in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My pocket was over.</v>

1780
01:13:58.750 --> 01:14:01.540
<v Speaker 2>I said I'm gonna sell that shit on Ebay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just going to hang onto it now.</v>

1781
01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:02.950
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking.</v>

1782
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A trivia moment.</v>

1783
01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:08.610
<v Speaker 2>Plus it was a what a comeback.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he came out for that second round,</v>

1784
01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:10.470
<v Speaker 2>his hands were up high and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1785
01:14:10.471 --> 01:14:12.550
<v Speaker 2>you just knew this motherfucker's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>going away.</v>

1786
01:14:12.730 --> 01:14:17.730
<v Speaker 2>He got hit with some bombs and he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>still there and still in really good </v>

1787
01:14:17.730 --> 01:14:18.070
<v Speaker 2>shape and that was really the big </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference.</v>

1788
01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:21.280
<v Speaker 2>He took shane down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten Shane's half card passed,</v>

1789
01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:26.490
<v Speaker 2>got on top of him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got him in an arm triangle and put them </v>

1790
01:14:26.490 --> 01:14:27.310
<v Speaker 2>to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking sweet or put them to tap.</v>

1791
01:14:27.490 --> 01:14:32.490
<v Speaker 2>He would've gone to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He really cranked it tight and brock is </v>

1792
01:14:32.490 --> 01:14:32.490
<v Speaker 2>so gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>

1793
01:14:32.490 --> 01:14:34.840
<v Speaker 2>they also call it a side joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's two different versions of it.</v>

1794
01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:39.870
<v Speaker 2>There's one like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do it like this and that's why it's </v>

1795
01:14:39.870 --> 01:14:39.870
<v Speaker 2>called an arm triangle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the way brock did,</v>

1796
01:14:39.870 --> 01:14:44.791
<v Speaker 2>I think he did it with a gable grip </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you do it like this where it's </v>

1797
01:14:44.791 --> 01:14:44.791
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really more of a side choke,</v>

1798
01:14:44.791 --> 01:14:49.350
<v Speaker 2>but brock is so big and so fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>strong that when he just crushes down </v>

1799
01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:50.650
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you really don't have any options,</v>

1800
01:14:50.651 --> 01:14:51.730
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to go to sleep.</v>

1801
01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:56.790
<v Speaker 2>He just got much too much power and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just going to quash that whole area </v>

1802
01:14:56.790 --> 01:15:00.811
<v Speaker 2>between your arm and your neck and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's going to get smushed and </v>

1803
01:15:00.811 --> 01:15:01.420
<v Speaker 2>there's not going to be any air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the best.</v>

1804
01:15:01.421 --> 01:15:04.780
<v Speaker 2>UFC is I think in a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a dude.</v>

1805
01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:08.680
<v Speaker 2>I was standing up during the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so exciting.</v>

1806
01:15:08.681 --> 01:15:10.930
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't fucking sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stood up.</v>

1807
01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:11.980
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>

1808
01:15:12.190 --> 01:15:14.590
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when a car would hit him and you know,</v>

1809
01:15:14.591 --> 01:15:15.620
<v Speaker 2>he went to the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

1810
01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:18.010
<v Speaker 2>it was the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was so much energy in the arena.</v>

1811
01:15:18.011 --> 01:15:21.160
<v Speaker 2>It was so unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when brock took him down at the</v>

1812
01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:26.160
<v Speaker 2>end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like the whole thing was just so </v>

1813
01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:26.950
<v Speaker 2>nice and then when they tapped like it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was just fucking craziness,</v>

1814
01:15:26.951 --> 01:15:28.150
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was so much energy.</v>

1815
01:15:28.270 --> 01:15:29.710
<v Speaker 2>I stood up like three or four times.</v>

1816
01:15:30.150 --> 01:15:31.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1817
01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:36.300
<v Speaker 2>That's the only fight I've ever had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stand up in the middle of it because it </v>

1818
01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:38.911
<v Speaker 2>was so crazy though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like as far as like sheer entertainment </v>

1819
01:15:38.911 --> 01:15:40.030
<v Speaker 2>value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a fucking fight.</v>

1820
01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:45.270
<v Speaker 2>There was a bunch of sheer entertainment</v>
<v Speaker 2>value fights that were just off the </v>

1821
01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:47.830
<v Speaker 2>charts like Liebman and Akiyama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1822
01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:49.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was crazy,</v>

1823
01:15:49.031 --> 01:15:51.760
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For sheer entertainment.</v>

1824
01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:55.420
<v Speaker 2>That fight was better than any fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie that's ever been made.</v>

1825
01:15:55.421 --> 01:15:58.240
<v Speaker 2>Has there ever been any photos of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>face since then?</v>

1826
01:15:58.270 --> 01:15:59.200
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leaving.</v>

1827
01:15:59.270 --> 01:16:00.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to leave.</v>

1828
01:16:00.041 --> 01:16:05.041
<v Speaker 2>It's probably fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It probably looks today like nobody had </v>

1829
01:16:05.041 --> 01:16:05.041
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

<v Speaker 2>His legs went rubbery.</v>

1833
01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:11.710
<v Speaker 2>He bounces backwards for a second and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then starts walking forwards again,</v>

1834
01:16:11.711 --> 01:16:14.770
<v Speaker 2>like a fucking Zombie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was incredible.</v>

01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:20.580
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like literally like right out of </v>

01:16:23.021 --> 01:16:25.420
<v Speaker 2>He takes them right on the chin and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>keeps going.</v>

1839
01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:29.020
<v Speaker 2>The only person has been able to put </v>
<v Speaker 2>them away as Anderson Anderson's.</v>

1840
01:16:29.021 --> 01:16:32.320
<v Speaker 2>Just way too fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Way Too technical.</v>

1841
01:16:32.321 --> 01:16:37.321
<v Speaker 2>Way to fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just way to gifted Anderson is just on </v>

1842
01:16:37.321 --> 01:16:39.340
<v Speaker 2>another level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for a lot of other people,</v>

1843
01:16:39.341 --> 01:16:40.070
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1844
01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:44.140
<v Speaker 2>it's like Arturo God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he couldn't fight with floyd mayweather.</v>

1845
01:16:44.141 --> 01:16:46.300
<v Speaker 2>He got in there with floyd mayweather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just couldn't compete.</v>

1846
01:16:46.330 --> 01:16:51.330
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't compete with the style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't compete with the technical </v>

1847
01:16:51.330 --> 01:16:51.330
<v Speaker 2>superiority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the speed,</v>

<v Speaker 2>lit up.</v>

1850
01:16:56.050 --> 01:16:57.550
<v Speaker 2>But when he found someone like Micky </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ward,</v>

1851
01:16:57.551 --> 01:16:59.110
<v Speaker 2>who was like in his ball,</v>

<v Speaker 2>fights ever.</v>

1854
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:09.000
<v Speaker 2>It's just a matter of getting them the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right opponent and leave and keeps </v>

<v Speaker 2>You know Erin Simpson,</v>

1859
01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:16.580
<v Speaker 2>the guy who beat before he beat this guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a bad motherfucker.</v>

1860
01:17:16.581 --> 01:17:19.210
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aaron's a serious fucking wrestler.</v>

1861

<v Speaker 2>Strongest Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Incredible endurance.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just a.</v>

1863
01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:28.480
<v Speaker 2>his fight with Tom Lawler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got nailed from pillar to post in </v>

1864
01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:29.600
<v Speaker 2>that first round and then the second </v>
<v Speaker 2>round,</v>

1865
01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:34.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he came back and he fucking started </v>

1866
01:17:34.770 --> 01:17:37.121
<v Speaker 2>taking lower down in the third round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He came back and won that round two and </v>

1867
01:17:37.121 --> 01:17:39.320
<v Speaker 2>wound up getting the decision when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>looked like he was a dead band.</v>

1868
01:17:39.321 --> 01:17:42.680
<v Speaker 2>The first round he was getting battered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this guy is tough as fuck.</v>

1869
01:17:42.710 --> 01:17:44.360
<v Speaker 2>So when leave and put them away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1873
01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:50.840
<v Speaker 2>And then the next fight to go right from</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1874
01:17:50.841 --> 01:17:53.650
<v Speaker 2>two weeks later to fight Akiyama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:55.850
<v Speaker 2>hockey,</v>

1876
01:17:55.850 --> 01:17:58.850
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Knocked out Dennis kangs fast as fuck.</v>

1877
01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:00.080
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Judo,</v>

<v Speaker 2>row.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how about that?</v>

1881
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:09.930
<v Speaker 2>Christophe Sinskey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stephan Bonner that,</v>

1882
01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:12.510
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my second favorite.</v>

1883
01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:17.540
<v Speaker 2>The night attack like a man possessed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was odd.</v>

1884
01:18:18.230 --> 01:18:22.760
<v Speaker 2>He knew that like it was do or die time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had lost a coleman.</v>

1885
01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:23.730
<v Speaker 2>He had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1886
01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:26.310
<v Speaker 2>had the fight with Susan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that guy will always have a home in the </v>

1888
01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:31.750
<v Speaker 2>UFC because he's a part of the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight in the history of the sport,</v>

1889
01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:36.491
<v Speaker 2>the most important fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fight that got everybody to pay </v>

1890
01:18:36.491 --> 01:18:38.621
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fight with him and Stephan Bonner </v>

1891
01:18:38.621 --> 01:18:38.650
<v Speaker 2>when they were on spike TV when it was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>final,</v>

1892
01:18:38.670 --> 01:18:43.670
<v Speaker 2>the ultimate fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the very first season people were so </v>

1893
01:18:43.670 --> 01:18:46.190
<v Speaker 2>many people were tuning in while the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight was on that I think the.</v>

1894
01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:49.070
<v Speaker 2>The amount of people viewing the fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the fight,</v>

1895
01:18:49.130 --> 01:18:54.130
<v Speaker 2>by the time the first card start with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first part of the cards started to </v>

1896
01:18:54.130 --> 01:18:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Stephan Bonner and forrest griffin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forrest griffin fight.</v>

1897
01:18:54.861 --> 01:18:56.780
<v Speaker 2>They had it like doubled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tripled,</v>

1898
01:18:56.781 --> 01:18:59.870
<v Speaker 2>quadrupled at one point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some insane number,</v>

1899
01:18:59.871 --> 01:19:01.910
<v Speaker 2>like six to 10 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They estimated,</v>

1900
01:19:02.150 --> 01:19:04.500
<v Speaker 2>I forget what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like some something crazy.</v>

1901
01:19:04.501 --> 01:19:09.501
<v Speaker 2>It was watching that fight when nobody </v>
<v Speaker 2>is watching spike tv before that just </v>

1902
01:19:09.501 --> 01:19:09.860
<v Speaker 2>people were calling their friends and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>

1903
01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:12.080
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to fucking turn this on.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Whatever it is.</v>

1905
01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:15.680
<v Speaker 2>These two guys are beating the shit out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of each other.</v>

1906
01:19:15.890 --> 01:19:19.130
<v Speaker 2>And Forrest Griffin and Stephan Bonner </v>
<v Speaker 2>had like a movie fight.</v>

1907
01:19:19.530 --> 01:19:22.400
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't even real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a goddamn every which way,</v>

1908
01:19:22.401 --> 01:19:24.240
<v Speaker 2>but loose clint eastwood movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1909
01:19:24.270 --> 01:19:29.270
<v Speaker 2>it was him fighting tank Murdoch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They beat each other all over the </v>

1910
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:31.100
<v Speaker 2>fucking place and kept coming one after </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other for 15 solid minutes.</v>

1911
01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:33.380
<v Speaker 2>There'll be backed out for a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1912
01:19:33.381 --> 01:19:37.280
<v Speaker 2>so he'll always have like a strong place</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the organization.</v>

1913
01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:40.130
<v Speaker 2>They'll will always have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always have love for that dude.</v>

1914
01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:43.020
<v Speaker 2>But he also knew that he wants to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1915
01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:45.440
<v Speaker 2>back in the heat at at two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh five.</v>

1916
01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:50.470
<v Speaker 2>He wants to be fighting up to his </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential and he knows he's had some </v>

1917
01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:51.920
<v Speaker 2>good outings and some not so good </v>
<v Speaker 2>outings that Jon Jones fight.</v>

1918
01:19:51.921 --> 01:19:54.050
<v Speaker 2>It was a tough loss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had three tough losses in a row.</v>

1919
01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:57.830
<v Speaker 2>So he stepped in like fucking wild man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Felt like his life was on the line.</v>

1920
01:19:57.831 --> 01:20:01.580
<v Speaker 2>I was actually surprised to see him back</v>
<v Speaker 2>since the last one.</v>

1921
01:20:01.670 --> 01:20:03.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm glad because I always liked that</v>

1922
01:20:03.681 --> 01:20:03.980
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1923
01:20:03.981 --> 01:20:04.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got,</v>

1924
01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:07.500
<v Speaker 2>he got 'em through when Coleman got </v>
<v Speaker 2>caught,</v>

1925
01:20:07.501 --> 01:20:10.530
<v Speaker 2>man Coleman called tour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got caught,</v>

1926
01:20:10.531 --> 01:20:13.680
<v Speaker 2>but right before coleman a coture or </v>
<v Speaker 2>last to go to a rather.</v>

1927
01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:15.090
<v Speaker 2>He beat her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1928
01:20:15.091 --> 01:20:20.010
<v Speaker 2>So are you surprised that like Kimbo was</v>
<v Speaker 2>not given an extra shot or.</v>

1929
01:20:20.930 --> 01:20:23.220
<v Speaker 2>Yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see the point,</v>

1930
01:20:23.380 --> 01:20:26.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really if he wasn't Kimbo you would have</v>

1931
01:20:26.671 --> 01:20:31.671
<v Speaker 2>to cut them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt Mitrione beat him down and it </v>

1932
01:20:31.671 --> 01:20:31.671
<v Speaker 2>looked like he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1933
01:20:31.671 --> 01:20:32.580
<v Speaker 2>it didn't look like he was in the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of condition.</v>

1934
01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:37.880
<v Speaker 2>It looks like he got really tired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His technical prowess wasn't up to the </v>

1935
01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:41.181
<v Speaker 2>level of material and material and an </v>
<v Speaker 2>improved much more from his time on the </v>

1936
01:20:41.181 --> 01:20:44.571
<v Speaker 2>ultimate fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you also have to wonder about </v>

1937
01:20:44.571 --> 01:20:47.480
<v Speaker 2>Kimball's body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kimble had some real knee problems on </v>

1938
01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:47.910
<v Speaker 2>the show and the knee problems that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>had on the show.</v>

1939
01:20:47.911 --> 01:20:51.900
<v Speaker 2>They weren't like fixable things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like bone on bone type shit.</v>

1940
01:20:51.901 --> 01:20:54.600
<v Speaker 2>Like he's worn out the cartilage and one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of his knees,</v>

1941
01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:56.700
<v Speaker 2>which means that you can't train as </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard,</v>

1942
01:20:56.730 --> 01:20:59.110
<v Speaker 2>you can't sprawl and you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1943
01:20:59.111 --> 01:21:01.290
<v Speaker 2>do the kind of wrestling training that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to kink it.</v>

1944
01:21:01.290 --> 01:21:03.390
<v Speaker 2>Your legs kicked the way you kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to get kicked,</v>

1945
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:05.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got like a pretty serious problem.</v>

1946
01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:09.960
<v Speaker 2>That problem kept him from fighting in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the main event or getting another,</v>

1947
01:21:09.970 --> 01:21:12.570
<v Speaker 2>a shot at getting back in the heat of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sharp member.</v>

1948
01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:14.760
<v Speaker 2>He got eliminated and then they offered </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to him.</v>

1949
01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:17.980
<v Speaker 2>They offered him a fight and he passed </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the fight because it was knee.</v>

1950
01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:20.940
<v Speaker 2>That's not something that gets better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

1951
01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:24.870
<v Speaker 2>unless he's got some sort of a cartilage</v>
<v Speaker 2>replacement surgery or I don't know what</v>

1952
01:21:24.871 --> 01:21:29.871
<v Speaker 2>they're even able to do these days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a problem with that knee and </v>

1953
01:21:29.871 --> 01:21:33.170
<v Speaker 2>that knee is going to keep them from </v>
<v Speaker 2>being able to train the way the way a </v>

1954
01:21:33.170 --> 01:21:34.920
<v Speaker 2>GSP thiago alves trains or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of the killers.</v>

1955
01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:37.020
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1956
01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:42.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you can still make a lot of </v>

1957
01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:42.440
<v Speaker 2>money off the guy and the guy still </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to fight.</v>

1958
01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:42.810
<v Speaker 2>I look at it as like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1959
01:21:42.811 --> 01:21:47.811
<v Speaker 2>butter bean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maryland butter bean was king of the </v>

1960
01:21:47.811 --> 01:21:47.811
<v Speaker 2>four rounders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1961
01:21:47.811 --> 01:21:51.230
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean you don't use butter </v>
<v Speaker 2>being on your car just because it's not </v>

1962
01:21:51.230 --> 01:21:51.230
<v Speaker 2>going to beat Larry Holmes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1963
01:21:51.230 --> 01:21:51.570
<v Speaker 2>kept butter being out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>

1964
01:21:51.571 --> 01:21:52.530
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put them out there.</v>

1965
01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:53.450
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1966
01:21:53.490 --> 01:21:55.410
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still entertaining.</v>

1967
01:21:55.650 --> 01:21:56.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like Chris,</v>

1968
01:21:57.060 --> 01:21:59.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean Chris Leben is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1969
01:21:59.251 --> 01:22:01.560
<v Speaker 2>he's battling it out with the best in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

1970
01:22:01.561 --> 01:22:02.790
<v Speaker 2>He's beaten,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Akiyama,</v>

1971
01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:03.330
<v Speaker 2>beaten,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1972
01:22:03.331 --> 01:22:05.670
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's starting to move up in the chain,</v>

1973
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:09.000
<v Speaker 2>but the end of the rainbow for him was </v>
<v Speaker 2>always going to be Anderson Silva.</v>

1974
01:22:09.260 --> 01:22:10.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anderson.</v>

1975
01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:11.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1976
01:22:11.250 --> 01:22:14.210
<v Speaker 2>anybody can beat anybody on any given </v>
<v Speaker 2>day a zig zag.</v>

1977
01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:15.720
<v Speaker 2>You run into one of Chris' lievens </v>
<v Speaker 2>punches.</v>

1978
01:22:15.930 --> 01:22:20.930
<v Speaker 2>You could be in a lot of trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but technically the two are so far </v>

1979
01:22:20.930 --> 01:22:20.930
<v Speaker 2>apart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1980
01:22:20.930 --> 01:22:23.220
<v Speaker 2>Anderson is in such a different level </v>
<v Speaker 2>athletically,</v>

1981
01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:24.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1982
01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:25.830
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his ease of movement,</v>

1983
01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:26.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like,</v>

1984
01:22:26.850 --> 01:22:27.330
<v Speaker 2>what do you do?</v>

1985
01:22:27.330 --> 01:22:32.330
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to cut leap and why </v>
<v Speaker 2>would you cut them one of the most </v>

1986
01:22:32.330 --> 01:22:32.610
<v Speaker 2>entertaining fighters in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even if you can't beat Anderson,</v>

1987
01:22:32.810 --> 01:22:37.810
<v Speaker 2>you've got to keep them around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if he can never beat the best guy </v>

1988
01:22:37.810 --> 01:22:37.810
<v Speaker 2>in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I'm not saying he can't,</v>

1989
01:22:37.810 --> 01:22:38.280
<v Speaker 2>you never know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never fucking know.</v>

1990
01:22:38.281 --> 01:22:43.281
<v Speaker 2>And he's improving and shit happens and </v>
<v Speaker 2>weirder things have taken place in this </v>

1991
01:22:43.281 --> 01:22:44.190
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if even if he doesn't,</v>

1992
01:22:44.370 --> 01:22:46.980
<v Speaker 2>if he never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he can never beat Anderson,</v>

1993
01:22:47.010 --> 01:22:48.720
<v Speaker 2>he should still be around because he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>awesome,</v>

1994
01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:51.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's fucking fun as shit to watch.</v>

1995
01:22:52.020 --> 01:22:57.020
<v Speaker 2>So I think that about Kimbo too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Kim was fun to watch and even </v>

1996
01:22:57.020 --> 01:22:59.520
<v Speaker 2>though he's not like that at the level </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1997
01:22:59.570 --> 01:23:04.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a junior dos Santos is or Cain </v>

1998
01:23:04.570 --> 01:23:04.570
<v Speaker 2>Velasquez,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not at that level.</v>

1999
01:23:04.570 --> 01:23:05.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean you just got to match correctly.</v>

2000
01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:10.000
<v Speaker 2>Just just accept the fact that this guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>is never going to be a title contender.</v>

2001
01:23:10.001 --> 01:23:12.820
<v Speaker 2>And even though that's not really what </v>
<v Speaker 2>the UFC is all about,</v>

2002
01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:15.370
<v Speaker 2>UFC is the very best guys fighting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>very best guys.</v>

2003
01:23:16.290 --> 01:23:19.840
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't maybe hurt throwing a young </v>
<v Speaker 2>gun in there with a gatekeeper.</v>

2004
01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:21.820
<v Speaker 2>Make Kimbo a gatekeeper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2005
01:23:22.030 --> 01:23:22.610
<v Speaker 2>make um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2006
01:23:22.611 --> 01:23:24.820
<v Speaker 2>a guy that you test young guys with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's key.</v>

2007
01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:29.880
<v Speaker 2>That makes it kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As long as kimball wants to keep doing </v>

2008
01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:32.521
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if he keeps losing and then you </v>

2009
01:23:32.521 --> 01:23:32.521
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets to a point where nobody wants to</v>

2010
01:23:32.521 --> 01:23:33.370
<v Speaker 2>see him anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then maybe stop using them.</v>

2011
01:23:33.950 --> 01:23:38.950
<v Speaker 2>What do you have a chance?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you think Dana white would </v>

2012
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:39.100
<v Speaker 2>say about having a UFC bar?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was just in the middle.</v>

2013
01:23:39.101 --> 01:23:44.101
<v Speaker 2>There was an octagon and every night you</v>
<v Speaker 2>just go there and there's people </v>

2014
01:23:44.101 --> 01:23:44.101
<v Speaker 2>fighting constantly.</v>

2015
01:23:44.101 --> 01:23:45.850
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't have that many people fighting.</v>

2016
01:23:46.210 --> 01:23:46.940
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2017
01:23:46.970 --> 01:23:48.880
<v Speaker 2>You know it to be too hard to sanction </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2018
01:23:49.250 --> 01:23:52.630
<v Speaker 2>It'll be too hard to ensure that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody had their proper medicals.</v>

2019
01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:55.900
<v Speaker 2>It'd be too hard to find qualified </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighters because they can't fight.</v>

2020
01:23:55.901 --> 01:23:56.830
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2021
01:23:56.920 --> 01:24:01.920
<v Speaker 2>leaving thought Erin Simpson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then two weeks later he fought Akiyama </v>

2022
01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:05.220
<v Speaker 2>very unusual for most people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a few months off in between </v>

2023
01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:08.371
<v Speaker 2>fights in a lot of that is because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get beat up and you got to relax and </v>

2024
01:24:08.371 --> 01:24:08.371
<v Speaker 2>rest and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and heal up.</v>

2025
01:24:08.371 --> 01:24:08.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have any injuries,</v>

2026
01:24:08.711 --> 01:24:11.500
<v Speaker 2>they have to be fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some guys break their hands,</v>

2027
01:24:11.501 --> 01:24:13.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some guys pull ligaments,</v>

2028
01:24:13.211 --> 01:24:14.680
<v Speaker 2>they have to get operations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2029
01:24:14.770 --> 01:24:16.400
<v Speaker 2>Shogun just got an operation on his </v>
<v Speaker 2>knee.</v>

2030
01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:19.030
<v Speaker 2>Can imagine if they did that like in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegas or something.</v>

2031
01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:24.040
<v Speaker 2>I think a better bar solution when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC has this gigantic library of 116 </v>

2032
01:24:24.941 --> 01:24:28.570
<v Speaker 2>events,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best idea is to serve good food,</v>

2033
01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:31.210
<v Speaker 2>have a cool bar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and have the UFC plans data,</v>

2034
01:24:31.260 --> 01:24:32.990
<v Speaker 2>all these different fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2035
01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:36.490
<v Speaker 2>television steak bar with UFC </v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>

2036
01:24:36.550 --> 01:24:41.550
<v Speaker 2>And then when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the live shows they have like </v>

2037
01:24:41.550 --> 01:24:41.550
<v Speaker 2>huge movie theater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2038
01:24:41.550 --> 01:24:43.060
<v Speaker 2>During or they have it on every goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 2>10 in the room during a live show.</v>

2039
01:24:43.061 --> 01:24:45.790
<v Speaker 2>They have it on every Goddamn TV in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>room and you have to pay 20 bucks to get</v>

2040
01:24:45.791 --> 01:24:47.380
<v Speaker 2>in or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And call it town.</v>

2041
01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:51.400
<v Speaker 2>They would clean the fuck up one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC bar because really it would be.</v>

2042
01:24:51.410 --> 01:24:56.410
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a cool thing about watching it </v>

2043
01:24:56.410 --> 01:24:56.410
<v Speaker 2>live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love watching fights live because it's</v>

2044
01:24:56.410 --> 01:24:58.110
<v Speaker 2>crazy and you're right there when it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going down.</v>

2045
01:24:58.130 --> 01:25:01.480
<v Speaker 2>It's really nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That experience is nothing like anything</v>

2046
01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:04.060
<v Speaker 2>you've ever had before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If your seats are good,</v>

2047
01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:06.610
<v Speaker 2>but if your seats aren't that good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2048
01:25:06.611 --> 01:25:08.050
<v Speaker 2>if you're in the bleachers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2049
01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:13.240
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of cool being there still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's pretty fucking bad ass to go to</v>

2050
01:25:13.241 --> 01:25:15.430
<v Speaker 2>a place with a bunch of other people and</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch it on TV.</v>

2051
01:25:15.850 --> 01:25:20.850
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like having a ufc bar where people know </v>

2052
01:25:20.850 --> 01:25:21.460
<v Speaker 2>if you can't afford to go to Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you're living in another city.</v>

2053
01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:26.700
<v Speaker 2>Everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all your friends are going to go to the </v>

2054
01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:26.700
<v Speaker 2>UFC bar and watch the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

2055
01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:27.550
<v Speaker 2>I think it would be for mma fans alone </v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything.</v>

2056
01:25:27.551 --> 01:25:30.040
<v Speaker 2>I think Dana could have like its own </v>
<v Speaker 2>little mini Davis desserts,</v>

2057
01:25:30.041 --> 01:25:33.340
<v Speaker 2>peroxide or status.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think very shallow.</v>

2058
01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:36.490
<v Speaker 2>Grave again is a Ravioli.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do Revenue.</v>

2059
01:25:39.010 --> 01:25:44.010
<v Speaker 2>Why do I have Ravioli?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would work?</v>

2060
01:25:44.830 --> 01:25:46.550
<v Speaker 2>That would work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but having live fights,</v>

2061
01:25:46.570 --> 01:25:48.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that would work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there'll be a little too much.</v>

2062
01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:49.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

2063
01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:53.830
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that's doing good too.</v>

2064
01:25:54.210 --> 01:25:59.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really think about it pretty </v>

2065
01:25:59.210 --> 01:25:59.210
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some dude,</v>

2066
01:25:59.210 --> 01:26:01.090
<v Speaker 2>a facebook me from a UFC champion was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2067
01:26:01.150 --> 01:26:02.630

<v Speaker 2>You have to be driven by fear.</v>

2068
01:26:02.650 --> 01:26:03.790
<v Speaker 2>We're in town in a workout</v>

2069
01:26:04.450 --> 01:26:06.500
<v Speaker 1>buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that sounds like a great idea.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They're gonna.</v>

2073
01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:15.740
<v Speaker 1>What kind of liability do you have if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you let dudes actually beat the shit out</v>

2074
01:26:15.741 --> 01:26:18.170
<v Speaker 1>of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know because if you have sparring,</v>

2075
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:21.550
<v Speaker 1>the bottom line is you're not going </v>
<v Speaker 1>through extensive medicals when you have</v>

2076
01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:26.560
<v Speaker 1>sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when dudes spar and kickboxing </v>

2084
01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:46.400
<v Speaker 1>climb in the ring with another dude that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't even know and you say,</v>

2085

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2090
01:26:53.241 --> 01:26:54.950
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time dudes are cool,</v>

2091
01:26:54.951 --> 01:26:56.840
<v Speaker 1>but every now and then dudes will try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take your head off.</v>

2092
01:26:56.990 --> 01:27:01.990
<v Speaker 1>They don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might have an aneurysm just ready to </v>

2093
01:27:01.990 --> 01:27:01.990
<v Speaker 1>pop right behind your eyeball and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>touches you in a chin.</v>

2094
01:27:01.990 --> 01:27:03.230
<v Speaker 1>Your legs go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fall,</v>

2095
01:27:03.231 --> 01:27:06.320
<v Speaker 1>you hit your head on the back of the mat</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that thing burst and just fills your</v>

2096
01:27:06.321 --> 01:27:08.450
<v Speaker 1>eyeballs with blood and you fucking die </v>
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>

2097

<v Speaker 1>I need to go to.</v>

2098
01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:12.830
<v Speaker 1>When I went to get my eyes checked a </v>
<v Speaker 1>while back,</v>

2099
01:27:12.831 --> 01:27:17.831

<v Speaker 1>there was something in the back of your </v>

2100
01:27:17.831 --> 01:27:19.631
<v Speaker 1>eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably nothing but you should </v>

2101
01:27:19.631 --> 01:27:19.631
<v Speaker 1>take her to a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

2102
01:27:19.631 --> 01:27:19.631

<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't know it right now to smoke a </v>

2105
01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:25.700

<v Speaker 1>Since the 18th of June.</v>

2108

2111
01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:43.480
<v Speaker 1>the weight watchers diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is modified,</v>

2112
01:27:43.610 --> 01:27:46.790
<v Speaker 1>meaning you take in less calories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A weight watchers is.</v>

2113
01:27:46.791 --> 01:27:49.970
<v Speaker 1>You have this many points you use them </v>
<v Speaker 1>based on is the food,</v>

2114
01:27:49.971 --> 01:27:52.790
<v Speaker 1>like an orange is two points,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know as sandwiches,</v>

2115
01:27:52.791 --> 01:27:53.780
<v Speaker 1>six points,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2116
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:58.990
<v Speaker 1>So what I've been doing is doing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight watchers diet but only eating </v>

2117
01:27:58.990 --> 01:27:59.930
<v Speaker 1>zero to one point shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So mostly vegetables.</v>

2118
01:27:59.931 --> 01:28:04.931
<v Speaker 1>Most of you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You eat little small meals to keep your </v>

2119
01:28:04.931 --> 01:28:04.931
<v Speaker 1>metabolism.</v>

2120
01:28:04.931 --> 01:28:08.510
<v Speaker 1>They eat small meals throughout the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's all like one point zero</v>

2121
01:28:08.511 --> 01:28:13.070
<v Speaker 1>point shit and I'm not going anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>close to my allotted 35 points a day.</v>

2122
01:28:13.071 --> 01:28:16.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably doing seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven points a day.</v>

2123
01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:18.110
<v Speaker 1>You're like a little checks.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2127
01:28:23.150 --> 01:28:28.001

<v Speaker 1>nutrients and proteins and all that </v>

<v Speaker 1>got heavy and then he got skinny.</v>

2142
01:29:09.291 --> 01:29:11.280
<v Speaker 1>because his waist and his boss were way </v>
<v Speaker 1>too big for that long,</v>

2147
01:29:22.230 --> 01:29:23.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

<v Speaker 1>We just don't know because it's always </v>

2163
01:30:05.611 --> 01:30:08.550
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always embraced in a,</v>

2164
01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:12.660
<v Speaker 1>in a role of soft tissue and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to see the true shape of his head.</v>

2165
01:30:13.170 --> 01:30:15.390
<v Speaker 1>But when you just see skinny Brian </v>
<v Speaker 1>Skinny,</v>

2166
01:30:15.391 --> 01:30:20.391
<v Speaker 1>Brian is a strange dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what nationality he </v>

2167
01:30:20.391 --> 01:30:20.550
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks like he's a fucking alien.</v>

2168
01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:22.870
<v Speaker 1>I'll find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's Kenny?</v>

2169
01:30:22.990 --> 01:30:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Brian?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got to do is we've got to make </v>

2170
01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:30.381
<v Speaker 1>your neck a buildup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This to match your head is very </v>

2171
01:30:30.381 --> 01:30:31.020
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2172
01:30:31.050 --> 01:30:36.050
<v Speaker 1>you can have a big head as long as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a big neck to support that big </v>

2173
01:30:36.050 --> 01:30:36.050
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

2174
01:30:36.050 --> 01:30:39.920
<v Speaker 1>You got a big heads on and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a big neck and that shit look </v>

2175
01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:39.920
<v Speaker 1>strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2176
01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:44.130
<v Speaker 1>that's because that's because your head </v>
<v Speaker 1>is used to the be your body being </v>

2177
01:30:44.130 --> 01:30:47.691
<v Speaker 1>gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you gotta do is you gotTa build </v>

2178
01:30:47.691 --> 01:30:47.691
<v Speaker 1>your neck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2179
01:30:47.691 --> 01:30:48.240
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the most popular things in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood though,</v>

2180
01:30:48.241 --> 01:30:51.720
<v Speaker 1>for actors to have exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want you to have a big head.</v>

2181
01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:54.170
<v Speaker 1>What is that about A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2182
01:30:54.210 --> 01:30:57.060
<v Speaker 1>It's a thing where maybe it's a more </v>
<v Speaker 1>more brains,</v>

2183
01:30:58.830 --> 01:31:01.380
<v Speaker 1>but it can't be true because I know some</v>
<v Speaker 1>people would pick heads or stupid as,</v>

2184
01:31:01.381 --> 01:31:06.381
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a picture of me holding my old </v>

2185
01:31:06.381 --> 01:31:06.570
<v Speaker 1>pants up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2186
01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:08.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not helping the people at home.</v>

2187
01:31:08.970 --> 01:31:11.880
<v Speaker 1>Now I may find a better one and I'll put</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to my twitter later today.</v>

2188
01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:13.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you do,</v>

2189
01:31:13.801 --> 01:31:18.000
<v Speaker 1>I'll retweet it because I know people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are fucking excited to see what you look</v>

01:31:23.431 --> 01:31:25.230
<v Speaker 1>went from being a fat guy to a skinny </v>

<v Speaker 1>Well then what happens?</v>

2200
01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:41.430
<v Speaker 1>Then I settle in and then he'd get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend,</v>

2201
01:31:41.610 --> 01:31:43.380
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gained it all back.</v>

2202
01:31:44.090 --> 01:31:45.420
<v Speaker 1>Never gained it all back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2203
01:31:45.421 --> 01:31:49.230
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably one on one 95 right now.</v>

2204
01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:54.630
<v Speaker 1>One 95.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at least you're still 40.</v>

2205
01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Whatever pounds right away from what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were.</v>

2206
01:31:57.570 --> 01:31:59.410
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get back to one 65.</v>

2207
01:31:59.411 --> 01:32:01.210
<v Speaker 1>That was way too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked like I had aids.</v>

2208
01:32:01.230 --> 01:32:06.230
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't like what you're supposed to </v>

2209
01:32:06.230 --> 01:32:06.230
<v Speaker 1>look like.</v>

2210
01:32:06.230 --> 01:32:07.030
<v Speaker 1>Dude did just so used to sit yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic.</v>

2211
01:32:07.330 --> 01:32:09.280
<v Speaker 1>You did not look like you had aids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swear.</v>

2212
01:32:09.330 --> 01:32:12.130
<v Speaker 1>Never looks like scary skinny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never did.</v>

2213
01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:15.850
<v Speaker 1>It looked weird because like all of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden you were like tiny person.</v>

2214
01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:17.740
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's you.</v>

2215
01:32:17.810 --> 01:32:22.810
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that looks like a healthy </v>

2216
01:32:22.810 --> 01:32:22.810
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2217
01:32:22.810 --> 01:32:23.470
<v Speaker 1>I hate to say that it looks like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy person.</v>

2218
01:32:23.930 --> 01:32:25.360
<v Speaker 1>Your problem is your head's too big for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your body.</v>

2219
01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:27.710
<v Speaker 1>You got to start working out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you started working out to it,</v>

2220
01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:30.190
<v Speaker 1>you'd be a sexy bitch right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're looking sexy as fuck.</v>

2221
01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:36.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a dude that I know that has </v>

2222
01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:37.720
<v Speaker 1>the tiniest head and it always trips me </v>
<v Speaker 1>out whenever I talked to him.</v>

2223
01:32:38.110 --> 01:32:40.060
<v Speaker 1>He has that backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has a tiniest head.</v>

2224
01:32:40.061 --> 01:32:45.061
<v Speaker 1>Every is a very small head and all I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of when I'm next to him was would </v>

2225
01:32:45.061 --> 01:32:45.590
<v Speaker 1>it be like to punch him in his little </v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny head?</v>

2226
01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:48.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never do it,</v>

2227
01:32:49.330 --> 01:32:52.180
<v Speaker 1>but I just think man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you punch this guy and not even me,</v>

2228
01:32:52.181 --> 01:32:55.870
<v Speaker 1>like if a person did punch this guy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>his tiny little head,</v>

2229
01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:58.600
<v Speaker 1>like you could just crush his head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a bird head.</v>

2230
01:32:59.110 --> 01:33:01.030
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather,</v>

2231
01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:04.300
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather have a way big to head with </v>
<v Speaker 1>big two way big too.</v>

2232
01:33:04.330 --> 01:33:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Filled with smarts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My fucking stupid head is smart as fuck.</v>

2233
01:33:09.610 --> 01:33:10.630
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2239
01:33:21.021 --> 01:33:22.510
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's what you look like when you're </v>

2242
01:33:28.651 --> 01:33:28.651
<v Speaker 1>thin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a layer.</v>

2243
01:33:28.651 --> 01:33:30.400
<v Speaker 1>But I don't want to be a gay lesbian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how come you,</v>

2244
01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:32.560
<v Speaker 1>how come you can't stay the same?</v>

01:33:32.610 --> 01:33:35.560
<v Speaker 1>What don't you like monitor your weight </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you see it go up.</v>

2246
01:33:35.561 --> 01:33:37.810
<v Speaker 1>And what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the process when you see it going</v>

2247

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

01:33:42.811 --> 01:33:43.580
<v Speaker 1>it's not even a cut back on food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's a terrible example.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I met it backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the metabolism of fat person.</v>

2266
01:34:27.311 --> 01:34:29.620

<v Speaker 1>could be correct.</v>

2267
01:34:29.621 --> 01:34:30.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's fine,</v>

2270
01:34:35.970 --> 01:34:39.390

<v Speaker 1>Now I don't know.</v>

2271
01:34:40.450 --> 01:34:45.450

<v Speaker 1>things that we're saying about guys who </v>

2273
01:34:49.771 --> 01:34:52.321
<v Speaker 1>gained a lot of weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of times it's just some </v>

2274
01:34:52.321 --> 01:34:54.961
<v Speaker 1>sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hormone imbalance and that it's a </v>

2275
01:34:54.961 --> 01:34:56.020
<v Speaker 1>maybe a testosterone and balance like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cure it with like some cream.</v>

2276
01:34:56.140 --> 01:34:58.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I just get more hairier</v>

<v Speaker 2>not become fat.</v>

2279
01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:10.480
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't get that checked honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I bet you I'm fucking know you </v>

2280
01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:10.480
<v Speaker 2>tired all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2281
01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:11.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired from when I wake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wake up in the morning,</v>

2282
01:35:11.661 --> 01:35:13.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guaranteed.</v>

2283
01:35:13.490 --> 01:35:18.490
<v Speaker 2>And especially because you don't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that forces your body to </v>

2284
01:35:18.490 --> 01:35:18.800
<v Speaker 2>produce it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not involved in any heavy lifting</v>

2285
01:35:18.801 --> 01:35:19.820
<v Speaker 2>or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2286
01:35:19.821 --> 01:35:24.821
<v Speaker 2>I think that's one of the most important</v>
<v Speaker 2>things when you're maintaining your </v>

2287
01:35:24.821 --> 01:35:24.821
<v Speaker 2>health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you get older,</v>

2288
01:35:24.821 --> 01:35:28.241
<v Speaker 2>you have to do strength training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to do cpr training that makes </v>

2289
01:35:28.241 --> 01:35:30.500
<v Speaker 2>your body constantly regenerate tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep your glands pumping.</v>

2290
01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:33.800
<v Speaker 2>When I wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really feel tired.</v>

2291
01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:35.780
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never would have woken up and be like,</v>

2292
01:35:35.810 --> 01:35:37.250
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might have sleep apnea too.</v>

2293
01:35:37.490 --> 01:35:38.810
<v Speaker 2>I probably had that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You snore,</v>

2294
01:35:39.220 --> 01:35:40.000
<v Speaker 2>chicks tell you snore.</v>

2295
01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:45.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever like gagging or sleep or </v>

2296
01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:45.040
<v Speaker 2>don't do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2297
01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:45.040
<v Speaker 2>you should get tested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2298
01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:46.550
<v Speaker 2>I got a new mouthpiece that I started </v>
<v Speaker 2>wearing,</v>

2299
01:35:46.551 --> 01:35:48.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I got diagnosed with sleep apnea</v>

2300
01:35:48.681 --> 01:35:51.560
<v Speaker 2>a few years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one doctor created this mouthpiece,</v>

2301
01:35:51.561 --> 01:35:56.561
<v Speaker 2>it's got Dr Caribbean and Tarzana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They created some a mouthpiece that </v>

2302
01:35:56.561 --> 01:36:00.251
<v Speaker 2>keeps your tongue down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the problem is I have a big tongue </v>

2303
01:36:00.251 --> 01:36:02.660
<v Speaker 2>and my neck is big from working out all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time and my whole that I have in the</v>

2304
01:36:02.661 --> 01:36:04.010
<v Speaker 2>back of my throat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not so big.</v>

2305
01:36:04.190 --> 01:36:09.190
<v Speaker 2>And so when I lie down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like tongue falls back as I relaxed and </v>

2306
01:36:09.190 --> 01:36:10.520
<v Speaker 2>covers over the fucking hole and I gag </v>
<v Speaker 2>and cough.</v>

2307
01:36:10.540 --> 01:36:12.740
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of times it's fat people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fat people have it,</v>

2308
01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:15.050
<v Speaker 2>but athletes have it a lot to anybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>who has a,</v>

2309
01:36:15.100 --> 01:36:20.100
<v Speaker 2>like a big neck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have a big tongue it's probably </v>

2310
01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:20.100
<v Speaker 2>going to happen to you.</v>

2311
01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:20.240
<v Speaker 2>So this mouthpiece kind of keeps your </v>
<v Speaker 2>tongue down.</v>

2312
01:36:20.241 --> 01:36:21.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just invented a new one.</v>

2313
01:36:21.621 --> 01:36:23.480
<v Speaker 2>I just started using this new one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

2314
01:36:23.481 --> 01:36:25.100
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wake up,</v>

2315
01:36:25.101 --> 01:36:30.101
<v Speaker 2>I feel so fucking rested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mrs Rogan says I don't snore at all </v>

2316
01:36:30.101 --> 01:36:34.271
<v Speaker 2>anymore and I feel so much better than </v>
<v Speaker 2>my dreams are super vivid man.</v>

2317
01:36:34.281 --> 01:36:37.550
<v Speaker 2>My dreams are really intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're really like very,</v>

2318
01:36:37.551 --> 01:36:41.240
<v Speaker 2>very lifelike to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes my alarm goes off in mid dream</v>

2319
01:36:41.540 --> 01:36:42.530
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2320
01:36:42.531 --> 01:36:46.370
<v Speaker 2>that was a dream because it's not even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not even like crazy dreams.</v>

2321
01:36:46.371 --> 01:36:47.870
<v Speaker 2>Their dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like life dreams.</v>

2322
01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:49.010
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2323
01:36:49.340 --> 01:36:54.340
<v Speaker 2>it's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have a dream like feel to </v>

2324
01:36:54.340 --> 01:36:54.340
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They feel like I,</v>

2325
01:36:54.340 --> 01:36:56.950
<v Speaker 2>I dropped another level below in my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

2326
01:36:57.020 --> 01:36:59.820
<v Speaker 2>my depth of my sleeping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2327
01:36:59.860 --> 01:37:00.990
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm having these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2328
01:37:00.991 --> 01:37:05.991
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm reaching a rem level that I </v>

2329
01:37:05.991 --> 01:37:05.991
<v Speaker 2>wasn't reaching before because I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>snoring all the time.</v>

2330
01:37:05.991 --> 01:37:10.390
<v Speaker 2>He would choke and I have a sleep apnea </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem because even the mouthpiece </v>

2331
01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:10.390
<v Speaker 2>didn't totally cure it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2332
01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:11.250
<v Speaker 2>it definitely made it better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2333
01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:14.060
<v Speaker 2>But I still snowboard this new one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't snore at all.</v>

2334
01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:18.220
<v Speaker 2>Is that a picture of you and Jenna </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jameson for when she waits,</v>

2335
01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:22.880
<v Speaker 2>but when we were in Arizona.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2336
01:37:22.881 --> 01:37:24.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the goal now?</v>

2337
01:37:24.261 --> 01:37:25.970
<v Speaker 2>You're at one 95.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's your goal?</v>

2338
01:37:26.010 --> 01:37:31.010
<v Speaker 2>Trying to get to win 65.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should get your hormones checked </v>

2339
01:37:31.010 --> 01:37:31.010
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Son might have problems,</v>

2340
01:37:31.620 --> 01:37:36.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can once you can do things to cure </v>

2341
01:37:36.620 --> 01:37:36.620
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things that that works is</v>

2342
01:37:36.710 --> 01:37:38.300
<v Speaker 2>squats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>squats,</v>

2343
01:37:38.301 --> 01:37:42.260
<v Speaker 2>and heavy lifting makes your body </v>
<v Speaker 2>produce more testosterone,</v>

2344
01:37:42.261 --> 01:37:45.410
<v Speaker 2>makes your body produce more growth </v>
<v Speaker 2>hormone is very good for you,</v>

2345
01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:48.290
<v Speaker 2>but you've got to not be pushy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't actually do them.</v>

2346
01:37:48.710 --> 01:37:53.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't seem like the type of dude </v>

2347
01:37:53.710 --> 01:37:53.710
<v Speaker 2>that's really into it just seemed like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2348
01:37:53.710 --> 01:37:53.870
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2349
01:37:53.950 --> 01:37:58.690
<v Speaker 2>the energy I per day is so small that to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

2350
01:37:58.850 --> 01:38:01.050
<v Speaker 2>you looked at it like I feel like I am.</v>

2351
01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:05.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm barely trying nurses and I'm barely </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying not to go back to sleep.</v>

2352
01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:08.040
<v Speaker 2>Jam to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to get yourself checked out.</v>

2353
01:38:08.070 --> 01:38:09.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if you have a real issue?</v>

2354
01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:11.880
<v Speaker 2>But if I've had it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been.</v>

2355
01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:15.080
<v Speaker 2>I've had it my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I've had it,</v>

2356
01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:20.900
<v Speaker 2>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what fucking damn kids get </v>

2357

<v Speaker 2>royally.</v>

2364
01:38:38.161 --> 01:38:43.161
<v Speaker 2>I gave my phone number out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave it to Doug Benson because doug </v>

2365
01:38:43.161 --> 01:38:47.511
<v Speaker 2>was going to come to vegas this weekend </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he wanted to come hang out with us </v>

2366
01:38:47.511 --> 01:38:47.610
<v Speaker 2>at the House of Blues and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah man.</v>

2367
01:38:47.611 --> 01:38:49.560
<v Speaker 2>I said I can even get into the UFC.</v>

2370
01:38:56.630 --> 01:38:59.730
<v Speaker 2>instead of the direct message box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was saying to direct </v>

2371
01:38:59.730 --> 01:39:01.470
<v Speaker 2>message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I tweeted my fucking number two,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And then it just started vibrating and </v>

2374
01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:09.330
<v Speaker 2>five breeding and the calls were just </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming in like they did never stopped.</v>

<v Speaker 2>online and fuck them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2394
01:39:53.301 --> 01:39:54.930
<v Speaker 2>But you were nice about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You take the high road.</v>

2395
01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:55.570
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucked up.</v>

2398
01:39:58.440 --> 01:39:59.580
<v Speaker 2>It's out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2399
01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:04.840
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to take it away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like everyone's going to be so </v>

2400
01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:04.840
<v Speaker 2>cool that no one's going to call you on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2401
01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:09.671
<v Speaker 2>That'd be great to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone was cool because some of the </v>

2402
01:40:09.671 --> 01:40:09.671
<v Speaker 2>people just wanted to call to say hi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why not?</v>

2403
01:40:09.671 --> 01:40:12.570
<v Speaker 2>If you were 18 years old and you were a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fan of some dude and all the sudden he's</v>

2404
01:40:12.571 --> 01:40:15.720
<v Speaker 2>got his phone number online and you call</v>
<v Speaker 2>him and he actually answers like,</v>

2405
01:40:15.721 --> 01:40:18.120
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's most of the calls.</v>

2406
01:40:18.121 --> 01:40:19.950
<v Speaker 2>Most of the calls were people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

2407
01:40:20.130 --> 01:40:22.620
<v Speaker 2>and they were all cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did you go about fate or losing?</v>

2408
01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:24.960
<v Speaker 2>They're just never going to bring them </v>
<v Speaker 2>in now.</v>

2409
01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:30.200
<v Speaker 2>And all these conversations about </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking out of conversations about </v>

2410
01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:31.650
<v Speaker 2>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I conversations about about mma.</v>

2411
01:40:31.651 --> 01:40:34.410
<v Speaker 2>I had a bunch of different conversations</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all kinds of shit and I was like,</v>

2412
01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:35.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to keep this phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>

2413
01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.800
<v Speaker 2>So I kept it as a fan line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to call it?</v>

2414
01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:39.750
<v Speaker 2>I really do answer it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not all the time,</v>

2415
01:40:39.751 --> 01:40:41.700
<v Speaker 2>but I pick it up every now and then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eight,</v>

2416
01:40:41.701 --> 01:40:42.030
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>

2417
01:40:42.031 --> 01:40:42.540
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

2418
01:40:42.541 --> 01:40:43.080
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

2419
01:40:43.081 --> 01:40:43.650
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>

2420
01:40:43.651 --> 01:40:43.980
<v Speaker 2>four.</v>

2421
01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:46.440
<v Speaker 2>That's my phone number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my fam line.</v>

2422
01:40:46.441 --> 01:40:51.441
<v Speaker 2>Now I said that was a real number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that'd be kind of cooler to,</v>

2423
01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:58.860
<v Speaker 2>to actually give out the real number </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of getting another number and </v>

2424
01:40:58.860 --> 01:40:59.770
<v Speaker 2>making it my fan line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like actually kind of cool that you</v>

2425
01:40:59.771 --> 01:41:01.570
<v Speaker 2>actually have my real number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's like my,</v>

2426
01:41:01.650 --> 01:41:04.330
<v Speaker 2>my legit number that I've had for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>decade.</v>

2427
01:41:04.490 --> 01:41:08.110
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's my number eight and that's the</v>

2428
01:41:08.111 --> 01:41:13.111
<v Speaker 2>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This weekend I'm going to be at the </v>

2429
01:41:13.111 --> 01:41:17.910
<v Speaker 2>Ontario Improv with the one and only </v>
<v Speaker 2>Joey Coco Diaz and that's going to be a </v>

2430
01:41:17.910 --> 01:41:19.480
<v Speaker 2>lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ontario is a bad ass club.</v>

2431
01:41:19.510 --> 01:41:21.190
<v Speaker 2>It's selling out quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2432
01:41:21.191 --> 01:41:22.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to get in,</v>

2433
01:41:22.901 --> 01:41:25.150
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of people got shut out in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Irvine.</v>

2434
01:41:25.180 --> 01:41:30.180
<v Speaker 2>I talked to a lot of people that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>disappointed and I'm sorry I didn't get </v>

2435
01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:30.180
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2436
01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:31.990
<v Speaker 2>these clubs they only see like 300 </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2437
01:41:32.110 --> 01:41:34.090
<v Speaker 2>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to come to a show,</v>

2438
01:41:34.091 --> 01:41:39.091
<v Speaker 2>especially like the Friday's shows and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Saturday shows Sunday sometimes a </v>

2439
01:41:39.091 --> 01:41:41.890
<v Speaker 2>little easier because you've got less </v>
<v Speaker 2>people out doing things.</v>

2440
01:41:41.891 --> 01:41:44.020
<v Speaker 2>But Friday and Saturday those was </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking tickets sell quick.</v>

2441
01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:49.500
<v Speaker 2>Irvine was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Irvine last week and every show sold </v>

2442
01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:49.500
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every show was cool.</v>

2443
01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:50.230
<v Speaker 2>People were cool as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was awesome.</v>

2444
01:41:50.740 --> 01:41:55.740
<v Speaker 2>And then house of Blues was awesome too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although I did get a tad too drunk just </v>

2445
01:41:55.811 --> 01:41:58.270
<v Speaker 2>to touch what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unshocked over the line.</v>

2446
01:41:58.271 --> 01:42:00.490
<v Speaker 2>What happened bad because I didn't see </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

2447
01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:05.520
<v Speaker 2>It was nothing bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The show was great but I definitely got </v>

2448
01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:06.580
<v Speaker 2>too drunk and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told the second half of a joke twice,</v>

2449
01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:12.000
<v Speaker 2>but as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I didn't tell the first half of </v>

2450
01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.531
<v Speaker 2>it right the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I tried to like Redo it and then I </v>

2451
01:42:13.531 --> 01:42:13.531
<v Speaker 2>and then I realized as I was saying that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2452
01:42:13.531 --> 01:42:16.220
<v Speaker 2>I already said this isn't that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does that to here,</v>

2453
01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:17.090
<v Speaker 2>do you guys.</v>

2454
01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:19.630
<v Speaker 2>But I just admit it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you admit it and like I immediately just</v>

2455
01:42:19.631 --> 01:42:22.820
<v Speaker 2>stopped and admitted it and just said </v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened and Eddie Eddie's going to</v>

2456
01:42:22.821 --> 01:42:23.680
<v Speaker 2>pointed out and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2457
01:42:23.681 --> 01:42:28.681
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I did it because I fucked up this </v>

2458
01:42:28.681 --> 01:42:28.681
<v Speaker 2>part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2459
01:42:28.681 --> 01:42:29.230
<v Speaker 2>It's not a good enough answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the answer.</v>

2460
01:42:29.231 --> 01:42:30.580
<v Speaker 2>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was drunk.</v>

2461
01:42:30.610 --> 01:42:31.680
<v Speaker 2>That's the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2462
01:42:31.681 --> 01:42:36.681
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying what I did wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the only reason why I did it again </v>

2463
01:42:36.681 --> 01:42:36.681
<v Speaker 2>because I was drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2464
01:42:36.681 --> 01:42:39.100
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have anything to eat and I had </v>
<v Speaker 2>like three shots in a row on stage,</v>

2465
01:42:39.490 --> 01:42:44.490
<v Speaker 2>which is two shots too many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still it was still fun.</v>

2466
01:42:44.951 --> 01:42:47.620
<v Speaker 2>Fucking fuck fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like really happy crowd.</v>

2467
01:42:47.650 --> 01:42:49.480
<v Speaker 2>They were cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam Tripoli was hilarious.</v>

2468
01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:51.940
<v Speaker 2>Sam was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He crushed it.</v>

2469
01:42:51.980 --> 01:42:54.990
<v Speaker 2>It was really good at that place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could go either way.</v>

2470
01:42:55.150 --> 01:42:57.820
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes UFC nights that places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2471
01:42:57.860 --> 01:42:58.450
<v Speaker 2>house of Blues.</v>

2472
01:42:58.450 --> 01:43:00.500
<v Speaker 2>It's just a madhouse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kissed it,</v>

2473
01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:05.550
<v Speaker 2>we fixed it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we fixed it when we got rid of the </v>

2474
01:43:05.550 --> 01:43:06.250
<v Speaker 2>standing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only that changed the vibe of it so much</v>

2475
01:43:06.430 --> 01:43:11.430
<v Speaker 2>because people are uncomfortable before </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you felt that uncomfort from them </v>

2476
01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:15.120
<v Speaker 2>because the fact that they had a stand </v>
<v Speaker 2>and watch a show and I made a lot more </v>

2477
01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:15.760
<v Speaker 2>money than on those shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't care.</v>

2478
01:43:15.820 --> 01:43:20.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't want people to stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it sucks when we saw stand up </v>

2479
01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:22.540
<v Speaker 2>when we saw stan hope rather than shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>cured me.</v>

2480
01:43:23.050 --> 01:43:26.020
<v Speaker 2>No more standup shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll never make someone pay to see me.</v>

2481
01:43:26.021 --> 01:43:29.080
<v Speaker 2>Stand up ever again and we fucked up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Memphis,</v>

2482
01:43:29.081 --> 01:43:34.081
<v Speaker 2>joey and I did a show in Memphis and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>had to be stand up because it was a </v>

2483
01:43:34.081 --> 01:43:37.981
<v Speaker 2>really tiny place and it was a standard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would only see like 100 people and all </v>

2484
01:43:37.981 --> 01:43:39.400
<v Speaker 2>of these people were standing by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bar,</v>

2485
01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:44.500
<v Speaker 2>so half the crowd was standing and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were all talking at full voice,</v>

2486
01:43:44.501 --> 01:43:47.650
<v Speaker 2>like bar voice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like no one was like paying attention to</v>

2487
01:43:47.651 --> 01:43:48.310
<v Speaker 2>the show.</v>

2488
01:43:48.490 --> 01:43:53.490
<v Speaker 2>When Joey went onstage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one was like maybe 10 percent of the </v>

2489
01:43:53.490 --> 01:43:57.311
<v Speaker 2>people in the bar weren't talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just a low rumble and then you </v>

2490
01:43:57.311 --> 01:43:57.311
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

2491
01:43:57.311 --> 01:43:59.060
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the final Straw.</v>

2492
01:43:59.061 --> 01:44:02.750
<v Speaker 2>Never have a standing room show ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not fun to watch fan.</v>

2493
01:44:03.290 --> 01:44:08.290
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the part of what is good about a shell </v>

2494
01:44:08.290 --> 01:44:10.811
<v Speaker 2>as you can kick back and relax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where we'll be awesome is if they every </v>

2495
01:44:10.811 --> 01:44:11.780
<v Speaker 2>fucking place you went had real </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable seats.</v>

2496
01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:14.120
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could sit on a couch like this,</v>

2497
01:44:14.300 --> 01:44:16.550
<v Speaker 2>if that's how you watched a every comedy</v>
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>

2498
01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:18.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kicking back and chilling on a couch,</v>

2499
01:44:19.010 --> 01:44:22.460
<v Speaker 2>how fucking it would be way funnier </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you'd be feeling relaxed.</v>

2500
01:44:22.461 --> 01:44:24.270
<v Speaker 2>She have no tension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're,</v>

2501
01:44:24.330 --> 01:44:27.350
<v Speaker 2>you're more likely to laugh at shit when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're standing.</v>

2502
01:44:27.351 --> 01:44:29.480
<v Speaker 2>Your fucking feet hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sucks.</v>

2503
01:44:30.220 --> 01:44:33.800
<v Speaker 2>First Person I ever heard say that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy Norton and are Jimmy talking about</v>

<v Speaker 2>promoting one of his shows and uh,</v>

2506
01:44:37.090 --> 01:44:38.320
<v Speaker 2>it was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2507
01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:41.330
<v Speaker 2>people were calling in and saying that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they heard there was standing tickets in</v>

2508
01:44:41.331 --> 01:44:42.290
<v Speaker 2>the back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Jimmy was like,</v>

2509
01:44:42.291 --> 01:44:42.740
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2510
01:44:42.741 --> 01:44:43.360
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be,</v>

2511
01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:45.920
<v Speaker 2>this was my show is a standing show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

2512
01:44:45.921 --> 01:44:47.630
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like real adamant about that,</v>

2513
01:44:47.631 --> 01:44:49.010
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't think it was that big of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal.</v>

2514
01:44:49.011 --> 01:44:49.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2515
01:44:49.461 --> 01:44:50.860
<v Speaker 2>maybe he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2516
01:44:51.050 --> 01:44:56.050
<v Speaker 2>he's more rigid with his style or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and he wants to make it like </v>

2517
01:44:56.050 --> 01:44:56.050
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then I,</v>

2518
01:44:56.050 --> 01:45:00.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized that that's the right thing </v>

2519
01:45:00.330 --> 01:45:00.330
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those standing shows,</v>

2520
01:45:00.330 --> 01:45:00.470
<v Speaker 2>they'll stand hope shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2521
01:45:00.471 --> 01:45:02.300
<v Speaker 2>they're fun and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not as fun.</v>

2522
01:45:03.670 --> 01:45:05.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>

2523
01:45:05.171 --> 01:45:10.171
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's my age or what it </v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole time I'm just focusing on the </v>

2524
01:45:10.171 --> 01:45:13.291
<v Speaker 3>pain of my standing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how uncomfortable it wasn't a huge </v>

2525
01:45:13.291 --> 01:45:13.291
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2526
01:45:13.291 --> 01:45:15.100
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like standing up with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>concrete floor when I was 10.</v>

2527
01:45:15.460 --> 01:45:16.510
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't feel good.</v>

2528
01:45:16.870 --> 01:45:21.870
<v Speaker 3>When I worked at gateway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had to do it eight hours and weren't </v>

2529
01:45:21.870 --> 01:45:21.870
<v Speaker 3>allowed to sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2530
01:45:21.870 --> 01:45:24.070
<v Speaker 3>the day that you would find like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>thickest shoes and then you put like the</v>

2531
01:45:24.071 --> 01:45:27.270
<v Speaker 3>best like inserts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not good for you.</v>

2532
01:45:27.271 --> 01:45:28.240
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2533
01:45:28.241 --> 01:45:28.990
<v Speaker 3>your body's supposed to</v>

2534
01:45:29.020 --> 01:45:31.170
<v Speaker 2>be moving around too because that's what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

2535
01:45:31.171 --> 01:45:33.690
<v Speaker 2>Stand up and I'm on stage for an hour </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a half or whatever.</v>

2536
01:45:33.691 --> 01:45:34.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm on four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't.</v>

2537
01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:36.750
<v Speaker 2>I've never hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel fine.</v>

2538
01:45:36.780 --> 01:45:38.670
<v Speaker 2>I'll get off on feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel energized,</v>

2539
01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:42.030
<v Speaker 2>but standing in one place and not moving</v>
<v Speaker 2>at all for an hour and a half.</v>

2540
01:45:42.031 --> 01:45:44.520
<v Speaker 2>That sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's terrible.</v>

2541
01:45:44.700 --> 01:45:45.330
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2542
01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:47.050
<v Speaker 2>you're carrying your weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2543
01:45:47.051 --> 01:45:49.710
<v Speaker 2>you don't even think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not even like moving.</v>

2544
01:45:49.711 --> 01:45:53.130
<v Speaker 2>You don't even get blood flowing through</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and you're right next to other people</v>

2545
01:45:53.250 --> 01:45:58.250
<v Speaker 2>so you can't like stretch your arms out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and move your body and touch your toes </v>

2546
01:45:58.250 --> 01:45:59.820
<v Speaker 2>and shit and unwind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you don't do that,</v>

2547
01:45:59.821 --> 01:46:01.080
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body feels like shit.</v>

2548
01:46:01.900 --> 01:46:06.900
<v Speaker 2>Think it's very important for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the reasons why I don't </v>

2549
01:46:06.900 --> 01:46:06.900
<v Speaker 2>like doing comedy too much in bars </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

2550
01:46:06.900 --> 01:46:09.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't like I'll do it every now and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then just for a goof.</v>

2551
01:46:09.510 --> 01:46:12.810
<v Speaker 2>Just to experience something different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd get a different taste of comedy,</v>

2552
01:46:12.811 --> 01:46:13.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do like a little,</v>

2553
01:46:13.950 --> 01:46:18.000
<v Speaker 2>a shitty little Hollywood gigs every now</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again.</v>

2554
01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:20.760
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's very important that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right atmosphere,</v>

2555
01:46:20.790 --> 01:46:22.230
<v Speaker 2>it has to be set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2556
01:46:22.260 --> 01:46:24.030
<v Speaker 2>the same atmosphere that is good for </v>
<v Speaker 2>music.</v>

2557
01:46:24.031 --> 01:46:25.890
<v Speaker 2>It's not the same atmosphere of is good </v>
<v Speaker 2>for comedy.</v>

2558
01:46:26.250 --> 01:46:27.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your music.</v>

2559
01:46:27.661 --> 01:46:29.550
<v Speaker 2>You could go up and people could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to like,</v>

2560
01:46:29.551 --> 01:46:31.830
<v Speaker 2>how's everybody doing out there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you play your song,</v>

2561
01:46:31.831 --> 01:46:32.370
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>

2562
01:46:32.371 --> 01:46:35.320
<v Speaker 2>You don't require their attention 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent there.</v>

2563
01:46:35.330 --> 01:46:37.530
<v Speaker 2>They're complete interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't require that.</v>

2564
01:46:37.531 --> 01:46:41.250
<v Speaker 2>You don't require a response,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a definite response from them.</v>

2565
01:46:41.850 --> 01:46:44.730
<v Speaker 2>Comedy though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's tricky,</v>

2566
01:46:44.820 --> 01:46:46.500
<v Speaker 2>very tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Setting up the atmosphere.</v>

2567
01:46:46.510 --> 01:46:51.510
<v Speaker 2>So tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's important to go on the </v>

2568
01:46:51.510 --> 01:46:52.920
<v Speaker 2>road would dudes who I think are funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always go on the road with friends.</v>

2569
01:46:52.980 --> 01:46:57.980
<v Speaker 2>It's so important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The worst thing you could ever do is go </v>

2570
01:46:57.980 --> 01:46:59.910
<v Speaker 2>on the road and a guy opens for you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy fucking sucks.</v>

2571
01:47:00.210 --> 01:47:01.950
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't just suck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He likes sucks.</v>

2572
01:47:01.951 --> 01:47:06.951
<v Speaker 2>Like aggressively and like it's like bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>material and it's badly done and totally</v>

2573
01:47:08.431 --> 01:47:11.340
<v Speaker 2>different crowd that you would have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2574
01:47:11.370 --> 01:47:13.710
<v Speaker 2>that he would have normally to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2575
01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:15.390
<v Speaker 2>most of them would never have a crowd at</v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

2576
01:47:15.690 --> 01:47:17.100
<v Speaker 2>The really bad ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2577
01:47:17.310 --> 01:47:19.140
<v Speaker 2>And I've been one of those really bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones by the way.</v>

2578
01:47:19.141 --> 01:47:24.141
<v Speaker 2>I'm not shitting on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's part of the development </v>

2579
01:47:24.141 --> 01:47:27.051
<v Speaker 2>process in writing this book that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing about a lot of my early comedy </v>

2580
01:47:27.051 --> 01:47:31.251
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so making me rehash old bombing stories </v>

2581
01:47:31.251 --> 01:47:35.930
<v Speaker 2>that I forgot of like terrible fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>disastrous tales of the road and they're</v>

2582
01:47:36.061 --> 01:47:37.530
<v Speaker 2>fucking crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2583
01:47:37.531 --> 01:47:39.360
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of it was just because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>sucked.</v>

2584
01:47:39.570 --> 01:47:42.660
<v Speaker 2>I was just terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know how to relax back then.</v>

2585
01:47:42.661 --> 01:47:45.780
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know how to do comedy yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was really just feeling it out,</v>

2586
01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:48.150
<v Speaker 2>which is fine and good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2587
01:47:48.180 --> 01:47:51.510
<v Speaker 2>and it's a thing you have to go through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want people going through it</v>

2588
01:47:51.511 --> 01:47:54.570
<v Speaker 2>before I get up onstage because if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it right before you,</v>

2589
01:47:54.571 --> 01:47:56.130
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it taints the whole room.</v>

2590
01:47:56.340 --> 01:47:59.640
<v Speaker 2>So if someone just came on stage and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just shit into their minds,</v>

2591
01:47:59.670 --> 01:48:04.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you're forced to like clean </v>

2592
01:48:04.670 --> 01:48:06.840
<v Speaker 2>everything up and start from scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to do damage control,</v>

2593
01:48:06.841 --> 01:48:07.230
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2594
01:48:07.570 --> 01:48:09.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So weird.</v>

2595
01:48:09.521 --> 01:48:11.410
<v Speaker 3>It a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know he's,</v>

2596
01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:16.060
<v Speaker 3>I think 20 years old and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's just the nicest guy,</v>

2597

<v Speaker 3>little kid ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2598
01:48:17.141 --> 01:48:19.330

<v Speaker 3>he's always asking for advice too,</v>

2599
01:48:19.331 --> 01:48:24.331
<v Speaker 3>like Ari and me and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a really nice guy and he just </v>

2600
01:48:24.331 --> 01:48:25.780
<v Speaker 3>can't tell him how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just how nice this guy is.</v>

2601
01:48:26.140 --> 01:48:27.900
<v Speaker 3>Did you fuck him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2602

<v Speaker 3>he just said that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He told me the other day that he's going</v>

2603

<v Speaker 3>little open mic young kid.</v>

<v Speaker 3>lead role in a movie and it's just,</v>

2606

<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a big movie.</v>

2608
01:48:42.551 --> 01:48:44.140
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about what it is.</v>

2609
01:48:44.141 --> 01:48:47.180
<v Speaker 3>It's supposed to be like a cloverfield,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's um,</v>

2610
01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:51.370
<v Speaker 3>it's a like at a party with like </v>
<v Speaker 3>generation x guys or whatever.</v>

2611
01:48:51.420 --> 01:48:54.520
<v Speaker 3>Generally it becomes a monster movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How it's recorded.</v>

2612
01:48:54.521 --> 01:48:56.580

<v Speaker 2>it was bad ass was the perfect way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

2640
01:49:58.590 --> 01:50:00.130
<v Speaker 2>It freaked me the second time I watched </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2641
01:50:00.131 --> 01:50:03.130
<v Speaker 2>it was terrible network.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only did it not work,</v>

2642
01:50:03.370 --> 01:50:08.370
<v Speaker 2>there was some dude who brought his baby</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this fucking Mexican dude and his </v>

2643
01:50:08.370 --> 01:50:10.770
<v Speaker 2>baby was making all this noise who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like to,</v>

2644
01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:12.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2645
01:50:13.180 --> 01:50:15.520
<v Speaker 2>so a bunch of people like shushed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2646

<v Speaker 2>and he got aggressive with the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you bitch,</v>

2647
01:50:18.041 --> 01:50:20.320
<v Speaker 2>don't fucking touch me bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

2648
01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:21.220
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2649
01:50:21.221 --> 01:50:26.221
<v Speaker 2>now I have to fucking think about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy and his fucking inconsiderate ways </v>

2650
01:50:26.221 --> 01:50:27.670
<v Speaker 2>and he's got a baby and people trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>shush them and he's,</v>

2651
01:50:27.671 --> 01:50:32.671
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking yelling at them obscenity and </v>

2652
01:50:32.671 --> 01:50:32.860
<v Speaker 2>threatening them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll fucking kick your ass bitch.</v>

2653
01:50:32.861 --> 01:50:37.861
<v Speaker 2>And that kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so now you got to think about him </v>

2654
01:50:37.861 --> 01:50:37.861
<v Speaker 2>for the fucking movie or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was a bad experience</v>

2655
01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:43.240
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really like going to movies </v>

2656
01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:43.240
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So roll the dice.</v>

2657
01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:43.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I,</v>

2658
01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:45.440
<v Speaker 3>especially when nowadays it's like I can</v>
<v Speaker 3>get a blue ray,</v>

2659
01:50:45.441 --> 01:50:50.441
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can wait six months and that the </v>

2660
01:50:50.441 --> 01:50:50.850
<v Speaker 3>experience at my house now is better </v>
<v Speaker 3>than I think going movie.</v>

2661
01:50:51.060 --> 01:50:53.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have a nice good sized TV and you</v>

2662
01:50:53.671 --> 01:50:54.300
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2663
01:50:54.301 --> 01:50:56.180
<v Speaker 2>you've got a good size sound system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plastic,</v>

2664
01:50:56.190 --> 01:50:59.880
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to worry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can smoke weed.</v>

2665
01:50:59.890 --> 01:51:01.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have whatever food you want.</v>

2666
01:51:01.471 --> 01:51:03.280
<v Speaker 2>You can have a comfortable couch to </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch it on.</v>

2667
01:51:03.300 --> 01:51:08.300
<v Speaker 2>It's a way better experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people like the event of being out </v>

2668
01:51:08.300 --> 01:51:08.300
<v Speaker 2>there with other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2669
01:51:08.300 --> 01:51:13.010
<v Speaker 2>people like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things that people </v>

2670
01:51:13.010 --> 01:51:14.631
<v Speaker 2>like about a concert Fuckin Ozzy Osborne</v>
<v Speaker 2>was playing just to you and it was just </v>

2671
01:51:14.631 --> 01:51:16.110
<v Speaker 2>you and ozzy alone with his band in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>

2672
01:51:16.410 --> 01:51:17.790
<v Speaker 2>You probably wouldn't even want to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2673
01:51:18.090 --> 01:51:23.090
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be like maybe listen to a song or </v>

2674
01:51:23.090 --> 01:51:23.090
<v Speaker 2>two and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>

2675
01:51:23.090 --> 01:51:23.130
<v Speaker 2>He's looking me in the eyes and singing </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking,</v>

2676
01:51:23.670 --> 01:51:24.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to look at you.</v>

2677
01:51:24.871 --> 01:51:28.960
<v Speaker 2>You're the only one there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're one of 15,000</v>

2678
01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:30.360
<v Speaker 2>in an arena then it's cool.</v>

2679
01:51:33.150 --> 01:51:34.740
<v Speaker 3>Then it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

2680
01:51:34.741 --> 01:51:36.900
<v Speaker 3>But I think movie theaters need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>reboot,</v>

2681
01:51:36.901 --> 01:51:37.380
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

<v Speaker 2>What makes me even more angry is the </v>

2743
01:53:51.161 --> 01:53:53.540
<v Speaker 2>fact that the opposite is happening with</v>
<v Speaker 2>toy story three,</v>

2744
01:53:53.690 --> 01:53:57.120
<v Speaker 2>because that's the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you're the most angriest</v>

<v Speaker 2>One bad one,</v>

2750
01:54:05.770 --> 01:54:07.490
<v Speaker 2>I think there was one or two bad ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's just like,</v>

2751
01:54:07.610 --> 01:54:09.470

<v Speaker 2>person or are you somebody from a </v>

2754
01:54:16.030 --> 01:54:17.750
<v Speaker 2>different movie studio just being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick,</v>

2755
01:54:17.751 --> 01:54:22.751
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's a lot of espionage and </v>

2756
01:54:22.751 --> 01:54:25.931
<v Speaker 2>fucking double crossing online for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of positive comments as well by </v>

2757
01:54:25.931 --> 01:54:27.320
<v Speaker 2>paid shills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2758
01:54:27.350 --> 01:54:30.590
<v Speaker 2>people have accused the UFC of doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that all the time on the underground.</v>

2759
01:54:30.591 --> 01:54:35.591
<v Speaker 2>People were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many of you guys are paid UFC </v>

2760
01:54:35.591 --> 01:54:35.591
<v Speaker 2>Scheel's as far as I know there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>none,</v>

2761
01:54:35.591 --> 01:54:37.160
<v Speaker 2>but there might be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might just not know about them.</v>

2762
01:54:37.620 --> 01:54:41.040
<v Speaker 2>It might very well be that they hire </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to get online.</v>

2763
01:54:41.041 --> 01:54:43.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's effective marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think about it,</v>

2764
01:54:43.580 --> 01:54:45.170
<v Speaker 2>you get online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hype up a fight,</v>

2765
01:54:45.171 --> 01:54:47.570
<v Speaker 2>you start talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you instigate comments,</v>

2766
01:54:47.571 --> 01:54:49.220
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that,</v>

2767
01:54:49.221 --> 01:54:54.221
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shane would have been knocked out by </v>

2768
01:54:54.221 --> 01:54:56.531
<v Speaker 2>Brett Rogers in or that there would have</v>
<v Speaker 2>been knocked out by Brett Rogers?</v>

2769
01:54:57.170 --> 01:54:59.330
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it is.</v>

2770
01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:04.360
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know in the pride days they used </v>

2771
01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:04.360
<v Speaker 2>to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just a lot of people also.</v>

2772
01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:06.060
<v Speaker 2>That's all they think that is true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2773
01:55:06.270 --> 01:55:11.270
<v Speaker 2>but as far as like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as like putting together threads </v>

2774
01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:15.821
<v Speaker 2>and pushing real positive threads and </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about how excited you are for </v>

2775
01:55:15.821 --> 01:55:16.400
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a good move.</v>

2776
01:55:16.710 --> 01:55:18.170
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a smart move,</v>

2777
01:55:18.171 --> 01:55:19.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get a good thread together,</v>

2778
01:55:19.820 --> 01:55:22.400
<v Speaker 2>I think Amazon reviews or that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2779
01:55:22.401 --> 01:55:26.230
<v Speaker 2>Well I pay attention to Amazon's refuse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That half of it could be total bullshit.</v>

2780
01:55:26.231 --> 01:55:27.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I even try to read it to say,</v>

2781
01:55:27.981 --> 01:55:32.981
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does this sound like something like a </v>

2782
01:55:32.981 --> 01:55:33.050
<v Speaker 2>publicist made or the company made?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one can stop you from doing that.</v>

2783
01:55:33.051 --> 01:55:34.520
<v Speaker 2>You could review the shit out of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>own stuff.</v>

2784
01:55:34.540 --> 01:55:35.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2785
01:55:36.050 --> 01:55:38.030
<v Speaker 2>I've never done that with anything I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever done.</v>

2786
01:55:38.150 --> 01:55:40.530
<v Speaker 2>I've never done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

2787
01:55:41.090 --> 01:55:46.090
<v Speaker 2>I was pleasantly surprised at how cool </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking comments I got on the itunes </v>

2788
01:55:46.090 --> 01:55:50.511
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought when I was going over the </v>

2789
01:55:50.511 --> 01:55:50.511
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2790
01:55:50.511 --> 01:55:53.211
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be a bunch of Douche </v>
<v Speaker 2>bags that don't want to hear us yapping </v>

2791
01:55:53.211 --> 01:55:53.310
<v Speaker 2>about things because this is kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>free form podcasts.</v>

2792
01:55:53.311 --> 01:55:55.860
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times we talk about the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>subjects we've talked about before,</v>

2793
01:55:55.861 --> 01:55:58.080
<v Speaker 2>but they're relevant to the current </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>

2794
01:55:58.081 --> 01:56:03.081
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to assume that each one of these </v>

2795
01:56:03.081 --> 01:56:04.851
<v Speaker 2>to our things is its own thing and try </v>
<v Speaker 2>not to repeat things as much as </v>

2796
01:56:04.851 --> 01:56:04.851
<v Speaker 2>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

2797
01:56:04.851 --> 01:56:07.530
<v Speaker 2>And it's also just hard to remember what</v>
<v Speaker 2>was 28 times two.</v>

2798
01:56:08.100 --> 01:56:12.510
<v Speaker 2>How many hours is that of training?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also think that we get into subjects a</v>

2799
01:56:12.511 --> 01:56:15.360
<v Speaker 2>lot deeper than you can if you just do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it an hour podcast,</v>

2800
01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:17.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to our podcast format,</v>

2801
01:56:17.551 --> 01:56:22.551
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's something about like</v>
<v Speaker 2>really intense conversations or you </v>

2802
01:56:22.551 --> 01:56:22.551
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have these cool conversations.</v>

2803
01:56:22.570 --> 01:56:24.660
<v Speaker 2>You have to let them kind of take their </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking path,</v>

2804
01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:26.290
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes it's like,</v>

2805
01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:28.260
<v Speaker 2>well this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just going to stop it now.</v>

2806
01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:31.530
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just more shit to be talked about,</v>

2807
01:56:31.740 --> 01:56:34.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so many fucking people who said,</v>

2808
01:56:35.190 --> 01:56:36.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things on the itunes,</v>

2809
01:56:36.421 --> 01:56:37.080
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're cool.</v>

2810
01:56:37.100 --> 01:56:39.090
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of complaints about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sound,</v>

2811
01:56:39.300 --> 01:56:41.790
<v Speaker 2>which we did have problems with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sound but we fixed all that shit.</v>

2812
01:56:42.570 --> 01:56:46.030
<v Speaker 2>And if you think it's too low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop listening in on your iphone speaker</v>

2813
01:56:46.031 --> 01:56:47.460
<v Speaker 2>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's low for everything.</v>

2814
01:56:47.550 --> 01:56:51.360
<v Speaker 2>Brian's very upset with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen guys said into how low it was.</v>

2815
01:56:51.361 --> 01:56:55.320
<v Speaker 2>And so today I recorded myself going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Adam Carolla as you know,</v>

2816
01:56:55.321 --> 01:56:58.400
<v Speaker 2>all the couple of them and then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then ours got allowed us.</v>

2817
01:56:58.410 --> 01:57:03.410
<v Speaker 2>This is good now we mean and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the right way to do it too </v>

2818
01:57:03.410 --> 01:57:06.681
<v Speaker 2>because I've heard things where people </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk on lab mix and it's not quite as </v>

2819
01:57:06.681 --> 01:57:06.681
<v Speaker 2>loud or clear.</v>

2820
01:57:06.681 --> 01:57:11.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the reason why radio stations </v>

2821
01:57:11.150 --> 01:57:11.370
<v Speaker 2>use these kind of mix and standup comedy</v>
<v Speaker 2>uses this kind of mix and this is,</v>

2822
01:57:11.450 --> 01:57:16.450
<v Speaker 2>this is the right shit to use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is the way we're going to keep </v>

2823
01:57:16.450 --> 01:57:19.431
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As far as like putting up this green </v>

2824
01:57:19.431 --> 01:57:19.431
<v Speaker 2>screen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of gave up on that shit.</v>

2825
01:57:19.431 --> 01:57:20.870
<v Speaker 2>I think it's distracting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might put up a,</v>

2826
01:57:20.871 --> 01:57:22.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a banner or something,</v>

2827
01:57:22.350 --> 01:57:26.490
<v Speaker 2>maybe put up a big flat screen and have </v>
<v Speaker 2>a constantly changing logo.</v>

2828
01:57:27.030 --> 01:57:32.030
<v Speaker 2>Make you could put together some Nettie </v>
<v Speaker 2>video and will be playing in the </v>

2829
01:57:32.030 --> 01:57:32.030
<v Speaker 2>background.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think could move,</v>

2830
01:57:32.030 --> 01:57:34.140
<v Speaker 2>just show ideas on a toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think I've given up on the idea of</v>

2831
01:57:34.141 --> 01:57:39.141
<v Speaker 2>us being in space looking liquor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cable access show 'em.</v>

2832
01:57:40.170 --> 01:57:45.170
<v Speaker 2>The fleshlight is our only sponsor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the lawyer said before that if it </v>

2833
01:57:45.170 --> 01:57:46.890
<v Speaker 2>wasn't a sponsor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would still tell you to use it.</v>

2834
01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:50.400
<v Speaker 2>Things the fucking bomb diggity me too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>
