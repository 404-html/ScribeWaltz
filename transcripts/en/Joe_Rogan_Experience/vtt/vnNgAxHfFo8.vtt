<v Speaker 1>Two point seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 2>so tom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you recently went on a bike out here.</v>

4
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.710
<v Speaker 2>Sober October is fucking over,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean I got through.</v>

6
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.120
<v Speaker 1>I think the real question is how are you</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling?</v>

7
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.890
<v Speaker 1>I feel great.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>

9
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.950
<v Speaker 2>I've said this ad nauseum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel ridiculous saying it.</v>

10
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.810
<v Speaker 2>One of my funnest months of my entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

11
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.080
<v Speaker 1>It was very educational month for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

12
00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:37.081
<v Speaker 1>it was a learning experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that I really thought that </v>

13
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:38.110
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the exercise and discipline is the super</v>

14
00:00:38.111 --> 00:00:40.480
<v Speaker 1>beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to do something,</v>

15
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.430
<v Speaker 1>restrict something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:43.810
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.360
<v Speaker 1>the fucking class has got tedious for </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of us.</v>

18
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Everybody was like you were saying it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a chore.</v>

19
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.900
<v Speaker 1>Especially like when I went on a trip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:00:52.901 --> 00:00:56.530
<v Speaker 1>like a road trip where I was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>traveling every day to a new city,</v>

21
00:00:56.531 --> 00:00:58.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when I got back I was like,</v>

22
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go like eight days in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>row.</v>

23
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.460
<v Speaker 1>That's what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I finished it off with nine days in a </v>

24
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.460
<v Speaker 1>row.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That kind of sucks.</v>

25
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.050
<v Speaker 1>I thought the Grand Canyon or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The weird thing about,</v>

26
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.660
<v Speaker 1>I knew I was gonna be home for nine days</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

27
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.190
<v Speaker 1>so I planned it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the weird thing about it was that it</v>

28
00:01:12.191 --> 00:01:14.650
<v Speaker 1>was almost like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

29
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.600
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna fucking vision quest or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

30
00:01:16.601 --> 00:01:18.940
<v Speaker 1>I knew that I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I got to that 15th Day,</v>

31
00:01:18.941 --> 00:01:21.280
<v Speaker 1>I was like Giddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was in class.</v>

32
00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:21.930
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

33
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.940
<v Speaker 1>can't believe it's going to go down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as I was starting the breathing </v>

34
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.940
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking at the end when I'm doing</v>

35
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.870
<v Speaker 1>that breathing exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be fucking done.</v>

36
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:29.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

37
00:01:29.441 --> 00:01:33.310
<v Speaker 1>I was really excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did 14 with you guys and that next day</v>

38
00:01:33.311 --> 00:01:34.930
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this shit is over.</v>

39
00:01:34.931 --> 00:01:36.610
<v Speaker 1>And I had four days to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were like,</v>

40
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.210
<v Speaker 1>go for 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

41
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.320

47
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.730

<v Speaker 2>Oddly enough,</v>

63
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:47.990
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't feel like I was done in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird way.</v>

64
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.090
<v Speaker 2>Like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do it every year.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I feel like when I do it once a week,</v>

72
00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:10.741

<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have decent genetics.</v>

<v Speaker 3>started doing it.</v>

84
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:44.170
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's going to die.</v>

<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of people that we were </v>

119
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.970
<v Speaker 3>getting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People were,</v>

120
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm going today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been following you fucking assholes</v>

121
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.920
<v Speaker 3>for going.</v>

122
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.150
<v Speaker 3>And they were trying it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people went with us.</v>

123
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.180
<v Speaker 3>He came to see me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told them I was going to be so I can </v>

124
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.900
<v Speaker 3>take pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what's good about this?</v>

125
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.930
<v Speaker 3>Here's this good about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It lacked all the controversy of the </v>

126
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:31.990
<v Speaker 3>first contest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first contest was like a bat.</v>

127
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.710
<v Speaker 3>There was fucked steaks there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>steaks and has weight to lose.</v>

128
00:05:35.711 --> 00:05:36.790
<v Speaker 3>And at first I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

129
00:05:36.791 --> 00:05:38.560
<v Speaker 3>this one doesn't even have any fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>stakes.</v>

130
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.280
<v Speaker 3>Like who cares if I don't get the 15 </v>
<v Speaker 3>classes or if I sneak a little weed in,</v>

131
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.050
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who cares?</v>

132
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:49.170
<v Speaker 3>You can like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the weird thing is that we were all </v>

133
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:50.410
<v Speaker 3>doing it together and made fun of us </v>
<v Speaker 3>because every time,</v>

134
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.900
<v Speaker 3>every time I got on stage this weekend I</v>
<v Speaker 3>would say,</v>

135
00:05:52.901 --> 00:05:55.030
<v Speaker 3>so I just finished sober October.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would the.</v>

136
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 3>I thought it'd be like saying I just </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrapped fucking star wars</v>

137
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.160
<v Speaker 4>eight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they went in,</v>

138
00:05:59.161 --> 00:06:01.670
<v Speaker 4>opened up square garden ended.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They go crazy.</v>

139
00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:04.610
<v Speaker 4>They were crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They went crazy and then I said it's the</v>

140
00:06:04.611 --> 00:06:09.611
<v Speaker 4>dumbest fucking bed ever because there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>no god damn stakes and if you were to </v>

141
00:06:09.611 --> 00:06:14.590
<v Speaker 4>finish 14 classes or drink,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then the punishment is that we would go </v>

142
00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.590
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

143
00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.091
<v Speaker 4>so like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're that guy you had to host a party </v>

144
00:06:19.091 --> 00:06:21.060
<v Speaker 4>for everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really forgot about it.</v>

145
00:06:21.061 --> 00:06:22.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do remember those ice sculptures,</v>

146
00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.100
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're supposed to get red,</v>

147
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.350
<v Speaker 4>yellow corvette.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where you for leaving.</v>

148
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:29.880
<v Speaker 4>That would have been a lot of fun.</v>

149
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:37.470
<v Speaker 4>What would it have all over it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was going to have things like you </v>

150
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:37.830
<v Speaker 4>think you're funny podcast or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

151
00:06:37.831 --> 00:06:40.100
<v Speaker 4>like you want to hear a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got Joe hit me up,</v>

152
00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:45.101
<v Speaker 4>I got choked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say need a comedian on the Camaro.</v>

153
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:55.290
<v Speaker 4>That was awesome because it was truly </v>
<v Speaker 4>the best part for me because I think I </v>

154
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.660
<v Speaker 4>take this a little more introspectively </v>
<v Speaker 4>at dub.</v>

155
00:06:59.661 --> 00:07:02.060
<v Speaker 4>I doubled up on somewhat therapy and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>

156
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.190
<v Speaker 4>the coolest part was that I was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should have been honest when,</v>

157
00:07:06.191 --> 00:07:07.910
<v Speaker 4>I mean in retrospect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the next day I was like,</v>

158
00:07:07.911 --> 00:07:09.410
<v Speaker 4>I should've never told them how much I </v>
<v Speaker 4>drink.</v>

159
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.350
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't say that now,</v>

160
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.580
<v Speaker 4>but at that next day I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

161
00:07:13.581 --> 00:07:18.581
<v Speaker 4>this has come up bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like people are going to be sad when I </v>

162
00:07:18.581 --> 00:07:21.881
<v Speaker 4>drink.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then you got john daily with like </v>

163
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:35.060
<v Speaker 4>tiger woods watching his trip stretches </v>
<v Speaker 4>his hands,</v>

164
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.480
<v Speaker 4>small Satchel of cash.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was,</v>

165
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:45.170
<v Speaker 4>there was the feeling going into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>month.</v>

166
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.070
<v Speaker 4>To be fair was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

167
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.890
<v Speaker 4>we're all trying to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a challenge,</v>

168
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:54.050
<v Speaker 4>but everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how is Bert Bert doing wholesale?</v>

169
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.190
<v Speaker 4>I got a lot of it about weed and we did </v>
<v Speaker 4>pray for you.</v>

170
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:00.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to</v>

171
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.450
<v Speaker 3>tell you guys that I decided like </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally last minute to forego we'd.</v>

172
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:09.950
<v Speaker 3>I decided to Disneyland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We figured we keep pushing you up until </v>

173
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:10.460
<v Speaker 3>the 31st at midnight on the 30th at </v>
<v Speaker 3>midnight.</v>

174
00:08:10.461 --> 00:08:14.390
<v Speaker 3>I bet she'll come to your senses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just decided some somewhere along.</v>

175
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.350
<v Speaker 3>Not that Halloween that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't even make any sense before.</v>

176
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:19.650
<v Speaker 3>Not at Halloween.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

177
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.670
<v Speaker 3>I remember what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a dentist then.</v>

178
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.860
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was before October even </v>
<v Speaker 3>started,</v>

179
00:08:24.861 --> 00:08:27.680
<v Speaker 3>it was like the 28th or 29th camp and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

180
00:08:27.681 --> 00:08:28.130
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

181
00:08:28.131 --> 00:08:30.120
<v Speaker 3>that was August 11.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will you guys go to Disneyland?</v>

182
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.670
<v Speaker 3>Disneyland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So spoiled in a good way.</v>

183
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:35.870
<v Speaker 3>But we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

184
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.440
<v Speaker 3>w when I decided I wasn't gonna tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody,</v>

185
00:08:39.441 --> 00:08:44.441
<v Speaker 3>but I told Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told Tom like four or five days and </v>

186
00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:46.901
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing weed and they're talking </v>

187
00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:46.901
<v Speaker 3>all this crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just wait,</v>

188
00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:47.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to tell them at the end now </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't even smoke weed.</v>

189
00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:50.450
<v Speaker 3>But then all these people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>commenting and saying like,</v>

190
00:08:50.451 --> 00:08:53.200
<v Speaker 3>you can't even quit weed for a month </v>
<v Speaker 3>while these guys are doing.</v>

191
00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:54.110
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

192
00:08:54.111 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 3>this is a bad example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me just come</v>

193
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.190
<v Speaker 5>out and say it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I just finished,</v>

194
00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:58.140
<v Speaker 5>started talking about it.</v>

195
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.590
<v Speaker 2>Well that was my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of favorites about this.</v>

196
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:07.070
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one was that you guys all joined in </v>

197
00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:08.460
<v Speaker 2>and all gave up something and did the </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenge to,</v>

198
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.660
<v Speaker 2>made it fun and really took an a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the scope off of me.</v>

199
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.550
<v Speaker 2>Like everyone was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can I do?</v>

200
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.640
<v Speaker 2>But it made it fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't make it look like now it's </v>

201
00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:19.640
<v Speaker 2>just burt not drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

202
00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.160
<v Speaker 2>And then my favorite part ever was when </v>
<v Speaker 2>I got that text,</v>

203
00:09:23.161 --> 00:09:25.380
<v Speaker 2>I was sitting naked in bed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>criss cross applesauce.</v>

204
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:27.930
<v Speaker 2>And Ari's tech said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get ready for your comments,</v>

205
00:09:27.931 --> 00:09:29.280
<v Speaker 2>gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going after Joe.</v>

206
00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.840
<v Speaker 2>I've never gotten more excited for </v>
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>

207
00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:38.850
<v Speaker 2>You who don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I posted a video on my instagram that </v>

208
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.050
<v Speaker 2>got a lot of views and it was me jogging</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the woods.</v>

209
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.620
<v Speaker 2>I shot a long time ago and in it I sent </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to each of you and said,</v>

210
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.610
<v Speaker 2>can I green light this?</v>

211
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:46.410
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to post it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it said,</v>

212
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:51.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the machine goes sober with Joe with a </v>

213

<v Speaker 2>no booze,</v>

216
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.640
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe hadn't replied.</v>

217
00:09:56.641 --> 00:09:58.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to post it because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>

218
00:09:58.231 --> 00:10:01.050
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know about the weed thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Ari came out and was like,</v>

219
00:10:01.051 --> 00:10:01.830
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going after him.</v>

220
00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:06.840

<v Speaker 2>I remember being excited because I go,</v>

221
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.640

<v Speaker 2>Joe's not the guy you want to pay into a</v>

222
00:10:11.641 --> 00:10:13.650
<v Speaker 2>corner.</v>

223
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:14.490
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>medicine.</v>

<v Speaker 5>here's this really hilarious.</v>

242
00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:18.060
<v Speaker 5>I didn't have weed for the entire month,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when Ari came to the yoga class in </v>

243
00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.270
<v Speaker 5>Encino and I heard that he was getting </v>
<v Speaker 5>drug tests,</v>

244
00:11:19.271 --> 00:11:20.050
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

245
00:11:20.051 --> 00:11:25.051
<v Speaker 5>you sure you didn't up pretty go into my</v>
<v Speaker 5>brain and go,</v>

246
00:11:26.981 --> 00:11:31.981
<v Speaker 5>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you said you said,</v>

247
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:38.320
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you that I'll take his wheat </v>
<v Speaker 5>test if I can fucking punch him.</v>

248
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.560
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell him I'll take this test,</v>

249
00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.050
<v Speaker 5>but if I'm clean,</v>

250
00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:53.290
<v Speaker 2>the three of us were sitting in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>corner and like,</v>

251
00:11:53.291 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 2>where's red?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's running</v>

252
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:54.640
<v Speaker 4>late.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I go,</v>

253
00:11:54.641 --> 00:11:59.310
<v Speaker 4>I think he went to pick up drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tests and Joe's face when Tommy was.</v>

254
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:03.430
<v Speaker 4>How long has this thing where I go?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking the same thing.</v>

255
00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:04.720
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

256
00:12:04.721 --> 00:12:05.100
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

257
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:06.090
<v Speaker 4>I'll be clean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like,</v>

258
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:09.060
<v Speaker 4>it's like when you land,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like when you land in Singapore and</v>

259
00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:14.080
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know I don't have any because they're </v>

260
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:14.080
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

261
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:14.110
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know I didn't bring any.</v>

262
00:12:14.111 --> 00:12:15.970
<v Speaker 4>But then you start unzipping every.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every.</v>

263
00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like in your backpack.</v>

264
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:18.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>

265
00:12:18.581 --> 00:12:19.660
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got nothing in here.</v>

266
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:24.750
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or like any time you pass a cop or </v>

267
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:24.750
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly what I do,</v>

268
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:25.770
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't take nothing by.</v>

269
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.970
<v Speaker 4>Here's the problem with smoking a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>weed.</v>

270
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.940
<v Speaker 4>I have a really good memory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I also don't.</v>

271
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:37.280
<v Speaker 4>So sometimes weird shit will happen and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>

272
00:12:37.281 --> 00:12:39.180
<v Speaker 4>I'll go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't do that right now.</v>

273
00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:44.080
<v Speaker 4>Like I get weird about like if I see a </v>
<v Speaker 4>cop and that's investigating a break in,</v>

274
00:12:44.081 --> 00:12:46.060
<v Speaker 4>in the building,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would start feeling guilty.</v>

275
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:47.860
<v Speaker 4>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I definitely didn't do anything,</v>

276
00:12:47.861 --> 00:12:50.430
<v Speaker 4>but I don't want to make sure these guys</v>
<v Speaker 4>know I didn't do anything.</v>

277
00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.580
<v Speaker 4>Then I'll sound guilty because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

278
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:56.560
<v Speaker 4>Who the fuck would rob a building these </v>
<v Speaker 4>animals out here?</v>

279
00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.410
<v Speaker 4>Nate Society?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those who wouldn't do that.</v>

280
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:04.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might even say something racist if </v>

281
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:04.440
<v Speaker 4>it's a white guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

282
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:04.730

<v Speaker 6>renovating.</v>

351
00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:10.930
<v Speaker 6>The House has fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It didn't have any air conditioning,</v>

352
00:16:10.931 --> 00:16:15.931
<v Speaker 6>did some windows were missing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of open installation and </v>

353
00:16:15.931 --> 00:16:19.501
<v Speaker 6>he had like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a camp set up in this house and he </v>

354
00:16:19.501 --> 00:16:20.680

356
00:16:25.871 --> 00:16:28.480
<v Speaker 6>see the bubbles in it.</v>

358
00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.020
<v Speaker 6>Let's go drink it all day and his hands </v>
<v Speaker 6>would shake,</v>

359
00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:37.090
<v Speaker 6>but he would do his job.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What have you found out?</v>

360
00:16:37.091 --> 00:16:39.790
<v Speaker 6>He quit and it's actually Jeff Bezos who</v>
<v Speaker 6>founded Amazon,</v>

361
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:42.280
<v Speaker 6>figured it out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>figured it out.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Sparks coming out of his finger on it.</v>

366

<v Speaker 4>That was a.</v>

<v Speaker 4>being sober again,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm totally clear headed and I'm not </v>

377
00:17:24.431 --> 00:17:25.780
<v Speaker 4>side of the hill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just wake up and go.</v>

378
00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:28.810
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I'll stop at the top of the hill </v>
<v Speaker 4>and go for a ride on a hike on runyon.</v>

379
00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:33.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like really great flying sobers </v>

380
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.420
<v Speaker 4>changed my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Although I didn't do it on my flight </v>

381
00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:36.910
<v Speaker 4>back from New Orleans who did trunks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had like four or five drinks,</v>

382
00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:42.280
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that was only because I've got way </v>

383
00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.250
<v Speaker 4>too fucked up on that cruise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

384
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.390
<v Speaker 4>Melissa Etheridge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she doesn't think that she could ever be</v>

385
00:17:46.391 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 4>in a car wreck or a plane crash.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why she thinks that</v>

386
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:55.100
<v Speaker 5>she knows is it creates a reality with </v>
<v Speaker 5>her mind and she gets on a plane and she</v>

387
00:17:56.971 --> 00:18:01.971
<v Speaker 5>says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these people are so lucky on the plane </v>

388
00:18:01.971 --> 00:18:01.971
<v Speaker 5>with me because I'll never be in a plane</v>
<v Speaker 5>crash.</v>

389
00:18:01.971 --> 00:18:04.880
<v Speaker 5>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm that way with AIDS different.</v>

390
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:09.000
<v Speaker 5>Unless you wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The new terrorism.</v>

391
00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:14.170
<v Speaker 5>If some dude running down the street </v>
<v Speaker 5>with a needle just to fucking score at </v>

392
00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:17.151
<v Speaker 5>nate's and it will most likely if you </v>
<v Speaker 5>stay away from needles and weird gay </v>

393
00:18:17.151 --> 00:18:18.990
<v Speaker 5>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to get to aids.</v>

394
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:22.650
<v Speaker 5>Probably that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But like you could play in crashes.</v>

395
00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.750
<v Speaker 5>You can't control plane crash.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

396
00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:26.190
<v Speaker 5>That's so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not even like,</v>

397
00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.330
<v Speaker 5>what is she talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

398
00:18:27.331 --> 00:18:32.331
<v Speaker 5>it's based on the same thing that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>secret and all that law of attraction </v>

399
00:18:32.331 --> 00:18:32.730
<v Speaker 5>steps based on it's based on success.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

400
00:18:32.731 --> 00:18:33.660
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the problem with that,</v>

401
00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:34.560
<v Speaker 5>just being delusional.</v>

402
00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:36.940
<v Speaker 5>But the problem with that is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

403
00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:42.050
<v Speaker 5>the problem with that is you're only </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking to the people that are </v>

404
00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:43.941
<v Speaker 5>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of people that have </v>

405
00:18:43.941 --> 00:18:43.941
<v Speaker 5>similar ideas and they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 5>successful,</v>

406
00:18:43.941 --> 00:18:43.941
<v Speaker 5>so you only,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's you're,</v>

407
00:18:43.941 --> 00:18:45.960
<v Speaker 5>you're dealing with a very shitty </v>
<v Speaker 5>control group,</v>

408
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:47.510
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because you're only going.</v>

409
00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:52.550
<v Speaker 5>It's not scientific.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're only going to the people that </v>

410
00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:54.561
<v Speaker 5>were successful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You talked to someone who just has </v>

411
00:18:54.561 --> 00:18:54.561
<v Speaker 5>perfect features.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Talked to Angelina Jolie.</v>

412
00:18:54.561 --> 00:18:56.250
<v Speaker 5>How do you get so lucky?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why is it pretty?</v>

413
00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:02.450
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was in another dimension and I </v>

414
00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:02.450
<v Speaker 5>imagined it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bitch,</v>

415
00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:03.060
<v Speaker 5>you got lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's got bell's palsy right now.</v>

416
00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:04.500
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So half her face is frozen.</v>

417
00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:10.040
<v Speaker 5>From what stress?</v>
<v Speaker 5>From Bradley Benner and her raising six </v>

418
00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:10.040
<v Speaker 5>kids,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Bell's Palsy.</v>

420
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:16.620

<v Speaker 5>I saw it somewhere.</v>

423
00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:25.580
<v Speaker 5>I'm obsessed with bell's palsy because </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm always afraid I'll get it before I </v>

424
00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:25.890
<v Speaker 5>shoot something big and then just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sorry.</v>

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:29.820
<v Speaker 5>It's the teacher that had had it for a </v>
<v Speaker 5>couple of weeks.</v>

426

<v Speaker 5>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's great.</v>

428
00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:36.900
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever think you'll get to a point </v>
<v Speaker 5>where you realize you're successful </v>

429
00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:40.641
<v Speaker 5>enough where you could just relax or do </v>
<v Speaker 5>you always think you're always going to </v>

430
00:19:40.641 --> 00:19:41.100
<v Speaker 5>be in this place where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>boy,</v>

431
00:19:41.101 --> 00:19:44.190
<v Speaker 5>I hope nothing happens to me before this</v>
<v Speaker 5>bell's palsy.</v>

432
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:45.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I hope.</v>

433
00:19:45.061 --> 00:19:50.061
<v Speaker 5>I hope I don't get sick before this big </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing happens because the thing is </v>

434
00:19:50.131 --> 00:19:51.710
<v Speaker 5>always right around the corner.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what if the thing.</v>

435
00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:53.760
<v Speaker 5>What if you got to a point where you </v>
<v Speaker 5>like Ron White,</v>

<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

441
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:07.230
<v Speaker 5>Do you think he'd relaxed like Ron Ron </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't give,</v>

442
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.410
<v Speaker 5>couldn't be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really couldn't be running.</v>

443
00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:12.840
<v Speaker 5>Follow Ron on periscope.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't give up.</v>

444
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:16.440
<v Speaker 5>He really genuinely doesn't give a fuck </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I wish I could be more that way.</v>

445
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:19.710
<v Speaker 5>I would like he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he came in to do.</v>

446
00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:22.380
<v Speaker 5>When I did a podcast with him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he came in and smoking a joint,</v>

447
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:26.380
<v Speaker 5>smoked it through the entire Bible self,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not in a rude way.</v>

448
00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.380
<v Speaker 5>He spoke the entire joint and then said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

449
00:20:28.381 --> 00:20:31.290
<v Speaker 5>I forgot you're a drinker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then we started drinking Tequila and</v>

450
00:20:31.291 --> 00:20:32.840
<v Speaker 5>now in my head I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my day's wrapped.</v>

451
00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.910
<v Speaker 5>I just drank half a bottle of Tequila </v>
<v Speaker 5>with Ron White.</v>

452
00:20:35.911 --> 00:20:38.010
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to go home and celebrate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

453
00:20:38.011 --> 00:20:38.970
<v Speaker 5>so what are you doing tonight?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's like,</v>

454
00:20:38.971 --> 00:20:43.971
<v Speaker 5>I went with the store and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could never go to the store that </v>

455
00:20:43.971 --> 00:20:43.971
<v Speaker 5>fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like.</v>

456
00:20:43.971 --> 00:20:47.030
<v Speaker 5>And he was totally fine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I see him on periscope and he'll </v>

457
00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 5>just be smoking joints and drinking and </v>
<v Speaker 5>just loving life.</v>

458
00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.870
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can never be that.</v>

459
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:51.310
<v Speaker 4>Um.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In what way?</v>

460
00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:52.600
<v Speaker 4>Why can't you be that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean?</v>

461
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:57.630
<v Speaker 4>I don't like going on stage drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like being out of control </v>

462
00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:57.630
<v Speaker 4>onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what about,</v>

463
00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:02.251
<v Speaker 4>what about the part of like being </v>
<v Speaker 4>content or do you mean like isn't that </v>

464
00:21:02.251 --> 00:21:05.701
<v Speaker 4>what the question was?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can never be component is not a matter </v>

465
00:21:05.701 --> 00:21:08.611
<v Speaker 4>of content.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a matter about worrying about </v>

466
00:21:08.611 --> 00:21:10.420
<v Speaker 4>potential horrible things happening to </v>
<v Speaker 4>you because you're so insecure about the</v>

467
00:21:10.421 --> 00:21:11.230
<v Speaker 4>future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

468
00:21:11.231 --> 00:21:14.620
<v Speaker 4>That's so a wet because I believe that </v>
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

469
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:20.070
<v Speaker 4>My worrying I'm sofa sets up scenarios </v>
<v Speaker 4>for me to avoid those problems.</v>

470
00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.260
<v Speaker 4>That's a good point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was legit.</v>

471
00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:27.700
<v Speaker 4>I worry about a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when I go to do radio I worry about</v>

472
00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:32.730
<v Speaker 4>like what if they asked me this and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>get myself prepared for it and in a lot </v>

473
00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:34.000
<v Speaker 4>of times it's for nothing and I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it,</v>

474
00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:35.200
<v Speaker 4>but my point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you say,</v>

475
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:36.550
<v Speaker 4>are you saying like when you go into </v>
<v Speaker 4>radio,</v>

476
00:21:36.551 --> 00:21:38.080
<v Speaker 4>you're worried that they're going to set</v>
<v Speaker 4>you up,</v>

477
00:21:38.081 --> 00:21:43.081
<v Speaker 4>are they going to be mean to you or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something or maybe it's not always not </v>

478
00:21:43.081 --> 00:21:43.510
<v Speaker 4>always be prepared for the onset can do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

479
00:21:43.511 --> 00:21:45.160
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always prepare for the onside kick.</v>

480
00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:46.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean</v>

481
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.780
<v Speaker 6>it's like a once in a couple of times </v>
<v Speaker 6>over the year or something.</v>

482
00:21:51.781 --> 00:21:56.781
<v Speaker 6>We try it or it's not that common.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a last minute attempt so it's </v>

483
00:21:56.781 --> 00:21:58.380
<v Speaker 6>basically where the incident happened </v>
<v Speaker 6>once.</v>

484
00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:04.020
<v Speaker 6>It's not gonna happen to every game.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's either surprise move what you're </v>

485
00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:04.170
<v Speaker 6>doing once a year or it's like you need </v>
<v Speaker 6>the ball back,</v>

486
00:22:04.171 --> 00:22:07.140
<v Speaker 6>you have 10 seconds left as it's a way </v>
<v Speaker 6>to kick to the other team,</v>

487
00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:12.440
<v Speaker 6>but you can get,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's say very short and you get the </v>

488
00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:12.440
<v Speaker 6>ball back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A martial arts comparison.</v>

489
00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.560
<v Speaker 6>So question mark kick.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

490
00:22:13.561 --> 00:22:14.940
<v Speaker 6>it's more like the one that Miyaki </v>
<v Speaker 6>taught.</v>

491
00:22:14.941 --> 00:22:17.820
<v Speaker 6>What's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Daniel like front kick.</v>

492
00:22:17.821 --> 00:22:19.140
<v Speaker 6>That's only happened once.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

493
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:24.350
<v Speaker 6>Leo Machida.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He did that exact kit really knocked </v>

494
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.360
<v Speaker 6>out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Randy coture,</v>

495
00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:27.030
<v Speaker 6>the grandkids.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He literally did the exact same kick.</v>

496
00:22:27.031 --> 00:22:31.140
<v Speaker 6>He just put his arms in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but Duane Ludwig did put his arms in the</v>

497
00:22:31.141 --> 00:22:36.141
<v Speaker 6>air and King of the cage and Ken Smith,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was beating the fuck out of this poor</v>

498
00:22:37.021 --> 00:22:37.230
<v Speaker 6>dude.</v>

499
00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.240
<v Speaker 6>This is old school when you were </v>
<v Speaker 6>wrestling shoes.</v>

500
00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:41.170
<v Speaker 6>So Shad Smith was wearing wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She,</v>

501
00:22:41.171 --> 00:22:46.171
<v Speaker 6>Chad Smith,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who eventually became the first openly </v>

502
00:22:46.171 --> 00:22:46.560
<v Speaker 6>gay MMA fighter article about him in New</v>
<v Speaker 6>York Times.</v>

503
00:22:46.561 --> 00:22:48.630
<v Speaker 6>A very interesting like super honest </v>
<v Speaker 6>article.</v>

504
00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.330
<v Speaker 6>Very interesting stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he fought dwayne.</v>

505
00:22:51.331 --> 00:22:53.490
<v Speaker 6>He had no business being in the cage </v>
<v Speaker 6>with Dwayne.</v>

506
00:22:53.491 --> 00:22:56.730
<v Speaker 6>It was the early days of MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People hadn't realized that Dwayne was a</v>

507
00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:00.600
<v Speaker 6>boss route and student super technical </v>
<v Speaker 6>striker,</v>

508
00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:03.060
<v Speaker 6>one of the best striking coaches like </v>
<v Speaker 6>today,</v>

509
00:23:03.061 --> 00:23:08.061
<v Speaker 6>like just he coached Tj dillashaw won </v>
<v Speaker 6>the bantamweight title on Saturday </v>

510
00:23:08.061 --> 00:23:08.061
<v Speaker 6>night.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

511
00:23:08.061 --> 00:23:08.660
<v Speaker 6>but Dwayne,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck this dude up.</v>

512
00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:13.800
<v Speaker 6>Dwayne was on like a way higher level in</v>
<v Speaker 6>and these guys were used to in the </v>

513
00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:14.730
<v Speaker 6>middle of the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He stood there and put his.</v>

514
00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:16.770
<v Speaker 6>Did the crane kick and the guy walked </v>
<v Speaker 6>into it.</v>

515
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:17.500
<v Speaker 6>Well look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

516
00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.370
<v Speaker 6>there's Dwayne.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was just,</v>

517
00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:24.410
<v Speaker 6>he was beating the fuck out this guy so </v>
<v Speaker 6>bad that he could have done anything to </v>

518
00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:24.410
<v Speaker 6>him.</v>

519
00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:25.140
<v Speaker 6>See if he could play the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

520
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.140
<v Speaker 6>It was fine to go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just,</v>

521
00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:33.360
<v Speaker 6>it's it preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How bad he beat the students at Duke </v>

522
00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:34.410
<v Speaker 6>Ellington Beach.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

523
00:23:34.411 --> 00:23:36.330
<v Speaker 6>He was like skateboarding with those </v>
<v Speaker 6>shoes on.</v>

524
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:37.820
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was ridiculous.</v>

525
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:40.420
<v Speaker 6>The Guy who's the other guy that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>chance fans.</v>

526
00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:41.880
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He has.</v>

527
00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:44.640
<v Speaker 6>I forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Crazy fancy laces.</v>

528
00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:45.620
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but look at the beating.</v>

529
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.120
<v Speaker 6>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

530
00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:50.180
<v Speaker 6>it's just so wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is done already.</v>

531
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:56.800
<v Speaker 6>So dwayne.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So technically he's never in a position </v>

532
00:23:57.351 --> 00:23:59.090
<v Speaker 6>where he could do anything to him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like right there,</v>

533
00:23:59.091 --> 00:24:02.360
<v Speaker 6>that combination man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this art that left hook to the body,</v>

534
00:24:02.361 --> 00:24:03.170
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Low kick.</v>

535
00:24:03.171 --> 00:24:05.300
<v Speaker 6>That's about as classical Moitai </v>
<v Speaker 6>combinations.</v>

536
00:24:05.301 --> 00:24:08.330
<v Speaker 6>You'd get such a small cage to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But in the middle of the fight,</v>

537
00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:09.710
<v Speaker 6>Dwayne did that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He plays.</v>

538
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:10.880
<v Speaker 6>He's like pitch,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got you.</v>

539
00:24:10.881 --> 00:24:10.970
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

540
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:17.230
<v Speaker 2>Are there extend that analogy than just </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't prepare for the onside kick or a </v>

541
00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:24.090
<v Speaker 2>great fighters?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or is there a fighter that doesn't look </v>

542
00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:26.701
<v Speaker 2>at every option?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I believe there's a lot of </v>

543
00:24:26.701 --> 00:24:26.701
<v Speaker 2>factors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look if I figure if you.</v>

544
00:24:26.701 --> 00:24:31.650
<v Speaker 2>I do that with material where if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just look at every angle and just kind </v>

545
00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:35.221
<v Speaker 2>of obsessive compulsively tear it apart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're never going to be some </v>

546
00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:40.320
<v Speaker 2>surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you are surprised it's you </v>

547
00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:40.320
<v Speaker 2>won't get hurt.</v>

548
00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.500
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And there's no right?</v>

549
00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:43.630
<v Speaker 6>Because there's factors when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 6>fighting.</v>

550
00:24:43.631 --> 00:24:48.631
<v Speaker 6>And then this factor is if you made the </v>
<v Speaker 6>analogy for comedy that you wouldn't </v>

551
00:24:48.631 --> 00:24:51.811
<v Speaker 6>apply to joe ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like one of the things about Joey Diaz </v>

552
00:24:51.811 --> 00:24:54.481
<v Speaker 6>is Julie Diaz just going off the cuff </v>
<v Speaker 6>like a good 60 percent of the time and </v>

553
00:24:54.731 --> 00:24:58.660
<v Speaker 6>he has all these ideas that he can go </v>
<v Speaker 6>off the cuff from,</v>

554
00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:03.960
<v Speaker 6>but so it would almost be like </v>
<v Speaker 6>preparation for joey would be like </v>

555
00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:08.910
<v Speaker 6>detrimental.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like he prep prepares a certain amount </v>

556
00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:11.230
<v Speaker 6>but that off the cuff has got.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's got to live in that moment.</v>

557
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:15.430
<v Speaker 6>That's why you got to see Joey Diaz live</v>
<v Speaker 6>and he's like living in that moment.</v>

558
00:25:15.431 --> 00:25:16.250
<v Speaker 6>Nothing like it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's.</v>

559
00:25:16.251 --> 00:25:21.251
<v Speaker 6>And it's also almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think his best shit is like hanging </v>

560
00:25:21.251 --> 00:25:22.390
<v Speaker 6>around with him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who knows you love him.</v>

561
00:25:22.391 --> 00:25:27.391
<v Speaker 6>Like Tommy when you and I did that </v>
<v Speaker 6>podcast with him when we did the </v>

562
00:25:27.391 --> 00:25:30.280
<v Speaker 6>thousandth episode and the three of us,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we were Tommy and I couldn't breathe,</v>

563
00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:31.180
<v Speaker 6>couldn't talk.</v>

564
00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.310
<v Speaker 6>We had a stop.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We were both leaning.</v>

565
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:34.720
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>under the table.</v>

566
00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:38.460
<v Speaker 6>Their sides.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well Joey was just crushing and it,</v>

567
00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.390
<v Speaker 6>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can't write that down.</v>

568
00:25:40.391 --> 00:25:42.190
<v Speaker 6>When they did,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you couldn't plan it out.</v>

569
00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:44.380
<v Speaker 6>You couldn't take.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't take it to the stage.</v>

570
00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:48.960
<v Speaker 6>He's got to just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's does it in his way and like there's</v>

571
00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:54.210
<v Speaker 6>like there's a lot of power in that too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so like there's a power in like a guy </v>

572
00:25:54.371 --> 00:25:57.010
<v Speaker 6>who has unbelievable athleticism and </v>
<v Speaker 6>power,</v>

573
00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:01.210
<v Speaker 6>like a rampage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jackson who just hit was so powerful.</v>

574
00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:04.090
<v Speaker 6>Rampage and his prime was so goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 6>powerful.</v>

575
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:09.750
<v Speaker 6>And then there's a pen like super </v>
<v Speaker 6>technical and like which one's better </v>

576
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:09.750
<v Speaker 6>but depends.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

577
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:14.740
<v Speaker 6>I wouldn't say I'm texting by any </v>
<v Speaker 6>stretch of the means in any part of my </v>

578
00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:17.671
<v Speaker 6>life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a little bit that it's a </v>

579
00:26:17.671 --> 00:26:17.671
<v Speaker 6>technique to observing your comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like to going over your material.</v>

580
00:26:17.671 --> 00:26:22.560
<v Speaker 6>I think I consider it to be a very </v>
<v Speaker 6>technical thing that over the last like </v>

581
00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:26.790
<v Speaker 6>four or five years I've taken it </v>
<v Speaker 6>progressively more and more serious </v>

582
00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:30.540
<v Speaker 6>where I force myself to listen to </v>
<v Speaker 6>recordings of forced myself to write </v>

583
00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:33.840
<v Speaker 6>bits out and consider all the different </v>
<v Speaker 6>aspects of writing them out and then </v>

584
00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:34.460
<v Speaker 6>consider them as I'm saying them </v>
<v Speaker 6>onstage.</v>

585
00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:39.540
<v Speaker 6>I never did that before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I never did that to about four or five </v>

586
00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:39.540
<v Speaker 6>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would write occasionally.</v>

587
00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:40.780
<v Speaker 6>That's what I did until about four or </v>
<v Speaker 6>five years ago.</v>

588
00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:42.960
<v Speaker 6>I would record my sets and I would write</v>
<v Speaker 6>a case.</v>

589
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 6>You become more technical.</v>

590
00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:44.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

591
00:26:44.891 --> 00:26:46.230
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is technical,</v>

592
00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:48.710
<v Speaker 3>but I'm never going to be as funny as </v>
<v Speaker 3>joey ideas.</v>

593
00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:52.530
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like those moments that he hits,</v>

594
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:53.760
<v Speaker 3>they're different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're different.</v>

595
00:26:53.761 --> 00:26:56.500
<v Speaker 3>There's a different kind of moment and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a.</v>

596
00:26:56.501 --> 00:26:58.410
<v Speaker 3>it's not a planned out moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

597
00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:00.600
<v Speaker 3>Susie says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me tell you something though.</v>

598

<v Speaker 3>that's when I wake up.</v>

599
00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:10.350
<v Speaker 3>Joey would get mad not at me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but about things to me that it wasn't </v>

600
00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:14.001

<v Speaker 6>a baby and they noticed me and I was </v>

693
00:31:29.351 --> 00:31:31.540
<v Speaker 6>realizing it was going to chase me out </v>
<v Speaker 6>of the cave.</v>

694
00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:34.240
<v Speaker 6>Super realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like terrifying,</v>

695
00:31:34.241 --> 00:31:37.300
<v Speaker 6>super realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Super Realistic Wolf Dreams.</v>

696
00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:42.480
<v Speaker 6>Wolves with extra large pause.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They will like these big wolves that </v>

697
00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.840
<v Speaker 6>could run in snow because their paws </v>
<v Speaker 6>were extra large.</v>

698
00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:47.830
<v Speaker 6>They'd like snow shoe pause and I was </v>
<v Speaker 6>stuck trying to run away from wolves.</v>

699
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:49.440
<v Speaker 6>Do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that your.</v>

700
00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:54.450
<v Speaker 6>Is that your go to animal that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 6>let you know that Shit's going on in </v>

701
00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:54.450
<v Speaker 6>your life?</v>

702
00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.850
<v Speaker 6>I've always been obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 6>Werewolf's ever since I was a little kid</v>

703
00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:03.190
<v Speaker 6>because I've always felt like what a </v>
<v Speaker 6>wearable represents is like obviously </v>

704
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:05.971
<v Speaker 6>it's like a fun fake movie monster,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but also the idea behind it is like </v>

705
00:32:06.341 --> 00:32:10.780
<v Speaker 6>everybody is normal and calm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like in most circumstances,</v>

706
00:32:10.781 --> 00:32:15.781
<v Speaker 6>most circumstances you're talking to </v>
<v Speaker 6>people and they're like us just hanging </v>

707
00:32:15.781 --> 00:32:19.081
<v Speaker 6>out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>having a good time talking for the most </v>

708
00:32:19.081 --> 00:32:21.481
<v Speaker 6>part,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but we all know that shit could go </v>

709
00:32:21.481 --> 00:32:21.481
<v Speaker 6>horribly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>horribly wrong,</v>

710
00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:24.190
<v Speaker 6>and when shit goes horribly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>horribly wrong,</v>

711
00:32:24.191 --> 00:32:29.191
<v Speaker 6>whether it's like that church massacre </v>
<v Speaker 6>in Texas or whether it's a fucking bear </v>

712
00:32:29.291 --> 00:32:34.291
<v Speaker 6>chasing you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>things go primal and they go to some </v>

713
00:32:34.291 --> 00:32:34.291
<v Speaker 6>place where you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

714
00:32:34.291 --> 00:32:34.780
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>

715
00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.180
<v Speaker 6>If you want to survive,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have to.</v>

716
00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:40.670
<v Speaker 6>You have to behave in a way that you are</v>
<v Speaker 6>very uncomfortable with.</v>

717
00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:45.930
<v Speaker 6>Like if someone's trying to kill you and</v>
<v Speaker 6>they have a knife and you grab their </v>

718
00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:46.190
<v Speaker 6>wrist and you know that that knife is </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to your chest,</v>

719
00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:51.460
<v Speaker 6>you're going to get to a primal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>terrifying place where you can shove a </v>

720
00:32:51.501 --> 00:32:56.501
<v Speaker 6>knife in someone's neck and cut their </v>
<v Speaker 6>throat open because you know they were </v>

721
00:32:56.501 --> 00:32:56.501
<v Speaker 6>trying to kill you.</v>

722
00:32:56.501 --> 00:33:00.460
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's when the wolf comes out and for </v>

723
00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:03.551
<v Speaker 6>whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the lack of weed made me go,</v>

724
00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:08.700
<v Speaker 6>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 6>grave wolf does like the weed keeps the </v>

725
00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:10.100
<v Speaker 6>wolf at bay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's awesome.</v>

726
00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:13.190
<v Speaker 6>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Keeps a wolf at bay.</v>

727
00:33:13.191 --> 00:33:18.191
<v Speaker 6>In my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm realizing now the more I talked to </v>

728
00:33:18.191 --> 00:33:21.370
<v Speaker 6>psychologists and people understand </v>
<v Speaker 6>neurochemistry,</v>

729
00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:26.380
<v Speaker 6>like my developmental process of going </v>
<v Speaker 6>through high school fighting was super </v>

730
00:33:27.161 --> 00:33:32.161
<v Speaker 6>bad for farm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It worked out really well as far as we </v>

731
00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:37.500
<v Speaker 6>can be compensated for UFC belt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Great.</v>

732
00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:42.320
<v Speaker 6>Fucking devcon three all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Trying to calm it down.</v>

733
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:45.200
<v Speaker 6>I'm always at defcon three,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like growing up,</v>

734
00:33:45.201 --> 00:33:48.080
<v Speaker 6>getting kicked and punched and anger on </v>
<v Speaker 6>alert.</v>

735
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:52.760
<v Speaker 6>It's not just that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like your brain expresses itself in</v>

736
00:33:52.761 --> 00:33:55.880
<v Speaker 6>a different way because it's like I had </v>
<v Speaker 6>violence,</v>

737
00:33:55.881 --> 00:33:56.720
<v Speaker 6>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 6>violence,</v>

738
00:33:56.721 --> 00:33:58.250
<v Speaker 6>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No violence.</v>

739
00:33:58.251 --> 00:34:03.251
<v Speaker 6>Big Cut off,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no more violence and there was no </v>

740
00:34:03.251 --> 00:34:05.681
<v Speaker 6>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like someone coming home from war in a </v>

741
00:34:05.681 --> 00:34:05.681
<v Speaker 6>way.</v>

742
00:34:05.681 --> 00:34:06.110
<v Speaker 6>It's super similar in a way that I </v>
<v Speaker 6>didn't recognize your.</v>

743
00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:11.130
<v Speaker 6>I literally,</v>
<v Speaker 6>literally till I started smoking weed </v>

744
00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:13.630
<v Speaker 6>and then I didn't stop fucking almost 20</v>
<v Speaker 6>years.</v>

745
00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:15.870
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>20 from three.</v>

746
00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:20.450
<v Speaker 6>I'm 50 from 30 to 50.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's almost all weed.</v>

747
00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:25.450
<v Speaker 6>Once Eddie Bravo turned me onto weed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was off to the races because window.</v>

748
00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.290
<v Speaker 6>That was like how long?</v>
<v Speaker 6>When I was 30.</v>

749
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:28.640
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what the last,</v>

750
00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:32.000
<v Speaker 6>it was 1998.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nineteen 98.</v>

751
00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:34.520
<v Speaker 6>Nineteen 98.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Eddie Bravo and I became friends.</v>

752
00:34:34.521 --> 00:34:37.760
<v Speaker 6>That's when I started training John John</v>
<v Speaker 6>to take you a year for you to go like,</v>

753
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:39.740
<v Speaker 6>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll try this stuff right away.</v>

754
00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:43.850
<v Speaker 6>But when you win at being pitched to you</v>
<v Speaker 6>right away or you were like no one has a</v>

755
00:34:43.851 --> 00:34:45.530
<v Speaker 6>crazy way of pitching things as you </v>
<v Speaker 6>know.</v>

756
00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:47.680
<v Speaker 6>Eddie gets very excited about that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But um,</v>

757
00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:52.840
<v Speaker 6>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was more reserved and his ideas </v>

758
00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:53.780
<v Speaker 6>because I don't think he believed in his</v>
<v Speaker 6>ideas as much,</v>

759
00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:54.920
<v Speaker 6>but he believed in weed.</v>

760
00:34:55.580 --> 00:35:00.580
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean by that is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I had to tell eddie that he was a </v>

761
00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:00.590
<v Speaker 6>genius.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

762
00:35:00.591 --> 00:35:02.060
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're a jujitsu genius.</v>

763
00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:03.740
<v Speaker 6>Like I've been around martial arts my </v>
<v Speaker 6>whole life.</v>

764
00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:04.870
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're like a prodigy.</v>

765
00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:05.780
<v Speaker 6>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shit,</v>

766
00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:07.740
<v Speaker 6>you see things other people don't see.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was like,</v>

767
00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:10.370
<v Speaker 6>you're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then we choked out.</v>

768
00:35:10.371 --> 00:35:15.371
<v Speaker 6>Heuler Gracie in Brazil and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I fucking told you bitch fucking good at</v>

769
00:35:17.061 --> 00:35:17.420
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

770
00:35:17.421 --> 00:35:19.030
<v Speaker 6>you knew him during that time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yo.</v>

771
00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.770
<v Speaker 6>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I went with him to Brazil in 2003.</v>

772
00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:26.980
<v Speaker 6>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But from then till now it was like </v>

773
00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:31.301
<v Speaker 6>pretty much all wheat and it changed the</v>
<v Speaker 6>way I think about things because it </v>

774
00:35:31.301 --> 00:35:34.400
<v Speaker 6>makes you more affectionate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It makes you more compassionate,</v>

775
00:35:34.401 --> 00:35:36.230
<v Speaker 6>it calms you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it calms you down.</v>

776
00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:41.530
<v Speaker 6>And then from all the talks with </v>
<v Speaker 6>psychologists and neurologists and all </v>

777
00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:43.860
<v Speaker 6>these neuroscientists,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you realize like the other pathways that</v>

778
00:35:43.861 --> 00:35:48.861
<v Speaker 6>are formed during your developmental </v>
<v Speaker 6>period and one of the big ones is the </v>

779
00:35:48.861 --> 00:35:51.150
<v Speaker 6>period between 15 and 25 because when </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're 25,</v>

780
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:53.760
<v Speaker 6>that's when your frontal cortex is </v>
<v Speaker 6>supposedly formed.</v>

781
00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:56.880
<v Speaker 6>When all your experiences and all of </v>
<v Speaker 6>your genetics,</v>

782
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000
<v Speaker 6>they all come together and kind of </v>
<v Speaker 6>formed who you are to the point where </v>

783
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.610
<v Speaker 6>we've all decided like this is the time </v>
<v Speaker 6>where Tom at 25 can be rational,</v>

784
00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:08.280
<v Speaker 6>whereas before you're dealing with so </v>
<v Speaker 6>much,</v>

785
00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:11.760
<v Speaker 6>there's so much of your consciousness is</v>
<v Speaker 6>in development.</v>

786
00:36:11.761 --> 00:36:16.761
<v Speaker 6>So much of your opinions on life are </v>
<v Speaker 6>distorted by your environment and your </v>

787
00:36:16.761 --> 00:36:21.410
<v Speaker 6>ability to discern objectively what you </v>
<v Speaker 6>should and shouldn't do isn't quite in </v>

788
00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:25.461
<v Speaker 6>place yet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and neurotic neuroscientists believe </v>

789
00:36:25.461 --> 00:36:26.310
<v Speaker 6>that that takes place according to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>people that I've met,</v>

790
00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:31.080
<v Speaker 6>somewhere around 25,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so for me for like 15 to 21,</v>

791
00:36:31.081 --> 00:36:33.210
<v Speaker 6>22,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was chaos.</v>

792
00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:38.810
<v Speaker 6>It was all chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was all head kicks and getting your </v>

793
00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:40.290
<v Speaker 6>bell wronged and watching people go </v>
<v Speaker 6>unconscious.</v>

794
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:43.770
<v Speaker 6>It was all chaos because that's all I </v>
<v Speaker 6>did.</v>

795
00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:48.610
<v Speaker 6>That's all I did from like 15 to 21 and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then so like this and so this says,</v>

796
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:49.610
<v Speaker 6>put that in perspective.</v>

797
00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:54.620
<v Speaker 6>Joy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I remember the first time I watched </v>

798
00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:54.620
<v Speaker 6>someone get knocked unconscious and that</v>
<v Speaker 6>was traumatic for me.</v>

799
00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:55.110
<v Speaker 6>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've seen.</v>

800
00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:58.710
<v Speaker 6>I've seen people get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Think about it.</v>

801
00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:02.640
<v Speaker 6>I've called more than a thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 6>See events more than a thousand.</v>

802
00:37:02.641 --> 00:37:04.270
<v Speaker 6>Really more than a thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 6>More than 1000.</v>

803
00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:07.380
<v Speaker 6>So have people seen people give up?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

804
00:37:07.381 --> 00:37:08.910
<v Speaker 6>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All the nones.</v>

805
00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:13.010
<v Speaker 6>So you've probably seen like $3,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>fights at least apply for the fights.</v>

806
00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:14.140
<v Speaker 6>Fights?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

807
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.420
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

808
00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:19.430
<v Speaker 6>not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well there's only UFC two to 70 a </v>

809
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.680
<v Speaker 6>thousand contests between individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

810
00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:24.010
<v Speaker 6>thousand individual.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Easily.</v>

811
00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:29.070
<v Speaker 6>Easily fights.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you got to think 10 fights for 100 </v>

812
00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:29.280
<v Speaker 6>cards.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a thousand.</v>

813
00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:34.520
<v Speaker 6>I've done more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It feels like you would live on high </v>

814
00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:34.520
<v Speaker 6>alert.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not Good.</v>

815
00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:39.870
<v Speaker 6>Always like keeping an eye on her head </v>
<v Speaker 6>once she was taken something out of the </v>

816
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:43.740
<v Speaker 6>back of the car as the hatch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the thing came down.</v>

817
00:37:43.741 --> 00:37:45.630
<v Speaker 6>Now the accident that come down ended up</v>
<v Speaker 6>point,</v>

818
00:37:45.631 --> 00:37:50.631
<v Speaker 6>got her right in the fucking head and </v>
<v Speaker 6>she was bleeding like blood was pouring </v>

819
00:37:50.631 --> 00:37:50.631
<v Speaker 6>down her head.</v>

820
00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.730
<v Speaker 6>I got a real problem with injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

821
00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:54.150
<v Speaker 6>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's nothing.</v>

822
00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:55.290
<v Speaker 6>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

823
00:37:55.291 --> 00:37:57.240
<v Speaker 6>that's not shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a little tiny cuts.</v>

824
00:37:57.241 --> 00:37:59.430
<v Speaker 6>Only like an inch long.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like my thought is,</v>

825
00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:01.500
<v Speaker 6>unless it's catastrophic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

826
00:38:01.501 --> 00:38:03.500
<v Speaker 6>you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Keep your arms broke.</v>

827
00:38:03.501 --> 00:38:04.170
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>ah,</v>

828
00:38:04.171 --> 00:38:06.240
<v Speaker 6>you got to go to the doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but this little cut.</v>

829
00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:07.260
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's nothing.</v>

830
00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.420
<v Speaker 6>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck is wrong with me?</v>

831
00:38:09.421 --> 00:38:12.350
<v Speaker 6>There's blood pouring down her head and </v>
<v Speaker 6>I've already like.</v>

832
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:15.240
<v Speaker 6>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I'm doing triage.</v>

833
00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:20.500
<v Speaker 6>Like what the possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's the worst thing that can deal </v>

834
00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.771
<v Speaker 6>with it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Deal with the worst thing can happen </v>

835
00:38:23.771 --> 00:38:23.771
<v Speaker 6>with this ain't the worst thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're good.</v>

836
00:38:23.771 --> 00:38:27.030
<v Speaker 6>I wish I had that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No one's bones are poking through the </v>

837
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:28.650
<v Speaker 6>skin way too comfortable with trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Way Too comfortable,</v>

838
00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:33.680
<v Speaker 6>not good,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not good to see hundreds of dudes get </v>

839
00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:33.680
<v Speaker 6>knocked the fuck out.</v>

840
00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:38.630
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Which is similar toward like to create </v>

841
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:40.900
<v Speaker 6>the parallel is like people who have </v>
<v Speaker 6>seen obviously really horrific,</v>

842
00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:42.640
<v Speaker 6>but that's wages.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's different,</v>

843
00:38:42.641 --> 00:38:44.710
<v Speaker 6>but there's a similarity because they </v>
<v Speaker 6>see,</v>

844
00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:48.580
<v Speaker 6>they see people you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>killed or maimed,</v>

845
00:38:48.581 --> 00:38:50.730
<v Speaker 6>and then so when you go like this hurts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're like,</v>

846
00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:52.080
<v Speaker 6>you're fine,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're fine.</v>

847
00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:53.910
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's why it's answer ever talked to.</v>

848
00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:57.790
<v Speaker 6>I had that lady on who won the Moab to </v>
<v Speaker 6>Flores.</v>

849
00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:02.140
<v Speaker 6>Courtney Walter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's amazing.</v>

850
00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:04.100
<v Speaker 6>She's a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's amazing.</v>

851
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:09.310
<v Speaker 6>By more than 10 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 6>10 hours to get into a zone that she </v>

852
00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:17.160
<v Speaker 6>couldn't even see anyone around her.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She couldn't even be like the head of </v>

853
00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:17.160
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's like,</v>

854
00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:17.160
<v Speaker 6>there's nobody around me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Even crazier.</v>

855
00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.780
<v Speaker 6>She won a race while she was 90 percent </v>
<v Speaker 6>blind,</v>

856
00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:25.430
<v Speaker 6>90 percent blonde.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She some sort of cerebral or a retinal </v>

857
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:27.760
<v Speaker 6>edema or corneal edema during this </v>
<v Speaker 6>happened.</v>

858
00:39:27.761 --> 00:39:29.260
<v Speaker 6>During one of her races,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not this one,</v>

859
00:39:29.261 --> 00:39:31.600
<v Speaker 6>but another one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but this was another crazy long one.</v>

860
00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:32.890
<v Speaker 6>And She just kept going.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

861
00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.620
<v Speaker 6>she won and she fell.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bust her head open.</v>

862
00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:38.560
<v Speaker 6>She had a huge gash in her head.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Blood pouring down her face.</v>

863
00:39:38.561 --> 00:39:40.870
<v Speaker 6>She barely could see each stitch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You could only see her feet.</v>

864
00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:44.710
<v Speaker 6>She didn't know where she was going.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She was like literally running while her</v>

865
00:39:44.711 --> 00:39:48.370
<v Speaker 6>contact lenses had some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 6>reaction with her eyes and she could not</v>

866
00:39:48.371 --> 00:39:49.970
<v Speaker 6>fucking see.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And she still won.</v>

867
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:55.790
<v Speaker 6>So when you talk about like tough,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you like to think I can fucking </v>

868
00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:55.790
<v Speaker 6>take it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

869
00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:55.930
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

870
00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:58.130
<v Speaker 6>She can take it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

871
00:39:58.131 --> 00:39:59.740
<v Speaker 6>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how the human.</v>

872
00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:02.540
<v Speaker 6>We're complaining about 15 yoga class.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know that's crazy,</v>

873
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:07.900
<v Speaker 6>but very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She could do it all at once.</v>

874
00:40:07.901 --> 00:40:11.740
<v Speaker 6>We had to like the whole month,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I'm telling you like the people,</v>

875
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:16.660
<v Speaker 6>like people like her can go into a state</v>
<v Speaker 6>of mind that we don't understand because</v>

876
00:40:16.661 --> 00:40:17.660
<v Speaker 6>that's how long did she do?</v>

877
00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:19.250
<v Speaker 6>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Forty eight hours or less?</v>

878
00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:21.680
<v Speaker 6>No more than 50.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So she,</v>

879
00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:23.170
<v Speaker 6>she wants you to realize she could do </v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

880
00:40:23.171 --> 00:40:25.360
<v Speaker 6>And what is it like 58.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Less than 58.</v>

881
00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:28.240
<v Speaker 6>She realized like it would be 58 hours </v>
<v Speaker 6>though.</v>

882
00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:31.630
<v Speaker 6>She completed 240 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Two hundred.</v>

883
00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:36.810
<v Speaker 6>Three official minutes of sleeping.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She just tried to lay down for 20 </v>

884
00:40:37.781 --> 00:40:42.781
<v Speaker 6>minutes and she couldn't fall asleep or </v>
<v Speaker 6>mind was racing and then she took a one </v>

885
00:40:42.781 --> 00:40:45.100
<v Speaker 6>minute nap and popped open toe shoes and</v>
<v Speaker 6>the guy was like,</v>

886
00:40:45.101 --> 00:40:47.380
<v Speaker 6>she was stumbling,</v>
<v Speaker 6>zigzagging across the road.</v>

887
00:40:47.381 --> 00:40:52.381
<v Speaker 6>She could barely stay awake.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the guy that was keeping pace where </v>

888
00:40:52.381 --> 00:40:55.171
<v Speaker 6>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people will jump in the race and keep </v>

889
00:40:55.171 --> 00:40:55.171
<v Speaker 6>pace with you for like 10 miles at a </v>
<v Speaker 6>stretch.</v>

890
00:40:55.171 --> 00:40:58.470
<v Speaker 6>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So when this guy was keeping pace with </v>

891
00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:58.470
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

892
00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:58.470
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's like,</v>

893
00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:58.470
<v Speaker 6>if you want to take a nap,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she goes,</v>

894
00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:59.610
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you got to wake me up in one minute.</v>

895
00:40:59.610 --> 00:40:59.980
<v Speaker 6>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

896
00:40:59.981 --> 00:41:01.960
<v Speaker 6>one minute.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So he wakes her up in one minute and she</v>

897
00:41:01.961 --> 00:41:04.090
<v Speaker 6>was good to go and she kept going.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She said,</v>

898
00:41:04.091 --> 00:41:06.130
<v Speaker 6>one minute she had amazing sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She woke up,</v>

899
00:41:06.131 --> 00:41:07.720
<v Speaker 6>she felt refreshed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She couldn't.</v>

900
00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.660
<v Speaker 6>She was mad at him because she couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>believe he let her sleep.</v>

901
00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:12.310
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I let you sleep for one minute.</v>

902
00:41:12.311 --> 00:41:12.820
<v Speaker 6>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

903
00:41:12.821 --> 00:41:17.821
<v Speaker 6>great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel like the FBI needs to fucking </v>

904
00:41:17.821 --> 00:41:20.110
<v Speaker 6>talk to her earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And she eats Nacho Cheese,</v>

905
00:41:20.111 --> 00:41:25.111
<v Speaker 6>candy candy when she was here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She is a hero to my new hero because </v>

906
00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:25.900
<v Speaker 6>her,</v>
<v Speaker 6>her.</v>

907
00:41:25.901 --> 00:41:27.220
<v Speaker 6>It's her fucking mind,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dude.</v>

908
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:29.530
<v Speaker 6>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no other way.</v>

909
00:41:29.531 --> 00:41:34.531
<v Speaker 6>When you fall,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you're half blind and you hit your </v>

910
00:41:34.531 --> 00:41:34.531
<v Speaker 6>head and you're bleeding,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's so easy</v>

911
00:41:34.531 --> 00:41:35.600
<v Speaker 2>to quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She won't quit.</v>

912
00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:37.880
<v Speaker 2>Excuse now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Won't quit.</v>

913
00:41:37.881 --> 00:41:41.000
<v Speaker 2>Is understandable not to wear shirt </v>
<v Speaker 2>stream by.</v>

914
00:41:41.001 --> 00:41:43.670
<v Speaker 2>Do understand people that go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just got to finish it,</v>

915
00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:45.500
<v Speaker 2>but not to her extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

916
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:50.890
<v Speaker 2>I think at a certain point I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my vision is more important than this </v>

917
00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:50.890
<v Speaker 2>race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you would barely be behind her.</v>

918
00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:51.400
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

919
00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:54.110
<v Speaker 2>You would have been like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

920
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:59.230
<v Speaker 2>I got to be on her heels a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of catch up and I'm running a half</v>

921
00:42:00.681 --> 00:42:03.830
<v Speaker 2>marathon on the 19th of November.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll find out very the little.</v>

922
00:42:03.831 --> 00:42:08.060
<v Speaker 2>No training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You like injuries?</v>

923
00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:09.520
<v Speaker 2>I won't get injured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be fine.</v>

924
00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:14.570
<v Speaker 2>Mickey Mantle over here in Tampa on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>19th after I do my weekend at the Improv</v>

925
00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:18.290
<v Speaker 2>Irvine this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's slow.</v>

926
00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:23.990
<v Speaker 2>Drunk guys are going to pull you from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the trail and lick you in the woods.</v>

927
00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:30.360
<v Speaker 2>You're the hero of drunk man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're the hero of drunk men.</v>

928
00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:37.140
<v Speaker 6>You are just a lot of people love you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Tell you for numerous reasons on the </v>

929
00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:39.760
<v Speaker 6>cruise he got drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hard and a casino and it was the life of</v>

930
00:42:39.761 --> 00:42:44.761
<v Speaker 6>the party on just shared over the head.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought that's sort of a kind of </v>

931
00:42:46.181 --> 00:42:48.040
<v Speaker 6>performance that I don't do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you don't do.</v>

932
00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:50.110
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know and you don't do either,</v>

933
00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:55.320
<v Speaker 6>please.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's like in trying to get you to </v>

934
00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:58.381
<v Speaker 6>conform to a life of no drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Are we removing some of the great </v>

935
00:42:58.421 --> 00:43:01.300
<v Speaker 6>classic American Drunken Theater?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Berta too.</v>

936
00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:05.080
<v Speaker 6>It's not just that like why do we always</v>
<v Speaker 6>think,</v>

937
00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:10.170
<v Speaker 6>why do we always think of performances?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I'm not saying that you're </v>

938
00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:10.170
<v Speaker 6>performing like you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

939
00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:11.920
<v Speaker 6>like you need attention.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not that it's in you,</v>

940
00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:13.540
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It comes out when everybody's drinking,</v>

941
00:43:13.541 --> 00:43:16.300
<v Speaker 6>you're having a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not nothing negative about it,</v>

942
00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:21.600
<v Speaker 6>but why?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why do we classify that as being </v>

943
00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:22.270
<v Speaker 6>different than things that are </v>
<v Speaker 6>entertaining that we go to see?</v>

944
00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:27.660
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if you go to see someone to stand </v>

945
00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:27.660
<v Speaker 6>up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you expect it to be funny.</v>

946
00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:30.320
<v Speaker 6>If you go to class,</v>
<v Speaker 6>go to.</v>

947
00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:33.520
<v Speaker 6>If you go to see someone in a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you expect them to be funny.</v>

948
00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:38.020
<v Speaker 6>But part of what being funny is is like </v>
<v Speaker 6>being able to be funny.</v>

949
00:43:38.021 --> 00:43:40.350
<v Speaker 6>Like you're being funny.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're,</v>

950
00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:44.920
<v Speaker 6>you're a fucking performances.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like when we're drunk at a bar,</v>

951
00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:47.050
<v Speaker 6>those are legit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Totally.</v>

952
00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:49.780
<v Speaker 6>Those are the most fun thing to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>To be around it.</v>

953
00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:52.540
<v Speaker 6>And it's sort of a piece of art is what </v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm saying.</v>

954
00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:54.880
<v Speaker 6>And you got to have a piece of art very </v>
<v Speaker 6>enjoyable,</v>

955
00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:58.500
<v Speaker 6>knows what it's like going to him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

956
00:43:58.510 --> 00:43:59.680
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yes.</v>

957
00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:02.130
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>thank you for managing the room too.</v>

958
00:44:02.131 --> 00:44:04.130
<v Speaker 6>You manage the room,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you bring.</v>

959
00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:05.890
<v Speaker 6>It's authentic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's who you are.</v>

960
00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:11.010
<v Speaker 6>You really should just live at a bar.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They got to come up with a pill that </v>

961
00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:14.510
<v Speaker 6>makes alcohol not bad or a new alcohol </v>
<v Speaker 6>is.</v>

962
00:44:14.511 --> 00:44:17.350
<v Speaker 6>The problem is when I heard that your </v>
<v Speaker 6>blood pressure drops substantially.</v>

963
00:44:17.351 --> 00:44:18.310
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

964
00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:20.980
<v Speaker 6>all I can think of in a bad way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was like,</v>

965
00:44:20.981 --> 00:44:25.981
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What would happen if you continue the </v>

966
00:44:25.981 --> 00:44:25.981
<v Speaker 6>way you did?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And we didn't do the sober October thing</v>

967
00:44:25.981 --> 00:44:30.610
<v Speaker 6>and he just dealing with metro medical </v>
<v Speaker 6>solutions to this.</v>

968
00:44:30.611 --> 00:44:31.980
<v Speaker 6>Are you quitting booze for</v>

969
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.700
<v Speaker 3>a month?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dropped your blood pressure by what?</v>

970
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:36.860
<v Speaker 3>How many points was it 150,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>points.</v>

971
00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:40.260
<v Speaker 3>That's $200,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Record because you weighed 3:35</v>

972
00:44:40.261 --> 00:44:41.530
<v Speaker 3>when we started this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three d,</v>

973
00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:46.560
<v Speaker 3>if he was a pan to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you know what the good thing is for</v>

974

976
00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:55.700
<v Speaker 3>you know for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have no doubt that if you had to </v>

977
00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:56.220
<v Speaker 3>stop drinking for any period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Forest about it.</v>

980
00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:05.540
<v Speaker 3>Well two good experts definitely don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to a real doctors and they were </v>

981
00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:11.660
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need to go to someone who does like </v>

982
00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:11.660
<v Speaker 3>actual research.</v>

983

<v Speaker 3>I don't even know who the second guy is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's said he was on a celebrity reader </v>

988
00:45:19.901 --> 00:45:21.800
<v Speaker 3>app for science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a,</v>

989
00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:23.080
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Stan hope went in deep hard in the paint</v>

994
00:45:33.771 --> 00:45:35.450
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

995
00:45:35.451 --> 00:45:36.760
<v Speaker 3>it's not real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

996
00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:41.770
<v Speaker 3>that's not the way it's supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Healing people with cameras on their </v>

997
00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:41.770
<v Speaker 3>face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nice.</v>

998
00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:44.820
<v Speaker 3>It's not good for the APP,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not good for the actors or the </v>

999
00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:45.410
<v Speaker 3>musicians or whoever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not good for anybody.</v>

1000
00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:49.040
<v Speaker 3>It's not good for people that are trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to understand what their diseases to see</v>

1001
00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:53.270
<v Speaker 3>each other mock like that and having </v>
<v Speaker 3>these mock arguments with each other and</v>

1002
00:45:53.271 --> 00:45:55.940
<v Speaker 3>having these survivors forced inner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1003
00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:01.000
<v Speaker 3>well there's two cameras and two people </v>
<v Speaker 3>arguing by the pool and insulting each </v>

1004
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:01.790
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other's plastic surgery and failures and</v>

1005
00:46:01.791 --> 00:46:05.060
<v Speaker 3>all other divorces to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We set this soda</v>

1006
00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:10.090
<v Speaker 2>now what I like when we started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were having so much fun with this </v>

1007
00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:11.150
<v Speaker 2>Aria and I think were talking on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>phone and he was like,</v>

1008
00:46:11.151 --> 00:46:12.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

1009
00:46:12.741 --> 00:46:14.890
<v Speaker 2>this should be a TV show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then he's like,</v>

1010
00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:19.900
<v Speaker 2>immediately all the authenticity would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be removed out of this competition if we</v>

1011
00:46:20.361 --> 00:46:24.680
<v Speaker 2>did these competitions there are so </v>
<v Speaker 2>genuine and we do get to put them out in</v>

1012
00:46:24.681 --> 00:46:29.681
<v Speaker 2>media for our fans to listen to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you did it with a camera crew </v>

1013
00:46:29.681 --> 00:46:30.900
<v Speaker 2>front of you would never be real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would never be as</v>

1014
00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:36.460
<v Speaker 3>be on a time limit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you have to specifically check in </v>

1015
00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:36.580
<v Speaker 3>now instead of like Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh look at this.</v>

1016
00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:38.650
<v Speaker 3>Photoshop pulling it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>

1017
00:46:38.651 --> 00:46:43.651
<v Speaker 3>part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I think the experience was amazing </v>

1018
00:46:43.651 --> 00:46:47.101
<v Speaker 3>was that we were all like tune.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all locked into a task together </v>

1019
00:46:47.101 --> 00:46:51.100
<v Speaker 3>and took a buddy on new and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there was no official thing to it,</v>

1020
00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:54.040
<v Speaker 3>so we all put posted did number six </v>
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>

1021
00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:56.140
<v Speaker 3>yoga down would make little videos see </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1022
00:46:56.290 --> 00:47:01.290
<v Speaker 3>but it was like photoshops by the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>off the level of photoshop level.</v>

1023
00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:06.340
<v Speaker 3>We have to credit those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I screened saved some of them.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that kills it.</v>

1029

1055
00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:32.680
<v Speaker 1>your car when I went in and I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>well that's good.</v>

1061
00:48:40.901 --> 00:48:42.950
<v Speaker 1>I didn't bring it because then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have seen it here.</v>

1062
00:48:42.951 --> 00:48:47.951
<v Speaker 1>It would have been a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I'm going to leave and as I'm </v>

<v Speaker 1>I'll tell him</v>

1070
00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:03.680
<v Speaker 5>Bali.</v>

<v Speaker 5>so bad.</v>

1072
00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:10.460

<v Speaker 5>That was the dream.</v>

1073
00:49:13.111 --> 00:49:13.500
<v Speaker 5>The dream</v>

1074
00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:16.510
<v Speaker 1>was that the next day I wouldn't reveal </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1075
00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:18.920
<v Speaker 1>And then you pull it into Mazda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right of the store and look,</v>

1076
00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:25.010
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this shit wasn't real.</v>

1077
00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:26.060
<v Speaker 5>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh shit,</v>

1078
00:49:26.061 --> 00:49:31.061
<v Speaker 5>it's fucking morons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The hardest actually</v>

1079
00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:41.760
<v Speaker 1>was second hand comment because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole thing was just to try to get bird.</v>

1080
00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:43.930
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to get burned and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a time,</v>

1081
00:49:43.931 --> 00:49:48.931
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you got in your car and you are </v>

1082
00:49:48.931 --> 00:49:48.931
<v Speaker 1>towards birds car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I turned.</v>

1083
00:49:48.931 --> 00:49:50.130
<v Speaker 1>I was backing up in that car and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really nice.</v>

1084
00:49:50.131 --> 00:49:51.010
<v Speaker 1>See?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1085
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:51.800
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1086
00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:54.800
<v Speaker 5>Lamborghini</v>

1087
00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:56.650
<v Speaker 4>that much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1088
00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:57.980
<v Speaker 4>you still got $40,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>off so.</v>

1089
00:49:57.981 --> 00:49:59.510
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's still $260,000.</v>

1090
00:49:59.511 --> 00:50:04.511
<v Speaker 4>Still a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we started figuring out how much </v>

1091
00:50:04.511 --> 00:50:04.511
<v Speaker 4>money you made the year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

1092
00:50:04.511 --> 00:50:05.300
<v Speaker 4>I know how much money you make.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1093
00:50:05.301 --> 00:50:07.670
<v Speaker 4>based on like just conjecture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're telling me,</v>

1094
00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:12.040
<v Speaker 4>telling already that we started trying </v>
<v Speaker 4>to figure out how much,</v>

1095
00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:14.900
<v Speaker 4>how many weeks you'd have to work to </v>
<v Speaker 4>earn that car?</v>

1096
00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:16.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well this is the best part.</v>

1097
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:18.140
<v Speaker 1>When.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

1098
00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:19.450
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I return it,</v>

1099
00:50:19.451 --> 00:50:20.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>

1100
00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:22.690
<v Speaker 1>I make a video with the guy go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to hold this.</v>

1101
00:50:22.691 --> 00:50:27.691
<v Speaker 1>He was super nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knew about the challenge and </v>

1102
00:50:27.691 --> 00:50:28.120
<v Speaker 1>everything and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to video vertical.</v>

1103
00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:29.830
<v Speaker 5>And like what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The brains blown out,</v>

1104
00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:33.980
<v Speaker 5>the brains blown out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>complaining about the trunk space,</v>

1105
00:50:33.981 --> 00:50:38.420
<v Speaker 5>which is a nice feature that barely fit </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the fucking</v>

1106
00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:42.960
<v Speaker 1>no room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the best part was that when I post,</v>

1107
00:50:42.961 --> 00:50:47.961
<v Speaker 1>I posted it before class number 15.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I posted it and I'm going to take class </v>

1108
00:50:47.961 --> 00:50:49.350
<v Speaker 1>and then when I come out I'll get </v>
<v Speaker 1>comments in August,</v>

1109
00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:52.530

<v Speaker 5>being that guy.</v>

1119
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:16.570

1120
00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:21.780
<v Speaker 1>having lived in Florida for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that analogy is that announces is </v>

1121
00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:26.581
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>

<v Speaker 5>but it's cool.</v>

1129
00:51:52.131 --> 00:51:56.210
<v Speaker 5>Look in detail at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they respond to you guys without</v>

1130
00:51:56.211 --> 00:52:01.211
<v Speaker 5>lying to try to figure out what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when you asked me did Tommy really </v>

1131
00:52:01.211 --> 00:52:02.750
<v Speaker 5>get a Lamborghini?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What did I say?</v>

1132
00:52:02.751 --> 00:52:05.510
<v Speaker 5>I said something to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I fucking danced it like a lawyer</v>

1133
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:12.190
<v Speaker 1>thing was I told you he posted all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>pictures of me in the video but didn't </v>

1134
00:52:12.691 --> 00:52:15.270
<v Speaker 1>post my reveal like my room</v>

1135
00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:19.880
<v Speaker 5>trouble ever again so I can get on </v>
<v Speaker 5>stage.</v>

1136
00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:25.870
<v Speaker 5>I start talking about it and everyone's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everyone's laughing at all the setup</v>

1137
00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:30.890
<v Speaker 1>stuff and then I go and then I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I rented this Lamborghini and there's </v>

<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

1140
00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:35.730
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you're going to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lamborghini.</v>

1141
00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:40.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other best part was this for that </v>

1142
00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:40.820
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right before I posted the video.</v>

<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't.</v>

1187
00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:34.130
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't files your shrink.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1188
00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:35.930
<v Speaker 4>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's happening to us?</v>

1189
00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:40.940
<v Speaker 4>Like what's happening to Tom?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You said you kept saying what's </v>

1190
00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:41.510
<v Speaker 4>happening?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's happening to us?</v>

1191
00:54:41.511 --> 00:54:46.511
<v Speaker 4>The first time he told me he sought out </v>
<v Speaker 4>the truck and he sold out like six </v>

1192
00:54:46.511 --> 00:54:46.511
<v Speaker 4>fucking shows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember.</v>

1193
00:54:46.511 --> 00:54:47.910
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was silent on the phone going,</v>

1194
00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:49.980
<v Speaker 4>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what's happening,</v>

1195
00:54:49.981 --> 00:54:51.570
<v Speaker 4>like what's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Holy Shit,</v>

1196
00:54:51.571 --> 00:54:53.310
<v Speaker 4>I didn't think that was possible for </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys like me and you.</v>

1197
00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:54.980
<v Speaker 4>So then when I saw that I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1198
00:54:54.990 --> 00:54:59.990
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well here's the important thing that </v>

1199
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.000
<v Speaker 4>already said it earlier when he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>telling you to go after me.</v>

1200
00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:01.170
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's no different.</v>

1201
00:55:01.171 --> 00:55:02.820
<v Speaker 4>He's one of us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's 100 percent.</v>

1202
00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:04.320
<v Speaker 4>We're all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1203
00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:09.460
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody who tells you any different is </v>

1204
00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:09.460
<v Speaker 4>lying to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're all the same.</v>

1205
00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:11.040
<v Speaker 4>Everybody that gets onstage and tells </v>
<v Speaker 4>jokes is the same.</v>

1206
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:16.190
<v Speaker 4>How far you get through the maze has </v>
<v Speaker 4>zero bearing on whether or not you're a </v>

1207
00:55:17.071 --> 00:55:19.770
<v Speaker 4>real comic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you see Tom doing it,</v>

1208
00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:24.800
<v Speaker 4>you could do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That thing that keeps you worried about </v>

1209
00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:27.591
<v Speaker 4>bell's palsy is the same thing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>keeps you freaking out about like </v>

1210
00:55:27.591 --> 00:55:30.090
<v Speaker 4>whether or not your real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all the same thing.</v>

1211
00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:32.390
<v Speaker 4>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you see him get something like I</v>

1212
00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:35.010
<v Speaker 4>got to get something to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got to get a reward to show that.</v>

1213
00:55:35.011 --> 00:55:37.800
<v Speaker 4>I'm like right here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to keep up with it.</v>

1214
00:55:37.890 --> 00:55:40.770
<v Speaker 4>But it's like everyone's getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>presence.</v>

1215
00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:44.010
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're only doing it because he has.</v>

1216
00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:45.000
<v Speaker 4>If he had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're right.</v>

1217
00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:50.060
<v Speaker 4>It had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he had not shown up with a fucking </v>

1218
00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:51.330
<v Speaker 4>Lamborghini to yoga class motorcycle </v>
<v Speaker 4>2017.</v>

1219
00:55:51.331 --> 00:55:55.930
<v Speaker 4>Who had I done?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

1220
00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:02.960
<v Speaker 4>this is the part I didn't expect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which was the part that was not thought </v>

1221
00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:02.960
<v Speaker 4>about in the prank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing was just like,</v>

1222
00:56:03.030 --> 00:56:07.500
<v Speaker 4>just get to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happened was all the people,</v>

1223
00:56:07.501 --> 00:56:09.810
<v Speaker 4>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>comments can be like sad,</v>

1224
00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:10.470
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1225
00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:13.230
<v Speaker 4>everything is like fuck you or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you know,</v>

1226
00:56:13.231 --> 00:56:16.320
<v Speaker 4>it can be really negative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can Be for sure.</v>

1227
00:56:16.321 --> 00:56:21.321
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't tell you how many people were </v>

1228
00:56:21.321 --> 00:56:21.321

<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

1230
00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

1231
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:25.870
<v Speaker 6>then some people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>really lost the fan.</v>

1232
00:56:26.370 --> 00:56:27.880

<v Speaker 6>are done with me.</v>

1238
00:56:39.070 --> 00:56:42.100

<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

<v Speaker 6>very many of those like environments </v>

1245
00:57:04.590 --> 00:57:08.161
<v Speaker 6>where someone can do something that </v>
<v Speaker 6>makes other people happy over long </v>

<v Speaker 6>periods of time,</v>

<v Speaker 6>it's just a part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't.</v>

1266
00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:07.510
<v Speaker 6>I thought people were all going to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

1267
00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:10.120
<v Speaker 6>you're a fucking piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Which there were a few,</v>

1268
00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:15.150
<v Speaker 6>but most people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the majority of the comments were like </v>

1269
00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:15.150
<v Speaker 6>way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Way to go.</v>

1270
00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:16.360
<v Speaker 6>That's so great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's possible,</v>

1271
00:58:16.361 --> 00:58:17.980
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's all possible.</v>

1272
00:58:18.010 --> 00:58:23.010
<v Speaker 6>The reason why people get aggressive and</v>
<v Speaker 6>angry because they feel like they're on </v>

1273
00:58:23.010 --> 00:58:25.591
<v Speaker 6>the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They feel like they can never get </v>

1274
00:58:25.591 --> 00:58:25.591
<v Speaker 6>inside.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're angry.</v>

1275
00:58:25.591 --> 00:58:26.290
<v Speaker 6>They're on the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're all on the inside.</v>

1276
00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:28.630
<v Speaker 6>It's like a perception that keeps you on</v>
<v Speaker 6>the outside.</v>

1277
00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:29.620
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's true.</v>

1278
00:58:29.650 --> 00:58:33.890
<v Speaker 6>It's all perception and to this day I.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Every time I,</v>

1279
00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:36.280
<v Speaker 6>my name gets like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like ladies and gentleman,</v>

1280
00:58:36.281 --> 00:58:37.540
<v Speaker 6>Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I fucking go,</v>

1281
00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:40.330
<v Speaker 6>what are you even doing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You even know what the fuck you're doing</v>

1282
00:58:40.450 --> 00:58:41.650
<v Speaker 6>like to this day.</v>

1283
00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:44.380
<v Speaker 6>So he didn't let us in is pretty nuts </v>
<v Speaker 6>to.</v>

1284
00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:46.010
<v Speaker 6>Doesn't seem right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It didn't seem.</v>

1285
00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:51.460
<v Speaker 6>It was a stage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I did the theater at Madison Square </v>

1286
00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:51.460
<v Speaker 6>Gardens.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like 6,000</v>

1287
00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:52.420
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's insane.</v>

1288
00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:58.430
<v Speaker 6>It feels so scary.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like before you're about to understand </v>

1289
00:58:59.801 --> 00:59:03.460
<v Speaker 6>how we hear first time you told me you </v>
<v Speaker 6>did a 6,000</v>

1290
00:59:03.461 --> 00:59:06.160
<v Speaker 6>seater and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was in a traffic jam and I said to the</v>

1291
00:59:06.161 --> 00:59:08.560
<v Speaker 6>driver what's all this traffic for?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he was like,</v>

1292
00:59:08.561 --> 00:59:13.561
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a big show of it was me and Tony</v>

1293
00:59:15.730 --> 00:59:18.580
<v Speaker 6>Hinchcliffe and Ian Edwards.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're headed to this,</v>

1294
00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:21.710
<v Speaker 6>this big giant ass fucking theater </v>
<v Speaker 6>Dallas,</v>

1295
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:24.800
<v Speaker 6>6,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>seats and as we're pulling up a god damn</v>

1296
00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:28.700
<v Speaker 6>fucking traffic and then we realized we </v>
<v Speaker 6>were stuck in my traffic.</v>

1297
00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:33.800
<v Speaker 6>This is nerve wracking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but don't you a nine slash 11 of comedy?</v>

1298
00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:36.350
<v Speaker 6>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's nerve wracking,</v>

1299
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:41.470
<v Speaker 6>but I think the reason I am the way I am</v>
<v Speaker 6>with a little bit of all unimpressed,</v>

1300
00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:49.120
<v Speaker 6>like on both of those stories,</v>
<v Speaker 6>would you rather me be real in those </v>

1301
00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:50.090
<v Speaker 6>moments that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the hell?</v>

1302
00:59:50.140 --> 00:59:52.460
<v Speaker 6>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let me get one of those.</v>

1303
00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:57.440
<v Speaker 6>Give me two years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>$10,000</v>

1304
00:59:57.441 --> 01:00:02.441
<v Speaker 6>off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Better than bigger than Louis in five </v>

1305
01:00:02.441 --> 01:00:03.731
<v Speaker 6>years for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1306
01:00:04.401 --> 01:00:06.590
<v Speaker 6>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No one's criticizing who you are.</v>

1307
01:00:06.910 --> 01:00:11.910
<v Speaker 6>We just sometimes you need to see from </v>
<v Speaker 6>someone else's perspective because you </v>

1308
01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:16.031
<v Speaker 6>don't even realize like you might have </v>
<v Speaker 6>these little roadblocks he keep bumping </v>

1309
01:00:16.031 --> 01:00:16.031
<v Speaker 6>into and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey man,</v>

1310
01:00:16.031 --> 01:00:20.931
<v Speaker 6>I used to go around that bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't even realize like people </v>

1311
01:00:20.931 --> 01:00:22.550
<v Speaker 6>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You run into like one or two people that</v>

1312
01:00:22.551 --> 01:00:24.170
<v Speaker 6>want you to fail.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Guess what?</v>

1313
01:00:24.171 --> 01:00:26.390
<v Speaker 6>Those people don't even really want you </v>
<v Speaker 6>to fail.</v>

1314
01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:28.060
<v Speaker 6>They just don't feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1315
01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:33.140
<v Speaker 6>They're mad at you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They look at anybody who doesn't want </v>

1316
01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:34.010
<v Speaker 6>someone to do well.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If I see someone that's a total fuck up,</v>

1317
01:00:34.011 --> 01:00:39.011
<v Speaker 6>I want them to do better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't have to just be better for </v>

1318
01:00:39.011 --> 01:00:39.470
<v Speaker 6>me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Positive way.</v>

1319
01:00:39.471 --> 01:00:44.471
<v Speaker 6>If they're better,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it affects me in a negative way if they </v>

1320
01:00:44.471 --> 01:00:44.471
<v Speaker 6>fail,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that.</v>

1321
01:00:44.471 --> 01:00:48.980
<v Speaker 6>So you're running into people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a bad sample like you're running </v>

1322
01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:51.380
<v Speaker 6>into people like so often when you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>paying attention to social media,</v>

1323
01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:56.590
<v Speaker 6>you're running into people that are </v>
<v Speaker 6>judging you because of their own </v>

1324
01:00:56.590 --> 01:00:56.590
<v Speaker 6>feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1325
01:00:56.590 --> 01:00:57.170
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's true.</v>

1326
01:00:57.260 --> 01:01:00.110
<v Speaker 6>And that affects you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It affects the way you think and the way</v>

1327
01:01:00.111 --> 01:01:02.480
<v Speaker 6>you think about the word.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Try not to engage every engaged.</v>

1328
01:01:02.481 --> 01:01:04.310
<v Speaker 6>Really the negativity.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's you can't,</v>

1329
01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:05.960
<v Speaker 6>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You encourage it.</v>

1330
01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:09.650
<v Speaker 6>And there's people that feed off of it </v>
<v Speaker 6>and on both sides,</v>

1331
01:01:10.050 --> 01:01:11.900
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like there's like Owen Benjamin,</v>

1332
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.310
<v Speaker 6>I gotta text them just fucking fighting </v>
<v Speaker 6>with people online.</v>

1333
01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:17.050
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's been on.</v>

1334
01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:19.230
<v Speaker 6>He's a fucking smart dude too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1335
01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:21.110
<v Speaker 6>he's smart,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he's caught up in that,</v>

1336
01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:26.200
<v Speaker 6>that weirdness of like get out of there </v>
<v Speaker 6>and just kept walking and he does a lot </v>

1337
01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:28.070
<v Speaker 6>of that too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He does build fires and sit out.</v>

1338
01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:30.770
<v Speaker 6>He does that too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did you guys see Jamie Kilstein?</v>

1339
01:01:31.350 --> 01:01:31.830
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's totally.</v>

1340
01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:35.300
<v Speaker 6>I saw them and feed them here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had him here for two and a half hours.</v>

1341
01:01:35.330 --> 01:01:37.870
<v Speaker 6>You really think I did not listen to </v>
<v Speaker 6>that whole weight.</v>

1342
01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:43.100
<v Speaker 6>Was that that was a response to the one </v>
<v Speaker 6>or are you saying this is a separate </v>

1343
01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:43.100
<v Speaker 6>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Separate one recently?</v>

1344
01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:44.210
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I'm saying what you know,</v>

1345
01:01:44.211 --> 01:01:48.590
<v Speaker 6>his whole thing was that he was this guy</v>
<v Speaker 6>who was attacking people online.</v>

1346
01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:53.770
<v Speaker 6>Jamie was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jamie was like a full on social justice </v>

1347
01:01:53.770 --> 01:01:54.680
<v Speaker 6>warrior,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Vegan,</v>

1348
01:01:55.070 --> 01:01:57.020
<v Speaker 6>Vegan warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's not anymore.</v>

1349
01:01:57.050 --> 01:01:58.190
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1350
01:01:58.191 --> 01:02:00.020
<v Speaker 6>you don't know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have no idea.</v>

1351
01:02:00.110 --> 01:02:01.400
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a crazy story.</v>

1352
01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:06.970
<v Speaker 6>Who's been molesting children separated </v>
<v Speaker 6>from his girlfriend or his wife rather </v>

1353
01:02:06.970 --> 01:02:11.650
<v Speaker 6>than some sort of a open situation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And during that open situation he had </v>

1354
01:02:11.650 --> 01:02:16.360
<v Speaker 6>had sex with a couple of the girls and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they decided that he wasn't some way </v>

1355
01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:16.370
<v Speaker 6>predatory.</v>

1356
01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:21.520
<v Speaker 6>Who's right and who's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not going to engage in because I do </v>

1357
01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:23.220
<v Speaker 6>not know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would hope that,</v>

1358
01:02:23.221 --> 01:02:25.860
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a bunch of misunderstandings.</v>

1359
01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:31.040
<v Speaker 6>I hope that he didn't do anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 6>and they didn't lie about him doing </v>

1360
01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:31.040
<v Speaker 6>something wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he didn't.</v>

1361
01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:32.370
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know really what happened,</v>

1362
01:02:32.790 --> 01:02:37.790
<v Speaker 6>but what he talked about that was honest</v>
<v Speaker 6>was about how he would feel going after </v>

1363
01:02:37.790 --> 01:02:39.900
<v Speaker 6>people trying to get people fired.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He would feel good.</v>

1364
01:02:40.170 --> 01:02:40.980
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you feel good,</v>

1365
01:02:40.981 --> 01:02:43.890
<v Speaker 6>you feel fired up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he would also feel engaged and,</v>

1366
01:02:43.930 --> 01:02:45.540
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and part of it was like,</v>

1367
01:02:45.541 --> 01:02:47.910
<v Speaker 6>you're terrified of other people coming </v>
<v Speaker 6>after you,</v>

1368
01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:52.590
<v Speaker 6>so you're going to go after the show </v>
<v Speaker 6>your virtue and attack and that,</v>

1369
01:02:52.591 --> 01:02:57.591
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was just so caught up in it that he </v>

1370
01:02:57.591 --> 01:02:57.591
<v Speaker 6>wasn't even like looking at stories </v>
<v Speaker 6>objective,</v>

1371
01:02:57.591 --> 01:02:58.460
<v Speaker 6>Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was like,</v>

1372
01:02:58.510 --> 01:03:03.510
<v Speaker 6>it's like finding a direction that he </v>
<v Speaker 6>should definitely go into to get the </v>

1373
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:04.770
<v Speaker 6>most reaction from all these people that</v>
<v Speaker 6>are supporting this direction.</v>

1374
01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:08.330
<v Speaker 5>MMM.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Comics who already goes after who?</v>

1375
01:03:08.331 --> 01:03:10.880
<v Speaker 5>Just posts statements where they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to get likes.</v>

1376
01:03:11.010 --> 01:03:12.510
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well there's a lot of that for sure.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That podcast you did with Jamie was </v>

1411
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:46.100
<v Speaker 5>really good and I say this as someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>who liked Jamie originally and then when</v>

1412
01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:49.140
<v Speaker 5>he did the podcast with you and red </v>
<v Speaker 5>band,</v>

1413
01:04:49.830 --> 01:04:52.570
<v Speaker 5>I guessed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like where you call it,</v>

1414
01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:53.410
<v Speaker 5>you guys rapists.</v>

1417
01:04:54.111 --> 01:04:58.210
<v Speaker 5>He didn't call us rapist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't definitely charge you with rape.</v>

1418
01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:03.540
<v Speaker 5>He called it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He joked around about red band being a </v>

1419
01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:05.450
<v Speaker 5>rapist afterwards because red band </v>
<v Speaker 5>criticized him after being on the show.</v>

1420
01:05:05.451 --> 01:05:09.290
<v Speaker 5>It was like it was really stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I never disliked him after that,</v>

1421
01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:10.280
<v Speaker 5>but I was like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1422
01:05:10.281 --> 01:05:15.281
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was fucked up because he did </v>

1423
01:05:15.281 --> 01:05:15.281
<v Speaker 5>represent that story incorrectly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1424

<v Speaker 5>this is what you're talking about is </v>
<v Speaker 5>video called the kills team</v>

1425

<v Speaker 3>Brendon Brandon,</v>

1426
01:05:21.310 --> 01:05:26.310
<v Speaker 3>took one part of what we said together </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then kills Dean's version of it.</v>

1427
01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:30.550
<v Speaker 3>Spliced them together so you could see </v>
<v Speaker 3>what we actually said when he read,</v>

1428
01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:34.300
<v Speaker 3>when he recorded it on his show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To all the super lefties,</v>

1429
01:05:34.450 --> 01:05:36.580
<v Speaker 3>but he was super honest about it when he</v>
<v Speaker 3>came on the podcast.</v>

1430
01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:40.130
<v Speaker 3>New podcast man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm glad we're.</v>

1431
01:05:40.350 --> 01:05:41.620
<v Speaker 3>He's still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does stand up right,</v>

1432
01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:43.970
<v Speaker 3>because he still wants to do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't stopped.</v>

1433
01:05:44.070 --> 01:05:45.940
<v Speaker 3>He wants to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He stopped,</v>

1434
01:05:45.970 --> 01:05:47.020
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They went after him.</v>

1435
01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:49.450
<v Speaker 3>They attacked him like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and here's the thing.</v>

1436
01:05:49.570 --> 01:05:52.720
<v Speaker 3>Whether or not he was guilty of basic </v>
<v Speaker 3>normal,</v>

1437
01:05:52.721 --> 01:05:56.560
<v Speaker 3>slimy male type behavior that we do on </v>
<v Speaker 3>occasionally,</v>

1438
01:05:56.561 --> 01:05:58.480
<v Speaker 3>especially when intoxicated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to get late.</v>

1439
01:05:58.630 --> 01:06:01.810
<v Speaker 3>Whether he was guilty of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way I'm wrong.</v>

1440
01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:04.090
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you are guilty of that.</v>

1441
01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:05.620
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 4>sometimes when you're married so long </v>

1493
01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:44.140
<v Speaker 4>you fantasize about just going back to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the girl with smelly feet and smoking a </v>

1494
01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:47.081
<v Speaker 4>bowl with those little bum pack and </v>
<v Speaker 4>bowls and bowls.</v>

1495
01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:52.660
<v Speaker 4>So that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you got me saying earlier with </v>

1496
01:08:55.670 --> 01:09:00.670

01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:02.600
<v Speaker 4>she says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Tell anyone about this.</v>

1499
01:09:06.771 --> 01:09:08.420

<v Speaker 4>podcast.</v>

1500
01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:09.830
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't say her name yet.</v>

1501
01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:11.030
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you definitely can't tell the rich boss.</v>

1503
01:09:13.970 --> 01:09:15.620

<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1504
01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:17.030
<v Speaker 4>She goes,</v>

<v Speaker 4>don't tell rich balls.</v>

1506
01:09:18.891 --> 01:09:20.100
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's an odd.</v>

1507
01:09:21.610 --> 01:09:26.610
<v Speaker 4>So I used to work the door at the club,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I walked to the club at like seven </v>

1508
01:09:26.610 --> 01:09:27.600
<v Speaker 4>because that's when I had to sit out and</v>
<v Speaker 4>bosses back when he smoked,</v>

1509
01:09:27.601 --> 01:09:29.750
<v Speaker 4>it was sitting out smoking a cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>me too.</v>

1513
01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:38.270
<v Speaker 4>I had to give a ride to Brooklyn.</v>

1514
01:09:38.271 --> 01:09:40.760

<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gets up on your stinky.</v>

1516
01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:44.810
<v Speaker 4>Wait.</v>

1517
01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:49.950
<v Speaker 4>Don't sometimes get into,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1518
01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:51.950
<v Speaker 4>that's a thing that there's connections </v>
<v Speaker 4>that happen,</v>

1519
01:09:51.951 --> 01:09:54.350
<v Speaker 4>especially when you're young.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Chris Ryan did talk about.</v>

1520
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:57.740
<v Speaker 4>But when you have sex with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're real young,</v>

1521
01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:01.190
<v Speaker 4>if something happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's a trigger that goes off and</v>

1522
01:10:01.191 --> 01:10:03.250
<v Speaker 4>that thing can become like a fetish for </v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

1523
01:10:03.251 --> 01:10:06.980
<v Speaker 4>It's like weird stockings or stinky </v>
<v Speaker 4>waitress feet or rubber gloves.</v>

1524
01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:07.970
<v Speaker 4>Rubber.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The rubber,</v>

1525
01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:10.400
<v Speaker 4>the rubber gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rubber gloves thing.</v>

1526
01:10:10.530 --> 01:10:12.350
<v Speaker 4>You get jerked off by a maid?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>

1527
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:15.260
<v Speaker 4>I don't know where they came from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yellow rubber gloves.</v>

1528
01:10:15.290 --> 01:10:19.520
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever go to get where it came </v>
<v Speaker 4>from like you came from,</v>

1529
01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:21.260
<v Speaker 4>but that's what you're talking about a </v>
<v Speaker 4>different thing.</v>

1530
01:10:21.261 --> 01:10:23.120
<v Speaker 4>Then the idea is you get where it came </v>
<v Speaker 4>from.</v>

1531
01:10:23.121 --> 01:10:25.970
<v Speaker 4>It's like like a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you used to bang this chick.</v>

1532
01:10:25.971 --> 01:10:28.370
<v Speaker 4>She worked together with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys were both tired.</v>

1533
01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:30.020
<v Speaker 4>He got off work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're all sweaty.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Who gives a shit both beers in.</v>

1538
01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:44.360

<v Speaker 4>anything like you know,</v>

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:49.540
<v Speaker 4>out of the norm is happening that enough</v>
<v Speaker 4>times that's going to be tied in those </v>

1540
01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:50.040
<v Speaker 4>settings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's not only that.</v>

1566
01:12:06.570 --> 01:12:09.570
<v Speaker 3>She won by almost a marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thirteen percent.</v>

1567
01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:15.020
<v Speaker 3>She won by almost two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was more than 22 miles to </v>

1568
01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:15.020

1569
01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:16.550
<v Speaker 3>So like when she crossed she could have </v>
<v Speaker 3>taken,</v>

1570
01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:21.590
<v Speaker 3>this is what I was going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a marathon after she finished to catch </v>

<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

1573
01:12:24.651 --> 01:12:24.651
<v Speaker 3>you could have taken an eight hour </v>
<v Speaker 3>sleep,</v>

1574
01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:29.780
<v Speaker 3>a real good solid sleep room service.</v>

<v Speaker 3>watch that poor fuck the second place,</v>

<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Although there was two huge winds by </v>
<v Speaker 3>women in a row,</v>

<v Speaker 3>endurance races ever.</v>

1582
01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:54.560
<v Speaker 3>And then a woman won the New York City </v>
<v Speaker 3>marathon on Saturday or on Sunday for </v>

1662
01:16:34.211 --> 01:16:36.940
<v Speaker 3>Like how many people were around them at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same time?</v>

1663
01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:38.880
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if she's still came in seventh,</v>

1664
01:16:38.881 --> 01:16:39.460
<v Speaker 3>then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1665
01:16:39.490 --> 01:16:42.640
<v Speaker 3>those seven people hadn't signed that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She would have won that as possible,</v>

1666
01:16:42.850 --> 01:16:44.740
<v Speaker 3>but this is the thing about debt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>courtney check.</v>

1667
01:16:44.741 --> 01:16:49.741
<v Speaker 3>It makes you wonder like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if there's like a number where you </v>

1668
01:16:49.741 --> 01:16:52.411
<v Speaker 3>pass where it's just in your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you can get to a place where it's </v>

1669
01:16:52.411 --> 01:16:56.491
<v Speaker 3>your body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you can get to a place where you </v>

1670
01:16:56.491 --> 01:16:56.491
<v Speaker 3>train hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fairly easy,</v>

1671
01:16:56.491 --> 01:17:00.690
<v Speaker 3>but there's a number that you passed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's 100 miles or 200 miles or </v>

1672
01:17:00.690 --> 01:17:02.650
<v Speaker 3>whatever that number is where it's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>your mind.</v>

1673
01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:07.860
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter how strong you are </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you can force your body to do </v>

1674
01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:08.620
<v Speaker 3>things that it doesn't want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether they can do.</v>

<v Speaker 5>though?</v>

1759
01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:12.510
<v Speaker 5>But what's a full.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's.</v>

1760
01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:17.540
<v Speaker 5>What's a good time for five hours was </v>
<v Speaker 5>the one we all talked about that </v>

1761
01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:21.280
<v Speaker 5>originally was really hard to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1762
01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:21.980
<v Speaker 5>You're totally right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1763
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:23.760
<v Speaker 5>How many men beat five hours in the last</v>
<v Speaker 5>marathon?</v>

1764
01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:27.570
<v Speaker 5>What's the abject marathon in?</v>
<v Speaker 5>New York's different because you have to</v>

1765
01:21:27.571 --> 01:21:32.571
<v Speaker 5>qualify for it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that's something like the average </v>

1766
01:21:33.010 --> 01:21:36.180
<v Speaker 5>people beat five hours knowing that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>have to qualify.</v>

1767
01:21:36.181 --> 01:21:38.040
<v Speaker 5>Let's take a look at a lot or marine </v>
<v Speaker 5>corps.</v>

01:21:38.041 --> 01:21:40.110
<v Speaker 5>What's your goal?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's your goal?</v>

1769
01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:45.250
<v Speaker 5>My goal in my head is always been doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>the half.</v>

1770
01:21:45.630 --> 01:21:50.630
<v Speaker 5>What's your goal in the half?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Two hours and 30 minutes for five hours </v>

1771
01:21:50.630 --> 01:21:52.050
<v Speaker 5>for a full weight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not really a slow down.</v>

1772
01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:54.690
<v Speaker 5>Slow down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a runner.</v>

1773
01:21:54.691 --> 01:21:58.110
<v Speaker 5>To average finish at the New York </v>
<v Speaker 5>marathon was four hours.</v>

1774
01:21:58.110 --> 01:21:59.720
<v Speaker 5>Thirty four minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Five.</v>

1775
01:21:59.870 --> 01:22:04.050
<v Speaker 5>Six,</v>
<v Speaker 5>seven minute miles.</v>

1776
01:22:04.051 --> 01:22:05.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This guy's finished it two hours.</v>

1777
01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:10.110
<v Speaker 5>Franklin Franklin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a bit way back in the 19 eighties,</v>

1778
01:22:10.111 --> 01:22:13.170
<v Speaker 5>was hilarious about the Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

1779
01:22:13.230 --> 01:22:13.590
<v Speaker 5>hey.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

1780
01:22:13.591 --> 01:22:15.210
<v Speaker 5>I don't look at the guy who wins.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

1781
01:22:15.211 --> 01:22:17.340
<v Speaker 5>I look at the guy who loses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

1782
01:22:17.490 --> 01:22:18.930
<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you look at his face when he's coming.</v>

1783
01:22:18.931 --> 01:22:19.980
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God damn,</v>

1784
01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:22.320
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to come in last and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Olympics,</v>

1785
01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:25.440
<v Speaker 5>and he starts thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1786
01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:27.440
<v Speaker 5>if I didn't even fucking train,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's still coming.</v>

1787
01:22:27.450 --> 01:22:29.570
<v Speaker 5>Last things all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>train.</v>

1788
01:22:29.670 --> 01:22:31.470
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>never reality started setting in and you</v>

1789
01:22:31.471 --> 01:22:34.140
<v Speaker 5>see how he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even have a fucking job.</v>

1790
01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:38.630
<v Speaker 5>So true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a great bit,</v>

1791
01:22:38.631 --> 01:22:40.350
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fucking great bit.</v>

1792
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:44.100
<v Speaker 5>And start that off with going like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because he in his country,</v>

1793
01:22:44.101 --> 01:22:46.980
<v Speaker 5>this is the fastest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he started going down,</v>

1794
01:22:47.730 --> 01:22:49.280
<v Speaker 5>going to win the Olympic gold and he'd </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1795
01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:52.500
<v Speaker 5>you run your first few paces down and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then you come up and then it was like,</v>

1796
01:22:52.501 --> 01:22:56.640
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is your firm?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Try to crack two hours.</v>

1797
01:22:57.060 --> 01:22:59.010

<v Speaker 5>Jamie,</v>

1798
01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:01.530
<v Speaker 5>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Six minutes.</v>

1799
01:23:04.650 --> 01:23:06.070
<v Speaker 5>Six miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a 10 minute</v>

1800
01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:09.130
<v Speaker 3>mile miles really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's your normal mouse?</v>

1801
01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:10.510
<v Speaker 3>If you would just want to find five </v>
<v Speaker 3>miles.</v>

1802
01:23:10.570 --> 01:23:12.460
<v Speaker 3>If I was going to go out and run five </v>
<v Speaker 3>miles treadmill,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Salts.</v>

1805
01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:17.680
<v Speaker 3>They're sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're sick.</v>

1806
01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:22.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to thank the guy I wish I could </v>

1807
01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:22.740

<v Speaker 3>And he stumped.</v>

1808
01:23:22.740 --> 01:23:25.790
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the name of the </v>

1809
01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:25.790
<v Speaker 3>company is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the name of the company?</v>

1810
01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:25.790
<v Speaker 3>Aerosault.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was so cool.</v>

1811
01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:26.680
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1812
01:23:27.310 --> 01:23:29.290
<v Speaker 3>I heard you talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to just hook you up.</v>

1813
01:23:29.291 --> 01:23:30.850
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't need anything.</v>

1814
01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:33.010
<v Speaker 3>They don't need anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just enjoy it.</v>

1815
01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:34.590
<v Speaker 3>And it was so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Difference.</v>

1816
01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:39.620
<v Speaker 3>There's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's treadmills that come towards </v>

1817
01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:39.620
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Treadmills that are basically like a sea</v>

1818
01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:42.120
<v Speaker 3>let us run on one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called Ron at one that says,</v>

1819
01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:45.700
<v Speaker 3>has wood in the name because it's all </v>
<v Speaker 3>wood part aerosol.</v>

1820
01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:48.170
<v Speaker 3>One that they gave her some serious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1821
01:23:48.171 --> 01:23:53.171
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's way better for you than running on </v>

1822
01:23:53.171 --> 01:23:53.171
<v Speaker 3>a treadmill because like Bert was </v>
<v Speaker 3>telling,</v>

1823
01:23:53.171 --> 01:23:54.250
<v Speaker 3>talking about is running times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I was thinking,</v>

1824
01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:56.840
<v Speaker 3>you have things coming towards you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>

1825
01:23:57.050 --> 01:23:58.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it does matter.</v>

1826
01:23:58.690 --> 01:24:00.450
<v Speaker 3>So you got one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Burt A.</v>

1827
01:24:00.530 --> 01:24:01.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1828
01:24:01.290 --> 01:24:03.240
<v Speaker 3>This is the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this runner,</v>

1829
01:24:03.250 --> 01:24:04.570
<v Speaker 3>it's called the air runner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1830
01:24:04.571 --> 01:24:05.490
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The air runner,</v>

1831
01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:07.930
<v Speaker 3>not aerosol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there is an air assault bike.</v>

1832
01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:09.580
<v Speaker 3>That's what you're thinking of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a rogue.</v>

1833
01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:13.110
<v Speaker 3>This is a good way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes a treadmill when I was thinking</v>

1834
01:24:13.130 --> 01:24:15.430
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because this thing is that like a slight</v>

1835
01:24:15.490 --> 01:24:20.490
<v Speaker 3>angle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're also running on the toes of your </v>

1836
01:24:20.490 --> 01:24:21.970
<v Speaker 3>feet and the ball of your feet to </v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of flat on the ground.</v>

1837
01:24:21.971 --> 01:24:23.950
<v Speaker 3>So how many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many minutes to go on that?</v>

1838
01:24:24.190 --> 01:24:24.790
<v Speaker 3>Miles an hour.</v>

1839
01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:30.440
<v Speaker 3>I only,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now I'm just getting that set up </v>

1840
01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:30.440
<v Speaker 3>in the man cave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't gotten on it.</v>

1841
01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:33.840
<v Speaker 3>It's A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could do 10 minute miles very easily </v>

1842
01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:36.150
<v Speaker 3>for on a treadmill on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>

1843
01:24:36.230 --> 01:24:38.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm at like 11 minute miles times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many?</v>

1844
01:24:39.190 --> 01:24:42.040
<v Speaker 3>Thirteen miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thirteen miles.</v>

1845
01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:44.320
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's beneath two hours.</v>

1846
01:24:44.690 --> 01:24:49.150
<v Speaker 3>It was just carrying extra weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're carrying extra weight if you just</v>

1847
01:24:49.151 --> 01:24:54.151
<v Speaker 3>committed to some so you could actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>live the lifestyle you live in because </v>

1848
01:24:54.151 --> 01:24:54.151
<v Speaker 3>you're not gaining any weight can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>shredded.</v>

1849
01:24:54.151 --> 01:24:54.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He might know.</v>

1850
01:24:56.020 --> 01:24:59.110
<v Speaker 3>You have to think about this when it </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes to like body,</v>

1851
01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:00.910
<v Speaker 3>like what you're carrying around with </v>
<v Speaker 3>your body,</v>

1852
01:25:01.090 --> 01:25:03.940
<v Speaker 3>like you're not gaining a lot of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're pretty consistent,</v>

1853
01:25:03.941 --> 01:25:06.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you taste the weight,</v>

1854
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:08.020
<v Speaker 3>like Tommy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've been very consistent,</v>

1855
01:25:08.650 --> 01:25:13.650
<v Speaker 3>very consistent with his shirt off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a beautiful man.</v>

1856
01:25:14.540 --> 01:25:15.310
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's true.</v>

1857
01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:15.940
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

1858
01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:17.290
<v Speaker 3>It's not true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what happened?</v>

1859
01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:21.540
<v Speaker 3>What did you think you gained weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>size of private.</v>

1860
01:25:21.570 --> 01:25:23.660
<v Speaker 3>He said you won't get wet and you won't </v>
<v Speaker 3>step on a scale in front of him.</v>

1861
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:28.300
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you never asked me after the podcast.</v>

1862
01:25:28.301 --> 01:25:29.200
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's all go away.</v>

1863
01:25:29.201 --> 01:25:34.201
<v Speaker 3>And you said I don't have time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kissed her and then I got and were </v>

1864
01:25:34.201 --> 01:25:35.980
<v Speaker 3>point four pounds lighter than me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1865
01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:37.300
<v Speaker 3>But I haven't gained weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1866
01:25:37.330 --> 01:25:37.600
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1867
01:25:37.601 --> 01:25:42.601
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the way Joe says it is you've been </v>

1868
01:25:42.601 --> 01:25:44.641
<v Speaker 3>very good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't to do that to fuck with you </v>

1887
01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:24.560
<v Speaker 5>he's on the road to understand this by </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself and you will only point four </v>

1888
01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:26.930
<v Speaker 5>pounds below him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1889
01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:32.000
<v Speaker 5>And you are over an inch shorter than </v>
<v Speaker 5>him is so much fatter than you get it.</v>

1890
01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:36.600
<v Speaker 5>It's uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should be with the extra inch.</v>

1891
01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:38.550
<v Speaker 5>Same Height.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should be thinner,</v>

1892
01:26:38.551 --> 01:26:41.670
<v Speaker 5>but you're this round.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't initially want to go.</v>

1893
01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:46.300
<v Speaker 5>Tom and I are going to leave you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You guys figure this out.</v>

1895
01:26:54.780 --> 01:26:56.580
<v Speaker 5>I want to see both your bellies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't make sense.</v>

1896
01:26:56.670 --> 01:26:58.070
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can we be honest?</v>

1897
01:26:58.270 --> 01:26:59.500
<v Speaker 6>We're going to talk about this when we </v>
<v Speaker 6>get back.</v>

1898
01:26:59.501 --> 01:27:02.350
<v Speaker 6>So p and think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fat Shaming.</v>

1899
01:27:02.610 --> 01:27:04.120
<v Speaker 6>Want to talk about fat shaming when you </v>
<v Speaker 6>come back?</v>

1900
01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:05.440
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when we were kids,</v>

1901
01:27:05.441 --> 01:27:07.600
<v Speaker 6>there was no such thing and I think the </v>
<v Speaker 6>world was dispatched.</v>

1902
01:27:07.950 --> 01:27:09.760
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the world was a better place.</v>

1903
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:15.000
<v Speaker 6>There just happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think you should be happy being </v>

1904
01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.821
<v Speaker 6>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think anybody should be mean to </v>

1905
01:27:17.821 --> 01:27:17.821
<v Speaker 6>you because you're fat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think there's a.</v>

1906
01:27:17.821 --> 01:27:18.700
<v Speaker 6>You could do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You'd feel better if you weren't.</v>

1907
01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:20.950
<v Speaker 6>That's it if you weren't fat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1908
01:27:21.190 --> 01:27:21.970
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe it should be.</v>

1909
01:27:21.971 --> 01:27:26.020
<v Speaker 6>Something else was like shaming fat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>shaming,</v>

1910
01:27:26.110 --> 01:27:31.110
<v Speaker 6>shaming,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so it's like I've seen him talk about </v>

1911
01:27:31.110 --> 01:27:31.410
<v Speaker 6>fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

1912
01:27:31.450 --> 01:27:36.450
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one fighter tried to bully the other </v>

1913
01:27:36.450 --> 01:27:36.450
<v Speaker 6>fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

1914
01:27:36.450 --> 01:27:38.551
<v Speaker 6>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're about to kick the shit out of </v>

1915
01:27:38.551 --> 01:27:38.551
<v Speaker 6>each.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Try to impose his game.</v>

1916
01:27:38.551 --> 01:27:39.460
<v Speaker 6>This is psychological warfare.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Can you call him a bully?</v>

1917
01:27:39.510 --> 01:27:41.440
<v Speaker 6>You can't really call him bully because </v>
<v Speaker 6>he's a champ.</v>

1918
01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:43.720
<v Speaker 6>That's how you say the champ.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Keep everybody scared.</v>

1919
01:27:43.721 --> 01:27:48.721
<v Speaker 6>Remember Mike Tyson,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the eighties to the greatest time to be </v>

1920
01:27:48.721 --> 01:27:49.360
<v Speaker 6>alive for a box.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was bullied when he got 100 percent.</v>

1921
01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:51.910
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That words bullshit.</v>

1922
01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:55.420
<v Speaker 6>The word should apply to someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 6>picking on someone who's meek,</v>

1923
01:27:55.810 --> 01:27:58.600
<v Speaker 6>but to push out a more little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1924
01:27:58.630 --> 01:27:59.620
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

1925
01:27:59.770 --> 01:28:03.130
<v Speaker 6>There's something about that that's like</v>
<v Speaker 6>horrible,</v>

1926
01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:05.830
<v Speaker 6>but you can't apply that to things that </v>
<v Speaker 6>aren't real bullies.</v>

1927
01:28:05.831 --> 01:28:07.990
<v Speaker 6>Especially like fighters talking shit to</v>
<v Speaker 6>each other.</v>

1928
01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:11.990
<v Speaker 6>They're not being bullies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're engaging in your.</v>

1929
01:28:12.130 --> 01:28:14.230
<v Speaker 6>You're trying to get a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 6>upper hand.</v>

1930
01:28:14.231 --> 01:28:19.231
<v Speaker 6>We all know that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's real to pretend to psychological </v>

1931
01:28:19.231 --> 01:28:19.231
<v Speaker 6>upper hands,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like forget about fighting.</v>

1932
01:28:19.231 --> 01:28:23.670
<v Speaker 6>What about girls?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You remember when there was a girl that </v>

1933
01:28:23.670 --> 01:28:24.910
<v Speaker 6>you did not think you could talk to and </v>
<v Speaker 6>if she talked to you,</v>

1934
01:28:24.911 --> 01:28:28.210
<v Speaker 6>you'd fucking lock up and panic in </v>
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>

1935
01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:33.420
<v Speaker 6>That's like there's a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 6>position when you feel like you're not </v>

1936
01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:35.860
<v Speaker 6>in the position to be able to like kiss </v>
<v Speaker 6>that girl or have sex with that girl.</v>

1937
01:28:35.861 --> 01:28:36.760
<v Speaker 6>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's no way.</v>

1938
01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:41.180
<v Speaker 6>Especially when you're a teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're like baffled because yeah,</v>

1939
01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:44.530
<v Speaker 6>you don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't know which one's going to like</v>

1940
01:28:44.531 --> 01:28:45.610
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Which one's not like,</v>

1941
01:28:45.730 --> 01:28:50.730
<v Speaker 6>why do people like you?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why do they not like you remember the </v>

1942
01:28:50.730 --> 01:28:53.881
<v Speaker 6>feeling?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I remember that girl that had boobs was </v>

1943
01:28:53.881 --> 01:28:55.330
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one day I'll have boobs,</v>

<v Speaker 6>ips,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like one day you do have boobs,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1949
01:29:06.481 --> 01:29:11.481
<v Speaker 3>but you're back to play a prank or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something back that is new for black </v>

1950
01:29:13.231 --> 01:29:15.990
<v Speaker 3>girls in high school where you couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe that they liked you.</v>

1951
01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:18.660
<v Speaker 3>Like meeting people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you were young,</v>

1952
01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:20.700
<v Speaker 3>like when you would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

1953
01:29:20.710 --> 01:29:22.050
<v Speaker 3>a girl would like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are not like,</v>

1954
01:29:22.051 --> 01:29:25.030
<v Speaker 3>you either have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like you like a,</v>

1955
01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:28.770
<v Speaker 3>like you opened up a page in Spanish and</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone told you what the word is.</v>

1956
01:29:28.771 --> 01:29:29.160
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1957
01:29:29.161 --> 01:29:30.300
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it means.</v>

1958
01:29:30.301 --> 01:29:30.870
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

1959
01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:32.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a little unit before.</v>

1960
01:29:32.130 --> 01:29:34.740
<v Speaker 3>I really have no idea why I would like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are not like you,</v>

1961
01:29:35.130 --> 01:29:37.380
<v Speaker 3>like when when you're a teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're in high school,</v>

1962
01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:42.420
<v Speaker 3>you know when it goes sideways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Midwest.</v>

1963
01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:43.370
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1964
01:29:43.371 --> 01:29:45.180
<v Speaker 3>I'll never get that again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never again.</v>

1965
01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:45.900
<v Speaker 3>And it's over.</v>

1966
01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:50.960
<v Speaker 3>And then you smell like desperation or </v>
<v Speaker 3>do you remember when like someone </v>

1967
01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:53.210
<v Speaker 3>because you're genuinely not interested.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1968
01:29:53.230 --> 01:29:57.990
<v Speaker 3>Then when you discover that your lack of</v>
<v Speaker 3>interest gets interest and you're like,</v>

1969
01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:01.890
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're not saying that that's it.</v>

01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:02.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1973
01:30:04.681 --> 01:30:05.230
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1974
01:30:05.250 --> 01:30:06.410

<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1975
01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:09.470
<v Speaker 3>I like even more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how you operate.</v>

1976
01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:12.940
<v Speaker 3>Date me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very,</v>

1977

<v Speaker 3>Psychology.</v>

1978
01:30:14.790 --> 01:30:16.110
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't like it.</v>

1979
01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:21.180
<v Speaker 3>But girl turned around doggystyle </v>
<v Speaker 3>spreading her butt cheeks apart.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That holds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's a loser loser because he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to fuck anymore.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Warning signs.</v>

1996
01:30:56.190 --> 01:30:59.220
<v Speaker 3>Then feeling of pain that we have when </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone leaves us.</v>

2022
01:32:10.081 --> 01:32:10.081
<v Speaker 3>the next challenge.</v>

2023
01:32:10.081 --> 01:32:14.890
<v Speaker 3>Can we dip our toes in with vegetarian?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe if you're going to go vegetarian,</v>

2024
01:32:16.931 --> 01:32:21.931
<v Speaker 3>you can have eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't have milk or cheese </v>

2025
01:32:21.931 --> 01:32:22.850
<v Speaker 3>because I'll give you the eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about that?</v>

2034
01:32:45.790 --> 01:32:50.790

<v Speaker 3>All my chickens are fucking bolting and </v>

01:32:51.251 --> 01:32:53.500
<v Speaker 3>they're not laying eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really got bitch ass.</v>

2036
01:32:53.501 --> 01:32:58.501
<v Speaker 3>Chickens definitely have chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might have pitched chickens to feed </v>

2037
01:32:58.501 --> 01:32:59.460
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good food too.</v>

2038
01:33:02.610 --> 01:33:03.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do too,</v>

2039
01:33:03.610 --> 01:33:04.510

<v Speaker 3>I have once a month.</v>

2041
01:33:06.670 --> 01:33:08.500
<v Speaker 3>20 chickens to get eggs once a month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2042
01:33:08.530 --> 01:33:10.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get eggs today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a good dude.</v>

2043
01:33:10.830 --> 01:33:11.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

2044
01:33:11.161 --> 01:33:14.110
<v Speaker 3>But you know what's good about written </v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you have your own chickens,</v>

2045
01:33:14.111 --> 01:33:19.111
<v Speaker 3>their Karma free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those say those chickens don't give a </v>

2046
01:33:19.111 --> 01:33:19.111
<v Speaker 3>fuck about those eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those eggs will never be a chicken.</v>

2047
01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:21.700
<v Speaker 3>And you have a good relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the chickens.</v>

2048
01:33:21.701 --> 01:33:24.170
<v Speaker 3>I feed them food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They give me eggs.</v>

2049
01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:26.200
<v Speaker 3>It's simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's not,</v>

2050
01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:31.440
<v Speaker 3>it's not like an imbalance because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>would it cost to feed the chickens is </v>

2051
01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:32.560
<v Speaker 3>basically what it cost to buy eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I told her a story.</v>

2057
01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:47.010
<v Speaker 3>So in the interest of brevity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell it.</v>

2058
01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:47.860
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell it quickly.</v>

<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2064
01:33:59.110 --> 01:34:04.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we put in a glass fence in the back of </v>

2065
01:34:04.110 --> 01:34:06.490
<v Speaker 3>my yard and hawks keeps slamming into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the glass fence.</v>

2066
01:34:06.770 --> 01:34:10.270
<v Speaker 3>We've killed at least three and Koh </v>
<v Speaker 3>several more.</v>

2067
01:34:10.590 --> 01:34:13.390
<v Speaker 3>Or were these hawks or Kale blood coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the nose.</v>

2068
01:34:14.010 --> 01:34:14.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2069
01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:17.380
<v Speaker 3>I've seen him a camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's probably a good idea.</v>

2070
01:34:17.381 --> 01:34:20.470
<v Speaker 3>But it only happens like once a month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyway.</v>

2071
01:34:20.471 --> 01:34:23.440
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one hawk got code came back,</v>

2072
01:34:23.441 --> 01:34:25.180
<v Speaker 3>but at a fucked up wing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2073
01:34:25.181 --> 01:34:30.181
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we take the Hawk and we preserve it and </v>

2074
01:34:30.181 --> 01:34:33.541
<v Speaker 3>we put the hawk in like this container </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we get some food for it from the pet</v>

2075
01:34:33.881 --> 01:34:34.710
<v Speaker 3>store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The pet store,</v>

2076
01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:37.210
<v Speaker 3>these things called pinkies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would have pinky is,</v>

2077
01:34:37.390 --> 01:34:40.000
<v Speaker 3>is a little tiny baby mouse that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>already.</v>

2078
01:34:40.250 --> 01:34:43.630
<v Speaker 3>It's weaning off its mother's blind and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they feed them is snakes.</v>

2079
01:34:43.631 --> 01:34:44.920
<v Speaker 3>It's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Horrible Shit.</v>

2080
01:34:45.310 --> 01:34:50.310
<v Speaker 3>So we get pinkies for this hok as Hok </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucks up these pinkies all except one </v>

2081
01:34:50.310 --> 01:34:54.391
<v Speaker 3>pinky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We get the hock to the wildlife place </v>

2082
01:34:54.391 --> 01:34:55.300
<v Speaker 3>where they repair wildlife on Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2083
01:34:55.301 --> 01:34:56.190
<v Speaker 3>it's like one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2084
01:34:56.530 --> 01:34:59.270
<v Speaker 3>places where they deal with injured and </v>
<v Speaker 3>drive a hawk there.</v>

2085
01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:04.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we took the hockey puck and they're </v>

2086
01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:04.300
<v Speaker 3>worried about getting out to slow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The hawks are,</v>

2087
01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:04.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

2088
01:35:04.300 --> 01:35:08.360
<v Speaker 3>they're very valuable thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>back to the ecosystem and put it in the </v>

2089
01:35:09.651 --> 01:35:11.750
<v Speaker 3>trunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they're important.</v>

2090
01:35:11.751 --> 01:35:16.751
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you put them in front of you is how </v>

2091
01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:23.080
<v Speaker 3>evolution works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to do your part whenever </v>

2092
01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:23.080
<v Speaker 3>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these hawks got to figure out.</v>

2093
01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:24.800
<v Speaker 3>That's a fucking fancy dumb cunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could see the fence.</v>

2094
01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:28.160
<v Speaker 3>How can we don't see the fence?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess you don't deserve to evolve.</v>

2095
01:35:28.190 --> 01:35:33.190
<v Speaker 3>That's so fucking core.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're left with one pinky on full </v>

2096
01:35:33.190 --> 01:35:36.610
<v Speaker 3>full 60 miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a feather.</v>

2097
01:35:37.010 --> 01:35:39.050
<v Speaker 3>Here's what's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen it happen a couple of times.</v>

2098
01:35:39.051 --> 01:35:44.051
<v Speaker 3>She paint mice on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the glass box.</v>

2099
01:35:49.870 --> 01:35:54.870
<v Speaker 3>Come in full.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a photo with a rabbit with a </v>

2100
01:35:56.090 --> 01:36:00.630
<v Speaker 3>steel spike who write with a rabbit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like flying right into your rabbit.</v>

2101
01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:05.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when it was done was one pinky </v>

2102
01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:10.900
<v Speaker 3>leftovers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Hawk did neat and my daughters </v>

2103
01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:10.900
<v Speaker 3>wanted to keep the pinky as a pen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2104
01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:11.060
<v Speaker 3>it's going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can't eat.</v>

2105
01:36:11.090 --> 01:36:16.090
<v Speaker 3>It's going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's supposed to be weaning off its </v>

2106
01:36:16.090 --> 01:36:17.741
<v Speaker 3>mother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It probably shouldn't even be alive </v>

2107
01:36:17.741 --> 01:36:17.741
<v Speaker 3>still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a day later I go,</v>

2108
01:36:17.741 --> 01:36:18.500
<v Speaker 3>let's just feed it to the chicken and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody freaked the fuck out.</v>

2109
01:36:18.530 --> 01:36:20.480
<v Speaker 3>Like you're a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're an asshole.</v>

2110
01:36:20.570 --> 01:36:21.110
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2111
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.540
<v Speaker 3>listen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2112
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:23.990
<v Speaker 3>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one called him an asshole.</v>

2113
01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:26.090
<v Speaker 3>They're nine and seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

2114
01:36:30.810 --> 01:36:35.810
<v Speaker 3>I say this like you can take his pinky </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I could bring it back to the pet </v>

2115
01:36:36.741 --> 01:36:41.741
<v Speaker 3>store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're just going to feed it to a </v>

2116
01:36:41.741 --> 01:36:41.741
<v Speaker 3>snake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2117
01:36:41.741 --> 01:36:41.741
<v Speaker 3>that's what they have in there for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to feed them to.</v>

2118
01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:44.510
<v Speaker 3>The mother won't accept it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has our smell on it.</v>

2119
01:36:44.630 --> 01:36:45.650
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to die.</v>

2120
01:36:45.770 --> 01:36:47.060
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just feed it to the chickens.</v>

2121
01:36:47.061 --> 01:36:52.061
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is it okay to feed it to the hawks </v>

2122
01:36:52.061 --> 01:36:52.061
<v Speaker 3>but it's not okay to feed to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>chickens.</v>

2123
01:36:52.061 --> 01:36:56.410
<v Speaker 3>So they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think the chickens are going to </v>

2124
01:36:56.410 --> 01:36:56.410
<v Speaker 3>eat it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

2125
01:36:56.410 --> 01:36:58.361
<v Speaker 3>I fucking know they have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to eat it because I have </v>

2126
01:36:58.361 --> 01:36:59.930
<v Speaker 3>youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've watched on till you see it happen.</v>

2127
01:36:59.931 --> 01:37:04.931
<v Speaker 3>I saw them chase it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a mouse once that got in there and fuck </v>

2128
01:37:04.931 --> 01:37:04.931
<v Speaker 3>it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I knew they were going to do it and I</v>

2129
01:37:04.931 --> 01:37:05.510
<v Speaker 3>put that mouse on the ground.</v>

2130
01:37:05.540 --> 01:37:08.210
<v Speaker 3>Do they dart on that thing in less than </v>
<v Speaker 3>one second?</v>

2131
01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:13.300
<v Speaker 3>One chicken had it and it was running </v>
<v Speaker 3>around and all the other chickens were </v>

2132
01:37:13.300 --> 01:37:14.140
<v Speaker 3>chasing her and they were running around</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to kill it.</v>

2133
01:37:14.150 --> 01:37:17.030
<v Speaker 3>They tore it apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now if I put a plate of corn down,</v>

2134
01:37:17.170 --> 01:37:19.160
<v Speaker 3>they barely flinched.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go.</v>

2135
01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:20.360
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Time to eat.</v>

2136
01:37:20.530 --> 01:37:20.980
<v Speaker 3>Peck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Peck,</v>

2137
01:37:20.981 --> 01:37:21.470
<v Speaker 3>Peck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Peck.</v>

2138
01:37:21.471 --> 01:37:23.120
<v Speaker 3>The district.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How often do you give them?</v>

2139
01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:24.260
<v Speaker 3>Mice?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very rarely.</v>

2140
01:37:24.261 --> 01:37:26.950
<v Speaker 3>It's only happened one time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2141
01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:28.970
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shut up.</v>

2142
01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:33.530
<v Speaker 3>That's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That never happens with any other food.</v>

2143
01:37:33.580 --> 01:37:36.870
<v Speaker 3>I know there's plenty of stuff in there </v>
<v Speaker 3>for all of us know,</v>

2144
01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:40.300
<v Speaker 3>but that one chicken has that mouse and </v>
<v Speaker 3>she'll have to fight for it.</v>

2145
01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:42.680
<v Speaker 3>All the other ones who gang up on her </v>
<v Speaker 3>cornered?</v>

2146
01:37:43.010 --> 01:37:44.330
<v Speaker 3>Cornered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

<v Speaker 3>quick as you can,</v>

2148
01:37:46.491 --> 01:37:48.350
<v Speaker 3>but like rewards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>selfishness.</v>

2149
01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:53.720
<v Speaker 3>This chicken is running away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting some pains in my yard.</v>

2150

2151
01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:59.190
<v Speaker 5>pink mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you could do that with full on mice,</v>

2152
01:37:59.191 --> 01:37:59.830
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your.</v>

2153

<v Speaker 5>Wallachia.</v>

2154
01:38:03.490 --> 01:38:06.210
<v Speaker 5>We have this idea of what they are.</v>

01:38:14.431 --> 01:38:17.480
<v Speaker 5>We had to call one time for that when we</v>
<v Speaker 5>lived in that Spanish neighborhood.</v>

2160
01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:21.750

<v Speaker 5>It was waking everybody up fucking every</v>

2166
01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:39.150
<v Speaker 5>quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which might be a very good thing.</v>

<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2202

<v Speaker 5>It's to watch somebody watch one of </v>

2207
01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:41.790
<v Speaker 5>those shows and laugh.</v>

<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2210
01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:50.420
<v Speaker 5>like a show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like some sitcoms on TV and you're with </v>

<v Speaker 4>and they start really laughing at those </v>

<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

<v Speaker 5>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you could do it.</v>

2397
01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:21.291

2398
01:49:21.291 --> 01:49:24.351
<v Speaker 3>for that fast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should probably should be running </v>

2399
01:49:24.351 --> 01:49:24.430
<v Speaker 3>that fast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for a dummy like me or birds,</v>

2400
01:49:24.510 --> 01:49:25.860
<v Speaker 3>you're not training for a marathon </v>
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>

2403
01:49:32.340 --> 01:49:37.340
<v Speaker 3>you should do four hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could do for you a lot better than </v>

2404
01:49:37.340 --> 01:49:39.370
<v Speaker 3>average.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I flipped.</v>

2405
01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:41.910

<v Speaker 5>Let's be reasonable with each other.</v>

2410
01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:55.300
<v Speaker 5>That's an average runner and births </v>
<v Speaker 5>better than an average person to Ari.</v>

2411
01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:57.640
<v Speaker 5>It's right in front of our face.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm telling you.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Wait,</v>

2416
01:50:05.501 --> 01:50:07.900

<v Speaker 5>Twenty seven minutes.</v>

2417

<v Speaker 5>You can beat that by.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is.</v>

2418
01:50:09.750 --> 01:50:12.320
<v Speaker 5>I could probably.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You might be able to,</v>

2419
01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:13.450
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2421

<v Speaker 5>Austin,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Texas or some.</v>

2437
01:50:59.740 --> 01:51:02.140
<v Speaker 5>We find a place that we have a place we </v>
<v Speaker 5>could run.</v>

2438
01:51:02.170 --> 01:51:04.690
<v Speaker 5>I liked the sound of this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now we do a goddamn marathon.</v>

2439
01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:06.550

<v Speaker 5>This motherfucker has to win.</v>

2441
01:51:09.630 --> 01:51:10.460
<v Speaker 5>That's the way it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2442
01:51:10.550 --> 01:51:11.010
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2443
01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:13.940
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no marathon.</v>

2444
01:51:13.960 --> 01:51:16.060
<v Speaker 5>That's what's the bet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bird's gotta win this bet.</v>

2445
01:51:16.090 --> 01:51:16.760
<v Speaker 5>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>

2446
01:51:16.770 --> 01:51:20.140
<v Speaker 5>this proposition by beating Ari's dad's </v>
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>

2447
01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:23.260
<v Speaker 5>but here's the thing you think you can </v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2448
01:51:23.261 --> 01:51:25.970
<v Speaker 5>but this is like 15 yoga classes you </v>

<v Speaker 5>hours,</v>

2450
01:51:28.051 --> 01:51:29.920
<v Speaker 5>might be a 26 million.</v>

2451
01:51:29.950 --> 01:51:33.850
<v Speaker 5>How many people do it in?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Less than six hours.</v>

2452
01:51:33.851 --> 01:51:35.160
<v Speaker 5>Twice a ton.</v>
<v Speaker 5>About these people,</v>

2453
01:51:35.161 --> 01:51:37.240
<v Speaker 5>like their burden?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ninety five percent.</v>

<v Speaker 5>comedians.</v>

<v Speaker 5>If you say present out in front of the </v>

01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:52.210
<v Speaker 5>fucking Barney's beanery stretched for </v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

2459
01:51:52.270 --> 01:51:57.270

<v Speaker 5>You want to give you some old school </v>

2460
01:51:57.270 --> 01:51:57.400
<v Speaker 5>adidas and you're going to run.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you think you'll be able to do it?</v>

2461
01:51:57.460 --> 01:51:58.600
<v Speaker 5>That's a little tough right there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2462
01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:02.850
<v Speaker 5>A 500 would be 11 and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very.</v>

2463
01:52:02.980 --> 01:52:03.670
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hold on.</v>

2464
01:52:03.671 --> 01:52:04.840
<v Speaker 5>What'd already done?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Six,</v>

2465
01:52:04.841 --> 01:52:05.880
<v Speaker 5>six,</v>
<v Speaker 5>26.</v>

2466
01:52:06.130 --> 01:52:07.030
<v Speaker 5>Another hour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2467
01:52:07.031 --> 01:52:07.480
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2468
01:52:07.481 --> 01:52:07.820
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2469
01:52:07.821 --> 01:52:08.590
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's the thing.</v>

2470
01:52:08.750 --> 01:52:10.090
<v Speaker 5>A mile.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where I'm looking at.</v>

2471
01:52:10.091 --> 01:52:13.190
<v Speaker 5>This is cute.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's probably June 14th.</v>

2472
01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:18.900
<v Speaker 5>All that's cute.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The real number is you have to figure </v>

2473
01:52:18.900 --> 01:52:20.770
<v Speaker 5>out how to finish that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2474
01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:25.800
<v Speaker 5>That's the real number is not like how </v>
<v Speaker 5>fast you're going per mile because it's </v>

2475
01:52:25.811 --> 01:52:30.811
<v Speaker 5>not realistic because you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>get tired and the number is going to </v>

2476
01:52:30.811 --> 01:52:30.811
<v Speaker 5>drop off.</v>

2477
01:52:30.811 --> 01:52:32.020
<v Speaker 5>Substantially going to hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you say like seven minute mile,</v>

2478
01:52:32.021 --> 01:52:33.560
<v Speaker 5>I could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could do a seven minute I,</v>

2479
01:52:35.090 --> 01:52:37.530
<v Speaker 5>but you used to say that I can do what </v>
<v Speaker 5>we used to say.</v>

2480
01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:41.470
<v Speaker 5>Let's not say that anymore because you </v>
<v Speaker 5>were talking about a treadmill,</v>

2481
01:52:41.650 --> 01:52:44.650
<v Speaker 5>but if you say on the street you could </v>
<v Speaker 5>do one.</v>

2482
01:52:45.710 --> 01:52:50.710
<v Speaker 5>I got that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't do another 25 miles on top of </v>

2483
01:52:50.710 --> 01:52:54.080
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can do a five hour marathon.</v>

2484
01:52:54.330 --> 01:52:56.750
<v Speaker 5>I know I can get six hours and 26 </v>
<v Speaker 5>minutes.</v>

2485
01:52:56.900 --> 01:52:58.450
<v Speaker 5>No questions asked if that's what joe </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying.</v>

2486
01:52:58.470 --> 01:52:59.680
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm saying.</v>

2487
01:52:59.690 --> 01:53:00.920
<v Speaker 5>What I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just no way.</v>

2488
01:53:00.921 --> 01:53:03.650
<v Speaker 5>You could do all 26 miles the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could do one mile.</v>

2489
01:53:04.060 --> 01:53:07.640
<v Speaker 5>You'll will slow down you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll do one mile like an animal.</v>

2490
01:53:07.641 --> 01:53:11.660
<v Speaker 5>I fully believe you could do one mile on</v>
<v Speaker 5>the road in under seven minutes.</v>

2491
01:53:11.790 --> 01:53:14.290
<v Speaker 5>If you got fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You had a shot of espresso.</v>

2492
01:53:14.291 --> 01:53:14.870
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>

2493
01:53:15.560 --> 01:53:19.430
<v Speaker 5>That's why I'm looking at the per mile </v>
<v Speaker 5>times because if that,</v>

2494
01:53:19.610 --> 01:53:22.070
<v Speaker 5>if you're saying the six hour marathon </v>
<v Speaker 5>is 16 minutes,</v>

2495
01:53:22.180 --> 01:53:27.180
<v Speaker 5>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gets dark around 20 miles will tell you </v>

2496
01:53:27.180 --> 01:53:29.520
<v Speaker 5>this from Washington for much of my dead</v>
<v Speaker 5>15 years ago when they did the last </v>

2497
01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:29.520
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2498
01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:31.040
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we take the metro to different spots.</v>

2499
01:53:31.041 --> 01:53:33.020
<v Speaker 5>You can cheer them on and you'd get in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the back of the metro,</v>

2500
01:53:33.021 --> 01:53:34.760
<v Speaker 5>go to another place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>chairman again.</v>

2501
01:53:34.790 --> 01:53:36.800
<v Speaker 5>And the last spot we're supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 5>cheer them on.</v>

2502
01:53:36.801 --> 01:53:38.930
<v Speaker 5>We waited there for like 15 minutes and </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're like,</v>

2503
01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:40.010
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe we missed him.</v>

2504
01:53:40.340 --> 01:53:42.620
<v Speaker 5>He should've been here by now and we </v>
<v Speaker 5>wait another 10 minutes.</v>

2505
01:53:42.621 --> 01:53:46.040
<v Speaker 5>And then he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stumbling down at like mile 25.</v>

2506
01:53:46.041 --> 01:53:48.780
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck it.</v>

2507
01:53:48.830 --> 01:53:51.170
<v Speaker 5>Zombie walk the rest of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you telling me,</v>

2508
01:53:51.171 --> 01:53:53.450
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're telling me that my hips,</v>

2509
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:55.130
<v Speaker 5>our marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but no,</v>

2510
01:53:55.670 --> 01:53:57.650
<v Speaker 5>this is the reality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you got to hit a wall.</v>

2511
01:53:57.680 --> 01:54:00.200
<v Speaker 5>It feels.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It feels good to tell yourself.</v>

2512
01:54:01.410 --> 01:54:01.770
<v Speaker 7>Hold on</v>

2513
01:54:15.300 --> 01:54:20.300
<v Speaker 5>this bed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to find a defense to a bet </v>

2514
01:54:20.300 --> 01:54:20.300
<v Speaker 5>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2515
01:54:20.300 --> 01:54:24.951
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I'm a negotiated barker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to guess your weight for </v>

2516
01:54:24.951 --> 01:54:25.900
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For sure.</v>

2517
01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:30.920
<v Speaker 5>There's no question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obviously she was stealing money from </v>

2518
01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:33.921
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's how much less than 15 yoga classes </v>

2519
01:54:33.921 --> 01:54:34.430
<v Speaker 5>is hard but hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>five?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's the pace on a five hour marathon?</v>

2527
01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:50.380
<v Speaker 5>Don't look at the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait.</v>

2531
01:54:57.390 --> 01:55:02.390
<v Speaker 5>Eleven 30 is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is the pace for a five hour so you can </v>

2532
01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:05.790
<v Speaker 5>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eleven 30 is a tad bit quick.</v>

2533
01:55:06.290 --> 01:55:08.400
<v Speaker 5>Quick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You say now you don't think you could do</v>

2534
01:55:08.401 --> 01:55:10.080
<v Speaker 5>a five hour marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2536
01:55:13.231 --> 01:55:14.820
<v Speaker 5>But how much time would you need to </v>
<v Speaker 5>prepare?</v>

2537
01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:17.840
<v Speaker 5>The average time is three,</v>
<v Speaker 5>27 or 20 sites.</v>

2538
01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:20.150
<v Speaker 5>Let's say tomorrow morning you got to </v>

<v Speaker 5>What's that?</v>

2540
01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:23.820
<v Speaker 5>You got to cut 30 minutes off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Four and a half hours.</v>

2541
01:55:23.910 --> 01:55:24.590

<v Speaker 5>That's the prototype to production.</v>

2543
01:55:32.130 --> 01:55:33.960
<v Speaker 5>That's an interesting question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Attainable.</v>

2544
01:55:34.050 --> 01:55:35.970
<v Speaker 5>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chickens do a runner though,</v>

<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's a good.</v>

2553
01:55:51.900 --> 01:55:56.900
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could you do though have that Mickey </v>

2554
01:55:56.900 --> 01:55:59.150
<v Speaker 3>Mantle do you definitely have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You definitely have to have a job.</v>

2555
01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:04.160
<v Speaker 3>It means return.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You remember the UFC were mayhem fought </v>

2556
01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:07.530
<v Speaker 3>where mark layman was yelling out retard</v>
<v Speaker 3>strength.</v>

2557
01:56:08.980 --> 01:56:10.890
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a thing about like,</v>

2558
01:56:11.060 --> 01:56:14.970
<v Speaker 3>like mayhem Miller who's like one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those underrated mma fighters ever.</v>

2559
01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:20.120
<v Speaker 3>He was fucking super physically strong </v>
<v Speaker 3>and him and mark layman who was his </v>

2560
01:56:20.671 --> 01:56:23.310
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu coach is a famous judges who </v>
<v Speaker 3>coach in mma.</v>

2561
01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:26.330
<v Speaker 3>They had some weird thing they had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2562
01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:31.400
<v Speaker 3>I never asked them what the code was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they would yell out things like do </v>

2563
01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:34.731
<v Speaker 3>the Johnny Hendricks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there was a lot of times like </v>

2564
01:56:34.731 --> 01:56:36.770
<v Speaker 3>camps will develop codes so that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other team has no idea what's coming.</v>

2565
01:56:36.780 --> 01:56:39.660
<v Speaker 3>When you say the Johnny Hendricks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might be like an overhand left.</v>

2566
01:56:39.780 --> 01:56:42.780
<v Speaker 3>If you say the George St Pierre,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might be a superman punch,</v>

2567
01:56:42.900 --> 01:56:47.510
<v Speaker 3>like you have these weird code.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He's yelling out retard strength,</v>

2568
01:56:47.830 --> 01:56:50.640
<v Speaker 3>retard strength,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're on spike TV,</v>

2569
01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:53.250
<v Speaker 3>Spike TV,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I go,</v>

2570
01:56:53.251 --> 01:56:58.080
<v Speaker 3>I think he's yelling out retard to </v>
<v Speaker 3>retard,</v>

2571
01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:03.920
<v Speaker 3>retard strength.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was fighting George St Pierre to you </v>

2572
01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:03.920
<v Speaker 3>every time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spring for sure.</v>

2573
01:57:04.460 --> 01:57:05.390
<v Speaker 3>I think I was surprised.</v>

2574
01:57:07.460 --> 01:57:09.260
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>then we just very simply,</v>

2576
01:57:14.700 --> 01:57:19.700
<v Speaker 3>can you hold your breath and swim to one</v>
<v Speaker 3>side of the pool and neither of them </v>

2577
01:57:19.700 --> 01:57:19.700
<v Speaker 3>could do it now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>

2578
01:57:19.700 --> 01:57:22.040
<v Speaker 3>Both ways in the pool and I was both </v>
<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>

2579
01:57:22.100 --> 01:57:23.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm a champion.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He had never done it before my book.</v>

2581
01:57:27.390 --> 01:57:29.250
<v Speaker 3>Both my kids were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does he know how to swim?</v>

2582
01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:31.560
<v Speaker 3>Because he tried to swim on top of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>water,</v>

2583
01:57:31.561 --> 01:57:32.570
<v Speaker 3>slap in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were like,</v>

2584
01:57:32.580 --> 01:57:33.660
<v Speaker 3>Doug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you hold your breath,</v>

2585
01:57:33.661 --> 01:57:34.830

<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

<v Speaker 5>willing to run an extra two miles a day </v>

2740
02:05:11.720 --> 02:05:11.720

02:05:13.680 --> 02:05:14.910
<v Speaker 5>Spaghetti.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let's,</v>

2743
02:05:14.970 --> 02:05:19.970
<v Speaker 5>let's tear this bet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Telomere length that people are </v>

2744
02:05:19.970 --> 02:05:21.120

<v Speaker 5>if you do it 2010,</v>

2746
02:05:26.191 --> 02:05:27.670
<v Speaker 5>if you just lose a second four,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nine,</v>

2747
02:05:27.720 --> 02:05:29.520
<v Speaker 5>four and a half from our three and a </v>
<v Speaker 5>half mile loop.</v>

2748
02:05:29.580 --> 02:05:31.510
<v Speaker 5>You just keep running in a circle.</v>

2805
02:08:26.461 --> 02:08:28.170
<v Speaker 5>In physics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He put the glove on those hands.</v>

2811
02:08:40.680 --> 02:08:45.680
<v Speaker 6>to bring this back home to base.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Here's what I realized during sober </v>

2812
02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:46.290
<v Speaker 6>October,</v>
<v Speaker 6>October.</v>

2813
02:08:46.350 --> 02:08:50.190
<v Speaker 6>I don't need alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I like it.</v>

2814
02:08:50.250 --> 02:08:51.740
<v Speaker 6>It's great.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Kitten.</v>

2818
02:08:58.350 --> 02:09:03.000
<v Speaker 6>It's for me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's changed how my circuitry works,</v>

2819
02:09:03.380 --> 02:09:05.450
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's changed how I like uh,</v>

2820
02:09:05.510 --> 02:09:09.360
<v Speaker 6>how I communicated with people and I </v>
<v Speaker 6>think that there's a thing about alcohol</v>

2821
02:09:09.361 --> 02:09:11.580
<v Speaker 6>is like you pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2822
02:09:11.610 --> 02:09:13.720
<v Speaker 6>he definitely paid for it physically.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you,</v>

2823
02:09:14.190 --> 02:09:19.190
<v Speaker 6>there's like an exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The thing is to figure out what that </v>

2824
02:09:19.190 --> 02:09:19.190
<v Speaker 6>exchange is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's it,</v>

2825
02:09:19.190 --> 02:09:22.800
<v Speaker 6>what's it worth?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Getting really lit and having an amazing</v>

2826
02:09:22.801 --> 02:09:27.801
<v Speaker 6>time and hugging your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 6>telling him you love him and just hold </v>

2827
02:09:27.801 --> 02:09:27.870
<v Speaker 6>it and let.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let me tell you something.</v>

2828
02:09:28.140 --> 02:09:33.140
<v Speaker 6>I think to this day about one of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Times you and I got drunk together in </v>

2829
02:09:33.140 --> 02:09:33.140
<v Speaker 6>Texas.</v>

2830
02:09:33.140 --> 02:09:34.080
<v Speaker 6>We first started going on the road </v>
<v Speaker 6>together.</v>

2831
02:09:34.081 --> 02:09:39.081
<v Speaker 6>We'd be going on the road together like </v>
<v Speaker 6>a couple of years and we were in like a </v>

2832
02:09:39.081 --> 02:09:40.620
<v Speaker 6>honky tonk bar.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Remember that,</v>

2833
02:09:41.130 --> 02:09:43.530
<v Speaker 6>and was it Houston or Austin?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel.</v>

2834
02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:46.080
<v Speaker 6>I don't know why I thought it was </v>
<v Speaker 6>Louisville or something,</v>

2835
02:09:46.320 --> 02:09:51.320
<v Speaker 6>somewhere in Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sexist and we were hammered and were </v>

2836

02:09:52.860 --> 02:09:57.860
<v Speaker 6>And you said the same thing and like we </v>
<v Speaker 6>could say things that you always knew </v>

2839
02:09:57.860 --> 02:10:02.331
<v Speaker 6>that I appreciate you as a comedian and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you always knew that we were friendly </v>

2840
02:10:02.331 --> 02:10:05.910
<v Speaker 6>and we had some gigs together,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it took us getting drunk too.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean you'd obviously been doing comedy</v>

2863
02:11:04.561 --> 02:11:07.670
<v Speaker 1>a couple of years but you were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were trying to figure it out,</v>

2864
02:11:07.671 --> 02:11:09.470
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think about that.</v>

2865
02:11:09.471 --> 02:11:12.140
<v Speaker 1>I think about it too because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2866
02:11:12.410 --> 02:11:17.410
<v Speaker 1>it's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people don't realize the </v>

2867
02:11:17.410 --> 02:11:17.410
<v Speaker 1>opportunity when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

2868
02:11:17.410 --> 02:11:18.830
<v Speaker 1>when you kind of reach down and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring somebody along for that,</v>

2869
02:11:18.950 --> 02:11:22.010
<v Speaker 1>it's hard sometimes to convey like your </v>
<v Speaker 1>gratitude,</v>

2870
02:11:22.100 --> 02:11:23.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like that was one of those times were</v>

2871
02:11:23.961 --> 02:11:24.320
<v Speaker 1>like in.</v>

2872
02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:27.620
<v Speaker 1>So when you're sober you go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do thanks so much.</v>

2873
02:11:27.650 --> 02:11:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Like how many times you're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean,</v>

2874
02:11:29.331 --> 02:11:30.620
<v Speaker 1>like you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really appreciate it,</v>

2875
02:11:31.070 --> 02:11:35.870
<v Speaker 1>but when it goes back to like what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol kind of opens up for you is like</v>

2876
02:11:36.650 --> 02:11:41.650
<v Speaker 1>you let down your guard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you let down that you let the </v>

2877
02:11:41.650 --> 02:11:44.591
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability come to the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that was really for me </v>

2878
02:11:44.591 --> 02:11:48.430
<v Speaker 1>because I've thought about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the expression of gratitude </v>

2879
02:11:48.430 --> 02:11:50.450
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmed me because I realized how </v>
<v Speaker 1>lucky I was like you know,</v>

2880
02:11:50.451 --> 02:11:55.451
<v Speaker 1>you and any number of people can bring </v>
<v Speaker 1>along wherever they want on the road </v>

2881
02:11:55.451 --> 02:11:56.640
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like that for me was just like,</v>

2882
02:11:56.660 --> 02:12:01.660
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe how lucky I was to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to travel real shows,</v>

2883
02:12:02.270 --> 02:12:07.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do real shows with like these really </v>

2884
02:12:07.270 --> 02:12:09.920
<v Speaker 1>appreciative audiences and like you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing me along and like I feel like a</v>

2885
02:12:09.980 --> 02:12:10.910
<v Speaker 1>like an equal.</v>

2886
02:12:11.060 --> 02:12:12.520
<v Speaker 1>It was overwhelming to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2887
02:12:12.660 --> 02:12:13.680
<v Speaker 1>it was overwhelmed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

2888
02:12:13.700 --> 02:12:15.800
<v Speaker 1>you are an equal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all equal.</v>

2889
02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:18.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like we're all just like different </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of the road.</v>

2890
02:12:18.890 --> 02:12:21.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The road is the same road.</v>

2891
02:12:21.531 --> 02:12:23.040
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is going in,</v>

2892
02:12:23.200 --> 02:12:25.010
<v Speaker 1>but there's lessons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lessons from that,</v>

2893
02:12:25.011 --> 02:12:30.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's lessons that people are </v>

2894
02:12:30.011 --> 02:12:31.691
<v Speaker 1>willing to learn about themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They gotta they gotta be willing to </v>

2895
02:12:31.691 --> 02:12:34.430
<v Speaker 1>learn it themselves to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to know it encouraged,</v>

2896
02:12:34.460 --> 02:12:35.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>

2897
02:12:35.060 --> 02:12:38.780
<v Speaker 1>Just living through it encourages you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pass it along.</v>

2898
02:12:39.260 --> 02:12:41.420
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of the coolest part is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because like,</v>

2899
02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:45.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've really tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to mimic that.</v>

2900
02:12:45.380 --> 02:12:48.260
<v Speaker 1>I bring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I brought a bunch of guys most recently,</v>

2901
02:12:48.261 --> 02:12:53.261
<v Speaker 1>Josh Potter is this really funny dude </v>
<v Speaker 1>from buffalo and I brought them on most </v>

2902
02:12:53.691 --> 02:12:58.691
<v Speaker 1>of these dates and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a hookup that can't take care of </v>

2903
02:12:58.691 --> 02:13:00.650
<v Speaker 1>his travel to the ice house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2904
02:13:00.651 --> 02:13:01.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's a,</v>

2905
02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:02.720
<v Speaker 1>he's a great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just moved here.</v>

2906
02:13:02.800 --> 02:13:05.780
<v Speaker 1>He's just really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

2907
02:13:05.781 --> 02:13:07.160
<v Speaker 1>really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know red though,</v>

2908
02:13:07.250 --> 02:13:12.250
<v Speaker 1>one of the only times I ever cried on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the podcast was I'm listening to a </v>

2909
02:13:12.250 --> 02:13:15.980
<v Speaker 1>podcast where you were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>your and I relationship.</v>

2910
02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:20.270
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the few times I ever cried,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like listening to a podcast.</v>

2911
02:13:20.271 --> 02:13:20.690
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2912
02:13:20.691 --> 02:13:25.691
<v Speaker 1>this is like heavy emotional where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about like me and you </v>

2913
02:13:26.091 --> 02:13:28.370
<v Speaker 1>going on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in the early days,</v>

2914
02:13:28.940 --> 02:13:31.130
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing,</v>

2915
02:13:31.140 --> 02:13:31.650
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2916
02:13:32.910 --> 02:13:37.910
<v Speaker 6>It was your podcast where we did the </v>
<v Speaker 6>buck hunter podcast is the beginning of </v>

2917
02:13:38.230 --> 02:13:43.230
<v Speaker 6>the end where we were talking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You were talking about our relationship </v>

2918
02:13:44.311 --> 02:13:46.110
<v Speaker 6>when you first started out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

2919
02:13:46.670 --> 02:13:51.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was good to go from open mics to be </v>

2920
02:13:51.670 --> 02:13:51.670
<v Speaker 4>able to see like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you said,</v>

2921
02:13:51.670 --> 02:13:51.670
<v Speaker 4>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2922
02:13:51.670 --> 02:13:52.930
<v Speaker 4>this is like a real crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's here.</v>

2923
02:13:52.940 --> 02:13:53.960
<v Speaker 4>It's so big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People.</v>

2924
02:13:53.961 --> 02:13:57.230
<v Speaker 4>Some people never even get a taste of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that and then you'd come back.</v>

2925
02:13:57.430 --> 02:14:00.440
<v Speaker 4>I'd always try to go back on Sunday </v>
<v Speaker 4>night to the potluck.</v>

2926
02:14:00.510 --> 02:14:01.010
<v Speaker 4>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>

2927
02:14:01.070 --> 02:14:01.560
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2928
02:14:01.580 --> 02:14:05.060
<v Speaker 4>it was Sunday then and then it was like </v>
<v Speaker 4>to go back to dose of reality.</v>

2929
02:14:05.430 --> 02:14:07.370
<v Speaker 4>This sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I know I can do it now.</v>

2930
02:14:07.670 --> 02:14:08.510
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you,</v>

2931
02:14:08.570 --> 02:14:12.140
<v Speaker 6>you all knew.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody knows they kinda can do it.</v>

2932
02:14:12.170 --> 02:14:13.960
<v Speaker 6>That's why they're trying to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you need to.</v>

2933
02:14:13.970 --> 02:14:17.120
<v Speaker 6>Someone who's ahead of you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like holds a flashlight.</v>

2934
02:14:17.140 --> 02:14:17.990
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>come on,</v>

2935
02:14:18.020 --> 02:14:19.400
<v Speaker 6>take a look at this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Come on.</v>

2936
02:14:19.430 --> 02:14:21.050
<v Speaker 6>We're all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Keep going,</v>

2937
02:14:21.170 --> 02:14:26.170
<v Speaker 6>keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like when you took me to laugh and </v>

2938
02:14:26.170 --> 02:14:27.701
<v Speaker 6>limited and I bombed in front of you for</v>
<v Speaker 6>like our.</v>

2939
02:14:32.921 --> 02:14:37.921
<v Speaker 6>He didn't know you from the time where I</v>
<v Speaker 6>first met you to you having your own </v>

2940
02:14:37.921 --> 02:14:39.230
<v Speaker 6>comedy central show to having your own </v>
<v Speaker 6>Netflix special,</v>

2941
02:14:39.231 --> 02:14:44.231
<v Speaker 6>which is double special.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Special two hours you had to do to you </v>

2942
02:14:44.231 --> 02:14:44.510
<v Speaker 6>pretentious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck.</v>

2943
02:14:44.530 --> 02:14:47.390
<v Speaker 6>Or 45.</v>
<v Speaker 6>40th five enough.</v>

2944
02:14:48.860 --> 02:14:52.280
<v Speaker 6>Still half hour more than anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it was still.</v>

2945
02:14:52.281 --> 02:14:53.330
<v Speaker 6>It was like wow.</v>

2946
02:14:53.420 --> 02:14:54.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird when you can set your reality</v>

2947
02:14:54.951 --> 02:14:58.400
<v Speaker 4>one way and then it just slowly change </v>
<v Speaker 4>over time.</v>

2948
02:14:58.410 --> 02:15:00.970
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that's what we.</v>

2949
02:15:01.250 --> 02:15:05.630
<v Speaker 6>It seems counterintuitive because you </v>
<v Speaker 6>seem like you're trying to hold down the</v>

2950
02:15:05.631 --> 02:15:10.631
<v Speaker 6>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The problem is if you hold down a </v>

2951
02:15:10.631 --> 02:15:11.300
<v Speaker 6>competition,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you inevitably hold on yourself.</v>

2952
02:15:11.330 --> 02:15:12.500
<v Speaker 6>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't mean to.</v>

2953
02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:14.750
<v Speaker 6>You're the barstow lower.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not just that.</v>

2954
02:15:14.780 --> 02:15:16.460
<v Speaker 6>It's like you're looking at it the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 6>way.</v>

2955
02:15:16.610 --> 02:15:19.070
<v Speaker 6>So one of the reasons why I always took </v>
<v Speaker 6>killers on the road,</v>

2956
02:15:19.210 --> 02:15:23.030
<v Speaker 6>the other tough dude I used to take Joey</v>
<v Speaker 6>Diaz,</v>

2957
02:15:23.270 --> 02:15:25.100
<v Speaker 6>we took Duncan,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we took Ari.</v>

2958
02:15:25.310 --> 02:15:27.620
<v Speaker 6>Like I always took murderers on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>road.</v>

2959
02:15:27.680 --> 02:15:30.540
<v Speaker 6>Anybody following bringing electively,</v>
<v Speaker 6>bringing Joe.</v>

2960
02:15:30.541 --> 02:15:30.850
<v Speaker 6>He is.</v>

2961
02:15:32.830 --> 02:15:35.680
<v Speaker 4>It was me up for the longest time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Me Then Diaz the rogue,</v>

2962
02:15:35.690 --> 02:15:38.320
<v Speaker 4>a great show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then it was in Austin.</v>

2963
02:15:38.790 --> 02:15:39.580
<v Speaker 4>Diaz goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2964
02:15:39.581 --> 02:15:41.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go first today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to go last second.</v>

2965
02:15:41.941 --> 02:15:45.370
<v Speaker 4>I mean I didn't know it was just he </v>
<v Speaker 4>likes to go to sleep,</v>

2966
02:15:45.670 --> 02:15:47.110
<v Speaker 4>but then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>am I being punished?</v>

2967
02:15:47.111 --> 02:15:47.650
<v Speaker 4>What did I do?</v>

2968
02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:49.990
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't do anything.</v>

2969
02:15:50.360 --> 02:15:53.440
<v Speaker 6>It's terrible place to be following joey</v>
<v Speaker 6>in less.</v>

2970
02:15:53.470 --> 02:15:56.080
<v Speaker 6>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The thing is if you embrace.</v>

2971
02:15:56.330 --> 02:16:01.330
<v Speaker 6>It was a good crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm the number one Joey Diaz Fan in the </v>

2972
02:16:01.330 --> 02:16:03.490
<v Speaker 6>world other than his wife and his </v>
<v Speaker 6>daughter.</v>

2973
02:16:04.220 --> 02:16:06.520
<v Speaker 6>It's like there's like everybody else is</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2974
02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:12.000
<v Speaker 6>if you might be the same but you </v>
<v Speaker 6>definitely don't love him more than I </v>

2975
02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:13.200
<v Speaker 6>do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So for me it was like taking that gun in</v>

2976
02:16:13.201 --> 02:16:15.730
<v Speaker 6>the road.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like I want to see him.</v>

2977

<v Speaker 6>stand up long enough.</v>

2978
02:16:18.671 --> 02:16:20.320
<v Speaker 6>If you embrace the person in front of </v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

<v Speaker 6>what people feel is you being nervous </v>

2982
02:16:29.190 --> 02:16:31.120
<v Speaker 6>and fearful if you're like,</v>

2990
02:16:53.471 --> 02:16:55.870
<v Speaker 6>whatever the fuck I was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I might've been younger.</v>

2991
02:16:56.080 --> 02:17:01.000
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know shit and Jim and I were </v>

3024
02:18:35.890 --> 02:18:35.890
<v Speaker 4>a plane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

<v Speaker 4>nights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3029
02:18:44.710 --> 02:18:45.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3030
02:18:45.150 --> 02:18:47.550
<v Speaker 4>I went to the end of every night at </v>
<v Speaker 4>Boston comedy club.</v>

3031
02:18:47.551 --> 02:18:50.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know,</v>

3032
02:18:50.680 --> 02:18:53.290
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt like if you embrace the energy,</v>

3033
02:18:53.291 --> 02:18:56.050
<v Speaker 4>you could always move it forward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember having a follow Billy Gardell</v>

3034
02:18:56.080 --> 02:19:00.310
<v Speaker 4>on the Jamison comedy tour and billy was</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a road destroyer,</v>

3035
02:19:00.830 --> 02:19:04.810
<v Speaker 4>just like he would have everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember when we used to follow,</v>

3036
02:19:04.811 --> 02:19:08.980
<v Speaker 4>when we used to work with Jay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jay would do an hour and then I close it</v>

3037
02:19:08.981 --> 02:19:10.570
<v Speaker 4>and do 30,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is by the way,</v>

3038
02:19:10.571 --> 02:19:15.571
<v Speaker 4>the craziest fucking thing I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>heard and I didn't hear it until last </v>

3039
02:19:15.571 --> 02:19:17.230
<v Speaker 4>week when you toe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When he told me that the order that they</v>

3040
02:19:17.240 --> 02:19:22.240
<v Speaker 4>would wait.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you say Jay would do an hour and </v>

3041
02:19:22.240 --> 02:19:22.590
<v Speaker 4>then he would close close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would he?</v>

3042
02:19:22.630 --> 02:19:23.500
<v Speaker 4>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was.</v>

3043
02:19:23.590 --> 02:19:26.440
<v Speaker 4>It was after he had come back from not </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing like,</v>

3044
02:19:26.990 --> 02:19:28.070
<v Speaker 4>he didn't always do</v>

3045
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:30.230
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he took time off of standup.</v>

3046
02:19:30.260 --> 02:19:32.100
<v Speaker 3>You're a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then he came.</v>

3047
02:19:32.140 --> 02:19:33.260

<v Speaker 3>Tom.</v>

3048
02:19:33.320 --> 02:19:35.000

<v Speaker 3>came back.</v>

3049
02:19:35.540 --> 02:19:36.740
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just fucking hammered.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He came back after like not doing </v>

3051
02:19:41.870 --> 02:19:44.220
<v Speaker 3>standup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So either.</v>

3052
02:19:44.300 --> 02:19:49.300

<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying that I've never heard </v>

02:25:52.210 --> 02:25:57.210
<v Speaker 6>knocked drunk so to finally never,</v>
<v Speaker 6>never dropped off.</v>

3196
02:26:06.570 --> 02:26:09.730
<v Speaker 6>I'm just being honest because Aryan.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I actually had a discussion about it.</v>

3197
02:26:10.270 --> 02:26:12.820
<v Speaker 6>I got legitimately nervous when we were </v>
<v Speaker 6>on the podcast.</v>

3198
02:26:12.821 --> 02:26:16.330
<v Speaker 6>You said you drink six doubles a day?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got super nervous,</v>

<v Speaker 6>It is a lot,</v>

3200
02:26:19.300 --> 02:26:24.300
<v Speaker 6>but this is why I got nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not just because I love you and I want </v>

3201
02:26:24.300 --> 02:26:24.430
<v Speaker 6>you to be healthy,</v>

02:26:24.431 --> 02:26:29.431
<v Speaker 6>I don't think you need to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if you had a drink a day or two </v>

3203
02:26:29.431 --> 02:26:32.800
<v Speaker 6>drinks a day or three drinks a day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he'd probably be fine.</v>

02:26:33.460 --> 02:26:35.980
<v Speaker 6>Like you're.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You give your liver enough slack?</v>

<v Speaker 6>Me and Owen Benjamin did a poc high.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Not Different for you at all?</v>

3221
02:27:18.420 --> 02:27:19.770
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the first time I got high alone,</v>

3222
02:27:19.771 --> 02:27:22.080
<v Speaker 6>not drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We drank and we added some,</v>

3223
02:27:22.170 --> 02:27:27.170
<v Speaker 6>some bloods and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People around bloods I think even you </v>

3224
02:27:27.170 --> 02:27:31.011
<v Speaker 6>out because it's kind of a stimulant.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I didn't smoke blunts until I hung </v>

3225
02:27:31.011 --> 02:27:31.470
<v Speaker 6>out with Charlie Murphy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>

3226
02:27:31.560 --> 02:27:34.010
<v Speaker 6>Charlie used to smoke legit blunts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like kid,</v>

3227
02:27:34.050 --> 02:27:38.280
<v Speaker 6>his cousin rich who had rolled these </v>
<v Speaker 6>legit blondes out of Swisher sweets.</v>

3228
02:27:38.990 --> 02:27:43.990
<v Speaker 6>Take out the tobacco leaves like a </v>
<v Speaker 6>little bit in and then roll it up with </v>

3229
02:27:43.990 --> 02:27:45.060
<v Speaker 6>weed and then lick it down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And we would get</v>

3230
02:27:47.190 --> 02:27:49.870
<v Speaker 8>tobacco.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3232
02:27:51.250 --> 02:27:56.250
<v Speaker 6>Terrifying high.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was one of the hardest deaths that I </v>

3233
02:27:56.250 --> 02:27:56.590
<v Speaker 6>ever had to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>

3234
02:27:56.770 --> 02:27:59.830
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because I wish I contacted him more.</v>

3235
02:27:59.831 --> 02:28:02.050
<v Speaker 6>I wish we got together more,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but we were always on the road.</v>

3236
02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:05.200
<v Speaker 6>Like that guy's a man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like he was a,</v>

3237
02:28:05.230 --> 02:28:07.260
<v Speaker 6>he was a real man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3238
02:28:07.330 --> 02:28:12.330
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like he never had any like weird shit </v>

3239
02:28:12.330 --> 02:28:12.330
<v Speaker 6>yet to work through.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was,</v>

3240
02:28:12.330 --> 02:28:16.030
<v Speaker 6>he always held his mud,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like trolley was different man.</v>

3241
02:28:16.060 --> 02:28:19.540
<v Speaker 6>He was like a guy who didn't come into </v>
<v Speaker 6>celebrity at all until his forties.</v>

3242
02:28:19.680 --> 02:28:23.450
<v Speaker 6>So he's developed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was a real man that love that guy.</v>

3243
02:28:23.451 --> 02:28:27.050
<v Speaker 6>So it's one of those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like sometimes you get,</v>

<v Speaker 6>That guy was a good dude.</v>

3248
02:28:37.700 --> 02:28:39.970
<v Speaker 6>Like Charlie Murphy was a good </v>
<v Speaker 6>motherfucker.</v>

3249
02:28:40.120 --> 02:28:44.780
<v Speaker 6>I can't have joke onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The talked about it wasn't trying to,</v>

3250
02:28:45.050 --> 02:28:46.250
<v Speaker 6>but he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he goes,</v>

3251

<v Speaker 6>it's someone just yells out,</v>

3255
02:28:56.151 --> 02:28:58.340
<v Speaker 6>Charlie Murphy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Every time he seen he goes,</v>

3256
02:28:58.580 --> 02:28:59.870
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

3257
02:28:59.990 --> 02:29:02.840
<v Speaker 6>because for the first time in my life it</v>
<v Speaker 6>wasn't like,</v>

3258
02:29:02.841 --> 02:29:05.360
<v Speaker 6>hey you Eddie Murphy's brother.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3259
02:29:06.270 --> 02:29:11.270
<v Speaker 6>And even laugh about it onstage,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like slap as an a and that was real for </v>

3260
02:29:11.301 --> 02:29:11.960
<v Speaker 6>him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

3261
02:29:12.110 --> 02:29:17.110
<v Speaker 6>We got to experience a guy who like went</v>
<v Speaker 6>through a whole life as a grown man and </v>

3262
02:29:17.451 --> 02:29:22.451
<v Speaker 6>was approaching middle age before fame </v>
<v Speaker 6>kicked in and he only had like a 10,</v>

3263
02:29:22.641 --> 02:29:27.641
<v Speaker 6>15 year ride before he died.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was a good dude man.</v>

3264
02:29:27.750 --> 02:29:30.980
<v Speaker 6>The magnitude of like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know that show,</v>

3265
02:29:31.010 --> 02:29:33.650
<v Speaker 6>but like particularly like to sketches.</v>

3266
02:29:33.980 --> 02:29:38.480
<v Speaker 6>Like that's how big an impact those two </v>
<v Speaker 6>sketches he was,</v>

3267
02:29:38.780 --> 02:29:41.450
<v Speaker 6>he would just play that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I remember when he started a tour,</v>

3268
02:29:41.810 --> 02:29:43.760
<v Speaker 6>you know when you go to the clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they played it before.</v>

3269
02:29:43.790 --> 02:29:44.380
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just that,</v>

3270
02:29:44.410 --> 02:29:49.410
<v Speaker 6>that like the teaser that he's coming,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's coming next week or two weeks and </v>

3271
02:29:49.410 --> 02:29:52.391
<v Speaker 6>then will be just like a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 6>like the Rick James Sketch or the print </v>

3272
02:29:52.391 --> 02:29:54.710
<v Speaker 6>separate and fucking all the shows sold </v>
<v Speaker 6>out.</v>

3273
02:29:56.330 --> 02:29:57.110
<v Speaker 6>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

3274
02:29:57.111 --> 02:29:59.740
<v Speaker 6>he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

3275
02:29:59.900 --> 02:30:04.900
<v Speaker 6>I really feel like there's a </v>
<v Speaker 6>developmental process that you could </v>

3276
02:30:04.900 --> 02:30:06.350
<v Speaker 6>apply to like UFC fighters and even </v>
<v Speaker 6>stand up comedians.</v>

3277
02:30:06.590 --> 02:30:08.990
<v Speaker 6>If you take a guy who's got some </v>
<v Speaker 6>potential,</v>

3278
02:30:09.090 --> 02:30:14.090
<v Speaker 6>then you make them fight Anderson Silva </v>
<v Speaker 6>and his prime when he was 20 years old </v>

3279
02:30:14.090 --> 02:30:16.310
<v Speaker 6>and it gets knocked unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's never going to be the same again.</v>

3280
02:30:16.340 --> 02:30:21.340
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I almost feel like it's the same </v>

3281
02:30:21.340 --> 02:30:21.340
<v Speaker 6>thing with comedians.</v>

3282
02:30:21.340 --> 02:30:24.070
<v Speaker 6>I don't care if you're 40 or 50 or 60 or</v>
<v Speaker 6>20 to go on stage and eat dick is </v>

3283
02:30:24.350 --> 02:30:29.350
<v Speaker 6>horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And what Charlie did was he went from </v>

3284
02:30:29.350 --> 02:30:33.221
<v Speaker 6>being a guy who was on the Chappelle </v>
<v Speaker 6>show to hosting a show with other </v>

3285

<v Speaker 6>whoever was on the show and talking a </v>

<v Speaker 6>And instead of just continuing to do </v>

3288
02:30:43.421 --> 02:30:43.421
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he started headlining because that where</v>

<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>he could do pretty good.</v>

<v Speaker 3>was crying too.</v>

3444
02:38:06.991 --> 02:38:11.991
<v Speaker 3>But I was probably under the table at </v>
<v Speaker 3>this point just because I did that </v>

3445
02:38:12.661 --> 02:38:17.661
<v Speaker 3>podcast with Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like the same sort of situation </v>

3446
02:38:17.661 --> 02:38:19.200
<v Speaker 3>under the table crying at that point </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

3451
02:38:28.570 --> 02:38:30.830
<v Speaker 3>The quicker you realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the quicker you get that in your head,</v>

3452
02:38:30.860 --> 02:38:35.860
<v Speaker 3>the more you'll enjoy this weird time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're in the sunshine right after the </v>

3453
02:38:35.860 --> 02:38:36.440
<v Speaker 3>rain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't last.</v>

3454
02:38:36.740 --> 02:38:39.080

3455
02:38:39.590 --> 02:38:41.990
<v Speaker 3>but as the human race,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a person,</v>

<v Speaker 3>all of us,</v>

<v Speaker 3>We remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The better we'll all be does not work.</v>

3483
02:40:05.340 --> 02:40:05.340
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was that fat bird pusher.</v>

<v Speaker 5>We don't have any stake in this.</v>

3495
02:40:35.160 --> 02:40:40.160
<v Speaker 5>Like physically.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm uncomfortable with that because I </v>

3496
02:40:40.160 --> 02:40:40.870
<v Speaker 5>feel like we're bullying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh No,</v>

<v Speaker 5>This is what we did.</v>

3535
02:42:23.971 --> 02:42:26.130
<v Speaker 5>We do so incredibly physically </v>
<v Speaker 5>intensive,</v>

3536
02:42:26.131 --> 02:42:28.860
<v Speaker 5>but we do it hammered.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean hammered.</v>

3537

<v Speaker 5>through a marathon.</v>

3547
02:43:00.540 --> 02:43:01.710
<v Speaker 5>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it was flat,</v>

3548
02:43:02.310 --> 02:43:03.670
<v Speaker 5>flat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>flat,</v>

3549
02:43:08.640 --> 02:43:09.030
<v Speaker 5>flat.</v>

3550

<v Speaker 5>it's downhill.</v>

3551
02:43:12.610 --> 02:43:16.000

<v Speaker 5>I mean it might be that one.</v>

3552
02:43:16.001 --> 02:43:19.840
<v Speaker 5>That was a track.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't.</v>

3553
02:43:20.170 --> 02:43:22.140
<v Speaker 5>You don't think he can beat you on </v>
<v Speaker 5>roller skates.</v>

3554
02:43:24.610 --> 02:43:26.740
<v Speaker 5>Who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's make the bet.</v>

<v Speaker 5>speed skater.</v>

3558
02:43:42.190 --> 02:43:47.190
<v Speaker 5>That's that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's different than what you're </v>

3559
02:43:47.190 --> 02:43:47.190
<v Speaker 5>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but here's the thing.</v>

<v Speaker 5>which is very lucky when that is </v>

3562
02:43:56.641 --> 02:43:58.390
<v Speaker 5>salaries you win.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How would you when you quit?</v>

<v Speaker 5>ain't shit man.</v>

3569
02:44:16.300 --> 02:44:17.950
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been like,</v>

3570
02:44:18.190 --> 02:44:19.590
<v Speaker 5>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

<v Speaker 5>His thighs will get burnt.</v>

3572
02:44:24.370 --> 02:44:29.370
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do this and when you have the slightest </v>

3573
02:44:29.370 --> 02:44:33.481
<v Speaker 5>uphill and he's walking in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how are we gonna do it was a flat track </v>

3574
02:44:33.760 --> 02:44:37.870
<v Speaker 5>to this track.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jamie the Turkey stuff on the beach like</v>

3575
02:44:37.880 --> 02:44:42.880
<v Speaker 5>right on the roller skating marathon </v>
<v Speaker 5>back to snoop dogg.</v>

3576
02:44:43.031 --> 02:44:44.910
<v Speaker 5>If it's uphill,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's slightly uphill and it's.</v>

3577
02:44:45.070 --> 02:44:49.960
<v Speaker 5>But it's much more exhausting to </v>
<v Speaker 5>rollerskate uphill by the way.</v>

3578
02:44:49.961 --> 02:44:53.160
<v Speaker 5>It's so much easier on the downhill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sliding downhill.</v>

3579
02:44:53.200 --> 02:44:55.390
<v Speaker 5>The other West Skating Twenty six point </v>
<v Speaker 5>two miles,</v>

3580
02:44:55.391 --> 02:45:00.391
<v Speaker 5>42 point two kilometers is undoubtedly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Undoubtedly he's skating and roller </v>

3581
02:45:03.070 --> 02:45:06.710
<v Speaker 5>blades or roller skates.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is roller.</v>

3582
02:45:06.760 --> 02:45:09.620
<v Speaker 5>The roller blades requested.</v>

3583
02:45:13.670 --> 02:45:17.940
<v Speaker 5>Kiana skates are fair,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but roller blades aren't fail.</v>

3584
02:45:19.200 --> 02:45:22.370
<v Speaker 5>Ever Seen Bret Ernst Act.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's roller skating.</v>

3585
02:45:22.480 --> 02:45:23.380
<v Speaker 5>Roller skating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3586
02:45:23.381 --> 02:45:26.890
<v Speaker 5>That guy could beat you in a run.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think your mic here under hearing me,</v>

3587
02:45:26.980 --> 02:45:31.980
<v Speaker 5>it's easier on roller blades.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Roller skates is the hardest time with </v>

3588
02:45:31.980 --> 02:45:35.470
<v Speaker 5>four wheels roller.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tom Skeet speedskating.</v>

3589
02:45:35.471 --> 02:45:38.890
<v Speaker 5>They do go fast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm rolling too fast.</v>

3590
02:45:38.891 --> 02:45:40.690
<v Speaker 5>It's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did my Uber's here.</v>

3591
02:45:43.180 --> 02:45:44.950
<v Speaker 5>How about this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bet on Tom.</v>

3592
02:45:45.100 --> 02:45:48.160
<v Speaker 5>If you are on a scale or skates,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to beat him by half.</v>

3593
02:45:48.310 --> 02:45:49.960
<v Speaker 5>Not just beat up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Beat up.</v>

3594
02:45:50.450 --> 02:45:54.830
<v Speaker 5>Just being beaten is easy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but real acquit.</v>

3595
02:45:54.850 --> 02:45:57.940
<v Speaker 5>He's confident.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You think real quick.</v>

3596
02:45:59.890 --> 02:46:03.530
<v Speaker 5>Do you know I'm going right now to buy </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking another pair of roller skates.</v>

3597
02:46:04.780 --> 02:46:09.780
<v Speaker 5>He ain't gonna run it and I thought this</v>
<v Speaker 5>through for me</v>

3598
02:46:10.610 --> 02:46:15.140
<v Speaker 3>and I wondered if I could beat myself </v>
<v Speaker 3>rollerskating a marathon and I was like,</v>

3599
02:46:15.170 --> 02:46:16.820
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're forgetting.</v>

<v Speaker 3>fatigue.</v>

3601
02:46:19.200 --> 02:46:19.650
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

3602
02:46:19.720 --> 02:46:24.720
<v Speaker 3>you're choosing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fatigue is totally different than </v>

3603
02:46:24.720 --> 02:46:24.720
<v Speaker 3>jogging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3604
02:46:24.720 --> 02:46:28.450
<v Speaker 3>like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go a little faster and you get some </v>

3605
02:46:28.450 --> 02:46:28.450
<v Speaker 3>downhills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you also have appeals,</v>

3606
02:46:28.450 --> 02:46:28.640
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's the way you can roll it out.</v>

3610
02:46:43.480 --> 02:46:45.200
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a fair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm quitting.</v>

3611
02:46:45.201 --> 02:46:46.670
<v Speaker 3>Is a real possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cars here.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm going home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Start paying them down.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They're going to be in my role as kids.</v>

3615

<v Speaker 3>I think you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't quit,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He gets a razor rollerskates.</v>

3617
02:47:00.960 --> 02:47:02.270
<v Speaker 3>Let's and let's not be hasty.</v>

3618
02:47:02.270 --> 02:47:04.880
<v Speaker 3>This is a long podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's think this.</v>

3619
02:47:04.940 --> 02:47:08.570
<v Speaker 3>This has real merit to another podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ours going back to New York.</v>

3620
02:47:08.571 --> 02:47:10.130
<v Speaker 3>We can skype,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can skype it.</v>

3621
02:47:10.150 --> 02:47:12.420
<v Speaker 3>Local board.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a skype or we it.</v>

3622
02:47:12.900 --> 02:47:13.730
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we'll skype.</v>

3623
02:47:13.731 --> 02:47:16.550
<v Speaker 3>It will have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The three of us will get together.</v>

3624
02:47:16.551 --> 02:47:18.770
<v Speaker 3>We'll skype Ren.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll put them on the big screen.</v>

3625
02:47:18.860 --> 02:47:23.860
<v Speaker 3>We'll work this out special now and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is what I feel.</v>

3626
02:47:26.331 --> 02:47:29.120
<v Speaker 3>I feel like the first time it worked out</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>

3627
02:47:29.420 --> 02:47:29.930
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

3628
02:47:29.980 --> 02:47:31.640
<v Speaker 3>we didn't really have it ironed out </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

3629
02:47:31.641 --> 02:47:33.740
<v Speaker 3>We ran off to our 15 yoga classes in </v>
<v Speaker 3>our.</v>

3630
02:47:33.741 --> 02:47:37.820
<v Speaker 3>No alcohol and no stove.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't have any stakes.</v>

3631
02:47:38.030 --> 02:47:39.580
<v Speaker 3>I think this time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

3632
02:47:39.710 --> 02:47:43.460
<v Speaker 3>let's give this a time for a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking assholes to chime in online.</v>

3633
02:47:43.610 --> 02:47:48.610
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch bunch of us to sit around and </v>

3634
02:47:48.610 --> 02:47:48.610
<v Speaker 3>think about devious ways we could trick </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other to do it.</v>

3635
02:47:48.610 --> 02:47:52.190
<v Speaker 3>Something that seems okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really more difficult.</v>

3636
02:47:52.340 --> 02:47:55.400
<v Speaker 3>Like per pete and Tom and I'm being so </v>
<v Speaker 3>nice,</v>

3637
02:47:55.490 --> 02:47:59.270
<v Speaker 3>but not even suggesting you beating him </v>
<v Speaker 3>by running him on skates.</v>

3638
02:47:59.480 --> 02:48:01.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even suggesting that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just ridiculous,</v>

3639
02:48:02.360 --> 02:48:06.140
<v Speaker 3>but I'm thinking maybe like half,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe half as the real bet.</v>

3640
02:48:06.590 --> 02:48:07.730
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The giotto things,</v>

3641
02:48:07.731 --> 02:48:12.731
<v Speaker 3>any way you'll lose way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way to just in 15 years,</v>

3642
02:48:16.730 --> 02:48:21.730
<v Speaker 3>straight hours not quitting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A two and a half hours to I'm going to </v>

3643
02:48:21.730 --> 02:48:21.730
<v Speaker 3>get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm high as fuck.</v>

3644
02:48:21.730 --> 02:48:25.810
<v Speaker 3>He's going to be thinking about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe to steroids and electromagnetic</v>

3645
02:48:25.850 --> 02:48:30.850
<v Speaker 3>fields.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it all comes down to whether or not </v>

3646
02:48:30.850 --> 02:48:30.850
<v Speaker 3>who's gonna tire out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to get hot and retires out.</v>

3647
02:48:30.850 --> 02:48:34.970
<v Speaker 3>He's got no heart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no heart every 30 yards a vaporizer.</v>

3648
02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.460
<v Speaker 3>If there's no quit in Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no way he won't feature.</v>

3649
02:48:37.850 --> 02:48:38.690
<v Speaker 3>I have A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3650

<v Speaker 3>quit.</v>

3651
02:48:40.570 --> 02:48:43.580
<v Speaker 3>He'll quit quitting wheels are faster </v>
<v Speaker 3>than not wheels squealing.</v>

3652
02:48:43.910 --> 02:48:44.180
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3653
02:48:44.181 --> 02:48:44.930
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

3654
02:48:45.040 --> 02:48:45.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if he.</v>

3655
02:48:45.980 --> 02:48:47.780
<v Speaker 3>If he quits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is partly possible,</v>

3656
02:48:48.450 --> 02:48:53.450
<v Speaker 3>birth things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's holding onto some logical linchpin </v>

3657

<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell us,</v>

<v Speaker 3>why you think it'll definitely go your </v>

3659
02:48:56.890 --> 02:48:58.210
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll have many reason not fatigue.</v>

3660
