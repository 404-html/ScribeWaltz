<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

13

18
00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:42.370
<v Speaker 1>The mountains up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the scenery was just stunning.</v>

19
00:00:42.371 --> 00:00:44.350
<v Speaker 1>Like everywhere you look,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the mountains that they live in there,</v>

23
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.840
<v Speaker 1>they're rugged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're beautiful.</v>

24
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.970
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>moments with elk that I couldn't film </v>

37
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.233
<v Speaker 1>because it was just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just so engrossed in the idea of </v>

38
00:01:27.251 --> 00:01:28.084
<v Speaker 1>like getting it done and the hunting </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect of it that I didn't want to pull </v>

<v Speaker 1>my phone out and be taken pictures in </v>
<v Speaker 1>five minutes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

41
00:01:35.621 --> 00:01:36.454
<v Speaker 1>I took a few here and there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there were so many moments that I'm </v>

42
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.830
<v Speaker 1>so glad that under armour filmed this </v>

46
00:01:49.511 --> 00:01:50.344
<v Speaker 1>and maybe just get a tiny sense of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>we talk about when we talk about how </v>

47
00:01:53.531 --> 00:01:55.310
<v Speaker 1>amazing it is to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

48
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.810
<v Speaker 1>and we had the right guys filming it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

49
00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:59.763
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of different levels </v>

50
00:02:00.671 --> 00:02:01.840
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially hunting films.</v>

51
00:02:01.841 --> 00:02:03.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's guys out there just with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a handicap,</v>

52
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.763
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just trying to do the best I can to </v>

53
00:02:05.471 --> 00:02:06.304
<v Speaker 1>share their experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's guys like mark womack </v>

54
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.910
<v Speaker 1>and his crew with sub seven that make </v>
<v Speaker 1>films.</v>

55
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.240
<v Speaker 1>he's filling me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

57
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.533
<v Speaker 1>there's an episode called Roy's Buck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a whitetail hunting Colorado the time </v>

58
00:02:21.521 --> 00:02:23.230
<v Speaker 1>episode time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

59
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.180
<v Speaker 1>that one's amazing time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really good.</v>

60
00:02:25.181 --> 00:02:28.120
<v Speaker 1>Oregon el Con.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those are not just your typical,</v>

61
00:02:28.121 --> 00:02:30.040
<v Speaker 1>what people might think of as a hunting </v>
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>

62
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.630
<v Speaker 1>Those were just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.760
<v Speaker 1>or hunting video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are true films.</v>

64
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a short film and it,</v>

65
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.873
<v Speaker 1>it's really like almost like a mini </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary of how you're trying to </v>

66
00:02:39.971 --> 00:02:40.804
<v Speaker 1>balance your life and training and </v>
<v Speaker 1>running and competing these ultra </v>

67
00:02:43.931 --> 00:02:44.764
<v Speaker 1>marathons and then also working a full </v>
<v Speaker 1>time job and then also going out and go </v>

68
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.011
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

69
00:02:49.011 --> 00:02:49.520
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

70
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.530
<v Speaker 1>it's really well done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those same guys filmed us.</v>

71
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:54.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

72
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.220
<v Speaker 1>we got some epic footage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just epic.</v>

73
00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:58.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

74
00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>and like you hopefully gives</v>

75
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.760
<v Speaker 2>a glimpse for people that haven't </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced at or aren't hunters.</v>

76
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:04.603
<v Speaker 2>Maybe just to see I'm at everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's involved in the hunt and you </v>

77
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:09.980
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how powerful it is and,</v>

78
00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:10.814
<v Speaker 2>and just to add the wild animals out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there interacting with each other and </v>

79
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 2>then how we fit in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

80
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.903
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

81
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.673
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those things that I really </v>
<v Speaker 3>think are words like people will be </v>

82
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 3>intrigued by the words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think we're ever going to be</v>

83
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:28.834
<v Speaker 3>able to put it in their head what we </v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced because there was one point </v>

84
00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:33.724
<v Speaker 3>in time where Jamison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Colton and I were together in the woods </v>

85
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.973
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just stopped and as we were walking </v>

86
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:43.300
<v Speaker 3>towards his elk that was screaming and </v>
<v Speaker 3>screaming,</v>

87
00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:44.134
<v Speaker 3>alc all around us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you hear these cow elk that are </v>

88
00:03:46.181 --> 00:03:47.014
<v Speaker 3>making it</v>

89
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.930
<v Speaker 2>and screaming is bugling screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We call it screaming.</v>

90
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.150
<v Speaker 2>But there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

91
00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.280
<v Speaker 2>it's part of the mating ritual basically</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a male elk bugling in it.</v>

92
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.040
<v Speaker 2>We call it screaming because it's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

93
00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.260
<v Speaker 2>it's like going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a little higher,</v>

94
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.490
<v Speaker 2>a couple higher notes in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>

95
00:04:08.491 --> 00:04:09.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them are like that,</v>

96
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.510
<v Speaker 2>some of them have a growl to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>starts deep,</v>

97
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.700
<v Speaker 2>it goes high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually comes back deep.</v>

98
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.130
<v Speaker 2>And then the grants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we heard</v>

99
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.070
<v Speaker 3>the one bull that I wound up killing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that sounded like Jurassic Park.</v>

100
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.163
<v Speaker 3>And it was a crazy scene because jamison</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm Colton and I were talked into </v>

101
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.043
<v Speaker 3>Jamieson was the guy was filming at </v>
<v Speaker 3>Colton was the guide and me and were </v>

102
00:04:31.241 --> 00:04:33.410
<v Speaker 3>tucked into this one small area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

103
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.323
<v Speaker 3>these trees that was at the edge of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>creek and we were watching these dose </v>

104
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.560
<v Speaker 3>and we saw three dose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we knew and there's a lesson in this.</v>

105
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:42.400
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dale,</v>

106
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.900
<v Speaker 3>I said those cows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

107
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:45.980
<v Speaker 3>wrong terminology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

108
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.833
<v Speaker 3>there's a lesson in this for regular </v>
<v Speaker 3>people for life and this is the lesson </v>

109
00:04:50.141 --> 00:04:54.790
<v Speaker 3>in life because we saw these cows and we</v>
<v Speaker 3>snuck in and we were like,</v>

110
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.653
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's got to be a bull here because </v>

111
00:04:57.011 --> 00:04:58.630
<v Speaker 3>there's like three cows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we saw three</v>

112
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.700
<v Speaker 2>one more time a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no cows unattended.</v>

113
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.540
<v Speaker 2>So there was 30 cows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cows cap file and in.</v>

114
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.130
<v Speaker 2>And we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where is this bowl?</v>

115
00:05:07.131 --> 00:05:09.140
<v Speaker 2>Like where is he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all of a sudden out of the creek,</v>

116
00:05:09.141 --> 00:05:14.141
<v Speaker 2>bottom steam coming out of his mouth are</v>
<v Speaker 2>away 60,</v>

117
00:05:15.711 --> 00:05:16.830
<v Speaker 2>70 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some point,</v>

118
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.460
<v Speaker 2>like through the trees and couldn't end </v>
<v Speaker 2>up screwed.</v>

119
00:05:19.461 --> 00:05:21.740
<v Speaker 2>The bugling is deafening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels like at that,</v>

120
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.360
<v Speaker 2>at that distance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So close.</v>

121
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.760
<v Speaker 2>So loud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was just letting everybody know.</v>

122
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't fuck up.</v>

123
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

124
00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like a grand entrance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this gives you chills,</v>

125
00:05:32.241 --> 00:05:33.920
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

126
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.210
<v Speaker 2>But this is the less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

127
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.920
<v Speaker 3>There was one cow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had 30 cows.</v>

128
00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:39.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one cows.</v>

129
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.460
<v Speaker 3>Like I didn't want to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm tired of being number three.</v>

130
00:05:42.461 --> 00:05:43.294
<v Speaker 3>There's always wanted this and she takes</v>
<v Speaker 3>off and he could not just be satisfied </v>

131
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.950
<v Speaker 3>with this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thirty nine.</v>

132
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.720
<v Speaker 3>I think he had more than 30.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so hard to count.</v>

133
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:53.583
<v Speaker 3>There were everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he could not be satisfied with the </v>

134
00:05:56.531 --> 00:05:57.440
<v Speaker 3>cows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He left.</v>

135
00:05:57.441 --> 00:05:57.771
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

136
00:05:57.771 --> 00:05:58.030
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

137
00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.280
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

138
00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.821
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where are you going?</v>

139
00:05:58.821 --> 00:05:59.654
<v Speaker 3>Baby?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And went chasing after her and when he </v>

140
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:02.624
<v Speaker 3>went chasing after her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these other cows that were left behind </v>

141
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:09.560
<v Speaker 3>started going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They make this noise like they want some</v>

142
00:06:09.561 --> 00:06:11.600
<v Speaker 3>Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when that was happening,</v>

143
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.540
<v Speaker 3>this other bull behind us was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

144
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.080
<v Speaker 3>felt that bill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the man for you girls.</v>

145
00:06:18.081 --> 00:06:18.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what?</v>

146
00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.510
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm right here.</v>

147
00:06:20.511 --> 00:06:22.880
<v Speaker 3>So he started screaming and then the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other bolts started screaming.</v>

148
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.953
<v Speaker 3>So he decided it's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he takes all of his cows and he </v>

149
00:06:26.901 --> 00:06:28.430
<v Speaker 3>moves them over the top of the hill.</v>

150
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.440
<v Speaker 1>When he moved him over the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hill,</v>

151
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.380
<v Speaker 1>we went after him and when we went after</v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

152
00:06:33.381 --> 00:06:36.590
<v Speaker 1>he turned around because he thought we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were that other bull.</v>

153
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.300
<v Speaker 1>He heard you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He heard us walking.</v>

154
00:06:38.301 --> 00:06:39.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's the thinking here.</v>

155
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:40.543
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he just thought it was the bull</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming hurt their sticks breaking in </v>

156
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.860
<v Speaker 1>footfalls and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

157
00:06:46.861 --> 00:06:47.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's how he gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

158
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:48.783
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if he just let that girl go get out </v>

159
00:06:51.351 --> 00:06:53.060
<v Speaker 1>of here baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's a lesson.</v>

160
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.370
<v Speaker 1>The lesson is you got to let things go </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>

161
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.233
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a 30 cows and one of them takes </v>

162
00:06:57.981 --> 00:06:59.810
<v Speaker 1>off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you might take an arrow in the chest.</v>

163
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:00.840
<v Speaker 1>You might.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

164
00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let him go,</v>

165
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to jot that down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And actually it's a very strong lesson.</v>

166
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.690
<v Speaker 1>It's a lesson for life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes you can't be greedy.</v>

167
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.840
<v Speaker 1>He got greedy and when we probably got </v>
<v Speaker 1>them anyway,</v>

168
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.030
<v Speaker 1>but he got greedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tough.</v>

169
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things,</v>

170
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.900
<v Speaker 1>they only have one thing on their mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's breeding,</v>

171
00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:19.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there is no,</v>

172
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>29 is good enough,</v>

173
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we're rough numbers,</v>

174
00:07:23.091 --> 00:07:23.924
<v Speaker 1>but let that one go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fighting for everything they </v>

175
00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:26.960
<v Speaker 1>got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

176
00:07:26.961 --> 00:07:27.950
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

177
00:07:27.951 --> 00:07:30.110
<v Speaker 1>we did see bulls fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

178
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

179
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:33.530
<v Speaker 1>we see the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

180
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:36.410
<v Speaker 1>the big herd bulls posturing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

181
00:07:36.411 --> 00:07:41.090
<v Speaker 1>so there bugling they get Kinda swole up</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes if they're uh,</v>

182
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's a subordinate bowl,</v>

183
00:07:43.011 --> 00:07:46.940
<v Speaker 1>they'll kind of walk a little sideways </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say see how big I am.</v>

184
00:07:46.941 --> 00:07:47.774
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is all of this is body language that </v>

185
00:07:49.311 --> 00:07:51.950
<v Speaker 1>goes on with these elk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's what they do.</v>

186
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.120
<v Speaker 1>That's all they care about right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we were cutting the bull open,</v>

187
00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:01.160
<v Speaker 1>he had cuts and holes all over his rib </v>
<v Speaker 1>cage and his ass,</v>

188
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:05.360

<v Speaker 1>and they're big and big solid muscle.</v>

<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

194
00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:20.163
<v Speaker 1>And you know how tough those mountains </v>
<v Speaker 1>were to get around in their everyday </v>

195
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.110
<v Speaker 1>sleeping on dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tough,</v>

197
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean sort of what a crazy existence to</v>

198
00:08:29.211 --> 00:08:32.750
<v Speaker 1>that for one month out of the year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything goes haywire.</v>

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:35.870
<v Speaker 1>Everything's going to f your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you now your enemies.</v>

200
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:36.913
<v Speaker 1>You're ready to fight to the death with </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys who were just hanging out with a </v>

201
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.710
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Summer.</v>

202
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:40.910
<v Speaker 1>All summer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All summer.</v>

203
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:41.803
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You weren't at the lake but you were </v>

204
00:08:42.651 --> 00:08:46.040
<v Speaker 1>hanging out at the lake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you guys are eating grass.</v>

205
00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:47.123
<v Speaker 1>We're just looking out for wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually they don't have walls up </v>

206
00:08:49.071 --> 00:08:49.311
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

207
00:08:49.311 --> 00:08:51.260
<v Speaker 1>they had a wolf came through real </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently.</v>

208
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.940
<v Speaker 1>Rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of bears,</v>

209
00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:53.953
<v Speaker 1>but they don't have a ton of predators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one reason why the elk are </v>

210
00:08:57.031 --> 00:08:59.580
<v Speaker 1>doing so well up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was incredible.</v>

211
00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.040
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen so many elk in one </v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

212
00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:05.730
<v Speaker 1>like you had told me about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you get there and you hear them</v>

213
00:09:05.731 --> 00:09:10.731
<v Speaker 1>all screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we heard 100 different elks screaming in</v>

214
00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:12.340
<v Speaker 1>this one basin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

217
00:09:16.741 --> 00:09:19.020
<v Speaker 1>And I've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elk hunted a lot of different places and</v>

<v Speaker 1>I said one morning,</v>

221
00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.490
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the morning that it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>snowing and we were in on bowls,</v>

<v Speaker 1>this is as good as it gets.</v>

227
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:40.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

228
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:43.080
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't be any better.</v>

229
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.981
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

230
00:09:43.981 --> 00:09:46.410
<v Speaker 1>The terrain was beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The weather was beautiful.</v>

231
00:09:46.411 --> 00:09:51.411
<v Speaker 1>There was one time where we had snuck up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this one bull and he was younger.</v>

232
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.130
<v Speaker 1>He was still a big bull,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was.</v>

233
00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.310
<v Speaker 1>You wanted to shoot every of the ranch </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we were at.</v>

234
00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:00.460
<v Speaker 1>They were really smart in how they </v>
<v Speaker 1>manage the wildlife.</v>

235
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.313
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things they do is you're </v>

236
00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.940
<v Speaker 1>supposed to only kill an animal that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>over eight years old.</v>

237
00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:07.020
<v Speaker 1>Eight years or older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

238
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.240
<v Speaker 1>So that way they've had many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

239
00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:12.480
<v Speaker 1>many years to breed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really like,</v>

240
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.460
<v Speaker 1>they're in the later years of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

241
00:10:14.461 --> 00:10:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Like how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long does an elk live in the wild?</v>

242
00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.700
<v Speaker 1>This it's lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They thought that the bull I killed last</v>

243
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.550
<v Speaker 1>year was 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's rare.</v>

244
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.850
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At a 10 year old bull was old,</v>

245
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.100
<v Speaker 1>so they figured out eight.</v>

246
00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:30.870
<v Speaker 1>Then it starts going downhill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

247
00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:31.763
<v Speaker 1>it's been past its prime that's past its</v>
<v Speaker 1>prime and that's passed this breeding </v>

248
00:10:35.011 --> 00:10:37.140
<v Speaker 1>prime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's when you want to take it out.</v>

249
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:38.123
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colton said that mine was between eight </v>

250
00:10:39.721 --> 00:10:41.490
<v Speaker 1>and a half and nine and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't.</v>

251
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:45.550
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to get specific and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>guess they have to take the jaw and send</v>

252
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.730
<v Speaker 1>it to a biologist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

253
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.930
<v Speaker 1>Teeth were and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

254
00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.990
<v Speaker 1>the estimate was eight and a half to </v>
<v Speaker 1>nine and a half years old.</v>

255
00:10:50.991 --> 00:10:52.470
<v Speaker 1>It's an old bull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an old bull,</v>

256
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.390
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tank this up.</v>

257
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:57.900
<v Speaker 1>So that property,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about a quarter million acres,</v>

258
00:10:57.901 --> 00:10:58.734
<v Speaker 1>250,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>acres and they figured there's almost </v>

259
00:11:00.541 --> 00:11:02.130
<v Speaker 1>3000 elk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

260
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:05.730
<v Speaker 1>and that's actually a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than optimum,</v>

261
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.090
<v Speaker 1>a carrying capacity for that amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>property,</v>

262
00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.640
<v Speaker 1>that many l.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they'd like to get that number down a</v>

263
00:11:11.641 --> 00:11:13.680
<v Speaker 1>little bit and just increase the habitat</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

264
00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:15.810
<v Speaker 1>and the elk herd health.</v>

265
00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:18.060
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did they ever think about capturing some</v>

266
00:11:18.061 --> 00:11:19.740
<v Speaker 1>of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know the Rocky Mountain Elk Federation</v>

267
00:11:19.741 --> 00:11:23.250
<v Speaker 1>does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a rocky mountain elk foundation?</v>

268
00:11:23.251 --> 00:11:24.084
<v Speaker 1>What does foundation they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they capture them and then they'll </v>

269
00:11:26.431 --> 00:11:27.264
<v Speaker 1>release them to places like Kentucky and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've sort of reestablished like a </v>

270
00:11:30.361 --> 00:11:32.960
<v Speaker 1>real herd there now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for people,</v>

271
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:33.823
<v Speaker 1>for people that don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at one point in time elk were </v>

272
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.073
<v Speaker 1>essentially all over the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then Europeans came and then market </v>

273
00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:44.930
<v Speaker 1>hunting came and of course we had rifles</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not we,</v>

274
00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.220
<v Speaker 1>we didn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're people,</v>

275
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:50.340
<v Speaker 1>people that are like us out of hippo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

276
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:54.190
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the market hunters essentially almost</v>

277
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:58.390
<v Speaker 3>wiped out the elk and at the turn of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>century there are very few elg,</v>

278
00:11:58.391 --> 00:11:59.224
<v Speaker 3>very few deer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they had established some </v>

279
00:12:01.751 --> 00:12:06.751
<v Speaker 3>protocols and some wildlife conservation</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas in place in order to try to revive</v>

280
00:12:07.511 --> 00:12:08.344
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've done an amazing job since then </v>

281
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:12.880
<v Speaker 3>and now kind of foundations like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rocky mountain elk foundation.</v>

282
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:17.550
<v Speaker 3>What they've done is move elk into areas</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they had been extricated.</v>

283
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.850
<v Speaker 3>So they were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had been driven out of the area,</v>

284
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.310
<v Speaker 3>essentially extinct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>extinct in this one particular region.</v>

285
00:12:24.311 --> 00:12:26.830
<v Speaker 3>And now they have healthy populations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're hunting.</v>

286
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they got enough to where they can</v>

287
00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:30.550
<v Speaker 3>manage them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pennsylvania has a lot of elk now.</v>

288
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:31.810
<v Speaker 3>Big Bulls there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

289
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:33.280
<v Speaker 3>I've seen them on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

290
00:12:33.281 --> 00:12:34.260
<v Speaker 3>on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of.</v>

291
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:35.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

292
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.980
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>

293
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:37.733
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we talk about this every time about </v>

294
00:12:38.541 --> 00:12:41.720
<v Speaker 4>hunters and conservation and the rocky </v>
<v Speaker 4>mountain elk foundation,</v>

295
00:12:41.721 --> 00:12:42.554
<v Speaker 4>but those are the groups that have </v>
<v Speaker 4>fought to protect elk and elk habitat </v>

296
00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:49.280
<v Speaker 4>and that's why they're doing so well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But so I think,</v>

297
00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.280
<v Speaker 4>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's a gratuitous crotch shot.</v>

298
00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:53.960
<v Speaker 4>Let me see that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

299
00:12:53.961 --> 00:12:54.794
<v Speaker 4>that's a rocky mountain elk foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Steps back a little bit so people could </v>

300
00:12:59.421 --> 00:13:01.550
<v Speaker 4>see the glory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is your belt buckle.</v>

301
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.010
<v Speaker 4>That is my belt buckle.</v>

302
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that they've done an amazing job.</v>

303
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:09.423
<v Speaker 3>And then obviously there's companies </v>
<v Speaker 3>that have other foundations that have </v>

304
00:13:11.971 --> 00:13:15.570
<v Speaker 3>done an amazing job for waterfowl and </v>
<v Speaker 3>protecting wetlands.</v>

305
00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:17.493
<v Speaker 3>And then for white tails,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's more white tail deer in </v>

306
00:13:20.341 --> 00:13:22.230
<v Speaker 3>America today than the war when Columbus</v>
<v Speaker 3>came,</v>

307
00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:25.060
<v Speaker 4>that's what most people hunt is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is white tail too,</v>

308
00:13:25.061 --> 00:13:30.061
<v Speaker 4>because they're in eastern southern us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You now were elk are mostly out west,</v>

309
00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:32.950
<v Speaker 4>but they are moving back east again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

310
00:13:32.951 --> 00:13:33.784
<v Speaker 4>most,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most hunters are white tail hunters and </v>

311
00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:35.700
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>

312
00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.600
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that animal's doing amazing.</v>

313
00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:39.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean so amazing.</v>

314
00:13:39.251 --> 00:13:42.400
<v Speaker 3>So that they actually have to hire </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to kill them in some places where</v>

315
00:13:42.401 --> 00:13:46.210
<v Speaker 3>they get too close to urban environments</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they have a ton of car accidents.</v>

316
00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.000
<v Speaker 4>There are some states,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and God,</v>

317
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:48.863
<v Speaker 4>I wish I could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know every state and in the bag </v>

318
00:13:51.031 --> 00:13:51.900
<v Speaker 4>limits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

319
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking Alabama or somewhere down </v>
<v Speaker 4>in there where he can kill a deer a day,</v>

320
00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:59.490
<v Speaker 4>as many as you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no predators.</v>

321
00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:03.120
<v Speaker 4>There's no winter so that these animals </v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't dying on their own.</v>

322
00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:08.370
<v Speaker 4>So I mean we just don't have unlimited </v>
<v Speaker 4>habitat because humans take up space.</v>

323
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.680
<v Speaker 4>So down there at the back and limit is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>deer a day.</v>

324
00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:12.930
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I don't know if it's Alabama,</v>

325
00:14:12.931 --> 00:14:14.190
<v Speaker 4>so don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't quote me on that,</v>

326
00:14:14.191 --> 00:14:15.480
<v Speaker 4>but that's one of those states.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

327
00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:16.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

328
00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.153
<v Speaker 3>I think they have something like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>similar in some parts of Pennsylvania </v>

329
00:14:20.011 --> 00:14:23.280
<v Speaker 3>and New Jersey where they're in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>suburban areas.</v>

330
00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.290
<v Speaker 3>I was watching a television show about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

331
00:14:25.291 --> 00:14:29.520
<v Speaker 3>I think it was one of those reality </v>
<v Speaker 3>shows where they hired people to come in</v>

332
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:32.600
<v Speaker 3>to hunt in suburban neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

333
00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:33.643
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

334
00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:35.550
<v Speaker 4>I've seen something about that too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's not back.</v>

335
00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

336
00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.180
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw an episode of a show the other day</v>

337
00:14:40.181 --> 00:14:42.450
<v Speaker 3>with t bone was doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>T boned.</v>

338
00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:43.720
<v Speaker 3>Turner was shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

339
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.600
<v Speaker 3>I love Tivo and he's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

340
00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:46.453
<v Speaker 3>He's shooting deer in this backyard in </v>
<v Speaker 3>between an above ground swimming pool </v>

341
00:14:50.891 --> 00:14:52.490
<v Speaker 3>and swing set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He shot a deer.</v>

342
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a swing movie.</v>

343
00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.530
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because here's a good shot.</v>

344
00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

345
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.983
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

346
00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:00.281
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Time at.</v>

347
00:15:00.281 --> 00:15:04.750
<v Speaker 2>That'd be kind of fun to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Million car accidents happen every year.</v>

348
00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.210
<v Speaker 2>Just in North America with deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

349
00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:10.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure at 150 people die every year in</v>
<v Speaker 2>car accidents.</v>

350
00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:13.090
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't there a guy that died in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood?</v>

351
00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:14.933
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a deer went through a windshield of a </v>

<v Speaker 2>van or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a right in Eugene.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Didn't like hit the car in front of it,</v>

354
00:15:23.501 --> 00:15:25.630
<v Speaker 2>hit it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it flew into his.</v>

355
00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:27.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't know now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember the.</v>

356
00:15:27.641 --> 00:15:29.360
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's what you told me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

357
00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.300
<v Speaker 2>but it happens a lot.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

359
00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:33.293
<v Speaker 2>that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always that balance of a animal </v>

360
00:15:35.981 --> 00:15:39.610
<v Speaker 2>numbers and habitat and where we live </v>
<v Speaker 2>and making it all work.</v>

361
00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:40.683
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's where people get super </v>

362
00:15:41.361 --> 00:15:43.480
<v Speaker 2>emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People get very emotional about animals,</v>

363
00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:44.350
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

366
00:15:49.121 --> 00:15:50.000
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

367
00:15:50.001 --> 00:15:51.880
<v Speaker 2>He didn't even do that guy didn't die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently.</v>

368
00:15:51.881 --> 00:15:53.940
<v Speaker 2>He just got hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

369
00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:57.850
<v Speaker 2>That is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That looks like a mule deer.</v>

370
00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.140
<v Speaker 2>It's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big deer.</v>

371
00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:00.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come flying through your windshield.</v>

372
00:16:00.761 --> 00:16:02.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People get sued</v>

373
00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:04.810
<v Speaker 3>promotional about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is one of those subjects wherever,</v>

374
00:16:04.811 --> 00:16:05.644
<v Speaker 3>whenever we're talking about hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's one way that we normally </v>

375
00:16:09.431 --> 00:16:10.264
<v Speaker 3>talk about it when it's just like you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I or maybe some other hunters when </v>

376
00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:14.014
<v Speaker 3>we talk about how great it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much we love and how great the meat </v>

377
00:16:16.421 --> 00:16:17.254
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's a way that you talk </v>

378
00:16:18.641 --> 00:16:22.600
<v Speaker 3>about it in public where you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of temper that knowing that there's</v>

379
00:16:22.601 --> 00:16:23.434
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of people that are listening </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are going to get very emotional </v>

380
00:16:26.261 --> 00:16:29.830
<v Speaker 3>that are maybe anti hunters and some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them where it gets really weird.</v>

381
00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:31.353
<v Speaker 3>Also eat meat.</v>

382
00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

383
00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:34.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

384
00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:35.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a sucker.</v>

385
00:16:35.641 --> 00:16:38.220
<v Speaker 2>I read the comments on social media and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

386
00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:39.630
<v Speaker 2>you tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't read them,</v>

387
00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.310
<v Speaker 2>but I think you do too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

388
00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:42.573
<v Speaker 2>and there's just some people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I saw one today and I think </v>

389
00:16:46.051 --> 00:16:50.910
<v Speaker 2>you mentioned that I was going to be on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody said something like Joe for his</v>

390
00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:52.440
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember it.</v>

391
00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.140
<v Speaker 2>Intelligent or in tune or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are,</v>

392
00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:57.590
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe you hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

393
00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.433
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like check that dude's </v>

394
00:17:00.541 --> 00:17:01.970
<v Speaker 2>instagram for a cheeseburger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

395
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:05.070
<v Speaker 2>I check to see if he's got a cat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's feeding murdered animals too.</v>

396
00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:08.960
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you are in tune with actually</v>

397
00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:13.960
<v Speaker 2>how the world and nature in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in how we live and what we need it,</v>

398
00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:17.040
<v Speaker 2>the more in tune you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more accepting you are of hunting.</v>

399
00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:18.940
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the more you,</v>

400
00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:23.960
<v Speaker 2>you slide it because it's how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's how it's how we survive.</v>

401
00:17:24.781 --> 00:17:25.830
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

402
00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:29.610
<v Speaker 2>life eats life and it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems weird for people to think that,</v>

403
00:17:29.611 --> 00:17:30.050
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

404
00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:34.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm evolved past that and I'm smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more intelligent and urine neanderthal.</v>

405
00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.120
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's opposite really</v>

406
00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:39.580
<v Speaker 3>well what they're trying to do and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand it and I appreciate it.</v>

407
00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.473
<v Speaker 3>What they're trying to do is move past </v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that we have to be cruel and </v>

408
00:17:47.531 --> 00:17:48.364
<v Speaker 3>that we have to kill animals and that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to live off the suffering of other </v>

409
00:17:52.411 --> 00:17:55.830
<v Speaker 3>living creatures in our survive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is like the Vegan idea,</v>

410
00:17:55.831 --> 00:17:58.830
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what they want to do is live off only</v>

411
00:17:58.831 --> 00:17:59.664
<v Speaker 3>plants</v>

412
00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:01.293
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not participate at all in any sort </v>

413
00:18:04.301 --> 00:18:06.520
<v Speaker 2>of slaughter of animals or any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cruelty.</v>

414
00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:10.450
<v Speaker 2>And in theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a great idea.</v>

415
00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:13.150
<v Speaker 2>It's a great idea because nobody wants </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be cruel,</v>

416
00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.370
<v Speaker 2>vicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like to be her.</v>

417
00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:17.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My goal isn't to be cruel.</v>

418
00:18:17.471 --> 00:18:19.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't like seeing animals suffer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

419
00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.460
<v Speaker 2>That's the worst thing in my life is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see an animal suffer,</v>

420
00:18:22.461 --> 00:18:23.294
<v Speaker 2>which sounds very contradictory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coming from a guy who killed a lot of </v>

421
00:18:25.391 --> 00:18:26.920
<v Speaker 2>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hundred percent true.</v>

422
00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:28.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't enjoy it.</v>

423
00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.000
<v Speaker 2>If the animal suffers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel bad.</v>

424
00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.190
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if it's okay,</v>

425
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:33.083
<v Speaker 3>clean kill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's better than anything that animal's </v>

426
00:18:37.471 --> 00:18:39.070
<v Speaker 3>going to get in the wild,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the wild,</v>

427
00:18:39.071 --> 00:18:42.900
<v Speaker 3>that animal's going to die either by </v>
<v Speaker 3>freezing to death or being torn apart by</v>

428
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:43.823
<v Speaker 2>predators because it's old or it's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get injured and it's going to get </v>

429
00:18:45.841 --> 00:18:46.980
<v Speaker 2>torn apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Antler,</v>

430
00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:47.843
<v Speaker 2>I found a dead bull last year that took </v>
<v Speaker 2>an hour in the neck from fighting and </v>

431
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.750
<v Speaker 2>who knows how long it took to bleed out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

432
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:57.030
<v Speaker 2>maybe it broke its neck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it was paralyzed and it laid there</v>

433
00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:01.750
<v Speaker 2>and it took days to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a hunter and what I do,</v>

434
00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.920
<v Speaker 2>the term I like to use is being </v>
<v Speaker 2>merciful.</v>

435
00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:10.160
<v Speaker 2>I want to be ethical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quick and merciful when I kill an animal</v>

436
00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:13.980
<v Speaker 2>because that's a 100 percent the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposite of how nature works.</v>

437
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is one thing that you have</v>

438
00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:17.210
<v Speaker 3>said to me in private when we've talked </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>

439
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:20.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were saying that what you trained for</v>

440
00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:21.913
<v Speaker 3>and what you strive for is so that in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that moment you can make the most </v>

441
00:19:25.551 --> 00:19:26.384
<v Speaker 3>precise shot and killed that animal as </v>
<v Speaker 3>quickly and as ethically and as </v>

442
00:19:29.871 --> 00:19:31.470
<v Speaker 3>efficiently as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>

443
00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.920
<v Speaker 3>that sounds that's on your mind every </v>
<v Speaker 3>time you release an arrow</v>

444
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:35.880
<v Speaker 2>every time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

445
00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.790
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I just think people.</v>

446
00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:41.640
<v Speaker 2>I know it's hard to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

447
00:19:41.641 --> 00:19:42.474
<v Speaker 2>If you haven't hunted and you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 2>been in the mountains and you haven't </v>

448
00:19:44.701 --> 00:19:48.030
<v Speaker 2>seen how cruel nature can actually be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

449
00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.070
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to comprehend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

450
00:19:50.071 --> 00:19:50.840
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

451
00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.110
<v Speaker 3>and it's also the reason why human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings are today,</v>

452
00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:56.930
<v Speaker 3>are here today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason why we survived is because of</v>

453
00:19:56.931 --> 00:19:57.764
<v Speaker 3>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it mean that you can't be a </v>

454
00:19:59.331 --> 00:20:00.890
<v Speaker 3>vegetarian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't go vegan or.</v>

455
00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:01.520
<v Speaker 3>No?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't.</v>

456
00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.353
<v Speaker 3>You can do whatever you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the reason why human beings have </v>

457
00:20:05.541 --> 00:20:08.960
<v Speaker 3>made it to the top of the food chain is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we consumed animals.</v>

458
00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:10.123
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the primary reasons that </v>
<v Speaker 3>biologists believe that our brains </v>

459
00:20:13.701 --> 00:20:17.330
<v Speaker 3>evolved past that have lower primates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We figured out fire,</v>

460
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:18.403
<v Speaker 3>we figured out how to cook meat and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>nutrients from that cookie meet along </v>

461
00:20:21.351 --> 00:20:22.184
<v Speaker 3>with the complex problem solving issues </v>
<v Speaker 3>that come up and hunting and one of the </v>

462
00:20:26.691 --> 00:20:27.524
<v Speaker 3>reasons why we evolve because to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>smarter and more clever than these </v>

463
00:20:30.771 --> 00:20:33.370
<v Speaker 3>animals that are faster than you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>smell better than you here,</v>

464
00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:34.730
<v Speaker 3>better than you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>better than you,</v>

465
00:20:34.731 --> 00:20:35.630
<v Speaker 3>stronger than you.</v>

466
00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:37.880
<v Speaker 3>They have more endurance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Knew these elk,</v>

467
00:20:37.881 --> 00:20:39.950
<v Speaker 3>run up that mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's a joke.</v>

468
00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:41.173
<v Speaker 3>I was huffing and puffing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've been running a lot since we </v>

469
00:20:44.361 --> 00:20:45.170
<v Speaker 3>did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

470
00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:46.003
<v Speaker 3>your keep hammering five k last year and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I realized what a pussy and then the </v>

471
00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:52.043
<v Speaker 3>times that we've hunted together too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've just been really out of breath and </v>

472
00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:55.920
<v Speaker 3>even though I work out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do another things,</v>

473
00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:58.990
<v Speaker 3>I realized I have to run hills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's no way around it.</v>

474
00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:02.230
<v Speaker 3>So it helped me a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was very nice to see.</v>

475
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:06.580
<v Speaker 3>It was very nice to see a big difference</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my endurance now where I can keep up.</v>

476
00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:10.450
<v Speaker 3>Whereas before it was like a huge </v>
<v Speaker 3>struggle because every day we were doing</v>

477
00:21:10.451 --> 00:21:11.830
<v Speaker 3>10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12 miles,</v>

478
00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:14.950
<v Speaker 3>but these health go up there like </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

479
00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:16.063
<v Speaker 3>It's nothing so for a human at one point</v>
<v Speaker 3>in our evolutionary past to figure out </v>

480
00:21:21.461 --> 00:21:23.830
<v Speaker 3>how to beat these things at their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>game,</v>

481
00:21:23.831 --> 00:21:28.600
<v Speaker 3>trick them and get meat from them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>survive and then develop strategies,</v>

482
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:29.463
<v Speaker 3>strategies for that and then teach other</v>
<v Speaker 3>people in their community these </v>

483
00:21:31.571 --> 00:21:32.404
<v Speaker 3>strategies and this evolved and this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason why you and I are talking </v>

484
00:21:35.861 --> 00:21:36.694
<v Speaker 3>today on microphones that are powered by</v>
<v Speaker 3>electricity that in this room that's </v>

485
00:21:39.571 --> 00:21:40.404
<v Speaker 3>shelter in this city,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this complex series of buildings that </v>

486
00:21:44.141 --> 00:21:47.920
<v Speaker 3>we've built a lot to protect us from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>environment and from other animals.</v>

487
00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:48.731
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

488
00:21:48.731 --> 00:21:48.930
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

489
00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:49.763
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been quite a journey and the part </v>

490
00:21:52.521 --> 00:21:53.630
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

491
00:21:53.631 --> 00:21:54.650
<v Speaker 2>we have evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

492
00:21:54.651 --> 00:21:55.484
<v Speaker 2>we've got better and we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why we're different than an elk </v>

493
00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:00.540
<v Speaker 2>and other animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

494
00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:05.510
<v Speaker 2>And we take advantage of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>superiority and we use it to kill them,</v>

495
00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:07.700
<v Speaker 2>to eat them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hold them at home.</v>

496
00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:10.430
<v Speaker 2>But I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

497
00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:11.400
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

498
00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:13.580
<v Speaker 2>if it was about the killing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just killing,</v>

499
00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:16.460
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't bow hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bow Hunting is very hard.</v>

500
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:17.463
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would rifle hunt if I just want to go </v>

501
00:22:18.661 --> 00:22:19.970
<v Speaker 2>out there and kill something that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>

502
00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.790
<v Speaker 2>that's usually the most efficient way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get it.</v>

503
00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.040
<v Speaker 2>Kills you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe 10 times easier,</v>

504
00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But with a bow I just know how difficult</v>

505
00:22:27.921 --> 00:22:28.550
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

506
00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:30.770
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you talked about the improvements you've</v>

507
00:22:30.771 --> 00:22:32.960
<v Speaker 2>made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd been bow hunting now for four years</v>

508
00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:34.740
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted,</v>

509
00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.430
<v Speaker 2>I do want to touch on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

510
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:42.070
<v Speaker 2>it's been awesome to see the dedication </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to the craft of bowhunting.</v>

511
00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:44.630
<v Speaker 2>It is not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

512
00:22:44.631 --> 00:22:47.450
<v Speaker 2>I know people who don't hunt see it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

513
00:22:47.451 --> 00:22:48.284
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just enjoy killing animals out </v>

514
00:22:49.521 --> 00:22:50.271
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just said if I,</v>

515
00:22:50.271 --> 00:22:51.260
<v Speaker 2>if I just want to kill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd,</v>

516
00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:52.970
<v Speaker 2>I'd use a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

517
00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:53.893
<v Speaker 2>it is about the challenge about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience and it's not easy and the </v>

518
00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:01.640
<v Speaker 2>improvements you've made in four years </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's basically through obsession.</v>

519
00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:03.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be great at anything,</v>

520
00:23:03.531 --> 00:23:05.930
<v Speaker 2>you need to be slightly obsessed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you have been,</v>

521
00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:11.270
<v Speaker 2>but that learning curve for hunting is </v>
<v Speaker 2>so steep is sometimes people,</v>

522
00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:12.253
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of how we've talked and you </v>

523
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:15.410
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

524
00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:17.360
<v Speaker 2>the stories we've shared on social </v>
<v Speaker 2>media,</v>

525
00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:19.310
<v Speaker 2>it looks intriguing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks,</v>

526
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:21.110
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

527
00:23:21.111 --> 00:23:22.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's powerful.</v>

528
00:23:22.461 --> 00:23:24.110
<v Speaker 2>So people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want a piece of that.</v>

529
00:23:24.111 --> 00:23:27.740
<v Speaker 2>They want to know what that feels like </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be ingrained in that world.</v>

530
00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.290
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get messages,</v>

531
00:23:30.291 --> 00:23:31.124
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to get started in bowhunting and </v>

532
00:23:31.971 --> 00:23:33.740
<v Speaker 2>part of me is going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

533
00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:37.010
<v Speaker 2>I want you to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's a long journey.</v>

534
00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.350
<v Speaker 2>It is hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's almost too much.</v>

535
00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:40.383
<v Speaker 2>It's not too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to discourage anybody but </v>

536
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:44.210
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's tough.</v>

537
00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:45.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just good enough.</v>

538
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.710
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing this for almost 30 years</v>

539
00:23:48.711 --> 00:23:49.730
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 89.</v>

540
00:23:49.731 --> 00:23:52.220
<v Speaker 1>I killed my first bull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elk is a spike bull.</v>

541
00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:53.863
<v Speaker 1>And so since 1989,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is 29 years of bowhunting and I </v>

542
00:23:57.141 --> 00:23:57.974
<v Speaker 1>go into this season just like I go into </v>
<v Speaker 1>every season and I wonder is this going </v>

543
00:24:01.801 --> 00:24:03.180
<v Speaker 1>to be the season where I don't get any </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid?</v>

544
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:05.570
<v Speaker 1>I have no success because it could </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

545
00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:06.973
<v Speaker 1>It's that hard because I've killed </v>
<v Speaker 1>before and had success for all these </v>

546
00:24:10.551 --> 00:24:12.590
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't mean anything right now.</v>

547
00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:16.460
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't mean anything to an animal that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was pursuing it in Utah,</v>

548
00:24:16.461 --> 00:24:18.590
<v Speaker 1>a big bull,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that big bulk of care.</v>

549
00:24:18.591 --> 00:24:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Less about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

550
00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:20.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

551
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:23.660
<v Speaker 1>he's had a lot of success over the years</v>
<v Speaker 1>means nothing,</v>

552
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:24.643
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>

553
00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:27.380
<v Speaker 1>so I always wonder is this gonna be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>year where I can't get it done?</v>

554
00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:28.483
<v Speaker 1>And it completely changes your </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to your food because all </v>

555
00:24:31.431 --> 00:24:34.910
<v Speaker 1>your meat that you're getting in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>house is coming from your success.</v>

556
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:35.833
<v Speaker 1>Bowhunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

557
00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:36.683
<v Speaker 1>So when you are entering into a season </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're wondering whether or not </v>

558
00:24:40.191 --> 00:24:41.024
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are literally worrying whether or </v>

559
00:24:43.311 --> 00:24:46.580
<v Speaker 1>not you're going to be able to provide </v>
<v Speaker 1>for your family the way you have been.</v>

560
00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:48.920
<v Speaker 1>And it's not like we're starving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

561
00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the way you've chosen to meet</v>

562
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:52.910
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this ethical,</v>

563
00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:54.710
<v Speaker 1>humane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wild way.</v>

564
00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:57.590
<v Speaker 1>One of my family goes to the freezer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>opens it.</v>

565
00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.950
<v Speaker 1>There's always elk meat in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always.</v>

566
00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.650
<v Speaker 1>That's what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I make sure we have,</v>

567
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:04.543
<v Speaker 1>my family has meat to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when they go to the freezer and open </v>

568
00:25:07.731 --> 00:25:10.520
<v Speaker 1>it and there's no elk meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not good.</v>

569
00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:11.421
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

570
00:25:11.421 --> 00:25:13.940
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to starve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what we're used to.</v>

571
00:25:13.941 --> 00:25:16.220
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's I've provided like that.</v>

572
00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:19.250
<v Speaker 1>My family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends and family have called,</v>

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't want him to face the prospect of</v>
<v Speaker 1>not having that.</v>

580
00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

581
00:25:32.301 --> 00:25:35.460
<v Speaker 1>I give away a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm constantly giving it to Brian Cowen.</v>

582
00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:36.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian.</v>

583
00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:37.453
<v Speaker 1>And to get back on the horse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hasn't had any success haunting in a </v>

584
00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:41.800
<v Speaker 1>couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he mooches off me.</v>

585
00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:43.490
<v Speaker 1>Did he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's killed then.</v>

586
00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a few deer.</v>

587
00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

588
00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:47.750
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's never shot a bow before.</v>

589
00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:49.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's rifle hunted.</v>

590
00:25:49.611 --> 00:25:52.040
<v Speaker 1>I figured that's why he was so ripped </v>
<v Speaker 1>his from all that,</v>

591
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.690
<v Speaker 1>that a lean meat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lean protein because he's,</v>

592
00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.120
<v Speaker 1>he is a beautiful man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's beautiful.</v>

593
00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:00.201
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

594
00:26:00.201 --> 00:26:01.034
<v Speaker 1>He wants to get into bow hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's another one of those things </v>

595
00:26:02.751 --> 00:26:03.620
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

596
00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:05.570
<v Speaker 1>you say you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do you really,</v>

597
00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:06.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you do,</v>

598
00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:10.850
<v Speaker 1>it's going to take it all in and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't go halfway.</v>

599
00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:12.243
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

600
00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:15.350
<v Speaker 1>and there's another thing that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>love to say,</v>

601
00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.410
<v Speaker 1>you know that meat is terrible for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to get cancer and heart</v>

602
00:26:18.411 --> 00:26:20.930
<v Speaker 1>attacks and diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People keep repeating that.</v>

603
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Stop saying it because it's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're wrong.</v>

604
00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:25.573
<v Speaker 1>I know you like to say that because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds good and it sounds like a really </v>

605
00:26:29.451 --> 00:26:32.810
<v Speaker 1>good argument for people that eat meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely untrue.</v>

606
00:26:32.811 --> 00:26:35.150
<v Speaker 1>And if you go back and look at the real </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies,</v>

607
00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:36.373
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that they've shown is </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a connection between cancer and </v>

608
00:26:39.621 --> 00:26:40.454
<v Speaker 1>processed food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a connection between </v>

609
00:26:42.441 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 1>preservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nitrites</v>

610
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.490
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of the things that we use to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make processed meat.</v>

611
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:48.533
<v Speaker 3>So if you're talking about things like </v>
<v Speaker 3>hot dogs and processed meats and you </v>

612
00:26:52.591 --> 00:26:54.560
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of like beef sticks,</v>

613
00:26:54.561 --> 00:26:56.520
<v Speaker 3>you might get at the gas station.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

614
00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:59.220
<v Speaker 3>eat enough of those and your body's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to revolt.</v>

615
00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:00.203
<v Speaker 3>It's not good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but wild game meat is some of the most </v>

616
00:27:03.721 --> 00:27:04.554
<v Speaker 3>nutritious and healthy things that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can put in your body and that's just a </v>

617
00:27:08.191 --> 00:27:12.420
<v Speaker 3>fact and so people that keep putting </v>
<v Speaker 3>these comments on campaigns,</v>

618
00:27:12.421 --> 00:27:15.180
<v Speaker 3>his instagram page and occasionally on </v>
<v Speaker 3>mine and all these different,</v>

619
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:16.733
<v Speaker 3>they always want to say this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kay k nutrients are good luck with your </v>

620
00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:19.503
<v Speaker 3>heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not true in every study that has </v>

621
00:27:22.021 --> 00:27:22.854
<v Speaker 3>shown that it is true is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've all been debunked by actual </v>

622
00:27:26.131 --> 00:27:26.964
<v Speaker 3>science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the real people that are </v>

623
00:27:27.991 --> 00:27:32.070
<v Speaker 3>putting together these documentaries </v>
<v Speaker 3>that show that meat causes diabetes,</v>

624
00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.560
<v Speaker 3>they are fools and it's not true.</v>

625
00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:38.820
<v Speaker 3>It's been widely debunked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they are as proselytizing vegans,</v>

626
00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:39.913
<v Speaker 3>they're vegans who want everyone to </v>
<v Speaker 3>become vegan so they are distorting </v>

627
00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:44.493
<v Speaker 3>truth and making documentaries that have</v>
<v Speaker 3>no basis in actual reality and science </v>

628
00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:51.540
<v Speaker 3>and if you just google like it was the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most recent one.</v>

629
00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:54.750
<v Speaker 3>Those guys did the hell yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the health.</v>

630
00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:59.490
<v Speaker 3>Google what the health debunked and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a ton of scientists that have no</v>

631
00:27:59.491 --> 00:28:02.880
<v Speaker 3>stake in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not like from the meat industry.</v>

632
00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:07.410
<v Speaker 3>They're just people that have seen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the doctors have reviewed it.</v>

633
00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:08.573
<v Speaker 3>There's people that have seen the actual</v>
<v Speaker 3>facts and seeing this documentary and </v>

634
00:28:11.671 --> 00:28:12.810
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is nonsense.</v>

635
00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:15.090
<v Speaker 3>And so people regurgitate that stuff all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

636
00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:17.330
<v Speaker 3>I just want to tell people like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

637
00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:20.610
<v Speaker 3>just do some research,</v>
<v Speaker 3>read some of the actual studies.</v>

638
00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:22.590
<v Speaker 3>Here's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what's bad for you.</v>

639
00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:25.160
<v Speaker 3>A sedentary lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sedentary lifestyles,</v>

640
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.880
<v Speaker 3>terrible for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting in your office chair,</v>

641
00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:30.330
<v Speaker 3>one sitting in a cubicle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eating too much bad for you.</v>

642
00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:33.300
<v Speaker 3>High carbohydrate diets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad for getting too fat,</v>

643
00:28:33.301 --> 00:28:35.040
<v Speaker 3>bad for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drinking a lot of alcohol,</v>

644
00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:36.990
<v Speaker 3>bad for drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sugary sodas,</v>

645
00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.033
<v Speaker 3>bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All those things are way worse for you </v>

646
00:28:39.871 --> 00:28:41.760
<v Speaker 3>than an elk stake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Way Worse.</v>

647
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:42.833
<v Speaker 3>So if you're eating any of those things </v>
<v Speaker 3>or doing any of those things and you </v>

648
00:28:44.941 --> 00:28:46.080
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good luck with your hood,</v>

649
00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:49.140
<v Speaker 3>took fuck off because you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're talking about.</v>

650
00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:51.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>

651
00:28:51.401 --> 00:28:52.610
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

652
00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:55.150
<v Speaker 2>since we're central talking about one </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that I get,</v>

653
00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:00.370
<v Speaker 2>I think we have to be careful on is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>slamming,</v>

654
00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.600
<v Speaker 2>I guess the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

655
00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:06.160
<v Speaker 2>the beef industry because I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not trying to do that.</v>

656
00:29:06.161 --> 00:29:07.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people always say,</v>

657
00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:08.783
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's cattle ranchers out there that </v>

658
00:29:09.551 --> 00:29:10.930
<v Speaker 2>work hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it right.</v>

659
00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:11.793
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is factory farming which people I </v>

660
00:29:14.071 --> 00:29:14.904
<v Speaker 2>feel like almost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been guilty of it maybe thrown </v>

661
00:29:17.771 --> 00:29:18.604
<v Speaker 2>around factory farming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like a Vegan will throw around </v>

662
00:29:20.571 --> 00:29:24.160
<v Speaker 2>and good luck with that heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're most,</v>

663
00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:27.970
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of ranches that do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>right that have the cattle out there,</v>

664
00:29:27.971 --> 00:29:28.804
<v Speaker 2>free ranging and the only time that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're there in a small enclosure is </v>

665
00:29:31.901 --> 00:29:33.430
<v Speaker 2>when they are killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Slaughter.</v>

666
00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:34.211
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brought to slaughter.</v>

667
00:29:34.211 --> 00:29:35.510
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

668
00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:36.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I buy,</v>

669
00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:40.650
<v Speaker 2>I buy steaks still occasionally from my </v>
<v Speaker 2>buddy at e three.</v>

670
00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:43.180
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's plenty of places that have,</v>

671
00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:47.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you're gonna look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>ethical beef production.</v>

672
00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.360
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of places that do it.</v>

673
00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.273
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the same thing can be said with </v>

674
00:29:51.361 --> 00:29:54.450
<v Speaker 3>chicken and same thing you'd say with </v>
<v Speaker 3>poultry,</v>

675
00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:55.643
<v Speaker 3>Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of free range and it's </v>

676
00:29:57.241 --> 00:29:58.074
<v Speaker 3>more of an emphasis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's one of the reasons why </v>

677
00:29:59.581 --> 00:30:01.950
<v Speaker 3>people become more and more interested </v>
<v Speaker 3>in hunting today.</v>

678
00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:02.993
<v Speaker 3>They're doing well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people are more concerned with the </v>

679
00:30:07.231 --> 00:30:10.230
<v Speaker 3>ethics behind how their food is raised.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

680
00:30:10.231 --> 00:30:11.064
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of farm to table </v>
<v Speaker 3>restaurants that are opening up which </v>

681
00:30:13.501 --> 00:30:16.080
<v Speaker 3>are really amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can go and you can,</v>

682
00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:16.943
<v Speaker 3>you know I'm and there's a place near me</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you get these eggs and they're dark </v>

683
00:30:20.611 --> 00:30:21.444
<v Speaker 3>yolks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a dark orange yolk at this </v>

684
00:30:23.101 --> 00:30:26.760
<v Speaker 3>restaurant and they have like grass fed </v>
<v Speaker 3>beef that tastes healthy.</v>

685
00:30:26.761 --> 00:30:30.390
<v Speaker 3>It tastes really good and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff we're supposed to be eating.</v>

686
00:30:30.391 --> 00:30:35.391
<v Speaker 3>We've gotten into this crazy situation </v>
<v Speaker 3>as human beings where we're getting food</v>

687
00:30:36.391 --> 00:30:37.224
<v Speaker 3>that is in a lot of ways tasteless </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's been engineered to last </v>

688
00:30:42.241 --> 00:30:43.074
<v Speaker 3>forever on a shelf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've gotten this meat that's gotten </v>

689
00:30:45.361 --> 00:30:46.194
<v Speaker 3>super fat because they're pumping them </v>
<v Speaker 3>up with antibiotics and feeding them </v>

690
00:30:49.111 --> 00:30:49.944
<v Speaker 3>grain until they just become these fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unhealthy things that are in no way </v>

691
00:30:54.541 --> 00:30:56.580
<v Speaker 3>resemble a wild creature.</v>

692
00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:57.613
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had a steak last night at the </v>

693
00:30:58.401 --> 00:30:59.910
<v Speaker 2>airport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

694
00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:04.190
<v Speaker 2>I've tastewise is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could barely taste it.</v>

695
00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:05.123
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was nothing.</v>

696
00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:06.390
<v Speaker 3>Not much to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

697
00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.370
<v Speaker 3>and I think there was also probably the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way it was cooked,</v>

698
00:31:08.371 --> 00:31:12.150
<v Speaker 3>but what was really weird is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference in the connection with that.</v>

699
00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:13.163
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you sit down and you cook an </v>

700
00:31:15.241 --> 00:31:16.074
<v Speaker 3>elk steak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you remember where you were when you </v>

701
00:31:19.471 --> 00:31:20.304
<v Speaker 3>shot that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you remember how hard it was to get to </v>

702
00:31:22.711 --> 00:31:24.840
<v Speaker 3>that elk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You remember the stock,</v>

703
00:31:24.841 --> 00:31:29.520
<v Speaker 3>you remember maybe made me several blown</v>
<v Speaker 3>stocks where the wind shifted on you and</v>

704
00:31:29.521 --> 00:31:34.521
<v Speaker 3>the elk spooked and took off and how </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult it is and the intense success.</v>

705
00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.270
<v Speaker 3>And that's another thing that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't like.</v>

706
00:31:36.271 --> 00:31:40.410
<v Speaker 3>The idea of the happiness that comes </v>
<v Speaker 3>with success when you kill something,</v>

707
00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:41.580
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

708
00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:42.850
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

709
00:31:42.851 --> 00:31:43.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's.</v>

710
00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:45.523
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's an achievement and it has </v>

711
00:31:46.981 --> 00:31:47.561
<v Speaker 2>not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

712
00:31:47.561 --> 00:31:49.120
<v Speaker 2>we're selling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we murdered something.</v>

713
00:31:49.121 --> 00:31:50.290
<v Speaker 2>So we're celebrating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

714
00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:52.630
<v Speaker 2>it's so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talked about the difficulty.</v>

715
00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have achieved something of,</v>

716
00:31:55.910 --> 00:32:00.370
<v Speaker 2>of great difficulty with that animal's </v>
<v Speaker 2>dead.</v>

717
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:03.670
<v Speaker 2>And then your skinning it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're cutting the meat off.</v>

718
00:32:03.671 --> 00:32:04.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

719
00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:07.630
<v Speaker 2>I took out the tenderloins of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

720
00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:09.300
<v Speaker 2>of the bull I killed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

721
00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:14.050
<v Speaker 2>and smelled it and made sure the meat is</v>
<v Speaker 2>always just making sure that,</v>

722
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:16.780
<v Speaker 2>that is the fruit of the labor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right there is that meat,</v>

723
00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:17.643
<v Speaker 2>so you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're holding a big slab of steak and </v>

724
00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:24.100
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you remember everything,</v>

725
00:32:24.101 --> 00:32:27.100
<v Speaker 2>but most of what I'm thinking of there </v>
<v Speaker 2>is how clean it is,</v>

726
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:29.260
<v Speaker 2>how pure it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does it smell good,</v>

727
00:32:29.261 --> 00:32:31.990
<v Speaker 2>smells perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's just kind of the process.</v>

728
00:32:31.991 --> 00:32:34.240
<v Speaker 2>It goes in the meat bag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes on my back,</v>

729
00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:37.660
<v Speaker 2>it comes off the mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes in the cooler,</v>

730
00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:40.270
<v Speaker 2>it goes to the process or it gets cut </v>
<v Speaker 2>and frozen</v>

731
00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:43.970
<v Speaker 1>wrapped and then then I cook it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of,</v>

732
00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:45.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of steps.</v>

733
00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:47.660
<v Speaker 1>We go to the airport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we say,</v>

734
00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:48.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

735
00:32:48.831 --> 00:32:50.990
<v Speaker 1>can I get the Sirloin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's it.</v>

736
00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:52.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

737
00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:54.200
<v Speaker 1>And that's how most people do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

738
00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:57.340
<v Speaker 1>And that's a weird place that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten into as human beings.</v>

739
00:32:57.530 --> 00:32:58.363
<v Speaker 1>Hunters are judged negatively for having</v>
<v Speaker 1>just that whole emotional thing and all </v>

740
00:33:02.481 --> 00:33:04.130
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meaning and the feeling.</v>

741
00:33:04.131 --> 00:33:06.770
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the connection to it in,</v>

742
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:08.203
<v Speaker 1>and we're judged negatively for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The but the person who sits down and </v>

743
00:33:10.821 --> 00:33:12.170
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take the sirloin.</v>

744
00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:13.243
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

745
00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:14.750
<v Speaker 1>good to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

746
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:16.400
<v Speaker 1>it should be opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should,</v>

747
00:33:16.401 --> 00:33:19.970
<v Speaker 1>but you know what it is too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the building is faceless,</v>

748
00:33:19.971 --> 00:33:20.631
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

749
00:33:20.631 --> 00:33:23.630
<v Speaker 1>The restaurant is faceless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The supermarket is faceless.</v>

750
00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:27.290
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea who did the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>killing of the cow.</v>

751
00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:28.933
<v Speaker 1>When you go to the woods and you come </v>
<v Speaker 1>out with an elk steak and you kill it </v>

752
00:33:33.651 --> 00:33:36.710
<v Speaker 1>and you're wearing a rocky mountain elk </v>
<v Speaker 1>foundation belt buckle.</v>

753
00:33:36.711 --> 00:33:38.990
<v Speaker 1>And your campaigns like people can look </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>

754
00:33:38.991 --> 00:33:41.530
<v Speaker 1>Well there I found one right there like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

755
00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:45.050
<v Speaker 1>And your connection to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

756
00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:46.453
<v Speaker 1>if someone was outside protesting you </v>
<v Speaker 1>like they found out we're doing this </v>

757
00:33:48.711 --> 00:33:50.780
<v Speaker 1>podcast near like you son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

758
00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:51.440
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

759
00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:52.273
<v Speaker 1>we're the ones who put up the petition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to get you banned from under </v>

760
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:55.760
<v Speaker 1>armor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a terrible person.</v>

761
00:33:55.761 --> 00:33:57.740
<v Speaker 1>You're a trophy hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're out there killing animals.</v>

762
00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:59.053
<v Speaker 1>All around them is dead animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every gas station is filled with beef </v>

763
00:34:02.841 --> 00:34:03.674
<v Speaker 1>sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every restaurant is filled with dead </v>

764
00:34:04.611 --> 00:34:05.444
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every supermarket is filled with dead </v>

765
00:34:07.311 --> 00:34:09.560
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this area where we're at,</v>

766
00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:10.693
<v Speaker 1>there are 100 places that you can walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>to inside of three minutes that have </v>

767
00:34:14.241 --> 00:34:15.170
<v Speaker 1>dead animals in them.</v>

768
00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.033
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're.</v>

769
00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:18.110
<v Speaker 1>They'd be protesting here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>testing here.</v>

770
00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:19.003
<v Speaker 1>You because you're the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And meanwhile that's what's so back ass </v>

771
00:34:22.851 --> 00:34:25.340
<v Speaker 1>words about it and it's because we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing the right way.</v>

772
00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:27.650
<v Speaker 1>You're doing not saying you have to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it that way,</v>

773
00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.890
<v Speaker 1>but if you wanted to have the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is weird word,</v>

774
00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:35.070
<v Speaker 1>spiritual connection to your food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

775
00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:35.953
<v Speaker 1>there's no this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing else I've ever </v>

776
00:34:38.211 --> 00:34:40.490
<v Speaker 1>experienced that's even remotely close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

777
00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:42.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

778
00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:46.580
<v Speaker 1>and there's I guess to some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people are getting it,</v>

779
00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:47.773
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some people that would be </v>

780
00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:49.093
<v Speaker 1>protest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear it wouldn't matter what </v>

781
00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:51.283
<v Speaker 1>justification you had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are never going to see it and </v>

782
00:34:53.541 --> 00:34:57.260
<v Speaker 1>that's fine because we're all different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all have different passions,</v>

783
00:34:57.261 --> 00:34:59.630
<v Speaker 1>so that group of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

784
00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:02.990
<v Speaker 1>But there's a people in the middle that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have,</v>

785
00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:04.273
<v Speaker 1>they have heard and they have thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it and they have realized that </v>

786
00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:10.190
<v Speaker 1>does make it actually make sense.</v>

787
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:11.023
<v Speaker 1>And those are the people that want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what it'd be like to be a provider </v>

788
00:35:13.491 --> 00:35:16.340
<v Speaker 1>for themselves to go to go into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountains and,</v>

789
00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:19.640
<v Speaker 1>and become loaded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loaded out with a,</v>

790
00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:21.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pack full of meat.</v>

791
00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.600
<v Speaker 1>And so those are the people I guess </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking to.</v>

792
00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:25.790
<v Speaker 1>We're never going to get the extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People know.</v>

793
00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:26.683
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's always going to be the case </v>

794
00:35:27.441 --> 00:35:28.274
<v Speaker 1>with all arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always going to be radical </v>

795
00:35:29.541 --> 00:35:31.340
<v Speaker 1>people on all sides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

796
00:35:31.341 --> 00:35:32.640
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

797
00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:38.160
<v Speaker 1>our job as human beings communicating to</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings is</v>

798
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:43.160
<v Speaker 3>to try to relay our own experiences as </v>
<v Speaker 3>clear and as honest as possible.</v>

799
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.260
<v Speaker 3>And that's why I was trying to look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>it from the other point of view.</v>

800
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:51.360
<v Speaker 3>I always try to look at it from what </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that I think are good people that</v>

801
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:52.223
<v Speaker 3>become vegans because they're good </v>
<v Speaker 3>people because they want to have no </v>

802
00:35:54.811 --> 00:35:58.860
<v Speaker 3>cruelty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think they just have a perspective</v>

803
00:35:58.861 --> 00:36:03.861
<v Speaker 3>that I don't share and that perspective </v>
<v Speaker 3>is I've actually been involved in.</v>

804
00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:08.430
<v Speaker 3>I've gone through the ritual of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting,</v>

805
00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:12.660
<v Speaker 3>we've gone through the trials and </v>
<v Speaker 3>tribulations of hiking many,</v>

806
00:36:12.661 --> 00:36:16.500
<v Speaker 3>many miles and trying to find these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things and trying to figure out the wind</v>

807
00:36:16.501 --> 00:36:16.870
<v Speaker 3>and.</v>

808
00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:18.880
<v Speaker 2>And it hasn't all been success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

809
00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:20.770
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot of failure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of failure.</v>

810
00:36:20.771 --> 00:36:21.604
<v Speaker 3>It's more successful lately than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's just because I've worked </v>

811
00:36:23.621 --> 00:36:26.170
<v Speaker 3>harder than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it be more and more dedication,</v>

812
00:36:26.171 --> 00:36:28.960
<v Speaker 3>more time being obsessed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More time practicing.</v>

813
00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:30.540
<v Speaker 3>I practice every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

814
00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:31.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm shooting every day.</v>

815
00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:33.560
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

816
00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:36.770
<v Speaker 2>people see the success,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they see the pictures.</v>

817
00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:39.710
<v Speaker 2>If it's something they want to hate me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they hate.</v>

818
00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:44.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm sitting there with the dead elk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But hunting is such a rollercoaster.</v>

819
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:47.570
<v Speaker 2>It's like everything is magnified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The success is magnified because it's so</v>

820
00:36:47.571 --> 00:36:48.404
<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The failure is magnified because it </v>

821
00:36:49.671 --> 00:36:52.370
<v Speaker 2>hurts so bad because you've worked so </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>

822
00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

823
00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:55.250
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it took me.</v>

824
00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:56.240
<v Speaker 2>I started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

825
00:36:56.241 --> 00:36:57.074
<v Speaker 2>in 1989,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it took me to 1996 to kill my first six </v>

826
00:37:00.591 --> 00:37:04.490
<v Speaker 2>point bull elk in the wilderness and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it would have been,</v>

827
00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:06.560
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't even look at it on this last</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

828
00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:07.580
<v Speaker 2>It would have been like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

829
00:37:07.581 --> 00:37:09.050
<v Speaker 2>there's a little bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

830
00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:10.123
<v Speaker 2>but when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I got that six point bullel I felt </v>

831
00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.240
<v Speaker 2>so proud I'd finally achieved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

832
00:37:17.241 --> 00:37:18.074
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a bull on this buckle right here </v>

833
00:37:19.341 --> 00:37:22.310
<v Speaker 2>is a six point and I thought I finally </v>
<v Speaker 2>did it,</v>

834
00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:24.043
<v Speaker 2>but in between there had been so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>disappointments and devastations and in </v>

835
00:37:28.011 --> 00:37:28.844
<v Speaker 2>the wilderness.</v>

836
00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:33.260
<v Speaker 2>I remember one time I had been in there </v>
<v Speaker 2>by myself.</v>

837
00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:34.123
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking like day eight as in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>dry creek bed and here comes these cows </v>

838
00:37:38.661 --> 00:37:39.494
<v Speaker 2>come across,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here comes this big bowl and I don't </v>

839
00:37:41.751 --> 00:37:44.030
<v Speaker 2>know how big he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was pretty big for their three,</v>

840
00:37:44.031 --> 00:37:46.460
<v Speaker 2>2130,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a scoring number.</v>

841
00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:48.213
<v Speaker 2>It would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is calculating the length of the </v>

842
00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:52.550
<v Speaker 2>antlers of the antlers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

843
00:37:52.551 --> 00:37:56.480
<v Speaker 2>So it would have been still slightly </v>
<v Speaker 2>smaller than the Bulls we just killed.</v>

844
00:37:57.350 --> 00:38:02.350
<v Speaker 2>And he came across there and I'm on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>knees and I shoot and uh,</v>

845
00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.800
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hit,</v>

846
00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:06.530
<v Speaker 2>if you hit him in the shoulder back </v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

847
00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:07.633
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bose weren't as efficient as they </v>

848
00:38:09.651 --> 00:38:10.484
<v Speaker 2>are now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you hit him in the shoulder </v>

849
00:38:11.601 --> 00:38:13.820
<v Speaker 2>blade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it went in about,</v>

850
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:15.463
<v Speaker 2>I would say an inch inch and a half </v>
<v Speaker 2>Arrow hit his shoulder blades stopped </v>

851
00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:19.813
<v Speaker 2>and basically fell out and he went </v>
<v Speaker 2>running off and I went up and picked up </v>

852
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:26.990
<v Speaker 2>my Arrow and there's blood on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>broadhead and to them,</v>

853
00:38:26.991 --> 00:38:29.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that is they might have a</v>

854
00:38:29.541 --> 00:38:30.800
<v Speaker 2>sore shoulder for a little while.</v>

855
00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:34.190
<v Speaker 2>They take antlers and the guts and neck </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all the time.</v>

856
00:38:34.191 --> 00:38:36.850
<v Speaker 2>So they heal up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're amazing.</v>

857
00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:40.210
<v Speaker 2>So that was nothing centrally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing more than a flesh wound.</v>

858
00:38:40.211 --> 00:38:42.130
<v Speaker 2>But I remember sitting there looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>my Arrow,</v>

859
00:38:42.131 --> 00:38:42.964
<v Speaker 2>looking at little bit of blood on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>broadhead and I mean eyes welling up </v>

860
00:38:48.281 --> 00:38:51.790
<v Speaker 2>with tears because eight days just </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

861
00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:52.653
<v Speaker 2>But working all year towards that moment</v>
<v Speaker 2>and having that opportunity at 43 yards </v>

862
00:38:57.820 --> 00:38:58.653
<v Speaker 2>and being inches off because inches </v>
<v Speaker 2>further to the right back would have </v>

863
00:39:01.601 --> 00:39:03.310
<v Speaker 2>been doubled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Long Dead Bull.</v>

864
00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:04.153
<v Speaker 2>Biggest bull ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the hard work paid off to being </v>

865
00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:07.803
<v Speaker 2>devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people see the success some 20 years </v>

866
00:39:12.551 --> 00:39:16.240
<v Speaker 2>later or whatever it's been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't to be,</v>

867
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:17.103
<v Speaker 2>to feel as disappointed as I was to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to wonder if all the work was worth it </v>

868
00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.520
<v Speaker 2>to hurt that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't see that.</v>

869
00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.820
<v Speaker 2>But that's why hunting is so powerful.</v>

870
00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:31.840
<v Speaker 2>That's why hunting has changed my life </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's so difficult.</v>

871
00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:35.350
<v Speaker 2>And because there's those ups and downs </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

872
00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:36.963
<v Speaker 2>we try,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do a better job of sharing the </v>

873
00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:40.780
<v Speaker 2>complete journey now than back in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

874
00:39:40.781 --> 00:39:41.520
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

875
00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:42.280
<v Speaker 2>just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

876
00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.600
<v Speaker 2>killed his bull.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

877
00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:45.790
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd go to the archery pro shop,</v>

878
00:39:45.791 --> 00:39:48.040
<v Speaker 2>you put your picture up of the bullies </v>
<v Speaker 2>you killed.</v>

879
00:39:48.041 --> 00:39:50.890
<v Speaker 2>And that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we're a little more in tune.</v>

880
00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:53.020
<v Speaker 2>I see all sorts of people on social </v>
<v Speaker 2>media now.</v>

881
00:39:53.021 --> 00:39:53.854
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

882
00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:56.460
<v Speaker 2>they showed the picture of their bowl </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they get down,</v>

883
00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:57.790
<v Speaker 2>you read the caption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about,</v>

884
00:39:57.791 --> 00:39:59.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>providing for their family and,</v>

885
00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:00.563
<v Speaker 2>and pure protein in their freezer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we were doing a better job of </v>

886
00:40:04.361 --> 00:40:05.500
<v Speaker 2>explaining it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But still,</v>

887
00:40:05.501 --> 00:40:06.334
<v Speaker 2>until you've been there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really hard to grasp what it all </v>

888
00:40:09.341 --> 00:40:10.630
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

889
00:40:10.631 --> 00:40:10.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't</v>

890
00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:13.920
<v Speaker 3>to anybody's going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's possible.</v>

891
00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:17.550
<v Speaker 3>It's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's something more,</v>

892
00:40:17.551 --> 00:40:18.750
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a discipline,</v>

893
00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:20.063
<v Speaker 3>but it's something more like sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 3>people call bowhunting a sport and I </v>

894
00:40:23.491 --> 00:40:24.720
<v Speaker 3>always kind of cringe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

895
00:40:24.721 --> 00:40:27.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't like that either because I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a word for it now.</v>

896
00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's a comparative </v>
<v Speaker 3>word.</v>

897
00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:31.823
<v Speaker 3>I think it's bow hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it is what it is because I </v>

898
00:40:34.131 --> 00:40:34.760
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

899
00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:38.750
<v Speaker 2>It's a lifestyle is what I say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be immersed in the lifestyle</v>

900
00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:42.560
<v Speaker 2>to really understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A sport makes it seem like,</v>

901
00:40:42.561 --> 00:40:45.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping score well,</v>

902
00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:47.350
<v Speaker 3>to me it's a lot like Jujitsu in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>way too.</v>

903
00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:50.440
<v Speaker 3>Where if you talk to people who train in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu a lot,</v>

904
00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:51.483
<v Speaker 3>they understand how difficult it is and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they understand the struggle and they </v>

905
00:40:54.881 --> 00:40:58.410
<v Speaker 3>understand that in that struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like all struggles every day.</v>

906
00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:01.510
<v Speaker 3>I think people need struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's very important.</v>

907
00:41:01.511 --> 00:41:02.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you.</v>

908
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.000
<v Speaker 3>You get better not just at the Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 3>or not just at the bowhunting.</v>

909
00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:09.243
<v Speaker 3>You get better at being a person and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel better today after this trip in </v>

910
00:41:14.111 --> 00:41:17.680
<v Speaker 3>Utah than I felt before I left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not that I felt bad before I left.</v>

911
00:41:17.681 --> 00:41:19.570
<v Speaker 3>I felt great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I feel energized.</v>

912
00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:23.130
<v Speaker 3>I feel energized because the experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fear,</v>

913
00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:25.030
<v Speaker 3>analgesia energized because of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>struggle.</v>

914
00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:28.900
<v Speaker 3>I feel energized because of how </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult it was to hike those mountains</v>

915
00:41:28.901 --> 00:41:31.220
<v Speaker 3>up and down and chasing those elk around</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

916
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:34.000
<v Speaker 3>and having things blow out and getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>back to the,</v>

917
00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:37.880
<v Speaker 3>to the lodge and being so tired that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>could just barely eat your food.</v>

918
00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:42.590
<v Speaker 3>And then I'm passing out almost like out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of as I'm done eating and then I crashed</v>

919
00:41:42.591 --> 00:41:45.020
<v Speaker 3>and the alarm goes off at 5:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the morning and then you're out there</v>

920
00:41:45.021 --> 00:41:45.854
<v Speaker 3>in the dark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doing it again and then have success so </v>

921
00:41:49.051 --> 00:41:49.884
<v Speaker 3>to to understand that you can push </v>
<v Speaker 3>through things and you can get better </v>

922
00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:55.213
<v Speaker 3>and you can practice things and you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>get better and that applies to </v>

923
00:41:58.041 --> 00:41:59.450
<v Speaker 3>everything in life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>

924
00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:04.370
<v Speaker 3>It's a discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's discipline like almost no other</v>

925
00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:08.900
<v Speaker 3>because it's not just a discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a discipline that also sustains you</v>

926
00:42:08.901 --> 00:42:13.730
<v Speaker 3>and your family and it's a discipline </v>
<v Speaker 3>that involves like real critical moments</v>

927
00:42:13.731 --> 00:42:14.564
<v Speaker 3>of life and death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when I was drawn back on that bowl </v>

928
00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:19.153
<v Speaker 3>and I'm looking at this bull through a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very small window where I could shoot </v>

929
00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:25.460
<v Speaker 3>between these two trees 32 yards away </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Colton,</v>

930
00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:26.323
<v Speaker 3>who was the guy paused,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this bully made a cow sound like being </v>

931
00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:31.670
<v Speaker 3>like right where that bull needed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>stop.</v>

932
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:33.320
<v Speaker 3>Like the bulb walked in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

933
00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:34.413
<v Speaker 3>he called it stopped and that critical </v>
<v Speaker 3>moment where you have to make a perfect </v>

934
00:42:38.031 --> 00:42:42.400
<v Speaker 3>shot in a split second and intensity </v>
<v Speaker 3>intensity roxane.</v>

935
00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:44.110
<v Speaker 3>It's like nothing else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

936
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:45.223
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's end to do it and to do it </v>

937
00:42:47.631 --> 00:42:48.464
<v Speaker 3>successfully and then have that elk </v>
<v Speaker 3>dying seconds and have that elk wander </v>

938
00:42:51.081 --> 00:42:53.900
<v Speaker 3>off 20 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like seeing it bleed out of both sides,</v>

939
00:42:53.901 --> 00:42:56.240
<v Speaker 3>knowing this is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is probably.</v>

940
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:57.530
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not probably,</v>

941
00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:59.900
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless he falls off a cliff.</v>

942
00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:01.093
<v Speaker 3>This is the cleanest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fastest death this thing is ever going </v>

943
00:43:03.671 --> 00:43:04.504
<v Speaker 3>to have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

944
00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:05.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

945
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:08.470
<v Speaker 4>and I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm going to eat it tonight.</v>

946
00:43:10.210 --> 00:43:11.043
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

947
00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:13.720
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so much reverence in the moment.</v>

948
00:43:13.721 --> 00:43:14.554
<v Speaker 4>I what I like and we talked about this </v>
<v Speaker 4>film and in and capturing it and </v>

949
00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:20.950
<v Speaker 4>hopefully with the message we can convey</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a film,</v>

950
00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:26.640
<v Speaker 4>but you did a great job after that shot </v>
<v Speaker 4>of really just a,</v>

951
00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:32.490
<v Speaker 4>I guess verbalizing how you felt in and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and kind of everything you just said,</v>

952
00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:36.430
<v Speaker 4>but more authentic because it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was.</v>

953
00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:41.720
<v Speaker 4>You were there in the bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was laying there dead and uh,</v>

954
00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:44.770
<v Speaker 4>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

955
00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:46.983
<v Speaker 4>It's intense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish there's a way people could get </v>

956
00:43:48.491 --> 00:43:49.324
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

957
00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:50.183
<v Speaker 3>I think these kind of conversations help</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit and I know for people </v>

958
00:43:53.371 --> 00:43:54.750
<v Speaker 3>listening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some people that go,</v>

959
00:43:54.751 --> 00:43:55.920
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys are redundant.</v>

<v Speaker 4>but why baseball hats?</v>

<v Speaker 4>They don't like baseball.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

979
00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:51.580
<v Speaker 3>except when you're just being funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

00:44:51.581 --> 00:44:54.040
<v Speaker 3>that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I do for a living.</v>

981
00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.320
<v Speaker 3>Like when people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's pretty negative.</v>

982
00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:58.090
<v Speaker 3>Well it's not really because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean it,</v>

983
00:44:58.210 --> 00:44:59.043
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my friends will say some of the </v>

984

986
00:45:06.071 --> 00:45:08.530
<v Speaker 3>but that's what makes it funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't mean that at all.</v>

987
00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:11.400
<v Speaker 3>If there was no truth to it at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be no humor</v>

988
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:16.170
<v Speaker 4>to it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Had I wanted to touch on this a,</v>

989
00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:18.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we talk about the struggle and the,</v>

990
00:45:18.771 --> 00:45:19.890
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hardship.</v>

991
00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:22.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm Adam Green tree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our friend,</v>

992
00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:23.973
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

993
00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:25.433
<v Speaker 4>he had a in a lot of people here have </v>
<v Speaker 4>followed along on his journey and what </v>

994
00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:30.550
<v Speaker 4>would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

995
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:35.160
<v Speaker 4>In his journey will be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he hunted three different states over</v>

996
00:45:35.161 --> 00:45:38.310
<v Speaker 4>the course of about three weeks and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

997
00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:42.250
<v Speaker 4>by himself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by himself solo in the back country with</v>

998
00:45:42.251 --> 00:45:43.370
<v Speaker 4>a tiny little tent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

999
00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:46.500
<v Speaker 4>He hunted Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then he went to Montana,</v>

1000
00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:48.600
<v Speaker 4>then he ended up killing a bull on </v>
<v Speaker 4>Idaho.</v>

1001
00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:52.530
<v Speaker 4>If you look on the surface of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you didn't understand,</v>

1002
00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:53.790
<v Speaker 4>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1003
00:45:53.791 --> 00:45:56.040
<v Speaker 4>he undid three states and he killed a </v>
<v Speaker 4>five point bull.</v>

1004
00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:57.660
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>

1005
00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:59.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a lot of effort for that.</v>

1006
00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:04.740
<v Speaker 4>But to him and to people who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who embrace struggle,</v>

1007
00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:07.800
<v Speaker 4>it's not just the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a five point bull died.</v>

1008
00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:11.910
<v Speaker 4>That was a journey and that was the end </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the journey and they were success and</v>

1009
00:46:11.911 --> 00:46:13.140
<v Speaker 4>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1010
00:46:13.141 --> 00:46:15.690
<v Speaker 4>there was tons of failure along the way.</v>

1011
00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:17.110
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best part about it was it.</v>

1012
00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:19.000
<v Speaker 3>He documented the entire thing on </v>
<v Speaker 3>instagram.</v>

1013
00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:20.133
<v Speaker 3>He did it on his instagram story and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>let people know I put up a bunch of </v>

1014
00:46:22.241 --> 00:46:23.074
<v Speaker 3>posts about it and one of the posts that</v>
<v Speaker 3>sent his followers skyrocketing was him </v>

1015
00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:28.593
<v Speaker 3>holding a pistol and then in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>distance he took a photo of this crazy </v>

1016
00:46:31.301 --> 00:46:36.301
<v Speaker 3>bastard in the moment there's a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>giant grizzly standing on its hind legs.</v>

1017
00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:39.640
<v Speaker 3>Looking at him from it looked like no </v>
<v Speaker 3>more than 50,</v>

1018
00:46:39.641 --> 00:46:40.474
<v Speaker 3>60 yards away and he's holding up a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pistol that I said that it's one of the </v>

1019
00:46:43.751 --> 00:46:45.070
<v Speaker 3>most,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you could see it there.</v>

1020
00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:45.963
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That looks like it may be at the most </v>

1021
00:46:47.231 --> 00:46:49.510
<v Speaker 3>probably 100 videos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think it stands out.</v>

1022
00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:50.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this video?</v>

1023

1025
00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:00.260
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that gun looks like it's 200 years old.</v>

1026
00:47:02.170 --> 00:47:03.003
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's just out of focus how it's </v>

1027
00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:05.920
<v Speaker 4>got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1029
00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.033
<v Speaker 4>that's a phone video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I mean it's way closer than the </v>

1030
00:47:11.581 --> 00:47:12.414
<v Speaker 4>looks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It keeps standing up to try to figure </v>

1031
00:47:14.051 --> 00:47:16.180
<v Speaker 4>out where he is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what he's doing,</v>

1032
00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:21.100
<v Speaker 4>and in a moment like that</v>

<v Speaker 5>she comes for me one more time.</v>

1035
00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:45.513
<v Speaker 2>I just can't imagine what it'd be like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're welling out there for 20 plus </v>

1036
00:47:48.221 --> 00:47:50.700

<v Speaker 2>A moment like that is,</v>

1037
00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:51.573
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're pretty used to being around </v>

1038
00:47:53.921 --> 00:47:55.150
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1039
00:47:55.151 --> 00:47:58.450
<v Speaker 2>if something happened here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you do whatever you could.</v>

1040
00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:00.620
<v Speaker 2>Jamie would do whatever he could to help</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1041
00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:05.640
<v Speaker 2>if we needed help with in that nobody's </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming your bike 100 percent.</v>

1042
00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:11.500
<v Speaker 2>He's by himself and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those types of experiences,</v>

1043
00:48:11.501 --> 00:48:13.450
<v Speaker 2>where else are you going to get that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's in,</v>

1044
00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:18.480
<v Speaker 2>he's in the mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a bear that the bears just doing</v>

1045
00:48:18.491 --> 00:48:20.260
<v Speaker 2>what barriers do right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1046
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:21.223
<v Speaker 2>but that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's immersed himself into that </v>

1047
00:48:22.451 --> 00:48:25.510
<v Speaker 2>world and that's all part of this whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>process,</v>

1048
00:48:25.511 --> 00:48:28.590
<v Speaker 2>that whole journey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's what intrigued everybody does</v>

1049
00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:31.390
<v Speaker 2>following along is because that's as </v>
<v Speaker 2>real as it gets.</v>

1050
00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:32.283
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1051
00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:35.620
<v Speaker 2>and he surviving and we talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1052
00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:37.360
<v Speaker 2>in our house we got back tired.</v>

1053
00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:41.690
<v Speaker 2>We were able to go to be dry and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else in that intent,</v>

1054
00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:45.160
<v Speaker 2>you're getting in a tent if you were wet</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you got into the tent,</v>

1055
00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.620
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be wet in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1056
00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:48.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's uh,</v>

1057
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:51.160
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's uncomfortable,</v>

1058
00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:52.023
<v Speaker 2>it's uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know that's what I grew up doing </v>

1059
00:48:54.821 --> 00:48:59.821
<v Speaker 2>because I had no other option that has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I could hunt Oregon for $25 on an</v>

1060
00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:00.723
<v Speaker 2>elk tag and hunt public land and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>all I did for decades because I was the </v>

1061
00:49:05.381 --> 00:49:08.260
<v Speaker 2>only option I have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is,</v>

1062
00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:11.770
<v Speaker 2>that is difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like I said,</v>

1063
00:49:11.771 --> 00:49:15.220
<v Speaker 2>you question why you're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people would say no,</v>

1064
00:49:15.221 --> 00:49:17.350
<v Speaker 2>I'd kill like a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I saw five point bowl,</v>

1065
00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:20.350
<v Speaker 2>like what Adam killed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd kill it and be happy.</v>

1066
00:49:20.351 --> 00:49:23.560
<v Speaker 2>And people say you don't need to work </v>
<v Speaker 2>that hard to kill an elk.</v>

1067
00:49:23.730 --> 00:49:24.563
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could kill that bull off off a </v>

1068
00:49:25.661 --> 00:49:30.661
<v Speaker 2>gravel road and a truck camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to me that's not what it was about.</v>

1069
00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:32.643
<v Speaker 2>It was about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole journey in the wilderness and </v>

1070
00:49:35.141 --> 00:49:35.974
<v Speaker 2>surviving and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and navigating and problem solving and </v>

1071
00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:41.253
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it wasn't the biggest bull in the </v>

1072
00:49:41.981 --> 00:49:44.920
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's just one piece of the puzzle.</v>

1073
00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:45.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there isn't.</v>

1074
00:49:45.810 --> 00:49:45.860
<v Speaker 2>There's a</v>

1075
00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:49.160
<v Speaker 3>difference between,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I have done this a few times between</v>

1076
00:49:49.161 --> 00:49:54.161
<v Speaker 3>camping and staying a lodge standard </v>
<v Speaker 3>lodges nicer.</v>

1077
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:55.700
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were,</v>

1078
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:56.583
<v Speaker 3>we were in Utah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We would go back to the lodge and it </v>

1079
00:49:59.031 --> 00:50:00.230
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1080
00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:01.123
<v Speaker 3>you and me and our buddy Ben O'brian was</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and was lots of laughs and we're </v>

1081
00:50:07.101 --> 00:50:07.934
<v Speaker 3>having a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd all eat dinner together and just </v>

1082
00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:11.653
<v Speaker 3>shoot the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're in the woods and you're </v>

1083
00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:16.700
<v Speaker 3>camping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're still in the woods.</v>

1084
00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:19.580
<v Speaker 3>There's no like with the largest </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization,</v>

1085
00:50:19.610 --> 00:50:21.350
<v Speaker 3>there's electricity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's hot water.</v>

1086
00:50:21.351 --> 00:50:23.690
<v Speaker 3>You can take a shower when you're in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>woods,</v>

1087
00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:26.330
<v Speaker 3>you stay in the woods when you camp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wake up,</v>

1088
00:50:26.331 --> 00:50:27.370
<v Speaker 3>you're in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1089
00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:31.760
<v Speaker 3>it's a more immersive experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's the next level,</v>

1090
00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:35.720
<v Speaker 3>which is what Adam did in the woods by </v>
<v Speaker 3>himself for manny,</v>

1091
00:50:35.721 --> 00:50:36.531
<v Speaker 3>manny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>manny,</v>

1092
00:50:36.531 --> 00:50:38.480
<v Speaker 3>manny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>days before he had success.</v>

1093
00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:43.600
<v Speaker 3>And then there's video of him after he </v>
<v Speaker 3>shot that elk 20 whatever days in when,</v>

1094
00:50:47.541 --> 00:50:48.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

1095
00:50:48.531 --> 00:50:50.930
<v Speaker 3>it's finally over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's finally over.</v>

1096
00:50:50.931 --> 00:50:52.970
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy just went on a vision quest,</v>

1097
00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:54.133
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1098
00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:56.090
<v Speaker 2>so much respect for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1099
00:50:56.091 --> 00:50:58.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is so tough.</v>

1100
00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:03.410
<v Speaker 2>And he's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bowhunting means,</v>

1101
00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:07.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you tried to explain to explain what,</v>

1102
00:51:07.450 --> 00:51:08.720
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does one mean to you?</v>

1103
00:51:08.721 --> 00:51:11.150
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't do it with words for </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody like him,</v>

1104
00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:11.980
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1105
00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:13.660
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would lock myself in there.</v>

1106
00:51:13.661 --> 00:51:17.600
<v Speaker 2>It's like bawling defines who I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who he is.</v>

1107
00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:19.340
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1108
00:51:19.341 --> 00:51:20.174
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

1109
00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:23.120
<v Speaker 2>I know I've done seminars before and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've asked people,</v>

1110
00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:26.210
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's a 100 or 200 people there,</v>

1111
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:27.223
<v Speaker 2>how many people stayed out in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the mountains by themself for one </v>

1112
00:51:30.771 --> 00:51:33.290
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her never,</v>

1113
00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:35.840
<v Speaker 2>hardly anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1114
00:51:35.841 --> 00:51:36.674
<v Speaker 2>how many people do you know that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>stayed out in the woods by themselves </v>

1115
00:51:38.570 --> 00:51:39.190
<v Speaker 2>for night?</v>

1116
00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:40.023
<v Speaker 3>I just know a few because I know </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunter's like remy new and green tree </v>

1117
00:51:43.811 --> 00:51:45.000
<v Speaker 3>and a few other folks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1118
00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:45.893
<v Speaker 2>So most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't like to be by themselves and </v>

1119
00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:53.610
<v Speaker 2>they want to feel safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for Adam to do that for three weeks,</v>

1120
00:51:54.210 --> 00:51:56.520
<v Speaker 2>that says something because hardly </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody ever does it.</v>

1121
00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:57.900
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1122
00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:00.750
<v Speaker 2>and so he did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Loved it.</v>

1123
00:52:01.070 --> 00:52:03.330
<v Speaker 2>I think he loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His video said he loved it.</v>

1124
00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:08.250
<v Speaker 2>He didn't always love it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

1125
00:52:08.251 --> 00:52:08.641
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1126
00:52:08.641 --> 00:52:10.350
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't speak for him,</v>

1127
00:52:10.351 --> 00:52:13.080
<v Speaker 2>but I can speak for myself and know that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't always love it.</v>

1128
00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:16.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's times where I,</v>

1129
00:52:16.690 --> 00:52:18.390
<v Speaker 2>I would question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1130
00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.790
<v Speaker 2>what am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this worth it?</v>

1131
00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:22.433
<v Speaker 2>But you'd fight through that and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you come out stronger and be </v>

1132
00:52:27.901 --> 00:52:30.810
<v Speaker 2>ready for the next challenge and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully paid off.</v>

1133
00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:33.810
<v Speaker 3>I think any experience in nature is good</v>
<v Speaker 3>for people.</v>

1134
00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:34.673
<v Speaker 3>I think we spent entirely too much time </v>
<v Speaker 3>and cities entirely too much time </v>

1135
00:52:37.081 --> 00:52:41.040
<v Speaker 3>indoors and buildings and artificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>lighting and all that stuff.</v>

1136
00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:45.150
<v Speaker 3>I think any experience in nature at all </v>
<v Speaker 3>is good for you.</v>

1137
00:52:45.151 --> 00:52:48.360
<v Speaker 3>It's just good to be grounded and </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally grounded,</v>

1138
00:52:48.361 --> 00:52:51.130
<v Speaker 3>like to feel the ground and to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand that this is,</v>

1139
00:52:51.131 --> 00:52:54.540
<v Speaker 3>this is the wild world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the real world because the other</v>

1140
00:52:54.541 --> 00:52:59.040
<v Speaker 3>thing is this out thing that we've sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of concocted as human beings,</v>

1141
00:52:59.370 --> 00:53:00.203
<v Speaker 3>but the more time you spend in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more it reveals itself to you and </v>

1142
00:53:02.941 --> 00:53:06.900
<v Speaker 3>there's a weird empty loneliness to true</v>
<v Speaker 3>wilderness.</v>

1143
00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:07.883
<v Speaker 3>Like when you're at the top of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mountain and you don't have any cell </v>

1144
00:53:09.601 --> 00:53:13.440
<v Speaker 3>signal and you don't see a building </v>
<v Speaker 3>anywhere as far as the eye can see.</v>

1145
00:53:13.441 --> 00:53:14.274
<v Speaker 3>You don't see there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're nowhere near city when we're out </v>

1146
00:53:16.291 --> 00:53:17.124
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you sit up there and you look out </v>

1147
00:53:19.501 --> 00:53:23.790
<v Speaker 3>and you hear a coyote howl and you see </v>
<v Speaker 3>an eagle fly overhead and you know,</v>

1148
00:53:23.791 --> 00:53:25.710
<v Speaker 3>you hear an elk bugle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just.</v>

1149
00:53:25.711 --> 00:53:28.200
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing like it.</v>

1150
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:30.480
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the real wild.</v>

1151
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:31.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't.</v>

1152
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.080
<v Speaker 3>They don't know you're a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't care.</v>

1153
00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:37.200
<v Speaker 3>They care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you get close to them,</v>

1154
00:53:37.201 --> 00:53:38.034
<v Speaker 3>they'll run away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what they're there to do is what </v>

1155
00:53:39.781 --> 00:53:41.280
<v Speaker 3>they've been doing for thousands.</v>

1156
00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:44.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's it set.</v>

1157
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:45.463
<v Speaker 2>It's so different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You talk about how we got to lax last </v>

1158
00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:51.650
<v Speaker 2>night and I'm just walking around going </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know,</v>

1159
00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:53.840
<v Speaker 2>100 percent feel this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm like,</v>

1160
00:53:53.841 --> 00:53:54.890
<v Speaker 2>I told,</v>
<v Speaker 2>told you,</v>

1161
00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:55.733
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate people just there was so many </v>

1162
00:54:00.210 --> 00:54:03.740
<v Speaker 2>because we went from no people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1163
00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:07.730
<v Speaker 2>it's so enriching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1164
00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:10.250
<v Speaker 2>I dunno what I keep saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful.</v>

1165
00:54:10.251 --> 00:54:14.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't know word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is it all the time by Stag stag.</v>

1166
00:54:14.301 --> 00:54:16.340
<v Speaker 2>Powerful Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1167
00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:19.750
<v Speaker 2>but in the mountains it's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

1168
00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:21.800
<v Speaker 2>it's so simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Life is so simple.</v>

1169
00:54:21.801 --> 00:54:22.870
<v Speaker 2>It's like it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't.</v>

1170
00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:24.870
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's super complicated.</v>

1171
00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:29.370
<v Speaker 3>Like to survive out there you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a lot of things work in your favor.</v>

1172
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:30.343
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's simple because either you </v>

1173
00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:32.750
<v Speaker 2>survive or you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1174
00:54:32.751 --> 00:54:37.070
<v Speaker 2>But it's not because it's either you </v>
<v Speaker 2>kill the bull or you don't,</v>

1175
00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:39.620
<v Speaker 2>or you eat berries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>automate a lot of berries.</v>

1176
00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:40.401
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1177
00:54:40.401 --> 00:54:41.310
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a,</v>

1178
00:54:41.350 --> 00:54:42.183
<v Speaker 2>that's where I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1179
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:44.210
<v Speaker 2>I like about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's simple.</v>

1180
00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:47.150
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1181
00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:49.700
<v Speaker 2>there's no different social classes of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1182
00:54:49.701 --> 00:54:50.534
<v Speaker 2>There's no</v>

1183
00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:51.570
<v Speaker 3>very important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1184
00:54:51.650 --> 00:54:52.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1185
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:53.063
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a thing that happens out there </v>

1186
00:54:54.481 --> 00:54:59.481
<v Speaker 3>where you're clearly defined by your </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to perform under pressure.</v>

1187
00:54:59.851 --> 00:55:00.684
<v Speaker 3>Only if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go out there and you're some </v>

1188
00:55:03.930 --> 00:55:06.480
<v Speaker 3>famous rock star or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's some,</v>

1189
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:07.463
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some guy who lives in a giant mansion </v>

1190
00:55:09.331 --> 00:55:11.730
<v Speaker 3>and flies around and private jet and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>own an island,</v>

1191
00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:12.953
<v Speaker 3>but you choke when you're going to shoot</v>
<v Speaker 3>a ball and you shoot it in the Dick and </v>

1192
00:55:17.401 --> 00:55:19.830
<v Speaker 3>everybody knows you're a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a loser.</v>

1193
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:20.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that amazing?</v>

1194
00:55:20.791 --> 00:55:21.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is A,</v>

1195
00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:23.310
<v Speaker 3>there's a leveling.</v>

1196
00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:24.443
<v Speaker 2>There's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the people who get respect </v>

1197
00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:29.620
<v Speaker 2>hunters get re.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you,</v>

1198
00:55:29.621 --> 00:55:31.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1199
00:55:31.630 --> 00:55:32.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can navigate,</v>

1200
00:55:32.981 --> 00:55:35.320
<v Speaker 2>if you can see elk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can,</v>

1201
00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:37.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>read blood.</v>

1202
00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:39.650
<v Speaker 2>If your blood trailing you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1203
00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:43.420
<v Speaker 2>you got woodsmen ship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can unravel a blood trail.</v>

1204
00:55:43.810 --> 00:55:46.600
<v Speaker 2>You can start a fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're here.</v>

1205
00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:47.493
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter about how much money </v>

1206
00:55:48.671 --> 00:55:49.504
<v Speaker 2>you have or who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can't do any of that stuff while </v>

1207
00:55:52.451 --> 00:55:52.850
<v Speaker 2>you're</v>

1208
00:55:52.850 --> 00:55:54.650
<v Speaker 3>your lower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>

1209
00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:55.873
<v Speaker 3>it was incredibly important to be able </v>
<v Speaker 3>to perform during crunch time because I </v>

1210
00:56:00.471 --> 00:56:03.230
<v Speaker 3>wanted the respect of the people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>also do it.</v>

1211
00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:08.680
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to get that was very important </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be able to in that moment and I spent</v>

1212
00:56:10.071 --> 00:56:15.071
<v Speaker 3>so much time thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going over podcasts and all that.</v>

1213
00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:19.850
<v Speaker 3>Joel Turner stuff about target panic and</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the closed loop,</v>

1214
00:56:19.851 --> 00:56:20.684
<v Speaker 3>an open loop mind systems and how your </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain functions pressure and thinking </v>

1215
00:56:24.221 --> 00:56:25.054
<v Speaker 3>about all these different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of thought to this might sound </v>

1216
00:56:27.311 --> 00:56:28.960
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous to somebody who has that </v>
<v Speaker 3>shot.</v>

1217
00:56:28.961 --> 00:56:30.920
<v Speaker 3>A bow that like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1218
00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:32.680
<v Speaker 3>you just pull back and shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1219
00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:33.893
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1220
00:56:34.090 --> 00:56:38.290
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's when you look at a 900 pound forest</v>

1221
00:56:38.291 --> 00:56:43.291
<v Speaker 3>horse was spears grown out of its head </v>
<v Speaker 3>and screaming and there's one shot.</v>

1222
00:56:44.141 --> 00:56:44.974
<v Speaker 3>You have one opportunity and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you only have one tag and if you wound </v>

1223
00:56:48.551 --> 00:56:49.900
<v Speaker 3>an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's over.</v>

1224
00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:50.711
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you.</v>

1225
00:56:50.711 --> 00:56:53.290
<v Speaker 3>If you just shot in the ankle and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>starts bleeding,</v>

1226
00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:54.153
<v Speaker 3>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your tags over the money that you spent </v>

1227
00:56:56.501 --> 00:56:59.600
<v Speaker 3>is done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You failed and that thing lives to be,</v>

1228
00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:00.453
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lives to be an elk and lives another </v>

1229
00:57:02.111 --> 00:57:02.944
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another day,</v>

1230
00:57:03.070 --> 00:57:03.881
<v Speaker 3>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1231
00:57:03.881 --> 00:57:07.450
<v Speaker 3>you go back disappointed and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>start from scratch and rebuild yourself.</v>

1232
00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:11.770
<v Speaker 3>And that's good too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The failure in the feeling of failure is</v>

1233
00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:13.600
<v Speaker 3>the real motivator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what,</v>

1234
00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:14.463
<v Speaker 3>what makes you run more miles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more arrows worked hard to think about </v>

1235
00:57:18.371 --> 00:57:20.050
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think your way through this thing.</v>

1236
00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:21.213
<v Speaker 3>And to me that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that leveling of the social classes is </v>

1237
00:57:24.371 --> 00:57:25.600
<v Speaker 3>very important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1238
00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:27.730
<v Speaker 3>it's something that I think Jujitsu does</v>
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>

1239
00:57:28.010 --> 00:57:30.520
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's another parallel in that because</v>

1240
00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:33.850
<v Speaker 3>even comedy does that as well because if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not funny,</v>

1241
00:57:34.030 --> 00:57:36.000
<v Speaker 3>people don't laugh and they don't like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1242
00:57:36.330 --> 00:57:37.163
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be able to do the thing and </v>

1243
00:57:39.611 --> 00:57:43.270
<v Speaker 3>sometimes the thing doesn't work out and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you feel like fucking terrible,</v>

1244
00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:44.380
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1245
00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:49.380
<v Speaker 3>And that leveling of the classes that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens in bowhunting is a,</v>

1246
00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:51.663
<v Speaker 3>is it's hard as I keep saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to describe because it really </v>

1247
00:57:55.271 --> 00:57:56.104
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think anything that's very difficult </v>

1248
00:57:58.781 --> 00:57:59.614
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You find out more about yourself and </v>

1249
00:58:01.151 --> 00:58:03.460
<v Speaker 3>when you find out more about yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have two options.</v>

1250
00:58:03.461 --> 00:58:07.330
<v Speaker 3>Either you can go into denial or ignore </v>
<v Speaker 3>it or you know,</v>

1251
00:58:07.331 --> 00:58:08.164
<v Speaker 3>fade back or you could face it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>struggle more and get better and really </v>

1252
00:58:13.511 --> 00:58:18.511
<v Speaker 3>work at it and that's where I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>bowhunting shares a lot of,</v>

1253
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:22.023
<v Speaker 3>a lot of its aspects with other </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult but yet important things in </v>

1254
00:58:25.181 --> 00:58:26.014
<v Speaker 3>life that become.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They become a vehicle for developing </v>

1255
00:58:28.211 --> 00:58:29.680
<v Speaker 3>your human potential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1256
00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:33.580
<v Speaker 3>and that running is like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll look what it's done for you.</v>

1257
00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:34.693
<v Speaker 3>I mean your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your passion and obsession with elk </v>

1258
00:58:37.421 --> 00:58:42.010
<v Speaker 3>hunting is what led you to being this </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy ultra marathon runner.</v>

1259
00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:44.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's really what started it </v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

1260
00:58:44.021 --> 00:58:46.440
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to be better in the mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1261
00:58:46.450 --> 00:58:50.290
<v Speaker 3>better at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never really understood until I hunted</v>

1262
00:58:50.291 --> 00:58:54.910
<v Speaker 3>with you because when you would run up </v>
<v Speaker 3>the top of the fucking hill when the elk</v>

1263
00:58:54.911 --> 00:58:58.420
<v Speaker 3>would go over the top and you'd run up </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hill and I would just speech,</v>

1264
00:58:58.421 --> 00:59:01.900
<v Speaker 3>struggling to go a quarter of the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'd have to take a break and then to</v>

1265
00:59:01.901 --> 00:59:02.734
<v Speaker 3>go a little further and take a break and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you already are or up there and you </v>

1266
00:59:04.451 --> 00:59:07.090
<v Speaker 3>weren't even out of breath.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I thought about it.</v>

1267
00:59:07.091 --> 00:59:07.691
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1268
00:59:07.691 --> 00:59:09.060
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get this.</v>

1269
00:59:09.070 --> 00:59:09.910
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this.</v>

1270
00:59:09.911 --> 00:59:11.350
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1271
00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:12.270
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That.</v>

1272
00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:14.960
<v Speaker 3>And that's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1273
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:15.833
<v Speaker 3>you talked about it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy to bowhunting has done what </v>

1274
00:59:20.021 --> 00:59:22.220
<v Speaker 3>it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been on Joe Rogan</v>

1275
00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:27.220
<v Speaker 2>nine times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie nine times and you know,</v>

1276
00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:32.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't for me personally because I just</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel like I'm okay about.</v>

1277
00:59:32.601 --> 00:59:33.434
<v Speaker 2>I'm decent at bowhunting and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that I was even here one time </v>

1278
00:59:37.371 --> 00:59:39.400
<v Speaker 2>seems surreal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what I,</v>

1279
00:59:39.490 --> 00:59:40.870
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to thank,</v>

1280
00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:42.193
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about this earlier is </v>

1281
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:47.000
<v Speaker 2>because of bowhunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My people,</v>

1282
00:59:47.330 --> 00:59:48.570
<v Speaker 2>I know people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I,</v>

1283
00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:49.910
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read the comments,</v>

1284
00:59:49.911 --> 00:59:53.030
<v Speaker 2>but don't read the comments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll talk about that a,</v>

1285
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:54.343
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it must be nice for Joe to be able to </v>

1286
00:59:55.221 --> 00:59:57.530
<v Speaker 2>hunt wherever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean where we were,</v>

1287
00:59:57.531 --> 00:59:58.970
<v Speaker 2>it was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is like,</v>

1288
00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:03.740
<v Speaker 2>that's where we all kind of just where I</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel like I've had to work my whole life</v>

1289
01:00:03.741 --> 01:00:05.060
<v Speaker 2>to get to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to dream,</v>

1290
01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:08.450
<v Speaker 2>to killing bulls on public land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1291
01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:09.373
<v Speaker 2>to starting with the spike bowl to 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years of this and it's a dream and it's </v>

1292
01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:14.234
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will never take for granted what it </v>

1293
01:00:16.821 --> 01:00:18.800
<v Speaker 2>means to where we were hunting in Utah.</v>

1294
01:00:20.090 --> 01:00:25.090
<v Speaker 2>But it seems crazy to think that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>grew up in Massachusetts,</v>

1295
01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:25.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1296
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:28.880
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had the whole different journey.</v>

1297
01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:29.743
<v Speaker 2>You weren't some kid bowhunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you were a comedian and a fighter </v>

1298
01:00:33.351 --> 01:00:34.184
<v Speaker 2>and a whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But bowhunting brought us together and </v>

1299
01:00:37.791 --> 01:00:38.624
<v Speaker 2>we shared this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this life changing time and Utah from </v>

1300
01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:47.390
<v Speaker 2>completely opposite paths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so whether that's,</v>

1301
01:00:47.391 --> 01:00:49.190
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1302
01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:50.743
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you took your path to get to the best </v>

1303
01:00:53.541 --> 01:00:56.120
<v Speaker 2>outcome in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took my path.</v>

1304
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:58.070
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were hunters.</v>

1305
01:00:58.071 --> 01:00:58.904
<v Speaker 2>They're sharing the mountain and taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the challenge together and that's </v>

1306
01:01:03.051 --> 01:01:05.690
<v Speaker 2>what bowhunting does is it eliminates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1307
01:01:05.710 --> 01:01:06.543
<v Speaker 2>you're here in la.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It eliminates everything and we're the </v>

1308
01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:09.350
<v Speaker 2>same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1309
01:01:09.351 --> 01:01:10.184
<v Speaker 2>all very difficult pursuits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're limited in their bullshit and </v>

1310
01:01:13.241 --> 01:01:14.074
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1311
01:01:14.810 --> 01:01:17.480
<v Speaker 2>there's not very many things I can do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we named a few of them,</v>

1312
01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:20.420
<v Speaker 2>but it's just like when you think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it like that,</v>

1313
01:01:20.421 --> 01:01:22.370
<v Speaker 2>it seems unreal</v>

1314
01:01:23.410 --> 01:01:24.243
<v Speaker 3>real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it also sort of really clearly </v>

1315
01:01:25.991 --> 01:01:28.740
<v Speaker 3>defines why this discipline is so </v>
<v Speaker 3>important to you and I</v>

1316
01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:31.840
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] well and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1317
01:01:31.841 --> 01:01:32.674
<v Speaker 2>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And hopefully we've opened the eyes of </v>

1318
01:01:34.751 --> 01:01:38.040
<v Speaker 2>others to see that I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1319
01:01:38.410 --> 01:01:40.630
<v Speaker 2>to want that same type of experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1320
01:01:40.631 --> 01:01:42.130
<v Speaker 2>you might not be the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might not.</v>

1321
01:01:42.131 --> 01:01:45.290
<v Speaker 2>Not Everybody's going to get to where we</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunted in Utah because it's great</v>

1322
01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:46.390
<v Speaker 3>public land hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1323
01:01:46.391 --> 01:01:48.220
<v Speaker 3>I was listening to Brian Barney's </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast,</v>

1324
01:01:48.221 --> 01:01:49.054
<v Speaker 3>the Eastman elevated podcasts where he </v>
<v Speaker 3>took a couple of buddies when I was </v>

1325
01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:54.490
<v Speaker 3>actually cutting up meat today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was listening to this,</v>

1326
01:01:54.790 --> 01:01:59.200
<v Speaker 3>took a couple of buddies with him on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>public land hunt in Montana and they got</v>

1327
01:01:59.201 --> 01:02:01.840
<v Speaker 3>into some elk and they seemed like they </v>
<v Speaker 3>had an amazing time.</v>

1328
01:02:01.841 --> 01:02:02.720
<v Speaker 3>They got rained out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mrs.</v>

1329
01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:05.290
<v Speaker 3>Same sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an amazing adventure,</v>

1330
01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:06.333
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's available in a lot of different </v>

1331
01:02:07.121 --> 01:02:09.850
<v Speaker 3>forms to a lot of people and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of people that go,</v>

1332
01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:10.900
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1333
01:02:11.050 --> 01:02:12.150
<v Speaker 3>this is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1334
01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:12.993
<v Speaker 3>joe gets to do this and chose low key </v>
<v Speaker 3>and this and I think it's Hashtag </v>

1335
01:02:15.701 --> 01:02:16.840
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hashtag bullshit.</v>

1336
01:02:16.990 --> 01:02:17.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guess what?</v>

1337
01:02:18.250 --> 01:02:20.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always been lucky.</v>

1338
01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:22.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want me to be unlucky?</v>

1339
01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:23.723
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

1340
01:02:23.970 --> 01:02:25.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm just lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1341
01:02:25.051 --> 01:02:28.860
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'll be unlucky off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's also part of luck.</v>

1342
01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:32.110
<v Speaker 3>Part of luck is you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's what is that,</v>

1343
01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:36.690
<v Speaker 3>that phrase like luck is when </v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunity meets preparation.</v>

1344
01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:39.060
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what some people say.</v>

1345
01:02:39.330 --> 01:02:41.010
<v Speaker 3>It's that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also luck.</v>

1346
01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:41.910
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1347
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:43.650
<v Speaker 3>there's people that are luckier than </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1348
01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:44.281
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1349
01:02:44.281 --> 01:02:45.114
<v Speaker 3>but by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's people that are way fucking </v>

1350
01:02:46.051 --> 01:02:46.884
<v Speaker 3>luckier than me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't think Justin Bieber's lucky </v>

1351
01:02:48.301 --> 01:02:49.620
<v Speaker 3>than me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that little cunt.</v>

1352
01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:50.603
<v Speaker 3>He's never been poor in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's worth 100 million bucks and he's </v>

1353
01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:55.530
<v Speaker 3>like 20 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He probably has no comment.</v>

1354
01:02:55.531 --> 01:02:58.920
<v Speaker 3>His body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's probably everyday just drained.</v>

1355
01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:03.210
<v Speaker 3>He probably just has to eat raw eggs all</v>
<v Speaker 3>day just to try to just try to keep up.</v>

1356
01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:04.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>going to be people that are luckier than</v>

1362
01:03:16.111 --> 01:03:20.040
<v Speaker 3>you and some of it is luck and some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it is courage.</v>

1363
01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:22.170
<v Speaker 3>Some of it is putting your ass out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1364
01:03:22.171 --> 01:03:23.004
<v Speaker 3>Some of it is trying things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that I always like to </v>

1365
01:03:25.291 --> 01:03:29.460
<v Speaker 3>tell people that I think you should do </v>
<v Speaker 3>is do shit that's difficult.</v>

1366
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:32.730
<v Speaker 3>It's very important to struggle and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't mean bowhunting.</v>

1367
01:03:32.790 --> 01:03:36.660
<v Speaker 3>I liked yoga class for the same reason I</v>
<v Speaker 3>go in there,</v>

1368
01:03:36.661 --> 01:03:41.661
<v Speaker 3>it's me and a bunch of housewives and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're kicking ass more than I am.</v>

1369
01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:42.633
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched these ladies and I watched </v>

1370
01:03:44.341 --> 01:03:48.000
<v Speaker 3>their mental strength and fortitude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While they're grueling their way through</v>

1371
01:03:48.001 --> 01:03:48.834
<v Speaker 3>this 100,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four degree temperature holding these </v>

1372
01:03:50.641 --> 01:03:51.474
<v Speaker 3>poses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm watching the sweat poor off their </v>

1373
01:03:53.221 --> 01:03:56.250
<v Speaker 3>face and they're not complaining,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just in there grinding,</v>

1374
01:03:56.580 --> 01:03:57.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>

1375
01:03:57.750 --> 01:04:00.240
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking so important in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1376
01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:03.540
<v Speaker 3>This life doesn't have enough of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not enough struggle.</v>

1377
01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:06.120
<v Speaker 3>You don't get to know yourself without </v>
<v Speaker 3>struggle.</v>

1378
01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:08.610
<v Speaker 3>You don't get to know your boundaries </v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you push them.</v>

1379
01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:10.650
<v Speaker 3>You don't get to know who you are </v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

1380
01:04:10.770 --> 01:04:14.910
<v Speaker 3>unless you're tested and there's too </v>
<v Speaker 3>many weak pussies pussies out there.</v>

1381
01:04:15.090 --> 01:04:15.923
<v Speaker 3>And so those are the people that drive </v>
<v Speaker 3>me crazy because everything you just </v>

1382
01:04:18.571 --> 01:04:19.404
<v Speaker 3>said is so true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there are so many people that would </v>

1383
01:04:22.261 --> 01:04:24.570
<v Speaker 3>rather stand on the sidelines and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1384
01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:28.170
<v Speaker 3>must be nice to be able to blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

1385
01:04:28.171 --> 01:04:29.820
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shut up.</v>

1386
01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:30.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is nice.</v>

1387
01:04:30.990 --> 01:04:33.270
<v Speaker 3>It's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you worked your ass off.</v>

1388
01:04:33.330 --> 01:04:34.470
<v Speaker 3>Come follow me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitch.</v>

1389
01:04:34.830 --> 01:04:36.000
<v Speaker 3>Come,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come do what I do.</v>

1390
01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:36.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good luck.</v>

1391
01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:37.793
<v Speaker 3>Those are the people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you were talking about running was </v>

1392
01:04:40.021 --> 01:04:40.854
<v Speaker 3>so you were involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone was behind you and they were </v>

1393
01:04:43.261 --> 01:04:45.510
<v Speaker 3>like running right on your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your your tail and you're like,</v>

1394
01:04:45.511 --> 01:04:47.250
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's see how this works out for you.</v>

1395
01:04:47.970 --> 01:04:51.330
<v Speaker 3>Like it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not even a cocky thing.</v>

1396
01:04:51.331 --> 01:04:55.410
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's no way a regular </v>
<v Speaker 3>person is going to keep up with you in a</v>

1397
01:04:55.411 --> 01:04:57.480
<v Speaker 3>race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not going to happen.</v>

1398
01:04:57.930 --> 01:04:58.763
<v Speaker 3>Let's see how this works out and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just because they're not getting up at </v>

1399
01:05:02.431 --> 01:05:03.241
<v Speaker 3>5:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the morning.</v>

1400
01:05:03.241 --> 01:05:06.810
<v Speaker 3>I follow your instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your your fucking running before work.</v>

1401
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:10.630
<v Speaker 3>Right now you're running a marathon a </v>
<v Speaker 3>day for people that don't know you run.</v>

1402
01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.400
<v Speaker 3>They're literally preparing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1403
01:05:12.401 --> 01:05:14.700
<v Speaker 3>Cam is in the middle of bow hunting </v>
<v Speaker 3>season.</v>

1404
01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:17.920
<v Speaker 3>He takes a little bit of time off of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this fucking insane preparation,</v>

1405
01:05:17.921 --> 01:05:20.260
<v Speaker 3>which is good because it allows his body</v>
<v Speaker 3>to heal,</v>

1406
01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:24.340
<v Speaker 3>but he's going to compete in the Moab in</v>
<v Speaker 3>October.</v>

1407
01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:29.080
<v Speaker 3>That is 238 fucking miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a straight rate.</v>

1408
01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:31.540
<v Speaker 3>It's not 238 miles over the course of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>month.</v>

1409
01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:31.811
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1410
01:05:31.811 --> 01:05:35.650
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's 238 miles from beginning.</v>

1411
01:05:35.650 --> 01:05:39.370
<v Speaker 3>Ready go to the races.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Over 238 miles.</v>

1412
01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:40.840
<v Speaker 3>It'll take what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three days?</v>

1413
01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:42.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know.</v>

1414
01:05:42.910 --> 01:05:44.350
<v Speaker 3>Seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight hours to do two.</v>

1415
01:05:44.351 --> 01:05:44.771
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

<v Speaker 3>200.</v>

1417
01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:50.800
<v Speaker 3>And did he ran 205 fucking miles in 78 </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours.</v>

1418
01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:54.580
<v Speaker 3>So shut your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Moves.</v>

1419
01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:56.230
<v Speaker 3>Moves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Printers.</v>

1420
01:05:56.990 --> 01:06:00.110
<v Speaker 3>There's levels this life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's levels to this.</v>

1421
01:06:00.210 --> 01:06:03.940
<v Speaker 3>This dedication to discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to drive,</v>

1422
01:06:03.941 --> 01:06:05.920
<v Speaker 3>to focus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to obsession.</v>

1423
01:06:05.921 --> 01:06:06.754
<v Speaker 3>There's levels to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you're sitting on the sidelines </v>

1424
01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:10.780
<v Speaker 3>will most be noise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guess what,</v>

1425
01:06:10.781 --> 01:06:14.830
<v Speaker 3>Pussy you're not doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is my lab here.</v>

1426
01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:18.190
<v Speaker 3>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this horrendous fucking terrain.</v>

1427
01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:20.920
<v Speaker 3>They're running on a mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>GS.</v>

1428
01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:21.910
<v Speaker 3>As quite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

1429
01:06:21.911 --> 01:06:26.911
<v Speaker 3>look at this video for people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>listening only I urge you to please go.</v>

1430
01:06:27.131 --> 01:06:30.460
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does the video official trailer for</v>

1431
01:06:30.461 --> 01:06:31.900
<v Speaker 3>the Moab?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two Hundred Moab.</v>

1432
01:06:31.901 --> 01:06:33.070
<v Speaker 3>200.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I love that.</v>

1433
01:06:33.071 --> 01:06:35.140
<v Speaker 3>They call it 200.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile it's 238.</v>

1434
01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:36.020
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1435
01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:38.500
<v Speaker 3>you're not pissy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got out of the 38 miles.</v>

1436
01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:43.030
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the terrain is fucking insane.</v>

1437
01:06:43.410 --> 01:06:44.290
<v Speaker 3>It's insane.</v>

1438
01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:45.110
<v Speaker 4>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1439
01:06:45.110 --> 01:06:47.270
<v Speaker 4>That's my lab,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never run in Moab,</v>

1440
01:06:47.271 --> 01:06:49.190
<v Speaker 4>which is the draw for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

1441
01:06:49.191 --> 01:06:50.690
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been in the mountains a lot.</v>

1442
01:06:50.691 --> 01:06:53.900
<v Speaker 4>I haven't been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's going to be tough about this race</v>

1443
01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:57.200
<v Speaker 4>specifically is you see how there's no </v>
<v Speaker 4>shade.</v>

1444
01:06:57.290 --> 01:07:00.140
<v Speaker 4>So that's what we call that as it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>exposed,</v>

1445
01:07:00.141 --> 01:07:03.770
<v Speaker 4>you're exposed the whole time to the sun</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that,</v>

1446
01:07:03.830 --> 01:07:06.020
<v Speaker 4>that looks like candace right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who's a race director.</v>

1447
01:07:06.021 --> 01:07:08.150
<v Speaker 4>She's running this in this trailer right</v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

1448
01:07:08.610 --> 01:07:10.790
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so this was her brain child basically.</v>

1449
01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:12.940
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she must be a savage.</v>

1450
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:15.200
<v Speaker 4>She is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's a total stud.</v>

1451
01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:16.063
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's,</v>

1452
01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:18.360
<v Speaker 4>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's running a bunch of,</v>

1453
01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:23.870
<v Speaker 4>done really well in hundred mile ultras.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This terrain is fucking magnificent,</v>

1454
01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:25.910
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So being exposed like that,</v>

1455
01:07:25.911 --> 01:07:30.050
<v Speaker 4>that just sucks everything out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The son can just sap you and,</v>

1456
01:07:30.051 --> 01:07:31.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keeping your,</v>

1457
01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:35.180
<v Speaker 4>your skin covered as well as you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keeping hydrated,</v>

1458
01:07:35.181 --> 01:07:37.820
<v Speaker 4>keeping fueled up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just a,</v>

1459
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.990
<v Speaker 4>the name of the game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1460
01:07:38.991 --> 01:07:41.820
<v Speaker 4>what shoes will you be running on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1461
01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:42.740
<v Speaker 4>it'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1462
01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:47.060
<v Speaker 4>my under armour fat tires is what I'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>be running in because that much pounding</v>

1463
01:07:47.061 --> 01:07:51.350
<v Speaker 4>for that long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The cushion for my body is important and</v>

1464
01:07:51.351 --> 01:07:52.480
<v Speaker 4>imperative basically.</v>

1465
01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:54.580
<v Speaker 3>And the fat tires,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the underarmour fat tires.</v>

1466
01:07:54.581 --> 01:07:55.414
<v Speaker 3>How much different are they than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>under armour fat tire hunting boots </v>

1467
01:07:57.910 --> 01:08:00.530
<v Speaker 3>because I know they have those two that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the souls are similar.</v>

1468
01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:02.650
<v Speaker 3>Similar as much cushioning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1469
01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:03.633
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you get a good amount of cushioning </v>

1470
01:08:04.691 --> 01:08:06.310
<v Speaker 3>and also a good amount of traction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1471
01:08:06.311 --> 01:08:08.590
<v Speaker 3>Because basically the fat tires,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they're,</v>

1472
01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:11.440
<v Speaker 3>the reason why they're named that way is</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they essentially,</v>

1473
01:08:11.441 --> 01:08:15.830
<v Speaker 3>the bottoms of them are like a bmx rode </v>
<v Speaker 3>mountain bike,</v>

1474
01:08:15.831 --> 01:08:18.200
<v Speaker 3>mountain bike tire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had a mountain bike tire called fat</v>

1475
01:08:18.201 --> 01:08:18.970
<v Speaker 3>tire</v>

1476
01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:22.220
<v Speaker 4>and I think Michelin made it so Michelin</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes these,</v>

1477
01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:24.680
<v Speaker 4>these same souls for the under armour </v>
<v Speaker 4>shoes.</v>

1478
01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:29.660
<v Speaker 4>And that's what I generally trained in </v>
<v Speaker 4>because running a marathon a day as you.</v>

1479
01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:32.620
<v Speaker 4>That's what I was trying to do before </v>
<v Speaker 4>season season is Kinda,</v>

1480
01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:35.400
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hopefully it's context.</v>

1481
01:08:35.850 --> 01:08:36.683
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hunting season is his interrupted my </v>

1482
01:08:37.791 --> 01:08:39.560
<v Speaker 4>training.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>

1483
01:08:39.650 --> 01:08:40.483
<v Speaker 4>I sorta had this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this game plan where this would be the </v>

1484
01:08:43.251 --> 01:08:45.470
<v Speaker 4>time I'd recover.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1485
01:08:45.710 --> 01:08:50.090
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my whole training slogan is a train hard</v>

1486
01:08:50.091 --> 01:08:50.924
<v Speaker 4>hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Easy meaning that I want my training to </v>

1487
01:08:52.491 --> 01:08:57.260
<v Speaker 4>be harder than any hunt I could go on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the hunt seems like it's easier,</v>

1488
01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:01.370
<v Speaker 4>easier than my training and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's kind of what's been going on.</v>

1489
01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:03.740
<v Speaker 4>The.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the Utah country was tough.</v>

1490
01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:05.990
<v Speaker 4>It was high,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was steep.</v>

1491
01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:06.853
<v Speaker 4>There's lots of walking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was easier than running a </v>

1492
01:09:09.501 --> 01:09:11.920
<v Speaker 4>marathon a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I felt I felt good.</v>

1493
01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:13.220
<v Speaker 3>There's the fat tire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1494
01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:14.353
<v Speaker 3>So those shoes also will allow you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>run over elect sharp rocks and things </v>

1495
01:09:18.081 --> 01:09:22.340
<v Speaker 3>and it'll absorb that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it'll give your feet some protection.</v>

1496
01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:25.630
<v Speaker 3>Obviously this is an incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult pursuit that you're about.</v>

1497
01:09:25.650 --> 01:09:26.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there they are.</v>

1498
01:09:26.571 --> 01:09:27.050
<v Speaker 3>There.</v>

1499
01:09:27.050 --> 01:09:29.090
<v Speaker 4>That was a photo back home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

1500
01:09:29.770 --> 01:09:30.560
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1501
01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:33.110
<v Speaker 4>those shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've worked well for me.</v>

1502
01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:33.981
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're great.</v>

1503
01:09:33.981 --> 01:09:36.080
<v Speaker 4>They've kept my body healthy with all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the pounding.</v>

1504
01:09:36.081 --> 01:09:38.420
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people always ask about knees and hips.</v>

1505
01:09:38.610 --> 01:09:39.480
<v Speaker 3>Anything else?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1506
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:41.370
<v Speaker 3>I've run a lot in those minimalist </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoes,</v>

1507
01:09:41.371 --> 01:09:43.080
<v Speaker 3>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you could.</v>

1508
01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:44.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you could.</v>

1509
01:09:44.341 --> 01:09:48.450
<v Speaker 3>Does anybody run these fucking ultra </v>
<v Speaker 3>marathons in minimalist shoes now?</v>

1510
01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:50.610
<v Speaker 3>You can just can't write.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not that I've ever seen,</v>

1511
01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:52.950
<v Speaker 3>it just seems like it's too much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's,</v>

1512
01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:54.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's different,</v>

1513
01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:55.733
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There probably is somebody who can </v>

1514
01:09:57.210 --> 01:10:01.560
<v Speaker 3>because they're 20 some years old and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they feel great and therefore whatever.</v>

1515
01:10:01.561 --> 01:10:04.230
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's been doing it in those shoes </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a long time.</v>

1516
01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:06.120
<v Speaker 3>Their body mechanics are different than </v>
<v Speaker 3>mine,</v>

1517
01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:07.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're lighter than me,</v>

1518
01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:09.000
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe they could.</v>

1519
01:10:09.001 --> 01:10:11.010
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never loved anybody in like,</v>

1520
01:10:11.011 --> 01:10:11.970
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't do this.</v>

1521
01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:13.470
<v Speaker 3>You can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might be able to.</v>

1522
01:10:13.471 --> 01:10:14.304
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another thing too about you is </v>

1523
01:10:15.841 --> 01:10:19.470
<v Speaker 3>that you're lifting a lot of weights too</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you need it for you.</v>

1524
01:10:19.471 --> 01:10:22.860
<v Speaker 3>You also need strength for hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need strength to pull the bow back.</v>

1525
01:10:22.861 --> 01:10:24.870
<v Speaker 3>You need strength to be able to pack out</v>
<v Speaker 3>the meat.</v>

1526
01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:26.093
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of other aspects to like </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you need out of your body that </v>

1527
01:10:29.670 --> 01:10:32.810
<v Speaker 3>maybe the regular ultra marathon runner</v>

1528
01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:34.000
<v Speaker 4>doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1529
01:10:34.001 --> 01:10:34.631
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1530
01:10:34.631 --> 01:10:38.140
<v Speaker 4>I've tried to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've tweaked my training over the years.</v>

1531
01:10:38.141 --> 01:10:41.200
<v Speaker 4>There was a time where all I was doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>was running 20 miles a day,</v>

1532
01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:43.180
<v Speaker 4>not lifting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hardly eating,</v>

1533
01:10:43.181 --> 01:10:46.450
<v Speaker 4>and I was down to 157 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so now I try to,</v>

1534
01:10:46.710 --> 01:10:47.543
<v Speaker 4>I that didn't work that great for </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting because I'm trying to pack meat </v>

1535
01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.840
<v Speaker 4>and in the mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys felt tired?</v>

1536
01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:54.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just didn't feel.</v>

1537
01:10:54.530 --> 01:10:56.380
<v Speaker 4>I just didn't feel at my best.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could still kill.</v>

1538
01:10:56.381 --> 01:10:58.150
<v Speaker 4>I could still get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get the job done,</v>

1539
01:10:58.151 --> 01:11:03.151
<v Speaker 4>but I felt like I wasn't at my best.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now I feel like what I do now,</v>

1540
01:11:04.330 --> 01:11:06.430
<v Speaker 4>this is a small shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's like,</v>

1541
01:11:06.431 --> 01:11:08.180
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't be tricked by that.</v>

1542
01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:09.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm filling out the shirt</v>

1543
01:11:09.450 --> 01:11:11.540
<v Speaker 3>that's a size small size,</v>
<v Speaker 3>small Ontario.</v>

1544
01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:14.140
<v Speaker 3>That's because it jed</v>

1545
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:15.990
<v Speaker 1>fucking judd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm grateful.</v>

1546
01:11:15.991 --> 01:11:17.340
<v Speaker 1>Dead Shirt on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1547
01:11:17.341 --> 01:11:18.174
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got any.</v>

1548
01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:20.790
<v Speaker 1>You got any size mediums for me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

1549
01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:21.840
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all gone.</v>

1550
01:11:21.870 --> 01:11:24.240
<v Speaker 1>So here I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stuck with the smallest am I look like</v>

1551
01:11:24.241 --> 01:11:26.370
<v Speaker 1>a more jack that I really am pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>jacked.</v>

1552
01:11:26.371 --> 01:11:27.360
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've worked out with you.</v>

1553
01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:30.270
<v Speaker 1>Stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's just unusual for someone who,</v>

1554
01:11:30.330 --> 01:11:32.700
<v Speaker 1>an endurance athlete who does these </v>
<v Speaker 1>long,</v>

1555
01:11:32.730 --> 01:11:33.563
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 plus mile races to be packing a lot </v>

1556
01:11:36.391 --> 01:11:37.224
<v Speaker 1>of muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1557
01:11:37.310 --> 01:11:38.143
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why whenever </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone would talk about UFC fighters </v>

1558
01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:44.070
<v Speaker 1>not being able to make the weight or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1559
01:11:44.071 --> 01:11:45.160
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1560
01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:47.550
<v Speaker 1>complaints they have about not being </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to make weight.</v>

1561
01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:52.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm like my friend Cam literally you </v>
<v Speaker 1>make your body eat itself to drop down.</v>

1562
01:11:54.690 --> 01:11:57.750
<v Speaker 1>You were at 180 plus pounds before you </v>
<v Speaker 1>started.</v>

1563
01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:00.210
<v Speaker 1>And then when you went to run the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>foot,</v>

1564
01:12:00.211 --> 01:12:02.400
<v Speaker 1>200 you had do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were,</v>

1565
01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:03.263
<v Speaker 1>you were burning 3000 calories and </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating 2000 or a thousand calorie </v>

1566
01:12:07.561 --> 01:12:07.860
<v Speaker 1>deficit.</v>

1567
01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:09.840
<v Speaker 1>So if it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was burning for 83,</v>

1568
01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:12.450
<v Speaker 1>so are far as burning three 82,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1569
01:12:12.451 --> 01:12:13.800
<v Speaker 1>So I try to to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1570
01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:16.080
<v Speaker 1>be at a deficit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thousand calories every day.</v>

1571
01:12:16.170 --> 01:12:18.180
<v Speaker 1>And your body was just eating itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1572
01:12:18.181 --> 01:12:19.014
<v Speaker 1>So when I went into that race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was 160 165 and I had been in </v>

1573
01:12:24.091 --> 01:12:26.910
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 84.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I lost 19 pounds of just that calorie</v>

1574
01:12:26.911 --> 01:12:31.470
<v Speaker 1>deficit and just the key with those is </v>
<v Speaker 1>being light,</v>

1575
01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:33.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lighter you are,</v>

1576
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:37.440
<v Speaker 1>the best ultra runners are generally 140</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds,</v>

1577
01:12:37.470 --> 01:12:38.940
<v Speaker 1>maybe six foot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1578
01:12:38.941 --> 01:12:42.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean just light and that's just to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient.</v>

1579
01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:43.253
<v Speaker 1>The longer legs is more efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that why it's better to be six foot </v>

1580
01:12:46.291 --> 01:12:47.570
<v Speaker 1>and really skinny?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

1581
01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:48.413
<v Speaker 1>I've just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe I'm just kind of </v>

1582
01:12:50.010 --> 01:12:51.720
<v Speaker 1>generalizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a,</v>

1583
01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:54.690
<v Speaker 1>that seems like those are good runners </v>
<v Speaker 1>are about that size.</v>

1584
01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:56.560
<v Speaker 1>Is that like Goggins David Goggins </v>
<v Speaker 1>would.</v>

1585
01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:58.320
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a little bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1586
01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:02.010
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's more muscular than most and he's.</v>

1587
01:13:02.190 --> 01:13:04.410
<v Speaker 1>But he's a freak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a mental freak.</v>

1588
01:13:04.411 --> 01:13:05.430
<v Speaker 1>He's a freak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1589
01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:06.810
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so inspiring.</v>

1590
01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:08.640
<v Speaker 1>You ever listen to him talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1591
01:13:08.641 --> 01:13:10.800
<v Speaker 1>mental toughness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I listened to a.</v>

1592
01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:15.270
<v Speaker 1>He did a podcast with a rich roll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1593
01:13:15.271 --> 01:13:16.560
<v Speaker 1>there's another guy I love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1594
01:13:16.561 --> 01:13:18.390
<v Speaker 1>And so I listened to him on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

1595
01:13:18.570 --> 01:13:22.110
<v Speaker 1>I've listened to it like three times </v>
<v Speaker 1>because anytime you think that,</v>

1596
01:13:22.170 --> 01:13:23.190
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got a harder,</v>

1597
01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:24.630
<v Speaker 1>you can't do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that.</v>

1598
01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:28.290
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's levels come on,</v>

1599
01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:30.750
<v Speaker 1>there's levels he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's another one.</v>

1600
01:13:30.751 --> 01:13:33.330
<v Speaker 1>You can't lump everybody into the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>category and say,</v>

1601
01:13:33.331 --> 01:13:35.010
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if David Goggins did this,</v>

1602
01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:39.600
<v Speaker 1>you can't do what Dave and David Goggins</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to become David Goggins.</v>

1603
01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:41.940
<v Speaker 1>Good fucking luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't stop when I'm tired.</v>

1604
01:13:41.941 --> 01:13:42.930
<v Speaker 1>I stop when I'm done.</v>

1605
01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:44.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1606
01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:45.113
<v Speaker 1>he's intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has another saying that I think of </v>

1607
01:13:46.561 --> 01:13:49.380
<v Speaker 1>all the time when I'm running that most </v>
<v Speaker 1>people quit at 40 percent.</v>

1608
01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1609
01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:52.770
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's 100 percent true.</v>

1610
01:13:53.070 --> 01:13:54.210
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found that,</v>

1611
01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:55.183
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of times will I want to </v>

1612
01:13:56.161 --> 01:13:56.994
<v Speaker 1>quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think if I click on that picture </v>

1613
01:13:58.081 --> 01:13:58.711
<v Speaker 1>right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's a Jack Dude for someone who runs </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of miles and he did,</v>

1617
01:14:05.851 --> 01:14:06.684
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was over 300 pounds twice in his </v>

1618
01:14:09.511 --> 01:14:10.231
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1619
01:14:10.231 --> 01:14:12.070
<v Speaker 1>Fat and lethargic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

1620
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:15.790
<v Speaker 3>he wanted to be a navy seal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's over $300 there.</v>

1621
01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:16.953
<v Speaker 3>They said he had to lose something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>100 or 80 pounds and just a number of </v>

1622
01:14:20.891 --> 01:14:21.724
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he did.</v>

1623
01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:23.093
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And didn't he also break a world record </v>

1624
01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:29.060
<v Speaker 3>in suffering is the true test of life?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1625
01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:30.560
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he broke the world record in whole.</v>

1626
01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:32.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1627
01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:35.070
<v Speaker 3>How many pull ups did he do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>4,000.</v>

1628
01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:39.070
<v Speaker 3>30 in how many minutes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seventeen hours.</v>

1629
01:14:40.450 --> 01:14:42.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He fuck.</v>

1630
01:14:42.190 --> 01:14:44.980
<v Speaker 3>But he did it and I've seen some video </v>
<v Speaker 3>in 17 hours.</v>

1631
01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:45.650
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1632
01:14:45.650 --> 01:14:48.160
<v Speaker 3>his shoulders look like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the inside?</v>

1633
01:14:48.161 --> 01:14:50.500
<v Speaker 3>It's just all scar tissue holding that </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing together.</v>

1634
01:14:50.890 --> 01:14:52.630
<v Speaker 3>Let's see if they could find a video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

1635
01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:58.060
<v Speaker 3>because I've seen a video of him doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>David completed 2,588</v>

1636
01:14:58.710 --> 01:15:03.710
<v Speaker 3>pull ups in five hundred sixty six cents</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a total of four point six pull ups.</v>

1637
01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:04.753
<v Speaker 3>Preset 1000 pull ups in two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forty eight minutes and 2000 pull ups </v>

1638
01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:10.720
<v Speaker 3>and 3034 minutes.</v>

1639
01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:11.853
<v Speaker 3>But at 13 point five hours in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he felt something in his wrist snap and </v>

1640
01:15:14.501 --> 01:15:19.360
<v Speaker 3>was not able to go on an x ray at 10:30.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Confirmed a partial tear in his forearm.</v>

1641
01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:21.320
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

1642
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:22.183
<v Speaker 3>that's when he fell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He failed twice to break the record and </v>

1643
01:15:24.821 --> 01:15:27.000
<v Speaker 3>then ended up getting it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

1644
01:15:27.290 --> 01:15:30.490
<v Speaker 3>so you can get to a video because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a video of him doing it and it's</v>

1645
01:15:30.491 --> 01:15:35.491
<v Speaker 3>just savage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would do like a set a forearm apart.</v>

1646
01:15:36.250 --> 01:15:40.690
<v Speaker 3>He would do sets of five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he'd do five then dropped down,</v>

1647
01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.150
<v Speaker 3>take a break for a sec,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do five more.</v>

1648
01:15:43.151 --> 01:15:45.310
<v Speaker 3>And he kept doing that is what I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I saw that,</v>

1649
01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:46.263
<v Speaker 3>well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's that Pavle taught celine's idea </v>

1650
01:15:49.631 --> 01:15:50.464
<v Speaker 3>of a strength training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I've told you that he believes </v>

1651
01:15:53.561 --> 01:15:58.150
<v Speaker 3>that you should only look if you can do </v>
<v Speaker 3>sets of more than five,</v>

1652
01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:00.040
<v Speaker 3>that what you're doing is bodybuilding.</v>

1653
01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:03.340
<v Speaker 3>You should do five with very clean </v>
<v Speaker 3>technique,</v>

1654
01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:04.233
<v Speaker 3>take a big break and then do another </v>
<v Speaker 3>five and then just keep doing it for </v>

1655
01:16:06.341 --> 01:16:07.174
<v Speaker 3>long periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like ideally maybe some people don't </v>

1656
01:16:09.011 --> 01:16:10.480
<v Speaker 3>have the time to do those kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>workouts,</v>

1657
01:16:10.690 --> 01:16:11.523
<v Speaker 3>but he believes you should do like with </v>
<v Speaker 3>five to 10 minute rest in between </v>

1658
01:16:14.831 --> 01:16:18.160
<v Speaker 3>workouts sets and just do a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sets like that.</v>

1659
01:16:18.161 --> 01:16:21.850
<v Speaker 3>And I've been doing that for awhile now </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I feel less sore,</v>

1660
01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:22.713
<v Speaker 3>less fatigue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can do it more often and I just feel </v>

1661
01:16:25.091 --> 01:16:27.700
<v Speaker 3>like he make better progress that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1662
01:16:27.730 --> 01:16:28.563
<v Speaker 3>I think there's something to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we have a lot of like meathead </v>

1663
01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:31.473
<v Speaker 3>ideas in our head of what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to do as far as working out as </v>

1664
01:16:34.481 --> 01:16:38.370
<v Speaker 3>far as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to failure all the time with heavy</v>

1665
01:16:38.371 --> 01:16:40.000
<v Speaker 3>weights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the only way to get strong.</v>

1666
01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:42.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't necessarily think that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1667
01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:45.280
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I will say everyone's different.</v>

1668
01:16:45.310 --> 01:16:47.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this the thing where I should have a</v>

1669
01:16:47.141 --> 01:16:49.870
<v Speaker 3>caveat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a power lifter,</v>

1670
01:16:50.350 --> 01:16:52.580
<v Speaker 3>I should shut the fuck up because if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're off,</v>

1671
01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:56.890
<v Speaker 3>all you're trying to do is like massive </v>
<v Speaker 3>amounts of weight.</v>

1672
01:16:56.891 --> 01:16:59.360
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of these guys do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well then you know,</v>

1673
01:16:59.370 --> 01:17:00.203
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna push their body quite a </v>

1674
01:17:01.001 --> 01:17:02.350
<v Speaker 3>bit more than I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1675
01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:03.393
<v Speaker 3>I see guys all the time do things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>most people would say you should never </v>

1676
01:17:07.031 --> 01:17:09.100
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they have a lot of success.</v>

1677
01:17:09.190 --> 01:17:10.023
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1678
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:14.630
<v Speaker 4>nobody's going to say you should run a </v>
<v Speaker 4>marathon everyday during your say that's</v>

1679
01:17:14.631 --> 01:17:17.510
<v Speaker 4>a good way to get injured and that's too</v>
<v Speaker 4>much in your body.</v>

1680
01:17:17.511 --> 01:17:18.344
<v Speaker 4>You're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not getting the most out of your </v>

1681
01:17:19.431 --> 01:17:20.720
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody's like,</v>

1682
01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:23.270
<v Speaker 4>when I lift,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I try to do tons of reps,</v>

1683
01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:25.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least 20 reps per set.</v>

1684
01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:27.260
<v Speaker 4>But you're doing lighter weights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1685
01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:29.680
<v Speaker 4>You're not trying to go to failure with </v>
<v Speaker 4>heavy weights,</v>

1686
01:17:29.730 --> 01:17:33.560
<v Speaker 4>trying to go to failure with everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so if 20 doesn't get it then I'll do</v>

1687
01:17:33.770 --> 01:17:34.790
<v Speaker 4>40.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1688
01:17:34.791 --> 01:17:35.624
<v Speaker 4>So it's been a unit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not trying to go to failure with </v>

1689
01:17:36.801 --> 01:17:37.281
<v Speaker 4>like three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1690
01:17:37.281 --> 01:17:38.460
<v Speaker 4>five for Ben.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1691
01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:38.790
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1692
01:17:38.790 --> 01:17:39.870
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See that's what I'm talking about.</v>

1693
01:17:39.871 --> 01:17:41.480
<v Speaker 4>And that's where people get hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1694
01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:46.250
<v Speaker 4>but so people need to find what works </v>
<v Speaker 4>for them basically.</v>

1695
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:47.143
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of schools of thought on </v>

1696
01:17:48.561 --> 01:17:49.131
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1697
01:17:49.131 --> 01:17:53.510
<v Speaker 4>for the average person do this and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>works for most people,</v>

1698
01:17:53.690 --> 01:17:54.523
<v Speaker 4>but it's not going to work for David </v>
<v Speaker 4>Goggins or depends on your goals and </v>

1699
01:17:57.171 --> 01:17:58.004
<v Speaker 4>your body and your ability and what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to accomplish and your </v>

1700
01:18:00.561 --> 01:18:01.394
<v Speaker 4>dedication.</v>

1701
01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:05.190
<v Speaker 3>What is the standard routine for someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's trying to run an ultra marathon?</v>

1702
01:18:05.191 --> 01:18:06.920
<v Speaker 3>So if you're running a marathon a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that,</v>

1703
01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:09.140
<v Speaker 3>is that a normal thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what do they,</v>

1704
01:18:09.210 --> 01:18:10.890
<v Speaker 3>what do you guys communicate with each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other?</v>

1705
01:18:10.891 --> 01:18:12.630
<v Speaker 3>Because it was only a handful of yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1706
01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:14.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you talked to those people are just</v>

1707
01:18:14.821 --> 01:18:16.740
<v Speaker 3>doing what you think you should do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1708
01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:18.630
<v Speaker 3>I have never talked to anybody about </v>
<v Speaker 3>training.</v>

1709
01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:19.830
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1710
01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:20.903

<v Speaker 3>So you just go out there and do your </v>

1711
01:18:22.771 --> 01:18:23.604
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>this guy.</v>

1718
01:18:39.651 --> 01:18:40.484
<v Speaker 4>I think he's about 26.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He lives down in Arizona and he's been </v>

1719
01:18:43.901 --> 01:18:46.690
<v Speaker 4>trying to break the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>western states.</v>

1720
01:18:46.691 --> 01:18:49.570
<v Speaker 4>100 ultra marathon record for two years </v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

1721
01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:50.433
<v Speaker 4>Last year he was on pace to break it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like at a mile 90 and I don't </v>

1722
01:18:56.161 --> 01:18:57.960
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20,</v>

1723
01:18:57.990 --> 01:18:59.500
<v Speaker 4>40 some minutes ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>

1724
01:18:59.501 --> 01:19:02.830
<v Speaker 4>record pace took the wrong turn because </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is in the mountains,</v>

1725
01:19:02.831 --> 01:19:07.780
<v Speaker 4>it starts at squaw valley and ends and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Auburn took her the wrong trail and went</v>

1726
01:19:07.781 --> 01:19:12.010
<v Speaker 4>off course and ended up finishing 20th,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1727
01:19:12.011 --> 01:19:15.550
<v Speaker 4>because he had to backtrack and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>mentally broke him.</v>

1728
01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:17.313
<v Speaker 4>So he was going to come back this year </v>
<v Speaker 4>better than ever and his training and </v>

1729
01:19:20.711 --> 01:19:25.711
<v Speaker 4>he'd be like running 140 mile weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so 20 miles a day,</v>

1730
01:19:26.410 --> 01:19:27.243
<v Speaker 4>a 100,</v>
<v Speaker 4>150 mile weeks or some guys that have </v>

1731
01:19:30.730 --> 01:19:32.390
<v Speaker 4>that do more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>

1732
01:19:32.410 --> 01:19:35.470
<v Speaker 4>this year he came in and he went again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Went ahead.</v>

1733
01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:36.773
<v Speaker 4>A was ahead of course record pace and an</v>
<v Speaker 4>ultra marathon term or maybe a running </v>

1734
01:19:40.811 --> 01:19:44.380
<v Speaker 4>term in general as he blew up at mile 76</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

1735
01:19:44.590 --> 01:19:46.300
<v Speaker 4>And had to drop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She went to hard.</v>

1736
01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:48.160
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1737
01:19:48.161 --> 01:19:48.940
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's,</v>

1738
01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:50.030
<v Speaker 4>he's doing record.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

1739
01:19:50.031 --> 01:19:52.840
<v Speaker 4>what is he trying to break the record </v>
<v Speaker 4>for?</v>

1740
01:19:52.841 --> 01:19:57.280
<v Speaker 4>That is like 14 something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fourteen hours now.</v>

1741
01:19:57.281 --> 01:19:57.770

<v Speaker 4>is that</v>

1742
01:19:57.770 --> 01:20:02.740
<v Speaker 3>there's a guy who just broke the ultra </v>
<v Speaker 3>marathon record for a flat,</v>

1743
01:20:03.190 --> 01:20:05.560
<v Speaker 3>like a flat 100.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not In the mountains like you do,</v>

1744
01:20:05.561 --> 01:20:09.630
<v Speaker 3>but a flat one and he's on an off like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>high fat diet.</v>

1745
01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:10.980
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't he on Jamie?</v>

1746
01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:11.993
<v Speaker 3>We talked about that guy recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's on a ketogenic diet and he broke </v>

1747
01:20:15.630 --> 01:20:16.463
<v Speaker 3>the was on the track is a 24 hour record</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he ran a 100 and I can't remember </v>

1748
01:20:21.181 --> 01:20:23.130
<v Speaker 3>how many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many miles it was.</v>

1749
01:20:23.230 --> 01:20:24.063
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you felt like maybe for the </v>

1750
01:20:27.361 --> 01:20:30.090
<v Speaker 3>mountains you might want to alter your </v>
<v Speaker 3>diet.</v>

1751
01:20:30.410 --> 01:20:33.750
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe that's not the for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1752
01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:37.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean have you ever tried to like a fat</v>
<v Speaker 3>based diet or a Ketogenic Diet?</v>

1753
01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:40.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my buddies I've,</v>

1754
01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:43.950
<v Speaker 3>I lived with back home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nick Hammon and Eric Mccormack there.</v>

1755
01:20:44.010 --> 01:20:46.890
<v Speaker 3>They both do bodybuilding competitions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strengths,</v>

1756
01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:49.830
<v Speaker 3>but exactly outlaw strength.</v>

1757
01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:52.350
<v Speaker 3>I love that Guy Dude and nick the </v>
<v Speaker 3>trainer dude.</v>

1758
01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:55.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so to get lean for those shows,</v>

1759
01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:57.173
<v Speaker 3>basically you cut the carbs out and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is many proteins in Greens as you want </v>

1760
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:02.183
<v Speaker 3>so you can have salad and steak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I've done that and I've got down to </v>

1761
01:21:04.801 --> 01:21:05.634
<v Speaker 3>six percent body fat just to see what it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like and that's essentially what </v>

1762
01:21:08.641 --> 01:21:09.474
<v Speaker 3>that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And do you feel like you perform any </v>

1763
01:21:11.281 --> 01:21:12.890
<v Speaker 3>differently?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Terrible,</v>

1764
01:21:13.530 --> 01:21:14.670
<v Speaker 3>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible.</v>

1765
01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:16.860
<v Speaker 3>It felt terrible about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1766
01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:18.960
<v Speaker 3>no strength,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no endurance.</v>

1767
01:21:19.050 --> 01:21:20.810
<v Speaker 3>Because no carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

1768
01:21:20.850 --> 01:21:22.840
<v Speaker 3>So zero carbs like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1769
01:21:22.841 --> 01:21:23.190
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1770
01:21:23.190 --> 01:21:24.023
<v Speaker 3>Like just vegetables for the know on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>low carb day it'd be 50 to 75 grams of </v>

1771
01:21:28.651 --> 01:21:29.484
<v Speaker 3>carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever get your blood sugar check </v>

1772
01:21:31.561 --> 01:21:33.990
<v Speaker 3>to see if your key to genic and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1773
01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:34.913
<v Speaker 3>No I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting because I feel I feel </v>

1774
01:21:37.461 --> 01:21:39.600
<v Speaker 3>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very important to talk about that.</v>

1775
01:21:39.630 --> 01:21:41.260
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's body is different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1776
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:42.263
<v Speaker 3>You know who's a great proponent of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is robb wolf and one of the really </v>

1777
01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:47.910
<v Speaker 3>interesting things about rob was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientist and a very,</v>

1778
01:21:47.911 --> 01:21:50.520
<v Speaker 3>very smart guy when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>nutrition and health rights,</v>

1779
01:21:50.521 --> 01:21:52.050
<v Speaker 3>about books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about Paleo diets,</v>

1780
01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:53.213
<v Speaker 3>but one of the more interesting things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that rob does is he will eat the same </v>

1781
01:21:55.531 --> 01:22:00.270
<v Speaker 3>thing as his wife and they'll both to </v>
<v Speaker 3>test themselves,</v>

1782
01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:01.133
<v Speaker 3>test their blood and he'll do it on </v>
<v Speaker 3>video and his wife is consistently more </v>

1783
01:22:04.861 --> 01:22:08.490
<v Speaker 3>adaptive than he is like they're eating </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same thing like it should,</v>

1784
01:22:08.491 --> 01:22:12.680
<v Speaker 3>but but his body for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't perform as well.</v>

1785
01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:15.270
<v Speaker 3>Processing carbohydrates as hers does </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I say,</v>

1786
01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:19.740
<v Speaker 3>and she didn't stay in a ketogenic state</v>
<v Speaker 3>and eat far more carbs than he can.</v>

1787
01:22:19.770 --> 01:22:22.410
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna let you in on a,</v>

1788
01:22:22.510 --> 01:22:24.390
<v Speaker 3>on a little secret.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1789
01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:27.150
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what the hell </v>
<v Speaker 3>ketogenic means.</v>

1790
01:22:28.830 --> 01:22:30.840
<v Speaker 3>I've heard Quito,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Quito,</v>

1791
01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:31.703
<v Speaker 3>jet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1792
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.270
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what is it?</v>

1793
01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:36.000
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In a state of Ketosis,</v>

1794
01:22:36.090 --> 01:22:36.923
<v Speaker 3>your body burns off fat instead of </v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates and you have to have an </v>

1795
01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:42.773
<v Speaker 3>adaptation period where your body goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>from carbohydrates to fats as a fuel </v>

1796
01:22:48.151 --> 01:22:53.151
<v Speaker 3>source and your brain uses ketones in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your body,</v>

1797
01:22:53.311 --> 01:22:56.640
<v Speaker 3>uses ketones for fuel instead of </v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates and glucose.</v>

1798
01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:59.520
<v Speaker 3>Is there an advantage?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1799
01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:02.130
<v Speaker 3>and I would suggest that anybody who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in this,</v>

1800
01:23:02.350 --> 01:23:05.740
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to my podcast with Dom D'agostino,</v>

1801
01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 3>it</v>

1802
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:06.873
<v Speaker 1>was four months ago maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Tim Ferriss podcast with Dom </v>

1803
01:23:12.670 --> 01:23:15.160
<v Speaker 1>D'agostino is also an excellent </v>
<v Speaker 1>resource.</v>

1804
01:23:15.490 --> 01:23:18.260
<v Speaker 1>And there's advantages in terms of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1805
01:23:18.350 --> 01:23:21.310
<v Speaker 1>your body's ability to fight off disease</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cancer.</v>

1806
01:23:21.370 --> 01:23:24.670
<v Speaker 1>Cognitive ability improves and we'd be </v>
<v Speaker 1>smarter,</v>

1807
01:23:24.671 --> 01:23:26.170
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I doubt it.</v>

1808
01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:29.680
<v Speaker 1>But could I be better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

1809
01:23:29.690 --> 01:23:30.523
<v Speaker 1>Nine 94.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not episode nine slash 90 for this </v>

1810
01:23:32.681 --> 01:23:34.030
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah,</v>

1811
01:23:34.031 --> 01:23:36.140
<v Speaker 1>you'd Bowhunt Austin minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1812
01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:37.900
<v Speaker 1>I just think you need a lot of fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

1813
01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:42.280
<v Speaker 1>And maybe with your diet you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking in enough fat.</v>

1814
01:23:42.370 --> 01:23:45.610
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to have a lot of fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal fat.</v>

1815
01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:47.410
<v Speaker 1>That's the Cahtos yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing.</v>

1816
01:23:47.411 --> 01:23:50.290
<v Speaker 1>Coconut oil told me the other day </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was just like,</v>

1817
01:23:50.380 --> 01:23:55.030
<v Speaker 1>we lifted and I'm so weak because I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>running so much.</v>

1818
01:23:55.031 --> 01:23:57.250
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we did it.</v>

1819
01:23:57.310 --> 01:23:58.143
<v Speaker 1>We did a just a few quick calculations </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you run a marathon a day at my </v>

1820
01:24:03.191 --> 01:24:05.050
<v Speaker 1>way it was.</v>

1821
01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:07.290
<v Speaker 1>And then just living because just </v>
<v Speaker 1>living,</v>

1822
01:24:07.310 --> 01:24:12.310
<v Speaker 1>you're going to burn 1700 calories a day</v>
<v Speaker 1>or me then plus the 3,300</v>

1823
01:24:12.370 --> 01:24:15.010
<v Speaker 1>or something that I'd burn when running </v>
<v Speaker 1>a marathon.</v>

1824
01:24:15.011 --> 01:24:18.950
<v Speaker 1>So it was like 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>calories and as eating three row,</v>

1825
01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:22.030
<v Speaker 1>2000 deficit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1826
01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:23.320
<v Speaker 1>that's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1827
01:24:23.321 --> 01:24:27.160
<v Speaker 1>So he said I needed to just ramp up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fats,</v>

1828
01:24:27.290 --> 01:24:29.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it started hammering nuts,</v>

1829
01:24:29.321 --> 01:24:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Avocados,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

1830
01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:32.560
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually did.</v>

1831
01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:34.870
<v Speaker 1>I was feeling better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We lifted again and I felt better.</v>

1832
01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:35.793
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's the big part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>key to genic died that people get wrong </v>

1833
01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:39.993
<v Speaker 1>is that ketogenic diet is primarily fats</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you have an adequate amount of </v>

1834
01:24:43.931 --> 01:24:46.570
<v Speaker 1>protein dependent upon how much activity</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>

1835
01:24:46.990 --> 01:24:51.400
<v Speaker 1>You obviously do a lot of activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would need more protein than most.</v>

1836
01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:55.090
<v Speaker 1>And I think you would also probably need</v>
<v Speaker 1>more actual carbohydrates in most.</v>

1837
01:24:55.180 --> 01:24:56.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And still stay in Ketosis.</v>

1838
01:24:56.951 --> 01:24:57.784
<v Speaker 1>I think if that's probably one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons why you were so tired and you </v>

1839
01:25:00.221 --> 01:25:01.054
<v Speaker 1>felt weak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also I think this thing that you're </v>

1840
01:25:03.131 --> 01:25:07.750
<v Speaker 1>doing most people are just not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do not going to burn three and eat too.</v>

1841
01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:11.410
<v Speaker 1>They're just not going to do print print</v>
<v Speaker 1>for getting ready for 200 mile race.</v>

1842
01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:12.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

1843
01:25:12.910 --> 01:25:16.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to figure it out as I go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't talk to this is what freaks</v>

1844
01:25:16.601 --> 01:25:17.434
<v Speaker 1>me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't talk to other ultra </v>

1845
01:25:18.401 --> 01:25:23.401
<v Speaker 1>marathon people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate people like me.</v>

1846
01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:26.320
<v Speaker 1>I do know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

1847
01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:28.890
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like a lot of people,</v>

1848
01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:30.560
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like um,</v>

1849
01:25:31.930 --> 01:25:33.940
<v Speaker 1>most people fall short of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>expectations.</v>

1850
01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:35.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like winners.</v>

1851
01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:36.333
<v Speaker 1>I like strong people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like people who don't judge other </v>

1852
01:25:38.441 --> 01:25:39.274
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

1853
01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:41.860
<v Speaker 1>you don't like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I judge everybody know,</v>

1854
01:25:41.861 --> 01:25:43.150
<v Speaker 1>judge you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just Jamie,</v>

1855
01:25:43.210 --> 01:25:48.210
<v Speaker 1>no fucking shirt he's wearing now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I just don't like complainers.</v>

1856
01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:53.200
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's not a,</v>

1857
01:25:53.590 --> 01:25:55.210
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot of people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1858
01:25:56.030 --> 01:25:58.210
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to respect people.</v>

1859
01:25:58.270 --> 01:25:59.103
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that with the level of output </v>

1860
01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:03.980
<v Speaker 1>that you are putting out and the amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of focus and dedication to these things,</v>

1861
01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:08.150
<v Speaker 3>the amount of obsession to performing at</v>
<v Speaker 3>a 200 plus mile race,</v>

1862
01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:13.990
<v Speaker 3>a whiny bullshit that you hear is just </v>
<v Speaker 3>so much more magnified than what I hear.</v>

1863
01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:15.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1864
01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:18.500
<v Speaker 3>like if I hear whiny stuff for my seven </v>
<v Speaker 3>year old,</v>

<v Speaker 3>or you're going to be okay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You're going to beat me up.</v>

1869

<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on punk.</v>

<v Speaker 3>and play around together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But she's savvy them.</v>

<v Speaker 3>The thing that keeps us alive that </v>

1877
01:26:46.491 --> 01:26:50.330
<v Speaker 3>people struggled to find in most of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>free world comes out of a fucking.</v>

1878
01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:54.110
<v Speaker 3>You have a lever and you're sinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>every sink in every bathroom.</v>

1879
01:26:54.111 --> 01:26:56.270
<v Speaker 3>We could just drink fresh water.</v>

1885
01:27:04.111 --> 01:27:05.040
<v Speaker 4>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1886
01:27:05.070 --> 01:27:06.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's,</v>

1887
01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:08.010
<v Speaker 4>that's the kind of stuff that's been </v>
<v Speaker 4>nice.</v>

1888
01:27:08.070 --> 01:27:08.903
<v Speaker 4>I pretty much don't listen to anybody </v>
<v Speaker 4>except people who I know share my </v>

1889
01:27:12.931 --> 01:27:15.480
<v Speaker 4>mindset about not just on running or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

1890
01:27:15.481 --> 01:27:16.350
<v Speaker 4>just about in life.</v>

1891
01:27:16.450 --> 01:27:17.283
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why I'm just confused as to why </v>

1892
01:27:18.491 --> 01:27:19.324
<v Speaker 3>you don't have a group of people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're close to that are also ultra </v>

1893
01:27:22.061 --> 01:27:23.830
<v Speaker 3>marathon runners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can compare notes with.</v>

1894
01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:25.960
<v Speaker 4>There's not a lot of people that do </v>
<v Speaker 4>those.</v>

1895
01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:26.531
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1896
01:27:26.531 --> 01:27:28.180
<v Speaker 4>ultra.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My brother does ultras.</v>

1897
01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:33.360
<v Speaker 4>My brother is a stud.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So how odd he,</v>

1898
01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:34.893
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1899
01:27:35.290 --> 01:27:36.700
<v Speaker 4>some genetics in that family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

1900
01:27:36.730 --> 01:27:40.380
<v Speaker 4>Was Your Dad is a big time athlete to </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually my dad.</v>

1901
01:27:40.630 --> 01:27:45.630
<v Speaker 4>I have no talent compared to my dad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So my dad was an ultra,</v>

1902
01:27:45.790 --> 01:27:47.830
<v Speaker 4>just not ultra marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ultra freak.</v>

1903
01:27:47.831 --> 01:27:49.560
<v Speaker 4>He was just an athletic freak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1904
01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:51.580
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my,</v>

1905
01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:52.810
<v Speaker 4>my brother,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1906
01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:55.500
<v Speaker 4>he does a lot of miles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't really even,</v>

1907
01:27:55.690 --> 01:27:58.150
<v Speaker 4>we just kind of do our own thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We know what it takes.</v>

1908
01:27:58.540 --> 01:27:59.373
<v Speaker 4>You got to pound out miles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You Dad was trying to compete in the </v>

1909
01:28:00.941 --> 01:28:01.774
<v Speaker 4>Olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1910
01:28:02.090 --> 01:28:02.441
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1911
01:28:02.441 --> 01:28:02.921
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

1912
01:28:02.921 --> 01:28:07.000
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he had Olympic potential.</v>

1913
01:28:07.060 --> 01:28:08.640
<v Speaker 4>So what happened is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1914
01:28:09.490 --> 01:28:12.760
<v Speaker 4>he was a high jumper and a long jumper </v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

1915
01:28:12.850 --> 01:28:13.191
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1916
01:28:13.191 --> 01:28:14.440
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I took,</v>

1917
01:28:14.441 --> 01:28:19.441
<v Speaker 4>my daughter was doing pole vaulting last</v>
<v Speaker 4>year in and they kinda hurt.</v>

1918
01:28:19.630 --> 01:28:23.710
<v Speaker 4>My Dad was a awesome pole vaulter at </v>
<v Speaker 4>South Eugene high school.</v>

1919
01:28:23.711 --> 01:28:28.711
<v Speaker 4>He was the first athlete inducted in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>hall of fame and uh,</v>

1920
01:28:30.010 --> 01:28:32.490
<v Speaker 4>they did that right before he died.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

1921
01:28:33.130 --> 01:28:36.220
<v Speaker 4>in the south Eugene Hall of Famer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that high school there in Eugene is,</v>

1922
01:28:36.490 --> 01:28:37.540
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anyway,</v>

1923
01:28:37.541 --> 01:28:39.340
<v Speaker 4>so he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1924
01:28:39.970 --> 01:28:43.090
<v Speaker 4>these coaches at where my daughter was </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing pole vaulting,</v>

1925
01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:44.373
<v Speaker 4>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1926
01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:45.213
<v Speaker 4>after a few different practices they had</v>
<v Speaker 4>heard about her and me and her grandpa </v>

1927
01:28:50.021 --> 01:28:51.300
<v Speaker 4>was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so he's,</v>

1928
01:28:51.301 --> 01:28:52.660
<v Speaker 4>he comes up and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>

1929
01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:53.513
<v Speaker 4>was your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1930
01:28:54.020 --> 01:28:55.870
<v Speaker 4>your dad Bob Haynes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

1931
01:28:55.900 --> 01:28:56.920
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>

1932
01:28:56.930 --> 01:28:58.510
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1933
01:28:58.511 --> 01:29:01.350
<v Speaker 4>he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a legend around here because they</v>

1934
01:29:01.351 --> 01:29:03.970
<v Speaker 4>went to high school together and now </v>
<v Speaker 4>they've been coaching rather.</v>

1935
01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:09.000
<v Speaker 4>And he just said that everybody knew Bob</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hanes and he could do things nobody else</v>

1936
01:29:09.001 --> 01:29:09.834
<v Speaker 4>could do and what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think where he would have his success </v>

1937
01:29:13.801 --> 01:29:17.340
<v Speaker 4>was in high jump and he could high jump </v>
<v Speaker 4>six four.</v>

1938
01:29:17.670 --> 01:29:20.520
<v Speaker 4>And what he did at that time was called </v>
<v Speaker 4>the western roll.</v>

1939
01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:21.533
<v Speaker 4>And so you just kinda roll over the bar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he'd competed against Dick </v>

1940
01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:27.840
<v Speaker 4>Fosbury and he invented the Fosbury </v>
<v Speaker 4>flop.</v>

1941
01:29:27.841 --> 01:29:31.470
<v Speaker 4>So you'd go with your back to the bar </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then kick your legs over.</v>

1942
01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:36.780
<v Speaker 4>And so they would compete.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And my dad got earned a scholarship at,</v>

1943
01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:37.733
<v Speaker 4>at Oregon for gymnastics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then Oregon State for track when </v>

1944
01:29:40.441 --> 01:29:41.274
<v Speaker 4>they had track and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ended up dropping out of both of both </v>

1945
01:29:45.331 --> 01:29:46.770
<v Speaker 4>schools.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1946
01:29:46.771 --> 01:29:49.190
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they said that he would,</v>

1947
01:29:49.250 --> 01:29:51.990
<v Speaker 4>he get high jumped six floor during the </v>
<v Speaker 4>western roll.</v>

1948
01:29:51.991 --> 01:29:52.824
<v Speaker 4>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1949
01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:53.783
<v Speaker 4>we're going to teach you that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Fosbury flop and we should build to add </v>

1950
01:29:56.551 --> 01:29:57.384
<v Speaker 4>eight to 12 inches onto your jumps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that'll put them at seven feet and </v>

1951
01:30:00.361 --> 01:30:04.000
<v Speaker 4>that would have been up there with Dick </v>
<v Speaker 4>Fosbury and um,</v>

1952
01:30:04.590 --> 01:30:05.423
<v Speaker 4>and Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So my dad ended up dropping out of </v>

1953
01:30:07.081 --> 01:30:09.930
<v Speaker 4>school or in whatever happened in I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>born.</v>

1954
01:30:09.930 --> 01:30:11.430
<v Speaker 4>And then my brother was born,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1955
01:30:11.431 --> 01:30:12.264
<v Speaker 4>how life gets in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then meanwhile a Dick Fosbury went </v>

1956
01:30:15.271 --> 01:30:16.104
<v Speaker 4>to the Olympics and won the gold medal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's just who knows what would </v>

1957
01:30:19.381 --> 01:30:21.750
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the fact is,</v>

1958
01:30:21.751 --> 01:30:23.880
<v Speaker 4>he was an amazing athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1959
01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:24.753
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you just want to say just in high </v>

1960
01:30:25.711 --> 01:30:26.544
<v Speaker 4>school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's fine.</v>

1961
01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:27.540
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1962
01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:28.373
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a d one athlete in two different </v>

1963
01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:31.590
<v Speaker 4>sports.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I didn't,</v>

1964
01:30:31.591 --> 01:30:33.870
<v Speaker 4>I never had that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have that potential.</v>

1965
01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:37.730
<v Speaker 4>What I have is just a hard work ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

1966
01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:39.980
<v Speaker 4>that's what I've translate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>

1967
01:30:40.230 --> 01:30:44.250
<v Speaker 4>without the Olympic or without the </v>
<v Speaker 4>athletic talents,</v>

1968
01:30:44.251 --> 01:30:45.084
<v Speaker 4>maybe that he has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might have the words work ethic that </v>

1969
01:30:49.171 --> 01:30:52.920
<v Speaker 4>might match a talent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what I've used to do.</v>

1970
01:30:52.921 --> 01:30:54.930
<v Speaker 4>Ultras because basically that's just </v>
<v Speaker 4>been tough.</v>

1971
01:30:55.320 --> 01:30:57.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was just grinding and,</v>

1972
01:30:58.050 --> 01:30:58.883
<v Speaker 4>and put in miles and training and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting where everybody else wants to </v>

1973
01:31:01.981 --> 01:31:04.860
<v Speaker 4>quit and pushing through in the races.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you don't.</v>

1974
01:31:05.150 --> 01:31:05.983
<v Speaker 3>I have a few friends like I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was the woman's name that runs </v>

1975
01:31:09.291 --> 01:31:11.390
<v Speaker 3>candice?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Candice Bergen friends with her.</v>

1976
01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:14.450
<v Speaker 3>And he and your friends with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>brother obviously who also runs ultra?</v>

1977
01:31:14.451 --> 01:31:15.284
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have other friends that do this </v>

1978
01:31:17.601 --> 01:31:19.790
<v Speaker 3>that you like email with or text </v>
<v Speaker 3>message?</v>

1979
01:31:19.791 --> 01:31:22.220
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is that normal?</v>

1980
01:31:22.580 --> 01:31:25.450
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean ultra runners in general are,</v>

1981
01:31:25.930 --> 01:31:28.690
<v Speaker 4>are a fucking Weirdos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Weirdos,</v>

1982
01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:31.480
<v Speaker 4>but I'm independent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1983
01:31:31.780 --> 01:31:32.710
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to be,</v>

1984
01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:34.810
<v Speaker 4>you can't rely on anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1985
01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:38.950
<v Speaker 4>you can't see who's going to tell me to </v>
<v Speaker 4>go run a marathon every day.</v>

1986
01:31:39.310 --> 01:31:41.200
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's gonna say that's too much.</v>

1987
01:31:41.201 --> 01:31:42.034
<v Speaker 4>You don't need to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like ultra runners are </v>

1988
01:31:44.621 --> 01:31:45.454
<v Speaker 4>independent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How long have they been doing ultra </v>

1989
01:31:46.351 --> 01:31:49.000
<v Speaker 4>marathons?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1990
01:31:49.001 --> 01:31:53.800
<v Speaker 4>the western states 100 started in 1974.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

1991
01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:55.233
<v Speaker 4>And what was the old times like?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was like a good time back then to </v>

1992
01:31:57.911 --> 01:31:58.744
<v Speaker 4>do 100?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What they seeing the western states </v>

1993
01:32:00.431 --> 01:32:02.440
<v Speaker 4>started as a horse race and they still </v>
<v Speaker 4>do it.</v>

1994
01:32:02.650 --> 01:32:05.440
<v Speaker 4>It's courses yet the [inaudible] Cup and</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's,</v>

1995
01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:10.800
<v Speaker 4>it's the same course with the same goal </v>
<v Speaker 4>is covered 100 miles in under 24 hours.</v>

1996
01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:16.120
<v Speaker 4>So if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get the buckle and it says 100 miles</v>

1997
01:32:16.121 --> 01:32:20.140
<v Speaker 4>one day and that's like the gold metal </v>
<v Speaker 4>full for an ultra runner.</v>

1998
01:32:21.070 --> 01:32:26.070
<v Speaker 4>So they have that same thing for horses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Gordon Ainslie was,</v>

1999
01:32:27.610 --> 01:32:31.300
<v Speaker 4>he was in the horse race,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his horse came up lame and he said,</v>

2000
01:32:31.301 --> 01:32:33.460
<v Speaker 4>well I'm going to finish it on my own,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on his,</v>

2001
01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:35.050
<v Speaker 4>on his feet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>

2002
01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:36.393
<v Speaker 4>And so he did that and that's where </v>
<v Speaker 4>western states endurance race or run </v>

2003
01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:42.370
<v Speaker 4>began because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well let's just,</v>

2004
01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:44.560
<v Speaker 4>let's just do this on our feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What a fucking animal.</v>

2005
01:32:44.561 --> 01:32:45.394
<v Speaker 4>That guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2006
01:32:45.610 --> 01:32:47.890
<v Speaker 4>And he still competes in the western </v>
<v Speaker 4>states right now.</v>

2007
01:32:47.891 --> 01:32:49.300
<v Speaker 4>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How old is he?</v>

2008
01:32:49.450 --> 01:32:51.110
<v Speaker 4>But he can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He can't break 20 week.</v>

2009
01:32:51.250 --> 01:32:52.083
<v Speaker 4>He can't even break.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you can get a buckle 100 miles one </v>

2010
01:32:54.521 --> 01:32:59.521
<v Speaker 4>day if you break 24,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you break 30 you get a cookie and you</v>

2011
01:33:00.431 --> 01:33:02.590
<v Speaker 4>get a buckle up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just is western states endurance run.</v>

2012
01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:07.510
<v Speaker 4>But if you don't break 30 you get </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>

2013
01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:13.330
<v Speaker 4>So he's tried for I think when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I ran it in 2010.</v>

2014
01:33:14.350 --> 01:33:19.350
<v Speaker 4>God what was he 60 some.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably he at the 30 mile cutoff.</v>

2015
01:33:20.231 --> 01:33:25.231
<v Speaker 4>He was at like the 90 some mile cutoff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the 30 hour cutoff.</v>

2016
01:33:26.710 --> 01:33:27.543
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so he was at the 97 mile at 30 </v>

2017
01:33:30.341 --> 01:33:30.920
<v Speaker 4>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that it,</v>

2018
01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:32.020
<v Speaker 4>he was done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2019
01:33:32.170 --> 01:33:33.003
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he tries every year and he gets a </v>

2020
01:33:34.451 --> 01:33:39.040
<v Speaker 4>long way from being 70.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's over 70 now.</v>

2021
01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:40.210
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2022
01:33:40.510 --> 01:33:41.343
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he started that and that was in the </v>

2023
01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:46.450
<v Speaker 4>seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then nowadays there's more races.</v>

2024
01:33:46.451 --> 01:33:47.284
<v Speaker 4>Every state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty a lot of states out west have </v>

2025
01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:50.531
<v Speaker 4>hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2026
01:33:50.531 --> 01:33:51.364
<v Speaker 4>that's Kinda the ultra scene is in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mountains out here as they do the ones </v>

2027
01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:56.713
<v Speaker 4>the mountains will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That western states is in the mountains </v>

2028
01:33:58.691 --> 01:34:00.220
<v Speaker 4>and mountains that starts at squaw </v>
<v Speaker 4>valley.</v>

2029
01:34:00.250 --> 01:34:05.200
<v Speaker 4>So it was a lot of elevation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of that race has 41,000</v>

2030
01:34:05.201 --> 01:34:06.370
<v Speaker 4>feet of elevation change.</v>

2031
01:34:06.390 --> 01:34:09.080
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're gaining 18,000</v>

2032
01:34:09.370 --> 01:34:10.203
<v Speaker 4>and you're losing 21 overall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The course goes from squaw valley down </v>

2033
01:34:12.821 --> 01:34:13.654
<v Speaker 4>to Auburn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in the course of that it's up and </v>

2034
01:34:15.581 --> 01:34:16.121
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>up and down,</v>

2035
01:34:16.121 --> 01:34:16.954
<v Speaker 4>up and down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you're gaining 18 or over the </v>

2036
01:34:18.731 --> 01:34:22.260
<v Speaker 4>course of 100 miles and losing 21 wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or something like that.</v>

2037
01:34:22.261 --> 01:34:23.094
<v Speaker 4>It's 41,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>different and even running down still </v>

2038
01:34:25.390 --> 01:34:28.810
<v Speaker 4>difficult because you're decelerating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to stop your momentum.</v>

2039
01:34:28.950 --> 01:34:31.600
<v Speaker 4>So for us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a 70 plus year old guy to do that,</v>

2040
01:34:31.690 --> 01:34:32.523
<v Speaker 4>that's one thing about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you start at that race and they </v>

2041
01:34:34.721 --> 01:34:37.650
<v Speaker 4>always say once you get into the canyon </v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

2042
01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:40.090
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't bomb downhill too fast,</v>

2043
01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:43.000
<v Speaker 4>which is sort of early in the race as </v>
<v Speaker 4>before mile 50.</v>

2044
01:34:43.570 --> 01:34:46.330
<v Speaker 4>But if you bombed down hill too fast in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the canyons,</v>

2045
01:34:46.510 --> 01:34:49.300
<v Speaker 4>you'll blow your quads out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You won't be finishing the race.</v>

2046
01:34:49.970 --> 01:34:51.760
<v Speaker 4>So you pound your quads too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you got to,</v>

2047
01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:53.970
<v Speaker 4>even though you could go fast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>downhill,</v>

2048
01:34:54.130 --> 01:34:56.470
<v Speaker 4>you gotta take it easy because you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>got to preserve your quads.</v>

2049
01:34:56.650 --> 01:34:58.040
<v Speaker 4>So your quads are getting</v>

2050
01:34:58.040 --> 01:34:59.840
<v Speaker 1>used and the decelerating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2051
01:35:00.250 --> 01:35:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2052
01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:02.330
<v Speaker 1>they're getting pounded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2053
01:35:02.690 --> 01:35:04.570
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and where we are now.</v>

2054
01:35:04.571 --> 01:35:06.260
<v Speaker 1>And candace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bert with her,</v>

2055
01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:08.330
<v Speaker 1>she has um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing is.</v>

2056

2072
01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:49.640

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you don't see anything but white,</v>

2079
01:36:01.850 --> 01:36:04.430
<v Speaker 1>at least Moab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at epic landscape.</v>

2080
01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:05.820
<v Speaker 1>It's a challenge though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2081
01:36:05.850 --> 01:36:07.370
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

2082
01:36:08.330 --> 01:36:09.740
<v Speaker 1>a new challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2086
01:36:19.191 --> 01:36:22.250
<v Speaker 1>there was 74.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this year there's over 100.</v>

2087
01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:25.400
<v Speaker 1>And how many people finish when I did </v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

2088
01:36:25.401 --> 01:36:27.190
<v Speaker 1>Forty seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finished imodium.</v>

2089
01:36:27.220 --> 01:36:27.640
<v Speaker 1>Press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2090
01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Most of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you sign up for $200,</v>

2091
01:36:30.290 --> 01:36:31.640
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you're doing that on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whim.</v>

2092
01:36:32.270 --> 01:36:33.103
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're prepared a 100 mile on a whim </v>

2093
01:36:34.670 --> 01:36:35.390
<v Speaker 1>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2094
01:36:35.390 --> 01:36:36.590
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was terrible.</v>

2095
01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:37.553
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the idea that you could do a 100 </v>

2096
01:36:39.471 --> 01:36:43.280
<v Speaker 1>mile race on a whim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the most painful pain.</v>

2097
01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:46.640
<v Speaker 1>Painful pain is most painful pain I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever felt.</v>

2098
01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:50.030
<v Speaker 1>Was that why you started going to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>marathon a day afterwards?</v>

2099
01:36:50.090 --> 01:36:52.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I just knew that was in a,</v>

2100
01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:55.400
<v Speaker 1>that was the ledger Brisa 24 hour run </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was in June.</v>

2101
01:36:55.401 --> 01:36:56.151
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2102
01:36:56.151 --> 01:36:58.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm behind on my schedule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on my training.</v>

2103
01:36:58.851 --> 01:37:02.120
<v Speaker 1>I gotta just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta grind out a big one so I'm like,</v>

2104
01:37:02.121 --> 01:37:02.954
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you decided to grind out a big one </v>

2105
01:37:04.401 --> 01:37:07.910
<v Speaker 1>just to boost your training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to get you over the hump myself up.</v>

2106
01:37:07.970 --> 01:37:08.840
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2107
01:37:08.950 --> 01:37:10.130
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does that benefit you?</v>

2108
01:37:11.540 --> 01:37:13.850
<v Speaker 1>Just mentally?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or does it do it physically as well?</v>

2109
01:37:13.860 --> 01:37:16.250
<v Speaker 1>He asked me questions like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It probably doesn't,</v>

2110
01:37:16.610 --> 01:37:17.443
<v Speaker 1>but in the time were you thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this'll get me over the hump and it'll </v>

2111
01:37:21.741 --> 01:37:24.590
<v Speaker 1>get in shape just like Derek's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it?</v>

2112
01:37:24.620 --> 01:37:26.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During that race I was turning into,</v>

2113
01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:27.793
<v Speaker 1>remember I said I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people are weak pussies you became </v>

2114
01:37:29.811 --> 01:37:33.280
<v Speaker 1>a week because he definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So uh,</v>

2115
01:37:33.350 --> 01:37:37.340
<v Speaker 1>I was in that race and a feeling </v>
<v Speaker 1>miserable.</v>

2116
01:37:37.341 --> 01:37:38.780
<v Speaker 1>So I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2117
01:37:38.781 --> 01:37:40.700
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2118
01:37:40.701 --> 01:37:43.430
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'll quit at 30 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty miles is still good run,</v>

2119
01:37:43.610 --> 01:37:46.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't run 30 miles by June,</v>

2120
01:37:46.281 --> 01:37:47.880
<v Speaker 1>so I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2121
01:37:47.881 --> 01:37:48.714
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to say this is just a </v>

2122
01:37:49.491 --> 01:37:50.324
<v Speaker 1>training day tomorrow I'll go home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest up and maybe I'll do another long </v>

2123
01:37:53.901 --> 01:37:56.160
<v Speaker 1>run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that will be good back back because</v>

2124
01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:58.380
<v Speaker 4>that's what you need for those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for those.</v>

2125
01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:03.030
<v Speaker 4>The 200 mile races is Moshe running is </v>
<v Speaker 4>your beat to shit.</v>

2126
01:38:03.150 --> 01:38:04.590
<v Speaker 4>So I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2127
01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:05.453
<v Speaker 4>you gotta be able to push through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the back to back training days are </v>

2128
01:38:07.111 --> 01:38:07.944
<v Speaker 4>key.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So at 30 miles I was about at six hours </v>

2129
01:38:11.850 --> 01:38:15.180
<v Speaker 4>and I'm like God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe I feel,</v>

2130
01:38:15.181 --> 01:38:20.181
<v Speaker 4>I feel awful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but maybe I'll quit at 50 so I got to 50</v>

2131
01:38:21.631 --> 01:38:23.580
<v Speaker 4>miles and I'm like God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2132
01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:24.593
<v Speaker 4>maybe I'll run 12 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So at 12 hours as at 61 miles and a is </v>

2133
01:38:29.311 --> 01:38:31.350
<v Speaker 4>at night and night the race starts at </v>
<v Speaker 4>nine in the morning.</v>

2134
01:38:31.710 --> 01:38:35.700
<v Speaker 4>Nine at night I was at 61 miles at </v>
<v Speaker 4>feeling awful.</v>

2135
01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:36.593
<v Speaker 4>But I'm like Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be such a pussy if I quit </v>

2136
01:38:40.050 --> 01:38:40.883
<v Speaker 4>because my not because there's anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong with running a 12 hour race in </v>

2137
01:38:44.251 --> 01:38:45.870
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] 61 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's awesome.</v>

2138
01:38:45.870 --> 01:38:46.770
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

2139
01:38:47.340 --> 01:38:48.900
<v Speaker 4>that's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Super hard.</v>

2140
01:38:49.470 --> 01:38:51.810
<v Speaker 4>But for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my goal was 24 hours.</v>

2141
01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:56.340
<v Speaker 4>I signed up for the 24 hour race,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so 12 hours isn't 24.</v>

2142
01:38:56.610 --> 01:38:57.630
<v Speaker 4>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2143
01:38:58.950 --> 01:38:59.783
<v Speaker 4>I got 12 hours to get 39 miles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just did 61 miles in 12 hours so I </v>

2144
01:39:05.041 --> 01:39:07.860
<v Speaker 4>could just milk it out and still get my </v>
<v Speaker 4>hundred,</v>

2145
01:39:08.100 --> 01:39:09.930
<v Speaker 4>which was my goal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>24 hours,</v>

2146
01:39:09.931 --> 01:39:11.430
<v Speaker 4>100 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I thought,</v>

2147
01:39:11.431 --> 01:39:15.120
<v Speaker 4>well I got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got 12 hours to get 39 miles and uh,</v>

2148
01:39:15.270 --> 01:39:19.410
<v Speaker 4>it was the worst 12 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>

2149
01:39:19.411 --> 01:39:21.720
<v Speaker 4>I barely got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was.</v>

2150
01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:26.730
<v Speaker 4>So I did 61 and 12 and then it took me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>took me 12 to get the 39,</v>

2151
01:39:26.731 --> 01:39:29.070
<v Speaker 4>but I got 100 miles done and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2152
01:39:29.130 --> 01:39:30.660
<v Speaker 4>wasn't trained up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't ready,</v>

2153
01:39:30.661 --> 01:39:31.494
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had all these reasons and I was </v>

2154
01:39:33.391 --> 01:39:34.201
<v Speaker 4>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was running,</v>

2155
01:39:34.201 --> 01:39:36.300
<v Speaker 4>thinking of all these excuses I could </v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

2156
01:39:36.301 --> 01:39:40.230
<v Speaker 4>and I can say that I cramped up and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

2157
01:39:40.231 --> 01:39:42.840
<v Speaker 4>this is a good example of why you </v>
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't,</v>

2158
01:39:44.570 --> 01:39:45.660
<v Speaker 4>what not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2159
01:39:45.661 --> 01:39:48.420
<v Speaker 4>push your body passes limit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I could just be all,</v>

2160
01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:53.070
<v Speaker 4>get all these Kudos for being smart and </v>
<v Speaker 4>in everybody just say it's okay,</v>

2161
01:39:53.071 --> 01:39:54.840
<v Speaker 4>you did great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I would know,</v>

2162
01:39:55.470 --> 01:39:56.303
<v Speaker 4>I would know that I pushed out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I kept going and didn't you run 13 </v>

2163
01:39:59.341 --> 01:40:00.990
<v Speaker 4>miles the next day?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2164
01:40:03.690 --> 01:40:05.380
<v Speaker 4>because you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2165
01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:07.910
<v Speaker 4>so my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my whole thing was see this</v>

2166
01:40:07.970 --> 01:40:08.803
<v Speaker 3>going 200 mile distance and an ultra </v>
<v Speaker 3>marathon may be healthier than stopping </v>

2167
01:40:12.201 --> 01:40:13.880
<v Speaker 3>at $100.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

2168
01:40:13.881 --> 01:40:15.410
<v Speaker 3>How does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scroll up.</v>

2169
01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:18.440
<v Speaker 3>The pacing is different for the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that studied that.</v>

2170
01:40:18.441 --> 01:40:20.990
<v Speaker 3>We're going just 100 that were going </v>
<v Speaker 3>slower,</v>

2171
01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:25.460
<v Speaker 3>which led to lots of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting scroll.</v>

2172
01:40:26.060 --> 01:40:28.550
<v Speaker 3>I could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason 200 milers,</v>

2173
01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:29.433
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't as fatigued as the hundred mile </v>

2174
01:40:30.561 --> 01:40:34.370
<v Speaker 3>group was due to pacing the tour desk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yawns how do you say that?</v>

2175
01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:35.383
<v Speaker 3>G E a n t s toward dig.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gaulle's runner's average three point </v>

2176
01:40:40.701 --> 01:40:42.380
<v Speaker 3>four miles per hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>During the course.</v>

2177
01:40:42.381 --> 01:40:47.180
<v Speaker 3>While the 100 mile runners took a faster</v>
<v Speaker 3>four point five miles per hour pace.</v>

2178
01:40:47.450 --> 01:40:51.560
<v Speaker 3>Rich Roll was saying that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he runs ultra marathons,</v>

2179
01:40:51.561 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 3>like when he was training that one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>keys was never</v>

2180
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:56.530
<v Speaker 1>get his heart rate over 140 beats per </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute.</v>

2181
01:40:56.890 --> 01:40:57.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2182
01:40:57.611 --> 01:40:58.444
<v Speaker 1>I wish I was smart because if I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>smart I wouldn't go out because like </v>

2183
01:41:02.231 --> 01:41:03.130
<v Speaker 1>when big foot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2184
01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:04.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to break the course record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2185
01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:06.830
<v Speaker 1>So was killing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was up.</v>

2186
01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:09.670
<v Speaker 1>I was ahead by hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2187
01:41:09.990 --> 01:41:10.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hours.</v>

2188
01:41:10.930 --> 01:41:12.820
<v Speaker 1>But you fucked up at that one place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't have any water.</v>

2189
01:41:12.821 --> 01:41:13.450
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2190
01:41:13.450 --> 01:41:16.870
<v Speaker 1>So died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I could go out and be smart,</v>

2191
01:41:17.950 --> 01:41:20.700
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm going to try to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think he can win this mob?</v>

2192
01:41:21.620 --> 01:41:22.880
<v Speaker 4>I Dunno know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I doubt it.</v>

2193
01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:25.410
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2194
01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:28.880
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why can't you?</v>

2195
01:41:29.690 --> 01:41:33.610
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well there's freaks out there.</v>

2196
01:41:33.770 --> 01:41:36.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean like Cameron Hanes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2197
01:41:36.890 --> 01:41:39.090
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you're a freak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2198
01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:40.880
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think uh,</v>

2199
01:41:40.910 --> 01:41:43.280
<v Speaker 4>I can push.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm good at pain management,</v>

2200
01:41:43.390 --> 01:41:44.840
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or ignoring pain.</v>

2201
01:41:45.230 --> 01:41:46.063
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2202
01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:49.910
<v Speaker 4>I had a lot of confidence when I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing a marathon a day.</v>

2203
01:41:50.090 --> 01:41:52.040
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my confidence was bar.</v>

2204
01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:53.730
<v Speaker 4>I've never been able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2205
01:41:53.731 --> 01:41:54.590
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could've done it.</v>

2206
01:41:54.591 --> 01:41:57.420
<v Speaker 4>I just never did it because I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2207
01:41:57.880 --> 01:41:59.860
<v Speaker 1>but isn't season's basically over now </v>
<v Speaker 1>for you,</v>

2208
01:41:59.890 --> 01:42:02.950
<v Speaker 1>except for doing a little blacktail </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting Oregon.</v>

2209
01:42:03.370 --> 01:42:05.440
<v Speaker 1>So when will you ramp back up to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>marathon?</v>

2210
01:42:05.441 --> 01:42:06.274
<v Speaker 1>A day?</v>

2211
01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:07.953
<v Speaker 4>Well now it's a time of should I do it </v>
<v Speaker 4>or should I just just think my </v>

2212
01:42:13.721 --> 01:42:14.250
<v Speaker 4>training's</v>

2213
01:42:14.250 --> 01:42:15.083
<v Speaker 1>the bank and manage till the race </v>
<v Speaker 1>because now I could hammer too hard and </v>

2214
01:42:19.631 --> 01:42:20.680
<v Speaker 1>go into the race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fatigued.</v>

2215
01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:22.000
<v Speaker 1>What is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what day of the race?</v>

2216
01:42:22.330 --> 01:42:25.510
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the 13th of October.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does that four weeks.</v>

2217
01:42:25.540 --> 01:42:26.800
<v Speaker 1>Three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's today?</v>

2218
01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:28.240
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three weeks.</v>

2219
01:42:28.930 --> 01:42:30.940
<v Speaker 1>Twenty seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how will you know?</v>

2220
01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.580
<v Speaker 1>What's the right way to do and what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrong way to do it?</v>

2221
01:42:35.140 --> 01:42:36.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would you know?</v>

2222
01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:38.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't know.</v>

2223
01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:39.513
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was in their ways or people tell </v>

2224
01:42:42.371 --> 01:42:44.380
<v Speaker 1>whether or not they're overtrained they </v>
<v Speaker 1>monitor.</v>

2225
01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:45.850
<v Speaker 1>Here's what people say.</v>

2226
01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:46.953
<v Speaker 4>If you run a marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should not run another one for six </v>

2227
01:42:50.111 --> 01:42:53.920
<v Speaker 4>months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So should I listen to them?</v>

2228
01:42:56.130 --> 01:42:56.963
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's really no know because it's so </v>

2229
01:42:58.201 --> 01:43:00.300
<v Speaker 1>hard on your body and so on and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>

2230
01:43:00.301 --> 01:43:02.550
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how do you,</v>

2231
01:43:02.570 --> 01:43:05.430
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you built up to a marathon a day,</v>

2232
01:43:05.460 --> 01:43:06.900
<v Speaker 1>how long did it take you to build up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

2233
01:43:06.901 --> 01:43:09.240
<v Speaker 1>After the 100 mile race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was in June,</v>

2234
01:43:09.241 --> 01:43:10.170
<v Speaker 1>is that what you said?</v>
<v Speaker 1>June?</v>

2235
01:43:10.171 --> 01:43:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's not a lot of time.</v>

2236
01:43:11.671 --> 01:43:12.451
<v Speaker 1>July,</v>
<v Speaker 1>August.</v>

2237
01:43:12.451 --> 01:43:13.284
<v Speaker 1>We're in September.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're talking like during July and </v>

2238
01:43:14.911 --> 01:43:17.000
<v Speaker 1>August you managed to build yourself up </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a marathon.</v>

2239
01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:19.740
<v Speaker 1>And I did a under armour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a mayor,</v>

2240
01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:23.040
<v Speaker 1>an ultra at mount bachelor in July.</v>

2241
01:43:23.130 --> 01:43:23.963
<v Speaker 4>Well I didn't like July 20 something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was about a month after the 24 </v>

2242
01:43:30.171 --> 01:43:31.190
<v Speaker 4>hour race.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't take a day.</v>

2243
01:43:31.790 --> 01:43:32.623
<v Speaker 4>I think I took one day off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I ran every day from the 24 hour </v>

2244
01:43:36.891 --> 01:43:41.510
<v Speaker 4>trying to beat my body up and then I </v>
<v Speaker 4>went into that ultra and I ran that.</v>

2245
01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:44.720
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't got,</v>

2246
01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:47.750
<v Speaker 4>took the wrong course for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 4>miles.</v>

2247
01:43:47.751 --> 01:43:50.570
<v Speaker 4>So I didn't think I got seven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what I got,</v>

2248
01:43:50.630 --> 01:43:54.500
<v Speaker 4>but that was 100.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that was a 50 k,</v>

2249
01:43:54.590 --> 01:43:59.320
<v Speaker 4>so that was 31 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then um,</v>

2250
01:44:00.140 --> 01:44:03.920
<v Speaker 4>the next day I ran the south sister,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a,</v>

2251
01:44:04.730 --> 01:44:07.940
<v Speaker 4>it was 16 miles with 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>feet of gain,</v>

2252
01:44:07.941 --> 01:44:08.774
<v Speaker 4>so I got really good mountain back to </v>
<v Speaker 4>back days there with no break after the </v>

2253
01:44:12.711 --> 01:44:13.544
<v Speaker 4>24 hour and then went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then took a little break I think a day </v>

2254
01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:23.800
<v Speaker 4>and then started trying to get at really</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least a half marathon a day.</v>

2255
01:44:24.050 --> 01:44:28.400
<v Speaker 4>But then I went on a run I think of nine</v>
<v Speaker 4>days where I did a marathon every day.</v>

2256
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:29.623
<v Speaker 4>And so if that time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you had asked if I had a chance to </v>

2257
01:44:31.611 --> 01:44:33.530
<v Speaker 4>win my lab,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have said yeah,</v>

2258
01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:34.893
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because my confidence was amazing </v>

2259
01:44:36.650 --> 01:44:37.483
<v Speaker 4>because I've never been able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And maybe I'm not being realistic about </v>

2260
01:44:40.731 --> 01:44:42.220
<v Speaker 4>it because there could be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2261
01:44:42.260 --> 01:44:45.380
<v Speaker 4>Jim Walmsley show up who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows what he could run it in.</v>

2262
01:44:45.770 --> 01:44:48.440
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so maybe it's not realistic,</v>

2263
01:44:48.441 --> 01:44:50.960
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at that time I had confidence.</v>

2264
01:44:50.961 --> 01:44:54.230
<v Speaker 4>Now after not running that much and </v>
<v Speaker 4>being gone hunting,</v>

2265
01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:55.153
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2266
01:44:56.030 --> 01:44:59.960
<v Speaker 3>So when will you decide when or when we </v>
<v Speaker 3>decided like how you're going to train,</v>

2267
01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.480
<v Speaker 3>like you going to start running tomorrow</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you get back home.</v>

2268
01:45:02.510 --> 01:45:06.530
<v Speaker 3>I'll do a marathon tomorrow and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>once you do a marathon tomorrow I'll see</v>

2269
01:45:06.531 --> 01:45:09.800
<v Speaker 3>how I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in my body feels awesome right now.</v>

2270
01:45:10.010 --> 01:45:11.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're rested up.</v>

2271
01:45:11.450 --> 01:45:12.283
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel I feel as good as I felt in a </v>

2272
01:45:14.781 --> 01:45:16.880
<v Speaker 3>long time right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that was the idea though,</v>

2273
01:45:16.881 --> 01:45:19.070
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That you were going to train super hard.</v>

2274
01:45:19.071 --> 01:45:19.904
<v Speaker 3>Beat yourself up and then take a few </v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks off for hunting and he would </v>

2275
01:45:21.561 --> 01:45:22.970
<v Speaker 3>recover and recuperate.</v>

2276
01:45:23.070 --> 01:45:24.900
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Looked good on paper.</v>

2277
01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:25.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2278
01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:26.513
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2279
01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:28.133
<v Speaker 3>when you run that marathon tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to feel like a fucking </v>

2280
01:45:29.731 --> 01:45:33.510
<v Speaker 3>animal even better than before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I won't.</v>

2281
01:45:33.570 --> 01:45:34.590
<v Speaker 3>Invigorated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2282
01:45:34.650 --> 01:45:35.281
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's,</v>

2283
01:45:35.281 --> 01:45:38.490
<v Speaker 3>what the negative self doubt talked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm not,</v>

2284
01:45:38.510 --> 01:45:41.280
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just how it is sometimes.</v>

2285
01:45:41.550 --> 01:45:42.383
<v Speaker 3>Do you think there's any advantage to </v>
<v Speaker 3>your diet that you eat all this wild </v>

2286
01:45:45.331 --> 01:45:46.164
<v Speaker 3>game?</v>

2287
01:45:46.670 --> 01:45:47.503
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2288
01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:51.610
<v Speaker 3>There's gotta be like some sort of end </v>
<v Speaker 3>up with anything.</v>

2289
01:45:51.611 --> 01:45:55.600
<v Speaker 3>Do I can just say science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's,</v>

2290
01:45:56.710 --> 01:46:01.210
<v Speaker 3>it's obvious like I was cutting up some </v>
<v Speaker 3>meat and my wife was looking at it.</v>

2291
01:46:01.211 --> 01:46:03.250
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it almost looks like organ meat.</v>

2292
01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:04.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it's,</v>

2293
01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:05.640
<v Speaker 4>it's so rich.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2294
01:46:05.641 --> 01:46:10.140
<v Speaker 4>it's dark as dark and rich.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like if,</v>

2295
01:46:10.141 --> 01:46:10.974
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're not used to eating that type </v>

2296
01:46:13.651 --> 01:46:16.380
<v Speaker 4>of me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it can affect your stomach because it's,</v>

2297
01:46:16.410 --> 01:46:21.410
<v Speaker 4>it's so it's rich protein and so it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>definitely more.</v>

2298
01:46:24.270 --> 01:46:25.103
<v Speaker 4>I don't want that</v>

2299
01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:28.330
<v Speaker 3>more nutrient dense and I want to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>potent almost then,</v>

2300
01:46:28.331 --> 01:46:29.980
<v Speaker 3>right than like a steak you'd buy at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>store.</v>

2301
01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:31.840
<v Speaker 3>Like dolce always likes to use that </v>
<v Speaker 3>word,</v>

2302
01:46:31.870 --> 01:46:34.630
<v Speaker 3>nutrient dense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it's super smart.</v>

2303
01:46:34.820 --> 01:46:35.653
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you look at the protein per </v>

2304
01:46:38.171 --> 01:46:40.040
<v Speaker 3>ounce,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they do,</v>

2305
01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:41.500
<v Speaker 3>there's a chart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

2306
01:46:41.890 --> 01:46:43.090
<v Speaker 3>that they do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2307
01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:45.430
<v Speaker 3>they compare beef,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chicken,</v>

2308
01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.820
<v Speaker 3>salmon and elk and Moose and it's off </v>
<v Speaker 3>the charts.</v>

2309
01:46:48.850 --> 01:46:50.100
<v Speaker 3>It's double.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

2310
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:53.130
<v Speaker 1>you could get the same amount of protein</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you get in a 16 ounce steak,</v>

2311
01:46:53.131 --> 01:46:55.410
<v Speaker 1>I think in like an eight ounce piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>elk.</v>

2312
01:46:56.100 --> 01:46:59.040
<v Speaker 1>So you need less and it's more potent </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it just,</v>

2313
01:46:59.460 --> 01:47:01.420
<v Speaker 1>it just looks different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2314
01:47:01.450 --> 01:47:04.530
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've shown it to friends that have never</v>

2315
01:47:04.531 --> 01:47:09.030
<v Speaker 1>eaten out before the like Jesus because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just read it just,</v>

2316
01:47:09.390 --> 01:47:11.160
<v Speaker 1>just dense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2317
01:47:11.161 --> 01:47:14.100
<v Speaker 1>you're eating a super athlete and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it's like.</v>

2318
01:47:14.130 --> 01:47:14.963
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what I feel like I feel like </v>

2319
01:47:16.141 --> 01:47:17.640
<v Speaker 1>when I'm eating at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2320
01:47:17.790 --> 01:47:21.330
<v Speaker 1>those elk are amazing animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful,</v>

2321
01:47:21.331 --> 01:47:24.060
<v Speaker 1>strong endurance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2322
01:47:24.300 --> 01:47:25.133
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything I would like to be as far as </v>

2323
01:47:27.690 --> 01:47:31.890
<v Speaker 1>of taking on anything that happens and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2324
01:47:32.250 --> 01:47:33.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you eat it,</v>

2325
01:47:33.050 --> 01:47:33.883
<v Speaker 1>how could you not have confidence or </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel better by just think it's the best </v>

2326
01:47:37.051 --> 01:47:38.340
<v Speaker 1>food for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

2327
01:47:38.650 --> 01:47:40.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel fucking fantastic.</v>

2328
01:47:40.860 --> 01:47:44.190
<v Speaker 1>I feel better now at 50 than I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>felt like probably in my life.</v>

2329
01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:46.140
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel better at 50 than I did at 40.</v>

2330
01:47:46.530 --> 01:47:47.190
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2331
01:47:47.190 --> 01:47:48.023
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely just brought a lot of it is </v>

2332
01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:53.160
<v Speaker 1>eating really healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really running,</v>

2333
01:47:53.310 --> 01:47:55.040
<v Speaker 1>managing my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2334
01:47:55.260 --> 01:47:56.820
<v Speaker 1>my sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big one.</v>

2335
01:47:56.850 --> 01:47:57.683
<v Speaker 1>That's one that you don't do that very </v>
<v Speaker 1>good and you don't really get a lot of </v>

2336
01:47:59.470 --> 01:48:01.680
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that stupid job.</v>

2337
01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:06.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm supposed to be at work right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you get to Friday,</v>

2338
01:48:06.250 --> 01:48:07.083
<v Speaker 1>but you make more money outside your </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid job than you do on your stupid </v>

2339
01:48:09.271 --> 01:48:10.104
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

2340
01:48:12.550 --> 01:48:13.800
<v Speaker 1>Son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to manage.</v>

2341
01:48:13.801 --> 01:48:16.800
<v Speaker 1>You need to listen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2342
01:48:16.950 --> 01:48:20.130
<v Speaker 1>Every time we talk about this we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talk about it a lot.</v>

2343
01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:21.773
<v Speaker 1>You're the opposite of me in that regard</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm like captain cut ties and </v>

2344
01:48:26.581 --> 01:48:29.580
<v Speaker 1>burned the bridge and fucking throw </v>
<v Speaker 1>kerosene on the house.</v>

2345
01:48:29.610 --> 01:48:31.800
<v Speaker 1>Light on fire and drive away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woo.</v>

2346
01:48:31.870 --> 01:48:33.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're not.</v>

2347
01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:35.100
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Opposite.</v>

2348
01:48:35.610 --> 01:48:36.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>

2349
01:48:37.230 --> 01:48:38.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in part of it is,</v>

2350
01:48:38.581 --> 01:48:40.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never,</v>

2351
01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:41.153
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never felt special so I've always </v>

2352
01:48:42.931 --> 01:48:47.510
<v Speaker 1>feel like I should appreciate having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good job and uh,</v>

2353
01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:48.473
<v Speaker 1>I'm loyal to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to where I work and so I feel like all </v>

2354
01:48:52.261 --> 01:48:53.094
<v Speaker 1>this opportunity and these things that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>do and being on your show and all that </v>

2355
01:48:56.911 --> 01:48:58.240
<v Speaker 1>could go away tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

2356
01:48:58.241 --> 01:48:59.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I quit the job I'd be like,</v>

2357
01:48:59.790 --> 01:49:00.900
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew it.</v>

2358
01:49:00.930 --> 01:49:01.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fricking loser.</v>

2359
01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:02.753
<v Speaker 1>And I quit it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best job I've ever had in my entire </v>

2360
01:49:04.141 --> 01:49:06.390
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's an interesting way of looking</v>

2361
01:49:06.391 --> 01:49:08.610
<v Speaker 1>at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

2362
01:49:08.620 --> 01:49:13.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm part of your strength is the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can endure.</v>

2363
01:49:14.250 --> 01:49:15.083
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think you're in during this </v>

2364
01:49:18.031 --> 01:49:21.150
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I like being miserable,</v>

2365
01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:23.550
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not because I liked the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>at work.</v>

2366
01:49:24.090 --> 01:49:26.550
<v Speaker 1>Do you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you would like it more if you didn't</v>

2367
01:49:26.551 --> 01:49:27.900
<v Speaker 1>have to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2368
01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:30.000
<v Speaker 1>I would like just to check in with them </v>
<v Speaker 1>every once in a while.</v>

2369
01:49:30.001 --> 01:49:31.020
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how's everybody?</v>

2370
01:49:31.021 --> 01:49:31.854
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's,</v>

2371
01:49:32.060 --> 01:49:34.650
<v Speaker 1>how's that place where I used to work </v>
<v Speaker 1>for my whole life?</v>

2372
01:49:35.820 --> 01:49:36.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2373
01:49:36.391 --> 01:49:37.440
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I missed.</v>

2374
01:49:37.441 --> 01:49:40.100
<v Speaker 1>I miss the people when I'm not there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2375
01:49:40.290 --> 01:49:43.290
<v Speaker 1>I miss problem solving and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2376
01:49:43.291 --> 01:49:44.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>helping people,</v>

2377
01:49:44.761 --> 01:49:45.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2378
01:49:46.410 --> 01:49:48.070
<v Speaker 1>achieve goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

2379
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.903
<v Speaker 3>I like being there for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been thinking about this a lot and </v>

2380
01:49:50.951 --> 01:49:53.320
<v Speaker 3>I've been trying to figure out what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a solution is,</v>

2381
01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:57.040
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe we could talk to a hoyt about this</v>

2382
01:49:57.070 --> 01:49:58.720
<v Speaker 3>or some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2383
01:49:59.470 --> 01:50:01.840
<v Speaker 3>some company about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you under armour,</v>

2384
01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:03.273
<v Speaker 3>but the idea of putting together like </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost like camps where people could </v>

2385
01:50:09.431 --> 01:50:13.150
<v Speaker 3>learn archery and maybe you could give </v>
<v Speaker 3>seminars.</v>

2386
01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:15.790
<v Speaker 3>Guys like Dudley can show some archery </v>
<v Speaker 3>techniques.</v>

2387
01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:20.080
<v Speaker 3>Guys like Remy Warren can talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>things and putting together these almost</v>

2388
01:50:20.081 --> 01:50:22.590
<v Speaker 3>like introductory camps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2389
01:50:22.790 --> 01:50:24.550
<v Speaker 3>where people don't know where to start </v>
<v Speaker 3>or where to start.</v>

2390
01:50:24.551 --> 01:50:26.920
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know where to start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it wasn't for Steve Rinella,</v>

2391
01:50:27.370 --> 01:50:28.900
<v Speaker 3>I would've never got to start in </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting.</v>

2392
01:50:28.980 --> 01:50:31.380
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would've never got started behind.</v>

2393
01:50:31.870 --> 01:50:32.703
<v Speaker 3>It's just sometimes you need someone and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not a lot of resources out </v>

2394
01:50:35.681 --> 01:50:36.514
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of people that are </v>

2395
01:50:36.671 --> 01:50:37.140
<v Speaker 3>listening.</v>

2396
01:50:37.140 --> 01:50:39.380
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that they're </v>

<v Speaker 3>You could go get them.</v>

2402
01:50:52.330 --> 01:50:53.980
<v Speaker 3>They don't cost that much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Go,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you pay your license fee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he buy a tag and you can go out into the</v>

2404
01:50:57.911 --> 01:50:58.744
<v Speaker 3>wilderness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just need a tent and a backpack and </v>

2405
01:51:00.311 --> 01:51:03.520
<v Speaker 3>a bow and Arrow and guts and just go out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and you could.</v>

2406

<v Speaker 3>You could handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

2407
01:51:04.810 --> 01:51:05.643
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of opportunity like that </v>

2408
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:07.863
<v Speaker 3>in this country is amazing for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the few countries in the </v>

2409
01:51:10.001 --> 01:51:10.834
<v Speaker 3>world where we have literally millions </v>
<v Speaker 3>of acres of public land that are all </v>

2410
01:51:13.631 --> 01:51:14.464
<v Speaker 3>yours and mine and I was wearing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>back country hunters and anglers tee </v>

2411
01:51:17.441 --> 01:51:19.470
<v Speaker 3>shirt yesterday that says public land </v>
<v Speaker 3>owner.</v>

2412
01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:22.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all public land owners and it's,</v>

2413
01:51:22.580 --> 01:51:23.680
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very,</v>

2414
01:51:23.681 --> 01:51:27.940
<v Speaker 3>very important thing to support and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is an amazing resource.</v>

2415
01:51:27.941 --> 01:51:29.650
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like where we're at.</v>

2416
01:51:29.651 --> 01:51:32.500
<v Speaker 3>Utah is super rare and not a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people get to go there,</v>

2417
01:51:32.501 --> 01:51:34.450
<v Speaker 3>but guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could go to Idaho,</v>

2418
01:51:34.510 --> 01:51:35.343
<v Speaker 3>Idaho.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can go into the back country in </v>

2419
01:51:37.481 --> 01:51:40.780
<v Speaker 3>Idaho and get amazing public land </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting.</v>

2420
01:51:40.810 --> 01:51:45.580
<v Speaker 3>If you're willing to hike in and go deep</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you go to google earth and you could</v>

2421
01:51:45.581 --> 01:51:46.414
<v Speaker 3>go in and look at all these basins and </v>
<v Speaker 3>mountains and you could go online and </v>

2422
01:51:50.021 --> 01:51:53.470
<v Speaker 3>ask people and there's ways to move </v>
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>

2423
01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:54.333
<v Speaker 3>There's ways to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but getting started is insanely </v>

2424
01:51:57.101 --> 01:51:57.934
<v Speaker 3>difficult and I've been thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this that maybe we could do something </v>

2425
01:52:02.110 --> 01:52:02.441
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2426
01:52:02.441 --> 01:52:05.230
<v Speaker 3>how they have that total archery </v>
<v Speaker 3>challenge that they did in Utah.</v>

2427
01:52:05.290 --> 01:52:06.880
<v Speaker 3>What were there I was is awesome.</v>

2428
01:52:06.910 --> 01:52:07.743
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2429
01:52:07.750 --> 01:52:08.583
<v Speaker 3>So maybe there's like a gathering that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we could put together like maybe once a </v>

2430
01:52:13.300 --> 01:52:14.980
<v Speaker 3>year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe during the off season,</v>

2431
01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:19.390
<v Speaker 3>just once a year where people can get </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe fitted for a bow.</v>

2432
01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:23.470
<v Speaker 3>You sign up for this in advance and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's a couple day thing,</v>

2433
01:52:23.490 --> 01:52:28.490
<v Speaker 3>like maybe one or two days where you go </v>
<v Speaker 3>through an introductory course of,</v>

2434
01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:29.513
<v Speaker 3>of archery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding it and then maybe someone </v>

2435
01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:37.090
<v Speaker 3>can talk about shot placement and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone else like someone who does a lot</v>

2436
01:52:37.091 --> 01:52:37.924
<v Speaker 3>of soul hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like remy or maybe even Adam can talk </v>

2437
01:52:40.211 --> 01:52:41.044
<v Speaker 3>about like woodsmanship and things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can learn and here's some books you </v>

<v Speaker 4>awesome.</v>

2447

<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've done gatherings,</v>

2448
01:53:09.260 --> 01:53:11.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wayne at the Iraq,</v>

2449
01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:12.330
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we used to do this,</v>

2450
01:53:12.331 --> 01:53:13.164
<v Speaker 4>bell hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember what we used to call </v>

2451
01:53:14.551 --> 01:53:15.384
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but six or 700 people would show up at </v>

2452
01:53:17.071 --> 01:53:18.690
<v Speaker 4>the sale rack in the parking lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>big tent.</v>

2453
01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:20.033
<v Speaker 4>And we do things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We could do it out where I practice out </v>

2454
01:53:22.381 --> 01:53:23.910
<v Speaker 4>of his property,</v>

01:53:27.391 --> 01:53:29.190
<v Speaker 4>it would just be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be amazing.</v>

2457
01:53:29.250 --> 01:53:30.083
<v Speaker 4>Why don't we do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reason I know that there's so much </v>

2458
01:53:33.301 --> 01:53:34.134
<v Speaker 4>interest in Pat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my book back country Bolony and I wrote </v>

2459
01:53:36.601 --> 01:53:41.601
<v Speaker 4>in 2006 cases of that go out every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2460
01:53:41.611 --> 01:53:46.020
<v Speaker 4>before I left on this hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I sat at my kitchen table and sign books</v>

2461
01:53:46.230 --> 01:53:47.280
<v Speaker 4>for on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2462
01:53:47.281 --> 01:53:50.280
<v Speaker 4>cases of books because those are all </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be gone when I get home.</v>

2463
01:53:50.880 --> 01:53:53.760
<v Speaker 4>Do you have a time machine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a time machine?</v>

2464
01:53:54.570 --> 01:53:56.100
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where do you get the time?</v>

2465
01:53:57.230 --> 01:53:58.063
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand how the fuck you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>time to run a marathon and then signed </v>

2466
01:54:00.741 --> 01:54:05.210
<v Speaker 3>books and then practice bowhunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do 100 reps and fucking this.</v>

2467
01:54:05.211 --> 01:54:06.044
<v Speaker 3>And I've done that with your family than</v>
<v Speaker 3>dinner and go to sleep and then work a </v>

2468
01:54:08.931 --> 01:54:10.220
<v Speaker 3>full time job and then</v>

2469
01:54:11.470 --> 01:54:12.840
<v Speaker 4>he is tough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

2470
01:54:12.900 --> 01:54:16.860
<v Speaker 4>but that's how I know that um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's so much interest in that is that</v>

2471
01:54:16.861 --> 01:54:18.390
<v Speaker 4>book is,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm a good example of people living that</v>

2476
01:54:35.371 --> 01:54:36.720
<v Speaker 4>dream.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy at work,</v>

2477
01:54:36.900 --> 01:54:37.733
<v Speaker 4>two guys at my work,</v>

2481
01:54:48.301 --> 01:54:49.134
<v Speaker 4>back country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their public land is a pretty easy tag </v>

2482
01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:52.230
<v Speaker 4>draw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can get a,</v>

2483
01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:54.970
<v Speaker 4>you put in for the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the premium tag.</v>

2484
01:54:54.971 --> 01:54:55.804
<v Speaker 4>It costs a little more to put in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the odds of getting it or you can </v>

2485
01:54:58.891 --> 01:55:01.200
<v Speaker 4>get it on.</v>

2535
01:56:59.521 --> 01:57:00.354
<v Speaker 1>the best places in the world where you </v>

<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

2538
01:57:05.940 --> 01:57:08.760
<v Speaker 1>I told you when I went there last summer</v>

2546
01:57:22.170 --> 01:57:25.200
<v Speaker 1>just looking out the window at a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours just hanging out on this field.</v>

2547
01:57:25.490 --> 01:57:26.970
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2548
01:57:27.100 --> 01:57:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2549
01:57:28.590 --> 01:57:29.320
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2550
01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:30.180
<v Speaker 1>Andy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

2551
01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:31.970
<v Speaker 1>wasn't he seal for 17 years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2552

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so just savage stud.</v>

2553
01:57:34.380 --> 01:57:36.990
<v Speaker 1>Just a great guy too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2554
01:57:37.330 --> 01:57:38.163
<v Speaker 1>just got a great mind for success and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is why he became obsessed with bow </v>

2555
01:57:43.021 --> 01:57:44.280
<v Speaker 1>hunting as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like he,</v>

2556
01:57:44.310 --> 01:57:49.020
<v Speaker 1>he recognized the things that we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about and he decided to start it</v>

2557
01:57:49.380 --> 01:57:50.213
<v Speaker 1>to start the process and see what it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like and then immediately became </v>

2558
01:57:52.741 --> 01:57:53.600
<v Speaker 1>obsessed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2559
01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:57.840
<v Speaker 1>And then as we talked about also hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2560
01:57:57.841 --> 01:57:58.680
<v Speaker 1>it's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2561
01:57:58.681 --> 01:57:59.670
<v Speaker 1>He had a hard time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2562
01:57:59.810 --> 01:58:02.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean he had some good success when </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dudley was coaching him.</v>

2563
01:58:02.790 --> 01:58:03.623
<v Speaker 1>Is that his place there to get that many</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have asked why we moved to </v>

2564
01:58:07.291 --> 01:58:08.640
<v Speaker 1>Montana and the other questions.</v>

2565
01:58:08.730 --> 01:58:10.380
<v Speaker 1>The only regret is not making the move </v>
<v Speaker 1>sooner.</v>

2566
01:58:10.680 --> 01:58:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that view.</v>

2567
01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:13.260
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

2568
01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:15.210
<v Speaker 1>Alex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just got his truck parked there and</v>

2569
01:58:15.420 --> 01:58:17.250
<v Speaker 1>saw some amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing view.</v>

2570
01:58:17.460 --> 01:58:18.293
<v Speaker 1>He said something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I saw common lake kind of looks </v>

2571
01:58:20.671 --> 01:58:24.330
<v Speaker 1>like it has a yard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No fucking Amen.</v>

2572
01:58:24.750 --> 01:58:25.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>

2573
01:58:25.891 --> 01:58:27.810
<v Speaker 1>I think he said something about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2574
01:58:28.210 --> 01:58:30.530
<v Speaker 1>and maybe it was on that queered hot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that other posts there.</v>

2575
01:58:30.531 --> 01:58:31.980
<v Speaker 1>The second post.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2576
01:58:32.070 --> 01:58:33.780
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe on his last shot,</v>

2577
01:58:33.781 --> 01:58:38.781
<v Speaker 1>he would have been better off throwing </v>
<v Speaker 1>his bow one week a to two in one week of</v>

2578
01:58:40.021 --> 01:58:42.190
<v Speaker 1>choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to take in talking about failure</v>

2579
01:58:42.190 --> 01:58:43.023
<v Speaker 3>in episode 13,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had one of the best weeks I've ever </v>

2580
01:58:44.591 --> 01:58:46.240
<v Speaker 3>had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have in a long time.</v>

2581
01:58:46.930 --> 01:58:49.990
<v Speaker 3>My mind kept drifting back to motivation</v>
<v Speaker 3>and purpose,</v>

2582
01:58:49.991 --> 01:58:52.570
<v Speaker 3>which my opinion is the opposite side of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the coin.</v>

2583
01:58:52.571 --> 01:58:53.404
<v Speaker 3>That failure sits on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hopefully something in it clicks for </v>

2584
01:58:55.871 --> 01:58:57.070
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2608
02:00:00.590 --> 02:00:01.423

2611
02:00:07.721 --> 02:00:10.600
<v Speaker 3>wake up call that even though he's John </v>

<v Speaker 3>motherfucker.</v>

2616
02:00:20.890 --> 02:00:23.710
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean you have to have 100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent dedication,</v>

2617
02:00:23.860 --> 02:00:25.990

<v Speaker 3>kind of,</v>

2620
02:00:33.670 --> 02:00:34.503
<v Speaker 3>it was exhausting for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there was times it can be kind of </v>

2621
02:00:36.941 --> 02:00:41.440
<v Speaker 3>frustrating where you're on an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I didn't feel frustrated.</v>

2622
02:00:41.441 --> 02:00:45.340
<v Speaker 3>Like I wanted to quit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt frustrated like I wanted to press</v>

2623
02:00:45.341 --> 02:00:48.070
<v Speaker 3>on and I wanted to get successful </v>
<v Speaker 3>income.</v>

2624

<v Speaker 3>Being friends with guys like you guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>like remy,</v>

2625
02:00:51.940 --> 02:00:54.940
<v Speaker 3>Adam Green Tree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just knowing these people that have done</v>

2626
02:00:54.941 --> 02:00:58.270
<v Speaker 3>all this and gone through all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>already,</v>

2627
02:00:58.850 --> 02:01:01.300
<v Speaker 3>just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also for people that are listening,</v>

2628
02:01:01.480 --> 02:01:02.313
<v Speaker 3>having podcasts where people like you or</v>
<v Speaker 3>like remy or Steven Rinella can talk </v>

2629
02:01:08.621 --> 02:01:11.460
<v Speaker 3>about the struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2630
02:01:11.590 --> 02:01:13.030
<v Speaker 3>It's so important,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2631
02:01:13.130 --> 02:01:16.270
<v Speaker 3>Because what gets attention is this </v>
<v Speaker 3>success.</v>

2632
02:01:16.330 --> 02:01:17.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you watch a TV show,</v>

2633
02:01:17.711 --> 02:01:20.350
<v Speaker 3>what do you see guys shooting animals so</v>
<v Speaker 3>easy.</v>

2634
02:01:20.710 --> 02:01:21.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does.</v>

2635
02:01:21.490 --> 02:01:23.210
<v Speaker 3>Because you get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get a TV shows,</v>

2636
02:01:23.230 --> 02:01:24.063
<v Speaker 3>21 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got some sponsors you've got to </v>

2637
02:01:25.511 --> 02:01:26.344
<v Speaker 3>mention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get a few minutes of hunting and </v>

2638
02:01:27.970 --> 02:01:28.803
<v Speaker 3>I'll hear they killed something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the things that I'm </v>

2639
02:01:30.311 --> 02:01:33.220
<v Speaker 3>worried about with these films because </v>
<v Speaker 3>these films are brilliant.</v>

2640
02:01:33.310 --> 02:01:36.160
<v Speaker 3>Like your film,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that time film that under armour made.</v>

2641
02:01:36.370 --> 02:01:38.830
<v Speaker 3>They're brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But man,</v>

2642
02:01:38.831 --> 02:01:41.090
<v Speaker 3>it seems like everything just kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened in that.</v>

2643
02:01:41.150 --> 02:01:43.190
<v Speaker 3>Like all of a sudden there's the elk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You passed up,</v>

2644
02:01:43.191 --> 02:01:44.270
<v Speaker 3>you were at full job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>

2645
02:01:44.330 --> 02:01:46.520
<v Speaker 3>not that one too young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's a perfect one.</v>

2646
02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:49.100
<v Speaker 3>Perfect shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's down in seconds.</v>

2647
02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:51.140
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's happy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not.</v>

2648
02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:52.393
<v Speaker 3>That's not the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing is the hours and hours and </v>

2649
02:01:56.060 --> 02:02:00.200
<v Speaker 3>hours of hiking and the disappointment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fucking wind goddess,</v>

2650
02:02:00.330 --> 02:02:01.163
<v Speaker 3>goddammit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we were in on this bowl and the </v>

2651
02:02:02.511 --> 02:02:05.750
<v Speaker 3>wind shifted and the cows go milk the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cows.</v>

2652
02:02:05.780 --> 02:02:09.050
<v Speaker 3>Bark bark for people don't know a cow </v>
<v Speaker 3>elk.</v>

2653
02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:13.610
<v Speaker 3>When they hear things or smell things </v>
<v Speaker 3>and see things and they know something's</v>

2654
02:02:13.611 --> 02:02:14.444
<v Speaker 3>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go</v>

2655
02:02:15.050 --> 02:02:20.050
<v Speaker 4>and it reverberates through the woods </v>
<v Speaker 4>and everybody knows what that sound is.</v>

2656
02:02:20.421 --> 02:02:21.254
<v Speaker 4>Sucks of fat Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody went when a cow wouldn't just </v>

2657
02:02:24.471 --> 02:02:27.980
<v Speaker 4>one cow something or smell something </v>
<v Speaker 4>barks.</v>

2658
02:02:28.130 --> 02:02:29.510
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2659
02:02:29.620 --> 02:02:31.430
<v Speaker 4>I mean that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's over.</v>

2660
02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:32.470
<v Speaker 4>There was a time,</v>

2661
02:02:32.690 --> 02:02:36.570
<v Speaker 3>Jamison and Colton and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before I killed that bull.</v>

2662
02:02:36.690 --> 02:02:40.320
<v Speaker 3>We were standing there dead still for </v>
<v Speaker 3>five minutes.</v>

2663
02:02:40.321 --> 02:02:43.710
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cows are just staring at us just staring</v>

2664
02:02:44.070 --> 02:02:46.320
<v Speaker 3>and you're not moving like your feet are</v>
<v Speaker 3>going numb.</v>

2665
02:02:46.321 --> 02:02:49.590
<v Speaker 3>Your knee hurts because you're kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like leaning on the side of a hill.</v>

2666
02:02:49.980 --> 02:02:50.813
<v Speaker 3>You can't move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just get to stay and they're just </v>

2667
02:02:52.771 --> 02:02:55.440
<v Speaker 3>looking right at you because for them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2668
02:02:55.441 --> 02:02:56.460
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a pursuit.</v>

2669
02:02:56.461 --> 02:02:57.560
<v Speaker 3>It's a discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2670
02:02:57.561 --> 02:02:58.231
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

2671
02:02:58.231 --> 02:03:01.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's exhilarating and intense.</v>

2672
02:03:01.081 --> 02:03:03.110
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It says that I'm attracted to it.</v>

2673
02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:07.530
<v Speaker 3>For them it's life and death and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have a language.</v>

2674
02:03:07.531 --> 02:03:10.920
<v Speaker 3>They don't have a brain that processes </v>
<v Speaker 3>all these variables.</v>

2675
02:03:11.070 --> 02:03:13.470
<v Speaker 3>They just know that's fucking danger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2676
02:03:13.471 --> 02:03:14.750
<v Speaker 3>It might be dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not.</v>

2677
02:03:14.790 --> 02:03:17.400
<v Speaker 3>Is that something that looks to eat me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know they're delicious.</v>

2678
02:03:19.860 --> 02:03:20.693
<v Speaker 3>They must,</v>

2679
02:03:20.990 --> 02:03:22.080
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2680
02:03:22.770 --> 02:03:23.603
<v Speaker 4>one one thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on that hunt and we had basically a </v>

2681
02:03:27.891 --> 02:03:31.400
<v Speaker 4>lifetime worth of experience for a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>of guys in a week,</v>

2682
02:03:31.401 --> 02:03:33.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>up there and um,</v>

2683
02:03:33.770 --> 02:03:35.690
<v Speaker 4>because the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the timing was perfect.</v>

2684
02:03:35.790 --> 02:03:36.623
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a few reasons why it was a </v>

2685
02:03:37.401 --> 02:03:41.000
<v Speaker 4>perfect storm up there is the weather </v>
<v Speaker 4>was a storm obviously,</v>

2686
02:03:41.001 --> 02:03:42.500
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of snow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was awesome.</v>

2687
02:03:42.980 --> 02:03:45.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One day we got hammered with snow,</v>

2688
02:03:45.410 --> 02:03:46.243
<v Speaker 4>but the moon phase,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the moon was basically nonexistent the </v>

2689
02:03:51.830 --> 02:03:52.663
<v Speaker 4>last few days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a big thing when the moon is </v>

2690
02:03:53.361 --> 02:03:55.310
<v Speaker 4>full.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Animals are out at night feeding.</v>

2691
02:03:56.030 --> 02:03:59.200
<v Speaker 4>Most of their feeding is done at night </v>
<v Speaker 4>and a little bit during the day to.</v>

2692
02:03:59.370 --> 02:04:01.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm on this week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

2693
02:04:01.381 --> 02:04:02.214
<v Speaker 4>the moon phase was down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they were feeding mostly out during </v>

2694
02:04:05.721 --> 02:04:06.800
<v Speaker 4>the day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that was big.</v>

2695
02:04:06.801 --> 02:04:07.634
<v Speaker 4>The weather was good and then at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time of year so that the bulls were </v>

2696
02:04:09.561 --> 02:04:10.394
<v Speaker 4>reading.</v>

2697
02:04:10.490 --> 02:04:14.720
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just remember one specific and I can't</v>

2698
02:04:14.721 --> 02:04:17.540
<v Speaker 4>wait to show this on the film,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we were,</v>

2699
02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:20.030
<v Speaker 4>there was a bowl bukedde when we heard </v>
<v Speaker 4>it up there in the,</v>

2700
02:04:20.090 --> 02:04:22.160
<v Speaker 4>in the quake ease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was going crazy.</v>

2701
02:04:22.161 --> 02:04:24.290
<v Speaker 4>We want to try to get a good look at </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2702
02:04:24.650 --> 02:04:29.650
<v Speaker 4>So we're standing there and mark womack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who sub segments his company,</v>

2703
02:04:29.811 --> 02:04:32.270
<v Speaker 4>he was filming me and he looks over and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he says,</v>

2704
02:04:32.271 --> 02:04:32.851
<v Speaker 4>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ken,</v>

2705
02:04:32.851 --> 02:04:36.590
<v Speaker 4>there's bull bedded right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was about a little over 100 yards</v>

2706
02:04:36.591 --> 02:04:40.340
<v Speaker 4>away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a six by six bedded and uh,</v>

2707
02:04:40.440 --> 02:04:41.273
<v Speaker 4>with the wind the way it was a Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go see how close I can get </v>

2708
02:04:44.041 --> 02:04:44.874
<v Speaker 4>to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I snuck up there and got within 10 </v>

2709
02:04:47.851 --> 02:04:51.840
<v Speaker 4>feet of this six by six bowl and I got </v>
<v Speaker 4>so close,</v>

2710
02:04:52.530 --> 02:04:55.750
<v Speaker 4>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a tree blocking his,</v>

2711
02:04:56.220 --> 02:04:57.300
<v Speaker 4>his eye wear.</v>

2712
02:04:57.330 --> 02:04:58.880
<v Speaker 4>Normally he'd be able to see me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he,</v>

2713
02:04:58.920 --> 02:05:01.440
<v Speaker 4>where he bedded the tree was blocking </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2714
02:05:01.441 --> 02:05:06.441
<v Speaker 4>So I use that tree and uses the cover of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wind to get in close and that's on,</v>

2715
02:05:08.820 --> 02:05:09.653
<v Speaker 4>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a wild animal that only cares about </v>

2716
02:05:11.431 --> 02:05:14.850
<v Speaker 4>staying alive essentially and for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bull breeding.</v>

2717
02:05:15.210 --> 02:05:16.043
<v Speaker 4>But that is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was an experience I got so close </v>

2718
02:05:19.261 --> 02:05:20.640
<v Speaker 4>that I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2719
02:05:20.641 --> 02:05:22.920
<v Speaker 4>if he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going to know I'm here eventually,</v>

2720
02:05:22.921 --> 02:05:24.480
<v Speaker 4>what am I going?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How close am I going to get?</v>

2721
02:05:24.930 --> 02:05:26.320
<v Speaker 4>What's he going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because they're,</v>

2722
02:05:26.660 --> 02:05:27.960
<v Speaker 4>they're aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This time of year,</v>

2723
02:05:27.990 --> 02:05:30.990
<v Speaker 4>testosterone is skyrocketed because our </v>
<v Speaker 4>breeding and they're fighting.</v>

2724
02:05:30.991 --> 02:05:31.824
<v Speaker 4>They're doing all of this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's he gonna do when he sees me this </v>

2725
02:05:33.631 --> 02:05:35.640
<v Speaker 4>close?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I didn't really know for sure,</v>

2726
02:05:35.641 --> 02:05:40.050
<v Speaker 4>but I felt that wind shift a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>at and I felt it on the back of my neck.</v>

2727
02:05:40.740 --> 02:05:41.573
<v Speaker 4>So I came to full draw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's 10 feet away and he stands up and </v>

2728
02:05:44.941 --> 02:05:49.080
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he knew right then I'm standing plain as</v>

2729
02:05:49.081 --> 02:05:49.914
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once he stood up and we've got an image </v>

2730
02:05:51.421 --> 02:05:52.254
<v Speaker 4>I'll post up here in a second of me at </v>
<v Speaker 4>full draw 10 feet on this big bull </v>

2731
02:05:56.080 --> 02:05:56.913
<v Speaker 4>elephant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Credible.</v>

2732
02:05:56.940 --> 02:05:59.370
<v Speaker 4>But the footage is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's going to be cool to show.</v>

2733
02:05:59.830 --> 02:06:03.590
<v Speaker 3>Now the footage is going to be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we also got footage of a bullet.</v>

2734
02:06:03.650 --> 02:06:05.770
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we couldn't shoot because even though he</v>

2735
02:06:05.771 --> 02:06:06.604
<v Speaker 3>was a huge bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a younger bull who was probably </v>

2736
02:06:08.501 --> 02:06:13.330
<v Speaker 3>five or six years old and it was in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>snow and it was 40 yards away,</v>

2737
02:06:13.331 --> 02:06:15.550
<v Speaker 3>broadside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>screaming his lungs out.</v>

2738
02:06:15.580 --> 02:06:17.590
<v Speaker 3>We're just standing there going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2739
02:06:17.680 --> 02:06:18.513
<v Speaker 3>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just standing on top of the </v>

2740
02:06:19.811 --> 02:06:21.930
<v Speaker 3>mountain going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where's my batch?</v>

2741
02:06:22.070 --> 02:06:22.903
<v Speaker 4>Has to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most people like when you're on public </v>

2742
02:06:28.731 --> 02:06:29.564
<v Speaker 4>land,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when I used to hunt the Eagle cap </v>

2743
02:06:31.431 --> 02:06:32.264
<v Speaker 4>wilderness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that bull's dead or I'm going to try to </v>

2744
02:06:37.401 --> 02:06:38.234
<v Speaker 4>kill that bowl or you gotten.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's all sorts of things that can </v>

2745
02:06:39.831 --> 02:06:40.401
<v Speaker 4>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2746
02:06:40.401 --> 02:06:42.150
<v Speaker 4>when you're shooting an arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

2747
02:06:42.650 --> 02:06:43.483
<v Speaker 4>the reason why where we were hunting and</v>
<v Speaker 4>so good is because it's so well managed </v>

2748
02:06:46.630 --> 02:06:49.280
<v Speaker 4>because normally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's five or six years old,</v>

2749
02:06:49.610 --> 02:06:52.700
<v Speaker 4>that's a hell of a trophy for anybody on</v>
<v Speaker 4>public land.</v>

2750
02:06:53.150 --> 02:06:55.250
<v Speaker 4>But when everybody can come together and</v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

2751
02:06:55.251 --> 02:06:56.900
<v Speaker 4>okay guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's what we're going to do,</v>

2752
02:06:56.901 --> 02:07:00.080
<v Speaker 4>we're only going to kill the eight to 10</v>
<v Speaker 4>year old bulls.</v>

2753
02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:03.050
<v Speaker 4>You let those bulls grow and then you </v>
<v Speaker 4>get an amazing.</v>

2754
02:07:03.380 --> 02:07:06.710
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's one reason why Arizona so good.</v>

2755
02:07:06.910 --> 02:07:07.660
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2756
02:07:07.660 --> 02:07:08.493
<v Speaker 4>they do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they manage it for trophy animals and </v>

2757
02:07:11.211 --> 02:07:12.740
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some places in New Mexico,</v>

2758
02:07:13.060 --> 02:07:14.770
<v Speaker 4>Mexico is good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2759
02:07:14.870 --> 02:07:15.703
<v Speaker 4>there's a place in Oregon is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] or I put in for and it's </v>

2760
02:07:19.851 --> 02:07:20.684
<v Speaker 4>public land,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a really hard tagged drop and </v>

2761
02:07:22.160 --> 02:07:24.440
<v Speaker 4>putting in for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for 17 years now,</v>

2762
02:07:24.950 --> 02:07:27.830
<v Speaker 4>but they only give they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were getting 10,</v>

2763
02:07:27.831 --> 02:07:28.664
<v Speaker 4>I think now they give 20 tags a year and</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's big bulls there and it's just </v>

2764
02:07:32.421 --> 02:07:33.254
<v Speaker 4>because it's managed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's a few different places that </v>

2765
02:07:34.641 --> 02:07:35.474
<v Speaker 4>are managed older animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you're just going straight up </v>

2766
02:07:37.331 --> 02:07:38.164
<v Speaker 4>public land,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really hard to pass up a five or </v>

2767
02:07:40.301 --> 02:07:41.120
<v Speaker 4>six year old boy.</v>

2768
02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:43.760
<v Speaker 3>Now how do they make that decision to </v>
<v Speaker 3>only give 20 tax?</v>

2769
02:07:43.761 --> 02:07:46.160
<v Speaker 3>Because it's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine thousands of people that</v>

2770
02:07:46.161 --> 02:07:47.320
<v Speaker 3>are trying to draw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2771
02:07:47.480 --> 02:07:50.160
<v Speaker 3>these tags and only 20 people get an </v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunity to.</v>

2772
02:07:50.180 --> 02:07:51.013
<v Speaker 3>How do they make that distinction just </v>
<v Speaker 3>by the biologists pick the number of </v>

2773
02:07:54.051 --> 02:07:54.930
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2774
02:07:55.850 --> 02:07:56.683
<v Speaker 3>They just do some sort of a survey and </v>
<v Speaker 3>find out how many of their animals and </v>

2775
02:07:59.740 --> 02:08:00.573
<v Speaker 3>also some places managed for better </v>
<v Speaker 3>genetics and higher potential of what </v>

2776
02:08:03.981 --> 02:08:05.020
<v Speaker 3>they would call.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2777
02:08:05.120 --> 02:08:07.880
<v Speaker 3>there's a real problem with that word </v>
<v Speaker 3>trophy because people think,</v>

2778
02:08:07.881 --> 02:08:09.710
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just want to decorate your wall.</v>

2779
02:08:09.711 --> 02:08:11.050
<v Speaker 3>That animal's body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2780
02:08:11.360 --> 02:08:14.720
<v Speaker 3>You trophy hunter or do you eat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like both.</v>

2781
02:08:14.900 --> 02:08:15.733
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well the truth is an intense experience </v>

2782
02:08:19.461 --> 02:08:22.570
<v Speaker 3>with a mature animal that has a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>x,</v>

2783
02:08:22.910 --> 02:08:26.050
<v Speaker 3>a lot of lifetime of surviving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2784
02:08:26.051 --> 02:08:29.910
<v Speaker 3>like it's a way different animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if when you're around a young bold,</v>

2785
02:08:29.940 --> 02:08:31.490
<v Speaker 3>they don't know anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like babies.</v>

2786
02:08:31.590 --> 02:08:35.100
<v Speaker 4>Well they know spike,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they barely know what's going on.</v>

2787
02:08:35.101 --> 02:08:37.530
<v Speaker 4>Like what are you a spikes been alive </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a year and a half.</v>

2788
02:08:37.590 --> 02:08:40.440
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's where the herd protects them.</v>

2789
02:08:40.730 --> 02:08:43.200
<v Speaker 4>Elk are herd animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they look out for each other.</v>

2790
02:08:43.380 --> 02:08:44.213
<v Speaker 4>So when you have an eight to 10 year old</v>
<v Speaker 4>bull that has a protection of the herd </v>

2791
02:08:49.830 --> 02:08:50.663
<v Speaker 4>but also has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has been around for eight to 10 hunting </v>

2792
02:08:53.701 --> 02:08:55.530
<v Speaker 4>seasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a smart animal.</v>

2793
02:08:55.560 --> 02:08:56.393
<v Speaker 4>He seen some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's seen some stuff and it's a smart </v>

2794
02:08:58.201 --> 02:08:59.034
<v Speaker 4>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2795
02:08:59.190 --> 02:09:00.023
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a guy in camp also that has </v>

2796
02:09:01.860 --> 02:09:04.750
<v Speaker 4>hunted the San Carlos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2797
02:09:04.830 --> 02:09:08.760
<v Speaker 4>Indian reservation and he talked about </v>
<v Speaker 4>this big bolt there.</v>

2798
02:09:08.940 --> 02:09:12.090
<v Speaker 4>That new is being hunted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>circled around them,</v>

2799
02:09:12.150 --> 02:09:17.150
<v Speaker 4>came in from the backside of the hunters</v>
<v Speaker 4>to look at him because he was that,</v>

2800
02:09:17.161 --> 02:09:17.994
<v Speaker 4>that bull had been around and knew what </v>
<v Speaker 4>was going on so much and so they were </v>

2801
02:09:21.571 --> 02:09:25.350
<v Speaker 4>able to track them and see what he did </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he went around behind the hunters.</v>

2802
02:09:25.560 --> 02:09:29.880
<v Speaker 4>And so these animals would imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2803
02:09:29.970 --> 02:09:33.450
<v Speaker 4>this is where they live every day for </v>
<v Speaker 4>eight to 10 years.</v>

2804
02:09:33.620 --> 02:09:35.190
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see some stuff,</v>

2805
02:09:35.220 --> 02:09:39.240
<v Speaker 4>you learn where humans as hunters like </v>
<v Speaker 4>to go.</v>

2806
02:09:39.630 --> 02:09:44.190
<v Speaker 4>So we're probably a minor threat in </v>
<v Speaker 4>comparison to the mountain lions.</v>

2807
02:09:44.310 --> 02:09:44.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2808
02:09:44.910 --> 02:09:47.370
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about how many cats are on</v>
<v Speaker 4>this ranch,</v>

2809
02:09:47.770 --> 02:09:48.440
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

2810
02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:51.600
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they know humans are danger.</v>

2811
02:09:51.990 --> 02:09:53.850
<v Speaker 4>I mean they know that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then like I said,</v>

2812
02:09:54.030 --> 02:09:55.500
<v Speaker 4>they know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2813
02:09:56.010 --> 02:09:58.620
<v Speaker 4>so there are certain places where </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunters,</v>

2814
02:09:58.650 --> 02:10:01.200
<v Speaker 4>regardless of who's there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go to glass,</v>

2815
02:10:01.260 --> 02:10:03.900
<v Speaker 4>go to call.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And those elk know that,</v>

2816
02:10:04.140 --> 02:10:06.390
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see something there.</v>

2817
02:10:06.660 --> 02:10:07.493
<v Speaker 4>That's where I've seen a human.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever they think a human is before </v>

2818
02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:13.740
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

2819
02:10:13.741 --> 02:10:16.980
<v Speaker 4>So it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once you get an age on an animal,</v>

2820
02:10:17.130 --> 02:10:17.963
<v Speaker 4>it gets tough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gets tough to get him killed and I </v>

2821
02:10:20.201 --> 02:10:21.034
<v Speaker 4>would imagine</v>

2822
02:10:21.650 --> 02:10:23.630
<v Speaker 3>mountain lion population as high as it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

2823
02:10:23.690 --> 02:10:24.523
<v Speaker 3>like they have to be on point 24 slash </v>
<v Speaker 3>seven with something that's faster than </v>

2824
02:10:28.011 --> 02:10:31.070
<v Speaker 3>them killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kills them with its teeth.</v>

2825
02:10:31.140 --> 02:10:33.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something that can leap up and literally</v>

2826
02:10:33.470 --> 02:10:34.220
<v Speaker 3>a hold of its neck.</v>

2827
02:10:34.220 --> 02:10:37.640
<v Speaker 1>Remember we were talking to Johnny in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Colorado and he was telling us about the</v>

2828
02:10:37.641 --> 02:10:41.240
<v Speaker 1>footprints that he found.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They found a bunch of cat footprints and</v>

2829
02:10:41.241 --> 02:10:42.074
<v Speaker 1>then they found a bunch of elk </v>
<v Speaker 1>footprints and then they only found the </v>

2830
02:10:44.631 --> 02:10:45.464
<v Speaker 1>elk footprints and then a couple hundred</v>
<v Speaker 1>yards later they found a dead bowl with </v>

2831
02:10:49.191 --> 02:10:51.860
<v Speaker 1>a giant mountain lion clinging to its </v>
<v Speaker 1>neck.</v>

2832
02:10:52.340 --> 02:10:53.173
<v Speaker 1>Like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a hard life when a fucking 150 </v>

2833
02:10:56.121 --> 02:10:58.790
<v Speaker 1>pound cat and bring down a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>pound bull.</v>

2834
02:10:58.910 --> 02:10:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the.</v>

2835
02:10:59.690 --> 02:11:01.680
<v Speaker 1>So the line was on the Bulls back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2836
02:11:01.820 --> 02:11:03.430
<v Speaker 1>so that's why it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

2837
02:11:03.900 --> 02:11:04.733
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some prince were gone and the snow </v>

2838
02:11:06.951 --> 02:11:09.050
<v Speaker 1>because he was up on the bull trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get it killed.</v>

2839
02:11:09.051 --> 02:11:11.060
<v Speaker 1>The bull was taken off for a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred yards.</v>

2840
02:11:11.420 --> 02:11:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Finally the cat club down on probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's wind pipe.</v>

2841
02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:19.100
<v Speaker 1>Got Killed and that's happening outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>of season.</v>

2842
02:11:19.360 --> 02:11:21.280
<v Speaker 1>That's tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's happening every day,</v>

2843
02:11:21.281 --> 02:11:22.010
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>

2844
02:11:22.010 --> 02:11:23.840
<v Speaker 1>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not hunting season.</v>

2845
02:11:23.841 --> 02:11:26.690
<v Speaker 1>That's just real life out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So airs.</v>

2846
02:11:26.990 --> 02:11:28.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2847
02:11:28.940 --> 02:11:29.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's.</v>

2848
02:11:29.600 --> 02:11:33.830
<v Speaker 1>But we kind of started to talk about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trophy hunting aspect of what people,</v>

2849
02:11:34.450 --> 02:11:36.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they have that,</v>

2850
02:11:36.140 --> 02:11:36.973
<v Speaker 1>that trophy hunting moniker that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has negative connotation and that's </v>

2851
02:11:40.791 --> 02:11:41.624
<v Speaker 1>what we talked about this a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>last night on the way back from the </v>

2852
02:11:43.911 --> 02:11:47.450
<v Speaker 1>airport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grizzly hunting in British Columbia,</v>

2853
02:11:47.480 --> 02:11:51.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're stopping that November,</v>

2854
02:11:51.620 --> 02:11:55.880
<v Speaker 1>there'll be no more grizzly hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were killing 250 barrels a year out</v>

2855
02:11:55.881 --> 02:11:56.714
<v Speaker 1>of 15,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're basically just managing the </v>

2856
02:11:59.121 --> 02:12:00.050
<v Speaker 1>population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2857
02:12:00.051 --> 02:12:00.884
<v Speaker 1>you have to take a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals out given the habitat and the </v>

2858
02:12:03.531 --> 02:12:04.364
<v Speaker 1>carrying capacity of the land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially predators because they don't </v>

2859
02:12:06.621 --> 02:12:07.880
<v Speaker 1>have predators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2860
02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:08.743
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what else is going to kill a </v>

2861
02:12:09.441 --> 02:12:10.274
<v Speaker 1>Grizzly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2862
02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:11.360
<v Speaker 1>Nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

2863
02:12:11.460 --> 02:12:12.620
<v Speaker 1>So people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2864
02:12:12.650 --> 02:12:13.550
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2865
02:12:13.551 --> 02:12:14.384
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their numbers will drop down on their </v>

2866
02:12:15.681 --> 02:12:16.514
<v Speaker 1>own if they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they eat all the deer and all the </v>

2867
02:12:19.011 --> 02:12:19.850
<v Speaker 1>moves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right,</v>

2868
02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.730
<v Speaker 1>their numbers will drop down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it will take decades.</v>

2869
02:12:22.730 --> 02:12:24.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're in that time,</v>

2870
02:12:24.770 --> 02:12:27.080
<v Speaker 1>you're going to destroy two different </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

2871
02:12:27.081 --> 02:12:29.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to destroy the ungulates,</v>

2872
02:12:29.650 --> 02:12:33.740
<v Speaker 1>they're going to get devastated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to also destroy the economy</v>

2873
02:12:33.741 --> 02:12:34.574
<v Speaker 1>that comes with hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] like the economy that comes </v>

2874
02:12:36.801 --> 02:12:38.720
<v Speaker 1>with hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those ungulates because they're going to</v>

2875
02:12:38.721 --> 02:12:39.554
<v Speaker 1>get devastated by the overwhelming </v>
<v Speaker 1>population of grizzly bears in the </v>

2876
02:12:42.411 --> 02:12:44.690
<v Speaker 1>economy that comes with hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The grizzly bears,</v>

2877
02:12:44.900 --> 02:12:45.733
<v Speaker 1>which in managing them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're going to have to probably </v>

2878
02:12:47.901 --> 02:12:48.734
<v Speaker 1>do is what they've done with mountain </v>
<v Speaker 1>lions in California where people don't </v>

2879
02:12:51.351 --> 02:12:53.690
<v Speaker 1>know because mountain lion hunting is </v>
<v Speaker 1>outlawed in California.</v>

2880
02:12:53.691 --> 02:12:57.440
<v Speaker 1>So what they do is they hire hunters to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill mountain lions and they've killed,</v>

2881
02:12:57.770 --> 02:13:00.290
<v Speaker 1>I believe they killed almost a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>last year.</v>

2882
02:13:00.291 --> 02:13:02.810
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like 97.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of them,</v>

2883
02:13:02.811 --> 02:13:07.130
<v Speaker 1>they find pets in their body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They find like their primary food source</v>

2884
02:13:07.131 --> 02:13:09.060
<v Speaker 1>more than 50 percent of dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2885
02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:12.980
<v Speaker 1>And they just killing people's dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the lions are still getting killed.</v>

2886
02:13:13.030 --> 02:13:13.863
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's just not a hunter is doing </v>

2887
02:13:14.511 --> 02:13:16.910
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's government basically shoot,</v>

2888
02:13:17.590 --> 02:13:18.423
<v Speaker 1>they can run dogs with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can do all sorts of things to get </v>

2889
02:13:20.071 --> 02:13:22.670
<v Speaker 1>them killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a government paying somebody to</v>

2890
02:13:22.671 --> 02:13:23.504
<v Speaker 1>do it as opposed to hunter's pain for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the opportunity to do it to kill the </v>

2891
02:13:27.051 --> 02:13:29.660
<v Speaker 1>same amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead of money going to the state,</v>

2892
02:13:29.990 --> 02:13:32.130
<v Speaker 1>the state's paying money and it's a lot</v>

2893
02:13:32.130 --> 02:13:32.963
<v Speaker 3>of money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when you're talking about </v>

2894
02:13:33.661 --> 02:13:35.730
<v Speaker 3>something like grizzly bears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grizzly bear,</v>

2895
02:13:35.790 --> 02:13:37.430
<v Speaker 3>what they're saying up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

2896
02:13:37.470 --> 02:13:38.250
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2897
02:13:38.250 --> 02:13:39.083
<v Speaker 3>did some research on it just because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to know how this works because why </v>

2898
02:13:41.820 --> 02:13:44.970
<v Speaker 3>it got was being stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just public outcry.</v>

2899
02:13:45.630 --> 02:13:48.560
<v Speaker 3>And the new government in British </v>
<v Speaker 3>Columbia said,</v>

2900
02:13:48.810 --> 02:13:50.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm in this day and age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2901
02:13:50.491 --> 02:13:53.850
<v Speaker 3>the public just can't stomach grizzly </v>
<v Speaker 3>trophy hunting.</v>

2902
02:13:54.300 --> 02:13:56.630
<v Speaker 3>So the public,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell does the public know?</v>

2903
02:13:56.631 --> 02:13:57.464
<v Speaker 3>The public doesn't even.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not even out there where they </v>

2904
02:13:59.461 --> 02:14:00.294
<v Speaker 3>have a misconception and their their </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas all based on them being in the </v>

2905
02:14:04.321 --> 02:14:09.321
<v Speaker 3>cities and the major population center </v>
<v Speaker 3>of British Columbia in Vancouver.</v>

2906
02:14:09.990 --> 02:14:12.380
<v Speaker 3>It's a big urban liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2907
02:14:12.500 --> 02:14:14.220
<v Speaker 3>probably a lot of different people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their camera.</v>

2908
02:14:14.580 --> 02:14:16.320
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to be generalizing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>find.</v>

2909
02:14:16.321 --> 02:14:18.660
<v Speaker 3>Probably they could have voted for </v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama.</v>

2910
02:14:18.661 --> 02:14:23.370
<v Speaker 3>They would've.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these people that live in Vancouver,</v>

2911
02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:24.233
<v Speaker 3>they come comprise the majority of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are voting in British </v>

2912
02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:29.873
<v Speaker 3>Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so they voted out the grizzly bear </v>

2913
02:14:30.691 --> 02:14:31.524
<v Speaker 3>hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these people like that I know like </v>

2914
02:14:33.181 --> 02:14:35.370
<v Speaker 3>my friend Mike Hawk Ridge who lives in </v>
<v Speaker 3>BC.</v>

2915
02:14:35.420 --> 02:14:36.253
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike's had a lot of experience with </v>

2916
02:14:37.921 --> 02:14:41.880
<v Speaker 3>grizzly bears and wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wolves up there are so plentiful.</v>

2917
02:14:41.881 --> 02:14:45.480
<v Speaker 3>They don't have a bag limit on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can shoot as many wolves as you want</v>

2918
02:14:45.500 --> 02:14:46.333
<v Speaker 3>to encourage you to shoot wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's even a bounty in some places on </v>

2919
02:14:49.111 --> 02:14:50.380
<v Speaker 3>wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2920
02:14:50.400 --> 02:14:51.233
<v Speaker 3>and do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think this was a little different </v>

2921
02:14:54.031 --> 02:14:57.810
<v Speaker 3>up there with the bears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they voted it out per se.</v>

2922
02:14:58.140 --> 02:14:58.973
<v Speaker 3>I think the new government came in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They took a poll and said who supports </v>

2923
02:15:04.531 --> 02:15:08.370
<v Speaker 3>grizzly hunting and whatever 71 or 74 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent said they were opposed,</v>

2924
02:15:08.580 --> 02:15:11.490
<v Speaker 3>so the new government just said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2925
02:15:12.090 --> 02:15:13.740
<v Speaker 3>we're going to make the decision to stop</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2926
02:15:13.950 --> 02:15:15.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't stop it.</v>

2927
02:15:15.150 --> 02:15:18.210
<v Speaker 3>This is what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can hunt the grizzlies for meat,</v>

2928
02:15:18.630 --> 02:15:22.590
<v Speaker 3>but you can't keep the rug or the skull </v>
<v Speaker 3>or the skull,</v>

2929
02:15:22.680 --> 02:15:23.520
<v Speaker 3>the hider,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the skull,</v>

2930
02:15:23.550 --> 02:15:25.170
<v Speaker 3>which people consider trophies.</v>

2931
02:15:25.220 --> 02:15:26.053
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what the problem with that is that </v>

2932
02:15:27.301 --> 02:15:29.310
<v Speaker 3>is also a resource.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

2933
02:15:29.320 --> 02:15:30.153
<v Speaker 3>you're eliminating a resource.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you shoot a bear and you eat the </v>

2934
02:15:32.881 --> 02:15:35.220
<v Speaker 3>bear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why wouldn't you keep the rug,</v>

2935
02:15:35.280 --> 02:15:38.760
<v Speaker 3>like have a bear rug in your house to </v>
<v Speaker 3>commemorate that experience.</v>

2936
02:15:39.060 --> 02:15:41.070
<v Speaker 3>And also it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2937
02:15:41.071 --> 02:15:44.640
<v Speaker 3>people have bare skin rugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always been.</v>

2938
02:15:44.730 --> 02:15:47.990
<v Speaker 3>I had about 50 of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

2939
02:15:48.120 --> 02:15:49.900
<v Speaker 3>it's something that people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2940
02:15:49.901 --> 02:15:53.400
<v Speaker 3>like if you're eating the animal that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>also a part of the animal,</v>

2941
02:15:53.401 --> 02:15:55.860
<v Speaker 3>why would you be compelled to throw that</v>
<v Speaker 3>away?</v>

2942
02:15:55.970 --> 02:15:58.140
<v Speaker 3>That seems incredibly wasteful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2943
02:15:58.141 --> 02:15:59.430
<v Speaker 3>it's disrespectful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2944
02:15:59.431 --> 02:16:03.420
<v Speaker 3>It's also disrespectful to just shoot an</v>
<v Speaker 3>animal just for its skin.</v>

2945
02:16:03.780 --> 02:16:06.000
<v Speaker 3>If you're a type of person was to shoot </v>
<v Speaker 3>an elephant,</v>

2946
02:16:06.001 --> 02:16:08.520
<v Speaker 3>just take the tusks and let them meet </v>
<v Speaker 3>Rod.</v>

2947
02:16:08.550 --> 02:16:10.290
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people think that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>disrespectful.</v>

2948
02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:13.580
<v Speaker 3>That's where trophy hunting gets its bad</v>
<v Speaker 3>monica.</v>

2949
02:16:13.650 --> 02:16:16.890
<v Speaker 3>So what they've done is the opposite of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what makes sense.</v>

2950
02:16:17.010 --> 02:16:17.843
<v Speaker 3>You've or you've removed part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>value of that animal and you've also </v>

2951
02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:25.140
<v Speaker 3>removed most of the economy of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting that animal.</v>

2952
02:16:25.170 --> 02:16:26.400
<v Speaker 3>So most people are not going to hunt </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2953
02:16:26.430 --> 02:16:30.310
<v Speaker 3>What they said was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they were killing 250 a year and</v>

2954
02:16:30.340 --> 02:16:35.340
<v Speaker 4>they could get like out of country or or</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoever,</v>

2955
02:16:35.650 --> 02:16:40.090
<v Speaker 4>whatever hunters to pay $25,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>to hunt those bare.</v>

2956
02:16:40.660 --> 02:16:43.320
<v Speaker 4>So it was 25,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>times 250.</v>

2957
02:16:43.450 --> 02:16:46.270
<v Speaker 4>It's like a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

2958
02:16:46.271 --> 02:16:48.160
<v Speaker 4>it's like stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Over a thousand dollars</v>

2959
02:16:48.170 --> 02:16:49.190
<v Speaker 3>it seems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're both stupid.</v>

2960
02:16:49.850 --> 02:16:51.440
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that money,</v>

2961
02:16:51.560 --> 02:16:54.050
<v Speaker 3>just like the lines of dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like the lion hunting.</v>

2962
02:16:54.170 --> 02:16:56.450
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should be able to figure that out.</v>

2963
02:16:56.451 --> 02:16:59.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't want it to Jamie a hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many tags they give?</v>

2964
02:17:00.350 --> 02:17:03.670
<v Speaker 3>Two hundred and 50.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two hundred 50 times 20 slash 25,000.</v>

2965
02:17:03.950 --> 02:17:06.600
<v Speaker 3>What does that smart people say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Figured it out.</v>

2966
02:17:06.601 --> 02:17:07.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get take.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2967
02:17:09.930 --> 02:17:12.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fifty dollars million.</v>

2968
02:17:12.630 --> 02:17:14.970
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to have a pen and paper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say $50 million,</v>

2969
02:17:15.800 --> 02:17:17.580
<v Speaker 3>6 million,</v>
<v Speaker 3>250,</v>

2970
02:17:17.760 --> 02:17:19.560
<v Speaker 3>6 million,</v>
<v Speaker 3>250,</v>

2971
02:17:19.561 --> 02:17:22.200
<v Speaker 3>whatever dollars always wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so think of that.</v>

2972
02:17:22.630 --> 02:17:23.463
<v Speaker 3>Now think that's the money that's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That money is now no longer going into </v>

2973
02:17:26.611 --> 02:17:29.310
<v Speaker 3>the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they're going to have what they call</v>

2974
02:17:29.340 --> 02:17:30.173
<v Speaker 3>problem bears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now problem bears are bears that attack </v>

2975
02:17:31.921 --> 02:17:34.530
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is very frequent bears that attack</v>

2976
02:17:34.531 --> 02:17:35.940
<v Speaker 3>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>livestock,</v>

2977
02:17:35.941 --> 02:17:36.774
<v Speaker 3>bears that encroach upon people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>established residences and communities </v>

2978
02:17:41.311 --> 02:17:42.144
<v Speaker 3>and start eating garbage cans and </v>
<v Speaker 3>killing pets and things along those </v>

2979
02:17:44.641 --> 02:17:45.474
<v Speaker 3>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they have to hire people to go out </v>

2980
02:17:46.981 --> 02:17:47.814
<v Speaker 3>and kill these bears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's going to cost thousands of </v>

2981
02:17:50.490 --> 02:17:51.323
<v Speaker 3>dollars a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have to pay for </v>

2982
02:17:52.141 --> 02:17:52.974
<v Speaker 3>equipment dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They usually have to track them with </v>

2983
02:17:54.781 --> 02:17:57.410
<v Speaker 3>dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These dogs have to be trained.</v>

2984
02:17:57.430 --> 02:17:58.263
<v Speaker 3>You have to get specialists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows you're doing tends to be more </v>

2985
02:18:00.361 --> 02:18:03.270
<v Speaker 3>than one because they need backup </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you didn't know a thousand pound</v>

2986
02:18:03.271 --> 02:18:03.780
<v Speaker 3>animal.</v>

2987
02:18:03.780 --> 02:18:05.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you want dogs on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>grizzly.</v>

2988
02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.340
<v Speaker 3>I think that's how they find them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2989
02:18:08.610 --> 02:18:10.260
<v Speaker 3>I think that's black bear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2990
02:18:10.290 --> 02:18:11.123
<v Speaker 3>One of the guys that was on a Grizzly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a greedy Bowman podcast was totally </v>

2991
02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:17.580
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dogs at the grizzly.</v>

2992
02:18:17.581 --> 02:18:18.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That they use dogs.</v>

2993
02:18:19.350 --> 02:18:21.030
<v Speaker 3>Dogs wouldn't last long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2994
02:18:21.031 --> 02:18:24.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they engage the grizzly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they find them,</v>

2995
02:18:24.730 --> 02:18:28.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and bark at him and obey him up and then</v>

2996
02:18:28.500 --> 02:18:29.121
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2997
02:18:29.121 --> 02:18:32.040
<v Speaker 3>they locate them and then that's when </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hunter comes in.</v>

2998
02:18:32.070 --> 02:18:32.903
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's the other thing that people </v>

2999
02:18:34.771 --> 02:18:38.520
<v Speaker 3>don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That idea of using dogs to hunt animals,</v>

3000
02:18:39.120 --> 02:18:42.180
<v Speaker 3>but that's one of the more effective </v>
<v Speaker 3>ways to find these animals.</v>

3001
02:18:42.181 --> 02:18:46.590
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the best ways they use in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of states to find mountain lions and</v>

3002
02:18:46.591 --> 02:18:48.570
<v Speaker 3>people think it's fucked up and cruel.</v>

3003
02:18:48.620 --> 02:18:51.080
<v Speaker 4>The only effective way to hunt mountain </v>
<v Speaker 4>lions to be,</v>

3004
02:18:51.290 --> 02:18:52.370
<v Speaker 4>to be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3005
02:18:52.371 --> 02:18:54.470
<v Speaker 4>you can gamble,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might see one,</v>

3006
02:18:54.471 --> 02:18:56.930
<v Speaker 4>have a tag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I buy a tag in Oregon every year.</v>

3007
02:18:57.320 --> 02:19:00.340
<v Speaker 4>I've seen about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

3008
02:19:00.510 --> 02:19:03.680
<v Speaker 4>I think I've seen three mountain lions </v>
<v Speaker 4>in 30 years.</v>

3009
02:19:03.980 --> 02:19:04.813
<v Speaker 4>I have a tag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I've had a shot one time didn't </v>

3010
02:19:07.431 --> 02:19:08.264
<v Speaker 4>get killed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you have dogs then you can say </v>

3011
02:19:11.271 --> 02:19:12.140
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have,</v>

3012
02:19:13.280 --> 02:19:14.870
<v Speaker 4>we have 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>mountain lions,</v>

3013
02:19:15.180 --> 02:19:17.030
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need to take out,</v>

3014
02:19:17.140 --> 02:19:18.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>$500 a year.</v>

3015
02:19:19.100 --> 02:19:19.933
<v Speaker 4>So like a lot of states have once </v>
<v Speaker 4>because once you kill a lion then you </v>

3016
02:19:24.201 --> 02:19:26.990
<v Speaker 4>have to go to game and fish and get it </v>
<v Speaker 4>checked in.</v>

3017
02:19:28.100 --> 02:19:30.950
<v Speaker 3>They do measurements to do all this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these different things.</v>

3018
02:19:31.070 --> 02:19:35.120
<v Speaker 3>And so once 500 lines of come in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the season stops,</v>

3019
02:19:35.660 --> 02:19:37.110
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they have a,</v>

3020
02:19:37.460 --> 02:19:40.720
<v Speaker 3>a mortality threshold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to have that.</v>

3021
02:19:40.880 --> 02:19:42.320
<v Speaker 3>Once they reached that limit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they said,</v>

3022
02:19:42.420 --> 02:19:44.930
<v Speaker 3>well we have 10,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need to kill 500 a year.</v>

3023
02:19:44.931 --> 02:19:45.764
<v Speaker 3>So once we kill 500 season's over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And why would you want to kill them </v>

3024
02:19:48.270 --> 02:19:49.580
<v Speaker 3>online?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand.</v>

3025
02:19:49.610 --> 02:19:50.320
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

3026
02:19:50.320 --> 02:19:51.120
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3027
02:19:51.120 --> 02:19:51.953
<v Speaker 3>you to control again the population of </v>
<v Speaker 3>predators because nothing else does and </v>

3028
02:19:55.671 --> 02:19:57.350
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can eat mountain lions and there are</v>

3029
02:19:57.351 --> 02:19:58.880
<v Speaker 3>apparently delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3030
02:19:59.210 --> 02:20:00.610
<v Speaker 3>You had it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3031
02:20:00.611 --> 02:20:01.940
<v Speaker 3>I never have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3032
02:20:02.270 --> 02:20:05.180
<v Speaker 3>I know people that have written,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Allah says it's absolutely delicious.</v>

3033
02:20:05.181 --> 02:20:07.220
<v Speaker 3>He shot them out in line last year for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the first time.</v>

3034
02:20:07.221 --> 02:20:09.870
<v Speaker 3>He's had it before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's never had his own instead.</v>

3035
02:20:09.950 --> 02:20:11.870
<v Speaker 3>It was sensational.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I definitely eat it.</v>

3036
02:20:11.870 --> 02:20:12.703
<v Speaker 3>I want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to hunt lion and never have </v>

3037
02:20:14.030 --> 02:20:17.210
<v Speaker 3>before and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>using the dogs.</v>

3038
02:20:18.080 --> 02:20:20.870
<v Speaker 3>The dogs are a tool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're a tool,</v>

3039
02:20:20.900 --> 02:20:22.820
<v Speaker 3>like a bow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a rifle.</v>

3040
02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:28.000
<v Speaker 3>It's just those dogs have been trained </v>
<v Speaker 3>so well and love what they do.</v>

3041
02:20:28.850 --> 02:20:31.970
<v Speaker 3>The owners love the dogs and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just.</v>

3042
02:20:32.030 --> 02:20:34.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

3043
02:20:34.251 --> 02:20:39.251
<v Speaker 3>it's such a special bond between them </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then just being part of that is just</v>

3044
02:20:40.910 --> 02:20:44.720
<v Speaker 3>another amazing hunting experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a different tool to use.</v>

3045
02:20:45.050 --> 02:20:45.883
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I think people think of dogs as </v>

3046
02:20:47.241 --> 02:20:52.010
<v Speaker 3>being only pets and that's what they </v>
<v Speaker 3>should be used as in dog shouldn't work,</v>

3047
02:20:52.011 --> 02:20:53.970
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is an.</v>

3048
02:20:54.020 --> 02:20:56.260
<v Speaker 3>I understand that because I have pets </v>
<v Speaker 3>and no,</v>

3049
02:20:56.450 --> 02:20:59.180
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't want Marshall to go out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>get attack.</v>

3050
02:20:59.570 --> 02:21:01.490
<v Speaker 3>Barsha would shit his pants if even saw </v>
<v Speaker 3>a bear,</v>

3051
02:21:01.970 --> 02:21:02.803
<v Speaker 3>but this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's different kinds of dogs that </v>

3052
02:21:05.841 --> 02:21:07.850
<v Speaker 3>were bred for a very specific purpose.</v>

3053
02:21:07.850 --> 02:21:10.400
<v Speaker 3>That's what those dogs want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do it.</v>

3054
02:21:10.401 --> 02:21:11.234
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the things that Aaron </v>
<v Speaker 3>Schneider talked about in the podcast </v>

3055
02:21:13.071 --> 02:21:13.904
<v Speaker 3>where he was standing in the wrong place</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they opened up the pen to let the </v>

3056
02:21:17.900 --> 02:21:22.010
<v Speaker 3>grizzly dogs out and the dog just leaped</v>
<v Speaker 3>and slammed him in the chest.</v>

3057
02:21:22.011 --> 02:21:23.750
<v Speaker 3>And it just about really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm unconscious.</v>

3058
02:21:24.350 --> 02:21:27.650
<v Speaker 3>Which podcast is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the Gritty Bowman podcasts.</v>

3059
02:21:27.830 --> 02:21:30.290
<v Speaker 3>The more recent ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me see if I could pull up the number</v>

3060
02:21:30.560 --> 02:21:32.390
<v Speaker 3>because I was listening to it recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3061
02:21:32.600 --> 02:21:35.510
<v Speaker 3>greedy bowman is a very good podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3062
02:21:35.570 --> 02:21:36.403
<v Speaker 3>by these guys that have Ryan as far as </v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian call and Aaron Snyder and I'm the </v>

3063
02:21:41.060 --> 02:21:46.060
<v Speaker 3>number episode two 81 to 82.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

3064
02:21:48.600 --> 02:21:51.770
<v Speaker 3>and there was another one in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to 82 is the,</v>

3065
02:21:52.010 --> 02:21:52.843
<v Speaker 3>I think the big one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about Predator management with a </v>

3066
02:21:55.430 --> 02:21:57.080
<v Speaker 3>bark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bart Lancaster,</v>

3067
02:21:57.081 --> 02:21:58.700
<v Speaker 3>and that's the one where they really </v>
<v Speaker 3>talked about.</v>

3068
02:21:58.910 --> 02:21:59.743
<v Speaker 3>They talked about guys who lived there </v>
<v Speaker 3>in British Columbia who were talking </v>

3069
02:22:02.361 --> 02:22:06.080
<v Speaker 3>about how when he's not home and he has </v>
<v Speaker 3>to go somewhere,</v>

3070
02:22:06.260 --> 02:22:09.830
<v Speaker 3>he has to leave his dog with his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If his wife goes riding a horse,</v>

3071
02:22:09.831 --> 02:22:10.664
<v Speaker 3>he has to bring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The wife has to bring dogs with her </v>

3072
02:22:13.160 --> 02:22:15.240
<v Speaker 3>because there's so many fucking grizzly </v>
<v Speaker 3>bears out there.</v>

3073
02:22:15.530 --> 02:22:17.900
<v Speaker 3>They have to have something that's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to protect him,</v>

3074
02:22:17.901 --> 02:22:21.620
<v Speaker 3>warn him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and these dogs are not just pets.</v>

3075
02:22:21.621 --> 02:22:25.470
<v Speaker 3>They're also a first line of defense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The let them know that there's danger in</v>

3076
02:22:25.471 --> 02:22:26.304
<v Speaker 3>the area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let them know that bears near and also </v>

3077
02:22:27.840 --> 02:22:29.520
<v Speaker 3>keep the bears away because the bears </v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

3078
02:22:29.521 --> 02:22:30.354
<v Speaker 3>dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to fuck around and the </v>

3079
02:22:31.531 --> 02:22:34.680
<v Speaker 3>dogs start barking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That means people are going to know that</v>

3080
02:22:34.681 --> 02:22:35.970
<v Speaker 3>means outcome the guns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3081
02:22:36.170 --> 02:22:36.930
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3082
02:22:36.930 --> 02:22:38.550
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good deterrent for sure.</v>

3083
02:22:38.610 --> 02:22:40.890
<v Speaker 3>People in Vancouver didn't understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

3084
02:22:40.890 --> 02:22:41.723
<v Speaker 3>They're not there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just sitting there eating Tofu and </v>

3085
02:22:44.281 --> 02:22:44.991
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3086
02:22:44.991 --> 02:22:45.824
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and talking about spirituality and you </v>

3087
02:22:47.731 --> 02:22:49.230
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they,</v>

3088
02:22:49.800 --> 02:22:54.060
<v Speaker 3>they pass these bands and they upset the</v>
<v Speaker 3>entire balance of nature.</v>

3089
02:22:54.210 --> 02:22:58.800
<v Speaker 3>They upset the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the economy of hunting of conservation.</v>

3090
02:22:58.801 --> 02:23:01.640
<v Speaker 3>All these things get good all lopsided </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's.</v>

3091
02:23:01.920 --> 02:23:04.620
<v Speaker 3>I understand where they're coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand the sentiment,</v>

3092
02:23:04.980 --> 02:23:05.813
<v Speaker 3>but it's a lot of it is entirely based </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the images that people have seen in </v>

3093
02:23:10.411 --> 02:23:14.700
<v Speaker 3>movies and Disney films and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>anthropomorphization of these animals.</v>

3094
02:23:14.701 --> 02:23:18.690
<v Speaker 3>Will you attach human characteristics to</v>
<v Speaker 3>these ultra predators,</v>

3095
02:23:18.691 --> 02:23:22.440
<v Speaker 3>these enormous monsters of nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are amazing.</v>

3096
02:23:22.441 --> 02:23:24.210
<v Speaker 3>We don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can speak for myself,</v>

3097
02:23:24.211 --> 02:23:27.330
<v Speaker 3>but I know I'm speaking for you too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't want bears to not be there.</v>

3098
02:23:27.331 --> 02:23:29.970
<v Speaker 3>We don't want wolves to not be there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're amazing.</v>

3099
02:23:30.470 --> 02:23:33.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad that they exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're fucking awesome.</v>

3100
02:23:33.640 --> 02:23:36.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean to be outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard a wolf howl.</v>

3101
02:23:36.570 --> 02:23:39.660
<v Speaker 3>Well I did once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did it with Hawk Ridge in BC,</v>

3102
02:23:39.840 --> 02:23:42.270
<v Speaker 3>but they were like way in the distance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heard wolves howl,</v>

3103
02:23:42.480 --> 02:23:47.100
<v Speaker 3>but to see them and be there when it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening and I saw a grizzly bear wants</v>

3104
02:23:47.101 --> 02:23:49.440
<v Speaker 3>in in Alberta and just to look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

3105
02:23:49.441 --> 02:23:51.570
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see those things.</v>

3106
02:23:51.571 --> 02:23:52.910
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

3107
02:23:53.030 --> 02:23:54.030
<v Speaker 3>it's magical,</v>

3108
02:23:54.570 --> 02:23:59.040
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to be managed in that weird word.</v>

3109
02:23:59.041 --> 02:23:59.920
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

3110
02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:01.770
<v Speaker 2>and that's what people say is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3111
02:24:01.771 --> 02:24:03.610
<v Speaker 2>why are we interfere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interfering?</v>

3112
02:24:03.640 --> 02:24:04.473
<v Speaker 2>Why can't they had figured out </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves they have forever and what </v>

3113
02:24:06.931 --> 02:24:07.764
<v Speaker 2>people don't fail to realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess is no man's always been </v>

3114
02:24:12.091 --> 02:24:13.110
<v Speaker 2>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3115
02:24:13.170 --> 02:24:14.840
<v Speaker 2>we've always hunted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3116
02:24:14.970 --> 02:24:15.810
<v Speaker 2>We've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3117
02:24:15.811 --> 02:24:18.080
<v Speaker 2>we've been involved in how many animals </v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

3118
02:24:18.081 --> 02:24:18.914
<v Speaker 2>are sometimes we've been involved </v>
<v Speaker 2>natively like when we almost wiped out </v>

3119
02:24:21.601 --> 02:24:22.434
<v Speaker 2>the elk or the Buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but lately we've been involved </v>

3120
02:24:26.251 --> 02:24:27.780
<v Speaker 2>positively and we manage them</v>

3121
02:24:28.100 --> 02:24:31.310
<v Speaker 3>and this is the other thing they talked </v>
<v Speaker 3>about on the greedy Bowman podcast where</v>

3122
02:24:31.311 --> 02:24:32.144
<v Speaker 3>they really emphasize the difference </v>
<v Speaker 3>between a biologist who's not in the </v>

3123
02:24:35.091 --> 02:24:37.070
<v Speaker 3>field and these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

3124
02:24:37.071 --> 02:24:39.620
<v Speaker 3>all these different people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's the,</v>

3125
02:24:39.621 --> 02:24:40.454
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3126
02:24:40.620 --> 02:24:41.453
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hunters themselves or whether it's </v>

3127
02:24:43.881 --> 02:24:44.714
<v Speaker 3>the guides or whether it's the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are outfitters that are there 24 </v>

3128
02:24:48.951 --> 02:24:50.300
<v Speaker 3>slash seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three 65.</v>

3129
02:24:50.330 --> 02:24:53.810
<v Speaker 3>They can give you more data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They understand the real numbers is very</v>

3130
02:24:53.811 --> 02:24:54.644
<v Speaker 3>difficult when you're dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially something like British </v>

3131
02:24:57.170 --> 02:24:58.003
<v Speaker 3>Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>intensely wooded area to get a real </v>

3132
02:25:00.591 --> 02:25:02.180
<v Speaker 3>number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3133
02:25:02.181 --> 02:25:03.014
<v Speaker 3>there's no map.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no like you can't just pull up </v>

3134
02:25:05.121 --> 02:25:05.954
<v Speaker 3>the social security numbers of the bears</v>
<v Speaker 3>and find out how many of them are still </v>

3135
02:25:08.091 --> 02:25:08.800
<v Speaker 3>alive and he</v>

3136
02:25:08.800 --> 02:25:10.960
<v Speaker 2>can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can't fly over and get account,</v>

3137
02:25:11.020 --> 02:25:15.000
<v Speaker 2>like to do a lot of animals like Caribou</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something who will caribou or it even</v>

3138
02:25:15.010 --> 02:25:17.320
<v Speaker 2>elk where they winter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so elk,</v>

3139
02:25:17.450 --> 02:25:18.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once once winter hits,</v>

3140
02:25:18.941 --> 02:25:21.760
<v Speaker 2>they get pushed down to where they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>get feed in the winter.</v>

3141
02:25:22.060 --> 02:25:24.310
<v Speaker 2>That's where they get to the counts</v>

3142
02:25:24.370 --> 02:25:25.203
<v Speaker 1>right now and so that's where they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a pretty good number or an idea of </v>

3143
02:25:27.611 --> 02:25:30.520
<v Speaker 1>how many elk are in that area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bear don't do you.</v>

3144
02:25:30.650 --> 02:25:33.430
<v Speaker 1>You're never going to fly over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No wintering grounds for bear.</v>

3145
02:25:33.580 --> 02:25:35.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another important thing that Adam</v>

3146
02:25:35.201 --> 02:25:36.034
<v Speaker 1>found out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What Adam Green tree was on this crazy </v>

3147
02:25:38.681 --> 02:25:40.720
<v Speaker 1>walkabout that he was doing for the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>

3148
02:25:41.320 --> 02:25:44.350
<v Speaker 1>He found mountain grizzlies would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He believes and he says,</v>

3149
02:25:44.351 --> 02:25:46.810
<v Speaker 1>and I know that he's a very smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been around a lot of animals.</v>

3150
02:25:47.050 --> 02:25:49.930
<v Speaker 1>He believes is 100 percent mountain </v>
<v Speaker 1>grizzlies in Colorado.</v>

3151
02:25:49.990 --> 02:25:53.110
<v Speaker 1>That's what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He took pictures of them and he even put</v>

3152
02:25:53.111 --> 02:25:53.944
<v Speaker 1>up photos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really hard to see pictures way </v>

3153
02:25:56.141 --> 02:25:58.630
<v Speaker 1>off in the distance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even put a photo up of,</v>

3154
02:25:58.690 --> 02:26:00.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>

3155
02:26:00.231 --> 02:26:03.540
<v Speaker 1>He did online searches for that mountain</v>
<v Speaker 1>range in Colorado.</v>

3156
02:26:03.550 --> 02:26:06.190
<v Speaker 1>They said that it's like people who see </v>
<v Speaker 1>big foot,</v>

3157
02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:07.930
<v Speaker 1>they say they see grizzlies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's like,</v>

3158
02:26:08.050 --> 02:26:08.380
<v Speaker 1>he's.</v>

3159
02:26:08.380 --> 02:26:09.890
<v Speaker 1>He spotted four of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3160
02:26:10.030 --> 02:26:11.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean that,</v>

3161
02:26:11.780 --> 02:26:13.270
<v Speaker 1>that's a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3162
02:26:13.271 --> 02:26:16.030
<v Speaker 1>if those were grizzly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's grizzly.</v>

3163
02:26:16.031 --> 02:26:16.864
<v Speaker 1>We didn't know about how many people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do with Adam did and actually </v>

3164
02:26:18.851 --> 02:26:23.170
<v Speaker 1>go out there 20 plus miles deep into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>woods with a fucking tent and find these</v>

3165
02:26:23.171 --> 02:26:24.004
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incredibly difficult to get real </v>

3166
02:26:26.021 --> 02:26:28.470
<v Speaker 1>world numbers on these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

3167
02:26:28.630 --> 02:26:30.190
<v Speaker 1>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So once you,</v>

3168
02:26:30.220 --> 02:26:31.790
<v Speaker 1>once you take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3169
02:26:32.050 --> 02:26:34.430
<v Speaker 1>once you take the science out of it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3170
02:26:34.490 --> 02:26:37.990
<v Speaker 1>the people with boots on the ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually weighing in on,</v>

3171
02:26:38.320 --> 02:26:39.340
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's how,</v>

3172
02:26:39.400 --> 02:26:42.730
<v Speaker 1>here's how many animals are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's how many we need to kill.</v>

3173
02:26:42.940 --> 02:26:43.773
<v Speaker 1>Once you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they did NBC and the Government </v>

3174
02:26:46.061 --> 02:26:49.330
<v Speaker 1>just decides that the public can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>stomach it anymore because they did.</v>

3175
02:26:49.331 --> 02:26:52.090
<v Speaker 1>Some poll at stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have starbucks in BC,</v>

3176
02:26:52.091 --> 02:26:52.924
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3177
02:26:53.100 --> 02:26:53.933
<v Speaker 1>A pole at starbucks and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is where I went in today by the </v>

3178
02:26:56.981 --> 02:26:59.350
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I still kill stuff.</v>

3179
02:26:59.740 --> 02:27:01.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3180
02:27:01.630 --> 02:27:04.900
<v Speaker 1>that's when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where we cause problems.</v>

3181
02:27:04.930 --> 02:27:06.460
<v Speaker 1>We create issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

3182
02:27:06.510 --> 02:27:09.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we use the wrong tools to.</v>

3183
02:27:09.850 --> 02:27:13.000
<v Speaker 1>We're still managing the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the animals but not correctly.</v>

3184
02:27:13.180 --> 02:27:14.013
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also the decisions are based on </v>

3185
02:27:15.521 --> 02:27:16.354
<v Speaker 1>emotions without real information based </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the actual environment that these </v>

3186
02:27:21.341 --> 02:27:22.580
<v Speaker 1>animals live in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>

3187
02:27:23.080 --> 02:27:23.913
<v Speaker 1>you could never imagine if you lived in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vancouver and which some of the best </v>

3188
02:27:27.191 --> 02:27:28.024
<v Speaker 1>restaurants in the world and drove some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the nicest streets and I mean </v>

3189
02:27:31.120 --> 02:27:31.953
<v Speaker 1>Vancouver is an amazing city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you live there and you had this idea </v>

3190
02:27:35.710 --> 02:27:38.500
<v Speaker 1>of what wildlife is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you never left Vancouver if you.</v>

3191
02:27:38.501 --> 02:27:39.130
<v Speaker 1>Did you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3192
02:27:39.130 --> 02:27:41.020
<v Speaker 1>we visited Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>

3193
02:27:41.130 --> 02:27:42.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now like you don't know,</v>

3194
02:27:42.700 --> 02:27:43.533
<v Speaker 1>like you literally have to be there to </v>
<v Speaker 1>just kind of get a sense of it and you </v>

3195
02:27:47.321 --> 02:27:50.470
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't get a sense of it in one trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to be there all the time.</v>

3196
02:27:50.471 --> 02:27:51.304
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to take multiple excursions </v>

3197
02:27:53.021 --> 02:27:56.170
<v Speaker 1>into the forest to really understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're talking about,</v>

3198
02:27:56.171 --> 02:27:57.004
<v Speaker 1>what you're dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to make those decisions based on </v>

3199
02:28:00.161 --> 02:28:02.950
<v Speaker 1>people who are completely ignorant about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that situation.</v>

3200
02:28:03.060 --> 02:28:03.893
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3201
02:28:04.600 --> 02:28:05.411
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3202
02:28:05.411 --> 02:28:05.750
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3203
02:28:05.750 --> 02:28:06.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3204
02:28:06.820 --> 02:28:08.680
<v Speaker 1>it's a ridiculous way to handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3205
02:28:08.710 --> 02:28:09.543
<v Speaker 1>so thankfully here in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do have a great system for wildlife </v>

3206
02:28:14.351 --> 02:28:15.184
<v Speaker 1>management and our government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except for here in California with the </v>

3207
02:28:19.001 --> 02:28:22.550
<v Speaker 1>mountain lions trust the professionals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biologists,</v>

3208
02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:23.960
<v Speaker 2>the people out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3209
02:28:23.990 --> 02:28:25.990
<v Speaker 2>boots on the ground as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we,</v>

3210
02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:31.690
<v Speaker 2>we trust those people to allocate tags </v>
<v Speaker 2>to give us numbers to,</v>

3211
02:28:32.070 --> 02:28:37.070
<v Speaker 2>to help manage the hunt seasons and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how many tags are for each area.</v>

3212
02:28:37.580 --> 02:28:39.920
<v Speaker 2>So thankfully that's continued to happen</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

3213
02:28:39.960 --> 02:28:42.150
<v Speaker 3>but even here it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets protested.</v>

3214
02:28:42.190 --> 02:28:44.970
<v Speaker 3>It gets the delisting of wolves and area</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they're starting to desert,</v>

3215
02:28:45.060 --> 02:28:47.900
<v Speaker 3>desolate or devastating of grizzlies </v>
<v Speaker 3>surface.</v>

3216
02:28:48.510 --> 02:28:51.210
<v Speaker 3>And that's going to get pushed back to </v>
<v Speaker 3>and people are going to sue against it.</v>

3217
02:28:51.211 --> 02:28:55.560
<v Speaker 3>But the idea is not to kill all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>

3218
02:28:55.561 --> 02:29:00.240
<v Speaker 3>The idea is not to to satisfy the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bloodthirsty urges,</v>

3219
02:29:00.300 --> 02:29:01.133
<v Speaker 3>some fat redneck that people have in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their mind as being the stereotypical </v>

3220
02:29:07.081 --> 02:29:09.570
<v Speaker 3>hunter that they see as a bad guy in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>

3221
02:29:09.660 --> 02:29:11.280
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like in a movie,</v>

3222
02:29:11.640 --> 02:29:12.473
<v Speaker 3>it's always like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember the scene of Wolverine where </v>

3223
02:29:13.771 --> 02:29:14.604
<v Speaker 3>there's are the bad guys that killed the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bear and he goes and fucks those bad </v>

3224
02:29:17.671 --> 02:29:18.504
<v Speaker 3>guys up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you shoot that bear with poison or </v>

3225
02:29:20.600 --> 02:29:21.890
<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drinking.</v>

3226
02:29:22.220 --> 02:29:24.390
<v Speaker 3>It's lighthearted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so stereotypical.</v>

3227
02:29:24.391 --> 02:29:27.720
<v Speaker 3>It's like the idea that every beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman has to be stupid.</v>

3228
02:29:27.870 --> 02:29:30.090
<v Speaker 3>It's just as offensive.</v>

3229
02:29:30.090 --> 02:29:30.923
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is the stereotype that we've </v>

3230
02:29:33.570 --> 02:29:34.403
<v Speaker 3>been fed because it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a classic cliche sort of a </v>

3231
02:29:38.761 --> 02:29:39.960
<v Speaker 3>scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3232
02:29:39.990 --> 02:29:41.850
<v Speaker 3>It's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see it in the movie,</v>

3233
02:29:41.851 --> 02:29:43.170
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jocks are big,</v>

3234
02:29:43.171 --> 02:29:44.400
<v Speaker 3>dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid guys.</v>

3235
02:29:44.770 --> 02:29:47.170
<v Speaker 3>A hot girls are bimbos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3236
02:29:47.180 --> 02:29:49.350
<v Speaker 3>the nerdy guy with glasses is always </v>
<v Speaker 3>smart.</v>

3237
02:29:49.410 --> 02:29:51.960
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes those nerdy guys with glasses </v>
<v Speaker 3>are fucking idiots.</v>

3238
02:29:51.961 --> 02:29:52.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3239
02:29:52.730 --> 02:29:56.520
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't sometimes a hot girls hot </v>
<v Speaker 3>girls way smarter than us.</v>

3240
02:29:56.610 --> 02:29:57.443
<v Speaker 3>It's all hunters aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most Times that's the thing that </v>

3241
02:30:01.771 --> 02:30:02.604
<v Speaker 3>frustrates the shit out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My experience has been like what we </v>

3242
02:30:05.341 --> 02:30:08.790
<v Speaker 3>experienced this past weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People like Lee and Tiffany,</v>

3243
02:30:08.791 --> 02:30:12.270
<v Speaker 3>people like you and Ben.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really good people.</v>

3244
02:30:12.600 --> 02:30:14.430
<v Speaker 3>Really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nice people.</v>

3245
02:30:14.490 --> 02:30:15.241
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3246
02:30:15.241 --> 02:30:19.710
<v Speaker 3>we know so many people that are involved</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the outdoor world,</v>

3247
02:30:19.740 --> 02:30:21.420
<v Speaker 3>whether the hunting world street,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3248
02:30:21.520 --> 02:30:22.353
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's John Dudley or remy or </v>

3249
02:30:24.600 --> 02:30:26.700
<v Speaker 3>Steve Rinella.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are great people.</v>

3250
02:30:26.730 --> 02:30:27.563
<v Speaker 3>They're exceptional human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People with exceptional character and </v>

3251
02:30:30.841 --> 02:30:31.674
<v Speaker 3>exceptional discipline right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the fat redneck that wants a </v>

3252
02:30:35.521 --> 02:30:36.354
<v Speaker 3>poisoning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Grizzly bear that Wolverine has to beat </v>

3253
02:30:37.771 --> 02:30:39.270
<v Speaker 3>up in the stupid movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3254
02:30:39.330 --> 02:30:40.290
<v Speaker 3>But that's all you see.</v>

3255
02:30:40.390 --> 02:30:41.090
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

3256
02:30:41.090 --> 02:30:43.090
<v Speaker 2>I even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a call out on,</v>

3257
02:30:43.091 --> 02:30:43.924
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like some triple x movie or </v>

3258
02:30:47.080 --> 02:30:49.420
<v Speaker 2>Xander's cage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody,</v>

3259
02:30:49.750 --> 02:30:50.583
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they had the girl on there said </v>

3260
02:30:55.290 --> 02:30:57.430
<v Speaker 2>there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they show these bowhunters getting ready</v>

3261
02:30:57.431 --> 02:30:58.264
<v Speaker 2>to shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did we talk about this on the last time </v>

3262
02:30:59.740 --> 02:31:00.573
<v Speaker 2>getting ready to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe I just put my on my facebook </v>

3263
02:31:02.290 --> 02:31:05.350
<v Speaker 2>getting ready to shoot a lion with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bow.</v>

3264
02:31:06.190 --> 02:31:09.610
<v Speaker 2>She's with a rifle with the rifle scope </v>
<v Speaker 2>on his head.</v>

3265
02:31:09.790 --> 02:31:10.623
<v Speaker 2>She shoots the hunter and she says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a vin diesel calls were on the phone </v>

3266
02:31:15.851 --> 02:31:18.160
<v Speaker 2>about some mission they're going to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the stupid movie,</v>

3267
02:31:18.670 --> 02:31:21.010
<v Speaker 2>and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you up to?</v>

3268
02:31:21.100 --> 02:31:22.860
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in the odds.</v>

3269
02:31:24.360 --> 02:31:27.360
<v Speaker 2>So she was shooting a hunter and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a,</v>

3270
02:31:27.600 --> 02:31:30.330
<v Speaker 2>on a regular movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So corny.</v>

3271
02:31:31.020 --> 02:31:33.690
<v Speaker 2>He talked to people in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want lions</v>

3272
02:31:33.720 --> 02:31:35.550
<v Speaker 3>dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] lions killed their friends.</v>

3273
02:31:35.640 --> 02:31:36.473
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I know a woman who lived in South </v>

3274
02:31:39.750 --> 02:31:42.270
<v Speaker 3>Africa who lost a friend to a lion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3275
02:31:42.630 --> 02:31:46.350
<v Speaker 3>And when you talk to her about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she has that South African accent.</v>

3276
02:31:46.351 --> 02:31:49.720
<v Speaker 3>She's born and raised and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when she talks about lions,</v>

3277
02:31:49.730 --> 02:31:51.960
<v Speaker 3>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just never been around lions,</v>

3278
02:31:51.961 --> 02:31:53.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see what she goes.</v>

3279
02:31:53.251 --> 02:31:54.600
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a,</v>

3280
02:31:54.601 --> 02:31:55.434
<v Speaker 3>there was an article that was written by</v>
<v Speaker 3>a guy from Zimbabwe right after the </v>

3281
02:31:58.621 --> 02:32:01.920
<v Speaker 3>whole season will cecil the lion thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was in the New York Times that said</v>

3282
02:32:01.921 --> 02:32:04.560
<v Speaker 3>in Zimbabwe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we do not cry for lions.</v>

3283
02:32:05.060 --> 02:32:05.620
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3284
02:32:05.620 --> 02:32:08.610
<v Speaker 3>And this was about people that have had </v>
<v Speaker 3>to deal with these things.</v>

3285
02:32:08.611 --> 02:32:10.680
<v Speaker 3>It's not saying that we want all mine's </v>
<v Speaker 3>dead.</v>

3286
02:32:10.720 --> 02:32:12.250
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

3287
02:32:12.251 --> 02:32:14.490
<v Speaker 2>but you got to hunt them so they're out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the ordinary</v>

3288
02:32:14.650 --> 02:32:16.270
<v Speaker 3>but live well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't understand.</v>

3289
02:32:16.300 --> 02:32:21.300
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing as with the grizzly </v>
<v Speaker 3>bears when they made lying hunting.</v>

3290
02:32:21.580 --> 02:32:22.413
<v Speaker 3>Such a dangerous proposition for people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that do it because you're going to get </v>

3291
02:32:25.300 --> 02:32:28.450
<v Speaker 3>ostracized people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna show up at your house and protests</v>

3292
02:32:28.451 --> 02:32:31.990
<v Speaker 3>like they did that dentist guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've had a call lions now.</v>

3293
02:32:32.200 --> 02:32:35.530
<v Speaker 3>Now they have to hire a hitman to go in </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and shoot all these lines and they</v>

3294
02:32:35.531 --> 02:32:38.260
<v Speaker 3>make no money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So instead of making $50,000</v>

3295
02:32:38.261 --> 02:32:40.300
<v Speaker 3>per line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which helps the community,</v>

3296
02:32:40.510 --> 02:32:44.770
<v Speaker 3>helps fund their schools and gives them </v>
<v Speaker 3>money and there's been a lot of articles</v>

3297
02:32:44.771 --> 02:32:48.730
<v Speaker 3>written about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lie of conservation when it comes to</v>

3298
02:32:48.731 --> 02:32:52.390
<v Speaker 3>lying hunting and how little of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually goes to the people,</v>

3299
02:32:52.410 --> 02:32:55.510
<v Speaker 3>the community and how much of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually goes to the outfitters.</v>

3300
02:32:55.810 --> 02:32:59.440
<v Speaker 3>But you know how much of it goes to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>community if you don't have hunters?</v>

3301
02:32:59.920 --> 02:33:01.010
<v Speaker 3>Zero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3302
02:33:01.030 --> 02:33:01.511
<v Speaker 3>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3303
02:33:01.511 --> 02:33:02.344
<v Speaker 3>how much of it goes into community if </v>
<v Speaker 3>these people protest the people that </v>

3304
02:33:05.201 --> 02:33:07.810
<v Speaker 3>don't want line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much did they put in zero?</v>

3305
02:33:07.840 --> 02:33:09.700
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't help those people at all.</v>

3306
02:33:09.730 --> 02:33:11.580
<v Speaker 3>Most of them just are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3307
02:33:11.620 --> 02:33:12.453
<v Speaker 3>Hashtag activists or Internet people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are just posting pictures up on </v>

3308
02:33:18.491 --> 02:33:22.060
<v Speaker 3>instagram and facebook and getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>people riled up and starting petitions.</v>

3309
02:33:22.061 --> 02:33:25.090
<v Speaker 3>But how much of you actually doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>there?</v>

3310
02:33:25.150 --> 02:33:26.560
<v Speaker 3>Are they doing anything?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3311
02:33:26.710 --> 02:33:28.650
<v Speaker 3>You gotTa Manage Lions?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3312
02:33:28.750 --> 02:33:29.583
<v Speaker 3>Nobody likes to hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you want people to live in the </v>

3313
02:33:32.261 --> 02:33:33.094
<v Speaker 3>same vicinity as lions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to make sure the lion </v>

3314
02:33:35.321 --> 02:33:37.270
<v Speaker 3>population doesn't get too crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3315
02:33:37.660 --> 02:33:39.940
<v Speaker 3>And also they devastate the unused </v>
<v Speaker 3>population.</v>

3316
02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:41.680
<v Speaker 3>They devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the reasons why they had a</v>

3317
02:33:41.681 --> 02:33:42.700
<v Speaker 3>column in Zimbabwe.</v>

3318
02:33:42.790 --> 02:33:43.623
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

3319
02:33:43.980 --> 02:33:44.813
<v Speaker 2>there's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not like they have a bunch of stores </v>

3320
02:33:47.021 --> 02:33:49.330
<v Speaker 2>with stock fall me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have cows,</v>

3321
02:33:49.420 --> 02:33:51.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of what they have.</v>

3322
02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:56.200
<v Speaker 2>They have cows and their domestic </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals that they used for food.</v>

3323
02:33:56.340 --> 02:33:59.110
<v Speaker 2>This lions come in and kill a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>

3324
02:33:59.111 --> 02:34:03.610
<v Speaker 2>So I mean to them a $600 a cow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's huge.</v>

3325
02:34:03.730 --> 02:34:06.050
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at $600 a cow is,</v>

3326
02:34:06.580 --> 02:34:08.530
<v Speaker 2>could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to say life or death,</v>

3327
02:34:08.531 --> 02:34:13.000
<v Speaker 2>but if that gets killed by a lion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drastically impacts their life.</v>

3328
02:34:13.060 --> 02:34:13.893
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

3329
02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.880
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people have ideas about </v>
<v Speaker 3>wildlife.</v>

3330
02:34:16.881 --> 02:34:17.714
<v Speaker 3>They're shaped by movies and by </v>
<v Speaker 3>television shows and we have this </v>

3331
02:34:22.060 --> 02:34:27.060
<v Speaker 3>unrealistic depiction and that this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>not in support or against hunting.</v>

3332
02:34:28.150 --> 02:34:29.260
<v Speaker 3>This is just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

3333
02:34:29.261 --> 02:34:33.610
<v Speaker 3>the reality of humans and our war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our view of the wild world.</v>

3334
02:34:34.060 --> 02:34:36.400
<v Speaker 3>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you saw that woman last year in,</v>

3335
02:34:36.401 --> 02:34:37.370
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was a,</v>

3336
02:34:37.371 --> 02:34:38.204
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an editor for game of thrones and she </v>

3337
02:34:41.291 --> 02:34:44.350
<v Speaker 3>was in the wild in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3338
02:34:44.351 --> 02:34:47.050
<v Speaker 3>You got drug out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>decided to roll down her window to get a</v>

3339
02:34:47.060 --> 02:34:49.090
<v Speaker 3>better photo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the cat said,</v>

3340
02:34:49.091 --> 02:34:50.710
<v Speaker 3>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just reached in,</v>

3341
02:34:50.711 --> 02:34:52.690
<v Speaker 3>grabbed her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pulled her out of the car and killed her</v>

3342
02:34:52.691 --> 02:34:54.280
<v Speaker 3>in front of everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He drug her out.</v>

3343
02:34:54.340 --> 02:34:56.880
<v Speaker 3>That's what a lion does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3344
02:34:57.120 --> 02:34:59.770
<v Speaker 3>Now it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lions not doing that because she was</v>

3345
02:34:59.771 --> 02:35:03.640
<v Speaker 3>antagonizing or because it was hungry </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's a killing machine.</v>

3346
02:35:03.641 --> 02:35:06.490
<v Speaker 3>It's nature's killing machine is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason why we're not,</v>

3347
02:35:06.750 --> 02:35:09.100
<v Speaker 3>that you don't have to hack your way </v>
<v Speaker 3>through a river of gazelles.</v>

3348
02:35:09.101 --> 02:35:11.590
<v Speaker 3>Get your fucking car is because those </v>
<v Speaker 3>cats,</v>

3349
02:35:11.650 --> 02:35:12.790
<v Speaker 3>those cats exist.</v>

3350
02:35:13.130 --> 02:35:14.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's um,</v>

3351
02:35:14.720 --> 02:35:15.181
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3352
02:35:15.181 --> 02:35:16.014
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad for this forum to talk about </v>

3353
02:35:19.251 --> 02:35:20.084
<v Speaker 2>things like this because I know we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>made an impact and because of you and </v>

3354
02:35:24.110 --> 02:35:24.943
<v Speaker 2>you reach so many people and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>wearing an under armour shirt right now </v>

3355
02:35:27.921 --> 02:35:32.570
<v Speaker 2>with a big bowl on it and a and a white </v>
<v Speaker 2>bow hunting hat and it's just like,</v>

3356
02:35:33.320 --> 02:35:34.153
<v Speaker 2>I feel like there's been education </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening for a few years now and we're </v>

3357
02:35:38.450 --> 02:35:39.283
<v Speaker 2>slowly turning the tide and people do </v>
<v Speaker 2>care more about where their food comes </v>

3358
02:35:43.191 --> 02:35:44.024
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of the process of how my had this </v>

3359
02:35:45.591 --> 02:35:47.480
<v Speaker 2>food get to my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not everybody's thinking that,</v>

3360
02:35:47.720 --> 02:35:50.020
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3361
02:35:50.480 --> 02:35:55.480
<v Speaker 2>it just feels like also like bowhunting </v>
<v Speaker 2>is just a cool thing to be involved.</v>

3362
02:35:56.121 --> 02:35:57.050
<v Speaker 2>Shooting a bow is</v>

3363
02:35:57.510 --> 02:35:59.040
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bose awesome.</v>

3364
02:35:59.110 --> 02:36:00.200
<v Speaker 3>It's fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's exciting.</v>

3365
02:36:00.201 --> 02:36:01.034
<v Speaker 3>And I always tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you want to eat plants for the </v>

3366
02:36:02.311 --> 02:36:04.170
<v Speaker 3>rest of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you never want to kill an animal,</v>

3367
02:36:04.171 --> 02:36:06.870
<v Speaker 3>ever just try archery just for </v>
<v Speaker 3>meditation.</v>

3368
02:36:06.871 --> 02:36:07.704
<v Speaker 3>It's an amazing relaxing thing because </v>
<v Speaker 3>to release a perfect girl and have it </v>

3369
02:36:11.401 --> 02:36:12.234
<v Speaker 3>hit that bull's eyes so difficult and </v>
<v Speaker 3>involves so many different things that </v>

3370
02:36:15.091 --> 02:36:19.260
<v Speaker 3>you have to manage and control that </v>
<v Speaker 3>inducing that it's sort of cleanses your</v>

3371
02:36:19.261 --> 02:36:20.100
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3372
02:36:20.220 --> 02:36:21.060
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

3373
02:36:21.130 --> 02:36:22.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing better.</v>

3374
02:36:22.541 --> 02:36:25.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I post a video yesterday and we were,</v>

3375
02:36:25.780 --> 02:36:28.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had success on her act</v>

3376
02:36:28.140 --> 02:36:30.070
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have got elk,</v>

3377
02:36:30.370 --> 02:36:31.203
<v Speaker 3>so our hunt was done and we were still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Umi and jed were having a great time </v>

3378
02:36:34.751 --> 02:36:35.584
<v Speaker 3>just shooting arrows and having fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shooting at targets and just laughing </v>

3379
02:36:38.891 --> 02:36:42.400
<v Speaker 3>and making little bets with each other </v>
<v Speaker 3>and stuff and having a great time.</v>

3380
02:36:42.820 --> 02:36:44.780
<v Speaker 3>Do you owe me now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

3381
02:36:45.020 --> 02:36:47.230
<v Speaker 3>we're even where he shadowed me 100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>bucks,</v>

3382
02:36:47.231 --> 02:36:49.750
<v Speaker 3>but I let it slide because under armour </v>
<v Speaker 3>paid for the hunt.</v>

3383
02:36:50.930 --> 02:36:51.763
<v Speaker 3>But it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what's important about podcasts </v>

3384
02:36:56.860 --> 02:36:57.693
<v Speaker 3>and it's not just for hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's important for almost every </v>

3385
02:37:01.810 --> 02:37:02.643
<v Speaker 3>really difficult complex and nuanced </v>
<v Speaker 3>subject is you have to discuss all the </v>

3386
02:37:08.021 --> 02:37:11.620
<v Speaker 3>aspects of it and you can't do that on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>regular television show.</v>

3387
02:37:11.920 --> 02:37:12.753
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you also have to remove a lot of </v>

3388
02:37:16.100 --> 02:37:16.933
<v Speaker 3>unrealistic programming that we have in </v>
<v Speaker 3>our head because of anthropomorphism </v>

3389
02:37:21.530 --> 02:37:22.363
<v Speaker 3>anthropomorphization of animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>attaching human characteristics that </v>

3390
02:37:25.371 --> 02:37:28.490
<v Speaker 3>we've seen in Disney movies and all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>our lives.</v>

3391
02:37:28.490 --> 02:37:29.323
<v Speaker 3>Animals had been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our friends have had teddy bears that </v>

3392
02:37:30.741 --> 02:37:33.500
<v Speaker 3>are our friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Polar bears are selling us Klondike bars</v>

3393
02:37:33.501 --> 02:37:34.334
<v Speaker 3>and Coca Cola.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have all this in our head that these </v>

3394
02:37:36.471 --> 02:37:39.560
<v Speaker 3>are these cute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>awesome things which they are awesome.</v>

3395
02:37:39.561 --> 02:37:42.860
<v Speaker 3>They are beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we don't know what they really are.</v>

3396
02:37:42.950 --> 02:37:45.440
<v Speaker 3>We have an unrealistic idea what they </v>
<v Speaker 3>really are.</v>

3397
02:37:45.560 --> 02:37:47.510
<v Speaker 3>We might see them in the zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3398
02:37:47.511 --> 02:37:49.310
<v Speaker 3>there's the bear in the zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>High Bear.</v>

3399
02:37:49.720 --> 02:37:50.553
<v Speaker 3>This is not what they really are and </v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you have real world experience </v>

3400
02:37:55.191 --> 02:37:58.700
<v Speaker 3>and where they really are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I was saying to Tom,</v>

3401
02:37:59.090 --> 02:38:01.430
<v Speaker 3>the guy who owns the ranch and tell them</v>
<v Speaker 3>land that was saying,</v>

3402
02:38:01.730 --> 02:38:02.563
<v Speaker 3>you get this an amazing place and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think you should take people on guided </v>

3403
02:38:06.951 --> 02:38:09.530
<v Speaker 3>tours that have no intention whatsoever </v>
<v Speaker 3>of hunting.</v>

3404
02:38:09.780 --> 02:38:12.110
<v Speaker 3>Just show them the Rut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wild elk.</v>

3405
02:38:12.170 --> 02:38:15.350
<v Speaker 3>It's so much greater than any experience</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll ever have at the zoo.</v>

3406
02:38:15.710 --> 02:38:16.543
<v Speaker 3>With me and Colton and Jameson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're out there covered in the bushes </v>

3407
02:38:18.801 --> 02:38:20.100
<v Speaker 3>hiding and hearing,</v>

3408
02:38:23.350 --> 02:38:26.050
<v Speaker 3>hearing these elk scream all out as were</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

3409
02:38:26.080 --> 02:38:29.080
<v Speaker 3>this is amazing how many people get to </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience this?</v>

3410
02:38:29.270 --> 02:38:33.460
<v Speaker 3>They had these elk had no idea we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and we got to creep in on them and</v>

3411
02:38:33.461 --> 02:38:36.080
<v Speaker 3>watch them just be wild elk and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>

3412
02:38:36.110 --> 02:38:39.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was thrilling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was incredible with.</v>

3413
02:38:39.550 --> 02:38:41.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm looking all these cows and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thrilled.</v>

3414
02:38:41.870 --> 02:38:42.703
<v Speaker 3>I've no desire to kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at elk that I knew I wasn't </v>

3415
02:38:45.011 --> 02:38:47.470
<v Speaker 3>gonna kill and I was still enjoying </v>
<v Speaker 3>every second of it.</v>

3416
02:38:47.870 --> 02:38:51.400
<v Speaker 3>Like if people could go and experience </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and just be.</v>

3417
02:38:51.430 --> 02:38:52.263
<v Speaker 3>I think you would get like one step </v>
<v Speaker 3>closer to an understanding of that this </v>

3418
02:38:56.981 --> 02:39:01.981
<v Speaker 3>is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this whole world is this wild collection</v>

3419
02:39:02.711 --> 02:39:04.990
<v Speaker 3>of things that are interacting with each</v>
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

3420
02:39:05.020 --> 02:39:05.370
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3421
02:39:05.370 --> 02:39:07.230
<v Speaker 2>And if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just one piece of it,</v>

3422
02:39:07.410 --> 02:39:09.240
<v Speaker 2>you can't really judge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3423
02:39:09.300 --> 02:39:10.680
<v Speaker 2>All of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

3424
02:39:10.681 --> 02:39:11.514
<v Speaker 2>And so what should they do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they should trust people who've </v>

3425
02:39:15.060 --> 02:39:16.470
<v Speaker 2>been there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who've done it,</v>

3426
02:39:16.560 --> 02:39:19.710
<v Speaker 2>who understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who aren't bloodthirsty killers,</v>

3427
02:39:19.920 --> 02:39:23.460
<v Speaker 2>but actually have been out there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>know how it all goes together.</v>

3428
02:39:23.490 --> 02:39:27.990
<v Speaker 2>It's okay to trust people like that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>not think that hunting's bad hunters are</v>

3429
02:39:27.991 --> 02:39:28.980
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'd be like,</v>

3430
02:39:29.310 --> 02:39:31.350
<v Speaker 2>maybe I just didn't get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think so.</v>

3431
02:39:31.600 --> 02:39:33.950
<v Speaker 3>The hunters had a voice before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3432
02:39:33.970 --> 02:39:34.803
<v Speaker 3>I think before podcast came along,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we relied on people like Rinella or </v>

3433
02:39:38.561 --> 02:39:41.800
<v Speaker 3>yourself to write books and then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to read those books.</v>

3434
02:39:41.801 --> 02:39:42.790
<v Speaker 3>Nobody wants to read a fucking</v>

3435
02:39:43.090 --> 02:39:44.290
<v Speaker 2>now and your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your reach.</v>

3436
02:39:44.530 --> 02:39:47.020
<v Speaker 2>So it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's that saying?</v>

3437
02:39:47.560 --> 02:39:50.560
<v Speaker 2>You're preaching to the choir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So whoever's buying the book.</v>

3438
02:39:50.740 --> 02:39:52.180
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's already on your team.</v>

3439
02:39:52.240 --> 02:39:53.073
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this has allowed us to reach to </v>

3440
02:39:54.881 --> 02:39:57.610
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reach people who maybe are on the team.</v>

3441
02:39:57.760 --> 02:40:00.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what we've been able to,</v>

3442
02:40:00.430 --> 02:40:04.900
<v Speaker 2>to vet the vet it and discuss in detail </v>
<v Speaker 2>and go through it.</v>

3443
02:40:04.901 --> 02:40:05.734
<v Speaker 2>So I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I just wish people could have </v>

3444
02:40:08.591 --> 02:40:10.450
<v Speaker 2>more of an open mind about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3445
02:40:10.980 --> 02:40:12.940
<v Speaker 2>and it takes time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does,</v>

3446
02:40:13.070 --> 02:40:13.891
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes time.</v>

3447
02:40:13.891 --> 02:40:14.010
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

3448
02:40:14.010 --> 02:40:14.843
<v Speaker 3>I've got a lot of messages from people </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've talked to a lot of people in </v>

3449
02:40:16.501 --> 02:40:17.334
<v Speaker 3>real life that have said to me that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've changed their thoughts on what </v>

3450
02:40:20.791 --> 02:40:23.640
<v Speaker 3>hunting is by listening to me talk to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Rinella,</v>

3451
02:40:23.820 --> 02:40:25.110
<v Speaker 3>listen to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to you,</v>

3452
02:40:25.170 --> 02:40:26.003
<v Speaker 3>listen to me talk to remy and John </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dudley and all these different people </v>

3453
02:40:29.170 --> 02:40:30.003
<v Speaker 3>where you get a sense of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh well these are like really good </v>

3454
02:40:32.701 --> 02:40:33.770
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are really.</v>

3455
02:40:34.200 --> 02:40:35.033
<v Speaker 3>And these are people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiencing this wild thing and it </v>

3456
02:40:36.421 --> 02:40:37.254
<v Speaker 3>gives them like this itch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I can remember before I ever </v>

3457
02:40:38.911 --> 02:40:39.744
<v Speaker 3>hunted for years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had this weird itch about it where I </v>

3458
02:40:43.240 --> 02:40:45.930
<v Speaker 3>had been fishing most of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3459
02:40:46.120 --> 02:40:50.910
<v Speaker 3>I always go fishing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'd never been hunting until 2012,</v>

3460
02:40:51.180 --> 02:40:53.730
<v Speaker 3>but before that I always had these </v>
<v Speaker 3>thoughts about it.</v>

3461
02:40:53.970 --> 02:40:56.000
<v Speaker 3>Like I'd always sit around and I'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3462
02:40:56.010 --> 02:40:56.843
<v Speaker 3>what it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's got to be the best way to get </v>

3463
02:40:58.261 --> 02:40:58.920
<v Speaker 3>meat.</v>

3464
02:40:58.920 --> 02:41:01.140
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be the healthiest for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would buy like,</v>

3465
02:41:01.290 --> 02:41:02.123
<v Speaker 3>I would always order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if they had venison and a </v>

3466
02:41:03.421 --> 02:41:05.530
<v Speaker 3>restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd always order it or you know,</v>

3467
02:41:05.640 --> 02:41:08.280
<v Speaker 3>elk or bison or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3468
02:41:08.281 --> 02:41:09.270
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it tastes different.</v>

3469
02:41:09.271 --> 02:41:11.490
<v Speaker 3>It tastes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's farm raised bullshit.</v>

3470
02:41:11.520 --> 02:41:14.160
<v Speaker 3>You know when you're buying venison and </v>
<v Speaker 3>a store,</v>

3471
02:41:14.161 --> 02:41:16.800
<v Speaker 3>you're not getting a wild deer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're getting some weird.</v>

3472
02:41:16.801 --> 02:41:19.440
<v Speaker 3>Can't sell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you're mostly getting it from New</v>

3473
02:41:19.440 --> 02:41:21.060
<v Speaker 3>Zealand in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really weird.</v>

3474
02:41:21.061 --> 02:41:21.894
<v Speaker 3>You're getting a lot of New Zealand elk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I would think about it for the </v>

3475
02:41:27.841 --> 02:41:28.674
<v Speaker 3>longest time I was getting like little </v>
<v Speaker 3>fragments of information from these </v>

3476
02:41:32.551 --> 02:41:34.650
<v Speaker 3>television shows and a lot of them were </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible.</v>

3477
02:41:34.860 --> 02:41:38.220
<v Speaker 3>I'd watch a lot of hunting shows and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they would be like real rednecky,</v>

3478
02:41:38.221 --> 02:41:42.450
<v Speaker 3>low brow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really fucking Yoko dumb dumbs.</v>

3479
02:41:42.710 --> 02:41:43.381
<v Speaker 3>And I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3480
02:41:43.381 --> 02:41:45.240
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be involved in that.</v>

3481
02:41:45.630 --> 02:41:48.240
<v Speaker 3>And then I found Rinella show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was the first thing that opened</v>

3482
02:41:48.241 --> 02:41:49.080
<v Speaker 3>my eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3483
02:41:49.081 --> 02:41:50.250
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

3484
02:41:50.251 --> 02:41:51.084
<v Speaker 3>here's a guy who really smart and well </v>
<v Speaker 3>read and cooks all these things and he </v>

3485
02:41:56.371 --> 02:41:59.550
<v Speaker 3>cooks all these animals in this really </v>
<v Speaker 3>delicious preparation.</v>

3486
02:41:59.551 --> 02:42:00.384
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3487
02:42:00.690 --> 02:42:01.523
<v Speaker 3>now I'm intrigued.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Luckily I got to meet him and </v>

3488
02:42:03.421 --> 02:42:05.920
<v Speaker 3>luckily it started me on this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

3489
02:42:05.960 --> 02:42:06.793
<v Speaker 3>this journey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for most people they're stuck with </v>

3490
02:42:10.321 --> 02:42:13.290
<v Speaker 3>that wolverine movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're stuck with that image.</v>

3491
02:42:13.310 --> 02:42:13.920
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3492
02:42:13.920 --> 02:42:17.480
<v Speaker 4>and being involved in this for so long I</v>
<v Speaker 4>can say.</v>

3493
02:42:18.140 --> 02:42:19.010
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3494
02:42:19.310 --> 02:42:21.590
<v Speaker 4>I do a lot of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3495
02:42:21.650 --> 02:42:24.860
<v Speaker 4>the ultra running community is not a </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunters.</v>

3496
02:42:24.980 --> 02:42:28.010
<v Speaker 4>I mean those are pretty green people and</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3497
02:42:28.730 --> 02:42:32.630
<v Speaker 4>but I can say that for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best people I know,</v>

3498
02:42:32.631 --> 02:42:35.120
<v Speaker 4>my closest friends and people I can </v>
<v Speaker 4>count on for anything,</v>

3499
02:42:35.121 --> 02:42:38.990
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our hunters and it's like hunters,</v>

3500
02:42:38.991 --> 02:42:43.991
<v Speaker 4>I think just have a different </v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective on life or death struggle.</v>

3501
02:42:45.650 --> 02:42:49.010
<v Speaker 4>And where that's driven home for me is </v>
<v Speaker 4>the death threats.</v>

3502
02:42:49.011 --> 02:42:49.844
<v Speaker 4>I get there's comments right now on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a couple of my photos from people </v>

3503
02:42:53.721 --> 02:42:56.600
<v Speaker 4>that said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody said they hope I.</v>

3504
02:42:57.020 --> 02:42:57.853
<v Speaker 4>I get home and my family gets in a car </v>
<v Speaker 4>crash and I get there just isn't enough </v>

3505
02:43:03.711 --> 02:43:07.860
<v Speaker 4>time to where the flames are burning </v>
<v Speaker 4>them and their client that the windows.</v>

3506
02:43:09.650 --> 02:43:12.160
<v Speaker 4>That's the kind of stuff people post on </v>
<v Speaker 4>my photos</v>

3507
02:43:12.370 --> 02:43:16.630
<v Speaker 2>today because I hunt hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

3508
02:43:16.631 --> 02:43:18.340
<v Speaker 2>is that person eating a cheeseburger </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now?</v>

3509
02:43:18.370 --> 02:43:20.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just are they?</v>

3510
02:43:20.471 --> 02:43:23.140
<v Speaker 2>Are they buying their calf than chicken?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3511
02:43:23.141 --> 02:43:24.400
<v Speaker 2>but they're just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're weak.</v>

3512
02:43:24.401 --> 02:43:29.401
<v Speaker 2>People that don't understand that how </v>
<v Speaker 2>life works.</v>

3513
02:43:29.920 --> 02:43:32.740
<v Speaker 2>Hunters understand the preciousness of </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

3514
02:43:32.920 --> 02:43:36.760
<v Speaker 2>We take life to sustain ourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We accept that fact,</v>

3515
02:43:37.090 --> 02:43:39.790
<v Speaker 2>so we appreciate life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We appreciate friendship.</v>

3516
02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:44.200
<v Speaker 2>We appreciate somebody who's there for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you because you've been down,</v>

3517
02:43:44.201 --> 02:43:47.560
<v Speaker 2>you've been up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've killed animals.</v>

3518
02:43:47.650 --> 02:43:51.070
<v Speaker 2>You know what goes into to eating and </v>
<v Speaker 2>surviving.</v>

3519
02:43:51.730 --> 02:43:55.540
<v Speaker 2>Somebody like that puts on the blinders </v>
<v Speaker 2>judges.</v>

3520
02:43:55.541 --> 02:43:56.374
<v Speaker 2>People wants my family to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't even really what they're </v>

3521
02:44:00.341 --> 02:44:01.690
<v Speaker 2>doing is just trying to hurt your </v>
<v Speaker 2>feelings,</v>

3522
02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:04.480
<v Speaker 2>but hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what I'm saying.</v>

3523
02:44:05.180 --> 02:44:07.090
<v Speaker 2>Hunters won't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hunters are,</v>

3524
02:44:08.350 --> 02:44:09.183
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

3525
02:44:09.280 --> 02:44:10.113
<v Speaker 3>I think we can generalize because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some hunters that are pieces of </v>

3526
02:44:12.051 --> 02:44:12.800
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3527
02:44:12.800 --> 02:44:17.270
<v Speaker 3>it's like I know are hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you know some of the best hunters.</v>

3528
02:44:17.370 --> 02:44:19.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's when you get to the elite</v>

3529
02:44:20.030 --> 02:44:20.863
<v Speaker 3>of anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get to people that have exceptional </v>

3530
02:44:22.551 --> 02:44:23.384
<v Speaker 3>character that have allowed them to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>really truly great at any pursuit and </v>

3531
02:44:27.711 --> 02:44:30.500
<v Speaker 3>now you're talking about guys like Leila</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kosky or Remy Warren.</v>

3532
02:44:30.501 --> 02:44:32.090
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about the elite of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>elite,</v>

3533
02:44:32.120 --> 02:44:32.953
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they were doing anything that would </v>

3534
02:44:34.131 --> 02:44:34.964
<v Speaker 3>be amazing at it and I think that when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about the character of </v>

3535
02:44:37.671 --> 02:44:38.504
<v Speaker 3>those people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are people that have overcome </v>

3536
02:44:39.831 --> 02:44:43.640
<v Speaker 3>incredible odds to become very good at </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that's insanely difficult,</v>

3537
02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.910
<v Speaker 3>which is bow hunting and I think a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of these people.</v>

3538
02:44:46.911 --> 02:44:48.680
<v Speaker 3>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

3539
02:44:48.681 --> 02:44:50.490
<v Speaker 3>there's an anonymous communication on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Internet.</v>

3540
02:44:50.520 --> 02:44:51.353
<v Speaker 3>That's a problem.</v>

3541
02:44:51.380 --> 02:44:53.660
<v Speaker 3>The problem is talking to people in </v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

3542
02:44:53.900 --> 02:44:56.660
<v Speaker 3>You get social cues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I say something mean to you and I see</v>

3543
02:44:56.661 --> 02:44:58.370
<v Speaker 3>I hurt your feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel it.</v>

3544
02:44:58.790 --> 02:45:00.620
<v Speaker 3>You trying to like reach out and hurt </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone.</v>

3545
02:45:00.621 --> 02:45:02.180
<v Speaker 3>You're not even in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're throwing a ball,</v>

3546
02:45:02.210 --> 02:45:05.120
<v Speaker 3>you're like closing your eyes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're on a bomb over a bridge,</v>

3547
02:45:05.260 --> 02:45:07.340
<v Speaker 3>you know you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not seeing them.</v>

3548
02:45:07.370 --> 02:45:08.300
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

3549
02:45:08.360 --> 02:45:09.193
<v Speaker 3>It's a bad form of communication for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>human animal because unless you commit </v>

3550
02:45:14.090 --> 02:45:19.090
<v Speaker 3>to only being nice and kind or friendly </v>
<v Speaker 3>or or funny online,</v>

3551
02:45:19.770 --> 02:45:20.603
<v Speaker 3>unless you commit to doing that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>never trying to like reach out and add </v>

3552
02:45:23.300 --> 02:45:24.133
<v Speaker 3>attack someone and hurt someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're using this whole thing wrong </v>

3553
02:45:27.351 --> 02:45:28.184
<v Speaker 3>because you're taking advantage of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird little loophole that existed in </v>

3554
02:45:30.321 --> 02:45:31.154
<v Speaker 3>communication where you can communicate </v>
<v Speaker 3>with someone with no repercussions </v>

3555
02:45:33.890 --> 02:45:35.570
<v Speaker 3>because if someone said that in front of</v>
<v Speaker 3>your face,</v>

3556
02:45:35.630 --> 02:45:36.920
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they never would though.</v>

3557
02:45:36.950 --> 02:45:38.600
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if they did,</v>

3558
02:45:38.680 --> 02:45:40.730
<v Speaker 3>you know it would get fucking hot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3559
02:45:40.920 --> 02:45:42.470
<v Speaker 3>If someone said that to me in front of </v>
<v Speaker 3>my face,</v>

3560
02:45:42.710 --> 02:45:44.870
<v Speaker 3>it would be very hard for me to stop </v>
<v Speaker 3>from assaulting them.</v>

3561
02:45:45.060 --> 02:45:49.860
<v Speaker 2>It just seems weird that hunters don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>go to to a Vegan.</v>

3562
02:45:50.500 --> 02:45:51.333
<v Speaker 2>How do you know if they have pages?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I assume they have pages and just talk </v>

3563
02:45:53.740 --> 02:45:55.110
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tons of them.</v>

3564
02:45:55.160 --> 02:45:57.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we won't do that.</v>

3565
02:45:57.580 --> 02:45:58.413
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3566
02:45:58.570 --> 02:45:59.403
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not something they're not doing </v>

3567
02:46:01.811 --> 02:46:05.140
<v Speaker 3>anything that we oppose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3568
02:46:05.200 --> 02:46:07.150
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't oppose people eating vegetables.</v>

3569
02:46:07.151 --> 02:46:07.984
<v Speaker 3>I eat vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They in their mind that we are doing </v>

3570
02:46:12.351 --> 02:46:13.184
<v Speaker 3>something that is immoral or that is on </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolve and I think that's just </v>

3571
02:46:17.811 --> 02:46:18.644
<v Speaker 3>ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't understand that we are here </v>

3572
02:46:20.091 --> 02:46:20.924
<v Speaker 3>for a very temporary short amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and the more we embrace the </v>

3573
02:46:25.101 --> 02:46:30.101
<v Speaker 3>richness and complexity that is life in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the life eats life struggle and the last</v>

3574
02:46:31.761 --> 02:46:35.180
<v Speaker 3>we fingerpoint and more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We try to look at our own footprint,</v>

3575
02:46:35.181 --> 02:46:39.530
<v Speaker 3>our carbon footprint and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sustainability footprint that we live,</v>

3576
02:46:39.740 --> 02:46:42.080
<v Speaker 3>that we leave on this world and in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>eyes,</v>

3577
02:46:42.350 --> 02:46:43.183
<v Speaker 3>there's no more sustainable way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>living than supporting conservation </v>

3578
02:46:47.270 --> 02:46:51.380
<v Speaker 3>through buying tags and supporting it </v>
<v Speaker 3>through buying outdoor equipment,</v>

3579
02:46:51.381 --> 02:46:52.214
<v Speaker 3>which what is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the number of percentage of </v>

3580
02:46:53.121 --> 02:46:53.954
<v Speaker 3>taxes that go from when you buy hunting </v>
<v Speaker 3>equipment that goes straight to </v>

3581
02:46:57.051 --> 02:46:57.884
<v Speaker 3>conservation.</v>

3582
02:46:57.930 --> 02:46:59.750
<v Speaker 3>It's like 11 percent I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

3583
02:46:59.751 --> 02:47:00.584
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is millions and billions of </v>

3584
02:47:02.510 --> 02:47:04.940
<v Speaker 3>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Rocky Mountain elk foundation has a</v>

3585
02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:05.833
<v Speaker 3>great bunch of charts that show how much</v>
<v Speaker 3>money each year hunters to contributing </v>

3586
02:47:11.570 --> 02:47:13.580
<v Speaker 3>to wildlife conservation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's stunning.</v>

3587
02:47:13.710 --> 02:47:14.543
<v Speaker 3>It's billions of dollars and it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>number one in conservation by a fucking </v>

3588
02:47:18.710 --> 02:47:19.900
<v Speaker 3>long shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3589
02:47:19.910 --> 02:47:20.743
<v Speaker 3>it's the second place is like a tiny </v>
<v Speaker 3>fraction of what hunting contributes to </v>

3590
02:47:26.331 --> 02:47:27.470
<v Speaker 3>conservation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3591
02:47:27.740 --> 02:47:29.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people don't know that.</v>

3592
02:47:29.630 --> 02:47:32.480
<v Speaker 3>It takes these kinds of conversations </v>
<v Speaker 3>for people to find out.</v>

3593
02:47:32.530 --> 02:47:33.363
<v Speaker 3>The hunters know that hunters do know </v>
<v Speaker 3>that his gun and ammo taxes result in </v>

3594
02:47:37.041 --> 02:47:41.420
<v Speaker 3>one point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>1 billion for world war for wildlife and</v>

3595
02:47:41.421 --> 02:47:42.254
<v Speaker 3>conservation each year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One point 1 billion that's just gun and </v>

3596
02:47:47.750 --> 02:47:48.583
<v Speaker 3>ammo taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forget about bows and arrows and a </v>

3597
02:47:52.970 --> 02:47:53.803
<v Speaker 3>hunting equipment and clothing and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the different factors that play in </v>

3598
02:47:59.360 --> 02:48:01.670
<v Speaker 3>different pieces that contribute to </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservation.</v>

3599
02:48:01.671 --> 02:48:02.504
<v Speaker 3>It's an amazing amount and you're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting that from people who are </v>

3600
02:48:06.171 --> 02:48:08.990
<v Speaker 3>philanthropists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not getting that from people that</v>

3601
02:48:08.991 --> 02:48:11.180
<v Speaker 3>just want to be nice and contribute to </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>

3602
02:48:11.300 --> 02:48:12.930
<v Speaker 3>You get a tiny fraction of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep,</v>

3603
02:48:13.240 --> 02:48:17.170
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know that whole thing.</v>

3604
02:48:17.171 --> 02:48:18.910
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation,</v>

3605
02:48:18.911 --> 02:48:23.911
<v Speaker 2>they came up with the hunting is </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservation and it's like a little part</v>

3606
02:48:24.311 --> 02:48:26.140
<v Speaker 2>of that though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I hunt,</v>

3607
02:48:26.770 --> 02:48:28.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I'm going to go out here </v>
<v Speaker 2>and conserve,</v>

3608
02:48:29.080 --> 02:48:29.913
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I want to kill a mature animal </v>

3609
02:48:31.580 --> 02:48:32.413
<v Speaker 2>or take me home to my family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The byproduct of what we do is </v>

3610
02:48:34.451 --> 02:48:35.284
<v Speaker 2>conservation and that's where that money</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes in and that's where the hunt </v>

3611
02:48:38.530 --> 02:48:39.363
<v Speaker 2>hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3612
02:48:39.410 --> 02:48:42.850
<v Speaker 2>buying the hunting licenses and honey </v>
<v Speaker 2>tags because people have told me,</v>

3613
02:48:43.180 --> 02:48:44.320
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

3614
02:48:44.570 --> 02:48:45.403
<v Speaker 2>are you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're taking credit for being a </v>

3615
02:48:47.441 --> 02:48:51.070
<v Speaker 2>conservationist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but would you do that if you didn't have</v>

3616
02:48:51.071 --> 02:48:52.240
<v Speaker 2>to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

3617
02:48:52.630 --> 02:48:55.750
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter my money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my money is there.</v>

3618
02:48:55.751 --> 02:48:57.550
<v Speaker 2>Whether I won,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would do it or not.</v>

3619
02:48:57.560 --> 02:48:57.680
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

3620
02:48:57.680 --> 02:49:00.980
<v Speaker 3>also here's an important thing hunters </v>
<v Speaker 3>chose to,</v>

3621
02:49:01.030 --> 02:49:01.863
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to vote to put that amount of money </v>

3622
02:49:03.741 --> 02:49:06.110
<v Speaker 3>towards conservation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is something that nobody fought,</v>

3623
02:49:06.200 --> 02:49:08.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've never fought,</v>

3624
02:49:08.221 --> 02:49:10.080
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's too expensive or this or that.</v>

3625
02:49:10.081 --> 02:49:10.914
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>11.</v>

3626
02:49:11.310 --> 02:49:12.210
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one over money.</v>

3627
02:49:12.540 --> 02:49:13.710
<v Speaker 3>Gladly do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3628
02:49:13.820 --> 02:49:15.330
<v Speaker 3>And it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's like,</v>

3629
02:49:15.630 --> 02:49:16.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

3630
02:49:17.310 --> 02:49:18.143
<v Speaker 3>I'm a hunter first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a conservationist because I'm a </v>

3631
02:49:21.901 --> 02:49:22.734
<v Speaker 3>hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're also a hunter because people </v>

3632
02:49:25.291 --> 02:49:26.124
<v Speaker 3>before you were conservationists and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they made sure that the hunting was </v>

3633
02:49:28.951 --> 02:49:29.784
<v Speaker 3>protected and that you didn't have to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>a conservation is first and then hope </v>

3634
02:49:33.151 --> 02:49:34.940
<v Speaker 3>that your kids are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're excited.</v>

3635
02:49:35.220 --> 02:49:37.740
<v Speaker 3>Could be hunters because the world would</v>
<v Speaker 3>be in more balanced.</v>

3636
02:49:38.040 --> 02:49:40.860
<v Speaker 3>We tied them to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They tied them together and it's,</v>

3637
02:49:40.970 --> 02:49:43.470
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This model's worked so well.</v>

3638
02:49:43.560 --> 02:49:47.130
<v Speaker 3>It does work so well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's been represented so poorly.</v>

3639
02:49:47.131 --> 02:49:49.410
<v Speaker 3>I think up until recently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people just don't,</v>

3640
02:49:49.500 --> 02:49:50.430
<v Speaker 3>haven't understood what.</v>

3641
02:49:50.460 --> 02:49:51.293
<v Speaker 3>I didn't understood what Stan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it was until I became involved in </v>

3642
02:49:53.551 --> 02:49:54.300
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3643
02:49:54.300 --> 02:49:57.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm very thankful for people like you</v>

3644
02:49:57.570 --> 02:49:59.970
<v Speaker 3>and people like Steve Rinella.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That opened the door for me,</v>

3645
02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:04.140
<v Speaker 3>so and then I feel like as much as I </v>
<v Speaker 3>preach about this,</v>

3646
02:50:04.141 --> 02:50:07.050
<v Speaker 3>as much as I'm redundant is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>annoying to a lot of people listening.</v>

3647
02:50:07.560 --> 02:50:08.393
<v Speaker 3>I think I have a responsibility to share</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I've learned and to communicate </v>

3648
02:50:12.871 --> 02:50:14.940
<v Speaker 3>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though people get mad at me.</v>

3649
02:50:15.160 --> 02:50:17.220
<v Speaker 3>You're stope killing animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All caps.</v>

3650
02:50:17.520 --> 02:50:18.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're really mad.</v>

3651
02:50:18.771 --> 02:50:19.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3652
02:50:19.470 --> 02:50:21.960
<v Speaker 3>Go stop eating grain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fuck it if you,</v>

3653
02:50:21.961 --> 02:50:24.060
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the people don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand you go.</v>

3654
02:50:24.480 --> 02:50:25.313
<v Speaker 3>We've talked about this before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at a greenfield after it's </v>

3655
02:50:27.900 --> 02:50:28.890
<v Speaker 3>been plowed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you see?</v>

3656
02:50:28.891 --> 02:50:31.130
<v Speaker 3>Vultures flying over his wit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3657
02:50:31.140 --> 02:50:33.360
<v Speaker 3>Once I combine goes through and gets the</v>
<v Speaker 3>wheat,</v>

3658
02:50:33.540 --> 02:50:37.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's all sorts of dead animals</v>
<v Speaker 3>of vulture buzzards flying around.</v>

3659
02:50:37.500 --> 02:50:40.110
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean even so you drink coffee.</v>

3660
02:50:40.500 --> 02:50:42.780
<v Speaker 3>How do you think that the coffee beans </v>
<v Speaker 3>were?</v>

3661
02:50:42.781 --> 02:50:44.910
<v Speaker 3>Those are grown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no weeds.</v>

3662
02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:45.840
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3663
02:50:46.020 --> 02:50:49.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just there's animals dying </v>
<v Speaker 3>for your coffee,</v>

3664
02:50:49.630 --> 02:50:50.463
<v Speaker 3>get those animals dying for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that the closer we can get </v>

3665
02:50:55.471 --> 02:50:59.440
<v Speaker 3>to a real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>true organic relationship with,</v>

3666
02:50:59.540 --> 02:51:01.020
<v Speaker 3>with life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with all life,</v>

3667
02:51:01.021 --> 02:51:02.550
<v Speaker 3>plant life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3668
02:51:02.580 --> 02:51:04.710
<v Speaker 3>I fucking hate the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pesticides,</v>

3669
02:51:04.920 --> 02:51:05.753
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate the idea that we're spraying </v>

3670
02:51:07.111 --> 02:51:12.111
<v Speaker 3>things on certain plants to kill them so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we can grow other plants like large</v>

3671
02:51:12.811 --> 02:51:15.360
<v Speaker 3>scale agriculture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you look at a giant Cornfield,</v>

3672
02:51:15.960 --> 02:51:18.810
<v Speaker 3>ladies and gentleman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is one of the most unnatural things</v>

3673
02:51:18.811 --> 02:51:19.644
<v Speaker 3>in all of life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it is one of the most weirdest </v>

3674
02:51:22.381 --> 02:51:24.750
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've just accepted as being natural.</v>

3675
02:51:24.960 --> 02:51:25.793
<v Speaker 3>It's not natural and it's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons why they have to dump nitrogen </v>

3676
02:51:28.171 --> 02:51:32.910
<v Speaker 3>into the soil and all kinds of other </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit and pesticides and use roundup and,</v>

3677
02:51:32.920 --> 02:51:33.753
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and use giant machines to grind up all </v>

3678
02:51:35.641 --> 02:51:36.180
<v Speaker 3>this stuff.</v>

3679
02:51:36.180 --> 02:51:38.820
<v Speaker 3>And that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying you shouldn't eat wheat,</v>

3680
02:51:39.030 --> 02:51:43.710
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying all of this is unnatural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cities are unnatural,</v>

3681
02:51:44.040 --> 02:51:44.873
<v Speaker 3>this is unnatural,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the more we understand about the </v>

3682
02:51:48.600 --> 02:51:52.580
<v Speaker 3>true nature of our interactions with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this life that we are,</v>

3683
02:51:52.581 --> 02:51:55.650
<v Speaker 3>we are surrounded with the better off </v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll all be.</v>

3684
02:51:55.770 --> 02:51:59.460
<v Speaker 3>And it doesn't mean finger pointing or </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying that you should watch your family</v>

3685
02:51:59.461 --> 02:52:01.920
<v Speaker 3>die in a fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's not helping anybody.</v>

3686
02:52:01.921 --> 02:52:04.520
<v Speaker 3>They don't understand this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

3687
02:52:04.650 --> 02:52:05.483
<v Speaker 3>it's just digging in on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of the same thing that people </v>

3688
02:52:07.991 --> 02:52:08.824
<v Speaker 3>do in politics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the right hates the left and </v>

3689
02:52:10.871 --> 02:52:11.704
<v Speaker 3>the left hates the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing gets done because everybody's </v>

3690
02:52:13.750 --> 02:52:17.050
<v Speaker 3>just digging in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>supporting their side and it's just,</v>

3691
02:52:17.920 --> 02:52:18.753
<v Speaker 3>we all need to realize that this life </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're experiencing is far more </v>

3692
02:52:22.121 --> 02:52:22.954
<v Speaker 3>nuanced and requires far more research </v>
<v Speaker 3>and far more understanding of all the </v>

3693
02:52:26.621 --> 02:52:27.970
<v Speaker 3>different pieces that are moving.</v>

3694
02:52:28.150 --> 02:52:32.170
<v Speaker 3>That was another great thing about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting trip is I had no idea what,</v>

3695
02:52:32.640 --> 02:52:33.473
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3696
02:52:33.910 --> 02:52:34.743
<v Speaker 3>people were attacking Donald Trump for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for about a week or anybody we're going </v>

3697
02:52:40.620 --> 02:52:44.830
<v Speaker 3>to fight North Korea or didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything is awesome.</v>

3698
02:52:45.130 --> 02:52:45.963
<v Speaker 3>I was just hoping that no one got nuked </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the time that we had no service for </v>

3699
02:52:49.541 --> 02:52:50.374
<v Speaker 3>a week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just hoping there wasn't a new </v>

3700
02:52:52.540 --> 02:52:54.670
<v Speaker 3>attack or Kim Jong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uhm,</v>

3701
02:52:54.680 --> 02:52:57.370
<v Speaker 3>didn't shoot a rocket over Japan or </v>
<v Speaker 3>wherever the fuck it was.</v>

3702
02:52:57.400 --> 02:53:00.160
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know any of that and everything</v>
<v Speaker 3>worked out just fine.</v>

3703
02:53:00.161 --> 02:53:03.040
<v Speaker 3>So that was a win win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're here.</v>

3704
02:53:03.250 --> 02:53:04.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
