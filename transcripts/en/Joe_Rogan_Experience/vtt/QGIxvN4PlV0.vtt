1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.630
Damn sam style.
Got Kale in the first round.
Ain't done.
Gonna we're,
we're a,

2
00:00:04.631 --> 00:00:08.610
we're alive.
Sorry,
we're late.
But that's just how shit goes.
Um,

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.760
this is a fight companion podcast.
Have you ever heard one of these before?

4
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.590
Expect chaos.
Expect a lot of talking over.
Expect very little up.

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.320
This is not like a regular podcast.
If you listen to this,
like,
wow,

6
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:21.540
they're going to talk about some cool shit maybe.

7
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.590
But what we're actually doing is watching fights and during the,

8
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.870
during the fights,
while they're playing off live,

9
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.510
we're going to be talking to Eddie Bravo's here.
Edgy.

10
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.450
Thank you for him on a bunch of Niles.
Abi.
Marcus is in this lesson.

11
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.250
Take Fletcher just has entered the domiciles,
the big Tait.

12
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.000
Fletcher hollow more feminine when,

13
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.200
when Brian Town is here,
say hi to the world and find calendar.

14
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.550
I'll do whatever you say.
And Brendan's name,
motherfucking shop is also here.

15
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.680
The fight has already started.

16
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.700
We got three minutes and 30 seconds on the clock left in the round.
First fight,

17
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.350
Maureen Morrows and Valerie and a turno Latino gang banging it is.

18
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.220
This is the first fight.
Uh,
and if you're watching this live,

19
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.610
you will probably be about 10 to 15 seconds behind the actual law.

20
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.440
She shut her lights down for a second there.

21
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.430
That's that weird moment when when someone's legs give out polling,

22
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.960
look at this empty hole.
I like the get

23
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.660
to the baby.
She's trying to catch the half guard did girl on the bottom.

24
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.430
But you know who stopped a chocolate Dell rampage.

25
00:01:39.431 --> 00:01:41.310
Stop check the with elbows to the body.
Remember that.

26
00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:43.480
But from side control like that with a downward elbowed,

27
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.060
I know you don't see that often.

28
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.940
We not supposed to even on the body and not even supposed to throw it out.

29
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:50.850
Now you see knees so stupid from side control.

30
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.510
Can't even throw a downward elbow to the thigh.
No,
12 to six,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

31
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.710
That's so stupid.
It's so super old school.

32
00:01:58.711 --> 00:02:03.060
We have a seat for young Tait Fletcher.
It's an old school rule.
Was it Joe Wic?

33
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.250
Cause they were saying a karate move with ranking.
Right.

34
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.810
This is true story breaking boards 12 to six.

35
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.700
So like that shit so dangerous.

36
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.630
It was actually the athletic commission when John McCarthy met with them.

37
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.960
Big John McCarthy way back in the day.
He told me this,
that they were,

38
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.040
they were so scared because they had seen ESPN like two o'clock in the morning.

39
00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:26.470
White dudes blip breaking cinder blocks with so

40
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.240
many other way though.
And I,
is that the most powerful fucking strike?
Uh,

41
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.900
no.
Like he'll fucking spinning heel and take you into the next,

42
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.600
the same kind of shit.
They break with her shoes with shoe.
It's just not here.

43
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.250
Your heel or shit.
There's nothing tougher than your healing and shit.
Yeah,

44
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.090
your voice doesn't hurt.

45
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.800
Like you can kick someone in the head with your heel and it doesn't hurt like

46
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.690
you,
you break the shit out of your hands.

47
00:02:54.691 --> 00:02:56.850
One is the last time you ever heard of someone breaking their heel by kicking

48
00:02:56.851 --> 00:03:00.340
someone.
Look at this girl has got some pretty clever Jujitsu and the triangle.

49
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.810
<v 1>She's only got the head in there,</v>

50
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:04.770
but this pitch camp bereave Valerie turning a eternal,

51
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.410
I shouldn't say bitch cause I do work for this organization,
not in the protocol.

52
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.390
Be Professional that that's a really weird position.
Hey,
listen,

53
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.620
just control.
It's not necessarily doing anything,

54
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:18.130
but people have gone out from no arm triangles.
That's a fact.

55
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.450
People have gone unconscious and you need to have short legs.

56
00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:25.820
You need something else in those needed an army.
They shouldn't,

57
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.400
should be pushing their own online.

58
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:29.230
You should shut the fuck up right now probably man.

59
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.020
When it comes to touch me again and I know you don't know anything I do.

60
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.590
I don't know,

61
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.280
but you know one thing that does work though is the fucking leg scissors dudes

62
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.990
and people do go to sleep with that leg.
Leg Scissors.
Yeah.
I agree with it.

63
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.820
Even though it is that we're trying is a little different.

64
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.260
Especially at a high level.
There's,
you're not fucking right,
but it is valid.

65
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.040
The turnover,
she had a high level,
which Jujitsu,

66
00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:51.220
I know her striking is really good,
but she could go for Lexus are right here.

67
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:55.660
If she untangled their legs is a different animal under the Chin though.

68
00:03:55.661 --> 00:03:58.330
Look at that.
That's nasty.
She's stretching our neck out.

69
00:03:58.331 --> 00:04:00.770
That is going to be taller after whenever I'm called,

70
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.830
I can't help but if it comes to chin,
it's like pushing too.
She's,

71
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:09.820
she's in trouble.

72
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.460
Anytime I'm caught in something like this and I can't get my head out,

73
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.420
my main goal if I can't get my head out is to do the exact same thing to them

74
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.840
and it's like,
dude,
I got you too crazy.
I just want to let go together.

75
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.340
That's let go together word right out of my mouth and he goes,
this,

76
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.910
this girl is not letting go.
Man.
This is really interesting.

77
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.790
This is a lot of energy on your legs to it is.

78
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.550
It is at least stopping it.
They're not staying on one.
What does,

79
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.460
he was about this.
God,
I'll be fram oil filter.

80
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.710
Oil Change done right.
The Fram Cam Cam,
I appreciate what you were saying.

81
00:04:41.711 --> 00:04:45.040
I missed you or don't.
Don't let him talk Jujitsu.

82
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.860
You don't know fucking Chin before I fight.
I can't.

83
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.850
It's always brought her
coco butter.

84
00:04:54.851 --> 00:04:58.400
Yeah.
Yeah,
the Indians out.
Yeah.

85
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.060
I think you need a bottle opener.
Brothers hold on a second store,

86
00:05:04.061 --> 00:05:07.380
but I didn't say no downward elbows open that can't.
Brian,

87
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.040
you're on the microphone.
You know this is a podcast,

88
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.220
but I'm talking about boy Tait Fletcher.
He and I have a connection.
Abra,

89
00:05:12.221 --> 00:05:16.960
your your boy from Texas.
Uh,
Daniel Jolly.
Prior jogging.

90
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.300
We have a tough,
tough first fights off.

91
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.120
That's a hell of a first fight to give somebody too.
I mean,

92
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.090
they're both newcomers though.
This Canadian kid,

93
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.430
Latvian dude who's like a killer.
They were tough.

94
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.930
I went to college with Dan will tell you that right hand.
Nice.
Right here.

95
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.590
I'll tell you what though,
that girl did recover and that was a funky position.

96
00:05:35.591 --> 00:05:40.000
She had Valerie and
got back up.

97
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:43.001
Man,

98
00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:48.001
I am so fired up for December 12th you guys should all make a point of let's,

99
00:05:48.131 --> 00:05:51.460
let's all try to head out to Vegas for the December 12th event.

100
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.790
That's how mad event dude,
which Chris Weidman,

101
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.960
Chris Weidman takes on Luke.
Robbie Lawler takes on Carlos condit,

102
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.900
Aldo and McGregor,
which probably won't know Lawler conduct's in Australia.
Oh,

103
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.060
that's right.
It's not Lola.
Kind of witness it.
The other Conor Mcgregor,

104
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.810
all this is one of the fight is one of the big fight on that whole hold on that

105
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.000
for you.
Hold on.
That might be right.
[inaudible] Romero.
Is it?

106
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.970
That's a mother fucking to tell you right now,
dude.
We should do,

107
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:25.320
we should do a fight companion from there,
Joe.
Fuck yeah.
On a Friday.
Yeah.
Yeah.

108
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.320
The biggest card of the year would be awesome.
Okay.

109
00:06:30.321 --> 00:06:34.060
Hold on a second.
Exactly what it is.
Okay,
here it is.
Do you do,

110
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.300
do widen rock cold
Connor all down.

111
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:43.090
Yo Omer Marrow Jack,
right?
That's the other big fights
at home.

112
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:47.600
No,
she's January 3rd Brian.
No,
I don't agree with that fight.

113
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.790
Holly Holm fight.
I just don't think that's smart.

114
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.850
I would've gone with a man and Nunez before Holly Holm.

115
00:06:52.851 --> 00:06:57.190
Amanda Nunez look like a bad ass.
Damn McMann.
That's,

116
00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.290
that's more dangerous fighter.
If I'm a fighter,
I get it though.

117
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.150
What do you do?
Like you'll all you're doing,

118
00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:06.770
all you're doing is cause when Rhonda leaves,

119
00:07:06.771 --> 00:07:08.210
you need people to know these other girls.

120
00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:10.670
So basically just putting all these marketing dollars into these girls,

121
00:07:10.671 --> 00:07:12.710
they're going to get their ass whooped.
What are you going to do?

122
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.890
You know what I'm saying?
So at least when the leaves were like,
Oh yeah,

123
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.380
that's all he homes.
She finally got her neck snapped off.

124
00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:26.360
Better stand up than Ronda.
Right.
I disagree.
Not to say.
Not really.

125
00:07:26.361 --> 00:07:29.720
I would say too,
as a boxer,
best boxer in the world,
pride,
however,

126
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.790
in the world for girl as a woman,

127
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.350
but like the deal is is like in boxing it's a lot of point fighting.

128
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.140
It's like point karate and so like is there not power in those hands and Rhonda

129
00:07:39.141 --> 00:07:42.440
has it and Holly's been doing a different kind of sport for a long time.

130
00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:45.530
I agree 100% with take.
Like if it was boxing.
Yeah man.

131
00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:48.500
Now we got to fight the best boxer in the world for women.

132
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:53.380
If Ann Wolfe decides to still not box,
cause an waffle bitches,

133
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.600
she might only be mean.
She might be 40 or whatever the fuck she is.

134
00:07:56.601 --> 00:08:00.230
But if Ann Wolfe decides to run through a training camp,
tell you what man,

135
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.950
that is one check that as a dude,
I would not want to get punched by.

136
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.900
She's ferocious.
Slap a bitch.
I don't care who Ronda fights.
Really.

137
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:13.190
I just want to see her fight.
I just want to see if I tell him you're not here,

138
00:08:13.191 --> 00:08:15.880
you're not going to be interested in excited to be Holly Holm against Rhonda.

139
00:08:15.881 --> 00:08:18.260
Like I want to see it if you demolish her in a minute.

140
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:23.430
But what's like pick up Mike Tyson with uh,

141
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:28.010
Bruce Seldon.
Bruce Seldin Frey Bruno,
uh,

142
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:33.050
Trevor Berbick eggs.
Oh,
those guys,
at least those guys were world class though.

143
00:08:33.051 --> 00:08:34.020
My man,
and it's true.

144
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:40.090
Rhonda combativeness Usain Bolt going to the Special Olympics and attract world

145
00:08:40.251 --> 00:08:44.480
class against opposition.
That was it.
Mike Tyson.
You know what I mean?

146
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.170
Mike Tyson made all those guys.
Never,
never really terrified in the ring.

147
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.690
He went right through them all but looks just like Rhonda.

148
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.470
But they were legit worldclass fighter who seldom there were a lot of them were

149
00:08:54.471 --> 00:08:56.000
former world Bruce to

150
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.110
<v 0>that was legit world class.
You're talking about an Olympian.</v>

151
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.920
They were really good fighters from running.

152
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.960
The real problem with those guys is that they were fighting Tyson.

153
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.950
The real problem with Rhonda is Rhonda is like a Mike Tyson.

154
00:09:07.951 --> 00:09:10.550
She's an elite of the elite girls.

155
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:16.830
Girls are good.
They're good,
they're good,
they're good.

156
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.540
She's great as it goes better than them out there that are among the best that

157
00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:26.070
this is what we got
the best in.
Uh,

158
00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.830
see if you look at,
there's some girls like,

159
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:32.700
I think Amanda Nunez has real potential.
She has real potential.

160
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:37.020
Should never be [inaudible] good day.
Yeah,
she's worldclass right.

161
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.310
Claude you get daily is dangerous.

162
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:43.460
You want to on check worldclass there's a few cyborg steroids are no steroids.

163
00:09:43.981 --> 00:09:45.600
You know,
take away all that controversy.

164
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:49.230
Just go buy based on her performances for Roche is terrifying.

165
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:54.150
Worldclass dangerous fighter.
That's for,
what did she say?
Labor Cyborg.
What?

166
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.790
What's going on with her?
But the lady Shit,
Cyborg,

167
00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.060
whoever the fuck or manager is,
she's a fire.
That person she used to,

168
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.230
she needs to just lose weight,
get on a scale show.
He and I am.

169
00:10:04.231 --> 00:10:08.070
I make one 35 Rhonda.
That bell is my pitch.
That's it.

170
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.880
I'm not going to try and steal your idea.
What about Misha Tate?

171
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:15.090
Cyborg catch weight?
Yeah.
Why the fuck me?
She's not screaming for this.

172
00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.240
Have no idea.
No.
What happened?
Thinking about that.
Fuck a catch weight.

173
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.490
If that chick wants a fight at one 35 proof,

174
00:10:20.491 --> 00:10:24.910
you can make one 35 jumped all over me.
Yeah.

175
00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.793
Cool.

176
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.670
Rousy home and Cyborg Meesha on the same car.
Yes,

177
00:10:35.671 --> 00:10:37.500
because the fans really don't know side.

178
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.860
They really don't know who she don't know and if she goes in there and mops

179
00:10:40.861 --> 00:10:42.210
meets or Tate,
which I don't think she does,

180
00:10:42.211 --> 00:10:46.200
I think she loses him one just saying she could easily lose to Michelle 35

181
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.470
easily.
I think she does one 35 is a different animal for not only that,

182
00:10:49.471 --> 00:10:52.820
it's a different animal now because no ivys the,
Oh,

183
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:56.880
if you get caught with the IB to your band,
homey or ban two year ban,

184
00:10:56.881 --> 00:11:00.540
if you'd use an ivy to rehydrate,
well,
you did a podcast with the guy.

185
00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.560
You have to Wicki.
Nope.
Why you?
How dare all of you.

186
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:09.060
Why do they get good?
He talked about how you get it.

187
00:11:09.061 --> 00:11:12.690
Was He taught,
he address the fact that is dangerous for the fighters were,

188
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:13.980
well he said,

189
00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:17.400
this is actually some studies that show that it's more effective to rehydrate

190
00:11:17.401 --> 00:11:21.330
with water,
with drinking it orally.
I have not looked into that and I,

191
00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.750
but he said,
he said nothing.
Extreme cases of jail.
He goes,

192
00:11:24.751 --> 00:11:26.040
all athletes are extreme.
He goes,

193
00:11:26.041 --> 00:11:29.640
that's for the average person who's being hydrated.
Mouth oral is better,

194
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:33.510
but for extreme cases,
ivs better.
And if you have a doctor's note you can get it.

195
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:38.760
But
I'm a huge Jeff Novitsky.
It's huge fan.

196
00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.340
He's damn,
this dude is legit.
Oh here's a hundred people are fuck.

197
00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:43.950
Oh he busted Lance Armstrong.

198
00:11:43.951 --> 00:11:47.610
He busted while sort of busted Barry bonds because Barry Bonds Guy,

199
00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.790
that was one thing we found out after the podcast.
He's,

200
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.050
he was recently acquitted on all charges.

201
00:11:52.051 --> 00:11:55.480
Like they didn't catch Barry on anything.
Yeah.
They,
it's all like,

202
00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:57.190
they wasted all that money.
He was making it out.

203
00:11:57.191 --> 00:12:00.160
Like it's some big message they were sending to the children.
And I was like,

204
00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:03.610
all right,
whatever would all that.
It's like,
let's not think about kids.

205
00:12:03.611 --> 00:12:08.200
We're talking about adult professional athletes.
Fuck Barry bonds over.

206
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:08.740
Well,

207
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:13.120
what they were doing was they were trying to prosecute with what they do is they

208
00:12:13.121 --> 00:12:14.110
have a mandate.

209
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.140
Someone tells them to prosecute and they have to prosecute on what's up with

210
00:12:17.141 --> 00:12:18.730
that girl's shorts.
By the way,
on the left,

211
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:23.740
it was like a combination of like Thai shorts,
short shorts.

212
00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:27.640
He's got something under him,
Joe.
But under wearing booty shorts under those,

213
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:31.000
what I never understood was why congress cared about steroids.
It's redacted.

214
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:34.420
Never made a tremendous waste of money.
Tax payers,

215
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:36.830
more athletes in the Wicki was very,
uh,

216
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.970
well that's the funniest thing about the congressional thing was listening to

217
00:12:39.971 --> 00:12:44.090
Joe Biden talk about how back when he was an athlete,
you know,

218
00:12:44.091 --> 00:12:48.940
and I always wondered if a guy was on some something.
I'm sure Joe,

219
00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:51.700
my God,
given talent,
like he's so close.

220
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:55.780
Joe Biden's disgusting mention steroids in a state of the union.

221
00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:58.780
People always forget that Joe Biden's a plagiarist by the way.

222
00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.700
They forget the Joe Biden we used to do was show bite on his middle school a

223
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:03.550
exam,
right?
Yeah.
Well,

224
00:13:03.551 --> 00:13:06.880
not just that you plagiarized Kennedy's speeches when he's running for president

225
00:13:06.881 --> 00:13:11.020
back in [inaudible] 88 we were,
when we were at stitches Comedy Club in Boston,

226
00:13:11.021 --> 00:13:14.590
we should do it Joe Biden night in the eighties,
where comics would go up.

227
00:13:14.591 --> 00:13:17.770
Like I would do your material.
You would do my material.
We do each other shit.

228
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:22.300
It's called Joe Biden.
How does someone like that?
How does someone like that?

229
00:13:22.301 --> 00:13:25.330
And someone like Hillary Clinton will not forget about the email stuff,

230
00:13:25.331 --> 00:13:29.130
but all the stuff she did with Bill Clinton with that doubt.
Whitewater style.

231
00:13:29.131 --> 00:13:32.640
Yeah.
Like terrifying.
All that stuff.
That why,
why do you,

232
00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.770
how would they still like candidates to read the book?

233
00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.780
The strain on the death of Vince Foster,

234
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.500
Vince foster was one of the people that was involved in the Whitewater scandal.

235
00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:46.660
Jesus on himself,
uh,
in,
in,
in a park.
Okay.

236
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:51.580
Had his,
the gun still in his hand,
which never fucking happens.
Every,

237
00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:55.000
every single expert will tell you when you shoot yourself in the head,

238
00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:58.660
your body goes by and that gun goes flying.
He's still got the gun in his hand,

239
00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.280
no blood at the scene of the crime.

240
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:04.630
His body had been mulling this hundred percent his body had been moved to spare

241
00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.320
seats.
That ain't even a conspiracy gangster.

242
00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.700
Like that's what gangsters do.

243
00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:11.920
They don't want to just kill a body and have them disappear.

244
00:14:11.921 --> 00:14:14.410
They want to leave a message.
You're going to try to bust us.

245
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.810
We're coming up to you.
Keep the shit out of court or your,

246
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.330
you and your family are dead.
Makes Sense.

247
00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:24.360
Any bravos and just doing it to fuck we garrison beer conspiracy.

248
00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:28.210
That's all the matters.
Kind.
Keep the weeds under wraps,
Jamie,

249
00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:32.530
Hillary Clinton and here we go.

250
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:36.190
The candidates for the presidency of the United States.

251
00:14:36.191 --> 00:14:39.100
How Much Eddie Bravo loves,
loves conspiracy.

252
00:14:39.101 --> 00:14:42.000
These quills girls in full guard and he's not even talking about Jujitsu.

253
00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:45.070
Doesn't give a fuck.
She went up to Michigan draw,
shut the fuck up.

254
00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:54.800
<v 1>Pissed cause I didn't get that.
I don't see.</v>

255
00:14:54.801 --> 00:14:58.280
I don't see why after that Ben Saunders,
fine.
Everybody's not doing that.
Well,

256
00:14:58.281 --> 00:14:59.780
you know what?
I got a message today.

257
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:03.890
It was really interested in the Jiu Jitsu coaches of the MMA camps.

258
00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.800
They decide and they decide what they're going to train it.

259
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:10.550
What was the point of sale if they don't make that decision to stick that into

260
00:15:10.551 --> 00:15:14.980
training.
Let's work a little bit on this.
Uh,
elbows from Michigan troll healers.

261
00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:17.210
They got done.
We just try and do here.

262
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:20.780
She's trying to wrap her leg and sticker her foot underneath the armpit of

263
00:15:20.781 --> 00:15:25.280
Latino who is on the bottom or on the top.
Dude,
I wish she gave up on it,

264
00:15:25.281 --> 00:15:29.210
but look to keep,
oh damn.

265
00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:34.980
Fleas or legs pulled ahead.
She needs to control that and she got caught.

266
00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:40.230
She's got a friend grabbed the head at this point.
Look at Latino,

267
00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:44.600
thinks she's safe by tucking her man.
That shit doesn't work.

268
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:48.340
Especially like this.
Total.
You get the squeeze,
he'll get the squeeze notes.

269
00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.760
I wish in between rounds highlights what already happened.
Oh Wow.
Nice.

270
00:15:52.761 --> 00:15:56.860
Nicest Cape.
I wish they'd show the previous fights.
Quick highlight turtles,

271
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.970
a nasty striker man.
She's got good technique.
You see the way she moves very,

272
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.140
very loose and relax.
Good.

273
00:16:03.141 --> 00:16:07.610
Like like mu variation or speed.
She counters as well too.

274
00:16:07.611 --> 00:16:09.680
She just keeps her head down.
Chin down.
Just

275
00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.930
I think and I'm beginning to listen to nick curse on about this.

276
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:20.110
I think a giant part of what holds fighters bag is strength and conditioning I

277
00:16:20.241 --> 00:16:20.991
think.
What do you mean?

278
00:16:20.991 --> 00:16:24.890
I used to think that it's more important to work on skills than anything and I

279
00:16:24.891 --> 00:16:26.240
think up to a certain point it is,

280
00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:30.920
but now I think what holds people back is like like Latino right now I see a

281
00:16:30.921 --> 00:16:34.640
slower fighter.
Then I saw in the first round we'll see.
I see.
I see.

282
00:16:34.641 --> 00:16:39.080
Like some significant slowing and like she's having a hard time executing.

283
00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:42.800
I agree.
It depends on your skill level.
Yes.
It depends on the skill level.

284
00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:44.380
You should focus more on strength conditioning,

285
00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:46.610
get in shape so we can show your skills for three rounds,

286
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:49.280
two minutes in the first minute,
two minutes of a fight.

287
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:52.160
It's all about your skills,
but then as fights go on,

288
00:16:52.161 --> 00:16:55.640
it's all about how much conditioning do you have in the tank to use those skills

289
00:16:55.700 --> 00:17:00.530
and nerve endings are all about how quickly you can recover and can your body

290
00:17:00.531 --> 00:17:02.520
recover multiple times.
Yup.
Yup.

291
00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:07.810
And you think at an elite level they would be able to go 25 minutes can seem

292
00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:12.680
gas.
They seem a little,
well,
there's slower,
slower for sure,

293
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:17.210
but that's the like dos Anjos um,
when we saw dos Anjos fight pedis,

294
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:20.090
that motherfucker kept that same pace for five rounds.

295
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:24.120
He was guns ablaze and for five rounds we get Demetrius Johnson and gets all the

296
00:17:24.121 --> 00:17:28.700
bag of teen off.
Ali Bag off was on e worked that motherfucker up.

297
00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.760
Tj Dillashaw same thing.
Exactly.
Same thing.

298
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:36.170
You think what he did Atlantic on Borow Tj Dillashaw mighty mouse would happen.

299
00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:40.970
Can't happen.
Big great fight.
And why it's only 20 towns about it.

300
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.460
Mighty mouse is fought one 35.
He fucked Dominique's too.

301
00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:45.080
He lost to Dominick Cruz.
Yep.

302
00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:47.930
I think that Tj Dillashaw is one of the best pound for pound fighters in the

303
00:17:47.931 --> 00:17:50.130
world.
I think these with Hanan.
Barao was

304
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:52.000
<v 0>like a wake up call to everybody.
Yeah,</v>

305
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.110
he beat the fucking shit out of hand and next for me.

306
00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:58.920
He beat the fucking shit out of him.
Like he owned him from the moment.

307
00:17:58.921 --> 00:18:03.240
It wasn't even a fight.
It wasn't a fight.
It was a clinic.
Dominick Cruz,

308
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:06.570
Dominick Cruz,
Cruz need doesn't fall off.

309
00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.190
Everything is knee like race.

310
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:12.360
He breaks his hands all the time so he can't count on that

311
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.590
huge fight.
And Dominick is natural.

312
00:18:16.591 --> 00:18:20.700
He's all natural and he's in his thirties you know and at 135 pounds

313
00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:23.470
traditionally,
especially in boxing,
once you hit the one,

314
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:28.520
the thirties tough NFL running back speed rely on speed and reflexes more than

315
00:18:29.851 --> 00:18:34.170
anybody because they're so fast like mighty mouse and Dodson.
Holy Shit.

316
00:18:34.171 --> 00:18:35.820
That's going to be a bowler.
That fight's going to be

317
00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:43.680
legit threat though.
He's a legit threat.
Dotson can knock out anybody.

318
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.500
He knocked out Tj people don't forget about that on the ultimate fighter.

319
00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:50.160
Fuck yeah he did.
He beat the shit out of Tj.
He did different Tj for sure.

320
00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:53.910
Totally different tea.
Tea.
There's Tj pre and post bang.

321
00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:59.460
True and pre pre cause suggestions.
Cause no one loves fighting more than us.

322
00:18:59.461 --> 00:19:03.220
Right.
But that a fricking Datsun um,

323
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:06.960
John Dotson verse Johnson fights.
It's a tough sell man.

324
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:09.960
Like I'm not like Ooh I can't fucking wait to see them throw down.

325
00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:13.910
It's different.
And those guys are more talented than any cause you're a cyclist.

326
00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:16.360
You might be right.

327
00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:22.250
Hey me and the entire world then a problem cause he's not selling paper view.

328
00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:26.330
We've got another round.
Are his shows among the worst sizes.

329
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.540
Those just new like real bad.
Not Good.
It's tough man.
He's those talents.

330
00:19:30.541 --> 00:19:32.250
Again in the UFC it's just people,

331
00:19:32.251 --> 00:19:35.130
it's hard for you to jump on board on a small guy like he got,

332
00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.930
he got denied access to the club.

333
00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.170
He's the fricking multiple time world champion in the UFC.

334
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:43.620
They thought he was 15 at a height limit.
I don't know.

335
00:19:43.621 --> 00:19:45.420
There's just a lot of people that didn't know who he was.

336
00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:49.200
You know those lines in Vegas.
Nobody gets in those phones.
They recognize him.

337
00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.820
Yeah.
They didn't recognize him.
Yeah.
Those lines of bummer man.

338
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:57.540
Cause he's so talented.
He needs a couple more good fights like Dodson.

339
00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.740
He needs an arch rival.
Can you tell when you're talking shit,

340
00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:02.800
the whole gets a Conor Mcgregor won 25 he never sinned.
Felder.

341
00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:07.850
Holy Shit fight or I'm a huge fan of that dude.
He's opposed.

342
00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:12.400
Fuck.
He's fun to watch.
Throws strikes from everyone,
especially after that bar,

343
00:20:12.401 --> 00:20:16.710
but it was a fight.
God,
Oh she got,
she got it.
The fact that he didn't he,

344
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:18.780
he went the distance with them.
Oh yeah.

345
00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:22.500
Losses with them and Barboza was kicking the shit and switch,

346
00:20:22.501 --> 00:20:26.400
kick that switch keys.
The fastest switchgear guy I've ever seen ever in my life,

347
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:27.840
ever.
Ever,
ever.

348
00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:31.980
Remember Jamie Varner was talking about how before and he beat him,

349
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:36.220
but before that he was the most scared he's ever been before a fight.
Yeah.

350
00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:41.250
That's a scary Barboza.
Joe Silva calls you and said you want Barboza.

351
00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.850
There's a couple of guys where you get that call.
You're like,
yeah,

352
00:20:44.851 --> 00:20:48.010
I guess I'll think about that.
Terry.
Adam,
fight without wheel kick

353
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:51.200
<v 1>to the head first wheel kick,
k on the opposite.
You got to fight them next.
Yeah.</v>

354
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:55.510
Jails,
his kicks.
He's the only guy I've ever stopped to fighters with leg kicks.

355
00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.920
He's nasty.
Mike Lulo and fail Oliveira both with leg kicks.

356
00:20:59.921 --> 00:21:03.700
I'm not going to wrap the guy out,
but super high level guy,
super high level guy.

357
00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:06.280
My manager goes,
Brendan,
I want you in on this call.

358
00:21:06.281 --> 00:21:09.910
This is the best part of my job.
Watch this broke.
Just got this huge fight.

359
00:21:09.911 --> 00:21:12.970
Announced me six and just Silva.
Watch this.
We're in a hotel.

360
00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:17.320
Calls him on speed dial.
He goes,
my man got to fight for you.

361
00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:18.660
Who said this?

362
00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:23.660
Alexandra Gustafson September or whatever and he's all white and the guy goes,

363
00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:29.140
ah shit.
Really?
He goes,
yeah man.
He goes,
AH,
fuck.

364
00:21:29.141 --> 00:21:34.030
Well let's get this paper.
Hangs up the phone.
My managers all off.
Fuck man,

365
00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.530
I don't want your boy's going to lose for sure.

366
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:44.320
Ah Fuck.
How do I solve that?
Can't tell you man.

367
00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:46.870
I'm not going to sell the guy out.
Big Long Tall motherfucker.

368
00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:51.300
And how long ago was this?
It was TJ before they weight classes is Tj Dillashaw.

369
00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:57.130
It was so funny,
man.
In Japan.
He was so heartbroken.
That's crazy.
Yeah.

370
00:21:57.131 --> 00:22:00.070
When you,
that's the thing about the UFC and MMA in general,

371
00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:04.480
like there's a lot of fighters that they jump into the UFC and they are starting

372
00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:05.530
to have some success.
Well,

373
00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:10.090
there's a very short climb until you're in worldclass territory and if you beat

374
00:22:10.091 --> 00:22:14.380
one of those motherfuckers off to the races a year,
you shop style,
urine,

375
00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:18.860
be shopstyle Chris touch your shirt and they're like,
oh cool.
Here's Gonzaga.

376
00:22:18.861 --> 00:22:22.470
I was like,
holy fuck man.
Easy Bro.
I fights.

377
00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:28.690
Is that Brad?
What was that?
Stanley Grad.
Dallas.
Tampa.
He's,

378
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:32.300
excuse me,
Susan affliction.
Sure.
Anything.

379
00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:37.130
Boy Damn it.
It's about ice and there's a black puck,
I think they call us.

380
00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.560
You got to get it in the net and when they do live,
when you see a loss.

381
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:45.640
This is a dope CA's amazing.
No,
no.
Tony.

382
00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:49.690
Tony Sims is from Denver.
He's older.
He's been boxing since he was like six.

383
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:53.620
He got in the UFC super late,
man.
This is second short fight in a row.

384
00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:57.310
I'm telling you,
this kid is a monster.
Tough fight.
Familiar.
Either way.
Hey,

385
00:22:57.311 --> 00:23:00.940
give me one of them beers there,
Mr. Keller.
Yeah,
sure.
Mine a little wobbly.

386
00:23:00.941 --> 00:23:05.770
Pop County.
You'll hear me going.
Well Uva,
I'm excited about this main event,
man.

387
00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:09.340
We got the bed on the main event or what bro?
You are.
No,

388
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:13.840
that's illegal.
No,
we did co main event.
I got Neil magna.
You got your Silva.

389
00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:15.850
Remember honey,
Dick,
me man.
Doesn't matter.

390
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.200
Hold on now you people listening to this don't know what we're talking about

391
00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.050
because we are,
we had this discussion before the podcast,

392
00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:26.310
but Brennan Shab sent me a photo and a,

393
00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:31.270
I'm going to take this photo and I'm going to um,
uh,
I'll,

394
00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:34.390
I'll show it to you guys,
but this is the,
the difference.

395
00:23:34.391 --> 00:23:35.740
You could find this photo online.

396
00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.380
This is the difference between Eric Silva a while ago and Eric Sylvan.

397
00:23:40.381 --> 00:23:44.370
Now a fan sent that to me
should be banned.

398
00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:49.370
Look at the photo on the top.
That's him now lead the photo in the bottle.

399
00:23:49.371 --> 00:23:53.320
I got honey.
Dick,
can I see this?
Is this?

400
00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:58.310
Oh God,
no,
that was great.

401
00:23:58.311 --> 00:24:00.770
That was good reaction and a laptop.

402
00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:04.850
I'm thinking about getting a new laptop and I mean,
I'm really thinking,
oh no,

403
00:24:04.851 --> 00:24:06.170
that's $1,500.

404
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:11.390
Would you say Jamie picture?
Anyway,

405
00:24:11.391 --> 00:24:16.391
so the suggestion is that it's possible that Eric silver may or may not have

406
00:24:17.301 --> 00:24:21.050
been.
Oh,
it looks like I got lucky here.
Ooh,
good Lord.
What a difference.

407
00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:25.280
It only got on my screen.
God,
I all I know is I'm getting on the old DRT.

408
00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:29.540
They tell you,
you're still not going to look like no.
I want to have his hair.

409
00:24:29.541 --> 00:24:32.260
I'll tell you that I'm already 80.
You should have done it in the sec guys.

410
00:24:32.261 --> 00:24:34.850
I've been taken,
um,
create a team.
That's why it looked thicker.

411
00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:39.780
He has been taking creatine.
Yup.
Well that stuff works.
It does.

412
00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:44.520
It makes your face fat does add water weight in my face.
Tell him thank you.

413
00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:49.100
It's my face.
Five pounds of face.

414
00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:55.960
That is a remarkable difference.
I guess he's just not working out as hard.
Um,
um,

415
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.270
that's it for sure.
Changes is eating more fatty foods.

416
00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:04.280
Maybe more outside you or some shit.
The more I say,
either way,

417
00:25:04.281 --> 00:25:08.000
Eddie can't back out now.
Honey.
Dick Neil,
Mag d,

418
00:25:08.001 --> 00:25:09.570
he took the fight on two weeks notice,

419
00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:14.810
decided if I think Eddie is allowed the back off before the fight actually

420
00:25:14.811 --> 00:25:17.330
starts.
You know what I'm asking you guys exchanged money,

421
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:19.620
even with your steroids.
I'm going to do it.
We're going hunting.

422
00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.420
I'm going to go with her honey decor.
Notice how he's hunted or sterilized.

423
00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:28.070
I'm the dealer,
so
we'll do it.
It's all how you feel,

424
00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.790
but you don't sign it.
I,
I actually,
uh,
you know Eric Sheila was the favorite.

425
00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:34.910
Yeah,
but he looks soft now

426
00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.950
and that's because he's still a cutie pie.
You already had a problem with cardio,

427
00:25:39.951 --> 00:25:42.530
right?
Yes.
He's a module at first round.

428
00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.710
He's a ferocious guy and he'd be expends a lot of energy.

429
00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:48.360
And when you fight a guy like Matt Brown that she does not recommend,

430
00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:48.951
who would you take?

431
00:25:48.951 --> 00:25:51.710
If you had to bet the last thing you want to do is be drained.
If you had to bet,

432
00:25:51.711 --> 00:25:53.000
who did you take?
Right?
Magni.

433
00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:56.600
I like magnet in that fight because I think magna is more consistent and Maggie

434
00:25:56.601 --> 00:25:59.690
has great endurance and Maggie's only problem that he's shown inside the octagon

435
00:25:59.691 --> 00:26:01.190
of all is dealing with Damien.

436
00:26:01.191 --> 00:26:04.780
Motherfucker beat down south director.

437
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:08.840
He's a constructor that's like you're a chained up sheep.

438
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:13.870
Matt and his fucking giant anacondas wrapping its body at reunion squeezing as

439
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:16.220
well.
Who Do you have in the main event?
Eddie?

440
00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:21.730
I had a Holloway but he didn't want to like is a beast.

441
00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:25.820
Okay,
I disagree.
I got all of era.
You got $1,000 yeah,

442
00:26:25.821 --> 00:26:28.640
I do have $1,000 why don't you bet Brian Kelly wealthy?

443
00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:35.120
I'll take the bad just to make the podcast more excited.

444
00:26:35.121 --> 00:26:37.760
I don't want to take $1,000 from a good friend,

445
00:26:37.761 --> 00:26:41.450
but I'll bet you 20 bucks so I could win.
All right.
What are we betting?

446
00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:46.230
Why can't ours?
Well,
how about we get out of here?
Yeah,

447
00:26:46.231 --> 00:26:49.350
let's do dinner.
That's a good call.
I got to make sure I can do that.

448
00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:52.320
We'll go get some state.
We've got to make sure isn't that cross?
We're married.

449
00:26:52.321 --> 00:26:55.160
We have kids that this is bullshit.

450
00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:58.920
We're not even masters of our own domain.
It's true.

451
00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:02.310
I got to see if I got to see if I can do what I want to do.

452
00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:05.820
I know because my boss,
I have to check in with the boss.
She's so awesome.

453
00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:09.260
She lets me do everything.
So yeah,
no,
I get that.
Yeah,

454
00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:14.670
we're all night except having dinner on Sundays.
You kind of got to,
I understand.

455
00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:18.690
Put it in your time.
All right,
so we can make it 20 bucks now we'll go to dinner.

456
00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:23.790
Um,
all right.
I got back.
I got bullied into dinner.
I have to pay now,

457
00:27:23.791 --> 00:27:26.520
but don't get me wrong.
Max Holloway can win and I would not be,

458
00:27:26.521 --> 00:27:29.370
she's the favorite.
I wouldn't be so Izzy.
He's the favorite.
What am I?

459
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:33.550
Who am I t I disagree with.
It's a close fight.
I think it's a close fight.
I,

460
00:27:33.551 --> 00:27:35.460
this is,
this is my take on it.

461
00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.640
I think that all Avera is a little more tactical,

462
00:27:38.641 --> 00:27:40.830
both standing up and on the ground that are on the ground.
I agree.

463
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:42.090
I'll switch it up.
You want.

464
00:27:42.091 --> 00:27:45.630
I'll take all of her events standing on a switch up the bet.
Switch it up.

465
00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:50.710
Double or nothing.
I'll forget about the Eric Silva.
Well,
that one's fine.
Well,

466
00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:52.100
let's see how the variable doesn't.

467
00:27:52.101 --> 00:27:56.310
All of air like kinda wouldn't he be kind of flubby too?
What do you mean flubby?

468
00:27:56.370 --> 00:28:00.720
Yeah.
Oliveira no,
wait.
What's flubby basically these are not gonna look the same.

469
00:28:00.721 --> 00:28:04.990
You're saying?
Yes.
Nah,
he's a really skinny guy.
He's thin.
Yeah.
He's,

470
00:28:04.991 --> 00:28:07.020
it doesn't look like a real void right at all.

471
00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:12.030
He actually dropped down from 55 to 45 read it.
Yeah.

472
00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:15.050
I don't think he's a steroid use.
You want to switch it up to take Holloway?
Well,

473
00:28:15.051 --> 00:28:17.150
let's,
let's see how old the Neil back the fight.

474
00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:21.150
We'll do double or nothing and not take stick with Holloway is before we,

475
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:22.320
before I ask you this way,

476
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.740
he wanted to ask you this question before I asked you this question.

477
00:28:25.741 --> 00:28:30.741
Let's think about the possibility of the MMA media out of proportion because

478
00:28:31.471 --> 00:28:34.830
they owe TMZ.
What?
What it is TMZ now,
right?

479
00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:39.150
[inaudible] we had seven different articles,

480
00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:44.070
dude stone talking shit.
I snapshot centered.
A Rhogam went,

481
00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:48.630
oh shit.
I said,
fuck.
Now here's the question.

482
00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:54.120
Percentage of the Brazilian Jujitsu fighters or Brazilian MMA fighters you think

483
00:28:54.121 --> 00:28:58.660
are on steroids.
If you had to guess free thing,
we're not face

484
00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:03.960
to start installing.
You know what?
I don't want to just single out Brazilians.

485
00:29:03.961 --> 00:29:08.340
I think a majority of the guys are a majority.
A lot of the Brazilians,

486
00:29:08.341 --> 00:29:11.680
so you think it's 90% of all the MMA fighters are on steroids,

487
00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:15.480
the correct Brazilians do you think are not on steroids?
Wow,

488
00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:20.430
that's a good question.
Which ones are not Nogueira for sure,
right?

489
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.050
Noguera he's not.
Why?

490
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:28.380
I said why do you look that you've seen of ghost little nug.

491
00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:31.770
That's not dead.
He gets me in trouble,
man

492
00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:38.670
thing last time it wasn't me
so bad.

493
00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:41.140
No,
Sarah sat feels really,
really bad for that.

494
00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:44.710
I understand the thing about it or hear it on steroids.

495
00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.680
The understated thing about the steroids is the mental aspect.

496
00:29:47.681 --> 00:29:51.340
Like these fighters aren't coming out as aggressive like silver as a destroyer

497
00:29:51.341 --> 00:29:54.160
normally,
but let's say he was on tier.
What's it going to be now?

498
00:29:54.161 --> 00:29:58.210
Is he going to be a little more passive?
It's not just the body,
it's the line.

499
00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:02.460
He will rely on that test doc whenever it came from,
from some pride.
Right.

500
00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:04.960
And everybody would like pride is the killers were like,

501
00:30:04.961 --> 00:30:07.300
that's the better show than the UFC athletes.

502
00:30:07.301 --> 00:30:09.280
What they all came and got beat up by,

503
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:12.970
by guys that weren't top tier guys in the UFC.
Every one of those pride athletes.

504
00:30:12.971 --> 00:30:17.830
True.
And that's all,
that's all due to drugs.
And that's not abilities or uh,

505
00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:21.020
or strength even I think,
I think it's exactly what Aubrey is saying.
It's there.

506
00:30:21.021 --> 00:30:24.040
They're like,
who am I without?
This cannot only that,

507
00:30:24.041 --> 00:30:25.690
these guys weren't doing it properly.

508
00:30:25.691 --> 00:30:29.560
I'm sure they didn't take enough time to recover and get their natural test

509
00:30:29.561 --> 00:30:32.860
level.
So they're probably compromised.
So not only would they not on steroids,

510
00:30:32.861 --> 00:30:35.870
they are compromised.
Because when you look at some of those guys in pride,

511
00:30:35.871 --> 00:30:39.640
we don't need to name names,
we don't need to name names.
But when they came over,

512
00:30:39.641 --> 00:30:43.840
they looked physically different.
They look physically different.
You know,
I mean,

513
00:30:43.841 --> 00:30:46.960
look at Cro cop.
Here's a perfect advantage example.

514
00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:49.980
Cro Cop was a god damn destroyer.
I mean you look at some of the,
the,

515
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:52.240
the fights that he had,
the wear and tear,

516
00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:55.360
there's a lot going on but he just was a different guy.

517
00:30:55.361 --> 00:30:58.900
When you can't a look at the amount of high kicks he through before and after

518
00:30:58.901 --> 00:31:01.450
and it's just he wasn't aggressive enough when he came back.

519
00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.530
It wasn't this or that left kick all the time.
It was just like still

520
00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:10.780
care about steroids.
One FC.
Yeah.
They want you on them.
They will for sure.

521
00:31:10.781 --> 00:31:13.240
When I've seen it helps soccer kicks to the face.
Steroids.

522
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:16.570
Steroids are nice about it.
That fucked me up.
When is,

523
00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.790
when is Roger Fighting coming up soon?

524
00:31:18.791 --> 00:31:22.390
I think like September 1st maybe he looks good in training.

525
00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:24.130
Let's look at some of the videos of him.

526
00:31:24.131 --> 00:31:27.310
Any paths I hung out with him and Thailand as a coach.

527
00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:30.720
That was a trip he had fun with man.
Right when I got the time,
when I landed,

528
00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:34.090
the thing that I tripped out on the most,
everybody,
I'm going to tax you.

529
00:31:34.091 --> 00:31:38.560
And we were like getting driven to tie your Muay Thai and everybody's on little

530
00:31:38.561 --> 00:31:42.580
scooters,
like four,
four people per scoot.
Her kids,

531
00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:44.710
they're holding their kids and everyone's riding scooters.

532
00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:48.980
I thought how insane and scary is this?
I ended up at,

533
00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:51.850
Rodger were at this house a couple nights later,

534
00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:56.620
we're a hanging out chillin and there's like four of us.
And they said,

535
00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:00.160
let's go to the party town down the street.
You know,
it's like 45 minutes away.

536
00:32:00.161 --> 00:32:04.900
And I'm like,
okay,
let's go.
And uh,
they all have like,

537
00:32:04.901 --> 00:32:06.880
how are we getting there?
Like,
oh,
we're going on scooters.

538
00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:09.230
So I drove a Roger where's the,

539
00:32:09.231 --> 00:32:13.800
drove me in a scooter and I'm sitting behind him in a scooter or 45 minutes for

540
00:32:13.801 --> 00:32:17.020
the hills and say,
come on Tony.
Since starting right now,

541
00:32:17.021 --> 00:32:21.040
all ball merciay in sims powerful 43 seconds.

542
00:32:21.041 --> 00:32:25.010
Right now I lay Olivier football,
football,

543
00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:28.360
know ca is friends with the guys at Joe Beef and Montreal.

544
00:32:28.361 --> 00:32:30.790
That restaurant that we always eat at.
He's a great guy.

545
00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:35.560
He's got that horse meat in him.
He's got like literally they eat horse meat.

546
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:39.250
I didn't want any dude shut telling you Tony Sims.
Boxing is fucking

547
00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:44.700
filthy.
They Lulu comes in in [inaudible] prime.

548
00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:50.280
I'm doing French media here.
Phones on.
So you hear how retarded you.
So yeah,

549
00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:54.100
but I'm doing for now where I'm helping the French people.
All bomb.

550
00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:56.340
Rca is good on the ground meat you can eat,

551
00:32:56.341 --> 00:32:59.300
they can get you the similar effects to steroids.

552
00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:04.430
No hope you've talked to a rhino meet bear bag.

553
00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:08.190
Those rumors,
Asians will pick up on it and there'll be no licensed.

554
00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:12.230
It's either gotta be something like a shit load of rock bottom testicle that

555
00:33:12.231 --> 00:33:16.340
they can ban you.
Oh you can't eat moose anymore cause it turns out and loose.

556
00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:20.030
Shrinks your balls.
Some stuff that is IGF one in it,

557
00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:23.750
you know that you can get but like really good deer antler.

558
00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:27.530
We'll have IGF one in it.
How about you?
How about you?
There's a guy.

559
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:32.170
How's it are stuffed with steroids?
Does

560
00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:34.913
test positive.

561
00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.410
Did that thing with the antlers.

562
00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:44.650
There's a guy who ran an elk farm up in Alberta and he got an elk farm just for

563
00:33:45.441 --> 00:33:46.940
the deer antler.
Shit.

564
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.600
It would take the velvet velvet and the velvet and the velvet as IGF one.

565
00:33:50.601 --> 00:33:54.560
You spray it in your mouth and it and it gives you a benefit like similar to

566
00:33:54.561 --> 00:33:55.520
taking growth hormone.

567
00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:59.420
The market dried up like instantaneously somehow or another,

568
00:33:59.421 --> 00:34:00.290
I don't know what it was,

569
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:05.120
whether it became too easy to get real growth hormone or people just stop using

570
00:34:05.121 --> 00:34:06.560
it.
I don't know what the fuck happened,

571
00:34:06.561 --> 00:34:09.050
but this guy is stuck with a bunch of elk on this land.

572
00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:11.570
Every now and then he wanders out there and shoots one in,
eats it,

573
00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:16.010
spend 1 million bucks.
It's got to be fenced in elk.
Yeah,

574
00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:19.430
it's come as the fish in this position.
Igf One isn't legal anyways,

575
00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:22.670
and so like what's the point?
You know it's illegal to take that.

576
00:34:22.671 --> 00:34:25.490
If you take that elk deer Antler,
shit,
you can test.

577
00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.840
The trick is is that if you test it and show that it has IGF one,

578
00:34:29.841 --> 00:34:30.740
then it's not illegal.

579
00:34:30.741 --> 00:34:33.710
So you have to do it untested and then you don't know whether it's got it in

580
00:34:33.711 --> 00:34:37.460
there or not.
So it's,
it's like this weird can you mean I'm confused?
Well,

581
00:34:37.461 --> 00:34:41.060
you're not really allowed to sell IGF one like over the counter,
right.

582
00:34:41.061 --> 00:34:45.170
So if you standardize the elk antler to make sure that it has IGF one,

583
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:49.220
then it's not legal as far as I understand when I,
when I looked into it.

584
00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:54.280
So even though it's still just a natural product that contains IGF one,

585
00:34:54.321 --> 00:34:56.630
so it's illegal no matter what cell is a dietary supplement.

586
00:34:56.631 --> 00:35:01.160
I mean you could sell it but not as a dietary supplement.
It would be illegal,

587
00:35:01.161 --> 00:35:03.860
but you wouldn't test for it.
So you could sell the Antler,

588
00:35:03.861 --> 00:35:05.210
but you don't test for it.
And then,

589
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:09.470
but then the consumer doesn't know if it's bullshit,
I just got to sell it.

590
00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:14.350
You're there.
Like the velvet velvet is they grow.

591
00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:18.080
They don't only happens when they grow unless you have a female that grows

592
00:35:18.081 --> 00:35:21.060
antlers,
which is very rare and sometimes they stay in velvet.
How though?

593
00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.780
How did they figure?
There's IGF one in the antlers.

594
00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:29.960
What kind of crazy fun figured that out?
I don't know.

595
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:34.980
Some fucking country acts swinging redneck was just eating antler and just shred

596
00:35:34.981 --> 00:35:38.140
it.
Just Dick.
Just nice

597
00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:42.550
<v 0>to me feel better.
I do have his insulin growth factor one.
Is that what that is,</v>

598
00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:46.890
isn't it?
What HTA.
Is that what hh converts to in the body?
Is that correct or no?

599
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.730
I do a little research or go deeper on that and I'm not sure,

600
00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:53.880
but either way I need it.
A lot of guys were taking that though.

601
00:35:53.881 --> 00:35:57.280
A lot of football players are taking a football book.
Deer antler.
Yeah.

602
00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:00.750
He's real popular stuff.
I know a tennis pro does it and I was like,
well,

603
00:36:00.751 --> 00:36:04.590
I don't know.
What'd he say?
He swears by it.
He plays,
he can play all day.

604
00:36:04.591 --> 00:36:09.060
I mean he's,
did they test in 10 he swears by Goji berries and deer antler.

605
00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:13.230
Goji Berries,
very high in antioxidants.
Do they test the tennis

606
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:18.110
tour?
Sure.
Yeah,
definitely.
That's why,
uh,
the,
uh,

607
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:22.200
tried to test it was Venus or Serena for sure.
She ran into her fucking safe.

608
00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:25.530
She had a safe house,
safe room in her house in case her house got home,

609
00:36:25.531 --> 00:36:27.180
invaded Sharan tour,
uh,

610
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:31.180
her safe room and called the cops on the fucking drug testers.
Really?

611
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:34.680
Cause she didn't want to get tested.
Dude.

612
00:36:34.681 --> 00:36:39.330
After talking to know Wicki and talking to the two guys that I've talked to,
um,

613
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:42.960
uh,
what's his face from balco,
Victor Conte and Debicki.

614
00:36:42.961 --> 00:36:47.730
I am convinced that there's just a giant percentage of professional athletes

615
00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:51.910
that are on steroids and certainly you needed to talk to them to figure that
out.

616
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:55.830
You really need to like find out what the methods are.
You know,

617
00:36:55.831 --> 00:36:59.760
they have testosterone now that they're making with animals no longer with yams.

618
00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:04.890
So now the carbon isotope tasks that they used to catch people that were taking

619
00:37:04.891 --> 00:37:09.670
plant based testosterone,
it doesn't work anymore.
So now you get,
you know,

620
00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:12.360
this guy's going to be on this animal base testosterone.

621
00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:14.130
So explain to me how they get,
I mean,

622
00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:17.760
I can't believe they get testosterone from yams.
This is strange.
No idea.

623
00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:22.390
You should probably pull out your phone and Google it and explainers dosing now,

624
00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:26.760
right?
Yeah.
Boy was talking about doing four hour doses.
The dose,

625
00:37:26.761 --> 00:37:29.790
it only stays in your system for four hours.
Yeah.

626
00:37:29.791 --> 00:37:33.090
That's like the Alex Rodriguez Shit.
He was taking gummy bears,
testosterone,

627
00:37:33.091 --> 00:37:33.924
gummy bears.

628
00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:37.380
It's not going to be long till they can clone your pituitary and it would just

629
00:37:37.381 --> 00:37:39.960
have it pumping out your own hormones.
Yeah,
right.

630
00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:42.390
God wants some more from my spare pituitary over there.

631
00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:46.050
Hopefully we'll get a second.
Pituitary gland stalled her hair for sure.

632
00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:47.730
Watch your head get wider.
Shut up.

633
00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:52.390
Just put one in the Tate just right in the face and the tank.
Yeah,

634
00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:55.140
you get your spleen removed.
Replaced it with a pituitary gland.

635
00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.690
Did he say anything about the longterm effects?

636
00:37:57.691 --> 00:37:59.880
It doesn't seem like there's any evidence that like,

637
00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:04.650
like microdosing testosterone is bad for you while your body has testosterone in

638
00:38:04.651 --> 00:38:07.020
it.
It's not a foreign substance.
Your body knows what to do with it.

639
00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:11.010
The problem with things that your body doesn't know what to do with his
toxicity.

640
00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.060
Liver toxicity,
you know,
there's,

641
00:38:13.061 --> 00:38:16.830
there's a lot of issues with all sorts of different substances like EPO that

642
00:38:16.831 --> 00:38:20.200
caused strokes,
unnatural things like when you take an EPO,

643
00:38:20.201 --> 00:38:23.430
your body's producing way more fucking red blood cells and it's supposed to,

644
00:38:23.431 --> 00:38:26.340
what your bloods like sludge,
all sorts of issues with that.

645
00:38:26.341 --> 00:38:29.970
But testosterone he bought,
he knows what to do with it.
It's in there naturally.

646
00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:33.410
He,
although they're talking about those,
uh,
uh,
the Baikal,

647
00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:36.040
the bike riders wake up in the middle of the night cause their

648
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.260
<v 1>blood so thick.
They told you this?
Yeah.</v>

649
00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:40.990
They would wake up and ride their bike in the middle of the night.
Yeah.

650
00:38:40.991 --> 00:38:44.380
That's a buddy of ours go crazy because they had to get rid of the blood cells

651
00:38:44.381 --> 00:38:47.500
or what do you mean?
Yeah,
what do you want?
So thick it blood so thick.

652
00:38:47.501 --> 00:38:49.300
You have to wear yourself out and you have to,

653
00:38:49.301 --> 00:38:52.420
you have to do workouts and drink a lot of water in the middle of the night.

654
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:55.540
They would set their alarms.
They get up every few hours and work out.

655
00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:58.900
I heard a heart surgeon talk about one thing you can do.

656
00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:03.310
There are some studies that suggest that giving blood once a year actually is

657
00:39:03.311 --> 00:39:07.990
the best thing you can do to avoid stroke.
Um,
and women have,

658
00:39:07.991 --> 00:39:10.870
they think have less stroke and less heart disease.

659
00:39:10.871 --> 00:39:15.160
It might be because they bleed once a month.
So what happens is you,

660
00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:18.680
I guess your blood actually literally gets thinner.
Um,

661
00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:24.050
now some rationale for leaches back in the day nobody was talking about was

662
00:39:24.841 --> 00:39:27.550
really fascinating because you know what you can do to increase your,

663
00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:31.280
I guess lower your cholesterol and especially in give blood.
I,

664
00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.090
God damn it back some studies MTM,

665
00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:37.430
it Tony about mercy is,

666
00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:42.400
yeah,
he's looks very strong,
very strong.

667
00:39:42.401 --> 00:39:44.470
Haufle Easter bowling in the corner there.

668
00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:51.500
Yeah.
Elliot Christian L.
Yeah,
they're just having a heart disease.

669
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:55.180
You having a hard time keeping this guy off of them all over that he wants

670
00:39:55.181 --> 00:39:58.630
nothing in the standup game with them.
He just pin them is and taking them down.

671
00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:02.080
Well smart because smart.
That's smart though.

672
00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:06.800
<v 2>There's my boyfriend Krishna.</v>

673
00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:12.470
<v 1>It's going to be weird when they come up with all these fucking genetic</v>

674
00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.420
manipulations that they're working on right now.

675
00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:18.170
They think China's already got myostatin inhibitors in place for their athletes.

676
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:22.940
CISA,
smancy.
Yeah,
and the thing,
they're already experimenting on it.

677
00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:25.400
They got someone locked up in a mountain somewhere and they got some fucking

678
00:40:25.401 --> 00:40:30.230
dude who's a triple muscle and was going to live to be 190 that's awesome.

679
00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:32.200
Awesome.
By the way,
that's what,

680
00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:35.130
that's what happened to those mice when they ran those tests on those miles tat

681
00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:38.690
and inhibitors in mice,
the mice became superhuman or super mice.

682
00:40:38.691 --> 00:40:41.720
They've got all this muscle on them and they live longer and they don't

683
00:40:41.721 --> 00:40:46.430
degenerate.
Wow.
There was this like double must sign me up right now.

684
00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:50.810
That'd be,
I'd get rid of it at the time where we take sims,
turn around,

685
00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:55.330
look at this.
He's about to get taken down again,
but how about tell my why.

686
00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:59.210
How about wider,
little wider there fell a little wider with that stands please.

687
00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:03.270
There'll be a time when we choose bodies like cars.

688
00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:07.080
That's going to be a sarcoma insert consciousness into whatever body.

689
00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:10.770
Every girl is going to look the same.
There's going to be designer cars.

690
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:12.990
That was all we switch it up though.
You know,

691
00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:16.740
they'll come out with a new model and that'll be,
how else can you do?

692
00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:19.350
How long realistically,
how long?

693
00:41:19.351 --> 00:41:23.610
500 years where they could pull your consciousness now a consciousness out and

694
00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:27.000
put it into Kate's body.
How long?
500 years.
Well,

695
00:41:27.001 --> 00:41:29.010
we're going to be able to have chips less than that.

696
00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:31.530
We're going to be able to have chips and you're going to be able to live your

697
00:41:31.531 --> 00:41:34.340
life and then give me a chip at the of the day and like,
what'd you do today?

698
00:41:34.341 --> 00:41:35.990
You like,
watch it,
do it.

699
00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:40.550
Plugging into May and I'll live the life of Eddie Bravo for a day.
I'm like,
Bro,

700
00:41:40.551 --> 00:41:44.000
check out this chick I hooked up with play this.
I should have.
Watch it.

701
00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:48.010
Sell your dreams.
You know what I mean?
Record your dreams.
Sound Bull.
Yeah.

702
00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:50.850
There's going to be a lot of weird shit going on in the next hundred,
200 years.

703
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:52.303
There's one thing though,

704
00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:54.770
that novelty of like being able to choose your body or whatever it is.

705
00:41:54.771 --> 00:41:57.380
It's like one of the things I think that people appreciate it.

706
00:41:57.381 --> 00:41:59.960
It's like it's his hard work,

707
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.110
his people married and what it is and like if there's no merit to it,

708
00:42:03.111 --> 00:42:03.950
what's the value of it?

709
00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:08.600
Our way forging character and it's a spiritual crisis.

710
00:42:08.601 --> 00:42:10.970
I mean it's a thing because like outside of the physical realm,

711
00:42:10.971 --> 00:42:11.721
there's a whole nother,

712
00:42:11.721 --> 00:42:14.930
there's a whole entire other conversation to have with that and like at what

713
00:42:14.931 --> 00:42:17.910
time do we get tired of the novelty for something with substance,
right.
Our,

714
00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:21.470
our entire paradigm is built on that,
on struggle and the parents

715
00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:27.860
come from who you are though.
That's not your body.
Right?

716
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:31.100
If you could be a 12 year old boy right now,
would you be,

717
00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:35.420
what of you identify as a 12 year old boy?
Can you still get into Chucky cheese?

718
00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:40.580
You can identify as anybody now that you can identify as black.

719
00:42:40.581 --> 00:42:42.290
They caught a second guy pretending to be black.

720
00:42:42.291 --> 00:42:47.291
Did you see that guy who identified as being an amputee and thought that's what

721
00:42:47.571 --> 00:42:50.270
he was and then he cut off his arms cause it's his hand.

722
00:42:50.271 --> 00:42:54.090
Didn't feel normal to them.
I did see that.
Yeah,
no,
I saw it.

723
00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:56.980
It's called mental illness.
It's called so,

724
00:42:56.981 --> 00:43:00.290
so flies in the face of all this stuff about like,
oh,
we're all born equal.

725
00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:03.620
No we're not.
There's some different shit.
It's stupid.

726
00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:06.860
It's stupid to say that we're born equal.
It's,
it's nonsense.
No,

727
00:43:06.861 --> 00:43:09.050
we don't all start at the same starting line gestures,

728
00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:13.160
the social construct man to social construct.

729
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:16.430
It's not,
no,
no.
We're all different as fuck.

730
00:43:16.431 --> 00:43:21.020
There's a broad spectrum of human beings and some of us have hands and some of

731
00:43:21.021 --> 00:43:24.350
us,
a lot of it's meant don't want hand.
Well,
a lot of it,
like the guy,

732
00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:27.230
the amputee,
you're talking about,
a lot of it's,
you know,
mental disease,
right?

733
00:43:27.231 --> 00:43:28.210
So what do you do with those guys?

734
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:30.680
Like here's the thing I was talking with Brian.
How about child molesters?

735
00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:34.700
You're mentally fucked up,
man.
The subway guy,

736
00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:38.660
you're going to get a foot long son.
You need a foot long now in jail.

737
00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:43.280
Police don't say that again Jerry.
There was a cover of Mark Daily News.

738
00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:46.410
Was it really?
Yes.
Yeah,
it was what?

739
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:49.550
The cover of New York Daily News expect a foot long in jail.

740
00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:54.920
Um,
but I think he's super screwed.
He super screwed.

741
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:58.850
But there was an article recently that was talking about people that have a

742
00:43:58.851 --> 00:43:59.684
natural

743
00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:06.040
inclination towards pedophilia and that it's something that is hardwired into

744
00:44:06.471 --> 00:44:07.250
their brain.

745
00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:10.700
And then they were trying to make this argument along those same lines as

746
00:44:10.701 --> 00:44:13.010
someone bring transgender.
And I was like,
Whoa,

747
00:44:13.011 --> 00:44:18.011
this is a fucking very tricky argument because if you start giving people the

748
00:44:18.111 --> 00:44:20.960
green light to be pedophiles in any way,
shape or form,

749
00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:24.940
there's a lot of people gonna jump on that.
It's not,
what's not the debate.

750
00:44:24.941 --> 00:44:27.350
I'm not saying it's a debate,
I'm talking about the science behind it.

751
00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:31.890
Using it raises questions that they're transgender.
Either

752
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.660
<v 0>it's a social issue,
right?</v>

753
00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.750
There's no science where people saying people are absolutely born a woman

754
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.270
trapped in a man's body.
But socially we were all accepting.

755
00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:41.220
The bigger question becomes this.
If you can,

756
00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:43.080
if you can prove that it's neurological,

757
00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:46.350
then what classifies as his disability.

758
00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:48.990
And now we all agree we don't want those people in your children.

759
00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:53.160
But the question becomes two,
two falls,
all of us before punishment,

760
00:44:53.161 --> 00:44:55.800
the most important thing is that they don't molest children.

761
00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:58.680
That's what we want to stop them from doing.
So the question becomes,

762
00:44:58.710 --> 00:45:01.620
do you give them safe haven to talk about it?
Go get help,

763
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:05.100
figure out how to cure it,
you know,
whatever.
I trust them,
trust them deeply.

764
00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:07.740
You have to trust them deeply to not do anything about it.

765
00:45:07.741 --> 00:45:08.970
Not to act on their urges.

766
00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:13.290
Trusting a guy who lives in an island of hot chicks and not fuck Nah,

767
00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:17.410
you keep them very far away from CIC children at this point.
That may change.

768
00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:19.560
I mean,
yeah,
but you're,

769
00:45:19.561 --> 00:45:21.930
so you're going to take them to jail to have a certain gene or are you going to

770
00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:24.150
wait until they act?
That's the question.
So,
so,

771
00:45:24.151 --> 00:45:26.930
so most important is if they do find it neurological,

772
00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:30.900
maybe there's a way to cure that or,
or,
or block the gene eventually.

773
00:45:30.901 --> 00:45:33.440
But for that,
I don't think it's a genetic thing.
Well,

774
00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:37.140
what they find is it might very well be most pedophiles of in a strange way are

775
00:45:37.141 --> 00:45:39.630
lefthanded.
Why we don't know,
but,

776
00:45:39.631 --> 00:45:43.110
but for the most part there is a lot of evidence that suggests it could be

777
00:45:43.111 --> 00:45:45.750
neurologic.
It's not who you are.

778
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:48.430
Maybe in some cases,
you know there's,

779
00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:52.470
there's a lot of different ways as we learn more about brain science,

780
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:56.220
it's did you just finding more and more that sometimes this is a form of quote

781
00:45:56.221 --> 00:45:59.310
unquote brain damage or mental illness or whatever.
It doesn't.

782
00:45:59.311 --> 00:46:02.960
The brain doesn't come out perfect every time.
No sims is on top here.
Atlanta,

783
00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:07.440
it's a fucking hammers man.
These are,
these are legit shot.
He hits hard man.

784
00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:11.070
He hits fucking hard in close quarters.
That's one thing about strikers.

785
00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:14.070
You see that there's a big difference in what they can generate,

786
00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:18.240
the amount of power they can at short distances with a,
with ground and pound.

787
00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:20.610
You see that with cro cop in that Gonzaga file,

788
00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:25.260
those elbows inside the guard bits.
Because Cro cop is a legit striker.

789
00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:29.270
And you're seeing this here with sims.
He's close quarters.
Fucking merciay up.

790
00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:32.880
You said Tony Ferguson or little John Dodson?

791
00:46:32.881 --> 00:46:36.060
Man there generate power in like inches and make it count.
Oh,

792
00:46:36.061 --> 00:46:39.420
speaking of which Ferguson's gonna Fight Khabib.
That's a fight.

793
00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:44.730
That is a motherfucker muck on off in Ferguson is a fuck.
When is that?

794
00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:48.760
I don't know.
Do not know,
but I love it.
I love it.

795
00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.160
But that's a great,

796
00:46:50.161 --> 00:46:53.640
especially when you see what Ferguson has been fucking doing it people lately.

797
00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:53.871
Well it's,

798
00:46:53.871 --> 00:46:58.270
to me it's just see negative word off because he's been hurt for Madoff.

799
00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:01.680
They can.
You say,
what did you call me

800
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:05.910
be heartbeat and never coming off.
It's gonna be,

801
00:47:05.911 --> 00:47:09.650
it's just to see him cause he had so much time off and his knees jacked.

802
00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:10.860
It's a tough fight.
I don't,

803
00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:13.890
I don't think he's needs 100% I don't think it can be.
That's a tough

804
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:21.690
boy.
Oh boy.
Oh boy.
Eddie as he got it.
Eddie.
Nope.

805
00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:24.120
He's trying it seem to be struggling

806
00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:28.930
sideways here.
Triangle.
Come on.
It's right.

807
00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:33.790
<v 1>You don't want a guy goes against a guy who's just better than him.
At Jujitsu,</v>

808
00:47:33.791 --> 00:47:37.210
there's a certain amount of like recognition that the guys better and you don't

809
00:47:37.211 --> 00:47:40.360
try for certain shit.
You get big brother to a little bit.
Yeah.

810
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:46.240
Almost too much respect.
But then like you go for a a Saab and you're like,

811
00:47:46.241 --> 00:47:48.900
fuck,
I'm not really going to get this.
You don't believe in it.
Now,

812
00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:54.970
ultimate fighter,
September 9th Aldo and my boy,

813
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:57.940
Uriah Faber,
Gregor Mcgregor,
McGregor rather.

814
00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:01.900
I don't know about the ultimate fighter format.
I Dunno about that format.

815
00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:04.510
Will they're banking on Eikon or bringing the views now,
right?

816
00:48:04.511 --> 00:48:07.350
It's like they're doing whatever they can to get the views back.
Yeah.

817
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:10.780
I don't know man.
You just got to switch it up.
If I was Connor,

818
00:48:10.781 --> 00:48:13.480
I wouldn't be into doing it.
Me Neither.
But does that mean to you?

819
00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:17.740
Hurts his brand?
That means he's going to fight.
No,
no.
Possibly happen.

820
00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:20.170
It could turn it.
Listen,
let me tell you something right now.

821
00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:23.140
If all though gets hurt again,
they easily could have that fight.

822
00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:28.300
They easily could have Uriah faber versus Connor just supervising easily,
easily.

823
00:48:28.301 --> 00:48:30.630
It's a great backup for sure.
Don't get through,

824
00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:33.820
especially if during the show if they can some on other generate some

825
00:48:33.821 --> 00:48:37.540
respectable ratings.
How has all the doing do they may know.
Who knows?

826
00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:41.260
Hopefully good things going to get hurt again.
It could easily get hurt again.

827
00:48:41.261 --> 00:48:44.950
Just pulled out for multiple fights and there's,
you know,

828
00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:48.610
depending on what is actually going on when it comes to pds over there,

829
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:50.500
who knows?
Who knows?

830
00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:54.130
I mean there's so much speculation is coach had a presscamp weeks.

831
00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:58.000
I know about pds and we will Brennan,
we would be,
no,
but he's a British ship.

832
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.420
Washed his mouth out.
Yeah.
Hey guys.
Brandon likes Brazilians.
Take it easy.

833
00:49:01.421 --> 00:49:05.200
We're not insulting.
That's not obvious.
You're doing shit at all.
Well,
there's,

834
00:49:05.201 --> 00:49:08.570
there's without a doubt a certain amount of people that have been on the ped

835
00:49:08.610 --> 00:49:12.340
side.
I think it's a legit for focus of discussion.
I just do.

836
00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:13.690
I'm not going to not talk about it.

837
00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:17.140
I'm not going to not talk about it as a speculation.
It's legit.

838
00:49:17.141 --> 00:49:21.550
And especially after talking to Novitsky and talking to many,
many,
many,
many,

839
00:49:21.551 --> 00:49:25.340
many fighters and managers,
the trainers,
they work.
Of course they work.
Yeah.

840
00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:28.720
And here's the other thing,
well 10 Kennedy said to you,
he's like,
if you,

841
00:49:28.721 --> 00:49:30.820
you've been tested.
I haven't been tested.

842
00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:34.810
You know that like everyone is being tested.
Everyone's being tested.
Really.

843
00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:39.160
He's like,
who's been tested?
Yeah.
Tim got,
I think he got tested yesterday.

844
00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:40.900
The day before.
Was that some of the UFC,

845
00:49:40.901 --> 00:49:45.040
it wasn't that UFC really who tested him because Tim had pissed bottles up and

846
00:49:45.041 --> 00:49:49.390
it was like get,
but that was no cause he,
he put that out and goes,

847
00:49:49.391 --> 00:49:52.510
UFC still hasn't test me.
He goes,
I'm in touch.
And now I think at the military,

848
00:49:52.511 --> 00:49:55.540
test them all the time and he goes to the UFC,
still hasn't tested me.

849
00:49:55.690 --> 00:49:56.800
Jesus Christ.

850
00:49:57.100 --> 00:50:00.640
And the question is too is like not even who's currently on steroids,

851
00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:04.780
but who's on,
who's on the live roster that's moving.
That has been,
that's like,

852
00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:07.870
I mean there's guys that are cycling in and out all that all the time and really

853
00:50:07.871 --> 00:50:10.840
I think the question Eddie asked,
but like who's not,

854
00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:13.540
how many guys aren't is like who's never done that?

855
00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:17.230
That's that signed under that contract that gets that check from the EOC.
Yeah.

856
00:50:17.231 --> 00:50:20.140
That was a weird moment.
And the Anderson Silva press conference where they said,

857
00:50:20.141 --> 00:50:24.070
is this the first time you've ever been tested at a competition?
And he goes,
yes.

858
00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:28.190
And I'm like,
fuck.
The one time they pop you,
the only time

859
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:31.190
<v 0>you've ever been tested at a competition and they pop you,</v>

860
00:50:31.310 --> 00:50:32.810
but did any take by Agra or something?

861
00:50:33.210 --> 00:50:36.290
Legitly that's what he says is more than one story.

862
00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:41.000
Bas Rutten was going over it and he said he changed his story three times.

863
00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:46.490
Are you test positive?
Is that what happens here?
Let's not talk over each other.

864
00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:50.120
Elevate testosterone.
We did.
Jagger does,
no,
it has nothing to do with it.

865
00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:51.560
What did you say?
Hold on.

866
00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:55.110
But viagara ad is a performance enhancing drug and it is illegal because vi

867
00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:58.010
Viagara actually does enhance your body.

868
00:50:58.011 --> 00:51:02.330
It's like a very extreme version of nitric oxide is a dilator and blood flow.

869
00:51:02.331 --> 00:51:05.660
Right.
So really does benefit you in an endurance.
Wow.
Yeah.

870
00:51:05.661 --> 00:51:08.180
Endurance Athletes Take Viagra.
Blood vessels.
I've,

871
00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:11.780
I've trained on it before I did a Jujitsu,
I took a Cialis.
And did you just,

872
00:51:11.781 --> 00:51:15.320
you just see what it was like?
Yeah,
I'd get it benefits you,

873
00:51:15.321 --> 00:51:17.690
but no more so than shrimp tech.
Mushroom.

874
00:51:18.090 --> 00:51:20.380
[inaudible]

875
00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:27.770
the 10th planet secret.

876
00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:32.800
You don't get hard unless you're [inaudible].

877
00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:39.860
You just say,
is that shut up?
Nope.
That's my Dick.

878
00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:42.980
Still.
Cops are brutal man.

879
00:51:43.070 --> 00:51:45.410
And what could you do if you've got the guys back with their hooks in?

880
00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:49.040
Just find the guy,
be immersive.
Stare at it until he's done.

881
00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:53.840
Press down on this paint.
Just tap right.
Yep.
Now Tab.
But don't be silly.

882
00:51:53.841 --> 00:51:57.560
Don't be in polite.
Just realize that there's a pecking order and he's the alpha.

883
00:51:57.950 --> 00:52:01.790
It's amazing to me that those metal cups are not illegal in the UFC.

884
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:08.470
To train with guys with a cups on is a drag and that's a for sure because they

885
00:52:08.721 --> 00:52:09.890
put it in you cause it hurts.
You mean

886
00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:18.410
fulcrum point for armbars break people's arms with it guys on top of half guard

887
00:52:18.411 --> 00:52:21.560
and grinding like that.
That's a thing,
man,
that's a not calm,

888
00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:25.230
you know north south the session.
Oh you remember Amir [inaudible] Amir,
right?

889
00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:28.860
I've already mounted me once and he put the grape vines entity had a go,

890
00:52:28.890 --> 00:52:32.570
what the fuck is that?
He goes,
this is a Thai Cup pro steel tie cup.
I go,

891
00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:36.770
what the fuck man?
He was like,
no,
it was mounding me.

892
00:52:36.771 --> 00:52:39.290
He was pressing it down on my back in the day.

893
00:52:39.291 --> 00:52:42.590
Those were the only guys you when you were training and there's a new guy,

894
00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:45.510
they're always kickboxers are boxers that came in that wanted to try to ditch
it.

895
00:52:45.511 --> 00:52:48.220
Those were the only guys that work up.
There was never really grappling dude.

896
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:52.850
Like I never really knew Jujitsu guys that would wear cops,
something like now,

897
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:55.520
but back then it was like guys that came in from kickbox.

898
00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:57.340
The way I train is I put shorts on,

899
00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:00.380
I get my shoes on and I put my cup on and that's the same way they would come

900
00:53:00.381 --> 00:53:04.310
onto the match.
Well,
I'm amazed at how many guys fight and they have like cups.

901
00:53:04.311 --> 00:53:07.910
They're a little loose in their jockstrap.
They have regular old cups.

902
00:53:07.911 --> 00:53:12.610
Like you guys are out of your fucking shitty ones.
Pop right now.

903
00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:15.350
Those diamond Emma made cups are so God damn good.

904
00:53:15.351 --> 00:53:19.270
You'd have to be fucking crazy to wear anything else other than a tie cuff of

905
00:53:19.271 --> 00:53:22.370
than a tie cup with the rope.
You just did it.
You'd have some crazy,

906
00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:25.820
I never wore one and football.
It's

907
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:30.300
<v 1>whatever,
man.
You let that fucking three piece set that baby bird just flop.</v>

908
00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:31.653
<v 3>Good job</v>

909
00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:36.073
<v 1>free</v>

910
00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:37.203
<v 3>you.</v>

911
00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:42.460
<v 0>I always wear one Eddie.
I never wear a cop.
No,
no,
there's a whole star.
Oh,</v>

912
00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:44.350
oh guys.
Sorry.

913
00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:49.390
I would only wear one like a week or two weeks before a fight to get used to it

914
00:53:49.391 --> 00:53:51.130
cause I was going to wear it at the fight,
but I would never,

915
00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:52.930
never ever wear it training or anything.

916
00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:55.980
I never wore a training once until I was rolling with Einstein.

917
00:53:55.990 --> 00:54:00.990
He's trying to pass my guard and he shoved his knee right into my debt and I got

918
00:54:01.961 --> 00:54:03.990
out of the class and I took my,

919
00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:08.620
my jock strap off and it was filled with blood and the blood was coming out of

920
00:54:08.621 --> 00:54:11.490
my Dick.
It was in the smashed by deck.
Yup.

921
00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:15.730
I get smashed and I was trying to figure out if I should go to the hospital and

922
00:54:15.731 --> 00:54:18.970
I figured,
well if it was my nose when I go to the hospital,
no.
So I said,

923
00:54:18.971 --> 00:54:20.460
all right,
let me just go home and say it and that.

924
00:54:20.461 --> 00:54:24.010
So I was feeling it didn't hurt.
So I said,
let me see if I could get it hard.

925
00:54:24.250 --> 00:54:27.820
So I got hard and I jogged off.
I checked all good.

926
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:31.120
I jerked off and it came out like a,
like one of those chickens.

927
00:54:31.121 --> 00:54:34.110
You ever get a chicken?
It's got an MRI on it.
That's all bloody and all.

928
00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:37.120
You got any photos?
No.
So I pissed.

929
00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:41.380
I pissed and came blood for three or four days,
but it never hurt.

930
00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:45.220
I would have gone right to the doc to me to feel like under that scrutiny of,

931
00:54:45.490 --> 00:54:49.780
hmm,
if it were my nose,
what my cock is so much more important than my nose.

932
00:54:49.781 --> 00:54:53.050
I can say that it was good luck on your cock.

933
00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:56.800
High grade missing.
No is going to suck your Dick

934
00:54:59.710 --> 00:55:03.610
fucking skeletor do with his giant Dick.
Did He,

935
00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:07.410
did he smash your balls or the trunk right into my Dick Hole.

936
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:10.030
Like it was like he was trying to happen,
you know,

937
00:55:10.031 --> 00:55:14.810
it's that pass like when someone's trying to slice the knee through.
Yup.
And uh,

938
00:55:14.830 --> 00:55:19.420
as you see,
he just made a mistake.
It's thanks.
I'm slammed in my day.

939
00:55:19.421 --> 00:55:22.930
It was only one time.
It happened after.
Who knows how many years of training.

940
00:55:22.931 --> 00:55:27.010
But that was it for me dog that got you weren't on Cialis if hard.

941
00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:27.853
That's what I'm saying.

942
00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:30.660
Well it probably would have absorbed it better or rip that all.

943
00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:34.060
Like do you ever have a girl riding you and then slips out and then lands on it?

944
00:55:34.070 --> 00:55:39.000
She's cause mine is too.
I know.
Got Us broken.
How about the homeboys?

945
00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:43.270
Remember homeboy,
he got his Dick Broken.
I talked to him.
He was in a wheelchair.

946
00:55:43.271 --> 00:55:48.271
I talked to that guy in a wheelchair after it happened and he told me exactly

947
00:55:48.671 --> 00:55:53.150
what happened and how it broken half girl riding Romer.
Yeah.

948
00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:57.220
Oh that's,
oh that's an a reckless girl.
He was in a wheelchair.

949
00:55:57.990 --> 00:56:01.600
The real freaks out hold on earth a lot.
Everywhere I go,
two days broke.

950
00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:04.300
The guy's an Emily fighter.
My,
I know a guy

951
00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:08.100
<v 1>kicked in the nuts from fighting and in his team he,
he's testosterone.</v>

952
00:56:08.101 --> 00:56:12.060
What got rid of though out later on in his life and the doctor said it's

953
00:56:12.061 --> 00:56:14.720
probably because cause he had his one ball is bigger than the other because it

954
00:56:14.721 --> 00:56:19.380
never swelled and everyone down doc said you injured your nuts fighting and

955
00:56:19.381 --> 00:56:21.740
that's why,
that's probably why you're here.

956
00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:26.190
There was one of the guys who was fighting the UFC was a training and he went to

957
00:56:26.250 --> 00:56:29.260
spar with a buddy and he just didn't bother putting his cup on cause they were

958
00:56:29.261 --> 00:56:31.990
just going to move around.
Light got kicked in the balls,
losses ball.

959
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:36.220
She said never.
Never.
Never seen him again.
Never.
No.
He went,

960
00:56:36.221 --> 00:56:37.660
his ball exploded.

961
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:43.080
He got kicked in the ball and it's just the surgery.
Surgery.
You just leave it.

962
00:56:43.090 --> 00:56:45.790
Are you going to do,
he started trying to read the door.
He used to do,

963
00:56:45.810 --> 00:56:50.770
he'd take a cheese cloth,
your wrap it up,
tighten it down.
Now it's nothing.

964
00:56:50.771 --> 00:56:54.220
It's like they removed it exploded.
I finally figured out,

965
00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:58.570
you see those like spectacles where they have some guy gets kicked in the nuts

966
00:56:58.571 --> 00:57:01.720
like really hard.
Like a Kung Fu guy would just stand that.
Well,

967
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:04.420
I figured out what he's doing because occasionally when I'm having sex,

968
00:57:04.421 --> 00:57:06.220
like one ball of find a hiding place

969
00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:15.520
go and then you just plop it out.
Yeah,
but they just must do that.

970
00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:18.250
Go backstage and they just hide that fact.

971
00:57:18.290 --> 00:57:22.490
Their ball flight science did a study on it and they said that actually fights

972
00:57:22.491 --> 00:57:26.800
science,
not science.
What they do in movies.
A lot of times,

973
00:57:26.801 --> 00:57:31.330
actually one at a time here.
What are their balls developed calcium deposits.

974
00:57:31.370 --> 00:57:34.750
Brian,
their balls actually gets super hard from,
from trauma.

975
00:57:35.410 --> 00:57:37.240
I feel like red bands,
not even here.
And I feel like,

976
00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:41.380
oh Brian and I mean a little bit.
I'm telling you,

977
00:57:41.890 --> 00:57:46.890
I realized real of the whole shot ski versus near.

978
00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:51.940
They use our ski from a decade ago.
Look at this.
That,
I'll tell you what,

979
00:57:51.941 --> 00:57:53.860
that Frank Mir,
Todd Duffy fight was

980
00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:59.560
crazy.
How about big foot?

981
00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:02.480
Couldn't take a punch at all then fight.

982
00:58:02.481 --> 00:58:05.320
So a Aly and he's back can take a punch.
No problem.

983
00:58:05.490 --> 00:58:08.170
I don't like that rematch with big foot Mark Hunt.

984
00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:12.190
That's a legendary fight and now you've got to,
I don't like it man.

985
00:58:12.191 --> 00:58:15.730
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't take away from that fight.
I'm sorry.

986
00:58:15.731 --> 00:58:19.640
But why thought Andre Arlovski was fighting for the title?
Why no cane is,

987
00:58:20.410 --> 00:58:25.200
I dunno.
I thought that was the rumor.
No cane.
I think,
you know,

988
00:58:25.201 --> 00:58:29.980
it was,
it was going to either be dos Joe's or uh,
uh,
Dosantos for other,

989
00:58:31.810 --> 00:58:35.770
I don't know whether they'll do Dosantos ovary over him is begging for it.
Yeah,

990
00:58:35.771 --> 00:58:39.790
they are doing that.
That's the fight.
But our Laskey cut.
Damn.
Look at this.

991
00:58:40.090 --> 00:58:44.350
When he stopped Travis Browne.
God Damn,
he's back.
He's vicious.

992
00:58:44.351 --> 00:58:45.370
Fucking striker.

993
00:58:45.630 --> 00:58:48.430
You know the guy had some confidence problems and got killed a bunch of times,

994
00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:51.820
but the end of the day,
that guy,
he's a vicious fucking Stryker.

995
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:53.470
How about for him?
Sticking through it?

996
00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:56.940
What do you get knocked out four in a row many times.
Get them now.
Well,

997
00:58:56.941 --> 00:59:00.610
watch his fight with carrots off in Strikeforce.
A tough fight to watch,
man.

998
00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:04.420
You Watch that fight?
These fights over.
This is over.
Oh,
Todd Duffy.

999
00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:09.640
God Damn Son.
Those are both similar fights.

1000
00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:14.850
Mere Duffy and very similar Travis Browne.
Yeah,
and a lot of ways,
right?

1001
00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:19.060
Just wild.
Except the end.
The 10 years was so definitive.

1002
00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:23.480
I mean mirrors.
There was no back from that.
I mean he could,

1003
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:25.760
they could account it to a hundred up mayor too.
Man.

1004
00:59:25.850 --> 00:59:29.900
Here's another guy just stuck with it,
man.
Look at him.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1005
00:59:29.901 --> 00:59:33.410
He's just got to think about just a few years ago,
he was like,
what?

1006
00:59:33.411 --> 00:59:35.360
What does he want it out of his last six?

1007
00:59:35.361 --> 00:59:38.540
How about when Josh Barnett crushed him?
Just like two years ago?

1008
00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:42.650
Josh Barnett crushed him two years ago.
Now he's on the verge of a title shot.

1009
00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:44.100
Chad la priests,

1010
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:49.270
Cisco Train Aldo Turn Aldo fought one 85 at ultimate fighter in Brazil and now

1011
00:59:49.881 --> 00:59:53.240
he's won 55
crazy

1012
00:59:56.050 --> 00:59:58.950
dude.
Chad,
the priests coming out with a cross on the,

1013
00:59:58.970 --> 01:00:02.360
the ivy thing doesn't start talk Tober correct.
Exactly.

1014
01:00:02.361 --> 01:00:05.630
That's why this December five with all those going to be real problematic for Mr

1015
01:00:05.631 --> 01:00:09.410
Mcgregor.
Cause Mr McGregor cuts a fuck load of weight.

1016
01:00:09.411 --> 01:00:11.600
So it does all of the Yup.
Both guys do.

1017
01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:13.640
They both look like they just got to start cutting early.

1018
01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:16.240
So does Weichman though.
Why did cuts a shitload?

1019
01:00:16.330 --> 01:00:19.120
Oh well you know this is the conversation that I had with um,

1020
01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:21.800
if it scales like they have to add weight classes.

1021
01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:24.890
They have to but the UFC doesn't want to add weight classes cause they think it

1022
01:00:24.891 --> 01:00:27.620
waters down the sport.
Yeah.
I don't have too much.
She had a fan of that.

1023
01:00:27.650 --> 01:00:29.860
I think there's enough weight classes leave it the way they are,

1024
01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:33.650
does not deal with it.
But there's not this giant jumps.
There's a 20 pound champ.

1025
01:00:34.090 --> 01:00:38.330
It does matter.
One 85 to two oh five is a huge jump.
That's fine guys.

1026
01:00:38.331 --> 01:00:40.880
Mason items anyway though.
They're still doing,
but it's,

1027
01:00:40.881 --> 01:00:44.000
you're not transcend three way.
You're not fighting.
If you were fighting,

1028
01:00:44.001 --> 01:00:46.940
you wouldn't be fine with know.
I know,
maybe for the fighters it could be better,

1029
01:00:46.941 --> 01:00:50.120
but for the sport we have enough weight.
I'm with Joe Man,

1030
01:00:50.121 --> 01:00:54.110
because a lot of these guys,
look,
we get heavyweight two oh six or two 65.

1031
01:00:54.111 --> 01:00:57.760
It's fucking insane.
It's a nice problem.
I like it.
No it's not.

1032
01:00:57.770 --> 01:01:01.700
It's interesting as a fighter,
it's not cool man.
As a fighter.
No audience member.

1033
01:01:01.701 --> 01:01:02.930
I'm going to him about the fighters I'm talking about.

1034
01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:06.590
You mean there's no fast track of his life that it is too much already.

1035
01:01:06.591 --> 01:01:09.020
We don't need more.
You do though.
Cause cause what about,

1036
01:01:09.021 --> 01:01:12.040
what about guy like Chris Weidman,
he's a bad motherfucker.

1037
01:01:12.070 --> 01:01:16.700
Like the champion right now.
He's doing 10 to 20 to 15 not big boy.

1038
01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:21.020
He's doing for himself.
He's 85.
He needs to uh,
in between the camps.

1039
01:01:21.021 --> 01:01:25.160
Maybe not blow up as much.
Not and you don't understand.
He's not blowing up.

1040
01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:26.330
He's dehydrated.

1041
01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:31.310
He's going to be five [inaudible] two or five [inaudible] at 200

1042
01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:34.250
200 huh?

1043
01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:38.420
What if his optimal weight to perform that 200 I liked the way classes the way

1044
01:01:38.421 --> 01:01:40.500
they are.
I don't want it anymore.
You don't find a problem.

1045
01:01:40.501 --> 01:01:43.420
Only you're going to saint,
you're not using any logic.
You just saying you like,

1046
01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:48.560
hey the heavyweight class that,
that argument,
that is ridiculous.

1047
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:51.320
Especially when you like the heavyweights are so poor.

1048
01:01:51.321 --> 01:01:53.000
They're six really great heavyweights.

1049
01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:56.840
And then the rest is just hard to got guys that are that big that are really

1050
01:01:56.841 --> 01:02:01.430
moving the envelope like that.
And,
and a lot of those guys are tool fibers.
Easy,

1051
01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:03.070
easy to fibers.

1052
01:02:03.290 --> 01:02:06.110
And so if you had a weight class that started at two 30 that was reasonable to

1053
01:02:06.111 --> 01:02:10.970
have a guy that's like a Frank Mir Santa Cruz for huge and have a guy fight at a

1054
01:02:10.971 --> 01:02:15.680
300 pound man on the day low.
Yeah.
It's up to Joe's point.

1055
01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:20.890
Do you care if Conor McGregor and Aldo fought at one 51 60 to any of us give a

1056
01:02:22.141 --> 01:02:24.760
fucking hair?
No,
I don't care.
We want to see the best we want.

1057
01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:27.570
I want to see the guys.
I want to see the best fighter at the best way.

1058
01:02:27.571 --> 01:02:30.150
Then you need more weight classes.
I mean like I'd rather see,

1059
01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:34.080
I ran see Aldo if all the fights better and faster and longer and with more

1060
01:02:34.081 --> 01:02:37.890
intensity at one 55 around see that classes.
I think the way classes,

1061
01:02:37.891 --> 01:02:41.160
the way they are forced up fights more instead of going,
well,

1062
01:02:41.161 --> 01:02:43.200
I'm in this weight class and I'm in this one.
I disagree.

1063
01:02:43.201 --> 01:02:46.230
You can see more super fights where people meet in the middle for a belt,

1064
01:02:46.410 --> 01:02:48.890
you know,
like it's what it should be.
This should be belts are bullshit.

1065
01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:49.170
That's it.

1066
01:02:49.170 --> 01:02:51.300
<v 0>Who Cares?
What are the best fighters of the best fighters?</v>

1067
01:02:51.301 --> 01:02:52.860
We all know who the best fighters are,
right?

1068
01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:55.590
Have the best fighters fight the best guys.
When you beat the best guys,

1069
01:02:55.591 --> 01:02:58.530
you're the best fighter.
This idea that champion and I,

1070
01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:01.890
I just think at a certain point in time,
who cares when,

1071
01:03:01.891 --> 01:03:05.250
if all has the belt look,
Mcgregor has,
let's be honest,

1072
01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:09.870
McGregor has an illegitimate belt.
Sure.
Okay made up.
It's a made up belt.

1073
01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:13.140
I mean we call it the interim belt,
but Aldo defended his title a year ago.

1074
01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:15.000
Stripping a guy because he doesn't,

1075
01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:18.810
because he can't get through a camp without getting injured is a part of MMA.

1076
01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.510
It's always been a part of them and bay.
But because of the marketing,

1077
01:03:21.511 --> 01:03:25.030
because the hype behind it,
because of the huge event,
the enormity,
the,
the,

1078
01:03:25.031 --> 01:03:28.110
the economics of the event,
they decided to make it an interim fight.

1079
01:03:28.110 --> 01:03:32.040
So he's got a title.
All those got a title.
They both have titles.

1080
01:03:32.041 --> 01:03:33.960
So they're fighting for the undisputed title.

1081
01:03:33.961 --> 01:03:37.680
So it becomes this big thing that they have to get on a scale and they have to

1082
01:03:37.681 --> 01:03:41.340
have a certain amount of mass in their body and then they rehydrate like crazy

1083
01:03:41.341 --> 01:03:43.920
and do their best to get back up to whatever the fuck they really are.

1084
01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:45.600
Wouldn't it be better if they just fought?

1085
01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:49.020
I like big Conor is we know have big Aldo.

1086
01:03:49.021 --> 01:03:51.820
Is this go fight guys that make sense?

1087
01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:56.040
If you didn't have belts like that or do you have,
uh,
mitigated value to them?

1088
01:03:56.340 --> 01:04:00.360
You could have catch fight for everybody.
Yeah.
You could go,
okay judge Jones,

1089
01:04:00.361 --> 01:04:03.270
what do you want to fight Weidman at?
Or what do you like or whatever.

1090
01:04:03.271 --> 01:04:06.800
You could do any of that stuff with every single fight and then it would be real

1091
01:04:06.830 --> 01:04:10.190
<v 1>matchups that was that he has off adds another dimension.</v>

1092
01:04:10.191 --> 01:04:13.550
So fighting to the biggest thing is that it does become,

1093
01:04:13.551 --> 01:04:15.200
if you're sucking inordinate amounts of weight,

1094
01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:20.230
it kind of a part of being a champion then has to be how good is your nutrition

1095
01:04:21.651 --> 01:04:24.140
program,
how good is your weight loss program?

1096
01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:27.260
And that becomes a huge part of fighting when it probably shouldn't.

1097
01:04:27.290 --> 01:04:30.590
What about more brain trauma?
Correct.
Cause cause the other homeboy,

1098
01:04:30.591 --> 01:04:34.570
Jeff Novitsky was saying that it takes 72 hours to rehydrate your brain.

1099
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:39.440
So even with Ivy,
no belt,
you guys are saying no belts,
just catch.
Wait no,
no,

1100
01:04:39.441 --> 01:04:41.990
I want belts but let's do more divisions.

1101
01:04:42.050 --> 01:04:46.440
So guys aren't killing themselves to make the best athlete in the UFC.

1102
01:04:46.441 --> 01:04:50.510
He's amazing and they're doing an amazing job and like Jay likes add this and

1103
01:04:50.511 --> 01:04:51.230
add that.

1104
01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:53.410
I don't even funny if you took your mask off and you weren't Eddie and you were

1105
01:04:53.411 --> 01:04:58.070
actually Dana [inaudible] does.

1106
01:04:58.130 --> 01:05:01.460
There's so much good shit happening in the UFC too much that you can't even keep

1107
01:05:01.461 --> 01:05:04.400
trying not to add more weight to.
Doesn't matter.
They take away the belts.

1108
01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:08.450
<v 0>This is the logical discussion because not that they're not doing all these</v>

1109
01:05:08.451 --> 01:05:12.920
reasons why more weight classes would be beneficial and not cutting weight will

1110
01:05:12.921 --> 01:05:14.600
be beneficial and you're like,
everything's great.

1111
01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:18.010
It's a crazy way it looked was maybe he's super

1112
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:21.040
<v 4>positive.
He might be super positive me one of those beers.
Right.</v>

1113
01:05:23.370 --> 01:05:27.100
Good beer by the way,
take,
you know what?
I appreciate you.
Yeah,

1114
01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:31.360
it would be safer and it'd be easier.
It'd be better for the fight.

1115
01:05:31.361 --> 01:05:33.700
We get better performances if they weren't killing themselves.

1116
01:05:36.310 --> 01:05:41.190
That's the name of the company and trying to get me in trouble.
Okay,

1117
01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:43.660
what are we going to look?
What's going on open about Chad lips,

1118
01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:47.620
perfect screw yas fucked up judges and all that shit.

1119
01:05:47.621 --> 01:05:50.260
You never know who's gonna win.
Fuck yeah.
That's adds to the excitement.

1120
01:05:50.261 --> 01:05:54.970
I love that.
Please.
And what he has.
Okay,

1121
01:05:54.971 --> 01:05:57.220
guys,
back off.
I'm appreciative.

1122
01:05:58.290 --> 01:06:00.220
I love the belts and all that shit.

1123
01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:05.370
I love the fact that if you're a champion and,
and uh,
uh,
knowing that if you,

1124
01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:08.710
if you don't take this fight,
if you try to back off for whatever reason,

1125
01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:11.920
maybe maybe you fake an injury,
maybe you don't,
they can injury.

1126
01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:15.010
Maybe you don't want to get busted with steroids and there,
whatever it is.

1127
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:18.730
I think it's good for them to know that if you fuck around,

1128
01:06:18.790 --> 01:06:22.810
we're going to strip that fucking belt.
I like that.
Oh,
I'm not gonna fight.
Oh,

1129
01:06:22.811 --> 01:06:25.940
I hurt my ankle.
Oh,
I hurt my shoulder.
You know what I mean?
You never know.

1130
01:06:26.090 --> 01:06:29.050
It's nice to know that you can't do that shit anytime you want.

1131
01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:31.540
When take your fucking belt and we're going to make you guys fight.

1132
01:06:31.570 --> 01:06:34.960
That's ridiculous.
But the change champion,
a champion gets hurt and training.

1133
01:06:35.110 --> 01:06:37.990
If they are clean and they actually do get hurt and they can't fight,

1134
01:06:38.170 --> 01:06:40.990
you're just going to take their belts.
ADDS excitement.
No,

1135
01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:46.450
you're talking crazy.
Oh,
come on.
You guys start a fighters' union

1136
01:06:51.350 --> 01:06:55.240
trouble.
He listen.
I love what's going on.
I love this shit.
And you love it too.

1137
01:06:55.241 --> 01:06:58.420
I haven't fucking podcast because he'd been watching the fights.

1138
01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:05.150
Who's the woman who's fighting is a better question for you.
Is that,

1139
01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.870
is that an American black guy or is that a person that black guy firsthand?

1140
01:07:09.310 --> 01:07:13.980
It's hard to tell.
Oh,
he's a nice right hand.
Oh,
your shit rowing.

1141
01:07:14.010 --> 01:07:18.370
He's no joke.
It would be,
it's good to be a handful and the right.

1142
01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:21.460
You know what I mean?
Guys that got the Jersey is color coded by the way.

1143
01:07:21.461 --> 01:07:24.190
Eddie said it give you a little heads up.
Green on the shorts.

1144
01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:29.700
One guy where it was like a green out in the stores to make them all with the

1145
01:07:29.701 --> 01:07:34.090
Santa Ana.
Ooh.
By the way,
has anybody worn,
like,

1146
01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:37.000
have you ever seen someone wearing like those Reebok fighter kits?

1147
01:07:37.001 --> 01:07:39.280
Have you ever run into anybody in the street?
Haven't seen one.

1148
01:07:39.490 --> 01:07:43.470
I got the pants when I was doing an Andrew Craig.
Come on Emily.

1149
01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:48.450
Oh yeah.
They had them all laid out in a locker and wow.
They make you a snake.

1150
01:07:48.490 --> 01:07:52.270
Oh Damn.
I missed it.
Dad,

1151
01:07:52.271 --> 01:07:55.800
did they make you wear sneakers?
10% socks too.
Everything.
Only my underwear.

1152
01:07:55.801 --> 01:07:58.840
Socks.
Socks.
Wow.
Oh,
he pulled guard.

1153
01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:01.810
The only kid I've ever seen was that Aubrey Marcus's house.

1154
01:08:02.430 --> 01:08:04.390
It was hanging in your closet and I was like,
oh cool.

1155
01:08:05.170 --> 01:08:08.740
I saved my shit from the Ben Saunders fight.
It's all bloody.
I saved that shit.

1156
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:15.380
That'd be brutal if they made you give it up and then they sold it.
Sign it.

1157
01:08:15.381 --> 01:08:16.370
They sell it at Ebay.

1158
01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:20.520
<v 1>Warren kits.
Oh Hey.
That's your heart.</v>

1159
01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:23.740
It's going to ruin it.
Yes.
Once over,

1160
01:08:23.790 --> 01:08:27.480
and this is definitely going to ruin his brain.
All these count,
all these counts,

1161
01:08:27.530 --> 01:08:30.590
but the downward elbow right down that for non trend now though is a bad

1162
01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:35.660
motherfucker.
Those aren't that hard.
They'll stop it though.
Shit Bitch.
Damn.

1163
01:08:35.750 --> 01:08:40.280
Wow.
Nice.
Holy Shit.

1164
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:45.320
Francisco tree.
Now Aldo,
where is a Saskatoon by the way?
Ask a ton on the map,

1165
01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:48.810
isn't it?
He gets the capitalist this catch.
Was that what it is?

1166
01:08:48.811 --> 01:08:53.570
Is that Hey Chris?
Beall already flat.
Right.
Sounds good.
What happened Chris?

1167
01:08:53.571 --> 01:08:58.420
Beall fun.
Is that what you said?
I'll find that a black guy,
right?
Yes,
man.

1168
01:08:58.450 --> 01:09:02.600
I was watching Gracie worlds with Tate met at loss.

1169
01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:05.780
I didn't keep track of the prelims,
ma'am.
Sad that Sam stock.

1170
01:09:05.781 --> 01:09:09.260
I came to first around what happened to Chris Beall.

1171
01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:14.270
I'm trying to find out right now.
Prelim results.
Fuck man.

1172
01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:18.410
Super Bummer for Sam.
Sam retired.
He retired in the octagon after the fight.

1173
01:09:18.890 --> 01:09:23.210
Um,
man,
uh,
do do,
do,

1174
01:09:23.211 --> 01:09:28.211
do to Arantes beat Joe boy tapped them out.

1175
01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:31.160
Wait.
Crispier lost.
Uh,
no.

1176
01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:34.920
Jewel boy is not Chris Beall said your boy.
Hold on.

1177
01:09:35.090 --> 01:09:39.110
He said he beat her boy.
He's watching her spiel.
I think you wanted decision.

1178
01:09:39.111 --> 01:09:43.250
I think I'll tell you right now.
Um,
no.

1179
01:09:43.251 --> 01:09:46.940
Be a lost decision,
Joe.
Yeah,
I wasn't watching Khloe.
20th.

1180
01:09:46.941 --> 01:09:50.120
We'll just split decision.
It was close by.
Yeah.
Oh No,
no,

1181
01:09:50.121 --> 01:09:53.210
it wasn't split decision.
29,
28,
29,
28,

1182
01:09:53.211 --> 01:09:56.660
27 30 for the Greek gentlemen.

1183
01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:00.850
See you trained with him and he's been coming.
Okay.
Bad motherfucker.

1184
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:05.240
Crispier hell yeah,
he is,
dude.
It's heartbreaking,
man.
You guys know him.

1185
01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:08.150
He's such a good dude and he just can't take a shot anymore.

1186
01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:11.870
And he's a good dude.
He,
but whenever we've seen it so many times,

1187
01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:15.290
guys that had of an iron chin and then all of a sudden they reach a certain

1188
01:10:15.291 --> 01:10:19.760
point,
they can't take it anymore.
And the guy that's always cut a lot of weight,

1189
01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:23.790
you know,
like a real legend,
but always,
always cut a lot of weight and like,
yeah.

1190
01:10:24.330 --> 01:10:27.260
And then that,
that stuff's real.
It stays with you.
And then the training,

1191
01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:31.270
you know,
like you always train,
always being hit.
There's never a rest.
Yeah.

1192
01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:36.110
It was interesting.
You guys watch the ultimate insider,
Jon Anik shell good show.

1193
01:10:36.170 --> 01:10:37.530
And they had,
I were shot on,

1194
01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:41.390
Rashad was talking about how he used to train now he trains now and they used to

1195
01:10:41.391 --> 01:10:44.300
think that you had to beat yourself up so that you know you could be able to

1196
01:10:44.301 --> 01:10:48.980
fight.
And he's like,
no,
that doesn't really work.
He's like,
it's a good theory.

1197
01:10:49.050 --> 01:10:51.920
Yeah,
it's good in theory,
but in actual practice you just can't do that.

1198
01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:53.810
I think the thing is,
I mean the smart way,

1199
01:10:53.811 --> 01:10:55.830
I think that there's only a few guys that are doing it,
but the,

1200
01:10:55.831 --> 01:10:58.740
and I think Rhonda probably does it,
but,
um,

1201
01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:03.650
the only good thing about sparring a lot is that you,

1202
01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:05.810
it's not like you're staying sharp.
I think you're just learning.

1203
01:11:05.811 --> 01:11:08.720
You're tough and you learn,
you can withstand stuff.
You're not getting better.

1204
01:11:08.721 --> 01:11:11.450
But to hit mits,
to work on timing,
all that stuff.

1205
01:11:11.451 --> 01:11:13.620
Like I think after the first couple,
three years of your fight,

1206
01:11:13.621 --> 01:11:18.080
you don't need to spar ever.
What was Kennedy Down?
You just don't,
yeah.

1207
01:11:18.090 --> 01:11:21.130
Tim Kennedy we're talking about and he goes on.
I don't spire it all.
Yeah,

1208
01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:22.340
he was what I wanted and needed.

1209
01:11:22.370 --> 01:11:25.200
I can take a shot because I've been fighting for how long he's,

1210
01:11:25.201 --> 01:11:27.230
I'm gonna I don't spar at all.
I just feel he's,

1211
01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:30.270
the only time we go live is when I'm inside the octagon.

1212
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:34.110
And I've heard this from a number of fighters and there's a trend in NFL too,

1213
01:11:34.111 --> 01:11:37.440
in college.
There's a lot of college teams.
They do not hit any more.

1214
01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:40.200
There's no more life practice.
These are top,
top teams.

1215
01:11:40.201 --> 01:11:44.310
Don't you pay a price though when,
when you're going full and distance and like,

1216
01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:47.570
I dunno.
Well,
when he doesn't make a difference in speed,
distance and deform,

1217
01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:49.980
you've been doing it for that long.
Do you really?
You know what I'm saying?

1218
01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:53.130
And you're hitting targets.
You're you,
you've got a guy hit and miss.

1219
01:11:53.131 --> 01:11:54.870
It's just like hitting somebody in the face,
right.

1220
01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:56.370
You know your footwork is the same.

1221
01:11:56.371 --> 01:11:59.100
You know the guys that are holding mitts for these guys on the top or the

1222
01:11:59.101 --> 01:12:03.040
fucking finest fighters in the world that are now holding Mintzberg simulated

1223
01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:06.990
and get like a,
a Bang Ludwig or a Mike Winkeljohn,

1224
01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:12.030
Brandon Gibson.
It's like those guys are fucking killers.
Don't get it.

1225
01:12:12.270 --> 01:12:15.360
It has some serious power.
He is so frightening.

1226
01:12:15.361 --> 01:12:19.170
I'd go into the gym and he'd been in the early in the morning and holding it and

1227
01:12:19.171 --> 01:12:21.850
like,
and I'd hear what,
what,
what,
what,
what?

1228
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.950
Like just somebody beating the fuck out of a bag and it's just him back there.

1229
01:12:25.951 --> 01:12:30.240
It's dark.
It's so fucking eerie.
And there's a bag taking a beating.

1230
01:12:30.270 --> 01:12:34.740
He was a world champ,
right?
We're multiple times kicked by.

1231
01:12:34.741 --> 01:12:38.460
Bad,
bad.
Let's compare them.
Compare them to so many power wise,
like a Melvin,

1232
01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:42.360
Melvin Manhoef kind of,
I don't know.

1233
01:12:42.361 --> 01:12:47.100
What I heard is ridiculous kicks.
Daniel,
you're looking at him going,
I go,

1234
01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:48.930
what's your workout?
What are you doing on the bag?
He goes,

1235
01:12:48.931 --> 01:12:53.850
I'm doing nine minute rounds and,
and it's just nonstop.
You don't,
you don't.

1236
01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:58.140
It's like,
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.
It's like the cadences fucking crazy.

1237
01:12:58.170 --> 01:12:59.220
How big is he big guy?

1238
01:12:59.230 --> 01:13:03.000
Was he a heavyweight or one 85 one 98 he's probably not even that big,

1239
01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:06.290
but I just keep hearing from people that go,
dude,
you,

1240
01:13:06.291 --> 01:13:10.110
you need to see that guy kicked the bag.
I say,
they say it's ridiculous power.

1241
01:13:10.890 --> 01:13:14.240
Such a good dude.
The work ethic is,
I mean it's amazing that he's a,

1242
01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:18.930
he's one of the toughest,
kindest,
most gracious dudes ever helps everybody.
Well,

1243
01:13:18.931 --> 01:13:22.710
he,
he's the one training Holly Holmes,
right?
Yeah.
He's Holly Holmes.
Been Holly.

1244
01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:28.100
I mean he's been Holly's coach for four for a [inaudible] Jamie.

1245
01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:33.000
She was a boxer for try not to talk over each other though because we've got a

1246
01:13:33.001 --> 01:13:37.800
lot of mikes going on.
We got five,
seven legs.
Um,
yeah.
I don't know man.

1247
01:13:37.890 --> 01:13:40.540
Um,
the Holly Holm fight is not,
the,

1248
01:13:40.570 --> 01:13:43.080
is intriguing to me as a Amanda Nunez would be.

1249
01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:46.440
I would just like to see Holly get maybe another one or two warmups because

1250
01:13:46.441 --> 01:13:50.280
we've seen her in the octagon and she's just not putting it together yet to get

1251
01:13:50.281 --> 01:13:53.640
to that level of Rhonda and our big issue is the grappling,
you know,

1252
01:13:53.790 --> 01:13:56.730
that's a huge issue for the Rondo.
Yes.

1253
01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:01.680
She's very patient too.
That's,
that's not really gonna work against Ronda.

1254
01:14:01.681 --> 01:14:03.540
She's going to run,
is going to come right after.

1255
01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:07.350
Well that she won't have time to be patient.
It's another thing,
another drawback,

1256
01:14:07.351 --> 01:14:11.350
I think being such a fine boxer in that arena,
you can be patient.

1257
01:14:11.351 --> 01:14:14.110
You can't eat it.
It's a,
it's a long drawn out battle.

1258
01:14:14.170 --> 01:14:17.350
Rhonda doesn't fight that way.
Who knows though?
Man,
you never know.

1259
01:14:17.351 --> 01:14:20.440
I mean maybe Holly,
because her standup is so much more refined.

1260
01:14:20.710 --> 01:14:24.010
She's been doing it for so much longer.
Maybe she can keep Rhonda away from her.

1261
01:14:24.970 --> 01:14:29.830
Let's fuck knows I'm serious.
I just think,
I just think honestly,

1262
01:14:30.190 --> 01:14:33.340
the real problem is,
is there's a lack of talent.
Do I?
Like I said,

1263
01:14:33.341 --> 01:14:35.320
I'm not mad at the UFC.
I get it,
man.
Let's,

1264
01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:37.360
let's at least let the world know who Holly is.

1265
01:14:37.361 --> 01:14:40.240
She didn't get all this marketing.
Ron is only a fight for so long.

1266
01:14:40.270 --> 01:14:44.940
Holly is a bad ass.
Whoever's managing Cyborg.
I think there's plenty of criminal.

1267
01:14:45.010 --> 01:14:49.340
Rhonda is way better.
He's made.
That's what I know.
He fired.
She fired him.
Yes.

1268
01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:52.150
They still train together though.
She needs to get with Mc Hammer.

1269
01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:57.530
Go ahead and go.
That was,
he was doing that for a while,
right?
My manager's son.

1270
01:14:58.330 --> 01:15:02.030
How's an MC Hammer?
I was an MC hammer,
right

1271
01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:08.920
in a rap video,
but I wasn't dancing.
What did you do in this room?
He's not in a,

1272
01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:13.170
in MMA no more.
What happened?
Uh,
you can't test this.

1273
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:16.690
Du,
Du,
Du,
Du du Du.
Seriously though.

1274
01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:19.390
I wondered what happened to Mc Hammer's he's still,
uh,

1275
01:15:19.810 --> 01:15:23.530
he's not involved in killing the gay man.
He's an investor in Facebook,

1276
01:15:23.531 --> 01:15:28.070
sales force,
gold money for gold or whatever it goes for goals.

1277
01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:31.770
Oh,
so he's blown up,
dude.
No more MMA as a businessman.

1278
01:15:32.730 --> 01:15:37.440
So I think it really perform anymore.
He does.
He does,
man.

1279
01:15:37.441 --> 01:15:42.430
I just saw him a digital to Vegas for the next 20 years.
Wait,

1280
01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:44.020
wait,
wait.
He went,
you went to see him.

1281
01:15:44.530 --> 01:15:47.320
You know he came here and you left the house.

1282
01:15:47.990 --> 01:15:50.130
I worked with a man to go see.
No,
he,

1283
01:15:50.131 --> 01:15:53.020
he's got all those big sponsors that everyone was giving me shit for.

1284
01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:56.560
All of those came from Mc Hammer,
salesforce,
all that momentum and had the pants.

1285
01:15:56.590 --> 01:16:00.570
AIRBNB.
No,
I wish he sells out.

1286
01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:04.910
He sells out in like Africa and shit.
You know,
like he was like,

1287
01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:09.940
that was the funniest thing.
[inaudible]
and shit.

1288
01:16:10.030 --> 01:16:13.840
Well like in China,
expendable 17 huge.
But here we're like,
what?

1289
01:16:13.850 --> 01:16:16.870
This is a good fight.
Coattail and Berkman.
This is a good fight.

1290
01:16:16.871 --> 01:16:18.730
It's a throwback to 2006

1291
01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:24.010
the numbers he does in the Congo,
I'm serious.
This holy Shit.

1292
01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:29.210
Open air jungles,
Jujitsu with the GE.

1293
01:16:29.211 --> 01:16:33.550
Every day I improved with the g notice I'm doing things and no one can do in the

1294
01:16:33.551 --> 01:16:36.730
fight because they don't have the grip.
No,
he did not say that.

1295
01:16:38.410 --> 01:16:40.230
This is three years since became a black belt.

1296
01:16:40.231 --> 01:16:43.560
Today is going to give him the first black stripe Charles on the van.

1297
01:16:43.570 --> 01:16:46.900
He had that piece of tape and his fucking color.
That was awesome.

1298
01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:52.360
I'll get us learned to Technia to you go.
Oh my friend,
my friend.

1299
01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:54.130
I think the girls in the game too right now,

1300
01:16:54.131 --> 01:16:56.920
they got to realize they got way more power than they think because there is

1301
01:16:56.921 --> 01:17:01.770
such a small amount of them that are,
I mean how you both fighters.

1302
01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:05.020
Yeah,
man.
Right.
I don't.

1303
01:17:05.890 --> 01:17:09.920
Who else are you going to get when you're looking at at women to fight Rhonda.

1304
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:13.580
Holly Holmes is the baddest woman walk in.
I think she's bad ass.

1305
01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:16.820
I think it's early for whatever,
whatever,
however it take.

1306
01:17:16.821 --> 01:17:20.670
How many more out there?
Five tape my eggs like that.

1307
01:17:20.690 --> 01:17:23.080
You have seen the tough show,
so Rhonda could,

1308
01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:26.480
my mom could fight Rhonda at UFC when Itunes,
they'd still sell it.

1309
01:17:26.481 --> 01:17:31.310
Sell as many papers.
It does not.
He fights.
That's true.
It does not matter.

1310
01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:36.200
Best Coin.
We don't,
America didn't know the fuck she is.
Holly Holmes Eda.

1311
01:17:36.230 --> 01:17:40.340
We know she is [inaudible] still going to sell this bitch out Jones when he was

1312
01:17:40.341 --> 01:17:43.330
in his prime and he's just starting their matter yet does not.

1313
01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:48.220
Roy Jones world tour.
You know we're,
we're paying to see Ronda beat up.
Whoever.

1314
01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:50.750
Ron is going to have to do things now she's going to have to do like a judo

1315
01:17:50.751 --> 01:17:52.940
master in the day and then have like

1316
01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:56.960
basketball.
That's right.

1317
01:17:56.990 --> 01:18:00.670
He played basketball the day of a world title defense the day of,

1318
01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:06.080
not the day before day of played basketball and then went out.

1319
01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:09.390
Whoops.
In acid at night.
One of my favorite stories about that is like a,

1320
01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:13.580
is John Jones chasing a guy down a robber,
a purse.
Snatcher in New York City.

1321
01:18:13.730 --> 01:18:17.380
Fucking rubs him down and tackles him,
retrieves the person.

1322
01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:20.630
Lady holds the guy for the cops and then goes,
who's he knock out Shogun,

1323
01:18:20.631 --> 01:18:23.670
right for the title.
Oh,
the youngest ever champion.

1324
01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:26.440
That's like a made up story that John Jones,

1325
01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:28.990
someone's making that Jon Jones movie writer.

1326
01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:33.130
He's back training by the way is there's footage of him train at Jackson's went

1327
01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:36.370
right away.
Right after he got in that trouble.
Mr Winklejohn was like,
you're,

1328
01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:39.110
you're back in help all the rest of the guys,
whatever you're doing,
you're doing,

1329
01:18:39.111 --> 01:18:42.650
but help these guys.
And he was in right.
He's a good,
he's a stand up dude man.

1330
01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:46.130
The whole division is like ye he's training again.

1331
01:18:46.370 --> 01:18:49.250
I saw him doing crunches.
Well here's the problem.

1332
01:18:49.251 --> 01:18:51.710
Like what's going to happen with him criminally?
You know,

1333
01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:53.450
it's a legit running away from,

1334
01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:57.940
it's a big fucking deal running away from a tonality,
right Joey?
Cause she got,

1335
01:18:58.370 --> 01:19:01.700
she got bones broken.
She's a serious injury.

1336
01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:04.130
If there's factory he didn't and not only that,

1337
01:19:04.131 --> 01:19:07.760
he was of mine to come back and get whatever he needed from his car and then

1338
01:19:07.761 --> 01:19:11.210
leave again.
The problem with that is there go,
I mean,

1339
01:19:11.211 --> 01:19:12.530
I'm not saying he should lie,

1340
01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:15.980
but there's a defense that you could always use in a car accident that you got

1341
01:19:15.981 --> 01:19:16.940
hit so hard in the head.

1342
01:19:16.941 --> 01:19:19.550
You didn't know what the fuck you're doing and then you left.

1343
01:19:19.850 --> 01:19:23.960
You know when no one could use that argument better than a guy like Jon Jones.

1344
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:28.440
Why is it taking so long?
I don't know how long it to figure this out.

1345
01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:32.810
I hate to say this.
That's why they always say,

1346
01:19:32.811 --> 01:19:35.810
if you are in a situation and you're drunk,

1347
01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:39.400
people in the know will run away from the scene.
Sure.
As you can say,

1348
01:19:39.401 --> 01:19:40.880
I hit my head and I was disoriented.

1349
01:19:40.881 --> 01:19:45.110
There's no way to prove that you weren't exactly.
Scene is not.

1350
01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:48.650
You can fit the defense and it,
Ryan's is,
I didn't know where I was.

1351
01:19:48.910 --> 01:19:52.250
I know he came back.
He got cash.
The numbers,

1352
01:19:52.340 --> 01:19:55.700
the difference with this is that somebody was hurt.
Makes it felonious.

1353
01:19:55.701 --> 01:19:58.970
If you're just leaving the scene,
not as bad a deal as a drunk driving,

1354
01:19:59.390 --> 01:20:02.390
hurting somebody leaving the scene.
Dude,
way worse.

1355
01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:07.140
I love the fact you used the word felonious.
Munk come with it.

1356
01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:08.330
That should be a rapper.

1357
01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:13.050
<v 0>Felonious monk.
You know I set up felonious monk probably is a rat.</v>

1358
01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:16.220
I bet.
I bet you're right.
Let's look it up right now.
I bet you're totally right.

1359
01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:19.890
Joan's bet you're wrong.
I bet that's the easy Eddie.
That's your shit.

1360
01:20:19.930 --> 01:20:23.790
Joe Shapiro.
Come back.
Take for dooms bell and take fucking,

1361
01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:27.460
that's exactly what's gonna happen.
He's gonna come for lunch.

1362
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:33.960
Yeah,
there's the guy,
his name's felonious monk.
Monk was it.

1363
01:20:33.961 --> 01:20:37.360
It was a great pianist and he went crazy.
The loneliness,

1364
01:20:38.090 --> 01:20:42.660
just my crazy great jazz piano actually might try the best jazz pianist.

1365
01:20:42.690 --> 01:20:45.470
You can keep them.
How about that?
Genius.
How about that?

1366
01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:47.520
You've got the nicest I've ever seen.

1367
01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:51.270
I went to the Le La County Museum of art the other day.

1368
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:55.590
Save Your fucking brain cells.
Save your time.

1369
01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:58.500
I want to show you some pictures.
There was a,
I'm not bullshitting.

1370
01:20:58.501 --> 01:21:02.970
There's a plexiglass box on the ground.
It was roped off I go.

1371
01:21:02.971 --> 01:21:04.830
Is that the art?
That's the art.

1372
01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:09.990
It is a plexi glass box and there's some bullshit written on the wall.

1373
01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:12.950
What this box is supposed to represent,
it's a fucking box.

1374
01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:14.820
I paid money to see a box.

1375
01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:18.360
It's a box where your kids born out of their mind.

1376
01:21:18.361 --> 01:21:19.760
They were ready to run through walls.

1377
01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:23.470
There's a critic who said the reason that those kinds of things sold for

1378
01:21:23.471 --> 01:21:27.240
millions of dollars because a small group of people who are modern art

1379
01:21:27.241 --> 01:21:31.110
aficionados wanted to be and feel really exclusive.

1380
01:21:31.111 --> 01:21:35.050
It was this Angela hauls ass holes.
We go back.

1381
01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:38.370
The art there is so bad.
There's one,
one piece of art.

1382
01:21:38.371 --> 01:21:42.510
There's a screen that has 18 different separate videos playing at the same time.

1383
01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:45.540
It's just people like throwing a ball to each other.

1384
01:21:45.690 --> 01:21:50.430
One guys juggling one guy smoking a cigarette is so fucking dumb.

1385
01:21:50.730 --> 01:21:54.150
It's so dumb.
It made me angry.
I was like,
I can't show you.

1386
01:21:54.151 --> 01:21:56.010
Fucks made me look at this.

1387
01:21:56.250 --> 01:22:00.180
One of them was supposed to represent tar and feathering,

1388
01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:03.480
so it was like a black background with some feathers on it.
Like,

1389
01:22:03.550 --> 01:22:07.070
I'll fucking kill you a fucking kill you if you put this in a museum,

1390
01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:08.450
paid to get in there and day.

1391
01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:11.490
I didn't have to pay either because I'm a fucking resident of La County.

1392
01:22:11.610 --> 01:22:14.670
I could've got in for free.
I got to be a celebrity.
I'm like,
what's contribute?

1393
01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:15.440
Let's contribute.

1394
01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:20.440
So we paid to get in and there's nothing more maddening than it modern art

1395
01:22:20.551 --> 01:22:20.941
exhibit,

1396
01:22:20.941 --> 01:22:24.420
especially the art that came out of the 60s and Seventies Rauschenberg and those

1397
01:22:24.421 --> 01:22:27.990
guys.
And not only that man fuck people that were so fucking pretentious.

1398
01:22:29.490 --> 01:22:30.810
There's one of them is junk.

1399
01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:34.890
They have an art exhibit just they called junk and you'd go there and it's just

1400
01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:39.600
a garbage they've glued in frames.
It's so fucking stupid.

1401
01:22:39.810 --> 01:22:42.450
There's someplace that they just opened where they opened it to a lot of street

1402
01:22:42.451 --> 01:22:45.960
artists and they just had blank walls in there and then they let that go,

1403
01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:48.900
which I think has huge potential to be bad ass.
Well,

1404
01:22:48.901 --> 01:22:52.240
some street artists are fucking super town.
You know,

1405
01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:57.550
Justin Blue Blues.

1406
01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:01.170
He did a place by clutch,
um,
that these,

1407
01:23:01.490 --> 01:23:05.350
he is wicked red bands,
like red bands.
The one who really term,

1408
01:23:05.410 --> 01:23:07.750
like he texts me,
he goes,
hey dude,

1409
01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:11.470
because Justin LewisLewis' daughter trains at my school and I don't know any

1410
01:23:11.471 --> 01:23:15.790
artists.
I know Todd white.
That's it.
And uh,
I didn't know who Justin boots.

1411
01:23:15.930 --> 01:23:19.600
I'm not,
I'm not big in the art world.
I don't know.
He,
he uh,
he's in,
uh,

1412
01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:22.690
he's in a painter of lots of shit,

1413
01:23:22.691 --> 01:23:27.691
but he's known for painting hip hop artists and doing a weird looking like

1414
01:23:28.301 --> 01:23:32.650
paintings of them that are insane.
He's got books and you know,

1415
01:23:32.830 --> 01:23:37.400
anyways,
um,
what the band wanted me to,
uh,

1416
01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:39.220
well that's what you're about to do.
His own podcast.

1417
01:23:39.221 --> 01:23:40.120
I've been telling them forever.

1418
01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:42.900
Do you have all these interests that I don't have in there?

1419
01:23:42.910 --> 01:23:45.490
Like you should do your own podcasts.
You'd be good at a podcast.

1420
01:23:45.491 --> 01:23:48.040
Just start yelling thing.
He doesn't do his own,

1421
01:23:49.250 --> 01:23:52.680
doesn't have six Terry,
here's this thing called dysentery,

1422
01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:56.620
but it's just gets girls on and gets drunk.
And harasses him what it's called,

1423
01:23:56.621 --> 01:23:59.440
the sexual harassment of Brian Red Bat.
That's the name of the podcast.

1424
01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:02.700
What I'm saying is you should do like a show where he has guests on call with

1425
01:24:02.701 --> 01:24:07.210
the red band show that no he doesn't.
No,

1426
01:24:07.211 --> 01:24:10.300
he doesn't have any single podcasts.
That's like the red band show.

1427
01:24:10.301 --> 01:24:12.880
He does kill Tony.
He does all of them with other people,

1428
01:24:13.090 --> 01:24:17.200
but he would be good one on one.
He'll,
he knows what he knows that he's,

1429
01:24:17.201 --> 01:24:21.010
that he's like the engineer guys like the doctor Dre of podcast.
Well,

1430
01:24:21.011 --> 01:24:24.070
he doesn't even act as an engineer on my show anymore.
He'd sit says,
oh,

1431
01:24:24.071 --> 01:24:25.870
like a cohost.
You know,

1432
01:24:25.871 --> 01:24:28.990
I think he's better off when he's not distracted by computers in front of them

1433
01:24:28.991 --> 01:24:32.440
and all this stuff.
First of all,
he's so add,
he'll just start googling things.

1434
01:24:32.441 --> 01:24:36.070
I'll catch him going on his Facebook and like we're doing a show,

1435
01:24:36.190 --> 01:24:39.490
like put your phone down just for a show.
But that's how his mind is.

1436
01:24:39.491 --> 01:24:41.950
Like if you go to dinner with him,
he's like that.
If he's like,

1437
01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:45.610
but that's also why he's got so much information on stuff that's going on in the

1438
01:24:45.611 --> 01:24:47.830
Internet and you know,
I mean he'll tell you,
look,

1439
01:24:47.831 --> 01:24:49.810
I'm looking for things to talk about like yeah,

1440
01:24:49.811 --> 01:24:54.140
but you got to kind of like talk in an actual conversation.

1441
01:24:55.390 --> 01:24:55.991
It's not as fun.

1442
01:24:55.991 --> 01:24:59.620
But what I'm saying is he would probably recognize that more if he was doing his

1443
01:24:59.621 --> 01:25:02.400
own show.
Like if you did like the red band show and it's like it's not,

1444
01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:03.460
you don't have time for it.

1445
01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:07.570
You only do my show like once or twice at the most a week and you have all
these,

1446
01:25:07.571 --> 01:25:09.640
other days you don't have another job like you should do.

1447
01:25:09.850 --> 01:25:11.080
It's like you could be really good at it.

1448
01:25:11.081 --> 01:25:16.081
I think he would really have a huge market because I think he's a weird guy.

1449
01:25:16.451 --> 01:25:20.710
He's funny.
He says a lot of crazy silly shit.
He's got a lot of varied,

1450
01:25:20.711 --> 01:25:21.700
bizarre interests.

1451
01:25:21.701 --> 01:25:25.270
I think it would help him like it would help him like so people could see like

1452
01:25:25.271 --> 01:25:28.690
what he's really all about,
what people like about them.
It'd be better for him.

1453
01:25:29.890 --> 01:25:33.250
It helped his comedy for sure.
Yeah.
Fuck yeah.
And then like a guy like this guy,

1454
01:25:33.251 --> 01:25:34.510
like this artist or you know,

1455
01:25:34.690 --> 01:25:37.840
it would expose people to things that he's into cars.
He's into a lot of,
uh,

1456
01:25:38.260 --> 01:25:40.650
I mean I find out about a lot of stuff from them.
Yeah.

1457
01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:42.880
All of that is another thing to stop doing that.

1458
01:25:42.881 --> 01:25:45.850
And he had a regular time and he had to be true to somebody else.

1459
01:25:45.851 --> 01:25:50.620
He invited a guest,
it would hone it.
Oh No,
did we just lose direct TV?

1460
01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:54.160
Oh Wow.
DIRECTV almost shit.

1461
01:25:54.161 --> 01:25:57.970
Couple 35 year olds going at it.
He lost.
He had to suck a lot of ways.

1462
01:25:57.971 --> 01:26:02.530
I think that for almost everybody that is involved in standup comedy,

1463
01:26:02.531 --> 01:26:05.180
doing your own podcast is a great idea.
Unless you don't need a,

1464
01:26:05.181 --> 01:26:09.920
you're a Russell Peters or Louis C K why bother?
You know?
But for anybody else,

1465
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:13.340
look at guy like me or for Bill Burr,
I'm sure it's been gigantic for his career.

1466
01:26:13.730 --> 01:26:16.860
For a Joey Diaz has been gigantic,
has been Diana.
For you,

1467
01:26:16.861 --> 01:26:19.390
it's been doing it for you.
For me,
it's been fucking amazing.

1468
01:26:19.410 --> 01:26:22.220
Been a lifesaver for me,
man.
For me too.
I think it's a,

1469
01:26:22.221 --> 01:26:23.620
it's the best form of communication.

1470
01:26:23.621 --> 01:26:27.140
I just think more people should define what's true to them.

1471
01:26:27.141 --> 01:26:30.200
And there's like some people that are were I've seen like I know podcasts where

1472
01:26:30.201 --> 01:26:33.950
guys,
they work with other guys and they fucking wind up hating each other.

1473
01:26:33.951 --> 01:26:37.220
Like Eddie if tad that with Jim Jefferies,

1474
01:26:37.221 --> 01:26:40.670
they had this great podcast together but they couldn't keep it together together

1475
01:26:40.671 --> 01:26:42.440
now.
And he's got his own things talking the shit.

1476
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:45.900
He's had three different ones like that Eddie's gone through.
Yeah.

1477
01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:48.440
What was that about?
They just didn't get along.
It's hard man.

1478
01:26:48.441 --> 01:26:52.400
Sometimes you want to talk and they're talking and sometimes you disagree and

1479
01:26:52.401 --> 01:26:55.220
you don't want to discuss certain things or the things that you think are

1480
01:26:55.221 --> 01:26:57.830
interesting they think or dom and never had you get mad.

1481
01:26:58.050 --> 01:26:59.060
Never had that with my boy over here.

1482
01:26:59.061 --> 01:27:01.070
Well that's one of the reasons why you guys work so well together.

1483
01:27:01.071 --> 01:27:05.720
You guys have an interesting dynamics and you know when you say ridiculous shit

1484
01:27:05.721 --> 01:27:09.020
that it's ridiculous and so you play along with it when everybody shits on you

1485
01:27:09.370 --> 01:27:13.670
cause you're kind of semi-serious when you first bring things up and then you're

1486
01:27:13.671 --> 01:27:14.570
not married to it.

1487
01:27:14.571 --> 01:27:17.630
You realize along the way when you've said why is it just hit him with a right

1488
01:27:17.631 --> 01:27:22.130
hand here for sure Brian,
he would think and then it becomes,

1489
01:27:22.131 --> 01:27:24.500
you kind of go with it.
No guys,
guys,
I box.

1490
01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:30.000
That's technically I was reading a study and it's a fact actually that's like,

1491
01:27:30.050 --> 01:27:33.410
why don't you Shaun Gladwell's the box?
And I was like,
it looked like,

1492
01:27:33.411 --> 01:27:36.290
I feel like I could navigate that kind of like that movement.

1493
01:27:36.291 --> 01:27:39.280
I wouldn't get lit up sometimes because I'm watching it and I'm like,
Oh God,

1494
01:27:39.790 --> 01:27:41.790
comedy Berkman is so relaxing.

1495
01:27:41.890 --> 01:27:46.150
Like that same personality he was talking about you like you go out and you say,

1496
01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:50.000
fuck,
I wish I was a big,
I wish throwing thing.

1497
01:27:51.950 --> 01:27:54.200
Meanwhile we're missing a good fight.
So really good fight.

1498
01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:57.380
Bergman's lighten them out.
He saw a lot of these guys,
man,

1499
01:27:57.381 --> 01:27:59.270
these guys know what is up.

1500
01:27:59.810 --> 01:28:03.480
I think I got coattail winning via Tko.
Well,
I

1501
01:28:05.010 --> 01:28:08.660
taste chunk Jitsu has really improved,
really improved.

1502
01:28:08.661 --> 01:28:11.900
I was really impressed with his takedowns and his Jujitsu in his last fight.

1503
01:28:12.450 --> 01:28:17.350
He was the longest was with Anderson with Anderson.
Well before that Louis,

1504
01:28:18.050 --> 01:28:20.840
well,
you exposed a fundamental flaw in Anderson's game to this.

1505
01:28:20.841 --> 01:28:25.060
If you don't lead,
he doesn't either.
True.
Oh,

1506
01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:30.260
no joke man.
He stood in Lombard's face,
man.
This guy choked.
I choked out.

1507
01:28:30.261 --> 01:28:32.960
John Fitch and one round put him to sleep.
That's right.

1508
01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:35.480
I forgot to call them in that guillotine.
Put him to sleep.

1509
01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:38.300
He's a fucking veteran.
He's been very good.

1510
01:28:38.301 --> 01:28:41.540
It was very good and world series of fighting and then he doesn't swear to

1511
01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:43.880
coming back.
He doesn't want to fight in the UFC.

1512
01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:47.390
Fought Lombard came in short notice and wasn't,

1513
01:28:47.391 --> 01:28:52.100
wasn't feeling well for that fight.
They fought stun gun and got to get choked.

1514
01:28:52.101 --> 01:28:54.010
Is that we lost by a burden as much.

1515
01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:55.760
Which kind of truck because he's lost four in a row.

1516
01:28:55.940 --> 01:29:00.350
I think it's how you what man.
I will always keep a guy like Berkman around.

1517
01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:04.320
He makes shit interesting.
Yup.
Swings to the fences.
He's very smart.

1518
01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:09.070
He's a good dude.
Oh Dude.
Fucking hurt

1519
01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:14.990
man.
I lost you lost the leftover from that left hand.

1520
01:29:14.991 --> 01:29:16.980
He tagged him with when he was,
oh dude.

1521
01:29:16.981 --> 01:29:21.840
He hits hard and you know what else about Bergman?
He's real calm in there.
Very.

1522
01:29:21.930 --> 01:29:25.410
He gets,
he gets real relaxed.
He doesn't spend his energy.

1523
01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:30.180
He also went through like some significant injuries with his back where he

1524
01:29:30.181 --> 01:29:31.560
healed it up in some weird way.

1525
01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:34.200
He was talking to me about it and I really didn't understand it and I wanted to

1526
01:29:34.201 --> 01:29:38.160
go more in depth to them but he said he did like balance work and like,

1527
01:29:38.510 --> 01:29:43.170
um,
it was like positive thinking.
What kind of injury are we talking about?

1528
01:29:43.330 --> 01:29:47.790
Barbell of bulging bulging from west side barbell.
He broke his back like five,

1529
01:29:47.791 --> 01:29:51.570
five different ways.
Louie Simmons and Shane Sweat.

1530
01:29:51.571 --> 01:29:54.090
He's one of his main instructors is saying that.

1531
01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:58.770
That's why he developed the reverse hyper machine specifically to heal his back

1532
01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:02.760
and he healed his back by himself.
Five breaks in his fucking spine.

1533
01:30:02.761 --> 01:30:06.360
They all wanted to cut them open.
They all want to fuse his discs.

1534
01:30:06.361 --> 01:30:09.040
That's a bad dude,
man.
He's a bad motherfucker.

1535
01:30:09.250 --> 01:30:13.140
You guys talk about transfer of power man in a huge way where it's like when you

1536
01:30:13.141 --> 01:30:16.500
see tip tap boxing and all that stuff and what is making guys turn it over?

1537
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.910
Like that stuff is trained.
Like you can change.
Like everybody's like,
oh,

1538
01:30:20.911 --> 01:30:24.030
he's got knockout power.
He does it.
It's like you can give that to somebody.

1539
01:30:24.031 --> 01:30:25.530
You can train yourself into that.

1540
01:30:25.531 --> 01:30:28.190
I've never seen anybody that has a pitty Pat Punch.
You become a bomber.

1541
01:30:28.450 --> 01:30:32.010
True the fence.
Look at Berkman or either you,
nobody trains it either,

1542
01:30:32.011 --> 01:30:33.570
but you like a George Foreman guy.

1543
01:30:33.571 --> 01:30:36.690
You don't have to train that shit [inaudible] with these guys,
Eugene Jackson,

1544
01:30:36.691 --> 01:30:40.020
but it doesn't mean that it's outside of the realm of others possibility.

1545
01:30:40.050 --> 01:30:41.460
If that is true.
I mean,

1546
01:30:41.461 --> 01:30:45.060
I think it has to do with your ability to cover distance in a very quick amount

1547
01:30:45.061 --> 01:30:47.190
of time,
but it also has to do with bone mass.

1548
01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.400
Bone mass is undeniable when it comes to punching.
It's not us.

1549
01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:54.300
It's not a weird secret that people with giant hands hit way fucking harder.

1550
01:30:54.510 --> 01:30:57.300
It just,
it just,
they just did little Datsun.

1551
01:30:57.820 --> 01:31:02.390
He's not a huge guy by any means.
Explosive and he puts guy's down.
He's so,

1552
01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:06.750
he's so fast.
Explosive.
When he turned he was born,

1553
01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:11.160
he turns his head.
No,
no,
no,
no.
He's,

1554
01:31:11.161 --> 01:31:12.730
he's got some speed.

1555
01:31:12.810 --> 01:31:16.740
Like every movement that he makes is 100% this is a good fucking fine.

1556
01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:19.410
I short elbows,
slept on Berkman.

1557
01:31:19.411 --> 01:31:22.770
I thought he was gonna get starched by Hector Lombard,
a juiced up.

1558
01:31:22.771 --> 01:31:26.370
Hector Lombard.
He freaking out,
man.
Yeah,

1559
01:31:26.371 --> 01:31:31.290
he's tough as fucking pop for juice.
Oh Jesus.

1560
01:31:31.291 --> 01:31:36.290
These guys going off and [inaudible] is fucking top God.

1561
01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:36.931
He's tough man.

1562
01:31:36.931 --> 01:31:41.280
He's one of the toughest guys as far as like his ability to take a shot and keep

1563
01:31:41.281 --> 01:31:43.950
his confidence.
He looks like he's in a different weight class.
10 Bergman.

1564
01:31:44.100 --> 01:31:44.911
Well he has,

1565
01:31:44.911 --> 01:31:49.911
he's a fight for the title and he was a tool five or to Tito.

1566
01:31:52.020 --> 01:31:54.690
Tito down.
Surprised him all the bad mother fucker.
Look at him.

1567
01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:57.150
He's got a lot better with his grappling.

1568
01:31:57.280 --> 01:32:00.160
His grappling has really improved in a big way.
Athlete.

1569
01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:06.300
<v 1>Hello?
It's fucking hurt.
Why?</v>

1570
01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:12.490
They ain't say that's pretty good.
I love Bergman.
He's still hurt,

1571
01:32:12.491 --> 01:32:13.900
man.
He's still hurt.
He doesn't have,

1572
01:32:13.901 --> 01:32:18.880
he doesn't know where he was when he threw that idea.
Wow Man.
Wow.

1573
01:32:19.690 --> 01:32:21.880
I'm over here trying to pretend I'm unphased by that.

1574
01:32:21.881 --> 01:32:25.660
I'm just going to walk in the right direction.
My coaches,

1575
01:32:26.170 --> 01:32:28.780
Jesus Christ,
that when he caught,

1576
01:32:28.781 --> 01:32:33.280
when he caught Patrick with that shot and you know guys hit pretty well when

1577
01:32:33.281 --> 01:32:33.671
he's like,

1578
01:32:33.671 --> 01:32:35.920
I'm going to just change direction and go right for a double leg right now.

1579
01:32:35.921 --> 01:32:36.840
Not even think about it like

1580
01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:42.160
that single leg is not finished all that often,

1581
01:32:42.161 --> 01:32:44.560
but someone who does it really well.
I think it's Shogun.

1582
01:32:44.690 --> 01:32:49.490
Like I see him finish that single leg a lot.
The best is DC.
If he gets a hold on.

1583
01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:53.560
Listen,
you're like,
you're going for a ride.
I don't,

1584
01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:56.900
I'm not a rest so I don't really know.
But he seems to do it.
Do it.

1585
01:32:56.901 --> 01:33:01.660
And you can ask snap,
straighten your leg out and snap you down.

1586
01:33:01.870 --> 01:33:04.770
But in my opinion,
the scariest is normal.
Go Madoff,
Nema.

1587
01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:07.570
Go read off that mother fucker out grapples.
Everybody true.

1588
01:33:07.630 --> 01:33:10.630
Like you seem him get a hold of people.
He just rag dolls everybody.

1589
01:33:10.750 --> 01:33:12.940
So way he's doing it.
That's so confusing.

1590
01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:17.650
Like dos Anjos is strong as fuck and he's a really good grab bar and when you

1591
01:33:17.651 --> 01:33:21.040
see him fight Namaka man off number got mad.
I was like,
Eh,
not today.

1592
01:33:22.090 --> 01:33:24.790
I think you'll be on bottom for a while.
Eat and elbow sandwiches.

1593
01:33:24.850 --> 01:33:29.000
He beat those Angeles Buddy.

1594
01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:31.200
He beat everybody that combat sock.

1595
01:33:31.330 --> 01:33:35.070
Oh right hand combat sambo world champions.

1596
01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:38.830
Nampa Boise also high level wrestler.
Oh,
he can wrestle for sure.

1597
01:33:40.010 --> 01:33:43.420
Background is primarily soundbite.
I don't know if he has experience as well.

1598
01:33:43.421 --> 01:33:47.500
A lot of Greco in that shit.
Is Greco.
Tony got a little better wrestling then.
Uh,

1599
01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:51.370
no.
Rafael dos Anjos.
Tony Ferguson.
Oh,

1600
01:33:51.371 --> 01:33:56.260
you're saying better wrestling then dos Anjos.
Yes.
Ooh,
that's tough.
Come on man.

1601
01:33:57.010 --> 01:34:01.960
Tony.
Tony has a real wrestler.
I agree.
Don't say Angeles is a world champion.

1602
01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:06.070
Grab Honi wrestled in high school and college and that American.
He's a jet.

1603
01:34:06.430 --> 01:34:08.530
Freestyle and mark.
Trust me,
he's,

1604
01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:12.130
I'm talking about UFC grappling,
wrestling,

1605
01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:18.310
Jiu Jitsu guy.
He's from Brazil.
There's three wrestlers in Brazil.
I know

1606
01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:21.430
they have a team.

1607
01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:30.950
Try Out.
How weird was it that hit not the bubble.

1608
01:34:30.951 --> 01:34:35.670
Lou was that MMA Brazilian MMA fighter.
That was a wrestling Daryl goal.

1609
01:34:35.671 --> 01:34:37.950
Gold was the only Brazilian.

1610
01:34:38.610 --> 01:34:42.460
He does have a lot of big races come out of Brazil.
Lou was a restaurant,

1611
01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:44.600
you know,
it does an amazing job with a single leg is a,

1612
01:34:44.601 --> 01:34:47.650
is a clever to Sherif the way he runs a pipe.

1613
01:34:49.530 --> 01:34:52.690
That's a great restaurant.
Another Brazilian basic pike run.

1614
01:34:52.730 --> 01:34:55.390
A lot of Brazil is getting arrested now,
don't get me wrong.

1615
01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:58.510
Can do couple of of capital when you're raised

1616
01:34:58.520 --> 01:34:58.980
<v 0>that way.</v>

1617
01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:01.280
When you go into junior high school and you're wrestling and then you're going

1618
01:35:01.281 --> 01:35:05.030
to high school.
He told me you're going to call it.
I mean those Brazilian guys,

1619
01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:09.230
I can't talk over each other.
I'm going to explode if it fell over.

1620
01:35:09.231 --> 01:35:11.660
Grabs your leg.
If you're single,
like he's the one guy that you're,

1621
01:35:11.661 --> 01:35:14.110
you're take down the fence.
It probably is going to work too.
Well,
you know it's,

1622
01:35:14.140 --> 01:35:16.700
you're doing basic stuff too.
It was really impressive.

1623
01:35:16.701 --> 01:35:20.990
There's a video of your boy Cyborg,
the other Cyborg.
Roberto Bruno Cyborg.

1624
01:35:20.991 --> 01:35:25.430
Go brew.
Yeah.
He's doing these drills.
God damnit.
Chi Moves.
Good Tornado.

1625
01:35:25.930 --> 01:35:28.340
He's doing drills like guard pastorals.
Jamie,

1626
01:35:28.341 --> 01:35:31.060
go to look at Cyborg Bjj on,

1627
01:35:31.410 --> 01:35:36.290
on Instagram and pull up the video swatch.
How he moves for 235 pound guy.

1628
01:35:36.460 --> 01:35:37.720
You're kind of out.
He gets,

1629
01:35:37.970 --> 01:35:41.540
he passes me on the belly and then he guy rolls into him and then he jumps to

1630
01:35:41.541 --> 01:35:43.090
the back.
Dude,
he,

1631
01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:47.930
you saw the video today with it today and I'm talking about a video from like a

1632
01:35:47.930 --> 01:35:51.800
week ago.
Oh,
well I'm sure he's got a bunch.
Did you post it Joe?
No,
he posted it.

1633
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:55.940
We'll get this watch at jetty.
Eddie jetty.
I'm sorry.
Eddie.
Watch this.
No,
no.

1634
01:35:55.941 --> 01:35:59.300
This is a different one,
Jamie.
This is him.
That's him.

1635
01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:03.410
That's just a escape that he does.
That one.
That one right hand corner.

1636
01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:07.400
This is wash the shit.
Watch this past.
Look how fast this motherfucker,

1637
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:14.480
he's a big guy,
man.
Look at this for a guy this big to move that.
Well.

1638
01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:19.460
I mean fuck freak.
What's its ear guards brother?

1639
01:36:19.461 --> 01:36:23.370
How dare you?
How dare beautiful.
I mean,

1640
01:36:23.390 --> 01:36:25.940
I'm so impressed with that.
I,
I mean,

1641
01:36:25.941 --> 01:36:29.450
I can't imagine that's a 240 pound man that can move like that.

1642
01:36:29.451 --> 01:36:31.490
That's fucking crazy.
That's how big he is,
right?

1643
01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:35.600
He's about two 42 40 man memoirs.
Think it was two 30.

1644
01:36:35.630 --> 01:36:39.560
He's a fucking panther.
I mean he really is a panther that is freakish.

1645
01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:45.080
He beat Boucher at uh,
the left freak man.

1646
01:36:45.620 --> 01:36:48.840
He is as good as it gets when it comes to Brazilian Jujitsu fight.

1647
01:36:48.850 --> 01:36:52.910
Look at this man guys.
As good as it gets.
Yes.
It's a monster.
So strong.

1648
01:36:53.150 --> 01:36:56.480
He's different from a lot of those guys in like his physical preparation too.

1649
01:36:56.750 --> 01:36:59.690
He puts all these videos up of the strength and conditioning shit that he does

1650
01:37:00.530 --> 01:37:02.360
like NFL combine shit.

1651
01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:05.800
Mother fucker was a run in with rubber bands pulling them and shit.

1652
01:37:05.810 --> 01:37:10.630
It's a true pro.
He's a true bro.
He's like this real pro.
Yes.
His super rash.

1653
01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:14.370
Yeah.
Really Nice Guy.
Great Guy.
Real positive online.

1654
01:37:14.380 --> 01:37:18.260
Really like inspirational online.
I'm a huge fan of his I me too.

1655
01:37:18.930 --> 01:37:21.590
Cause you will you will you a bombed out that people were mad at you about that

1656
01:37:21.591 --> 01:37:25.520
metamorris bout oh you're talking about the shop shut down the shop shut down

1657
01:37:25.521 --> 01:37:27.590
for where Brendan Shop.

1658
01:37:27.590 --> 01:37:30.920
Just shut down all of his take downs and just made them,
you know,

1659
01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:34.040
made them kind of stand up there and realize if this fight,

1660
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:35.570
if I don't want this fight to go to the ground,

1661
01:37:35.571 --> 01:37:36.800
you're not going to get me to the ground.

1662
01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:39.860
But then I went into his guard eight times.
Yeah he did after it was like,

1663
01:37:39.861 --> 01:37:43.100
you know what,
cool.
Check this out on your guide.
But the first thing you did,

1664
01:37:43.101 --> 01:37:46.280
and you did this within a couple of months of a UFC fight and everybody was mad

1665
01:37:46.281 --> 01:37:49.190
at you,
but I was like,
well listen,
you got to look at it this way.

1666
01:37:49.191 --> 01:37:50.900
The guy's a professional MMA fighter.

1667
01:37:51.030 --> 01:37:55.950
The the other guys fighting is known for Taryn needs to pieces like this is a re

1668
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:59.850
<v 1>all his Brockman will get that getting again,
it wasn't even that Joe,</v>

1669
01:37:59.851 --> 01:38:04.740
it was more like,
uh,
well not even that loud when he signed up,

1670
01:38:04.741 --> 01:38:08.940
if it wasn't for that,
what the plan was to wear mouth.
I want to keep shooting,

1671
01:38:09.150 --> 01:38:12.690
keep shooting.
So I get a hold of his neck.
It's all my stuff is in transitions.

1672
01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:17.580
He knew this,
so he stopped shooting and then he just sat to is.
But I was like,

1673
01:38:17.581 --> 01:38:20.310
well we gotta get something going here.
So that's why I kept going to his guard.

1674
01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:24.580
No transition plan was to try to catch him as he was sharing.
Yes.

1675
01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:27.690
And then when he decides to it does bad,
I was like,
I didn't think of them like,

1676
01:38:27.691 --> 01:38:32.160
well fuck.
And then you get that kind of weird,
like she's not engaging.
I didn't,

1677
01:38:32.190 --> 01:38:33.870
you know,
even when you were actually grappling,

1678
01:38:33.871 --> 01:38:35.520
he never was able to put you in a weird position.

1679
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:38.820
You should really do some out of Morris type shit,
dude,
I would love to,
man.

1680
01:38:38.821 --> 01:38:42.690
I don't know what Holocaust Bravo invitational.

1681
01:38:43.190 --> 01:38:47.640
Super fight in the heavyweight division.
Eddie,
who you got for him?

1682
01:38:47.641 --> 01:38:50.700
What's up Eddie in Austin,
Texas.
We might

1683
01:38:52.730 --> 01:38:55.680
want to do Cyborg.
I get someone else.

1684
01:38:57.750 --> 01:39:00.530
I want to see park to pass it.

1685
01:39:00.540 --> 01:39:05.100
I need somebody now that I know what she was trying to do to me is catch me when

1686
01:39:05.101 --> 01:39:07.650
you're not going to get for the turnover time.
Ebi overtime,

1687
01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:08.880
you ain't gonna be able to do that.

1688
01:39:08.881 --> 01:39:12.810
So I'm not worried about that because there's only one guy in the world who I do

1689
01:39:12.811 --> 01:39:16.800
that too.
And that Cyborg.
Hey,
you know what?
This is this.

1690
01:39:17.190 --> 01:39:22.190
When the rule set says that if there's no submission at the end of 15 minutes or

1691
01:39:22.741 --> 01:39:23.430
20 minutes,

1692
01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:28.340
it's a draw as an I would do the exact same thing if I'm going with the guy that

1693
01:39:28.350 --> 01:39:30.060
was fucking crazy dangerous.

1694
01:39:30.330 --> 01:39:33.510
I'd rather take the Goddamn draw then get choked out or,
or,

1695
01:39:33.511 --> 01:39:36.020
or I would do the same goddamn thing.
Well,
no,
that wasn't my plan at all.

1696
01:39:36.030 --> 01:39:40.290
Let's just go to a draw.
My,
my,
my plan was a choke his ass out in a dark store.

1697
01:39:40.291 --> 01:39:43.260
Get team.
That was the plan to get him shooting,

1698
01:39:43.261 --> 01:39:47.950
to open up and transition to the view submitted.
Signboard but that would be,

1699
01:39:48.980 --> 01:39:52.280
yeah,
I do.
That's why I signed up for it.
Holy Shit.
Like,
you know,

1700
01:39:52.450 --> 01:39:56.120
I would be super fucking cautious.
Cautious hundred percent.

1701
01:39:56.430 --> 01:39:59.830
I would be kind of this motherfucker.
This is a sidebar too.

1702
01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:04.770
God Damn bad motherfucker.
Oh look at this.

1703
01:40:04.771 --> 01:40:09.080
And he came out and hurting coattail Bergman.
Oh my God.

1704
01:40:09.081 --> 01:40:10.560
And he returns returns.

1705
01:40:12.890 --> 01:40:17.700
Oh my God.
Wow.
We tagged him again.

1706
01:40:17.701 --> 01:40:21.000
He's wobbled.
Damn.
Berkman is so accurate.

1707
01:40:22.170 --> 01:40:26.910
Great fighter man.
He's so calm and the pocket.

1708
01:40:26.970 --> 01:40:29.940
It's the football super.
Yeah.
He doesn't get emotional.
It does.

1709
01:40:29.941 --> 01:40:33.690
He know he stays away calm.
Especially coming after him.
Oh,

1710
01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:36.990
he sees everything that way.
You know he's a,
he's a real veteran,

1711
01:40:37.110 --> 01:40:39.710
but soul's Code Tay man,
he really is Sicko.

1712
01:40:39.740 --> 01:40:42.630
Taize is commonly get under fire.
Go taste well,

1713
01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:46.290
the hardest hitters at 70 Jesus Christ is he though,

1714
01:40:46.770 --> 01:40:50.850
don't you think that like the cut down to one 70 has maybe diminished a bit of

1715
01:40:50.851 --> 01:40:54.010
that?
Cause it's hard.
He's not the same.
He's lost physical

1716
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:57.940
<v 0>side,
but he's still a big seven.
Yes.
Yes.
He is big for sure,</v>

1717
01:40:58.060 --> 01:41:00.400
but we haven't really been seen them knock guys out.

1718
01:41:00.590 --> 01:41:05.000
<v 4>Did,
oh,
sorry.</v>

1719
01:41:05.001 --> 01:41:08.630
I missed that last part.
What we say?
Oh my God.

1720
01:41:08.900 --> 01:41:12.450
How tough is Bergman?
How tough he is.
He's almost back.

1721
01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:17.930
Don't stop.
That.
Could that not have been,

1722
01:41:18.750 --> 01:41:22.360
that has never been a better timing ever.
You're like,

1723
01:41:22.370 --> 01:41:23.570
he's not really knocking guys out.

1724
01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:28.780
<v 0>We're at one 70 they said to me,
Joe Rogan a Gary.</v>

1725
01:41:30.660 --> 01:41:34.350
It's
great cut.

1726
01:41:35.340 --> 01:41:39.010
That's the third round.
And he's not tired at all.
That was fucking amazing.

1727
01:41:39.070 --> 01:41:40.710
I hope to fight.
What a fight.

1728
01:41:40.711 --> 01:41:44.580
And you gotta think how rocks he got early in that round?
Yes.

1729
01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:47.550
Well he was covering up and Berkman was going off on him.

1730
01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:52.530
That mother fucker is tough a shit.
Oof.
That was dope.

1731
01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:55.650
God Damn,
that right hand was picture perfect too.

1732
01:41:56.340 --> 01:42:00.930
It's a huge fight in front of all his fans to in Canada.
God Damn in a war.

1733
01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:04.830
That's like the sweetest victory because it's the one where you know,

1734
01:42:04.831 --> 01:42:08.450
you pull yourself out of the fire.
Fuck.

1735
01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:11.580
Like you see the benefits from your training.
You can't.
He was,

1736
01:42:12.690 --> 01:42:17.010
oh my goodness.
But that right hand was so beautiful.
Look,

1737
01:42:17.020 --> 01:42:20.130
I sets it up to faints with the jab first.

1738
01:42:21.510 --> 01:42:26.460
Hold Guy Josh Perkins.
Thomas.
Fuck.
Tough as fuck.
Berkman almost got up.

1739
01:42:26.490 --> 01:42:28.800
Yes.
You know what?
And I'll tell you what,
if they didn't stop the fight,

1740
01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:32.700
Berkman would have eventually gotten up.
Look,
watch what he does here.
He goes,

1741
01:42:32.701 --> 01:42:35.550
I don't want to come up.
I'm going to pull guard.
He rolls to his back here.

1742
01:42:35.790 --> 01:42:39.890
He's not like he's right there.
Yeah,
right.
Yeah.

1743
01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:42.150
They probably shouldn't have stopped it,
but either way.

1744
01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:46.970
Whatever that either though.
Powerful Patrick Otay.

1745
01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:51.770
Well he knows,
I mean he knows he got a bomb dropped on his chin.
I'm,

1746
01:42:51.850 --> 01:42:52.170
I'll tell you,

1747
01:42:52.170 --> 01:42:57.170
set it up to the pawing with the jab to get that distance then balloon fight of

1748
01:42:57.571 --> 01:42:59.060
the night so far.
Oh yeah.

1749
01:42:59.260 --> 01:43:03.660
I commentated a fight where the ref stopped it early and the guy was complaining

1750
01:43:03.661 --> 01:43:07.440
that he had stopped it early.
So the Rep said,
and this was all in the room,
said,

1751
01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:10.080
okay,
fight against the guy got knocked out again.

1752
01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:15.530
I don't want to throw the fire under the bus.
He's a really nice,

1753
01:43:15.531 --> 01:43:20.370
what organization?
King of kitsch too hot to handle.
And he was complaining,

1754
01:43:20.371 --> 01:43:23.640
why did you stop?
But I wasn't rock.
He goes,
you were out.
I wasn't rocking.

1755
01:43:23.641 --> 01:43:26.550
The Rep said,
all right,
let's go again.

1756
01:43:26.580 --> 01:43:29.520
And then he backed up in the corner and said,
you could see it in his eyes.

1757
01:43:29.521 --> 01:43:33.450
He's like,
fuck.
He never thought the ref would continue.

1758
01:43:33.451 --> 01:43:36.270
The fight isn't that happened in the EOC before where they're like,
no,
no,

1759
01:43:36.390 --> 01:43:40.500
watch the replay.
You're unconscious.
Well,
not,

1760
01:43:40.501 --> 01:43:44.190
but the premier little Bustamonte had a tap.
Matt Lindland out twice.

1761
01:43:45.790 --> 01:43:47.730
Remember that?
Yeah.
Why?
What do you mean big?

1762
01:43:47.731 --> 01:43:51.740
John McCarthy fucked up Madelyn and he caught Matt Lindland Armbar Lindland

1763
01:43:51.741 --> 01:43:53.990
tapped and then he'd said he didn't tap.

1764
01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.760
So was just trying to change his position.

1765
01:43:56.180 --> 01:44:00.170
And so the main of fight again and then the next round Marillo I think caught

1766
01:44:00.171 --> 01:44:02.330
him in a guillotine.
Pretty sure he's gay teens,

1767
01:44:02.570 --> 01:44:06.530
but he had tapped them twice because a of uh,
you know,

1768
01:44:06.531 --> 01:44:09.850
it's an error by the rep,
Pedro.
I'm just trying to change the position.
Yeah.

1769
01:44:10.430 --> 01:44:14.720
Well I think,
I think John saw the arms fully straightened out.
Saw he's fighting.

1770
01:44:14.721 --> 01:44:18.020
Bustamante saw you didn't,
you didn't get no,
that's legit.

1771
01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:22.100
That's crossing Gracie's original squad of black belts.

1772
01:44:22.101 --> 01:44:26.330
Tall man to man is good.
And I'm Matt Lindland.
You know,

1773
01:44:26.331 --> 01:44:28.220
he's a fucking competitor.
You could say that about him.

1774
01:44:28.221 --> 01:44:31.730
He bit somebody while I was wrestling with him.
Yeah.
He was like,
uh,

1775
01:44:31.750 --> 01:44:33.110
one of his amateur wrestling matches.

1776
01:44:33.111 --> 01:44:38.111
He bits some dude who does call that tobacco in his like upper lip type tobacco

1777
01:44:38.770 --> 01:44:41.900
dude.
Straight Hillbilly Shit.

1778
01:44:41.930 --> 01:44:44.540
He was one of the toughest guys alive for a little while.

1779
01:44:44.990 --> 01:44:48.050
All that whole squad up there.
Yeah.
He was one of the toughest women,

1780
01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:51.950
85 pounders in the world.
Randy was up there like,
well,

1781
01:44:51.951 --> 01:44:55.580
that's when he fought David Tarell,
when David's role was a real threat dude,

1782
01:44:55.581 --> 01:45:00.040
he was knocked him out.
Dave trail was terrifying.
I remember him,
man.
Crap,

1783
01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:05.000
bleeding.
Grapplers quest.
He was,
uh,
he was just ripping heads off.

1784
01:45:05.060 --> 01:45:08.810
Yeah,
I heard it in the gym.
He's like the biggest freak.
He's a monster.
I heard.

1785
01:45:08.811 --> 01:45:12.320
He's an absolute nightmare to grapple with.
Well,
you should see him fucking new.

1786
01:45:12.321 --> 01:45:16.190
Go back and watch his early Abu Dhabi's to Dave Turo was a monster.

1787
01:45:16.191 --> 01:45:18.650
I'm familiar with him.
He's a super monster.
I'm a huge fan.
You know,

1788
01:45:18.651 --> 01:45:23.090
he had some see serious fucking infections in his ear from cauliflower where

1789
01:45:23.091 --> 01:45:24.560
they had to remove his ear.

1790
01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:28.370
They cut his ear off his head and had a scrape it out and there's all pos and

1791
01:45:28.371 --> 01:45:29.520
everything in there.
And they,

1792
01:45:29.521 --> 01:45:32.180
I think they had a windup cauterizing inside his ear.

1793
01:45:32.420 --> 01:45:36.080
He had some serious fucking ear problems.
No idea about that dude.

1794
01:45:36.410 --> 01:45:40.070
I'll cauliflower ear,
you know,
most of it he like look at Cortese right there.

1795
01:45:40.220 --> 01:45:41.720
Most of it is just cosmetic,

1796
01:45:41.930 --> 01:45:46.460
but there are times where you get ear problems where it goes deep inside the

1797
01:45:46.460 --> 01:45:49.970
year and you're in a big fucking terror.
We were seen as guys when they,

1798
01:45:50.030 --> 01:45:52.190
when like on the outside it's not a big deal,

1799
01:45:52.191 --> 01:45:55.610
but when that starts to close off and then they're,
they're hearing is mitigated.

1800
01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:58.750
Oh yeah.
And they get staff.
You get staff inside the rear too.

1801
01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:02.930
It's nothing that can happen.
Ah,
yeah.
It's fucking,
it's terrifying.

1802
01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:07.820
Oh my God.
What a perfect,
perfect timing.
Crazy that and put them out.

1803
01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:10.040
Oh my God.
Yeah.

1804
01:46:10.130 --> 01:46:14.330
Right on the button co Tay [inaudible] still getting better.
It's amazing.

1805
01:46:14.420 --> 01:46:17.900
It's awesome to see him just,
he never loses his enthusiasm for the four.

1806
01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:19.850
It'd be cool veins as a button,

1807
01:46:19.851 --> 01:46:22.550
like a mute button where he gets say some shit that you wouldn't want to say on

1808
01:46:22.551 --> 01:46:26.300
air,
but he just want to tell everyone else.
Like what?
No,

1809
01:46:26.301 --> 01:46:29.040
I'm just saying something right now.

1810
01:46:31.250 --> 01:46:33.760
Right now with,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Like just throughout the,

1811
01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:37.360
throughout the general would be nice to have like a meal Voucher Code Tam.
Sure.

1812
01:46:37.361 --> 01:46:40.210
It's kind of sensitive.
It's thinking.
Maybe you're talking shit.
Hey,

1813
01:46:40.220 --> 01:46:43.540
I love Patrick Hotel.
Are you kidding Josh Burke men loved my daughter.

1814
01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:45.410
I'm just talking about general.

1815
01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:49.260
See that's a fight where I agree that you shouldn't almost shouldn't cut
Bergman,

1816
01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:51.420
so fucking the animal is an animal.

1817
01:46:51.421 --> 01:46:54.360
Why caught them is entertaining and by the way,

1818
01:46:54.361 --> 01:46:58.680
he beats a lot of guys in that division.
Tatagata guys give them the right match,

1819
01:46:59.130 --> 01:47:02.940
but there comes a point where you've beat so many good guys.

1820
01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.370
They're not going to give you those easy match ups.
You know what I'm saying?

1821
01:47:05.380 --> 01:47:08.480
Like you've beat,
you're such a veteran like this guy.
How about that match up?

1822
01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:14.850
Is there anybody more explosive than that guy?
Wasn't straight Outta Compton.
No,

1823
01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:16.630
I heard it was in it though.
Yeah.
Did you see him?

1824
01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:19.920
There's a video with him and this a bodybuilder guy and they're doing all these

1825
01:47:19.921 --> 01:47:23.130
bodybuilder exercises and say he might have the best body and they sent it to my

1826
01:47:23.131 --> 01:47:25.170
friend.
Who does he have the best body.

1827
01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:28.530
I sent it to my friends who's a strength and conditioning coach and he was

1828
01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:31.710
horrified.
He was like,
why the fuck would you ever do this kind of a workout,

1829
01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:35.280
like a super set workout for MMA.
It's like this is it.
This is really,

1830
01:47:35.281 --> 01:47:38.130
you were literally going to make your body work against itself.

1831
01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:42.480
You're going to stretch your muscles out below your muscles,
out in weird ways.

1832
01:47:42.510 --> 01:47:43.470
Stress out all you know,

1833
01:47:43.471 --> 01:47:46.200
like you're going to do bodybuilding stuff like bench presses.

1834
01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:50.310
It was really an interesting conversation and no one knows because what's good

1835
01:47:50.311 --> 01:47:51.900
for you is not good for him.

1836
01:47:52.020 --> 01:47:55.290
Everybody's got their own different way of improving their body.

1837
01:47:55.291 --> 01:47:59.340
But for Woodley he feels that he was not as exposed.
Like he listened to me,

1838
01:47:59.341 --> 01:48:02.890
people like me that were saying he's carrying around too much muscle and that it

1839
01:48:02.910 --> 01:48:05.310
was taken away from his explosion.
You know,

1840
01:48:05.311 --> 01:48:08.210
cause he was trying to like lean out a little bit.
So then he went back to it,

1841
01:48:08.410 --> 01:48:12.240
see how it is,
right?
That's Woodley's body type,
right?
It's super explosive.

1842
01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:13.860
He might not have the best cardio,

1843
01:48:13.861 --> 01:48:17.400
but he's going to be a mother fucking beast to hanging out with for those first

1844
01:48:17.401 --> 01:48:18.840
two rounds.
Yeah,
the footage of him.

1845
01:48:19.050 --> 01:48:22.710
He's never going to be a Neil magni but he just has to do what he does best.

1846
01:48:22.711 --> 01:48:24.850
You know like Shane Carwyn he tried that too.

1847
01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:27.000
She aint tried losing all this weight and shit.

1848
01:48:27.001 --> 01:48:30.780
Try being a cardio guy and he just wasn't the same fight or man,
yeah,
you a,

1849
01:48:30.781 --> 01:48:33.750
you don't have what brought you to the dance,
right?
Yeah,
exactly.

1850
01:48:34.050 --> 01:48:37.410
Stick what got you to the dance he had seen.
Even if Shit is interesting,

1851
01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:40.010
it's an interesting problem because if you fight and a guy like,

1852
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:43.770
like Johnny Hendricks,
who's his next opponent,
great fight by the way.
Right.

1853
01:48:43.771 --> 01:48:47.160
But that's a great fight with,
if the fight goes into the third round,

1854
01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:50.310
can he compete at the same level?
Robbie Lawler,

1855
01:48:50.430 --> 01:48:54.560
you know Robbie Lawler can go balls to the wall for five rounds.
He can do it.

1856
01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:55.620
He can do it.

1857
01:48:55.620 --> 01:48:59.520
So if you try that shit in the first round on him and you're still there for the

1858
01:48:59.521 --> 01:49:02.600
second and third rounds,
you're going to be,
you know,

1859
01:49:02.601 --> 01:49:04.740
you're a different person now.
You're not the same guy.

1860
01:49:04.741 --> 01:49:08.880
You're a guy operating at 40% that's what you gotta do though with all these

1861
01:49:08.881 --> 01:49:11.930
maybe.
Right.
That's his best shot to win,
right?

1862
01:49:11.940 --> 01:49:14.040
First two rounds to be at your shit,
man.

1863
01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:18.220
Fucking demolition machine until you can't be a demo and they get taken out and

1864
01:49:18.270 --> 01:49:21.660
straight up veteran who can,
whether your store,
I'm like Glover with the Osm.

1865
01:49:22.300 --> 01:49:23.480
Oh speed.

1866
01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:29.690
I think you're doing great Ryan.
Thank you.
Tape.

1867
01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:33.090
When you talk to these strength coaches,
is there,
are there like three,

1868
01:49:33.091 --> 01:49:36.960
four exercises?
All of them agree are very important.
A lot of bodies,

1869
01:49:37.980 --> 01:49:39.870
you say that,
but Sergei Cola love,

1870
01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:43.470
he believes in [inaudible] the fucking one of the best boxers on the planet.

1871
01:49:43.670 --> 01:49:46.980
Yeah.
Kovalev does.
Yeah,
it does pull out easy power.
Yeah.

1872
01:49:47.110 --> 01:49:48.040
He does a lot of politics

1873
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:51.420
<v 1>because he wants to stay flexible and I'm a big range of motion.
Yeah.
He's,</v>

1874
01:49:51.490 --> 01:49:53.110
he's into politeness and kind of interesting.

1875
01:49:53.111 --> 01:49:55.180
I thought because I've seen a lot of guys that are in a yoga,

1876
01:49:55.181 --> 01:49:58.230
I've never seen anybody that's into Palladio's,
right?
Rhonda did plot.

1877
01:49:58.231 --> 01:50:01.660
He's like yoga.
It's just a strengthening.

1878
01:50:01.710 --> 01:50:04.610
So Brian's nothing like yoga.
Let me know what you're talking about.

1879
01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:08.530
Yo actually lie down.
You have cables and equipment.
Yogas your own weight

1880
01:50:10.100 --> 01:50:10.933
line down.

1881
01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:15.190
If you've ever done to like that because it's a lot of these lot of housewives.

1882
01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:19.110
I'm going to ask that question.
I had court of law right now.
Pull out the height.

1883
01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:22.600
Does I pass it?
I've never even once thought about going in.

1884
01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:24.070
I've seen it being done.

1885
01:50:24.100 --> 01:50:27.840
Those chicks look like they're putting out almost no effort.
They say time.

1886
01:50:27.850 --> 01:50:31.600
I look in there,
I'm like,
this looks like maybe the easiest workout you can do.

1887
01:50:31.870 --> 01:50:34.240
Everybody comes out,
their body looks exactly the same.

1888
01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:38.740
Tell me he was a real athlete.
Told me it was no joke.
I can't.
I'm sure it's,

1889
01:50:38.741 --> 01:50:42.640
I'm fucking,
I'm fucking around.
I'm sure it's hard.
Here we go.
What's up

1890
01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:48.700
now?
You don't have to listen.
You don't have to.

1891
01:50:50.210 --> 01:50:54.790
We are going to bet on the main event.
Why aren't we,
oh,
if I lose this one,

1892
01:50:56.200 --> 01:50:59.100
you're willing to take Charles all know

1893
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:02.480
which one we Breton out.
Brian.
I don't know.

1894
01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:05.860
They just showed he didn't look that yoked.

1895
01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:08.970
They just showed him standing there hearing highlights there.

1896
01:51:08.980 --> 01:51:11.650
There've been times where he's unbelievable yoke.

1897
01:51:14.140 --> 01:51:19.140
We just watched it as a wrong Eddie are you and Collin bed on the main event.

1898
01:51:19.750 --> 01:51:22.300
Okay,
Holloway.
I bet.

1899
01:51:22.301 --> 01:51:25.000
Oliveira you got Max Holloway Holloway all day for dinner.

1900
01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:27.040
Do you really listen Halloween?

1901
01:51:27.140 --> 01:51:28.720
Certainly when I don't want anybody to think that.

1902
01:51:28.721 --> 01:51:31.210
I think he's going to lose a fight.
I don't know what the fuck's going to happen.

1903
01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:35.230
I'm getting lost in silver as eyes.
I think I like the dreamy.
He's handsome.

1904
01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:39.130
He's a handsome.
It was the top three most handsome UFC fighters.
Brian.
Oh,

1905
01:51:39.131 --> 01:51:43.660
when Luke Rockhold without question rock called.
Let's go.
Well,
Eric Silva,

1906
01:51:43.661 --> 01:51:44.494
let's go.

1907
01:51:44.740 --> 01:51:47.920
I would have did this very good question and one of my favorite kinds of

1908
01:51:47.921 --> 01:51:52.570
questions
I have to say,

1909
01:51:53.050 --> 01:51:55.680
you see,
you got character,
you gotta throw character in the mixed.

1910
01:51:55.681 --> 01:52:00.400
Conor McGregor is women go nuts for Connor.
He's got style.

1911
01:52:00.430 --> 01:52:03.550
Cain Velasquez is not an ugly man.
Perfect proportions.

1912
01:52:06.190 --> 01:52:08.050
If he was shredded,
Sir Cane,

1913
01:52:08.580 --> 01:52:12.090
I had Luke Rocheleau have to ask you to step out of this conversation.

1914
01:52:14.660 --> 01:52:17.860
If you're in [inaudible],

1915
01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:23.120
has [inaudible] have to ask you to take a step for Dumas.

1916
01:52:23.410 --> 01:52:26.660
Reyna.
Interesting facial.
Just take the bench for a second and

1917
01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:31.510
ask you to stand down.
Sir.
I appreciate your enthusiasm,

1918
01:52:31.511 --> 01:52:33.790
but right now you're disrupting the chemistry.
Your top five count.

1919
01:52:33.850 --> 01:52:37.250
I got to go with my boy shop.
You've got to put shop and top five.
Oh,

1920
01:52:37.251 --> 01:52:41.950
you're tired.
It's late.
Not officially retired.

1921
01:52:43.030 --> 01:52:46.190
What do you base that on his high shop eyes when he walks

1922
01:52:46.190 --> 01:52:50.430
<v 4>in
the crates.
A Humphrey.</v>

1923
01:52:50.431 --> 01:52:54.260
I epidemic.
Man,
it's nuts.

1924
01:52:55.380 --> 01:52:58.880
You gotta.
You gotta go shop.
He's just a,
he's bigger.
He's bright.
He's very,
very,

1925
01:52:58.881 --> 01:53:02.640
he's Veit out and a,
and he walks up to Pete.
Pete.

1926
01:53:02.790 --> 01:53:07.790
It always holding his breath when he walks and you got to get out.

1927
01:53:10.050 --> 01:53:13.900
Eric Silva,
Eric Silva's gotta be put in there.
Yes.

1928
01:53:15.880 --> 01:53:20.010
No scalp
at the top.

1929
01:53:20.210 --> 01:53:24.030
I love to tell me.
I just can't give them top 10 oh man.

1930
01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:29.180
But I'm speaking aesthetically as a connoisseur of the male physique and face to

1931
01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:31.070
face without the face just body weight.

1932
01:53:31.080 --> 01:53:32.990
We all agree that Luke Rockhold is number one.

1933
01:53:34.900 --> 01:53:37.360
We all agree the only reason why anybody gets latest,

1934
01:53:37.370 --> 01:53:39.570
because Luke Rockhold didn't get that first.
Thank God

1935
01:53:41.420 --> 01:53:45.920
he should sell tee shirts with that on it.
We got to go.
Who's number two?
I mean,

1936
01:53:45.921 --> 01:53:48.030
this is a big question.
Well,

1937
01:53:48.390 --> 01:53:51.320
there's people that like a Chris Weidman and all American looking fella.

1938
01:53:51.321 --> 01:53:54.350
He's a cutie pie.
He's not top five.
Give them tough fight.

1939
01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:00.550
Robbie Lawler is overlooked.
Robbie Lawler's escape.
It's okay.

1940
01:54:01.010 --> 01:54:05.990
Daddy Henry,
how about this one?
Dark Horse,
Carlos Condit.
Yes.

1941
01:54:08.320 --> 01:54:10.850
By the way.
Too Skinny and he said,
excuse me,

1942
01:54:12.970 --> 01:54:16.970
I'm getting a number.
Tells him as far my book.
Yes.
I have to say,

1943
01:54:17.300 --> 01:54:19.930
I'm going to say Tyrone Woodley.
I got one Allen Joe Ban.

1944
01:54:20.200 --> 01:54:22.310
Oh,

1945
01:54:26.290 --> 01:54:29.690
that's not even fair to

1946
01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:34.850
might be number one.
He's number zero.

1947
01:54:34.910 --> 01:54:37.700
The only thing that separates him from Rockhold is rock holds taller.

1948
01:54:37.790 --> 01:54:41.250
We got to ignore him.
He's a professional.

1949
01:54:42.230 --> 01:54:43.970
He doesn't count.
He gets paid for that.

1950
01:54:44.270 --> 01:54:48.320
We're talking about regular guy that look at that face.
Goddamn beautiful man.

1951
01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:55.390
Jesus Christ.
It's a hell of a fight.
Perfect man.
Ryan.

1952
01:54:55.490 --> 01:54:59.030
I was staying next to a Marriott Hotel and he's just working out in the hallway

1953
01:54:59.031 --> 01:55:02.030
and I'm walking through it with my girlfriend job ahead and he's like working

1954
01:55:02.031 --> 01:55:04.790
out in the hallway with a trainer,

1955
01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:09.810
printing like the hotel hallway.
Just kind of getting somebody opens the donor,

1956
01:55:10.700 --> 01:55:15.020
I dunno.
Shirt off.
You had to bring him up.

1957
01:55:15.290 --> 01:55:19.750
He says Christ,
real conversation professional.

1958
01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:24.500
He makes Eric Silver look like some dude from the hobbit.
He does.

1959
01:55:25.050 --> 01:55:26.330
It looks like Lord of the Rings.

1960
01:55:26.331 --> 01:55:31.331
Now do Ben is is Dubin still fighting and he's talking about shallow fight or

1961
01:55:33.621 --> 01:55:37.790
podcast.
You got to do a little research son.
I am.
I'm just,

1962
01:55:37.791 --> 01:55:42.200
I'm just thinking just karate.
When I was 12 I've researched,

1963
01:55:42.930 --> 01:55:44.130
just wanted San Diego.

1964
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:48.510
<v 1>His body guys.
Yeah.
His body.
No,
even in my top five anymore.</v>

1965
01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:53.790
His body kiss my ass.
He looks like a natural athlete.

1966
01:55:53.850 --> 01:55:56.880
Yeah,
he does,
but there you go.
You can keep that poor facial hair.

1967
01:55:56.910 --> 01:56:00.380
He's good looking guy.
He's not making my top five comment.
I got conduit.

1968
01:56:00.470 --> 01:56:05.280
We got the Bronco carnage.
You,
Bam,
Bam,
Bam.
Allen's number one.

1969
01:56:05.410 --> 01:56:09.570
[inaudible] number one.
Really?
Yeah.

1970
01:56:09.590 --> 01:56:12.510
Alex count.
You can't count.
Count Him.

1971
01:56:13.870 --> 01:56:16.830
He's a prefab 11 five 11 is not the,
it's no,

1972
01:56:16.831 --> 01:56:20.280
I can't give it over stuff there for the six foot three Luke.
I can't do it,

1973
01:56:20.281 --> 01:56:23.880
my friend.
Yeah,
but that's the only thing that Luke has overall.
Be facially,

1974
01:56:23.881 --> 01:56:27.030
he's like a 10.
I like my mentor,
but I like my mentor.

1975
01:56:27.060 --> 01:56:31.050
I like them to tell her pants off my head.
I got to go with,

1976
01:56:31.051 --> 01:56:33.480
I got to go with my man.
Well,
if you want to count that,

1977
01:56:33.481 --> 01:56:38.310
then you know who's the hottest announcer?
Even Levine.
Joe Rogan.
No,
no,
no.

1978
01:56:38.311 --> 01:56:41.430
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
The ring announcer.
Oh,
Bruce buffer.

1979
01:56:41.910 --> 01:56:44.640
He's the hottest thing for sure.
Is the hottest man pay slick.
Well,

1980
01:56:44.660 --> 01:56:49.240
it looks like a fucking James Bond character.
Mergel Yada.
Come against.

1981
01:56:49.740 --> 01:56:53.170
Wow.
Eric is smooth as fuck.
He does not look,
oh,
this is the shit.
Right.

1982
01:56:53.580 --> 01:56:57.120
This is interesting.
You know,
he's lost a lot of muscle mass to you.
Kidding me.

1983
01:56:58.150 --> 01:56:59.910
A young Wilmer Valderrama.
Now,

1984
01:56:59.911 --> 01:57:04.140
do you think that he's lost muscle mass because he's trying to be leaner so he

1985
01:57:04.141 --> 01:57:07.440
has more cardio because that has been his issue.
Yeah,
that could be it too.

1986
01:57:07.441 --> 01:57:10.550
Or do you think this is a ped issue?
Should be bold.

1987
01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:14.390
The shop you specifically for the press?
Yeah,
for TMZ.

1988
01:57:15.810 --> 01:57:17.370
That's tough,
man.
It could be both.

1989
01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:20.100
I mean it could be right because it could be a combo,

1990
01:57:20.101 --> 01:57:23.220
but you have to consider it and we'll hear machine into the aggression like

1991
01:57:23.221 --> 01:57:26.220
Aubrey was talking about.
He's just not,
not as ferocious right now.

1992
01:57:26.230 --> 01:57:28.980
It's not some fucking big bombs right now.

1993
01:57:28.981 --> 01:57:30.930
I don't know what you guys are talking about.
No,
he was,

1994
01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:34.560
he just took a big deep breath.
He was,
he used to be super aggressive.
Dude.

1995
01:57:34.561 --> 01:57:37.830
You see the fire
spinning elbow.

1996
01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:41.670
He has to be careful too because Neil's number one things cardio if you're

1997
01:57:41.671 --> 01:57:43.050
hearing Sylville.
Exactly.

1998
01:57:43.410 --> 01:57:45.960
The worst thing is your cardio and Neil has a good ground game man.

1999
01:57:45.961 --> 01:57:48.750
He's fucking real good on the ground.
Super solid on the ground.

2000
01:57:49.890 --> 01:57:52.740
I'd say purple belt.
Yeah.
Solid Damn.

2001
01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:57.030
To say that after a Damien Maia fight,
yes,

2002
01:57:57.390 --> 01:58:01.830
but other than that,
he's looked awesome on the ground.
He's got a good ground,

2003
01:58:02.190 --> 01:58:04.980
but look a little too high,
but you know there was a wild scramble there.

2004
01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:10.320
Oh,
it takes him down.
Plot Fair.
C'Mon.

2005
01:58:10.350 --> 01:58:13.640
C'Mon,
c'mon,
c'mon.
Well,
for a guy like Aaron,
he's,

2006
01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:16.110
you know when you fight a guy like Matt Brown and Matt Brown,

2007
01:58:16.111 --> 01:58:20.390
just out work some down.
Beautiful Sign.

2008
01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:23.910
That's a sign of some dark shit on the ground for magnate right there.

2009
01:58:23.911 --> 01:58:28.350
That quick,
that fast.
There's a big difference of groundwork right here.

2010
01:58:29.270 --> 01:58:32.220
He's got a think.
He's got to also think after the Maya fight,

2011
01:58:32.221 --> 01:58:35.550
that mag is a little suspect on the ground.
I had this passion to weak side.

2012
01:58:36.590 --> 01:58:39.870
That's Neil's biggest.
If you have to pick something that's on purpose,

2013
01:58:39.871 --> 01:58:42.040
grappling off his

2014
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:46.390
<v 4>back office back when Neil,
just so it goes a cardio machine.</v>

2015
01:58:46.391 --> 01:58:50.260
He's the same guy for every round.
That's so big.

2016
01:58:50.530 --> 01:58:53.600
If he could just add the other skills on top of that,

2017
01:58:53.740 --> 01:58:58.240
that cardio that he has is such a giant advantage.
Hopefully mentally,

2018
01:58:58.241 --> 01:59:00.380
let's say he were to lose this fight,
worst case scenario,

2019
01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:03.430
and he's lost two in a row.
He can,
he's come up a seven fight win streak.

2020
01:59:03.460 --> 01:59:04.510
What a change.

2021
01:59:04.750 --> 01:59:07.780
You go from seven fight win streak that losing tune or out within two weeks.

2022
01:59:07.781 --> 01:59:08.614
Yeah,
that's true.

2023
01:59:08.680 --> 01:59:11.680
I think in a certain point you need to be known for some kind of offensive

2024
01:59:11.681 --> 01:59:12.071
weapon.

2025
01:59:12.071 --> 01:59:15.520
Like they got to watch out for this or that because you've been blasting people.

2026
01:59:15.521 --> 01:59:19.030
If you don't have that fucking special power or two or three,

2027
01:59:19.660 --> 01:59:21.160
you're not going to be able to hang at the top.

2028
01:59:21.520 --> 01:59:24.490
The top echelon that they're worried about,

2029
01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:27.640
you know I called Cardio though.
He's got a lot of car.

2030
01:59:28.500 --> 01:59:32.170
It took them that a certain distance and now he needs some fire with exactly

2031
01:59:32.171 --> 01:59:34.780
what I said.
Hit me his head coach Lisa,
we're talking.
I said,

2032
01:59:34.990 --> 01:59:37.330
you're going to get to a certain point with those cardio's and winning off

2033
01:59:37.331 --> 01:59:40.150
points.
You didn't get a bad motherfuckers going out.
Nah Man,

2034
01:59:40.180 --> 01:59:43.520
this ain't gonna work.
Damien.
Maia was like,
Oh,
you're good at comedy.

2035
01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:48.490
Doesn't care about your cardio and silver here.
So over here is looking good.

2036
01:59:49.090 --> 01:59:53.110
Oh look at this magazine

2037
01:59:58.390 --> 02:00:03.380
full mouth.
Fuck.
Look at this shit.
Come on man.

2038
02:00:03.900 --> 02:00:06.860
Magni looking good.
Don't look into that second hook sign.

2039
02:00:07.090 --> 02:00:10.800
This control son under hook on the left side gives them that second Herrick

2040
02:00:11.050 --> 02:00:15.610
under her
tracks.
He's going to get down to the ground.
Either way.

2041
02:00:15.610 --> 02:00:19.450
This is good for Neil.
This kind of,
this is all this as a wound is gone.

2042
02:00:19.451 --> 02:00:20.201
This is good for Neil.

2043
02:00:20.201 --> 02:00:23.080
What's what we're saying about like the Matte Brown fight that Eric just could

2044
02:00:23.081 --> 02:00:25.720
not keep up with Matt Brown.
So for a guy like that,

2045
02:00:25.900 --> 02:00:28.840
like he's got to realize now that he's been there before and he's drown.

2046
02:00:29.020 --> 02:00:32.290
You got to realize,
okay,
I got to figure out how to be able to sustain this.

2047
02:00:32.291 --> 02:00:34.720
If it's possible,
how can be this shit?

2048
02:00:34.750 --> 02:00:36.400
Maybe he's going to be fine with this cardio.

2049
02:00:36.510 --> 02:00:39.610
Like he watched that fight and I'm sure it's corner set.

2050
02:00:39.611 --> 02:00:40.900
Do we got to get your cardio together?

2051
02:00:41.110 --> 02:00:43.960
If there were smart they would be honest with them.

2052
02:00:43.980 --> 02:00:45.890
I think it's kind of a power thing though too.

2053
02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:49.960
Like if either your cardio guy or you're not like Neil's never can be a knockout

2054
02:00:49.961 --> 02:00:54.040
artist.
He's always going to be a,
that's true.
Things came,
knocks people out.

2055
02:00:54.670 --> 02:00:59.440
Robbie Lawler knocks people the fuck out.
Well,
they have both.
They have both.

2056
02:00:59.470 --> 02:01:04.470
Like came to garner Nogueira bigfoot Silva.

2057
02:01:05.070 --> 02:01:07.870
Yeah.
I mean he should have,
I mean he put a fucking,

2058
02:01:10.590 --> 02:01:14.200
whoa.
Oh
Shit.

2059
02:01:14.350 --> 02:01:16.990
Oh Shit.
Levine taking a close look.

2060
02:01:18.260 --> 02:01:22.360
Legal man let that shit go.
He's a good one for that.
He does let things go.

2061
02:01:22.390 --> 02:01:26.990
I may have Gustafson in my top five handsome guys are still on that Sun.

2062
02:01:27.010 --> 02:01:30.730
That's a thing you have for Europeans.
That's not always,

2063
02:01:31.070 --> 02:01:34.360
he's a handsome Tony Bro.
Honestly,

2064
02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:38.830
he's got a perfect Swedish phase,
perfect genetic sex,

2065
02:01:39.170 --> 02:01:40.310
but he's not really ripped

2066
02:01:41.240 --> 02:01:43.970
<v 1>muscular like that vampire from true blood</v>

2067
02:01:47.050 --> 02:01:47.883
women,

2068
02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:54.890
you know in Sweden for many years,

2069
02:01:54.891 --> 02:01:59.460
they sterilize kids that didn't have symmetric,
perfectly symmetrical faces.

2070
02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:02.760
That a fact.
It's actually nice.
That's awesome.
Shit.

2071
02:02:03.070 --> 02:02:07.400
That's why they're so good looking because they stick at all.
No,
no.
Look into it.

2072
02:02:07.401 --> 02:02:11.810
You think that you think that's crazy?
When you say look into it,

2073
02:02:11.811 --> 02:02:16.570
did you look into it?
I got my brother was from Sweden and he hasn't,
he's

2074
02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:20.440
not at all.
It looks like state.

2075
02:02:20.620 --> 02:02:24.930
They had them in the woods and they kept him from the fishery.
That's crazy.

2076
02:02:26.130 --> 02:02:30.440
Crazy.
This is all you need to do.

2077
02:02:30.441 --> 02:02:33.530
Just Google it and pull up some studies and some peer reviewed papers.

2078
02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:36.540
That's what we did.
She had a phone right in front of you,
brother.

2079
02:02:38.020 --> 02:02:41.930
I started off with,
this is what I heard,

2080
02:02:47.770 --> 02:02:52.540
but I'm not saying it's true.
I have looked
bullshit.

2081
02:02:52.660 --> 02:02:54.220
I don't know.
You know what?

2082
02:02:54.360 --> 02:02:59.360
If I choose [inaudible] dot com says that Swedish jails or pick up the best

2083
02:02:59.841 --> 02:03:00.501
place it can be.

2084
02:03:00.501 --> 02:03:05.501
If you Google Swedish eugenics in like the 1930 [inaudible] at first I didn't

2085
02:03:07.641 --> 02:03:11.080
say what's true.
I just said,
hey,
there's some rumors out there.
Alright,

2086
02:03:11.300 --> 02:03:14.380
here's the sacrifice.
Shit.
Hell,
let's see.
Let's see if Eric could,

2087
02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:18.140
silver gets 60 planes.
Silva's hands are very low here.
It's very,

2088
02:03:18.141 --> 02:03:21.200
so it's highly fights.
These,
this first like two minutes,

2089
02:03:21.201 --> 02:03:22.750
super dangerous for Neil silver.

2090
02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:26.270
Looks like I get them down looking for that spinning back kick to the body,

2091
02:03:26.271 --> 02:03:29.750
but didn't land it.
He looks like he's so open to get punched in the face.

2092
02:03:29.780 --> 02:03:30.890
He doesn't look tired at all

2093
02:03:32.510 --> 02:03:37.160
while he's gotta think he got must have done some serious cardio or is ignoring

2094
02:03:37.161 --> 02:03:39.110
his fault.
Magni looks exhausted.

2095
02:03:42.070 --> 02:03:45.080
So controversial.
Magni always looks exactly the same.

2096
02:03:45.081 --> 02:03:48.320
And every fight he's always in shape.
Yup.
What does he do for Cardio?

2097
02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:50.010
He just trains nonstop man.

2098
02:03:50.680 --> 02:03:55.680
That his strength coach Loren Landow hasn't sleds and fricking sprint's has ever

2099
02:03:56.460 --> 02:04:00.880
been knocked out.
You Know Maggie?
No.
Oh,
I saw him in the video of cats and Ghana.

2100
02:04:00.881 --> 02:04:05.540
No,
the video.
A training.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They have a whole crew.

2101
02:04:05.541 --> 02:04:10.250
It's like Brandon Thatch.
He got his hurt.
He got hurt to the body there.

2102
02:04:10.550 --> 02:04:12.560
Look at that.
That's where it Cardell comes into play,
man.

2103
02:04:12.561 --> 02:04:17.561
He recovered way faster even from how much of it advantage train it down to

2104
02:04:18.110 --> 02:04:20.380
Denver.
That's gotta be an advantage.
You know,

2105
02:04:20.390 --> 02:04:24.260
I was one of the things I had a comment con a conversation with about Novitsky.

2106
02:04:24.520 --> 02:04:27.020
I'm like,
what about altitude tents?
How come they're not cheating?

2107
02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:32.030
How much of an advantage?
But he had a good comeback,
Joe,
because he goes,

2108
02:04:32.031 --> 02:04:35.170
I don't think it's that much of a scene.

2109
02:04:35.410 --> 02:04:39.270
It's not the same as when you travel and then so you're in Vegas or wherever

2110
02:04:39.271 --> 02:04:40.560
you're going to fight for a week.

2111
02:04:40.890 --> 02:04:44.310
That all that should equalize is out in like three days.
What do you mean?
Well,

2112
02:04:44.311 --> 02:04:45.980
I brought my,
I mean all the know,

2113
02:04:46.140 --> 02:04:51.140
all the benefits that you have of training to altitude is that true dissipates

2114
02:04:52.200 --> 02:04:55.400
within three days.
Eight days.
And,
but guess what I did take,

2115
02:04:55.440 --> 02:04:57.720
I would bring a hyperbaric chamber wind guys,

2116
02:04:57.740 --> 02:05:01.020
this is a thing called the internet.
And before you go on podcasts and you say,

2117
02:05:01.260 --> 02:05:03.150
I heard Oh,

2118
02:05:03.220 --> 02:05:07.170
Sam from my ex got Dan eugenics studies.
Oh,

2119
02:05:07.900 --> 02:05:11.960
Google.
Sweden.
Google.
Big Foot.

2120
02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:17.580
That's why they're so low back kick.

2121
02:05:18.600 --> 02:05:21.330
They cheated Google Dong Life.
I want to get a tattoo.

2122
02:05:21.331 --> 02:05:23.730
Eric's putting it on right now,
man.
I got to sleeve tattoo.

2123
02:05:24.210 --> 02:05:27.570
You should get something on your face.
Maybe tear drops or a heart.

2124
02:05:27.571 --> 02:05:30.410
And she got knives everywhere I command doesn't,
uh,
yeah.

2125
02:05:30.430 --> 02:05:35.430
Should do what I do knives with Jason Chasing Ellis did Tattoo the whole top of

2126
02:05:36.451 --> 02:05:38.880
your head.
You'll see I have a different animal.

2127
02:05:38.890 --> 02:05:40.980
Do a tiger polar bears some shitty

2128
02:05:43.680 --> 02:05:44.513
shit.

2129
02:05:45.700 --> 02:05:48.960
And elephants they seek to cover over the dumbest because nobody would know what

2130
02:05:50.240 --> 02:05:54.160
a
Shitty

2131
02:05:59.380 --> 02:06:03.180
fucking dodge.
Just so I can be a dick.
A bashing.
Anybody have a snail tattoo?

2132
02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:07.710
Oh I bet there's,
there's gotta be dudes that are obsessed with snails.

2133
02:06:07.711 --> 02:06:12.630
Like who I like to go.
I like a good snail myself.

2134
02:06:13.290 --> 02:06:14.190
Let's see Neil Magnus,

2135
02:06:14.191 --> 02:06:18.900
God on that foreign snails.com I like googling the tattoos that incorporate body

2136
02:06:18.901 --> 02:06:22.200
parts like armpits or vaginas are like assholes.
That right there.

2137
02:06:22.260 --> 02:06:27.240
Oh Shit I get that was Elliot Marshawn down?
Christian Chanel.
Jesus.
Brian.

2138
02:06:27.450 --> 02:06:30.900
Sorry.
So who's that?
Oh,
oh Maggie thrown up.

2139
02:06:30.901 --> 02:06:34.080
Triangles passing.
Oh

2140
02:06:37.180 --> 02:06:41.940
norm.
Good rich
holding.
He turned it off.
It was everything.

2141
02:06:41.941 --> 02:06:44.450
There was chores,
everything.
You got a little hungry right there.
Yup.

2142
02:06:44.580 --> 02:06:48.810
And look at this nice narrow stance by Eric Silva.
Catch that breath son.

2143
02:06:49.090 --> 02:06:52.290
His legs look so different.
His body looks different for sure.

2144
02:06:52.610 --> 02:06:55.380
But does it look bad though?
But he's doing well in the fight.

2145
02:06:55.381 --> 02:06:59.280
It really could be that he changed up the way he trains and he does more

2146
02:06:59.281 --> 02:07:03.060
conditioning stuff,
aerobics stuff than he does strength stuff.
Physically.

2147
02:07:03.061 --> 02:07:05.790
He does look different.
Cut a loss to weight.

2148
02:07:05.970 --> 02:07:08.400
You know the other thing he's got to realize or you've got to,

2149
02:07:08.460 --> 02:07:12.210
we all do is that he's a guy who caught a lot of weight to make one 70 probably

2150
02:07:12.211 --> 02:07:14.610
realize,
I can't fucking do that anymore without the ivs.

2151
02:07:15.180 --> 02:07:17.790
There's a lot of these guys are going to have to lose a tremendous amount of

2152
02:07:17.791 --> 02:07:20.570
weight.
They're going to have to lose like 10 pounds of muscle.
Yup.

2153
02:07:20.820 --> 02:07:23.190
There's a lot of guys are going to have to lose to keep going to be a different

2154
02:07:23.191 --> 02:07:27.960
person,
different person,
different fighter,
different person,
different results.

2155
02:07:28.280 --> 02:07:32.850
It's wonder how many guys at different weight classes out though less weight.

2156
02:07:32.851 --> 02:07:35.230
They had a cut because they already lost a lot of weight.

2157
02:07:35.231 --> 02:07:36.280
It might just even itself

2158
02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:40.770
<v 0>out.
Maybe less a torture to the body.
Less trauma to the body.
Yeah.</v>

2159
02:07:40.920 --> 02:07:44.800
That's possible.
That's super possible.
Having a tough time losing weight.
No,

2160
02:07:45.600 --> 02:07:49.360
he literally trains year round like a gazelle running nonstop.

2161
02:07:49.480 --> 02:07:53.650
Never gets hurt in the gyms.
Never.
That's amazing.
I know man.
He lived with Nate.

2162
02:07:53.651 --> 02:07:56.590
Mark Cart all three years.
It's part of them all the time.
All the time.

2163
02:07:56.620 --> 02:08:00.240
Oh Jesus Christ.
When the first round,
cause Eric Silva has got the second one.

2164
02:08:00.430 --> 02:08:03.420
I think it's one one probably.
Is He American as East Africa?

2165
02:08:03.460 --> 02:08:06.970
Magnesium's American.
He's from Chicago and he was in the service.

2166
02:08:07.210 --> 02:08:10.360
I think guys that have been to war and guys are in the military.

2167
02:08:10.361 --> 02:08:14.050
There's a different consequence to your discipline.
Like a guy like Tim Kennedy.

2168
02:08:14.260 --> 02:08:16.900
Is it different?
He's got a different kind of discipline.

2169
02:08:17.140 --> 02:08:20.740
It's like a tried and tested in battled discipline.

2170
02:08:21.220 --> 02:08:23.320
I just think there's an advantage to having that.

2171
02:08:23.350 --> 02:08:27.130
You just don't see a lot of guys that have that high level discipline and

2172
02:08:27.131 --> 02:08:29.890
military background.
Get an MMA guy like Colt and Smith.

2173
02:08:29.891 --> 02:08:33.490
You've got a few guys that have done it.
Stan,
Stan of course.

2174
02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:36.430
But Stan and I think Tim Kennedy or the highest profile,

2175
02:08:36.431 --> 02:08:38.800
the fought at the highest level.
You don't have to worry about their metal.

2176
02:08:38.870 --> 02:08:42.820
And Kenny,
we're talking about talking to him and he said,

2177
02:08:43.030 --> 02:08:45.780
and his buddy was there and he said,
you're never seeming nervous.
He said,

2178
02:08:45.790 --> 02:08:46.780
because he doesn't get nervous,

2179
02:08:47.020 --> 02:08:50.530
but it kind of makes sense for Guy Tim Kennedy who's been through such extreme

2180
02:08:50.531 --> 02:08:54.490
life and death circumstances and now it's just a fight with means you'll break

2181
02:08:54.491 --> 02:08:58.120
your nose or whatever,
and for him it's like it's a competition.
It's fun.
Well,

2182
02:08:58.121 --> 02:08:58.811
what you were saying,

2183
02:08:58.811 --> 02:09:01.780
it was the craziest fucking thing where you guys were revealing on your podcast

2184
02:09:01.781 --> 02:09:05.650
that Kennedy is still involved in military operation of the spear stuff that's

2185
02:09:05.860 --> 02:09:10.750
fucking up that same Columbia break.
A couple of tip.
That's fucking crazy.
Insane.

2186
02:09:10.780 --> 02:09:11.613
That's crazy.

2187
02:09:11.700 --> 02:09:16.700
[inaudible] he's in the UFC right now and he's still doing conventional special

2188
02:09:17.741 --> 02:09:20.540
option.
Yeah.
Hi.
Locking nuts.
Not,
not like,
you know,

2189
02:09:20.650 --> 02:09:22.750
he talks about when he talks about too,
it's like,
yeah,
go on.

2190
02:09:22.770 --> 02:09:27.760
Six missions at night.
Half of them are gun fights,
like
his best friend,

2191
02:09:28.420 --> 02:09:30.640
his best friend died four days ago when we did the interview.

2192
02:09:30.641 --> 02:09:34.770
It's no cheese operation and an operation he was involved in,
right?
Yeah,

2193
02:09:35.230 --> 02:09:37.930
he was.
He involved in that one lesson there.
He wasn't there for that one.

2194
02:09:37.931 --> 02:09:41.770
Talk about that.
Okay.
Podcast talked to them.
That general,

2195
02:09:41.790 --> 02:09:43.120
you can't reveal details,

2196
02:09:43.570 --> 02:09:46.700
but it's amazing that he's still involved in those operations.
Amen.

2197
02:09:48.340 --> 02:09:52.800
Where's my money?
Where's my money?
Where's my money?
When Tim Kennedy knock,

2198
02:09:53.350 --> 02:09:56.920
when Tim Kennedy knocked out half fail in the towel at the military base,

2199
02:09:57.290 --> 02:10:01.180
the fight for the troops does one of the most emotional moments I have ever seen

2200
02:10:01.181 --> 02:10:04.510
any fighter ever experience inside the octagon.
It was incredible.

2201
02:10:04.511 --> 02:10:05.680
He just jumped on top of the cage.

2202
02:10:05.681 --> 02:10:10.390
There was no cameras on them that we were gone to commercial and he was pointing

2203
02:10:10.391 --> 02:10:13.810
to each individual.
People in the audience just kept saying it.
I love you.

2204
02:10:13.811 --> 02:10:16.930
I love you.
I love all of you.
I love you.
I love you.
I mean,

2205
02:10:17.080 --> 02:10:18.610
they were screaming for him and you scream for it.

2206
02:10:18.620 --> 02:10:21.760
It's a bond that he had with those people,
talks about it.

2207
02:10:21.761 --> 02:10:24.910
He talks about the Oh dude.
He level of bonding.

2208
02:10:24.970 --> 02:10:26.770
When you can smell somebody in the dark,

2209
02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:29.200
you know what they smell like in the dark.
That's what he said.

2210
02:10:29.201 --> 02:10:31.870
He goes that way and you've been through life and death situations.

2211
02:10:31.871 --> 02:10:34.100
I don't think that's a big thing.
Smell.

2212
02:10:36.800 --> 02:10:40.340
<v 1>I don't worry about trying to be dramatic.
We're just glad.</v>

2213
02:10:40.700 --> 02:10:45.360
I'm just glad dudes like that exists.
I'm glad that he ships.

2214
02:10:45.590 --> 02:10:49.230
They're the ones that they're the gatekeepers.
Yeah,
he,
you know,
he,

2215
02:10:49.231 --> 02:10:50.300
he's a different,

2216
02:10:50.720 --> 02:10:54.860
he's even a different athlete than Jon Jones or any of the top athletes in UFC.

2217
02:10:54.861 --> 02:10:59.360
He's a different type of,
Oh shit.
Eric Silver.
Oh,
Neil,
go crack there.

2218
02:10:59.670 --> 02:11:03.200
Oh,
Neil magnet comes back with the knee.
You know,
I'll tell you one thing,

2219
02:11:03.410 --> 02:11:06.290
if I was hanging out with Tate and Joe and one of them farted,

2220
02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:10.280
I would know who far.
That's all.
It's a garden guy in the dark

2221
02:11:15.230 --> 02:11:18.670
smell.
But Tate's might kill you.
Yes.

2222
02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:24.900
No.
That was in my defense.
That was when Eddie was my dietitian

2223
02:11:26.540 --> 02:11:29.300
going like seven 11 before we get on a plane and be like,
Ooh,

2224
02:11:29.360 --> 02:11:31.700
this one's got Maltitol it.
Let's get four of those.

2225
02:11:31.850 --> 02:11:33.470
Eat those and sit next to Joe ideas.

2226
02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:36.790
I need a bunch of Kimchi and then want to tall apparently makes you fart.

2227
02:11:37.250 --> 02:11:42.110
Look at this.
Eric Silva trying to get her magni man,
he just can keep that.

2228
02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:45.890
The only time Magna's been in trouble like where we got t code was in the,

2229
02:11:45.950 --> 02:11:49.640
on the ultimate fighter by my switch stance in his regular UFC career.

2230
02:11:49.641 --> 02:11:53.210
He's really not been broad.
No,
cause it's cardio.
So damn good.

2231
02:11:53.440 --> 02:11:57.270
How's Richie doing these days man?
He's fighting.
He's fighting in Titan.

2232
02:11:58.580 --> 02:12:01.460
Is he doing well?
Yeah,
I think he's done.
All right.
So talented kid.

2233
02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:06.250
I always wondered why I never made it back to the UFC.
Will tighten owns over.

2234
02:12:06.260 --> 02:12:08.480
The UFC owns tight now.
Right?
So he's fighting with Titan.

2235
02:12:08.481 --> 02:12:11.820
So is that a recent deal?
Yeah,
they just,
they thought available on fight pass.

2236
02:12:11.930 --> 02:12:15.310
That's amazing.
Crazy,
right?
It's like a feed or leak and it's not cool.

2237
02:12:16.010 --> 02:12:18.270
Shooto Brazil's on Invicta.

2238
02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:22.360
I think Jason Chambers is doing commentary for shoot Tub Brazil.
Huh?

2239
02:12:22.580 --> 02:12:26.480
I chased column header.
Text him right now.
Yeah,
right to right now.

2240
02:12:27.590 --> 02:12:30.080
Jason,
sorry.
One Minute 50 to go here.

2241
02:12:30.081 --> 02:12:34.610
And Neil magni looking fresh as cheesy.
So we come on,
he doesn't,

2242
02:12:34.611 --> 02:12:35.690
she's got steel is Neil.

2243
02:12:35.691 --> 02:12:39.740
Maggie looks fresh as a daisy Macy's shopping foods.

2244
02:12:40.340 --> 02:12:43.710
She fucking good shape.
Oh my God.
That fucking look at their

2245
02:12:46.170 --> 02:12:50.960
take down easy.
Wilting.
The wilting risk control son.
Long legs.

2246
02:12:50.961 --> 02:12:55.050
This is a big difference between Neil Magni and Eric Silva as far as how much

2247
02:12:55.051 --> 02:12:59.390
you can keep this up.
It's crazy.
That cardio man.
That is nuts.

2248
02:12:59.870 --> 02:13:04.700
Oh my friend.
Oh Shit.

2249
02:13:04.730 --> 02:13:09.280
Is that what she wants you mom,
that just equalize that shit.
Hell yeah.

2250
02:13:13.300 --> 02:13:16.970
Hey,
they equalize each other sort of.
Yeah.
It has so far.

2251
02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:21.380
Eric's silver Atlantic way more shot.
Oh,
your crowd.
They showed the numbers,

2252
02:13:24.260 --> 02:13:27.860
took him down.
He hammered him five or six times and zero strikes.

2253
02:13:27.861 --> 02:13:28.700
Are you watching

2254
02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:35.640
<v 4>in the middle of googling?
Eugenics is squeezed.</v>

2255
02:13:35.641 --> 02:13:39.600
Make occasionally when Eric Silva was on a rampage

2256
02:13:41.100 --> 02:13:43.020
head down like that.
That's a good setup.

2257
02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:48.000
I get my information at the library guys.
I go to the library.
Apple bottom.

2258
02:13:48.001 --> 02:13:51.570
I'm so Bob [inaudible] who goes out library,
go to the library.

2259
02:13:51.720 --> 02:13:55.650
You guys get your information from the Internet.
I go to the library.

2260
02:13:55.651 --> 02:13:59.250
I love horror.
I love how you see the Internet as if it's all the same source.

2261
02:14:00.510 --> 02:14:03.150
I go to the library.
I read this,
the very different,

2262
02:14:03.151 --> 02:14:06.420
these different websites on the Internet is accurate.

2263
02:14:07.050 --> 02:14:09.150
What was the last time somebody went to the library?

2264
02:14:09.151 --> 02:14:12.510
Some guy asked me the other day if I wanted to have someone who is a law,

2265
02:14:12.570 --> 02:14:17.570
a flat earth proponent is apparently the best argue or for a flat or I want to

2266
02:14:19.411 --> 02:14:21.510
hear that argument.
What could they possibly say?

2267
02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:26.720
No fucking way either trolling or retard is weird.
Of course it's Trump,

2268
02:14:26.721 --> 02:14:30.480
but the one thing that's fucking weird is you would think with all the

2269
02:14:30.481 --> 02:14:35.280
satellites we have going in and out of our solar system and how come there's no

2270
02:14:35.281 --> 02:14:38.170
pictures of the earth and like,

2271
02:14:45.320 --> 02:14:48.560
Hey,
I don't know.
Oh,
it's a fat come Brian.
Yes,
they don't

2272
02:14:50.620 --> 02:14:54.810
Google pictures of the earth.
The earth.
You're going to see round earth.

2273
02:14:54.900 --> 02:14:58.170
You're going to seek as a CGI cartoon.
You know what it might be?

2274
02:14:58.171 --> 02:15:00.690
What you would think that'd be all these weird pictures of like the sun here,

2275
02:15:00.691 --> 02:15:01.524
the moon.

2276
02:15:02.850 --> 02:15:07.350
There'll be thousands of Hebron trapper keeper.
When I was a kid,
first of all,

2277
02:15:07.380 --> 02:15:10.980
first of all with the satellites,
they're all inside of 400 miles out,

2278
02:15:11.060 --> 02:15:13.500
most of them at least,
and then when you get past that,

2279
02:15:13.501 --> 02:15:15.930
they usually don't take pictures and they take a few.

2280
02:15:15.930 --> 02:15:17.320
I think they would take a voyager one.

2281
02:15:17.640 --> 02:15:20.560
They show the earth when it's like a little tiny dot.
And the distance I,

2282
02:15:20.570 --> 02:15:23.190
if I'm wrong in there is like thousands of pictures of earth.

2283
02:15:23.191 --> 02:15:26.920
There's just all these weird like the sun here,
the moon,
I don't know

2284
02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:33.960
why are you arguing with satellite like that far out and take pictures.

2285
02:15:33.961 --> 02:15:35.790
They've only sent a few of those out there.

2286
02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:41.070
They've only sent a couple different satellites.
No,
but sure.

2287
02:15:41.071 --> 02:15:44.970
There is hundreds of pictures on the Internet that you can see of the earth with

2288
02:15:44.971 --> 02:15:48.480
the sun in the background,
the Moon,
the Moon,
moon,
Sun,
but any,

2289
02:15:48.580 --> 02:15:51.390
you can see the earth rounded from space.

2290
02:15:52.380 --> 02:15:57.380
It hit the bench maybe has never been

2291
02:15:59.510 --> 02:16:02.270
more controversial beginning.

2292
02:16:04.440 --> 02:16:09.440
I just want to see because there's no where that literally if we're that

2293
02:16:13.590 --> 02:16:18.540
is not,
it's not a joke.
I hope this is all bullshit for sure.

2294
02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:19.473
Oh,
I hope

2295
02:16:23.400 --> 02:16:25.830
usually I can kind of everybody out Eddie.
But yeah,

2296
02:16:25.890 --> 02:16:29.650
that the earth is so ranch or photos.
Those are cartoon photos.

2297
02:16:29.680 --> 02:16:32.440
There's the one real photos and the Apollo 11 moon missions.

2298
02:16:36.600 --> 02:16:39.360
Ooh,
we got some decision.
How did that happen?
Wait,
who won?

2299
02:16:45.760 --> 02:16:49.560
Neil magni plans at home or nothing?

2300
02:16:49.570 --> 02:16:53.130
Olivera Holloway Holloway Grant.
This is,
this is

2301
02:16:54.880 --> 02:16:57.870
always good.
This is the amazing shit.
The one,
the,

2302
02:16:57.930 --> 02:17:02.930
the pictures of earth from like that could be flat space station shit can be

2303
02:17:04.930 --> 02:17:08.470
flat.
Okay.
There's a bunch of pictures.
Okay.

2304
02:17:09.220 --> 02:17:13.570
Fuck that.
Did you say out the two jumps?
Is that what that is?

2305
02:17:13.571 --> 02:17:17.350
Just I think it is.
Yeah.
So Red Bull,
red bull guy right there.

2306
02:17:17.710 --> 02:17:22.690
Did you ditch third grade or
now

2307
02:17:24.290 --> 02:17:26.950
did you take that day off when we were talking about earth or

2308
02:17:28.570 --> 02:17:33.030
what did say
I love it.

2309
02:17:33.370 --> 02:17:36.340
Dammit.
Maybe I'll just pay you $1,000 double or nothing,
man.

2310
02:17:36.700 --> 02:17:37.570
Just paying a thousand.

2311
02:17:37.780 --> 02:17:42.100
You don't want to keep going do 2000 I'm some stupid fucking bet.
Well,

2312
02:17:42.101 --> 02:17:45.910
you could just do the Hallock Gracie method and just pay him and private
lessons.

2313
02:17:46.870 --> 02:17:50.210
That's pretty good too.
Private license,
be nice to,

2314
02:17:50.230 --> 02:17:54.450
that gives me a nice Jesus Christ,
isn't it?
It's not his fault.
It's on.
No,

2315
02:17:54.590 --> 02:17:58.240
it's all his fault and they send it.
I don't know who to believe.

2316
02:17:58.300 --> 02:18:02.200
I don't know what's going on.
Let's not start shit here.

2317
02:18:02.740 --> 02:18:03.573
It's not his fault.

2318
02:18:04.690 --> 02:18:09.190
So Brian tried poaching athletes from Ebi.
I knew that it's still going on.

2319
02:18:09.250 --> 02:18:13.360
I thought you settled that stopped.
I thought,
I think you guys are cool now.

2320
02:18:13.430 --> 02:18:18.130
Fuck no,
no,
no.
Fuck No.
It's ugly.

2321
02:18:18.490 --> 02:18:21.910
Cause I heard you guys.
Hey listen,
I don't,
I'm not going to like,
hey,

2322
02:18:21.911 --> 02:18:23.440
how come you stopped using the crowd?

2323
02:18:23.470 --> 02:18:27.190
Like how come you stopped using a crowd for Brianna Morris does it in black

2324
02:18:27.191 --> 02:18:30.490
house so that they don't have a big overhead now so they just get paper view

2325
02:18:30.780 --> 02:18:34.790
smart.
Huh?
Let me think about it because that's terrible pain

2326
02:18:36.550 --> 02:18:40.840
with no audience.
That's like having a concert.
Let's have a fucking festival,

2327
02:18:40.960 --> 02:18:43.060
but let's not have the audience.
I think that was it.

2328
02:18:43.270 --> 02:18:44.230
I'm thinking about doing that.

2329
02:18:49.210 --> 02:18:51.100
I'm thinking about doing it alone.
Oh my God.

2330
02:18:52.370 --> 02:18:57.060
He just felt just you alone with me.
No opening act,
no camera,
no camera.

2331
02:18:57.100 --> 02:19:00.230
Listen,
I'm just gonna record it on my iPhone and if you're not feeling right,

2332
02:19:01.380 --> 02:19:05.950
if you have an event and nobody shows up and no one's shows up to be in the

2333
02:19:05.951 --> 02:19:09.370
audience,
no matter what happens,
I show socks.
You know what I mean?

2334
02:19:09.670 --> 02:19:13.830
But he's making that happen because he wants to do,
he's doing it.
Pearl says,

2335
02:19:13.831 --> 02:19:18.010
especially with this foreign is a lot of good actors are that it's nice if you

2336
02:19:18.011 --> 02:19:22.140
could pan down,
go god,
there's Hixon Gracie,
or I don't think it's a good life.

2337
02:19:22.270 --> 02:19:24.340
I know what we're talking about.
A Nice thing to fill.

2338
02:19:24.370 --> 02:19:25.930
We're talking about what the UFC should do,

2339
02:19:25.931 --> 02:19:28.040
what the commission should do and what this

2340
02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:31.370
<v 0>show should do.
I don't think that's a good move from at metamorris.</v>

2341
02:19:31.580 --> 02:19:36.260
I want Metamorris to succeed.
I hope that I can beat it in Metamorris.

2342
02:19:36.440 --> 02:19:39.800
It's a good thing that we have all these shows.
I'm not against Metamorris.

2343
02:19:39.801 --> 02:19:43.100
I just think he's making a decisions,
bad decisions.

2344
02:19:43.101 --> 02:19:46.460
That's how I really believe in.
I think the majority agrees with you.
Yeah.

2345
02:19:46.490 --> 02:19:48.050
You know,
and uh,

2346
02:19:48.080 --> 02:19:51.590
I think it's why he would love that there's a show out there and there's going

2347
02:19:51.591 --> 02:19:55.370
to be super fights,
uh,
being put on.
I'm not against that shit.

2348
02:19:56.820 --> 02:20:00.540
That's how you might think you're just a second effect.
Ed,
here's,

2349
02:20:00.620 --> 02:20:02.090
here's the thing about Ebr though.

2350
02:20:02.091 --> 02:20:05.870
You've thrown a monkey wrench in the whole game with us overtime scenarios,

2351
02:20:05.871 --> 02:20:09.140
those,
it makes everything so much better.
You know,
first I was like,

2352
02:20:09.141 --> 02:20:11.840
how's this gonna work?
This is when you were telling me about it.
I didn't,

2353
02:20:12.050 --> 02:20:15.360
I didn't have the vision,
but then the first time I went and saw it live or want,

2354
02:20:15.380 --> 02:20:16.880
that's the,
what's so powerful.

2355
02:20:16.881 --> 02:20:20.030
It's the way it's the hunter because you would go through these matches,

2356
02:20:20.031 --> 02:20:23.150
they would hit 20 minutes and it'd be no finish and that would be the end of it.

2357
02:20:23.151 --> 02:20:26.270
But now there's a finish and a whole lot of those matches.

2358
02:20:26.271 --> 02:20:29.530
And if there's no finish,
it's still crazy because you,

2359
02:20:29.531 --> 02:20:32.660
you're almost getting finished cause you're starting off in a three quarter

2360
02:20:32.661 --> 02:20:36.800
position.
You start off with your back taken over on there,
been to one

2361
02:20:38.390 --> 02:20:41.960
shoot.
The best grappler show ever been by far the best grappling show.

2362
02:20:41.961 --> 02:20:45.950
It's the solution to the problem.
Everyone tells me it was amazing.
Eddie.

2363
02:20:45.960 --> 02:20:50.780
No hiding there in that it's not just no hiding.
You're putting in danger,

2364
02:20:50.990 --> 02:20:52.070
you're put in danger.

2365
02:20:52.120 --> 02:20:56.240
It's like everybody gets putting people to go to overtime and the people,

2366
02:20:56.270 --> 02:21:01.270
most of the reviews have 90% no shit have been super positive.

2367
02:21:01.580 --> 02:21:04.800
It's incredible.
I can't believe it.
That's amazing.
The Internet,

2368
02:21:06.010 --> 02:21:09.560
it's incredible.
Just nothing but positive,
positive,
positive,

2369
02:21:09.561 --> 02:21:12.770
positive and occasionally people say,
I hate the overtime rounds.

2370
02:21:12.771 --> 02:21:15.650
They suck because it's not fair that we put,
you know,

2371
02:21:15.860 --> 02:21:18.010
you're going to get a guy who couldn't pass the garden,

2372
02:21:18.020 --> 02:21:21.050
couldn't get his back naturally.
Now you're going to take me to,

2373
02:21:21.051 --> 02:21:25.850
over time you're going to put that guy on the back who couldn't earn that on his

2374
02:21:25.851 --> 02:21:29.000
own.
Like,
who cares?
We're just trying to make it exciting.
It's gangster.

2375
02:21:29.120 --> 02:21:32.770
I want you to hate over time.
What?
You know what's really funny?
You hear that,

2376
02:21:32.870 --> 02:21:35.390
that argument a lot of times from wrestlers,

2377
02:21:35.740 --> 02:21:38.760
which is so ironic because wrestling in,

2378
02:21:38.840 --> 02:21:41.290
they'll start on their knees with guy behind them again,

2379
02:21:41.291 --> 02:21:43.790
one hand and their waste.
What are you talking about?

2380
02:21:43.791 --> 02:21:48.791
Like you start in a disadvantage position all the time and it's a big part of

2381
02:21:48.981 --> 02:21:52.670
high school and college wrestling,
but at a,
you didn't lose any of competitors,

2382
02:21:52.671 --> 02:21:56.860
right?
You guys are all good now.
No,
he did.
I did.
Oh,
you did one contract.

2383
02:21:56.861 --> 02:22:00.800
He went after he went after a Ebi.
Ebi Three was announced.

2384
02:22:01.400 --> 02:22:05.540
It was the one 70 welterweight and the returning champion was,
it's Gary Tonin.

2385
02:22:05.600 --> 02:22:10.310
He was coming back for sure.
And uh,
I'm Dillon Dannis,
who I didn't,

2386
02:22:10.370 --> 02:22:12.590
I didn't even know who Dylan down it was,
to be honest with you.

2387
02:22:12.591 --> 02:22:15.980
I don't really keep up with what's going on in the Geeky Ibj JF Shea.

2388
02:22:15.981 --> 02:22:18.380
I really don't.
You'd have to be a superstar for me to know who you are.

2389
02:22:18.680 --> 02:22:21.140
So Dylan Dennis comes to me,
he comes to my school and says,

2390
02:22:21.200 --> 02:22:24.560
I want to go into Ebi.
Want to go against Gary?
Tony,
I think I could beat him.

2391
02:22:24.890 --> 02:22:26.160
And I didn't even know he was,
I go,

2392
02:22:26.400 --> 02:22:29.130
<v 4>ah,
I can't promise you anything,
but you know,
let me look into you.</v>

2393
02:22:29.131 --> 02:22:33.030
And now he came and he trained and,
and I looked into him,
I'm like,
Holy Shit,

2394
02:22:33.150 --> 02:22:38.150
this guy has a freaking freak brown belt who's killing everybody in absolute.

2395
02:22:38.880 --> 02:22:42.570
He just went gold after go.
Just tapping everybody.
My Hell fucking yes.

2396
02:22:42.720 --> 02:22:46.080
Texted them and go,
you're in Sun.
And then they started talking Shit,

2397
02:22:46.230 --> 02:22:49.410
Gary Tonin in Dallas,
Dylan,
Dennis on the Internet on Facebook.

2398
02:22:49.411 --> 02:22:51.120
I hope I get you in the first round.
Blah,
blah blah.

2399
02:22:51.240 --> 02:22:53.910
So there was some height building.
I'm like,
this is a foreign perfect.

2400
02:22:54.210 --> 02:22:58.370
And then how it comes in and offers Dylan,
Dennis and Gary Tonin,

2401
02:22:58.930 --> 02:23:03.540
uh,
exclusive contracts,
Dylan bar a bit.
And Gary said,
Fuck No.

2402
02:23:03.870 --> 02:23:08.640
So he almost got them both.
Both my,
my top seeds,
he almost got to both.

2403
02:23:08.641 --> 02:23:11.580
And I was already hyping the show.
He got billion,
but he didn't get Gary.

2404
02:23:11.580 --> 02:23:13.740
Thank God the show went off.
And,
uh,

2405
02:23:13.800 --> 02:23:17.820
Gary ended up winning and it was a great show and it got great reviews.
So,

2406
02:23:17.880 --> 02:23:21.810
but he,
if,
if Gary would have agreed to this,
you know,

2407
02:23:21.811 --> 02:23:24.510
and with Alex says is anytime anybody brings this up,

2408
02:23:24.660 --> 02:23:27.480
he just distracts everybody and says,
Hey,

2409
02:23:27.481 --> 02:23:30.840
the UFC does exclusive contracts or I'm just doing what the UFC is doing.

2410
02:23:30.841 --> 02:23:32.620
It's like,
it's not about exclusive contracts.

2411
02:23:32.880 --> 02:23:37.650
You specifically went after my top two guys and my show and you try to ruin my

2412
02:23:37.651 --> 02:23:41.970
show.
But the UFC,
you're,
you,
you talk shit on the UFC then the UFC does that,

2413
02:23:42.120 --> 02:23:45.120
you know,
so what an arrogant.
It's a distraction.

2414
02:23:45.150 --> 02:23:49.410
He's distressed that you are the UFC.
Yeah.
You're not.
And seriously,

2415
02:23:49.411 --> 02:23:53.940
I at that point,
I dine of scarcity,
tearing a ne like stop it.

2416
02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.640
I thought we were cool.
I actually thought me and Alec were cool.

2417
02:23:56.760 --> 02:23:58.920
I thought we were working together.
I thought,
hey,
you know,

2418
02:23:58.921 --> 02:24:03.790
you need some mission specialist for your show.
Your show gets a lot of uh,
uh,

2419
02:24:03.870 --> 02:24:05.940
bad reviews because of the board.
And that's the,

2420
02:24:05.970 --> 02:24:08.540
that's the big problem with you just to,
just like Joe was saying in Jujitsu,

2421
02:24:08.630 --> 02:24:12.060
I like how do you remove the boredom from it?
Because it's like playing chess.

2422
02:24:12.400 --> 02:24:15.300
A lot of people really in the chest,
it's a,
it's a very complicated,

2423
02:24:15.301 --> 02:24:18.390
sophisticated,
a little game,
but you're not going to put it on Fox.

2424
02:24:18.480 --> 02:24:22.560
You'll never have it on Fox.
Although the game is,
has a lot of prestige and,

2425
02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:26.670
and a lot of respect behind it,
but you're never going to see it on,
on,
on TV.

2426
02:24:26.730 --> 02:24:31.450
How are Jujitsu?
Jujitsu is exactly the same way.
Jujitsu.

2427
02:24:33.030 --> 02:24:36.990
Good.
Jujitsu is very intricate,
very sophisticated,

2428
02:24:37.110 --> 02:24:40.140
beautiful delay.
They're using the Gooey,
that control button,

2429
02:24:40.350 --> 02:24:44.310
but you're just not going to put it on TV.
It's just too much holding.

2430
02:24:44.340 --> 02:24:47.500
It's just not going to happen.
You can't put,
it's like chess.
Even guys who know?

2431
02:24:47.501 --> 02:24:50.760
Did you?
So I noticed when I've been at Metamora black belts don't even like,

2432
02:24:51.730 --> 02:24:54.380
I don't even watch it.
They don't even watch it.

2433
02:24:54.420 --> 02:24:58.620
It's black belt legends don't even keep track of the moon,
the owls.

2434
02:24:58.860 --> 02:25:02.280
So that's the problem right there.
The problem,
you've got to recognize it and go,

2435
02:25:02.281 --> 02:25:06.900
okay,
if we want a show,
if we want to do Jitsu to,
to uh,
you know,

2436
02:25:06.901 --> 02:25:10.650
let's say get on TV or get to the,
to the highest platform possible,

2437
02:25:10.830 --> 02:25:15.030
we got to do everything possible to remove the big problem,

2438
02:25:15.060 --> 02:25:18.310
the board of the stall,
the whole suggest,
would you suggest,
um,

2439
02:25:19.080 --> 02:25:23.370
points for like,
I dunno,
I mean never member,

2440
02:25:24.970 --> 02:25:27.490
no matter what selling system you come up with,
right.

2441
02:25:27.610 --> 02:25:29.590
It's a point is a point is a point.

2442
02:25:29.800 --> 02:25:33.280
If passing the guard is one point or it's 15 points,

2443
02:25:33.490 --> 02:25:37.540
it's still your up and now there's no urgency to make the move.

2444
02:25:37.541 --> 02:25:40.540
Your coaches are going slow down.
You've got a minute left,
don't do shit.

2445
02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:43.540
Don't try to plug you pass the guard.
Don't do nothing.
Don't do nothing.

2446
02:25:43.720 --> 02:25:48.460
The coaching is stalling.
You're the athlete.
If he's smart,
he stalling.

2447
02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:51.220
I feel like that doesn't,
five minute of that,
it's too short.

2448
02:25:51.250 --> 02:25:54.790
You can't have any points to study.
You did.
You can't have any points.

2449
02:25:56.700 --> 02:25:58.370
You got to eliminate the points you've got.

2450
02:25:58.400 --> 02:26:02.970
He's talking about points over here and God dammit,
karate background help me.

2451
02:26:02.980 --> 02:26:04.450
It's gotta be conventional karate,

2452
02:26:04.780 --> 02:26:08.920
taekwondo and there had to be an overtime that they determined a winner.

2453
02:26:08.950 --> 02:26:11.620
You fixed it.
You know what's the next show?

2454
02:26:12.130 --> 02:26:15.850
December 13 Austin tests in time.
December 3rd toss in Texas.

2455
02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:20.800
This one's going to be a special one.
I'm still piecing it together.

2456
02:26:20.860 --> 02:26:24.760
It's,
I can't really talk about it too much.
Way Too early.
Yes.
Ebi Five.

2457
02:26:24.970 --> 02:26:27.610
You can see Ebi through the Hallux going to compete in yours.

2458
02:26:28.060 --> 02:26:31.190
It's absolutely true.
He's going against Brown and shop.

2459
02:26:33.580 --> 02:26:36.250
Saw It on Twitter.

2460
02:26:41.400 --> 02:26:46.180
I'll all I'm trying to do,
I'm just trying to make Jujitsu entertaining.

2461
02:26:46.620 --> 02:26:50.800
Uh,
uh,
for the masses.
That's it.
You're joining.
Hey Eddie,

2462
02:26:50.801 --> 02:26:53.620
you're about to lose two grand on this main event.
My man,

2463
02:26:53.770 --> 02:26:56.800
I had ingredient I didn't agree to that last is on Bro.

2464
02:26:56.801 --> 02:26:59.020
I love that he's wearing glasses.
You know what?
Fuck it.

2465
02:26:59.720 --> 02:27:04.540
Will you take a check or check cash or check my,

2466
02:27:04.780 --> 02:27:06.910
you will take a chat cause I don't have the cash.

2467
02:27:06.970 --> 02:27:10.790
It's kind of weird that all vera comes out kind of class.
We'll do think

2468
02:27:12.420 --> 02:27:16.270
vision issues.
He should bad.
I mean it's,
it's weird.

2469
02:27:16.271 --> 02:27:19.240
There's vision issues are so bad that he wants to wear his glasses up until the

2470
02:27:19.241 --> 02:27:21.660
time when he gets in the AUC,
he's probably going to paying for it.
They're clear.

2471
02:27:21.690 --> 02:27:24.300
No,
no,
you don't.
You don't just engage.
He,

2472
02:27:24.301 --> 02:27:29.301
he's the world series of fighting world champ at one 70 he has 5,555 yet here's

2473
02:27:29.951 --> 02:27:32.170
these glasses.
You take them off.
He couldn't,

2474
02:27:32.410 --> 02:27:36.970
he can recognize you like he has to squint so bad.
Wow.
It's crazy.

2475
02:27:37.190 --> 02:27:39.710
It's so funny.
No,
he's just horrible eyes.

2476
02:27:39.850 --> 02:27:42.500
So he's wearing glasses to fight or not fight with contacts.

2477
02:27:43.400 --> 02:27:46.870
You have to kill the condition.
They can't fuck with contacts or Lasik.

2478
02:27:46.930 --> 02:27:51.410
They used to fight with contact lasik.
Either know,
they ask if you've had it,

2479
02:27:51.411 --> 02:27:53.710
it just wasn't banned.
Yeah.
Well,
lasix,

2480
02:27:53.740 --> 02:27:57.010
there's two different ways of doing it and lasix is the most vulnerable way.

2481
02:27:57.011 --> 02:28:01.240
There's another way of doing it that it takes longer to heal and it's like

2482
02:28:01.330 --> 02:28:04.660
actual surge structure with a p.
Right?
I don't know.
I don't remember.

2483
02:28:04.870 --> 02:28:07.420
There's two different,
I might,
I might be even saying wrong.
No,
you're right.

2484
02:28:07.421 --> 02:28:08.500
Six is more vulnerable,

2485
02:28:08.710 --> 02:28:10.960
but there's two different ways and one of the more common way,

2486
02:28:11.140 --> 02:28:14.410
you're not supposed to have contact sports because if you get rocked that,

2487
02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:17.470
that stitching or the tearing,
wherever the cut,

2488
02:28:17.560 --> 02:28:21.330
the scar tissue could open up and you're,
you're fucked.
He's,

2489
02:28:22.610 --> 02:28:26.640
<v 1>that's usually a bad sign.
He was like in raptures I lads,
I,</v>

2490
02:28:26.830 --> 02:28:29.030
he's probably listening to some Jesus music or something.

2491
02:28:29.990 --> 02:28:33.110
Do you know why it doesn't hurt when they laser your eyes?
Legit point.
Right?

2492
02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:37.490
Legit point.
Why?
Why isn't your,
I believe you have nerve endings in your eye.

2493
02:28:37.520 --> 02:28:39.770
You know why I believe that?
Because when I go into the Cryo Chamber,

2494
02:28:39.771 --> 02:28:44.380
my eyes never heard.
They don't even get cold
laser.

2495
02:28:44.820 --> 02:28:49.250
You're awake.
You're conscious lasik.
It was pretty freaky.
My man really freaky,

2496
02:28:49.251 --> 02:28:50.390
but not painful.
You wait a minute.

2497
02:28:50.391 --> 02:28:52.880
You had lasix and you can't find any more then.
Well,
no,

2498
02:28:52.881 --> 02:28:57.640
I had never told him I did it.
We just did you fuck Jesus Christ?
Oh No.

2499
02:28:57.730 --> 02:29:02.720
Now you're doing
two.
They're going to sue you.

2500
02:29:02.721 --> 02:29:05.540
MMA media.
Brendan Schaub lies under oath about Lacey.

2501
02:29:07.370 --> 02:29:12.350
I got it when I was playing football.
Oh my God.
So you lied,
you said No.

2502
02:29:12.410 --> 02:29:15.290
What are you going to do?
Oh my God,
we're going to do now.

2503
02:29:15.640 --> 02:29:17.510
Maybe you're kidding about getting lasik visa.

2504
02:29:17.511 --> 02:29:19.720
You must be kidding about getting it and I think you're kidding about it.

2505
02:29:19.750 --> 02:29:23.690
I maybe I'm lying.
Maybe he's lying.
This is all for entertainment folks.

2506
02:29:24.020 --> 02:29:27.140
I don't really think Conor McGregor doesn't have the legitimate international

2507
02:29:27.400 --> 02:29:32.340
intermediate intermittent belts with like you're crazy.

2508
02:29:32.341 --> 02:29:35.750
You don't think that's a headline?
I hope against the headline.

2509
02:29:35.751 --> 02:29:38.060
I want to literally already going.
Literally all of them are like,

2510
02:29:38.061 --> 02:29:41.800
we got down to those last time.
Is it possible for downloads?

2511
02:29:41.810 --> 02:29:42.620
Can't get any bigger.

2512
02:29:42.620 --> 02:29:45.410
I'm going to start doing some research and millions of downloads for this show.

2513
02:29:46.040 --> 02:29:49.520
Is it possible for Joey Diaz to do to impression of Conor McGregor?

2514
02:29:49.640 --> 02:29:53.000
Is that even possible?
Yeah,
possible.
You Joey would have to watch them,

2515
02:29:53.001 --> 02:29:54.160
but if Joey,
what I'm talking about,

2516
02:29:54.170 --> 02:29:57.800
you do an impression of Joey doing an impression of what kind of allowed you to

2517
02:29:57.801 --> 02:30:02.690
take pot cock sucker.
We're going to take over.
Who's done what?
I've done.

2518
02:30:03.520 --> 02:30:05.530
Done,
done.

2519
02:30:10.590 --> 02:30:12.270
I'm doing the shit file and

2520
02:30:15.650 --> 02:30:20.330
walked up.
Fuck.
Think about what the fuck.
Eddie Bravo.

2521
02:30:20.990 --> 02:30:24.200
I love how he calls you.
Your,
your full name.
Brennan it shop.
What's going on?

2522
02:30:24.201 --> 02:30:25.034
Brendan shot

2523
02:30:27.590 --> 02:30:32.590
shows him her actions are world class and if you've ever heard him do a Porsche

2524
02:30:33.051 --> 02:30:35.780
or a rottweiler,
it's about as good as it gets.

2525
02:30:35.781 --> 02:30:40.450
Can you do a portion Porsche there?
Come on.
Come on.

2526
02:30:40.950 --> 02:30:41.783
No,

2527
02:30:46.350 --> 02:30:51.260
he does amazing
grizzly.
He does a sick Kodiak anesthesia.

2528
02:30:51.350 --> 02:30:55.010
I'll do a couple of noises.
Grizzly too.

2529
02:30:57.330 --> 02:30:58.163
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

2530
02:31:07.840 --> 02:31:11.430
<v 1>the abdominal snowman.
That's that bitch from that.
That movie.
Was it the ring?</v>

2531
02:31:13.800 --> 02:31:15.070
That's actually a big book.

2532
02:31:15.280 --> 02:31:16.113
<v 5>Really?</v>

2533
02:31:18.440 --> 02:31:20.010
<v 1>Joints when he wakes up in the morning.
Oh my</v>

2534
02:31:20.010 --> 02:31:20.843
<v 0>God.</v>

2535
02:31:21.150 --> 02:31:24.990
Didn't you say the Noguera has to have like someone to work on his back for over

2536
02:31:24.990 --> 02:31:27.780
an hour before he actually works now what does he do?

2537
02:31:27.840 --> 02:31:31.340
He gets a Thai girl to walk on his hamstring sorts of stuff.
You gotta do it?

2538
02:31:31.360 --> 02:31:35.880
Everyone told me.
Oh don't worry.
It takes them an hour just to,
just to get ready.

2539
02:31:35.920 --> 02:31:40.890
Like,
I don't give a fuck.
Wow.
This is a great fucking fight.

2540
02:31:40.891 --> 02:31:43.490
We're about to watch here.
Max Huddle,
by the way,
how fun.

2541
02:31:43.500 --> 02:31:46.260
He's got down fight companion and the best I was looking forward to this all
day.

2542
02:31:46.380 --> 02:31:50.910
I was immersed in girl activities.
My daughters and my wife saw this girl,
girl,

2543
02:31:50.911 --> 02:31:51.630
Girl Shit.

2544
02:31:51.630 --> 02:31:56.370
And I'm looking at that clock and six hours I get to be the man.

2545
02:31:58.620 --> 02:32:02.100
It's almost over.
We got 15 minutes of manhood.
We can talk manly shit,

2546
02:32:02.130 --> 02:32:06.210
talk shit to each other.
Brian's going to take us to dinner,
dude.

2547
02:32:06.211 --> 02:32:09.720
I watched him get an angel wings,
real housewives of Beverly Hills today.

2548
02:32:09.750 --> 02:32:13.400
Today I was working out in my little gym and uh,

2549
02:32:13.410 --> 02:32:17.790
it was on and I watched it and watched these bitches screaming each other and

2550
02:32:17.791 --> 02:32:21.540
watching these girls turn each other.
And Mike,
how bizarre are,

2551
02:32:21.630 --> 02:32:25.260
is this behavior and how bizarre is these women?
I'll watch that shit.

2552
02:32:25.320 --> 02:32:29.390
I will watch
the hot,
hot,

2553
02:32:29.760 --> 02:32:32.750
hot girls of loss or the hot wives of Las Vegas.

2554
02:32:32.800 --> 02:32:36.200
You're talking about wags wives and girlfriends of celebrities and man,

2555
02:32:36.210 --> 02:32:38.650
I just saw it on a bus the other day.
It was

2556
02:32:41.280 --> 02:32:44.790
probably so many shows,
pieces.

2557
02:32:44.910 --> 02:32:49.650
They're tired of lives.
Nobody wants that anymore.
Well,
if they fight,

2558
02:32:49.710 --> 02:32:51.210
it's good.
Here's a local meetups.

2559
02:32:51.220 --> 02:32:55.650
It fights torturing some poor guy that sucked into this existence.

2560
02:32:55.830 --> 02:32:57.850
I'm sorry.
Nobody wants to see the hot housewives.

2561
02:32:57.920 --> 02:33:00.810
I and there's a lot of that is spoken,

2562
02:33:01.610 --> 02:33:06.390
Dan getting dumb route and this is very important bro.
Who's up right now?

2563
02:33:06.391 --> 02:33:08.690
Who's up somebody hallway.
Hallway.

2564
02:33:09.090 --> 02:33:12.120
But who is up in the bedding here between you told me what did you,

2565
02:33:12.121 --> 02:33:15.790
what was going on $3,000 which fight double or nothing.

2566
02:33:17.520 --> 02:33:22.320
Did you bet on Maggie?
Maggie and then I,
yeah,
from the Magni fine.
No,
no.

2567
02:33:22.321 --> 02:33:26.860
500 now betting another down.
But we had another 500 100 cause it remembered you.

2568
02:33:26.861 --> 02:33:31.470
I won the 500 on clover.
Oh,
it's right on.
It's right here.
Damn.

2569
02:33:31.471 --> 02:33:36.450
He get he bet against clover.
Clover Versus Pat Commons is a tough fight.

2570
02:33:36.510 --> 02:33:38.220
What do you think about that fight?
Sick.

2571
02:33:38.370 --> 02:33:42.900
A bummer when Pat's my [inaudible] for Patterson.

2572
02:33:42.990 --> 02:33:47.310
The glove was just,
to me that's a big statement about how you feel about Glover.

2573
02:33:47.370 --> 02:33:50.820
I Love Pat Man.
I love Pat.
He's my closest train partner.
When we were,

2574
02:33:50.880 --> 02:33:54.750
when I was fighting,
you know,
and if I could pick a horrible matchup for him,

2575
02:33:54.751 --> 02:33:57.640
it would be clover to Glenn.
I don't know how he's going to win.
Super.

2576
02:33:57.641 --> 02:34:01.510
That breaks my heart to say it.
Super impressive.
Glover versus OSP super.

2577
02:34:03.930 --> 02:34:06.880
He's a monster and a cut like relaxed.
Oh,
you're a,

2578
02:34:06.881 --> 02:34:09.840
you're an amazing athlete with those crazy kicks.
That's well the only,
the,

2579
02:34:09.910 --> 02:34:13.470
the not the only chance,
but a good chance that pat can mimic his,

2580
02:34:13.471 --> 02:34:14.880
when he fought filled Davidson Brazil.

2581
02:34:14.881 --> 02:34:17.100
But that was a globe who was kind of like all worn down.

2582
02:34:17.110 --> 02:34:19.330
It was like eating fucking just veggies or some shit.

2583
02:34:19.580 --> 02:34:22.120
He was coming off of that was,
he was only eating veggies.
I just made that up.

2584
02:34:22.121 --> 02:34:22.954
He looked like shit.

2585
02:34:24.220 --> 02:34:27.460
He was coming off the Jon Jones fight and he hurt his shoulder pretty bad in

2586
02:34:27.461 --> 02:34:30.670
that fight.
I don't know what he did to fix it.
He never went through Sir Surgery,

2587
02:34:30.700 --> 02:34:33.400
you didn't look good.
And we are filters hung on warm out.

2588
02:34:33.401 --> 02:34:37.300
So I mean pat could do that for sure.
But you know,
it was all the striking.

2589
02:34:37.360 --> 02:34:39.750
He was training for that fight in Connecticut and a garage.

2590
02:34:39.760 --> 02:34:41.110
Remember like by himself?
Yeah.

2591
02:34:41.111 --> 02:34:44.610
They have the countdown show cause he showed him riding a stationary bike.

2592
02:34:44.950 --> 02:34:47.710
Listen,
the Aba like 30 so that's it.

2593
02:34:48.060 --> 02:34:50.770
37 he's a glow over is not young.

2594
02:34:50.830 --> 02:34:54.550
He looks every bit of 45 this is not 37 from six years ago when you could do

2595
02:34:54.551 --> 02:34:58.270
stuff and get away with it.
Right.
This is a legit 37 and that's not good.

2596
02:34:58.300 --> 02:34:59.280
But turned him seven.

2597
02:34:59.470 --> 02:35:03.700
Every boxer that's ever been good ever except for George form has done at the

2598
02:35:03.701 --> 02:35:06.010
same guy and done damn box at Bernard Hopkins.

2599
02:35:06.160 --> 02:35:08.950
But we don't know what Bernard Hopkins is doing.
I,
as far as the growth,

2600
02:35:09.210 --> 02:35:11.920
people don't think he's ever taken something.
You're fucking crazy.

2601
02:35:11.950 --> 02:35:16.610
I'm 50 50 is 50 and he's still winning.
Who said Bernard Hopkins?

2602
02:35:16.611 --> 02:35:19.880
And by the way,
his body does look different.
That may does look different.

2603
02:35:19.881 --> 02:35:24.280
Maybe in many ways,
one of the greatest sporting feats we've seen period.

2604
02:35:24.340 --> 02:35:26.690
And he's,
you know,
what else is good too?
Um,

2605
02:35:27.130 --> 02:35:30.490
like he doesn't seem to be diminished as far as like the building announcer.

2606
02:35:31.240 --> 02:35:35.410
Not Bad dude.
Shame been hurt.
Remember that.
Hey,
it's very good for him.

2607
02:35:36.010 --> 02:35:40.480
For being 50.
Yeah.
Y'All.
Oh for a fighter.
He's never been here we go.

2608
02:35:40.570 --> 02:35:42.680
His career,
you'll go Max Holloway and all the Avera.

2609
02:35:42.910 --> 02:35:47.910
See I feel like all Avera is more technical standing up and I think he's way

2610
02:35:48.131 --> 02:35:51.970
better on the ground.
But I think Holloway is so damn scrappy.
Yeah,

2611
02:35:51.971 --> 02:35:55.150
he was so confident.
A so wild like right there.
I love that.

2612
02:35:55.151 --> 02:35:57.130
Right hook the body and was straight left afterwards.

2613
02:35:57.460 --> 02:36:01.960
I was just so impressed with the way he took it to cub cap,
move in,
warm out,

2614
02:36:01.961 --> 02:36:02.860
heard him a couple of times,

2615
02:36:02.861 --> 02:36:06.700
almost finished and once and then finished and shot going right to the body like

2616
02:36:06.701 --> 02:36:09.160
that.
Well,
he's an animal man.
Max Hall was a bad mother fucker.

2617
02:36:09.190 --> 02:36:13.900
And the other thing about Holloway is he's young,
like 23.

2618
02:36:13.901 --> 02:36:16.450
When you get a guy like that,
you're seeing them every six months.

2619
02:36:16.451 --> 02:36:19.040
You've seen a way better version of this defense and that defense.

2620
02:36:19.710 --> 02:36:22.870
You chant even judge him by who we used to be six months ago.

2621
02:36:23.140 --> 02:36:26.320
He's probably way better now.
I think Charles is more dangerous.

2622
02:36:26.321 --> 02:36:29.770
I just think Max has,
I think he puts it together better.

2623
02:36:29.920 --> 02:36:32.740
That's why I think Mexican when I think he just throws it all out there.

2624
02:36:32.741 --> 02:36:34.600
He's like,
I'm just going to put all my train together.

2625
02:36:34.601 --> 02:36:37.900
I'm going to throw everything at them right now.
I'm not wasting shots.

2626
02:36:37.901 --> 02:36:42.850
Caution PJ eyebrow flash.
They have a common opponent.
Cub,
Swanson,

2627
02:36:42.851 --> 02:36:47.240
a cub,
Swanson Lit Charles of on fire and Max Holloway.
Um,

2628
02:36:47.350 --> 02:36:49.200
or yeah.
Then it comes to loss of,

2629
02:36:49.210 --> 02:36:52.870
stopped him early in the first round and then of course Max Holloway just got

2630
02:36:52.900 --> 02:36:56.470
the biggest card,
some down.
What's wrong with cub when they fought,

2631
02:36:56.471 --> 02:36:57.670
they didn't get hurt in the first round,

2632
02:36:57.700 --> 02:37:01.450
so I'm not taking it to get away from Max.
But what happened?

2633
02:37:01.880 --> 02:37:06.690
Oh Shit.
Oh fuck.
Oh no way.

2634
02:37:06.700 --> 02:37:11.500
Really pay me by about a,
Oh wow,
whoa,
whoa,
Whoa,

2635
02:37:11.510 --> 02:37:14.710
Whoa,
whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.
What's going on here?
Located his shoulder.

2636
02:37:14.970 --> 02:37:15.803
Look at this college.

2637
02:37:17.420 --> 02:37:21.920
<v 1>I pulled away from him immediately.
Wow.</v>

2638
02:37:21.921 --> 02:37:24.740
Powerful Max Holloway.
It's too bad.
It would have been fun to see him go.
Yeah,

2639
02:37:24.741 --> 02:37:26.900
there was an,
it was shaping up to be an interesting fight,

2640
02:37:26.901 --> 02:37:31.460
but Holloway was teeing up on him already.
Damn.
I think I just lost 20 bucks.

2641
02:37:32.420 --> 02:37:37.130
Yeah,
man,
you did against me down 2000 would be lost to grant.

2642
02:37:37.200 --> 02:37:41.870
Got his collar bone.
It shattered.
Oh fuck.
Mans up bomber.

2643
02:37:41.871 --> 02:37:44.810
You don't want to see like that.
Like the God damn.

2644
02:37:44.811 --> 02:37:47.690
Can we get a replay or something?
Give us some volume.
Sun.

2645
02:37:48.260 --> 02:37:51.110
Give us some volume so we can hear and I just want the replay.

2646
02:37:51.320 --> 02:37:53.660
What they're saying,
why are his wings Tattoo differently?

2647
02:37:53.940 --> 02:37:57.760
Once a devil one's an angel,
Bro,
that's your words.

2648
02:37:57.761 --> 02:38:02.240
Go and just get me ready.
He just stopped and went,
I'm done.
Oh God.
Yeah.

2649
02:38:02.241 --> 02:38:03.950
Well he must,
he's a smart dude.

2650
02:38:04.310 --> 02:38:09.260
He must've known something was a cracked my check.
He says,
well,

2651
02:38:09.261 --> 02:38:12.230
you can't ask for a performance bonus for that.
I got an injury.

2652
02:38:12.650 --> 02:38:15.470
That's kind of silly.
It's a bomber.
Let's see what happened here.

2653
02:38:15.530 --> 02:38:20.240
Although it was interesting fight,
so he shoots eight hits.
The whole riffs.

2654
02:38:20.510 --> 02:38:24.900
Shoulder hurts right there.
Yeah.
Look,
look,
look,
look,
look,
look.
No,

2655
02:38:25.440 --> 02:38:30.020
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Let's do something else.

2656
02:38:30.021 --> 02:38:33.530
This was something else.
Oh No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
He gets up.
Yup.
Yup.
That's it.

2657
02:38:33.860 --> 02:38:38.180
That's it.
Hold a little bit.
No,
no,
no man.
It's Eddie.
It's off.

2658
02:38:38.181 --> 02:38:41.090
I'm not going to charge you that.
I'm not gonna charge you two.
Let's,
Oh,

2659
02:38:41.091 --> 02:38:42.500
you're a beautiful person.
Look at this.

2660
02:38:43.070 --> 02:38:47.790
He's am shooting for the tape shooting for the tape.
I would think he think he,

2661
02:38:48.600 --> 02:38:52.200
he,
he broke it something and then he didn't really feel the extent of it.

2662
02:38:52.330 --> 02:38:54.200
It splits be quiet.
Let's give us some volume.

2663
02:38:54.201 --> 02:38:59.140
Maybe we can hear Jamie give us more volume.
Wow.
He's,

2664
02:38:59.150 --> 02:38:59.511
hold on one.

2665
02:38:59.511 --> 02:39:03.790
I'll take whatever bet you you make the next bet and how it will be doubling up

2666
02:39:03.810 --> 02:39:07.820
and Molech.
Let's see what he said.
Well,
hits.
Hear what they're saying.
Main event.

2667
02:39:08.330 --> 02:39:09.163
Hold on.

2668
02:39:20.840 --> 02:39:24.110
He seems like he's grabbing his neck,
man.
It's like the collar bone thing though,

2669
02:39:24.111 --> 02:39:25.040
right?
I don't know.

2670
02:39:25.041 --> 02:39:27.800
It's fucked up that his nose started bleeding immediately when he did.

2671
02:39:27.801 --> 02:39:32.480
That shit doesn't look good guy.
That doesn't look like,
yeah,
no shit.

2672
02:39:32.510 --> 02:39:33.560
That was a neck thing.

2673
02:39:33.590 --> 02:39:36.800
It wasn't like it is call his boats kept going like this behind him.

2674
02:39:36.801 --> 02:39:38.840
Kept going like the carotid artery or something.

2675
02:39:39.530 --> 02:39:44.000
That's a bomber that doesn't count all bets off on that.
Well,

2676
02:39:44.001 --> 02:39:47.250
you're a beautiful person because Eddie Bravo would a stuffed it.
Right

2677
02:39:48.950 --> 02:39:50.470
if he wants to do the same thing.

2678
02:39:53.300 --> 02:39:55.820
That's not a real fight.
Well,
it was a real fight.
I'll tell you what.

2679
02:39:55.821 --> 02:39:59.510
I was super impressed with Holloway before that.
Before the ending,

2680
02:39:59.540 --> 02:40:02.990
he was really landing some nice shots stand up really well.

2681
02:40:03.590 --> 02:40:06.740
He's getting better.
He can be the champ.
We can be the chair.

2682
02:40:06.741 --> 02:40:11.300
Who didn't agree in that division?
Datsun Johnson.

2683
02:40:11.870 --> 02:40:16.530
Well we,
it has to be on a though.
Okay,
so we got up to him.

2684
02:40:16.620 --> 02:40:21.100
Okay.
Damn.
What a fucking is fucking collarbone fell off.

2685
02:40:21.590 --> 02:40:25.650
Well,
we hope that's what happened.
I'm,
I'm nervous that he was grabbing his neck.

2686
02:40:25.680 --> 02:40:29.790
Yeah,
I'm nervous that his next fucked up.
Is there any truth to that?

2687
02:40:29.791 --> 02:40:34.730
You can get hit in the neck.
They're like judo,
judo,
chop it up.
He saw it.

2688
02:40:34.980 --> 02:40:38.780
Man of mystery.
What do you mean?
Like he hits the neck and knocked out.
Oh,

2689
02:40:38.800 --> 02:40:43.640
was for sure kicks land the movies with the gun shot ganache.
Sure.

2690
02:40:43.650 --> 02:40:47.640
One of the most,
it's gotta be real apres talking about like the,
you know,

2691
02:40:47.670 --> 02:40:50.870
judo chop and hit them and they pass out.
Right.
Well apparently there.

2692
02:40:50.970 --> 02:40:52.190
What's that?
There's that,

2693
02:40:52.400 --> 02:40:56.010
there's that movie about that cold leader that was just came out and he killed

2694
02:40:56.011 --> 02:41:00.690
somebody with judo chops.
Apparently source the source family.
Really?

2695
02:41:00.710 --> 02:41:03.050
The guy from the source family?
Yeah.
I don't know what does,

2696
02:41:03.120 --> 02:41:06.690
he killed the guy with judo chops and then started a call with a bunch of hot

2697
02:41:06.840 --> 02:41:10.890
chicks who wore white.
You
there?

2698
02:41:11.430 --> 02:41:13.410
No traps in judo but,
but you know what I mean?

2699
02:41:13.411 --> 02:41:18.210
That we always see like the news in the newspaper clipping old an old judo.

2700
02:41:18.211 --> 02:41:21.060
There was Brian when I saw the Flintstones and they said,

2701
02:41:21.210 --> 02:41:25.950
Fred Flintstone said a judo.
Judo Chop comes from Austin Powers.
Judo.
No,
no,
no.

2702
02:41:25.960 --> 02:41:30.960
It has not come from [inaudible] decade.

2703
02:41:31.081 --> 02:41:34.520
It comes from Austin Powers is a thief.
He stole that shit from Fred Flintstone.

2704
02:41:35.130 --> 02:41:38.800
Source family judo chops right now.
All right,
perfect.
Judo.
Hey,

2705
02:41:38.820 --> 02:41:41.830
let's hear some volume gives me volume.
That's a bummer man.

2706
02:41:41.880 --> 02:41:46.300
Volume Bruce Buffer

2707
02:41:46.300 --> 02:41:48.250
<v 6>for the official decision was here.
The official</v>

2708
02:41:50.370 --> 02:41:54.920
set of Nipples on it at one 39 seconds on the very first round,

2709
02:41:55.460 --> 02:41:57.010
you're going to win by June.

2710
02:41:57.510 --> 02:42:00.120
<v 1>Oh,
come on.
Why are they calling it a Tko?</v>

2711
02:42:01.740 --> 02:42:06.600
That's ridiculous.
Why not medical stoppage?
Well,
do they revise that?

2712
02:42:06.630 --> 02:42:10.140
If they find out what happened to his neck or his collarbone or whatever,

2713
02:42:10.490 --> 02:42:14.220
you see what he says,
Hey,
you know,

2714
02:42:14.221 --> 02:42:16.770
I want to do like Bj and beat the champ.

2715
02:42:17.370 --> 02:42:20.190
When your thoughts on bringing it home in every way class,

2716
02:42:22.200 --> 02:42:23.033
boy,

2717
02:42:23.550 --> 02:42:24.383
<v 7>everybody.</v>

2718
02:42:27.410 --> 02:42:29.890
Is it part of the game and it's kind of sad to see

2719
02:42:32.700 --> 02:42:33.533
know.

2720
02:42:40.420 --> 02:42:44.700
<v 1>So what?
What?
What is going on with all Rivera?
We don't know what the hell.
Yeah,</v>

2721
02:42:44.710 --> 02:42:48.130
I'm trying to see it.
Fuck now that's scary.
Him saying that Kenny Florian,

2722
02:42:48.670 --> 02:42:49.930
Kenny flying says Charles.

2723
02:42:49.931 --> 02:42:54.490
Olivia hurt his neck when he went headfirst into the cage.
Wow.

2724
02:42:56.380 --> 02:42:58.450
For sure.
You Bet.
And I've stopped cause it was Stinger.

2725
02:42:59.080 --> 02:43:02.230
Lose my number if you stopped cause it's the right number.

2726
02:43:02.450 --> 02:43:05.530
He does she have your number.
First of all,
he doesn't even speak English.

2727
02:43:05.660 --> 02:43:08.830
Well you'd be surprised.
You'd be like,
you'd be Sabrina Shove,

2728
02:43:08.831 --> 02:43:12.520
you talk a lot of shits about Brazil and the Brazilian Internet.

2729
02:43:12.610 --> 02:43:15.330
They released all his information so everybody can hear you.

2730
02:43:15.340 --> 02:43:17.470
I get death threats from Brazil.
He's all the time.

2731
02:43:18.950 --> 02:43:20.860
One of the coolest moments was,
you know,

2732
02:43:20.861 --> 02:43:23.740
working for the UFC or running into these famous fighters all the time and would

2733
02:43:23.890 --> 02:43:25.120
Nogueira first came over.

2734
02:43:25.300 --> 02:43:30.130
We started talking and we exchanged numbers and I thought it was the crazy as

2735
02:43:30.131 --> 02:43:34.600
shit that I'm exchanging fucking Nogueira.
Yeah.

2736
02:43:34.720 --> 02:43:38.170
It was so weird.
We've never like exchange any text or anything after that.

2737
02:43:38.171 --> 02:43:40.790
It was kind of like this,
but it was,
it was really strange.

2738
02:43:40.791 --> 02:43:45.250
You know I said that Sam Stout retired.
Yeah.
[inaudible] his opponent.
The price.

2739
02:43:45.450 --> 02:43:50.110
[inaudible] opponent first UFC fight,
knocks out,
stamps out Sam's town and says,

2740
02:43:50.111 --> 02:43:54.430
I'm going hang on tight move.
Just wanted me to get there.
Not The gout bitches.

2741
02:43:54.700 --> 02:43:58.240
Save that head trauma folio Mama.
That's say that.

2742
02:43:58.241 --> 02:44:01.330
Hands out the old Mama on a bad idea.
It's a good tee shirt.

2743
02:44:02.850 --> 02:44:07.780
Head trauma for your Mama.
Let's see if the a g has a,
Oh,
here it is.

2744
02:44:07.810 --> 02:44:10.360
Here's the man and killed somebody with judo jobs.

2745
02:44:10.900 --> 02:44:13.060
Judo chops like Justin Wren.

2746
02:44:13.480 --> 02:44:17.710
He also calls himself father yoed Father Yod,
Holloway wins with the judo.

2747
02:44:17.711 --> 02:44:21.490
Chop her,
his wife and daughter to ride to Hollywood on a motorcycle.

2748
02:44:21.520 --> 02:44:24.940
Audition for the role of Tarzan.
Well,
yeah.

2749
02:44:24.941 --> 02:44:29.230
Well you may or may not kill someone with you to chest and shot him.

2750
02:44:29.231 --> 02:44:31.390
Killed a man.
Killed a man.

2751
02:44:31.420 --> 02:44:34.360
Definitive that the abandoned his daughter but then killed a man so well,

2752
02:44:34.390 --> 02:44:38.850
and I'll just infer Tarzan.
There's a lot of,
um,
look up my guy.

2753
02:44:38.950 --> 02:44:43.600
It seems like your life or Gen X.
I'm jealous.
Eugenics.

2754
02:44:47.200 --> 02:44:51.940
Eugenics,
1930s.
So someone who is on your side on my timeline,

2755
02:44:52.030 --> 02:44:55.300
is it really?
It's for also robbed 11 banks.
He robbed 11 bags.

2756
02:44:55.301 --> 02:44:58.540
He sounds like he's robbing back.
Started a call free though.

2757
02:44:58.580 --> 02:45:01.360
Still free and running is called three and run is called.
They made,
uh,

2758
02:45:01.390 --> 02:45:05.200
one of the doctrines was you had to smoke weed for exactly seven second polls

2759
02:45:05.201 --> 02:45:08.590
from the bank.
I was like in the commandments,
you gotta go

2760
02:45:10.240 --> 02:45:12.100
back and then they would do Cooney,
Eleni Yoga,

2761
02:45:12.101 --> 02:45:16.240
get high and then talking to other,
that's hilarious.
Anything that part.
Yeah,

2762
02:45:16.241 --> 02:45:20.080
we're,
we're trying to find out what happened to,
uh,
Charles all Avera,

2763
02:45:20.081 --> 02:45:24.360
but I'm scared,
man.
I don't like that.
I don't like that at all.
Where to start.

2764
02:45:24.430 --> 02:45:28.180
Because if you're all amped up with adrenaline and sweating and your neck gets

2765
02:45:28.181 --> 02:45:32.710
hurt that bad,
especially early on when you have the nerves.
Yeah.
Like you said,

2766
02:45:32.711 --> 02:45:35.140
all the Adrenalin,
paternal Varma was Michael Bisbing saying,

2767
02:45:35.141 --> 02:45:37.180
cause he had some significant neck problems.

2768
02:45:37.870 --> 02:45:41.520
<v 8>I call finally one and went down to one knee.
Well,</v>

2769
02:45:41.830 --> 02:45:44.820
you both had taken Max Holloway before and then might ask away.

2770
02:45:46.480 --> 02:45:47.313
<v 1>Whoa.</v>

2771
02:45:48.120 --> 02:45:52.260
<v 8>It only lasted a minute and a half,
four minute 40.
But what I saw looked fun.</v>

2772
02:45:52.370 --> 02:45:53.203
Thanks Holly.

2773
02:45:53.340 --> 02:45:56.790
<v 1>You Bet.
Dapper fucking Englishman.
Beautiful hair is a handsome guy.</v>

2774
02:45:57.620 --> 02:46:02.100
And then moving
all of the right eye.
It looks a little suspect.

2775
02:46:03.030 --> 02:46:06.320
Oh yeah.
He's got some serious problems with his high.
He's got oil in his eye.

2776
02:46:07.610 --> 02:46:11.480
He's like,
dude,
dude,
dude.
At least he didn't punch him in the face there,

2777
02:46:11.630 --> 02:46:15.260
but he did hit him.
They know he's going,
no,
no,
no,
I'm done.
I'm doing.
He's like,

2778
02:46:15.261 --> 02:46:19.070
oh wait,
here's what for your liver.
Not done yet,
bitch.

2779
02:46:19.580 --> 02:46:23.510
So they sent me this thing for Eddie and they go between 35 and 76.

2780
02:46:23.511 --> 02:46:28.070
No fewer than 60,000 young Swedish women deemed mentally defective or otherwise

2781
02:46:28.071 --> 02:46:29.030
handicapped to a degree,

2782
02:46:29.120 --> 02:46:33.250
which makes them quote and capable of looking after their children or
sterilized.

2783
02:46:33.440 --> 02:46:38.090
Well,
that's not quite the same as looking back,
but continue.
They were ugly.

2784
02:46:38.120 --> 02:46:42.480
They caught him out.
I'm on your side,
brother.
The Internet's with you.

2785
02:46:42.590 --> 02:46:44.080
The Internet,
the Internet with the Internet.

2786
02:46:44.081 --> 02:46:46.790
And he never judged by the symmetry of their face.

2787
02:46:46.850 --> 02:46:50.450
The Internet may side like they thought that the symmetry of facing determined

2788
02:46:50.451 --> 02:46:54.300
how uh,
how um,
is that what it says online?
Are you just guessing?

2789
02:46:56.980 --> 02:47:01.980
I'm just guessing he did study faces to see if they had any correlation to

2790
02:47:02.230 --> 02:47:06.400
exactly criminal behavior.
That was brain.
No,
like skulls.
Right.
For Knowledge.

2791
02:47:06.401 --> 02:47:09.200
And of course that turned out,
I found out people are committing crimes.

2792
02:47:09.840 --> 02:47:12.050
If there's a way you could look at if someone's face and sad,

2793
02:47:12.051 --> 02:47:15.180
there are criminal of course there's no science to it at all.
Yeah,
of course.

2794
02:47:15.310 --> 02:47:17.260
Quite of course.
But they did it into that shit.

2795
02:47:18.450 --> 02:47:20.900
Actually a consent Sweden's for a while in Sweden,

2796
02:47:21.110 --> 02:47:23.890
I think it was actually in the United States,
but are light again,

2797
02:47:23.891 --> 02:47:28.040
is that main event Barmini out man,
they did that main event bum me out

2798
02:47:29.570 --> 02:47:33.680
well was that,
it bums me out because I'm worried about that dude's neck.
That's,

2799
02:47:33.700 --> 02:47:35.390
that's a real unusual man.

2800
02:47:35.450 --> 02:47:39.140
Joe Riggs was the last time that happened when Joe went down from that takedown.

2801
02:47:39.350 --> 02:47:42.830
But Joe so battered and beat up,
I just figured like,
yeah,

2802
02:47:42.831 --> 02:47:47.300
it was probably an old injury.
You got Charles says young man.
Yeah man.

2803
02:47:47.330 --> 02:47:49.100
Well we don't know.
We never know

2804
02:47:54.020 --> 02:47:57.200
you got out of this one.
Eddie.
I'll give you that.
My man.
Hey.

2805
02:47:57.410 --> 02:47:59.630
Well he got out because you let them out.
Yeah,

2806
02:47:59.690 --> 02:48:03.830
I'll pay you if you want me to know.
I don't want that tainted money.

2807
02:48:05.450 --> 02:48:09.560
Okay,
next by conveying and you pick the main event,
I'll pick if it's close.

2808
02:48:09.561 --> 02:48:12.680
If it's like Rhonda versus Holley,
we can't,
I'll take,
I'll take Holly Holm.

2809
02:48:13.100 --> 02:48:16.430
There's no way he's going to do a fight companion for Ronda Rousey.
I can't.

2810
02:48:16.700 --> 02:48:19.040
I'll be there.
I'll be there for that one for sure.

2811
02:48:19.590 --> 02:48:23.210
Unless it's in Yugoslavia was just making it like an exaggeration.

2812
02:48:25.380 --> 02:48:29.120
They decided to do it and check.
What about Barnett?

2813
02:48:29.121 --> 02:48:32.190
Roy Nelson in Japan.
There's no way you're going to that.
No,

2814
02:48:32.320 --> 02:48:36.380
not that I might be on the road.
I don't know.
It's always tough.

2815
02:48:36.980 --> 02:48:38.180
That's the only thing I came to my mind.

2816
02:48:38.181 --> 02:48:40.490
It's tough to get a stars align every now and then,

2817
02:48:40.550 --> 02:48:44.800
but it's good in that every now and then.
Yeah,
these are good and people are gay.

2818
02:48:44.801 --> 02:48:49.070
You guys talk over each other and you shit on each other.
Yes,
that's what we do.

2819
02:48:49.730 --> 02:48:52.490
That's what friends do.
But it's amazing how controlled it is.

2820
02:48:52.491 --> 02:48:55.700
Even in this atmosphere.
Booze,
weed gets a little cold.
It's amazing.

2821
02:48:55.701 --> 02:48:57.770
It Brian counts still tries to give Jiu Jitsu invoice.

2822
02:48:59.560 --> 02:49:02.040
That was the first thing I say and put Johnny Buddy or Chan pushed down and

2823
02:49:03.200 --> 02:49:07.770
that's what he said.
What you need to do in front of

2824
02:49:09.270 --> 02:49:12.180
you were the most qualified talking about most handsome man now

2825
02:49:13.980 --> 02:49:17.040
in this room,
100% but I mean,

2826
02:49:17.300 --> 02:49:20.580
and we still really haven't gotten down to it because you've got to go look.

2827
02:49:20.581 --> 02:49:23.080
You've got to go your boy.
Also,

2828
02:49:23.950 --> 02:49:26.980
I think what you're going to need to do in order to really tighten it up,

2829
02:49:26.990 --> 02:49:31.290
I would literally out of time,
we're probably done right?
Yeah.
We're already done.

2830
02:49:31.530 --> 02:49:34.410
We're done.
This is at three hours.
Eddie Bravo on Twitter.

2831
02:49:34.560 --> 02:49:37.550
Aubrey Marcus on Twitter.
Brian Keaulana.
Why on Twitter Tatum?

2832
02:49:37.620 --> 02:49:41.640
Maximize on Tait Fletcher full back.
Come on back.
Come on.

2833
02:49:41.641 --> 02:49:43.780
Who's got Tatum is maximum c to double double,

2834
02:49:44.240 --> 02:49:45.810
but I don't ever look at that shit.
Yeah,

2835
02:49:45.811 --> 02:49:50.710
the one you should post like for tickets or be dead post shit and whatever you

2836
02:49:51.060 --> 02:49:56.060
went with Brendan Schaub in the motherfucking house fighter and the kid.

2837
02:49:57.090 --> 02:50:01.350
When are you gonna bring back any Bible radio?
That's a good question.
All right.

2838
02:50:01.570 --> 02:50:04.840
I like podcasts.
Podcasts on it.
Podcasts.

2839
02:50:04.870 --> 02:50:08.130
So warrior poet Park Project.
All right,
that's it.
Fuckers.

2840
02:50:08.160 --> 02:50:12.390
We'll be back soon and we're probably gonna do an audit one from Texas this
week.

2841
02:50:12.580 --> 02:50:16.440
I'll be,
and I are going to go slay pigs.
That's right.
Not Cops.
That's rude.

2842
02:50:16.441 --> 02:50:20.550
I don't call cops pigs,
but real wild pigs.
I'll vera his neck,
his brace,

2843
02:50:20.551 --> 02:50:23.850
and he's on a stretcher.
They taking out back way.
He still grabbing his neck.

2844
02:50:23.851 --> 02:50:28.560
Whoa.
Whoa.
Oh my God.
Fuck.

2845
02:50:28.650 --> 02:50:33.290
All right.
Well all of our hopes and wishes are for Oliveira,

2846
02:50:33.690 --> 02:50:37.410
you know,
send them some,
some low at socks.
Hi folks.

2847
02:50:37.411 --> 02:50:40.810
Thanks for tuning in and that's it.
We'll see you soon.
