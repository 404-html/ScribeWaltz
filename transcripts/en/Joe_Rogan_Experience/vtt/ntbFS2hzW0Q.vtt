Hey everybody,

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.130
this episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by legal

3
00:00:08.131 --> 00:00:08.964
zoom.

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.840
Legal Zoom is a way to handle all sorts of legal shit that you would have to

5
00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:17.400
actually go to a lawyer to lawyer to handle it online on your own with no

6
00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:18.234
clothes on.

7
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.300
And you can go to legal zoom.com and you can incorporate or form an LLC for as

8
00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:25.620
little as 99 bucks.

9
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.440
You could form a will for 69 bucks.

10
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.750
It's really easy to do.

11
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.680
And you,

12
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.630
if you panic and you're freaking out and you're like,

13
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:34.470
I think I'm gonna go to jail,

14
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.580
they will connect you with an independent attorney who can give you additional

15
00:00:38.581 --> 00:00:39.750
guidance independent.

16
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.980
It's not like one of their guys.

17
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.970
Um,

18
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.670
and legal zoom is not a law firm,

19
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.050
but they provide you self help services at your specific direction and it can

20
00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:51.000
save you a lot of time and a lot of money.

21
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.130
They've helped millions of people in America.

22
00:00:53.131 --> 00:00:53.521
In fact,

23
00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:55.590
over the last 12 years,

24
00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.150
2 million Americans have used legal zoom and they've saved a ton of money.

25
00:01:00.151 --> 00:01:02.340
It's a suite service.

26
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.360
It's way better and way more stress free than actually going to a lawyer.

27
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.070

stamps.com Code Word J.

56
00:02:20.931 --> 00:02:21.480
R e.

57
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.870
We're also brought to you by [inaudible] Dot Com that's o.N n.

58
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.310
I.

59
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.310
T.

60
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.311
A.

61
00:02:26.311 --> 00:02:27.870
If you haven't been there for awhile,

62
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.910
checkout some of the new things that we have,

63
00:02:29.911 --> 00:02:33.090
including the Zombie kettlebells and the primal bells.

64
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.340
There's four in a series of each one now,

65
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.851
uh,

66
00:02:35.851 --> 00:02:37.800
ranging from in the primal bells.

67
00:02:37.801 --> 00:02:42.540
We have little howler monkeys that are 18 pounds all the way up to gorillas,

68
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.070
which is 72 pounds.

69
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.120
Um,

70
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.380
I always emphasize,

71
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.651
I mean,

72
00:02:46.651 --> 00:02:47.310
if you're in a room,

73
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.380
if you think they're cool and you just want to have more on your house,

74
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:50.521
that's one thing.

75
00:02:50.521 --> 00:02:52.230
But if you actually going to work out with them,

76
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.300
if you can hire a trainer,

77
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.040
just hire just for maybe one time,

78
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.080
see if he'll let you like film them on a,

79
00:02:58.081 --> 00:03:02.170
on an iPhone and just get the technique right and don't start with a really

80
00:03:02.171 --> 00:03:02.680
heavyweight.

81
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.500
Don't try to go match all you'll hurt yourself and it's such a stupid way to

82
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:06.334
hurt yourself.

83
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.050
You could get a serious legit workout with like 35 pounds and I know you like

84
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:11.291
Joe.

85
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:12.670
I'm way more manly than that.

86
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.170
I know you are.

87
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.920
I know you are.

88
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.753
I am too,

89
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.970
but yet I can get an awesome workout in with 35 pounds.

90
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.421
You'd be,

91
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:22.870
you'd be seriously impressed and you're way better off going light and doing it

92
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:23.590
correctly.

93
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.090
We sell DVDs on them like the Keith Weber Kettle Bell Cardio extreme,

94
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.250
a workout DVDs one and two.

95
00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:31.090
They're fantastic.

96
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:32.050
It's a great thing to do.

97
00:03:32.051 --> 00:03:33.250
You just do what he does,

98
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.941
like just,

99
00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:34.391
he said,

100
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:34.781
ready,

101
00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:35.111
go.

102
00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:36.130
And he does it with you.

103
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.580
So it's like it,

104
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.810
it forces you to do some shit that you would ordinarily,

105
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:41.560
you would stop,

106
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.220
you would quit.

107
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.050
You'd take a breather but he's not breathing so you're not going to either your,

108
00:03:46.051 --> 00:03:47.170
you're going to go through with it.

109
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.401
There's a bunch of them.

110
00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:49.870
We have a bunch of packages for sale.

111
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.680
Um,

112
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.370
there's,

113
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.150
there's the two extreme kettlebell cardio DVDs from Keith Webber,

114
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.871
but uh,

115
00:03:55.871 --> 00:03:59.650
we also have some instructionals on how to work out with club bells,

116
00:03:59.651 --> 00:04:00.790
which we also sell.

117
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.170
What we're trying to do is sell all things that work for what you would call

118
00:04:05.171 --> 00:04:06.520
functional strength.

119
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.030
Like there's a lot of exercises that people do at the gym that they don't really

120
00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:12.730
enhance her athleticism or functional strength,

121
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.710
meaning they don't really translate into sports.

122
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.270
They just make your biceps bigger.

123
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.680
And if that's all you want to do,

124
00:04:17.681 --> 00:04:18.514
that's fine,

125
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.110
but this can do that as well.

126
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.550
And it will really translate into a actual physical performance.

127
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.270
Uh,

128
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.630
we have tons of supplements and if you use a code name Rogan,

129
00:04:27.631 --> 00:04:30.490
you will save 10% off any and all supplements.

130
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.121
All right,

131
00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:31.990
that's on a.com.

132
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.090
O.

133
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.090
N.

134
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.090
N.

135
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.090
I.

136
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.090
T.

137
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.760
Anna's here.

138
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.710
We get the party started.

139
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.350
All right.

140
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.183
If the music,

141
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.610
<v 1>the Joe Rogan experience,</v>

142
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.800
try by day Joe Rogan podcast,

143
00:04:47.801 --> 00:04:49.250

144
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:51.573
Thank you for joining us.

145
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.110
Thank you for having me.

146
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.323
Very excited.

147
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.920
Kasparian yes.

148
00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.620
<v 0>Can announce it from the young Turks,</v>

149
00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.850
which is,

150
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.140
you guys are like the new media,

151
00:05:00.141 --> 00:05:00.411
right?

152
00:05:00.411 --> 00:05:02.780
And this is like old media and there's new meats.

153
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:03.231
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

154
00:05:03.231 --> 00:05:04.190
Establishment media,

155
00:05:04.191 --> 00:05:04.701
new media.

156
00:05:04.701 --> 00:05:06.890
I'm actually working on a book about it.

157
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.940
Um,

158
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.990
I mean I'm not 100% sure that it's going to be published,

159
00:05:11.991 --> 00:05:13.790
so I don't want to give too many details.

160
00:05:13.791 --> 00:05:13.941
It's,

161
00:05:13.941 --> 00:05:15.680
it's worth something I'm working on now.

162
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.370
Um,

163
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.110
but I got to experience that transition from establishment media to new media

164
00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.790
and there are really important differences and just this whole media revolution

165
00:05:25.791 --> 00:05:26.331
that's happening,

166
00:05:26.331 --> 00:05:29.510
that's really exciting for anyone who's interested in journalism.

167
00:05:29.511 --> 00:05:30.321
And I mean,

168
00:05:30.321 --> 00:05:32.240
you're part of it with this podcast,

169
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.433
allegedly,

170
00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:34.100
you are,

171
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.030
you are allegedly,

172
00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:37.071
and it's a,

173
00:05:37.071 --> 00:05:37.341
it's a,

174
00:05:37.341 --> 00:05:42.341
it's a really great way for people who want to be heard without being censored.

175
00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:45.310
You know,

176
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.730
I can basically say anything I want on March my show without worrying about

177
00:05:49.731 --> 00:05:50.511
anyone telling me,

178
00:05:50.511 --> 00:05:50.721
hey,

179
00:05:50.721 --> 00:05:51.560
you can't say this,

180
00:05:51.561 --> 00:05:52.394
you can't say that.

181
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.050
We have corporate sponsors.

182
00:05:54.051 --> 00:05:55.730
We got to make sure the advertisers,

183
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.271
you know,

184
00:05:56.271 --> 00:05:57.104
continue giving us

185
00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.940
<v 0>what's fascinating is all you have to do is be interesting,</v>

186
00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.781
entertaining,

187
00:06:01.781 --> 00:06:02.614
informative,

188
00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:03.520
and that's it.

189
00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.270
It doesn't have to have CNN on it or Fox on it or any of these other names that

190
00:06:07.271 --> 00:06:08.051
we've attributed.

191
00:06:08.051 --> 00:06:09.640
So like meaning what the news is,

192
00:06:09.641 --> 00:06:10.720
where the news comes from.

193
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:11.440
<v 2>Definitely.</v>

194
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.711
I mean,

195
00:06:11.711 --> 00:06:13.630
when I first started working at Tyt,

196
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.700
it was this unknown show.

197
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.560
It had been around for a few years,

198
00:06:17.561 --> 00:06:18.040
um,

199
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.000
but it was a really big risk for me to work there because I was working at CBS

200
00:06:22.001 --> 00:06:25.900
radio at the time and CBS radio had like a very clear path for me.

201
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.550
You start off as an assistant producer,

202
00:06:27.551 --> 00:06:27.971
your work,

203
00:06:27.971 --> 00:06:31.120
you will work your way up and if you're good enough and persistent enough,

204
00:06:31.121 --> 00:06:32.470
you'll be an anchor and you'll be fine.

205
00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.800
You know,

206
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.820
you'll be set for life.

207
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:34.720
Um,

208
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.800
with TYT,

209
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.040
it was just this huge risk because it was unknown.

210
00:06:39.041 --> 00:06:42.550
I didn't know if it would survive at the time it was on this radio station

211
00:06:42.551 --> 00:06:43.570
called Air America.

212
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.471
I don't know if you heard of it.

213
00:06:44.471 --> 00:06:44.651
Yeah,

214
00:06:44.651 --> 00:06:45.280
I remember that.

215
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.541
Yeah.

216
00:06:45.541 --> 00:06:47.560
The folks at t y t stands for the young Turks.

217
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.790
Yeah.

218
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:48.430
The young Turks.

219
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.110
You're on a plane with no Google and you're like,

220
00:06:50.111 --> 00:06:51.010
what the fuck is?

221
00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:53.320
Um,

222
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.670
so I just remember being really unhappy at CBS feeling like,

223
00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:58.180
you know,

224
00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.740
even if I get to the top of the ladder within this company,

225
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.950
I'm not going to feel fulfilled doing what they're doing.

226
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:06.760
Um,

227
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.160
and the first day I worked at the young Turks,

228
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:09.760
um,

229
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.570
I heard Janky Yeager,

230
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.470
the main hosts of the show go on this rant against the Bush administration and

231
00:07:14.471 --> 00:07:16.150
some of the ridiculous,

232
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:16.721
you know,

233
00:07:16.721 --> 00:07:18.630
civil liberty violations,

234
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.600
a civil liberties violations that they were accused of guilty of,

235
00:07:22.601 --> 00:07:22.900
not,

236
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:23.890
not even accused of.

237
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.521
And I was like,

238
00:07:24.521 --> 00:07:24.971
wow,

239
00:07:24.971 --> 00:07:26.920
you do not see this in the media.

240
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.050
You don't see this type of honesty.

241
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.320
You don't see people go off like that.

242
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:34.150
They're usually very senatorial.

243
00:07:34.151 --> 00:07:36.190
Whenever they're doing any type of commentary.

244
00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:37.360
And I was tired of it.

245
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.490
I wanted some real news coverage.

246
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.040
So that's why I made the decision that I made and I,

247
00:07:42.041 --> 00:07:46.610
and I left and thank God I made that decision cause TYT actually succeeded in

248
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:47.493
big ways.

249
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.370
<v 0>In what year do you think it was where you know,</v>

250
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.980
it started to shift because it seems like to me it's uh,

251
00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:55.781
maybe three,

252
00:07:55.781 --> 00:07:56.261
five,

253
00:07:56.261 --> 00:07:57.160
whatever years it is.

254
00:07:57.161 --> 00:07:59.290
But within the last few years,

255
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:03.520
there's this shift where my friends don't ever talk to me about what they saw on

256
00:08:03.521 --> 00:08:04.090
CNN.

257
00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:06.190
They don't want to talk to me what they saw on Fox News.

258
00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:06.971
It's always,

259
00:08:06.971 --> 00:08:08.350
I read this online,

260
00:08:08.351 --> 00:08:09.700
I watch this online,

261
00:08:09.701 --> 00:08:10.900
I saw the young Turks,

262
00:08:10.901 --> 00:08:11.860
I'd watched this show,

263
00:08:11.861 --> 00:08:14.470
I watched this guy's podcast and this guy said,

264
00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:16.510
I mean everybody that I talked to is,

265
00:08:16.511 --> 00:08:19.090
is talking about stuff that they're getting when they're talking about real

266
00:08:19.091 --> 00:08:19.491
issues.

267
00:08:19.491 --> 00:08:21.160
There's talking about stuff they're getting online.

268
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:21.591
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

269
00:08:21.591 --> 00:08:23.450
well a lot of things have changed.

270
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:27.200
People don't rush home to watch a newscast anymore.

271
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:31.850
And people also know that there are corporate interests involved in traditional

272
00:08:31.851 --> 00:08:32.570
media.

273
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:32.781
You know,

274
00:08:32.781 --> 00:08:36.740
you see advertisements for things that you can't even buy on traditional media.

275
00:08:36.741 --> 00:08:40.550
Like I see advertisements for this company called Siemens and I'm like,

276
00:08:40.551 --> 00:08:41.810
what are they trying to sell me?

277
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.410
And you realize that they're not trying to sell the consumer anything.

278
00:08:45.411 --> 00:08:47.780
It's a form of control over the network.

279
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:52.850
BP has a bunch of advertisements on mainstream media and if they are the people

280
00:08:52.851 --> 00:08:54.080
that are paying your bills,

281
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:58.170
you are less to be critical of their business practices.

282
00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.580
So with,

283
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.250
with traditional media you have that issue.

284
00:09:02.251 --> 00:09:04.410
And I think people are now more and more aware of it.

285
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:06.720
And with online media it's on demand.

286
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:07.291
Okay.

287
00:09:07.291 --> 00:09:08.124
It's raw.

288
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:08.581
We,

289
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:12.390
cause we say whatever the hell we want without worrying about censorship and

290
00:09:12.391 --> 00:09:13.224
people like that.

291
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.030
There's something really refreshing about it.

292
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:15.510
You know,

293
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:18.750
they didn't have it before and they didn't think they could and they thought if

294
00:09:18.751 --> 00:09:21.820
they did it probably would come in and uneducated form exactly.

295
00:09:21.821 --> 00:09:24.810
Be Some idiots or saying stupid things that don't even ring true.

296
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:26.970
But instead there's intelligent people and they're like,

297
00:09:26.971 --> 00:09:27.870
fuck this.

298
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:28.471
And you're like,

299
00:09:28.471 --> 00:09:28.950
Whoa,

300
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:29.511
hold on.

301
00:09:29.511 --> 00:09:29.910
Yeah.

302
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:31.440
Like these people are actually articulate.

303
00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:33.090
They look like they went to school.

304
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:33.871
Like this is,

305
00:09:33.871 --> 00:09:34.560
this is,

306
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.011
you know,

307
00:09:35.011 --> 00:09:35.880
and this is a new thing.

308
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:39.870
I actually think that it's a perfect example of the free market deciding because

309
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.960
I don't think that the American people are stupid.

310
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:44.370
I think that they can detect,

311
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.880
decide and determine whether or not someone is intelligent enough or credible

312
00:09:47.881 --> 00:09:49.560
enough to cover a particular story.

313
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.860
So a perfect example of that is I'm not a science reporter.

314
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.470
So whenever I attempt to cover science news,

315
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:55.771
uh,

316
00:09:55.771 --> 00:09:58.920
the audience tears me apart for it as they should because that's not my

317
00:09:58.921 --> 00:09:59.754
expertise.

318
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.040
My expertise is political commentary,

319
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:02.431
um,

320
00:10:02.431 --> 00:10:03.600
social commentary.

321
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.050
And that's usually the stuff that does really well on the young Turks when I

322
00:10:07.051 --> 00:10:07.710
cover it.

323
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:08.011
Um,

324
00:10:08.011 --> 00:10:11.400
and so the audience decides and they will let you know.

325
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:12.900
With mainstream media,

326
00:10:12.901 --> 00:10:15.630
it's really difficult for you to voice your opinion if you don't like the

327
00:10:15.631 --> 00:10:16.141
coverage.

328
00:10:16.141 --> 00:10:16.351
Right?

329
00:10:16.351 --> 00:10:17.250
You might write an email,

330
00:10:17.251 --> 00:10:19.170
but you don't know if anyone's ever going to see it.

331
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:20.820
With our show,

332
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:21.720
we're on youtube,

333
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.310
we get constant,

334
00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:27.420
constant feedback and a lot of times it's not construct

335
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:28.180
<v 3>diff,</v>

336
00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:28.620
uh,

337
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:28.900
but,

338
00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.610
but sometimes it is constructed

339
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:37.910
<v 2>be the lowest form of human on the planet is the Youtube commentor pretty</v>

340
00:10:37.911 --> 00:10:39.050
hideous people on there.

341
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:41.540
If you looked at it like per numbers,

342
00:10:41.541 --> 00:10:42.500
like per capita,

343
00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.020
it's got a lovely 40% assets.

344
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:45.411
Okay.

345
00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:48.110
So let me give you an example of something that enraged me the other day.

346
00:10:48.111 --> 00:10:51.140
I literally lost it in our studio and everyone's like,

347
00:10:51.141 --> 00:10:51.974
you need to calm down.

348
00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:56.270
We covered this story about this guy in Massachusetts who was going around

349
00:10:56.271 --> 00:10:58.370
taking up skirt pictures with his cell phone.

350
00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.120
Okay?

351
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:03.050
So cops finally caught him back in 2010 and now he's going to stand trial for it

352
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:08.270
and he's actually suing the government because he feels that his first amendment

353
00:11:08.271 --> 00:11:12.380
rights have been violated and his female lawyer is arguing that since these

354
00:11:12.381 --> 00:11:14.480
women are in a public place,

355
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.730
they have no reasonable expectation of privacy.

356
00:11:16.731 --> 00:11:19.370
Therefore he should be allowed to take up skirt pictures of them.

357
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:20.990
How absurd is that argument?

358
00:11:20.991 --> 00:11:21.201
Anyway,

359
00:11:21.201 --> 00:11:22.430
we covered on the show.

360
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:27.380
We share our opinion on it and I would say like about one third of the audience

361
00:11:27.381 --> 00:11:28.010
was like,

362
00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:28.401
<v 3>yeah,</v>

363
00:11:28.401 --> 00:11:29.210
they're right.

364
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:29.571
Yeah.

365
00:11:29.571 --> 00:11:30.890
And as a dumb bitch what is,

366
00:11:30.891 --> 00:11:33.680
she doesn't know anything first amendment rights and it's like Ah,

367
00:11:33.681 --> 00:11:36.520
what am I supposed to do with these types of situations?

368
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.560
<v 2>It's really frustrating.</v>

369
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.680
That's in those women who are lawyers or gangster.

370
00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:41.720
<v 3>Listen,</v>

371
00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.190
that's some gangster shit right there.

372
00:11:43.191 --> 00:11:45.230
She just likes the trader Shit right there.

373
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:45.930
Yeah,

374
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:46.250
I would,

375
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:50.060
I'd be very curious to see if she would be okay with this dude with her own

376
00:11:50.061 --> 00:11:52.730
client taking up skirt pictures with her or have her.

377
00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:53.400
Um,

378
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.240
and another argument she made was what,

379
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:55.571
I mean,

380
00:11:55.571 --> 00:11:56.950
all these women were wearing underwear.

381
00:11:56.951 --> 00:11:59.080
We didn't see their badge so it's okay.

382
00:11:59.110 --> 00:11:59.943
Wow.

383
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.660
<v 0>That's very gangster of her.</v>

384
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.340
Yeah,

385
00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:05.250
that's is that just what happens when you get into the business world?

386
00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:06.730
You get into the corporate world and you,

387
00:12:06.731 --> 00:12:07.001
you know,

388
00:12:07.001 --> 00:12:08.400
you become a lawyer and you're just,

389
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:13.000
it's about winning and losing and definitely on the client and just argue it

390
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:15.700
even though your sold your own vagina.

391
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.120
<v 3>I know.</v>

392
00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.270
Hold her own vagina.

393
00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:20.500
I don't know what she looks like,

394
00:12:20.501 --> 00:12:21.820
but maybe she has nothing to worry about.

395
00:12:21.821 --> 00:12:23.710
Maybe no one wants to get an obscured picture of her.

396
00:12:23.711 --> 00:12:26.950
And that's why she has no problem making these arguments in court.

397
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:31.690
Or maybe she's just dying for someone to get a picture of where maybe that could

398
00:12:31.691 --> 00:12:32.524
be it too.

399
00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.393
Definitely.

400
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:33.761
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

401
00:12:33.761 --> 00:12:38.080
it's so that's a fucking big leap that those women lawyers made.

402
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:40.450
They just decided it's fucking straight to hell.

403
00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.180
<v 3>I was really surprised by that.</v>

404
00:12:42.181 --> 00:12:42.720
But you know,

405
00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.350
look,

406
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:44.180
when you have,

407
00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:44.640
um,

408
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.350
there's like financial gain involved,

409
00:12:46.351 --> 00:12:46.891
then okay,

410
00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:49.260
I guess I can kind of understand where you're coming from,

411
00:12:49.261 --> 00:12:51.990
your lawyer and you're trying to make some money I guess.

412
00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.790
And it's really difficult for lawyers right now to even get cases to get work.

413
00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.740
So maybe that plays a role in it.

414
00:12:58.741 --> 00:13:02.490
But what really bothered me about it is we have a progressive audience.

415
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:05.220
Like our audience is pretty liberal.

416
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:10.250
So whenever I see that kind of responds to a story like that,

417
00:13:10.411 --> 00:13:11.340
I'm always shocked.

418
00:13:11.341 --> 00:13:11.581
I'm like,

419
00:13:11.581 --> 00:13:11.910
wait,

420
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:13.410
you guys are okay with this?

421
00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:14.920
<v 0>It's just men,</v>

422
00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:19.120
men who are most men who are raised by shitheads.

423
00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:20.463
That's a lot of it.

424
00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:21.610
It's a big part of it.

425
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:25.130
The real problem is they don't even realize they're being shitheads cause their

426
00:13:25.131 --> 00:13:26.020
dad was a shithead.

427
00:13:26.021 --> 00:13:27.010
Their brothers or Shithead,

428
00:13:27.011 --> 00:13:28.570
they grow up in a community of shitheads.

429
00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:29.920
They don't even realize it.

430
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:30.820
It's just,

431
00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.320
it's just a behavior.

432
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:35.730
<v 3>And there's also a possibility that they're just straight out trolling.</v>

433
00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.590
Like they don't even believe what they're saying,

434
00:13:37.591 --> 00:13:39.780
but they're doing it to get a response like this.

435
00:13:39.781 --> 00:13:40.870
I just think just one,

436
00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:43.320
they just one and I'm totally aware of that,

437
00:13:43.321 --> 00:13:44.160
but I just,

438
00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:44.820
yeah.

439
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:45.690
And I remember,

440
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.040
I remember being in the studio,

441
00:13:47.041 --> 00:13:48.450
like reading the comments and I was like,

442
00:13:48.451 --> 00:13:49.590
what the fuck?

443
00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:50.461
Why?

444
00:13:50.461 --> 00:13:52.080
What am I doing with my life?

445
00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:52.980
Does it matter?

446
00:13:52.981 --> 00:13:53.520
Does it,

447
00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:53.851
you know?

448
00:13:53.851 --> 00:13:55.650
And I started feeling really bad about it,

449
00:13:55.651 --> 00:13:56.484
but then I was like,

450
00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:58.080
you just can't let that stuff get to you.

451
00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:59.430
You gotta take it with a grain of salt.

452
00:13:59.560 --> 00:13:59.951
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

453
00:13:59.951 --> 00:14:02.530
you can get caught up in an online troll war.

454
00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.780
You guys actually made fun of me,

455
00:14:04.781 --> 00:14:08.170
the young Turks tip because I got an online my space thing.

456
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.060
I don't even remember that a long time ago,

457
00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:11.470
but he was right.

458
00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:13.320
I would've made fun of me if I was making,

459
00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:13.810
I showed them,

460
00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:15.820
we had this interaction with this kid.

461
00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.040
This kid got kept harassing me over and over again.

462
00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.470
It was during the myspace days and you know,

463
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.570
no one knew like how to handle that yet.

464
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.460
It was like the new thing,

465
00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:28.390
if someone could just contact people and so some people would just contact

466
00:14:28.391 --> 00:14:29.050
people and go,

467
00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:30.550
why have you not killed yourself?

468
00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:31.151
You know,

469
00:14:31.151 --> 00:14:31.421
just,

470
00:14:31.421 --> 00:14:33.460
and you would get an email from someone saying,

471
00:14:33.461 --> 00:14:33.731
you know,

472
00:14:33.731 --> 00:14:34.630
you're horrible.

473
00:14:34.631 --> 00:14:35.021
You should,

474
00:14:35.021 --> 00:14:35.351
you know,

475
00:14:35.351 --> 00:14:36.820
you should eat glass,

476
00:14:36.821 --> 00:14:37.050
you know,

477
00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:37.660
whatever.

478
00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:39.010
You'd get like a lot of those in a day.

479
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.193
<v 3>The fuck.</v>

480
00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:41.760
Like this is weird.

481
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:42.780
This is a new thing.

482
00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:43.291
Interesting.

483
00:14:43.291 --> 00:14:44.124
I get um,

484
00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:45.690
Dick pics regularly,

485
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.230
really regularly geotag

486
00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:50.780
<v 0>them and you shouldn't put them re upload them online.</v>

487
00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.000
Let know where that sweet dick is

488
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:52.843
<v 4>high.</v>

489
00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:54.640
<v 2>I've considered that.</v>

490
00:14:54.641 --> 00:14:55.121
But you know,

491
00:14:55.121 --> 00:14:58.960
a lot of times they'll send me the pictures on Facebook because I have a fan

492
00:14:58.961 --> 00:15:03.550
page on Facebook and every once in a while check the messages and they're so

493
00:15:03.551 --> 00:15:07.270
stupid because all of their private information is on there.

494
00:15:07.271 --> 00:15:08.350
Like where they work,

495
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:12.940
who their girlfriend or their wife is and part of me wants to like forward it

496
00:15:12.941 --> 00:15:14.410
over to their girlfriend or wife,

497
00:15:14.411 --> 00:15:17.800
but I'm too nice like I don't want to like ruin their lives over there like

498
00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:18.910
perverted behavior.

499
00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:20.520
<v 4>Well that's very kind of you.</v>

500
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:21.260
Yeah,

501
00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:21.840
do that.

502
00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.440
Didn't the guy recently lose his job because they found out he was,

503
00:15:25.441 --> 00:15:25.710
yeah,

504
00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:30.570
he was a Reddit troll would do evil evil shit on reddit and some people said,

505
00:15:30.571 --> 00:15:30.750
all right,

506
00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:31.650
who is this guy?

507
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:32.850
And then they found,

508
00:15:32.851 --> 00:15:36.570
you know who this guy was and it was a character that he was playing like to

509
00:15:36.571 --> 00:15:37.530
blow off steam.

510
00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.120
He was allegedly,

511
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:42.060
he would just be like really evil and nasty online.

512
00:15:42.061 --> 00:15:42.260
Yes.

513
00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.560
<v 2>Small part of me felt kind of bad for him because he had a family to take care</v>

514
00:15:45.561 --> 00:15:50.561
of and you know it's going to like destroy his life and I get it online

515
00:15:50.781 --> 00:15:54.830
anonymity allows people to blow off steam in that way.

516
00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:57.710
And a lot of people right now because of the economic crisis,

517
00:15:57.711 --> 00:15:59.870
because of all the crap that's going on in the government,

518
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:03.200
all the death and destruction that's around us constantly.

519
00:16:03.201 --> 00:16:07.400
A lot of people need some sort of outlet and so they will use online anonymity

520
00:16:07.401 --> 00:16:08.091
to do that,

521
00:16:08.091 --> 00:16:11.150
to say hideous things to other people because that makes them feel good about

522
00:16:11.151 --> 00:16:11.984
themselves.

523
00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:15.500
And I think that if you're a mature adult you can just ignore them and step

524
00:16:15.501 --> 00:16:16.280
away.

525
00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.930
I'm not interested in censoring them.

526
00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.490
I know that youtube is trying to like,

527
00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.150
you know,

528
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:24.050
work with their comments so those negative comments get pushed back to the

529
00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.390
bottom or whatever and no one can read them.

530
00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:27.530
I just feel like,

531
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:28.483
you know,

532
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:32.660
the Internet should be an open forum for the most hateful people if they want to

533
00:16:32.661 --> 00:16:36.680
be hateful and we as adults have to have thicker skin.

534
00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:38.930
And just walk away and not let it get,

535
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:40.820
get to us and it's hard to do.

536
00:16:40.821 --> 00:16:41.660
It still gets to me.

537
00:16:41.661 --> 00:16:43.460
I mean that's what I opened the show with.

538
00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:44.410
<v 4>You know,</v>

539
00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:45.730
I like the way you two handles it.

540
00:16:45.731 --> 00:16:48.870
If too many people say this comments retarded than they,

541
00:16:48.871 --> 00:16:49.704
they eliminate it.

542
00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.450
But you can always see it if you wanted to like show the comment.

543
00:16:52.451 --> 00:16:52.750
Yeah,

544
00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:53.890
you could still show the comment.

545
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:57.050
<v 2>They're slowly getting rid of anonymity where they're,</v>

546
00:16:57.051 --> 00:16:57.381
you know,

547
00:16:57.381 --> 00:16:59.630
attaching the comments to a Google plus account.

548
00:16:59.631 --> 00:17:02.210
So it will be easier to identify who that person is.

549
00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:02.961
Um,

550
00:17:02.961 --> 00:17:04.640
I'm not necessarily against that.

551
00:17:04.641 --> 00:17:05.540
I just feel like,

552
00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:05.870
you know,

553
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:09.080
I don't want to move closer towards censorship online.

554
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:13.370
I love that it's an open forum even though there are negative aspects to it that

555
00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:14.540
impact my life.

556
00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:15.540
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

557
00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:15.781
no,

558
00:17:15.781 --> 00:17:16.471
I agree with you.

559
00:17:16.471 --> 00:17:17.370
I think it's a,

560
00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.810
it's an important like method of criticism that was never available before.

561
00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:26.340
We have a very honest view of like what you do and what people like,

562
00:17:26.341 --> 00:17:26.670
what you,

563
00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:27.271
when they like,

564
00:17:27.271 --> 00:17:28.170
what you do when they don't.

565
00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:33.440
And even if it's like really hyper critical overcritical if they have a point

566
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:37.660
like that point probably would have never gotten to you during any other era.

567
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:42.000
Like if you want to like really analyze what you're doing and try to figure out

568
00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:45.660
like what's the best way to hone this and they'll give you a lot of input.

569
00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:46.720
<v 2>They definitely will.</v>

570
00:17:46.721 --> 00:17:51.480
I will say that my political views have changed since I started working at TYT

571
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:53.940
and it's not necessarily because of my colleagues.

572
00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:54.240
Um,

573
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.550
it has a lot to do with audience feedback.

574
00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.081
For instance,

575
00:17:58.081 --> 00:18:00.870
you know what I thought about prostitution when I first started,

576
00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:03.030
it was very different from what I think now.

577
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:06.210
I was definitely against legalizing prostitution.

578
00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:10.680
I was in favor of tough on crime legislation when it came to dealing with that.

579
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.960
And then I realized like this is stupid.

580
00:18:12.961 --> 00:18:14.420
It's not keeping anyone safe.

581
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:14.790
Um,

582
00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:17.280
people were getting hurt as a result of,

583
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:18.183
you know,

584
00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.280
pushing this ban against prostitution.

585
00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.100
So I've changed my views on that.

586
00:18:23.101 --> 00:18:26.190
I think that we should legalize it and regulate it because that'll create a safe

587
00:18:26.191 --> 00:18:26.970
environment.

588
00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:28.590
And that's just one example of many

589
00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.880
<v 0>Willie d from the Geto boys said it best.</v>

590
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:32.890
He said you got to let a whole be a Ho.

591
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:34.201
<v 2>I mean,</v>

592
00:18:34.201 --> 00:18:37.290
if you have two consenting adults wanting to do that,

593
00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.430
exchanged money for sex,

594
00:18:38.431 --> 00:18:39.264
why the hell not?

595
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:43.770
It's amazing that we have like this huge porn industry in the country and as

596
00:18:43.771 --> 00:18:45.420
long as they do it in front of a camera,

597
00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:46.710
it's totally fine.

598
00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:48.660
But if they do it behind the scenes,

599
00:18:48.661 --> 00:18:49.494
it's illegal.

600
00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:49.901
<v 0>Well,</v>

601
00:18:49.901 --> 00:18:53.410
it's also weird that you can have sex with anybody you want for free and

602
00:18:53.411 --> 00:18:53.860
nothing.

603
00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.150
There's no crime committed at all.

604
00:18:55.151 --> 00:18:56.410
But if money's exchanged,

605
00:18:56.411 --> 00:18:58.540
somehow you become a criminal bullet parties.

606
00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.790
Does anyone really have sex for free though?

607
00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:01.720
When you really think about it?

608
00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.390
[inaudible] I didn't want to know this about you.

609
00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:06.821
I think a,

610
00:19:06.821 --> 00:19:07.420
yeah,

611
00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:08.230
this is people that,

612
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.651
yeah,

613
00:19:08.651 --> 00:19:10.150
there's people where it evens out.

614
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:12.490
Where it's free on both sides.

615
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:12.860
<v 2>No,</v>

616
00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:13.130
no,

617
00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:15.950
but what I mean by that is usually there's something else involved.

618
00:19:15.951 --> 00:19:16.940
I'm not talking about money,

619
00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:17.270
right?

620
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:18.320
But there are emotions involved.

621
00:19:18.321 --> 00:19:19.640
There's an exchange of emotions.

622
00:19:19.641 --> 00:19:21.440
There's an exchange of something

623
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:24.270
<v 0>need to get rid of fluids.</v>

624
00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:24.960
True.

625
00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:25.351
Yeah.

626
00:19:25.351 --> 00:19:25.740
Well,

627
00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:26.370
you know there's,

628
00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:31.370
there's obviously there's massive issues with men versus women as far as how the

629
00:19:31.851 --> 00:19:36.030
emotionally connect sex and and also the the need,

630
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:36.631
like what?

631
00:19:36.631 --> 00:19:40.140
I don't know what it's like to need Sachs as a woman and I'm sure it's a very

632
00:19:40.141 --> 00:19:42.860
specific itch whereas with a male I,

633
00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:46.710
I'm pretty sure after all my years of observing men and women in the difference,

634
00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:48.090
that is a different animal.

635
00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:53.190
I think the horniness for a man is very intoxicating and fogging and confusing

636
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:55.110
and I don't know if it is for women.

637
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.090
I think that's why like a lot of women,

638
00:19:57.091 --> 00:19:58.380
like a few cocktails first,

639
00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:02.120
they can light up the crazy furnace without

640
00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:02.710
<v 2>I think,</v>

641
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:03.850
I think the cocktails,

642
00:20:03.851 --> 00:20:06.850
I think men and women have similar sexual desires.

643
00:20:06.851 --> 00:20:07.630
However,

644
00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:12.490
women are not allowed to be as open about it because of societal expectations

645
00:20:12.491 --> 00:20:13.780
and certain gender roles.

646
00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:18.160
If you are a woman who is open about how much you love sex and how often you

647
00:20:18.161 --> 00:20:20.290
want to have sex and how badly you need it,

648
00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:22.060
you are looked at as a Ho.

649
00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.110
There's no question about it.

650
00:20:23.111 --> 00:20:25.510
People will refer to you as a loose woman,

651
00:20:25.511 --> 00:20:26.350
a slutty woman.

652
00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:29.230
That's the reason why a lot of women like to have the cocktails before they have

653
00:20:29.231 --> 00:20:32.710
sex because that'll allow them to let loose and do what they really want to do.

654
00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:33.610
Right.

655
00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:33.881
You know,

656
00:20:33.881 --> 00:20:35.440
without feeling guilty about it.

657
00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:36.071
Um,

658
00:20:36.071 --> 00:20:37.060
at least that's my,

659
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.691
my take.

660
00:20:37.691 --> 00:20:39.760
And then also if you don't have sex,

661
00:20:39.761 --> 00:20:42.940
if you decide to save yourself for marriage or are you safe,

662
00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:45.550
save yourself or someone that you genuinely love or whatever,

663
00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:46.930
then you're considered a prude.

664
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.340
There's really no winning.

665
00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:48.881
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

666
00:20:48.881 --> 00:20:52.750
Women have a total short anesthetic society and society wise when it comes to

667
00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:53.051
sex,

668
00:20:53.051 --> 00:20:53.884
without a doubt.

669
00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:57.340
But I think that if you wanted to say like who's going to think that you're a

670
00:20:57.341 --> 00:20:59.110
hoe for enjoying sex?

671
00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:00.550
While it's definitely going to be women,

672
00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.250
it's going to be a lot of women that think you're a Ho and it's definitely going

673
00:21:03.251 --> 00:21:04.870
to be guys who you won't have sex with.

674
00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:05.500
Right?

675
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:05.800
Right.

676
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.030
So what's left?

677
00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.940
The only left with like two groups of guys.

678
00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:14.470
There's guys that would have zero problem with it at all and then there's guys

679
00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:19.680
that would only have a problem with it if you weren't attracted to them.

680
00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:20.943
That's you know,

681
00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.650
and most likely see it weeds out assholes.

682
00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:26.020
So if you were a chick and you were just like,

683
00:21:26.021 --> 00:21:26.291
listen,

684
00:21:26.291 --> 00:21:26.920
I'm a freak.

685
00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.390
I like to get fucked all day long.

686
00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:29.283
That's what I'm into.

687
00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:32.050
You'll find exactly the right people that you need in your life.

688
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:34.450
That's an interesting perspective.

689
00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.210
I think girls won't want to have anything to do with you.

690
00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:36.621
<v 2>I know,</v>

691
00:21:36.621 --> 00:21:40.630
but you'll also attract a lot of really scary pervy people.

692
00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.830
<v 4>Oh no doubt.</v>

693
00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:42.520
Instantly.

694
00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.353
Instantly.

695
00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:44.243
Because I think,

696
00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.920
<v 2>I think for a lot of people,</v>

697
00:21:45.921 --> 00:21:47.690
especially in the culture we're living right now,

698
00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.300
if you're that open about your sexual desires,

699
00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:50.661
you know,

700
00:21:50.661 --> 00:21:54.260
people will see that as a green light to do things that might even be considered

701
00:21:54.261 --> 00:21:55.070
illegal,

702
00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:55.610
you know,

703
00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:58.370
whether it's harassment or sexual assault or something.

704
00:21:58.670 --> 00:21:59.330
<v 4>That's true.</v>

705
00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:00.163
And also,

706
00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.990
I mean this is like probably a bullshit,

707
00:22:02.991 --> 00:22:03.440
but I would,

708
00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.240
I would imagine that if,

709
00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:09.500
if you're the type of person it starts getting into like threesomes and tying

710
00:22:09.501 --> 00:22:10.200
each other up,

711
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.690
he started getting like really freaky.

712
00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:15.500
It's way easy to go too far with that.

713
00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:19.510
It's way like if you hear about someone like I'm just in a sax all day long,

714
00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:20.270
just love sex.

715
00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:23.600
Is it just sex or how long does it take for a ball gag comes out,

716
00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:24.410
you know,

717
00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:26.900
is it a month in your relationship?

718
00:22:26.901 --> 00:22:27.201
You know,

719
00:22:27.201 --> 00:22:28.160
like a year later,

720
00:22:28.161 --> 00:22:29.570
what are you going to be into a year from now?

721
00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:30.710
Just duct tape.

722
00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:33.890
Did I like ripping it off of her and let you know there's people that get in,

723
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.030
like how does that happen?

724
00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:39.380
They go down one of those pervy roads now you just got deep.

725
00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:40.010
Yeah,

726
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:43.090
go down [inaudible] road and you just can't get satisfied.

727
00:22:43.091 --> 00:22:47.930
It's like people have this weird thing of constantly want wanting progress.

728
00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:48.471
If they,

729
00:22:48.471 --> 00:22:50.810
if they have a house that's 4,000 square feet,

730
00:22:50.811 --> 00:22:51.291
they want a house,

731
00:22:51.291 --> 00:22:52.310
it's 5,000 square feet.

732
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:53.930
They make half a million dollars a year.

733
00:22:53.931 --> 00:22:54.980
They want to make $1 million a year.

734
00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:56.960
They always want to take things to the next level.

735
00:22:56.961 --> 00:22:58.550
And that includes like freaky shit.

736
00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:00.200
<v 2>Well that's the American way.</v>

737
00:23:00.201 --> 00:23:01.240
You always want more,

738
00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:01.491
more.

739
00:23:01.491 --> 00:23:02.720
You want the bigger TV.

740
00:23:02.721 --> 00:23:03.171
And even,

741
00:23:03.171 --> 00:23:05.510
I'm definitely guilty of that.

742
00:23:05.511 --> 00:23:05.751
You know,

743
00:23:05.751 --> 00:23:08.840
I live in a really modest apartment that I love,

744
00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:10.070
but the other day I was like,

745
00:23:10.071 --> 00:23:10.311
you know,

746
00:23:10.311 --> 00:23:11.960
I could probably go for a bigger apartment,

747
00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:14.030
but why I live by myself,

748
00:23:14.031 --> 00:23:14.870
my apartment's fine.

749
00:23:14.871 --> 00:23:15.651
I don't need a bigger one.

750
00:23:15.651 --> 00:23:16.230
Right.

751
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.520
Um,

752
00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.840
when it comes to,

753
00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:18.980
you know,

754
00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.060
physical stuff,

755
00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:22.730
I think you kind of just get desensitized by things.

756
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:23.361
You know,

757
00:23:23.361 --> 00:23:28.361
there have been many studies about what porn does to the brain and you start off

758
00:23:28.821 --> 00:23:31.880
by watching something that might be considered softcore and that's enough to,

759
00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:32.600
you know,

760
00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:33.433
do the job.

761
00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:34.101
Um,

762
00:23:34.101 --> 00:23:37.550
and then all of a sudden you're watching more and more hardcore stuff and you

763
00:23:37.551 --> 00:23:39.440
just become desensitized to it.

764
00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:42.560
And for a lot of teenage boys that grow up on that kind of stuff,

765
00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:44.180
that's what they expect from women,

766
00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:44.570
you know,

767
00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:45.140
are girls,

768
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:46.250
once they start having sex,

769
00:23:46.251 --> 00:23:47.540
it's really scary stuff.

770
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:49.830
<v 4>And there it's changing people.</v>

771
00:23:49.831 --> 00:23:51.270
Sexuality without a doubt though,

772
00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:52.490
the bushes gone.

773
00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:54.590
The Bush died because of porn.

774
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:56.240
I heard that you're upset about that.

775
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:57.103
I'm terrified

776
00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.340
they let porn when it doesn't make sense.

777
00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:06.290
It's like everybody let porn when before nobody had a problem until like 1990.

778
00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:06.560
Yeah.

779
00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.690
Nobody had a problem with a hairy vagina.

780
00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:10.160
It was just what it was.

781
00:24:10.161 --> 00:24:10.670
I mean,

782
00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:11.870
people trimmed around them,

783
00:24:11.871 --> 00:24:14.240
but generally there was a lot going on down there,

784
00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:16.370
especially if you dated an Italian girl,

785
00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:17.683
what have you.

786
00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:21.830
But now it's like their victory is just universal.

787
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:22.511
It's like the,

788
00:24:22.511 --> 00:24:24.260
the victory over that aesthetic.

789
00:24:24.261 --> 00:24:25.550
The victory over this shaved,

790
00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:26.050
yeah.

791
00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:27.600
Waxed the genitals.

792
00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:27.921
<v 2>Well,</v>

793
00:24:27.921 --> 00:24:31.220
those women are supposed to symbolize male desire.

794
00:24:31.221 --> 00:24:33.380
They're supposed to symbolize what a man wants,

795
00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:33.771
you know,

796
00:24:33.771 --> 00:24:37.310
and then that has an influence on regular women and they think,

797
00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:37.671
oh,

798
00:24:37.671 --> 00:24:38.960
am I supposed to look that way?

799
00:24:38.961 --> 00:24:40.520
Am I supposed to groom that way?

800
00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:41.340
Um,

801
00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:44.750
there have been stories of women that injure themselves because they'll go get

802
00:24:44.751 --> 00:24:46.880
bleached and areas that they shouldn't be getting bleached.

803
00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:50.960
And it's just amazing to me that it's that influential.

804
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:51.150
Okay.

805
00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:51.690
<v 4>I know.</v>

806
00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:52.530
It's very strange.

807
00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:52.730
It's,

808
00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:53.670
it's a silent,

809
00:24:53.671 --> 00:24:54.720
influential thing.

810
00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:55.440
It is.

811
00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.430
It's very odd.

812
00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:57.780
And I was when,

813
00:24:57.781 --> 00:25:01.860
when the markets are crashing and government bailouts were going down,

814
00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:02.640
um,

815
00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:03.480
I was fascinated.

816
00:25:03.481 --> 00:25:03.960
I was like,

817
00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.660
how come nobody ever wanted to bail out the porn industry?

818
00:25:06.661 --> 00:25:06.841
Like,

819
00:25:06.841 --> 00:25:11.190
why would they pretend that the porn industry isn't this giant monster business

820
00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.740
that all the sudden just evaporated?

821
00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.070
Like half of it,

822
00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:16.381
three quarters of it.

823
00:25:16.381 --> 00:25:18.330
I don't know what the number of it that just disappeared.

824
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:18.601
Yeah.

825
00:25:18.601 --> 00:25:19.434
Because of the Internet.

826
00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:19.701
Right.

827
00:25:19.701 --> 00:25:20.250
But so like,

828
00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:23.310
who's pretending that this isn't a real business?

829
00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:25.170
Like everyone's like flawless.

830
00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.080
I guess still just have to exist on their own.

831
00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:31.110
Meanwhile you're watching it like that person's a fan of it.

832
00:25:31.111 --> 00:25:34.230
He probably has like a bunch of different videos that he has like bookmarked on

833
00:25:34.231 --> 00:25:35.290
his laptop or something.

834
00:25:35.291 --> 00:25:35.410
Right?

835
00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:35.741
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

836
00:25:35.741 --> 00:25:36.191
definitely.

837
00:25:36.191 --> 00:25:37.060
But at the same time,

838
00:25:37.061 --> 00:25:39.610
which politician would come out and say,

839
00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:41.680
we need to bail out the porn industry.

840
00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:43.300
That would be political suicide.

841
00:25:43.301 --> 00:25:45.310
We live in this puritanical society.

842
00:25:45.311 --> 00:25:46.920
I mean that would be insane.

843
00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:51.510
<v 4>There's also the same sort of feeling that happened with the music business is</v>

844
00:25:51.511 --> 00:25:51.830
that,

845
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:52.191
you know,

846
00:25:52.191 --> 00:25:56.640
like the music business went out as well with the downloads of MP three s and

847
00:25:56.641 --> 00:25:57.474
file sharing.

848
00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:00.080
They lost a giant piece of revenue.

849
00:26:00.081 --> 00:26:03.840
I mean just evaporated and no one really was considering bailing them out

850
00:26:03.841 --> 00:26:04.111
either.

851
00:26:04.111 --> 00:26:04.944
It's like it was like,

852
00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:05.251
you know,

853
00:26:05.251 --> 00:26:06.420
you kind of should have figured this out.

854
00:26:06.421 --> 00:26:07.020
Dummies.

855
00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:07.290
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

856
00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:09.120
well I agree with you on that,

857
00:26:09.121 --> 00:26:10.260
but at the same time,

858
00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:14.370
everything always goes back to who is funding our politicians.

859
00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:14.881
You know,

860
00:26:14.881 --> 00:26:15.631
Wall Street,

861
00:26:15.631 --> 00:26:16.770
these big bankers,

862
00:26:16.771 --> 00:26:19.740
these are the people that fund the campaigns for our politicians,

863
00:26:19.741 --> 00:26:23.010
which is why they just willy nilly went for the bailout.

864
00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:24.180
Um,

865
00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.110
and by the way,

866
00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:26.640
after the bailout happened,

867
00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:30.120
we did nothing to break up these too big to fail banks.

868
00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:34.380
They still exist and they're still doing the same type of bullshit that'll lead

869
00:26:34.381 --> 00:26:36.000
to another economic collapse.

870
00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:36.511
I mean,

871
00:26:36.511 --> 00:26:38.940
the regulation that we passed was nothing.

872
00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:40.410
So it's just,

873
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:42.780
it always goes back to money in politics,

874
00:26:42.781 --> 00:26:46.230
which know we talk about on the show all the time.

875
00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:47.580
If someone is funding you,

876
00:26:47.581 --> 00:26:49.920
whether it's the media or whether you're a politician,

877
00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.570
you're not going to go against them.

878
00:26:51.571 --> 00:26:53.070
You're always going to bail them out.

879
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.731
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

880
00:26:53.731 --> 00:26:54.091
Turns,

881
00:26:54.091 --> 00:26:56.010
we kind of described it as a,

882
00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.120
he do.

883
00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:57.953
How would you describe it?

884
00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:59.640
He described it as a special interest.

885
00:26:59.641 --> 00:27:02.400
Oligarchy disguising itself as a democracy.

886
00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:03.031
Oh yeah.

887
00:27:03.031 --> 00:27:03.271
We,

888
00:27:03.271 --> 00:27:05.190
we have legalized bribery in this country.

889
00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:06.443
It's amazing,

890
00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:07.050
isn't it?

891
00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:07.291
I mean,

892
00:27:07.291 --> 00:27:09.390
when you really stop and think that that is,

893
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:14.280
it's gotten to the point that it is today where essentially it's open.

894
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:15.930
It's pretty obvious it's there.

895
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:19.320
They control virtually every single aspect of our economy,

896
00:27:19.321 --> 00:27:20.154
our society.

897
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:23.040
It's all just money generating hubs.

898
00:27:23.041 --> 00:27:27.750
These big giant spaceships filled with assholes that are just sucking money out

899
00:27:27.751 --> 00:27:28.160
of a,

900
00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.400
out of whatever,

901
00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:33.190
whether it's through oil or natural gas or whatever they're doing.

902
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.720
<v 2>Why do oil subsidies exist?</v>

903
00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:36.320
Like,

904
00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:36.860
good question.

905
00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.990
Why don't people ask the government that like,

906
00:27:38.991 --> 00:27:43.240
why the hell are we giving these massive profitable oil companies?

907
00:27:43.241 --> 00:27:44.074
Subsidies?

908
00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.710
It's insane.

909
00:27:45.711 --> 00:27:46.401
At the same time,

910
00:27:46.401 --> 00:27:48.110
we're cutting funding for education.

911
00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:50.180
We're privatizing public schools,

912
00:27:50.181 --> 00:27:51.920
which is a complete and utter disaster

913
00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:52.781
<v 0>subsidy.</v>

914
00:27:52.781 --> 00:27:53.970
Sounds like they should get it.

915
00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:54.991
It's like,

916
00:27:54.991 --> 00:27:55.111
well,

917
00:27:55.111 --> 00:27:56.250
there's this oil subsidies.

918
00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:57.000
Okay.

919
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:57.833
Oil subsidies,

920
00:27:58.050 --> 00:27:58.381
you know,

921
00:27:58.381 --> 00:28:03.381
it's not like oil donations or oil payola if they'd call it oil payola who would

922
00:28:04.171 --> 00:28:04.381
go,

923
00:28:04.381 --> 00:28:05.214
wait a minute.

924
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:06.263
What is that?

925
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:07.441
Why do they get more?

926
00:28:07.441 --> 00:28:07.681
I don't.

927
00:28:07.681 --> 00:28:08.670
They have a lot of money.

928
00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:09.000
Yeah.

929
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:09.833
What's happening here?

930
00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.930
<v 2>Profitable industry in the United States,</v>

931
00:28:11.931 --> 00:28:12.800
in the world.

932
00:28:12.801 --> 00:28:13.191
You know,

933
00:28:13.191 --> 00:28:14.024
so it's,

934
00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:15.440
it's frustrating stuff,

935
00:28:15.441 --> 00:28:16.670
but fortunately,

936
00:28:16.671 --> 00:28:16.941
you know,

937
00:28:16.941 --> 00:28:18.290
there are ways around it.

938
00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.290
Citizens United was a terrible supreme court ruling,

939
00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:26.060
which effectively allows corporations to act as people and make these unlimited

940
00:28:26.061 --> 00:28:27.950
campaign donations to politicians.

941
00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:32.030
So one way that you can get around that is by creating a constitutional

942
00:28:32.031 --> 00:28:32.570
amendment,

943
00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:34.610
which we're trying to do at the young Turks.

944
00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:35.030
Um,

945
00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:38.570
there's a political action committee that we formed called Wolf Pack.

946
00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:39.291
I'm,

947
00:28:39.291 --> 00:28:43.550
your audience can learn more about it at wolf dot dash [inaudible] dot com and

948
00:28:43.551 --> 00:28:46.100
basically it would have state leaders,

949
00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:46.993
um,

950
00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.240
propose a resolution and the resolution would,

951
00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:50.781
uh,

952
00:28:50.781 --> 00:28:55.730
create a constitutional convention where you can make an amendment to the

953
00:28:55.731 --> 00:28:59.630
constitution that would get money out of politics and that would fix so many

954
00:28:59.631 --> 00:29:04.631
problems because then our broken democracy would change into a system that it

955
00:29:04.881 --> 00:29:05.960
was intended to be.

956
00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:09.080
Where our elected politicians are supposed to represent us,

957
00:29:09.081 --> 00:29:11.900
the people instead of corporations.

958
00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:12.221
<v 0>Well,</v>

959
00:29:12.221 --> 00:29:14.800
when you back something in the corner and shine a light on it,

960
00:29:14.801 --> 00:29:16.600
you really get to know its true nature.

961
00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:16.841
Yeah.

962
00:29:16.841 --> 00:29:18.610
And if that ever does come to play,

963
00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:22.810
it would be a very fascinating moment to see how the system that's in place

964
00:29:22.811 --> 00:29:26.830
today would deal with the idea of taking money out of politics and what kind of

965
00:29:26.831 --> 00:29:28.480
a scramble would take place.

966
00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:28.780
Yeah,

967
00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:29.440
that would be,

968
00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.330
it would be quite weird to say.

969
00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:31.930
<v 2>It would be.</v>

970
00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:32.560
It's,

971
00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:33.460
I'm not gonna lie,

972
00:29:33.461 --> 00:29:35.290
it's definitely going to be difficult to do.

973
00:29:35.291 --> 00:29:36.124
I,

974
00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:36.491
you know,

975
00:29:36.491 --> 00:29:38.770
Janky Ugur is really optimistic about it.

976
00:29:38.771 --> 00:29:40.570
I'm not as optimistic as he is,

977
00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.850
but I think that if,

978
00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:47.410
if the American people become a little more politically active and they signed

979
00:29:47.411 --> 00:29:52.210
the petitions necessary and they hold their state representatives accountable,

980
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:53.890
I think that this could happen.

981
00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:54.341
You know,

982
00:29:54.341 --> 00:29:58.090
it just takes a little bit of political activism and unfortunately there's this

983
00:29:58.091 --> 00:29:59.890
huge level of apathy right now,

984
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:00.580
um,

985
00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:05.160
which I don't understand because the political climate is leading to this

986
00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:09.250
economic meltdown and all of the problems that people are experiencing right

987
00:30:09.251 --> 00:30:09.610
now.

988
00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:10.600
Income inequality,

989
00:30:10.601 --> 00:30:11.770
wealth inequality,

990
00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:13.000
it's scary stuff.

991
00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:13.750
I mean,

992
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:17.200
we lie to ourselves when we say that we live in the best country in the world.

993
00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.700
We have legalized bribery.

994
00:30:18.701 --> 00:30:19.690
We need to fix it.

995
00:30:19.691 --> 00:30:21.520
We need to fix our democratic process.

996
00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:22.670
When,

997
00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:25.180
when you look at the future of this country,

998
00:30:25.181 --> 00:30:26.080
the way it's running,

999
00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.060
the way it is currently operated,

1000
00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:29.740
how long can that,

1001
00:30:29.741 --> 00:30:31.660
it seems like it's fallen apart at the wheels.

1002
00:30:31.661 --> 00:30:36.430
It seems like it's like this crazy thing that's spinning and shaking and sucking

1003
00:30:36.431 --> 00:30:37.990
money out and freaking out.

1004
00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:40.360
How long can this thing operate the way it is right now?

1005
00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:41.733
I'm not sure.

1006
00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:41.981
I mean,

1007
00:30:41.981 --> 00:30:43.240
that's a really good question,

1008
00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:46.240
but people are really starting to feel,

1009
00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:46.600
you know,

1010
00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:47.433
the,

1011
00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.590
the downfall of how our system is working.

1012
00:30:50.591 --> 00:30:51.610
Like just to give you an example,

1013
00:30:51.611 --> 00:30:52.900
this number of blows my mind.

1014
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.800
Uh,

1015
00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:58.330
the top 10% in this country own 75% of the wealth.

1016
00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:00.280
That is bananas.

1017
00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:05.380
That's a lot of money and 10% ballers.

1018
00:31:05.381 --> 00:31:06.820
Everyone else is struggling.

1019
00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:07.750
They're struggling.

1020
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.380
Um,

1021
00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:11.440
top 1% owns one third of the wealth in the country.

1022
00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:12.220
Um,

1023
00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:15.700
and so people are struggling to make ends meet.

1024
00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:20.080
And the reason why that's happening is because we're seeing these huge tax cuts

1025
00:31:20.081 --> 00:31:21.580
for the most wealthiest people.

1026
00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:22.803
You know,

1027
00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:27.070
why is it that we're supposed to have the highest corporate tax rate?

1028
00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:28.083
But when,

1029
00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:30.220
because of corporate loopholes,

1030
00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:32.500
we actually have the lowest corporate tax rate.

1031
00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:35.650
I mean we got to get rid of those loopholes and then you have the Republicans

1032
00:31:35.651 --> 00:31:35.891
saying,

1033
00:31:35.891 --> 00:31:36.131
yeah,

1034
00:31:36.131 --> 00:31:36.491
you know what,

1035
00:31:36.491 --> 00:31:37.540
we should raise taxes.

1036
00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:40.090
One way we can do that is by getting rid of deductions.

1037
00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.190
Which deduction do they want to go after?

1038
00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:43.360
Homeowners,

1039
00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:46.500
they want to go after people who get that uh,

1040
00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:49.180
interest rate deduction in their taxes.

1041
00:31:49.181 --> 00:31:51.790
And that of course impacts the middle class.

1042
00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:53.470
So it's just,

1043
00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.420
there's just a lot of frustrating stuff going on.

1044
00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:59.050
It seems like there's too much stuff going on for everybody to pay attention to

1045
00:31:59.051 --> 00:31:59.601
everything.

1046
00:31:59.601 --> 00:32:01.570
And that's one of the reasons where the apathy comes down.

1047
00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:02.710
It's just too freaky.

1048
00:32:02.711 --> 00:32:03.940
There's too much happening.

1049
00:32:03.941 --> 00:32:04.774
It's too nutty.

1050
00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:05.920
It's not going to get fixed.

1051
00:32:05.921 --> 00:32:06.754
Shit.

1052
00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:07.481
Close the shade.

1053
00:32:07.481 --> 00:32:08.260
I'm going to take a nap,

1054
00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.150
I'm going to watch the Kardashians or,

1055
00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:10.450
you know,

1056
00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:13.030
play video games or do whatever I need to do to distract myself.

1057
00:32:13.031 --> 00:32:14.560
And I don't blame people for doing that.

1058
00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:17.710
A lot of these issues are really complicated and complex.

1059
00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:18.070
You know,

1060
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:20.200
you have to sit down and do so much research.

1061
00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:23.470
We have this mainstream media that's also broken.

1062
00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.090
They're not reporting the real news.

1063
00:32:25.091 --> 00:32:25.301
You know,

1064
00:32:25.301 --> 00:32:28.660
you have to really depend on independent media to get real facts.

1065
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:31.360
And so I don't blame people for wanting to be distracted,

1066
00:32:31.361 --> 00:32:32.440
but at the same time,

1067
00:32:32.441 --> 00:32:34.720
if we allow things to continue the way they are,

1068
00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.600
we're going to have the wealthiest people living in their castles with motes

1069
00:32:37.601 --> 00:32:38.434
around them.

1070
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:42.740
While we're going to struggle to find private security because everything that

1071
00:32:42.741 --> 00:32:45.260
is publicly funded is going to be defunded,

1072
00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:46.850
including our education.

1073
00:32:46.851 --> 00:32:47.900
We're seeing that happen now.

1074
00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:52.830
<v 0>Nobody ever wants to think that the operating system that we have that runs our</v>

1075
00:32:52.831 --> 00:32:54.210
society could fall apart.

1076
00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.910
Nobody ever wants to think that all of a sudden there'll be no cops cause they

1077
00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:57.770
don't get paid.

1078
00:32:57.770 --> 00:32:57.911
That's,

1079
00:32:57.911 --> 00:32:59.460
that's happened in places like Camden,

1080
00:32:59.461 --> 00:32:59.791
New Jersey.

1081
00:32:59.791 --> 00:33:00.050
Yep.

1082
00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:01.070
<v 2>Perfect example.</v>

1083
00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:01.320
Yeah.

1084
00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:02.240
Enough cops.

1085
00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:03.141
It's insane.

1086
00:33:03.141 --> 00:33:03.771
And of course,

1087
00:33:03.771 --> 00:33:05.770
I mean it's common sense.

1088
00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:08.060
Their crime rate shot up as a result of that.

1089
00:33:08.061 --> 00:33:08.510
Of course

1090
00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:09.410
<v 0>it was a free ride.</v>

1091
00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:09.860
Yup.

1092
00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:10.430
I mean that,

1093
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:10.730
that's,

1094
00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:12.800
if you were like a really bad person,

1095
00:33:12.801 --> 00:33:14.660
does like the best place to move in the country.

1096
00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:15.050
Yup.

1097
00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:15.381
He'll be like,

1098
00:33:15.381 --> 00:33:15.561
look,

1099
00:33:15.561 --> 00:33:17.690
there's no cops then they don't even have them.

1100
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:18.410
Yeah.

1101
00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:19.243
That's

1102
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:20.910
<v 2>mall little crumble</v>

1103
00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:24.510
<v 0>laying in the foundation of our society or just a little one and you know,</v>

1104
00:33:24.511 --> 00:33:25.860
maybe they fixed it for now,

1105
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:28.110
but eventually that could happen.

1106
00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.570
There was an Anthony Bordain special I was watching today.

1107
00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:31.830
His name.

1108
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:32.071
Yeah,

1109
00:33:32.071 --> 00:33:32.904
he's great.

1110
00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:35.580
His new show for the CNN show,

1111
00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:38.270
he was in Detroit and uh,

1112
00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:41.550
he was just going over these factories where they used to make these amazing

1113
00:33:41.551 --> 00:33:44.820
cars and now they're just completely fallen apart and it's,

1114
00:33:44.821 --> 00:33:45.240
it's,

1115
00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:46.200
it's freaky.

1116
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:51.120
It's freaky to see how this city of 2 million plus people now is like less than

1117
00:33:51.121 --> 00:33:53.970
700,000 and you could buy a house for like 500 bucks.

1118
00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:57.600
And he was like touring around the city and checking it out and I was that if

1119
00:33:57.601 --> 00:33:59.250
that can happen that quickly.

1120
00:33:59.280 --> 00:33:59.850
Yup.

1121
00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:02.490
That's just one city that can happen other places too.

1122
00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:06.510
I like this whole thing is like barely hey together with chewing gum.

1123
00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:09.620
<v 2>And I think the most frustrating part about that is,</v>

1124
00:34:09.621 --> 00:34:14.621
you know we have politicians that will pass policies that lead to the collapse

1125
00:34:15.171 --> 00:34:16.160
of certain cities.

1126
00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:19.950
California is in a lot of trouble right now because of a proposition we pass in

1127
00:34:19.951 --> 00:34:24.951
1978 called proposition 13 it capped property taxes at 1.2% and as a result we

1128
00:34:26.421 --> 00:34:27.890
started defunding our education,

1129
00:34:27.891 --> 00:34:31.250
which is why the La Usd went from being one of the best school districts in the

1130
00:34:31.251 --> 00:34:33.740
country to being one of the worst school districts in the country.

1131
00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:38.630
And we just lost out on a ton of revenue as a result of our low,

1132
00:34:38.631 --> 00:34:40.100
very low property taxes.

1133
00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:43.610
And so they'll pass policies like that.

1134
00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:44.660
In the case of California,

1135
00:34:44.661 --> 00:34:46.640
of course Californians voted for it,

1136
00:34:46.641 --> 00:34:47.660
which was disastrous.

1137
00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:51.230
But then at the same time they'll cut government programs that'll help the

1138
00:34:51.231 --> 00:34:52.100
poorest people,

1139
00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:56.600
whether it's the snap program or the food stamp program or you know,

1140
00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:57.830
the welfare programs,

1141
00:34:57.831 --> 00:34:59.390
wherever that help needy kids.

1142
00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:00.230
And it's like,

1143
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.501
look,

1144
00:35:00.501 --> 00:35:04.460
if you don't want to spend this much money on governmental programs or social

1145
00:35:04.461 --> 00:35:05.294
programs,

1146
00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:09.320
then stop passing policies and tax cuts that make it really,

1147
00:35:09.321 --> 00:35:11.150
really difficult for people to make ends meet.

1148
00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:11.791
<v 0>Well,</v>

1149
00:35:11.791 --> 00:35:16.380
I think if it wasn't for shows like yours and people like you and chank who are

1150
00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:19.140
exposing this stuff and people in the new media,

1151
00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:20.280
people that are writing these very,

1152
00:35:20.281 --> 00:35:21.540
very popular blogs,

1153
00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:22.770
if it wasn't for that,

1154
00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:23.130
yeah,

1155
00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:26.700
this information wouldn't be going out and if the information wasn't going out,

1156
00:35:26.701 --> 00:35:29.010
people wouldn't realize what a cluster fuck it really is.

1157
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:32.630
They would tune into the nightly news and get this sense that everything's going

1158
00:35:32.631 --> 00:35:33.390
to be okay.

1159
00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:36.600
Which is basically what America did until the Internet came around.

1160
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:37.463
Yeah.

1161
00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:37.881
Yeah.

1162
00:35:37.881 --> 00:35:41.100
It seems like within the 10 15 plus years of the act of Internet,

1163
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.200
the whole world is just stopped and went,

1164
00:35:43.201 --> 00:35:43.471
wait,

1165
00:35:43.471 --> 00:35:44.520
what the fuck are we doing?

1166
00:35:44.521 --> 00:35:45.840
Like everyone shaking their head,

1167
00:35:45.841 --> 00:35:46.830
looking left and right.

1168
00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:48.270
Confusion,

1169
00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:52.080
turmoil and questioning on a level that I don't think we've seen before.

1170
00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:57.560
And this weird new thing where anybody can just stick a camera and attach,

1171
00:35:57.970 --> 00:36:00.270
know a Usb it to a laptop and boom,

1172
00:36:00.271 --> 00:36:01.020
you're online.

1173
00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:01.410
I know.

1174
00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:04.530
Making youtube videos or making mp3s.

1175
00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:05.010
Yeah,

1176
00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:05.791
it's incredible.

1177
00:36:05.791 --> 00:36:06.511
It's a weird,

1178
00:36:06.511 --> 00:36:07.344
weird time.

1179
00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:11.800
<v 2>Gets me really excited like just thinking about it because the possibilities are</v>

1180
00:36:11.801 --> 00:36:12.634
endless.

1181
00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:13.660
And I mean,

1182
00:36:13.661 --> 00:36:15.280
we had the young Turks,

1183
00:36:15.281 --> 00:36:16.690
we had no marketing budget,

1184
00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.010
we had no publicity,

1185
00:36:18.011 --> 00:36:19.360
we had nothing.

1186
00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:22.690
All we did was create a business model that worked.

1187
00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:23.140
Uh,

1188
00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:26.290
Jank does the really serious political reporting,

1189
00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:27.280
which I'm jealous of.

1190
00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:28.360
That's what I want to do.

1191
00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:29.030
Um,

1192
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:31.870
and then I come in and I do the stuff that goes viral online.

1193
00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:32.630
Why would she be

1194
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:35.090
<v 0>jealous of paying attention to this system?</v>

1195
00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.260
<v 2>I love politics.</v>

1196
00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:38.610
I love politics.

1197
00:36:38.611 --> 00:36:39.080
I,

1198
00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:40.380
and don't get me wrong,

1199
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:41.333
Marriott,

1200
00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:43.350
maybe I will know the,

1201
00:36:43.351 --> 00:36:44.970
I love I,

1202
00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:48.630
I mean I studied political science for my masters and it's just always been a

1203
00:36:48.631 --> 00:36:50.490
passion of mine since I was in high school.

1204
00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:51.150
So,

1205
00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:53.580
even though things are really bad right now,

1206
00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:56.100
I have this passion to try to make a difference.

1207
00:36:56.130 --> 00:37:00.180
And so I see Jank making a difference and I'm really proud of him and he's

1208
00:37:00.181 --> 00:37:01.710
someone that's been my mentor,

1209
00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:03.360
someone that I look up to.

1210
00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:04.381
And you know,

1211
00:37:04.381 --> 00:37:08.670
I want to be able to analyze politics as well as he does.

1212
00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:09.571
At the same time,

1213
00:37:09.571 --> 00:37:09.751
you know,

1214
00:37:09.751 --> 00:37:11.430
I was brought in for something completely different.

1215
00:37:11.431 --> 00:37:14.970
I was brought in to make the company money and that's basically what I do.

1216
00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:15.511
Um,

1217
00:37:15.511 --> 00:37:20.010
the stories that I cover in my hour of the show are sometimes very important

1218
00:37:20.011 --> 00:37:21.210
social stories.

1219
00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:21.781
Um,

1220
00:37:21.781 --> 00:37:21.961
you know,

1221
00:37:21.961 --> 00:37:22.980
whether it's gay rights,

1222
00:37:22.981 --> 00:37:23.701
women's rights,

1223
00:37:23.701 --> 00:37:24.301
whatever,

1224
00:37:24.301 --> 00:37:24.631
you know,

1225
00:37:24.631 --> 00:37:28.350
men's rights when it comes to how they get screwed over,

1226
00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:28.760
you know,

1227
00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:32.460
when it comes to children and marriage and basically the law,

1228
00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:33.090
men,

1229
00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:36.570
men are basically screwed over when it comes to sexual harassment and stuff.

1230
00:37:36.571 --> 00:37:37.950
But women aren't like,

1231
00:37:37.951 --> 00:37:38.784
it's amazing.

1232
00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:39.330
Um,

1233
00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:40.410
but that's a side note,

1234
00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:41.670
but then,

1235
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:42.150
you know,

1236
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:44.340
I'll do the stories that are really stupid,

1237
00:37:44.341 --> 00:37:45.600
but people love them.

1238
00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:50.190
Like we'll do a Miley Cyrus story and it'll get like millions of views and we'll

1239
00:37:50.191 --> 00:37:52.050
make a ton of money off that video,

1240
00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:54.450
but there's no value to that story.

1241
00:37:54.451 --> 00:37:56.190
So I always feel guilty doing it.

1242
00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:57.031
So I'll have,

1243
00:37:57.031 --> 00:37:58.320
I'll have days where I'm just like,

1244
00:37:58.321 --> 00:37:58.890
yeah,

1245
00:37:58.890 --> 00:37:59.723
I'm,

1246
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:00.990
I'm a big failure.

1247
00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:04.070
This is what I do for my life and I feel guilty about it.

1248
00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:05.570
<v 0>I hear what you're saying.</v>

1249
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:06.740
But at the same time,

1250
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:10.700
following politics is like following some fucking fake minstrel show.

1251
00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:12.073
It's fake.

1252
00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:12.980
It's discouraging.

1253
00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:13.900
There's no question about it.

1254
00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:19.040
I always feel like I had this conversation with Jamie Kilstein wants from s dude

1255
00:38:19.041 --> 00:38:19.874
from citizen radio.

1256
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:21.380
I knew what they were talking about,

1257
00:38:21.381 --> 00:38:22.214
politics and I go,

1258
00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:27.200
do you ever think that by following this fake horse and pony show that you're

1259
00:38:27.201 --> 00:38:27.560
like,

1260
00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:30.650
you like lending credence to it because you're an intelligent person and you're

1261
00:38:30.651 --> 00:38:34.730
pretending this isn't all just assholes who are getting bribed because that's

1262
00:38:34.731 --> 00:38:35.680
what it is.

1263
00:38:35.681 --> 00:38:35.861
Yeah.

1264
00:38:35.861 --> 00:38:36.160
It's really

1265
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.160
<v 4>just a bunch of assholes that are getting bribed and they're the ones and</v>

1266
00:38:39.161 --> 00:38:43.570
they're cronyism and all this weird shit going on with laws and things they can

1267
00:38:43.571 --> 00:38:46.150
and can't get away with and what they can and can't get charged with.

1268
00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:46.950
<v 3>Well,</v>

1269
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:47.281
I mean,

1270
00:38:47.281 --> 00:38:47.491
look,

1271
00:38:47.491 --> 00:38:47.820
there's,

1272
00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:51.330
there's a huge difference between political reporters in the mainstream that

1273
00:38:51.331 --> 00:38:52.350
just report on it,

1274
00:38:52.351 --> 00:38:54.480
but they don't really give a shit about making a difference.

1275
00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:57.900
And then there's a huge difference between people like Jamie and Allison on

1276
00:38:57.901 --> 00:39:00.810
citizen radio or the young Turks or any other,

1277
00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:02.190
uh,

1278
00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:03.023
what is it called?

1279
00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:04.333
Ah,

1280
00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:05.760
named just a lost me.

1281
00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:06.811
No,

1282
00:39:06.811 --> 00:39:07.644
not Alex Jones.

1283
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:10.703
Alex Jones.

1284
00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:14.130
You guy's been stealing our thunder for coming at you.

1285
00:39:14.131 --> 00:39:15.270
A youtube views.

1286
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:20.790
infowars.com the number one media source in the nation.

1287
00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:25.380
Young Turks tries to pretend they have similar ratings.

1288
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:27.690
So you've seen that.

1289
00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:28.711
That's awesome.

1290
00:39:28.711 --> 00:39:29.730
Alex is a friend of mine.

1291
00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:30.260
Is He?

1292
00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:30.450
Yeah,

1293
00:39:30.450 --> 00:39:31.283
he's crazy.

1294
00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:31.890
Yeah,

1295
00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:32.520
he's crazy.

1296
00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:33.160
He's mine.

1297
00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:33.780
It's mine.

1298
00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:36.180
I have no problem with a great guy though.

1299
00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:37.050
I love him.

1300
00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:37.471
If you met him,

1301
00:39:37.471 --> 00:39:38.304
he's a sweetheart.

1302
00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:40.260
Did meet him and he ended up liking him.

1303
00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.220
So I believe it.

1304
00:39:41.221 --> 00:39:41.820
I believe it.

1305
00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:42.060
Um,

1306
00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:44.520
but his response video to us was hilarious.

1307
00:39:44.521 --> 00:39:45.600
I'll so many different levels.

1308
00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:47.280
Like put a shirt on dude.

1309
00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:48.630
What a fucking shirt on.

1310
00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:51.540
Like if you're trying to make a decent point and you don't want to seem like

1311
00:39:51.541 --> 00:39:52.320
you're loony,

1312
00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:53.500
put a fucking shirt off

1313
00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.033
but don't.

1314
00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:56.990
If you're Allen's Joe's,

1315
00:39:56.991 --> 00:39:57.161
y'all,

1316
00:39:57.161 --> 00:40:00.450
y'all fucking shirt over 111 stations,

1317
00:40:00.451 --> 00:40:03.430
XM probably naked.

1318
00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:06.151
Most likely.

1319
00:40:06.151 --> 00:40:06.811
These websites,

1320
00:40:06.811 --> 00:40:07.440
more views.

1321
00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:08.280
No one's gonna care.

1322
00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:10.320
I'm number one.

1323
00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:10.501
Oh,

1324
00:40:10.501 --> 00:40:12.300
I love this video period.

1325
00:40:12.301 --> 00:40:13.110
Globally.

1326
00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:14.340
Even Rolling Stone,

1327
00:40:14.341 --> 00:40:15.420
New York magazine,

1328
00:40:15.421 --> 00:40:16.830
all the gun actuaries.

1329
00:40:16.831 --> 00:40:17.664
I'm number one.

1330
00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:19.320
He's number one period.

1331
00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:20.130
Yeah.

1332
00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:20.963
By the way,

1333
00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:21.930
he's,

1334
00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:23.100
here's one that he's missing.

1335
00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:24.593
It's a shirt

1336
00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:28.120
that later.

1337
00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:28.953
He's,

1338
00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:30.653
he's crazy.

1339
00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:32.880
I've known Alex Long

1340
00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:33.301
<v 4>Time.</v>

1341
00:40:33.301 --> 00:40:38.301
I did a DVD in 1999 and he and I put on a Bush masks.

1342
00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:42.900
I was a Bush junior and he was Bush senior and we put on these mask,

1343
00:40:42.901 --> 00:40:44.160
we ran around the,

1344
00:40:44.161 --> 00:40:44.290
uh,

1345
00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:45.640
Austin state capitol,

1346
00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:49.410
like the Front Yard and filmed it when Bush got elected.

1347
00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:51.960
The title of DVD was belly of the beast.

1348
00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:52.830
So I like,

1349
00:40:52.831 --> 00:40:54.270
it was right when Bush was getting elected.

1350
00:40:54.271 --> 00:40:56.280
We decided to do this in Austin and he,

1351
00:40:56.281 --> 00:40:57.540
him and me are in this,

1352
00:40:57.541 --> 00:40:57.900
uh,

1353
00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:59.820
this video and he's singing a song.

1354
00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:03.000
He sings this like crazy new world order song when he wrote,

1355
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.391
Oh,

1356
00:41:03.391 --> 00:41:03.670
that's,

1357
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:04.381
that's not us.

1358
00:41:04.381 --> 00:41:05.280
That's a different one.

1359
00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:07.140
The other one,

1360
00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:09.030
we were actually wearing these masks,

1361
00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:10.051
but uh,

1362
00:41:10.051 --> 00:41:10.640
I've known him for

1363
00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:11.390
<v 3>forever.</v>

1364
00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:12.620
He's a really good guy.

1365
00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:13.161
I don't,

1366
00:41:13.161 --> 00:41:13.670
I don't,

1367
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:14.900
I don't deny that.

1368
00:41:14.901 --> 00:41:15.920
I'm sure he is a good guy.

1369
00:41:15.921 --> 00:41:17.660
I don't tell me the truth.

1370
00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:24.610
Is he like playing a role when he's on camera because I don't believe that he's

1371
00:41:24.981 --> 00:41:26.000
really that crazy.

1372
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:28.010
Like some of the stuff he says,

1373
00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:30.590
I just don't believe he believes I'm,

1374
00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:31.360
I do

1375
00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.193
<v 4>not know.</v>

1376
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:33.620
I would not to know.

1377
00:41:33.621 --> 00:41:35.420
I think he's a very complex man.

1378
00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:38.420
I think there's a lot going on beneath the surface.

1379
00:41:38.421 --> 00:41:42.140
There's a lot of layers to that cake and I think that a lot of people look at

1380
00:41:42.141 --> 00:41:43.610
him and think he's a screaming maniac.

1381
00:41:43.611 --> 00:41:46.640
But he was right about a lot of shit.

1382
00:41:46.641 --> 00:41:48.170
A long time ago.

1383
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:52.400
He was saying that the NSA is going to be reading all your emails and looking

1384
00:41:52.401 --> 00:41:52.880
through,

1385
00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.070
he said they're there,

1386
00:41:54.071 --> 00:41:59.060
they're going to make deals with major data networks with a t and t and Google.

1387
00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:01.670
He was saying this a long time ago.

1388
00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:01.970
Yeah.

1389
00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:06.050
And I specifically remember having conversations with a friend and him and my

1390
00:42:06.051 --> 00:42:06.591
friend was like,

1391
00:42:06.591 --> 00:42:07.550
that is so crazy.

1392
00:42:07.551 --> 00:42:08.271
Why would they do that?

1393
00:42:08.271 --> 00:42:09.140
They're not going to do that.

1394
00:42:09.141 --> 00:42:09.530
Do you?

1395
00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:11.870
Do you really think that the law would ever let them do that?

1396
00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:12.570
<v 5>Hello?</v>

1397
00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:12.910
Hello.

1398
00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:13.091
Hey,

1399
00:42:13.091 --> 00:42:13.924
all the law.

1400
00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:14.401
<v 4>And he'll,</v>

1401
00:42:14.401 --> 00:42:16.920
he'll get fucking crazy and he'll go,

1402
00:42:16.921 --> 00:42:17.530
Alex Jones.

1403
00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:18.180
Iyanya

1404
00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:18.750
<v 2>but you know,</v>

1405
00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:19.583
here's the thing,

1406
00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:23.000
that strategy or that delivery is effective.

1407
00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:23.730
Um,

1408
00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:26.820
because there have been people who have been reporting about,

1409
00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:27.091
you know,

1410
00:42:27.091 --> 00:42:30.420
civil liberties violations for a while and they get no attention.

1411
00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:34.050
So sometimes the squeaky wheel will get the attention and you know,

1412
00:42:34.051 --> 00:42:34.560
if,

1413
00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:37.830
if that's what he needs to do to get coverage of those important new stories,

1414
00:42:37.831 --> 00:42:38.664
it's totally fine.

1415
00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:39.631
The thing is,

1416
00:42:39.631 --> 00:42:40.464
you know,

1417
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:41.450
there,

1418
00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:45.060
there are little sprinkles of truth to some of the stuff that he reports.

1419
00:42:45.061 --> 00:42:48.120
And then some of the stuff that he reports is just crazy and it's made up,

1420
00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:48.931
you know,

1421
00:42:48.931 --> 00:42:49.650
so it's like,

1422
00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:53.850
I don't know where to fall with that guy because I want to support them with

1423
00:42:53.851 --> 00:42:54.541
some stories.

1424
00:42:54.541 --> 00:42:55.291
But then other stories,

1425
00:42:55.291 --> 00:42:55.651
I'm like,

1426
00:42:55.651 --> 00:42:56.040
dude,

1427
00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.070
you need to tone it down.

1428
00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:57.870
<v 4>Well,</v>

1429
00:42:57.870 --> 00:43:01.830
I don't know what the process is for acquiring information,

1430
00:43:01.831 --> 00:43:02.611
vetting it out,

1431
00:43:02.611 --> 00:43:03.900
and then publishing it,

1432
00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:05.880
yelling at the youtube channel.

1433
00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:06.900
I don't know what it is,

1434
00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:07.890
what the process is,

1435
00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:11.370
but I know that he's right about a lot of things and I know that he's passionate

1436
00:43:11.371 --> 00:43:12.270
about a lot of things,

1437
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:16.740
but I think that he probably needs a better filter.

1438
00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:17.580
Yeah.

1439
00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:18.001
You know,

1440
00:43:18.001 --> 00:43:19.380
I think there's a few rants.

1441
00:43:19.381 --> 00:43:20.250
He'll go on.

1442
00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:20.641
We'll,

1443
00:43:20.641 --> 00:43:21.001
you're like,

1444
00:43:21.001 --> 00:43:21.834
wait a minute.

1445
00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:22.801
Oh,

1446
00:43:22.801 --> 00:43:23.341
wait a minute.

1447
00:43:23.341 --> 00:43:24.540
What the fuck are they doing?

1448
00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:24.971
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1449
00:43:24.971 --> 00:43:25.804
Chem trails.

1450
00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:29.050
Do you understand how many planes were in the sky every night?

1451
00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:32.350
Brian Chem trails blocking out the sun.

1452
00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:35.710
I can't even fucking grow tomatoes here in Austin,

1453
00:43:35.711 --> 00:43:36.544
Texas.

1454
00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:37.230
<v 2>No,</v>

1455
00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:37.310
no,

1456
00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:37.491
no.

1457
00:43:37.491 --> 00:43:39.380
Your impression of him is amazing.

1458
00:43:39.381 --> 00:43:41.720
I've been hanging out with them more than a decade.

1459
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:42.680
That's uncanny.

1460
00:43:42.681 --> 00:43:43.514
That's insane.

1461
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:44.121
<v 4>But he,</v>

1462
00:43:44.121 --> 00:43:44.510
um,

1463
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:46.730
he'll go off about something and then you'll go,

1464
00:43:46.731 --> 00:43:48.710
but did you know that this and that and that,

1465
00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:48.920
you know,

1466
00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:49.191
like you'll,

1467
00:43:49.191 --> 00:43:50.450
you'll have counters to those,

1468
00:43:50.451 --> 00:43:52.040
but if those don't get in there,

1469
00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:52.480
yeah.

1470
00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:53.390
Those don't get in there.

1471
00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:54.440
They get new world.

1472
00:43:54.441 --> 00:43:55.060
Order it out.

1473
00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:55.910
If they get black Holler,

1474
00:43:55.911 --> 00:43:56.620
copter it out.

1475
00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:57.030
Yeah.

1476
00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:57.470
Yes.

1477
00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:58.370
Ricochet off.

1478
00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:02.480
He wants to see a conspiracy in every fucking thing that's ever existed ever.

1479
00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:05.000
If you come up to him about whatever it is,

1480
00:44:05.001 --> 00:44:06.420
name at JFK,

1481
00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:09.620
the Iran Contra Whitewater death of Vince foster.

1482
00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:09.880
Yeah.

1483
00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:10.450
<v 5>So there's,</v>

1484
00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:11.590
there's a million stories.

1485
00:44:11.591 --> 00:44:12.230
Worries.

1486
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.981
<v 4>They never end.</v>

1487
00:44:12.981 --> 00:44:14.270
He'll just fucking come at you.

1488
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:16.970
But he's been right about a lot of stuff that's really freaky.

1489
00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:17.300
Yeah.

1490
00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:22.300
One thing that he reported on that very few people caught was the use of paid

1491
00:44:23.241 --> 00:44:28.241
police officers to pretend to be people that are in a crowd protesting and then

1492
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:32.010
agent provocateurs and they

1493
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:33.540
<v 0>would start smashing things.</v>

1494
00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:33.810
Yeah.

1495
00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:34.531
He covered this.

1496
00:44:34.531 --> 00:44:38.790
And Seattle when the World Trade Organization was making there will believe it

1497
00:44:38.791 --> 00:44:40.290
was the 90s when they were,

1498
00:44:40.291 --> 00:44:44.350
there was these massive protests and the protests went violent while he,

1499
00:44:44.351 --> 00:44:47.700
he has all these photos of like the bottom of their boots,

1500
00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:51.840
military issue vibrams and he like points all this like these are police

1501
00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:52.743
officers,

1502
00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:53.940
they're wearing masks,

1503
00:44:53.941 --> 00:44:54.720
no one else is.

1504
00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:56.280
And they're the only ones doing any damage there,

1505
00:44:56.281 --> 00:44:58.080
smashing things and they're doing it.

1506
00:44:58.081 --> 00:45:01.620
So then the police can come in and start arresting peaceful people,

1507
00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:03.180
which they normally couldn't do.

1508
00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:06.390
And I thought that was the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life.

1509
00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:06.580
Okay.

1510
00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:08.050
<v 2>The crazy thing is,</v>

1511
00:45:08.051 --> 00:45:08.291
you know,

1512
00:45:08.291 --> 00:45:10.180
when it came to the occupy protestors,

1513
00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:12.090
they weren't even agent provocateurs.

1514
00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:15.730
They were just cops like breaking shit and starting the violence.

1515
00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:16.510
And you know,

1516
00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:18.100
they got a little bit of criticism for it,

1517
00:45:18.101 --> 00:45:22.120
but the media would pick up the story and make it seem as though the occupy

1518
00:45:22.121 --> 00:45:23.560
protesters were the violent ones.

1519
00:45:23.561 --> 00:45:26.200
They would do everything necessary to discredit them,

1520
00:45:26.201 --> 00:45:31.090
which made me so angry because finally in this country there was a little bit of

1521
00:45:31.091 --> 00:45:32.260
political activism.

1522
00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:36.880
They changed the conversation because we were talking about bullshit until

1523
00:45:36.881 --> 00:45:38.620
occupy came along and talked about wealth,

1524
00:45:38.621 --> 00:45:38.951
wealth,

1525
00:45:38.951 --> 00:45:39.784
inequality.

1526
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:40.380
Um,

1527
00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:41.141
and then you know,

1528
00:45:41.141 --> 00:45:44.440
you have the mainstream that totally discredited them and then they just kind of

1529
00:45:44.441 --> 00:45:45.130
fizzled out.

1530
00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:47.950
And I had so much hope for that movement.

1531
00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:51.840
I really know what fuck that movement w them not being organized.

1532
00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:54.010
So with soap soap,

1533
00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:55.020
what didn't get enough?

1534
00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:55.511
Oh,

1535
00:45:55.511 --> 00:45:56.344
I see what you're saying.

1536
00:45:56.350 --> 00:45:56.591
Yes.

1537
00:45:56.591 --> 00:46:00.310
To many stinky motherfuckers out there and drum circles I cover is a big part of

1538
00:46:00.311 --> 00:46:00.490
it.

1539
00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:00.910
I caught,

1540
00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:03.670
I covered occupy La and occupy Oakland.

1541
00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:09.120
Occupy Oakland was a scary situation to cover because there they were a lot more

1542
00:46:09.311 --> 00:46:09.851
militant.

1543
00:46:09.851 --> 00:46:10.300
Their,

1544
00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:12.700
I mean their intentions were in the right place,

1545
00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:14.980
but their delivery was a little scary.

1546
00:46:14.981 --> 00:46:18.130
So I just kind of felt like shit could hit the fan.

1547
00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:18.521
Yeah.

1548
00:46:18.521 --> 00:46:21.730
Like one wrong move and violence could break out.

1549
00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:22.090
Uh,

1550
00:46:22.090 --> 00:46:22.360
but,

1551
00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:23.090
but they,

1552
00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:23.650
they,

1553
00:46:23.650 --> 00:46:25.600
it was because they were overly protective.

1554
00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.940
They knew what was happening to other protesters.

1555
00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:28.510
You know,

1556
00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:30.640
look at what happened at Uc Davis.

1557
00:46:30.641 --> 00:46:31.240
I think,

1558
00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:31.691
you know what,

1559
00:46:31.691 --> 00:46:34.930
that cop spraying that pepper spray on those students that are just sitting

1560
00:46:34.931 --> 00:46:35.620
there.

1561
00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:35.891
Um,

1562
00:46:35.891 --> 00:46:38.830
so I think that they were just overly protective as they should have been

1563
00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:41.500
because of the treatment that all these protesters were dealing with

1564
00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:43.410
<v 0>and the treatment throughout history.</v>

1565
00:46:43.411 --> 00:46:46.050
I mean all they have to do is go back and to look at what was going on during

1566
00:46:46.051 --> 00:46:46.861
the Vietnam War.

1567
00:46:46.861 --> 00:46:48.990
Look at what happened at Kent State when they start shooting.

1568
00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:49.830
Then the arm,

1569
00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:53.540
the national guard is shooting at the students that were protesting.

1570
00:46:53.541 --> 00:46:54.000
I mean that,

1571
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.790
that's not that long ago people were aware of that kind of stuff.

1572
00:46:57.090 --> 00:46:59.160
But when I saw this Alex Jones thing,

1573
00:46:59.161 --> 00:47:00.910
I really thought it was the dumbest thing I'd ever seen.

1574
00:47:00.930 --> 00:47:01.291
I was like,

1575
00:47:01.291 --> 00:47:03.450
this is no way that could ever be possible.

1576
00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:04.111
There's no way.

1577
00:47:04.111 --> 00:47:07.560
Co and then he presents it like very clearly,

1578
00:47:07.561 --> 00:47:09.240
very cleanly over and over again,

1579
00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:13.680
all the different news stories that pointed to different various incidents that

1580
00:47:13.681 --> 00:47:14.101
took place,

1581
00:47:14.101 --> 00:47:15.210
including them.

1582
00:47:15.370 --> 00:47:16.203
So request they,

1583
00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:19.260
they got all of the agent provocateurs in a house,

1584
00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:21.510
the cops negotiated with them and then let them go.

1585
00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:25.200
I mean the whole thing goes like so cut and dry and clear.

1586
00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:27.320
<v 2>When you have evidence backing up,</v>

1587
00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:27.651
you know,

1588
00:47:27.651 --> 00:47:29.440
your belief that something is a conspiracy.

1589
00:47:29.441 --> 00:47:30.430
Then of course,

1590
00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:33.250
<v 3>I mean you have strong evidence and all believe it.</v>

1591
00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:33.840
Um,

1592
00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:35.710
but it's one thing to have the evidence.

1593
00:47:35.711 --> 00:47:39.760
It's another thing to purport that something is going on and then not having the

1594
00:47:39.761 --> 00:47:40.594
evidence to that.

1595
00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:42.010
I think he needs a filter.

1596
00:47:42.830 --> 00:47:46.760
<v 4>I think he's got a lot of his heart and his intentions are in the right place</v>

1597
00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:48.260
and the dude will go to war.

1598
00:47:48.350 --> 00:47:51.410
Like you'll fucking took it out in the street with somebody.

1599
00:47:51.411 --> 00:47:52.550
He's fucking crazy.

1600
00:47:52.551 --> 00:47:53.384
I'm aware.

1601
00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:53.840
Yeah,

1602
00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:54.620
he's a madman,

1603
00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:56.090
but he's also a good guy.

1604
00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:56.890
Like I,

1605
00:47:56.890 --> 00:47:58.760
I just think that he needs a filter.

1606
00:47:59.130 --> 00:47:59.730
Yeah.

1607
00:47:59.730 --> 00:48:00.381
But he's right.

1608
00:48:00.381 --> 00:48:01.250
More than he's wrong.

1609
00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:02.121
I'll tell you that.

1610
00:48:02.121 --> 00:48:02.691
Especially now.

1611
00:48:02.691 --> 00:48:03.111
This is,

1612
00:48:03.111 --> 00:48:03.231
uh,

1613
00:48:03.231 --> 00:48:05.300
Alex and me and uh,

1614
00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:06.973
that's,

1615
00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:10.100
that's Alex on the left and me on the right.

1616
00:48:10.101 --> 00:48:11.210
And this is his song.

1617
00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:13.910
Oh my God,

1618
00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:14.990
this,

1619
00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:15.880
that's Alex singing.

1620
00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:20.063
That's,

1621
00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:21.950
that's great.

1622
00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:23.570
That's my buddy.

1623
00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:25.270
He's up there.

1624
00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:25.770
He is.

1625
00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:27.590
And just sounds like a fun person to hang out with.

1626
00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:27.891
Yeah.

1627
00:48:27.891 --> 00:48:29.270
He's very fun to hang out with.

1628
00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:31.010
He's great to drink beers with.

1629
00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:31.460
Yeah,

1630
00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:32.600
I can imagine a good dude.

1631
00:48:32.601 --> 00:48:33.380
He's funny.

1632
00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:34.880
He says a lot of really funny shit.

1633
00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:35.600
He's,

1634
00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:36.500
he's a good guy too.

1635
00:48:36.501 --> 00:48:37.221
He's a sweetheart.

1636
00:48:37.221 --> 00:48:37.791
He really is.

1637
00:48:37.791 --> 00:48:41.120
So did he ever talk to you about why he got on us about like views?

1638
00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:41.331
Oh,

1639
00:48:41.331 --> 00:48:43.640
I don't ask him any questions about things like that.

1640
00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:47.900
He's been in some disputes with friends of mine and he's been disputes welcomes

1641
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:48.080
girl.

1642
00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:48.561
Just go.

1643
00:48:48.561 --> 00:48:49.640
It's just Alex man.

1644
00:48:49.641 --> 00:48:50.930
You got to have to deal with that on your own.

1645
00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:52.670
That is really funny.

1646
00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:53.300
Yeah.

1647
00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:53.721
But he's,

1648
00:48:53.721 --> 00:48:54.351
like I say,

1649
00:48:54.351 --> 00:48:55.520
he's a good guy.

1650
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:56.211
He's just,

1651
00:48:56.211 --> 00:48:58.040
he wants a better America.

1652
00:48:58.041 --> 00:48:58.761
He really does.

1653
00:48:58.761 --> 00:49:00.050
He's not in a greedy guy.

1654
00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:02.390
He's not a guy who's in it for the money.

1655
00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:07.820
<v 3>Are you the shirt off his back clearly aren't using stamps.com.</v>

1656
00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:09.541
<v 4>He,</v>

1657
00:49:09.541 --> 00:49:10.140
uh,

1658
00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:12.420
he really is like the real deal.

1659
00:49:12.421 --> 00:49:12.601
Like,

1660
00:49:12.601 --> 00:49:14.490
he really wants a better America.

1661
00:49:14.491 --> 00:49:16.550
He really wants to get out all the corruption,

1662
00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:17.250
the scum.

1663
00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:20.880
But he believes that the global elites are trying to live to be a thousand years

1664
00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:21.000
old.

1665
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.740
What they're doing right now with stem cells,

1666
00:49:22.741 --> 00:49:25.440
the reason why the Bush administration and they'll just like,

1667
00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:27.690
how did you meet him?

1668
00:49:27.691 --> 00:49:28.560
How did that happen?

1669
00:49:28.650 --> 00:49:29.101
Uh,

1670
00:49:29.101 --> 00:49:29.761
I met him,

1671
00:49:29.761 --> 00:49:30.211
uh,

1672
00:49:30.211 --> 00:49:32.430
in Texas through a friend of mine who's friends with him.

1673
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:34.560
I knew him from his radio day.

1674
00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:35.730
Well he still has a radio show,

1675
00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:37.200
but now it's more Internet based.

1676
00:49:37.201 --> 00:49:38.580
But he had a radio show.

1677
00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:40.470
I think his radio show is still pretty popular though.

1678
00:49:40.471 --> 00:49:42.330
And like those dudes that have those fucking,

1679
00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:43.890
those a ham radios.

1680
00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:45.440
Yeah.

1681
00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:47.580
Tune in tune in the Alex Jones,

1682
00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:51.390
the fucking just thinking that that's this is that thinking that,

1683
00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:51.631
you know,

1684
00:49:51.631 --> 00:49:54.630
the only problem with that is just that thinking that goes along with that,

1685
00:49:54.631 --> 00:49:56.700
which is like collect gold,

1686
00:49:56.730 --> 00:49:58.920
like dig a hole in the ground for a nuclear shelter.

1687
00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:02.760
<v 3>They're like preppers and people start putting battering rams and their pickup</v>

1688
00:50:02.761 --> 00:50:03.594
trucks lazy.

1689
00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:05.610
I don't think that's the way to do it.

1690
00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:09.870
I don't want to live my life like that where you're constantly paranoid and

1691
00:50:09.871 --> 00:50:11.780
you're worried about dooms day there.

1692
00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:12.390
Look,

1693
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:15.750
there's some really scary shit happening in the government right now.

1694
00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:18.060
I will not take take away from that,

1695
00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:22.500
but I don't believe in the doomsday prepper is like they need to calm down their

1696
00:50:22.501 --> 00:50:22.791
paranoia.

1697
00:50:22.791 --> 00:50:24.000
Paranoia's misplaced

1698
00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:28.220
<v 4>unless something happens like what happened two days ago in the Philippines.</v>

1699
00:50:28.221 --> 00:50:28.610
Yes.

1700
00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:29.060
Yeah.

1701
00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:29.450
That's,

1702
00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:30.560
that's the real issue.

1703
00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:31.420
Yeah.

1704
00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:32.190
Mother Nature.

1705
00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:34.970
Mother Nature is the issue and we keep fucking with her.

1706
00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:38.660
So allegedly allegedly that because you know,

1707
00:50:38.661 --> 00:50:40.760
not enough scientists agree on,

1708
00:50:40.761 --> 00:50:41.594
you know,

1709
00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:42.831
excuse me.

1710
00:50:42.831 --> 00:50:45.200
There's plenty of scientists that disagree.

1711
00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:48.350
They also all happen to be working for oil companies,

1712
00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:50.080
gas companies.

1713
00:50:50.310 --> 00:50:51.410
They'll call the brothers.

1714
00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:56.480
The Koch Brothers will fund scientists to put out studies that claim that either

1715
00:50:56.481 --> 00:50:58.490
climate change does not exist.

1716
00:50:58.600 --> 00:50:58.771
It.

1717
00:50:58.771 --> 00:51:03.560
This is just a normal trend that we were experiencing with our planet or that it

1718
00:51:03.561 --> 00:51:03.951
exists,

1719
00:51:03.951 --> 00:51:04.660
but it's not,

1720
00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:05.150
you know,

1721
00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:09.080
created by humans way back to the 1950s they were doing that with cigarettes

1722
00:51:09.250 --> 00:51:11.510
when when people were trying to come out saying,

1723
00:51:11.511 --> 00:51:11.661
hey,

1724
00:51:11.661 --> 00:51:13.250
I think these things are giving us cancer.

1725
00:51:13.330 --> 00:51:13.580
Yeah,

1726
00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:16.070
we fucking funded a shitload of studies and we're like,

1727
00:51:16.071 --> 00:51:16.461
no,

1728
00:51:16.461 --> 00:51:16.611
look,

1729
00:51:16.611 --> 00:51:17.990
it's absolutely good for you.

1730
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.780
Yeah.

1731
00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:20.840
You can find certain things.

1732
00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:24.440
We were talking about it on the podcast yesterday worth nicotine actually can be

1733
00:51:24.441 --> 00:51:29.330
a medicine in certain circumstances help people with heart issues and ADHD

1734
00:51:29.331 --> 00:51:30.770
issues and all these different things.

1735
00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:35.920
So like you could find a way to rationalize if you were a real piece of shit

1736
00:51:36.171 --> 00:51:37.850
that like you should probably smoke cigarettes.

1737
00:51:38.310 --> 00:51:39.650
You won't get Adhd.

1738
00:51:39.870 --> 00:51:40.703
Yeah.

1739
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:46.270
Another example of money influencing the behavior of Americans and the

1740
00:51:47.361 --> 00:51:49.010
information that gets put out there.

1741
00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:50.553
Yeah.

1742
00:51:50.650 --> 00:51:54.620
When we were talking earlier about being addicted to items and being addicted to

1743
00:51:54.621 --> 00:51:56.600
things and how you wanted to get a bigger apartment,

1744
00:51:56.601 --> 00:51:57.434
even though you don't need it.

1745
00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:58.730
I'm guilty as charged too,

1746
00:51:58.731 --> 00:52:03.731
but I think about it all the time and what I'm starting to believe is that human

1747
00:52:04.491 --> 00:52:09.440
beings like the reason why we like to think of ourselves as being something that

1748
00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:13.160
we're in much more in control of then the just the woes of nature.

1749
00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:17.180
But I kinda think that more likely than that everything is natural.

1750
00:52:17.330 --> 00:52:21.080
And even though we break down like ant behavior is being natural and wolf

1751
00:52:21.081 --> 00:52:22.220
behavior is being natural,

1752
00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:22.971
but humans,

1753
00:52:22.971 --> 00:52:23.331
well,

1754
00:52:23.331 --> 00:52:23.691
you know,

1755
00:52:23.691 --> 00:52:25.880
we have freewill and we have education.

1756
00:52:25.881 --> 00:52:27.410
We have maybe,

1757
00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:30.080
but when I look at like the trend,

1758
00:52:30.081 --> 00:52:31.250
like where it is right now,

1759
00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:31.510
it's,

1760
00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:32.450
I don't know how it got here,

1761
00:52:32.451 --> 00:52:33.710
but let's pretend it's all nature.

1762
00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:34.850
What is it doing?

1763
00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:37.460
But what it's doing is it's making things.

1764
00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:40.480
It's making crazier and crazier things everyday.

1765
00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:42.380
The whole race is working together.

1766
00:52:42.381 --> 00:52:47.381
And one of the ways it ensures that people consistently technologically innovate

1767
00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:49.880
is by making it attractive to have the newest,

1768
00:52:49.881 --> 00:52:50.714
latest shit.

1769
00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:51.890
And everybody wants it.

1770
00:52:51.891 --> 00:52:52.130
And like,

1771
00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:52.401
Ooh,

1772
00:52:52.401 --> 00:52:53.151
that new Lexus,

1773
00:52:53.151 --> 00:52:53.871
look at that commercial.

1774
00:52:53.871 --> 00:52:54.231
Oh my God,

1775
00:52:54.231 --> 00:52:57.830
I got a habit and it's a fucking new laptop and it's a new phone and it's a new

1776
00:52:57.831 --> 00:52:58.664
ear piece.

1777
00:52:58.840 --> 00:52:59.870
I mean it's also,

1778
00:52:59.871 --> 00:53:01.820
it's also a status thing.

1779
00:53:01.850 --> 00:53:04.670
It's a status symbol to have the latest and greatest.

1780
00:53:04.671 --> 00:53:05.180
No doubt.

1781
00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:07.490
We recently covered this story about Barneys.

1782
00:53:07.491 --> 00:53:09.200
I don't know if you've talked about it at all and you're a show,

1783
00:53:09.201 --> 00:53:13.130
but there was this young black man who went into a Barney's.

1784
00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:18.310
He purchased a $350 belt with a debit card and allegedly the cashier called the

1785
00:53:20.241 --> 00:53:24.590
authorities on him because she didn't believe that a black guy can afford this

1786
00:53:24.591 --> 00:53:25.860
$350 belt.

1787
00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:27.450
<v 2>So the cops came,</v>

1788
00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:28.920
they started questioning him.

1789
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:30.090
They said,

1790
00:53:30.090 --> 00:53:33.330
we know we need proof indicating that that's your debit card.

1791
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:36.390
He had to call chase and prove like,

1792
00:53:36.391 --> 00:53:36.751
yes,

1793
00:53:36.751 --> 00:53:37.890
that is his debit card,

1794
00:53:37.891 --> 00:53:38.310
you know,

1795
00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:39.750
they like detained them for a little while.

1796
00:53:39.751 --> 00:53:40.920
And then finally they let him go.

1797
00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:43.590
So he's suing Barneys now for racial profiling.

1798
00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.330
So we'll see how that case plays out.

1799
00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:46.650
But you know,

1800
00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:50.550
aside from the racial profiling component of that story,

1801
00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:55.650
I was just shocked that I think he's 19 that a 19 year old would save up

1802
00:53:55.651 --> 00:54:00.150
multiple paychecks by the way to Po to buy a $350 belt.

1803
00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:01.051
And it's like,

1804
00:54:01.051 --> 00:54:02.490
it goes against everything.

1805
00:54:02.491 --> 00:54:03.120
I believe.

1806
00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:05.250
I hate that kind of materialism and I'm not,

1807
00:54:05.251 --> 00:54:06.061
he's a victim here,

1808
00:54:06.061 --> 00:54:07.500
so I'm not trying to criticize him.

1809
00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:12.390
It's more of a societal thing where we all want to show off our new shiny

1810
00:54:12.490 --> 00:54:14.970
handbag and it's fucking bullshit.

1811
00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:20.120
I hate when women fall for that crap when they work multiple months just to

1812
00:54:20.611 --> 00:54:22.770
afford like a $2,500 handbag.

1813
00:54:22.771 --> 00:54:23.131
And it's like,

1814
00:54:23.131 --> 00:54:24.360
who are you trying to prove?

1815
00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:27.180
Like what are you trying to prove and who you're trying to prove it to?

1816
00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:29.070
You're trying to show off to other women,

1817
00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:29.640
right?

1818
00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:30.241
Which by the way,

1819
00:54:30.241 --> 00:54:31.740
if you're like a real woman,

1820
00:54:31.741 --> 00:54:33.810
I think that you shouldn't get jealous by that kind of crap.

1821
00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:34.750
You know?

1822
00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:35.471
<v 4>And real woman.</v>

1823
00:54:35.471 --> 00:54:35.681
Well,

1824
00:54:35.681 --> 00:54:36.760
you said it like a real man

1825
00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:38.861
masculine,

1826
00:54:38.861 --> 00:54:39.070
like,

1827
00:54:39.070 --> 00:54:39.820
no,

1828
00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:40.960
<v 2>I have this.</v>

1829
00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:42.400
As I get older,

1830
00:54:42.401 --> 00:54:43.360
I mean I'm,

1831
00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:48.430
I'm getting obsessed with a person's character and I'm,

1832
00:54:48.431 --> 00:54:48.910
I'm,

1833
00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:51.280
I care less and less about the bullshit.

1834
00:54:51.281 --> 00:54:51.941
That doesn't matter.

1835
00:54:51.941 --> 00:54:53.410
So when I was younger,

1836
00:54:53.530 --> 00:54:53.830
you know,

1837
00:54:53.830 --> 00:54:55.300
I got brainwashed into thinking,

1838
00:54:55.301 --> 00:54:55.541
Hey,

1839
00:54:55.541 --> 00:54:56.374
you know what?

1840
00:54:56.740 --> 00:55:00.850
You need to make sure that you marry a guy who's like really established in his

1841
00:55:00.851 --> 00:55:03.100
career because you want to make sure you can take care of you.

1842
00:55:03.370 --> 00:55:04.151
Fuck that.

1843
00:55:04.151 --> 00:55:05.560
I want to take care of myself.

1844
00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:07.330
Like I don't need a guy to take care of me.

1845
00:55:07.331 --> 00:55:08.320
And that's not to say that I,

1846
00:55:08.321 --> 00:55:09.610
I don't want a man in my life.

1847
00:55:09.611 --> 00:55:10.690
I definitely do.

1848
00:55:10.691 --> 00:55:14.680
I want a partner in my life and I want it to be like a real partnership where we

1849
00:55:14.681 --> 00:55:15.550
help each other out.

1850
00:55:15.790 --> 00:55:16.750
But at the same time,

1851
00:55:16.751 --> 00:55:19.870
like this obsession with materialism makes me sick to my stomach.

1852
00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:20.950
It's distracting.

1853
00:55:21.130 --> 00:55:24.430
And it makes people feel that if they can't afford certain things,

1854
00:55:24.610 --> 00:55:25.780
then they're not good enough,

1855
00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:27.070
that they're not worthy.

1856
00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:28.810
If they don't have the money to shop at Barney's,

1857
00:55:28.811 --> 00:55:29.710
then they're less than,

1858
00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:30.470
<v 4>well,</v>

1859
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:31.640
I definitely think you're right.

1860
00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:33.650
From a sociological last part,

1861
00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:33.980
uh,

1862
00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:34.491
aspect.

1863
00:55:34.491 --> 00:55:35.251
I feel like the,

1864
00:55:35.251 --> 00:55:35.491
the,

1865
00:55:35.491 --> 00:55:36.790
the whole desire is,

1866
00:55:36.791 --> 00:55:41.791
is fruitless and silly and weird and it exists more it with people that can't

1867
00:55:41.841 --> 00:55:43.850
have it and want it very badly,

1868
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:46.760
but there's a lot of people that are rich that just go shopping every day,

1869
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:48.800
but it's just the whole never gets filled.

1870
00:55:48.830 --> 00:55:49.100
Yeah.

1871
00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:49.521
It's always,

1872
00:55:49.521 --> 00:55:51.440
it's never like the big rush that you get.

1873
00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:54.430
At least if you're poor and you buy a $2,000 watch,

1874
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:55.400
like Holy Shit,

1875
00:55:55.401 --> 00:55:55.880
and you look at it,

1876
00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:57.020
I can't believe I got it.

1877
00:55:57.021 --> 00:55:57.740
Woo.

1878
00:55:57.740 --> 00:55:57.970
Well,

1879
00:55:57.970 --> 00:55:58.910
if you're really wealthy,

1880
00:55:58.911 --> 00:56:00.290
if you're some billionaire character,

1881
00:56:00.350 --> 00:56:00.920
nothing,

1882
00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:01.281
nothing.

1883
00:56:01.281 --> 00:56:02.300
It doesn't even register.

1884
00:56:02.301 --> 00:56:05.570
It's like this doll thumping on your helmet because it never really gets to

1885
00:56:05.571 --> 00:56:06.330
skin.

1886
00:56:06.330 --> 00:56:06.751
<v 2>I just,</v>

1887
00:56:06.751 --> 00:56:10.840
I don't like making people feel like they're worthless because they can't afford

1888
00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:12.300
<v 4>for them.</v>

1889
00:56:12.350 --> 00:56:14.490
They mean who makes them feel like that?

1890
00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:14.941
Is it a,

1891
00:56:14.941 --> 00:56:16.410
isn't it on them and it,

1892
00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:17.740
<v 2>sure.</v>

1893
00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:17.981
I mean,

1894
00:56:17.981 --> 00:56:18.211
look at,

1895
00:56:18.211 --> 00:56:19.180
listen to pop culture,

1896
00:56:19.181 --> 00:56:20.770
listen to all the rap songs and all that.

1897
00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:21.371
Oh,

1898
00:56:21.371 --> 00:56:21.761
you know,

1899
00:56:21.761 --> 00:56:22.810
I got my new,

1900
00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:24.273
or whatever.

1901
00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:30.780
I don't think they brag about that car.

1902
00:56:30.790 --> 00:56:31.623
Don't get me wrong,

1903
00:56:32.170 --> 00:56:32.681
whatever,

1904
00:56:32.681 --> 00:56:33.011
whatever.

1905
00:56:33.011 --> 00:56:34.530
I got my Mayback right,

1906
00:56:34.690 --> 00:56:35.021
right.

1907
00:56:35.021 --> 00:56:36.070
They rap about that shit.

1908
00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:37.510
Who cares about your may back?

1909
00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:37.841
You know,

1910
00:56:37.841 --> 00:56:38.051
like,

1911
00:56:38.051 --> 00:56:39.880
I don't know why people are so obsessed with that.

1912
00:56:40.090 --> 00:56:41.650
And then these young kids think,

1913
00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:42.521
oh my God,

1914
00:56:42.521 --> 00:56:44.650
I got to work really hard for that may back.

1915
00:56:44.651 --> 00:56:47.620
Which is why so many people get involved in the financial sector and they sell

1916
00:56:47.621 --> 00:56:49.870
their souls because they just want to be rich.

1917
00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:53.260
And we need people who want to be teachers.

1918
00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:54.250
You know,

1919
00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:55.000
I'll be at,

1920
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.460
most of them get screwed over with really,

1921
00:56:57.461 --> 00:57:00.280
really crappy salaries and we should definitely pay our teachers better.

1922
00:57:00.490 --> 00:57:04.450
But people don't gravitate toward jobs that actually helped the community

1923
00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:07.060
because they're so obsessed with making money.

1924
00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:11.920
And I hate seeing our brightest students go toward the financial sector instead

1925
00:57:11.921 --> 00:57:12.310
of,

1926
00:57:12.310 --> 00:57:12.581
you know,

1927
00:57:12.581 --> 00:57:15.040
focusing on jobs that do help the community,

1928
00:57:15.041 --> 00:57:15.581
whether it's,

1929
00:57:15.581 --> 00:57:15.911
you know,

1930
00:57:15.911 --> 00:57:16.241
in,

1931
00:57:16.241 --> 00:57:21.241
in fields that lead to technological innovation or to medical innovation.

1932
00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:23.890
And of course doctors make a lot of money,

1933
00:57:23.891 --> 00:57:24.431
but you know,

1934
00:57:24.431 --> 00:57:28.240
a lot of scientists that do some serious research that really benefits society

1935
00:57:28.241 --> 00:57:29.260
don't make a lot of money.

1936
00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:30.160
It's true.

1937
00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:31.040
And so I,

1938
00:57:31.041 --> 00:57:35.440
I just hate the incentive structure that we have these days and this emphasis on

1939
00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:36.850
always having the,

1940
00:57:36.851 --> 00:57:37.870
the newest,

1941
00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:40.120
most expensive item available.

1942
00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:41.650
<v 0>It's definitely ridiculous.</v>

1943
00:57:41.890 --> 00:57:45.400
But as a person trying make an attempt to look at it objectively,

1944
00:57:45.401 --> 00:57:48.580
if I was like an alien species to coming down to observe earth,

1945
00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:52.750
I would say they're in a mad scramble to create the next technological marvel.

1946
00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:54.850
They're in a mad scramble to create the,

1947
00:57:55.210 --> 00:57:56.140
the new Internet,

1948
00:57:56.170 --> 00:57:57.003
the next thing.

1949
00:57:57.010 --> 00:57:58.810
And they're going to go from that to the next thing.

1950
00:57:58.811 --> 00:57:59.860
They're transforming themselves.

1951
00:57:59.861 --> 00:58:00.431
They're essentially,

1952
00:58:00.431 --> 00:58:04.960
it's a longterm cocoon that turns a caterpillar into a butterfly.

1953
00:58:04.961 --> 00:58:06.370
It's just taking a few hundred years.

1954
00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:09.970
But technologically there's some sort of a symbiotic relationship that we have

1955
00:58:10.210 --> 00:58:10.511
with,

1956
00:58:10.511 --> 00:58:13.330
with technology and that's fueled by materialism,

1957
00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:14.531
materialism,

1958
00:58:14.531 --> 00:58:15.364
drive.

1959
00:58:15.370 --> 00:58:20.370
It ensures that people consistently by the newest things innovate and constantly

1960
00:58:20.381 --> 00:58:21.550
trying to impress with the latest.

1961
00:58:21.551 --> 00:58:22.030
Yeah.

1962
00:58:22.030 --> 00:58:23.860
I just sociologically,

1963
00:58:23.861 --> 00:58:25.060
I agree with you 100%.

1964
00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:25.420
Yeah.

1965
00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:26.440
But I think that there's,

1966
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:28.100
there's probably something more going on yeah.

1967
00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:30.550
And we're just not aware of because we're like trapped in the middle of the

1968
00:58:30.551 --> 00:58:31.480
hurricane of it all.

1969
00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:32.090
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1970
00:58:32.090 --> 00:58:33.890
I think you make a really good point about,

1971
00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:34.370
you know,

1972
00:58:34.370 --> 00:58:35.030
uh,

1973
00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:36.500
gadgets and technology.

1974
00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:40.580
I guess what I'm more focused on is just like the designer bullshit that people

1975
00:58:40.581 --> 00:58:41.210
buy into.

1976
00:58:41.210 --> 00:58:42.043
That kind of stuff

1977
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.760
<v 0>frustrates me.</v>

1978
00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:44.760
I just think it's a side shoot of the same issue.

1979
00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:46.350
The money thing too.

1980
00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:47.430
I think about that,

1981
00:58:47.431 --> 00:58:50.820
like this desire to pursue massive amounts of money and chain.

1982
00:58:50.970 --> 00:58:52.260
What does that all really doing?

1983
00:58:52.350 --> 00:58:52.591
I mean,

1984
00:58:52.591 --> 00:58:55.410
if it's all just a pool of money and everybody's trying to,

1985
00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:56.273
you know,

1986
00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:58.200
keep it moving and keep it active,

1987
00:58:58.260 --> 00:58:59.190
what does it really do?

1988
00:58:59.191 --> 00:58:59.371
Well,

1989
00:58:59.371 --> 00:59:01.050
it buys things and if it's buying thing,

1990
00:59:01.051 --> 00:59:02.070
someone's making things,

1991
00:59:02.250 --> 00:59:04.410
someone's making things are going to keep improving those things because

1992
00:59:04.411 --> 00:59:05.370
everybody wants the newest thing.

1993
00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:05.611
Yeah.

1994
00:59:05.611 --> 00:59:07.560
It's basically the same engine,

1995
00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:11.940
this innovation engine that's like pushing forward and we're all trapped up in

1996
00:59:11.941 --> 00:59:15.480
it in like as calling it culture and calling it all these other different

1997
00:59:15.481 --> 00:59:16.010
things.

1998
00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:17.130
But what it really is,

1999
00:59:17.131 --> 00:59:17.500
is a,

2000
00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:20.040
a mad scramble to make new technology.

2001
00:59:20.130 --> 00:59:20.400
So

2002
00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:20.851
<v 3>what's your,</v>

2003
00:59:20.851 --> 00:59:21.980
what's your guilty pleasure?

2004
00:59:21.981 --> 00:59:25.760
Like what do you like to splurge on even though you might feel that might be

2005
00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:26.890
really,

2006
00:59:26.890 --> 00:59:27.720
yeah,

2007
00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:28.050
it does.

2008
00:59:28.050 --> 00:59:28.850
I could expensive.

2009
00:59:28.850 --> 00:59:29.091
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

2010
00:59:29.091 --> 00:59:29.924
They get expensive.

2011
00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:30.710
Yeah.

2012
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:31.071
Yeah.

2013
00:59:31.071 --> 00:59:31.431
Well,

2014
00:59:31.431 --> 00:59:31.850
I,

2015
00:59:31.850 --> 00:59:32.090
I,

2016
00:59:32.090 --> 00:59:32.600
I'm,

2017
00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:34.850
there's an art form to making pool cues,

2018
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:36.350
believe it or not.

2019
00:59:36.351 --> 00:59:36.920
And um,

2020
00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:38.810
I play a lot of pool and uh,

2021
00:59:38.811 --> 00:59:39.381
I used to play,

2022
00:59:39.381 --> 00:59:40.101
I was obsessed.

2023
00:59:40.101 --> 00:59:40.701
I used to play eight,

2024
00:59:40.701 --> 00:59:42.110
10 hours a day when I lived in New York.

2025
00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:42.381
I was,

2026
00:59:42.381 --> 00:59:43.214
it was,

2027
00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:43.680
yeah.

2028
00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:45.650
When my manager was telling me that it was a,

2029
00:59:45.651 --> 00:59:46.850
it was affecting my career.

2030
00:59:46.851 --> 00:59:50.090
It was because I was paying more attention to playing pool than I was to comedy.

2031
00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:50.691
Yeah.

2032
00:59:50.691 --> 00:59:50.901
It was,

2033
00:59:50.901 --> 00:59:52.010
I was completely obsessed.

2034
00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:53.133
Um,

2035
00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:57.350
but there's not that many pool cue manufacturers,

2036
00:59:57.351 --> 00:59:57.921
makers,

2037
00:59:57.921 --> 00:59:59.090
the but the artisans,

2038
00:59:59.091 --> 01:00:00.140
the real handmade ones.

2039
01:00:00.410 --> 01:00:01.550
Like there's a,

2040
01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:04.100
a guy named Sam Bodie berries and Bodie,

2041
01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:05.360
he's like world famous.

2042
01:00:05.361 --> 01:00:06.260
His Dad was Gus,

2043
01:00:06.261 --> 01:00:08.480
Sam bodies' was one of the original pool cue makers.

2044
01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:12.170
Like that name has like a lot of weight to it and these cues or like this

2045
01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:15.710
artistic functional art that you could play pool with,

2046
01:00:15.711 --> 01:00:17.150
but they're also like really beautiful.

2047
01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:18.560
I'm fascinated by them.

2048
01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:19.920
My friend created,

2049
01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:24.140
my friend Eric has a company called sugar tree and he makes these beautiful cues

2050
01:00:24.141 --> 01:00:29.141
all based on woods that are like really exotic and strange Berles and,

2051
01:00:29.610 --> 01:00:33.290
and weird like figure in the wood and he's obsessed with wood.

2052
01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:34.920
And because like you get like you,

2053
01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:35.330
you,

2054
01:00:35.330 --> 01:00:35.901
when you buy,

2055
01:00:35.901 --> 01:00:37.070
when it was Qsi you play with it,

2056
01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:41.030
you could literally see the passion that it took that this guy made this guy who

2057
01:00:41.031 --> 01:00:42.260
is obsessed with wood,

2058
01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:42.891
you know,

2059
01:00:42.891 --> 01:00:47.330
he's really obsessed with different grains and tonal qualities and aging them.

2060
01:00:47.331 --> 01:00:50.960
And it's this real artistic expression and it just,

2061
01:00:50.961 --> 01:00:52.490
it's a functional piece of art.

2062
01:00:52.491 --> 01:00:53.324
I'm obsessed with them.

2063
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.950
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

2064
01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:55.550
I mean there's nothing wrong with that.

2065
01:00:55.551 --> 01:00:57.280
That's very like obscure.

2066
01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:57.891
Like I like,

2067
01:00:57.891 --> 01:01:00.300
I've never heard anyone talk about pool cues.

2068
01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:00.711
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

2069
01:01:00.711 --> 01:01:01.230
That's my guy.

2070
01:01:01.230 --> 01:01:02.450
Have a big cabinet fill of them.

2071
01:01:02.451 --> 01:01:03.530
That's my guilty pleasure.

2072
01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:03.971
Nice.

2073
01:01:03.971 --> 01:01:04.280
Yeah.

2074
01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:04.910
Nice.

2075
01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:06.050
I just love to play pool.

2076
01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:06.650
Nice.

2077
01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:07.820
It's a stupid thing to do.

2078
01:01:07.850 --> 01:01:08.080
I mean,

2079
01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.800
it doesn't matter whether the ball goes in the hole,

2080
01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:11.540
but it does matter.

2081
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:12.463
Everything matters

2082
01:01:12.530 --> 01:01:15.080
<v 3>if that's what you find pleasurable and you know,</v>

2083
01:01:15.081 --> 01:01:17.120
it helps you blow off steam or whatever,

2084
01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:18.313
go for it.

2085
01:01:18.410 --> 01:01:19.400
There's nothing wrong with that.

2086
01:01:19.590 --> 01:01:20.460
<v 0>I think there's a,</v>

2087
01:01:20.550 --> 01:01:22.410
a microcosm to life in it.

2088
01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:24.750
I think there's a thing about pulling,

2089
01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:25.201
see these are,

2090
01:01:25.201 --> 01:01:25.740
these are,

2091
01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:26.370
uh,

2092
01:01:26.370 --> 01:01:27.840
handcrafted pool cues.

2093
01:01:27.841 --> 01:01:29.010
So how much do these cost?

2094
01:01:29.011 --> 01:01:29.660
Am I allowed to ask?

2095
01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:29.931
Yeah.

2096
01:01:29.931 --> 01:01:30.130
They,

2097
01:01:30.130 --> 01:01:32.250
some of them can cost several thousand dollars.

2098
01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:33.113
Wow.

2099
01:01:33.150 --> 01:01:34.350
Those ones you're looking at,

2100
01:01:34.351 --> 01:01:36.690
those are probably two or 3000 at least.

2101
01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:37.553
That's really pretty.

2102
01:01:37.830 --> 01:01:38.221
Yeah.

2103
01:01:38.221 --> 01:01:42.120
And they get real intricate and there's different ways they splice them

2104
01:01:42.121 --> 01:01:42.511
together.

2105
01:01:42.511 --> 01:01:44.880
Like you see those things at the end.

2106
01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:48.870
Like those are those little things inside of them are little inlays and as you

2107
01:01:48.871 --> 01:01:49.411
get further out,

2108
01:01:49.411 --> 01:01:52.050
those are different pieces of wood are spliced it together,

2109
01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:56.000
cut Kutney glued in place and then spun on a lathe and there,

2110
01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:56.370
you know,

2111
01:01:56.370 --> 01:02:00.630
exotic woods like that's ebony and he could see all these different uh,

2112
01:02:00.690 --> 01:02:01.470
in lace.

2113
01:02:01.470 --> 01:02:06.470
Some of them were probably made out of ivory and silver and all these terms they

2114
01:02:06.751 --> 01:02:07.270
used to,

2115
01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:09.990
you used to be legal to buy ivory to a,

2116
01:02:09.991 --> 01:02:13.320
to make pool cues with and he used to make the balls out of ivory and then

2117
01:02:13.321 --> 01:02:16.050
people realize what a piece of shit you have to be to kill an elephant.

2118
01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:17.340
So they cut that off,

2119
01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:20.310
but there's so much left over.

2120
01:02:20.311 --> 01:02:21.540
It's really kind of sad.

2121
01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:25.890
There's so much leftover from when they were just slaughtering elephants before

2122
01:02:26.130 --> 01:02:28.200
they started regulating it that you can get,

2123
01:02:28.201 --> 01:02:30.660
I've read and make in lays and stuff and pool cues.

2124
01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:31.733
It's everywhere.

2125
01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:33.300
So it becomes like a real issue,

2126
01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:34.350
like a moral issue.

2127
01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:35.071
You have to think like,

2128
01:02:35.071 --> 01:02:35.371
wow,

2129
01:02:35.371 --> 01:02:36.540
is that kind of fucked up?

2130
01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:37.681
But then it's like,

2131
01:02:37.681 --> 01:02:37.801
well,

2132
01:02:37.801 --> 01:02:38.070
what do you,

2133
01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:38.930
what are they going to do with the,

2134
01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:42.900
the animals like been dead since 1970 and they have these tusks,

2135
01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:45.990
he just going to let them go to waste or is it better to like put them in a

2136
01:02:45.991 --> 01:02:47.970
museum where people can look at them like it's a,

2137
01:02:48.210 --> 01:02:49.980
it's kind of an interesting moral dilemma,

2138
01:02:50.490 --> 01:02:52.380
but my friend Eric uses,

2139
01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:57.500
he uses this fossilized mastodon bone that he got.

2140
01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:02.950
He uses like 10,000 year old fossilized Walrus ivory that uh,

2141
01:03:02.970 --> 01:03:03.631
came from,

2142
01:03:03.631 --> 01:03:03.961
you know,

2143
01:03:03.961 --> 01:03:04.351
like they,

2144
01:03:04.351 --> 01:03:06.420
they just discovered get his hands on that.

2145
01:03:06.421 --> 01:03:07.081
That's insane.

2146
01:03:07.081 --> 01:03:08.700
Sisters and archaeologist.

2147
01:03:08.730 --> 01:03:09.421
Wow.

2148
01:03:09.421 --> 01:03:09.870
Yeah.

2149
01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:10.800
That's fascinating.

2150
01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:11.851
Yeah,

2151
01:03:11.851 --> 01:03:12.780
I think it's a sister.

2152
01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:13.351
Um,

2153
01:03:13.351 --> 01:03:13.861
but yeah,

2154
01:03:13.861 --> 01:03:14.221
he's,

2155
01:03:14.221 --> 01:03:15.840
he's like really into the,

2156
01:03:15.841 --> 01:03:17.820
I mean he doesn't use like that many,

2157
01:03:17.821 --> 01:03:19.380
he doesn't use like that money in lays.

2158
01:03:19.381 --> 01:03:20.790
His is all just about the wood,

2159
01:03:20.791 --> 01:03:21.960
like the quality of the wood.

2160
01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:23.271
<v 3>I like that.</v>

2161
01:03:23.271 --> 01:03:23.751
I like that.

2162
01:03:23.751 --> 01:03:24.531
That's really interesting.

2163
01:03:24.531 --> 01:03:25.190
I never,

2164
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:27.680
I would've never guessed that they could get that expensive.

2165
01:03:27.730 --> 01:03:27.900
<v 0>The,</v>

2166
01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:29.250
they get really expensive though.

2167
01:03:29.251 --> 01:03:30.040
Old Ones.

2168
01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:31.420
There's a man named ballot,

2169
01:03:31.421 --> 01:03:33.580
Bush [inaudible] who lived in,

2170
01:03:33.730 --> 01:03:38.440
you know like then he the 1960 [inaudible] and 1970s I think he made cues and in

2171
01:03:38.441 --> 01:03:39.790
the movie the color of money,

2172
01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:42.280
Paul Newman gave Tom Cruise a ballot,

2173
01:03:42.281 --> 01:03:42.970
Bush guy.

2174
01:03:42.970 --> 01:03:47.970
And just by saying that name that those cues started being worth 25 $30,000

2175
01:03:49.450 --> 01:03:50.830
because there's a finite number of,

2176
01:03:50.831 --> 01:03:51.401
and there's a fact,

2177
01:03:51.401 --> 01:03:56.140
it's probably like the queue that has the most forgeries is like Sam Bodie and

2178
01:03:56.141 --> 01:03:56.751
ballot Bush car,

2179
01:03:56.751 --> 01:03:57.280
the two,

2180
01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:58.180
a lot of fakes.

2181
01:03:58.230 --> 01:03:59.090
Why people like,

2182
01:03:59.290 --> 01:03:59.570
you know,

2183
01:03:59.570 --> 01:04:01.930
they'll just knock it off and pretend it's one of them cause you could sell it

2184
01:04:01.931 --> 01:04:03.160
for 25,000 bucks.

2185
01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:04.230
<v 3>You're,</v>

2186
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:06.220
I'm guilty pleasure as much better than mine.

2187
01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:07.420
My nerves just food,

2188
01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:09.280
food like I don't,

2189
01:04:09.281 --> 01:04:10.540
I can't really think of,

2190
01:04:10.541 --> 01:04:13.630
I'm an object that I like to spend a lot of money on.

2191
01:04:13.930 --> 01:04:16.720
I just like to spend a lot of money on like a good experience.

2192
01:04:16.721 --> 01:04:16.841
Like,

2193
01:04:16.841 --> 01:04:20.170
if I'm going to travel or if I'm going to eat at a nice restaurant,

2194
01:04:20.171 --> 01:04:21.100
I'm going to go all out,

2195
01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:21.761
you know,

2196
01:04:21.761 --> 01:04:22.960
and not feel bad about it.

2197
01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:23.590
Um,

2198
01:04:23.590 --> 01:04:24.550
but that's pretty much it.

2199
01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:25.930
That just sounds like life.

2200
01:04:26.410 --> 01:04:27.850
I know I have a guilty pleasure.

2201
01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:28.301
I know.

2202
01:04:28.301 --> 01:04:30.310
I guess I'm trying to think.

2203
01:04:30.311 --> 01:04:30.680
I'm,

2204
01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:33.010
I'm a huge bargain shopper.

2205
01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:33.850
I'm,

2206
01:04:33.850 --> 01:04:35.980
I don't really buy anything at full price.

2207
01:04:35.981 --> 01:04:36.990
I'm not really into that.

2208
01:04:37.210 --> 01:04:37.391
<v 0>Well,</v>

2209
01:04:37.391 --> 01:04:38.201
you should have said this.

2210
01:04:38.201 --> 01:04:38.670
Interesting.

2211
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:38.930
I,

2212
01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:39.220
um,

2213
01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:40.750
is this because of the way,

2214
01:04:40.751 --> 01:04:44.230
like your responsibility that you feel for looking at the world and seeing how

2215
01:04:44.231 --> 01:04:47.800
fucked up things are that you feel bad spending a couple hundred bucks on a nice

2216
01:04:47.801 --> 01:04:48.634
meal?

2217
01:04:48.970 --> 01:04:52.210
Is that like what it is that it becomes a guilty pleasure because you're like,

2218
01:04:52.211 --> 01:04:52.571
fuck it,

2219
01:04:52.571 --> 01:04:53.410
I'm just going to do it

2220
01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:54.490
<v 3>normally?</v>

2221
01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:54.790
Yeah,

2222
01:04:54.790 --> 01:04:55.361
maybe.

2223
01:04:55.361 --> 01:04:55.721
Maybe.

2224
01:04:55.721 --> 01:04:59.680
I think that there's something subconsciously that makes me feel guilty about

2225
01:04:59.681 --> 01:04:59.771
it,

2226
01:04:59.771 --> 01:05:01.300
but I can't really put my finger on it.

2227
01:05:01.450 --> 01:05:04.900
I think it's because I know how hard I work and you know,

2228
01:05:04.930 --> 01:05:08.860
seeing all that money go toward one experience or one meal makes me feel a

2229
01:05:08.861 --> 01:05:09.461
little bad.

2230
01:05:09.461 --> 01:05:11.270
But I actually would,

2231
01:05:11.410 --> 01:05:14.740
I like to do is if I'm going to go out and I'm going to spend some serious

2232
01:05:14.741 --> 01:05:15.131
money,

2233
01:05:15.131 --> 01:05:17.020
I make sure that I take people with me.

2234
01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:17.980
I spend the money on

2235
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:22.180
<v 2>them as well because then I feel like I'm doing something good for my friends.</v>

2236
01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:24.510
And I read this study about how I'm,

2237
01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:28.330
the happiest people will actually spend money on others.

2238
01:05:28.810 --> 01:05:29.830
And it's totally true.

2239
01:05:29.831 --> 01:05:32.200
You feel really good when you take care of other people.

2240
01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:32.921
Um,

2241
01:05:32.921 --> 01:05:33.460
so,

2242
01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:33.761
you know,

2243
01:05:33.761 --> 01:05:34.660
I usually do that.

2244
01:05:34.661 --> 01:05:34.810
That's,

2245
01:05:34.810 --> 01:05:36.130
that's not my guilty pleasure.

2246
01:05:36.131 --> 01:05:39.550
That's the one thing that I will splurge on and I won't feel guilty about it.

2247
01:05:39.551 --> 01:05:40.810
I'll feel really good about it.

2248
01:05:41.050 --> 01:05:41.771
And then I hope,

2249
01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:42.041
you know,

2250
01:05:42.041 --> 01:05:42.970
one day when,

2251
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.800
when my friends are in the mood,

2252
01:05:44.801 --> 01:05:46.660
like they'll take me out and they'll do the same thing.

2253
01:05:46.690 --> 01:05:47.523
One day you're waiting,

2254
01:05:47.590 --> 01:05:48.423
right?

2255
01:05:49.090 --> 01:05:49.331
I mean,

2256
01:05:49.331 --> 01:05:49.811
my friends,

2257
01:05:49.811 --> 01:05:50.740
I love my friends.

2258
01:05:50.741 --> 01:05:50.911
I,

2259
01:05:50.911 --> 01:05:52.150
I'm in a really,

2260
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:54.340
as someone in my age group,

2261
01:05:54.341 --> 01:05:59.341
I'm in a really great place financially because I lived at home for a long time.

2262
01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:00.790
I saved money.

2263
01:06:00.791 --> 01:06:03.010
I was with someone that I was going to buy a house with.

2264
01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:03.370
Um,

2265
01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:04.300
that didn't work out.

2266
01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:09.540
So now I just have money that I'm not going to put toward a house and I can do

2267
01:06:09.851 --> 01:06:10.690
other things with it.

2268
01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:12.900
So I like to treat my friends to things once a,

2269
01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:14.350
<v 0>you don't have to justify it.</v>

2270
01:06:14.430 --> 01:06:15.010
Yeah.

2271
01:06:15.010 --> 01:06:18.330
But it seems like the a part of you because you're such a conscious and aware

2272
01:06:18.350 --> 01:06:21.160
person realizes that you are in this rare circumstance.

2273
01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:21.490
Yeah.

2274
01:06:21.490 --> 01:06:23.500
So it feels like a guilty pleasure,

2275
01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:24.530
<v 2>I feel.</v>

2276
01:06:24.530 --> 01:06:25.640
I don't know if it's guilt,

2277
01:06:25.641 --> 01:06:29.520
but I feel bad about a lot of things because no,

2278
01:06:29.570 --> 01:06:30.060
I don't have,

2279
01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:31.970
I have white guilt is something I don't have,

2280
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:32.870
especially because,

2281
01:06:32.871 --> 01:06:33.321
and by the way,

2282
01:06:33.321 --> 01:06:36.050
I love that accusation that we get from our audience time to time,

2283
01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:37.670
all the fucking time.

2284
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.580
And it's so funny because like I'm Armenian,

2285
01:06:40.581 --> 01:06:41.211
like both my,

2286
01:06:41.211 --> 01:06:43.550
both my parents came from Armenia,

2287
01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:44.171
so they,

2288
01:06:44.171 --> 01:06:44.901
they didn't have,

2289
01:06:44.901 --> 01:06:46.850
like my ancestors didn't have slaves.

2290
01:06:47.090 --> 01:06:47.670
Like they,

2291
01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:48.331
they try and tell him,

2292
01:06:48.331 --> 01:06:49.164
you're not white.

2293
01:06:49.370 --> 01:06:50.061
I'm white,

2294
01:06:50.061 --> 01:06:52.190
but I'm not like I'm not American.

2295
01:06:52.770 --> 01:06:53.690
I am American.

2296
01:06:53.810 --> 01:06:53.991
Okay.

2297
01:06:53.991 --> 01:06:55.130
This is not sounding good.

2298
01:06:55.760 --> 01:07:00.760
But like to say to say that I have white guilt would imply that I have ancestry

2299
01:07:01.310 --> 01:07:03.410
that did hideous things to black people,

2300
01:07:03.411 --> 01:07:07.220
which is why I now want to raise awareness about issues of racism.

2301
01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:08.000
Um,

2302
01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:08.930
and that's not true.

2303
01:07:08.931 --> 01:07:13.520
I want to raise awareness about that is because I want genuine equality.

2304
01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:14.001
You know,

2305
01:07:14.001 --> 01:07:16.700
you see cases where racial profiling does exist,

2306
01:07:16.850 --> 01:07:17.540
no doubt.

2307
01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:18.140
And you want to,

2308
01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:22.220
you want to raise awareness about that because you want society to progress.

2309
01:07:22.221 --> 01:07:25.760
You don't want to pretend as though these societal ills don't exist.

2310
01:07:25.761 --> 01:07:26.810
They do exist.

2311
01:07:27.170 --> 01:07:27.951
But at the same time,

2312
01:07:27.951 --> 01:07:29.360
you don't want to demonize people either.

2313
01:07:29.361 --> 01:07:31.730
You don't want to make blanket statements about all white people.

2314
01:07:31.731 --> 01:07:32.564
That's insane.

2315
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:33.381
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

2316
01:07:33.381 --> 01:07:35.720
I've heard some pretty ridiculous blanket statements.

2317
01:07:35.930 --> 01:07:36.700
Um,

2318
01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:37.533
but what's,

2319
01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:40.970
what's really important is that the,

2320
01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:41.301
the,

2321
01:07:41.301 --> 01:07:44.300
the idea of racism should be eventually it should,

2322
01:07:44.301 --> 01:07:45.260
it shouldn't exist anymore.

2323
01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:46.680
One day the,

2324
01:07:46.681 --> 01:07:50.600
it should come a time where that has been ironed out of the human culture.

2325
01:07:50.601 --> 01:07:50.801
We've,

2326
01:07:50.801 --> 01:07:51.740
we've beaten it down.

2327
01:07:52.010 --> 01:07:56.330
It seems like if you go back to a few thousand years ago when they were burning

2328
01:07:56.331 --> 01:07:58.220
people at the stake for various beliefs,

2329
01:07:58.370 --> 01:07:59.780
we've managed to get past that.

2330
01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:01.970
We've managed to get past killing neighbors.

2331
01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:02.301
You know,

2332
01:08:02.301 --> 01:08:05.840
the rival countries that were like a block away from each other in Europe.

2333
01:08:06.130 --> 01:08:07.550
We managed to get past all that.

2334
01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:11.360
I wonder if one day we're going to get to a point where we don't give a fuck

2335
01:08:11.361 --> 01:08:12.350
what anybody is racist.

2336
01:08:12.410 --> 01:08:16.910
I wonder if there's gonna be some economic evenness where it'll eventually all

2337
01:08:16.911 --> 01:08:17.571
smooth out,

2338
01:08:17.571 --> 01:08:18.440
where it won't matter.

2339
01:08:19.270 --> 01:08:20.830
<v 2>I wonder the same thing.</v>

2340
01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:22.600
I'm not as optimistic about it though,

2341
01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:23.500
to be honest.

2342
01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:24.610
<v 0>I'm pretty optimistic.</v>

2343
01:08:24.790 --> 01:08:25.300
You are.

2344
01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:25.431
Yeah.

2345
01:08:25.431 --> 01:08:26.141
I didn't use to be,

2346
01:08:26.141 --> 01:08:27.370
but as time's gone on,

2347
01:08:27.410 --> 01:08:27.820
um,

2348
01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:28.150
uh,

2349
01:08:28.150 --> 01:08:32.280
the Internet is what makes me optimistic when I see like justice and,

2350
01:08:32.281 --> 01:08:33.820
and the voice of the Internet,

2351
01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:34.370
it's,

2352
01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:35.590
it seems to be a very ethical,

2353
01:08:35.591 --> 01:08:36.430
moral voice.

2354
01:08:36.610 --> 01:08:37.720
<v 2>What do you think about,</v>

2355
01:08:37.750 --> 01:08:38.051
you know,

2356
01:08:38.051 --> 01:08:40.480
some of the vigilante justice that you see online?

2357
01:08:40.481 --> 01:08:41.570
Like in the case of this,

2358
01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:42.040
uh,

2359
01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:44.890
the Steubenville rape case and how anonymous,

2360
01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:45.191
you know,

2361
01:08:45.191 --> 01:08:47.380
kind of rallied behind that victim.

2362
01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:49.430
I thought that was really inspiring even.

2363
01:08:49.930 --> 01:08:50.290
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

2364
01:08:50.290 --> 01:08:51.280
it's huge that,

2365
01:08:51.310 --> 01:08:51.521
that,

2366
01:08:51.521 --> 01:08:52.840
that stuff has to happen.

2367
01:08:52.930 --> 01:08:53.141
That's,

2368
01:08:53.141 --> 01:08:53.831
it has to happen.

2369
01:08:53.831 --> 01:08:56.290
You can't let people do that because that could be your daughter.

2370
01:08:56.291 --> 01:08:57.160
That could be your friend,

2371
01:08:57.161 --> 01:08:58.120
that could be your mom,

2372
01:08:58.121 --> 01:08:58.990
that could be anybody.

2373
01:08:58.991 --> 01:09:02.590
You can't let that happen and they can't let that fucking happen either.

2374
01:09:02.591 --> 01:09:04.000
That the fact that they let that happen,

2375
01:09:04.001 --> 01:09:05.470
you've got to clean that whole place out.

2376
01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:06.700
That's a disaster,

2377
01:09:06.730 --> 01:09:06.911
right?

2378
01:09:06.911 --> 01:09:08.380
Anybody who's involved in that,

2379
01:09:08.530 --> 01:09:09.730
what did you do?

2380
01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:11.230
What the fuck did you do?

2381
01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:11.540
You,

2382
01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:14.590
you just opened the door for this kind of shit to be swept under the rug by

2383
01:09:14.591 --> 01:09:17.110
future generations who find out about this as well.

2384
01:09:17.111 --> 01:09:18.020
This is like when,

2385
01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:21.100
when there's a gross injustice and it's,

2386
01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:22.690
and it doesn't get rectified,

2387
01:09:23.110 --> 01:09:23.411
there's,

2388
01:09:23.411 --> 01:09:27.070
there's this weird thing that happens where can spawn more gross injustice.

2389
01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:27.441
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

2390
01:09:27.441 --> 01:09:31.790
I mean it sets a precedent and if one person can get away with doing that type

2391
01:09:31.791 --> 01:09:32.510
of,

2392
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:32.810
you know,

2393
01:09:32.810 --> 01:09:35.420
act or behaving in a certain way,

2394
01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:36.860
then other people will think like,

2395
01:09:36.861 --> 01:09:38.210
well I can do that.

2396
01:09:38.211 --> 01:09:39.200
I can get away with that.

2397
01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:39.951
And you know,

2398
01:09:39.951 --> 01:09:42.890
in the case of the Steubenville rape case,

2399
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:47.950
I w I was actually really shocked at how many people bullied the girl after she

2400
01:09:50.211 --> 01:09:50.900
was raped.

2401
01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:54.330
And you see more and more stories like that popping up all over the place.

2402
01:09:54.331 --> 01:09:54.480
Right.

2403
01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:58.460
<v 0>Think it's a human nature issue with a lot of young kids that have not been,</v>

2404
01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:00.920
not only not have not been raised correctly,

2405
01:10:00.921 --> 01:10:03.770
but I think there's a lot of people that are just learning their kids,

2406
01:10:03.771 --> 01:10:06.440
raising themselves and then not even having conversations with them and they're

2407
01:10:06.441 --> 01:10:11.060
growing up with like animal instincts and the animal instincts are the go after

2408
01:10:11.061 --> 01:10:11.871
injured animals.

2409
01:10:11.871 --> 01:10:12.920
There's a weird thing.

2410
01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:13.843
It's scary,

2411
01:10:13.970 --> 01:10:14.781
terrifying thing,

2412
01:10:14.781 --> 01:10:18.680
especially when the injured animal is claiming that the Alpha,

2413
01:10:18.681 --> 01:10:20.540
the Social Alphas have,

2414
01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:22.040
have done this thing to them.

2415
01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:22.581
You know,

2416
01:10:22.581 --> 01:10:24.560
and then the Social Alphas is saying they didn't do it.

2417
01:10:24.561 --> 01:10:26.270
And then there's this weird sort of,

2418
01:10:26.271 --> 01:10:26.630
uh,

2419
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:30.290
an appeasement thing going on where people are trying to gain the favor of the

2420
01:10:30.291 --> 01:10:32.510
Alphas by shitting on the victim.

2421
01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:34.250
It's terrifying stuff.

2422
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:38.360
It's the worst aspects of humankind is this weird thing that we can have when we

2423
01:10:38.361 --> 01:10:39.194
gang up,

2424
01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:39.980
you know,

2425
01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:40.200
<v 2>and,</v>

2426
01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:41.730
and the parents of the victim,

2427
01:10:41.731 --> 01:10:44.370
I give them all the credit in the world because I'm going to be completely

2428
01:10:44.371 --> 01:10:44.821
honest.

2429
01:10:44.821 --> 01:10:46.320
If I were in that position,

2430
01:10:46.650 --> 01:10:50.730
I don't know if I would be able to prevent myself from doing something that

2431
01:10:50.731 --> 01:10:51.270
would,

2432
01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:55.770
that would lead me to getting prosecuted and thrown in jail.

2433
01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:56.823
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

2434
01:10:57.070 --> 01:10:57.903
It's um,

2435
01:10:58.390 --> 01:11:00.130
something happens to men.

2436
01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:00.850
The,

2437
01:11:00.850 --> 01:11:04.510
the get together and have a bunch of idiot men get together.

2438
01:11:04.511 --> 01:11:06.730
They think that that that's something that they can do.

2439
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:08.000
And it's a,

2440
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:10.100
<v 2>and in the case of Steubenville,</v>

2441
01:11:10.101 --> 01:11:10.761
they're boys,

2442
01:11:10.761 --> 01:11:12.860
they're teenagers and they think they can get away with it.

2443
01:11:12.890 --> 01:11:13.020
Well,

2444
01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:14.190
it's just men period.

2445
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:14.491
<v 0>I mean,</v>

2446
01:11:14.491 --> 01:11:15.270
young men,

2447
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:16.103
old men,

2448
01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:16.621
there's a,

2449
01:11:16.621 --> 01:11:16.951
there's,

2450
01:11:16.951 --> 01:11:20.970
there's a man thing that can happen if there's too many dummies and they get

2451
01:11:20.971 --> 01:11:22.710
together and they start thinking that they,

2452
01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:24.270
they're making sense or that they could,

2453
01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.740
she just focus full could do this.

2454
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.720
And that's where like gang murders take place and gang beatings and you know,

2455
01:11:30.721 --> 01:11:30.981
I'm,

2456
01:11:30.981 --> 01:11:35.010
I'm sure there's a similar sort of group mentality that happens with women,

2457
01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:38.370
but it doesn't seem to turn into as much of a victimization thing.

2458
01:11:38.490 --> 01:11:39.181
It can happen.

2459
01:11:39.181 --> 01:11:41.220
I've heard of like groups of women beating up other women.

2460
01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:42.620
I've heard outside of that,

2461
01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:43.080
you know,

2462
01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:45.840
if a girl like fuck some girl's husband or something like that and she got her

2463
01:11:45.841 --> 01:11:47.310
friends and they all beat the shit out of the girl.

2464
01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:49.230
I've heard of that kind of stuff happening.

2465
01:11:49.290 --> 01:11:49.951
She's scary,

2466
01:11:49.951 --> 01:11:50.784
scary stuff.

2467
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:53.340
I've heard of stories of women raping men,

2468
01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:54.593
Blah.

2469
01:11:56.370 --> 01:11:57.203
Terrible.

2470
01:11:57.290 --> 01:11:57.720
Um,

2471
01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:59.460
you were talking about this on the podcast yesterday.

2472
01:11:59.461 --> 01:12:01.860
The problem with male rights organizations.

2473
01:12:02.210 --> 01:12:02.721
<v 3>Oh,</v>

2474
01:12:02.721 --> 01:12:04.700
you guys must have gotten some serious hate for that.

2475
01:12:04.730 --> 01:12:05.050
No,

2476
01:12:05.050 --> 01:12:05.261
<v 0>no,</v>

2477
01:12:05.261 --> 01:12:05.501
no,

2478
01:12:05.501 --> 01:12:08.110
because my point is always that,

2479
01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:08.411
yeah,

2480
01:12:08.411 --> 01:12:11.260
I mean there's a lot of dudes get fucked over and it comes to divorce laws.

2481
01:12:11.261 --> 01:12:15.460
A lot of the problem is when male rights advocates get disingenuous.

2482
01:12:15.461 --> 01:12:17.380
Like they were talking about rape issues.

2483
01:12:17.381 --> 01:12:22.381
There were saying the number one group that gets raped in this country is men in

2484
01:12:22.571 --> 01:12:23.404
prison.

2485
01:12:23.490 --> 01:12:26.200
The problem with that is of course that men are raping those men.

2486
01:12:26.650 --> 01:12:27.180
It's just,

2487
01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:29.380
it's more proof that men are cunts.

2488
01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:30.730
Men are raping men.

2489
01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:30.911
It's,

2490
01:12:30.911 --> 01:12:32.380
this is a stupid argument.

2491
01:12:32.381 --> 01:12:32.890
It doesn't,

2492
01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:34.630
that's the worst thing you should ever say.

2493
01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:35.600
You know,

2494
01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:37.240
you're just saying that we're just rapers,

2495
01:12:37.241 --> 01:12:37.690
we're just,

2496
01:12:37.690 --> 01:12:38.530
we rape each other.

2497
01:12:38.531 --> 01:12:39.251
We don't give a fuck.

2498
01:12:39.251 --> 01:12:39.371
Well,

2499
01:12:39.371 --> 01:12:40.204
rape anybody.

2500
01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:42.220
And that doesn't mean that men are victims.

2501
01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:43.690
Men are victims from men.

2502
01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:44.890
How does that support the,

2503
01:12:44.891 --> 01:12:46.570
the point that that's the real issue.

2504
01:12:47.050 --> 01:12:47.900
That's a really good point.

2505
01:12:47.901 --> 01:12:48.731
It's a dumb point.

2506
01:12:48.731 --> 01:12:48.941
Did they,

2507
01:12:48.941 --> 01:12:50.800
it's a disingenuous thing that they're saying.

2508
01:12:50.830 --> 01:12:51.100
Yeah.

2509
01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:54.220
Like guys aren't really wondering around life worried about getting raped.

2510
01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:56.110
They worry about it if they get imprisoned.

2511
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:57.560
<v 3>I just worry that,</v>

2512
01:12:57.561 --> 01:12:57.831
you know,

2513
01:12:57.831 --> 01:13:02.540
the men's rights movement is a response to like radical feminism.

2514
01:13:02.541 --> 01:13:06.950
And I have a lot of issues with radical feminism because when you pretend as

2515
01:13:06.951 --> 01:13:10.940
though women are always the ones that get screwed over and men don't deal with

2516
01:13:10.941 --> 01:13:12.950
certain double standards and certain issues,

2517
01:13:12.951 --> 01:13:14.810
then you're being disingenuous.

2518
01:13:14.850 --> 01:13:15.141
You know,

2519
01:13:15.141 --> 01:13:17.420
you're doing a disservice to your own movement.

2520
01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:17.811
I mean,

2521
01:13:17.811 --> 01:13:19.730
there are some serious issues with,

2522
01:13:19.731 --> 01:13:20.480
um,

2523
01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:21.950
the way women are perceived in media.

2524
01:13:21.951 --> 01:13:22.521
For instance.

2525
01:13:22.521 --> 01:13:22.701
You know,

2526
01:13:22.701 --> 01:13:26.360
the way I'm perceived in the media is very different from how Jank is perceived

2527
01:13:26.361 --> 01:13:26.841
in the media.

2528
01:13:26.841 --> 01:13:28.880
Very different from how you're perceived in the media.

2529
01:13:29.150 --> 01:13:29.600
You know,

2530
01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:31.880
the comments that you will get usually.

2531
01:13:32.190 --> 01:13:32.870
Um,

2532
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:36.500
we'll question the legitimacy or accuracy of something that you've said.

2533
01:13:36.650 --> 01:13:40.520
The Commons that I get don't necessarily criticize the legitimacy of what I'm

2534
01:13:40.521 --> 01:13:40.761
saying.

2535
01:13:40.761 --> 01:13:42.680
Of course I get comments like that as well.

2536
01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:44.840
But how often do you get comments about like,

2537
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:45.590
oh,

2538
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:46.010
you know,

2539
01:13:46.010 --> 01:13:49.830
I w I want Anna to sit on my face or I want Joe to sit on my face.

2540
01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:50.693
Like,

2541
01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:51.681
oh,

2542
01:13:51.681 --> 01:13:52.514
all the time.

2543
01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:53.353
Oh,

2544
01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:54.440
I stand corrected.

2545
01:13:54.441 --> 01:13:55.274
Then

2546
01:13:56.530 --> 01:13:59.300
some gay bear wants me to stick it in their mouth or something.

2547
01:13:59.330 --> 01:13:59.901
Oh Wow.

2548
01:13:59.901 --> 01:14:00.734
Okay.

2549
01:14:01.650 --> 01:14:02.241
That was happening,

2550
01:14:02.241 --> 01:14:02.571
you know?

2551
01:14:02.571 --> 01:14:03.090
But as

2552
01:14:03.090 --> 01:14:04.280
<v 0>much as I'm sure I remember,</v>

2553
01:14:04.281 --> 01:14:05.011
wouldn't even pretend.

2554
01:14:05.011 --> 01:14:07.350
I think that it's much more courageous.

2555
01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:08.910
I don't want to sound like I'm kissing your ass,

2556
01:14:08.911 --> 01:14:11.980
but it's much more courageous for a woman to do what you do than a man

2557
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:12.551
<v 4>to do what you do.</v>

2558
01:14:12.551 --> 01:14:13.690
For a man to do what you do.

2559
01:14:13.691 --> 01:14:18.691
It's like men with opinions or like is common as like birds at Shit on cars.

2560
01:14:18.990 --> 01:14:19.300
Yes,

2561
01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:20.020
they're everywhere.

2562
01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:20.481
This is Matt.

2563
01:14:20.481 --> 01:14:20.701
Every,

2564
01:14:20.701 --> 01:14:21.101
every way.

2565
01:14:21.101 --> 01:14:22.120
You look at man as an opinion,

2566
01:14:22.330 --> 01:14:26.710
but women with an opinion that go public and like have this like very strong

2567
01:14:26.711 --> 01:14:27.131
stance.

2568
01:14:27.131 --> 01:14:27.810
They take on things.

2569
01:14:27.810 --> 01:14:27.960
Yeah.

2570
01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:29.920
And expect to be taken seriously.

2571
01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:35.050
It's like female standup comedians because female standup comedians there was so

2572
01:14:35.051 --> 01:14:38.710
limited in topics cause men don't want to hear you talk about politics.

2573
01:14:38.711 --> 01:14:41.230
Men Don't want it to hear women talk about certain things,

2574
01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:42.160
you know,

2575
01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:44.890
like anything where you're telling people how to live their lives.

2576
01:14:44.891 --> 01:14:46.150
But I don't want to hear that from women.

2577
01:14:46.151 --> 01:14:50.140
It's just a giant group of men just shut you off much harder.

2578
01:14:50.170 --> 01:14:51.003
I think that,

2579
01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:51.640
<v 2>you know,</v>

2580
01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:54.460
younger generations are becoming way more open to that.

2581
01:14:54.461 --> 01:14:58.030
Like we have a really young audience and for the most part I think that they're

2582
01:14:58.031 --> 01:15:00.040
open to me talking about politics.

2583
01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:00.970
Um,

2584
01:15:00.970 --> 01:15:01.721
like I said,

2585
01:15:01.721 --> 01:15:04.810
I don't get to do that as often as I would like on the show because that's not

2586
01:15:04.811 --> 01:15:05.860
my role on the show.

2587
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:07.030
But there is,

2588
01:15:07.031 --> 01:15:07.670
um,

2589
01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:10.540
a huge chunk of our audience that's very open minded toward that.

2590
01:15:10.541 --> 01:15:11.141
However,

2591
01:15:11.141 --> 01:15:12.700
there's also a chunk of the audience,

2592
01:15:12.701 --> 01:15:15.250
and I'm just going based on what I've read on Youtube.

2593
01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:17.020
So there's a huge silence,

2594
01:15:17.050 --> 01:15:18.550
silent part of our audience,

2595
01:15:18.551 --> 01:15:19.630
and I'd never get to hear from.

2596
01:15:19.890 --> 01:15:20.140
Um,

2597
01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:24.610
but there is also a portion that just immediately sees me and thinks,

2598
01:15:24.670 --> 01:15:25.120
oh,

2599
01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:26.350
she's a young,

2600
01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:27.220
um,

2601
01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:27.731
whatever.

2602
01:15:27.731 --> 01:15:28.990
Relatively good looking.

2603
01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:34.080
And so they immediately see a correlation there with more chronic behavior.

2604
01:15:34.271 --> 01:15:34.510
Like,

2605
01:15:34.510 --> 01:15:34.691
oh,

2606
01:15:34.691 --> 01:15:35.411
she's attractive.

2607
01:15:35.411 --> 01:15:35.801
She must be.

2608
01:15:35.801 --> 01:15:36.020
Yeah.

2609
01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:37.330
<v 4>Well you had a free ride.</v>

2610
01:15:37.331 --> 01:15:38.040
That's what they think.

2611
01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:38.740
Oh yeah.

2612
01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:39.573
Oh yeah.

2613
01:15:40.140 --> 01:15:40.930
Golden ticket.

2614
01:15:40.930 --> 01:15:41.640
You're pretty,

2615
01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:41.881
yeah,

2616
01:15:41.881 --> 01:15:42.040
yeah,

2617
01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:42.240
yeah.

2618
01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:43.010
<v 2>So,</v>

2619
01:15:43.010 --> 01:15:43.280
um,

2620
01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:44.280
I'll get comments,

2621
01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:44.641
you know,

2622
01:15:44.641 --> 01:15:45.121
asking,

2623
01:15:45.121 --> 01:15:45.331
you know,

2624
01:15:45.331 --> 01:15:48.870
what kind of sexual favors I gave my male colleagues to get to the position that

2625
01:15:48.871 --> 01:15:49.410
I'm in,

2626
01:15:49.410 --> 01:15:49.980
how rude.

2627
01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:50.730
And it's,

2628
01:15:50.730 --> 01:15:54.810
and it's so degrading because obviously none of that has ever happened,

2629
01:15:54.990 --> 01:15:57.030
but it's to be little,

2630
01:15:57.060 --> 01:16:00.090
the hard work that I've put into my career really,

2631
01:16:00.091 --> 01:16:01.760
really grind.

2632
01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:02.651
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2633
01:16:02.651 --> 01:16:04.780
But what you're doing right now is you're feeding the trolls.

2634
01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:07.590
I'm feeding the fucking shit out of the trolls.

2635
01:16:07.591 --> 01:16:08.560
I know they loved it

2636
01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:11.220
because he brought in,

2637
01:16:11.410 --> 01:16:15.610
it's all the comments of you having sex with your boss in order to get your job.

2638
01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:15.761
Yeah.

2639
01:16:15.761 --> 01:16:16.840
Everything you said it all.

2640
01:16:16.841 --> 01:16:17.190
Yeah.

2641
01:16:17.190 --> 01:16:18.780
And how offended you were of that.

2642
01:16:18.781 --> 01:16:20.410
And then when it's raining control bell.

2643
01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:20.801
I know,

2644
01:16:20.801 --> 01:16:21.011
I know,

2645
01:16:21.011 --> 01:16:21.580
but to be,

2646
01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:22.810
to be absolutely honest,

2647
01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:26.740
I completely stopped reading comments so they can go ahead and write them as

2648
01:16:26.741 --> 01:16:27.491
much as they want.

2649
01:16:27.491 --> 01:16:28.350
I'm not going to read that.

2650
01:16:28.351 --> 01:16:29.890
Just fucked up right there sister.

2651
01:16:29.891 --> 01:16:31.030
You just open up the door,

2652
01:16:31.090 --> 01:16:32.520
the gates of hell do your thing.

2653
01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:33.700
We'll know your tone

2654
01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:36.933
and girls.

2655
01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:38.470
Everyone be kind.

2656
01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:39.281
Yeah.

2657
01:16:39.281 --> 01:16:43.330
There's a real problem with writing things down online and not having any social

2658
01:16:43.331 --> 01:16:43.571
cues.

2659
01:16:43.571 --> 01:16:45.160
And I like looking at you and say,

2660
01:16:45.161 --> 01:16:45.401
you know,

2661
01:16:45.401 --> 01:16:45.910
and uh,

2662
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:46.480
um,

2663
01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:49.240
I watched your thing on science and you know,

2664
01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:53.480
I just want you to know that your grasp of physics is a bit off and write this.

2665
01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:54.011
And you'd go,

2666
01:16:54.011 --> 01:16:54.210
Oh,

2667
01:16:54.210 --> 01:16:54.551
I'm,

2668
01:16:54.551 --> 01:16:54.851
you know,

2669
01:16:54.851 --> 01:16:55.910
I don't know shit about science.

2670
01:16:55.911 --> 01:16:56.680
And then you'd laugh.

2671
01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:57.320
Ha ha ha.

2672
01:16:57.320 --> 01:16:57.560
Yeah.

2673
01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:00.850
We both laughed together and that would be it be well that same guy and youtube,

2674
01:17:00.910 --> 01:17:04.600
there's fucking dumb bitch doesn't know shit about science because he is an in

2675
01:17:04.601 --> 01:17:05.141
front of you.

2676
01:17:05.141 --> 01:17:07.660
He's not talking to you again as a human,

2677
01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:09.220
it goes back to the whole anonymity.

2678
01:17:09.770 --> 01:17:10.130
The thing

2679
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:13.850
<v 2>that I actually worry about the most isn't even,</v>

2680
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:16.580
you know how my feelings are going to get hurt because who cares?

2681
01:17:16.581 --> 01:17:16.941
Like I'm,

2682
01:17:16.941 --> 01:17:17.990
I'm a public figure.

2683
01:17:17.991 --> 01:17:20.690
I need to have thicker skin and it shouldn't bother me.

2684
01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:23.840
I worry about like if I,

2685
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:27.920
if I meet someone I'm interested in and I'm dating him and then all of a sudden

2686
01:17:27.921 --> 01:17:28.461
he decides,

2687
01:17:28.461 --> 01:17:29.031
first of all,

2688
01:17:29.031 --> 01:17:31.670
if I meet someone I'm interested in and I tell him what I do,

2689
01:17:31.671 --> 01:17:32.451
he's going to Google me.

2690
01:17:32.451 --> 01:17:34.460
Like that's the world we live in at this point,

2691
01:17:34.461 --> 01:17:35.294
right?

2692
01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:38.450
He's going to Google me and he's going to read the like the hideous shit that

2693
01:17:38.451 --> 01:17:42.470
people say about me and then is that going to influence his opinion of me?

2694
01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:44.750
Like I worry about that kind of stuff more than,

2695
01:17:44.751 --> 01:17:45.710
that's hilarious.

2696
01:17:45.711 --> 01:17:46.544
Do you really?

2697
01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:47.720
I do.

2698
01:17:47.810 --> 01:17:48.411
I mean there are,

2699
01:17:48.411 --> 01:17:49.244
I mean

2700
01:17:49.330 --> 01:17:51.160
<v 4>that would be the last thing that I would worry about.</v>

2701
01:17:51.190 --> 01:17:54.010
That's the very last thing that I would worry about is meeting someone and

2702
01:17:54.011 --> 01:17:56.230
having them be an influence by a Google search.

2703
01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:58.180
That's literally the last thing.

2704
01:17:58.670 --> 01:18:02.690
<v 2>I've been on the show since I was 20 and you want to know how many stupid things</v>

2705
01:18:02.691 --> 01:18:05.540
I've said on that show since I was 20 many.

2706
01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:05.850
Yeah.

2707
01:18:05.850 --> 01:18:06.750
<v 4>Well that's normal.</v>

2708
01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:07.190
It is.

2709
01:18:07.190 --> 01:18:08.160
It is normal.

2710
01:18:08.161 --> 01:18:10.170
Anybody that pretends it's not like you,

2711
01:18:10.171 --> 01:18:10.531
again,

2712
01:18:10.531 --> 01:18:11.850
you're just weeding out assholes.

2713
01:18:12.010 --> 01:18:15.450
I that anybody that pretends it's not normal to say something stupid when you're

2714
01:18:15.451 --> 01:18:18.780
20 and you're on a show that permanently records it.

2715
01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:19.830
My God,

2716
01:18:20.010 --> 01:18:23.370
if I ever got permanently recorded when I was 20 Oh,

2717
01:18:23.590 --> 01:18:24.930
in jail for hate crimes,

2718
01:18:24.931 --> 01:18:25.980
just for my words,

2719
01:18:26.590 --> 01:18:27.480
retarded person.

2720
01:18:27.481 --> 01:18:28.740
When I was 20 I was two.

2721
01:18:28.741 --> 01:18:31.200
I think most people are fools when they're 20 of course,

2722
01:18:31.201 --> 01:18:32.340
you're basically a child.

2723
01:18:32.370 --> 01:18:32.911
Definitely.

2724
01:18:32.911 --> 01:18:33.420
You know?

2725
01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:34.250
Definitely.

2726
01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:37.350
There's no way that you should be held accountable,

2727
01:18:37.351 --> 01:18:38.184
responsible.

2728
01:18:38.250 --> 01:18:39.810
Anybody should ever stick it in your face.

2729
01:18:39.811 --> 01:18:42.510
Things that you did when you're much younger.

2730
01:18:42.690 --> 01:18:43.200
Yeah,

2731
01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:43.981
I agree.

2732
01:18:43.981 --> 01:18:44.461
I agree,

2733
01:18:44.461 --> 01:18:45.300
but it'll happen,

2734
01:18:45.330 --> 01:18:48.360
I'm sure will weed out a dummy that you want in your life anyway.

2735
01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:48.751
You're right.

2736
01:18:48.751 --> 01:18:49.890
That's a good way of looking at it.

2737
01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:51.090
The best way of looking at it.

2738
01:18:51.150 --> 01:18:52.320
You know who you are.

2739
01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:53.970
If that guy can't figure that out,

2740
01:18:53.971 --> 01:18:54.570
fuck them.

2741
01:18:54.570 --> 01:18:54.990
Yeah.

2742
01:18:54.990 --> 01:18:55.650
Yeah.

2743
01:18:55.650 --> 01:18:56.221
Look at me.

2744
01:18:56.221 --> 01:18:59.240
I'm like the new Oprah for women already.

2745
01:18:59.250 --> 01:19:00.083
The Oprah from men

2746
01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:02.520
giving out advice,

2747
01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:06.060
teaching people how to fuck the relationships up oily.

2748
01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:08.280
Oh God.

2749
01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:09.510
Do what you gotta do.

2750
01:19:09.690 --> 01:19:10.500
Yeah.

2751
01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:10.861
Yeah.

2752
01:19:10.861 --> 01:19:12.240
It's gotta be hard being a check,

2753
01:19:12.241 --> 01:19:12.840
trying to,

2754
01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:15.780
trying to meet a dude out there in the wonderful world of uh,

2755
01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:16.650
uh,

2756
01:19:16.650 --> 01:19:18.300
and also being like a public figure.

2757
01:19:18.690 --> 01:19:18.961
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

2758
01:19:18.961 --> 01:19:19.950
that's what I'm saying.

2759
01:19:19.951 --> 01:19:20.581
It is.

2760
01:19:20.581 --> 01:19:21.090
Um,

2761
01:19:21.090 --> 01:19:22.320
but whatever,

2762
01:19:22.590 --> 01:19:23.341
I think you're right.

2763
01:19:23.341 --> 01:19:23.551
You know,

2764
01:19:23.551 --> 01:19:26.490
you do weed out the assholes and you just,

2765
01:19:26.491 --> 01:19:28.560
you can't take yourself too seriously

2766
01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:30.470
<v 4>cause you can't date a regular dude either.</v>

2767
01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:31.550
You got a real problem.

2768
01:19:31.730 --> 01:19:34.430
What do you mean you're a little on the smart side?

2769
01:19:34.810 --> 01:19:37.370
It's a little on the little on the kids.

2770
01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:38.630
A little on the articulate side.

2771
01:19:38.810 --> 01:19:40.250
That's a little intimidating for guys.

2772
01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:41.211
And we're like,

2773
01:19:41.211 --> 01:19:42.044
you know what,

2774
01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:43.430
I'm not going to get shut down by this one.

2775
01:19:43.431 --> 01:19:44.270
I'm just going to pass.

2776
01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:45.170
I'm not even gonna try.

2777
01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:47.020
Do you get a lot of that where guys are going to try?

2778
01:19:47.021 --> 01:19:47.370
No.

2779
01:19:47.370 --> 01:19:48.203
No.

2780
01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:49.630
Hmm.

2781
01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:52.220
I think a lot of dudes probably go,

2782
01:19:52.221 --> 01:19:52.581
you know what,

2783
01:19:52.581 --> 01:19:54.470
this is never going to happen for really,

2784
01:19:54.471 --> 01:19:57.650
and then they just stopped talking to you as soon as we get intimidated.

2785
01:19:57.651 --> 01:19:58.580
But that's good too.

2786
01:19:58.581 --> 01:19:58.881
Right?

2787
01:19:58.881 --> 01:20:00.350
Then you weed out pussies.

2788
01:20:00.410 --> 01:20:01.243
Does it suck?

2789
01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:02.300
<v 2>No,</v>

2790
01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:02.661
I don't.

2791
01:20:02.661 --> 01:20:04.040
I don't want those posties I just,

2792
01:20:04.041 --> 01:20:05.780
I don't want those pussies to exist.

2793
01:20:05.810 --> 01:20:08.250
Like you have nothing to be shy or intimidated

2794
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:08.860
<v 3>about,</v>

2795
01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:10.340
like whatever.

2796
01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:11.191
Every,

2797
01:20:11.191 --> 01:20:13.320
every person can teach you something new.

2798
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:13.740
Right.

2799
01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:15.060
But I will assume that you date,

2800
01:20:15.090 --> 01:20:15.301
yeah,

2801
01:20:15.301 --> 01:20:18.480
they can teach you how you can get stock now.

2802
01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:19.021
No,

2803
01:20:19.021 --> 01:20:20.070
but I will say that,

2804
01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:20.520
um,

2805
01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:22.200
when you said you can't date a regular person,

2806
01:20:22.201 --> 01:20:24.280
I thought like you have to date another public figure out,

2807
01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:25.250
which I'm not interested.

2808
01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:26.010
No,

2809
01:20:26.010 --> 01:20:26.191
no.

2810
01:20:26.191 --> 01:20:27.110
I'm a bad motherfucker.

2811
01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:27.781
You got a date?

2812
01:20:27.781 --> 01:20:29.100
Some dude who's really smart.

2813
01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:30.120
Definitely.

2814
01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:33.100
I'm definitely turned on by too much work intelligence,

2815
01:20:33.650 --> 01:20:34.483
too much work

2816
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:37.880
that's just so rude thing.

2817
01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:40.110
Super laid back and you know,

2818
01:20:40.111 --> 01:20:40.921
low maintenance.

2819
01:20:40.921 --> 01:20:41.681
I actually am,

2820
01:20:41.681 --> 01:20:42.514
I'm not that bad.

2821
01:20:42.730 --> 01:20:44.020
<v 4>I wouldn't think you were high maintenance,</v>

2822
01:20:44.290 --> 01:20:46.470
but I would think that a woman who's a public,

2823
01:20:46.471 --> 01:20:46.661
you know,

2824
01:20:46.661 --> 01:20:47.320
and all Bolton,

2825
01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:48.153
all seriousness.

2826
01:20:48.250 --> 01:20:48.570
Yeah.

2827
01:20:48.570 --> 01:20:50.230
I would think that a woman who's a public figure,

2828
01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:52.710
a woman who is very articulate and intelligent and,

2829
01:20:52.711 --> 01:20:55.030
and it makes a living off of her opinions.

2830
01:20:55.210 --> 01:20:57.010
That's intimidated for a lot of dudes.

2831
01:20:57.070 --> 01:21:00.220
[inaudible] especially people that are not good at expressing themselves like

2832
01:21:00.610 --> 01:21:01.090
the,

2833
01:21:01.090 --> 01:21:03.340
what is the big thing with relationships?

2834
01:21:03.341 --> 01:21:05.350
It's the weird sort of,

2835
01:21:05.410 --> 01:21:05.700
uh,

2836
01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:08.560
expression dance that you do with each other.

2837
01:21:08.650 --> 01:21:08.831
Yeah.

2838
01:21:08.831 --> 01:21:09.190
You know,

2839
01:21:09.190 --> 01:21:09.700
how does,

2840
01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:11.740
how does she express when she's angry?

2841
01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:13.180
How do you express when you're angry?

2842
01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:14.590
Who does it kindly?

2843
01:21:14.591 --> 01:21:15.220
Who Does it?

2844
01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:16.720
Who's passive aggressive?

2845
01:21:16.750 --> 01:21:17.260
Yeah.

2846
01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:18.970
Who's intelligent when it comes to arguments.

2847
01:21:19.210 --> 01:21:20.500
Doesn't want to have an argument with you.

2848
01:21:20.530 --> 01:21:22.000
That's fucking rough action.

2849
01:21:22.001 --> 01:21:23.260
You argue on the Internet.

2850
01:21:23.470 --> 01:21:25.300
<v 3>I haven't had an argument with a guy in a while.</v>

2851
01:21:25.330 --> 01:21:25.721
Exactly.

2852
01:21:25.721 --> 01:21:27.010
The scared bunch of bitches.

2853
01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:28.720
No scared to say that.

2854
01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:31.210
I haven't put myself out there that much to be honest with you.

2855
01:21:31.211 --> 01:21:32.920
So I don't have too much experience with that.

2856
01:21:33.250 --> 01:21:33.671
Um,

2857
01:21:33.671 --> 01:21:38.080
I was in a really long term relationship and then now if just started dating,

2858
01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:38.860
um,

2859
01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:40.510
that's where the seventies music comes in.

2860
01:21:43.010 --> 01:21:43.540
No,

2861
01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:46.210
I started dating and then the dude at home,

2862
01:21:46.211 --> 01:21:47.044
here's this.

2863
01:21:47.190 --> 01:21:48.023
<v 6>Ooh,</v>

2864
01:21:48.450 --> 01:21:49.283
Ooh,

2865
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:50.250
Ooh.

2866
01:21:51.330 --> 01:21:52.530
<v 3>Trust me crying.</v>

2867
01:21:52.770 --> 01:21:53.011
No,

2868
01:21:53.011 --> 01:21:53.431
he's not.

2869
01:21:53.431 --> 01:21:53.970
Yes he is.

2870
01:21:53.970 --> 01:21:54.230
No,

2871
01:21:54.230 --> 01:21:54.461
he's,

2872
01:21:54.461 --> 01:21:55.800
he's a good guy on the inside.

2873
01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:56.251
Trust me.

2874
01:21:56.251 --> 01:21:57.084
They all do.

2875
01:21:57.450 --> 01:21:58.283
Me included.

2876
01:21:58.590 --> 01:22:01.800
We all clock on the inside [inaudible] phone.

2877
01:22:03.180 --> 01:22:04.013
I'm done with this.

2878
01:22:04.690 --> 01:22:06.770
<v 6>Ooh.</v>

2879
01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:07.100
The

2880
01:22:07.100 --> 01:22:10.140
<v 3>funny thing is I'm 100% certain he was going to listen to that.</v>

2881
01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:13.190
We're just fucking around man.

2882
01:22:13.191 --> 01:22:13.581
I know.

2883
01:22:13.581 --> 01:22:14.414
I know.

2884
01:22:15.170 --> 01:22:16.130
But I will say like,

2885
01:22:16.131 --> 01:22:16.401
I,

2886
01:22:16.401 --> 01:22:20.000
I live in like the gayest area of Los Angeles,

2887
01:22:20.001 --> 01:22:23.420
which means it's like impossible to meet guys near me.

2888
01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:24.440
Um,

2889
01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:25.273
and,

2890
01:22:25.370 --> 01:22:26.031
and you're right.

2891
01:22:26.031 --> 01:22:26.570
Like I,

2892
01:22:26.570 --> 01:22:27.560
I don't know what,

2893
01:22:27.561 --> 01:22:29.490
two weeks I love that we're playing for and music right now,

2894
01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:31.640
Jamie.

2895
01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:32.473
Yeah.

2896
01:22:32.810 --> 01:22:33.201
I don't know.

2897
01:22:33.201 --> 01:22:33.960
I'm just having fun,

2898
01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:36.230
but I'm not a problem in your neighborhood meeting guys.

2899
01:22:36.290 --> 01:22:36.711
Yeah.

2900
01:22:36.711 --> 01:22:36.921
Well,

2901
01:22:36.921 --> 01:22:38.240
I live in a gay neighborhoods.

2902
01:22:38.241 --> 01:22:39.950
So many guys who pretend to not gay.

2903
01:22:40.410 --> 01:22:41.990
I'm like trying to pick up chicks.

2904
01:22:41.991 --> 01:22:42.950
Yes I have.

2905
01:22:43.010 --> 01:22:45.080
But meanwhile they're really gay and they just don't want to grab it.

2906
01:22:45.230 --> 01:22:45.471
Okay.

2907
01:22:45.471 --> 01:22:49.070
So my best friend and I talk about this all the time,

2908
01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:49.580
um,

2909
01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:53.210
I've been on a few dates with guys that I'm 100% certain are gay.

2910
01:22:53.810 --> 01:22:54.260
Um,

2911
01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:54.920
and,

2912
01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:55.753
and it's like,

2913
01:22:56.150 --> 01:22:56.571
why?

2914
01:22:56.571 --> 01:22:58.520
Why are you trying to ruin my life right now?

2915
01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:59.870
Like what do you think is going to happen?

2916
01:22:59.871 --> 01:23:03.020
Like you think I'm not going to figure it out and I'm going to end up like

2917
01:23:03.021 --> 01:23:05.290
dating you longterm and then you're going to destroy life.

2918
01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:05.591
No,

2919
01:23:05.591 --> 01:23:06.070
you're gay.

2920
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:07.780
<v 2>I can totally tell how can you sell?</v>

2921
01:23:08.170 --> 01:23:10.240
You can just tell by the things and I'm not,

2922
01:23:10.241 --> 01:23:10.451
look,

2923
01:23:10.451 --> 01:23:12.070
I'm not trying to push stereotypes,

2924
01:23:12.071 --> 01:23:14.410
but when you're with a straight guy,

2925
01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:19.860
you just know like there's certain body language that indicates or implies that

2926
01:23:20.081 --> 01:23:22.270
he's like aroused or he's into you.

2927
01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:23.201
You know what I mean?

2928
01:23:23.201 --> 01:23:25.930
Like physically into you when you're like,

2929
01:23:27.890 --> 01:23:29.720
<v 4>if I was a Douche bag guy.</v>

2930
01:23:30.010 --> 01:23:33.650
So the way that the Douche bag guy translation to that is if you meet a girl and

2931
01:23:33.651 --> 01:23:34.580
she's not turned on by you,

2932
01:23:34.581 --> 01:23:35.900
she's a fucking lesbian.

2933
01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:36.530
No,

2934
01:23:36.530 --> 01:23:36.951
I know.

2935
01:23:36.951 --> 01:23:39.320
Cause you're saying that if he's not aroused by you,

2936
01:23:39.321 --> 01:23:40.270
he's gotta be gay.

2937
01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:40.761
Oh No.

2938
01:23:40.761 --> 01:23:42.160
That's not only where it is.

2939
01:23:42.170 --> 01:23:43.020
What it sounds like

2940
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:45.530
<v 2>sounds like that's not what I mean at all.</v>

2941
01:23:45.531 --> 01:23:46.100
It's just,

2942
01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:50.030
it's hard to explain unless you're sitting there on that date with me.

2943
01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:52.990
<v 4>Is it like when he talked to a black eye on the phone and even if you're super</v>

2944
01:23:52.991 --> 01:23:53.471
educated,

2945
01:23:53.471 --> 01:23:54.430
you still know he's black.

2946
01:23:55.180 --> 01:23:55.930
You're terrible.

2947
01:23:55.930 --> 01:23:56.740
That's real.

2948
01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:57.760
That's some real shit.

2949
01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.590
I've talked to a lot of black guys on the phone where they were very articulate,

2950
01:24:02.591 --> 01:24:03.460
very intelligent,

2951
01:24:03.461 --> 01:24:04.241
very educated,

2952
01:24:04.241 --> 01:24:05.110
but I knew there were black.

2953
01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:06.970
That's not a bad thing.

2954
01:24:07.150 --> 01:24:07.450
Yeah.

2955
01:24:07.450 --> 01:24:08.770
It's not bad to be black.

2956
01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:09.673
It's nothing wrong.

2957
01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:10.900
I don't know what that means.

2958
01:24:10.901 --> 01:24:12.400
Like how dare you?

2959
01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:14.530
How dare you bullshit me.

2960
01:24:15.810 --> 01:24:18.120
National Internet program such as this,

2961
01:24:18.130 --> 01:24:18.731
you know,

2962
01:24:18.731 --> 01:24:20.200
I know and everybody listens to this,

2963
01:24:20.201 --> 01:24:22.330
including black people that might pretend to be offended.

2964
01:24:22.570 --> 01:24:23.680
You know what the Fuck I'm saying?

2965
01:24:23.890 --> 01:24:24.670
Listen to me,

2966
01:24:24.670 --> 01:24:27.010
there's zero wrong with being black.

2967
01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:28.480
Absolutely nothing.

2968
01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:30.970
I am the least racist person you will ever meet.

2969
01:24:31.390 --> 01:24:33.430
I hope I have zero racism in me,

2970
01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:35.830
so I don't think it's possible to get any less racist.

2971
01:24:36.010 --> 01:24:36.880
However,

2972
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:39.880
I am a person that likes to look at reality.

2973
01:24:40.090 --> 01:24:44.500
I think it's interesting to find what people do and don't get offended at and

2974
01:24:44.501 --> 01:24:47.410
telling someone they sound black is not a bad thing,

2975
01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:50.680
but people sound black women and men,

2976
01:24:50.710 --> 01:24:55.030
I have talked to them on the phone and had wonderful elaborate conversations

2977
01:24:55.031 --> 01:24:55.900
that I truly enjoyed,

2978
01:24:55.901 --> 01:24:57.550
but I knew I was talking to a black person.

2979
01:24:57.790 --> 01:24:58.331
But why?

2980
01:24:58.331 --> 01:24:59.530
Because of their voice,

2981
01:24:59.710 --> 01:24:59.930
their,

2982
01:24:59.930 --> 01:25:00.081
their,

2983
01:25:00.081 --> 01:25:00.291
their,

2984
01:25:00.291 --> 01:25:02.020
the way they express themselves,

2985
01:25:02.260 --> 01:25:02.960
the way their,

2986
01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:04.550
their languages use,

2987
01:25:04.551 --> 01:25:06.370
the way they though the,

2988
01:25:06.371 --> 01:25:08.080
the tonal quality,

2989
01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:09.730
the way they speak.

2990
01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:13.960
There's a certain way that black people speak that's slightly different.

2991
01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:16.120
White people can speak like black people.

2992
01:25:16.121 --> 01:25:17.740
I have been confused that way.

2993
01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:18.010
Yeah.

2994
01:25:18.010 --> 01:25:19.840
Where I talked to the dude and he was a wigger and I thought,

2995
01:25:19.841 --> 01:25:20.920
I'm talking to a black guy.

2996
01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:23.800
It turns out that I was just talking to a white guy that really wishes he was

2997
01:25:23.801 --> 01:25:24.210
black.

2998
01:25:24.210 --> 01:25:25.630
[inaudible] super normal.

2999
01:25:25.660 --> 01:25:25.780
Yeah.

3000
01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:27.640
That happens a lot and nothing wrong with it.

3001
01:25:27.641 --> 01:25:28.870
That's happened with a Chinese guy.

3002
01:25:28.871 --> 01:25:29.770
That was a freak out.

3003
01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:30.310
Yeah.

3004
01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:33.430
I was talking to the dude on the phone and then I met him in person and I'm just

3005
01:25:33.431 --> 01:25:33.551
like,

3006
01:25:33.551 --> 01:25:33.821
oh,

3007
01:25:33.821 --> 01:25:34.660
he's a Chinese dude.

3008
01:25:34.690 --> 01:25:35.830
Oh what the fuck?

3009
01:25:35.831 --> 01:25:37.010
I thought I was talking to a black guy.

3010
01:25:37.011 --> 01:25:37.670
It was weird.

3011
01:25:37.670 --> 01:25:38.060
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

3012
01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:38.930
that is interesting.

3013
01:25:39.290 --> 01:25:42.420
I'm going back to the whole gay thing because I want to um,

3014
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:43.850
kind of back pedal from what I said.

3015
01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:45.493
Disastrous.

3016
01:25:45.670 --> 01:25:46.250
Um,

3017
01:25:46.250 --> 01:25:46.560
look,

3018
01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:46.771
I,

3019
01:25:46.771 --> 01:25:51.560
I'm in a unique position because of where I live and also I'm in Los Angeles,

3020
01:25:51.561 --> 01:25:53.150
which means a lot of people,

3021
01:25:53.151 --> 01:25:58.151
a lot of guys take a lot of pride in the way they look and they are almost proud

3022
01:26:00.171 --> 01:26:02.480
of being overly feminine in some ways.

3023
01:26:02.690 --> 01:26:06.140
Like they like the moisturizer and they like the fancy clothing.

3024
01:26:06.141 --> 01:26:07.750
And so then in that case there,

3025
01:26:08.150 --> 01:26:08.860
they used to be called

3026
01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:09.670
<v 4>Metro sexuals.</v>

3027
01:26:09.670 --> 01:26:11.830
I don't know what the politically correct term is now.

3028
01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:12.520
Is that bad?

3029
01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:13.360
Is Metro sexual

3030
01:26:13.890 --> 01:26:15.540
<v 2>see how these terms are always changing man.</v>

3031
01:26:15.541 --> 01:26:18.750
Like sometimes do you think that it's a totally PC term and all of a sudden

3032
01:26:18.751 --> 01:26:20.250
someone will like send you an angry email?

3033
01:26:20.251 --> 01:26:24.270
Like how dare you refer to us as Metro sexuals but you know,

3034
01:26:24.271 --> 01:26:25.920
so I could be absolutely wrong.

3035
01:26:25.921 --> 01:26:26.551
And by the way,

3036
01:26:26.551 --> 01:26:27.070
I have been

3037
01:26:27.070 --> 01:26:30.810
<v 4>known at work for having terrible Gaydar so maybe I am wrong.</v>

3038
01:26:30.811 --> 01:26:31.080
Yeah,

3039
01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:31.280
but,

3040
01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:32.520
but there's just,

3041
01:26:33.090 --> 01:26:34.230
it's freaking tough out there.

3042
01:26:34.231 --> 01:26:35.064
I don't know.

3043
01:26:35.930 --> 01:26:36.763
I'll spell it out for you.

3044
01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:37.733
You're a hot chick.

3045
01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:38.820
If dues don't move,

3046
01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:39.840
you say they gotta be gay.

3047
01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:40.240
No,

3048
01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:41.073
that's not what I'm saying.

3049
01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:42.300
That's not what I'm saying.

3050
01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:44.460
You probably correct too.

3051
01:26:44.730 --> 01:26:46.040
And I'm not a super hot chicks,

3052
01:26:46.041 --> 01:26:46.874
so this isn't bad.

3053
01:26:48.090 --> 01:26:49.350
But that does happen.

3054
01:26:49.380 --> 01:26:49.770
Um,

3055
01:26:49.770 --> 01:26:52.230
there is a lot of gay dudes who try to pretend to be straight.

3056
01:26:52.231 --> 01:26:54.660
I think for society or for what have you.

3057
01:26:54.661 --> 01:26:56.670
They just keep it together as long as they can.

3058
01:26:56.671 --> 01:26:58.080
And then the fucking wheels fly off.

3059
01:26:58.410 --> 01:26:58.790
Yup.

3060
01:26:58.790 --> 01:27:00.990
And there was a guy that I used to work out with,

3061
01:27:02.190 --> 01:27:07.190
this guy used to work out this gym and he would talk about girls.

3062
01:27:07.530 --> 01:27:08.161
And the way,

3063
01:27:08.161 --> 01:27:12.180
the best way I could describe it is if I was speaking to you,

3064
01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:13.200
if you were French,

3065
01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:14.970
and I was saying the correct words,

3066
01:27:14.971 --> 01:27:16.770
but I had no idea what the fuck they meant.

3067
01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:18.233
[inaudible]

3068
01:27:20.130 --> 01:27:22.110
but obviously I don't know what the fuck I'm saying.

3069
01:27:22.290 --> 01:27:23.123
It's just off,

3070
01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:24.353
you know,

3071
01:27:24.650 --> 01:27:28.780
<v 2>rise the 40 year old virgin and how he was describing having sex.</v>

3072
01:27:28.781 --> 01:27:29.611
Do you remember that scene?

3073
01:27:29.611 --> 01:27:30.300
You see that movie?

3074
01:27:30.300 --> 01:27:30.460
Oh,

3075
01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:31.091
there was a funny,

3076
01:27:31.091 --> 01:27:31.601
he was like,

3077
01:27:31.601 --> 01:27:32.290
he was like,

3078
01:27:32.290 --> 01:27:32.861
oh yeah,

3079
01:27:32.861 --> 01:27:34.950
I remember when I like touched her breasts and they,

3080
01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:37.720
they felt like they felt like sandbags

3081
01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:41.860
and it was just so obvious that he had never had sex before

3082
01:27:44.890 --> 01:27:48.230
<v 4>that I was talking to just start talking about this interaction that you had</v>

3083
01:27:48.231 --> 01:27:51.560
with a woman in a nightclub and now this girl just came up to him.

3084
01:27:51.561 --> 01:27:53.510
It just started kissing him and making out with him.

3085
01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:57.230
And it was like the way he was saying it was like the worst,

3086
01:27:57.231 --> 01:27:59.870
like fake storytelling you can imagine.

3087
01:27:59.871 --> 01:28:00.051
It was.

3088
01:28:00.051 --> 01:28:00.381
He was like,

3089
01:28:00.381 --> 01:28:01.250
he was doing a sketch.

3090
01:28:01.251 --> 01:28:01.500
Yeah,

3091
01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:01.880
yeah.

3092
01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:03.170
But he was a beautiful man,

3093
01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:04.250
like beautiful,

3094
01:28:04.251 --> 01:28:05.540
like big tall,

3095
01:28:05.541 --> 01:28:06.740
perfect bone structure,

3096
01:28:06.741 --> 01:28:07.574
just handsome.

3097
01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:11.540
And he had this girlfriend that just always had this perplexed look at her face,

3098
01:28:11.541 --> 01:28:13.280
like just just look like,

3099
01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:17.570
like an explosion just went off like 30 seconds ago and she's trying to figure

3100
01:28:17.571 --> 01:28:18.680
out what the fuck happened.

3101
01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:20.300
Like that's how she would go everywhere.

3102
01:28:20.590 --> 01:28:21.530
Cause she was like,

3103
01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:23.480
he was like,

3104
01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:25.490
she was batting way over ahead with him.

3105
01:28:25.491 --> 01:28:29.540
He was at 10 and she was probably in the six or seven range and she was a little

3106
01:28:29.541 --> 01:28:30.530
on the overweight side.

3107
01:28:30.531 --> 01:28:30.801
It was a,

3108
01:28:30.801 --> 01:28:31.131
there was a,

3109
01:28:31.131 --> 01:28:36.110
it was a clear mismatch and it was just a gay guy who had this girlfriend but he

3110
01:28:36.111 --> 01:28:36.620
was gay.

3111
01:28:36.620 --> 01:28:36.981
I have,

3112
01:28:36.981 --> 01:28:37.760
um,

3113
01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:39.290
I can't believe I'm going to share this on the show.

3114
01:28:39.291 --> 01:28:40.610
My friends think it's so silly.

3115
01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:41.010
Okay.

3116
01:28:41.010 --> 01:28:42.930
<v 2>I have something called the mediocre guy theory.</v>

3117
01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:43.840
Um,

3118
01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:45.690
and the mediocre guy theory is,

3119
01:28:46.050 --> 01:28:48.480
do not date a guy who's overly attractive.

3120
01:28:48.510 --> 01:28:53.510
You're just asking for trouble because guys already have like this crazy

3121
01:28:53.881 --> 01:28:54.511
confidence.

3122
01:28:54.511 --> 01:28:56.220
Even if they're not very,

3123
01:28:56.221 --> 01:28:57.090
like they can't,

3124
01:28:57.270 --> 01:28:59.100
even if they're not the most attractive guy in the world,

3125
01:28:59.101 --> 01:28:59.934
usually there,

3126
01:29:00.330 --> 01:29:01.170
they're usually

3127
01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:02.650
<v 3>cautious.</v>

3128
01:29:02.650 --> 01:29:03.341
<v 4>Let me just point out.</v>

3129
01:29:03.341 --> 01:29:03.761
First of all,

3130
01:29:03.761 --> 01:29:04.590
you're Armenian.

3131
01:29:04.590 --> 01:29:04.860
Yes.

3132
01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:07.760
And Armenian dudes are fucking savages.

3133
01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:08.830
In what way?

3134
01:29:08.860 --> 01:29:11.020
They're the most aggressive guys on the planet.

3135
01:29:11.110 --> 01:29:11.291
I,

3136
01:29:11.291 --> 01:29:11.900
yeah.

3137
01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:12.190
Dudes.

3138
01:29:12.190 --> 01:29:16.630
We have a lot of Armenian fighters in the UFC and the fucking animals.

3139
01:29:16.670 --> 01:29:16.851
I A,

3140
01:29:16.851 --> 01:29:17.051
yeah.

3141
01:29:17.051 --> 01:29:18.040
I don't date Armenian guys.

3142
01:29:18.041 --> 01:29:18.850
Savages.

3143
01:29:18.850 --> 01:29:18.941
Yeah.

3144
01:29:18.941 --> 01:29:19.900
Those dudes are men.

3145
01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:23.560
Those are wild men with Harry chess who will punch you in the face.

3146
01:29:23.590 --> 01:29:24.790
They're fucking crazy.

3147
01:29:24.850 --> 01:29:25.683
Yeah.

3148
01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:28.033
<v 3>Right.</v>

3149
01:29:28.230 --> 01:29:29.760
Do you know how many people have asked me?

3150
01:29:31.290 --> 01:29:32.400
I've never lived in Glen Dale.

3151
01:29:32.401 --> 01:29:34.110
I've only been in Glendale like a few times.

3152
01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:36.420
I'm the most Americanized Armenian.

3153
01:29:36.421 --> 01:29:39.990
It would be nice to meet an Armenian guy who's as Americanized as I am,

3154
01:29:39.991 --> 01:29:41.970
but most of them are very traditional,

3155
01:29:42.270 --> 01:29:44.370
which means we're going to butt heads and I just don't,

3156
01:29:44.371 --> 01:29:45.960
I don't even have to wear that gold chain.

3157
01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:46.520
They're cross.

3158
01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:46.611
Yeah.

3159
01:29:46.611 --> 01:29:47.444
I don't play like it.

3160
01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:49.500
I don't play that game where the cross for Jesus.

3161
01:29:49.501 --> 01:29:49.860
Come on.

3162
01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:50.693
No,

3163
01:29:50.790 --> 01:29:52.650
so you're mediocre guy theory is,

3164
01:29:52.651 --> 01:29:52.891
yeah,

3165
01:29:52.891 --> 01:29:53.521
so don't,

3166
01:29:53.521 --> 01:29:58.050
don't go after a guy who's extremely attractive because he's going to get it.

3167
01:29:58.080 --> 01:29:58.471
First of all,

3168
01:29:58.471 --> 01:30:00.300
he's going to be constantly told that he's attractive.

3169
01:30:00.510 --> 01:30:02.730
He's going to constantly get attention from other women.

3170
01:30:03.090 --> 01:30:03.391
I don't,

3171
01:30:03.391 --> 01:30:04.530
I don't want to play that game.

3172
01:30:05.010 --> 01:30:06.450
Like I just don't want to deal with that.

3173
01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:07.313
You know what I mean?

3174
01:30:07.450 --> 01:30:08.150
So interesting.

3175
01:30:08.150 --> 01:30:08.530
Yeah.

3176
01:30:08.530 --> 01:30:11.250
Like what you just said right now about the guy who's out of her league,

3177
01:30:11.251 --> 01:30:11.790
right?

3178
01:30:11.790 --> 01:30:13.350
Let's say best case scenario,

3179
01:30:13.351 --> 01:30:15.750
he's not gay and straight couple or whatever.

3180
01:30:17.650 --> 01:30:18.340
Right.

3181
01:30:18.340 --> 01:30:18.780
Trust me.

3182
01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:19.110
Right.

3183
01:30:19.110 --> 01:30:22.920
But like you don't want to feel like the guy you're dating is prettier than you.

3184
01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:23.993
Wow.

3185
01:30:24.450 --> 01:30:25.400
It's really whatever.

3186
01:30:25.410 --> 01:30:26.243
Worry about that.

3187
01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:30.150
Would you ever really ever think that a guy would be pretty as a man is as,

3188
01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:32.730
as faithful as his opportunities.

3189
01:30:33.090 --> 01:30:33.421
Okay.

3190
01:30:33.421 --> 01:30:34.710
The believe Chris Rock joke,

3191
01:30:35.130 --> 01:30:35.941
it's not a joke.

3192
01:30:35.941 --> 01:30:37.560
It's might've been his joke,

3193
01:30:37.561 --> 01:30:38.640
but it's actually true.

3194
01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:39.990
Yeah.

3195
01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:43.770
Like if a guy is really attractive and he's constantly getting like bombed on.

3196
01:30:43.830 --> 01:30:44.340
Yeah.

3197
01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:46.260
Like women throwing themselves at him,

3198
01:30:46.261 --> 01:30:47.340
then he's going to cheat on you.

3199
01:30:47.341 --> 01:30:48.420
There's no question.

3200
01:30:48.450 --> 01:30:50.250
So you're better off shooting for the middle.

3201
01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:51.273
Yeah.

3202
01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:53.413
Um,

3203
01:30:54.030 --> 01:30:56.190
well the middle looks wise.

3204
01:30:56.610 --> 01:30:57.090
Yeah.

3205
01:30:57.090 --> 01:30:57.601
I want to look,

3206
01:30:57.601 --> 01:30:58.620
you've got a specific thing.

3207
01:30:59.070 --> 01:30:59.821
Looks are nice.

3208
01:30:59.821 --> 01:31:00.570
And by the way,

3209
01:31:00.570 --> 01:31:01.050
I'm sorry,

3210
01:31:01.050 --> 01:31:02.130
I'm just talking bullshit.

3211
01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:02.820
Like right.

3212
01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:04.920
I've dated really hot guys before like,

3213
01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:06.173
and whatever.

3214
01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:10.800
But what matters to me most is like the chemistry,

3215
01:31:10.801 --> 01:31:13.590
and I'm talking about intellectual chemistry,

3216
01:31:14.070 --> 01:31:15.420
physical chemistry,

3217
01:31:15.450 --> 01:31:17.190
like there's gotta be that connection.

3218
01:31:17.210 --> 01:31:17.490
Of course.

3219
01:31:17.490 --> 01:31:18.660
If that doesn't exist,

3220
01:31:18.661 --> 01:31:20.840
then I don't give a shit how good you look around.

3221
01:31:20.930 --> 01:31:23.310
Know that this has turned into the longest episode of the dating show.

3222
01:31:23.311 --> 01:31:24.270
Everyone I know.

3223
01:31:24.271 --> 01:31:25.110
Sorry about that.

3224
01:31:25.111 --> 01:31:25.191
Okay.

3225
01:31:25.191 --> 01:31:25.400
Those

3226
01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:26.233
<v 4>shows were great.</v>

3227
01:31:26.590 --> 01:31:27.560
They don't do those anymore.

3228
01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:29.900
Never have dating shows now because of stocking issues.

3229
01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:31.670
I remember they used to have those,

3230
01:31:31.700 --> 01:31:33.380
the dating game and you know,

3231
01:31:33.381 --> 01:31:33.891
people would,

3232
01:31:33.891 --> 01:31:34.220
uh,

3233
01:31:34.220 --> 01:31:37.280
they would be wearing those weird suits with the fucking bell bottoms and they

3234
01:31:37.281 --> 01:31:38.410
tell what they would do.

3235
01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:39.530
Bachelor number one,

3236
01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:44.060
if I met you and I was on a beach looking for shells and you wanted to get my

3237
01:31:44.061 --> 01:31:44.840
attention,

3238
01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:46.130
what would you say to be,

3239
01:31:46.300 --> 01:31:47.020
you know,

3240
01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:47.440
is it,

3241
01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:48.141
you claimed that,

3242
01:31:48.141 --> 01:31:48.974
I just know,

3243
01:31:51.130 --> 01:31:51.630
yeah,

3244
01:31:51.630 --> 01:31:52.760
those don't exist anymore.

3245
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:53.120
No,

3246
01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:53.950
I don't think they can.

3247
01:31:53.950 --> 01:31:54.140
Yeah.

3248
01:31:54.140 --> 01:31:56.390
I think it's too many legal legal issues.

3249
01:31:56.391 --> 01:31:56.660
Yeah,

3250
01:31:56.660 --> 01:31:57.980
there were super cheesy anyway.

3251
01:31:58.430 --> 01:31:58.761
Do you,

3252
01:31:58.761 --> 01:31:59.230
uh,

3253
01:31:59.230 --> 01:32:00.100
do you find

3254
01:32:00.610 --> 01:32:05.350
<v 3>that you meet guys like inside your community and like dating like a other</v>

3255
01:32:05.351 --> 01:32:08.560
reporters or journalists or people in that world?

3256
01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:09.800
Um,

3257
01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:10.580
yeah.

3258
01:32:10.580 --> 01:32:13.930
I mean there have definitely been some people I've run into where I'm like,

3259
01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:14.680
oh my God,

3260
01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:15.400
you know,

3261
01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:16.900
he's super smart.

3262
01:32:16.901 --> 01:32:18.160
He's a good looking guy.

3263
01:32:18.161 --> 01:32:20.950
Like we should probably go out of date or whatever.

3264
01:32:20.951 --> 01:32:21.784
He's gay.

3265
01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:22.780
No,

3266
01:32:22.780 --> 01:32:23.501
that's not the case.

3267
01:32:23.501 --> 01:32:23.980
I just,

3268
01:32:23.980 --> 01:32:24.970
I feel weird.

3269
01:32:24.971 --> 01:32:28.960
I feel weird dating someone that I work with or someone that I'm going to run

3270
01:32:28.961 --> 01:32:32.650
into often with my career because I don't want to burn burn bridges.

3271
01:32:32.651 --> 01:32:34.450
It might end disastrously.

3272
01:32:34.630 --> 01:32:35.560
So I just don't want to do that.

3273
01:32:35.561 --> 01:32:36.700
And plus on top of that,

3274
01:32:36.701 --> 01:32:37.060
I'm,

3275
01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:40.870
I'm more interested in dating someone who has a completely different career than

3276
01:32:40.871 --> 01:32:43.810
mine because I want to learn something from someone I'm dating.

3277
01:32:43.811 --> 01:32:46.900
We're very lucky Brian Redman is on here right now cause he'll be fucking

3278
01:32:46.901 --> 01:32:47.910
throwing himself out.

3279
01:32:48.870 --> 01:32:49.703
We'll do this year.

3280
01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:51.571
We're different.

3281
01:32:51.571 --> 01:32:52.404
We're

3282
01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:56.193
totally different.

3283
01:32:56.810 --> 01:32:57.540
Um,

3284
01:32:57.540 --> 01:33:00.790
you worry at all that with the stuff that you're doing that there'll be

3285
01:33:00.791 --> 01:33:04.240
repercussions the ever think like when the Michael Hastings thing went down,

3286
01:33:04.241 --> 01:33:06.000
did you guys freak out a little bit hoarse?

3287
01:33:06.090 --> 01:33:08.080
What did you think happened there for folks who don't know,

3288
01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:12.130
tell the story of what Michael Hastings did and then what happened to him?

3289
01:33:12.670 --> 01:33:17.670
Michael Hastings was one of the few real journalists left in the u s he was one

3290
01:33:18.221 --> 01:33:22.330
of the few journalists who actually gave a shit about holding politicians

3291
01:33:22.331 --> 01:33:25.840
accountable for their actions and he was so driven.

3292
01:33:25.841 --> 01:33:28.240
He was one of the most driven people that I've ever met in my entire life.

3293
01:33:28.241 --> 01:33:32.680
He made me feel like shit about my career on a regular basis because he was so

3294
01:33:32.681 --> 01:33:37.681
inspiring and so just hardworking and determined,

3295
01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:38.411
you know.

3296
01:33:38.411 --> 01:33:43.000
So he broke the story about General Stanley Mcchrystal.

3297
01:33:43.330 --> 01:33:43.811
Basically,

3298
01:33:43.811 --> 01:33:44.561
long story short,

3299
01:33:44.561 --> 01:33:46.900
Stanley McChrystal was saying some crazy shit about Obama,

3300
01:33:46.901 --> 01:33:49.090
basically criticizing him behind closed doors.

3301
01:33:49.470 --> 01:33:50.260
Um,

3302
01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:53.560
Michael Hastings wrote a rolling stone piece about it and,

3303
01:33:53.561 --> 01:33:53.690
uh,

3304
01:33:53.690 --> 01:33:56.620
the Obama administration forced McChrystal to resign.

3305
01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:58.870
So that was a really big story.

3306
01:33:58.900 --> 01:34:01.360
Michael Hastings won awards for it and you know,

3307
01:34:01.361 --> 01:34:02.530
that kind of put them on the map.

3308
01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:05.210
He wrote many great books and he,

3309
01:34:05.211 --> 01:34:07.000
he was just a great journalist.

3310
01:34:07.210 --> 01:34:10.660
But the most important thing to keep in mind is he was one of those people who

3311
01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:13.690
was fearless when it came to holding the government accountable.

3312
01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:14.111
Okay.

3313
01:34:14.111 --> 01:34:16.720
And you don't see that often then all of a sudden,

3314
01:34:16.810 --> 01:34:17.620
you know,

3315
01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:19.750
in June of 2013,

3316
01:34:19.751 --> 01:34:22.840
he gets into this really mysterious car accident at four,

3317
01:34:22.841 --> 01:34:23.201
I believe,

3318
01:34:23.201 --> 01:34:24.370
four 20 in the morning,

3319
01:34:24.371 --> 01:34:25.750
four 30 in the morning around then.

3320
01:34:26.170 --> 01:34:28.540
And he was speeding,

3321
01:34:28.730 --> 01:34:28.960
uh,

3322
01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:33.960
in the silver Mercedes and he crashed into a palm tree and the car exploded on

3323
01:34:34.601 --> 01:34:35.230
impact.

3324
01:34:35.230 --> 01:34:40.230
And everyone was wondering whether or not this was something that was basically

3325
01:34:42.281 --> 01:34:44.800
orchestrated by the government or if this was a real accident.

3326
01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:46.120
Now in terms of,

3327
01:34:46.121 --> 01:34:46.421
you know,

3328
01:34:46.421 --> 01:34:48.430
those rumors in the conspiracy theories,

3329
01:34:48.431 --> 01:34:52.120
I feel very irresponsible speculating one way or another.

3330
01:34:52.150 --> 01:34:53.350
I don't know what happened.

3331
01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:54.910
No one knows what happened.

3332
01:34:55.090 --> 01:34:57.040
All I do know is I worked closely with him,

3333
01:34:57.110 --> 01:34:57.831
the young Turks,

3334
01:34:57.831 --> 01:34:58.070
he was

3335
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:59.240
<v 2>on our show often.</v>

3336
01:34:59.510 --> 01:35:04.130
I cohosted a few episodes with him and I remember sitting in the makeup chair

3337
01:35:04.131 --> 01:35:07.460
getting ready to go on air when I found out that he had died in this car

3338
01:35:07.461 --> 01:35:08.294
accident.

3339
01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:11.120
And I've never felt the way I felt in that moment.

3340
01:35:11.121 --> 01:35:12.590
It was like a ton of bricks,

3341
01:35:12.591 --> 01:35:16.160
like had just fallen on me and I was just like tearing up and I couldn't believe

3342
01:35:16.161 --> 01:35:16.730
it.

3343
01:35:16.730 --> 01:35:19.220
And so I wanted to do an investigation.

3344
01:35:19.250 --> 01:35:22.520
We don't have the resources to do a full investigation into this,

3345
01:35:22.521 --> 01:35:26.840
but there were so many weird crazy aspects of it that didn't make sense.

3346
01:35:26.841 --> 01:35:27.290
Like his,

3347
01:35:27.290 --> 01:35:30.200
his engine being tossed so far away from his car.

3348
01:35:30.201 --> 01:35:31.610
The fact that the car exploded,

3349
01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:33.260
I contacted Mercedes Benz,

3350
01:35:33.261 --> 01:35:35.870
they refuse to answer any questions and I asked them,

3351
01:35:35.871 --> 01:35:36.111
I'm like,

3352
01:35:36.111 --> 01:35:36.440
look,

3353
01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:38.480
don't comment on the Michael Hastings Story.

3354
01:35:38.690 --> 01:35:41.060
Comment on what happens in your crash tests.

3355
01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:43.460
Is this typical of a crash?

3356
01:35:43.700 --> 01:35:45.380
And they would not answer any questions.

3357
01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:46.160
Um,

3358
01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:50.630
I tracked down the one witness that saw the entire accident from beginning to

3359
01:35:50.631 --> 01:35:51.464
end.

3360
01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:52.131
Um,

3361
01:35:52.131 --> 01:35:52.640
he,

3362
01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:53.540
he was Mexican.

3363
01:35:53.541 --> 01:35:54.680
You only spoke Spanish.

3364
01:35:55.010 --> 01:35:55.431
And,

3365
01:35:55.431 --> 01:35:55.550
uh,

3366
01:35:55.550 --> 01:35:59.300
we got a translator and he told us exactly what he saw and he said that Michael

3367
01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:01.010
Hastings was in fact speeding really,

3368
01:36:01.011 --> 01:36:01.844
really fast.

3369
01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:04.640
But that doesn't really answer any questions either because some people were

3370
01:36:04.641 --> 01:36:08.300
wondering whether or not the government can manipulate his car to make it

3371
01:36:08.301 --> 01:36:10.250
accelerate to the point where he gets into a crash.

3372
01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:10.910
I don't know.

3373
01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:11.121
Um,

3374
01:36:11.121 --> 01:36:11.361
I've,

3375
01:36:11.361 --> 01:36:13.130
I've read stories where it's possible,

3376
01:36:13.250 --> 01:36:13.941
but it's very,

3377
01:36:13.941 --> 01:36:14.900
very difficult to do.

3378
01:36:14.901 --> 01:36:15.501
So again,

3379
01:36:15.501 --> 01:36:17.060
I feel uncomfortable speculating,

3380
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:19.970
but what I do know is his family,

3381
01:36:20.030 --> 01:36:21.080
including his brother,

3382
01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:21.860
um,

3383
01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:26.120
have said that he was increasingly paranoid leading up to the accident.

3384
01:36:26.330 --> 01:36:27.530
He was unstable.

3385
01:36:27.650 --> 01:36:29.570
His brother was really concerned that he was,

3386
01:36:29.571 --> 01:36:29.960
um,

3387
01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:30.231
you know,

3388
01:36:30.231 --> 01:36:31.100
abusing drugs,

3389
01:36:31.101 --> 01:36:34.340
which is why he flew to Los Angeles to help him out.

3390
01:36:34.670 --> 01:36:35.211
His brother,

3391
01:36:35.211 --> 01:36:38.210
I think was the last person to see him prior to the accident.

3392
01:36:38.211 --> 01:36:39.710
At least that's what he's alleging.

3393
01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:41.630
And I,

3394
01:36:41.810 --> 01:36:42.200
again,

3395
01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:43.160
I don't know what happened,

3396
01:36:43.250 --> 01:36:48.250
but it did have severe ramifications for people who want to be investigative

3397
01:36:48.951 --> 01:36:52.730
journalists because if that fear does exist,

3398
01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:54.770
if that is even a possibility,

3399
01:36:55.010 --> 01:36:58.640
it's going to deter you from doing real investigative journalism.

3400
01:36:58.790 --> 01:37:02.480
It's going to deter you from holding the government accountable because you know

3401
01:37:02.690 --> 01:37:04.910
that the NSA is watching every fucking move.

3402
01:37:05.090 --> 01:37:08.690
You know that if you're watching the wrong kind of porn or if you're doing

3403
01:37:08.691 --> 01:37:10.490
something that's a little questionable,

3404
01:37:10.690 --> 01:37:10.931
uh,

3405
01:37:10.931 --> 01:37:13.880
according to societal morals and or norms,

3406
01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:17.210
then the government can find that and they can leak that to the public and they

3407
01:37:17.211 --> 01:37:18.890
can destroy your reputation.

3408
01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:23.210
Do you as a journalist want to take that risk to do what a journalist is

3409
01:37:23.211 --> 01:37:24.140
supposed to do?

3410
01:37:24.350 --> 01:37:27.530
And I think a lot of people out there are unwilling to do it and I don't blame

3411
01:37:27.531 --> 01:37:27.800
them.

3412
01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:31.380
It's scary to know that the government can come after you if they want it to.

3413
01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:33.050
That's all.

3414
01:37:33.050 --> 01:37:33.560
Also,

3415
01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:34.910
if this is what happened.

3416
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:35.420
Yeah.

3417
01:37:35.420 --> 01:37:37.350
And I'm not in again say that

3418
01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:38.000
<v 0>you're doing that.</v>

3419
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:38.833
Yeah.

3420
01:37:39.090 --> 01:37:41.830
I think that's really important because we really don't know what happened.

3421
01:37:42.250 --> 01:37:44.070
I looked at it when it first happened.

3422
01:37:44.071 --> 01:37:46.140
I was pretty freaked out too cause I was like wow.

3423
01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:48.210
And I thought about it for a minute and I'm like,

3424
01:37:48.211 --> 01:37:49.890
this guy was going after generals,

3425
01:37:50.130 --> 01:37:50.461
you know,

3426
01:37:50.461 --> 01:37:50.760
and the,

3427
01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:53.430
these are people who are professional killers.

3428
01:37:53.450 --> 01:37:55.410
They didn't kill him for the government for a time.

3429
01:37:55.411 --> 01:37:56.580
They know how to do it really well.

3430
01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:57.720
They have friends,

3431
01:37:57.870 --> 01:38:00.690
they can pull favors and they can make some shit happen.

3432
01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:02.160
I mean it is possible.

3433
01:38:02.190 --> 01:38:03.023
Did it happen?

3434
01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:06.540
It's also possible that the dude was doing drugs and he was going crazy.

3435
01:38:06.541 --> 01:38:07.720
But from the stress,

3436
01:38:07.780 --> 01:38:10.370
the trauma of this whole thing about seeing,

3437
01:38:10.410 --> 01:38:13.080
thinking constantly that the government's after you,

3438
01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:15.990
I mean that might be just enough to get you to fucking kill yourself.

3439
01:38:16.050 --> 01:38:17.160
It might not have to do it.

3440
01:38:17.161 --> 01:38:20.880
They might have to just scare you and freak you out and get you to believe that

3441
01:38:20.881 --> 01:38:24.360
they're watching every move you make and waiting for their time to lower the

3442
01:38:24.361 --> 01:38:25.020
boom on you.

3443
01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:25.590
Yep.

3444
01:38:25.590 --> 01:38:25.801
<v 2>And,</v>

3445
01:38:25.801 --> 01:38:26.280
and that's,

3446
01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:27.870
that's basically what I'm referring to.

3447
01:38:27.871 --> 01:38:30.870
That paranoia alone is crippling.

3448
01:38:30.871 --> 01:38:34.860
It was crippling for Michael Hastings and it's crippling for people that I work

3449
01:38:34.861 --> 01:38:37.830
with that want to do the type of journalism that he did.

3450
01:38:38.250 --> 01:38:41.250
And that's why I fear for people like Glenn Greenwald.

3451
01:38:41.251 --> 01:38:42.600
Glenn Greenwald is,

3452
01:38:43.110 --> 01:38:43.950
in my opinion,

3453
01:38:43.951 --> 01:38:44.784
a hero.

3454
01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:46.590
I look up to him so much.

3455
01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:49.170
He's the one who broke the Edward Snowden story.

3456
01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:50.490
He's the one who's,

3457
01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:50.791
you know,

3458
01:38:50.791 --> 01:38:53.100
revealing things that American should know about.

3459
01:38:53.310 --> 01:38:56.760
What frustrates me is a lot of Americans feel that someone like Edward Snowden

3460
01:38:56.761 --> 01:38:57.594
is a trader.

3461
01:38:57.630 --> 01:38:58.560
He's not a trader.

3462
01:38:58.561 --> 01:39:02.010
He's telling you about how your civil liberties are being violated.

3463
01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:04.500
This is the kind of stuff that should make people want to stand up.

3464
01:39:04.650 --> 01:39:07.680
Instead of having a discussion about what we should do to stop the government

3465
01:39:07.681 --> 01:39:08.880
from spying on us.

3466
01:39:09.060 --> 01:39:12.990
We're having ridiculous conversations about whether or not Edward Snowden can be

3467
01:39:12.991 --> 01:39:15.180
considered a trader or an American hero.

3468
01:39:15.420 --> 01:39:17.190
That is a stupid conversation.

3469
01:39:17.460 --> 01:39:17.821
Okay,

3470
01:39:17.821 --> 01:39:20.880
we know the information now we know what the government is doing.

3471
01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:26.120
The government is indiscriminately collecting our metadata and they are holding

3472
01:39:27.331 --> 01:39:31.650
this information for a period of time and they can use it to intimidate you if

3473
01:39:31.651 --> 01:39:33.870
you're a political activist or if you're a journalist.

3474
01:39:33.900 --> 01:39:38.640
That intimidation is what cripples our democratic process.

3475
01:39:39.060 --> 01:39:43.470
So I have a lot of problems with that and I worry that there aren't going to be

3476
01:39:43.471 --> 01:39:46.980
many journalists left that will do what Michael Hastings was willing to do.

3477
01:39:47.570 --> 01:39:48.290
<v 0>No doubt.</v>

3478
01:39:48.290 --> 01:39:50.450
And it was a huge price of this guy had to pay.

3479
01:39:50.451 --> 01:39:51.830
I mean he's living in Russia now,

3480
01:39:51.831 --> 01:39:52.461
hiding,

3481
01:39:52.461 --> 01:39:53.660
doing it work.

3482
01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:54.020
Yeah.

3483
01:39:54.020 --> 01:39:56.480
Learning how to speak Russian most likely if he lives,

3484
01:39:56.481 --> 01:39:57.830
he's going to be there for the rest of his life.

3485
01:39:58.070 --> 01:39:59.780
And what kind of crazy stress is he under?

3486
01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:01.140
Even imagine

3487
01:40:01.250 --> 01:40:03.790
<v 2>we had a hot girlfriend and a cushy job in Hawaii.</v>

3488
01:40:03.791 --> 01:40:04.380
He left

3489
01:40:04.380 --> 01:40:04.980
<v 0>that.</v>

3490
01:40:04.980 --> 01:40:05.490
Yeah,

3491
01:40:05.490 --> 01:40:08.640
it was a pretty pretty bold move and the,

3492
01:40:08.710 --> 01:40:10.170
the information that's come out,

3493
01:40:10.171 --> 01:40:12.750
it's really changed the way people look at the government and,

3494
01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:13.960
and how they're,

3495
01:40:14.370 --> 01:40:15.870
how they're handling privacy,

3496
01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:19.860
how they're handling this idea of the war on terror and what they're willing to

3497
01:40:19.861 --> 01:40:20.820
do and not willing to do.

3498
01:40:21.050 --> 01:40:22.410
They're willing to violate everything.

3499
01:40:22.411 --> 01:40:22.610
I mean,

3500
01:40:22.610 --> 01:40:22.681
they're,

3501
01:40:22.681 --> 01:40:25.370
they're willing to go against the very principles of,

3502
01:40:25.371 --> 01:40:26.204
of privacy.

3503
01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:27.780
Like every principle of,

3504
01:40:27.781 --> 01:40:28.660
of the,

3505
01:40:28.690 --> 01:40:28.861
the,

3506
01:40:28.861 --> 01:40:30.780
the idea that you're sending someone something,

3507
01:40:30.781 --> 01:40:31.591
you have a password,

3508
01:40:31.591 --> 01:40:32.260
you log in,

3509
01:40:32.260 --> 01:40:32.881
they have a password,

3510
01:40:32.881 --> 01:40:33.570
they log in,

3511
01:40:33.570 --> 01:40:34.440
you send them an email.

3512
01:40:34.441 --> 01:40:36.900
So if someone doesn't get in there and breach it,

3513
01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:39.960
you're thinking that what's going on here is a completely private conversation.

3514
01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:40.501
But no,

3515
01:40:40.501 --> 01:40:40.621
no.

3516
01:40:40.621 --> 01:40:42.270
The government gets to look at it.

3517
01:40:42.271 --> 01:40:42.751
Not only that,

3518
01:40:42.751 --> 01:40:46.800
but some fucking employee that they kept going on and on about how he never

3519
01:40:46.801 --> 01:40:48.180
graduated high school.

3520
01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:48.901
I remember that.

3521
01:40:48.901 --> 01:40:49.220
Yeah.

3522
01:40:49.220 --> 01:40:49.710
I mean there were,

3523
01:40:49.710 --> 01:40:52.530
there was shitting on him and trying to demean him by saying that need ever

3524
01:40:52.531 --> 01:40:53.500
graduated school.

3525
01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:54.040
Then

3526
01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:56.770
<v 4>why did you give them access to our private information?</v>

3527
01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:57.900
What's your hire him like?

3528
01:40:57.910 --> 01:40:59.190
Is that unbelievable?

3529
01:41:00.060 --> 01:41:01.230
I didn't graduate high school.

3530
01:41:01.260 --> 01:41:01.990
It seems crazy.

3531
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:03.190
And the worst part about it is,

3532
01:41:03.191 --> 01:41:03.371
I mean,

3533
01:41:03.371 --> 01:41:07.480
we have so many private contractors that have access to our private information.

3534
01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:08.280
It's fascinating.

3535
01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:08.520
Yeah,

3536
01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:08.780
it's,

3537
01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:10.090
it's a fascinating time.

3538
01:41:10.150 --> 01:41:10.900
And uh,

3539
01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:15.760
I think that we're moving closer and closer to some strange point in the future

3540
01:41:15.761 --> 01:41:18.850
where the idea of privacy is a thing of the past.

3541
01:41:18.910 --> 01:41:19.391
It's not,

3542
01:41:19.391 --> 01:41:20.320
it's nonexistent.

3543
01:41:20.650 --> 01:41:21.790
I think that's going to happen.

3544
01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:22.181
I don't,

3545
01:41:22.181 --> 01:41:23.320
I don't think you can avoid that.

3546
01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:24.310
I think that is without,

3547
01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:27.520
with whether it's a decade from now or two or three or whatever it is,

3548
01:41:27.850 --> 01:41:31.270
I think there's gonna come a point in time where the boundaries between people

3549
01:41:31.271 --> 01:41:33.760
and information or no law that no longer exist.

3550
01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:38.400
<v 2>I feel like we're going to get to a point where we will just be desensitized to</v>

3551
01:41:38.401 --> 01:41:39.780
all private information.

3552
01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:44.790
So the what people worry about most is like let's say you're not a politician,

3553
01:41:44.791 --> 01:41:46.230
you're just a political activist.

3554
01:41:46.650 --> 01:41:50.280
You might be worried that the government might use some information about you to

3555
01:41:50.281 --> 01:41:53.520
intimidate you and cause you to not be politically active anymore.

3556
01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:57.570
So it could be something like nude pictures of yourself that you emailed or it

3557
01:41:57.571 --> 01:41:59.130
could be the porn that you watched or whatever.

3558
01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:01.410
I feel like with the way things are going,

3559
01:42:01.411 --> 01:42:03.390
eventually we're going to get to a point where I'll,

3560
01:42:03.391 --> 01:42:06.600
all of our dirty laundry is just going to be out there and everyone's going to

3561
01:42:06.601 --> 01:42:07.020
be like,

3562
01:42:07.020 --> 01:42:07.680
oh,

3563
01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:08.340
all right,

3564
01:42:08.340 --> 01:42:08.970
whatever.

3565
01:42:08.970 --> 01:42:09.301
You know,

3566
01:42:09.301 --> 01:42:10.440
because you're going to be forced to,

3567
01:42:10.441 --> 01:42:13.750
there's going to be so much crap out there about everyone that you're just going

3568
01:42:13.751 --> 01:42:14.670
to have to deal with it.

3569
01:42:14.790 --> 01:42:15.031
<v 4>Well,</v>

3570
01:42:15.031 --> 01:42:16.020
that's going to be the future,

3571
01:42:16.021 --> 01:42:16.291
right?

3572
01:42:16.291 --> 01:42:19.230
That's like one generation from now or two generations,

3573
01:42:19.231 --> 01:42:22.710
whatever it is that those people are going to have no privacy from birth to

3574
01:42:22.711 --> 01:42:23.100
death.

3575
01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:23.491
I know,

3576
01:42:23.491 --> 01:42:23.730
I mean,

3577
01:42:23.730 --> 01:42:28.080
we're willingly were willingly putting our crop out there as it is with social

3578
01:42:28.081 --> 01:42:28.650
media.

3579
01:42:28.650 --> 01:42:29.161
Watson can,

3580
01:42:29.161 --> 01:42:30.180
I think it's a trend.

3581
01:42:30.181 --> 01:42:32.070
I think it's just like the technology trend.

3582
01:42:32.330 --> 01:42:35.430
I think we're moving in a certain direction and we don't,

3583
01:42:35.460 --> 01:42:37.110
there's no way you're going to stop it.

3584
01:42:37.111 --> 01:42:37.871
It's not like a,

3585
01:42:37.871 --> 01:42:39.540
a cultural thing like,

3586
01:42:39.870 --> 01:42:40.270
like,

3587
01:42:40.270 --> 01:42:40.790
uh,

3588
01:42:40.790 --> 01:42:43.530
different types of marriages are different types of,

3589
01:42:43.531 --> 01:42:44.100
uh,

3590
01:42:44.100 --> 01:42:44.730
you know,

3591
01:42:44.730 --> 01:42:45.630
tribal,

3592
01:42:46.230 --> 01:42:47.070
tribal government.

3593
01:42:47.071 --> 01:42:47.970
It's not like that.

3594
01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:49.680
It's way bigger than that and it's,

3595
01:42:49.681 --> 01:42:54.600
it seems to have a momentum all of its own and the momentum of information is

3596
01:42:54.630 --> 01:42:56.880
the ability to exchange it and share.

3597
01:42:56.881 --> 01:42:59.580
It gets quicker and easier constantly through time.

3598
01:42:59.670 --> 01:43:00.503
<v 2>It does.</v>

3599
01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:01.740
So you have,

3600
01:43:01.770 --> 01:43:02.041
you know,

3601
01:43:02.041 --> 01:43:03.090
you have two kids.

3602
01:43:03.660 --> 01:43:06.600
How do you plan on talking to them about social media?

3603
01:43:06.601 --> 01:43:07.980
Because I always wonder about that.

3604
01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:11.790
There are so many parents who like willingly put so much information about their

3605
01:43:11.791 --> 01:43:12.720
babies online,

3606
01:43:12.721 --> 01:43:14.160
which I find fascinating.

3607
01:43:14.370 --> 01:43:14.641
You know,

3608
01:43:14.641 --> 01:43:17.250
what kind of conversation do you think you're going to have with your kids when

3609
01:43:17.251 --> 01:43:18.540
it comes to oversharing online?

3610
01:43:18.541 --> 01:43:20.520
Cause I think that's an important conversation to have.

3611
01:43:20.990 --> 01:43:25.400
<v 4>It's definitely important to let them know that what they're doing can be seen</v>

3612
01:43:25.401 --> 01:43:28.400
by virtually every human being that exists.

3613
01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:29.291
That it's,

3614
01:43:29.291 --> 01:43:29.840
it's that.

3615
01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:30.800
It's at that point,

3616
01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:32.870
if you put something on a Facebook page,

3617
01:43:33.290 --> 01:43:38.290
essentially mean whether or not you get 14,000 hits or 14 billion,

3618
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.651
it's,

3619
01:43:38.651 --> 01:43:40.100
it's really the same thing.

3620
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:45.310
You're anybody that gets to that spot can get there and you got to realize that

3621
01:43:45.381 --> 01:43:46.880
like once you let it out there,

3622
01:43:46.940 --> 01:43:47.773
that's,

3623
01:43:48.020 --> 01:43:51.650
that's just this new weird connection where anyone can look your pictures

3624
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:55.760
<v 0>and if they're on Facebook they can comment and they could say weird shit and</v>

3625
01:43:55.761 --> 01:43:56.181
they can,

3626
01:43:56.181 --> 01:43:57.260
they can be lecherous.

3627
01:43:57.280 --> 01:43:58.310
They can be strange.

3628
01:43:59.540 --> 01:44:01.790
That's the reality of the world we live in now.

3629
01:44:01.810 --> 01:44:02.060
You know?

3630
01:44:02.060 --> 01:44:03.500
I think you would definitely,

3631
01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:04.880
especially for girls,

3632
01:44:04.881 --> 01:44:07.970
you definitely want to be very careful about what you share and what you don't

3633
01:44:07.971 --> 01:44:08.660
share.

3634
01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:09.080
I mean,

3635
01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:10.850
how many times you go into someone's Twitter page,

3636
01:44:11.060 --> 01:44:12.380
they send you a tweet and you go,

3637
01:44:12.381 --> 01:44:13.940
let me just read their tweets.

3638
01:44:13.970 --> 01:44:16.760
Like sometimes people say something interesting and I'll go read their timeline.

3639
01:44:16.850 --> 01:44:17.070
Yeah,

3640
01:44:17.070 --> 01:44:18.020
let's look at their pictures.

3641
01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:18.561
Oh,

3642
01:44:18.561 --> 01:44:19.430
there's her tits.

3643
01:44:19.580 --> 01:44:20.360
Like what?

3644
01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:24.440
It's amazing that not even a porn star girls just holding her tits out,

3645
01:44:24.441 --> 01:44:25.070
smiling.

3646
01:44:25.070 --> 01:44:26.420
Like I just don't,

3647
01:44:26.830 --> 01:44:27.610
the Internet

3648
01:44:27.610 --> 01:44:27.980
<v 3>get it.</v>

3649
01:44:27.980 --> 01:44:31.550
I don't know if that's like a societal pressure that they're caving into or if

3650
01:44:31.551 --> 01:44:32.171
it's just stupid.

3651
01:44:32.171 --> 01:44:32.340
Right.

3652
01:44:32.340 --> 01:44:36.930
<v 0>Maybe they just really liked Dick and they just want to comment in on a daily</v>

3653
01:44:36.931 --> 01:44:41.420
basis is a lot of shipments and the best way to show them what you got.

3654
01:44:42.220 --> 01:44:43.070
<v 3>I don't know.</v>

3655
01:44:43.071 --> 01:44:46.460
I deal with way too much like crap online to put myself out there like that.

3656
01:44:46.461 --> 01:44:48.530
There's no way in how I would,

3657
01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:49.850
I talk about this a lot.

3658
01:44:49.851 --> 01:44:50.031
You know,

3659
01:44:50.031 --> 01:44:53.750
every time we do a story about some teenager who like sex did a picture of

3660
01:44:53.751 --> 01:44:55.970
herself and then you know it got leaked online.

3661
01:44:55.971 --> 01:44:56.211
I'm like,

3662
01:44:56.211 --> 01:44:57.890
don't take naked pictures of yourself.

3663
01:44:57.891 --> 01:44:59.390
Just don't fucking do it.

3664
01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:01.370
Don't do it under any circumstance.

3665
01:45:01.371 --> 01:45:03.260
I have a strict rule about that,

3666
01:45:04.010 --> 01:45:05.420
so or do it.

3667
01:45:05.450 --> 01:45:06.050
Fuck it.

3668
01:45:06.050 --> 01:45:07.000
What are you worried about?

3669
01:45:07.010 --> 01:45:08.000
Don't worry about that either.

3670
01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:08.953
Well,

3671
01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:13.850
if you're comfortable with people like sharing your naked picture because you

3672
01:45:13.851 --> 01:45:15.350
send a naked picture to a guy,

3673
01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:16.880
he is over,

3674
01:45:16.881 --> 01:45:20.000
he's going to show it to his friends and then he might put it online and he's

3675
01:45:20.001 --> 01:45:21.140
going to destroy your life.

3676
01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:25.790
And the thing is we still live in that puritanical society where if that naked

3677
01:45:25.791 --> 01:45:27.140
picture surfaces at work,

3678
01:45:27.141 --> 01:45:29.030
you could lose your job as a result of that.

3679
01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:29.920
<v 0>That's ridiculous.</v>

3680
01:45:29.950 --> 01:45:30.190
Yeah.

3681
01:45:30.190 --> 01:45:34.840
Did you hear about the guy who got lost his job because he was mister t for

3682
01:45:34.841 --> 01:45:35.560
Halloween.

3683
01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:38.860
It was Toronto and I was like,

3684
01:45:38.890 --> 01:45:41.740
this country is going crazy and people like this isn't even this country.

3685
01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:42.371
I get it.

3686
01:45:42.371 --> 01:45:44.410
I know it's an expression.

3687
01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:44.890
He,

3688
01:45:44.890 --> 01:45:45.101
yeah,

3689
01:45:45.101 --> 01:45:45.881
I put on black face.

3690
01:45:45.881 --> 01:45:46.451
So they fired him.

3691
01:45:46.451 --> 01:45:49.060
He was a teacher [inaudible] he was trying to be mister t.

3692
01:45:49.090 --> 01:45:50.680
How could you be her t without blackface?

3693
01:45:51.100 --> 01:45:52.240
Like are you really saying this?

3694
01:45:52.241 --> 01:45:53.830
Is there something wrong with that?

3695
01:45:54.010 --> 01:45:55.420
He's wearing a fucking outfit.

3696
01:45:55.421 --> 01:45:59.140
It's not like he's putting on a minstrel show and sing and Mami and like got

3697
01:45:59.141 --> 01:46:00.910
like big fake lips and it's not,

3698
01:46:00.970 --> 01:46:01.181
no,

3699
01:46:01.181 --> 01:46:01.911
that's not what he's doing.

3700
01:46:01.911 --> 01:46:02.030
Yeah,

3701
01:46:02.030 --> 01:46:02.571
<v 3>I know.</v>

3702
01:46:02.571 --> 01:46:03.440
But look,

3703
01:46:03.650 --> 01:46:05.480
Canada might be a little different,

3704
01:46:05.481 --> 01:46:08.240
but black face has a really dark history,

3705
01:46:08.270 --> 01:46:09.950
especially in the United States.

3706
01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:12.150
You think if you play Mr t no I don't.

3707
01:46:12.650 --> 01:46:13.820
I don't think you should fire.

3708
01:46:13.821 --> 01:46:14.690
I do think it's bad.

3709
01:46:14.691 --> 01:46:16.160
I don't think you should get fired.

3710
01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:17.420
I don't think,

3711
01:46:17.420 --> 01:46:18.253
oh my God,

3712
01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:19.970
I don't think you should get fired.

3713
01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:20.630
Um,

3714
01:46:20.630 --> 01:46:21.560
but it's offensive.

3715
01:46:21.590 --> 01:46:22.251
It's offensive.

3716
01:46:22.251 --> 01:46:24.560
So I could still offensive for a Halloween costume.

3717
01:46:24.650 --> 01:46:25.483
I think it is.

3718
01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:26.673
<v 0>That's hilarious.</v>

3719
01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:26.861
Yeah.

3720
01:46:26.861 --> 01:46:28.930
What have you wear a red face and you'd want to be an Indian.

3721
01:46:29.380 --> 01:46:30.213
Can you do that?

3722
01:46:30.670 --> 01:46:31.420
Is that offensive?

3723
01:46:31.420 --> 01:46:32.500
But that's pretty offensive to,

3724
01:46:32.530 --> 01:46:32.711
okay.

3725
01:46:32.711 --> 01:46:33.610
What about yellow face?

3726
01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:35.700
<v 3>You weren't offensive to you be,</v>

3727
01:46:35.740 --> 01:46:37.790
why can't you be Mr t without the black face?

3728
01:46:37.990 --> 01:46:39.650
People are going to get the your mystery.

3729
01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:41.170
That's fucking ridiculous.

3730
01:46:41.690 --> 01:46:42.241
<v 0>Soul man.</v>

3731
01:46:42.241 --> 01:46:44.550
That movie where the Guy Wore blackface through the whole movie.

3732
01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:45.420
Remember that?

3733
01:46:45.420 --> 01:46:46.440
<v 3>I don't even know that movie.</v>

3734
01:46:46.441 --> 01:46:47.274
So

3735
01:46:48.350 --> 01:46:49.680
it was an old movie.

3736
01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:49.990
It's on

3737
01:46:49.990 --> 01:46:50.340
<v 4>his house.</v>

3738
01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:50.631
Yes.

3739
01:46:50.631 --> 01:46:51.100
He Thomas.

3740
01:46:51.100 --> 01:46:52.170
How'd you remember that guy?

3741
01:46:52.290 --> 01:46:52.651
Nope.

3742
01:46:52.651 --> 01:46:53.041
And See,

3743
01:46:53.041 --> 01:46:54.120
he was before your time.

3744
01:46:54.310 --> 01:46:54.540
See,

3745
01:46:54.540 --> 01:46:57.660
Thomas Howell was one of those guys who's like these major league movie star did

3746
01:46:57.661 --> 01:47:00.180
a lot of big movies and then just stop doing them.

3747
01:47:00.510 --> 01:47:01.620
He was in like,

3748
01:47:01.770 --> 01:47:03.540
he was way back in like the,

3749
01:47:04.740 --> 01:47:05.850
what's that out?

3750
01:47:06.050 --> 01:47:07.100
So what side out?

3751
01:47:08.420 --> 01:47:09.720
How the fuck do you remember that?

3752
01:47:10.490 --> 01:47:11.120
Dare.

3753
01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:12.060
But so man,

3754
01:47:12.140 --> 01:47:12.300
uh,

3755
01:47:12.300 --> 01:47:12.690
he was,

3756
01:47:12.690 --> 01:47:13.431
he was in the,

3757
01:47:13.431 --> 01:47:13.620
the,

3758
01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:15.750
the outsiders or what was the one with Johnny Depp.

3759
01:47:15.751 --> 01:47:16.890
And was it the outsiders?

3760
01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:18.353
Uh,

3761
01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:19.350
and uh,

3762
01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:21.420
he played a guy who,

3763
01:47:21.490 --> 01:47:21.780
uh,

3764
01:47:21.780 --> 01:47:23.310
wore blackface and like,

3765
01:47:23.311 --> 01:47:26.820
pretended to be a black guy for something like to get in college or something

3766
01:47:26.821 --> 01:47:27.654
like that.

3767
01:47:27.750 --> 01:47:28.583
And uh,

3768
01:47:29.140 --> 01:47:31.430
I mean through the whole movie he wore blackface.

3769
01:47:31.740 --> 01:47:32.430
So you think that's,

3770
01:47:32.430 --> 01:47:32.821
there he is.

3771
01:47:32.821 --> 01:47:33.654
He's black,

3772
01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:35.353
not hilarious.

3773
01:47:35.980 --> 01:47:37.290
A black guy in school,

3774
01:47:37.291 --> 01:47:38.124
in blackface.

3775
01:47:38.130 --> 01:47:39.470
This was like in the 1980s.

3776
01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:40.313
Look at this.

3777
01:47:40.710 --> 01:47:41.670
He's got a Jheri curl.

3778
01:47:41.671 --> 01:47:42.504
Wigan.

3779
01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:46.950
The standard is probably a little different in movies.

3780
01:47:47.550 --> 01:47:48.383
Mm.

3781
01:47:49.730 --> 01:47:50.070
More,

3782
01:47:50.070 --> 01:47:51.170
more real than Holloway.

3783
01:47:51.171 --> 01:47:52.004
And is that what you're saying?

3784
01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:52.531
No,

3785
01:47:52.531 --> 01:47:54.030
movies are not more real than Halloween.

3786
01:47:54.870 --> 01:47:55.190
It's,

3787
01:47:55.190 --> 01:47:55.600
look,

3788
01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:56.001
I just,

3789
01:47:56.001 --> 01:48:01.001
I think that given the history of blackface and given how offensive it is to the

3790
01:48:01.561 --> 01:48:02.490
black community,

3791
01:48:03.330 --> 01:48:03.960
why,

3792
01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:04.860
why go there?

3793
01:48:04.890 --> 01:48:07.320
Why I don't understand.

3794
01:48:07.321 --> 01:48:08.610
I don't understand the value of it.

3795
01:48:08.611 --> 01:48:08.851
Okay,

3796
01:48:08.851 --> 01:48:13.080
so you want to look even more like Mr t or whatever it like just it's fine.

3797
01:48:13.081 --> 01:48:14.880
You can do it without doing the blackface.

3798
01:48:14.910 --> 01:48:17.070
Given our history and given how offensive it is,

3799
01:48:17.071 --> 01:48:18.240
just move forward.

3800
01:48:18.450 --> 01:48:19.380
That's hilarious.

3801
01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:20.670
I couldn't disagree more.

3802
01:48:20.910 --> 01:48:22.140
I think it's just the outfit.

3803
01:48:22.350 --> 01:48:25.530
I think if you're really pretending that if you are a completely non racist guy

3804
01:48:25.531 --> 01:48:29.880
and you put some paint on that makes you look more like an African American,

3805
01:48:30.030 --> 01:48:31.980
that somehow you're doing something offensive.

3806
01:48:32.190 --> 01:48:33.030
I think that's silly.

3807
01:48:33.300 --> 01:48:36.570
I think the idea of a white person pretending to be a black person,

3808
01:48:36.571 --> 01:48:39.420
it's just as weird as the idea of a black person pretend to be a white person.

3809
01:48:39.421 --> 01:48:44.130
But who gives a shit if a black guy puts white face on and does that thing that

3810
01:48:44.131 --> 01:48:47.010
Dave Chappelle used to do when a show or pretend to be a white man reading the

3811
01:48:47.011 --> 01:48:47.810
news,

3812
01:48:47.810 --> 01:48:48.181
you know,

3813
01:48:48.181 --> 01:48:48.991
with white paint on,

3814
01:48:48.991 --> 01:48:49.830
nobody gave a fuck.

3815
01:48:50.210 --> 01:48:54.900
White people were not made flesh and discriminated against and freaking lynched

3816
01:48:54.901 --> 01:48:55.691
and murdered.

3817
01:48:55.691 --> 01:48:58.260
And did you see a pineapple XRS?

3818
01:48:58.290 --> 01:48:58.471
Is that,

3819
01:48:58.471 --> 01:49:02.370
what is tropic thunder tropic thunder with Robert Downey Jr when he wears black

3820
01:49:02.371 --> 01:49:03.210
face through the home movie.

3821
01:49:03.870 --> 01:49:06.270
I did not see that fucking beautiful movie.

3822
01:49:06.810 --> 01:49:09.300
He played a black guy in the,

3823
01:49:09.460 --> 01:49:10.410
in the entire movie.

3824
01:49:12.100 --> 01:49:14.490
A really interesting argument.

3825
01:49:14.810 --> 01:49:18.540
I might reconsider my thoughts on it based on,

3826
01:49:18.541 --> 01:49:19.860
based on where I stand now.

3827
01:49:19.860 --> 01:49:20.910
I just feel like,

3828
01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:21.961
look,

3829
01:49:21.961 --> 01:49:26.961
I feel really uncomfortable with it just just because how society would make fun

3830
01:49:27.211 --> 01:49:31.450
of black people by making white actors put the black face on and,

3831
01:49:31.451 --> 01:49:32.610
and you know,

3832
01:49:32.910 --> 01:49:36.690
mimic them and make them seem like they were morons and they were less than,

3833
01:49:36.691 --> 01:49:38.640
it just has such a dark history.

3834
01:49:38.850 --> 01:49:40.500
So if people find it offensive,

3835
01:49:40.501 --> 01:49:42.630
I'm definitely empathetic toward that.

3836
01:49:42.631 --> 01:49:44.820
So Al Jolson basically fucked up Halloween.

3837
01:49:44.850 --> 01:49:45.683
That's what you're saying.

3838
01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:49.300
Definitely that stupid black face and racist bullshit.

3839
01:49:49.810 --> 01:49:51.070
I think if you're racist,

3840
01:49:51.071 --> 01:49:51.904
you're racist.

3841
01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:52.391
I think.

3842
01:49:52.391 --> 01:49:53.410
And if you're not racist,

3843
01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:54.610
then there's no,

3844
01:49:54.670 --> 01:49:56.680
nothing wrong with pretending to be a black person.

3845
01:49:56.940 --> 01:49:58.150
If you're going to be it for Halloween,

3846
01:49:58.340 --> 01:49:58.991
it's one thing.

3847
01:49:58.991 --> 01:50:01.780
If you're like mocking black people in general,

3848
01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:02.501
that's offensive.

3849
01:50:02.501 --> 01:50:03.790
But you're a guy,

3850
01:50:03.791 --> 01:50:04.810
a specific guy.

3851
01:50:04.811 --> 01:50:05.740
You're mister t,

3852
01:50:05.741 --> 01:50:06.940
you got gold chains on your,

3853
01:50:06.941 --> 01:50:07.774
it's Halloween.

3854
01:50:08.290 --> 01:50:10.060
Do there's Dave Chappelle pretends to be a white guy.

3855
01:50:10.420 --> 01:50:11.590
Reparations for slavery.

3856
01:50:12.010 --> 01:50:12.581
Well today,

3857
01:50:12.581 --> 01:50:14.140
the first real racism right there.

3858
01:50:14.250 --> 01:50:14.770
Yeah.

3859
01:50:14.770 --> 01:50:15.150
Check.

3860
01:50:15.150 --> 01:50:15.400
By the way,

3861
01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:16.570
he doesn't want to wait at all.

3862
01:50:16.571 --> 01:50:17.404
He does it.

3863
01:50:18.210 --> 01:50:19.180
That was a terrible,

3864
01:50:19.181 --> 01:50:21.310
just as bad as see Thomas Howell pretend to be black.

3865
01:50:22.030 --> 01:50:23.020
Equally confusing.

3866
01:50:24.110 --> 01:50:24.850
It's funny.

3867
01:50:24.850 --> 01:50:25.271
I don't know.

3868
01:50:25.271 --> 01:50:27.400
I see your point though and I appreciate it.

3869
01:50:27.580 --> 01:50:28.480
I appreciate that.

3870
01:50:28.481 --> 01:50:29.380
Where you're coming from,

3871
01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:30.550
it's like why do it?

3872
01:50:30.551 --> 01:50:32.290
It's not worth it and it's not worth it.

3873
01:50:32.291 --> 01:50:32.501
I mean,

3874
01:50:32.501 --> 01:50:34.330
I wouldn't want to be Mr t for Halloween.

3875
01:50:34.331 --> 01:50:35.020
Yeah.

3876
01:50:35.020 --> 01:50:38.350
And a I see your point where it's different in a movie I guess.

3877
01:50:38.351 --> 01:50:40.510
But I don't think I would,

3878
01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:42.640
it wouldn't bother me if one of my friends was Mr T.

3879
01:50:42.641 --> 01:50:43.151
I wouldn't be like,

3880
01:50:43.151 --> 01:50:43.361
man,

3881
01:50:43.361 --> 01:50:44.530
you're fucking racist Bro.

3882
01:50:44.531 --> 01:50:45.580
You have makeup on.

3883
01:50:45.581 --> 01:50:46.414
You're racist.

3884
01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:48.061
<v 2>There was,</v>

3885
01:50:48.061 --> 01:50:51.810
there was a story about these two women in England or two girls in England and

3886
01:50:51.811 --> 01:50:55.470
they were dressed as the world trade center on fire after the attack.

3887
01:50:56.040 --> 01:50:56.700
And they,

3888
01:50:56.700 --> 01:50:57.840
and they had um,

3889
01:50:58.380 --> 01:51:03.380
people like little fake people jumping out of the costume and to add insult to

3890
01:51:03.961 --> 01:51:04.794
injury,

3891
01:51:04.950 --> 01:51:07.470
they were part of this costume contest and they won.

3892
01:51:07.530 --> 01:51:09.420
They won best contest or a bit,

3893
01:51:09.450 --> 01:51:09.811
I'm sorry.

3894
01:51:09.811 --> 01:51:10.644
Best Costume.

3895
01:51:10.770 --> 01:51:10.950
Oh.

3896
01:51:10.950 --> 01:51:15.950
So like what amazes me is how little people think these things through before

3897
01:51:18.181 --> 01:51:19.014
they do it.

3898
01:51:19.560 --> 01:51:20.430
You see what I'm saying?

3899
01:51:20.431 --> 01:51:21.264
Like,

3900
01:51:21.270 --> 01:51:21.750
I mean,

3901
01:51:21.750 --> 01:51:24.240
there are some things that you just do not mess with,

3902
01:51:24.241 --> 01:51:26.700
and that's a perfect example of something you don't mess with.

3903
01:51:26.910 --> 01:51:31.350
Especially considering that there are family members that lost people as a

3904
01:51:31.351 --> 01:51:32.490
result of those attacks.

3905
01:51:32.491 --> 01:51:36.600
Family members who saw their own family members jumping off those buildings,

3906
01:51:36.810 --> 01:51:40.740
and then you have these two dumb asses wearing the stupid costume,

3907
01:51:41.100 --> 01:51:43.170
kind of making fun of that situation.

3908
01:51:43.171 --> 01:51:45.210
It's just there's some things you don't mess with and that's,

3909
01:51:45.240 --> 01:51:46.610
that's a perfect example of it.

3910
01:51:46.690 --> 01:51:46.961
<v 4>Well,</v>

3911
01:51:46.961 --> 01:51:49.660
I think it's another example of really dumb people getting together and

3912
01:51:49.661 --> 01:51:51.610
convincing each other that everything's going to be cool.

3913
01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:52.540
Yeah.

3914
01:51:52.540 --> 01:51:53.041
Oh God,

3915
01:51:53.041 --> 01:51:54.160
it's such a great idea,

3916
01:51:54.220 --> 01:51:55.030
isn't it?

3917
01:51:55.030 --> 01:51:55.271
Look,

3918
01:51:55.271 --> 01:51:56.104
I have fire,

3919
01:51:56.170 --> 01:51:57.790
but apparently not amazing.

3920
01:51:57.980 --> 01:51:58.761
<v 2>Their little bubble.</v>

3921
01:51:58.761 --> 01:52:00.530
It was a great idea because they won.

3922
01:52:00.940 --> 01:52:01.151
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

3923
01:52:01.151 --> 01:52:04.150
You could pull that off if you lived in a small town in Alaska before the

3924
01:52:04.151 --> 01:52:04.830
Internet.

3925
01:52:04.830 --> 01:52:05.390
Yeah,

3926
01:52:05.390 --> 01:52:05.780
yeah.

3927
01:52:05.780 --> 01:52:07.120
When people didn't know any better.

3928
01:52:07.640 --> 01:52:08.290
That's true.

3929
01:52:08.290 --> 01:52:08.891
But now,

3930
01:52:08.891 --> 01:52:11.320
especially if that picture goes on Facebook or something like that.

3931
01:52:11.590 --> 01:52:11.891
Oh,

3932
01:52:11.891 --> 01:52:13.120
prepare yourself,

3933
01:52:13.121 --> 01:52:13.720
ma'am.

3934
01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:13.930
Yeah.

3935
01:52:13.930 --> 01:52:17.460
The avalanche of hate Asiana Airlines pilot costume,

3936
01:52:17.470 --> 01:52:19.870
maybe most offensive of 2013.

3937
01:52:20.080 --> 01:52:20.913
Who is that?

3938
01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:22.020
I don't know the story.

3939
01:52:22.030 --> 01:52:23.200
The pilots have crashed.

3940
01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:24.401
The pilots,

3941
01:52:24.401 --> 01:52:26.650
that plane that crashed in San Francisco a couple months ago.

3942
01:52:26.710 --> 01:52:27.543
What was there?

3943
01:52:27.790 --> 01:52:28.451
Oh,

3944
01:52:28.451 --> 01:52:33.451
they dressed as the pike just put on blood on their face and they were just very

3945
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:35.143
tasteless.

3946
01:52:35.740 --> 01:52:36.011
Oh,

3947
01:52:36.011 --> 01:52:36.844
okay.

3948
01:52:37.300 --> 01:52:37.841
Oh God.

3949
01:52:37.841 --> 01:52:38.020
They,

3950
01:52:38.020 --> 01:52:38.620
they touch,

3951
01:52:38.620 --> 01:52:39.610
<v 2>they just don't.</v>

3952
01:52:39.640 --> 01:52:40.181
Why?

3953
01:52:40.181 --> 01:52:42.480
Why are people so dumb?

3954
01:52:42.540 --> 01:52:43.373
<v 4>People are dumb.</v>

3955
01:52:43.650 --> 01:52:44.483
They're just dumb.

3956
01:52:44.820 --> 01:52:45.920
They to be shocking to,

3957
01:52:45.921 --> 01:52:46.040
they

3958
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:47.210
<v 0>want to be paid attention to.</v>

3959
01:52:47.390 --> 01:52:49.340
And if you go as like the hulk,

3960
01:52:49.400 --> 01:52:50.540
no one's going to give a fuck.

3961
01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:50.811
Yeah.

3962
01:52:50.811 --> 01:52:51.000
You know,

3963
01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:52.130
there's a million of those out there,

3964
01:52:52.340 --> 01:52:53.750
but if you go as this,

3965
01:52:54.110 --> 01:52:54.591
people go,

3966
01:52:54.591 --> 01:52:54.981
oh my God,

3967
01:52:54.981 --> 01:52:55.814
what are you doing?

3968
01:52:55.850 --> 01:52:56.930
And then they pay attention to you.

3969
01:52:57.560 --> 01:52:58.340
That's what it is.

3970
01:52:58.340 --> 01:52:58.790
Yup.

3971
01:52:58.790 --> 01:53:01.760
They just want to get a little shock just to get a little rise out of people.

3972
01:53:01.790 --> 01:53:02.600
Yeah.

3973
01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:03.433
It's true.

3974
01:53:03.530 --> 01:53:03.870
<v 3>Um,</v>

3975
01:53:03.870 --> 01:53:05.100
Julianna hough,

3976
01:53:05.130 --> 01:53:07.110
who was one of the dancing with the stars,

3977
01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:07.620
uh,

3978
01:53:07.620 --> 01:53:08.610
performers or whatever,

3979
01:53:08.611 --> 01:53:10.020
she dressed in black face.

3980
01:53:10.380 --> 01:53:11.190
And I feel like,

3981
01:53:11.190 --> 01:53:15.750
I feel like you should hold publics public figures to a higher standard because

3982
01:53:15.751 --> 01:53:18.540
I think you're more aware of this kind of shit.

3983
01:53:18.570 --> 01:53:21.270
Like more aware of the kind of criticism you're going to get.

3984
01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:22.193
You know what I mean?

3985
01:53:22.470 --> 01:53:23.131
Like your,

3986
01:53:23.131 --> 01:53:24.450
you're putting yourself out there,

3987
01:53:24.451 --> 01:53:25.620
people are going to see you.

3988
01:53:26.030 --> 01:53:26.370
And,

3989
01:53:26.370 --> 01:53:27.630
and so I,

3990
01:53:27.930 --> 01:53:29.760
I almost feel as though,

3991
01:53:29.940 --> 01:53:30.960
what is she supposed to be?

3992
01:53:30.961 --> 01:53:33.810
She's supposed to be one of the characters from orange is the new black,

3993
01:53:34.170 --> 01:53:35.490
I forget the character's name.

3994
01:53:35.930 --> 01:53:36.763
Um,

3995
01:53:37.650 --> 01:53:38.790
and she doesn't really look black.

3996
01:53:38.791 --> 01:53:39.690
She looks more bronze.

3997
01:53:39.691 --> 01:53:40.110
And I like,

3998
01:53:40.110 --> 01:53:42.960
she looks like she got a really bad fake Tan.

3999
01:53:43.560 --> 01:53:45.930
She went like to West Hollywood and got a spray Tan.

4000
01:53:45.990 --> 01:53:46.351
Yeah.

4001
01:53:46.351 --> 01:53:47.280
One of them real ones.

4002
01:53:47.330 --> 01:53:47.940
Yeah.

4003
01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:48.570
Um,

4004
01:53:48.570 --> 01:53:50.250
and so she was like,

4005
01:53:50.251 --> 01:53:50.581
what?

4006
01:53:50.581 --> 01:53:50.940
Oh my God,

4007
01:53:50.940 --> 01:53:52.020
I had no idea.

4008
01:53:52.021 --> 01:53:52.741
I apologize.

4009
01:53:52.741 --> 01:53:57.300
And she had this apology and like that I felt like was a little bit of a

4010
01:53:57.301 --> 01:53:58.140
publicity stunt.

4011
01:53:58.170 --> 01:53:59.370
That's my speculation.

4012
01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:00.531
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

4013
01:54:00.531 --> 01:54:02.830
Probably most likely we'll probably,

4014
01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:07.250
there's a lot of people are just dumb and that's not as dark as like one of

4015
01:54:07.251 --> 01:54:10.070
those bodybuilder women when they get that spray tan stuff like

4016
01:54:10.380 --> 01:54:10.700
<v 3>yeah.</v>

4017
01:54:10.700 --> 01:54:11.001
Really,

4018
01:54:11.001 --> 01:54:11.811
really dark.

4019
01:54:11.811 --> 01:54:12.644
Are you into that?

4020
01:54:12.730 --> 01:54:13.370
Oh yeah.

4021
01:54:13.370 --> 01:54:13.900
You are?

4022
01:54:13.900 --> 01:54:14.120
No.

4023
01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:14.953
Does it turn you on?

4024
01:54:16.100 --> 01:54:19.530
<v 0>Not into girls that would potentially kick my ass.</v>

4025
01:54:19.870 --> 01:54:20.340
Yeah.

4026
01:54:20.340 --> 01:54:21.480
Or be more manly than me.

4027
01:54:21.580 --> 01:54:22.030
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

4028
01:54:22.030 --> 01:54:26.320
My favorite discussions on this show usually center around like the appropriate

4029
01:54:26.321 --> 01:54:28.390
way a female body parts should look.

4030
01:54:28.391 --> 01:54:29.650
I don't remember who your guest was,

4031
01:54:29.651 --> 01:54:31.750
but you guys were talking about the appropriate look.

4032
01:54:32.140 --> 01:54:35.110
I know it was Jim Norton like it was Jim Norton.

4033
01:54:35.410 --> 01:54:36.243
Dirty bastard.

4034
01:54:36.300 --> 01:54:37.133
Yeah.

4035
01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:37.900
And uh,

4036
01:54:37.900 --> 01:54:41.110
that was after I was confirmed to come on your show and I remember talking to my

4037
01:54:41.111 --> 01:54:42.160
friend Christian,

4038
01:54:42.161 --> 01:54:43.690
who loves your show by the way,

4039
01:54:43.691 --> 01:54:44.471
Christian Lopez.

4040
01:54:44.471 --> 01:54:45.210
He wanted me to say hi.

4041
01:54:45.210 --> 01:54:45.360
Oh,

4042
01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:45.680
what's up?

4043
01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:46.460
There you go.

4044
01:54:46.460 --> 01:54:47.080
Um,

4045
01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:47.711
and I was like,

4046
01:54:47.711 --> 01:54:50.200
what the fuck did I just get myself into right now?

4047
01:54:51.590 --> 01:54:52.570
Give out a bad impression.

4048
01:54:52.870 --> 01:54:53.201
No,

4049
01:54:53.201 --> 01:54:53.771
not at all.

4050
01:54:53.771 --> 01:54:54.760
You're totally fine.

4051
01:54:54.761 --> 01:54:54.991
I'm like,

4052
01:54:54.991 --> 01:54:55.120
yeah,

4053
01:54:55.120 --> 01:54:55.701
<v 0>well we do.</v>

4054
01:54:55.701 --> 01:54:57.110
We do give out a bad impression.

4055
01:54:57.120 --> 01:54:59.870
If you wanted to cherry pick shit out of our past,

4056
01:55:00.050 --> 01:55:00.310
you know,

4057
01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:01.640
things that we've done on this show.

4058
01:55:01.641 --> 01:55:02.031
Yeah,

4059
01:55:02.031 --> 01:55:02.570
I could look,

4060
01:55:02.570 --> 01:55:03.740
I could look a little sketch.

4061
01:55:03.860 --> 01:55:04.340
Yeah.

4062
01:55:04.340 --> 01:55:05.170
Yeah.

4063
01:55:05.170 --> 01:55:07.570
<v 3>Well I mean that's true if you cherry pick,</v>

4064
01:55:07.571 --> 01:55:09.520
but people like to compare you to Howard Stern.

4065
01:55:09.550 --> 01:55:12.400
I actually don't think you're like Howard stern at all.

4066
01:55:12.820 --> 01:55:16.390
I think that you're a little more intelligent.

4067
01:55:17.050 --> 01:55:18.220
Howard Stern's a brilliant man.

4068
01:55:18.250 --> 01:55:19.240
He is a brilliant man.

4069
01:55:19.241 --> 01:55:19.690
Wrong.

4070
01:55:19.690 --> 01:55:19.931
Yeah,

4071
01:55:19.931 --> 01:55:20.320
he is.

4072
01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:23.980
I think that the topics you choose to talk about our little more intelligent,

4073
01:55:24.190 --> 01:55:24.821
well you know,

4074
01:55:24.821 --> 01:55:25.710
he does a lot of pop.

4075
01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:26.761
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

4076
01:55:26.761 --> 01:55:27.040
You know,

4077
01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:27.541
interviews,

4078
01:55:27.541 --> 01:55:29.200
a lot of artists and he,

4079
01:55:29.210 --> 01:55:32.310
he's really good at getting them to talk and say things.

4080
01:55:32.311 --> 01:55:33.600
Maybe they ordinarily that they went.

4081
01:55:33.610 --> 01:55:35.010
But you know,

4082
01:55:35.011 --> 01:55:39.210
I mean I think he's also got a much larger audience and there's also a bunch of

4083
01:55:39.211 --> 01:55:44.211
people behind him that probably would kinda like want him to talk about certain

4084
01:55:45.001 --> 01:55:45.780
subjects.

4085
01:55:45.780 --> 01:55:46.260
But I have,

4086
01:55:46.260 --> 01:55:46.531
you know,

4087
01:55:46.531 --> 01:55:51.150
we started this out just on the laptop and I don't really give a fuck what other

4088
01:55:51.151 --> 01:55:52.080
people are interested in.

4089
01:55:52.110 --> 01:55:55.680
I give a fuck when I'm interested in and this whole thing started out just for

4090
01:55:55.681 --> 01:55:55.981
fun.

4091
01:55:55.981 --> 01:55:56.760
So if I,

4092
01:55:56.760 --> 01:55:58.440
like yesterday I had a,

4093
01:55:58.450 --> 01:55:59.850
a real astronaut on,

4094
01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:02.550
I mean I had that dude who was on the,

4095
01:56:02.551 --> 01:56:03.150
uh,

4096
01:56:03.150 --> 01:56:03.961
did he leave a book now?

4097
01:56:03.961 --> 01:56:04.251
He didn't,

4098
01:56:04.251 --> 01:56:05.370
he sold send it to us.

4099
01:56:05.580 --> 01:56:10.110
He was on the space station for 166 days and it was really fucking interesting

4100
01:56:10.111 --> 01:56:10.620
stuff.

4101
01:56:10.620 --> 01:56:10.880
Yeah,

4102
01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:11.880
it was fascinating.

4103
01:56:12.330 --> 01:56:12.630
Uh,

4104
01:56:12.630 --> 01:56:13.500
Chris Hadfield,

4105
01:56:13.740 --> 01:56:14.490
he's uh,

4106
01:56:14.490 --> 01:56:15.323
he's awesome.

4107
01:56:15.420 --> 01:56:15.810
He was a,

4108
01:56:15.810 --> 01:56:17.040
that was like a real honor.

4109
01:56:17.070 --> 01:56:18.390
Like that to me is like,

4110
01:56:18.780 --> 01:56:20.300
that's the kind of people that I want to talk to.

4111
01:56:20.310 --> 01:56:22.120
I just want to talk to fascinating people.

4112
01:56:22.121 --> 01:56:22.620
Yeah.

4113
01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:23.311
Chris Ryan,

4114
01:56:23.311 --> 01:56:23.820
the guy who were,

4115
01:56:23.820 --> 01:56:24.391
we were looking at,

4116
01:56:24.391 --> 01:56:25.460
this is a photo

4117
01:56:25.490 --> 01:56:25.970
<v 3>before.</v>

4118
01:56:25.970 --> 01:56:26.211
Yeah,

4119
01:56:26.211 --> 01:56:27.260
I love Chris Ryan.

4120
01:56:27.261 --> 01:56:27.741
He's great.

4121
01:56:27.741 --> 01:56:31.340
He's been on our show several times and he's just really interesting.

4122
01:56:31.550 --> 01:56:34.790
I love his openness about sexuality and you know,

4123
01:56:34.791 --> 01:56:36.410
what humans are actually,

4124
01:56:36.860 --> 01:56:37.670
you know,

4125
01:56:37.670 --> 01:56:39.470
physically driven to do,

4126
01:56:39.530 --> 01:56:41.270
biologically driven to do.

4127
01:56:41.630 --> 01:56:44.720
And it's very different from societal norms and expectations.

4128
01:56:44.721 --> 01:56:46.430
So there's always that conflict there.

4129
01:56:46.780 --> 01:56:50.290
<v 0>Or just a standup comedian or just a an MMA fighter or just a friend.</v>

4130
01:56:50.291 --> 01:56:50.471
I mean,

4131
01:56:50.471 --> 01:56:51.690
I've had just friends on it.

4132
01:56:51.691 --> 01:56:52.121
It's just I,

4133
01:56:52.121 --> 01:56:57.121
I th I think too many people are out there trying to get the attention of,

4134
01:57:00.970 --> 01:57:01.221
of,

4135
01:57:01.221 --> 01:57:06.221
of people by like having people on that are famous or having people on there,

4136
01:57:06.610 --> 01:57:07.070
you know,

4137
01:57:07.070 --> 01:57:08.340
pop culture in that.

4138
01:57:08.350 --> 01:57:08.801
Interesting.

4139
01:57:08.801 --> 01:57:11.080
To tap into sometimes and find out what makes them tick.

4140
01:57:11.081 --> 01:57:11.890
But yeah,

4141
01:57:11.890 --> 01:57:12.371
for me,

4142
01:57:12.371 --> 01:57:14.440
I want to talk to like Neil degrasse Tyson.

4143
01:57:14.470 --> 01:57:14.741
I want to,

4144
01:57:14.741 --> 01:57:16.060
I want to talk to Sam Harris.

4145
01:57:16.061 --> 01:57:17.440
I want to talk to brilliant people.

4146
01:57:17.710 --> 01:57:19.370
I want to talk to people and pick their brain.

4147
01:57:19.371 --> 01:57:22.240
And people that don't normally hear on the radio or don't normally hear

4148
01:57:22.241 --> 01:57:23.590
interviewed on television shows.

4149
01:57:23.810 --> 01:57:24.081
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

4150
01:57:24.081 --> 01:57:24.410
I mean,

4151
01:57:24.410 --> 01:57:27.110
and going back to the discussion we had on new media,

4152
01:57:27.410 --> 01:57:31.160
that's what millennials respond to better.

4153
01:57:31.550 --> 01:57:31.880
Um,

4154
01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:36.590
they like the interviews with real people or are brilliant people who are trying

4155
01:57:36.591 --> 01:57:37.580
to make a difference in the world.

4156
01:57:37.581 --> 01:57:39.680
They liked that way more than,

4157
01:57:39.710 --> 01:57:40.011
you know,

4158
01:57:40.011 --> 01:57:43.340
the celebrity bullshit because of celebrity stuff's fun to,

4159
01:57:43.430 --> 01:57:44.030
it's fun.

4160
01:57:44.030 --> 01:57:44.570
It's fun,

4161
01:57:44.570 --> 01:57:45.740
but it's snacks.

4162
01:57:46.130 --> 01:57:46.640
Yeah.

4163
01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:50.000
I mean I think millennials will take that for what it's worth,

4164
01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:53.420
but they're more interested in change.

4165
01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:54.001
I and I,

4166
01:57:54.001 --> 01:57:57.470
and that's the reason why most of them voted for Obama because he kept preaching

4167
01:57:57.471 --> 01:57:59.240
change even though we didn't really get any of it.

4168
01:57:59.820 --> 01:58:00.200
Um,

4169
01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:01.580
so the leg of a good,

4170
01:58:01.610 --> 01:58:03.950
like we've stern interviews like Corey Feldman,

4171
01:58:04.580 --> 01:58:05.450
I'm going to listen to that.

4172
01:58:05.630 --> 01:58:06.231
You know what I mean?

4173
01:58:06.231 --> 01:58:06.900
Like I'm going to hear it.

4174
01:58:06.900 --> 01:58:07.910
I'm there for the train wreck.

4175
01:58:07.940 --> 01:58:08.181
Oh,

4176
01:58:08.181 --> 01:58:10.070
I remember very recently,

4177
01:58:10.130 --> 01:58:10.580
um,

4178
01:58:10.580 --> 01:58:12.890
Howard stern interviewed Sharon Osborne,

4179
01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:17.270
one person that I couldn't possibly care less about and it was such a

4180
01:58:17.271 --> 01:58:19.610
fascinating interview and I was like,

4181
01:58:19.611 --> 01:58:21.170
that's the magic of Howard Stern.

4182
01:58:21.171 --> 01:58:21.800
He can,

4183
01:58:21.800 --> 01:58:25.190
he can make any interview interesting because he will ask inappropriate

4184
01:58:25.191 --> 01:58:25.790
questions.

4185
01:58:25.790 --> 01:58:29.150
Digs into your psyche with someone like Sharon Osborne,

4186
01:58:29.620 --> 01:58:30.453
you know,

4187
01:58:31.070 --> 01:58:31.851
Ozzy Osborne.

4188
01:58:31.851 --> 01:58:33.230
What the fuck is going on there?

4189
01:58:33.260 --> 01:58:34.000
I don't know.

4190
01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:34.180
Uh,

4191
01:58:34.180 --> 01:58:34.550
yeah.

4192
01:58:34.550 --> 01:58:35.090
Madness,

4193
01:58:35.090 --> 01:58:35.870
craziness.

4194
01:58:35.870 --> 01:58:37.280
That is madness and craziness.

4195
01:58:37.650 --> 01:58:38.130
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

4196
01:58:38.130 --> 01:58:38.671
The uh,

4197
01:58:38.671 --> 01:58:40.620
the idea of having a podcast is,

4198
01:58:41.230 --> 01:58:41.980
I mean I never

4199
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:45.420
<v 4>really thought that I would ever have a radio show cause I always kind of</v>

4200
01:58:45.430 --> 01:58:46.263
figured like,

4201
01:58:46.460 --> 01:58:47.293
no,

4202
01:58:47.410 --> 01:58:50.860
I always enjoyed going on morning radio and I always enjoyed it when I would go

4203
01:58:50.861 --> 01:58:51.610
and do standup,

4204
01:58:51.610 --> 01:58:54.160
I would come in early to promote and you do radio,

4205
01:58:54.161 --> 01:58:55.690
like back in the days before the Internet,

4206
01:58:55.691 --> 01:58:56.650
that's how you sold tickets.

4207
01:58:57.160 --> 01:58:59.110
And I always had a good time on the air and said,

4208
01:58:59.140 --> 01:58:59.321
wow,

4209
01:58:59.321 --> 01:59:00.640
that'd be cool to have a radio show.

4210
01:59:00.940 --> 01:59:01.530
But then I was like,

4211
01:59:01.530 --> 01:59:01.641
Yo,

4212
01:59:01.641 --> 01:59:03.580
who the fuck is going to give me a radio job?

4213
01:59:03.620 --> 01:59:05.080
And that's not going to happen.

4214
01:59:05.081 --> 01:59:05.861
And on top of that,

4215
01:59:05.861 --> 01:59:06.311
they're going to tell me,

4216
01:59:06.311 --> 01:59:09.130
I can't swear and that shit's going to get tired.

4217
01:59:09.430 --> 01:59:13.000
And then satellite radio came along and I started doing the opiate Anthony show

4218
01:59:13.001 --> 01:59:13.810
a lot.

4219
01:59:13.810 --> 01:59:14.470
And uh,

4220
01:59:14.470 --> 01:59:16.510
those guys are great and they're,

4221
01:59:16.511 --> 01:59:19.570
the way they have it set up is a lot like this show where it's just a

4222
01:59:19.571 --> 01:59:20.380
conversation.

4223
01:59:20.380 --> 01:59:20.710
Yeah.

4224
01:59:20.710 --> 01:59:22.810
They don't have like a specific agenda.

4225
01:59:22.811 --> 01:59:24.100
They don't have games they want to play.

4226
01:59:24.280 --> 01:59:25.070
All Right Anna,

4227
01:59:25.070 --> 01:59:26.170
it's time to play.

4228
01:59:26.171 --> 01:59:27.880
What would you rather do?

4229
01:59:28.170 --> 01:59:28.330
You know,

4230
01:59:28.330 --> 01:59:29.820
they don't have that kind of stupid shit.

4231
01:59:29.850 --> 01:59:30.541
<v 3>It's just nice.</v>

4232
01:59:30.541 --> 01:59:32.700
It's just a conversation it just to hang.

4233
01:59:32.940 --> 01:59:34.500
And so that's really what sort of,

4234
01:59:34.501 --> 01:59:34.920
uh,

4235
01:59:34.920 --> 01:59:36.570
fueled getting this thing started.

4236
01:59:36.571 --> 01:59:37.320
But that was,

4237
01:59:37.320 --> 01:59:38.880
so you have a three hour long show.

4238
01:59:38.881 --> 01:59:41.550
Do you ever have a difficult time weighing my bladder?

4239
01:59:42.050 --> 01:59:42.510
Well,

4240
01:59:42.510 --> 01:59:42.871
yes,

4241
01:59:42.871 --> 01:59:43.381
that's a,

4242
01:59:43.381 --> 01:59:44.250
that's a good question.

4243
01:59:44.251 --> 01:59:45.210
But on top of that,

4244
01:59:45.570 --> 01:59:46.260
um,

4245
01:59:46.260 --> 01:59:50.340
it's really difficult to find guests that are willing to have a three hour long

4246
01:59:50.341 --> 01:59:51.210
conversation.

4247
01:59:51.630 --> 01:59:52.463
Yeah.

4248
01:59:52.500 --> 01:59:53.333
Well,

4249
01:59:53.590 --> 01:59:54.460
<v 4>yes and no.</v>

4250
01:59:54.640 --> 01:59:54.911
You know,

4251
01:59:54.911 --> 01:59:56.560
we don't have a hard time finding guests,

4252
01:59:56.950 --> 01:59:57.820
but um,

4253
01:59:57.880 --> 01:59:58.241
yeah,

4254
01:59:58.241 --> 01:59:59.470
some people are just not,

4255
01:59:59.530 --> 02:00:00.430
it's not right for them.

4256
02:00:00.640 --> 02:00:04.510
Some people don't want to talk for three hours because if you talk for three

4257
02:00:04.511 --> 02:00:05.201
hours long enough,

4258
02:00:05.201 --> 02:00:06.880
people are going to find out who the fuck you really are.

4259
02:00:06.881 --> 02:00:07.090
Yeah,

4260
02:00:07.090 --> 02:00:07.923
that's true.

4261
02:00:07.960 --> 02:00:08.980
It just takes time.

4262
02:00:09.070 --> 02:00:09.460
Yeah.

4263
02:00:09.460 --> 02:00:09.881
You know,

4264
02:00:09.881 --> 02:00:11.980
and they're going to find out what tweaks you or what,

4265
02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:12.370
you know,

4266
02:00:12.370 --> 02:00:12.971
what you like,

4267
02:00:12.971 --> 02:00:13.691
what you don't like,

4268
02:00:13.691 --> 02:00:14.560
what's weird about you.

4269
02:00:14.561 --> 02:00:16.300
They get to know you like very,

4270
02:00:16.301 --> 02:00:17.070
very deeply.

4271
02:00:17.070 --> 02:00:18.750
<v 3>Do you think your audience has a good sense of my,</v>

4272
02:00:18.780 --> 02:00:19.530
my weird,

4273
02:00:19.530 --> 02:00:19.831
yeah,

4274
02:00:19.831 --> 02:00:20.660
you're worse.

4275
02:00:20.660 --> 02:00:21.180
Yeah.

4276
02:00:21.180 --> 02:00:22.110
It's super weird,

4277
02:00:22.111 --> 02:00:22.944
right?

4278
02:00:23.600 --> 02:00:24.001
It's good.

4279
02:00:24.001 --> 02:00:24.810
You're a nice person.

4280
02:00:24.810 --> 02:00:25.643
That's all that matters.

4281
02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:26.970
Being a nice person.

4282
02:00:27.150 --> 02:00:28.110
The weird thing is like,

4283
02:00:28.111 --> 02:00:29.310
who the fuck's not weird?

4284
02:00:29.340 --> 02:00:29.880
You know what I mean?

4285
02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:30.571
Everyone's weird.

4286
02:00:30.571 --> 02:00:32.670
Everyone's got their little habits and stuff.

4287
02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:36.810
I was talking to my friend about how important it is to be open minded,

4288
02:00:36.811 --> 02:00:38.280
especially at this point in our lives.

4289
02:00:38.281 --> 02:00:39.114
Like when we're,

4290
02:00:39.420 --> 02:00:39.751
you know,

4291
02:00:39.751 --> 02:00:43.230
willing to meet new people and make new friends and all that other stuff and

4292
02:00:43.231 --> 02:00:47.100
like you come across people that have certain habits that are just strange.

4293
02:00:47.340 --> 02:00:48.990
And when I was younger I'd be like,

4294
02:00:49.050 --> 02:00:49.740
Ugh,

4295
02:00:49.740 --> 02:00:50.221
I just want,

4296
02:00:50.221 --> 02:00:51.600
I don't want anything to do with this person.

4297
02:00:51.601 --> 02:00:53.070
And now I love this.

4298
02:00:53.071 --> 02:00:55.830
I love that I've grown into this person where,

4299
02:00:55.920 --> 02:00:56.730
where,

4300
02:00:56.730 --> 02:00:58.170
where I will step back,

4301
02:00:58.620 --> 02:01:01.440
I'll realize that something's weird and it'll make me uncomfortable.

4302
02:01:01.441 --> 02:01:04.710
I'll ask why it makes me uncomfortable and I'll be like,

4303
02:01:05.010 --> 02:01:05.460
all right,

4304
02:01:05.460 --> 02:01:06.120
that's fine.

4305
02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:08.490
It's not something that's going to hurt me or damage me,

4306
02:01:08.491 --> 02:01:10.110
so live with it.

4307
02:01:10.290 --> 02:01:11.123
It doesn't bother me.

4308
02:01:11.170 --> 02:01:13.570
<v 4>Like if you're out with people and they're holding hands and you're like,</v>

4309
02:01:13.571 --> 02:01:14.440
so what's your deal?

4310
02:01:14.441 --> 02:01:14.711
And like,

4311
02:01:14.711 --> 02:01:14.831
oh,

4312
02:01:14.831 --> 02:01:15.670
we're swingers,

4313
02:01:16.050 --> 02:01:16.500
where to go

4314
02:01:16.500 --> 02:01:16.890
<v 3>swim call.</v>

4315
02:01:16.890 --> 02:01:17.370
I get,

4316
02:01:17.370 --> 02:01:17.761
I mean,

4317
02:01:17.761 --> 02:01:18.720
if you're swingers,

4318
02:01:18.750 --> 02:01:19.231
like I'm,

4319
02:01:19.231 --> 02:01:20.580
I don't want to join you guys,

4320
02:01:20.590 --> 02:01:21.900
but no one does,

4321
02:01:21.901 --> 02:01:22.830
but do you?

4322
02:01:22.900 --> 02:01:23.580
Yeah.

4323
02:01:23.580 --> 02:01:23.860
Yeah.

4324
02:01:23.860 --> 02:01:25.440
And you're always disgusting humans.

4325
02:01:26.220 --> 02:01:26.611
I don't know.

4326
02:01:26.611 --> 02:01:27.930
I've actually never met swingers.

4327
02:01:28.410 --> 02:01:29.400
Swingers in my whole life.

4328
02:01:29.510 --> 02:01:29.570
Like,

4329
02:01:29.570 --> 02:01:29.820
yeah,

4330
02:01:29.820 --> 02:01:30.251
<v 4>out now.</v>

4331
02:01:30.251 --> 02:01:31.210
Tell me they were swingers,

4332
02:01:31.220 --> 02:01:32.110
like introduce themselves.

4333
02:01:32.140 --> 02:01:32.770
Swingers.

4334
02:01:32.770 --> 02:01:33.221
One of them,

4335
02:01:33.221 --> 02:01:34.510
Ari and I were in Nashville.

4336
02:01:34.511 --> 02:01:39.511
We were doing stand up and this guy was driving us around for two days and uh,

4337
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:41.000
he was a limo driver.

4338
02:01:41.001 --> 02:01:42.170
And did was like,

4339
02:01:42.230 --> 02:01:42.861
yes sir.

4340
02:01:42.861 --> 02:01:43.281
No Sir.

4341
02:01:43.281 --> 02:01:46.760
And then finally he's dropping us off at the airport and the dude just opens up

4342
02:01:46.761 --> 02:01:50.180
the flood gates and just starts talking about swing in and what he,

4343
02:01:50.181 --> 02:01:51.860
what he does and what he likes to do.

4344
02:01:51.861 --> 02:01:52.694
And you know,

4345
02:01:52.890 --> 02:01:54.740
I don't really like to watch my wife get fucked,

4346
02:01:54.741 --> 02:01:55.130
but uh,

4347
02:01:55.130 --> 02:01:57.770
sometimes she likes watching me have sex and you know,

4348
02:01:57.771 --> 02:01:58.550
I don't,

4349
02:01:58.550 --> 02:02:00.020
if I don't feel comfortable about a guy,

4350
02:02:00.021 --> 02:02:00.940
I can tell her no.

4351
02:02:00.990 --> 02:02:01.521
We were like,

4352
02:02:01.521 --> 02:02:02.354
what?

4353
02:02:02.450 --> 02:02:03.650
Like how do what?

4354
02:02:03.740 --> 02:02:05.660
I wonder what kind of guys he's uncomfortable with.

4355
02:02:05.720 --> 02:02:07.070
Big Ones probably.

4356
02:02:07.071 --> 02:02:07.480
Yeah.

4357
02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:07.781
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

4358
02:02:07.781 --> 02:02:08.021
He's,

4359
02:02:08.021 --> 02:02:10.450
he's probably a fan of the mediocre guy theory.

4360
02:02:10.550 --> 02:02:11.383
<v 4>Absolutely.</v>

4361
02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:12.021
Yeah.

4362
02:02:12.021 --> 02:02:15.770
You don't want to let your girlfriend get gorilla fuck by some giant linemen in

4363
02:02:15.771 --> 02:02:16.604
front of you.

4364
02:02:16.640 --> 02:02:16.851
You know?

4365
02:02:16.851 --> 02:02:18.170
That would be horrendous.

4366
02:02:18.620 --> 02:02:18.951
That was,

4367
02:02:18.951 --> 02:02:20.420
that's the last thing you want.

4368
02:02:20.540 --> 02:02:22.190
So he can like give the red light.

4369
02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:22.790
He's,

4370
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:23.330
he won't,

4371
02:02:23.330 --> 02:02:25.310
he was saving himself for a guy who was coughing.

4372
02:02:25.620 --> 02:02:25.820
Oh.

4373
02:02:25.820 --> 02:02:26.181
Someone,

4374
02:02:26.181 --> 02:02:27.350
a man with a limp,

4375
02:02:27.620 --> 02:02:28.453
you know,

4376
02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:29.383
take him hunting.

4377
02:02:31.020 --> 02:02:32.720
He'll show you a good looking guy.

4378
02:02:32.721 --> 02:02:33.410
Yeah.

4379
02:02:33.410 --> 02:02:33.651
Yeah.

4380
02:02:33.651 --> 02:02:38.600
Just try to find some guy who's like less endowed than you fear older than you.

4381
02:02:38.630 --> 02:02:39.110
Yeah.

4382
02:02:39.110 --> 02:02:40.220
That's understandable though.

4383
02:02:40.221 --> 02:02:43.490
You don't want to deal with that competition I guess.

4384
02:02:43.700 --> 02:02:44.930
Just sad.

4385
02:02:45.290 --> 02:02:45.651
<v 3>Um,</v>

4386
02:02:45.651 --> 02:02:48.610
we had a conversation about like furries on the show before.

4387
02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:49.570
Oh yeah.

4388
02:02:49.970 --> 02:02:51.840
And so I don't see anything wrong.

4389
02:02:51.890 --> 02:02:52.191
I mean,

4390
02:02:52.191 --> 02:02:53.890
I don't prefer furries,

4391
02:02:53.900 --> 02:02:54.621
don't get me wrong,

4392
02:02:54.621 --> 02:02:57.650
but like whatever they like to dress up as animals when they're having sex.

4393
02:02:57.651 --> 02:02:58.670
Like I don't care.

4394
02:02:58.760 --> 02:02:59.411
That doesn't bother me.

4395
02:02:59.411 --> 02:03:02.240
Like if I found out someone I'm hanging out with his into that,

4396
02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:03.920
then I would just be like,

4397
02:03:03.921 --> 02:03:04.251
all right,

4398
02:03:04.251 --> 02:03:04.850
you're into that.

4399
02:03:04.850 --> 02:03:05.710
It's totally fine.

4400
02:03:05.790 --> 02:03:06.330
<v 4>Really.</v>

4401
02:03:06.330 --> 02:03:09.030
So if you're dating a guy and you found out that he was into being a furry and

4402
02:03:09.031 --> 02:03:10.170
he would go to furry conventions,

4403
02:03:10.171 --> 02:03:11.560
they'd sniff each other's fake butts,

4404
02:03:12.210 --> 02:03:13.770
bounce around like squirrels.

4405
02:03:14.100 --> 02:03:14.611
You'd be like,

4406
02:03:14.611 --> 02:03:15.444
that's fine.

4407
02:03:15.570 --> 02:03:16.590
I don't have a problem with that.

4408
02:03:16.620 --> 02:03:17.453
Come on.

4409
02:03:17.790 --> 02:03:18.623
You would judge him.

4410
02:03:18.730 --> 02:03:19.121
<v 3>I don't,</v>

4411
02:03:19.121 --> 02:03:19.870
I'm not in that.

4412
02:03:19.870 --> 02:03:20.260
Okay.

4413
02:03:20.260 --> 02:03:22.780
I would like to say that I would not judge him.

4414
02:03:22.890 --> 02:03:26.400
<v 4>I would judge the shit out of a girl if I was dating and I was a,</v>

4415
02:03:26.420 --> 02:03:29.100
and I met a girl and we're hanging out and she's pretty cool.

4416
02:03:29.101 --> 02:03:29.821
And then she's like,

4417
02:03:29.821 --> 02:03:31.770
well this is one thing that I really liked to do.

4418
02:03:31.950 --> 02:03:35.040
I like to pretend to be a chipmunk mascot and uh,

4419
02:03:35.041 --> 02:03:38.910
I put on my chip Monck mascot outfit on and I go to these conventions in

4420
02:03:38.911 --> 02:03:39.511
Pittsburgh.

4421
02:03:39.511 --> 02:03:43.260
We all fly in with our furry outfits on and we danced around together and we

4422
02:03:43.261 --> 02:03:44.370
planned that pretend to have sex,

4423
02:03:44.371 --> 02:03:45.900
but no one really penetrates anybody.

4424
02:03:46.980 --> 02:03:47.580
<v 3>Um,</v>

4425
02:03:47.580 --> 02:03:48.020
yeah,

4426
02:03:48.020 --> 02:03:48.853
I look,

4427
02:03:49.470 --> 02:03:50.340
it is what it is.

4428
02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:51.930
I feel like there definitely,

4429
02:03:52.050 --> 02:03:56.880
there are worse fetishes out there like guys who like to wear diapers and they

4430
02:03:56.881 --> 02:03:57.900
like to get changed.

4431
02:03:57.901 --> 02:04:00.300
Like that kind of stuff scares the hell out of me.

4432
02:04:00.830 --> 02:04:02.520
How do you even preach that conversation?

4433
02:04:02.550 --> 02:04:03.300
I don't even know.

4434
02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:04.051
I don't even know.

4435
02:04:04.051 --> 02:04:04.440
I,

4436
02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:08.280
I don't know how I give them like furries for instance.

4437
02:04:08.281 --> 02:04:12.270
I give them props because how do you find someone who's willing to deal with

4438
02:04:12.271 --> 02:04:12.930
your fetish?

4439
02:04:12.930 --> 02:04:13.231
<v 4>Well,</v>

4440
02:04:13.231 --> 02:04:18.231
I think there's something in being willing to deal with almost anything that's

4441
02:04:18.421 --> 02:04:19.254
like,

4442
02:04:19.340 --> 02:04:20.880
it's extra attractive.

4443
02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:22.350
You have to be open minded.

4444
02:04:22.380 --> 02:04:22.651
Yeah.

4445
02:04:22.651 --> 02:04:24.270
Well when people start dating each other,

4446
02:04:24.271 --> 02:04:25.104
this is my thing,

4447
02:04:25.270 --> 02:04:25.580
my,

4448
02:04:25.580 --> 02:04:26.010
my,

4449
02:04:26.010 --> 02:04:27.570
my thinking on it is that when,

4450
02:04:27.571 --> 02:04:28.890
when people start dating each other,

4451
02:04:28.891 --> 02:04:32.070
if someone really wants someone to be a part of their life,

4452
02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:36.780
they might like want to do something like really weird with them to show them

4453
02:04:36.781 --> 02:04:38.070
that do not care.

4454
02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:38.791
<v 0>I'll do anything.</v>

4455
02:04:38.791 --> 02:04:39.810
I'll change your diaper.

4456
02:04:39.811 --> 02:04:40.644
I'll wipe your butt.

4457
02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:41.311
Oh my God.

4458
02:04:41.311 --> 02:04:43.890
Like I remember a dude that I know he would take,

4459
02:04:43.950 --> 02:04:44.521
we were at a,

4460
02:04:44.521 --> 02:04:44.810
um,

4461
02:04:44.810 --> 02:04:45.361
a fight.

4462
02:04:45.361 --> 02:04:46.200
It was backstage.

4463
02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:46.500
Uh,

4464
02:04:46.500 --> 02:04:46.770
my,

4465
02:04:46.770 --> 02:04:51.060
my friend was warming up in the green room and this dude went into the bathroom

4466
02:04:51.180 --> 02:04:54.750
with his girlfriend and took a shit like in front of her.

4467
02:04:54.900 --> 02:04:57.360
It's like little bathroom together and I go,

4468
02:04:57.361 --> 02:04:59.430
did you just take a shit in front of a really?

4469
02:04:59.550 --> 02:05:00.630
Cause I went in there afterwards.

4470
02:05:00.631 --> 02:05:01.500
It was horrible.

4471
02:05:01.560 --> 02:05:02.850
He wrecked the bathroom.

4472
02:05:02.940 --> 02:05:03.100
Oh,

4473
02:05:03.100 --> 02:05:03.621
why,

4474
02:05:03.621 --> 02:05:03.991
why?

4475
02:05:03.991 --> 02:05:04.920
But I asked him,

4476
02:05:04.921 --> 02:05:05.340
I go,

4477
02:05:05.340 --> 02:05:05.581
I go,

4478
02:05:05.581 --> 02:05:06.211
what's that about?

4479
02:05:06.211 --> 02:05:06.421
He goes,

4480
02:05:06.421 --> 02:05:07.260
we do everything together,

4481
02:05:07.261 --> 02:05:07.441
man.

4482
02:05:07.441 --> 02:05:08.274
We do everything together.

4483
02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:08.490
<v 3>No,</v>

4484
02:05:08.490 --> 02:05:09.450
that's not healthy.

4485
02:05:09.480 --> 02:05:10.440
That's not healthy though.

4486
02:05:11.680 --> 02:05:12.480
But that's,

4487
02:05:12.480 --> 02:05:14.100
that's how can you say it's not,

4488
02:05:14.101 --> 02:05:16.100
and you can say where the fucking furry outfit is,

4489
02:05:16.590 --> 02:05:20.910
but that there's like a codependency issue there that's not healthy.

4490
02:05:20.911 --> 02:05:22.440
If you have to do everything together,

4491
02:05:22.441 --> 02:05:23.760
that would be my nightmare.

4492
02:05:23.940 --> 02:05:28.940
My goal in life is to find a guy that is comfortable with me living my life and

4493
02:05:30.061 --> 02:05:32.250
not just Jews right now writing on Twitter.

4494
02:05:32.251 --> 02:05:33.084
I

4495
02:05:34.050 --> 02:05:39.050
know your life and I feel like sometimes like my issue is I'm too like wrapped

4496
02:05:42.301 --> 02:05:47.280
up in my career bubble and I'm really attracted to like independent guys that

4497
02:05:47.281 --> 02:05:49.500
don't want a girl who's like always on him.

4498
02:05:49.830 --> 02:05:50.400
Like guys,

4499
02:05:50.400 --> 02:05:51.930
guys pretend like they don't like that,

4500
02:05:51.931 --> 02:05:52.561
but they do.

4501
02:05:52.561 --> 02:05:56.340
They want a girl who's all about him all the time and I'm just not that kind of

4502
02:05:56.341 --> 02:05:57.060
person.

4503
02:05:57.060 --> 02:05:58.860
Especially if you have your own career.

4504
02:05:58.960 --> 02:05:59.420
Yeah,

4505
02:05:59.420 --> 02:05:59.830
I assume.

4506
02:05:59.830 --> 02:06:00.630
And convenient.

4507
02:06:00.630 --> 02:06:01.800
I love it.

4508
02:06:01.801 --> 02:06:02.101
Is it,

4509
02:06:02.101 --> 02:06:03.060
is it inconvenient?

4510
02:06:03.420 --> 02:06:04.253
Some people,

4511
02:06:04.590 --> 02:06:05.160
um,

4512
02:06:05.160 --> 02:06:07.860
I love like independent,

4513
02:06:07.861 --> 02:06:09.360
strong people.

4514
02:06:09.420 --> 02:06:11.100
Like that's the biggest turn onto me,

4515
02:06:11.101 --> 02:06:11.490
mommy.

4516
02:06:11.490 --> 02:06:11.761
I like,

4517
02:06:11.761 --> 02:06:12.360
I'm weak.

4518
02:06:12.360 --> 02:06:13.170
Dependent,

4519
02:06:13.170 --> 02:06:13.740
a lot of,

4520
02:06:13.740 --> 02:06:14.573
a lot of people do.

4521
02:06:14.790 --> 02:06:15.391
I like that.

4522
02:06:15.391 --> 02:06:16.620
I like when people get sick a lot.

4523
02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:18.390
People need you to give them soup.

4524
02:06:18.391 --> 02:06:20.320
And a lot of people do like that.

4525
02:06:20.710 --> 02:06:22.620
Co dependency is a real issue.

4526
02:06:22.740 --> 02:06:23.430
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

4527
02:06:23.430 --> 02:06:24.190
well people want,

4528
02:06:24.190 --> 02:06:24.690
I mean,

4529
02:06:24.690 --> 02:06:27.570
isn't that really the mediocre guy theory that you want to make sure it doesn't

4530
02:06:27.571 --> 02:06:28.190
go anywhere?

4531
02:06:28.190 --> 02:06:29.023
<v 3>No.</v>

4532
02:06:29.060 --> 02:06:29.900
Sort of similar.

4533
02:06:30.080 --> 02:06:30.913
And by the way,

4534
02:06:31.550 --> 02:06:33.350
just to be completely crystal clear,

4535
02:06:33.380 --> 02:06:36.680
my mediocre guy theory is a little bit of a joke like Austin,

4536
02:06:36.740 --> 02:06:40.490
like obviously I don't want a mediocre guy and obviously I want a guy that I'm

4537
02:06:40.491 --> 02:06:41.570
physically attracted to.

4538
02:06:41.571 --> 02:06:45.890
But I do believe that a guy is as faithful as his opportunities.

4539
02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:46.850
Same goes for women,

4540
02:06:46.851 --> 02:06:47.301
by the way.

4541
02:06:47.301 --> 02:06:48.134
It's not just men,

4542
02:06:48.190 --> 02:06:49.350
<v 0>those dirty bitches.</v>

4543
02:06:49.490 --> 02:06:50.820
I can't believe you're saying that.

4544
02:06:52.050 --> 02:06:52.590
Yeah.

4545
02:06:52.590 --> 02:06:52.980
Well,

4546
02:06:52.980 --> 02:06:53.520
you know what?

4547
02:06:53.520 --> 02:06:56.190
It's especially human beings when they're not.

4548
02:06:56.250 --> 02:06:57.083
Like,

4549
02:06:57.810 --> 02:06:58.590
if you're not,

4550
02:06:58.590 --> 02:06:59.011
if you,

4551
02:06:59.011 --> 02:07:03.630
if you haven't found someone that enthralls you or someone that you're like

4552
02:07:03.660 --> 02:07:05.370
deeply locked in with,

4553
02:07:05.820 --> 02:07:08.010
it's real easy.

4554
02:07:08.011 --> 02:07:09.490
So like lose a relationship,

4555
02:07:09.510 --> 02:07:11.280
but you got a relationship and it's like,

4556
02:07:11.281 --> 02:07:11.701
you know,

4557
02:07:11.701 --> 02:07:12.390
uh,

4558
02:07:12.390 --> 02:07:13.950
I'm not investing any more time in this.

4559
02:07:15.090 --> 02:07:15.923
And then boom,

4560
02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:19.950
and guys are always worried about the music ending and then being left without a

4561
02:07:19.951 --> 02:07:21.060
chair and you're like,

4562
02:07:21.061 --> 02:07:21.511
hey,

4563
02:07:21.511 --> 02:07:21.691
you know,

4564
02:07:21.691 --> 02:07:22.710
you're playing musical chairs.

4565
02:07:22.711 --> 02:07:26.430
The music stops and there's nowhere to sit down and then no one wants me.

4566
02:07:26.730 --> 02:07:27.540
And that's that thing,

4567
02:07:27.540 --> 02:07:30.660
that thing that a lot of people want someone to want them.

4568
02:07:30.930 --> 02:07:32.700
And if they're dating an independent woman,

4569
02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:35.530
they realize like this check whether she enjoys your company or not.

4570
02:07:35.710 --> 02:07:36.040
She could

4571
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:36.491
<v 4>do without you,</v>

4572
02:07:36.491 --> 02:07:36.731
dude.

4573
02:07:36.731 --> 02:07:37.630
And she's fine.

4574
02:07:37.870 --> 02:07:39.610
You know that that freaks guys out.

4575
02:07:39.640 --> 02:07:40.331
A lot of guys,

4576
02:07:40.331 --> 02:07:43.780
they want some girl who's like waiting by the phone when you call her.

4577
02:07:43.781 --> 02:07:44.171
Oh my God,

4578
02:07:44.171 --> 02:07:45.190
I was so happy you called.

4579
02:07:45.310 --> 02:07:46.150
Should I say that?

4580
02:07:46.390 --> 02:07:46.601
You know,

4581
02:07:46.601 --> 02:07:46.761
they,

4582
02:07:46.761 --> 02:07:48.540
they love stoop year.

4583
02:07:49.740 --> 02:07:52.510
That's such a hard buying it for a second.

4584
02:07:52.540 --> 02:07:52.661
No,

4585
02:07:52.661 --> 02:07:53.021
it's true.

4586
02:07:53.021 --> 02:07:56.440
It's just the same reason why like people pretend they like to fight.

4587
02:07:56.710 --> 02:07:57.521
Like men,

4588
02:07:57.521 --> 02:07:58.390
like always say like,

4589
02:07:58.391 --> 02:07:58.631
Oh,

4590
02:07:58.631 --> 02:07:59.950
if I knew if I was a black belt,

4591
02:07:59.970 --> 02:08:00.731
I'd go to the UFC,

4592
02:08:00.731 --> 02:08:01.564
kick everybody's ass.

4593
02:08:02.080 --> 02:08:03.820
Now that's not what you're,

4594
02:08:03.821 --> 02:08:05.200
you don't understand what you're saying.

4595
02:08:05.470 --> 02:08:08.230
What you're saying is you would like to beat somebody up,

4596
02:08:08.260 --> 02:08:11.800
but you don't really actually want to fight because the fighting is fucking

4597
02:08:11.801 --> 02:08:13.720
brutal and somebody might beat you up.

4598
02:08:13.750 --> 02:08:14.561
You could lose.

4599
02:08:14.561 --> 02:08:15.730
It's not guaranteed.

4600
02:08:15.880 --> 02:08:17.650
It's a risky wild.

4601
02:08:17.990 --> 02:08:18.350
The,

4602
02:08:18.350 --> 02:08:18.760
the,

4603
02:08:18.760 --> 02:08:19.031
the,

4604
02:08:19.031 --> 02:08:19.181
the,

4605
02:08:19.181 --> 02:08:19.991
the whole thing.

4606
02:08:19.991 --> 02:08:20.580
The whole,

4607
02:08:20.580 --> 02:08:23.230
the whole proposition is incredibly risky.

4608
02:08:23.530 --> 02:08:24.790
So are relationships.

4609
02:08:24.970 --> 02:08:26.560
Relationships are unbelievably risky.

4610
02:08:26.561 --> 02:08:27.050
Of course.

4611
02:08:27.050 --> 02:08:29.050
A lot of people don't even want to enter in relationship.

4612
02:08:29.140 --> 02:08:30.310
They just want to smash it.

4613
02:08:30.550 --> 02:08:34.120
They just want to go in there and kick somebody's ass the same way they want to

4614
02:08:34.121 --> 02:08:37.360
go in there and kick somebody's ass in a fight and not actually be in a fight.

4615
02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:41.170
They don't want to date some girl's smart intelligence going to see through my

4616
02:08:41.171 --> 02:08:45.040
bullshit and I can't use all the stuff that I learned in my pickup artist's book

4617
02:08:45.041 --> 02:08:46.600
that I've been reading for the past six months.

4618
02:08:47.080 --> 02:08:48.420
You're gonna see right through that and that,

4619
02:08:48.421 --> 02:08:48.980
and you're going to,

4620
02:08:48.980 --> 02:08:49.390
you know,

4621
02:08:49.390 --> 02:08:51.430
pick out the flaws and all my arguments.

4622
02:08:51.431 --> 02:08:52.330
Fuck that.

4623
02:08:52.570 --> 02:08:57.570
I'm just looking for a dumb chick with a limp that I could dominate for a short

4624
02:08:57.761 --> 02:08:59.080
amount of time and then bail.

4625
02:08:59.140 --> 02:09:01.090
That is a sexy man right there.

4626
02:09:01.390 --> 02:09:02.111
It's a week dude.

4627
02:09:02.111 --> 02:09:03.010
But there's a lot of them.

4628
02:09:03.070 --> 02:09:04.780
And it's because people were scared of failure.

4629
02:09:05.260 --> 02:09:07.330
<v 2>Some really like strong,</v>

4630
02:09:07.331 --> 02:09:08.410
intelligent,

4631
02:09:09.400 --> 02:09:10.480
confident men.

4632
02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:10.990
Um,

4633
02:09:10.990 --> 02:09:13.360
and I love that they exist.

4634
02:09:13.660 --> 02:09:14.351
They exist.

4635
02:09:14.351 --> 02:09:14.801
They're like,

4636
02:09:14.801 --> 02:09:15.640
they're very,

4637
02:09:15.641 --> 02:09:16.211
very rare.

4638
02:09:16.211 --> 02:09:17.080
But they exist.

4639
02:09:17.081 --> 02:09:17.321
I know.

4640
02:09:17.321 --> 02:09:17.650
I should,

4641
02:09:17.650 --> 02:09:18.760
I shouldn't even say they're very,

4642
02:09:18.761 --> 02:09:19.121
very rare.

4643
02:09:19.121 --> 02:09:19.691
How do I know?

4644
02:09:19.691 --> 02:09:21.580
It's not like I've been dating like a billion guys.

4645
02:09:21.581 --> 02:09:22.120
Right.

4646
02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:22.990
But they exist.

4647
02:09:22.991 --> 02:09:23.191
And,

4648
02:09:23.191 --> 02:09:23.520
and,

4649
02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:25.810
and when I say that I liked the independence,

4650
02:09:25.811 --> 02:09:27.910
it doesn't mean like I don't need him.

4651
02:09:28.750 --> 02:09:32.740
It means this person makes me a better person and I want to make him a better

4652
02:09:32.741 --> 02:09:33.161
person.

4653
02:09:33.161 --> 02:09:34.600
We have this strong bond,

4654
02:09:34.601 --> 02:09:35.950
this strong partnership,

4655
02:09:36.220 --> 02:09:38.050
but we don't suffocate each other.

4656
02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:40.630
I think a lot of relationships are suffocating.

4657
02:09:40.990 --> 02:09:43.990
And I want to avoid that at all costs.

4658
02:09:44.350 --> 02:09:45.010
You know what I mean?

4659
02:09:45.010 --> 02:09:45.431
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

4660
02:09:45.431 --> 02:09:45.681
It's,

4661
02:09:45.681 --> 02:09:49.570
it's tough to not be suffocating sometimes if you're scared and you're clinging

4662
02:09:49.571 --> 02:09:52.150
onto the last piece of wood you found floating in the ocean.

4663
02:09:52.500 --> 02:09:52.900
Yeah.

4664
02:09:52.900 --> 02:09:54.370
After the horrible wreck of the rest,

4665
02:09:54.390 --> 02:09:57.100
the last x amount of years of your life,

4666
02:09:57.580 --> 02:09:58.301
that's a lot of people.

4667
02:09:58.301 --> 02:09:58.961
You run into them.

4668
02:09:58.961 --> 02:10:00.370
You're not just running into a person,

4669
02:10:00.550 --> 02:10:01.590
you're running into a person.

4670
02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:03.520
It's just getting back on their feet from some whatever,

4671
02:10:03.521 --> 02:10:04.570
fucking disaster,

4672
02:10:04.860 --> 02:10:05.591
whatever it was,

4673
02:10:05.591 --> 02:10:06.660
whatever breakup,

4674
02:10:06.890 --> 02:10:07.810
whatever you know,

4675
02:10:08.050 --> 02:10:08.381
home,

4676
02:10:08.381 --> 02:10:09.310
repossession,

4677
02:10:09.311 --> 02:10:10.100
last job.

4678
02:10:10.100 --> 02:10:10.340
What?

4679
02:10:10.340 --> 02:10:14.770
What is the crisis that you just recently survived and just washed up on shore

4680
02:10:14.950 --> 02:10:16.360
and now you're meeting that person.

4681
02:10:16.680 --> 02:10:17.330
So let me,

4682
02:10:17.330 --> 02:10:19.390
you meet someone in their thirties oh my God.

4683
02:10:19.391 --> 02:10:20.560
You're meeting a lot of shit.

4684
02:10:20.890 --> 02:10:22.500
You meeting a lot of shits,

4685
02:10:22.510 --> 02:10:23.380
a lot of years.

4686
02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:24.310
It's not a bad thing.

4687
02:10:24.580 --> 02:10:25.960
Some people are better for it though.

4688
02:10:25.970 --> 02:10:26.231
I mean,

4689
02:10:26.231 --> 02:10:27.310
there's the bright side of it.

4690
02:10:27.670 --> 02:10:28.181
Some people,

4691
02:10:28.181 --> 02:10:29.560
because of all those disasters,

4692
02:10:29.561 --> 02:10:33.260
they develop character and they understand what's good and not good,

4693
02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:33.801
what,

4694
02:10:33.801 --> 02:10:34.940
how they should behave,

4695
02:10:34.941 --> 02:10:37.610
what are the ramifications of different kinds of behaviors.

4696
02:10:37.660 --> 02:10:38.150
Yeah.

4697
02:10:38.150 --> 02:10:38.450
The,

4698
02:10:38.450 --> 02:10:38.690
yeah.

4699
02:10:38.690 --> 02:10:39.740
You find that out,

4700
02:10:39.950 --> 02:10:41.990
but you know how many of you will learn from their mistakes?

4701
02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:43.220
Half,

4702
02:10:43.220 --> 02:10:46.610
half of them to 50% of the people learn at least half.

4703
02:10:46.611 --> 02:10:47.330
I hope.

4704
02:10:47.330 --> 02:10:47.871
I would hope,

4705
02:10:47.871 --> 02:10:51.200
but I don't think it's even 40 I think it's probably like 30 the rest of the

4706
02:10:51.201 --> 02:10:53.330
people are just banging their heads on coconut trees.

4707
02:10:53.390 --> 02:10:54.230
People are crazy.

4708
02:10:54.590 --> 02:10:55.520
<v 2>They are crazy.</v>

4709
02:10:55.640 --> 02:10:56.091
I just,

4710
02:10:56.091 --> 02:11:01.091
I feel like it's better to look if you don't meet someone that makes you feel

4711
02:11:01.731 --> 02:11:03.740
good about yourself and you do the same for them.

4712
02:11:03.741 --> 02:11:07.440
I feel like it's just better to be alone and live your life and wait.

4713
02:11:07.490 --> 02:11:09.560
<v 4>If be an old lady with a lot of cats in a vibrator,</v>

4714
02:11:10.630 --> 02:11:11.000
fine.

4715
02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:12.380
Maybe not the cats vibrator.

4716
02:11:12.420 --> 02:11:12.710
Sure.

4717
02:11:12.710 --> 02:11:13.543
Why not?

4718
02:11:14.420 --> 02:11:15.350
Did you see that new,

4719
02:11:15.351 --> 02:11:17.330
a oculus rift thing that they have?

4720
02:11:17.350 --> 02:11:17.600
Oh,

4721
02:11:17.600 --> 02:11:19.280
the three d reality goggles.

4722
02:11:19.730 --> 02:11:23.150
They've come up with one now that allows you to have sex and it connects you to

4723
02:11:23.151 --> 02:11:26.780
some sort of an artificial thing that's like a fleshlight.

4724
02:11:26.810 --> 02:11:27.460
It's moving up.

4725
02:11:27.460 --> 02:11:28.180
<v 2>No,</v>

4726
02:11:28.180 --> 02:11:29.410
I know nothing about that.

4727
02:11:29.411 --> 02:11:33.430
But I have like read stories about robots that they're creating that are very

4728
02:11:33.431 --> 02:11:34.151
lifelike.

4729
02:11:34.151 --> 02:11:34.980
So,

4730
02:11:34.980 --> 02:11:35.290
you know,

4731
02:11:35.290 --> 02:11:36.960
women will be useless in and you know,

4732
02:11:36.970 --> 02:11:39.340
10 years or something when these are perfected in Japan.

4733
02:11:39.341 --> 02:11:39.731
I'm just,

4734
02:11:39.731 --> 02:11:41.530
I'm kidding about the women being useless

4735
02:11:42.140 --> 02:11:43.220
<v 4>for some men.</v>

4736
02:11:43.221 --> 02:11:46.250
There'll be something that they won't have the effort to pursue anymore.

4737
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:46.700
Right.

4738
02:11:46.700 --> 02:11:47.630
That's going to be real.

4739
02:11:47.670 --> 02:11:48.241
<v 2>I've talked,</v>

4740
02:11:48.241 --> 02:11:51.660
I've talked to a guy who cannot wait.

4741
02:11:52.210 --> 02:11:56.160
I cannot wait for these sex robots to be perfected.

4742
02:11:56.610 --> 02:11:57.443
Um,

4743
02:11:57.450 --> 02:11:58.111
so,

4744
02:11:58.111 --> 02:11:58.251
and,

4745
02:11:58.251 --> 02:11:59.610
and he's like totally honest about it.

4746
02:11:59.611 --> 02:11:59.791
He's like,

4747
02:11:59.791 --> 02:12:00.031
yeah,

4748
02:12:00.031 --> 02:12:04.050
there's so lifelike that you can like have a relationship with a sex robot.

4749
02:12:04.590 --> 02:12:05.131
And it's like,

4750
02:12:05.131 --> 02:12:05.491
I don't,

4751
02:12:05.491 --> 02:12:07.490
I don't even know what my response should be to that.

4752
02:12:07.960 --> 02:12:11.040
<v 4>That worries always be an empty hollow relationship.</v>

4753
02:12:11.041 --> 02:12:12.720
There's always going to be something missing from it.

4754
02:12:12.750 --> 02:12:15.270
You're always going to want to have sex with them maybe.

4755
02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:15.831
Yeah.

4756
02:12:15.831 --> 02:12:17.610
But if they look like super hot and they're robots,

4757
02:12:17.611 --> 02:12:18.840
but hanging out with them,

4758
02:12:19.050 --> 02:12:21.990
there's gonna come a point in time when you realize that this is just a bunch of

4759
02:12:21.991 --> 02:12:25.680
circuits and it's just a bunch of electrical impulses going through a board,

4760
02:12:25.830 --> 02:12:29.070
definitely staring at you and coming at you with some prerecorded voice.

4761
02:12:29.130 --> 02:12:29.820
Yeah.

4762
02:12:29.820 --> 02:12:30.780
It's going to be weird.

4763
02:12:31.830 --> 02:12:35.940
People are always going to the part of what people like about people is that

4764
02:12:35.941 --> 02:12:37.590
we're all in this crazy thing together.

4765
02:12:37.670 --> 02:12:37.971
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

4766
02:12:37.971 --> 02:12:38.804
that's true.

4767
02:12:38.870 --> 02:12:39.260
And,

4768
02:12:39.260 --> 02:12:39.861
and you know,

4769
02:12:39.861 --> 02:12:43.250
going back to the necessity of human interaction,

4770
02:12:43.530 --> 02:12:44.030
um,

4771
02:12:44.030 --> 02:12:45.890
in some Asian countries,

4772
02:12:45.980 --> 02:12:46.610
they,

4773
02:12:46.610 --> 02:12:50.000
prostitutes offers something called the girlfriend experience and they probably

4774
02:12:50.001 --> 02:12:51.410
do that here in the United States too.

4775
02:12:51.411 --> 02:12:53.930
But I distinctly remember talking about it in Korea,

4776
02:12:53.931 --> 02:12:54.764
I believe.

4777
02:12:54.980 --> 02:12:55.480
And,

4778
02:12:55.480 --> 02:12:56.313
um,

4779
02:12:56.330 --> 02:12:58.310
they don't just have sex with the guys.

4780
02:12:58.311 --> 02:12:58.881
Like they,

4781
02:12:58.881 --> 02:12:59.601
in some cases,

4782
02:12:59.601 --> 02:13:00.920
they never have sex with the guys.

4783
02:13:00.921 --> 02:13:05.270
The guys will pay for the girl to be like a girlfriend where she's like

4784
02:13:05.271 --> 02:13:09.170
nurturing and caring and cuddles with him and watches movies with him and stuff

4785
02:13:09.171 --> 02:13:09.890
like that.

4786
02:13:09.890 --> 02:13:13.400
And that actually gave me a little bit of faith in humanity because that showed

4787
02:13:13.401 --> 02:13:15.920
me that there are people out there that just want that.

4788
02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:17.390
You know that connection.

4789
02:13:17.600 --> 02:13:19.730
They want more than that physical,

4790
02:13:19.731 --> 02:13:20.870
raw interaction.

4791
02:13:20.871 --> 02:13:22.250
They want something emotional.

4792
02:13:22.340 --> 02:13:22.581
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

4793
02:13:22.581 --> 02:13:23.930
there's always going to be that,

4794
02:13:23.931 --> 02:13:25.730
but they would like to fuck as well.

4795
02:13:25.940 --> 02:13:26.660
That's true.

4796
02:13:26.660 --> 02:13:29.810
The problem is a lot of times the girlfriend experience is 50 bucks.

4797
02:13:30.050 --> 02:13:31.010
Whereas the other thing,

4798
02:13:31.020 --> 02:13:34.100
if you want to actually have sex like 125 so you have to budget your,

4799
02:13:34.130 --> 02:13:34.950
you know,

4800
02:13:34.950 --> 02:13:36.340
if you're living in Japan and a tiny bit,

4801
02:13:36.350 --> 02:13:37.800
you're not buying it like you think,

4802
02:13:38.650 --> 02:13:38.970
no,

4803
02:13:38.970 --> 02:13:39.760
this guys are,

4804
02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:41.760
they're cuddling because they do want a cuddle,

4805
02:13:41.761 --> 02:13:43.650
but they definitely want to move to the next level.

4806
02:13:43.710 --> 02:13:45.300
I don't think you're giving guys enough credit.

4807
02:13:45.330 --> 02:13:46.470
I think that guys,

4808
02:13:46.471 --> 02:13:46.950
I,

4809
02:13:46.950 --> 02:13:47.520
they liked,

4810
02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:52.170
they like to pretend like they don't have any emotional connection or want that

4811
02:13:52.171 --> 02:13:52.921
emotional connection,

4812
02:13:52.921 --> 02:13:53.820
but a lot of them want,

4813
02:13:53.880 --> 02:13:54.511
Oh yeah,

4814
02:13:54.511 --> 02:13:54.721
no,

4815
02:13:54.721 --> 02:13:55.471
don't get me wrong.

4816
02:13:55.471 --> 02:14:00.060
I'm not saying that men definitely want an emotional connection with a

4817
02:14:00.061 --> 02:14:02.520
girlfriend or a wife or a woman in their life.

4818
02:14:02.520 --> 02:14:02.910
What do you know?

4819
02:14:02.910 --> 02:14:04.140
Label it in any way you want,

4820
02:14:04.141 --> 02:14:05.430
but they also wanna fuck.

4821
02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:06.440
So yeah,

4822
02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:07.830
but if they can't get that,

4823
02:14:07.831 --> 02:14:09.060
if all they can get as coddling,

4824
02:14:09.090 --> 02:14:09.990
they'll say it's a calling,

4825
02:14:10.500 --> 02:14:12.150
but they would like a little bit more.

4826
02:14:12.200 --> 02:14:13.170
This is natural.

4827
02:14:13.380 --> 02:14:16.920
Why would someone be affectionate with me but not want to please me all the way

4828
02:14:16.921 --> 02:14:19.360
or get rid of this throbbing thing.

4829
02:14:19.830 --> 02:14:20.663
Oh,

4830
02:14:20.730 --> 02:14:21.750
that's just a natural,

4831
02:14:21.751 --> 02:14:23.400
I mean it's his natural as like,

4832
02:14:23.760 --> 02:14:24.593
you know,

4833
02:14:24.780 --> 02:14:28.860
eating one piece of your food and wanting to eat the rest of it.

4834
02:14:29.180 --> 02:14:29.610
Yeah,

4835
02:14:29.610 --> 02:14:30.390
it's natural.

4836
02:14:30.390 --> 02:14:31.530
It's completely natural.

4837
02:14:31.790 --> 02:14:32.010
Yeah.

4838
02:14:32.010 --> 02:14:35.940
So like there was a thing recently where a woman was like making $90 an hour

4839
02:14:35.941 --> 02:14:37.050
cuddling with people.

4840
02:14:37.290 --> 02:14:37.720
She was like,

4841
02:14:37.720 --> 02:14:38.070
hi,

4842
02:14:38.070 --> 02:14:38.660
hi girl.

4843
02:14:38.660 --> 02:14:40.440
Out to cuddle with people.

4844
02:14:40.470 --> 02:14:40.771
That's,

4845
02:14:40.771 --> 02:14:42.960
I mean I couldn't do it but make money.

4846
02:14:43.010 --> 02:14:47.130
All I was thinking of like what a dangerous situation that is for the girl to be

4847
02:14:47.131 --> 02:14:49.550
with some man holding onto her like in,

4848
02:14:49.640 --> 02:14:51.480
in like very close proximity.

4849
02:14:51.810 --> 02:14:54.720
Like how many guys are just going to start beating off on her back.

4850
02:14:54.750 --> 02:14:57.270
You know how many guys are going to be cuddling with her and tried to rape her?

4851
02:14:57.271 --> 02:15:00.960
It's like I wouldn't trust a guy to cuddle with them like that.

4852
02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:03.030
I he has a guy wouldn't trust a guy.

4853
02:15:03.410 --> 02:15:03.840
Yeah,

4854
02:15:03.840 --> 02:15:04.980
we're not coddling dude.

4855
02:15:05.320 --> 02:15:05.621
<v 2>I don't,</v>

4856
02:15:05.621 --> 02:15:07.600
I don't know what the legality of that is,

4857
02:15:07.601 --> 02:15:11.230
but it does go back to the whole prostitution issue and how important it is to

4858
02:15:11.231 --> 02:15:14.920
legalize and regulate it and create a safe environment for women to do that type

4859
02:15:14.921 --> 02:15:18.070
of stuff so you can actually mitigate or minimize,

4860
02:15:18.340 --> 02:15:18.970
you know,

4861
02:15:18.970 --> 02:15:23.110
those types of instances where a guy will be abusive or do something degrading

4862
02:15:23.111 --> 02:15:23.940
or demeaning.

4863
02:15:23.940 --> 02:15:25.500
<v 4>The worry is also,</v>

4864
02:15:25.501 --> 02:15:29.100
I mean always that you're promoting it and then a few make prostitution,

4865
02:15:29.101 --> 02:15:30.400
legal and the people of God,

4866
02:15:30.401 --> 02:15:32.880
a prostitution that would never go to prostitution before.

4867
02:15:33.270 --> 02:15:34.103
So what

4868
02:15:35.940 --> 02:15:36.840
kind of woman are you?

4869
02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:37.670
Who are you?

4870
02:15:37.670 --> 02:15:41.580
I have a woman with an open fire with those lawyer women and all of you sell

4871
02:15:41.581 --> 02:15:42.840
your vagina's down the river.

4872
02:15:42.930 --> 02:15:43.763
Just sell them.

4873
02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:48.840
<v 2>I just feel like people who want to have relations with a prostitute or going to</v>

4874
02:15:48.961 --> 02:15:49.631
do it anyway.

4875
02:15:49.631 --> 02:15:53.470
And if legalizing prostitution somehow convinces someone who wouldn't otherwise

4876
02:15:53.471 --> 02:15:55.660
go to a prostitute to go through with it,

4877
02:15:55.960 --> 02:15:56.830
then okay.

4878
02:15:56.860 --> 02:15:58.450
Like there are worse things in the world.

4879
02:15:58.480 --> 02:15:59.110
It's just,

4880
02:15:59.110 --> 02:15:59.680
it's sad.

4881
02:15:59.680 --> 02:16:00.790
<v 4>So what I agree with,</v>

4882
02:16:00.791 --> 02:16:02.650
you mean obviously playing devil's advocate,

4883
02:16:02.651 --> 02:16:02.921
but yeah.

4884
02:16:02.921 --> 02:16:06.790
What was it that being on the show changed where you had this shift in your

4885
02:16:06.791 --> 02:16:08.130
attitude about legalized prostates?

4886
02:16:08.400 --> 02:16:11.940
<v 2>I worried about the safety of the women that put themselves in that situation</v>

4887
02:16:11.941 --> 02:16:15.150
and also the safety of men that put themselves in that situation.

4888
02:16:15.151 --> 02:16:17.100
Because if you regulate it,

4889
02:16:17.101 --> 02:16:20.850
you can ensure that these women are getting tested for STDs.

4890
02:16:21.090 --> 02:16:22.590
You don't want a bunch of people getting,

4891
02:16:22.620 --> 02:16:22.950
you know,

4892
02:16:22.950 --> 02:16:26.100
AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases,

4893
02:16:26.730 --> 02:16:27.380
pregnant,

4894
02:16:27.380 --> 02:16:27.900
you know,

4895
02:16:27.900 --> 02:16:29.160
a regulated industry.

4896
02:16:29.320 --> 02:16:31.730
This case would be much better than yeah.

4897
02:16:32.020 --> 02:16:32.620
You know,

4898
02:16:32.620 --> 02:16:37.620
criminalizing it and allowing people to harm themselves or be put in a harmful

4899
02:16:37.901 --> 02:16:38.470
situation.

4900
02:16:38.470 --> 02:16:39.303
And on top of that,

4901
02:16:39.460 --> 02:16:40.720
here's another thing I don't want to do.

4902
02:16:40.721 --> 02:16:44.540
I don't want to waste our resources on incarcerating people for these.

4903
02:16:44.541 --> 02:16:48.190
So called sex crimes because I don't see prostitution as a sex crime.

4904
02:16:48.191 --> 02:16:51.220
I see it as a normal human behavior.

4905
02:16:51.221 --> 02:16:52.150
People want sex.

4906
02:16:52.180 --> 02:16:54.310
Some people unfortunately have to pay for sex.

4907
02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:55.311
But if,

4908
02:16:55.311 --> 02:16:56.890
if that transaction has to happen,

4909
02:16:56.891 --> 02:16:57.671
let it happen.

4910
02:16:57.671 --> 02:16:58.660
Let it be regulated.

4911
02:16:58.661 --> 02:17:03.610
Let's get it off the streets and put it in a place that's safer.

4912
02:17:03.850 --> 02:17:05.500
That's just better for society.

4913
02:17:06.070 --> 02:17:06.341
<v 4>No,</v>

4914
02:17:06.341 --> 02:17:08.140
that's a totally rational way of looking at it.

4915
02:17:08.141 --> 02:17:08.500
Yeah.

4916
02:17:08.500 --> 02:17:09.333
And um,

4917
02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:13.750
unfortunately we have this weird attitude when it comes to sexuality and we have

4918
02:17:13.751 --> 02:17:15.640
this weird attitude when it comes to naked people.

4919
02:17:15.641 --> 02:17:15.850
I mean,

4920
02:17:15.850 --> 02:17:17.200
remember that Janet Jackson thing,

4921
02:17:17.201 --> 02:17:19.870
we showed a nickel on the super super bowl and everybody lost their fucking

4922
02:17:19.871 --> 02:17:20.261
mind.

4923
02:17:20.261 --> 02:17:20.500
Yup.

4924
02:17:20.500 --> 02:17:21.230
I remember.

4925
02:17:21.230 --> 02:17:23.050
We're really weird in that way.

4926
02:17:23.110 --> 02:17:25.090
It's okay to give someone a massage.

4927
02:17:25.091 --> 02:17:26.710
You could rub their feet to the cows.

4928
02:17:26.711 --> 02:17:27.910
Come home with oil.

4929
02:17:28.090 --> 02:17:28.781
You could rub them.

4930
02:17:28.781 --> 02:17:30.010
They can moan out loud.

4931
02:17:30.040 --> 02:17:31.450
Oh my God,

4932
02:17:31.460 --> 02:17:32.260
it smells so good.

4933
02:17:32.260 --> 02:17:33.250
Nobody has a problem with it.

4934
02:17:33.251 --> 02:17:33.941
Rubbed my back,

4935
02:17:33.941 --> 02:17:34.450
rub my,

4936
02:17:34.450 --> 02:17:35.770
but don't touch my dick.

4937
02:17:35.860 --> 02:17:36.910
Whoa.

4938
02:17:36.911 --> 02:17:38.020
That's a crime.

4939
02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:39.033
That's a crime.

4940
02:17:39.040 --> 02:17:41.860
Even though it would feel fantastic if you did,

4941
02:17:42.190 --> 02:17:43.023
can't do it.

4942
02:17:43.230 --> 02:17:44.063
He's against the book

4943
02:17:44.380 --> 02:17:44.650
<v 2>sitter.</v>

4944
02:17:44.650 --> 02:17:45.483
That cheating.

4945
02:17:45.670 --> 02:17:47.920
Like if you are married and um,

4946
02:17:48.100 --> 02:17:48.911
you will,

4947
02:17:48.911 --> 02:17:49.421
you are married.

4948
02:17:49.421 --> 02:17:52.330
But like if you were to go to a massage parlor and get that done,

4949
02:17:52.331 --> 02:17:53.500
would that be considered cheating?

4950
02:17:53.630 --> 02:17:56.150
<v 4>I definitely think it would get you in a lot of trouble.</v>

4951
02:17:56.750 --> 02:17:59.230
Of course it would get you into a lot is like a,

4952
02:17:59.300 --> 02:18:01.280
it seems like someone would not be happy about that,

4953
02:18:01.720 --> 02:18:03.170
but it would be awesome if they were,

4954
02:18:03.350 --> 02:18:05.390
if you could just go and what if they wear a mask?

4955
02:18:05.391 --> 02:18:06.640
Like one of those Mexican wrestlers,

4956
02:18:06.950 --> 02:18:08.450
they even know what they look like.

4957
02:18:08.690 --> 02:18:12.860
You go in there with like a wolf man mask on and then they could dress like a

4958
02:18:12.861 --> 02:18:13.790
Mexican wrestler.

4959
02:18:14.120 --> 02:18:15.230
You don't even look at each other.

4960
02:18:15.231 --> 02:18:20.231
You both wear sunglasses it seems so it's just like a massage in a situation

4961
02:18:20.271 --> 02:18:20.720
like that.

4962
02:18:20.720 --> 02:18:21.920
It's really not that different.

4963
02:18:22.190 --> 02:18:24.650
That's the reason why they do it at a massage parlor.

4964
02:18:24.740 --> 02:18:25.040
Right.

4965
02:18:25.040 --> 02:18:25.460
You know,

4966
02:18:25.460 --> 02:18:26.293
and the real,

4967
02:18:26.360 --> 02:18:31.280
the guys pro tips guys actually get a massage and then get a happy ending.

4968
02:18:31.340 --> 02:18:33.260
They don't just go right for the happy ending.

4969
02:18:33.460 --> 02:18:33.660
The,

4970
02:18:33.660 --> 02:18:33.881
the,

4971
02:18:33.881 --> 02:18:35.000
the legit pros,

4972
02:18:35.380 --> 02:18:36.010
they sit there,

4973
02:18:36.010 --> 02:18:37.760
they have a real massage first.

4974
02:18:38.150 --> 02:18:39.350
How the Japanese do it

4975
02:18:40.280 --> 02:18:40.521
<v 2>come up.</v>

4976
02:18:40.521 --> 02:18:44.490
Like how do you find a massage parlor that is willing to do that?

4977
02:18:44.780 --> 02:18:45.650
<v 4>There's websites.</v>

4978
02:18:45.770 --> 02:18:46.551
There are,

4979
02:18:46.551 --> 02:18:47.060
yes.

4980
02:18:47.060 --> 02:18:47.390
Yeah.

4981
02:18:47.390 --> 02:18:51.170
Fascinating websites that'll tell you where the spots are and you know,

4982
02:18:51.171 --> 02:18:55.610
like they'll rate places with stars and detailed their hand job experiences.

4983
02:18:55.940 --> 02:18:56.720
Wow.

4984
02:18:56.720 --> 02:18:58.550
And of course it doesn't just stop at a hand job.

4985
02:18:58.551 --> 02:19:00.050
It goes further than that in some cases.

4986
02:19:00.051 --> 02:19:00.320
Right.

4987
02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:03.270
Allegedly allegedly made.

4988
02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:03.890
Yeah.

4989
02:19:03.890 --> 02:19:04.191
It's,

4990
02:19:04.191 --> 02:19:09.191
it's one of those weird things where we've decided that people can do it for

4991
02:19:09.501 --> 02:19:11.120
free and no one gets hurt.

4992
02:19:11.320 --> 02:19:11.600
Yeah.

4993
02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:13.340
But if they do it for money,

4994
02:19:14.240 --> 02:19:15.110
it's illegal.

4995
02:19:15.170 --> 02:19:15.531
And then the,

4996
02:19:15.531 --> 02:19:15.701
I,

4997
02:19:15.701 --> 02:19:16.240
the,

4998
02:19:16.240 --> 02:19:18.560
the logic behind it is very weird.

4999
02:19:18.620 --> 02:19:21.020
And the logic behind the laws are,

5000
02:19:21.260 --> 02:19:21.771
you know,

5001
02:19:21.771 --> 02:19:22.071
there's,

5002
02:19:22.071 --> 02:19:24.620
there's more Allity ideas,

5003
02:19:24.650 --> 02:19:27.140
there's ethics ideas.

5004
02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:28.220
The reality

5005
02:19:28.220 --> 02:19:30.800
<v 0>is that money is going to be changing hands,</v>

5006
02:19:30.801 --> 02:19:31.760
whether you like it or not.

5007
02:19:31.761 --> 02:19:34.670
And most likely it's not going to get taxed unless it's legal.

5008
02:19:34.740 --> 02:19:35.030
Yeah.

5009
02:19:35.030 --> 02:19:37.820
It's just gonna it's gonna move into the economy.

5010
02:19:37.821 --> 02:19:39.050
And some sort of a weird way,

5011
02:19:39.290 --> 02:19:41.150
but the government in that,

5012
02:19:41.230 --> 02:19:43.280
in and also in drug laws,

5013
02:19:43.400 --> 02:19:45.710
they're fucking themselves out of massive amounts of revenue.

5014
02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:50.510
I know more on drugs is the most colossal fucking failure of a war in the hit

5015
02:19:50.720 --> 02:19:52.880
you guys during the time you're at war,

5016
02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:54.140
the business got bigger.

5017
02:19:54.320 --> 02:19:55.340
It got way huge,

5018
02:19:55.341 --> 02:19:56.690
are everywhere in the world.

5019
02:19:56.691 --> 02:20:00.500
It's a huge part of the economy and the business is become medical in

5020
02:20:00.501 --> 02:20:01.430
California,

5021
02:20:01.460 --> 02:20:02.840
very 16 other states,

5022
02:20:03.080 --> 02:20:04.700
legal in two states now,

5023
02:20:04.701 --> 02:20:05.870
now legal in Portland,

5024
02:20:05.871 --> 02:20:06.380
Maine.

5025
02:20:06.380 --> 02:20:07.370
It's the worst

5026
02:20:07.500 --> 02:20:08.880
<v 2>failure of a war ever.</v>

5027
02:20:08.881 --> 02:20:09.421
It is.

5028
02:20:09.421 --> 02:20:11.160
And when you look at the war on drugs,

5029
02:20:11.161 --> 02:20:12.840
specifically the war on marijuana,

5030
02:20:12.841 --> 02:20:17.550
very little of it has to do with stopping people from using these drugs.

5031
02:20:17.790 --> 02:20:21.930
Most of it has to do with paying for correctional officers,

5032
02:20:21.931 --> 02:20:23.880
paying for private prisons,

5033
02:20:24.120 --> 02:20:26.580
paying for private contractors,

5034
02:20:26.581 --> 02:20:31.320
even private contractors abroad who continue to amplify the war on drugs.

5035
02:20:31.440 --> 02:20:34.110
People are making a ton of money off this prohibition,

5036
02:20:34.230 --> 02:20:36.600
which is why it continues and it will never stop.

5037
02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:40.230
And I love that we're seeing the snowball effect with the legalization of

5038
02:20:40.231 --> 02:20:43.530
recreational marijuana or recreational use of marijuana.

5039
02:20:43.830 --> 02:20:44.430
Um,

5040
02:20:44.430 --> 02:20:48.780
there was recently a small town in the east coast that legalize it,

5041
02:20:48.781 --> 02:20:50.670
I believe it was in Maine.

5042
02:20:52.170 --> 02:20:52.531
Portland,

5043
02:20:52.531 --> 02:20:52.831
Maine.

5044
02:20:52.831 --> 02:20:53.061
Yeah,

5045
02:20:53.061 --> 02:20:53.641
it was Portland,

5046
02:20:53.641 --> 02:20:54.474
Maine.

5047
02:20:54.600 --> 02:20:57.990
They just legalized it and it was more of a symbolic thing because of course,

5048
02:20:57.991 --> 02:21:00.480
state laws and federal laws will Trump,

5049
02:21:00.750 --> 02:21:00.991
you know,

5050
02:21:00.991 --> 02:21:03.690
whatever municipal laws have been passed.

5051
02:21:03.960 --> 02:21:08.960
But I love that now politicians are forced to pay attention to the polls and

5052
02:21:09.241 --> 02:21:14.241
make changes because we're spending untold amounts of money just incarcerating

5053
02:21:15.061 --> 02:21:16.950
people for simple marijuana possession.

5054
02:21:16.951 --> 02:21:17.880
It's hideous.

5055
02:21:17.990 --> 02:21:22.160
<v 0>It is in the real problem with the war on drugs being with when you have</v>

5056
02:21:22.161 --> 02:21:23.030
marijuana illegal,

5057
02:21:23.031 --> 02:21:25.310
it means you're not getting that tax money from it.

5058
02:21:25.460 --> 02:21:27.320
Just like you're not getting it from prostitution.

5059
02:21:27.590 --> 02:21:27.741
You,

5060
02:21:27.741 --> 02:21:29.300
the government doesn't get their cut.

5061
02:21:29.360 --> 02:21:30.193
They're not getting it.

5062
02:21:30.260 --> 02:21:31.910
It's going to make its way into the economy.

5063
02:21:31.911 --> 02:21:32.541
In some ways,

5064
02:21:32.541 --> 02:21:33.830
like in BC,

5065
02:21:33.831 --> 02:21:34.760
in British Columbia,

5066
02:21:34.830 --> 02:21:39.020
there there's a huge issue because a giant chunk of their economies based on

5067
02:21:39.021 --> 02:21:39.800
marijuana,

5068
02:21:39.800 --> 02:21:41.120
but yet marijuana is illegal.

5069
02:21:41.340 --> 02:21:42.230
They arrest people.

5070
02:21:42.231 --> 02:21:43.190
But then let them go.

5071
02:21:43.191 --> 02:21:45.830
There's like a lot of weird fucking games going on up there,

5072
02:21:46.100 --> 02:21:47.540
but because it's illegal,

5073
02:21:47.630 --> 02:21:49.280
they're not getting their taxes from it.

5074
02:21:49.460 --> 02:21:50.480
It's a huge issue.

5075
02:21:50.570 --> 02:21:51.560
They know it's a giant.

5076
02:21:51.590 --> 02:21:54.980
There was a documentary that I was in called the union and it was all about,

5077
02:21:54.981 --> 02:21:55.791
that's what they call it.

5078
02:21:55.791 --> 02:21:56.750
They called the union.

5079
02:21:56.870 --> 02:21:58.070
When they talk about the,

5080
02:21:58.100 --> 02:21:58.421
the,

5081
02:21:58.421 --> 02:21:58.610
the,

5082
02:21:58.610 --> 02:22:01.130
all the different marijuana growers in BC.

5083
02:22:01.131 --> 02:22:05.210
It's like they're a multibillion dollar part of the economy up there.

5084
02:22:05.450 --> 02:22:09.800
So it's this weird hypocrisy that's going on where you have this thing that's a

5085
02:22:09.801 --> 02:22:12.230
huge part of why everybody's doing well.

5086
02:22:12.280 --> 02:22:12.470
Yep.

5087
02:22:12.470 --> 02:22:15.350
And that's things illegal and that thing's hurting no one.

5088
02:22:15.351 --> 02:22:16.220
And by the way,

5089
02:22:16.340 --> 02:22:17.270
because it's illegal,

5090
02:22:17.271 --> 02:22:18.350
you're not getting your cut.

5091
02:22:18.530 --> 02:22:20.810
<v 2>Do you know I'm about the Shaffer report.</v>

5092
02:22:20.960 --> 02:22:21.290
What's that?

5093
02:22:21.290 --> 02:22:21.740
During the,

5094
02:22:21.740 --> 02:22:22.130
Oh,

5095
02:22:22.130 --> 02:22:23.000
I love this story.

5096
02:22:23.001 --> 02:22:23.960
I love telling this story.

5097
02:22:24.230 --> 02:22:26.820
So during the Nixon administration,

5098
02:22:26.850 --> 02:22:30.060
Nixon wanted to commission a study on marijuana specifically.

5099
02:22:30.090 --> 02:22:30.780
Do you know about it?

5100
02:22:30.780 --> 02:22:31.950
Know about the Knicks and report Yada.

5101
02:22:31.951 --> 02:22:32.784
Yeah.

5102
02:22:32.940 --> 02:22:33.300
Yeah.

5103
02:22:33.300 --> 02:22:34.230
So he commissioned,

5104
02:22:34.231 --> 02:22:36.270
I believe he was a governor at the time as a politician.

5105
02:22:36.271 --> 02:22:36.811
With the last name,

5106
02:22:36.811 --> 02:22:37.644
Schaefer,

5107
02:22:37.650 --> 02:22:37.921
um,

5108
02:22:37.921 --> 02:22:39.300
to do the study on marijuana.

5109
02:22:39.301 --> 02:22:39.741
So Shaffer,

5110
02:22:39.741 --> 02:22:39.900
go,

5111
02:22:39.900 --> 02:22:40.800
went ahead and did it.

5112
02:22:41.190 --> 02:22:46.190
And he found that marijuana had no real long term negative effects on society or

5113
02:22:47.161 --> 02:22:48.660
human health or anything like that.

5114
02:22:48.661 --> 02:22:50.400
It just was not a threat to society,

5115
02:22:50.401 --> 02:22:51.234
period.

5116
02:22:51.570 --> 02:22:52.403
Nixon,

5117
02:22:52.500 --> 02:22:55.800
the same freaking person who commissioned that report took it,

5118
02:22:55.801 --> 02:22:56.790
ripped it up and said,

5119
02:22:56.791 --> 02:22:57.390
no,

5120
02:22:57.390 --> 02:22:59.970
I'm going to amplify the war on drugs.

5121
02:22:59.971 --> 02:23:03.210
I'm going to continue making this legal illegal.

5122
02:23:03.211 --> 02:23:06.300
I'm going to continue criminalizing people who have simple possession of it.

5123
02:23:06.540 --> 02:23:07.021
And Nixon,

5124
02:23:07.021 --> 02:23:07.261
I mean,

5125
02:23:07.261 --> 02:23:08.970
of course he did a lot of hideous things,

5126
02:23:09.180 --> 02:23:13.950
but that had so many negative ramifications in the country.

5127
02:23:14.160 --> 02:23:18.900
That's what led to this explosion of the for profit prison industry.

5128
02:23:19.110 --> 02:23:20.490
And now that industry,

5129
02:23:20.491 --> 02:23:21.031
first of all,

5130
02:23:21.031 --> 02:23:25.500
I don't know why it's called for profit or private prisons because they're

5131
02:23:25.501 --> 02:23:27.000
funded by tax dollars.

5132
02:23:27.001 --> 02:23:28.080
So how are they private?

5133
02:23:28.290 --> 02:23:29.041
And on top of that,

5134
02:23:29.041 --> 02:23:32.370
now we have an incentive to lock people away because these companies make money

5135
02:23:32.371 --> 02:23:33.204
off of it.

5136
02:23:33.210 --> 02:23:34.043
It's sick.

5137
02:23:34.390 --> 02:23:34.571
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

5138
02:23:34.571 --> 02:23:36.010
Private prisons are very scary.

5139
02:23:36.220 --> 02:23:38.800
It's very scary that not only do we have private prisons,

5140
02:23:38.801 --> 02:23:43.801
but you have private prison lobbies and you have guard lobbies were prison

5141
02:23:43.841 --> 02:23:44.470
guards.

5142
02:23:44.470 --> 02:23:48.340
Make sure that certain things stay illegal so that they can ensure that they

5143
02:23:48.341 --> 02:23:49.150
have work.

5144
02:23:49.150 --> 02:23:49.660
Yeah,

5145
02:23:49.660 --> 02:23:50.530
that slaves,

5146
02:23:50.770 --> 02:23:51.670
you're making slaves.

5147
02:23:51.700 --> 02:23:52.181
I mean you,

5148
02:23:52.181 --> 02:23:54.880
you want people to be locked up more than not locked up.

5149
02:23:55.300 --> 02:23:56.021
In my opinion,

5150
02:23:56.021 --> 02:23:58.240
if it's not robbery or violent crime,

5151
02:23:58.330 --> 02:23:59.980
those are the two things that I'm worried about.

5152
02:24:00.040 --> 02:24:01.570
Robbery or violent crime.

5153
02:24:01.750 --> 02:24:04.000
That's when you need to remove people from society.

5154
02:24:04.270 --> 02:24:07.100
Everything else should be on some sort of a penalty thing.

5155
02:24:07.340 --> 02:24:07.551
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

5156
02:24:07.551 --> 02:24:08.840
I mean the IBS demeanor,

5157
02:24:08.940 --> 02:24:09.773
citations,

5158
02:24:10.640 --> 02:24:11.181
<v 4>what is it?</v>

5159
02:24:11.181 --> 02:24:11.901
What's going on?

5160
02:24:11.901 --> 02:24:12.141
I mean,

5161
02:24:12.141 --> 02:24:12.350
did,

5162
02:24:12.350 --> 02:24:13.310
what did you not do?

5163
02:24:13.311 --> 02:24:14.510
Did you not pay your taxes?

5164
02:24:14.690 --> 02:24:16.220
Why do you get locked up for that?

5165
02:24:16.400 --> 02:24:17.330
That sounds crazy.

5166
02:24:17.331 --> 02:24:18.830
Why don't don't you just owe taxes.

5167
02:24:18.950 --> 02:24:20.330
How about you make them pay?

5168
02:24:20.510 --> 02:24:22.970
Because when you learned them making any money,

5169
02:24:23.150 --> 02:24:24.380
why are you profiting off?

5170
02:24:24.500 --> 02:24:25.460
How are you doing that?

5171
02:24:25.490 --> 02:24:28.250
You're locking them up and that's better than getting money from them while

5172
02:24:28.251 --> 02:24:28.331
they're,

5173
02:24:28.331 --> 02:24:28.420
yeah,

5174
02:24:28.420 --> 02:24:29.050
<v 2>working.</v>

5175
02:24:29.050 --> 02:24:29.261
Well,

5176
02:24:29.261 --> 02:24:32.710
we're doing the same thing with people who are undocumented immigrants,

5177
02:24:32.711 --> 02:24:32.951
right?

5178
02:24:32.951 --> 02:24:34.180
So they'll come into this country,

5179
02:24:34.181 --> 02:24:35.080
they're undocumented.

5180
02:24:35.081 --> 02:24:36.490
We find out they're undocumented.

5181
02:24:36.491 --> 02:24:37.990
And instead of deporting them,

5182
02:24:37.991 --> 02:24:39.130
which is what we used to do,

5183
02:24:39.370 --> 02:24:44.370
we will detain them for x amount of years and spend our resources on imprisoning

5184
02:24:44.771 --> 02:24:45.400
them,

5185
02:24:45.400 --> 02:24:47.680
which doesn't make any sense at all.

5186
02:24:47.740 --> 02:24:48.790
And I get it like you,

5187
02:24:48.791 --> 02:24:49.120
you might.

5188
02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:49.361
Okay.

5189
02:24:49.361 --> 02:24:51.070
We want to punish them and show them like,

5190
02:24:51.071 --> 02:24:51.491
you can't,

5191
02:24:51.491 --> 02:24:52.630
you can't do this again,

5192
02:24:52.900 --> 02:24:55.630
but you punish them by deporting them.

5193
02:24:55.930 --> 02:24:56.741
You know what I mean?

5194
02:24:56.741 --> 02:24:56.981
And,

5195
02:24:56.981 --> 02:24:57.850
and that's it.

5196
02:24:57.880 --> 02:24:58.061
Like,

5197
02:24:58.061 --> 02:25:02.170
why would you want to incarcerate them and spend tax dollars on that?

5198
02:25:02.320 --> 02:25:06.190
Especially when we're having this huge issue with public education right now.

5199
02:25:06.490 --> 02:25:07.270
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

5200
02:25:07.270 --> 02:25:08.050
It's a,

5201
02:25:08.050 --> 02:25:12.220
it's a weird little fake thing that we have going on where we pretend that la

5202
02:25:12.221 --> 02:25:14.080
doesn't have 10 million illegal immigrants.

5203
02:25:14.380 --> 02:25:15.191
We just kind of like,

5204
02:25:15.191 --> 02:25:15.761
Whoa,

5205
02:25:15.761 --> 02:25:16.271
you know,

5206
02:25:16.271 --> 02:25:17.110
whatever.

5207
02:25:17.260 --> 02:25:18.550
Now they're allowed to go to college.

5208
02:25:18.551 --> 02:25:21.280
At least there's a long time where,

5209
02:25:21.310 --> 02:25:21.720
uh,

5210
02:25:21.720 --> 02:25:22.630
immigrants,

5211
02:25:22.750 --> 02:25:26.830
where are children of immigrants or immigrants that came over and their children

5212
02:25:26.831 --> 02:25:29.350
were born in Mexico but live their entire lives here in America.

5213
02:25:29.650 --> 02:25:30.790
They weren't allowed to go to college.

5214
02:25:30.860 --> 02:25:31.281
<v 2>I know.</v>

5215
02:25:31.281 --> 02:25:33.560
So I'm happy that California passed the Dream Act.

5216
02:25:33.561 --> 02:25:35.840
It's ridiculous that we haven't been able to do that

5217
02:25:36.080 --> 02:25:36.920
<v 4>federal level.</v>

5218
02:25:36.940 --> 02:25:37.130
Yeah,

5219
02:25:37.130 --> 02:25:38.780
absolutely disgusting.

5220
02:25:38.870 --> 02:25:39.770
What is America?

5221
02:25:39.860 --> 02:25:41.090
It's not a nation of immigrants.

5222
02:25:41.091 --> 02:25:41.451
I mean that,

5223
02:25:41.451 --> 02:25:42.620
that's all we are.

5224
02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:47.030
We are a bunch of people that came here from other put into penalize a baby or

5225
02:25:47.031 --> 02:25:47.870
to say that,

5226
02:25:47.871 --> 02:25:48.201
well,

5227
02:25:48.201 --> 02:25:48.771
you know what?

5228
02:25:48.771 --> 02:25:49.341
The parents,

5229
02:25:49.341 --> 02:25:52.310
they brought the kid over here so the kid can sponge off the kids a part of the

5230
02:25:52.311 --> 02:25:52.911
fucking system.

5231
02:25:52.911 --> 02:25:53.040
Yeah.

5232
02:25:53.040 --> 02:25:54.470
They call them anchor babies.

5233
02:25:54.800 --> 02:25:55.191
By the way.

5234
02:25:55.191 --> 02:25:56.780
The parents are part of the system to,

5235
02:25:56.781 --> 02:25:57.650
they're working here.

5236
02:25:57.900 --> 02:25:58.500
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

5237
02:25:58.500 --> 02:26:02.130
I hate the argument that they don't pay taxes in a lot of cases,

5238
02:26:02.131 --> 02:26:03.450
especially in California.

5239
02:26:03.690 --> 02:26:05.730
I mean they pay taxes in the form of,

5240
02:26:05.731 --> 02:26:06.151
first of all,

5241
02:26:06.151 --> 02:26:07.230
they pay social security,

5242
02:26:07.231 --> 02:26:09.900
but then they never get a dime of that social security later.

5243
02:26:10.110 --> 02:26:10.441
Right.

5244
02:26:10.441 --> 02:26:12.780
So there are contributing to the social security system.

5245
02:26:12.990 --> 02:26:16.860
And on top of that they're paying for state taxes as well or sales taxes.

5246
02:26:16.910 --> 02:26:17.040
Yeah.

5247
02:26:17.040 --> 02:26:18.240
So they do pay taxes,

5248
02:26:18.241 --> 02:26:19.770
they do contribute to society.

5249
02:26:19.950 --> 02:26:21.210
And I'm not trying to,

5250
02:26:21.230 --> 02:26:21.480
you know,

5251
02:26:21.480 --> 02:26:25.890
make excuses or to justify coming into the country illegally.

5252
02:26:25.891 --> 02:26:29.670
But if you've been here for decades and you've had your children here,

5253
02:26:30.010 --> 02:26:30.300
there,

5254
02:26:30.300 --> 02:26:34.860
we need to create some sort of comprehensive immigration reform.

5255
02:26:35.220 --> 02:26:39.900
And right now we have clowns and office that can't seem to agree on anything and

5256
02:26:39.901 --> 02:26:41.430
refuse to work with one another.

5257
02:26:41.431 --> 02:26:43.560
So I feel like it's going to be difficult for that to happen.

5258
02:26:43.561 --> 02:26:47.790
But I feel like something like the dream act is common sense.

5259
02:26:47.791 --> 02:26:50.010
It shouldn't even be a political issue.

5260
02:26:50.011 --> 02:26:51.900
It shouldn't be a partisan issue.

5261
02:26:52.170 --> 02:26:53.070
You should just do it.

5262
02:26:53.590 --> 02:26:53.861
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

5263
02:26:53.861 --> 02:26:56.000
I completely wholeheartedly agree.

5264
02:26:56.050 --> 02:26:59.650
And I think there's also this weird thing where we're connected to a third world

5265
02:26:59.651 --> 02:27:00.910
country by a fence.

5266
02:27:01.350 --> 02:27:06.350
I mean we are right next door to the biggest war on drugs and all of the world

5267
02:27:06.490 --> 02:27:08.110
playing out on our border.

5268
02:27:08.410 --> 02:27:10.660
And then right across there you have intense,

5269
02:27:10.661 --> 02:27:11.860
extreme poverty.

5270
02:27:12.070 --> 02:27:13.780
If you take a car from San Diego,

5271
02:27:13.781 --> 02:27:18.781
you can go from La Jolla where you will have the most elegant clifftop mansions

5272
02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:20.230
that will blow your mind.

5273
02:27:20.231 --> 02:27:22.000
Just these great Gatsby houses.

5274
02:27:22.001 --> 02:27:22.630
We like,

5275
02:27:22.630 --> 02:27:23.710
oh my goodness.

5276
02:27:23.711 --> 02:27:28.600
Like this fucking giant circular driveway with enormous found you like what a

5277
02:27:28.601 --> 02:27:33.601
house in 20 minutes you're in Tiawana 20 fucking minutes and you might just just

5278
02:27:34.421 --> 02:27:38.010
get there while these cartel members are dropping off headless bodies in the

5279
02:27:38.011 --> 02:27:40.720
lining them up on the street with signs on them or you know,

5280
02:27:40.721 --> 02:27:45.160
you might see a brothel where you can go fuck some immigrant for a a dollar that

5281
02:27:45.161 --> 02:27:47.460
made their way up from El Salvador or,

5282
02:27:47.461 --> 02:27:51.550
or Peru or Mexico is the promise land for them.

5283
02:27:51.551 --> 02:27:55.660
There are hoping to get to Mexico because they live in the jungle somewhere in

5284
02:27:55.661 --> 02:27:56.420
Ecuador.

5285
02:27:56.420 --> 02:27:56.570
They,

5286
02:27:56.570 --> 02:28:01.570
I mean it's the extreme intense poverty and extreme intense violence and we're

5287
02:28:02.201 --> 02:28:03.880
just sort of like not dealing with it.

5288
02:28:04.060 --> 02:28:05.140
<v 2>We're not dealing with it,</v>

5289
02:28:05.141 --> 02:28:09.760
but we're actually fueling that type of system here in the United States

5290
02:28:09.950 --> 02:28:11.270
<v 4>by keeping marijuana illegal.</v>

5291
02:28:11.271 --> 02:28:12.490
We certainly are keeping

5292
02:28:12.490 --> 02:28:16.180
<v 2>marijuana illegal and also through our current fiscal policy,</v>

5293
02:28:16.480 --> 02:28:16.871
you know,

5294
02:28:16.871 --> 02:28:21.871
by allowing companies like Walmart to basically pay full time employee so little

5295
02:28:23.721 --> 02:28:28.580
that the government has to subsidize their healthcare or food stamps,

5296
02:28:28.581 --> 02:28:29.301
whatever it is,

5297
02:28:29.301 --> 02:28:31.640
just so they can make ends meet like we have,

5298
02:28:31.641 --> 02:28:34.760
we have that system here now and we need to do something to change.

5299
02:28:34.930 --> 02:28:37.780
<v 0>That's exactly what they were protesting about during the WTO thing.</v>

5300
02:28:37.920 --> 02:28:39.610
<v 2>It goes all back to Alex Jones.</v>

5301
02:28:39.830 --> 02:28:41.170
I told you Joe Rogan

5302
02:28:41.830 --> 02:28:43.270
<v 0>that that's what he was,</v>

5303
02:28:43.271 --> 02:28:43.750
uh,

5304
02:28:43.750 --> 02:28:44.110
his,

5305
02:28:44.110 --> 02:28:44.980
his document,

5306
02:28:44.981 --> 02:28:45.940
I think it was nine one,

5307
02:28:45.941 --> 02:28:47.470
one a road to tyranny.

5308
02:28:47.500 --> 02:28:48.670
It was all about that.

5309
02:28:48.671 --> 02:28:52.390
It was all about how this is like an established pattern of behavior and you

5310
02:28:52.391 --> 02:28:52.780
know,

5311
02:28:52.780 --> 02:28:56.260
this agent provocateur thing that they do to break up peaceful protests.

5312
02:28:56.500 --> 02:28:59.620
The World Trade Organization meeting was just about that very thing.

5313
02:28:59.780 --> 02:29:03.490
This is about moving jobs to these other places and figuring out how to set up

5314
02:29:03.491 --> 02:29:05.080
shop and third world countries.

5315
02:29:05.081 --> 02:29:06.580
You can pay people dirt wages.

5316
02:29:06.670 --> 02:29:07.420
Yeah.

5317
02:29:07.420 --> 02:29:07.721
Yeah.

5318
02:29:07.721 --> 02:29:09.490
I don't know how that's going to get fixed.

5319
02:29:09.520 --> 02:29:09.821
Do you,

5320
02:29:09.821 --> 02:29:10.301
when you,

5321
02:29:10.301 --> 02:29:12.820
when you cover this stuff on a daily basis,

5322
02:29:12.821 --> 02:29:16.900
I mean you guys are covering more serious issues and we are mover basically just

5323
02:29:16.901 --> 02:29:20.020
fucking around and finding things in the Internet that I find are interesting.

5324
02:29:20.290 --> 02:29:23.920
But you guys are like covering like some pretty legit stories and getting pretty

5325
02:29:23.921 --> 02:29:24.700
in India.

5326
02:29:24.700 --> 02:29:26.440
Do you see any light at the end of the tunnel?

5327
02:29:26.441 --> 02:29:29.170
Do you see like a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow for all this?

5328
02:29:29.280 --> 02:29:32.100
<v 2>I do see a light at the end of the tunnel,</v>

5329
02:29:32.101 --> 02:29:37.101
but we really need a revolution and I'm not calling for violence and I'm not

5330
02:29:37.111 --> 02:29:37.950
inciting violence.

5331
02:29:37.951 --> 02:29:42.951
But I think that there has to come a point where we hit rock bottom and the

5332
02:29:43.651 --> 02:29:46.470
political activism actually makes a difference.

5333
02:29:46.740 --> 02:29:47.011
You know,

5334
02:29:47.011 --> 02:29:49.740
the political activism needs to exist to begin with,

5335
02:29:49.741 --> 02:29:50.161
by the way,

5336
02:29:50.161 --> 02:29:51.450
because it doesn't even exist now.

5337
02:29:51.540 --> 02:29:51.751
I mean,

5338
02:29:51.751 --> 02:29:55.800
we're at a point where the government can literally do whatever it wants and no

5339
02:29:55.801 --> 02:29:57.270
one will make a peep out of it.

5340
02:29:57.480 --> 02:29:58.890
The NSA can spy on us.

5341
02:29:59.130 --> 02:30:04.130
The Obama Administration can go drop a drone or do a drone strike on an American

5342
02:30:04.621 --> 02:30:09.621
citizen and his 16 year old son and no one will say a damn thing about it.

5343
02:30:10.620 --> 02:30:12.210
That's the country we're living in right now.

5344
02:30:12.211 --> 02:30:13.860
Or civil liberties are being destroyed.

5345
02:30:14.190 --> 02:30:15.060
Our fiscal policy.

5346
02:30:15.061 --> 02:30:15.894
Does it make sense?

5347
02:30:16.560 --> 02:30:19.440
We need people to be politically active and we need to get money out of

5348
02:30:19.441 --> 02:30:20.100
politics.

5349
02:30:20.100 --> 02:30:21.930
Those are the two things that mattered the most.

5350
02:30:22.080 --> 02:30:24.260
<v 0>Do you think there's also the aspect of the,</v>

5351
02:30:24.261 --> 02:30:28.430
the amount of information that we're getting overwhelmed with on a daily basis?

5352
02:30:28.700 --> 02:30:32.510
When you think about a story about the American citizen that was targeted,

5353
02:30:32.690 --> 02:30:33.171
that was the,

5354
02:30:33.171 --> 02:30:33.441
the,

5355
02:30:33.441 --> 02:30:34.580
the Ottawa or I'll,

5356
02:30:34.630 --> 02:30:35.640
I'll walk hottie got.

5357
02:30:35.641 --> 02:30:35.901
Yeah.

5358
02:30:35.901 --> 02:30:36.140
Yeah.

5359
02:30:36.140 --> 02:30:38.900
And it killed his son with drones and you know,

5360
02:30:38.901 --> 02:30:39.860
he was an American.

5361
02:30:39.861 --> 02:30:40.041
I mean,

5362
02:30:40.041 --> 02:30:41.000
they didn't try them.

5363
02:30:41.001 --> 02:30:42.020
They just assassinating them.

5364
02:30:42.510 --> 02:30:43.190
Uh,

5365
02:30:43.190 --> 02:30:44.870
is there too many stories coming in?

5366
02:30:44.871 --> 02:30:45.081
I mean,

5367
02:30:45.081 --> 02:30:48.440
go to cnn.com right now and you'll see a fucking million of them on the front

5368
02:30:48.441 --> 02:30:48.980
page.

5369
02:30:48.980 --> 02:30:49.161
Yeah,

5370
02:30:49.161 --> 02:30:49.310
no,

5371
02:30:49.310 --> 02:30:50.180
go to Yahoo.

5372
02:30:50.181 --> 02:30:52.640
Go to all these new sites and you're like,

5373
02:30:53.060 --> 02:30:54.260
God damn,

5374
02:30:54.660 --> 02:30:54.880
<v 2>that's,</v>

5375
02:30:54.880 --> 02:30:56.470
that's part of the problem.

5376
02:30:56.471 --> 02:30:57.280
But I mean the,

5377
02:30:57.280 --> 02:30:59.230
most of these stories are important news stories.

5378
02:30:59.231 --> 02:30:59.501
Yeah.

5379
02:30:59.501 --> 02:31:01.390
There's a lot of bullshit sprinkled in there.

5380
02:31:01.780 --> 02:31:02.110
Um,

5381
02:31:02.110 --> 02:31:03.910
but a huge problem is,

5382
02:31:03.911 --> 02:31:04.270
you know,

5383
02:31:04.270 --> 02:31:05.320
every American I,

5384
02:31:05.321 --> 02:31:05.680
I'm,

5385
02:31:05.680 --> 02:31:08.890
I have the luxury of keeping up with this stuff because it's my job.

5386
02:31:09.190 --> 02:31:12.940
A lot of Americans don't have that luxury because they're working 12 hour

5387
02:31:13.100 --> 02:31:13.933
workdays.

5388
02:31:14.080 --> 02:31:14.411
You know,

5389
02:31:14.411 --> 02:31:14.831
they're,

5390
02:31:14.831 --> 02:31:19.350
they're working a few different jobs just to provide for their families who hell

5391
02:31:19.351 --> 02:31:21.510
is going to go home after a long day of work.

5392
02:31:21.630 --> 02:31:26.630
Sit down and read all of these news stories much less understand the nuance of

5393
02:31:27.301 --> 02:31:28.410
these new stories.

5394
02:31:28.440 --> 02:31:31.890
That's a difficult thing to do and it's a lot to ask of the American people.

5395
02:31:32.070 --> 02:31:36.240
But the way that you can fix that is by creating a media,

5396
02:31:36.241 --> 02:31:41.040
a form of media that is informative with no corporate interests.

5397
02:31:41.130 --> 02:31:45.630
Because right now the gold standard of news is still the MSNBC,

5398
02:31:45.631 --> 02:31:46.261
CNN,

5399
02:31:46.261 --> 02:31:46.891
Fox News.

5400
02:31:46.891 --> 02:31:49.090
It's the stuff that you just turn on you,

5401
02:31:49.100 --> 02:31:51.930
you watch it in the background while you're trying to feed your kids and take

5402
02:31:51.931 --> 02:31:52.830
care of your family.

5403
02:31:52.980 --> 02:31:55.920
And that's problematic because a lot of those networks will spread

5404
02:31:55.921 --> 02:31:59.160
misinformation or they have a particular agenda.

5405
02:31:59.430 --> 02:32:00.360
And as a result,

5406
02:32:00.361 --> 02:32:02.790
they will only cover the news that fits their agenda.

5407
02:32:02.850 --> 02:32:04.020
And there's an issue with that.

5408
02:32:04.230 --> 02:32:08.130
But hopefully new media will grow to the point where it'll take over that system

5409
02:32:08.131 --> 02:32:08.964
and it'll,

5410
02:32:09.080 --> 02:32:09.690
you know,

5411
02:32:09.690 --> 02:32:13.740
educate people enough to where they will want to stand up for their rights and

5412
02:32:13.741 --> 02:32:15.480
they will want to be politically active.

5413
02:32:15.750 --> 02:32:18.330
I'm teaching a class at cal state Northridge right now.

5414
02:32:18.331 --> 02:32:19.530
It's a journalism class.

5415
02:32:19.680 --> 02:32:20.760
Prepare for stalkers.

5416
02:32:21.300 --> 02:32:22.133
Cockers are coming.

5417
02:32:22.440 --> 02:32:23.640
I have a private security.

5418
02:32:23.641 --> 02:32:24.474
It'll be fine.

5419
02:32:25.260 --> 02:32:25.820
Um,

5420
02:32:25.820 --> 02:32:26.730
double up on that now.

5421
02:32:28.650 --> 02:32:29.090
Um,

5422
02:32:29.090 --> 02:32:32.160
and I remember when I first started teaching the class,

5423
02:32:32.161 --> 02:32:36.120
I asked every single one of the students to tell me what they find most

5424
02:32:36.121 --> 02:32:37.080
interesting in media.

5425
02:32:37.081 --> 02:32:38.190
What do they want to cover,

5426
02:32:38.191 --> 02:32:39.024
what's their beat?

5427
02:32:39.360 --> 02:32:42.210
And the vast majority of them were like entertainment,

5428
02:32:42.211 --> 02:32:42.631
news,

5429
02:32:42.631 --> 02:32:43.051
sports,

5430
02:32:43.051 --> 02:32:43.501
news,

5431
02:32:43.501 --> 02:32:43.771
you know,

5432
02:32:43.771 --> 02:32:45.390
stuff that's really easy to cover.

5433
02:32:45.391 --> 02:32:46.440
And very profitable.

5434
02:32:46.441 --> 02:32:48.150
So I don't blame them for wanting to do that.

5435
02:32:48.420 --> 02:32:53.420
But I wanted to instill in them a type of intellectual curiosity where they

5436
02:32:53.731 --> 02:32:56.820
would want to know about what's going on in the political world,

5437
02:32:56.970 --> 02:32:59.730
where they would want to be these mini political activists.

5438
02:32:59.731 --> 02:33:00.610
And I don't do it in,

5439
02:33:00.611 --> 02:33:02.310
in the sense that I tell them,

5440
02:33:02.311 --> 02:33:02.491
hey,

5441
02:33:02.491 --> 02:33:03.540
you gotta be progressive.

5442
02:33:03.630 --> 02:33:05.400
I definitely shy away from that,

5443
02:33:05.700 --> 02:33:09.990
but I want them to look at news stories critically and question the way that

5444
02:33:09.991 --> 02:33:10.890
they're being covered.

5445
02:33:11.220 --> 02:33:14.880
So that's like my little tiny bit of trying to make a difference.

5446
02:33:14.881 --> 02:33:15.990
And I love doing that.

5447
02:33:16.020 --> 02:33:16.651
Being a,

5448
02:33:16.651 --> 02:33:19.860
an instructor at a university is a very thankless job.

5449
02:33:20.100 --> 02:33:22.740
I've learned that this semester since it's my first time doing it.

5450
02:33:23.070 --> 02:33:23.903
But you gotta,

5451
02:33:23.910 --> 02:33:25.350
you gotta start by,

5452
02:33:25.410 --> 02:33:26.010
you know,

5453
02:33:26.010 --> 02:33:28.680
changing the way people learn about journalism,

5454
02:33:28.681 --> 02:33:32.250
changing the way they cover stories and you got to get people to be critical

5455
02:33:32.251 --> 02:33:33.084
thinkers.

5456
02:33:33.400 --> 02:33:33.600
Okay.

5457
02:33:33.600 --> 02:33:35.730
<v 0>Or at least tried to inspire them to be,</v>

5458
02:33:35.731 --> 02:33:36.000
I mean,

5459
02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:37.980
it's just really tough to get someone to do anything.

5460
02:33:38.100 --> 02:33:38.581
<v 2>It is,</v>

5461
02:33:38.581 --> 02:33:38.970
it is,

5462
02:33:38.970 --> 02:33:39.481
it is tough.

5463
02:33:39.481 --> 02:33:41.940
But I will say I open every class with a production meeting,

5464
02:33:41.941 --> 02:33:45.060
like we do mock production meetings similar to what you would do in a newsroom.

5465
02:33:45.630 --> 02:33:50.370
And the type of stories that they pitch now are very different from what they

5466
02:33:50.371 --> 02:33:52.290
started pitching in the beginning of the semester.

5467
02:33:52.291 --> 02:33:54.360
So they're way more politically minded,

5468
02:33:54.361 --> 02:33:55.194
which I love.

5469
02:33:55.380 --> 02:33:57.240
All of a sudden they're bringing up the Glenn Greenwald,

5470
02:33:57.241 --> 02:33:59.070
Edward Snowden type stories and I'm like,

5471
02:33:59.250 --> 02:34:00.120
yes.

5472
02:34:00.390 --> 02:34:03.540
Like that's a little bit of a difference and it makes me very happy.

5473
02:34:03.541 --> 02:34:03.900
Happy.

5474
02:34:03.900 --> 02:34:04.711
<v 0>Do you feel like,</v>

5475
02:34:04.711 --> 02:34:06.840
because I mean you do this for a living,

5476
02:34:06.870 --> 02:34:10.530
but do you think that you can even keep up with all the shit that's happening on

5477
02:34:10.531 --> 02:34:11.364
a daily basis?

5478
02:34:11.480 --> 02:34:12.000
No.

5479
02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:13.380
Have a regular person.

5480
02:34:13.710 --> 02:34:14.640
It's difficult.

5481
02:34:14.641 --> 02:34:15.480
It's difficult.

5482
02:34:15.540 --> 02:34:16.231
How can they,

5483
02:34:16.231 --> 02:34:16.930
I mean it's,

5484
02:34:16.930 --> 02:34:18.040
it's almost impossible to

5485
02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:18.880
<v 3>be informed today.</v>

5486
02:34:19.150 --> 02:34:20.140
It's almost impossible.

5487
02:34:20.350 --> 02:34:21.670
And it truly informed,

5488
02:34:21.880 --> 02:34:22.450
I think.

5489
02:34:22.450 --> 02:34:22.810
I don't,

5490
02:34:22.810 --> 02:34:23.860
I don't think it's impossible.

5491
02:34:23.861 --> 02:34:25.090
I think it's overwhelming,

5492
02:34:25.120 --> 02:34:28.360
but I don't think it's impossible as a responsibility.

5493
02:34:28.361 --> 02:34:30.790
How much do you have a responsibility to be informed?

5494
02:34:30.791 --> 02:34:31.211
Not You,

5495
02:34:31.211 --> 02:34:35.650
but like a regular person with a regular job and a family and God forbid if you

5496
02:34:35.651 --> 02:34:36.490
have a fucking hobby.

5497
02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:38.980
But if you're working on something during the day,

5498
02:34:39.190 --> 02:34:43.570
what are the odds that you can pay attention to the top 10 news stories of the

5499
02:34:43.570 --> 02:34:46.120
day and form of really clear opinion on any of them.

5500
02:34:46.390 --> 02:34:47.680
It's very difficult.

5501
02:34:47.681 --> 02:34:49.150
We're fucked too many hours,

5502
02:34:49.800 --> 02:34:50.560
but you know what?

5503
02:34:50.560 --> 02:34:52.040
Here's the thing and I'm going to,

5504
02:34:52.390 --> 02:34:54.070
people are not going to like what I'm about to say.

5505
02:34:54.100 --> 02:34:56.590
Oh everyone loves distractions.

5506
02:34:56.620 --> 02:34:59.530
Like how much time do we spend on social media?

5507
02:34:59.531 --> 02:35:03.360
How much time do we spend watching reality shows and doing things that we want

5508
02:35:03.361 --> 02:35:03.520
to do?

5509
02:35:03.520 --> 02:35:05.140
Cause we just want to shut our brains off.

5510
02:35:05.170 --> 02:35:07.630
We want to numb ourselves to what's going on in the world,

5511
02:35:07.631 --> 02:35:08.260
right?

5512
02:35:08.260 --> 02:35:09.460
Instead of doing that,

5513
02:35:09.490 --> 02:35:11.020
maybe we should change the culture.

5514
02:35:11.021 --> 02:35:14.680
So people will want to use that very precious time and that very precious

5515
02:35:14.681 --> 02:35:15.514
resource,

5516
02:35:15.820 --> 02:35:16.180
uh,

5517
02:35:16.180 --> 02:35:17.080
to be informed.

5518
02:35:17.081 --> 02:35:19.690
They want to use it for that as opposed to being,

5519
02:35:19.750 --> 02:35:20.480
you know,

5520
02:35:20.480 --> 02:35:24.850
I think distracted problem that people have with being informed over being

5521
02:35:24.851 --> 02:35:28.930
distracted is that it's incredibly frustrating and you feel helpless when you

5522
02:35:28.931 --> 02:35:32.230
start reading all these stories about the stock market manipulations about the

5523
02:35:32.231 --> 02:35:37.231
banks being bailed out and about bailouts where the fucking people that were

5524
02:35:37.961 --> 02:35:41.830
involved in the bail out somehow or another warranted some crazy commission.

5525
02:35:42.070 --> 02:35:45.370
They got some bonus of the gut and then the president said is going to limit to

5526
02:35:45.371 --> 02:35:46.340
a half a million dollars.

5527
02:35:46.341 --> 02:35:48.130
He's like a fucking half a million dollars is a lot of money,

5528
02:35:48.131 --> 02:35:48.490
man.

5529
02:35:48.490 --> 02:35:50.070
What do you mean you're limiting it to a half of them?

5530
02:35:50.200 --> 02:35:51.730
Didn't we just give them a ton of money?

5531
02:35:51.970 --> 02:35:55.510
You feel helpless when you read about this shit over and over and over again.

5532
02:35:55.511 --> 02:35:58.030
When you watched documentaries on fracking,

5533
02:35:58.031 --> 02:35:58.690
when you,

5534
02:35:58.690 --> 02:35:58.991
you know,

5535
02:35:58.991 --> 02:36:01.620
you read stories in the news about how,

5536
02:36:01.621 --> 02:36:05.560
how poorly veterans are being taken care of when they come back from war and

5537
02:36:05.770 --> 02:36:09.160
there's so many different things that you read where it doesn't make sense.

5538
02:36:09.250 --> 02:36:09.641
I know,

5539
02:36:09.641 --> 02:36:12.820
but when you look at all of these new stories,

5540
02:36:12.821 --> 02:36:16.330
there's always one underlying issue in every new story.

5541
02:36:16.331 --> 02:36:21.331
It's kind of amazing and it always goes back to who is funding these

5542
02:36:21.371 --> 02:36:22.480
politicians,

5543
02:36:22.810 --> 02:36:23.140
right?

5544
02:36:23.140 --> 02:36:24.910
If you get the money out of politics,

5545
02:36:24.911 --> 02:36:25.780
that virus,

5546
02:36:25.781 --> 02:36:27.640
if you destroy that virus,

5547
02:36:27.850 --> 02:36:32.260
things will change quickly because our representatives will be forced to pay

5548
02:36:32.261 --> 02:36:33.490
attention to the American people,

5549
02:36:33.491 --> 02:36:36.490
the people that are voting for them as opposed to the people who are paying

5550
02:36:36.491 --> 02:36:37.180
them.

5551
02:36:37.180 --> 02:36:37.451
You know,

5552
02:36:37.451 --> 02:36:41.050
if you get rid of that type of bribery that we're dealing with right now,

5553
02:36:41.650 --> 02:36:43.930
the entire system needs to be changed,

5554
02:36:44.340 --> 02:36:45.240
unquestionably.

5555
02:36:45.250 --> 02:36:46.600
But how does that ever happen?

5556
02:36:46.810 --> 02:36:46.970
I mean,

5557
02:36:46.970 --> 02:36:48.170
it doesn't mean we,

5558
02:36:48.250 --> 02:36:51.550
you have to like get them to change it themselves as well.

5559
02:36:51.700 --> 02:36:53.160
How else is it going to get changed?

5560
02:36:53.410 --> 02:36:54.243
Here's the thing.

5561
02:36:54.250 --> 02:36:54.730
Um,

5562
02:36:54.730 --> 02:36:56.950
Congress is obviously very corrupt.

5563
02:36:56.980 --> 02:36:57.813
So Congress,

5564
02:36:58.960 --> 02:37:03.960
this is America there obviously I'm very much bought by corporations and as a

5565
02:37:06.461 --> 02:37:06.821
result,

5566
02:37:06.821 --> 02:37:09.400
it's really difficult for them to propose any real change.

5567
02:37:09.580 --> 02:37:11.320
But when it comes to the state level,

5568
02:37:11.321 --> 02:37:12.730
when it comes to state legislators,

5569
02:37:12.731 --> 02:37:13.630
it's a little different.

5570
02:37:13.930 --> 02:37:15.830
So we actually managed to get,

5571
02:37:15.890 --> 02:37:16.140
I'm

5572
02:37:16.140 --> 02:37:20.630
<v 2>a state representative from Texas to propose a resolution for a constitutional</v>

5573
02:37:20.631 --> 02:37:21.111
convention.

5574
02:37:21.111 --> 02:37:23.570
And it goes back to what I was saying earlier about wolf pack.

5575
02:37:24.050 --> 02:37:25.430
And if we get,

5576
02:37:25.520 --> 02:37:25.821
you know,

5577
02:37:25.821 --> 02:37:29.780
state state representatives from all the states to agree to this constitutional

5578
02:37:29.781 --> 02:37:30.614
convention,

5579
02:37:30.770 --> 02:37:34.520
then we can actually have this constitutional amendment to get money out of

5580
02:37:34.521 --> 02:37:35.000
politics.

5581
02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:36.350
It's possible.

5582
02:37:36.680 --> 02:37:38.390
We just need to inform people about it.

5583
02:37:38.810 --> 02:37:42.020
wolf-pack.wolf-pack.com

5584
02:37:42.020 --> 02:37:42.680
<v 0>get on it.</v>

5585
02:37:42.680 --> 02:37:43.011
Well,

5586
02:37:43.011 --> 02:37:44.430
I hope you're right and I,

5587
02:37:44.431 --> 02:37:44.751
I'm,

5588
02:37:44.751 --> 02:37:45.740
I'm very hopeful.

5589
02:37:46.250 --> 02:37:46.790
I just,

5590
02:37:46.790 --> 02:37:51.710
I think that it's incredibly difficult to get venom out of the system and then

5591
02:37:51.711 --> 02:37:52.320
once,

5592
02:37:52.320 --> 02:37:53.390
once it's in there,

5593
02:37:53.420 --> 02:37:54.530
it's in there pretty deep.

5594
02:37:54.560 --> 02:37:57.830
It's going to be very hard to heal this poisoned system.

5595
02:37:58.250 --> 02:38:01.310
And the people that are accustomed extracting money,

5596
02:38:01.460 --> 02:38:01.711
they,

5597
02:38:01.711 --> 02:38:05.780
they mean that's a giant part of their motivation for being in the position when

5598
02:38:05.781 --> 02:38:06.310
they're in,

5599
02:38:06.310 --> 02:38:07.143
in the first place.

5600
02:38:07.160 --> 02:38:07.340
Yeah.

5601
02:38:07.340 --> 02:38:10.130
Now all of a sudden they're there and they can extract money anymore.

5602
02:38:10.520 --> 02:38:11.061
Then you gotta go,

5603
02:38:11.061 --> 02:38:13.940
why kind of Hippie bullshit is this?

5604
02:38:13.970 --> 02:38:16.790
All of a sudden they're going to have to pay attention to the people that voted

5605
02:38:16.791 --> 02:38:17.181
for them.

5606
02:38:17.181 --> 02:38:18.440
That's crazy.

5607
02:38:18.470 --> 02:38:20.480
They get to a point where they can't do that anymore.

5608
02:38:20.481 --> 02:38:24.170
I think that's one of the things that we need is we need new young politicians.

5609
02:38:24.171 --> 02:38:25.670
I think that's hugely,

5610
02:38:25.671 --> 02:38:26.630
hugely important.

5611
02:38:27.040 --> 02:38:27.890
Until that happened,

5612
02:38:28.030 --> 02:38:29.620
<v 2>and principled politicians,</v>

5613
02:38:29.621 --> 02:38:30.790
I mean you'll have some Paul,

5614
02:38:30.820 --> 02:38:35.820
some candidates who will run a campaign and they're genuine in how they want to

5615
02:38:37.091 --> 02:38:37.721
change the system.

5616
02:38:37.721 --> 02:38:39.280
I think Obama is an example of that.

5617
02:38:39.281 --> 02:38:43.000
I think he was genuine to begin with and then they enter the system and they're

5618
02:38:43.001 --> 02:38:45.550
corrupted by what we have to deal with.

5619
02:38:45.850 --> 02:38:49.240
They're corrupted by the money in politics and I mean,

5620
02:38:49.270 --> 02:38:50.170
what are you going to do?

5621
02:38:50.171 --> 02:38:50.921
At the end of the day,

5622
02:38:50.921 --> 02:38:51.580
you got to,

5623
02:38:51.580 --> 02:38:53.500
you got to run for reelection.

5624
02:38:53.890 --> 02:38:54.850
You need the funds,

5625
02:38:54.851 --> 02:38:55.330
right,

5626
02:38:55.330 --> 02:38:58.480
and you're going to get the funds from corporations and then you have to

5627
02:38:58.481 --> 02:39:02.200
basically get down on your knees and do whatever the corporation's need you to

5628
02:39:02.201 --> 02:39:02.580
do.

5629
02:39:02.580 --> 02:39:03.660
<v 0>That's my opinion.</v>

5630
02:39:03.661 --> 02:39:04.590
I'm with you on this,

5631
02:39:04.591 --> 02:39:09.180
but I talked to Sam Harris who I respect very greatly and his opinion is very

5632
02:39:09.181 --> 02:39:09.810
different.

5633
02:39:09.810 --> 02:39:13.050
He believes that there's so many dangerous people in the world that Obama got

5634
02:39:13.051 --> 02:39:16.710
into office then immediately realized how fucking scary the world is and then

5635
02:39:16.711 --> 02:39:18.900
started tightening down drone attacks,

5636
02:39:19.440 --> 02:39:20.040
cut,

5637
02:39:20.040 --> 02:39:20.791
cut down on sort of,

5638
02:39:20.791 --> 02:39:21.500
I mean it started,

5639
02:39:21.500 --> 02:39:22.020
uh,

5640
02:39:22.020 --> 02:39:23.670
cut down on whistle blowers,

5641
02:39:23.820 --> 02:39:25.140
surveillance ups,

5642
02:39:25.260 --> 02:39:25.490
all,

5643
02:39:25.490 --> 02:39:27.210
all the things that he did once he got into office,

5644
02:39:27.211 --> 02:39:30.300
that what explains that has reversed on Guantanamo Bay.

5645
02:39:30.960 --> 02:39:35.150
He believes that it's because the stack of papers that he gets on his desk every

5646
02:39:35.151 --> 02:39:36.300
day of memos,

5647
02:39:36.301 --> 02:39:37.890
telling them what's been avoided,

5648
02:39:37.891 --> 02:39:38.100
what,

5649
02:39:38.100 --> 02:39:39.300
how fucked up the world is,

5650
02:39:39.450 --> 02:39:41.730
what dangers we're facing on a regular basis,

5651
02:39:41.910 --> 02:39:43.950
who we need to attack before the attack us.

5652
02:39:44.310 --> 02:39:46.110
That they're just trying to avoid another lot,

5653
02:39:46.140 --> 02:39:46.870
nine 11.

5654
02:39:46.870 --> 02:39:49.540
<v 2>I don't know if I'm really buying that argument.</v>

5655
02:39:49.541 --> 02:39:54.520
I think that we have this military industrial complex and I think that Obama

5656
02:39:54.521 --> 02:39:57.460
does not want to seem weak when it comes to national security.

5657
02:39:57.461 --> 02:40:00.160
So as a result he will do things that are extreme.

5658
02:40:00.340 --> 02:40:00.551
I mean,

5659
02:40:00.551 --> 02:40:02.830
if you're really concerned about national security,

5660
02:40:03.010 --> 02:40:07.990
it's very curious for you to go about keeping the country safe by causing so

5661
02:40:07.991 --> 02:40:12.991
much hostility toward the u s think about that we are bombing and doing drone

5662
02:40:13.921 --> 02:40:18.921
strikes on innocent civilians abroad that creates hostility toward the United

5663
02:40:19.410 --> 02:40:21.780
States that makes people want to attack us.

5664
02:40:22.170 --> 02:40:22.800
So,

5665
02:40:22.800 --> 02:40:23.520
I mean,

5666
02:40:23.520 --> 02:40:23.731
I,

5667
02:40:23.731 --> 02:40:25.230
I'm not really buying that.

5668
02:40:25.231 --> 02:40:25.471
You know,

5669
02:40:25.471 --> 02:40:27.150
Obama got in and he got scared.

5670
02:40:27.151 --> 02:40:30.120
I think that people are making money off what's going on abroad right now.

5671
02:40:30.420 --> 02:40:31.253
And I,

5672
02:40:31.270 --> 02:40:32.103
I,

5673
02:40:32.130 --> 02:40:35.370
I think that Obama is worried about seeming weak to Republicans.

5674
02:40:35.371 --> 02:40:35.581
I mean,

5675
02:40:35.581 --> 02:40:37.980
when you look at almost all of his policies,

5676
02:40:38.220 --> 02:40:40.470
he's always been so afraid of Republican's,

5677
02:40:40.471 --> 02:40:41.550
which drives me crazy.

5678
02:40:41.551 --> 02:40:45.600
The only thing that he's really had a good stance on was gay marriage.

5679
02:40:45.780 --> 02:40:48.930
And that was after what years of being president.

5680
02:40:48.960 --> 02:40:50.160
He finally came out and said,

5681
02:40:50.161 --> 02:40:50.671
yeah,

5682
02:40:50.671 --> 02:40:52.230
I guess I've changed my mind.

5683
02:40:52.410 --> 02:40:53.610
Civil unions aren't enough.

5684
02:40:53.611 --> 02:40:55.200
We should have same sex marriage.

5685
02:40:55.290 --> 02:40:55.471
Well,

5686
02:40:55.471 --> 02:40:56.700
if you really believe that,

5687
02:40:56.701 --> 02:40:59.190
then we should do something on the federal level.

5688
02:40:59.280 --> 02:41:00.840
This is not a states' rights issue.

5689
02:41:00.841 --> 02:41:01.920
This is a federal issue.

5690
02:41:01.921 --> 02:41:03.420
This is a civil rights issue.

5691
02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:07.680
<v 4>I feel like gay rights and gay marriage is one of those beach ball they toss up</v>

5692
02:41:07.681 --> 02:41:08.514
at a concert,

5693
02:41:08.610 --> 02:41:11.450
totally has to keep in the air because it keeps everybody distracted.

5694
02:41:11.460 --> 02:41:12.181
Gay Marriage,

5695
02:41:12.181 --> 02:41:13.800
oh no more tone.

5696
02:41:14.220 --> 02:41:16.590
And they keep bouncing this stupid beach ball around

5697
02:41:16.880 --> 02:41:19.580
<v 2>and the and politicians are now using it for political gain,</v>

5698
02:41:19.581 --> 02:41:20.930
which is really frustrating.

5699
02:41:21.290 --> 02:41:21.981
You know what I mean?

5700
02:41:21.981 --> 02:41:22.190
It's,

5701
02:41:22.190 --> 02:41:22.761
Oh look,

5702
02:41:22.761 --> 02:41:23.600
it turns out that,

5703
02:41:23.630 --> 02:41:23.930
you know,

5704
02:41:23.930 --> 02:41:26.240
the majority of Americans are in favor of gay rights.

5705
02:41:26.241 --> 02:41:27.920
So let's change our stance on that.

5706
02:41:28.090 --> 02:41:28.520
There's,

5707
02:41:28.520 --> 02:41:29.750
they're not principled.

5708
02:41:29.960 --> 02:41:30.311
And in,

5709
02:41:30.311 --> 02:41:32.810
in that case it's a good thing because I want gay rights,

5710
02:41:33.020 --> 02:41:33.680
but I just,

5711
02:41:33.680 --> 02:41:35.480
politicians will be politicians,

5712
02:41:35.510 --> 02:41:35.901
you know,

5713
02:41:35.901 --> 02:41:36.041
and,

5714
02:41:36.041 --> 02:41:37.580
and a lot of them lack,

5715
02:41:38.310 --> 02:41:38.670
<v 4>well,</v>

5716
02:41:38.670 --> 02:41:40.110
it's always been said that they're like,

5717
02:41:40.140 --> 02:41:45.140
it's like politics are show business for ugly people and actors are notorious

5718
02:41:45.451 --> 02:41:49.110
for sticking their finger in the air and finding out which way the wind blows

5719
02:41:49.111 --> 02:41:53.430
culturally and then saying things that they don't necessarily believe in or

5720
02:41:53.431 --> 02:41:55.710
necessarily have even researched.

5721
02:41:56.010 --> 02:41:58.470
And that's hugely common when you're on sets.

5722
02:41:58.590 --> 02:42:03.360
There's always these dumb Bimbo actors that have opinions and males more than

5723
02:42:03.361 --> 02:42:04.020
females,

5724
02:42:04.020 --> 02:42:04.471
Bimbo,

5725
02:42:04.471 --> 02:42:05.190
males,

5726
02:42:05.190 --> 02:42:08.640
and they'll have these opinions on something political or will the will the

5727
02:42:08.641 --> 02:42:09.350
Democrats won.

5728
02:42:09.350 --> 02:42:09.870
It was like,

5729
02:42:09.870 --> 02:42:11.700
what the fuck are you even talking about?

5730
02:42:11.960 --> 02:42:12.960
You're talking nonsense.

5731
02:42:13.020 --> 02:42:17.850
Did you just like read a a front page article in Salon for five seconds and now

5732
02:42:17.851 --> 02:42:19.680
all of a sudden you're going to tell us what's wrong with the world?

5733
02:42:20.660 --> 02:42:23.070
What they do is try to appear liberal.

5734
02:42:23.250 --> 02:42:26.070
They try to appear progressive cause they're not even human.

5735
02:42:26.130 --> 02:42:26.340
Yeah.

5736
02:42:26.340 --> 02:42:29.030
There are some weird form that like they're,

5737
02:42:29.040 --> 02:42:34.040
they're like a mold that like in grab human flesh and fucking fake it and they

5738
02:42:34.321 --> 02:42:37.920
can walk through life pretending to have regular emotions and regular feelings.

5739
02:42:38.170 --> 02:42:38.641
Meanwhile,

5740
02:42:38.641 --> 02:42:41.490
they're just trying to get people to give them the next job,

5741
02:42:41.580 --> 02:42:44.910
trying to get people to like them enough to cast them in the next TV show or

5742
02:42:44.911 --> 02:42:45.744
movie or whatever.

5743
02:42:45.810 --> 02:42:47.390
They're barely even alive there.

5744
02:42:47.400 --> 02:42:48.270
These Weirdos,

5745
02:42:48.390 --> 02:42:50.850
and I think politicians are very much the same way.

5746
02:42:51.120 --> 02:42:52.980
Obviously there's a massive generalization.

5747
02:42:52.981 --> 02:42:54.150
This is not all actors.

5748
02:42:54.151 --> 02:42:55.320
I met a lot of cool actors,

5749
02:42:55.590 --> 02:42:58.920
but I have met a lot of fucking Weirdos that are like Stepford wives are like

5750
02:42:58.921 --> 02:42:59.820
robot people.

5751
02:42:59.970 --> 02:43:03.600
They'll like some Weirdo who's just trying to be whatever work,

5752
02:43:03.750 --> 02:43:04.561
whatever pants.

5753
02:43:04.561 --> 02:43:06.750
Where do I have to have fake rips on my jeans?

5754
02:43:06.751 --> 02:43:07.110
What?

5755
02:43:07.110 --> 02:43:08.160
What's the new thing?

5756
02:43:08.160 --> 02:43:08.431
You know?

5757
02:43:08.431 --> 02:43:09.570
Should I wear a nose ring?

5758
02:43:09.571 --> 02:43:09.841
No.

5759
02:43:09.841 --> 02:43:10.674
Nose rings are out.

5760
02:43:10.770 --> 02:43:10.990
I mean,

5761
02:43:10.990 --> 02:43:13.570
they're on the fucking whatever the edge is.

5762
02:43:13.571 --> 02:43:15.820
Everyone's wearing what everybody else is wearing.

5763
02:43:15.970 --> 02:43:17.530
Do you remember when those von Dutch hats,

5764
02:43:17.531 --> 02:43:18.364
we're going around,

5765
02:43:18.540 --> 02:43:20.990
they had those fucking stupid trucker hats and you're like,

5766
02:43:21.310 --> 02:43:22.540
what are you doing?

5767
02:43:22.840 --> 02:43:26.590
You have a fucking stupid trucker hat on and everybody's got them.

5768
02:43:26.650 --> 02:43:27.910
I just thought of Ashton Kutcher.

5769
02:43:27.911 --> 02:43:29.530
Anytime I think of Chuck Chuck or hats,

5770
02:43:29.531 --> 02:43:31.630
I think of Ashton Kutcher who was young man at a time.

5771
02:43:31.631 --> 02:43:32.464
I don't fault him,

5772
02:43:32.580 --> 02:43:37.330
but I think it's that sort of a thing where you get that in politics as well.

5773
02:43:37.420 --> 02:43:40.360
You get a human that's not even really a human with the AR.

5774
02:43:40.361 --> 02:43:41.194
Is this,

5775
02:43:41.260 --> 02:43:41.621
this,

5776
02:43:41.621 --> 02:43:46.621
this thing that's leaning towards whatever Polk gravity or the wind or the,

5777
02:43:47.111 --> 02:43:47.491
the,

5778
02:43:47.491 --> 02:43:47.681
the,

5779
02:43:47.681 --> 02:43:49.330
the rush of the water beneath their feet.

5780
02:43:49.331 --> 02:43:50.170
Whatever the fuck it is.

5781
02:43:50.171 --> 02:43:51.330
It's pulling in one direction and the,

5782
02:43:51.460 --> 02:43:53.290
there's no stability is no base,

5783
02:43:53.350 --> 02:43:54.370
no real ethics.

5784
02:43:54.610 --> 02:43:55.930
And when they do have ethics,

5785
02:43:55.931 --> 02:43:57.150
they look fucking crazy.

5786
02:43:57.151 --> 02:43:58.270
They look like Ron Paul,

5787
02:43:58.730 --> 02:43:59.081
some,

5788
02:43:59.081 --> 02:43:59.591
some nutty.

5789
02:43:59.591 --> 02:44:03.720
Do they look like some Gary Johnson from New Mexico fringe character?

5790
02:44:03.970 --> 02:44:04.301
<v 2>Well,</v>

5791
02:44:04.301 --> 02:44:04.810
I mean,

5792
02:44:04.810 --> 02:44:08.890
I think there have been politicians in the past who had ethics and people will

5793
02:44:08.891 --> 02:44:09.760
look down on them.

5794
02:44:10.060 --> 02:44:10.360
Um,

5795
02:44:10.360 --> 02:44:10.600
but,

5796
02:44:10.600 --> 02:44:10.731
uh,

5797
02:44:10.731 --> 02:44:14.230
a perfect example of a politician that actually gets a lot of respect as

5798
02:44:14.231 --> 02:44:15.160
Elizabeth Warren.

5799
02:44:15.380 --> 02:44:17.440
If Elizabeth Warren ran for president,

5800
02:44:17.590 --> 02:44:18.910
I'd be like Hillary,

5801
02:44:18.911 --> 02:44:19.744
who,

5802
02:44:19.930 --> 02:44:20.351
you know,

5803
02:44:20.351 --> 02:44:25.030
like she's an amazing person who actually stood up to the banks when it was an

5804
02:44:25.090 --> 02:44:26.470
unpopular thing to do.

5805
02:44:26.471 --> 02:44:29.530
And also when in this current system,

5806
02:44:29.531 --> 02:44:32.920
it's political suicide because these are the assholes that are supposed to fund

5807
02:44:32.921 --> 02:44:33.850
your campaigns,

5808
02:44:33.940 --> 02:44:34.720
right?

5809
02:44:34.720 --> 02:44:36.100
So Elizabeth Warren,

5810
02:44:36.101 --> 02:44:36.370
you know,

5811
02:44:36.370 --> 02:44:37.600
is an incredible senator.

5812
02:44:37.670 --> 02:44:40.060
I don't think that she's actually going to run for president,

5813
02:44:40.061 --> 02:44:45.061
but people are becoming more and more open to principled politicians because

5814
02:44:47.141 --> 02:44:48.070
it's refreshing.

5815
02:44:48.071 --> 02:44:48.550
It's,

5816
02:44:48.550 --> 02:44:48.880
I mean,

5817
02:44:48.880 --> 02:44:52.420
when this whole rob Ford Ford thing was happening in Toronto,

5818
02:44:52.930 --> 02:44:56.380
there were a number of supporters because they thought that it was refreshing.

5819
02:44:56.381 --> 02:44:57.430
That he was so honest,

5820
02:44:58.040 --> 02:45:00.230
<v 4>even though she's freaking crazy.</v>

5821
02:45:01.350 --> 02:45:02.160
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

5822
02:45:02.160 --> 02:45:03.000
But they're like,

5823
02:45:03.150 --> 02:45:03.421
yeah,

5824
02:45:03.421 --> 02:45:04.231
at least he's honest.

5825
02:45:04.231 --> 02:45:04.620
All right.

5826
02:45:04.620 --> 02:45:04.831
You know,

5827
02:45:04.831 --> 02:45:06.090
maybe we'll vote for him again.

5828
02:45:06.330 --> 02:45:06.751
<v 4>You know,</v>

5829
02:45:06.751 --> 02:45:07.401
it's amazing.

5830
02:45:07.401 --> 02:45:08.280
He smoke crack.

5831
02:45:08.610 --> 02:45:09.750
He was pretty awesome about it.

5832
02:45:09.990 --> 02:45:12.060
But if you look at a guy that's that fat,

5833
02:45:12.061 --> 02:45:13.590
he's this giant moon face.

5834
02:45:13.591 --> 02:45:14.520
Like he's wild.

5835
02:45:14.521 --> 02:45:16.650
He's kind of deals do anything so indulgent.

5836
02:45:16.910 --> 02:45:17.510
He is going,

5837
02:45:17.510 --> 02:45:18.880
he's doing with food look good.

5838
02:45:18.930 --> 02:45:20.040
He's doing to his body.

5839
02:45:20.041 --> 02:45:21.480
You think he's scared of some crack?

5840
02:45:21.790 --> 02:45:22.591
That guy's not secured.

5841
02:45:22.591 --> 02:45:23.071
If anything,

5842
02:45:23.071 --> 02:45:24.300
he'll just a smoke some crack.

5843
02:45:25.170 --> 02:45:25.590
Yeah.

5844
02:45:25.590 --> 02:45:26.030
Um,

5845
02:45:26.030 --> 02:45:29.640
I think that one of the things that this,

5846
02:45:29.670 --> 02:45:32.910
this shift that's happening with information,

5847
02:45:33.120 --> 02:45:35.610
one of the things it's going to be very fascinating about this erosion of

5848
02:45:35.611 --> 02:45:39.240
privacy is that you're going to get real honest politicians because they have no

5849
02:45:39.241 --> 02:45:39.920
choice.

5850
02:45:39.920 --> 02:45:40.850
<v 2>Exactly.</v>

5851
02:45:41.180 --> 02:45:44.840
You know what's amazing though is you'll have politicians that are on the record

5852
02:45:44.841 --> 02:45:48.770
saying one thing and then like a few months later they back pedal or they say

5853
02:45:48.771 --> 02:45:51.740
something or flip flop and they say something completely different and they

5854
02:45:51.741 --> 02:45:54.200
denied that they did a flip flop and it's like,

5855
02:45:54.230 --> 02:45:55.910
like Mitt Romney's an example of that.

5856
02:45:56.180 --> 02:45:59.810
There was evidence indicating that Mitt Romney supported planned parenthood and

5857
02:45:59.811 --> 02:46:00.950
then when he was running for president,

5858
02:46:00.951 --> 02:46:01.371
he's like,

5859
02:46:01.371 --> 02:46:03.290
I will shut planned parenthood down.

5860
02:46:03.291 --> 02:46:05.180
It's like you're on the record,

5861
02:46:05.181 --> 02:46:05.481
dude.

5862
02:46:05.481 --> 02:46:06.291
There's evidence.

5863
02:46:06.291 --> 02:46:09.950
Like how are you unaware of the Internet

5864
02:46:09.980 --> 02:46:13.850
<v 3>and how it holds you accountable to what you've done and said in the past?</v>

5865
02:46:13.930 --> 02:46:14.051
<v 0>Well,</v>

5866
02:46:14.051 --> 02:46:16.960
Mim Romney's still in denial that he's a first generation Mexican.

5867
02:46:17.230 --> 02:46:18.040
Yeah.

5868
02:46:18.040 --> 02:46:20.680
He's still in denial of his family living over in Mexico.

5869
02:46:21.080 --> 02:46:23.740
You remember who was talking about that like very briefly during the,

5870
02:46:23.741 --> 02:46:24.310
uh,

5871
02:46:24.310 --> 02:46:24.461
the,

5872
02:46:24.461 --> 02:46:24.651
the,

5873
02:46:24.651 --> 02:46:27.910
the campaign that his father actually was born in Mexico and everybody was like,

5874
02:46:27.911 --> 02:46:28.744
what?

5875
02:46:28.920 --> 02:46:30.350
And then you get deep into when you're fine.

5876
02:46:30.351 --> 02:46:30.550
Like,

5877
02:46:30.550 --> 02:46:30.731
Oh,

5878
02:46:30.731 --> 02:46:32.660
your dad was in a sex cult.

5879
02:46:33.090 --> 02:46:35.400
<v 7>Oh</v>

5880
02:46:35.560 --> 02:46:36.460
<v 0>Wow.</v>

5881
02:46:36.490 --> 02:46:37.930
Mitt Romney was a character.

5882
02:46:38.320 --> 02:46:39.220
He still is.

5883
02:46:39.250 --> 02:46:39.880
Yeah.

5884
02:46:39.880 --> 02:46:40.031
Yeah.

5885
02:46:40.031 --> 02:46:41.950
He was the governor of Massachusetts for a long time.

5886
02:46:41.951 --> 02:46:42.671
People loved them.

5887
02:46:42.671 --> 02:46:43.510
Did a good job.

5888
02:46:43.720 --> 02:46:44.560
Some people loved them.

5889
02:46:44.770 --> 02:46:45.071
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

5890
02:46:45.071 --> 02:46:45.821
I mean he,

5891
02:46:45.821 --> 02:46:46.381
his colleague,

5892
02:46:46.381 --> 02:46:49.840
he had healthcare in Massachusetts.

5893
02:46:49.841 --> 02:46:53.230
It's very similar to the affordable care act and then he went off and started

5894
02:46:53.231 --> 02:46:54.910
criticizing the affordable care act.

5895
02:46:54.911 --> 02:46:56.290
It's like amazing to me.

5896
02:46:56.480 --> 02:46:56.811
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

5897
02:46:56.811 --> 02:46:58.850
He would have fucked up as soon as he got an office too.

5898
02:46:58.851 --> 02:46:59.810
I think all of them,

5899
02:46:59.811 --> 02:47:00.860
once they get in there,

5900
02:47:00.890 --> 02:47:01.670
they just,

5901
02:47:01.670 --> 02:47:02.990
they just get taken down.

5902
02:47:03.080 --> 02:47:03.471
You know,

5903
02:47:03.471 --> 02:47:03.661
they,

5904
02:47:03.661 --> 02:47:03.901
they,

5905
02:47:03.901 --> 02:47:08.901
they get sat down and they get spelled out how the world really works and they

5906
02:47:09.171 --> 02:47:12.200
probably have hints of it before they actually get in there.

5907
02:47:12.350 --> 02:47:15.440
But once they get in there and they meet with the fucking Bilderberg group and

5908
02:47:15.441 --> 02:47:19.040
they meet with the international bankers that control the world's economy and

5909
02:47:19.041 --> 02:47:20.110
they just realize the,

5910
02:47:20.310 --> 02:47:21.860
the depth of the puzzle,

5911
02:47:22.010 --> 02:47:22.401
it's probably,

5912
02:47:22.401 --> 02:47:24.470
I mean that's why they all go gray like instantly.

5913
02:47:24.530 --> 02:47:24.891
Oh yeah.

5914
02:47:24.891 --> 02:47:26.840
Oklahoma has aged so much.

5915
02:47:26.900 --> 02:47:28.040
It's kind of incredible.

5916
02:47:28.070 --> 02:47:32.050
When it'd be amazing if he did like an Eisenhower type for like,

5917
02:47:32.140 --> 02:47:36.530
like a final speech when Eisenhower warned of the uh,

5918
02:47:36.550 --> 02:47:38.510
the military industrial complex.

5919
02:47:38.700 --> 02:47:39.260
If,

5920
02:47:39.260 --> 02:47:40.011
if Obama,

5921
02:47:40.011 --> 02:47:40.421
all these,

5922
02:47:40.421 --> 02:47:40.550
yeah.

5923
02:47:40.550 --> 02:47:43.110
<v 3>If Obama warned about the military does no callbacks,</v>

5924
02:47:43.140 --> 02:47:44.540
that would be very funny

5925
02:47:44.630 --> 02:47:46.160
<v 0>if he got on TV and just said,</v>

5926
02:47:46.161 --> 02:47:46.581
listen,

5927
02:47:46.581 --> 02:47:48.680
I've been bullshitting you people for eight years.

5928
02:47:49.310 --> 02:47:51.770
Like this system is fucking crazy.

5929
02:47:51.830 --> 02:47:52.010
Yeah.

5930
02:47:52.010 --> 02:47:53.180
Move to Canada.

5931
02:47:53.690 --> 02:47:55.580
That would be move to Hawaii.

5932
02:47:55.670 --> 02:47:56.930
I'm going back there too.

5933
02:47:57.200 --> 02:47:58.220
<v 3>He never would though.</v>

5934
02:47:58.600 --> 02:48:01.400
I mean even though he doesn't have to worry about getting reelected again,

5935
02:48:01.430 --> 02:48:04.130
Democrats are holding him accountable.

5936
02:48:04.131 --> 02:48:06.830
They don't want to look bad because they want to make sure another Democrat gets

5937
02:48:06.831 --> 02:48:08.000
elected and it's all,

5938
02:48:08.001 --> 02:48:09.290
it's all bs.

5939
02:48:09.291 --> 02:48:13.310
It's the same as long as our system is dealing with that virus.

5940
02:48:13.311 --> 02:48:15.620
As long as our system has the money in politics,

5941
02:48:15.790 --> 02:48:18.590
it doesn't matter if you're voting for a Democrat or Republican,

5942
02:48:18.620 --> 02:48:19.401
it's the same.

5943
02:48:19.401 --> 02:48:20.210
At the end of the day,

5944
02:48:20.210 --> 02:48:22.310
they might be different with social issues.

5945
02:48:22.400 --> 02:48:25.550
They might be a little different when it comes to fiscal policy.

5946
02:48:25.551 --> 02:48:27.650
Although Obama is not a good example of him being,

5947
02:48:27.651 --> 02:48:27.861
you know,

5948
02:48:27.861 --> 02:48:29.660
different when it comes to fiscal policy.

5949
02:48:29.970 --> 02:48:30.470
Um,

5950
02:48:30.470 --> 02:48:33.200
they're not different when it comes to international policy.

5951
02:48:34.110 --> 02:48:39.110
<v 0>I'm a little happier when a Democrats in office because of what I think they do</v>

5952
02:48:39.391 --> 02:48:42.150
socially when it comes to things like gay marriage or,

5953
02:48:42.151 --> 02:48:42.390
yeah.

5954
02:48:42.390 --> 02:48:44.550
Things like right to choose.

5955
02:48:44.551 --> 02:48:45.560
And the thing that,

5956
02:48:45.561 --> 02:48:46.650
things along those lines,

5957
02:48:46.651 --> 02:48:48.080
I feel like when the,

5958
02:48:48.210 --> 02:48:50.940
when you have a Republican in office,

5959
02:48:51.060 --> 02:48:52.770
those things tend to get squashed.

5960
02:48:52.790 --> 02:48:53.250
Yeah.

5961
02:48:53.250 --> 02:48:57.780
And I think that's one of the benefits of having a Democrat in office is the get

5962
02:48:57.781 --> 02:48:58.441
more quality,

5963
02:48:58.441 --> 02:48:59.450
especially when you're dealing with a,

5964
02:48:59.460 --> 02:49:01.380
a Democrat who also happens to be black.

5965
02:49:01.650 --> 02:49:03.390
I think it's good socially,

5966
02:49:03.780 --> 02:49:07.020
but then when you look at what he's done in comparison to what Bush has,

5967
02:49:07.290 --> 02:49:07.560
it's,

5968
02:49:07.560 --> 02:49:07.951
man,

5969
02:49:07.951 --> 02:49:08.100
it's

5970
02:49:08.100 --> 02:49:08.940
<v 4>real similar.</v>

5971
02:49:09.110 --> 02:49:09.270
Yeah.

5972
02:49:09.270 --> 02:49:12.360
Like it's hard to tell the difference between a Democrat and a Republican other

5973
02:49:12.361 --> 02:49:13.620
than the healthcare issue,

5974
02:49:13.920 --> 02:49:16.280
which seems to be a cluster fuck.

5975
02:49:16.410 --> 02:49:19.710
But I would imagine everything that you get started from scratch as a

5976
02:49:19.930 --> 02:49:20.640
clusterfuck.

5977
02:49:20.640 --> 02:49:22.230
I don't know why anybody would think that.

5978
02:49:22.231 --> 02:49:23.070
It wouldn't be a cluster.

5979
02:49:23.071 --> 02:49:23.850
Fuck.

5980
02:49:23.850 --> 02:49:25.440
I look,

5981
02:49:25.710 --> 02:49:28.980
the one thing that I just don't understand is why everyone's panicking about the

5982
02:49:28.981 --> 02:49:29.814
website.

5983
02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:31.350
The website keeps crashing.

5984
02:49:31.351 --> 02:49:32.300
It's not worth whatever it,

5985
02:49:32.301 --> 02:49:33.120
they'll figure it out.

5986
02:49:33.120 --> 02:49:34.830
It'll get the porn guys to figure it out.

5987
02:49:35.100 --> 02:49:36.840
Those guys get 6 billion hits a day.

5988
02:49:37.110 --> 02:49:37.680
They're up.

5989
02:49:37.680 --> 02:49:38.513
That's their problem.

5990
02:49:38.730 --> 02:49:41.210
That's the problem that the Obama administration didn't think about.

5991
02:49:41.220 --> 02:49:43.440
They just hired the wrong people should hire porn people.

5992
02:49:43.680 --> 02:49:46.230
What was the last time you went to a porn website and it crashed because too

5993
02:49:46.231 --> 02:49:46.980
many people were on it.

5994
02:49:46.980 --> 02:49:48.110
That shit never happens.

5995
02:49:48.120 --> 02:49:49.470
I'm not saying that you go to porn websites,

5996
02:49:49.800 --> 02:49:52.170
but I'm saying anybody out there perverts you weirdos.

5997
02:49:52.200 --> 02:49:54.860
If you've ever gone to one and you found out that it's too many people on the

5998
02:49:54.870 --> 02:49:55.703
server crashed,

5999
02:49:55.920 --> 02:49:56.850
that doesn't happen.

6000
02:49:57.030 --> 02:50:00.540
They figured out how to make that work and I guarantee you way more people are

6001
02:50:00.541 --> 02:50:03.630
going to a porn site then are going to any government side,

6002
02:50:04.080 --> 02:50:07.830
whether it's Obamacare or Medicare or whatever,

6003
02:50:07.831 --> 02:50:08.670
name the site.

6004
02:50:08.910 --> 02:50:09.560
So the,

6005
02:50:09.560 --> 02:50:09.990
the,

6006
02:50:09.990 --> 02:50:13.380
the one thing that I will agree on in terms of it being a cluster fuck is only

6007
02:50:13.381 --> 02:50:16.860
50,000 Americans have signed up through the website.

6008
02:50:17.380 --> 02:50:17.820
Um,

6009
02:50:17.820 --> 02:50:21.420
which could be disastrous because in order for the affordable care act to work,

6010
02:50:21.421 --> 02:50:22.440
you need people to sign up.

6011
02:50:22.770 --> 02:50:25.200
I have doubled down on my Instagram page pitch.

6012
02:50:26.700 --> 02:50:28.050
Do you that's amazing.

6013
02:50:28.070 --> 02:50:28.300
No,

6014
02:50:28.300 --> 02:50:29.101
it's not that much.

6015
02:50:29.101 --> 02:50:33.000
There's people with millions by more than a million on Twitter.

6016
02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.100
That's the most places I have a Twitter.

6017
02:50:35.101 --> 02:50:37.890
I think I have a ton of followers on Twitter.

6018
02:50:37.900 --> 02:50:42.170
1,175,682 bananas a lot.

6019
02:50:42.220 --> 02:50:45.030
I think I have like 40 but I'm sure a lot of them are fake.

6020
02:50:45.031 --> 02:50:46.680
I have never paid for any that are fake,

6021
02:50:46.860 --> 02:50:50.290
but there's a lot of bots out there and a lot of people that use a,

6022
02:50:50.360 --> 02:50:52.500
they use fake Twitter accounts,

6023
02:50:53.420 --> 02:50:54.300
slate things.

6024
02:50:54.510 --> 02:50:55.350
I don't want to do that.

6025
02:50:55.380 --> 02:50:58.530
I don't want to like pretend as if I'm like a big superstar or something.

6026
02:50:58.590 --> 02:50:59.970
There's a lot of people that have done it though.

6027
02:51:00.220 --> 02:51:01.080
It's pretty common.

6028
02:51:01.110 --> 02:51:01.501
Apparently.

6029
02:51:01.501 --> 02:51:02.430
It's pretty easy to do.

6030
02:51:02.460 --> 02:51:06.120
You just pay some money and they get you x amount of fake followers for,

6031
02:51:06.121 --> 02:51:11.121
I think for some people it gives them some sort of a confirmation that they're

6032
02:51:11.161 --> 02:51:14.070
okay and they said he's got 25,000 Twitter followers.

6033
02:51:14.071 --> 02:51:14.904
He must be legit.

6034
02:51:15.330 --> 02:51:15.721
Yeah,

6035
02:51:15.721 --> 02:51:16.500
that's true.

6036
02:51:16.500 --> 02:51:16.890
Yeah.

6037
02:51:16.890 --> 02:51:18.090
It's so funny because,

6038
02:51:18.091 --> 02:51:18.550
um,

6039
02:51:18.550 --> 02:51:18.840
you know,

6040
02:51:18.840 --> 02:51:20.490
going back to the class that I'm teaching,

6041
02:51:20.700 --> 02:51:22.440
one of my students looked me up and she's like,

6042
02:51:22.441 --> 02:51:23.310
Holy Shit,

6043
02:51:23.550 --> 02:51:25.620
you have all these followers and you're verified.

6044
02:51:25.830 --> 02:51:26.250
I'm like,

6045
02:51:26.250 --> 02:51:26.490
Oh,

6046
02:51:26.490 --> 02:51:28.290
does that make me more legitimate now?

6047
02:51:28.291 --> 02:51:30.390
Because I have like a verified Twitter account,

6048
02:51:30.600 --> 02:51:31.950
but people think it's a big deal.

6049
02:51:31.951 --> 02:51:32.784
It's really funny.

6050
02:51:32.890 --> 02:51:33.210
Yeah,

6051
02:51:33.210 --> 02:51:34.043
it's big.

6052
02:51:34.120 --> 02:51:34.953
It's big.

6053
02:51:35.490 --> 02:51:36.211
If someone says,

6054
02:51:36.211 --> 02:51:36.601
hey man,

6055
02:51:36.601 --> 02:51:37.530
I want to come with your podcast,

6056
02:51:37.531 --> 02:51:40.410
and I go to their page and they have 212 Twitter followers,

6057
02:51:40.411 --> 02:51:40.740
I'm like,

6058
02:51:40.740 --> 02:51:41.573
bitch,

6059
02:51:42.510 --> 02:51:43.343
you,

6060
02:51:44.520 --> 02:51:45.780
you looked at my Twitter page.

6061
02:51:46.390 --> 02:51:48.480
I got to senior show as soon as you are legit.

6062
02:51:48.540 --> 02:51:48.851
Okay,

6063
02:51:48.851 --> 02:51:49.111
good.

6064
02:51:49.111 --> 02:51:49.471
I didn't,

6065
02:51:49.471 --> 02:51:49.740
uh,

6066
02:51:49.740 --> 02:51:50.820
didn't go to your Twitter page,

6067
02:51:50.821 --> 02:51:51.690
but we can go there right now.

6068
02:51:51.691 --> 02:51:52.330
What do you got?

6069
02:51:52.330 --> 02:51:52.890
How much you got?

6070
02:51:52.890 --> 02:51:53.723
Let me check this out.

6071
02:51:53.790 --> 02:51:55.980
I think 42,000 is that a lot?

6072
02:51:56.310 --> 02:51:57.001
I don't think so.

6073
02:51:57.001 --> 02:51:58.080
I think that's decent.

6074
02:51:58.110 --> 02:51:59.730
How long you've been on the young Turks?

6075
02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:00.721
Oh Gosh.

6076
02:52:00.721 --> 02:52:01.740
For seven years.

6077
02:52:01.800 --> 02:52:02.041
Yeah.

6078
02:52:02.041 --> 02:52:02.700
That's not enough.

6079
02:52:02.700 --> 02:52:03.870
You need more Twitter followers,

6080
02:52:04.020 --> 02:52:06.050
which I'm stronger last.

6081
02:52:07.330 --> 02:52:07.571
Yeah,

6082
02:52:07.571 --> 02:52:08.240
for sure.

6083
02:52:08.240 --> 02:52:09.470
Did I take the titty pictures of you?

6084
02:52:09.471 --> 02:52:09.670
Oh,

6085
02:52:09.670 --> 02:52:10.880
you don't have to go to a titty.

6086
02:52:11.470 --> 02:52:13.870
Take some pictures with like you,

6087
02:52:13.930 --> 02:52:14.500
uh,

6088
02:52:14.500 --> 02:52:15.700
like in a bikini,

6089
02:52:15.701 --> 02:52:17.080
like looking over your shoulder,

6090
02:52:17.370 --> 02:52:17.680
you know,

6091
02:52:17.680 --> 02:52:18.250
at your Bot.

6092
02:52:18.250 --> 02:52:19.083
Those are huge.

6093
02:52:19.160 --> 02:52:20.850
Just one of those probably get you,

6094
02:52:21.070 --> 02:52:21.281
you know,

6095
02:52:21.281 --> 02:52:22.001
you don't want to do that.

6096
02:52:22.001 --> 02:52:24.430
Obviously people out there was screaming at me right now.

6097
02:52:24.460 --> 02:52:26.050
This is why we need feminism.

6098
02:52:26.960 --> 02:52:28.510
<v 2>That's how I was like you</v>

6099
02:52:29.210 --> 02:52:31.160
<v 4>do you get shit for saying that you a,</v>

6100
02:52:31.180 --> 02:52:32.670
you don't like radical feminism.

6101
02:52:32.671 --> 02:52:34.350
Do you ever get people angry at you for,

6102
02:52:34.470 --> 02:52:34.920
<v 2>no.</v>

6103
02:52:34.920 --> 02:52:38.400
The funny thing is a lot of people think that I am a radical feminist,

6104
02:52:38.401 --> 02:52:39.234
which I'm not.

6105
02:52:39.310 --> 02:52:40.710
Any girl that's smart is a feminist,

6106
02:52:40.711 --> 02:52:41.640
instantly did skin.

6107
02:52:41.850 --> 02:52:42.601
It's really funny.

6108
02:52:42.601 --> 02:52:42.901
I'm,

6109
02:52:42.901 --> 02:52:43.740
I'm actually,

6110
02:52:43.770 --> 02:52:48.720
I think the word feminism is tainted at this point and I would much rather refer

6111
02:52:48.721 --> 02:52:52.950
to myself as a gender equality specialists,

6112
02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:53.833
specialists,

6113
02:52:54.880 --> 02:52:55.590
whatever.

6114
02:52:55.590 --> 02:52:55.801
I mean,

6115
02:52:55.801 --> 02:52:56.730
whatever you want to call it,

6116
02:52:56.731 --> 02:52:57.564
because look,

6117
02:52:57.930 --> 02:53:00.780
men get the short end of the stick when it comes to some serious issues.

6118
02:53:00.781 --> 02:53:03.090
Women get the short end of the stick when it comes to serious issues.

6119
02:53:03.390 --> 02:53:06.780
I don't like the brand of feminism that tells me that I can't be feminine.

6120
02:53:07.230 --> 02:53:08.250
I fucking hate that.

6121
02:53:08.340 --> 02:53:12.590
Like I want to wear my dresses and I want to feel sexy and beautiful and I want

6122
02:53:12.591 --> 02:53:13.770
to push for equality.

6123
02:53:13.771 --> 02:53:14.551
You can do that.

6124
02:53:14.551 --> 02:53:16.260
Those things are not mutually exclusive,

6125
02:53:16.650 --> 02:53:18.300
so that's just an example.

6126
02:53:18.510 --> 02:53:19.740
If you look like Fred Flintstone,

6127
02:53:19.741 --> 02:53:20.760
you don't like wearing makeup,

6128
02:53:22.260 --> 02:53:23.810
they probably will be exclusive.

6129
02:53:23.920 --> 02:53:24.160
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

6130
02:53:24.160 --> 02:53:24.381
well it's,

6131
02:53:24.381 --> 02:53:28.040
I think it's one of those things where there's certain people that don't want

6132
02:53:28.041 --> 02:53:29.930
other people behaving differently than them,

6133
02:53:30.170 --> 02:53:33.110
especially if they feel like they're being judged by the fact that you're

6134
02:53:33.111 --> 02:53:36.020
wearing makeup and you have heels on and they don't like that.

6135
02:53:36.110 --> 02:53:37.070
Then they get judged.

6136
02:53:37.071 --> 02:53:37.191
Well.

6137
02:53:37.191 --> 02:53:39.710
Then they start turning that at against you.

6138
02:53:39.920 --> 02:53:40.581
Instead of saying,

6139
02:53:40.581 --> 02:53:40.851
look,

6140
02:53:40.851 --> 02:53:41.091
hey,

6141
02:53:41.091 --> 02:53:42.560
it's different strokes for different folks.

6142
02:53:43.130 --> 02:53:43.970
Some people like this,

6143
02:53:43.971 --> 02:53:44.721
some people like that.

6144
02:53:44.721 --> 02:53:45.554
Instead of that,

6145
02:53:45.560 --> 02:53:48.020
they look to you like you're some sort of a trader.

6146
02:53:48.200 --> 02:53:49.010
Meanwhile,

6147
02:53:49.010 --> 02:53:49.910
those same people,

6148
02:53:49.911 --> 02:53:53.480
if it was a man that was wearing makeup and wearing a dress wearing high heels,

6149
02:53:53.630 --> 02:53:54.081
they would go,

6150
02:53:54.081 --> 02:53:55.100
you go girl,

6151
02:53:55.780 --> 02:53:56.400
they would,

6152
02:53:56.400 --> 02:53:57.590
there would be happy for you.

6153
02:53:57.680 --> 02:53:59.090
Cause that's the progressive move.

6154
02:53:59.240 --> 02:54:02.810
If it's a transgender person that a man who became a woman and wants to wear

6155
02:54:02.811 --> 02:54:06.530
long nails and wants to like be really dainty and feminine,

6156
02:54:06.680 --> 02:54:08.060
that's all well and groovy.

6157
02:54:08.270 --> 02:54:08.511
Yeah.

6158
02:54:08.511 --> 02:54:10.100
But when a woman is dainty and feminine,

6159
02:54:10.101 --> 02:54:10.990
exactly.

6160
02:54:11.080 --> 02:54:11.281
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

6161
02:54:11.281 --> 02:54:12.220
it'd be hilarious.

6162
02:54:12.250 --> 02:54:13.840
The argument that they'll make is,

6163
02:54:13.841 --> 02:54:15.940
well if you don't want to be objectified,

6164
02:54:15.941 --> 02:54:17.350
then don't objectify yourself.

6165
02:54:18.740 --> 02:54:20.110
I don't find it objectifying.

6166
02:54:20.111 --> 02:54:24.220
Just because I'm wearing something that's considered sexy doesn't mean that I'm

6167
02:54:24.490 --> 02:54:26.080
asking people to objectify me in.

6168
02:54:26.081 --> 02:54:27.070
If people do,

6169
02:54:27.340 --> 02:54:28.630
then that's on them.

6170
02:54:28.631 --> 02:54:29.111
Like it's,

6171
02:54:29.111 --> 02:54:30.310
it's kind of like saying,

6172
02:54:30.520 --> 02:54:30.791
you know,

6173
02:54:30.791 --> 02:54:32.530
if a woman dresses sexy,

6174
02:54:32.650 --> 02:54:34.430
then she deserves to get raped.

6175
02:54:34.431 --> 02:54:35.800
She should expect to get raped,

6176
02:54:35.801 --> 02:54:36.310
right?

6177
02:54:36.310 --> 02:54:37.000
No.

6178
02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:38.590
Like a woman who dresses sexy,

6179
02:54:38.591 --> 02:54:41.200
you shouldn't expect someone to do anything.

6180
02:54:41.290 --> 02:54:43.660
<v 4>I don't think you should expect to get objectified ever.</v>

6181
02:54:43.900 --> 02:54:44.660
And what is the,

6182
02:54:44.660 --> 02:54:46.440
what does objectify even mean that someone,

6183
02:54:47.020 --> 02:54:48.850
if someone is attracted to you physically,

6184
02:54:48.851 --> 02:54:51.310
are they objectifying you if they want to look at you while they have sex with

6185
02:54:51.311 --> 02:54:52.390
you or they objectifying you?

6186
02:54:52.391 --> 02:54:52.990
Like what?

6187
02:54:52.990 --> 02:54:54.070
When they find you sexy,

6188
02:54:54.071 --> 02:54:54.820
at what point?

6189
02:54:54.820 --> 02:54:55.151
What did,

6190
02:54:55.151 --> 02:54:56.140
where's the gradient?

6191
02:54:56.141 --> 02:54:57.310
Like what's the spectrum?

6192
02:54:57.360 --> 02:54:57.550
Right.

6193
02:54:57.550 --> 02:55:01.330
Where it falls into objectification of women if you're not profiting off of her.

6194
02:55:01.331 --> 02:55:03.440
Are you objecting w objectifying?

6195
02:55:03.441 --> 02:55:04.274
Like what?

6196
02:55:04.330 --> 02:55:04.760
What,

6197
02:55:04.760 --> 02:55:05.780
where's the gray area?

6198
02:55:05.781 --> 02:55:06.860
It's a kind of a strange thing.

6199
02:55:06.861 --> 02:55:10.940
If someone likes the way you look in a dress or they objectifying you,

6200
02:55:11.180 --> 02:55:13.250
it's like how was that objectifying?

6201
02:55:13.251 --> 02:55:13.411
It's,

6202
02:55:13.411 --> 02:55:16.430
it's a just a fashion sense or it's just an aesthetic.

6203
02:55:16.431 --> 02:55:16.750
It's,

6204
02:55:16.750 --> 02:55:17.330
and it's,

6205
02:55:17.330 --> 02:55:21.020
it's stupid to pretend as if women don't objectify men as well.

6206
02:55:21.050 --> 02:55:24.380
I did it the other day when I went on a hike and it was like a ton of hot guys

6207
02:55:24.381 --> 02:55:26.630
without their shirts on people.

6208
02:55:26.750 --> 02:55:28.880
It's human nature to objectify.

6209
02:55:29.330 --> 02:55:30.710
I don't like that word.

6210
02:55:30.770 --> 02:55:32.690
I think it's you're admiring,

6211
02:55:33.140 --> 02:55:34.130
you're attracted to it.

6212
02:55:34.131 --> 02:55:35.450
So what does objectify,

6213
02:55:35.451 --> 02:55:38.090
you want to turn them into an object that means dehumanizing them.

6214
02:55:38.160 --> 02:55:40.910
It means removing the humanity and use them as a fuck toy.

6215
02:55:41.120 --> 02:55:42.850
But that's not what you're looking to do.

6216
02:55:42.851 --> 02:55:44.240
That that's not what you're looking to do.

6217
02:55:44.270 --> 02:55:47.570
You are physically attracted to someone and that's the first thing that stands

6218
02:55:47.571 --> 02:55:48.404
out to you.

6219
02:55:48.500 --> 02:55:52.310
I think that it becomes wrong when that's all you see in the person,

6220
02:55:52.550 --> 02:55:52.911
right.

6221
02:55:52.911 --> 02:55:57.830
When that's all that matters to you and you know someone's level of intellect or

6222
02:55:57.860 --> 02:55:59.870
character means nothing.

6223
02:55:59.871 --> 02:56:00.350
You know what?

6224
02:56:00.350 --> 02:56:01.700
I don't even think that's wrong.

6225
02:56:02.500 --> 02:56:02.870
No.

6226
02:56:02.870 --> 02:56:05.750
I think if you're nice to each other and you're just like dating people that are

6227
02:56:05.751 --> 02:56:06.584
really pretty,

6228
02:56:06.680 --> 02:56:07.910
who gives a shit?

6229
02:56:08.220 --> 02:56:10.850
What am I supposed to be upset at you if you have dumb friends?

6230
02:56:11.090 --> 02:56:11.391
No,

6231
02:56:11.391 --> 02:56:12.710
but when you fuck dumb people,

6232
02:56:12.711 --> 02:56:13.970
I'm supposed to get a mad.

6233
02:56:14.090 --> 02:56:15.020
Can't you do better?

6234
02:56:15.140 --> 02:56:16.280
Maybe it doesn't want to do better.

6235
02:56:16.490 --> 02:56:18.050
Maybe he likes being around dumb friends,

6236
02:56:18.170 --> 02:56:21.620
maybe likes having a dumb girlfriend or a dumb boyfriend who do I give a shit?

6237
02:56:21.860 --> 02:56:22.730
I don't care what Pete,

6238
02:56:22.790 --> 02:56:23.840
what other people do.

6239
02:56:23.900 --> 02:56:25.820
I don't want to be looked upon that way.

6240
02:56:25.821 --> 02:56:27.710
Like I don't want people to look at me and say like,

6241
02:56:27.740 --> 02:56:27.921
oh,

6242
02:56:27.921 --> 02:56:30.920
she's just a pretty face and nothing more than that one's going to do that

6243
02:56:30.921 --> 02:56:32.420
unless they're trying to define you.

6244
02:56:32.421 --> 02:56:32.691
I mean,

6245
02:56:32.691 --> 02:56:33.471
you know better than that.

6246
02:56:33.471 --> 02:56:34.240
How dare you?

6247
02:56:34.240 --> 02:56:35.270
I dare you play that game.

6248
02:56:37.160 --> 02:56:38.060
That's not gonna fly.

6249
02:56:38.510 --> 02:56:38.960
Yeah.

6250
02:56:38.960 --> 02:56:40.860
I think there's also an issue where,

6251
02:56:40.861 --> 02:56:41.450
um,

6252
02:56:41.450 --> 02:56:42.210
people,

6253
02:56:42.210 --> 02:56:42.610
they,

6254
02:56:42.610 --> 02:56:46.190
they feel uncomfortable if they're not there.

6255
02:56:46.191 --> 02:56:47.900
They're not seen as attractive.

6256
02:56:48.080 --> 02:56:52.640
And so they tried to squash other things that people think are attractive.

6257
02:56:52.790 --> 02:56:53.571
They tried to,

6258
02:56:53.571 --> 02:56:53.900
like,

6259
02:56:53.900 --> 02:56:58.010
they just try to be little attempts at being attractive.

6260
02:56:58.160 --> 02:56:58.371
I mean,

6261
02:56:58.371 --> 02:57:00.290
I think that there's an issue in that as well.

6262
02:57:00.410 --> 02:57:01.790
If there wasn't an issue in that.

6263
02:57:02.020 --> 02:57:05.960
And if you are a type of person that likes wearing chuck Taylors and loose jeans

6264
02:57:05.961 --> 02:57:06.740
and t shirts,

6265
02:57:06.740 --> 02:57:09.510
what do you care if a woman is wearing a bikini right?

6266
02:57:09.640 --> 02:57:09.921
Beach,

6267
02:57:09.921 --> 02:57:11.530
what do you care if someone wears a mini skirt?

6268
02:57:11.531 --> 02:57:12.920
Like w how does that affect you?

6269
02:57:13.220 --> 02:57:14.120
It doesn't affect you,

6270
02:57:14.121 --> 02:57:14.540
I think,

6271
02:57:14.540 --> 02:57:14.901
you know,

6272
02:57:14.901 --> 02:57:15.740
competition,

6273
02:57:15.741 --> 02:57:16.341
jealousy,

6274
02:57:16.341 --> 02:57:18.470
all of that kind of plays a role in that as well.

6275
02:57:18.710 --> 02:57:20.150
It exposes Douche bags.

6276
02:57:20.180 --> 02:57:21.290
It's excellent that,

6277
02:57:21.350 --> 02:57:21.790
you know,

6278
02:57:21.790 --> 02:57:23.120
exposes asshole men.

6279
02:57:23.150 --> 02:57:23.391
I mean,

6280
02:57:23.391 --> 02:57:23.751
yeah,

6281
02:57:23.751 --> 02:57:25.100
you put yourself in a vulnerable position.

6282
02:57:25.101 --> 02:57:29.150
If you'll walk around like wearing a bikini and you're walking down main street

6283
02:57:29.151 --> 02:57:29.371
and you know,

6284
02:57:29.371 --> 02:57:30.440
fucking high heels on,

6285
02:57:30.750 --> 02:57:32.330
you're going to run into a lot of weird people.

6286
02:57:32.570 --> 02:57:35.510
Just kind of given them a green light to get freaky with you or at least going

6287
02:57:35.511 --> 02:57:36.081
to look good.

6288
02:57:36.081 --> 02:57:39.020
You boom you owned were,

6289
02:57:39.800 --> 02:57:40.633
yeah.

6290
02:57:40.990 --> 02:57:41.823
It's weird way to end it.

6291
02:57:41.990 --> 02:57:44.090
I think we'd have to time a three,

6292
02:57:44.091 --> 02:57:44.661
three hours in,

6293
02:57:44.661 --> 02:57:45.560
we turn into a pumpkin.

6294
02:57:45.920 --> 02:57:46.460
Um,

6295
02:57:46.460 --> 02:57:47.211
this was a great show.

6296
02:57:47.211 --> 02:57:48.020
I really enjoyed it.

6297
02:57:48.020 --> 02:57:48.681
I enjoyed it too.

6298
02:57:48.681 --> 02:57:49.440
It was a lot of fun.

6299
02:57:49.440 --> 02:57:50.273
I got to know you.

6300
02:57:50.430 --> 02:57:50.900
Yeah.

6301
02:57:50.900 --> 02:57:51.261
I hope.

6302
02:57:51.261 --> 02:57:52.094
I hope they liked me.

6303
02:57:52.440 --> 02:57:54.010
They liked to you according to Twitter and their peers.

6304
02:57:54.430 --> 02:57:54.891
That's awesome.

6305
02:57:54.891 --> 02:57:56.600
Just one last shout out to Robert.

02:58:39.691 --> 02:58:40.260
earth.

6329
