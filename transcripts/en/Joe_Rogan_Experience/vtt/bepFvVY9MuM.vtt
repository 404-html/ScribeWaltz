1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:01.230
From diana hunting sometimes.

2
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:01.621
Yeah,

3
00:00:01.621 --> 00:00:02.131
man.

4
00:00:02.131 --> 00:00:03.030
Come down.

5
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.440
A lot of wild pigs out here.

6
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.040
Alexandra [inaudible] ladies and gentlemen,

7
00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:08.874
we're live.

8
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:09.780
Good to see you buddy.

9
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.613
What's happening?

10
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:11.131
I'm good.

11
00:00:11.131 --> 00:00:11.820
I'm good.

12
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.340
You are you just recovering from shoulder surgery?

13
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.600
Did you show us what'd you have done?

14
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.191
<v 1>Uh,</v>

15
00:00:17.191 --> 00:00:18.024
I was wrestling,

16
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.310
wrestling practice or I got taken down,

17
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.173
believe it or not,

18
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.230
I should slammed and I landed on,

19
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.590
I was,

20
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.170
I was like trying to post with my mom and I was slammed,

21
00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:30.720
so just felt something in my shoulder basically.

22
00:00:30.721 --> 00:00:35.280
And it didn't hurt it first I was trying to stand up and I felt it was just a

23
00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:36.090
mess in there.

24
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.870
And after that I went through hospital and from there I've been,

25
00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:40.261
I've been,

26
00:00:40.261 --> 00:00:41.094
I've been rehabbing,

27
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.990
I got a plate inside.

28
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.771
Oh Wow.

29
00:00:43.771 --> 00:00:44.280
Plate.

30
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.611
Yeah.

31
00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:46.050
I took it out now in like,

32
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.280
uh,

33
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.113
ended last year,

34
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.250
but I had played for a couple of months.

35
00:00:50.251 --> 00:00:50.970
Yeah.

36
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.530
What was the extent of the injury?

37
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.023
Uh,

38
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.930
nothing was broken.

39
00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:56.310
It was more like the collarbone,

40
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.233
just,

41
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.460
just a dislocated,

42
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.320
they still get ripped apart from my shoulder,

43
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.820
so they had to put it back in.

44
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.260
But to play it on three screws down,

45
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.530
that's the first rule India had for my whole career.

46
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.270
I had Bruce's teachers and all that.

47
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.790
But this is the first real as probably not back,

48
00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:12.260
but

49
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.000
<v 0>pull this thing right in front of your face there.</v>

50
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:14.920
So sorry if I,

51
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.020
this Sunday your viking beard's getting muffled.

52
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.460
So whether their tendons torn or ligaments,

53
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.513
ligaments,

54
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.950
10,

55
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:24.080
oh,

56
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.220
everything just torn apart.

57
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.940
Wow.

58
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.760
So they stitched it all back together again.

59
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:28.700
Put a plate in there.

60
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:29.520
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

61
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.570
And now I've just been,

62
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.291
I've been rehabbing,

63
00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:31.801
I feel fine.

64
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:32.611
I'm 100% now,

65
00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:32.851
so I'll be,

66
00:01:32.851 --> 00:01:33.020
I'm,

67
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.853
I'm training.

68
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.070
So how many months was it?

69
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.960
Wow.

70
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.000
This happened in August and uh,

71
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.973
uh,

72
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.880
took away the plate and the last,

73
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.790
last year and I'd be rehabbing for a couple of months.

74
00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:48.480
So yeah,

75
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.890
I have six months.

76
00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:50.281
Totally.

77
00:01:50.281 --> 00:01:50.640
Maybe.

78
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.473
<v 0>Oh yes.</v>

79
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.370
When you grabbed the bow and you're pulling it back,

80
00:01:53.371 --> 00:01:53.611
I'm like,

81
00:01:53.611 --> 00:01:54.930
maybe I shouldn't have him do that.

82
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.303
That's like,

83
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.500
you know that that kind of movement is like basketball sign.

84
00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.690
No,

85
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:00.111
I'm good.

86
00:02:00.111 --> 00:02:00.710
I'm good.

87
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.680
It's all good.

88
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:02.370
That's good.

89
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.740
The bowl was powerful.

90
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:04.920
I didn't expect though.

91
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.580
Yeah.

92
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.413
It's no joke.

93
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.200
It's good.

94
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.070
That's real shit.

95
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.631
Oh yeah.

96
00:02:08.631 --> 00:02:08.881
Yeah.

97
00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:09.810
It's definitely good.

98
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.220
Like back training,

99
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.650
if you wanted to work on those muscles,

100
00:02:13.651 --> 00:02:14.580
they're very specific.

101
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.390
100%.

102
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.223
Yeah.

103
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.153
But um,

104
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.260
so when you do that,

105
00:02:19.261 --> 00:02:23.550
do you go through how you doing like platelet rich plasma and all sorts of

106
00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:26.220
different therapies to try to accelerate the healing?

107
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.210
<v 1>Well,</v>

108
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.980
I had done,

109
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:29.813
I done,

110
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:30.611
I done my,

111
00:02:30.611 --> 00:02:33.610
I'd done my physical rehab.

112
00:02:33.611 --> 00:02:34.690
I've done a lot of like,

113
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.253
uh,

114
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.480
I don't know the word in English,

115
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.850
but a lot of acupuncture,

116
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.961
acupuncture.

117
00:02:43.961 --> 00:02:44.330
Yeah.

118
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.830
A lot of,

119
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:45.850
a lot of massage,

120
00:02:45.851 --> 00:02:48.100
a lot of rehab and lift in small weights.

121
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.260
Really boring stuff.

122
00:02:50.261 --> 00:02:50.941
I hate that stuff.

123
00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:51.120
I,

124
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.940
I,

125
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:52.780
I had it so much,

126
00:02:52.781 --> 00:02:53.980
but you just have to do it.

127
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.390
It's just tiny weights.

128
00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.470
I started with that and then I'd just been increasing and Nah,

129
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:00.340
that's

130
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.060
<v 2>it.</v>

131
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.980
Welling ass rehabbing you.

132
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.150
I,

133
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.491
you know,

134
00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:07.120
obviously I'm a big fan of yours and I was very worried when,

135
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.973
um,

136
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.090
after the clover to share a fight,

137
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.480
which I thought was like your masterpiece so far in your career.

138
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:14.170
Thank you.

139
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.351
Well,

140
00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:14.950
it's just,

141
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.000
you've always been a very,

142
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:16.900
very good fighter,

143
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:20.050
but when you see a guy hit this new level,

144
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.150
and that's what I felt like you were in the Glover fight.

145
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:22.451
I was like,

146
00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:23.380
Jesus Christ.

147
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.290
I like that combination that you finished him off with was that was some video

148
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:27.124
game shit.

149
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.850
That was crazy.

150
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.610
It was it like for yourself too,

151
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.380
right?

152
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.213
It was just standing there.

153
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.860
It was just standing there and I just,

154
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.600
yeah,

155
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.011
it's my show.

156
00:03:34.011 --> 00:03:34.890
I hate my apricots.

157
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.950
Yeah.

158
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:36.783
I worked all night.

159
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.103
It was crazy.

160
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.690
Um,

161
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.620
but so then when I heard that you were injured after that,

162
00:03:40.621 --> 00:03:40.960
I'm like,

163
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.650
ah,

164
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.483
Shit.

165
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.740
Like you were just catching your stride.

166
00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:45.270
It was just,

167
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.210
so that's what I felt because I felt like I had,

168
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.670
I had,

169
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.310
everything's go,

170
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.810
I had such a flow in,

171
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:52.571
in training,

172
00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:53.120
in,

173
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.370
in life generally.

174
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.090
Everything felt really good and I'm hungry.

175
00:03:58.091 --> 00:03:58.231
I'll,

176
00:03:58.231 --> 00:03:59.021
I was motivated.

177
00:03:59.021 --> 00:04:00.340
I'm very motivated.

178
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.970
Uh,

179
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:01.840
but that,

180
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.930
that time after that,

181
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.950
that win and Glover is a tough opponent and everything went so well with the

182
00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:09.190
fight and everything.

183
00:04:09.191 --> 00:04:09.501
And,

184
00:04:09.501 --> 00:04:09.960
and,

185
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.793
uh,

186
00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.700
I felt really good.

187
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.960
And then this happened.

188
00:04:13.961 --> 00:04:14.350
So,

189
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.031
so it was,

190
00:04:15.031 --> 00:04:16.160
it was a big setback.

191
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.581
But,

192
00:04:16.581 --> 00:04:17.414
uh,

193
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.180
what else in kill you makes you stronger,

194
00:04:19.181 --> 00:04:19.360
right?

195
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.100
So I just kept working on it then,

196
00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:21.521
and,

197
00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:22.354
uh,

198
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.463
I just,

199
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.863
I just like,

200
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:25.271
I'm just,

201
00:04:25.271 --> 00:04:26.530
I just looked forward and,

202
00:04:26.531 --> 00:04:27.570
and uh,

203
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.260
I got a golden my site.

204
00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:29.980
That's it.

205
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:30.221
Well,

206
00:04:30.221 --> 00:04:34.420
the one thing that is good about something like that is it really gives you time

207
00:04:34.421 --> 00:04:38.500
to pause and reflect and pay attention to all the other aspects of your game.

208
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.470
And you're such a foot work heavy movement,

209
00:04:41.471 --> 00:04:42.950
heavy guy as my thing.

210
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.223
Yeah.

211
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.070
Well that's Sara.

212
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.070
It's so unusual for a guy as tall and as big as you to be so agile and have so

213
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:51.550
much footwork and movement.

214
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.911
I mean,

215
00:04:51.911 --> 00:04:56.020
it must be a giant asset for you and fighting it is and feel for the Glover

216
00:04:56.021 --> 00:04:56.650
fight.

217
00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.970
I could do that for 10 rounds.

218
00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.010
Uh,

219
00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.231
you know,

220
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:00.220
I wasn't tired at all.

221
00:05:00.221 --> 00:05:01.054
I would just,

222
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.670
I did my thing and I was out of there.

223
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:04.720
I wasn't in his pocket.

224
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:05.001
I listened.

225
00:05:05.001 --> 00:05:06.360
He needs to arrange right now.

226
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.810
I did my thing again and I was out of there.

227
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.710
I could do that all night,

228
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.960
all night long and that,

229
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.930
that's also a thing like you always had it,

230
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.250
but after I fight,

231
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.300
I really felt that this,

232
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.650
this is working,

233
00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:20.260
this is my thing and this is what I'm going to use and I'm going to get better

234
00:05:20.261 --> 00:05:20.470
at it.

235
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.400
I'm going to get better than everything,

236
00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:21.851
the whole game.

237
00:05:21.851 --> 00:05:22.810
But this is my,

238
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.520
this is my key thing.

239
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:25.300
This is it.

240
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.610
And I know movement and footwork.

241
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.630
If I fought DC,

242
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:29.523
like I fought,

243
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:30.850
I fought Glover,

244
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.740
I'll beat him.

245
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:33.580
I'll be in all day long.

246
00:05:33.581 --> 00:05:34.414
I'm telling you I'll beat him.

247
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.501
Well,

248
00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:37.450
it was a very close fight the first time you guys find that,

249
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.790
but I still didn't,

250
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.470
I didn't do it enough,

251
00:05:41.471 --> 00:05:41.720
man.

252
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.100
I was,

253
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.240
I was in his pocket too much.

254
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.580
One of the things that I really like about you,

255
00:05:45.581 --> 00:05:46.150
Alex,

256
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.120
is that when you talk about yourself,

257
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.860
you're very hard on yourself.

258
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.491
You know,

259
00:05:51.491 --> 00:05:54.250
like I'd like that one of the things that you said,

260
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.460
Z,

261
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.600
you're never satisfied.

262
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.350
This is the life of a high level athlete.

263
00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.280
Never satisfied.

264
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:59.330
Never.

265
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.163
Never.

266
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:00.981
I just,

267
00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:04.550
I just wanted to improve all the time and I always been the guy always been that

268
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.540
that person always had to take the hard way in stuff.

269
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.380
Learning,

270
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.480
learning new stuff all the time,

271
00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:12.050
take the new,

272
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.231
uh,

273
00:06:12.231 --> 00:06:12.920
the hard way.

274
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.753
You know?

275
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.510
I always had to take a beating with first before I win that that's,

276
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:18.631
that's how it's been.

277
00:06:18.631 --> 00:06:18.801
And,

278
00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:19.401
and uh,

279
00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:20.570
and that just makes me stronger.

280
00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:23.680
And I got the firing menu scrolls.

281
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.591
Yeah.

282
00:06:24.591 --> 00:06:25.820
Well you're still young.

283
00:06:25.821 --> 00:06:25.971
I mean,

284
00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:26.660
how old are you now?

285
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:27.870
31 not that young.

286
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.120
That's young though.

287
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.700
I mean we think consider how long you've been fighting in the UFC.

288
00:06:31.701 --> 00:06:31.971
I mean,

289
00:06:31.971 --> 00:06:36.110
how old were you when you had your first fight in UFC 2120 does crazy.

290
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.830
10 years now.

291
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:37.730
That's crazy.

292
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:38.583
She's 10 years.

293
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.970
Do you think about yourself as 21 fighting in the UFC?

294
00:06:40.971 --> 00:06:43.760
Like what it feels like?

295
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.740
But I think it's 10 years.

296
00:06:45.741 --> 00:06:46.101
10 years.

297
00:06:46.101 --> 00:06:46.881
She's always 10 years.

298
00:06:46.881 --> 00:06:48.080
But it feels like it was yesterday.

299
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.040
I'm sure Tom runs in dispatch.

300
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.831
I'm thinking in this business,

301
00:06:50.831 --> 00:06:51.710
because your life is,

302
00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:53.480
it's all about the next fight.

303
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.070
It's always planning for the next flight,

304
00:06:55.071 --> 00:06:55.641
the next flight.

305
00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:56.810
So Jason,

306
00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.250
we're just passing me by.

307
00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:58.561
Well,

308
00:06:58.561 --> 00:07:02.060
you also have constant growth and improvement,

309
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:07.090
but it gets tested in these big jumps like every three times a year,

310
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:08.270
two times a year,

311
00:07:08.271 --> 00:07:08.691
whatever it is.

312
00:07:08.691 --> 00:07:09.770
Your schedule that you're fighting on.

313
00:07:09.771 --> 00:07:10.100
Yeah.

314
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:15.100
You get these big tests and you get to find out how applicable everything that

315
00:07:15.381 --> 00:07:16.400
you've worked on is.

316
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:17.540
Yeah,

317
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:18.373
yeah.

318
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.600
That's,

319
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.301
that's how it is.

320
00:07:20.301 --> 00:07:20.431
And,

321
00:07:20.431 --> 00:07:20.691
and,

322
00:07:20.691 --> 00:07:20.991
and you,

323
00:07:20.991 --> 00:07:21.421
you feel,

324
00:07:21.421 --> 00:07:22.980
you feel off that test.

325
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.833
You just fill out,

326
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.113
<v 3>okay,</v>

327
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:26.680
<v 2>what's next?</v>

328
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.200
Yeah.

329
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.220
What should I do next?

330
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:28.450
What?

331
00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:28.941
What's the,

332
00:07:28.941 --> 00:07:29.870
what's the nest improvement?

333
00:07:29.871 --> 00:07:30.704
What's the best,

334
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:31.940
what's the nest opponent?

335
00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:32.810
Uh,

336
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:33.643
where's the belt?

337
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:34.220
Well,

338
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.053
stuff like that,

339
00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:36.080
you know,

340
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.880
when you get off of like,

341
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.970
you had like one of the most spectacular fights with Jon Jones.

342
00:07:40.971 --> 00:07:41.211
I mean,

343
00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:42.060
down to the wire,

344
00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:43.790
like is as close as it gets.

345
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.700
And when you get out of a fight like that,

346
00:07:46.701 --> 00:07:50.090
will you all most won the title against the greatest of all time?

347
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:51.260
Like what is,

348
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.840
what is that feeling like and where do you go from there?

349
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.983
Uh,

350
00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:57.780
Oh,

351
00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:58.613
you know,

352
00:07:58.830 --> 00:07:59.490
it was tough.

353
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:03.470
It was really tough because I know everybody was saying,

354
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.370
are you winning this fight?

355
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.213
Winning this fight?

356
00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:07.020
You had three rounds against him.

357
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.040
Now you winning this fight,

358
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:08.610
the lie,

359
00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:09.750
if it felt like,

360
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:11.431
like you said,

361
00:08:11.431 --> 00:08:11.910
it was something,

362
00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:12.743
it was just,

363
00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.330
it was just right there at the goal line.

364
00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:15.991
You know,

365
00:08:15.991 --> 00:08:18.360
I didn't really pass that goal nine at all.

366
00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:19.110
Um,

367
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:22.890
I just felt like that it was tough.

368
00:08:22.891 --> 00:08:23.724
It was tough,

369
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:24.280
but by,

370
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.120
but like now I'm sitting here now talking to you.

371
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:28.200
It's a big,

372
00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.470
it's a really good experience for me and in our really,

373
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.480
it's a good time for me.

374
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:36.480
If I was a,W is a highlight in my career for sure in my life,

375
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:37.140
for sure.

376
00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.820
It was such a close fight when the,

377
00:08:38.821 --> 00:08:41.880
when the scorecards are being tagged and you,

378
00:08:41.881 --> 00:08:42.510
uh,

379
00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:43.380
you know,

380
00:08:43.381 --> 00:08:44.910
you're just sitting there waiting for the decision.

381
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:45.830
Did you think you hadn't,

382
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:47.510
you know,

383
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:48.270
I didn't know.

384
00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:48.570
Right.

385
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:49.230
I didn't know.

386
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:50.430
I did know much chaos.

387
00:08:50.431 --> 00:08:53.040
Could you even remember what had happened over the last five rounds?

388
00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:54.361
I remember,

389
00:08:54.361 --> 00:08:55.090
I remember,

390
00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:55.830
I remember the,

391
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:56.760
I remember the fight,

392
00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:58.230
uh,

393
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.600
and I got a,

394
00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.190
I remember almost the whole fight,

395
00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:05.070
but it was just John Jones just such a basis.

396
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:06.503
He,

397
00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:07.363
you know,

398
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:08.483
I'm telling you,

399
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:09.241
just for me,

400
00:09:09.241 --> 00:09:09.481
John,

401
00:09:09.481 --> 00:09:12.750
John's winning over John Jones is bigger than taking the belt.

402
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.250
I'm telling you that guys,

403
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:16.890
the guy is such a beast and,

404
00:09:16.891 --> 00:09:17.724
and uh,

405
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:19.740
yeah.

406
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:20.573
What was the question?

407
00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:21.700
No,

408
00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.430
it's okay to express yourself.

409
00:09:23.431 --> 00:09:24.240
That's fine.

410
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:24.571
I mean,

411
00:09:24.571 --> 00:09:25.410
I agree with you.

412
00:09:25.411 --> 00:09:26.161
He is a beast.

413
00:09:26.161 --> 00:09:26.401
You know,

414
00:09:26.401 --> 00:09:26.481
I'm,

415
00:09:26.481 --> 00:09:29.220
I'm very disappointed with all the stuff that's happened to him obviously,

416
00:09:29.221 --> 00:09:30.810
and especially the most recent one,

417
00:09:30.811 --> 00:09:31.644
which I really,

418
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.680
I really believe based on the evidence as a mistake,

419
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:35.640
I think,

420
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.100
I think he got ahold of something tainted because of they,

421
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.620
they tested him before that he was negative.

422
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.680
They tested them after that he was negative and what he tested for,

423
00:09:43.681 --> 00:09:45.030
with such a minuscule amount,

424
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.380
there's no way.

425
00:09:46.381 --> 00:09:47.050
It was something that,

426
00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:47.490
yeah,

427
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:48.323
there's no way,

428
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:52.500
like according to Novitsky and according to Usada according to like how they

429
00:09:52.501 --> 00:09:53.334
test people,

430
00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:53.900
what,

431
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:58.320
whatever he consumed must have been an extremely small amount.

432
00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:02.580
It wasn't an amount that would have had any benefit whatsoever in terms of

433
00:10:02.581 --> 00:10:03.300
performance,

434
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.380
performance enhancing.

435
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:05.861
Well they know their thing.

436
00:10:05.861 --> 00:10:06.970
So you know,

437
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.920
just let the experts handle that.

438
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:11.850
I don't know what to say.

439
00:10:11.851 --> 00:10:16.650
I know for a fact that he's been in that same situation a couple of times.

440
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.700
This is not the first time.

441
00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:18.280
So,

442
00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:18.650
you know,

443
00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:20.060
it's just,

444
00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:22.200
he definitely is a wild motherfucker.

445
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:24.860
Hayes Hayes is,

446
00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:26.191
it definitely does.

447
00:10:26.191 --> 00:10:28.800
Some shitty probably shouldn't do but 100% man.

448
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:29.813
But uh,

449
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:30.270
I mean,

450
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:31.200
but the thing is,

451
00:10:31.201 --> 00:10:32.880
it's so stupid because he's,

452
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:33.870
what is he?

453
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:36.150
He's the best guy pound for pound

454
00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:38.400
out there.

455
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.970
He's done things nobody else has done is he,

456
00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:46.140
he's just a beast and still shit just comes up all the time.

457
00:10:46.261 --> 00:10:48.050
He doesn't even need that steroids.

458
00:10:48.051 --> 00:10:49.560
So it doesn't even need that shit in him.

459
00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:51.660
He's still the best out there.

460
00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:52.950
I don't think he took anything.

461
00:10:52.951 --> 00:10:53.521
I really don't.

462
00:10:53.521 --> 00:10:53.830
But I,

463
00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:58.020
but I agree with you on that and I think you need a guy like that.

464
00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:00.240
You need a guy like that out there,

465
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.420
like to bring you to your full potential.

466
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:04.020
Do you agree?

467
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:04.171
Yeah,

468
00:11:04.171 --> 00:11:04.860
I agree with you.

469
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:05.620
I agree with you.

470
00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:06.300
Yeah.

471
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.133
Like I said to you,

472
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:09.060
fighting him and beating him,

473
00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:10.770
that's bigger than taking the bumps right now.

474
00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:11.963
That's how I feel.

475
00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:12.990
Because he's,

476
00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.400
look what it did to DC,

477
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:14.700
man.

478
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.110
Yeah.

479
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:17.820
This is tough history that he finished DC.

480
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:18.450
Yes.

481
00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:19.290
That's just insane.

482
00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.490
It's just insane.

483
00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.150
And he finished him with a kick that DC said he's never going to hit him with

484
00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:25.913
crazy.

485
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.820
That's insane.

486
00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:26.960
Yeah.

487
00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.320
It's like you're never going to hit me with that left thigh kick lamb.

488
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:30.990
Yeah.

489
00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:33.230
Just look for the opportunity to takes it.

490
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:33.811
Yeah.

491
00:11:33.811 --> 00:11:35.190
Tendencies are crazy.

492
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:39.540
It's just some of them just get so ingrained in the way your body moves and you

493
00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:40.460
know,

494
00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:40.710
he's,

495
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:40.960
he,

496
00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:41.590
he's an expert.

497
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:42.450
What of course,

498
00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:43.820
what he's doing and he's,

499
00:11:43.821 --> 00:11:45.690
he's studying his opponent very well.

500
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:47.610
Uh,

501
00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:52.230
everything is still such planet in details for the fights and he just,

502
00:11:52.231 --> 00:11:53.064
he knows exactly.

503
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.730
He should go for that or that or that.

504
00:11:54.731 --> 00:11:57.490
And staying creative and use news fantasy.

505
00:11:57.491 --> 00:11:59.320
And it's amazing to see.

506
00:11:59.470 --> 00:11:59.711
Yeah,

507
00:11:59.711 --> 00:12:02.920
that Jackson John Team is truly exceptional team.

508
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:03.131
I mean,

509
00:12:03.131 --> 00:12:05.050
they really did do phenomenal with him.

510
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:10.270
Now where you're at now is a very interesting situation because John is in

511
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.110
exile.

512
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:13.420
No one knows what's going to happen in terms of how long it's going to be

513
00:12:13.421 --> 00:12:14.254
suspended.

514
00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:18.400
DC is now fighting steep Emile chips for the heavyweight title.

515
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.230
And who knows what's happening there.

516
00:12:20.231 --> 00:12:21.040
I mean that,

517
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.730
does that bother you because it seems like it Kinda like puts the two oh five

518
00:12:24.731 --> 00:12:25.960
title in limbo.

519
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.240
It does.

520
00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:27.640
Yeah,

521
00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:28.473
it does.

522
00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:31.030
I didn't see that coming at all.

523
00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:33.340
This is typified at all.

524
00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:33.971
You know,

525
00:12:33.971 --> 00:12:34.211
it's a,

526
00:12:34.211 --> 00:12:34.451
it's a,

527
00:12:34.451 --> 00:12:35.560
it's a great fight for,

528
00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.240
for them and for the financing,

529
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.133
for the spoiled,

530
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:38.621
you know,

531
00:12:38.621 --> 00:12:39.520
for us standing,

532
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:40.510
standing in line,

533
00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:41.710
we just,

534
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:42.311
you know,

535
00:12:42.311 --> 00:12:43.330
we're just sitting there on our,

536
00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:44.963
on our,

537
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.950
we just sitting there and waiting for him for an opportunity and it's not going

538
00:12:47.951 --> 00:12:48.281
to come.

539
00:12:48.281 --> 00:12:49.091
It's not going to be there.

540
00:12:49.091 --> 00:12:49.900
So,

541
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:50.361
and all and,

542
00:12:50.361 --> 00:12:50.601
and,

543
00:12:50.601 --> 00:12:51.434
and uh,

544
00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:53.853
you know,

545
00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:54.100
I,

546
00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:57.340
I wa that that's also a thing that had been motivated me a lot because

547
00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.070
often if I were glove,

548
00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:00.800
I got engine and,

549
00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.430
and all that and I was really looking forward to come back and,

550
00:13:04.431 --> 00:13:04.701
and,

551
00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:05.260
and make,

552
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.000
make a really strong,

553
00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:08.253
uh,

554
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.250
performing very strong next performance.

555
00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:13.391
I just really wanted to,

556
00:13:13.391 --> 00:13:15.940
I had my eyes on that goal and,

557
00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:16.870
and uh,

558
00:13:16.871 --> 00:13:17.630
and then the,

559
00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:18.070
they met,

560
00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:19.600
I actually count and almost,

561
00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.080
uh,

562
00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:20.740
you know,

563
00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:21.580
fighting DC,

564
00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:22.511
but then,

565
00:13:22.511 --> 00:13:24.370
then it was all gone by him going up the step.

566
00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:25.204
And so,

567
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:26.200
so it's,

568
00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:27.870
it's a crisis situation.

569
00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:30.640
The whole division is just crazy right now.

570
00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:31.031
Yeah,

571
00:13:31.031 --> 00:13:34.600
it really is because that fight is not even going to take place until July.

572
00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:36.310
So here we are in April,

573
00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:37.540
May,

574
00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:37.540
June,

575
00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:37.541
July,

576
00:13:37.541 --> 00:13:42.541
we are three months till that fight takes place that fight and then obviously at

577
00:13:43.181 --> 00:13:44.230
least three months,

578
00:13:44.231 --> 00:13:47.560
most likely more before the title could be challenged again.

579
00:13:47.561 --> 00:13:48.394
So that's,

580
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:49.720
we don't even know if it's coming,

581
00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.673
if it comes back.

582
00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:50.951
Right.

583
00:13:50.951 --> 00:13:53.920
He might notice what happens in that fight unless once he gets used to eating

584
00:13:53.921 --> 00:13:54.754
again,

585
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:55.421
like you know,

586
00:13:55.421 --> 00:13:56.310
it's going to be a tough one.

587
00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.153
You see wins.

588
00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:58.860
I see it in pictures now.

589
00:13:59.000 --> 00:13:59.260
You know,

590
00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:00.610
I'm going to meet him a couple of days.

591
00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:03.160
It looks a little bit,

592
00:14:03.161 --> 00:14:03.401
you know,

593
00:14:03.401 --> 00:14:04.090
heavy right now.

594
00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:07.790
Well he was a on TV the other day eating potato chips and you're in a cab.

595
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:09.760
No,

596
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.470
he loved that.

597
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:10.810
Yeah.

598
00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:11.590
He loves food,

599
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:12.400
that's for sure.

600
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:12.880
I mean,

601
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:13.690
and uh,

602
00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:14.260
I,

603
00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:14.651
you know,

604
00:14:14.651 --> 00:14:17.710
you look back at his performance in strike force as a heavyweight and it was

605
00:14:17.711 --> 00:14:18.240
phenomenal.

606
00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:18.421
Good,

607
00:14:18.421 --> 00:14:18.940
good,

608
00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:19.560
phenomenal.

609
00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.393
If you didn't lose,

610
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:25.450
he didn't lose that heavyweight and he's good tossed around gorillas like Josh

611
00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:28.090
Barnett lift him up like nothing crazy.

612
00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:30.810
It'll be this fight against TTIP is,

613
00:14:30.811 --> 00:14:31.644
uh,

614
00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:33.280
you know,

615
00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.570
if it will be another,

616
00:14:34.571 --> 00:14:35.560
I guess another heavyweight,

617
00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:37.120
I'll probably 60 people are going to win this fight.

618
00:14:37.121 --> 00:14:37.601
But do you see,

619
00:14:37.601 --> 00:14:38.500
is like you said,

620
00:14:38.501 --> 00:14:39.334
he's,

621
00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:40.960
he's a really good heavyweight,

622
00:14:40.961 --> 00:14:41.651
so when those,

623
00:14:41.651 --> 00:14:42.220
what happens?

624
00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:42.351
Well,

625
00:14:42.351 --> 00:14:44.380
his wrestling is just so next level.

626
00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:45.610
It's such a,

627
00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:49.300
it's an interesting position because Steve Bay is a very good wrestler.

628
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.460
But of course DC's worldclass today's world class and he,

629
00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.140
he doesn't take one step back.

630
00:14:54.141 --> 00:14:55.700
May just comes out to he's being,

631
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:57.050
he's just in your face.

632
00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.260
And it's tough to count out Steve Bay too,

633
00:15:00.261 --> 00:15:02.990
because Steve Bay is though pound for pound consensus.

634
00:15:02.991 --> 00:15:03.950
Best heavy weight ever.

635
00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:04.341
I mean,

636
00:15:04.341 --> 00:15:06.140
the guy has defended the title more than anybody.

637
00:15:06.141 --> 00:15:07.130
You look at his resume,

638
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:08.173
it's impeccable.

639
00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:13.270
And Max out a junior dos Santos knocks out Overeem a beats Francis in Ghana who

640
00:15:13.701 --> 00:15:14.780
was everybody's scared of.

641
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:15.703
I mean,

642
00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:17.683
he's a bad ass.

643
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:18.530
Yeah.

644
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:19.640
So you know,

645
00:15:19.641 --> 00:15:20.520
but the seats,

646
00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:21.770
he such a competitive guy,

647
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:22.790
he does,

648
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:23.361
he doesn't want,

649
00:15:23.361 --> 00:15:25.160
he doesn't take a step back and he just goes for it.

650
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:26.360
Even if,

651
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.610
even if Tufts situation,

652
00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:28.070
he's just,

653
00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:31.280
he just eats it and comes back and do what to do always.

654
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.470
And then for being a fat guy,

655
00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:34.923
that guy,

656
00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:36.950
that guy works,

657
00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.360
he's screaming at you right now.

658
00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:39.223
Hey man,

659
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.063
settle down.

660
00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:41.420
But that guy is,

661
00:15:41.421 --> 00:15:42.530
he's doing fire rounds.

662
00:15:42.531 --> 00:15:43.300
Like nothing.

663
00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.120
Yeah.

664
00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.030
So the conditioning is some top.

665
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:46.461
Yeah,

666
00:15:46.461 --> 00:15:48.650
he just eats the wrong food.

667
00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:49.820
That's all it does.

668
00:15:49.821 --> 00:15:50.450
Yeah.

669
00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:50.900
I mean,

670
00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.730
I mean maybe some of it's genetic.

671
00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.620
I just think it as eating the wrong food.

672
00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.150
I mean there's evidence.

673
00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:57.550
Sure.

674
00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:57.970
Chips.

675
00:15:57.970 --> 00:15:58.803
Yeah.

676
00:15:58.910 --> 00:15:59.750
I mean there was evidence.

677
00:15:59.751 --> 00:16:01.100
It's not like I'm just talking out of my ass.

678
00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:03.330
I've seen him eat the wrong food and me too.

679
00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:04.851
But yeah,

680
00:16:04.851 --> 00:16:06.020
nothing but respect for that guy.

681
00:16:06.021 --> 00:16:10.070
He's an awesome human being to see is just fantastic guy.

682
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:12.350
Have you ever thought about fighting heavyweight?

683
00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:14.990
Cross my mind from time to time,

684
00:16:14.991 --> 00:16:16.600
but I feel I'm,

685
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:20.450
I'm not done with not done in light type way yet.

686
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.190
I have still things to do.

687
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:23.360
What do you walk around at?

688
00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:24.593
How I'm heavy.

689
00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:29.390
I'm heavy like what I'm calling DCFS but probably shouldn't say anything.

690
00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:30.141
Yeah.

691
00:16:30.141 --> 00:16:32.930
But you have been in America for two days.

692
00:16:32.931 --> 00:16:35.010
I can directly compounds being here.

693
00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.870
All our GMO food flux.

694
00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:38.870
So like what,

695
00:16:38.871 --> 00:16:39.350
what,

696
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:42.740
when you normally are getting down to two oh five what do you walk around at

697
00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:47.860
two you know,

698
00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.470
maybe I'll stop my camps to 35 really?

699
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:51.430
Wow.

700
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:52.263
Yeah.

701
00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:53.840
I go up to two photos sometimes.

702
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:54.703
No kidding.

703
00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:55.370
Wow.

704
00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:55.471
Oh,

705
00:16:55.471 --> 00:16:57.560
you healthy at two 40 or are you just like,

706
00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:58.670
I moved like never before.

707
00:16:59.050 --> 00:16:59.660
It's crazy.

708
00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:00.021
Really?

709
00:17:00.021 --> 00:17:00.261
Yeah,

710
00:17:00.261 --> 00:17:01.094
I do.

711
00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:02.123
I've got some speed in my,

712
00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:02.520
my,

713
00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.261
my footwork.

714
00:17:03.261 --> 00:17:04.910
I just do you feel good at two 40?

715
00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.710
I feel pretty good being heavy.

716
00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:07.390
I do.

717
00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:07.550
And,

718
00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:08.570
and I feel strong.

719
00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:09.520
I feel strong.

720
00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:10.610
I spawn big guys.

721
00:17:10.611 --> 00:17:14.600
I was pulling heavy guys and I feel really strong in being a heavyweight,

722
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:15.463
but,

723
00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:16.910
but uh,

724
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:17.781
like I told you,

725
00:17:17.781 --> 00:17:17.961
man,

726
00:17:17.961 --> 00:17:18.141
I'm,

727
00:17:18.141 --> 00:17:19.250
I'm not finishing right yet.

728
00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.240
I understand.

729
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:20.721
I understand.

730
00:17:20.721 --> 00:17:23.480
But how much of you gets diminished in that cut to two?

731
00:17:23.481 --> 00:17:24.314
Oh five.

732
00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:25.250
Not that bad.

733
00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:25.961
It's like,

734
00:17:25.961 --> 00:17:26.261
you know,

735
00:17:26.261 --> 00:17:28.700
when I stopped because of Csun,

736
00:17:28.701 --> 00:17:29.031
I do,

737
00:17:29.031 --> 00:17:30.920
maybe off season,

738
00:17:30.921 --> 00:17:31.754
I do,

739
00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.730
I do eight to 10 sessions a week.

740
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:35.683
Uh,

741
00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:36.920
I don't stress,

742
00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.113
you know,

743
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:39.770
I don't eat shit food.

744
00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:40.740
I of course I,

745
00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:42.380
sometimes I drink a couple of bears,

746
00:17:42.381 --> 00:17:43.820
so I have a pizza,

747
00:17:43.821 --> 00:17:44.091
whatever,

748
00:17:44.091 --> 00:17:44.261
you know,

749
00:17:44.261 --> 00:17:46.480
I'm a have to live sometimes,

750
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.180
you know,

751
00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:47.510
but,

752
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.670
uh,

753
00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:49.770
it's a good,

754
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:51.383
<v 1>good,</v>

755
00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:52.590
good regular meals.

756
00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:53.433
Uh,

757
00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:54.683
doing a little bit,

758
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.920
lifting some,

759
00:17:55.921 --> 00:17:56.220
some,

760
00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:56.551
some,

761
00:17:56.551 --> 00:17:57.181
some weights.

762
00:17:57.181 --> 00:17:57.570
And,

763
00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:58.403
uh,

764
00:17:58.820 --> 00:17:59.490
and I,

765
00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:00.290
and when I started,

766
00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:01.320
when I stopped my camps,

767
00:18:01.321 --> 00:18:02.640
it's like my body feels like,

768
00:18:02.641 --> 00:18:02.851
okay,

769
00:18:02.851 --> 00:18:04.820
it's time now to start working here and,

770
00:18:04.821 --> 00:18:06.650
and I start doing my sprints and my,

771
00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:06.910
my,

772
00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:08.280
my miles on the treadmill.

773
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:09.900
Um,

774
00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:10.290
you know,

775
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:12.840
from one week to another I maybe lose like 10 pounds.

776
00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:13.620
It's crazy.

777
00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:13.830
It's,

778
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:15.390
it's like my bud just knows,

779
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:15.661
okay,

780
00:18:15.661 --> 00:18:17.250
it's time to work and then I drips,

781
00:18:17.251 --> 00:18:18.210
drops like nothing.

782
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:18.541
Wow.

783
00:18:18.541 --> 00:18:21.060
So you bought it just accustomed to your job and I fit.

784
00:18:21.061 --> 00:18:21.894
It's because,

785
00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:22.590
you know,

786
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:24.420
I've done it many times.

787
00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:25.980
So it's just like,

788
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.180
you know the routines.

789
00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:27.751
No.

790
00:18:27.751 --> 00:18:30.780
I know you do a lot of hunting and you were showing me some photos before the

791
00:18:30.781 --> 00:18:31.351
podcast.

792
00:18:31.351 --> 00:18:33.600
Do you incorporate wild game into your diet?

793
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:34.613
That's all I do.

794
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:35.130
Yeah.

795
00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:35.963
That's all I do.

796
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:38.130
I wouldn't say never,

797
00:18:38.131 --> 00:18:43.131
but I barely buy anything from the store when it comes to meat or all that.

798
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:44.040
I just hadn't,

799
00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.600
I just hunt everything I eat.

800
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.630
I tried to support my family with,

801
00:18:47.631 --> 00:18:47.841
with,

802
00:18:47.841 --> 00:18:48.141
with,

803
00:18:48.141 --> 00:18:48.680
with the,

804
00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:49.980
with what I'm hunting,

805
00:18:49.981 --> 00:18:50.191
you know,

806
00:18:50.191 --> 00:18:50.970
we got to,

807
00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:52.290
I'm hunting a lot of wild boars.

808
00:18:52.291 --> 00:18:54.450
We have what a lot of water bores and Sweden,

809
00:18:54.451 --> 00:18:55.920
I'm a hunting days.

810
00:18:55.921 --> 00:18:56.830
We got to read their fellow.

811
00:18:56.831 --> 00:18:58.220
There's a,

812
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:59.150
we got Moose.

813
00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:00.123
Uh,

814
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:01.900
and you can't compare the meat.

815
00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.590
It's as long as it's,

816
00:19:04.591 --> 00:19:04.930
it's a,

817
00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:06.300
it's a science just to cook it.

818
00:19:06.301 --> 00:19:06.660
Right.

819
00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:08.070
But if you cook it right and,

820
00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:09.870
and you know what you're doing,

821
00:19:09.871 --> 00:19:11.040
it's the best thing ever.

822
00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:11.371
Yeah,

823
00:19:11.371 --> 00:19:11.941
I agree.

824
00:19:11.941 --> 00:19:15.390
And I've always wondered like as a professional athlete what it would be like,

825
00:19:15.391 --> 00:19:19.410
like whether or not you see the benefit in eating such protein rich,

826
00:19:19.411 --> 00:19:24.411
nutrient dense meat as opposed to pasture raised or farming know I can compare

827
00:19:24.691 --> 00:19:25.240
it.

828
00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.073
We can't compare it.

829
00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:26.290
And,

830
00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:26.870
and,

831
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:27.703
and,

832
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:29.760
and everything around it too.

833
00:19:29.761 --> 00:19:30.100
You know,

834
00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:30.330
it,

835
00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:31.320
they've suffering,

836
00:19:31.321 --> 00:19:32.910
they do it like it's not a good,

837
00:19:32.911 --> 00:19:33.691
it's not a good business.

838
00:19:33.691 --> 00:19:33.930
You know,

839
00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:34.820
I don't like that based on it.

840
00:19:34.821 --> 00:19:35.850
I don't want to support it all.

841
00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:37.260
So I read it to my hunting.

842
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:37.951
No,

843
00:19:37.951 --> 00:19:38.551
I agree.

844
00:19:38.551 --> 00:19:40.110
And I mean there's,

845
00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:41.880
to me it's the best way.

846
00:19:41.881 --> 00:19:42.840
If you're going to eat meat,

847
00:19:42.841 --> 00:19:44.010
it's absolutely the best way.

848
00:19:44.011 --> 00:19:45.480
But what I'm thinking is like,

849
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:49.980
I don't know a lot of pro athletes that only eat wild game and only hunt wild

850
00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:50.221
game,

851
00:19:50.221 --> 00:19:52.980
but I would think that there would be a great benefit in that 100%,

852
00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:53.700
100%.

853
00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:58.110
You can't get better nutrition to your body than eating,

854
00:19:58.111 --> 00:19:58.950
eating that meat.

855
00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.180
It's the best thing there is.

856
00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:01.950
And I feel even like,

857
00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.290
just how do you feel after eating?

858
00:20:04.291 --> 00:20:04.561
Like,

859
00:20:04.561 --> 00:20:05.280
uh,

860
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:05.580
like,

861
00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:06.413
uh,

862
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:07.570
for,

863
00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:07.980
for,

864
00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:08.510
for,

865
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:09.343
for uh,

866
00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:09.850
uh,

867
00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:14.850
a 400 gram steak all through eating like a 400 gram,

868
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:17.400
whatever dear readers you've been hunting,

869
00:20:17.401 --> 00:20:18.240
you don't feel the same.

870
00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.410
It all for you don't feel tired.

871
00:20:19.411 --> 00:20:22.760
He don't feel like you're getting this food coma and stuff like that.

872
00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:23.603
You feel fresh.

873
00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:24.420
Yeah.

874
00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:24.870
Fresh.

875
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:25.501
It's weird,

876
00:20:25.501 --> 00:20:25.741
right?

877
00:20:25.741 --> 00:20:26.940
It's a wild game.

878
00:20:26.941 --> 00:20:31.941
Has Almost an invigorating sensation to it when they need it actually feels you

879
00:20:32.071 --> 00:20:33.210
feel and you feel strong.

880
00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.410
You feel good about doing it.

881
00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:35.580
How long have you been hunting?

882
00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:38.430
I've been hunting since a kid.

883
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:40.540
Grow up on a form and,

884
00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:40.881
and,

885
00:20:40.881 --> 00:20:41.401
and my,

886
00:20:41.401 --> 00:20:45.500
my dad was hunting a lot when I was a kid and then I didn't hunt for,

887
00:20:45.501 --> 00:20:46.380
for a long time.

888
00:20:46.381 --> 00:20:47.980
And I get back to 2012

889
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:48.580
<v 2>actually,</v>

890
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:49.980
I took my license and,

891
00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:51.800
and uh,

892
00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:54.880
just an off than I had been hunting.

893
00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:55.890
If I don't train,

894
00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:56.800
I'm outdoors.

895
00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.620
If I don't train on outdoors and we have seasons in Sweden,

896
00:20:59.621 --> 00:21:02.230
so it's not like you're hunting all year round,

897
00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:03.310
but uh,

898
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:04.680
but I'll make sure I,

899
00:21:04.681 --> 00:21:06.730
I feel the freezer on the Dell seasons.

900
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:07.990
Um,

901
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:09.040
so yeah.

902
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.120
And I'm not training on hunting.

903
00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:11.100
That's awesome.

904
00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:11.191
Well,

905
00:21:11.191 --> 00:21:12.190
you don't use bowls there though.

906
00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:12.770
It's not easy.

907
00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:14.920
It's not on the guns.

908
00:21:14.921 --> 00:21:16.190
A lot of European countries.

909
00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:17.590
I know in Spain it's legal.

910
00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:18.050
I,

911
00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:18.760
yeah.

912
00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.010
In Spain where you said you hunted those red deer.

913
00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:21.360
Yeah.

914
00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:21.690
Yeah.

915
00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:24.550
Can I have a friend of mine who lives in Spain and he's a big bow hunter.

916
00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:24.791
Oh,

917
00:21:24.791 --> 00:21:25.150
okay.

918
00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:25.540
Yeah.

919
00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:25.721
No,

920
00:21:25.721 --> 00:21:27.040
it's only rifles and Sweden.

921
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:27.760
Yeah.

922
00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:28.660
But that works too,

923
00:21:28.661 --> 00:21:28.960
man.

924
00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:29.580
It works.

925
00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:29.740
Yeah.

926
00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:30.071
I mean,

927
00:21:30.071 --> 00:21:32.080
it's the most effective way for sure.

928
00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:34.460
And obviously it shoot them at a higher distance and it is,

929
00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:36.140
a lot of people think it's more humane to,

930
00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:38.200
if you're not good with a bow there.

931
00:21:38.201 --> 00:21:38.740
Right?

932
00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:39.250
Yeah,

933
00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:39.640
yeah.

934
00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:40.150
You know,

935
00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:43.600
but when it comes to the feeling of being outdoors,

936
00:21:43.601 --> 00:21:44.400
being close to the,

937
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:44.950
to,

938
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:47.320
to the being close to the animal and stuff like that,

939
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:49.060
I don't even think you can compare it to,

940
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.420
to,

941
00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:51.010
to actually the bow hunting.

942
00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.340
It's a whole night of technique is how the way to to hunt.

943
00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.680
Well guy like you who loves challenges,

944
00:21:56.681 --> 00:21:58.880
who thrives off of that you would do with thrive.

945
00:21:58.881 --> 00:21:59.380
I've done it,

946
00:21:59.380 --> 00:21:59.721
but if,

947
00:21:59.721 --> 00:22:00.250
if I,

948
00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:00.741
if I tried,

949
00:22:00.741 --> 00:22:01.450
I probably love it.

950
00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:02.111
This is a man.

951
00:22:02.111 --> 00:22:02.944
I'll hook you up.

952
00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:04.030
I appreciate that at all.

953
00:22:04.031 --> 00:22:07.410
On the back I'll be back and my friend John Dudley is tall like you too.

954
00:22:07.411 --> 00:22:09.010
So He'd be the perfect guy to coach you.

955
00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:09.270
He,

956
00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:11.980
it sounds great to you and take you out on a hunt.

957
00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:12.251
Yeah.

958
00:22:12.251 --> 00:22:13.210
Now I can't wait man.

959
00:22:13.211 --> 00:22:13.690
I love that.

960
00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:13.841
Well,

961
00:22:13.841 --> 00:22:15.220
especially wild pigs.

962
00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:18.240
There's a place that he has an Oklahoma that uh,

963
00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:18.471
they,

964
00:22:18.471 --> 00:22:19.720
they hunt a lot of wild pigs.

965
00:22:19.721 --> 00:22:21.000
I mean they just have to eradicate them.

966
00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:21.850
There's so many of them.

967
00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:22.863
I heard about it.

968
00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:23.440
Yeah,

969
00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.220
it's too many.

970
00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:24.850
It's too many.

971
00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:25.360
It's,

972
00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:26.193
I heard it's,

973
00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:28.930
and how the anthem to is kind of crazy.

974
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.261
Oh,

975
00:22:29.261 --> 00:22:30.950
the ones in Texas where the deaf from helicopter,

976
00:22:30.951 --> 00:22:34.840
I saw that on youtube channels and stuff like that going crazy down there.

977
00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:35.920
They just have to,

978
00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:38.950
I mean Texas is so big and there's so many pigs.

979
00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.630
There's millions and millions of pigs there.

980
00:22:40.631 --> 00:22:41.920
And they're constantly breeding.

981
00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:43.090
Yeah.

982
00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:43.871
They'll have like three,

983
00:22:43.871 --> 00:22:46.000
four little g year and each litter they'll have four,

984
00:22:46.001 --> 00:22:49.090
six piglets and they just keep going and going and going and going and it just

985
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:50.171
no end or,

986
00:22:50.171 --> 00:22:50.620
whoa.

987
00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.300
And they don't have very many predators.

988
00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:54.580
A few mountain lines take them out occasionally.

989
00:22:54.581 --> 00:22:55.120
Yeah.

990
00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:55.781
For the most part,

991
00:22:55.781 --> 00:22:57.610
they just running and gunning and they keep breeding.

992
00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:58.630
Did it get big in here?

993
00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:01.260
They do big several halls.

994
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:02.143
Pounds.

995
00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:02.780
Yeah.

996
00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:04.510
It was common to see three,

997
00:23:04.511 --> 00:23:05.590
400 pound pigs.

998
00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.350
Well in Sweden,

999
00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:07.721
Sweden,

1000
00:23:07.721 --> 00:23:09.280
there we have a couple of them,

1001
00:23:09.281 --> 00:23:11.170
but they don't get that big though.

1002
00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.620
And the thing is,

1003
00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:15.370
how are we hunting in Sweden is when the farmers,

1004
00:23:15.371 --> 00:23:15.821
when they,

1005
00:23:15.821 --> 00:23:16.180
you know,

1006
00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:17.830
they had all their acres and all the,

1007
00:23:17.831 --> 00:23:18.101
you know,

1008
00:23:18.101 --> 00:23:18.934
the lands,

1009
00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:22.900
they actually called us in because the pigs to help them out.

1010
00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:23.660
Then we just,

1011
00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:24.760
I'll do it all night.

1012
00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:26.140
The Sun never goes down.

1013
00:23:26.141 --> 00:23:27.120
And Sweden in summertimes.

1014
00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:27.811
Oh really?

1015
00:23:27.811 --> 00:23:29.080
Now we had like a midnight sun.

1016
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:30.463
So it,

1017
00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:32.350
it's so cozy being out there.

1018
00:23:32.351 --> 00:23:33.460
It's kind of warm.

1019
00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:38.380
It's nice you going around checking the lance and it's pretty good man.

1020
00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:39.190
You would like it.

1021
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:40.150
I'm sure I would.

1022
00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:42.460
I've only been to Sweden once for the UFC when I was there,

1023
00:23:42.461 --> 00:23:43.200
but I loved it.

1024
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.350
Them beautiful city.

1025
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:45.230
Fantastic.

1026
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:45.530
Really,

1027
00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:46.070
really enjoyed

1028
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.490
<v 1>it there.</v>

1029
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:46.970
Thank you.

1030
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:48.020
Very nice people too.

1031
00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:48.201
Oh,

1032
00:23:48.201 --> 00:23:48.680
they are?

1033
00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:49.513
We are.

1034
00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:50.150
We are.

1035
00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:50.860
So,

1036
00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:53.300
so how did you get aligned with alliance?

1037
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:53.931
How did that,

1038
00:23:53.931 --> 00:23:57.320
how did that wind up happening where you started coming to America to train and

1039
00:23:57.321 --> 00:24:00.890
how far into your career was that right off the full fight.

1040
00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:01.970
Really?

1041
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:02.480
Yeah.

1042
00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.380
Right off the fill fight.

1043
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:05.570
And back then we didn't,

1044
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:07.800
we didn't have those resources in,

1045
00:24:07.801 --> 00:24:08.031
in,

1046
00:24:08.031 --> 00:24:09.350
in Stockholm at all.

1047
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:10.490
And you say Phil Davis,

1048
00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:15.260
we're talking about on the full is also an alliance fighter.

1049
00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:15.800
Yeah.

1050
00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:16.760
Which is pretty cool man.

1051
00:24:16.761 --> 00:24:18.830
That you guys fought and then you went to train with them.

1052
00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:19.753
Yeah.

1053
00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:20.130
What,

1054
00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:20.290
how,

1055
00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:21.123
how'd that work out?

1056
00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:22.320
It wasn't good.

1057
00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:22.561
You know,

1058
00:24:22.561 --> 00:24:23.000
he,

1059
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.960
he just kicked my ass to for the first couple of times before I foster learning

1060
00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:29.050
the whole wrestling part and yeah.

1061
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:33.550
How even to defend a take down and then after that I just become good at and,

1062
00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:34.370
and uh,

1063
00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:36.110
I really enjoy enjoying coming,

1064
00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:36.741
coming down here,

1065
00:24:36.741 --> 00:24:39.890
meeting the guys and train and it's a whole nother type of life.

1066
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:40.101
Well,

1067
00:24:40.101 --> 00:24:44.660
it's so cool that he accepted you after you were opponent too.

1068
00:24:44.661 --> 00:24:46.550
And how'd you come and learn with them?

1069
00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:49.123
Yeah,

1070
00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:49.640
we do.

1071
00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:51.710
We just talked off to the fight right away and,

1072
00:24:51.711 --> 00:24:52.790
and uh,

1073
00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:54.020
you know,

1074
00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:54.853
I just,

1075
00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.290
I just swallowed my pride and I would just talk to them,

1076
00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:01.010
talk to him after the fight and I know he invited me over and,

1077
00:25:01.011 --> 00:25:02.060
and uh,

1078
00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:03.433
and uh,

1079
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:04.701
I can,

1080
00:25:04.701 --> 00:25:05.151
we just can,

1081
00:25:05.151 --> 00:25:08.000
meaning my culture just came over and we had no idea what to expect.

1082
00:25:08.001 --> 00:25:09.680
And I remember we just,

1083
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:12.560
we just landed now we landed at nighttime,

1084
00:25:12.561 --> 00:25:13.760
so we went to the gym to sleep.

1085
00:25:13.761 --> 00:25:18.650
I woke up the day after and I was hitting someone hitting the bags down there,

1086
00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:22.700
like in the math area early now,

1087
00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:23.421
super early.

1088
00:25:23.421 --> 00:25:23.841
I'm like,

1089
00:25:23.841 --> 00:25:24.381
who's this?

1090
00:25:24.381 --> 00:25:24.890
I went down,

1091
00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:25.580
it was filled,

1092
00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:27.980
it was hitting the bags and I felt so like,

1093
00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:28.371
oh damn,

1094
00:25:28.371 --> 00:25:29.120
I have to do this too.

1095
00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.310
After that we started to like,

1096
00:25:31.311 --> 00:25:32.144
you know,

1097
00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:32.991
trying to get it.

1098
00:25:32.991 --> 00:25:34.910
So it was a really good time.

1099
00:25:34.911 --> 00:25:38.030
And then he came actually down to to us to help me out with,

1100
00:25:38.031 --> 00:25:39.080
we'd love to share too.

1101
00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.520
So he went to Sweden?

1102
00:25:40.521 --> 00:25:41.354
Yeah,

1103
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.870
yeah,

1104
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:42.710
for a couple of weeks.

1105
00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.370
So any fault.

1106
00:25:45.371 --> 00:25:45.921
Love it too.

1107
00:25:45.921 --> 00:25:47.010
And that and you know,

1108
00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:47.570
it's,

1109
00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:51.050
it means so much to me to have these guys training with me,

1110
00:25:51.051 --> 00:25:51.500
you know,

1111
00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:56.500
with feel illy Latifi we have Jimmy Montoya and all those go such great guys and

1112
00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:58.700
love training with them and it makes,

1113
00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:00.200
it makes my training just,

1114
00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:01.333
I just upset,

1115
00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:02.750
you know,

1116
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:03.830
steps up even more.

1117
00:26:03.831 --> 00:26:04.191
We have,

1118
00:26:04.191 --> 00:26:05.210
we have bunch of guys,

1119
00:26:05.211 --> 00:26:06.650
we have like Russian companies.

1120
00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.670
We established a really good place now.

1121
00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:10.580
It all starts in,

1122
00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.260
in Sweden and Europe,

1123
00:26:12.261 --> 00:26:15.870
around around Europe and and getting so much good guy in my,

1124
00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:19.700
in my level of firing just rises to the top man.

1125
00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:20.533
I'm telling you if,

1126
00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:20.841
if I,

1127
00:26:20.841 --> 00:26:22.700
if I spar with field Jimmy or,

1128
00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:23.450
or earlier,

1129
00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:25.510
I just feel like every day,

1130
00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:26.660
every day's a fight.

1131
00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:27.400
You know,

1132
00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:27.551
you,

1133
00:26:27.551 --> 00:26:28.750
you can be relaxed.

1134
00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:29.450
You can't just throw,

1135
00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:31.100
Jab and don't care about the calendar.

1136
00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:34.070
You have to such amazing training.

1137
00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:35.511
Fantastic too.

1138
00:26:35.511 --> 00:26:36.650
Over the last decade,

1139
00:26:36.651 --> 00:26:39.740
the level of talent that's coming out of Europe has just escalated.

1140
00:26:39.741 --> 00:26:41.030
It's been so different.

1141
00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:41.871
It's so big.

1142
00:26:41.871 --> 00:26:43.290
And the wrestling too,

1143
00:26:43.291 --> 00:26:44.370
which is a big part of it.

1144
00:26:44.371 --> 00:26:45.540
So much more wrestling.

1145
00:26:45.541 --> 00:26:46.010
So much.

1146
00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:46.920
So much more talent.

1147
00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:47.911
I exactly know.

1148
00:26:47.911 --> 00:26:49.020
We know we have,

1149
00:26:49.021 --> 00:26:49.381
we have,

1150
00:26:49.381 --> 00:26:50.550
we have guys coming from,

1151
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:50.940
from,

1152
00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:53.410
from Hispanic Estann.

1153
00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:57.080
We have different Russian countries down there to coming in and they'll guys a

1154
00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.470
beast beast and they're there.

1155
00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:02.030
The drive in there,

1156
00:27:02.031 --> 00:27:04.060
they're the double legs to take downs stay.

1157
00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:06.480
And the Ed charts though they chose,

1158
00:27:06.481 --> 00:27:08.530
they take it like nothing and they just comes out too.

1159
00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:09.210
So they make,

1160
00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:12.420
they make me work a lot and yeah,

1161
00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:14.130
that's exactly what I need.

1162
00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:15.180
Exactly what I need.

1163
00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:15.391
Yeah.

1164
00:27:15.391 --> 00:27:18.240
That's been one of the more interesting things over the last five or six years

1165
00:27:18.241 --> 00:27:21.810
is the rise of the Russians and so many from the Soviet,

1166
00:27:21.811 --> 00:27:22.800
former Soviet Union.

1167
00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:23.730
Yep.

1168
00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:24.090
Yeah.

1169
00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:26.170
Now they're there and they have such a,

1170
00:27:26.171 --> 00:27:28.320
there's such a working capital capacity.

1171
00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:29.610
They work a lot.

1172
00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:32.690
We have a couple of guys down at the gym now and you know,

1173
00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:33.960
they're,

1174
00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:34.471
that's the gym.

1175
00:27:34.471 --> 00:27:35.161
When I come to the gym,

1176
00:27:35.161 --> 00:27:35.551
that the gym,

1177
00:27:35.551 --> 00:27:38.040
when I leave the gym and never leave that way,

1178
00:27:38.041 --> 00:27:38.874
they live in their dollar.

1179
00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:40.230
So they never leave basically.

1180
00:27:40.231 --> 00:27:40.800
But,

1181
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:41.650
but in the last,

1182
00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:42.513
so they actually do,

1183
00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:44.900
we have a facility that we,

1184
00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:46.270
so people can stay and,

1185
00:27:46.271 --> 00:27:46.431
and,

1186
00:27:46.431 --> 00:27:46.721
and,

1187
00:27:46.721 --> 00:27:47.460
and,

1188
00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:47.700
you know,

1189
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:48.350
train.

1190
00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:49.130
So that's excellent.

1191
00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:49.470
Yeah.

1192
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:50.040
Yeah.

1193
00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:50.610
So,

1194
00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:51.443
but they,

1195
00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:52.591
they just work,

1196
00:27:52.591 --> 00:27:53.120
man.

1197
00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.180
We work all day long.

1198
00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:59.280
That's a great asset to have a facility where people can train and live there.

1199
00:27:59.281 --> 00:28:03.060
I know American top team puts something like that in Winkeljohn and um,

1200
00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:03.360
uh,

1201
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.890
Greg Jackson put something like that and yeah,

1202
00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:06.540
that,

1203
00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:10.520
that's got to help so much where young guys who don't have much money but you

1204
00:28:10.521 --> 00:28:10.650
know,

1205
00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:12.660
100% train 100%,

1206
00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:14.940
it's a really good way to also to,

1207
00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:15.390
you know,

1208
00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:16.410
give something back,

1209
00:28:16.411 --> 00:28:16.651
man.

1210
00:28:16.651 --> 00:28:17.120
It's,

1211
00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:17.590
you know,

1212
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.920
the,

1213
00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:18.420
they,

1214
00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:20.070
they have their rooms to sleep in.

1215
00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:21.400
We manage.

1216
00:28:21.401 --> 00:28:21.810
So they,

1217
00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:23.390
they have really good foods in,

1218
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.740
you know,

1219
00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:24.390
to,

1220
00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:26.280
to bring lunches and stuff.

1221
00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:27.793
Uh,

1222
00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:28.711
so,

1223
00:28:28.711 --> 00:28:28.860
uh,

1224
00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:29.601
we also go at it.

1225
00:28:29.601 --> 00:28:31.440
We've also got it from here because we,

1226
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:32.011
at the beginning,

1227
00:28:32.011 --> 00:28:33.270
when we came to San Diego,

1228
00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:34.263
like I saw it,

1229
00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:35.760
it was another top of training,

1230
00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:36.720
not the type of lifestyle.

1231
00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:37.921
And we sold that.

1232
00:28:37.921 --> 00:28:38.754
Me and my coach.

1233
00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:39.391
There's Michael.

1234
00:28:39.391 --> 00:28:40.190
So,

1235
00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:41.023
uh,

1236
00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:42.083
we just,

1237
00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.250
after doing this years and years and years,

1238
00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:45.563
uh,

1239
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:50.220
we now manage to do it at home and I just love it.

1240
00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:50.670
You know,

1241
00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:50.851
I'll be,

1242
00:28:50.851 --> 00:28:51.181
I'll be,

1243
00:28:51.181 --> 00:28:51.871
I'll be traveling.

1244
00:28:51.871 --> 00:28:53.640
I've been traveling all my,

1245
00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:55.510
all my career to,

1246
00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:56.000
to,

1247
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.320
to America to train and around the place.

1248
00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:00.900
So I now we established a good,

1249
00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:05.580
good training system that works and we establish it good.

1250
00:29:05.581 --> 00:29:07.130
And I feel great to be home,

1251
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:08.023
Eh,

1252
00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:08.963
Eh,

1253
00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:09.361
you know,

1254
00:29:09.361 --> 00:29:10.880
when you're getting the faculty and stuff.

1255
00:29:10.881 --> 00:29:13.320
I'm 31 years old and it works,

1256
00:29:13.321 --> 00:29:13.471
man.

1257
00:29:13.471 --> 00:29:14.304
It works.

1258
00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:18.450
I know it'd been as that shape on my life then I've been like training at home

1259
00:29:18.451 --> 00:29:19.410
and feeling good.

1260
00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:20.431
That's fantastic.

1261
00:29:20.431 --> 00:29:23.730
We don't have to drain yourself by flying over across the country,

1262
00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.140
staying somewhere you don't know.

1263
00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:25.711
Exactly.

1264
00:29:25.711 --> 00:29:26.544
Yeah.

1265
00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:31.140
You're a real pioneer in terms of like European mixed martial arts.

1266
00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:35.010
What is it like now seeing all this sort of explode around you?

1267
00:29:35.011 --> 00:29:35.191
I mean,

1268
00:29:35.191 --> 00:29:38.280
it's become so popular all over the world now.

1269
00:29:38.281 --> 00:29:42.340
I mean MMA from when you started 10 ago to now,

1270
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:43.720
<v 0>it's barely recognizable.</v>

1271
00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:43.951
No,

1272
00:29:43.951 --> 00:29:45.010
you're with a gangster back down.

1273
00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:45.500
Yeah.

1274
00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:45.920
Oh,

1275
00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.753
you're a psychopath.

1276
00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:49.330
Either one or two of those when you're training like,

1277
00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:50.600
and yeah,

1278
00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.160
<v 1>but nowadays it's amazing.</v>

1279
00:29:52.161 --> 00:29:52.491
You know,

1280
00:29:52.491 --> 00:29:53.690
you have a walk around in the stall,

1281
00:29:53.691 --> 00:29:54.341
Coleman and,

1282
00:29:54.341 --> 00:29:56.680
and people are John Keys.

1283
00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:59.810
They know even more than I know about techniques,

1284
00:29:59.811 --> 00:30:00.340
about,

1285
00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:05.340
about the sport we have all ladies and gentleman is coming in one,

1286
00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:08.110
one an autograph or a picture.

1287
00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:08.910
It's,

1288
00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:10.340
it's grown so much.

1289
00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:10.581
It's,

1290
00:30:10.581 --> 00:30:10.941
it's,

1291
00:30:10.941 --> 00:30:11.360
uh,

1292
00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:11.841
like you say,

1293
00:30:11.841 --> 00:30:13.370
it's been expelled it all over the world.

1294
00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:16.640
<v 0>Now what I was getting at was that when you first started out,</v>

1295
00:30:16.641 --> 00:30:18.380
how much of a structure was in place?

1296
00:30:18.381 --> 00:30:21.200
Like in terms of like how much strength and conditioning you should do,

1297
00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.000
how much sparring you should do,

1298
00:30:23.001 --> 00:30:24.470
how much drilling you should do.

1299
00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:27.420
<v 1>You know,</v>

1300
00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:28.253
I just,

1301
00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:28.501
I let,

1302
00:30:28.501 --> 00:30:30.150
I let undressed Michael to handle that to me.

1303
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:31.021
He's,

1304
00:30:31.021 --> 00:30:31.351
he's,

1305
00:30:31.351 --> 00:30:31.621
he's a,

1306
00:30:31.621 --> 00:30:31.981
he's a,

1307
00:30:31.981 --> 00:30:32.820
he's a mastermind.

1308
00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:34.410
I'll coaching.

1309
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:35.903
He,

1310
00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:36.810
he,

1311
00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:40.230
he puts me in situations and off I hit him.

1312
00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.850
[inaudible] is the worst ever.

1313
00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:43.190
I'm thinking we'd be in a session.

1314
00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:46.710
We all have been fighting sometimes and I'll be like,

1315
00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:47.641
uh,

1316
00:30:47.641 --> 00:30:47.911
by,

1317
00:30:47.911 --> 00:30:49.890
it has this old mentality of training.

1318
00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:50.773
Uh,

1319
00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:51.680
he doesn't do,

1320
00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.120
we don't do too much of the scientific thing.

1321
00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:54.983
Like with,

1322
00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:55.501
you know,

1323
00:30:55.501 --> 00:30:56.630
you watch your poles,

1324
00:30:56.631 --> 00:30:56.811
your,

1325
00:30:56.811 --> 00:30:57.011
your,

1326
00:30:57.011 --> 00:30:57.521
your measure,

1327
00:30:57.521 --> 00:30:59.430
you think we just do the hardcore things.

1328
00:30:59.431 --> 00:31:02.130
And of course we do that to the scientific a little bit,

1329
00:31:02.131 --> 00:31:02.791
but not too much.

1330
00:31:02.791 --> 00:31:04.080
So we're trying to balancing out,

1331
00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:04.980
uh,

1332
00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:05.850
but just we,

1333
00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:06.601
yeah,

1334
00:31:06.601 --> 00:31:07.920
he plans everything out.

1335
00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:12.000
He's a mastermind of coaching and he knows me in and out and I know him.

1336
00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:15.580
<v 0>That's another very important part in the development of young fighters is</v>

1337
00:31:15.581 --> 00:31:18.980
having someone that they can entrust that has knowledge where it's an Eric del

1338
00:31:18.981 --> 00:31:20.810
Faro or Andreas or you know,

1339
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:22.090
Jackson Winkeljohn,

1340
00:31:22.091 --> 00:31:22.901
like whoever it is,

1341
00:31:22.901 --> 00:31:26.590
like having someone who really understands the sport,

1342
00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:27.760
who can guide you.

1343
00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:28.600
Yeah.

1344
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.910
And that's just such a giant resource for a guy.

1345
00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:31.910
<v 1>It is.</v>

1346
00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:32.743
And you know,

1347
00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:34.940
as this port explodes and get bigger,

1348
00:31:34.941 --> 00:31:39.140
you have those fake ones coming in and think they know everything,

1349
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:39.730
you know,

1350
00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:39.891
and,

1351
00:31:39.891 --> 00:31:40.061
and,

1352
00:31:40.061 --> 00:31:40.561
and they,

1353
00:31:40.561 --> 00:31:41.390
they wanted to be up.

1354
00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:42.850
They want to have piece of the cake basically.

1355
00:31:42.851 --> 00:31:43.510
Yeah.

1356
00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:47.810
While we have like these guys like Gary [inaudible] and undressed Michael and

1357
00:31:47.811 --> 00:31:48.644
their,

1358
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.571
their,

1359
00:31:49.571 --> 00:31:50.480
their masterminds man,

1360
00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:51.343
what is this,

1361
00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:52.520
what is his background?

1362
00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:54.410
He was a professional boxer.

1363
00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:55.980
Yeah.

1364
00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.740
Like he here's like 19 or 20,

1365
00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:59.780
no boxing record.

1366
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.621
So,

1367
00:32:00.621 --> 00:32:03.260
and then he broke his arm and he had to finish by,

1368
00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:04.870
has to finish Korea because he's here,

1369
00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:05.753
he's arm.

1370
00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:06.680
But uh,

1371
00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:07.161
now he's,

1372
00:32:07.161 --> 00:32:07.430
uh,

1373
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.791
he does,

1374
00:32:07.791 --> 00:32:11.400
he does his background and that's where I got my footwork from because you know,

1375
00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:12.590
that's what I'm got my,

1376
00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.470
my bay foundation in firing from.

1377
00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:16.641
And then,

1378
00:32:16.641 --> 00:32:17.474
um,

1379
00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:17.911
then I,

1380
00:32:17.911 --> 00:32:18.980
I also,

1381
00:32:18.981 --> 00:32:20.570
one thing about Bob bought a coach,

1382
00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:21.933
uh,

1383
00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.540
like [inaudible] for example,

1384
00:32:23.541 --> 00:32:24.820
he or Eric to there,

1385
00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:26.013
they don't,

1386
00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:27.530
they don't care about the glory.

1387
00:32:27.531 --> 00:32:28.910
They don't care about the attention,

1388
00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:29.181
you know,

1389
00:32:29.181 --> 00:32:29.261
they,

1390
00:32:29.261 --> 00:32:29.750
they,

1391
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:31.020
they don't care about the,

1392
00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:32.920
they are the head cultures by they,

1393
00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:33.800
they take in,

1394
00:32:33.801 --> 00:32:35.280
if they are honest to,

1395
00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:35.780
to,

1396
00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:37.510
to me and to themselves or not.

1397
00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:38.750
I don't know these things.

1398
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:39.580
I know the graph,

1399
00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:39.990
the graph

1400
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.311
<v 2>and things,</v>

1401
00:32:40.311 --> 00:32:40.671
I don't know.

1402
00:32:40.671 --> 00:32:45.320
The rest of the things they learn is they learn to as it as it grows and they

1403
00:32:45.321 --> 00:32:46.154
learn with me,

1404
00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:48.410
but they take in people that you know,

1405
00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:51.240
so that we cover the whole thing because what we've covered the whole,

1406
00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:52.133
the whole,

1407
00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:52.690
the whole,

1408
00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:54.320
all the aspects of the game basically.

1409
00:32:54.321 --> 00:32:54.891
So yeah,

1410
00:32:54.891 --> 00:32:57.770
Eric is one of the most important,

1411
00:32:57.771 --> 00:33:00.050
but yet the most humble guys.

1412
00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:00.261
Yeah.

1413
00:33:00.261 --> 00:33:02.780
He's super humble is very in the background.

1414
00:33:02.781 --> 00:33:04.580
There's a few guys like that that I really respect.

1415
00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:06.560
John Crouch from the MMA lab,

1416
00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:07.970
he's very similar to,

1417
00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:10.010
they're not looking for attention,

1418
00:33:10.011 --> 00:33:13.700
just laying back and there's a lot of guys that get that aren't looking for

1419
00:33:13.701 --> 00:33:15.500
attention that just get it because they're so good.

1420
00:33:15.501 --> 00:33:16.040
Like for us,

1421
00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.080
a hobby you can keep going on and on.

1422
00:33:18.081 --> 00:33:19.010
There's a lot of them,

1423
00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.620
but those guys are so important.

1424
00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:26.620
I mean it's so critical like finding a big camp with great fighters and a

1425
00:33:26.621 --> 00:33:28.880
fantastic coaching staff as well.

1426
00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:33.550
They're the difference between you realizing your full potential and not that

1427
00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:38.150
that's sometimes is the difference that's having the right coaches to keep

1428
00:33:38.151 --> 00:33:38.720
basically,

1429
00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:38.961
yes.

1430
00:33:38.961 --> 00:33:40.880
The Qi coaches and training partners?

1431
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:41.270
Yeah,

1432
00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:42.220
a hundred percent yeah.

1433
00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:43.220
Now,

1434
00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:44.000
so you,

1435
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.560
you give him like full reign in terms of like everything you do.

1436
00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.180
I would discuss it all the time.

1437
00:33:50.181 --> 00:33:52.870
We argue sometimes we were hugging sometimes.

1438
00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:53.061
You know,

1439
00:33:53.061 --> 00:33:53.600
it's,

1440
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.770
it's like a relationship man.

1441
00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:56.481
It's my,

1442
00:33:56.481 --> 00:33:56.721
it's my,

1443
00:33:56.721 --> 00:33:57.650
it's my family too.

1444
00:33:57.651 --> 00:33:58.484
So that's how you know,

1445
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.771
that's all it is.

1446
00:34:00.771 --> 00:34:01.970
I remember we had a,

1447
00:34:01.971 --> 00:34:02.930
we had a really good,

1448
00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.880
we were in Vegas actually for camp.

1449
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:06.010
I thought I was fine.

1450
00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:08.180
Kevin Silver and uh,

1451
00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:12.140
he was putting me in there in the cage with some big as real estate's.

1452
00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:13.340
I wasn't and I was,

1453
00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:15.620
I wasn't too far to 35 back then.

1454
00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:20.090
I was like two 2119 walking around with these guys was heavy,

1455
00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:22.610
big American heavyweights,

1456
00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.510
good wrestling guy.

1457
00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:25.250
And there was just taking me down and taking me down,

1458
00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.330
like submitting me and I was like a study.

1459
00:34:28.331 --> 00:34:29.200
I stand up in the case,

1460
00:34:29.201 --> 00:34:29.741
I'll throw all of them.

1461
00:34:29.741 --> 00:34:30.770
I think it's enough.

1462
00:34:30.771 --> 00:34:31.590
I can't take it,

1463
00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:32.330
let me out,

1464
00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:33.330
let me out of the case.

1465
00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:34.820
So I was hitting the door.

1466
00:34:34.821 --> 00:34:35.690
I wanted us to reject.

1467
00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:37.640
The Gym was full of people now,

1468
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:39.570
so everybody just froze looking at me like,

1469
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:42.590
and the case was like on a pedestal so everybody could see me.

1470
00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:48.030
So I was hitting the door and I see on reality is outside of the,

1471
00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:49.970
he's like doing this dope.

1472
00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:52.410
He's standing there while I'm moron,

1473
00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:54.740
yelling so blows through.

1474
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:55.791
Meanwhile,

1475
00:34:55.791 --> 00:34:57.890
when you took John Jones down,

1476
00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.510
you had to be thinking,

1477
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:01.970
God damn glad I didn't open up that door.

1478
00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:06.210
I was surprised from that.

1479
00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:07.880
When I ended up in that position on top of him,

1480
00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:09.980
like Shamir Shit out of me,

1481
00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:11.450
the this really happened.

1482
00:35:11.451 --> 00:35:12.940
I didn't think you were going to go for it.

1483
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:15.430
So when you went for it and then took him down,

1484
00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:15.920
we were all like,

1485
00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.630
oh shit.

1486
00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:18.830
I was shocked.

1487
00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:19.041
I was.

1488
00:35:19.041 --> 00:35:20.270
I was laying on top and I'm like,

1489
00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:20.990
wow,

1490
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.361
I have,

1491
00:35:21.361 --> 00:35:22.194
I'm an extra on top.

1492
00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:23.770
I'm a top of this guy.

1493
00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:25.850
I didn't even think that was possible,

1494
00:35:25.851 --> 00:35:27.860
but it wasn't that too hard to take.

1495
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:30.490
I think Darlene caught them by surprise.

1496
00:35:30.491 --> 00:35:30.561
Yeah,

1497
00:35:30.561 --> 00:35:30.891
I did.

1498
00:35:30.891 --> 00:35:31.340
I was,

1499
00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:32.031
it was pretty awesome.

1500
00:35:32.031 --> 00:35:33.080
I think it was a price to,

1501
00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:34.040
yeah.

1502
00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:34.490
Yeah.

1503
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:36.500
Well it was a pretty fucking awesome.

1504
00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:37.980
Now what does a

1505
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.050
<v 0>typical day in your,</v>

1506
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:40.470
uh,

1507
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:41.161
in your camp?

1508
00:35:41.161 --> 00:35:41.850
Like do you,

1509
00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:45.120
do you break up conditioning days with skill work days?

1510
00:35:45.121 --> 00:35:46.470
Do you do conditioning in the morning?

1511
00:35:46.471 --> 00:35:48.510
Do you do it in after you're done where your skill work?

1512
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:49.463
How do you work that?

1513
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:51.550
I do,

1514
00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:52.200
I do,

1515
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:52.810
I do

1516
00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:55.360
<v 1>from 10 to 12 sessions a week on when I'm in camp,</v>

1517
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:56.111
I tried to,

1518
00:35:56.111 --> 00:35:56.501
we have,

1519
00:35:56.501 --> 00:35:57.580
we have actually the,

1520
00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:01.960
the group that we had the group workouts with the whole group,

1521
00:36:01.961 --> 00:36:02.800
the holiday wreath group,

1522
00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:03.663
uh,

1523
00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:04.120
uh,

1524
00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:08.710
in the mornings and then we do everything from sparring too,

1525
00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:09.550
too.

1526
00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:11.350
Good kickboxing grills too.

1527
00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:11.561
Yeah,

1528
00:36:11.561 --> 00:36:12.394
whatever.

1529
00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:13.271
That's when the group is,

1530
00:36:13.271 --> 00:36:14.160
is training and that's,

1531
00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:16.000
that's it's all the time.

1532
00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:18.490
It's the same group at the same time every morning.

1533
00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:20.470
And then the nighttime is more like individual,

1534
00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:21.371
okay,

1535
00:36:21.371 --> 00:36:22.430
what I'm doing today.

1536
00:36:22.431 --> 00:36:22.551
Yeah.

1537
00:36:22.551 --> 00:36:23.420
You'd maybe do five,

1538
00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:28.060
five rounds of pants and they need to do sprints or it could be either one or

1539
00:36:28.061 --> 00:36:28.990
strength or,

1540
00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:30.250
yeah,

1541
00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:31.031
it could be the one.

1542
00:36:31.031 --> 00:36:31.900
So that's how we,

1543
00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:32.710
that's how we,

1544
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:33.760
how we do it basically.

1545
00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:36.300
<v 0>So do you have a separate Jujitsu coach?</v>

1546
00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:37.700
Separate Moy Thai coach?

1547
00:36:37.701 --> 00:36:38.390
Like how do you,

1548
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:39.680
how do you work all that stuff out?

1549
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:40.040
Yeah,

1550
00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:41.150
the guy that was with me now,

1551
00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:42.740
<v 1>the Joakim Karlsson,</v>

1552
00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:44.000
he's actually the,

1553
00:36:44.001 --> 00:36:44.510
the,

1554
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:46.040
the national,

1555
00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:46.441
uh,

1556
00:36:46.441 --> 00:36:47.990
the national coast of Thai boxing.

1557
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:49.690
And he's coaching me in,

1558
00:36:49.691 --> 00:36:49.951
in my,

1559
00:36:49.951 --> 00:36:50.331
in my,

1560
00:36:50.331 --> 00:36:51.740
in my cakes and my niece and my,

1561
00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:52.791
in my,

1562
00:36:52.791 --> 00:36:53.601
in my kickbox.

1563
00:36:53.601 --> 00:36:53.950
And then I,

1564
00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:55.620
I learn Nascimento.

1565
00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:56.780
It's a Brazilian,

1566
00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:58.311
he lives in.

1567
00:36:58.311 --> 00:37:01.190
I'd been living in Sweden many years and as a family and everything.

1568
00:37:01.191 --> 00:37:02.570
So he's having,

1569
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:06.380
he asked my Jujitsu and my grappling and he is such a competitive guy.

1570
00:37:06.381 --> 00:37:07.214
He's still,

1571
00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.540
he's still competes.

1572
00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:10.490
It beats me up in e sports with me,

1573
00:37:10.491 --> 00:37:11.390
basically like a,

1574
00:37:11.391 --> 00:37:12.141
his spouse with me.

1575
00:37:12.141 --> 00:37:12.974
And it just,

1576
00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:14.660
it makes me learn the hard way.

1577
00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:17.270
So you've got just done an amazing staff over there.

1578
00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.133
Amazing stuff.

1579
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:19.070
It's amazing stuff.

1580
00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:20.450
That's fantastic.

1581
00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.240
I love it.

1582
00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:24.090
<v 0>And so when you say you do these 10 to 12 sessions per week,</v>

1583
00:37:24.091 --> 00:37:25.700
do you have like a,

1584
00:37:25.701 --> 00:37:27.290
a board up on the wall?

1585
00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:30.930
You outlined the week ahead or do you do it day by day?

1586
00:37:30.931 --> 00:37:31.750
How do you do that?

1587
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:32.870
I'll get a text from Andreas.

1588
00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:35.610
This is the way I just,

1589
00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:38.700
I just awaiting from that takes math but the Silas and fuck up my phone.

1590
00:37:38.701 --> 00:37:39.720
Like I don't want to see it,

1591
00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:42.190
but I have to know so,

1592
00:37:42.191 --> 00:37:42.541
so,

1593
00:37:42.541 --> 00:37:43.910
so that's how it works.

1594
00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:44.320
They give me

1595
00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.153
<v 1>text.</v>

1596
00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:45.740
If,

1597
00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:49.210
if we do it could be on the board to have a big wipe board on the,

1598
00:37:49.211 --> 00:37:49.391
on the,

1599
00:37:49.391 --> 00:37:49.661
on the,

1600
00:37:49.661 --> 00:37:50.321
on the wall.

1601
00:37:50.321 --> 00:37:51.340
He could be on the world too.

1602
00:37:51.341 --> 00:37:52.630
He puts down the session.

1603
00:37:52.631 --> 00:37:53.860
If it's something's particularly,

1604
00:37:53.861 --> 00:37:57.400
we are maybe sparring commoning we have to adapt the schedule a little bit

1605
00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:58.953
different.

1606
00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.060
It's a different one every week.

1607
00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:01.983
So

1608
00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:02.661
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1609
00:38:02.661 --> 00:38:03.411
I could imagine.

1610
00:38:03.411 --> 00:38:04.520
I would imagine it gets,

1611
00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:05.810
I used to training.

1612
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.230
Yeah,

1613
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:07.063
still train.

1614
00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:10.730
I've got some serious injuries and I'm trying to heal up right now though.

1615
00:38:10.731 --> 00:38:12.140
It was dangerous to,

1616
00:38:12.141 --> 00:38:12.650
uh,

1617
00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:13.483
problems.

1618
00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:13.791
Uh,

1619
00:38:13.791 --> 00:38:16.940
one big one is I got tendinitis in my elbow.

1620
00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.090
I've never had tendinitis before and don't know what that is.

1621
00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:25.410
It's fucking strain and the tendon that just does if you tendance of low blood

1622
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:26.503
supply.

1623
00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:29.240
So the problem with tendinitis is it takes forever to heal.

1624
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:31.280
And I didn't overstretch the alarm.

1625
00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:34.830
It was a from pulling from cleans and from Chin.

1626
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.110
<v 2>This one on the inside this,</v>

1627
00:38:38.111 --> 00:38:40.120
this muscle right here or this tendon right here.

1628
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:41.290
Man,

1629
00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:42.101
I fucked it up.

1630
00:38:42.101 --> 00:38:42.520
I just,

1631
00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:43.720
I kept training with it.

1632
00:38:43.721 --> 00:38:48.160
I kept getting information in a real bad to the point where it wasn't healing

1633
00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:50.740
and I did stem cells and PRP.

1634
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:52.360
I finally got ahold of it,

1635
00:38:52.361 --> 00:38:53.800
but it's this thing right here.

1636
00:38:53.801 --> 00:38:55.000
I keep it with me all the time.

1637
00:38:55.001 --> 00:38:56.650
This helped me more than anything.

1638
00:38:56.651 --> 00:39:00.220
It's a thing called the theraband and what you do is you hold it because it's

1639
00:39:00.221 --> 00:39:00.460
on,

1640
00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:01.840
this is the elbow that's injured.

1641
00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.610
So I hold it out like this,

1642
00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:08.820
I twist it and then I slowly untwisted with this side and that therapy,

1643
00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:09.791
just doing this,

1644
00:39:09.791 --> 00:39:10.870
I do this like five,

1645
00:39:10.871 --> 00:39:11.651
six times a day.

1646
00:39:11.651 --> 00:39:12.700
I'll do like 10 reps.

1647
00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.640
That's been like the best thing that's helped me more than anything.

1648
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:18.110
Will you be able to trend now or new?

1649
00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:19.750
You'll be soon.

1650
00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:20.950
Pretty soon.

1651
00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:22.630
I think I'm good.

1652
00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:23.890
In about two weeks.

1653
00:39:23.891 --> 00:39:26.190
I'm going to give myself two more weeks as kicks.

1654
00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:26.500
Oh,

1655
00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:27.100
thank you.

1656
00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:27.970
That's what I heard.

1657
00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:29.680
I'll show you.

1658
00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:30.550
I can still kick,

1659
00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:32.330
but now I have no problem with my kid.

1660
00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:33.191
Yeah,

1661
00:39:33.191 --> 00:39:34.024
I'm very public.

1662
00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:34.900
Cool.

1663
00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:35.260
Cool.

1664
00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:36.760
I did taekwondo when I was a little kid.

1665
00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:38.980
I started out with that and then you know,

1666
00:39:38.981 --> 00:39:40.120
got into Moitai later,

1667
00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:41.373
but yeah.

1668
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:42.503
Cool.

1669
00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:44.241
I have to,

1670
00:39:44.241 --> 00:39:46.090
I have to strike for an hour before the workouts.

1671
00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:46.680
Really?

1672
00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:47.050
Yeah.

1673
00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:47.560
I think it's,

1674
00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:48.070
I don't know.

1675
00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:50.260
I think it's from my genetics or something.

1676
00:39:50.261 --> 00:39:52.420
I'm just a stiff vikings.

1677
00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:53.830
I'm telling Aaron Swartz,

1678
00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:54.683
swinging Swartz,

1679
00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:55.910
kick over your knees.

1680
00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:58.740
I can only move fast pretty much.

1681
00:39:58.920 --> 00:39:59.620
That's all.

1682
00:39:59.620 --> 00:39:59.861
Yeah,

1683
00:39:59.861 --> 00:40:02.200
but I guarantee you you could improve that flexibility.

1684
00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:05.141
That's the thing.

1685
00:40:05.141 --> 00:40:07.180
I have that through my whole career.

1686
00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:07.970
I was just working on my,

1687
00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:10.330
my flexibility and I went out.

1688
00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:10.960
When I'm,

1689
00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.280
when I'm stepping in that Octagon,

1690
00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:13.540
I'm flexible as hell.

1691
00:40:13.541 --> 00:40:15.010
But that's just two times a year ago.

1692
00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:15.993
So

1693
00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.500
full peak in the full peak of camp and you're flexing this,

1694
00:40:20.501 --> 00:40:21.380
I leave the cases.

1695
00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:25.420
Are you doing a lot of weightlifting?

1696
00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:26.410
Is that what it is?

1697
00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.440
You're doing lot of squats or dead lifts?

1698
00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:31.120
It seemed like they're negative because I think I just,

1699
00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:31.970
I'm,

1700
00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:32.590
I'm,

1701
00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:33.500
I'm super stoked.

1702
00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.870
It depends on not stiff everywhere.

1703
00:40:34.871 --> 00:40:35.201
He's just,

1704
00:40:35.201 --> 00:40:36.370
my hamstrings are stiff.

1705
00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:37.720
When did you start martial arts?

1706
00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:39.093
Uh,

1707
00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:43.060
for real when I was starting him in May,

1708
00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:45.010
2000 end of 2006 really?

1709
00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:45.461
Okay.

1710
00:40:45.461 --> 00:40:47.230
So it was fairly late in life.

1711
00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:47.651
It was,

1712
00:40:47.651 --> 00:40:48.700
I've been boxing and stuff,

1713
00:40:48.701 --> 00:40:49.990
but that's just being an amateur level.

1714
00:40:49.991 --> 00:40:51.280
I don't even count that as a,

1715
00:40:51.281 --> 00:40:52.114
as a,

1716
00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:54.760
as a series doing sport thing.

1717
00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:56.590
It was just fucking around.

1718
00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:57.220
Yeah,

1719
00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:57.800
just be painting.

1720
00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.290
So you were basically like 18,

1721
00:40:59.291 --> 00:41:01.150
19 when you really got into it around there.

1722
00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:01.720
Yeah.

1723
00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.250
So your body already matured.

1724
00:41:03.251 --> 00:41:07.870
See One of the things that you see about kicking in particular is when you get

1725
00:41:07.871 --> 00:41:10.180
young fighters before their bodies matured,

1726
00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:13.180
then their flexibility usually stays.

1727
00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:14.020
You know,

1728
00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:15.910
like if you start karate or something like that.

1729
00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.260
Could Phil Davis for example,

1730
00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:17.681
that guy,

1731
00:41:17.681 --> 00:41:18.371
he's massive.

1732
00:41:18.371 --> 00:41:21.460
Bastille is flexible as it's great.

1733
00:41:21.461 --> 00:41:23.250
It's like a fucking stud out too.

1734
00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.420
He looks like Superhero.

1735
00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:24.880
I know.

1736
00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:27.400
Like he limited his waist to shoulder ratio.

1737
00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:28.531
It same with Jim.

1738
00:41:28.531 --> 00:41:29.700
Even though Jim and Manuel,

1739
00:41:29.701 --> 00:41:31.390
I don't put up my teacher when I'm training with him.

1740
00:41:31.391 --> 00:41:33.710
I don't want to just get hoodie on me.

1741
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.880
It's keeping my hoodie on.

1742
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:37.530
Say with the field guys are jacked.

1743
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:38.120
Yeah,

1744
00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:38.630
I know.

1745
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:39.650
Even if they're off season,

1746
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:40.730
that's the thing.

1747
00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:43.130
I just get him Chubby or like a big,

1748
00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:47.730
big s the former body and these guys,

1749
00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:48.650
they're like,

1750
00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:49.760
it looks like athletes all round.

1751
00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:50.660
Man.

1752
00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:51.560
Is that frustrating?

1753
00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:52.693
Sometimes,

1754
00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:55.740
but it's that just genetic of though when I went into the wrong

1755
00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:58.190
fat guy,

1756
00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:59.450
fat guys all over the world.

1757
00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:00.613
Yeah.

1758
00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:01.610
Um,

1759
00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:02.443
so do you,

1760
00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:03.260
do you like,

1761
00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:05.840
do you watch your diet at all outside of a camp?

1762
00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:07.250
I do.

1763
00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:08.360
I do actually I do.

1764
00:42:08.361 --> 00:42:09.141
I tried to,

1765
00:42:09.141 --> 00:42:10.370
I tried to stay away from sugar,

1766
00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:11.361
sugar.

1767
00:42:11.361 --> 00:42:11.601
I don't,

1768
00:42:11.601 --> 00:42:12.434
I don't,

1769
00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:14.113
uh,

1770
00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:15.410
when I do sugar,

1771
00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:17.420
if I do like sodas and stuff like that,

1772
00:42:17.421 --> 00:42:18.201
eye candy,

1773
00:42:18.201 --> 00:42:18.700
whatever,

1774
00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:18.890
I,

1775
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:20.000
I gain a lot of weight.

1776
00:42:20.001 --> 00:42:20.840
But as soon as I quit it,

1777
00:42:20.841 --> 00:42:23.360
I just crazy as I drop in weight,

1778
00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:24.320
sugar is the devil.

1779
00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:25.190
It is.

1780
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:26.023
I hate children.

1781
00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:26.970
That's the worst.

1782
00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:30.260
It's the worst when you realize what it's actually doing to your body and you

1783
00:42:30.261 --> 00:42:31.280
realize it's everywhere.

1784
00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:34.550
And that most people that you run into are just eating sugar all day long and

1785
00:42:34.551 --> 00:42:35.091
it's crashing.

1786
00:42:35.091 --> 00:42:37.130
Doesn't taste that good if you don't do it right.

1787
00:42:37.131 --> 00:42:37.970
That's the weird thing,

1788
00:42:37.971 --> 00:42:38.270
right?

1789
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:39.410
Once your gut bacteria,

1790
00:42:39.411 --> 00:42:41.510
because acclimated to eating healthy food,

1791
00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:43.310
you start craving salads and shit.

1792
00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:43.730
Yeah.

1793
00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:44.241
It's weird,

1794
00:42:44.241 --> 00:42:44.391
right?

1795
00:42:44.391 --> 00:42:45.150
Yeah.

1796
00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:47.330
So now when you talk about flexibility,

1797
00:42:47.331 --> 00:42:48.290
do you ever do yoga?

1798
00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:49.460
I don't.

1799
00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:50.151
You don't know?

1800
00:42:50.151 --> 00:42:50.984
I don't like that

1801
00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:54.470
Vikings in Yoga don't mix.

1802
00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:56.010
No.

1803
00:42:56.010 --> 00:42:56.600
I,

1804
00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.280
I think it just because I'm so bad at it.

1805
00:42:58.281 --> 00:42:58.880
Um,

1806
00:42:58.880 --> 00:42:59.260
you know,

1807
00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:00.590
and you need patient,

1808
00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:02.280
a lot of patients doing it.

1809
00:43:02.281 --> 00:43:03.500
And I wish,

1810
00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:04.880
I wish I liked it.

1811
00:43:04.881 --> 00:43:05.330
I wish I,

1812
00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:06.041
because I would probably,

1813
00:43:06.041 --> 00:43:07.310
I would probably needed more than ever,

1814
00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:08.630
but he's still,

1815
00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:10.340
it don't get me wrong.

1816
00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:10.690
Um,

1817
00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:11.190
uh,

1818
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:11.540
you know,

1819
00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:12.530
I stretch,

1820
00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:15.830
I do my flexible things in my training and all that,

1821
00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:17.100
but yeah,

1822
00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:19.100
I put a whole workout in just to,

1823
00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:21.410
just to stretch your body.

1824
00:43:21.490 --> 00:43:21.850
Um,

1825
00:43:21.850 --> 00:43:22.420
I dunno.

1826
00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:23.540
I don't have the patience for it.

1827
00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:24.830
It's not just that though.

1828
00:43:24.831 --> 00:43:26.090
That's what's interesting about it.

1829
00:43:26.091 --> 00:43:27.440
It's a strengthening thing too.

1830
00:43:27.441 --> 00:43:29.570
Just strengthens your body in an unusual way.

1831
00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:30.640
Um,

1832
00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:34.820
I've seen a lot more fighters getting involved in it and really seeing benefits.

1833
00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:36.980
One of them was a Nathan Corbett,

1834
00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:37.880
you know Nathan Corbett,

1835
00:43:37.881 --> 00:43:38.930
the mortar champion.

1836
00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:39.671
Yeah,

1837
00:43:39.671 --> 00:43:40.430
I heard along.

1838
00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:43.250
He's doing some interview recently and talking about how much yoga he does and

1839
00:43:43.251 --> 00:43:45.350
how much it's helped his power and helped this movement.

1840
00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:45.561
No,

1841
00:43:45.561 --> 00:43:46.640
I believe it does.

1842
00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:47.533
I believe it does.

1843
00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:48.110
Based on that.

1844
00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:51.740
Interested probably have to think about it.

1845
00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:53.661
What I was thinking,

1846
00:43:53.661 --> 00:43:54.590
God like you,

1847
00:43:54.591 --> 00:43:59.420
who's so driven and trying to succeed at all costs,

1848
00:43:59.421 --> 00:44:02.000
like trying to figure out what's the best way to succeed.

1849
00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:03.590
You might want to investigate that.

1850
00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:04.191
I should,

1851
00:44:04.191 --> 00:44:05.060
I should actually do it.

1852
00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:06.133
I should do it.

1853
00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:06.950
I think it will.

1854
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:07.783
I think I will,

1855
00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:09.353
you know,

1856
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:10.220
people telling me,

1857
00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:10.480
you know,

1858
00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:11.840
they telling me like my cakes,

1859
00:44:11.841 --> 00:44:13.140
I have to work on my case more.

1860
00:44:13.141 --> 00:44:14.390
You have to use my kicks more than fights.

1861
00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:15.440
They all right.

1862
00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:16.910
I need to start doing my kicks.

1863
00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:17.930
Mourn the thing.

1864
00:44:17.931 --> 00:44:19.340
I kick butt.

1865
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:22.190
I kicked with a soda and maybe uh,

1866
00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:23.360
unsecurity I dunno.

1867
00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:25.220
I I love,

1868
00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:26.120
I love,

1869
00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:27.220
I think it is from,

1870
00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:30.360
from back in the days when I was getting taken down all the time doing my kicks.

1871
00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:31.673
But

1872
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.960
<v 1>nowadays people taking me down,</v>

1873
00:44:33.961 --> 00:44:34.310
but um,

1874
00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:34.740
you know,

1875
00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:35.580
they can't hold me down.

1876
00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:37.080
Nobody if to take me down,

1877
00:44:37.081 --> 00:44:37.914
nobody can hold me down.

1878
00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:41.250
So this is something I need to like start doing even more,

1879
00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:42.540
not just kick into the,

1880
00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:43.440
to the legs are,

1881
00:44:43.441 --> 00:44:43.830
you know,

1882
00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:45.480
more powerful kicks to the body.

1883
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:46.783
My knees are good.

1884
00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:48.870
I worked on my niece all the time and I'm,

1885
00:44:48.871 --> 00:44:49.071
I'm,

1886
00:44:49.071 --> 00:44:52.150
I'm putting in more in my fights and allow needs.

1887
00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:53.120
Um,

1888
00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:53.400
I'm,

1889
00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:55.740
I'm getting really high with my niece was fine.

1890
00:44:55.860 --> 00:45:00.240
You'd have chains about MMA and martial arts in general is that there's always

1891
00:45:00.241 --> 00:45:01.350
room for improvement.

1892
00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:02.760
There's always things to work on.

1893
00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:04.230
No one is the best at everything.

1894
00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:05.490
Even if you are 31 years old,

1895
00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:07.230
you're doing this for 10 years,

1896
00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:08.430
you still have so much to learn.

1897
00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:09.560
That's the,

1898
00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:10.650
that's the good thing with the sport.

1899
00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:11.161
No,

1900
00:45:11.161 --> 00:45:11.421
it's a,

1901
00:45:11.421 --> 00:45:13.050
it's such a comprehensive sport.

1902
00:45:13.051 --> 00:45:13.261
I mean,

1903
00:45:13.261 --> 00:45:17.250
I really don't think people appreciate how much thought is involved in the

1904
00:45:17.251 --> 00:45:18.084
preparation.

1905
00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:18.870
Yeah,

1906
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:19.051
no,

1907
00:45:19.051 --> 00:45:19.440
it's,

1908
00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:20.010
it's a lot.

1909
00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:20.843
It's a lot.

1910
00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:21.983
It's a lot.

1911
00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:24.630
So how long do you think you'll be doing it?

1912
00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:28.080
You say 31 like you're old,

1913
00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:29.203
you're not,

1914
00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:32.160
it seems like you've been doing it a long time,

1915
00:45:32.161 --> 00:45:32.490
right?

1916
00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:32.910
Yeah.

1917
00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:34.380
How many years do you think you have left?

1918
00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:37.293
I,

1919
00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.810
I feel I feel really hungry and motivated.

1920
00:45:40.830 --> 00:45:42.890
I don't think the age is going to be I,

1921
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:43.260
I don't,

1922
00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:44.011
I don't think,

1923
00:45:44.011 --> 00:45:44.844
uh,

1924
00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:46.950
my age in terms of,

1925
00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:48.180
you know,

1926
00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:49.680
have pain in your body or injuries,

1927
00:45:49.681 --> 00:45:50.970
anything like that is going to stop me.

1928
00:45:50.971 --> 00:45:51.570
It's more like,

1929
00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:52.920
as long as I'm having fun,

1930
00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:55.140
as long as I'm enjoying what I'm doing,

1931
00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:56.853
I'll do it.

1932
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:57.810
I'll do it.

1933
00:45:57.810 --> 00:45:58.280
You'll have,

1934
00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:01.790
you have guys that are like doing it late in to,

1935
00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:04.320
that's also a good thing with the sport.

1936
00:46:04.321 --> 00:46:06.000
It's such a guy,

1937
00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:08.400
such an old age of,

1938
00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:08.691
of,

1939
00:46:08.691 --> 00:46:11.820
of peaking if you compare it to other sports.

1940
00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:13.280
So I have,

1941
00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:14.330
I have a lot more to gain.

1942
00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:15.270
I can't give you a number,

1943
00:46:15.271 --> 00:46:16.860
but I have a lot more to give.

1944
00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:17.631
Filling.

1945
00:46:17.631 --> 00:46:19.230
You've had moments in your career though,

1946
00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:20.580
you were kind of down,

1947
00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:21.050
right?

1948
00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:24.750
Like how much longer am I going to do this exactly.

1949
00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:25.430
Now?

1950
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:27.100
[inaudible] Anthony Johnson loss that,

1951
00:46:27.110 --> 00:46:28.020
that was a tough one.

1952
00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:29.433
Uh,

1953
00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:31.170
you know,

1954
00:46:31.170 --> 00:46:31.650
uh,

1955
00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:31.921
but,

1956
00:46:31.921 --> 00:46:34.050
but I always told myself like,

1957
00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:34.651
you know,

1958
00:46:34.651 --> 00:46:35.484
either either,

1959
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:37.830
either I just put my,

1960
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.950
either I just get the fuck out of there.

1961
00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:43.040
I'd just learn from it and keep going.

1962
00:46:43.041 --> 00:46:45.150
And doing it then I just love my life as it is.

1963
00:46:45.151 --> 00:46:45.421
You know,

1964
00:46:45.421 --> 00:46:46.230
I had the,

1965
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:46.680
I had my,

1966
00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:47.120
my,

1967
00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:47.953
my,

1968
00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:48.320
uh,

1969
00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:49.960
I'm so flexible in my schedule and my,

1970
00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:50.380
my,

1971
00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:50.670
you know,

1972
00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:53.550
I'm in my time with the family and again,

1973
00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:54.570
everything from the sport,

1974
00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:55.410
so,

1975
00:46:55.410 --> 00:46:59.760
so I have to do it more and I'm going to do it more.

1976
00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:00.020
That's,

1977
00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:00.870
that's what I,

1978
00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:01.610
if I,

1979
00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:02.930
if I probably gonna like if,

1980
00:47:02.931 --> 00:47:04.110
if I would like for example,

1981
00:47:04.111 --> 00:47:04.710
say,

1982
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:05.190
you know,

1983
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:05.551
fuck it,

1984
00:47:05.551 --> 00:47:06.290
I don't have,

1985
00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:07.920
after I lost against antique for example,

1986
00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:12.630
I would regret myself like a lot,

1987
00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:17.120
like in the lake forest maybe don't so well because you,

1988
00:47:17.121 --> 00:47:19.140
you had your finest performance after that.

1989
00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:19.600
Yeah,

1990
00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:24.060
I mean the Glover to sharer and I just feel like that's the thing and I just

1991
00:47:24.061 --> 00:47:25.770
feel like I'm just keep going like this,

1992
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:26.491
right.

1993
00:47:26.491 --> 00:47:27.041
For every fight.

1994
00:47:27.041 --> 00:47:27.631
And then I have,

1995
00:47:27.631 --> 00:47:28.800
I have just a couple of setbacks,

1996
00:47:28.801 --> 00:47:31.030
but I'm seeing those marginals.

1997
00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:32.590
I see the numbers gone up.

1998
00:47:32.591 --> 00:47:32.951
I see.

1999
00:47:32.951 --> 00:47:34.360
I see myself doing better.

2000
00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:39.930
So I believe in myself 100% and I believe I have what it takes to take that belt

2001
00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:42.160
that I believe I have what it takes.

2002
00:47:42.161 --> 00:47:44.830
And I believe I can beat John John's,

2003
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:46.720
I believe 100%.

2004
00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:50.830
I have what it takes to beat John Jones and I have what it takes to be DC.

2005
00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:54.070
So I'm just looking for that opportunity.

2006
00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:55.030
I want to,

2007
00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:55.271
you know,

2008
00:47:55.271 --> 00:47:56.104
step in there.

2009
00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:57.880
People will say I'm not the active enough.

2010
00:47:57.881 --> 00:47:58.001
I,

2011
00:47:58.001 --> 00:47:58.900
I don't say enough,

2012
00:47:58.901 --> 00:48:00.220
but that's never been my thing.

2013
00:48:00.221 --> 00:48:02.200
I know there'd been like a condom or Greg or,

2014
00:48:02.201 --> 00:48:03.680
and if I should start doing what he's doing,

2015
00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:04.511
people are going to tell me like,

2016
00:48:04.511 --> 00:48:05.344
shut the fuck up.

2017
00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:06.230
You know,

2018
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.671
I see.

2019
00:48:06.671 --> 00:48:07.151
Right through you.

2020
00:48:07.151 --> 00:48:07.984
You're not that guy.

2021
00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:09.970
I was just like silly myself.

2022
00:48:09.971 --> 00:48:10.241
So,

2023
00:48:10.241 --> 00:48:10.750
yeah.

2024
00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:11.770
So I just,

2025
00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:12.011
you know,

2026
00:48:12.011 --> 00:48:14.110
doing what I do and I was just going to do what I do and,

2027
00:48:14.111 --> 00:48:15.250
and uh,

2028
00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:16.870
and I show what I have when I,

2029
00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:21.040
when I fight and I've been a little bit inactive because of we've got some my

2030
00:48:21.041 --> 00:48:22.750
injury now and because of all that,

2031
00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:23.580
but you know,

2032
00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:24.401
whatever people say,

2033
00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:28.750
I'm and I'm done and I'm just waiting for the next opportunity basically.

2034
00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:30.100
I can't weight the rumble.

2035
00:48:30.101 --> 00:48:33.730
Johnson fight was a tough one for you to swallow too because it was in

2036
00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:34.570
Stockholm.

2037
00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:36.250
It was this enormous event.

2038
00:48:36.251 --> 00:48:37.630
Everybody was there to see you.

2039
00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:40.360
And I'm in that fight.

2040
00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:42.580
We didn't pick it up while the fight was going on,

2041
00:48:42.581 --> 00:48:44.110
but you guys collided heads.

2042
00:48:44.111 --> 00:48:44.710
Yeah.

2043
00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:44.861
Yeah.

2044
00:48:44.861 --> 00:48:45.694
It was a headbutt.

2045
00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:46.450
Yeah,

2046
00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:46.781
I'm not,

2047
00:48:46.781 --> 00:48:50.500
I'm not taking anything away from Anthony Johnson hit that guy is a beast and he

2048
00:48:50.501 --> 00:48:51.220
hits a hot,

2049
00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:54.400
he's one of the hardest hit her in the fucking sport.

2050
00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:54.940
No,

2051
00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:55.121
I mean,

2052
00:48:55.121 --> 00:48:56.320
no one's taking anything away from him.

2053
00:48:56.321 --> 00:48:57.760
He's truly exceptional.

2054
00:48:57.790 --> 00:48:58.331
But the thing is,

2055
00:48:58.331 --> 00:48:59.010
I would throwing my,

2056
00:48:59.010 --> 00:48:59.390
my,

2057
00:48:59.390 --> 00:48:59.611
my,

2058
00:48:59.611 --> 00:49:04.611
my kick there and he just came in there and he's forehead hit my chin.

2059
00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:06.963
Yeah.

2060
00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:07.931
And from an,

2061
00:49:07.931 --> 00:49:08.470
I just,

2062
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:09.910
I just blacked out.

2063
00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:10.660
I didn't,

2064
00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:11.441
I went down,

2065
00:49:11.441 --> 00:49:12.161
I went up again.

2066
00:49:12.161 --> 00:49:12.880
I was in the Ma,

2067
00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.880
I was in the match again bunny.

2068
00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:15.490
He just,

2069
00:49:15.490 --> 00:49:15.791
you know,

2070
00:49:15.791 --> 00:49:17.140
when you get a taste of blood,

2071
00:49:17.141 --> 00:49:17.920
he just goes for it.

2072
00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:19.870
And I should just keep my guard up.

2073
00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:21.160
I'm very like this,

2074
00:49:21.310 --> 00:49:21.850
right.

2075
00:49:21.850 --> 00:49:25.210
And I'm very lengthy and he just caught me as I'm doing all that.

2076
00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:29.660
But isn't that one of those situations where until you've been there and you,

2077
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:32.620
you been that hurt in a big fight like that.

2078
00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:34.590
It's like the experiences,

2079
00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:36.610
it's an alien experience.

2080
00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:37.120
It is.

2081
00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:37.690
It is.

2082
00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:37.931
It's,

2083
00:49:37.931 --> 00:49:38.171
it's,

2084
00:49:38.171 --> 00:49:40.000
you don't recognize any of the of it.

2085
00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:42.400
It's like you can't,

2086
00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:46.030
nothing controls your mind trying to control your legs,

2087
00:49:46.031 --> 00:49:47.590
your arms like this and that.

2088
00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:48.940
But it was just,

2089
00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:54.060
I was just disoriented and then there was four in the morning in one of the big

2090
00:49:54.461 --> 00:49:55.570
stadium in Sweden,

2091
00:49:55.571 --> 00:49:56.260
four in the morning.

2092
00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:57.093
We filled it up,

2093
00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:59.380
we fill it up and it's huge.

2094
00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:00.731
It was huge,

2095
00:50:00.731 --> 00:50:00.971
man.

2096
00:50:00.971 --> 00:50:01.101
And,

2097
00:50:01.101 --> 00:50:01.331
and,

2098
00:50:01.331 --> 00:50:01.781
and,

2099
00:50:01.781 --> 00:50:02.614
uh,

2100
00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:03.880
and like I said,

2101
00:50:03.881 --> 00:50:04.571
four in the morning,

2102
00:50:04.571 --> 00:50:04.961
I do,

2103
00:50:04.961 --> 00:50:05.201
you know,

2104
00:50:05.201 --> 00:50:06.220
when the people told me like,

2105
00:50:06.250 --> 00:50:06.371
oh,

2106
00:50:06.371 --> 00:50:06.941
are we going to do this?

2107
00:50:06.941 --> 00:50:07.241
I'm like,

2108
00:50:07.241 --> 00:50:07.501
no,

2109
00:50:07.501 --> 00:50:08.080
he's not gonna.

2110
00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:08.950
It's not gonna happen.

2111
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:11.110
How should we manage to fill this place up?

2112
00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:11.710
Right.

2113
00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:13.810
But still people went there to see it.

2114
00:50:13.811 --> 00:50:15.790
Then it was just amazing feeling of stepping out there.

2115
00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:16.061
Well,

2116
00:50:16.061 --> 00:50:17.680
for people that don't understand why they did it,

2117
00:50:17.681 --> 00:50:19.540
to coordinate it with American paper view.

2118
00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:19.721
Yeah,

2119
00:50:19.721 --> 00:50:20.380
exactly.

2120
00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:21.110
Exactly.

2121
00:50:21.110 --> 00:50:21.943
Uh,

2122
00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:23.590
so yeah,

2123
00:50:23.591 --> 00:50:24.424
that was it.

2124
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:25.510
That was it.

2125
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:25.691
Yeah.

2126
00:50:25.691 --> 00:50:26.201
It was rough,

2127
00:50:26.201 --> 00:50:26.530
man.

2128
00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:27.680
It was a loss.

2129
00:50:27.681 --> 00:50:28.160
And now

2130
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.140
<v 2>rumble just decided he doesn't want to fight anymore,</v>

2131
00:50:30.141 --> 00:50:30.980
which is kind of crazy.

2132
00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:31.873
Yeah.

2133
00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:33.140
Every now and then he thinks about it.

2134
00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:34.490
He said he wants to come back as a heavyweight.

2135
00:50:34.491 --> 00:50:34.930
Yeah.

2136
00:50:34.930 --> 00:50:35.510
Yeah.

2137
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:37.850
I don't think he was even gonna make it to light heavy.

2138
00:50:37.851 --> 00:50:40.100
And then now he's saw those pictures I've seen.

2139
00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:43.970
It's so crazy to think that that guy fought at one 70 at one point in his

2140
00:50:43.971 --> 00:50:44.420
career.

2141
00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:45.080
I can't even,

2142
00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:45.913
I can't even,

2143
00:50:46.070 --> 00:50:47.070
I can't even see that now.

2144
00:50:47.370 --> 00:50:49.220
I understand how even did it,

2145
00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:50.143
I mean,

2146
00:50:51.130 --> 00:50:51.501
he's,

2147
00:50:51.501 --> 00:50:53.840
he's neck is like the size of his head and he has small,

2148
00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:58.220
he has like this big round head and to make us the size of his head.

2149
00:50:58.221 --> 00:50:59.031
So he's now,

2150
00:50:59.031 --> 00:50:59.864
he's a big guy.

2151
00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:00.261
I really,

2152
00:51:00.261 --> 00:51:00.680
big guy.

2153
00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:02.840
I ran into him once while he was fighting.

2154
00:51:02.841 --> 00:51:03.630
One 70.

2155
00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:03.920
Uh,

2156
00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:05.180
he was in the lobby of a hotel.

2157
00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:07.100
I came downstairs and I go,

2158
00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:07.993
Anthony,

2159
00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:09.530
how much do you weigh?

2160
00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:10.820
And he starts laughing.

2161
00:51:10.821 --> 00:51:11.151
He's like,

2162
00:51:11.151 --> 00:51:11.381
dude,

2163
00:51:11.381 --> 00:51:12.200
30.

2164
00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:12.591
I was like,

2165
00:51:12.591 --> 00:51:14.900
two 30 you weighed two 30.

2166
00:51:14.901 --> 00:51:15.290
You got it.

2167
00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:17.050
That makes my wake.

2168
00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:17.400
I,

2169
00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:18.030
they see man,

2170
00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:18.561
I'm telling them,

2171
00:51:18.561 --> 00:51:20.150
I mixed my wake up.

2172
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:22.570
I wake at EDC,

2173
00:51:22.610 --> 00:51:22.820
I'm about,

2174
00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:24.050
his weight cut was horrific.

2175
00:51:24.051 --> 00:51:25.280
He used his whole,

2176
00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:25.891
his cheek.

2177
00:51:25.891 --> 00:51:26.541
She's just sucking.

2178
00:51:26.541 --> 00:51:27.860
He has prominent cheekbones.

2179
00:51:27.861 --> 00:51:28.280
Right.

2180
00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:32.600
So like when his weight cut was fully dehydrated,

2181
00:51:32.601 --> 00:51:33.440
when his body was like,

2182
00:51:33.441 --> 00:51:34.274
really,

2183
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:35.960
it was like horrible.

2184
00:51:35.961 --> 00:51:36.201
It's like,

2185
00:51:36.201 --> 00:51:36.391
look,

2186
00:51:36.391 --> 00:51:37.250
go a skeleton.

2187
00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:37.850
Oh Shit.

2188
00:51:37.850 --> 00:51:38.210
It's like,

2189
00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:38.810
man,

2190
00:51:38.810 --> 00:51:41.850
that's my goal for you all missed wait a bunch of times too.

2191
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.160
No,

2192
00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:42.380
no,

2193
00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:43.350
I'm going up to like takeaways.

2194
00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:45.200
He's probably the best thing he's ever done in his career.

2195
00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:46.093
I agree.

2196
00:51:46.590 --> 00:51:46.850
Yeah.

2197
00:51:46.850 --> 00:51:48.710
I was kind of stunned when he decided to retire,

2198
00:51:48.711 --> 00:51:49.940
but what he said was interesting.

2199
00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:50.773
He said,

2200
00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:52.280
I'm not a fighter.

2201
00:51:52.281 --> 00:51:52.581
He goes,

2202
00:51:52.581 --> 00:51:53.300
I'm an athlete.

2203
00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:53.571
He goes,

2204
00:51:53.571 --> 00:51:54.770
I'm just really good at fighting,

2205
00:51:56.340 --> 00:51:56.810
fighting.

2206
00:51:56.810 --> 00:51:58.070
I don't know if that's correct though.

2207
00:51:58.100 --> 00:51:59.030
I would say more like,

2208
00:51:59.031 --> 00:51:59.450
I like a,

2209
00:51:59.450 --> 00:52:00.283
like a fighter,

2210
00:52:00.930 --> 00:52:01.220
you know,

2211
00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:02.480
he's a great athlete but,

2212
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:04.580
but I see him more like a,

2213
00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:05.720
like a whole corps fighter.

2214
00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:06.650
I don't,

2215
00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:07.483
you know,

2216
00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:09.930
we are all athletes doing this but,

2217
00:52:09.931 --> 00:52:10.220
but,

2218
00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:12.020
but he's more like the fighter,

2219
00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:13.493
you know Phil Davis is,

2220
00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:14.373
he's an athlete.

2221
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:15.171
He's an athlete.

2222
00:52:15.171 --> 00:52:15.651
But this guy,

2223
00:52:15.651 --> 00:52:16.550
he's just like,

2224
00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:17.511
it's a fighter man.

2225
00:52:17.511 --> 00:52:18.770
I'm telling you.

2226
00:52:18.830 --> 00:52:19.760
Got gotta tell him man.

2227
00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:22.560
I mean if you watch his fight with Glover to sharer,

2228
00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:24.170
you watch his fight with little nog.

2229
00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:24.640
Yeah.

2230
00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:26.030
That mother fuckers are destroyer.

2231
00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:26.690
He does.

2232
00:52:26.690 --> 00:52:27.520
He's a destroyer.

2233
00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:28.130
Don't want to move.

2234
00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:28.963
Don't want to be in front of them.

2235
00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:31.630
And that shows you how fucking tough DC is.

2236
00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:32.900
That guy,

2237
00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:35.320
that guy twice I throw out everything I had in him.

2238
00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:36.320
Everything I had,

2239
00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:38.030
I need him in the face.

2240
00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:39.590
I kicked him in his buddy.

2241
00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:40.850
Sometimes I hit him and I saw,

2242
00:52:40.851 --> 00:52:41.060
he's like,

2243
00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:41.893
just goes like this.

2244
00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:42.640
I,

2245
00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:43.010
he just,

2246
00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:43.520
he just,

2247
00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:44.353
he just kept going.

2248
00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:45.440
It dcs and animal.

2249
00:52:45.550 --> 00:52:45.890
Yeah.

2250
00:52:45.890 --> 00:52:48.460
Four wheel drive just kept on going on

2251
00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:50.961
and he just,

2252
00:52:50.961 --> 00:52:51.701
same pay,

2253
00:52:51.701 --> 00:52:52.610
same pace.

2254
00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:55.460
If I fired him again,

2255
00:52:55.610 --> 00:52:57.230
I will not stand in this book.

2256
00:52:57.231 --> 00:52:58.130
I want to stand in front of him.

2257
00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:00.200
So you think that was the critical error,

2258
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:03.860
like right in front of 100% reach advantage?

2259
00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:04.490
Yeah,

2260
00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:05.121
I respect that.

2261
00:53:05.121 --> 00:53:06.170
He's wrestling too much.

2262
00:53:06.310 --> 00:53:07.530
Um,

2263
00:53:09.050 --> 00:53:09.883
so yeah,

2264
00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:11.030
like if I found him again,

2265
00:53:11.031 --> 00:53:12.590
I will do a way different way.

2266
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:13.101
Yeah.

2267
00:53:13.101 --> 00:53:14.450
I'm sure he'd do something different too though,

2268
00:53:14.451 --> 00:53:14.750
right?

2269
00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:15.590
He'd probably do.

2270
00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:16.651
You probably do,

2271
00:53:16.651 --> 00:53:18.440
but you still do one thing and call it like,

2272
00:53:18.441 --> 00:53:19.191
oh all the time.

2273
00:53:19.191 --> 00:53:20.060
Just keeps moving forward.

2274
00:53:20.061 --> 00:53:20.894
And that's what it does.

2275
00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:23.650
What you gotta do is you've got to catch him when he's coming down from

2276
00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:24.493
heavyweight,

2277
00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:25.353
he sees,

2278
00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:26.160
you remember

2279
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:28.180
<v 1>the towel lay is pushing down on it.</v>

2280
00:53:28.181 --> 00:53:29.014
And so awesome.

2281
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:30.350
I saw the idols,

2282
00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:31.213
I saw that

2283
00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:33.930
I want him to come down.

2284
00:53:33.931 --> 00:53:34.860
I hope it's coming down.

2285
00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:35.470
Yeah,

2286
00:53:35.470 --> 00:53:36.060
he can't,

2287
00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:37.030
he can't just snake.

2288
00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:38.130
No.

2289
00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:38.871
Take that fight.

2290
00:53:38.871 --> 00:53:39.704
And now he,

2291
00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:40.491
even if he wins,

2292
00:53:40.491 --> 00:53:41.130
it has to come,

2293
00:53:41.130 --> 00:53:42.520
come down and

2294
00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:45.730
defend and fight.

2295
00:53:45.731 --> 00:53:46.830
And if he beats deep bay,

2296
00:53:46.831 --> 00:53:48.120
he might freak Francis again.

2297
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.720
Who knows.

2298
00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:50.460
We might fight a Volkov who,

2299
00:53:50.461 --> 00:53:50.810
you know,

2300
00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:51.181
you could,

2301
00:53:51.181 --> 00:53:51.780
who could fight.

2302
00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:51.931
No,

2303
00:53:51.931 --> 00:53:52.661
he has to fight me.

2304
00:53:52.661 --> 00:53:53.491
It doesn't want to fight me,

2305
00:53:53.491 --> 00:53:54.301
but it has to fight me.

2306
00:53:54.301 --> 00:53:55.260
He has to in your mind,

2307
00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:56.820
he has to find out that you need,

2308
00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:57.860
that's what I need.

2309
00:53:57.860 --> 00:53:58.290
Yeah,

2310
00:53:58.290 --> 00:53:58.830
that's mine.

2311
00:53:58.830 --> 00:53:59.790
It's him or John.

2312
00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:03.780
So John's first you would like to be the first guy to fight John.

2313
00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:05.460
I welcome them back right away.

2314
00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:06.803
Yeah.

2315
00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:07.230
I mean,

2316
00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:07.471
I mean,

2317
00:54:07.471 --> 00:54:07.861
I'm trying,

2318
00:54:07.861 --> 00:54:08.694
I'm in camp.

2319
00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:09.631
I'm not in camp.

2320
00:54:09.631 --> 00:54:09.990
Sorry.

2321
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.950
I'm training right.

2322
00:54:11.170 --> 00:54:12.003
A feeling great.

2323
00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:13.140
My shoulder's good.

2324
00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:18.090
And I'm just waiting for an opportunity or the light heavyweight is pretty wide

2325
00:54:18.091 --> 00:54:18.924
open right now,

2326
00:54:19.050 --> 00:54:21.670
particularly with this decision for DC to fight against.

2327
00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:23.140
So we,

2328
00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:23.940
you have,

2329
00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:24.271
you know,

2330
00:54:24.271 --> 00:54:26.220
it's interesting like you have,

2331
00:54:26.310 --> 00:54:27.143
um,

2332
00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:29.040
[inaudible] who just lost,

2333
00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:29.490
right?

2334
00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:31.080
You got your friend Jimmy Manoa,

2335
00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:31.941
you have a,

2336
00:54:31.941 --> 00:54:34.620
a few guys who are at the top of the heap,

2337
00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:35.400
you know,

2338
00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:35.700
uh,

2339
00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:37.530
but you're the standout right now,

2340
00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:40.470
John being in the limbo.

2341
00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:40.741
Yeah.

2342
00:54:40.741 --> 00:54:41.574
He's gone.

2343
00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:42.000
No,

2344
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.640
nobody knows what's happening with him.

2345
00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:45.510
Light stands out to you in that division.

2346
00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:48.860
Ilir Yeah.

2347
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:49.130
Yeah.

2348
00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:50.040
And you know,

2349
00:54:50.070 --> 00:54:51.510
I want to find my teammates at radical.

2350
00:54:51.550 --> 00:54:52.730
I don't find my teammates really,

2351
00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:54.060
I've been turning it with him since I was,

2352
00:54:54.790 --> 00:54:55.561
I started my career.

2353
00:54:55.561 --> 00:54:56.394
So Jimmy,

2354
00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:58.050
Jimmy and the lawyer is,

2355
00:54:58.860 --> 00:54:59.191
you know,

2356
00:54:59.191 --> 00:55:01.380
we've been saying to each other that whatever happens,

2357
00:55:01.381 --> 00:55:02.280
we're not fighting each other,

2358
00:55:02.570 --> 00:55:02.960
you know.

2359
00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:03.793
Um,

2360
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:04.471
but,

2361
00:55:04.471 --> 00:55:05.304
uh,

2362
00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:05.551
yeah,

2363
00:55:05.551 --> 00:55:06.040
for the,

2364
00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:06.391
the only,

2365
00:55:06.391 --> 00:55:09.240
the only the only five that makes sense for me right now.

2366
00:55:09.241 --> 00:55:09.811
It's a,

2367
00:55:09.811 --> 00:55:13.320
it's fighting if finding the top guys in our rank number one right now,

2368
00:55:13.350 --> 00:55:14.850
so I can look back,

2369
00:55:14.851 --> 00:55:15.540
I can look down,

2370
00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:16.300
I have to look up,

2371
00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:16.990
right.

2372
00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:17.970
What's the next up here?

2373
00:55:18.690 --> 00:55:19.311
And,

2374
00:55:19.311 --> 00:55:20.144
uh,

2375
00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:21.690
if would take it from there,

2376
00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:22.561
we take it from there.

2377
00:55:22.561 --> 00:55:23.130
And,

2378
00:55:23.130 --> 00:55:23.910
uh,

2379
00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:25.020
like you said with John Jones,

2380
00:55:25.021 --> 00:55:25.561
he's in limbo.

2381
00:55:25.561 --> 00:55:26.610
I hope it comes back.

2382
00:55:26.970 --> 00:55:28.200
If it doesn't come back,

2383
00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:31.320
maybe a fight him in boxing.

2384
00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:33.240
I fight him inbox from two.

2385
00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:34.470
Why does he want to box?

2386
00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:35.670
He's been boxing lives.

2387
00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:36.513
Instagram.

2388
00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.400
That's all he do is box and right now we're really,

2389
00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:39.263
yeah,

2390
00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:41.070
I haven't paid attention to his Instagram.

2391
00:55:41.250 --> 00:55:42.570
He's boxing all the time.

2392
00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:43.260
Yeah.

2393
00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:44.093
Yeah.

2394
00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:44.770
I don't see,

2395
00:55:44.770 --> 00:55:46.590
see him coming back as a boxer though.

2396
00:55:46.930 --> 00:55:47.763
I mean that gun,

2397
00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:48.913
I'm a Gregor money.

2398
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:49.621
We could,

2399
00:55:49.621 --> 00:55:50.250
we could,

2400
00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:50.860
yeah.

2401
00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:51.720
That's another thing.

2402
00:55:51.721 --> 00:55:54.990
But we can think of like maybe a side show here.

2403
00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:56.430
We can box whatever.

2404
00:55:56.730 --> 00:55:58.590
You just want to get in there with them somehow or another.

2405
00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:00.360
Somehow somehow or another.

2406
00:56:00.361 --> 00:56:02.400
Your competitive drive once you get in there with them.

2407
00:56:02.401 --> 00:56:02.821
That was my,

2408
00:56:02.821 --> 00:56:03.654
that's my,

2409
00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:04.531
like I told you,

2410
00:56:04.531 --> 00:56:04.760
it's,

2411
00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:04.990
it's,

2412
00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:06.540
it's bigger than winning the belt.

2413
00:56:06.570 --> 00:56:07.440
That's your Mount Everest.

2414
00:56:07.570 --> 00:56:08.261
John Joan Jones.

2415
00:56:08.261 --> 00:56:10.030
Is John's out there going?

2416
00:56:10.050 --> 00:56:10.883
Yeah,

2417
00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:12.440
he knows.

2418
00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:14.790
He knows that he is.

2419
00:56:15.830 --> 00:56:16.980
He's still got that corvette.

2420
00:56:17.010 --> 00:56:18.540
Yo sell that thing and get a minivan.

2421
00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:20.083
Drive slow.

2422
00:56:20.130 --> 00:56:20.701
It looks good,

2423
00:56:20.701 --> 00:56:21.140
man.

2424
00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:21.871
Looks real good.

2425
00:56:21.871 --> 00:56:22.704
Yeah you do.

2426
00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:24.460
It's gotta be so frustrating

2427
00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:26.320
<v 0>for him to be in a situation that he's in.</v>

2428
00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:26.530
Yeah.

2429
00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:27.400
I don't even imagine.

2430
00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:27.761
Yeah,

2431
00:56:27.761 --> 00:56:28.720
I can imagine either.

2432
00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:29.763
It's fucked up.

2433
00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:31.510
It's a crazy situation to be in.

2434
00:56:32.650 --> 00:56:35.020
Did you see the outer called Colby Covington?

2435
00:56:35.970 --> 00:56:36.690
No.

2436
00:56:36.690 --> 00:56:38.530
What you said about John John's out.

2437
00:56:38.531 --> 00:56:39.364
Anyone want to hear it?

2438
00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:39.970
No.

2439
00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:40.301
Okay.

2440
00:56:40.301 --> 00:56:40.640
We shouldn't.

2441
00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:41.180
I mean you could,

2442
00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:42.400
you could bring it up if you want to,

2443
00:56:42.401 --> 00:56:43.800
but cold he was talking,

2444
00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:44.680
it was like,

2445
00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:45.640
it was a like a,

2446
00:56:46.210 --> 00:56:48.520
a text like this just about John Johnson,

2447
00:56:48.810 --> 00:56:49.870
how a piece of shit is

2448
00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:52.330
now.

2449
00:56:52.330 --> 00:56:54.280
I wasn't even surprised when I saw it myself,

2450
00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:54.700
you know?

2451
00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:55.533
I was like,

2452
00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:57.251
is this right or wrong?

2453
00:56:57.251 --> 00:56:58.084
I don't know.

2454
00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:00.670
Jon Jones is going to be in front of you one day.

2455
00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:01.781
Gotta be careful.

2456
00:57:01.781 --> 00:57:02.900
Watch your fucking words.

2457
00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:03.420
Yeah.

2458
00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:06.520
You gonna get slapped in the face by a guy can kill you with his hands.

2459
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:07.751
That's a,

2460
00:57:07.751 --> 00:57:10.570
that's a bad move I get with Colby is doing,

2461
00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:10.811
I mean,

2462
00:57:10.811 --> 00:57:12.940
he's making a lot of noise and trying to do business,

2463
00:57:12.970 --> 00:57:13.271
you know?

2464
00:57:13.271 --> 00:57:13.931
And if you fight him,

2465
00:57:13.931 --> 00:57:16.330
you gonna make a lot of money because a lot of people are going to come to see

2466
00:57:16.331 --> 00:57:17.260
him get his ass kicked,

2467
00:57:17.590 --> 00:57:17.910
you know?

2468
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:18.743
You know he has,

2469
00:57:19.090 --> 00:57:19.851
he's not probably on,

2470
00:57:19.851 --> 00:57:20.091
on the,

2471
00:57:20.091 --> 00:57:20.924
on the,

2472
00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:23.260
on the popper little list is probably on the,

2473
00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:24.911
I want you to see.

2474
00:57:24.911 --> 00:57:26.320
I want to see you get knocked out list.

2475
00:57:26.350 --> 00:57:28.240
He's in a dangerous situation right now.

2476
00:57:28.241 --> 00:57:29.560
He's going to fight those San Joe's.

2477
00:57:29.561 --> 00:57:30.010
Yeah.

2478
00:57:30.010 --> 00:57:30.531
How failed though?

2479
00:57:30.531 --> 00:57:31.840
San Joses Brazilian,

2480
00:57:31.841 --> 00:57:35.200
he talked crazy shit about Brazil and they were gonna fight in Brazil.

2481
00:57:35.530 --> 00:57:37.450
He's moved to Chicago.

2482
00:57:37.810 --> 00:57:38.950
Which Colby,

2483
00:57:39.250 --> 00:57:40.360
thank the baby Jesus.

2484
00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:42.400
I would say the same thing.

2485
00:57:42.590 --> 00:57:45.490
You don't want to be fighting Hoffeld does on Joe's.

2486
00:57:45.490 --> 00:57:46.350
You only want to kill you.

2487
00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:47.720
It only went back close to Brazilian.

2488
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.931
Right.

2489
00:57:47.931 --> 00:57:49.040
And I feel public coming from,

2490
00:57:49.130 --> 00:57:50.560
you don't even want to be close to him.

2491
00:57:50.590 --> 00:57:51.011
No,

2492
00:57:51.011 --> 00:57:51.791
I would not go.

2493
00:57:51.791 --> 00:57:52.624
If I was him,

2494
00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:53.620
he'd probably go anyway,

2495
00:57:53.621 --> 00:57:53.801
man.

2496
00:57:53.801 --> 00:57:54.610
He doesn't give a fuck.

2497
00:57:54.610 --> 00:57:55.750
He'll go off the money's right.

2498
00:57:55.751 --> 00:57:56.584
I'm sure he would.

2499
00:57:57.010 --> 00:57:59.620
But dos Santos right now at welterweight,

2500
00:57:59.621 --> 00:58:00.670
I think is a murderer.

2501
00:58:00.850 --> 00:58:01.810
He's a fucking killer.

2502
00:58:01.811 --> 00:58:05.980
At welterweight because for him that cut down to 55 was just too big,

2503
00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:06.940
too big.

2504
00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:07.900
And now he's the guy,

2505
00:58:08.110 --> 00:58:11.080
he's big and be just too much of a cot to draining on his body.

2506
00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:13.540
And then you see the way he beat Robbie Lawler in his last fight,

2507
00:58:13.541 --> 00:58:13.751
you're like,

2508
00:58:13.751 --> 00:58:14.590
Holy Shit.

2509
00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:15.970
That goes through Neil Magni,

2510
00:58:15.971 --> 00:58:16.781
Robbie Lawler.

2511
00:58:16.781 --> 00:58:18.960
And you'd look at how good he looks at one 70.

2512
00:58:18.970 --> 00:58:19.130
Like,

2513
00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:19.220
well,

2514
00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:19.980
tough shit.

2515
00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:20.650
It's a good fight.

2516
00:58:20.650 --> 00:58:21.191
It's a good fight.

2517
00:58:21.191 --> 00:58:21.941
Is a very good fun.

2518
00:58:21.941 --> 00:58:22.510
Yeah.

2519
00:58:22.510 --> 00:58:23.343
It's a really good fight.

2520
00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:24.490
Particularly stand up.

2521
00:58:24.491 --> 00:58:26.710
He has a big advantage I think over Colby.

2522
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:28.061
What does he do?

2523
00:58:28.061 --> 00:58:28.570
Call it bean,

2524
00:58:28.570 --> 00:58:29.690
but it takes a wrestler.

2525
00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:30.150
It's rest.

2526
00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:30.671
He's a restaurant.

2527
00:58:30.671 --> 00:58:31.080
Yeah.

2528
00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:31.600
Yeah.

2529
00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:32.321
It's standup as good.

2530
00:58:32.321 --> 00:58:32.501
I mean,

2531
00:58:32.501 --> 00:58:33.400
he beat Damien Maia.

2532
00:58:33.401 --> 00:58:34.234
I beat him up,

2533
00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:34.930
but I,

2534
00:58:34.930 --> 00:58:35.770
I feel like my,

2535
00:58:35.771 --> 00:58:35.891
uh,

2536
00:58:35.891 --> 00:58:36.724
is uh,

2537
00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:37.540
you know,

2538
00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:39.340
I mean my was coming off of that very,

2539
00:58:39.341 --> 00:58:41.260
very hard fight against Tyron Woodley.

2540
00:58:41.590 --> 00:58:46.090
Five hard rounds got beat up and then he's going to go five or I think he went

2541
00:58:46.091 --> 00:58:47.050
three rounds with Colby,

2542
00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:49.150
but I just don't think he's the same guy anymore.

2543
00:58:49.151 --> 00:58:50.890
I think he's 41.

2544
00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:53.110
I think my four game for a long time.

2545
00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:55.030
Long things being in the game for a very long time.

2546
00:58:55.090 --> 00:58:55.361
Yeah.

2547
00:58:55.361 --> 00:58:55.991
And I think,

2548
00:58:55.991 --> 00:58:56.410
uh,

2549
00:58:56.410 --> 00:58:58.770
those long hard five round war,

2550
00:58:58.771 --> 00:59:00.160
it's like you did with takes a toll on you.

2551
00:59:00.161 --> 00:59:00.700
Yeah.

2552
00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:03.130
It takes a toll on not taking anything away from Colby,

2553
00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:07.480
but I think also think Colby style is probably tailored married for a guy like

2554
00:59:07.481 --> 00:59:08.020
Maya.

2555
00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:08.820
Yeah.

2556
00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:09.131
You know,

2557
00:59:09.131 --> 00:59:10.350
wrestling very strong.

2558
00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:12.900
See like your breasts and guns.

2559
00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:14.900
Brazilian Jujitsu guys.

2560
00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:16.210
Yeah.

2561
00:59:16.210 --> 00:59:19.870
Right now you're a fucking decent guy.

2562
00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:20.823
You don't get in any,

2563
00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:22.220
you're not involved

2564
00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:23.300
<v 2>in any brawls.</v>

2565
00:59:23.301 --> 00:59:24.950
You don't get involved in the stupidity.

2566
00:59:24.951 --> 00:59:27.440
You're an excellent representative of a professional athlete.

2567
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:28.303
Thanks.

2568
00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:30.950
What do you think about all this Conor McGregor bullshit?

2569
00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:35.120
Like we see someone throwing a Dolly at on a bus and shattering a windows.

2570
00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:37.460
I don't even have words for it,

2571
00:59:37.461 --> 00:59:38.240
man.

2572
00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:39.170
I'm the words for it.

2573
00:59:40.730 --> 00:59:41.900
What did you think of when you heard that?

2574
00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:43.820
I heard the news when I landed,

2575
00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:47.270
I was in the plane when it was all happening flying to New York.

2576
00:59:47.570 --> 00:59:48.381
And when I landed,

2577
00:59:48.381 --> 00:59:49.214
my phone was like,

2578
00:59:50.730 --> 00:59:52.310
all these text messages coming in and going,

2579
00:59:52.311 --> 00:59:53.470
what the fuck is wrong with Connor?

2580
00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:53.930
What the,

2581
00:59:53.930 --> 00:59:54.231
I'm like,

2582
00:59:54.231 --> 00:59:55.100
what happened?

2583
00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:56.001
You know,

2584
00:59:56.001 --> 00:59:57.890
and then I check the news and I was like,

2585
00:59:57.950 --> 00:59:59.150
oh Christ.

2586
00:59:59.151 --> 01:00:02.270
And then I hear the two fights were pulled from the car and then three fights

2587
01:00:02.271 --> 01:00:03.104
were posing with the car.

2588
01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:05.001
Connor Mcgregor,

2589
01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:05.210
he,

2590
01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:05.870
he's just,

2591
01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:07.190
he's just losing it right now.

2592
01:00:07.790 --> 01:00:08.571
It feels like he's,

2593
01:00:08.571 --> 01:00:09.404
he's lost it.

2594
01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:10.723
I feel like,

2595
01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:14.170
you know,

2596
01:00:14.170 --> 01:00:16.010
I've never really been,

2597
01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:17.781
you know,

2598
01:00:17.781 --> 01:00:18.790
I respect all these things.

2599
01:00:18.791 --> 01:00:19.190
These does,

2600
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.650
he's,

2601
01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:19.910
he,

2602
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:20.311
he's a,

2603
01:00:20.311 --> 01:00:20.840
he's a,

2604
01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.280
he's a great businessman.

2605
01:00:22.281 --> 01:00:23.570
He'd do what it takes to make money.

2606
01:00:23.571 --> 01:00:25.060
He knows what it takes to get the money in.

2607
01:00:25.061 --> 01:00:26.750
And He'd do is he did really good.

2608
01:00:26.751 --> 01:00:26.971
He's,

2609
01:00:26.971 --> 01:00:27.321
he's a,

2610
01:00:27.321 --> 01:00:29.100
he's a mastermind when it comes to trash talking,

2611
01:00:29.110 --> 01:00:29.620
man.

2612
01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:29.940
He's telling,

2613
01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:30.773
he take his place,

2614
01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:32.900
he takes it to another level.

2615
01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:35.630
But like this thing he did,

2616
01:00:35.631 --> 01:00:36.860
now it's just,

2617
01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:37.341
it's,

2618
01:00:37.341 --> 01:00:38.120
uh,

2619
01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:38.871
it's just crazy.

2620
01:00:38.871 --> 01:00:39.530
You don't do that?

2621
01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:40.430
You don't do it at all?

2622
01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:40.830
I don't.

2623
01:00:40.830 --> 01:00:41.900
I don't know what it is.

2624
01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:43.340
Why is it doing it?

2625
01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:44.061
Yeah.

2626
01:00:44.061 --> 01:00:44.361
I don't know.

2627
01:00:44.361 --> 01:00:49.361
Either it's a drunk as fuck or is it just a bruise?

2628
01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:51.600
I wouldn't think that's a booze move.

2629
01:00:51.601 --> 01:00:52.590
That seems more like a coke.

2630
01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:53.683
It could be,

2631
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:54.540
I dunno.

2632
01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:56.270
It just could be part of his act.

2633
01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:56.720
Yeah,

2634
01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.940
but that's the thing like dude didn't take it that far.

2635
01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:02.570
You wouldn't take it that far too to just make some noise.

2636
01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:03.580
I Dunno.

2637
01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:08.210
Well what if my thing is like what of that that Dolly hit the car where rose was

2638
01:01:08.211 --> 01:01:09.890
sitting and cut roses face up.

2639
01:01:10.030 --> 01:01:10.160
No,

2640
01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:13.430
that was just be fuck Michael Key.

2641
01:01:13.431 --> 01:01:15.240
Esha I'm sad that he got cut,

2642
01:01:15.290 --> 01:01:16.890
but chess is a tough pastor.

2643
01:01:16.891 --> 01:01:17.724
It it'll be fine.

2644
01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:20.420
He's probably pissed off and he's going to sue Connor and it probably make a

2645
01:01:20.421 --> 01:01:21.430
shitload of money soon,

2646
01:01:22.070 --> 01:01:23.330
but it would have been hit rose.

2647
01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:23.900
No,

2648
01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:24.733
that would be bad.

2649
01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:25.823
Really bad.

2650
01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:26.680
I feel terrible.

2651
01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:28.040
I hate the fucking world would hate him.

2652
01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:30.960
Like rose was blinded in one eye because of that.

2653
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:35.600
That would be like what the fuck ray board got cuts in his eyes.

2654
01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:37.620
It's entirely pipe.

2655
01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:38.420
Got Glasses,

2656
01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:38.930
glass,

2657
01:01:38.930 --> 01:01:40.080
glass cuts in his eye.

2658
01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:41.630
He got glass shards,

2659
01:01:41.631 --> 01:01:46.631
he got scratched cornea or they all assume know or they shouldn't be.

2660
01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:48.590
I don't find out how many lawsuits.

2661
01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:54.040
I know key Essa filed key acid definitely file the lawsuit or file a complaint

2662
01:01:54.111 --> 01:01:55.310
which will lead to a lawsuit.

2663
01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:56.153
I imagined,

2664
01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:56.511
look,

2665
01:01:56.511 --> 01:02:00.980
I imagine if I was Connor I would settle the fucking every single thing outside

2666
01:02:00.981 --> 01:02:02.750
of court because if he loses,

2667
01:02:03.110 --> 01:02:04.850
if he loses and he gets a felony,

2668
01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:05.751
he's fucked.

2669
01:02:05.751 --> 01:02:07.520
He probably won't even be able to come into the country.

2670
01:02:07.610 --> 01:02:08.150
No,

2671
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:08.930
exactly.

2672
01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:09.590
No.

2673
01:02:09.590 --> 01:02:10.400
Here's my thing.

2674
01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.470
Imagine switching around.

2675
01:02:12.471 --> 01:02:16.540
Imagine if Ray Borg through that Dolly at the bus and Connor was.

2676
01:02:17.050 --> 01:02:17.271
Yeah,

2677
01:02:17.271 --> 01:02:18.104
he was a smoke.

2678
01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:19.090
Begun his career.

2679
01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:20.940
He will be gone for sure.

2680
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.460
That's one of the more fucked up things about the,

2681
01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:23.720
yeah.

2682
01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:23.910
Yeah.

2683
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:24.620
He will be gone.

2684
01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:24.841
Is it,

2685
01:02:24.841 --> 01:02:25.231
you know,

2686
01:02:25.231 --> 01:02:28.050
Connor is getting special treatment except of course if he is,

2687
01:02:28.051 --> 01:02:28.320
yeah,

2688
01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:28.840
of course.

2689
01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:29.221
Of course.

2690
01:02:29.221 --> 01:02:30.360
That's not good for anybody.

2691
01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:30.870
No,

2692
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:31.320
it's not.

2693
01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:32.153
It's not.

2694
01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:33.960
And like I told you,

2695
01:02:33.961 --> 01:02:34.351
he's just,

2696
01:02:34.351 --> 01:02:35.640
he's just losing his mind right now.

2697
01:02:35.641 --> 01:02:36.280
It's uh,

2698
01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:36.550
you,

2699
01:02:36.550 --> 01:02:39.810
you'd do it to a certain certain level and then you just like,

2700
01:02:41.010 --> 01:02:41.790
you just chill.

2701
01:02:41.790 --> 01:02:45.210
You don't take it further than what it just did.

2702
01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:46.230
So I don't know.

2703
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:47.220
I don't have any words for it.

2704
01:02:47.221 --> 01:02:47.550
Money.

2705
01:02:47.550 --> 01:02:48.720
I just feel like it's terrible.

2706
01:02:48.721 --> 01:02:52.350
It's terrible for everybody in the sport.

2707
01:02:52.351 --> 01:02:53.070
Man Dough.

2708
01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:53.671
It's terrible.

2709
01:02:53.671 --> 01:02:57.630
It's terrible for Connor even because he got a position where he's making money.

2710
01:02:57.631 --> 01:02:58.560
I don't know what he makes,

2711
01:02:58.730 --> 01:03:00.000
what he made for that may,

2712
01:03:00.001 --> 01:03:00.600
with the fight.

2713
01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:01.111
I'm telling you,

2714
01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:01.740
if we keep going,

2715
01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:02.520
what he's doing that,

2716
01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:06.360
that the money is not going to be enough to pay all that shit has to pay.

2717
01:03:06.410 --> 01:03:06.820
No,

2718
01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:07.140
no.

2719
01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:08.040
He'll burn right through that.

2720
01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.020
But he's probably burned through that money anyway.

2721
01:03:10.021 --> 01:03:10.681
Every time you see him,

2722
01:03:10.681 --> 01:03:11.580
he's got a new Bentley.

2723
01:03:12.450 --> 01:03:13.860
Probably lives in a mansion now.

2724
01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:14.191
Oh yeah,

2725
01:03:14.191 --> 01:03:17.100
he does 100% he has this private jet.

2726
01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:18.660
I don't know how many bounces.

2727
01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:19.800
I Dunno what you hit menu,

2728
01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:21.390
what you call it,

2729
01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:22.740
a body guards you have when?

2730
01:03:22.770 --> 01:03:23.050
When,

2731
01:03:23.050 --> 01:03:23.400
when he,

2732
01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.100
when he hit that guy in Ireland,

2733
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:27.000
the gangster guy,

2734
01:03:27.010 --> 01:03:27.960
he didn't an island.

2735
01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:30.870
You had a bunch of like bodyguards I heard around it.

2736
01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:32.060
But today cost every day.

2737
01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:33.880
They're not cheap though.

2738
01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:34.630
Yeah.

2739
01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:34.890
That,

2740
01:03:34.890 --> 01:03:35.940
that money piles up.

2741
01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:37.710
But when you're 29 years old,

2742
01:03:37.711 --> 01:03:38.191
like Connor,

2743
01:03:38.191 --> 01:03:39.330
you don't even think about it.

2744
01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:39.630
No,

2745
01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:40.080
you don't.

2746
01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:41.010
He's thinking about now,

2747
01:03:41.011 --> 01:03:41.701
not the future.

2748
01:03:41.701 --> 01:03:43.480
And he probably thinks he's got hundreds of millions.

2749
01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:44.420
The sad part of it,

2750
01:03:44.430 --> 01:03:44.830
man,

2751
01:03:44.830 --> 01:03:47.630
that's a sub because do what he's doing,

2752
01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:48.751
whatever it is,

2753
01:03:48.751 --> 01:03:49.680
a billion or whatever it is.

2754
01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:50.670
It's not a lot of money.

2755
01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:52.200
It's going to run through you.

2756
01:03:52.290 --> 01:03:53.123
Well,

2757
01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:54.083
there's that.

2758
01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:54.721
And then there's,

2759
01:03:54.721 --> 01:03:59.310
the thing that really gets me is that what Conor is,

2760
01:03:59.730 --> 01:04:02.220
is an exceptional world championship fighter.

2761
01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:02.461
I mean,

2762
01:04:02.461 --> 01:04:03.390
that's what he really is.

2763
01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:08.010
All this other stuff is the bullshit is going to get in the way of his legacy.

2764
01:04:08.290 --> 01:04:08.840
I mean he,

2765
01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:13.530
his legacy shouldn't be a boxing match where he's Tko owed by the greatest boxer

2766
01:04:13.531 --> 01:04:13.741
ever.

2767
01:04:13.741 --> 01:04:14.760
That's fucking stupid.

2768
01:04:14.761 --> 01:04:15.020
Yeah.

2769
01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:17.630
And his legacy should be the next fight after any algorithm.

2770
01:04:17.830 --> 01:04:18.541
I know what you mean,

2771
01:04:18.541 --> 01:04:18.900
man.

2772
01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:20.020
And I'm watching over us was,

2773
01:04:20.021 --> 01:04:20.280
um,

2774
01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:21.113
that was a master.

2775
01:04:21.130 --> 01:04:21.481
He's,

2776
01:04:21.481 --> 01:04:21.960
he's,

2777
01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:24.270
he's been smashing beasts.

2778
01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:26.250
It's been taking two belts.

2779
01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:27.111
He said he's a,

2780
01:04:27.111 --> 01:04:27.390
he's a,

2781
01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:28.223
he's a,

2782
01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:31.020
he's just a regular guy from Ireland.

2783
01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:32.093
It comes to this,

2784
01:04:32.130 --> 01:04:33.210
it comes to America.

2785
01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:34.800
He just lives the American dream.

2786
01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:38.490
I don't think nobody has done before.

2787
01:04:38.550 --> 01:04:38.821
So,

2788
01:04:38.821 --> 01:04:39.031
you know,

2789
01:04:39.031 --> 01:04:39.360
it's,

2790
01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:40.193
it's terrible.

2791
01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:42.570
It's terrible to see all this shit happen.

2792
01:04:42.690 --> 01:04:42.961
Yeah.

2793
01:04:42.961 --> 01:04:45.630
Cause I'm saying that all these things that are happening,

2794
01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:47.040
it's bad for him.

2795
01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:47.460
Yeah,

2796
01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:47.910
of course.

2797
01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:50.250
It's not just bad for the sport to let them get away with it.

2798
01:04:50.251 --> 01:04:51.600
It's all apps up and they would,

2799
01:04:51.601 --> 01:04:52.270
all this happen.

2800
01:04:52.270 --> 01:04:55.020
You don't even like think of what has been doing in the octagon.

2801
01:04:55.050 --> 01:04:55.350
Right,

2802
01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:56.070
exactly.

2803
01:04:56.070 --> 01:04:56.903
Exactly.

2804
01:04:57.150 --> 01:05:00.720
I mean just think about setting him up with could be,

2805
01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:01.531
you know,

2806
01:05:01.531 --> 01:05:04.170
having that fight like Jesus fucking Christ.

2807
01:05:04.171 --> 01:05:05.250
That would be a giant fight.

2808
01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:09.210
That might be one of the biggest MMA fights ever to make him versus cubbies

2809
01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:10.313
cubbies.

2810
01:05:10.350 --> 01:05:15.350
Let's just record (252) 069-0620 6 cents and it's barely tested.

2811
01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:17.581
It's tested.

2812
01:05:17.581 --> 01:05:17.920
Yeah.

2813
01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:18.580
As amazing.

2814
01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:19.860
You see one little flaw in him,

2815
01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:21.460
you get all excited because it's like,

2816
01:05:21.461 --> 01:05:22.120
oh look,

2817
01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:23.550
he's keeping his chin up when the fight.

2818
01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:24.670
What's that?

2819
01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:25.600
Who Do you think when that fight?

2820
01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:26.463
It's a good question.

2821
01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:31.050
It's well at the question is can Connor Ketchum can kind of catch them eyes

2822
01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:32.860
coming in and if Connor can catch him,

2823
01:05:32.861 --> 01:05:34.090
look Coggin knock anybody out.

2824
01:05:34.550 --> 01:05:34.970
I mean,

2825
01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:35.120
look,

2826
01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:35.680
you see what he,

2827
01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:36.820
what he did to Eddie Alvarez.

2828
01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:37.920
You see what he did to Aldo.

2829
01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:40.960
Nobody had ever done that to Aldo before world.

2830
01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.780
That that's the best strikers in the division.

2831
01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:44.320
Yeah.

2832
01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:45.430
And what conduit has,

2833
01:05:45.431 --> 01:05:48.570
is incredible precision and the ability to his,

2834
01:05:48.790 --> 01:05:49.260
his family,

2835
01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:50.590
he's so fast,

2836
01:05:50.591 --> 01:05:51.160
so fast.

2837
01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:51.581
You speed,

2838
01:05:51.581 --> 01:05:52.260
he's angles,

2839
01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:52.720
he moves,

2840
01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:53.553
he moves,

2841
01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:55.990
create an angle and he just counted the shit out of the guys.

2842
01:05:55.991 --> 01:05:57.100
And yeah,

2843
01:05:57.101 --> 01:05:57.370
that's,

2844
01:05:57.370 --> 01:05:58.121
that's all he needs.

2845
01:05:58.121 --> 01:05:59.440
He also moves unusual.

2846
01:05:59.441 --> 01:06:01.120
He moves almost like a karate guy.

2847
01:06:01.121 --> 01:06:01.471
He does,

2848
01:06:01.471 --> 01:06:01.751
you know,

2849
01:06:01.751 --> 01:06:02.770
like wide stance,

2850
01:06:02.771 --> 01:06:03.730
but then knocks you out like,

2851
01:06:03.731 --> 01:06:04.121
oh look,

2852
01:06:04.121 --> 01:06:06.670
a real pro boxer like doughnut thing.

2853
01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:08.560
I'm doubting it's corner.

2854
01:06:08.561 --> 01:06:08.801
Yeah.

2855
01:06:08.801 --> 01:06:09.071
You know,

2856
01:06:09.071 --> 01:06:09.201
he,

2857
01:06:09.201 --> 01:06:09.491
he's,

2858
01:06:09.491 --> 01:06:09.731
he's,

2859
01:06:09.731 --> 01:06:12.250
he's the best striker and all of that.

2860
01:06:12.251 --> 01:06:14.250
But does he had the conditioning for Colby?

2861
01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:15.513
That's a good question.

2862
01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:16.120
It's kind of weird.

2863
01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:16.631
He just,

2864
01:06:16.631 --> 01:06:17.411
he just keeps going.

2865
01:06:17.411 --> 01:06:18.250
And just for an animal.

2866
01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:18.790
Yeah.

2867
01:06:18.790 --> 01:06:19.930
And it's also the wrestling,

2868
01:06:20.450 --> 01:06:21.011
like Khabib is,

2869
01:06:21.011 --> 01:06:23.590
wrestling is not just a level above everybody else,

2870
01:06:23.591 --> 01:06:24.910
but multiple levels.

2871
01:06:25.130 --> 01:06:25.963
He just,

2872
01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:28.040
I heard like heavy guys,

2873
01:06:28.070 --> 01:06:29.200
I'm talking by heavyweights,

2874
01:06:29.201 --> 01:06:31.330
talking about cabbies pressure on the ground and be on the top.

2875
01:06:31.390 --> 01:06:32.223
Yeah.

2876
01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:32.920
Yeah.

2877
01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:33.670
Taking that,

2878
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:34.680
that Ciba,

2879
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:37.090
that seat belt around taking his hands,

2880
01:06:37.091 --> 01:06:38.170
Moon that leg up,

2881
01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:39.490
neutrals to go.

2882
01:06:39.610 --> 01:06:40.180
Totally.

2883
01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:44.830
So Luke Rockhold said he never loses around and training and he said,

2884
01:06:45.010 --> 01:06:46.050
he said he doesn't lose around.

2885
01:06:46.090 --> 01:06:46.800
Yeah.

2886
01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:47.750
It doesn't lose around.

2887
01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:49.030
He just smashes everybody.

2888
01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:49.870
That's insane.

2889
01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:50.850
Everybody wrestles with him.

2890
01:06:50.851 --> 01:06:51.040
I'm like,

2891
01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:51.790
fuck,

2892
01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:53.860
you tend to go to the grinder.

2893
01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:56.110
It's like those fucking guys in Dagestan,

2894
01:06:56.111 --> 01:06:56.351
man,

2895
01:06:56.351 --> 01:07:01.060
New York Times had an article about Dagestan wrestling and about how these guys,

2896
01:07:01.061 --> 01:07:04.150
they have very few options and so a lot of them,

2897
01:07:04.330 --> 01:07:04.661
you know,

2898
01:07:04.661 --> 01:07:07.510
they go towards the dark side and get involved in terrorism.

2899
01:07:07.511 --> 01:07:10.330
I was other things and this is the way to go towards the light side.

2900
01:07:10.570 --> 01:07:11.440
They go sports.

2901
01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:12.293
Yeah.

2902
01:07:12.310 --> 01:07:14.770
And they have a different mindset there through if you're doing good,

2903
01:07:14.771 --> 01:07:15.250
if you are,

2904
01:07:15.250 --> 01:07:15.881
if you are a,

2905
01:07:15.881 --> 01:07:16.520
like if,

2906
01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:18.460
if you win the world games or whatever,

2907
01:07:18.490 --> 01:07:19.330
they take care of you.

2908
01:07:19.390 --> 01:07:21.350
They really support to the whole government.

2909
01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:23.050
Whole country's carrying you off from the Mac.

2910
01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:25.150
The carry into your king there.

2911
01:07:25.290 --> 01:07:26.000
Yeah.

2912
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:26.833
Just,

2913
01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:28.840
it's a great motivation,

2914
01:07:28.841 --> 01:07:29.051
man.

2915
01:07:29.051 --> 01:07:30.360
That's there.

2916
01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:31.213
They're just,

2917
01:07:31.290 --> 01:07:31.570
yeah,

2918
01:07:31.570 --> 01:07:32.403
the animals.

2919
01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:33.490
The animals.

2920
01:07:33.490 --> 01:07:34.660
Did you see that beat fight?

2921
01:07:36.410 --> 01:07:38.740
Who is a beat magomed sharp off.

2922
01:07:38.830 --> 01:07:41.220
He fought a on the undercard of uh,

2923
01:07:41.250 --> 01:07:41.401
no,

2924
01:07:41.401 --> 01:07:42.070
I don't think so.

2925
01:07:42.070 --> 01:07:43.030
Holy Shit.

2926
01:07:43.031 --> 01:07:45.910
He's another one from Dagestan and not the one that another one,

2927
01:07:45.911 --> 01:07:47.140
but he's totally different.

2928
01:07:47.290 --> 01:07:51.190
He's like six foot one fights at one 45 yeah.

2929
01:07:51.191 --> 01:07:51.780
That guy.

2930
01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:52.770
Yeah,

2931
01:07:52.771 --> 01:07:53.240
they guy.

2932
01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:53.410
Yeah.

2933
01:07:53.410 --> 01:07:55.060
I think his background is actually like,

2934
01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:55.730
um,

2935
01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:57.850
I'm gonna say it's woo Shu or something like that.

2936
01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.130
I think he started off as a Kung Fu guy,

2937
01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:01.050
but who,

2938
01:08:01.050 --> 01:08:01.883
who did it go?

2939
01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:02.930
He won that file.

2940
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:04.630
BOCHNIAC rate fight.

2941
01:08:04.650 --> 01:08:06.430
It's the crazy three round fight.

2942
01:08:06.431 --> 01:08:08.110
Bochniac just kept coming at him,

2943
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:09.190
kept coming at him.

2944
01:08:09.370 --> 01:08:11.020
And then at the end of the third round,

2945
01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:14.530
bochniac finally has him cornered up against the cage and he's teeing off on

2946
01:08:14.531 --> 01:08:14.660
him.

2947
01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:15.493
Phenomenal.

2948
01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:16.581
<v 0>I mean,</v>

2949
01:08:16.581 --> 01:08:20.630
phenomenal fight for the toughness of Basquiat and this skill of beat.

2950
01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:22.970
But even with fucking phenomenal,

2951
01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:24.590
just this ridiculous tech,

2952
01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:25.010
this guy,

2953
01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:25.701
not even a restaurant.

2954
01:08:25.701 --> 01:08:25.881
He's a,

2955
01:08:25.881 --> 01:08:26.660
he's a talker.

2956
01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:27.500
He's a strike of Buddy's.

2957
01:08:27.501 --> 01:08:28.670
Got Wrestling to me.

2958
01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:32.330
His wrestling is good too and it's his take down defense is very good and his

2959
01:08:32.331 --> 01:08:33.530
Jujitsu is very good too.

2960
01:08:33.531 --> 01:08:36.410
But his fucking striking crazy shit.

2961
01:08:36.411 --> 01:08:38.090
We'll kicks front leg,

2962
01:08:38.091 --> 01:08:39.350
roundhouse kicks to the face,

2963
01:08:39.351 --> 01:08:40.310
switch kicks,

2964
01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:41.300
just everything.

2965
01:08:41.690 --> 01:08:42.140
Everything.

2966
01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:43.100
Lightening fast.

2967
01:08:43.190 --> 01:08:44.090
Perfect technique.

2968
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:45.830
And here's a big thing too,

2969
01:08:45.831 --> 01:08:46.970
is his footwork.

2970
01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:47.900
When he lands,

2971
01:08:47.901 --> 01:08:49.520
he's always in perfect position.

2972
01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:51.490
Everything he does when he comes down,

2973
01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:52.640
he's never awkward.

2974
01:08:52.641 --> 01:08:53.420
He's never like,

2975
01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:54.860
his legs are never crossed up.

2976
01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:57.410
Nothing but phenomenal technique.

2977
01:08:57.490 --> 01:08:58.490
I was impressed with to see.

2978
01:08:58.491 --> 01:08:59.450
It's impressive to see what,

2979
01:08:59.451 --> 01:08:59.700
when,

2980
01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:00.380
when,

2981
01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:00.920
when,

2982
01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:03.950
when guys are like good strike I guess with good kicks.

2983
01:09:03.951 --> 01:09:04.461
For example,

2984
01:09:04.461 --> 01:09:05.590
John Jones for example,

2985
01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:06.710
the kick high,

2986
01:09:06.711 --> 01:09:11.070
the kick from different angles to kick it and they just land like,

2987
01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:14.270
like they haven't kicked the land light really good,

2988
01:09:14.271 --> 01:09:15.140
good base.

2989
01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:16.190
They're ready for another,

2990
01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:17.720
for account that are ready for this.

2991
01:09:18.170 --> 01:09:19.070
It's impressive to see.

2992
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:21.470
So for you as a guy who,

2993
01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:25.640
if you had to say you have one area in your game that needs the most work,

2994
01:09:25.641 --> 01:09:26.690
you'd say that's you're kicking.

2995
01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:28.950
<v 1>Well,</v>

2996
01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:29.820
I think I,

2997
01:09:29.821 --> 01:09:30.151
you know,

2998
01:09:30.151 --> 01:09:30.984
uh,

2999
01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:31.500
I dunno.

3000
01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:32.333
Yeah,

3001
01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:33.091
of course.

3002
01:09:33.091 --> 01:09:33.980
Kicking is one of the old,

3003
01:09:33.981 --> 01:09:38.981
one of the things I think I have to work on a lock manner that's um,

3004
01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:39.481
I'm,

3005
01:09:39.481 --> 01:09:40.320
I'm far from,

3006
01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:41.550
I would probably never be

3007
01:09:43.230 --> 01:09:45.120
a complete fighter.

3008
01:09:45.530 --> 01:09:46.860
I have to work on everything.

3009
01:09:46.861 --> 01:09:47.041
You know,

3010
01:09:47.041 --> 01:09:49.350
I need to keep my kid working on my boxing.

3011
01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:50.970
I have to keep working with my footwork.

3012
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:52.200
I have to keep working on my kicks,

3013
01:09:52.201 --> 01:09:52.591
my knees,

3014
01:09:52.591 --> 01:09:53.131
my elbows,

3015
01:09:53.131 --> 01:09:53.964
my grabbing,

3016
01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:55.590
my wrestling.

3017
01:09:55.650 --> 01:09:56.483
Uh,

3018
01:09:56.490 --> 01:09:57.330
keep my chin down,

3019
01:09:57.331 --> 01:09:58.030
got up,

3020
01:09:58.030 --> 01:09:58.863
<v 0>all that shit</v>

3021
01:10:01.370 --> 01:10:02.380
just keeps going.

3022
01:10:02.650 --> 01:10:03.510
Just keeps going.

3023
01:10:03.730 --> 01:10:04.380
Who Do you like it?

3024
01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:05.213
<v 1>Watch fight.</v>

3025
01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:08.400
I like to watch to my teammates fight.

3026
01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:09.070
I like,

3027
01:10:09.070 --> 01:10:09.903
I like,

3028
01:10:09.930 --> 01:10:11.880
I like seeing guys in my division.

3029
01:10:12.810 --> 01:10:15.270
I should be honest to your arm up now.

3030
01:10:15.390 --> 01:10:16.260
I'm not really,

3031
01:10:17.310 --> 01:10:18.140
uh,

3032
01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:18.830
I'm not,

3033
01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:21.480
I'm not a guy that really watch fights.

3034
01:10:21.810 --> 01:10:22.860
I don't watch all the fights.

3035
01:10:22.861 --> 01:10:25.970
I don't know about barely watched in any fights or just fight.

3036
01:10:26.370 --> 01:10:26.860
If I know,

3037
01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:27.330
uh,

3038
01:10:27.330 --> 01:10:27.660
uh,

3039
01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:28.500
into my teammates,

3040
01:10:28.530 --> 01:10:31.230
my teammates or competition fights,

3041
01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:33.420
my competition is fighting.

3042
01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:34.440
I fight,

3043
01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:35.430
I look at the fights,

3044
01:10:35.550 --> 01:10:36.383
but uh,

3045
01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:37.140
oh,

3046
01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:37.501
good,

3047
01:10:37.501 --> 01:10:39.450
good title defenses and stuff like that.

3048
01:10:39.451 --> 01:10:40.570
But I don't,

3049
01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:41.880
I don't barely watch fights.

3050
01:10:41.970 --> 01:10:44.520
Do you think it's because it's just too much a part of your life?

3051
01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:47.280
It's just think it's important that you have some distance too.

3052
01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:48.780
You have some distance to,

3053
01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:50.600
to work in.

3054
01:10:50.610 --> 01:10:51.391
It is a work.

3055
01:10:51.391 --> 01:10:53.760
Even if you're hopping in lifestyle and your passion is,

3056
01:10:53.790 --> 01:10:54.061
it's a,

3057
01:10:54.061 --> 01:10:56.160
it's a work and you need some distance.

3058
01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:57.053
And my distance,

3059
01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:57.991
like I told you,

3060
01:10:57.991 --> 01:11:01.020
it's been I my distances and being outdoors,

3061
01:11:01.021 --> 01:11:01.740
hunting,

3062
01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:02.573
uh,

3063
01:11:03.150 --> 01:11:05.380
friendly and France and all,

3064
01:11:05.470 --> 01:11:08.700
so it doesn't interest me to watch the fights.

3065
01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:09.870
It's getting too much of it.

3066
01:11:09.871 --> 01:11:11.130
It's particularly when in camp.

3067
01:11:11.131 --> 01:11:11.964
Um,

3068
01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:12.930
I don't know what try to at all.

3069
01:11:13.050 --> 01:11:14.160
I get it gets too much,

3070
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:14.971
<v 2>I would imagine.</v>

3071
01:11:14.971 --> 01:11:15.210
Yeah.

3072
01:11:15.210 --> 01:11:17.790
I mean you're probably spending five hours a day just training.

3073
01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:18.250
Yeah.

3074
01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:18.480
Yeah.

3075
01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:18.661
No,

3076
01:11:18.661 --> 01:11:18.841
it's,

3077
01:11:18.841 --> 01:11:19.860
it gets too much more.

3078
01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:20.970
But as like,

3079
01:11:20.971 --> 01:11:23.570
I thought if I know John John's is firing dcs,

3080
01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:24.413
fine.

3081
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:25.470
Vulcan is firing.

3082
01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:26.490
I watch those fights.

3083
01:11:26.491 --> 01:11:27.324
Right.

3084
01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:30.690
Do you have a guide that's like your favorite guy to watch?

3085
01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:34.680
Like a mighty mouse or someone or Anderson Silva or someone?

3086
01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:35.871
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

3087
01:11:35.871 --> 01:11:36.441
those guys.

3088
01:11:36.441 --> 01:11:37.430
I watch those guys.

3089
01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:37.880
Yeah.

3090
01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:38.300
I watch,

3091
01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:38.641
I watch.

3092
01:11:38.641 --> 01:11:40.160
Might Amass that guy is incredible.

3093
01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:41.220
Yeah.

3094
01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:41.521
<v 2>He,</v>

3095
01:11:41.521 --> 01:11:42.180
he's,

3096
01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:44.040
he's has down,

3097
01:11:44.041 --> 01:11:44.874
he's the best guy.

3098
01:11:45.150 --> 01:11:46.560
Sometimes no competing.

3099
01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:48.660
Wonder what it would be like if you were that light,

3100
01:11:49.230 --> 01:11:53.070
what would it be like if I only to 125 pounds be so fast.

3101
01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:55.513
I'm a fast and like,

3102
01:11:56.090 --> 01:11:59.650
do you see my shadow either running around like this?

3103
01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:00.340
I know.

3104
01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:00.781
Crazy,

3105
01:12:00.781 --> 01:12:01.500
right?

3106
01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:03.450
I mean mighty mouse is so fast.

3107
01:12:03.451 --> 01:12:05.010
One time I've told this story before,

3108
01:12:05.011 --> 01:12:07.590
but one time like I grabbed him just playing around from behind him.

3109
01:12:07.591 --> 01:12:08.161
Like what's up?

3110
01:12:08.161 --> 01:12:08.994
I grabbed him,

3111
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.560
he turned and kneed me in the body two times before I even knew he did anything

3112
01:12:13.561 --> 01:12:14.230
man.

3113
01:12:14.230 --> 01:12:14.820
And I went,

3114
01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:15.810
oh dude,

3115
01:12:16.230 --> 01:12:17.370
that was ridiculous.

3116
01:12:17.490 --> 01:12:17.671
I'm like,

3117
01:12:17.671 --> 01:12:19.200
how the fuck did you move that quick?

3118
01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:20.530
You know,

3119
01:12:20.530 --> 01:12:20.740
he,

3120
01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:21.391
he's flights.

3121
01:12:21.391 --> 01:12:22.470
It's amazing to see.

3122
01:12:22.471 --> 01:12:23.570
And the way he,

3123
01:12:23.571 --> 01:12:24.100
he,

3124
01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:25.230
he finished his flights,

3125
01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:26.171
the one he,

3126
01:12:26.171 --> 01:12:26.530
he,

3127
01:12:26.530 --> 01:12:27.130
he,

3128
01:12:27.130 --> 01:12:27.640
he's crazy.

3129
01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:28.950
He's like throwing the guy,

3130
01:12:28.951 --> 01:12:31.340
taking that arm bar in the air.

3131
01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:32.400
Yeah,

3132
01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.140
yeah.

3133
01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:33.360
No,

3134
01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:37.080
it was just amazing to see plex him and took the arm bargain there on the way

3135
01:12:37.081 --> 01:12:39.360
down retires fucking video game shit.

3136
01:12:39.390 --> 01:12:39.960
It is.

3137
01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:40.620
It is.

3138
01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:41.610
He said he drills that.

3139
01:12:41.850 --> 01:12:42.060
No,

3140
01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:42.893
it's insane.

3141
01:12:43.210 --> 01:12:44.740
He drills all the time like that.

3142
01:12:44.741 --> 01:12:45.890
It pays to get against a loss.

3143
01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:47.100
It probably gets it from the video.

3144
01:12:47.101 --> 01:12:47.940
I have to try this,

3145
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:49.531
try this,

3146
01:12:49.531 --> 01:12:50.430
and then he goes and do it.

3147
01:12:51.150 --> 01:12:51.540
Yeah.

3148
01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:52.373
That's crazy.

3149
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:52.591
No.

3150
01:12:52.591 --> 01:12:54.480
Do you do watch a lot of boxing?

3151
01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:56.400
Well,

3152
01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:56.671
yeah,

3153
01:12:56.671 --> 01:12:57.810
I'll watch the big fights.

3154
01:12:57.900 --> 01:12:58.980
I watch the big fights.

3155
01:13:00.010 --> 01:13:00.843
<v 1>I do,</v>

3156
01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.470
but I'm not,

3157
01:13:02.471 --> 01:13:03.100
I'm not really,

3158
01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:03.933
uh,

3159
01:13:04.270 --> 01:13:07.030
a guy that I've watched a lot of fights overall

3160
01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:07.940
<v 2>is seeing.</v>

3161
01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:09.060
It's just because like you said,

3162
01:13:09.061 --> 01:13:09.894
you need distance.

3163
01:13:10.710 --> 01:13:12.210
It's not in my interest in,

3164
01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:14.250
you know,

3165
01:13:14.250 --> 01:13:15.390
I got guys in my team,

3166
01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:16.950
they're like such a nurse.

3167
01:13:16.951 --> 01:13:17.784
They,

3168
01:13:17.950 --> 01:13:18.530
they own it,

3169
01:13:18.530 --> 01:13:19.470
they own the data board.

3170
01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:21.030
Did they know everything about everyone?

3171
01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:23.280
They don't even train themselves.

3172
01:13:23.310 --> 01:13:24.780
They just know everything about everyone.

3173
01:13:24.781 --> 01:13:25.590
And that's enough for me.

3174
01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:26.880
They just told me it was this,

3175
01:13:26.881 --> 01:13:27.481
I asked them,

3176
01:13:27.481 --> 01:13:27.750
they're like,

3177
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:27.890
oh,

3178
01:13:27.890 --> 01:13:28.381
don't you know,

3179
01:13:28.381 --> 01:13:28.890
I'm no,

3180
01:13:28.890 --> 01:13:29.790
who's this dude?

3181
01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:31.490
He has the skills around.

3182
01:13:31.530 --> 01:13:31.860
Okay,

3183
01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:32.693
good.

3184
01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:33.930
<v 1>So I,</v>

3185
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.903
yeah,

3186
01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:36.220
<v 2>so like when you're in camp,</v>

3187
01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:37.091
do you,

3188
01:13:37.091 --> 01:13:40.240
what do you do to try to relax and like for downtime,

3189
01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:41.770
do you try to read books?

3190
01:13:41.771 --> 01:13:42.670
Do you watch TV?

3191
01:13:42.671 --> 01:13:43.630
Do you play video games?

3192
01:13:43.631 --> 01:13:44.464
Like what do you do?

3193
01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:46.220
<v 1>Um,</v>

3194
01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:47.050
I'm actually,

3195
01:13:47.050 --> 01:13:50.440
I'm actually spending time outdoors during camp,

3196
01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:51.340
during camp.

3197
01:13:51.850 --> 01:13:52.683
That's what I do.

3198
01:13:53.290 --> 01:13:54.430
That's my way to,

3199
01:13:54.970 --> 01:13:56.890
to get away from everything.

3200
01:13:58.260 --> 01:13:58.480
You know,

3201
01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:00.520
watch what's a serious hanging out with,

3202
01:14:00.690 --> 01:14:01.990
with my family and stuff.

3203
01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:02.380
But,

3204
01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:03.400
but for me,

3205
01:14:03.401 --> 01:14:05.020
the real distance I get when I'm,

3206
01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:10.080
when I'm outdoors hunting or up dogs or you know,

3207
01:14:11.290 --> 01:14:11.800
I usually,

3208
01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:12.730
I don't even have to hunt.

3209
01:14:12.731 --> 01:14:14.500
I should I just go out there and hike.

3210
01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:14.900
Yeah.

3211
01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:15.733
Hike.

3212
01:14:16.150 --> 01:14:18.700
I got some lands not far from Stockholm.

3213
01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:21.310
I go out there and just hanging out,

3214
01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:21.881
you know,

3215
01:14:21.881 --> 01:14:23.080
sometimes I'm just tracking,

3216
01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:24.400
Oh what's this?

3217
01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:25.330
Oh that's a wild bubble,

3218
01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:25.721
you know?

3219
01:14:25.721 --> 01:14:26.840
And I just follow with what,

3220
01:14:26.841 --> 01:14:28.900
what are the goals or could be.

3221
01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:29.743
It could be,

3222
01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:31.240
it could be anything just out.

3223
01:14:31.330 --> 01:14:32.440
I like to be outdoors.

3224
01:14:32.710 --> 01:14:37.710
Even if it's like 10 minus degrees or if it's summertime,

3225
01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:39.240
I'm all,

3226
01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:40.270
I'm out all the time.

3227
01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:41.470
That's awesome.

3228
01:14:41.470 --> 01:14:44.560
That's a great way to put things in perspective too.

3229
01:14:44.561 --> 01:14:45.280
Right.

3230
01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:46.390
And the guy is telling me,

3231
01:14:46.510 --> 01:14:47.050
they're like,

3232
01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:50.950
if you put that much time being like you're doing in hunting,

3233
01:14:51.190 --> 01:14:52.990
he did that in training or B,

3234
01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:53.891
not time,

3235
01:14:53.891 --> 01:14:55.850
but just having that interest.

3236
01:14:56.230 --> 01:14:56.970
Yeah.

3237
01:14:56.970 --> 01:14:57.271
You know,

3238
01:14:57.271 --> 01:14:57.401
they,

3239
01:14:57.401 --> 01:14:57.661
they,

3240
01:14:57.661 --> 01:14:59.380
they all the time telling me that.

3241
01:14:59.381 --> 01:15:01.240
So those interests,

3242
01:15:01.241 --> 01:15:03.790
things like hunting or a relief for your mind.

3243
01:15:03.970 --> 01:15:04.840
But it is,

3244
01:15:04.930 --> 01:15:05.181
it is.

3245
01:15:05.181 --> 01:15:06.014
And I wish,

3246
01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:09.460
I wish everybody could see that it's a healthy way of living.

3247
01:15:09.461 --> 01:15:10.260
I think.

3248
01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:10.770
Yes.

3249
01:15:10.770 --> 01:15:11.590
I think,

3250
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:12.121
I think for,

3251
01:15:12.121 --> 01:15:14.860
especially to a guy who has such an intense pursuit,

3252
01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:19.390
it's probably good to have another thing that you're interested in so that it

3253
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:23.920
gives you like a relief from not always thinking about fighting all the time.

3254
01:15:23.921 --> 01:15:25.030
And then there's a break.

3255
01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:27.970
Cause it's obviously hunting's not competitive.

3256
01:15:28.270 --> 01:15:31.270
So what you're doing when you're hunting is more primal,

3257
01:15:31.271 --> 01:15:31.841
natural,

3258
01:15:31.841 --> 01:15:34.450
but also very difficult and time consuming.

3259
01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:35.410
Yeah.

3260
01:15:35.410 --> 01:15:37.560
Because it's like you,

3261
01:15:37.561 --> 01:15:37.751
you,

3262
01:15:37.751 --> 01:15:37.931
you,

3263
01:15:37.931 --> 01:15:38.471
you train,

3264
01:15:38.471 --> 01:15:38.711
you,

3265
01:15:38.711 --> 01:15:38.821
you,

3266
01:15:38.821 --> 01:15:40.000
you compete at the gym,

3267
01:15:40.001 --> 01:15:40.750
you compete in the,

3268
01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:41.680
in the octagon.

3269
01:15:41.681 --> 01:15:42.081
You,

3270
01:15:42.081 --> 01:15:44.050
you're competing in business,

3271
01:15:44.051 --> 01:15:44.861
you're competing in,

3272
01:15:44.861 --> 01:15:46.810
everything is just a competitive way of,

3273
01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:49.210
as you leave a competitive way,

3274
01:15:49.390 --> 01:15:50.223
way.

3275
01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:52.090
It's a competitor way of living basically.

3276
01:15:52.091 --> 01:15:52.381
And,

3277
01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:53.214
and uh,

3278
01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:55.390
it gets a toll on you after awhile.

3279
01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:56.320
And then when I was,

3280
01:15:56.321 --> 01:15:56.981
when I was young,

3281
01:15:56.981 --> 01:15:57.820
when I started this sport,

3282
01:15:57.821 --> 01:15:58.654
I was just,

3283
01:15:58.780 --> 01:15:59.550
and I was,

3284
01:15:59.550 --> 01:15:59.741
you know,

3285
01:15:59.741 --> 01:16:00.460
I was just like,

3286
01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:01.780
I want it to smash everybody.

3287
01:16:02.010 --> 01:16:05.820
The Gym all bomb it all.

3288
01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:06.663
But now,

3289
01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:07.600
you know,

3290
01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:08.710
nowadays I'm like,

3291
01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:10.780
I know my bed and my body bet.

3292
01:16:10.781 --> 01:16:12.070
I know what my buddy needs.

3293
01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:12.820
Uh,

3294
01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:13.011
I,

3295
01:16:13.011 --> 01:16:13.630
I know,

3296
01:16:13.630 --> 01:16:13.901
okay,

3297
01:16:13.901 --> 01:16:14.560
this is,

3298
01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:17.180
I found a way where I even,

3299
01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:20.170
even if I was doing what I was doing six,

3300
01:16:20.171 --> 01:16:21.190
seven years ago,

3301
01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:22.370
I,

3302
01:16:22.370 --> 01:16:22.960
I wouldn't,

3303
01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:24.890
I wouldn't even if I offended duty,

3304
01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:25.080
the,

3305
01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.500
in training wise,

3306
01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:30.580
being such a nerd in training and just training,

3307
01:16:30.581 --> 01:16:33.070
training seven days a week,

3308
01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:34.300
24 hours a day,

3309
01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:36.760
I wouldn't be a better competitor.

3310
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:38.860
I wouldn't do better in fights.

3311
01:16:39.730 --> 01:16:41.350
Now are found a way of,

3312
01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:43.060
I basically found a way,

3313
01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:43.511
okay,

3314
01:16:43.511 --> 01:16:44.780
this is what I need to,

3315
01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:49.800
to make my life better and make my competition better.

3316
01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:52.030
I performed much better doing this.

3317
01:16:52.031 --> 01:16:55.090
I perform a perform much better having that distance from,

3318
01:16:55.091 --> 01:16:55.750
from,

3319
01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:57.130
from all that competitive,

3320
01:16:57.650 --> 01:16:57.940
uh,

3321
01:16:57.940 --> 01:16:58.481
things.

3322
01:16:58.481 --> 01:16:58.841
Uh,

3323
01:16:58.841 --> 01:16:58.971
and,

3324
01:16:58.971 --> 01:16:59.501
and,

3325
01:16:59.501 --> 01:17:00.334
uh,

3326
01:17:00.910 --> 01:17:01.743
so yeah,

3327
01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:02.613
I need it now.

3328
01:17:03.050 --> 01:17:03.883
I know.

3329
01:17:04.030 --> 01:17:06.100
So where are you stand right now?

3330
01:17:06.130 --> 01:17:07.000
You're healed up,

3331
01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:08.170
you're ready to go.

3332
01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:09.033
Do you just sit,

3333
01:17:09.170 --> 01:17:10.160
wait for a call?

3334
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:13.610
<v 0>Your manager informs the UFC that you're ready to go into camp.</v>

3335
01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:15.690
<v 3>Okay.</v>

3336
01:17:15.690 --> 01:17:15.901
<v 1>I'm,</v>

3337
01:17:15.901 --> 01:17:16.620
I'm ready.

3338
01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:17.160
I'm ready.

3339
01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:17.993
I'm ready to,

3340
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.080
I'm ready to go in camp.

3341
01:17:19.081 --> 01:17:20.310
I'm training right now.

3342
01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:21.273
Um,

3343
01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:22.583
I'm healed up.

3344
01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:23.850
I'm hundred percent.

3345
01:17:24.030 --> 01:17:24.241
So,

3346
01:17:24.241 --> 01:17:25.140
but how does that work?

3347
01:17:25.180 --> 01:17:25.720
<v 0>Do you,</v>

3348
01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:29.800
do you contact the UFC and try to negotiate something to try to get something

3349
01:17:29.801 --> 01:17:30.080
going?

3350
01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:34.090
Do you wait for them to contact you or do you wait for this steep Emile chick a

3351
01:17:34.091 --> 01:17:34.924
DC fight?

3352
01:17:36.290 --> 01:17:39.950
<v 1>Basically I just waiting for them to come with something that makes sense for</v>

3353
01:17:40.130 --> 01:17:40.430
me.

3354
01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:42.110
And so there's been no discussion so far?

3355
01:17:43.290 --> 01:17:43.790
No.

3356
01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:44.623
No,

3357
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:45.200
not really.

3358
01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:45.621
Not really.

3359
01:17:45.621 --> 01:17:46.340
No.

3360
01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:47.840
That's gotta be kind of frustrating.

3361
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.310
Yeah.

3362
01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:48.770
You know,

3363
01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:50.180
it's been some discussions,

3364
01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:50.660
uh,

3365
01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:50.961
but,

3366
01:17:50.961 --> 01:17:52.430
but nothing that really,

3367
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.190
no,

3368
01:17:54.190 --> 01:17:55.350
nothing that really,

3369
01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:57.380
uh,

3370
01:17:57.380 --> 01:17:59.930
nothing that really account on or anything like that.

3371
01:17:59.931 --> 01:18:04.640
It's just been just been up in the air and I'm just waiting for something on the

3372
01:18:04.641 --> 01:18:05.420
table.

3373
01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:06.470
That makes sense.

3374
01:18:07.010 --> 01:18:07.460
Um,

3375
01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:08.111
I'm ready to go,

3376
01:18:08.111 --> 01:18:08.400
man.

3377
01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:11.840
<v 0>So what would make sense other than Jon Jones other than DC?</v>

3378
01:18:11.850 --> 01:18:14.490
What would make sense you as the number one contender right now,

3379
01:18:14.491 --> 01:18:16.980
John's on ranked because right now he's currently suspended,

3380
01:18:16.981 --> 01:18:18.270
but as soon as they put him back in,

3381
01:18:18.271 --> 01:18:19.770
he's likely to be right up there with you.

3382
01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:21.030
And then you have DC.

3383
01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:24.240
I mean who else in your division makes any sense now?

3384
01:18:24.270 --> 01:18:27.360
They were to offer you a fight now of John Jones is going to be suspended still

3385
01:18:27.361 --> 01:18:29.150
for another six months or whatever it's going to be.

3386
01:18:30.730 --> 01:18:34.480
Who makes sense in your division for you other than DC?

3387
01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:35.710
<v 1>What?</v>

3388
01:18:35.710 --> 01:18:37.800
I wish I had an answer to that right now,

3389
01:18:37.801 --> 01:18:38.181
but I,

3390
01:18:38.181 --> 01:18:39.014
I really don't.

3391
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:40.183
I just,

3392
01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:40.771
you know,

3393
01:18:40.771 --> 01:18:42.030
I just feel like it has to be,

3394
01:18:42.090 --> 01:18:43.980
it has to be on unmeaningful offer.

3395
01:18:43.981 --> 01:18:45.900
It has to be something that I feel this is strike,

3396
01:18:45.930 --> 01:18:47.450
this is this is what I,

3397
01:18:47.490 --> 01:18:48.180
what I want.

3398
01:18:48.180 --> 01:18:50.490
I feel like man,

3399
01:18:50.530 --> 01:18:53.460
in my position in my career right now,

3400
01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:58.520
every fight I refine it has to mean something and I'm getting at is with you at

3401
01:18:58.801 --> 01:18:59.400
the top.

3402
01:18:59.400 --> 01:18:59.551
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

3403
01:18:59.551 --> 01:19:02.650
Really the fight to make is one of two D C or John.

3404
01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:03.800
Those are the two fights.

3405
01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:04.130
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

3406
01:19:04.130 --> 01:19:04.461
Or,

3407
01:19:04.461 --> 01:19:06.900
or it could be something else to Joe.

3408
01:19:06.910 --> 01:19:07.701
But it has to be,

3409
01:19:07.701 --> 01:19:08.534
it has to be,

3410
01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:10.930
has to fit right though.

3411
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:11.721
It has to fit right.

3412
01:19:11.721 --> 01:19:11.961
And,

3413
01:19:11.961 --> 01:19:12.411
and,

3414
01:19:12.411 --> 01:19:12.591
uh,

3415
01:19:12.591 --> 01:19:13.320
it has to be,

3416
01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:14.870
has to be something meaningful,

3417
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:18.200
like a big main event on Fox or something like that.

3418
01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:21.800
Something where it's a big fight to showcase something good.

3419
01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:22.873
And,

3420
01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:23.510
you know,

3421
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:25.420
everybody knows that when I'm stepping up in that octagon,

3422
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:29.450
I'm going to perform and I'm going to make a show and I'm looking for that goal.

3423
01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:30.433
That's all I'm saying.

3424
01:19:31.090 --> 01:19:31.211
<v 0>Well,</v>

3425
01:19:31.211 --> 01:19:31.511
listen,

3426
01:19:31.511 --> 01:19:32.010
man,

3427
01:19:32.010 --> 01:19:32.560
uh,

3428
01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:33.460
I'm a fan.

3429
01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:35.650
It's been a pleasure to be able to commentate your fights.

3430
01:19:35.651 --> 01:19:37.000
I really enjoy watching fight.

3431
01:19:37.001 --> 01:19:39.640
I really enjoy watch you develop the whole process.

3432
01:19:39.641 --> 01:19:39.971
And,

3433
01:19:39.971 --> 01:19:40.120
uh,

3434
01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:41.380
I really appreciate you coming on here,

3435
01:19:41.381 --> 01:19:42.020
man.

3436
01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:43.320
Appreciate it.

3437
01:19:44.510 --> 01:19:45.250
Good luck to you.

3438
01:19:45.250 --> 01:19:46.083
I appreciate that.

3439
01:19:46.210 --> 01:19:47.590
The mauler ladies and gentlemen.

3440
01:19:54.530 --> 01:19:54.650
<v 3>Hm.</v>
