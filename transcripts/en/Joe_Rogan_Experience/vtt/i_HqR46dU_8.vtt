28
00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:41.610
<v Speaker 1>whether it's books or radio shows like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opiate Anthony show,</v>

29
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.480
<v Speaker 1>I believe they have some podcasts on</v>
<v Speaker 1>there as well that we thought they had</v>

30
00:01:45.481 --> 00:01:47.640
<v Speaker 1>Dan Carlin's podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we were mistaken.</v>

31
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.440
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to Dan about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

32
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:50.700
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just making that shit up.</v>

33
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.500
<v Speaker 1>I love that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a great guy,</v>

34
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.400
<v Speaker 1>and he's a great guy.</v>

35
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.280
<v Speaker 1>If you listened to his podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll like him even more.</v>

36
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.310
<v Speaker 1>Once you listen to the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you really liked the guy because</v>

37
00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:00.360
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

38
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.980
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's like,</v>

39
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.080
<v Speaker 1>he's making a masterpiece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

40
00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:06.420
<v Speaker 1>what we're doing is just sitting around</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking shit.</v>

41
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.580
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that you guys enjoy it.</v>

42
00:02:08.581 --> 00:02:11.460
<v Speaker 1>But the amount of effort that goes into</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing one of these,</v>

43
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.620
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

44
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so tiny compared to what he's</v>

45
00:02:16.141 --> 00:02:18.870
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's essentially doing a real audio book</v>

46
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.220
<v Speaker 1>every time he released as a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it takes a few weeks to put each one</v>

47
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:25.320
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're masterpieces and the,</v>

48
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.420
<v Speaker 1>he's so dramatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it makes,</v>

49
00:02:27.421 --> 00:02:30.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes listening to history exciting.</v>

50
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of fucking cool books</v>

51
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.200
<v Speaker 1>that they have on audible.com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a plethora over 100,000</v>

52
00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:41.890
<v Speaker 1>different titles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They even have standup comedy.</v>

53
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.530
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know they have some of my shit up</v>

54
00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:44.120
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

57
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.350
<v Speaker 1>what book is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that,</v>

58
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.650
<v Speaker 1>I've heard of this before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

59
00:02:51.651 --> 00:02:54.690
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the war with like in a hundred</v>

60
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.280
<v Speaker 1>years into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really good.</v>

61
00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 1>It's a 20 it's 20 years old is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

62
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.170
<v Speaker 1>20 years ago was not that long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How weird is that?</v>

63
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 1>I see coming out about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think 20 years ago it was like,</v>

64
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:06.370
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so long ago.</v>

65
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.810
<v Speaker 1>And when you were a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like God,</v>

66
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.650
<v Speaker 1>20 years ago it was the 19th sixties</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

67
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how ridiculous is that?</v>

68
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.350
<v Speaker 1>And then you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

69
00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:16.630
<v Speaker 1>that shit happens rather quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

70
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.650
<v Speaker 1>Which is really weird when you wrap your</v>
<v Speaker 1>head around it and you think from 1950</v>

71
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 1>to 2013 how different shit is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's something,</v>

72
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>63 years,</v>

73
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.610
<v Speaker 1>August is on my sleeve over.</v>

74
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.960
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem like it was just August</v>
<v Speaker 1>two times.</v>

75
00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:30.760
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does this Ender's game?</v>

76
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.350
<v Speaker 1>This is there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're making it into a book.</v>

77
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.280
<v Speaker 1>This is an audible book off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're also making it interesting</v>

78
00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:36.820
<v Speaker 1>to me and making it into a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

79
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 1>the beautiful thing about all ball is</v>
<v Speaker 1>for fucking traffic.</v>

80
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.820
<v Speaker 1>And if you're on a plane or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

81
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:44.230
<v Speaker 1>if you don't want to listen to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>

82
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.430
<v Speaker 1>if you don't want to listen to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a great way to go and over a</v>

<v Speaker 1>hundred thousand different titles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you go to audible.com um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>to say with audible.</v>

88
00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:04.210
<v Speaker 1>Squarespace is a confusing one because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want the number afterwards.</v>

89
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:07.930
<v Speaker 1>Went Joe Eight to track the month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think audible.com you just go to</v>

<v Speaker 1>They also support standup comedy.</v>

97
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.700
<v Speaker 1>They even had a live thing where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were doing every week.</v>

98
00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:34.270
<v Speaker 1>People would do like a new five minutes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shit didn't really work out because</v>

99
00:04:34.271 --> 00:04:36.580
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of fucking time to come up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with in five weeks.</v>

100
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.910
<v Speaker 1>People don't like to think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to have like a rock solid five new</v>

101
00:04:39.911 --> 00:04:42.970
<v Speaker 1>minutes every week that you're really</v>
<v Speaker 1>proud of that you'd want to put online.</v>

102
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.400
<v Speaker 1>That's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

103
00:04:45.401 --> 00:04:48.430
<v Speaker 1>So Steve Marmel was doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was doing that every week.</v>

104
00:04:48.431 --> 00:04:50.710
<v Speaker 1>I remember the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had a contract with him and a</v>

105
00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:52.510
<v Speaker 1>couple other dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

106
00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:55.660
<v Speaker 1>Marmel is real topical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he was like trying to like just</v>

107
00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:59.600
<v Speaker 1>constantly right topical jokes about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Funny Shit that's happening in the news</v>

108
00:04:59.601 --> 00:05:00.434
<v Speaker 1>or what have you.</v>

109
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.070
<v Speaker 1>But it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking burn it off.</v>

110
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.780
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of time.</v>

111
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.900
<v Speaker 1>That's too hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean you could do it,</v>

112
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.260
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be on the ball every day if</v>

113
00:05:11.261 --> 00:05:13.390
<v Speaker 1>you want it to really truly represent</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

114
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.260
<v Speaker 1>So I think they stopped doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they have earth by a John Stewart</v>

<v Speaker 1>She's a very funny person.</v>

126
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.870

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.470
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you fuck with Joan Rivers.</v>

135
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.670

<v Speaker 1>and the girl you like dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She ripped some some fucking stages too.</v>

174
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.930
<v Speaker 1>What's a chick on channel five every</v>
<v Speaker 1>day?</v>

175
00:07:54.931 --> 00:07:59.670
<v Speaker 1>The one that seen me at the bus stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the lesbian chick that singing on</v>

176
00:07:59.671 --> 00:08:01.740
<v Speaker 1>the bus stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You went on his show the other day.</v>

177
00:08:01.741 --> 00:08:03.240
<v Speaker 1>You were looking for tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

178
00:08:03.241 --> 00:08:05.550
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about that chick Ellen</v>
<v Speaker 1>degenerate.</v>

179
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mother fuckers that rip it up.</v>

180
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:13.440
<v Speaker 1>Paula Poundstone rip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but chick from the comedy store,</v>

181
00:08:13.441 --> 00:08:15.290
<v Speaker 1>the one that was in with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them,</v>

182
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.580
<v Speaker 1>they smoked a joint with the chick with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking big fits.</v>

183
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.440
<v Speaker 1>But Lily Tomlin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she used to rip up the phone.</v>

184
00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.750
<v Speaker 1>She had like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>one woman show.</v>

185
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:25.741
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

186
00:08:25.741 --> 00:08:26.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

187
00:08:26.551 --> 00:08:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Sarah Silverman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's right up there.</v>

188
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:31.080
<v Speaker 1>I think she's at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go top ones of all time.</v>

189
00:08:31.081 --> 00:08:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Rivers with a strong Roseanne kicking</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck.</v>

190
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:38.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might five Roseanne might've been</v>

191
00:08:38.551 --> 00:08:42.420
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like has her delivery man.</v>

192
00:08:42.421 --> 00:08:44.250
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking hard.</v>

193
00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Very hard because [inaudible] rivers is</v>
<v Speaker 1>still out there swinging.</v>

194
00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.050
<v Speaker 1>So in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you got to give her a number one</v>

195
00:08:52.051 --> 00:08:54.300
<v Speaker 1>cause she's still swinging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

196
00:08:54.301 --> 00:08:55.560
<v Speaker 1>she's still there doing</v>

197
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.460
<v Speaker 4>cards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when they asked her,</v>

198
00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.110
<v Speaker 4>she was on the wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's one of the funniest things.</v>

199
00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:05.370
<v Speaker 4>He's pretty gangster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He asked if she was in the wrestler.</v>

200
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.650
<v Speaker 4>I almost fucking died when I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

201
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:09.550
<v Speaker 4>I think it's harder for a woman to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>stand up.</v>

202
00:09:09.551 --> 00:09:10.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm always,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

203
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.100
<v Speaker 4>I think that men are sexist for the most</v>
<v Speaker 4>part.</v>

204
00:09:14.101 --> 00:09:16.830
<v Speaker 4>And they don't want to listen to a woman</v>
<v Speaker 4>talk.</v>

205
00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.990
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's harder to get a lot of</v>

206
00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:21.960
<v Speaker 4>men's attention and obviously that's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>big generalization because there's a lot</v>

207
00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:25.260
<v Speaker 4>of Sarah Silverman fans from men are a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of women fans of comedy.</v>

208
00:09:25.261 --> 00:09:26.240
<v Speaker 4>There are men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

209
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:29.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>featuring I cheer for women when they're</v>

210
00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:34.560
<v Speaker 4>free trade and I love motherfuckers who</v>
<v Speaker 4>go on stage headlining and think they're</v>

211
00:09:34.561 --> 00:09:36.420
<v Speaker 4>going to follow a woman on a Saturday</v>
<v Speaker 4>night.</v>

212
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:39.140
<v Speaker 4>Your shit better be tight because of</v>
<v Speaker 4>this chicken.</v>

259
00:11:42.271 --> 00:11:44.820
<v Speaker 4>off the fucking pot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They only had about three or four weeks</v>

260
00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:49.110
<v Speaker 4>to adjust to that style of comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you would see them go away on their</v>

261
00:11:49.111 --> 00:11:52.970
<v Speaker 4>own because it's six guys before you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you got to go up there with your</v>

<v Speaker 1>store.</v>

<v Speaker 1>rang a tiny charity organization.</v>

404
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:30.410
<v Speaker 1>So whatever this organization is called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's unfair.</v>

405
00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.890
<v Speaker 1>It's unclear here on this email.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just read it what it says and</v>

406
00:17:33.891 --> 00:17:34.340
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:35.600
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll figure it out together.</v>

408
00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:39.050
<v Speaker 1>It says we launched the orangutan primal</v>
<v Speaker 1>bell and have linked it to an orangutan</v>

409
00:17:39.051 --> 00:17:42.950
<v Speaker 1>charity organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every purchase donates $5 to save the</v>

410
00:17:42.951 --> 00:17:44.840
<v Speaker 1>red ape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't if save the red ape is the name</v>

411
00:17:44.841 --> 00:17:48.080
<v Speaker 1>of the organization or there's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>organization that's not named that's</v>

412
00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:51.360
<v Speaker 1>unclear to me and that statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would just be clear about that.</v>

413
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.660
<v Speaker 1>But the idea is that every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for every one of these orangutan</v>

414
00:17:54.661 --> 00:17:56.310
<v Speaker 1>kettlebells,</v>

<v Speaker 4>The open mic with the kid who died,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kevin Fitzgerald or whatever his name</v>

475
00:20:21.401 --> 00:20:23.170

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:25.750
<v Speaker 4>Kevin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was friends with our friend Maguire.</v>

<v Speaker 4>They introduced me to him.</v>

<v Speaker 4>do and Dover the WHO and I was never</v>

480
00:20:37.511 --> 00:20:40.630
<v Speaker 4>good enough to play Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would get to do the collection on</v>

00:20:40.631 --> 00:20:43.180
<v Speaker 4>Monday nights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's like having a fucking</v>

482
00:20:43.181 --> 00:20:47.020
<v Speaker 4>striping comedy when you get to play</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boston and they accept you into that.</v>

483
00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I knew before I went to Boston that</v>

488
00:20:57.341 --> 00:20:59.380

509
00:21:47.351 --> 00:21:50.200

<v Speaker 4>A nice gate kid that went to Chris</v>

510
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.820
<v Speaker 4>Mcguire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his house that he'd done it and your</v>

511
00:21:51.821 --> 00:21:54.730
<v Speaker 4>name came up and there was two gay guys</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the table and they go,</v>

512
00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:56.560
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't like Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

513
00:21:56.561 --> 00:21:57.394
<v Speaker 4>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

514
00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:02.670
<v Speaker 4>he called Princess Diana [inaudible].</v>

515
00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.070
<v Speaker 4>They all went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God.</v>

516
00:22:06.071 --> 00:22:08.350
<v Speaker 4>It was horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>

517
00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:11.560
<v Speaker 4>Those were great times when those guys</v>
<v Speaker 4>from Boston took me and they would take</v>

518
00:22:11.561 --> 00:22:14.470
<v Speaker 4>me up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then I went to San Jose,</v>

519
00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:18.910
<v Speaker 4>then I went to DC and that was really</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first time I used to do like</v>

520
00:22:18.911 --> 00:22:22.960
<v Speaker 4>headliners and Tysons corner for years I</v>
<v Speaker 4>used to fly into Dallas.</v>

521
00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.530
<v Speaker 4>This is the first time I was in the city</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was an experience because I tell</v>

522
00:22:26.531 --> 00:22:28.000
<v Speaker 4>you what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I would've gone five years ago,</v>

523
00:22:28.001 --> 00:22:29.320
<v Speaker 4>guys that would have bombed this</v>
<v Speaker 4>weekend.</v>

524
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:31.210
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why you say that?</v>

525
00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:35.140
<v Speaker 4>Because I learned how to control more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

526
00:22:35.141 --> 00:22:36.490
<v Speaker 4>you learn and calm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

527
00:22:36.491 --> 00:22:39.190
<v Speaker 4>it's so funny how we put ourselves out</v>
<v Speaker 4>there where you never did.</v>

528
00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:41.650
<v Speaker 4>I didn't have a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were telling me to ask me the</v>

529
00:22:41.651 --> 00:22:43.360
<v Speaker 4>headline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would go up there with stupid fucking</v>

530
00:22:43.361 --> 00:22:46.390
<v Speaker 4>jokes and you would headline and you'd</v>
<v Speaker 4>have the time,</v>

531
00:22:46.391 --> 00:22:48.730
<v Speaker 4>but you really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you weren't really a headliner.</v>

532
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:52.180
<v Speaker 4>And it's true when people start to come</v>
<v Speaker 4>to see you,</v>

533
00:22:52.181 --> 00:22:55.480
<v Speaker 4>it makes you work a little harder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like every time you see him you want to</v>

534
00:22:55.481 --> 00:22:59.300
<v Speaker 4>have new material or new float floaty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I had never been there and I,</v>

535
00:22:59.301 --> 00:23:02.020
<v Speaker 4>and I sharpened up this week and I went</v>
<v Speaker 4>there and I tell you they were very</v>

536
00:23:02.021 --> 00:23:05.410
<v Speaker 4>politically correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The city of DC downtown.</v>

537
00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.410

<v Speaker 4>it's a nation's fucking capital.</v>

538
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:11.550

<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about weed and it might not</v>

<v Speaker 1>The sex industry closed down because of</v>

710
00:30:10.331 --> 00:30:11.480
<v Speaker 1>AIDS again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here and the chick that,</v>

712
00:30:13.091 --> 00:30:14.560
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Boehner Guy,</v>

713
00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:15.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that chicken out.</v>

714
00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:17.320
<v Speaker 1>We did a porn with wiener.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

715
00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:19.390
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Wiener politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

716
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:20.590
<v Speaker 1>She uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

717
00:30:20.591 --> 00:30:23.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did a movie with a guy that I read that</v>

718
00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:26.050
<v Speaker 1>she did well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy was exposed to HIV.</v>

719
00:30:26.051 --> 00:30:29.260
<v Speaker 1>He had sex with the girl who had</v>
<v Speaker 1>contacted HIV.</v>

720
00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:30.310
<v Speaker 1>He had sex with her.</v>

721
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:35.310
<v Speaker 1>But allegedly from what I've read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that easy to transmit from HIV,</v>

722
00:30:36.881 --> 00:30:41.380
<v Speaker 1>from a woman to a man that it's much</v>
<v Speaker 1>easier for a man to a woman because of</v>

723
00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:44.680
<v Speaker 1>the man and checks fluids into the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know if that's true though.</v>

724
00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Obviously I'm not a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like a Tommy Morrison is a,</v>

725
00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:54.070
<v Speaker 1>supposedly it really sick with AIDS now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he has full blown aids and they did</v>

726
00:30:54.071 --> 00:30:57.520
<v Speaker 1>a story about it recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody posted it on the underground</v>

727
00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:00.100
<v Speaker 1>and it was really fucking sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's dying.</v>

728
00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:02.320
<v Speaker 1>He's on like life support system</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>

729
00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.540
<v Speaker 1>He has full blown aids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

730
00:31:04.541 --> 00:31:08.140
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say he got it from a girl,</v>

731
00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:10.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

732
00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:12.100
<v Speaker 1>it might be possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not know.</v>

733
00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:15.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard like obviously that's what</v>

734
00:31:15.491 --> 00:31:17.680
<v Speaker 1>you always hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not possible for a guy to get it</v>

735
00:31:17.681 --> 00:31:18.070
<v Speaker 1>from a girl.</v>

736
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:20.920
<v Speaker 1>You always hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know if that's anything</v>

737
00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:21.880
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll let you put it.</v>

738
00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:23.670
<v Speaker 1>It got it from a needle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could've got it from an email.</v>

739
00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:26.350
<v Speaker 1>That's the obvious fucking choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

740
00:31:26.351 --> 00:31:29.620
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about that a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday we thought Dwayne Twain</v>

741
00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:32.410
<v Speaker 1>Ludwig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about fighters and pills</v>

742
00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:36.760
<v Speaker 1>and a pain relief and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking would leave relieves pain better</v>

743
00:31:36.761 --> 00:31:37.481
<v Speaker 1>than heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

744
00:31:37.481 --> 00:31:38.314
<v Speaker 1>he's right.</v>

745
00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

746
00:31:40.391 --> 00:31:42.340
<v Speaker 1>started shooting up because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the heroin,</v>

747
00:31:42.341 --> 00:31:45.730
<v Speaker 1>like relieving the pain for them was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was so effective.</v>

748
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:46.990
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do it that way.</v>

00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:49.050
<v Speaker 1>Those opiates,</v>

<v Speaker 1>used to getting punched in the face,</v>

00:32:04.781 --> 00:32:08.050
<v Speaker 1>going back out there to fight of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>two fucking rounds at three fucking</v>

756
00:32:08.051 --> 00:32:08.410
<v Speaker 1>round.</v>

<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

759
00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see that with Tommy</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morrison?</v>

760
00:32:16.481 --> 00:32:19.270
<v Speaker 1>Getting knocked out by Ray Marshall is</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most frightening knockouts</v>

761
00:32:19.271 --> 00:32:21.730
<v Speaker 1>I've ever seen in my life because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

762
00:32:21.731 --> 00:32:24.220
<v Speaker 1>first of all it's frightening because</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ray Marshall was a murderous puncher,</v>

763
00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:29.020
<v Speaker 1>but it was hilarious for me because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>had this friend that would always root</v>

764
00:32:29.021 --> 00:32:31.930
<v Speaker 1>for white guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking,</v>

765
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:35.260
<v Speaker 1>oh he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wanted white guys to win boxing</v>

766
00:32:35.261 --> 00:32:37.840
<v Speaker 1>ranches so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never wanted it to be the best</v>

767
00:32:37.841 --> 00:32:39.830
<v Speaker 1>fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He always wanted it to be white fighter.</v>

768
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:45.250
<v Speaker 4>So like he rooted for Cherry Cooney and</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he got hit here and Raymar so just</v>

769
00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:47.030
<v Speaker 4>unloads on him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

770
00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:50.570
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's who gets caught in the ropes</v>

771
00:32:50.571 --> 00:32:51.410
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at this.</v>

772
00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:54.280
<v Speaker 4>Like he's caught in the robes and ray</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mars is teeing off them.</v>

773
00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:57.850
<v Speaker 4>That's terrible qualities is a better</v>
<v Speaker 4>quality version that we could see it</v>

774
00:32:57.851 --> 00:33:00.560
<v Speaker 4>smooth because it was real so choppy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>

775
00:33:00.561 --> 00:33:01.820
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a frightening,</v>

776
00:33:01.821 --> 00:33:04.010
<v Speaker 4>frightening knock out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But once you've done that,</v>

777
00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:09.200
<v Speaker 4>you could shoot heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's 235 PA listen pro that that once</v>

<v Speaker 4>fucking go away and that little needle</v>

<v Speaker 4>Listen to all those people stories.</v>

780
00:33:16.701 --> 00:33:20.930
<v Speaker 4>That's how it started and that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>started launching the rookies behind you</v>

1065
00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:07.210

<v Speaker 1>What were they thinking?</v>

1066
00:46:07.211 --> 00:46:08.740
<v Speaker 1>Building houses there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1067
00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:12.070
<v Speaker 1>that's like beautiful for most of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1068
00:46:13.090 --> 00:46:16.420
<v Speaker 1>but fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's a possibility,</v>

1069
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:19.270
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't matter if you were right</v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of the water with this</v>

1070
00:46:19.271 --> 00:46:20.051
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1071
00:46:20.051 --> 00:46:25.051
<v Speaker 1>Like they went like several blocks in</v>
<v Speaker 1>just destroying everything in its path.</v>

1072
00:46:26.590 --> 00:46:29.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like we're so crazy to think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oceans are going to stay where it</v>

1073
00:46:29.621 --> 00:46:32.650
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did nutty idea to like build</v>

1074
00:46:32.651 --> 00:46:35.320
<v Speaker 1>expensive shit right next to the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like tennis.</v>

1075
00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.060
<v Speaker 1>The edge is right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is my spot.</v>

1076
00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:39.850
<v Speaker 1>Fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got marked it off.</v>

1077
00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:44.170
<v Speaker 1>This is my house I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm up on stilts and only put the house</v>

1078
00:46:44.171 --> 00:46:48.370
<v Speaker 1>right right at the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like the gamble is like,</v>

1079
00:46:48.610 --> 00:46:52.140
<v Speaker 1>how long is the water going to be there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it going to stay there for a hundred</v>

1080
00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:53.770
<v Speaker 1>years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Going to stay for 50 years?</v>

1081
00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:55.330
<v Speaker 1>What's the gamble?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1082
00:46:55.331 --> 00:46:58.120
<v Speaker 1>And everybody's willing to take that</v>
<v Speaker 1>gamble because if you can open up your</v>

1083
00:46:58.121 --> 00:47:00.670
<v Speaker 1>window and you're there on the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's boat,</v>

1084
00:47:00.671 --> 00:47:03.730
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1085
00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:08.580
<v Speaker 1>So they take that gamble parked that</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch right next to the rocks and the</v>

1086
00:47:08.581 --> 00:47:10.040
<v Speaker 1>hope that nothing melts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1087
00:47:10.041 --> 00:47:12.620
<v Speaker 1>but you'd have a bigger gamble having a</v>
<v Speaker 1>house on a mountain like,</v>

1088
00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:14.950
<v Speaker 1>like with the fires that you had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

1089
00:47:14.951 --> 00:47:16.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight fires are everywhere in</v>

1090
00:47:16.871 --> 00:47:17.760
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1091
00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:22.660
<v Speaker 1>I talked to a firefighter that said</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a real worry and not of if,</v>

1092
00:47:22.661 --> 00:47:26.680
<v Speaker 1>but when the one day one of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker wildfires that they get is</v>

1093
00:47:26.681 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 1>going to catch La and the wind's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>be just right and he</v>

1094
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.350
<v Speaker 6>said it's gonna burn right to the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I go,</v>

1095
00:47:32.351 --> 00:47:33.940
<v Speaker 6>you think it will burn down Hollywood?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

1096
00:47:33.941 --> 00:47:35.800
<v Speaker 6>I don't think we can stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

1097
00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:40.820
<v Speaker 6>if you're dealing with the kind of fire</v>
<v Speaker 6>that can go that far and is is that</v>

1098
00:47:41.891 --> 00:47:46.720
<v Speaker 6>strong and it's wind aided and it's just</v>
<v Speaker 6>big enough cause fires can be really,</v>

1099
00:47:46.721 --> 00:47:48.550
<v Speaker 6>really,</v>
<v Speaker 6>really fucking big.</v>

1100
00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:51.430
<v Speaker 6>You know it's hard to wrap your head</v>
<v Speaker 6>around how big they can be,</v>

1101
00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:54.130
<v Speaker 6>but they can be so big that you can't</v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking control them.</v>

1102
00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:56.860
<v Speaker 6>All you do is try to contain them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you can't control them.</v>

1103
00:47:57.220 --> 00:48:01.330
<v Speaker 6>And if they get that big and they can't</v>
<v Speaker 6>cut it off in time and it starts going</v>

1104
00:48:01.331 --> 00:48:04.360
<v Speaker 6>towards La,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if it's the right time of year,</v>

1105
00:48:04.361 --> 00:48:06.640
<v Speaker 6>the right amount of Santa Ana winds</v>
<v Speaker 6>kicking in.</v>

1106
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:08.260
<v Speaker 6>Shit man,</v>

1107
00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:10.700
<v Speaker 4>look what happened last year in New</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jersey.</v>

1108
00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:11.700

1109
00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:13.490
<v Speaker 6>Could good happening right now in</v>
<v Speaker 6>Montana.</v>

1110

<v Speaker 4>fucking scary as shit all over the world</v>

1113
00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:29.560

<v Speaker 4>with a man to when the shit and listen,</v>

1114

<v Speaker 4>Everything's getting more fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>extreme brother.</v>

1116
00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:37.240
<v Speaker 4>The heat's getting more extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cold is getting more extreme.</v>

1117
00:48:37.241 --> 00:48:39.100
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not fucking Hell Gore.</v>

1118
00:48:39.610 --> 00:48:41.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm not gonna sit here and tell you</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not shit.</v>

1119
00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:43.710
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was over.</v>

1120
00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:45.690
<v Speaker 4>You didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1121
00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:48.190
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the fuck's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we evolve.</v>

1122
00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:50.410
<v Speaker 4>So that means the weather has to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>evolve.</v>

1123
00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:53.440
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 years ago I remember being in Jersey,</v>

1124
00:48:53.441 --> 00:48:55.340
<v Speaker 4>hanging out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>playing wiffle ball and what did it,</v>

1125
00:48:55.341 --> 00:48:58.830
<v Speaker 4>three minutes it would get dark dog and</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden have these chunks of</v>

1126
00:48:58.831 --> 00:49:00.100
<v Speaker 4>fucking hail would come out.</v>

1127
00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:01.540
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but look at now.</v>

1128
00:49:01.541 --> 00:49:05.500
<v Speaker 4>Now I went to the shore 80 times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>80 fucking thousands of times and went</v>

1129
00:49:05.501 --> 00:49:08.560
<v Speaker 4>to that Jersey shore asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think that it would dissipate.</v>

1130
00:49:08.561 --> 00:49:10.690
<v Speaker 4>Like the way sandy came up and you know</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

1131
00:49:10.691 --> 00:49:11.740
<v Speaker 4>In three years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guess what?</v>

1132
00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:13.240
<v Speaker 4>There's going to be another one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jack.</v>

1133
00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:16.270
<v Speaker 4>You know those people we see every year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a tornado.</v>

1134
00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:18.730
<v Speaker 4>I ain't leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People make a thousand jokes about</v>

1135
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.330
<v Speaker 4>that's going to be South Jersey and</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking three years it'd be three.</v>

1136
00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:24.130
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be every seven or eight</v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

1137
00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:27.910
<v Speaker 4>Then it's going to go down and fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>every four years and then 50 years from</v>

1138
00:49:27.911 --> 00:49:31.090
<v Speaker 4>now it'll be every fucking it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know that just the way it is.</v>

1139
00:49:31.091 --> 00:49:33.610
<v Speaker 4>We evolved,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man though everything moves.</v>

1140
00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:36.520
<v Speaker 4>Don't they find those dinosaur bones and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Montana.</v>

1141
00:49:36.521 --> 00:49:39.460
<v Speaker 4>Then you write that and then they belong</v>
<v Speaker 4>to facial,</v>

1142
00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:41.140
<v Speaker 4>sea bass or whatever the fuck it was.</v>

1143
00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:42.770
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a Greg and western and see</v>

1144
00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:45.850
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They used to be a fucking interior</v>

1145
00:49:45.851 --> 00:49:47.830
<v Speaker 4>ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing that's always stuck me about</v>

1146
00:49:47.831 --> 00:49:51.340
<v Speaker 4>boulder was the devil's thumb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you're on baseline and you're</v>

1147
00:49:51.341 --> 00:49:54.790
<v Speaker 4>driving close to university in the South</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boulder and you look to your right and</v>

1148
00:49:54.791 --> 00:49:57.220
<v Speaker 4>there's a thing that pops out of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking mountain.</v>

1149
00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:58.400
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1150
00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:59.670
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just this figure.</v>

1151
00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:00.910
<v Speaker 4>I had to look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boulder,</v>

1152
00:50:00.911 --> 00:50:03.520
<v Speaker 4>Colorado at Devil's thumb and it pops</v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

1153
00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:06.220
<v Speaker 4>It makes you fucking think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes you fun.</v>

1154
00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:07.510
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the weirdest thing.</v>

1155
00:50:07.511 --> 00:50:10.350
<v Speaker 4>I hiked up there one time was my dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1156
00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:11.260
<v Speaker 4>Hercule.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1157
00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:14.350
<v Speaker 4>Hercules went up there and was missing</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a night and I went up there and</v>

1158
00:50:14.351 --> 00:50:17.170
<v Speaker 4>fucking tried to look them down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They got snakes up there,</v>

1159
00:50:17.171 --> 00:50:19.840
<v Speaker 4>the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it makes you think,</v>

1160
00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:22.630
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck was here 3 million years</v>
<v Speaker 4>ago,</v>

1161
00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:23.770
<v Speaker 4>not me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I don't know.</v>

1162
00:50:23.771 --> 00:50:26.700
<v Speaker 4>I don't have to be answered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did y'all look at the devil stump?</v>

1163
00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Come on.</v>

1164
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:28.611
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm bald.</v>

1165
00:50:28.611 --> 00:50:30.890
<v Speaker 1>Right damn baseline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you drive and look at that fucking</v>

1166
00:50:30.891 --> 00:50:33.380
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a beautiful thing.</v>

1167
00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:36.620
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear about the kid in Minnesota</v>
<v Speaker 1>that got bitten by a wolf?</v>

1168
00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:39.530
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wolf fit him in his fucking head while</v>

1169
00:50:39.531 --> 00:50:42.800
<v Speaker 1>he's sleeping and wouldn't let cow wolf</v>
<v Speaker 1>was trying to eat him.</v>

1170
00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:48.370
<v Speaker 1>He was sleeping outside the tent and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you don't know why it was other</v>

1171
00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:50.420
<v Speaker 1>people in the tent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the whole story was,</v>

1172
00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:54.080
<v Speaker 1>but the wolf clamp to hold of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking head and wouldn't let go.</v>

1173
00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:56.240
<v Speaker 1>He imagine what a terrifying feeling it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

1174
00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:59.630
<v Speaker 1>When a wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 75 pound wolf has clamped a hold of</v>

1175
00:50:59.631 --> 00:51:02.150
<v Speaker 1>your head while you're sleeping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is the,</v>

1176
00:51:02.151 --> 00:51:04.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first known attack,</v>

1177
00:51:04.830 --> 00:51:06.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that state's history that they have</v>

1178
00:51:06.621 --> 00:51:07.720
<v Speaker 1>like documented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

1179
00:51:07.721 --> 00:51:09.620
<v Speaker 1>fuck is sharks biting people more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

1180
00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:10.700
<v Speaker 1>We fucking today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1181
00:51:10.701 --> 00:51:14.600
<v Speaker 1>I was in Hawaii and they bit too fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>people while I was there.</v>

1182
00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:16.130
<v Speaker 1>One of them died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's serious.</v>

1183
00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get one kid got bit and his leg,</v>

1184
00:51:18.771 --> 00:51:21.920
<v Speaker 1>he was surfing and he got bit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>another woman got her arm bit off and</v>

1185
00:51:21.921 --> 00:51:25.550
<v Speaker 1>she died and kid live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The boy lived because his friends,</v>

1186
00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:27.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tied his leg off of the tourniquet and</v>

1187
00:51:27.921 --> 00:51:29.150
<v Speaker 1>brought him into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1188
00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:31.220
<v Speaker 1>into the hospital like really quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1189
00:51:31.221 --> 00:51:32.220
<v Speaker 1>they used a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1190
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:34.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a leash.</v>

1191
00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:37.100
<v Speaker 1>I think I got like a lease for a Surf</v>
<v Speaker 1>Board and they,</v>

1192
00:51:37.101 --> 00:51:38.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tied off his leg and tourniquet and</v>

1193
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:40.490
<v Speaker 1>pulled him out of the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they saw him,</v>

1194
00:51:40.491 --> 00:51:43.610
<v Speaker 1>they saw him get attacked by the shark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit them in the leg.</v>

1195
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.760
<v Speaker 1>It's tiger sharks apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're trying to figure out now</v>

1196
00:51:46.761 --> 00:51:50.060
<v Speaker 1>like the people in Hawaii are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to do some studies now,</v>

1197
00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:52.820
<v Speaker 1>they to try to figure out why these</v>
<v Speaker 1>tiger sharks being more aggressive.</v>

1198
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:54.050
<v Speaker 1>But there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1199
00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:58.670
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be a lot of issues with</v>
<v Speaker 1>wildlife in the ocean as well because</v>

1200
00:51:58.671 --> 00:52:01.640
<v Speaker 1>these predators don't have as much to</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat because we've fished so much.</v>

1201
00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:06.020
<v Speaker 1>We take so much tuna and so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>different fish that they survive off of.</v>

1202
00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:08.540
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine that a lot of fish are</v>

1203
00:52:08.541 --> 00:52:12.050
<v Speaker 1>going to be in real trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the fish that also rely on the fish</v>

1204
00:52:12.051 --> 00:52:14.900
<v Speaker 1>that we eat because we fucking kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything man.</v>

1205
00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:18.290
<v Speaker 1>And all the fish has that fucking shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>in it right now from Tokyo.</v>

1206
00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:20.090
<v Speaker 1>I've been seeing all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1207
00:52:20.091 --> 00:52:23.120
<v Speaker 1>there's a 3% increase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they said in the amount of</v>

1208
00:52:23.121 --> 00:52:24.740
<v Speaker 1>radiation that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1209
00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:26.750
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've found in fish,</v>

1210
00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:30.080
<v Speaker 1>which is not not worrisome as far as</v>
<v Speaker 1>like health.</v>

1211
00:52:30.081 --> 00:52:31.610
<v Speaker 1>Apparently you can get away with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>

1212
00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:33.220
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1213
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:35.060
<v Speaker 1>the worry is that this could get worse.</v>

1214
00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:36.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that radiation chart where it</v>

1215
00:52:36.951 --> 00:52:39.950
<v Speaker 1>just shows like in like 15 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all pretty much fucked.</v>

1216
00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:41.790
<v Speaker 1>Fuck is Shiva is fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1217
00:52:41.810 --> 00:52:43.580
<v Speaker 1>That's a scary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scary situation.</v>

1218
00:52:43.610 --> 00:52:44.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1219
00:52:44.531 --> 00:52:46.970
<v Speaker 1>it's a much more scary than it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1220
00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:48.200
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

1221
00:52:48.201 --> 00:52:52.760
<v Speaker 1>Did you see when Miley Cyrus did on TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she stuck her tongue out and showed her.</v>

1222
00:52:52.761 --> 00:52:56.780
<v Speaker 1>But meanwhile there's a fucking hole in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth that's filled with radioactive</v>

1223
00:52:56.781 --> 00:52:58.970
<v Speaker 1>shit and it's leaking into the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1224
00:52:58.971 --> 00:53:00.530
<v Speaker 1>it's really scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

1225
00:53:00.531 --> 00:53:03.530
<v Speaker 1>they can't stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't contain it and they don't</v>

1226
00:53:03.531 --> 00:53:06.590
<v Speaker 1>know what the fuck to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And instead we're looking at Syria and</v>

1227
00:53:06.591 --> 00:53:08.900
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at all these other women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's threats.</v>

1228
00:53:08.901 --> 00:53:11.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe serious someplace we really do</v>

1229
00:53:11.241 --> 00:53:13.040
<v Speaker 1>need to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they are using chemical weapons</v>

1230
00:53:13.041 --> 00:53:17.990
<v Speaker 1>but for sure that shit is going down to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fukushima far fucking shore.</v>

1231
00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:23.200
<v Speaker 1>There's a real problem there and tepco</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't know what the fuck to do and no</v>

1232
00:53:23.241 --> 00:53:25.710
<v Speaker 1>one in the world has a solution for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't,</v>

1233
00:53:25.770 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't</v>

1234
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:29.580
<v Speaker 6>know what the hell they're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's just constantly leaking</v>

1235
00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:33.300
<v Speaker 6>radioactive waste and what are the</v>
<v Speaker 6>people in Tokyo,</v>

1236
00:53:33.301 --> 00:53:35.070
<v Speaker 6>what's that going to be like in a</v>
<v Speaker 6>decade?</v>

1237
00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:37.530
<v Speaker 6>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what it means it's right down the hill</v>

1238
00:53:37.531 --> 00:53:39.200
<v Speaker 6>from that fucking place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean what is,</v>

1239
00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:40.440
<v Speaker 6>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what is going to happen?</v>

1240
00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:43.450
<v Speaker 6>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>are they going to have any like non</v>

1241
00:53:43.451 --> 00:53:46.590
<v Speaker 6>radioactive fish and don't they rely on</v>
<v Speaker 6>fish?</v>

1242
00:53:46.591 --> 00:53:49.470
<v Speaker 6>Like there's a huge amount of their</v>
<v Speaker 6>income and their,</v>

1243
00:53:49.471 --> 00:53:54.150
<v Speaker 6>their diet that relies on fish.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's going to be a terrible place.</v>

1244
00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:58.770
<v Speaker 6>It can be a real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know they're finding radioactive</v>

1245
00:53:58.771 --> 00:54:01.710
<v Speaker 6>bunny's like bunnies that have</v>
<v Speaker 6>deformities and shit that live there.</v>

1246
00:54:01.711 --> 00:54:04.800
<v Speaker 6>They're born with no ears.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like all sorts of weird shit going</v>

1247
00:54:04.801 --> 00:54:04.870
<v Speaker 6>on</v>

1248
00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:05.760
<v Speaker 3>down near there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1249
00:54:05.770 --> 00:54:07.510
<v Speaker 3>What if the fish start turning into</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1250
00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:09.670
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like these tiger sharks are eating these</v>

1251
00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:10.650
<v Speaker 3>radiate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1252
00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:13.450
<v Speaker 3>these fish and stuff and it's in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>water and it starts becoming what?</v>

1253
00:54:13.451 --> 00:54:16.180
<v Speaker 3>Like a Zombie sharp NATO.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like,</v>

1254
00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:17.500
<v Speaker 3>that's like real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1255
00:54:17.501 --> 00:54:18.334
<v Speaker 3>like</v>

1256
00:54:18.590 --> 00:54:21.030
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking and imagine that used in court</v>

1257
00:54:21.031 --> 00:54:22.920
<v Speaker 1>against you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like these bits are going to</v>

1258
00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:26.220
<v Speaker 1>these physical imagine like you trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to argue that you're smart and then</v>

1259
00:54:26.221 --> 00:54:26.821
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1260
00:54:26.821 --> 00:54:28.230
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's real.</v>

1261
00:54:28.231 --> 00:54:31.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like fish shark Nedo Zombie fish</v>
<v Speaker 1>shark nail.</v>

1262
00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:35.130
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the fish become like some Newton kind</v>

1263
00:54:35.131 --> 00:54:37.520
<v Speaker 1>of animals that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1264
00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:38.400
<v Speaker 1>Well the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1265
00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:40.770
<v Speaker 1>that could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mean I don't think that's really how</v>

1266
00:54:40.771 --> 00:54:43.410
<v Speaker 1>things me tell you the life isn't a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking comic books on,</v>

1267
00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:46.680
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a comic book that would become</v>

1268
00:54:46.681 --> 00:54:48.120
<v Speaker 1>Godzilla.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and that was though,</v>

1290
00:55:45.391 --> 00:55:48.750

<v Speaker 8>What people don't understand</v>

1315
00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:58.880
<v Speaker 1>when you were a kid or when I was a kid</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather,</v>

1316
00:56:58.881 --> 00:57:02.780
<v Speaker 1>and we would watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would have to be wooed at you.</v>

1317
00:57:02.781 --> 00:57:04.760
<v Speaker 1>You were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to suspend disbelief.</v>

1318
00:57:05.690 --> 00:57:09.800
<v Speaker 1>You were just amazed that they could</v>
<v Speaker 1>show you any visual representation of a</v>

1319
00:57:09.801 --> 00:57:13.370
<v Speaker 1>gigantic lizard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like anything that remotely looked like</v>

1320
00:57:13.371 --> 00:57:14.930
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were willing to accept,</v>

1321
00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:15.501
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>

1322
00:57:15.501 --> 00:57:18.620
<v Speaker 1>Look how bad that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we were willing to accept it because</v>

1323
00:57:18.621 --> 00:57:22.680
<v Speaker 1>we knew that up until then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there was stress that was the best</v>

1324
00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:23.780
<v Speaker 1>was the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>

1325
00:57:24.170 --> 00:57:27.620
<v Speaker 1>If you go to the original King Kong and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the original King Kong,</v>

1326
00:57:27.650 --> 00:57:30.920
<v Speaker 1>the differences in the way the Japanese</v>
<v Speaker 1>did it in the way of Ray Harryhausen did</v>

1327
00:57:30.921 --> 00:57:31.701
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1328
00:57:31.701 --> 00:57:33.740
<v Speaker 1>I think it was ray Harryhausen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might've made that up,</v>

1329
00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:35.630
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the animator,</v>

1330
00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:38.030
<v Speaker 1>they used to do it frame by frame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would,</v>

1331
00:57:38.031 --> 00:57:40.010
<v Speaker 1>they would just move the clay a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took a picture,</v>

1332
00:57:40.011 --> 00:57:40.791
<v Speaker 1>move the clay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little,</v>

1333
00:57:40.791 --> 00:57:41.780
<v Speaker 1>take a picture of moving to clay.</v>

1334
00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:42.613
<v Speaker 1>A little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took a picture.</v>

1335
00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:45.920
<v Speaker 1>It took fucking forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they would have these elaborate</v>

1336
00:57:45.921 --> 00:57:49.220
<v Speaker 1>fight scenes with these clay animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they created.</v>

1337
00:57:49.460 --> 00:57:54.080
<v Speaker 1>So He'd like King Kong fighting against</v>
<v Speaker 1>dinosaurs.</v>

1338
00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:56.840
<v Speaker 1>That shit took forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And look what it looked like.</v>

1339
00:57:57.410 --> 00:57:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look how fucking fake it looks.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1341
00:58:01.970 --> 00:58:04.110

<v Speaker 1>Really done.</v>

1343

<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

1349
00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:19.170

1356
00:58:40.790 --> 00:58:41.240
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

1357

<v Speaker 1>like show King Kong itself,</v>

1358
00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:51.440

<v Speaker 1>Cool guys getting up there trying to</v>

1359
00:58:51.441 --> 00:58:56.040
<v Speaker 1>figure out what happened.</v>

1361
00:59:01.450 --> 00:59:03.100
<v Speaker 1>I think they just stuck a real lizard in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1362
00:59:03.101 --> 00:59:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

1364
00:59:05.290 --> 00:59:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they would do that though.</v>

1365
00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:11.470
<v Speaker 1>They would have a movie and they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>have like a real lizard and you could</v>

1366
00:59:11.471 --> 00:59:13.900
<v Speaker 1>tell the lizard was nowhere near them in</v>
<v Speaker 1>real life.</v>

1367
00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:15.490
<v Speaker 1>But they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh look.</v>

1368
00:59:15.790 --> 00:59:19.030
<v Speaker 1>And they would just insert this giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking lizard in the back.</v>

1369
00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:22.190
<v Speaker 1>How weird was it had been to act in</v>
<v Speaker 1>these movies?</v>

<v Speaker 6>to add in this killer spider.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is nuts.</v>

1374
00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:40.250
<v Speaker 6>Look how bad it looks when they pick up</v>
<v Speaker 6>someone and they're getting bit</v>

1375
00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:48.880

1384
01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:15.660
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>TV would probably came a long time.</v>

1385
01:00:15.661 --> 01:00:18.840
<v Speaker 6>I was fucking radio like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought the Green Hornet was a radio</v>

1386
01:00:18.841 --> 01:00:20.970
<v Speaker 6>show and all that Shit TV.</v>

1387

<v Speaker 6>I didn't find anything for WIC,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which</v>

1388
01:00:28.990 --> 01:00:33.990
<v Speaker 6>the invention of the TV.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1389
01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:37.790
<v Speaker 6>So apparently there's not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not a single thing,</v>

1390
01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:43.270
<v Speaker 6>not single thing that you can point to</v>
<v Speaker 6>because there was a lot of shit that got</v>

1391
01:00:43.881 --> 01:00:48.881
<v Speaker 6>invented that related to the investment</v>
<v Speaker 6>around with a bunch of people and your</v>

1392
01:00:48.921 --> 01:00:52.070
<v Speaker 6>family and listen for the Green Hornet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That'd be amazing.</v>

1393
01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:55.640
<v Speaker 6>Eight to nine every Friday night.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then Wednesday was something else</v>

1394
01:00:55.641 --> 01:01:00.080
<v Speaker 6>and Thursday was comedy night.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like they'd have like a lot Jackie</v>

1395

1396
01:01:02.811 --> 01:01:07.460
<v Speaker 6>Annie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it happened in 1862 was the first still</v>

1397
01:01:07.461 --> 01:01:12.461
<v Speaker 6>image that was transferred and this guy</v>
<v Speaker 6>had something called the Pan Telegraph.</v>

1398
01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:18.130
<v Speaker 6>So he transferred picture by telegraph</v>
<v Speaker 6>this thing or this electronic thing,</v>

1399
01:01:19.971 --> 01:01:23.360
<v Speaker 6>transfer it and they became the first</v>
<v Speaker 6>person to transmit a still image over</v>

1400
01:01:23.361 --> 01:01:25.580
<v Speaker 6>wires.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck man.</v>

1401
01:01:25.581 --> 01:01:30.140
<v Speaker 6>They figured that out in 1862 you know</v>
<v Speaker 6>craze that is slavery became illegal in</v>

1402
01:01:30.141 --> 01:01:35.141
<v Speaker 6>1965 so while they were still slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 6>someone had figured out how to send a</v>

1403
01:01:36.021 --> 01:01:39.050
<v Speaker 6>photo over wire.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck,</v>

1404
01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:41.270
<v Speaker 6>I've been wanting to,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Western union was huge.</v>

1407
01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:52.180
<v Speaker 6>You got to go to western and then paid</v>

1412
01:02:01.361 --> 01:02:05.740
<v Speaker 6>with selenium and light and this reveals</v>
<v Speaker 6>the possibility for inventors to</v>

1413
01:02:05.741 --> 01:02:09.160
<v Speaker 6>transform images into electronic</v>
<v Speaker 6>signals.</v>

1414
01:02:10.270 --> 01:02:11.830
<v Speaker 6>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did they figure that out?</v>

<v Speaker 6>images</v>

1418
01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:23.510
<v Speaker 1>into electronic signals so that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could send her them sent,</v>

1432
01:02:59.851 --> 01:03:04.851
<v Speaker 1>electricity was held and that is where</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian Konstantin pers ski.</v>

1434
01:03:09.691 --> 01:03:13.710
<v Speaker 1>known use of the word television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was invented by a Russian</v>

1435
01:03:13.711 --> 01:03:16.890
<v Speaker 1>gentleman or the word was at least</v>

01:03:17.950 --> 01:03:21.000
<v Speaker 1>You know when you go back and think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about dudes that were inventing like</v>

1437
01:03:21.001 --> 01:03:25.270
<v Speaker 1>really mind blowing shit like back in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 18 hundreds or the fifth you know,</v>

1438
01:03:25.410 --> 01:03:28.080
<v Speaker 1>even earlier than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the dude who figured out the</v>

1439
01:03:28.081 --> 01:03:29.820
<v Speaker 1>printing press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1440
01:03:29.821 --> 01:03:32.730
<v Speaker 1>but you know how much shit you didn't</v>

1444
01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:41.610
<v Speaker 1>The guy who invented math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bought that.</v>

1445
01:03:41.770 --> 01:03:44.920
<v Speaker 1>I give him credit every day.</v>

1447
01:03:47.671 --> 01:03:51.000
<v Speaker 1>putting shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I saw that on discovery,</v>

1448
01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:54.730
<v Speaker 1>I was blown the fuck away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who wasn't an invented math</v>

1449
01:03:54.731 --> 01:03:55.470
<v Speaker 1>methods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her one dude,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Was that numb?</v>

1456
01:04:08.310 --> 01:04:13.110
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't math used in World War II?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the story was that they used the</v>

1457
01:04:13.111 --> 01:04:16.890
<v Speaker 1>Hitler troops used it and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used it on the Japanese kamikaze</v>

1458
01:04:16.891 --> 01:04:19.410
<v Speaker 1>pilots to get them to be willing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>speed.</v>

1459
01:04:19.470 --> 01:04:23.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's the shit that they</v>

1464
01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:35.090
<v Speaker 1>And it was first made in 1887 again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 1887 yeah.</v>

1465
01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Uh hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm Germany of the picture of his</v>

1466
01:04:40.951 --> 01:04:43.890
<v Speaker 1>Dick to some chick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So before he could invent the camera and</v>

1467
01:04:43.891 --> 01:04:46.550
<v Speaker 1>the gifted electronic wave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta stay up for a week to fucking</v>

1468
01:04:46.551 --> 01:04:48.270
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry that that was just</v>

1469
01:04:48.271 --> 01:04:50.960
<v Speaker 1>amphetamines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in Fatto means for 1887</v>

1470
01:04:51.250 --> 01:04:54.600
<v Speaker 1>methamphetamine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was more potent and easy to make,</v>

1471
01:04:54.601 --> 01:04:59.601
<v Speaker 1>was developed in Japan in 1919,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crystalline powder was soluble in</v>

1472
01:05:00.151 --> 01:05:01.500
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making it for,</v>

1473
01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:03.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making it a perfect candidate for</v>

1474
01:05:03.481 --> 01:05:07.650
<v Speaker 1>injection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Methamphetamine went into wide use</v>

1475
01:05:07.651 --> 01:05:12.480
<v Speaker 1>during World War Two when both sides</v>
<v Speaker 1>used it to keep troops awake,</v>

1476
01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:16.410
<v Speaker 1>holy fucking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>High doses were given a Japanese</v>

1477
01:05:16.411 --> 01:05:18.460
<v Speaker 1>kamikaze pilots before their suicide</v>

1478
01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:23.110
<v Speaker 6>missions and after the war mess and</v>
<v Speaker 6>methamphetamine abuse by injection</v>

1479
01:05:23.111 --> 01:05:28.111
<v Speaker 6>reached epidemic proportions when</v>
<v Speaker 6>supplies stored for military use became</v>

1480
01:05:28.270 --> 01:05:33.190
<v Speaker 6>available to the Japanese public man in</v>
<v Speaker 6>1950s,</v>

1481
01:05:33.191 --> 01:05:38.191
<v Speaker 6>methamphetamine was prescribed as a diet</v>
<v Speaker 6>aid and to fight depression easily</v>

1482
01:05:38.891 --> 01:05:42.220
<v Speaker 6>available.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was used as a nonmedical stimulant by</v>

1483
01:05:42.221 --> 01:05:45.010
<v Speaker 6>college students,</v>
<v Speaker 6>truck drivers and athletes,</v>

1484
01:05:45.370 --> 01:05:48.070
<v Speaker 6>and the abuse of the drug spread.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit.</v>

1485
01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:52.720
<v Speaker 6>Did you know that these to prescribe</v>
<v Speaker 6>methamphetamines for depression,</v>

1486
01:05:53.830 --> 01:05:56.930
<v Speaker 6>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>at least in the probably worked the back</v>

1489
01:06:00.721 --> 01:06:04.120
<v Speaker 6>the California Diet?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He gave us a photo of them amphetamines.</v>

1490
01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:06.550
<v Speaker 6>You know what's crazy that I'm,</v>

<v Speaker 6>It,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this was way before.</v>

1500
01:06:24.371 --> 01:06:28.090
<v Speaker 6>Really it was his sister used to sell</v>
<v Speaker 6>him as black beauties.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Shit.</v>

1503
01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:35.410
<v Speaker 6>I used to go to East Stroudsburg,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Pennsylvania and buy a thousand black</v>

1504
01:06:35.411 --> 01:06:39.700
<v Speaker 6>beauties with 35 bucks and I would,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so what is exactly a black beauty?</v>

1505
01:06:39.701 --> 01:06:42.020
<v Speaker 6>It was just a little fucking black</v>
<v Speaker 6>things they made.</v>

1506
01:06:42.021 --> 01:06:45.700
<v Speaker 6>Then the 70s and they were the original</v>
<v Speaker 6>diet pill and it was an amphetamine and</v>

1507
01:06:45.701 --> 01:06:46.450
<v Speaker 6>then fed phenome.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Me.</v>

1508
01:06:46.450 --> 01:06:48.230
<v Speaker 6>What do you know what kind of was?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1509
01:06:48.310 --> 01:06:50.260
<v Speaker 6>who gives a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 6>There were $35 for it.</v>

1510
01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:55.840
<v Speaker 6>I sold him $400,035 for it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I will sell them for 35 to 102 the</v>

1511
01:06:55.841 --> 01:06:58.150
<v Speaker 6>wrestlers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a dollar a piece.</v>

1512
01:06:58.270 --> 01:07:00.120
<v Speaker 6>You have no idea what a cash cow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that thing.</v>

1513
01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:02.650
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I remember like one night I went out</v>

1514
01:07:02.651 --> 01:07:03.580
<v Speaker 6>and I had no blown.</v>

1515
01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:05.530
<v Speaker 6>I ate like three of them drank and is</v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

1516
01:07:06.570 --> 01:07:09.880
<v Speaker 6>and I was sick for a fucking week.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I never rate those pills,</v>

1517
01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:13.300
<v Speaker 6>but I remember people cracking them open</v>
<v Speaker 6>and snorting those motherfuckers.</v>

1518
01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:16.300
<v Speaker 6>You know what's really interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you talking about that and you're</v>

1519
01:07:16.301 --> 01:07:19.990
<v Speaker 6>talking about selling bootlegging these</v>
<v Speaker 6>illegal drugs.</v>

1520
01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:23.410
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it depends on how much money you make</v>

1521
01:07:23.470 --> 01:07:26.170
<v Speaker 6>and what you do with that money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whether or not you become legitimate.</v>

1522
01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:28.780
<v Speaker 6>I was a junior in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but what I'm saying is like,</v>

1523
01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:30.340
<v Speaker 6>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but look at the Kennedy's.</v>

1524
01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:32.530
<v Speaker 6>The Kennedy's did the exact same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the same thing.</v>

1525
01:07:32.531 --> 01:07:35.770
<v Speaker 6>Kennedy's became legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It became a very wealthy and established</v>

1526
01:07:35.771 --> 01:07:38.800
<v Speaker 6>family for moonshine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They were selling drugs.</v>

1527
01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:41.020
<v Speaker 6>They're selling liquid drugs that were</v>
<v Speaker 6>illegal,</v>

1528
01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:43.720
<v Speaker 6>but they did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They did the right thing with all the</v>

1529
01:07:43.721 --> 01:07:45.490
<v Speaker 6>money they got out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>got ahold of it,</v>

1530
01:07:45.491 --> 01:07:47.350
<v Speaker 6>invested it in politics,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sending,</v>

1531
01:07:47.351 --> 01:07:48.200
<v Speaker 6>getting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean they,</v>

1532
01:07:48.210 --> 01:07:50.890
<v Speaker 6>they did,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they had a lot of fucking money and then</v>

1533
01:07:50.891 --> 01:07:52.780
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they got out of it and once it became</v>

1534
01:07:52.781 --> 01:07:54.880
<v Speaker 6>legal or something,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean I know how the fuck they</v>

1535
01:07:54.881 --> 01:07:59.881
<v Speaker 6>transitioned at a bootleg yet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that's like the known history of Joe</v>

1536
01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:00.790
<v Speaker 6>Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1537
01:08:00.790 --> 01:08:03.220
<v Speaker 6>The the father,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the father was like a,</v>

1538
01:08:03.221 --> 01:08:05.710
<v Speaker 6>he was a moonshine runner,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is kind of crazy.</v>

1539
01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:08.560
<v Speaker 6>I mean how much different is that</v>
<v Speaker 6>really?</v>

1540
01:08:08.590 --> 01:08:11.320
<v Speaker 6>Then you sell on these black beauties.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's really no different.</v>

1541
01:08:11.550 --> 01:08:14.050
<v Speaker 6>It's like morally or ethically it's the</v>
<v Speaker 6>same thing.</v>

1542
01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:16.130
<v Speaker 6>So like if you had stuck</v>

1543
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:20.060
<v Speaker 4>with the black beauty business and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>got into politics later,</v>

1544
01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:23.600
<v Speaker 4>I mean that would have been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that'd been acceptable.</v>

1545
01:08:23.690 --> 01:08:27.860
<v Speaker 4>I would say some of those were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was right after my mom died and I</v>

1546
01:08:27.861 --> 01:08:30.320
<v Speaker 4>was like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I would go on Saturdays,</v>

1547
01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:33.400
<v Speaker 4>this kid nick be a Monte,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a football play up.</v>

1548
01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:36.500
<v Speaker 4>Then he would pick me up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We drive like an hour and a half and</v>

1549
01:08:36.501 --> 01:08:39.800
<v Speaker 4>we'd go into this room and these college</v>
<v Speaker 4>kids that look like they were 40,</v>

1550
01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:42.860
<v Speaker 4>and that's all they did all week was</v>
<v Speaker 4>make different</v>

1551
01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:47.630
<v Speaker 4>things and they would make acid blotter</v>
<v Speaker 4>acid paper.</v>

1552
01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:51.650
<v Speaker 4>They would make four way acid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would make little Mescalin and</v>

1553
01:08:51.651 --> 01:08:55.490
<v Speaker 4>he'll make black beauties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what they did all weekend.</v>

1554
01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:57.230
<v Speaker 4>Their parents thought they were going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>school.</v>

1555
01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:58.580
<v Speaker 4>These are these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1556
01:08:58.581 --> 01:09:01.160

<v Speaker 4>This is what nerds did.</v>

1557
01:09:01.790 --> 01:09:02.510

<v Speaker 4>this was,</v>

1558
01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:03.770

01:16:37.471 --> 01:16:39.360
<v Speaker 6>the back seat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You'd stuffed him in the front seat all</v>

1725
01:16:39.361 --> 01:16:41.800
<v Speaker 6>the way up to the ceiling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you were driving around like almost</v>

1726
01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:44.970
<v Speaker 6>completely blind at the right hand side.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like it was very tricky like looking</v>

1727
01:16:44.971 --> 01:16:48.120
<v Speaker 6>around at where you were gone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so after a while I made it a little</v>

1728
01:16:48.121 --> 01:16:51.210
<v Speaker 6>bit of cash with this fucking venture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And like me,</v>

1729
01:16:51.211 --> 01:16:53.670
<v Speaker 6>I'm always thinking of expanding.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I uh,</v>

1730
01:16:53.820 --> 01:16:56.490
<v Speaker 6>I got a van,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I bought this big ass cargo van with no</v>

1731
01:16:56.491 --> 01:17:00.810
<v Speaker 6>windows and then I expanded my route.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was using him right wagons.</v>

1732
01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:03.180
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had to figure out a way to make enough</v>

1733
01:17:03.181 --> 01:17:05.910
<v Speaker 6>money that I didn't have to do anything</v>
<v Speaker 6>else while I was competing.</v>

1734
01:17:06.270 --> 01:17:10.460
<v Speaker 6>And so the only way I could really think</v>
<v Speaker 6>of it before I made money teaching was</v>

1735
01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:12.830
<v Speaker 4>delivering newspapers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was the only thing that made sense</v>

1736
01:17:12.831 --> 01:17:15.110
<v Speaker 4>to me because it was several hours a</v>
<v Speaker 4>day,</v>

1737
01:17:15.111 --> 01:17:17.000
<v Speaker 4>like three or four hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when it was done,</v>

1738
01:17:17.001 --> 01:17:20.270
<v Speaker 4>it was done and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was no boss to answer to as long</v>

1739
01:17:20.271 --> 01:17:22.100
<v Speaker 4>as I delivered the papers to where they</v>
<v Speaker 4>were supposed to go.</v>

1740
01:17:22.101 --> 01:17:23.540
<v Speaker 4>There was no problems and I was good at</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1741
01:17:23.541 --> 01:17:25.550
<v Speaker 4>I did it every day and it taught me</v>
<v Speaker 4>discipline,</v>

1742
01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:30.320
<v Speaker 4>like having something that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do 365 days a year makes you fucking do</v>

1743
01:17:30.321 --> 01:17:31.190
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just do it,</v>

1744
01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:33.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we didn't even think of by step.</v>

1745
01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:35.330
<v Speaker 4>You just fucking do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's part of your life.</v>

1746
01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:38.220
<v Speaker 4>You just get up and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I applied for a paper route one time,</v>

1747
01:17:38.221 --> 01:17:40.280
<v Speaker 4>like going into the eighth grade,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to be a goody,</v>

1748
01:17:40.281 --> 01:17:41.960
<v Speaker 4>goody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>goody good.</v>

<v Speaker 4>July.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Thanksgiving week and I don't even think</v>

1751

<v Speaker 4>about it like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

<v Speaker 4>This is a hill and a half.</v>

1754
01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:55.870

<v Speaker 4>hometown.</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's what I learned.</v>

<v Speaker 4>cause I drove every day.</v>

<v Speaker 4>it was like really hard for me to get</v>

1784
01:19:17.121 --> 01:19:19.400
<v Speaker 4>insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a gang accidents.</v>

1785
01:19:19.550 --> 01:19:23.270
<v Speaker 4>I was a horrible driver.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then I made the mistake.</v>

1786

<v Speaker 4>I'm moving to Aspen and you think,</v>

1815
01:20:40.981 --> 01:20:41.910

<v Speaker 6>I grew up in Ohio,</v>

1816
01:20:41.911 --> 01:20:45.900
<v Speaker 6>so I had to deal with this all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but look at this like you spun out.</v>

1818
01:20:47.701 --> 01:20:49.680
<v Speaker 6>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The only good part is when you got in an</v>

1819
01:20:49.681 --> 01:20:51.720
<v Speaker 6>accident,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't as bad because you were</v>

1820
01:20:51.721 --> 01:20:53.400
<v Speaker 6>sliding when you hit that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's true.</v>

1821
01:20:53.401 --> 01:20:55.380
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a big deal.</v>

1822
01:20:55.890 --> 01:20:58.770
<v Speaker 6>That's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you got in an accident in the snow,</v>

1823
01:20:58.771 --> 01:21:00.780
<v Speaker 6>it's like bumper cars kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1824
01:21:00.810 --> 01:21:02.010
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People who don't know,</v>

1825
01:21:02.011 --> 01:21:03.630
<v Speaker 6>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they've never experienced that before.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like that in,</v>

1827
01:21:05.690 --> 01:21:09.210
<v Speaker 6>in any other situation would be a</v>
<v Speaker 6>devastating impact.</v>

1828
01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:11.610
<v Speaker 6>It still can be pretty shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is bad because this is like,</v>

1829
01:21:11.630 --> 01:21:12.510
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is horrible.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I'm watching this.</v>

1833
01:21:19.961 --> 01:21:22.960
<v Speaker 6>I'm getting anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I really honestly think that people who</v>

1834
01:21:22.961 --> 01:21:24.880
<v Speaker 6>don't grow up driving in this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shit,</v>

<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

1836
01:21:25.540 --> 01:21:28.120
<v Speaker 6>you miss out on a certain amount of</v>

<v Speaker 6>it's fucking trippy shit.</v>

1976
01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:14.900
<v Speaker 6>Really Weird Shit because these really</v>
<v Speaker 6>were the rock house and they,</v>

1977
01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:18.370
<v Speaker 6>this is really how they were rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They really did have parties where women</v>

1978
01:28:18.371 --> 01:28:22.090
<v Speaker 6>would wear antlers on their heads where</v>
<v Speaker 6>they would have naked women,</v>

1979
01:28:22.150 --> 01:28:24.560
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pushed around on like a,</v>

1980
01:28:24.730 --> 01:28:27.130
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it looks like a casket covered in roses.</v>

1981
01:28:27.580 --> 01:28:29.620
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's really strange or at least an</v>

1982
01:28:29.621 --> 01:28:31.390
<v Speaker 6>effigy of a naked woman actually.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It looks like,</v>

1983
01:28:31.570 --> 01:28:32.470
<v Speaker 6>I can't tell if that's a real,</v>

1984
01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:35.220
<v Speaker 4>they kill a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They kill a bitch to they would kill a</v>

1985
01:28:35.221 --> 01:28:37.710
<v Speaker 4>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like just like a hipster party.</v>

1986
01:28:37.740 --> 01:28:40.140
<v Speaker 4>Well it's a bit of a party for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Crazy People</v>

1987
01:28:40.710 --> 01:28:41.670
<v Speaker 6>party for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the,</v>

1988
01:28:41.671 --> 01:28:46.020
<v Speaker 6>I think the idea like some freaky shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you want to follow the conspiracy</v>

1989
01:28:46.021 --> 01:28:48.810
<v Speaker 6>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the idea is that these type of people,</v>

1990
01:28:49.230 --> 01:28:52.920
<v Speaker 6>these elite societies that what they</v>
<v Speaker 6>would do is they would have these</v>

1991
01:28:52.921 --> 01:28:55.350
<v Speaker 6>rituals and they would do something</v>
<v Speaker 6>really fucked up.</v>

1992
01:28:55.351 --> 01:28:58.110
<v Speaker 6>So no one could ever talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like they would kill somebody.</v>

1993
01:28:58.111 --> 01:29:01.490
<v Speaker 6>Like they'd take a prostitute and killer</v>
<v Speaker 6>in front of everybody and then barrier</v>

1994
01:29:01.491 --> 01:29:02.280
<v Speaker 6>or somewhere</v>

1995
01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:04.500
<v Speaker 1>and no one to talk about it cause they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were all implicated then.</v>

1996
01:29:04.501 --> 01:29:05.700
<v Speaker 1>So that's everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

1997
01:29:05.850 --> 01:29:08.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like your bond to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this cult that was the I,</v>

1998
01:29:08.460 --> 01:29:10.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>

1999
01:29:11.010 --> 01:29:15.480
<v Speaker 1>The woman's wearing a fucking staghead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a big deer mask.</v>

2000
01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:19.770
<v Speaker 1>How weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you have like billions of dollars,</v>

2001
01:29:20.070 --> 01:29:22.710
<v Speaker 1>it's 1976 and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

2002
01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:25.290
<v Speaker 1>You know there was no internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't get in trouble.</v>

2003
01:29:25.410 --> 01:29:27.780
<v Speaker 1>There's no anonymous is going to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>take down your website,</v>

2004
01:29:29.410 --> 01:29:34.410
<v Speaker 1>can do some crazy Rothschilds character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people back then,</v>

2005
01:29:37.230 --> 01:29:38.310
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

2006
01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:42.470
<v Speaker 4>to have so much money that you pay off</v>
<v Speaker 4>the attorney that night before the</v>

2007
01:29:42.471 --> 01:29:44.270
<v Speaker 4>party,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a liaison for the police</v>

2010
01:29:50.341 --> 01:29:52.160

<v Speaker 4>predictable.</v>

2049
01:31:16.910 --> 01:31:20.480
<v Speaker 4>Like it was not predictable at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was very dark and very realistic,</v>

2050
01:31:20.481 --> 01:31:22.730
<v Speaker 4>like very realistic and tuned in to</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2051
01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:25.610
<v Speaker 4>that era,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when he starts drinking and turns</v>

<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

2564
01:52:48.350 --> 01:52:51.050
<v Speaker 6>And one of the ways that I learned how</v>
<v Speaker 6>to do that bit right,</v>

2565
01:52:51.051 --> 01:52:51.800
<v Speaker 6>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2566
01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:55.340
<v Speaker 6>do it different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he kind of explained to me like what</v>

2567
01:52:55.341 --> 01:52:56.830
<v Speaker 6>was good about it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He,</v>

<v Speaker 6>he like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cause he's such a great actor.</v>

2569
01:52:59.240 --> 01:53:02.210
<v Speaker 6>Like even in good times,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like he's watched that show.</v>

2570
01:53:02.270 --> 01:53:03.380
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck yeah.</v>

2571
01:53:03.381 --> 01:53:06.430
<v Speaker 6>He says that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He got his foot chopped off.</v>

2572
01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:07.190
<v Speaker 6>Remember?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

2573
01:53:07.190 --> 01:53:08.360
<v Speaker 6>he was rude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He,</v>

2574
01:53:08.440 --> 01:53:11.960
<v Speaker 6>he was so good as an actor.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like even in like a sitcom.</v>

2575
01:53:11.961 --> 01:53:14.390
<v Speaker 6>It's like he had these powerful fucking</v>
<v Speaker 6>moments,</v>

2576
01:53:14.391 --> 01:53:16.460
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So when he told me,</v>

2577
01:53:16.461 --> 01:53:17.151
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 6>like yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's so we free up there when you're</v>

2579
01:53:19.641 --> 01:53:21.350

<v Speaker 6>about shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>

2581
01:53:22.521 --> 01:53:24.560
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you like thinking like that tiger.</v>

2582
01:53:24.770 --> 01:53:26.600
<v Speaker 6>And I realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's really the way to do it.</v>

2583
01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:28.910
<v Speaker 6>You've got to actually almost pretend</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're a tiger.</v>

2584
01:53:28.911 --> 01:53:32.240
<v Speaker 6>Like think like that thing thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's the way it works.</v>

2585
01:53:32.660 --> 01:53:35.870
<v Speaker 6>I kind of figured it out because of him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because of him talking to me about it.</v>

2586
01:53:35.900 --> 01:53:36.651
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

2587
01:53:36.651 --> 01:53:38.330
<v Speaker 6>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>

2588
01:53:38.660 --> 01:53:40.700
<v Speaker 6>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it made me so confident because he</v>

2589
01:53:40.701 --> 01:53:41.870
<v Speaker 6>built,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because he said that,</v>

2590
01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:43.131
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like Jesus,</v>

2591
01:53:43.131 --> 01:53:46.100

<v Speaker 6>It's like this is 100%.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Like that's the guy from roots.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the guy from good times.</v>

<v Speaker 4>in movies before.</v>

2813
02:03:15.260 --> 02:03:18.380
<v Speaker 4>Like as far as like karate scenes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seemed more brutal and more</v>

2814
02:03:18.381 --> 02:03:20.400
<v Speaker 4>realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never saw Steve was a guy moving to</v>

2815
02:03:20.420 --> 02:03:23.190
<v Speaker 4>black movie theater,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't that they go fight and</v>

2816
02:03:23.191 --> 02:03:24.260
<v Speaker 4>they cheer for white people.</v>

2817
02:03:25.130 --> 02:03:29.240
<v Speaker 4>Black people don't cheer for black</v>
<v Speaker 4>people or white people smacking the</v>

<v Speaker 4>street in Harlem.</v>

2820

<v Speaker 4>ever won till this day.</v>

<v Speaker 4>when he opens his eyes and the mud.</v>

2822
02:03:41.310 --> 02:03:43.130
<v Speaker 4>I remember that scene when he opens his</v>
<v Speaker 4>eyes.</v>

2823
02:03:43.180 --> 02:03:44.750
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

02:03:51.801 --> 02:03:54.470
<v Speaker 4>movie other than 78th street back in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>

2827
02:03:54.860 --> 02:03:57.720

<v Speaker 4>The window was in like right,</v>

2828
02:03:57.790 --> 02:04:00.470
<v Speaker 4>right about above the law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you got in and above the law in the</v>

2829
02:04:00.471 --> 02:04:02.540
<v Speaker 4>1980s and went to Harlem and watch</v>
<v Speaker 4>bubble,</v>

2830
02:04:02.550 --> 02:04:04.010

<v Speaker 4>I bet it would be one of the most</v>

2831
02:04:04.011 --> 02:04:06.470

<v Speaker 4>Philly and me and Tommy Jr and his girl.</v>

2833
02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:16.840
<v Speaker 4>We went to a a theater in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 4>filming and this was like a,</v>

2834
02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:21.020
<v Speaker 4>when the UFC had the fights in Philly</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we got there like a day early.</v>

2835
02:04:21.021 --> 02:04:23.450
<v Speaker 4>We played pool and we got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we got so high,</v>

2836
02:04:23.451 --> 02:04:26.900
<v Speaker 4>we were terrified of her own shadow and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then we went to this black neighborhood.</v>

2837
02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:29.990
<v Speaker 4>It was the only way place that they had</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we didn't even know.</v>

2838
02:04:29.991 --> 02:04:32.720
<v Speaker 4>We didn't know it was like an urban</v>
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood until we got there.</v>

2839
02:04:33.050 --> 02:04:34.280
<v Speaker 4>But once we were in the theater,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were like,</v>

2840
02:04:34.281 --> 02:04:35.600

<v Speaker 4>white people.</v>

2842
02:04:37.141 --> 02:04:39.450
<v Speaker 4>We found each other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we huddled together and then once the</v>

2843
02:04:39.451 --> 02:04:41.280
<v Speaker 4>movie theater,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when we got in there,</v>

2844

2852
02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:04.200

<v Speaker 4>and is not funny.</v>

2986
02:11:01.041 --> 02:11:04.010
<v Speaker 6>And then what happens if somehow in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>future,</v>

2987

<v Speaker 6>Anybody who's going to buy heroin</v>
<v Speaker 6>online,</v>

2992
02:11:17.570 --> 02:11:20.690

<v Speaker 6>If you got to hide your name,</v>

2993
02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:22.940
<v Speaker 6>it's going to be a comment or on</v>
<v Speaker 6>youtube,</v>

2994
02:11:22.970 --> 02:11:25.740
<v Speaker 6>you're not going to go on there as Joey</v>
<v Speaker 6>Diaz and say crazy shit about Taylor</v>

2995
02:11:25.741 --> 02:11:27.070

<v Speaker 6>if you have a match and you know,</v>

2997
02:11:30.531 --> 02:11:31.450
<v Speaker 6>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2998
02:11:31.730 --> 02:11:32.830
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think you,</v>

2999
02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:36.530
<v Speaker 6>you controlling your heroin use,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you could quick a fucking switch and 20</v>

3000
02:11:36.531 --> 02:11:38.930
<v Speaker 6>minutes later some guy delivers it to</v>

3003
02:11:42.770 --> 02:11:46.430
<v Speaker 6>It seems like once there's a desire for</v>
<v Speaker 6>something,</v>

3004
02:11:46.490 --> 02:11:50.240
<v Speaker 6>it's impossible to stop people from</v>
<v Speaker 6>figuring out a way to get it to people,</v>

3005
02:11:50.540 --> 02:11:55.430
<v Speaker 6>especially if it's illegal and it only</v>
<v Speaker 6>makes sense that they'd be using the</v>

3006
02:11:55.431 --> 02:11:56.390
<v Speaker 6>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 6>There's no way else.</v>

3009
02:12:00.740 --> 02:12:02.990
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's going to happen,</v>

3010
02:12:03.050 --> 02:12:03.531
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3011
02:12:03.531 --> 02:12:05.120
<v Speaker 6>it's not like anybody's going to hide</v>
<v Speaker 6>that shit.</v>

3012
02:12:05.660 --> 02:12:07.970
<v Speaker 6>Speak speaking to Haydn.</v>

3141
02:18:13.200 --> 02:18:16.890
<v Speaker 6>He did a video of him live from Bohemian</v>
<v Speaker 6>Grove is like Alex Jones is one of his</v>

3142
02:18:16.891 --> 02:18:18.630
<v Speaker 6>first videos.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They really do.</v>

3143
02:18:18.631 --> 02:18:21.300
<v Speaker 6>He's right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They really do have like a ritual that</v>

3144
02:18:21.301 --> 02:18:24.240
<v Speaker 6>they do there if you find it online,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I guarantee it's up there.</v>

3145
02:18:24.241 --> 02:18:26.320
<v Speaker 6>Alex Jones live and Bohemian Grove.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>

3146
02:18:26.360 --> 02:18:27.330

02:18:27.360 --> 02:18:31.860
<v Speaker 6>he goes there and these dudes there in</v>
<v Speaker 6>front of this gigantic stone owl and</v>

3148
02:18:31.861 --> 02:18:35.190
<v Speaker 6>they have the sticks and they say</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're going to burn the sticks like</v>

3149
02:18:35.191 --> 02:18:37.710
<v Speaker 6>it's an effigy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess the idea behind that is the</v>

3150
02:18:37.711 --> 02:18:40.680
<v Speaker 6>sticks are supposed to represent a</v>
<v Speaker 6>sacrifice and in the old days they</v>

3151
02:18:40.681 --> 02:18:42.750
<v Speaker 6>actually used to take a person and light</v>
<v Speaker 6>them on fire.</v>

3223
02:22:12.350 --> 02:22:15.530
<v Speaker 6>check this out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nixon said in his Watergate tapes,</v>

3224
02:22:15.830 --> 02:22:17.810
<v Speaker 6>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if I were to choose the speech that gave</v>

3225
02:22:17.811 --> 02:22:20.300
<v Speaker 6>me the most pleasure and satisfaction in</v>
<v Speaker 6>my political career,</v>

3226
02:22:20.301 --> 02:22:25.190
<v Speaker 6>it would be the leg speech chip.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Bohemian Grove in six 1967 is this</v>

3227
02:22:25.230 --> 02:22:26.280
<v Speaker 6>speech traditionally</v>

3228

<v Speaker 3>was off the record and receive no</v>
<v Speaker 3>publicity at the time.</v>

3229

3231
02:22:36.271 --> 02:22:39.330

<v Speaker 3>thing I've ever,</v>

3232
02:22:39.450 --> 02:22:44.450

<v Speaker 3>San Francisco.</v>

3236
02:22:50.300 --> 02:22:54.060
<v Speaker 6>Nixon said that</v>
<v Speaker 6>terrible human being.</v>

<v Speaker 6>druid worship.</v>

3269
02:24:37.320 --> 02:24:41.460
<v Speaker 6>The group insists that they're simply</v>
<v Speaker 6>revering the redwoods and other rituals,</v>

3270
02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:46.740

<v Speaker 6>meaning that business deals are to be</v>
<v Speaker 6>left outside.</v>

3277
02:25:06.930 --> 02:25:11.160

<v Speaker 4>real.</v>

<v Speaker 4>that you were in.</v>

3295
02:26:03.860 --> 02:26:04.990

<v Speaker 4>Actually.</v>

3296
02:26:04.991 --> 02:26:07.100
<v Speaker 4>I pulled everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had a great line in it.</v>

3297
02:26:09.040 --> 02:26:11.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to say what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you talking about?</v>

<v Speaker 4>What are you talking about from movie</v>

3299
02:26:15.930 --> 02:26:16.763
<v Speaker 4>deal?</v>

3300
02:26:17.470 --> 02:26:18.550
<v Speaker 4>They put up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is it?</v>

3301
02:26:18.551 --> 02:26:21.340
<v Speaker 4>Took it down their road movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why they took it down?</v>

3302
02:26:21.430 --> 02:26:23.140
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the rose took it though,</v>

3303
02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:25.660
<v Speaker 4>but they put it up there was somebody</v>
<v Speaker 4>else put it up.</v>

3304
02:26:25.690 --> 02:26:28.450
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's a leaked a trailer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3305
02:26:28.451 --> 02:26:30.040
<v Speaker 4>how do you leak a trailer?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3306
02:26:30.041 --> 02:26:33.280
<v Speaker 4>somebody that's paid to edit it and gets</v>
<v Speaker 4>paid $10 an hour and he just puts it</v>

3307
02:26:33.281 --> 02:26:36.490
<v Speaker 4>online or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he made his own trailer.</v>

3308
02:26:36.520 --> 02:26:39.970
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing how he gets paid to do it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's probably at home sitting in</v>

3309
02:26:39.971 --> 02:26:40.804
<v Speaker 4>Burbank.</v>

3310
02:26:41.600 --> 02:26:44.620
<v Speaker 4>The story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's something fucking unique when like</v>

3311
02:26:44.660 --> 02:26:48.770
<v Speaker 4>the high level people who robbed those</v>
<v Speaker 4>movies that don't rob the movie from the</v>

3312
02:26:48.771 --> 02:26:50.840
<v Speaker 4>movie theater with the camera no more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3313
02:26:51.260 --> 02:26:54.080
<v Speaker 4>they robbed him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They tap into Warner brothers or Fox.</v>

3314
02:26:54.820 --> 02:26:57.560
<v Speaker 4>They all Shoney.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They tapped him like the week before the</v>

3315
02:26:57.561 --> 02:27:00.890
<v Speaker 4>movie gets released or a month before it</v>

3329
02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:40.670
<v Speaker 4>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had a cover that was a copy of the</v>

<v Speaker 4>real cover and it was like obviously</v>

3331
02:27:43.940 --> 02:27:46.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a common computer printer copy.</v>

3332
02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:50.360
<v Speaker 4>I made good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe allegedly made great money selling</v>

3333
02:27:50.840 --> 02:27:53.180
<v Speaker 4>pop fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bootlegs on campus.</v>

3334
02:27:53.960 --> 02:27:55.820
<v Speaker 4>I've never bought a fucking illegal</v>
<v Speaker 4>film.</v>

3335
02:27:56.510 --> 02:27:58.460
<v Speaker 4>I was always scared to stop for those</v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

3336
02:27:59.500 --> 02:28:03.200
<v Speaker 4>especially in New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was always just don't stop just</v>

3337
02:28:03.260 --> 02:28:05.750
<v Speaker 4>sketching out a whole fucking problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

3338
02:28:05.751 --> 02:28:07.670
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot of times I bought them and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were empty.</v>

3339
02:28:07.730 --> 02:28:12.730
<v Speaker 4>There was nothing there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew guys in the 70s taking boxes like</v>

3340
02:28:12.831 --> 02:28:17.230
<v Speaker 4>crazy Eddie and putting fucking bricks</v>
<v Speaker 4>in them and wrapping them at home and</v>

3341
02:28:17.270 --> 02:28:19.370
<v Speaker 4>they're in a corner and also can you</v>
<v Speaker 4>pull up and you're like,</v>

3342
02:28:19.371 --> 02:28:20.000
<v Speaker 4>what do you got?</v>

3343
02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:20.860
<v Speaker 4>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>speakers,</v>

3344
02:28:20.870 --> 02:28:24.170
<v Speaker 4>$50 at 200 of the event,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to unwrap them.</v>

3345
02:28:24.200 --> 02:28:24.940
<v Speaker 4>They're wrapped,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3346
02:28:24.940 --> 02:28:26.900
<v Speaker 4>put them in your car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to get to fucking bricks.</v>

3347
02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:28.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was real common.</v>

3348
02:28:28.410 --> 02:28:31.070
<v Speaker 4>The pulling up and asking you if you</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to buy some stereotypes.</v>

3349
02:28:31.790 --> 02:28:32.930
<v Speaker 4>We had some extras.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3350
02:28:32.931 --> 02:28:35.090
<v Speaker 4>I don't want nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want nothing to go keep driving.</v>

3351
02:28:35.630 --> 02:28:37.340
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had that crazy Eddie's story.</v>

3352
02:28:37.341 --> 02:28:39.470
<v Speaker 4>That was brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a weird thing about urban</v>

3353
02:28:39.471 --> 02:28:40.340
<v Speaker 4>environments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

3354
02:28:40.380 --> 02:28:41.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can always,</v>

3355
02:28:42.060 --> 02:28:43.860
<v Speaker 4>it's always a scam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's getting rough.</v>

3356
02:28:43.880 --> 02:28:46.400
<v Speaker 4>But I knew that was one point where the</v>
<v Speaker 4>scam went south.</v>

3357
02:28:46.760 --> 02:28:49.850
<v Speaker 4>There was one point where I heard you</v>
<v Speaker 4>hear shit that people were selling</v>

3358
02:28:49.851 --> 02:28:51.980
<v Speaker 4>thermostats and the glass is broken,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3359
02:28:52.370 --> 02:28:53.390
<v Speaker 4>and then you just say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck it.</v>

3360
02:28:53.660 --> 02:28:57.920
<v Speaker 4>Why even started going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might get a great deal or I might get</v>

3361
02:28:57.921 --> 02:28:58.410
<v Speaker 4>bullshit.</v>

3362

<v Speaker 4>fucking guy in the next day for $8 is it</v>

3363
02:29:01.851 --> 02:29:03.350
<v Speaker 4>really worth the aggravation?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

3364
02:29:03.680 --> 02:29:07.850
<v Speaker 4>But I remember going back to New York in</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] 94 after I got divorced and</v>

3365
02:29:07.940 --> 02:29:11.720

<v Speaker 4>the top two floors.</v>

3370
02:29:20.151 --> 02:29:23.170
<v Speaker 4>But like going into the gap.</v>

<v Speaker 4>was growing up.</v>

3385
02:29:54.981 --> 02:29:57.230
<v Speaker 4>They pull up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but type of guys from the neighborhood</v>

<v Speaker 4>shit every fucking Thursday.</v>

3388
02:30:05.130 --> 02:30:07.190
<v Speaker 4>They ain't got shit every fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thursday when like a big,</v>

3389
02:30:07.580 --> 02:30:11.600
<v Speaker 4>when I was a kid fucking the trains</v>
<v Speaker 4>would move Honda many trails and the</v>

3390
02:30:11.601 --> 02:30:13.990
<v Speaker 4>many trails or the best motorcycle you</v>
<v Speaker 4>could buy for a kid.</v>

3391
02:30:13.991 --> 02:30:18.200
<v Speaker 4>We didn't have balls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was 50 it was 50 cc and it was</v>

3392
02:30:18.201 --> 02:30:19.370
<v Speaker 4>automatic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had one,</v>

3393
02:30:19.970 --> 02:30:22.850
<v Speaker 4>I bought one for real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My mother bought me one for real and</v>

3394
02:30:22.851 --> 02:30:26.060
<v Speaker 4>then we found out that you could steal</v>
<v Speaker 4>them off the train that came through</v>

3395
02:30:26.080 --> 02:30:28.880
<v Speaker 4>Erie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lackawanna and you would go down there</v>

3396
02:30:28.910 --> 02:30:31.190
<v Speaker 4>and somebody would jump on the train and</v>
<v Speaker 4>break the seal,</v>

3397
02:30:31.850 --> 02:30:33.650
<v Speaker 4>take the shit off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thrown into the weeds.</v>

3398
02:30:33.980 --> 02:30:36.380
<v Speaker 4>And then somebody had have to come back</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a truck because in those days you</v>

3399
02:30:36.381 --> 02:30:37.590
<v Speaker 4>put those together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't come.</v>

3400
02:30:37.591 --> 02:30:39.620
<v Speaker 4>And built.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Tigers won,</v>

3401
02:30:39.650 --> 02:30:41.960
<v Speaker 4>the bottom was on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to put the seed on,</v>

3402
02:30:42.340 --> 02:30:44.900
<v Speaker 4>got to put the steering wheel on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta put all that shit on him.</v>

3403
02:30:45.200 --> 02:30:47.840
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we found that when they were coming</v>

3404
02:30:47.841 --> 02:30:49.940
<v Speaker 4>in and you take three or four of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep one,</v>

3405
02:30:50.560 --> 02:30:52.610
<v Speaker 4>all three of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were 200 retail.</v>

3406
02:30:52.640 --> 02:30:56.190
<v Speaker 4>So that meant they were probably $85.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's in there?</v>

3407
02:30:56.191 --> 02:30:58.920
<v Speaker 4>Like a big amount of profit for like</v>
<v Speaker 4>some organized crime in New York.</v>

3408
02:30:58.921 --> 02:31:01.550
<v Speaker 4>Cause they get steal things off the</v>
<v Speaker 4>docks and then resell them someplace.</v>

3409
02:31:02.520 --> 02:31:06.110
<v Speaker 4>It costs you nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It costs you nothing.</v>

3410
02:31:07.490 --> 02:31:09.050
<v Speaker 4>You could sell it for whatever the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want.</v>

3411
02:31:10.760 --> 02:31:13.640
<v Speaker 4>You can undercut everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do you think stealing cocaine in the</v>

3412
02:31:13.640 --> 02:31:16.080
<v Speaker 4>80s are so popular?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I control the mark.</v>

3413
02:31:16.090 --> 02:31:18.890
<v Speaker 4>I just got 30 kilos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you're going to pay 44.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you would buy something that was stolen.</v>

3416
02:31:26.040 --> 02:31:28.050
<v Speaker 1>As soon as I moved to California and</v>
<v Speaker 1>start really,</v>

3567
02:38:05.361 --> 02:38:08.960
<v Speaker 6>thinking this is no better place to stay</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the store basement at the comedy</v>

<v Speaker 6>I'm shit my pants called call the bow.</v>

3570
02:38:14.480 --> 02:38:18.950
<v Speaker 6>You should tell a story on stage about</v>
<v Speaker 6>how the time where when he was young,</v>

3571
02:38:18.951 --> 02:38:20.600

<v Speaker 6>some day.</v>

3572
02:38:20.880 --> 02:38:22.100
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when he was young,</v>

3573
02:38:22.550 --> 02:38:25.340
<v Speaker 6>he was staying at the store and he's out</v>
<v Speaker 6>of the store.</v>

3574
02:38:25.340 --> 02:38:28.580
<v Speaker 6>Like his wife kicked him out or</v>
<v Speaker 6>something like that and he got,</v>

3575
02:38:28.670 --> 02:38:31.010
<v Speaker 6>it was forced to stay at the store.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was sleeping on the stage.</v>

3593
02:39:07.941 --> 02:39:11.020
<v Speaker 6>and then out of nowhere,</v>
<v Speaker 6>two hands grabbed his legs and dragged</v>

3594
02:39:11.021 --> 02:39:15.530
<v Speaker 6>them to the edge of the stairs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he said there was no one there.</v>

3595
02:39:15.740 --> 02:39:18.890
<v Speaker 6>He said he didn't see anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>By the time he got up,</v>

3715
02:44:51.301 --> 02:44:55.350
<v Speaker 6>that Don Barris without wearing a</v>
<v Speaker 6>costume is doing this in a jumpsuit.</v>

3717
02:44:59.761 --> 02:45:01.830
<v Speaker 6>this role where he could pose cock out</v>
<v Speaker 6>really easy.</v>

3718
02:45:01.860 --> 02:45:02.520

<v Speaker 6>I don't want,</v>

3724
02:45:14.610 --> 02:45:18.060
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to get depressed.</v>
