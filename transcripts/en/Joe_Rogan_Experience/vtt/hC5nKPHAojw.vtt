1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.930
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience with one of the things that you've realized.</v>

2
00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:06.360
<v Speaker 1>And I've realized over the course of our friendship,</v>

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean Eddie's been my best friend since I think 2000.</v>

4
00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:11.480
<v Speaker 1>We started hanging out in 2018 which is,</v>

5
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.401
<v Speaker 1>comes back to the,</v>

6
00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:14.660
<v Speaker 1>it comes back to the story of the twister because it is,</v>

7
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:15.960
<v Speaker 1>that'd be we became good friends.</v>

8
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.981
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

10
00:00:16.981 --> 00:00:17.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.521
<v Speaker 1>getting,</v>

12
00:00:17.521 --> 00:00:17.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.970
<v Speaker 1>private lessons when I first started doing Jujitsu.</v>

15
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.660
<v Speaker 1>I was a blue belt onto this dude.</v>

16
00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:22.980
<v Speaker 1>I won't say his name is a very nice guy,</v>

17
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.270
<v Speaker 1>but it's an,</v>

18
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna say something negative and I was,</v>

19
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.130
<v Speaker 1>because I was getting a private lessons from him all the time.</v>

20
00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:32.040
<v Speaker 1>He was the only guy that I was rolling with and I wasn't really learning nearly</v>

21
00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:32.850
<v Speaker 1>as much as I thought.</v>

22
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.740
<v Speaker 1>I thought like if your kickboxing,</v>

23
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.281
<v Speaker 1>and like you say,</v>

24
00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:36.840
<v Speaker 1>if you get a chance to work out with rob came in,</v>

25
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.260
<v Speaker 1>it's way better to work out with rob came in one on one than it is to go to a</v>

26
00:00:40.261 --> 00:00:41.010
<v Speaker 1>private class.</v>

27
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Like he's going to correct all your technique.</v>

28
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.520
<v Speaker 1>So I thought that would be the case with Jujitsu.</v>

29
00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:47.520
<v Speaker 1>Like I would get really good going to class and ain't like that at Eddie was the</v>

30
00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:48.420
<v Speaker 1>first person to tell me.</v>

31
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.230
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

32
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.750
<v Speaker 1>Eddie came to a,</v>

33
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.950
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

34
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.670
<v Speaker 1>one of the private lessons that I was having one Silvio and we rolled around a</v>

35
00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:55.530
<v Speaker 1>little bit and white away.</v>

36
00:00:55.531 --> 00:00:58.800
<v Speaker 1>He got me in a twister and I had no idea what the fuck he's doing.</v>

37
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.580
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden he hooks my knee with his left leg and his left foot goes under</v>

38
00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:06.300
<v Speaker 1>his right knee and he rolls forward under his left shoulder and I'm spinning</v>

39
00:01:06.301 --> 00:01:07.200
<v Speaker 1>around like a top.</v>

40
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.500
<v Speaker 1>And next thing I know he's got my arm wrapped around his neck and he's fucking</v>

41
00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:11.640
<v Speaker 1>pulling on my neck like this.</v>

42
00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:11.911
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

43
00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:13.650
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck did you just do?</v>

44
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.940
<v Speaker 1>Like I had been doing Jujitsu for two years and I had no idea what the fuck you</v>

45
00:01:17.941 --> 00:01:18.774
<v Speaker 1>just did to me.</v>

46
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.441
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

47
00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:20.221
<v Speaker 1>God damn.</v>

48
00:01:20.221 --> 00:01:20.641
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

49
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:21.450
<v Speaker 1>I'll teach you all this shit.</v>

50
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.900
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

51
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.381
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

52
00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:23.280
<v Speaker 1>teach me this shit.</v>

53
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's how we became friends.</v>

54
00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:27.360
<v Speaker 1>And that's also how I started smoking pot.</v>

55
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.901
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

56
00:01:27.901 --> 00:01:31.110
<v Speaker 1>I was on the Mark Marin podcast the other day and this came up.</v>

57
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

58
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.370
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

60
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.760
<v Speaker 1>I've thought that marijuana and all that stuff was for losers.</v>

61
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:37.170
<v Speaker 1>I thought that it just made you a loser.</v>

62
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.850
<v Speaker 1>You're just going to become unmotivated.</v>

63
00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:39.810
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to get anything done.</v>

64
00:01:39.811 --> 00:01:41.700
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be a dummy and just sit and watch TV.</v>

65
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.631
<v Speaker 1>That's not what I wanted,</v>

66
00:01:42.631 --> 00:01:42.811
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

67
00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:43.590
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to make sure.</v>

68
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.760

<v Speaker 1>Like he just does not want to slow it down and we're like,</v>

91
00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:18.840
<v Speaker 1>it ain't about slowing down man.</v>

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:19.351
<v Speaker 1>It's not about,</v>

93
00:02:19.351 --> 00:02:20.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm not slowing down.</v>

94
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.150
<v Speaker 1>I haven't slowed down at all.</v>

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.980
<v Speaker 1>I work more now than I ever did before.</v>

96
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm a busy mother fucker.</v>

97
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.990
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

98
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.040
<v Speaker 1>This is not an annoying goddamn stereotype that potheads or are lazy.</v>

99
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.420
<v Speaker 1>We get a lot of shit done,</v>

100
00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:30.900
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

101
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing two podcasts a week.</v>

102
00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:33.061
<v Speaker 1>I'm writing a book,</v>

103
00:02:33.061 --> 00:02:34.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm writing my standup comedy,</v>

104
00:02:34.351 --> 00:02:37.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm performing standup comedy and I'm doing standup.</v>

105
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing the commentary for the number one mixed martial arts organization in</v>

106
00:02:40.711 --> 00:02:41.251
<v Speaker 1>the fucking world,</v>

107
00:02:41.251 --> 00:02:44.910
<v Speaker 1>and I'm training Jujitsu and I'm doing kettlebells and I'm raising kids and I</v>

108
00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:48.270
<v Speaker 1>play pool every night and I got to surf the Internet and I've got to beat off.</v>

109
00:02:48.271 --> 00:02:49.410
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of shit going on,</v>

110
00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:49.561
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

111
00:02:49.561 --> 00:02:50.520
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of God damn time.</v>

112
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm not lazy at all.</v>

113
00:02:51.631 --> 00:02:53.040
<v Speaker 1>I squeezed it all out every day.</v>

114
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.860
<v Speaker 1>So when people say that potheads you know that it makes you lazy.</v>

115
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.720
<v Speaker 1>It's just a stereotype man.</v>

116
00:02:57.721 --> 00:02:58.950
<v Speaker 1>And that was a stereotype that I,</v>

117
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.050
<v Speaker 1>before I met you,</v>

118
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

119
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.800
<v Speaker 2>I do sleep till about 10 45 every day.</v>

120
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.710
<v Speaker 2>So what time do you go to bed?</v>

121
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 2>Two or three.</v>

122
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.861
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

123
00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:06.730
<v Speaker 2>that's like eight hours.</v>

124
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:07.600
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're supposed to get,</v>

125
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:08.050
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

126
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.180
<v Speaker 2>Most of these people were in bed at 10 o'clock at night.</v>

127
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 2>That's why when they get up at six o'clock in the morning,</v>

128
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:13.060
<v Speaker 2>they were all impressed with themselves.</v>

129
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.441
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

130
00:03:13.441 --> 00:03:13.651
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

131
00:03:13.651 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 2>bitch,</v>

132
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 2>I slept a one 30 in the afternoon.</v>

133
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 2>But where were you at 5:00 AM?</v>

134
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:19.210
<v Speaker 2>I was writing the greatest bit I've ever written in my life.</v>

135
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.541
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

136
00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:20.770
<v Speaker 2>That's why I write my best shit.</v>

137
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.740
<v Speaker 2>I was in the fucking isolation tank traveling through the universe.</v>

138
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.250
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

139
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.780
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was doing while you were sleeping.</v>

140
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.940
<v Speaker 2>So then give me a hard time because my time is different than your time.</v>

141
00:03:28.941 --> 00:03:29.774
<v Speaker 2>Like somehow or another,</v>

142
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:30.401
<v Speaker 2>you know you,</v>

143
00:03:30.401 --> 00:03:32.710
<v Speaker 2>you were fucking doing yoga at 5:00 AM so you're the king.</v>

144
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:33.191
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

145
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:33.641
<v Speaker 2>Stupid.</v>

146
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:35.530
<v Speaker 2>And it's all based on farmers anyway.</v>

147
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:37.970
<v Speaker 2>It's based on farms.</v>

148
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.700
<v Speaker 2>You have to fucking get up early.</v>

149
00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:41.380
<v Speaker 2>That's nonsense asleep.</v>

150
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.630
<v Speaker 2>The crazy thing is a Joe and I,</v>

151
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:45.220
<v Speaker 2>before we started smoking weed,</v>

152
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.570
<v Speaker 2>we were totally against it.</v>

153
00:03:46.571 --> 00:03:49.430
<v Speaker 2>We would bag on stoners and we thought it made you stupid.</v>

154
00:03:49.431 --> 00:03:52.160
<v Speaker 2>And I would talk so much shit on stone.</v>

155
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.260
<v Speaker 2>Or is that at 28?</v>

156
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 2>That's when I found out the truth.</v>

157
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.370
<v Speaker 2>That's when I reaped the benefits of marijuana.</v>

158
00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:58.690
<v Speaker 2>And then when I met Joe,</v>

159
00:03:58.691 --> 00:03:59.800
<v Speaker 2>he was so funny.</v>

160
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 2>I thought this guy's got a smoke pot.</v>

161
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:02.770
<v Speaker 2>He's so funny.</v>

162
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:03.660
<v Speaker 2>Like I go see him,</v>

163
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:04.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

164
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.770
<v Speaker 2>do stand up at the comedy store.</v>

165
00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:06.131
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

166
00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:08.380
<v Speaker 2>that's that dude who trains at John Jack Machado's.</v>

167
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.191
<v Speaker 2>He trains at my school.</v>

168
00:04:09.191 --> 00:04:09.311
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

169
00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:09.821
<v Speaker 2>what's up dude,</v>

170
00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:10.660
<v Speaker 2>I train at your school.</v>

171
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:11.651
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

172
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:12.490
<v Speaker 2>watch them do comedy.</v>

173
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:13.323
<v Speaker 2>And I thought he was critical.</v>

174
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.410
<v Speaker 2>He's got a smoking.</v>

175
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.320
<v Speaker 2>Eddie and I had a bunch of fortuitous meetings just out of the,</v>

176
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.360
<v Speaker 2>out of the blue before we became friends.</v>

177
00:04:19.361 --> 00:04:19.910
<v Speaker 2>At one time.</v>

178
00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.070
<v Speaker 2>Eddie's eyes aren't so good.</v>

179
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 2>And one time we were at a,</v>

180
00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:22.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

181
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.240
<v Speaker 2>at Mel's diner and it was late at night,</v>

182
00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:25.451
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

183
00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:26.590
<v Speaker 2>it was like one o'clock in the morning.</v>

184
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.131
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

185
00:04:27.131 --> 00:04:27.430
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>

186
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.680

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.310
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

188
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.020
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

189
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.853
<v Speaker 2>Yo Eddie.</v>

190
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:30.250
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

191
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.461
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

192
00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:31.810
<v Speaker 2>who's this motherfucker talking to me,</v>

193
00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:32.051
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

194
00:04:32.051 --> 00:04:35.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have to fight this dude in front of my chick that's remember that.</v>

195
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

196
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.730
<v Speaker 2>you remember that?</v>

197
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.941
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

198
00:04:36.941 --> 00:04:37.301
<v Speaker 2>You taught,</v>

199
00:04:37.301 --> 00:04:39.370
<v Speaker 2>I was like some dude who's just fucking with you.</v>

200
00:04:39.371 --> 00:04:40.540
<v Speaker 2>So I had it down.</v>

201
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

202
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.913
<v Speaker 2>I thought you were.</v>

203
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.310
<v Speaker 2>Cause I was with the check and I thought you were saying something to the check.</v>

204
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

205
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.930
<v Speaker 2>You didn't hear what I was saying and you can't see that good.</v>

206
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.160
<v Speaker 2>So he couldn't see me from a distance.</v>

207
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.570
<v Speaker 2>So by the time I came up to your table,</v>

208
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:50.710
<v Speaker 2>Chris's mother Fucker,</v>

209
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.190
<v Speaker 2>and then you'll,</v>

210
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.431
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

211
00:04:51.431 --> 00:04:52.264
<v Speaker 2>hey dude,</v>

212
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.670
<v Speaker 2>I didn't watch news radio.</v>

213
00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:56.650
<v Speaker 2>And at that point it was before a fear factor.</v>

214
00:04:56.651 --> 00:04:58.930
<v Speaker 2>So I never watched news radio.</v>

215
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.490
<v Speaker 2>And so I was like,</v>

216
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.731
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

217
00:05:00.731 --> 00:05:02.260
<v Speaker 2>I hear he's an actor or something,</v>

218
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.210
<v Speaker 2>like I barely remember it.</v>

219
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.300
<v Speaker 2>But then when I saw you at the college,</v>

220
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.570
<v Speaker 2>that was by luck to,</v>

221
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.010
<v Speaker 2>you didn't come there with me.</v>

222
00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:09.641
<v Speaker 2>You just came.</v>

223
00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:09.851
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

224
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:13.450
<v Speaker 2>It was just I want to go see come cause right when I started smoking weed,</v>

225
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.780
<v Speaker 2>I began to appreciate comedy way more cause we'd better all of a sudden my mind</v>

226
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.440
<v Speaker 2>figured out how to write comedy.</v>

227
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.711
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

228
00:05:23.711 --> 00:05:24.730
<v Speaker 2>When I started smoking weed,</v>

229
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.440
<v Speaker 2>I never understood.</v>

230
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:27.430
<v Speaker 2>I was fascinated with comedy,</v>

231
00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:28.960
<v Speaker 2>but I never understood how they put bits together.</v>

232
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.490
<v Speaker 2>I didn't understand the setup.</v>

233
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.440
<v Speaker 2>I didn't understand the structure of comedy.</v>

234
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:33.970
<v Speaker 2>But as soon as I start smoking weed,</v>

235
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

236
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.620
<v Speaker 2>I know where they're doing.</v>

237
00:05:35.621 --> 00:05:38.680
<v Speaker 2>I know what they're doing now they're doing this and they're taking that and</v>

238
00:05:38.681 --> 00:05:39.130
<v Speaker 2>then do it.</v>

239
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.700
<v Speaker 2>So I understood the basic foreign layer.</v>

240
00:05:40.701 --> 00:05:43.030
<v Speaker 2>So I just became fascinated and then I saw you.</v>

241
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

242
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.520
<v Speaker 2>does that do for my Jujitsu school?</v>

243
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.400
<v Speaker 2>He's an actor and you killed me.</v>

244
00:05:47.401 --> 00:05:47.900
<v Speaker 2>You were just,</v>

245
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.280
<v Speaker 2>you were all nothing but dick jokes and like relationship jokes,</v>

246
00:05:51.281 --> 00:05:52.120
<v Speaker 2>chick jokes,</v>

247
00:05:52.121 --> 00:05:52.954
<v Speaker 2>dating Joe.</v>

248
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.130
<v Speaker 2>But you would kill in it.</v>

249
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.000
<v Speaker 2>And then when you came,</v>

250
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.811
<v Speaker 2>you walked off stage.</v>

251
00:05:55.811 --> 00:05:55.991
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

252
00:05:55.991 --> 00:05:56.680
<v Speaker 2>hey dude,</v>

253

257
00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:02.990
<v Speaker 1>then that's when he invited me to give him a private or something.</v>

258

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:45.770
<v Speaker 3>11th grade lunch,</v>

369
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:47.570
<v Speaker 3>there was a big stoner crowd.</v>

370
00:08:47.571 --> 00:08:50.150
<v Speaker 3>There's probably like a hundred people in the stoner crowd and everyone thought</v>

371
00:08:50.151 --> 00:08:52.370
<v Speaker 3>I was a stoner cause I hung out in the stoner crowd.</v>

372
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.080
<v Speaker 3>But if you look closely,</v>

373
00:08:54.081 --> 00:08:55.830
<v Speaker 3>I was like on edge.</v>

374
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.530
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't really in with those guys,</v>

<v Speaker 3>That wasn't really it.</v>

377
00:08:59.091 --> 00:08:59.970
<v Speaker 3>It appeared I was,</v>

378
00:08:59.971 --> 00:09:01.220
<v Speaker 3>but actually wasn't hanging out with them.</v>

00:09:01.221 --> 00:09:02.700
<v Speaker 3>It's just me and three other guys on the side.</v>

380
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:06.420
<v Speaker 3>And one day I got pulled into the crowd and they're passing around a joint and I</v>

381
00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:06.661

384
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.050
<v Speaker 3>I was kind of like stoked that they pulled me in,</v>

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.080

408
00:09:34.081 --> 00:09:34.860
<v Speaker 3>just look straight.</v>

409
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:35.693

00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:37.831
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not.</v>

414
00:09:37.831 --> 00:09:38.491

415
00:09:38.491 --> 00:09:39.240
<v Speaker 3>No one's going to go.</v>

416
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.210

<v Speaker 3>So he brought me to the principal's office.</v>

477
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.140
<v Speaker 3>He had a to pay on.</v>

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:23.730
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

487
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:24.930
<v Speaker 3>and the cop was like,</v>

488
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:26.370
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't buying it at all,</v>

489
00:11:26.371 --> 00:11:28.350
<v Speaker 3>but the principal just looked at me and said,</v>

490
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.983
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

491

<v Speaker 3>And he just let me go home.</v>

493
00:11:33.061 --> 00:11:35.250
<v Speaker 3>And I just walked home like all fucked up.</v>

494
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:36.120
<v Speaker 3>I got home,</v>

495
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:40.410
<v Speaker 3>just laid down on my bed and I'll never forget looking at the VCR clock,</v>

496
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.050
<v Speaker 3>just watching the minutes click by just,</v>

497
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.943
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't wait.</v>

498
00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.200
<v Speaker 3>It just seemed like it was going to last forever.</v>

499
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:49.230
<v Speaker 3>Just watching the clock please feeling go away.</v>

500
00:11:49.231 --> 00:11:50.340
<v Speaker 3>I hate this feeling.</v>

501
00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:51.563
<v Speaker 3>I hated it.</v>

502
00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:52.321
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

503
00:11:52.321 --> 00:11:54.580
<v Speaker 3>I only got high maybe a dozen</v>

504
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.540
<v Speaker 1>times before I started getting high with you over the course of my whole life.</v>

505
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:02.950
<v Speaker 1>But one time I did when I was 15 with this girl that I dated,</v>

506
00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:04.120
<v Speaker 1>she was a,</v>

507
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:04.421
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

508
00:12:04.421 --> 00:12:06.550
<v Speaker 1>it was her idea and my friend Josh,</v>

509
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:11.670
<v Speaker 1>we all three of us got high together and I was probably like 1514 maybe 1415 and</v>

510
00:12:13.001 --> 00:12:14.050
<v Speaker 1>I stole my dad's.</v>

511
00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:14.923
<v Speaker 1>We'd,</v>

512
00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:17.920
<v Speaker 1>he had some super strong weed,</v>

513
00:12:17.921 --> 00:12:18.520
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

514
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:18.821
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

515
00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:19.560
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

516
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:19.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

517
00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:20.171
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

518
00:12:20.171 --> 00:12:21.160
<v Speaker 1>I was a little kid,</v>

519
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:21.760
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

520
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.020
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know how we smoked it.</v>

521
00:12:23.021 --> 00:12:23.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember anything,</v>

522
00:12:23.891 --> 00:12:26.980
<v Speaker 1>but what I do remember is just lying on the couch.</v>

523
00:12:26.981 --> 00:12:29.650
<v Speaker 1>My whole body just tangling,</v>

524
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:34.420
<v Speaker 1>like little electrical circuits are going off and my whole body and then I was</v>

525
00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:35.290
<v Speaker 1>time traveling.</v>

526
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:35.890
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

527
00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:39.610
<v Speaker 1>I would be on my back on the couch and then boom,</v>

528
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:42.760
<v Speaker 1>I'd be in front of the fridgerator and I had no recollection of how I got there.</v>

529
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.600
<v Speaker 1>It was like instantly I appeared in front of the refrigerator and then boom,</v>

530
00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.940
<v Speaker 1>I was in the bedroom and I couldn't remember walking to the bedroom.</v>

531
00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:54.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like my short term memory was so fucked that every few steps,</v>

532
00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.230
<v Speaker 1>my whole brain just rebooted and I'm like,</v>

533
00:12:56.231 --> 00:12:57.064
<v Speaker 1>how did I get here?</v>

534
00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.770
<v Speaker 1>Erased all the steps up to get to that point.</v>

535
00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.790
<v Speaker 1>There was no memory.</v>

536
00:13:00.791 --> 00:13:02.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean my brain was fucked.</v>

537
00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:03.430
<v Speaker 1>We both fucked.</v>

538
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:04.600
<v Speaker 1>We're giggling,</v>

539
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.000
<v Speaker 1>but I was scared of weed after that for awhile.</v>

540
00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:09.520
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do it again for for a long time.</v>

541
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:09.871
<v Speaker 1>That was a,</v>

542
00:13:09.871 --> 00:13:10.840
<v Speaker 1>that was a scary one.</v>

543
00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:11.730

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:12.250
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

545
00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.370
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe that people could function and smoke weed.</v>

546
00:13:15.371 --> 00:13:18.820
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get it guys in the bands that I was in growing up,</v>

547
00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:22.850

<v Speaker 1>to Joey Diaz,</v>

607
00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.130
<v Speaker 1>Indians and Mexicans are related.</v>

608
00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:53.600

<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

829
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:17.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit.</v>

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.090
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck did this happen?</v>

831
00:19:18.091 --> 00:19:19.800
<v Speaker 2>So I'm trying to remember what the fuck happened.</v>

832
00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:20.843
<v Speaker 2>I opened up my,</v>

833
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:21.691

837
00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.610
<v Speaker 2>my extra shoes in my suitcase,</v>

838
00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:28.350
<v Speaker 2>always I pocket certainly all the time.</v>

839
00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:31.710
<v Speaker 2>There's one shoe in my backpack and I,</v>

840
00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:33.840
<v Speaker 2>and I always keep my computer in my backpack.</v>

841
00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:34.141
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

842
00:19:34.141 --> 00:19:34.974
<v Speaker 2>where's my computer?</v>

843
00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:36.960
<v Speaker 2>My computer is in my suitcase.</v>

844
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:40.470
<v Speaker 2>So in a drunken stupor I just must have just grabbed everything,</v>

845
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:43.260
<v Speaker 2>put shit in like a Zombie pack.</v>

846
00:19:43.261 --> 00:19:44.970
<v Speaker 2>Shit up like a fucking idiot.</v>

847
00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:46.260
<v Speaker 2>And I woke,</v>

848
00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:49.440
<v Speaker 2>I wake up in the back of this card and then I find that Joe kept calling and I</v>

849
00:19:49.441 --> 00:19:50.101
<v Speaker 2>didn't know what to say.</v>

850
00:19:50.101 --> 00:19:51.540
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what the fuck was going on.</v>

851
00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:52.770
<v Speaker 2>I needed time to think.</v>

852
00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:53.940
<v Speaker 2>So I finally answered.</v>

853
00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:54.421
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

854
00:19:54.421 --> 00:19:54.630
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

855
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:55.141
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

856
00:19:55.141 --> 00:19:56.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how this happened.</v>

857
00:19:56.281 --> 00:19:59.040
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea how I ended up in the back of this car.</v>

858
00:19:59.310 --> 00:19:59.760
<v Speaker 2>We get,</v>

859
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:00.001
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

860
00:20:00.001 --> 00:20:02.400
<v Speaker 2>and he ended up getting a cab and at the airport,</v>

861
00:20:02.401 --> 00:20:03.660
<v Speaker 2>Joe is so mad at me,</v>

862
00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:04.830
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't talk to me.</v>

863
00:20:04.831 --> 00:20:06.030
<v Speaker 2>He was so pissed off.</v>

864
00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:07.500
<v Speaker 2>I was just so ridiculous.</v>

865
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.230
<v Speaker 2>It was the second time in a row we went traveling internationally.</v>

866
00:20:12.231 --> 00:20:15.690
<v Speaker 2>The second time I had a babysitter who was from England to this.</v>

867
00:20:15.691 --> 00:20:16.201
<v Speaker 2>It was just like,</v>

868
00:20:16.201 --> 00:20:16.861
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

869
00:20:16.861 --> 00:20:17.694

873
00:20:21.811 --> 00:20:24.130
<v Speaker 2>You're the first guy that I ever met where I used to sell.</v>

874
00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:24.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

875
00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:24.871
<v Speaker 2>people say,</v>

876
00:20:24.871 --> 00:20:25.321
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

877
00:20:25.321 --> 00:20:26.460
<v Speaker 2>I blackout when I get truck.</v>

878
00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:27.720
<v Speaker 2>Shut up their chain.</v>

879
00:20:27.721 --> 00:20:28.554
<v Speaker 2>Blacking out.</v>

880
00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.870
<v Speaker 2>You just pretending you're black and now cause it makes it convenient.</v>

881
00:20:30.871 --> 00:20:31.110
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

882
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:31.790
<v Speaker 2>well you know,</v>

883
00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:33.780
<v Speaker 2>I was just seeing the Indian come out man.</v>

884
00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:34.471
<v Speaker 2>But like I said,</v>

885
00:20:34.471 --> 00:20:36.240
<v Speaker 2>I never used to think that it was real.</v>

886
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:39.030
<v Speaker 2>I used to think that people would say that they blackout drunk and like,</v>

887
00:20:39.031 --> 00:20:39.720
<v Speaker 2>come on man.</v>

888
00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.270
<v Speaker 2>But I've looked into Eddie's eyes and I see durables.</v>

889
00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:45.130
<v Speaker 2>I see dribble eyes like you ever look at a dribble size.</v>

890
00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 2>They're just black and dark and you don't know what's going on there.</v>

891
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:48.970
<v Speaker 2>Mostly nothing.</v>

892
00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:49.720
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

893
00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.460
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know Eddie was Mexican.</v>

894
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:53.530
<v Speaker 2>I thought he was fucking with me for like the first two years.</v>

895
00:20:53.531 --> 00:20:54.700
<v Speaker 2>Cause at the comedy store you're like,</v>

896
00:20:54.701 --> 00:20:55.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm half Mexican.</v>

897
00:20:55.611 --> 00:20:55.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

898
00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:55.961
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

899
00:20:55.961 --> 00:20:58.760
<v Speaker 2>you're nine Mexican or you said something like that to him.</v>

900
00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:00.300
<v Speaker 2>Then he used to say he was having,</v>

901
00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:00.881
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

902

<v Speaker 2>Japanese and health Eskimo or something like that.</v>

904
00:21:04.081 --> 00:21:05.830
<v Speaker 2>It was one and he said half Japanese,</v>

905
00:21:05.831 --> 00:21:06.760
<v Speaker 2>half Mexican or something.</v>

906
00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:11.980
<v Speaker 2>I used to say that when I was a teenager just because I was an idiot and I want</v>

907
00:21:11.981 --> 00:21:13.060
<v Speaker 2>her to see who would believe it.</v>

908
00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:13.751

909

912
00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:20.140

913
00:21:20.141 --> 00:21:21.910
<v Speaker 2>stories and see how far you can go with it.</v>

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:25.083
<v Speaker 2>the whole,</v>

917
00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:25.931
<v Speaker 2>the whole,</v>

918
00:21:25.931 --> 00:21:26.764
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

919
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.450
<v Speaker 2>why do you get into doing that,</v>

920
00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:29.470
<v Speaker 2>Matt?</v>

921
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:30.690
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a hard time not doing?</v>

922
00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:31.051
<v Speaker 2>You look at,</v>

923
00:21:31.051 --> 00:21:34.480
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the [inaudible] and then you look in and then you look at that,</v>

924
00:21:34.481 --> 00:21:35.590
<v Speaker 2>what we did on the Joe show,</v>

925
00:21:35.591 --> 00:21:39.400
<v Speaker 2>like with a 10 foot zip and the templates crews,</v>

926
00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.200
<v Speaker 2>let me tell people you don't know.</v>

927
00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:42.670
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you what we did.</v>

928
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
<v Speaker 2>We were in Denver and I was doing standup and Eddie and Tate and Brian and</v>

929
00:21:48.101 --> 00:21:48.620
<v Speaker 2>Duncan.</v>

930
00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:52.780
<v Speaker 2>We were all hanging out and we're walking and we went through this little</v>

931
00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:54.600
<v Speaker 2>shopping area that,</v>

932
00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:54.971
<v Speaker 2>what does it,</v>

933
00:21:54.971 --> 00:21:56.740
<v Speaker 2>those sixth street malls that what it's called,</v>

934
00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:57.640
<v Speaker 2>whatever the mall is,</v>

935
00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:58.623
<v Speaker 2>whatever street it is.</v>

936
00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:59.051
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

937
00:21:59.051 --> 00:22:03.550
<v Speaker 2>we're going to this downtown Shami here and we see a wig store 2005 2005 was it?</v>

938
00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:08.170
<v Speaker 2>And just as a goof we decided to go in this wig store and then first of all we</v>

939
00:22:08.171 --> 00:22:13.171
<v Speaker 2>were high as fuck and somewhere in this wig store we came up with the idea of</v>

940
00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.620
<v Speaker 2>having a fake band and that you guys were all going to wear these wigs.</v>

941
00:22:17.621 --> 00:22:17.990
<v Speaker 2>So we all,</v>

942
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.791
<v Speaker 2>everyone bought wigs.</v>

943
00:22:18.791 --> 00:22:23.791
<v Speaker 2>Tate had this crazy afro wig and you had this crazy wig and everyone decided</v>

944
00:22:24.581 --> 00:22:29.440
<v Speaker 2>that we were going to play a band called 10 foot screws and we even announced</v>

945
00:22:29.441 --> 00:22:32.950
<v Speaker 2>the band like as having an after party in town.</v>

946
00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:37.120
<v Speaker 2>So people thought that it was like a real band and Eddie goes on stage,</v>

947
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:38.290
<v Speaker 2>I get off stage,</v>

948
00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:43.320
<v Speaker 2>the show's over and he goes on stage with his fucking wig on and sunglasses we</v>

949
00:22:43.871 --> 00:22:45.250
<v Speaker 2>have video of it's still right.</v>

950
00:22:45.251 --> 00:22:45.421
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

951
00:22:45.421 --> 00:22:46.550
<v Speaker 2>Well there was a whole show.</v>

952
00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:49.690
<v Speaker 2>Which episode is it?</v>

953
00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:51.191
<v Speaker 2>Seven yeah.</v>

954
00:22:51.191 --> 00:22:52.240
<v Speaker 2>How do people find that one?</v>

955
00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:54.360
<v Speaker 2>Just type in Joe show seven but you know,</v>

956
00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.710
<v Speaker 2>all the episodes were on your website,</v>

957
00:22:56.711 --> 00:22:57.940
<v Speaker 2>but since you moved the servers,</v>

958
00:22:57.941 --> 00:22:59.290
<v Speaker 2>now everything is kind of weird.</v>

959
00:22:59.320 --> 00:22:59.591
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

960
00:22:59.591 --> 00:23:01.300
<v Speaker 2>there were probably getting too much bandwidth.</v>

961
00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:07.200
<v Speaker 2>The premise of it was Joe wanted to put together reality show based on him going</v>

962
00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:12.190
<v Speaker 2>to all these clubs across the nation and his posse and me,</v>

963
00:23:12.191 --> 00:23:13.000
<v Speaker 2>Tate,</v>

964
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:13.781
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

965
00:23:13.781 --> 00:23:14.321
<v Speaker 2>Dunkin,</v>

966
00:23:14.321 --> 00:23:15.154
<v Speaker 2>Ari,</v>

967
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:16.540
<v Speaker 2>even Larry back then,</v>

968
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.100
<v Speaker 2>we were all there as a producer.</v>

969
00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.713
<v Speaker 2>We were all in this.</v>

970
00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:20.691
<v Speaker 2>He was the producer.</v>

971
00:23:20.691 --> 00:23:24.310
<v Speaker 2>That's what Joe was the origin of the word powerful.</v>

972
00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:25.750
<v Speaker 2>When you hear me say powerful,</v>

973
00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.010
<v Speaker 2>it's all because there's one dude,</v>

974
00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:28.053
<v Speaker 2>our friend Lara.</v>

975
00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:28.991
<v Speaker 2>So the show,</v>

976
00:23:28.991 --> 00:23:29.621
<v Speaker 2>what was that called?</v>

977
00:23:29.621 --> 00:23:30.454
<v Speaker 2>The Joe show.</v>

978
00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:31.660
<v Speaker 2>We had her on your website.</v>

979
00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:34.450
<v Speaker 2>We did about 11 or 12 episodes or something,</v>

980
00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.910
<v Speaker 2>and episode seven we were in Denver.</v>

981
00:23:36.911 --> 00:23:40.330
<v Speaker 2>We were trying to come up with a pet premise and then it was,</v>

982
00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.260
<v Speaker 2>it was all about,</v>

983
00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:42.160
<v Speaker 2>we just,</v>

984
00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.390
<v Speaker 2>we just formed a band.</v>

985
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.130
<v Speaker 2>So Joe's on stage and we,</v>

986
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:49.460
<v Speaker 3>the way we sold it was Dunkin would get on stage and would say,</v>

987
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:50.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

988
00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:50.780
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

989
00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.420
<v Speaker 3>who's going to the 10 foot screws showed an I,</v>

990
00:23:53.421 --> 00:23:53.961
<v Speaker 3>that's what we call it,</v>

991
00:23:53.961 --> 00:23:55.010
<v Speaker 3>10 foot screws.</v>

992
00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:57.170
<v Speaker 3>And that was Brian's idea.</v>

993
00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:59.540
<v Speaker 3>And so we wanted to,</v>

994
00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:03.110
<v Speaker 3>so Dunkin was getting everybody in the audience use of the fact that we got 10</v>

995
00:24:03.111 --> 00:24:07.920
<v Speaker 3>foot screws backstage and they're playing a big show at the dome.</v>

996
00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:09.290
<v Speaker 3>The Dome is next to me,</v>

997
00:24:09.291 --> 00:24:12.200
<v Speaker 3>I'll know on sixth street to know point a logo.</v>

998
00:24:12.201 --> 00:24:12.830
<v Speaker 3>So people were like,</v>

999
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:13.251
<v Speaker 3>oh shit,</v>

1000
00:24:13.251 --> 00:24:14.180
<v Speaker 3>there's a concert tonight.</v>

1001
00:24:14.181 --> 00:24:15.740
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know about this 10 foot screws.</v>

1002
00:24:15.741 --> 00:24:16.550
<v Speaker 3>Are they big?</v>

1003
00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:17.900
<v Speaker 3>So then it was already there too.</v>

1004
00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.280
<v Speaker 3>Who else is already wasn't Ari was,</v>

1005
00:24:19.281 --> 00:24:21.410
<v Speaker 3>wasn't there for Dunkin was selling it like he would,</v>

1006
00:24:21.411 --> 00:24:23.000
<v Speaker 3>he was like the host and he was selling it.</v>

1007
00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.090
<v Speaker 3>We got 10 foot screws tomorrow we're going to give away some tickets.</v>

1008
00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:30.600
<v Speaker 3>So I've got a stack of half off drinks on Tuesday night.</v>

1009
00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:34.160
<v Speaker 3>I got a two stacks of them and Dunkin introduced me.</v>

1010
00:24:34.161 --> 00:24:35.120
<v Speaker 3>I was the lead singer,</v>

1011
00:24:35.121 --> 00:24:37.610
<v Speaker 3>I was the total douchebag lead singer.</v>

1012
00:24:37.611 --> 00:24:40.340
<v Speaker 3>I was like just basically playing the singer of oasis,</v>

1013
00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:41.241
<v Speaker 3>but backstage.</v>

1014
00:24:41.241 --> 00:24:42.350
<v Speaker 3>So we,</v>

1015
00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.420
<v Speaker 3>I got up on stage and said,</v>

1016
00:24:44.421 --> 00:24:46.880
<v Speaker 3>who wants these tickets to the show tomorrow?</v>

1017
00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:49.340
<v Speaker 3>Backstage they were going nuts.</v>

1018
00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.450
<v Speaker 3>So like Paul Stanley,</v>

1019
00:24:50.451 --> 00:24:54.140
<v Speaker 3>I divided the crowd to one side and I said,</v>

1020
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:56.240
<v Speaker 3>just like Paul Stanek okay this side,</v>

1021
00:24:56.241 --> 00:24:57.021
<v Speaker 3>let me hear the noise.</v>

1022
00:24:57.021 --> 00:24:58.370
<v Speaker 3>Like a one to let me hear the noise.</v>

1023
00:24:58.371 --> 00:24:59.480
<v Speaker 3>They went ahh.</v>

1024
00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:01.550
<v Speaker 3>And then I stopped him and I go this side,</v>

1025
00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:06.350
<v Speaker 3>it was just a total Paul Stanley in 1985 rebuff most bands to find that.</v>

1026
00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.420
<v Speaker 3>Finally find that and chew it up.</v>

1027
00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:09.530
<v Speaker 3>Just that part of it,</v>

1028
00:25:09.531 --> 00:25:10.364
<v Speaker 3>because when I,</v>

1029
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.650
<v Speaker 3>when I do those tickets into the audience,</v>

1030
00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:17.890
<v Speaker 3>tunes were flying headfirst over tables that we're scrambling only to find that</v>

1031
00:25:18.291 --> 00:25:19.190
<v Speaker 3>number Tuesday night,</v>

1032
00:25:19.191 --> 00:25:23.570
<v Speaker 3>half off drinks and you some crazy man wearing a wig for a band that doesn't</v>

1033
00:25:23.571 --> 00:25:24.240
<v Speaker 3>exist yet.</v>

1034
00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:24.660
<v Speaker 3>So when the,</v>

1035
00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:24.820
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1036
00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:25.030
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1037
00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:26.240
<v Speaker 3>the concert led out,</v>

1038
00:25:26.241 --> 00:25:28.010
<v Speaker 3>people had to walk by backstage.</v>

1039
00:25:28.011 --> 00:25:28.641
<v Speaker 3>It was a weird,</v>

1040
00:25:28.641 --> 00:25:29.421
<v Speaker 3>the club was set up,</v>

1041
00:25:29.421 --> 00:25:31.490
<v Speaker 3>weird word never walking out next to backstage.</v>

1042
00:25:31.491 --> 00:25:34.100
<v Speaker 3>So we had the door open and dudes are walking by gone,</v>

1043
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:35.180
<v Speaker 3>where's that bad?</v>

1044
00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.191
<v Speaker 3>So we were,</v>

1045
00:25:36.191 --> 00:25:38.370
<v Speaker 3>we grabbed one dude and we pulled in,</v>

1046
00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:41.300
<v Speaker 3>we pulled in maybe three dudes and we pulled him close the door.</v>

1047
00:25:41.301 --> 00:25:46.250
<v Speaker 3>Now they're backstage with 10 foot screws and me and Tate are just douche bags</v>

1048
00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:48.050
<v Speaker 3>were total douche bag.</v>

1049
00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.150
<v Speaker 3>You remember those fucking questions you guys,</v>

1050
00:25:50.151 --> 00:25:51.350
<v Speaker 3>now that I'm thinking about it,</v>

1051
00:25:51.351 --> 00:25:53.570
<v Speaker 3>it was a great guy who got down on his knees.</v>

1052
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.433
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1053
00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:55.521
<v Speaker 3>He wanted to.</v>

1054
00:25:55.521 --> 00:25:56.400
<v Speaker 3>He was astounded.</v>

1055
00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:57.920
<v Speaker 3>Do whatever to hang out with the pan.</v>

1056
00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:58.760
<v Speaker 3>He didn't,</v>

1057
00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.000
<v Speaker 3>he thought we were real band,</v>

1058
00:26:00.001 --> 00:26:01.640
<v Speaker 3>so we got them to do crazy shit.</v>

1059
00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.620
<v Speaker 3>He just wanted to hang out with the bed.</v>

1060
00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:03.870
<v Speaker 3>So good.</v>

1061
00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:05.030
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have to get on your knees.</v>

1062
00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:05.720
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1063
00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:06.680
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have to pray for us.</v>

1064
00:26:06.681 --> 00:26:07.490
<v Speaker 3>Pray with us.</v>

1065
00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:09.640
<v Speaker 3>I can no band sometimes parading them before they go on.</v>

1066
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:11.270
<v Speaker 3>Thank you Jesus.</v>

1067
00:26:11.271 --> 00:26:12.051
<v Speaker 3>And he would replete,</v>

1068
00:26:12.051 --> 00:26:12.884
<v Speaker 3>thank you Jesus.</v>

1069
00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:13.761
<v Speaker 3>And you said for this,</v>

1070
00:26:13.761 --> 00:26:14.160
<v Speaker 3>dig them.</v>

1071
00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:19.160
<v Speaker 3>It's a psych and then he jumped up and ran away and then Tate was,</v>

1072
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:20.690
<v Speaker 3>he's like six foot four.</v>

1073
00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.770
<v Speaker 3>He was so intimidating to the guided one.</v>

1074
00:26:22.771 --> 00:26:23.690
<v Speaker 3>I fire back,</v>

1075
00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:23.990
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1076
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:25.850
<v Speaker 3>Just Tate sitting there looking like a monster,</v>

1077
00:26:25.851 --> 00:26:26.684
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1078
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:28.040
<v Speaker 3>he was scared.</v>

1079
00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:32.150
<v Speaker 3>And then we got girls that he probably thought that you were about to try to get</v>

1080
00:26:32.151 --> 00:26:33.040
<v Speaker 3>him to suck your Dick.</v>

1081
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:34.730
<v Speaker 3>And I keep really probably thought that.</v>

1082
00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:35.121
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1083
00:26:35.121 --> 00:26:35.751
<v Speaker 3>do you think about it?</v>

1084
00:26:35.751 --> 00:26:37.660
<v Speaker 3>You're some fucking Wacko living in Colorado.</v>

1085
00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:40.970
<v Speaker 3>You know some dude who's willing to go to some green room for some band that he</v>

1086
00:26:40.971 --> 00:26:41.900
<v Speaker 3>doesn't even know,</v>

1087
00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:43.040
<v Speaker 3>never heard of before,</v>

1088
00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:43.381
<v Speaker 3>some van,</v>

1089
00:26:43.381 --> 00:26:44.214
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't even exist.</v>

1090
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:46.250
<v Speaker 2>He's on his knees praying back and forth.</v>

1091
00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:49.440
<v Speaker 2>You in his head when you said that for this dictum about the saga,</v>

1092
00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:50.281
<v Speaker 2>he probably was not,</v>

1093
00:26:50.281 --> 00:26:50.611
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1094
00:26:50.611 --> 00:26:51.570
<v Speaker 2>I fucked up.</v>

1095
00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:52.770
<v Speaker 2>I fucked up.</v>

1096
00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:53.281
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it,</v>

1097
00:26:53.281 --> 00:26:54.120
<v Speaker 2>but damn I didn't.</v>

1098
00:26:54.121 --> 00:26:54.954
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to like it.</v>

1099
00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:57.810
<v Speaker 2>And that was a great episode of too.</v>

1100
00:26:57.811 --> 00:27:02.520
<v Speaker 2>And then the other good episode was when we were on Boston number in Boston and</v>

1101
00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:03.441
<v Speaker 2>Ari Solo,</v>

1102
00:27:03.441 --> 00:27:04.320
<v Speaker 2>Ren Dunkin,</v>

1103
00:27:04.321 --> 00:27:05.490
<v Speaker 2>they both sell to the audience.</v>

1104
00:27:05.491 --> 00:27:09.930
<v Speaker 2>They open up and they said backstage where we're auditioning for the Joe Rogan</v>

1105
00:27:09.931 --> 00:27:11.100
<v Speaker 2>life stories that they're going to film.</v>

1106
00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:13.470
<v Speaker 2>And we're looking for guys to play Joe Rogan.</v>

1107
00:27:13.471 --> 00:27:15.750
<v Speaker 2>We want authentic guys from Boston.</v>

1108
00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.880
<v Speaker 2>So the guys in the audience are thinking,</v>

1109
00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:18.601
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>

1110
00:27:18.601 --> 00:27:20.940
<v Speaker 2>they're auditioning to play for play.</v>

1111
00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:21.451
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan.</v>

1112
00:27:21.451 --> 00:27:22.020
<v Speaker 2>I think I could do,</v>

1113
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.100
<v Speaker 2>you could do 100 you could do it.</v>

1114
00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:26.400
<v Speaker 2>So people lined up and we had a fake audition.</v>

1115
00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:27.480
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm this bad.</v>

1116
00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:30.360
<v Speaker 2>Probably shouldn't talk about this cause I think what you did was illegal.</v>

1117
00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:31.060
<v Speaker 2>Was it?</v>

1118
00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:31.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1119
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:32.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure he did.</v>

1120
00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:33.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

1121
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:33.871
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1122
00:27:33.871 --> 00:27:35.520
<v Speaker 2>we probably just didn't really happen.</v>

1123
00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:37.310
<v Speaker 2>We denied the yeah.</v>

1124
00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:37.531
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1125
00:27:37.531 --> 00:27:37.761
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

1126
00:27:37.761 --> 00:27:39.630
<v Speaker 2>this is all in another dimension.</v>

1127
00:27:39.631 --> 00:27:40.470
<v Speaker 2>We deny this.</v>

1128
00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:42.110
<v Speaker 2>We denied this parallel university.</v>

1129
00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:44.430
<v Speaker 2>Bravo does not seek to get suited this moment in time.</v>

1130
00:27:44.431 --> 00:27:45.480
<v Speaker 2>This is all fiction.</v>

1131
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:47.070
<v Speaker 2>Dunkin was the director.</v>

1132
00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:47.970
<v Speaker 2>Never happened.</v>

1133
00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:48.863
<v Speaker 2>It never happened.</v>

1134
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:50.550
<v Speaker 2>This didn't take place.</v>

1135
00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:54.240
<v Speaker 2>He can't timber saying hello.</v>

1136
00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:58.290
<v Speaker 2>Much respect to the Korean Zombie.</v>

1137
00:27:58.291 --> 00:28:01.920
<v Speaker 2>Any Bravo's wearing a Korean Zombie shirt and what this means for you.</v>

1138
00:28:01.921 --> 00:28:03.300
<v Speaker 2>Non MMA people.</v>

1139
00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:06.510
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy named chance on Junge who's a,</v>

1140
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:07.950
<v Speaker 2>they call them the Korean Zombie.</v>

1141
00:28:07.951 --> 00:28:08.850
<v Speaker 2>That's his nickname.</v>

1142
00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:13.560
<v Speaker 2>And this weekend on a Saturday night at the UFC against Leonard Garcia,</v>

1143
00:28:13.561 --> 00:28:17.010
<v Speaker 2>he pulled off the first twister ever in the UFC.</v>

1144
00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.530
<v Speaker 2>And the significance of course is at Eddie Bravo.</v>

1145
00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:22.800
<v Speaker 2>Our guests today actually invented the twister.</v>

1146
00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.510
<v Speaker 2>I didn't invent it.</v>

1147
00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:27.390
<v Speaker 2>Well you invented rest set up the set setup the setups.</v>

1148
00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:27.691
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1149
00:28:27.691 --> 00:28:28.441
<v Speaker 2>The finishing move.</v>

1150
00:28:28.441 --> 00:28:28.681
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1151
00:28:28.681 --> 00:28:29.790
<v Speaker 2>And you called the wrestling mode,</v>

1152
00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.620
<v Speaker 2>but people used to finish people within wrestling.</v>

1153
00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:33.511
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

1154
00:28:33.511 --> 00:28:35.970
<v Speaker 2>but did they do it your way with the escrow on the forehead?</v>

1155
00:28:35.971 --> 00:28:37.410
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was all like your,</v>

1156
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:38.220
<v Speaker 2>your uh,</v>

1157
00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.080
<v Speaker 2>innovation to turn into a submission.</v>

1158
00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:41.310
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

1159
00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:42.661
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1160
00:28:42.661 --> 00:28:42.901
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1161
00:28:42.901 --> 00:28:43.111
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1162
00:28:43.111 --> 00:28:44.010
<v Speaker 2>People were cranking,</v>

1163
00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:46.830
<v Speaker 2>cranking in exactly the way I crank it,</v>

1164
00:28:46.831 --> 00:28:48.120
<v Speaker 2>but I'm pretty sure.</v>

1165
00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:48.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1166
00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:48.961
<v Speaker 2>did you,</v>

1167
00:28:48.961 --> 00:28:52.080
<v Speaker 2>had you seen other people get submitted with it before you ever started doing</v>

1168
00:28:52.081 --> 00:28:52.914
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

1169
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:55.320
<v Speaker 2>We would like to in high school,</v>

1170
00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:59.520
<v Speaker 2>I wrestled a couple of years and then I wrestled in Santa Anna High and in ninth</v>

1171
00:28:59.521 --> 00:29:02.310
<v Speaker 2>grade a guy named Jesse Barrios and another guy,</v>

1172
00:29:02.311 --> 00:29:04.470
<v Speaker 2>his buddy is the one who showed me,</v>

1173
00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:06.180
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember his name,</v>

1174
00:29:06.181 --> 00:29:07.530
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't even remember it for my book.</v>

1175
00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:09.480
<v Speaker 2>But Jesse Barrios is his friend,</v>

1176
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:13.710
<v Speaker 2>Santa Ana high school in 1985 if anybody out there is from that,</v>

1177
00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.570
<v Speaker 2>there's Jesse Barrios friend,</v>

1178
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:17.910
<v Speaker 2>the other leg rider on that wrestling team.</v>

1179
00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:18.511
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>

1180
00:29:18.511 --> 00:29:19.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what his name is.</v>

1181
00:29:19.411 --> 00:29:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

1182
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.190
<v Speaker 2>he showed it to me and both of those and in wrestling,</v>

1183
00:29:23.191 --> 00:29:28.191
<v Speaker 2>leg riding is for weak people and all that means is as we need,</v>

1184
00:29:28.711 --> 00:29:29.340
<v Speaker 2>we're so weak.</v>

1185
00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:34.340
<v Speaker 2>We need to use our legs a lot more than the big strong dudes who are wrestling</v>

1186
00:29:34.441 --> 00:29:34.581
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1187
00:29:34.581 --> 00:29:34.741
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1188
00:29:34.741 --> 00:29:37.380
<v Speaker 2>and hitting the weights and had big chest and shoulders.</v>

1189
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:41.010
<v Speaker 2>Those guys really didn't rely on their legs as much as the weak guys like me.</v>

1190
00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:41.950
<v Speaker 2>I would skip Russ,</v>

1191
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:42.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1192
00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:44.410
<v Speaker 3>weightlifting a practice.</v>

1193
00:29:44.411 --> 00:29:46.150
<v Speaker 3>I was in the back where I was hiding.</v>

1194
00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:47.110
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

1195
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.890
<v Speaker 3>I was weak.</v>

1196
00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:49.060
<v Speaker 3>Even back then.</v>

1197
00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:50.620
<v Speaker 3>I was a terrible athlete.</v>

1198
00:29:50.621 --> 00:29:52.000
<v Speaker 3>I've never been a great athlete.</v>

1199
00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:54.130
<v Speaker 3>So I had to rely on using my legs.</v>

1200
00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:56.290
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>

1201
00:29:56.291 --> 00:29:56.521
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1202
00:29:56.521 --> 00:29:57.354
<v Speaker 3>they came to me,</v>

1203
00:29:57.450 --> 00:29:58.660
<v Speaker 3>Jesse came to me and I go,</v>

1204
00:29:58.661 --> 00:29:58.901
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1205
00:29:58.901 --> 00:30:00.010
<v Speaker 3>you'll be perfect for this.</v>

1206
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:01.120
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1207
00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.350
<v Speaker 3>cause they knew I just get out,</v>

1208
00:30:02.351 --> 00:30:05.080
<v Speaker 3>just get smashed if I try to go heads up with people.</v>

1209
00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:10.290
<v Speaker 3>So it's a pending move in that I learned in wrestling and um,</v>

1210
00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:11.951
<v Speaker 3>I got,</v>

1211
00:30:11.951 --> 00:30:12.940
<v Speaker 3>I got pretty good at it.</v>

1212
00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:13.480
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

1213
00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.310
<v Speaker 3>that was my shit even in high school.</v>

1214
00:30:15.311 --> 00:30:15.701
<v Speaker 3>That was my,</v>

1215
00:30:15.701 --> 00:30:17.140
<v Speaker 3>that was the thing I always tried.</v>

1216
00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:20.380
<v Speaker 3>I got some cool ass stories that maybe one day I'll,</v>

1217
00:30:20.381 --> 00:30:20.651
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

1218
00:30:20.651 --> 00:30:21.484
<v Speaker 3>I'll uh,</v>

1219
00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:22.541
<v Speaker 3>I'll talk about him,</v>

1220
00:30:22.541 --> 00:30:23.980
<v Speaker 3>but I have some cool wrestling stories.</v>

1221
00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:24.401
<v Speaker 3>But anyways,</v>

1222
00:30:24.401 --> 00:30:25.420
<v Speaker 3>I sucked at wrestling.</v>

1223
00:30:25.421 --> 00:30:27.700
<v Speaker 3>I only had one take down two fucking years.</v>

1224
00:30:27.701 --> 00:30:28.534
<v Speaker 3>I sucked.</v>

1225
00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.170
<v Speaker 3>So I just totally relied on leg riding and,</v>

1226
00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:33.131
<v Speaker 3>and using the,</v>

1227
00:30:33.131 --> 00:30:34.480
<v Speaker 3>it's actually called the guillotine.</v>

1228
00:30:34.481 --> 00:30:36.040
<v Speaker 3>It's actually not called the twister,</v>

1229
00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:37.330
<v Speaker 3>it's called the guillotine.</v>

1230
00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:42.130
<v Speaker 3>But when I started doing an end Jujitsu Higgin Machado and John John Machado</v>

1231
00:30:42.131 --> 00:30:44.830
<v Speaker 3>would just call it the twister because the guillotine already existed.</v>

1232
00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.350
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people out there that,</v>

1233
00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:50.980
<v Speaker 3>that think that I'd like took this wrestling move and I said,</v>

1234
00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:55.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to try to fool the world and change the name and say I invented it.</v>

1235
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:59.260
<v Speaker 3>There's thousands of people that think that it's hilarious.</v>

1236
00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:01.120
<v Speaker 3>In my books from day one,</v>

1237
00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:02.200
<v Speaker 3>I I,</v>

1238
00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:03.780
<v Speaker 1>it was to hold on a second.</v>

1239
00:31:03.781 --> 00:31:06.910
<v Speaker 1>You're being a little bit modest because you invented all these setups and</v>

1240
00:31:06.911 --> 00:31:09.400
<v Speaker 1>turned it into a very high percentage finish.</v>

1241
00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1242
00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:13.720
<v Speaker 1>Answered a lot of setups from a lot of different places where it became,</v>

1243
00:31:13.721 --> 00:31:13.871
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1244
00:31:13.871 --> 00:31:14.060
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

1245
00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:15.280
<v Speaker 1>Then none of that stuff existed,</v>

1246
00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:17.080
<v Speaker 1>but this is the transition.</v>

1247
00:31:17.081 --> 00:31:18.370
<v Speaker 1>So I ended up</v>

1248
00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.320
<v Speaker 3>quitting wrestling.</v>

1249
00:31:19.321 --> 00:31:19.771
<v Speaker 3>The work,</v>

1250
00:31:19.771 --> 00:31:20.604
<v Speaker 3>the work,</v>

1251
00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:21.750
<v Speaker 3>the work will,</v>

1252
00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:22.501
<v Speaker 3>the work ethic.</v>

1253
00:31:22.501 --> 00:31:25.410
<v Speaker 3>You need to be a good wrestler or something that is just not in my body.</v>

1254
00:31:25.411 --> 00:31:26.244
<v Speaker 3>Chemistry,</v>

1255
00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.640
<v Speaker 3>I was not made to work really hard physically I,</v>

1256
00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:29.790
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1257
00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:30.930
<v Speaker 3>I hated work.</v>

1258
00:31:30.931 --> 00:31:31.830
<v Speaker 3>Regular jobs.</v>

1259
00:31:31.831 --> 00:31:34.980
<v Speaker 3>I knew that's why it was all about rock stardom or,</v>

1260
00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:36.720
<v Speaker 3>or playing football.</v>

1261
00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:37.180
<v Speaker 3>It was a,</v>

1262
00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:42.180
<v Speaker 3>I just want her to be like a famous dude who just played for a living and got</v>

1263
00:31:42.541 --> 00:31:44.670
<v Speaker 3>paid and was a fucking adored by everybody.</v>

1264
00:31:44.671 --> 00:31:45.570
<v Speaker 3>That's what I wanted.</v>

1265
00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:47.310
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to work.</v>

1266
00:31:47.311 --> 00:31:48.061
<v Speaker 3>I hate it.</v>

1267
00:31:48.061 --> 00:31:48.960
<v Speaker 3>Or of course,</v>

1268
00:31:48.961 --> 00:31:49.800
<v Speaker 3>who doesn't want,</v>

1269
00:31:49.801 --> 00:31:53.250
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God would work like actually like killed me inside.</v>

1270
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:56.180
<v Speaker 3>So it drove my artistic side.</v>

1271
00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:06.330
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
