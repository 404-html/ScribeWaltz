00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Freak bitches,</v>

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:04.570
<v Speaker 1>sort of like what you were talking about,</v>

3
00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:07.510
<v Speaker 1>this people that have this simplistic idea that all you have to do is get Donald</v>

4
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.250
<v Speaker 1>Trump high on dmt and he's gonna see the light.</v>

5
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.160
<v Speaker 1>That's not necessarily the case.</v>

6
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.670
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily the case.</v>

7
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.530
<v Speaker 1>I think it would be wasted on him.</v>

8
00:00:14.531 --> 00:00:16.480
<v Speaker 1>I think we would have to do at least</v>

9
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.660
<v Speaker 2>at least an indwelling catheter may be two or three hours of continuous dmt.</v>

10
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.243
<v Speaker 2>Fusion.</v>

11
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.293
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

12
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:29.270
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>

13
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:29.990
<v Speaker 2>wrong term.</v>

14
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.640
<v Speaker 2>Why intravenous,</v>

15
00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:32.580
<v Speaker 2>but it's very,</v>

16
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.740
<v Speaker 2>very freudian decided to go through his dick.</v>

17
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.360
<v Speaker 2>That is hilarious.</v>

18
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.573
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

19
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.480
<v Speaker 2>we'll.</v>

20
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.630
<v Speaker 2>We'll go through the vein.</v>

21
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.980
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

22
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:43.281
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

23
00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:44.990
<v Speaker 2>I think he might have nailed it the first time.</v>

24
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.840
<v Speaker 2>Might be the way to get it.</v>

25
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.940
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the way to get it to them in some perfect Russian robot fuck doll who just</v>

26
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.040
<v Speaker 2>locks them up and you know.</v>

27
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.090
<v Speaker 2>Right when he gets inside.</v>

28
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.483
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

29
00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.820
<v Speaker 2>She gets them in full guard.</v>

30
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.780
<v Speaker 2>Locks in place and catheter delivery.</v>

31
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.453
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

32
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:05.541
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:05.541 --> 00:01:06.810
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they can program it like,</v>

34
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.150
<v Speaker 2>like Dmt,</v>

35
00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:11.090
<v Speaker 2>like little nanobots that go right through the hole,</v>

36
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.390
<v Speaker 2>right through the penis hole right into the system.</v>

37
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.580
<v Speaker 2>They just run out of her right in there and he's,</v>

38
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.310
<v Speaker 2>he just takes off.</v>

39
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.420
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

40
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.160
<v Speaker 2>there has to be something there.</v>

41
00:01:22.161 --> 00:01:23.940
<v Speaker 2>Somebody animated that have an effect.</v>

42
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:24.370
<v Speaker 2>Please.</v>

43
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.203
<v Speaker 2>So many anime.</v>

44
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.060
<v Speaker 2>I know there's somebody out there that wants to do it.</v>

45
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.280
<v Speaker 1>The Internet is sort of exposed all this stuff.</v>

46
00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:34.170
<v Speaker 1>So that was the end of it.</v>

47
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:35.661
<v Speaker 1>That literal use,</v>

48
00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:36.470
<v Speaker 1>the end design and tall.</v>

49
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.120
<v Speaker 1>And how much has it dropped off since then?</v>

50
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.531
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

51
00:01:39.531 --> 00:01:43.670
<v Speaker 1>it's been estimated by people who would know that there's maybe 20,000</v>

52
00:01:43.671 --> 00:01:44.840
<v Speaker 1>scientologists right now.</v>

53
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.100
<v Speaker 1>What was it at its peak?</v>

54
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.950
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in the early nineties.</v>

55
00:01:47.951 --> 00:01:48.980
<v Speaker 1>You bought 100,000.</v>

56
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.730
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

57
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:50.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

58
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.330
<v Speaker 1>20,000.</v>

59
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.513
<v Speaker 1>That's like a,</v>

60
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.680
<v Speaker 1>a good Louis ck concert.</v>

61
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

62
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.223
<v Speaker 1>the thing is</v>

63
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.890
<v Speaker 1>most people I get that international base are people who have been around for</v>

64
00:02:03.891 --> 00:02:04.401
<v Speaker 1>25,</v>

65
00:02:04.401 --> 00:02:04.701
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>

66
00:02:04.701 --> 00:02:05.181
<v Speaker 1>35,</v>

67
00:02:05.181 --> 00:02:06.014
<v Speaker 1>40 years.</v>

68
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.483
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

69
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:08.301
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

70
00:02:08.301 --> 00:02:09.380
<v Speaker 1>how could you live this way?</v>

71
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.491
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

72
00:02:10.491 --> 00:02:12.020
<v Speaker 1>most people are not going to do what I do.</v>

73
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.020
<v Speaker 1>I was 76 one 76 years old when I left.</v>

74
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

75
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.930
<v Speaker 1>And you were 75 when they give you 75 gifts.</v>

76
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.450
<v Speaker 1>So you like this?</v>

77
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.941
<v Speaker 1>Not Enough.</v>

78
00:02:19.941 --> 00:02:20.990
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get the fuck out of here.</v>

79
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.070
<v Speaker 1>I need.</v>

80
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.903
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

81
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.310
<v Speaker 1>you mean not enough gifts to get in 76.</v>

82
00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:25.521
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

83
00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:26.354
<v Speaker 1>You got.</v>

84
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.020
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

85
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.853
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

86
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.021
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

87
00:02:30.021 --> 00:02:33.000
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you something that happened and I brought this just to show you and</v>

88
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.890
<v Speaker 1>have a little.</v>

89
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:34.670
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

90
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.360
<v Speaker 1>Kindle.</v>

91
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.193
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

92
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Are you allowed to have those in there?</v>

93
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.343
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

94
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.333
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

95
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.380
<v Speaker 1>You can't have a kindle and I didn't know why.</v>

96
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.510
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know why.</v>

97
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.820
<v Speaker 1>What happened is this.</v>

98
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.290
<v Speaker 1>David gave me this Kendall</v>

99
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.760
<v Speaker 1>and the security guards were doing.</v>

100
00:02:52.761 --> 00:02:54.620
<v Speaker 1>They're not trying to get it away from me,</v>

101
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.800
<v Speaker 1>but they wouldn't come in strong army because David is the man.</v>

102
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.400
<v Speaker 1>So David gave it to you in the security guards are trying to take it away from</v>

103
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:03.640
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

104
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.473
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

105
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.321
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

106
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>

107
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.491
<v Speaker 1>Did you tell them?</v>

108
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:09.630
<v Speaker 1>It was loaded up with l Ron Hubbard books where it was.</v>

109
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 1>It was his fiction books that he put in your field earth?</v>

110
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:14.141
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

111
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:15.730
<v Speaker 1>not battlefield or northern machinery,</v>

112
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.290
<v Speaker 1>but the other earlier fiction,</v>

113
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.170
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was pretty interesting,</v>

114
00:03:20.171 --> 00:03:21.004
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>

115
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.420
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to get the says,</v>

116
00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:22.571
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

117
00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:23.410
<v Speaker 1>fuck you man.</v>

118
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.041
<v Speaker 1>They gave me,</v>

119
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 1>this is mine,</v>

120
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:25.400
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

121
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

122
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.841
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

123
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 1>Ron Did back off.</v>

124
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.910
<v Speaker 1>Now one day I'm reading something and there's a feature on here where you see</v>

125
00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:35.850
<v Speaker 1>this is the camera on that now?</v>

126
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:36.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

127
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.293
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

128
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.170
<v Speaker 1>You see this little</v>

129
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.030
<v Speaker 1>switch here that goes this way,</v>

130
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.440
<v Speaker 1>this way up.</v>

131
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.030
<v Speaker 1>Down and in.</v>

132
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.460
<v Speaker 1>So if you got a word that you'd like to look up and get the meaning of,</v>

133
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.190
<v Speaker 1>you'd go to the library or not.</v>

134
00:03:54.191 --> 00:03:54.641
<v Speaker 1>The library.</v>

135
00:03:54.641 --> 00:03:55.474
<v Speaker 1>The dictionary,</v>

136
00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.990
<v Speaker 1>and you'd select the award and pressure to the right and it would say search</v>

137
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.043
<v Speaker 1>store.</v>

138
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.480
<v Speaker 1>I accidentally held it a little bit too long and it went right past search store</v>

139
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.033
<v Speaker 1>to google.</v>

140
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.700
<v Speaker 1>I was on the Internet with</v>

141
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.533
<v Speaker 2>no filter.</v>

142
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.780
<v Speaker 2>It is a crazy little machines.</v>

143
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.871
<v Speaker 2>It's a big ass,</v>

144
00:04:14.871 --> 00:04:15.810
<v Speaker 2>but you're not buying that shit.</v>

145
00:04:15.811 --> 00:04:16.820
<v Speaker 2>Eddie nearly killed.</v>

146
00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:18.740
<v Speaker 2>It looks like an explosion.</v>

147
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.600
<v Speaker 2>It's an a bomb</v>

148
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.183
<v Speaker 2>bomb.</v>

149
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.980

152
00:04:30.711 --> 00:04:31.544

158
00:04:43.971 --> 00:04:45.320
<v Speaker 2>Why are they showing us this?</v>

159
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.491
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm thinking.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Everybody's rooting for the triceratops.</v>

176
00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.400
<v Speaker 2>If you ruined for the tyrannosaurus rex in that epic battle Douche bag.</v>

177
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.820
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

178
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:22.211

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.390
<v Speaker 2>I would say a yes.</v>

186
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.720

<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

193
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.513
<v Speaker 2>That's my guess.</v>

194
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.940
<v Speaker 2>It looks exactly the same.</v>

195
00:05:46.941 --> 00:05:48.620
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of tail hops around on two legs.</v>

238
00:06:53.871 --> 00:06:57.350
<v Speaker 2>I just remember him being on o'reilly and watching it and going,</v>

<v Speaker 2>what is like that longing for in the Stall Gia thing?</v>

00:07:03.501 --> 00:07:04.520
<v Speaker 2>well that's the way it is.</v>

243
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.810
<v Speaker 2>The tide goes in,</v>

244
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.471
<v Speaker 2>tide goes out.</v>

245
00:07:06.471 --> 00:07:07.304
<v Speaker 2>Can you explain it?</v>

246
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:07.640
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

248
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:10.940
<v Speaker 2>That was when he was talking.</v>

249
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.890
<v Speaker 2>He was talking to an atheist resume.</v>

250
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:13.371
<v Speaker 2>Who was he?</v>

251
00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:13.760
<v Speaker 2>Was it?</v>

00:07:13.971 --> 00:07:15.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember who was like,</v>

254
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.230
<v Speaker 2>maybe it was ricky Gervais' or some.</v>

255
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:17.841
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember,</v>

256
00:07:17.841 --> 00:07:18.674
<v Speaker 2>but he was saying,</v>

<v Speaker 2>well maybe it was sam.</v>

258
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:22.003
<v Speaker 2>Could it have been saying?</v>

259
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:24.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who it was.</v>

260
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.200
<v Speaker 2>Someone was saying like I was saying what he was like.</v>

261
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:29.563
<v Speaker 2>Bill was like,</v>

262
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.720
<v Speaker 2>I've got the absolute number one reason why you have to believe in God because</v>

263
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:37.453
<v Speaker 2>tide goes in.</v>

264
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.293
<v Speaker 2>Tide goes out.</v>

265
00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.173
<v Speaker 2>Always been that way.</v>

266
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.840
<v Speaker 2>Always will be that way goes round or it spins around.</v>

267
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:42.711
<v Speaker 2>How do you explain that?</v>

268
00:07:42.711 --> 00:07:43.041
<v Speaker 2>If not,</v>

269
00:07:43.041 --> 00:07:43.490
<v Speaker 2>God?</v>

270
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.390
<v Speaker 2>It was just super obvious that he was pandering because the guy went to fucking</v>

271
00:07:47.391 --> 00:07:47.841
<v Speaker 2>Harvard.</v>

272
00:07:47.841 --> 00:07:48.171
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

273
00:07:48.171 --> 00:07:49.370
<v Speaker 2>Bill O'reilly's not a dope.</v>

274
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.540
<v Speaker 2>He might be a Douche bag,</v>

275
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.710
<v Speaker 2>but he's not a dope.</v>

276
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:52.680
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

277
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.930
<v Speaker 2>I think religion makes people dopey and they'd done that don't even know about.</v>

278
00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think he's religious.</v>

279
00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:59.960
<v Speaker 2>I think he's barely religious.</v>

280
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:02.450
<v Speaker 2>I think he's religious enough to get by with the job.</v>

281
00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.970
<v Speaker 2>I think he's innocent.</v>

282
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.510
<v Speaker 2>He has been in some 100 percent because I think he's one of the.</v>

283
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.171
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

284
00:08:09.171 --> 00:08:10.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't watch the show a lot,</v>

285
00:08:10.131 --> 00:08:10.761
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not sure,</v>

286
00:08:10.761 --> 00:08:11.030
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

287
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:13.340
<v Speaker 2>he's always struck me as one of the more straight shooters.</v>

288
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:14.383
<v Speaker 2>I think he is.</v>

289
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:16.520
<v Speaker 2>He's smart,</v>

290
00:08:16.521 --> 00:08:17.510
<v Speaker 2>but not wise.</v>

291
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:18.380
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

292
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:18.800
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

293
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.041
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

294
00:08:19.041 --> 00:08:22.730
<v Speaker 2>he feels what he feels in his gut is more important than what the data tells</v>

295
00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:23.380
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

296
00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.290
<v Speaker 2>And I think he falls for a bunch of fallacies that a lot of people fall for,</v>

297
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:27.950
<v Speaker 2>especially if they're religious,</v>

298
00:08:27.951 --> 00:08:32.510
<v Speaker 2>like the idea that there was a certain order to the cosmos and how could we all</v>

299
00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:33.300
<v Speaker 2>have come about?</v>

300
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:36.320
<v Speaker 2>How could this whole thing around us exist with all these butterflies and the</v>

301
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:39.560

<v Speaker 2>these spiritual creatures,</v>

304
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.610
<v Speaker 2>these beings sitting opposite each other on a,</v>

305
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.890
<v Speaker 2>at a table in Los Angeles right now.</v>

306
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.960
<v Speaker 2>Some people just find that to inexplicably to explain without a diety,</v>

307
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:51.621
<v Speaker 2>so they're like,</v>

308
00:08:51.621 --> 00:08:51.901
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

309
00:08:51.901 --> 00:08:53.270
<v Speaker 2>there must have been a big guy who did it.</v>
