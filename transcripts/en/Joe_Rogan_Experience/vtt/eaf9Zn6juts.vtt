31
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.870

<v Speaker 2>I don't do the store that much anymore</v>

32
00:01:14.871 --> 00:01:18.650
<v Speaker 2>because I've stopped doing showcase</v>
<v Speaker 2>spots for the most part.</v>

33
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.350
<v Speaker 2>I just do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a regular show every Friday night</v>

<v Speaker 2>at the Improv in the lab and I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

35
00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:26.540
<v Speaker 2>an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hour and 10 minutes.</v>

36
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.700
<v Speaker 2>And then occasionally I do flappers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a horrible name yet in Burbank,</v>

37
00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:34.850
<v Speaker 2>but they'll look club but a great room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A great room.</v>

38
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I do there on occasion on Sunday</v>

39
00:01:37.611 --> 00:01:40.220
<v Speaker 2>nights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I do an hour,</v>

40
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going out of the House for 15,</v>

41
00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:45.050
<v Speaker 2>20 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Worth my time.</v>

42
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.520
<v Speaker 2>Does it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

43
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.620
<v Speaker 2>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you do like an hour set,</v>

44
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.120
<v Speaker 2>do you plan your sets out or do you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some material that you'd like to be</v>

45
00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:53.660
<v Speaker 2>working on in?</v>

46
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.210
<v Speaker 2>Is that why you like the freedom of</v>
<v Speaker 2>having an hour or so you could just kind</v>

47
00:01:56.211 --> 00:01:58.970
<v Speaker 2>of fuck around?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no preparation whatsoever,</v>

48
00:01:58.971 --> 00:02:00.050
<v Speaker 2>except I may think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

49
00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:03.410
<v Speaker 2>I'll talk about that tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have no preparation.</v>

50
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.440
<v Speaker 2>It may bring up a story I've told</v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

51
00:02:06.441 --> 00:02:09.500
<v Speaker 2>but I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally when I step on stage,</v>

52
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.810
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea what I'm going to talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

53
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.530
<v Speaker 2>what does help me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I've done for quite a while now as</v>

54
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.600
<v Speaker 2>I come up to a different song every time</v>
<v Speaker 2>I come up and then I just talk about</v>

55
00:02:20.601 --> 00:02:23.120
<v Speaker 2>that song,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the story of the making of that song,</v>

56
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.690
<v Speaker 2>who sang that song,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what that song means to me and that will</v>

57
00:02:26.691 --> 00:02:29.570
<v Speaker 2>usually lead me to something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all I need.</v>

58
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason why I asked is you have a</v>

59
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.980
<v Speaker 2>very unusual style,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I've seen you a bunch of times at</v>

60
00:02:33.981 --> 00:02:35.780
<v Speaker 2>the store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very loose,</v>

61
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.150
<v Speaker 2>very loose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great thing because you have the</v>

62
00:02:38.151 --> 00:02:40.940
<v Speaker 2>confidence to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of people have to be like</v>

63
00:02:40.941 --> 00:02:43.540
<v Speaker 2>super rigid and their preparation</v>
<v Speaker 2>without a doubt.</v>

64
00:02:43.541 --> 00:02:44.374
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same thing.</v>

65
00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.360
<v Speaker 2>Set up punchline in the correct order</v>
<v Speaker 2>every night.</v>

66
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm only confident in the fact that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>funny.</v>

67
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.650
<v Speaker 2>I am not competent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And any other fact in terms of going on</v>

68
00:02:53.651 --> 00:02:56.510
<v Speaker 2>stage that's going to support it is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most important.</v>

69
00:02:56.511 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 2>And so I go up with the knowledge that</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter goes down.</v>

70
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 3>I am funny and we'll be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

71
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.930
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Goodnight.</v>

72
00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Speaker 3>And Are you doing the road at all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hardly ever.</v>

73
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 3>When I do the road it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did London in December,</v>

74
00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:16.360
<v Speaker 3>that a couple of weeks of shows a week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple of weeks at a theater there.</v>

75
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.450
<v Speaker 3>What they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

76
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.480
<v Speaker 3>theater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a small cool theater.</v>

77
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.240
<v Speaker 3>That's like 500 seats or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know.</v>

78
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't even pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How's that?</v>

79
00:03:23.971 --> 00:03:25.690
<v Speaker 3>I've done that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

83
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.570
<v Speaker 3>I got to London,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to New York on occasion and</v>

84
00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:36.360
<v Speaker 3>perform.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use,</v>

85
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.720
<v Speaker 3>I played everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I played everywhere from Indianapolis to</v>

86
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:44.410
<v Speaker 3>Seattle to Miami,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an all points in between,</v>

87
00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

88
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.100
<v Speaker 3>Tucson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

89
00:03:48.101 --> 00:03:49.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Phoenix,</v>

90
00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all over.</v>

91
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:51.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done it.</v>

92
00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm 56 years old.</v>

93
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.190
<v Speaker 3>I've got two TV shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I develop a bunch of other stuff.</v>

94
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm passionate about my stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get enough,</v>

95
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they earn a living by</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on the road,</v>

96
00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:07.831
<v Speaker 3>which I have had to in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I stay home and do my standup when I</v>

97
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:11.230
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is every Friday for sure.</v>

98
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.230
<v Speaker 3>Because the thing is it's a very nice</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've worked towards that and that's</v>

99
00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:17.260
<v Speaker 3>a beautiful thing to work towards</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the thing that does get you is</v>

100
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:22.261
<v Speaker 3>that travel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh you know it was the thing that no one</v>

101
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:27.781
<v Speaker 3>understands is the only joy that you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly get when you travel is the</v>

102
00:04:28.271 --> 00:04:32.800
<v Speaker 3>moment when you're on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if that's troublesome or not fun,</v>

103
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.410
<v Speaker 3>it's a drag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's depressing.</v>

104
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.980
<v Speaker 3>But those moments on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're great,</v>

105
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.330
<v Speaker 3>it's all worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

106
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.300
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the thing that also when you go on</v>

107
00:04:43.301 --> 00:04:45.760
<v Speaker 3>the road,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have to do morning radio,</v>

108
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.040
<v Speaker 3>that's your health.</v>

109
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.910
<v Speaker 3>It screws up your time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what time you go to bed.</v>

110
00:04:51.911 --> 00:04:53.530
<v Speaker 3>Cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to set,</v>

111
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't worry as much on a consistent</v>
<v Speaker 3>basis what time I wake up cause that'll</v>

112
00:04:58.301 --> 00:05:02.680
<v Speaker 3>automatic b automatic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried consistently to go to bed at the</v>

113
00:05:02.681 --> 00:05:07.681
<v Speaker 3>same time every night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a different approach that a</v>

114
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.530
<v Speaker 3>psychiatrist told me and it has worked</v>
<v Speaker 3>wonders for me.</v>

115
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.980
<v Speaker 3>A psychiatrist told you yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's bad because everyone always</v>

116
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:17.860
<v Speaker 3>focuses on waking up the same time every</v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

117
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.370
<v Speaker 3>He said focus on going to bed at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same time every night and that'll be</v>

118
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.540
<v Speaker 3>more productive for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I do that with a sort of a half hour</v>

119
00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:31.270
<v Speaker 3>bump to fall asleep to maybe read for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>minute,</v>

120
00:05:31.271 --> 00:05:35.170
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm in bed usually by 10 I've never</v>

121
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:36.980
<v Speaker 3>gone to a psychiatrist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a one,</v>

122
00:05:36.981 --> 00:05:41.890
<v Speaker 3>one of the shows that it was on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like the only person on the set</v>

123
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.690
<v Speaker 3>that didn't go to a psychiatrist.</v>

124
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.070
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'm fucked up.</v>

125
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.870
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

126
00:05:46.871 --> 00:05:49.990
<v Speaker 3>if you're functioning in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>

127
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.080
<v Speaker 3>Congratulations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have sometimes trouble functioning in</v>

128
00:05:55.481 --> 00:05:56.380
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How's,</v>

129
00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:56.900
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

130
00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.160
<v Speaker 3>and a well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like I find going on stage,</v>

131
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm fearless and I don't even like</v>
<v Speaker 3>leaving my house.</v>

132
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.990
<v Speaker 3>I prefer to stay home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love napping.</v>

133
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.530
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do I love napping?</v>

134
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.670
<v Speaker 3>If I could smoke some endeca and take a</v>
<v Speaker 3>nap every day.</v>

135
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:19.150
<v Speaker 3>I do transcendental meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do all the chill things at home and I</v>

136
00:06:19.371 --> 00:06:22.160
<v Speaker 3>leave to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like going to parties.</v>

137
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.540
<v Speaker 3>I like a good dinner party because that</v>
<v Speaker 3>means I can have an actual conversation</v>

138
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:29.300
<v Speaker 3>with someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I was just at a party the other</v>

139
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.920
<v Speaker 3>night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a goodbye party for a friend of mine.</v>

140
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.690
<v Speaker 3>It was a Jeff Ross House and I had the</v>
<v Speaker 3>worst time.</v>

141
00:06:35.691 --> 00:06:38.450
<v Speaker 3>I lasted 20 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only people I could talk to where</v>

142
00:06:38.451 --> 00:06:42.060
<v Speaker 3>Comedians I there were looking to be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeff Ross,</v>

143
00:06:42.061 --> 00:06:43.190
<v Speaker 3>his party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but comedian,</v>

144
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.470
<v Speaker 3>some people with man buns in the hot</v>
<v Speaker 3>tub.</v>

145
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:50.040
<v Speaker 3>It was very unsettling and wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted nothing to do with it.</v>

146
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.550
<v Speaker 3>I said my goodbyes to my friend and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

147
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.860
<v Speaker 3>she's moving to Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I um,</v>

148
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.020
<v Speaker 3>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>said my goodbyes,</v>

149
00:07:00.021 --> 00:07:02.060
<v Speaker 3>but I was out of respect to her that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>went,</v>

150
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:06.070
<v Speaker 3>but out of respect to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't stay long man buns in a hot tub</v>

151
00:07:06.071 --> 00:07:08.150
<v Speaker 3>because we never see combination in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>hot tub.</v>

152
00:07:08.151 --> 00:07:09.710
<v Speaker 3>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't belong here.</v>

153
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:12.620
<v Speaker 3>You don't belong there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

154
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.910
<v Speaker 3>I can't be done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

155
00:07:13.911 --> 00:07:15.770
<v Speaker 3>it's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When did that start happening?</v>

156
00:07:15.771 --> 00:07:20.160
<v Speaker 3>When did the man bun stones to me like</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a big way a couple of years ago and</v>

157
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:24.850
<v Speaker 3>was like Samurais and then there was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>big dropoff for a long time and then a</v>

158
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:28.070
<v Speaker 3>big drop off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly it.</v>

159
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe why grow your hair long if you're</v>

160
00:07:31.731 --> 00:07:32.750
<v Speaker 3>going to wear a man bun?</v>

161
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.890
<v Speaker 3>I think either lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have the idea,</v>

162
00:07:35.891 --> 00:07:40.010
<v Speaker 3>but it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was at a gas station in studio city</v>

163
00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:43.700
<v Speaker 3>and I was seconds away from talking to</v>
<v Speaker 3>this dude.</v>

164
00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:49.060
<v Speaker 3>He had a man bond that looked like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bird's nest with Kaitlyn with a</v>

165
00:07:49.611 --> 00:07:52.160
<v Speaker 3>waterfall on the outside and I just</v>
<v Speaker 3>went,</v>

166
00:07:52.161 --> 00:07:53.890
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to pass him.</v>

167
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:58.040
<v Speaker 3>I go on being totally friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to make this a conversation.</v>

168
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.410
<v Speaker 3>Why explain?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't get it.</v>

169
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.800
<v Speaker 3>I feel like what it is is it's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

170
00:08:02.801 --> 00:08:05.450
<v Speaker 3>they're letting you know that this is me</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I'm out,</v>

171
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.370
<v Speaker 3>but when I'm at home and I'm feeling</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexy,</v>

172
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:11.090
<v Speaker 3>I just undo that and let it down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it is.</v>

173
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:14.100
<v Speaker 3>I just relax and I unwrapped the big</v>
<v Speaker 3>ball,</v>

174
00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:15.950
<v Speaker 3>the wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a big bouldering and no,</v>

175
00:08:15.951 --> 00:08:18.080
<v Speaker 3>you're not sexy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Douchey,</v>

176
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:22.370
<v Speaker 3>douchey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just what's your hair's ever been mine.</v>

177
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.700
<v Speaker 3>I had like a Jew fro type festival</v>
<v Speaker 3>happening when I was younger.</v>

178
00:08:25.701 --> 00:08:28.100
<v Speaker 3>Like longer curly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not like shoulder length.</v>

179
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.010
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's ridiculous.</v>

180
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:34.820
<v Speaker 3>It's weird that hair grows that long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Only on your head.</v>

181
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:39.410
<v Speaker 3>That's what's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rocker arm and you're grown like Robert</v>

182
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:40.830
<v Speaker 3>Plant's had cool hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

183
00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:42.740
<v Speaker 3>go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't man bun it.</v>

184
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:43.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go for it.</v>

185
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm all for long hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rockers of different rules.</v>

186
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:48.950
<v Speaker 3>I saw a guy last night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bay in a band,</v>

187
00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.350
<v Speaker 3>a bass player,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a big man bun.</v>

188
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.400
<v Speaker 3>Big baller wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

189
00:08:52.401 --> 00:08:55.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm uncomfortable with a cel haircut in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a rock band.</v>

190
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing with that fucking</v>

191
00:08:58.051 --> 00:09:01.320
<v Speaker 2>button down conservative haircut?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dig the play in a band.</v>

192
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.650
<v Speaker 2>I think playing against type is a big</v>
<v Speaker 2>bullet.</v>

193
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.160
<v Speaker 2>Delightful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

194
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.760
<v Speaker 2>not Angela.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We differ on this one.</v>

195
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.980
<v Speaker 2>We differ on this one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes we did.</v>

196
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:14.790
<v Speaker 2>I think a group of men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I thought David Bowie's band,</v>

197
00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:16.860
<v Speaker 2>tin machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really dig their music,</v>

198
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.790
<v Speaker 2>but I love the look of all of them</v>
<v Speaker 2>wearing the suits with the close cropped</v>

199
00:09:20.791 --> 00:09:25.050
<v Speaker 2>hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well Bowie's so odd and so undeniably</v>

200
00:09:25.051 --> 00:09:27.780
<v Speaker 2>creative that he was allowed to get away</v>
<v Speaker 2>with anything and he's allowed to do</v>

201
00:09:27.781 --> 00:09:28.680
<v Speaker 2>anything he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

202
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:33.270
<v Speaker 2>but truthfully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have any sort of a confidence you</v>

203
00:09:33.271 --> 00:09:36.110
<v Speaker 2>can except the man bun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There it is right here.</v>

204
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.310
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>History of Bowie's.</v>

205
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:39.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that there should have cut his hair</v>

206
00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:42.480
<v Speaker 2>short.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one with the long hair maybe,</v>

207
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.780
<v Speaker 2>but he's Kinda John Travolta and he cut</v>
<v Speaker 2>it short.</v>

208
00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:49.890
<v Speaker 2>Here is the pressure from the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>three guys got to be too much at tired</v>

209
00:09:49.891 --> 00:09:52.150
<v Speaker 2>of buying shampoo and all that bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

210
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.310
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

211
00:09:53.311 --> 00:09:55.650
<v Speaker 2>The upkeep is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Outrageous.</v>

212
00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.530
<v Speaker 2>Do to condition their hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they have to leave it in for 10</v>

213
00:09:58.531 --> 00:09:59.100
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

214
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.570
<v Speaker 2>that's a big bowl of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on man.</v>

215
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.670
<v Speaker 2>Come on Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

216
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.430
<v Speaker 2>but for something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some reason why it is okay in a</v>

217
00:10:05.431 --> 00:10:08.820
<v Speaker 2>band,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not okay for comic like a comic</v>

218
00:10:08.821 --> 00:10:13.290
<v Speaker 2>with long like led Zepplin here because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what happens when a comic does</v>

219
00:10:13.291 --> 00:10:15.660
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their whole act becomes about it and</v>

220
00:10:15.661 --> 00:10:16.650
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

221
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.740
<v Speaker 2>that's just boring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You remember Jackson Purdue?</v>

222
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.590
<v Speaker 2>I do remember Jackson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty crazy long hair.</v>

223
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.100
<v Speaker 2>Like a band guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of material about his hair.</v>

224
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.580
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I just,</v>

225
00:10:29.581 --> 00:10:30.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to,</v>

226
00:10:30.751 --> 00:10:32.520
<v Speaker 2>when I was younger I went for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>obvious,</v>

227
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.890
<v Speaker 2>I did a lot of material about having a</v>
<v Speaker 2>big head.</v>

228
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.110
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now it's of no interest to me.</v>

229
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.810
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't also do like the Robert</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plant shirt thing either.</v>

230
00:10:42.811 --> 00:10:45.870
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a Robert Plant shirt but not him</v>

231
00:10:45.871 --> 00:10:50.220
<v Speaker 2>or like let it open now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's called nurses do it better</v>

232

235
00:10:59.311 --> 00:11:01.230
<v Speaker 2>bought one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't give off the same pie.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They say people just chuckle.</v>

243
00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:17.090
<v Speaker 2>They don't know how to make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are,</v>

<v Speaker 2>people tried to bring back.</v>

247
00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.060
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you remember a few years back they</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how much of a failure it was.</v>

250
00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:40.250
<v Speaker 2>Bill Mary was actually photographed a</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of days ago at a golf course with</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

259
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:03.880

275
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.250
<v Speaker 2>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the end of my shows,</v>

276
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:41.670
<v Speaker 2>I always thank the audience for actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>leaving their homes to come see me</v>

277
00:12:42.911 --> 00:12:46.360

<v Speaker 2>ordinary life as I can.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'd go to a dinner party if he had one.</v>

295
00:13:26.321 --> 00:13:26.990
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

296
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:29.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm done though with the Jeff Ross</v>
<v Speaker 2>parties.</v>

297
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.800
<v Speaker 2>Jeff at all was a lot of parts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I love Jeff Ross,</v>

298
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:35.770
<v Speaker 2>but I am not going to anymore of his</v>
<v Speaker 2>parties.</v>

299
00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.200
<v Speaker 2>Tell him I'll go by myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was house,</v>

300
00:13:38.201 --> 00:13:40.360
<v Speaker 2>I did have them put two hands on his</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoulders.</v>

301
00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:41.920
<v Speaker 2>Tell him you love him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the way I will,</v>

302
00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to talk to him about the man</v>
<v Speaker 2>bun in the pool or like who?</v>

303
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:50.680
<v Speaker 2>Who are you friends with it as a man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a producer,</v>

304
00:13:50.681 --> 00:13:53.410
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's helping me with a project.</v>

305
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:56.630
<v Speaker 2>He didn't look like a producer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just snap the shoulders go,</v>

306
00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.570
<v Speaker 2>I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't come to your fucking pool</v>

307
00:13:58.571 --> 00:13:59.550
<v Speaker 2>parties anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>

308
00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:01.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it wasn't even a pool party.</v>

309
00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:03.040
<v Speaker 2>That was a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody went,</v>

310
00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:07.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to bring my suit</v>
<v Speaker 2>and getting the pool and he got in the</v>

311
00:14:07.541 --> 00:14:10.880
<v Speaker 2>pool with these two other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even really notice that man.</v>

312
00:14:10.881 --> 00:14:13.430
<v Speaker 2>But that's unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's not a pool party and you decide</v>

313
00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:16.000
<v Speaker 2>to get in the pool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's always awkward as fuck.</v>

314
00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.490
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't belong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

315
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.940
<v Speaker 2>You gotta be like a really comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 2>person to take off your clothes when</v>

316
00:14:21.941 --> 00:14:23.090
<v Speaker 2>everybody else has theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Good for you.</v>

318
00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:27.160

<v Speaker 2>I mean for me,</v>

319
00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm all comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

320
00:14:28.541 --> 00:14:31.720
<v Speaker 2>you're fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that I'm prone to the kid,</v>

321
00:14:31.721 --> 00:14:32.740
<v Speaker 2>you're angry at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

322
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.470
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw your little festival here.</v>

323
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:39.760
<v Speaker 2>You're really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your passions are comedy and fitness.</v>

324
00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.150
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>

325
00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:42.260
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one thing hard.</v>

326
00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:42.971
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

327
00:14:42.971 --> 00:14:45.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm just an American Werewolf in London.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

328
00:14:45.671 --> 00:14:47.260
<v Speaker 2>In the middle of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I recognize that.</v>

329
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:51.290
<v Speaker 2>I love that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's when he was in,</v>

330

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trafalgar Square.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

332
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:58.190
<v Speaker 2>I remember that moment of scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not happy unless I'm a exercising.</v>

333
00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.860
<v Speaker 2>I've tried both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Happy unless I'm napping.</v>

334
00:15:00.861 --> 00:15:03.620
<v Speaker 2>So we both have our ways about us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

335
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:06.470
<v Speaker 2>Well everybody's bodies by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I do exercise.</v>

336
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.980
<v Speaker 2>I eat well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eat gluten free,</v>

337
00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:14.390

<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>

338
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:15.860
<v Speaker 2>That's a good combination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

339
00:15:15.861 --> 00:15:19.940
<v Speaker 2>And I aspire to be more of a vegetarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not obsessed with it.</v>

340

<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>have and where they want to know.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Hilburn who was the critic for the La</v>
<v Speaker 2>Times.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's how much I do music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's Robert Hilburn.</v>

378
00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Henry gets it.</v>

379
00:17:01.551 --> 00:17:05.810
<v Speaker 2>Henry who obviously became famous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very Johnny Cash.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm looking for the day of voids cause I</v>

395
00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:44.180
<v Speaker 2>know I downloaded them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to own them.</v>

396
00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.300
<v Speaker 2>But how many people do you think owns</v>
<v Speaker 2>those speakers?</v>

397
00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:48.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought yesterday,</v>

398
00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:50.520
<v Speaker 2>but that person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have to be wealthy</v>

399
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.070
<v Speaker 3>or that's where you want to put your</v>
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>

400
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.590
<v Speaker 3>click on the yellow one that you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's that?</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's the same speaker except in</v>

402
00:17:57.331 --> 00:17:59.490
<v Speaker 3>yellow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are a big ballroom because they</v>

403
00:17:59.491 --> 00:18:02.140
<v Speaker 3>look like plumbing supplies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do.</v>

404
00:18:02.141 --> 00:18:03.900
<v Speaker 3>They don't look good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they look,</v>

405
00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:04.920
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they look good.</v>

406
00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:07.930
<v Speaker 3>I think they look futuristic again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here we go.</v>

407
00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:11.960
<v Speaker 3>Why we get fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was that by on,</v>

408
00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:16.890
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember the guy's name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why we get fat and the four hour body.</v>

409
00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:18.270
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

410
00:18:18.271 --> 00:18:20.610
<v Speaker 3>Tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's embarrassed and I learned stuff</v>

411
00:18:20.611 --> 00:18:21.441
<v Speaker 3>from both,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm,</v>

412
00:18:21.441 --> 00:18:24.990
<v Speaker 3>so I learned stuff about nutrition and</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff and I'm in my,</v>

413
00:18:24.991 --> 00:18:28.440
<v Speaker 3>at my most,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was three 20 and I'm currently in the</v>

414
00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:33.090
<v Speaker 3>two forties that's nine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm making the transition now to</v>

415
00:18:33.091 --> 00:18:38.091
<v Speaker 3>hopefully low to 30 somewhere in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>two twenties and then building up muscle</v>

416
00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.530
<v Speaker 3>and I'll never be fit like you.</v>

417
00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:41.131
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

418
00:18:41.131 --> 00:18:44.280
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that to insult myself in</v>

419
00:18:44.281 --> 00:18:45.780
<v Speaker 3>terms of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

420
00:18:45.781 --> 00:18:48.660

<v Speaker 3>this is a passion of yours.</v>

421
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:52.500
<v Speaker 3>It's not a passion of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to live life at a higher</v>

422
00:18:52.501 --> 00:18:54.810
<v Speaker 3>level and a better level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I feel good.</v>

423
00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:59.130
<v Speaker 3>I want to feel great and I already do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if I can improve on this,</v>

424
00:18:59.131 --> 00:19:00.600
<v Speaker 3>delightful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the big things,</v>

425
00:19:00.601 --> 00:19:05.601
<v Speaker 3>cutting carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people eat far too much for me.</v>

426
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:10.410
<v Speaker 3>That's where the gluten and the sugar</v>
<v Speaker 3>came from and the dairy.</v>

427
00:19:10.411 --> 00:19:12.540
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I feel good when my body not having</v>

428
00:19:12.541 --> 00:19:15.460
<v Speaker 3>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I react positively my,</v>

429
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:20.070
<v Speaker 3>so anything else is okay for me.</v>

434
00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:30.780

435
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:31.860
<v Speaker 3>playing tennis.</v>

436
00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:32.880
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow morning,</v>

437
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:33.721
<v Speaker 3>today's Wednesday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

438
00:19:33.721 --> 00:19:36.030
<v Speaker 3>Tomorrow morning I'll be playing with my</v>
<v Speaker 3>tennis teacher.</v>

439
00:19:36.031 --> 00:19:38.460
<v Speaker 3>I play golf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is not that physical.</v>

440
00:19:38.461 --> 00:19:40.270
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I went,</v>

441
00:19:40.271 --> 00:19:42.060
<v Speaker 3>it was at the store buying stuff the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other day,</v>

442
00:19:42.061 --> 00:19:43.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the golf story.</v>

443
00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.720
<v Speaker 3>And he wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy was very nice guy helping me,</v>

444
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:49.290
<v Speaker 3>wanted to sell me something that I have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to bend over to get the ball.</v>

445
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:52.020
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that bending over and as matter</v>

446
00:19:52.021 --> 00:19:53.580
<v Speaker 3>of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stretching my hamstrings,</v>

447
00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:56.100
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the benefit I'd get from</v>

448
00:19:56.101 --> 00:20:00.100
<v Speaker 3>golf if I didn't at leats bend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's telling you not to bend well that</v>

449
00:20:00.101 --> 00:20:01.770
<v Speaker 3>they have these things so people don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to bend.</v>

450
00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.390
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's for people that are like really</v>

451
00:20:03.391 --> 00:20:04.170
<v Speaker 3>bad back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

452
00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:04.531
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

453
00:20:04.531 --> 00:20:07.620
<v Speaker 3>It's for lazy people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I think a lot of people,</v>

454
00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.930
<v Speaker 3>so for me it's a matter of pride to</v>
<v Speaker 3>bend.</v>

455
00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.340
<v Speaker 3>If you have a bad back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you probably can't swing either.</v>

456
00:20:12.341 --> 00:20:14.500
<v Speaker 3>You can't swing a lot of you back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

457
00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.860
<v Speaker 3>but I do a lot of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love sports.</v>

458
00:20:16.861 --> 00:20:20.070
<v Speaker 3>I used to play when I was younger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I played baseball and football.</v>

459
00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:24.660
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever play golf or tennis rather</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Callan cause he's a tenant's freak.</v>

460
00:20:24.661 --> 00:20:25.530
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should actually,</v>

461
00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.810
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just started again and played tennis</v>

462
00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:30.210
<v Speaker 3>since I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually going to talk to him about</v>

463
00:20:30.211 --> 00:20:31.710
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully we can play some.</v>

464
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:35.010
<v Speaker 3>The thing about tennis though is it's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of like going left and right and</v>

465
00:20:35.011 --> 00:20:38.410
<v Speaker 3>left and right and putting weird strains</v>
<v Speaker 3>and pressures on rainier.</v>

466
00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:42.420
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's great for a bone mass.</v>

467
00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.061
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

468
00:20:43.061 --> 00:20:44.610
<v Speaker 3>It's good for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bone mass.</v>

469
00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.510
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

470
00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.430
<v Speaker 3>It pushes you pushing you pushing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

471
00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:48.310
<v Speaker 3>I dig it</v>

472
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:50.410
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to play competitive with</v>

473
00:20:50.411 --> 00:20:51.520
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to hit with him.</v>

474
00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.290
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he could probably beat me.</v>

475
00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.560
<v Speaker 2>Also weighs about 70 pounds less than</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

476
00:20:56.561 --> 00:20:58.110
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he can move better.</v>

477
00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.800
<v Speaker 2>Brian's been playing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's very spry.</v>

478
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.230
<v Speaker 2>He's his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He takes his physical fitness very</v>

479
00:21:02.231 --> 00:21:04.090
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't tell you about it.</v>

480
00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:05.170
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

481
00:21:05.171 --> 00:21:06.150
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

482
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:09.460
<v Speaker 2>He gets very serious about half thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>

483
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:12.700
<v Speaker 2>It gets very serious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

484
00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:16.570
<v Speaker 2>Like he's never going to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's never going to like commit to being</v>

485
00:21:16.571 --> 00:21:18.860
<v Speaker 2>like a professional tennis player.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

486
00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:22.930
<v Speaker 2>It'll get pretty serious about kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting into tennis.</v>

487
00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.060
<v Speaker 2>Who needs the stress?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

488
00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:29.880
<v Speaker 2>When no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying it's like a good balance.</v>

489
00:21:29.881 --> 00:21:33.160
<v Speaker 2>I guess he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get obsessed about things.</v>

490
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:36.790
<v Speaker 2>He gets obsessed about kind of getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>into things,</v>

491
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.990
<v Speaker 2>but then it doesn't go like those</v>
<v Speaker 2>started out doing through.</v>

492
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.820
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and go or look at you.</v>

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.030
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's possible.</v>

582
00:25:01.031 --> 00:25:03.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying I've never seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've not seen it,</v>

583
00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:06.160
<v Speaker 2>but it's like I'm not going to deem it</v>
<v Speaker 2>impossible.</v>

584
00:25:06.161 --> 00:25:08.950
<v Speaker 2>Cause then who am I and saw me saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no god.</v>

585
00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.890
<v Speaker 2>That's like me saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you who killed Kennedy.</v>

586
00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

587
00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:17.960
<v Speaker 2>And it's also what exactly is</v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment and by whose standard by</v>

588
00:25:17.961 --> 00:25:21.190
<v Speaker 2>definition was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe if you have a very low standard</v>

589
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:24.670
<v Speaker 2>for enlightenment and your reach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that level is,</v>

590
00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:26.980
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it in my lifetime.</v>

591
00:25:26.981 --> 00:25:27.814
<v Speaker 2>Look at me.</v>

592
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:30.470
<v Speaker 4>If you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're smoking,</v>

593
00:25:30.471 --> 00:25:32.750
<v Speaker 4>Endeca,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen to great music and having</v>

594
00:25:32.751 --> 00:25:36.830
<v Speaker 4>fantastic sex after a great meal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then someone says,</v>

595
00:25:36.831 --> 00:25:37.101
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

596
00:25:37.101 --> 00:25:38.780
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just supposed to meditate and</v>

597
00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.880
<v Speaker 4>just sit in a room and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

598
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:42.140
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

599
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:43.640
<v Speaker 4>be mindful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

600
00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:44.630
<v Speaker 4>How about fuck you?</v>

601
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:46.910
<v Speaker 2>How about a big ball of fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

602
00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.420
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we make that happen for me that I</v>

603
00:25:49.421 --> 00:25:53.470
<v Speaker 2>smoked some Minika listen to some music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have some great sex after a great meal.</v>

604
00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.210
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems that this,</v>

605
00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.050
<v Speaker 2>it can be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should,</v>

606
00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:58.240
<v Speaker 2>it can be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Garlin it should be done.</v>

607
00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:00.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what a Tony says to me.</v>

608
00:26:00.101 --> 00:26:01.810
<v Speaker 2>You're Jeff Garlin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony Hawk.</v>

609
00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:02.890
<v Speaker 2>Hinchcliffe yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

610
00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:04.120
<v Speaker 2>he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

611
00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:04.801
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

612
00:26:04.801 --> 00:26:06.880
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tend to be,</v>

613
00:26:06.881 --> 00:26:10.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm confident in my comedic skills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he should be.</v>

614
00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:11.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Funny Guy.</v>

615
00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:12.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But outside of that,</v>

616
00:26:12.371 --> 00:26:15.730
<v Speaker 2>I am not lacking in confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but leaving my house is,</v>

617
00:26:15.731 --> 00:26:16.660
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

618
00:26:16.661 --> 00:26:18.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite the effort.</v>

619
00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.460
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by whose definition is enlightenment?</v>

620
00:26:21.461 --> 00:26:25.900
<v Speaker 2>Because like say if you wanted to go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>a concert or you wanted to go to a great</v>

621
00:26:25.901 --> 00:26:27.580
<v Speaker 2>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what an enlightened person.</v>

622
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:29.110
<v Speaker 2>Enjoy a great movie.</v>

623
00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:34.060
<v Speaker 2>I would think my version of an</v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightened person would in fact enjoy a</v>

624
00:26:34.061 --> 00:26:35.190
<v Speaker 2>great movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

625
00:26:35.191 --> 00:26:39.190
<v Speaker 2>I've been enlightened to the concert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw James Brown when he first got out</v>

626
00:26:39.191 --> 00:26:44.191
<v Speaker 2>of prison and I've found that that that</v>
<v Speaker 2>performance he gave was the most</v>

627
00:26:45.241 --> 00:26:49.350
<v Speaker 2>enlightened performance I'd ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was this when he was in the car chase,</v>

628
00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:51.270
<v Speaker 2>was that that prison?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

629
00:26:51.271 --> 00:26:53.730
<v Speaker 2>it was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was the last prison he shot at cops</v>

630
00:26:53.731 --> 00:26:55.590
<v Speaker 2>because I believe so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

631
00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.550
<v Speaker 2>That one was someone else used his</v>
<v Speaker 2>bathroom,</v>

632
00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:01.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that what happened?</v>

633
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.700
<v Speaker 2>Someone took a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't know.</v>

634
00:27:02.701 --> 00:27:04.410
<v Speaker 2>I know that he got in trouble with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cops,</v>

635
00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:06.900
<v Speaker 2>but maybe it was that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

636
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:10.620
<v Speaker 2>There's a big difference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to someone using this toileting is</v>

637
00:27:10.621 --> 00:27:14.170
<v Speaker 2>that he had gotten out of prison and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the idea that James Brown was in</v>

638
00:27:14.171 --> 00:27:17.280
<v Speaker 2>prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think w maybe I remembering this</v>

639
00:27:17.281 --> 00:27:20.490
<v Speaker 2>incorrectly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think someone used his toilet and</v>

640
00:27:20.491 --> 00:27:25.380
<v Speaker 2>then he got mad at that person and shot</v>
<v Speaker 2>at something like either shot the wall</v>

641
00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:26.243
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>

642
00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:31.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember that story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I assume you're looking it up right</v>

643
00:27:31.021 --> 00:27:33.080
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we'll find out.</v>

644
00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:35.400
<v Speaker 2>I feel like he was in a high speed</v>
<v Speaker 2>chase.</v>

645
00:27:35.401 --> 00:27:37.770
<v Speaker 2>They shot his tires out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They shit.</v>

646
00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:41.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Show something in a car though.</v>

647
00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.430
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure they shot his tires out</v>

648
00:27:44.431 --> 00:27:47.430
<v Speaker 2>and he was driving around on my rims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had to have been doing a lot of</v>

649
00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:51.000
<v Speaker 2>blowers and making that agitated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

650
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:52.750
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Normal Human Doug.</v>

651
00:27:52.751 --> 00:27:55.920
<v Speaker 2>And we're talking about James Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that agitated?</v>

652
00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:56.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who gets that?</v>

653
00:27:56.861 --> 00:28:00.200
<v Speaker 2>And he was Finna fucking phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When does he or she was young to state</v>

654
00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:03.270
<v Speaker 2>chase that went up to 85 miles an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>involve 14 cars.</v>

655
00:28:03.271 --> 00:28:05.160
<v Speaker 2>He said he didn't stop because he feared</v>
<v Speaker 2>for his life though.</v>

656
00:28:05.161 --> 00:28:07.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't try to see why it started and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't see that.</v>

657
00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:10.360
<v Speaker 2>I feel like that that's what started it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

658
00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:13.920
<v Speaker 2>he fired off a gun because someone used</v>
<v Speaker 2>his toilet,</v>

659
00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:15.420
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a two stage chase.</v>

660
00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:18.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm guessing he lived near the border.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably lived in what I was wacky</v>

661
00:28:18.901 --> 00:28:19.980
<v Speaker 2>states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We live it.</v>

662
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:21.660
<v Speaker 2>We live in Georgia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

663
00:28:21.661 --> 00:28:23.070
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe it's like Georgia,</v>

664
00:28:23.071 --> 00:28:23.830
<v Speaker 2>Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

665
00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:26.100
<v Speaker 2>It could be close to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Georgia,</v>

666
00:28:26.101 --> 00:28:27.300
<v Speaker 2>Florida line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a band.</v>

667
00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.193
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

668
00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.940
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wheeler Walker make fun of them.</v>

669
00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:33.840
<v Speaker 2>It says you've failed a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Beta pullover.</v>

670
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:36.690
<v Speaker 2>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm pretty sure that's why they were</v>

671
00:28:36.691 --> 00:28:39.330
<v Speaker 2>pulling them over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they were going after him.</v>

672
00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might be wrong about that.</v>

673
00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.710
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm confusing him with.</v>

674
00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:46.500
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chuck Berry was the one who was filming</v>

675
00:28:46.501 --> 00:28:48.570
<v Speaker 2>people go into the bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

676
00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:53.370
<v Speaker 2>I think he liked to go in the piece like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the PM ladies,</v>

677
00:28:53.371 --> 00:28:53.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure.</v>

678
00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.010
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure,</v>

679
00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.170
<v Speaker 2>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>genuine.</v>

680
00:28:58.171 --> 00:29:01.350
<v Speaker 2>When I enjoy James Brown's music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not thinking about his car,</v>

681
00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:04.140
<v Speaker 2>thinking about his other side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

682
00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:06.120
<v Speaker 2>let's say that your story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

683
00:29:06.121 --> 00:29:07.890
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was right.</v>

684
00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:09.223
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here it goes.</v>

685
00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:12.030
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He carrying a deadly weapon in a public</v>

686
00:29:12.031 --> 00:29:15.150
<v Speaker 2>gathering and attempt to fleet perise</v>
<v Speaker 2>driving under the influence of drugs.</v>

687
00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:19.290
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He reportedly stormed into the insurance</v>

688
00:29:19.291 --> 00:29:22.590
<v Speaker 2>company next to his office waiting a</v>
<v Speaker 2>shotgun and complaining.</v>

689
00:29:22.591 --> 00:29:25.860
<v Speaker 2>That's trainers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We using his bathroom as time reported</v>

690
00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.720
<v Speaker 2>for six miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

691
00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:34.050
<v Speaker 2>Are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Years later this episode would frame the</v>

692
00:29:34.051 --> 00:29:37.260
<v Speaker 2>2014 j brown bio pic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

693
00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:40.470
<v Speaker 2>88 on up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm guessing that I saw him after this</v>

694
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.100
<v Speaker 2>cause it was right after</v>

695
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.180
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be,</v>

696
00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:46.210
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be late eighties,</v>

697
00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:47.750
<v Speaker 4>early nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>

698
00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:49.710

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

699
00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:51.910

<v Speaker 4>Six fucking years.</v>

700
00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:54.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about just sober him up?</v>

701
00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:59.380
<v Speaker 4>He was on PCP pay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They gave him a year for each mile.</v>

702
00:29:59.381 --> 00:30:03.160
<v Speaker 4>He drove on his Mac.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rumors of a PCP habit already surfaced</v>

703
00:30:03.161 --> 00:30:06.340
<v Speaker 4>by the time his erratic behavior came to</v>
<v Speaker 4>a head in September.</v>

704
00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.820
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>

707

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

714
00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.160
<v Speaker 4>when he opened up for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

715
00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:35.440
<v Speaker 4>the Mohammed Ali fight with George</v>
<v Speaker 4>Foreman documentary?</v>

716
00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:37.120
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was that incredible?</v>

717
00:30:37.121 --> 00:30:37.900
<v Speaker 4>That was incredible.</v>

718
00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:39.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Incredible.</v>

719
00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had so much power.</v>

720
00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:43.990
<v Speaker 4>There was something about him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

721
00:30:43.991 --> 00:30:46.630
<v Speaker 4>He would get on deck age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just power.</v>

722
00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:49.450
<v Speaker 4>Give you an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much power prince wished for that</v>

723
00:30:49.451 --> 00:30:50.290
<v Speaker 4>power fuck yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

724
00:30:50.291 --> 00:30:52.270
<v Speaker 4>prince had it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he had another way,</v>

725
00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:54.570
<v Speaker 4>different way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But prince looked up yet.</v>

726
00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:58.750
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>James Brown was ridiculous and I looked</v>

727
00:30:58.751 --> 00:30:59.500
<v Speaker 4>up to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

728
00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:02.160
<v Speaker 4>I don't have any musical talent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just tells you what a waste all of</v>

729
00:31:02.161 --> 00:31:06.040
<v Speaker 4>this was because Elvis had that power</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he didn't use it.</v>

730
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:11.290
<v Speaker 4>He had it early on and then w w he could</v>
<v Speaker 4>never dance like James Brown though.</v>

731
00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:12.900
<v Speaker 4>Or if he did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he never showed it.</v>

732
00:31:12.901 --> 00:31:15.730
<v Speaker 4>It would be different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a different kind of power if he</v>

733
00:31:15.731 --> 00:31:18.580
<v Speaker 4>just took and harness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here it is.</v>

734
00:31:18.581 --> 00:31:21.580
<v Speaker 4>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at his dress to get an ice chest,</v>

735
00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:25.990
<v Speaker 4>the fucking pants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they show you is God damn.</v>

736
00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:28.070
<v Speaker 4>Drop it down doing splits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

737
00:31:28.071 --> 00:31:29.140
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was not human.</v>

738
00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:30.273
<v Speaker 4>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

739
00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:34.030
<v Speaker 4>he's not even really flexible enough to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do a full split and yet he's still</v>

740
00:31:34.031 --> 00:31:35.950
<v Speaker 4>dropping down on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

741
00:31:35.951 --> 00:31:39.850
<v Speaker 4>he was wearing a turtle neck that night</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I said to him,</v>

742
00:31:39.851 --> 00:31:43.810
<v Speaker 4>cut that baby out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's leave a little bit.</v>

743
00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:48.220
<v Speaker 4>Let's put your initials on there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that that was done in advance</v>

744
00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:51.590
<v Speaker 4>what the girls was hanging around with</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking shame around.</v>

745
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:54.070
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at these giant ass band.</v>

746
00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:57.460
<v Speaker 4>I don't envy those people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know when you see people with</v>

747
00:31:57.461 --> 00:31:59.500
<v Speaker 4>bands,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Torin got all those people,</v>

748
00:31:59.501 --> 00:32:02.170
<v Speaker 4>all those working pieces have to fall</v>
<v Speaker 4>into place.</v>

749
00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:03.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they got all that though.</v>

750
00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but God damn would a performance.</v>

751
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:08.260
<v Speaker 4>When I saw him and I saw him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it blew my mind.</v>

752
00:32:08.261 --> 00:32:09.610
<v Speaker 4>It literally blew my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

753
00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.740
<v Speaker 4>what's interesting too is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

754
00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:15.850
<v Speaker 4>prince who died of painkillers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he died from fentanyl.</v>

755
00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:20.020
<v Speaker 4>He blew his hips out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dancing like that was,</v>

756
00:32:20.021 --> 00:32:21.280
<v Speaker 4>that was the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

757
00:32:21.281 --> 00:32:23.890
<v Speaker 4>and that that apparently is a very</v>
<v Speaker 4>common thing.</v>

758
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:27.010
<v Speaker 4>My friend Maynard Maynard Keenan from</v>
<v Speaker 4>tool lead Santa tool,</v>

759
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:31.030
<v Speaker 4>he just recently had his hip replaced</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he was doing,</v>

760
00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:32.860
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's big into Jujitsu,</v>

761
00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:37.890
<v Speaker 4>loves Jujitsu and he was having a really</v>
<v Speaker 4>hard time doing certain things.</v>

762
00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 4>So I went to a doctor to see what's</v>
<v Speaker 4>going on</v>

763
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.450
<v Speaker 3>with his hip and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

764
00:32:41.451 --> 00:32:42.940
<v Speaker 3>your hip is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sign.</v>

765
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:45.560
<v Speaker 3>Like it's just two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He functioning at a high level.</v>

766
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

767
00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:46.743
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's fine.</v>

768
00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:50.960
<v Speaker 3>That's the hip replacement is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>most unusual ones in terms of like its</v>

769
00:32:50.961 --> 00:32:55.961
<v Speaker 3>ability to restore you back to a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fairly normal state other than a bride</v>

770
00:32:56.530 --> 00:32:59.210
<v Speaker 3>being a comedian as delightful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we don't have to do any of that</v>

771
00:32:59.211 --> 00:33:00.010
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

772
00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:03.230
<v Speaker 3>there's no up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>

773
00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.050
<v Speaker 3>when you see someone moving around like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that on stage,</v>

774
00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.350
<v Speaker 3>I will bet you every penny I have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not funny.</v>

775
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:11.990
<v Speaker 3>Callen moves a lot on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's very funny.</v>

776
00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:15.800
<v Speaker 3>I hate as a move,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like like 20 throws kicked upstairs in</v>

777
00:33:15.801 --> 00:33:18.770
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the telly room and know the Improv</v>

778
00:33:18.771 --> 00:33:20.990
<v Speaker 3>upstairs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that Green Room thing?</v>

779
00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:23.930
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a monitor on stage with a thing</v>

780
00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:26.660
<v Speaker 3>and I will turn to our own weather go</v>
<v Speaker 3>funny.</v>

781
00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:32.030
<v Speaker 3>Not Funny because like I can watch and</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell how,</v>

782
00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:37.100
<v Speaker 3>whether the comedy is coming to them or</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether they're pushing it and most of</v>

783
00:33:37.101 --> 00:33:41.270
<v Speaker 3>the move around people are pushing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Jim Carrey was a move around guy.</v>

784
00:33:41.271 --> 00:33:44.780
<v Speaker 3>He was always really funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but move around in a different sort of</v>

785
00:33:44.781 --> 00:33:45.910
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Characters.</v>

786
00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:48.550
<v Speaker 3>Well there's exceptions to all stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

787
00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:51.820
<v Speaker 3>The all things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in this sort of way I'm done.</v>

788
00:33:51.821 --> 00:33:55.670
<v Speaker 3>But when someone just stands there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>talks and then they're doing some sort</v>

789
00:33:55.671 --> 00:33:57.200
<v Speaker 3>of movement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not good.</v>

790
00:33:57.410 --> 00:33:58.880
<v Speaker 3>Jim Carrey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a purpose,</v>

791
00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:01.550
<v Speaker 3>right Brian?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's part of who we is.</v>

792
00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:05.480
<v Speaker 3>That's not what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about people that just</v>

793
00:34:05.481 --> 00:34:10.481
<v Speaker 3>oversell shit by physicalizing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What should be just funny the way you</v>

794
00:34:11.121 --> 00:34:13.580
<v Speaker 3>say it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not even what you're saying.</v>

795
00:34:13.581 --> 00:34:16.700
<v Speaker 3>The way you say it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thompson or calls it dance moves it.</v>

796
00:34:16.701 --> 00:34:19.520
<v Speaker 3>His dance moves thompson girls.</v>

797
00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:20.640
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sick.</v>

798
00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:22.130
<v Speaker 3>Girl is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a genius.</v>

799
00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:24.530
<v Speaker 3>He uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to call it English putting like</v>

800
00:34:24.531 --> 00:34:26.000
<v Speaker 3>English on the two bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

801
00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:31.070
<v Speaker 3>Totally unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As is better dance moves.</v>

802
00:34:31.071 --> 00:34:33.980
<v Speaker 3>Damn moves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what I'm talking about.</v>

803
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:36.820
<v Speaker 3>So Jim Carrey and Brian Cowen do not</v>
<v Speaker 3>have danced with.</v>

804
00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:38.270
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just are funny.</v>

805
00:34:38.271 --> 00:34:39.290
<v Speaker 3>And they also move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

806
00:34:39.291 --> 00:34:42.890
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a reason for their moving moves.</v>

807
00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.000
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on man.</v>

808
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:45.710
<v Speaker 3>And you're always so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Years ago,</v>

809
00:34:45.711 --> 00:34:49.850
<v Speaker 3>I remember anytime I saw someone miming</v>
<v Speaker 3>having sex,</v>

810
00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:51.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pumping air,</v>

811

<v Speaker 3>Not Funny.</v>

812
00:34:52.910 --> 00:34:54.320
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just like,</v>

813
00:34:54.321 --> 00:34:56.630
<v Speaker 3>it was a sign of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what if there's a bit where you</v>

814
00:34:56.631 --> 00:34:59.690
<v Speaker 3>have to mime pumping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pumping air.</v>

815
00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:04.100
<v Speaker 3>There's gotta be a bit pumping air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You mean like it's gotta be some,</v>

816
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:05.420
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some bits.</v>

817
00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:07.550
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But who doesn't know what that looks</v>

818
00:35:07.551 --> 00:35:08.630
<v Speaker 3>like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you need to pump?</v>

819
00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:13.430
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there's a reason it's something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless like you're imitating someone</v>

820
00:35:13.431 --> 00:35:15.720
<v Speaker 3>having a heart attack pumping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

821
00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:16.960
<v Speaker 3>Or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there,</v>

822
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.120
<v Speaker 3>if the content is about your</v>
<v Speaker 3>physicality,</v>

823
00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:23.480
<v Speaker 3>that's not dancing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dancing's when you,</v>

824
00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:25.760
<v Speaker 3>when you put like English,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you,</v>

825
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.910
<v Speaker 3>when you're doing this to accentuate</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're saying,</v>

826
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:30.650
<v Speaker 3>it's like screw that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't need that.</v>

827
00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:35.480
<v Speaker 3>Well you ever go to open mic nights?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to do them up until recently.</v>

828
00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:37.770
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would just show up and</v>

829
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:40.200
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I go up and do 10 you know,</v>

830
00:35:40.201 --> 00:35:42.450
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what was really fun was when the</v>

831
00:35:42.451 --> 00:35:44.370
<v Speaker 2>person who had them didn't know who I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

832
00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:47.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I watched as other people</v>

833
00:35:47.251 --> 00:35:50.430
<v Speaker 2>explained and it was cool cause I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have an attitude,</v>

834
00:35:50.431 --> 00:35:53.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would do my sets and the audience</v>

835
00:35:53.241 --> 00:35:55.170
<v Speaker 2>has an open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike nights are really,</v>

836
00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.020
<v Speaker 2>they're terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lot of times,</v>

837
00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:59.160
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're there to see their friends or</v>

838
00:35:59.161 --> 00:36:03.120
<v Speaker 2>they're tired or whatever or they've</v>
<v Speaker 2>been beaten down by totally unfunny</v>

839
00:36:03.121 --> 00:36:05.970
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally unfunny shit over and over and</v>

840
00:36:05.971 --> 00:36:07.350
<v Speaker 2>over again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>

841
00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:11.340
<v Speaker 2>up until about four or five years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to go to open my,</v>

842
00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:15.270
<v Speaker 2>what's fascinating about open Mike</v>
<v Speaker 2>nights is you're watching people try to</v>

843
00:36:15.271 --> 00:36:18.480
<v Speaker 2>figure out how to be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're watching people like,</v>

844
00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.500
<v Speaker 2>and you go to the store like tonight and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll,</v>

845
00:36:21.501 --> 00:36:22.500
<v Speaker 2>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll go there.</v>

846
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:27.500
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be a packed house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all Chris Delea and fucking Andrew</v>

847
00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.310
<v Speaker 2>Santina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No and Allie Wong,</v>

848
00:36:30.311 --> 00:36:31.710
<v Speaker 2>it's all killers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

849
00:36:31.711 --> 00:36:34.110
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing high level comedy over and</v>

850
00:36:34.111 --> 00:36:36.810
<v Speaker 2>over again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you get you into that vibe and</v>

851
00:36:36.811 --> 00:36:38.220
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh this is a great place to be.</v>

852
00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:42.180
<v Speaker 2>But if you go to an open mic night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing this like primordial ooze.</v>

853
00:36:42.181 --> 00:36:45.660
<v Speaker 2>You're seeing single celled organisms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you really shouldn't be</v>

854
00:36:45.661 --> 00:36:47.550
<v Speaker 2>seeing sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

855
00:36:47.551 --> 00:36:49.140
<v Speaker 2>because every now and then you see a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little,</v>

856
00:36:49.141 --> 00:36:52.410
<v Speaker 2>I explained to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get as much state when you start,</v>

857
00:36:52.411 --> 00:36:55.440
<v Speaker 2>get as much stage time as you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>without people seeing you.</v>

858
00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.870
<v Speaker 2>That's good too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very good advice.</v>

859
00:36:57.930 --> 00:37:01.050
<v Speaker 2>But you need to go on stage over and</v>
<v Speaker 2>over and over again.</v>

860
00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:03.660
<v Speaker 2>But don't go on stage at any popular</v>
<v Speaker 2>places.</v>

861
00:37:03.661 --> 00:37:08.160
<v Speaker 2>Go onstage at the suckiest cause you</v>
<v Speaker 2>only learn from when you suck.</v>

862
00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:12.420
<v Speaker 2>That's a big part of it for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I really admired,</v>

863
00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:13.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Charlie Murphy.</v>

864
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:18.790
<v Speaker 2>Cause Charlie Murphy was essentially a</v>
<v Speaker 2>famous open miker and well when he</v>

865
00:37:18.841 --> 00:37:22.110
<v Speaker 2>started mean when he started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd never done standup comedy ever.</v>

866
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:25.860
<v Speaker 2>And then he was just a really funny</v>
<v Speaker 2>actor who is the brother of one of the</v>

867
00:37:25.861 --> 00:37:29.280
<v Speaker 2>greatest comics of all time who got on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Chappelle show and then started</v>

868
00:37:29.281 --> 00:37:31.110
<v Speaker 2>doing stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

869
00:37:31.111 --> 00:37:34.680
<v Speaker 2>Charlie would just just fucking do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just go and do it.</v>

870
00:37:34.681 --> 00:37:37.110
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had some rough sets too when he was</v>

871
00:37:37.111 --> 00:37:39.510
<v Speaker 2>famous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like really famous.</v>

872
00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:43.110
<v Speaker 2>Are you think when I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did those things that I didn't eat it</v>

873
00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.490
<v Speaker 2>plenty of times open mike nights</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>

874
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.860
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I had was I was in control of</v>

875
00:37:49.861 --> 00:37:52.680
<v Speaker 2>myself and it didn't fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

876
00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:55.250
<v Speaker 2>If you're an amateur would fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

877
00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:56.010
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>

878
00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:58.690
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean I did well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of course I remember,</v>

879
00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:02.640
<v Speaker 2>I remember one time dice came into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>store,</v>

880
00:38:02.641 --> 00:38:05.370
<v Speaker 2>this is probably four or five years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe five years ago.</v>

881
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:08.060
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he came up to me,</v>

882
00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:08.580
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

883
00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:10.170
<v Speaker 2>go up after you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

884
00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:11.790
<v Speaker 2>it was very respectful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very nice.</v>

885
00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:12.751
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

886
00:38:12.751 --> 00:38:15.510
<v Speaker 2>I really want to follow you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to see what that's like.</v>

887
00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:18.570
<v Speaker 2>I've never followed you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please go up there and go for broke.</v>

888
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:20.700
<v Speaker 2>Go for fucking broke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long are you doing?</v>

889
00:38:20.701 --> 00:38:21.451
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

890
00:38:21.451 --> 00:38:22.560
<v Speaker 2>maybe a half hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

891
00:38:22.561 --> 00:38:24.420
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go up there for a half hour.</v>

892
00:38:24.421 --> 00:38:27.570
<v Speaker 2>I've got nowhere to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to watch and the I want you to</v>

893
00:38:27.571 --> 00:38:30.870
<v Speaker 2>just to fucking hold nothing back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I went up after him.</v>

894
00:38:30.871 --> 00:38:33.840
<v Speaker 2>You know how I did fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't do good,</v>

895
00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:36.010
<v Speaker 2>didn't do fine</v>

896
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:39.400
<v Speaker 4>because I knew how to handle myself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my professionalism,</v>

897
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:44.910
<v Speaker 4>the craft of what I know one out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's no following that with what</v>

898
00:38:46.001 --> 00:38:48.010
<v Speaker 4>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is totally different.</v>

899
00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:49.960
<v Speaker 4>And having the audience go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

900
00:38:49.961 --> 00:38:52.240
<v Speaker 4>this takes it to a whole new place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

901
00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:54.850
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever listen to the day the</v>
<v Speaker 4>laughter died?</v>

902
00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:57.300
<v Speaker 4>Rick Rubin's with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

903
00:38:57.301 --> 00:38:57.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

904
00:38:57.790 --> 00:38:59.860
<v Speaker 4>Fucking phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Great album.</v>

905
00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:01.670
<v Speaker 4>Just eating shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

906
00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:05.620
<v Speaker 4>Chill hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He showed up at danger fields for people</v>

907
00:39:05.621 --> 00:39:07.240
<v Speaker 4>who don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's literally,</v>

908
00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:09.910
<v Speaker 4>I will never forget,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just starting out.</v>

909
00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:12.550
<v Speaker 4>I think he did this look this up when</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was,</v>

910
00:39:12.551 --> 00:39:16.270
<v Speaker 4>I want to say it was like 1989 1990 no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was after that.</v>

911
00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:20.500
<v Speaker 4>It was fairly early.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was fairly early because I was very</v>

912
00:39:20.501 --> 00:39:22.870
<v Speaker 4>young in my career.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might've been then cause I was still</v>

913
00:39:22.871 --> 00:39:24.030
<v Speaker 4>living in Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

914
00:39:24.031 --> 00:39:26.770
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might've been then because 89 yeah,</v>

915
00:39:26.771 --> 00:39:29.860
<v Speaker 4>because I was thinking about me living</v>
<v Speaker 4>here now,</v>

916
00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:32.800
<v Speaker 4>but it was the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it had came out the first time I lived</v>

917
00:39:32.801 --> 00:39:33.130
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

918
00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:37.660
<v Speaker 4>Well I was living in Boston and I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>just starting out and there was a great</v>

919
00:39:37.661 --> 00:39:40.470
<v Speaker 4>comedian named Mike Donovan who to this</v>
<v Speaker 4>day,</v>

920
00:39:40.471 --> 00:39:42.190
<v Speaker 4>he's one of the funniest guys I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 4>seen in my life.</v>

921
00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:45.550
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mike Donovan was laughing to the point</v>

922
00:39:45.551 --> 00:39:50.551
<v Speaker 4>where he couldn't breathe at dice doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>this set while he was doing fucking</v>

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.010
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't tell anybody he's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

930
00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:17.160
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's 1320 people in the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He records two different sets and he has</v>

931
00:40:18.491 --> 00:40:20.920
<v Speaker 4>no material.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean fucking none.</v>

932
00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:25.690
<v Speaker 4>He's making things up as he goes along</v>
<v Speaker 4>and people are getting angry at him and</v>

933
00:40:25.691 --> 00:40:30.490
<v Speaker 4>they're walking out and he did a bit</v>
<v Speaker 4>about Richard Nixon about how he eats</v>

934
00:40:30.491 --> 00:40:33.880
<v Speaker 4>ass and when he eats ass he does it like</v>
<v Speaker 4>Richard Nixon.</v>

935
00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:34.930
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

936
00:40:34.931 --> 00:40:38.590
<v Speaker 4>I love this fucking house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was doing this Richard Nixon</v>

937
00:40:38.591 --> 00:40:41.800
<v Speaker 4>impression of eating ass and for</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever reason Mike Dunn,</v>

938
00:40:41.801 --> 00:40:43.720
<v Speaker 4>Vin thought it was the funniest thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'd ever seen in his life.</v>

939
00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:46.390
<v Speaker 4>He was wheezing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like couldn't breathe,</v>

940
00:40:46.391 --> 00:40:49.330
<v Speaker 4>talking about dice doing this impression</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>

941
00:40:49.331 --> 00:40:53.020
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is like comedy for Comedians.</v>

942
00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:54.790
<v Speaker 4>But for the people that were in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>audience,</v>

943
00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:55.810
<v Speaker 4>like a guy got up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>

944
00:40:55.811 --> 00:40:57.670
<v Speaker 4>you're about as funny as our glass of</v>
<v Speaker 4>milk.</v>

945
00:40:57.910 --> 00:41:00.700
<v Speaker 4>The Guy said that to him and then left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the best things when the</v>

946
00:41:00.701 --> 00:41:03.210
<v Speaker 4>album,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these people from like Kansas getting</v>

947
00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:03.941
<v Speaker 4>your about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's funny,</v>

948
00:41:03.941 --> 00:41:07.390
<v Speaker 4>as our class on milk and walking off and</v>
<v Speaker 4>dice shitting on them,</v>

949
00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:12.310
<v Speaker 4>but the two to have them mindset to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the,</v>

950
00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:17.370
<v Speaker 4>not just the top of his game but</v>
<v Speaker 4>literally the top of standup ever.</v>

951
00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:23.310
<v Speaker 4>No one before him had ever sold out</v>
<v Speaker 4>Madison Square Garden multiple nights in</v>

952
00:41:24.611 --> 00:41:28.210
<v Speaker 4>a row the way he did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean guys have done it since then.</v>

953
00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:31.750
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dane and Louis and this been a bunch of</v>

954
00:41:31.751 --> 00:41:35.660
<v Speaker 4>guys who've Aziz,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no one did it like he did then.</v>

955
00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:40.690
<v Speaker 4>He was the first ever to do that and to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do that and then to record these fucking</v>

956
00:41:41.301 --> 00:41:43.640
<v Speaker 4>awful sets and then put it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

957
00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:48.700
<v Speaker 4>we'll go on a fucking pool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guaranteed that was Rick Ruben's</v>

958
00:41:48.831 --> 00:41:49.970
<v Speaker 4>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think so?</v>

959
00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:51.590
<v Speaker 4>Without a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

960
00:41:51.591 --> 00:41:52.500
<v Speaker 4>dice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dice,</v>

961
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:54.180
<v Speaker 4>dice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I know Rick Rubin.</v>

962
00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:58.570
<v Speaker 4>I bet it was both of their ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well maybe he didn't fight Rick Rubin up</v>

963
00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:00.220
<v Speaker 4>to ask Rick Ruben next time I see him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

964
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:01.430
<v Speaker 4>asked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>never asked him that.</v>

965
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:03.890
<v Speaker 4>But that sounds to me like Rick Rubin</v>
<v Speaker 4>going,</v>

966
00:42:03.891 --> 00:42:05.570
<v Speaker 4>let's do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>

967
00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:08.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it was such a crazy bold move.</v>

968
00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:12.410
<v Speaker 4>I remember thinking at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I was terrible in 1989 when it</v>

969
00:42:12.411 --> 00:42:15.260
<v Speaker 4>came out and I was just like confused.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how does one do that?</v>

970
00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:18.860
<v Speaker 4>Like one is so confident they release</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that suck.</v>

971
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:20.550
<v Speaker 4>Cause I had as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was a,</v>

972
00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:23.180
<v Speaker 4>when I was 19,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was me and my girlfriend,</v>

973
00:42:23.181 --> 00:42:28.181
<v Speaker 4>Mark De mi and Marta were sitting in my</v>
<v Speaker 4>car and I had a cassette player and</v>

974
00:42:28.851 --> 00:42:33.140
<v Speaker 4>we're listening to dice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just called dice and w crying,</v>

975
00:42:33.141 --> 00:42:34.040
<v Speaker 4>laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crying,</v>

976
00:42:34.041 --> 00:42:35.930
<v Speaker 4>laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was before I'd ever done standup.</v>

977
00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:37.760
<v Speaker 4>And I remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>

978
00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:40.810
<v Speaker 4>this guy is fucking something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what,</v>

979
00:42:40.811 --> 00:42:41.730
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the,</v>

980
00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:44.800
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the amount of power that he had like on</v>

981
00:42:44.801 --> 00:42:47.660
<v Speaker 4>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And these are the roars from the crowd</v>

982
00:42:47.661 --> 00:42:51.080
<v Speaker 4>and we're sitting in my car laughing our</v>
<v Speaker 4>asses off to this seat.</v>

983
00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:53.120
<v Speaker 4>This cassette wasn't even cd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

984
00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:57.260
<v Speaker 4>that couple years later he decided I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>just going to put out something that's</v>

985
00:42:57.261 --> 00:42:58.094
<v Speaker 4>sucks.</v>

986
00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:01.610
<v Speaker 4>The day the comedy died.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did they?</v>

987
00:43:01.611 --> 00:43:02.670

<v Speaker 4>paper Boi hats on the cover.</v>

<v Speaker 4>edit it together himself,</v>

1079
00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:03.240
<v Speaker 4>but he did nothing with it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The comics would just do it.</v>

00:47:14.611 --> 00:47:16.980
<v Speaker 4>road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would just do the store all the time.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I was like yeah,</v>

1093
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:33.520
<v Speaker 2>why don't I do the road cause I was just</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing tv shows and then you know,</v>

1094
00:47:33.521 --> 00:47:36.490
<v Speaker 2>do you do on TV shows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You kind of trapped in this,</v>

1095
00:47:36.491 --> 00:47:40.180
<v Speaker 2>this is how you make your living.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to kind of always be acting and</v>

1096
00:47:40.181 --> 00:47:43.150
<v Speaker 2>always be going on auditions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like yeah I was cause I wasn't</v>

1097
00:47:43.151 --> 00:47:45.130
<v Speaker 2>making,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't make real money at the store.</v>

1098
00:47:45.131 --> 00:47:47.020
<v Speaker 2>You make like 15 bucks a set or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>you make.</v>

1099
00:47:47.021 --> 00:47:50.800
<v Speaker 2>You know I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've spent one year I'd ever collected a</v>

1100
00:47:50.801 --> 00:47:53.710
<v Speaker 2>check and then they'd ever had them</v>

1101
00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:54.573

<v Speaker 2>I probably,</v>

1102
00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:59.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm guessing that the number of sets I</v>
<v Speaker 2>did probably about $2,500 $5,000</v>

1103
00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:01.510

<v Speaker 2>it's incredible.</v>

1117
00:48:31.951 --> 00:48:35.060
<v Speaker 2>It's the room that's got it going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The main wildlife,</v>

1118
00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.250
<v Speaker 2>all three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1119
00:48:36.251 --> 00:48:37.840
<v Speaker 2>they're all different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The belly rooms.</v>

1120
00:48:37.841 --> 00:48:39.520
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the main room,</v>

1121
00:48:39.610 --> 00:48:40.210
<v Speaker 2>Eric,</v>

1122
00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:42.040
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the main room performing in the main</v>

1123
00:48:42.041 --> 00:48:43.900
<v Speaker 3>room does not bother me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate it.</v>

1124
00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:46.490
<v Speaker 2>The green room really hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1125
00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:49.750
<v Speaker 3>No cane piano in the middle of the room</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the best piano.</v>

1126
00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:52.600
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The point being is most of those people,</v>

1127
00:48:52.601 --> 00:48:53.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1128
00:48:53.891 --> 00:48:55.320
<v Speaker 3>hey around back there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1129
00:48:55.321 --> 00:48:56.270
<v Speaker 3>They just steer it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1130
00:48:56.290 --> 00:49:01.150
<v Speaker 3>There's just such a negative vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's a lot of comedians</v>

1131
00:49:01.151 --> 00:49:03.370
<v Speaker 3>at play there that are a big bowl of</v>
<v Speaker 3>dead weight.</v>

1132
00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:04.510
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1133
00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:06.430
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's a lot on the names,</v>

1134
00:49:06.431 --> 00:49:08.680
<v Speaker 3>but Baba,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's a lot that are joyful and</v>

1135
00:49:08.681 --> 00:49:11.800
<v Speaker 3>great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I dig and I like watching and my</v>

1136
00:49:11.801 --> 00:49:15.130
<v Speaker 3>favorite thing to do is laugh at my</v>
<v Speaker 3>fellow Comedians,</v>

1137
00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:17.890
<v Speaker 3>but on the flip side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people just,</v>

1138
00:49:17.891 --> 00:49:18.760
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're there.</v>

1139
00:49:18.761 --> 00:49:22.060
<v Speaker 3>Their presence just depresses me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

1140
00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:23.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel that.</v>

1141
00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:27.150
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe do an impression of</v>

1142
00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:32.660
<v Speaker 3>just mimed my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1143
00:49:32.661 --> 00:49:33.221
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1144
00:49:33.221 --> 00:49:33.731
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1145
00:49:33.731 --> 00:49:34.750
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1146
00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:36.520
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But some really,</v>

1147
00:49:36.521 --> 00:49:37.810
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1148
00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:40.210
<v Speaker 3>because you know the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I started in comedy,</v>

1149
00:49:40.211 --> 00:49:43.600
<v Speaker 3>which is 82 working through comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

1150
00:49:43.601 --> 00:49:46.540
<v Speaker 3>we're a group that stuck together.</v>

1151
00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:48.090
<v Speaker 3>You don't think that's the case now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1152
00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:50.620
<v Speaker 3>I think that bridge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think for the past,</v>

1153
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:55.950
<v Speaker 3>I think it started changing in late</v>
<v Speaker 3>nineties two thousands to where it was</v>

1154
00:49:57.461 --> 00:50:00.400
<v Speaker 3>every man for himself and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1155
00:50:00.401 --> 00:50:03.280
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're part of this fraternity.</v>

1156
00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:05.110
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you,</v>

1157
00:50:05.111 --> 00:50:06.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1158
00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:11.140
<v Speaker 3>My thing with competition is I go do</v>
<v Speaker 3>your thing.</v>

1159
00:50:11.141 --> 00:50:12.670
<v Speaker 3>If the audience digs you more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>

1160
00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:14.670
<v Speaker 3>If I'm auditioning and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>auditioning,</v>

1161
00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:17.050
<v Speaker 3>go beat me in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a crap,</v>

1162
00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:22.450
<v Speaker 3>but there's such a competitiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know that's part of why Eddie</v>

1163
00:50:22.451 --> 00:50:26.350
<v Speaker 3>doesn't do spots because Eddie Murphy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eddie Murphy,</v>

1164
00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 3>because when I work with them,</v>

1165
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:29.270
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you go?</v>

1166
00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.380
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd say,</v>

1167
00:50:30.381 --> 00:50:32.630
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the looks that I get and the vibe that I</v>

1168
00:50:32.631 --> 00:50:34.970
<v Speaker 2>get from comics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not pleasant.</v>

1169
00:50:34.971 --> 00:50:36.710
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know exactly what he was talking</v>

1170
00:50:36.711 --> 00:50:38.450
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so weird.</v>

1171
00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:43.480
<v Speaker 2>I have the exact opposite feeling about</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy now and about a particular,</v>

1172
00:50:44.211 --> 00:50:47.270
<v Speaker 2>like the store and like the comradery of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that place.</v>

1173
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:48.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get it,</v>

1174
00:50:48.321 --> 00:50:50.600
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dig a lot of people there,</v>

1175
00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:53.430
<v Speaker 2>but the people who I dig know I dig them</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1176
00:50:53.570 --> 00:50:54.630
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the other one,</v>

1177
00:50:54.631 --> 00:50:56.360
<v Speaker 2>so I don't dig,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know anything.</v>

1178
00:50:56.361 --> 00:51:01.280
<v Speaker 2>It's not like I spent hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's lots of guys and gals that</v>

1179
00:51:01.281 --> 00:51:05.150
<v Speaker 2>are great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so plenty of them that like please</v>

1180
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:07.400
<v Speaker 2>step away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just having a conversation about</v>

1181
00:51:07.401 --> 00:51:10.850
<v Speaker 2>this with a friend of mine recently who</v>
<v Speaker 2>was living for a while and the place</v>

1182
00:51:10.851 --> 00:51:11.684
<v Speaker 2>that he hated.</v>

1183
00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:15.470
<v Speaker 2>And he was saying that if you're in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>place where everyone's negative,</v>

1184
00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:18.950
<v Speaker 2>you really kind of forget that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be positive without a doubt.</v>

1185
00:51:18.970 --> 00:51:21.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why should I leave the comedy store</v>

1186
00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:24.620
<v Speaker 2>and at least half of the Times I play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're leaving.</v>

1187
00:51:24.621 --> 00:51:27.650
<v Speaker 2>They're driving home feeling like not</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive.</v>

1188
00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:30.140
<v Speaker 2>That's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas by the way,</v>

1189
00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:33.410
<v Speaker 2>I sometimes now arrange it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only set that I do at the comedy</v>

1190
00:51:33.411 --> 00:51:38.411
<v Speaker 2>store now is I sometimes will close the</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven o'clock original room show.</v>

1191
00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:41.900
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause there's no one after me.</v>

1192
00:51:41.901 --> 00:51:44.390
<v Speaker 2>So if I'm five minutes long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one's giving you crap.</v>

1193
00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:47.270
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they've already seen the whole show.</v>

1194
00:51:47.271 --> 00:51:50.660
<v Speaker 2>There's no it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I can do that zip and do it and get</v>

1195
00:51:50.661 --> 00:51:53.390
<v Speaker 2>the hell out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do a benefit in the,</v>

1196
00:51:53.391 --> 00:51:56.630
<v Speaker 2>in the main room or like I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1197
00:51:57.170 --> 00:51:58.610
<v Speaker 2>Tony Show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1198
00:51:58.850 --> 00:51:59.990
<v Speaker 2>Killed Tony killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1199
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:02.960
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna bring into the fold Jeff</v>
<v Speaker 2>Garlin bring wedding to the fitting you</v>

1200
00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:06.470
<v Speaker 2>into the fold of the nice people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

1201
00:52:06.471 --> 00:52:09.410
<v Speaker 2>I know the Nice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have nice conversations with him,</v>

1202
00:52:09.411 --> 00:52:13.700
<v Speaker 2>but the other people are always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're hovering hangovers.</v>

1203
00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:17.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't like I'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like a hover over is a stopover.</v>

1204
00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:21.020
<v Speaker 2>And Ted is brutal when you're having a</v>
<v Speaker 2>good conversation and if you're not into</v>

1205
00:52:21.021 --> 00:52:23.360
<v Speaker 2>a group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your group is not about making</v>

1206
00:52:23.361 --> 00:52:24.300
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1207
00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:26.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't care whether your political,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social,</v>

1208
00:52:26.781 --> 00:52:31.781
<v Speaker 2>w w how you do your comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if your ultimate goal isn't to bring</v>

1209
00:52:33.651 --> 00:52:37.370
<v Speaker 2>joy into peoples lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the purpose?</v>

1210
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:42.170
<v Speaker 2>If it's not about the laughs and joy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I find,</v>

1211
00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:46.250
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't dig lot of ego running around</v>

1212
00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:49.460
<v Speaker 2>the store when I'm there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And most of the people I don't like have</v>

1213
00:52:49.461 --> 00:52:50.510
<v Speaker 2>the biggest egos.</v>

1214
00:52:50.810 --> 00:52:54.530
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that the most common you</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're a very accomplished guy,</v>

1215
00:52:54.531 --> 00:52:56.480
<v Speaker 2>so maybe that's why you're getting that</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird vibe.</v>

1216
00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:58.850
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been told that before,</v>

1217
00:52:59.090 --> 00:53:00.770
<v Speaker 2>but if I thought that that would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>

1218
00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:03.380
<v Speaker 2>So I don't maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's cause you know,</v>

1219
00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:05.000
<v Speaker 2>there's a great line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an,</v>

1220
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:08.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an alcoholic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do know this line from the</v>

1221
00:53:08.481 --> 00:53:11.600
<v Speaker 2>program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what you think of me is none of</v>

1222
00:53:11.601 --> 00:53:13.850
<v Speaker 2>my business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I love.</v>

1223
00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:16.070
<v Speaker 2>That's a great perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great perspective.</v>

1224
00:53:16.071 --> 00:53:18.680
<v Speaker 2>So what they think of me is none of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>

1225
00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:20.780
<v Speaker 2>I just know what they're putting out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1226
00:53:21.490 --> 00:53:22.281
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1227
00:53:22.281 --> 00:53:24.440
<v Speaker 2>I think sometimes people will look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and go,</v>

1228
00:53:24.441 --> 00:53:25.740
<v Speaker 2>well here's a guy who has been on</v>

1229
00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:29.100
<v Speaker 3>some of the all time greatest television</v>
<v Speaker 3>shows ever.</v>

1230
00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:29.890
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

1231
00:53:29.890 --> 00:53:33.990
<v Speaker 3>your guy that's got a massive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like your,</v>

1232
00:53:33.991 --> 00:53:35.250
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your resume,</v>

1233
00:53:35.251 --> 00:53:37.910
<v Speaker 3>your accomplishments as a comic and</v>
<v Speaker 3>performers.</v>

1234
00:53:37.911 --> 00:53:42.911
<v Speaker 3>It's very enviable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So maybe perhaps a city like this myself</v>

1235
00:53:43.141 --> 00:53:46.170
<v Speaker 3>as a generous guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm every level.</v>

1236
00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:49.410
<v Speaker 3>I like being generous and I like helping</v>
<v Speaker 3>comics,</v>

1237
00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:51.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sticking my hand out,</v>

1238
00:53:51.121 --> 00:53:56.121
<v Speaker 3>doing what I can to help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't feel that I put anything that</v>

1239
00:53:56.431 --> 00:53:58.470
<v Speaker 3>they should be fearful of out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1240
00:53:58.471 --> 00:54:02.310
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's their own issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I remember when I was yes,</v>

1241
00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:04.650
<v Speaker 3>but I was starting out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would get real uncomfortable when I</v>

1242
00:54:04.651 --> 00:54:06.510
<v Speaker 3>was around really famous people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

1243
00:54:06.511 --> 00:54:08.910
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this feels weird to be around this guy</v>

1244
00:54:08.911 --> 00:54:10.800
<v Speaker 3>in real life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I get that.</v>

1245
00:54:10.801 --> 00:54:14.310
<v Speaker 3>That can be you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've always been very,</v>

1246
00:54:14.490 --> 00:54:16.450
<v Speaker 3>very friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I want to do.</v>

1247
00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:20.550
<v Speaker 3>I like to be a warm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thoughtful person who most of the time</v>

1248
00:54:20.551 --> 00:54:23.460
<v Speaker 3>prefers to stay at home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I'm going to go out,</v>

1249
00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:25.590
<v Speaker 3>if I'm going to go to the farmer's</v>
<v Speaker 3>market,</v>

1250
00:54:25.591 --> 00:54:29.310
<v Speaker 3>if I'm going to go to the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm prepared to talk to people,</v>

1251
00:54:29.311 --> 00:54:31.920
<v Speaker 3>take pictures of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be warmed to people,</v>

1252
00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:34.980
<v Speaker 3>engage with people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause if I don't want that,</v>

1253
00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:36.120
<v Speaker 3>I stay home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1254
00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:39.030
<v Speaker 3>And so if I'm in a negative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad mood,</v>

1255
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:42.930
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really will go do my set and get out.</v>

1256
00:54:42.931 --> 00:54:45.960
<v Speaker 3>But that doesn't happen very often.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'll stay home.</v>

1257
00:54:46.110 --> 00:54:47.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you need that downtime,</v>

1258
00:54:47.491 --> 00:54:49.980
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause you gotta be able to recharge.</v>

1259
00:54:50.050 --> 00:54:51.780
<v Speaker 3>Gotta be able to recharge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I never,</v>

1260
00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:55.110
<v Speaker 3>I used to not allow myself that I used</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be worked so hard.</v>

1261
00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:57.600
<v Speaker 3>I was reading this article yesterday</v>
<v Speaker 3>about Tom Cruise,</v>

1262
00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:00.420
<v Speaker 3>about Tom Cruise's life being very</v>
<v Speaker 3>strange.</v>

1263
00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:03.390
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeff Garland has going on with your</v>

1264
00:55:03.391 --> 00:55:04.290
<v Speaker 3>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was that?</v>

1265
00:55:04.690 --> 00:55:05.880
<v Speaker 3>My brother Ringer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that,</v>

1266
00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:09.790
<v Speaker 3>it's a theme to a man and a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a Duh,</v>

1267
00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:12.180
<v Speaker 3>Duh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Duh.</v>

1268
00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:13.480
<v Speaker 3>Do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

1269
00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:15.600
<v Speaker 3>do no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When a man and a woman is,</v>

1270
00:55:15.690 --> 00:55:18.190
<v Speaker 3>I thought it's a French movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's,</v>

1271
00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:20.910
<v Speaker 3>but hold on a second here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How am I supposed to know that?</v>

1272
00:55:20.970 --> 00:55:25.490
<v Speaker 3>But actually I actually sing that with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know jeff who plays piano in the</v>

1273
00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:28.170
<v Speaker 3>Jeff,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And the audience,</v>

1278
00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:36.980

<v Speaker 3>and I sing.</v>

1283
00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:52.290

<v Speaker 3>I tell the audience that I'm in a very</v>

1284
00:55:52.291 --> 00:55:55.020
<v Speaker 3>accomplished at French jibberish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what it is.</v>

1285
00:55:55.690 --> 00:55:56.580
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

1286

<v Speaker 3>I was listening to his buddy guy.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but he guys' newest album,</v>

1291
00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:13.080

<v Speaker 3>Of course it is.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he rips it the whole hour.</v>

1295
00:56:19.770 --> 00:56:23.220
<v Speaker 3>He said magazines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that inspires me to still,</v>

1296
00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:24.220
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

1297
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:26.590
<v Speaker 2>everything about aging is about</v>
<v Speaker 2>relevancy.</v>

1298
00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:28.240
<v Speaker 2>How are you contributing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1299
00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:29.970
<v Speaker 2>Like George Carlin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one would care.</v>

1300
00:56:30.090 --> 00:56:31.810
<v Speaker 2>The George Cardinal was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't matter.</v>

1301
00:56:31.811 --> 00:56:33.580
<v Speaker 2>75 or whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't matter.</v>

1302
00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:35.470
<v Speaker 2>He's relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's tripping Ireland.</v>

1303
00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:40.780
<v Speaker 2>That's what I aspire to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Relevancy to contribute to mankind,</v>

1304
00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:42.430
<v Speaker 2>to my art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to everything.</v>

1305
00:56:42.610 --> 00:56:45.100
<v Speaker 2>So I'll never be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1306
00:56:45.250 --> 00:56:50.200
<v Speaker 2>if someone says who's that old dude and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing anything based on what I'm</v>

1307
00:56:50.201 --> 00:56:52.390
<v Speaker 2>aspiring to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's their issue.</v>

1308
00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:52.901
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1309
00:56:52.901 --> 00:56:56.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I will be to my best ability.</v>

1310
00:56:56.261 --> 00:56:58.360
<v Speaker 2>Relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting perspective</v>

1311
00:56:58.361 --> 00:57:00.430
<v Speaker 2>because it's really true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's something that people don't</v>

1312
00:57:00.431 --> 00:57:01.450
<v Speaker 2>think about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1313
00:57:01.451 --> 00:57:03.490
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like rock stars in particular,</v>

1314
00:57:03.491 --> 00:57:06.640
<v Speaker 2>like no one looks at Mick Jagger and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is that guy still doing it?</v>

1315
00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:08.260
<v Speaker 2>Because when you watch him do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1316
00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:10.300
<v Speaker 2>oh Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's still doing it.</v>

1317
00:57:10.301 --> 00:57:11.600
<v Speaker 2>He's still doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1318
00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:13.130
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

1319
00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:16.390
<v Speaker 2>Watching them live is ridiculous by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1320
00:57:16.391 --> 00:57:21.190
<v Speaker 2>He really moves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No kidding around like at the oldest 30</v>

1321
00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:22.780
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he looks phenomenal.</v>

1322
00:57:22.781 --> 00:57:26.470
<v Speaker 2>He's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's 70 70 something still shooting</v>

1323
00:57:26.471 --> 00:57:29.230
<v Speaker 2>loads into hot models.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a baby recently.</v>

1324
00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:32.560
<v Speaker 2>That's my stage name by that is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my band.</v>

1325
00:57:32.590 --> 00:57:34.600
<v Speaker 2>How do you have that state name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's my band's name.</v>

1326
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:37.780
<v Speaker 2>I didn't license it though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'll give it back to you.</v>

1327
00:57:37.781 --> 00:57:40.310
<v Speaker 2>I put my apologies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bruce springsteen's another one</v>

1328
00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:43.030
<v Speaker 2>springsteen's in his sixties I saw that</v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

1329
00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:46.630
<v Speaker 2>I saw that show and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my jaw was on the floor.</v>

1330
00:57:46.631 --> 00:57:49.390
<v Speaker 2>I could not believe that's Broadway show</v>
<v Speaker 2>Broadway show.</v>

1331
00:57:49.570 --> 00:57:52.140
<v Speaker 2>It was one of the greatest things I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever seen before.</v>

1332
00:57:52.141 --> 00:57:55.690
<v Speaker 2>He turns to Morrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

1333
00:57:55.930 --> 00:57:59.470
<v Speaker 2>And he works out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe twice a day.</v>

00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:00.970
<v Speaker 2>Every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does he really?</v>

1335
00:58:00.971 --> 00:58:05.971
<v Speaker 2>He does yoga and he trains with weights</v>
<v Speaker 2>and see if he could find Mick Jagger</v>

1336
00:58:06.641 --> 00:58:08.470
<v Speaker 2>shirtless.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's just ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1369
00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:40.700
<v Speaker 2>Incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mick Jagger at Diet and exercise</v>

1370
00:59:40.701 --> 00:59:41.930
<v Speaker 2>program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Live long,</v>

1371
00:59:41.931 --> 00:59:45.170
<v Speaker 2>long stay young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if he only eats peppers?</v>

1372
00:59:48.770 --> 00:59:50.810
<v Speaker 2>I was just in Thailand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1373
00:59:50.930 --> 00:59:53.270
<v Speaker 2>when you go to the bathroom right by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>toilet,</v>

1374
00:59:53.271 --> 00:59:57.710
<v Speaker 2>they literally have one of those garden</v>
<v Speaker 2>hoses that you would wash a car with.</v>

1375
00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:00.980
<v Speaker 2>Play with big days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because with those peppers,</v>

1376
01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:04.190
<v Speaker 2>are you eating that Thai food?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this kind of splatter that you're</v>

1377
01:00:04.191 --> 01:00:06.770
<v Speaker 2>creating that like let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's be honest.</v>

1378
01:00:06.771 --> 01:00:09.860
<v Speaker 2>Toilet paper is not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to need a hose down.</v>

1379
01:00:09.861 --> 01:00:13.370
<v Speaker 2>So funny if there was a guy waiting</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside the bathroom to explain that to</v>

1380
01:00:13.371 --> 01:00:15.190
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just walk out,</v>

1381
01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:17.930
<v Speaker 2>he says you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're probably a little confused but</v>

1382
01:00:17.931 --> 01:00:20.820
<v Speaker 2>toilet papers and I'd explain it or</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing there.</v>

1383
01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:24.620
<v Speaker 2>There's something that I put up on my</v>
<v Speaker 2>instagram today about a sign that I saw</v>

1384
01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:26.330
<v Speaker 2>that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please don't pee on the floor.</v>

1385
01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:29.120
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people have to pee on the floor</v>

1386
01:00:29.121 --> 01:00:32.330
<v Speaker 2>before you put a sign up that says</v>
<v Speaker 2>please don't pee on the floor.</v>

1387
01:00:32.570 --> 01:00:34.160
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a person who pees on the</v>

1388
01:00:34.161 --> 01:00:35.720
<v Speaker 2>floor,</v>

1392
01:00:42.381 --> 01:00:43.790

<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

1393
01:00:43.791 --> 01:00:48.791
<v Speaker 2>the truth is about Floor Ping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It it p ends up on the floor.</v>

<v Speaker 2>agree with.</v>

1398
01:00:56.690 --> 01:01:00.860
<v Speaker 2>Some guy said because of Smartphones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pee sitting down much more than I</v>

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1406
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:17.090
<v Speaker 2>I can look at people with their phones.</v>

1407
01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:17.901
<v Speaker 2>That's a whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1409
01:01:21.081 --> 01:01:25.280
<v Speaker 2>I do not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as a avoiding being in the present,</v>

1410
01:01:25.310 --> 01:01:26.420
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They're addictive.</v>

1412
01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:29.810
<v Speaker 2>Very addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

1413
01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:33.230
<v Speaker 2>I gotta be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the last show where</v>

1414
01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:36.350
<v Speaker 2>somebody didn't pull out their phone the</v>
<v Speaker 2>last show,</v>

1415
01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:39.860
<v Speaker 2>like when people are texting people or</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone is,</v>

1416
01:01:39.861 --> 01:01:44.060
<v Speaker 2>even if it's one person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even remember somebody not doing</v>

1417
01:01:44.061 --> 01:01:45.380
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the ultimate,</v>

1418
01:01:45.381 --> 01:01:46.850
<v Speaker 2>that's so disrespectful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>no one had their phone and you just sit</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but I don't let stand how toby toby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Fuck him.</v>

1449
01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:49.530
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a call coming in.</v>

1450
01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:52.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to leave the show to answer</v>
<v Speaker 2>the phone.</v>

1451
01:02:52.621 --> 01:02:54.480
<v Speaker 2>Tell me what your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your buyer to the Caribbean movie is</v>

1452
01:02:54.481 --> 01:02:55.710
<v Speaker 2>your favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1453
01:02:55.711 --> 01:02:57.750
<v Speaker 2>all of them are fucking huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Johnny Depp found</v>

1454
01:02:59.670 --> 01:03:00.120
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons,</v>

1455
01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.890
<v Speaker 4>it's why I did that because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1456
01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:06.000
<v Speaker 4>cause Chapelle was telling me how much</v>
<v Speaker 4>he enjoys it and Hannibal,</v>

1457
01:03:06.001 --> 01:03:08.490
<v Speaker 4>Hannibal burress who tell me how much he</v>
<v Speaker 4>enjoys using those bags too.</v>

1458
01:03:08.491 --> 01:03:11.580
<v Speaker 4>But another reason was this woman</v>
<v Speaker 4>complained that,</v>

1459
01:03:11.610 --> 01:03:14.220
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when she went to my new year show that</v>

1460
01:03:14.221 --> 01:03:19.110
<v Speaker 4>some girl behind her made two separate</v>
<v Speaker 4>phone calls and was saying happy new</v>

1461
01:03:19.111 --> 01:03:21.630
<v Speaker 4>year to people during the show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>during the show.</v>

1462
01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:24.240
<v Speaker 4>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this stupid fucking bitch was making</v>

1463
01:03:24.241 --> 01:03:26.550
<v Speaker 4>phone calls while the show was going on.</v>

1464
01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:27.480
<v Speaker 2>The way I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1465
01:03:27.481 --> 01:03:31.620
<v Speaker 2>I've been behind in front of next to</v>
<v Speaker 2>that person.</v>

1466
01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:33.060
<v Speaker 2>That's a crazy thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

1467
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:34.023
<v Speaker 2>you were at</v>

1468
01:03:34.050 --> 01:03:35.640
<v Speaker 4>form,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a live performance and you're</v>

1469
01:03:35.641 --> 01:03:39.320
<v Speaker 4>calling people and talking to them or</v>
<v Speaker 4>even answering the phone and talking on</v>

1470
01:03:39.321 --> 01:03:39.700
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1471
01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:44.700
<v Speaker 2>but I think if you have signs with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>stern language saying you'll be no,</v>

1472
01:03:44.771 --> 01:03:46.210
<v Speaker 2>I was like peeing on the floor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>

1473
01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:47.380
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I gotta be honest with you,</v>

1474
01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:52.630
<v Speaker 2>I really respect my audience and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>really think that that would eliminate</v>

1475
01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:57.130
<v Speaker 2>the handful of people that would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>douchey most because I play at Largo a</v>

1476
01:03:57.140 --> 01:04:00.850
<v Speaker 2>lot and at Largo they make the</v>
<v Speaker 2>announcement and I have,</v>

1477
01:04:00.910 --> 01:04:05.860
<v Speaker 2>I have never seen anyone during my show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an exceptional place.</v>

1478
01:04:05.890 --> 01:04:06.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1479
01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:09.480
<v Speaker 2>but you can create an exceptional vibe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yes.</v>

1480
01:04:09.550 --> 01:04:11.710
<v Speaker 2>In your audience with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by respecting them.</v>

1481
01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:13.190
<v Speaker 2>I certainly agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1482
01:04:13.210 --> 01:04:14.050
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1483
01:04:14.051 --> 01:04:16.300
<v Speaker 2>when I go someplace and they want to put</v>
<v Speaker 2>a stamp on my hands,</v>

1484
01:04:16.301 --> 01:04:16.961
<v Speaker 2>I just go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1485
01:04:16.961 --> 01:04:17.211
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1486
01:04:17.211 --> 01:04:18.044
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1487
01:04:18.610 --> 01:04:20.890
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There'll be no stamps on my hands.</v>

1488
01:04:21.130 --> 01:04:22.750
<v Speaker 2>And you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the doorman usually says,</v>

1489
01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:24.790
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

1490
01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:26.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when they do not look,</v>

1491
01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:28.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't really drink alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1492
01:04:28.211 --> 01:04:30.160
<v Speaker 2>but so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like if I go to the bar and order a</v>

1493
01:04:30.161 --> 01:04:31.840
<v Speaker 2>drink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy who's going to look for my stamp</v>

1494
01:04:32.350 --> 01:04:34.000
<v Speaker 2>point being is fuck all that.</v>

1495
01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.220
<v Speaker 2>I got to have respect for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you go to like a mythical</v>

1496
01:04:36.221 --> 01:04:38.680
<v Speaker 2>festival,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like also when you go to the</v>

1497
01:04:38.681 --> 01:04:43.330
<v Speaker 2>bathroom and they have the sinks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind the sinks where it senses</v>

1498
01:04:43.331 --> 01:04:45.730
<v Speaker 2>your hand even though it doesn't always</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

1499
01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:47.140
<v Speaker 2>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those times,</v>

1500
01:04:47.170 --> 01:04:50.170
<v Speaker 2>those ones where you push down and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>get 10 seconds,</v>

1501
01:04:50.410 --> 01:04:52.750
<v Speaker 2>that's so disrespectful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's wrong,</v>

1502
01:04:53.110 --> 01:04:54.250
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>

<v Speaker 2>about those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the problems?</v>

<v Speaker 2>their hands.</v>

<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>

1552

<v Speaker 2>I have a giant issue with,</v>

1555
01:06:57.701 --> 01:07:02.701
<v Speaker 2>with that many people who in auditions</v>
<v Speaker 2>won't shake an actor's hand because</v>

1556
01:07:04.841 --> 01:07:06.070
<v Speaker 2>they've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not,</v>

<v Speaker 2>he doesn't even bang knuckles anymore.</v>

1560
01:07:12.050 --> 01:07:13.560
<v Speaker 2>He was banging knuckles for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't.</v>

1561
01:07:13.561 --> 01:07:15.940
<v Speaker 2>He even do knuckles anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's gotten worse.</v>

1562
01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:17.590
<v Speaker 2>That's his business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a good man.</v>

1563
01:07:17.710 --> 01:07:20.110
<v Speaker 2>He's a very good man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He really liked that guy a lot,</v>

1564
01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:22.060
<v Speaker 2>but I want to hug him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to go,</v>

1569
01:07:32.921 --> 01:07:36.220
<v Speaker 2>But I want him to get over that because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's insane not going to happen.</v>

1570
01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.370
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think people haven't worked with</v>

1571
01:07:38.371 --> 01:07:40.870
<v Speaker 2>them on it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense to want to</v>

<v Speaker 2>change Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

1575
01:07:47.710 --> 01:07:49.180
<v Speaker 2>And that's what the addiction with</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1576
01:07:49.181 --> 01:07:53.530
<v Speaker 2>If you don't want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody try the way when it comes to</v>

1577
01:07:53.531 --> 01:07:56.410

1578
01:07:57.010 --> 01:08:01.600

1579
01:08:01.601 --> 01:08:04.270
<v Speaker 2>all those different types of people.</v>

<v Speaker 2>trail of paper towels in his hotel room</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he never has to stay on the carpet.</v>

<v Speaker 3>with Tony Danza and it wasn't like we</v>
<v Speaker 3>were even looking at each other or we</v>

1617
01:09:30.621 --> 01:09:34.910
<v Speaker 3>had an awkward moment together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really wanted to say hello and not</v>

1618
01:09:34.911 --> 01:09:37.460
<v Speaker 3>because I'm a big Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tony fans a fan or any reason.</v>

1619
01:09:37.670 --> 01:09:42.080
<v Speaker 3>It was just the fame factor wanting me</v>
<v Speaker 3>to talk to Tony Danza course.</v>

1620
01:09:42.110 --> 01:09:43.190
<v Speaker 3>Not even like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey Tony,</v>

1621
01:09:43.191 --> 01:09:46.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm Jeff Garlin Wright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just Hey Tony Danza oh you know,</v>

1622
01:09:46.431 --> 01:09:47.264
<v Speaker 3>hey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1623
01:09:47.330 --> 01:09:49.250
<v Speaker 3>And so I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh this is fucked up.</v>

1624
01:09:49.251 --> 01:09:50.390
<v Speaker 3>Shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't say anything.</v>

1625
01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:53.090
<v Speaker 3>He seems very approachable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He seems like a very nice fella.</v>

1626
01:09:53.210 --> 01:09:54.380
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that is not,</v>

1627
01:09:54.710 --> 01:09:55.100
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1628
01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:56.750
<v Speaker 4>when I was a young man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1629
01:09:56.870 --> 01:10:00.920
<v Speaker 4>I always wished that I was as nice as</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tony Danza.</v>

1630
01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:04.790
<v Speaker 4>Cause when I see Tony Danza on taxi and</v>
<v Speaker 4>all those shows him like he always</v>

1631
01:10:04.791 --> 01:10:07.820
<v Speaker 4>seemed so friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like why can't I be nice and friendly?</v>

1632
01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:09.950
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't be weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As you got into show business,</v>

1633
01:10:09.951 --> 01:10:13.960
<v Speaker 4>you found out he was a prick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the truth is I've never seen,</v>

1634
01:10:13.961 --> 01:10:15.810
<v Speaker 4>I've never heard a bad thing ever said</v>
<v Speaker 4>about him.</v>

1635
01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:18.500
<v Speaker 4>There was a fist fight with him at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>comedy store one night.</v>

1636
01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:19.231
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1637
01:10:19.231 --> 01:10:19.740
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1638
01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:21.500
<v Speaker 4>Long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>long time ago.</v>

1639
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:26.590
<v Speaker 4>I want to say like it was before my time</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I started there in 94 so someone</v>

1640
01:10:26.751 --> 01:10:29.570
<v Speaker 4>said something stupid to him somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 4>back in the day.</v>

1641
01:10:29.571 --> 01:10:31.960
<v Speaker 4>And Tony Dan's was a professional boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1642
01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:35.960
<v Speaker 4>go really good boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He actually took a pro fight in between</v>

1643
01:10:35.961 --> 01:10:40.250
<v Speaker 4>tapings of taxi,</v>
<v Speaker 4>driver of taxi rather when he was a</v>

1644
01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:42.290
<v Speaker 4>first season in between first and second</v>
<v Speaker 4>season,</v>

1645
01:10:42.291 --> 01:10:43.610
<v Speaker 4>he was offered a few months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1647
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:46.190
<v Speaker 4>And then he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what am I doing?</v>

1648
01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:47.750
<v Speaker 4>Fucking actor now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1649
01:10:47.751 --> 01:10:50.000

<v Speaker 4>but he's,</v>

1650
01:10:50.001 --> 01:10:51.500
<v Speaker 4>somebody got mouthy with them.</v>

1651
01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:54.150
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

1652
01:10:54.151 --> 01:10:56.160
<v Speaker 3>when you see someone like that get into</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fight,</v>

1653
01:10:56.161 --> 01:10:58.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever approached him really,</v>

1654
01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:00.780
<v Speaker 3>there've been times where I felt like it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was just not worth it.</v>

1655
01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:05.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1671
01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:40.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't get into it.</v>

1672
01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:44.220
<v Speaker 3>You know what you think of me is none of</v>
<v Speaker 3>my business that includes fame.</v>

1673
01:11:44.350 --> 01:11:45.840
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So people come up and say things.</v>

1674
01:11:45.841 --> 01:11:47.880
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the right thing to say.</v>

1675
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.823
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

1676
01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:50.610
<v Speaker 3>and then you want to say to them</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes,</v>

1677
01:11:50.611 --> 01:11:53.640
<v Speaker 3>and you know this one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could you move along?</v>

1678
01:11:54.090 --> 01:11:58.560
<v Speaker 3>Because they just stay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just stay there and it's really</v>

1679
01:11:58.561 --> 01:12:00.150
<v Speaker 3>awkward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a dude at the comedy store</v>

1680
01:12:00.151 --> 01:12:04.710
<v Speaker 3>scared the hell out of me because he</v>
<v Speaker 3>told me how much I meant to him and then</v>

1681
01:12:04.711 --> 01:12:07.140
<v Speaker 3>he didn't leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he was telling me personal</v>

1682
01:12:07.141 --> 01:12:10.680
<v Speaker 3>things about him that were not the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to repeat them because I</v>

1683
01:12:10.681 --> 01:12:12.720
<v Speaker 3>don't want to let them know that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to him.</v>

1684
01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:14.430
<v Speaker 3>But he started telling me things like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh wow,</v>

1685
01:12:14.431 --> 01:12:17.420
<v Speaker 3>you're really a scary individual and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>want,</v>

1686
01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:22.350
<v Speaker 3>I never have said the words move along,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I actually moved along into an area</v>

1687
01:12:22.351 --> 01:12:25.920
<v Speaker 3>he couldn't enter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A number was behind the rope,</v>

1688
01:12:25.921 --> 01:12:27.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>buy the cars or in the bar,</v>

1689
01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:30.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the something to get away.</v>

1690
01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:31.800
<v Speaker 3>And he still tried,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1691
01:12:32.190 --> 01:12:35.040
<v Speaker 3>it was scary and people get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what bothers me?</v>

1692
01:12:35.041 --> 01:12:38.000
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you'll be in the middle of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>serious conversation with someone,</v>

1693
01:12:38.001 --> 01:12:39.540
<v Speaker 3>a tea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're telling you something like</v>

1694

<v Speaker 3>really intimate and someone to call</v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

<v Speaker 3>suicidal.</v>

1701
01:12:47.570 --> 01:12:50.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the middle of a competition thing</v>

1702
01:12:50.011 --> 01:12:52.380
<v Speaker 3>about jumping in front of a bus and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't give a fuck.</v>

1703
01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:52.921
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1704
01:12:52.921 --> 01:12:56.070
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a big bowl or wrong it just because</v>

1705
01:12:56.071 --> 01:13:00.510
<v Speaker 3>really just be respectful and kind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyone that comes up to me as respectful</v>

1706
01:13:00.511 --> 01:13:02.100
<v Speaker 3>and kind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind to,</v>

1707
01:13:02.130 --> 01:13:06.560
<v Speaker 3>anyone comes up to me as an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind to being an asshole.</v>

1708
01:13:06.570 --> 01:13:08.970
<v Speaker 3>They just don't know cause they are</v>
<v Speaker 3>either you're an asshole,</v>

1709
01:13:08.971 --> 01:13:12.240
<v Speaker 3>you're not either or you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's also taught,</v>

1710
01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:14.420
<v Speaker 3>you have a couple of drinks and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know what to say.</v>

1711
01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:17.370
<v Speaker 3>What's the number one rule with someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's,</v>

1712
01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:20.250
<v Speaker 3>who's drunk too much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but telling them that they're drunk.</v>

1713
01:13:20.670 --> 01:13:21.900
<v Speaker 3>That's good too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1714
01:13:21.901 --> 01:13:22.650
<v Speaker 3>Hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you drunk.</v>

1715
01:13:22.650 --> 01:13:23.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey man,</v>

1716
01:13:23.250 --> 01:13:25.080
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really talk to drunk people</v>

1717
01:13:25.410 --> 01:13:27.330
<v Speaker 3>drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh always.</v>

1718
01:13:27.630 --> 01:13:28.431
<v Speaker 3>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1719
01:13:28.431 --> 01:13:32.310
<v Speaker 3>it's the only goat too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no other goto in that situation</v>

1720
01:13:32.311 --> 01:13:32.990
<v Speaker 3>drive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1721
01:13:32.990 --> 01:13:33.680
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can do it.</v>

1722
01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:36.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so because whatever it does,</v>

1723
01:13:36.151 --> 01:13:41.151
<v Speaker 3>it really plows into your ego.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I just make the quickest</v>

1724
01:13:41.731 --> 01:13:43.230
<v Speaker 3>connection and get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get out.</v>

1725
01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:44.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good move.</v>

1726
01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:45.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's true.</v>

1727
01:13:45.631 --> 01:13:47.490
<v Speaker 3>But I'm appreciative when people come up</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>

1728
01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:51.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm appreciative and I treat them the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

1729
01:13:51.061 --> 01:13:53.940
<v Speaker 3>If someone I dug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially a comedian,</v>

1730
01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:58.530
<v Speaker 3>if I told them I dug them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I treat the people the way.</v>

1731
01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:03.000
<v Speaker 3>And the more the warmer and the more</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting the person is,</v>

1732
01:14:03.001 --> 01:14:05.070
<v Speaker 3>the more I give them of myself.</v>

1733
01:14:05.130 --> 01:14:07.680
<v Speaker 3>How does Larry David handle it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not bad.</v>

1734
01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:08.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1735
01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:09.713
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big fan of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1736
01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:11.870
<v Speaker 3>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You about that.</v>

1737
01:14:12.650 --> 01:14:14.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen them go through,</v>

1738
01:14:14.681 --> 01:14:17.650
<v Speaker 3>because it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw him become famous,</v>

1739
01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:20.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was on Fridays.</v>

1740
01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:23.950
<v Speaker 3>He created Seinfeld,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that still wasn't the fame that he</v>

1741
01:14:23.951 --> 01:14:25.870
<v Speaker 3>has now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I saw him through curb your</v>

1742
01:14:25.871 --> 01:14:30.871
<v Speaker 3>enthusiasm become truly iconic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's had trouble figuring out how to,</v>

1743
01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:35.620
<v Speaker 3>people want to take a picture of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1744
01:14:35.770 --> 01:14:36.700
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do I do it?</v>

1745
01:14:36.701 --> 01:14:39.520
<v Speaker 3>And it's always changing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's never an asshole.</v>

1746
01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:41.950
<v Speaker 3>It's truly one of the greatest comedy</v>
<v Speaker 3>shows of all time.</v>

1747
01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:42.900
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank you.</v>

1748
01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:46.300
<v Speaker 3>I 100% and I have to say the new season</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're about to film in October,</v>

1749
01:14:46.570 --> 01:14:51.570
<v Speaker 3>the storyline may be my favorite and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really subtle and fun.</v>

1750
01:14:52.210 --> 01:14:54.040
<v Speaker 3>It's like one of those things like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1751
01:14:54.041 --> 01:14:54.940
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1752
01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:59.560
<v Speaker 3>I think people watching it will feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're living a fantasy and after</v>

1753
01:14:59.561 --> 01:15:02.620
<v Speaker 3>the first one airs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy to come back and talk about</v>

1754
01:15:02.621 --> 01:15:03.160
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1755
01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:05.680
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that premise of where we're</v>

1756
01:15:05.681 --> 01:15:10.510
<v Speaker 3>going is delightful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love how hbo gives him sort of carte</v>

1757
01:15:10.511 --> 01:15:11.320
<v Speaker 3>blanche.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1758
01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:12.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take a couple of years off,</v>

1759
01:15:12.791 --> 01:15:14.110
<v Speaker 3>do whatever the fuck you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1760
01:15:14.410 --> 01:15:15.970
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take some pretty great.</v>

1761
01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:17.081
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for Larry,</v>

1762
01:15:17.081 --> 01:15:20.830
<v Speaker 3>it's not about the money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course it's about can I do another</v>

1763
01:15:20.831 --> 01:15:23.620
<v Speaker 3>good show?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that makes us different than most</v>

1764
01:15:23.621 --> 01:15:25.180
<v Speaker 3>shows in history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1765
01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:26.470
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1766
01:15:26.471 --> 01:15:29.680
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he only wants to do good work and enjoy</v>

1767
01:15:29.681 --> 01:15:32.930
<v Speaker 3>himself otherwise there's no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1768
01:15:32.931 --> 01:15:35.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an HBO is smart that way.</v>

1769
01:15:35.890 --> 01:15:37.720
<v Speaker 3>Their genius there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean look,</v>

1770
01:15:37.770 --> 01:15:42.770
<v Speaker 3>and you think about the show soprano's</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking game of thrones and now they</v>

1771
01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:47.020
<v Speaker 3>know how to let a show be a show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1772
01:15:47.530 --> 01:15:51.670
<v Speaker 3>from what I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they give a lot of notes on their</v>

1773
01:15:51.671 --> 01:15:54.460
<v Speaker 3>pilots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but once you become a series,</v>

1774
01:15:54.461 --> 01:15:55.630
<v Speaker 3>they kind of leave you alone.</v>

1775
01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:57.020
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1776
01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:02.040
<v Speaker 3>Whereas when you're doing a network show</v>
<v Speaker 3>or from other pay sources,</v>

1777
01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:06.250
<v Speaker 3>I've heard that the notes never stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well when I was on the radio is the</v>

1778
01:16:06.251 --> 01:16:10.000
<v Speaker 3>easiest thing to ruin with notes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drama can survive notes.</v>

1779
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:14.140
<v Speaker 3>Comedy cannot because it's like the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1780
01:16:14.141 --> 01:16:15.190
<v Speaker 3>doing comedies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1781
01:16:15.191 --> 01:16:15.631
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1782
01:16:15.631 --> 01:16:18.340
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dominoes and if you take one of</v>

1783
01:16:18.341 --> 01:16:20.360
<v Speaker 3>those and just move it a little to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>left,</v>

1784
01:16:20.361 --> 01:16:22.900
<v Speaker 3>to the right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're screwing up the whole thing.</v>

1785
01:16:22.930 --> 01:16:25.270
<v Speaker 3>That's very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I was on news radio,</v>

1786
01:16:25.271 --> 01:16:28.480
<v Speaker 3>we weren't successful and that is when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get the notes.</v>

1787
01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:31.690
<v Speaker 3>We were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so my friend Lou Morton,</v>

1788
01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:35.410
<v Speaker 3>who was one of the writers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would wear a shirt every Monday after</v>

1789
01:16:35.411 --> 01:16:37.030
<v Speaker 3>the ratings would come in with a number</v>
<v Speaker 3>on it.</v>

1790
01:16:37.031 --> 01:16:38.560
<v Speaker 3>It would take a white t shirt and write</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1791
01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:40.960
<v Speaker 3>And one day came into the number,</v>
<v Speaker 3>said 88 I go,</v>

1792
01:16:40.961 --> 01:16:42.100
<v Speaker 3>fuck dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1793
01:16:42.101 --> 01:16:42.790
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1794
01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:44.560
<v Speaker 3>we're 88th I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

1795
01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:46.330
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God damn it.</v>

1796
01:16:46.331 --> 01:16:47.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to say three years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1797
01:16:48.010 --> 01:16:49.210
<v Speaker 3>Five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five years.</v>

1798
01:16:49.350 --> 01:16:52.840
<v Speaker 3>So the point being is that was an</v>
<v Speaker 3>immensely successful show.</v>

1799
01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:56.050
<v Speaker 3>Barely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>barely made you stay on the air.</v>

1800
01:16:56.051 --> 01:16:57.460
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1801
01:16:57.461 --> 01:16:57.761
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1802
01:16:57.761 --> 01:16:59.800
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely better than being</v>

1803
01:16:59.801 --> 01:17:02.290
<v Speaker 3>canceled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the point being is that we were</v>

1804
01:17:02.291 --> 01:17:05.290
<v Speaker 3>never a hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we always got notes.</v>

1805
01:17:05.410 --> 01:17:07.720
<v Speaker 3>We're constantly getting notes like we</v>
<v Speaker 3>need a gay neighbor,</v>

1806
01:17:07.721 --> 01:17:09.440
<v Speaker 3>we need a black guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need a,</v>

1807
01:17:09.650 --> 01:17:09.980
<v Speaker 3>we need</v>

1808
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:11.060
<v Speaker 4>of this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We needed that.</v>

1809
01:17:11.061 --> 01:17:13.910
<v Speaker 4>We needed a love interest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need a fucking watch that show,</v>

1810
01:17:13.911 --> 01:17:15.680
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the gay neighbor and the Black Guy,</v>

1811
01:17:15.681 --> 01:17:17.360
<v Speaker 4>if that was the name of the show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be in.</v>

1812
01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:20.800
<v Speaker 4>That's what probably good name of</v>
<v Speaker 4>sitcoms gaining black guy was next door,</v>

1813
01:17:20.810 --> 01:17:22.160
<v Speaker 4>gay neighbor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's the problems that,</v>

1814
01:17:22.161 --> 01:17:24.320
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of sitcoms and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to name names,</v>

1815
01:17:24.321 --> 01:17:26.510
<v Speaker 4>but I watched them and I know they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

1816
01:17:26.511 --> 01:17:28.880
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very successful and I watched them and</v>

1817
01:17:28.881 --> 01:17:30.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm stunned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand it.</v>

1818
01:17:30.981 --> 01:17:32.930
<v Speaker 4>It's like they're speaking a different</v>
<v Speaker 4>language.</v>

1819
01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:35.480
<v Speaker 4>I don't get it either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1820
01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:37.460
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't watch comedy,</v>

1821
01:17:37.461 --> 01:17:39.290
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm Erica.</v>

1822
01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:42.800
<v Speaker 4>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something going on with tired</v>

1823
01:17:42.801 --> 01:17:43.634
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1824
01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:48.290
<v Speaker 3>Here's something that I noticed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is something that's recent to that.</v>

1825
01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:54.250
<v Speaker 3>Audiences now respond to what they think</v>
<v Speaker 3>is supposed to be funny.</v>

1826
01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.940
<v Speaker 3>Like real comedy fans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dug news radio,</v>

1827
01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:04.640
<v Speaker 3>like people who dug comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Doug News radio people did</v>

1828
01:18:04.641 --> 01:18:07.610
<v Speaker 3>comedy dig curb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do we have other kinds of fans too?</v>

1829
01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:12.140
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I find that comedy fans really do</v>

1830
01:18:12.141 --> 01:18:15.920
<v Speaker 3>get comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but everybody likes to say they like</v>

1831
01:18:15.921 --> 01:18:19.370
<v Speaker 3>comedy or they watch comedy and they may</v>
<v Speaker 3>not have any sense of humor.</v>

1832
01:18:19.610 --> 01:18:22.970
<v Speaker 3>So I find there was a show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you an example,</v>

1833
01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:26.390
<v Speaker 3>and this one was like the specific,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't care if I'm slamming it,</v>

1834
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:31.870
<v Speaker 3>it was the something in the girl and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>apartment b or the bitch and something</v>

1835
01:18:32.661 --> 01:18:34.220
<v Speaker 3>be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was um,</v>

1836
01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:35.870
<v Speaker 3>lead actress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very talented.</v>

1837
01:18:35.871 --> 01:18:39.560
<v Speaker 3>But I watched the show and the rhythms</v>
<v Speaker 3>were,</v>

1838
01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:41.540
<v Speaker 3>this is what comedy is.</v>

1839
01:18:41.570 --> 01:18:45.020
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't have a natural vibe to it.</v>

1840
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:47.540
<v Speaker 3>It had no reason for me to keep watching</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1841
01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:52.810
<v Speaker 3>but it was done in a style that other</v>
<v Speaker 3>shows have done since where this is how</v>

1842
01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:57.920
<v Speaker 3>comedy is done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the way we spend a line or do a</v>

1843
01:18:57.921 --> 01:19:02.921
<v Speaker 3>situation and I don't know why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it always involves a lot of that.</v>

1844
01:19:04.010 --> 01:19:08.260
<v Speaker 3>That putting the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the the spin on the ball or what's the</v>

1845
01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:09.910
<v Speaker 3>dancing in English?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1846
01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:14.630
<v Speaker 3>It has a lot to do with it because even</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you watch a lot of nickelodeon shows,</v>

1847
01:19:14.631 --> 01:19:17.000
<v Speaker 3>her Disney shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tend to do that.</v>

1848
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:21.980
<v Speaker 3>They put the spin on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's never funny enough just to have,</v>

1849
01:19:22.190 --> 01:19:24.290
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing about comedy TV,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy.</v>

1850
01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:28.190
<v Speaker 3>I think for the most part you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be enthralled with the</v>

1851
01:19:28.191 --> 01:19:30.380
<v Speaker 3>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the situation.</v>

1852
01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:34.220
<v Speaker 3>So the situation Lucy got into a</v>
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>

1853
01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:36.900
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you laughed at Lucy dealing with the</v>

1854
01:19:36.901 --> 01:19:39.350
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>

1855
01:19:39.351 --> 01:19:44.351
<v Speaker 3>I bet in the entire time lucy ran on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>rent on the air that there might've been</v>

1856
01:19:44.601 --> 01:19:48.410
<v Speaker 3>12 great jokes that she said in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>

1857
01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:51.680
<v Speaker 3>You're laughing on how she deals with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the situation.</v>

1858
01:19:51.681 --> 01:19:54.170
<v Speaker 3>Very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you look at any great comedy and</v>

1859
01:19:54.171 --> 01:19:56.810
<v Speaker 3>that's where this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Larry David dealing with a</v>

1860
01:19:56.811 --> 01:19:57.980
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1861
01:19:58.040 --> 01:19:59.870
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's um,</v>

1862
01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:01.100
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and by the way,</v>

1863
01:20:01.101 --> 01:20:03.950
<v Speaker 3>one thing Larry and I are very proud</v>
<v Speaker 3>about with curb your enthusiasm.</v>

1864
01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:06.260
<v Speaker 3>If one of us says something funny to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other one,</v>

1865
01:20:06.261 --> 01:20:08.130
<v Speaker 3>cause we improvise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we laugh.</v>

1866
01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:12.960
<v Speaker 3>So these shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see people say these lines written</v>

1867
01:20:12.961 --> 01:20:16.260
<v Speaker 3>by writers and then the audience laughs</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's on stage,</v>

1868
01:20:16.530 --> 01:20:18.570
<v Speaker 3>but yet the actors don't laugh at one</v>
<v Speaker 3>another.</v>

1869
01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:23.580
<v Speaker 3>So on a lot of levels it's just not</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1870
01:20:23.581 --> 01:20:28.510
<v Speaker 3>And then there are shows now that I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>watched for maybe five minutes where Ma</v>

1871
01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:33.120
<v Speaker 3>I cannot believe how they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how terrible they are and yet they're</v>

1872
01:20:33.121 --> 01:20:33.954
<v Speaker 3>successful.</v>

1873
01:20:34.050 --> 01:20:35.940
<v Speaker 3>Hugely successful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hugely successful.</v>

1874
01:20:35.970 --> 01:20:37.100
<v Speaker 3>Don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1875
01:20:37.290 --> 01:20:42.290
<v Speaker 3>When you guys do a show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't really have like a full script</v>

1876
01:20:42.841 --> 01:20:43.500
<v Speaker 3>in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1877
01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:46.860
<v Speaker 3>we have a very tight outline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have seven pages line.</v>

1878
01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:52.160
<v Speaker 3>Larry has written the story and in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>story maybe a half dozen things are</v>

1879
01:20:53.371 --> 01:20:56.550
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he says this or she says that you have</v>

1880
01:20:56.551 --> 01:21:00.160
<v Speaker 3>to move the story for story purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not because it's a great joke.</v>

1881
01:21:00.190 --> 01:21:02.880
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I play it every time</v>

1882
01:21:02.881 --> 01:21:07.830
<v Speaker 3>differently unless I'm told by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>director or I'm one of the producers,</v>

1883
01:21:07.831 --> 01:21:10.440
<v Speaker 3>we have a meeting of like we need to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>this across.</v>

1884
01:21:10.441 --> 01:21:12.480
<v Speaker 3>This is not coming across and I'll make</v>
<v Speaker 3>an adjustment.</v>

1885
01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:14.760
<v Speaker 3>But in general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try and do it different.</v>

1886
01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:17.970
<v Speaker 3>Every single tech that is so crazy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many takes we do,</v>

1887
01:21:18.170 --> 01:21:22.290
<v Speaker 3>well if it's Larry and I just us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he and I alone in the scene it we can,</v>

1888
01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:24.870
<v Speaker 3>we can have a scene done in less than an</v>
<v Speaker 3>hour,</v>

1889
01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:28.290
<v Speaker 3>but if there's a bunch of other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could be three hours.</v>

1890
01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:31.110
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea is just like this is what</v>

1891
01:21:31.111 --> 01:21:33.960
<v Speaker 3>needs to take place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know we have to figure out how to get</v>

1892
01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:37.590
<v Speaker 3>across the fact that the refrigerator's</v>
<v Speaker 3>broken and we're going to have to go buy</v>

1893
01:21:37.591 --> 01:21:40.710
<v Speaker 3>ice and who's going to buy the ice?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to drive to buy the ice.</v>

1894
01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:42.030
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then y'all just talking.</v>

1895
01:21:42.570 --> 01:21:45.700
<v Speaker 3>It's more in depth than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The story is really that.</v>

1896
01:21:46.170 --> 01:21:47.910
<v Speaker 3>But yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how we approach it.</v>

1897
01:21:47.911 --> 01:21:50.610
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes that can change that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the reasons why the show</v>

1898
01:21:50.611 --> 01:21:53.610
<v Speaker 3>is so good because it seems so organic</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you guys are talking.</v>

1899
01:21:53.670 --> 01:21:56.370
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's what I get out of it.</v>

1900
01:21:56.371 --> 01:21:58.470
<v Speaker 3>We don't rehearse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

1901
01:21:58.471 --> 01:22:00.150
<v Speaker 3>They are so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1902
01:22:00.210 --> 01:22:02.400
<v Speaker 3>the Goldbergs we don't even do a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>rehearsing,</v>

1903
01:22:02.401 --> 01:22:05.820
<v Speaker 3>but I have to stick to the script.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I want to improvise on the Goldbergs,</v>

1904
01:22:06.090 --> 01:22:11.090
<v Speaker 3>I have to let the producers know not to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get permission to let them know this</v>

1905
01:22:11.851 --> 01:22:14.130
<v Speaker 3>take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do something different and</v>

1906
01:22:14.131 --> 01:22:15.780
<v Speaker 3>I have to let my fellow actors know.</v>

1907
01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:17.420
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting.</v>

1908
01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:20.220
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still do adjust to go from two</v>

1909
01:22:20.221 --> 01:22:23.970
<v Speaker 3>different styles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I W I don't know that it's difficult,</v>

1910
01:22:24.270 --> 01:22:28.170
<v Speaker 3>but I find the curb your enthusiasm way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way more enjoyable.</v>

1911
01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:29.033
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

1912
01:22:29.070 --> 01:22:34.070
<v Speaker 3>But I'm really proud the Goldbergs is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the number one show on tv that families</v>

1913
01:22:34.351 --> 01:22:37.680
<v Speaker 3>watch together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm very proud of that and I get why</v>

1914
01:22:37.681 --> 01:22:40.080
<v Speaker 3>people dig it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not my style,</v>

1915
01:22:40.290 --> 01:22:43.200
<v Speaker 3>but when I watch it occasionally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't watch it very often.</v>

1916
01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:47.730
<v Speaker 3>I get why people dig it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not confused by the show.</v>

1917
01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:48.180
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1918
01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:50.340
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like these other shows we're talking</v>

1919
01:22:50.341 --> 01:22:53.700
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be confused as to why they're</v>

1920
01:22:53.701 --> 01:22:55.260
<v Speaker 3>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why they're on there.</v>

1921
01:22:55.590 --> 01:22:57.990
<v Speaker 3>But other ones I watch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I watch monitor family.</v>

1922
01:22:58.080 --> 01:22:59.970
<v Speaker 3>I get why people dig it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1923
01:22:59.971 --> 01:23:00.300
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1924
01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:03.060
<v Speaker 3>It makes total sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1925
01:23:03.061 --> 01:23:04.660
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's,</v>

1926
01:23:04.670 --> 01:23:06.100
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's</v>

1927
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:07.780
<v Speaker 2>much more enjoyable during the curb</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1928
01:23:07.781 --> 01:23:11.800
<v Speaker 2>It's edgier and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I still dig the Goldbergs and I also</v>

1929
01:23:11.801 --> 01:23:15.870
<v Speaker 2>dig the crew and I dig the people I work</v>
<v Speaker 2>with and I dig the writer.</v>

1930
01:23:15.871 --> 01:23:18.880
<v Speaker 2>So it's a very positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderful experience.</v>

1931
01:23:18.881 --> 01:23:23.290
<v Speaker 2>And I'm lucky I'm on one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>popular network comedies and among the</v>

1932
01:23:23.291 --> 01:23:26.470
<v Speaker 2>most popular alternative comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How'd you get to be so lucky?</v>

1933
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:28.360
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

1934
01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:31.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm grateful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I keep on getting told in therapy.</v>

1935
01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:33.760
<v Speaker 2>Don't say lucky so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I says,</v>

1936
01:23:33.790 --> 01:23:36.970
<v Speaker 2>why is he telling you that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because grateful because I do have</v>

1937
01:23:36.971 --> 01:23:40.240
<v Speaker 2>something to do with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not from an ego standpoint,</v>

1938
01:23:40.260 --> 01:23:42.670
<v Speaker 2>but like I've worked hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done this,</v>

1939
01:23:42.671 --> 01:23:46.030
<v Speaker 2>I've done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm just incredibly grateful.</v>

1940
01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:48.520
<v Speaker 2>You're lucky too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm lucky.</v>

1941
01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:50.650
<v Speaker 2>Grateful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

1942
01:23:50.651 --> 01:23:52.330
<v Speaker 2>what have I told you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not kidding.</v>

1943
01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:54.370
<v Speaker 2>That dude has taught me so much.</v>

1944
01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:56.560
<v Speaker 2>That might be the only thing I disagree</v>
<v Speaker 2>with him on.</v>

1945
01:23:56.770 --> 01:23:58.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't know shit.</v>

1946
01:23:58.120 --> 01:23:59.080
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lucky is good.</v>

1947
01:23:59.290 --> 01:23:59.891
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roger.</v>

1948
01:23:59.891 --> 01:24:03.420
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roger Dog Daltrey uh,</v>

1949
01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:06.940
<v Speaker 2>always said be lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's the cause that means no matter</v>

1950
01:24:06.941 --> 01:24:09.940
<v Speaker 2>how great you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter how much you have to do with</v>

1951
01:24:09.941 --> 01:24:11.440
<v Speaker 2>this or that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at it,</v>

1952
01:24:11.441 --> 01:24:13.440
<v Speaker 2>that you're lucky being hung.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

1953
01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:15.730
<v Speaker 2>being humble is a big bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>

1954
01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:18.730
<v Speaker 2>the combination of being competent and</v>
<v Speaker 2>being humble,</v>

1955
01:24:19.090 --> 01:24:21.010
<v Speaker 2>you can't beat the being aware that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1956
01:24:21.011 --> 01:24:23.230
<v Speaker 2>you could be born in Ethiopia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could have been,</v>

1957
01:24:23.450 --> 01:24:26.110
<v Speaker 2>well Lorne,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that funny in the middle of nowhere.</v>

1958
01:24:26.290 --> 01:24:26.861
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1959
01:24:26.861 --> 01:24:27.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could have been fun.</v>

1960
01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:29.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm not big on ego.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ego.</v>

1961
01:24:29.351 --> 01:24:30.850
<v Speaker 2>Ego screws me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

1962
01:24:30.851 --> 01:24:33.610
<v Speaker 2>I was ignorant enough at one time to</v>
<v Speaker 2>think I can eliminate my ego.</v>

1963
01:24:33.790 --> 01:24:36.160
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just got to recognize it when it</v>

1964
01:24:36.161 --> 01:24:39.520
<v Speaker 2>pops up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize it and keep it under control</v>

1965
01:24:39.550 --> 01:24:40.930
<v Speaker 2>and we'll just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

1966
01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:41.793
<v Speaker 2>don't need Ya.</v>

1967
01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:43.060
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1968
01:24:43.210 --> 01:24:46.990
<v Speaker 2>some not going to ask to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as I'm thinking about it am my</v>

1969
01:24:46.991 --> 01:24:49.930
<v Speaker 2>saying yes to this out of an ego move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1970
01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:51.280
<v Speaker 2>I've definitely done that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1971
01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:53.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's,</v>

1972
01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:57.130
<v Speaker 2>well one of the main reasons why</v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise so much just to try to keep my</v>

1973
01:24:57.131 --> 01:24:59.740
<v Speaker 2>body in balance in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in not in terms of like the way it</v>

1974
01:24:59.741 --> 01:25:01.600
<v Speaker 2>looks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so it doesn't get in the way.</v>

1975
01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:05.500
<v Speaker 2>And I think that a lot of your body's in</v>
<v Speaker 2>balance then that helps your mind.</v>

1976
01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:06.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that helps your soul.</v>

1977
01:25:06.850 --> 01:25:07.840
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure not.</v>

1978
01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:09.640
<v Speaker 2>It's not a vanity thing man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1979
01:25:09.770 --> 01:25:11.930
<v Speaker 2>it is too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely like looking good while,</v>

1980
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:13.030
<v Speaker 2>but it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

1981
01:25:13.031 --> 01:25:16.830
<v Speaker 2>I think that's more of a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1982
01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:19.670
<v Speaker 2>respecting yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

1983
01:25:19.690 --> 01:25:22.360
<v Speaker 2>that's a self respecting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely that,</v>

1984
01:25:22.510 --> 01:25:23.350
<v Speaker 2>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1985
01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:26.620
<v Speaker 2>how new actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is weird.</v>

1986
01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:29.470
<v Speaker 2>Why is it weird?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's not something that</v>

1987
01:25:29.471 --> 01:25:31.840
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people generally love.</v>

1988
01:25:31.841 --> 01:25:33.610
<v Speaker 2>They hate going to the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they go,</v>

1989
01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:37.390
<v Speaker 2>you feel at your best when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>exercising.</v>

1990
01:25:37.570 --> 01:25:40.600
<v Speaker 2>That is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is awesome.</v>

1991
01:25:40.930 --> 01:25:43.960
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could have that for a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just let me broward for a week.</v>

1992
01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:44.830
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1993
01:25:44.830 --> 01:25:49.830
<v Speaker 2>I'd always rather nap then do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind stand up.</v>

1994
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.310
<v Speaker 2>I liked over napping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sex over napping.</v>

1995
01:25:54.670 --> 01:25:57.570
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes eating not as much anymore.</v>

1996
01:25:57.580 --> 01:26:01.320
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't because it's not a big thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me to more so I'd say sex and,</v>

1997
01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:02.640
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1998
01:26:02.730 --> 01:26:05.060
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and stand up and spending time with my</v>

1999
01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:08.900
<v Speaker 2>boys that that takes precedence over at</v>
<v Speaker 2>my boys are 18 to 22.</v>

2000
01:26:09.290 --> 01:26:11.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm madly in love with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

2001
01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:13.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that takes precedence.</v>

2002
01:26:13.701 --> 01:26:16.140
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather be with them than nab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2003
01:26:16.190 --> 01:26:17.210
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they were little,</v>

2004
01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:19.340
<v Speaker 2>when they were little taking a nap with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

2005
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:20.240
<v Speaker 2>I was in heaven.</v>

2006
01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:21.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I knew they were good.</v>

2007
01:26:21.831 --> 01:26:22.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they'd be laying,</v>

2008
01:26:23.210 --> 01:26:26.510
<v Speaker 2>laying against me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goodnight nurse.</v>

2009
01:26:26.660 --> 01:26:28.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's uh,</v>

2010
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:30.830
<v Speaker 2>the pleasure of having children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2011
01:26:30.831 --> 01:26:34.850
<v Speaker 2>like having these people that you love</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than you could ever have imagined.</v>

2012
01:26:34.851 --> 01:26:36.740
<v Speaker 2>Loving someone more than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

2013
01:26:37.010 --> 01:26:38.840
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when someone's having a kid,</v>

2014
01:26:38.930 --> 01:26:41.030
<v Speaker 2>they're about to have a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a woman or man,</v>

2015
01:26:41.390 --> 01:26:43.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't say to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh you know,</v>

2016
01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:46.940
<v Speaker 2>because you can't explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's truly a thing that you can't</v>

2017
01:26:46.941 --> 01:26:50.180
<v Speaker 2>explain and you only sound like an idiot</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you try going,</v>

2018
01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:51.260
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what it is.</v>

2019
01:26:51.290 --> 01:26:54.800
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't tell me and to be unique to me</v>

2020
01:26:55.130 --> 01:26:59.060
<v Speaker 2>and it's so big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much bigger than I ever could have</v>

2021
01:26:59.061 --> 01:27:01.310
<v Speaker 2>imagined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a different thing than you can ever</v>

2022
01:27:01.311 --> 01:27:03.380
<v Speaker 2>imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you become a different person too.</v>

2023
01:27:03.410 --> 01:27:04.450
<v Speaker 2>There's like a litter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2024
01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:07.910
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an actual switch that seems to go off</v>

2025
01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:12.290
<v Speaker 2>and the change of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me just say something cause you know</v>

2026
01:27:12.291 --> 01:27:15.440
<v Speaker 2>people at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know people were for whatever reason,</v>

2027
01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:18.650
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't go off and they still stay</v>

2028
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:21.200
<v Speaker 2>the most important person in their own</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>

2029
01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:25.400
<v Speaker 2>That's where it's weird and it throws me</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's somebody I do not want to be</v>

2030
01:27:25.401 --> 01:27:26.570
<v Speaker 2>friends with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2031
01:27:26.571 --> 01:27:29.360
<v Speaker 2>it's so people that are bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>parents that don't like their kids.</v>

2032
01:27:30.070 --> 01:27:32.390
<v Speaker 2>It's a unfollow area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunate thing.</v>

2033
01:27:32.391 --> 01:27:34.220
<v Speaker 2>It's a big bowl of wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's such a,</v>

2034
01:27:34.221 --> 01:27:36.740
<v Speaker 2>it's so sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Painful.</v>

2035
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:38.500
<v Speaker 2>I think there's certain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

2036
01:27:38.650 --> 01:27:42.230
<v Speaker 2>there has to be levels of sociopath's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2037
01:27:42.231 --> 01:27:44.270
<v Speaker 2>There's levels of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there is,</v>

2038
01:27:44.271 --> 01:27:46.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's just me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything about that topic,</v>

2039
01:27:46.290 --> 01:27:50.810
<v Speaker 2>but must be UCC pull people with</v>
<v Speaker 2>sociopathic behavior and you just go,</v>

2040
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:51.740
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2041
01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:55.280
<v Speaker 2>well it's also the business that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>in to the business solves them.</v>

2042
01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:59.240
<v Speaker 2>Well for sure they want the ice to do a</v>
<v Speaker 2>joke about it.</v>

2043
01:27:59.241 --> 01:28:04.241
<v Speaker 2>That the problem with actors is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have this big hole in their soul</v>

2044
01:28:05.001 --> 01:28:07.130
<v Speaker 2>that they need to fill up with other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's attention.</v>

2045
01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:08.920
<v Speaker 2>And I would say not me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm different.</v>

2046
01:28:08.930 --> 01:28:10.490
<v Speaker 2>That's how I am up here with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>microphone.</v>

2047
01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:11.421
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well by the way,</v>

2048
01:28:11.421 --> 01:28:14.420
<v Speaker 2>comedians are completely different than</v>
<v Speaker 2>then for the most part.</v>

2049
01:28:14.421 --> 01:28:17.360
<v Speaker 2>Then actors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you also know that to be a great</v>

2050
01:28:17.361 --> 01:28:18.800
<v Speaker 2>actor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be dumb as a rock.</v>

2051
01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:20.930
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the only Ari's,</v>

2052
01:28:20.990 --> 01:28:22.880
<v Speaker 2>it's the only art form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me.</v>

2053
01:28:22.881 --> 01:28:24.180
<v Speaker 2>I had a little hiccup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

2054
01:28:24.181 --> 01:28:27.680
<v Speaker 2>something happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the only art form and I know plenty</v>

2055
01:28:27.950 --> 01:28:32.420
<v Speaker 2>of really intelligent actors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know some that are so talented.</v>

2056
01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:35.480
<v Speaker 2>And if I could never have a conversation</v>
<v Speaker 2>with them,</v>

2057
01:28:35.481 --> 01:28:36.291
<v Speaker 2>I'd be thrilled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2058
01:28:36.291 --> 01:28:38.570
<v Speaker 2>it'd be amazing because they're just so</v>
<v Speaker 2>dumb.</v>

2059
01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:43.190
<v Speaker 2>But when the time comes and they said</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can become that person,</v>

2060
01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:45.410
<v Speaker 2>they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can fall into that role and there's</v>

2061
01:28:45.411 --> 01:28:47.240
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something wrong with them,</v>

2062
01:28:47.241 --> 01:28:49.640
<v Speaker 2>what they could do it like Wayne</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fetterman has a bit about it,</v>

2063
01:28:50.030 --> 01:28:52.160
<v Speaker 2>you know about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you for just mentioning Wayne,</v>

2064
01:28:52.430 --> 01:28:54.010
<v Speaker 2>Wayne Fetterman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love him so much.</v>

2065
01:28:54.011 --> 01:28:56.310
<v Speaker 2>A pilot with him way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way back in the day room.</v>

2066
01:28:56.690 --> 01:28:59.030
<v Speaker 2>He's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's so funny.</v>

2067
01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:02.820
<v Speaker 2>He's a rock man and known him since I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 years old.</v>

2068
01:29:02.821 --> 01:29:04.860
<v Speaker 2>I met when I first started doing comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

2069
01:29:04.890 --> 01:29:06.690
<v Speaker 2>We're from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm from Chicago,</v>

2070
01:29:06.691 --> 01:29:09.300
<v Speaker 2>but I started comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had moved to Florida with my family,</v>

2071
01:29:09.310 --> 01:29:12.330
<v Speaker 2>south Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're from the same little town in</v>

2072
01:29:12.331 --> 01:29:15.660
<v Speaker 2>Florida called Plantation Florida</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of Fort Lauderdale.</v>

2073
01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:20.310
<v Speaker 2>We did a pilot together 20 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1998 I think it was.</v>

2074
01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:21.400
<v Speaker 2>I think that was his last one.</v>

2075
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.270
<v Speaker 2>Might be right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I love him so much.</v>

2076
01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:31.230
<v Speaker 2>He had a bit that he was doing on stage</v>
<v Speaker 2>once about actors and I grabbed him off</v>

2077
01:29:31.250 --> 01:29:32.460
<v Speaker 2>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

2078
01:29:32.490 --> 01:29:35.430
<v Speaker 2>you put it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said it like the way you said it,</v>

2079
01:29:35.431 --> 01:29:38.690
<v Speaker 2>you said it the right cause it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>also he's free,</v>

2080
01:29:38.710 --> 01:29:40.200
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you know he's,</v>

2081
01:29:40.230 --> 01:29:42.900
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have notoriety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not worried about running into</v>

2082
01:29:42.901 --> 01:29:46.470
<v Speaker 2>these people that he talks shit about</v>
<v Speaker 2>onstage so you can be free.</v>

2083
01:29:46.830 --> 01:29:47.940
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

2084
01:29:47.941 --> 01:29:50.100
<v Speaker 2>it's not normal to be able to cry on</v>
<v Speaker 2>cue.</v>

2085
01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:51.061
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

2086
01:29:51.061 --> 01:29:52.530
<v Speaker 2>you can cry on cue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yay.</v>

2087
01:29:52.590 --> 01:29:55.920
<v Speaker 2>Cause you're fucking broken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is something wrong with you?</v>

2088
01:29:57.750 --> 01:30:00.060
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's another change in the world of</v>

2089
01:30:00.090 --> 01:30:03.810
<v Speaker 2>standup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The number of people who sew and this</v>

2090
01:30:03.811 --> 01:30:07.500
<v Speaker 2>started from the comedy boom when people</v>
<v Speaker 2>were getting set comes,</v>

2091
01:30:07.980 --> 01:30:11.040
<v Speaker 2>actors saw this and they went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2092
01:30:11.310 --> 01:30:13.920
<v Speaker 2>if I do stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be discovered.</v>

2093
01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.960
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2094
01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:21.200
<v Speaker 2>so that's brought a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't truly comedians to a comedy,</v>

2095
01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:25.140
<v Speaker 2>which I can spot them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a dude,</v>

2096
01:30:25.170 --> 01:30:26.670
<v Speaker 2>he gets bought bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

2097
01:30:26.671 --> 01:30:28.440
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a dude in the laugh factory</v>

2098
01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:31.200
<v Speaker 2>who was actually funny and he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually good.</v>

2099
01:30:31.650 --> 01:30:33.240
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I don't,</v>

2100
01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:34.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a sitcom,</v>

2101
01:30:34.711 --> 01:30:36.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm quitting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by next year,</v>

2102
01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:38.990
<v Speaker 2>and he didn't and he quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2103
01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:41.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember his name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who could otherwise I'd tell you off</v>

2104
01:30:41.641 --> 01:30:42.740
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll talk to you about it.</v>

2105
01:30:43.010 --> 01:30:43.920
<v Speaker 2>Fortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2106
01:30:43.921 --> 01:30:45.840
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the point being is,</v>

2107
01:30:46.140 --> 01:30:51.140
<v Speaker 2>is that if you're really a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is so part of your DNA.</v>

2108
01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:54.300
<v Speaker 2>It is so part of who you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was like,</v>

2109
01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:56.670
<v Speaker 2>it's not who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No comedians.</v>

2110
01:30:56.790 --> 01:31:00.930
<v Speaker 2>It's part of who we are on a deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep level.</v>

2111
01:31:01.290 --> 01:31:06.290
<v Speaker 2>The Passion and caring the comedians</v>
<v Speaker 2>truly have for comedy.</v>

2112
01:31:07.410 --> 01:31:11.340
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I look at other comedians</v>
<v Speaker 2>as my brothers and sisters.</v>

2113
01:31:11.630 --> 01:31:15.300
<v Speaker 2>So if you're dealing with ego,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're dealing with a,</v>

2114
01:31:15.301 --> 01:31:17.280
<v Speaker 2>you're an actor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to get famous.</v>

2115
01:31:17.490 --> 01:31:20.520
<v Speaker 2>If you're dealing with the competition</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I got no part of you,</v>

2116
01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:25.020
<v Speaker 2>when you look at me and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeff Garlin has no choice but to be a</v>

2117
01:31:25.021 --> 01:31:27.240
<v Speaker 2>comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're thinking on the same</v>

2118
01:31:27.241 --> 01:31:29.460
<v Speaker 2>wavelength as me because I have no</v>
<v Speaker 2>choice.</v>

2119
01:31:29.461 --> 01:31:31.360
<v Speaker 2>I have to be a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2120
01:31:31.361 --> 01:31:34.260
<v Speaker 2>Some people get very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very resentful of those actors.</v>

2121
01:31:34.290 --> 01:31:36.930
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't I get resentful of him and I,</v>

2122
01:31:37.090 --> 01:31:41.160
<v Speaker 2>there's plenty of room and I remember</v>
<v Speaker 2>some famous actors trying stand up,</v>

2123
01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:43.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in anyone would try it.</v>

2124
01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:45.120
<v Speaker 2>And the eighties like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember,</v>

2125
01:31:45.121 --> 01:31:46.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well she's uh,</v>

2126
01:31:46.290 --> 01:31:48.300
<v Speaker 2>what's her name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was Sean Young.</v>

2127
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:49.021
<v Speaker 2>Is that a no?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2128
01:31:49.021 --> 01:31:49.531
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2129
01:31:49.531 --> 01:31:53.340
<v Speaker 2>She was coming into the Improv and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember she was doing standup was,</v>

2130
01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:55.320
<v Speaker 2>but hers was full of Shit.</v>

2131
01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:58.680
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was the only one there who didn't help</v>

2132
01:31:58.681 --> 01:32:00.580
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone bent over backwards.</v>

2133
01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:03.220
<v Speaker 2>But she wasn't sincere and she did it</v>
<v Speaker 2>for five minutes,</v>

2134
01:32:03.550 --> 01:32:05.980
<v Speaker 2>but they like being around a famous</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman who is beautiful,</v>

2135
01:32:06.370 --> 01:32:08.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the point being is that people</v>

2136
01:32:08.891 --> 01:32:11.020
<v Speaker 2>forgot about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone can do whatever they want,</v>

2137
01:32:11.050 --> 01:32:13.570
<v Speaker 2>but do me a favor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going down that path,</v>

2138
01:32:14.110 --> 01:32:18.760
<v Speaker 2>don't screw me with your negative shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's an interesting case.</v>

2139
01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:21.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read a whole article about her and</v>

2140
01:32:21.641 --> 01:32:23.980
<v Speaker 2>fame and her struggles with it and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2141
01:32:23.981 --> 01:32:26.320
<v Speaker 2>you got people forget she was in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>original blade runner.</v>

2142
01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:29.140
<v Speaker 2>She was a phenomenal actress and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful,</v>

2143
01:32:29.141 --> 01:32:30.360
<v Speaker 2>stunning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stunning,</v>

2144
01:32:30.490 --> 01:32:32.410
<v Speaker 2>but so good too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2145
01:32:32.411 --> 01:32:37.411
<v Speaker 2>just so a probably was a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent woman and there were flaws</v>

2146
01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:41.290
<v Speaker 2>in her life and flaws and being an</v>
<v Speaker 2>actress.</v>

2147
01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:45.130
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being in the public eye is not,</v>

2148
01:32:45.131 --> 01:32:49.240
<v Speaker 2>especially now with social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the opposite of a walk in the park.</v>

2149
01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:53.830
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am not entitled to any privacy.</v>

2150
01:32:54.070 --> 01:32:58.210
<v Speaker 2>I am not entitled to any alone moments</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm walking in a park.</v>

2151
01:32:58.270 --> 01:33:00.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that saves me to look at it that</v>

2152
01:33:00.701 --> 01:33:01.360
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2153
01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:05.530
<v Speaker 2>That I'm not entitled to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if I want to be alone,</v>

2154
01:33:05.770 --> 01:33:08.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to stay in my living room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to sit in my back yard and</v>

2155
01:33:08.711 --> 01:33:11.590
<v Speaker 2>look up at the trees and the breeze,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2156
01:33:11.591 --> 01:33:12.550
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't see the breeze,</v>

2157
01:33:12.551 --> 01:33:15.780
<v Speaker 2>but I can feel the breeze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the point being is they're there.</v>

2158
01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:20.620
<v Speaker 2>The world of any privacy for you in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>public eye gone.</v>

2159
01:33:20.830 --> 01:33:22.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know when I'm at like a</v>

2160
01:33:22.691 --> 01:33:25.720
<v Speaker 2>restaurant or the airport and the TMZ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people coming with their microphone,</v>

2161
01:33:26.050 --> 01:33:30.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't say a word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why help them sell that crap and then</v>

2162
01:33:30.671 --> 01:33:33.880
<v Speaker 2>they turn off the mic and they know this</v>
<v Speaker 2>at this point now and I'm very friendly.</v>

2163
01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:35.260
<v Speaker 2>How are you guys doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?</v>

2164
01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:39.430
<v Speaker 2>And I know some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't have the right to walk</v>

2165
01:33:39.431 --> 01:33:41.050
<v Speaker 2>through the airport without them in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>

2166
01:33:41.051 --> 01:33:44.980
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The demand of a get out of those is you</v>

2167
01:33:44.981 --> 01:33:47.830
<v Speaker 2>say something stupid and people get mad</v>
<v Speaker 2>at you like,</v>

2168
01:33:47.831 --> 01:33:51.610
<v Speaker 2>and any board,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they only thing you get out of that is</v>

2169
01:33:51.611 --> 01:33:55.240
<v Speaker 2>saying something stupid and people get</v>
<v Speaker 2>mad at you.</v>

2170
01:33:55.420 --> 01:33:57.160
<v Speaker 2>There's no winning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no time.</v>

2171
01:33:57.161 --> 01:33:59.830
<v Speaker 2>What you're going to say something to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tmz and people are going to watch it and</v>

2172
01:33:59.831 --> 01:34:02.680
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was so damaged cycle possible.</v>

2173
01:34:02.710 --> 01:34:06.520
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can blow that out of time on long</v>

2174
01:34:06.521 --> 01:34:08.680
<v Speaker 2>shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is such a long shot.</v>

2175
01:34:09.130 --> 01:34:11.140
<v Speaker 2>Specifically tmz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2176
01:34:11.170 --> 01:34:14.740
<v Speaker 2>but bordain got a shitload of death</v>
<v Speaker 2>threats when uh,</v>

2177
01:34:14.741 --> 01:34:18.610
<v Speaker 2>he was at the airport and they said if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were going to cook dinner for a</v>

2180
01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:24.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a joke.</v>

2181
01:34:24.701 --> 01:34:27.490
<v Speaker 2>He's a funny guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said something funny and uh,</v>

2182
01:34:27.550 --> 01:34:28.450
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but see that's the thing.</v>

2183
01:34:29.140 --> 01:34:30.340
<v Speaker 2>There's no winning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2184
01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:33.910
<v Speaker 2>there's no winning because by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could say that at a dinner party.</v>

2185
01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:35.650
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2186
01:34:35.670 --> 01:34:37.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if someone's offended than their</v>

2187
01:34:37.210 --> 01:34:38.043
<v Speaker 2>tool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2188
01:34:38.260 --> 01:34:39.670
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could say that by the way,</v>

2189
01:34:39.671 --> 01:34:42.910
<v Speaker 2>you could say that in a room full of 11</v>
<v Speaker 2>republicans.</v>

2190
01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:44.320
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they will laugh.</v>

2191
01:34:44.350 --> 01:34:46.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're opening yourself when you'd</v>

2192
01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:49.960
<v Speaker 2>say that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't say anything.</v>

2193
01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:52.300
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can ask me comments about things</v>

2194
01:34:52.301 --> 01:34:56.920
<v Speaker 2>that go on in the world and I know I'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>have an answer that will not get me in</v>

2195
01:34:56.930 --> 01:34:58.160
<v Speaker 2>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the case</v>

2196
01:34:58.160 --> 01:34:59.270
<v Speaker 3>today with comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2197
01:34:59.271 --> 01:35:01.730
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're opening yourself up to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>

2198
01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:03.720
<v Speaker 3>You're not just opening yourself up on</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2199
01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:08.420
<v Speaker 3>Over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I went onstage was ever in fear of</v>

2200
01:35:08.421 --> 01:35:13.421
<v Speaker 3>going down a path where I would say</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that was wildly inappropriate,</v>

2201
01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:15.530
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2202
01:35:15.530 --> 01:35:17.900
<v Speaker 3>not inappropriate for the standpoint of</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking a risk,</v>

2203
01:35:18.170 --> 01:35:22.850
<v Speaker 3>but just because my sense of humor</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't go the way to use certain words.</v>

2204
01:35:23.310 --> 01:35:27.200
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't use that word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not because I'm scared of anything.</v>

2205
01:35:27.470 --> 01:35:29.050
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

2206
01:35:29.630 --> 01:35:32.050
<v Speaker 3>so people who do that and do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2207
01:35:32.350 --> 01:35:35.120
<v Speaker 3>like Michael Richards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michael Richard.</v>

2208
01:35:35.121 --> 01:35:35.954
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pool.</v>

2209
01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:37.400
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>

2210
01:35:37.401 --> 01:35:39.170
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know when he walked off stage,</v>

2211
01:35:39.171 --> 01:35:41.990
<v Speaker 3>and I think it might've been Tom Papa</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was standing in the corner,</v>

2212
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:47.470
<v Speaker 3>he went up to him and went a weird crowd</v>
<v Speaker 3>having no idea that his life was over as</v>

2213
01:35:48.471 --> 01:35:49.304
<v Speaker 3>he knew it.</v>

2214
01:35:50.180 --> 01:35:54.350
<v Speaker 3>Because by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember being furious because certain</v>

2215
01:35:54.351 --> 01:35:58.100
<v Speaker 3>people that came down to them on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>news like the next day or two where</v>

2216
01:35:58.101 --> 01:36:02.240
<v Speaker 3>people who I had heard say worst things</v>
<v Speaker 3>in their standup and they were talking</v>

2217
01:36:02.241 --> 01:36:03.740
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were talking stuff.</v>

2218
01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:06.320
<v Speaker 3>It's like when someone's swimming in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>river of Shit,</v>

2219
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:08.270
<v Speaker 3>you don't throw shit on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

2220
01:36:08.330 --> 01:36:09.560
<v Speaker 3>Let them swim in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not going to throw shit.</v>

2223
01:36:15.201 --> 01:36:18.260
<v Speaker 3>And that's loaded with shit how I felt</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Roseanne,</v>

2224
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:20.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this Roseanne Buddy went down,</v>

2225
01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:25.460
<v Speaker 3>you need to say anything else except she</v>
<v Speaker 3>really needs some sort of help.</v>

2226
01:36:25.731 --> 01:36:27.740
<v Speaker 3>And support.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not like,</v>

2227
01:36:27.890 --> 01:36:30.230
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's a Nazi or she's a horrible person.</v>

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2229
01:36:30.681 --> 01:36:32.240
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2231
01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:37.490

<v Speaker 3>Why do I need to do art when Harvey</v>

2232

<v Speaker 3>Weinstein or any of these fuckers come</v>
<v Speaker 3>out?</v>

2233
01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:42.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a twitter account because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>also know just like Tmz,</v>

2234
01:36:43.010 --> 01:36:45.320
<v Speaker 3>how long until I say something that</v>
<v Speaker 3>pisses somebody off.</v>

2235
01:36:45.321 --> 01:36:47.930
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there are people,</v>

2236
01:36:48.290 --> 01:36:51.080
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not saying their names,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to get into a thing who</v>

2237
01:36:51.081 --> 01:36:52.730
<v Speaker 3>will come out and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gentlemen,</v>

2238
01:36:52.731 --> 01:36:55.580
<v Speaker 3>that's not the way to behave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or you know what I mean?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Do I need to say hauling a successful,</v>

2241
01:37:03.530 --> 01:37:07.670
<v Speaker 3>accomplished black woman?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something bad is bad.</v>

2242
01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:09.740
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't need my comment.</v>

2243
01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:13.430
<v Speaker 3>All these people on twitter to think</v>
<v Speaker 3>their comments necessary.</v>

2244
01:37:13.550 --> 01:37:14.870
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to add into this.</v>

2245
01:37:14.980 --> 01:37:16.910
<v Speaker 3>I need to be part of this dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2246
01:37:16.940 --> 01:37:18.080
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's virtue signaling.</v>

2247
01:37:18.450 --> 01:37:20.860
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's letting everybody know the suicide</v>

2248
01:37:20.980 --> 01:37:23.230
<v Speaker 3>and I'm on the right side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a bunch of crap.</v>

2249
01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:27.830
<v Speaker 3>But it was a want people to assume that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I making the right choice.</v>

2250
01:37:27.831 --> 01:37:30.500
<v Speaker 3>I want people to assume because they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>not going to hear what my choice.</v>

2251
01:37:30.501 --> 01:37:33.980
<v Speaker 3>So there's a guy who was a journalist</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is angry and he was saying that the</v>

2252
01:37:33.981 --> 01:37:38.981
<v Speaker 3>lack of a blow back from other comedians</v>
<v Speaker 3>about Louis C K that they weren't</v>

2253
01:37:40.131 --> 01:37:43.280
<v Speaker 3>screening and how horrible this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>speaks volumes.</v>

2254
01:37:43.610 --> 01:37:45.740
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] don't know what you're</v>

2255
01:37:45.741 --> 01:37:48.410
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what speaks volumes about this</v>

2256
01:37:48.411 --> 01:37:50.540
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't know what he's talking about,</v>

2257
01:37:50.660 --> 01:37:51.210
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>

<v Speaker 3>knowledge.</v>

2259
01:37:53.541 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 3>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should anyone be sexually forward in</v>

2260
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:57.630
<v Speaker 2>a room and a woman in an inappropriate</v>
<v Speaker 2>way?</v>

2261
01:37:57.750 --> 01:38:01.820
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I need to say that she ever yell out</v>

2262
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:05.130
<v Speaker 2>and say this is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2263
01:38:05.131 --> 01:38:06.530
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you this is then,</v>

2264
01:38:06.570 --> 01:38:07.403
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's wrong.</v>

2265
01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:09.300
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

2266
01:38:09.330 --> 01:38:13.530
<v Speaker 2>Five days of it coming out of him</v>
<v Speaker 2>admitting that he did it right though.</v>

2267
01:38:13.740 --> 01:38:15.060
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>

2268
01:38:15.130 --> 01:38:18.780
<v Speaker 2>this guy was accusing all these other</v>
<v Speaker 2>communities of being pieces of shit</v>

2269
01:38:18.781 --> 01:38:21.180
<v Speaker 2>because they are not wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not.</v>

2270
01:38:22.030 --> 01:38:25.860
<v Speaker 2>You don't need my opinion designation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2271
01:38:26.430 --> 01:38:28.500
<v Speaker 2>If someone's swimming in a river of</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

2272
01:38:29.010 --> 01:38:31.230
<v Speaker 2>I do not need to throw shit in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>river.</v>

2273
01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:33.960
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are your requirements as a person</v>

2274
01:38:33.961 --> 01:38:35.910
<v Speaker 2>when something happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's a mass shooting,</v>

2275
01:38:35.911 --> 01:38:38.370
<v Speaker 2>do I need to stand up and say that that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a bad thing,</v>

2276
01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:39.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2277
01:38:39.070 --> 01:38:39.871
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's obvious.</v>

2278
01:38:39.871 --> 01:38:40.770
<v Speaker 2>That was a bad thing.</v>

2279
01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:43.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do I need to comment on everything</v>

2280
01:38:43.021 --> 01:38:44.640
<v Speaker 2>that happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to come in and if that's the</v>

2281
01:38:44.641 --> 01:38:46.890
<v Speaker 2>case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there an action I can do to help</v>

2282
01:38:46.910 --> 01:38:49.620
<v Speaker 2>write it or was it just commenting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which does nothing.</v>

2283
01:38:49.650 --> 01:38:51.300
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

2284
01:38:51.510 --> 01:38:51.871
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

2285
01:38:51.871 --> 01:38:53.430
<v Speaker 2>You're letting us know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

2286
01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:56.940
<v Speaker 2>These certain individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm thinking of two in particular</v>

2287
01:38:56.941 --> 01:38:59.660
<v Speaker 2>who I know and like both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you do three of them?</v>

2288
01:38:59.661 --> 01:39:01.480
<v Speaker 2>Are there three of them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually one,</v>

2289
01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:03.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't know as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2290
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:08.100
<v Speaker 2>but I'll tell you afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always in these situations.</v>

2291
01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:09.840
<v Speaker 2>Say the obvious like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2292
01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:13.200
<v Speaker 2>who wouldn't believe that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I get furious.</v>

2293
01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:16.920
<v Speaker 2>Especially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them's a great old friend of mine</v>

2294
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:19.320
<v Speaker 2>and it's just a comment every time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2295
01:39:19.530 --> 01:39:21.390
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend that does the same</v>

2296
01:39:21.391 --> 01:39:22.140
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2297
01:39:22.140 --> 01:39:25.260
<v Speaker 2>who's a an accomplished stand up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always,</v>

2298

<v Speaker 2>guy away?</v>

<v Speaker 2>anything to do with women.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

2306
01:39:45.210 --> 01:39:46.350
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>

2307
01:39:46.351 --> 01:39:48.000
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that amazing though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

2308
01:39:48.180 --> 01:39:50.850
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they almost like,</v>

2309
01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:55.050
<v Speaker 2>he's like holding like when the divorce</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes like down the line,</v>

2310
01:39:55.051 --> 01:39:59.520
<v Speaker 2>which is definitely an come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like at least [inaudible] guy.</v>

2311
01:39:59.730 --> 01:40:02.310
<v Speaker 2>I will have a reverent conversations</v>
<v Speaker 2>with my friends,</v>

2312
01:40:02.430 --> 01:40:03.720
<v Speaker 2>drinking coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hanging out.</v>

2313
01:40:04.140 --> 01:40:06.360
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I'll even talk too loud in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>coffee shop.</v>

2314
01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:07.270
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's tongue and cheek,</v>

2315
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:08.080
<v Speaker 2>but fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2316
01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:09.810
<v Speaker 2>but I will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

2317
01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:11.400
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's another one.</v>

2318
01:40:11.401 --> 01:40:15.210
<v Speaker 2>You know the worst possible things you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could ever hear.</v>

2319
01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:17.940
<v Speaker 2>Comedians at the funeral,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedian dies.</v>

2320
01:40:18.750 --> 01:40:20.640
<v Speaker 2>What comedians are saying to one</v>
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

2321
01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:26.660
<v Speaker 2>It is stuff that would be unforgiven</v>
<v Speaker 2>unforgiven but it's just the way we deal</v>

2322
01:40:27.031 --> 01:40:30.750
<v Speaker 2>with grief in those situations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also the inappropriate thing at</v>

2323
01:40:30.751 --> 01:40:33.300
<v Speaker 2>that time is very funny to someone like</v>
<v Speaker 2>you or I.</v>

2324
01:40:33.820 --> 01:40:34.740
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very fun.</v>

2325
01:40:34.741 --> 01:40:39.000
<v Speaker 2>I was sitting right next to Dave Foley</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we went to the emmy's and Phil</v>

2326
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:42.750
<v Speaker 2>Hartman had just been murdered and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was nominated for an emmy and he lost to</v>

2327
01:40:42.751 --> 01:40:45.400
<v Speaker 2>this guy from frasier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2328
01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:46.830
<v Speaker 2>Dave looks over at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2329
01:40:46.831 --> 01:40:48.300
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck's the guy I have to do to</v>
<v Speaker 2>win?</v>

2330
01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:52.560
<v Speaker 2>That's a great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we were like crying,</v>

2331
01:40:52.650 --> 01:40:54.190
<v Speaker 2>sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're drinking</v>

2332
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:56.440
<v Speaker 4>and we're just so bummed out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is death.</v>

2333
01:40:56.510 --> 01:40:57.980
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then Dave says that,</v>

2334
01:40:57.981 --> 01:40:59.890
<v Speaker 4>and then he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like a total straight face.</v>

2335
01:40:59.891 --> 01:41:01.210
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck's going to have to do to</v>
<v Speaker 4>win?</v>

2336
01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.480
<v Speaker 3>That's really funny because in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>moment it was just that.</v>

2337
01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:10.170
<v Speaker 3>But we say the most inappropriate things</v>
<v Speaker 3>in tragic moments to make each other</v>

2338
01:41:10.171 --> 01:41:11.190
<v Speaker 3>laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make Jews left.</v>

2339
01:41:11.191 --> 01:41:12.810
<v Speaker 3>But I'm not going to say them on my</v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter.</v>

2340
01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:14.130
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to say them to other</v>

2341
01:41:14.131 --> 01:41:15.360
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

2342
01:41:15.450 --> 01:41:20.450
<v Speaker 3>anytime I've ever tried something sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of inside with someone not on the</v>

2343
01:41:21.961 --> 01:41:23.430
<v Speaker 3>inside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In terms of comedy,</v>

2344
01:41:24.180 --> 01:41:28.200
<v Speaker 3>it has been a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Disaster every time.</v>

2345
01:41:28.290 --> 01:41:30.960
<v Speaker 3>How about you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking to even privately like like</v>

2346
01:41:30.961 --> 01:41:34.680
<v Speaker 3>with at a party or something or what</v>
<v Speaker 3>about with your kids,</v>

2347
01:41:34.980 --> 01:41:36.480
<v Speaker 3>parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your kids,</v>

2348
01:41:36.481 --> 01:41:37.530
<v Speaker 3>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>parents.</v>

2349
01:41:37.570 --> 01:41:42.150
<v Speaker 3>The way the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the biggest fights with my wife,</v>

2350
01:41:42.330 --> 01:41:46.170
<v Speaker 3>I look back over the years are when we</v>
<v Speaker 3>either went to the principal,</v>

2351
01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:49.430
<v Speaker 3>we went to have the meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went to the open house.</v>

2352
01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:53.910
<v Speaker 3>Something I said I never left there</v>
<v Speaker 3>unscathed.</v>

2353
01:41:54.260 --> 01:41:59.260
<v Speaker 3>The only one that you couldn't get that</v>
<v Speaker 3>mad at me for was I convinced our tour</v>

2354
01:42:00.001 --> 01:42:02.400
<v Speaker 3>of a school that the building was</v>
<v Speaker 3>haunted.</v>

2355
01:42:03.030 --> 01:42:06.900
<v Speaker 3>That was the only time where she went.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was kind of funny.</v>

2356
01:42:07.140 --> 01:42:09.930
<v Speaker 3>But you freaked everybody out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including the school officials.</v>

2357
01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:12.210
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>inappropriate.</v>

2358
01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:15.630
<v Speaker 3>You're inappropriate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeff Garlin you're my big bowl of</v>

2359
01:42:15.631 --> 01:42:17.680
<v Speaker 3>inappropriate half but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2360
01:42:17.730 --> 01:42:19.650
<v Speaker 3>but it's sort of how we get through</v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

2361
01:42:19.710 --> 01:42:24.710
<v Speaker 3>We meaning comedians and and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the thing is we're wired alike.</v>

2362
01:42:25.021 --> 01:42:26.550
<v Speaker 3>We are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we share,</v>

2363
01:42:26.790 --> 01:42:31.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to say DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we share something where a brother</v>

2364
01:42:31.381 --> 01:42:35.340
<v Speaker 3>and sister had worked together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I remember coming off stage,</v>

2365
01:42:35.550 --> 01:42:39.480
<v Speaker 3>this is like a classic one coming off</v>
<v Speaker 3>stage of caroline's doing a benefit and</v>

2366
01:42:39.481 --> 01:42:41.180
<v Speaker 3>they're not coming after waiting to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>onstage.</v>

2367
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:44.490
<v Speaker 3>Cohen's Onstage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Colin Quinn and he's fucking eating it</v>

2368
01:42:44.910 --> 01:42:46.770
<v Speaker 3>and I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this crowd sucks.</v>

2369
01:42:46.771 --> 01:42:49.110
<v Speaker 3>Fuck them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to go do my best.</v>

2370
01:42:49.111 --> 01:42:52.740
<v Speaker 3>It's a benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some guy comes up to me and he says,</v>

2371
01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:54.000
<v Speaker 3>I can't wait to go up.</v>

2372
01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:54.571
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thanks.</v>

2373
01:42:54.571 --> 01:42:56.070
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy again,</v>

2374
01:42:56.100 --> 01:42:57.930
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just know you're talking about my</v>

2375
01:42:57.931 --> 01:43:00.900
<v Speaker 3>brother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My brother is standing up there doing</v>

2376
01:43:00.901 --> 01:43:03.750
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not complimenting me if you're</v>

2377
01:43:03.751 --> 01:43:05.820
<v Speaker 3>fucking with my brother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I told them.</v>

2378
01:43:06.150 --> 01:43:07.570
<v Speaker 3>Because it's the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2379
01:43:07.860 --> 01:43:10.470
<v Speaker 3>We are together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We experienced something.</v>

2380
01:43:10.710 --> 01:43:14.430
<v Speaker 3>But that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a uniqueness and a specialist</v>

2381
01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:19.470
<v Speaker 3>and not everybody is part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody is an actor trying not,</v>

2382
01:43:19.471 --> 01:43:22.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean a lot of people were actors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot people are any cause their ego,</v>

2383
01:43:22.620 --> 01:43:24.700
<v Speaker 3>their singing voice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it wasn't good enough.</v>

2384
01:43:24.701 --> 01:43:25.890
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2385
01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:29.850
<v Speaker 3>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that I have problems with</v>

2386
01:43:30.270 --> 01:43:35.270
<v Speaker 3>almost never are true comedians yet to</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it's the brother,</v>

2387
01:43:35.461 --> 01:43:37.020
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like we're really,</v>

2388
01:43:37.290 --> 01:43:38.760
<v Speaker 3>when we're together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2389
01:43:39.090 --> 01:43:41.460
<v Speaker 3>it's almost never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always ego people.</v>

2390
01:43:41.610 --> 01:43:45.150
<v Speaker 3>And it's always people that are doing it</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the wrong reasons.</v>

2391
01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:48.000
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not me sitting in judgment.</v>

2392
01:43:48.270 --> 01:43:52.130
<v Speaker 3>It's me getting what they give me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>

2393
01:43:52.131 --> 01:43:54.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't have conflicts with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I let them,</v>

2394
01:43:54.550 --> 01:43:56.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's something I learned a long time</v>

2395
01:43:56.361 --> 01:43:58.610
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's ego to put my shit on them.</v>

2396
01:43:58.611 --> 01:43:59.300
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2397
01:43:59.300 --> 01:44:02.480
<v Speaker 3>But I drive home feeling sad so I avoid</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing,</v>

2398
01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:04.450
<v Speaker 3>I've learned to not have conflicts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Took,</v>

2399
01:44:04.540 --> 01:44:05.373
<v Speaker 3>took a while.</v>

2400
01:44:06.090 --> 01:44:07.430
<v Speaker 4>I would disagree with something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be like,</v>

2401
01:44:07.431 --> 01:44:09.950
<v Speaker 4>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that fuck you doesn't get anywhere.</v>

2402
01:44:09.980 --> 01:44:13.630
<v Speaker 4>It's like the same thing as like when</v>
<v Speaker 4>something happens and you complained</v>

2403
01:44:13.631 --> 01:44:14.410
<v Speaker 4>about it on twitter,</v>

2404
01:44:14.410 --> 01:44:17.320
<v Speaker 3>but I am not chasing Jane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's talk about change.</v>

2405
01:44:17.350 --> 01:44:19.420
<v Speaker 3>Did you read about that girl from</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sweden,</v>

2406
01:44:19.730 --> 01:44:20.740
<v Speaker 3>from Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe.</v>

2407
01:44:21.100 --> 01:44:24.310
<v Speaker 3>Who got on the airplane with the guy who</v>
<v Speaker 3>was both sent to Afghanistan.</v>

2408
01:44:24.311 --> 01:44:28.030
<v Speaker 3>I did read that this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have never been more,</v>

2409
01:44:28.510 --> 01:44:31.120
<v Speaker 3>I think I was being deported and would</v>
<v Speaker 3>sit down.</v>

2410
01:44:31.150 --> 01:44:33.790
<v Speaker 3>She knew when he gets back he's going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>die.</v>

2411
01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:35.440
<v Speaker 3>He's going to be murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy,</v>

2412
01:44:35.470 --> 01:44:37.060
<v Speaker 3>that was her attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the stuff,</v>

2413
01:44:37.061 --> 01:44:40.030
<v Speaker 3>cause I only read the headline of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole story.</v>

2414
01:44:40.031 --> 01:44:43.840
<v Speaker 3>So she's on the plane specifically</v>
<v Speaker 3>bought a ticket knowing that he's being</v>

2415
01:44:43.841 --> 01:44:45.210
<v Speaker 3>deported.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she did it on purpose.</v>

2416
01:44:45.211 --> 01:44:47.260
<v Speaker 3>She's an activist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's an activist,</v>

2417
01:44:47.261 --> 01:44:49.060
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know what she's done in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>past.</v>

2418
01:44:49.061 --> 01:44:54.061
<v Speaker 3>All I know is she refused to sit down</v>
<v Speaker 3>and at a certain point there was a</v>

2419
01:44:55.091 --> 01:44:57.280
<v Speaker 3>soccer team on the flight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stood up with her.</v>

2420
01:44:57.580 --> 01:44:59.770
<v Speaker 3>There were other people who said we back</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2421
01:45:00.070 --> 01:45:02.800
<v Speaker 3>But there were also a lot of pieces of</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

2422
01:45:03.190 --> 01:45:05.290
<v Speaker 3>Shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're making us late.</v>

2423
01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:10.600
<v Speaker 3>So one's going to die and look at her</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting herself on the line.</v>

2424
01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:13.990
<v Speaker 3>And then she was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as she and the guy who was being</v>

2425
01:45:13.991 --> 01:45:16.180
<v Speaker 3>deported,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're finally escorted off the plane</v>

2426
01:45:16.390 --> 01:45:20.710
<v Speaker 3>because she did her research and her</v>
<v Speaker 3>research told her that the captain can</v>

2427
01:45:20.711 --> 01:45:23.170
<v Speaker 3>have them both taken off the plane and</v>
<v Speaker 3>take off.</v>

2428
01:45:23.171 --> 01:45:23.580
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

2429
01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:26.760
<v Speaker 4>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the story was that he was being deported</v>

2430
01:45:26.761 --> 01:45:28.610
<v Speaker 4>because of ice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it was?</v>

2431
01:45:28.830 --> 01:45:29.550
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did,</v>

2432
01:45:29.550 --> 01:45:32.230
<v Speaker 4>I only read the one either in the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2433
01:45:32.250 --> 01:45:34.860
<v Speaker 4>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were deporting him and then he was</v>

2434
01:45:34.861 --> 01:45:37.200
<v Speaker 4>going to get sent back to Afghanistan</v>
<v Speaker 4>where he was going to be killed.</v>

2435
01:45:37.230 --> 01:45:40.750
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We live in a weird time when we come to</v>

2436
01:45:42.030 --> 01:45:44.940
<v Speaker 4>start our story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was reading about some woman who was</v>

2437
01:45:44.970 --> 01:45:47.370
<v Speaker 4>devastated because her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2438
01:45:47.820 --> 01:45:52.260
<v Speaker 4>her daughter in law was being deported</v>
<v Speaker 4>and choose a trump supporter and her</v>

2439
01:45:52.261 --> 01:45:54.990
<v Speaker 4>daughter in law was being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's been in the United States,</v>

2440
01:45:55.310 --> 01:45:57.270
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>her whole life and,</v>

2441
01:45:57.271 --> 01:45:59.670
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being deported and you know,</v>

2442
01:45:59.671 --> 01:46:01.090
<v Speaker 4>just couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't believe it,</v>

2443
01:46:01.230 --> 01:46:01.810
<v Speaker 4>couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2444
01:46:01.810 --> 01:46:04.980
<v Speaker 4>came over here as an infant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of thing that when you're an</v>

2445
01:46:04.981 --> 01:46:07.890
<v Speaker 4>illegal alien that no one gives a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you been here for 30 years?</v>

2446
01:46:07.891 --> 01:46:09.760
<v Speaker 4>You only been alive for 32 they don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>get it.</v>

2447
01:46:09.980 --> 01:46:13.140
<v Speaker 4>You get sent back and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a disgrace.</v>

2448
01:46:13.410 --> 01:46:14.490
<v Speaker 4>It really is a disgrace.</v>

2449
01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:15.361
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a horrible,</v>

2450
01:46:15.361 --> 01:46:17.190
<v Speaker 3>it's a horrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you like,</v>

2451
01:46:17.191 --> 01:46:19.260
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't you fucking to this young</v>

2452
01:46:19.261 --> 01:46:21.060
<v Speaker 3>girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>young girl,</v>

2453
01:46:21.550 --> 01:46:24.630
<v Speaker 3>but believing so strongly that she</v>
<v Speaker 3>bought a ticket,</v>

2454
01:46:24.990 --> 01:46:28.260
<v Speaker 3>got on the plane and then wouldn't sit</v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

2455
01:46:28.261 --> 01:46:30.990
<v Speaker 3>But what happens now though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if the guy's still gets sent back?</v>

2456
01:46:31.350 --> 01:46:32.560
<v Speaker 3>Kill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she's still,</v>

2457
01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:34.620
<v Speaker 3>she should do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had something.</v>

2458
01:46:34.621 --> 01:46:38.280
<v Speaker 3>She did something and maybe he won't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know.</v>

2459
01:46:39.180 --> 01:46:41.940
<v Speaker 3>But that's more than just her putting on</v>
<v Speaker 3>her twitter account.</v>

2460
01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:45.960
<v Speaker 3>This is not right being deported.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is someone actually doing</v>

2461
01:46:45.961 --> 01:46:49.590
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing something that doesn't injure</v>

2462
01:46:49.650 --> 01:46:53.010
<v Speaker 3>somebody else and it can inconvenience</v>
<v Speaker 3>as people,</v>

2463
01:46:53.310 --> 01:46:55.560
<v Speaker 3>but nothing more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if you had a layover though?</v>

2464
01:46:55.700 --> 01:46:57.630
<v Speaker 3>He had a big gig.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What have I had?</v>

2465
01:46:57.631 --> 01:46:58.250
<v Speaker 3>A layover?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2466
01:46:58.250 --> 01:47:00.090
<v Speaker 3>it was a huge drama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on her side.</v>

2467
01:47:00.630 --> 01:47:01.710
<v Speaker 3>I know that from the gift.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2468
01:47:01.830 --> 01:47:02.790
<v Speaker 3>Sold out crowd.</v>

2469
01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:03.780
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>

2470
01:47:03.980 --> 01:47:05.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm filming a Netflix special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2471
01:47:05.940 --> 01:47:08.100
<v Speaker 3>Are you going to film a special?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am next.</v>

2472
01:47:08.101 --> 01:47:11.280
<v Speaker 3>Next spring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you do that or I'm done with the</v>

2473
01:47:11.281 --> 01:47:14.130
<v Speaker 3>Goldbergs and curb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do a Netflix special.</v>

2474
01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:17.080
<v Speaker 3>So a year from now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially somewhere in the range in</v>

2475
01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:19.590
<v Speaker 3>the summer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>less than a year from now.</v>

2476
01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:23.430
<v Speaker 3>So when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will you change your approach where you</v>

2477
01:47:23.431 --> 01:47:26.430
<v Speaker 3>have an outline like you do on curb and</v>
<v Speaker 3>like roughly,</v>

2478
01:47:26.700 --> 01:47:28.320
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know what you're going to talk about?</v>

2479
01:47:28.350 --> 01:47:32.370
<v Speaker 3>I W I have stories and things I've been</v>
<v Speaker 3>telling on stage that have been coming</v>

2480
01:47:32.371 --> 01:47:34.830
<v Speaker 3>out of me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I will tell all those,</v>

2481
01:47:34.831 --> 01:47:35.940
<v Speaker 3>but I will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing,</v>

2482
01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:40.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three different locations here in La and</v>

2483
01:47:40.890 --> 01:47:43.260
<v Speaker 3>three different shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're going to film it here.</v>

2484
01:47:43.380 --> 01:47:45.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm filming in here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three shows.</v>

2485
01:47:45.930 --> 01:47:47.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing a big theater.</v>

2486
01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:49.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I played big theaters,</v>

2487
01:47:49.801 --> 01:47:53.820
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't help me for a special,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just the typical,</v>

2488
01:47:54.030 --> 01:47:56.450
<v Speaker 3>come out to the big applause.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do My schtick.</v>

2489
01:47:56.460 --> 01:47:57.390
<v Speaker 3>Goodnight everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

2490
01:47:57.391 --> 01:47:57.931

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2492
01:47:59.791 --> 01:48:00.550

2494
01:48:03.331 --> 01:48:05.040
<v Speaker 3>his idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2495
01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:09.990
<v Speaker 3>it's going to follow me around during</v>
<v Speaker 3>the day and then how my day comes into</v>

2496
01:48:09.991 --> 01:48:12.030
<v Speaker 3>my show that night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful.</v>

01:48:12.830 --> 01:48:16.920

<v Speaker 3>enough and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hopefully it'll be an interesting thing.</v>

2500
01:48:19.381 --> 01:48:22.110
<v Speaker 3>That's what I aspire to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make something worthwhile and</v>

2501
01:48:22.111 --> 01:48:25.050
<v Speaker 3>interesting as opposed to billing my</v>
<v Speaker 3>ego.</v>

2502
01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:26.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can we do this again?</v>
