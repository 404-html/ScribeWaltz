<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

118
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:35.723
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

119
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:36.241
<v Speaker 1>We'd have to be,</v>

120
00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:37.920
<v Speaker 1>something would have to be really wrong,</v>

121
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.170
<v Speaker 1>but there've been some fights that were really crazy.</v>

122
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.380
<v Speaker 1>I remember that Nate quarry fight where the duty was fighting from the ultimate</v>

123
00:02:43.381 --> 00:02:44.214
<v Speaker 1>fighter.</v>

124
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.670
<v Speaker 1>Goddammit,</v>

125
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.503
<v Speaker 1>I forget the,</v>

126
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.070
<v Speaker 1>forget the fellow's name,</v>

127
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.380
<v Speaker 1>but he was literally running away backwards.</v>

128
00:02:49.381 --> 00:02:50.930
<v Speaker 1>He had broken his foot or some stones.</v>

129
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Starnes thank you.</v>

130
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Literally like backpedaling.</v>

131
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.720
<v Speaker 1>And then Nate quarries starts doing some crazy thing where he puts his hand up</v>

132
00:02:57.721 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 1>in front of his face and he's just walking him like going like this.</v>

133
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.830
<v Speaker 1>He's like mocking him.</v>

134
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:02.770
<v Speaker 1>And it was fun though.</v>

135
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:05.530
<v Speaker 1>And then the dude gave them two fingers but he's just not engaging.</v>

136
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.870
<v Speaker 1>It was real weird at the end of the guy's career.</v>

137
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.531
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

138
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:09.430
<v Speaker 1>let's it's downhill from,</v>

139
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:12.120
<v Speaker 1>well Caleb went to fight in some other organizations.</v>

140
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.250
<v Speaker 1>I believe he's good friends with Tate cause they were on the same seats.</v>

141
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.110
<v Speaker 1>That was that season two season two or three Canadian feller,</v>

142
00:03:19.111 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

143
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

144
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

145
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.360
<v Speaker 1>You backpedaling and gets nothing gets Nate query.</v>

146
00:03:23.361 --> 00:03:24.071
<v Speaker 1>I liked that guy.</v>

147
00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:27.250
<v Speaker 1>But you think he was fighting t RTP doorbell for the waves backpedaling?</v>

148
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.581
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

149
00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:30.160
<v Speaker 1>I think he hurts something and I think he was like,</v>

150
00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:30.580
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

151
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.020
<v Speaker 1>these guys are not paying me enough.</v>

152
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

153
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.500
<v Speaker 1>cause I think that was his argument actually after the fact.</v>

154
00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:36.250
<v Speaker 1>They're not paying me enough.</v>

155
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.083
<v Speaker 1>How much,</v>

156
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.200
<v Speaker 1>how little he gets paid.</v>

157
00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:39.190
<v Speaker 1>She signed up for it.</v>

158
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.140
<v Speaker 1>But I think if you,</v>

159
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.180
<v Speaker 1>I think his mind was as soon as he hurt his foot or something like that,</v>

160
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.810
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

161
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:44.381
<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>

162
00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:45.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to get through these,</v>

163
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.450
<v Speaker 1>trying to get that,</v>

164
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.751
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

165
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:46.991
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

166
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:47.920
<v Speaker 1>I can't hit right now.</v>

167
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.880
<v Speaker 1>I can't move right now.</v>

168
00:03:48.881 --> 00:03:51.190
<v Speaker 1>Let me just look at your doctor bill or whatever.</v>

169
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.050
<v Speaker 1>Knowing that you look at your memory,</v>

170
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.300
<v Speaker 1>you know where your members,</v>

171
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.593
<v Speaker 1>what's up?</v>

172
00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Victor Belfor did not look like a t t v tour.</v>

173
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.500
<v Speaker 1>Definitely clean the golden snitches out.</v>

174
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.940
<v Speaker 1>Everywhere he gets to present.</v>

175
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.740
<v Speaker 1>You see the fucking odds on the fight?</v>

176
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

177
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:10.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who won the fight.</v>

178
00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:11.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't know a god damn thing,</v>

179
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:14.230
<v Speaker 1>but I know that the odds were crazy and Calvin's favorite.</v>

180
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.230
<v Speaker 1>How did it make sense to one?</v>

181
00:04:16.231 --> 00:04:17.064
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

182
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:17.951
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense.</v>

183
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:19.360
<v Speaker 1>They'll think about beat towards last fights,</v>

184
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.590
<v Speaker 1>gay guard than who?</v>

185
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Weidman before that,</v>

186
00:04:21.811 --> 00:04:23.500
<v Speaker 1>like he just hasn't looked great at all,</v>

187
00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:24.550
<v Speaker 1>especially that first round.</v>

188
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.580
<v Speaker 1>I had to fucking love Calvin at one 85 I know people will say,</v>

189
00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:28.570
<v Speaker 1>what will your Ramiro,</v>

190
00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:28.870
<v Speaker 1>Bro,</v>

191
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:29.351
<v Speaker 1>I don't see.</v>

192
00:04:29.351 --> 00:04:29.891
<v Speaker 1>I love him.</v>

193
00:04:29.891 --> 00:04:30.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't like him.</v>

194
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.050
<v Speaker 1>With the top five matchups.</v>

195
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.291
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

196
00:04:32.291 --> 00:04:33.970
<v Speaker 1>I think if he just lifts weights,</v>

197
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.840
<v Speaker 1>it just gets in,</v>

198
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:35.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

199
00:04:35.211 --> 00:04:36.280
<v Speaker 1>like serious condition.</v>

200
00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:39.880
<v Speaker 1>I do like him in 25 though in it because all his reach and everything,</v>

201
00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:40.211
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

202
00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:40.391
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

203
00:04:40.391 --> 00:04:41.860
<v Speaker 1>He looked pretty God damn good here.</v>

204
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.910
<v Speaker 1>He looked different.</v>

205
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:43.743
<v Speaker 1>He looked thick.</v>

206
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.321
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

207
00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:47.850
<v Speaker 1>Calvin's never going to look like a bodybuilder that's not as bills,</v>

208
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:48.723
<v Speaker 1>but he's got it.</v>

209
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.210
<v Speaker 1>He's got a warrior's body like that motherfucker.</v>

210
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.780
<v Speaker 1>He could go for days,</v>

211
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.300
<v Speaker 1>but then you add the muscle to your point you had muscle.</v>

212
00:04:55.301 --> 00:04:56.410
<v Speaker 1>Then what you have veto.</v>

213
00:04:56.411 --> 00:04:57.460
<v Speaker 1>It looks so different.</v>

214
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.400
<v Speaker 1>Peter has that straight up dad TRT bond,</v>

215
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.580
<v Speaker 1>like got off of it and then just straight dad.</v>

216
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.571
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

217
00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:05.680
<v Speaker 1>he still looks scary,</v>

218
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.720
<v Speaker 1>but nothing like the Rockhold.</v>

219
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.510
<v Speaker 1>Vituro hold for me.</v>

220
00:05:10.511 --> 00:05:12.850
<v Speaker 1>Top three scariest fighters of all time.</v>

221
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.070
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about right there.</v>

222
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.030
<v Speaker 1>There he is.</v>

223
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.220
<v Speaker 1>Look how God Damn Jackie was.</v>

224
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.650
<v Speaker 1>Quick spinning wheel kicks and Shit.</v>

225
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.290
<v Speaker 1>Remember we're maybe beat the brakes off Anthony Johnson.</v>

226
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:24.183
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

227
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.150
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

228
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.730
<v Speaker 1>Look at that dog jack.</v>

229
00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.740
<v Speaker 1>He is when he threw that wheel because it's shoulder hold everything.</v>

230
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.100
<v Speaker 1>His abs have muscles that you wish she was still like that.</v>

231
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:34.061
<v Speaker 1>Pardon me?</v>

232
00:05:34.061 --> 00:05:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Does,</v>

233
00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.901
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

234
00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:35.350
<v Speaker 1>me too.</v>

235
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.000
<v Speaker 1>You can go to rise him now.</v>

236
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.130
<v Speaker 1>He's no,</v>

237
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.600
<v Speaker 1>he can easily go to rise and to get paid and do that and yeah,</v>

238
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.530
<v Speaker 1>TRT.</v>

239
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.550
<v Speaker 1>We'll look at what truck up cro cop went over there could hook up still doing</v>

240
00:05:48.551 --> 00:05:48.910
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

241
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.670
<v Speaker 1>You just got to wonder how many of this before I was like 20 years.</v>

242
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:52.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

243
00:05:52.151 --> 00:05:54.280
<v Speaker 1>he's 20 years.</v>

244
00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:57.010
<v Speaker 1>But I think these guys on TRT,</v>

245
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.370
<v Speaker 1>they can compete</v>

246
00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.330
<v Speaker 2>way longer than that.</v>

247
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.280
<v Speaker 2>Even if you let [inaudible] take whatever the fuck he wants and let them go over</v>

248
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:05.060
<v Speaker 2>to Japan.</v>

249
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.271
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

250
00:06:05.271 --> 00:06:06.650
<v Speaker 2>he's spinning wheel kick in.</v>

251
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:09.860
<v Speaker 2>Bitches face off against 60 he's going to be doing some crazy shit.</v>

252
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:11.150
<v Speaker 2>But here's the question.</v>

253
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.420
<v Speaker 2>What he would he be as aggressive?</v>

254
00:06:14.421 --> 00:06:15.980
<v Speaker 2>He was fighting another dude on TRT.</v>

255
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

256
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.630
<v Speaker 2>You think so?</v>

257
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:18.740
<v Speaker 2>Just think about back in the day,</v>

258
00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:23.450
<v Speaker 2>think about when he fought Vandelay handling motherfuckers were juice monkeys.</v>

259
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.200
<v Speaker 2>Literally.</v>

260
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.370
<v Speaker 2>He was so aggressive.</v>

261
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:26.030
<v Speaker 2>Remember?</v>

262
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:26.751
<v Speaker 2>No technique,</v>

263
00:06:26.751 --> 00:06:29.000
<v Speaker 2>just the lense bodybuilder,</v>

264
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.440
<v Speaker 2>straight punch like this.</v>

265
00:06:30.441 --> 00:06:32.510
<v Speaker 2>We caught him with a straight left and he was wearing shoes.</v>

266
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

267
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:33.170
<v Speaker 2>Fight.</v>

268
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.003
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

269
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:35.300
<v Speaker 2>Wearing wrestling shoes.</v>

270
00:06:35.301 --> 00:06:36.710
<v Speaker 2>Brazilian on Brazilian crime.</v>

271
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:42.100
<v Speaker 2>Freisan sticks around and they become like as powerful as pride was and there,</v>

272
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:43.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

273
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.290
<v Speaker 2>they just don't disappear like a bunch of other shows.</v>

274
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:51.130
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be an outlet and a very big outlet for people to retire from</v>

275
00:06:52.581 --> 00:06:55.550
<v Speaker 2>the UFC and get back on TRT.</v>

276
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:56.413
<v Speaker 2>Like a master's.</v>

277

285
00:07:07.341 --> 00:07:07.551

287
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:09.891
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

291
00:07:11.421 --> 00:07:14.840
<v Speaker 2>they've got some new innovative way they think to uh,</v>

292
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.700
<v Speaker 2>diminish the amount of weight guys cut.</v>

293
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:18.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly how they're doing it,</v>

294
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.630

<v Speaker 2>Put the headsets on.</v>

333
00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:29.720
<v Speaker 2>This is a good fight.</v>

334
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:31.730
<v Speaker 2>The first fight.</v>

335
00:08:31.731 --> 00:08:32.421
<v Speaker 2>A lot of shit.</v>

336
00:08:32.421 --> 00:08:32.990
<v Speaker 2>First fight.</v>

337
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:36.640
<v Speaker 2>Of course they did well the first fight Tim means hit him with an illegal need</v>

338
00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:38.150
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of us were unsure of.</v>

339
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:39.800
<v Speaker 2>I fucked that one up too.</v>

340
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.340
<v Speaker 2>I usually go on these all the time.</v>

341
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.730
<v Speaker 2>See Cause he's got one knee on the ground,</v>

342
00:08:43.731 --> 00:08:45.140
<v Speaker 2>two hands up and we're like,</v>

343
00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:45.770
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

344
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:46.603
<v Speaker 2>And here's the thing.</v>

345
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:48.710
<v Speaker 2>All he had on the ground was a knee.</v>

346
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.630
<v Speaker 2>He actually had even lifted his other leg up and he didn't even have his foot on</v>

347
00:08:53.631 --> 00:08:54.464
<v Speaker 2>the ground.</v>

348
00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:55.381
<v Speaker 2>So it was like,</v>

349
00:08:55.381 --> 00:08:55.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

350
00:08:55.561 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 2>there was that whole</v>

351
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.040
<v Speaker 3>thing of points of contact to say you'd have to have at least three points of</v>

352
00:08:59.041 --> 00:08:59.730
<v Speaker 3>contact.</v>

353
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.220
<v Speaker 3>He actually only had one point of contact,</v>

354
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:05.040
<v Speaker 3>but if it's not the bottom of your foot,</v>

355
00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:05.874
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't count.</v>

356
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.470
<v Speaker 3>So that's where it was so confusing.</v>

357
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.540
<v Speaker 3>Confusing that even mark Ratner,</v>

358
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:13.740
<v Speaker 3>when we went to him in the fight for clarification on the rules,</v>

359
00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:14.670
<v Speaker 3>he said it was legal.</v>

360
00:09:14.671 --> 00:09:17.640
<v Speaker 3>He said it was illegal knee and then big John McCarthy pulls me over and he</v>

361
00:09:17.641 --> 00:09:17.791
<v Speaker 3>goes,</v>

362
00:09:17.791 --> 00:09:18.511
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

363
00:09:18.511 --> 00:09:18.751
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

364
00:09:18.751 --> 00:09:20.010
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking illegal.</v>

365
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:20.221
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

366
00:09:20.221 --> 00:09:20.521
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

367
00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:21.354
<v Speaker 3>it is illegal.</v>

368
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:21.751
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

369
00:09:21.751 --> 00:09:23.850
<v Speaker 3>so it's when you say points of contact,</v>

370
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.130
<v Speaker 3>like if it's only just a knee,</v>

371
00:09:26.131 --> 00:09:29.340
<v Speaker 3>if only the knees on the ground and the foot's not even on the ground and the</v>

372
00:09:29.341 --> 00:09:30.450
<v Speaker 3>other foot's off the ground,</v>

373
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.050
<v Speaker 3>that's an,</v>

374
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:32.160
<v Speaker 3>that's a down opponent.</v>

375
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:32.821
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

376
00:09:32.821 --> 00:09:33.210
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

377
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.470
<v Speaker 3>anything but the soles of the feet,</v>

378
00:09:34.471 --> 00:09:35.304
<v Speaker 3>that's what it should say.</v>

379
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.540
<v Speaker 3>Anything but the soles of the feet.</v>

380
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.800
<v Speaker 3>So my thought was,</v>

381
00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:38.131
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

382
00:09:38.131 --> 00:09:40.560
<v Speaker 3>what if some guy shoots a power double on you,</v>

383
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:41.460
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

384
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.160
<v Speaker 3>And his knees on the ground as he sliding in,</v>

385
00:09:44.161 --> 00:09:48.440
<v Speaker 3>which it often is and you fucking knee him to oblivion as he's moving into that</v>

386
00:09:48.441 --> 00:09:48.990
<v Speaker 3>position.</v>

387
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:49.771
<v Speaker 3>So it doesn't count,</v>

388
00:09:49.771 --> 00:09:50.070
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

389
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:50.760
<v Speaker 3>does it?</v>

390
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.190
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

391
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:52.023
<v Speaker 3>Same Way.</v>

392
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.480
<v Speaker 3>But that's not really a transition.</v>

393
00:09:54.481 --> 00:09:57.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the guy making his approach and you're countering his approach and</v>

394
00:09:57.301 --> 00:09:58.350
<v Speaker 3>he has a down opponent.</v>

395
00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.940
<v Speaker 3>He's got a knee on the ground.</v>

396
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.590
<v Speaker 3>He's sliding towards you.</v>

397
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.160
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a doubt opponent,</v>

398
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.950
<v Speaker 3>but we will not be the same like with a,</v>

399
00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.090
<v Speaker 3>with a wheel kick lifetime,</v>

400
00:10:06.091 --> 00:10:08.220
<v Speaker 3>it's behind the ear buds in transition.</v>

401
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:08.970
<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>

402
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:09.890
<v Speaker 3>that's a creepy one.</v>

403
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.730
<v Speaker 3>I think it's different but similar.</v>

404
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.690
<v Speaker 3>Very similar that we talks about that a million times because it's like it's the</v>

405
00:10:15.691 --> 00:10:16.500
<v Speaker 3>best position to be.</v>

406
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.610
<v Speaker 3>If you get the guys back,</v>

407
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.050
<v Speaker 3>you see a wheel kit coming,</v>

408
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.340
<v Speaker 3>you want to turn your head right,</v>

409
00:10:20.341 --> 00:10:22.020
<v Speaker 3>you want to turn your face and it's like,</v>

410
00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:22.170
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

411
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:23.610
<v Speaker 3>You mentioned during your face,</v>

412
00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:24.421
<v Speaker 3>listen man,</v>

413
00:10:24.421 --> 00:10:27.720
<v Speaker 3>there's no good place to take a wheel kick ever except the body.</v>

414
00:10:27.721 --> 00:10:28.410
<v Speaker 3>Like if you,</v>

415
00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:31.770
<v Speaker 3>I would rather take one in the arm or on the body live.</v>

416
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:31.981
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

417
00:10:31.981 --> 00:10:32.760
<v Speaker 3>it's horrible.</v>

418
00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:33.271
<v Speaker 3>It's horrible.</v>

419
00:10:33.271 --> 00:10:33.660
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

420
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.280
<v Speaker 3>it's a bone breaker for sure.</v>

421
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:35.791
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

422
00:10:35.791 --> 00:10:36.080
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

423
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.530
<v Speaker 3>it's so crazy that you have to pat up your hands but you are allowed to spin and</v>

424
00:10:40.531 --> 00:10:42.110
<v Speaker 3>with all of your body weight,</v>

425
00:10:42.111 --> 00:10:46.320
<v Speaker 3>put it in your heel and and what would he would Edson Barboza did to Terry Adam</v>

426
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.870
<v Speaker 3>remember that one jumping the buses now,</v>

427
00:10:48.871 --> 00:10:50.850
<v Speaker 3>but he was never the same again after that knock out.</v>

428
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean never the same again.</v>

429
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:53.581
<v Speaker 3>Never the same again.</v>

430
00:10:53.581 --> 00:10:54.990
<v Speaker 3>Never fought at that level again.</v>

431
00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.920
<v Speaker 3>Never that grazed the top of his head bounced off his head.</v>

432
00:10:58.921 --> 00:11:00.210
<v Speaker 3>You'll see it a million times.</v>

433
00:11:00.211 --> 00:11:04.140
<v Speaker 3>It sounded like a like a melon me person that the highlight,</v>

434
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.060
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't look like it connects flush.</v>

435
00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.380
<v Speaker 3>It goes boom.</v>

436
00:11:07.381 --> 00:11:08.214
<v Speaker 3>Top of the head.</v>

437
00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.970
<v Speaker 3>Cause I remember it cause there there was these entire flights.</v>

438
00:11:11.971 --> 00:11:12.990
<v Speaker 3>I kept on that and I was like,</v>

439
00:11:12.991 --> 00:11:13.580
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

440
00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:17.280
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't look like it was a fucking straight up heel to the grill.</v>

441
00:11:17.281 --> 00:11:18.420
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to see it again.</v>

442
00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:22.290
<v Speaker 3>But the amount of power that you have in all of your body weight,</v>

443
00:11:22.291 --> 00:11:26.880
<v Speaker 3>if you have a really good one and you can generate all that fucking torque and</v>

444
00:11:26.881 --> 00:11:29.880
<v Speaker 3>your leg comes up and there's so much weight behind it.</v>

445
00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:35.130
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the reasons why I stopped fighting was a knockout in 19 when I was</v>

446
00:11:35.131 --> 00:11:36.780
<v Speaker 3>19 years old in Anaheim.</v>

447
00:11:36.781 --> 00:11:40.080
<v Speaker 3>I will kick this guy in the head and he never got up and they carried him off</v>

448
00:11:40.081 --> 00:11:40.680
<v Speaker 3>the mat.</v>

449
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.780
<v Speaker 3>They had them in stretch of her half an hour and then they brought him to the</v>

450
00:11:42.781 --> 00:11:43.131
<v Speaker 3>hospital.</v>

451
00:11:43.131 --> 00:11:44.580
<v Speaker 3>It scared the shit out of me.</v>

452
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.380
<v Speaker 3>My heels sore,</v>

453
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.220
<v Speaker 3>my heel,</v>

454
00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.053
<v Speaker 3>my heel,</v>

455
00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:49.500
<v Speaker 3>my fucking heel.</v>

456
00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:53.100
<v Speaker 3>The hard part from his face was sore for days,</v>

457
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:53.861
<v Speaker 3>like two days.</v>

458
00:11:53.861 --> 00:11:54.040
<v Speaker 3>I was</v>

459
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.550
<v Speaker 1>walking with a little limp do.</v>

460
00:11:55.551 --> 00:11:58.240
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about that last night when when Steven's got knocked up by</v>

461
00:11:58.241 --> 00:12:01.510
<v Speaker 1>Lemieux and he just laying there and there's a stretcher,</v>

462
00:12:01.511 --> 00:12:03.910
<v Speaker 1>there's like five minutes go by and you'd see them breathe in.</v>

463
00:12:03.911 --> 00:12:04.840
<v Speaker 1>Amex Hellman goes,</v>

464
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.421
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

465
00:12:05.421 --> 00:12:07.570
<v Speaker 1>at least he's breathing and then his mom,</v>

466
00:12:07.571 --> 00:12:08.700
<v Speaker 1>his cage silo,</v>

467
00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:10.140
<v Speaker 1>all the fun out of the knocked out.</v>

468
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:10.481
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

469
00:12:10.481 --> 00:12:10.911
<v Speaker 1>Oh hell yeah,</v>

470
00:12:10.911 --> 00:12:11.181
<v Speaker 1>I love you.</v>

471
00:12:11.181 --> 00:12:11.381
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

472
00:12:11.381 --> 00:12:13.420
<v Speaker 1>what kind of knock out a box and left hook there?</v>

473
00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Exchange left hooks and no,</v>

474
00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:18.100
<v Speaker 1>no Stevenson.</v>

475
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:19.511
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

476
00:12:19.511 --> 00:12:22.900
<v Speaker 1>but when he's out on the ground and I was thinking myself,</v>

477
00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:24.370
<v Speaker 1>what's the protocol?</v>

478
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:26.230
<v Speaker 1>So these being rushed to the hospital,</v>

479
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:26.721
<v Speaker 1>what are they?</v>

480
00:12:26.721 --> 00:12:28.300
<v Speaker 1>They're looking for brain bleeding there.</v>

481
00:12:28.301 --> 00:12:30.490
<v Speaker 1>I guess the guys out more than four minutes.</v>

482
00:12:30.491 --> 00:12:31.324
<v Speaker 1>You're in trouble.</v>

483
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.200
<v Speaker 1>A lot of trucks they,</v>

484
00:12:32.201 --> 00:12:32.531
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

485
00:12:32.531 --> 00:12:35.860
<v Speaker 1>they mean they have to have really experienced guys who've dealt with those</v>

486
00:12:35.861 --> 00:12:39.640
<v Speaker 1>kinds of traumatic brain injuries on site to get it and handle it.</v>

487
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

488
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:42.700
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the real issues with those smaller shows where people that want to</v>

489
00:12:42.701 --> 00:12:43.534
<v Speaker 1>do smokers,</v>

490
00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:44.790
<v Speaker 1>if you're doing a smoker,</v>

491
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.870
<v Speaker 1>someone could easily get head kicked with a smoker,</v>

492
00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:47.920
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

493
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.540
<v Speaker 1>we'll kicks your legal and a smoker.</v>

494
00:12:49.541 --> 00:12:50.590
<v Speaker 1>So think about that.</v>

495
00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.110
<v Speaker 1>Think about everybody's wearing those patterns shinning in staffs,</v>

496
00:12:53.111 --> 00:12:54.580
<v Speaker 1>but you're not padding up your heel.</v>

497
00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:54.941
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

498
00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:58.000
<v Speaker 1>if someone decides to spin on you and they catch you in the side of the head,</v>

499
00:12:58.270 --> 00:12:59.850
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter if you're wearing headgear,</v>

500
00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:00.431
<v Speaker 1>let so many,</v>

501
00:13:00.431 --> 00:13:01.480
<v Speaker 1>we'll kick you in the head.</v>

502
00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:06.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like getting hit by it like a tree like is so fucking big to get an a</v>

503
00:13:06.761 --> 00:13:08.200
<v Speaker 1>baseball bat to your face.</v>

504
00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:11.620
<v Speaker 1>Who you want by your bedside is a Dr. Davidson.</v>

505
00:13:11.621 --> 00:13:12.400
<v Speaker 1>There it is right here.</v>

506
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:12.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

507
00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:13.481
<v Speaker 1>Doctor Davidson's.</v>

508
00:13:13.481 --> 00:13:15.860
<v Speaker 1>Amazing what says to Davidson for the UFC.</v>

509
00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>

510
00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

511
00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:17.733
<v Speaker 1>what's this though?</v>

512
00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.780
<v Speaker 1>And and fast motion.</v>

513
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:21.070
<v Speaker 1>The sound is horrible.</v>

514
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:21.851
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

515
00:13:21.851 --> 00:13:25.810
<v Speaker 1>What does Alfac left and then falls into this thing and he's like that for the</v>

516
00:13:25.811 --> 00:13:27.190
<v Speaker 1>next four or five minutes.</v>

517
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:28.703
<v Speaker 1>Oh</v>

518
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.000
<v Speaker 1>my God.</v>

519
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:31.391
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

520
00:13:31.391 --> 00:13:31.781
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

521
00:13:31.781 --> 00:13:32.051
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>

522
00:13:32.051 --> 00:13:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Here.</v>

523
00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.970
<v Speaker 1>Exchange of hooks look such a perfect chance</v>

524
00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:39.670
<v Speaker 1>to talk about a power puncher.</v>

525
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:40.391
<v Speaker 1>Both these boys,</v>

526
00:13:40.391 --> 00:13:42.160
<v Speaker 1>what a perfectly landed punch</v>

527
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:50.030
<v Speaker 1>your Marilyn Lemieux got dismantled by triple g two which is so impressive in</v>

528
00:13:50.261 --> 00:13:52.690
<v Speaker 1>fast motion and you're like [inaudible] get dismantled.</v>

529
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.100
<v Speaker 1>You got the shit beat out of him.</v>

530
00:13:54.101 --> 00:13:57.820
<v Speaker 1>But he took that fight into deeper water than a lot of people expected.</v>

531
00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:02.080
<v Speaker 1>A tough guy triple g through 50 something jabbed in the first round because he</v>

532
00:14:02.081 --> 00:14:03.010
<v Speaker 1>thought he was going to bang with them.</v>

533
00:14:03.011 --> 00:14:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Triple g you see his jab like Oh my God is he can,</v>

534
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.200
<v Speaker 1>he gets fucking bought like the loom.</v>

535
00:14:08.201 --> 00:14:10.180
<v Speaker 1>You didn't really have a chance the whole time.</v>

536
00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:13.090
<v Speaker 1>He definitely didn't have a chance but he definitely landed some shots.</v>

537
00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:16.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean he definitely tested triple g more than anybody had in recent fights</v>

538
00:14:16.241 --> 00:14:18.130
<v Speaker 1>before that Lmu fan man too.</v>

539
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.300
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe cal Brooks tested him a little bit too before triple g got to him.</v>

540
00:14:22.301 --> 00:14:23.410
<v Speaker 1>But his corner was like,</v>

541
00:14:23.411 --> 00:14:25.120
<v Speaker 1>throw the towel and as soon as it looks sketchy,</v>

542
00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.370
<v Speaker 1>they did the right move to,</v>

543
00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:30.070
<v Speaker 1>he's not to get the fuck up but couldn't see out of his eyes.</v>

544
00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:30.731
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

545
00:14:30.731 --> 00:14:30.971
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

546
00:14:30.971 --> 00:14:31.804
<v Speaker 1>good enough.</v>

547
00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:33.013
<v Speaker 1>Good job bro.</v>

548
00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.330
<v Speaker 1>Fuck this.</v>

549
00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:34.991
<v Speaker 1>Good for them.</v>

550
00:14:34.991 --> 00:14:37.800
<v Speaker 1>And who is that guy that um,</v>

551
00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.630
<v Speaker 1>fought Loma Chenko and pulled out way early.</v>

552
00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:40.961
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

553
00:14:40.961 --> 00:14:42.310
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about the Jamaican fellow,</v>

554
00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:43.813
<v Speaker 1>but he was like,</v>

555
00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.090
<v Speaker 1>I think it's 32 and then they're like,</v>

556
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.470
<v Speaker 1>he's never going to live this down.</v>

557
00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.080
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't getting his ass whooped.</v>

558
00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:50.890
<v Speaker 1>He was just like,</v>

559
00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:51.700
<v Speaker 1>I can't beat a little bit.</v>

560
00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.150
<v Speaker 1>I realize he was so outclassed.</v>

561
00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:54.980
<v Speaker 1>Well that's so much fun to watch.</v>

562
00:14:54.981 --> 00:14:56.180
<v Speaker 1>Amazing what the,</v>

563
00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:58.010
<v Speaker 1>what the guy said in the post fight interview.</v>

564
00:14:58.011 --> 00:14:58.370
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

565
00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:59.520
<v Speaker 1>I saw where this was going</v>

566
00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:02.840
<v Speaker 1>to live to fight another day.</v>

567
00:15:02.841 --> 00:15:03.531
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

568
00:15:03.531 --> 00:15:05.020
<v Speaker 1>That's smart fighter.</v>

569
00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:06.320
<v Speaker 1>Kevin says to him,</v>

570
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:10.130
<v Speaker 1>don't you think you know a lot of people usually we envy those that go out on</v>

571
00:15:10.131 --> 00:15:10.791
<v Speaker 1>their shield.</v>

572
00:15:10.791 --> 00:15:11.031
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

573
00:15:11.031 --> 00:15:11.211
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

574
00:15:11.211 --> 00:15:12.190
<v Speaker 1>I get that now.</v>

575
00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:12.380
<v Speaker 1>Look.</v>

576
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:13.310
<v Speaker 1>Lemme Chenko though.</v>

577
00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:14.643
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

578
00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:16.510
<v Speaker 1>to get the shit kicked out.</v>

579
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:19.610
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of times where guys moving around fine.</v>

580
00:15:19.611 --> 00:15:20.480
<v Speaker 1>He looks good on TV,</v>

581
00:15:20.481 --> 00:15:23.900
<v Speaker 1>but he knows in his head that he is tuned up and one shot away from going</v>

582

615
00:16:10.461 --> 00:16:11.180

616
00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.320
<v Speaker 1>he's just getting boxed up.</v>

617
00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.180
<v Speaker 1>I was thing that Jeremy Mclellan fight,</v>

618
00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:16.940
<v Speaker 1>like when Gerald went down and like took a knee,</v>

619
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.580
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't like some big punch that landed before that.</v>

620
00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.790
<v Speaker 1>It was an accumulation of all the stuff that led up to that moment.</v>

621
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.870
<v Speaker 1>And when he quit they were like kind of shocked like no.</v>

622
00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:31.190
<v Speaker 1>And then he photo the Kodo,</v>

623
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.073
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

624

627
00:16:37.011 --> 00:16:37.970
<v Speaker 1>He wrote Freddy Gone.</v>

628
00:16:37.971 --> 00:16:39.050
<v Speaker 1>You got to take them out.</v>

629
00:16:39.051 --> 00:16:42.230
<v Speaker 1>And when we spoke to Friday after,</v>

630
00:16:42.231 --> 00:16:43.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to tell him that,</v>

631
00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:43.850
<v Speaker 1>but he said,</v>

632
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:44.510
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

633
00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:47.200
<v Speaker 1>why didn't he knock him out when he could have been Friday?</v>

634
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:47.750
<v Speaker 1>Said,</v>

635
00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:49.190
<v Speaker 1>well he didn't want to hurt him.</v>

636
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.290
<v Speaker 1>That's public knowledge and is it?</v>

637
00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:51.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

638

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

640
00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.550
<v Speaker 1>Put his corner set to Miguel was like,</v>

641
00:16:55.551 --> 00:16:56.870
<v Speaker 1>if we don't see any improvement,</v>

642
00:16:56.871 --> 00:16:57.710
<v Speaker 1>we're going to stop it here.</v>

643
00:16:57.711 --> 00:16:58.800
<v Speaker 1>This is getting bad at math.</v>

644
00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:00.480
<v Speaker 1>And then Manny just didn't want to hurt him.</v>

645
00:17:00.481 --> 00:17:00.681
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

646
00:17:00.681 --> 00:17:01.311
<v Speaker 1>I could have knocked him out.</v>

647
00:17:01.311 --> 00:17:02.144
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to hurt him.</v>

648
00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

652
00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:09.530
<v Speaker 1>So weird that he's so nice and yet such a killer right now it's really,</v>

653
00:17:09.531 --> 00:17:12.320
<v Speaker 1>he's a really odd world champion.</v>

654
00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.600
<v Speaker 1>He really is in their hands because of stuff going on.</v>

655
00:17:14.601 --> 00:17:19.250
<v Speaker 1>My hair was wild as fuck and then he found Jesus was trying to get up and he's</v>

656
00:17:19.251 --> 00:17:20.210
<v Speaker 1>doing a pretty good job.</v>

657
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:22.850
<v Speaker 1>Where is his means?</v>

658
00:17:22.851 --> 00:17:24.410
<v Speaker 1>High Level Jujitsu obviously.</v>

659
00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Means is full rounded guy.</v>

661
00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:30.620
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the best guys at one 70 he's just like a sh a hair under some of the</v>

662
00:17:30.621 --> 00:17:31.700
<v Speaker 1>other top guys.</v>

663
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:32.900
<v Speaker 1>Great at anything.</v>

664
00:17:32.901 --> 00:17:34.430
<v Speaker 1>He's just that he's good at everything.</v>

665
00:17:34.431 --> 00:17:35.330
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to watch.</v>

666
00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.380
<v Speaker 1>He's great at elbows.</v>

667
00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.590
<v Speaker 1>That motherfucker's got some nasty elbows,</v>

668
00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:39.201
<v Speaker 1>good elbows.</v>

669
00:17:39.201 --> 00:17:42.860
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say he's not like top five in the division.</v>

670
00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:43.641
<v Speaker 1>No elbows.</v>

671
00:17:43.641 --> 00:17:44.474
<v Speaker 1>I think he is.</v>

672
00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:45.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying got five overall.</v>

673
00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.230
<v Speaker 1>He might have the best elbows in the 170 pound division.</v>

674
00:17:48.231 --> 00:17:49.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm not bullshitting as aggressive sounding.</v>

675
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:50.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you his elbows,</v>

676
00:17:50.911 --> 00:17:52.950
<v Speaker 1>especially in the standup positions are nasty.</v>

677
00:17:52.951 --> 00:17:54.330
<v Speaker 1>He throws him real crisp.</v>

678
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.160
<v Speaker 1>He throws him in type positions.</v>

679
00:17:56.161 --> 00:17:58.260
<v Speaker 1>Everything is like real efficient.</v>

680
00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.510
<v Speaker 1>It's all done with like real solid technique.</v>

681
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:03.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's better fighters than him currently.</v>

682
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:03.751
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

683
00:18:03.751 --> 00:18:05.580
<v Speaker 1>there's guys that have a full complete game.</v>

684
00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:06.480
<v Speaker 1>This guys like,</v>

685
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:06.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

686
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.300
<v Speaker 1>beasts like Tyron Woodley or like Damien Maia,</v>

687
00:18:09.301 --> 00:18:10.081
<v Speaker 1>he meet Damien Maia.</v>

688
00:18:10.081 --> 00:18:13.080
<v Speaker 1>It's just a Goddamn B's top 10 would be tough for him to be tough luck.</v>

689
00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:13.950
<v Speaker 1>That's close.</v>

690
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:14.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

691
00:18:14.191 --> 00:18:15.810
<v Speaker 1>All have errors all over too.</v>

692
00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Good take down.</v>

693
00:18:17.041 --> 00:18:18.660
<v Speaker 1>So you know that what happened in the first fight?</v>

694
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:24.350
<v Speaker 1>So the first fight was called a no contest because of the knee or the knee.</v>

695
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:25.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

696
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:25.891
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was called.</v>

697
00:18:25.891 --> 00:18:25.971
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

698
00:18:25.971 --> 00:18:26.820
<v Speaker 1>So confusing.</v>

699
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.300
<v Speaker 1>It was weird because they said it was an unintentional foul,</v>

700
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:32.610
<v Speaker 1>but clearly he thought it was legal.</v>

701
00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:33.990
<v Speaker 1>So was intentional.</v>

702
00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:35.690
<v Speaker 1>They call him the dirty birds.</v>

703
00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:36.643
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

704
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:40.440
<v Speaker 1>Cause we got caught by the golden snitch and I actually won three.</v>

705
00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

706
00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:43.320
<v Speaker 1>He got caught by the golden snitch with uh,</v>

707
00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:47.670
<v Speaker 1>this tiny amount of some shit that was in a supplement that he bought.</v>

708
00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:51.060
<v Speaker 1>And so they bought the supplement randomly from a store and they found the exact</v>

709
00:18:51.061 --> 00:18:51.540
<v Speaker 1>same stuff.</v>

710
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:51.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

711
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.940
<v Speaker 1>look at 10 means body and got steroids.</v>

712
00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:55.830
<v Speaker 1>Well it doesn't matter man.</v>

713
00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.610
<v Speaker 1>Instead of taking steroids and they don't really lift weights.</v>

714
00:18:59.611 --> 00:19:02.830
<v Speaker 1>They just train Jujitsu and MMA and they don't look any bigger than everything</v>

715
00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:03.290
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

716
00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:03.720
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

717
00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.291
<v Speaker 1>Steroids.</v>

718
00:19:04.291 --> 00:19:04.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

719
00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:06.480
<v Speaker 1>the real thing is the guys that lift weights,</v>

720
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:10.410
<v Speaker 1>when Lance Armstrong was taking hormones and all the shitty was taken,</v>

721
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:11.490
<v Speaker 1>he didn't look Jack.</v>

722
00:19:11.491 --> 00:19:13.650
<v Speaker 1>Just the misconception of what it thinks they're going to look like.</v>

723
00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.140
<v Speaker 1>Coping just for a to oxygenate their blood.</v>

724
00:19:16.141 --> 00:19:16.771
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of things,</v>

725
00:19:16.771 --> 00:19:16.950
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

726
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:18.810
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the tech testosterone,</v>

00:19:18.811 --> 00:19:19.471
<v Speaker 1>AIDS recovery.</v>

728
00:19:19.471 --> 00:19:21.270
<v Speaker 1>But the big thing is the only reason,</v>

729
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.810
<v Speaker 1>the only way you're getting bigger is if you're lifting weights.</v>

730
00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:24.100
<v Speaker 1>Like you're,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's what makes your body get bigger.</v>

733
00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:28.740
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to get bigger just by you.</v>

734
00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.470
<v Speaker 1>Me Get a little bit bigger just by doing kickbox and lean muscle.</v>

735
00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:33.210
<v Speaker 1>You'll look bigger.</v>

00:20:36.211 --> 00:20:37.410
<v Speaker 1>A Walk in the park.</v>

777
00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:41.070
<v Speaker 1>I saw the new King Kong movie because I'm 12.</v>

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.780
<v Speaker 1>They went full on diversity in this King Kong.</v>

788
00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:56.501
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

789
00:20:56.501 --> 00:20:57.334
<v Speaker 1>there's no rape.</v>

790
00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:59.140
<v Speaker 1>King Kong no longer steals the girl.</v>

791
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.251
<v Speaker 1>Every other movie.</v>

792
00:21:00.251 --> 00:21:01.720
<v Speaker 1>King Kong gets the girl and he's like,</v>

796
00:21:07.361 --> 00:21:09.850
<v Speaker 1>And he's so much bigger than any other King Kong in the past.</v>

797
00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:11.200
<v Speaker 1>This new King Kong,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's what I say.</v>

845
00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.800
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever have candidacies that you use it to someone?</v>

846
00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

847
00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:27.381
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:30.760
<v Speaker 1>But why did you ever wonder why?</v>

850
00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:31.630
<v Speaker 1>Why would,</v>

851
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:33.460
<v Speaker 1>why would you even want to say that to somebody?</v>

852
00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.350
<v Speaker 1>Because I want to be cool.</v>

853
00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:36.400
<v Speaker 1>The earth and everybody.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

855
00:22:36.911 --> 00:22:40.000
<v Speaker 1>But you gotta understand that if you were that cool person,</v>

856
00:22:40.001 --> 00:22:41.260
<v Speaker 1>you would not have said that.</v>

857
00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:42.561
<v Speaker 1>I know that did,</v>

858
00:22:42.561 --> 00:22:44.980
<v Speaker 1>but my fantasy is to do this.</v>

869
00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:59.680
<v Speaker 1>like a really shot action star.</v>

870
00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:00.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:23:02.141 --> 00:23:02.530
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

875
00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Adam Hunter told me he was in a fist fight with someone once and as they were</v>

876
00:23:06.101 --> 00:23:06.320
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

877
00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.740
<v Speaker 1>like getting ready to go at it.</v>

878
00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:09.280
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

879
00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:09.921
<v Speaker 1>the guy he was,</v>

880
00:23:09.921 --> 00:23:11.770
<v Speaker 1>it was a drunk dude and the dude was like,</v>

881

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:14.823
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

883
00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.600
<v Speaker 1>well that's embarrassing.</v>

884
00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:19.010
<v Speaker 1>He really did say that.</v>

885
00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:22.180
<v Speaker 1>Beat the shit out guys.</v>

886
00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:23.203
<v Speaker 1>Spar.</v>

887
00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:26.140
<v Speaker 1>Adam's a nice guy and I believe that Adam was sober at the time.</v>

888
00:23:26.141 --> 00:23:26.411
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

889
00:23:26.411 --> 00:23:28.000
<v Speaker 1>and Adam's a very good wrestler by the way.</v>

890
00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:28.271
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

891
00:23:28.271 --> 00:23:28.400
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

00:23:28.961 --> 00:23:31.390
<v Speaker 1>School wrestler wrestling at the same high school.</v>

894
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.960
<v Speaker 1>I think what he did was just took the guy down or held onto him.</v>

895
00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:34.181
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

902
00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.220

920
00:24:11.691 --> 00:24:14.720

921
00:24:14.721 --> 00:24:16.460
<v Speaker 1>lines before we fight.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This shit is,</v>

923
00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:22.400

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:15.141

968
00:25:18.711 --> 00:25:18.891
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

969
00:25:18.891 --> 00:25:21.460
<v Speaker 1>you better not fucking Pat Barry and show him too much love.</v>

970
00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:22.293
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

971
00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:23.810
<v Speaker 1>try my best.</v>

972
00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:25.280
<v Speaker 1>I'll try my best.</v>

973
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:27.170
<v Speaker 1>Sir did take it back with the trip.</v>

974
00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:28.570
<v Speaker 1>Very nice trip.</v>

975
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:31.940
<v Speaker 1>That's a big win for all of air after losing in a fucked up way.</v>

976
00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.490
<v Speaker 1>Because before he lost with that knee,</v>

977
00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:36.290
<v Speaker 1>before that the fight was stopped.</v>

978
00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.610
<v Speaker 1>He was getting tuned up.</v>

979
00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:38.983
<v Speaker 1>Huge.</v>

980
00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.140
<v Speaker 1>Everybody get out of a body triangle.</v>

981
00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.250
<v Speaker 1>How do you do the time?</v>

982
00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:45.830
<v Speaker 1>Do you lean towards the side that it's locked up on?</v>

983
00:25:45.831 --> 00:25:47.180
<v Speaker 1>It puts pressure on the ankle.</v>

984
00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:50.450
<v Speaker 1>There's ways if you have good dexterity that you can clear the leg,</v>

985
00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:51.381
<v Speaker 1>you gotta,</v>

986
00:25:51.381 --> 00:25:52.430
<v Speaker 1>you gotta know how to do it.</v>

987
00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:55.430
<v Speaker 1>You've got to know how to put your weight down and angle your hips down.</v>

988
00:25:55.431 --> 00:25:55.941
<v Speaker 1>And it takes,</v>

989
00:25:55.941 --> 00:25:56.240
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

990
00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.280
<v Speaker 1>it's a slow process to open up that triangle.</v>

991
00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:59.133
<v Speaker 1>Guys can do it,</v>

992
00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:00.470
<v Speaker 1>but when you're going to in the face,</v>

993
00:26:00.471 --> 00:26:01.400
<v Speaker 1>every time I reach for that,</v>

994
00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:04.790
<v Speaker 1>well it's the worst is when a guy who's got your belly down belly down with that</v>

995
00:26:04.791 --> 00:26:05.391
<v Speaker 1>body triangle,</v>

996
00:26:05.391 --> 00:26:06.800
<v Speaker 1>it feels like your back's gonna break.</v>

997
00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:08.180
<v Speaker 1>It's so much pressure.</v>

998
00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:10.310
<v Speaker 1>That's three in a row for a cub with,</v>

999
00:26:10.311 --> 00:26:10.760
<v Speaker 1>cause that's,</v>

1000
00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:11.660
<v Speaker 1>that's not a loss.</v>

1001
00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:12.010
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1002
00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:12.843
<v Speaker 1>the last one,</v>

1003
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.840
<v Speaker 1>that's three in a row for homeboy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's terrible.</v>

1018

<v Speaker 1>Because it's going to happen.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

1090
00:28:04.591 --> 00:28:05.700
<v Speaker 1>That would be a movie,</v>

1091
00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:06.001
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1092
00:28:06.001 --> 00:28:07.300
<v Speaker 1>That's a good movie right there.</v>

1093
00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.473
<v Speaker 1>Twist.</v>

1095
00:28:11.191 --> 00:28:14.010
<v Speaker 1>He dies like with 15 minutes left in the movie.</v>

1096
00:28:14.011 --> 00:28:15.010
<v Speaker 1>Just get you off guard.</v>

1097
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:20.080
<v Speaker 1>Subtle movie where he gets a virus and he's got a call called ne dice quiet or</v>

<v Speaker 1>he dies right away.</v>

1099
00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:25.320
<v Speaker 1>But then the rest of the movie is like going back in time.</v>

1100
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:30.600
<v Speaker 1>What do you think if they think by making King Kong this big,</v>

1101
00:28:30.601 --> 00:28:32.850
<v Speaker 1>that trying to set up a King Kong versus Godzilla movie?</v>

1102
00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:33.743
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's happening.</v>

1103
00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:36.053
<v Speaker 1>It's already happened.</v>

1104
00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:40.200
<v Speaker 1>It happened back in the either making it now.</v>

1105
00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Well then they'll throw some of the vendors in there and shit because now King</v>

1106

<v Speaker 1>Kong is as big as Godzilla.</v>

1107
00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:48.270
<v Speaker 1>Like this new King Kong is as big as gods and I don't like that.</v>

1108
00:28:48.271 --> 00:28:49.530
<v Speaker 1>Let's live a little more real.</v>

1109
00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Giant ape would have an advantage of our giant lizard because the lizard</v>

1110
00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:55.950
<v Speaker 1>basically I get got its claws.</v>

1111
00:28:55.951 --> 00:28:57.330
<v Speaker 1>But tonight as taxi breeds,</v>

1112
00:28:58.560 --> 00:28:59.540

1113
00:28:59.541 --> 00:29:03.230
<v Speaker 1>doesn't he believes he breathes fire Seabreeze fucking fire.</v>

1114
00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:03.531
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1115
00:29:03.531 --> 00:29:07.800
<v Speaker 1>you're not 33 to 2017 look at the difference between all the King Kong's.</v>

1116
00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:08.701
<v Speaker 1>See I'm a fan of that.</v>

1117
00:29:08.701 --> 00:29:09.830
<v Speaker 1>76 Kong,</v>

1118
00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:11.470
<v Speaker 1>not Kong Congress two smalls,</v>

1119
00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:15.450
<v Speaker 1>1967 that must be the Japanese version.</v>

1120
00:29:15.451 --> 00:29:15.571
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1121
00:29:15.571 --> 00:29:16.470
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm talking about.</v>

1122
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1123
00:29:16.531 --> 00:29:19.170
<v Speaker 1>So the original King Kong was only 18 feet tall.</v>

1124
00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.420
<v Speaker 1>That's not the tile.</v>

1125
00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:22.270
<v Speaker 1>So the neutral ones thick.</v>

1126
00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:25.680
<v Speaker 1>But the Kong skull island is huge.</v>

1127
00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:27.150
<v Speaker 1>He's a hundred feet tall.</v>

1128
00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:28.110
<v Speaker 1>That's bullshit.</v>

1129
00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:28.471
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1130
00:29:28.471 --> 00:29:29.280
<v Speaker 1>how big is he?</v>

1131
00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.540
<v Speaker 1>Is that skull island one?</v>

1132
00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:33.540
<v Speaker 1>So he's a hundred feet tall and Jack Black is only helpful.</v>

1133
00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:38.570
<v Speaker 1>He was 150 148 feet tall and King Kong versus Godzilla and 62 in Japan simply to</v>

1134
00:29:40.031 --> 00:29:41.650
<v Speaker 1>obey one 40 is huge,</v>

1135
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:44.380
<v Speaker 1>but isn't Godzilla 500 feet tall?</v>

1136
00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:45.573
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1137
00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:48.310
<v Speaker 1>I felt like God's really hide if he is anyway.</v>

1138
00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:53.570
<v Speaker 1>Do that guy really got Dylan movie p Diddy Cranston.</v>

1139
00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:54.311
<v Speaker 1>Pete did.</v>

1140
00:29:54.311 --> 00:29:54.730
<v Speaker 1>He was in it.</v>

1141
00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:54.851
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1142
00:29:54.851 --> 00:29:55.161
<v Speaker 1>he did.</v>

1143
00:29:55.161 --> 00:29:56.230
<v Speaker 1>He sang the theme song.</v>

1144
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:56.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1145
00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.330

1146
00:29:58.510 --> 00:29:59.500
<v Speaker 1>That's definitely not good.</v>

1147
00:29:59.530 --> 00:29:59.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1148
00:29:59.711 --> 00:30:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Look how big God's will is.</v>

1149
00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:01.481
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1150
00:30:01.481 --> 00:30:02.530
<v Speaker 1>Godzilla started off.</v>

1151
00:30:02.531 --> 00:30:03.880
<v Speaker 1>He was only 50 meters high,</v>

1152
00:30:03.881 --> 00:30:05.110
<v Speaker 1>so he's a hundred what is that?</v>

1153
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:06.490
<v Speaker 1>That's 150 feet.</v>

1154
00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:07.383
<v Speaker 1>I like my God,</v>

1155
00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:08.470
<v Speaker 1>50 meters high.</v>

1156
00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:09.493
<v Speaker 1>I thought that's what you mean.</v>

1157
00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:11.350
<v Speaker 1>But there's like a little bit more.</v>

1158
00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.280
<v Speaker 1>How do you do meters?</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's like some simple way of doing it.</v>

1163
00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:25.900
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like 50 meters is like 55 yards I think.</v>

1164
00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:30.280
<v Speaker 1>I think that's up to 14 fucking real similar.</v>

1225
00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:10.810
<v Speaker 1>People think it's bullshit.</v>

1228
00:32:12.671 --> 00:32:17.080
<v Speaker 1>what's shocking to me about it is how intricate it is when you look at all the</v>

1229
00:32:17.081 --> 00:32:19.870
<v Speaker 1>things they take into consideration when they try to like assess your</v>

1230
00:32:19.871 --> 00:32:22.540
<v Speaker 1>personality or what you are like based on your,</v>

1239
00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:39.320

1306
00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.510
<v Speaker 2>That took a long time.</v>

1307
00:33:59.550 --> 00:33:59.811
<v Speaker 2>Then he,</v>

1308
00:33:59.811 --> 00:34:00.980
<v Speaker 2>when he went over to pride,</v>

1309
00:34:00.981 --> 00:34:02.270
<v Speaker 2>he really wasn't the same guy,</v>

1310
00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:03.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1311
00:34:03.501 --> 00:34:07.610
<v Speaker 2>gross hair out had like that wet Joe curl and then it came back to the UFC and</v>

1312
00:34:07.611 --> 00:34:10.460
<v Speaker 2>had some fights where he looks sensational,</v>

1313
00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:11.323
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1314
00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:12.591
<v Speaker 2>stories like that.</v>

1315
00:34:12.591 --> 00:34:15.980
<v Speaker 2>And they ruin literally my fucking day,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1318
00:34:16.641 --> 00:34:18.760
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to know that people are capable of that.</v>

1319
00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:19.500
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:25.100
<v Speaker 2>That's happening almost every day in the Middle East.</v>

1324
00:34:25.101 --> 00:34:25.281
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1347
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:07.820
<v Speaker 2>There's something about those people that's very attractive to us.</v>

1348
00:35:07.821 --> 00:35:12.821
<v Speaker 2>When we see a Tony Soprano on TV or you see any kind of a gang kingpin type</v>

1349
00:35:13.071 --> 00:35:13.850
<v Speaker 2>character,</v>

1350
00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:17.330
<v Speaker 2>as long as you're not directly affected by his evil deeds or something that's</v>

1351
00:35:17.331 --> 00:35:18.170
<v Speaker 2>attractive about,</v>

<v Speaker 2>we'll look at narcos.</v>

1353
00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:19.731
<v Speaker 2>Narcos,</v>

1356
00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:25.110
<v Speaker 2>I feel bad for what he was going to die.</v>

1357
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:26.720
<v Speaker 2>Good Dad.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's weird man.</v>

1360
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:29.660
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird thing that he's a murderer,</v>

1361
00:35:29.661 --> 00:35:31.340
<v Speaker 2>but we like we're rooting for him.</v>

1362
00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1363
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:32.990
<v Speaker 2>Blowing up planes.</v>

1364
00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:33.681
<v Speaker 2>That's thinking about,</v>

1365
00:35:33.681 --> 00:35:33.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1366
00:35:33.891 --> 00:35:35.060
<v Speaker 2>what talent do you think?</v>

1367
00:35:35.061 --> 00:35:39.900
<v Speaker 2>Do you think a El Chapo as is bringing in more drugs into the country.</v>

1368
00:35:39.901 --> 00:35:41.190
<v Speaker 2>Then like our own government,</v>

1369
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:45.150
<v Speaker 2>our own governments doing it and we're claiming war on drugs and we're bringing</v>

1370
00:35:45.151 --> 00:35:45.600
<v Speaker 2>it in,</v>

1371
00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.400
<v Speaker 2>bringing in more than the cartels are.</v>

1372
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:47.681
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1373
00:35:47.681 --> 00:35:49.020
<v Speaker 2>they're doing it in a legal way.</v>

1374
00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:50.183
<v Speaker 2>That's why,</v>

1375
00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:52.600
<v Speaker 2>that's why the Afghanistan thing is so bizarre.</v>

1376
00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:53.910
<v Speaker 2>Not Killing families and stuff.</v>

1377
00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.780
<v Speaker 2>When you find out how much they've ramped up heroin production in Afghanistan,</v>

1378
00:35:57.781 --> 00:35:59.490
<v Speaker 2>if you don't think a few people have died for that,</v>

1379
00:35:59.491 --> 00:36:03.060
<v Speaker 2>you're crazy when bombs are being dropped on a daily basis.</v>

1380
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:03.851
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1381
00:36:03.851 --> 00:36:04.441
<v Speaker 2>that's just,</v>

1382
00:36:04.441 --> 00:36:06.180
<v Speaker 2>that's El Chapo Shit right there for you,</v>

1383
00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:07.170
<v Speaker 2>but they can hide that.</v>

1384
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:07.960
<v Speaker 2>They can hide the,</v>

1385
00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:10.020
<v Speaker 2>the Afghanistan heroin trade thing.</v>

1386
00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.790
<v Speaker 2>They can hide it right in front of everybody's face.</v>

1387
00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:13.110
<v Speaker 2>That's what's really crazy.</v>

1388
00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:15.480
<v Speaker 2>What's really crazy about the Afghan ha ha.</v>

1389
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:17.250
<v Speaker 2>It's all like the paper,</v>

1390
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.660
<v Speaker 2>like the actual paper trails.</v>

1391
00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:19.620
<v Speaker 2>Undeniable.</v>

1392
00:36:19.621 --> 00:36:20.520
<v Speaker 2>There's video of,</v>

1393
00:36:20.521 --> 00:36:21.031
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1394
00:36:21.031 --> 00:36:21.751
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who it is.</v>

1395
00:36:21.751 --> 00:36:23.870
<v Speaker 2>Maybe Geraldo Rivera.</v>

1396
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:26.040
<v Speaker 2>He's standing in front of us in the Middle East.</v>

1397
00:36:26.041 --> 00:36:29.790
<v Speaker 2>He's standing in front of a poppy plantation and there's,</v>

1398
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:32.340
<v Speaker 2>there's military guys like Guardian,</v>

1399
00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:36.870
<v Speaker 2>and they say that the guarding it because it's the weirdest excuse.</v>

1400
00:36:36.871 --> 00:36:37.101
<v Speaker 2>Everett,</v>

1401

1402
00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:40.680
<v Speaker 2>We're protecting these poppy seeds because if we don't,</v>

1403
00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:46.130
<v Speaker 2>then alcaide is going to come in and then use it and sell it to fund their</v>

1404
00:36:46.741 --> 00:36:47.371
<v Speaker 2>operations,</v>

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:51.030
<v Speaker 2>Everyone had jokes about al Capone's vault.</v>

1446
00:37:51.031 --> 00:37:52.410
<v Speaker 2>They will ask it for years.</v>

1447
00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:54.630
<v Speaker 2>Geraldo Rivera and Al Capone's vault.</v>

1448
00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:57.121
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1449
00:37:57.121 --> 00:38:02.100
<v Speaker 2>You opened it up and taken nothing but he's also the guy live from Chicago.</v>

1450
00:38:02.101 --> 00:38:02.880
<v Speaker 2>We're going to open it,</v>

1451
00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.421
<v Speaker 2>watch this.</v>

1452
00:38:03.421 --> 00:38:04.254
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

1453
00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:07.140
<v Speaker 2>They got the things falls dam and they opened it.</v>

1454
00:38:07.141 --> 00:38:07.974
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1455
00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:08.820
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1456
00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:11.160
<v Speaker 2>he took a chance with dramatic flare,</v>

1457
00:38:11.161 --> 00:38:13.890
<v Speaker 2>a chance and it didn't really pay off.</v>

1458
00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:18.690
<v Speaker 2>But if it did well now he has to kill time and share it.</v>

1459
00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:21.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's got nothing in there,</v>

1460
00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:21.780
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

1461
00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.750
<v Speaker 2>but he's also the guy that had um,</v>

1462
00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:28.790
<v Speaker 2>Dick Gregory actually on his television show debuted the Zapruder film,</v>

1463
00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 2>which is the shot of Kennedy's head getting blown off and going back into the</v>

1464
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:40.030
<v Speaker 3>left classic and in what looks like a shot from the front,</v>

1465
00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:41.680
<v Speaker 3>it looks like a frontal shot.</v>

1466
00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:45.600
<v Speaker 3>It looks like he was actually shot by more than one person if the,</v>

1467
00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:46.370
<v Speaker 3>like if you look at,</v>

1468
00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:48.850
<v Speaker 3>there's various interpretations of the Zapruder film,</v>

1469
00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:51.730
<v Speaker 3>but one interpretation that seems to make a lot of sense.</v>

1470
00:38:51.731 --> 00:38:51.931
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

1471
00:38:51.931 --> 00:38:55.240
<v Speaker 3>that he was hit from both the front and the back to he was,</v>

1472
00:38:55.241 --> 00:38:57.190
<v Speaker 3>there was multiple people shooting at them.</v>

1473
00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.830
<v Speaker 3>And if you talk to anyone who is trying to,</v>

1474
00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:01.510
<v Speaker 3>if you were looked at that pinch point,</v>

1475
00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:04.360
<v Speaker 3>like as they make that corner in Dealey Plaza,</v>

1476
00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:05.111
<v Speaker 3>like they were like,</v>

1477
00:39:05.111 --> 00:39:07.750
<v Speaker 3>well you wouldn't just have one guy with a rifle.</v>

1478
00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:09.640
<v Speaker 3>You would make sure you were shooting at them from a,</v>

1479
00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:13.320
<v Speaker 3>from a bunch of different locations and Geraldo dropped revenues and Geraldo</v>

1480
00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:14.210
<v Speaker 3>showed the video.</v>

1481
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:16.301
<v Speaker 3>Hold on a second.</v>

1482
00:39:16.301 --> 00:39:17.200
<v Speaker 3>Here's what's important.</v>

1483
00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:21.910
<v Speaker 3>That video was many years after Kennedy's assassination.</v>

1484
00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:22.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1485
00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:23.440
<v Speaker 3>like a decade.</v>

1486
00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:28.600
<v Speaker 3>So for a decade we had all thought that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone and there</v>

1487
00:39:28.601 --> 00:39:30.400
<v Speaker 3>was only a few people that didn't think he did,</v>

1488
00:39:30.401 --> 00:39:32.920
<v Speaker 3>but there was no visual evidence that showed differently.</v>

1489
00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:33.381
<v Speaker 3>Hey Lee,</v>

1490
00:39:33.381 --> 00:39:33.761
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

1491
00:39:33.761 --> 00:39:34.260
<v Speaker 3>Tell us.</v>

1492
00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:35.093
<v Speaker 3>Haji,</v>

1493
00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:36.673
<v Speaker 3>prude feminist,</v>

1494
00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:37.720
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1495
00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:40.690
<v Speaker 3>it always baffled me that when you see him get hit,</v>

1496
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:44.060
<v Speaker 3>it looks like for a couple of frames it looks like his head,</v>

1497
00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:47.590
<v Speaker 3>half his head disappears and there's just a purple Blob,</v>

1498
00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:49.480
<v Speaker 3>like it's a purple blob.</v>

1499
00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:52.000
<v Speaker 3>But then when you look at the op to autopsy pictures,</v>

1500
00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:54.910
<v Speaker 3>it's just a hole in his head and he just laying there.</v>

1501
00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:55.990
<v Speaker 3>But it looks on this,</v>

1502
00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:59.260
<v Speaker 3>it looks like it blew it all was tampered with.</v>

1503
00:39:59.290 --> 00:39:59.950
<v Speaker 3>That's what it looks.</v>

1504
00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:01.600
<v Speaker 3>Well it doesn't look like the film was tampered with,</v>

1505
00:40:01.601 --> 00:40:04.480
<v Speaker 3>but the autopsy photographs were most likely tampered with.</v>

1506
00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:08.500
<v Speaker 3>And this was a big part of the contention that David Liftin had when he wrote</v>

1507
00:40:08.501 --> 00:40:11.140
<v Speaker 3>the book best evidence because there's two different,</v>

1508
00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.090
<v Speaker 3>let's watch this.</v>

1509
00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:13.530
<v Speaker 3>We'll see like a perpetual offer.</v>

1510
00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:15.620
<v Speaker 3>Two frames doesn't make any sense.</v>

1511
00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:17.170
<v Speaker 3>Spray the bullets,</v>

1512
00:40:17.171 --> 00:40:18.004
<v Speaker 3>hitting his head,</v>

1513
00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:18.850
<v Speaker 3>his heads.</v>

1514
00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:20.110
<v Speaker 3>When you hit something with a bullet,</v>

1515
00:40:20.111 --> 00:40:20.980
<v Speaker 3>there's a spray.</v>

1516
00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:22.050
<v Speaker 3>It looks like his,</v>

1517
00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.520
<v Speaker 3>his whole face just flies off and they're just,</v>

1518
00:40:24.521 --> 00:40:24.611
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1519
00:40:24.611 --> 00:40:25.361
<v Speaker 3>they say that his,</v>

1520
00:40:25.361 --> 00:40:30.361
<v Speaker 3>his peace of his head flew off and she crawled to on the back to try to put his</v>

1521
00:40:30.491 --> 00:40:32.620
<v Speaker 3>head back to which is a human being to know.</v>

1522
00:40:32.621 --> 00:40:33.570
<v Speaker 3>She didn't know she did.</v>

1523
00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:34.760
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1524
00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:35.593
<v Speaker 3>did not say that.</v>

1525
00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.000
<v Speaker 3>That's not what happened.</v>

1526
00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:39.640
<v Speaker 3>She was trying to get the fuck out of that limousine because people were</v>

1527
00:40:39.641 --> 00:40:41.650
<v Speaker 3>shooting and they blew her husband's head off.</v>

1528
00:40:41.651 --> 00:40:43.210
<v Speaker 3>She wasn't going for any piece of meat.</v>

1529
00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:45.770
<v Speaker 3>I heard that now she was reaching,</v>

1530
00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:49.800
<v Speaker 3>people say crazy shit like that does not.</v>

1531
00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:50.890
<v Speaker 3>She was getting the fuck.</v>

1532
00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:53.410
<v Speaker 3>Did she ever talk about Barbara talked about it.</v>

1533
00:40:53.411 --> 00:40:53.571
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

1534
00:40:53.571 --> 00:40:53.831
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1535
00:40:53.831 --> 00:40:55.990
<v Speaker 3>she never talked to him for,</v>

1536
00:40:56.650 --> 00:40:57.483
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1537
00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.110
<v Speaker 3>Jackie Onassis right afterwards.</v>

1538
00:40:59.111 --> 00:41:01.300
<v Speaker 3>She married like one of the richest people she could find.</v>

1539
00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:03.140
<v Speaker 3>But don't you think with that autopsy they,</v>

1540
00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:03.480
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1541
00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.530
<v Speaker 3>it's your president that just got assassinated.</v>

1542
00:41:05.531 --> 00:41:08.010
<v Speaker 3>So you're going to want to make him look the best politics.</v>

1543
00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:09.880
<v Speaker 3>Look at the video,</v>

1544
00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:10.781
<v Speaker 3>the supporter for him.</v>

1545
00:41:10.781 --> 00:41:11.171
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

1546
00:41:11.171 --> 00:41:11.581
<v Speaker 3>Explain,</v>

1547
00:41:11.581 --> 00:41:12.610
<v Speaker 3>cause this is something that I'm really,</v>

1548
00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:17.420
<v Speaker 3>I've read different books on this shit and I've watched 10 or 15 documentaries.</v>

1549
00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:17.771
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1550
00:41:17.771 --> 00:41:17.951
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1551
00:41:17.951 --> 00:41:21.910
<v Speaker 3>one of the big things is there's a giant difference between the account of the</v>

1552
00:41:21.911 --> 00:41:22.744
<v Speaker 3>autopsy,</v>

1553
00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:23.280
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1554
00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.220
<v Speaker 3>what they said,</v>

1555
00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:28.330
<v Speaker 3>their description of the body and the wounds in Dallas versus their description</v>

1556
00:41:28.331 --> 00:41:29.410
<v Speaker 3>and the wounds in Bethesda,</v>

1557
00:41:29.411 --> 00:41:29.950
<v Speaker 3>Maryland,</v>

1558
00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:31.510
<v Speaker 3>two very different autopsies.</v>

1559
00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:36.230
<v Speaker 3>One of them that shows an entrance wound on the neck shows he got shot from the</v>

1560
00:41:36.231 --> 00:41:40.460
<v Speaker 3>front and an exit wound or an entrance wound on his neck on another one that was</v>

1561
00:41:40.461 --> 00:41:42.500
<v Speaker 3>changed to a tracheotomy scar.</v>

1562
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:44.000
<v Speaker 3>So there's a discrepancy.</v>

1563
00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:45.290
<v Speaker 3>He grabs his neck,</v>

1564
00:41:45.291 --> 00:41:46.460
<v Speaker 3>it like he got hit,</v>

1565
00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:50.010
<v Speaker 3>he holds his neck maybe a second or two before his brain's blowout.</v>

1566
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:50.600
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1567
00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:54.110
<v Speaker 3>And when he's holding his neck like this on one autopsy,</v>

1568
00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:55.670
<v Speaker 3>on one account of the body,</v>

1569
00:41:55.671 --> 00:41:57.080
<v Speaker 3>that's an entrance wound from a bullet.</v>

1570
00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:58.340
<v Speaker 3>That's the Dallas one.</v>

1571
00:41:58.430 --> 00:41:59.510
<v Speaker 3>But on another one,</v>

1572
00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:01.380
<v Speaker 3>see if you see him when he's going around the corner here,</v>

1573
00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.260
<v Speaker 3>he's already holding his neck.</v>

1574
00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:06.110
<v Speaker 3>Look at how he's holding his neck like that.</v>

1575
00:42:06.111 --> 00:42:10.790
<v Speaker 3>He reached up and grabbed himself and he's looking down and ride around.</v>

1576
00:42:10.791 --> 00:42:13.040
<v Speaker 3>He passes the pole and his head blows off.</v>

1577
00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:14.810
<v Speaker 3>Watch this right here.</v>

1578
00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:16.453
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

1579
00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:19.043
<v Speaker 3>What else?</v>

1580
00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:19.610
<v Speaker 3>Hang on.</v>

1581
00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:20.150
<v Speaker 3>Start again.</v>

1582
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.780
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

1583
00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:20.871
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1584
00:42:20.871 --> 00:42:21.011
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1585
00:42:21.011 --> 00:42:21.131
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1586
00:42:21.131 --> 00:42:21.201
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1587
00:42:21.201 --> 00:42:21.490
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1588
00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:21.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1589
00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:22.580
<v Speaker 3>it'd be good to get out the way.</v>

1590
00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:23.850
<v Speaker 3>This isn't super slowly</v>

1591
00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:26.961
<v Speaker 3>disappears,</v>

1592
00:42:26.961 --> 00:42:27.141
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1593
00:42:27.141 --> 00:42:27.441
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1594
00:42:27.441 --> 00:42:27.861
<v Speaker 3>what is that?</v>

1595
00:42:27.861 --> 00:42:28.520
<v Speaker 3>It's like a flower.</v>

1596
00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:31.950
<v Speaker 3>It's just a flap of bone and meet it opened his headlight out.</v>

1597
00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:32.910
<v Speaker 3>So watch,</v>

1598
00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:33.111
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1599
00:42:33.111 --> 00:42:36.830
<v Speaker 3>she ain't go in searching for a piece of hair and she's trying to get the fuck</v>

1600
00:42:36.831 --> 00:42:37.550
<v Speaker 3>off of that.</v>

1601
00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:37.701
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1602
00:42:37.701 --> 00:42:41.590
<v Speaker 3>we don't know when the service guy right behind you,</v>

1603
00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:42.110
<v Speaker 3>bro,</v>

1604
00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:44.510
<v Speaker 3>that's the secret service guy has climbed up at the back of the car and he's</v>

1605
00:42:44.511 --> 00:42:45.530
<v Speaker 3>reaching for her to help her.</v>

1606
00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.150
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

1607
00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:48.043
<v Speaker 3>what a horrible,</v>

1608
00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:49.100
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1609
00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:53.270
<v Speaker 3>but the problem was nobody had seen that until 10 years after the assassination.</v>

1610
00:42:53.271 --> 00:42:54.200
<v Speaker 3>So when they watch it,</v>

1611
00:42:54.201 --> 00:42:54.381
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>

1612
00:42:54.381 --> 00:42:54.681
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1613
00:42:54.681 --> 00:42:56.390
<v Speaker 3>his head goes back into the left.</v>

1614
00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:00.170
<v Speaker 3>That was like that Hicks joke that he kept talking about backing to the left,</v>

1615
00:43:00.171 --> 00:43:01.130
<v Speaker 3>back into the left.</v>

1616
00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:02.271
<v Speaker 3>I mean his,</v>

1617
00:43:02.271 --> 00:43:03.230
<v Speaker 3>he got shot,</v>

1618
00:43:03.231 --> 00:43:06.500
<v Speaker 3>it looked like he was getting shot from the front and it hit the right side of</v>

1619
00:43:06.501 --> 00:43:08.090
<v Speaker 3>his head and his head goes back into the left.</v>

1620
00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:12.410
<v Speaker 3>But there's also some spray that appears to be either going forward,</v>

1621
00:43:12.411 --> 00:43:15.020
<v Speaker 3>it could be an impact spray or the bullet from the front,</v>

1622
00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.950
<v Speaker 3>or it could be that he got shot with two different bullets at the same time.</v>

1623
00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:19.581
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

1624
00:43:19.581 --> 00:43:20.150
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1625
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.391
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1626
00:43:20.391 --> 00:43:23.150
<v Speaker 3>it's very possible that he got hit from the front and the back.</v>

1627
00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:26.690
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] it's basically very hard to tell what happened with one angle.</v>

1628
00:43:26.691 --> 00:43:27.080
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1629
00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:27.261
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1630
00:43:27.261 --> 00:43:28.790
<v Speaker 3>you know for sure he got shot in the head.</v>

1631
00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:31.220
<v Speaker 3>His head blew apart.</v>

1632
00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:33.800
<v Speaker 3>What's crazy to me after all these years,</v>

1633
00:43:33.801 --> 00:43:35.000
<v Speaker 3>we don't know for a fact.</v>

1634
00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:35.481
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1635
00:43:35.481 --> 00:43:36.050
<v Speaker 3>they can't.</v>

1636
00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:39.800
<v Speaker 3>There's no way they can know that came out and watch it again.</v>

1637
00:43:39.801 --> 00:43:40.461
<v Speaker 3>Watch this again.</v>

1638
00:43:40.461 --> 00:43:41.090
<v Speaker 3>Now Watch,</v>

1639
00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:41.450
<v Speaker 3>watch.</v>

1640
00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:45.680
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to tell if this is an impact spray or if it's an exit.</v>

1641
00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:46.573
<v Speaker 3>Where's his head at?</v>

1642
00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:47.600
<v Speaker 3>His head is right there.</v>

1643
00:43:47.601 --> 00:43:48.800
<v Speaker 3>It's like an impact right there.</v>

1644
00:43:48.801 --> 00:43:49.130
<v Speaker 3>Hey Man.</v>

1645
00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:49.970
<v Speaker 3>But could be,</v>

1646
00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.460
<v Speaker 3>it could be an impact spray from the front.</v>

1647
00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:54.490
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile it,</v>

1648
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:58.340
<v Speaker 3>it very well could be that it's an exit spray too.</v>

1649
00:43:58.570 --> 00:44:02.030
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is his head goes back into the left.</v>

1650
00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:03.440
<v Speaker 3>But here's the question.</v>

1651
00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:06.920
<v Speaker 3>Does it go back to the left from the momentum of getting hit in the head with a</v>

1652
00:44:06.921 --> 00:44:11.270
<v Speaker 3>bullet or is it a spasm from a dying body like your,</v>

1653
00:44:11.271 --> 00:44:14.630
<v Speaker 3>your body locks up and it just throws itself into a convulsion.</v>

1654
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:15.920
<v Speaker 3>That's possible too.</v>

1655
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:19.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean a lot of crazy shit happens when you get shot in the fucking head.</v>

1656
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:21.830
<v Speaker 3>And he was a real cocksman too.</v>

1657
00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:22.730
<v Speaker 3>I bet he was.</v>

1658
00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:25.340
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think that had anything cause you don't think I'm just saying to be</v>

1659
00:44:25.341 --> 00:44:27.050
<v Speaker 3>Harvey Oswald acted alone.</v>

1660
00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:29.510
<v Speaker 3>I do not think Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.</v>

1661
00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:30.170
<v Speaker 3>I do not.</v>

1662
00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:31.500
<v Speaker 3>I do not think that even,</v>

1663
00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:32.280
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1664
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.650
<v Speaker 3>even reasonable to assume that he acted alone.</v>

1665
00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:35.791
<v Speaker 3>There's way,</v>

1666
00:44:35.791 --> 00:44:38.490
<v Speaker 3>way too many people that invest in interest in killing him.</v>

1667
00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:39.600
<v Speaker 3>Like a Cubans,</v>

1668
00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:40.400
<v Speaker 3>like every,</v>

1669
00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:41.520
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of people,</v>

1670
00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:43.680
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of people that wanted him dead.</v>

1671
00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:48.780
<v Speaker 3>And it depends on what varying version of the story you're willing to buy into.</v>

1672
00:44:48.781 --> 00:44:50.580
<v Speaker 3>But what is possible,</v>

1673
00:44:50.581 --> 00:44:52.620
<v Speaker 3>and this is one thing that people don't want to consider,</v>

1674
00:44:52.621 --> 00:44:56.580
<v Speaker 3>they think either Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone or at some wacky tinfoil hat</v>

1675
00:44:56.581 --> 00:44:57.414
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy.</v>

1676
00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:58.530
<v Speaker 3>I say neither.</v>

1677
00:44:58.531 --> 00:44:59.850
<v Speaker 3>I say it might be both.</v>

1678
00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:02.130
<v Speaker 3>I say Lee Harvey Oswald could have been in on it.</v>

1679
00:45:02.131 --> 00:45:02.964
<v Speaker 3>He seemed like a,</v>

1680
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:05.610
<v Speaker 3>like a gullible guy and a lot of ways.</v>

1681
00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:06.270
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1682
00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:07.103
<v Speaker 3>He'd been to Russia.</v>

1683
00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:07.831
<v Speaker 3>You've been rushed too,</v>

1684
00:45:07.831 --> 00:45:08.690
<v Speaker 3>but he lived in Russia.</v>

1685
00:45:08.691 --> 00:45:09.810
<v Speaker 3>He's married to a Russian woman,</v>

1686
00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:14.280
<v Speaker 3>Lee Harvey Oswald was most certainly at least in cahoots with the FBI.</v>

1687
00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:15.360
<v Speaker 3>He definitely,</v>

1688
00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:16.440
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1689
00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:16.650
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1690
00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:16.801
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1691
00:45:16.801 --> 00:45:19.800
<v Speaker 3>he definitely did some things for other organizations.</v>

1692
00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:20.580
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1693
00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:23.100
<v Speaker 3>and brought over during the Cold War.</v>

1694
00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:27.840
<v Speaker 3>A Russian wife lived over in Russia and then got back in the United States and</v>

1695
00:45:27.841 --> 00:45:28.674
<v Speaker 3>brought over as Russia.</v>

1696
00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:29.730
<v Speaker 3>We did also going to Cuba,</v>

1697
00:45:29.731 --> 00:45:29.971
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1698
00:45:29.971 --> 00:45:31.390
<v Speaker 3>Didn't he spent time in Cuba believe?</v>

1699
00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:32.221
<v Speaker 3>I believe he did.</v>

1700
00:45:32.221 --> 00:45:32.461
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1701
00:45:32.461 --> 00:45:33.091
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember that.</v>

1702
00:45:33.091 --> 00:45:34.590
<v Speaker 3>But I know for a fact he lived in Russia.</v>

1703
00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:36.960
<v Speaker 3>Communist spoke Russian,</v>

1704
00:45:36.961 --> 00:45:38.690
<v Speaker 3>but he was part of a,</v>

1705
00:45:38.691 --> 00:45:39.840
<v Speaker 3>a Cuban movement,</v>

1706
00:45:39.841 --> 00:45:41.450
<v Speaker 3>like a liberty for Cuba.</v>

1707
00:45:41.830 --> 00:45:42.620
<v Speaker 3>Cuba.</v>

1708
00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:43.770
<v Speaker 3>I spent time in Cuba.</v>

1709
00:45:43.771 --> 00:45:44.604
<v Speaker 3>Might have,</v>

1710
00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:46.110
<v Speaker 3>he didn't go to Cuba.</v>

1711
00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:46.441
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1712
00:45:46.441 --> 00:45:46.821
<v Speaker 3>well Jamie,</v>

1713
00:45:46.821 --> 00:45:47.460
<v Speaker 3>you'll find it.</v>

1714
00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:47.781
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>

1715
00:45:47.781 --> 00:45:51.600
<v Speaker 3>but the bottom line is he easily could have been working for the government and</v>

1716
00:45:51.601 --> 00:45:54.840
<v Speaker 3>he easily could have been a part of the plan and he easily could have been a guy</v>

1717
00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:56.350
<v Speaker 3>that they fell maybe was,</v>

1718
00:45:56.410 --> 00:45:57.000
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1719
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:57.900
<v Speaker 3>they set him up.</v>

1720
00:45:57.930 --> 00:45:58.800
<v Speaker 3>Is he still alive?</v>

1721
00:45:58.860 --> 00:45:59.291
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1722
00:45:59.291 --> 00:46:03.510
<v Speaker 3>we got shot by Jack Ruby like a couple days after he shot Kennedy or allegedly</v>

1723
00:46:03.511 --> 00:46:04.344
<v Speaker 3>shot 10</v>

1724
00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:07.560
<v Speaker 3>died of cancer in jail.</v>

1725
00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:08.341
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>

1726
00:46:08.341 --> 00:46:12.900
<v Speaker 3>Jack Ruby was a mob guy that was deeply beholden to all these different groups</v>

1727
00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:14.370
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1728
00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:15.450
<v Speaker 3>which is very weird.</v>

1729
00:46:15.451 --> 00:46:15.691
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1730
00:46:15.691 --> 00:46:15.891
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1731
00:46:15.891 --> 00:46:16.740
<v Speaker 3>Why would Jack Ruby,</v>

1732
00:46:16.741 --> 00:46:18.540
<v Speaker 3>a mob guy kill,</v>

1733
00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:22.770
<v Speaker 3>can meet Harvey Oswald in broad daylight while he's being escorted?</v>

1734
00:46:22.771 --> 00:46:23.161
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

1735
00:46:23.161 --> 00:46:24.020
<v Speaker 3>What would they,</v>

1736
00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:24.391
<v Speaker 3>they were like,</v>

1737
00:46:24.391 --> 00:46:24.541
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1738
00:46:24.541 --> 00:46:25.710
<v Speaker 3>he felt so bad for Jackie.</v>

1739
00:46:25.711 --> 00:46:26.730
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

1740
00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:31.860
<v Speaker 3>The JFK story is vast.</v>

1741
00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.680
<v Speaker 3>It would take you fucking 25 hours.</v>

1742
00:46:34.681 --> 00:46:35.970
<v Speaker 3>People have written books on it.</v>

1743
00:46:35.971 --> 00:46:36.181
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1744
00:46:36.181 --> 00:46:37.800
<v Speaker 3>it's so deep.</v>

1745
00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:39.600
<v Speaker 3>Everybody want JFK debt.</v>

1746
00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:41.930
<v Speaker 3>The CII wanted them to get oh,</v>

1747
00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:44.380
<v Speaker 3>MCS and in Cuba and so union,</v>

1748
00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:47.430
<v Speaker 3>so he wasn't killing oil.</v>

1749
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:49.470
<v Speaker 3>One that everybody wanted him dead.</v>

1750
00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:51.180
<v Speaker 3>So was trying to change the world.</v>

1751
00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:55.230
<v Speaker 3>He visited embassies and Cuba and the Soviet Union to plot his escape before</v>

1752
00:46:55.231 --> 00:46:56.430
<v Speaker 3>assassinating John F.</v>

1753
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:56.580
<v Speaker 3>Kennedy.</v>

1754
00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:57.930
<v Speaker 3>I think he was in on it.</v>

1755
00:46:58.050 --> 00:46:58.883
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think.</v>

1756
00:46:58.890 --> 00:46:59.723
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

1757
00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:00.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1758
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:02.520
<v Speaker 3>Leo Oswald didn't act alone,</v>

1759
00:47:02.521 --> 00:47:06.060
<v Speaker 3>but I do believe he was in on it and I bet he didn't pull the trigger.</v>

1760
00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:08.610
<v Speaker 3>I bet a bunch of other people pull the trigger and a bet.</v>

1761
00:47:08.611 --> 00:47:09.090
<v Speaker 3>Who's the,</v>

1762
00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:10.870
<v Speaker 3>he was the guy they set up command.</v>

1763
00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:11.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1764
00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:13.890
<v Speaker 3>because like Dallas,</v>

1765
00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:14.340
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1766
00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:15.210
<v Speaker 3>Howard hunt is,</v>

1767
00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:16.020
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

1768
00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:16.141
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

1769
00:47:16.141 --> 00:47:18.420
<v Speaker 3>Howard hunt was in the CIA.</v>

1770
00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:21.690
<v Speaker 3>He was part of a Watergate.</v>

1771
00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:22.400
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

1772
00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:25.860
<v Speaker 3>he's very big in the CIA on his deathbed.</v>

1773
00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:26.753
<v Speaker 3>He says that,</v>

1774
00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:27.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1775
00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:30.040
<v Speaker 3>that was all the assassins from</v>

1776
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.900
<v Speaker 2>operation 40 operations.</v>

1777
00:47:31.901 --> 00:47:33.040
<v Speaker 2>40 was a unit that,</v>

1778
00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:34.270
<v Speaker 2>that um,</v>

1779
00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:36.940
<v Speaker 2>they put together to assassinate Fidel Castro,</v>

1780
00:47:36.941 --> 00:47:38.410
<v Speaker 2>all these international killers.</v>

1781
00:47:38.411 --> 00:47:38.981
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>

1782
00:47:38.981 --> 00:47:39.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1783
00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:42.240
<v Speaker 2>like the murder incorporated operation it,</v>

1784
00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:42.971
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1785
00:47:42.971 --> 00:47:43.780
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1786
00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:44.440
<v Speaker 2>All these,</v>

1787
00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:44.711
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1788
00:47:44.711 --> 00:47:44.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1789
00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:46.780
<v Speaker 2>snipers and killers,</v>

1790
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:48.023
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1791
00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:49.990
<v Speaker 2>anti Castro,</v>

1792
00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:50.950
<v Speaker 2>Cubans,</v>

1793
00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:51.701
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1794
00:47:51.701 --> 00:47:52.590
<v Speaker 2>there were exiled.</v>

1795
00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:53.830
<v Speaker 2>They all got together.</v>

1796
00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:55.390
<v Speaker 2>They tried to kill Fidel Castro.</v>

1797
00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:56.770
<v Speaker 2>Bay of Pigs failed.</v>

1798
00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:58.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1799
00:47:58.270 --> 00:47:59.103
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1800
00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:00.360
<v Speaker 2>because JFK made,</v>

1801
00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:01.840
<v Speaker 2>part of the reason was because,</v>

1802
00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:02.501
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1803
00:48:02.501 --> 00:48:03.490
<v Speaker 2>JFK didn't,</v>

1804
00:48:03.590 --> 00:48:04.423
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1805
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:05.343
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1806
00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:05.801
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1807
00:48:05.801 --> 00:48:06.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1808
00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:07.980
<v Speaker 2>he didn't want any air support.</v>

1809
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:09.430
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want to be any part.</v>

1810
00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:10.810
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want any part of Bay of pigs.</v>

1811
00:48:10.811 --> 00:48:13.900
<v Speaker 2>So the CIA felt like they got abandoned by JFK.</v>

1812
00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.810
<v Speaker 2>JFK fires the head of the CIA.</v>

1813
00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:20.770
<v Speaker 2>So right there there's a big rift between the CIA and JFK.</v>

1814
00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:23.640
<v Speaker 2>The mob hated JFK too,</v>

1815
00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.750
<v Speaker 2>because they were supposed to protect them up.</v>

1816
00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:27.400
<v Speaker 2>Robert Kennedy and JFK,</v>

1817
00:48:27.401 --> 00:48:29.530
<v Speaker 2>but because their dad was a mobster,</v>

1818
00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:31.180
<v Speaker 2>so they thought they were going to be protected.</v>

1819
00:48:31.181 --> 00:48:35.770
<v Speaker 2>So the mom spent all this money to get JFK n and then he's turning on him and,</v>

1820
00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:37.630
<v Speaker 2>and Robert Kennedy's brother,</v>

1821
00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:38.860
<v Speaker 2>he's the attorney general.</v>

1822
00:48:38.861 --> 00:48:40.000
<v Speaker 2>He's going after the mob.</v>

1823
00:48:40.001 --> 00:48:40.391
<v Speaker 2>So they're like,</v>

1824
00:48:40.391 --> 00:48:40.661
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1825
00:48:40.661 --> 00:48:41.650
<v Speaker 2>we got to stop these months.</v>

1826
00:48:41.770 --> 00:48:42.730
<v Speaker 2>So when you look,</v>

1827
00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:43.810
<v Speaker 2>when you look really,</v>

1828
00:48:43.811 --> 00:48:44.501
<v Speaker 2>really look into it,</v>

1829
00:48:44.501 --> 00:48:45.580
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people wanted him dead.</v>

1830
00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:47.080
<v Speaker 2>Big Oil wanted him dead.</v>

1831
00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:48.400
<v Speaker 2>They killed them in Texas.</v>

1832
00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.200
<v Speaker 2>Lyndon B Johnson,</v>

1833
00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:51.460
<v Speaker 2>Lyndon B Johnson,</v>

1834
00:48:51.461 --> 00:48:54.880
<v Speaker 2>the vice president was about to be indicted for tumors.</v>

1835
00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:57.040
<v Speaker 2>He had the,</v>

1836
00:48:57.041 --> 00:48:58.000
<v Speaker 2>you know how uh,</v>

1837
00:48:58.210 --> 00:48:59.043
<v Speaker 2>he stopped that.</v>

1838
00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:00.700
<v Speaker 2>JFK got assassinated.</v>

1839
00:49:00.701 --> 00:49:01.511
<v Speaker 2>He becomes president.</v>

1840
00:49:01.511 --> 00:49:02.650
<v Speaker 2>He pardons himself.</v>

1841
00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:09.100
<v Speaker 2>He was a crazy time,</v>

1842
00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:13.660
<v Speaker 2>was not a lot on his deathbed.</v>

1843
00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:17.300
<v Speaker 2>Said operation for the Bolivia,</v>

1844
00:49:17.310 --> 00:49:18.320
<v Speaker 2>assassins for operations,</v>

1845
00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:19.840
<v Speaker 2>40 were all there.</v>

1846
00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:21.640
<v Speaker 2>They were all there to watch the,</v>

1847
00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:22.391
<v Speaker 2>the big event.</v>

1848
00:49:22.391 --> 00:49:24.430
<v Speaker 2>They all collaborate and he says he's on his death.</v>

1849
00:49:24.431 --> 00:49:25.040
<v Speaker 2>But here's even,</v>

1850
00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:25.990
<v Speaker 2>he was there as a bomb.</v>

1851
00:49:25.991 --> 00:49:26.950
<v Speaker 2>He was one of the bumps.</v>

1852
00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:28.000
<v Speaker 2>We were all watching it.</v>

1853
00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:29.200
<v Speaker 2>There's a photograph of him,</v>

1854
00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:31.360
<v Speaker 2>there's a photograph of him from the arrest.</v>

1855
00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:33.160
<v Speaker 2>They arrested a bunch of Hobos.</v>

1856
00:49:33.161 --> 00:49:33.760
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

1857
00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:35.160
<v Speaker 2>getting off the top killers.</v>

1858
00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:36.250
<v Speaker 2>They were all assassins.</v>

1859
00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:39.940
<v Speaker 2>They were and they've identified some of the guys who were on that,</v>

1860
00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:41.021
<v Speaker 2>on that train.</v>

1861
00:49:41.021 --> 00:49:44.170
<v Speaker 2>One of them was a fucking the the actor.</v>

1862
00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:45.310
<v Speaker 2>The fuck's his name.</v>

1863
00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:46.450
<v Speaker 2>Woody Harrelson.</v>

1864
00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:46.991
<v Speaker 2>Harrelson.</v>

1865
00:49:46.991 --> 00:49:47.970
<v Speaker 2>Where do you house his dad.</v>

1866
00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:51.560
<v Speaker 2>His Dad was an assassin like legitimate,</v>

1867
00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:54.370
<v Speaker 2>like crazy and so he,</v>

1868
00:49:54.371 --> 00:49:55.720
<v Speaker 2>I would hunt on his death bed.</v>

1869
00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:59.380
<v Speaker 2>You can watch this at the library on you too.</v>

1870
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:03.100
<v Speaker 2>He said he was,</v>

1871
00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:04.870
<v Speaker 2>he was bench warming.</v>

1872
00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:05.710
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

1873
00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:07.660
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot just in case something went wrong.</v>

1874
00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:08.860
<v Speaker 2>There was a bunch of people there.</v>

1875
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:09.880
<v Speaker 2>He was getting shot.</v>

1876
00:50:09.881 --> 00:50:14.410
<v Speaker 2>He was getting lit up from all sorts of the Hobos were undercover cops?</v>

1877
00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:15.520
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1878
00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:15.681
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1879
00:50:15.681 --> 00:50:16.620
<v Speaker 2>The hobos were like,</v>

1880
00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:22.660
<v Speaker 2>at least one of the Hobos has been identified as a known so not just the hour</v>

1881
00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:22.661
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

1882
00:50:22.661 --> 00:50:25.240
<v Speaker 2>but there's other guys that have like people have broken down the photos of the</v>

1883
00:50:25.241 --> 00:50:27.800
<v Speaker 2>Hobos and they said that that this guy is that guy,</v>

1884
00:50:27.801 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 2>this</v>

1885
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:28.220
<v Speaker 3>guy,</v>

1886
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:28.790
<v Speaker 3>an assassin.</v>

1887
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:30.030
<v Speaker 3>Like what they weigh it,</v>

1888
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:33.560
<v Speaker 3>it seems like they had done was they had planned to kill Kennedy and they</v>

1889
00:50:33.561 --> 00:50:36.680
<v Speaker 3>planned to do it in Dallas for some reason and they brought in a bunch of</v>

1890
00:50:36.681 --> 00:50:37.520
<v Speaker 3>different people to do it.</v>

1891
00:50:37.521 --> 00:50:39.200
<v Speaker 3>Now here's where it gets really squirrely.</v>

1892
00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:42.950
<v Speaker 3>When you find out how many people who are witnesses who testified that they were</v>

1893
00:50:42.951 --> 00:50:47.150
<v Speaker 3>there at the shooting wound up dying and really fucked up ways.</v>

1894
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:49.340
<v Speaker 3>They wound up dying by murder.</v>

1895
00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:52.760
<v Speaker 3>They wound up dying and weird car accidents where they're fucking break lines</v>

1896
00:50:52.761 --> 00:50:53.450
<v Speaker 3>were cut.</v>

1897
00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:54.710
<v Speaker 3>There was a ton of them.</v>

1898
00:50:54.711 --> 00:50:56.150
<v Speaker 3>So many of them that they,</v>

1899
00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:56.720
<v Speaker 3>someone,</v>

1900
00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.250
<v Speaker 3>I think it might've been lifting as well.</v>

1901
00:50:58.251 --> 00:51:00.500
<v Speaker 3>David lifting the same guy who wrote best evidence.</v>

1902
00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:04.940
<v Speaker 3>They had some calculation on what the odds are of all these people meeting</v>

1903
00:51:04.941 --> 00:51:08.660
<v Speaker 3>violent demises inside of two years and it was crazy,</v>

1904
00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:09.643
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

1905
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:12.350
<v Speaker 3>See if you could find that young Jamie from funnel.</v>

1906
00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:13.340
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1907
00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:15.050
<v Speaker 3>How many people see if the,</v>

1908
00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:18.500
<v Speaker 3>the the amount of people who witnessed the Kennedy assassination,</v>

1909
00:51:18.501 --> 00:51:20.840
<v Speaker 3>who wound up dying under mysterious circumstances.</v>

1910
00:51:20.841 --> 00:51:21.680
<v Speaker 3>Crazy shit.</v>

1911
00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:23.690
<v Speaker 3>Astronauts.</v>

1912
00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:24.710
<v Speaker 3>Aliens to one.</v>

1913
00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:26.000
<v Speaker 3>It's like a millions to one.</v>

1914
00:51:26.001 --> 00:51:29.300
<v Speaker 3>Like if you look at how many people died and what are the odds of them all like</v>

1915
00:51:29.301 --> 00:51:32.420
<v Speaker 3>getting murdered or killed suicide.</v>

1916
00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:34.100
<v Speaker 3>We are weird suicides,</v>

1917
00:51:34.101 --> 00:51:34.281
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1918
00:51:34.281 --> 00:51:36.770
<v Speaker 3>like hang themselves on a fucking coat rack.</v>

1919
00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:37.730
<v Speaker 3>Like weird shit.</v>

1920
00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:38.121
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1921
00:51:38.121 --> 00:51:38.390
<v Speaker 3>Jay,</v>

1922
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:41.210
<v Speaker 3>the JFK story is deep as fuck.</v>

1923
00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.040
<v Speaker 3>They killed that guy,</v>

1924
00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:42.440
<v Speaker 3>buddy.</v>

1925
00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:44.180
<v Speaker 3>Everybody collaborated.</v>

1926
00:51:44.181 --> 00:51:46.010
<v Speaker 3>They all agreed we need to get rid of this guy.</v>

1927
00:51:46.011 --> 00:51:46.191
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

1928
00:51:46.191 --> 00:51:48.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm surprised more guys as they get older than them,</v>

1929
00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:49.190
<v Speaker 3>their deathbed.</v>

1930
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.910
<v Speaker 3>Don't tell the truth.</v>

1931
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:50.743
<v Speaker 3>Nobody cares.</v>

1932
00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:51.801
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing.</v>

1933
00:51:51.801 --> 00:51:55.610
<v Speaker 3>By then there is also plenty of fake stories are they have to do.</v>

1934
00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:56.180
<v Speaker 3>Look at it.</v>

1935
00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:56.511
<v Speaker 3>Here we go.</v>

1936
00:51:56.511 --> 00:51:56.960
<v Speaker 3>Here.</v>

1937
00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:01.220
<v Speaker 3>Look at this 101,000 trillion to one.</v>

1938
00:52:01.221 --> 00:52:03.240
<v Speaker 3>Some have claimed that a large number of witness,</v>

1939
00:52:03.241 --> 00:52:03.951
<v Speaker 3>an event have died.</v>

1940
00:52:03.951 --> 00:52:06.980
<v Speaker 3>Mysterious circumstances Sunday Times reported that the odds against these</v>

1941
00:52:06.981 --> 00:52:10.100
<v Speaker 3>witnesses being dead by February,</v>

1942
00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:13.370
<v Speaker 3>1967 or 100,000 trillion to one whoa</v>

1943
00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:18.560
<v Speaker 3>admitted he had made a careless journalistic mistake in his book,</v>

1944
00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:23.420
<v Speaker 3>a crossfire author Jim marrs provides a list of 103 people.</v>

1945
00:52:23.421 --> 00:52:27.470
<v Speaker 3>He claims died in mysterious circumstances between 63 and 76 in reality,</v>

1946
00:52:27.471 --> 00:52:29.300
<v Speaker 3>most of these people died of natural causes.</v>

1947
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:31.790
<v Speaker 3>Some of these people did die in accidents.</v>

1948
00:52:31.791 --> 00:52:33.560
<v Speaker 3>Others were murdered or committed suicide.</v>

1949
00:52:33.561 --> 00:52:34.220
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

1950
00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:38.940
<v Speaker 3>these people rarely had information that would have been important in helping</v>

1951
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:39.360
<v Speaker 3>advance.</v>

1952
00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:41.450
<v Speaker 3>That sounds like an editorialization.</v>

1953
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:43.040
<v Speaker 3>I want to know who's writing.</v>

1954
00:52:43.041 --> 00:52:43.671
<v Speaker 3>I think about it.</v>

1955
00:52:43.671 --> 00:52:46.760
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to pull off an assassination and then you're all going to go as</v>

1956
00:52:46.761 --> 00:52:47.091
<v Speaker 3>a group,</v>

1957
00:52:47.091 --> 00:52:48.970
<v Speaker 3>let's kill everybody around there as a matter.</v>

1958
00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:49.830
<v Speaker 3>That's hard to do.</v>

1959
00:52:49.831 --> 00:52:50.511
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't matter.</v>

1960
00:52:50.511 --> 00:52:51.021
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>

1961
00:52:51.021 --> 00:52:51.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't have pain.</v>

1962
00:52:51.610 --> 00:52:52.311
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at that.</v>

1963
00:52:52.311 --> 00:52:52.860
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1964
00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:57.590
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying is what that guy wrote is an editorialization like that might be</v>

1965
00:52:57.591 --> 00:52:58.131
<v Speaker 3>correct,</v>

1966
00:52:58.131 --> 00:52:59.600
<v Speaker 3>but it might be wrong too.</v>

1967
00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:03.440
<v Speaker 3>He's making an assumption and he's writing this guest based on that assumption.</v>

1968
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:03.890
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1969
00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:04.341
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1970
00:53:04.341 --> 00:53:05.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how you'd like,</v>

1971
00:53:05.871 --> 00:53:06.111
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1972
00:53:06.111 --> 00:53:07.700
<v Speaker 3>so you've got all of those witnesses.</v>

1973
00:53:07.701 --> 00:53:08.511
<v Speaker 3>That's how fucking,</v>

1974
00:53:08.511 --> 00:53:09.261
<v Speaker 3>that's really hard.</v>

1975
00:53:09.261 --> 00:53:10.880
<v Speaker 3>Now you've got to organize all those markers.</v>

1976
00:53:10.970 --> 00:53:11.803
<v Speaker 3>Good luck.</v>

1977
00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:14.480
<v Speaker 3>All these different people that were witnesses.</v>

1978
00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:15.111
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

1979
00:53:15.111 --> 00:53:15.311
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

1980
00:53:15.311 --> 00:53:16.101
<v Speaker 3>Make that a little larger,</v>

1981
00:53:16.101 --> 00:53:16.401
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>

1982
00:53:16.401 --> 00:53:18.730
<v Speaker 3>So I could read this shit like this.</v>

1983
00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:22.170
<v Speaker 3>They all die pretty spaced out that a lot of times they're talking to these,</v>

1984
00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:22.461
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1985
00:53:22.461 --> 00:53:23.820
<v Speaker 3>these are all Kennedy's that were whacked.</v>

1986
00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:24.321
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1987
00:53:24.321 --> 00:53:25.154
<v Speaker 3>Well everybody,</v>

1988
00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:25.741
<v Speaker 3>the Kennedys,</v>

1989
00:53:25.741 --> 00:53:25.951
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1990
00:53:25.951 --> 00:53:26.010
<v Speaker 3>they</v>

1991
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:26.220
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

1992
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:27.480
<v Speaker 2>they started out killing the game.</v>

1993
00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:29.370
<v Speaker 2>So they start out as drug runners.</v>

1994
00:53:29.371 --> 00:53:30.990
<v Speaker 2>They were running moonshine.</v>

1995
00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:31.831
<v Speaker 2>That's how they started.</v>

1996
00:53:31.831 --> 00:53:32.664
<v Speaker 2>That's where they made their money.</v>

1997
00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:33.960
<v Speaker 2>Joe Deep.</v>

1998
00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:35.820
<v Speaker 2>And then JFK and,</v>

1999
00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:36.510
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2000
00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:37.320
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2001
00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:38.250
<v Speaker 2>the rest of his sons,</v>

2002
00:53:38.251 --> 00:53:40.230
<v Speaker 2>they started trying to change the world for real.</v>

2003
00:53:40.231 --> 00:53:41.064
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

2004
00:53:41.130 --> 00:53:42.060
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean happening?</v>

2005

<v Speaker 2>Everybody wanted JFK died.</v>

2006
00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:44.401
<v Speaker 2>They knew.</v>

2007
00:53:44.401 --> 00:53:46.770
<v Speaker 2>They joked around about how they knew.</v>

2008
00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:48.300
<v Speaker 2>What they were trying to do is,</v>

2009
00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:49.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2010
00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:50.190
<v Speaker 2>put their lives in jeopardy.</v>

2011
00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:51.120
<v Speaker 2>You know what's really interesting,</v>

2012
00:53:51.121 --> 00:53:51.640

00:55:22.690 --> 00:55:23.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

<v Speaker 2>It isn't just JFK,</v>

2073
00:55:24.421 --> 00:55:25.470
<v Speaker 2>Lee Harvey Oswald,</v>

2074
00:55:25.471 --> 00:55:27.030
<v Speaker 2>and maybe a couple other assassins.</v>

2075
00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:29.130
<v Speaker 2>It's so God damn deep.</v>

2076
00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:31.080
<v Speaker 2>Do you could spend a life,</v>

2077

<v Speaker 2>a lifetime just studying all the names and how they're all connected.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2081
00:55:37.831 --> 00:55:41.070
<v Speaker 2>it's unquestionably a mystery and the idea that it's not,</v>

2082
00:55:41.071 --> 00:55:46.050
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty ridiculous to me that that trial down Nice Greece,</v>

2083
00:55:47.550 --> 00:55:49.210
<v Speaker 2>that wouldn't happen if she had a nice karate.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in big government or anything.</v>

2097
00:56:02.401 --> 00:56:03.660
<v Speaker 2>I believe in small government,</v>

2098
00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:05.860
<v Speaker 2>Libertarian.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Small government.</v>

2103
00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:10.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Total transparency.</v>

<v Speaker 2>All that stuff.</v>

2106
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:12.983
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2107
00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:14.110
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2108
00:56:14.110 --> 00:56:14.250
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2109
00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:17.220
<v Speaker 2>I know you cause you thought because of the Hillary thing now that was just more</v>

2110
00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:18.210
<v Speaker 2>my anti Trump thing.</v>

2111
00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:19.350
<v Speaker 2>I used to,</v>

2112
00:56:19.350 --> 00:56:19.491
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2113
00:56:19.491 --> 00:56:21.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't like Hillary at all.</v>

2114
00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:22.373
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2115
00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:23.140
<v Speaker 2>The one,</v>

2116
00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:23.973
<v Speaker 2>either one of them</v>

2117
00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:25.180
<v Speaker 1>just say you now.</v>

2118
00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:26.093
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2119
00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:27.613
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2120
00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:28.841
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

2121
00:56:28.841 --> 00:56:29.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

2122
00:56:29.250 --> 00:56:30.100
<v Speaker 1>I heard somebody said,</v>

2123
00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:32.680
<v Speaker 1>why do people have an obsession with Kung Fu being real?</v>

2124
00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:34.340
<v Speaker 1>What are they still make these movies?</v>

2125
00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:35.860
<v Speaker 1>All people do stupid.</v>

2126
00:56:35.890 --> 00:56:37.690
<v Speaker 1>Like we know now what works.</v>

2127
00:56:37.810 --> 00:56:39.320
<v Speaker 1>And it seems like for a long time though,</v>

2128
00:56:39.321 --> 00:56:40.480
<v Speaker 1>stupid Kung Fu movies,</v>

2129
00:56:40.481 --> 00:56:42.700
<v Speaker 1>they died off in the UFC became really popular.</v>

2130
00:56:43.090 --> 00:56:47.800
<v Speaker 1>But the appeal of people who could just like magically make people fly from like</v>

2131
00:56:47.801 --> 00:56:49.750
<v Speaker 1>a touch to the chest and shit like that.</v>

2132
00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:52.420
<v Speaker 1>It's so romantic to us that we bring it back.</v>

2133
00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:53.250
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

2134
00:56:53.250 --> 00:56:55.930
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of before we could prove that staff member,</v>

2135
00:56:56.110 --> 00:56:56.943
<v Speaker 1>like what my,</v>

2136
00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:58.120
<v Speaker 1>I remember it,</v>

2137
00:56:58.121 --> 00:56:58.511
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

2138
00:56:58.511 --> 00:56:59.291
<v Speaker 1>it was Asian,</v>

2139
00:56:59.291 --> 00:56:59.561
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2140
00:56:59.561 --> 00:56:59.991
<v Speaker 1>So it was just,</v>

2141
00:56:59.991 --> 00:57:02.170
<v Speaker 1>there was a mystery to being from China.</v>

2142
00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:05.350
<v Speaker 1>There was a mystery from being from Japan where it was it we didn't,</v>

2143
00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:07.080
<v Speaker 1>the languages are so different from,</v>

2144
00:57:07.081 --> 00:57:07.914
<v Speaker 1>from English.</v>

2145
00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:08.800
<v Speaker 1>So for us,</v>

2146
00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:11.350
<v Speaker 1>this idea that they had these secrets,</v>

2147
00:57:11.650 --> 00:57:11.890
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

2148
00:57:11.890 --> 00:57:12.491
<v Speaker 1>these debt,</v>

2149
00:57:12.491 --> 00:57:17.140
<v Speaker 1>like touching things and pass your points and he was so wise and he was so quiet</v>

2150
00:57:17.141 --> 00:57:17.980
<v Speaker 1>and so humble.</v>

2151
00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:19.870
<v Speaker 1>We wanted that person to be,</v>

2152
00:57:19.930 --> 00:57:20.381
<v Speaker 1>to know.</v>

2153
00:57:20.381 --> 00:57:22.360
<v Speaker 1>So we all as human beings want mystery.</v>

2154
00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:23.021
<v Speaker 1>We had this,</v>

2155
00:57:23.021 --> 00:57:23.681
<v Speaker 1>what all this stuff.</v>

2156
00:57:23.681 --> 00:57:24.514
<v Speaker 1>It's about we all,</v>

2157
00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:27.400
<v Speaker 1>we all want to be part of a secret group.</v>

2158
00:57:27.401 --> 00:57:28.090
<v Speaker 1>We all want,</v>

2159
00:57:28.090 --> 00:57:29.590
<v Speaker 1>we want to be in the know all of us.</v>

2160
00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:32.590
<v Speaker 1>So when somebody is a master of Kung Fu and breaks,</v>

2161
00:57:32.591 --> 00:57:34.600
<v Speaker 1>boards can imagine if there's a</v>

2162
00:57:36.690 --> 00:57:37.523

00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:40.080
<v Speaker 1>it will be hilarious.</v>

2165
00:57:40.090 --> 00:57:41.470
<v Speaker 1>Bruce movies were incredible.</v>

2166
00:57:41.471 --> 00:57:46.360
<v Speaker 1>Think about enter the dragon that changed people's entire lives as in they went,</v>

2167
00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:48.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm only going to learn karate and I'm going in that direction.</v>

2168
00:57:48.611 --> 00:57:49.301
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna open a school.</v>

2169
00:57:49.301 --> 00:57:51.840
<v Speaker 1>My whole life is going to be that and you got to walk around with our control</v>

2170
00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:52.660

2171
00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:53.290

2172
00:57:53.290 --> 00:57:54.570
<v Speaker 1>Hey is on queer street right now.</v>

2174
00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:56.633

00:58:00.550 --> 00:58:01.390
<v Speaker 1>That head kick</v>

2178
00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:04.090
<v Speaker 1>and run.</v>

2179
00:58:04.090 --> 00:58:07.480
<v Speaker 1>How she has it to slip to oh boy.</v>

2180
00:58:07.481 --> 00:58:08.590

00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:11.620
<v Speaker 1>Damn powerful shoot for that single.</v>

2182
00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:14.230

2183
00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:15.370
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2184
00:58:15.370 --> 00:58:17.350
<v Speaker 1>I would look at the slides.</v>

2185
00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:19.480
<v Speaker 1>Capillaries to do the spartan style.</v>

2186
00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:19.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2187
00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:23.950
<v Speaker 1>you'd probably should start doing comes Donald flow loose kicking Melvin Manhoef</v>

2188
00:58:23.951 --> 00:58:25.450
<v Speaker 1>member when he used to wear this gladiator ones.</v>

2189
00:58:25.690 --> 00:58:27.850
<v Speaker 1>Those are the bad God shit.</v>

2190
00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:29.880
<v Speaker 1>He does everything hard man.</v>

2191
00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:31.030
<v Speaker 1>No was so scary.</v>

2192
00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:33.960
<v Speaker 1>There's videos of men who have hidden the pads and make you want to never hit</v>

2193
00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:34.893
<v Speaker 1>pads again.</v>

2194
00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:37.180
<v Speaker 1>Well how about this?</v>

2195
00:58:37.630 --> 00:58:42.630
<v Speaker 1>There's a hey of him playing like just Piñata with Robbie Lawler's legs.</v>

2196
00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:43.930
<v Speaker 1>That's the craziest thing.</v>

2197
00:58:43.931 --> 00:58:44.471
<v Speaker 1>When he was kicking.</v>

2198
00:58:44.471 --> 00:58:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Robbie Lawler is one that fine.</v>

2199
00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:47.973
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2200
00:58:49.030 --> 00:58:51.610
<v Speaker 1>hit him back with one belt one?</v>

2201
00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:52.661
<v Speaker 1>I believe so.</v>

2202
00:58:52.661 --> 00:58:53.320
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

2203
00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:54.610
<v Speaker 1>I think she's still doing the day.</v>

2204
00:58:54.850 --> 00:58:56.020
<v Speaker 1>I think he's kickboxing too.</v>

2205
00:58:56.021 --> 00:58:56.711
<v Speaker 1>I think he varies.</v>

2206
00:58:56.711 --> 00:58:57.640
<v Speaker 1>He goes back and forth.</v>

2207
00:58:57.641 --> 00:58:59.200
<v Speaker 1>So explosive it tour,</v>

2208
00:58:59.201 --> 00:58:59.471
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2209
00:58:59.471 --> 00:59:01.390
<v Speaker 1>how's it the big kickboxing organization too.</v>

2210
00:59:01.391 --> 00:59:05.050
<v Speaker 1>So you know a Gaston Bolanos is going back and forth.</v>

2211
00:59:05.051 --> 00:59:08.710
<v Speaker 1>He did his MMA be BW with Dell belter and then he's going to do a kickboxing</v>

2212
00:59:08.711 --> 00:59:09.850
<v Speaker 1>fight with Bella tour in April</v>

2213
00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:12.300
<v Speaker 1>mount.</v>

2214
00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:13.030
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2215
00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:14.500
<v Speaker 1>would you say that um,</v>

2216
00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:18.070
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing get has more head trauma than boxing?</v>

2217
00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:18.850
<v Speaker 1>Yoga?</v>

2218
00:59:18.850 --> 00:59:19.211
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

2219
00:59:19.211 --> 00:59:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

2220
00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:19.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2221
00:59:19.811 --> 00:59:20.650
<v Speaker 1>I would think so.</v>

2222
00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:22.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

2223
00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:24.770
<v Speaker 3>the thing is if the kicks land the thing,</v>

2224
00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:25.070
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2225
00:59:25.070 --> 00:59:26.320
<v Speaker 3>if there are only three rounds though,</v>

2226
00:59:26.321 --> 00:59:27.154
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2227
00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:28.040
<v Speaker 3>Well it depends.</v>

2228
00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:30.260
<v Speaker 3>Some of them are five championship rounds.</v>

2229
00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:30.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2230
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:33.590
<v Speaker 3>but the thing about like,</v>

2231
00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:37.400
<v Speaker 3>it depends if you're more Thai or kickboxing,</v>

2232
00:59:37.790 --> 00:59:38.310
<v Speaker 3>Muay Thai,</v>

2233
00:59:38.310 --> 00:59:42.680
<v Speaker 3>you're definitely getting hit in the head a lot with elbows caught though Joe</v>

2234
00:59:43.250 --> 00:59:46.020
<v Speaker 3>maybe I think it's not as goal straight get back.</v>

2235
00:59:46.090 --> 00:59:47.160
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2236
00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:48.133
<v Speaker 3>but it's true.</v>

2237
00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:50.960
<v Speaker 3>Begs off bitch Korez is fighting with everything.</v>

2238
00:59:50.961 --> 00:59:52.850
<v Speaker 3>She's got to see numbers.</v>

2239
00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:54.830
<v Speaker 3>I would like to see like actual impact numbers.</v>

2240
00:59:54.850 --> 00:59:57.550
<v Speaker 3>Oh she's not sure if that was not good.</v>

2241
00:59:58.070 --> 00:59:58.611
<v Speaker 3>The thing is,</v>

2242
00:59:58.611 --> 01:00:03.560
<v Speaker 3>the potential for getting neck kicked or head kicks ref is,</v>

2243
01:00:03.830 --> 01:00:06.380
<v Speaker 3>but then it's kind of overfishing go on.</v>

2244
01:00:06.381 --> 01:00:07.230
<v Speaker 3>Taking punishments.</v>

2245
01:00:07.231 --> 01:00:07.730
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>

2246
01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:08.540
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point.</v>

2247
01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:11.090
<v Speaker 3>Presenting the question is like what kind of head trauma we talking about?</v>

2248
01:00:11.091 --> 01:00:13.310
<v Speaker 3>We talking about one big bomb.</v>

2249
01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:14.091
<v Speaker 3>What's worse?</v>

2250
01:00:14.091 --> 01:00:16.820
<v Speaker 3>One big bomb or eating like 50,</v>

2251
01:00:16.821 --> 01:00:18.080
<v Speaker 3>triple g jabs.</v>

2252
01:00:18.081 --> 01:00:19.460
<v Speaker 3>50 triple g jabs.</v>

2253
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.280
<v Speaker 3>What people die from usually like this rough a lot.</v>

2254
01:00:22.350 --> 01:00:27.080
<v Speaker 3>You think that's better than Nicole Gonzaga Cro cop.</v>

2255
01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:30.010
<v Speaker 3>Oh hundred percent dude.</v>

2256
01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:31.820
<v Speaker 3>That's cray is very tough.</v>

2257
01:00:31.850 --> 01:00:32.840
<v Speaker 3>You got to respect her,</v>

2258
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:33.290
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>

2259
01:00:33.290 --> 01:00:34.123
<v Speaker 3>her heart here.</v>

2260
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:35.983
<v Speaker 3>You got to,</v>

2261
01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:39.920
<v Speaker 3>do you remember when nobody thought that you'd ever see women fight like this?</v>

2262
01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:44.090
<v Speaker 3>I know like women fights were never really big and boxing.</v>

2263
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:45.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean they kind of,</v>

2264
01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:47.450
<v Speaker 3>they're still not the gold medal winner.</v>

2265
01:00:47.451 --> 01:00:48.380
<v Speaker 3>She's awesome knowledge.</v>

2266
01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:50.990
<v Speaker 3>But you had a few that were like interesting.</v>

2267
01:00:50.991 --> 01:00:54.130
<v Speaker 3>Like Christy Martin and then there was um,</v>

2268
01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:55.041
<v Speaker 3>lay low,</v>

2269
01:00:55.041 --> 01:00:56.180
<v Speaker 3>see a Riker.</v>

2270
01:00:56.210 --> 01:00:59.780
<v Speaker 3>Lucier Ryko was probably one of the best female boxers.</v>

2271
01:01:00.050 --> 01:01:01.340
<v Speaker 3>Probably the best one ever.</v>

2272
01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:02.720
<v Speaker 3>And then Laila Ali,</v>

2273
01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:04.280
<v Speaker 3>because she was Muhammad Ali's daughter,</v>

2274
01:01:04.281 --> 01:01:08.060
<v Speaker 3>she got a lot of press Riker can hit like she was and then there's that other</v>

2275
01:01:08.061 --> 01:01:09.670
<v Speaker 3>girl to mia St John.</v>

2276
01:01:09.690 --> 01:01:10.240
<v Speaker 3>Remember her?</v>

2277
01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.240
<v Speaker 3>What about Christy?</v>

2278
01:01:11.241 --> 01:01:12.080
<v Speaker 3>What was your see Martin,</v>

2279
01:01:12.081 --> 01:01:14.270
<v Speaker 3>the coal miner's daughter back attack.</v>

2280
01:01:14.330 --> 01:01:14.900
<v Speaker 3>Powerful.</v>

2281
01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:16.340
<v Speaker 3>There's just not enough depth.</v>

2282
01:01:16.341 --> 01:01:16.860
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

2283
01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:20.120
<v Speaker 3>it never grows like one girl who dominates,</v>

2284
01:01:20.121 --> 01:01:21.240
<v Speaker 3>but then they just go a,</v>

2285
01:01:21.350 --> 01:01:21.711
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

2286
01:01:21.711 --> 01:01:25.430
<v Speaker 3>How did I forget Anne Wolf and wolf was probably the scariest knockout artists</v>

2287
01:01:25.431 --> 01:01:27.200
<v Speaker 3>waiting for women's boxing.</v>

2288
01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:27.441
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2289
01:01:27.441 --> 01:01:28.370
<v Speaker 3>she's phenomenal.</v>

2290
01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:31.400
<v Speaker 3>And that it's over and she's a sick coach too.</v>

2291
01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:32.660
<v Speaker 3>Amazing coach.</v>

2292
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:34.100
<v Speaker 3>But you know what man,</v>

2293
01:01:34.101 --> 01:01:34.431
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

2294
01:01:34.431 --> 01:01:35.031
<v Speaker 3>it never,</v>

2295
01:01:35.031 --> 01:01:37.550
<v Speaker 3>we never saw this many matchups like,</v>

2296
01:01:37.551 --> 01:01:39.040
<v Speaker 3>and you never saw this many match.</v>

2297
01:01:39.041 --> 01:01:39.351
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2298
01:01:39.351 --> 01:01:43.070
<v Speaker 3>the thing about boxing is you're only really going to see like maybe two fights,</v>

2299
01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:44.120
<v Speaker 3>maybe three.</v>

2300
01:01:44.121 --> 01:01:45.890
<v Speaker 3>If you're really going to watch a pay per view card.</v>

2301
01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:48.020
<v Speaker 3>Do you watch you sit through the whole card?</v>

2302
01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:48.873
<v Speaker 3>Do you,</v>

2303
01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:51.920
<v Speaker 3>cause if I watch a UFC and there's five fights in the main event,</v>

2304
01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:53.091
<v Speaker 3>like in the main car,</v>

2305
01:01:53.091 --> 01:01:56.090
<v Speaker 3>you're going to probably watch every fight and be pumped about it.</v>

2306
01:01:56.120 --> 01:02:00.020
<v Speaker 3>That's why UFC does well in the short amount of time has grown so much because</v>

2307
01:02:00.021 --> 01:02:01.590
<v Speaker 3>the five entertaining fight Jack,</v>

2308
01:02:01.591 --> 01:02:05.930
<v Speaker 3>do you know the people and the kid with Boxton like on the undercard of a Floyd</v>

2309
01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:08.750
<v Speaker 3>Mayweather fights usually shit like why is it like that?</v>

2310
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:09.681
<v Speaker 3>Why not stack?</v>

2311
01:02:09.681 --> 01:02:11.360
<v Speaker 3>It was some good times man.</v>

2312
01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:12.350
<v Speaker 3>Well the UFC,</v>

2313
01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:16.310
<v Speaker 3>they saw the holes in boxing's promotion came and they capitalized on it.</v>

2314
01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:17.031
<v Speaker 3>This is the other thing.</v>

2315
01:02:17.031 --> 01:02:19.650
<v Speaker 3>Why I think women bigger than boxing,</v>

2316
01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:20.030
<v Speaker 3>this</v>

2317
01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:21.300
<v Speaker 1>shit bitch go,</v>

2318
01:02:21.301 --> 01:02:23.250
<v Speaker 1>hey is bridging on a changing on her chin.</v>

2319
01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:25.290
<v Speaker 1>But how much pressure are you allowed to apply?</v>

2320
01:02:25.291 --> 01:02:26.850
<v Speaker 1>Cause you can't strike with your head,</v>

2321
01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:27.813
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2322
01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:29.640
<v Speaker 1>You can't put all the pressure you want,</v>

2323
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:30.330
<v Speaker 1>but can you batch,</v>

2324
01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:31.950
<v Speaker 1>you can backwards headbutted he can,</v>

2325
01:02:31.951 --> 01:02:33.180
<v Speaker 1>you know you can't have but,</v>

2326
01:02:33.330 --> 01:02:34.051
<v Speaker 1>but you could put any,</v>

2327
01:02:34.051 --> 01:02:36.030
<v Speaker 1>what do you do here when they had that weird though,</v>

2328
01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:36.870
<v Speaker 1>come on man,</v>

2329
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:38.340
<v Speaker 1>you could head kick somebody's butt.</v>

2330
01:02:38.341 --> 01:02:41.760
<v Speaker 1>You can't backwards head buttom why can't you backwards?</v>

2331
01:02:41.770 --> 01:02:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Headbutt him backwards head.</v>

2332
01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.500
<v Speaker 1>But I feel like you should be able to do,</v>

2333
01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:46.373
<v Speaker 1>you can't hit button.</v>

2334
01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:47.420
<v Speaker 1>And you know what?</v>

2335
01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:49.770
<v Speaker 1>Let me start that league and that the tennis court.</v>

2336
01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:50.800
<v Speaker 1>Well make that happen.</v>

2337
01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:52.880
<v Speaker 1>Don't you feel like that?</v>

2338
01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:53.820
<v Speaker 1>You should be able to backwards.</v>

2339
01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:54.991
<v Speaker 1>How can we,</v>

2340
01:02:54.991 --> 01:02:55.300
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2341
01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:56.790
<v Speaker 1>we tennis court size.</v>

2342
01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:00.340
<v Speaker 1>We agreed on this way.</v>

2343
01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:04.890
<v Speaker 1>We know like there's something that accentuates the bigger than a basketball</v>

2344
01:03:04.891 --> 01:03:05.490
<v Speaker 1>court.</v>

2345
01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:06.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2346
01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:06.630
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2347
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:07.080
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2348
01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:07.410
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2349
01:03:07.410 --> 01:03:07.740
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2350
01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:08.650
<v Speaker 1>Basketball courts picker.</v>

2351
01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh by the tennis court is I believe a hundred feet.</v>

2352
01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:15.180
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2353
01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:15.630
<v Speaker 1>How long?</v>

2354
01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:16.201
<v Speaker 1>How long is it,</v>

2355
01:03:16.201 --> 01:03:17.190
<v Speaker 1>what's bigger Jamie?</v>

2356
01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:18.840
<v Speaker 1>I think basketball is longer.</v>

2357
01:03:18.841 --> 01:03:19.680
<v Speaker 1>Tennis is wider.</v>

2358
01:03:19.890 --> 01:03:20.280
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

2359
01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:23.420
<v Speaker 1>People ask you questions in real life and ask you to pull that shit out.</v>

2360
01:03:23.421 --> 01:03:23.631
<v Speaker 1>Doing this.</v>

2361
01:03:23.631 --> 01:03:24.464
<v Speaker 1>My life</v>

2362
01:03:25.870 --> 01:03:28.410
<v Speaker 1>courts are 78 feet basketball courts in 94.</v>

2363
01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:28.951
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2364
01:03:28.951 --> 01:03:29.910
<v Speaker 1>so it was a little rain.</v>

2365
01:03:30.550 --> 01:03:31.830
<v Speaker 1>Get to the basketball game.</v>

2366
01:03:34.890 --> 01:03:35.551
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing.</v>

2367
01:03:35.551 --> 01:03:37.020
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that you should be able,</v>

2368
01:03:37.021 --> 01:03:37.430
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

2369
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:39.630
<v Speaker 1>if you're able to elbow someone in the face,</v>

2370
01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:43.330
<v Speaker 1>why can't you backwards head and someone going to die because you backwards head</v>

2371
01:03:43.331 --> 01:03:45.270
<v Speaker 1>butted somebody that knows.</v>

2372
01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:46.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2373
01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:47.223
<v Speaker 1>add it.</v>

2374
01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:48.091
<v Speaker 1>The technique,</v>

2375
01:03:48.091 --> 01:03:49.110
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's a real tank.</v>

2376
01:03:49.111 --> 01:03:49.601
<v Speaker 1>Tech head.</v>

2377
01:03:49.601 --> 01:03:53.640
<v Speaker 1>Bunch of BS percent headbutt hundred percent 100 the back of the head.</v>

2378
01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:56.880
<v Speaker 1>You know what I feel like if you don't ask</v>

2379
01:03:58.790 --> 01:04:00.000
<v Speaker 1>someone for a neck kick.</v>

2380
01:04:00.090 --> 01:04:00.511
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2381
01:04:00.511 --> 01:04:02.970
<v Speaker 1>If your neck kicking someone and you're getting them back here.</v>

2382
01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:06.030
<v Speaker 1>If a guy standing like this and you're coming over the top of the right kick,</v>

2383
01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:08.040
<v Speaker 1>you weren't hitting him in the back of the fucking head.</v>

2384
01:04:08.070 --> 01:04:08.903
<v Speaker 1>What do you think Brandon?</v>

2385
01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:12.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm cool with tech back here.</v>

2386
01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:14.431
<v Speaker 1>I'm cool with headbutts.</v>

2387
01:04:14.431 --> 01:04:15.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm not cool with,</v>

2388
01:04:15.331 --> 01:04:18.030
<v Speaker 1>if you have someone's back elbow in the back of the head just cause there's a</v>

2389
01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:18.873
<v Speaker 1>law,</v>

2390
01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:22.740
<v Speaker 1>there's not a ton of all fucking dangerous.</v>

2391
01:04:22.741 --> 01:04:25.440
<v Speaker 1>It's all at the back of the head can make you can go blind.</v>

2392
01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:27.240
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

2393
01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.073
<v Speaker 1>very vulnerable</v>

2394
01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:32.290
<v Speaker 1>because it's permanent damage to the eyeballs,</v>

2395
01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:34.793
<v Speaker 1>not my brain bro.</v>

2396
01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:39.840
<v Speaker 1>You're hitting the ball arenas on Indian reservations.</v>

2397
01:04:39.841 --> 01:04:40.930
<v Speaker 1>That's what we find out.</v>

2398
01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:46.360
<v Speaker 1>Those who were not to take this to Indians and the has got a lot.</v>

2399
01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:48.060
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to,</v>

2400
01:04:48.061 --> 01:04:49.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm not giving this to,</v>

<v Speaker 1>so if we did it,</v>

2423
01:05:21.971 --> 01:05:23.470
<v Speaker 1>we'd have to do it on an Indian reservation.</v>

2424
01:05:23.530 --> 01:05:24.363
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2434
01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:39.380
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to test a basketball arena though on an Indian reservation.</v>

2435
01:05:39.381 --> 01:05:39.730
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:43.331
<v Speaker 1>The whole point is,</v>

2439
01:05:43.331 --> 01:05:44.270
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta be on a bath.</v>

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:44.921
<v Speaker 1>You build it.</v>

2441
01:05:44.921 --> 01:05:45.521
<v Speaker 1>They will come.</v>

2442
01:05:45.521 --> 01:05:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Let's just build one ourselves.</v>

2443
01:05:47.050 --> 01:05:48.580
<v Speaker 1>Caught the fight companion arena.</v>

2444
01:05:48.610 --> 01:05:48.731
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2445
01:05:48.731 --> 01:05:53.590
<v Speaker 1>if you just have it in a basketball sized flat area at the bottom of their</v>

2446
01:05:53.591 --> 01:05:54.340
<v Speaker 1>arena,</v>

2447
01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:55.300
<v Speaker 1>they must have an arena.</v>

2448
01:05:55.301 --> 01:05:56.270
<v Speaker 1>If they're having these events.</v>

2449
01:05:56.290 --> 01:05:57.520
<v Speaker 1>Now you're talking about WCL,</v>

2450
01:05:57.521 --> 01:05:58.550
<v Speaker 1>the Chuck Norris Shifts.</v>

2451
01:05:58.990 --> 01:05:59.823
<v Speaker 1>You had one in there.</v>

2452
01:05:59.950 --> 01:06:04.150
<v Speaker 1>You just have that center area where you have that octagon spread it out by at</v>

2453
01:06:04.151 --> 01:06:06.370
<v Speaker 1>least another seven feet on each side.</v>

2454
01:06:06.550 --> 01:06:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Get rid of this mat it down.</v>

2455
01:06:08.001 --> 01:06:08.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2456
01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:08.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2457
01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:09.370
<v Speaker 1>Matt it down.</v>

2458
01:06:09.370 --> 01:06:12.250
<v Speaker 1>That's what that place was because this is a Olympic training center where the</v>

2459
01:06:12.251 --> 01:06:14.770
<v Speaker 1>had a lot of the Olympic stuff like wrestling and stuff like that,</v>

2460
01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:15.611
<v Speaker 1>so he could do that.</v>

2461
01:06:15.611 --> 01:06:17.320
<v Speaker 1>They're the only really issue.</v>

2462
01:06:17.350 --> 01:06:20.850
<v Speaker 1>The only real issue would be people storming the s the f,</v>

2463
01:06:20.890 --> 01:06:22.840
<v Speaker 1>the flat area where the people are competing.</v>

2464
01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:22.991
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2465
01:06:22.991 --> 01:06:25.330
<v Speaker 1>you got to act like a Goddamn like they do and I do</v>

2466
01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:30.340
<v Speaker 1>wonder what you would be able to do to stop that though,</v>

2467
01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:32.930
<v Speaker 1>because the thing is if somebody wanted to charge octagon,</v>

2468
01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:33.671
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

2469
01:06:33.671 --> 01:06:34.840
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of steps.</v>

2470
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:36.130
<v Speaker 1>Good like charging that,</v>

2471
01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:36.993
<v Speaker 1>huh?</v>

2472
01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:38.023
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2473
01:06:38.110 --> 01:06:38.351
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2474
01:06:38.351 --> 01:06:39.131
<v Speaker 1>security might work,</v>

2475
01:06:39.131 --> 01:06:42.870
<v Speaker 1>but if there's actually like a mob basketball games,</v>

2476
01:06:43.050 --> 01:06:45.070
<v Speaker 1>if they just wanted a file out onto the court,</v>

2477
01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:45.410
<v Speaker 1>it could be,</v>

2478
01:06:45.410 --> 01:06:46.061
<v Speaker 1>it never happened.</v>

2479
01:06:46.061 --> 01:06:47.290
<v Speaker 1>The basketball happened once.</v>

2480
01:06:47.291 --> 01:06:48.220
<v Speaker 1>These are fighters,</v>

2481
01:06:48.221 --> 01:06:49.270
<v Speaker 1>they're savages.</v>

2482
01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:50.000
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2483
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.520
<v Speaker 1>the crowd's not going to be savages.</v>

2484
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:54.460
<v Speaker 1>Some nightclub in the audience and someone in the audit.</v>

2485
01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:57.250
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember when Anson anyway fought frank shamrock</v>

2486
01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:01.180
<v Speaker 1>and frank shamrock was,</v>

2487
01:07:01.181 --> 01:07:02.140
<v Speaker 1>is he fight hen center?</v>

2488
01:07:02.141 --> 01:07:02.974
<v Speaker 1>Egan.</v>

2489
01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Who did you fight and Tencent and he was,</v>

2490
01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:06.161
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

2491
01:07:06.161 --> 01:07:10.000
<v Speaker 1>And he's beating him and they stopped the fight and YG and jumped into the ring</v>

2492
01:07:10.001 --> 01:07:14.680
<v Speaker 1>and started attacking Frank Shamrock when Frank Frank stopped answering with a</v>

2493
01:07:14.681 --> 01:07:19.681
<v Speaker 1>bunch of needs to face and then Egan jumped frank like now if that was a flat</v>

2494
01:07:20.261 --> 01:07:20.920
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>

2495
01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:21.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2496
01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:21.910
<v Speaker 1>and not,</v>

2497
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:22.950
<v Speaker 1>not like a,</v>

2498
01:07:22.951 --> 01:07:23.890
<v Speaker 1>it could be a me laying,</v>

2499
01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:24.970
<v Speaker 1>it can be chaos.</v>

2500
01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:25.121
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2501
01:07:25.121 --> 01:07:28.940
<v Speaker 1>he talking about royal rumble and then you got to charge more with basketball.</v>

2502
01:07:29.350 --> 01:07:30.280
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times at the end,</v>

2503
01:07:30.281 --> 01:07:32.550
<v Speaker 1>people run on the court calls.</v>

2504
01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:33.573
<v Speaker 1>Never Mba.</v>

2505
01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:34.210
<v Speaker 1>Mba,</v>

2506
01:07:34.210 --> 01:07:36.000
<v Speaker 1>you can't get on the court security.</v>

2507
01:07:36.070 --> 01:07:37.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's going to be a problem.</v>

2508
01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:38.020
<v Speaker 1>Many of them.</v>

2509
01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:38.853
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

2510
01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:39.341
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

2511
01:07:39.341 --> 01:07:40.750
<v Speaker 1>we've got to just trash to plan ahead.</v>

2512
01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:41.870
<v Speaker 1>We got bigger fish to fry fish.</v>

2513
01:07:41.890 --> 01:07:43.840
<v Speaker 1>The bigger fish forgiveness thing,</v>

2514
01:07:43.841 --> 01:07:45.570
<v Speaker 1>sanctioned buying a stadium.</v>

2515
01:07:46.030 --> 01:07:46.863
<v Speaker 1>We go to,</v>

2516
01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:49.360
<v Speaker 1>we go to somewhere that's conservation.</v>

2517
01:07:49.390 --> 01:07:51.700
<v Speaker 1>You could make your own rules at any of her as restoration,</v>

2518
01:07:52.070 --> 01:07:52.903
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2519
01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:56.831
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they changed.</v>

2520
01:07:56.831 --> 01:07:57.011
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2521
01:07:57.011 --> 01:07:57.844
<v Speaker 1>we can.</v>

2522
01:07:58.330 --> 01:07:58.901
<v Speaker 1>They can.</v>

2523
01:07:58.901 --> 01:08:01.030
<v Speaker 1>They can do whatever the fuck they want to pay them.</v>

2524
01:08:01.031 --> 01:08:01.720
<v Speaker 1>A nice royal.</v>

2525
01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:04.150
<v Speaker 1>They have crazy rules like here's the thing that they,</v>

2526
01:08:04.151 --> 01:08:05.950
<v Speaker 1>that drives some people nuts.</v>

2527
01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:09.610
<v Speaker 1>They can hunt whatever they want whenever they want a hunted and they can do</v>

2528
01:08:09.611 --> 01:08:10.830
<v Speaker 1>whatever method they want,</v>

2529
01:08:10.831 --> 01:08:14.200
<v Speaker 1>like the Indians and Canada that you spotlights to hunt Moose.</v>

2530
01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:16.220
<v Speaker 1>They shine at night on the Moose.</v>

2531
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:17.780
<v Speaker 3>The Moose don't know what the fuck's going on.</v>

2532
01:08:17.781 --> 01:08:18.171
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

2533
01:08:18.171 --> 01:08:19.910
<v Speaker 3>They blast him from the back of Atvs.</v>

2534
01:08:20.150 --> 01:08:22.640
<v Speaker 3>They do all this different shit that you're not allowed to do.</v>

2535
01:08:22.641 --> 01:08:24.420
<v Speaker 3>If you're a regular person,</v>

2536
01:08:24.421 --> 01:08:24.770
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

2537
01:08:24.770 --> 01:08:25.011
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2538
01:08:25.011 --> 01:08:25.281
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

2539
01:08:25.281 --> 01:08:25.910
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2540
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:26.780
<v Speaker 3>but if you're a ne,</v>

2541
01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:27.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean it doesn't matter if you're white.</v>

2542
01:08:27.891 --> 01:08:28.521
<v Speaker 3>If you're a black guy,</v>

2543
01:08:28.521 --> 01:08:29.300
<v Speaker 3>you're not allowed to do it.</v>

2544
01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:31.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying if you're not one of the first natives,</v>

2545
01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:33.440
<v Speaker 3>it made the call the first nation.</v>

2546
01:08:33.730 --> 01:08:34.563
<v Speaker 3>First nation.</v>

2547
01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:35.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2548
01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:35.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2549
01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:37.010
<v Speaker 3>I was total sorta,</v>

2550
01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:37.801
<v Speaker 3>whoa bro.</v>

2551
01:08:37.801 --> 01:08:40.340
<v Speaker 3>He's a thing like how far are we going back?</v>

2552
01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:44.030
<v Speaker 3>Because it wasn't their land when it was covering two miles of ice.</v>

2553
01:08:44.150 --> 01:08:44.421
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2554
01:08:44.421 --> 01:08:46.170
<v Speaker 3>That was just 10,000 years old once land.</v>

2555
01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:46.941
<v Speaker 3>But exactly.</v>

2556
01:08:46.941 --> 01:08:49.580
<v Speaker 3>So who's to say that like human land?</v>

2557
01:08:49.610 --> 01:08:49.941
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2558
01:08:49.941 --> 01:08:52.220
<v Speaker 3>who knows how it was set out?</v>

2559
01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:56.570
<v Speaker 3>Who knows who conquered who to establish their domain in that like to share</v>

2560
01:08:56.571 --> 01:08:57.080
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>

2561
01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:58.490
<v Speaker 3>before anybody who is,</v>

2562
01:08:58.640 --> 01:08:59.473
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2563
01:08:59.650 --> 01:09:01.520
<v Speaker 3>try not before the native Americans,</v>

2564
01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:01.921
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>

2565
01:09:01.921 --> 01:09:02.990
<v Speaker 3>not for the native Americans.</v>

2566
01:09:03.170 --> 01:09:05.540
<v Speaker 3>Native Americans were here from fucking Siberia,</v>

2567
01:09:06.850 --> 01:09:07.880
<v Speaker 3>but established too.</v>

2568
01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:08.953
<v Speaker 3>They all gone,</v>

2569
01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:10.310
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

2570
01:09:10.310 --> 01:09:11.600
<v Speaker 3>But they all wandered here.</v>

2571
01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:11.931
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

2572
01:09:11.931 --> 01:09:14.390
<v Speaker 3>the thing is they know exactly.</v>

2573
01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:15.140
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>

2574
01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:20.140
<v Speaker 3>the reality is we are feeling terrible as people that inherited this beautiful</v>

2575
01:09:20.751 --> 01:09:25.751
<v Speaker 3>place called Los Angeles from some barbarians that at one point in time took it</v>

2576
01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:28.490
<v Speaker 3>from some other people that were here first.</v>

2577
01:09:28.491 --> 01:09:28.611
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2578
01:09:28.611 --> 01:09:30.520
<v Speaker 3>that's really what oil bad for the dinosaur.</v>

2579
01:09:30.530 --> 01:09:32.960
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have anything to do with the people that are there right now.</v>

2580
01:09:32.961 --> 01:09:33.681
<v Speaker 3>That's my point.</v>

2581
01:09:33.681 --> 01:09:35.540
<v Speaker 3>The people that are in those reservations right now,</v>

2582
01:09:35.750 --> 01:09:39.260
<v Speaker 3>they didn't get anything stolen from them and they were born in 1968 you know</v>

2583
01:09:39.261 --> 01:09:39.890
<v Speaker 3>what I'm saying?</v>

2584
01:09:39.890 --> 01:09:42.320
<v Speaker 3>It's like the whole thing is squirrely that you're allowing them to have</v>

2585
01:09:42.321 --> 01:09:43.154
<v Speaker 3>casinos.</v>

2586
01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:44.360
<v Speaker 3>They gonna have cage fights,</v>

2587
01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:46.670
<v Speaker 3>negative rooster fights with fucking nuclear weapons attached.</v>

2588
01:09:46.690 --> 01:09:47.523
<v Speaker 3>Their beaks.</v>

2589
01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:52.850
<v Speaker 3>Ian's allowed to crosswalk with just like flashing and ID.</v>

2590
01:09:52.850 --> 01:09:54.290
<v Speaker 3>They don't get checked or anything like that.</v>

2591
01:09:54.291 --> 01:09:54.980
<v Speaker 3>I'd wonder,</v>

2592
01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:55.813
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2593
01:09:55.850 --> 01:09:56.630
<v Speaker 3>Mexico,</v>

2594
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.931
<v Speaker 3>India,</v>

2595
01:09:56.931 --> 01:10:00.290
<v Speaker 3>Canada and the states and into Mexico back and forth.</v>

2596
01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:01.181
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2597
01:10:01.181 --> 01:10:02.014
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

2598
01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:06.590
<v Speaker 3>It's really odd that they're allowed to just have casinos and just,</v>

2599
01:10:06.930 --> 01:10:10.040
<v Speaker 3>and they also make partnerships with people who aren't native,</v>

2600
01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:10.911
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2601
01:10:10.911 --> 01:10:13.230
<v Speaker 3>And then those guys profit off these casinos too.</v>

2602
01:10:13.231 --> 01:10:15.080
<v Speaker 3>It's like you get a stipend from the government.</v>

2603
01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:15.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

01:10:17.481 --> 01:10:19.340
<v Speaker 3>I did an appearance at an Indian reservation.</v>

2608

<v Speaker 3>Full body tattooed.</v>

2613
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:29.060
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it crazy too that you still call them Indians?</v>

2614
01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:32.210
<v Speaker 3>Like that was a mistake like they were supposed to be.</v>

2615
01:10:32.211 --> 01:10:33.950
<v Speaker 3>They thought they were in India.</v>

2616
01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:35.770

<v Speaker 1>probably companion.</v>

2674
01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:33.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

2675
01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:34.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I'm doing.</v>

2676
01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:35.251
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2677
01:12:35.251 --> 01:12:36.210
<v Speaker 1>if you're not commentating,</v>

2678
01:12:36.211 --> 01:12:38.310
<v Speaker 1>we need to do like giant companion for it.</v>

2679
01:12:38.311 --> 01:12:40.740
<v Speaker 1>And that was celebrate the shit out of it.</v>

2680
01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:42.000
<v Speaker 1>I would prefer that.</v>

2681
01:12:42.001 --> 01:12:42.690
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>

2682
01:12:42.690 --> 01:12:47.310
<v Speaker 1>June 10th June 10th it's about to get a lot of my man Mayweather throws you that</v>

2683
01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:48.390
<v Speaker 1>TMT money.</v>

2684
01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:49.590
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

2685
01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:51.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they really care about me commentating.</v>

2686
01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:53.490
<v Speaker 1>They'd probably want Max Kellerman or of the boxing people.</v>

2687
01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:56.820
<v Speaker 1>Max Kellerman you it would be fun.</v>

2688
01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:57.840
<v Speaker 1>I would love to do it with them,</v>

2689
01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:58.980
<v Speaker 1>but that's what I,</v>

2690
01:12:58.981 --> 01:12:59.281
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2691
01:12:59.281 --> 01:13:00.750
<v Speaker 1>that's boxing match.</v>

2692
01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:01.231
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2693
01:13:01.231 --> 01:13:02.710
<v Speaker 1>that's their world has been,</v>

2694
01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:03.950
<v Speaker 1>if it was an MMA match though,</v>

2695
01:13:04.050 --> 01:13:06.510
<v Speaker 1>and he was sitting down next to me doing commentary,</v>

2696
01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:07.310
<v Speaker 1>you know that,</v>

2697
01:13:07.310 --> 01:13:09.060
<v Speaker 1>I think that would be a little odd to not,</v>

2698
01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:11.670
<v Speaker 1>not a Floyd was just doing boxing the octagon.</v>

2699
01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:12.620
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2700
01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:13.770
<v Speaker 1>You need can be an awesome,</v>

2701
01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:14.551
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

2702
01:13:14.551 --> 01:13:14.711
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2703
01:13:14.711 --> 01:13:14.750
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2704
01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:17.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying if the roles were reversed,</v>

2705
01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:20.450
<v Speaker 1>I think you could talk about moving Connor's history cause they,</v>

2706
01:13:20.490 --> 01:13:21.420
<v Speaker 1>they're not giving a shit.</v>

2707
01:13:21.421 --> 01:13:22.230
<v Speaker 1>Let's be real.</v>

2708
01:13:22.230 --> 01:13:22.861
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be like,</v>

2709
01:13:22.861 --> 01:13:24.810
<v Speaker 1>you know Shannon Sharpe talking about UFC.</v>

2710
01:13:24.811 --> 01:13:25.980
<v Speaker 1>It's tough to listen to.</v>

2711
01:13:26.350 --> 01:13:28.110
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be good at someone who's knowledgeable.</v>

2712
01:13:28.230 --> 01:13:30.060
<v Speaker 1>Breakdown like commerce history,</v>

2713
01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:31.013
<v Speaker 1>how he came here.</v>

2714
01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.070
<v Speaker 1>He got his movement.</v>

2715
01:13:32.071 --> 01:13:33.090
<v Speaker 1>What he's known for.</v>

2716
01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:35.250
<v Speaker 1>I think that's super important.</v>

2717
01:13:35.251 --> 01:13:37.370
<v Speaker 1>You have to have people who don't watch UFC.</v>

2718
01:13:37.371 --> 01:13:39.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah cause you're getting a shit load of new boxing.</v>

2719
01:13:39.570 --> 01:13:40.271
<v Speaker 1>You know it sounds bad.</v>

2720
01:13:40.271 --> 01:13:40.980
<v Speaker 1>It's tune in,</v>

2721
01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:41.910
<v Speaker 1>hanging out with you guys.</v>

2722
01:13:41.911 --> 01:13:42.541
<v Speaker 1>Smoking weed,</v>

2723
01:13:42.541 --> 01:13:43.351
<v Speaker 1>watching it right here.</v>

2724
01:13:43.351 --> 01:13:44.610
<v Speaker 1>That's how it's so much better.</v>

2725
01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:46.890
<v Speaker 1>I just want my dear friend Joe Rogan,</v>

2726
01:13:46.891 --> 01:13:48.570
<v Speaker 1>part of the biggest fight of combat and history.</v>

2727
01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:49.413
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

2728
01:13:50.010 --> 01:13:51.480
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see a big deal right here.</v>

2729
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:53.860
<v Speaker 1>Cause you don't think that's the biggest fight in his life.</v>

2730
01:13:54.150 --> 01:13:58.790
<v Speaker 1>The biggest fight in history bigger than Ali Frazier number wise.</v>

2731
01:13:58.791 --> 01:13:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2732
01:13:59.040 --> 01:13:59.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2733
01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:02.640
<v Speaker 1>It's a big paper view ever because it brings in two worlds.</v>

2734
01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:06.150
<v Speaker 1>It brings in the UFC world and this one guy who was unquestionably the biggest</v>

2735
01:14:06.151 --> 01:14:06.870
<v Speaker 1>star in the UFC,</v>

2736
01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:09.600
<v Speaker 1>unquestionably by a long shot,</v>

2737
01:14:09.810 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 1>and then you bring in a guy has been</v>

2738
01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:14.740
<v Speaker 3>one of the biggest money makers in the history of boxing game,</v>

2739
01:14:14.770 --> 01:14:17.680
<v Speaker 3>the only guy to go 49 and no others in rocky Marciano.</v>

2740
01:14:18.130 --> 01:14:18.431
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2741
01:14:18.431 --> 01:14:22.180
<v Speaker 3>he's like right there and we'd love to break rocky Marciano's record and then</v>

2742
01:14:22.181 --> 01:14:22.961
<v Speaker 3>you know what man,</v>

2743
01:14:22.961 --> 01:14:26.740
<v Speaker 3>when people want to do things like break someone's record and you want to do it</v>

2744
01:14:26.741 --> 01:14:30.640
<v Speaker 3>so bad that you take on a guy who's never had a boxing match before and then</v>

2745
01:14:30.641 --> 01:14:31.840
<v Speaker 3>that guy starches you,</v>

2746
01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:33.773
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

2747
01:14:34.350 --> 01:14:34.991
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2748
01:14:34.991 --> 01:14:36.040
<v Speaker 3>it's not like that.</v>

2749
01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:37.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to build a shrine to him,</v>

2750
01:14:37.721 --> 01:14:38.640
<v Speaker 3>pray to whatever it is.</v>

2751
01:14:38.641 --> 01:14:39.540
<v Speaker 3>Some of them,</v>

2752
01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:40.481
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2753
01:14:40.481 --> 01:14:41.141
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you,</v>

2754
01:14:41.141 --> 01:14:42.370
<v Speaker 3>there's something about that dude.</v>

2755
01:14:42.371 --> 01:14:43.720
<v Speaker 3>He's got something going on.</v>

2756
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:44.231
<v Speaker 3>Magic.</v>

2757
01:14:44.231 --> 01:14:46.120
<v Speaker 3>He's got a little something extra special,</v>

2758
01:14:46.121 --> 01:14:46.954
<v Speaker 3>but he would need,</v>

2759
01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:48.940
<v Speaker 3>he would need everything to line up.</v>

2760
01:14:48.970 --> 01:14:52.480
<v Speaker 3>It would have to be the McGregor Mayweather.</v>

2761
01:14:52.481 --> 01:14:55.150
<v Speaker 3>It would have to dismiss him as a threat.</v>

2762
01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:57.010
<v Speaker 3>He'd have to not train hard enough,</v>

2763
01:14:57.190 --> 01:15:00.520
<v Speaker 3>hit up to not seriously consider the possibility that Connor connects on him and</v>

2764
01:15:00.521 --> 01:15:01.354
<v Speaker 3>knocks him out.</v>

2765
01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:02.140
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2766
01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:05.170
<v Speaker 3>And then kind of would have to do some rough housing.</v>

2767
01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:07.150
<v Speaker 3>He would have to hold it and get clench.</v>

2768
01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:09.210
<v Speaker 3>He'd have to hold them and hit 'em.</v>

2769
01:15:09.450 --> 01:15:12.970
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to try to get off as many shots and bullying around and wear him out</v>

2770
01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:14.230
<v Speaker 3>to a possibility.</v>

2771
01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:15.190
<v Speaker 3>It's a possibility.</v>

2772
01:15:15.191 --> 01:15:16.720
<v Speaker 3>He's a much bigger mass.</v>

2773
01:15:16.990 --> 01:15:18.720
<v Speaker 3>He's a much bigger man.</v>

2774
01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:19.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2775
01:15:19.690 --> 01:15:20.021
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

2776
01:15:20.021 --> 01:15:20.561
<v Speaker 3>very quick.</v>

2777
01:15:20.561 --> 01:15:22.480
<v Speaker 3>But if you compare the two of them frame wise,</v>

2778
01:15:22.481 --> 01:15:26.440
<v Speaker 3>like what if they ever do do it and they're standing right at each other looking</v>

2779
01:15:26.441 --> 01:15:27.274
<v Speaker 3>down at each other,</v>

2780
01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:27.461
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2781
01:15:27.461 --> 01:15:28.211
<v Speaker 3>do an eye to eye.</v>

2782
01:15:28.211 --> 01:15:28.720
<v Speaker 3>You're going to go,</v>

2783
01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:29.560
<v Speaker 3>oh shit.</v>

2784
01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:29.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2785
01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:30.760
<v Speaker 3>Connor's way.</v>

2786
01:15:30.761 --> 01:15:33.730
<v Speaker 3>Because you remember when Eddie Alvarez was going Idi with Connor and you</v>

2787
01:15:33.731 --> 01:15:35.140
<v Speaker 3>realize how big Connor's head is.</v>

2788
01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:36.223
<v Speaker 3>He like Jesus,</v>

2789
01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:38.530
<v Speaker 3>just a bigger dude cause I'm shoulders,</v>

2790
01:15:38.531 --> 01:15:39.430
<v Speaker 3>his legs.</v>

2791
01:15:39.670 --> 01:15:40.810
<v Speaker 3>He's a big fuck.</v>

2792
01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:44.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean he could make that 145 pound cut when he's on death's door,</v>

2793
01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:46.060
<v Speaker 3>but may whether it makes it easy,</v>

2794
01:15:46.061 --> 01:15:48.580
<v Speaker 3>what are they going to fight at 45 that's a good question.</v>

2795
01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:49.210
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2796
01:15:49.210 --> 01:15:51.780
<v Speaker 3>maybe there was fighting at one 54 his last two fights.</v>

2797
01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:54.790
<v Speaker 3>I bet they do it like 55 or 60 maybe.</v>

2798
01:15:54.910 --> 01:15:57.560
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it depends on what may was comfortable with it,</v>

2799
01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:58.630
<v Speaker 3>but I think the,</v>

2800
01:15:58.910 --> 01:15:59.710
<v Speaker 3>in Dana Light,</v>

2801
01:15:59.710 --> 01:16:01.300
<v Speaker 3>you want to be part of that fight.</v>

2802
01:16:01.301 --> 01:16:04.090
<v Speaker 3>If you're Dana let you want to be in cahoots with all these guys with</v>

2803
01:16:04.270 --> 01:16:05.230
<v Speaker 3>Mayweather,</v>

2804
01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:05.770
<v Speaker 3>Floyd,</v>

2805
01:16:05.770 --> 01:16:09.460
<v Speaker 3>or don't want the fight to take place at all and book.</v>

2806
01:16:09.461 --> 01:16:10.091
<v Speaker 3>He's got the,</v>

2807
01:16:10.091 --> 01:16:11.920
<v Speaker 3>he got fucked because number Grumet off,</v>

2808
01:16:11.921 --> 01:16:12.754
<v Speaker 3>got sick,</v>

2809
01:16:12.850 --> 01:16:13.690
<v Speaker 3>making that weight.</v>

2810
01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:15.280
<v Speaker 3>If number get Madoff didn't get sick,</v>

2811
01:16:15.281 --> 01:16:16.114
<v Speaker 3>making that weight.</v>

2812
01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:18.610
<v Speaker 3>Then neuroma Madoff and Tony Ferguson,</v>

2813
01:16:18.970 --> 01:16:19.780
<v Speaker 3>Dana White did.</v>

2814
01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:21.550
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

2815
01:16:21.570 --> 01:16:23.170
<v Speaker 3>the UFC did because look,</v>

2816
01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:26.190
<v Speaker 3>the real fight is the winner of her.</v>

2817
01:16:26.530 --> 01:16:28.190
<v Speaker 3>Tony Ferguson and Habib number,</v>

2818
01:16:28.191 --> 01:16:29.170
<v Speaker 3>good metal in the UFC.</v>

2819
01:16:29.190 --> 01:16:29.451
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2820
01:16:29.451 --> 01:16:32.650
<v Speaker 3>So that's the real fight is like being a big challenge for Conor and that could</v>

2821
01:16:32.651 --> 01:16:33.720
<v Speaker 3>be a million plus papers.</v>

2822
01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:34.560
<v Speaker 3>The purest.</v>

2823
01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:35.393
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2824
01:16:35.610 --> 01:16:36.820
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you,</v>

2825
01:16:36.821 --> 01:16:41.110
<v Speaker 3>if you either have that fight or the better fight financially is another fight</v>

2826
01:16:41.111 --> 01:16:41.860
<v Speaker 3>with Nate Diaz.</v>

2827
01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:42.071
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2828
01:16:42.071 --> 01:16:44.280
<v Speaker 3>the better fight financial is may with Oh yeah,</v>

2829
01:16:44.290 --> 01:16:45.720
<v Speaker 3>for box for sure.</v>

2830
01:16:45.721 --> 01:16:46.900
<v Speaker 3>The same for common or no,</v>

2831
01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:47.351
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

2832
01:16:47.351 --> 01:16:47.681
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

2833
01:16:47.681 --> 01:16:52.681
<v Speaker 3>Connor has a business that's by far the HUD 100% agree with what I was saying in</v>

2834
01:16:52.721 --> 01:16:55.260
<v Speaker 3>20 million weigh more than a hundred million.</v>

2835
01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:56.320
<v Speaker 3>A hundred by a hundred.</v>

2836
01:16:56.530 --> 01:16:58.540
<v Speaker 3>100 million each to Ray Borg.</v>

2837
01:16:58.570 --> 01:16:59.780
<v Speaker 3>Looks good as far he does.</v>

2838
01:16:59.950 --> 01:17:00.790
<v Speaker 3>He's so fast.</v>

2839
01:17:00.850 --> 01:17:01.310
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2840
01:17:01.310 --> 01:17:04.780
<v Speaker 3>w w well they a Khabib and Tony are going to fight again though,</v>

2841
01:17:04.781 --> 01:17:05.051
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2842
01:17:05.051 --> 01:17:05.884
<v Speaker 3>Aren't they?</v>

2843
01:17:07.210 --> 01:17:10.100
<v Speaker 3>But here's the thing that makes a bead might be able to make that weight</v>

2844
01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:11.360
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2845
01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:12.680
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2846
01:17:12.681 --> 01:17:16.310
<v Speaker 2>since Kelvin miss wait a couple of times and Dana forced him to fight it,</v>

2847
01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:17.203
<v Speaker 2>one 85,</v>

2848
01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:17.721
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2849
01:17:17.721 --> 01:17:18.890
<v Speaker 2>it makes sense to Dana goes,</v>

2850
01:17:18.891 --> 01:17:19.071
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

2851
01:17:19.071 --> 01:17:21.140
<v Speaker 2>you got to do one 70 at least once or twice,</v>

2852
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:24.770
<v Speaker 2>but we'll go up in weight to fight him.</v>

2853
01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:25.101
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2854
01:17:25.101 --> 01:17:26.240
<v Speaker 2>he only mess wait once,</v>

2855
01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:27.080
<v Speaker 2>twice,</v>

2856
01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:27.440
<v Speaker 2>twice,</v>

2857
01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:27.801
<v Speaker 2>twice,</v>

2858
01:17:27.801 --> 01:17:28.560
<v Speaker 2>twice.</v>

2859
01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:29.360
<v Speaker 2>Tonia huge.</v>

2860
01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:32.570
<v Speaker 2>55 minutes again against anybody's tall,</v>

2861
01:17:32.571 --> 01:17:33.404
<v Speaker 2>but he's not.</v>

2862
01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:38.050
<v Speaker 2>He's like Tony is like five ten five 11 okay.</v>

2863
01:17:38.150 --> 01:17:40.220
<v Speaker 2>Tony's built perfect for the division.</v>

2864
01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:40.450
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2865
01:17:40.450 --> 01:17:42.260
<v Speaker 2>Tom Freed up 50 he's got,</v>

2866
01:17:42.261 --> 01:17:43.460
<v Speaker 2>he's got a lot of muscle.</v>

2867
01:17:43.461 --> 01:17:44.510
<v Speaker 2>Even though he's long.</v>

2868
01:17:44.511 --> 01:17:45.770
<v Speaker 2>He's very strong.</v>

2869
01:17:45.771 --> 01:17:46.910
<v Speaker 2>He's excellent in the clinch.</v>

2870
01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:49.530
<v Speaker 2>I was looking forward to that fight so much.</v>

2871
01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:50.413
<v Speaker 2>My heart,</v>

2872
01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:52.250
<v Speaker 2>my how big it could be.</v>

2873
01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:53.550
<v Speaker 2>It could be got a huge frame.</v>

2874
01:17:53.551 --> 01:17:54.260
<v Speaker 2>It's a tank.</v>

2875
01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:54.471
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2876
01:17:54.471 --> 01:17:55.790
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't have a nutritionist.</v>

2877
01:17:55.810 --> 01:17:56.450
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't talk.</v>

2878
01:17:56.450 --> 01:17:56.841
<v Speaker 2>He's not,</v>

2879
01:17:56.841 --> 01:17:57.970
<v Speaker 2>you're not being professionals.</v>

2880
01:17:58.280 --> 01:17:58.951
<v Speaker 2>He's thick.</v>

2881
01:17:58.951 --> 01:18:02.450
<v Speaker 2>Could you hear what Tony Tony to get done and wondering when they're like doing</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2884
01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.480
<v Speaker 2>And it could be with saying something like,</v>

2885
01:18:05.481 --> 01:18:06.980
<v Speaker 2>why do you get your sunglasses on?</v>

2886
01:18:07.170 --> 01:18:08.750
<v Speaker 2>It's like 26 seven lunches and he's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>good luck or that weight cut.</v>

2888
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:10.131
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

01:18:10.131 --> 01:18:12.520
<v Speaker 2>I hear him breathing cause your cardio sucks.</v>

2890
01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:13.410

01:18:13.410 --> 01:18:14.570

2894
01:18:20.291 --> 01:18:21.710
<v Speaker 2>That interim title</v>

2897
01:18:25.610 --> 01:18:27.500
<v Speaker 2>We can't just fucking hang up at defy.</v>

2898
01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:30.950
<v Speaker 2>But don't you think that that's the fight that has to be made in that division,</v>

2899
01:18:30.951 --> 01:18:31.171
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2900
01:18:31.171 --> 01:18:32.004
<v Speaker 2>That's the right tone.</v>

2901
01:18:32.010 --> 01:18:32.391
<v Speaker 2>If it's,</v>

2902
01:18:32.391 --> 01:18:35.030
<v Speaker 2>but if he can't make one 55 can,</v>

2903
01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:36.820
<v Speaker 2>he needs to get real and get a fucking die?</v>

2904
01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:39.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what happened to him.</v>

2905
01:18:39.290 --> 01:18:41.150
<v Speaker 2>We don't eat Tiramisu the week of.</v>

2906
01:18:41.150 --> 01:18:45.720
<v Speaker 2>I know that he did that corn on embedded and Tony even tweet out like for sure</v>

2907
01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:47.360
<v Speaker 2>when fucking eat Tiramisu,</v>

2908
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:48.710
<v Speaker 2>he really ate Tiramisu.</v>

2909
01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:50.120
<v Speaker 2>It was on an embedded video.</v>

2910
01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:51.913
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

2911
01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:52.910
<v Speaker 2>That's how he smelled it.</v>

2912
01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:53.541
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

2913
01:18:53.541 --> 01:18:54.530
<v Speaker 2>have fun making weight.</v>

2914
01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:56.230
<v Speaker 2>Why are you helping him?</v>

2915
01:18:56.250 --> 01:18:57.083
<v Speaker 2>Puffin,</v>

2916
01:18:57.660 --> 01:18:59.460
<v Speaker 2>did you have to make that fight and to be,</v>

2917
01:18:59.470 --> 01:19:00.051
<v Speaker 2>you can do it.</v>

2918
01:19:00.051 --> 01:19:00.380
<v Speaker 2>He's just,</v>

2919
01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:01.580
<v Speaker 2>he's made it before,</v>

2920
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:05.150
<v Speaker 2>but we don't know what happened when he had to go to the fucking hospital.</v>

2921
01:19:05.151 --> 01:19:06.800
<v Speaker 2>They said he was in massive pain.</v>

2922
01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:08.130
<v Speaker 2>Like we also know he'd be like,</v>

2923
01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:09.001
<v Speaker 2>hold on a second day.</v>

2924
01:19:09.001 --> 01:19:10.250
<v Speaker 2>Luke Rockhold you're right.</v>

2925
01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:12.020
<v Speaker 2>But Luke Rockhold said something.</v>

2926
01:19:12.021 --> 01:19:13.940
<v Speaker 2>There was some quote that I had read.</v>

2927
01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:15.081
<v Speaker 2>God Damn it.</v>

2928
01:19:15.081 --> 01:19:15.531
<v Speaker 2>What did it see?</v>

2929
01:19:15.531 --> 01:19:15.770
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

2930
01:19:15.770 --> 01:19:17.420
<v Speaker 2>what they said about what,</v>

2931
01:19:17.421 --> 01:19:17.820
<v Speaker 2>what did,</v>

2932
01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:18.653
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2933
01:19:18.770 --> 01:19:19.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2934
01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:23.840
<v Speaker 2>bebes corner list as the official issue that was happening to him.</v>

2935
01:19:23.930 --> 01:19:25.430
<v Speaker 2>He was six pounds overweight,</v>

2936
01:19:25.431 --> 01:19:26.264
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2937
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:27.170
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2938
01:19:27.170 --> 01:19:28.370
<v Speaker 2>When he went to the hospitals.</v>

2939
01:19:28.371 --> 01:19:28.950
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

2940
01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:29.900
<v Speaker 2>that's huge.</v>

2941
01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:31.100
<v Speaker 2>That's so heavy.</v>

2942
01:19:31.490 --> 01:19:34.580
<v Speaker 2>You're so heavy when your body's your body shutting down,</v>

2943
01:19:34.730 --> 01:19:37.430
<v Speaker 2>like you're six pounds away and your body is shutting down.</v>

2944
01:19:37.810 --> 01:19:39.140
<v Speaker 2>Come in the week of the fight.</v>

2945
01:19:39.410 --> 01:19:39.711
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2946
01:19:39.711 --> 01:19:41.510
<v Speaker 2>But obviously fucked up with his,</v>

2947
01:19:41.511 --> 01:19:41.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2948
01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:44.180
<v Speaker 2>his discipline if he's eaten Tiramisu.</v>

2949
01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:45.051
<v Speaker 2>If that's true,</v>

2950
01:19:45.051 --> 01:19:46.190
<v Speaker 2>that's even more disappointing.</v>

2951
01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:47.240
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you just had a bite,</v>

2952
01:19:47.241 --> 01:19:50.210
<v Speaker 2>but either way you don't have a,</v>

2953
01:19:50.230 --> 01:19:51.220
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not saying it's the answer.</v>

2954
01:19:51.230 --> 01:19:53.900
<v Speaker 2>You don't have a mic dolce or one of these guys who are helping you with your</v>

2955
01:19:53.901 --> 01:19:54.171
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>

2956
01:19:54.171 --> 01:19:55.004
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2957
01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:57.430
<v Speaker 2>Tony's up and wait to find them.</v>

2958
01:19:57.780 --> 01:19:58.820
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense.</v>

2959
01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:00.140
<v Speaker 2>Can make sense for Tony.</v>

2960
01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:02.570
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense for Tony mean who wants to fight this guy?</v>

2961
01:20:02.571 --> 01:20:03.740
<v Speaker 2>But for the division,</v>

2962
01:20:03.741 --> 01:20:04.371
<v Speaker 2>it's so weird.</v>

2963
01:20:04.371 --> 01:20:04.581
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2964
01:20:04.581 --> 01:20:04.731
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2965
01:20:04.731 --> 01:20:05.031
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>

2966
01:20:05.031 --> 01:20:05.990
<v Speaker 2>it sucks the division.</v>

2967
01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:06.853
<v Speaker 2>What is this guys?</v>

2968
01:20:07.050 --> 01:20:07.930
<v Speaker 2>The whole</v>

2969
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:10.410
<v Speaker 3>fights bigger than what the division looks like.</v>

2970
01:20:10.411 --> 01:20:10.920
<v Speaker 3>That fight,</v>

2971
01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:11.970
<v Speaker 3>that fight needs to happen.</v>

2972
01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:12.833
<v Speaker 3>I agree too.</v>

2973
01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:13.291
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

2974
01:20:13.291 --> 01:20:14.124
<v Speaker 3>I agree with that.</v>

2975
01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:16.470
<v Speaker 3>That has all this other shit's going on.</v>

2976
01:20:16.471 --> 01:20:17.460
<v Speaker 3>Mayweather and Garner,</v>

2977
01:20:17.461 --> 01:20:18.230

2986
01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:28.050
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't say what the issue is.</v>

2987
01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:29.550
<v Speaker 3>This the official us.</v>

01:20:31.081 --> 01:20:34.980
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I read an article that was interviewing Luke Rockhold.</v>

2991
01:20:34.981 --> 01:20:39.810
<v Speaker 3>Rockhold was talking about what happened to the [inaudible] Dot Gov you see Dana</v>

<v Speaker 3>if you were to,</v>

2996
01:20:41.370 --> 01:20:42.900
<v Speaker 3>we maybe could assist drinking.</v>

2997
01:20:42.901 --> 01:20:43.860
<v Speaker 3>Who gave him a beer?</v>

2998
01:20:43.890 --> 01:20:44.723
<v Speaker 3>This isn't beer.</v>

2999
01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:45.713
<v Speaker 3>What is it</v>

3000
01:20:47.330 --> 01:20:49.190
<v Speaker 3>that bear fruit?</v>

3001
01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:51.970
<v Speaker 3>So someone gave the Gremlin water after men.</v>

3002
01:20:54.180 --> 01:20:54.650
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3003
01:20:54.650 --> 01:20:56.580
<v Speaker 3>but Dana was saying he panics.</v>

3004
01:20:57.390 --> 01:20:58.750
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

3005
01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:00.753
<v Speaker 3>oh</v>

3007
01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:09.780
<v Speaker 3>You can't leave a guy drinking by himself.</v>

3008
01:21:09.781 --> 01:21:12.420
<v Speaker 3>That was the moment the wheels fell off the podcast.</v>

3009
01:21:12.421 --> 01:21:12.721
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3010
01:21:12.721 --> 01:21:13.171
<v Speaker 3>here it is.</v>

3011
01:21:13.171 --> 01:21:14.004
<v Speaker 3>This is what I read.</v>

3012
01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:16.680
<v Speaker 3>Habib wasn't getting any blood to his liver.</v>

3013
01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:18.450
<v Speaker 3>This is what Luke Rockhold says.</v>

3014
01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:19.290
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

3015
01:21:19.290 --> 01:21:21.870
<v Speaker 3>that is fucking real bad.</v>

3016
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:23.550
<v Speaker 3>So scroll down and let's,</v>

3017
01:21:23.551 --> 01:21:24.384
<v Speaker 3>let's see what Luke,</v>

3018
01:21:24.890 --> 01:21:27.900
<v Speaker 3>it says the weight cut wasn't going very well.</v>

3019
01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:28.311
<v Speaker 3>Could be,</v>

3020
01:21:28.311 --> 01:21:32.040
<v Speaker 3>was complaining about a pain in his side and we had to cut short the weight cut</v>

3021
01:21:32.041 --> 01:21:34.680
<v Speaker 3>and sure enough it gets worse over night and had to go to the hospital.</v>

3022
01:21:35.010 --> 01:21:37.860
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately this is the fight is really fucking four Bababa from what I</v>

3023
01:21:37.861 --> 01:21:38.311
<v Speaker 3>understand,</v>

3024
01:21:38.311 --> 01:21:40.860
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't getting any blood to his liver and something went wrong with his</v>

3025
01:21:40.861 --> 01:21:41.460
<v Speaker 3>weight cut.</v>

3026
01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:43.110
<v Speaker 3>It's very similar to his last fight.</v>

3027
01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:45.360
<v Speaker 3>What I understand and just something went wrong.</v>

3028
01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:46.680
<v Speaker 3>You never know what these weight cuts,</v>

3029
01:21:46.681 --> 01:21:47.101
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>

3030
01:21:47.101 --> 01:21:49.560
<v Speaker 3>but I think he's ready to go and we can rebook this.</v>

3031
01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:51.510
<v Speaker 3>What is,</v>

3032
01:21:51.511 --> 01:21:52.670
<v Speaker 3>he was wrong.</v>

3033
01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:54.120
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3034
01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:55.230
<v Speaker 3>he's a training partner.</v>

3035
01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:58.290
<v Speaker 3>He's a Aka a hundred pounds heavier training partner.</v>

3036
01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:00.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3037
01:22:00.890 --> 01:22:02.400
<v Speaker 3>Well from the same gym.</v>

3038
01:22:02.430 --> 01:22:02.850
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3039
01:22:02.850 --> 01:22:04.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean it obviously ain't a hundred pounds.</v>

3040
01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:07.290
<v Speaker 3>He's a big walk around that.</v>

3041
01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:09.390
<v Speaker 3>It could be shit.</v>

3042
01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:10.673
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno.</v>

3043
01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:11.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to misspeak.</v>

3044
01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:14.160
<v Speaker 3>I'd assume high seventies yeah,</v>

3045
01:22:14.370 --> 01:22:14.911
<v Speaker 3>it looks like it.</v>

3046
01:22:14.911 --> 01:22:15.360
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3047
01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:16.260
<v Speaker 3>And he ain't fat.</v>

3048
01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:16.860
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3049
01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:18.090
<v Speaker 3>they gotta make that fight,</v>

3050
01:22:18.091 --> 01:22:18.840
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3051
01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:19.673
<v Speaker 3>That's the fight.</v>

3052
01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:20.780
<v Speaker 3>I'd say that's the Madison.</v>

3053
01:22:20.781 --> 01:22:21.870
<v Speaker 3>If there'd been when the fight fell through,</v>

3054
01:22:21.871 --> 01:22:23.730
<v Speaker 3>like when John and chill thing.</v>

3055
01:22:23.731 --> 01:22:24.630
<v Speaker 3>I really wasn't that math.</v>

3056
01:22:24.631 --> 01:22:25.680
<v Speaker 3>There's been other fights.</v>

3057
01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:26.070
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3058
01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:28.350
<v Speaker 3>John D C I wasn't that upset.</v>

3059
01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:28.921
<v Speaker 3>This one.</v>

3060
01:22:28.921 --> 01:22:30.120
<v Speaker 3>I was pissed man.</v>

3061
01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:33.510
<v Speaker 3>I was really upset telling me what fine his camp,</v>

3062
01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:34.890
<v Speaker 3>everything was perfect.</v>

3063
01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:36.700
<v Speaker 3>It was on such a good fighter.</v>

3064
01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:38.250
<v Speaker 3>Now tell me,</v>

3065
01:22:38.251 --> 01:22:38.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3066
01:22:38.610 --> 01:22:39.870
<v Speaker 3>if you're allowed to speak about this,</v>

3067
01:22:39.871 --> 01:22:40.561
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you are,</v>

3068
01:22:40.561 --> 01:22:43.920
<v Speaker 3>but there's been a lot of complaints about his pay.</v>

3069
01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:44.831
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>

3070
01:22:44.831 --> 01:22:45.121
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

3071
01:22:45.121 --> 01:22:48.720
<v Speaker 3>what exactly did happen if you could clarify what you were training him.</v>

3072
01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:51.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the specifics.</v>

3073
01:22:51.410 --> 01:22:52.243
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3074
01:22:52.460 --> 01:22:56.160
<v Speaker 3>cause I heard he was very upset that whatever and reading was that he was very</v>

3075
01:22:56.161 --> 01:22:58.230
<v Speaker 3>upset that he wasn't even getting show money.</v>

3076
01:22:58.890 --> 01:22:59.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to say like,</v>

3077
01:22:59.851 --> 01:23:00.211
<v Speaker 3>if it's,</v>

3078
01:23:00.211 --> 01:23:00.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3079
01:23:00.990 --> 01:23:01.650
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

3080
01:23:01.650 --> 01:23:05.010
<v Speaker 3>if you were getting 10,000 to show 10,000 to,</v>

3081
01:23:05.890 --> 01:23:06.280
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

3082
01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:08.350
<v Speaker 2>you made weight and your opponent doesn't make wait,</v>

3083
01:23:09.130 --> 01:23:10.180
<v Speaker 2>just give them the show money.</v>

3084
01:23:10.181 --> 01:23:10.900
<v Speaker 2>It's 10 k,</v>

3085
01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:15.900
<v Speaker 2>but when it's like big money and your opponent can't make weight than we're not</v>

3086
01:23:16.961 --> 01:23:18.370
<v Speaker 2>going to give you the whole host.</v>

3087
01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:19.473
<v Speaker 2>All that money.</v>

3088
01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:20.473
<v Speaker 2>Kind of like that.</v>

3089
01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:24.070
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it should be insured and that's why it's confusing to me.</v>

3090
01:23:24.270 --> 01:23:26.350
<v Speaker 2>Then I totally down,</v>

3091
01:23:26.410 --> 01:23:27.141
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly what,</v>

3092
01:23:27.141 --> 01:23:28.480
<v Speaker 2>and I know there was that issue.</v>

3093
01:23:28.481 --> 01:23:29.800
<v Speaker 2>Will he still get that show money?</v>

3094
01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:32.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he got it or he got half or something like that.</v>

3095
01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:32.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't really like,</v>

3096
01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:34.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't really get into it with</v>

3097
01:23:36.250 --> 01:23:36.670
<v Speaker 2>Tony.</v>

3098
01:23:36.670 --> 01:23:39.610
<v Speaker 2>Tony's right on that cause he did all the necessary steps.</v>

3099
01:23:39.611 --> 01:23:40.750
<v Speaker 2>You went through training camp.</v>

3100
01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:41.441
<v Speaker 2>It's not his fault.</v>

3101
01:23:41.441 --> 01:23:42.900
<v Speaker 2>Could beep didn't fucking make,</v>

3102
01:23:43.450 --> 01:23:44.380
<v Speaker 2>he suffers from it.</v>

3103
01:23:44.410 --> 01:23:45.243
<v Speaker 2>You can't have that.</v>

3104
01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:48.070
<v Speaker 2>If a fighter doesn't make the other fighters should be,</v>

3105
01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:48.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>

3106
01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:49.240
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3107
01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:49.610
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

3108
01:23:49.610 --> 01:23:50.350
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was,</v>

3109
01:23:50.350 --> 01:23:51.790
<v Speaker 2>maybe it was a deal like this or something.</v>

3110
01:23:51.791 --> 01:23:52.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

3111
01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:53.193
<v Speaker 2>but maybe it was a deal.</v>

3112
01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:58.320
<v Speaker 2>We can get you to 50 to show and on whatever to win or something like that.</v>

3113
01:23:58.781 --> 01:23:59.614
<v Speaker 2>Some big,</v>

3114
01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:00.940
<v Speaker 2>but we're offering that.</v>

3115
01:24:00.970 --> 01:24:01.990
<v Speaker 2>If the fight happens,</v>

3116
01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:05.030
<v Speaker 2>if for some reason your opponent in small print at,</v>

3117
01:24:05.130 --> 01:24:06.250
<v Speaker 2>doesn't that make the fight,</v>

3118
01:24:06.251 --> 01:24:07.180
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to get that show money.</v>

3119
01:24:07.210 --> 01:24:08.380
<v Speaker 2>It's like if the fight happened,</v>

3120
01:24:08.381 --> 01:24:09.250
<v Speaker 2>I feel like maybe after,</v>

3121
01:24:09.290 --> 01:24:09.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3122
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:13.120
<v Speaker 2>UFC would be smart on their end to structure some of them.</v>

3123
01:24:13.121 --> 01:24:13.900
<v Speaker 2>They need a guarantee.</v>

3124
01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:14.950
<v Speaker 2>Guarantee person you'd</v>

3125
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:15.471
<v Speaker 1>see better.</v>

3126
01:24:15.471 --> 01:24:19.460
<v Speaker 1>Five feel like you need to make a person who does not make the weight get a</v>

3127
01:24:19.461 --> 01:24:20.294
<v Speaker 1>loss.</v>

3128
01:24:20.690 --> 01:24:22.790
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think fucking insane.</v>

3129
01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:23.870
<v Speaker 1>Feel.</v>

3130
01:24:23.870 --> 01:24:24.830
<v Speaker 1>It gets a loss.</v>

3131
01:24:24.831 --> 01:24:27.900
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like there's no fight and I feel like the other guy gets paid.</v>

3132
01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:29.540
<v Speaker 1>There's only one way to stop it.</v>

3133
01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:31.280
<v Speaker 1>You've got to punish people.</v>

3134
01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:32.230
<v Speaker 1>Tony's going to make it.</v>

3135
01:24:32.550 --> 01:24:33.320
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3136
01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:33.620
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

3137
01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:36.320
<v Speaker 1>we gotta make it a loss because the fighter didn't make weight.</v>

3138
01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:37.193
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

3139
01:24:37.350 --> 01:24:39.020
<v Speaker 1>Why do you have four glasses there?</v>

3140
01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:39.973
<v Speaker 1>One drink?</v>

3141
01:24:41.730 --> 01:24:41.960
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3142
01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:42.021
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3143
01:24:42.021 --> 01:24:42.320
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3144
01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:42.561
<v Speaker 1>Here's,</v>

3145
01:24:42.561 --> 01:24:45.170
<v Speaker 1>you already had a beer gremlins.</v>

3146
01:24:45.410 --> 01:24:46.250
<v Speaker 1>You remember the movie?</v>

3147
01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:47.750
<v Speaker 1>He give the little cute things.</v>

3148
01:24:47.751 --> 01:24:49.770
<v Speaker 1>Water Callen determine the devils.</v>

3149
01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:52.670

<v Speaker 1>This goes into chem trails and operation funder foot 85 people.</v>

3151
01:24:58.971 --> 01:25:00.020
<v Speaker 1>Once he takes that,</v>

3152
01:25:00.180 --> 01:25:02.170
<v Speaker 1>and we started talking about Kennedy and who did it,</v>

3153
01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:03.513

01:25:03.690 --> 01:25:04.523
<v Speaker 1>did it.</v>

3155
01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:06.433
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

3158
01:25:13.311 --> 01:25:14.840
<v Speaker 1>candidate for fighting mighty mouse.</v>

3159
01:25:15.890 --> 01:25:17.750
<v Speaker 1>And for me it was a tough motherfucker man.</v>

3160
01:25:18.110 --> 01:25:21.530
<v Speaker 1>People just write him off cause he also got destroyed by Dj.</v>

3161
01:25:21.531 --> 01:25:24.150
<v Speaker 1>But number three in the world really doesn't lose just djs.</v>

3162
01:25:24.151 --> 01:25:26.070
<v Speaker 1>Just something special was just CJ.</v>

01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:16.430
<v Speaker 2>before Cody fought Cruz,</v>

3195
01:26:16.730 --> 01:26:18.080
<v Speaker 2>but after co co he fought Cruz.</v>

01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:25.160
<v Speaker 2>Like a tank is fast as fuck.</v>

3202
01:26:25.161 --> 01:26:30.161
<v Speaker 2>His boxing is laser beam accurate and he's getting better and it wasn't better</v>

01:26:31.941 --> 01:26:34.680
<v Speaker 2>He outclass dom and then you see you can't do that.</v>

01:28:47.851 --> 01:28:48.561
<v Speaker 2>It has to be there.</v>

3292
01:28:48.561 --> 01:28:49.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3293
01:28:49.190 --> 01:28:51.950
<v Speaker 2>like people have got to be able to talk to you take him there and we just</v>

3294
01:28:51.951 --> 01:28:52.950
<v Speaker 2>haven't seen it yet.</v>

3295
01:28:53.570 --> 01:28:53.701
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3296
01:28:53.701 --> 01:28:55.010
<v Speaker 2>Dj has got a fun personality.</v>

3297
01:28:55.011 --> 01:28:56.180
<v Speaker 2>He's great on podcasts.</v>

3298
01:28:56.210 --> 01:28:57.050
<v Speaker 2>He's a fun dude.</v>

3299
01:28:57.410 --> 01:29:00.110
<v Speaker 2>It's just people for whatever reason,</v>

3300
01:29:00.170 --> 01:29:01.003
<v Speaker 2>haven't you?</v>

3301
01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:02.880
<v Speaker 2>I appreciated what they're seeing.</v>

3302
01:29:03.290 --> 01:29:06.060
<v Speaker 2>Chocolate seat in in the inbox and they think he's,</v>

3303
01:29:06.150 --> 01:29:07.580
<v Speaker 2>if you talked to any boxing,</v>

3304
01:29:07.650 --> 01:29:08.760
<v Speaker 2>he's the best in the world.</v>

3305
01:29:08.761 --> 01:29:10.110
<v Speaker 2>He fights on triple g's card.</v>

3306
01:29:10.230 --> 01:29:12.060
<v Speaker 2>The paper you I think is next weekend.</v>

3307
01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:16.770
<v Speaker 2>Does anyone now for Miga?</v>

3308
01:29:17.250 --> 01:29:19.200
<v Speaker 2>I think Tj is the most exciting.</v>

3309
01:29:19.201 --> 01:29:20.034
<v Speaker 2>What a scrabble.</v>

3310
01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:20.911
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

3311
01:29:20.911 --> 01:29:22.500
<v Speaker 2>Ray Borg all over it.</v>

3312
01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:23.610
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

3313
01:29:23.610 --> 01:29:27.270
<v Speaker 2>Who's grabbing 20 fibers are mad dogs,</v>

3314
01:29:27.271 --> 01:29:27.690
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3315
01:29:27.690 --> 01:29:29.220
<v Speaker 2>the pace is so insane.</v>

3316
01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:32.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't you think that Tj is the most exciting fight?</v>

3317
01:29:32.930 --> 01:29:33.420
<v Speaker 2>Tj,</v>

3318
01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:34.800
<v Speaker 2>Tj Dillashaw no,</v>

3319
01:29:34.801 --> 01:29:35.250
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3320
01:29:35.250 --> 01:29:35.730
<v Speaker 2>definitely no.</v>

3321
01:29:35.730 --> 01:29:38.340
<v Speaker 2>He's decided to watch,</v>

3322
01:29:38.341 --> 01:29:38.910
<v Speaker 2>but he's mostly,</v>

3323
01:29:38.910 --> 01:29:40.070
<v Speaker 2>he's sliding past.</v>

3324
01:29:40.350 --> 01:29:42.480
<v Speaker 2>He's definitely one of Orthodox.</v>

3325
01:29:42.481 --> 01:29:43.021
<v Speaker 2>He's just so,</v>

3326
01:29:43.021 --> 01:29:44.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean I see Cody Garbrandt,</v>

3327
01:29:44.890 --> 01:29:45.723
<v Speaker 2>Dominick Cruz,</v>

3328
01:29:45.940 --> 01:29:47.220
<v Speaker 2>she rumble Johnson.</v>

3329
01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:47.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3330
01:29:47.521 --> 01:29:48.520
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying exciting like,</v>

3331
01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:49.383
<v Speaker 2>cause it just,</v>

3332
01:29:49.410 --> 01:29:52.710
<v Speaker 2>he's from angles and just movements and I dunno man.</v>

3333
01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:53.340
<v Speaker 2>He's just,</v>

3334
01:29:53.340 --> 01:29:53.431
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3335
01:29:53.431 --> 01:29:54.340
<v Speaker 2>he's access pace.</v>

3336
01:29:54.410 --> 01:29:54.780
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

3337
01:29:54.780 --> 01:29:55.613
<v Speaker 2>As far as the most,</v>

3338
01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:56.970
<v Speaker 2>one of the best in the world,</v>

3339
01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.050
<v Speaker 2>there's no doubt about it.</v>

3340
01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:00.030
<v Speaker 2>And if he can beat Cody.</v>

3341
01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:05.300
<v Speaker 2>He's in my pound for pound top five hours and I think he was when he beat Barao</v>

3342
01:30:05.971 --> 01:30:07.020
<v Speaker 2>the second time I was like,</v>

3343
01:30:07.021 --> 01:30:07.141
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3344
01:30:07.141 --> 01:30:09.450
<v Speaker 2>make an argument for someone who's higher up the top</v>

3345
01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:13.470
<v Speaker 2>high level off the cage.</v>

3346
01:30:13.471 --> 01:30:14.250
<v Speaker 2>That back tag,</v>

3347
01:30:14.250 --> 01:30:18.390
<v Speaker 2>it took that back and immediately went to the body triangle was squeeze.</v>

3348
01:30:18.391 --> 01:30:19.410
<v Speaker 2>Everybody does that now.</v>

3349
01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:20.790
<v Speaker 2>Everybody goes to the squeeze,</v>

3350
01:30:21.420 --> 01:30:22.380
<v Speaker 2>especially with their camp.</v>

3351
01:30:22.381 --> 01:30:22.801
<v Speaker 2>Think about it.</v>

3352
01:30:22.801 --> 01:30:25.350
<v Speaker 2>He's with Aldo and Barao.</v>

3353
01:30:25.410 --> 01:30:26.243
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3354
01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:28.260
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy that that was a rare move.</v>

3355
01:30:28.330 --> 01:30:33.300
<v Speaker 2>The body triangle was a rare move taking the Dobie in the late nineties that's</v>

3356
01:30:33.301 --> 01:30:34.134
<v Speaker 2>true body.</v>

3357
01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:40.050
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty rare up until Ivan salivary did it and I didn't start doing it and</v>

3358
01:30:40.051 --> 01:30:43.770
<v Speaker 2>putting it into my game heavily until John John came back from Abu Dhabi and I</v>

3359
01:30:43.771 --> 01:30:44.071
<v Speaker 2>felt like,</v>

3360
01:30:44.071 --> 01:30:45.780
<v Speaker 2>why did you keep doing a triangle cross?</v>

3361
01:30:46.420 --> 01:30:50.310
<v Speaker 2>I can kept holding him like that because he never really did that in class.</v>

3362
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:51.990
<v Speaker 2>He's just straight hooks and they said,</v>

3363
01:30:51.991 --> 01:30:52.351
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3364
01:30:52.351 --> 01:30:54.330
<v Speaker 2>so greased so much grace,</v>

3365
01:30:54.331 --> 01:30:58.560
<v Speaker 2>they're slipping so I got to lock their hips slipped down and that's all I need.</v>

3366
01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:00.120
<v Speaker 2>When John Jack says something,</v>

3367
01:31:01.180 --> 01:31:04.440
<v Speaker 2>you just to pretty much bank on it and that's the way to go.</v>

3368
01:31:05.130 --> 01:31:07.740
<v Speaker 2>He's ever told me to do and he kind of direction.</v>

3369
01:31:07.741 --> 01:31:08.574
<v Speaker 2>He's pointed me in.</v>

3370
01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:08.971
<v Speaker 2>Boom,</v>

3371
01:31:08.971 --> 01:31:13.320
<v Speaker 2>I go right to know who I bet has the most body lock time in the UFC and you can,</v>

3372
01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:14.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who would track it.</v>

3373
01:31:14.910 --> 01:31:16.650
<v Speaker 2>I would bet Anderson Silva does.</v>

3374
01:31:16.670 --> 01:31:18.060
<v Speaker 2>When you think about with Travis Luder,</v>

3375
01:31:18.270 --> 01:31:19.140
<v Speaker 2>Dan Henderson,</v>

3376
01:31:19.170 --> 01:31:22.020
<v Speaker 2>that mother fucker spends a ton of time there.</v>

3377
01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:25.050
<v Speaker 2>A ton of you think about his flights when they go to the ground.</v>

3378
01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:26.910
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard to get out of man.</v>

3379
01:31:26.911 --> 01:31:28.410
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen anybody get out of it.</v>

3380
01:31:29.970 --> 01:31:31.440
<v Speaker 2>Did he get Travis looters back?</v>

3381
01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:32.333
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3382
01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:35.490
<v Speaker 2>Triangle triangle that remembered it from the bottom.</v>

3383
01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:36.913
<v Speaker 2>You're working here.</v>

3384
01:31:38.130 --> 01:31:39.060
<v Speaker 2>Travis mounted him.</v>

3385
01:31:39.061 --> 01:31:39.894
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

3386
01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:40.910
<v Speaker 2>but it's exhausting.</v>

3387
01:31:41.170 --> 01:31:42.270
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to breathe and stuff.</v>

3388
01:31:42.610 --> 01:31:43.020
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

3389
01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:46.650
<v Speaker 2>that was my best example for the longest time of a guy that was on death's door</v>

3390
01:31:46.651 --> 01:31:49.620
<v Speaker 2>was Travis when he didn't make weight for the Anderson Silva fight a title fight</v>

3391
01:31:54.310 --> 01:31:55.950
<v Speaker 2>the triangle.</v>

3392
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:58.183
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

3393
01:31:58.230 --> 01:32:02.530
<v Speaker 2>And also being a really tiny guy and sweaty as fuck and the third round with two</v>

3394
01:32:02.531 --> 01:32:03.364
<v Speaker 2>minutes left.</v>

3395
01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:07.390
<v Speaker 2>These guys move so fast and they don't get fucking tired.</v>

3396
01:32:07.470 --> 01:32:08.190
<v Speaker 2>That's just crazy.</v>

3397
01:32:08.190 --> 01:32:08.800
<v Speaker 2>All Day.</v>

3398
01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:10.750
<v Speaker 2>The game is so different for them.</v>

3399
01:32:11.980 --> 01:32:12.970
<v Speaker 2>Must they get tired too,</v>

3400
01:32:12.971 --> 01:32:13.580
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3401
01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:17.120
<v Speaker 2>like I remember when Alibaba routine off od a Dj and Dj outworked him.</v>

3402
01:32:17.150 --> 01:32:18.180
<v Speaker 2>Then it turns out that he was all,</v>

3403
01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:20.950
<v Speaker 2>if you're one 25 around Epl,</v>

3404
01:32:20.951 --> 01:32:21.611
<v Speaker 2>probably not for you.</v>

3405
01:32:21.611 --> 01:32:22.890
<v Speaker 2>That's probably of the game for a board.</v>

3406
01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:24.580
<v Speaker 2>Gets landed some big shots right here.</v>

3407
01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:24.981
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

3408
01:32:24.981 --> 01:32:25.781
<v Speaker 2>Borg is no joke,</v>

3409
01:32:25.781 --> 01:32:26.290
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3410
01:32:26.290 --> 01:32:27.123
<v Speaker 2>but neither is for me.</v>

3411
01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:28.600
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3412
01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:29.610
<v Speaker 2>For me to get to know.</v>

3413
01:32:30.230 --> 01:32:31.750
<v Speaker 2>These are hard.</v>

3414
01:32:31.810 --> 01:32:32.260
<v Speaker 2>He brought,</v>

3415
01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:33.780
<v Speaker 2>he busted his face also Sanderson,</v>

3416
01:32:33.790 --> 01:32:38.350
<v Speaker 2>Travis looter triangle and them shit and he's gay.</v>

3417
01:32:38.351 --> 01:32:39.430
<v Speaker 2>He's holding the back of his neck.</v>

3418
01:32:39.580 --> 01:32:41.050
<v Speaker 2>He's letting them have that arm bar.</v>

3419
01:32:41.051 --> 01:32:41.381
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

3420
01:32:41.381 --> 01:32:42.730
<v Speaker 2>He's letting them have that left arm.</v>

3421
01:32:42.940 --> 01:32:43.840
<v Speaker 2>He should swing.</v>

3422
01:32:44.110 --> 01:32:45.090
<v Speaker 2>He's holding onto his neck.</v>

3423
01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:48.790
<v Speaker 2>That's how Randy couture got armbar against the ensign just holding all that</v>

3424
01:32:48.791 --> 01:32:49.870
<v Speaker 2>neck and he's not doing it anymore.</v>

3425
01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:51.790
<v Speaker 2>It's fine right there too.</v>

3426
01:32:51.820 --> 01:32:52.361
<v Speaker 2>He has it.</v>

3427
01:32:52.361 --> 01:32:52.781
<v Speaker 2>It's open.</v>

3428
01:32:52.781 --> 01:32:53.614
<v Speaker 2>He should be swinging.</v>

3429
01:32:55.770 --> 01:32:56.610
<v Speaker 2>Just came off him.</v>

3430
01:32:57.090 --> 01:32:57.923
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

3431
01:32:58.660 --> 01:33:00.700
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

3432
01:33:02.730 --> 01:33:03.431
<v Speaker 2>He went for it.</v>

3433
01:33:03.431 --> 01:33:04.930
<v Speaker 2>At least he's out of that spot.</v>

3434
01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:05.853
<v Speaker 2>Got To give this to book.</v>

3435
01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:06.930
<v Speaker 2>This is torque.</v>

3436
01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:08.800
<v Speaker 2>Immediately goes back to the Black Mountain.</v>

3437
01:33:08.850 --> 01:33:09.540
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3438
01:33:09.540 --> 01:33:10.373
<v Speaker 2>Glory.</v>

3439
01:33:12.370 --> 01:33:16.810
<v Speaker 2>His transitions and those fucking elbows from the top position are so scary.</v>

3440
01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:17.570
<v Speaker 2>Dude from Megan.</v>

3441
01:33:17.570 --> 01:33:20.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying right arm triangle right there.</v>

3442
01:33:20.051 --> 01:33:21.160
<v Speaker 2>He should just close it off.</v>

3443
01:33:21.790 --> 01:33:22.930
<v Speaker 2>Was arms on under yet?</v>

3444
01:33:23.110 --> 01:33:24.400
<v Speaker 2>He could have just put it there,</v>

3445
01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:25.293
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3446
01:33:25.450 --> 01:33:27.860
<v Speaker 2>But the other guys got risk control so you can slide them out.</v>

3447
01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:30.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh scramble.</v>

3448
01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:34.130
<v Speaker 2>He still has it right there and he still has that opportunity for them to turn</v>

3449
01:33:34.150 --> 01:33:37.660
<v Speaker 2>the twister pass free the knee and then slice to three quarter mount just like</v>

3450
01:33:37.670 --> 01:33:38.503
<v Speaker 2>Dan.</v>

3451
01:33:38.860 --> 01:33:42.340
<v Speaker 2>But this speed of these exchanges is what you're really supposed to be looking</v>

3452
01:33:42.341 --> 01:33:43.174
<v Speaker 2>for in him.</v>

3453
01:33:43.570 --> 01:33:43.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3454
01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:44.593
<v Speaker 2>he's going for it.</v>

3455
01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:45.490
<v Speaker 2>He's going through the choke.</v>

3456
01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:46.211
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>

3457
01:33:46.211 --> 01:33:48.700
<v Speaker 2>Five seconds lab and it's got to go for it.</v>

3458
01:33:48.701 --> 01:33:49.750
<v Speaker 2>A tough guy to chunk.</v>

3459
01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:51.190
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3460
01:33:51.190 --> 01:33:53.650
<v Speaker 2>These guys at this weight class are so fucking amazing.</v>

3461
01:33:54.430 --> 01:33:56.260
<v Speaker 2>Like this is what MMA supposed to be.</v>

3462
01:33:56.470 --> 01:34:00.220
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to be like movements without any physical limitations.</v>

3463
01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:00.580
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3464
01:34:00.580 --> 01:34:04.450
<v Speaker 2>like you just can't move at this pace if you weigh 300 pounds.</v>

3465
01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:04.960
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

3466
01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:06.130
<v Speaker 2>but also at that,</v>

3467
01:34:06.150 --> 01:34:06.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3468
01:34:06.391 --> 01:34:06.911
<v Speaker 2>at heavyweight,</v>

3469
01:34:06.911 --> 01:34:08.020
<v Speaker 2>the lighter weights,</v>

3470
01:34:08.021 --> 01:34:08.950
<v Speaker 2>the reason why we like it,</v>

3471
01:34:08.951 --> 01:34:10.690
<v Speaker 2>because it can end at any given moment.</v>

3472
01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:13.210
<v Speaker 2>These chansom getting finished aren't great.</v>

3473
01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:13.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3474
01:34:13.511 --> 01:34:13.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3475
01:34:13.870 --> 01:34:17.590
<v Speaker 2>except for Cody who knocks guys out with one shot.</v>

3476
01:34:17.591 --> 01:34:18.680
<v Speaker 2>I want the linen person.</v>

3477
01:34:18.710 --> 01:34:18.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3478
01:34:18.970 --> 01:34:21.800
<v Speaker 2>One 35 well then I also was wanting,</v>

3479
01:34:21.801 --> 01:34:22.001
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3480
01:34:22.001 --> 01:34:26.110
<v Speaker 2>djs knocked out a few people at 25 and he knocked out Benevidez one pond.</v>

3481
01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:31.800
<v Speaker 2>But the reality is it's way more rare that weight class to see like a one shot</v>

3482
01:34:32.291 --> 01:34:35.660
<v Speaker 2>Kao and that's why it's not as big as would a draw.</v>

3483
01:34:35.780 --> 01:34:36.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3484
01:34:36.430 --> 01:34:39.070
<v Speaker 2>But it's also why those guys exchanged many more techniques.</v>

3485
01:34:39.071 --> 01:34:41.680
<v Speaker 2>They're not gonna be able to finish the other off with one shot.</v>

3486
01:34:41.681 --> 01:34:43.780
<v Speaker 2>So everybody's much more technical oriented,</v>

3487
01:34:43.970 --> 01:34:44.660
<v Speaker 2>more Korean.</v>

3488
01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:44.891
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

3489
01:34:44.891 --> 01:34:45.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3490
01:34:45.220 --> 01:34:45.911
<v Speaker 2>You have to be like,</v>

3491
01:34:45.911 --> 01:34:48.070
<v Speaker 2>if you look at these two guys and these scrambles,</v>

3492
01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:49.210
<v Speaker 2>they're so technical.</v>

3493
01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:51.280
<v Speaker 2>If you had the skills that heavyweight or two or five,</v>

3494
01:34:51.281 --> 01:34:52.300
<v Speaker 2>it's either of these guys,</v>

3495
01:34:52.900 --> 01:34:54.200
<v Speaker 2>you'd be the greatest fall.</v>

3496
01:34:54.201 --> 01:34:54.810
<v Speaker 2>My Gosh.</v>

3497
01:34:54.810 --> 01:34:57.440
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if there was a fucking heavyweight that move like Ray Borg.</v>

3498
01:34:57.460 --> 01:34:58.550
<v Speaker 2>That would be insane.</v>

3499
01:34:58.670 --> 01:34:59.191
<v Speaker 2>Be Scared,</v>

3500
01:34:59.191 --> 01:34:59.540
<v Speaker 2>Bishop.</v>

3501
01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:00.650
<v Speaker 2>Greatest of all time.</v>

3502
01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:01.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3503
01:35:01.190 --> 01:35:03.470
<v Speaker 2>like Ray Borg is a top 10 contender for sure,</v>

3504
01:35:03.530 --> 01:35:05.060
<v Speaker 2>but he hasn't got a shot at the title yet.</v>

3505
01:35:05.390 --> 01:35:06.320
<v Speaker 2>He was a heavyweight.</v>

3506
01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:06.971
<v Speaker 2>If you've got to,</v>

3507
01:35:06.971 --> 01:35:08.750
<v Speaker 2>if he was a heavyweight to be the greatest of all time.</v>

3508
01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:09.870
<v Speaker 2>If you want to,</v>

3509
01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:10.581
<v Speaker 2>if there's anybody who,</v>

3510
01:35:10.581 --> 01:35:11.420
<v Speaker 2>who's like,</v>

3511
01:35:11.421 --> 01:35:15.470
<v Speaker 2>if there are any athletes in the other sports who have that kind of explosion</v>

3512
01:35:15.471 --> 01:35:16.304
<v Speaker 2>speed.</v>

3513
01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:17.293
<v Speaker 2>Dexterity.</v>

3514
01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:19.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3515
01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:19.350
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

3516
01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:20.183
<v Speaker 2>like take,</v>

3517
01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:21.100
<v Speaker 2>take a Westbrook,</v>

3518
01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:22.220
<v Speaker 2>Russell Westbrook,</v>

3519
01:35:22.250 --> 01:35:23.540
<v Speaker 2>if he'd strange MMA,</v>

3520
01:35:23.570 --> 01:35:24.410
<v Speaker 2>Russell Westbrook,</v>

3521
01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:25.370
<v Speaker 2>if he had trained MMA,</v>

3522
01:35:25.371 --> 01:35:25.821
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>

3523
01:35:25.821 --> 01:35:30.320
<v Speaker 2>since he was 17 it's a chance he could be a guy that big with that kind of</v>

3524
01:35:30.321 --> 01:35:31.154
<v Speaker 2>speed.</v>

3525
01:35:31.250 --> 01:35:31.970
<v Speaker 2>They're out there,</v>

3526
01:35:31.970 --> 01:35:32.870
<v Speaker 2>they're just not interesting.</v>

3527
01:35:32.871 --> 01:35:36.430
<v Speaker 2>You Punch in the face where they can make way more money playing football and</v>

3528
01:35:36.510 --> 01:35:40.250
<v Speaker 2>shooting them and also they probably started doing that sport when they were a</v>

3529
01:35:40.251 --> 01:35:40.850
<v Speaker 2>little kid.</v>

3530
01:35:40.850 --> 01:35:41.960
<v Speaker 2>You've got amazing at it.</v>

3531
01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:44.930
<v Speaker 2>Transfer over an MMA in 20 years.</v>

3532
01:35:44.931 --> 01:35:45.650
<v Speaker 2>We'll see it will,</v>

3533
01:35:45.650 --> 01:35:46.910
<v Speaker 2>you'll see a guy like that.</v>

3534
01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:47.301
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

3535
01:35:47.301 --> 01:35:47.900
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

3536
01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:49.070
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not the heavier weights.</v>

3537
01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:50.660
<v Speaker 2>They're going to have to want to do it.</v>

3538
01:35:50.661 --> 01:35:51.370
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

3539
01:35:51.370 --> 01:35:53.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's going to have to bring the parents to do it.</v>

3540
01:35:53.870 --> 01:35:57.480
<v Speaker 2>To encourage the Johnson could play NFL fee.</v>

3541
01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.420
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3542
01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:00.141
<v Speaker 2>not right now,</v>

3543
01:36:00.141 --> 01:36:00.890
<v Speaker 2>but if he,</v>

3544
01:36:00.890 --> 01:36:05.020
<v Speaker 2>if he played football in high school and in College Board has got the frame and</v>

3545
01:36:05.021 --> 01:36:05.530
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3546
01:36:05.530 --> 01:36:09.040
<v Speaker 2>and the height he'd be safe to,</v>

3547
01:36:09.050 --> 01:36:09.883
<v Speaker 2>he'd be a safety.</v>

3548
01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:11.240
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of speculation.</v>

3549
01:36:11.241 --> 01:36:13.330
<v Speaker 2>That's like saying Ray Lewis was a kickboxer.</v>

3550
01:36:13.370 --> 01:36:14.150
<v Speaker 2>He'd be a world champ,</v>

3551
01:36:14.150 --> 01:36:16.100
<v Speaker 2>but what I'm saying is you guys are talking about these athletes.</v>

3552
01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:18.650
<v Speaker 2>We already got a feel of it.</v>

3553
01:36:18.651 --> 01:36:18.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3554
01:36:18.860 --> 01:36:19.693
<v Speaker 2>John Jones.</v>

3555
01:36:19.990 --> 01:36:20.201
<v Speaker 2>John,</v>

3556
01:36:20.201 --> 01:36:20.411
<v Speaker 2>John,</v>

3557
01:36:20.411 --> 01:36:20.621
<v Speaker 2>John,</v>

3558
01:36:20.621 --> 01:36:20.970
<v Speaker 2>John.</v>

3559
01:36:20.970 --> 01:36:21.200
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3560
01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:21.970
<v Speaker 2>John Jones can,</v>

3561
01:36:21.970 --> 01:36:22.140
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3562
01:36:22.140 --> 01:36:22.231
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3563
01:36:22.231 --> 01:36:22.371
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3564
01:36:22.371 --> 01:36:24.140
<v Speaker 2>John Jones wouldn't be professor nail their sport.</v>

3565
01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:25.573
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that funny?</v>

3566
01:36:26.110 --> 01:36:26.943
<v Speaker 2>Ask him about it.</v>

3567
01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:30.020
<v Speaker 2>He ran the 40 he ran like a four nine or five flat.</v>

3568
01:36:30.330 --> 01:36:30.491
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

3569
01:36:30.491 --> 01:36:31.670
<v Speaker 2>his brothers is not going to hand.</v>

3570
01:36:31.671 --> 01:36:32.780
<v Speaker 2>His brothers are beast.</v>

3571
01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:34.400
<v Speaker 2>She comes my same skills.</v>

3572
01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:34.921
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

3573
01:36:34.921 --> 01:36:35.360
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

3574
01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:36.290
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to compare it.</v>

3575
01:36:36.291 --> 01:36:37.250
<v Speaker 2>Apples and oranges,</v>

3576
01:36:38.380 --> 01:36:39.410
<v Speaker 2>but it's same.</v>

3577
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:40.490
<v Speaker 2>It's the same.</v>

3578
01:36:40.910 --> 01:36:41.960
<v Speaker 2>You know he's so athletic,</v>

3579
01:36:41.961 --> 01:36:42.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3580
01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:42.861
<v Speaker 2>John?</v>

3581
01:36:42.861 --> 01:36:43.041
<v Speaker 2>John,</v>

3582
01:36:43.041 --> 01:36:43.850
<v Speaker 2>we're fighting.</v>

3583
01:36:43.850 --> 01:36:44.210
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3584
01:36:44.210 --> 01:36:45.500
<v Speaker 2>but that trend then fell.</v>

3585
01:36:45.550 --> 01:36:46.260
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3586
01:36:46.260 --> 01:36:47.120
<v Speaker 2>Well you know what man,</v>

3587
01:36:47.380 --> 01:36:47.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3588
01:36:47.610 --> 01:36:49.480
<v Speaker 2>How much time do you dedicate towards that?</v>

3589
01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:52.630
<v Speaker 2>How much time does it dead court dedicate towards wrestling and MMA primer on a</v>

3590
01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:54.680
<v Speaker 2>40 or let's just say a sprint.</v>

3591
01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:56.180
<v Speaker 2>If you went against the guy who was,</v>

3592
01:36:56.181 --> 01:36:57.590
<v Speaker 2>he weighed 220 pounds.</v>

3593
01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:02.550
<v Speaker 2>If you just ran a sprint against division one football guys smoking the shit out</v>

3594
01:37:02.551 --> 01:37:02.671
<v Speaker 2>of him.</v>

3595
01:37:02.671 --> 01:37:03.420
<v Speaker 2>That's just,</v>

3596
01:37:03.420 --> 01:37:04.610
<v Speaker 2>that's pure athleticism.</v>

3597
01:37:04.670 --> 01:37:05.660
<v Speaker 2>But if you played football,</v>

3598
01:37:05.661 --> 01:37:10.520
<v Speaker 2>maybe puts on a lot of muscle and a lot of ways lower defensive and you don't</v>

3599
01:37:10.521 --> 01:37:12.350
<v Speaker 2>have to be that fast play in these days.</v>

3600
01:37:12.351 --> 01:37:13.240
<v Speaker 2>You do at the end.</v>

3601
01:37:13.370 --> 01:37:14.090
<v Speaker 2>How far can they,</v>

3602
01:37:14.090 --> 01:37:16.520
<v Speaker 2>how do they run for seven forties yeah,</v>

3603
01:37:17.010 --> 01:37:22.010
<v Speaker 2>Shit's of Linemen Watch 300 290 pounds when the four six the at the end,</v>

3604
01:37:22.431 --> 01:37:23.990
<v Speaker 2>those guys are freaks.</v>

3605
01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:26.570
<v Speaker 2>They just had a 370 pound guy,</v>

3606
01:37:26.590 --> 01:37:29.390
<v Speaker 2>Ron a four seven 43 70 do you see this?</v>

3607
01:37:29.490 --> 01:37:34.490
<v Speaker 2>This is [inaudible] 74 standing next to that guy,</v>

3608
01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:37.160
<v Speaker 2>Jamie looked that guy,</v>

3609
01:37:37.161 --> 01:37:40.730
<v Speaker 2>if he's have linemen three 70 he ran a four salmon McCardle did.</v>

3610
01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:41.733
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

3611
01:37:41.740 --> 01:37:43.970
<v Speaker 2>Think about what that would feel like dealing with,</v>

3612
01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:47.450
<v Speaker 2>think about what that would feel like to be on the field or that guy runs by</v>

3613
01:37:47.451 --> 01:37:47.690
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

3614
01:37:47.690 --> 01:37:48.620
<v Speaker 2>That's what he was MVP.</v>

3615
01:37:48.910 --> 01:37:49.743
<v Speaker 2>Look at these elbows.</v>

3616
01:37:50.510 --> 01:37:54.230
<v Speaker 2>But I mean if you could stand there like right next to him as he's sprinting,</v>

3617
01:37:54.380 --> 01:37:56.370
<v Speaker 2>just let them run by Sega is feel</v>

3618
01:37:56.370 --> 01:38:00.780
<v Speaker 1>the force whole different thing of almost 400 pounds running faster than you</v>

3619
01:38:00.781 --> 01:38:01.614
<v Speaker 1>ever could hope to.</v>

3620
01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3621
01:38:02.850 --> 01:38:03.683
<v Speaker 1>Scary.</v>

3622
01:38:04.590 --> 01:38:08.220
<v Speaker 1>Launching his entire body down the track.</v>

3623
01:38:09.570 --> 01:38:12.510
<v Speaker 1>They find that guys who are that big and that fast actually ended up getting</v>

3624
01:38:12.511 --> 01:38:13.620
<v Speaker 1>injured faster.</v>

3625
01:38:13.621 --> 01:38:17.820
<v Speaker 1>So bigger and faster in the NFL according to fight or sports science.</v>

3626
01:38:18.630 --> 01:38:19.390
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3627
01:38:19.390 --> 01:38:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

3628
01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:22.050
<v Speaker 1>Not always better because you get injured faster.</v>

3629
01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:26.020
<v Speaker 1>Well I would imagine there's soft tissue could only take so much debate.</v>

3630
01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:28.080
<v Speaker 1>They're talking about like the biggest guys.</v>

3631
01:38:28.590 --> 01:38:28.981
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3632
01:38:28.981 --> 01:38:32.640
<v Speaker 1>apparently they did a thing where like you get huge dudes who are really fast</v>

3633
01:38:32.641 --> 01:38:35.940
<v Speaker 1>and somehow they don't last as long as somebody who is,</v>

3634
01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:37.020
<v Speaker 1>because it's physics.</v>

3635
01:38:37.021 --> 01:38:37.231
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3636
01:38:37.231 --> 01:38:39.790
<v Speaker 1>So because your body can only take so much.</v>

3637
01:38:40.670 --> 01:38:41.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3638
01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:43.990
<v Speaker 1>It depends on the position and depending on the guy for sure.</v>

3639
01:38:43.991 --> 01:38:44.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3640
01:38:44.130 --> 01:38:48.450
<v Speaker 1>Well it's also the sport itself is so fucking ruthless on your body.</v>

3641
01:38:48.810 --> 01:38:51.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean it just breaks you the injury,</v>

3642
01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:53.610
<v Speaker 1>the injury rate is 100% or something.</v>

3643
01:38:53.611 --> 01:38:55.060
<v Speaker 1>Somebody that somebody said that like in the NFL,</v>

3644
01:38:55.061 --> 01:38:57.450
<v Speaker 1>like everybody's injured injury.</v>

3645
01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:00.360
<v Speaker 1>I had an area and foster on the podcast this week and one of the things he said</v>

3646
01:39:00.361 --> 01:39:00.691
<v Speaker 1>is like,</v>

3647
01:39:00.691 --> 01:39:01.980
<v Speaker 1>if my kids wanted to play football,</v>

3648
01:39:01.981 --> 01:39:02.281
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

3649
01:39:02.281 --> 01:39:03.031
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>

3650
01:39:03.031 --> 01:39:03.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3651
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:04.103
<v Speaker 1>playing football.</v>

3652
01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:04.471
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

3653
01:39:04.471 --> 01:39:08.250
<v Speaker 1>I didn't bust my ass to get to this position to watch you do that shit.</v>

3654
01:39:08.870 --> 01:39:09.130

<v Speaker 1>you can see how it says that that guy was a freak done.</v>

3657
01:39:13.890 --> 01:39:14.723
<v Speaker 1>He's a freak.</v>

01:39:18.031 --> 01:39:18.481
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

3662
01:39:18.481 --> 01:39:19.231
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired of it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3667
01:39:22.860 --> 01:39:25.110
<v Speaker 1>he was tired because he wanted to,</v>

3668
01:39:25.111 --> 01:39:25.261
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3669
01:39:25.261 --> 01:39:26.640
<v Speaker 1>he had a bunch of injuries and he was like,</v>

3670
01:39:26.641 --> 01:39:27.300
<v Speaker 1>this is not,</v>

3671
01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:27.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do this.</v>

3672
01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:28.501
<v Speaker 1>He's only 30,</v>

3673
01:39:28.501 --> 01:39:28.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3674
01:39:28.770 --> 01:39:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3675
01:39:29.090 --> 01:39:31.290
<v Speaker 1>He's young primary command.</v>

01:39:31.380 --> 01:39:32.820
<v Speaker 1>So this fucking prime right now.</v>

3677
01:39:33.150 --> 01:39:34.590
<v Speaker 1>30 and he decided I'm done.</v>

3678
01:39:34.710 --> 01:39:36.990
<v Speaker 1>Smart for running back you that it's time to go.</v>

3679
01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:38.610
<v Speaker 1>He's a smart dude.</v>

3680
01:39:38.910 --> 01:39:39.870
<v Speaker 1>He's not like,</v>

3681
01:39:39.871 --> 01:39:41.460
<v Speaker 1>he's not completely motivated by money.</v>

3682
01:39:41.461 --> 01:39:41.731
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

3683
01:39:41.731 --> 01:39:43.260
<v Speaker 1>he's not motivated by fame.</v>

3684
01:39:43.290 --> 01:39:44.160
<v Speaker 1>He also got paid.</v>

3685
01:39:44.310 --> 01:39:46.620
<v Speaker 1>So it's easy to say that one aid plenty in the bank.</v>

3686
01:39:46.730 --> 01:39:47.341
<v Speaker 1>He's hanging back.</v>

3687
01:39:47.341 --> 01:39:49.470
<v Speaker 1>But he's also being smart about being paid,</v>

3688
01:39:49.770 --> 01:39:50.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3689

<v Speaker 2>Toronto's was a couple of years ago now.</v>

3792
01:42:28.650 --> 01:42:30.740
<v Speaker 2>There was a guy who recently did some crazy shit.</v>

3793
01:42:31.100 --> 01:42:31.933
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

3794
01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:35.510
<v Speaker 2>I had six wide receivers speed at 300 pounds.</v>

3795
01:42:35.511 --> 01:42:35.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3796
01:42:35.710 --> 01:42:36.441
<v Speaker 2>Now think about this.</v>

3797
01:42:36.441 --> 01:42:37.130
<v Speaker 2>Look at him.</v>

3798
01:42:37.130 --> 01:42:38.190
<v Speaker 2>He should play defense.</v>

3799
01:42:38.210 --> 01:42:39.110
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that offense.</v>

3800
01:42:39.140 --> 01:42:39.690
<v Speaker 2>He could,</v>

3801
01:42:39.690 --> 01:42:42.940
<v Speaker 2>they could use his speed on defense playing an offensive lineman.</v>

3802
01:42:42.950 --> 01:42:44.060
<v Speaker 2>You don't need speed that</v>

3803
01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:47.520
<v Speaker 2>what'd you snuck?</v>

3808
01:42:52.761 --> 01:42:53.594
<v Speaker 2>With that speed.</v>

3809
01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:55.700
<v Speaker 2>Imagine him right there in the middle.</v>

3810

<v Speaker 2>Some guy ran the fastest.</v>

3811
01:42:58.161 --> 01:42:59.060
<v Speaker 2>Whenever I think right.</v>

3812
01:42:59.061 --> 01:42:59.894
<v Speaker 2>The shaft,</v>

3813
01:42:59.900 --> 01:43:01.150

<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3819
01:43:04.541 --> 01:43:05.780
<v Speaker 2>Adidas gave this challenge to go.</v>

3820
01:43:05.781 --> 01:43:06.710

3936
01:46:07.931 --> 01:46:08.220
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3937
01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:08.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3938

<v Speaker 3>like 45 minutes,</v>

3939
01:46:10.721 --> 01:46:11.351
<v Speaker 3>I think 40,</v>

3940
01:46:11.351 --> 01:46:11.711
<v Speaker 3>40,</v>

3941
01:46:11.711 --> 01:46:12.544
<v Speaker 3>44 minutes.</v>

3942
01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:13.340
<v Speaker 3>Do you think,</v>

3943
01:46:13.340 --> 01:46:14.620
<v Speaker 3>do you train less?</v>

3944
01:46:14.650 --> 01:46:14.921
<v Speaker 3>Do you,</v>

3945
01:46:14.921 --> 01:46:15.191
<v Speaker 3>are you,</v>

3946
01:46:15.191 --> 01:46:15.430
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3947
01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:18.490
<v Speaker 3>Eddie put your headphones on so you realize how loud opening that bag back and</v>

3948
01:46:18.491 --> 01:46:19.060
<v Speaker 3>forth is.</v>

3949
01:46:19.060 --> 01:46:23.530
<v Speaker 3>Are you somebody now who believes in training less than you did from talking to</v>

3950
01:46:23.531 --> 01:46:23.981
<v Speaker 3>those guys?</v>

3951
01:46:23.981 --> 01:46:26.140
<v Speaker 3>As in our most people ever trained,</v>

3952
01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:27.580
<v Speaker 3>this is what I think the,</v>

3953
01:46:27.730 --> 01:46:32.230
<v Speaker 3>what Pablo has going on is something that he calls greasing the groove.</v>

3954
01:46:32.231 --> 01:46:34.240
<v Speaker 3>And what he believes is you should never go to failure.</v>

3955
01:46:34.570 --> 01:46:34.811
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

3956
01:46:34.811 --> 01:46:36.400
<v Speaker 3>your body is not designed to go to failure.</v>

3957
01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:37.473
<v Speaker 3>If you're doing,</v>

3958
01:46:37.710 --> 01:46:38.200
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3959
01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:39.060
<v Speaker 3>like let's say if you're,</v>

3960
01:46:39.061 --> 01:46:42.160
<v Speaker 3>you're doing something that you could do 10 reps with it and then at 10,</v>

3961
01:46:42.190 --> 01:46:43.023
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

3962
01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:46.690
<v Speaker 3>you should do five mm and they should walk away for five to 10 minutes.</v>

3963
01:46:46.740 --> 01:46:47.740
<v Speaker 3>Really do another five.</v>

3964
01:46:47.741 --> 01:46:47.951
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3965
01:46:47.951 --> 01:46:50.850
<v Speaker 3>because if you're trying to get strong when you're trying to get strong,</v>

3966
01:46:50.851 --> 01:46:55.050
<v Speaker 3>the way you do it is continue to do those motions correctly with full strength.</v>

3967
01:46:55.051 --> 01:46:55.884
<v Speaker 3>And full,</v>

3968
01:46:55.930 --> 01:46:56.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3969
01:46:56.490 --> 01:46:59.040
<v Speaker 3>full balance and full control of the kettle bell,</v>

3970
01:46:59.041 --> 01:47:00.210
<v Speaker 3>full control of the dumb bell,</v>

3971
01:47:00.211 --> 01:47:00.541
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

3972
01:47:00.541 --> 01:47:00.870
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

3973
01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:01.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3974
01:47:01.260 --> 01:47:04.780
<v Speaker 3>if you're doing clean and press where they doing dead lifts with full control so</v>

3975
01:47:04.781 --> 01:47:05.041
<v Speaker 3>that you're,</v>

3976
01:47:05.041 --> 01:47:07.440
<v Speaker 3>you're lifting with perfect technique,</v>

3977
01:47:07.470 --> 01:47:08.040
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3978
01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:11.820
<v Speaker 3>And then take a long time off so that when you come back 10 minutes later your</v>

3979
01:47:11.821 --> 01:47:13.710
<v Speaker 3>body is on 100% recovered.</v>

3980
01:47:13.950 --> 01:47:17.880
<v Speaker 3>So you're not like still dying from the last set that you did 30 seconds ago.</v>

3981
01:47:17.881 --> 01:47:18.181
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>

3982
01:47:18.181 --> 01:47:18.720
<v Speaker 3>push it,</v>

3983
01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:19.141
<v Speaker 3>push it.</v>

3984
01:47:19.141 --> 01:47:19.974
<v Speaker 3>Push it</v>

3985
01:47:21.330 --> 01:47:21.541
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

3986
01:47:21.541 --> 01:47:22.000
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3987
01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:23.460
<v Speaker 3>That's just what we're talking about.</v>

3988
01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:24.180
<v Speaker 3>Strengths.</v>

3989
01:47:24.180 --> 01:47:25.680
<v Speaker 3>We're not talking about cardio.</v>

3990
01:47:25.681 --> 01:47:26.580
<v Speaker 3>If she wanted to do cardio,</v>

3991
01:47:26.581 --> 01:47:27.450
<v Speaker 3>your muscle building.</v>

3992

<v Speaker 3>Well cause he's gonna bill you for sure.</v>

3993
01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:32.250
<v Speaker 3>Going to build a lot of muscle if you get stronger.</v>

3994
01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:35.550
<v Speaker 3>But there's a big difference between that and the hypertrophy if you are,</v>

3995
01:47:35.551 --> 01:47:37.410
<v Speaker 3>if you're trying to just gain weight,</v>

3996
01:47:37.860 --> 01:47:40.650
<v Speaker 3>he would trying to just get your muscles bigger and do like bodybuilding</v>

3997
01:47:40.651 --> 01:47:41.484
<v Speaker 3>exercises.</v>

3998
01:47:41.580 --> 01:47:43.230
<v Speaker 3>A lot of those dudes like to do pyramids.</v>

3999
01:47:43.770 --> 01:47:47.520
<v Speaker 3>They'll stack up the weight real high and then they dropped the weight down and</v>

4000
01:47:47.521 --> 01:47:49.740
<v Speaker 3>continue the reps until they have like almost no way,</v>

4001
01:47:49.950 --> 01:47:50.610
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

4002
01:47:50.610 --> 01:47:55.260
<v Speaker 3>But you know there's real questions as to whether or not that's a smart way to</v>

4003
01:47:55.261 --> 01:47:56.610
<v Speaker 3>train as an athlete.</v>

4004
01:47:56.940 --> 01:47:57.421
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>

4005
01:47:57.421 --> 01:47:59.970
<v Speaker 3>the idea being is that as an athlete,</v>

4006
01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:03.090
<v Speaker 3>say if you have a brutal strength and conditioning workout where you're doing</v>

4007
01:48:03.091 --> 01:48:05.040
<v Speaker 3>everything to fail your dead lifts to failure,</v>

4008
01:48:05.041 --> 01:48:06.480
<v Speaker 3>a clean press to failure,</v>

4009
01:48:06.630 --> 01:48:07.890
<v Speaker 3>curls to failure,</v>

4010
01:48:08.060 --> 01:48:08.461
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

4011
01:48:08.461 --> 01:48:12.270
<v Speaker 3>overhead press to failure the next day you're useless,</v>

4012
01:48:12.271 --> 01:48:13.090
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

4013
01:48:13.090 --> 01:48:13.923
<v Speaker 3>you're useless.</v>

4014
01:48:13.950 --> 01:48:15.900
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to be able to spar,</v>

4015
01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:16.771
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to be able to,</v>

4016
01:48:16.771 --> 01:48:16.900
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

4017
01:48:16.900 --> 01:48:17.221
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>

4018
01:48:17.221 --> 01:48:18.090
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get mauled.</v>

4019
01:48:18.150 --> 01:48:19.500
<v Speaker 3>But there's different phases for that.</v>

4020
01:48:19.501 --> 01:48:20.910
<v Speaker 3>I feel like there could be,</v>

4021
01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:22.020
<v Speaker 3>that's one way of looking at it.</v>

4022
01:48:22.021 --> 01:48:27.021
<v Speaker 3>But his way of looking at it is you do these workouts where you lift a small</v>

4023
01:48:27.211 --> 01:48:27.691
<v Speaker 3>percentage,</v>

4024
01:48:27.691 --> 01:48:29.550
<v Speaker 3>like half of what your,</v>

4025
01:48:29.700 --> 01:48:33.720
<v Speaker 3>what your actual Max would be in terms of repetitions and just take 10 minutes</v>

4026
01:48:33.721 --> 01:48:34.950
<v Speaker 3>off and then do that again.</v>

4027
01:48:35.130 --> 01:48:36.000
<v Speaker 3>10 10 minutes off.</v>

4028
01:48:36.030 --> 01:48:36.480
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

4029
01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:37.620
<v Speaker 3>And take a long time off.</v>

4030
01:48:37.621 --> 01:48:38.454
<v Speaker 3>And do that again.</v>

4031
01:48:38.610 --> 01:48:41.910
<v Speaker 3>And by that way you leave and you still have a lot left in the tank.</v>

4032
01:48:42.090 --> 01:48:42.601
<v Speaker 3>You walk it,</v>

4033
01:48:42.601 --> 01:48:44.130
<v Speaker 3>these guys are fucking going at it.</v>

4034
01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:44.970
<v Speaker 3>Got down.</v>

4035
01:48:44.970 --> 01:48:45.330
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

4036
01:48:45.330 --> 01:48:46.250
<v Speaker 3>Edson Barboza,</v>

4037
01:48:46.300 --> 01:48:47.001
<v Speaker 3>Benito diary,</v>

4038
01:48:47.001 --> 01:48:50.030
<v Speaker 3>which are throwing down days just coming straight food.</v>

4039
01:48:50.260 --> 01:48:51.060
<v Speaker 3>What was his car?</v>

4040
01:48:51.060 --> 01:48:52.350
<v Speaker 3>What about maxing out though?</v>

4041
01:48:52.710 --> 01:48:53.640
<v Speaker 3>What did they talk about with that?</v>

4042
01:48:53.650 --> 01:48:54.630
<v Speaker 3>You don't believe you should do it.</v>

4043
01:48:54.690 --> 01:48:57.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean you might want to do it every now and then just to find out where you</v>

4044
01:48:57.011 --> 01:48:57.840
<v Speaker 3>stand,</v>

4045
01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:01.230
<v Speaker 3>but it's not something that you should do on a regular basis for a workout.</v>

4046
01:49:01.231 --> 01:49:05.130
<v Speaker 3>Because I feel like a lot of sports are where you're maxing out your trying your</v>

4047
01:49:05.131 --> 01:49:05.970
<v Speaker 3>hardest if you're,</v>

4048
01:49:06.270 --> 01:49:08.130
<v Speaker 3>if you're fighting for sure if you're,</v>

4049
01:49:08.131 --> 01:49:08.730
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

4050
01:49:08.730 --> 01:49:10.380
<v Speaker 3>So it seems kind of intuitive,</v>

4051
01:49:10.390 --> 01:49:10.860
<v Speaker 3>like safe.</v>

4052
01:49:10.860 --> 01:49:12.280
<v Speaker 3>Why does it seem counterintuitive?</v>

4053
01:49:12.330 --> 01:49:13.350
<v Speaker 3>If you're doing strength,</v>

4054
01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:16.320
<v Speaker 3>if you're wrestling or you're doing Jiu Jitsu or you know,</v>

4055
01:49:16.321 --> 01:49:17.940
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times if you watch these guys,</v>

4056
01:49:18.030 --> 01:49:20.190
<v Speaker 3>they're spending a long time doing,</v>

4057
01:49:20.370 --> 01:49:25.080
<v Speaker 3>using their entire body and sort of probably in a maximum effort position,</v>

4058
01:49:25.081 --> 01:49:25.914
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4059
01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:27.600
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

4060
01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:31.170
<v Speaker 3>so if you're trying to get out of a body lock or you're okay,</v>

4061
01:49:31.230 --> 01:49:31.711
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

4062
01:49:31.711 --> 01:49:33.480
<v Speaker 3>Or you in the class you stuff failure.</v>

4063
01:49:33.481 --> 01:49:35.100
<v Speaker 3>When do you ever go to failure in a sport?</v>

4064
01:49:35.910 --> 01:49:36.743
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4065
01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:39.360
<v Speaker 3>well I don't,</v>

4066
01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:40.080
<v Speaker 3>I guess you don't,</v>

4067
01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:41.910
<v Speaker 3>you don't really go to muscle failure in a sport.</v>

4068
01:49:41.911 --> 01:49:43.320
<v Speaker 3>Where you do is you want to make sure those,</v>

4069
01:49:43.350 --> 01:49:46.680
<v Speaker 3>those muscles are strong and then you went to build up your technique.</v>

4070
01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:47.320
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4071
01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:47.780
<v Speaker 3>hi.</v>

4072
01:49:47.780 --> 01:49:48.050
<v Speaker 3>Kicked</v>

4073
01:49:48.050 --> 01:49:48.231
<v Speaker 1>by.</v>

4074
01:49:48.231 --> 01:49:49.064
<v Speaker 1>Barboza.</v>

4075
01:49:49.090 --> 01:49:49.440
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4076
01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:53.140
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to build up your technique and your endurance in the sport itself?</v>

4077
01:49:53.170 --> 01:49:55.360
<v Speaker 1>Like your ability to do rounds as a fighter,</v>

4078
01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:55.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4079
01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:58.300
<v Speaker 1>Grounds rolling in Jujitsu or what else?</v>

4080
01:49:58.360 --> 01:49:59.193
<v Speaker 1>Whatever else.</v>

4081
01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:00.220
<v Speaker 1>Other sport you're doing,</v>

4082
01:50:00.370 --> 01:50:03.700
<v Speaker 1>your real endurance training is probably going to come from sprints.</v>

4083
01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:06.610
<v Speaker 1>You're real endurance training is going to come from something different outside</v>

4084
01:50:06.611 --> 01:50:08.230
<v Speaker 1>of strength training that you're doing.</v>

4085
01:50:08.231 --> 01:50:11.560
<v Speaker 1>The sport itself is doing a sport itself or then again,</v>

4086
01:50:11.561 --> 01:50:13.390
<v Speaker 1>there's also argument for plyometrics,</v>

4087
01:50:13.810 --> 01:50:15.670
<v Speaker 1>which is a a great thing to do,</v>

4088
01:50:15.730 --> 01:50:19.120
<v Speaker 1>which is also sort of the same kind of result that you're getting from movement</v>

4089
01:50:19.121 --> 01:50:20.870
<v Speaker 1>training from a lot of other things that people,</v>

4090
01:50:20.871 --> 01:50:21.671
<v Speaker 1>what's plyometrics,</v>

4091
01:50:21.671 --> 01:50:22.301
<v Speaker 1>explosives,</v>

4092
01:50:22.301 --> 01:50:23.350
<v Speaker 1>jump box jumps,</v>

4093
01:50:23.351 --> 01:50:24.220
<v Speaker 1>jumping over hurdles.</v>

4094
01:50:24.540 --> 01:50:27.160
<v Speaker 1>If I said you can only do five exercises,</v>

4095
01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:28.500
<v Speaker 1>what would I say?</v>

4096
01:50:28.500 --> 01:50:28.800
<v Speaker 1>I'd say,</v>

4097
01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:29.380
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

4098
01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:30.520
<v Speaker 1>Because let's just say,</v>

4099
01:50:30.521 --> 01:50:33.610
<v Speaker 1>can I do five one of the five months when you writing a strength condition book,</v>

4100
01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:37.510
<v Speaker 1>I would say you should do more than five things because people don't have that</v>

4101
01:50:37.511 --> 01:50:38.170
<v Speaker 1>much time.</v>

4102
01:50:38.170 --> 01:50:39.820
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking people need to go fuck themselves.</v>

4103
01:50:39.821 --> 01:50:40.390
<v Speaker 1>Squats,</v>

4104
01:50:40.390 --> 01:50:41.051
<v Speaker 1>push ups,</v>

4105
01:50:41.051 --> 01:50:41.890
<v Speaker 1>pull ups,</v>

4106
01:50:42.790 --> 01:50:44.350
<v Speaker 1>don't ask any stupid questions.</v>

4107
01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:46.200
<v Speaker 1>Back squats,</v>

4108
01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:47.113
<v Speaker 1>dead lifts.</v>

4109
01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:48.071
<v Speaker 1>I'd say squats,</v>

4110
01:50:48.071 --> 01:50:48.491
<v Speaker 1>dead lifts,</v>

4111
01:50:48.491 --> 01:50:51.430
<v Speaker 1>Chin ups are huge and I think weighted chin ups or even more huge.</v>

4112
01:50:51.970 --> 01:50:53.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big believer in way to chin ups.</v>

4113
01:50:53.710 --> 01:50:55.240
<v Speaker 1>I love putting a one of those,</v>

4114
01:50:55.241 --> 01:50:59.050
<v Speaker 1>a dip belts on with a kettle bell in between my legs and doing chin ups that way</v>

4115
01:50:59.051 --> 01:50:59.700
<v Speaker 1>because it makes my,</v>

4116
01:50:59.700 --> 01:51:04.420
<v Speaker 1>my Max Chin ups go way higher and I do them with strict form none of that.</v>

4117
01:51:04.820 --> 01:51:07.990
<v Speaker 1>That airy fairy United to kick cross fell into Kipp.</v>

4118
01:51:08.050 --> 01:51:09.460
<v Speaker 1>Him being not kipper.</v>

4119
01:51:09.510 --> 01:51:09.650
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4120
01:51:09.650 --> 01:51:10.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm not kidding.</v>

4121
01:51:10.210 --> 01:51:11.620
<v Speaker 1>I had you pegged as a kept my brother.</v>

4122
01:51:11.710 --> 01:51:12.341
<v Speaker 1>You know what I think?</v>

4123
01:51:12.341 --> 01:51:17.140
<v Speaker 1>I think she'd be able to do strict form pull ups and find out how much endurance</v>

4124
01:51:17.141 --> 01:51:20.290
<v Speaker 1>you actually have in your arms without moving your legs with it and everything</v>

4125
01:51:20.291 --> 01:51:25.291
<v Speaker 1>else strict in the strong first and paddles a organization you have to be able</v>

4126
01:51:26.741 --> 01:51:29.170
<v Speaker 1>to do straight pull ups like,</v>

4127
01:51:29.380 --> 01:51:30.490
<v Speaker 1>like from the bottom,</v>

4128
01:51:30.610 --> 01:51:34.320
<v Speaker 1>full extension damp annealed Irish with a big kick to the body is bullying him.</v>

4129
01:51:34.330 --> 01:51:36.040
<v Speaker 1>He's going straight forward and let him tee off.</v>

4130
01:51:36.550 --> 01:51:37.690
<v Speaker 1>This is a crazy ass fight.</v>

4131
01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Nice knee to the body.</v>

4132
01:51:39.140 --> 01:51:39.890
<v Speaker 1>I feel it.</v>

4133
01:51:39.890 --> 01:51:42.840
<v Speaker 1>Diarrhea sambal guy or a a a Greco guy.</v>

4134
01:51:42.860 --> 01:51:44.590
<v Speaker 1>So richly to black belt in Jujitsu.</v>

4135
01:51:45.760 --> 01:51:48.340
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu is nasty and he's a hot field corp students.</v>

4136
01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:49.320
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

4137
01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:49.840
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

4138
01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:53.230
<v Speaker 1>kick to the body by Barboza Barboza so fucking fast.</v>

4139
01:51:54.180 --> 01:51:55.150
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] man.</v>

4140
01:51:55.720 --> 01:51:57.520
<v Speaker 1>Which when the standup game,</v>

4141
01:51:57.880 --> 01:51:58.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about all that.</v>

4142
01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:00.430
<v Speaker 1>It's close by.</v>

4143
01:52:00.431 --> 01:52:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Bose has been fighting a long time,</v>

4144
01:52:02.081 --> 01:52:02.890
<v Speaker 1>I feel like.</v>

4145
01:52:02.890 --> 01:52:03.311
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4146
01:52:03.311 --> 01:52:04.210
<v Speaker 1>lefthand by dairy.</v>

4147
01:52:04.211 --> 01:52:05.260
<v Speaker 1>Who's nice.</v>

4148
01:52:06.220 --> 01:52:10.150
<v Speaker 1>The thing about Barboza is he can just always turn out the lights with one shot.</v>

4149
01:52:10.750 --> 01:52:11.620
<v Speaker 1>He's explosive.</v>

4150
01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:12.820
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

4151
01:52:12.820 --> 01:52:16.630
<v Speaker 1>and he also does a lot of wild shit like head kicks and things that can take you</v>

4152
01:52:16.631 --> 01:52:17.411
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>

4153
01:52:17.411 --> 01:52:18.330
<v Speaker 1>She's the underdog.</v>

4154
01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:19.500
<v Speaker 1>I liked him as an underdog.</v>

4155
01:52:19.501 --> 01:52:20.380
<v Speaker 1>If I was betting on it,</v>

4156
01:52:20.980 --> 01:52:22.060
<v Speaker 1>it felt still fighting.</v>

4157
01:52:22.061 --> 01:52:22.820
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen him.</v>

4158
01:52:22.820 --> 01:52:23.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4159
01:52:23.010 --> 01:52:23.340
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4161
01:52:23.550 --> 01:52:25.060
<v Speaker 1>Just one killer.</v>

4162
01:52:25.510 --> 01:52:29.140
<v Speaker 1>You know he majored in theater school inside leg kick.</v>

4163
01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:29.510

01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:31.353
<v Speaker 1>Just fought.</v>

4166
01:52:31.370 --> 01:52:32.830
<v Speaker 1>Where did I learn to speak English?</v>

4167
01:52:33.620 --> 01:52:37.120

4168
01:52:37.130 --> 01:52:38.650
<v Speaker 1>but he did when his last fight did he not?</v>

4169
01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:39.633
<v Speaker 1>I believe he did.</v>

4170
01:52:40.410 --> 01:52:40.871
<v Speaker 1>Is it fun?</v>

4171
01:52:40.871 --> 01:52:41.401
<v Speaker 1>A little bit.</v>

4172
01:52:41.401 --> 01:52:42.340
<v Speaker 1>The Smart Guy Man.</v>

4173
01:52:42.341 --> 01:52:43.240
<v Speaker 1>Really smart guy</v>

4174

<v Speaker 1>up 19th and beat Alisandra Ricci.</v>

4175
01:52:47.630 --> 01:52:48.463

<v Speaker 1>He's tough as shit.</v>

4178
01:52:52.430 --> 01:52:56.660
<v Speaker 1>He took off so bought in flinch month ago.</v>

4179
01:52:56.750 --> 01:52:57.583

<v Speaker 1>Barbara is,</v>

4185
01:53:03.001 --> 01:53:04.710
<v Speaker 1>it might be the best kicker in this fucking division.</v>

4186
01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:05.340
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4187
01:53:05.340 --> 01:53:07.380
<v Speaker 1>You really saw that in the PR in the Pettis fight.</v>

4188
01:53:07.740 --> 01:53:10.720
<v Speaker 1>Can you think of another bet who would be a better kicker?</v>

4189
01:53:10.730 --> 01:53:12.990
<v Speaker 1>No Damn Damn.</v>

4190
01:53:12.991 --> 01:53:13.801
<v Speaker 1>But you know guys,</v>

4191
01:53:13.801 --> 01:53:14.460
<v Speaker 1>take it.</v>

4192
01:53:14.460 --> 01:53:15.500
<v Speaker 1>Look at this pod.</v>

4193
01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Jamie Varner fight.</v>

4194
01:53:17.170 --> 01:53:18.003
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

4195
01:53:19.700 --> 01:53:20.350
<v Speaker 1>Like wonder boy.</v>

4196
01:53:20.350 --> 01:53:22.500
<v Speaker 1>He is a phenomenal kick it different though.</v>

4197
01:53:22.710 --> 01:53:24.240
<v Speaker 1>As far as like leg kicks,</v>

4198
01:53:25.050 --> 01:53:25.883
<v Speaker 1>body cakes.</v>

4199
01:53:25.980 --> 01:53:27.930
<v Speaker 1>Barboza is number one for me.</v>

4200
01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:30.753
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4201
01:53:32.140 --> 01:53:34.480
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty goddamn good while eating over here.</v>

4202
01:53:36.060 --> 01:53:37.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to think of the really good kickers,</v>

4203
01:53:37.511 --> 01:53:38.500
<v Speaker 1>but as far as that,</v>

4204
01:53:38.700 --> 01:53:39.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4205
01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:39.140
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4206
01:53:39.140 --> 01:53:41.970
<v Speaker 1>I'll see cowboys amazing with this setups.</v>

4207
01:53:42.090 --> 01:53:43.600
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like Barboza and then yeah,</v>

4208
01:53:43.601 --> 01:53:45.760
<v Speaker 1>your Rodriguez on another universe do.</v>

4209
01:53:45.761 --> 01:53:46.630
<v Speaker 1>How about him and</v>

4210
01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:49.960
<v Speaker 1>huge jump.</v>

4211
01:53:52.100 --> 01:53:55.240
<v Speaker 1>That's such a big leap for a Dominick Cruz.</v>

4212
01:53:55.250 --> 01:53:58.090
<v Speaker 1>His point about how Frankie Edgar is,</v>

4213
01:53:58.720 --> 01:54:00.580
<v Speaker 1>you see a lot of fighters at once they start losing,</v>

4214
01:54:00.610 --> 01:54:01.660
<v Speaker 1>they never recover.</v>

4215
01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:05.710
<v Speaker 1>And then you see certain fighters like Frankie Edgar who even though they look</v>

4216
01:54:05.711 --> 01:54:06.610
<v Speaker 1>like they're down and out,</v>

4217
01:54:06.820 --> 01:54:09.160
<v Speaker 1>always find a way to come back in the fight.</v>

4218
01:54:09.220 --> 01:54:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4219
01:54:10.030 --> 01:54:10.241
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4220
01:54:10.241 --> 01:54:11.040
<v Speaker 1>There certain fighters,</v>

4221
01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:11.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4222
01:54:11.261 --> 01:54:11.681
<v Speaker 1>once they,</v>

4223
01:54:11.681 --> 01:54:13.060
<v Speaker 1>somebody else gets the advantage they,</v>

4224
01:54:13.150 --> 01:54:13.983
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4225
01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:16.930
<v Speaker 1>they tend to not be able to kind of come back from it.</v>

4226
01:54:17.410 --> 01:54:20.440
<v Speaker 1>And guys like frank cake or coffee all over myself.</v>

4227
01:54:21.170 --> 01:54:21.970
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

4228
01:54:21.970 --> 01:54:24.130
<v Speaker 1>This a coffee thing,</v>

4229
01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:26.440
<v Speaker 1>something happens with it when you press it.</v>

4230
01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:29.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh is that two full rang out?</v>

4231
01:54:29.380 --> 01:54:30.700
<v Speaker 1>A lot of pressure built up Joe.</v>

4232
01:54:30.910 --> 01:54:31.181
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4233
01:54:31.181 --> 01:54:33.920
<v Speaker 1>but why is it so I need to,</v>

4234
01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:34.721
<v Speaker 1>it's physics.</v>

4235
01:54:34.721 --> 01:54:36.810
<v Speaker 1>I need a pointer in a fucking carbon black board.</v>

4236
01:54:36.850 --> 01:54:37.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4237
01:54:37.030 --> 01:54:38.020
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't be faking.</v>

4239
01:54:38.980 --> 01:54:39.610

4240
01:54:39.610 --> 01:54:42.850
<v Speaker 1>You don't know how much physics I had to at least guys are banging man.</v>

4241
01:54:43.350 --> 01:54:43.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4266
01:55:13.810 --> 01:55:14.621
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to talk about it.</v>

4324
01:56:24.331 --> 01:56:24.900

<v Speaker 1>maybe lose.</v>

4326
01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:27.150
<v Speaker 1>Do you get in better shape,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

4329
01:56:33.630 --> 01:56:34.830
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing about Barboza.</v>

4330
01:56:34.831 --> 01:56:36.630
<v Speaker 1>As good as his fucking technique is,</v>

4331
01:56:36.631 --> 01:56:38.010
<v Speaker 1>as good as his kickboxing is,</v>

4332
01:56:38.340 --> 01:56:39.330
<v Speaker 1>he still gets tagged.</v>

4333
01:56:39.750 --> 01:56:40.660
<v Speaker 1>Everybody gets tagged.</v>

4334
01:56:40.661 --> 01:56:42.330
<v Speaker 1>This is a brutal goddamn sport.</v>

4335
01:56:42.610 --> 01:56:43.380
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

4336
01:56:43.380 --> 01:56:44.213
<v Speaker 1>Fucking canvas.</v>

4337
01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:44.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4338
01:56:44.521 --> 01:56:44.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4339
01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:45.541
<v Speaker 1>as good as he is,</v>

4340
01:56:45.541 --> 01:56:49.200
<v Speaker 1>as good as Barboza is the messiest canvas I've seen a lot.</v>

4341
01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Usually they clean that shit up for farms.</v>

4342
01:56:51.601 --> 01:56:54.030
<v Speaker 1>They spray it won a Tony for fights right there.</v>

4343
01:56:54.060 --> 01:56:54.770
<v Speaker 1>This is Fox.</v>

4344
01:56:54.770 --> 01:56:59.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh this is fs one fs one is not nearly the reach that big Fox as if that was big</v>

4345
01:56:59.941 --> 01:57:00.600
<v Speaker 1>Fox.</v>

4346
01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:02.400
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't have to torture us man.</v>

4347
01:57:02.580 --> 01:57:05.490
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why I hated doing big Fox is cause they would get out</v>

4348
01:57:05.491 --> 01:57:09.600
<v Speaker 1>there with spray paint and they would spray paint the fucking color on the</v>

4349
01:57:09.601 --> 01:57:12.150
<v Speaker 1>octagon all over that gray area and non toxic.</v>

4350
01:57:12.151 --> 01:57:12.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

4351
01:57:12.660 --> 01:57:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh it's brutal it but blow right over to your face.</v>

4352
01:57:15.031 --> 01:57:16.920
<v Speaker 1>You knew you were breathing in some horrible shit.</v>

4353
01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:20.340
<v Speaker 1>She's using real spray paint.</v>

4354
01:57:20.370 --> 01:57:21.203
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4355
01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:22.200
<v Speaker 1>It's totally illegal.</v>

4356
01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:25.440
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you it's some shit that they would do if they were like working on a</v>

4357
01:57:25.441 --> 01:57:26.340
<v Speaker 1>car somewhere.</v>

4358
01:57:26.810 --> 01:57:28.980
<v Speaker 1>You know it's terrible primer.</v>

4359
01:57:29.220 --> 01:57:31.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who authorized it.</v>

4360
01:57:31.380 --> 01:57:33.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why they were allowed to do it.</v>

4361
01:57:33.001 --> 01:57:38.001
<v Speaker 1>But we would be sitting there cage side and toxic fucking fumes from spray paint</v>

4362
01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:42.750
<v Speaker 1>or being blasted all over that canvas calling it the flood.</v>

4363
01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4364
01:57:43.560 --> 01:57:45.610
<v Speaker 1>They see want to see the blood cause they didn't want him to let go.</v>

4365
01:57:45.630 --> 01:57:46.381
<v Speaker 1>My God.</v>

4366
01:57:46.381 --> 01:57:47.490
<v Speaker 1>People on Big Fox.</v>

4367
01:57:47.491 --> 01:57:49.230
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want to admit what they're setting up.</v>

4368
01:57:49.231 --> 01:57:49.971
<v Speaker 1>God Damn it.</v>

4369
01:57:49.971 --> 01:57:50.804
<v Speaker 1>A bloody sport.</v>

4370
01:57:50.910 --> 01:57:54.600
<v Speaker 1>So you'd be sitting there doing commentary and you'd be coughing.</v>

4371
01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:57.240
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to like pull your shirt up above your face like this.</v>

4372
01:57:57.241 --> 01:57:58.350
<v Speaker 1>Like fucking Amen.</v>

01:59:57.371 --> 01:59:58.330
<v Speaker 2>He wanted to save Darya.</v>

4442

<v Speaker 2>That's a good breakfast.</v>

4443
01:59:59.191 --> 02:00:01.520
<v Speaker 2>So it wasn't Mario Yamasaki who is a referee?</v>

02:00:13.130 --> 02:00:17.350
<v Speaker 2>Probably his brother cause he really rich Franklin's brother used to do,</v>

4454
02:00:17.380 --> 02:00:19.600
<v Speaker 2>we used to referee and you look at me like,</v>

4455
02:00:19.601 --> 02:00:20.120

4458
02:00:25.540 --> 02:00:26.201
<v Speaker 2>Rich Frank.</v>

4459
02:00:26.201 --> 02:00:28.480
<v Speaker 2>Let's think about him the other day I was watching a replay at him verse</v>

4460
02:00:28.481 --> 02:00:29.950
<v Speaker 2>Anderson and Cincinnati.</v>

4461
02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:31.350
<v Speaker 2>He was such a fun fighter.</v>

4462
02:00:31.351 --> 02:00:33.690
<v Speaker 2>Maybe as a math teacher look like ace Ventura.</v>

4463
02:00:33.820 --> 02:00:34.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4464
02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:35.280
<v Speaker 2>that's his whole spiel.</v>

4465
02:00:35.890 --> 02:00:39.790
<v Speaker 2>You're a big tough motherfucker and one of the first guys to come in and insane,</v>

4466
02:00:39.791 --> 02:00:40.510
<v Speaker 2>insane,</v>

4467
02:00:40.510 --> 02:00:41.343
<v Speaker 2>insane,</v>

4468
02:00:41.350 --> 02:00:41.710
<v Speaker 2>surreal,</v>

4469
02:00:41.710 --> 02:00:42.760
<v Speaker 2>weird workout though.</v>

4470
02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:44.230
<v Speaker 2>I think today it would be,</v>

4471
02:00:44.290 --> 02:00:47.380
<v Speaker 2>it would be kind of frowned upon a lot of the exercises he was doing cause he</v>

4472
02:00:47.381 --> 02:00:51.250
<v Speaker 2>was doing a lot of like isolation exercises and really super high repetitions.</v>

4473
02:00:51.620 --> 02:00:51.880
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4474
02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:53.320
<v Speaker 2>you remember he was doing like machines,</v>

4475
02:00:53.321 --> 02:00:54.400
<v Speaker 2>like the isolation machine.</v>

4476
02:00:54.430 --> 02:00:56.020
<v Speaker 2>That's shit worked though for him.</v>

4477
02:00:56.050 --> 02:00:56.351
<v Speaker 2>For him.</v>

4478
02:00:56.351 --> 02:00:58.000
<v Speaker 2>It worked until aunt Sylvia came along.</v>

4479
02:00:58.100 --> 02:00:58.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4480

02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:07.593
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

4487
02:01:07.610 --> 02:01:09.870
<v Speaker 2>Look at this card Weidman versus Musashi.</v>

4488
02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:11.470
<v Speaker 2>April 8th did you see the poster?</v>

<v Speaker 1>It looks like to me and they looked very similar.</v>

4539
02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:10.740
<v Speaker 1>It looks super similar.</v>

4540
02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:11.623
<v Speaker 1>Google it.</v>

4541
02:02:11.630 --> 02:02:13.220
<v Speaker 1>You might be racist as fuck though.</v>

4542
02:02:13.310 --> 02:02:14.430
<v Speaker 1>There might be a shitload them know.</v>

4543
02:02:14.431 --> 02:02:16.160
<v Speaker 1>It's weird like you can say it's racist,</v>

4544
02:02:16.161 --> 02:02:17.660
<v Speaker 1>but that dude is white as fuck.</v>

4545
02:02:17.730 --> 02:02:17.970
<v Speaker 1>Yea.</v>

4546
02:02:17.970 --> 02:02:20.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like there it is.</v>

4547
02:02:20.061 --> 02:02:20.750
<v Speaker 1>Look at the dots.</v>

4548
02:02:20.750 --> 02:02:22.070
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Johnson poster.</v>

4549
02:02:22.250 --> 02:02:23.001
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't see it.</v>

4550
02:02:23.001 --> 02:02:23.630
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

4551
02:02:23.630 --> 02:02:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Well that's crazy.</v>

4552
02:02:30.420 --> 02:02:31.260
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous.</v>

4553
02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:32.091
<v Speaker 1>Weird.</v>

4554
02:02:32.091 --> 02:02:32.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4555
02:02:32.611 --> 02:02:34.730
<v Speaker 1>That's red and shit.</v>

4556
02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:36.380
<v Speaker 1>Whoever did that should get fired.</v>

4557
02:02:36.970 --> 02:02:41.630
<v Speaker 1>The Post is ridiculous cause you know off the Johnson's are knocked out artists</v>

4558
02:02:41.631 --> 02:02:42.440
<v Speaker 1>and he's winning.</v>

4559
02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:46.530
<v Speaker 1>But DC your Chapman and he beat him before Johnson's looming over him.</v>

4560
02:02:46.531 --> 02:02:49.160
<v Speaker 1>I guess they fought before.</v>

4561
02:02:49.550 --> 02:02:50.121
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>

4562
02:02:50.121 --> 02:02:53.720
<v Speaker 1>Is this the same reason why that Ronda Rousey video was all Rhonda and very</v>

4563
02:02:53.721 --> 02:02:55.640
<v Speaker 1>little about Amanda Nunez?</v>

4564
02:02:55.641 --> 02:02:56.370
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult.</v>

4565
02:02:56.370 --> 02:02:57.650
<v Speaker 1>Neither one of them's a draw.</v>

4566
02:02:58.100 --> 02:02:58.790
<v Speaker 1>So does it.</v>

4567
02:02:58.790 --> 02:02:58.971
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4568
02:02:58.971 --> 02:03:00.590
<v Speaker 1>you don't think people want to see rumble fight?</v>

4569
02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:01.851
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

4570
02:03:01.851 --> 02:03:02.200
<v Speaker 1>But if,</v>

4571
02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:04.730
<v Speaker 1>if like just a rumble fights on a big draw.</v>

4572
02:03:04.790 --> 02:03:05.511
<v Speaker 1>I mean you do.</v>

4573
02:03:05.511 --> 02:03:06.260
<v Speaker 1>I love Vermont.</v>

4574
02:03:06.260 --> 02:03:06.470
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

4575
02:03:06.470 --> 02:03:08.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm not complaining about robot and rumble.</v>

4576
02:03:08.391 --> 02:03:11.390
<v Speaker 1>Fight for the title is different than anybody else fighting for the title</v>

4577
02:03:11.391 --> 02:03:11.751
<v Speaker 1>rumble.</v>

4578
02:03:11.751 --> 02:03:14.150
<v Speaker 1>Johnson numbers would be on my side on this argument.</v>

4579
02:03:14.151 --> 02:03:14.540
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

4580
02:03:14.540 --> 02:03:15.291
<v Speaker 1>not an argument.</v>

4581
02:03:15.291 --> 02:03:17.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying like he doesn't pull in huge numbers paper.</v>

4582
02:03:18.380 --> 02:03:19.400
<v Speaker 1>I think you're probably right,</v>

4583
02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:22.250
<v Speaker 1>but I think he has the potential to be a massive star and that's what they're</v>

4584
02:03:22.251 --> 02:03:23.280
<v Speaker 1>seeing with is not the way.</v>

4585
02:03:23.540 --> 02:03:23.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4586
02:03:23.741 --> 02:03:25.020
<v Speaker 1>The way he puts guys to sleep.</v>

4587
02:03:25.180 --> 02:03:25.750
<v Speaker 1>Johnson,</v>

4588
02:03:25.750 --> 02:03:26.720
<v Speaker 1>I think rumble Johnson.</v>

4589
02:03:27.170 --> 02:03:29.960
<v Speaker 1>John Jones House more than rumble Johnson.</v>

4590
02:03:29.961 --> 02:03:30.794
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Cormay.</v>

4591
02:03:31.150 --> 02:03:32.700
<v Speaker 1>Well they fought and beat them.</v>

4592
02:03:32.730 --> 02:03:33.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4593
02:03:33.090 --> 02:03:33.830
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>

4594
02:03:33.830 --> 02:03:35.510
<v Speaker 1>What could his timing on his fucking knee,</v>

4595
02:03:35.810 --> 02:03:36.290
<v Speaker 1>but dude,</v>

4596
02:03:36.290 --> 02:03:37.420
<v Speaker 1>Uhm,</v>

4597
02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:39.170
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

4598
02:03:39.230 --> 02:03:43.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's about as perfect and knee is anybody's ever thrown in life.</v>

4599
02:03:43.420 --> 02:03:45.170
<v Speaker 1>That's a perfect timing.</v>

4600
02:03:45.320 --> 02:03:48.740
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't winning that fight before that crazy lot of my card.</v>

4601
02:03:49.030 --> 02:03:49.131
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4602
02:03:49.131 --> 02:03:50.240
<v Speaker 1>well I didn't have a card.</v>

4603
02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:50.901
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a card?</v>

4604
02:03:50.901 --> 02:03:51.021
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4605
02:03:51.021 --> 02:03:51.501
<v Speaker 1>I'm right here.</v>

4606
02:03:51.501 --> 02:03:52.334
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

4607
02:03:52.500 --> 02:03:54.450
<v Speaker 1>And that ref MVP.</v>

4608
02:03:55.550 --> 02:03:57.380
<v Speaker 1>Damn Edson Barboza was a beast.</v>

4609
02:03:57.950 --> 02:03:58.581
<v Speaker 1>Number five.</v>

4610
02:03:58.581 --> 02:03:59.930
<v Speaker 1>Just be Dariusz knocked him out.</v>

4611
02:03:59.970 --> 02:04:01.280
<v Speaker 1>He was a fun one coming up.</v>

4612
02:04:01.340 --> 02:04:02.660
<v Speaker 1>What a crazy division.</v>

4613
02:04:02.661 --> 02:04:05.130
<v Speaker 1>That one 55 is boiling murder,</v>

4614
02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

4615
02:04:06.190 --> 02:04:07.700
<v Speaker 1>That shit together.</v>

4616
02:04:07.910 --> 02:04:08.241
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

4617
02:04:08.241 --> 02:04:11.240
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to do everything because even this guy gets out of work by</v>

4618
02:04:11.241 --> 02:04:11.690
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

4619
02:04:11.690 --> 02:04:12.021
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4620
02:04:12.021 --> 02:04:12.680
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4621
02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:16.190
<v Speaker 1>He's lost some big hello pedis pedis now has to come back to this shit and joy.</v>

4622
02:04:16.191 --> 02:04:16.850
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

4623
02:04:16.850 --> 02:04:17.683
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4624
02:04:18.260 --> 02:04:19.340
<v Speaker 1>but 55 for him,</v>

4625
02:04:19.490 --> 02:04:23.570
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't really have that bad of a run at 55 plus couple decisions.</v>

4626
02:04:23.630 --> 02:04:24.111
<v Speaker 1>Oh listen,</v>

4627
02:04:24.111 --> 02:04:27.620
<v Speaker 1>when he was on top of 55 when he knocked out cowboy Cerrone with that body kick</v>

4628
02:04:28.130 --> 02:04:28.581
<v Speaker 1>knocked out,</v>

4629
02:04:28.581 --> 02:04:33.581
<v Speaker 1>Joe Lozan tapped out and Benson Henderson to win the title.</v>

4630
02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:34.930
<v Speaker 1>He can still do work.</v>

4631
02:04:34.940 --> 02:04:35.420
<v Speaker 1>He's still,</v>

4632
02:04:35.420 --> 02:04:36.253
<v Speaker 1>he's a beast.</v>

4633
02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:38.880
<v Speaker 1>He's a beast of an athlete and he's still fairly young.</v>

4634
02:04:38.970 --> 02:04:40.380
<v Speaker 1>I feel like with a guy like that,</v>

4635
02:04:40.620 --> 02:04:41.670
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

4636
02:04:41.700 --> 02:04:46.700
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like he has to take some time and get his body to the perfect weight</v>

4637
02:04:47.190 --> 02:04:50.070
<v Speaker 1>and strength to compete at one 55 thing.</v>

4638
02:04:50.070 --> 02:04:50.251
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

4639
02:04:50.251 --> 02:04:50.671
<v Speaker 1>where's he at?</v>

4640
02:04:50.671 --> 02:04:52.770
<v Speaker 1>Mentally like he's been to the top of Everest.</v>

4641
02:04:52.771 --> 02:04:53.390
<v Speaker 1>He stayed.</v>

4642
02:04:53.390 --> 02:04:54.570
<v Speaker 1>He's put the flag in there.</v>

4643
02:04:54.840 --> 02:04:56.100
<v Speaker 1>You know what it takes to get there.</v>

4644
02:04:56.101 --> 02:04:57.270
<v Speaker 1>Do you still want to do that?</v>

4645
02:04:57.380 --> 02:04:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Like you've been through all this,</v>

4646
02:04:58.651 --> 02:05:01.770
<v Speaker 1>do you really want to restart from the bottom and go up and you can tell what</v>

4647
02:05:01.771 --> 02:05:02.461
<v Speaker 1>it's like up there?</v>

4648
02:05:02.461 --> 02:05:03.294
<v Speaker 1>Is it any different?</v>

4649

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4650

4698
02:06:06.360 --> 02:06:07.440
<v Speaker 1>It's not set yet.</v>

02:06:39.790 --> 02:06:40.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4720
02:06:40.111 --> 02:06:41.700
<v Speaker 1>a real bad ass and the division,</v>

4721
02:06:41.850 --> 02:06:45.570
<v Speaker 1>the real fight in the car that I'm interested in the most honestly is Frankie</v>

4722
02:06:45.570 --> 02:06:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Edgar versus Yahya Rodriguez.</v>

4723
02:06:46.771 --> 02:06:49.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking forward to that as much as Damien Maia math.</v>

4724
02:06:49.231 --> 02:06:50.470
<v Speaker 1>But the hall is much thinner.</v>

4725
02:06:50.480 --> 02:06:51.630
<v Speaker 1>That's going sizzler.</v>

4726
02:06:51.660 --> 02:06:51.931
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4727
02:06:51.931 --> 02:06:52.710
<v Speaker 1>but dude,</v>

4728
02:06:52.710 --> 02:06:56.640
<v Speaker 1>Yani Rodriguez is doing some crazy street fighter shit in there.</v>

4729
02:06:56.880 --> 02:06:57.780
<v Speaker 1>I want to sin.</v>

4730
02:06:57.900 --> 02:07:01.170
<v Speaker 1>I want to see what he could do to Frankie if he can land a three 60 roundhouse</v>

4731
02:07:01.171 --> 02:07:02.070
<v Speaker 1>kick on Frankie Edgar.</v>

4732
02:07:02.071 --> 02:07:02.730
<v Speaker 1>We've got a party.</v>

4733
02:07:02.730 --> 02:07:03.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that fight son.</v>

4734
02:07:04.080 --> 02:07:06.630
<v Speaker 1>The parties with a steep a dos Santos.</v>

4735
02:07:06.690 --> 02:07:07.560
<v Speaker 1>That's the party too,</v>

4736
02:07:07.580 --> 02:07:08.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4737
02:07:08.400 --> 02:07:09.233
<v Speaker 1>Did that.</v>

4738
02:07:09.390 --> 02:07:11.370
<v Speaker 1>And it was a close fight.</v>

4739
02:07:11.460 --> 02:07:12.000
<v Speaker 1>Mad,</v>

4740
02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:15.640
<v Speaker 1>sad face May 13th it's a while.</v>

4741
02:07:15.750 --> 02:07:15.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4742
02:07:15.961 --> 02:07:17.280
<v Speaker 1>When you get punched to changes.</v>

4743
02:07:17.310 --> 02:07:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4744
02:07:17.820 --> 02:07:18.230
<v Speaker 1>When?</v>

4745
02:07:18.230 --> 02:07:21.060
<v Speaker 1>When Cain Velasquez fucking 10 rises your faith for tenants,</v>

4746
02:07:21.570 --> 02:07:22.590
<v Speaker 1>he looks more and more evil.</v>

4747
02:07:22.591 --> 02:07:23.760
<v Speaker 1>He looks like he's the guy,</v>

4748
02:07:23.790 --> 02:07:26.320
<v Speaker 1>couldn't be the nice and couldn't get any nicer night day.</v>

4749
02:07:27.630 --> 02:07:29.250
<v Speaker 1>That'd be the most friendliest guy in the world.</v>

4750
02:07:30.030 --> 02:07:31.020
<v Speaker 1>Steve is a good dude too,</v>

4751
02:07:31.021 --> 02:07:32.490
<v Speaker 1>but that's a great fucking fight</v>

4752
02:07:34.730 --> 02:07:35.563
<v Speaker 1>they're to do.</v>

4753
02:07:35.590 --> 02:07:38.290
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to do Eddie Alvarez versus Ferguson first one like,</v>

4754
02:07:38.291 --> 02:07:38.681
<v Speaker 1>Nah man,</v>

4755
02:07:38.681 --> 02:07:42.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm waiting for this title shot on Eddie to look at Shogun.</v>

4756
02:07:43.020 --> 02:07:44.470
<v Speaker 1>The network looks kind of strange.</v>

4757
02:07:44.490 --> 02:07:45.200
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4758
02:07:45.200 --> 02:07:47.570
<v Speaker 1>it looks real slow doing it for the cameras fellas.</v>

4759
02:07:47.770 --> 02:07:48.461
<v Speaker 1>They're warming up,</v>

4760
02:07:48.461 --> 02:07:48.850
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

4761
02:07:48.850 --> 02:07:49.683
<v Speaker 1>But they come in,</v>

4762
02:07:49.780 --> 02:07:51.010
<v Speaker 1>they might already warmed up and they,</v>

4763
02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:51.910
<v Speaker 1>when they come in they go,</v>

4764
02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:52.300
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

4765
02:07:52.300 --> 02:07:54.010
<v Speaker 1>we're going to get you now on film and just,</v>

4766
02:07:54.070 --> 02:07:54.721
<v Speaker 1>you're almost called,</v>

4767
02:07:54.721 --> 02:07:55.630
<v Speaker 1>you stand up and you're not,</v>

4768
02:07:55.660 --> 02:07:56.560
<v Speaker 1>this isn't real.</v>

4769
02:07:56.680 --> 02:07:58.240
<v Speaker 1>That guy to the ride has been</v>

4770
02:08:00.610 --> 02:08:01.840
<v Speaker 1>plus you don't want to show it too much.</v>

4771
02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:02.890
<v Speaker 1>That's a crazy fight though.</v>

4772
02:08:02.891 --> 02:08:05.200
<v Speaker 1>Shogun has been in so many wars.</v>

4773
02:08:05.450 --> 02:08:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4774
02:08:05.940 --> 02:08:06.431
<v Speaker 1>you always like,</v>

4775
02:08:06.431 --> 02:08:08.230
<v Speaker 1>how many more warrants can that guy be in?</v>

4776
02:08:09.480 --> 02:08:09.830
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

4777
02:08:09.830 --> 02:08:10.663
<v Speaker 1>what's this</v>

4778
02:08:13.930 --> 02:08:15.220
<v Speaker 1>kicking ass again,</v>

4779
02:08:15.640 --> 02:08:15.841
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

4780
02:08:15.841 --> 02:08:17.770
<v Speaker 1>she's babied us constantly kicking ass.</v>

4781
02:08:17.771 --> 02:08:18.880
<v Speaker 1>She's super body though.</v>

4782
02:08:19.810 --> 02:08:20.081
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

4783
02:08:20.081 --> 02:08:21.100
<v Speaker 1>She got them robot tits.</v>

4784
02:08:21.101 --> 02:08:21.551
<v Speaker 1>Hey guys,</v>

4785
02:08:21.551 --> 02:08:21.911
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

4786
02:08:21.911 --> 02:08:22.720
<v Speaker 1>It's bad.</v>

4787
02:08:22.720 --> 02:08:23.560
<v Speaker 1>Don't be misogynist.</v>

4788
02:08:23.890 --> 02:08:24.723
<v Speaker 1>It's women's mom.</v>

4789
02:08:25.950 --> 02:08:26.750
<v Speaker 1>I have to check.</v>

4790
02:08:26.750 --> 02:08:27.760
<v Speaker 1>What is the misogyny?</v>

4791
02:08:27.880 --> 02:08:29.320
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean like you hate women?</v>

4792
02:08:30.790 --> 02:08:31.770
<v Speaker 1>She say she has a nice,</v>

4793
02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:33.230
<v Speaker 1>it does not mean your massage.</v>

4794
02:08:33.500 --> 02:08:33.840
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4795
02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:34.140
<v Speaker 1>she went,</v>

4796
02:08:34.140 --> 02:08:34.631
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

4797
02:08:34.631 --> 02:08:35.464
<v Speaker 1>you have some nice,</v>

4798
02:08:35.860 --> 02:08:36.710
<v Speaker 1>but if you say she,</v>

4799
02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:37.471
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4800
02:08:37.471 --> 02:08:37.811
<v Speaker 1>If she,</v>

4801
02:08:37.811 --> 02:08:39.530
<v Speaker 1>you say she's got some nice to ties.</v>

4802
02:08:39.820 --> 02:08:40.510
<v Speaker 1>That's being real.</v>

4803
02:08:40.510 --> 02:08:42.520
<v Speaker 1>Is that kind of problem with the way the flashiness,</v>

4804
02:08:42.530 --> 02:08:44.530
<v Speaker 1>the way the left brands,</v>

4805
02:08:44.531 --> 02:08:47.470
<v Speaker 1>any kind of like the narrative of feminism,</v>

4806
02:08:47.471 --> 02:08:49.480
<v Speaker 1>like a femme women are victims.</v>

4807
02:08:49.510 --> 02:08:54.430
<v Speaker 1>Men are oppressors and toxic and predators and you can't have a discussion from</v>

4808
02:08:54.431 --> 02:08:54.850
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

4809
02:08:54.850 --> 02:08:57.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like just cause I think a woman's beautiful and I compliment her or she</v>

4810
02:08:57.761 --> 02:08:58.810
<v Speaker 1>turns me on.</v>

4811
02:08:59.160 --> 02:09:00.820
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean I want to oppress her.</v>

4812
02:09:00.821 --> 02:09:02.290
<v Speaker 1>It just means they want to have sex with her.</v>

4813
02:09:02.291 --> 02:09:04.000
<v Speaker 1>I feel like we turned the corner on that.</v>

4814
02:09:04.600 --> 02:09:06.480
<v Speaker 1>I feel like we're turning the corner on the team yet.</v>

4815
02:09:06.481 --> 02:09:07.060
<v Speaker 1>We haven't.</v>

4816
02:09:07.060 --> 02:09:07.331
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4817
02:09:07.331 --> 02:09:09.400
<v Speaker 1>But I think that they're being critiqued on a,</v>

4818
02:09:09.401 --> 02:09:11.710
<v Speaker 1>on a level that they've never really been critiqued it.</v>

4819
02:09:11.740 --> 02:09:12.360
<v Speaker 1>Good,</v>

4820
02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:12.670
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

4821
02:09:12.670 --> 02:09:13.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad to hear that.</v>

4822
02:09:13.600 --> 02:09:13.901
<v Speaker 1>Don't mean,</v>

4823
02:09:13.901 --> 02:09:14.470
<v Speaker 1>don't you think,</v>

4824
02:09:14.470 --> 02:09:16.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean with the kind of scrutiny that they receive online?</v>

4825
02:09:17.110 --> 02:09:17.950
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

4826
02:09:17.951 --> 02:09:20.710
<v Speaker 1>The problem is I think most of us are living in our own echo chambers.</v>

4827
02:09:20.711 --> 02:09:24.550
<v Speaker 1>I think the biggest problem with online online stuff is that most of us are able</v>

4828
02:09:24.551 --> 02:09:25.870
<v Speaker 1>to create our own echo chambers.</v>

4829
02:09:26.290 --> 02:09:27.490
<v Speaker 1>And so there isn't enough,</v>

4830
02:09:27.640 --> 02:09:27.971
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4831
02:09:27.971 --> 02:09:32.920
<v Speaker 1>exchange of ideas and I think we all need to kind of open up and I think you</v>

4832
02:09:32.921 --> 02:09:37.030
<v Speaker 1>should listen to the people you disagree with as much as you possibly can to see</v>

4833
02:09:37.031 --> 02:09:40.450
<v Speaker 1>what you don't like about them and what they're really saying.</v>

4834
02:09:40.660 --> 02:09:42.070
<v Speaker 1>If you rely on just the media,</v>

4835
02:09:42.250 --> 02:09:43.680
<v Speaker 1>what they're gonna do is they're going to,</v>

4836
02:09:43.720 --> 02:09:47.530
<v Speaker 1>they're going to highlight four sentences that you said over and over.</v>

4837
02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:51.040
<v Speaker 1>And what the biggest problem we have is that you can say one sentence and people</v>

4838
02:09:51.041 --> 02:09:55.240
<v Speaker 1>brand this very complex human being who is always changing day to day and</v>

4839
02:09:55.241 --> 02:09:56.560
<v Speaker 1>they'll brand you with the label.</v>

4840
02:09:56.710 --> 02:09:57.580
<v Speaker 1>You're a sexist,</v>

4841
02:09:57.610 --> 02:09:58.443
<v Speaker 1>you're a racist,</v>

4842
02:09:58.450 --> 02:09:59.080
<v Speaker 1>you're Amazon.</v>

4843
02:09:59.080 --> 02:09:59.291
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4844
02:09:59.291 --> 02:10:00.400
<v Speaker 1>human beings are very different.</v>

4845
02:10:00.401 --> 02:10:00.641
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

4846
02:10:00.641 --> 02:10:01.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm very different day to day.</v>

4847
02:10:01.691 --> 02:10:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Some depending on my mood,</v>

4848
02:10:02.621 --> 02:10:03.700
<v Speaker 1>I say some fucked up shit.</v>

4849
02:10:03.910 --> 02:10:06.280
<v Speaker 1>Then I say some really nice things and depending on how I feel,</v>

4850
02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:11.470
<v Speaker 1>but I know who I am defining people through a few tweets or a blog or article or</v>

4851
02:10:11.471 --> 02:10:12.304
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

4852
02:10:12.390 --> 02:10:14.380
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about a human's entire life.</v>

4853
02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:15.221
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

4854
02:10:15.221 --> 02:10:16.600
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't move ideas forward.</v>

4855
02:10:16.990 --> 02:10:19.720
<v Speaker 1>What's also the reality of censorship?</v>

4856
02:10:20.110 --> 02:10:20.591
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're,</v>

4857
02:10:20.591 --> 02:10:25.120
<v Speaker 1>you're attempting to instead of debate people and their ideas and offer superior</v>

4858
02:10:25.121 --> 02:10:25.954
<v Speaker 1>ideas yeah.</v>

4859
02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:28.060
<v Speaker 1>And put your ideas to the test instead of doing that,</v>

4860
02:10:28.180 --> 02:10:29.680
<v Speaker 1>they want to silence speech.</v>

4861
02:10:29.770 --> 02:10:30.550
<v Speaker 1>So they want us,</v>

4862
02:10:30.550 --> 02:10:32.620
<v Speaker 1>they want to stop people like Jordan Peterson.</v>

4863
02:10:32.650 --> 02:10:33.000
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

4864
02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:33.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4865
02:10:33.740 --> 02:10:37.560
<v Speaker 1>a university just called them transphobic and to try to get him kicked off of a</v>

4866
02:10:37.950 --> 02:10:39.450
<v Speaker 1>thing and go get it was I think they are,</v>

4867
02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:40.393
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in,</v>

4868
02:10:40.490 --> 02:10:41.840
<v Speaker 1>I want to say it was in Dublin.</v>

4869
02:10:41.870 --> 02:10:44.360
<v Speaker 1>Charles Murray will speak at the university.</v>

4870
02:10:44.650 --> 02:10:47.030
<v Speaker 1>Well a lot of people have not been allowed to speak recently.</v>

4871
02:10:47.210 --> 02:10:48.460
<v Speaker 1>And in these leftists universities,</v>

4872
02:10:48.461 --> 02:10:51.440
<v Speaker 1>they won't even let you speak because you have a different idea because you</v>

4873
02:10:51.441 --> 02:10:54.440
<v Speaker 1>might have an idea that grates against the common orthodoxy.</v>

4874
02:10:54.840 --> 02:10:56.450
<v Speaker 1>And Jordan Peterson by the way,</v>

4875
02:10:56.451 --> 02:10:58.510
<v Speaker 1>is anything but transphobic.</v>

4876
02:10:58.520 --> 02:10:59.630
<v Speaker 1>He's absolutely not.</v>

4877
02:10:59.631 --> 02:11:02.210
<v Speaker 1>And the only thing that he said is he doesn't want to use a bunch of made up</v>

4878
02:11:02.211 --> 02:11:04.810
<v Speaker 1>gender stereotypes or gender pronouns,</v>

4879
02:11:04.820 --> 02:11:05.210
<v Speaker 1>brother.</v>

4880
02:11:05.210 --> 02:11:08.630
<v Speaker 1>Or how about the fact that I have to give you verbal consent and bets.</v>

4881
02:11:08.631 --> 02:11:10.790
<v Speaker 1>You're getting into my bedroom telling me how to speak.</v>

4882
02:11:11.090 --> 02:11:11.480
<v Speaker 1>It did,</v>

4883
02:11:11.480 --> 02:11:12.140
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

4884
02:11:12.140 --> 02:11:12.621
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

4885
02:11:12.621 --> 02:11:13.454
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4886
02:11:13.490 --> 02:11:16.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we've seen anything like this and that's the problem.</v>

4887
02:11:16.101 --> 02:11:16.271
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

4888
02:11:16.271 --> 02:11:19.700
<v Speaker 1>it has to be fought against it just because it's a form of tyranny.</v>

4889
02:11:19.970 --> 02:11:20.721
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

4890
02:11:20.721 --> 02:11:21.380
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

4891
02:11:21.380 --> 02:11:21.701
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4892
02:11:21.701 --> 02:11:22.220
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4893
02:11:22.220 --> 02:11:22.820
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4894
02:11:22.820 --> 02:11:26.600
<v Speaker 1>the reason a lot of the liberal press has lost their credibility is because they</v>

4895
02:11:26.601 --> 02:11:29.660
<v Speaker 1>harp on they'll brand like think about even with Trump,</v>

4896
02:11:29.661 --> 02:11:30.494
<v Speaker 1>well I'm not a fan,</v>

4897
02:11:30.530 --> 02:11:31.363
<v Speaker 1>a fan of,</v>

4898
02:11:31.610 --> 02:11:35.340
<v Speaker 1>they brand him all of these things where it's kind of the how,</v>

4899
02:11:35.350 --> 02:11:37.080
<v Speaker 1>what are we supposed to do with that kind of when you,</v>

4900
02:11:37.100 --> 02:11:41.360
<v Speaker 1>when you call somebody that is it over now or we just done with that person or</v>

4901
02:11:41.361 --> 02:11:41.721
<v Speaker 1>is there a,</v>

4902
02:11:41.721 --> 02:11:43.880
<v Speaker 1>is there a smarter way to break somebody down?</v>

4903
02:11:44.560 --> 02:11:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4904
02:11:45.710 --> 02:11:46.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

4905
02:11:46.490 --> 02:11:46.800
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4906
02:11:46.800 --> 02:11:48.230
<v Speaker 1>it's especially at the left.</v>

4907
02:11:48.231 --> 02:11:49.880
<v Speaker 1>I love how the left tries to,</v>

4908
02:11:50.180 --> 02:11:50.361
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4909
02:11:50.361 --> 02:11:51.270
<v Speaker 1>speaking of like if you,</v>

4910
02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:52.340
<v Speaker 1>if you dislike Trump,</v>

4911
02:11:52.700 --> 02:11:54.920
<v Speaker 1>the way I would fight Trump is I would do this.</v>

4912
02:11:54.980 --> 02:11:55.550
<v Speaker 1>I would go,</v>

4913
02:11:55.550 --> 02:11:56.420
<v Speaker 1>he's not a Democrat,</v>

4914
02:11:56.810 --> 02:11:58.400
<v Speaker 1>he's not a Republican.</v>

4915
02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:00.890
<v Speaker 1>He's not even an American.</v>

4916
02:12:00.891 --> 02:12:01.724
<v Speaker 1>He's a Trumpist.</v>

4917
02:12:01.730 --> 02:12:02.660
<v Speaker 1>He's a monarch.</v>

4918
02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:04.730
<v Speaker 1>That's how you get the second amendment guys on your side.</v>

4919
02:12:04.731 --> 02:12:07.860
<v Speaker 1>If you're a liberal and you want to get the other people on your side,</v>

4920
02:12:08.030 --> 02:12:08.900
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work that way.</v>

4921
02:12:08.910 --> 02:12:10.320
<v Speaker 1>You can a second amendment guys,</v>

4922
02:12:10.370 --> 02:12:11.210
<v Speaker 1>if he supports them,</v>

4923
02:12:11.650 --> 02:12:12.990
<v Speaker 1>frame the left doesn't,</v>

4924
02:12:13.140 --> 02:12:15.170
<v Speaker 1>the left doesn't support second amendment rights.</v>

4925
02:12:15.470 --> 02:12:16.700
<v Speaker 1>So if he does,</v>

4926
02:12:16.730 --> 02:12:17.563
<v Speaker 1>he gets them.</v>

4927
02:12:17.750 --> 02:12:18.770
<v Speaker 1>It's really that simple.</v>

4928
02:12:18.830 --> 02:12:21.350
<v Speaker 1>Or you frame the debate a different way.</v>

4929
02:12:21.470 --> 02:12:21.831
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4930
02:12:21.831 --> 02:12:24.170
<v Speaker 1>So so your be more fair about,</v>

4931
02:12:24.171 --> 02:12:27.800
<v Speaker 1>be more specific and detailed on how you criticize somebody.</v>

4932
02:12:27.801 --> 02:12:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Forget Trump.</v>

4933
02:12:28.250 --> 02:12:31.910
<v Speaker 1>Anybody know what you don't like about that person?</v>

4934
02:12:32.150 --> 02:12:34.340
<v Speaker 1>Because there's a lot to like about a lot of people,</v>

4935
02:12:34.341 --> 02:12:35.330
<v Speaker 1>even if they're assholes.</v>

4936
02:12:35.450 --> 02:12:36.080
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

4937
02:12:36.080 --> 02:12:38.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean the people are complicated,</v>

4938
02:12:38.870 --> 02:12:39.171
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4939
02:12:39.171 --> 02:12:40.220
<v Speaker 1>We all have friends and they,</v>

4940
02:12:40.250 --> 02:12:43.820
<v Speaker 1>all of us have friends that we love and they have aspects of their personality.</v>

4941
02:12:43.850 --> 02:12:45.140
<v Speaker 1>We don't necessarily like day to day,</v>

4942
02:12:45.141 --> 02:12:45.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4943
02:12:45.620 --> 02:12:47.300
<v Speaker 1>Some nights they're idiots in certain ways,</v>

4944
02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:50.720
<v Speaker 1>but we forgive him because we know that in talking about yourself now I'm</v>

4945
02:12:50.721 --> 02:12:51.650
<v Speaker 1>talking about taking me out,</v>

4946
02:12:52.260 --> 02:12:55.070
<v Speaker 1>talking to people who feel like he's given us.</v>

4947
02:12:55.071 --> 02:12:57.440
<v Speaker 1>We need a moment of silence which showed that a locked up.</v>

4948
02:12:57.500 --> 02:12:58.760
<v Speaker 1>It might be the last time we see him,</v>

4949
02:12:58.761 --> 02:12:59.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4950
02:12:59.210 --> 02:12:59.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4951
02:12:59.511 --> 02:13:00.080
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4952
02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:00.913
<v Speaker 1>you never know.</v>

4953
02:13:00.980 --> 02:13:03.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean how many more years can that guy go out?</v>

4954
02:13:03.620 --> 02:13:05.990
<v Speaker 1>Mount Rushmore and he's a bad motherfucker.</v>

4955
02:13:06.100 --> 02:13:06.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4956
02:13:06.420 --> 02:13:07.730
<v Speaker 1>About 40 guys on my mouth.</v>

4957
02:13:07.770 --> 02:13:07.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4958
02:13:07.941 --> 02:13:10.400
<v Speaker 1>you must mount Rushmore has to be big as fuck.</v>

4959
02:13:10.400 --> 02:13:11.570
<v Speaker 1>Cause don't give me four or five.</v>

4960
02:13:11.600 --> 02:13:12.141
<v Speaker 1>Well first of all,</v>

4961
02:13:12.141 --> 02:13:12.940
<v Speaker 1>you have to have hoists.</v>

4962
02:13:12.940 --> 02:13:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Gracie Gracie's on Mount Rushmore period.</v>

4963
02:13:15.710 --> 02:13:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4964
02:13:16.490 --> 02:13:19.790
<v Speaker 1>He was the original guy that set it all off whether or not let me still get</v>

4965
02:13:19.791 --> 02:13:20.690
<v Speaker 1>bullied numbers with that.</v>

4966
02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:21.381
<v Speaker 1>Ken shamrock.</v>

4967
02:13:21.381 --> 02:13:22.214
<v Speaker 1>Crazy,</v>

4968
02:13:22.270 --> 02:13:22.940
<v Speaker 1>crazy numbers.</v>

4969
02:13:22.940 --> 02:13:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Huge numbers.</v>

4970
02:13:23.460 --> 02:13:24.800
<v Speaker 1>Millions plus.</v>

4971
02:13:25.490 --> 02:13:26.323
<v Speaker 1>He's got to be on it.</v>

4972
02:13:26.360 --> 02:13:30.260
<v Speaker 1>But that's kind of like the way babe Ruth would be on Mount Rushmore for cause</v>

4973
02:13:30.261 --> 02:13:31.160
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the first.</v>

4974
02:13:31.470 --> 02:13:32.260
<v Speaker 1>So yes.</v>

4975
02:13:32.260 --> 02:13:35.080

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4977
02:13:35.461 --> 02:13:38.070

4978
02:13:38.270 --> 02:13:40.380
<v Speaker 1>they just didn't start it like they did fucking work.</v>

4979
02:13:40.780 --> 02:13:41.220
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4980
02:13:41.220 --> 02:13:43.090
<v Speaker 1>Like Babe Ruth's numbers are legitimate.</v>

4981
02:13:43.110 --> 02:13:44.340
<v Speaker 1>She always,</v>

4982
02:13:44.380 --> 02:13:46.140
<v Speaker 1>Gracie did something spectacular.</v>

4983
02:13:46.141 --> 02:13:49.230
<v Speaker 1>You introduced the idea that a smaller man could be a bigger man in a real life</v>

4984
02:13:49.231 --> 02:13:51.580
<v Speaker 1>fight and with techniques that you've never seen before.</v>

4989
02:13:54.211 --> 02:13:56.070
<v Speaker 1>nobody saw triangles before.</v>

4990
02:13:56.600 --> 02:13:56.940
<v Speaker 1>Hoists.</v>

4991
02:13:56.940 --> 02:13:57.870
<v Speaker 1>Gracie tapped out.</v>

4992
02:13:57.871 --> 02:13:58.471
<v Speaker 1>Dan Severen.</v>

4993
02:13:58.471 --> 02:14:02.310
<v Speaker 1>No one even knew what the fuck he was doing and then when when you try to bring</v>

4994
02:14:02.311 --> 02:14:06.450
<v Speaker 1>it back to go like in 1993 try going to your local Jujitsu school,</v>

4995
02:14:06.750 --> 02:14:07.590
<v Speaker 1>tell him to teach you that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's advanced.</v>

4998
02:14:08.850 --> 02:14:11.310
<v Speaker 1>They were not teaching people triangles because they thought that shit was</v>

4999
02:14:11.311 --> 02:14:12.144
<v Speaker 1>advanced.</v>

5000
02:14:13.170 --> 02:14:14.003
<v Speaker 1>I know a dude,</v>

5001
02:14:14.220 --> 02:14:17.970
<v Speaker 1>I know it it to went through a certain Jujitsu school right afterwards and they</v>

5002
02:14:17.971 --> 02:14:18.804
<v Speaker 1>told him,</v>

5003
02:14:18.870 --> 02:14:20.610
<v Speaker 1>we can't teach you triangles yet.</v>

5004
02:14:20.611 --> 02:14:21.960
<v Speaker 1>You're not ready for that yet.</v>

5005
02:14:21.961 --> 02:14:23.220
<v Speaker 1>That's advanced techniques.</v>

5006
02:14:23.580 --> 02:14:27.390
<v Speaker 1>They were holding shit back from people fade or is on that Mount Rushmore for</v>

5007
02:14:27.391 --> 02:14:27.810
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

5008
02:14:27.810 --> 02:14:30.630
<v Speaker 1>100% faders on there and then current guys,</v>

5009
02:14:30.631 --> 02:14:31.590
<v Speaker 1>I'd say cane.</v>

5010
02:14:32.190 --> 02:14:33.470
<v Speaker 1>How many guys can you have on rush?</v>

5011
02:14:33.471 --> 02:14:34.380
<v Speaker 1>My artist too many.</v>

5012
02:14:34.470 --> 02:14:34.771
<v Speaker 1>There's two.</v>

5013
02:14:34.771 --> 02:14:35.700
<v Speaker 1>Mount Rushmore is,</v>

5014
02:14:35.900 --> 02:14:37.860
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be another thing for,</v>

5015
02:14:38.910 --> 02:14:41.490
<v Speaker 1>you can't have four fours and salvage GSP.</v>

5016
02:14:42.060 --> 02:14:42.870
<v Speaker 1>We know that.</v>

5017
02:14:42.870 --> 02:14:43.380
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5018
02:14:43.380 --> 02:14:46.890
<v Speaker 1>How did they decide who was going to itself and she has to pay 100% how did they</v>

5019
02:14:46.891 --> 02:14:47.724
<v Speaker 1>decide?</v>

5020
02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:49.113
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question.</v>

5021
02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:50.400
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what he,</v>

5022
02:14:50.400 --> 02:14:51.233
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

5023
02:14:52.230 --> 02:14:54.240
<v Speaker 1>Who are the guys that have stayed at the top for a long time.</v>

5024
02:14:54.570 --> 02:14:55.350
<v Speaker 1>Anderson Silva,</v>

5025
02:14:55.350 --> 02:14:57.090
<v Speaker 1>GSP and finished dudes.</v>

5026
02:14:57.120 --> 02:14:57.481
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>

5027
02:14:57.481 --> 02:14:59.000
<v Speaker 1>but then what about Matt Hughes?</v>

5028
02:15:00.550 --> 02:15:02.820
<v Speaker 1>Hughes finished GSP in a title fight.</v>

5029
02:15:03.510 --> 02:15:05.340
<v Speaker 1>How long was it Matt who is on top of a while?</v>

5030
02:15:05.850 --> 02:15:06.630
<v Speaker 1>Quite a while.</v>

5031
02:15:06.630 --> 02:15:07.351
<v Speaker 1>Most women gay.</v>

5032
02:15:07.351 --> 02:15:10.350
<v Speaker 1>So that's another real pioneer that change the game and a lot of ways because he</v>

5033
02:15:10.351 --> 02:15:13.380
<v Speaker 1>introduced the idea that high level wrestling plus submissions,</v>

5034
02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:16.230
<v Speaker 1>like when he hit that far side arm bar on GSP,</v>

5035
02:15:16.231 --> 02:15:19.140
<v Speaker 1>GSP went for a Kimora and he didn't secure the legs.</v>

5036
02:15:19.260 --> 02:15:19.651
<v Speaker 1>And Matt,</v>

5037
02:15:19.651 --> 02:15:22.110
<v Speaker 1>he was spun around that far side arm bar and locked it in.</v>

5038
02:15:22.111 --> 02:15:22.944
<v Speaker 1>It was beautiful.</v>

5039
02:15:23.100 --> 02:15:24.270
<v Speaker 1>And then what about Uriah Faber?</v>

5040
02:15:24.330 --> 02:15:27.920
<v Speaker 1>What he did for the little guy and then Wa favor you've got,</v>

5041
02:15:27.950 --> 02:15:28.570
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

5042
02:15:28.570 --> 02:15:29.071
<v Speaker 1>but hold on.</v>

5043
02:15:29.071 --> 02:15:29.760
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

5044
02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:32.220
<v Speaker 1>The problem with Uriah Faber as he never wanted UFC title,</v>

5045
02:15:32.221 --> 02:15:35.750
<v Speaker 1>and I think if you're talking about a UFC hall fame in his prime grade,</v>

5046
02:15:35.780 --> 02:15:36.720
<v Speaker 1>he wanted a WC.</v>

5047
02:15:36.740 --> 02:15:37.590
<v Speaker 1>How am I Bj Penn?</v>

5048
02:15:37.650 --> 02:15:38.483
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

5049
02:15:38.580 --> 02:15:39.640
<v Speaker 1>Bj Penn's gotta be in there,</v>

5050
02:15:39.670 --> 02:15:40.790
<v Speaker 1>he's got the care before.</v>

5051
02:15:40.860 --> 02:15:42.970
<v Speaker 1>It can't be full of 150 full.</v>

5052
02:15:43.720 --> 02:15:48.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to choose after you got to choose stresses me that can't I get</v>

5053
02:15:48.181 --> 02:15:48.541
<v Speaker 1>stressed.</v>

5054
02:15:48.541 --> 02:15:48.790
<v Speaker 1>Hold on,</v>

5055
02:15:48.790 --> 02:15:49.620
<v Speaker 1>hold on,</v>

5056
02:15:49.620 --> 02:15:49.951
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

5057
02:15:49.951 --> 02:15:50.521
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do it.</v>

5058
02:15:50.521 --> 02:15:50.761
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>

5059
02:15:50.761 --> 02:15:51.660
<v Speaker 1>is there a heavy weight in there?</v>

5060
02:15:51.661 --> 02:15:52.590
<v Speaker 1>What heavyweight to choose?</v>

5061
02:15:52.591 --> 02:15:55.770
<v Speaker 1>It'd be probably fade or Taylor or retainer and there's argument for for doom.</v>

5062
02:15:55.980 --> 02:15:56.311
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5063
02:15:56.311 --> 02:15:56.641
<v Speaker 1>not for,</v>

5064
02:15:56.641 --> 02:15:57.474
<v Speaker 1>not for dinner.</v>

5065
02:15:57.750 --> 02:15:58.860
<v Speaker 1>How dare you know?</v>

5066
02:15:58.861 --> 02:15:59.730
<v Speaker 1>Care might be up there,</v>

5067
02:15:59.731 --> 02:16:01.410
<v Speaker 1>but I don't care.</v>

5068
02:16:01.430 --> 02:16:02.263
<v Speaker 1>It might be up there.</v>

5069
02:16:03.180 --> 02:16:05.970
<v Speaker 1>I think federal right over dominance for a long period of time.</v>

5070
02:16:05.971 --> 02:16:07.980
<v Speaker 1>What about Dominick Cruz knocking dude out.</v>

5071
02:16:08.010 --> 02:16:08.720
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

5072
02:16:08.720 --> 02:16:09.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5073
02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:10.050
<v Speaker 1>He only lost twice.</v>

5074
02:16:10.080 --> 02:16:11.970
<v Speaker 1>Once by choke and once by decision.</v>

5075
02:16:12.360 --> 02:16:17.130
<v Speaker 1>You know the last place chosen long ass time ago at one 45 John Jones.</v>

5076
02:16:17.131 --> 02:16:17.671
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

5077
02:16:17.671 --> 02:16:19.080
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't ever lost,</v>

5078
02:16:19.110 --> 02:16:20.700
<v Speaker 1>he came up with John's never lost.</v>

5079
02:16:21.100 --> 02:16:23.550
<v Speaker 1>I think you've going to dude's ass and got this call.</v>

5080
02:16:25.500 --> 02:16:26.460
<v Speaker 1>Anderson Silva.</v>

5081
02:16:27.870 --> 02:16:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Conor McGregor.</v>

5082
02:16:29.860 --> 02:16:30.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5083
02:16:30.220 --> 02:16:30.670
<v Speaker 3>you do.</v>

5084
02:16:30.670 --> 02:16:31.830
<v Speaker 3>You don't like talking about pine,</v>

5085
02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:32.690
<v Speaker 3>like game changers.</v>

5086
02:16:33.510 --> 02:16:34.600
<v Speaker 3>You have to look at a couple of things.</v>

5087
02:16:34.730 --> 02:16:35.563
<v Speaker 3>Longevity,</v>

5088
02:16:35.650 --> 02:16:36.760
<v Speaker 3>like how long were they on top?</v>

5089
02:16:36.790 --> 02:16:37.601
<v Speaker 3>That's got to take a place.</v>

5090
02:16:37.601 --> 02:16:37.900
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5091
02:16:37.900 --> 02:16:39.220
<v Speaker 3>Let's talk about criteria for it.</v>

5092
02:16:39.490 --> 02:16:40.600
<v Speaker 3>How long have you been on top?</v>

5093
02:16:41.480 --> 02:16:41.670
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

5094
02:16:41.670 --> 02:16:42.460
<v Speaker 3>how did you,</v>

5095
02:16:42.460 --> 02:16:43.710
<v Speaker 3>did you finish dudes?</v>

5096
02:16:43.740 --> 02:16:45.190
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of how many finishes that,</v>

5097
02:16:45.191 --> 02:16:46.390
<v Speaker 3>that's got to play a factor.</v>

5098
02:16:46.420 --> 02:16:46.940
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>

5099
02:16:46.940 --> 02:16:48.310
<v Speaker 3>So how long you been in the top?</v>

5100
02:16:48.311 --> 02:16:48.960
<v Speaker 3>So how,</v>

5101
02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:49.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5102
02:16:49.390 --> 02:16:50.171
<v Speaker 3>how long were you champ?</v>

5103
02:16:50.171 --> 02:16:52.000
<v Speaker 3>How long did you hold the belt?</v>

5104
02:16:52.580 --> 02:16:52.810
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

5105
02:16:52.810 --> 02:16:53.920
<v Speaker 3>that's got to play a factor.</v>

5106
02:16:53.970 --> 02:16:54.111
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5107
02:16:54.111 --> 02:16:54.620
<v Speaker 3>that's a big fat.</v>

5108
02:16:54.620 --> 02:16:55.120
<v Speaker 3>How long,</v>

5109
02:16:55.120 --> 02:16:56.170
<v Speaker 3>how did you do it?</v>

5110
02:16:56.171 --> 02:16:57.010
<v Speaker 3>Did you finish?</v>

5111
02:16:57.040 --> 02:17:00.460
<v Speaker 3>How many people did you actually finish your competition too?</v>

5112
02:17:00.790 --> 02:17:03.730
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes guys get dominant and they're in a slump in the division.</v>

5113
02:17:03.731 --> 02:17:06.550
<v Speaker 3>Like when Mike Tyson came along and was Merck and everybody,</v>

5114
02:17:06.551 --> 02:17:06.851
<v Speaker 3>and there was,</v>

02:17:06.851 --> 02:17:07.870
<v Speaker 3>you know Tony tubs?</v>

02:17:07.900 --> 02:17:07.991
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5117
02:17:07.991 --> 02:17:08.321
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

5118
02:17:08.321 --> 02:17:13.321
<v Speaker 3>he's fighting Bruce Selden on my mount Rushmore for that reason.</v>

5119
02:17:13.451 --> 02:17:18.160
<v Speaker 3>He's on my mount Rushmore to GSP fought everybody and stayed on top forever.</v>

5120
02:17:18.720 --> 02:17:21.040
<v Speaker 3>Everybody Hoists Bj,</v>

5121
02:17:21.310 --> 02:17:22.210
<v Speaker 3>Jon Jones.</v>

5122
02:17:22.270 --> 02:17:23.110
<v Speaker 3>Anderson Silva,</v>

5123
02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:24.153
<v Speaker 3>GSP.</v>

5124
02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:24.993
<v Speaker 3>What about</v>

5127
02:17:30.010 --> 02:17:30.520
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5128
02:17:30.520 --> 02:17:34.170
<v Speaker 3>see Jon Jones has never lost though and he's beating all those other guys.</v>

5129
02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:36.670
<v Speaker 3>It was the youngest champ.</v>

5130
02:17:36.700 --> 02:17:38.500
<v Speaker 3>How long was he up on top for two years.</v>

5131
02:17:38.890 --> 02:17:39.541
<v Speaker 3>No long though.</v>

5132
02:17:39.541 --> 02:17:40.510
<v Speaker 3>It's been on longer than that.</v>

5133
02:17:40.511 --> 02:17:41.700

5135
02:17:45.890 --> 02:17:46.790
<v Speaker 3>so it's never lost weight.</v>

5136
02:17:47.860 --> 02:17:48.760
<v Speaker 3>He's 30 now.</v>

5137
02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:50.320
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.</v>

5138
02:17:50.321 --> 02:17:51.011
<v Speaker 3>Seven years.</v>

5139
02:17:51.011 --> 02:17:52.120
<v Speaker 3>B.</v>

5140
02:17:52.120 --> 02:17:53.230
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't on top of seven years.</v>

5141
02:17:53.290 --> 02:17:53.831
<v Speaker 3>Oh wait a minute.</v>

5142
02:17:53.831 --> 02:17:54.380

02:18:35.260 --> 02:18:38.290
<v Speaker 3>He changed a lot of shit to UFC.</v>

02:18:56.470 --> 02:18:59.380
<v Speaker 3>You could argue that he might've won that decision against Bisping.</v>

5184
02:18:59.380 --> 02:19:00.670
<v Speaker 3>He was anywhere other than England.</v>

5185
02:19:00.840 --> 02:19:01.960
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people have argued that.</v>

5186
02:19:02.140 --> 02:19:02.740
<v Speaker 3>I understand,</v>

5187
02:19:02.740 --> 02:19:04.690
<v Speaker 3>but I'm talking about people that held the belt.</v>

<v Speaker 3>if he beats Bisbing and wins the middleweight title,</v>

5193

02:23:37.111 --> 02:23:37.800
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

02:23:37.800 --> 02:23:39.060
<v Speaker 1>He was a great kickboxer man.</v>

5348
02:23:39.061 --> 02:23:39.601
<v Speaker 1>Phil nurses,</v>

5349
02:23:39.601 --> 02:23:42.050
<v Speaker 1>a bad motherfucker and great coach too.</v>

5350
02:23:42.110 --> 02:23:42.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5351
02:23:42.570 --> 02:23:43.560
<v Speaker 1>he's better at money.</v>

5352
02:23:44.610 --> 02:23:46.680
<v Speaker 1>It's so expensive for rent there.</v>

5353
02:23:47.100 --> 02:23:47.341
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5354
02:23:47.341 --> 02:23:47.760
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>

5355
02:23:47.760 --> 02:23:49.020
<v Speaker 1>what is rent in New York City?</v>

5356
02:23:49.020 --> 02:23:49.621
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

5357
02:23:49.621 --> 02:23:50.730
<v Speaker 1>Especially where he's at.</v>

5358
02:23:51.080 --> 02:23:52.310
<v Speaker 1>Did you'd have talked to people that have like a,</v>

5359
02:23:52.311 --> 02:23:55.050
<v Speaker 1>a tiny ass little apartment and you talk to them.</v>

5360
02:23:55.051 --> 02:23:55.231
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

5361
02:23:55.231 --> 02:23:56.100
<v Speaker 1>how much do you pay a month?</v>

5362
02:23:56.101 --> 02:23:58.590
<v Speaker 1>$4,000 for a studio.</v>

5363
02:23:58.710 --> 02:24:03.710
<v Speaker 1>So that means you have to make $50,000 a year just to pay for this apartment.</v>

5364
02:24:04.440 --> 02:24:04.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5365
02:24:04.890 --> 02:24:05.790
<v Speaker 1>that's insane.</v>

5366
02:24:05.791 --> 02:24:06.624
<v Speaker 1>Hundred Square feet.</v>

5367
02:24:06.780 --> 02:24:08.340
<v Speaker 1>So if you make a hundred grand a year,</v>

5368
02:24:08.460 --> 02:24:10.620
<v Speaker 1>half of it is going to your studio apartment.</v>

5369
02:24:11.070 --> 02:24:12.120
<v Speaker 1>Biggest problem is so much,</v>

5370
02:24:12.150 --> 02:24:15.330
<v Speaker 1>so much Chinese and Russian and foreign money moved into New York and started</v>

5371
02:24:15.331 --> 02:24:16.164
<v Speaker 1>buying problems.</v>

5372
02:24:16.740 --> 02:24:17.573
<v Speaker 1>And so when they sit,</v>

5373
02:24:17.640 --> 02:24:20.070
<v Speaker 1>they sit empty because it's a safe place to put your money.</v>

5374
02:24:20.420 --> 02:24:23.850
<v Speaker 1>So they built these towers where you people are buying literally spending three</v>

5375
02:24:23.851 --> 02:24:28.851
<v Speaker 1>grand a square foot for apartments that are sitting there empty and they rent</v>

5376
02:24:29.191 --> 02:24:29.670
<v Speaker 1>them out.</v>

5377
02:24:29.670 --> 02:24:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5378
02:24:30.460 --> 02:24:31.730
<v Speaker 1>it's a place based solutions,</v>

5379
02:24:31.740 --> 02:24:33.510
<v Speaker 1>a fairly rich to keep their money.</v>

5380
02:24:33.690 --> 02:24:34.321
<v Speaker 1>I get it,</v>

5381
02:24:34.321 --> 02:24:35.154
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to be safe.</v>

5382
02:24:35.550 --> 02:24:37.440
<v Speaker 1>Can you say that Brennan Shop,</v>

5383
02:24:37.441 --> 02:24:38.910
<v Speaker 1>but in 10 years when you're</v>

5384
02:24:40.490 --> 02:24:44.730
<v Speaker 1>Paul and out of control and you decide to buy some penthouse house up there and</v>

5385
02:24:44.731 --> 02:24:45.600
<v Speaker 1>just keep it be,</v>

5386
02:24:45.810 --> 02:24:46.820
<v Speaker 1>it's just for this,</v>

5387
02:24:46.830 --> 02:24:48.060
<v Speaker 1>for some sort of an investment.</v>

5388
02:24:48.061 --> 02:24:48.421
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

5389
02:24:48.421 --> 02:24:48.811
<v Speaker 1>You're right,</v>

5390

<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it,</v>

5493
02:27:22.750 --> 02:27:24.970
<v Speaker 1>sometimes he clipped him on the temple and dropped them.</v>

02:27:28.361 --> 02:27:29.440

<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

5499

<v Speaker 1>I'm Liotta with Wimber.</v>

5500
02:27:31.930 --> 02:27:32.341
<v Speaker 1>He caught it.</v>

5501
02:27:32.341 --> 02:27:33.174
<v Speaker 1>It was at the top.</v>

5502
02:27:33.310 --> 02:27:34.143
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>

5503
02:27:35.200 --> 02:27:36.400
<v Speaker 1>He tagged him with that right hand.</v>

5504
02:27:37.300 --> 02:27:37.721
<v Speaker 1>Really aren't.</v>

5505
02:27:37.721 --> 02:27:38.380
<v Speaker 1>They looked a little,</v>

5506
02:27:38.380 --> 02:27:38.880
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5507
02:27:38.880 --> 02:27:40.960
<v Speaker 1>I think they've been paying it so he should be a little fatigue.</v>

5508
02:27:41.170 --> 02:27:42.370
<v Speaker 1>They're both a little fatigued.</v>

5509
02:27:43.210 --> 02:27:44.620
<v Speaker 1>Do not quit though,</v>

5510
02:27:44.710 --> 02:27:45.730
<v Speaker 1>and just fucking off.</v>

5511
02:27:45.880 --> 02:27:46.713
<v Speaker 1>It looks bigger.</v>

5512
02:27:48.310 --> 02:27:49.210
<v Speaker 1>It looks way bigger.</v>

5513
02:27:49.600 --> 02:27:50.433
<v Speaker 1>He's a big boy.</v>

5514
02:27:50.620 --> 02:27:52.180
<v Speaker 1>He's been doing really well with that Jab.</v>

5515
02:27:52.181 --> 02:27:54.730
<v Speaker 1>But look at that counter of that right hand over the top right there.</v>

5516
02:27:54.731 --> 02:27:55.564
<v Speaker 1>That was clean.</v>

5517
02:27:55.810 --> 02:27:57.960
<v Speaker 1>And then Sjogren's patient on in too.</v>

5518
02:27:57.970 --> 02:27:58.721
<v Speaker 1>When he puts it together,</v>

5519
02:27:58.721 --> 02:27:59.770
<v Speaker 1>he was just all in one shot there.</v>

5520
02:27:59.771 --> 02:28:00.820
<v Speaker 1>Now when he puts two together,</v>

5521
02:28:00.821 --> 02:28:02.320
<v Speaker 1>they'd lay in two to three land forum.</v>

5522
02:28:02.380 --> 02:28:04.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm shocked at how much these guys have abandoned their cakes.</v>

02:29:04.131 --> 02:29:04.400
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5574
02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:05.211

5575
02:29:05.211 --> 02:29:05.451
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5576
02:29:05.451 --> 02:29:08.340
<v Speaker 1>she always in that shogun spreading in this field.</v>

5577
02:29:08.730 --> 02:29:10.730
<v Speaker 1>Opening it for the shoe box.</v>

5578
02:29:10.731 --> 02:29:11.930
<v Speaker 1>Old School Combo.</v>

5579
02:29:11.960 --> 02:29:12.621
<v Speaker 1>Shut the box.</v>

5580
02:29:12.621 --> 02:29:13.454
<v Speaker 1>Shut the box.</v>

5581
02:29:14.530 --> 02:29:14.960
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

5582
02:29:14.960 --> 02:29:16.190
<v Speaker 1>when you watch shogun fight,</v>

5583
02:29:16.220 --> 02:29:17.000
<v Speaker 1>you just want to go.</v>

5584
02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:20.810
<v Speaker 1>Just think of how many wars this guy's been in the gym.</v>

5585
02:29:21.020 --> 02:29:24.500
<v Speaker 1>They get how many wars this guy's been in the ring and then in the cage it's</v>

5586
02:29:24.501 --> 02:29:25.151
<v Speaker 1>still doing the day.</v>

5587
02:29:25.151 --> 02:29:29.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm still doing it and he just wants to pluck as utero stuff saying,</v>

5588
02:29:29.271 --> 02:29:29.841
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

5589
02:29:29.841 --> 02:29:31.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm [inaudible] to my left.</v>

5590
02:29:31.820 --> 02:29:34.940
<v Speaker 1>As I respect the absolute warrior,</v>

5591
02:29:34.970 --> 02:29:38.060
<v Speaker 1>like that's how I would describe him.</v>

5592
02:29:38.420 --> 02:29:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Like he's just doing the damn thing.</v>

5593
02:29:41.150 --> 02:29:43.530
<v Speaker 1>Loves to fight again with that overhand right.</v>

5594
02:29:43.531 --> 02:29:43.880
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

5595
02:29:43.880 --> 02:29:45.440
<v Speaker 1>he keeps timing that well,</v>

5596
02:29:46.970 --> 02:29:48.440
<v Speaker 1>he's starting to find openings to,</v>

5597
02:29:48.441 --> 02:29:50.580
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of that is also going to the body enough.</v>

5598
02:29:50.790 --> 02:29:51.990
<v Speaker 1>The more it's going to body.</v>

5599
02:29:51.991 --> 02:29:52.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5600
02:29:52.261 --> 02:29:52.851
<v Speaker 1>A little baby.</v>

5601
02:29:52.851 --> 02:29:54.380
<v Speaker 1>One little head movement.</v>

5602
02:29:54.430 --> 02:29:55.070
<v Speaker 1>A little movement,</v>

5603
02:29:55.070 --> 02:29:55.251
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5604
02:29:55.251 --> 02:29:59.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm not mad at Shogun sweep that folks can leg looks really good.</v>

5605
02:29:59.271 --> 02:30:00.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's taking some shots but,</v>

5606
02:30:00.770 --> 02:30:01.430
<v Speaker 1>and philosophies,</v>

5607
02:30:01.430 --> 02:30:02.151
<v Speaker 1>no choke man.</v>

5608
02:30:02.151 --> 02:30:02.661
<v Speaker 1>Not at all,</v>

5609
02:30:02.661 --> 02:30:02.990
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5610
02:30:02.990 --> 02:30:04.180
<v Speaker 1>So he keeps calling the custody.</v>

5611
02:30:04.190 --> 02:30:05.920
<v Speaker 1>I like how he's going to the body and mix it up.</v>

5612
02:30:05.960 --> 02:30:06.741
<v Speaker 1>You guys ever read that book?</v>

02:30:14.870 --> 02:30:16.100
<v Speaker 1>He had to get like surgery.</v>

02:30:24.350 --> 02:30:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Female.</v>

5628
02:30:24.650 --> 02:30:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Billy Anthony's.</v>

5631
02:30:28.071 --> 02:30:31.240
<v Speaker 1>So there has to be some sort of brain damage you'd think game.</v>

5632
02:30:31.290 --> 02:30:33.110
<v Speaker 7>Hmm.</v>

5638
02:30:38.451 --> 02:30:40.160

<v Speaker 1>no one's more durable than 15 years.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's not really that laugh.</v>

5648
02:30:57.050 --> 02:31:00.050
<v Speaker 1>The last one I seen him go flatline like that.</v>

5649
02:31:00.230 --> 02:31:01.670
<v Speaker 1>Only in the Melvin Manhoef fight.</v>

02:31:01.671 --> 02:31:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Remember Melvin column?</v>

5651
02:31:02.650 --> 02:31:03.483
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

5652
02:31:04.670 --> 02:31:05.151
<v Speaker 1>fought him.</v>

5653
02:31:05.151 --> 02:31:06.950
<v Speaker 1>He says he is.</v>

5654
02:31:07.070 --> 02:31:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5655
02:31:07.290 --> 02:31:08.030
<v Speaker 1>Smaller than him.</v>

5656
02:31:08.030 --> 02:31:08.331
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>

5657
02:31:08.331 --> 02:31:10.760
<v Speaker 1>Smaller Melvin was one 80 oh my God.</v>

5658
02:31:10.770 --> 02:31:13.250
<v Speaker 1>Your mom close to 60 oh my God.</v>

5660
02:31:19.051 --> 02:31:19.920
<v Speaker 1>key one or pride.</v>

5661
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:20.850
<v Speaker 1>Was it pride?</v>

5662
02:31:20.850 --> 02:31:25.050
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it was k one it was definitely an MMA fight.</v>

5663
02:31:25.050 --> 02:31:26.220
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a kickboxing fight,</v>

5664
02:31:26.221 --> 02:31:27.270
<v Speaker 1>but it might've been pride,</v>

5665
02:31:27.750 --> 02:31:29.430
<v Speaker 1>but either way he see if you could find that.</v>

5666
02:31:29.431 --> 02:31:29.701
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy,</v>

5667
02:31:29.701 --> 02:31:30.150

5668
02:31:30.150 --> 02:31:31.910
<v Speaker 1>oh my pride.</v>

5669
02:31:32.130 --> 02:31:32.963
<v Speaker 1>That's pride bro.</v>

5670
02:31:33.060 --> 02:31:33.271
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5671
02:31:33.271 --> 02:31:34.140
<v Speaker 1>it's k one dynamite.</v>

5672
02:31:34.170 --> 02:31:34.471
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5673
02:31:34.471 --> 02:31:35.400
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is.</v>

5674
02:31:35.970 --> 02:31:36.601
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

5675
02:31:36.601 --> 02:31:37.590
<v Speaker 1>watch this Brian.</v>

5676
02:31:37.591 --> 02:31:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Cause this is crazy because Melvin is,</v>

5677
02:31:40.200 --> 02:31:41.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean at the most,</v>

5678
02:31:42.660 --> 02:31:43.201
<v Speaker 1>at the most,</v>

5679
02:31:43.201 --> 02:31:44.011
<v Speaker 1>he's 200 pounds,</v>

5680
02:31:44.011 --> 02:31:45.710
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it not to Honda.</v>

5681
02:31:45.720 --> 02:31:49.260
<v Speaker 1>I think he's one 95 yeah.</v>

5682
02:31:49.261 --> 02:31:51.660
<v Speaker 1>Well he fought Robbie Lawler 85 and strike force,</v>

5683
02:31:51.661 --> 02:31:54.300
<v Speaker 1>which means he's probably a little heavier than that and losing weight to get to</v>

5684
02:31:54.301 --> 02:31:56.870
<v Speaker 1>85 so let's say he's 95 what's this sound?</v>

5685
02:31:56.910 --> 02:31:57.840
<v Speaker 1>The benefit of the doubt.</v>

5686
02:31:58.470 --> 02:32:01.380
<v Speaker 1>So mark is at least 60 pounds heavier than him.</v>

5687
02:32:01.410 --> 02:32:04.940
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that Japanese shit folk.</v>

5688
02:32:04.941 --> 02:32:06.180
<v Speaker 1>And it happens in the first round.</v>

5689
02:32:06.181 --> 02:32:07.710
<v Speaker 1>He's got two seconds in.</v>

5690
02:32:08.150 --> 02:32:08.370
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5691
02:32:08.370 --> 02:32:09.390
<v Speaker 1>those are pride gloves.</v>

5692
02:32:09.570 --> 02:32:11.070
<v Speaker 1>It was the same as the k one gloves.</v>

5693
02:32:11.400 --> 02:32:11.941
<v Speaker 1>They were a,</v>

5694
02:32:11.941 --> 02:32:12.960
<v Speaker 1>they were just different.</v>

5695
02:32:12.990 --> 02:32:15.120
<v Speaker 1>They look like they were more padded than they were.</v>

5696
02:32:15.290 --> 02:32:15.991
<v Speaker 1>I count fast,</v>

5697
02:32:15.991 --> 02:32:16.201
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5698
02:32:16.201 --> 02:32:16.491
<v Speaker 1>Hope it's,</v>

5699
02:32:16.491 --> 02:32:17.160
<v Speaker 1>look at this.</v>

5700
02:32:17.160 --> 02:32:17.401

5706
02:32:21.751 --> 02:32:24.860
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's worse because it's flatlined.</v>

5707
02:32:24.930 --> 02:32:26.340
<v Speaker 1>It was for a short guy.</v>

5708
02:32:26.341 --> 02:32:27.660
<v Speaker 1>Never fought in the UFC.</v>

5709
02:32:28.830 --> 02:32:29.640
<v Speaker 1>Melvin never caught.</v>

02:32:29.640 --> 02:32:30.740

<v Speaker 1>nice place for older MMA fighters to go to.</v>

5736
02:33:22.020 --> 02:33:22.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5737
02:33:22.470 --> 02:33:26.940
<v Speaker 1>it would be nice if there was a place like pride was in its glory days and if</v>

5738
02:33:26.941 --> 02:33:27.774
<v Speaker 1>it's rising,</v>

5741
02:33:30.360 --> 02:33:32.160
<v Speaker 1>he caught him coming and clipped him right in the jaw.</v>

5742

<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

5743
02:33:32.461 --> 02:33:33.990
<v Speaker 1>I put the brakes on to the body,</v>

5744
02:33:34.200 --> 02:33:36.480
<v Speaker 1>to the body and cardio.</v>

5745
02:33:36.481 --> 02:33:36.941
<v Speaker 1>How does it build it?</v>

5746
02:33:36.941 --> 02:33:39.020
<v Speaker 1>And it's just part on like that boom,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's smelling blood in the water.</v>

5748
02:33:40.170 --> 02:33:41.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh boom.</v>

5751
02:33:43.350 --> 02:33:47.970
<v Speaker 1>That is a fucking phenomenal combination around tires.</v>

5752
02:33:49.080 --> 02:33:49.913
<v Speaker 1>But look how he doesn't,</v>

5753
02:33:51.750 --> 02:33:53.490
<v Speaker 1>he just clipped him with that right hand.</v>

02:33:53.810 --> 02:33:54.643
<v Speaker 1>That true.</v>

5802
02:35:04.061 --> 02:35:05.200
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons I live here.</v>

5863
02:36:38.540 --> 02:36:40.030
<v Speaker 1>like in the room when they walked in,</v>

5864
02:36:40.031 --> 02:36:40.864
<v Speaker 1>the producers went,</v>

<v Speaker 1>so what's your pitch?</v>

5871
02:36:55.641 --> 02:37:00.100
<v Speaker 1>So He created something that was so entirely different than any other alien</v>

5872
02:37:00.101 --> 02:37:00.731
<v Speaker 1>landscape.</v>

5875
02:37:05.230 --> 02:37:09.460
<v Speaker 1>And also that alien itself was so much different than any other idea.</v>

5876
02:37:09.461 --> 02:37:12.100
<v Speaker 1>We had always had this idea of like the super intelligent things from other</v>

<v Speaker 1>but if [inaudible] can swarm him in the first round,</v>

6006
02:40:19.110 --> 02:40:23.010
<v Speaker 1>he's been known to be able to put anybody on Queer Street one round to get it</v>

6007
02:40:23.011 --> 02:40:23.250
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

6008
02:40:23.250 --> 02:40:24.150
<v Speaker 1>But I'm telling you,</v>

6009
02:40:24.151 --> 02:40:27.930
<v Speaker 1>Kelvin Gaslamp takes a punch about as good as any fucking human being alive.</v>

6010
02:40:28.590 --> 02:40:28.980
<v Speaker 1>His,</v>

6011
02:40:28.980 --> 02:40:29.890
<v Speaker 1>his jaws.</v>

6012
02:40:29.910 --> 02:40:30.743
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

6013
02:40:31.080 --> 02:40:32.460
<v Speaker 1>He never see Calvin get hurt.</v>

6014
02:40:32.670 --> 02:40:33.001
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6015
02:40:33.001 --> 02:40:33.990
<v Speaker 1>he's a tank,</v>

6016
02:40:34.590 --> 02:40:37.770
<v Speaker 1>he's an excellent wrestler and he knows how to win man.</v>

6017
02:40:37.790 --> 02:40:41.580
<v Speaker 1>He know how he went to win on the ultimate fighter when nobody sort of thought</v>

6018
02:40:41.581 --> 02:40:42.810
<v Speaker 1>that he was going to be winning that show.</v>

6019
02:40:42.960 --> 02:40:44.340
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's looking to Uriah Hall.</v>

6020
02:40:44.700 --> 02:40:45.780
<v Speaker 1>He tuned up.</v>

6021
02:40:45.781 --> 02:40:46.800
<v Speaker 1>Can't Tim Kennedy,</v>

6022
02:40:46.801 --> 02:40:48.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean he tuned him up,</v>

6023
02:40:48.391 --> 02:40:49.224
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

6024
02:40:49.650 --> 02:40:50.483
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

6025
02:40:50.990 --> 02:40:51.260
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

6026
02:40:51.260 --> 02:40:54.060
<v Speaker 1>he's saying file insane fight.</v>

6027
02:40:54.750 --> 02:40:56.730
<v Speaker 1>Tim is making it safe for democracy so,</v>

6028
02:40:57.060 --> 02:40:57.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

6029
02:40:57.450 --> 02:40:58.081
<v Speaker 1>you know what it is?</v>

6030
02:40:58.081 --> 02:41:03.081
<v Speaker 1>Tim trained for two different fights and went through two camps and a,</v>

6031
02:41:04.561 --> 02:41:08.340
<v Speaker 1>I think he was really overtrained and he looked like he wasn't recovering well</v>

6032
02:41:08.341 --> 02:41:09.174
<v Speaker 1>in that fight.</v>

6033
02:41:09.180 --> 02:41:10.950
<v Speaker 1>That's what has a lot of other options,</v>

6034
02:41:10.980 --> 02:41:11.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6035
02:41:11.251 --> 02:41:12.150
<v Speaker 1>and he's kind of half in,</v>

6036
02:41:12.151 --> 02:41:14.220
<v Speaker 1>half out maybe.</v>

6037
02:41:14.250 --> 02:41:15.540
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think that's what did it,</v>

6038
02:41:15.541 --> 02:41:15.781
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

6039
02:41:15.781 --> 02:41:16.320
<v Speaker 1>I think we did.</v>

6040
02:41:16.320 --> 02:41:18.720
<v Speaker 1>A man is his cardio and he's known for his cardio.</v>

6041
02:41:18.721 --> 02:41:19.650
<v Speaker 1>So I think what happened,</v>

6042
02:41:19.690 --> 02:41:20.510
<v Speaker 1>he cut,</v>

6043
02:41:20.510 --> 02:41:23.540
<v Speaker 1>not even think it's the weight cut as much as it's overtraining and all us,</v>

6044
02:41:23.850 --> 02:41:25.710
<v Speaker 1>his training partners think that it's overtraining,</v>

6045
02:41:26.130 --> 02:41:27.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's also Calvin gas alum.</v>

6046
02:41:27.870 --> 02:41:31.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean Calvin might've got him even if he had everything going for him because</v>

6047
02:41:31.380 --> 02:41:33.210
<v Speaker 1>Tim is like a thick,</v>

6048
02:41:33.270 --> 02:41:34.200
<v Speaker 1>solid,</v>

6049
02:41:34.270 --> 02:41:36.360
<v Speaker 1>super strong grappler,</v>

6050
02:41:36.420 --> 02:41:38.430
<v Speaker 1>but kind of plotting on the feet,</v>

6051
02:41:38.730 --> 02:41:39.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6052
02:41:39.061 --> 02:41:42.180
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't throw anything with lightning fast precision.</v>

6053
02:41:42.390 --> 02:41:43.500
<v Speaker 1>But Calvin,</v>

6054
02:41:43.770 --> 02:41:46.650
<v Speaker 1>the punches come like lightening man and they,</v>

6055
02:41:46.830 --> 02:41:47.310
<v Speaker 1>and he does,</v>

6056
02:41:47.310 --> 02:41:49.020
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't load up on his punches.</v>

6057
02:41:49.080 --> 02:41:54.080
<v Speaker 1>He's constantly moving and constantly moving in and out with his foot work.</v>

6058
02:41:54.590 --> 02:41:55.500
<v Speaker 1>But he's getting a lot,</v>

6059
02:41:55.501 --> 02:41:56.850
<v Speaker 1>but he's getting better fast.</v>

6060
02:41:57.130 --> 02:42:00.040
<v Speaker 1>When you see improvements fight after fight I was,</v>

6061
02:42:00.200 --> 02:42:03.810
<v Speaker 1>I was never really on the Kelvin train and then after that one I was like,</v>

6062
02:42:03.811 --> 02:42:04.920
<v Speaker 1>God damn you going to be trouble.</v>

6063
02:42:04.920 --> 02:42:09.130
<v Speaker 1>Especially at 85 I think the top five is going to be a real challenge for him.</v>

6064
02:42:09.131 --> 02:42:13.350
<v Speaker 1>But outside that he's a monster to do when they show the TRT v I was going to</v>

6065
02:42:13.351 --> 02:42:15.120
<v Speaker 1>send him on.</v>

6066
02:42:15.121 --> 02:42:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Trt is literally so night and day.</v>

6067
02:42:18.001 --> 02:42:18.780
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

6068
02:42:18.780 --> 02:42:19.411
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

6069
02:42:19.411 --> 02:42:20.244
<v Speaker 1>So scary.</v>

6070
02:42:20.580 --> 02:42:23.310
<v Speaker 1>But he knocked out Dan Henderson and I fight the last one.</v>

6071
02:42:23.430 --> 02:42:24.660
<v Speaker 1>There was no TRT.</v>

6072
02:42:26.570 --> 02:42:28.000
<v Speaker 1>Chris had been kind of,</v>

6073
02:42:28.050 --> 02:42:28.883
<v Speaker 1>that was about,</v>

6074
02:42:29.310 --> 02:42:29.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

6075
02:42:29.550 --> 02:42:30.420
<v Speaker 1>how about more saucy?</v>

6076
02:42:30.421 --> 02:42:31.960
<v Speaker 1>We saucy beat the fuck out of them.</v>

6077
02:42:31.970 --> 02:42:32.803
<v Speaker 1>Takes off.</v>

6078
02:42:32.890 --> 02:42:34.620
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] went through the first round,</v>

6079
02:42:34.680 --> 02:42:35.610
<v Speaker 1>survived the storm,</v>

6080
02:42:35.611 --> 02:42:36.540
<v Speaker 1>said what he was gonna do.</v>

6081
02:42:36.541 --> 02:42:36.811
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

6082
02:42:36.811 --> 02:42:39.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take him in the first round and I'm going to knock them out.</v>

6083
02:42:40.090 --> 02:42:41.370
<v Speaker 1>And as he took them out of the first round,</v>

6084
02:42:41.440 --> 02:42:42.480
<v Speaker 1>he took him into the second,</v>

6085
02:42:43.180 --> 02:42:45.090
<v Speaker 1>took them into the second and just wore his ass out.</v>

6086
02:42:45.450 --> 02:42:46.680
<v Speaker 1>Vito just can't sustain.</v>

6087
02:42:46.681 --> 02:42:47.514
<v Speaker 1>Look at Victor.</v>

6088
02:42:48.150 --> 02:42:49.260

6089
02:42:49.261 --> 02:42:50.400

6090
02:42:50.430 --> 02:42:50.980

<v Speaker 1>Sophie tournament master.</v>

6092
02:42:52.630 --> 02:42:57.630
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you why I like Kelvin with his confidence and he had zero fear.</v>

6093
02:42:57.930 --> 02:42:58.380
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

6096

6097
02:43:05.890 --> 02:43:06.723
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

6098
02:43:08.720 --> 02:43:10.590
<v Speaker 1>It's no need to discuss this further,</v>

6099
02:43:10.591 --> 02:43:11.140

<v Speaker 2>Especially down the beach area.</v>

6135
02:44:00.431 --> 02:44:01.690
<v Speaker 2>Like Huntington beach in particular.</v>

6136
02:44:01.690 --> 02:44:01.871
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

6143
02:44:09.911 --> 02:44:11.560
<v Speaker 2>It's more of a hotbed for martial arts,</v>

6144
02:44:11.561 --> 02:44:15.140
<v Speaker 2>like on the level that this place is like New York and La are the two,</v>

6146
02:44:17.890 --> 02:44:18.723

<v Speaker 2>such a violent sport can be like sweetheart dicks because they'd been humbled.</v>

6352
02:49:31.951 --> 02:49:34.650
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody who's really gotten in the sport has been knocked out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

6387
02:50:17.011 --> 02:50:18.000
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting when you see him,</v>

6388
02:50:18.001 --> 02:50:20.340
<v Speaker 2>when that full suit and you see all the neck tattoos,</v>

6392
02:50:22.620 --> 02:50:24.480
<v Speaker 2>He's like polishing up a murderer.</v>

6393
02:50:26.320 --> 02:50:27.930
<v Speaker 2>He's when he's inside that octagon.</v>

6394
02:50:27.931 --> 02:50:29.810
<v Speaker 2>Did he use pit bulls?</v>

6395
02:50:29.820 --> 02:50:30.653
<v Speaker 2>Toenails</v>

6396
02:50:32.070 --> 02:50:32.940
<v Speaker 2>fans in Brazil?</v>

6400
02:50:37.080 --> 02:50:37.810
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>

6401
02:50:37.810 --> 02:50:39.990
<v Speaker 2>I'll look at that.</v>

6402
02:50:40.020 --> 02:50:41.370
<v Speaker 2>Calvin looks so calm.</v>

6403
02:50:41.970 --> 02:50:43.530
<v Speaker 2>No one is more calm in there.</v>

6404
02:50:43.570 --> 02:50:44.060
<v Speaker 2>Nobody.</v>

6405
02:50:44.060 --> 02:50:44.893
<v Speaker 2>Calvin.</v>

6406
02:50:45.300 --> 02:50:47.550
<v Speaker 2>Part of the reason is cause he takes such a good shot.</v>

6407
02:50:48.060 --> 02:50:51.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously he's really good and he's just confident period.</v>

6408
02:50:51.031 --> 02:50:55.740
<v Speaker 2>But Calvin's got that Chin is fucking iron that has to help you.</v>

6409
02:50:55.780 --> 02:50:56.613
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

6410
02:50:56.700 --> 02:50:58.860
<v Speaker 2>Cause you know you can make a little mistake and still get away.</v>

6411
02:50:59.310 --> 02:50:59.760
<v Speaker 2>Get Away with.</v>

6412
02:50:59.760 --> 02:51:00.960
<v Speaker 2>That's chuck in his prime.</v>

6413
02:51:00.961 --> 02:51:01.771
<v Speaker 2>And Chuck's prime,</v>

6414
02:51:01.771 --> 02:51:03.660
<v Speaker 2>one of his biggest assets was his chin.</v>

6415
02:51:04.650 --> 02:51:05.640
<v Speaker 2>Chin was phenomenal.</v>

6416
02:51:05.900 --> 02:51:06.510
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

6417
02:51:06.510 --> 02:51:09.150
<v Speaker 2>See now watch how good Calvin moves on his feet.</v>

6418
02:51:09.480 --> 02:51:11.400
<v Speaker 2>He's real light is in and out.</v>

6419
02:51:11.401 --> 02:51:12.780
<v Speaker 2>So count like much distance.</v>

6420
02:51:12.781 --> 02:51:14.520
<v Speaker 2>He covers forward and back.</v>

6421
02:51:14.640 --> 02:51:16.350
<v Speaker 2>Just to let you know he's nowhere near you.</v>

6422
02:51:16.500 --> 02:51:17.380
<v Speaker 2>He's Kinda close.</v>

6423
02:51:17.480 --> 02:51:17.940
<v Speaker 2>Changed.</v>

6424
02:51:17.940 --> 02:51:18.900
<v Speaker 2>He's nowhere near you.</v>

6425
02:51:19.110 --> 02:51:19.231
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

6426
02:51:19.231 --> 02:51:20.041
<v Speaker 2>you could switch it up,</v>

6427
02:51:20.041 --> 02:51:20.874
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

6428
02:51:21.030 --> 02:51:21.863
<v Speaker 2>It's a pain in the ass.</v>

6429
02:51:22.840 --> 02:51:24.540
<v Speaker 2>As Unorthodox as possible.</v>

6430
02:51:24.541 --> 02:51:25.200
<v Speaker 2>He's into that.</v>

6431
02:51:25.200 --> 02:51:27.510
<v Speaker 2>It's important because from the South Pole position,</v>

6432
02:51:27.511 --> 02:51:29.010
<v Speaker 2>he shuts down that high kick.</v>

6433
02:51:29.670 --> 02:51:30.660
<v Speaker 2>It's much harder for me.</v>

6434
02:51:30.661 --> 02:51:30.870

02:54:44.680 --> 02:54:45.513
<v Speaker 2>Who's that?</v>

6588
02:54:45.600 --> 02:54:50.410
<v Speaker 2>Kelvin's his pumps and nasty and he throws that Jab,</v>

02:55:06.170 --> 02:55:07.940
<v Speaker 2>He covers a lot of ground with those labs.</v>

6597
02:55:08.460 --> 02:55:08.891
<v Speaker 2>He comes.</v>

6598
02:55:08.891 --> 02:55:10.760
<v Speaker 2>It's weird cause you didn't have a long reach,</v>

6599
02:55:10.761 --> 02:55:12.400
<v Speaker 2>but he keeps great distances.</v>

6671
02:57:11.670 --> 02:57:14.200
<v Speaker 2>We'd take the worst matchup possible for them,</v>

6672
02:57:14.210 --> 02:57:15.043
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

<v Speaker 1>his punches is fucking phenomenal.</v>

6712
02:58:18.090 --> 02:58:22.590
<v Speaker 1>His ability to survive on the ground against Tim Kennedy in that first round and</v>

6713
02:58:22.591 --> 02:58:23.730
<v Speaker 1>like virtually burned,</v>

6714
02:58:23.731 --> 02:58:25.320

6718
02:58:30.870 --> 02:58:32.030
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he's not really preppy.</v>

6726
02:58:44.041 --> 02:58:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Right now we know difficult,</v>

6727
02:58:45.810 --> 02:58:46.830
<v Speaker 1>but this is the next step,</v>

6728
02:58:47.010 --> 02:58:47.843
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6729
02:58:48.810 --> 02:58:49.171
<v Speaker 1>How's that?</v>

6730
02:58:49.171 --> 02:58:50.010
<v Speaker 1>The next step?</v>

6731
02:58:50.011 --> 02:58:50.640
<v Speaker 1>The next thing?</v>

6732
02:58:50.640 --> 02:58:52.320
<v Speaker 1>I think the next logical step.</v>

6733
02:58:52.320 --> 02:58:55.650
<v Speaker 1>I feel like Calvin is top 10 top 10 yes.</v>

6734
02:58:56.430 --> 02:58:57.001
<v Speaker 1>Candy fight.</v>

6735
02:58:57.001 --> 02:58:58.740
<v Speaker 1>I think he was 10 what was he ranked up to?</v>

6736
02:58:58.741 --> 02:58:59.371
<v Speaker 1>The Kennedy file,</v>

6737
02:58:59.371 --> 02:59:00.390
<v Speaker 1>isn't he like he don't know.</v>

6738
02:59:00.391 --> 02:59:03.780
<v Speaker 1>I think he's nine and he and he might be 10 feet towards nine.</v>

6739
02:59:03.810 --> 02:59:04.471
<v Speaker 1>I don't pay attention.</v>

6740
02:59:04.471 --> 02:59:05.760
<v Speaker 1>So if that's the case,</v>

6741
02:59:05.761 --> 02:59:07.740
<v Speaker 1>I feel like he's in the top six or seven now.</v>

6742
02:59:07.741 --> 02:59:08.640
<v Speaker 1>I think he's moved up.</v>

6743
02:59:08.641 --> 02:59:08.911
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

6744
02:59:08.911 --> 02:59:10.380
<v Speaker 1>This is a phenomenal performance.</v>

6745
02:59:10.381 --> 02:59:11.131
<v Speaker 1>He's two and Oh,</v>

6746
02:59:11.131 --> 02:59:14.460
<v Speaker 1>at middleweight he looked amazing against and on the feet.</v>

6747
02:59:14.461 --> 02:59:17.250
<v Speaker 1>It was all in the feet against one of the best trackers in the game.</v>

6748
02:59:17.370 --> 02:59:18.140
<v Speaker 1>Who did you go?</v>

6749
02:59:18.140 --> 02:59:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Aw,</v>

6750
02:59:18.870 --> 02:59:23.010
<v Speaker 1>when you saw vittores phase 10 Devon's 10 I bumps mail.</v>

6751
02:59:23.011 --> 02:59:26.230
<v Speaker 1>When I see a number 10 right before this fight is Robert.</v>

6752
02:59:26.700 --> 02:59:27.650
<v Speaker 1>That'd be a fun follow.</v>

6753
02:59:27.670 --> 02:59:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

6754
02:59:28.590 --> 02:59:29.260
<v Speaker 1>There's a fucking,</v>

6755
02:59:29.260 --> 02:59:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Barbara Whitaker has a barn burner coming up.</v>

6756
02:59:31.570 --> 02:59:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Chalker Ray.</v>

6757
02:59:32.300 --> 02:59:34.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh Damn.</v>

6758
02:59:34.201 --> 02:59:34.800
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be,</v>

6759
02:59:34.800 --> 02:59:35.910
<v Speaker 1>that's a fucking fight.</v>

6760
02:59:36.030 --> 02:59:40.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you give Calvin to Jocko rate or any of those guys.</v>

6761
02:59:40.380 --> 02:59:42.330
<v Speaker 1>Did you know a result of this fight,</v>

6762
02:59:42.331 --> 02:59:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Eddie?</v>

6763
02:59:43.080 --> 02:59:43.913
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6764
02:59:43.980 --> 02:59:45.300
<v Speaker 1>You knew what rounded and the whole deal.</v>

6765
02:59:45.330 --> 02:59:47.340
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what round it was at the first round.</v>

6766
02:59:48.200 --> 02:59:48.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6767
02:59:48.630 --> 02:59:49.463
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6768
02:59:50.990 --> 02:59:53.070
<v Speaker 1>What about Derek Brunson or Anderson Silva?</v>

6769
02:59:54.070 --> 02:59:55.230
<v Speaker 1>Mm hmm.</v>

6770
02:59:55.260 --> 02:59:55.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6771
02:59:55.561 --> 02:59:56.394
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

6772
02:59:56.430 --> 02:59:56.941
<v Speaker 1>But wait a minute,</v>

6773
02:59:56.941 --> 02:59:58.260
<v Speaker 1>why this is not current?</v>

6774
02:59:58.261 --> 02:59:59.880
<v Speaker 1>It can't be because v towards still it had,</v>

6775
03:00:00.210 --> 03:00:00.361
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

6776
03:00:00.361 --> 03:00:01.580
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to update it tonight.</v>

6777
03:00:01.620 --> 03:00:02.370
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6778
03:00:02.370 --> 03:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6779
03:00:02.880 --> 03:00:03.990
<v Speaker 1>but the fight was yesterday.</v>

6780
03:00:03.991 --> 03:00:05.880
<v Speaker 1>I would've thought that Mike has said probably wait till Monday.</v>

6781
03:00:06.150 --> 03:00:06.541
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

6782
03:00:06.541 --> 03:00:06.990
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

6783
03:00:06.990 --> 03:00:08.130
<v Speaker 1>that's a crazy division.</v>

6784
03:00:08.131 --> 03:00:08.964
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

6785
03:00:09.030 --> 03:00:12.300
<v Speaker 1>And Derek Brunson and Anderson Silva just getting done with their fight.</v>

6786
03:00:12.310 --> 03:00:15.060
<v Speaker 1>Robert Whittaker Brunton makes sense out of that.</v>

6787
03:00:16.350 --> 03:00:18.330
<v Speaker 1>It's not a big name fight though for him.</v>

6788
03:00:18.360 --> 03:00:19.193
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6789
03:00:19.290 --> 03:00:20.730
<v Speaker 1>but you got to him still a Brunton.</v>

6790
03:00:20.760 --> 03:00:22.290
<v Speaker 1>Robert Whitaker has a date.</v>

6791
03:00:22.320 --> 03:00:23.130
<v Speaker 1>Messiah says date.</v>

6792
03:00:23.130 --> 03:00:24.240
<v Speaker 1>Why men's date Souza?</v>

6793
03:00:24.250 --> 03:00:25.083
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's,</v>

6794
03:00:25.470 --> 03:00:26.930
<v Speaker 1>everyone has a date for Rochel.</v>

6795
03:00:27.810 --> 03:00:28.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6796
03:00:28.051 --> 03:00:29.970
<v Speaker 1>And Rockhold has been talking about Bisping.</v>

6797
03:00:29.971 --> 03:00:30.541
<v Speaker 1>He's waiting for,</v>

6798
03:00:30.541 --> 03:00:31.650
<v Speaker 1>Bisping wants to kicked,</v>

6799
03:00:32.210 --> 03:00:33.350
<v Speaker 1>put Bisbee and just be doing,</v>

6800
03:00:33.351 --> 03:00:34.141
<v Speaker 1>even have a date.</v>

6801
03:00:34.141 --> 03:00:34.860
<v Speaker 1>So what are you going to do?</v>

6802
03:00:34.860 --> 03:00:36.540
<v Speaker 1>Rockhold where are they going to do that fight?</v>

6803
03:00:36.780 --> 03:00:37.291
<v Speaker 1>They don't know.</v>

6804
03:00:37.291 --> 03:00:37.730
<v Speaker 1>Do they?</v>

6805
03:00:37.730 --> 03:00:38.180
<v Speaker 1>They have,</v>

6806
03:00:38.180 --> 03:00:38.690
<v Speaker 1>even now,</v>

6807
03:00:38.690 --> 03:00:39.460
<v Speaker 1>they may even,</v>

6808
03:00:39.460 --> 03:00:43.860
<v Speaker 1>is this the first time never announced a fight without a date or a venue or I</v>

6809
03:00:43.861 --> 03:00:45.420
<v Speaker 1>feel like it's gotta be the 4th of July weekend,</v>

6810
03:00:45.421 --> 03:00:46.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6811
03:00:46.050 --> 03:00:46.883
<v Speaker 1>You would think,</v>

6812
03:00:47.240 --> 03:00:47.490
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

6813
03:00:47.490 --> 03:00:49.020
<v Speaker 1>If you want to knock something out of the park,</v>

6814
03:00:49.260 --> 03:00:50.011
<v Speaker 1>what does it say there?</v>

6815
03:00:50.011 --> 03:00:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Bisbing versus Saint Pierre.</v>

6816
03:00:51.091 --> 03:00:51.960
<v Speaker 1>Does it say a number?</v>

6817
03:00:52.380 --> 03:00:55.620
<v Speaker 1>You'd go look over there and that little picture it says March 3rd press</v>

6818
03:00:55.621 --> 03:00:56.340
<v Speaker 1>conference.</v>

6819
03:00:56.340 --> 03:00:56.491
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

6820
03:00:56.491 --> 03:00:57.324
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

6821
03:00:57.330 --> 03:00:58.380
<v Speaker 1>So they don't have a date.</v>

6822
03:00:59.050 --> 03:01:00.010
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine if we're</v>

6823
03:01:00.010 --> 03:01:02.470
<v Speaker 2>looking wordy in March,</v>

6824
03:01:02.470 --> 03:01:02.470
<v Speaker 2>April,</v>

6825
03:01:02.470 --> 03:01:02.470
<v Speaker 2>May,</v>

6826
03:01:02.470 --> 03:01:02.470
<v Speaker 2>June,</v>

6827
03:01:02.470 --> 03:01:02.471
<v Speaker 2>July,</v>

6828
03:01:02.471 --> 03:01:03.281
<v Speaker 2>four months from now.</v>

6829
03:01:03.281 --> 03:01:04.390
<v Speaker 2>That's very reasonable.</v>

6830
03:01:05.620 --> 03:01:05.951
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

6831
03:01:05.951 --> 03:01:06.880
<v Speaker 2>There's something with GSP.</v>

6832
03:01:06.881 --> 03:01:07.690
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want to fight.</v>

6833
03:01:07.690 --> 03:01:07.811
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6834
03:01:07.811 --> 03:01:09.130
<v Speaker 2>that's Sean Jones weekend too,</v>

6835
03:01:09.131 --> 03:01:09.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6836
03:01:09.790 --> 03:01:11.080
<v Speaker 2>that's when Jon Jones returns.</v>

6837
03:01:11.081 --> 03:01:11.914
<v Speaker 2>Jon Jones,</v>

6838
03:01:12.010 --> 03:01:12.120
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

6839
03:01:12.120 --> 03:01:13.370
<v Speaker 2>Anthony Johnson and John Jones.</v>

6840
03:01:14.840 --> 03:01:15.673
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

6841
03:01:17.810 --> 03:01:18.643

6844
03:01:25.871 --> 03:01:27.220

6853
03:01:32.261 --> 03:01:34.900
<v Speaker 2>What happened with you and Michael Bisping on that?</v>

6854
03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:38.740
<v Speaker 2>We heard that there was this crazy argument and there's a video of you guys talk</v>

6855
03:01:38.741 --> 03:01:38.861

6865
03:01:46.030 --> 03:01:47.170
<v Speaker 2>Not For one second.</v>

6866
03:01:47.620 --> 03:01:48.760
<v Speaker 2>Did I think a fight?</v>

6867
03:01:48.761 --> 03:01:49.600
<v Speaker 2>What's going to go down?</v>

6868
03:01:50.110 --> 03:01:50.681
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

6869
03:01:50.681 --> 03:01:50.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6870
03:01:50.950 --> 03:01:51.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6871
03:01:51.161 --> 03:01:51.994
<v Speaker 2>every time I,</v>

6872
03:01:52.540 --> 03:01:53.170
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

6873
03:01:53.170 --> 03:01:53.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6874
03:01:53.590 --> 03:01:55.930
<v Speaker 2>talk about Mike Bisbing or anyone else,</v>

6875
03:01:55.931 --> 03:01:59.470
<v Speaker 2>they usually say if he visibly improves from fight to fight,</v>

6876
03:01:59.471 --> 03:02:00.304
<v Speaker 2>you could see it.</v>

6877
03:02:00.880 --> 03:02:01.900
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

6878
03:02:01.960 --> 03:02:02.171
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6879
03:02:02.171 --> 03:02:06.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he's sick of hearing that and I was talking about that I was</v>

6880
03:02:06.071 --> 03:02:06.904
<v Speaker 2>complimenting him,</v>

6881
03:02:07.180 --> 03:02:10.090
<v Speaker 2>but then I could see how he thought like that implied that,</v>

6882
03:02:10.440 --> 03:02:10.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6883
03:02:10.790 --> 03:02:11.321
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

6884
03:02:11.321 --> 03:02:11.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6885
03:02:11.700 --> 03:02:12.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6886
03:02:12.140 --> 03:02:13.270
<v Speaker 2>subpar at one point,</v>

6887
03:02:13.271 --> 03:02:13.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6888
03:02:13.960 --> 03:02:14.621
<v Speaker 2>so it was like,</v>

6889
03:02:14.621 --> 03:02:16.030
<v Speaker 2>I take offense to that man.</v>

6890
03:02:16.210 --> 03:02:16.530
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

6891
03:02:16.530 --> 03:02:18.860
<v Speaker 2>I was always a bad ass ever since the,</v>

6892
03:02:18.960 --> 03:02:19.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6893
03:02:19.300 --> 03:02:21.250
<v Speaker 2>the ultimate fighter show and I,</v>

6894
03:02:21.251 --> 03:02:21.880
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

6895
03:02:21.880 --> 03:02:22.390
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

6896
03:02:22.390 --> 03:02:23.590
<v Speaker 2>I understand where he's coming from,</v>

6897
03:02:23.740 --> 03:02:23.981
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6898
03:02:23.981 --> 03:02:27.040
<v Speaker 2>so it was just a misinterpretation of what you were describing.</v>

6899
03:02:27.220 --> 03:02:27.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6900
03:02:27.381 --> 03:02:28.570
<v Speaker 2>And then we just started talking about like,</v>

6901
03:02:28.571 --> 03:02:28.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6902
03:02:28.721 --> 03:02:29.750
<v Speaker 2>he's fighting GSP.</v>

6903
03:02:29.770 --> 03:02:30.610
<v Speaker 2>He's a good dude,</v>

6904
03:02:30.910 --> 03:02:31.743
<v Speaker 2>great guy.</v>

6905
03:02:32.290 --> 03:02:32.681
<v Speaker 2>We were,</v>

6906
03:02:32.681 --> 03:02:34.480
<v Speaker 2>we were arguing and he was getting like,</v>

6907
03:02:34.481 --> 03:02:35.710
<v Speaker 2>kind of like insulted.</v>

6908
03:02:35.711 --> 03:02:36.100
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

6909
03:02:36.100 --> 03:02:37.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm insulted when people say that.</v>

6910
03:02:37.511 --> 03:02:37.691
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

6911
03:02:37.691 --> 03:02:38.231
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

6912
03:02:38.231 --> 03:02:39.064
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

6913
03:02:39.280 --> 03:02:39.850
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

6914
03:02:39.850 --> 03:02:41.290
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to compliment you.</v>

6915
03:02:41.320 --> 03:02:41.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

6916
03:02:41.620 --> 03:02:42.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying,</v>

6917
03:02:42.130 --> 03:02:43.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to say good things about you,</v>

6918
03:02:43.931 --> 03:02:45.670
<v Speaker 2>but I see how you could see,</v>

6919
03:02:45.671 --> 03:02:45.941
<v Speaker 2>I should,</v>

6920
03:02:45.941 --> 03:02:46.840
<v Speaker 2>I should have kept my mouth shut.</v>

6921
03:02:46.841 --> 03:02:49.410
<v Speaker 2>Was there a couple of adult beverages going around too?</v>

6922
03:02:49.450 --> 03:02:49.731
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6925
03:02:50.500 --> 03:02:51.333
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

6926
03:02:51.450 --> 03:02:52.870
<v Speaker 2>By the end of that conversation,</v>

6927
03:02:52.871 --> 03:02:53.704
<v Speaker 2>if they didn't have a guys.</v>

6928

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6929
03:02:54.221 --> 03:02:54.461
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

6930
03:02:54.461 --> 03:02:54.641
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

6931
03:02:54.641 --> 03:02:55.440
<v Speaker 2>I should come up and,</v>

03:02:55.440 --> 03:02:56.081
<v Speaker 2>and trying to do,</v>

6933
03:02:56.081 --> 03:02:57.180

6934
03:02:57.190 --> 03:02:57.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6935
03:02:57.401 --> 03:02:58.360
<v Speaker 2>he's going to want to take me down.</v>

6936
03:02:58.361 --> 03:02:59.500
<v Speaker 2>I should get good off my back.</v>

6937
03:02:59.530 --> 03:03:00.341
<v Speaker 2>I'd come up,</v>

6938
03:03:00.341 --> 03:03:00.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6940
03:03:02.940 --> 03:03:05.450
<v Speaker 2>very blessed that he didn't remember.</v>

6941
03:03:05.660 --> 03:03:06.790
<v Speaker 2>So that's what makes him great.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And I should have kept my mouth shut.</v>

6951
03:03:14.110 --> 03:03:17.930
<v Speaker 2>Is was the biggest fight of his life coming up at the ghost.</v>

6952
03:03:17.950 --> 03:03:19.090
<v Speaker 2>These just fight for GSB.</v>

6953
03:03:19.091 --> 03:03:20.380
<v Speaker 2>That's a tough fucking fight.</v>

6954
03:03:20.440 --> 03:03:22.530
<v Speaker 2>It's a business.</v>

6955
03:03:22.570 --> 03:03:23.403
<v Speaker 2>Take down defense.</v>

6956
03:03:23.410 --> 03:03:25.180
<v Speaker 2>Who says it's easiest fight for GSP.</v>

6957
03:03:25.181 --> 03:03:26.014
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

6958
03:03:26.020 --> 03:03:26.890
<v Speaker 2>He's way bigger.</v>

6959
03:03:27.100 --> 03:03:28.720
<v Speaker 2>Michael Bisping is a legit one.</v>

6960
03:03:28.721 --> 03:03:30.220
<v Speaker 2>85 of 42 oh five,</v>

6961
03:03:30.330 --> 03:03:31.810
<v Speaker 2>I remember he won the ultimate fighter.</v>

6962
03:03:31.930 --> 03:03:32.321
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

6963
03:03:32.321 --> 03:03:33.131
<v Speaker 2>Look at that combination.</v>

6964
03:03:33.131 --> 03:03:33.761
<v Speaker 2>Kaz and Kelvin.</v>

6965
03:03:33.761 --> 03:03:36.160
<v Speaker 2>Just circle one to look at that again is shown it again.</v>

6966
03:03:36.520 --> 03:03:37.900
<v Speaker 2>Fucking incredible.</v>

6967
03:03:37.990 --> 03:03:39.430
<v Speaker 2>He looks so good.</v>

6968
03:03:40.930 --> 03:03:41.800
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>

6969
03:03:42.100 --> 03:03:43.080
<v Speaker 2>I'd be one legend.</v>

6970
03:03:43.081 --> 03:03:44.020
<v Speaker 2>So it'd be another one.</v>

6971
03:03:44.440 --> 03:03:44.921
<v Speaker 2>Calls out.</v>

6972
03:03:44.921 --> 03:03:45.720
<v Speaker 2>Spider Anderson.</v>

6973
03:03:45.720 --> 03:03:46.553
<v Speaker 2>The old man.</v>

6974
03:03:47.290 --> 03:03:49.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why it's not.</v>

6975
03:03:49.091 --> 03:03:49.924
<v Speaker 2>It's a good idea.</v>

6976
03:03:50.050 --> 03:03:50.980
<v Speaker 2>Fighting these legends.</v>

6977
03:03:50.981 --> 03:03:51.581
<v Speaker 2>Smoking.</v>

6978
03:03:51.581 --> 03:03:52.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6979
03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:53.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I want to see that man.</v>

6980
03:03:54.820 --> 03:03:55.570
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

6981
03:03:55.570 --> 03:03:56.620
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather see that than him.</v>

6982
03:03:56.621 --> 03:03:57.680
<v Speaker 2>Verse Jocker a or some,</v>

6983
03:03:57.690 --> 03:03:59.180
<v Speaker 2>Derek Brunson seemed like,</v>

6984
03:03:59.690 --> 03:04:01.520
<v Speaker 2>like he was hypnotized by Anderson.</v>

6985
03:04:01.730 --> 03:04:03.120
<v Speaker 2>He got too much respect for him.</v>

6986
03:04:03.440 --> 03:04:04.820
<v Speaker 2>There was moments where in the face,</v>

6987
03:04:04.821 --> 03:04:06.350
<v Speaker 2>so he just didn't seem like,</v>

6988
03:04:06.920 --> 03:04:09.470
<v Speaker 2>it just didn't seem like he found his groove in that.</v>

6989
03:04:09.530 --> 03:04:12.170
<v Speaker 2>Plus he was him coming off of the knockout loss to Robert Whittaker.</v>

6990
03:04:12.620 --> 03:04:15.180
<v Speaker 2>He's on a long tentative little switched the time.</v>

6991
03:04:15.290 --> 03:04:16.123
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6992
03:04:16.130 --> 03:04:18.260
<v Speaker 2>He tried to go a little technical again.</v>

6993
03:04:18.950 --> 03:04:19.730
<v Speaker 2>Bad idea.</v>

6994
03:04:19.730 --> 03:04:20.301
<v Speaker 2>No one wants,</v>

6995
03:04:20.301 --> 03:04:20.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6996
03:04:20.900 --> 03:04:22.100
<v Speaker 2>the fans lost on that fight.</v>

6997
03:04:22.101 --> 03:04:22.934
<v Speaker 2>They'll fight sucked.</v>

6998
03:04:22.970 --> 03:04:23.803
<v Speaker 2>How dare you.</v>

6999
03:04:24.410 --> 03:04:24.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

7000
03:04:24.620 --> 03:04:25.130
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

7001
03:04:25.130 --> 03:04:26.000
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't the most fine.</v>

7002
03:04:26.240 --> 03:04:27.073
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't the best flag.</v>

7003
03:04:27.500 --> 03:04:28.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7004
03:04:28.130 --> 03:04:29.080
<v Speaker 2>Totten Grisham.</v>

7005
03:04:30.490 --> 03:04:31.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

7006
03:04:31.070 --> 03:04:33.080
<v Speaker 2>I honestly have not listened to him at all.</v>

7007
03:04:33.760 --> 03:04:34.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

7008
03:04:34.040 --> 03:04:37.490
<v Speaker 2>because the last time he was doing something we were doing a fight companion.</v>

7009
03:04:37.491 --> 03:04:38.900
<v Speaker 2>So we talked over this work.</v>

7010
03:04:38.990 --> 03:04:39.823
<v Speaker 2>Who's</v>

7011
03:04:41.030 --> 03:04:42.860
<v Speaker 2>Karen Bryant for this?</v>

7012
03:04:42.861 --> 03:04:44.360
<v Speaker 2>I think Canada and then uh,</v>

7013
03:04:44.420 --> 03:04:46.010
<v Speaker 2>he didn't really take Goldberg spot.</v>

7014
03:04:47.270 --> 03:04:47.870
<v Speaker 2>Well he's,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

03:09:58.340 --> 03:10:00.510
<v Speaker 2>That guy's done with the backfill,</v>

7173
03:10:02.210 --> 03:10:04.970
<v Speaker 2>the upper cut that launches the dude upside down and back sheet</v>

7174
03:10:06.740 --> 03:10:07.870
<v Speaker 2>real John.</v>

7175
03:10:07.871 --> 03:10:09.370
<v Speaker 2>Jack was going to be shooting back.</v>

7176
03:10:11.720 --> 03:10:12.590
<v Speaker 2>So they called me up,</v>

7177
03:10:13.020 --> 03:10:13.853
<v Speaker 2>backed out,</v>

7178
03:10:13.980 --> 03:10:14.420
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

7179
03:10:14.420 --> 03:10:14.831
<v Speaker 2>and he goes,</v>

7180
03:10:14.831 --> 03:10:16.060
<v Speaker 2>do we need another villain?</v>

7181
03:10:16.360 --> 03:10:19.000
<v Speaker 2>And I knew Randy couture was thinking about being in movies.</v>

7182
03:10:19.001 --> 03:10:19.301
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

7183
03:10:19.301 --> 03:10:20.410
<v Speaker 2>maybe I could call Randy.</v>

7184
03:10:20.620 --> 03:10:21.640
<v Speaker 2>So I called Randy.</v>

7185
03:10:21.700 --> 03:10:23.050
<v Speaker 2>I know you want to do a movie.</v>

7186
03:10:23.330 --> 03:10:23.560
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

7187
03:10:23.560 --> 03:10:24.281
<v Speaker 2>they need a villain.</v>

7188
03:10:24.281 --> 03:10:25.114
<v Speaker 2>Last minute,</v>

7189
03:10:25.150 --> 03:10:27.150
<v Speaker 2>Randy couture jumped in and he did it.</v>

7190
03:10:27.370 --> 03:10:28.330
<v Speaker 2>So now if we,</v>

7191
03:10:28.331 --> 03:10:29.710
<v Speaker 2>if we do something like this,</v>

7192
03:10:30.460 --> 03:10:33.700
<v Speaker 2>it almost can't be a standalone thing.</v>

7193
03:10:34.330 --> 03:10:36.850
<v Speaker 2>We really almost need some of the dialogue.</v>

7194
03:10:36.890 --> 03:10:37.723
<v Speaker 2>We</v>

7195
03:10:39.330 --> 03:10:40.990

7196
03:10:40.991 --> 03:10:41.880
<v Speaker 2>It's a great movie.</v>

7197
03:10:41.930 --> 03:10:43.660
<v Speaker 2>Now is this a movie that they can get online?</v>

7232
03:11:47.230 --> 03:11:51.160
<v Speaker 2>This is an amazing moving this just like my life in the 80s man,</v>

7233
03:11:51.161 --> 03:11:52.150
<v Speaker 2>when I ran with that game,</v>

7234
03:11:52.180 --> 03:11:53.610
<v Speaker 2>this is my nineties called the,</v>

7235
03:11:54.220 --> 03:11:57.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh this is just taken after it was taken off of my dragon gang that I used to</v>

7236
03:11:57.911 --> 03:11:58.180

7237
03:11:58.180 --> 03:12:03.010
<v Speaker 2>No rules was seriously.</v>

7238
03:12:03.430 --> 03:12:06.910
<v Speaker 2>That was right when the ultimate fighter was made that movie.</v>

7239
03:12:06.911 --> 03:12:08.310
<v Speaker 2>So they're trying to capitalize on that shit.</v>

7240
03:12:08.340 --> 03:12:08.560
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

7241
03:12:08.560 --> 03:12:09.850
<v Speaker 2>they probably didn't know about it yet.</v>

7242
03:12:09.880 --> 03:12:12.910
<v Speaker 2>It was probably like in the process they saw how it really goes down like,</v>

7243
03:12:12.940 --> 03:12:13.940
<v Speaker 2>ah shit.</v>

7246
03:12:20.970 --> 03:12:22.980
<v Speaker 2>I remember reading the script part of what</v>

7247
03:12:26.060 --> 03:12:26.893
<v Speaker 2>they must have.</v>

7248
03:12:27.990 --> 03:12:31.070
<v Speaker 2>I bet if we had a show where we just want to run back to where they should,</v>

7249
03:12:31.360 --> 03:12:32.290
<v Speaker 2>they should be happy.</v>

7250
03:12:32.380 --> 03:12:35.770
<v Speaker 2>I bet if we had a show where we just watch bad movies and did a companion for</v>

7251
03:12:35.771 --> 03:12:36.590
<v Speaker 2>bad motors,</v>

7299
03:14:05.750 --> 03:14:06.583
<v Speaker 3>20 minutes</v>

7300
03:14:09.830 --> 03:14:11.290
<v Speaker 3>series of movies like that,</v>

7301
03:14:11.450 --> 03:14:12.283
<v Speaker 3>you get a bunch of them.</v>

7302
03:14:12.500 --> 03:14:13.580
<v Speaker 3>This is my favorite commercial,</v>

7303
03:14:13.790 --> 03:14:15.030
<v Speaker 3>Patrick Swayze and roadhouse.</v>

7304
03:14:15.040 --> 03:14:16.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting a tiny pony.</v>

7305
03:14:17.530 --> 03:14:17.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

7306
03:14:17.720 --> 03:14:20.510
<v Speaker 3>but Patrick Swayze and Rose House is almost been done to death.</v>

7307
03:14:20.690 --> 03:14:22.370
<v Speaker 3>I live tweeted at once.</v>

7308
03:14:22.371 --> 03:14:24.320
<v Speaker 3>I'll watch the or instagrammed it.</v>

7309
03:14:24.620 --> 03:14:24.861
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

7310
03:14:24.861 --> 03:14:26.600
<v Speaker 3>I realized how homoerotic it is.</v>

7311
03:14:27.170 --> 03:14:28.670
<v Speaker 3>It's insanely homoerotic.</v>

7312
03:14:28.671 --> 03:14:31.640
<v Speaker 3>I went through a whole series of tweets where like I highlighted what their</v>

7313
03:14:31.641 --> 03:14:32.181
<v Speaker 3>quotes were,</v>

7314
03:14:32.181 --> 03:14:33.230
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck they said.</v>

7315
03:14:33.380 --> 03:14:37.330
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to say the gay scene of all time is the volleyball season first top</v>

7316
03:14:37.331 --> 03:14:38.030
<v Speaker 3>gun.</v>

7317
03:14:38.030 --> 03:14:38.310
<v Speaker 3>Go ahead.</v>

7318
03:14:38.310 --> 03:14:40.610
<v Speaker 3>Pull that up to the whole thing that,</v>

7319
03:14:40.730 --> 03:14:41.960
<v Speaker 3>this is an interesting story.</v>

7320
03:14:42.230 --> 03:14:46.130
<v Speaker 3>This is a whole thing that Quintin Tarantino put in a movie,</v>

7321
03:14:46.370 --> 03:14:47.980
<v Speaker 3>but apparently it's something that uh,</v>

7322
03:14:47.981 --> 03:14:49.370
<v Speaker 3>Roger Avery thing,</v>

7323
03:14:49.400 --> 03:14:49.731
<v Speaker 3>there's like,</v>

7324
03:14:49.731 --> 03:14:51.020
<v Speaker 3>you could read it up online,</v>

7325
03:14:51.260 --> 03:14:54.020
<v Speaker 3>but it's apparently Roger Avery theory that,</v>

7326
03:14:54.470 --> 03:14:54.711
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

7327
03:14:54.711 --> 03:14:58.850
<v Speaker 3>Roger Avery would make killing Zoe who's a brilliant actor or brilliant</v>

7328
03:14:59.060 --> 03:14:59.541
<v Speaker 3>director,</v>

7329
03:14:59.541 --> 03:15:03.650
<v Speaker 3>writer and a wound up killing a guy in a drunk driving accident wound up doing</v>

7330
03:15:03.651 --> 03:15:05.810
<v Speaker 3>jail time and it was like tweeting from jail.</v>

7331
03:15:05.840 --> 03:15:06.410
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

7332
03:15:06.410 --> 03:15:08.360
<v Speaker 3>If I remember correctly in the early days of Twitter,</v>

7333
03:15:08.361 --> 03:15:09.171
<v Speaker 3>I'm not making that up.</v>

7334
03:15:09.171 --> 03:15:09.381
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

7335
03:15:09.381 --> 03:15:12.680
<v Speaker 3>Is that isn't that the case was tweeting I think from the early days of jail.</v>

7336
03:15:12.830 --> 03:15:16.310
<v Speaker 3>But this top gun according to Tarantino,</v>

7337
03:15:16.430 --> 03:15:21.430
<v Speaker 3>according to Roger Avery was his theory is like say if you had a theory and you</v>

7338
03:15:22.581 --> 03:15:23.450
<v Speaker 3>were always talking about it,</v>

7339
03:15:23.451 --> 03:15:27.170
<v Speaker 3>you'd polished it up and made it really funny and he told the shop and shop goes</v>

7340
03:15:27.171 --> 03:15:31.280
<v Speaker 3>on like Fox News and starts talking about here's my theory B and like he just</v>

7341
03:15:31.281 --> 03:15:32.450
<v Speaker 3>rattles off your stuff.</v>

7342
03:15:32.690 --> 03:15:34.570
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of what he did allegedly.</v>

7343
03:15:34.580 --> 03:15:35.450
<v Speaker 3>What was he saying about it?</v>

7344
03:15:35.600 --> 03:15:38.090
<v Speaker 3>Well it's just that top gun is gay,</v>

7345
03:15:38.460 --> 03:15:39.111
<v Speaker 3>like couldn't tear.</v>

7346
03:15:39.111 --> 03:15:42.770
<v Speaker 3>And Tito goes through this whole thing about all the different various moments</v>

7347
03:15:42.771 --> 03:15:47.320
<v Speaker 3>where you realize what the hidden subtext is and it's all homosexual isn't</v>

7348
03:15:47.370 --> 03:15:47.631
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

7349
03:15:47.631 --> 03:15:49.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that she's hilarious.</v>

7350
03:15:49.290 --> 03:15:50.250
<v Speaker 3>Can can't play it.</v>

7351
03:15:50.280 --> 03:15:52.070
<v Speaker 3>Oh they'll kick us off of youtube with the,</v>

7352
03:15:52.140 --> 03:15:53.430
<v Speaker 3>but we'll play it after the podcast.</v>

7353
03:15:54.160 --> 03:15:54.993
<v Speaker 3>Volleyball seen that.</v>

7354
03:15:55.220 --> 03:15:55.410
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

7355
03:15:55.410 --> 03:16:00.410
<v Speaker 3>we can't play the Quentin Tarantino dissection of top gun because if we do</v>

7356
03:16:01.530 --> 03:16:04.350
<v Speaker 3>they'll kick us off of youtube cause it's not our context that the actual movie</v>

7357
03:16:04.351 --> 03:16:05.100
<v Speaker 3>right there it is.</v>

7358
03:16:05.100 --> 03:16:06.480
<v Speaker 3>Everything gets kicked off youtube.</v>

7359
03:16:06.481 --> 03:16:07.680
<v Speaker 3>People own their content.</v>

7360
03:16:07.920 --> 03:16:08.281
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

7361
03:16:08.281 --> 03:16:08.791
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

7362
03:16:08.791 --> 03:16:09.601
<v Speaker 3>if you make something,</v>

7363
03:16:09.601 --> 03:16:12.750
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a movie or a song or anything and someone puts it on a youtube</v>

7364
03:16:12.751 --> 03:16:14.670
<v Speaker 3>thing and then puts it up on youtube,</v>

7365
03:16:14.910 --> 03:16:15.420
<v Speaker 3>this shut it.</v>

7366
03:16:15.420 --> 03:16:16.200
<v Speaker 3>They shut it down.</v>

7367
03:16:16.200 --> 03:16:18.660
<v Speaker 3>Shut down for showing a planet earth to the Lizard.</v>

7368
03:16:18.661 --> 03:16:19.494
<v Speaker 3>Grown from snakes.</v>

7369
03:16:19.930 --> 03:16:21.630
<v Speaker 3>They shut it down like minutes.</v>

7370
03:16:21.750 --> 03:16:22.230
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

7371
03:16:22.230 --> 03:16:22.950
<v Speaker 3>Well all those,</v>

7372
03:16:22.950 --> 03:16:27.950
<v Speaker 3>apparently that's one of the most lucrative video segments is the animal tax</v>

7373
03:16:28.501 --> 03:16:32.910
<v Speaker 3>segment because people love watching those animals attack other animals and tag</v>

7374
03:16:32.911 --> 03:16:33.511
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

7375
03:16:33.511 --> 03:16:35.130
<v Speaker 3>And anytime does a video like that,</v>

7376
03:16:35.131 --> 03:16:36.450
<v Speaker 3>if you throw that shit up on Facebook,</v>

7377
03:16:36.451 --> 03:16:37.620
<v Speaker 3>it's going to get your page shut down.</v>

7378
03:16:37.621 --> 03:16:37.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

7379
03:16:37.920 --> 03:16:38.470
<v Speaker 3>it's happening.</v>

7380
03:16:38.470 --> 03:16:41.430
<v Speaker 3>Quickness too quick and they shut my page and I for like three days,</v>

7381
03:16:42.450 --> 03:16:45.750
<v Speaker 3>there are a little bit cooler but it's gonna eventually bleed over to that too.</v>

7382
03:16:45.751 --> 03:16:47.490
<v Speaker 3>Cause doesn't Google own Instagram.</v>

7383
03:16:47.910 --> 03:16:48.990
<v Speaker 3>Facebook owns Instagram.</v>

7384
03:16:48.991 --> 03:16:50.040
<v Speaker 3>So serious is the same thing.</v>

7385
03:16:50.420 --> 03:16:52.370
<v Speaker 3>There's going to hit here's Kinda poster.</v>

7386
03:16:52.400 --> 03:16:53.790
<v Speaker 3>Goddamn fucking reptile.</v>

7387
03:16:53.970 --> 03:16:54.211
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

7388
03:16:54.211 --> 03:16:57.700
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is somebody owns that reptile video on youtube and they're</v>

7389
03:16:57.720 --> 03:17:01.290
<v Speaker 3>making money off the ads and it's real money because a lot of those videos,</v>

7390
03:17:01.320 --> 03:17:02.170
<v Speaker 3>it's hundred percent fair,</v>

7391
03:17:02.820 --> 03:17:03.930
<v Speaker 3>fair look,</v>

7392
03:17:04.020 --> 03:17:04.950
<v Speaker 3>we just want to see it.</v>

7393
03:17:05.190 --> 03:17:05.611
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

7394
03:17:05.611 --> 03:17:07.650
<v Speaker 3>If I can put it up on my page and show everybody,</v>

7395
03:17:07.651 --> 03:17:08.520
<v Speaker 3>and that's cool too,</v>

7396
03:17:08.730 --> 03:17:09.840
<v Speaker 3>but I just want to see it.</v>

7397
03:17:09.870 --> 03:17:11.050
<v Speaker 3>So if people are showing up,</v>

7398
03:17:11.290 --> 03:17:14.310
<v Speaker 3>whatever's going to make sure these people put up more of those videos as good.</v>

7399
03:17:14.340 --> 03:17:14.521
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

7400
03:17:14.521 --> 03:17:17.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm not in the fucking animal tag video business.</v>

7401
03:17:17.191 --> 03:17:17.570
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

7402
03:17:17.570 --> 03:17:18.390
<v Speaker 3>it'd be cool.</v>

7403
03:17:18.390 --> 03:17:21.810
<v Speaker 3>It'd be cool is if you repost a video from planet video,</v>

7404
03:17:21.811 --> 03:17:22.920
<v Speaker 3>whatever planet attacks,</v>

7405
03:17:22.921 --> 03:17:23.970
<v Speaker 3>animal tax,</v>

7406
03:17:24.150 --> 03:17:26.350
<v Speaker 3>and then they get paid no matter what because you're always follows.</v>

7407
03:17:26.460 --> 03:17:27.191
<v Speaker 3>They still get the pay.</v>

7408
03:17:27.191 --> 03:17:31.860
<v Speaker 3>But you can get a show that maybe they want to generate more subscribers under</v>

7409
03:17:31.861 --> 03:17:32.641
<v Speaker 3>their page though,</v>

7410
03:17:32.641 --> 03:17:35.130
<v Speaker 3>and the argument can be made who had it somewhere else.</v>

7411
03:17:35.310 --> 03:17:38.490
<v Speaker 3>It's somehow or another Mike keep people from subscribing to their page.</v>

7412
03:17:38.520 --> 03:17:39.271
<v Speaker 3>That's the argument.</v>

7413
03:17:39.271 --> 03:17:41.870
<v Speaker 3>We did this thing on fighting the kid three day where I had,</v>

7414
03:17:41.950 --> 03:17:46.950
<v Speaker 3>I put on a deer suit and print and put on a lion suit and I had to kind of run</v>

7415
03:17:47.641 --> 03:17:48.360
<v Speaker 3>away from him,</v>

7416
03:17:48.360 --> 03:17:49.680
<v Speaker 3>like on my hands and knees,</v>

7417
03:17:49.681 --> 03:17:51.060
<v Speaker 3>like on my hands and feet.</v>

7418
03:17:51.350 --> 03:17:55.260
<v Speaker 3>It was for the sketch and he would come over and just jump in the air and land</v>

7419
03:17:55.261 --> 03:17:56.010
<v Speaker 3>on me.</v>

7420
03:17:56.010 --> 03:17:57.300
<v Speaker 3>I was so fucking worried.</v>

7421
03:17:57.301 --> 03:17:59.040
<v Speaker 3>My back was going to break every single time,</v>

7422
03:17:59.041 --> 03:18:01.620
<v Speaker 3>but I was just thinking about how ridiculous that fucking sketch was.</v>

7423
03:18:01.670 --> 03:18:03.340
<v Speaker 3>We were both dressed as a little bit rejects.</v>

7424
03:18:03.341 --> 03:18:04.970
<v Speaker 3>Then when we're talking about real animal attacks,</v>

7425
03:18:05.090 --> 03:18:05.610
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

7426
03:18:05.610 --> 03:18:06.540
<v Speaker 3>it was very similar.</v>

7427
03:18:06.680 --> 03:18:06.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

7428
03:18:06.870 --> 03:18:09.660
<v Speaker 3>but it just gives you a nice opportunity to talk about fighter and the kid three</v>

7429
03:18:09.661 --> 03:18:09.841
<v Speaker 3>d,</v>

7430
03:18:09.841 --> 03:18:10.740
<v Speaker 3>which is available now.</v>

7431
03:18:11.830 --> 03:18:13.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know if it has.</v>

7432
03:18:13.200 --> 03:18:14.090
<v Speaker 3>Fox owns that,</v>

7433
03:18:14.990 --> 03:18:19.080
<v Speaker 3>but they're not releasing Barack up.</v>

7434
03:18:19.220 --> 03:18:19.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

7435
03:18:19.420 --> 03:18:23.550
<v Speaker 3>Since we separated a no divorce made all those sketches and now people can't</v>

7436
03:18:23.551 --> 03:18:24.001
<v Speaker 3>watch them.</v>

7437

<v Speaker 3>Everybody's dumb.</v>

7442
03:18:28.050 --> 03:18:29.970
<v Speaker 3>Don't pay from them to do some research.</v>

7443
03:18:29.970 --> 03:18:30.691
<v Speaker 3>You can find the leave.</v>

7444

7449
03:18:44.180 --> 03:18:44.621
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

7450
03:18:44.621 --> 03:18:45.454
<v Speaker 3>that's a good question.</v>

7451
03:18:45.480 --> 03:18:45.811
<v Speaker 3>Five,</v>

7452
03:18:45.811 --> 03:18:47.100
<v Speaker 3>he never not in the UFC.</v>

7453
03:18:47.110 --> 03:18:49.660
<v Speaker 3>He never really performed to the best of his ability in the UFC.</v>

7454
03:18:50.140 --> 03:18:52.030
<v Speaker 3>He also never looked this well.</v>

7455
03:18:52.480 --> 03:18:53.680
<v Speaker 3>Who knows what that's all about.</v>

7456
03:18:53.880 --> 03:18:54.250
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

7457
03:18:54.250 --> 03:18:57.220
<v Speaker 3>but he never looked the same when he came from Strikeforce or excuse me,</v>

7458
03:18:57.350 --> 03:18:58.810
<v Speaker 3>pride over to the UFC.</v>

7459
03:18:59.130 --> 03:19:00.310
<v Speaker 3>The UFC did work.</v>

7460
03:19:00.311 --> 03:19:02.120
<v Speaker 3>Kim K one champion rise.</v>

7461
03:19:02.180 --> 03:19:03.280
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking nuts.</v>

7462
03:19:03.310 --> 03:19:03.790
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

7463
03:19:03.790 --> 03:19:05.770
<v Speaker 3>you know he got back on the Mexican supplements,</v>

7464
03:19:05.771 --> 03:19:06.604
<v Speaker 3>let's be honest.</v>

7465
03:19:06.940 --> 03:19:09.760
<v Speaker 3>But he was also a Mexican summons for a little bit during the UFC.</v>

7466
03:19:09.761 --> 03:19:12.490
<v Speaker 3>Let's be 100% exemption.</v>

7467
03:19:12.520 --> 03:19:13.750
<v Speaker 3>You think he had,</v>

7468
03:19:13.800 --> 03:19:15.100
<v Speaker 3>he was on TRT exemption.</v>

7469
03:19:15.430 --> 03:19:16.263
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

7470
03:19:16.270 --> 03:19:17.140
<v Speaker 3>He had TRT?</v>

7471
03:19:17.170 --> 03:19:18.003
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

7472
03:19:18.400 --> 03:19:19.780
<v Speaker 3>Well don't they have to announce that though?</v>

7473
03:19:19.840 --> 03:19:20.171
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

7474
03:19:20.171 --> 03:19:20.561
<v Speaker 3>Hell No.</v>

7475
03:19:20.561 --> 03:19:22.120
<v Speaker 3>They don't have to know how many people had it.</v>

7476
03:19:22.210 --> 03:19:22.871
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>

7477
03:19:22.871 --> 03:19:23.471
<v Speaker 3>A good amount.</v>

7478
03:19:23.471 --> 03:19:26.860
<v Speaker 3>And then because the floodgates open because once people found out other guys</v>

7479
03:19:26.861 --> 03:19:27.401
<v Speaker 3>were doing it,</v>

7480
03:19:27.401 --> 03:19:29.470
<v Speaker 3>they had to put a stop to it because you have to get,</v>

7481
03:19:29.471 --> 03:19:33.400
<v Speaker 3>go through certain people to get it and then you know,</v>

7482
03:19:33.430 --> 03:19:36.700
<v Speaker 3>it was just a bad look because once you know how if the advantage and everyone</v>

7483
03:19:36.701 --> 03:19:37.534
<v Speaker 3>wants to do it,</v>

7484
03:19:37.690 --> 03:19:37.901
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

7485
03:19:37.901 --> 03:19:41.140
<v Speaker 3>it was weird for a few years because it was legal for a few years and everybody</v>

7486
03:19:41.141 --> 03:19:41.411
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

7487
03:19:41.411 --> 03:19:44.800
<v Speaker 3>what are they doing with Terry do TRT fucked,</v>

7488
03:19:44.820 --> 03:19:46.000
<v Speaker 3>you know the flood gates open.</v>

7489
03:19:46.001 --> 03:19:46.631
<v Speaker 3>But then they're like,</v>

7490
03:19:46.631 --> 03:19:46.841
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

7491
03:19:46.841 --> 03:19:47.560
<v Speaker 3>hell no.</v>

7492
03:19:47.560 --> 03:19:47.880
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>

7493
03:19:47.880 --> 03:19:49.180
<v Speaker 3>Wait that like the,</v>

7494
03:19:49.320 --> 03:19:54.320
<v Speaker 3>she'll levels like you could be doing that stuff every day.</v>

7495
03:19:55.090 --> 03:19:55.791
<v Speaker 3>I mean what,</v>

7496
03:19:55.791 --> 03:19:56.101
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

7497
03:19:56.101 --> 03:19:56.530
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

7498
03:19:56.530 --> 03:19:56.951
<v Speaker 3>what are they,</v>

7499
03:19:56.951 --> 03:20:00.430
<v Speaker 3>as long as you're staying under some ridiculously high level and some of them</v>

7500
03:20:00.431 --> 03:20:01.270
<v Speaker 3>that did get caught,</v>

7501
03:20:01.271 --> 03:20:02.800
<v Speaker 3>like one of the reasons why it got shut down,</v>

7502
03:20:02.801 --> 03:20:07.801
<v Speaker 3>it was when they caught Veit tour and he was at like 1,470 and the doctor was</v>

7503
03:20:08.021 --> 03:20:08.291
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

7504
03:20:08.291 --> 03:20:09.670
<v Speaker 3>well this isn't even healthy.</v>

7505
03:20:09.670 --> 03:20:11.200
<v Speaker 3>Like this is like a dangerous level.</v>

7506
03:20:11.350 --> 03:20:12.580
<v Speaker 3>Same thing with Nate Marquardt.</v>

7507
03:20:12.581 --> 03:20:13.960
<v Speaker 3>When Nate Marquardt got popped,</v>

7508
03:20:14.330 --> 03:20:17.320
<v Speaker 3>supposed to fight Rick story and then he want to fold it fighting Charlie</v>

7509
03:20:17.320 --> 03:20:18.070
<v Speaker 3>Brennan.</v>

7510
03:20:18.070 --> 03:20:19.360
<v Speaker 3>That was last minute replacement.</v>

7511
03:20:19.570 --> 03:20:22.540
<v Speaker 3>It was like they did his levels then went what the fuck's on?</v>

7512
03:20:22.810 --> 03:20:24.840
<v Speaker 3>Like they ain't no way you're fighting like this.</v>

7513
03:20:24.841 --> 03:20:25.810
<v Speaker 3>This is not healthy.</v>

7514
03:20:26.020 --> 03:20:29.110
<v Speaker 3>Like you're on some silver back gorilla levels here.</v>

7515
03:20:29.550 --> 03:20:30.383
<v Speaker 3>Yikes.</v>

7516
03:20:31.750 --> 03:20:32.501
<v Speaker 3>What isn't there,</v>

7517
03:20:32.501 --> 03:20:34.780
<v Speaker 3>aren't there different like there's free testosterone.</v>

7518
03:20:35.740 --> 03:20:36.460
<v Speaker 3>How does that work?</v>

7519
03:20:36.460 --> 03:20:41.100
<v Speaker 3>Well you'd have to talk to a real total is free endocrinologist but with you</v>

7520
03:20:41.101 --> 03:20:43.210
<v Speaker 3>know they would explain what's available to you,</v>

7521
03:20:43.211 --> 03:20:44.470
<v Speaker 3>what your body has to process,</v>

7522
03:20:44.471 --> 03:20:45.280
<v Speaker 3>what you're,</v>

7523
03:20:45.280 --> 03:20:49.600
<v Speaker 3>what your levels are and then they can also find like it all depends on when</v>

7524
03:20:49.601 --> 03:20:50.790
<v Speaker 3>you've eaten a,</v>

7525
03:20:51.080 --> 03:20:52.540
<v Speaker 3>how much sleep you've gotten.</v>

7526
03:20:53.180 --> 03:20:53.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

7527
03:20:53.680 --> 03:20:55.900
<v Speaker 3>If you worked out what kind of a meal you've eaten,</v>

7528
03:20:56.100 --> 03:20:58.840
<v Speaker 3>depending on like that's why these blood tests are kind of ridiculous.</v>

7529
03:20:59.080 --> 03:21:00.130
<v Speaker 3>Like I talked to a doctor,</v>

7530
03:21:00.131 --> 03:21:05.131
<v Speaker 3>literally told me if you wanted your growth hormone levels to show up as low,</v>

7531
03:21:05.830 --> 03:21:08.680
<v Speaker 3>all you would have to do is eat a really heavy meal.</v>

7532
03:21:08.710 --> 03:21:10.270
<v Speaker 3>Like right before you got your blood tested.</v>

7533
03:21:10.420 --> 03:21:14.350
<v Speaker 3>I get like how far before he was like 45 minutes an hour should do it and it was</v>

7534
03:21:14.351 --> 03:21:18.160
<v Speaker 3>just eat a bunch of cheeseburgers and shitty food and fries and milkshakes and</v>

7535
03:21:18.161 --> 03:21:19.030
<v Speaker 3>then just go in there and he goes,</v>

7536
03:21:19.180 --> 03:21:20.560
<v Speaker 3>you'll have such a crash.</v>

7537
03:21:20.980 --> 03:21:21.940
<v Speaker 3>Insulin levels,</v>

7538
03:21:22.630 --> 03:21:23.770
<v Speaker 3>your growth hormone levels,</v>

7539
03:21:23.771 --> 03:21:26.920
<v Speaker 3>everything's going to be all fucked and out of whack because you just threw some</v>

7540
03:21:26.921 --> 03:21:28.090
<v Speaker 3>sludge in your system.</v>

7541
03:21:28.120 --> 03:21:32.530
<v Speaker 3>So how's the best way to check your true resting testosterone over a week?</v>

7542
03:21:32.920 --> 03:21:33.161
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

7543
03:21:33.161 --> 03:21:33.851
<v Speaker 3>you should chest it.</v>

7544
03:21:33.851 --> 03:21:34.900
<v Speaker 3>You should get a mean.</v>

7545
03:21:34.930 --> 03:21:35.401
<v Speaker 3>You should try it,</v>

7546
03:21:35.401 --> 03:21:36.550
<v Speaker 3>test it and should be.</v>

7547
03:21:36.580 --> 03:21:39.100
<v Speaker 3>You should write down what you're eating,</v>

7548
03:21:39.700 --> 03:21:41.230
<v Speaker 3>how much you're sleeping,</v>

7549
03:21:41.440 --> 03:21:42.390
<v Speaker 3>and then you know,</v>

7550
03:21:42.460 --> 03:21:43.990
<v Speaker 3>and then also the,</v>

7551
03:21:43.991 --> 03:21:47.540
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that has big effect on testosterone is how much cholesterol</v>

7552
03:21:47.840 --> 03:21:49.130
<v Speaker 3>and how much saturated fat.</v>

7553
03:21:49.340 --> 03:21:51.140
<v Speaker 3>And people for the longest time of course,</v>

7554
03:21:51.141 --> 03:21:52.220
<v Speaker 3>thought it was the opposite.</v>

7555
03:21:52.221 --> 03:21:53.960
<v Speaker 3>They thought that that stuff is bad for you,</v>

7556
03:21:54.140 --> 03:21:57.710
<v Speaker 3>but now they realize that's actually the precursors for testosterone and other</v>

7557
03:21:57.711 --> 03:21:58.760
<v Speaker 3>hormones and fat,</v>

7558
03:21:58.761 --> 03:21:59.511
<v Speaker 3>saturated fat.</v>

7559
03:21:59.511 --> 03:22:03.080
<v Speaker 3>Your body needs cholesterol and saturated fat to convert to testosterone.</v>

7560
03:22:03.320 --> 03:22:06.470
<v Speaker 3>So when one of the things that people find in John Rollo found this out,</v>

7561
03:22:06.830 --> 03:22:08.300
<v Speaker 3>he was one of the first people to tell me about this.</v>

7562
03:22:08.301 --> 03:22:11.510
<v Speaker 3>When he switched up to a Keto diet,</v>

7563
03:22:11.900 --> 03:22:13.610
<v Speaker 3>his testosterone went way up.</v>

7564
03:22:13.730 --> 03:22:14.563
<v Speaker 3>He was way up.</v>

7565
03:22:15.860 --> 03:22:16.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

7566
03:22:16.340 --> 03:22:17.173
<v Speaker 3>It happens with a lot of,</v>

7567
03:22:17.400 --> 03:22:18.233
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

7568
03:22:18.760 --> 03:22:19.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

7569
03:22:19.070 --> 03:22:20.330
<v Speaker 3>Your insulin levels are very,</v>

7570
03:22:20.331 --> 03:22:20.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

7571
03:22:20.760 --> 03:22:20.970
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

7572
03:22:20.970 --> 03:22:21.270
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

7573
03:22:21.270 --> 03:22:21.571
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

7574
03:22:21.571 --> 03:22:25.480
<v Speaker 3>your whole state like during the day changes because you don't have the,</v>

7575
03:22:25.510 --> 03:22:26.570
<v Speaker 3>the crash thing.</v>

7576
03:22:26.690 --> 03:22:31.690
<v Speaker 3>Like last night I ate in the late afternoon and then I didn't eat this morning</v>

7577
03:22:32.480 --> 03:22:36.410

7588
03:23:00.080 --> 03:23:00.581
<v Speaker 3>And when,</v>

7589
03:23:00.581 --> 03:23:01.580
<v Speaker 3>when you do that,</v>

7590
03:23:01.610 --> 03:23:02.443

7593
03:23:10.701 --> 03:23:11.600
<v Speaker 3>I'd be frantic,</v>

7594
03:23:11.840 --> 03:23:15.410
<v Speaker 3>like really frantic and he won't be able to think and stuff even when my energy</v>

7595
03:23:15.411 --> 03:23:16.131
<v Speaker 3>levels are perfect.</v>

7596
03:23:16.131 --> 03:23:18.050
<v Speaker 3>I did two sets last night at the store.</v>

7597
03:23:18.230 --> 03:23:18.830
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>

7598
03:23:18.830 --> 03:23:19.670
<v Speaker 3>No problems.</v>

7599
03:23:19.970 --> 03:23:20.240
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

7600
03:23:20.240 --> 03:23:20.421
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

7601
03:23:20.421 --> 03:23:22.760
<v Speaker 3>when you live off fat it's wave as opposed to glucose.</v>

7602
03:23:22.761 --> 03:23:22.991
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

7603
03:23:22.991 --> 03:23:23.680
<v Speaker 3>you definitely,</v>

7604
03:23:23.680 --> 03:23:23.980
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

7605

<v Speaker 3>your appetite is way more suppressed.</v>

7606
03:23:26.510 --> 03:23:27.321
<v Speaker 3>Way more suppressed.</v>

7607
03:23:27.321 --> 03:23:27.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

7608
03:23:27.980 --> 03:23:29.750
<v Speaker 3>Just for that benefit alone.</v>

7609
03:23:29.780 --> 03:23:33.560
<v Speaker 3>I like it just that because it keeps me from thinking about it so much because</v>

7610
03:23:33.561 --> 03:23:34.040
<v Speaker 3>when I'm,</v>

7611
03:23:34.040 --> 03:23:34.540
<v Speaker 3>when I go,</v>

7612
03:23:34.540 --> 03:23:35.570
<v Speaker 3>like I fucked up,</v>

7613
03:23:35.660 --> 03:23:36.470
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

7614
03:23:36.470 --> 03:23:38.450
<v Speaker 3>maybe a week or so ago,</v>

7615
03:23:38.480 --> 03:23:39.800
<v Speaker 3>not even last weekend.</v>

7616
03:23:39.830 --> 03:23:40.051
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

7617
03:23:40.051 --> 03:23:40.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

7618
03:23:40.280 --> 03:23:41.113
<v Speaker 3>But we can go,</v>

7619
03:23:41.240 --> 03:23:42.280
<v Speaker 3>I took uh,</v>

7620
03:23:42.320 --> 03:23:44.930
<v Speaker 3>like one Sunday and I went off.</v>

7621
03:23:44.960 --> 03:23:45.740
<v Speaker 3>That's a good time.</v>

7622
03:23:45.740 --> 03:23:46.940
<v Speaker 3>I had pizza,</v>

7623
03:23:46.941 --> 03:23:48.680
<v Speaker 3>I had a Cuban sandwich,</v>

7624
03:23:48.950 --> 03:23:51.830
<v Speaker 3>I ate all this bread and shitty food.</v>

7625
03:23:52.250 --> 03:23:56.510
<v Speaker 3>And then I took me like a few days for my body to get back into a state of</v>

7626
03:23:56.511 --> 03:23:57.081
<v Speaker 3>ketosis.</v>

7627
03:23:57.081 --> 03:23:59.120
<v Speaker 3>But once I did that man,</v>

7628
03:23:59.180 --> 03:24:04.010
<v Speaker 3>I was so hungry like soon as my body started flipping over to the calorie to the</v>

7629
03:24:04.011 --> 03:24:06.650
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrate side because you need any more glucose because your body,</v>

7630
03:24:06.651 --> 03:24:08.080
<v Speaker 3>you go through glucose very quickly,</v>

7631
03:24:08.720 --> 03:24:10.100
<v Speaker 3>you only have a few hours of it.</v>

7632
03:24:10.101 --> 03:24:11.420
<v Speaker 3>So you have a meal hungry again.</v>

7633
03:24:11.421 --> 03:24:11.661
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

7634
03:24:11.661 --> 03:24:13.860
<v Speaker 3>Your body is a few hours of it and then you got to refuel again.</v>

7635
03:24:13.860 --> 03:24:16.100
<v Speaker 3>It's really interesting too to have to go soon.</v>

7636
03:24:17.020 --> 03:24:21.260
<v Speaker 3>So I have a set [inaudible] store you on tonight too.</v>

7701
03:25:48.950 --> 03:25:52.290
<v Speaker 2>Just just give us the biggest radio all the time.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you go through the corners.</v>

7709
03:26:02.610 --> 03:26:04.110
<v Speaker 2>There should be an option for fight,</v>

7710
03:26:04.200 --> 03:26:05.033
<v Speaker 2>fight companion.</v>

7720
03:26:29.911 --> 03:26:34.350
<v Speaker 2>but the reality is way more people listen to this then then watch these fights</v>

7721
03:26:34.830 --> 03:26:35.740
<v Speaker 2>and that's true.</v>

7722
03:26:37.830 --> 03:26:38.581
<v Speaker 2>The last one.</v>

7723
03:26:38.581 --> 03:26:38.881
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

7724
03:26:38.881 --> 03:26:39.714

7727
03:26:43.471 --> 03:26:47.160
<v Speaker 2>we've got as many as 7 million people downloading and watching these things.</v>

7728
03:26:47.161 --> 03:26:47.810

03:26:49.220 --> 03:26:50.011
<v Speaker 2>I start doing my hair,</v>

7732
03:26:50.011 --> 03:26:53.250
<v Speaker 2>but it's like there's no way this got 7 million people.</v>

7733
03:26:53.430 --> 03:26:54.870
<v Speaker 2>This may maybe got a million.</v>
