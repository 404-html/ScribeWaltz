00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.550
will be gone.
Oh my God.
It's so good.

2
00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.030
That's not really Brian.
That's Jamie.
What does Brian,

3
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.040
Brian's a off doing the Kevin Pereira podcasts.
Hello Party people.

4
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.480
What the fuck?

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.860
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.730

10
00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:40.320
very smart guys who I'm sure are smart enough to know that audio books are the

11
00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:44.490
shit.
It's a great way to take them a foundation.
Yeah,

12
00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:45.720
but if you don't know about it,

13
00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:48.510
go to audible.com and get yourself a free audio book.

14
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.440
I recommend the war of art by Steven Pressfield,

15
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.710
an excellent book on overcoming procrastination when it comes to artwork and

16
00:00:58.651 --> 00:01:03.540
doing things and not just whoa,
no phone,
no computer.

17
00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:06.160
Everybody's good
it.
Um,

18
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.710
it's an excellent way of commuting.
It's my favorite thing for audio books.

19
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.070
It's the best because otherwise you're stuck in your car and it sucks.

20
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.550
I was stuck in my car on the way over here and I was listening to an audio book

21
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.510
and it was fucking bad ass.
Um,
use like I got like I said,
uh,
odd.

22
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.380
Well Tom Ford Slash Joe,

23
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.500

25
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.300
the opiate Anthony Radio shows on there,
which is the shit.
So,
uh,
go get yourself.

26
00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:38.400
Some were also spawn,

27
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.430
we're also sponsored by legal zoom and a legal zoom is if you do some stupid

28
00:01:43.771 --> 00:01:48.050
shit and now you can't,
don't do it that way.
Legal Zoom is,
uh,

29
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.030
is a lot of shit that you go to a lawyer for.
That's really annoying.

30
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.020
And a would basically it is,
is uh,
you know,

31
00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.000
things like if you want to incorporate and become an LLC,
that shit takes,

32
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:02.850
it's a huge pain in the ass.
You got to talk to some dude,

33
00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:07.320
you have to go somewhere and give some guy who has knowledge of all this shit,

34
00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:09.200
a lot of money.
And it's annoying as fuck you.

35
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.050
You don't want to meet with somebody with a tie exact a Mundo son.

36
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.470
Yeah.
Cops might be waiting for you.
Yeah.

37
00:02:16.471 --> 00:02:19.880
Some duties worth like 500 bucks an hour.
For what?
What do you,

38
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.090
what's going on here?
What are you protecting me from?
Why is it so complicated?

39
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.250
Legal Zoom is not a law firm.
Now.

40
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.700
They provide self help services at your specific direction.

41
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.790
So they also can connect you with an independent attorney if you need additional

42
00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:37.620
guidance.
Like if you like,
oh,
this sucks.
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

43
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.140
Let me get a professional in here.

44
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.670
They'll connect you with an independent attorney.
Uh,

45
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.900
but it's really easy for things like LLCs or a,
if you want to make a will.

46
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.270
Um,
you know,
there's a lot of things that you could do online and uh,

47
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.890
do it far cheaper than you would if you went to an attorney.

48
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.500
And if you use a code name,
Rogan,

49
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.760
you'll save yourself even swap money.
Uh,

50
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.000
we're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com that's o,
n n,
I,
t.

51
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.640
The,
a new gorilla kettle bells or in a,
if you haven't seen him.

52
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.990
Oh my God,
that looks so the,
the,
the,
the fucking coolest thing ever.

53
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.920
Some guy was like,
as soon even practical,
like shut up.
Stupid.

54
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.660
Of course it's not practical.
Life is not all about being practical.
God dammit.

55
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.900
You got to have some cool looking shit,
man.

56
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.510
Like to see that as a piece of evidence in a criminal trial.

57
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.540
Sometimes a man would like himself,
a gorilla kettle bell.

58
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.840
Look at her face on that mother fucker.
I think that's you.

59
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.850
I need one of those in my life.
So look at that.

60
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.280
You as a monkey motivates you to work out,
doesn't it?
You look at,
that's it.

61
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:46.870
That's how I feel.
I,
I know I'm dead fucking scared man.

62
00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:48.400
I want to lift weights quickly.

63
00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:51.030
I want to get strong as fuck when I see that face.
That's funny face.

64
00:03:51.031 --> 00:03:55.330
He has to get shit out of me.
Motivational Macy was lifting in American beauty.

65
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.950
It's a really awesome gorilla face.
The dude,
the dude who did it,
I again,

66
00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:02.030
I have to get that information from Aubrey.
I'll,

67
00:04:02.031 --> 00:04:05.860
I'll get to the artist's name because they're fucking wicked.
The chimpanzee,

68
00:04:05.861 --> 00:04:10.390
which is 35 pounds,
and the gorilla,
which is 72 pounds.

69
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.800
I liked the word enlarged.
Yeah,
that's,
they have big fat cock candles.

70
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.870
And the reason being is that the,
the wider handles are harder to hold onto.

71
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.760
So it makes it more difficult to work for grip better.
It would,

72
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.590
I could lift that thing once with two hands.
That would be the under my workout.

73
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.280
Well,
you just,
if you wouldn't start with that anyway,
but you could do it.

74
00:04:30.281 --> 00:04:32.890
Anybody can do kettle bells.
The beautiful thing about kettlebells,
it's,

75
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.300
it's a pretty natural human movement and when you do a lot of them,

76
00:04:37.301 --> 00:04:40.180
it really connects to athletics,

77
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.170
whether it's a martial art or,
you know,
and I think anything you would do,

78
00:04:44.171 --> 00:04:46.030
and I think rock climbing,
I think anything,

79
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.240
I think what kettle bells do is it strengthens your entire body as a unit.

80
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.250
It's a Russian system.
They developed it.
Those bad motherfuckers.
Oh Man.

81
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.250
All gangster.

82
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.020
Well they figured out some wild shit with this kettle bell cause the shape of
it,

83
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.591
you know,

84
00:05:02.591 --> 00:05:06.610
and if there's never been a more versatile tool for fitness and in my opinion

85
00:05:06.611 --> 00:05:10.060
you can get so much done and you could burn yourself out with one 35 pound

86
00:05:10.061 --> 00:05:12.160
kettle bell.
That sounds so girl.

87
00:05:12.161 --> 00:05:16.210
Like you tell like a real manly man football player type dude at the gym that

88
00:05:16.211 --> 00:05:18.790
you can work out with 35 pounds and they'd be like,

89
00:05:18.791 --> 00:05:23.380
what the fuck you talking about?
You kick is huge with 35 pounds.
I crap.

90
00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.560
Right foot pounds.
I was doing this workout once and this,
uh,

91
00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:29.430
this dude actually said that to me because I can't believe how little you're

92
00:05:29.431 --> 00:05:32.830
lifting.
I was like,
God damn dude,

93
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.850
it's not about the amount.
How much lips?
I'm going to say he was a child,

94
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.550
move his arms,
his giant man.
He had leg,
arms,
legs,
arms,
arms,

95
00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:44.140
the size of legs and just ridiculous.

96
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.650
I had to ride in the car with a guy like that.
He had to shuffle steer.
Yeah,

97
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.280
he was a football player.
He was a college football player.

98
00:05:51.281 --> 00:05:55.430
The students was very friendly.
Goddamn.
He was just ridiculously huge and I,

99
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.370
here's how I was working out with 50 pounds,
50 pound dumbbell.

100
00:05:58.371 --> 00:06:02.960
I have this whole workout like circuit that I do like this.
This is hard,

101
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.430
not a small thing.
Bust your ass with one.

102
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.060
If you know what you're doing and you have a series of things and you don't
rest,

103
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.810
there's,
there's a bunch of shit you could do with a 50 pound dumbbell cleans.

104
00:06:14.811 --> 00:06:16.070
If you did like a series of cleans,

105
00:06:16.071 --> 00:06:19.750
presses and chin ups with a or a pushups with them and,
and you know,

106
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.980
squats with them and just kept going like rep after rep after rep if you,

107
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.370
you know,
if you can work out with a 50 pound kettle bell like you can,

108
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.420
you can get a serious work on it and you can get like a real light heart attack

109
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.820
ready to die,
ready to shit your pants work out.

110
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.720
That's my better half 50 pound kettlebell one with the gorilla face on it.

111
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:40.423
Exactly.

112
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.050
Use the code name Brogan and you can save 10% off any and all the supplements,

113
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.440
uh,
including the delicious hemp force protein.

114
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.650
That's hemp force is beautiful because of two things.
One,

115
00:06:51.651 --> 00:06:55.220
because it does taste delicious.
It's like the most high quality Hampton,

116
00:06:55.221 --> 00:07:00.030
we could find any,
we have a rom Makkah and a raw cocoa.
So it's,
it's,

117
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:05.000
it's,
it's really like a delicious flavor.
It's also,
um,
it's um,

118
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.780
sweetened with Stevia,
so it's not sugar.
There's no,

119
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:13.810
there's like less than one gram or less sugar per serving and then that's just

120
00:07:14.091 --> 00:07:15.770
natural from the hemp hemp itself.

121
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.440
It's really delicious stuff and really good for you.

122
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:22.880
And we can't even grow it in America.
We have to buy this shit from Canada.

123
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.180
They have to buy it from Canada.
We're in on that in Congress.

124
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.440
They're working on that in Congress.
It's one of the dopiest things of all time.

125
00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:31.910
If you don't know if you've heard this podcast,

126
00:07:31.911 --> 00:07:34.640
you probably heard me complain about it,
but if you don't know it,

127
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.140
you should Google it.
Google why hemp became illegal.

128
00:07:39.141 --> 00:07:42.350
It'll drive you crazy.
It's not even like psychoactive.

129
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.880
The stuff that they make clothes out of the stuff.
No good.

130
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:50.510
It's all because the other people who are,
have those businesses locked down,

131
00:07:50.511 --> 00:07:53.840
whether it's the paper industry,
whether it's the pharmaceutical industry,

132
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:54.980
whether they're like,

133
00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.370
this is no way you're even getting that up cousin of that fucking thing.
Legal.

134
00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:00.650
Alright,
think about it.

135
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.150
So literally the cousin of weed that doesn't get you high is illegal too.

136
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.310
And is there a better marketing tagline then?

137
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.640
It's not even legal in this country.
That's the bad marketing,

138
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.050
but it's even stupider because it is legal in this country.

139
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.340
We just can't grow it here where you can buy it,

140
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:20.110
we can buy it from Canada and then we can only,
because it's so,
it's,

141
00:08:20.111 --> 00:08:21.800
it's hard to get the highest quality stuff.

142
00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:26.120
We can only buy 50 pounds of this shit a day and that's all you can get because

143
00:08:26.121 --> 00:08:29.270
they just,
everybody's trying to buy it because we can't grow it in America.

144
00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:33.470
Like farmers are fucked because first of all,
we have,
excuse me,

145
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:38.800
way easier to grow like a weed corn to get infested by bugs.

146
00:08:39.921 --> 00:08:43.910
Like good luck getting weed infested.
Yeah,
we will fight off every bug.

147
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.000
What do you ever heard about anybody losing a crop to bugs?

148
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:51.620
I may have experienced some worms.
Really outdoor.

149
00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:56.400
It's like a big foot story.
I'll and worms.
It was.
It required

150
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.320
<v 1>tweezers and a lot of fucking time,
man.</v>

151
00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:02.280
What do you tell how many days work Mandela?
Jenny,

152
00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:05.420
you would dump more than I would.
I believe so.
I'll go with you.
Well,

153
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.370
I was talking shit.
Let me know later.
I was talking a little shit.

154
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.860
I will let you know later.
But you're still plugging things.

155
00:09:10.861 --> 00:09:14.210
You're like fucking marathon right now.
It's over.
It's over the marathon zone.

156
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:19.170
You were so entertaining.
Brogan are such a brand.
So marketable.

157
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.920
I have to pay for bandwidth in this table.
So table,

158
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:28.440
I got the nice table.
Reclaimed.
Yes it is.

159
00:09:28.441 --> 00:09:32.700
It's old Russian lumber,
something like that.
I made that up.

160
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:37.630
Now it's like a,
it's a farm like a hundred year old oak.
They saw those.

161
00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:42.750
I don't really go to the factory,
so it's fucking really a hundred years old.

162
00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.810
Brown,
have you been through the Midwest?

163
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.390
Like those parts of Detroit that were gone?

164
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:52.260
West is emptied out some crises and then we think,

165
00:09:52.261 --> 00:09:53.880
shit that's a hundred years old is old.

166
00:09:53.881 --> 00:09:58.881
I was just in England hanging out at my buddy's house was built in 1450 hang

167
00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:03.140
drinking in a pub buddy Earl or says,
you know Chris Harris,
right?
You don't have,

168
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.620
let's let,
let me just end this.
Press the press.

169
00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:12.460
No,
no.
We have to start to music.
We have two different parts of the podcast.

170
00:10:12.461 --> 00:10:13.740
Like we're serious picks it up.

171
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:21.780
I mean it's a good way to do this thing.
Doesn't kick in,
does it means we don't,

172
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:24.050
it's not like officially started.
I mean we have,

173
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.570
we've abandoned that tactic at least a half a dozen times in the past.

174
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.130
I tried to have some sort of semblance of a control that too.
Yeah,
for sure.

175
00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:33.330
But it's more like,

176
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:38.250
like pageantry and I like to start at so stupid.

177
00:10:38.251 --> 00:10:40.870
I know.
It's stupid.
I do it.
Anyway.
Showbiz tradition.

178
00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:45.180
What separates the pros from that?
This arm,

179
00:10:45.181 --> 00:10:47.790
this arm right here is all it takes.
Yeah.
You gotta have one of them.

180
00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:52.230
You want the part?
Yeah,
I've had like those table mounted ones.

181
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.530
We have the table mountain one.
I like to compare.
Hold on to take this shit.

182
00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:59.130
The whole on the tables to move.
I feel like you're a goddamn professional.
Yeah.

183
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.970
Yeah.
Once you start drilling hundred year old wood,

184
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:06.300
there's not the clamp on the side,
like the college lamp.

185
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.690
The architect lamp with a c clamp.
No,
there's a hole in this table.

186
00:11:09.691 --> 00:11:12.990
There's a hole in this table isn't perfect.
Yes.
We had it set up.

187
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:18.600
That's Todd Mesereau who is the executive producer of my new TV show,

188
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:23.010
which is a Joe Rogan questions,
everything and this is Matt Farah.
Matt Farah is,

189
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:28.340
if you are a fan of cars and you fan of cool car videos,

190
00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:31.650
you might already know him.
You might know him from drive or the smoking,

191
00:11:31.651 --> 00:11:36.540
tire.com the crepe plug.
Cho.
I enjoy you.
I enjoy your,
your videos,

192
00:11:36.541 --> 00:11:41.040
man.
I really do.
I think they're really fun.
The first one I saw was you have a,

193
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:42.780
you were in a Ferrari four,
five,

194
00:11:42.781 --> 00:11:45.720
eight in like New Jersey or had the Russian guy in the trunk.

195
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.410
I don't remember a Russian guy in the trunk of a Ferrari to demonstrate how big

196
00:11:49.411 --> 00:11:52.920
a trunk it had.
It was smuggling immigrants.
What I liked about it better,

197
00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:57.570
God's like,
you were just like a fun dude who was checking out bad ass cars.

198
00:11:57.571 --> 00:12:01.240
It was being yourself.
Whereas like next up,

199
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:06.270
the new Ford Fairlane amazing dual clutch transmission.

200
00:12:06.551 --> 00:12:11.020
Like there's like this fake goofy voice that's so many dudes had and those car

201
00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:12.070
video seriousness,

202
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:16.840
they ruined cars like watching car videos to me because I'd be like,

203
00:12:16.841 --> 00:12:18.040
you stuffy motherfucker.

204
00:12:18.041 --> 00:12:22.480
Let's grab this bull by the horns and see if we hang on and you'd be better off

205
00:12:22.481 --> 00:12:23.830
just letting you look at the car.

206
00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:27.400
But I think all credit due to the original top gear,
right?

207
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:29.670
They're the guys who like started cracked it open.
Right?

208
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:33.860
Pretty much like for a sense of humor and Tommy Clarkson.

209
00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:39.100
Now Todd Todd worked on the reboot of the u s top gear.

210
00:12:39.101 --> 00:12:43.300
This is where Matt and I and we met with Adam Carolla as as the Jeremy Clarkson

211
00:12:43.301 --> 00:12:46.390
character and Tanner Foust and he hadn't,
they call Todd got up,

212
00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:48.520
found me and called me to audition for that,

213
00:12:48.521 --> 00:12:53.380
the u s top gear and I didn't make it.
You made it to the final round.

214
00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:55.480
You would have been good.
I would've been.

215
00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:58.090
I might've been good as history has proven because look at you.

216
00:12:58.091 --> 00:13:00.730
You know you had a speed show from his top gear.

217
00:13:00.731 --> 00:13:02.980
It tends to be the little scripted.
I don't do scripted.

218
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.460
I think that's why you were spine.
Just talk.

219
00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:08.820
You guys are kind of alike that way.
Yeah.
I'm well,

220
00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:12.310
Adam Ferrara is a good buddy of mine from back in New York.
Great,
isn't he?

221
00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.730
He's a sweetie pie.
I love that dude.
He's a great,
great guy.

222
00:13:15.731 --> 00:13:17.860
I've been friends with him forever.
We were pool playing buddies.

223
00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:20.310
I wish they let him talk a little more on that show.
Well,
yeah.

224
00:13:20.311 --> 00:13:23.920
You know what it's like.
They're,
the things are,
they're funny when they like,

225
00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:28.120
like he had a really funny one with a corvette Zr one who's like defending

226
00:13:28.121 --> 00:13:30.970
America and the stupidity of a corvette Zr one.

227
00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:34.960
And Tanner had this beautiful Ferrari and right.
You know,
and it was a,

228
00:13:34.961 --> 00:13:36.850
it was funny like Ferrara that was like,

229
00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.690
you could tell like Ferrara had a saying that his queens,
you know,

230
00:13:40.691 --> 00:13:44.680
Italian is unlocked.
It's unlocked.
Got that market fully covered.

231
00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:46.070
But it's like the,

232
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:51.300
I can't help but when I see them standing up just like Jeremy Clarkson and

233
00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:54.820
Richard Harris is,
that was his name.
Hammond.
Richard hammered and the other dude,

234
00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:58.750
what's the other dude?
Slow James May,
James May.
Those guys,

235
00:13:58.751 --> 00:14:01.300
when I see them standing up,
that's like,
they would have been doing that forever.

236
00:14:01.301 --> 00:14:04.490
That's their shit.
And when you repeat age over the stance,

237
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:08.380
but when you see like Adam and Tanner doing this,

238
00:14:08.381 --> 00:14:10.810
it's like you guys are just like,
you're doing what they did,
right?

239
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.490
Like you don't have to do what they did.
Yeah.

240
00:14:12.491 --> 00:14:14.920
You don't even have to call it top gear.
Just do a good car.
Shit.

241
00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:18.460
I kind of sell the brand,
you know,
that's how the television industry,

242
00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.010
I know it's a hit show,
it'll be a hit show here.

243
00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:25.780
They've managed to take three really entertaining guys who know a lot about cars

244
00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:28.570
early come kind of boring.
That's going to help me drive.

245
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.560
The best part about drive is it lets people be themselves.

246
00:14:32.561 --> 00:14:35.230
So you have distinct characters who are generally,

247
00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.540
they're the same if you meet them in real life.

248
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:42.560
And I knew it when Todd sent me the final cut of the u s top gear that had Adam

249
00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:45.670
in it.
Adam Carolla,
we call that my last episode.

250
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:52.190
I watched it and I go,
holy fuck,
this is a very good top gear cover band.

251
00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.720
So
you know,

252
00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:00.160
I couldn't watch it cause it was too strange.
But you know what that,

253
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.460
that Tanner Foust guy's really good.
He's a really good driver.
First of all,

254
00:15:04.461 --> 00:15:06.650
he can drive on the mother fucker.

255
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:12.440
He's intense and like he like,
he's very engaging.
When he communicates.

256
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.510
He did a thing on the corvette,

257
00:15:14.511 --> 00:15:19.511
z o six and it was racing against a motorcycle and it was fucking Donald.

258
00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.440
That was awesome,
dude.

259
00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:27.450
They had these fucking crazy cargo crate set up and they essentially put this

260
00:15:27.451 --> 00:15:32.450
like obstacle course together and he's racing a motorcycle around this obstacle

261
00:15:32.451 --> 00:15:36.830
course and he's going sideways around corners and catching it perfect.

262
00:15:36.831 --> 00:15:40.490
And just going clean into these lines with this fucking corvette.

263
00:15:40.491 --> 00:15:42.470
Z O six he did a,
he did a,

264
00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:46.160
he's got a real video after like mastering block.
Yeah.

265
00:15:46.161 --> 00:15:49.410
I mean after Jim [inaudible] came out,
Tanner wanted some of that action.
Yeah,

266
00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.700
so he did,
he did the Mulholland drive street drift video.

267
00:15:52.701 --> 00:15:53.990
I remember that video yet.

268
00:15:53.991 --> 00:15:57.740
It's PSI on formula drift car and went up the snake on Mulholland,

269
00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:03.100
but he made a very big deal out of doing it in one take and not having any tire

270
00:16:03.501 --> 00:16:06.230
marks be there to show multiple takes.

271
00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:11.620
So I was there when he did it and he drifted the entire snake once and it was

272
00:16:12.111 --> 00:16:15.770
like,
whoa.
Oh my God,
this,
he's nuts.
But he's,

273
00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:20.180
people got to know what that means.
What is drifting.
The snake means when,

274
00:16:20.181 --> 00:16:22.760
when someone has a very powerful sports car,

275
00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:26.900
you can manipulate the way the car steers with the throttle,

276
00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.630
but it requires a very delicate touch.

277
00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:33.110
You have to really know what you're doing and to go up a crazy path.

278
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:36.980
The windy road like road called the snake man.
I mean just imagine,

279
00:16:36.981 --> 00:16:40.520
you know the most fan film that was Ryan there from Ryan was there filming that

280
00:16:40.521 --> 00:16:42.350
and I filmed the behind the scenes.

281
00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:46.040
They spent a lot of money and we spend no money and we got half the view.

282
00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:50.480
So one of my favorite videos of all time,
I don't know if you've ever seen it,

283
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:55.130
is a gt three on a mountain road.
Jamie puts,
see if he could pull that up.

284
00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:58.070
Gt three and a mountain road.
Jeff's wart video,

285
00:16:58.071 --> 00:17:01.010
I don't know who this bad motherfucker has a code.

286
00:17:01.011 --> 00:17:06.011
This guy crushing a gt three on a mountain road in this is going sideways around

287
00:17:06.051 --> 00:17:09.830
corners.
There's like ledges,
I mean Pike's peak or I don't know where it was.

288
00:17:09.831 --> 00:17:11.390
Just says gt three and a mountain road.

289
00:17:11.391 --> 00:17:13.580
I think if I feel like it was somewhere in Europe,

290
00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:18.740
but homeboy was fa lie gang up this mountain road and you're just shitting your

291
00:17:18.741 --> 00:17:23.741
pants sweating while you're watching and he's going sideways blog and you're

292
00:17:24.231 --> 00:17:26.250
with him while he's doing this cat.

293
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:31.870
This mother fucker can drive.
Dude,
this guy's going for it.

294
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:36.320
I don't know where he's going,
Chris Harris.
I don't think it is.

295
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:39.470
I don't think this one's Chris Harris with Chris Harris says many of these.

296
00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:44.060
It looks like you're a baby.
I get Invidi in cars with a lot of people.

297
00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:48.070
You know he really fucking scares me.
He cause he really,

298
00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:50.060
he was going what I would do.

299
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:55.680
<v 2>That's nice.
Look at this motherfucker.
Woo feet from a brick wall.</v>

300
00:17:55.681 --> 00:17:59.100
He's sliding sideways hitting the gas on the time.

301
00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:02.840
That looked a lot like Chris Harris for a second.
Hey,
it might be him.

302
00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.950
It could be,
that's something he would do.

303
00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:09.750
He was going what I would consider a fucking race pace on a Welsh back road.

304
00:18:09.751 --> 00:18:11.150
You know,
and I'm hitting I,

305
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.610
it's right hand drive cause we're in Wales so I'm in the where the driver would

306
00:18:14.611 --> 00:18:19.260
normally be and hearing the reads against the mirror,
you know,

307
00:18:19.261 --> 00:18:22.500
as we're going a hundred down a one lane road blind corners,
crazy.

308
00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:26.160
Have you seen the video of him testing out the new gt three?
Yes.
Yeah.

309
00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:30.420
Pull that up.
Gene.
Chris Harris,
nine nine one one gt three is what I did.
Come on.

310
00:18:30.421 --> 00:18:33.920
Your show is talking about Chris Harris.
He was,
you're talking about life,

311
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:35.480
talking about life.
We're going to love this,

312
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:40.470
but did you got my attention all night?
Thanks.
Thank you.
Thank you man.

313
00:18:40.471 --> 00:18:45.470
Thanks man.
Those videos like guys like Chris Harris,
guys like you.

314
00:18:45.471 --> 00:18:45.810
They're like,

315
00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:49.770
there's those videos didn't exist just a few years ago and they've made like,

316
00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:52.810
what's really fun is that like,

317
00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:56.370
I would like to sit down with a Chris Harris.
I like to hang out with that dude.

318
00:18:56.371 --> 00:18:59.220
I like to hang out with you.
You know,
I'd like to show people that like,

319
00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:04.130
it's not like a Steffi,
a stuffy like stiff presenter,
right?
It's like they're,

320
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:08.270
they're being honest about what these fucking things like a child like

321
00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.790
appreciation for cars,
you know what I mean?
It's almost like a toy.

322
00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:14.190
[inaudible] Chris is like a child.

323
00:19:14.191 --> 00:19:17.550
He's like half of my fucking size and Tanner looks like a child even though he's

324
00:19:17.551 --> 00:19:20.810
40 Tanner Foust,
youngest looking 40 years.

325
00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:24.990
You been in a car with him with Tanner?
Yes it is.
You know,

326
00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.210
you're sitting in the seat and you and he,

327
00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:30.360
the funny thing is I love when people try and scare the shit out of you.

328
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:33.960
Like I was in a power boat doing 90 I was in the back seat and they're looking

329
00:19:33.961 --> 00:19:36.750
back like they're waiting for me to puke and because they're having fun,

330
00:19:36.751 --> 00:19:40.110
they're trying to fuck with me.
I'm not really a fan of that tank.
But Tanner,

331
00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:43.950
I never had a moment of fear cause Tanner just has this touch and you just,

332
00:19:43.951 --> 00:19:46.350
you know,
you're sitting in the car.
He was going to be fine.

333
00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:49.260
Can I tell you my favorite Tanner Foust story?
It's not very long,

334
00:19:49.261 --> 00:19:52.890
but I promise you'll like it.
I actually,
I got him in a lot of trouble,

335
00:19:52.891 --> 00:19:56.820
but I figure I can only get him in trouble for this story once so I can tell it

336
00:19:56.821 --> 00:19:57.570
again.

337
00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:01.560
So there was a thing called the octane academy in Detroit where they had a bunch

338
00:20:01.561 --> 00:20:06.561
of media come out and do four different driving disciplines with different pros.

339
00:20:06.631 --> 00:20:07.170
Okay.

340
00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:12.170
So the stunt driving section was with Tanner on a wet skid pad in a Ford focus

341
00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:17.290
the night before.
It was von Gittens birthday and volumes,

342
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.260
a formula drift driver.
And he was there too.

343
00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:23.970
And Ken Block was there and a and Brian Deegan,
another four drivers there.
So,

344
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.790
and I know those guys.
I was like,
I'm getting you fucked up tonight.

345
00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:32.420
And I got Tanner like blackout drunk whiskey that night and the next day he was

346
00:20:32.881 --> 00:20:37.080
so hung over and Todd could tell you Tanner's a terrible passenger.

347
00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.990
Amazing driver,
terrible passenger.

348
00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:44.310
And so he was riding shotgun with people who for the most part,

349
00:20:44.311 --> 00:20:48.010
we're not very good drivers learning how to do three on

350
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:48.760
<v 1>a wet skit.</v>

351
00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:53.500
Bad like handbrake turns the after a full night of drinking whiskey with me,

352
00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.830
he was the most miserable hate him.
Oh Man.

353
00:20:56.831 --> 00:21:00.190
And then I published a picture of him drunk and give me the finger on Facebook

354
00:21:00.191 --> 00:21:03.040
and he had an a la Trobe.
Sorry Tanner.
Publicly.

355
00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:10.910
It never ends.
The Fun with cars.
No.
Yeah,
there's a video of Tanner,
uh,

356
00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:15.340
test driving a Porsche gt two rs,

357
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.990
that crazy fucking new one.
Nine line seven,

358
00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.320
the only new Porsche that really wants you dead.
It's so scary,
that thing.

359
00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:27.220
And he's going sideways around corners with it in downtown La.

360
00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.970
They cordoned off parts of downtown La to fail.
I don't know.

361
00:21:30.971 --> 00:21:33.730
You know how the Oh yeah.
The streets are saying,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

362
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:38.290
So I saw that'd be fun to do the terrifying,

363
00:21:38.291 --> 00:21:42.070
I don't know how to fucking drive like that.
If I found myself going sideways,

364
00:21:42.071 --> 00:21:43.300
that'd be shitting my pants.

365
00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:48.870
I was at willow springs one day and Jason Statham shows up in a gt two and I

366
00:21:49.781 --> 00:21:53.410
love Jason Statham.
I was fucking site and he was the nicest guy in the world.

367
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:57.190
And he smelled exactly like you'd expect Jason State them to smell.

368
00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:02.170
You smell them close enough.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And like I could just like,

369
00:22:02.171 --> 00:22:06.680
man,
like a man smells like he smells like a moan or like a real smell.

370
00:22:06.681 --> 00:22:10.980
Smells like he could be ravaging of vagina within five seconds of going on

371
00:22:10.981 --> 00:22:15.730
though.
And,
and I didn't get that impression.

372
00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:18.280
I met him,
seemed like a really nice guy.

373
00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:20.290
I didn't think he was going to get me pregnant.

374
00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.810
So he has a g and he's never been on a race track before and you know,

375
00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:32.230
200 miles on it.
Oh No.
So he's like,
all right,
anybody got a helmet?

376
00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:35.800
And I was like,
Oh,
here you go man.
I gave him my helmet.
Oh No.

377
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:37.480
And he went out on the track,

378
00:22:37.481 --> 00:22:40.840
on the streets of willow and turned one.

379
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:43.980
Exited the track.
It's such an extraordinary rate.

380
00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:48.910
Oh my first term.
Oh my God.

381
00:22:48.911 --> 00:22:52.780
He didn't make it one corner.
She's a poor guy.
Oh man,

382
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.680
I don't if you've never driven something like that before.
Yeah,

383
00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.670
you don't want to hit it.
Right.

384
00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:02.840
Those are really tricky to gt two is a turbo for folks who are not up on the

385
00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:05.470
Porsche terminology and with turbo,

386
00:23:05.471 --> 00:23:07.320
even though they've kinda got it licked with the,

387
00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:12.130
there's something called turbo lag.
They've Kinda got it licked but not totally,

388
00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:16.630
there's still like a little flexibility to like the way the power gets delivered

389
00:23:16.631 --> 00:23:19.950
and the tires break away.
So easy.
Yeah.

390
00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.710
So you're dealing with this weird out a touch feeling for how much power gets to

391
00:23:23.711 --> 00:23:24.210
the engine,

392
00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:28.740
wears what people really like is a naturally aspirated engine because you,
you,

393
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:32.820
you sell it,
you feel it,
you feel like there's no instant throttle.

394
00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:36.520
The feedback is appropriate,
but that gt two is yet please.

395
00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:40.990
It's super stupid powerful.
And it's a turbo and it's two wheel drive.

396
00:23:40.991 --> 00:23:45.710
It's not four wheel drive,
so it's just a recipe for chaos.
100% disasters.

397
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:49.220
Porsche horsepower is a little bit different from other horsepower.
Like,

398
00:23:49.221 --> 00:23:50.570
for instance,
the,
uh,

399
00:23:50.571 --> 00:23:55.571
us a 520 horsepower Porsche turbo is way faster than a 660 horsepower Shelby

400
00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.600
Mustang.
Different thing.
Yeah.
And like,

401
00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:05.620
like for instance I ran and where the engine,
yeah.

402
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:10.400
And I ran a corvette zr one at the Mojave mile and I ran a one one 76 and the

403
00:24:10.401 --> 00:24:14.210
standing miles was zero to 176 miles an hour at one mile.

404
00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:19.130
A Porsche turbo out of the box does one 84,
which is a big deal.

405
00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.280
It's a big difference for a car that has 120 less horsepower.

406
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:26.750
So these things are stupid,
stupid,
fast.
And if you don't know what you're doing,

407
00:24:26.751 --> 00:24:30.890
you're probably going to die.
Yeah.
You have a stupid fast forward.

408
00:24:30.891 --> 00:24:33.970
What's up with your car?
Your three Rs?
The shark works car.
Yeah,

409
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:37.190
it's a stroker motor,
right?
502 horsepower.

410
00:24:37.191 --> 00:24:40.350
They take a 3.6 and take it to 3.9 and it's,

411
00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.410
it's probably is all for people don't know cars.

412
00:24:42.411 --> 00:24:45.590
This is all their fucking poke in their ears with pencils.
Right now

413
00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:50.170
your crowd is ruling.

414
00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:57.080
I'm,
I'm absolutely fascinated by performance cars,
like real performance cars,

415
00:24:57.081 --> 00:24:57.914
cars that handle,

416
00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:01.640
you know like I've had muscle cars before and I love them for a different
reason.

417
00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:06.650
You just said that I kind of first became a fan of you a with the Carlos Mencia

418
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:09.020
thing,
which,
which was fucking great.

419
00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:14.260
And then when I saw the sick fish on fucking ride some shit as it rides,

420
00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:19.320
it was a car.
I mean it probably did it drive good.
It looks good.
It I'm,

421
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:22.270
it drove like a rhinoceros on roller skates.

422
00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:27.410
Nobody wants I guess the same muscle cars drive like the ass,
but they do.

423
00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:31.680
Some of them don't.
I'm like,
you know they,
I know you know about XV motor sports.

424
00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:35.570
I know.
What do you think about that?
Have you driven it?
I've driven XV card.

425
00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:39.290
It's very nice.
They did their very expensive,
it's like a singer Porsche.

426
00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:43.730
It's crazy expensive.
Exactly.
But they're dope.
Yeah.
I know.

427
00:25:43.731 --> 00:25:45.710
Someone who could build you something just as nice for less money.

428
00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:50.420
That kind of style is very appealing to me.
But the old style,

429
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:53.700
the old style of like ancient suspension,
ancient breaks.

430
00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.240
You can go fuck yourself.
I have no needs it.

431
00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.150
It's like dressing up as a civil war.
Reenactor yeah,

432
00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:02.530
like I don't want to wear wool underwear way better shit.

433
00:26:02.531 --> 00:26:06.910
There was some dudes want that old steamer and wheel brakes.

434
00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:09.760
They want everything.
They want to be in a time machine.
Essentially.

435
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.540
They go to the fucking [inaudible] fucking me and you want to go find that

436
00:26:14.541 --> 00:26:17.300
boombox and throw it off a bridge.
Who wants to be old?

437
00:26:17.301 --> 00:26:20.480
I don't want to be old to new shit.
The shit that works.

438
00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:23.600
What is it about folks that really love those numbers?

439
00:26:23.601 --> 00:26:27.440
Matching old cars though to the point where they collect the most money.

440
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:31.210
The most money cars are the low mileage old cars.

441
00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.400
That's a history thing and it's a hot wheel.

442
00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:37.640
It's like a really expensive hot way.
I think they're stupid.

443
00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:42.020
I have an uncle that bought a 65 corvette like I think he bought it essentially

444
00:26:42.021 --> 00:26:44.050
as an investment.
That's

445
00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:47.340
<v 2>a good ass numbers matching.
He'll,
he'll make money.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.</v>

446
00:26:47.341 --> 00:26:48.620
It's a convertible.
He's like,

447
00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.780
I think he's driven that thing four times mean his whole life and seeing the

448
00:26:51.781 --> 00:26:55.650
prices of of recent some days off recently.
It's crazy.
Yeah,

449
00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:59.250
I have some of them like it's for certain like numbers matching cards that are

450
00:26:59.251 --> 00:27:00.180
difficult to find.

451
00:27:00.181 --> 00:27:05.181
Like you see insane was $7 car for 26 Hemi built on a Thursday with rally wheels

452
00:27:08.011 --> 00:27:08.940
and green stripes.

453
00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:15.360
On the other hand,
I didn't want to tell Todd before the podcasts,
cause I've,

454
00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:18.430
I've bought two cars in the last three weeks.
Fine.

455
00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:22.680
So one of them was a Chevy volt and it's my commuter car.

456
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:25.440
I can debate the merits of electric car and news,

457
00:27:25.441 --> 00:27:27.390
how Douchey I am in fucking 10 minutes.

458
00:27:27.391 --> 00:27:32.391
But the other one is more pertinent conversation because I bought a 1982 barn,

459
00:27:33.421 --> 00:27:38.421
find numbers matching Delorean with 2000 miles.

460
00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:41.360
I saw you're no longer a store.

461
00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.780
It's a Delorean for folks who don't know what that is.

462
00:27:45.781 --> 00:27:49.500
That's the back to the future car.
If you a stainless steel.

463
00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:52.470
And if you were around when I was a kid,
that's um,

464
00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:57.120
when there was that famous case,
what happened?
John Delorean,

465
00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:58.230
who created the company,

466
00:27:58.231 --> 00:28:01.910
was trying to raise money to keep the company going and he'd be selling some

467
00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:06.900
coke or something.
May or may not have a low blow blankets.
It's unknown.

468
00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:11.850
I mean,
he got off right Denise?
Yes,
he got off but off of the company was done.

469
00:28:11.851 --> 00:28:14.730
So he got off but the company was killed.

470
00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:18.750
So there was a company that swept in after they went bankrupt and bought all of

471
00:28:18.751 --> 00:28:20.310
their assets.
Okay.

472
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:24.810
And a guy named Steven Wynn bought the assets from this company and opened up

473
00:28:24.811 --> 00:28:25.980
shop in Texas.

474
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:31.310
So he has the entire Delorean factories worth of parts and it's the official

475
00:28:32.131 --> 00:28:35.850
restoration place.
And they do a couple hundred restorations a year.

476
00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:39.460
They have enough parts.
People love these cards.
They have enough bars,

477
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:43.850
thousand brand new complete cars.
That's how many parts they have for Deloreans.

478
00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.300
That's incredible.
So I can,

479
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:49.650
it would be the same specs as they were back in the 1991 for 56 grand.

480
00:28:49.651 --> 00:28:53.670
They'll build you a brand new 1981 delorean right now and,

481
00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:57.960
and so I bought it.
I got this car,
blue cal blue plates,

482
00:28:57.961 --> 00:29:01.710
original blue plates on it.
2000 miles.
That's big Deckard Dorks,
right?

483
00:29:01.711 --> 00:29:05.040
The original blue plate.
That's a big data nerd thing.
But they're in such,

484
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:08.130
they're brand new.
The cars were going to fucking storage unit for 30 years.

485
00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:12.720
Who found it?
They did.
They did.
They knew I was looking and they called me.

486
00:29:12.721 --> 00:29:17.190
And so,
and they're doing a restoration but with new brakes,
new HVAC,

487
00:29:17.191 --> 00:29:21.540
new electronics,
same engine,
same engine,
but they're hot.
Rodding it up a bit.

488
00:29:21.541 --> 00:29:24.420
The stage to upgrade how many horsepower?

489
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:28.200
215 horsepower with the car only weighs 2,700 pounds.

490
00:29:28.201 --> 00:29:31.010
So it's roughly an eighties nine 11 Howard or wait,
yeah,

491
00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:34.230
so that's my nerd mobile that I just bought and I'm site.

492
00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:37.560
Why they have the doors that you know going towards,

493
00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:39.960
I didn't know they were that light.
Yeah,

494
00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:43.570
it's you guys in the stainless steel body over a fiberglass monocoque.

495
00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:45.640
That's why it's why they're very light.

496
00:29:45.641 --> 00:29:47.340
Also why they don't go around corners very well.

497
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.950
It's not much of a driving experience evidently.

498
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:57.430
Does it just make you smile when you say,
because dude,
I,
you know,
I use unique.

499
00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:00.610
Are you,
do you think that everything needs to go zillion miles an hour?

500
00:30:00.611 --> 00:30:03.640
Are you one of those people?
No.
No,
not at all.
Not at all.

501
00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:06.310
I used to think that now I sit and fucking traffic all day.

502
00:30:06.311 --> 00:30:08.260
So I bought a volt that's called wisdom,

503
00:30:08.261 --> 00:30:13.090
that wisdom and I bought a Delorean automotive driving slow.
Well,
there's no,

504
00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:17.440
listen,
I,
there's no need to drive fast,
you know,

505
00:30:17.441 --> 00:30:18.330
I already got to ask really?

506
00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:21.640
You can scars every now and then drive fast every now and again.

507
00:30:21.641 --> 00:30:25.600
But just driving cars is fun.
Yeah.
Good.
Do you remember when you were a kid?

508
00:30:25.601 --> 00:30:28.690
The first time you get to drive a car you're like,
Holy Shit,
I'm driving.

509
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:33.670
You know,
like,
I can't believe I'm in the street.
Like we should still enjoy it.

510
00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:36.910
Well,
the Delorean was the car when I was four.

511
00:30:36.911 --> 00:30:41.200
My Dad brought me a car magazine and I was flipping and I saw the Delorean with

512
00:30:41.201 --> 00:30:44.980
the gullwing doors and it looked like from the future and it was like,

513
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:49.510
that was the car that made me think that cars could be something more than like

514
00:30:49.511 --> 00:30:53.430
what my mom took me to fucking preschool in.
Right.
You know,
it's not a to,

515
00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.030
that's it.
There's no wrong,

516
00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:58.690
there's no reason for buying a Delorean besides,

517
00:30:58.691 --> 00:31:02.470
it will appreciate in value over time.
And it's what I want.
That's it.
And it's,

518
00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:06.630
it to me represents what they thought the future was gonna look like.

519
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:10.600
That's really strange how it missed.
You know,

520
00:31:10.601 --> 00:31:14.530
like whenever the people like look to like design something that's going to be

521
00:31:14.531 --> 00:31:19.360
like this is the future car had flying cars but no cell phones and what the

522
00:31:19.361 --> 00:31:23.080
fuck.
After a while though,
they still look clunky.
It's weird.

523
00:31:23.081 --> 00:31:26.180
Like they don't ever totally get it.
Like have you seen the Time magazine?

524
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:31.230
Do you know the demand minster fuller three wheeled car and it's

525
00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:38.950
like a motorcycle?
No,
the rear wheel steers.
Wow.
Like a Cessna without wings.

526
00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:41.410
Yeah,
that's exactly.

527
00:31:41.411 --> 00:31:45.940
It looks like a spaceship fuselage with three two wheels in the front and one

528
00:31:45.941 --> 00:31:50.770
wheel in the back and it had all these safety features.
Like what?
He goes,

529
00:31:50.771 --> 00:31:55.771
I had trucks that seat belts in the 20s look at a whipping donuts.

530
00:31:56.201 --> 00:31:57.910
Right?
Oh my God.
That's ridiculous.

531
00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:01.630
That doesn't look like your dream of the future.
When they made that,

532
00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:03.670
that looks like a giant Usb port,

533
00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.630
like one of those little cute little beak USB sticks that you stick in your lap.

534
00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:14.210
That's amazing.
Yeah.
Cause you had all the cables going.

535
00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:17.410
This is the guy he designed the geodesic dome.

536
00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:19.960
He was one of those genius engineers.

537
00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:24.520
There's one in the valley that I've seen.
There's one in Malibu to his up on,

538
00:32:24.521 --> 00:32:28.900
up off a ladder.
Go Canyon structure,
isn't it?

539
00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:31.570
It's a weird structure,
but it exists in nature.

540
00:32:31.571 --> 00:32:36.100
They found something called Buckminster Fuller Marine and it's that weird shape.

541
00:32:36.101 --> 00:32:40.100
You know all the different sides.
Naturally they

542
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:40.580
<v 1>named,</v>

543
00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:44.450
they named these things they found in nature after Buckminster fuller because it

544
00:32:44.451 --> 00:32:48.950
has the same shape as the geodesic dome.
Wow.
That's crazy.

545
00:32:48.951 --> 00:32:53.540
So he came up with it independently.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's amazing.

546
00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:56.960
And then they went and found it and Bucky balls,
they're called now

547
00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:03.520
Splore superconducting materials and all this other high and super geeky tech

548
00:33:04.581 --> 00:33:08.110
stuff that I only half understand.
I just know the words.
Yeah,

549
00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:12.550
those geodesic domes.
And when they,
when they start finding,
um,

550
00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.870
one of the weirdest things that I ever saw about,
uh,

551
00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:17.120
plants and the shapes of plants was a,

552
00:33:17.121 --> 00:33:19.910
the FIBONACCI sequence when they started showing it,

553
00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.340
and I was watching this swear on sunflower seeds.

554
00:33:22.341 --> 00:33:26.930
They're showing how sunflowers the golden,
yeah.
The Acropolis in Athens.

555
00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:28.910
Yeah.
Well for folks who don't,

556
00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:33.890
I'm not even remotely skilled enough in mathematics to really explain the

557
00:33:33.891 --> 00:33:34.740
FIBONACCI seen these,

558
00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:40.300
I think it's essentially zero and then one and one and two and two and one is

559
00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:45.310
few.
Added the numbers up.
Yeah.
You add hope.
That's right.

560
00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:50.300
I'm pretty sure that's what it is right there.
That's it.
Yeah.
So it's,
yeah.
Two,

561
00:33:50.301 --> 00:33:54.050
three,
five.
You know what else uses that same golden mean Aston Martin,

562
00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:57.390
every single one of their cars.
If you measure that's interesting.

563
00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:01.040
Heights and lengths and widths of certain things all over the car.

564
00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:03.050
I used that same even today,

565
00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:06.950
like in the size of the grill versus how high the nose of the car is off the

566
00:34:06.951 --> 00:34:10.970
ground.
The window versus the whole.
Makes Sense.
We're statically beautiful car.

567
00:34:10.971 --> 00:34:14.030
That is that those Aston Martin cars are stunning of love.

568
00:34:14.031 --> 00:34:17.480
That they're works of art.
They're like modern works of art.
The drive.
Yeah.

569
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:20.960
They really are.
I have an older one.
It's awesome.
Dan Cook had one though.

570
00:34:20.970 --> 00:34:25.670
He said it.
He had flood,
he was on the podcast and he was talking about,

571
00:34:25.671 --> 00:34:29.140
he said he thought he was fucking James Bond.
He taught,
he's like Cube Cube shoe.

572
00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:32.030
Like pretending like shooting people out of his car was drunk and he goes,

573
00:34:32.031 --> 00:34:35.840
it was such a piece of shit.
He was like laughing about how it broke down.
Oh,

574
00:34:35.841 --> 00:34:39.110
I haven't had an issue with in a year.
You know,
it's like wine.

575
00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:42.310
There's good years and bad years of British cards.
What happened those days?

576
00:34:42.311 --> 00:34:47.160
Old stuff,
man.
You've got to roll the dice.
Sometimes it's be spoke.
Um,

577
00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:51.380
I'm the only problem that fucking exactly.
First I had a nine,

578
00:34:51.381 --> 00:34:55.310
nine six turbo Porsche nine nine six turbo that broke down five times

579
00:34:55.311 --> 00:34:56.730
catastrophic failure.

580
00:34:57.510 --> 00:35:00.990
We'll shrink years and Jen had to be replaced.
Um,

581
00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:06.010
the clutch linkage disappeared twice where I was backing out of a parking spot.

582
00:35:06.141 --> 00:35:11.090
Just claim claimed to claim completely loose,
no gears,
couldn't do shit.

583
00:35:11.091 --> 00:35:16.040
Had to get towed twice.
Once the fuel pump blue and once the gas gauge died,

584
00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.210
nine,
nine,
six is,

585
00:35:17.211 --> 00:35:21.810
or like the fucking bottomless pit Porsches Friday afternoon,

586
00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:26.030
six career right now for like eight grand.
Yeah,
it's amazing.

587
00:35:26.031 --> 00:35:30.140
It's amazing because they're very good car.
It's a very good car.

588
00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:32.620
But like the nine,
nine threes,

589
00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:36.700
which weren't as technologically advanced or like more expensive and air.
Cool.

590
00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:40.550
The Porsche people are all about that air cooled.
Yeah.
They love that.

591
00:35:40.551 --> 00:35:43.170
Why is that?
Why is it because their traditionalist.

592
00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:46.080
What about fucking dude?

593
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:48.570
I don't know who's worse portion Mueller,

594
00:35:48.571 --> 00:35:51.130
Ferrari people that I think they're equally horrible now.

595
00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:52.710
Ferrari there we'll have more money.

596
00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:55.890
There's second BMW people who think they're rich,

597
00:35:55.891 --> 00:35:59.940
but aren't you driving?
If you're driving a Ferrari,

598
00:35:59.941 --> 00:36:03.600
you're really Paulin.
If you driving a Porsche,
you probably can't afford it.

599
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:10.350
I always remember that line from entourage.
Kevin does a goal.
You just lease it.

600
00:36:10.351 --> 00:36:14.220
That's so all the assholes in this town drive nine 11 it's true,

601
00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:18.470
I'm sure,
but at Lino leasing it,
if it works,
great deal.

602
00:36:18.471 --> 00:36:21.990
You get to drive a sweet fucking car that you could never really afford and just

603
00:36:21.991 --> 00:36:24.030
give that shit back after you've beat the shit out of.

604
00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:29.220
I'm going to auto cross that Shin.
Why not off road with a volt?

605
00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:34.140
We're about to do 500 miles off road,
bro.
Tomorrow.
Isn't this a,

606
00:36:34.141 --> 00:36:37.970
this is a really cool time if you enjoy cars because even the,

607
00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:41.490
there's a bunch of American cars that have caught up like this and these new

608
00:36:41.491 --> 00:36:46.491
Camaro's the and the ss that's coming out or not the not the ss to the Chevy ss.

609
00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:51.450
What is the,
no,
there's,
there's a new Camaro that's coming out.

610
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:54.110
It has a corvette engine.
Oh,
there's a,

611
00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:59.040
the z 28 28 28 is a race version where it only has one speaker.

612
00:36:59.041 --> 00:37:03.270
So that you can hear the seatbelt.
Ding,
Ding,
Ding.
That's it.
No radio,
no bullshit.

613
00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:08.450
And it's like 30003000200 pounds and fucking 500 horsepower.

614
00:37:08.671 --> 00:37:13.470
Naturally aspirated and magnetic fiber brakes,
carbon fiber brakes standard.

615
00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:17.610
It's going to be just a radical [inaudible] grand and I handle like a mother

616
00:37:17.611 --> 00:37:20.270
fucker.
That magnetic,
they're valued.

617
00:37:20.271 --> 00:37:23.610
This car is the best thing they make is the mid,
the magnetic ride suspension.

618
00:37:23.611 --> 00:37:27.510
Yeah.
I had a Zl one and I couldn't believe how far between.

619
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:33.540
No,
no,
no,
no.
It's a much more crude.
It's a different sort of,

620
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:38.520
but it's also a third of the price that it is a wicked fucking car,
man.

621
00:37:38.521 --> 00:37:40.810
That's a real legit sports cars.

622
00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:46.920
Eight views.
What's that?
You got to pull the number eight fuse.
If you buy one,

623
00:37:46.921 --> 00:37:49.380
that's the electronic exhausts.
Baffles.
If you pull it,

624
00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:53.380
they stay wired open all the time.
They have sport thing.
Yeah,

625
00:37:53.381 --> 00:37:57.210
we can press you always drive by noise regulations.
They suck.

626
00:37:57.270 --> 00:38:00.420
That's so silly.
That's why I have to have them.
My card it.

627
00:38:00.421 --> 00:38:04.260
Fuck that lack of your own car.
You are.
You are radical.

628
00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:08.520
I'm fucking low cats.
You're contributing to global warming.
What about the seals,

629
00:38:08.521 --> 00:38:13.110
man?
Are you saying that 800 miles a year I was driving that car contributes to

630
00:38:13.111 --> 00:38:17.130
Goldman.
When I bought,
I bought a volt fucker.
When I bought the Karma thing,

631
00:38:17.131 --> 00:38:20.970
I like,
Hey,
think Joey,
he can wait a thing.
Buys carbon offsets,
right?
I do.
I buy,

632
00:38:20.971 --> 00:38:24.540
I bought the volt and then the raptor a corvette and it's a good mood.
Yeah,

633
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:27.630
that's a good mood.
That's why my wife drives a Prius.
Well,
you know,

634
00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:30.870
in five years they'll have some new technology that siphons carbon out of the

635
00:38:30.871 --> 00:38:34.530
air and powers our homes and they'll get mad at you if you don't drive your car

636
00:38:34.531 --> 00:38:38.440
enough because it is not a car.
That energy at the empire weren't flourish.

637
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:39.251
You know,
there'll be,

638
00:38:39.251 --> 00:38:42.120
they'll figure out a way to suck pollution out of the atmosphere and actually

639
00:38:42.121 --> 00:38:45.750
turn it up and use it as fuel.
And when they did,
when and if they did,

640
00:38:45.751 --> 00:38:47.740
they're going to fucking do it.
Someone's got to do it.
It's out there.

641
00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:51.360
There's gotta be a really smart idea because just coming and going,

642
00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.900
there'll be mad at us for not driving enough.

643
00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.730
They'll tell us if you start driving old cars,

644
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.080
old shitty cars that will bring back letters.

645
00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:01.120
All the fucking cars in the in the world don't offset like,

646
00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:05.620
like ships and planes
or ships,

647
00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:10.540
diesel emissions,
anything running back and forth constant.

648
00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:15.310
We should go back to sail boats.
Little fuel out,
sailboats,
sailboats.
Well,

649
00:39:15.311 --> 00:39:18.860
you know,
we should go back and get,
just have assholes row.
Right?

650
00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:21.013
How's that?

651
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:26.030
We haven't grown making them grow your down voted as a youtube comment or you

652
00:39:26.041 --> 00:39:29.740
have to row.
That's perfect.
Youtube.

653
00:39:29.741 --> 00:39:34.590
Commentors is there ever been a vial or group of human beings and lowest legacy

654
00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.270
stairs?
Lowest form of life on the planet?
Well,

655
00:39:37.271 --> 00:39:40.960
it's not just what it is is the Internet commentators in general.
It's like,

656
00:39:40.961 --> 00:39:44.110
and it's not.
It's totally in general and a lot of your coolest fuck,

657
00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:47.470
no doubt about it.
But there's a lot of people,
I get a lot of cool.

658
00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:50.140
I may interact with a lot of cool people online.
No doubt about it.

659
00:39:50.141 --> 00:39:54.630
I like the online cannot.
So there's so many people out there that just try to,

660
00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:58.580
will you let go to their Twitter page and they're just continent up with every

661
00:39:58.581 --> 00:40:03.220
word.
Talking Carlin about this.
Me and Dan Carlin,
we were having a conversation.

662
00:40:03.221 --> 00:40:06.970
It's true though because you have nothing else to do or they like it.

663
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.620
There's people that like getting you angry.
But if you saw them on the street,

664
00:40:11.621 --> 00:40:13.990
probably they'd be the most timid.
Well,
he responded well.

665
00:40:13.991 --> 00:40:18.820
He was never do anything.
You know,
unfortunately they beat me a lot,
which sucks.

666
00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.410
They fucking wind,
which really pissed.
I,
I've,

667
00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:26.450
I've like resigned from Youtube commenting like three times,
like as many times.

668
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:28.840
Like you can't help yourself or you like the Alec Baldwin,

669
00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:33.220
you're a fun guy and anyone who's a fun guy can easily be criticized.

670
00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:35.770
It's easy to criticize anybody who drives fast cars.

671
00:40:35.771 --> 00:40:38.650
It's easy to criticize anybody who compares cars to tits and ass,

672
00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:42.510
but it's also fun.
That is a way to make a living,
isn't it?
Nothing wrong with it.

673
00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:47.200
It's fun.
But it's the honest living,
the idea of everybody getting a say.

674
00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:48.070
And,
and,

675
00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:53.070
and what is good and what is bad is in new thing and some brand new people

676
00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:58.450
shouldn't get a duck.
A fucking say,
you know,

677
00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:03.640
variation Ernie Kumi of you and I appreciate that.
It's my life's goal.

678
00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:07.750
No offense to do the OB Anthony show shallow goal,

679
00:41:07.751 --> 00:41:10.450
but it's my entire life's goal to do.
Tell you what,
man,

680
00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:12.220
if you want to fly out there,

681
00:41:12.221 --> 00:41:15.550
I'm going to do it next time the UFC is in New Jersey real estate.

682
00:41:15.551 --> 00:41:18.970
You want to bring me all weekend?
I go mandate and Opie and Anthony,

683
00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:22.190
you're coming with me,
man.
I'll introduce you to those guys.
They would love you.

684
00:41:22.191 --> 00:41:25.540
You would love them too.
That's the back to his car though.

685
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:29.000
That's part of the Aston Martin.

686
00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:34.040
Anthony has a crazy Shelby Mustang and he was like 800 horsepower.

687
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:37.120
Fucking wrecked it.
Dude.
I don't know why I fucking die or

688
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:41.840
no comment.
Your honor is involved in that scenario.

689
00:41:41.841 --> 00:41:46.430
So it was just simply a Roomba.
I said,
do well on that sheet.
Yeah.
Yeah,

690
00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:50.480
he'd be perfect once they made fun of me.
Oh really?
Yeah.
I called them once.

691
00:41:50.481 --> 00:41:52.610
They made fun of me and they,
and,
and rightfully so.

692
00:41:52.611 --> 00:41:57.550
I called him with a fucking Douchey.
Has Shit ever.
How old were you?
22 Oh,
okay.

693
00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:04.790
Each badge of honor.
You make fun of each other.
I to be an Anthony are fine man.

694
00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:08.360
The first show that I ever did where I kind of learned that you didn't have to

695
00:42:08.361 --> 00:42:11.810
really structure anything.
You could just go have fun free for those guys.

696
00:42:11.811 --> 00:42:15.710
They have comics on,
they would have like Patrice,
Louis,
c,
k me,
you know,

697
00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:19.040
whoever that anybody would come in and has to.
Jim Norton of course.

698
00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:22.250
And everybody would just start talking and it was just a conversation amongst

699
00:42:22.251 --> 00:42:24.680
friends and if you tried to get like sticky with them,

700
00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:27.500
you tried to like throw in your bids the fuck she call you on it,

701
00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:29.030
they shut you down.

702
00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:35.300
It's just like friends fucking talking.
Danny rose,

703
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:39.590
Howard Stern for sure.
For sure.
We owe him the greatest dead.

704
00:42:39.591 --> 00:42:44.591
He's the the original pioneer of like that kind of free wild radio in my

705
00:42:44.991 --> 00:42:49.340
opinion.
But then opie and Anthony brought it to a different place because they,

706
00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:53.630
they had more of a hang,
their show was like a 40 hour plus five hour,

707
00:42:53.631 --> 00:42:56.970
whatever it was hanged.
Yeah.
It was a big shuffle in and out now.

708
00:42:57.050 --> 00:43:02.050
And I would stay on while other guests came on to Ed Asner came on once and they

709
00:43:02.391 --> 00:43:06.380
go,
come on,
it's hang on,
show had asthma come in and you know,

710
00:43:06.381 --> 00:43:08.510
not to talk when Ed's talking and you know,

711
00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:12.290
let them discuss things that he wants to discuss it.
But it's like,
it's a hang,

712
00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:14.690
it's like you get a chance to sit down with fucking,

713
00:43:14.691 --> 00:43:18.260
you're chilling with a bunch of people's mark when he's Mary Tyler Moore's boss.

714
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:22.030
Oh.
Um,
he had a show.
I remember we went from William Mary,

715
00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:25.370
Tom Morris boss to like be in like serious,
had like a serious show.

716
00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:29.420
We was the same characters and everybody was like,
what the fuck is this?

717
00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:33.680
Cause he was Mary Tyler Moore's boss.
Right.
Come back Kotter.
I know who you mean,

718
00:43:33.681 --> 00:43:36.440
but I can't think of his name.
I'm not old enough.
I don't think so.

719
00:43:36.441 --> 00:43:38.720
I remember Ed Asner,
he was still around.

720
00:43:38.721 --> 00:43:41.620
It's still hilarious and as an her Mary Tyler Moore's boss.
Yeah,

721
00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.390
he was and did the Marion charm or show.

722
00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:48.710
It was a new branching was about a newsroom and I am going to be this way

723
00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:49.970
because if we can think of,

724
00:43:49.971 --> 00:43:52.910
it was weird because it was like all the sudden it was a series show.

725
00:43:52.911 --> 00:43:57.110
We're very comedy show.
Exactly.
It was a really serious show.

726
00:43:57.111 --> 00:44:00.740
Was kind of like the Washington Post or the New York Times.
It was all drama.

727
00:44:00.741 --> 00:44:04.490
It was before Aaron Sorkin.
Yeah.
It was better than the newsroom.

728
00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:06.090
It was really weird though.

729
00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:10.640
It was like all of the sudden this guy knows from being on this hilarious
comedy,

730
00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:14.450
the Korean same characters like,
well,
I've got dark.

731
00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:19.450
The curmudgeon leading news guy at one point I grant grant.

732
00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:23.360
That's it.
At one point in time he was playing for his show.

733
00:44:23.361 --> 00:44:24.950
Looks depressing as fuck.
Yo.

734
00:44:24.970 --> 00:44:29.630
This show really does show is depressing and it was not just depressing.

735
00:44:29.631 --> 00:44:32.730
It was weird.
Yeah.
Looks the pressing.
Doesn't that look depressing?
Yeah.

736
00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:35.130
I Miss Ted.
I Miss Ted Baxter.
The anchorman.

737
00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:38.700
It was weird because it was the shift from the original show,

738
00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:43.260
which was completely comedy based to all of a sudden this guy's depressed as

739
00:44:43.261 --> 00:44:46.250
fuck.
Right.
Every episode is like someone's trying to kill somebody.

740
00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:51.630
And by the way,
is that Livia Soprano?
That's Tony Soprano's mother,
isn't it?

741
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:54.510
That's Livia.
Oh my God.

742
00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:57.320
Look at that for a spot that she looks like she's six foot tall.

743
00:44:57.340 --> 00:45:01.080
That fucking picture.
You're dead correct.
Look at you.
You got a thing for her.

744
00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:05.250
That shit I can pull see list actors out my ace.

745
00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:09.550
I love people to know pop culture.
It's like,

746
00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:12.330
I hate to go into a meeting and a reference something and then I feel like that

747
00:45:12.331 --> 00:45:15.780
old guy talking about shit,
nobody knows anything about bad cops.

748
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:18.840
Fucking Ed Asner.
Yeah,
exactly.

749
00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:21.420
Bad Cop shows or one of my favorite things of all time.

750
00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:25.200
So much so that there was a show called Delavan tour.
I remember the name.

751
00:45:25.201 --> 00:45:29.870
And then my manager also manages Kevin James,
who's a the king and queen.
Right.

752
00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:34.590
And they were on the same network as Danny Aiello when he had this show called

753
00:45:34.591 --> 00:45:39.240
Della Ventura.
And they had them get me the tapes because you couldn't find them.

754
00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:44.420
I have the original master.
Yes,
VHS tapes.

755
00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:49.860
Great show.
It's horrible and awesome at the same time.
I cherish these tapes.

756
00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:52.770
I have people over for Delavan tour watching parties.

757
00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:58.350
You bumped them over to a digital.
I have to do that.
I'm sorry.

758
00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:02.760
It's so bad.
It's so awesome.
You only get so many runs on the tape,
so you gotta.

759
00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:07.680
You gotta transfer that show.
I haven't watched them in years.
I can.

760
00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:09.960
I have them like in a sacred spot,

761
00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:12.810
have candles around them and make sure I keep them safe.

762
00:46:12.811 --> 00:46:17.310
I thought it'd be a really good idea to buy first season,
macgyver DVD box set.

763
00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:21.630
I was like,
fuck it.
Let me tell you about my grammar.

764
00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:26.730
Macgyver is infinitely better than Dylan.
I mean,
it's not measurable.

765
00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:31.230
Delavan Tory is one of the worst shows the world has ever known,

766
00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:32.190
but that's where we are.

767
00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:36.900
An old man beats up every young punk that crosses his eye.

768
00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:39.440
He's the best at everything he does.

769
00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:44.550
The Grand Torino fucking you will drown in Danny Aiello is ego.

770
00:46:44.551 --> 00:46:48.330
You will a juror round.
You will never make it out alive.

771
00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:53.490
Good and do the right thing so well,
he's an amazing listener.
No bullshit.

772
00:46:53.491 --> 00:46:56.700
I don't know who made the script.
I don't know what the fuck happened.
My show.

773
00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:00.450
I'm talking my shit.
I'm talking shit.
Maybe Danny thought it was a subtle comedy,

774
00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:04.500
but he's an amazing actor.
There's no,
you can't take that away from them.
The Guy,

775
00:47:04.501 --> 00:47:07.990
he's an incredible actor and so of course he has a bit of an ego.
He's,
he's,

776
00:47:07.991 --> 00:47:12.000
he's fucking bad ass.
He's a bad ass actor.
But still,
that show was so bad.

777
00:47:12.001 --> 00:47:16.860
It hurt your feelings.
It was so bad you would watch me go,

778
00:47:16.861 --> 00:47:21.570
Holy Shit.
Like he plays pool.
He plays pool with this guy,

779
00:47:21.571 --> 00:47:24.690
this young punk,
and he fucking shoots in every ball and the guy goes,

780
00:47:24.691 --> 00:47:28.680
you're the best I've ever seen.
Mr. What's your secret?
He goes,
my secret,

781
00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:29.890
don't miss

782
00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:34.840
<v 2>the best,
worst show ever.</v>

783
00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:40.430
You feel this fall in a fetal position and and break your own fingers because

784
00:47:40.751 --> 00:47:43.390
you squeezing them so tightly,
so embarrassed for him.

785
00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:47.140
Let me tell you what the first,
how many episodes?
I don't know.
I don't know.

786
00:47:47.141 --> 00:47:49.650
This had two seasons I think.
I think it went to see,

787
00:47:49.651 --> 00:47:51.460
they might've been just one season.
I'm not sure.

788
00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:55.510
I have a nice box of 'em the first season of macgyver it to watch it.

789
00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:59.770
Three quarters voiceover.
Oh,
random jungle shots.

790
00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:04.120
Like helicopter over the jug with like,
and then I broke him out of prison.

791
00:48:04.121 --> 00:48:08.080
It's like him.
No way are you got shots and then it's like next voiceover.

792
00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:12.220
It's the most bullshit thing.
It really,
that bad.

793
00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:15.910
They could have shot the entire season and about four days they probably did.

794
00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:22.930
It was cheap.
Fucking Richard Dean Anderson in the booth.
He was not in target.

795
00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:25.810
That's hilarious.
That's hilarious.

796
00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:31.110
Those old fucking old crime shows cop and crime shows are so awesome.

797
00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:34.780
Well,
iron side,
you remember a guy in a wheelchair,

798
00:48:34.781 --> 00:48:37.810
they're remaking iron side for NBC.
Oh my God.

799
00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:42.590
They are with Blair Underwood as the,
uh,
as the guy who's Blair Underwood.

800
00:48:42.591 --> 00:48:45.460
But I know that I'm supposed to African American actor.
He was in a,

801
00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:49.300
an NBC show last season where he's the president and there's this other

802
00:48:49.301 --> 00:48:53.160
dimension or people from another word though.
They're aliens.
Actually it was,
uh,

803
00:48:53.410 --> 00:48:57.490
it was actually a really cool show you've been on.
NBC made it sound terrible.

804
00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:01.280
It made one season.
I'm still thinking about Delavan Torah.
I'm sorry.
Yeah,
focus.

805
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:04.500
Would you rather you want to call it?
Call it early and go elements.

806
00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:09.590
It's just,
it was such a great show.

807
00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:12.280
It's such a great show for all the wrong reasons.
Yeah,
that sounds awesome.

808
00:49:12.281 --> 00:49:16.810
It's like the $6 million man.
Do you do a like a back to back?
No.
$6 million man.

809
00:49:16.811 --> 00:49:21.710
Was it from a different era?
You know,
it wasn't as,
it wasn't as groovy.
Okay.
You,

810
00:49:22.050 --> 00:49:25.720
you gotta jump to you.
How fucking old are you?
45 see you got,

811
00:49:25.721 --> 00:49:28.390
do you have 14 years old?
You homie?
Yeah.

812
00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:32.290
And we are trying to tell a vendor references.
Yes.
What you young I liked,

813
00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:35.020
I liked being bald.
It makes me feel like I'm the old motherfucker.

814
00:49:35.021 --> 00:49:39.490
You older than Todd?
He's the oldest.
He knows.
No,
no.
Say it would be a very weird,

815
00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:45.160
I'm much older,
like Tanner Foust,
almost as old as Joe and looks like a child.

816
00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:48.790
Yeah,
he's very baby faced.
He's,
you know,
he does is,

817
00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:54.010
that's what happened.
We just went,
well,
maybe driving that fast.

818
00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:58.510
She just numb your nerves.
Heim is different.
I know.
I know.

819
00:49:58.511 --> 00:49:59.380
Bob Bonderant,

820
00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:03.910
you know Bob Onder on his blog or on school of high performance driving penis on

821
00:50:03.911 --> 00:50:06.760
a great track and Phoenix,
the guy was like,

822
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:11.790
he drove around with m four gts back fucking the 24 hours of Lamont in a Shelby

823
00:50:14.350 --> 00:50:18.940
Cobra.
That's how bad ass he is.
He,
he won the gnarliest race in the world,

824
00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:21.790
in the scariest car ever made.
That's all you need to know.

825
00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:24.760
But he took on every driver on the plan.

826
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:29.330
Like Americans in those days weren't winning on all these international

827
00:50:29.331 --> 00:50:31.760
circuits.
The Europeans kicked our ass all the time.

828
00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:36.430
And then Enzo Ferrari was like shitting in our mouths on a weekly basis.
Exactly.

829
00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:41.570
Phil Hill came along and Bob Bonderant [inaudible],

830
00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:44.540
Carol Shelby,
it was went on just smash.

831
00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:46.970
Kind of bizarre because in those days in America,

832
00:50:46.971 --> 00:50:51.200
like road racing wasn't the same thing like it was way below football,
baseball,

833
00:50:51.201 --> 00:50:51.680
basketball.

834
00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:55.850
So I used bond odds track in Arizona sometimes and he's 78 years old and he's

835
00:50:55.851 --> 00:51:00.380
there every day and he has a much younger,
very lovely wife.

836
00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:04.670
She's pat is Mark Patterson,

837
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:06.620
great brains behind the whole thing.

838
00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:10.550
He didn't have his name on the car and she's a marketing agency and so she,

839
00:51:10.551 --> 00:51:13.430
you know,
he's 88 and I go out with heart and bless his heart.

840
00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:16.730
How old is she in her fifties and I'll go,

841
00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:20.570
I'll go out with him in a corvette.
Zr 178 years old will,

842
00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:25.460
oh I do eight labs every day to keep my reflexes sharp.

843
00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:29.030
And you go,
as you're getting in the car and you go and you go,
oh my God,
this is,

844
00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:30.020
this is the end.

845
00:51:30.021 --> 00:51:33.890
It's going to say Paul Baran and one identify unidentified other person died

846
00:51:33.891 --> 00:51:38.000
today and then he goes like hug sitting sideways.

847
00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:39.990
He can drive.
Like,

848
00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:45.200
imagine you go with your grandfather and having him drift the whole track.

849
00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:49.820
Like so scared
in the car and go like,

850
00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:54.260
I'm wearing a helmet.
I'm strapped in five point harness,
I've got a Hans device,

851
00:51:54.261 --> 00:51:58.580
there's a roll cage.
I'll be fine.
My grandfather before he went,

852
00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:01.600
and that's his wife on the right sign,

853
00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:05.480
looks thrilled and that picture,
he's very happy.

854
00:52:05.481 --> 00:52:10.481
Why should he not be blessed as long as Viagara exists?

855
00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:14.940
We're all good.
Fucking,
he's great,
man.
Thank you for that time Bob.

856
00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:18.050
And she's smart.
Yeah.
Beautiful.
I love it when people,

857
00:52:18.051 --> 00:52:23.051
when exactly life wins wins.

858
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:27.130
He's a sweetheart.
He's having fun wounds.
Use Food.

859
00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:32.990
Youtube comments are number four,
six,
five,
six,
five,
six,
two,
nine,
eight.

860
00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:36.880
Yeah.
Well,
it's just,
it's unfortunate.
Yup.
There's,

861
00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:40.250
there's people out there that I have so much horrifying,

862
00:52:41.830 --> 00:52:46.040
are fucking culture sets a really terrible precedent based on the people that

863
00:52:46.041 --> 00:52:49.540
appear on the front page as a fucking TMZ dude.
It certainly does.

864
00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:55.220
The set,
isn't it?
Well,
I think we're fascinating,
fascinating and really stupid.

865
00:52:55.221 --> 00:52:58.670
People are fascinating and undeniable ways,
even as smart folks,

866
00:52:58.910 --> 00:53:02.360
and you're obsessed with Farrah.
Abraham because she is so out of touch.

867
00:53:02.361 --> 00:53:04.970
Who's that?
I don't know who that is.
That teen mom,
Dad,

868
00:53:04.971 --> 00:53:08.810
I made it very obvious anal porno and it's like,
oh no,

869
00:53:08.811 --> 00:53:12.920
we were dating and it leaked and it's,
you know,
oh,

870
00:53:12.921 --> 00:53:17.270
but you got $1 million.
You know,
really young people,

871
00:53:17.271 --> 00:53:19.970
they get thrust into the camera like that.

872
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.230
I can't imagine the kind of pressure and especially if you don't necessarily

873
00:53:24.231 --> 00:53:25.580
have your shit and all this

874
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:29.430
<v 0>teen mom show and you have to provide for your child and this is like a lot of</v>

875
00:53:29.431 --> 00:53:33.300
weirdness to that too.
When I was in high school,
that kind of television,

876
00:53:33.301 --> 00:53:35.470
some of it he didn't.
In certain ways it,
it's,

877
00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:40.640
it's almost impossible at for to not be right because it's impossible for you to

878
00:53:40.771 --> 00:53:44.160
be a teenager and to be able to make up your mind whether or not you want the

879
00:53:44.161 --> 00:53:46.500
whole world to be able to see you for the rest of your life.

880
00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:49.710
I don't think even understand what you're doing.
They're not thinking through it.

881
00:53:49.711 --> 00:53:51.600
Their parents,
let me just rephrase that.

882
00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:54.240
I don't think I would have understood what I was doing.
Right.

883
00:53:54.241 --> 00:53:57.180
I know I wouldn't have understood what I was doing and I wouldn't have wanted

884
00:53:57.181 --> 00:54:00.870
that on television.
Right.
I know that ever.
But that's me.

885
00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:04.560
I mean maybe some people don't care and it's not that big of a deal and it
helps.

886
00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:06.940
It gives them money and it helps them get through.

887
00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:10.560
Helps me and I kind of get that it can provide for him.
But,

888
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:15.240
but fame was fame the end game for you because fame is the end game for them?

889
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:17.440
Yeah.
Well it's not,
I don't know if it's the end game.

890
00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:21.480
The only game they've got to play all day.
All that matters is the fame.

891
00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:24.270
It's the only game they've got to play.
Do you know what I'm saying?

892
00:54:24.271 --> 00:54:26.370
It's like there's meth heads and fucking Alabama.

893
00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:30.780
The amount of reaction they can get from fame is so much greater than the amount

894
00:54:30.781 --> 00:54:35.010
of reaction that they can get from getting really good at a craft or really good

895
00:54:35.011 --> 00:54:37.030
at an occupation are really good at,
you know,

896
00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:42.210
becoming rising to the top of their field or suck a lot of Cox in a reality show

897
00:54:42.211 --> 00:54:45.660
and drink whiskey through a funnel that's connected to your asshole and you're

898
00:54:45.661 --> 00:54:46.560
the life of the party.

899
00:54:46.770 --> 00:54:49.350
And then all of a sudden everybody wants to know you and you're going to be at

900
00:54:49.351 --> 00:54:54.180
the fucking club opening in Vegas.
You know?
I mean,
that's really how we rocket.

901
00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:56.490
Yeah.
And so you know,
you look at you like,

902
00:54:56.491 --> 00:55:00.420
why did I get a phd and this motherfucker makes $1 million a year on Jersey

903
00:55:00.421 --> 00:55:02.520
shore.
What's happening?
I ran,

904
00:55:02.521 --> 00:55:06.210
happened for Lacey at the fucking Hollywood Roosevelt and asked him if it was,

905
00:55:06.211 --> 00:55:10.070
you know,
he is who's at the fat guy from Jackass.
Oh,
okay.
Hey guys,

906
00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:13.040
the token fat guy.
What happened to him?
I,
you know,

907
00:55:13.050 --> 00:55:16.200
he would do horrible things for 5000.0 my God,
they did.

908
00:55:16.201 --> 00:55:19.590
I ask you things like that and I would ask him,
I,
the first thing I says,
dude,

909
00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:24.520
was it worth it?
And he goes,
no,
just as straight as a fucking air.

910
00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:25.320
No.

911
00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:29.880
Well those jackass guys with with day to a lot of like stuff that can get you

912
00:55:29.881 --> 00:55:32.920
really,
really hurt.
You know?
And I know that

913
00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:38.080
Joe Rogan,
but there's some things like Johnny,
what's his face?

914
00:55:38.090 --> 00:55:41.130
Not Johnny Knoxville.
After he became famous,
after we did movies,

915
00:55:41.490 --> 00:55:46.180
Johnny Knoxville stood right in front of a bull and let that pull launching in.

916
00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:49.620
I put a blindfold on,
he was already in front of the book.
He was already rich.

917
00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:54.700
He was already a movie star that's doing legitimate dukes of Hazzard and fucking

918
00:55:55.191 --> 00:55:58.410
had a bull charge him in the chest.
So fucking crazy.

919
00:55:58.411 --> 00:56:03.411
And he's a dad and he's like 40 he was trying to be letting these euro's launch

920
00:56:03.751 --> 00:56:06.000
them through the air.
Yeah,
I was trying to like keep with it,

921
00:56:06.210 --> 00:56:09.360
but it's such a good idea.
The idea.
What if Johnny Knoxville,

922
00:56:09.361 --> 00:56:11.430
it's like fucking Jagger.

923
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:15.960
He's like 50 get kicked in the nuts.
Oh my God.

924
00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:18.780
Mick Jagger's.
Another weird thing though,
God,
I don't,

925
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:22.800
I don't want to go pay to see Mick Jagger perform.
Why?

926
00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:24.100
Because he's so

927
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:24.933
<v 2>old.</v>

928
00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:29.960
It's like rock and roll is not not to be performed by old people.

929
00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:35.180
I not like I'll listen to old rolling stones is brilliant.

930
00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:38.050
Some of them in the 60s your effort,

931
00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:41.150
but I'm not going to go to staples center and watch the rolling.

932
00:56:41.170 --> 00:56:43.450
Where's the cut off?
Just not got off.

933
00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:48.070
The cutoff is just when it feels weird because I just got two nights of Pearl

934
00:56:48.070 --> 00:56:52.210
Jam in November.
I'm fucking site.
That's a low brow.

935
00:56:52.211 --> 00:56:56.050
Within the parameter was in parameters.
I don't agree with Todd.

936
00:56:56.110 --> 00:56:59.350
I don't agree with Todd.
Go See Mick Jagger at staples.
Without a doubt.

937
00:56:59.510 --> 00:57:00.910
It's the only thing that I would do.

938
00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:03.340
The only reason why I would not is the parking.

939
00:57:05.290 --> 00:57:08.140
That would be my concern.
If somebody could tell him.
I know.
Yeah.

940
00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:12.220
My concern would be parking here at if I could eat fucking getting out of this

941
00:57:12.221 --> 00:57:15.130
things.
It's such a pain that dick man,
those giant line fucking,

942
00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:17.110
I'll use the subway.

943
00:57:17.111 --> 00:57:21.790
Joe Take the metro to do that [inaudible] center.
I'm not kidding.

944
00:57:21.791 --> 00:57:24.240
Like driving places like parking lots,

945
00:57:24.241 --> 00:57:27.240
your gt three but this motherfucker,

946
00:57:27.250 --> 00:57:29.290
this this old lady looking dude.

947
00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:36.190
It can't be,
it's probably not even a real pictures.
It's probably a wax figure.

948
00:57:36.191 --> 00:57:38.580
They got hit with a fucking lighter.
That liberty.

949
00:57:38.581 --> 00:57:41.400
He was skydiving and they took his face and put it him.

950
00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:46.950
That's not Jeremy Clarkson in an aerial Adam and mister car guy.
No,

951
00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:48.310
that it's,
it's just,

952
00:57:48.311 --> 00:57:51.880
it's like that Old Lady in Playboy magazine that grandmother naked that would

953
00:57:51.881 --> 00:57:53.800
open the door with her tits touching the ground.

954
00:57:53.830 --> 00:57:58.240
It's just weird to hear Mick Jagger playing.
I can't get no satisfaction

955
00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:04.600
talking about how that playboy,
I want to see that guy.
That's a cartoon.

956
00:58:04.601 --> 00:58:08.740
Not a real,
I don't want us to want to see that guy before he expired.

957
00:58:09.050 --> 00:58:12.700
He said historical figure and it's a nostalgia thing,

958
00:58:12.701 --> 00:58:16.450
but it's not a historical figure in rock and roll for sure.

959
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:20.950
Like real.
The real band is behind the fucking stage playing the song.

960
00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:25.180
No,
I do not even that.

961
00:58:25.181 --> 00:58:28.180
I wouldn't fucking type shit.

962
00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:33.370
Grassy knoll type shit.
Slam it on the rain.
I don't know.

963
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:37.630
Mick Jagger sounded like backstage.
I can't imagine that would be true.

964
00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:41.980
I can't imagine that they would allow that.
I agree.
But here's the thing.
I,

965
00:58:42.610 --> 00:58:43.840
I grew up on the east coast.

966
00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:49.560
I saw Bruce Springsteen in an outdoor concert with 2000 people before born to

967
00:58:50.501 --> 00:58:54.280
run.
We listened to him on the radio all the time.
Wow.
That must have been wild.

968
00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:58.880
If slower born to run.
That's how old I am.

969
00:58:58.940 --> 00:59:03.940
This is just like 1973 Nice God in Rock Creek Park and Washington DC is no

970
00:59:06.191 --> 00:59:06.731
denying.

971
00:59:06.731 --> 00:59:11.500
Did Bruce Springsteen was and is still a bad motherfucker then staples center?

972
00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:14.140
No,
no.
He is.
He's still is.

973
00:59:14.141 --> 00:59:18.790
But then as it as it as a performance space,

974
00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:22.040
they opened staples center.
All my buddies,
like we

975
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:24.230
<v 0>got to go see Springsteen staples centers opening.</v>

976
00:59:24.231 --> 00:59:26.330
We got all these special tickets.
We went to see him.

977
00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:31.610
It's socked and he played his heart out.
It wasn't his fault.
Whose fault was it?

978
00:59:31.611 --> 00:59:36.090
The acoustic suck.
Oh Wow.
They fixed,
let's hope so.
Yeah,

979
00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:39.040
a little bit.
But he's,
he says suck.

980
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:43.690
I just mean it was loud and crowded.
Oh,
he means it was a concert.

981
00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:50.260
You meaning it sucked as an experience for you.
Correct.
Okay.

982
00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:55.970
Bruce Bruce is Bruce.
Bruce will always be the boss.
He's like,

983
00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:58.990
he's amazing.
He's unbelievable.
He's drunk.
He's going change.

984
00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:04.490
He's drugs full wavering in and out like I am with Janea,
yellow Russian.

985
01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:07.550
I can drink.
By the way,
Danny,
if you listen to this,

986
01:00:07.610 --> 01:00:11.270
I'm just fucking around your brilliant actor and it's just a joke.

987
01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:16.490
I've done bad TV shows too.
It's all good,
homie.
Aye,
you very much Danny.

988
01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:19.100
Aiello much respect.
You're a bad mother fucker.
As an actor,

989
01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:24.080
how do you come back from a bad TV show?
Well,
it's hard to get a hit TV show now.

990
01:00:24.081 --> 01:00:26.510
If someone puts them on something with some really good writing.
I mean,

991
01:00:26.610 --> 01:00:29.870
we looked at the bottom line with actors is if you don't give them something

992
01:00:29.871 --> 01:00:32.300
good to sink their teeth into,
they never going to have a good show.

993
01:00:32.301 --> 01:00:36.170
It's impossible.
No one actor personality.

994
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:39.020
I've done some acting,
but when I did it,

995
01:00:39.021 --> 01:00:41.900
I only did it because I couldn't believe that anybody who's going to put me on

996
01:00:41.901 --> 01:00:44.180
television because it was never anything.
I planned it out.

997
01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:48.770
What did you actually act in?
You acted it was on us.
I was on two sitcoms.
Um,

998
01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:52.280
one of them's called hardballs,
a baseball show.
That was terrible.

999
01:00:52.281 --> 01:00:55.630
And then another one was called news radio and that was for a news radio's

1000
01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.010
that's a real,
she was radio.
That was a real shock man.
Yeah,

1001
01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:01.230
it was on for five years.
And then after I did that,
I was like,
okay,
that's,

1002
01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:02.270
that's it with actors.

1003
01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:06.020
And I did only acted with Kevin James and a couple of movies,

1004
01:01:06.021 --> 01:01:10.190
but just Kevin's my buddy,
you know,
he's good.
He's probably fun,
I guess.

1005
01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:13.970
Kevin James,
a great guy,
man.
He's a great guy.
He's a funny motherfucker.

1006
01:01:14.450 --> 01:01:19.450
He's a funny motherfucker.
Matt,
Matt's equivocating here.
He's got this,

1007
01:01:19.451 --> 01:01:24.020
some Kevin James has.
It's like family environment that he's entertaining in.

1008
01:01:24.050 --> 01:01:27.980
You know what I mean?
He's in,
well,
let me tell you something.

1009
01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:32.960
It's not an Adam Sandler Sandler go to his house and you go,
oh,

1010
01:01:32.961 --> 01:01:34.250
okay,
well yeah,

1011
01:01:34.251 --> 01:01:38.210
you make it a lot of money to fucking like Bob Saget it up a little bit.

1012
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:41.360
But the thing is about Kevin,
what I know for Real,
he,

1013
01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:44.080
he likes doing those movies.
Yeah,
he really does.
Like,

1014
01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:47.290
he seems like a guy with a big heart.
He's a very big sweetheart.

1015
01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:49.520
He's a sweetheart.
I mean bone in his body.

1016
01:01:49.830 --> 01:01:52.940
He likes to make movies to entertain his own kid.
Absolutely.

1017
01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:56.750
But he's always been like fairly,
he was always really clean.

1018
01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:59.840
He wasn't married,
he was unknown.
He was always really clean.

1019
01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:03.050
We were always good buddies,
but our comedy was always very different.

1020
01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:05.360
But he's just,
he's a funny fucking dude.

1021
01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:10.220
His standup comedy was Kevin James.
Standup comedy was,
I'm telling you,

1022
01:02:10.221 --> 01:02:15.221
I've laughed harder watching him and very few people in my life being in,

1023
01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:19.100
being his buddy.
That's fine.
We don't do gigs.
Is it worth watching?
It's hard.

1024
01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:24.060
Like the stuff that he does now.
I'm like,
uh,
I think,

1025
01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:26.670
I don't know if he's,
if he's done a special on a while,

1026
01:02:26.671 --> 01:02:30.570
I'm sure he has something.
But when,
when I was,
when I was friends with him,

1027
01:02:30.571 --> 01:02:33.330
it's like he was coming up and he would,
when Kevin goes crazy,

1028
01:02:33.331 --> 01:02:36.410
like when he would go like get really angry,
something,

1029
01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:38.130
he had this bit about Poland,

1030
01:02:38.131 --> 01:02:42.900
his girl pull his car up to where his girlfriend was and she goes to grab the

1031
01:02:42.901 --> 01:02:46.890
door handle before it unlocks it and it cancels it out and he can't get her to

1032
01:02:46.891 --> 01:02:50.900
let go and he fucking screaming.
He gets red in the face,

1033
01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:53.820
they cancel each other out.

1034
01:02:53.821 --> 01:02:56.430
Could y'all could talk over and over again and he gets fucking crazy.

1035
01:02:56.610 --> 01:03:01.020
I don't want even paraphrase the big cause it's so funny picture and Kevin James

1036
01:03:01.030 --> 01:03:04.920
His face getting redder and angry and actually it's funny,
it goes crazy.

1037
01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:09.990
We had a lot of fun together.
We did.
Kevin and I will always be friends.

1038
01:03:09.991 --> 01:03:11.490
We did a lot of gigs together,

1039
01:03:11.491 --> 01:03:15.210
like coming up when we were both essentially like our first couple of years of

1040
01:03:15.211 --> 01:03:17.850
actually being professionals.
We were both like pal around together.

1041
01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:20.490
How many cities would you tour when you did that?

1042
01:03:20.491 --> 01:03:24.930
It's just like 10 or or depend like most of the time when I was east coast
based,

1043
01:03:24.931 --> 01:03:27.590
I stuck on the east coast because that's where I lived and I didn't do,

1044
01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:31.950
the only time I did a road gigs was I would get flown into like these really

1045
01:03:31.951 --> 01:03:35.130
shitty shitty colleges and like Olivet,
Michigan,

1046
01:03:35.370 --> 01:03:37.650
we would fly on a propeller plane.

1047
01:03:38.790 --> 01:03:40.490
I didn't know where to tell you.

1048
01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:43.950
It was a private plane and then told you that you had three stopovers.

1049
01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:46.650
They would give you off the mail.

1050
01:03:46.651 --> 01:03:50.850
A couple of chickens and I would get a rental car and I would have to drive to

1051
01:03:50.851 --> 01:03:54.630
the location and I had,
I had a map.
Oh,
okay.

1052
01:03:54.631 --> 01:03:58.080
There was no navigation systems back then and the injections that gave you were

1053
01:03:58.081 --> 01:04:03.010
always wrong.
Siri,
who shall we?
So some weird motherfucker in the middle.

1054
01:04:03.150 --> 01:04:03.731
Yeah.
I've,

1055
01:04:03.731 --> 01:04:07.830
I've had some crazy experiences like who do you like to see if you can go see,

1056
01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:12.210
see what I like to see.
There's so many people now.

1057
01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:16.050
This is like one of the best times ever.
Really good time for comedy.
Stand up.

1058
01:04:16.051 --> 01:04:19.170
Your Buddy Brian was hilarious.
Callen yeah,

1059
01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:23.640
we want to see Bryan County,
Washington.
He was awesome.
He was hilarious.

1060
01:04:24.030 --> 01:04:28.180
We landed early and Joe says,
you want to go see this show?
I think fuck yes,

1061
01:04:28.290 --> 01:04:32.730
let's go.
Chris Porter.
No,
he's fucking great.

1062
01:04:32.731 --> 01:04:36.980
I just saw,
I just saw him at the comedy store in California.

1063
01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:40.470
There's a lot of really funny guys now.

1064
01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:43.680
It's getting better and better like all the time.
It's very exciting.

1065
01:04:43.830 --> 01:04:48.530
I have all these in Florida.
I was fucking,
my friend gave me a,

1066
01:04:48.531 --> 01:04:52.230
a murse like immerse a Lamborghini mercy ago and I thought you meant like a man

1067
01:04:52.231 --> 01:04:55.980
purse.
I was going to bond with you like my fanny pack.

1068
01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.830
You've got to put those up on [inaudible].

1069
01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:01.590
They'll go wear a fanny pack all day Sun.

1070
01:05:01.591 --> 01:05:04.230
You'll Goldberg Rock switchback blowing up.

1071
01:05:04.290 --> 01:05:08.490
I have no problem admitting I wear a fanny pack blowing up last week on the
show,

1072
01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:11.370
on the show,
I wore a fanny pack when I went out squatch and,
and um,

1073
01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:15.270
I should have pointed out that I have a swatch,
sweet fanny pack squashes.

1074
01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:17.410
When you go looking for bigfoot Sasquatch,

1075
01:05:17.470 --> 01:05:20.260
they call it squatch and you would actually,

1076
01:05:20.290 --> 01:05:23.930
I'm actually in the know that's watching Jesus watching for the teeth.

1077
01:05:24.310 --> 01:05:28.200
<v 2>Joe's gone squats and Matt,
we came really close to mean finding bigfoot.</v>

1078
01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:31.630
Yeah.
While you were questioning everything,

1079
01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:33.810
were you questioning squatch is that yes.
Yeah.

1080
01:05:33.850 --> 01:05:36.370
We went and I'll tell you really worth questioning.

1081
01:05:36.371 --> 01:05:39.290
I think we've pretty much established,
oh no,
we have,

1082
01:05:39.790 --> 01:05:43.450
<v 0>this is why it's known.
There's only one reason why it's worth question.</v>

1083
01:05:43.451 --> 01:05:46.690
The only one for me,
and that's that it used to be a real animal,
100%,

1084
01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:49.370
no doubt about it.
It was a gigantic kitchens animal,

1085
01:05:50.650 --> 01:05:54.130
but have no a hundred thousand years within the last hundred thousand years,

1086
01:05:54.131 --> 01:05:55.420
it was an eight to 10 foot tall,

1087
01:05:55.421 --> 01:06:00.340
gigantic primate looking thing that may or may not have been bipedal depending.

1088
01:06:00.341 --> 01:06:02.050
Apparently.
I said by people before,

1089
01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:05.350
but then some people on the rogue and board pointed out that that's actually in

1090
01:06:05.351 --> 01:06:07.120
dispute.
It's based on the shape of the jaw.

1091
01:06:07.121 --> 01:06:10.270
Apparently they believe that the draw is shaped in a way that indicates that

1092
01:06:10.271 --> 01:06:12.730
that thing stood up,
right.
Not like a shape of a gorilla,

1093
01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:15.560
right where it's over on,
on,
on fall forward.

1094
01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:18.130
None of those people who say they've seen it.

1095
01:06:18.131 --> 01:06:21.240
I've actually seen it and that's what I'm saying is that it was a real laugh.

1096
01:06:21.370 --> 01:06:24.790
It was a real animal that lived in the same area where people came from,

1097
01:06:24.791 --> 01:06:27.920
where people came on the Bering Strait lands shrimp,
the bank straight,

1098
01:06:28.690 --> 01:06:32.320
that's Asia and that's exactly what these gigantic picture there was a split and

1099
01:06:32.321 --> 01:06:36.790
some point in evolution is that they died off and most likely they died off.

1100
01:06:37.030 --> 01:06:40.660
Most likely.
There's nothing up there,
most likely people full of shit.

1101
01:06:40.661 --> 01:06:44.450
Most likely people see things in the dark,
most likely.
If you look at,
you know,

1102
01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:46.330
if you want to like outcomes,
raise the shit out of it,

1103
01:06:46.690 --> 01:06:51.690
but you have to wonder about this sheer mass of the Pacific northwest.

1104
01:06:52.031 --> 01:06:55.540
First of all,
if you fly over that thing,
it will make you shit your pants.

1105
01:06:55.930 --> 01:06:58.870
You can't believe how many fucking trees there are up there.
And you know,

1106
01:06:58.871 --> 01:07:01.810
no one's on there.
I'm going there tomorrow,
man.

1107
01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:03.920
Mallet marine near his fucking faggot.

1108
01:07:04.170 --> 01:07:06.960
<v 2>I'm driving by.
I'm doing 500 miles off road.</v>

1109
01:07:07.050 --> 01:07:11.130
I'm doing the Washington discovery,
uh,
Washington back under discovery.

1110
01:07:11.131 --> 01:07:15.200
We're doing 500 miles on dirt to what?
Diagonally across the state of war.

1111
01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:19.350
The guy pack just in case.
Give me the fanny pack.

1112
01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:22.870
He need a good solid camera man.
You can't be fucking with your iPhone.
Oh No,
no,

1113
01:07:22.871 --> 01:07:22.991
no.

1114
01:07:22.991 --> 01:07:27.991
Good solid 12 we're bringing like of course your film at Gopros or you got go

1115
01:07:29.130 --> 01:07:31.980
pros all over the county.
You get an h fucking amateur hour son.

1116
01:07:31.981 --> 01:07:33.160
We're way beyond Gopros.

1117
01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:38.370
Five d mark two and three mounts to a car fuck cab or over kill.

1118
01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:43.210
No proper cinematic quality out changeable lenses.
He geeked out on me.

1119
01:07:43.211 --> 01:07:47.740
You hurt my feelings.
This is why your camera's on cars.

1120
01:07:47.850 --> 01:07:49.860
You're making cable shows that I'm working on the Internet,

1121
01:07:49.861 --> 01:07:53.200
which is the future because I fucking shoot cars properly and networks

1122
01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:56.850
and the internet.
And the real question is,

1123
01:07:56.851 --> 01:07:59.340
now that I have Joe cornered on a fucking microphone,

1124
01:07:59.490 --> 01:08:01.890
can I make a film with your car?
Yeah,
yeah,

1125
01:08:01.891 --> 01:08:03.200
we could just something she had to film

1126
01:08:05.250 --> 01:08:08.470
because Shark Works [inaudible] car word.

1127
01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:14.180
It has to be fun car man.
Pick our road.
You know the race,
the road we talked.
No,

1128
01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:16.010
no,
no.
First of all ever say don't say it

1129
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:18.790
<v 1>on the air.
Never say it on the air.
Right.</v>

1130
01:08:18.930 --> 01:08:22.040
Well we'll take it to a track and have some fun with it.
That's what we fun car.

1131
01:08:22.250 --> 01:08:26.380
It's really fun.
It's glued to the ground too,
so it's so alive.
That card,

1132
01:08:26.381 --> 01:08:30.590
like it's so low driver though is daily.
Come on.

1133
01:08:31.130 --> 01:08:36.130
You don't have a fucking daily,
I have other cars,
but I have an m three a new,

1134
01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:40.700
a new one.
You know I got another one,
I had one and I got an a not a VA.
Yeah,

1135
01:08:40.701 --> 01:08:45.210
the same Da da,
but it's not the Turbo Charge v six right.
That's exactly,

1136
01:08:45.410 --> 01:08:49.370
that doesn't come out.
I got,
I got a new one because I loved it so much.

1137
01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:52.780
That's like a traffic car.
Those cars,
cars,

1138
01:08:53.530 --> 01:08:57.830
it's a perfectly balanced car.
It's fast as you ever needed to be.
It merges.

1139
01:08:57.831 --> 01:09:01.660
It does whatever you do.
If you're not driving like an asshole and it's,

1140
01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:05.840
I have a double comforts of my own ambition.
If you're in La,

1141
01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.070
you have an excuse

1142
01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:11.960
and we were like texting back and forth and you were saying that it was bombed

1143
01:09:11.961 --> 01:09:16.961
you out with the new gt three and the lack of paddle or a manual.

1144
01:09:17.090 --> 01:09:17.960
I won't buy it.
Well,

1145
01:09:17.961 --> 01:09:22.040
here's the problem is that you and your Porsche parked outside.

1146
01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:26.000
You have spent however long you've had that car,
daily driving,

1147
01:09:26.001 --> 01:09:30.350
v more most perfect manual transmission there is.
Okay,
so your car,

1148
01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:33.620
I drive a lot of cars that drive like 200 cars a year.

1149
01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:36.170
That's the best that stick gets.
Now.

1150
01:09:36.230 --> 01:09:39.860
The nine nine one with that seven speed they have,
it sucks.

1151
01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:45.200
I've heard that from the
paddles or a terrible shift.

1152
01:09:45.270 --> 01:09:47.090
I don't think there should be those two options.

1153
01:09:47.091 --> 01:09:51.260
Let's think there's six the shifter choice,
go back to the same kid.

1154
01:09:51.290 --> 01:09:53.480
Figure out how to fit that nine nine seven,

1155
01:09:53.481 --> 01:09:57.130
six speed manual gearbox and your stupid nine nine one or something and go fuck

1156
01:09:57.131 --> 01:09:59.720
yourself.
That's what they need to do.
Go back to a six Pete,

1157
01:09:59.721 --> 01:10:03.110
I don't need seven speed.
Stupid.
What am I trying to save pennies on gas mileage.

1158
01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:06.320
Stop being silly.
You know,
once you really want the neck transmissions,

1159
01:10:06.321 --> 01:10:09.050
you fuck got seven miles a gallon on my car.

1160
01:10:09.170 --> 01:10:13.100
The only way to get a step up from what you have right now is a tick your motor

1161
01:10:13.190 --> 01:10:16.430
and putting in a Cayman.
Oh yeah.
That's the fucking gate.

1162
01:10:16.431 --> 01:10:20.810
The four weeks game leader came in is the game over.
That's a game ender.

1163
01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:25.250
That's the Porsche had the balls to actually make that car.

1164
01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:27.750
It would be fucking tremendous.

1165
01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:32.060
Is No one who would buy nine 11 nine 11 to the end of the nine Olympia over to

1166
01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:35.470
shark works do that.
Will they take a a gt three engine and put it in a Cayman?

1167
01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:39.650
You know,
who else will it be?
Bi Autumn who I promised I would blog.
Yeah,

1168
01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:43.250
because the guys who made that,
uh,
was 85.
Is that what it was?

1169
01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:47.660
That's what I'm going to tell you.
It was almost brought it.
I almost brought it,

1170
01:10:47.661 --> 01:10:49.880
but I have to get on a flight at 9:00 AM tomorrow morning,

1171
01:10:49.881 --> 01:10:52.500
so I can't bring it back to Huntington.
Well,

1172
01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:57.280
we'll do another next time we do a podcast bringing it to my podcast.

1173
01:10:57.590 --> 01:11:02.440
I would love to,
but why don't they put a Sunroof in the Cayman?
Um,

1174
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:06.810
you could buy a Boxster which says no.
Why would you do that when you have a box?

1175
01:11:07.190 --> 01:11:10.550
I love the sun roof in my car.
I know you do,
but you know what man,

1176
01:11:10.551 --> 01:11:14.310
those buttons and those Boxster s ss,
they go back so fast.

1177
01:11:14.490 --> 01:11:18.990
It's like 13 seconds.
I don't want a convertible,
but you're in a car that's like,

1178
01:11:18.991 --> 01:11:23.450
it's boxed.
It's such a solid roadster.
I've been in fucking driving a Boxster.

1179
01:11:23.670 --> 01:11:26.480
They're great toy.
We,

1180
01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:28.770
we hit a weird error right now with cars.

1181
01:11:28.771 --> 01:11:31.920
And that the exponential increase of technology that applies to almost

1182
01:11:31.921 --> 01:11:34.200
everything in the world,
whether it's laptops or cell phones,

1183
01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:36.750
also applies to automobiles and horsepower.

1184
01:11:36.930 --> 01:11:39.810
And there's a point of diminishing returns,
right?
And in my opinion,

1185
01:11:39.811 --> 01:11:44.811
it seems to lie within this range of like a really like car in 320 horsepower

1186
01:11:45.391 --> 01:11:47.880
engine.
And that's where a lot of these guys like that,
uh,

1187
01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:50.940
that race car driver that was married to Ashley Judd,
what is his name?

1188
01:11:50.941 --> 01:11:53.670
Dario Franchitti.
Yes.
Yeah.
That,

1189
01:11:53.790 --> 01:11:58.790
that guy has the sickest 1973 Porsche with a 325 horsepower engine.

1190
01:12:01.171 --> 01:12:04.010
Now think about that much in that car so much.

1191
01:12:05.050 --> 01:12:09.390
But that doesn't sound like much in the era of 648 horsepower.

1192
01:12:09.390 --> 01:12:12.660
Zr One YouTube's fault.
Dude,

1193
01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:17.530
I swear to God or your your youtube.
Well forgive me dude.

1194
01:12:17.550 --> 01:12:20.880
I live in a world of,
if you can't beat them,
join them.

1195
01:12:20.881 --> 01:12:25.380
I got Exxon mobile stock coming out of my fucking ass hole right now because you

1196
01:12:25.381 --> 01:12:27.270
know why I make fucking money on it?

1197
01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:32.280
That's why you make money on Exxon mobile stock keeps going up going up.

1198
01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:35.920
And the buy Exxon stock.
Yeah.
Dude,
I have tons of it because you're,

1199
01:12:35.930 --> 01:12:38.270
you're probably the Illuminati or something that makes you,
I mean,

1200
01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:41.170
you can't beat them.
Join them.
I'm not going to take part of the world.

1201
01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:45.300
They order the same thing.
It's,
it's,
it's,

1202
01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:49.500
you see a video of a super with 1200 horsepower and then with 1500 horsepower,

1203
01:12:49.570 --> 01:12:50.403
right.

1204
01:12:50.690 --> 01:12:55.690
When the truth is the limit of modern tire technology is like 600.

1205
01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:59.370
That's about where it stops.
Beyond that,

1206
01:12:59.371 --> 01:13:04.190
it's like we'll spin or going off a cliff or into a fucking wall or,
you know,

1207
01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:06.360
and,
and people talk about all the,

1208
01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:09.390
the newest modern super cars that aren't stick shift.
Right.

1209
01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:11.460
But you can't have it both ways.

1210
01:13:11.461 --> 01:13:16.060
You can't sell somebody a 700 horsepowers stick shift car.
You know why?

1211
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:20.190
Cause will fucking die.
Yeah.
Like you don't want miss bad advertising.
I mean,

1212
01:13:20.191 --> 01:13:21.450
imagine,
you know,

1213
01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:26.160
if they sold a 500 horsepower fucking gt three Rs to the,
to the public,

1214
01:13:26.161 --> 01:13:27.510
well let's go,
let's,
well,

1215
01:13:27.511 --> 01:13:30.300
let's start breaking that down because that really is what they're doing.

1216
01:13:30.301 --> 01:13:34.920
If you buy a Zr one,
you buy a corvette Zr one you can walk into any dealership,

1217
01:13:34.921 --> 01:13:37.500
but if you have the cash and it's a lot of money,
but it's worth it

1218
01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:43.710
to about 120 yeah,
and they're fucking worth every penny.

1219
01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:47.460
Yeah.
It's the bargain of the supercar world.
640 horsepower,

1220
01:13:47.461 --> 01:13:52.170
zero to 60 on a stick in three seconds in first gear.
You don't just shift gears.

1221
01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:53.580
He just dumped a clutch,

1222
01:13:53.581 --> 01:13:58.170
stomp the gas and watch this first gear.

1223
01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:02.490
Dump it.
Easy Button for launch control.
It's just built in.

1224
01:14:02.491 --> 01:14:06.750
So you put it in first,
push the clutch,
shitty flat.
You want to push a button?

1225
01:14:06.751 --> 01:14:08.940
I don't want launch control.
That shit's ridiculous.

1226
01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:13.420
With 648 horsepower car.
Oh,

1227
01:14:13.421 --> 01:14:17.740
I launched 1100 horsepower Nissan Gtr.

1228
01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:22.450
I lit up all four tires through three years.
And you know what?

1229
01:14:22.451 --> 01:14:26.410
The guy who owned the car said he was going to go for more.
He was,

1230
01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:29.430
he wanted to take the car back and get more horsepower.

1231
01:14:29.890 --> 01:14:33.120
This is how boring the Nissan Gtr is.
That 1100 horsepower.

1232
01:14:33.130 --> 01:14:37.210
Does this sound like you're fucking,
I'll extension to,
you know,
to me it's a,

1233
01:14:37.211 --> 01:14:41.710
it's an extension of the man's need for technological innovation.

1234
01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:43.090
It's the same thing.
It's just,

1235
01:14:43.091 --> 01:14:46.270
it's transferred into gears and horsepower and you know,

1236
01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:49.370
handling and did the Newburg ring times and

1237
01:14:51.450 --> 01:14:54.690
Caicos to me about bigger is better.
I want more.
No,

1238
01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:57.700
I think it's just foolishness.
It's like bodybuilder mentality.
You know,

1239
01:14:57.830 --> 01:15:01.180
body builds up a 30 lb.
Women can choke you out.

1240
01:15:01.181 --> 01:15:04.600
I'll just do is hang on for three weeks.
I better run out of gas.
Right.
I mean,

1241
01:15:04.601 --> 01:15:07.870
would you rather own a car with your heart and earn money?

1242
01:15:08.010 --> 01:15:13.010
Would you rather own a car that went fast on paper or felt fast when you drove

1243
01:15:13.271 --> 01:15:18.190
it felt fast when you drove it for sure that that was [inaudible] that was Dario

1244
01:15:18.191 --> 01:15:21.460
is rationalization or explanation for his car.

1245
01:15:21.461 --> 01:15:26.240
He was talking about his car being like 2000 something pounds,
325 horsepower,

1246
01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:31.030
which is a lot for,
and it,
it's a dream.
It's like this is what he enjoys.

1247
01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:33.070
No balance,
no power.

1248
01:15:33.071 --> 01:15:38.071
Assisted steering system powers a stupidly fast car.

1249
01:15:38.370 --> 01:15:40.240
Yeah.
And Weird fast,
you know,

1250
01:15:40.241 --> 01:15:42.790
like you feel like if you're going 40 fills or you're going to 80

1251
01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:47.990
that's what I'm about.
Scary fucking drive.

1252
01:15:47.991 --> 01:15:51.970
Like a fun and you're safe to drive a fucking coon tosh.
Oh Geez.

1253
01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.710
I mean you could die at any second.

1254
01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:57.490
It's like a plane that doesn't have wings or I drove,
you know this thing,

1255
01:15:57.491 --> 01:16:02.170
the Hennessey Venom Gt.
I saw that video yellow one.
No,
that's had a yellow one.

1256
01:16:02.171 --> 01:16:02.980
They did have a yellow one.

1257
01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:06.790
Top Gear magazine did a thing with it with yellow coffee.
Yeah.

1258
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:09.190
It's ridic.
I mean they're,

1259
01:16:09.191 --> 01:16:12.370
you know Steven Tyler has one of these things we're talking about old rock
stars.

1260
01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:17.000
This fucking bones are made of whatever they're made up.
However baby.
Yeah.

1261
01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:17.900
Whenever you replace

1262
01:16:19.450 --> 01:16:24.220
the bones or baby powder in straws,
lightly taped together.
Yeah.

1263
01:16:24.221 --> 01:16:25.810
You know,
and I'm driving this thing and I'm going,

1264
01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:30.580
I go zero to 200 in 15 seconds.
Oh my God.

1265
01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:34.640
And it's like you are selling this to,
you were staying in Tyler.

1266
01:16:34.641 --> 01:16:37.720
That's the kind of car you'd want to like fuck it.
I'm Steven Tyler.
Exactly.

1267
01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:41.260
That car is all about power to weight ratio in the saddle.
Again,

1268
01:16:41.261 --> 01:16:45.730
he deserves some credit,
another check,
big deal.
200 miles an hour.

1269
01:16:45.790 --> 01:16:50.790
That's something Tyler had them put a this crazy radio system in the car or they

1270
01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:54.900
added like 80 kilograms to the car,

1271
01:16:54.901 --> 01:16:58.300
so they gave it more horsepower to offset the radio.

1272
01:16:58.301 --> 01:17:03.301
That's okay because it has learned that even hundred why would that even fact at

1273
01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:07.150
1300 watts need to go?

1274
01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:10.120
That's too crazy.
Every,

1275
01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:11.870
<v 2>every kilogram counts.
Yeah.</v>

1276
01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:16.310
I think I'm driving enjoyment is what's important and it's not about being a

1277
01:17:16.311 --> 01:17:21.311
fucking complete total maniac and that's what people really miss out on.

1278
01:17:21.321 --> 01:17:22.041
Like you don't understand,

1279
01:17:22.041 --> 01:17:26.600
like you can drive at a normal safe speed and not be a dick head.

1280
01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:30.950
Enjoy driving.
Yeah.
These are fun cars.
We have live in a cool time.

1281
01:17:30.970 --> 01:17:32.620
There was the mom with Baltimore.

1282
01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:37.280
My son was like 12 and he said to me,
we're going somewhere.

1283
01:17:37.281 --> 01:17:40.940
It's like dead is driving fun.
And it was a really,

1284
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.870
I hadn't even thought about it before and I said I hadn't thought about it in a

1285
01:17:44.871 --> 01:17:47.570
long time since I started driving and I said,
yeah,

1286
01:17:47.571 --> 01:17:52.571
actually dry your spot and it should be fun car man.

1287
01:17:52.761 --> 01:17:54.680
If you're in a fun car.
Driving is fun.

1288
01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:58.880
It's also like why isn't it any more like why was it at one point in time?

1289
01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:01.420
Why isn't it anymore too many stop lights,

1290
01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:04.970
movies like vanishing point and the first Canon ball and shit.

1291
01:18:04.971 --> 01:18:08.030
It's like love vanishing point.
Able to like run from the cops.

1292
01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:10.850
I mean can you even fathom trying to run from the cops?

1293
01:18:10.851 --> 01:18:14.540
Smokey and the bandit ran from the cops in a car and sometimes they would,

1294
01:18:14.541 --> 01:18:19.070
when you run from cops,
helicopters,
they're tasing you.

1295
01:18:19.071 --> 01:18:21.500
It's on youtube.
Like you could run and get away.

1296
01:18:21.501 --> 01:18:25.850
At one point we had a four 40 with a six pack on open throttle,

1297
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:30.510
a fire
in a 15 second quarter mile,

1298
01:18:30.690 --> 01:18:35.690
get away cowboy boots and a Jean jacket and the sweat and it was his beard.

1299
01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:39.770
You've ever run from the cops show?
No.
Did you get away?

1300
01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:42.050
I got pulled over by the way.

1301
01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:46.610
I got away once and then I ran once and I got caught and then let go.
Whoa.

1302
01:18:46.611 --> 01:18:48.500
That's some good Tony.
Alex Roy.

1303
01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:52.000
I got caught doing an Alex Roy's BMW.

1304
01:18:52.001 --> 01:18:55.700
I'm going to have the German police department,
Soul German guy.

1305
01:18:55.701 --> 01:18:57.470
They know about Alex Roy.
Joe.

1306
01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:02.040
He's one of those coast to coast guys and Trans Continental set of records.

1307
01:19:02.050 --> 01:19:03.200
I mean coast to coast.

1308
01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:06.290
Alex Roy is a fundamentally can you drive from New York to La?

1309
01:19:06.650 --> 01:19:11.420
It's a thing to it and he did it and he wrote a book and he's dangerous.

1310
01:19:12.230 --> 01:19:13.340
Big trick was recommend.

1311
01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:18.560
BMW tarted up like a German police feel for the actual being more than you did

1312
01:19:20.091 --> 01:19:23.810
storm chasers.
Yeah,
for the actual run it with storm chasing.

1313
01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:28.520
He later went to German police livery but we were driving that car in South

1314
01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:31.850
Carolina and it has all kinds of in it.
Right.

1315
01:19:31.851 --> 01:19:35.390
So like all kinds of like electronics,
like really crazy stuff.

1316
01:19:35.391 --> 01:19:39.080
So we're going with the helicopter look spotting for police cars,

1317
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:42.830
that kind of stomach 60 through South Carolina.

1318
01:19:42.890 --> 01:19:47.170
I'm driving right tail lights out.
No.
You had to tail light cutout.

1319
01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:51.020
So we've no tail lights.
No brake light dark.
Isn't that what you call it?
Yeah,

1320
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:52.620
it's like a driving submarine.

1321
01:19:53.530 --> 01:19:58.460
Zooming a buck 60 silent and it has night vision so he could see a cop in the

1322
01:19:58.461 --> 01:20:02.810
trees.
Oh my God.
So we cop was in the trees.
Yeah cause you could see his,

1323
01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:04.130
their engines are idling.

1324
01:20:04.131 --> 01:20:08.340
So you can see the heat signature through Jackie Gleason.
Oh the trees are ahead

1325
01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:11.910
<v 1>ahead.
He's hiding in the trees.
So he gets us.</v>

1326
01:20:11.911 --> 01:20:14.010
But we're full dark at this point.

1327
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:18.420
So I tried to run and we got off the first exit and turn left.
Right.

1328
01:20:18.421 --> 01:20:21.240
Because if you're running from the cops you always turn left.

1329
01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:25.560
80% of cops go right because the right is the easier turn.

1330
01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:27.710
Oh you'd always go left if you're running from the cops.

1331
01:20:27.730 --> 01:20:32.560
We go strategy all you then make another left onto some crowed and it was like

1332
01:20:32.610 --> 01:20:35.400
be advised,
hurry,
like get out and got out and started pissing.

1333
01:20:35.401 --> 01:20:39.910
I'm looking at the fucking left to go into traffic.
Yeah.

1334
01:20:39.911 --> 01:20:44.130
So you always want to make the harder term,
which is the left,
the very least.

1335
01:20:44.131 --> 01:20:46.620
It buys you some time and in this case it didn't work well.

1336
01:20:46.621 --> 01:20:50.160
The cop came over and was like,
you know what?
What is this car were you doing

1337
01:20:52.650 --> 01:20:57.060
right now?
How about this?
Pull the fuck over and let the cop arrest you.

1338
01:20:57.270 --> 01:21:01.950
Don't go left.
Sorry.
Vice pro.

1339
01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:05.370
The best consumer advice would be it'll cost you even more when they catch you

1340
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:07.070
probably these days.
They've got drones.

1341
01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:09.930
Probably have a drone in your car that you're not really aware of that we'll

1342
01:21:09.931 --> 01:21:12.480
find out about next year in the rental car they do.

1343
01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:16.500
The new Bradley Manning released,
released these documents.
The PS,

1344
01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:19.890
all that shit is I now have a lawyer that I have to pay like a thousand dollars

1345
01:21:19.891 --> 01:21:23.530
a month just to keep me fucking driving.
That.
Shay catches up with you.

1346
01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:27.630
What happened?
I've gotten many,
many,
many,
many,
many,
many.

1347
01:21:27.631 --> 01:21:31.650
You have a radar detector that only works some of the time.

1348
01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:35.420
This is an important message for the young people.
Learn from Matt Farah.
Exactly.

1349
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:35.860
Do that.

1350
01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:40.740
Will you lose your license or costs you a lawyer?

1351
01:21:40.741 --> 01:21:43.800
A guy in a tie.
If you'll give me shit because I don't like street drift.

1352
01:21:43.801 --> 01:21:46.320
Like Chris Harris,
like he's in like a foreign country.

1353
01:21:46.590 --> 01:21:48.810
You know what I imagine I went up on fucking Mulholland.

1354
01:21:48.811 --> 01:21:50.490
It started street drifting on video.

1355
01:21:50.491 --> 01:21:54.150
How quickly would I be in jail for that shit?
Five minutes.
Like right away.

1356
01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:59.310
He's street drifts in an old Porsche around sheep.
I'm not joking.

1357
01:21:59.910 --> 01:22:03.150
New Zealand.
Perfect,
perfect.
Perfect.

1358
01:22:03.151 --> 01:22:05.000
Nine 11 by Chris Harris.

1359
01:22:05.310 --> 01:22:10.310
This motherfucker takes this 1971 something Porsche with a 300 horsepower

1360
01:22:10.681 --> 01:22:14.730
engine.
Wow.
He built it like before singer was doing these reconstructions.

1361
01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:19.760
He put like modern chassies had Tuttle do the full race suspension and full

1362
01:22:20.461 --> 01:22:23.980
like,
like inside Alicante total rally cage.

1363
01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:27.660
I went to the trial shop in Europe,
in England.
It was crazy.

1364
01:22:28.590 --> 01:22:32.370
I would geek out if I went there,
so I never met him before.
I didn't know he was,

1365
01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:34.240
Hey Matt,
this is Richard.
Oh Nice to meet you.

1366
01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:36.510
Would you like to try my new dog box?

1367
01:22:36.690 --> 01:22:39.030
And he had a nine 11 when the fucking dog box said it.
Oh,

1368
01:22:39.031 --> 01:22:42.540
here's Chris Sweat this,
this,
this crazy fuck those white things.

1369
01:22:42.541 --> 01:22:47.541
Those are sheep and this dude is going stir around this corner.

1370
01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:53.370
That is a hot look like
beautiful.

1371
01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:57.730
Yeah.
That's a night.
What is that 71 what he did was he put a,

1372
01:22:57.731 --> 01:23:02.731
a modern engine and a more modern gearbox in and still air cooled air cooled to

1373
01:23:03.861 --> 01:23:06.760
be tweaked.
The suspension.
Oh yeah,
totally.
Completely.

1374
01:23:07.490 --> 01:23:12.190
But what it essentially is is the best you could do of every year.

1375
01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:14.860
That's gorgeous.
It's crazy.
Well,
you know what it is.

1376
01:23:14.861 --> 01:23:19.170
It's like there's some call to nostalgia when we look at his classic show and

1377
01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:23.640
you get him going sideways.
I love watch this.

1378
01:23:24.490 --> 01:23:27.900
There's some called in his style Jah.
Like when you see like a classic shape,

1379
01:23:28.330 --> 01:23:30.220
watch this,
watch this.
Oh,

1380
01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:36.310
kind of balls.
You have to have the street drift.
Whether it's sheep and look,

1381
01:23:36.311 --> 01:23:40.060
he's Keegan.
He got key cut the curb.
This is like,

1382
01:23:40.330 --> 01:23:43.660
this is like the a ballet move.
It's like a pure wet.

1383
01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:48.700
What would the special of the car,
that car,
that car was under 2000 pounds.

1384
01:23:48.730 --> 01:23:51.040
Wow.
And it's like somebody's car,

1385
01:23:51.041 --> 01:23:56.041
like I don't know how you get a this skill and be the balls to borrow someone's

1386
01:23:57.041 --> 01:24:00.070
car.
No,
that's his car.
Well that would know that was his,

1387
01:24:00.071 --> 01:24:05.071
but he does it with car to borrow someone's car and then Hawk it backwards into

1388
01:24:05.291 --> 01:24:08.680
a fucking,
I say,
governor,

1389
01:24:08.681 --> 01:24:10.740
you don't mind if I take your car.

1390
01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:14.540
Did you hear about this poor fucking auto journalist who was driving a Porsche

1391
01:24:14.570 --> 01:24:18.290
nine 17 race car and blew the gearbox?
It was it,

1392
01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:21.760
I can't remember the guy's name.
And it was a journalist or drew.

1393
01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:26.770
He was driving a bar,
you know,
a million dollar Porsche.
Wow.
Lou,
the gear.

1394
01:24:26.771 --> 01:24:29.680
How did he do?
Is it his fault?
Apparently missed a shift,

1395
01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:32.620
but I hear that's all it takes is a ship,
which was like just shit.

1396
01:24:32.621 --> 01:24:35.380
Where's Ralph Nader?
Exactly.
It's fucking thing's a piece of shit.

1397
01:24:35.381 --> 01:24:37.210
But the old gonna blow up like a pinto.

1398
01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:40.590
The fucking owner of the car sued the guy in the bankruptcy.
Oh,

1399
01:24:40.591 --> 01:24:44.830
let me literally sued the guy into bankruptcy.
So I that kind of shit.

1400
01:24:44.831 --> 01:24:45.960
I'm reading and going.
Yeah.

1401
01:24:46.460 --> 01:24:50.200
And you know the audiences like you didn't fucking drifted you fucking pussy

1402
01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:54.430
going,
this guy's,
someone's going to sue me out of business if I do that.

1403
01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:57.100
Did you ever see the video of Eddie Griffin crashing and

1404
01:24:58.740 --> 01:25:03.160
crashing and Enzo into this cement barrier and it's of a brother can't drive?

1405
01:25:03.870 --> 01:25:08.860
Yeah.
Yeah,
it was.
It was.
It was horrific.
Remember when that bottle was full?

1406
01:25:08.890 --> 01:25:12.880
Yeah.
This whiskey,
it used to be in that bottle.
This whiskey is fantastic.

1407
01:25:13.090 --> 01:25:17.680
They're not Todd's a whiskey fan.
Call a cab son.
That's what I recommend.

1408
01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:23.200
Drinking bottled waters.
There's pee break at some point there.
Here it is.

1409
01:25:23.260 --> 01:25:26.650
Oh Jesus.
Watch this again.
By the way,

1410
01:25:27.010 --> 01:25:30.880
for folks who don't know what we're looking at,
this is $1 million car.

1411
01:25:31.210 --> 01:25:36.210
He hit him and rigid legitimate million dollar car and if I recall,

1412
01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:40.710
it was understeer understeer into a wall.
Complete under stairs.

1413
01:25:41.020 --> 01:25:45.250
Oh
Nasty.

1414
01:25:45.251 --> 01:25:49.510
It was in the videos.
A total complete catastrophic loss.
Control the car.

1415
01:25:49.511 --> 01:25:52.720
You want to grab your balls when that happens,
because that hurts so much.

1416
01:25:53.090 --> 01:25:57.940
It was totaled.
It was,
but as is the case,
what's a $4 million cars?

1417
01:25:57.941 --> 01:25:59.830
It's never really total.
Sorry.

1418
01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:04.040
A guy actually bought that car at salvage at bought

1419
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:07.160
<v 2>the body.
You ever see the p four five Jim Glick and houses?</v>

1420
01:26:07.161 --> 01:26:10.580
He re bodied an Enzo p four five no,
check it out.

1421
01:26:10.581 --> 01:26:15.581
Look up the p four slash five so he got the original body from that.

1422
01:26:15.801 --> 01:26:20.630
When everybody's like an encyclopedia,
he took that wrecked Enzo,

1423
01:26:20.750 --> 01:26:24.620
put twin turbos on it,
and then they went and ran Bonneville with it.

1424
01:26:24.621 --> 01:26:27.470
I think it did like two 30 or two something at Bonneville.

1425
01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:32.680
So the dog dish fucking wheels on it and shit like a Bonneville Enzo from that

1426
01:26:34.011 --> 01:26:36.140
wrecked mess.
So what,
how did I go?

1427
01:26:36.150 --> 01:26:39.500
Did like the insurance coverage and the guy like cell,
the body of it all,

1428
01:26:39.501 --> 01:26:42.590
they wrecked so many cars during.
That's The p four five right there.

1429
01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:46.830
That's what $5 million gets you.
Oh my God.
That's insane.
Looking.
Yeah,

1430
01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:50.000
that's a fair deal.
Uh,
this is a guy named Jim Glicken house,

1431
01:26:50.001 --> 01:26:51.410
who's from the town where I grew up,

1432
01:26:51.411 --> 01:26:56.411
who has lots of money and likes a vintage race cars and had Pininfarina re body.

1433
01:26:57.170 --> 01:26:58.040
His Enzo.

1434
01:26:58.430 --> 01:27:02.570
The design was by Jason Castree Yoda who designed the Freud five,
nine,

1435
01:27:02.590 --> 01:27:05.580
nine Maserati granturismo.
Um,

1436
01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:08.150
this was 23 years old dude.

1437
01:27:08.151 --> 01:27:11.210
The Guy designed this that is the most like Super Dick Looking car.

1438
01:27:12.620 --> 01:27:17.570
That's a game over it's game over game over one of a kind Ferrari.
Yeah.

1439
01:27:17.810 --> 01:27:22.550
That is ridiculous.
Looking is wild looking.
It is.
It's really cool.

1440
01:27:22.551 --> 01:27:27.400
Like it's Kinda Nsx see like with the hood.
Yeah.
And then you know,
like it,

1441
01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:31.580
it reminds you of like a lot of different cars and so a lot of reuse from

1442
01:27:31.581 --> 01:27:35.510
vintage fur like late sixties Ferrari race cars.
Yeah.

1443
01:27:35.511 --> 01:27:38.090
Ferrari's a completely different statement.
Yeah.

1444
01:27:38.130 --> 01:27:41.060
That's that super ball or statement.
So funny though.

1445
01:27:41.061 --> 01:27:45.440
If they are to plan my day Gig,

1446
01:27:45.441 --> 01:27:48.350
I rent exotic cars.
My company's called Gotham dream cars.

1447
01:27:48.380 --> 01:27:51.980
And what kind of cars you get in Ferrari's ma'am?
Bars.

1448
01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:56.660
Do you ever get manuals for ours of the stick?
See in the history of our company,

1449
01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:58.970
we've had 97 cars,

1450
01:27:59.090 --> 01:28:01.820
seven of them have been manual transmissions.

1451
01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:07.100
All seven had been totaled compared to one out of 90 of the other.
So no,

1452
01:28:07.101 --> 01:28:12.020
we don't buy stick cars anymore.
That's hilarious.
People can't drive silly.

1453
01:28:12.050 --> 01:28:13.550
It starts with a hey man,

1454
01:28:13.551 --> 01:28:18.050
watch this and ends up smashing into some kind of stationary object ends up like

1455
01:28:18.051 --> 01:28:21.680
that Ferrari.
There's a Gotham dream cars website.
Was that story?

1456
01:28:21.681 --> 01:28:24.770
I don't remember.
It was Beverly hills,
I think.
I feel like it was Beverly hills.

1457
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:28.880
Somebody uh,
parked their car,
the valet,
it was a Ferrari.

1458
01:28:28.881 --> 01:28:32.890
It was a four or five a and a thank and some Valet Chi decided to take it

1459
01:28:32.891 --> 01:28:37.490
sideways around a corner and smash right into a parked car in half.

1460
01:28:38.060 --> 01:28:41.390
That's fucking great.
It's that,
I mean,
what,

1461
01:28:41.410 --> 01:28:44.740
what those things are is so alien to the,
the uh,

1462
01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:48.560
person who hasn't driven a normal person cannot comprehend how fast the car like

1463
01:28:48.561 --> 01:28:51.940
that is.
There are time machines.
You know I remember that was the,
when I,

1464
01:28:51.970 --> 01:28:54.230
the first car that I realized what it was,
that nine nine six turbo,

1465
01:28:54.231 --> 01:28:55.580
that was the first year.
They were really fast,

1466
01:28:55.610 --> 01:28:59.570
very fast car and really weird like the four wheel drive was weird.

1467
01:28:59.610 --> 01:29:02.010
It was just like wood grip to the ground.

1468
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:05.760
You could feel the power shifting around.
I didn't know that was for,
yeah,

1469
01:29:05.761 --> 01:29:08.610
they started with a nine nine three the nine nine three the last,

1470
01:29:08.611 --> 01:29:11.200
the air cooled cars.
The turbo was a four wheel drive cars.

1471
01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:12.950
Those cars are going for right now.
A Lot,

1472
01:29:12.951 --> 01:29:15.450
right fucking nine nine three turbos are a hundred grand.

1473
01:29:15.490 --> 01:29:20.490
Nine nine three turbo s's are $300,000 the 903 terrible answers,

1474
01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:26.040
so sweet without the little vents on the side.
The back wheels,

1475
01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:30.810
Seinfeld's got one baby blue fucking boss.
Every bad ass Porsche that say,

1476
01:29:30.811 --> 01:29:35.280
here's the 73 gt three Rs.
He has everything.
I'd been in his garage.

1477
01:29:35.281 --> 01:29:38.690
He has everything.
That's a lot of good money.
That's that fuck.

1478
01:29:38.730 --> 01:29:41.670
That's called Seinfeld Seinfeld money right there.

1479
01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:46.770
He's got the Porsche,
which is the oldest known original,

1480
01:29:46.771 --> 01:29:51.660
unrestored Porsche in existence.
The vin number was eight.
Oh my God.

1481
01:29:52.730 --> 01:29:54.810
That's not going to restore it.
Is he

1482
01:29:56.430 --> 01:30:00.660
like that 73 Rs?
Correct me if I'm wrong.
It's worth a stupid amount of money,

1483
01:30:00.661 --> 01:30:05.310
isn't it?
300 to 400 probably drives that on the street.
It just takes it out.

1484
01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:07.650
He's got insurance.
Well,
that guy Glicken house,

1485
01:30:07.651 --> 01:30:09.900
who's got the p four five that I showed you,

1486
01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:15.080
he has a 68 gt 40 that ran at Sebring that he converted to a street car and has

1487
01:30:17.101 --> 01:30:19.970
40,000 street miles on it.
My good friend,

1488
01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:24.450
he's got a low law that he's got street miles on.
He's nuts.

1489
01:30:24.750 --> 01:30:28.320
He's great.
I love it.
I love guys like that.
Yeah.
They use their car.

1490
01:30:28.370 --> 01:30:30.600
I bought a Lamar prototype,
put air conditioning in it,

1491
01:30:30.601 --> 01:30:35.550
call it a street car and he's got 50,000 street on it.
That's bad us.
That's,

1492
01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:40.260
that's the right way to roll.
It's not a hot wheel.
He's having a ride every day.

1493
01:30:40.290 --> 01:30:42.070
Everywhere he goes.
He's on a ride.
Yeah.

1494
01:30:42.090 --> 01:30:44.220
It's not as simple as always an adventure.

1495
01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:49.350
And here I am in my fucking voltage is like a sensory deprivation chamber,

1496
01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:53.100
which everyone else said I had to talk to you about.
Those volts are super quiet.

1497
01:30:53.101 --> 01:30:56.910
Right.
There's silence.
Just dead silent bolts are genius though.

1498
01:30:57.070 --> 01:31:02.040
Like electricity.
The thing about electric cars is you have all power like that.

1499
01:31:02.220 --> 01:31:05.040
There's no power curve.
It's on or it's off,

1500
01:31:05.130 --> 01:31:09.240
<v 0>right?
Yeah.
I've driven golf carts,
so I'd imagine it just,
but yeah,</v>

1501
01:31:09.241 --> 01:31:10.380
it's right through there.
And to the right,

1502
01:31:10.740 --> 01:31:13.290
I would imagine it'd be like a super powerful golf cart.

1503
01:31:13.340 --> 01:31:17.610
They're unbelievably fast.
Yeah.
They don't have like a gear to go through.

1504
01:31:17.611 --> 01:31:21.290
It's just one gear.
Yep.
I've seen that with the Teslas.
Yup.
I've never,
I've,

1505
01:31:21.330 --> 01:31:22.700
we saw,
um,
uh,

1506
01:31:22.810 --> 01:31:26.950
that one Tesla s that our friend from the show had them then.

1507
01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:30.870
Yeah.
Yeah.
And um,
the,
yeah,

1508
01:31:30.871 --> 01:31:35.000
the guy who was here who drove it around entirely around the country.
Right.

1509
01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:39.330
He hit every single point around the country.
The border.
Yeah.
And,
uh,
the,

1510
01:31:39.331 --> 01:31:42.240
our other friend in DC that had one too,
but I've seen the,
uh,

1511
01:31:42.241 --> 01:31:46.100
the old one or the sports car one small.
Oh yeah,

1512
01:31:46.110 --> 01:31:51.110
that's just a d r And d and p I guess fast as hell.

1513
01:31:51.421 --> 01:31:54.780
It's like a lotus with electricity.
Yeah.
It's a weird thing.

1514
01:31:54.810 --> 01:31:57.000
Like the go fast electric thing.

1515
01:31:58.170 --> 01:31:59.840
<v 2>I just,
it</v>

1516
01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:04.160
<v 0>doesn't like,
you know,
you're used to your car like ramping up.
But uh,</v>

1517
01:32:05.570 --> 01:32:09.100
it's that natural progression thing that we,
we've come accustomed to.

1518
01:32:09.490 --> 01:32:11.980
And also in these electrical engines they go,
oh,
you don't have to do that.

1519
01:32:12.010 --> 01:32:13.930
One gear is good.
And he's like,
what do you mean here?

1520
01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:16.660
Here's good duck and one gear.
We good,
we're electric,

1521
01:32:16.661 --> 01:32:18.280
we've got a whole totally different thing we're doing.

1522
01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:20.620
It's like a complete transformation.
Yeah.

1523
01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:23.370
<v 2>And because yeah,
you have the feel,
the touch,</v>

1524
01:32:23.371 --> 01:32:26.700
the electro mechanic ability to go through one,
two,
three,
four,
five,

1525
01:32:26.701 --> 01:32:29.730
six and now it's just on or it's off.

1526
01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:33.500
<v 0>Well,
yeah,
that's the thing that people really appreciate about the older cars.</v>

1527
01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:38.360
Like a bill burr was here once and he had this,
uh,
God,
I want to say the year,

1528
01:32:38.630 --> 01:32:42.980
but I think it was a 50s pickup truck and beautiful.

1529
01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:45.830
And Bill was so proud of this car.
I mean,

1530
01:32:45.950 --> 01:32:48.860
bill is a bill's in an ace of a guy.

1531
01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:52.790
He's a really hilarious standup comedian and a cool guy.

1532
01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:57.000
And he likes like interesting shit.
Bill Burr,
fucking dude,
Bill.

1533
01:32:57.020 --> 01:33:00.470
The other greatest takedowns I've ever heard him versus fucking Philadelphia.

1534
01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:04.850
How?
Yeah,
that was awesome.
Did he had a shifter on the floor?
No,
no,
no.

1535
01:33:04.851 --> 01:33:09.230
I believe the shift.
It was on the tree.
The tree.
He,
Bill Burr.
I don't,

1536
01:33:09.290 --> 01:33:11.990
I don't know the,
I don't know the make or the year.

1537
01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:16.280
It's a really old pickup truck that he actually drives around.
Really?
Yeah.

1538
01:33:16.281 --> 01:33:17.450
He was so proud of it.

1539
01:33:17.570 --> 01:33:21.170
He brought it to the ice house last time we did a podcast together and he pulls

1540
01:33:21.171 --> 01:33:26.060
up in this thing.
It's got the old breaks,
old suspension,
old everything.
Oh,

1541
01:33:26.090 --> 01:33:29.450
it's sketchy as fuck.
Well,
I think he's just,
you know,

1542
01:33:29.451 --> 01:33:33.190
slow and steady wins the race,
but I think he does.
Yeah,
yeah.
He really,

1543
01:33:33.210 --> 01:33:35.300
he just loved the fact that he's driving this thing.

1544
01:33:35.330 --> 01:33:38.750
He loves the fact that he's in this,
this really ancient like,

1545
01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:42.360
<v 2>I mean if you want to be,
you know,
environmentally friendly,</v>

1546
01:33:42.361 --> 01:33:47.130
keeping a car like that on the road is way more efficient than buying a fucking

1547
01:33:47.131 --> 01:33:51.570
Prius or whatever.
Don't participate in the new car.

1548
01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:56.610
Fucking Todd.
He says,
but I don't know.
I'm not here to be an environmentalist.

1549
01:33:56.611 --> 01:34:00.360
I bought a volt for very selfish reasons to save my own ass money.

1550
01:34:00.710 --> 01:34:04.770
I my commute to Prius's so I'm not saying holier than thou.

1551
01:34:04.830 --> 01:34:09.660
<v 0>Does it let you get in the car lane or anything?
The carpooling,
carpooling Solo.</v>

1552
01:34:09.870 --> 01:34:14.040
That's enough reason.
Reason enough.
Prius doesn't do that cause it's all hybrid.

1553
01:34:14.250 --> 01:34:15.440
But like a Tesla does

1554
01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:17.640
<v 2>Tesla.
When Tesla volt,</v>

1555
01:34:18.090 --> 01:34:21.060
if I had more money I would have bought it the ugliest car on the planet.

1556
01:34:21.061 --> 01:34:23.020
The leaf will do that.
I think it's heinous.

1557
01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:27.220
<v 0>So all the uh,
electrical,
it's really hilarious when a Prius owner,</v>

1558
01:34:27.221 --> 01:34:28.230
his shit on the way or another.

1559
01:34:29.660 --> 01:34:33.330
<v 2>That's right.
I know you're drunk.
Seriously.
Now that's when you,
you're drunk.</v>

1560
01:34:34.770 --> 01:34:39.600
Prius is there,
uh,
the like the most simple form ever for a car.
The dog,

1561
01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:42.390
me,
don't worry about what it looks like.
The volt is better.

1562
01:34:42.580 --> 01:34:46.730
You know why the Prius has shaped that way?
I agree with you.

1563
01:34:46.731 --> 01:34:50.520
You know why the Prius has shaped that way Todd?
Drag Coefficient.
All right.

1564
01:34:50.521 --> 01:34:53.190
How about this mother fucker?
You want to fucking talk track called,

1565
01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:58.010
do you know what the drag coefficient?
No,
it's 0.26.

1566
01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:01.670
<v 1>Okay.
You know what else has a drag Coefficient and 0.26 corvette stingray,</v>

1567
01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:06.380
Mercedes east 63 AMG has a drag coefficient of 0.26.

1568
01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:10.510
One of those cars is looking to live in New York City.
Is that a faster car?

1569
01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:14.000
Like what is that?
570 horsepower?
Hey Matt,

1570
01:35:14.030 --> 01:35:18.050
what's the price differential?
Uh,
several dollars.
Yeah,
right,
right.

1571
01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:23.200
But I drove a diesel Mercedes e three 50 diesel from Mexico to Oregon on one

1572
01:35:24.171 --> 01:35:25.730
tag.
Mercedes are brilliant.

1573
01:35:25.731 --> 01:35:30.140
I'm not talking about the car and the engineering and an overactive and
slippery.

1574
01:35:30.141 --> 01:35:32.750
Where's your car is unattractive in slippery.
It is.

1575
01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:37.780
And my corvette also attract and it's cheap and it works slippery through the

1576
01:35:37.941 --> 01:35:42.350
air drag coefficient.
I also wax it and k while you were doing things with it,

1577
01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:49.340
but guess what?
This is.
This is where engineering genius.

1578
01:35:49.790 --> 01:35:52.550
I have a 2003 Prius.
My daughter drives.

1579
01:35:52.551 --> 01:35:57.551
It's got 190,000 miles original battery original every grade dude,

1580
01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:03.200
and it still gets like 40 miles a gallon.
If somebody else drives it,
not you.

1581
01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:06.530
You're the,
you're a hundred miles an hour and a Prius guy.

1582
01:36:07.340 --> 01:36:10.720
Fucking hate those too.
I've seen miles an hour and a Prius guys,

1583
01:36:10.721 --> 01:36:14.960
the buddy of mine goes,
hey,
these things are fast.
I said yesterday,
Oh,
oh,

1584
01:36:15.790 --> 01:36:16.730
most should be stopped

1585
01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:22.640
fast isn't enough fast to the imagination for a Prius a hundred miles an hour.

1586
01:36:22.700 --> 01:36:26.030
I remember how we were talking about how it feels like it's gonna fall apart.

1587
01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:28.160
Yes,
exactly right.

1588
01:36:28.290 --> 01:36:32.060
The pharmacy will feel solid because you ever see he's a volt fan.

1589
01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:34.340
Do you ever see the episode of top here?

1590
01:36:34.341 --> 01:36:38.750
Would they went around the track with a m three and a Prius and all the m three

1591
01:36:38.751 --> 01:36:41.190
had to do is keep up with the Prius drivers fat.

1592
01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:43.700
The Prius goes as fast as they can in the m three keeps helping at the end.

1593
01:36:43.770 --> 01:36:47.270
Got better gas mileage.
I believe that it's hilarious.
My Corvette,

1594
01:36:47.271 --> 01:36:51.190
500 horsepower I get 35 miles ago on the highway in that car.
That's amazing.

1595
01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:51.800
It's funny.

1596
01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:56.360
Low drag coefficient and in sixth gear at 80 I'm turning 1300 rpm.

1597
01:36:56.690 --> 01:37:01.590
Wow.
Super gear head radius.
We are geeking out on call.

1598
01:37:01.730 --> 01:37:04.820
You say it's not Kiki to the average person who's not a car gig.

1599
01:37:04.850 --> 01:37:08.060
It's extremely deep listening to your show when you talk about MMA and now it's

1600
01:37:08.061 --> 01:37:12.670
nothing wrong with it.
Hey,
this is nuts.
Listen,
I'm not saying we should stop out.

1601
01:37:13.490 --> 01:37:16.810
What it is is what it is.
We're dorks.
We're dorks.
Let's just face it.
Do that.

1602
01:37:16.870 --> 01:37:20.840
I own I own Dork.
I don't own nothing wrong with being a Dork,

1603
01:37:20.841 --> 01:37:23.240
but we're card dorks.
It's fair.
It happened here.

1604
01:37:23.241 --> 01:37:24.820
Here it's affects nothing wrong with it.

1605
01:37:24.930 --> 01:37:28.310
Do you or do you in your cars or have the perfect car?
Is your,

1606
01:37:28.311 --> 01:37:31.930
is your car perfect for your,
this cool by the way?
They move here.
Yeah,
fire up.

1607
01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:36.570
Um,
I like,
um,
I like older cars.
Uh,

1608
01:37:36.620 --> 01:37:39.800
there's something I like about older cars.
It's very different than,
um,

1609
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:43.160
than newer cars.
I liked the feeling of them.
I liked this,

1610
01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:46.610
this idea that this thing came from a different era.
They have a,

1611
01:37:46.611 --> 01:37:48.870
there's a like a,
a different air to dry.

1612
01:37:48.890 --> 01:37:51.830
The older cars have a permanence about them.
The new cars don't have,

1613
01:37:51.831 --> 01:37:56.610
I mean I fucking touch a new car.
When you can press the body panel,

1614
01:37:56.611 --> 01:38:00.570
it's flexing.
You're like,
this shit isn't going to be here in fucking 50 years.

1615
01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:05.430
Well this is also,
it exists with a,
in a,
in a lot of ways with music as well.

1616
01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:07.830
This is an error of cars that are really like,

1617
01:38:08.010 --> 01:38:10.260
and that error is the same where I liked the music.

1618
01:38:10.261 --> 01:38:12.870
It's the sixties and seventies,
and I don't know what it is.

1619
01:38:13.290 --> 01:38:16.020
I don't know what it tastes,
not stretching or the 90 stretches.

1620
01:38:16.021 --> 01:38:19.950
It stretches deep into the two thousands.
I mean,
I'm a big fan of the black keys.

1621
01:38:20.130 --> 01:38:23.280
I like a lot.
I like all kinds of shit.
I like people,
you know,

1622
01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:27.380
people like playing the good things all the time.
And I get into new things.

1623
01:38:27.430 --> 01:38:32.280
I mean I know I'll have like a rigid sense,
but if I'm alone,
like I'm in my car,

1624
01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:35.340
like I will throw on Voodoo child,
you know,
and um,

1625
01:38:35.550 --> 01:38:38.700
I'll crank that shit to this day.
I felt heard that song a billion times.

1626
01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:42.060
I have a really hard time with classic rock cause it never fucking change it.

1627
01:38:42.870 --> 01:38:46.890
You know what I'm saying?
Doesn't like classic rock is always the same.

1628
01:38:46.950 --> 01:38:49.230
It's the same problem I have with like,
nevermind,

1629
01:38:50.010 --> 01:38:52.200
nevermind is one of the greatest songs ever made,

1630
01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:55.020
but it's the same 13 songs fucking know.
You know,

1631
01:38:55.290 --> 01:38:59.520
you have to be completely in the mood for it.
But at a certain point in time,

1632
01:38:59.590 --> 01:39:03.570
if it becomes like almost an oversaturation point where there's so much music

1633
01:39:03.571 --> 01:39:08.170
out there,
there's so much music that it's like it doesn't,
um,

1634
01:39:08.250 --> 01:39:11.820
you don't even,
you almost don't even have to change decades.
Did you,

1635
01:39:11.910 --> 01:39:15.960
did you see a sound city Dave girls documentary about the sound city studios,

1636
01:39:15.961 --> 01:39:19.640
which is actually not far at all from here.
Jesse,
you like it?

1637
01:39:20.490 --> 01:39:23.850
It's dope.
It's a little bit self serving but also totally dope.

1638
01:39:24.090 --> 01:39:26.550
I was an audio engineering school so it,
Oh yeah,

1639
01:39:26.610 --> 01:39:30.840
me a little bit as well and isn't the,
isn't just the analog ness of it.
Awesome.

1640
01:39:30.930 --> 01:39:33.240
It was awesome that he wanted to take the whole board out of there.

1641
01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:36.930
I look just the same ridiculous of all the stuff that was made on it.

1642
01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:41.520
Like that's,
that's like a lot of the fucking old cars that are working on it.

1643
01:39:41.521 --> 01:39:43.440
I think that's why a lot of people love vinyl.

1644
01:39:43.470 --> 01:39:45.660
Some people love like vinyl records.

1645
01:39:45.661 --> 01:39:50.661
They love like hearing like the scratching and the pops of the needle going over

1646
01:39:50.791 --> 01:39:53.500
the black plastic or whatever the fuck that shits me.

1647
01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:57.960
Never driven a manual transmission Ferrari.
No,
it's,
that's it.
It's that.

1648
01:39:57.990 --> 01:40:02.740
It's why no record imperfections then make it great.
You know,
and,

1649
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:06.990
and they're all very hard to find.
But if you meet someone that has one,

1650
01:40:07.350 --> 01:40:11.960
do yourself a favor and try and drive it because the satisfaction of detailing

1651
01:40:12.450 --> 01:40:17.340
of fucking manual transmission for Ari is so wonderful that you're like,

1652
01:40:17.341 --> 01:40:22.230
why the fuck even if paddles are half a second faster around the track,

1653
01:40:22.231 --> 01:40:23.490
why would you want that?

1654
01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:28.080
Cause it's that Sionix that click click of the gated shifter and like that's

1655
01:40:28.081 --> 01:40:32.560
just such a wonderful analog operation.
Like a watch or something,

1656
01:40:32.561 --> 01:40:36.050
you know?
It's,
yeah,
it's got this,
which is why I think the,
um,

1657
01:40:36.090 --> 01:40:41.090
the Ford gt is what is the most collectible supercar of modern times because it

1658
01:40:42.091 --> 01:40:47.091
has certain things that technology can't make outdated.

1659
01:40:47.730 --> 01:40:50.250
That's the problem.
You think about a Ferrari three six,
right?

1660
01:40:50.260 --> 01:40:53.830
A 10 year old Ferrari that things a pilot shit.
You drive one today,

1661
01:40:54.110 --> 01:40:57.220
<v 2>it's shifts like,
Ooh,
Ooh,
you know,</v>

1662
01:40:57.340 --> 01:41:01.450
it's because the technology is moving as fast as computer technology is,

1663
01:41:01.580 --> 01:41:06.220
whereas something that is analog,
we'll be analog forever.
Right?
So the Ford Gt,

1664
01:41:06.221 --> 01:41:10.900
right?
Think about this supercharged truck engine,
right way overbuilt,

1665
01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:14.590
right aluminum chassis,
manual transmission,

1666
01:41:14.860 --> 01:41:18.160
no traction control,
no stability control.

1667
01:41:18.370 --> 01:41:23.230
A transmission that can handle three times its horsepower and aerodynamics that

1668
01:41:23.231 --> 01:41:28.060
can handle 60 to 70 miles an hour beyond its original top speed.

1669
01:41:28.450 --> 01:41:33.340
That car has the makings for the perfect storm of collector car.

1670
01:41:33.341 --> 01:41:36.340
Awesome.
Which is why the,
uh,
the Ford Gt,

1671
01:41:36.460 --> 01:41:40.750
the Ferrari Enzo in the Mclaren f one or the only collector cars to have

1672
01:41:40.751 --> 01:41:44.830
actually appreciated that were built in the last 15 or so years.

1673
01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:51.000
It's the perfect storm of collectability than he because it will be what it is.

1674
01:41:51.130 --> 01:41:55.330
Yeah.
The modern Ford gt because it would be what it is forever.
Uh,

1675
01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:59.770
for our three 60 was awesome in 2003.
Now you drive and you go,
Holy Shit,

1676
01:41:59.771 --> 01:42:01.270
this thing's a fucking dinosaur.

1677
01:42:01.510 --> 01:42:06.510
But a Ford Gt will always be that your gt three Rs will never feel old because

1678
01:42:07.211 --> 01:42:11.180
it shifts as fast as you can shift it.
You know,
it will,

1679
01:42:11.181 --> 01:42:15.310
all the cars that have that analog fields with them have a permanence about them

1680
01:42:15.490 --> 01:42:20.440
that the latest technology that though this shifts in 80 milliseconds and this

1681
01:42:20.441 --> 01:42:24.340
one shifts in 50 milliseconds and I have eight mode traction control and I have

1682
01:42:24.341 --> 01:42:27.220
12 mode traction control.
That shit gets,
you know,

1683
01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:31.260
that's your hundred and 33 megahertz pentium processor right there.

1684
01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:34.420
You know that Shit's worthless in 50 years.

1685
01:42:34.421 --> 01:42:36.940
But a stick car will always be a stick car.

1686
01:42:37.340 --> 01:42:41.210
<v 1>This,
I think it's sad that baseline,
I think he got shot on fucking top care.</v>

1687
01:42:41.220 --> 01:42:45.890
Todd Joker Rooney.

1688
01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:49.280
I think it's sad that they're stopping making them,

1689
01:42:49.281 --> 01:42:52.520
but I think it's awesome that American cars are picked up where they've dropped

1690
01:42:52.521 --> 01:42:56.600
the ball to think about that.
The Viper,
the vet,
all these,
these are,

1691
01:42:56.601 --> 01:42:57.560
they're sticking with it.

1692
01:42:57.580 --> 01:43:01.100
All these new American cars have manual transmissions and it makes me want to

1693
01:43:01.101 --> 01:43:05.190
get one.
I just got rid of my Shelby.
I had a,
you got rid of it?
Yeah.

1694
01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:09.020
I had a gt 500 car.
I'm scared of the convertible scare me.

1695
01:43:09.130 --> 01:43:13.930
Cause the chassis was made of Legos.
Was that it was 2011 it was very fast.

1696
01:43:13.931 --> 01:43:18.080
The rollbar.
Yeah,
this one.
There's no robot cars.
The best year of the Shelby.

1697
01:43:18.110 --> 01:43:22.310
It was a great car.
Newer one is worse.
Have you driven the new one?
It's so fast.

1698
01:43:22.311 --> 01:43:27.140
It's so crazy.
Too much.
Too much power.
Too much power.
Crazy.
They went power.

1699
01:43:27.141 --> 01:43:29.220
No chassis.
No 40 what did they go to?

1700
01:43:29.330 --> 01:43:34.330
They say six 62 but it's putting down like six 30 at the wheels are God.

1701
01:43:35.511 --> 01:43:39.650
That's insane.
So what does that have the crank?
She's this crime.

1702
01:43:39.930 --> 01:43:44.480
Here's the problem,
right?
Oh my God.
Even within Ford,
right?

1703
01:43:44.481 --> 01:43:45.740
You got a car

1704
01:43:45.870 --> 01:43:49.540
<v 2>like the boss,
the boss,
Mustang.
Right,
which is the best Mustang you can buy.</v>

1705
01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:52.210
That's a great bargain.
Where they say they

1706
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:55.160
<v 1>gave them an m three and they take this Mustang.</v>

1707
01:43:55.170 --> 01:43:59.150
It better make it better than this m three and they actually did that.
Really?

1708
01:43:59.450 --> 01:44:03.170
In terms of dynamically,
yes.
Not In terms of like the leather and shit,

1709
01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:07.040
but the way it handles,
the way it moves,
really?
That they're not nice.
Wow.

1710
01:44:07.041 --> 01:44:10.160
Why don't they get any love?
They get a lot of love,
man.
Yeah,

1711
01:44:10.161 --> 01:44:14.620
but only funnel Dorks,
automotive magazine,
Youtube Dorks.
Who Do you

1712
01:44:16.430 --> 01:44:17.630
hear that from?

1713
01:44:17.631 --> 01:44:20.930
People that it's like a girl because girls won't blow you because you're driving

1714
01:44:20.931 --> 01:44:21.760
one where you go by.

1715
01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:26.090
How are you gonna have a three 28 own rims and get a fucking hummer out of that?

1716
01:44:26.091 --> 01:44:29.930
Easy.
So it is a different time than when I grew up.

1717
01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:33.650
Cause the boss,
yeah,
there's status to IBM.
Does the boss,

1718
01:44:33.651 --> 01:44:38.130
Mustang doesn't convey enough street cred or blurred,

1719
01:44:39.110 --> 01:44:42.400
right?
Yes,
but not to regular people.
That's interesting.

1720
01:44:42.401 --> 01:44:45.490
And then they have the Shelby,
which is Carroll Shelby going right before his,

1721
01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:49.790
you know,
all basically on his fucking death bed going.
Now listen here boys,

1722
01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:52.610
I want to see me.
Shelby before I die,

1723
01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:54.980
does zero to 60 in three and a half seconds.

1724
01:44:55.590 --> 01:45:00.590
That Mustang to go 200 mile an hour and I want that motherfucker to have 600

1725
01:45:01.071 --> 01:45:05.510
horsepower and it,
it better be the fastest God.
I want all the magazine covers.

1726
01:45:05.660 --> 01:45:07.460
I want the fucking magazine and covering.

1727
01:45:07.580 --> 01:45:11.790
I want all them car and driver boys sucking my cock.
And I really what to say.

1728
01:45:12.030 --> 01:45:14.480
You don't want to put words in his mouth.
And that's what he got.

1729
01:45:15.230 --> 01:45:19.430
That's what he got.
He got every magazine cover.
He got fucking Holy Shit.

1730
01:45:19.431 --> 01:45:23.530
It does 200.
But what he didn't build is the best driving Mustang he could buy.

1731
01:45:23.810 --> 01:45:26.710
Right.
So the best drivers,
the on much lighter.

1732
01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:30.530
It was about four 41 or the Shelby you have actually is too much.

1733
01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:35.030
It's too crazy in a coupe.
It's okay.
And it's worried about flipping it.
Yeah.

1734
01:45:35.031 --> 01:45:39.910
It didn't seem very stable and it just,
it was too easy to sit in this.
It was,

1735
01:45:40.420 --> 01:45:44.810
it was a really fun car.
Really Fun.
So I just say that,
uh,
I also,

1736
01:45:44.811 --> 01:45:46.670
one of the reasons why I got it,
it's like I wanted to,

1737
01:45:46.820 --> 01:45:50.090
I wanted to buy a car from a company that didn't take a check from the

1738
01:45:50.091 --> 01:45:53.770
government.
I didn't like,
that's interesting.
I,

1739
01:45:55.100 --> 01:45:58.220
yeah,
I liked the Ford did that.
I was like,
good for you.
You're like,

1740
01:45:58.221 --> 01:46:00.790
you're making enough cool shit that people want to buy it.
Yeah.

1741
01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:05.060
It's a fun ass fucking car.
But the whole convertible thing,
you start thinking,

1742
01:46:05.090 --> 01:46:09.620
hmm,
shouldn't ever do something like this is kind of Dell.
I would feel better.

1743
01:46:10.810 --> 01:46:15.810
The biggest problem with the Shelby brand is that is that their customers don't,

1744
01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:17.031
you know,

1745
01:46:17.031 --> 01:46:21.320
it's a great like five tenths car cruise around in it and you make some noise,

1746
01:46:21.321 --> 01:46:26.270
you do a poll here and there.
It's all about you know,
track and you're like,

1747
01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:30.830
hmm,
I don't know about this.
Yeah.
What it is is a muscle car.

1748
01:46:30.890 --> 01:46:34.760
It's a fun muscle car where you can choose to break the wheels loose a little

1749
01:46:34.761 --> 01:46:38.240
bit.
You could choose to have a little fun.
It's got an amazing sound to,

1750
01:46:38.241 --> 01:46:42.800
it just sounds incredible.
It's just have a stock exhaust,
the stock exhaust.

1751
01:46:42.801 --> 01:46:46.310
It's fucking great tune those things.
Yeah,
they designed them.

1752
01:46:46.311 --> 01:46:50.010
They are optimum sound.
I've been to a proving

1753
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:54.140
<v 2>grounds out of Romeo for,
they come out with that car.
They have a guy and,</v>

1754
01:46:54.141 --> 01:46:57.810
and you know one of the best jobs.
Like you take my job,
which is a good job.

1755
01:46:57.811 --> 01:47:00.390
And then there's,
you know,
pre production tester.
Right.

1756
01:47:00.391 --> 01:47:01.770
Which sounds like a dope job.

1757
01:47:02.070 --> 01:47:07.070
This fucking one pour SAP is out at the Romeo proving grounds and has to do 500

1758
01:47:08.401 --> 01:47:12.990
consecutive full boards.
Rag launches on the clutch.

1759
01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:18.450
This guy,
all he does like four days over,
it'll drag on.

1760
01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:21.810
They can't get a machine to do that.
That seems ridiculous.

1761
01:47:21.870 --> 01:47:23.370
That's pretty bad ass though.

1762
01:47:23.460 --> 01:47:27.580
I mean he literally drives the same 50 feet of go over and

1763
01:47:29.130 --> 01:47:33.060
do not want to fuck with that guy in a red light con.
Oh my God.

1764
01:47:33.061 --> 01:47:36.540
That guy knows that he wouldn't be a professional.
His launch skills,

1765
01:47:36.541 --> 01:47:41.520
most people just ruthless nasty.
He sets the fucking time man alone though.

1766
01:47:42.210 --> 01:47:45.300
Nobody knows.
It's like a tree falling in the woods.
Nobody's there to hear him.

1767
01:47:45.301 --> 01:47:47.580
He raised with people.
People roll up to you.
They don't do it.

1768
01:47:47.810 --> 01:47:49.670
<v 0>It's stupid.
I want to do that.
Do you,</v>

1769
01:47:49.890 --> 01:47:54.000
do you worry that things like this that you're talking about like the visceral

1770
01:47:54.001 --> 01:47:58.410
experience of driving a car or being missed by a lot of people and that like the

1771
01:47:58.411 --> 01:48:00.300
manual transmission will die off?

1772
01:48:00.450 --> 01:48:03.480
I'm really happy that like that the Camaro still have it.

1773
01:48:03.481 --> 01:48:06.300
The Mustang still have with the corvette.
Still have the Viber still hasn't,

1774
01:48:06.540 --> 01:48:09.020
but I'm really sad when he see,
uh,
uh,

1775
01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:13.200
going to get into like a Porsche and their only button as a drive button and you

1776
01:48:13.201 --> 01:48:14.550
got like,
oh,
okay,
I can,

1777
01:48:14.850 --> 01:48:18.750
I can either shift with this or I can shift with these things and just press one

1778
01:48:18.751 --> 01:48:22.110
foot,
just one foot.
Hmm.
Okay.
Well then I'm not as involved.

1779
01:48:22.140 --> 01:48:25.700
I would like to be involved.
Good at the,
at the teacher.

1780
01:48:25.710 --> 01:48:29.820
You do all of it or let me do well,
did this shifting thing.

1781
01:48:29.821 --> 01:48:34.821
The problem with taking it out of the mix is I don't need it to go that fast.

1782
01:48:35.211 --> 01:48:36.960
Right?
Like it's already going fast.
Right?

1783
01:48:36.970 --> 01:48:40.740
Like it doesn't need to go one 100th of a second faster because you can shift

1784
01:48:40.741 --> 01:48:44.150
the gears for me.
I would like to do that.
Please write tube,
dude.
Yeah.

1785
01:48:44.380 --> 01:48:48.100
<v 2>This one went around the Nurburgring four seconds faster than the other one,</v>

1786
01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:52.550
right.
You know that.
But is it a big marketing thing?
You,

1787
01:48:52.580 --> 01:48:55.780
when I say who cares because we're fucking normal man.

1788
01:48:56.570 --> 01:48:57.830
The people that's a combo.

1789
01:48:58.660 --> 01:49:03.080
<v 0>These fucking cars do they,
they can't fucking drive.
Right.
It's true.</v>

1790
01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:06.680
Some of them can't.
And some of them you certainly can't.
And you know the other,

1791
01:49:06.681 --> 01:49:09.530
the other issue is it's what is what is really fun.

1792
01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:13.580
And with a lot of these cars it's not nearly as fun and you have to drive faster

1793
01:49:13.581 --> 01:49:18.581
to make it more fun cause there's not that visceral connection to the driver

1794
01:49:18.710 --> 01:49:21.300
experience.
Sure.
Like your Prius.

1795
01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:26.030
I like having that mechanical connection.
The clutch pedal makes a difference.

1796
01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:30.750
It's a fun experience.
And I think,
like we said earlier,
we,

1797
01:49:30.751 --> 01:49:34.130
you liken it to a ride cause that's really what it's like.
You know what I mean?

1798
01:49:34.131 --> 01:49:36.680
And then when you're seeing a guy like Chris Harris has going around a corner,

1799
01:49:36.681 --> 01:49:39.560
to me that's not much different than a skateboard.
That does awesome tricks.

1800
01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.710
You know what I'm seeing some dude's just letting it hang out there.

1801
01:49:42.711 --> 01:49:47.260
Who's awesome.
She's awesome at it.
And he's like Tanner files,
driver showers,

1802
01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:48.220
you know,
people

1803
01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:51.590
<v 1>talk,
you know,
all day it's like,
oh you fucking suck.
Compared to Chris Harris.</v>

1804
01:49:52.130 --> 01:49:56.050
I'm sorry if I'm not insane.
And in a foreign country,
like what do you mean?

1805
01:49:56.110 --> 01:49:58.000
That's not your thing?
I mean,
your thing is,

1806
01:49:58.001 --> 01:50:01.300
I'm a regular guy and here's what it's like to drive these ridiculous,

1807
01:50:02.140 --> 01:50:05.740
I pull the kid in the candy store.
You know when you're British,

1808
01:50:05.980 --> 01:50:10.980
then you're expected to drive sports cars and be the most l and steal our women.

1809
01:50:11.230 --> 01:50:15.040
Well,
you're much smarter.
You know,
you're clearly more,

1810
01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:19.540
more likely to be a representative of a company.
30 Iq points.
Yeah.

1811
01:50:19.790 --> 01:50:23.020
You would be a better commercial spokesperson for a bank.

1812
01:50:23.050 --> 01:50:26.380
Really have a British accent hotter if you're a chick.
Yeah.

1813
01:50:26.381 --> 01:50:30.220
There's something extra there or a dude.
Every time I go on my British friends,

1814
01:50:30.221 --> 01:50:33.550
I'm like,
you fucks her all cheating.
This is,
you're not smart.

1815
01:50:33.790 --> 01:50:36.410
You don't have anything to offer,
but Eto nef and that's it.
Hold on.

1816
01:50:36.710 --> 01:50:39.280
It's right away.
Everybody's excited about them.

1817
01:50:39.650 --> 01:50:43.380
It's different what his parents were in colony.

1818
01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:45.610
He pulls the hose like crazy.

1819
01:50:45.611 --> 01:50:49.360
It's unbelievable being something different than their parents or something

1820
01:50:49.361 --> 01:50:51.090
exotic,
something serious.

1821
01:50:51.330 --> 01:50:55.180
They're the farthest she could break away from our desk.
Fuck you.
That's it.

1822
01:50:55.181 --> 01:50:57.760
Other than a black guy,
you're the little,
the second less dangerous.

1823
01:50:58.140 --> 01:51:02.060
You're like right next door if you have a British [inaudible].

1824
01:51:03.730 --> 01:51:07.670
Have you ever gotten,
if you've ever had gotten laid because of a car?
No.

1825
01:51:07.690 --> 01:51:12.340
Me Either.
All I get asked every day,
what car do I use to get chicks?
I'm like,

1826
01:51:12.430 --> 01:51:15.300
you better change your fucking angle,
homie.
Yeah.

1827
01:51:15.310 --> 01:51:16.900
You've met a develop your life son.

1828
01:51:16.930 --> 01:51:20.860
My car's getting me like unwanted teenage boy attention.
Pretty much.

1829
01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:26.950
Yeah.
Well the cars that we like or like I pulled up,

1830
01:51:26.951 --> 01:51:29.560
I saw your corvette,
you have this custom core,

1831
01:51:29.561 --> 01:51:34.561
but it looks like it's a early two thousands maybe in [inaudible] 98.

1832
01:51:34.780 --> 01:51:38.650
Wow.
It's,
it's done.
I've racing seats and you know,

1833
01:51:38.710 --> 01:51:43.300
fat tires on it.
And he changed the headlights so they don't pop up anymore.

1834
01:51:43.750 --> 01:51:48.730
And I like,
for me,
I look at sometime ago UE,
Debbie furniture,
you should try it.

1835
01:51:48.740 --> 01:51:51.730
You like it?
It's 2,900 pounds.

1836
01:51:51.731 --> 01:51:55.710
It's 500 horsepower coil overs and 14 inch brakes.

1837
01:51:55.990 --> 01:52:00.670
Very sticky tires.
Must be ridiculous.
It's so fun.
But to a check,
they'd be like,

1838
01:52:00.671 --> 01:52:04.990
what is this?
Uh,
I you want me to get in that car?

1839
01:52:05.050 --> 01:52:08.830
I picked up a chick once in that car at a bar and we went out.

1840
01:52:08.831 --> 01:52:12.130
We went into the bar and was the sound of the badly no.
Then it ends,

1841
01:52:12.131 --> 01:52:16.330
well actually she gets in the car and I assume you've been in a corvette at

1842
01:52:16.331 --> 01:52:17.290
least once in your life.

1843
01:52:17.650 --> 01:52:21.790
Well it says corvette across the dashboard right across the passenger

1844
01:52:21.791 --> 01:52:24.160
compartment.
She gets in the car,
looks around.

1845
01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:28.060
I'm like putting the harnesses on her cause it's got five point harnesses and

1846
01:52:28.061 --> 01:52:32.170
she goes,
oh my God.
Like I can't believe you drive a Ferrari.

1847
01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:35.500
And I,
and I'm just like yeah man.

1848
01:52:35.501 --> 01:52:37.930
You know the maintenance is really a pitch.

1849
01:52:39.790 --> 01:52:43.120
Is that a good sign though for the rest of the night?
Yeah,
I convert.

1850
01:52:43.130 --> 01:52:45.110
If you wanted to make a really stupid kid,

1851
01:52:46.430 --> 01:52:49.910
<v 0>I was able to convert that one.
Yeah.
Cause intelligence comes from the mom.
Yeah.</v>

1852
01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:53.540
Yeah.
Thankfully.
Does it,
do they know that for sure?
I don't know.

1853
01:52:53.541 --> 01:52:54.690
That's probably one of them.

1854
01:52:55.060 --> 01:52:57.680
How did they try to pretend that we did that and we should pursue that on

1855
01:52:57.681 --> 01:53:01.100
questions?
Everything.
I don't think that's an old watch.
Straight Shit.

1856
01:53:01.310 --> 01:53:04.770
Intelligence varies inside the family.
I mean,
how can you mean?

1857
01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Who the hell knows who's getting the good dose of what it's all chance until

1858
01:53:10.101 --> 01:53:13.730
they dial that shit in?
Yeah,
intelligent varies inside of a family.

1859
01:53:13.910 --> 01:53:17.540
We've all seen the dude's whose brother is like wicked smart and your friends

1860
01:53:17.541 --> 01:53:20.450
dumb.
You're like,
what the fuck man?
Why is your brother so smart?

1861
01:53:21.300 --> 01:53:24.200
We got for you and you're just stupid as shit.

1862
01:53:24.530 --> 01:53:28.190
I know people who've got their APP for sure.
Add Valerie's,
man,

1863
01:53:28.430 --> 01:53:30.920
I hope I didn't get the crap.
I don't know how many,

1864
01:53:30.921 --> 01:53:34.340
how many brothers and sisters?
The key to life is,
don't worry about it.

1865
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:38.900
Actually my sister's like me,
but for cosmetics,

1866
01:53:40.610 --> 01:53:44.690
cosmetics,
a guru of like cosmetics,
Alexis and daily glow.com there we go.

1867
01:53:44.700 --> 01:53:47.380
That's daily glow.com it's my sisters.

1868
01:53:47.990 --> 01:53:51.860
We do get girls that listen to this and they would want to support.
It's nice to,

1869
01:53:51.861 --> 01:53:53.450
it's nice to throw a tossed your system.

1870
01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:57.290
What percent of [inaudible] wrong with that?
Along with that,

1871
01:53:57.820 --> 01:54:01.070
I'm admiring that.
That's what percentage female listeners that you really,

1872
01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:04.790
probably a less than one.
Yeah,
I know this girl,

1873
01:54:05.350 --> 01:54:08.750
angry lesbians,
the ones that I have,
they're all lesbians.
It'll punch you.

1874
01:54:08.840 --> 01:54:12.260
Are they looking to hate you?
No,
I'm just kidding.
We get,
there's a lot of,

1875
01:54:12.290 --> 01:54:16.390
my ex does derby.
The Ian's probably nowhere.
There's a lot.

1876
01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:21.300
I think for some,
some girls they,
they love hearing what guys really think.
Yeah,

1877
01:54:22.490 --> 01:54:26.180
but not even masochistic.
I'm not sadistic or masochistic.

1878
01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:29.420
Unfiltered.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,

1879
01:54:29.421 --> 01:54:34.421
it's also being a male and honest male as opposed to this weird situation where

1880
01:54:35.001 --> 01:54:36.890
a lot of us find ourselves in where we have to work,

1881
01:54:36.891 --> 01:54:41.330
corporate jobs where we were really forced to behave it completely different
way.

1882
01:54:41.331 --> 01:54:44.450
Contrary to nature for eight hours a day.
And Alan Alda,

1883
01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:48.650
it's not your fault in life that that kind of life can beat you.

1884
01:54:48.740 --> 01:54:51.680
And so how do you hear people talking?
Shit take,

1885
01:54:51.681 --> 01:54:55.460
what do you turn into corporate Joe Rogan?
Well,
if you have to,

1886
01:54:55.490 --> 01:54:57.800
what does that even mean?
I don't even know what that means.
Well,

1887
01:54:57.801 --> 01:55:00.530
because when you do your fucking live reads and shit,

1888
01:55:00.531 --> 01:55:04.910
it seems like you're intentionally rolling your eyes.
No,
no.
With this on this.

1889
01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:09.450
Oh,
with that stuff because that's all know,
those are not corporate.

1890
01:55:09.540 --> 01:55:14.540
But those are to me is shit that I would use and companies that are nice and

1891
01:55:15.141 --> 01:55:18.500
they don't give me a hard time about the way I do the commercials all fucked up.

1892
01:55:18.770 --> 01:55:20.720
So what's the fear factor?

1893
01:55:21.070 --> 01:55:23.360
That was probably the most corporate thing that I ever had to do.

1894
01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:25.860
I guess you would call that corporate,
but you know,
it was,

1895
01:55:26.490 --> 01:55:31.200
it was without a doubt the most centered mainstream.
Well,

1896
01:55:31.201 --> 01:55:36.050
did you try,
did you try and,
you know,
get either not sneaking material,

1897
01:55:36.051 --> 01:55:37.730
but it was their interaction,

1898
01:55:37.731 --> 01:55:40.250
a lot of interactions that happen on fear factor that got hacked out later

1899
01:55:40.251 --> 01:55:43.560
because of course there's so much time it,

1900
01:55:43.670 --> 01:55:46.560
that's the thing we're running into with this questions.
Everything showed too,

1901
01:55:46.830 --> 01:55:50.910
is there so much time that gets chopped down to 44 minutes?

1902
01:55:50.970 --> 01:55:54.330
That's what it is with commercials.
And there was a lot of cool moments,
you know,

1903
01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:59.400
fear factor like that.
Uh,
I'm sure it got left in the editing floor to like,

1904
01:55:59.430 --> 01:56:03.060
you know,
people,
uh,
getting through things.
We couldn't show the whole thing.

1905
01:56:03.060 --> 01:56:04.110
You know,
there's a,

1906
01:56:04.490 --> 01:56:08.100
that this was a stupid show and a lot of ways,

1907
01:56:08.101 --> 01:56:12.960
but there was some like really to this day,
some crazy inspirational moments.

1908
01:56:13.230 --> 01:56:18.230
This is one show with his mother and daughter team beat this Douchey Dad and son

1909
01:56:18.691 --> 01:56:22.200
team and the dad and son team were sound like,
I shouldn't say douchey.

1910
01:56:22.230 --> 01:56:23.820
They were just being men,
you know,

1911
01:56:23.821 --> 01:56:26.400
and they were being men who are competing and they were,
you know,

1912
01:56:26.401 --> 01:56:29.770
they get their little cunty,
which is what people do when they're,
you know,

1913
01:56:29.790 --> 01:56:31.530
trying to win a competition.

1914
01:56:31.531 --> 01:56:35.730
They tend to talk shit at her special cameras everywhere,
especially men.
Men,

1915
01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:38.310
men are terrible.
Gotcha.
And so these guys,

1916
01:56:38.311 --> 01:56:40.440
everybody assumed because it was a very physical stunt,

1917
01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:42.300
everybody assumed that the father and son,

1918
01:56:42.301 --> 01:56:44.280
we're going to win because they had a physical advantage,

1919
01:56:44.580 --> 01:56:49.380
but they fucked up and they,
when they fucked up,
they fucked up hard.

1920
01:56:49.381 --> 01:56:53.130
Like it was a big fuck up and the Sun fucked up and the dad fucked up.

1921
01:56:53.131 --> 01:56:57.870
They both fucked up.
It was a big deal.
Wow.
And then this chick and her daughter,

1922
01:56:58.620 --> 01:57:03.330
they,
they won and started crying and the whole,

1923
01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:04.130
like the,
the

1924
01:57:04.130 --> 01:57:08.650
<v 2>can't remember crying.
I was crying.
Is there,
and there's this fear factor.</v>

1925
01:57:08.810 --> 01:57:13.090
No,
no.
There's the people that were working in a straight up,
no,
no,
no,

1926
01:57:13.100 --> 01:57:17.690
it wasn't an in studio was vocations dock near the ocean.

1927
01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:21.560
That's pure.
Yeah.
I think the camera and were crying.
The producers are crying.

1928
01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:26.140
It's a real reaction.
That's not stupid.
Healing hands.
Yeah.

1929
01:57:26.270 --> 01:57:30.020
So I,
it was a lot of stupid shit,
but I saw stuff like that too.

1930
01:57:30.170 --> 01:57:33.920
But you know that that show was honest.
It wasn't pretending to be anything.

1931
01:57:33.921 --> 01:57:37.730
It wasn't so like I love that show because it was like,
hey,

1932
01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:39.140
you're going to do some crazy shit.

1933
01:57:39.170 --> 01:57:42.240
You might eat some crazy shit and we're all having fun and somebody's going to

1934
01:57:42.241 --> 01:57:43.074
win some money.

1935
01:57:43.750 --> 01:57:43.991
<v 0>You know,</v>

1936
01:57:43.991 --> 01:57:46.330
the people that worked on that show with the nicest fucking humans that have

1937
01:57:46.331 --> 01:57:49.630
ever lived there was so nice.
Like the p the behind the scenes people.

1938
01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:54.130
Everybody's so nice.
I was like,
that's yours.
It wasn't fake.

1939
01:57:54.690 --> 01:57:55.170
<v 2>I had a,</v>

1940
01:57:55.170 --> 01:57:59.040
I had a fucking shit experience on TV last time and it was because it was,

1941
01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:04.260
the fake is fucking shit and you can have no
speed as a whole.

1942
01:58:04.261 --> 01:58:07.740
I don't even,
I don't.
I'll probably get,
I'll probably never get hard again.
No.

1943
01:58:07.780 --> 01:58:12.330
How about I love Dan Neil and I love John Sally.
Did you ever read Dan Neil?

1944
01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:13.530
Is that he was in the,

1945
01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:17.340
he was an automotive writer for the La Times and now with the Wall Street

1946
01:58:17.340 --> 01:58:20.910
Journal,
first guy to win a Pulitzer.
He's wrote about cars.
Hilarious.

1947
01:58:21.540 --> 01:58:24.180
A genius writer.
Hilarious,
weird guy.

1948
01:58:24.181 --> 01:58:27.450
He left La to go to the Wall Street Journal and he's super,

1949
01:58:27.451 --> 01:58:30.720
he's from North Carolina,
but put them on to light for the first time,
you know,

1950
01:58:30.721 --> 01:58:35.640
high society type kind of these tickets.
Wired Science.

1951
01:58:35.670 --> 01:58:40.050
I did a show for PBS,
a pilot,
wired magazine,
a weekly.

1952
01:58:40.051 --> 01:58:44.180
It was designed to be a weekly 60 minutes of science.
It was,
you know,

1953
01:58:44.260 --> 01:58:47.900
one of those great disappointment that it didn't work words but you'd never was.

1954
01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:51.760
That's the huge fucking words.
He's a smart motherfucker and he was hilarious,

1955
01:58:51.790 --> 01:58:53.590
but I didn't use him for cars.

1956
01:58:53.890 --> 01:58:58.890
We dove this underwater habitat that the national oceanographic and Atmospheric

1957
01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:03.160
Administration has 60 feet beneath the surface of the ocean off of key Largo.

1958
01:59:03.190 --> 01:59:04.360
It was so cool.

1959
01:59:04.520 --> 01:59:08.320
He's every time I astronauts train them on our podcast cause he always comes up

1960
01:59:08.321 --> 01:59:12.560
with fucking gold.
He's just in one or two beverages.
He is the fucking greatest.

1961
01:59:12.561 --> 01:59:16.570
So you would like him.
He was hilarious and John and Sally who was the greatest.

1962
01:59:16.571 --> 01:59:19.390
It's a lot of characters in the world of journalism,
that's for sure.

1963
01:59:20.410 --> 01:59:23.170
One of the cool things about car journalism today is that you're getting these

1964
01:59:23.171 --> 01:59:25.810
characters that a leak over in a car journalism as well.

1965
01:59:26.410 --> 01:59:30.480
I don't think they were there for a long time.
Right.
I fell into it like I,

1966
01:59:30.640 --> 01:59:33.090
people ask me everyday how I got my job.
It's,

1967
01:59:33.100 --> 01:59:37.600
it was the craziest series of accidents.
It was like when I was a kid,

1968
01:59:38.140 --> 01:59:39.960
I always knew I wanted to do something with cars.

1969
01:59:39.961 --> 01:59:42.310
I was obsessed with it and then like,
but I was like,

1970
01:59:42.311 --> 01:59:45.670
nobody makes any money doing that shit.
So you know,
and uh,

1971
01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:50.530
I tried to become a photographer,
didn't work out,
try to do graphic design,

1972
01:59:50.531 --> 01:59:51.041
didn't work out.

1973
01:59:51.041 --> 01:59:55.330
And then it was like I found the job opening at an exotic car rental company and

1974
01:59:55.331 --> 01:59:59.860
I left that and opened the car wash like anything I could do to be around cars.

1975
02:00:00.280 --> 02:00:03.100
And I started a driving club and I was like,

1976
02:00:03.130 --> 02:00:05.770
I thought it was an added bonus to our members.

1977
02:00:05.771 --> 02:00:09.050
We should probably make videos of the drives we went on.
They would love,

1978
02:00:09.080 --> 02:00:10.240
these are ego people.

1979
02:00:10.630 --> 02:00:14.110
So I hired this kid at a college who was like crazy cause he would hang out on

1980
02:00:14.111 --> 02:00:18.020
my vet at like 150 miles an hour.
So we hired him,

1981
02:00:18.050 --> 02:00:21.040
we start making these videos.
After the third or fourth video,

1982
02:00:21.041 --> 02:00:22.840
the guy came when he came home with a microphone,

1983
02:00:22.841 --> 02:00:25.630
like a news anchor microphone is like here,
host the video.

1984
02:00:26.080 --> 02:00:27.250
And I hosted the video.

1985
02:00:27.670 --> 02:00:32.640
Not One week later a guy called me and goes,
do you want a job?
And,

1986
02:00:32.890 --> 02:00:36.430
and it was like,
it was a matter of he brought the microphone home.

1987
02:00:36.431 --> 02:00:41.300
My Dad and I was a car journalist.
The next fucking week was that a meal.

1988
02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:43.930
So when people ask me all the time like,
how do I get your job?

1989
02:00:43.931 --> 02:00:46.150
Like the answer is just like be me.

1990
02:00:46.720 --> 02:00:49.660
And then I don't know what the fuck else to tell you.

1991
02:00:49.870 --> 02:00:51.460
Just sort of the doors just opened.

1992
02:00:51.490 --> 02:00:55.980
The flood gate opened immediately and out of nowhere.
And it was a cool,
weird

1993
02:00:56.280 --> 02:00:56.700
<v 0>man.</v>

1994
02:00:56.700 --> 02:01:01.700
It's a cool gay because like there's always gonna be someone who like car guys

1995
02:01:03.301 --> 02:01:05.630
love to watch videos on cars.
You know,

1996
02:01:05.720 --> 02:01:08.820
I like even cars I know I'm never going to buy right now.
Don't even considering,

1997
02:01:09.150 --> 02:01:13.650
you know,
I,
I love,
I love just watching.
You're just curious.
I love,

1998
02:01:14.190 --> 02:01:16.450
I love the designs of them.
I loved the,

1999
02:01:16.451 --> 02:01:21.451
the whole idea of the changing of the engines and the lower this and move that

2000
02:01:21.511 --> 02:01:23.480
and move the engine forward and move.
You know,

2001
02:01:23.570 --> 02:01:27.360
I loved the improvements on things.
I think fascinated by it.

2002
02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:31.300
<v 2>When make films,
it's not just about the car.
I mean all of them.</v>

2003
02:01:31.301 --> 02:01:36.301
Everyone on my crew and like I wouldn't be anywhere without the very five Tom

2004
02:01:38.140 --> 02:01:40.190
Zak Fed Nino,
you know fucking yeah,

2005
02:01:40.460 --> 02:01:44.360
<v 1>I wouldn't be anywhere without those people who actually make the films look</v>

2006
02:01:44.450 --> 02:01:48.020
pretty and everyone has a background in photography or video.

2007
02:01:48.040 --> 02:01:50.300
You can tell it's all really well shot and we take,

2008
02:01:50.301 --> 02:01:53.780
we really take pride in that and like even though it's like dumb youtube videos,

2009
02:01:54.020 --> 02:01:58.880
like we shoot with like $100,000 worth of camera gear can youtube video,

2010
02:01:58.881 --> 02:02:00.440
there's no dumb youtube videos.

2011
02:02:00.441 --> 02:02:02.960
Once they get into the thousands and thousands of views,

2012
02:02:03.170 --> 02:02:06.920
you start once it essentially it's just a show that is distributed in a

2013
02:02:06.921 --> 02:02:09.590
different way.
Yeah,
we make it like TV,

2014
02:02:09.620 --> 02:02:13.490
which I think the distinction is kind of silly at this point because the merging

2015
02:02:13.491 --> 02:02:14.630
of technology,

2016
02:02:14.631 --> 02:02:19.160
the merging of television and the Internet is so inevitable that a show's a show

2017
02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:22.550
and if you pull it off on the internet,
it's really cool.
Good for you.

2018
02:02:22.551 --> 02:02:26.510
If you pull it off on TV and it's really cool.
Good for you.
It's just a show.

2019
02:02:26.570 --> 02:02:29.600
But the Internet still enough of the wild west that we're having.

2020
02:02:29.601 --> 02:02:32.510
You know what I mean?
I don't have to answer some fucking a suit.

2021
02:02:32.540 --> 02:02:33.291
That's why it's good.

2022
02:02:33.291 --> 02:02:36.290
Who thinks he knows more than me about how to make a car video.

2023
02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:38.120
That's why it's good.
Fucking pisses me off.

2024
02:02:38.510 --> 02:02:42.230
It should ever want to listen to anyone tell me how to make a car video.

2025
02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:45.650
Fuck you.
Shit you off.
You know why?

2026
02:02:45.651 --> 02:02:49.580
Because you're an interesting guy and nobody knows how to tell you to be you.

2027
02:02:49.760 --> 02:02:54.230
You're a fun guy and in people want to hear you talk about a car.

2028
02:02:54.231 --> 02:02:58.070
Like it's a fun thing to see you running through the gear like that,
that video,

2029
02:02:58.071 --> 02:03:01.340
that Porsche video,
that Bvi Porsche video.
Watch that at least four times.

2030
02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:05.050
Terrific.
I may take 12 cents off that thing

2031
02:03:06.620 --> 02:03:11.080
just on Joe.
This BBI cat.
What's his name?
What's his Joe.
Joey.
Joey.

2032
02:03:11.450 --> 02:03:13.790
Joey Seely,
one of the Co owners of Bbi auto sport.

2033
02:03:13.791 --> 02:03:17.600
I'm just going to keep doing it.
Yeah,
go ahead.
Takes this.
Um,

2034
02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:22.340
1985 Porsche and he turns it into this insane car.

2035
02:03:22.490 --> 02:03:27.020
He cuts out everything.
There's no floor board when there's no um,
uh,
mats.

2036
02:03:27.230 --> 02:03:31.610
Floormates,
no ins sound installation,
no carpet.
It's got like stripped.
Yeah.

2037
02:03:31.611 --> 02:03:36.590
This like little aluminum shifter.
It's like he's no radio,

2038
02:03:37.070 --> 02:03:41.420
no air conditioning.
40,000 miles on it.
Wow.
Chassis.
That crazy.

2039
02:03:41.421 --> 02:03:42.081
It's amazing.

2040
02:03:42.081 --> 02:03:46.430
And it's rock that the galvanize Porsche bodies from the eighties and nineties,

2041
02:03:46.431 --> 02:03:50.780
like,
like good medic.
Todd's Porsche.
It's going to last forever.
Wow.
You know,

2042
02:03:51.050 --> 02:03:53.660
I believe it and you have to let me take you down there.

2043
02:03:53.670 --> 02:03:56.000
I gotta I gotta take you down there and you've got to drive a couple of their

2044
02:03:56.001 --> 02:03:58.280
cars cause they build the craziest shit.
Yeah,

2045
02:03:58.281 --> 02:04:01.430
I've seen a couple of your videos on it.
The one with the a nine,

2046
02:04:01.500 --> 02:04:05.390
911 turbo s 10,
Oh quarter mile.

2047
02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:11.570
They took a nine,
911 turbo s and they were like not fast enough.
Let's,
let's,

2048
02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:14.840
let's Jack it up to more than 600 horsepower.

2049
02:04:14.870 --> 02:04:18.080
So that guy who has that nine,
nine,
seven,
is this the,
oh,

2050
02:04:18.081 --> 02:04:20.980
there's the video right there.
So this guy,
the guy who owns this car,

2051
02:04:20.981 --> 02:04:23.960
his name is Eric,
and his gray car is terrifying.

2052
02:04:24.180 --> 02:04:27.380
She has about 40,000 miles on this car.

2053
02:04:27.381 --> 02:04:30.980
It says daily driver and it's dual clutch,
right?
That,

2054
02:04:30.990 --> 02:04:35.630
so it's got launched control.
He launches this car every single day.

2055
02:04:35.860 --> 02:04:38.100
Sweet shot.
Every single day.
He's on

2056
02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:42.900
<v 2>the car.
He launches the fucking car.
I launched it 10 times in a row.
Wow.</v>

2057
02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:46.260
No problems.
PDK is the nastiest dual clutch transmission.

2058
02:04:46.261 --> 02:04:49.570
You can beat the fucking hell out of the car.
They'll take it.
Yeah.

2059
02:04:49.620 --> 02:04:53.190
Do you remember when the Nissan gtrs first came out and everybody was launched

2060
02:04:53.191 --> 02:04:56.970
controlling them?
When they're blowing,
you would,
you would hear like,
well,

2061
02:04:56.971 --> 02:05:00.690
if you did it once,
you'll avoid you void your warranty.
Well,
why is it there?

2062
02:05:00.710 --> 02:05:03.970
Yeah,
you advertise this shit.
I put it on the car.

2063
02:05:03.971 --> 02:05:07.790
How many times where you're allowed to do it?
Well,
none.
None.
No,
none.

2064
02:05:08.860 --> 02:05:12.180
No.
Forget,
forget.
Not even use the logic.
You,

2065
02:05:12.181 --> 02:05:17.130
if you put it in launch control mode and never launched it,
you're done.

2066
02:05:17.340 --> 02:05:21.210
That is so funny that it's so funny.
You violate your warranty.

2067
02:05:21.260 --> 02:05:24.810
I very strongly voided someone's warranty doing that.
Actually,

2068
02:05:25.410 --> 02:05:29.070
I personally avoided someone's on purpose.
Yeah,
we,
we,

2069
02:05:29.100 --> 02:05:33.300
we took a Nissan Gtr to the drag strip and we rented one of those a Z,

2070
02:05:33.301 --> 02:05:38.301
h z Corvettes from hertz yellow and black ones and we put a fucking 200 shot dry

2071
02:05:39.721 --> 02:05:42.570
fog on it.
We sprayed the rental car.

2072
02:05:43.320 --> 02:05:46.620
I remember I watched that Truss,
the carbon on nitrogen.

2073
02:05:47.050 --> 02:05:49.170
I don't know what the fuck he just said.

2074
02:05:49.690 --> 02:05:54.030
We've got a rental type of stimulant to an automobile.

2075
02:05:54.060 --> 02:05:55.830
How would you describe it and yeah,

2076
02:05:55.860 --> 02:06:00.000
if people don't know what nitric makes the air that goes into the car very,

2077
02:06:00.001 --> 02:06:03.330
very cold and if it runs cold it means it makes more power.

2078
02:06:03.331 --> 02:06:07.650
So you can make a bunch more power basically by hitting a button and spraying

2079
02:06:07.651 --> 02:06:12.540
this gas,
which makes your,
makes you conscious for your engine speed.
Dust.

2080
02:06:13.350 --> 02:06:18.030
Yes and no.
Yes.
I mean no,
no.
Until it is,
you know what I mean?

2081
02:06:18.450 --> 02:06:21.570
You know,
that's a great way to,
you know what I mean?

2082
02:06:21.680 --> 02:06:26.250
Like is it dangerous to have sex with someone with AIDS?
No,
until it is.

2083
02:06:26.490 --> 02:06:29.670
Wow.
I would say yes every time.
I don't know how you give advice.

2084
02:06:30.690 --> 02:06:34.950
I'm a little bit more,
I live dangerous.
Cigarette circumspect.
Yeah,
little ones.

2085
02:06:34.951 --> 02:06:37.530
The video got a million views.
I got a band.
Right.

2086
02:06:37.570 --> 02:06:41.690
Hurts for life or for doing that.
Wow.
They're mad at you.
Well,

2087
02:06:41.700 --> 02:06:44.610
what about Eva Davis?
Give a fuck.
Fortunately we've got enterprise,

2088
02:06:47.250 --> 02:06:50.240
there's a lot of car rental companies.
You can work your way through.
Yeah,

2089
02:06:50.250 --> 02:06:53.830
they must be like,
hey dickhead.
That's not what we rented it for.
Enterprises.

2090
02:06:53.850 --> 02:06:56.370
Minis in every car.
Rental counter in America.

2091
02:06:56.600 --> 02:07:00.810
Now when you read this guy a car,
no matter what,
don't rent them a car.

2092
02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:02.550
So downtime.

2093
02:07:03.690 --> 02:07:07.380
So you want to character when they do.
When?
When?
When you go there,

2094
02:07:07.381 --> 02:07:07.981
like if you went there,

2095
02:07:07.981 --> 02:07:11.430
they would literally tell you you can't rent a car from them.
I think so.

2096
02:07:11.431 --> 02:07:15.750
I mean I got a letter from the vice president of the company saying I was band.

2097
02:07:16.070 --> 02:07:18.750
Do you try to see you?
Yes.
How much do they want?

2098
02:07:18.870 --> 02:07:22.500
They wanted me to buy the car coordinates.
That seems reasonable.

2099
02:07:22.590 --> 02:07:25.590
What was funny was how much they wanted for the car.
How much was it?

2100
02:07:25.680 --> 02:07:27.840
The car was like a year and a half fold.
It's a corvette.

2101
02:07:28.090 --> 02:07:32.370
It was a year and a half old and it had like 10,000 miles on it and they wanted

2102
02:07:32.371 --> 02:07:36.460
to make me buy it for $16,000 which is unbelievably

2103
02:07:36.460 --> 02:07:39.850
<v 1>low.
And then I realized why salvage title,</v>

2104
02:07:41.560 --> 02:07:44.710
they rented me a car that was on a salvage title.

2105
02:07:44.740 --> 02:07:49.740
It already had already been totaled and brought back and they tried to sue me

2106
02:07:50.261 --> 02:07:54.700
into buying it.
Oh my God.
I thought about partying it out.

2107
02:07:54.701 --> 02:07:57.100
Actually I thought about right there.

2108
02:07:57.101 --> 02:08:00.640
Isn't that crazy that they rented you a car that was salvaged and legal?

2109
02:08:01.030 --> 02:08:03.340
It's legal to do.
Well they can.

2110
02:08:03.341 --> 02:08:07.210
They fix things 100% now having driven that car,

2111
02:08:07.211 --> 02:08:11.810
I could tell you it was not 100%
I can tell you that car,

2112
02:08:12.240 --> 02:08:14.760
that car.
Do you in a past life?
I don't know.

2113
02:08:15.190 --> 02:08:18.040
I can only tell you what it did in mine as a storm trooper.

2114
02:08:18.120 --> 02:08:21.640
Probably Nazi Germany could be brought into this life and get abused.

2115
02:08:21.641 --> 02:08:25.190
Like it was a panzer tank hit in an accident and it was a,

2116
02:08:25.200 --> 02:08:28.600
it was a 2009.
Oh,
there's the video.
Look,
there's the corvette.

2117
02:08:28.900 --> 02:08:31.690
Is it 2009 models?
Hello everybody at Hertz.

2118
02:08:31.691 --> 02:08:36.670
I hope you're paying attention to this.
[inaudible] it's too late.
So,
um,

2119
02:08:37.180 --> 02:08:38.170
those cars,

2120
02:08:38.200 --> 02:08:43.200
like they seem a little plasticky to begin with because they're made of plastic.

2121
02:08:43.481 --> 02:08:46.000
When they take a big hit like the can,

2122
02:08:46.001 --> 02:08:51.001
they just bend everything back into position and they kind of explode like

2123
02:08:52.270 --> 02:08:56.730
shattery shattered.
So they replace all the stuff that shattered off.
Yeah.

2124
02:08:57.250 --> 02:09:01.570
Is it like less impact resistant than a regular car?
I mean,

2125
02:09:02.190 --> 02:09:06.680
there were only known for being kind of dangerous.
They're not known like,

2126
02:09:07.020 --> 02:09:08.410
like not a pinto,

2127
02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:13.270
like less people dying them than you think this video is hilarious to.
That's it.

2128
02:09:13.330 --> 02:09:14.910
That's really reassuring.
No car.

2129
02:09:15.010 --> 02:09:18.700
He took a fucking rental car from Hertz and you put a blower in it?

2130
02:09:18.790 --> 02:09:21.900
No nitrate actress in it.
Yeah.
What is it called?
What do you call it?

2131
02:09:23.140 --> 02:09:27.160
What did you call it?
Spray and that's it.
He's spraying it.

2132
02:09:27.940 --> 02:09:31.780
Macular,
I'm sorry,
I fucked up with blower.

2133
02:09:32.140 --> 02:09:33.100
I meant to say spray,

2134
02:09:33.130 --> 02:09:37.660
but the ID of that of just shoving that shit and some phonies.

2135
02:09:37.661 --> 02:09:40.880
Fucking rental car.
A friend of mine [inaudible].

2136
02:09:42.220 --> 02:09:43.540
I love that.
A friend of mine,

2137
02:09:43.940 --> 02:09:46.540
that interest kit that goes into Smith's in a suitcase.

2138
02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:52.180
Bergen is a carry on.
Carry on.
No,
no,

2139
02:09:52.350 --> 02:09:57.190
but you can make it into a rental car.
Supposedly.
Really got us,

2140
02:09:57.250 --> 02:09:58.083
I don't know.

2141
02:09:58.120 --> 02:10:01.090
I wouldn't like assemble and he would sneak it in and then a parking lot.

2142
02:10:01.180 --> 02:10:05.790
I mean allegedly if you were some,
somebody doesn't even exist.
Guy I heard about.

2143
02:10:05.800 --> 02:10:09.680
I don't mind and just slapped that bitch on.
Theoretically.
Yeah.

2144
02:10:09.700 --> 02:10:14.470
How long would it take you to do that?
10 minutes.
10 minutes.
It's just hoses.

2145
02:10:14.471 --> 02:10:17.080
It's only 10 minutes.
You could have nitrous.

2146
02:10:17.110 --> 02:10:21.400
There is a guy who was well known who would fly around the country and rent a

2147
02:10:21.401 --> 02:10:24.040
Ford Taurus at every place.

2148
02:10:24.041 --> 02:10:29.041
He any weekend he would bracket drag race because he knew that valley that that

2149
02:10:29.471 --> 02:10:34.220
Ford Taurus would run a 16 one every time,
no matter the condition.

2150
02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:35.780
<v 2>And he could just fly anywhere,</v>

2151
02:10:35.900 --> 02:10:38.720
show up with a rented car and run the same fucking number.

2152
02:10:38.721 --> 02:10:40.430
Every time it went down a bunch of mouse.

2153
02:10:40.550 --> 02:10:43.090
Was He laying down a bunch of pets and you would make a living off it?

2154
02:10:43.091 --> 02:10:47.270
Cause it's bracket.
So it's price is right.
Rules drag racing.
Wow.

2155
02:10:47.330 --> 02:10:50.030
That's hilarious.
Drag racing to me.

2156
02:10:50.180 --> 02:10:54.500
I never give a fuck about it now.
It seemed to me like,
yeah,
I get it.

2157
02:10:54.501 --> 02:10:58.430
You got there quicker.
Whatever you'd like,
you can try standing mile.
It's fun.

2158
02:10:58.670 --> 02:11:00.740
Well I what?
I'm sure it is fun,

2159
02:11:00.890 --> 02:11:04.760
but what I really enjoy watching his people maneuver for position when people

2160
02:11:04.761 --> 02:11:07.780
were on a track and you know,
and it's a real regular one,
Dan.

2161
02:11:07.790 --> 02:11:10.070
That's where it's really exciting.
And I know that's also,

2162
02:11:10.071 --> 02:11:13.370
words were like fucking Super Dangerous Trillion v eight supercar you ever watch

2163
02:11:13.371 --> 02:11:15.200
any of that shit?
No.
What does that good stuff?

2164
02:11:15.201 --> 02:11:19.250
Because they're driving cars that look like road cars.
Right.
Dot.

2165
02:11:19.251 --> 02:11:22.820
Neath they're more like Nascar's,
but they looked like road cars and it's,

2166
02:11:23.240 --> 02:11:26.570
you know,
Nascar levels of rubbing and bumping,

2167
02:11:26.571 --> 02:11:31.310
but on road courses with left and right turns.
That's amazing.
It's nasty stuff.

2168
02:11:31.311 --> 02:11:35.000
It's really good.
Right?
Where do they do that?
I mean in Australia a lot,

2169
02:11:35.001 --> 02:11:38.720
but they also have overall here they did a circuit of the Americas race I think.

2170
02:11:38.721 --> 02:11:42.170
And they did like a Sonoma race or something.
Um,
they tore,
but it's,

2171
02:11:42.171 --> 02:11:45.990
it's bad ass racing.
It's good stuff.
Wow.
You know what you should do?
I never,

2172
02:11:46.010 --> 02:11:50.210
I'm doing this.
I get wary whenever someone says,
you know what you should do,

2173
02:11:52.920 --> 02:11:55.280
you know,
get me hooked on this new Jang.

2174
02:11:55.310 --> 02:11:58.130
We'll know how much money have you spent?
There's V eight supercar.

2175
02:11:58.430 --> 02:12:02.210
How much money have you spent in your Porsche?
A Lot,
right?
It costs a few bucks.

2176
02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:05.190
Right?
So don't you want to drive it fast?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.

2177
02:12:05.240 --> 02:12:08.960
So September 13th to 15th what is it?

2178
02:12:08.961 --> 02:12:12.110
Silver state classic in Nevada.
Okay.

2179
02:12:12.350 --> 02:12:15.440
They shut down 91 miles of highway right now.

2180
02:12:15.441 --> 02:12:18.440
I never have the time to spend three days somewhere driving your car.
You only,

2181
02:12:18.441 --> 02:12:22.040
it's only one day.
The race,
big races.
Only one day we could do it for one day.

2182
02:12:22.220 --> 02:12:23.360
It's a classic race.

2183
02:12:23.361 --> 02:12:27.980
It's a straight line road race students and 91 miles of highway shutdown.

2184
02:12:28.010 --> 02:12:32.810
And you want to average 150 miles an hour over night.
You know,

2185
02:12:33.670 --> 02:12:34.503
it seems like,

2186
02:12:34.790 --> 02:12:38.000
it seems like it'd be a recipe for driving really fast at a bunch of people who

2187
02:12:38.001 --> 02:12:40.430
don't know that well.
No,
no,
no.
It's not a wheel to wheel race.

2188
02:12:40.431 --> 02:12:43.080
You go off like two minutes at a time.
You're okay.

2189
02:12:43.180 --> 02:12:46.900
You're at a time when you would've fucking road and you're 500 horsepower

2190
02:12:46.910 --> 02:12:49.310
Porsche.
So I'm just driving straight.

2191
02:12:49.820 --> 02:12:53.210
Well it's like eight miles straight and then a turn and then 10 miles straight

2192
02:12:53.211 --> 02:12:55.650
and then it turned and then you know,
but it's 91 miles.
So you,

2193
02:12:55.890 --> 02:12:59.090
you go 91 miles and like 25 minutes I believe.
Yeah.

2194
02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:03.170
It's like New York to Philly in 25 minutes.
Crazy.
Here's the Santa Barbara.

2195
02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:06.890
It sounds very dangerous.
Yeah.
And Fun.
You fight people?

2196
02:13:07.430 --> 02:13:11.630
I don't anymore.
I barely grapple.
You did fight people.
Yeah.

2197
02:13:11.631 --> 02:13:14.480
Only the one only in tournaments and the real world.

2198
02:13:15.020 --> 02:13:18.920
Much more likely to get out of the way.
Just be friendly.

2199
02:13:19.870 --> 02:13:21.350
Right.
Well,

2200
02:13:21.351 --> 02:13:24.860
the same thrill seekers that would love to drive a car like really fast would

2201
02:13:24.861 --> 02:13:29.540
also like to do MMA or motorcross ride or don't want to fight anybody.

2202
02:13:29.690 --> 02:13:32.130
Low driving cars.
You were just

2203
02:13:32.130 --> 02:13:35.530
<v 0>have a different thing.
You know?
It's a different expression of the thrill Jean.</v>

2204
02:13:35.780 --> 02:13:39.570
I know.
I don't know if it's a real thing,
but there's a thing that men,

2205
02:13:39.740 --> 02:13:43.440
I'll have that there's a certain amount of stimulation we seem to have to have

2206
02:13:43.441 --> 02:13:48.030
in our lives for whatever reason.
Yeah.
For whatever reason,

2207
02:13:48.210 --> 02:13:52.300
I don't know what the fuck that is.
Well,
adrenaline's fun driving once again,

2208
02:13:52.350 --> 02:13:55.200
fucking drug man.
It is a great one.
As long as it doesn't get away from you,

2209
02:13:55.300 --> 02:13:56.490
you want to feel alive.

2210
02:13:56.520 --> 02:14:00.990
I mean that's why driving fast as such a kick because it's fascinating when you

2211
02:14:00.991 --> 02:14:03.610
watch adrenaline lock someone up to do.

2212
02:14:03.611 --> 02:14:06.780
Then when you see someone get like completely locked up with adrenaline,

2213
02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:10.050
one of the more fascinating things about fighting is watched people walk to the

2214
02:14:10.051 --> 02:14:13.690
cage and seeing them managing that anticipation there.

2215
02:14:13.691 --> 02:14:16.860
I's like moving around like what's going on in their head and she,
yeah,
yeah.

2216
02:14:16.860 --> 02:14:18.390
I mean different ways of dealing with it.

2217
02:14:18.391 --> 02:14:19.950
Everybody has a sort of a different approach,

2218
02:14:19.951 --> 02:14:24.270
but everyone is experiencing extreme,
a level of adrenaline that adrenaline.

2219
02:14:24.271 --> 02:14:26.430
The experience must be just unbearable.

2220
02:14:26.550 --> 02:14:30.030
I've never done anything as intense as fighting in an MMA bout,

2221
02:14:30.031 --> 02:14:30.990
but the things that I've done,

2222
02:14:30.991 --> 02:14:35.100
it scared the shit out of me and I know that that's even scarier and not some

2223
02:14:35.310 --> 02:14:37.980
adrenaline shit.
I manage it by talking a lot.

2224
02:14:38.580 --> 02:14:41.340
Some people manage it with like silence,
you know what I mean?

2225
02:14:41.341 --> 02:14:44.360
Some people managing with like fucking moving around.

2226
02:14:44.361 --> 02:14:47.230
Whenever I manage it by taught huge surprise.
I manage it by talking a lot,

2227
02:14:47.231 --> 02:14:50.490
but fucking well,
whatever calms you down,
right?
That's the idea.

2228
02:14:51.030 --> 02:14:54.840
Whatever keeps you relaxed.
That's just what's the scariest thing you've done?

2229
02:14:55.440 --> 02:14:59.040
Martial arts competitions for sure.
Yeah.
Stand up second,

2230
02:14:59.100 --> 02:15:01.300
but only in the beginning.
Only in the beginning when,

2231
02:15:01.310 --> 02:15:04.560
when I first did it or the moments that have bombed.
I've had,

2232
02:15:04.770 --> 02:15:09.360
I've had some horrific fucking death defying bottom of the stand up on terrified

2233
02:15:09.361 --> 02:15:13.290
of it.
Man Bombing.
I steal a joke for myself.

2234
02:15:13.291 --> 02:15:15.150
It's like sucking a thousand Dick's in front of your mother.

2235
02:15:15.470 --> 02:15:18.960
It's the most embarrassed a man could ever be in life and I've done it many

2236
02:15:18.961 --> 02:15:22.350
times.
That's horrible.
Yeah,
you'll learn and grow from it.
But yeah,

2237
02:15:22.351 --> 02:15:24.990
you take a fun hobby.
Terrified of it,
man.
I,
when we,

2238
02:15:24.991 --> 02:15:26.640
when I was doing the speed show,
they had,

2239
02:15:26.641 --> 02:15:30.650
would have a comic for inbetween fucking takes like the crowd,
right guy,

2240
02:15:30.660 --> 02:15:30.960
whatever.

2241
02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:35.080
I'm up guide and every once in a while I'd grabbed the mic from him and like

2242
02:15:35.100 --> 02:15:37.920
relieve him because I figured like I'm on the show,

2243
02:15:37.921 --> 02:15:41.310
I get at least hold their attention for five fucking minutes and I would tell

2244
02:15:41.311 --> 02:15:44.880
him to.
Then I got some decent laughs,
but I felt like,

2245
02:15:45.120 --> 02:15:47.550
I felt like that audience was like,
you know,

2246
02:15:47.730 --> 02:15:50.760
I'm scared to go to a random audience and do it well.

2247
02:15:50.790 --> 02:15:52.980
You would just need a different introduction.

2248
02:15:52.981 --> 02:15:55.410
They would need to let them know what you're about.

2249
02:15:55.480 --> 02:15:58.920
And then you could do that through a for a couple of jokes and then they get

2250
02:15:58.921 --> 02:16:02.280
used to whoever you are and then they sort of either accept you or don't.

2251
02:16:02.520 --> 02:16:04.500
It's definitely easier if they know who you are,

2252
02:16:04.520 --> 02:16:07.680
like they know who you are from a show,
from your show,
they're already fans.

2253
02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:08.821
Then it's easy.

2254
02:16:08.821 --> 02:16:11.640
They know your sense of humor cause you express it a lot and a lot of your

2255
02:16:11.641 --> 02:16:15.330
videos,
it will be an easy transition.
Like you could probably do,

2256
02:16:15.480 --> 02:16:17.540
you have a lot of hits on those videos.
You know,

2257
02:16:17.541 --> 02:16:21.470
you could probably do stand up in a place if you wanted to try it.
You know,

2258
02:16:21.480 --> 02:16:22.171
if you wanted to,

2259
02:16:22.171 --> 02:16:26.070
you should go to like an open mic night and then try like a night somewhere,

2260
02:16:26.071 --> 02:16:29.260
have a bunch of professional comedians and then you go up and do like 10
minutes.

2261
02:16:29.470 --> 02:16:31.840
Like Sandwich yourself in with other people that are pros.

2262
02:16:32.050 --> 02:16:33.500
That's scary shit to me.

2263
02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:36.490
Go to an open mic night throws sounds really scary to me.

2264
02:16:36.500 --> 02:16:39.070
You know the good thing about open Mike nights in everyone's socks.

2265
02:16:41.140 --> 02:16:42.280
Yeah,
that's it.

2266
02:16:42.310 --> 02:16:45.850
I think it was Richard Jenny's that said that the good thing about bad comedians

2267
02:16:45.851 --> 02:16:49.700
is it inspires people to try it and I think he's right.
He was.

2268
02:16:50.100 --> 02:16:54.910
He was totally right because that's funny.
When you go to an open mic night,

2269
02:16:54.911 --> 02:16:57.740
you go,
oh,
okay.
It's not like everybody's a Richard Pryor here.
Right.

2270
02:16:58.010 --> 02:17:01.360
This is okay.
This,
yeah.
This is obviously be all right.
I'll be all right.

2271
02:17:01.530 --> 02:17:04.390
I mean very difficult to do really bad comedy and being like,
well,

2272
02:17:04.400 --> 02:17:07.300
I can fucking do better than that guy,
man.
Yeah,
we all have.
Yeah.

2273
02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:09.400
There's no doubt about that.
I'm sure you have,
but I just,

2274
02:17:09.401 --> 02:17:10.240
I feel like there's something,

2275
02:17:10.270 --> 02:17:14.170
there's something different from being funny around people you know,

2276
02:17:14.171 --> 02:17:17.700
and being funny around strangers is a really big difference.
Yeah,

2277
02:17:17.710 --> 02:17:19.060
it's a big difference for sure.

2278
02:17:19.150 --> 02:17:23.260
I'm not sure what it takes to pull it off if I'm actually funny.
Yeah,

2279
02:17:23.410 --> 02:17:26.530
you could do that.
It can be funny.
You could do it.
It just takes focus.

2280
02:17:26.790 --> 02:17:30.040
You would just have to decide that that's who you are.
You're extending comedian,

2281
02:17:30.041 --> 02:17:32.470
then you start riding and working at it and yeah,
you could do it.

2282
02:17:32.500 --> 02:17:34.240
You could totally do it.
You'd probably enjoy it.

2283
02:17:34.510 --> 02:17:37.870
It's probably perfect for your personality.
I'm a decent storyteller.

2284
02:17:37.871 --> 02:17:41.620
I think you tell decent stories on the show.
These are stories.
I have the time.

2285
02:17:41.650 --> 02:17:43.370
Listen,
man,
you could totally do it.
It's,

2286
02:17:43.390 --> 02:17:45.910
it's one of those things where it's not magic.
You know?

2287
02:17:45.911 --> 02:17:48.880
It's not like either have to be seven foot tall.
He can't play basketball.
No,

2288
02:17:48.881 --> 02:17:51.850
it's not that.
It's this.
If you have,
uh,

2289
02:17:52.220 --> 02:17:55.180
an ability to communicate and you have something to say,
you can figure it out.

2290
02:17:55.181 --> 02:17:59.230
In fact,
uh,
a certain amount of self loving doesn't actually help.
Helps a little.

2291
02:17:59.390 --> 02:18:01.510
A little helps learn that from Jim Norton.

2292
02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:04.540
Nothing wrong with that or not having it.
That's okay too.

2293
02:18:04.541 --> 02:18:08.230
It's whoever the fuck you really are.
Yeah.
I do sell flow,
self-loving.

2294
02:18:08.231 --> 02:18:11.850
Nothing wrong with that.
You know,
one of the shows are going to hate myself.
Dude,

2295
02:18:12.370 --> 02:18:17.110
why are you now?
Why now?

2296
02:18:17.111 --> 02:18:19.780
I'm not in that business.
You don't need a shrink me.
It's okay.
It's all,

2297
02:18:19.781 --> 02:18:21.600
it's a problem.
I've always had it fucking well.

2298
02:18:21.610 --> 02:18:24.190
It comes with the growing up being the fact that it happens,
right?

2299
02:18:24.250 --> 02:18:27.570
What are you gonna do?
Yeah,
but you're a different person now and you guys have,

2300
02:18:27.571 --> 02:18:30.700
cause I learned,
I learned that from him.
I learned,
you guys get to make out.

2301
02:18:30.701 --> 02:18:34.110
I'm going to pay the room is full of love and I learned from Jim Norton,

2302
02:18:34.120 --> 02:18:37.030
Opie and Anthony that you can be,
you're going gonna walk away from the love Joe.

2303
02:18:37.120 --> 02:18:37.691
Nothing wrong.

2304
02:18:37.691 --> 02:18:40.780
We can embrace the filth that I've embraced the film and the depth.

2305
02:18:41.500 --> 02:18:44.560
We were talking about that I guess before the podcast itself,

2306
02:18:44.561 --> 02:18:47.800
we're talking about opie and Anthony being one of the reasons why you got into

2307
02:18:47.801 --> 02:18:51.490
it,
that you saw them and you were like,
Holy Shit.
Like I actually,

2308
02:18:51.670 --> 02:18:54.850
I think I could do something.
I used to be so insecure.
Do you know?
I can't.

2309
02:18:54.851 --> 02:18:59.110
I can't.
You wouldn't even believe because I pass off as an extrovert now,

2310
02:18:59.111 --> 02:19:00.220
even though I'm really insecure.

2311
02:19:00.700 --> 02:19:05.620
I was about the properly insecure back in the day until I discovered that you

2312
02:19:05.621 --> 02:19:10.621
can actually say like disgusting things and not old and have people laugh and

2313
02:19:11.201 --> 02:19:14.140
make a living off it.
That was amazing.
Yeah.

2314
02:19:14.141 --> 02:19:17.770
And it was like all Norton Opie and Anthony and Patrice who I got to meet before

2315
02:19:17.771 --> 02:19:19.060
he died.
Fucking thank God.

2316
02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:24.040
I think a lot of people that are involved in the entertainment business or uh,

2317
02:19:24.130 --> 02:19:27.770
at least initially insecure that you kind have to be,

2318
02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:32.990
to want that much tension to put yourself up in front of that many people,

2319
02:19:33.020 --> 02:19:33.801
the you'll,

2320
02:19:33.801 --> 02:19:37.850
you get to a position like that only if you have a deficit in my opinion.

2321
02:19:37.940 --> 02:19:41.330
But there's a difference between an off,
that's all it's doing it and being,

2322
02:19:41.331 --> 02:19:46.000
you know,
in some actors who need,
who needed the attention.
Right.
Yeah.

2323
02:19:46.020 --> 02:19:50.820
Well Guy Knew Anna Paquin when we were like 18,
19.
Wow.
That was interesting.

2324
02:19:51.680 --> 02:19:55.190
My Friend Day at school and not sure mushrooms for the first time ever.

2325
02:19:55.220 --> 02:19:57.620
I'm not sure who that was.
Untrue blood.
Oh,
okay.

2326
02:19:57.621 --> 02:20:01.490
I never watched won an Oscar at 12 actress.
So this really amazing,

2327
02:20:01.510 --> 02:20:04.190
when we were 19,
I gave her mushrooms for the first time.

2328
02:20:04.420 --> 02:20:08.240
It allegedly pretending she was fibbing.

2329
02:20:08.241 --> 02:20:09.470
You heard of lol?

2330
02:20:09.471 --> 02:20:13.600
Worry about how well I sort of statute of limitations the nation.

2331
02:20:13.680 --> 02:20:17.750
I don't think so.
Not In this day and age.
The NDA.
See Wpp,

2332
02:20:18.050 --> 02:20:20.660
the um,
I think in this day and age,

2333
02:20:22.700 --> 02:20:26.110
this is one of the,
uh,
I think this is one of the weirdest times to,

2334
02:20:26.140 --> 02:20:30.620
to grow up and uh,
to know that mushrooms are still illegal.
If you're illegal,

2335
02:20:30.621 --> 02:20:31.520
if you're listening to this,

2336
02:20:31.850 --> 02:20:34.490
if you're in high school or if you're in college and you know,
you,

2337
02:20:34.491 --> 02:20:38.000
you find out about what's legal and what's illegal and how it got there,

2338
02:20:38.440 --> 02:20:40.430
there's a,
that's the bullshit tipping point.

2339
02:20:40.520 --> 02:20:43.190
That's the tipping point where you realize where you look at things and you go,

2340
02:20:43.191 --> 02:20:46.690
wait a minute,
what are they doing?
This makes no sense.
Hold on.
What?

2341
02:20:46.760 --> 02:20:50.540
Schedule One and you find out scheduled one is marijuana.

2342
02:20:50.541 --> 02:20:52.100
Marijuana has no medicinal value.

2343
02:20:52.101 --> 02:20:55.760
And then you'd like just see all these people that have emphysema or glaucoma or

2344
02:20:55.761 --> 02:20:59.270
what aids,
whatever the fuck they have.
I have,
I've had two back surgeries.

2345
02:20:59.271 --> 02:21:02.720
Cancer's me straight up.
It helps people.
It helps people relax.

2346
02:21:02.990 --> 02:21:07.400
But then you see this shit that scheduled too.
It's scheduled to his cocaine.

2347
02:21:07.580 --> 02:21:11.060
Heroin,
heroin and cocaine have medicinal value,

2348
02:21:11.210 --> 02:21:15.110
which is when did they have medicinal value in like 1905.
No,

2349
02:21:15.111 --> 02:21:18.320
they still in opiates like for pills for oxycontin.

2350
02:21:18.321 --> 02:21:21.660
That's when they figured out it was good and I'm Methadone in the,

2351
02:21:21.700 --> 02:21:26.060
in the right circumstances.
Those are really helpful.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2352
02:21:26.061 --> 02:21:29.960
Medical cocaine is a real thing that you really do use that photo stream.

2353
02:21:30.230 --> 02:21:34.370
They use it for something.
I know line of Cain is like the gay cousin of cocaine.

2354
02:21:34.730 --> 02:21:38.030
That's a type of uh,
it's like cocaine.
She's different.

2355
02:21:38.060 --> 02:21:42.560
It's just different guys thing.
What happens when they married?
Um,
they,
they just,

2356
02:21:42.590 --> 02:21:45.230
they married inside your nose when you do surgery on it.

2357
02:21:45.920 --> 02:21:48.800
That's a lot of canes for,
they numb you.
What?
It's a weird,

2358
02:21:49.140 --> 02:21:52.460
nasty tasting thing that makes your heart feel funny.
Yeah.

2359
02:21:52.461 --> 02:21:54.470
They did it to me when I have my nose fixed.

2360
02:21:54.710 --> 02:21:58.850
I had a deviated septum that one of the,
if you folks,

2361
02:21:58.851 --> 02:22:00.470
if you please listen to me,

2362
02:22:00.830 --> 02:22:04.580
if you have it and you know guy who could fix it and he's a good doctor and he's

2363
02:22:04.581 --> 02:22:07.730
good at it,
please get it fixed.
It will change your fucking life.

2364
02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.910
Change your life.
I was a mouth breather most of my life.
I was like,

2365
02:22:12.140 --> 02:22:13.700
cause you'd been hit too many.

2366
02:22:13.760 --> 02:22:15.530
Well I fell down a flight of stairs when I was five,

2367
02:22:15.800 --> 02:22:18.500
before even before the hitting,
I broke my nose.
I was an idiot.

2368
02:22:18.501 --> 02:22:19.670
I was walking into trees and shit.

2369
02:22:20.350 --> 02:22:24.290
So then martial arts for a long time,

2370
02:22:24.291 --> 02:22:25.980
in the beginning I wasn't good,
so I

2371
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:29.800
<v 1>got hit a lot,
you know?
So I'm sure my nose took a beating people,</v>

2372
02:22:29.820 --> 02:22:32.970
the city of surgery,
dude,
I've been scared to get the surgery.

2373
02:22:33.180 --> 02:22:36.300
Every memory time I've had to get a surgery.
I've been like putting it off,

2374
02:22:36.301 --> 02:22:39.240
putting it off,
putting off,
putting off and just being in pain.

2375
02:22:39.540 --> 02:22:41.250
This has been my spine.
And,

2376
02:22:41.310 --> 02:22:46.000
and then I get the surgery and I wake up a fucking hour later and I'm like,
oh,

2377
02:22:46.290 --> 02:22:49.560
why didn't I get the surgery?
Like fucking surgeries.
Have you had done your back?

2378
02:22:49.590 --> 02:22:54.570
I did the Baja 1000 race in 2003.
That's that crazy race down in men's Mexico.

2379
02:22:54.571 --> 02:22:59.560
It's off road and I burst the l four l five disc.
Could you guys spot rash?
No,

2380
02:23:00.450 --> 02:23:01.530
just from compression.

2381
02:23:01.620 --> 02:23:05.490
Not Know Chris from jumping up and down your 30 hours.

2382
02:23:05.491 --> 02:23:06.780
There's ditches like this

2383
02:23:08.310 --> 02:23:12.200
800 over stuff.
They call them.
Whoops.

2384
02:23:16.380 --> 02:23:21.240
List race.
My friend bud,
Bud Brotzmann who is the executive producer of rides.

2385
02:23:21.241 --> 02:23:25.630
He does that shit every year.
That motherfucker every year.

2386
02:23:25.680 --> 02:23:27.960
I mean I didn't crash and I and I burst the disc in my spine.

2387
02:23:28.530 --> 02:23:32.350
Have those special Ford trucks the craziest for your honors.

2388
02:23:32.970 --> 02:23:33.920
Jesus floods.
Shit.

2389
02:23:33.940 --> 02:23:38.940
It's 35 inch travel on the shocks on my 35 inch travel.

2390
02:23:39.061 --> 02:23:43.000
Like that's almost three feet.
So when it's done,
okay,
you're,
you're,

2391
02:23:43.040 --> 02:23:47.050
you're disbursed.
What do they do?
The fuse it?
Uh,
no I have with the,

2392
02:23:47.070 --> 02:23:51.570
I had a Mike Rowe diskectomy so they fixed it without having to fuse it.

2393
02:23:52.110 --> 02:23:56.760
Then I did the same thing again.
Like same years later.
I didn't do Baja.

2394
02:23:56.761 --> 02:24:00.810
I drove cross country in a Camaro that did it.
What year?

2395
02:24:01.080 --> 02:24:05.970
2010 that's when the Camaro had such a bad seating position for me that sitting

2396
02:24:05.971 --> 02:24:09.150
in cars cause all right so I'm going to,
this is going to be tough.
You,

2397
02:24:09.160 --> 02:24:12.630
oh you're on camera cause you're tall.
So the roof was too short.

2398
02:24:13.050 --> 02:24:16.020
They have a weird roof too far.

2399
02:24:16.080 --> 02:24:19.710
I had to lean too far back and then reach forward.

2400
02:24:19.860 --> 02:24:24.720
Meaning my spine was like a c so every time I hit a bump that c would just

2401
02:24:24.721 --> 02:24:29.630
compress so at it again and I had to have it fixed again.
How so?

2402
02:24:29.640 --> 02:24:32.970
When they're fixing it,
they're just chucking a little piece of it off basically.

2403
02:24:32.971 --> 02:24:37.080
Yeah.
But after that you feel only get two,
you only get two.

2404
02:24:37.081 --> 02:24:40.350
I've had the to the next step is fusion and that's bad.

2405
02:24:40.830 --> 02:24:44.820
No more Baja for you while unfortunate care of yourself?
I try to,

2406
02:24:44.821 --> 02:24:48.660
but my job,
I stretch a lot.
I go to physical therapy,

2407
02:24:48.661 --> 02:24:50.010
I ride my bike when I'm home,

2408
02:24:50.011 --> 02:24:54.060
but unfortunately doing my job makes it worse.

2409
02:24:54.180 --> 02:24:57.810
Not doing my job makes it better.
Oh,
I see.
So driving the cars,

2410
02:24:57.811 --> 02:25:00.960
driving cars is what does it,
do you ask what your size your back?

2411
02:25:01.020 --> 02:25:04.380
I do when I'm home,
but I'm,
I'm a,
I'm home seven days.

2412
02:25:04.381 --> 02:25:09.381
The month of August I'm doing a 500 mile off road trip and the 2000 miles across

2413
02:25:10.261 --> 02:25:14.460
Europe in the same month with a bad spine man.
It's rough.
Yeah.
You know what man,

2414
02:25:14.970 --> 02:25:18.630
if you can make it a priority every place you stopped to go to a gym,

2415
02:25:18.660 --> 02:25:19.890
it would help me tremendously.

2416
02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:24.040
I'm sure it was strengthening your back will go a long to protecting

2417
02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:25.780
<v 0>you in that situation.
I think</v>

2418
02:25:25.880 --> 02:25:30.590
<v 2>last summer I had like a lull in work for a couple months and I didn't work very</v>

2419
02:25:30.591 --> 02:25:34.010
much and if the traveler much and I got,
I lost like 60 pounds.

2420
02:25:34.011 --> 02:25:37.610
I was just fucking great shape and then it just,
I started working again.

2421
02:25:37.611 --> 02:25:41.630
It's like the more money I make,
the worst physically I get.
And then I go,

2422
02:25:41.631 --> 02:25:46.550
you know,
if I'm broke,
I'm in great shape.
Moma fat.

2423
02:25:46.820 --> 02:25:51.410
You know,
it's,
it's,
and it sounds like I'm making excuses because I partially am,

2424
02:25:51.710 --> 02:25:55.130
because if I really,
I feel like if I really was committed that much,

2425
02:25:55.370 --> 02:25:59.110
I'd find a gym at the Holiday Inn,
you know?
But it's,

2426
02:25:59.330 --> 02:26:03.710
but as much as I love my job,
the days are long as fuck man.
You know,

2427
02:26:03.980 --> 02:26:07.580
my life sounds super glamorous when it's hacked down to 10 minutes a week,

2428
02:26:08.120 --> 02:26:11.400
you know,
the other,
how many days a week do you film car videos?

2429
02:26:12.350 --> 02:26:17.240
I'm filming one or two days a week,
but it's the other shit,
you know,

2430
02:26:17.510 --> 02:26:18.980
there's,
there's seven,

2431
02:26:18.981 --> 02:26:23.981
800 mile transits that we're driving rather than trying to save money and stays

2432
02:26:24.771 --> 02:26:27.020
in front of my computer fucking,
you know,

2433
02:26:27.050 --> 02:26:29.800
sourcing shit out and it's a fits fulltime.

2434
02:26:30.350 --> 02:26:35.150
<v 0>Do you hunt down all these various places that you go to yourself?</v>

2435
02:26:35.630 --> 02:26:38.690
Wow.
So it's just basically through your connections in the car world.

2436
02:26:38.780 --> 02:26:43.190
And I do our social media.
I do all our youtube management.
I do all that stuff.

2437
02:26:43.250 --> 02:26:46.940
How listen,
it must be a massive blessing to people like BBI.
Like you,

2438
02:26:46.941 --> 02:26:50.620
you blew them up,
man.
You know that video put look,

2439
02:26:50.630 --> 02:26:53.690
a lot of people like I'm sure called that place and said,

2440
02:26:53.691 --> 02:26:55.130
I want one of those fucking things.

2441
02:26:55.490 --> 02:27:00.490
We have estimated that appearing on our show for a shop is about $50,000 worth

2442
02:27:01.011 --> 02:27:01.844
of marketing value.

2443
02:27:01.880 --> 02:27:06.380
I think that's probably being the lowest and being conservative because those

2444
02:27:06.381 --> 02:27:09.410
videos are going to be around for a long ass time and you're dealing with,

2445
02:27:09.411 --> 02:27:12.320
as we were talking about really clock cars that are never going to go out of

2446
02:27:12.321 --> 02:27:15.620
style in 1980s Porsche or 1970s Porsche.

2447
02:27:15.620 --> 02:27:16.670
You're always going to want one of those,

2448
02:27:16.820 --> 02:27:20.720
so if you find some guy who builds the most wicked 1980s Porsche,

2449
02:27:20.930 --> 02:27:24.680
but you don't find out about it until 2024 and people were still driving cars,

2450
02:27:24.681 --> 02:27:27.770
you're still going to want to see that.
Yeah,
that stuff over the,

2451
02:27:27.771 --> 02:27:29.240
over the longterm,
I think will work.

2452
02:27:29.540 --> 02:27:33.650
That's going to be so weird when everybody else is fucking flying hovercrafts

2453
02:27:33.651 --> 02:27:37.070
and shit.
We're still like,
oh,

2454
02:27:37.100 --> 02:27:39.920
I hope they save us the cars,
man.
You know,
if the same me,

2455
02:27:39.921 --> 02:27:42.800
then that saved me the fucking premium octane,
I'll use it.

2456
02:27:43.340 --> 02:27:45.050
There will always be gas.

2457
02:27:45.110 --> 02:27:49.040
I'm all about limiting around in my volt to fucking use my corvette on the

2458
02:27:49.041 --> 02:27:52.130
weekends.
Why wouldn't makes you so confident that there will always be gasoline?

2459
02:27:52.160 --> 02:27:56.900
Because internal combustion engines are easy.
They're easy to fix,

2460
02:27:56.901 --> 02:27:58.460
they're easy to run,

2461
02:27:58.700 --> 02:28:02.720
and they're a relatively efficient in terms of,
you know,

2462
02:28:02.810 --> 02:28:06.610
the amount of power out.
The power density is a bunch of people they believe in,

2463
02:28:06.611 --> 02:28:09.920
in,
in the fact that the oil's running out,
right.
Peak oil,

2464
02:28:09.921 --> 02:28:14.060
it's called you don't subscribe to that is it really?
The science is not good.

2465
02:28:14.061 --> 02:28:17.900
They keep finding more oil and there there've been some studies done where on a

2466
02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:21.950
seabed oil just sort of appeared spontaneously.
There's

2467
02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:24.710
<v 2>new oil being made all the long term.</v>

2468
02:28:24.711 --> 02:28:29.150
I think they're probably right in the long,
long term,
but I really,

2469
02:28:29.180 --> 02:28:32.630
I think we're going to find something when it comes down to it,

2470
02:28:32.631 --> 02:28:35.660
when it really fucking comes down to it,
people get shit done.

2471
02:28:35.750 --> 02:28:38.210
We're going to be using it now before we run.

2472
02:28:38.211 --> 02:28:41.450
I haven't driven a hydrogen car before.
It drives like a fucking car.

2473
02:28:41.470 --> 02:28:44.900
Is that the Honda?
Did you drive a Honda,
the Honda or the BMW?

2474
02:28:45.810 --> 02:28:49.990
<v 0>Yeah,
they drive like cars,
oil,
oil coming off the seabed floor.</v>

2475
02:28:49.991 --> 02:28:53.770
That's a new thing that I just discovered recently to or heard of it heard
about.

2476
02:28:54.040 --> 02:28:57.620
I found some oil on the ground.
I was like,
wow,
this is weird.
And uh,

2477
02:28:57.640 --> 02:29:00.780
we googled it and it turns out like a lot of it is just natural.

2478
02:29:00.800 --> 02:29:04.600
Just comes out of the uh,
the bottom of the ocean out here near Malibu.

2479
02:29:04.601 --> 02:29:05.434
It was really,

2480
02:29:05.920 --> 02:29:10.920
I mean I guess they drill it loss go like they've got one at offshore oil

2481
02:29:11.051 --> 02:29:13.710
platforms and who knows what's happening there.

2482
02:29:13.711 --> 02:29:17.860
There might be a little leakage every now and again.
Oopsie sorry,

2483
02:29:17.920 --> 02:29:19.820
I didn't know like a pipeline that passed down,

2484
02:29:21.400 --> 02:29:26.400
it was really fucked up was when that a giant BP spill went down that it really

2485
02:29:27.401 --> 02:29:29.830
like the,
the amount of devastation.

2486
02:29:29.831 --> 02:29:33.880
It was fairly mild in comparison to the amount of fucking oil that went into the

2487
02:29:33.881 --> 02:29:36.160
ocean.
Like it was an insane amount of oil.

2488
02:29:36.161 --> 02:29:39.730
It just kept getting pumped into the ocean.
But the amount of devastation,

2489
02:29:39.731 --> 02:29:44.320
like I thought it was going to be like half the ocean was dead.
Everything died.

2490
02:29:44.500 --> 02:29:48.790
And they were,
they were talking about it almost like it's stopped.

2491
02:29:48.791 --> 02:29:51.610
Like a lot of the different animals like shrimps,

2492
02:29:51.611 --> 02:29:56.350
like fuck them up hard and attracts ruined.
Like a lot of the fishing's bad.

2493
02:29:56.430 --> 02:29:59.650
Yeah,
they fucked up a lot of things.
No doubt about it.

2494
02:29:59.651 --> 02:30:02.250
And it fucks up a lot of people that cleaned it out.
But if you looked at it,

2495
02:30:02.260 --> 02:30:05.350
you wouldn't even know.
You're like,
you're,
you would drive over it.

2496
02:30:05.370 --> 02:30:07.330
We in your bone,
you'd be like,
yeah,
it looks like water.

2497
02:30:08.170 --> 02:30:11.500
That's the fucking water darker today.
We're all,
the shit went down.

2498
02:30:11.890 --> 02:30:15.970
It's like the ocean can figure out probably how to get rid of the oil better.

2499
02:30:15.971 --> 02:30:19.780
They can figure out how to get real as shit.
We pump on it to disperse the oil,

2500
02:30:19.920 --> 02:30:22.380
<v 2>the,
oh the oceans in big trouble.</v>

2501
02:30:23.820 --> 02:30:28.320
The oceans are truly and seriously fucked and that's,
reefs are like gone.

2502
02:30:28.500 --> 02:30:32.100
Coral reefs are in trouble.
And the,
the,
you know,
they,
they,
they always,

2503
02:30:32.130 --> 02:30:36.180
everybody always talked about the Amazon where we're cutting down the Amazon and

2504
02:30:36.181 --> 02:30:39.600
it's the lungs of the earth creates all this oxygen.

2505
02:30:39.780 --> 02:30:44.780
The algae in the sea is more than double what the Amazon does and the ocean is

2506
02:30:46.411 --> 02:30:46.980
in trouble.

2507
02:30:46.980 --> 02:30:51.150
We really need to pay attention to that because it's at the core of the entire

2508
02:30:51.151 --> 02:30:54.150
global ecosystem and nobody's really paying much attention.

2509
02:30:54.360 --> 02:30:57.990
<v 0>Well,
and not only that,
like we're watching it grow,</v>

2510
02:31:00.150 --> 02:31:04.110
whether or not you believe global warming is caused by man,
whatever,
who knows?

2511
02:31:04.380 --> 02:31:06.270
I don't,
I'm not smart enough to understand that argument,

2512
02:31:06.271 --> 02:31:11.271
but when you watch the Greenland and watch these fucking giant Manhattan sized

2513
02:31:12.290 --> 02:31:15.570
chunks of ice falling into the ocean and you're like,
oh shit,

2514
02:31:15.571 --> 02:31:17.100
what is exactly going on here?

2515
02:31:17.240 --> 02:31:20.070
<v 2>That's going to be a problem.
And when the,
uh,
a lot</v>

2516
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:23.280
<v 1>of the ice melts,
it releases methane into the atmosphere,</v>

2517
02:31:23.281 --> 02:31:27.200
which accelerates the process of global warming.
It's almost,

2518
02:31:27.270 --> 02:31:32.090
it's almost like a double edge sword.
It's really kind of fascinating.
I mean the,

2519
02:31:32.091 --> 02:31:37.091
the whole idea of this ebb and flow in the temperature of certain regions and

2520
02:31:37.141 --> 02:31:40.530
the earth itself,
it seems to just be a natural cycle.
It seems too,

2521
02:31:40.830 --> 02:31:43.410
besides the fact that human beings are affecting it and accelerating,

2522
02:31:43.411 --> 02:31:45.030
it seems to have always been this way.

2523
02:31:45.300 --> 02:31:49.050
It's really strange when you look back at like the ice age and know that half of

2524
02:31:49.051 --> 02:31:53.820
North America was covering a mile high sheet of ice just 13 14,000 years ago or

2525
02:31:53.821 --> 02:31:57.360
whatever it was like that is not very long ago.
Man.
Blink of an eye.

2526
02:31:57.840 --> 02:32:01.500
What we've done.
You're right.
It's fluctuated natural ear over eons,

2527
02:32:01.501 --> 02:32:04.730
but we've compressed the time for sure.
No,

2528
02:32:04.770 --> 02:32:08.250
we're certainly conti beasts worthy of scorn.

2529
02:32:08.340 --> 02:32:13.280
I love you talking about Cunty dinosaurs,
the
asteroid,

2530
02:32:13.590 --> 02:32:17.670
China and India are really,
really thoroughly ruining it quickly.

2531
02:32:18.090 --> 02:32:20.280
What are they doing?
Well,
they've got,
you know,

2532
02:32:20.281 --> 02:32:22.290
all of our manufacturing capability,

2533
02:32:22.291 --> 02:32:25.710
but with none of our gives a fuck about the environment.

2534
02:32:25.711 --> 02:32:29.550
Richard Nixon past the environmental protection agency.

2535
02:32:29.620 --> 02:32:33.180
I mean the law that he was the promoter of the law that created the

2536
02:32:33.181 --> 02:32:35.850
environmental protection agency.
Richard Nixon of all people,

2537
02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:37.380
but they don't have that in India.

2538
02:32:37.390 --> 02:32:40.200
They don't have that in China and so they're just gone back.

2539
02:32:40.201 --> 02:32:43.980
Somebody get them a Richard Nixon,
they need hope.
They need one badly.

2540
02:32:43.981 --> 02:32:47.190
So India and China,
they have no rules or they have less rules.

2541
02:32:47.410 --> 02:32:51.660
It's pretty West over there and you see a lot of pictures,

2542
02:32:51.661 --> 02:32:52.720
you know they'll do,

2543
02:32:52.740 --> 02:32:57.630
I'll see my friends go on press launches over there and stuff and it's like La

2544
02:32:57.630 --> 02:33:00.510
Smaug is fucking amateur hour compared to Beijing.

2545
02:33:00.510 --> 02:33:04.700
Smaug well I saw this one's fucked place in China.
They did a special on,

2546
02:33:04.720 --> 02:33:06.030
I forget who did the documentary,

2547
02:33:06.031 --> 02:33:09.630
but they said it was like smoking three packs of cigarettes a day.
Just breathing

2548
02:33:11.920 --> 02:33:16.720
the skies like literally a dark brown,
like the surgical masks.
That's horrific.

2549
02:33:16.730 --> 02:33:20.490
Entered operating procedure over there.
Oh,
weird.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2550
02:33:20.550 --> 02:33:24.330
What happens is too many people in one spot,
what went wrong with that?
You know,

2551
02:33:24.331 --> 02:33:25.790
shitty diesel engines.

2552
02:33:25.830 --> 02:33:30.060
Fucking two people still running two stroke scooters are maximizing their

2553
02:33:30.061 --> 02:33:34.950
maximizing the short term economic gain by not spending a little more money on

2554
02:33:35.030 --> 02:33:38.430
pollution.
That trolls.
But when we look at,
Oh my God,
that is insane.

2555
02:33:38.431 --> 02:33:42.240
These people drive.
Imagine that's every day.
It's incredible.
It's amazing.

2556
02:33:42.241 --> 02:33:46.110
They're alive.
But what's,
what's really crazy is how many of them there are.

2557
02:33:46.710 --> 02:33:49.830
Oh yeah.
You know when you find out that China has a billion people,

2558
02:33:49.831 --> 02:33:51.930
India has a billion people.
You're like,
oh my God,

2559
02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.310
how do you manage that?
It seems like it gets that bay,

2560
02:33:56.311 --> 02:33:58.460
it gets like way out of control.
Impossible.

2561
02:33:58.470 --> 02:34:01.020
That's what we really have to deal with in America.
Right?

2562
02:34:01.021 --> 02:34:02.490
We have to make sure that doesn't happen.

2563
02:34:02.491 --> 02:34:04.830
And what the fuck happens when we had a billion,

2564
02:34:05.250 --> 02:34:08.790
we get third world style.
Oh Dude.

2565
02:34:09.480 --> 02:34:13.530
Population growth is lower in developed countries.
Yes.

2566
02:34:13.531 --> 02:34:16.350
And they're saying that as the rest of the world catches up,

2567
02:34:16.380 --> 02:34:17.980
that population growth will

2568
02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:21.250
<v 0>eventually be an issue in the negative way.
That's a theory.</v>

2569
02:34:21.700 --> 02:34:23.320
But those theories don't mean Jack Shit.

2570
02:34:23.920 --> 02:34:26.710
Cause these mother fuckers would never put the empty the future ever.

2571
02:34:26.830 --> 02:34:28.390
No one's ever predicted the future ever.

2572
02:34:28.391 --> 02:34:30.940
That's one thing you can count on with people.
The future.

2573
02:34:31.120 --> 02:34:33.030
Good fucking luck figuring that shit out.
Right.

2574
02:34:33.031 --> 02:34:35.500
Cause that seemed like common sense though a little bit.

2575
02:34:35.560 --> 02:34:38.230
We have enough people that it's going to be a problem at some point.

2576
02:34:38.231 --> 02:34:39.380
That seems like common sense.

2577
02:34:39.610 --> 02:34:42.610
That seems more like common sense than what these people were saying that

2578
02:34:42.640 --> 02:34:47.640
eventually with the places become more and more populated and more advanced as

2579
02:34:49.961 --> 02:34:53.260
far as technology that people will start having less kids that'd be more

2580
02:34:53.261 --> 02:34:56.140
educated and just handle itself melted.
It'll just,

2581
02:34:56.260 --> 02:34:58.390
the idea is that they'll start having,

2582
02:34:58.420 --> 02:35:02.290
they'll start having careers if they started having careers they'll back off the

2583
02:35:02.291 --> 02:35:05.110
amount of children cause it'd be more opportunity and that the reason why these

2584
02:35:05.111 --> 02:35:08.800
people in these impoverished areas have children is because they don't have any

2585
02:35:08.801 --> 02:35:12.730
financial opportunities that they have kids.
It's,
I'm not sure I buy it now.

2586
02:35:12.750 --> 02:35:15.820
They don't think of it makes rational sociological sense.

2587
02:35:15.821 --> 02:35:20.320
If you have nothing and you have no prospects of having anything,

2588
02:35:20.620 --> 02:35:24.160
your best chance of surviving and getting something is to have a bunch of kids

2589
02:35:24.161 --> 02:35:26.620
and maybe one of them will get something and take care of you.

2590
02:35:27.220 --> 02:35:30.460
That's a weird gamble.
I don't think anybody gambles like that.

2591
02:35:30.490 --> 02:35:32.450
I don't think anybody will banks on 30 years from now,

2592
02:35:32.451 --> 02:35:35.710
my kid's going to be the shit that's going to be able to sit back on a yacht

2593
02:35:35.711 --> 02:35:40.680
because my kid bought me some cool shit.
I that's serious.
It's not about God.

2594
02:35:40.690 --> 02:35:45.070
It's about Hologic justice and a roof over your head at that time.

2595
02:35:45.480 --> 02:35:47.440
The way these work food,

2596
02:35:47.441 --> 02:35:50.950
I'm going to have a baby and wait for that baby to get me some food as well.

2597
02:35:50.951 --> 02:35:54.280
I think telling these ancient tribal cultures,

2598
02:35:54.281 --> 02:35:57.610
they did want you to have children because your children could contribute to the

2599
02:35:57.611 --> 02:36:01.870
household and take care of you when your old,
exactly.
You're Jewish.

2600
02:36:02.020 --> 02:36:04.520
Jewish culture is make more fucking Jews.

2601
02:36:05.530 --> 02:36:09.670
The Jews are all about making more Jews and the Mormons.
Mormons too.

2602
02:36:09.730 --> 02:36:11.170
It's like how do you grow the religion?

2603
02:36:11.171 --> 02:36:14.580
You either have lots of wives and lots of kids or you just have the,

2604
02:36:14.650 --> 02:36:19.600
I got that as a group of people that don't take the religion too seriously.

2605
02:36:19.750 --> 02:36:23.620
Jewel Jews dominate.
Oh yeah.
It's done.
Reformed Jews,

2606
02:36:23.980 --> 02:36:27.430
levels of Jew.
They're exactly the sitter themselves.

2607
02:36:27.431 --> 02:36:32.431
Jews can be cool and rational and normal and somehow Jewish.

2608
02:36:32.591 --> 02:36:36.610
Thank you Joe.
Thanks true.
Whereas Catholics,
good fucking luck.

2609
02:36:36.820 --> 02:36:40.200
Every time I meet a grown man that tells me as a Catholic,
I'm like this dude.

2610
02:36:40.201 --> 02:36:44.020
It's crazy.
You're crazy.
What are you doing?
Crazy?

2611
02:36:44.130 --> 02:36:49.090
My friend was die hard Catholic and her dad was die hard Catholic until one day

2612
02:36:49.091 --> 02:36:54.091
he woke up gay and left the family and moved in with his boyfriend and now good

2613
02:36:55.511 --> 02:36:57.430
thing Catholicism worked well.

2614
02:36:57.430 --> 02:37:01.060
I think two people were silly and I think that you know,
there's the,

2615
02:37:01.090 --> 02:37:04.480
the beautiful thing about Catholic church entirely is the community,

2616
02:37:04.481 --> 02:37:05.410
the sense of community.

2617
02:37:05.440 --> 02:37:09.280
Nobody getting together and agreeing to not be a Douche bag for a day.
That's a,

2618
02:37:09.281 --> 02:37:13.510
that's a beautiful sentiment.
But everything else that it's wrapped up in,

2619
02:37:13.511 --> 02:37:18.050
it's a group of kid fuckers,
a crazy cult of kid fuckers.

2620
02:37:18.051 --> 02:37:22.490
He dressed like wizards.
It's complete total chaos.
Pope is coming around,

2621
02:37:22.530 --> 02:37:26.370
the new pump doesn't care.
People are gay.
Gay.

2622
02:37:26.780 --> 02:37:31.740
He was talking about gay priests.
He's like,
who am I to judge did for last Jews?

2623
02:37:31.910 --> 02:37:34.810
But did you know that if you follow the pope,
here's The d refute that.

2624
02:37:34.830 --> 02:37:36.860
Not to say that that wasn't a great quote by him,

2625
02:37:37.080 --> 02:37:38.450
but here's where it goes in the toilet.

2626
02:37:38.720 --> 02:37:42.530
He said that if you follow him on Twitter,
you get less time in purgatory.

2627
02:37:43.430 --> 02:37:48.260
I shit you not even if you're a Jew,
shit you not.
What if,
listen,
if you're a Jew,

2628
02:37:48.290 --> 02:37:50.780
you know that you live in a fake religion.
Okay?

2629
02:37:50.960 --> 02:37:54.770
You know that you guys have created this.
He came out of Catholicism.

2630
02:37:55.130 --> 02:37:56.810
They would have something,
some rationalization,

2631
02:37:56.840 --> 02:37:59.600
like you have to do it fake forth Judaism.

2632
02:37:59.601 --> 02:38:03.230
You have to join Christianity and admit Jesus Christ.

2633
02:38:03.231 --> 02:38:05.600
Take him into your soul and heart and then you'll be saved.

2634
02:38:05.690 --> 02:38:09.440
You know what's weird?
People?
Jews did that for a lot of years.

2635
02:38:09.441 --> 02:38:14.441
There's a whole weird group of Jewish ancestors in New Mexico who were Spanish

2636
02:38:15.470 --> 02:38:20.360
and they stopped being Jews became Catholics so they could escape to the new

2637
02:38:20.361 --> 02:38:25.250
world.
Wow.
Got to New Mexico and they practice their Judaism in secret.

2638
02:38:25.310 --> 02:38:29.710
That's,
no,
no.
This is the real secret.
This is,

2639
02:38:29.830 --> 02:38:33.380
this is like what's going back to like the 16th century,
you know?

2640
02:38:33.380 --> 02:38:35.930
I'm never one to tell anybody what is and isn't real,

2641
02:38:35.931 --> 02:38:40.020
because the whole thing is pretty sketchy.
Who knows?
But wall,

2642
02:38:40.030 --> 02:38:42.650
all I care about with religious peoples',
if that,

2643
02:38:42.651 --> 02:38:46.970
if they really do adhere to the principles,
the religious doctrines,

2644
02:38:46.971 --> 02:38:50.060
they're usually pretty nice people if they,
you know,
I mean it's not,

2645
02:38:50.120 --> 02:38:54.410
it's not 100%,
but the people that are trying to use it as like a tool box,

2646
02:38:54.411 --> 02:38:57.740
trying to use it as like a way to get your life be good people more.

2647
02:38:57.980 --> 02:39:00.680
I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
No,
no,
not at all.

2648
02:39:01.190 --> 02:39:05.690
I'm not anti religion for other people.
But you call yourself a Catholic.

2649
02:39:05.691 --> 02:39:10.150
You most likely a silly batch.
Me Now.
Not that anybody does.
I said if you,
you,

2650
02:39:11.120 --> 02:39:15.890
oh my God,
Todd,
sorry.
More Ex.
Just people then religious people.

2651
02:39:15.980 --> 02:39:20.750
Oh,
of course.
Yeah.
Well you know,
it's,
it,
it,
it's never that.
There's no god.

2652
02:39:20.780 --> 02:39:25.670
It's just that you look at any fucking story than anybody's ever told them about

2653
02:39:25.671 --> 02:39:29.330
anything.
And it's too hard to tell what the fuck really happened.
Right.

2654
02:39:29.331 --> 02:39:33.590
So hard to tell.
It's just a story.
It's so hard to tell,
like let's go back,

2655
02:39:33.591 --> 02:39:38.520
go back to the JFK assassination.
That shit was 1963 right.

2656
02:39:38.900 --> 02:39:42.620
Okay.
No one knows what happened.
We have a couple of videos.

2657
02:39:42.621 --> 02:39:44.810
There's a lot of different stories about what went down,

2658
02:39:44.811 --> 02:39:47.870
who was shooting at who and what they did to the body and the autopsy.

2659
02:39:48.020 --> 02:39:51.140
That was just,
that was within a human lifetime.
Right?

2660
02:39:51.470 --> 02:39:56.210
You want to go 500 years without even writing
my God.

2661
02:39:56.211 --> 02:39:59.870
Things get sketchy.
Yeah,
and you don't have,
you don't have photos.
Yeah,
no photos.

2662
02:40:00.290 --> 02:40:03.960
Did you guys even right back then?
Oh yeah.
We used to get out animal skins,

2663
02:40:03.990 --> 02:40:06.170
so we remember what we learned today.

2664
02:40:06.200 --> 02:40:11.200
We made a new factory and scrolls from the fucking buffalo tablets who told me

2665
02:40:12.291 --> 02:40:16.740
about fertility.
They were crazy asshole.
Oh,
by the way,

2666
02:40:16.741 --> 02:40:19.140
that guy was white like,
yeah.

2667
02:40:19.141 --> 02:40:23.100
They would occasionally stumble on magic mushrooms and eat a fucking pile of

2668
02:40:23.101 --> 02:40:26.910
them cause they were starving to death and completely rewired their religion.

2669
02:40:26.911 --> 02:40:30.510
All right,
we've got to try it.
Let's take it back to square zero.
Okay.

2670
02:40:30.511 --> 02:40:33.120
Everything we said was bullshit.
All right.
We're going to make it simple.

2671
02:40:33.121 --> 02:40:37.230
I got 10 ideas.
They parted the fucking sea on the Kod trip.

2672
02:40:38.140 --> 02:40:40.920
Fucking star David flags.
Well,
you know,

2673
02:40:40.921 --> 02:40:45.450
Jerusalem scholars actually are entertaining the idea like legitimate scars are

2674
02:40:45.451 --> 02:40:47.160
entertaining.
The idea that Moses,

2675
02:40:47.190 --> 02:40:50.370
when he saw the burning Bush was experiencing a psychedelic trip.

2676
02:40:50.760 --> 02:40:55.380
That makes sense.
That's the shopping sense religion,

2677
02:40:55.410 --> 02:40:59.730
religious statement ever made.
They even connected it to the Acacia Bush,

2678
02:40:59.731 --> 02:41:01.440
which is a very famous Bush,

2679
02:41:01.680 --> 02:41:05.700
a common Bush and that area that it is very rich and dimethyl trip to me really?

2680
02:41:05.730 --> 02:41:08.940
So this Bush could have potentially been dried out,

2681
02:41:09.150 --> 02:41:11.840
caught on fire huffing.

2682
02:41:11.841 --> 02:41:14.880
He's huffing to smoke and he experiences God.

2683
02:41:15.390 --> 02:41:18.090
It's very possible that that makes sense.
I mean,

2684
02:41:18.240 --> 02:41:22.080
why else would it be a burning Bush?
What's the Bush?
It's on fire and it's God,

2685
02:41:22.350 --> 02:41:27.150
Duh.
Okay.
I mean how much more they have to spell it out for you?

2686
02:41:27.170 --> 02:41:30.210
Most of these was a fucking drug and they only had 10 words back then.

2687
02:41:30.330 --> 02:41:32.940
They were doing their best.
That really does make sense.

2688
02:41:32.970 --> 02:41:36.760
It's totally logical explanation of religion and the history and what's logical.

2689
02:41:36.761 --> 02:41:40.950
That is not coming from people like me.
It's calming from a legitimate scholars,

2690
02:41:41.130 --> 02:41:44.400
which makes it fascinating is that they're considering the sources and the when

2691
02:41:44.410 --> 02:41:47.040
you know what the sources,
okay.
If you take you,

2692
02:41:47.080 --> 02:41:50.850
you trying to figure out what could have possibly caused this extraordinary

2693
02:41:50.851 --> 02:41:53.010
event that made them write this down,

2694
02:41:53.250 --> 02:41:55.950
while why would not you consider psychedelics?

2695
02:41:56.070 --> 02:41:59.430
Because it was really obvious that they worshiped a lot of different foods.

2696
02:41:59.560 --> 02:42:03.960
It was obvious they had like the ancient India,
they had mana and people had,
uh,

2697
02:42:03.961 --> 02:42:07.410
there was,
there was all sorts of different things.
So Ma,

2698
02:42:07.620 --> 02:42:10.650
which was supposed to be the greatest of all the psychedelics that the ancient

2699
02:42:10.651 --> 02:42:13.800
Hindus talked about.
Nobody even knows what the Fuck Soma is now.

2700
02:42:13.801 --> 02:42:17.010
It's just a shitty pill.
You buy it.
Yeah.
Well it's,
it's a sleeping pill.

2701
02:42:17.011 --> 02:42:18.090
Now this is interesting,

2702
02:42:18.091 --> 02:42:23.091
but the original Soma for was some sort of a competent Tory psychedelic brew

2703
02:42:23.850 --> 02:42:28.020
that might have involved more than one different type of psychedelic and it was

2704
02:42:28.021 --> 02:42:31.260
the shit to these people.
They worshiped it.
Why wouldn't they?

2705
02:42:31.280 --> 02:42:34.050
Of course they would.
Of course they have.
For the longest time,

2706
02:42:34.051 --> 02:42:37.180
people were afraid to say it.
For the longest time,
people were afraid to say,

2707
02:42:37.210 --> 02:42:40.980
right,
but now scours are accepting it as a reality.
They're like,
look,

2708
02:42:40.981 --> 02:42:43.050
we know the effects of these chemicals.

2709
02:42:43.380 --> 02:42:45.960
Let's stop pretending we don't know the effects of these chemicals.

2710
02:42:45.961 --> 02:42:48.960
And then what's consider,
were they in the area?
Oh yes they were.

2711
02:42:49.140 --> 02:42:52.230
And they were in bushes.
What happened to those bushes?
Catching on fire?
Well,

2712
02:42:52.231 --> 02:42:56.010
I guess it would release that chemical,
wouldn't it?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2713
02:42:56.011 --> 02:42:59.460
I mean it's not like extracting.
Haven't been there.
Never been to Israel.

2714
02:42:59.461 --> 02:43:04.290
Now it's,
there's too much shit blowing up over there.
Nah,
Israel is pretty safe.

2715
02:43:04.291 --> 02:43:07.560
If you say that.
It's an unbelievable,
you're all Jude out.

2716
02:43:09.160 --> 02:43:10.920
If you're a Jew,
they'll give you a trip.

2717
02:43:11.420 --> 02:43:14.940
I'm saying think about how many other religions are there though,
right?

2718
02:43:15.010 --> 02:43:19.170
The Muslim religion comes from there.
Yeah.
It's a weird place.
Oh,

2719
02:43:19.240 --> 02:43:23.020
well I'm sure he comes from there too,
buddy.
So was Elvis.

2720
02:43:24.420 --> 02:43:28.060
But it's,
it's absolutely fascinating that that part of the world,
um,

2721
02:43:28.180 --> 02:43:30.520
which still constantly a conflict,

2722
02:43:30.820 --> 02:43:33.040
like two dogs barking at each other across fences.

2723
02:43:33.040 --> 02:43:35.530
I mean it's like in a constant conflict in that area.

2724
02:43:35.590 --> 02:43:38.050
Israel's pretty soon they said they were going to resume piece stocks,

2725
02:43:38.090 --> 02:43:40.800
Israel or Palestine,
they should get their shit together.
John Kerry,

2726
02:43:40.890 --> 02:43:44.170
secretary of state is really on it.
That's beautiful.

2727
02:43:44.200 --> 02:43:46.480
Really serious about it and he's making some progress.

2728
02:43:46.540 --> 02:43:49.270
It would be sweet to happen.
That would be beautiful.
You know,

2729
02:43:49.271 --> 02:43:53.110
people need to realize at some point in time that you don't have a problem with

2730
02:43:53.111 --> 02:43:54.040
anybody over there.

2731
02:43:54.041 --> 02:43:56.680
This groups of people that believe they have problems with other groups of

2732
02:43:56.681 --> 02:44:00.520
people and most of it's bullshit.
Right.
Most of it is a lack of understanding,

2733
02:44:00.521 --> 02:44:01.480
communication,

2734
02:44:01.510 --> 02:44:04.450
being affiliated with a group that you don't really want to be affiliated with

2735
02:44:04.451 --> 02:44:07.630
getting lumped into this fucking group of people by birth.
Yeah,

2736
02:44:07.631 --> 02:44:10.630
it's curfew leave like two people by themselves in a room.

2737
02:44:10.670 --> 02:44:13.330
They'll probably get along when really most likely.
Yeah.

2738
02:44:13.360 --> 02:44:16.090
We use the podcast a analogy all the time.

2739
02:44:16.091 --> 02:44:19.570
Like we had this Guy Dan Carlin on the other day and it was me and Brian and

2740
02:44:19.571 --> 02:44:22.060
Jamie and Dan Carlin.
Like,
if we were on an island together,

2741
02:44:22.180 --> 02:44:26.500
we would have zero fights.
Right?
Like what will we argue about it?

2742
02:44:26.510 --> 02:44:29.560
We never have a war.
Everything it'd be,
we'd find out where the food is.

2743
02:44:29.561 --> 02:44:33.280
We'd split it up.
We figured out how to grow shit.
We would work it out,
you know?

2744
02:44:33.281 --> 02:44:36.220
But when you get too many God damn people like,
Hey,
you know,

2745
02:44:36.221 --> 02:44:37.990
it was just too many fucking egos.

2746
02:44:37.991 --> 02:44:40.540
It's too many ideas to other points of view are selfish.

2747
02:44:40.541 --> 02:44:44.050
When you get beyond like four people competition,

2748
02:44:44.290 --> 02:44:47.290
they can be or they cannot be.
It's possible to not be too,

2749
02:44:47.620 --> 02:44:51.010
but you got to really like act out.
That's gotta be an f.
Well,
no I don't.
I don't,

2750
02:44:51.011 --> 02:44:54.070
I don't,
I mean on an individual level they can do,
they cannot be,

2751
02:44:54.071 --> 02:44:57.640
but someone's going to be selfish if you have more than four people.
Well,

2752
02:44:57.650 --> 02:44:59.710
when you don't,
when you lose your accountability,

2753
02:44:59.740 --> 02:45:03.490
when you can like blend in the crowd of anonymous people and just driving around

2754
02:45:03.491 --> 02:45:06.070
in your car and just be a country Shithead,
you know?

2755
02:45:06.220 --> 02:45:10.540
It's like that's when things changes the equation.
Yeah.
When you moved to la?

2756
02:45:12.250 --> 02:45:15.670
Well,
I think,
um,
I think that it does change the equation though.

2757
02:45:15.671 --> 02:45:16.540
I think one of the things,

2758
02:45:16.541 --> 02:45:19.030
the reasons why people give each other the finger in cars is because they're

2759
02:45:19.031 --> 02:45:19.750
detached from me.

2760
02:45:19.750 --> 02:45:24.610
Trying to feel like whoever gives you the finger when you're walking,
no money.

2761
02:45:24.670 --> 02:45:27.970
There's no accountability.
Because if you look at,
let's consider a casino.

2762
02:45:27.971 --> 02:45:30.580
Have you ever gotten the finger given to you?
I'm going to casino.
No.
It's always,

2763
02:45:30.581 --> 02:45:33.580
excuse me.
Sorry.
He would just move in,
thrown and trying to get out of the way.

2764
02:45:33.581 --> 02:45:35.260
I've,
you know,
I mean,

2765
02:45:35.290 --> 02:45:39.040
you occasionally see a drunk and fight if you stay there late enough for the

2766
02:45:39.040 --> 02:45:41.710
month,
if you're lucky,
if you're lucky and you're in the right spot.

2767
02:45:41.760 --> 02:45:44.710
I love fucking Sharky's in Manhattan.
In Hermosa Beach,

2768
02:45:44.711 --> 02:45:45.670
that's where you're getting to fight.

2769
02:45:45.890 --> 02:45:50.770
But 99.9999% of the time when you're walking through a large group of people,

2770
02:45:50.771 --> 02:45:53.380
like in a mall,
right?
Something like that.
Everybody's cool with each other.
Yeah.

2771
02:45:53.500 --> 02:45:57.850
It's called.
We feel each other.
When you're a car,
you have,
fuck you.

2772
02:45:57.851 --> 02:46:01.110
It's like this weird thing.
You've got the capsule protection.
Yeah.

2773
02:46:01.300 --> 02:46:03.550
You gotta fucking box there.
You're good to go.

2774
02:46:03.610 --> 02:46:06.460
I've had people yell at me in the car before.

2775
02:46:06.461 --> 02:46:10.760
And which car did any of them really car?
Yeah,
over all the years.

2776
02:46:10.790 --> 02:46:13.880
I mean it's not often,
but when it does happen,
the rare time it does happen,

2777
02:46:13.881 --> 02:46:15.890
you're like,
whoa,
crazy charged up.

2778
02:46:15.891 --> 02:46:18.840
Mother Fucker is screaming at people in traffic.
No,

2779
02:46:18.890 --> 02:46:23.890
Michael Douglas on you one step up from a youtube comment or I had a guy take

2780
02:46:24.351 --> 02:46:25.370
off his shirt once,

2781
02:46:25.940 --> 02:46:29.780
took off his shirt to show me the sat twos in is start yelling at me.

2782
02:46:29.810 --> 02:46:33.200
He's the only man.
Okay.
First of all,
I know when I drive drive like a dick.

2783
02:46:33.750 --> 02:46:37.310
There have been times that I was guilty.
I am not a major deck,

2784
02:46:37.311 --> 02:46:42.080
but occasionally the person will make an aggressive maneuver that wasn't

2785
02:46:42.081 --> 02:46:46.580
recommended.
Okay.
That said,
I'm very friendly.
I wave.
I'm not,

2786
02:46:47.110 --> 02:46:51.410
I won't,
I won't do any douche moves.
Okay.
I'm not trying to be,
but this guy,

2787
02:46:51.411 --> 02:46:52.460
for whatever reason,

2788
02:46:52.580 --> 02:46:57.580
just decided that he wanted to get in front of me and that I didn't let him

2789
02:46:57.621 --> 02:47:01.340
quick enough.
Okay.
It was weird,
like the guy who went crazy,

2790
02:47:01.370 --> 02:47:04.490
like it was one of those like we're nothing really happened.
Right.
It was like,

2791
02:47:04.491 --> 02:47:07.640
you know,
I'm just trying to figure out how he's going to merge.
I'm looking back,

2792
02:47:07.641 --> 02:47:08.361
I'm looking to my left,

2793
02:47:08.361 --> 02:47:10.520
should I change lanes here and just let this guy in all the way.

2794
02:47:11.060 --> 02:47:15.330
And you know when I back off by the time he got beside me,
so fuck you,

2795
02:47:16.280 --> 02:47:19.940
fuck you and I,
and I'm like,
what happened?
And he goes,

2796
02:47:19.941 --> 02:47:23.220
you want to let me in you fucking piece of shit.
It was like,
oh my God.

2797
02:47:23.221 --> 02:47:26.150
And then he takes his shirt off and he shows me his tattoos and I was like,

2798
02:47:26.151 --> 02:47:29.420
this is the craziest thing.
There was a swastika on there.
So many,
oh no,

2799
02:47:29.421 --> 02:47:32.240
he had like a lot of tattoos and I just saw,
I just go,

2800
02:47:32.241 --> 02:47:35.130
you have really nice tattoos and I just bravo.

2801
02:47:35.540 --> 02:47:39.710
I gave him like zero aggression back.
I was like,
you're really nice tattoos and,

2802
02:47:39.711 --> 02:47:43.290
but he was like,
just like at highway speeds,
the traffic streets.

2803
02:47:43.410 --> 02:47:47.590
It's long time ago.
This is 1990 ish.
I'll never forget that Kat.
It says,

2804
02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:52.010
I'm like though that guy was just sad.
Bad for the guy might have stabbed me.

2805
02:47:52.040 --> 02:47:54.380
Like if I got out of the car,
that guy might have stabbed me.
I mean,

2806
02:47:54.381 --> 02:47:55.010
you never know.

2807
02:47:55.010 --> 02:47:57.730
That's the type of person that would fucking hit you with a crowbar.

2808
02:47:57.870 --> 02:47:59.980
You think you're fucking bad ass.
What is this?

2809
02:48:00.590 --> 02:48:02.660
Is this expendables and what is this?

2810
02:48:02.661 --> 02:48:04.550
Why are you showing this channel filling cool from Bollywood?

2811
02:48:04.551 --> 02:48:06.980
It's pretty sweet to go along with your story.

2812
02:48:07.010 --> 02:48:10.760
He just stepped out of a spinning kind of look like Stallone for a minute.

2813
02:48:11.120 --> 02:48:16.010
This is not,
go with my story.
Jamie,
stop this.
This is distracting.
Video mixing.

2814
02:48:16.240 --> 02:48:18.760
Rolling Mahindra SUV is,

2815
02:48:19.520 --> 02:48:23.810
is it bad that I can identify that?
No,
no.
That's an impressive company.

2816
02:48:24.650 --> 02:48:26.570
Why are you showing this man,
that's impressive.

2817
02:48:26.571 --> 02:48:29.990
I would have no idea what kind of car that was.
The Mahindra.

2818
02:48:30.600 --> 02:48:34.130
He knew it's a Bali.
You know how Bollywood cars are,
you know what they are?

2819
02:48:34.320 --> 02:48:38.750
I mean you can name that particular Indian vehicle.
How many different vehicles?

2820
02:48:38.751 --> 02:48:42.320
They have an Indian,
but they have like unique,
like a sports cars and Chili Fan.

2821
02:48:42.360 --> 02:48:43.600
Not Sports House.
No.

2822
02:48:43.660 --> 02:48:48.260
Now they import the sports cars in India they have like tuck talks and Todd Todd

2823
02:48:48.261 --> 02:48:51.770
nanos and Mahindra cars.
Like what's a Tuck Tuck?

2824
02:48:51.860 --> 02:48:55.490
It's like a three wheeled thing with a small motorcycle engine.

2825
02:48:56.400 --> 02:49:00.950
Power t u k talk,
talk,
Tuck,
tuck.
Two horsepower engine.

2826
02:49:00.960 --> 02:49:04.640
Like a guy in the WIC.
Tiny.

2827
02:49:05.630 --> 02:49:10.530
It's like a taxi and Mumbai and other places in and a family all are in a school

2828
02:49:10.531 --> 02:49:14.990
bus.
Right,
and a camel lead vehicle.
Everything.
Yeah.

2829
02:49:15.300 --> 02:49:18.370
Yeah.
Look at that and talk.
Talk.
No,
that's not a,
that's a,

2830
02:49:19.060 --> 02:49:23.040
that's a Rolls Royce of Tuck.
Tuck,
Tuck,
tuck.
Actually,

2831
02:49:23.070 --> 02:49:27.510
I'm not kidding you.
It's on chrome.
So it's essentially they realize,
hey look,

2832
02:49:27.511 --> 02:49:29.940
we don't really need a car.
Yeah,
it's warm out.

2833
02:49:30.690 --> 02:49:35.670
We just need something that's going to keep bill have fastest way to get shit

2834
02:49:35.671 --> 02:49:40.130
from one place to another.
That's all around asking people on a moped over there.

2835
02:49:40.530 --> 02:49:43.590
I mean they're crazy family of 19 and again,

2836
02:49:43.610 --> 02:49:45.000
is that because there's so many of them,

2837
02:49:45.001 --> 02:49:47.810
is that what happens when you get so many people and they stuffed him in this

2838
02:49:47.880 --> 02:49:49.020
one,
not enough space?

2839
02:49:49.340 --> 02:49:53.700
Is that just what we'd lose value and everyone's just to fucking wild animal.

2840
02:49:53.730 --> 02:49:57.900
Oh yeah.
It's just the way it is.
I mean that'll,
that'll grow and change.

2841
02:49:57.901 --> 02:50:01.710
India's growing and changing.
It's an amazing country.
Have you seen the,

2842
02:50:01.711 --> 02:50:06.110
I sound like such a liberal,
it sounded as you seen guilty.
I know.

2843
02:50:06.690 --> 02:50:11.690
Have you seen the videos of a Chinese people driving in like random videos from

2844
02:50:12.061 --> 02:50:15.990
Chinese streets where they just take turns into traffic?
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2845
02:50:16.560 --> 02:50:19.620
A friend tried to explain it to me,
this is non racist.

2846
02:50:19.621 --> 02:50:24.090
This is just a sociological and cultural.
He said Chinese people,

2847
02:50:24.630 --> 02:50:28.620
most most of them as they're walking down the street,
they're very polite.

2848
02:50:28.621 --> 02:50:32.610
They don't mind other people's business and they look straight ahead and they

2849
02:50:32.611 --> 02:50:34.260
don't look to the left hand,
don't look to the right.

2850
02:50:34.261 --> 02:50:35.220
And if they bump into each other,

2851
02:50:35.221 --> 02:50:39.370
they don't worry about it and they keep walking and it's normal.
So the,

2852
02:50:39.371 --> 02:50:43.230
the type of behavior required to drive an automobile is completely different.

2853
02:50:43.920 --> 02:50:48.060
You have to think completely different than your normal mode of transportation.

2854
02:50:48.060 --> 02:50:50.810
Your normal mode is your legs.
And when you do that,
you're,

2855
02:50:50.811 --> 02:50:53.100
you have a very specific way of looking at the world,

2856
02:50:53.350 --> 02:50:55.470
but you have to open wide when you drive a car.

2857
02:50:55.471 --> 02:50:57.150
And some of them just are not buying it.

2858
02:50:57.590 --> 02:51:02.000
So they just driving straight through intersections.
When he said this,
I,

2859
02:51:02.070 --> 02:51:04.590
I,
you know,
like,
cause he was talking about,

2860
02:51:05.090 --> 02:51:07.770
well he was talking about the reasons for stereotypes,
right?
He's like,

2861
02:51:07.771 --> 02:51:10.110
what are the reasons for certain stereotypes?
He goes,
well,
they're all,

2862
02:51:10.170 --> 02:51:13.080
almost all of them are based on something that makes sense.

2863
02:51:13.081 --> 02:51:14.490
Otherwise people wouldn't agree to them.

2864
02:51:14.880 --> 02:51:17.220
It may hurt people's feelings and they may be racist,

2865
02:51:17.430 --> 02:51:18.780
but let's try to find the root of it.

2866
02:51:18.781 --> 02:51:21.540
And so he was trying to find the root of Asian driving and he was like,

2867
02:51:21.541 --> 02:51:25.640
it's very clear.
It's like they're,
it's,
they're being humble and you know,

2868
02:51:25.650 --> 02:51:28.920
not drawing attention to themselves and not worrying about bumping into each

2869
02:51:28.921 --> 02:51:31.200
other at the other end of the spectrum.
Have you seen,

2870
02:51:31.201 --> 02:51:34.170
I mean like the crazy Arab drifting?
Yes.

2871
02:51:34.920 --> 02:51:39.920
Hog Wallah on two wheels changing a tire and I want to do a series here in the

2872
02:51:40.411 --> 02:51:43.640
states called Formula Hug Wallah where we actually had,

2873
02:51:43.641 --> 02:51:45.390
and they have to wear the gowns,

2874
02:51:45.391 --> 02:51:48.270
but they look like NASCAR it out with the sponsors and shit.

2875
02:51:48.300 --> 02:51:52.380
That's harder energy.
Fucking hug Wallah,
you know.

2876
02:51:52.381 --> 02:51:54.290
And they have no guard rails.
You know,

2877
02:51:54.300 --> 02:51:57.930
you have oncoming traffic of course somebody,
some poor bastard.

2878
02:51:57.931 --> 02:52:00.330
That's the sign up for that shit.
They got to wear a turban though.

2879
02:52:00.530 --> 02:52:05.530
And Marlboro just hog Walla into traffic to the of thousands.

2880
02:52:06.010 --> 02:52:10.030
<v 1>If you even put that Marlboro turban down on paper and they'll fuck,</v>

2881
02:52:10.660 --> 02:52:15.070
here we go.
Look at these fucking guys here guys.
So we'll,

2882
02:52:15.400 --> 02:52:19.060
that's a dye hotsy rocky at 90 miles an hour,
right?

2883
02:52:19.780 --> 02:52:21.580
Something,
I mean,
I don't know.

2884
02:52:21.590 --> 02:52:26.590
Can't be 90 35 or 40 it's scary enough to scare the fuck out of you because if

2885
02:52:27.521 --> 02:52:30.310
that guy comes down,
that wheel is in back on,
he's fucked.

2886
02:52:31.380 --> 02:52:33.010
I keep that driving.

2887
02:52:33.970 --> 02:52:37.720
Essentially it's half an hour changing a fucking wheel.

2888
02:52:37.780 --> 02:52:41.860
The road goes straight
all the way across the desert.

2889
02:52:42.130 --> 02:52:46.240
This guy's changing a fuck and have you seen the road?
The road skating?

2890
02:52:46.300 --> 02:52:49.690
Oh my God.
Look at this.
He took the wheel off and they're staring at it.
Yeah,

2891
02:52:49.691 --> 02:52:50.470
he's got,
they're getting,

2892
02:52:50.470 --> 02:52:55.210
are they going to try to put that wheel back on other switching?
Yes.
Okay.

2893
02:52:55.211 --> 02:52:58.870
How could you possibly put a wheel on why the car is going that fast and that's

2894
02:52:58.871 --> 02:53:02.290
the driver is only two wheels on the road.
Yeah,
but it doesn't matter.

2895
02:53:02.291 --> 02:53:06.330
Your actual spinning.
How are you going to connect it to the accidents there?

2896
02:53:06.340 --> 02:53:09.040
Free wheeling the eye.
It's not a live axle.
Yeah,

2897
02:53:09.510 --> 02:53:14.440
they're independent suspension so that the axle without the wheel isn't

2898
02:53:14.441 --> 02:53:16.440
spinning,
but he has a back wheels off too.

2899
02:53:16.740 --> 02:53:21.400
It has open differentials open with us with an open differentially by God.

2900
02:53:21.401 --> 02:53:23.980
That is insane.
The vehicle is,

2901
02:53:23.981 --> 02:53:28.510
would be lightly prepped for this test very lightly,
right?
I mean,

2902
02:53:28.511 --> 02:53:30.910
they opened differential.
Oh my God.

2903
02:53:30.911 --> 02:53:34.180
Look at this guy hanging out the bottom of this.
This guy is insane.

2904
02:53:34.900 --> 02:53:38.410
The Guy Inside is handling some serious fucking pressure.

2905
02:53:39.250 --> 02:53:42.100
Matt did this with a Hertz rental car.
People die doing this shit.

2906
02:53:44.460 --> 02:53:48.700
No joke.
People actually really die doing this to stop all the time.
Oh no joke.

2907
02:53:48.701 --> 02:53:50.640
Come on.
Of course they died.

2908
02:53:54.250 --> 02:53:57.340
He's driving while he's hanging out the window and he's on two.
We see that.

2909
02:53:57.341 --> 02:54:01.780
You see the road skating.
Look up Saudi road skating.
They,
they skate.

2910
02:54:01.810 --> 02:54:05.590
It's unbelievable ways in sandals.
Those people are crazy.
Yes.

2911
02:54:05.591 --> 02:54:07.570
What they have nothing else to do with their time.

2912
02:54:07.930 --> 02:54:10.720
Is that what it is or they just gangster?
No,

2913
02:54:10.721 --> 02:54:13.480
they have all the money in the world and all the oil in the world.

2914
02:54:13.600 --> 02:54:17.710
What else are you going to do and all the sandals in the world here.
Look here.

2915
02:54:17.711 --> 02:54:21.070
Look at these guys.
Skating in sandals on the highway.

2916
02:54:21.100 --> 02:54:24.870
That is inside of a,
what looks like a Hyundai Elantra.

2917
02:54:24.930 --> 02:54:29.220
They climb out and climb back in.
Oh my God.
That is insane.
Look at them.

2918
02:54:29.221 --> 02:54:34.150
Hang backwards.
Oh my God.
Like in traffic.

2919
02:54:34.180 --> 02:54:39.010
Oh my God.
He's hanging backwards break.
He's just stepping out there.

2920
02:54:39.460 --> 02:54:43.610
This is so insane.
I have never seen anything this.

2921
02:54:43.611 --> 02:54:45.910
And so my God chose mine.
Sloan.
Right.

2922
02:54:46.140 --> 02:54:50.850
Silly counties are those just street scandal.
Looking at the,

2923
02:54:50.851 --> 02:54:53.440
look at him hanging out the door right there.
I like that.

2924
02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.500
These guys are standing on the tarmac.
It's one,

2925
02:54:57.501 --> 02:55:01.390
one foot up in the air as the move.
This is so crazy.
Oh my God.

2926
02:55:01.391 --> 02:55:02.320
I'm shitting my pants.

2927
02:55:04.120 --> 02:55:08.300
<v 0>Oh,
it's great fun.
I feel like we're encouraging something awful by playing this.</v>

2928
02:55:08.360 --> 02:55:12.470
Don't do this at home kids.
Please don't do that at home.
It's already been done.

2929
02:55:12.471 --> 02:55:15.380
It's on youtube.
Go enjoy it.
You'll die doing that.

2930
02:55:15.381 --> 02:55:19.150
Probably way too dangerous podcast is over.
Yeah.

2931
02:55:19.200 --> 02:55:23.300
That's basically three hours we did it.
Um,

2932
02:55:23.330 --> 02:55:27.980

2945
02:56:09.530 --> 02:56:13.970
I liked that one.
