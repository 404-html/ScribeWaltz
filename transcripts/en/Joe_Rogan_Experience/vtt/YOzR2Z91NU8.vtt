<v Speaker 1>He fucking hates glory.</v>

19
00:00:25.381 --> 00:00:27.000
<v Speaker 1>They talk shit about him after he left,</v>

20
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.663
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

21

32
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.660
<v Speaker 1>That's should be interesting.</v>

33
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.101
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

34
00:00:41.101 --> 00:00:43.110
<v Speaker 1>all this is live from Denver,</v>

35
00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Colorado right now on UFC fight pass.</v>

36
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.540
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have UFC fight pass,</v>

37
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.660
<v Speaker 1>shame on you because a,</v>

38
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.590
<v Speaker 1>it's a great way to waste days,</v>

39
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.030
<v Speaker 1>days of time,</v>

40
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.630
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

41
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.530
<v Speaker 1>You need to sit down and watch whatever you want from anywhere in the world.</v>

42
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.000
<v Speaker 1>It's Netflix for fights.</v>

43
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.230
<v Speaker 1>This is what it is.</v>

44
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.260
<v Speaker 1>It's just like they have everything from way back in the pride days.</v>

45
00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:05.490
<v Speaker 1>All the old fade or fights,</v>

46
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.880
<v Speaker 1>the Vandelay fights back in the early two thousands,</v>

47
00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:09.714
<v Speaker 1>all that shit.</v>

48
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.540
<v Speaker 1>And it's fun to go back and watch some of those little ones too.</v>

49
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:13.890
<v Speaker 1>Especially the pride tournament's.</v>

50
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

51
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:15.080
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

52
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.170
<v Speaker 1>The golden days.</v>

53
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.440
<v Speaker 1>So the first fight of the night here is Justin Holton versus Jonathan Wide</v>

54
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Darko.</v>

55
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.823
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

56
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.843
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

57
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.410
<v Speaker 1>they're reading the glory rules.</v>

58
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

59
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.660
<v Speaker 1>did you do much kickboxing at all?</v>

60
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.570
<v Speaker 1>I had full amateur kickboxing fights,</v>

61
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

62
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.380
<v Speaker 1>three and mature boxing matches and to pro.</v>

63
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.390
<v Speaker 1>So was it American rules or Muay Thai [inaudible] Muay Thai to American rules.</v>

64
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.170
<v Speaker 1>So it was,</v>

65
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.003
<v Speaker 1>it was fun.</v>

66
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.371
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

67
00:01:41.371 --> 00:01:42.270
<v Speaker 1>it was amateur,</v>

68
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.890
<v Speaker 1>so we were wearing headgear,</v>

69
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.970
<v Speaker 1>we didn't throw elbows,</v>

70
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.560
<v Speaker 1>but it was good.</v>

71
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.490
<v Speaker 1>I was undefeated,</v>

72
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.200
<v Speaker 1>so that's good then.</v>

73
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.123
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>

74
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

75
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.950
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting because,</v>

76
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

77
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.730
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

78
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge fan of kickboxing and I'm just kind of surprised that kickboxing</v>

79
00:01:59.191 --> 00:02:03.180
<v Speaker 1>hasn't taken off in America the way MMA has,</v>

80
00:02:03.181 --> 00:02:05.790
<v Speaker 1>but I just don't think it's been promoted the right way.</v>

81
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.500
<v Speaker 1>And Or,</v>

82
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.351
<v Speaker 1>and there was a,</v>

83
00:02:08.351 --> 00:02:12.330
<v Speaker 1>a Dana white had a real good point and he said that the reason why is because</v>

84
00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:13.164
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

85
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.320
<v Speaker 1>when you think of kickbox and they think of PKA karate from ESPN at two o'clock</v>

86
00:02:18.331 --> 00:02:20.040
<v Speaker 1>in the morning from the 1980s,</v>

87
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

88
00:02:20.401 --> 00:02:23.700
<v Speaker 1>you have to throw this five kicks the book and it was like Shitty,</v>

89
00:02:23.701 --> 00:02:25.830
<v Speaker 1>sloppy boxing and they,</v>

90
00:02:25.831 --> 00:02:26.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

91
00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:27.060
<v Speaker 1>they would throw those,</v>

92
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.810
<v Speaker 1>they would barely throw those kicks and then the pants they were wearing like</v>

93
00:02:30.811 --> 00:02:32.040
<v Speaker 1>all of that was just crap.</v>

94
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.613
<v Speaker 1>Silly man.</v>

95
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.940
<v Speaker 1>They are fighting in pajamas with the boots,</v>

96
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.430
<v Speaker 1>those big boots that they would wear on the back on their feet.</v>

97
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.500
<v Speaker 1>What it is kinda interesting the boots,</v>

98
00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:43.440
<v Speaker 1>because I brought this up many times when it comes to um,</v>

99
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.611
<v Speaker 1>MMA.</v>

100
00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:47.300
<v Speaker 1>Like why do your elbows have nothing on him?</v>

101
00:02:47.301 --> 00:02:50.730
<v Speaker 1>Why do your shins and knees have nothing on him but your knuckles do,</v>

102
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.940
<v Speaker 1>which is like the easiest thing to break.</v>

103
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.490
<v Speaker 1>The hardest thing to hit somebody hard with is a fist.</v>

104
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

105
00:02:57.391 --> 00:02:58.980
<v Speaker 1>But you use those more.</v>

106
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 1>And then then because of the cuts,</v>

107
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 1>I think mostly for cuts,</v>

108
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:05.530
<v Speaker 1>bone on bone and that skin getting pinched in between there.</v>

109
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.000
<v Speaker 1>For sure he's getting cut up.</v>

110
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.781
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

111
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 1>But isn't that the case with elbows?</v>

112
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:10.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

113
00:03:10.271 --> 00:03:12.910
<v Speaker 1>but I mean it's harder to land an elbow ignites.</v>

114
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 1>Your name is Tim means it's harder to land an elbow.</v>

115
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:16.541
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

116
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:17.440
<v Speaker 1>The land punches.</v>

117
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.700
<v Speaker 1>There's a few guys that are real elbow specialist.</v>

118
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:22.623
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

119
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.090
<v Speaker 1>Jordan means another one.</v>

120
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.070
<v Speaker 1>I remember when he fought Cyborg,</v>

121
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.860
<v Speaker 1>the other side board,</v>

122
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.070
<v Speaker 1>not the female to male Cyborg and strike force.</v>

123
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.791
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

124
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:32.620
<v Speaker 1>That elbow combination,</v>

125
00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:33.340
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

126
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.530
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing I don't like about glory.</v>

127
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.530
<v Speaker 1>I really wish they would go a full Moy Tai and um,</v>

128
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.750
<v Speaker 1>when Joe Schilling gets here,</v>

129
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

130
00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:41.980
<v Speaker 1>Joe's obviously,</v>

131
00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:42.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

132
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.770
<v Speaker 1>he's done both and he started out in [inaudible].</v>

133
00:03:44.771 --> 00:03:49.771
<v Speaker 1>He's a big Muay Thai fan and they're having a lion fight is on tonight at the</v>

134
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:50.681
<v Speaker 1>same time.</v>

135
00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:53.050
<v Speaker 1>So that's on access TV right now.</v>

136
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.840
<v Speaker 1>While this is going on right now on um,</v>

137
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.120
<v Speaker 1>on UFC fight pass.</v>

138
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.850
<v Speaker 1>I have never been,</v>

139
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.541
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

140
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:02.740
<v Speaker 1>outside of an MMA fight,</v>

141
00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:03.880
<v Speaker 1>I've never been hit with a,</v>

142
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.530
<v Speaker 1>with an elbow and Emily Tye fight.</v>

143
00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:09.010
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that would throw me off like it did for some reason.</v>

144
00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:10.450
<v Speaker 1>I feel it's different than MMA.</v>

145
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.320
<v Speaker 1>Like in MMA,</v>

146
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.363
<v Speaker 1>I've never been hit.</v>

147
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember being hit with an elbow on my feet,</v>

148
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:15.910
<v Speaker 1>but on the mat,</v>

149
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:16.690
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

150
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.523
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

151
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.360
<v Speaker 1>but in kickboxing,</v>

152
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's where you're at and I don't know that it's kind of scary.</v>

153
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.420
<v Speaker 1>I've hit people with elbows on my feet and it seems you'd,</v>

154
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.340
<v Speaker 1>it would,</v>

155
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.060
<v Speaker 1>it'd be shitty to be on the receiving end,</v>

156
00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:28.894
<v Speaker 1>the one that knows,</v>

157
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:31.570
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

158
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.400
<v Speaker 1>But it's very effective and I always feel like anytime you're eliminating</v>

159
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:38.110
<v Speaker 1>effective aspects of striking,</v>

160
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.211
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you take moy,</v>

161
00:04:39.211 --> 00:04:42.220
<v Speaker 1>Tai and you eliminate two effective aspects of it.</v>

162
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.660
<v Speaker 1>Elbows and the clinch.</v>

163
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

164
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.161
<v Speaker 1>those are,</v>

165
00:04:45.161 --> 00:04:47.800
<v Speaker 1>those are two huge factors in fights,</v>

166
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.030
<v Speaker 1>especially the clinch.</v>

167
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.571
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

168
00:04:49.571 --> 00:04:52.240
<v Speaker 1>you take a guy like San Chai who can dump people from anywhere.</v>

169
00:04:52.241 --> 00:04:53.350
<v Speaker 1>He just flips dudes,</v>

170
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

171
00:04:53.951 --> 00:04:58.600
<v Speaker 1>he's so good at the clinch and so good at throwing elbows and knees to the body</v>

172
00:04:58.601 --> 00:04:59.434
<v Speaker 1>from the clinch.</v>

173
00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.831
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

174
00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:00.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

175
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.941
<v Speaker 1>I would look more,</v>

176
00:05:00.941 --> 00:05:04.780
<v Speaker 1>the only thing I really don't like about Gloria is they feel like they do break</v>

177
00:05:04.781 --> 00:05:06.280
<v Speaker 1>you from the clinch real quick.</v>

178
00:05:06.281 --> 00:05:07.480
<v Speaker 1>We don't even have time to,</v>

179
00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:07.711
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

180
00:05:07.711 --> 00:05:08.890
<v Speaker 1>to work in it needs in there.</v>

181
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:09.783
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

182
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.790
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like you should be able a to defend yourself if you get hurt and be,</v>

183
00:05:15.401 --> 00:05:19.150
<v Speaker 1>you should be able to work needs to the body and elbows in the clench.</v>

184
00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:19.391
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

185
00:05:19.391 --> 00:05:22.310
<v Speaker 1>it's just a massive part of Muay Thai and uh,</v>

186
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.870
<v Speaker 1>they've,</v>

187
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.660
<v Speaker 1>they've just sort of eliminated it to make it more exciting.</v>

188
00:05:25.661 --> 00:05:30.661
<v Speaker 1>And it all came from k one k one was like a big step up from PKA.</v>

189
00:05:31.361 --> 00:05:31.811
<v Speaker 1>Karate.</v>

190
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:33.610
<v Speaker 1>It was a big step up from kickboxing,</v>

191
00:05:33.611 --> 00:05:38.611
<v Speaker 1>but they develop some rules that they thought would favor action and make things</v>

192
00:05:39.731 --> 00:05:40.564
<v Speaker 1>go quicker.</v>

193
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

194
00:05:41.561 --> 00:05:42.360
<v Speaker 1>I remember the first,</v>

195
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

196
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.170
<v Speaker 1>k one that was,</v>

197
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.130
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like,</v>

198
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.371
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

199
00:05:45.371 --> 00:05:47.950
<v Speaker 1>92 93 maybe [inaudible] 94 here.</v>

200
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

201
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.920
<v Speaker 1>where they advertised it as 80% knockouts.</v>

202
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:52.030
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember that?</v>

203
00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:53.290
<v Speaker 1>80% knock guys,</v>

204
00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:54.760
<v Speaker 1>they had five fights in the car at four.</v>

205
00:05:54.761 --> 00:05:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Four ended by knockout.</v>

206
00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.250
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>

207
00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:58.880
<v Speaker 1>80% knockouts.</v>

208
00:05:58.881 --> 00:06:00.200
<v Speaker 1>It's so fucking crazy.</v>

209
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:01.700
<v Speaker 1>But I wouldn't be surprised.</v>

210
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.481
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

211
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:02.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

212
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.160
<v Speaker 1>I know chemo fund on that.</v>

213
00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

214
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:05.211
<v Speaker 1>oh wow.</v>

215
00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:06.100
<v Speaker 1>That's Rasa.</v>

216
00:06:06.101 --> 00:06:08.300
<v Speaker 1>Setaki wow.</v>

217
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.930
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

218
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh that is so old school.</v>

219
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.500
<v Speaker 1>Think Good Ridge may fall on that too.</v>

220
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember for sure.</v>

221
00:06:13.611 --> 00:06:18.410
<v Speaker 1>But it's just striking becomes a completely different animal when there's no</v>

222
00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:19.360
<v Speaker 1>threat of the takedown.</v>

223
00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.213
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

224
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.960
<v Speaker 1>it just does.</v>

225
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.390
<v Speaker 1>And it also becomes a completely different animal when there's no,</v>

226
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.190
<v Speaker 1>the Moitai aspect is removed.</v>

227
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.310
<v Speaker 1>The no threat of the clinch and no threat of the elbows.</v>

228
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

229
00:06:28.791 --> 00:06:30.180
<v Speaker 1>that changes the range a lot.</v>

230
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:31.970
<v Speaker 1>You see guy easy,</v>

231
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.150
<v Speaker 1>what does the name hot and just did a spin.</v>

232
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.310
<v Speaker 1>You don't see a whole lot of spinning in MMA.</v>

233
00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:38.850
<v Speaker 1>You get guys like wonder boy,</v>

234
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.030
<v Speaker 1>those guys that can do it and they do it well,</v>

235
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.860
<v Speaker 1>but you don't see that as much in a,</v>

236
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:44.090
<v Speaker 1>if you watch the UFC card,</v>

237
00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:46.730
<v Speaker 1>you want to see as many spins as you do it and in glory.</v>

238
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.181
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

239
00:06:47.181 --> 00:06:50.220
<v Speaker 1>I think really the only way to get them all,</v>

240
00:06:50.221 --> 00:06:50.991
<v Speaker 1>not the only way,</v>

241
00:06:50.991 --> 00:06:52.150
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

242
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:57.220
<v Speaker 1>it's so hard for guys who develop an overall MMA game to ever be like really</v>

243
00:06:58.371 --> 00:07:00.860
<v Speaker 1>effective with those kinds of traditional martial arts techniques.</v>

244
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.290
<v Speaker 1>Because I feel like some of those taekwondo techniques and kill Christian</v>

245
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.143
<v Speaker 1>techniques,</v>

246
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.800
<v Speaker 1>you have to start out with that stuff and not worry about getting punched in the</v>

247
00:07:09.801 --> 00:07:11.330
<v Speaker 1>face in order to develop them.</v>

248
00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:11.731
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

249
00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:15.260
<v Speaker 1>that's a big aspect of kill Kachin and a big aspect of taekwondo is that people</v>

250
00:07:15.261 --> 00:07:16.280
<v Speaker 1>aren't punching you in the face.</v>

251
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:16.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

252
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:17.420
<v Speaker 1>Not Getting it.</v>

253
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:17.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

254
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.411
<v Speaker 1>because you're not,</v>

255
00:07:18.411 --> 00:07:19.340
<v Speaker 1>you don't have that threat.</v>

256
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

257
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:25.190
<v Speaker 1>So you develop those crazy kicks and the leg dexterity and then I feel like</v>

258
00:07:25.191 --> 00:07:27.020
<v Speaker 1>that's a great stepping stone.</v>

259
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.470
<v Speaker 1>If you can go from that and then learn how to wrestle and learn Jujitsu and</v>

260
00:07:30.471 --> 00:07:32.000
<v Speaker 1>learn how to box and kickboxing,</v>

261
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.190
<v Speaker 1>then you'll always have those techniques.</v>

262
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:34.760
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

263
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.760
<v Speaker 1>it's so rare that you take a guy who is like a real from the beginning,</v>

264
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.400
<v Speaker 1>mixed martial arts fighter and then develop that kind of ability.</v>

265
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:44.331
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

266
00:07:44.331 --> 00:07:45.081
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>

267
00:07:45.081 --> 00:07:45.281
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

268
00:07:45.281 --> 00:07:47.820
<v Speaker 1>they're focused on every aspect of martial law.</v>

269
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.130
<v Speaker 1>She was almost too much to learn.</v>

270
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:49.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

271
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.590
<v Speaker 1>You have to be a Highlander to get it all down.</v>

272
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

273
00:07:53.391 --> 00:07:54.224
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

274
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.621
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

275
00:07:54.621 --> 00:07:58.820
<v Speaker 1>it's so rare that anybody has like a full game that starts out from the</v>

276
00:07:58.821 --> 00:07:59.330
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>

277
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.910
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

278
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.800
<v Speaker 1>I think we're seeing these guys today,</v>

279
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:04.460
<v Speaker 1>which is Kinda,</v>

280
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:05.600
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting time.</v>

281
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:09.050
<v Speaker 1>There's the real specialists like Wonderboy and on the other end,</v>

282
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.070
<v Speaker 1>like Damien Maia,</v>

283
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:10.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

284
00:08:10.761 --> 00:08:12.560
<v Speaker 1>seeing real specialists,</v>

285
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.720
<v Speaker 1>you don't see that as much anymore.</v>

286
00:08:14.721 --> 00:08:14.991
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

287
00:08:14.991 --> 00:08:17.090
<v Speaker 1>guys were individual specialists back in the day,</v>

288
00:08:17.091 --> 00:08:17.661
<v Speaker 1>but now you get,</v>

289
00:08:17.661 --> 00:08:17.950
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

290
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:18.900
<v Speaker 1>you get a guy like wanting to,</v>

291
00:08:18.901 --> 00:08:19.070
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

292
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.270
<v Speaker 1>you get a guy like Stephen Thompson,</v>

293
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:20.571
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

294
00:08:20.571 --> 00:08:21.470
<v Speaker 1>me and Tyron Woodley,</v>

295
00:08:21.471 --> 00:08:22.190
<v Speaker 1>great wrestler.</v>

296
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.990
<v Speaker 1>He started mixing the rest into his game.</v>

297
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:29.360
<v Speaker 1>Then you get these guys like Dustin pull a Messiah backtick that came up doing</v>

298
00:08:29.361 --> 00:08:32.930
<v Speaker 1>MMA and they're really good at different aspects of it.</v>

299
00:08:32.931 --> 00:08:36.410
<v Speaker 1>Real strong and say the wrestling and Jujitsu,</v>

300
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:37.700
<v Speaker 1>good kickboxing,</v>

301
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:38.850
<v Speaker 1>but you put them in,</v>

302
00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:39.071
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

303
00:08:39.071 --> 00:08:39.831
<v Speaker 1>in a ring with,</v>

304
00:08:39.831 --> 00:08:40.041
<v Speaker 1>with uh,</v>

305
00:08:40.041 --> 00:08:40.874
<v Speaker 1>Joe Schilling,</v>

306
00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.440
<v Speaker 1>Schilling Ladies Gentlemen,</v>

307
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:44.150
<v Speaker 1>as if on cue</v>

308
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.130
<v Speaker 1>Joe showing where there's a draw them on.</v>

309
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:55.010
<v Speaker 1>We were just talking about the difference between a real specialists,</v>

310
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 1>a high level specialty,</v>

311
00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:01.140
<v Speaker 1>like a Stephen Thompson in MMA versus a guy like a Dustin Poirier who's a very</v>

312
00:09:02.101 --> 00:09:02.934
<v Speaker 1>good striker.</v>

313
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.280
<v Speaker 1>But Wonderboy is something special,</v>

314
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:05.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

315
00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.080
<v Speaker 1>that level.</v>

316
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:07.771
<v Speaker 1>His debts,</v>

317
00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:08.310
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

318
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

319
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:13.780
<v Speaker 1>he was something ridiculous like 37 and know as a kickboxer and his UFC career,</v>

320
00:09:13.891 --> 00:09:18.030
<v Speaker 1>he's only lost a matte brown and fight where he said he overtrained for that</v>

321
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:18.361
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

322
00:09:18.361 --> 00:09:18.751
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

323
00:09:18.751 --> 00:09:22.140
<v Speaker 1>Matt is obviously a savage and early in his UFC career too.</v>

324
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

325
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:23.460
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

326
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:24.510
<v Speaker 1>So there's the first fight,</v>

327
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:25.733
<v Speaker 1>Joe Schilling,</v>

328
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:27.570
<v Speaker 1>and I know you're a huge fan of glory.</v>

329
00:09:27.571 --> 00:09:28.500
<v Speaker 1>The organization,</v>

330
00:09:28.501 --> 00:09:30.390
<v Speaker 1>the way they treat the fighters once they leave.</v>

331
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:31.531
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

332
00:09:31.531 --> 00:09:32.700
<v Speaker 1>We already discussed that.</v>

333
00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:34.260
<v Speaker 1>It's good,</v>

334
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.160
<v Speaker 1>it's good for the sport.</v>

335
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.780
<v Speaker 1>It's good that,</v>

336
00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:36.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

337
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:37.950
<v Speaker 1>like Laurie has done for kickboxing.</v>

338
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:38.880
<v Speaker 1>This is awesome.</v>

339
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.420
<v Speaker 1>This is great.</v>

340
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.560
<v Speaker 1>It is good for the sport.</v>

341
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:41.700
<v Speaker 1>I love the sport.</v>

342
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:42.563
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

343
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:44.000
<v Speaker 1>and I think everyone here,</v>

344
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.360
<v Speaker 1>we want it to do better.</v>

345
00:09:45.361 --> 00:09:45.930
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

346
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:50.100
<v Speaker 1>it's doesn't get nearly the amount of attention or respect that it deserves.</v>

347
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:50.371
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

348
00:09:50.371 --> 00:09:50.941
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

349
00:09:50.941 --> 00:09:51.930
<v Speaker 1>It should definitely,</v>

350
00:09:51.931 --> 00:09:52.201
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

351
00:09:52.201 --> 00:09:53.070
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing is,</v>

352
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.910
<v Speaker 1>is a very exciting sport when you,</v>

353
00:09:54.911 --> 00:09:55.651
<v Speaker 1>and you sit down,</v>

354
00:09:55.651 --> 00:09:58.620
<v Speaker 1>you watch these guys and you see some of the knockouts guys pull off.</v>

355
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:00.001
<v Speaker 1>I was watching,</v>

356
00:10:00.001 --> 00:10:01.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm Tyrone Spong and,</v>

357
00:10:01.321 --> 00:10:01.671
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

358
00:10:01.671 --> 00:10:05.520
<v Speaker 1>and Solow Calamari.</v>

359
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:06.530
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

360
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:06.781
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

361
00:10:06.781 --> 00:10:09.120
<v Speaker 1>and the way he cracked him with that overhead.</v>

362
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:14.150
<v Speaker 1>I love seeing guys get hurt but survive get through that round because you get a</v>

363
00:10:14.941 --> 00:10:15.441
<v Speaker 1>guy like,</v>

364
00:10:15.441 --> 00:10:17.880
<v Speaker 1>like title and spawn was a killer and he's coming after you.</v>

365
00:10:17.881 --> 00:10:18.780
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to finish,</v>

366
00:10:18.781 --> 00:10:20.870
<v Speaker 1>but you have to be smart brains.</v>

367
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:22.620
<v Speaker 1>When you dropped Tyrone in New York,</v>

368
00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:23.790
<v Speaker 1>that was a Michael Dunn.</v>

369
00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.000
<v Speaker 1>I think Tyrone got up and they knocked them out.</v>

370
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

371
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.631
<v Speaker 1>White guy over here.</v>

372
00:10:28.631 --> 00:10:29.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

373
00:10:29.191 --> 00:10:30.360
<v Speaker 1>That was crazy.</v>

374
00:10:30.361 --> 00:10:30.960
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

375
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.990
<v Speaker 1>that was because that whole exchange was 30 seconds.</v>

376
00:10:33.991 --> 00:10:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

377
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:35.483
<v Speaker 1>He dropped,</v>

378
00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:39.120
<v Speaker 1>he dropped Tyron and t and then Tyrone got back up and knocked him out.</v>

379
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:40.140
<v Speaker 1>I just flashed him.</v>

380
00:10:40.141 --> 00:10:40.351
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

381
00:10:40.351 --> 00:10:40.430
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

382
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:40.661
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

383
00:10:40.661 --> 00:10:44.250
<v Speaker 1>two down the pipe and Tom Bonds in a weird place,</v>

384
00:10:44.251 --> 00:10:45.084
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

385
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:45.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

386
00:10:45.241 --> 00:10:45.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

387
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what these kind of halfway kickboxing,</v>

388
00:10:48.001 --> 00:10:50.100
<v Speaker 1>halfway boxing is boxing now.</v>

389
00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:51.930
<v Speaker 1>He has a boxing fight recently.</v>

390
00:10:51.931 --> 00:10:52.260
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

391
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:53.093
<v Speaker 1>He's had a few,</v>

392
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:53.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

393
00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:54.660
<v Speaker 1>when he broke his leg,</v>

394
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.201
<v Speaker 1>when he fought,</v>

395
00:10:55.201 --> 00:10:56.034
<v Speaker 1>go Saki.</v>

396
00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:58.500
<v Speaker 1>That was another one of those Anderson Silva style.</v>

397
00:10:58.501 --> 00:10:59.910
<v Speaker 1>Leg breaks is nasty.</v>

398
00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:00.690
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

399
00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:01.890
<v Speaker 1>check leg breaks.</v>

400
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:02.730
<v Speaker 1>It was bad.</v>

401
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:03.410
<v Speaker 1>You see that one?</v>

402
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

403
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.850
<v Speaker 1>I saw that disgusting.</v>

404
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.420
<v Speaker 1>How many times have you seen that Joe in the flesh and the flesh?</v>

405
00:11:09.421 --> 00:11:10.000
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>

406
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.580
<v Speaker 1>I would never see it in the flesh.</v>

407
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:12.660
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it twice.</v>

408
00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:13.951
<v Speaker 1>Corey Hill,</v>

409
00:11:13.951 --> 00:11:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Corey Hill,</v>

410
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.150
<v Speaker 1>and answer for that too.</v>

411
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:21.060
<v Speaker 1>What I hate about that is your body's still reacting.</v>

412
00:11:21.061 --> 00:11:23.130
<v Speaker 1>You throw in that kick and you're putting that foot down.</v>

413
00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:24.413
<v Speaker 1>You don't feel it.</v>

414
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Now you put that foot down,</v>

415
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.760
<v Speaker 1>then you see it goes rubber on you.</v>

416
00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Kelly's touching the side of your knee.</v>

417
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

418
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.210
<v Speaker 1>that's gotta be so hard to get over that.</v>

419
00:11:36.211 --> 00:11:40.690
<v Speaker 1>To the point where you're capable of throwing kicks to like to the mentally</v>

420
00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:41.790
<v Speaker 1>convinced mental,</v>

421
00:11:41.791 --> 00:11:42.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

422
00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:43.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

423
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:43.913
<v Speaker 1>it's real tough.</v>

424
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Real tough to come by from.</v>

425
00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.013
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

426
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:46.591
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

427
00:11:46.591 --> 00:11:47.350
<v Speaker 1>And well,</v>

428
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:47.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

429
00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:52.320
<v Speaker 1>blegh break in and of itself is so dangerous because first of all when it gets,</v>

430
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.680
<v Speaker 1>when it's a compound fracture,</v>

431
00:11:53.681 --> 00:11:54.310
<v Speaker 1>it's insanely</v>

432
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:56.530
<v Speaker 2>dangerous cause there's massive risks of infection.</v>

433
00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.510
<v Speaker 2>But when it's a,</v>

434
00:11:58.540 --> 00:11:58.861
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

435
00:11:58.861 --> 00:11:59.770
<v Speaker 2>a leg break,</v>

436
00:11:59.771 --> 00:12:02.260
<v Speaker 2>there's also an issue with circulation.</v>

437
00:12:02.261 --> 00:12:03.790
<v Speaker 2>Like Frank Mir,</v>

438
00:12:03.791 --> 00:12:04.630
<v Speaker 2>when he broke his leg,</v>

439
00:12:04.631 --> 00:12:05.800
<v Speaker 2>when he got in that car accident,</v>

440
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:07.930
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't good for a year,</v>

441
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:12.990
<v Speaker 2>a year plus his leg was fucked up for like a year later and his knee was fucked</v>

442
00:12:13.961 --> 00:12:14.794
<v Speaker 2>up from,</v>

443
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.633
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

444
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:19.720
<v Speaker 2>having his leg bolted together and kind of fucked up as knee.</v>

445
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.630
<v Speaker 2>What bothers me most about that is how much pain those dudes are in instantly.</v>

446
00:12:25.631 --> 00:12:25.931
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

447
00:12:25.931 --> 00:12:27.580
<v Speaker 2>when you're in a fight and you get cut,</v>

448
00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:28.121
<v Speaker 2>you get hit,</v>

449
00:12:28.121 --> 00:12:29.050
<v Speaker 2>you get like,</v>

450
00:12:29.051 --> 00:12:29.884
<v Speaker 2>you feel it,</v>

451
00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:32.530
<v Speaker 2>but it's like you can deal with it like that.</v>

452
00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:33.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

453
00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.220
<v Speaker 2>They just look like they're in agony right away.</v>

454
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.350
<v Speaker 2>That adrenaline is not enough to stop that pain.</v>

455
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:37.631
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

456
00:12:37.631 --> 00:12:40.450
<v Speaker 2>nobody just sucks it up when their legs snaps in half.</v>

457
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:42.670
<v Speaker 2>That Andersen,</v>

458
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.910
<v Speaker 2>when Andersen fog Weidman and he's just screaming,</v>

459
00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:46.181
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

460
00:12:46.181 --> 00:12:48.250
<v Speaker 2>you never see that from Anderson ever.</v>

461
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:49.480
<v Speaker 2>There was one,</v>

462
00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.530
<v Speaker 2>I had a fight once.</v>

463
00:12:50.531 --> 00:12:50.831
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>

464
00:12:50.831 --> 00:12:54.850
<v Speaker 2>you had said something about how I'm good at throwing that inside leg kick.</v>

465
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:55.871
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

466
00:12:55.871 --> 00:12:56.201
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

467
00:12:56.201 --> 00:12:57.430
<v Speaker 2>when I watched it later I was like yeah,</v>

468
00:12:57.431 --> 00:12:58.780
<v Speaker 2>cause I don't wanna get my shit broken.</v>

469
00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:02.550
<v Speaker 2>I tried to hide that as best as I can be in a south bum.</v>

470
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:03.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

471
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.300
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's the scariest thing right inside leg kick to that Shin on the</v>

472
00:13:07.301 --> 00:13:08.440
<v Speaker 2>opposite side fighter.</v>

473
00:13:08.441 --> 00:13:09.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

474
00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.500
<v Speaker 2>That the South Palsy ruin it when it happens.</v>

475
00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:17.330
<v Speaker 2>I said Tyrone was just like full power and that sockies knee like oh yeah.</v>

476
00:13:17.861 --> 00:13:18.760
<v Speaker 2>Full power.</v>

477
00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:20.680
<v Speaker 2>And that's Tyrone style too.</v>

478
00:13:20.681 --> 00:13:21.560
<v Speaker 2>He's just such a,</v>

479
00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:22.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

480
00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:23.740
<v Speaker 2>explosive guy.</v>

481
00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:28.390
<v Speaker 2>Like what a boss said about it made a lot of sense to me where he described it</v>

482
00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:29.170
<v Speaker 2>as like a,</v>

483
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:30.003
<v Speaker 2>like a ruler,</v>

484
00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:31.181
<v Speaker 2>Pencil,</v>

485
00:13:31.181 --> 00:13:32.014
<v Speaker 2>ruler.</v>

486
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:33.003
<v Speaker 2>And when you hit,</v>

487
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:33.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

488
00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:34.301
<v Speaker 2>the South Pole,</v>

489
00:13:34.301 --> 00:13:38.140
<v Speaker 2>you ended up kind of boss explains a lot better than maybe what the,</v>

490
00:13:38.141 --> 00:13:38.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

491
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:41.720
<v Speaker 2>the ruler hits the flat side of the Shin Hits like the floods out.</v>

492
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.880
<v Speaker 2>Why has the ability to break so easy versus going straight out of that totally</v>

493
00:13:45.881 --> 00:13:46.714
<v Speaker 2>makes sense.</v>

494
00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.700
<v Speaker 2>And then there's of course the knee and the upper air,</v>

495
00:13:48.701 --> 00:13:48.991
<v Speaker 2>the need,</v>

496
00:13:48.991 --> 00:13:51.070
<v Speaker 2>which is just like kicking a boulder,</v>

497
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:51.761
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

498
00:13:51.761 --> 00:13:53.650
<v Speaker 2>it's like the top of the knee especially.</v>

499
00:13:53.651 --> 00:13:54.550
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard.</v>

500
00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:55.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

501
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:56.500
<v Speaker 2>And the top of the Shin to,</v>

502
00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:56.741
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

503
00:13:56.741 --> 00:13:56.930
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

504
00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:57.763
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

505
00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.000
<v Speaker 2>your Shin is a sharp or toward the bottom,</v>

506
00:14:01.001 --> 00:14:01.930
<v Speaker 2>but it gets much thicker,</v>

507
00:14:01.931 --> 00:14:02.561
<v Speaker 2>much denser.</v>

508
00:14:02.561 --> 00:14:02.801
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

509
00:14:02.801 --> 00:14:03.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

510
00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:04.071
<v Speaker 2>he felt like a,</v>

511
00:14:04.071 --> 00:14:07.150
<v Speaker 2>a solid leg kicking you land on the upper Shin is when you really get like the</v>

512
00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.050
<v Speaker 2>funk.</v>

513
00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:09.970
<v Speaker 2>I remember there was a fight and lion fight.</v>

514
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember who mallet pet fought,</v>

515
00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:12.430
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

516
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:13.300
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

517
00:14:13.301 --> 00:14:13.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

518
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:14.620
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

519
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.260
<v Speaker 2>the dude checked his leg kick and it hurt him.</v>

520
00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:18.640
<v Speaker 2>He could tell it hurt him.</v>

521
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:23.670
<v Speaker 2>So Mal pet started swinging at his shins and he just kept throwing those leg</v>

522
00:14:24.011 --> 00:14:24.280
<v Speaker 2>kicks.</v>

523
00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.091
<v Speaker 2>Adis Shins.</v>

524
00:14:25.091 --> 00:14:26.440
<v Speaker 2>It was just so nasty.</v>

525
00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:27.540
<v Speaker 2>It was that that was,</v>

526
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:28.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember who it was.</v>

527
00:14:28.541 --> 00:14:30.020
<v Speaker 2>I remember it and I don't think I saw that.</v>

528
00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:31.070
<v Speaker 2>It was one of it.</v>

529
00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:32.650
<v Speaker 2>Was that when Cyborg flood on that car?</v>

530
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.240
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

531
00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:34.840
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

532
00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:35.630
<v Speaker 2>might've been,</v>

533
00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:36.131
<v Speaker 2>it might've been,</v>

534
00:14:36.131 --> 00:14:36.964
<v Speaker 2>might've been.</v>

535
00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.560
<v Speaker 2>I train them out of the pet man,</v>

536
00:14:38.561 --> 00:14:39.160
<v Speaker 2>that guy,</v>

537
00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:39.431
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

538
00:14:39.431 --> 00:14:43.660
<v Speaker 2>a ballot that means no diamond and that guy,</v>

539
00:14:43.661 --> 00:14:46.390
<v Speaker 2>his shins are like diamond heart.</v>

540
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:50.260
<v Speaker 2>We were drilling one day and we're going back and forth and I throw a kick and</v>

541
00:14:50.261 --> 00:14:51.094
<v Speaker 2>he checked me,</v>

542
00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 2>he throws a kick</v>

543
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.551
<v Speaker 1>and I check him.</v>

544
00:14:52.551 --> 00:14:53.540
<v Speaker 1>He's not kicking me hard.</v>

545
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:55.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's literally kicking like that hard.</v>

546
00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.070
<v Speaker 1>And I checked it and I didn't like how it felt.</v>

547
00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.130
<v Speaker 1>So I saw him doing a kick again and I seriously thought,</v>

548
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:05.390
<v Speaker 1>don't even block that cause where he's not kicking you hard so it's not going to</v>

549
00:15:05.391 --> 00:15:05.750
<v Speaker 1>hurt.</v>

550
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:06.770
<v Speaker 1>But if you check it at will,</v>

551
00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:07.610
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

552
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:08.410
<v Speaker 1>The bad guy.</v>

553
00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:08.770
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

554
00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:09.411
<v Speaker 1>he's little,</v>

555
00:15:09.411 --> 00:15:10.011
<v Speaker 1>he's tiny,</v>

556
00:15:10.011 --> 00:15:11.060
<v Speaker 1>but he hits so hard,</v>

557
00:15:11.061 --> 00:15:12.020
<v Speaker 1>can't clench with him.</v>

558
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Beats me up in the clinch.</v>

559
00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:15.410
<v Speaker 1>I got like 2030 pounds on him.</v>

560
00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.450
<v Speaker 1>It's beaten me up so much experience.</v>

561
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:18.410
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

562
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:18.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

563
00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:19.850
<v Speaker 1>they call it old bones.</v>

564
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:20.751
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

565
00:15:20.751 --> 00:15:22.460
<v Speaker 1>They start when they're babies.</v>

566
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:23.750
<v Speaker 1>Old Bones.</v>

567
00:15:23.751 --> 00:15:26.410
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting way to put it in until the ties referred to them.</v>

568
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.460
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the same with grappling to,</v>

569
00:15:28.461 --> 00:15:30.620
<v Speaker 1>you ever wrestle with a guy like Randy coture?</v>

570
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.680
<v Speaker 1>He clinch up with a guy like that and there's just something about them when</v>

571
00:15:33.681 --> 00:15:35.720
<v Speaker 1>they've been throwing people around their whole life,</v>

572
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:37.670
<v Speaker 1>they got this weird feel to them.</v>

573
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:38.750
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't feel right.</v>

574
00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:39.683
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

575
00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:40.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

576
00:15:40.101 --> 00:15:41.350
<v Speaker 1>I trained with Tyron when he,</v>

577
00:15:41.351 --> 00:15:42.890
<v Speaker 1>he had a broken arm at the time,</v>

578
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:44.030
<v Speaker 1>so he's in a cast.</v>

579
00:15:44.031 --> 00:15:45.140
<v Speaker 1>He's not even using it.</v>

580
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.273
<v Speaker 1>I can't do anything.</v>

581
00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:48.050
<v Speaker 1>He's lifted me with one hand.</v>

582
00:15:48.051 --> 00:15:49.780
<v Speaker 1>He's putting me on the fancy word,</v>

583
00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:50.720
<v Speaker 1>straight wrestling,</v>

584
00:15:50.721 --> 00:15:54.710
<v Speaker 1>but it's like he's wrestling with the child and he had shot passed on and the</v>

585
00:15:54.711 --> 00:15:55.280
<v Speaker 1>cast.</v>

586
00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:55.961
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

587
00:15:55.961 --> 00:15:59.360
<v Speaker 1>And he wrestled with another guy that wrestled that at Missouri also and took</v>

588
00:15:59.361 --> 00:16:00.170
<v Speaker 1>him down.</v>

589
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:01.820
<v Speaker 1>And this is a college level wrestler?</v>

590
00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:07.640
<v Speaker 1>Well Woodley's so unusual in that he has unbelievable knockout power,</v>

591
00:16:07.641 --> 00:16:09.440
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't start out as a striker.</v>

592
00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:10.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

593
00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:15.100
<v Speaker 1>he's just snap an explosion that he's got his ability to like close the distance</v>

594
00:16:16.071 --> 00:16:16.890
<v Speaker 1>with one punch too.</v>

595
00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:17.930
<v Speaker 1>I really noticed it.</v>

596
00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:18.710
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>

597
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:19.820
<v Speaker 1>I've noticed that in many fights,</v>

598
00:16:19.821 --> 00:16:22.670
<v Speaker 1>but the one time when he fought Carlos condit,</v>

599
00:16:22.671 --> 00:16:25.070
<v Speaker 1>I remember he closed the distance and land at the right hand.</v>

600
00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:29.810
<v Speaker 1>You know how your brain sees people doing stuff and things seemed normal.</v>

601
00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Like oh that's a good punch or that's a good kick,</v>

602
00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:33.050
<v Speaker 1>but it seems normal.</v>

603
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:35.000
<v Speaker 1>But every now and then someone will do something and you go,</v>

604
00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:35.451
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

605
00:16:35.451 --> 00:16:36.021
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

606
00:16:36.021 --> 00:16:36.280
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

607
00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.000
<v Speaker 1>we just miss a couple of frames there.</v>

608
00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Like it was like something was cut out of the fray.</v>

609
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:41.760
<v Speaker 1>He's so fast.</v>

610
00:16:41.761 --> 00:16:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

611
00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.970
<v Speaker 1>And for a guy that's that big,</v>

612
00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:46.610
<v Speaker 1>to be able to close the distance so fast and punch you,</v>

613
00:16:46.611 --> 00:16:47.360
<v Speaker 1>he like,</v>

614
00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.100
<v Speaker 1>you could tell like condit was like,</v>

615
00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:49.461
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

616
00:16:49.461 --> 00:16:50.294
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

617
00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:50.750
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

618
00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:52.690
<v Speaker 1>And this mother fucker could punch me from over there.</v>

619
00:16:52.691 --> 00:16:53.524
<v Speaker 1>Like this is,</v>

620
00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:54.890
<v Speaker 1>this is a whole different kind of thing.</v>

621
00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.210
<v Speaker 3>I think that's how a lot of people feel when they're fighting</v>

622
00:16:59.050 --> 00:16:59.883
<v Speaker 3>Wonderboy now.</v>

623
00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:00.370
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

624
00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:00.700
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

625
00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:01.001
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

626
00:17:01.001 --> 00:17:02.190
<v Speaker 3>you're talking earlier about his,</v>

627
00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:03.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

628
00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.290
<v Speaker 3>with a high level striker,</v>

629
00:17:04.291 --> 00:17:04.621
<v Speaker 3>he is,</v>

630
00:17:04.621 --> 00:17:08.000
<v Speaker 3>but he's a high level striker at a style that you don't see very often.</v>

631
00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.320
<v Speaker 3>And you're going to MMA gym anywhere across the country.</v>

632
00:17:10.321 --> 00:17:14.370
<v Speaker 3>You're going to see fundamentals of Muy Thai boxing and whatnot.</v>

633
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:14.821
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

634
00:17:14.821 --> 00:17:15.330
<v Speaker 3>Be Barely,</v>

635
00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:19.260
<v Speaker 3>rarely are going to see guys throwing late up Cresson kicks and all this fucking</v>

636
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.981
<v Speaker 3>karate point.</v>

637
00:17:19.981 --> 00:17:20.814
<v Speaker 3>Karate Shit.</v>

638
00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:24.000
<v Speaker 3>I am in a Raymond Daniels similar style.</v>

639
00:17:24.001 --> 00:17:24.511
<v Speaker 3>When you're in there,</v>

640
00:17:24.511 --> 00:17:24.751
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

641
00:17:24.751 --> 00:17:26.220
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is going on?</v>

642
00:17:26.221 --> 00:17:27.570
<v Speaker 3>And then he ended up standing in front of them,</v>

643
00:17:27.571 --> 00:17:28.404
<v Speaker 3>which is what they want.</v>

644
00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:28.901
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

645
00:17:28.901 --> 00:17:30.960
<v Speaker 1>he's got way better hands and Raymond now,</v>

646
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:31.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

647
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.060
<v Speaker 1>The thing that makes him like Raymond is getting better with his hands,</v>

648
00:17:34.061 --> 00:17:37.180
<v Speaker 1>but Raymond has issues when guys close the distance and smother him,</v>

649
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:40.710
<v Speaker 1>like with Niki holds can did like with Joseph Valtellina did to him.</v>

650
00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:41.931
<v Speaker 1>But wonder what,</v>

651
00:17:41.931 --> 00:17:44.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any problem with that and wonder where his hands are nasty.</v>

652
00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:48.340
<v Speaker 1>And he also has this weird thing he does where he pivots from his hip back and</v>

653
00:17:48.341 --> 00:17:52.500
<v Speaker 1>forth like a fucking snake and like he's so good at like moving back and forth</v>

654
00:17:52.501 --> 00:17:53.334
<v Speaker 1>from his hips.</v>

655
00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:56.100
<v Speaker 1>And that's like a lot of that point karate stuff.</v>

656
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:57.143
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

657
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

658
00:17:57.691 --> 00:17:58.524
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

659
00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:02.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited about that flavor because of those two dynamics.</v>

660
00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.120
<v Speaker 1>Because the tire and speed and one,</v>

661
00:18:04.121 --> 00:18:05.580
<v Speaker 1>one boy's got good range too,</v>

662
00:18:05.581 --> 00:18:07.080
<v Speaker 1>but tiring can close that gap.</v>

663
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.630
<v Speaker 1>And then one of the boys creativity with,</v>

664
00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:09.871
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

665
00:18:09.871 --> 00:18:10.830
<v Speaker 1>with what he does,</v>

666
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.450
<v Speaker 1>like he throws everything at you.</v>

667
00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:14.970
<v Speaker 1>Tyrons got that one punch power though.</v>

668
00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.630
<v Speaker 1>That one punch thing is just so disturbing because he could just,</v>

669
00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:23.040
<v Speaker 1>the last fight with Lawler was out of nowhere.</v>

670
00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:23.840
<v Speaker 1>Nowhere.</v>

671
00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.810
<v Speaker 1>And he can do that at any point in time to anybody.</v>

672
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:27.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

673
00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:27.720
<v Speaker 1>To anybody.</v>

674
00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.250
<v Speaker 1>And there's no one that can take that shot.</v>

675
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:29.611
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>

676
00:18:29.611 --> 00:18:29.780
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

677
00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:30.780
<v Speaker 1>you can't get hit by it.</v>

678
00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:31.800
<v Speaker 1>You can't get hit like that.</v>

679
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:36.000
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Wonderboy is much more of an accumulation type,</v>

680
00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:36.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

681
00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:37.740
<v Speaker 1>damaged door.</v>

682
00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:39.840
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

683
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:40.181
<v Speaker 1>wonder boy,</v>

684
00:18:40.181 --> 00:18:41.130
<v Speaker 1>he's been hit before.</v>

685
00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:41.551
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

686
00:18:41.551 --> 00:18:46.530
<v Speaker 1>like you gotta think Jake Ellenberger hit him and hurt him and uh,</v>

687
00:18:46.531 --> 00:18:46.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

688
00:18:46.801 --> 00:18:47.940
<v Speaker 1>Jake's got real power to,</v>

689
00:18:47.941 --> 00:18:49.620
<v Speaker 1>of course he hit him and hurt him.</v>

690
00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:51.690
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

691
00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:56.400
<v Speaker 1>it's really a matter of whether or not he can stay the fuck away for,</v>

692
00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:57.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

693
00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:59.130
<v Speaker 1>as long as it takes a slow tyrant down.</v>

694
00:18:59.150 --> 00:18:59.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

695
00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:02.790
<v Speaker 1>And then get his hit the weird game that he has,</v>

696
00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.280
<v Speaker 1>particularly with his front leg,</v>

697
00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:08.790
<v Speaker 1>he can do shit with his front leg that you just do not expect.</v>

698
00:19:08.791 --> 00:19:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Front leg sidekicks,</v>

699
00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:10.801
<v Speaker 1>front leg,</v>

700
00:19:10.801 --> 00:19:11.461
<v Speaker 1>roundhouse kicks.</v>

701
00:19:11.461 --> 00:19:15.870
<v Speaker 1>He's sneak some over the shoulder and drops him down on you throwing that lead</v>

702
00:19:15.871 --> 00:19:16.704
<v Speaker 1>leg hook kick.</v>

703
00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:17.823
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

704
00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:18.541
<v Speaker 1>That's that shit.</v>

705
00:19:18.541 --> 00:19:18.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

706
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:19.640
<v Speaker 1>like when you're like,</v>

707
00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.060
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on?</v>

708
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.850
<v Speaker 1>Worry.</v>

709
00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:25.530
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

710
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:26.251
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Hendricks.</v>

711
00:19:26.251 --> 00:19:26.521
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

712
00:19:26.521 --> 00:19:27.171
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

713
00:19:27.171 --> 00:19:27.420
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

714
00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:28.253
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

715
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:28.621
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

716
00:19:28.621 --> 00:19:31.350
<v Speaker 1>And then now you're a target for that guy who was just doing his shit,</v>

717
00:19:31.351 --> 00:19:32.070
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

718
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:32.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

719
00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:32.970
<v Speaker 1>Scary.</v>

720
00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:33.151
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

721
00:19:33.151 --> 00:19:34.890
<v Speaker 1>that sideways stance too,</v>

722
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:39.480
<v Speaker 1>he stands like completely karate style sideways with his hands down and it's</v>

723
00:19:39.481 --> 00:19:40.440
<v Speaker 1>just a different thing.</v>

724
00:19:40.441 --> 00:19:42.240
<v Speaker 1>It's a totally different style of movement.</v>

725
00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:45.420
<v Speaker 1>And that was the one style of martial art that I was,</v>

726
00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.220
<v Speaker 1>I've been waiting for for a while.</v>

727
00:19:47.221 --> 00:19:48.730
<v Speaker 1>And you've seen it now with um,</v>

728
00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:49.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

729
00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Michael Page and Bella Tor to this style of the point karate guy.</v>

730
00:19:54.541 --> 00:19:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Those support guys who can,</v>

731
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.790
<v Speaker 1>they can close the distance so fast and get the fuck out of the way so fast.</v>

732
00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.600
<v Speaker 1>They're just a completely different thing and they're real good at countering to</v>

733
00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.450
<v Speaker 1>like Michael Page is a master at countering.</v>

734
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

735
00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:08.623
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

736
00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:12.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm not hating on Michael painted and hate that gangly pseudo style.</v>

737
00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:12.781
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude.</v>

738
00:20:12.781 --> 00:20:13.690
<v Speaker 1>The dancing stuff.</v>

739
00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:14.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>

740
00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.890
<v Speaker 1>Why do you hate it poly?</v>

741
00:20:16.891 --> 00:20:21.790
<v Speaker 1>Because I feel like I'm a classic like old school heart.</v>

742
00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Just put your notes to the grant and do it the right way.</v>

743
00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:25.290
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

744
00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:27.240
<v Speaker 1>But I understand that's his style,</v>

745
00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:29.830
<v Speaker 1>but for some reason it just bothers the hell out of it.</v>

746
00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:30.031
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

747
00:20:30.031 --> 00:20:32.490
<v Speaker 1>don't you think that's also a big part of why it's so effective?</v>

748
00:20:32.491 --> 00:20:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Because it bothers the fuck out of his opponents too.</v>

749
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:38.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like you do not want to get knocked out by a dude's gonna dance afterwards.</v>

750
00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:41.930
<v Speaker 1>Dance during dance.</v>

751
00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.360
<v Speaker 1>Right before he kaos you,</v>

752
00:20:43.361 --> 00:20:43.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

753
00:20:43.651 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Battersea Richard Abraham's up</v>

756
00:20:49.661 --> 00:20:51.400
<v Speaker 2>We haven't talked about a fight yet.</v>

757
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.440
<v Speaker 2>I like Abraham man.</v>

758
00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:53.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

759
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:54.700
<v Speaker 2>I like how he fights.</v>

760
00:20:54.701 --> 00:20:55.750
<v Speaker 2>He's pretty aggressive.</v>

761
00:20:55.751 --> 00:20:56.200
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

762
00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.520
<v Speaker 2>he likes to throw big bombs.</v>

763
00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:58.181
<v Speaker 2>I call,</v>

764
00:20:58.181 --> 00:20:59.200
<v Speaker 2>I call what he does.</v>

767
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.033
<v Speaker 2>Jitsu.</v>

768
00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.650
<v Speaker 2>How did you come up with Thug Jitsu man?</v>

769
00:21:08.651 --> 00:21:08.971
<v Speaker 2>There was,</v>

770
00:21:08.971 --> 00:21:10.330
<v Speaker 2>there was Houston was a big,</v>

771
00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:12.670
<v Speaker 2>a Jujitsu town and some,</v>

772
00:21:12.671 --> 00:21:14.980
<v Speaker 2>somebody was using it as like trying to denigrate me.</v>

773
00:21:14.981 --> 00:21:15.191
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

774
00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:15.671
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>

775
00:21:15.671 --> 00:21:16.504
<v Speaker 2>if you want to,</v>

776
00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.100
<v Speaker 2>you want to train some good Jujitsu,</v>

777
00:21:18.101 --> 00:21:20.380
<v Speaker 2>you come over here and you train with this guy and this guy.</v>

778
00:21:20.381 --> 00:21:22.540
<v Speaker 2>But if you want to go learn some of that thug Jitsu,</v>

779
00:21:22.541 --> 00:21:25.120
<v Speaker 2>you go train with eve and Saul and those guys because,</v>

780
00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:29.500
<v Speaker 2>because we were doing kicks and punches knees and then they didn't like that.</v>

781
00:21:29.501 --> 00:21:31.960
<v Speaker 2>They just wanted to do some missions and do positioning and,</v>

782
00:21:31.961 --> 00:21:32.620
<v Speaker 2>and that was it.</v>

783
00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:36.580
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wanted to get hit in Houston back in the nineties Oh that's interesting.</v>

784
00:21:36.581 --> 00:21:38.890
<v Speaker 2>Joke's on you fucking ran with that shit.</v>

785
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:43.030
<v Speaker 2>I saw you fight for first time it hook and shoot dude against Aaron Riley.</v>

786
00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.310
<v Speaker 2>What year was that?</v>

787
00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.110
<v Speaker 2>That was the 90s right?</v>

788
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:48.230
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

789
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:52.590
<v Speaker 2>first time was the nineties I think the second time was 2001 no,</v>

790
00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.720
<v Speaker 2>2000 old school man.</v>

791
00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:55.971
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

792
00:21:55.971 --> 00:21:58.030
<v Speaker 2>that is as old school as you get right.</v>

793
00:21:58.460 --> 00:21:59.590
<v Speaker 2>Makes me feel old.</v>

794
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:02.470
<v Speaker 2>Those were great fights though,</v>

795
00:22:02.471 --> 00:22:03.304
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

796
00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:04.900
<v Speaker 2>Those are great fights.</v>

797
00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:07.203
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

798
00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:09.700
<v Speaker 2>it's weird cause I liked beaten up.</v>

799
00:22:09.701 --> 00:22:10.534
<v Speaker 2>Aaron Riley.</v>

800
00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:12.123
<v Speaker 2>Aaron was tough.</v>

801
00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:13.353
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

802
00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:14.830
<v Speaker 2>He was tough but he wouldn't stop.</v>

803
00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:16.090
<v Speaker 2>Like he wouldn't quit.</v>

804
00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:16.650
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

805
00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:16.860
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

806
00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:18.010
<v Speaker 2>the second time we fought,</v>

807
00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.610
<v Speaker 2>it was one point where I,</v>

808
00:22:19.611 --> 00:22:24.010
<v Speaker 2>Atlanta did a knee like to the face and then just saw blood immediately after.</v>

809
00:22:24.011 --> 00:22:25.240
<v Speaker 2>I surely felt like,</v>

810
00:22:25.241 --> 00:22:28.330
<v Speaker 2>felt like I need a burlap sack of light bulbs.</v>

811
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:29.583
<v Speaker 2>That's what it felt like.</v>

812
00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:31.840
<v Speaker 2>It was disgust.</v>

813
00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:32.720
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>

814
00:22:32.721 --> 00:22:34.220
<v Speaker 2>A burlap sack.</v>

815
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:40.000
<v Speaker 2>I remember thinking during the fight when that happened.</v>

816
00:22:40.001 --> 00:22:40.391
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

817
00:22:40.391 --> 00:22:41.580
<v Speaker 2>that felt like light bulbs.</v>

818
00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:42.850
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

819
00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:47.470
<v Speaker 2>What do you think it felt like when Michael Page landed that neon cyborg when</v>

820
00:22:47.471 --> 00:22:51.880
<v Speaker 2>its forehead Kayden Cyborg so crazy.</v>

821
00:22:51.881 --> 00:22:52.061
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

822
00:22:52.061 --> 00:22:53.260
<v Speaker 2>I'll be fighting to get in three months.</v>

823
00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:54.910
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

824
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:55.833
<v Speaker 2>I hope not.</v>

825
00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:56.710
<v Speaker 2>I hope not.</v>

826
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:59.770
<v Speaker 2>The way he went down to that was another one of those times when you see a guy</v>

827
00:22:59.771 --> 00:23:01.540
<v Speaker 2>in agony in the cage,</v>

828
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:03.760
<v Speaker 2>that's no man.</v>

829
00:23:03.761 --> 00:23:05.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I'm fighting after that.</v>

830
00:23:05.081 --> 00:23:06.430
<v Speaker 2>You can get hit in the head a lot.</v>

831
00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:11.050
<v Speaker 2>That's bugs the shit out of me the most about I pokes when when someone gets</v>

832
00:23:11.051 --> 00:23:14.320
<v Speaker 2>jabbed in the eye and you see him scream out and cover their eyes and turn their</v>

833
00:23:14.321 --> 00:23:16.720
<v Speaker 2>back then and we tried to defend themselves sometimes.</v>

834
00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:18.580
<v Speaker 2>Anthony Johnson one was the worst.</v>

835
00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:18.851
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

836
00:23:18.851 --> 00:23:19.690
<v Speaker 2>with Kevin Burns.</v>

837
00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:20.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

838
00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:21.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

839
00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.930
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a gang of them now,</v>

840
00:23:22.931 --> 00:23:23.764
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

841
00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:26.980
<v Speaker 2>I just don't know why they don't go to the pride gloves.</v>

842
00:23:26.981 --> 00:23:28.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean it just seemed at this point in time,</v>

843
00:23:28.991 --> 00:23:29.950
<v Speaker 2>like a no brainer.</v>

844
00:23:29.951 --> 00:23:31.720
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't make any sense to me whatsoever.</v>

845
00:23:31.721 --> 00:23:35.980
<v Speaker 2>They continue to have these gloves that not only is it hard to keep your hand</v>

846
00:23:35.981 --> 00:23:36.640
<v Speaker 2>curled,</v>

847
00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.420
<v Speaker 2>but it like it.</v>

848
00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:39.130
<v Speaker 2>It's trying to open your hands,</v>

849
00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:41.980
<v Speaker 2>like the UFC gloves are trying to open your hands,</v>

850
00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:43.360
<v Speaker 2>like to keep your hands close,</v>

851
00:23:43.361 --> 00:23:44.560
<v Speaker 2>you have to force them down.</v>

852
00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.190
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the pride gloves,</v>

853
00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:49.580
<v Speaker 1>it was hard to open them a prod gloves or keeping your hands like that.</v>

854
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:51.290
<v Speaker 1>So as you're throwing punches,</v>

855
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:52.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

856
00:23:52.641 --> 00:23:57.380
<v Speaker 1>I just think also two guys had the half to get away from doing this open palm</v>

857
00:23:57.381 --> 00:23:59.420
<v Speaker 1>thing to the face to push guys off.</v>

858
00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:01.220
<v Speaker 1>And I think when guys do that,</v>

859
00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:02.840
<v Speaker 1>they should be penalized at point.</v>

860
00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:03.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

861
00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:04.820
<v Speaker 1>how do you stop them from doing that?</v>

862
00:24:04.821 --> 00:24:05.930
<v Speaker 1>That's such an instinct.</v>

863
00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:06.890
<v Speaker 1>It is an instinct,</v>

864
00:24:06.891 --> 00:24:08.600
<v Speaker 1>but I think some guys don't do whatever.</v>

865
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.901
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

866
00:24:08.901 --> 00:24:10.310
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of fighters who never,</v>

867
00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:11.840
<v Speaker 1>never guilty of I pokes.</v>

868
00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:12.980
<v Speaker 1>So why is that?</v>

869
00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not like it's impossible to avoid.</v>

870
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:18.260
<v Speaker 1>I think they just have to make it so that if you poke somebody in the eye,</v>

871
00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:20.810
<v Speaker 1>it's an instantaneous one point deduction.</v>

872
00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:21.681
<v Speaker 1>And people say,</v>

873
00:24:21.681 --> 00:24:22.660
<v Speaker 1>well that's too harsh.</v>

874
00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:23.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

875
00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:24.170
<v Speaker 1>they didn't mean to do it.</v>

876
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.430
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they didn't mean to do it,</v>

877
00:24:25.431 --> 00:24:26.960
<v Speaker 1>but it still was done.</v>

878
00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:29.390
<v Speaker 1>So the opponents still suffered damage,</v>

879
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:30.910
<v Speaker 1>you know when you poke somebody in the eye,</v>

880
00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:34.130
<v Speaker 1>how many times do you see like a Matt Mitre on Travis Brown fight where a guy</v>

881
00:24:34.131 --> 00:24:37.880
<v Speaker 1>gets poked in the eye and also in the whole fight changes and then one guy's in</v>

882
00:24:37.881 --> 00:24:39.950
<v Speaker 1>trouble and he's not in trouble from a legal technique.</v>

883
00:24:39.951 --> 00:24:42.870
<v Speaker 1>He's in trouble from getting poked and then the dynamic of the fight changes.</v>

884
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:43.850
<v Speaker 1>He can't see so good.</v>

885
00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:45.320
<v Speaker 1>And then he winds up getting fucked up.</v>

886
00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:46.550
<v Speaker 1>See they should just stop,</v>

887
00:24:46.551 --> 00:24:48.950
<v Speaker 1>walk to the guy over a good look and then</v>

888
00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:53.240
<v Speaker 1>come back at five minutes.</v>

889
00:24:53.241 --> 00:24:54.650
<v Speaker 1>So we'll see that.</v>

890
00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:55.610
<v Speaker 1>That would be crazy.</v>

891
00:24:55.611 --> 00:24:57.200
<v Speaker 1>Manage of guys were allowed to poke you.</v>

892
00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:58.790
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you poke someone in the eye.</v>

893
00:24:58.791 --> 00:25:00.740
<v Speaker 1>They're allowed to come over and they get a free poke.</v>

894
00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:02.130
<v Speaker 1>Love it.</v>

895
00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:03.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh wasn't that,</v>

896
00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.320
<v Speaker 1>wasn't that one of the first rules that was like,</v>

897
00:25:06.321 --> 00:25:06.840
<v Speaker 1>it was just like,</v>

898
00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:07.673
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

899
00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:07.901
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

900
00:25:07.901 --> 00:25:08.734
<v Speaker 1>It was just no,</v>

901
00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:10.930
<v Speaker 1>no fish hooking or something.</v>

902
00:25:10.931 --> 00:25:11.631
<v Speaker 1>No fish hooking.</v>

903
00:25:11.631 --> 00:25:12.110
<v Speaker 1>No idea.</v>

904
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:12.450
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

905
00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:14.000
<v Speaker 1>I college and you were allowed to grab hair.</v>

906
00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:15.230
<v Speaker 1>You were allowed to punch nuts.</v>

907
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Keith Hackney.</v>

908
00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:20.250
<v Speaker 1>But some guys just have done it so many times on Joe San.</v>

909
00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:21.093
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

910
00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:22.221
<v Speaker 1>How crazy.</v>

911
00:25:22.221 --> 00:25:23.300
<v Speaker 1>That Joe's Han story.</v>

912
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:24.410
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the craziest stories.</v>

913
00:25:24.411 --> 00:25:24.891
<v Speaker 1>And all of them,</v>

914
00:25:24.891 --> 00:25:25.670
<v Speaker 1>I may,</v>

915
00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Joe San,</v>

916
00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.120
<v Speaker 1>who seemed like this lovable guy who was really into Jesus,</v>

917
00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:30.020
<v Speaker 1>it seemed kind of crazy.</v>

918
00:25:30.021 --> 00:25:31.520
<v Speaker 1>He used to come to the comedy store and hang out,</v>

919
00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:35.300
<v Speaker 1>hung out with Joe Shaw sign a bunch of times because he was friends with Bobby</v>

920
00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:35.690
<v Speaker 1>Lee.</v>

921
00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:36.790
<v Speaker 1>So He'd come down to the commerce talk.</v>

922
00:25:36.791 --> 00:25:37.541
<v Speaker 1>He was jacked.</v>

923
00:25:37.541 --> 00:25:39.830
<v Speaker 1>It was three feet tall and two feet wide.</v>

924
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:41.390
<v Speaker 1>He was jacked,</v>

925
00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:41.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

926
00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:43.220
<v Speaker 1>and he would,</v>

00:25:43.221 --> 00:25:43.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

928
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:44.750
<v Speaker 1>he was just real weird.</v>

929
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:46.580
<v Speaker 1>It felt like almost dangerous around.</v>

930
00:25:46.581 --> 00:25:46.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

931
00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:47.110
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda,</v>

932
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:48.230
<v Speaker 1>it's just seems so odd.</v>

933
00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.570
<v Speaker 1>And then they do some,</v>

934
00:25:50.571 --> 00:25:55.100
<v Speaker 1>he got arrested for something and they do some random DNA test on them and find</v>

935
00:25:55.101 --> 00:25:56.630
<v Speaker 1>out he was a part of a gang rape.</v>

936
00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.510
<v Speaker 1>And now he's in jail for life.</v>

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:06.170
<v Speaker 1>Killed a cellmate.</v>

942

943
00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:08.840
<v Speaker 1>See if that's the case.</v>

944
00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:10.540
<v Speaker 1>Joe Sohn Kills Cell Mate.</v>

945
00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:11.413
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure he did.</v>

946
00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:13.341
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:22.220
<v Speaker 1>I forget what they arrested him for two,</v>

953
00:26:22.221 --> 00:26:22.750
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

954
00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:23.141
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

955
00:26:23.141 --> 00:26:24.890
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't anything like that.</v>

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:32.780
<v Speaker 1>Rapist.</v>

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:34.100
<v Speaker 1>A possible murder for sure.</v>

964
00:26:34.101 --> 00:26:34.934
<v Speaker 1>Rapist.</v>

965
00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:39.140
<v Speaker 1>I remember when he walked into the cage with a fucking cross strapped to his</v>

966
00:26:39.141 --> 00:26:39.561
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

967
00:26:39.561 --> 00:26:40.580
<v Speaker 1>him and chemo,</v>

968
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:41.540
<v Speaker 1>both those guys,</v>

969
00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:43.950
<v Speaker 1>it was so up with Jesus.</v>

970
00:26:43.951 --> 00:26:47.040
<v Speaker 1>They had a walk to the cage with a cross strapped to their back.</v>

971
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:49.050
<v Speaker 1>Even Jesus himself and be like,</v>

972
00:26:49.051 --> 00:26:49.321
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

973
00:26:49.321 --> 00:26:49.591
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

974
00:26:49.591 --> 00:26:50.424
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

975
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:52.080
<v Speaker 1>that was a long time ago.</v>

976
00:26:52.081 --> 00:26:53.610
<v Speaker 1>We don't need to do this anymore.</v>

977
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Cause his cellmate was a convicted child molester.</v>

978
00:26:58.741 --> 00:26:59.700
<v Speaker 1>So and did he kill him?</v>

979
00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:00.563
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

980
00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.000
<v Speaker 1>he was standing over the body off him.</v>

981
00:27:03.001 --> 00:27:05.810
<v Speaker 1>So he was found standing at the door with cell,</v>

982
00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:06.661
<v Speaker 1>the body of his cellmate,</v>

983
00:27:06.661 --> 00:27:08.400
<v Speaker 1>50 year old convicted child molester.</v>

984
00:27:08.401 --> 00:27:10.920
<v Speaker 1>Michael Graham was lying unresponsive in the bottom bunk.</v>

985
00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:12.630
<v Speaker 1>He's pronounced dead.</v>

986
00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:13.673
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

987
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.680
<v Speaker 1>Well I gave him a pass on that.</v>

988
00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Give them a pass on child molester.</v>

989
00:27:18.421 --> 00:27:21.810
<v Speaker 1>He said he killed grant with a combination of kicks and punches.</v>

990
00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:22.201
<v Speaker 1>Sohn.</v>

991
00:27:22.201 --> 00:27:23.280
<v Speaker 1>Pleaded not guilty.</v>

992
00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

993
00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

994
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:27.850
<v Speaker 1>When you said son,</v>

995
00:27:27.851 --> 00:27:28.330
<v Speaker 1>I thought though.</v>

996
00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:29.380
<v Speaker 1>Cause you say that a lot.</v>

997
00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh son with a combination.</v>

998
00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:37.260
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1001
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:40.900
<v Speaker 1>Be a pretty good one.</v>

1002
00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:44.080
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was from wearing the why Colin his head one time I saw him fight,</v>

1003
00:27:44.081 --> 00:27:45.730
<v Speaker 1>but I guess that's a real mark on his head.</v>

1004
00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:46.001
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1005
00:27:46.001 --> 00:27:46.834

1012
00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:02.750
<v Speaker 1>I was like one 62.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Nate used to be 163 that's crazy.</v>

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:10.190
<v Speaker 1>He's back to one 85 now,</v>

1017
00:28:10.191 --> 00:28:10.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1018
00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:11.353
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1019
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:12.360
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

1020
00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:12.780
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>

1021
00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:14.000
<v Speaker 1>he just won by knockout.</v>

1022
00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:14.863
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1023
00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:15.680
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

1024
00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.070
<v Speaker 1>You'd be knocked out tandem or core with a head kick.</v>

1025
00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:21.680
<v Speaker 1>That dude has been around a long fucking time.</v>

1026
00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:23.420
<v Speaker 1>Nate and I flatten 99.</v>

1027
00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.553
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1028
00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:25.670
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

1029
00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Named Mark Hart,</v>

1030
00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:28.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1031
00:28:28.431 --> 00:28:28.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1032
00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:32.720
<v Speaker 1>Brendan Schaub said he's never seen Nate lose a single round in the gym.</v>

1033
00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:33.891
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>

1034
00:28:33.891 --> 00:28:37.700
<v Speaker 1>one of the things he said about Nate is that Nate is probably one of those guys</v>

1035
00:28:37.701 --> 00:28:38.930
<v Speaker 1>that left too much in a jam.</v>

1036
00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:44.260
<v Speaker 1>Just had way too many Jim Morris with Shane car when he used to spar with Shane</v>

1037
00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:45.470
<v Speaker 1>fucking Carwyn,</v>

1038
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:46.580
<v Speaker 1>which is like what?</v>

1039
00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:48.110
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize how big he was.</v>

1040
00:28:48.111 --> 00:28:49.550
<v Speaker 1>I saw the Ellis mania thing.</v>

1041
00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh we can't holy shit.</v>

1042
00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:57.620
<v Speaker 1>Well he like this like requiring dirt like well you have one arm tied to his</v>

1043
00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:00.193
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

1044
00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.630
<v Speaker 1>which is even more insane.</v>

1045
00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.750
<v Speaker 1>They will start taping arm to his body and yes,</v>

1046
00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:05.301
<v Speaker 1>two people,</v>

1047
00:29:05.301 --> 00:29:06.890
<v Speaker 1>they had to make gloves wore in the UFC.</v>

1048
00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:07.171
<v Speaker 1>He's he,</v>

1049
00:29:07.171 --> 00:29:07.880
<v Speaker 1>him and Brock.</v>

1050
00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:08.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1051
00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:08.900
<v Speaker 1>His,</v>

1052
00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:10.150
<v Speaker 1>his hands are bigger than Brock's.</v>

1053
00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:11.050
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

1054
00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:11.883
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1055
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:13.370
<v Speaker 1>I remember I was at um,</v>

1056
00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:14.653
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1057
00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:17.930
<v Speaker 1>where the fuck was I?</v>

1058
00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:19.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1059
00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:20.593
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

1060
00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.360
<v Speaker 1>I was at a mall Easton's Jujitsu,</v>

1061
00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:27.890
<v Speaker 1>a school in Boulder and I was on the mat when we were trained and we're doing</v>

1062
00:29:27.891 --> 00:29:29.910
<v Speaker 1>drills and now the corner of my eye,</v>

1063
00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:33.800
<v Speaker 1>see what looks like the thing from the comic book movie.</v>

1064
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:35.090
<v Speaker 1>Fantastic four.</v>

1065
00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:36.380
<v Speaker 1>It looks like the thing,</v>

1066
00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:39.620
<v Speaker 1>like if the thing was a real person walking in and I look up,</v>

1067
00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.180
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is that?</v>

1068
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:43.690
<v Speaker 1>And it's Carwyn in between fights,</v>

1069
00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:43.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1070
00:29:43.951 --> 00:29:47.080
<v Speaker 1>he would get to like 300 plus pounds and uh,</v>

1071
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1072
00:29:47.291 --> 00:29:48.040
<v Speaker 1>cause he was,</v>

1073
00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.120
<v Speaker 1>he was a giant.</v>

1074
00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:49.541
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1075
00:29:49.541 --> 00:29:51.370
<v Speaker 1>he was giant and I saw him walking.</v>

1076
00:29:51.371 --> 00:29:52.120
<v Speaker 1>I just remember going,</v>

1077
00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.290
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck?</v>

1078
00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you,</v>

1079
00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:56.070
<v Speaker 1>what do what I can see.</v>

1080
00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.300
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine what Nate does with that guy.</v>

1081
00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:01.360
<v Speaker 1>I just realized what the thing,</v>

1082
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.530
<v Speaker 1>the thing that was made of rocks.</v>

1083
00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:04.463
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1084
00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:05.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was the size of him.</v>

1085
00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:09.210
<v Speaker 1>He was so fucking big that carbon has that,</v>

1086
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:14.430
<v Speaker 1>that weird power to where he can knock dudes out with like six inch punches.</v>

1087
00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:17.740
<v Speaker 1>Like he knocked out Gonzaga Gonzaga had him hurt.</v>

1088
00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:18.761
<v Speaker 1>And then he,</v>

1089
00:30:18.761 --> 00:30:19.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1090
00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:20.680
<v Speaker 1>as he's wobbling backwards,</v>

1091
00:30:20.681 --> 00:30:25.681
<v Speaker 1>he uncorked a six inch punch that puts Gonzaga in the dark lands,</v>

1092
00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:27.611
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

1093
00:30:27.611 --> 00:30:30.550
<v Speaker 1>It's still weird because think about the fight with him and,</v>

1094
00:30:30.551 --> 00:30:30.821
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1095
00:30:30.821 --> 00:30:31.101
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1096
00:30:31.101 --> 00:30:33.100
<v Speaker 1>and Brock and Canada in Vancouver,</v>

1097
00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.160
<v Speaker 1>and he beat the snot out of Broccoli first round.</v>

1098
00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:37.930
<v Speaker 1>He just didn't conserve himself enough.</v>

1099
00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Any gas,</v>

1100
00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:38.910
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1101
00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:39.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1102
00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:39.940
<v Speaker 1>I remember it.</v>

1103
00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:40.773
<v Speaker 1>Gas Hard,</v>

1104
00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:45.250
<v Speaker 1>trying to put them away first round and Brock isn't a guy that they can take a</v>

1105
00:30:45.251 --> 00:30:47.360
<v Speaker 1>lot of like a punishment like that.</v>

1106
00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:52.300
<v Speaker 1>You don't think he brought that guy but he survived it and turned it back on?</v>

1107
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:53.740
<v Speaker 1>Well somehow or another,</v>

1108
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:55.150
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another he survived it,</v>

1109
00:30:55.151 --> 00:30:59.200
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like to this day that have car would've just stayed calm and just</v>

1110
00:30:59.201 --> 00:30:59.861
<v Speaker 1>kept that fight.</v>

1111
00:30:59.861 --> 00:31:00.910
<v Speaker 1>Standing and striking.</v>

1112
00:31:00.911 --> 00:31:04.420
<v Speaker 1>Brock was fucked because he was a commensurate wrestler.</v>

1113
00:31:04.421 --> 00:31:04.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1114
00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:09.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean he might not have been as good a wrestler in wrestling as Brock is,</v>

1115
00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.980
<v Speaker 1>but in MMA he's right the fuck up.</v>

1116
00:31:11.981 --> 00:31:12.401
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1117
00:31:12.401 --> 00:31:13.600
<v Speaker 1>good luck taking them down,</v>

1118
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:15.940
<v Speaker 1>especially when you've got to get close enough for him to tag you.</v>

1119
00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:20.710
<v Speaker 1>I feel like to this day that if he just stayed calm and just box the fuck out of</v>

1120
00:31:20.711 --> 00:31:21.041
<v Speaker 1>Brock,</v>

1121
00:31:21.041 --> 00:31:23.290
<v Speaker 1>he'd be in the UFC heavyweight champion for sure.</v>

1122
00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:26.080
<v Speaker 1>But he just tried to just end it real quick.</v>

1123
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Which makes sense because when you see,</v>

1124
00:31:28.781 --> 00:31:32.170
<v Speaker 1>when you see Brock run away from some of the shots that he ran away from before</v>

1125
00:31:32.171 --> 00:31:35.170
<v Speaker 1>that and chain hits like he hits.</v>

1126
00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:35.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1127
00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:36.271
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1128
00:31:36.271 --> 00:31:39.460
<v Speaker 1>And just close the show and then he's big.</v>

1129
00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:39.850
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1130
00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:41.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean like he's way bigger than Mark Hun.</v>

1131
00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:42.371
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1132
00:31:42.371 --> 00:31:43.300
<v Speaker 1>he's Mark [inaudible].</v>

1133
00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:44.980
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of the same scenario,</v>

1134
00:31:44.981 --> 00:31:46.150
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't have the wrestling.</v>

1135
00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:47.021
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1136
00:31:47.021 --> 00:31:50.660
<v Speaker 1>Mark Hunt's was nowhere near or near the South Bronx.</v>

1137
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.480
<v Speaker 1>So fucking big.</v>

1138
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:56.320
<v Speaker 1>He's big in a way that even the chain is big in a different way.</v>

1139
00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:57.173
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

1140
00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:57.881
<v Speaker 1>his bizarre,</v>

1141
00:31:57.881 --> 00:31:59.460
<v Speaker 1>Brock's even wider than Shane.</v>

1142
00:31:59.650 --> 00:31:59.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1143
00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:00.280
<v Speaker 1>they built,</v>

1144
00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:00.611
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1145
00:32:00.611 --> 00:32:01.090
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

1146
00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:04.350
<v Speaker 1>when you cut to me to 65 changes.</v>

1147
00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:05.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1148
00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:06.100
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1149
00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:06.933
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

1150
00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:07.901
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1151
00:32:07.901 --> 00:32:09.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're,</v>

1152
00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:12.220
<v Speaker 1>they're still trying to figure out what Brock was,</v>

1153
00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:12.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1154
00:32:12.851 --> 00:32:13.411
<v Speaker 1>like they're,</v>

1155
00:32:13.411 --> 00:32:16.070
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to mount some sort of a defense there.</v>

1156
00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:20.110
<v Speaker 1>They're coming up with like skin cream now they're saying if skin cream made him</v>

1157
00:32:20.111 --> 00:32:20.944
<v Speaker 1>piss hot</v>

1158
00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:24.400
<v Speaker 1>guys are so hilarious.</v>

1159
00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Clomid and fucking skin cream.</v>

1160
00:32:26.981 --> 00:32:27.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened.</v>

1161
00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:28.001
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

1162
00:32:28.001 --> 00:32:33.001
<v Speaker 1>What's funny is there actually was some sort of a hormone peptide in um,</v>

1163
00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:36.160
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

1164
00:32:36.161 --> 00:32:40.370
<v Speaker 1>the skin cream for psoriasis that Chad Mendez use.</v>

1165
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Chad Mendez has some pretty serious psoriasis and there's all these photos of</v>

1166
00:32:43.941 --> 00:32:44.091
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1167
00:32:44.091 --> 00:32:47.540
<v Speaker 1>You could see him ma online whereas weren't shorts and shit and it's just all</v>

1168
00:32:47.541 --> 00:32:48.321
<v Speaker 1>over his legs.</v>

1169
00:32:48.321 --> 00:32:50.450
<v Speaker 1>It's real bad and you have to take,</v>

1170
00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:54.500
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times you're taking what is essentially a steroid cream to try to heal</v>

1171
00:32:54.501 --> 00:32:54.770
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1172
00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:55.603
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1173
00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:56.420
<v Speaker 1>the area.</v>

1174
00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:00.350
<v Speaker 1>And that is what made him test positive when they found the cream,</v>

1175
00:33:00.351 --> 00:33:01.880
<v Speaker 1>they tested the cream and him and Yup,</v>

1176
00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:02.743
<v Speaker 1>sure enough.</v>

1177
00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:03.021
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

1178
00:33:03.021 --> 00:33:05.360
<v Speaker 1>so it's a medication so he has a legitimate,</v>

1179
00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:08.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean he has a real element you see as the services pension.</v>

1180
00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:09.580
<v Speaker 1>You got this as basic.</v>

1181
00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:10.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1182
00:33:10.341 --> 00:33:11.030
<v Speaker 1>I believe so.</v>

1183
00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:11.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1184
00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:12.403
<v Speaker 1>I believe so.</v>

1185
00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.570
<v Speaker 1>Well you saw it as no fucking joke man,</v>

1186
00:33:14.571 --> 00:33:17.450
<v Speaker 1>which is really funny watching all these guys go over to Bell Tor.</v>

1187
00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:19.430
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to be a,</v>

1188
00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:20.510
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be interesting.</v>

1189
00:33:20.511 --> 00:33:22.310
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be interesting to see what Bellah toward does.</v>

1190
00:33:22.311 --> 00:33:25.370
<v Speaker 1>We're like van underlay and all these other guys that are going over there and</v>

1191
00:33:25.371 --> 00:33:26.280
<v Speaker 1>tails for scale.</v>

1192
00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:28.243
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1193
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:29.391
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1194
00:33:29.391 --> 00:33:30.224
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

1195
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.981
<v Speaker 1>We'll chill.</v>

1196
00:33:30.981 --> 00:33:31.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1197
00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.830
<v Speaker 1>they said that Charles said that they're tested them like crazy.</v>

1198
00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:35.030
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1199
00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:35.361
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

1200
00:33:35.361 --> 00:33:37.730
<v Speaker 1>they might be my fucking son of a text message.</v>

1201
00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:38.661
<v Speaker 1>Hey Yo,</v>

1202
00:33:38.661 --> 00:33:40.910
<v Speaker 1>we're testing you like crazy and three days,</v>

1203
00:33:40.911 --> 00:33:41.241
<v Speaker 1>wink,</v>

1204
00:33:41.241 --> 00:33:42.074
<v Speaker 1>wink.</v>

1205
00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:44.140
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

1206
00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Commission.</v>

1207
00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:45.021
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1208
00:33:45.021 --> 00:33:45.854
<v Speaker 1>It's not even,</v>

1209
00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:46.910
<v Speaker 1>it's not a new soda.</v>

1210
00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:47.660
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1211
00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:50.540
<v Speaker 1>no one's doing it the way the UFC is doing it and the way UFC is doing it.</v>

1212
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:50.811
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1213
00:33:50.811 --> 00:33:51.750
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of ways it's,</v>

1214
00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:53.690
<v Speaker 1>it's dangerous to their brand,</v>

1215
00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:54.160
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1216
00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:54.381
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1217
00:33:54.381 --> 00:33:55.320
<v Speaker 1>a lot of ways it's,</v>

1218
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:58.220
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people would say it's not a good idea financially,</v>

1219
00:33:58.221 --> 00:34:00.800
<v Speaker 1>but it just shows their commitment to trying to clean it up.</v>

1220
00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:03.740
<v Speaker 1>California is doing randoms to now,</v>

1221
00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:05.610
<v Speaker 1>just as the Athletic Commission,</v>

1222
00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.000
<v Speaker 1>the Commissioner came here from Georgia and he's,</v>

1223
00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:09.040
<v Speaker 1>he's wrecking down.</v>

1224
00:34:09.041 --> 00:34:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1225
00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:10.483
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

1226
00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:11.581
<v Speaker 1>The problem with the,</v>

1227
00:34:11.581 --> 00:34:12.830
<v Speaker 1>you saw the thing is that it's,</v>

1228
00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:14.000
<v Speaker 1>if your boss,</v>

1229
00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:15.471
<v Speaker 1>the people that pay,</v>

1230
00:34:15.471 --> 00:34:17.210
<v Speaker 1>you saw that the test is the UFC.</v>

1231
00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:17.990
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1232
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:19.700
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a conflict of interest.</v>

1233
00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.070
<v Speaker 1>At some level it should be,</v>

1234
00:34:22.071 --> 00:34:22.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1235
00:34:22.311 --> 00:34:25.190
<v Speaker 1>a state sanctioned or somebody away from both parties,</v>

1236
00:34:25.191 --> 00:34:26.024
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1237
00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:26.980
<v Speaker 1>because who,</v>

1238
00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:27.250
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

1239
00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:27.510
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

1240
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:29.270
<v Speaker 1>who makes the choice on who gets tested?</v>

1241
00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:33.410
<v Speaker 1>Because signing when you told drug tests and the California for example,</v>

1242
00:34:33.890 --> 00:34:37.910
<v Speaker 1>the California Athletic Commission is going to contact Bella tour and say you're</v>

1243
00:34:37.911 --> 00:34:38.240
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>

1244
00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:39.230
<v Speaker 1>This guy is not fighting.</v>

1245
00:34:39.231 --> 00:34:40.064
<v Speaker 1>He failed a drug test.</v>

1246
00:34:40.910 --> 00:34:43.150
<v Speaker 1>When you fell a test of the [inaudible],</v>

1247
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:44.550
<v Speaker 1>they're going to call the UFC McKay.</v>

1248
00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:44.851
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1249
00:34:44.851 --> 00:34:45.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1250
00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:46.730
<v Speaker 1>this guy failed the drug test.</v>

1251
00:34:46.731 --> 00:34:47.780
<v Speaker 1>What do you want to do about it?</v>

1252
00:34:47.781 --> 00:34:48.614
<v Speaker 1>And that's not,</v>

1253
00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:49.700
<v Speaker 1>that becomes a problem.</v>

1254
00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:49.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1255
00:34:49.911 --> 00:34:54.510
<v Speaker 1>This guy is called cocaine in his system and then he fights for,</v>

1256
00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.840
<v Speaker 1>we'll just lose those results till after this main event.</v>

1257
00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:57.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1258
00:34:57.111 --> 00:34:59.150
<v Speaker 1>But that's different because it's at a competition.</v>

1259
00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:00.770
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain rules.</v>

1260
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:00.921
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1261
00:35:00.921 --> 00:35:01.754
<v Speaker 1>what happened to him?</v>

1262
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:02.960
<v Speaker 1>There's certain nuts.</v>

1263
00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.460
<v Speaker 1>I thought he's knee buckled.</v>

1264
00:35:04.461 --> 00:35:06.740
<v Speaker 1>I thought he got hit with a push kick to the leg.</v>

1265
00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:08.120
<v Speaker 1>But I think there's,</v>

1266
00:35:08.121 --> 00:35:08.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1267
00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:12.440
<v Speaker 1>there's out of competition testing and then there's in competition testing and</v>

1268
00:35:12.441 --> 00:35:16.070
<v Speaker 1>when you get tested for something in competition,</v>

1269
00:35:16.071 --> 00:35:20.690
<v Speaker 1>it's very different than at a competition when it comes to recreational drugs.</v>

1270
00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:22.940
<v Speaker 1>But when it comes to performance enhancing drugs,</v>

1271
00:35:22.941 --> 00:35:24.260
<v Speaker 1>like even if it's at a competition,</v>

1272
00:35:24.261 --> 00:35:25.520
<v Speaker 1>like save your five weeks out,</v>

1273
00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:27.440
<v Speaker 1>he tests positive for cocaine.</v>

1274
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:29.720
<v Speaker 1>That's not going to affect your performance in the ring in a,</v>

1275
00:35:29.721 --> 00:35:31.490
<v Speaker 1>in a way that's going to damage your opponent.</v>

1276
00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:34.280
<v Speaker 1>But if you test positive for some sort of steroid,</v>

1277
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:37.190
<v Speaker 1>then it will make sense.</v>

1278
00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:38.550
<v Speaker 1>It kind of makes sense.</v>

1279
00:35:38.551 --> 00:35:39.091
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>

1280
00:35:39.091 --> 00:35:40.560
<v Speaker 1>Until you talked to Nick Diaz,</v>

1281
00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:43.350
<v Speaker 1>well that was the most ridiculous shit that you saw.</v>

1282
00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:43.710
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1283
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:45.470
<v Speaker 1>that was in Nevada state athletic commission.</v>

1284
00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:46.140
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1285
00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:50.820
<v Speaker 1>Not only that you sought and no Wicki were Novitsky is 100% against it.</v>

1286
00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:51.060
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1287
00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:52.410
<v Speaker 1>he thinks it was ridiculous.</v>

1288
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:52.891
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1289
00:35:52.891 --> 00:35:56.250
<v Speaker 3>that same fight and make filled for that of commission.</v>

1290
00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:57.870
<v Speaker 3>It's been an AP for five years.</v>

1291
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:02.700
<v Speaker 3>Anderson failed a drug test for steroids and they had lost his results until</v>

1292
00:36:02.701 --> 00:36:03.534
<v Speaker 3>after the fight.</v>

1293
00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:04.570
<v Speaker 1>Look at this knee buckle.</v>

1294
00:36:04.571 --> 00:36:05.201
<v Speaker 1>Watch this shit.</v>

1295
00:36:05.201 --> 00:36:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Lugging them off.</v>

1296
00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Did you see this?</v>

1297
00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that?</v>

1298
00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.350
<v Speaker 1>I was knee just buckled it.</v>

1299
00:36:08.351 --> 00:36:09.184
<v Speaker 1>That was awful.</v>

1300
00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:10.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1301
00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:11.230
<v Speaker 1>it was horrible.</v>

1302
00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:13.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean Anderson was doing,</v>

1303
00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:13.631
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1304
00:36:13.631 --> 00:36:14.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he was doing,</v>

1305
00:36:14.711 --> 00:36:16.330
<v Speaker 1>but he had steroids in a system.</v>

1306
00:36:16.331 --> 00:36:16.571
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1307
00:36:16.571 --> 00:36:19.300
<v Speaker 1>For whatever reason he said it's from Chinese Cialis.</v>

1308
00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:21.370
<v Speaker 1>It was just hilarious.</v>

1309
00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:23.050
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking,</v>

1310
00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:24.520
<v Speaker 1>I would like to see if someone pub,</v>

1311
00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:28.900
<v Speaker 1>someone's should publish a list of all the excuses fighters have made for</v>

1312
00:36:28.901 --> 00:36:29.551
<v Speaker 1>pissing the high.</v>

1313
00:36:29.551 --> 00:36:30.384
<v Speaker 1>Are they good?</v>

1314
00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:31.253
<v Speaker 1>Make a t shirt.</v>

1315
00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:32.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1316
00:36:32.471 --> 00:36:33.050
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1317
00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:33.970
<v Speaker 1>Like a tour,</v>

1318
00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:36.430
<v Speaker 1>like a world tour tee shirt of the back.</v>

1319
00:36:36.431 --> 00:36:37.780
<v Speaker 1>All the different excuses.</v>

1320
00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:43.620
<v Speaker 3>Sylvia failed for like winstrol or something and he said he was doing it just to</v>

1321
00:36:43.621 --> 00:36:44.161
<v Speaker 3>get to,</v>

1322
00:36:44.161 --> 00:36:47.040
<v Speaker 3>so we have this body would look better because he was getting so much shit about</v>

1323
00:36:47.041 --> 00:36:47.750
<v Speaker 3>looking fat.</v>

1324
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:48.583
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1325
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:52.430
<v Speaker 1>Well the Tim Silvia that knocked out Rico Rodriguez was a monster.</v>

1326
00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:52.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1327
00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:54.320
<v Speaker 1>You going back to that Tim Silvia,</v>

1328
00:36:54.321 --> 00:36:56.810
<v Speaker 1>that Tim Silvia was one of the scariest heavyweights ever.</v>

1329
00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:57.340
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1330
00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:58.670
<v Speaker 1>that was when he got pumped.</v>

1331
00:36:58.850 --> 00:36:59.940
<v Speaker 1>I think that was when he goes,</v>

1332
00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:01.340
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1333
00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:04.700
<v Speaker 1>I remember that fight because I remember he had a hard time making two 65.</v>

1334
00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:07.580
<v Speaker 1>He had a cut weight to make to 65 and he wasn't,</v>

1335
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:09.440
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't fat at all back then.</v>

1336
00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:10.281
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1337
00:37:10.281 --> 00:37:11.114
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

1338
00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.320
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't shredded.</v>

1339
00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:13.940
<v Speaker 1>But for Tim Silvia,</v>

1340
00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:14.211
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1341
00:37:14.211 --> 00:37:18.170
<v Speaker 1>he was real lean watching Tim Silvia walk around.</v>

1342
00:37:18.171 --> 00:37:18.981
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't look like,</v>

1343
00:37:18.981 --> 00:37:20.310
<v Speaker 1>like an athlete isn't it looked like he,</v>

1344
00:37:20.311 --> 00:37:20.480
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

1345
00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.880
<v Speaker 1>he would have ever been in a heavyweight champion of the UFC.</v>

1346
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.980
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

1347
00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:24.740
<v Speaker 1>he had hot,</v>

1348
00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:25.431
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck.</v>

1349
00:37:25.431 --> 00:37:25.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1350
00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:26.181
<v Speaker 1>Well Dude,</v>

1351
00:37:26.181 --> 00:37:28.100
<v Speaker 1>I talked to Kelly start about that.</v>

1352
00:37:28.101 --> 00:37:28.640
<v Speaker 1>Who's,</v>

1353
00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:29.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1354
00:37:29.001 --> 00:37:29.271
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1355
00:37:29.271 --> 00:37:29.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1356
00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:34.720
<v Speaker 1>a real famous strength and conditioning coach and knows a lot about physiology</v>

1357
00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:35.601
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>

1358
00:37:35.601 --> 00:37:36.434
<v Speaker 1>and he thinks that,</v>

1359
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:37.400
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>

1360
00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:38.390
<v Speaker 1>he thinks that,</v>

1361
00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:39.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1362
00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:39.951
<v Speaker 1>Tim Silvia,</v>

1363
00:37:39.951 --> 00:37:42.200
<v Speaker 1>that pigeon toed thing that he did,</v>

1364
00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:43.760
<v Speaker 1>he thinks that's correctable.</v>

1365
00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:44.511
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1366
00:37:44.511 --> 00:37:47.780
<v Speaker 1>you just got to retrain your body how to walk and stand.</v>

1367
00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:49.790
<v Speaker 1>And for some reason he never did that.</v>

1368
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:53.420
<v Speaker 1>But start really believes that like the mechanics of your body,</v>

1369
00:37:53.421 --> 00:37:58.421
<v Speaker 1>like you've kind of been cut into a groove where your body's gotten accustom to</v>

1370
00:37:58.431 --> 00:38:00.140
<v Speaker 1>walking and standing in that way.</v>

1371
00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:02.630
<v Speaker 1>But if you adjusted that and train that,</v>

1372
00:38:02.631 --> 00:38:05.120
<v Speaker 1>he would be a way better athlete and it would move like,</v>

1373
00:38:05.121 --> 00:38:05.301
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1374
00:38:05.301 --> 00:38:07.970
<v Speaker 1>like a Travis brown or something like that was a big tall guy who moves.</v>

1375
00:38:07.971 --> 00:38:08.804
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

1376
00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:09.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1377
00:38:09.291 --> 00:38:10.124
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

1378
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:11.150
<v Speaker 1>as a grown man,</v>

1379
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:13.070
<v Speaker 1>you think he can do retrain.</v>

1380
00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.500
<v Speaker 1>I understand you can do,</v>

1381
00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:16.120
<v Speaker 1>but if he wanted to take takes a lot.</v>

1382
00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:16.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1383
00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:16.851
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1384
00:38:16.851 --> 00:38:17.030
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1385
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.930
<v Speaker 1>I listened to Kelly,</v>

1386
00:38:17.931 --> 00:38:19.610
<v Speaker 1>I think Kelly knows what the fuck he's talking about.</v>

1387
00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:20.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1388
00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:21.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he's right,</v>

1389
00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:22.340
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

1390
00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.470
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine there's something short of them having some scar</v>

1391
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:28.830
<v Speaker 3>tissue or whatever that forces him to walk that way and then you could change</v>

1392
00:38:28.831 --> 00:38:28.981
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1393
00:38:28.981 --> 00:38:31.110
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think it's likely to grown.</v>

1394
00:38:31.111 --> 00:38:32.280
<v Speaker 3>Man has already been successful.</v>

1395
00:38:32.281 --> 00:38:32.631
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna be like,</v>

1396
00:38:32.631 --> 00:38:32.791
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1397
00:38:32.791 --> 00:38:34.050
<v Speaker 3>I wish I could walk a little less,</v>

1398
00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:35.080
<v Speaker 3>less goofy.</v>

1399
00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.010
<v Speaker 3>Let me fix this year.</v>

1400
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:36.431
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1401
00:38:36.431 --> 00:38:36.731
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1402
00:38:36.731 --> 00:38:38.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what makes you walk.</v>

1403
00:38:38.021 --> 00:38:38.890
<v Speaker 2>Pigeon toed.</v>

1404
00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:39.550
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

1405
00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:40.240
<v Speaker 2>pull that up.</v>

1406
00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.060
<v Speaker 2>Tim Silvia goes and fixes walk in next year.</v>

1407
00:38:43.061 --> 00:38:43.871
<v Speaker 2>We see him in the NFL.</v>

1408
00:38:43.871 --> 00:38:44.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1409
00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:45.670
<v Speaker 2>Well I don't know about all that.</v>

1410
00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:47.141
<v Speaker 2>The last thing,</v>

1411
00:38:47.141 --> 00:38:49.420
<v Speaker 2>I think that dude needs to get him to that anymore.</v>

1412
00:38:49.421 --> 00:38:49.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1413
00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:51.010
<v Speaker 2>That ray Mercer fight.</v>

1414
00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:51.550
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1415
00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:52.000
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

1416
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:52.930
<v Speaker 2>that was the end of the wall.</v>

1417
00:38:52.931 --> 00:38:53.380
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

1418
00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:54.320
<v Speaker 2>that was a nice</v>

1419
00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:56.431
<v Speaker 2>kick in there.</v>

1420
00:38:56.431 --> 00:38:57.264
<v Speaker 2>It didn't matter.</v>

1421
00:38:59.660 --> 00:38:59.811
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1422
00:38:59.811 --> 00:39:02.150
<v Speaker 1>we should probably say we're watching round three.</v>

1423
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:07.510
<v Speaker 1>It's 27262520420 two seconds to go in.</v>

1424
00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Does it?</v>

1425
00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:12.200
<v Speaker 1>Explaining what causes it.</v>

1426
00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:16.190
<v Speaker 1>What causes pigeon toe pigeon toes caused by one of three conditions.</v>

1427
00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:17.390
<v Speaker 1>Metasys,</v>

1428
00:39:17.391 --> 00:39:21.830
<v Speaker 1>serous Matar Sus Metta,</v>

1429
00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:23.390
<v Speaker 1>Metta Tarsus,</v>

1430
00:39:23.391 --> 00:39:25.760
<v Speaker 1>metatarsus Adductus,</v>

1431
00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:30.260
<v Speaker 1>tibial torsion or femoral anteversion.</v>

1432
00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:33.410
<v Speaker 1>Each condition is specific to its location.</v>

1433
00:39:33.411 --> 00:39:34.970
<v Speaker 1>Here's a brief description of each.</v>

1434
00:39:34.971 --> 00:39:39.971
<v Speaker 1>The foot pigeon toes occur when the foot tends to resemble a kidney awe.</v>

1435
00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Or when a metatarsus adductus has an inward curve at the outer edge of the foot.</v>

1436
00:39:48.561 --> 00:39:50.540
<v Speaker 1>If your child has this condition,</v>

1437
00:39:50.541 --> 00:39:53.720
<v Speaker 1>you'll probably notice it while your child is still a baby.</v>

1438
00:39:53.721 --> 00:39:57.050
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the doctor will try braces or special shoes while the child is still a</v>

1439
00:39:57.051 --> 00:39:57.884
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>

1440
00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:59.030
<v Speaker 1>Six to nine months old.</v>

1441
00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.700
<v Speaker 1>Help you manipulate the bones into growing straight.</v>

1442
00:40:01.701 --> 00:40:04.610
<v Speaker 1>The condition will not clear up on its own.</v>

1443
00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:08.300
<v Speaker 1>Metatarsus adductus requires treatment.</v>

1444
00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:11.750
<v Speaker 1>The nature of which varies depending upon whether the condition is flexible or</v>

1445
00:40:11.751 --> 00:40:12.500
<v Speaker 1>fixed.</v>

1446
00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:15.080
<v Speaker 1>Most flexible cases respond to conservative treatment,</v>

1447
00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:17.120
<v Speaker 1>which indicates passive stretching,</v>

1448
00:40:17.121 --> 00:40:19.100
<v Speaker 1>bracing and specialized shoes.</v>

1449
00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:22.880
<v Speaker 1>The fixed type requires serial plaster casting.</v>

1450
00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.400
<v Speaker 1>If conservative treatment does not help,</v>

1451
00:40:25.401 --> 00:40:29.870
<v Speaker 1>then reevaluation as in order to make sure the patient does not have true club</v>

1452
00:40:29.871 --> 00:40:31.820
<v Speaker 1>foot instead of metatarsus.</v>

1453
00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:32.713
<v Speaker 1>Adductus.</v>

1454
00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:33.913
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1455
00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:35.413
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

1456
00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:36.560
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1457
00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:37.490
<v Speaker 2>right now I'm just,</v>

1458
00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:38.900
<v Speaker 2>I like looking behind the veil,</v>

1459
00:40:38.901 --> 00:40:39.734
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1460
00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:42.430
<v Speaker 2>There are times when when I'm listening to you about gas and,</v>

1461
00:40:42.431 --> 00:40:42.861

1462
00:40:42.861 --> 00:40:43.694

1465
00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:47.961
<v Speaker 2>what is he doing?</v>

1466
00:40:47.961 --> 00:40:48.890
<v Speaker 2>Where's that coming from?</v>

1467
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:49.130
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1468

<v Speaker 2>now I know.</v>

1469
00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:50.480
<v Speaker 2>Now I know.</v>

1470
00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:51.380
<v Speaker 2>See how it works.</v>

1471
00:40:51.381 --> 00:40:52.214
<v Speaker 2>It's called the Internet.</v>

1472
00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.073
<v Speaker 2>It's like magic.</v>

1473
00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:53.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1474
00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:55.870
<v Speaker 2>but Google is,</v>

1475
00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:57.290
<v Speaker 2>you're asking someone else can do it.</v>

1476
00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:57.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1477
00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.180
<v Speaker 2>how are you asking someone else to do it?</v>

1478
00:40:59.181 --> 00:41:00.050
<v Speaker 2>And then you're reading it.</v>

1479
00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:00.891

<v Speaker 2>He's a wizard.</v>

1490
00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:14.420
<v Speaker 2>That guy is a striking wizard.</v>

1491
00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:16.760
<v Speaker 2>He broke my orbital daddy.</v>

1492

<v Speaker 2>that's not very nice.</v>

1494
00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:20.560
<v Speaker 2>So what did he hit you with?</v>

1495
00:41:20.561 --> 00:41:21.290
<v Speaker 2>A fun.</v>

1496
00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:22.490
<v Speaker 2>I was in his guard.</v>

1497
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:23.211
<v Speaker 2>I'm on top,</v>

1498
00:41:23.211 --> 00:41:25.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean as a guard and he throws a punch.</v>

1499
00:41:25.101 --> 00:41:25.970
<v Speaker 2>He throws it this way.</v>

1500
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000
<v Speaker 2>So he turns his knuckles over and like casting style and all the knuckle hit me</v>

1501
00:41:31.611 --> 00:41:32.690
<v Speaker 2>right in the eyeball.</v>

1502
00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm on top of him and I'm</v>

1503
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:37.460
<v Speaker 5>like throwing shots and then he throws that punch and he hits me and I put my</v>

1504
00:41:37.461 --> 00:41:39.500
<v Speaker 5>head down on his belly and hold on his biceps.</v>

1505
00:41:39.501 --> 00:41:39.741
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>That really hurt.</v>

1508
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:44.120
<v Speaker 5>Like that was one of those moments in a fight.</v>

1509
00:41:44.121 --> 00:41:48.170
<v Speaker 5>Whereas like that hurt and I couldn't see straight for the rest of that was the</v>

1510
00:41:48.171 --> 00:41:50.720
<v Speaker 5>first round from the bottom here on the bottom.</v>

1511
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:51.920
<v Speaker 5>He was losing his guard.</v>

1512
00:41:51.921 --> 00:41:52.521
<v Speaker 5>Close guard.</v>

1513
00:41:52.521 --> 00:41:52.880
<v Speaker 5>He threw it.</v>

1514
00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:53.970
<v Speaker 5>That punch hit me right now.</v>

1515
00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:54.980
<v Speaker 5>Eyeball since that</v>

<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1519
00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:01.040
<v Speaker 5>two things happen.</v>

1520
00:42:01.041 --> 00:42:04.760
<v Speaker 5>Either the eyeball ruptures or you're fracturing to relieve the pressure.</v>

1521
00:42:04.761 --> 00:42:05.594
<v Speaker 5>So I got lucky,</v>

1522
00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:07.130
<v Speaker 5>my brother in law,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Oh that's fucked.</v>

1531
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:16.783
<v Speaker 5>You see that?</v>

1532

1546
00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:46.250
<v Speaker 5>We might be able to keep the eye with like filling in cause it opened in the</v>

1547
00:42:46.251 --> 00:42:50.030
<v Speaker 5>back like a flap and like all the shit leaked out and then they had to fill it</v>

1548
00:42:50.031 --> 00:42:52.880
<v Speaker 5>with this oil and they're trying to hope that they can at least save the eye.</v>

1549
00:42:52.881 --> 00:42:53.780
<v Speaker 5>But the Vision's gone.</v>

1550
00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:55.003
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>

1551
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:56.150
<v Speaker 5>awful.</v>

1552
00:42:56.150 --> 00:43:00.050
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ and like for like basketball for fun,</v>

1553
00:43:00.051 --> 00:43:01.130
<v Speaker 5>like a fun game.</v>

1554
00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:01.971
<v Speaker 5>I'm a fucking,</v>

1555
00:43:01.971 --> 00:43:03.260
<v Speaker 5>Sunday is terrible.</v>

1556
00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.010
<v Speaker 5>Terrible.</v>

1557
00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:04.610
<v Speaker 5>Yeah man.</v>

1558
00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:05.443
<v Speaker 5>Fuck that.</v>

1559
00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:08.270
<v Speaker 5>Fuck that kick to you.</v>

1560
00:43:08.271 --> 00:43:10.870
<v Speaker 5>Don't like that kick to kick to the thigh.</v>

1561
00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:11.271
<v Speaker 5>It's cool.</v>

1562
00:43:11.271 --> 00:43:13.820
<v Speaker 5>But when you're trying to extend the guy's knee like that,</v>

1563
00:43:13.821 --> 00:43:16.790
<v Speaker 5>I think it's shit illegal in glory and well,</v>

1564
00:43:16.791 --> 00:43:18.650
<v Speaker 5>I mean it really depends on where he's hitting him.</v>

1565
00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:19.360
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1566
00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:22.130
<v Speaker 5>it's such a weird thing because if your leg is,</v>

1567
00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:26.600
<v Speaker 5>if you know your leg is slightly bent and the guy catches you above the thigh</v>

1568
00:43:26.601 --> 00:43:27.440
<v Speaker 5>with that push kick,</v>

1569
00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:30.350
<v Speaker 5>it's going to extend your leg and it's going to hurt.</v>

1570
00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:32.443
<v Speaker 5>There's not,</v>

1571
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:33.930
<v Speaker 5>I mean the way he did it,</v>

1572
00:43:33.931 --> 00:43:34.930
<v Speaker 5>that was really nasty.</v>

1573
00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:36.710
<v Speaker 5>I mean that was one of the worst ones I've seen.</v>

1574
00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:40.370
<v Speaker 5>Did you ever see that one with Miguel Torres who I sit and when I,</v>

1575
00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:42.260
<v Speaker 5>for the first time I was on your podcast,</v>

1576
00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:43.510
<v Speaker 5>it was awful.</v>

1577
00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:46.490
<v Speaker 5>But that every time I see it as bugs me,</v>

1578
00:43:46.491 --> 00:43:49.400
<v Speaker 5>I had a knee surgery and we were talking earlier about how long it takes you to</v>

1579
00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:51.410
<v Speaker 5>come back mentally forever.</v>

1580
00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:55.340
<v Speaker 5>And I was out for a year from an ACL and MCL tear.</v>

1581
00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:58.280
<v Speaker 5>But like in that last three months,</v>

1582
00:43:58.281 --> 00:43:59.390
<v Speaker 5>especially that last camp,</v>

1583
00:43:59.391 --> 00:44:00.560
<v Speaker 5>getting back into the ring,</v>

1584
00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:05.120
<v Speaker 5>like every time you feel like any kind of twist or pop or any scar tissue that</v>

1585
00:44:05.121 --> 00:44:05.511
<v Speaker 5>breaks,</v>

1586
00:44:05.511 --> 00:44:08.120
<v Speaker 5>like you just freak out and you make like a girly noise.</v>

1587
00:44:08.121 --> 00:44:08.720
<v Speaker 5>Like ever.</v>

1588
00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:09.740
<v Speaker 5>I was a fucking spider.</v>

1589
00:44:09.741 --> 00:44:11.750
<v Speaker 5>Ran Across the room and uh,</v>

1590
00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:11.961
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1591
00:44:11.961 --> 00:44:12.770
<v Speaker 5>it was really hard.</v>

1592
00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:15.170
<v Speaker 5>So every time I see any kind of shit like that on the knee,</v>

1593
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.830
<v Speaker 5>it bugs me.</v>

1594
00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:16.011
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1595
00:44:16.011 --> 00:44:18.600
<v Speaker 5>That's why people are so terrified of heel hooks,</v>

1596
00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:19.310
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1597
00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:19.801
<v Speaker 5>he'll hook,</v>

1598
00:44:19.801 --> 00:44:21.980
<v Speaker 5>scare people more than anything because with,</v>

1599
00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:26.900
<v Speaker 5>with the difference between tapping and not tapping quick enough is you being</v>

1600
00:44:26.901 --> 00:44:27.740
<v Speaker 5>crippled for a year</v>

1601
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:30.103
<v Speaker 5>and yeah,</v>

1602
00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:31.213
<v Speaker 5>super effective.</v>

1603
00:44:31.590 --> 00:44:34.770
<v Speaker 5>But that's why a guy like who smaller Paul Horace is so hated,</v>

1604
00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:35.870
<v Speaker 5>like he's the one,</v>

1605
00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:39.090
<v Speaker 5>one of the most hated guys and the history of the sport because he holds on the</v>

1606
00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:39.953
<v Speaker 5>heel hooks.</v>

1607
00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:40.801
<v Speaker 5>Those are,</v>

1608
00:44:40.801 --> 00:44:41.640
<v Speaker 5>those are the two.</v>

1609
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:43.080
<v Speaker 5>Those are the two guys that I hate.</v>

1610
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:43.950
<v Speaker 5>This shit.</v>

1611
00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:45.810
<v Speaker 5>The flashy dancers and the heel hooker.</v>

1612
00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:47.270
<v Speaker 5>This shit is going to be crazy.</v>

1613
00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:49.200
<v Speaker 5>He Kovar Hoeven and bought her heart.</v>

1614
00:44:49.201 --> 00:44:50.180
<v Speaker 5>You seem bottled lately.</v>

1615
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:51.000
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

1616
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.720
<v Speaker 5>It looks like he's on all the steroids for sure.</v>

1617
00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:55.600
<v Speaker 5>All the start for sure.</v>

1619
00:44:57.781 --> 00:44:58.614
<v Speaker 5>For sure.</v>

1620
00:44:58.650 --> 00:44:59.483
<v Speaker 5>He's so much</v>

1621
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:02.290
<v Speaker 5>more.</v>

1622
00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:02.910
<v Speaker 5>I want to watch.</v>

1623
00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:03.120

1625
00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:04.860

<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

1629
00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:10.980
<v Speaker 5>He looks like he gained 1520 pounds of muscle.</v>

1630
00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:12.510
<v Speaker 5>I mean you look at like his last fight.</v>

1631
00:45:12.511 --> 00:45:14.190
<v Speaker 5>He did not look like that at all.</v>

1632
00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:14.730

1638
00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:27.961
<v Speaker 5>Look at this.</v>

1639
00:45:27.961 --> 00:45:29.790
<v Speaker 5>When he was fighting with Shin Protection and head gear,</v>

1640
00:45:29.791 --> 00:45:30.990
<v Speaker 5>I was already a household name,</v>

1641
00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:32.340

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:45.630
<v Speaker 5>He's something special.</v>

<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1709
00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:17.601

00:47:17.601 --> 00:47:18.000
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1711
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.500
<v Speaker 5>it's three events or two events.</v>

1712
00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:22.210
<v Speaker 5>Is it going to be belted toward kickboxing or is it Bella?</v>

1713

<v Speaker 3>18.</v>

1788
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:13.061
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1789
00:49:13.061 --> 00:49:13.421
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>

1790
00:49:13.421 --> 00:49:14.710
<v Speaker 3>if you're 23 years old,</v>

1791
00:49:14.711 --> 00:49:16.030
<v Speaker 3>you're like over the hill,</v>

1792
00:49:16.031 --> 00:49:17.110
<v Speaker 3>like you're fucking getting older.</v>

1793
00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:21.370

<v Speaker 3>maybe Sanchez still is,</v>

1795
00:49:23.351 --> 00:49:27.430
<v Speaker 3>but for the most part those guys that like sand shy or blue collar,</v>

1796
00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:27.761
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

1797
00:49:27.761 --> 00:49:30.430
<v Speaker 3>those guys aren't even like the prime in Thailand anymore.</v>

1798
00:49:30.431 --> 00:49:33.880
<v Speaker 3>They're gotten so old and so big and now they fight the forerunners everywhere.</v>

1799
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:39.520
<v Speaker 3>That's what you were saying like top level and Thailand has like 113 pounds.</v>

00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:41.170
<v Speaker 3>16 powered</v>

1801
00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:44.560
<v Speaker 3>one 34 wins.</v>

1802
00:49:44.561 --> 00:49:46.150
<v Speaker 3>32 losses,</v>

1803
00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:51.100
<v Speaker 3>zero draws with 45 K I was dye is incredible at 20 years old.</v>

1804
00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:54.010
<v Speaker 3>I have a lot of fights that he has as many Kaos is,</v>

1806
00:49:56.050 --> 00:49:58.720

1807
00:49:58.721 --> 00:50:01.480
<v Speaker 3>He's 20 that's crazy.</v>

1808
00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:06.760
<v Speaker 3>That means he was born in 1996 that's insane.</v>

1809
00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:08.410
<v Speaker 3>So when he was born,</v>

1810
00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:09.491
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1811
00:50:09.491 --> 00:50:13.540
<v Speaker 3>but I'm assuming it was when he was like probably like eight years old or five</v>

1812
00:50:13.541 --> 00:50:14.350
<v Speaker 3>years old.</v>

1814
00:50:15.411 --> 00:50:18.820

1815
00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:22.120
<v Speaker 3>raised him and sent him to school or whatnot.</v>

1816
00:50:22.121 --> 00:50:23.200
<v Speaker 3>And then every day after school,</v>

1817
00:50:23.201 --> 00:50:24.550
<v Speaker 3>since he was like five years old,</v>

1826
00:50:34.601 --> 00:50:35.960
<v Speaker 5>that's a big step up for him.</v>

1827
00:50:35.961 --> 00:50:36.794
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1828
00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:37.430

1829
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:38.810
<v Speaker 5>he got the size advantage for sure.</v>

1830
00:50:38.811 --> 00:50:39.291
<v Speaker 5>And this one.</v>

1831
00:50:39.291 --> 00:50:40.011
<v Speaker 5>And then he also,</v>

1832
00:50:40.011 --> 00:50:40.490
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1833
00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:42.800
<v Speaker 5>usually those ties when they come over and they do,</v>

1834
00:50:42.830 --> 00:50:45.920
<v Speaker 5>or when they switch over to kickboxing there first time they don't do that well</v>

1835
00:50:45.921 --> 00:50:47.000
<v Speaker 5>because it's so different.</v>

00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:48.890
<v Speaker 5>This live rule set and stuff.</v>

1837
00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:53.810
<v Speaker 5>How good are the tie fighters when they started getting bigger and heavier</v>

2017
00:55:13.871 --> 00:55:17.560
<v Speaker 2>you guys getting beaten on his feet and your teammates getting beaten on his</v>

2018
00:55:17.561 --> 00:55:17.771
<v Speaker 2>feet,</v>

2019
00:55:17.771 --> 00:55:18.041
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

2020
00:55:18.041 --> 00:55:18.970
<v Speaker 2>you have to take down you.</v>

2021
00:55:18.971 --> 00:55:20.590
<v Speaker 2>You figure like there's another way.</v>

2022
00:55:20.591 --> 00:55:22.810
<v Speaker 2>When you guys getting beat up on their feet and Muay Thai,</v>

2023
00:55:22.811 --> 00:55:23.111
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>

2024
00:55:23.111 --> 00:55:23.940
<v Speaker 2>what are you thinking?</v>

2025
00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:24.773
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2026
00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:26.150
<v Speaker 5>cause there's no other way.</v>

2027
00:55:26.151 --> 00:55:26.361
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2028
00:55:26.361 --> 00:55:26.860
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>

2029
00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:28.700
<v Speaker 5>we've got a big shot.</v>

2030
00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:29.800
<v Speaker 5>We've got to change something here.</v>

2031
00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:30.230
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2032
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:31.790
<v Speaker 5>I like to see Casey start musing.</v>

2033
00:55:31.791 --> 00:55:32.810
<v Speaker 5>This movement stopped being,</v>

2034
00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:34.670
<v Speaker 5>don't be so predictable for that.</v>

2035
00:55:35.090 --> 00:55:35.901
<v Speaker 5>Stand in front of you.</v>

2036
00:55:35.901 --> 00:55:36.734
<v Speaker 5>Thai style.</v>

2037
00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:37.603
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2038
00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:40.670
<v Speaker 5>Well there's also sees chart needs to be like more American right now.</v>

2039
00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:42.530
<v Speaker 5>Not trying to fight him and wait Thai style.</v>

2040
00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:44.990
<v Speaker 5>I guess this guy because it's just too much experience.</v>

2041
00:55:44.991 --> 00:55:49.970
<v Speaker 5>Do you think that guys automatically s try to fight the style of the ties?</v>

2042
00:55:49.971 --> 00:55:50.804
<v Speaker 5>Because,</v>

2043
00:55:50.830 --> 00:55:51.081
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2044
00:55:51.081 --> 00:55:52.370
<v Speaker 5>that's what they idolize,</v>

2045
00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:52.731
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2046
00:55:52.731 --> 00:55:54.760
<v Speaker 5>I mean like everybody who's a Moy Thai fighter,</v>

2047
00:55:54.770 --> 00:55:55.040
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2048
00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:55.400
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2049
00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:56.870
<v Speaker 5>they idolize the greats.</v>

2050
00:55:56.871 --> 00:55:57.111
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2051
00:55:57.111 --> 00:56:02.111
<v Speaker 5>they idolize these high level guys and then they wind up fighting on Monday.</v>

2052
00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:04.721
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2053
00:56:04.721 --> 00:56:06.490
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's intentional per se,</v>

2054
00:56:06.491 --> 00:56:07.630
<v Speaker 5>but I think you ended up doing that.</v>

2055
00:56:07.631 --> 00:56:08.880
<v Speaker 5>Or um,</v>

2056
00:56:09.790 --> 00:56:12.490
<v Speaker 5>we should just watch a bunch of Ramon Dekkers fights.</v>

2057
00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:14.063
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>

2058
00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:17.150
<v Speaker 2>What's going on sir?</v>

2059
00:56:17.151 --> 00:56:17.840
<v Speaker 2>Cut.</v>

2060
00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:18.170
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2061
00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:19.520
<v Speaker 2>Casey was complaining about it,</v>

2062
00:56:19.610 --> 00:56:23.560
<v Speaker 2>about clenching and kneeing the time and the referee stopped it,</v>

2063
00:56:23.561 --> 00:56:24.010
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't</v>

2064
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:24.400
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>

2065
00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:25.360
<v Speaker 1>The Thai guy didn't stop.</v>

2066
00:56:25.810 --> 00:56:26.643
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2067
00:56:27.370 --> 00:56:28.460
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't know what the fuck is.</v>

2068
00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:29.323
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2069
00:56:31.230 --> 00:56:32.390
<v Speaker 1>he's here in bar.</v>

2070
00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:35.873
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2071
00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:37.073

2074
00:56:39.930 --> 00:56:40.131
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2075
00:56:40.131 --> 00:56:40.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2076
00:56:40.301 --> 00:56:41.134
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2077
00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Let me keep fight.</v>

2078
00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:44.530
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a boy.</v>

2079
00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:47.570
<v Speaker 5>You were asking do I think it's kind of like the Wonderboy thing too.</v>

2080
00:56:47.571 --> 00:56:48.404
<v Speaker 5>Like when you,</v>

2081
00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:49.550
<v Speaker 5>when you're in that moment,</v>

2082
00:56:49.551 --> 00:56:50.690
<v Speaker 5>you don't realize that you're,</v>

2083
00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:53.180
<v Speaker 5>you're kind of playing the other guy's game sometime.</v>

2084
00:56:53.181 --> 00:56:53.920
<v Speaker 5>Chin.</v>

2085
00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:54.753
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2086
00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:56.273
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2087
00:56:56.350 --> 00:57:00.690
<v Speaker 1>There's a thing that you see with guys like sit song peanuts.</v>

2088
00:57:00.970 --> 00:57:02.830
<v Speaker 1>When you see guys that have been doing it,</v>

2089
00:57:02.831 --> 00:57:04.090
<v Speaker 1>their whole live with it,</v>

2090
00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:04.390
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

2091
00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:05.980
<v Speaker 1>their triggers so fast.</v>

2092
00:57:05.981 --> 00:57:07.180
<v Speaker 1>Like the way he throws that,</v>

2093
00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:10.500
<v Speaker 1>that kick that let's switch kick through just through and the way he throws.</v>

2094
00:57:10.570 --> 00:57:12.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like they have,</v>

2095
00:57:12.310 --> 00:57:17.310
<v Speaker 1>they have such fluidity because their technique is so a part of like who they</v>

2096
00:57:17.381 --> 00:57:20.140
<v Speaker 1>are and how they develop as a human like yeah,</v>

2097
00:57:20.141 --> 00:57:21.910
<v Speaker 1>just throw that right kick to the arms.</v>

2098
00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:22.871
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2099
00:57:22.871 --> 00:57:26.710
<v Speaker 1>it becomes like a part of how they move.</v>

2100
00:57:26.770 --> 00:57:28.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's probably been moving,</v>

2101
00:57:28.301 --> 00:57:31.570
<v Speaker 1>throwing kicks and punches and avoiding them and and clenching.</v>

2102
00:57:31.571 --> 00:57:32.201
<v Speaker 1>He just did it again.</v>

2103
00:57:32.201 --> 00:57:33.820
<v Speaker 1>He just clinched him and hit him in the knee there.</v>

2104
00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:35.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's been doing that since he was a baby.</v>

2105
00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:37.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2106
00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:38.170
<v Speaker 1>It's just the,</v>

2107
00:57:38.170 --> 00:57:39.120
<v Speaker 1>that I that fight,</v>

2108
00:57:39.490 --> 00:57:44.490
<v Speaker 1>it's just so much to fight Iq and also the efficiency of the movement.</v>

2109
00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:49.660
<v Speaker 1>You Watch Casey and I seen some of his other fights and he fights,</v>

2110
00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:51.640
<v Speaker 1>usually fights at a much longer range.</v>

2111
00:57:51.641 --> 00:57:53.410
<v Speaker 1>He's like really close to this dude.</v>

2112
00:57:56.070 --> 00:57:57.510
<v Speaker 1>He's so punished already.</v>

2113
00:57:57.630 --> 00:57:57.901
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2114
00:57:57.901 --> 00:58:00.360
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the problem with deep into the second round,</v>

2115
00:58:00.361 --> 00:58:02.280
<v Speaker 1>he's just been beaten up so much.</v>

2116
00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:05.120
<v Speaker 5>And the last thing you want to do with the tie with that much experience as the</v>

2117
00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:07.740
<v Speaker 5>clenches and Gloria Roosevelt's was a clinch anyway,</v>

2118
00:58:07.741 --> 00:58:10.290
<v Speaker 5>but like that's what you ends up happening.</v>

2119
00:58:10.291 --> 00:58:10.710
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2120
00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:12.660
<v Speaker 5>for some reason you keep doing the same thing.</v>

2121
00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:13.441
<v Speaker 5>But yeah.</v>

2122
00:58:13.441 --> 00:58:16.860
<v Speaker 5>Casey usually has a really a lot better movement and I'm moving side to side,</v>

2123
00:58:16.861 --> 00:58:20.160
<v Speaker 5>but I think he's getting flustered here or maybe he's looking for the big shot.</v>

2124
00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:21.613
<v Speaker 1>It's not coming.</v>

2125
00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Get aggressive with,</v>

2126
00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:27.290
<v Speaker 1>did he hurt his knee?</v>

2127
00:58:27.290 --> 00:58:28.070
<v Speaker 1>Fuck was that,</v>

2128
00:58:28.070 --> 00:58:29.090
<v Speaker 1>did he hurt his knee there?</v>

2129
00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:31.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure Simon Mind,</v>

2130
00:58:31.801 --> 00:58:33.290
<v Speaker 1>like his leg just gave out.</v>

2131
00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:34.970
<v Speaker 1>He's still wobbly.</v>

2132
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:37.281
<v Speaker 1>What does that from,</v>

2133
00:58:37.281 --> 00:58:38.990
<v Speaker 1>was that from a punch and then see it?</v>

2134
00:58:39.050 --> 00:58:39.171
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2135
00:58:39.171 --> 00:58:39.890
<v Speaker 1>he's fucked.</v>

2136
00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:41.720
<v Speaker 1>He's still fuck Bullock he's trying to move.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2138
00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:42.933

00:58:43.370 --> 00:58:44.210

2141
00:58:46.590 --> 00:58:46.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2142

2147
00:58:50.211 --> 00:58:51.650
<v Speaker 1>it seems like he's not just fun.</v>

2148
00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:52.553
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:06.103
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

2163
00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:06.721
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

2164
00:59:06.721 --> 00:59:07.890
<v Speaker 1>He's too tough for his own good.</v>

2165
00:59:07.891 --> 00:59:09.120
<v Speaker 1>He's got 10 seconds left around.</v>

2166
00:59:09.150 --> 00:59:10.080
<v Speaker 1>The referee stopped the fight.</v>

2167
00:59:10.110 --> 00:59:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

2168
00:59:11.041 --> 00:59:12.470
<v Speaker 1>Right before he got k owed.</v>

2169
00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>

2170
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:18.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2171
00:59:18.211 --> 00:59:18.931
<v Speaker 1>When a guy,</v>

2172
00:59:18.931 --> 00:59:23.570
<v Speaker 1>is that hindered by something you've got to kind of stop the fight.</v>

2173
00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:25.220
<v Speaker 1>What happened with his leg?</v>

2174
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:27.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they're going to show us,</v>

2175
00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:30.740
<v Speaker 1>but that was one of the weirdest way he went down.</v>

2176
00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:31.161
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2177
00:59:31.161 --> 00:59:34.460
<v Speaker 1>and also the way like he was trying to get up and it would just wasn't working.</v>

2178
00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:38.420
<v Speaker 1>It was like his ACL at blown out or something.</v>

2179
00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:39.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you,</v>

2180
00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:39.561
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

2181
00:59:39.561 --> 00:59:42.410
<v Speaker 1>when you just kind of tease the cockroach or bug spray</v>

2182
00:59:43.210 --> 00:59:44.043
<v Speaker 7>black.</v>

2183
00:59:46.790 --> 00:59:47.890

2189
00:59:58.730 --> 00:59:59.091
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2190
00:59:59.091 --> 01:00:00.260
<v Speaker 1>You hit him on the right hand.</v>

2191
01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:04.543
<v Speaker 1>Is that it?</v>

2192
01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:07.523
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

2193
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:08.503
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>

2194
01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:09.360
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

2196
01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:10.220
<v Speaker 1>I was a left hook.</v>

2197
01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:10.431
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2198
01:00:10.431 --> 01:00:10.910
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

2199
01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:12.320
<v Speaker 1>that's the left hook is the end.</v>

2200
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:13.100
<v Speaker 1>Well what,</v>

2201
01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:14.900
<v Speaker 1>what made him wobble like that?</v>

2202
01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:15.291
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2203
01:00:15.291 --> 01:00:16.940
<v Speaker 1>that's the very end of the fight.</v>

2204
01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:18.290
<v Speaker 1>He was already hurt,</v>

2205
01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:21.020
<v Speaker 1>but he already had a problem with his leg was great.</v>

2206
01:00:21.021 --> 01:00:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Camera.</v>

2207
01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:23.030
<v Speaker 1>I want to know this is terrible.</v>

2208
01:00:23.031 --> 01:00:23.864
<v Speaker 1>Replace.</v>

2209
01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:24.351
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

2210
01:00:24.351 --> 01:00:25.850
<v Speaker 1>if I would be asking the truck,</v>

2211
01:00:25.851 --> 01:00:26.930
<v Speaker 1>I want to know what happened.</v>

2212
01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:27.590
<v Speaker 1>Did he,</v>

2213
01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:28.550
<v Speaker 1>was it a punch?</v>

2214
01:00:28.551 --> 01:00:30.170
<v Speaker 1>Was it an elbow?</v>

2215
01:00:30.290 --> 01:00:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Like what caused him to go down the first time and why was he so wobbly?</v>

2216
01:00:34.850 --> 01:00:38.090
<v Speaker 1>Was it because he got hurt or was it because of a knee injury?</v>

2217
01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:40.371
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

2218
01:00:40.371 --> 01:00:41.360
<v Speaker 1>why don't they show that?</v>

2231
01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:58.550

<v Speaker 1>That's a better fight or a really good fight.</v>

2277
01:02:18.951 --> 01:02:20.160
<v Speaker 1>At least it's a really good fight.</v>

2278
01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:20.821
<v Speaker 5>And then the,</v>

2279
01:02:20.821 --> 01:02:21.510
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2280
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:24.690
<v Speaker 5>my buddy wrote me a is fighting on that card as well.</v>

2281
01:02:24.850 --> 01:02:28.590
<v Speaker 5>Who's modeling lion fight has some outstanding talent.</v>

2282
01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:29.520
<v Speaker 5>They really do.</v>

2283
01:02:29.610 --> 01:02:29.731
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2284
01:02:29.731 --> 01:02:33.180
<v Speaker 5>There's a California and in the u s in general,</v>

2285
01:02:33.181 --> 01:02:33.721
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of,</v>

2286
01:02:33.721 --> 01:02:34.554
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2287
01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:38.550
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of really good Manito more so probably than kickboxing because,</v>

2288
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:41.010
<v Speaker 5>cause there's so many Moitai gyms here in Los Angeles.</v>

2289
01:02:41.370 --> 01:02:41.880
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2290
01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:42.541
<v Speaker 5>makes sense.</v>

2291
01:02:42.541 --> 01:02:45.720
<v Speaker 5>It just seems to me it'd be like the most underappreciated,</v>

2292
01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:48.990
<v Speaker 5>underrated sport in the u s especially like,</v>

2293
01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:51.450
<v Speaker 5>what is the one thing that people complain about an MMA like,</v>

2294
01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:53.120
<v Speaker 5>oh fuck and go to the grown.</v>

2295
01:02:53.130 --> 01:02:54.690
<v Speaker 5>You're queer and stop hugging each other.</v>

2296
01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:57.150
<v Speaker 5>No one goes to the ground.</v>

2297
01:02:57.210 --> 01:02:58.200
<v Speaker 5>This is all stand up.</v>

2298
01:02:58.201 --> 01:02:59.040
<v Speaker 5>And yet still,</v>

2299
01:02:59.490 --> 01:03:01.090
<v Speaker 5>I think Moyie Thai also,</v>

2300
01:03:01.091 --> 01:03:02.510
<v Speaker 5>it was much more entertaining.</v>

2301
01:03:02.570 --> 01:03:03.150
<v Speaker 5>Inboxing,</v>

2302
01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:03.983
<v Speaker 5>straight boxing.</v>

2303
01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:04.951
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

2304
01:03:04.951 --> 01:03:05.610
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

2305
01:03:05.610 --> 01:03:07.140
<v Speaker 5>And I think boxing's entertaining.</v>

2306
01:03:07.170 --> 01:03:07.950
<v Speaker 5>Don't get me wrong,</v>

2307
01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:08.760
<v Speaker 5>the greed,</v>

2308
01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:09.660
<v Speaker 5>I still enjoy it.</v>

2309
01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:10.680
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

2310
01:03:10.681 --> 01:03:11.514
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2311
01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:14.370
<v Speaker 5>so the talent's there and the people to watch it or here.</v>

2312
01:03:14.371 --> 01:03:15.780
<v Speaker 5>So where's the problem lies?</v>

2313
01:03:16.550 --> 01:03:17.670
<v Speaker 5>They're going to show it to us.</v>

2314
01:03:17.671 --> 01:03:19.050
<v Speaker 5>Show us the fucking replay.</v>

2315
01:03:19.410 --> 01:03:19.711
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2316
01:03:19.711 --> 01:03:19.921
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2317
01:03:19.921 --> 01:03:21.030
<v Speaker 5>that's a part of the problem.</v>

2318
01:03:21.070 --> 01:03:25.830
<v Speaker 5>They call them Joseph Joe Schilling is that you get these Thai guys beating up</v>

2319
01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:26.641
<v Speaker 5>Americans.</v>

2320
01:03:26.641 --> 01:03:27.030
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2321
01:03:27.030 --> 01:03:27.840
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2322
01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:29.310
<v Speaker 5>this is world class kickboxing.</v>

2323
01:03:29.311 --> 01:03:31.190
<v Speaker 5>So we're going to make a match up with there.</v>

2324
01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:34.320
<v Speaker 5>One of our American up going American stars and we're going to match them up</v>

2325
01:03:34.321 --> 01:03:36.620
<v Speaker 5>with a guy with 160 fights there.</v>

2326
01:03:37.690 --> 01:03:39.030
<v Speaker 5>Kind of fucking interesting,</v>

2327
01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:40.290
<v Speaker 5>interesting.</v>

2328
01:03:40.290 --> 01:03:41.190
<v Speaker 5>Let's see it again.</v>

2329
01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:43.680
<v Speaker 5>So there is a right hand.</v>

2330
01:03:44.170 --> 01:03:45.003
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

2331
01:03:45.490 --> 01:03:46.570

2332
01:03:46.571 --> 01:03:48.460
<v Speaker 5>The what's short circuited in them?</v>

2333
01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:52.090
<v Speaker 8>Hmm.</v>

2334
01:03:52.090 --> 01:03:52.960
<v Speaker 5>And this is what the end,</v>

2335
01:03:52.961 --> 01:03:53.321
<v Speaker 5>the end.</v>

2336
01:03:53.321 --> 01:03:53.861

01:03:54.570 --> 01:03:58.210
<v Speaker 5>the referee should have fucking called did that guy's behind him waving it off.</v>

2340
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:59.800
<v Speaker 5>Who's the guy waving it off?</v>

2341
01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:01.680
<v Speaker 5>He was like an official.</v>

2342
01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:04.603
<v Speaker 8>Hmm.</v>

2343
01:04:05.570 --> 01:04:06.403
<v Speaker 5>Incredible.</v>

<v Speaker 5>who makes that match up?</v>

2347
01:04:09.650 --> 01:04:10.490
<v Speaker 5>That's a good question.</v>

2348

<v Speaker 5>Why would you make that match up?</v>

2349

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2350
01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:19.200
<v Speaker 5>I mean maybe they just need it to fight pain on 600 hundred,</v>

2351
01:04:19.210 --> 01:04:20.510
<v Speaker 5>260 something.</v>

2352
01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:21.580
<v Speaker 5>Thank,</v>

2353
01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:22.430

2354
01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:26.690
<v Speaker 5>16 times more fights.</v>

2355
01:04:28.170 --> 01:04:29.003
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy,</v>

2356
01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:31.633
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>

2357
01:04:32.530 --> 01:04:32.641
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2358
01:04:32.641 --> 01:04:33.550
<v Speaker 5>he's a bad motherfucker,</v>

2359
01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:34.380
<v Speaker 5>that's for sure.</v>

2360
01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:34.620
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2361
01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:35.940
<v Speaker 5>it just interesting to see.</v>

2362
01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:36.950
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2363
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:37.210
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2364
01:04:37.210 --> 01:04:42.210
<v Speaker 5>I would hate for glory and for kickboxing in general to stay at this level about</v>

2365
01:04:43.261 --> 01:04:44.130
<v Speaker 5>the heart on Casey.</v>

2366
01:04:44.131 --> 01:04:45.120
<v Speaker 5>We're all sitting here saying,</v>

2367
01:04:45.121 --> 01:04:46.470
<v Speaker 5>stop the fight stuff of the fight.</v>

2368
01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:48.380
<v Speaker 5>He ain't going to stop the fight he wanted to.</v>

2369
01:04:48.590 --> 01:04:49.390
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

2370
01:04:49.390 --> 01:04:49.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2371
01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:50.341
<v Speaker 5>you get it knocked me out.</v>

2372
01:04:50.341 --> 01:04:52.110
<v Speaker 5>Account guys are fucking monster.</v>

2373
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:54.390
<v Speaker 5>He didn't even try to take a knee when he couldn't stand up.</v>

2374
01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:54.660
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2375
01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:55.290
<v Speaker 5>he didn't,</v>

2376
01:04:55.290 --> 01:04:55.801
<v Speaker 5>he didn't say,</v>

2377
01:04:55.801 --> 01:04:56.970
<v Speaker 5>let me just take a knee here.</v>

2378
01:04:56.971 --> 01:05:00.380
<v Speaker 5>And is he praying to the Thai king who just died?</v>

2379
01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:01.091
<v Speaker 5>Just died.</v>

2380
01:05:01.091 --> 01:05:01.924
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2381
01:05:02.610 --> 01:05:03.600
<v Speaker 5>So that's really common too.</v>

2382
01:05:03.601 --> 01:05:04.440
<v Speaker 5>Also in Thailand,</v>

2383
01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:05.363
<v Speaker 5>they always,</v>

2384
01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:09.390
<v Speaker 5>there's always usually carried a photo of the king to the ring and whatnot.</v>

2385
01:05:09.870 --> 01:05:11.730
<v Speaker 5>Very loyal to the king over there.</v>

2386
01:05:11.731 --> 01:05:14.160
<v Speaker 5>So when the king passed away here recently,</v>

2387
01:05:14.161 --> 01:05:14.821
<v Speaker 5>it was last week,</v>

2388
01:05:14.821 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 5>I think it's like a really big deal to the</v>

2389
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:20.320
<v Speaker 2>Thai people may hear if Obama died,</v>

2390
01:05:20.321 --> 01:05:21.460
<v Speaker 2>it would be like a big deal,</v>

2391
01:05:21.461 --> 01:05:23.120
<v Speaker 2>but not enough people would be as</v>

2392
01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:26.540
<v Speaker 2>Malaparte.</v>

2393
01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:28.750
<v Speaker 2>It had a picture and he posted something on his,</v>

2394
01:05:28.751 --> 01:05:30.610
<v Speaker 2>on his Instagram about it.</v>

2395
01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:34.330
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know if anybody's standing near with a tribute to Obama,</v>

2396
01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:36.220
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't get any of our presence.</v>

2397
01:05:36.221 --> 01:05:36.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2398
01:05:36.610 --> 01:05:37.780
<v Speaker 2>If Obama got shot,</v>

2399
01:05:37.781 --> 01:05:39.100
<v Speaker 2>maybe a month into office,</v>

2400
01:05:39.101 --> 01:05:39.934
<v Speaker 2>people would be sad.</v>

2401
01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:42.820
<v Speaker 2>But after a month they were already blaming him for the economy,</v>

2402
01:05:43.290 --> 01:05:44.123
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2403
01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:45.460
<v Speaker 2>But after eight years,</v>

2404
01:05:46.350 --> 01:05:46.510
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2405
01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:49.150
<v Speaker 2>he'll probably get shot now they're just going to repeal Obamacare.</v>

2406
01:05:49.210 --> 01:05:52.420
<v Speaker 2>The same type of people that still want to have confederate flags would be</v>

2407
01:05:52.421 --> 01:05:53.254
<v Speaker 2>cheering.</v>

2408
01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:55.000
<v Speaker 2>Those people be so happy.</v>

2409
01:05:56.050 --> 01:06:01.050
<v Speaker 2>I go back to Texas sometimes and literally two miles from my daughter's house on</v>

2410
01:06:01.331 --> 01:06:02.480
<v Speaker 2>a corner on a,</v>

2411
01:06:02.490 --> 01:06:02.801
<v Speaker 2>on a,</v>

2412
01:06:02.801 --> 01:06:04.300
<v Speaker 2>on a highway intersection.</v>

2413
01:06:04.470 --> 01:06:04.990
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

2414
01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:08.890
<v Speaker 2>they just got confederate flags just lined up hanging and they're selling them.</v>

2415
01:06:08.890 --> 01:06:11.230
<v Speaker 2>They just sit in there and their trailers selling confederate flags.</v>

2416
01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:15.340
<v Speaker 2>People driving around with confederate flags flying out of the back of their</v>

2417
01:06:15.341 --> 01:06:15.701
<v Speaker 2>trucks,</v>

2418
01:06:15.701 --> 01:06:16.520
<v Speaker 2>their pickups.</v>

2419
01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:16.860
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2420
01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:17.710
<v Speaker 2>it's a different,</v>

2421
01:06:17.770 --> 01:06:19.920
<v Speaker 2>it's weird coming out here because I grew up with,</v>

2422
01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:21.130
<v Speaker 2>I seen that a lot.</v>

2423
01:06:21.131 --> 01:06:21.351
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

2424
01:06:21.351 --> 01:06:23.470
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't strange to me until I came here,</v>

2425
01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:26.170
<v Speaker 2>lived here for a year and then went back there and saw it.</v>

2426
01:06:26.410 --> 01:06:28.360
<v Speaker 2>So I grew up in Ohio and that was like a thing,</v>

2427
01:06:28.361 --> 01:06:30.880
<v Speaker 2>but it was like not like a racist thing.</v>

2428
01:06:30.881 --> 01:06:33.120
<v Speaker 2>It's like a southern thing and it's like part of history.</v>

2429
01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:36.310
<v Speaker 2>Know what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

2430
01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:36.611
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2431
01:06:36.611 --> 01:06:38.420
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

2432
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:40.110
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2433
01:06:40.110 --> 01:06:41.500
<v Speaker 2>it's like redneck.</v>

2434
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.890
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

2435
01:06:41.890 --> 01:06:42.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2436
01:06:42.161 --> 01:06:42.801
<v Speaker 2>it's not whatever.</v>

2437
01:06:42.801 --> 01:06:44.540
<v Speaker 2>And I'm really in a grits chip,</v>

2438
01:06:44.590 --> 01:06:45.690
<v Speaker 2>like all pissed off too.</v>

2439
01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:46.180
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

2440
01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:47.140
<v Speaker 2>you can't use a,</v>

2441
01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:49.000
<v Speaker 2>like they got rid of it or whatnot.</v>

2442
01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:50.430
<v Speaker 2>Well they were lending history.</v>

2443
01:06:50.431 --> 01:06:50.621
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2444
01:06:50.621 --> 01:06:51.940
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck kind of history is.</v>

2445
01:06:52.450 --> 01:06:53.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2446
01:06:53.030 --> 01:06:56.810
<v Speaker 2>That's a history you want to fucking keep or knowledge of the Nazis hung onto</v>

2447
01:06:56.830 --> 01:06:57.663
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2448
01:06:57.700 --> 01:07:01.060
<v Speaker 2>Germans like there was one time when we were strong.</v>

2449
01:07:02.690 --> 01:07:03.130
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2450
01:07:03.130 --> 01:07:03.963
<v Speaker 2>Or the rise</v>

2451
01:07:03.970 --> 01:07:04.650
<v Speaker 3>rising,</v>

2452
01:07:04.650 --> 01:07:05.483
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2453
01:07:06.010 --> 01:07:06.880
<v Speaker 2>rising sun.</v>

2454
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:11.540
<v Speaker 2>That rising sign is still a big issue with a lot of fighters that have that</v>

2455
01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:13.340
<v Speaker 2>attitude is p hat.</v>

2456
01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:14.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2457
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:17.020
<v Speaker 2>But some fighters have that tattooed and you know,</v>

2458
01:07:17.021 --> 01:07:19.150
<v Speaker 2>some people think it's incredibly offensive.</v>

2459
01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:22.360
<v Speaker 2>Koreans and Chinese people really get offended by it.</v>

2460
01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:23.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2461
01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:23.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2462
01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:24.513
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2463
01:07:25.070 --> 01:07:25.390
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2464
01:07:25.390 --> 01:07:28.340
<v Speaker 2>it's easy for people outside of that to not understand what this,</v>

2465
01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:30.640
<v Speaker 2>those symbols actually actually mean.</v>

2466
01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:31.840
<v Speaker 2>So this is an interesting fight.</v>

2467
01:07:31.870 --> 01:07:33.430
<v Speaker 2>Cavalera he's a bad motherfucker.</v>

2468
01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:34.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2469
01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:34.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2470
01:07:34.510 --> 01:07:35.343
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

2471
01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:38.170
<v Speaker 2>not familiar with Dallas and neither am I.</v>

2472
01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:38.171
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

2473
01:07:38.171 --> 01:07:38.811
<v Speaker 2>I know he fought.</v>

2474
01:07:38.811 --> 01:07:39.521
<v Speaker 2>And Gloria before,</v>

2475
01:07:39.521 --> 01:07:40.600
<v Speaker 2>this is like his second fight.</v>

2476
01:07:40.601 --> 01:07:41.351
<v Speaker 2>His first fight,</v>

2477
01:07:41.351 --> 01:07:41.441
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2478
01:07:41.441 --> 01:07:43.720
<v Speaker 2>but he took it on like a week's notice and he found a heavyweight.</v>

2479
01:07:44.170 --> 01:07:44.800
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

2480
01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:47.660
<v Speaker 3>So I dunno cause look at the things,</v>

2481
01:07:47.661 --> 01:07:51.730
<v Speaker 3>there's a couple of guys that drop weight on this card and the uh,</v>

2482
01:07:52.570 --> 01:07:54.270
<v Speaker 3>the middleweight turning contender tournament.</v>

2483
01:07:54.310 --> 01:07:54.821
<v Speaker 3>There's this guy,</v>

2484
01:07:54.821 --> 01:07:55.420
<v Speaker 3>macho,</v>

2485
01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:57.820
<v Speaker 3>macho or Machado and Machado.</v>

2486
01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:00.940
<v Speaker 3>He fought on the contender tournament,</v>

2487
01:08:00.941 --> 01:08:02.500
<v Speaker 3>a tool five at Gloria 32,</v>

2488
01:08:02.501 --> 01:08:04.060
<v Speaker 3>but now he's in the Middle Way tournaments.</v>

2489
01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:05.900
<v Speaker 2>So students with Mike's gym,</v>

2490
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.441
<v Speaker 2>he's still,</v>

2491
01:08:06.441 --> 01:08:07.740
<v Speaker 2>even though he's finding to a five,</v>

2492
01:08:07.741 --> 01:08:09.230
<v Speaker 2>it's still carrying some body fat on them.</v>

2493
01:08:10.850 --> 01:08:12.710
<v Speaker 2>How many weight classes glory have now?</v>

2494
01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:16.400
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2496
01:08:17.111 --> 01:08:17.510
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2497
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:18.440
<v Speaker 3>45,</v>

2498
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:19.303
<v Speaker 3>55,</v>

2499
01:08:19.350 --> 01:08:20.900
<v Speaker 3>70 85,</v>

2500
01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:22.820
<v Speaker 3>two oh five and heavyweight.</v>

2501
01:08:23.050 --> 01:08:23.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2502
01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:23.870
<v Speaker 1>they're so close.</v>

2503
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:25.940
<v Speaker 1>Why is it so much like mmm,</v>

2504
01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:26.760
<v Speaker 1>because they're unoriginal,</v>

2505
01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:30.500
<v Speaker 1>original and they want it to be just like the UFC to sell to the UFC fans.</v>

2506
01:08:31.530 --> 01:08:35.000
<v Speaker 1>That's so we did cause they're calling two oh five light heavyweight.</v>

2507
01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:36.470
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

2508
01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:37.970
<v Speaker 1>The UFC is what used to,</v>

2509
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:38.833
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2510
01:08:39.230 --> 01:08:42.110
<v Speaker 1>before the UFC he made the way classes or whatever.</v>

2511
01:08:42.190 --> 01:08:43.520
<v Speaker 1>Middleweight was one 54,</v>

2512
01:08:43.521 --> 01:08:44.331
<v Speaker 1>just like boxing.</v>

2513
01:08:44.331 --> 01:08:44.551
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2514
01:08:44.551 --> 01:08:45.384
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2515
01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:47.840
<v Speaker 1>and then there's like junior light heavy.</v>

2516
01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:49.760
<v Speaker 1>There's like a million types of middleweights.</v>

2517
01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:50.040
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2518
01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:50.570
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2519
01:08:50.570 --> 01:08:50.720
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2520
01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:54.000
<v Speaker 1>Well middle weight was one 60 but it was one 54 to one 60 right.</v>

2521
01:08:54.050 --> 01:08:59.050
<v Speaker 1>Super Middleweight one 68 light heavyweight one 75 cruiserweight one 95 there</v>

2522
01:08:59.211 --> 01:09:01.040
<v Speaker 1>was a time where,</v>

2523
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:05.660
<v Speaker 1>you know the UFC didn't even have a 55 when eve Edwards as the baddest</v>

2524
01:09:05.661 --> 01:09:07.460
<v Speaker 1>motherfucking 55 on the planet.</v>

2525
01:09:07.750 --> 01:09:09.530
<v Speaker 1>You were the uncrown champ man.</v>

2526
01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:10.610
<v Speaker 1>It's a long time ago.</v>

2527
01:09:10.790 --> 01:09:11.541
<v Speaker 1>Long time ago.</v>

2528
01:09:11.541 --> 01:09:16.100
<v Speaker 1>But you were the uncrown champ when the UFC eliminated that right after you</v>

2529
01:09:16.101 --> 01:09:17.480
<v Speaker 1>knocked out Josh Thompson,</v>

2530
01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:22.430
<v Speaker 1>you were the consensus best 155 pound guy in the planet.</v>

2531
01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:24.600
<v Speaker 1>And then the UFC said yeah,</v>

2532
01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:25.730
<v Speaker 1>it never really ended this way.</v>

2533
01:09:25.731 --> 01:09:26.564
<v Speaker 1>Class.</v>

2534
01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2535
01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:30.710
<v Speaker 1>That was in the hemorrhaging money money days.</v>

2536
01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:31.573
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have any money.</v>

2537
01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:33.080
<v Speaker 1>No kind of sucked.</v>

2538
01:09:33.081 --> 01:09:34.100
<v Speaker 1>But it is what it is.</v>

2539
01:09:34.101 --> 01:09:34.934
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2540
01:09:35.230 --> 01:09:36.950
<v Speaker 1>No Man should give you a fucking belt though.</v>

2541
01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:37.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2542
01:09:37.690 --> 01:09:39.090
<v Speaker 1>This is break you off of this.</v>

2543
01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:39.850
<v Speaker 1>Break you off.</v>

2544
01:09:39.850 --> 01:09:40.900
<v Speaker 1>Shit out this.</v>

2545
01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:43.080
<v Speaker 1>This is still something for the Mantel.</v>

2546
01:09:43.410 --> 01:09:45.110
<v Speaker 1>And I just go home and I put my,</v>

2547
01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:46.221
<v Speaker 1>put my,</v>

2548
01:09:46.221 --> 01:09:47.520
<v Speaker 1>I make a playlist on,</v>

2549
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:49.310
<v Speaker 1>on fight pass and</v>

2550
01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:52.340
<v Speaker 1>watch my journey to the title.</v>

2551
01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Pretend that I can just take a burlap sack.</v>

2552
01:09:55.641 --> 01:09:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Philadelphia,</v>

2553
01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:56.873
<v Speaker 1>the light bulbs</v>

2554
01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:00.650
<v Speaker 1>you hear that sounds like a burlap sack.</v>

2555
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:07.340
<v Speaker 1>Didn't know in that fight Aaron Riley had happened his entire lower jaw</v>

2556
01:10:07.610 --> 01:10:11.630
<v Speaker 1>reconstructed with like metal and have his teeth wired into place.</v>

2557
01:10:11.631 --> 01:10:12.930
<v Speaker 1>And I did.</v>

2558
01:10:13.490 --> 01:10:14.900
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know he had all those wires.</v>

2559
01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:16.070
<v Speaker 1>I knew he had to have surgery.</v>

2560
01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:17.290
<v Speaker 1>I knew he had surgery goes,</v>

2561
01:10:17.291 --> 01:10:18.320
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty significant.</v>

2562
01:10:18.321 --> 01:10:20.570
<v Speaker 1>I think you literally broke the,</v>

2563
01:10:20.571 --> 01:10:24.050
<v Speaker 1>where the teeth connect to his lower jaw.</v>

2564
01:10:24.051 --> 01:10:25.550
<v Speaker 1>I think you snapped all that.</v>

2565
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:29.840
<v Speaker 1>Hence the light bulb analogy.</v>

2566
01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:32.630
<v Speaker 1>It makes more sense now that for sure.</v>

2567
01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:33.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2568
01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:36.710
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like it's Dick move into the house and you're like,</v>

2569
01:10:36.711 --> 01:10:37.700
<v Speaker 1>I know he had surgery.</v>

2570
01:10:37.701 --> 01:10:37.821
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

01:11:13.981 --> 01:11:14.814
<v Speaker 1>He went there if like,</v>

2591
01:11:14.850 --> 01:11:16.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean you always go into a fight.</v>

2592
01:11:16.261 --> 01:11:16.771
<v Speaker 1>Confident,</v>

2593
01:11:16.771 --> 01:11:17.970
<v Speaker 1>but he went into that fight.</v>

2594
01:11:17.971 --> 01:11:19.380
<v Speaker 1>It's confidence leaving can beat.</v>

2595
01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:20.613
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2596
01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:22.380

2597
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:23.041
<v Speaker 1>hello world.</v>

2598

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2600
01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:29.370
<v Speaker 1>That was when Anderson was really like,</v>

2601
01:11:29.610 --> 01:11:34.510
<v Speaker 1>he had taken time off of pride and then he went and fought in cage rage and he</v>

2602
01:11:34.511 --> 01:11:35.131
<v Speaker 1>cage rage.</v>

2603
01:11:35.131 --> 01:11:37.890
<v Speaker 1>It really came into his own when he fought cage rage.</v>

2604
01:11:37.891 --> 01:11:41.100
<v Speaker 1>Those are some of the most impressive fights you ever had an entire career.</v>

2605
01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:42.031

<v Speaker 1>Beat the fuck out of Lee Marie.</v>

2609
01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:49.830
<v Speaker 1>Beat the fuck out of him and Lee Marie was scary back then.</v>

2610
01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:51.050
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't Lee Marie like a,</v>

2611
01:11:51.070 --> 01:11:53.820
<v Speaker 1>I heard he's like a fucking debt collector or something over there.</v>

2612
01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:54.070

01:12:02.521 --> 01:12:06.810
<v Speaker 1>He was one part of the biggest armed robbery in the history of England.</v>

2620
01:12:08.190 --> 01:12:09.780
<v Speaker 1>He's still in jail in Morocco.</v>

2621
01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.080
<v Speaker 1>He got a girl pregnant from jail.</v>

2622
01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:14.430
<v Speaker 1>That's how strong his comments.</v>

2623
01:12:16.230 --> 01:12:19.530
<v Speaker 1>He fathered a child while he was in the pokey Pablo Escobar stuff.</v>

2624
01:12:20.490 --> 01:12:20.881
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2627
01:12:24.301 --> 01:12:25.320

<v Speaker 1>do you remember that fight?</v>

2629
01:12:26.850 --> 01:12:28.080
<v Speaker 1>We're Rivera.</v>

2630
01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:33.140
<v Speaker 1>He let Rivera Punch him in the face cause Rivera was like a hard hitter and he</v>

2631
01:12:33.211 --> 01:12:37.350
<v Speaker 1>stood right in front of Rivera and Rivera clinch out with them and hit it with</v>

2632
01:12:37.351 --> 01:12:38.184
<v Speaker 1>bombs.</v>

2633
01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:39.031
<v Speaker 1>He's stood out.</v>

2634
01:12:39.031 --> 01:12:40.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at him hitting him</v>

2635
01:12:41.810 --> 01:12:43.170
<v Speaker 1>and if he needs to be a beast,</v>

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:35.333
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:37.303
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

2671
01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:39.150
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>

2672
01:13:39.151 --> 01:13:40.350
<v Speaker 1>Some of the losses that he had,</v>

2673
01:13:40.351 --> 01:13:42.210
<v Speaker 1>the like the Real Joan and oh yeah.</v>

2674
01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:44.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like had a broken foot going into that fight.</v>

2675
01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2676
01:13:45.810 --> 01:13:46.643
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

2677
01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:47.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2678
01:13:47.370 --> 01:13:50.160
<v Speaker 1>Real CHONe and hit him with the craziest flying scissor.</v>

2679
01:13:50.161 --> 01:13:50.940
<v Speaker 1>He'll hook,</v>

2680
01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:51.541
<v Speaker 1>tap out.</v>

2681
01:13:51.541 --> 01:13:51.960
<v Speaker 1>Ever.</v>

2682
01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:54.460
<v Speaker 1>Was it on that foot like you probably like right away</v>

2683
01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:56.830
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

2684
01:13:56.830 --> 01:13:58.250
<v Speaker 1>but I honestly chose him,</v>

2685
01:13:58.270 --> 01:13:59.880
<v Speaker 1>was beating him on the feet.</v>

2686
01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:01.920
<v Speaker 1>Anderson did not look good in that fight.</v>

2687
01:14:01.921 --> 01:14:03.210
<v Speaker 1>His timing was off.</v>

2688
01:14:03.211 --> 01:14:04.044
<v Speaker 1>It was tentative.</v>

2689
01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:06.270
<v Speaker 1>He just wasn't properly prepared.</v>

2690
01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:10.620
<v Speaker 1>But that was also when he was going through this transitionary period where he</v>

2691
01:14:10.621 --> 01:14:11.260
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

2692
01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:11.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2693
01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:14.920
<v Speaker 1>shoot the box and he started Moitai Dream Team.</v>

2694
01:14:14.921 --> 01:14:15.490
<v Speaker 1>You remember that?</v>

2695
01:14:15.490 --> 01:14:16.240
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2696
01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:16.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2697
01:14:16.451 --> 01:14:16.780
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2698
01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:17.613
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2699
01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:18.790
<v Speaker 1>he had uh,</v>

2700
01:14:20.050 --> 01:14:22.870
<v Speaker 1>like left and then sort of established is,</v>

2701
01:14:22.871 --> 01:14:26.220
<v Speaker 1>it was like he was in the middle of like transitioning between gyms and I,</v>

2702
01:14:26.221 --> 01:14:29.680
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think he was trained as well as he had been in the past.</v>

2703
01:14:32.770 --> 01:14:34.120
<v Speaker 1>What's your favorite all time?</v>

2704
01:14:34.150 --> 01:14:34.351
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2705
01:14:34.351 --> 01:14:35.230
<v Speaker 1>and not even all the time.</v>

2706
01:14:35.231 --> 01:14:36.940
<v Speaker 1>Let's just go back to,</v>

2707
01:14:37.210 --> 01:14:38.710
<v Speaker 1>because you've been doing this for a long time,</v>

2708
01:14:38.711 --> 01:14:40.900
<v Speaker 1>even watching them and may the whole time it's been around.</v>

2709
01:14:40.901 --> 01:14:41.734
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

2710
01:14:42.010 --> 01:14:44.650
<v Speaker 1>what's your favorite MMA fight from back in the day?</v>

2711
01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:47.200
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

2712
01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:48.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I have a favorite.</v>

2713
01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:51.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I have a favorite,</v>

2714
01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:55.360
<v Speaker 1>but I remember looking forward to those Vandelay fights more than anything on</v>

2715
01:14:55.361 --> 01:14:56.194
<v Speaker 1>the planet.</v>

2716
01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:56.980
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

2717
01:14:56.980 --> 01:14:57.813
<v Speaker 1>my all time,</v>

2718
01:14:57.940 --> 01:14:58.301
<v Speaker 1>he'll be like,</v>

2719
01:14:58.301 --> 01:14:58.901
<v Speaker 1>at the time,</v>

2720
01:14:58.901 --> 01:15:03.901
<v Speaker 1>at least my favorite just cause he was just fucking tornado of chaos.</v>

2721
01:15:05.650 --> 01:15:07.000
<v Speaker 1>He was so primal,</v>

2722
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:07.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2723
01:15:07.601 --> 01:15:11.590
<v Speaker 1>it was just so filled with rage and he would be looking at the guy across the</v>

2724
01:15:11.591 --> 01:15:13.990
<v Speaker 1>ring and doing that shit with his wrist where his role,</v>

2725
01:15:13.991 --> 01:15:14.824
<v Speaker 1>his hands.</v>

2726
01:15:15.250 --> 01:15:18.700
<v Speaker 1>He was just so fucking crazy like snake.</v>

2727
01:15:18.850 --> 01:15:19.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2728
01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:20.610
<v Speaker 1>Fucking like he uh,</v>

2729
01:15:21.310 --> 01:15:23.230
<v Speaker 1>he was so crazy context or what.</v>

2730
01:15:24.490 --> 01:15:27.430
<v Speaker 1>But I think like when cro cop knocked him out,</v>

2731
01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:32.460
<v Speaker 1>that was one of my favorite fights too because the style that Vandelay used was</v>

2732
01:15:33.251 --> 01:15:36.160
<v Speaker 1>not a technical style.</v>

2733
01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.620
<v Speaker 1>Like he swung punches with his arms.</v>

2734
01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:41.830
<v Speaker 1>He was very overly muscled juice to the tits,</v>

2735
01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:45.340
<v Speaker 1>just fucking jacked and super aggressive.</v>

2736
01:15:45.730 --> 01:15:46.241
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2737
01:15:46.241 --> 01:15:48.520
<v Speaker 1>he knocked a lot of guys out and want a lot of fights.</v>

2738
01:15:48.521 --> 01:15:51.310
<v Speaker 1>But when you saw that shit against cro cop,</v>

2739
01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:54.820
<v Speaker 1>it was just not flying and it just was not going to happen.</v>

2740
01:15:54.850 --> 01:15:58.990
<v Speaker 1>Like Cro cop was at a completely different level when he came to striking.</v>

2741
01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:03.490
<v Speaker 1>And then in that fight Vandelay striking was exposed because I remember watching</v>

2742
01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:03.971
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

2743
01:16:03.971 --> 01:16:08.770
<v Speaker 1>a of an old school Vandelay fight with a friend of mine who was a striker who</v>

2744
01:16:08.771 --> 01:16:09.431
<v Speaker 1>knew how to box.</v>

2745
01:16:09.431 --> 01:16:09.701
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2746
01:16:09.701 --> 01:16:09.971
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2747
01:16:09.971 --> 01:16:12.010
<v Speaker 1>this guy throws his wild ass punches.</v>

2748
01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:12.390
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2749
01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:12.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2750
01:16:12.551 --> 01:16:14.590
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't cover his chin and he just,</v>

2751
01:16:14.591 --> 01:16:15.220
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

2752
01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:19.830
<v Speaker 1>everything is arm punches and looping like MMA striking is kind of fucked up.</v>

2753
01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:20.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2754
01:16:20.170 --> 01:16:21.003
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

2755
01:16:21.370 --> 01:16:21.641
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2756
01:16:21.641 --> 01:16:23.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's easier said than done.</v>

2757
01:16:23.441 --> 01:16:26.590
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of good strikers who stood in front of Angela and panicked</v>

2758
01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:29.770
<v Speaker 1>cause he was just so fucking crazy and screaming and</v>

2759
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:32.830
<v Speaker 1>all he has to do is land one of those.</v>

2760
01:16:33.630 --> 01:16:34.463
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2761
01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:36.460
<v Speaker 1>But I'm with Cro,</v>

2762
01:16:36.461 --> 01:16:37.180
<v Speaker 1>cop,</v>

2763
01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:37.391
<v Speaker 1>Cro,</v>

2764
01:16:37.391 --> 01:16:38.090
<v Speaker 1>cop it,</v>

2765
01:16:38.090 --> 01:16:39.100
<v Speaker 1>the first fight,</v>

2766
01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:41.110
<v Speaker 1>it was one of those weird rules.</v>

2767
01:16:41.111 --> 01:16:41.451
<v Speaker 1>Fights.</v>

2768
01:16:41.451 --> 01:16:43.570
<v Speaker 1>I remember that they had shorter rounds.</v>

2769
01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:45.550
<v Speaker 1>They limited the amount of time on the ground.</v>

2770
01:16:46.510 --> 01:16:46.991
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>

2771
01:16:46.991 --> 01:16:48.040
<v Speaker 1>and it was a draw.</v>

2772
01:16:48.130 --> 01:16:53.130
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a fight where they had a distinctive decision like you couldn't me,</v>

2773
01:16:53.170 --> 01:16:54.220
<v Speaker 1>we'll make any on that.</v>

2774
01:16:55.710 --> 01:16:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Because the betting line was the,</v>

2775
01:16:59.851 --> 01:17:00.491
<v Speaker 1>I guess the,</v>

2776
01:17:00.491 --> 01:17:00.811
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2777
01:17:00.811 --> 01:17:01.030
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2778
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:02.590
<v Speaker 1>the people putting up the betting line,</v>

2779
01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:05.080
<v Speaker 1>they didn't realize that if the fight went to the distance,</v>

2780
01:17:05.081 --> 01:17:06.310
<v Speaker 1>it was a draw automatic.</v>

2781
01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:07.121
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2782
01:17:07.121 --> 01:17:08.290
<v Speaker 1>so they bet for the draw.</v>

2783
01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:10.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2784
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:11.600
<v Speaker 1>And they paid out to,</v>

2785
01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:12.170
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>

2786
01:17:12.170 --> 01:17:12.980
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

2787
01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:15.410
<v Speaker 1>But that was back when you could fucking Ben Online,</v>

2788
01:17:15.411 --> 01:17:16.160
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2789
01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:16.420
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2790
01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:17.930
<v Speaker 1>they got to bring that back.</v>

2791
01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:20.060
<v Speaker 1>I would be betting on everything online.</v>

2792
01:17:20.061 --> 01:17:21.530
<v Speaker 1>If online betting was still there,</v>

2793
01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:23.150
<v Speaker 1>I'd been on this for fun.</v>

2794
01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:24.290
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

2795
01:17:24.290 --> 01:17:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2796
01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:26.340
<v Speaker 1>This isn't the books here at kings is,</v>

2797
01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:27.193
<v Speaker 1>are they shut draft,</v>

2798
01:17:27.310 --> 01:17:29.090
<v Speaker 1>draft draftkings is fantasy.</v>

2799
01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:29.953
<v Speaker 1>It's different.</v>

2800
01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:31.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2801
01:17:31.130 --> 01:17:31.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2802
01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:32.330
<v Speaker 1>you pick fighters,</v>

2803
01:17:32.331 --> 01:17:33.081
<v Speaker 1>you pick rounds.</v>

2804
01:17:33.081 --> 01:17:34.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like a sneaky way of getting around.</v>

2805
01:17:34.731 --> 01:17:37.130
<v Speaker 1>Gambling could kind of gamble,</v>

2806
01:17:37.131 --> 01:17:38.570
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the same.</v>

2807
01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:41.630
<v Speaker 1>I want to be able to bet 50 bucks on this guy.</v>

2808
01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:43.460
<v Speaker 1>I want to bet 100 bucks on that guy.</v>

2809
01:17:43.461 --> 01:17:46.400
<v Speaker 1>I want to be able to bet I'm a fucking grown man.</v>

2810
01:17:46.401 --> 01:17:47.420
<v Speaker 1>I pay taxes.</v>

2811
01:17:48.890 --> 01:17:49.723
<v Speaker 1>American.</v>

2812
01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:51.170
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that what Bo dog was?</v>

2813
01:17:51.290 --> 01:17:52.123
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2814
01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:53.330
<v Speaker 1>Well that's why that guy,</v>

2815
01:17:53.331 --> 01:17:55.460
<v Speaker 1>Calvin Ayre had to leave the country.</v>

2816
01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:56.360
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2817
01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:56.661
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

2818
01:17:56.661 --> 01:18:01.661
<v Speaker 1>he's a criminal because he had all this online gambling shit going on and he was</v>

2819
01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:03.380
<v Speaker 1>an American citizen,</v>

2820
01:18:03.381 --> 01:18:05.090
<v Speaker 1>so he can't even live in America anymore.</v>

2821
01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:05.961
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

2822
01:18:05.961 --> 01:18:08.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think he's allowed to visit America.</v>

2823
01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:10.610
<v Speaker 1>I think Calvin Ayre lives in like Costa Rica.</v>

2824
01:18:10.910 --> 01:18:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember Calvin air?</v>

2825
01:18:11.871 --> 01:18:13.040
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember Bo dog fight?</v>

2826
01:18:13.190 --> 01:18:15.770
<v Speaker 1>I remember about does somebody else like that too?</v>

2827
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:16.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2828
01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:17.570
<v Speaker 1>it was a gang of those guys.</v>

2829
01:18:18.710 --> 01:18:19.543
<v Speaker 1>Shoot,</v>

2830
01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:20.780
<v Speaker 1>I forget his name.</v>

2831
01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:22.940
<v Speaker 1>There turned a bunch of entrepreneurs and the criminals</v>

2832
01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:26.810
<v Speaker 1>just change the law America.</v>

2833
01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:28.243
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

2834
01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:29.151
<v Speaker 1>But Calvin,</v>

2835
01:18:29.151 --> 01:18:31.070
<v Speaker 1>I had some great fights,</v>

2836
01:18:31.071 --> 01:18:31.610

2838
01:18:33.381 --> 01:18:34.940
<v Speaker 1>And that was the first Chell Senate fight.</v>

2839
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:37.550
<v Speaker 1>Cain Velasquez headed first fight on Bodog.</v>

2840
01:18:38.210 --> 01:18:38.840
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2841
01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:39.770

01:18:48.651 --> 01:18:52.630
<v Speaker 1>He put on some good fights and he put him on the beach and the girls were bang</v>

2849
01:18:52.670 --> 01:18:57.670
<v Speaker 1>and he had ring card girls that just cheesiness gamma was always like on a beach</v>

2850
01:19:00.591 --> 01:19:01.110
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>

2851
01:19:01.110 --> 01:19:02.690
<v Speaker 1>So most include Costa Rica.</v>

2852
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:03.530
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2853
01:19:03.530 --> 01:19:04.280
<v Speaker 1>Costa Rica.</v>

2854
01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:04.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2855
01:19:04.521 --> 01:19:06.560
<v Speaker 1>He put everything on like where he likes to hang out.</v>

2856
01:19:06.670 --> 01:19:07.503
<v Speaker 1>It's like shit,</v>

2857
01:19:07.670 --> 01:19:07.791
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2858
01:19:07.791 --> 01:19:08.624
<v Speaker 1>have a fight here.</v>

2859
01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:10.280
<v Speaker 1>And then once was in Russia,</v>

2860
01:19:10.281 --> 01:19:11.114
<v Speaker 1>that kind of sucked.</v>

2861
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.991
<v Speaker 1>It was cold.</v>

2862
01:19:11.991 --> 01:19:12.621
<v Speaker 1>It was November.</v>

2863
01:19:12.621 --> 01:19:12.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2864
01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:13.710
<v Speaker 1>He did it in Russian.</v>

2865
01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:14.690
<v Speaker 1>He had fade or fight.</v>

2866
01:19:14.691 --> 01:19:15.524
<v Speaker 1>Matt Lindland.</v>

2867
01:19:15.770 --> 01:19:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Yup,</v>

2868
01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:17.030

01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:17.630
<v Speaker 1>Remember that?</v>

2870
01:19:17.630 --> 01:19:21.560
<v Speaker 1>And I think Matt Lindland got fucked in the fight.</v>

2871
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:24.020
<v Speaker 1>Remember fade or grab the ropes.</v>

2872
01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:29.390
<v Speaker 1>Matt Lindland got the clinch on fader and Matt Lindland was about to take</v>

2873
01:19:29.391 --> 01:19:34.391
<v Speaker 1>forward fade or down a fade or grab the ropes and held on hard and then reverse</v>

2874
01:19:34.461 --> 01:19:38.120
<v Speaker 1>the position because he grabbed the ropes.</v>

2875
01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:39.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2876
01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:42.800
<v Speaker 1>I remember that and I think Matt Lindland got fucked financially too,</v>

2877
01:19:42.801 --> 01:19:43.790
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly.</v>

2878
01:19:43.791 --> 01:19:47.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he got paid or he didn't get paid what he's supposed to get paid</v>

2879
01:19:47.211 --> 01:19:47.631
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>

2880
01:19:47.631 --> 01:19:48.980
<v Speaker 1>There was some sort of controversy,</v>

2881
01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:52.160
<v Speaker 1>but the controversy about the takedown was gigantic.</v>

2882
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if it,</v>

2883
01:19:56.871 --> 01:19:59.180
<v Speaker 1>Matt Linden would've beaten Fader at that time?</v>

2884
01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:00.133
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

2885
01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:02.630
<v Speaker 1>I've been crazy at that time.</v>

2886
01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:03.620
<v Speaker 1>Fade or was fate or,</v>

2887
01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:04.430
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2888
01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:05.750

01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:18.600
<v Speaker 2>I feel like Fade Oren pride.</v>

2905
01:20:32.731 --> 01:20:33.780
<v Speaker 2>But the pride contract,</v>

2906
01:20:34.130 --> 01:20:36.930
<v Speaker 2>the contract says this is what it reads.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the rest of the night we're done.</v>

3056
01:24:25.510 --> 01:24:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Like we went to a bus,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Simon Marcus,</v>

01:25:32.030 --> 01:25:32.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Jason Wellness fight?</v>

3099
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:34.910
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever want to watch that?</v>

3100
01:25:34.911 --> 01:25:35.601
<v Speaker 1>Saw The highlight?</v>

3101
01:25:35.601 --> 01:25:37.730
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see crazy fight.</v>

3102
01:25:38.410 --> 01:25:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm crazy fight dude.</v>

3103
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:43.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like all the wind went out out of Simon sales.</v>

3104
01:25:43.370 --> 01:25:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Like Jason Wellness was getting battered early on and Simon look fantastic.</v>

3105
01:25:47.631 --> 01:25:49.160
<v Speaker 1>You look super aggressive,</v>

3106
01:25:49.161 --> 01:25:50.060
<v Speaker 1>super strong.</v>

3107
01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:52.010
<v Speaker 1>But then somewhere,</v>

3108
01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:55.640
<v Speaker 1>somewhere around the second round it looked like he's was just losing all of his</v>

3109
01:25:55.641 --> 01:25:57.420
<v Speaker 1>pop and then he did some weird things.</v>

3110
01:25:57.430 --> 01:25:59.300
<v Speaker 1>You see that weird thing he did against the ropes?</v>

3111
01:25:59.510 --> 01:26:00.470
<v Speaker 1>That's all he was stood there.</v>

3112
01:26:01.190 --> 01:26:03.440
<v Speaker 1>He is like a bravado kind of thing.</v>

3113
01:26:03.650 --> 01:26:03.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3114
01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 1>Let</v>

3115
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:04.960
<v Speaker 5>them tee off on him.</v>

3116
01:26:04.961 --> 01:26:08.000
<v Speaker 5>One give it to me and then fucking gave it to him or I gave it to him.</v>

3117
01:26:08.050 --> 01:26:09.320
<v Speaker 5>I have my wellness can crack.</v>

3118
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:10.820
<v Speaker 5>We didn't know that more than anybody.</v>

3119
01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:11.713
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3120
01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:13.761
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3121
01:26:13.761 --> 01:26:15.050
<v Speaker 5>That should be interesting.</v>

3122
01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:19.010
<v Speaker 5>It looked to me like a Simon sounds even like Simon was getting tired and you</v>

3123
01:26:19.011 --> 01:26:19.470
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

3124
01:26:19.470 --> 01:26:21.890
<v Speaker 5>and I had heard that he's not with his old coach anymore.</v>

3125
01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:23.331
<v Speaker 5>It's maybe that's it.</v>

3126
01:26:23.331 --> 01:26:24.150
<v Speaker 5>But the,</v>

3127
01:26:24.150 --> 01:26:25.810
<v Speaker 5>as I as asking Eva,</v>

3128
01:26:26.690 --> 01:26:28.460
<v Speaker 5>being in Denver when I fought there,</v>

3129
01:26:28.461 --> 01:26:29.600
<v Speaker 5>it makes a big difference.</v>

3130
01:26:29.601 --> 01:26:31.430
<v Speaker 5>The high altitude and a,</v>

3131
01:26:31.470 --> 01:26:32.810
<v Speaker 5>he's fighting Dustin Jacoby,</v>

3132
01:26:32.811 --> 01:26:34.680
<v Speaker 5>who I don't think it's anywhere near the,</v>

3133
01:26:35.110 --> 01:26:38.270
<v Speaker 5>the caliber fighter to fight a guy like Simon,</v>

3134
01:26:38.271 --> 01:26:40.940
<v Speaker 5>but he's from Denver and that gives them a lot of advantage of,</v>

3135
01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:42.133
<v Speaker 5>that's tonight.</v>

3136
01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:42.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3137
01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:44.480
<v Speaker 5>Do you think assignment should recover though?</v>

3138
01:26:44.490 --> 01:26:47.060
<v Speaker 5>Mean he got knocked the fuck out just a couple of months ago?</v>

3139
01:26:47.090 --> 01:26:47.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3140
01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:49.160
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's good either.</v>

3141
01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:49.560
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3142
01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:49.850
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

3143
01:26:49.850 --> 01:26:50.810
<v Speaker 5>When I knocked him out,</v>

3144
01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:52.290
<v Speaker 5>he fought again.</v>

3145
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.391
<v Speaker 5>Like I said,</v>

3146
01:26:53.391 --> 01:26:54.280
<v Speaker 5>it's got like that fun part,</v>

3147
01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:55.401
<v Speaker 5>but in China,</v>

3148
01:26:55.401 --> 01:26:58.790
<v Speaker 5>like I don't know right away and it got knocked out again.</v>

3149
01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.020
<v Speaker 5>Who Killed Him and China?</v>

3150
01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:01.400
<v Speaker 5>I forget the guy's name.</v>

3151
01:27:02.630 --> 01:27:03.350
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember,</v>

3152
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:04.010
<v Speaker 5>but it was an upset.</v>

3153
01:27:04.010 --> 01:27:04.551
<v Speaker 5>It's on youtube,</v>

3154
01:27:04.551 --> 01:27:05.480
<v Speaker 5>but that was a big upset.</v>

3155
01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:07.520
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of scary.</v>

3156
01:27:07.521 --> 01:27:07.731
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

3157
01:27:07.731 --> 01:27:09.020
<v Speaker 1>you heard about um,</v>

3158
01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Jordan portions,</v>

3159
01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:12.710
<v Speaker 1>CTE like 25.</v>

3160
01:27:12.711 --> 01:27:13.544
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3161
01:27:13.610 --> 01:27:16.610
<v Speaker 1>And he only had two losses and one by Kao.</v>

3162
01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:17.941
<v Speaker 1>It's like I,</v>

3163
01:27:17.941 --> 01:27:19.950
<v Speaker 1>I know we got CTE man,</v>

3164
01:27:20.070 --> 01:27:21.030
<v Speaker 1>like CTE,</v>

3165
01:27:21.670 --> 01:27:23.630
<v Speaker 1>chronic traumatic encephalopathy,</v>

<v Speaker 1>except for head trauma from head trauma.</v>

3167
01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:26.990
<v Speaker 1>Brain damage.</v>

3168
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:27.823
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3169
01:27:28.130 --> 01:27:31.250
<v Speaker 1>But they can't test it and they can't see it until you're dead.</v>

3170
01:27:31.930 --> 01:27:33.740
<v Speaker 1>Postmodern ma or to autopsy.</v>

3171
01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:34.910
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3172
01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:38.960
<v Speaker 1>so it was all it he had it or if the car portions want me to hit by the car.</v>

3173
01:27:38.961 --> 01:27:39.131
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

3174
01:27:39.131 --> 01:27:39.391
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3175
01:27:39.391 --> 01:27:40.224
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3176
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:43.280
<v Speaker 1>And he was only 25 and then they found out that he had that and didn't even</v>

3177
01:27:43.281 --> 01:27:43.730
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

3178
01:27:43.730 --> 01:27:44.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3179
01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:44.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3180
01:27:44.570 --> 01:27:45.050
<v Speaker 1>that's awful.</v>

3181
01:27:45.050 --> 01:27:45.231
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3182
01:27:45.231 --> 01:27:47.390
<v Speaker 1>what's crazy is he was okay.</v>

3183
01:27:47.450 --> 01:27:47.841
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3184
01:27:47.841 --> 01:27:48.920
<v Speaker 1>he was articulate.</v>

3185
01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:49.330
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

3186
01:27:49.330 --> 01:27:50.300
<v Speaker 1>he fought well,</v>

3187
01:27:50.301 --> 01:27:51.890
<v Speaker 1>he functioning fully functioning,</v>

3188
01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:53.840
<v Speaker 1>and then they do this test on them and they're like,</v>

3189
01:27:53.841 --> 01:27:54.674
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3190
01:27:54.890 --> 01:27:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3191
01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:58.340
<v Speaker 1>what they're concerned with is that they're missing out on,</v>

3192
01:27:58.580 --> 01:27:58.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3193
01:27:58.821 --> 01:28:01.010
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the damage that,</v>

3194
01:28:01.011 --> 01:28:01.844
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3195
01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:02.541
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3196
01:28:02.541 --> 01:28:07.010
<v Speaker 1>you're getting in the gym and that there's no way to really detect it until</v>

3197
01:28:07.011 --> 01:28:07.844
<v Speaker 1>you're dead.</v>

3198
01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:11.690
<v Speaker 1>But it's just like the slow creeping thing that's happening to you.</v>

3199
01:28:13.070 --> 01:28:13.490
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

3200
01:28:13.490 --> 01:28:14.323
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3201
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:15.230
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

3202
01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:17.930
<v Speaker 1>when does it like a guy like Jordan portion is 25 years,</v>

3203
01:28:17.931 --> 01:28:19.130
<v Speaker 1>it'll fully functional,</v>

3204
01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:20.360
<v Speaker 1>articulate.</v>

3205
01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:22.520
<v Speaker 1>He can hang with any conversation.</v>

3206
01:28:22.521 --> 01:28:26.530
<v Speaker 1>But then what does that mean when he's 60 or 44?</v>

3207
01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:27.620
<v Speaker 1>That's the big question.</v>

3208
01:28:27.650 --> 01:28:28.550
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

3209
01:28:28.890 --> 01:28:29.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3210
01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:31.460
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean for a guy like Peter Hertz?</v>

3211
01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:33.770
<v Speaker 1>It has been Kol like 14 times,</v>

3212
01:28:33.771 --> 01:28:34.604
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3213
01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:35.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3214
01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:36.750
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3215
01:28:36.750 --> 01:28:37.583
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3216
01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:38.650
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3217
01:28:38.650 --> 01:28:40.310
<v Speaker 1>Fucking a Cyborg.</v>

3218
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:41.863
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3219
01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:42.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3220
01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:43.810
<v Speaker 1>If he didn't have it before,</v>

3221
01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:44.481
<v Speaker 1>after that me,</v>

3222
01:28:44.481 --> 01:28:45.314
<v Speaker 1>he's got it now.</v>

3223
01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:46.670
<v Speaker 1>He probably has,</v>

3224
01:28:46.670 --> 01:28:48.050
<v Speaker 1>if he has it after,</v>

3225
01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:48.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3226
01:28:48.351 --> 01:28:49.040
<v Speaker 1>just two of them.</v>

3227
01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:49.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I already have it.</v>

3228
01:28:51.230 --> 01:28:51.830
<v Speaker 1>I think we all,</v>

3229
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:52.030
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3230
01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:53.820
<v Speaker 1>I promise you there's,</v>

3231
01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:54.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3232
01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:55.340
<v Speaker 1>they all have a role player.</v>

3233
01:28:55.341 --> 01:28:56.300
<v Speaker 1>My cousin was,</v>

3234
01:28:56.301 --> 01:29:00.170
<v Speaker 1>had had concussions and multiple concussions just playing high school football,</v>

3235
01:29:00.171 --> 01:29:00.610
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3236
01:29:00.610 --> 01:29:01.443
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3237
01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:04.530
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>

3238
01:29:04.610 --> 01:29:05.240
<v Speaker 2>That's probably,</v>

3239
01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:05.721
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3240
01:29:05.721 --> 01:29:05.811
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

3241
01:29:05.811 --> 01:29:06.680
<v Speaker 2>if you could see it,</v>

3242
01:29:06.681 --> 01:29:07.491
<v Speaker 2>that would probably be,</v>

3243
01:29:07.491 --> 01:29:08.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3244
01:29:08.030 --> 01:29:09.380
<v Speaker 2>an epidemic right now.</v>

3245
01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:11.150
<v Speaker 2>If you could see who had it.</v>

3246
01:29:11.260 --> 01:29:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3247
01:29:11.660 --> 01:29:13.600
<v Speaker 1>It was like a light bulb that went off on their head.</v>

3248
01:29:13.650 --> 01:29:14.800
<v Speaker 1>And what do we know about it though?</v>

3249
01:29:15.670 --> 01:29:15.981
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

3250
01:29:15.981 --> 01:29:19.570
<v Speaker 1>What does this degenerative takes time to show it's full affects eight to 10</v>

3251
01:29:19.571 --> 01:29:21.460
<v Speaker 1>years after you're diagnosed with it,</v>

3252
01:29:21.461 --> 01:29:24.160
<v Speaker 1>you really start seeing the damage because it slowly gets worse.</v>

3253
01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:28.060
<v Speaker 1>Start drooling and Sheila depending of course on whether or not you still</v>

3254
01:29:28.061 --> 01:29:28.960
<v Speaker 1>receive damage.</v>

3255
01:29:29.250 --> 01:29:33.540
<v Speaker 2>Supposedly there's some athletes and NFL athletes that either kill themselves or</v>

3256
01:29:33.541 --> 01:29:34.201
<v Speaker 2>did some,</v>

3257
01:29:34.201 --> 01:29:39.150
<v Speaker 2>some extremely violent things because they weren't fully functioning like that.</v>

3258
01:29:39.151 --> 01:29:40.260
<v Speaker 2>A Will Smith movie.</v>

3259
01:29:40.770 --> 01:29:41.551
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

3260
01:29:41.551 --> 01:29:42.570
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what it is.</v>

3261
01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:43.621
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3262
01:29:43.621 --> 01:29:45.350
<v Speaker 2>It's not like they think about like these uh,</v>

3263
01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:46.770
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

3264
01:29:46.770 --> 01:29:49.260
<v Speaker 2>WWF guys are like the pro wrestlers always.</v>

3265
01:29:49.290 --> 01:29:52.950
<v Speaker 2>They always in advantage to fucking psychotic fucking crazy deaths.</v>

3266
01:29:53.310 --> 01:29:53.911
<v Speaker 2>And then everyone's like,</v>

3267
01:29:53.911 --> 01:29:54.091
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3268
01:29:54.091 --> 01:29:55.090
<v Speaker 2>they're on steroids with them.</v>

3269
01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:57.270
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they get fucking slammed in the head and like,</v>

3270
01:29:57.630 --> 01:29:59.610
<v Speaker 2>have you seen Kurt angle outside of the ring?</v>

3271
01:29:59.611 --> 01:30:00.170
<v Speaker 2>Lilly?</v>

3272
01:30:00.170 --> 01:30:01.003
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3273
01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:02.700
<v Speaker 2>He like looks like crippled,</v>

3274
01:30:02.701 --> 01:30:04.050
<v Speaker 2>like can't even turn his hand.</v>

3275
01:30:04.051 --> 01:30:04.840
<v Speaker 2>Even hardly moves.</v>

3276
01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:06.150
<v Speaker 2>Like that man looks terrible.</v>

3277
01:30:06.151 --> 01:30:07.690
<v Speaker 2>And then they turn the camera on and he's like,</v>

3278
01:30:07.710 --> 01:30:08.021
<v Speaker 2>ah.</v>

3279
01:30:08.021 --> 01:30:08.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3280
01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:09.360
<v Speaker 2>I pulled us together,</v>

3281
01:30:09.690 --> 01:30:11.070
<v Speaker 2>but he looks really fucking bad,</v>

3282
01:30:11.071 --> 01:30:11.390
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

3283
01:30:11.390 --> 01:30:12.223
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3284
01:30:13.110 --> 01:30:17.310
<v Speaker 1>A buddy of mine just went to a high school football game and he said in a high</v>

3285
01:30:17.311 --> 01:30:18.240
<v Speaker 1>school football game,</v>

3286
01:30:18.241 --> 01:30:20.820
<v Speaker 1>he saw six kids get laid out,</v>

3287
01:30:21.330 --> 01:30:24.210
<v Speaker 1>just laid out or their boom collide.</v>

3288
01:30:24.211 --> 01:30:29.100
<v Speaker 1>And these kids were just laying down fucking knocked unconscious out of their</v>

3289
01:30:29.101 --> 01:30:29.934
<v Speaker 1>fucking mind.</v>

3290
01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:31.270
<v Speaker 2>No high school football game.</v>

3291
01:30:31.330 --> 01:30:32.230
<v Speaker 2>Think about that though.</v>

3292
01:30:32.231 --> 01:30:34.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're taking some of the Beth and high school there,</v>

3293
01:30:34.991 --> 01:30:35.260
<v Speaker 2>Beth,</v>

3294
01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:36.700
<v Speaker 2>at best athletes in their school.</v>

3295
01:30:36.701 --> 01:30:38.320
<v Speaker 2>But when you get to the NFL level,</v>

3296
01:30:38.321 --> 01:30:38.650
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

3297
01:30:38.650 --> 01:30:40.540
<v Speaker 2>some of the best athletes in the world,</v>

3298
01:30:40.810 --> 01:30:45.490
<v Speaker 2>you put them in a box and you just say go 60 times and they just run into each</v>

3299
01:30:45.491 --> 01:30:46.210
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

3300
01:30:46.210 --> 01:30:47.043
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

3301
01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:48.100
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3302
01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:50.920
<v Speaker 2>you know they're going to have brain trauma.</v>

3303
01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:52.240
<v Speaker 2>This is no way around that.</v>

3304
01:30:53.090 --> 01:30:55.720
<v Speaker 2>All of the money comes in and all of the other,</v>

3305
01:30:55.870 --> 01:30:58.390
<v Speaker 2>the other people like guiding you come into play,</v>

3306
01:30:58.391 --> 01:31:00.550

3325
01:31:25.121 --> 01:31:25.931
<v Speaker 1>but it's my time.</v>

3326
01:31:25.931 --> 01:31:26.764
<v Speaker 1>I am the champ</v>

3327
01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:29.470
<v Speaker 1>fighting was Shin protection.</v>

3328
01:31:29.471 --> 01:31:32.650
<v Speaker 1>I had Garrett's already a household name in Japan where the real men were</v>

3329
01:31:32.651 --> 01:31:34.810
<v Speaker 1>fighting such a g</v>

3330
01:31:37.090 --> 01:31:38.950
<v Speaker 2>let's by like the fourth thing that they were like,</v>

3331
01:31:38.951 --> 01:31:39.131
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3332
01:31:39.131 --> 01:31:41.550
<v Speaker 2>you can't say he wrote another one that he can't say that.</v>

3333
01:31:41.980 --> 01:31:42.311
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3334
01:31:42.311 --> 01:31:43.120
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

3335
01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:43.871
<v Speaker 2>Your household name.</v>

3336
01:31:43.871 --> 01:31:44.111
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3337
01:31:44.111 --> 01:31:44.944
<v Speaker 2>we'll take it.</v>

3338
01:31:45.170 --> 01:31:46.430
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be a crazy fight,</v>

3339
01:31:46.431 --> 01:31:47.264
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3340
01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:48.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3341
01:31:48.220 --> 01:31:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3342
01:31:48.750 --> 01:31:52.790
<v Speaker 1>there's the real problem with all the CTE shit is there's nothing they can do</v>

3343
01:31:52.791 --> 01:31:53.510
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

3344
01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:58.510
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you get a broken bone and they can put in a titanium rod and they</v>

3345
01:31:58.821 --> 01:32:00.400
<v Speaker 1>can screw it in place and yeah,</v>

3346
01:32:00.401 --> 01:32:01.091
<v Speaker 1>my heel up,</v>

3347
01:32:01.091 --> 01:32:02.460
<v Speaker 1>I'll be all right in after awhile.</v>

3348
01:32:04.470 --> 01:32:05.303
<v Speaker 1>CBA.</v>

3349
01:32:05.390 --> 01:32:06.660
<v Speaker 1>But it's just that they don't,</v>

3350
01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:07.840
<v Speaker 1>we don't know that yet.</v>

3351
01:32:07.870 --> 01:32:10.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's nothing they can do about it now.</v>

3352
01:32:10.330 --> 01:32:10.570
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

3353
01:32:10.570 --> 01:32:11.040
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3354
01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:11.560
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

3355
01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:16.270
<v Speaker 1>so I guess the next step would be to be figure out a way to test for it while</v>

3356
01:32:16.271 --> 01:32:17.350
<v Speaker 1>people are still alive.</v>

3357
01:32:17.710 --> 01:32:18.060
<v Speaker 1>But did you,</v>

3358
01:32:18.060 --> 01:32:18.671
<v Speaker 1>when you got up here,</v>

3359
01:32:18.671 --> 01:32:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

3360
01:32:19.090 --> 01:32:19.441
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>

3361
01:32:19.441 --> 01:32:20.580
<v Speaker 1>This is Joe Nemeth is,</v>

3362
01:32:20.610 --> 01:32:21.420
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3363
01:32:21.420 --> 01:32:24.100
<v Speaker 9>he's got under hyperbaric oxygen therapy.</v>

3364
01:32:24.101 --> 01:32:24.490
<v Speaker 9>It says,</v>

3365
01:32:24.490 --> 01:32:25.450
<v Speaker 9>ah.</v>

3366
01:32:25.810 --> 01:32:26.501
<v Speaker 9>He says he's,</v>

3367
01:32:26.501 --> 01:32:27.820
<v Speaker 9>this is his quote right here.</v>

3368
01:32:27.850 --> 01:32:28.840
<v Speaker 9>He's got a trial.</v>

3369
01:32:28.841 --> 01:32:31.990
<v Speaker 9>He's trying to get some money for at a research center where they're going to do</v>

3370
01:32:31.991 --> 01:32:33.160
<v Speaker 9>testing to see if they can.</v>

3371
01:32:33.530 --> 01:32:35.650
<v Speaker 1>So that's my thinking is much clear,</v>

3372
01:32:35.651 --> 01:32:37.120
<v Speaker 1>explains finding the right words.</v>

3373
01:32:37.121 --> 01:32:37.821
<v Speaker 1>It's become easier.</v>

3374
01:32:37.821 --> 01:32:39.880
<v Speaker 1>And I remember events with more clarity.</v>

3375
01:32:39.881 --> 01:32:42.370
<v Speaker 1>One of the really great results of my sleep has improved.</v>

3376
01:32:42.970 --> 01:32:47.290
<v Speaker 1>I sleep more soundly and I have vivid dreams with the therapy now completed.</v>

3377
01:32:47.291 --> 01:32:51.580
<v Speaker 1>Joe maintains that the lasting benefits are both mental and physical and now</v>

3378
01:32:51.581 --> 01:32:52.720
<v Speaker 1>more energy and strength.</v>

3379
01:32:52.721 --> 01:32:53.554
<v Speaker 1>I feel great.</v>

3380
01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:56.680
<v Speaker 1>How much pussy you think he's getting still?</v>

3381
01:32:57.430 --> 01:33:01.460
<v Speaker 1>Joe Nemeth used to walk around with a fucking gigantic for code on when you can</v>

3382
01:33:01.461 --> 01:33:06.400
<v Speaker 1>wear for just balling out of control and the 1970s</v>

3383
01:33:08.110 --> 01:33:09.370
<v Speaker 1>it was an old school dudes,</v>

3384
01:33:09.371 --> 01:33:09.880
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3385
01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:11.320
<v Speaker 1>old school football players,</v>

3386
01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:13.840
<v Speaker 1>they get fucking banged up.</v>

3387
01:33:14.510 --> 01:33:14.841
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

3388
01:33:14.841 --> 01:33:17.750
<v Speaker 5>I think it's few now that they've like recognize this is the thing.</v>

3389
01:33:17.780 --> 01:33:20.920
<v Speaker 5>Then they get started looking in to how you fix it or whatever.</v>

3390
01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:26.440
<v Speaker 5>But I'm sure like CBD oil and altitude hyperbaric chambers and all that Shit,</v>

3391
01:33:28.131 --> 01:33:28.500
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3392
01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:32.010
<v Speaker 1>Well hypobaric is the mushrooms exact opposite of altitude.</v>

3393
01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:34.110
<v Speaker 1>High altitude is low oxygen.</v>

3394
01:33:34.111 --> 01:33:36.540
<v Speaker 1>Hyperbaric is high altitude or</v>

3395
01:33:37.010 --> 01:33:39.580
<v Speaker 5>they find that if they that over,</v>

3396
01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:41.740
<v Speaker 5>they oversaturate you with oxygen,</v>

3397
01:33:41.770 --> 01:33:45.340
<v Speaker 5>that all of your cells tend to open up and then it starts to figure out new ways</v>

3398
01:33:45.341 --> 01:33:46.210
<v Speaker 5>to repair itself.</v>

3399
01:33:46.211 --> 01:33:47.500
<v Speaker 5>Is the idea between that</v>

3400
01:33:48.090 --> 01:33:51.870
<v Speaker 1>it's mostly great for broken bones but supposed to be great when people have</v>

3401
01:33:51.871 --> 01:33:52.351
<v Speaker 1>injuries,</v>

3402
01:33:52.351 --> 01:33:54.480
<v Speaker 1>like a recovery time increases</v>

3403
01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:57.710
<v Speaker 5>well graduate cells increases your red blood cells.</v>

3404
01:33:57.711 --> 01:33:57.861
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3405
01:33:57.861 --> 01:33:59.270
<v Speaker 5>And that's what helps with the healing.</v>

3406
01:34:00.020 --> 01:34:00.411
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3407
01:34:00.411 --> 01:34:01.340
<v Speaker 5>I think that's the,</v>

3408
01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:02.570
<v Speaker 5>that's the hyper.</v>

3409
01:34:03.790 --> 01:34:06.590
<v Speaker 5>The one with less oxygen increases the red blood cells.</v>

3410
01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:09.650
<v Speaker 5>The more oxygen is what repairs.</v>

3411
01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:10.460
<v Speaker 5>Oh.</v>

3412
01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:12.080
<v Speaker 5>And I think that's supposed to be really good for,</v>

3413
01:34:12.081 --> 01:34:13.580
<v Speaker 5>I did it a few times after my,</v>

3414
01:34:13.581 --> 01:34:14.300
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3415
01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:15.530
<v Speaker 5>to repair from like,</v>

3416
01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:16.070
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3417
01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:16.700
<v Speaker 5>knockouts.</v>

3418
01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:17.400
<v Speaker 5>Did you feel it,</v>

3419
01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:18.230
<v Speaker 5>you feel a difference?</v>

3420
01:34:18.230 --> 01:34:20.120
<v Speaker 5>I never had felt a difference ever,</v>

3421
01:34:20.570 --> 01:34:21.470
<v Speaker 5>like negatively,</v>

3422
01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:23.120
<v Speaker 5>but I just did it to be safe,</v>

3423
01:34:23.121 --> 01:34:23.650
<v Speaker 5>safe,</v>

3424
01:34:23.650 --> 01:34:23.950
<v Speaker 5>smart.</v>

3425
01:34:23.950 --> 01:34:27.530
<v Speaker 5>Are you one of those guys who doesn't feel like the effects of things?</v>

3426
01:34:27.531 --> 01:34:30.380
<v Speaker 5>Say you're taking some supplement that's supposed to be great and you don't</v>

3427
01:34:30.381 --> 01:34:31.190
<v Speaker 5>really feel it?</v>

3428
01:34:31.190 --> 01:34:31.521
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3429
01:34:31.521 --> 01:34:35.330
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I have a really good awareness of my body and like I try to,</v>

3430
01:34:35.331 --> 01:34:36.560
<v Speaker 5>I tried to be really good about that,</v>

3431
01:34:36.590 --> 01:34:39.920
<v Speaker 5>but I mean after like being knocked out like I felt could have been knocked out</v>

3432
01:34:39.921 --> 01:34:40.701
<v Speaker 5>I think two times,</v>

3433
01:34:40.701 --> 01:34:44.720
<v Speaker 5>three times now where it was like a half hour after the fire where I still look</v>

3434
01:34:45.260 --> 01:34:46.400
<v Speaker 5>real pretty fucked up,</v>

3435
01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:46.880
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3436
01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:50.150
<v Speaker 5>And then after that happens I'm like really aware of it and like I've even asked</v>

3437
01:34:50.151 --> 01:34:50.920
<v Speaker 5>my girl like my,</v>

3449
01:35:05.061 --> 01:35:07.430
<v Speaker 1>But ironically good for your brain.</v>

3450
01:35:07.450 --> 01:35:07.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3451
01:35:07.730 --> 01:35:09.350
<v Speaker 1>it's good for inflammation,</v>

3452
01:35:11.630 --> 01:35:12.321
<v Speaker 1>but you never know.</v>

3453
01:35:12.321 --> 01:35:15.340
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to end up be that guy that they didn't know that is like slurring</v>

3454
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:16.030
<v Speaker 1>a slow rise.</v>

3455
01:35:16.030 --> 01:35:17.840
<v Speaker 1>We've all seen those punchy guys in the gym,</v>

3456
01:35:17.841 --> 01:35:18.674
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3457
01:35:18.710 --> 01:35:21.880
<v Speaker 1>and those guys who are punching the gym and they start talking about finding it</v>

3458
01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:22.733
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

3459
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:24.380
<v Speaker 1>We've all seen those guys where they just,</v>

3460
01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:25.640
<v Speaker 1>they in their mind,</v>

3461
01:35:25.641 --> 01:35:26.474
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>

3462
01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:27.500
<v Speaker 1>just got to get in shape.</v>

3463
01:35:27.710 --> 01:35:28.490
<v Speaker 1>They still got it.</v>

3464
01:35:28.490 --> 01:35:30.000
<v Speaker 1>They can go back and do it again.</v>

3465
01:35:30.001 --> 01:35:30.560
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

3466
01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:31.550
<v Speaker 2>can you just want to tell him,</v>

3467
01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:32.773
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3468
01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:33.440
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

3469
01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:34.273
<v Speaker 2>you said,</v>

3470
01:35:35.140 --> 01:35:35.390
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3471
01:35:35.390 --> 01:35:38.270
<v Speaker 2>after getting knocked up once or twice,</v>

3472
01:35:38.330 --> 01:35:39.163
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3473
01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:41.120
<v Speaker 2>30 minutes later.</v>

3474
01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:44.780
<v Speaker 2>So I've been knocked out like two or three times also,</v>

3475
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:46.790
<v Speaker 2>but only one of them do.</v>

3476
01:35:46.791 --> 01:35:51.080
<v Speaker 2>I remember not remembering a big chunk of change.</v>

3477
01:35:51.410 --> 01:35:52.580
<v Speaker 2>So when I flat out,</v>

3478
01:35:53.780 --> 01:35:56.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember leaving the cage.</v>

3479
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:58.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember walking back.</v>

3480
01:35:58.610 --> 01:35:59.750
<v Speaker 2>I remember sitting there with,</v>

3481
01:35:59.751 --> 01:36:04.560
<v Speaker 2>with Tyron and somebody else in the doctor and I'm talking and I'm having it.</v>

3482
01:36:04.660 --> 01:36:09.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm literally saying something and then I realize my wife's in here and I'm Jai.</v>

3483
01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:13.990
<v Speaker 2>My consciousness comes back to me in the middle of while I'm speaking to Tyron,</v>

3484
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking to Tyron and I'm looking at my lung.</v>

3485
01:36:15.681 --> 01:36:16.880
<v Speaker 2>Why the hell is she back here?</v>

3486
01:36:17.180 --> 01:36:17.810
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3487
01:36:17.810 --> 01:36:18.650
<v Speaker 2>and then I ask him,</v>

3488
01:36:18.651 --> 01:36:19.280
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3489
01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:20.360
<v Speaker 2>he told me what happened.</v>

3490
01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:20.751
<v Speaker 2>And I was,</v>

3491
01:36:20.751 --> 01:36:21.680
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't believe it.</v>

3492
01:36:21.710 --> 01:36:22.160
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

3493
01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:24.620
<v Speaker 2>I didn't remember fighting any of that.</v>

3494
01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:27.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember any of that.</v>

3495
01:36:27.321 --> 01:36:28.970
<v Speaker 2>I just know what happened cause I watched the tape.</v>

3496
01:36:29.190 --> 01:36:31.830
<v Speaker 1>So to this day you don't have a functional memory?</v>

3497
01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:32.920
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3498
01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:34.570
<v Speaker 2>I saw a stitch that night and he was like,</v>

3499
01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:35.890
<v Speaker 2>we talked on your way back.</v>

3500
01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:37.090
<v Speaker 2>It's backstage.</v>

3501
01:36:37.210 --> 01:36:37.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

3502
01:36:37.690 --> 01:36:39.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember that conversation at all.</v>

3503
01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:40.511
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember seeing,</v>

3504
01:36:40.511 --> 01:36:41.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the walk</v>

3505
01:36:41.950 --> 01:36:43.740
<v Speaker 3>from the octagon back to the dock</v>

3506
01:36:45.370 --> 01:36:46.700
<v Speaker 3>two or three times I've been locked up,</v>

3507
01:36:46.710 --> 01:36:48.700
<v Speaker 3>maybe three times,</v>

3508
01:36:48.701 --> 01:36:49.690
<v Speaker 3>probably been knocked out.</v>

3509
01:36:49.780 --> 01:36:50.560
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

3510
01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:53.350
<v Speaker 3>it was just one time where that's ever happened at the exact same thing.</v>

3511
01:36:53.770 --> 01:36:54.850
<v Speaker 3>Was it the last one?</v>

3512
01:36:54.970 --> 01:36:55.420
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3513
01:36:55.420 --> 01:36:58.360
<v Speaker 3>it was my first one actually.</v>

3514
01:36:58.361 --> 01:36:59.830
<v Speaker 3>When a psycho one.</v>

3515
01:37:00.250 --> 01:37:02.440
<v Speaker 3>When I'm Simon.</v>

3516
01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:03.900
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3517
01:37:03.900 --> 01:37:04.733
<v Speaker 3>was it Simon?</v>

3518
01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:05.860
<v Speaker 3>I think it was Eddie Walker.</v>

3519
01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:07.570
<v Speaker 3>Did you go lion fight?</v>

3520
01:37:07.660 --> 01:37:08.080
<v Speaker 3>I got,</v>

3521
01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:11.830
<v Speaker 3>I was winning the entire fight and went for like one bass thing and got clipped</v>

3522
01:37:11.890 --> 01:37:12.723
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

3523
01:37:13.270 --> 01:37:13.840
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3524
01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:15.850
<v Speaker 3>they woke me up in the ring and I,</v>

3525
01:37:15.890 --> 01:37:16.870
<v Speaker 3>they walked me in backstage,</v>

3526
01:37:16.871 --> 01:37:18.610
<v Speaker 3>but I don't remember walking backstage.</v>

3527
01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:22.080
<v Speaker 3>And I remember La Scott can't the lion fight.</v>

01:37:50.601 --> 01:37:52.630
<v Speaker 1>And you tell him and then they ask you again about what happened.</v>

3548
01:37:52.670 --> 01:37:54.750
<v Speaker 1>You always see that with the guy in the back locked up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I can't interview guys after they got knocked out.</v>

3573
01:38:28.470 --> 01:38:29.251
<v Speaker 1>It's just not fair.</v>

3574
01:38:29.251 --> 01:38:30.084
<v Speaker 1>It's just not,</v>

3575

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3591
01:38:52.230 --> 01:38:53.760
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know if he was right or not.</v>

3592
01:38:53.780 --> 01:38:54.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3593
01:38:54.090 --> 01:38:54.631
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>

3594
01:38:54.631 --> 01:38:58.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you don't know what we're talking about after the fight over him got</v>

3595
01:38:58.171 --> 01:38:58.711
<v Speaker 1>knocked out,</v>

3596
01:38:58.711 --> 01:38:59.730
<v Speaker 1>knocked out pretty bad,</v>

3597
01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:00.241
<v Speaker 1>but he was,</v>

3598
01:39:00.241 --> 01:39:01.650
<v Speaker 1>it was a fight where there was moments.</v>

3599
01:39:01.651 --> 01:39:02.880
<v Speaker 1>We had his moments in the fight.</v>

3600
01:39:03.150 --> 01:39:03.481
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

3601
01:39:03.481 --> 01:39:03.721
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3602
01:39:03.721 --> 01:39:06.060
<v Speaker 1>he tags tpa had Steve Bay rocked.</v>

3603
01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:08.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was a crazy one round.</v>

3604
01:39:08.730 --> 01:39:10.950
<v Speaker 1>And after the fight he said,</v>

3605
01:39:10.951 --> 01:39:12.480
<v Speaker 1>you know that Steve Bay one,</v>

3606
01:39:12.481 --> 01:39:13.970
<v Speaker 1>but that he feels that,</v>

3607
01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:14.341
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3608
01:39:14.341 --> 01:39:14.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3609
01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Steve Bay tapped that.</v>

3610
01:39:15.991 --> 01:39:16.824
<v Speaker 1>He got ahold of the gear.</v>

3611
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:18.180
<v Speaker 1>Steve Bay tapped and I went,</v>

3612
01:39:18.181 --> 01:39:18.990
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

3613
01:39:18.990 --> 01:39:19.321
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3614
01:39:19.321 --> 01:39:21.720
<v Speaker 1>well let's take a look at it and we couldn't see it.</v>

3615
01:39:22.230 --> 01:39:23.041
<v Speaker 1>And then I said,</v>

3616
01:39:23.041 --> 01:39:24.300
<v Speaker 1>do you think it's at another angle?</v>

3617
01:39:24.330 --> 01:39:24.751
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

3618
01:39:24.751 --> 01:39:25.021
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

3619
01:39:25.021 --> 01:39:25.590
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

3620
01:39:25.590 --> 01:39:25.891
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3621
01:39:25.891 --> 01:39:26.581
<v Speaker 1>let's see it again.</v>

3622
01:39:26.581 --> 01:39:27.750
<v Speaker 1>So we showed it at different angles.</v>

3623
01:39:27.770 --> 01:39:28.860
<v Speaker 1>There was definitely no tap.</v>

3624
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:30.121
<v Speaker 1>And so then I'm like,</v>

3625
01:39:30.121 --> 01:39:30.960
<v Speaker 1>this poor dude,</v>

3626
01:39:31.230 --> 01:39:34.470

3627
01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:39.600

3628
01:39:39.601 --> 01:39:40.680
<v Speaker 1>But you can't,</v>

3629
01:39:41.130 --> 01:39:43.080
<v Speaker 1>you can't count on his memory right now.</v>

3630
01:39:43.530 --> 01:39:48.300
<v Speaker 1>He just got shut off and Al's just been shut off a ton of times.</v>

3631
01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:50.890
<v Speaker 1>He's lost in the UFC by knock out,</v>

3632
01:39:51.270 --> 01:39:53.220
<v Speaker 1>he's lost to Travis Browne by knockout.</v>

3633
01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:55.560
<v Speaker 1>He's lost to Ben.</v>

3634
01:39:55.620 --> 01:39:56.920
<v Speaker 1>Ben Rothwell by knockout.</v>

3635
01:39:56.970 --> 01:39:57.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

01:42:16.410 --> 01:42:17.850
<v Speaker 5>what is your 145 pounds?</v>

3735
01:42:18.270 --> 01:42:21.840
<v Speaker 5>This one is his first fight at one 45 but he was 55 and he's a,</v>

3736
01:42:21.870 --> 01:42:22.621
<v Speaker 5>he's a big fella.</v>

3737
01:42:22.621 --> 01:42:26.820
<v Speaker 5>He's probably what when he was probably walking around 180 pounds but he's</v>

3738
01:42:26.821 --> 01:42:27.510
<v Speaker 5>pretty short.</v>

3739
01:42:27.510 --> 01:42:28.051
<v Speaker 5>He's like five,</v>

3740
01:42:28.051 --> 01:42:28.531
<v Speaker 5>seven,</v>

3741
01:42:28.531 --> 01:42:28.801
<v Speaker 5>five,</v>

3742
01:42:28.801 --> 01:42:29.634
<v Speaker 5>six.</v>

3743
01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:30.780
<v Speaker 5>It looks real lean</v>

3744
01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:33.133
<v Speaker 6>right now.</v>

3745
01:42:34.970 --> 01:42:35.181
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3746
01:42:35.181 --> 01:42:37.740
<v Speaker 5>This is an interesting fight cause Varga,</v>

3747
01:42:37.810 --> 01:42:38.420
<v Speaker 5>like you said,</v>

3748
01:42:38.420 --> 01:42:41.720
<v Speaker 5>real technical and he's not like a real chance taker.</v>

3749
01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:42.613
<v Speaker 5>He fights,</v>

3750
01:42:42.830 --> 01:42:44.060
<v Speaker 5>he fights a smart fight.</v>

3751
01:42:45.050 --> 01:42:45.883
<v Speaker 6>Oh.</v>

3752
01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:48.650
<v Speaker 5>Whereas we're small and super aggressive</v>

3753
01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:51.620
<v Speaker 5>and he got,</v>

3754
01:42:51.620 --> 01:42:52.940
<v Speaker 5>the other factor is responding,</v>

3755
01:42:52.941 --> 01:42:56.990
<v Speaker 5>cutting this way to 45 and then also it being in Denver high altitude.</v>

3756
01:42:56.991 --> 01:42:58.070
<v Speaker 5>And you had a hard way cut,</v>

3757
01:42:58.160 --> 01:42:58.993
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3758
01:42:59.030 --> 01:42:59.863
<v Speaker 5>Interesting.</v>

3759
01:43:01.170 --> 01:43:02.660
<v Speaker 5>E five rounds.</v>

3760
01:43:02.661 --> 01:43:03.260
<v Speaker 5>The title fight.</v>

3761
01:43:03.260 --> 01:43:03.980
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3762
01:43:03.980 --> 01:43:04.181
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

3763
01:43:04.181 --> 01:43:05.510
<v Speaker 5>and then Vargas from Canada,</v>

3764
01:43:05.511 --> 01:43:07.990
<v Speaker 5>which I'm assuming is probably high altitude maybe,</v>

3765
01:43:10.750 --> 01:43:14.930
<v Speaker 5>but about my check on that Montreal is at sea level.</v>

3766
01:43:15.340 --> 01:43:20.340
<v Speaker 5>There's no fucking idea how the O'shea a a boat when he's lost the belt.</v>

3767
01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:25.653
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3768
01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:26.933
<v Speaker 6>didn't he?</v>

3769
01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:27.993
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

3770
01:43:28.210 --> 01:43:28.541
<v Speaker 6>I feel like,</v>

3771
01:43:28.541 --> 01:43:28.980
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>

3772
01:43:28.980 --> 01:43:30.320
<v Speaker 6>No I don't.</v>

3773
01:43:31.370 --> 01:43:31.560
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3774
01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:32.393
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

3775
01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:33.670
<v Speaker 5>I thought he lost it to the Adam.</v>

3776
01:43:33.671 --> 01:43:34.360
<v Speaker 5>Chuck D.</v>

3777
01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:35.193
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3778
01:43:35.380 --> 01:43:36.040
<v Speaker 5>glory.</v>

3779
01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:37.720
<v Speaker 5>If like they're in negotiations,</v>

3780
01:43:37.721 --> 01:43:38.471
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't go well.</v>

3781
01:43:38.471 --> 01:43:40.600
<v Speaker 5>They just fucking give your belt somebody else</v>

3782
01:43:43.090 --> 01:43:43.960
<v Speaker 5>that how it works.</v>

3783
01:43:44.650 --> 01:43:44.981
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3784
01:43:44.981 --> 01:43:45.820
<v Speaker 5>This shit ain't gone.</v>

3785
01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:47.530
<v Speaker 5>Shit ain't gone correct.</v>

3786
01:43:47.820 --> 01:43:48.653
<v Speaker 5>Amazing.</v>

3787
01:43:49.450 --> 01:43:49.691
<v Speaker 5>Big.</v>

3788
01:43:49.691 --> 01:43:50.650
<v Speaker 5>Very diplomatic.</v>

3789
01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:57.150
<v Speaker 5>You were talking about Melvin Joe and,</v>

3790
01:43:57.250 --> 01:43:59.780
<v Speaker 5>and that dude is an athlete,</v>

3791
01:43:59.781 --> 01:44:00.050
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3792
01:44:00.050 --> 01:44:00.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3793
01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:02.180
<v Speaker 5>When he was down in American top team,</v>

3794
01:44:02.510 --> 01:44:03.650
<v Speaker 5>I threw the football to him.</v>

3795
01:44:04.010 --> 01:44:06.650
<v Speaker 5>He threw a football back of me and the thing came back like a helicopter.</v>

3796
01:44:07.850 --> 01:44:08.020
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3797
01:44:08.020 --> 01:44:08.900
<v Speaker 5>he's from Holland.</v>

3798
01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:09.801
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

3799
01:44:09.801 --> 01:44:11.480
<v Speaker 5>They don't even know what a football is.</v>

3800
01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:16.250
<v Speaker 5>It was still weird whizzing back at you like a fucking yeah,</v>

3801
01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:17.780
<v Speaker 5>that was a stud.</v>

3802
01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:22.610
<v Speaker 5>Scary striker knocked out mark home a one punch man</v>

3803
01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:29.120
<v Speaker 5>in an MMA fight and he was outweighed by literally a hundred pounds.</v>

3804
01:44:29.890 --> 01:44:30.610
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3805
01:44:30.610 --> 01:44:31.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3806
01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:31.221
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3807
01:44:31.221 --> 01:44:35.300
<v Speaker 5>Mark Hunt was close to 300 pounds and Melvin was somewhere around 200 pounds,</v>

3808
01:44:35.630 --> 01:44:37.130
<v Speaker 5>probably less than 200 pounds.</v>

3809
01:44:37.131 --> 01:44:38.980
<v Speaker 5>He's always probably like one 91 eight,</v>

3810
01:44:38.981 --> 01:44:39.791
<v Speaker 5>five k OTE.</v>

3811
01:44:39.791 --> 01:44:40.624
<v Speaker 5>And what one shot.</v>

3812
01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:40.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3813
01:44:40.910 --> 01:44:43.440
<v Speaker 5>Melvin's probably one of my favorite fighters of all time like that.</v>

3814
01:44:43.490 --> 01:44:44.930
<v Speaker 5>But if there was a fight on TV,</v>

3815
01:44:44.931 --> 01:44:46.440
<v Speaker 5>like I'm always going to turn it on the moment,</v>

3816
01:44:46.450 --> 01:44:46.641
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3817
01:44:46.641 --> 01:44:47.000
<v Speaker 5>Off Fire.</v>

3818
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:47.930
<v Speaker 5>When you knocked him out,</v>

3819
01:44:47.931 --> 01:44:50.540
<v Speaker 5>was that a special victory for you because of that?</v>

3820
01:44:50.690 --> 01:44:50.961
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3821
01:44:50.961 --> 01:44:51.111
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3822
01:44:51.111 --> 01:44:52.490
<v Speaker 5>he was my first like big,</v>

3823
01:44:53.330 --> 01:44:53.841
<v Speaker 5>big name,</v>

3824
01:44:53.841 --> 01:44:54.920
<v Speaker 5>I guess for MMA.</v>

3825
01:44:54.940 --> 01:44:55.191
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3826
01:44:55.191 --> 01:44:56.480
<v Speaker 5>that was one of the big names.</v>

3827
01:44:56.540 --> 01:44:56.841
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

3828
01:44:56.841 --> 01:44:57.650
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3829
01:44:57.650 --> 01:44:57.921
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3830
01:44:57.921 --> 01:44:58.580
<v Speaker 5>it was a,</v>

3831
01:44:58.580 --> 01:45:01.730
<v Speaker 5>it was a guy that like I really looked up to and like really respected a lot</v>

3832
01:45:01.790 --> 01:45:02.051
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

3833
01:45:02.051 --> 01:45:02.884
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3834
01:45:03.130 --> 01:45:04.480
<v Speaker 5>it was like meant a lot to me that,</v>

3835
01:45:04.490 --> 01:45:05.690
<v Speaker 5>that I was even gonna fight him.</v>

3836
01:45:05.930 --> 01:45:09.140
<v Speaker 5>But I think that that also helped me stay motivated going into it that had so</v>

3837
01:45:09.141 --> 01:45:09.951
<v Speaker 5>much respect for him.</v>

3838
01:45:09.951 --> 01:45:10.360
<v Speaker 5>So he's,</v>

3839
01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:14.690
<v Speaker 5>my worst fights are guys that I don't think I look at him like I don't think</v>

3840
01:45:14.691 --> 01:45:15.380
<v Speaker 5>he's that good.</v>

3841
01:45:15.380 --> 01:45:16.650
<v Speaker 5>I don't mean to like take them widely,</v>

3842
01:45:16.670 --> 01:45:17.780
<v Speaker 5>but I just see them and I'm like,</v>

3843
01:45:17.810 --> 01:45:19.030
<v Speaker 5>this is not right.</v>

3844
01:45:19.210 --> 01:45:19.730
<v Speaker 5>Scary Guy,</v>

3845

<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3846
01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:21.170
<v Speaker 5>And that's like,</v>

3847
01:45:21.170 --> 01:45:23.170
<v Speaker 5>almost all my losses have been that way to me.</v>

01:47:15.860 --> 01:47:16.441
<v Speaker 5>That a yeah.</v>

3919
01:47:16.441 --> 01:47:17.670
<v Speaker 5>How many times you broke broken your feet?</v>

3920
01:47:18.140 --> 01:47:19.200
<v Speaker 5>I've broken all my toes,</v>

3921
01:47:19.201 --> 01:47:20.160
<v Speaker 5>like at least twice.</v>

3922
01:47:20.250 --> 01:47:21.083
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3923
01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:25.200
<v Speaker 5>I have a couple couple of wedge joints in my,</v>

3924
01:47:25.260 --> 01:47:25.830
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3925
01:47:25.830 --> 01:47:30.220
<v Speaker 5>on my right foot that a pretty regularly pop out of the socket after.</v>

3926
01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:33.900
<v Speaker 5>The worst is when the joints just don't come back.</v>

3927
01:47:33.901 --> 01:47:36.180
<v Speaker 5>They like a lot of the joints in the foot are kind of like this.</v>

3928
01:47:36.181 --> 01:47:37.200
<v Speaker 5>And then once you break them,</v>

3929
01:47:37.201 --> 01:47:38.580
<v Speaker 5>they go over top of each other.</v>

3930
01:47:39.230 --> 01:47:39.580
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3931
01:47:39.580 --> 01:47:41.520
<v Speaker 5>you went down again and kind of get that back in there.</v>

3932
01:47:43.830 --> 01:47:44.663
<v Speaker 6>Damn.</v>

3933
01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:47.550
<v Speaker 5>We're just moms on tear duties.</v>

3934
01:47:47.740 --> 01:47:50.440
<v Speaker 5>So much power and especially down at one 40,</v>

3935
01:47:50.740 --> 01:47:51.461
<v Speaker 5>one 43,</v>

3936
01:47:51.461 --> 01:47:52.294
<v Speaker 5>I guess.</v>

3937
01:47:52.450 --> 01:47:53.680
<v Speaker 5>What's the other glory rule?</v>

3938
01:47:53.681 --> 01:47:54.700
<v Speaker 5>Not the three knocked down,</v>

3939
01:47:54.701 --> 01:47:56.050
<v Speaker 5>but not in one round,</v>

3940
01:47:56.051 --> 01:47:56.440
<v Speaker 5>but in the,</v>

3941
01:47:56.440 --> 01:47:57.273
<v Speaker 5>in the whole fight.</v>

3942
01:47:57.570 --> 01:47:58.403
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3943
01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:00.370
<v Speaker 5>I think it's four knock downs in a fight.</v>

3944
01:48:00.371 --> 01:48:00.940
<v Speaker 5>Is that what it is?</v>

3945
01:48:00.940 --> 01:48:01.773
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3946

01:48:02.740 --> 01:48:03.573
<v Speaker 5>stunned them.</v>

3949
01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:05.380
<v Speaker 5>But that's a,</v>

3950
01:48:05.770 --> 01:48:08.520
<v Speaker 5>those are only for tournaments to those lousy.</v>

4011
01:49:54.950 --> 01:49:57.880
<v Speaker 5>Michael Jordan would need a big Mac before every big game.</v>

4017
01:50:11.231 --> 01:50:11.800

4023
01:50:17.230 --> 01:50:19.690
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4024
01:50:19.900 --> 01:50:20.920
<v Speaker 5>interesting.</v>

4025
01:50:20.950 --> 01:50:22.180
<v Speaker 5>Very interesting.</v>

4026
01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:23.980
<v Speaker 5>Steak and potatoes make sense?</v>

4027
01:50:25.330 --> 01:50:26.530
<v Speaker 5>It makes sense today,</v>

4028
01:50:27.430 --> 01:50:32.430
<v Speaker 5>but there's a lot of clips of a Floyd Mayweather eating cheese cheeseburgers and</v>

4029
01:50:33.401 --> 01:50:34.270
<v Speaker 5>drinking mountain dew,</v>

4030
01:50:34.300 --> 01:50:35.350
<v Speaker 5>like between the rounds.</v>

4031
01:50:35.530 --> 01:50:35.681
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4032
01:50:35.681 --> 01:50:39.510
<v Speaker 5>he apparently likes to drink soda like while he's fighting to replenish his</v>

4033
01:50:39.511 --> 01:50:40.420
<v Speaker 5>sugar or not.</v>

4034
01:50:40.421 --> 01:50:40.931
<v Speaker 5>When he's fighting,</v>

4035
01:50:40.931 --> 01:50:43.030
<v Speaker 5>while he's training to replenish your sugar.</v>

4036
01:50:43.031 --> 01:50:46.390
<v Speaker 5>Like he'll have a long workout and I'll drink a coke and then isn't he like the</v>

4037
01:50:46.391 --> 01:50:49.300
<v Speaker 5>only guy in Nevada that's allowed to drink Gatorade between rounds?</v>

4038
01:50:49.510 --> 01:50:51.520
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck?</v>

4039
01:50:51.530 --> 01:50:52.990
<v Speaker 5>They work that out and look it up.</v>

4040
01:50:54.590 --> 01:50:55.480
<v Speaker 5>Pull it up Jamie.</v>

4041
01:50:55.481 --> 01:50:56.380
<v Speaker 5>Not put look it up,</v>

4042
01:50:56.381 --> 01:50:56.681
<v Speaker 5>Jamie.</v>

4043
01:50:56.681 --> 01:50:57.860
<v Speaker 5>Is that really possible?</v>

4044
01:50:57.960 --> 01:50:59.790
<v Speaker 5>You like Gatorade came rounds,</v>

4045
01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:03.160
<v Speaker 5>talked about it like the one who the fuck has allowed to do this?</v>

4046
01:51:03.161 --> 01:51:03.371
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

4047
01:51:03.371 --> 01:51:04.360
<v Speaker 5>well it's Floyd Mayweather.</v>

4048
01:51:04.361 --> 01:51:05.081
<v Speaker 5>You can do what he wants.</v>

4049
01:51:05.081 --> 01:51:06.580
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't seem fair.</v>

4050
01:51:06.581 --> 01:51:07.414
<v Speaker 5>How could that be?</v>

4051
01:51:07.690 --> 01:51:09.760
<v Speaker 5>How is that possible when you undefeated,</v>

4052
01:51:09.761 --> 01:51:11.150
<v Speaker 5>why do I remember that though?</v>

4053
01:51:11.151 --> 01:51:13.260
<v Speaker 5>In Nevada you are,</v>

4054
01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:15.310
<v Speaker 5>you know the amount of money that he brings in,</v>

4055
01:51:15.390 --> 01:51:16.223
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4056
01:51:16.450 --> 01:51:17.170
<v Speaker 5>What does it say?</v>

4057
01:51:17.170 --> 01:51:18.003
<v Speaker 5>What does it say?</v>

4058
01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:19.720
<v Speaker 5>Roll it back there.</v>

4059
01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:23.440
<v Speaker 5>Vargas Vargas bear barred from drinking Gatorade.</v>

4060
01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:25.690
<v Speaker 5>Fernando San Fernando Vargas.</v>

4061
01:51:25.691 --> 01:51:26.524
<v Speaker 5>What years is</v>

4062
01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:30.190
<v Speaker 5>2006 damn.</v>

4063
01:51:30.191 --> 01:51:32.620
<v Speaker 5>Fernando Vargas was still fighting in 2006</v>

4064
01:51:34.210 --> 01:51:35.043
<v Speaker 5>interesting.</v>

4065
01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:38.170
<v Speaker 5>He was banned from drinking Gatorade in his corner between rounds a minute.</v>

4066
01:51:38.171 --> 01:51:38.500
<v Speaker 5>Wait,</v>

4067
01:51:38.500 --> 01:51:40.630
<v Speaker 5>rematch with against Shane Mosley.</v>

4068
01:51:41.500 --> 01:51:42.333
<v Speaker 5>Junior middleweight</v>

4069
01:51:43.870 --> 01:51:46.460
<v Speaker 5>pull up up gatoraid and Floyd.</v>

4070
01:51:46.540 --> 01:51:49.300
<v Speaker 5>Floyd Mayweather didn't come up.</v>

4071
01:51:50.380 --> 01:51:52.210
<v Speaker 5>Maybe a just showing just made that shit.</v>

4072
01:51:52.211 --> 01:51:53.680
<v Speaker 5>Oh no buddy.</v>

4073
01:51:55.630 --> 01:51:57.670
<v Speaker 5>Joe Chilean doesn't trust you're googling skills.</v>

4074
01:51:57.671 --> 01:51:58.870
<v Speaker 5>Jamie's on his phone.</v>

4075
01:51:59.950 --> 01:52:01.210
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to go to youtube.</v>

4076
01:52:01.211 --> 01:52:02.110
<v Speaker 5>I'll find the video.</v>

4077
01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:03.880
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if they got fact check,</v>

4078
01:52:03.881 --> 01:52:05.140

4080
01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:09.410

<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

4082
01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:14.440
<v Speaker 5>When that Vargas thing came up,</v>

4083
01:52:14.441 --> 01:52:15.940
<v Speaker 5>they reminded me of something I was,</v>

4084
01:52:16.070 --> 01:52:17.130
<v Speaker 5>I brought up to you earlier.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I think you will like this one.</v>

4088
01:52:25.420 --> 01:52:26.820
<v Speaker 5>MACACA versus Paley.</v>

4089
01:52:26.990 --> 01:52:28.330
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah man.</v>

4090

4094
01:52:36.791 --> 01:52:39.340
<v Speaker 5>And they fought in one of those rings with the ropes.</v>

4095
01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:41.110
<v Speaker 5>The net than the not of the bottom.</v>

4096
01:52:41.190 --> 01:52:41.741
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4097
01:52:41.741 --> 01:52:43.600
<v Speaker 5>I remember that shit yet with no gloves.</v>

4098
01:52:43.601 --> 01:52:44.434
<v Speaker 5>No gloves.</v>

4099

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4100
01:52:45.650 --> 01:52:46.340
<v Speaker 5>Old School.</v>

4101
01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:48.650
<v Speaker 1>Floyd Mayweather versus Manny Pacquiao.</v>

4102
01:52:49.460 --> 01:52:50.330
<v Speaker 1>Was it then?</v>

4103
01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:53.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4104
01:52:53.220 --> 01:52:55.050
<v Speaker 1>It was like a recent fight that I noticed it.</v>

4105
01:52:55.160 --> 01:52:56.880
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to read in between rounds?</v>

4106
01:52:56.881 --> 01:52:59.460
<v Speaker 1>Must be nice to own Nevada state athletic commission.</v>

4107
01:52:59.520 --> 01:52:59.821
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

01:53:05.221 --> 01:53:05.911
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

4115
01:53:05.911 --> 01:53:07.440
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck does he have Gatorade?</v>

4116
01:53:08.190 --> 01:53:09.023
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4117
01:53:10.280 --> 01:53:11.113
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:11.481
<v Speaker 1>We'll get that.</v>

4119
01:53:11.481 --> 01:53:13.310
<v Speaker 1>All those MMA fighters commenting.</v>

4120
01:53:13.311 --> 01:53:16.070
<v Speaker 1>Michael Page commented on a Floyd Mayweather fight.</v>

4121
01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:17.210
<v Speaker 1>Really interesting.</v>

4122
01:53:19.330 --> 01:53:22.450
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about this upcoming Kovalev Andre Ward fight.</v>

4123
01:53:24.490 --> 01:53:25.230
<v Speaker 1>Andre Ward.</v>

4124
01:53:25.230 --> 01:53:28.000
<v Speaker 1>Do you think so really those think Andre Ward's this.</v>

4125
01:53:28.330 --> 01:53:29.050
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a,</v>

4126
01:53:29.050 --> 01:53:30.010
<v Speaker 1>he's a bad mother fucker,</v>

4127
01:53:30.011 --> 01:53:31.330
<v Speaker 1>but Kovalev was a big guy.</v>

4128
01:53:31.380 --> 01:53:32.213
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4129
01:53:32.290 --> 01:53:32.920
<v Speaker 1>I just think he's,</v>

4130
01:53:32.920 --> 01:53:33.370
<v Speaker 1>he's just,</v>

4131
01:53:33.370 --> 01:53:34.870
<v Speaker 1>I think pound for pound is,</v>

4132
01:53:35.020 --> 01:53:35.170
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

4133
01:53:35.170 --> 01:53:38.470
<v Speaker 1>I think it's gotta be a Andre Ward.</v>

4134
01:53:39.820 --> 01:53:40.690
<v Speaker 1>He's just so smart.</v>

4135
01:53:41.530 --> 01:53:44.240
<v Speaker 1>These guys are going off Vargas.</v>

4136

4139
01:53:50.690 --> 01:53:51.870
<v Speaker 1>Floyd Mayweather and my team.</v>

4140
01:53:52.060 --> 01:53:54.760
<v Speaker 1>The money team might be the only corner I've ever seen a lot of drink Gatorade</v>

4141
01:53:54.761 --> 01:53:55.540
<v Speaker 1>during a fight.</v>

4142
01:53:55.540 --> 01:53:57.370
<v Speaker 1>Aljamain sterling and other MMA fighter.</v>

01:54:04.121 --> 01:54:04.954
<v Speaker 1>See all of us.</v>

4148
01:54:08.470 --> 01:54:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Mike Dolce,</v>

4149
01:54:09.550 --> 01:54:13.240
<v Speaker 1>can someone please explain why Floyd Mayweather can drink Gatorade during the</v>

4150
01:54:13.241 --> 01:54:14.680
<v Speaker 1>fight in Nevada state athletic commission.</v>

4151
01:54:14.710 --> 01:54:17.440
<v Speaker 1>Friends suspend us for anything but unsealed water.</v>

4152
01:54:17.860 --> 01:54:18.693
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

4153
01:54:19.450 --> 01:54:20.283
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

4154
01:54:20.590 --> 01:54:21.423
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

4155
01:54:21.590 --> 01:54:22.810
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what that was about.</v>

4156
01:54:24.190 --> 01:54:25.001
<v Speaker 1>They're just so happy.</v>

4157
01:54:25.001 --> 01:54:26.140
<v Speaker 1>He was making them so much money.</v>

4158
01:54:26.650 --> 01:54:27.610
<v Speaker 1>So much money.</v>

4159
01:54:28.180 --> 01:54:30.880
<v Speaker 1>Just such a smart guy in terms of like,</v>

4160
01:54:30.881 --> 01:54:35.230
<v Speaker 1>his style was never the kind of style that would make a bunch of people come out</v>

4161
01:54:35.231 --> 01:54:36.064
<v Speaker 1>to see him fight.</v>

4162
01:54:36.430 --> 01:54:40.330
<v Speaker 1>But all that shit talking made all those people want to come see him lose.</v>

4163
01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:41.920
<v Speaker 1>It's weird though because some,</v>

4164
01:54:41.980 --> 01:54:43.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean some of his fights,</v>

4165
01:54:43.091 --> 01:54:44.860
<v Speaker 1>you see his offense.</v>

4166
01:54:45.300 --> 01:54:46.750

<v Speaker 1>Kodo,</v>

4168
01:54:47.771 --> 01:54:49.300

4169
01:54:50.050 --> 01:54:52.020
<v Speaker 1>Judah authorities.</v>

4170
01:54:52.450 --> 01:54:53.920
<v Speaker 1>But that was the weird one.</v>

4171
01:54:54.370 --> 01:54:55.450
<v Speaker 1>Angel enough.</v>

4172
01:54:56.050 --> 01:54:57.340
<v Speaker 1>Freddy Not Angel Bedford.</v>

4173
01:54:58.120 --> 01:54:58.953

01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:01.593
<v Speaker 1>Freddo</v>

4179
01:55:07.631 --> 01:55:08.870
<v Speaker 1>That is fucking crazy.</v>

4180
01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:09.753
<v Speaker 1>Gatorade.</v>

4181
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.340
<v Speaker 1>They are opening up a Goddamn Gatorade.</v>

4182
01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:13.833
<v Speaker 1>It's a purple drink.</v>

4183
01:55:14.550 --> 01:55:15.383
<v Speaker 1>Just the perpetrator.</v>

4184
01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:18.260
<v Speaker 1>That is crazy.</v>

4185
01:55:18.261 --> 01:55:19.810
<v Speaker 1>His dad's giving him Gatorade.</v>

4186
01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:21.820
<v Speaker 1>That's so illegal.</v>

4187
01:55:22.870 --> 01:55:23.770
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4188
01:55:23.771 --> 01:55:25.900
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck did they get away with that?</v>

4189
01:55:26.740 --> 01:55:27.700
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

4190
01:55:28.060 --> 01:55:29.140
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

4191
01:55:30.550 --> 01:55:31.361
<v Speaker 1>That's in Panama.</v>

4192
01:55:31.361 --> 01:55:32.170
<v Speaker 1>Louis Shit.</v>

4193
01:55:32.170 --> 01:55:33.960
<v Speaker 1>I was just thinking of that was trying to think of my high school.</v>

4194
01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:35.800
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the gimme the other bottle.</v>

4195
01:55:36.070 --> 01:55:36.371
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4196
01:55:36.371 --> 01:55:37.900
<v Speaker 1>the one I may want a mixed.</v>

4197
01:55:40.580 --> 01:55:44.130
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden he's Aaron Pryor and Alexis Arguayo</v>

4198
01:55:44.950 --> 01:55:47.220
<v Speaker 11>loose from Holland with a nasty left hook to the body there.</v>

4199
01:55:47.310 --> 01:55:48.070
<v Speaker 11>Oh Shit.</v>

4200
01:55:48.070 --> 01:55:48.903
<v Speaker 11>Nothing upper cut.</v>

4201
01:55:49.230 --> 01:55:51.500
<v Speaker 11>When I first joined Att Panama Lewis was,</v>

4202
01:55:51.570 --> 01:55:52.460
<v Speaker 11>was in there sometimes.</v>

4203
01:55:53.470 --> 01:55:55.050
<v Speaker 11>Was that like being next to the devil</v>

4204
01:55:57.060 --> 01:55:59.180
<v Speaker 11>because people don't remember that Billy Costello fight.</v>

4205
01:55:59.190 --> 01:56:00.060
<v Speaker 11>Do you remember that fight?</v>

4206
01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:01.853
<v Speaker 11>No.</v>

4207
01:56:01.980 --> 01:56:02.490
<v Speaker 11>Um,</v>

4208
01:56:02.490 --> 01:56:05.400
<v Speaker 11>Louie Resto was a fighter who fought this kid,</v>

4209
01:56:05.490 --> 01:56:07.350
<v Speaker 11>I think his name is Billy Castelle Junior.</v>

4210
01:56:07.770 --> 01:56:08.191
<v Speaker 11>And uh,</v>

4211
01:56:08.191 --> 01:56:12.540
<v Speaker 11>he was a real promising up and coming fighter and Louie Resto was a good boxer,</v>

4212
01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:16.050
<v Speaker 11>but not like a knockout box or where it's Collins was a big knockout boxer.</v>

4213
01:56:16.410 --> 01:56:17.040
<v Speaker 11>So,</v>

4214
01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:17.430
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>

4215
01:56:17.430 --> 01:56:19.680
<v Speaker 11>Louie Resto beats the shit out of college.</v>

4216
01:56:19.681 --> 01:56:21.050
<v Speaker 11>When he took the stuff out of the glass,</v>

4217
01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:24.900
<v Speaker 11>Dad grabbed the glove and felt it.</v>

4218
01:56:24.901 --> 01:56:25.734
<v Speaker 11>The Guy,</v>

4219
01:56:25.770 --> 01:56:30.330
<v Speaker 11>the dad suspected it and after the fight he grabbed a hold of wrestles gloves</v>

4220
01:56:30.331 --> 01:56:33.420
<v Speaker 11>and rest pulled away and there was no stuffing in the glove.</v>

4221
01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:34.140
<v Speaker 11>He had,</v>

4222
01:56:34.140 --> 01:56:37.770
<v Speaker 11>it's just basically at hand wraps on and just bare knuckle beat the shit out of</v>

4223
01:56:37.771 --> 01:56:42.450
<v Speaker 11>him and it fucked Collins up so bad that Collins his eyes,</v>

4224
01:56:42.451 --> 01:56:46.620
<v Speaker 11>he lost his vision and he lost his ability to fight.</v>

4225
01:56:46.830 --> 01:56:51.600
<v Speaker 11>And so after that fight he became a raging alcoholic and wound up committing</v>

4226
01:56:51.601 --> 01:56:52.410
<v Speaker 11>suicide.</v>

4227
01:56:52.410 --> 01:56:53.400
<v Speaker 11>Drove into a tree.</v>

4228
01:56:53.610 --> 01:56:54.301
<v Speaker 11>I remember that.</v>

4229
01:56:54.301 --> 01:56:55.410
<v Speaker 11>I saw that documentary.</v>

4230
01:56:55.420 --> 01:56:56.253
<v Speaker 11>It was a really good goodness.</v>

4231
01:56:56.670 --> 01:56:59.370
<v Speaker 11>Water and electrolyte drinks are allowed in the corner.</v>

4232
01:56:59.371 --> 01:57:04.371
<v Speaker 11>Any electrolyte drink must be brought to the arena in the factory sealed plastic</v>

4233
01:57:04.501 --> 01:57:05.334
<v Speaker 11>bottles.</v>

4234
01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:06.121
<v Speaker 11>Moreover,</v>

4235
01:57:06.121 --> 01:57:09.660
<v Speaker 11>a contestant must provide the commission and its staff with any information</v>

4236
01:57:09.661 --> 01:57:13.230
<v Speaker 11>about the request to drink in sufficient time to make a determination as to</v>

4237
01:57:13.231 --> 01:57:14.490
<v Speaker 11>whether to drink is approvable.</v>

4238
01:57:15.060 --> 01:57:15.751
<v Speaker 11>Example,</v>

4239
01:57:15.751 --> 01:57:16.620

4242
01:57:18.601 --> 01:57:19.081

<v Speaker 11>Huh?</v>

4251
01:57:28.530 --> 01:57:29.970
<v Speaker 11>Unless you're an MMA fighter,</v>

4252
01:57:30.660 --> 01:57:31.493
<v Speaker 11>is that true?</v>

4253
01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:32.550
<v Speaker 11>I mean,</v>

4254
01:57:32.610 --> 01:57:33.300
<v Speaker 11>is that what it is?</v>

4255
01:57:33.300 --> 01:57:36.390
<v Speaker 11>Isn't the boxing specific boxing dot NV dot.</v>

<v Speaker 11>Co does boxing you have um,</v>

01:57:38.790 --> 01:57:39.623
<v Speaker 11>Is that Nevada?</v>

4259
01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:42.240
<v Speaker 11>So boxing has different rules.</v>

4260
01:57:42.390 --> 01:57:43.223
<v Speaker 11>Is that what it is?</v>

4261
01:57:45.340 --> 01:57:46.173
<v Speaker 11>What are you looking for brother?</v>

01:57:49.110 --> 01:57:49.891
<v Speaker 11>Is that possible?</v>

4264
01:57:49.891 --> 01:57:51.450
<v Speaker 11>That boxing has different rules?</v>

4265
01:57:51.900 --> 01:57:54.030
<v Speaker 11>Do you want a real joint instead of that dirty roach?</v>

01:58:11.390 --> 01:58:12.770
<v Speaker 5>I thought it didn't go into the fifth,</v>

4282
01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:13.670
<v Speaker 5>but I don't remember.</v>

4369
02:00:54.770 --> 02:00:55.850
<v Speaker 2>Jamaican to me.</v>

4370
02:00:56.120 --> 02:00:57.380
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea.</v>

4371
02:00:58.070 --> 02:01:00.030
<v Speaker 2>Not as a lot of Bahamians and Canada.</v>

4372
02:01:00.190 --> 02:01:01.130
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

4373
02:01:01.220 --> 02:01:03.260
<v Speaker 2>So the Commonwealth nations,</v>

4374
02:01:03.890 --> 02:01:06.680
<v Speaker 2>The Bahamas is a Commonwealth nation and most of the Caribbean is,</v>

4375
02:01:07.430 --> 02:01:09.560
<v Speaker 2>but I can move to Canada right now.</v>

4376
02:01:09.860 --> 02:01:10.101
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4377
02:01:10.101 --> 02:01:10.730
<v Speaker 2>that's cool.</v>

4378
02:01:10.730 --> 02:01:11.300
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4379
02:01:11.300 --> 02:01:11.720
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

4380
02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:12.230
<v Speaker 2>I can move to,</v>

4381
02:01:12.230 --> 02:01:12.470
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>

4382
02:01:12.470 --> 02:01:14.410
<v Speaker 2>I can live there for a long time without,</v>

4383
02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:17.900
<v Speaker 2>I still would have to get citizenship or get paperwork done.</v>

4384
02:01:18.380 --> 02:01:21.080
<v Speaker 2>But like when the UFC goes to Canada and everybody has to get a visa,</v>

4385
02:01:21.081 --> 02:01:21.621
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

4386
02:01:21.621 --> 02:01:22.454
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to do that.</v>

4387
02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:23.473
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>

4388
02:01:24.350 --> 02:01:25.183
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

4389
02:01:25.370 --> 02:01:26.510
<v Speaker 2>I can just go there and work.</v>

4390
02:01:26.690 --> 02:01:27.523
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

4391
02:01:28.730 --> 02:01:29.540
<v Speaker 2>But do you have units?</v>

4392
02:01:29.540 --> 02:01:30.440
<v Speaker 2>US citizenship.</v>

4393

<v Speaker 2>You have a green card?</v>

4394
02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:33.393
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4395
02:01:33.530 --> 02:01:35.510
<v Speaker 2>So they can kick you out of America if you don't like,</v>

4396
02:01:35.511 --> 02:01:37.400
<v Speaker 2>if you talk shit about Donald Trump or something like that.</v>

4397
02:01:37.670 --> 02:01:37.821
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4398
02:01:37.821 --> 02:01:38.654
<v Speaker 2>they could</v>

4399
02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:43.190
<v Speaker 1>get out of our country.</v>

4400
02:01:43.191 --> 02:01:44.660
<v Speaker 1>You don't like our new king?</v>

4401
02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:48.350
<v Speaker 1>He's pretty fucking close to being the new tank too.</v>

4402
02:01:48.351 --> 02:01:48.831
<v Speaker 1>That's so,</v>

4403
02:01:48.831 --> 02:01:49.664
<v Speaker 1>so scary.</v>

4404

02:02:20.151 --> 02:02:20.631
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump.</v>

4422
02:02:20.631 --> 02:02:21.710
<v Speaker 1>He's not like Donald Trump.</v>

4423
02:02:21.711 --> 02:02:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

4424
02:02:22.490 --> 02:02:27.440

4425
02:02:27.441 --> 02:02:28.250
<v Speaker 1>establishment.</v>

4426
02:02:28.250 --> 02:02:28.820
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4427
02:02:28.820 --> 02:02:29.490

4428
02:02:29.490 --> 02:02:30.323
<v Speaker 1>that's the way to go.</v>

4429
02:02:31.010 --> 02:02:32.300
<v Speaker 1>It's hard not to feel that way.</v>

4430
02:02:32.330 --> 02:02:32.631
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4431
02:02:32.631 --> 02:02:35.930
<v Speaker 1>although I think I'm just going to write in Bernie to be honest with you.</v>

4432
02:02:37.250 --> 02:02:37.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4433
02:02:37.551 --> 02:02:38.171
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm,</v>

4434
02:02:38.171 --> 02:02:39.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if it's going to count,</v>

4435
02:02:39.171 --> 02:02:40.640
<v Speaker 1>but I was still rather write in Bernie.</v>

4436
02:02:41.150 --> 02:02:43.670
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to my friends about this and it's because</v>

4437
02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:45.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

4438
02:02:45.740 --> 02:02:47.360
<v Speaker 1>I fucking hate both of them,</v>

4439
02:02:47.450 --> 02:02:49.250
<v Speaker 1>but I can't figure out which one I hate more.</v>

4440
02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:50.600
<v Speaker 1>And if I did fera which one?</v>

4441
02:02:50.620 --> 02:02:51.200
<v Speaker 1>Eight or more.</v>

4442
02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:52.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't trust that one.</v>

4443
02:02:52.401 --> 02:02:54.530
<v Speaker 1>Not to make me regret voting for them either way.</v>

4444
02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:54.880
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4445
02:02:54.880 --> 02:02:55.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4446
02:02:55.680 --> 02:02:56.780
<v Speaker 1>I think you're screwed either way.</v>

4447
02:02:57.050 --> 02:02:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4448
02:02:57.410 --> 02:02:59.840
<v Speaker 1>it's such a problem having someone,</v>

4449
02:03:00.290 --> 02:03:01.220
<v Speaker 1>either one of them,</v>

4450
02:03:01.221 --> 02:03:01.490
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

4451
02:03:01.490 --> 02:03:02.360
<v Speaker 1>It is a problem,</v>

4452
02:03:02.361 --> 02:03:07.040
<v Speaker 1>but it's a problem having someone who is outside of the system,</v>

4453
02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:10.460
<v Speaker 1>they'd have to step inside of the system and try to figure out how to make</v>

4454
02:03:10.461 --> 02:03:11.294
<v Speaker 1>things happen.</v>

4455
02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Like I wonder how much,</v>

4456
02:03:13.460 --> 02:03:15.470
<v Speaker 1>it would be interesting to see if Donald Trump won,</v>

4457
02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:20.560
<v Speaker 1>just based on what happens when someone's a complete political outsider and they</v>

4458
02:03:20.811 --> 02:03:22.700
<v Speaker 1>get to a position where they're running for president.</v>

4459
02:03:22.700 --> 02:03:24.230
<v Speaker 1>Like Obama was an insider.</v>

4460
02:03:24.530 --> 02:03:26.810
<v Speaker 1>He had already been deeply entrenched in the system.</v>

4461
02:03:26.811 --> 02:03:28.460
<v Speaker 1>Hillary's obviously an insider.</v>

4462
02:03:28.940 --> 02:03:30.320
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck would have happened,</v>

4463
02:03:30.630 --> 02:03:31.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4464
02:03:31.050 --> 02:03:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders got in.</v>

4465
02:03:32.590 --> 02:03:32.951
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

4466
02:03:32.951 --> 02:03:37.430
<v Speaker 1>what would happen if Donald Trump gets in if someone who's really pretty</v>

4467
02:03:37.431 --> 02:03:38.264
<v Speaker 1>independent,</v>

4468
02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:39.553
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

4469
02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:40.701
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4470
02:03:40.701 --> 02:03:41.050
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4471
02:03:41.050 --> 02:03:44.350
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things you have no idea because it's,</v>

4472
02:03:44.430 --> 02:03:46.580
<v Speaker 1>is the Senate and the congress going to stand behind them</v>

4473
02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:49.970
<v Speaker 1>also be able to pass laws.</v>

4474
02:03:50.030 --> 02:03:51.200
<v Speaker 1>Trump says crazy shit.</v>

4475
02:03:51.860 --> 02:03:52.460
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

4476
02:03:52.460 --> 02:03:52.881
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

4477
02:03:52.881 --> 02:03:56.480
<v Speaker 1>he says so much shit about like what he would do if like he was president and</v>

4478
02:03:56.481 --> 02:03:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Hillary be in jail.</v>

4479
02:03:57.411 --> 02:03:58.500
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like you can't,</v>

4480
02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:01.520
<v Speaker 1>like you're not the law.</v>

4481
02:04:01.550 --> 02:04:03.470
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't just lock her up man.</v>

4482
02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:06.560
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a reason why we have this whole system in place.</v>

4483
02:04:06.561 --> 02:04:09.230
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't just circumvent that and now that you're the king,</v>

4484
02:04:09.380 --> 02:04:10.970
<v Speaker 1>like it doesn't give you ultimate power.</v>

4485
02:04:10.970 --> 02:04:15.970
<v Speaker 1>But his perception of it or the way he talks about it is that if he got in he</v>

4486
02:04:16.131 --> 02:04:19.360
<v Speaker 1>would have that ultimate power since disturbance.</v>

4487
02:04:19.390 --> 02:04:24.290
<v Speaker 1>It is disturbing but it's more disturbing to me because you see guys like Rudy</v>

4488
02:04:24.290 --> 02:04:27.290
<v Speaker 1>Giuliani and he supported this bill to get people that are on the terrorist</v>

4489
02:04:27.291 --> 02:04:29.690
<v Speaker 1>watch list to have to wear ankle bracelets.</v>

4490
02:04:30.110 --> 02:04:30.680
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

4491
02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:32.720
<v Speaker 1>so you didn't commit a crime,</v>

4492
02:04:32.750 --> 02:04:34.190
<v Speaker 1>you're just on a watch list,</v>

4493
02:04:34.490 --> 02:04:36.530
<v Speaker 1>but you are being treated like prisoner.</v>

4494
02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:39.180
<v Speaker 1>Rudy Giuliani is was trying,</v>

4495
02:04:39.181 --> 02:04:40.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he's still,</v>

4496
02:04:40.171 --> 02:04:42.060
<v Speaker 1>if that bill is still trying to push forward,</v>

4497
02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:45.930
<v Speaker 1>but Rudy Giuliani was trying to push this thing forward a couple of months ago.</v>

4498
02:04:46.020 --> 02:04:50.570
<v Speaker 1>What exactly is the fucking terrorist watch list and like how crazy is,</v>

4499
02:04:50.590 --> 02:04:54.390
<v Speaker 1>they have a list and you're on the list,</v>

4500
02:04:54.540 --> 02:04:56.040
<v Speaker 1>but you're not totally a criminal,</v>

4501
02:04:56.041 --> 02:04:58.080
<v Speaker 1>but we think he might be a fucking criminal.</v>

4502
02:04:58.320 --> 02:04:59.153
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to put up,</v>

4503
02:04:59.170 --> 02:05:00.180
<v Speaker 1>we're going to write you down.</v>

4504
02:05:00.180 --> 02:05:03.960
<v Speaker 1>You're on the naughty list and San is not happy with you.</v>

4505
02:05:05.540 --> 02:05:09.570
<v Speaker 1>You kick off a plane and you're going to get out on the fucking terrorist watch</v>

4506
02:05:09.571 --> 02:05:10.620
<v Speaker 1>list or you can,</v>

4507
02:05:10.630 --> 02:05:10.910
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

4508
02:05:10.910 --> 02:05:11.341
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

4509
02:05:11.341 --> 02:05:15.330
<v Speaker 1>if you go and you look at the terrorist watch lists and you read the names that</v>

4510
02:05:15.331 --> 02:05:16.140
<v Speaker 1>are on there,</v>

4511
02:05:16.140 --> 02:05:17.220
<v Speaker 1>by the time you get to the end,</v>

4512
02:05:17.221 --> 02:05:18.300
<v Speaker 1>your name should be on there.</v>

4513
02:05:18.960 --> 02:05:19.260
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

4514
02:05:19.260 --> 02:05:19.561
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

4515
02:05:19.561 --> 02:05:19.861
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

4516
02:05:19.861 --> 02:05:20.191
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

4517
02:05:20.191 --> 02:05:21.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's how they'd work.</v>

4518
02:05:21.791 --> 02:05:23.880
<v Speaker 1>The is why anybody can be on there.</v>

4519
02:05:24.060 --> 02:05:25.650
<v Speaker 1>Well there's probably a while it was on there.</v>

4520
02:05:25.690 --> 02:05:26.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4521
02:05:26.450 --> 02:05:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4522
02:05:27.090 --> 02:05:28.500
<v Speaker 1>because his name is Mohammed Law.</v>

4523
02:05:28.610 --> 02:05:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4524
02:05:29.340 --> 02:05:30.173
<v Speaker 1>King Mo.</v>

4525
02:05:31.380 --> 02:05:32.213
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4526
02:05:32.460 --> 02:05:33.430
<v Speaker 1>Well there was a,</v>

4527
02:05:33.431 --> 02:05:37.620
<v Speaker 1>a woman I believe who was our Green Party candidate who was on the terrorist</v>

4528
02:05:37.621 --> 02:05:40.590
<v Speaker 1>watch list or at least she was on the no fly list.</v>

4529
02:05:41.400 --> 02:05:41.851
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4530
02:05:41.851 --> 02:05:42.270
<v Speaker 1>the don't,</v>

4531
02:05:42.270 --> 02:05:43.740
<v Speaker 1>the no fly list is funky.</v>

4532
02:05:43.741 --> 02:05:45.840
<v Speaker 1>Like they just put you on the no fly list.</v>

4533
02:05:46.350 --> 02:05:46.531
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4534
02:05:46.531 --> 02:05:47.490
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

4535
02:05:47.550 --> 02:05:48.383
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

4536
02:05:48.690 --> 02:05:49.830
<v Speaker 1>I can't fly,</v>

4537
02:05:50.310 --> 02:05:51.390
<v Speaker 1>but I can take buses.</v>

4538
02:05:52.440 --> 02:05:54.420
<v Speaker 1>What can I get on a train?</v>

4539
02:05:54.930 --> 02:05:57.030
<v Speaker 1>What about about can I get on a boat?</v>

4540
02:05:57.150 --> 02:05:58.080
<v Speaker 1>Can I find myself?</v>

4541
02:05:58.110 --> 02:05:59.280
<v Speaker 1>Can I go out in public?</v>

4542
02:05:59.340 --> 02:05:59.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4543
02:05:59.820 --> 02:06:02.130
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is that a no fly list?</v>

4544
02:06:02.460 --> 02:06:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Hold on man.</v>

4545
02:06:03.720 --> 02:06:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're not going to arrest someone for something,</v>

4546
02:06:06.180 --> 02:06:09.000
<v Speaker 1>like how the fuck can you keep them from going places?</v>

4547
02:06:09.240 --> 02:06:10.890
<v Speaker 1>You can keep him from flying.</v>

4548
02:06:12.540 --> 02:06:13.670
<v Speaker 1>That seems so is it.</v>

4549
02:06:13.671 --> 02:06:14.031
<v Speaker 1>Hears it.</v>

4550
02:06:14.031 --> 02:06:16.740
<v Speaker 1>You can't fly because we are afraid you're not going to come back or like you're</v>

4551
02:06:16.741 --> 02:06:19.610
<v Speaker 1>like a no blame when they're on it.</v>

4552
02:06:19.720 --> 02:06:20.553
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4553
02:06:20.600 --> 02:06:23.160
<v Speaker 1>Well planes are connected to terror,</v>

4554
02:06:23.161 --> 02:06:23.550
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4555
02:06:23.550 --> 02:06:26.790
<v Speaker 1>Especially now because of nine 11 yup.</v>

4556
02:06:27.180 --> 02:06:27.571
<v Speaker 1>They're just,</v>

4557
02:06:27.571 --> 02:06:29.440
<v Speaker 1>you can't break them away from terrorists,</v>

4558
02:06:29.441 --> 02:06:30.360
<v Speaker 1>planes and terror.</v>

4559
02:06:30.361 --> 02:06:31.380
<v Speaker 1>They go hand in hand.</v>

4560
02:06:31.900 --> 02:06:34.200
<v Speaker 1>One of the ways to stop live stream has ended.</v>

4561
02:06:34.201 --> 02:06:35.310
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for watching.</v>

4562
02:06:36.070 --> 02:06:36.903

4563
02:06:37.060 --> 02:06:39.700
<v Speaker 12>How's that possible main events,</v>

4564
02:06:39.820 --> 02:06:41.800
<v Speaker 12>but just start at uh,</v>

4565
02:06:41.830 --> 02:06:43.750
<v Speaker 12>six and 15 minutes.</v>

4566
02:06:43.980 --> 02:06:44.610

<v Speaker 1>that was at the prelims.</v>

4569
02:06:49.351 --> 02:06:49.560
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4570
02:06:49.560 --> 02:06:50.610
<v Speaker 12>It's like a super fight series.</v>

4571
02:06:50.611 --> 02:06:51.444
<v Speaker 12>What they called it.</v>

4572
02:06:51.480 --> 02:06:51.631
<v Speaker 12>Oh,</v>

4573
02:06:51.631 --> 02:06:54.510
<v Speaker 12>so there's another thing for four more fights I think.</v>

4574
02:06:54.540 --> 02:06:55.530
<v Speaker 12>Oh my goodness.</v>

4575
02:06:56.190 --> 02:06:56.551
<v Speaker 12>I know.</v>

4576
02:06:56.551 --> 02:06:57.210
<v Speaker 12>I was like,</v>

4577
02:06:57.210 --> 02:06:59.250
<v Speaker 12>I game broadcast on ESPN three,</v>

4578
02:06:59.251 --> 02:07:00.480
<v Speaker 12>which is like the Internet thing.</v>

4579
02:07:00.570 --> 02:07:02.400
<v Speaker 12>So can we watch this on here too?</v>

4580
02:07:02.401 --> 02:07:02.870
<v Speaker 12>It should be.</v>

4581
02:07:02.870 --> 02:07:03.703
<v Speaker 12>I'm pretty sure.</v>

4582
02:07:04.470 --> 02:07:05.101
<v Speaker 12>Oh No,</v>

4583
02:07:05.101 --> 02:07:06.120
<v Speaker 12>I bet it'd be on here.</v>

4584
02:07:06.590 --> 02:07:07.580
<v Speaker 4>We still got 10 minutes,</v>

4586
02:07:12.220 --> 02:07:14.230
<v Speaker 12>we can get their web,</v>

4587
02:07:14.350 --> 02:07:15.760
<v Speaker 12>their web thinks if you have ESPN,</v>

4588
02:07:15.761 --> 02:07:17.230
<v Speaker 12>you can just get it on online.</v>

4589
02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:18.153
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 12>Thanks for bringing that up.</v>

4593
02:07:27.010 --> 02:07:27.431
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4594
02:07:27.431 --> 02:07:31.390
<v Speaker 1>It says Varga versus then rue Smolen but it doesn't say,</v>

4595
02:07:34.280 --> 02:07:35.650
<v Speaker 13>it doesn't say anything else.</v>

4596
02:07:35.750 --> 02:07:36.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

4597
02:07:36.360 --> 02:07:37.160
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

4598
02:07:37.160 --> 02:07:39.050
<v Speaker 12>Main event is on ESPN three.</v>

4599
02:07:39.140 --> 02:07:39.710
<v Speaker 13>Okay.</v>

4600
02:07:39.710 --> 02:07:40.670
<v Speaker 13>How do we do that?</v>

4601
02:07:40.700 --> 02:07:41.533
<v Speaker 13>Can you do that?</v>

4602
02:07:43.740 --> 02:07:44.760
<v Speaker 12>Can you do that for us?</v>

4603
02:07:44.790 --> 02:07:45.720
<v Speaker 12>Yeah,</v>

4604
02:07:45.740 --> 02:07:46.573
<v Speaker 12>I think so.</v>

4605
02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:47.633
<v Speaker 12>Beautiful.</v>

4606
02:07:48.530 --> 02:07:48.801
<v Speaker 13>Oh,</v>

4607
02:07:48.801 --> 02:07:49.850
<v Speaker 13>that's interesting man.</v>

4608
02:07:49.851 --> 02:07:52.640
<v Speaker 13>So essentially it's just like the UFC.</v>

4609
02:07:52.760 --> 02:07:54.120
<v Speaker 13>The UFC has those uh,</v>

4610
02:07:56.400 --> 02:07:56.810
<v Speaker 13>uh,</v>

4611
02:07:56.810 --> 02:08:01.810
<v Speaker 13>fs one and reclaimed pass ones and they have the fs one fights just like that.</v>

4612
02:08:02.150 --> 02:08:03.260
<v Speaker 13>So it's just the prelims.</v>

4613
02:08:03.650 --> 02:08:04.670
<v Speaker 12>Let me see that.</v>

4614
02:08:08.650 --> 02:08:09.221
<v Speaker 13>Oh boy.</v>

4615
02:08:09.221 --> 02:08:10.300
<v Speaker 13>Young Jarem.</v>

4616
02:08:10.350 --> 02:08:11.830
<v Speaker 13>He's going to sort it.</v>

4617
02:08:11.860 --> 02:08:12.730
<v Speaker 13>Oh,</v>

4618
02:08:13.180 --> 02:08:13.690
<v Speaker 13>Eve Edwards.</v>

4619
02:08:13.690 --> 02:08:15.040
<v Speaker 13>You're really good analyst.</v>

4620
02:08:15.130 --> 02:08:15.851
<v Speaker 13>I just want to tell you,</v>

4621
02:08:15.851 --> 02:08:18.100
<v Speaker 13>I really enjoy your analysis.</v>

4622
02:08:18.220 --> 02:08:19.360
<v Speaker 13>Your grade on the mic,</v>

4623
02:08:19.630 --> 02:08:20.111
<v Speaker 13>your,</v>

4624
02:08:20.111 --> 02:08:20.620
<v Speaker 13>uh,</v>

4625
02:08:20.620 --> 02:08:21.071
<v Speaker 13>you're,</v>

4626
02:08:21.071 --> 02:08:24.430
<v Speaker 13>you're really humble for a guy who fought as much as you fought to.</v>

4627
02:08:24.431 --> 02:08:26.260
<v Speaker 13>You don't bring yourself into it too much.</v>

4628
02:08:26.590 --> 02:08:27.251
<v Speaker 13>And if you do,</v>

4629
02:08:27.251 --> 02:08:29.350
<v Speaker 13>it's like really succinct and important.</v>

4630
02:08:29.380 --> 02:08:31.180
<v Speaker 13>Like you do an awesome job.</v>

4631
02:08:31.720 --> 02:08:32.380
<v Speaker 13>Thank you man.</v>

4632
02:08:32.380 --> 02:08:32.711
<v Speaker 13>I was,</v>

4633
02:08:32.711 --> 02:08:33.430
<v Speaker 13>um,</v>

4634
02:08:33.430 --> 02:08:37.360
<v Speaker 13>I was going to try to not be humble when you said that something smart ass,</v>

4635
02:08:37.361 --> 02:08:38.194
<v Speaker 13>but I couldn't</v>

4636
02:08:39.510 --> 02:08:41.420
<v Speaker 13>blow it away for you by you saying that to thank you.</v>

4637
02:08:41.450 --> 02:08:42.310
<v Speaker 13>Really good man.</v>

4638
02:08:42.580 --> 02:08:44.100
<v Speaker 13>You have a real good insight too.</v>

4639
02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:44.440
<v Speaker 13>You know,</v>

4640
02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:45.011
<v Speaker 13>you're obviously,</v>

4641
02:08:45.011 --> 02:08:47.260
<v Speaker 13>you were very intelligent fighter when you're competing,</v>

4642
02:08:47.261 --> 02:08:49.090
<v Speaker 13>you are very creative and you know,</v>

4643
02:08:49.091 --> 02:08:50.350
<v Speaker 13>you had a very,</v>

4644
02:08:50.380 --> 02:08:50.761
<v Speaker 13>uh,</v>

4645
02:08:50.761 --> 02:08:51.490
<v Speaker 13>a good,</v>

4646
02:08:51.490 --> 02:08:51.701
<v Speaker 13>uh,</v>

4647
02:08:51.701 --> 02:08:53.140
<v Speaker 13>high fight Iq.</v>

4648
02:08:53.141 --> 02:08:55.480
<v Speaker 13>You're very aware of what's going on in at any point in time.</v>

4649
02:08:55.740 --> 02:09:00.740
<v Speaker 13>I think that that intelligence style of a you're fighting makes for really good</v>

4650
02:09:01.061 --> 02:09:02.920
<v Speaker 13>analyst because you,</v>

4651
02:09:02.921 --> 02:09:03.340
<v Speaker 13>uh,</v>

4652
02:09:03.340 --> 02:09:04.173
<v Speaker 13>you're not,</v>

4653
02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:05.040
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

4654
02:09:05.040 --> 02:09:09.370
<v Speaker 13>you weren't a guy who tried to overwhelm anybody with power or aggression or</v>

4655
02:09:09.371 --> 02:09:09.510
<v Speaker 13>any,</v>

4656
02:09:09.510 --> 02:09:09.691
<v Speaker 13>you,</v>

4657
02:09:09.691 --> 02:09:10.011
<v Speaker 13>you were,</v>

4658
02:09:10.011 --> 02:09:14.500
<v Speaker 13>you was laying traps and setting people up and using really clean technique.</v>

4659
02:09:14.740 --> 02:09:15.880
<v Speaker 13>And I find,</v>

4660
02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:16.631
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

4661
02:09:16.631 --> 02:09:17.141
<v Speaker 13>like I said,</v>

4662
02:09:17.141 --> 02:09:19.660
<v Speaker 13>Vandelay probably one of my all time favorite guys to watch because you see</v>

4663
02:09:19.661 --> 02:09:20.770
<v Speaker 13>what's pure chaos.</v>

4664
02:09:21.220 --> 02:09:26.220
<v Speaker 13>But I find that people like yourself oftentimes make really good analysts</v>

4665
02:09:26.830 --> 02:09:31.830
<v Speaker 13>because like you're a guy who was like looking at fighting at whether it's MMA,</v>

4666
02:09:32.111 --> 02:09:33.520
<v Speaker 13>stand up on the ground,</v>

4667
02:09:33.521 --> 02:09:34.354
<v Speaker 13>whatever it was,</v>

4668
02:09:34.480 --> 02:09:38.440
<v Speaker 13>you're looking at it at this very analytical level.</v>

4669
02:09:39.100 --> 02:09:43.390
<v Speaker 13>It's for me it's like asking questions and that's one of my boxing coaches.</v>

4670
02:09:43.391 --> 02:09:46.600
<v Speaker 13>Kenny Weldon used to say that when I fought Aaron the second time,</v>

4671
02:09:46.840 --> 02:09:49.330
<v Speaker 13>he watched the fight after the fact and he was like,</v>

4672
02:09:49.910 --> 02:09:50.291
<v Speaker 13>I was like,</v>

4673
02:09:50.291 --> 02:09:51.260
<v Speaker 13>so what do you think Kenny?</v>

4674
02:09:51.260 --> 02:09:51.940
<v Speaker 13>He goes,</v>

4675
02:09:51.940 --> 02:09:53.740
<v Speaker 13>that kid has a lot of questions.</v>

4676
02:09:54.190 --> 02:09:54.551
<v Speaker 13>It's like,</v>

4677
02:09:54.551 --> 02:09:54.971
<v Speaker 13>what do you mean?</v>

4678
02:09:54.971 --> 02:09:55.840
<v Speaker 13>He has a lot of questions.</v>

4679
02:09:55.841 --> 02:09:56.380
<v Speaker 13>He's like,</v>

4680
02:09:56.380 --> 02:10:00.490
<v Speaker 13>every time you do something you're asking them a question and then I'm sorry,</v>

4681
02:10:00.491 --> 02:10:03.600
<v Speaker 13>every time he does something he's asking you a question and you're answering him</v>

4682
02:10:03.601 --> 02:10:04.330
<v Speaker 13>with like,</v>

4683
02:10:04.330 --> 02:10:07.180
<v Speaker 13>I'm going to do this and what are you going to do about what I'm doing?</v>

4684
02:10:07.510 --> 02:10:08.530
<v Speaker 13>And he's just asking me,</v>

4685
02:10:08.531 --> 02:10:09.400
<v Speaker 13>why are you doing that?</v>

4686
02:10:09.401 --> 02:10:10.300
<v Speaker 13>Why are you doing that?</v>

4687
02:10:10.480 --> 02:10:10.961
<v Speaker 13>So he's like,</v>

4688
02:10:10.961 --> 02:10:14.260
<v Speaker 13>he's saying he's asking all the questions but he has no answers.</v>

4689
02:10:14.650 --> 02:10:16.120
<v Speaker 13>So he's asking me questions.</v>

4690
02:10:16.121 --> 02:10:18.160
<v Speaker 13>I've been giving him matches and um,</v>

4691
02:10:18.730 --> 02:10:22.090
<v Speaker 13>I think that's Kinda how I watched fights or how I fought.</v>

4692
02:10:22.180 --> 02:10:24.850
<v Speaker 13>I would try to do something and see what you're doing because of that.</v>

4693
02:10:25.400 --> 02:10:27.430
<v Speaker 13>You kind of play with that and feel it and,</v>

4694
02:10:27.570 --> 02:10:29.410
<v Speaker 13>and that's how I watch other people fly to watch.</v>

4695
02:10:29.410 --> 02:10:30.460
<v Speaker 13>When I watch guys fight,</v>

4696
02:10:30.461 --> 02:10:30.791
<v Speaker 13>I'm like,</v>

4697
02:10:30.791 --> 02:10:31.511
<v Speaker 13>what is he doing?</v>

4698
02:10:31.511 --> 02:10:32.470
<v Speaker 13>Why is he doing that?</v>

4699
02:10:32.530 --> 02:10:33.800
<v Speaker 13>Is he trying to set something up?</v>

4700
02:10:34.130 --> 02:10:35.060
<v Speaker 13>This guy going to Rhea,</v>

4701
02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:36.380
<v Speaker 13>how's that guy going to react to that?</v>

4702
02:10:36.410 --> 02:10:37.820
<v Speaker 13>What's he going to do about him?</v>

4703
02:10:38.630 --> 02:10:40.250
<v Speaker 13>What's he going to do about his strengths?</v>

4704
02:10:40.251 --> 02:10:41.960
<v Speaker 13>He knows he's coming in with these strengths,</v>

4705
02:10:42.020 --> 02:10:43.820
<v Speaker 13>so how's he going to try and take those things away?</v>

4706
02:10:44.030 --> 02:10:46.340
<v Speaker 13>Or has he just gonna try to impose his own strengths?</v>

4707
02:10:46.380 --> 02:10:47.213
<v Speaker 13>I,</v>

4708
02:10:47.510 --> 02:10:47.931
<v Speaker 13>for me,</v>

4709
02:10:47.931 --> 02:10:49.280
<v Speaker 13>that's what fighting is.</v>

4710
02:10:49.281 --> 02:10:54.281
<v Speaker 13>It's be making yourself as comfortable as you can be at all times while making</v>

4711
02:10:55.101 --> 02:10:57.080
<v Speaker 13>the other guy as uncomfortable as he can be.</v>

4712
02:10:57.950 --> 02:10:58.401
<v Speaker 13>For me.</v>

4713
02:10:58.401 --> 02:10:58.961
<v Speaker 13>That's what I,</v>

4714
02:10:58.961 --> 02:11:02.690
<v Speaker 13>I tried to look at and I try to see if guys play like that.</v>

4715
02:11:02.691 --> 02:11:02.980
<v Speaker 13>How,</v>

4716
02:11:02.980 --> 02:11:04.400
<v Speaker 13>how are they going to play that game?</v>

4717
02:11:05.630 --> 02:11:06.081
<v Speaker 13>Yeah,</v>

4718
02:11:06.081 --> 02:11:11.081
<v Speaker 13>that completely makes sense that you have that kind of style without approach.</v>

4719
02:11:12.260 --> 02:11:12.740
<v Speaker 13>You know,</v>

4720
02:11:12.740 --> 02:11:17.060
<v Speaker 13>I just always admired the way you would set things up.</v>

4721
02:11:17.660 --> 02:11:19.930
<v Speaker 13>You always had a real technical style fund,</v>

4722
02:11:19.970 --> 02:11:20.590
<v Speaker 13>which I mean,</v>

4723
02:11:20.590 --> 02:11:21.140
<v Speaker 13>like I said,</v>

4724
02:11:21.140 --> 02:11:22.490
<v Speaker 13>I admire chaos to,</v>

4725
02:11:22.491 --> 02:11:24.530
<v Speaker 13>I admire those Melvin Manhoef dudes too.</v>

4726
02:11:24.950 --> 02:11:25.261
<v Speaker 13>You know,</v>

4727
02:11:25.261 --> 02:11:25.550
<v Speaker 13>and my,</v>

4728
02:11:25.550 --> 02:11:29.960
<v Speaker 13>I admire a Vandelay like maybe more than anybody just because he was so wild to</v>

4729
02:11:29.961 --> 02:11:30.794
<v Speaker 13>watch.</v>

4730
02:11:31.190 --> 02:11:31.491
<v Speaker 13>But,</v>

4731
02:11:31.491 --> 02:11:31.790
<v Speaker 13>um,</v>

4732
02:11:31.790 --> 02:11:32.180
<v Speaker 13>I found,</v>

4733
02:11:32.180 --> 02:11:35.750
<v Speaker 13>I find that for analysis like Dominick Cruz is another guy I think knocks it out</v>

4734
02:11:35.751 --> 02:11:37.880
<v Speaker 13>of the park because he's so,</v>

4735
02:11:37.970 --> 02:11:42.970
<v Speaker 13>he's so smart and his assessment of risk and reward and putting yourself in a</v>

4736
02:11:43.851 --> 02:11:47.120
<v Speaker 13>position where your opponent doesn't exactly know what you're going to do,</v>

4737
02:11:47.121 --> 02:11:49.540
<v Speaker 13>but you know how he's gonna react because you're,</v>

4738
02:11:49.580 --> 02:11:53.480
<v Speaker 13>you have this awkward style that you've seen other people react to for a long</v>

4739
02:11:53.481 --> 02:11:54.230
<v Speaker 13>time.</v>

4740
02:11:54.230 --> 02:11:56.630
<v Speaker 13>But for them it's like this new thing.</v>

4741
02:11:56.810 --> 02:11:59.240
<v Speaker 13>They're standing in front of this guy who was switching stances.</v>

4742
02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:02.060
<v Speaker 13>And bouncing and moving up and down and back and forth.</v>

4743
02:12:02.061 --> 02:12:05.180
<v Speaker 13>And you're not exactly sure what the fuck he's doing,</v>

4744
02:12:05.570 --> 02:12:06.950
<v Speaker 13>but he knows what you're going to do.</v>

4745
02:12:07.010 --> 02:12:07.310
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

4746
02:12:07.310 --> 02:12:09.320
<v Speaker 13>Because he's so used to doing it to regular people,</v>

4747
02:12:09.321 --> 02:12:10.580
<v Speaker 13>like everybody who stands like,</v>

4748
02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:11.241
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

4749
02:12:11.241 --> 02:12:14.630
<v Speaker 13>like certain guys that have that like Moy Thai style and God,</v>

4750
02:12:14.631 --> 02:12:14.980
<v Speaker 13>they're getting,</v>

4751
02:12:14.980 --> 02:12:18.950
<v Speaker 13>there's so much that they're giving a guy in that situation.</v>

4752
02:12:19.190 --> 02:12:21.170
<v Speaker 13>And when you've got a guy like Dominick Cruz,</v>

4753
02:12:21.171 --> 02:12:23.390
<v Speaker 13>like he's not predictable at all.</v>

4754
02:12:23.510 --> 02:12:28.100
<v Speaker 13>He's like flipping stances and moving around and throwing punches from these</v>

4755
02:12:28.101 --> 02:12:31.940
<v Speaker 13>weird fucking angles where you would swear he's doing it wrong.</v>

4756
02:12:32.090 --> 02:12:32.630
<v Speaker 13>Right.</v>

4757
02:12:32.630 --> 02:12:33.140
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

4758
02:12:33.140 --> 02:12:34.670
<v Speaker 13>It's for me,</v>

4759
02:12:34.671 --> 02:12:38.450
<v Speaker 13>I always look at the way someone explained something to me is as the easiest way</v>

4760
02:12:38.451 --> 02:12:41.000
<v Speaker 13>to explain it and bad ass grin.</v>

4761
02:12:41.030 --> 02:12:43.640
<v Speaker 13>Tyron said Ben Likes to cause scrambles,</v>

4762
02:12:43.900 --> 02:12:44.570
<v Speaker 13>right?</v>

4763
02:12:44.570 --> 02:12:45.620
<v Speaker 13>That's what dom does.</v>

4764
02:12:45.660 --> 02:12:46.010
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

4765
02:12:46.010 --> 02:12:48.500
<v Speaker 13>He's causing scrambles on the feet cause he's,</v>

4766
02:12:48.680 --> 02:12:50.480
<v Speaker 13>he's not in a traditional position.</v>

4767
02:12:50.480 --> 02:12:50.901
<v Speaker 13>He's not,</v>

4768
02:12:50.901 --> 02:12:53.300
<v Speaker 13>and he's not coming at you like everybody else does.</v>

4769
02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:57.350
<v Speaker 13>So what he's doing is initiating a scramble right away when you're,</v>

4770
02:12:57.390 --> 02:12:58.580
<v Speaker 13>when you get a guy on top of you,</v>

4771
02:12:58.581 --> 02:13:01.550
<v Speaker 13>like Rda and he's good at establishing position.</v>

4772
02:13:02.150 --> 02:13:03.500
<v Speaker 13>If you can create a scramble,</v>

4773
02:13:03.740 --> 02:13:05.600
<v Speaker 13>then you have a better chance of getting out.</v>

4774
02:13:05.630 --> 02:13:10.010
<v Speaker 13>Then if you that if you just try to use basic technique and Dominic is</v>

4775
02:13:10.011 --> 02:13:11.300
<v Speaker 13>comfortable in those scrambles,</v>

4776
02:13:11.301 --> 02:13:11.930
<v Speaker 13>he,</v>

4777
02:13:11.930 --> 02:13:13.670
<v Speaker 13>he's been in them so many times.</v>

4778
02:13:13.820 --> 02:13:16.850
<v Speaker 13>When you react you have like three or four reactions.</v>

4779
02:13:17.180 --> 02:13:18.350
<v Speaker 13>But he has like 22.</v>

4780
02:13:18.710 --> 02:13:19.543
<v Speaker 13>Wow.</v>

4781
02:13:19.940 --> 02:13:20.720
<v Speaker 13>Damn.</v>

4782
02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:20.931
<v Speaker 13>You know,</v>

4783
02:13:20.931 --> 02:13:22.070
<v Speaker 13>he did a great breakdown.</v>

4784
02:13:22.400 --> 02:13:25.490
<v Speaker 13>A charac from the underground cure genesis.</v>

4785
02:13:25.610 --> 02:13:26.120
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

4786
02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:26.840
<v Speaker 13>He uh,</v>

4787
02:13:26.840 --> 02:13:29.150
<v Speaker 13>see if he could find that he put it up today.</v>

4788
02:13:30.230 --> 02:13:31.063
<v Speaker 13>He put up a,</v>

4789
02:13:31.070 --> 02:13:32.160
<v Speaker 13>an article</v>

4790
02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:37.020
<v Speaker 1>breaking down all the variables of Dominick Cruz's footwork.</v>

4791
02:13:37.830 --> 02:13:40.050
<v Speaker 1>Really interesting stuff because you don't,</v>

4792
02:13:40.051 --> 02:13:41.750
<v Speaker 1>until you see it as a list,</v>

4793
02:13:42.090 --> 02:13:43.830
<v Speaker 1>like all the different things he does.</v>

4794
02:13:43.860 --> 02:13:45.720
<v Speaker 1>And Keurig did an awesome job of,</v>

4795
02:13:46.500 --> 02:13:50.400
<v Speaker 1>of just sort of a breaking down all the different things in his fights and it</v>

4796
02:13:50.401 --> 02:13:51.480
<v Speaker 1>just makes you realize like,</v>

4797
02:13:51.481 --> 02:13:51.811
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

4798
02:13:51.811 --> 02:13:53.980
<v Speaker 1>that guy's got a lot of options man.</v>

4799
02:13:54.570 --> 02:13:55.171
<v Speaker 1>Like someone was,</v>

4800
02:13:55.171 --> 02:13:57.780
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Ludwig was saying that he doesn't think he has good technique.</v>

4801
02:13:57.781 --> 02:13:58.160
<v Speaker 1>A blanket.</v>

4802
02:13:58.160 --> 02:13:59.250
<v Speaker 1>How can you say that though?</v>

4803
02:13:59.251 --> 02:14:00.840
<v Speaker 1>Cause you land so many punches.</v>

4804
02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:02.130
<v Speaker 1>Like how can you say it?</v>

4805
02:14:02.131 --> 02:14:04.440
<v Speaker 1>Like it might not look like everybody else's,</v>

4806
02:14:04.920 --> 02:14:06.510
<v Speaker 1>but God damn it's working.</v>

4807
02:14:06.750 --> 02:14:07.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4808
02:14:07.110 --> 02:14:07.711
<v Speaker 1>I mean it works.</v>

4809
02:14:07.711 --> 02:14:09.420
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy how effective it is.</v>

4810
02:14:09.480 --> 02:14:10.830
<v Speaker 1>See this is all the stuff that,</v>

4811
02:14:11.430 --> 02:14:12.570
<v Speaker 1>that Kirk wrote down,</v>

4812
02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:14.790
<v Speaker 1>all the different stuff that Dominic does.</v>

4813
02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:17.941
<v Speaker 1>Pretty interesting,</v>

4814
02:14:17.941 --> 02:14:18.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4815
02:14:18.300 --> 02:14:19.133
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

4816
02:14:19.210 --> 02:14:22.260
<v Speaker 1>A neo footwork is what people are calling it,</v>

4817
02:14:22.261 --> 02:14:23.094
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4818
02:14:23.310 --> 02:14:25.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like a Tj Dillashaw style.</v>

4819
02:14:25.411 --> 02:14:27.090
<v Speaker 1>He's got a very interesting style too.</v>

4820
02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:28.410
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

4821
02:14:28.410 --> 02:14:29.243
<v Speaker 1>I uh,</v>

4822
02:14:29.640 --> 02:14:31.440
<v Speaker 1>I hit pads with Dwayne recently.</v>

4823
02:14:31.470 --> 02:14:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Dwayne showed me some stuff and one of the things he's doing,</v>

4824
02:14:33.691 --> 02:14:33.871
<v Speaker 1>his all,</v>

4825
02:14:33.871 --> 02:14:35.400
<v Speaker 1>he's switched stances.</v>

4826
02:14:35.880 --> 02:14:36.870
<v Speaker 1>He's doing like these,</v>

4827
02:14:36.900 --> 02:14:40.050
<v Speaker 1>you're switching and throwing punches as you're switching.</v>

4828
02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:44.790
<v Speaker 1>He's got a lot of this switch stance stuff that he's Rick really incorporating</v>

4829
02:14:44.791 --> 02:14:45.750
<v Speaker 1>into these combinations.</v>

4830
02:14:45.751 --> 02:14:47.310
<v Speaker 1>And you see it a lot from TJ.</v>

4831
02:14:47.670 --> 02:14:50.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean Tj is as comfortable from a south paws.</v>

4832
02:14:50.281 --> 02:14:54.510
<v Speaker 1>He is from an Orthodox and he's doing a lot of these switch moves.</v>

4833
02:14:54.511 --> 02:14:54.861
<v Speaker 1>Like they're,</v>

4834
02:14:54.861 --> 02:14:57.600
<v Speaker 1>they're hitting pads with these and they're very confused.</v>

4835
02:14:58.560 --> 02:14:59.393
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

4836
02:14:59.950 --> 02:15:01.150
<v Speaker 13>So remember when,</v>

4837
02:15:01.151 --> 02:15:03.220
<v Speaker 13>when I said I don't like that style,</v>

4838
02:15:03.221 --> 02:15:07.450
<v Speaker 13>that Geeky pseudo style because not because,</v>

4839
02:15:07.451 --> 02:15:08.890
<v Speaker 13>but Dominic style,</v>

4840
02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:11.590
<v Speaker 13>that style I think is the style to beat that.</v>

4841
02:15:12.190 --> 02:15:16.360
<v Speaker 13>The reason I say that is because the way Dominic is approaching it,</v>

4842
02:15:16.390 --> 02:15:20.500
<v Speaker 13>he's approaching it from a educated,</v>

4843
02:15:20.800 --> 02:15:22.480
<v Speaker 13>I would say more educated,</v>

4844
02:15:22.690 --> 02:15:25.120
<v Speaker 13>more studious place.</v>

4845
02:15:25.230 --> 02:15:25.720
<v Speaker 13>Mm.</v>

4846
02:15:25.720 --> 02:15:30.580
<v Speaker 13>These guys are approaching it from trying to get you to buy the wolf ticket.</v>

4847
02:15:31.170 --> 02:15:31.780
<v Speaker 13>Ah.</v>

4848
02:15:31.780 --> 02:15:32.230
<v Speaker 13>You know,</v>

4849
02:15:32.230 --> 02:15:32.621
<v Speaker 13>so they're,</v>

4850
02:15:32.621 --> 02:15:37.090
<v Speaker 13>they're giving you these weird looks because that's going to make you get off</v>

4851
02:15:37.091 --> 02:15:37.511
<v Speaker 13>balance,</v>

4852
02:15:37.511 --> 02:15:38.710
<v Speaker 13>get stand there for them.</v>

4853
02:15:38.711 --> 02:15:40.300
<v Speaker 13>Be The guy that's just a target.</v>

4854
02:15:40.660 --> 02:15:44.350
<v Speaker 13>But dom is giving you these looks from a fighting perspective.</v>

4855
02:15:44.351 --> 02:15:47.320
<v Speaker 13>He's always in position to fight those guys.</v>

4856
02:15:47.321 --> 02:15:47.711
<v Speaker 13>When you're,</v>

4857
02:15:47.711 --> 02:15:48.610
<v Speaker 13>when you break dancing,</v>

4858
02:15:48.611 --> 02:15:50.140
<v Speaker 13>sometimes you're not in position to react.</v>

4859
02:15:50.680 --> 02:15:55.120
<v Speaker 13>Dom is always in position to react and that's why I think that style is the</v>

4860
02:15:55.121 --> 02:15:58.120
<v Speaker 13>style that beats the other style 10 out of 10 times.</v>

4861
02:15:58.780 --> 02:16:03.070
<v Speaker 13>What's really interesting is I don't recall anybody before Dominick Cruz doing</v>

4862
02:16:03.071 --> 02:16:03.904
<v Speaker 13>it like that.</v>

4863
02:16:04.450 --> 02:16:06.400
<v Speaker 13>I really don't it,</v>

4864
02:16:06.520 --> 02:16:07.840
<v Speaker 13>it's a lot of what,</v>

4865
02:16:07.900 --> 02:16:08.860
<v Speaker 13>I mean it's limited,</v>

4866
02:16:08.890 --> 02:16:12.100
<v Speaker 13>but Muhammad Ali did a lot of things like that with his boxing,</v>

4867
02:16:12.570 --> 02:16:13.010
<v Speaker 13>you know?</v>

4868
02:16:13.010 --> 02:16:13.690
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

4869
02:16:13.690 --> 02:16:16.360
<v Speaker 13>The rope a dope and his footwork that that's,</v>

4870
02:16:16.361 --> 02:16:17.171
<v Speaker 13>that's a part of it.</v>

4871
02:16:17.171 --> 02:16:18.520
<v Speaker 13>That's a part of what dom does.</v>

4872
02:16:18.920 --> 02:16:20.290
<v Speaker 13>Dom does it for MMA,</v>

4873
02:16:20.350 --> 02:16:23.620
<v Speaker 13>so he has to be aware of the kicks tie ups and clinches.</v>

4874
02:16:23.950 --> 02:16:24.251
<v Speaker 13>I mean,</v>

4875
02:16:24.251 --> 02:16:26.740
<v Speaker 13>how many times you see guys press dom on the fence?</v>

4876
02:16:26.920 --> 02:16:27.550
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

4877
02:16:27.550 --> 02:16:28.383
<v Speaker 13>Almost never.</v>

4878
02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:29.110
<v Speaker 13>Never.</v>

4879
02:16:29.110 --> 02:16:31.120
<v Speaker 13>Very rarely do you know,</v>

4880
02:16:31.121 --> 02:16:31.360
<v Speaker 13>the,</v>

4881
02:16:31.360 --> 02:16:33.490
<v Speaker 13>the real super fight is him and mighty mouse.</v>

4882
02:16:33.580 --> 02:16:34.750
<v Speaker 13>That's the real super fight.</v>

4883
02:16:35.380 --> 02:16:36.100
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

4884
02:16:36.100 --> 02:16:38.890
<v Speaker 13>But I mean we saw that you did see it,</v>

4885
02:16:38.891 --> 02:16:39.724
<v Speaker 13>but we saw it.</v>

4886
02:16:40.060 --> 02:16:42.310
<v Speaker 13>I think mighty mouse is far better.</v>

4887
02:16:42.640 --> 02:16:43.150
<v Speaker 13>Yeah,</v>

4888
02:16:43.150 --> 02:16:43.780
<v Speaker 13>I really do.</v>

4889
02:16:43.780 --> 02:16:44.860
<v Speaker 13>But he's so much smaller,</v>

4890
02:16:44.861 --> 02:16:48.460
<v Speaker 13>so much smaller as fact is a fact.</v>

4891
02:16:48.580 --> 02:16:48.911
<v Speaker 13>I mean,</v>

4892
02:16:48.911 --> 02:16:51.700
<v Speaker 13>he's got to be comfortable fighting one 35 when he was always so much smaller</v>

4893
02:16:51.701 --> 02:16:53.110
<v Speaker 13>than those one 35 pound guys.</v>

4894
02:16:53.111 --> 02:16:55.570
<v Speaker 13>But from the,</v>

4895
02:16:55.600 --> 02:16:55.841
<v Speaker 13>uh,</v>

4896
02:16:55.841 --> 02:17:00.490
<v Speaker 13>I think it was the Ian Mccall fight on when Ian Mccall took his back and</v>

4897
02:17:00.491 --> 02:17:01.324
<v Speaker 13>battered him.</v>

4898
02:17:02.170 --> 02:17:03.040
<v Speaker 13>He's talked about it.</v>

4899
02:17:03.041 --> 02:17:06.190
<v Speaker 13>Like that was like the big shifting point where he just realized like,</v>

4900
02:17:06.191 --> 02:17:06.730
<v Speaker 13>um,</v>

4901
02:17:06.730 --> 02:17:08.290
<v Speaker 13>that he's really gotta be dedicated.</v>

4902
02:17:08.291 --> 02:17:08.770
<v Speaker 13>He can't,</v>

4903
02:17:08.770 --> 02:17:10.180
<v Speaker 13>he can't fuck this up anymore.</v>

4904
02:17:10.181 --> 02:17:11.710
<v Speaker 13>I can't have a full time job.</v>

4905
02:17:11.711 --> 02:17:13.450
<v Speaker 13>He can't be taken beatings like that.</v>

4906
02:17:13.990 --> 02:17:18.990
<v Speaker 13>And that it was more of the fact that he wasn't putting the time in versus hip,</v>

4907
02:17:19.931 --> 02:17:22.120
<v Speaker 13>not having the ability to,</v>

4908
02:17:22.121 --> 02:17:23.260
<v Speaker 13>he knew he could fight better than that.</v>

4909
02:17:23.770 --> 02:17:28.600
<v Speaker 13>And so then you see him from that fight on slowly emerge as,</v>

4910
02:17:29.170 --> 02:17:29.951
<v Speaker 13>I mean at this point,</v>

4911
02:17:29.951 --> 02:17:33.280
<v Speaker 13>pretty much the consensus pound for pound best fighter in the world.</v>

4912
02:17:33.310 --> 02:17:35.680
<v Speaker 13>Especially now that John doesn't have a license.</v>

4913
02:17:35.830 --> 02:17:38.530
<v Speaker 13>John was the other guy that was in the mix for that.</v>

4914
02:17:39.010 --> 02:17:41.230
<v Speaker 13>But I think mighty mouse takes less damage,</v>

4915
02:17:41.710 --> 02:17:45.930
<v Speaker 13>is destroying more guys more in more of a,</v>

4916
02:17:45.931 --> 02:17:48.550
<v Speaker 13>a crazy technical impressive fashion.</v>

4917
02:17:48.880 --> 02:17:49.571
<v Speaker 13>Like when he stopped,</v>

4918
02:17:49.571 --> 02:17:53.140
<v Speaker 13>so Hutto I mean that was a work of art man.</v>

4919
02:17:53.170 --> 02:17:55.720
<v Speaker 13>The clinch work and those knees to the body.</v>

4920
02:17:55.750 --> 02:17:58.690
<v Speaker 13>That was as good as I've ever seen anybody beat anybody.</v>

4921
02:17:59.050 --> 02:17:59.620
<v Speaker 13>You know?</v>

4922
02:17:59.620 --> 02:18:00.880
<v Speaker 13>I mean that was his stunning.</v>

4923
02:18:01.360 --> 02:18:01.841
<v Speaker 13>Yeah,</v>

4924
02:18:01.841 --> 02:18:02.260
<v Speaker 13>that's,</v>

4925
02:18:02.260 --> 02:18:05.670
<v Speaker 13>that's the highest level of mixed martial arts is defense too.</v>

4926
02:18:05.980 --> 02:18:07.000
<v Speaker 13>When he went to the ground.</v>

4927
02:18:07.001 --> 02:18:07.960
<v Speaker 13>So who don't took him to the ground,</v>

4928
02:18:07.961 --> 02:18:09.190
<v Speaker 13>he's got butterflies in,</v>

4929
02:18:09.191 --> 02:18:09.971
<v Speaker 13>he's moving,</v>

4930
02:18:09.971 --> 02:18:11.260
<v Speaker 13>he gets back up to his feet.</v>

4931
02:18:11.740 --> 02:18:14.110
<v Speaker 13>I mean some high level shit,</v>

4932
02:18:14.111 --> 02:18:14.250
<v Speaker 13>man.</v>

4933
02:18:14.250 --> 02:18:15.160
<v Speaker 13>He and he and Hertz who,</v>

4934
02:18:15.161 --> 02:18:16.090
<v Speaker 13>who go to the body,</v>

4935
02:18:16.091 --> 02:18:16.481
<v Speaker 13>which is why,</v>

4936
02:18:16.481 --> 02:18:19.240
<v Speaker 13>so who don't took him down super,</v>

4937
02:18:19.241 --> 02:18:20.320
<v Speaker 13>super high level.</v>

4938
02:18:20.340 --> 02:18:20.860
<v Speaker 13>So,</v>

4939
02:18:20.860 --> 02:18:21.880
<v Speaker 13>so the reason I,</v>

4940
02:18:21.881 --> 02:18:26.140
<v Speaker 13>the reason I think a guy like that gets that good especially so quick is because</v>

4941
02:18:27.220 --> 02:18:28.720
<v Speaker 13>he doesn't have a favorite part.</v>

4942
02:18:28.870 --> 02:18:29.830
<v Speaker 13>He doesn't like,</v>

4943
02:18:29.890 --> 02:18:31.150
<v Speaker 13>he loves the whole thing,</v>

4944
02:18:31.630 --> 02:18:31.931
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

4945
02:18:31.931 --> 02:18:32.261
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

4946
02:18:32.261 --> 02:18:35.770
<v Speaker 13>you know those guys that they're good strikers and they love striking.</v>

4947
02:18:35.771 --> 02:18:37.660
<v Speaker 13>So that's what they want to do all the time.</v>

4948
02:18:38.170 --> 02:18:38.591
<v Speaker 13>Like no,</v>

4949
02:18:38.591 --> 02:18:42.910
<v Speaker 13>he works in everything because for his offense to be as good and his defense to</v>

4950
02:18:42.911 --> 02:18:44.050
<v Speaker 13>be just as good.</v>

4951
02:18:44.920 --> 02:18:46.570
<v Speaker 13>A lot of guys just want to be offensive.</v>

4952
02:18:46.571 --> 02:18:49.330
<v Speaker 13>Guys just want to win in the gym that I just want to get on top and they want to</v>

4953
02:18:49.331 --> 02:18:50.620
<v Speaker 13>stay there and they want to control.</v>

4954
02:18:51.340 --> 02:18:53.080
<v Speaker 13>So when those guys get put on their back,</v>

4955
02:18:53.110 --> 02:18:56.860
<v Speaker 13>they don't really know what to do or they have a much harder time escaping or</v>

4956
02:18:56.861 --> 02:18:58.360
<v Speaker 13>transitioning out of that position.</v>

4957
02:18:58.930 --> 02:19:00.920
<v Speaker 13>But not a guy like that though.</v>

4958
02:19:00.940 --> 02:19:02.280
<v Speaker 13>Those are the best guys in the world.</v>

4959
02:19:02.281 --> 02:19:02.801
<v Speaker 13>And you look at,</v>

4960
02:19:02.801 --> 02:19:03.820
<v Speaker 13>you look at Dj,</v>

4961
02:19:03.850 --> 02:19:04.720
<v Speaker 13>you look at dom,</v>

4962
02:19:04.930 --> 02:19:06.100
<v Speaker 13>I mean even Connor,</v>

4963
02:19:06.490 --> 02:19:07.000
<v Speaker 13>right?</v>

4964
02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:07.833
<v Speaker 13>Um,</v>

4965
02:19:08.080 --> 02:19:11.800
<v Speaker 13>the Nate fight is a bad example because that was the first time he was in a</v>

4966
02:19:11.801 --> 02:19:13.320
<v Speaker 13>fight in the UFC and,</v>

4967
02:19:13.321 --> 02:19:15.190
<v Speaker 13>and he didn't like it the second time he did better.</v>

4968
02:19:15.191 --> 02:19:16.390
<v Speaker 13>But at the same thing with chat,</v>

4969
02:19:16.940 --> 02:19:20.410
<v Speaker 13>the little bit of a fight he was in with Mendez when he was on his back,</v>

4970
02:19:20.530 --> 02:19:21.370
<v Speaker 13>he did some work,</v>

4971
02:19:21.760 --> 02:19:22.810
<v Speaker 13>got back to his feet.</v>

4972
02:19:23.050 --> 02:19:23.321
<v Speaker 13>He did.</v>

4973
02:19:23.321 --> 02:19:23.471
<v Speaker 13>He,</v>

4974
02:19:23.471 --> 02:19:26.100
<v Speaker 13>he wasn't so uncomfortable with a,</v>

4975
02:19:26.120 --> 02:19:30.260
<v Speaker 13>with a dominant wrestler that on top that he wasn't going to be able to get back</v>

4976
02:19:30.261 --> 02:19:31.094
<v Speaker 13>up.</v>

4977
02:19:31.610 --> 02:19:32.270
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

4978
02:19:32.270 --> 02:19:32.600
<v Speaker 13>Well,</v>

4979
02:19:32.600 --> 02:19:33.550
<v Speaker 13>Connor is,</v>

4980
02:19:33.551 --> 02:19:34.970
<v Speaker 13>is definitely evolving.</v>

4981
02:19:35.150 --> 02:19:35.500
<v Speaker 13>You know,</v>

4982
02:19:35.500 --> 02:19:35.731
<v Speaker 13>you,</v>

4983
02:19:35.731 --> 02:19:37.130
<v Speaker 13>you could definitely tell that he's,</v>

4984
02:19:37.180 --> 02:19:37.780
<v Speaker 13>uh,</v>

4985
02:19:37.780 --> 02:19:41.120
<v Speaker 13>like especially his approach to the second Nate Diaz fight.</v>

4986
02:19:41.450 --> 02:19:42.171
<v Speaker 13>He fought that fight,</v>

4987
02:19:42.171 --> 02:19:43.004
<v Speaker 13>very smart.</v>

4988
02:19:43.370 --> 02:19:47.060
<v Speaker 13>And He survived some moments where it looks like he was gassing out,</v>

4989
02:19:47.090 --> 02:19:49.520
<v Speaker 13>or at least he got that opportunity to reset.</v>

4990
02:19:49.640 --> 02:19:50.570
<v Speaker 13>If he wasn't gassing out,</v>

4991
02:19:50.571 --> 02:19:51.650
<v Speaker 13>he's definitely diminished.</v>

4992
02:19:52.010 --> 02:19:52.880
<v Speaker 13>But he managed it.</v>

4993
02:19:53.600 --> 02:19:56.150
<v Speaker 13>He managed much better than the first time because I mean,</v>

4994
02:19:56.151 --> 02:19:58.130
<v Speaker 13>when he got in trouble that first time,</v>

4995
02:19:58.610 --> 02:20:00.410
<v Speaker 13>he did try to change the game.</v>

4996
02:20:00.710 --> 02:20:02.960
<v Speaker 13>But when it wasn't in his favor,</v>

4997
02:20:03.170 --> 02:20:03.681
<v Speaker 13>it was like,</v>

4998
02:20:03.681 --> 02:20:05.020
<v Speaker 13>I kind of want out here lady.</v>

4999
02:20:05.080 --> 02:20:05.670
<v Speaker 13>They spear.</v>

5000
02:20:05.670 --> 02:20:06.141
<v Speaker 13>I mean,</v>

5001
02:20:06.141 --> 02:20:06.771
<v Speaker 13>as a fighter,</v>

5002
02:20:06.771 --> 02:20:07.790
<v Speaker 13>I look at that and I'm like,</v>

5003
02:20:08.090 --> 02:20:09.650
<v Speaker 13>his spirit kind of broke there.</v>

5004
02:20:10.220 --> 02:20:13.790
<v Speaker 13>But he asked for that fight again and then he did it again and he did run into</v>

5005
02:20:13.791 --> 02:20:17.900
<v Speaker 13>some trouble and he improved and he fought through it.</v>

5006
02:20:17.901 --> 02:20:19.330
<v Speaker 13>The second time he didn't,</v>

5007
02:20:19.340 --> 02:20:20.091
<v Speaker 13>he wasn't like,</v>

5008
02:20:20.091 --> 02:20:20.241
<v Speaker 13>oh,</v>

5009
02:20:20.241 --> 02:20:21.200
<v Speaker 13>this is a real fight.</v>

5010
02:20:21.201 --> 02:20:22.850
<v Speaker 13>Now I gotta get Outta here.</v>

5011
02:20:22.880 --> 02:20:23.121
<v Speaker 13>No,</v>

5012
02:20:23.121 --> 02:20:23.601
<v Speaker 13>he was like,</v>

5013
02:20:23.601 --> 02:20:24.590
<v Speaker 13>I'm staying right here.</v>

5014
02:20:24.920 --> 02:20:27.950
<v Speaker 13>So I'm excited to see that Conor fight Eddie.</v>

5015
02:20:27.951 --> 02:20:29.750
<v Speaker 13>Because I mean,</v>

5016
02:20:29.751 --> 02:20:30.584
<v Speaker 13>yeah,</v>

5017
02:20:31.130 --> 02:20:32.600
<v Speaker 13>Nate is the same kind of guy.</v>

5018
02:20:32.601 --> 02:20:34.850
<v Speaker 13>He's not going to worry about those kinds of things.</v>

5019
02:20:34.851 --> 02:20:37.820
<v Speaker 13>But like Eddie is a different beast.</v>

5020
02:20:37.830 --> 02:20:38.990
<v Speaker 13>Eddie's that Philly beast.</v>

5021
02:20:39.140 --> 02:20:39.980
<v Speaker 13>He's a savage.</v>

5022
02:20:40.550 --> 02:20:41.271
<v Speaker 13>So I want to see,</v>

5023
02:20:41.271 --> 02:20:45.020
<v Speaker 13>I want to see them get into a fight like not could easily happen to,</v>

5024
02:20:45.190 --> 02:20:46.160
<v Speaker 13>it could easily happen.</v>

5025
02:20:46.970 --> 02:20:48.560
<v Speaker 13>Eddie Abras the fucking savage.</v>

5026
02:20:49.130 --> 02:20:49.963
<v Speaker 13>He really is.</v>

5027
02:20:50.150 --> 02:20:52.180
<v Speaker 13>He watched that Hockfield Los Angeles stoppage.</v>

5028
02:20:52.190 --> 02:20:53.510
<v Speaker 13>Holy Shit.</v>

5029
02:20:54.080 --> 02:20:55.490
<v Speaker 13>The combination he hit him with,</v>

5030
02:20:55.880 --> 02:20:56.301
<v Speaker 13>I mean,</v>

5031
02:20:56.301 --> 02:20:56.781
<v Speaker 13>and the,</v>

5032
02:20:56.781 --> 02:20:57.200
<v Speaker 13>the,</v>

5033
02:20:57.200 --> 02:20:57.740
<v Speaker 13>the,</v>

5034
02:20:57.740 --> 02:21:02.420
<v Speaker 13>the sheer amount of punches he through the barrage that it took to put them</v>

5035
02:21:02.421 --> 02:21:03.254
<v Speaker 13>away.</v>

5036
02:21:03.500 --> 02:21:08.500
<v Speaker 13>I mean he had some fucking serious endurance to press the pace like that.</v>

5037
02:21:09.530 --> 02:21:11.960
<v Speaker 13>That's the one thing that Connor has been struggling with,</v>

5038
02:21:11.961 --> 02:21:12.530
<v Speaker 13>right?</v>

5039
02:21:12.530 --> 02:21:13.330
<v Speaker 13>Yeah,</v>

5040
02:21:13.330 --> 02:21:13.640
<v Speaker 13>yeah.</v>

5041
02:21:13.640 --> 02:21:15.900
<v Speaker 13>With that pace and endurance and,</v>

5042
02:21:15.910 --> 02:21:19.540
<v Speaker 13>and Eddie has the power to put that pace on him when,</v>

5043
02:21:19.541 --> 02:21:22.760
<v Speaker 13>when Nate gets him tired or it gets him hurt on his feet,</v>

5044
02:21:23.250 --> 02:21:25.850
<v Speaker 13>he's got that power and not as dynamic.</v>

5045
02:21:25.940 --> 02:21:26.510
<v Speaker 13>He's,</v>

5046
02:21:26.510 --> 02:21:28.400
<v Speaker 13>he's a very strong guy too.</v>

5047
02:21:28.420 --> 02:21:33.020
<v Speaker 13>Like he's a very strong guy for one 55 I'm looking forward to that too.</v>

5048
02:21:33.280 --> 02:21:37.160
<v Speaker 13>I'm curious actually to see what Connor looks like at 55 because right.</v>

5049
02:21:37.161 --> 02:21:39.140
<v Speaker 13>We haven't seen him there in the UFC.</v>

5050
02:21:39.380 --> 02:21:41.240
<v Speaker 13>We've seen 45 and then you've seen him cut?</v>

5051
02:21:41.241 --> 02:21:45.320
<v Speaker 13>No wait and wait like one 69 I think he weighed against Nate.</v>

5052
02:21:47.060 --> 02:21:50.750
<v Speaker 13>It would be interesting to see what is Connor look like when he's at one 55?</v>

5053
02:21:50.751 --> 02:21:52.540
<v Speaker 13>I mean that might be the perfect weight for him.</v>

5054
02:21:52.541 --> 02:21:53.960
<v Speaker 13>It's entirely possible.</v>

5055
02:21:53.961 --> 02:21:56.300
<v Speaker 13>We might see a better McGregor at one 55.</v>

5056
02:21:56.930 --> 02:21:58.790
<v Speaker 13>I think that's the deepest division.</v>

5057
02:21:58.920 --> 02:21:59.570
<v Speaker 13>Yeah,</v>

5058
02:21:59.570 --> 02:22:01.400
<v Speaker 13>I think it has been for the longest time.</v>

5059
02:22:01.460 --> 02:22:03.200
<v Speaker 13>And that if,</v>

5060
02:22:03.201 --> 02:22:03.411
<v Speaker 13>if,</v>

5061
02:22:03.411 --> 02:22:05.600
<v Speaker 13>if anybody dominates that division,</v>

5062
02:22:05.870 --> 02:22:07.340
<v Speaker 13>like Rda did it for a little,</v>

5063
02:22:07.341 --> 02:22:09.020
<v Speaker 13>he looked dominant for a little bit.</v>

5064
02:22:09.050 --> 02:22:09.860
<v Speaker 13>Um,</v>

5065
02:22:09.860 --> 02:22:11.420
<v Speaker 13>even coming up to the title fight,</v>

5066
02:22:11.450 --> 02:22:13.910
<v Speaker 13>he looked like he was going to hold on to that for a while.</v>

5067
02:22:14.570 --> 02:22:15.380
<v Speaker 13>Um,</v>

5068
02:22:15.380 --> 02:22:19.400
<v Speaker 13>but everybody there so close everybody that way class is so close.</v>

5069
02:22:19.640 --> 02:22:21.640
<v Speaker 13>So if somebody does it well,</v>

5070
02:22:21.641 --> 02:22:26.280
<v Speaker 13>what about Norma Grumet off because he ragdolled everybody he's gotten in there</v>

5071
02:22:26.281 --> 02:22:26.610
<v Speaker 13>with,</v>

5072
02:22:26.610 --> 02:22:29.540
<v Speaker 13>that's the one guy you can't say it's close with because everybody,</v>

5073
02:22:29.541 --> 02:22:30.271
<v Speaker 13>he's got a hold of,</v>

5074
02:22:30.271 --> 02:22:33.000
<v Speaker 13>he's beating the fuck out of that guy is special.</v>

5075
02:22:33.120 --> 02:22:33.540
<v Speaker 13>Right?</v>

5076
02:22:33.540 --> 02:22:34.980
<v Speaker 13>That's your man off a special.</v>

5077
02:22:35.040 --> 02:22:35.873
<v Speaker 13>That's true.</v>

5078
02:22:36.010 --> 02:22:36.843
<v Speaker 13>I like,</v>

5079
02:22:36.900 --> 02:22:40.650
<v Speaker 13>I like that guy because what you said he special.</v>

5080
02:22:40.680 --> 02:22:40.980
<v Speaker 13>Right?</v>

5081
02:22:40.980 --> 02:22:42.900
<v Speaker 13>And when you see that special thing,</v>

5082
02:22:43.110 --> 02:22:47.970
<v Speaker 13>then I guess people kind of get lost in the void when everybody's close to being</v>

5083
02:22:47.971 --> 02:22:49.200
<v Speaker 13>just as good as each other.</v>

5084
02:22:49.440 --> 02:22:52.470
<v Speaker 13>Then you kinda just fight to get just a little bit better than the other guy,</v>

5085
02:22:52.471 --> 02:22:53.750
<v Speaker 13>just a little bit better than the other.</v>

5086
02:22:53.760 --> 02:22:54.990
<v Speaker 13>I just gotta be better than him.</v>

5087
02:22:55.170 --> 02:22:59.040
<v Speaker 13>But then when you get the John Jones that comes into the arena and he's,</v>

5088
02:22:59.200 --> 02:23:01.890
<v Speaker 13>she's leaps and bounds ahead of everybody else,</v>

5089
02:23:02.220 --> 02:23:05.520
<v Speaker 13>then you realize there's a bigger gap and guys start closing that.</v>

5090
02:23:05.820 --> 02:23:06.360
<v Speaker 13>Right.</v>

5091
02:23:06.360 --> 02:23:09.000
<v Speaker 13>Like a Alyse Alinka Alexander Gusterson.</v>

5092
02:23:09.080 --> 02:23:09.913
<v Speaker 13>I mean,</v>

5093
02:23:10.050 --> 02:23:11.790
<v Speaker 13>he always fights at that level,</v>

5094
02:23:11.791 --> 02:23:13.140
<v Speaker 13>especially when he's in a title fight.</v>

5095
02:23:13.410 --> 02:23:14.970
<v Speaker 13>But I don't know if,</v>

5096
02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.040
<v Speaker 13>if John Jones didn't exist,</v>

5097
02:23:17.190 --> 02:23:19.170
<v Speaker 13>if he would rise to that occasion.</v>

5098
02:23:19.380 --> 02:23:19.800
<v Speaker 13>Hmm.</v>

5099
02:23:19.800 --> 02:23:20.633
<v Speaker 13>What I mean,</v>

5100
02:23:21.510 --> 02:23:22.191
<v Speaker 13>he sold.</v>

5101
02:23:22.191 --> 02:23:26.130
<v Speaker 13>So somebody's got to show up in the lightweight division at some point like that</v>

5102
02:23:26.370 --> 02:23:26.751
<v Speaker 13>too,</v>

5103
02:23:26.751 --> 02:23:29.250
<v Speaker 13>to make people raise their level.</v>

5104
02:23:29.430 --> 02:23:30.780
<v Speaker 13>Because guys right now,</v>

5105
02:23:30.781 --> 02:23:32.790
<v Speaker 13>which is the deepest and toughest division,</v>

5106
02:23:33.090 --> 02:23:36.600
<v Speaker 13>but guys are so close and maybe no Maga Madoff is that guy.</v>

5107
02:23:37.220 --> 02:23:38.053
<v Speaker 13>Hmm.</v>

5108
02:23:38.270 --> 02:23:38.361
<v Speaker 13>Well,</v>

5109
02:23:38.361 --> 02:23:40.860
<v Speaker 13>he certainly has been in when it comes to grappling,</v>

5110
02:23:41.280 --> 02:23:41.821
<v Speaker 13>like what he did,</v>

5111
02:23:41.821 --> 02:23:43.320
<v Speaker 13>the Dos Anjos was,</v>

5112
02:23:43.330 --> 02:23:44.370
<v Speaker 13>was pretty stunning,</v>

5113
02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:45.211
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

5114
02:23:45.211 --> 02:23:45.811
<v Speaker 13>because there was like,</v>

5115
02:23:45.811 --> 02:23:46.511
<v Speaker 13>man though Sandra,</v>

5116
02:23:46.511 --> 02:23:49.170
<v Speaker 13>this is a legit Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt,</v>

5117
02:23:49.171 --> 02:23:50.370
<v Speaker 13>super strong guy,</v>

5118
02:23:50.610 --> 02:23:53.760
<v Speaker 13>really good on the ground and it just seemed like number Grumet off.</v>

5119
02:23:53.761 --> 02:23:56.340
<v Speaker 13>Just got ahold of them and just did whatever the fuck you wanted to.</v>

5120
02:23:56.340 --> 02:23:57.330
<v Speaker 13>Once we got him on the ground,</v>

5121
02:23:57.810 --> 02:23:58.890
<v Speaker 13>just throws dudes around.</v>

5122
02:23:58.891 --> 02:24:00.420
<v Speaker 13>It's almost like he's built different,</v>

5123
02:24:00.840 --> 02:24:01.650
<v Speaker 13>but he doesn't,</v>

5124
02:24:01.650 --> 02:24:01.921
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

5125
02:24:01.921 --> 02:24:04.770
<v Speaker 13>like if Gleason Tibau was doing that to dude's,</v>

5126
02:24:04.860 --> 02:24:05.341
<v Speaker 13>I'd go,</v>

5127
02:24:05.341 --> 02:24:06.420
<v Speaker 13>I that makes sense.</v>

5128
02:24:06.421 --> 02:24:07.500
<v Speaker 13>Look at that fucking guy.</v>

5129
02:24:07.770 --> 02:24:09.210
<v Speaker 13>But when Norma Madoff does it,</v>

5130
02:24:10.080 --> 02:24:13.680
<v Speaker 13>it's not necessarily just some overwhelming physical attribute.</v>

5131
02:24:13.950 --> 02:24:16.320
<v Speaker 13>It's his technique and his aggression.</v>

5132
02:24:17.010 --> 02:24:17.430
<v Speaker 13>Just,</v>

5133
02:24:17.430 --> 02:24:21.990
<v Speaker 13>just super fucking aggressive and tight with his grappling and his positioning</v>

5134
02:24:21.991 --> 02:24:23.880
<v Speaker 13>his ground and pound his horrific.</v>

5135
02:24:24.210 --> 02:24:25.410
<v Speaker 13>He's a scary dude,</v>

5136
02:24:25.411 --> 02:24:26.244
<v Speaker 13>man.</v>

5137
02:24:26.940 --> 02:24:27.360
<v Speaker 13>He doesn't,</v>

5138
02:24:27.360 --> 02:24:30.030
<v Speaker 13>he doesn't even have to think about the way he does those moves.</v>

5139
02:24:30.060 --> 02:24:33.360
<v Speaker 13>I remember when you said that and when you say ragdoll on people and Rda,</v>

5140
02:24:33.630 --> 02:24:38.480
<v Speaker 13>Rda took that shot on him and he was in the third and he hit him with it.</v>

5141
02:24:38.510 --> 02:24:43.020
<v Speaker 13>Uchi Mata basically right from the over Hook whizzer and tripped him forcing it.</v>

5142
02:24:43.021 --> 02:24:45.030
<v Speaker 13>And that's not easy throw to hit.</v>

5143
02:24:45.180 --> 02:24:46.500
<v Speaker 13>And especially from that range,</v>

5144
02:24:46.501 --> 02:24:48.000
<v Speaker 13>it didn't look like it was going to happen,</v>

5145
02:24:48.001 --> 02:24:52.240
<v Speaker 13>but he does it to the guy who goes on and become the world champion that way.</v>

5146
02:24:52.241 --> 02:24:54.420
<v Speaker 13>And then dominate other guys at that weight class.</v>

5147
02:24:54.870 --> 02:24:55.261
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

5148
02:24:55.261 --> 02:24:56.610
<v Speaker 13>Like that guy is special man.</v>

5149
02:24:56.611 --> 02:24:57.241
<v Speaker 13>I wanna see,</v>

5150
02:24:57.241 --> 02:25:00.780
<v Speaker 13>I wanna see him improve his standup and get and get and just get better.</v>

5151
02:25:00.781 --> 02:25:02.820
<v Speaker 13>I want to see him do things like Dj is,</v>

5152
02:25:02.821 --> 02:25:03.061
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

5153
02:25:03.061 --> 02:25:05.460
<v Speaker 13>just working on his weaknesses and get,</v>

5154
02:25:06.150 --> 02:25:09.210
<v Speaker 13>cause I mean that guy would never lose.</v>

5155
02:25:13.020 --> 02:25:14.390
<v Speaker 13>Imagine if he had Djs,</v>

5156
02:25:14.880 --> 02:25:16.770
<v Speaker 13>MMA Iq and skillset,</v>

5157
02:25:17.150 --> 02:25:18.330
<v Speaker 13>but his rest with,</v>

5158
02:25:18.340 --> 02:25:18.990
<v Speaker 13>with his red,</v>

5159
02:25:18.990 --> 02:25:22.410
<v Speaker 13>what is wrestling in ground is now like who's beaten that guy?</v>

5160
02:25:22.650 --> 02:25:24.490
<v Speaker 13>I would send guy to fight wars for me.</v>

5161
02:25:28.330 --> 02:25:29.080
<v Speaker 13>Yeah man,</v>

5162
02:25:29.080 --> 02:25:29.381
<v Speaker 13>look,</v>

5163
02:25:29.381 --> 02:25:32.440
<v Speaker 13>he's he rag dolls dudes in a very unusual way.</v>

5164
02:25:32.660 --> 02:25:33.130
<v Speaker 13>And you,</v>

5165
02:25:33.130 --> 02:25:35.770
<v Speaker 13>every now and then a guy will come up like that that can do that.</v>

5166
02:25:35.950 --> 02:25:38.560
<v Speaker 13>And he does it with intensity and aggression.</v>

5167
02:25:38.561 --> 02:25:40.240
<v Speaker 13>Like Damien Maia,</v>

5168
02:25:40.241 --> 02:25:40.871
<v Speaker 13>rag dolls,</v>

5169
02:25:40.871 --> 02:25:41.860
<v Speaker 13>a lot of people too,</v>

5170
02:25:42.010 --> 02:25:43.210
<v Speaker 13>especially lately,</v>

5171
02:25:43.690 --> 02:25:45.970
<v Speaker 13>he gets a hold of guys like I did with Rick story,</v>

5172
02:25:45.971 --> 02:25:49.150
<v Speaker 13>but he's doing it in like this technical squeezy way.</v>

5173
02:25:49.570 --> 02:25:52.190
<v Speaker 13>You know when Norma girl Madoff gets a hold of dudes,</v>

5174
02:25:52.191 --> 02:25:53.560
<v Speaker 13>it's a smash.</v>

5175
02:25:53.561 --> 02:25:55.000
<v Speaker 13>Everything is smash.</v>

5176
02:25:55.240 --> 02:25:56.950
<v Speaker 13>He's driving you into the ground,</v>

5177
02:25:56.951 --> 02:25:58.990
<v Speaker 13>smashing you into the ground that's smashing.</v>

5178
02:25:58.991 --> 02:25:59.830
<v Speaker 13>When you're on top of you.</v>

5179
02:26:00.250 --> 02:26:02.380
<v Speaker 13>Damien Maia is just constricting.</v>

5180
02:26:02.381 --> 02:26:06.770
<v Speaker 13>He's like moving into position and he slowly closing you off and he's gonna</v>

5181
02:26:06.790 --> 02:26:07.623
<v Speaker 13>choke you.</v>

5182
02:26:07.630 --> 02:26:09.790
<v Speaker 13>It's a totally different kind of domination.</v>

5183
02:26:10.630 --> 02:26:11.463
<v Speaker 13>But then,</v>

5184
02:26:11.800 --> 02:26:14.110
<v Speaker 13>I don't know if it's entirely the fairest comparison,</v>

5185
02:26:14.111 --> 02:26:15.920
<v Speaker 13>cause Damien is obviously far,</v>

5186
02:26:15.940 --> 02:26:19.410
<v Speaker 13>much longer career and he fought at one 85 and he fought again.</v>

5187
02:26:19.450 --> 02:26:20.590
<v Speaker 13>It's against Anderson.</v>

5188
02:26:20.591 --> 02:26:21.730
<v Speaker 13>He got knocked out by Nate.</v>

5189
02:26:22.300 --> 02:26:24.730
<v Speaker 13>He's had a lot of ups and downs in the UFC.</v>

5190
02:26:25.090 --> 02:26:26.620
<v Speaker 13>Jake shields beat him.</v>

5191
02:26:26.621 --> 02:26:29.320
<v Speaker 13>People forget that Jake Shields essentially out grappled them,</v>

5192
02:26:31.480 --> 02:26:32.440
<v Speaker 13>but number coming in off.</v>

5193
02:26:32.470 --> 02:26:33.040
<v Speaker 13>Good luck.</v>

5194
02:26:33.040 --> 02:26:33.671
<v Speaker 13>Good luck out.</v>

5195
02:26:33.671 --> 02:26:34.600
<v Speaker 13>Grapple that dude.</v>

5196
02:26:34.990 --> 02:26:35.823
<v Speaker 13>Good luck.</v>

5197
02:26:37.120 --> 02:26:37.721
<v Speaker 13>But what's his,</v>

5198
02:26:37.721 --> 02:26:38.441
<v Speaker 13>what does it take down?</v>

5199
02:26:38.441 --> 02:26:39.430
<v Speaker 13>Percentage like two,</v>

5200
02:26:39.610 --> 02:26:41.140
<v Speaker 13>it's probably a million percent.</v>

5201
02:26:42.640 --> 02:26:42.881
<v Speaker 13>I mean,</v>

5202
02:26:42.881 --> 02:26:43.960
<v Speaker 13>he takes down everybody.</v>

5203
02:26:44.190 --> 02:26:46.630
<v Speaker 13>But the other thing about number go Madoff is um,</v>

5204
02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:47.201
<v Speaker 13>uh,</v>

5205
02:26:47.201 --> 02:26:50.680
<v Speaker 13>that he gets injured a lot and you got to wonder,</v>

5206
02:26:50.740 --> 02:26:55.180
<v Speaker 13>is it because of that insane fucking aggressive style of his,</v>

5207
02:26:55.181 --> 02:26:55.830
<v Speaker 13>it's so,</v>

5208
02:26:55.830 --> 02:26:57.370
<v Speaker 13>it makes it so fun to watch him.</v>

5209
02:26:58.270 --> 02:27:01.060
<v Speaker 13>Is that like you're kind of red lining your body too much?</v>

5210
02:27:03.910 --> 02:27:04.121
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

5211
02:27:04.121 --> 02:27:04.540
<v Speaker 13>Right?</v>

5212
02:27:04.540 --> 02:27:05.373
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

5213
02:27:05.920 --> 02:27:06.161
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

5214
02:27:06.161 --> 02:27:06.401
<v Speaker 13>I mean,</v>

5215
02:27:06.401 --> 02:27:07.150
<v Speaker 13>you got arrest,</v>

5216
02:27:07.150 --> 02:27:07.570
<v Speaker 13>right?</v>

5217
02:27:07.570 --> 02:27:08.500
<v Speaker 13>You gotta heal up.</v>

5218
02:27:08.501 --> 02:27:09.970
<v Speaker 13>You can't always be on.</v>

5219
02:27:10.540 --> 02:27:10.991
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

5220
02:27:10.991 --> 02:27:11.890
<v Speaker 13>But I mean,</v>

5221
02:27:11.891 --> 02:27:15.850
<v Speaker 13>can a guide like a Damien Maia who trains very technically,</v>

5222
02:27:16.390 --> 02:27:19.480
<v Speaker 13>I mean obviously he wrestles and he does like a lot of chaotic movements as</v>

5223
02:27:19.481 --> 02:27:19.751
<v Speaker 13>well,</v>

5224
02:27:19.751 --> 02:27:24.370
<v Speaker 13>but probably not nearly with the kind of intensity the number men off does.</v>

5225
02:27:25.120 --> 02:27:25.960
<v Speaker 13>You've got to wonder,</v>

5226
02:27:25.961 --> 02:27:30.961
<v Speaker 13>like that style is obviously super effective and very fucking devastating and</v>

5227
02:27:31.391 --> 02:27:32.224
<v Speaker 13>fun to watch.</v>

5228
02:27:32.530 --> 02:27:37.300
<v Speaker 13>But I wonder if preparing for that style and executing that style is almost like</v>

5229
02:27:37.301 --> 02:27:39.220
<v Speaker 13>ultimately too much on your joints,</v>

5230
02:27:39.280 --> 02:27:40.540
<v Speaker 13>too much on your body.</v>

5231
02:27:41.260 --> 02:27:46.260
<v Speaker 13>I guess the question would be then is can he be no a Madoff without that style?</v>

5232
02:27:49.650 --> 02:27:53.840
<v Speaker 13>Like does he have the skill to translate that to slowing it down and,</v>

5233
02:27:54.140 --> 02:27:54.540
<v Speaker 13>and,</v>

5234
02:27:54.540 --> 02:27:55.840
<v Speaker 13>and turning the volume down.</v>

5235
02:27:56.080 --> 02:27:59.020
<v Speaker 13>It's not what you always wonder about when a fighter gets injured,</v>

5236
02:27:59.080 --> 02:28:01.030
<v Speaker 13>when someone blows a knee out or something like that.</v>

5237
02:28:01.420 --> 02:28:01.961
<v Speaker 13>That and,</v>

5238
02:28:01.961 --> 02:28:02.261
<v Speaker 13>and,</v>

5239
02:28:02.261 --> 02:28:03.850
<v Speaker 13>and the situation they're training in.</v>

5240
02:28:04.190 --> 02:28:05.023
<v Speaker 13>I mean,</v>

5241
02:28:05.050 --> 02:28:05.381
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

5242
02:28:05.381 --> 02:28:07.270
<v Speaker 13>you go into a boxing gym to this day,</v>

5243
02:28:07.271 --> 02:28:10.000
<v Speaker 13>you go into a boxing gym and it's sparring day.</v>

5244
02:28:10.001 --> 02:28:12.910
<v Speaker 13>You go up the wildcard exploring day and there's only two guys in the ring.</v>

5245
02:28:13.570 --> 02:28:15.790
<v Speaker 13>There's only the two guys that are punching each other in the ring.</v>

5246
02:28:16.090 --> 02:28:20.170
<v Speaker 13>You go to an MMA gym and on the Mat there you and I work in.</v>

5247
02:28:20.200 --> 02:28:23.690
<v Speaker 13>But then Joe and and and someone else or working over here and that guy tries to</v>

5248
02:28:23.691 --> 02:28:23.990
<v Speaker 13>take,</v>

5249
02:28:23.990 --> 02:28:26.140
<v Speaker 13>take Joe down and he runs into my heel.</v>

5250
02:28:26.390 --> 02:28:26.661
<v Speaker 13>Got It.</v>

5251
02:28:26.661 --> 02:28:27.680
<v Speaker 13>Does happen all the time.</v>

5252
02:28:28.670 --> 02:28:30.050
<v Speaker 13>I think that happened to Rashad Evans.</v>

5253
02:28:30.051 --> 02:28:34.550
<v Speaker 13>I think that's how he didn't fight against Shogun for the title.</v>

5254
02:28:36.920 --> 02:28:38.300
<v Speaker 13>Wasn't that what happened to Dominic?</v>

5255
02:28:38.360 --> 02:28:39.290
<v Speaker 13>Did it happen to him as well?</v>

5256
02:28:39.320 --> 02:28:39.831
<v Speaker 13>I wouldn't,</v>

5257
02:28:39.831 --> 02:28:40.670
<v Speaker 13>I wouldn't doubt it.</v>

5258
02:28:40.940 --> 02:28:41.251
<v Speaker 13>Got It.</v>

5259
02:28:41.251 --> 02:28:42.084
<v Speaker 13>So common,</v>

5260
02:28:42.350 --> 02:28:46.010
<v Speaker 13>it's crazy because that would be way more safe in boxing and they don't do it in</v>

5261
02:28:46.011 --> 02:28:46.844
<v Speaker 13>boxing.</v>

5262
02:28:46.920 --> 02:28:47.731
<v Speaker 13>Like in boxing,</v>

5263
02:28:47.731 --> 02:28:48.620
<v Speaker 13>it'd be way more safe.</v>

5264
02:28:48.621 --> 02:28:49.050
<v Speaker 13>Right.</v>

5265
02:28:49.050 --> 02:28:51.230
<v Speaker 13>It'd be much less likely that you're going to collide.</v>

5266
02:28:51.590 --> 02:28:52.423
<v Speaker 13>Take downs.</v>

5267
02:28:53.160 --> 02:28:56.360
<v Speaker 13>The k the takedown was especially cause you know like as well as I do.</v>

5268
02:28:56.361 --> 02:28:57.360
<v Speaker 13>If two guys are going at it,</v>

5269
02:28:57.380 --> 02:28:58.211
<v Speaker 13>one guy's defending in,</v>

5270
02:28:58.211 --> 02:28:59.570
<v Speaker 13>the other guys weren't really insistent.</v>

5271
02:28:59.720 --> 02:29:01.520
<v Speaker 13>They could go all the way across the fucking gym.</v>

5272
02:29:01.590 --> 02:29:02.030
<v Speaker 13>Yup.</v>

5273
02:29:02.030 --> 02:29:03.080
<v Speaker 13>Everybody's seen it and everyone's like,</v>

5274
02:29:03.081 --> 02:29:03.280
<v Speaker 13>Whoa,</v>

5275
02:29:03.280 --> 02:29:03.411
<v Speaker 13>Whoa,</v>

5276
02:29:03.411 --> 02:29:03.591
<v Speaker 13>Whoa,</v>

5277
02:29:03.591 --> 02:29:03.771
<v Speaker 13>Whoa,</v>

5278
02:29:03.771 --> 02:29:04.100
<v Speaker 13>Whoa,</v>

5279
02:29:04.100 --> 02:29:04.521
<v Speaker 13>Whoa,</v>

5280
02:29:04.521 --> 02:29:05.480
<v Speaker 13>whoa man.</v>

5281
02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:07.730
<v Speaker 13>And now you have all of these takedown.</v>

5282
02:29:07.731 --> 02:29:09.320
<v Speaker 13>What marks all over the mat?</v>

5283
02:29:09.350 --> 02:29:10.610
<v Speaker 13>You have just these puddles.</v>

5284
02:29:10.640 --> 02:29:11.473
<v Speaker 13>Exactly.</v>

5285
02:29:12.140 --> 02:29:14.420
<v Speaker 13>That fucks kickboxing up hardcore.</v>

5286
02:29:15.370 --> 02:29:20.060
<v Speaker 13>Those member when they used to have fights where the Matt would have like some</v>

5287
02:29:20.061 --> 02:29:23.570
<v Speaker 13>sort of a us some logo on it and they,</v>

5288
02:29:23.571 --> 02:29:25.430
<v Speaker 13>before they figured out how to do that right.</v>

5289
02:29:25.460 --> 02:29:27.050
<v Speaker 13>Those things would be wet.</v>

5290
02:29:27.051 --> 02:29:31.700
<v Speaker 13>It's fucked from the sweat and they would become like ice skating and you just</v>

5291
02:29:31.910 --> 02:29:33.830
<v Speaker 13>throw a kick and go flying through the air.</v>

5292
02:29:34.730 --> 02:29:36.230
<v Speaker 13>I thought at that I'm king of the cage.</v>

5293
02:29:36.231 --> 02:29:37.064
<v Speaker 13>Wet and wild.</v>

5294
02:29:37.430 --> 02:29:38.120
<v Speaker 13>That's right.</v>

5295
02:29:38.120 --> 02:29:38.953
<v Speaker 13>You did.</v>

5296
02:29:39.330 --> 02:29:40.640

5298
02:29:42.051 --> 02:29:42.440
<v Speaker 13>Cause that,</v>

5299
02:29:42.440 --> 02:29:47.360
<v Speaker 13>that I think to this day is like one of the all time legendary fight cards.</v>

5300
02:29:47.750 --> 02:29:48.920
<v Speaker 13>Do you know about king in the cage?</v>

5301
02:29:48.921 --> 02:29:49.754

5304
02:29:54.341 --> 02:29:54.591
<v Speaker 13>we're,</v>

5305
02:29:54.591 --> 02:29:56.880
<v Speaker 13>we're supposed to fight outside at um,</v>

5306
02:29:57.110 --> 02:29:57.931
<v Speaker 13>Soboba is,</v>

02:29:58.191 --> 02:29:59.290
<v Speaker 13>maybe as it's boob.</v>

5309
02:29:59.300 --> 02:30:00.220
<v Speaker 13>Is that what came in the cage?</v>

5310
02:30:00.430 --> 02:30:00.600
<v Speaker 13>Well,</v>

5311
02:30:00.600 --> 02:30:01.161
<v Speaker 13>I don't remember,</v>

5312
02:30:01.161 --> 02:30:02.930
<v Speaker 13>but it was a native American casino.</v>

5313
02:30:02.931 --> 02:30:03.680
<v Speaker 13>I remember that.</v>

5314
02:30:03.680 --> 02:30:05.870
<v Speaker 13>And we were fighting outside king,</v>

5315
02:30:05.900 --> 02:30:07.520
<v Speaker 13>all the king of the cage events where outside.</v>

5316
02:30:07.521 --> 02:30:09.830
<v Speaker 13>But it starts raining and everybody's,</v>

5317
02:30:09.831 --> 02:30:11.600
<v Speaker 13>everybody's ready to fight.</v>

5318
02:30:11.930 --> 02:30:13.580
<v Speaker 13>They still ready to put on the show.</v>

5319
02:30:13.880 --> 02:30:14.810
<v Speaker 13>I'm king of the cage.</v>

5320
02:30:14.811 --> 02:30:15.890
<v Speaker 13>You could wear shoes in Kik.</v>

5321
02:30:15.920 --> 02:30:20.920
<v Speaker 13>So basically we went out there and fought in the rain on a vinyl mat.</v>

5322
02:30:22.290 --> 02:30:23.123
<v Speaker 13>Ah,</v>

5323
02:30:23.780 --> 02:30:24.940
<v Speaker 13>it was even was you,</v>

5324
02:30:26.800 --> 02:30:27.670
<v Speaker 13>you fought the Jared,</v>

5325
02:30:28.200 --> 02:30:32.420
<v Speaker 13>was that the same Jeremy Williams that went on to fight Nate Diaz or Nick Diaz?</v>

5326
02:30:32.680 --> 02:30:33.480
<v Speaker 13>Is that the same guy?</v>

5327
02:30:33.480 --> 02:30:34.160
<v Speaker 13>I think so.</v>

5328
02:30:34.160 --> 02:30:35.420
<v Speaker 13>The guy was on the ultimate fighter.</v>

5329
02:30:35.600 --> 02:30:36.433
<v Speaker 13>Is that the one I'm thinking of?</v>

5330
02:30:36.620 --> 02:30:38.450
<v Speaker 13>I'm thinking of the wrong guy and think of the wrong guy.</v>

5331
02:30:38.840 --> 02:30:41.450
<v Speaker 13>The Jeremy Williams is the guy that committed suicide.</v>

5332
02:30:42.020 --> 02:30:43.820
<v Speaker 13>Oh Damn,</v>

5333
02:30:43.821 --> 02:30:44.654
<v Speaker 13>that's right.</v>

5334
02:30:45.200 --> 02:30:46.550
<v Speaker 13>I knew that guy.</v>

5335
02:30:47.030 --> 02:30:50.300
<v Speaker 13>There's another Jeremy Williams who was the light heavyweight guy,</v>

5336
02:30:50.301 --> 02:30:50.570
<v Speaker 13>right?</v>

5337
02:30:50.570 --> 02:30:51.403
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

5338
02:30:52.150 --> 02:30:52.730
<v Speaker 13>Oh,</v>

5339
02:30:52.730 --> 02:30:53.361
<v Speaker 13>that's right.</v>

5340
02:30:53.361 --> 02:30:54.650
<v Speaker 13>He was a good dude,</v>

5341
02:30:54.651 --> 02:30:55.130
<v Speaker 13>man.</v>

5342
02:30:55.130 --> 02:30:57.590
<v Speaker 13>That was a bummer for a lot of people when that happened.</v>

5343
02:30:58.130 --> 02:30:59.060
<v Speaker 13>I didn't really know him.</v>

5344
02:30:59.061 --> 02:30:59.181
<v Speaker 13>We,</v>

5345
02:30:59.181 --> 02:31:00.650
<v Speaker 13>we kind of stayed in touch of course,</v>

5346
02:31:00.651 --> 02:31:02.530
<v Speaker 13>and you see each other at other events and whatnot.</v>

5347
02:31:02.570 --> 02:31:02.930
<v Speaker 13>And it was,</v>

5348
02:31:02.930 --> 02:31:03.920
<v Speaker 13>I had no beef with him,</v>

5349
02:31:03.921 --> 02:31:05.330
<v Speaker 13>so we would keep talking.</v>

5350
02:31:05.690 --> 02:31:06.523
<v Speaker 13>Um,</v>

5351
02:31:06.540 --> 02:31:07.940
<v Speaker 13>and he always seemed like a nice guy,</v>

5352
02:31:07.970 --> 02:31:08.300
<v Speaker 13>man.</v>

5353
02:31:08.300 --> 02:31:10.190
<v Speaker 13>He was friends with Chris Brennan.</v>

5354
02:31:10.250 --> 02:31:10.591
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

5355
02:31:10.591 --> 02:31:11.110
<v Speaker 13>That's minimum.</v>

5356
02:31:11.110 --> 02:31:11.801
<v Speaker 13>Curtis Brennan.</v>

5357
02:31:11.801 --> 02:31:12.460
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

5358
02:31:12.460 --> 02:31:13.161
<v Speaker 13>And Chris Brennan,</v>

5359
02:31:13.161 --> 02:31:15.170
<v Speaker 13>who's always been a really good dude.</v>

5360
02:31:15.240 --> 02:31:15.560
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

5361
02:31:15.560 --> 02:31:16.420
<v Speaker 13>That was a,</v>

5362
02:31:16.421 --> 02:31:17.270
<v Speaker 13>a good friend of his,</v>

5363
02:31:17.271 --> 02:31:18.104
<v Speaker 13>and I remember that was a,</v>

5364
02:31:18.290 --> 02:31:20.400
<v Speaker 13>that was a big bummer when that guy killed himself.</v>

5365
02:31:22.650 --> 02:31:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Fucking depression,</v>

5366
02:31:24.001 --> 02:31:24.834
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5367
02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5368
02:31:25.800 --> 02:31:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Duncan Trussell explained to price and really good yesterday he was saying,</v>

5369
02:31:29.521 --> 02:31:29.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5370
02:31:29.821 --> 02:31:34.821
<v Speaker 1>imagine what it's like if you like did it just did a lot of ecstasy and you know</v>

5371
02:31:34.831 --> 02:31:35.371
<v Speaker 1>that feeling,</v>

5372
02:31:35.371 --> 02:31:37.620
<v Speaker 1>if you've ever done ecstasy the next day where your head is like,</v>

5373
02:31:37.650 --> 02:31:39.090
<v Speaker 1>fuck this,</v>

5374
02:31:39.091 --> 02:31:40.890
<v Speaker 1>what did I do?</v>

5375
02:31:40.891 --> 02:31:41.581
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

5376
02:31:41.581 --> 02:31:43.440
<v Speaker 1>my brain's drive feel like shit.</v>

5377
02:31:43.800 --> 02:31:45.780
<v Speaker 1>But you can get through it because you know it's not going to last.</v>

5378
02:31:45.840 --> 02:31:46.620
<v Speaker 1>But he said like,</v>

5379
02:31:46.620 --> 02:31:48.960
<v Speaker 1>imagine going through that for 10 years,</v>

5380
02:31:50.280 --> 02:31:50.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5381
02:31:50.730 --> 02:31:54.840
<v Speaker 1>imagine that feel and that's your reality every day for 10 years.</v>

5382
02:31:55.770 --> 02:31:56.730
<v Speaker 1>It sounds miserable.</v>

5383
02:31:56.731 --> 02:31:57.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what x is like.</v>

5384
02:31:58.830 --> 02:31:59.730
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>

5385
02:31:59.850 --> 02:32:00.001
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5386
02:32:00.001 --> 02:32:00.834
<v Speaker 1>it's good when you're on,</v>

5387
02:32:01.860 --> 02:32:02.281
<v Speaker 1>when you're off.</v>

5388
02:32:02.281 --> 02:32:03.114
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>

5389
02:32:03.390 --> 02:32:03.751
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

5390
02:32:03.751 --> 02:32:05.580
<v Speaker 1>I only did it once and I loved it,</v>

5391
02:32:06.090 --> 02:32:06.901
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>

5392
02:32:06.901 --> 02:32:11.880
<v Speaker 1>dad is not worth the juice is not worth the squeeze to me at least.</v>

5393
02:32:12.850 --> 02:32:13.680
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

5394
02:32:13.680 --> 02:32:16.230
<v Speaker 1>but also I wasn't taking five HTP.</v>

5395
02:32:16.231 --> 02:32:18.690
<v Speaker 1>Apparently if you take five HTP right afterwards,</v>

5396
02:32:18.691 --> 02:32:21.420
<v Speaker 1>it helps your brain a rebuild.</v>

5397
02:32:21.870 --> 02:32:24.420
<v Speaker 1>Do you take after you wake up after you take it?</v>

5398
02:32:24.421 --> 02:32:25.680
<v Speaker 1>I think he's supposed to take it like,</v>

5399
02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.820
<v Speaker 1>like in the middle of it so that like when you come out of it,</v>

5400
02:32:29.821 --> 02:32:30.170
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

5401
02:32:30.170 --> 02:32:33.540
<v Speaker 1>your body's already starting to crank up its production.</v>

5402
02:32:33.541 --> 02:32:36.120
<v Speaker 1>If that might be completely unscientific though.</v>

5403
02:32:36.300 --> 02:32:39.000
<v Speaker 1>But I do know that the five HTP is supposed to help you.</v>

5404
02:32:39.090 --> 02:32:42.180
<v Speaker 1>So you got get no sun x and they get each team.</v>

5405
02:32:43.680 --> 02:32:44.041
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5406
02:32:44.041 --> 02:32:47.820
<v Speaker 1>and that's obviously not the best description of depression either.</v>

5407
02:32:47.850 --> 02:32:48.880
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes people,</v>

5408
02:32:49.020 --> 02:32:51.000
<v Speaker 1>depression is social,</v>

5409
02:32:51.001 --> 02:32:52.680
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's from,</v>

5410
02:32:52.950 --> 02:32:54.030
<v Speaker 1>from life events.</v>

5411
02:32:54.031 --> 02:32:54.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5412
02:32:54.450 --> 02:32:55.020
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>

5413
02:32:55.020 --> 02:32:57.780
<v Speaker 1>who knows what's causing someone to feel like shit.</v>

5414
02:32:59.520 --> 02:33:00.540
<v Speaker 1>That guy was a good dude.</v>

5415
02:33:01.560 --> 02:33:02.760
<v Speaker 1>He seemed like a nice guy.</v>

5416
02:33:03.690 --> 02:33:05.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking of a different guy.</v>

5417
02:33:05.040 --> 02:33:08.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking of the guy who fought Nick Diaz.</v>

5418
02:33:08.761 --> 02:33:11.220
<v Speaker 1>He was the first guy to stop Nick Diaz and then he was on,</v>

5419
02:33:12.040 --> 02:33:13.800
<v Speaker 1>his name was Jeremy,</v>

5420
02:33:13.801 --> 02:33:14.820
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think it was willy.</v>

5421
02:33:14.830 --> 02:33:15.241
<v Speaker 1>Can you,</v>

5422
02:33:15.241 --> 02:33:15.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5423
02:33:15.660 --> 02:33:16.870
<v Speaker 1>think it was Jeremy Williams?</v>

5424
02:33:17.180 --> 02:33:19.770
<v Speaker 1>What I'm x talked about him is inside his name.</v>

5425
02:33:19.771 --> 02:33:20.130
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

5426
02:33:20.130 --> 02:33:21.030
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't picture of</v>

5427
02:33:22.770 --> 02:33:24.000
<v Speaker 1>the all season,</v>

5428
02:33:24.001 --> 02:33:26.670
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate fighter that Nick Diaz was on.</v>

5429
02:33:26.920 --> 02:33:30.030
<v Speaker 1>I think that Jeremy Jackson,</v>

5430
02:33:30.031 --> 02:33:30.990
<v Speaker 1>Jackson Sherman,</v>

5431
02:33:30.991 --> 02:33:31.471
<v Speaker 1>Jackson,</v>

5432
02:33:31.471 --> 02:33:32.304
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy Jackson,</v>

5433
02:33:32.310 --> 02:33:32.760
<v Speaker 1>Israel.</v>

5434
02:33:32.760 --> 02:33:33.181
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>

5435
02:33:33.181 --> 02:33:34.050
<v Speaker 1>was it Nate Diaz?</v>

5436
02:33:34.110 --> 02:33:35.070
<v Speaker 1>Nate Diaz is here.</v>

5437
02:33:35.190 --> 02:33:36.030
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't nick.</v>

5438
02:33:36.090 --> 02:33:36.271
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5439
02:33:36.271 --> 02:33:36.880
<v Speaker 1>nick fought.</v>

5440
02:33:36.880 --> 02:33:39.090
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't on the ultimate fighter.</v>

5441
02:33:39.390 --> 02:33:40.620
<v Speaker 1>Nate was on the ultimate fighter.</v>

5442
02:33:40.860 --> 02:33:42.060
<v Speaker 1>Goes on the ultimate fighter.</v>

5443
02:33:42.390 --> 02:33:43.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5444
02:33:43.050 --> 02:33:43.531
<v Speaker 1>I think it was.</v>

5445
02:33:43.531 --> 02:33:44.030
<v Speaker 1>He on was,</v>

5446
02:33:44.030 --> 02:33:44.130
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5447
02:33:44.130 --> 02:33:45.030
<v Speaker 1>it was in the UFC.</v>

5448
02:33:45.031 --> 02:33:46.170
<v Speaker 1>It was just in the UFC.</v>

5449
02:33:46.260 --> 02:33:47.810
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy was on the ultimate fighter.</v>

5450
02:33:47.811 --> 02:33:48.350
<v Speaker 1>Everybody got it.</v>

5451
02:33:48.350 --> 02:33:49.560
<v Speaker 1>Nick was him in the UFC,</v>

5452
02:33:49.561 --> 02:33:50.910
<v Speaker 1>but nick had fought him before.</v>

5453
02:33:50.911 --> 02:33:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5454
02:33:51.480 --> 02:33:51.991
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>

5455
02:33:51.991 --> 02:33:52.824
<v Speaker 1>This is the fight.</v>

5456
02:33:53.250 --> 02:33:57.960
<v Speaker 1>Nick Diaz vs Jeremy Jackson at IFC warriors challenge 18.</v>

5457
02:33:58.680 --> 02:33:59.041
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

5458
02:33:59.041 --> 02:34:00.180
<v Speaker 1>What year was that?</v>

5459
02:34:01.980 --> 02:34:02.281
<v Speaker 1>Play?</v>

5460
02:34:02.281 --> 02:34:03.114
<v Speaker 1>That shit.</v>

5461
02:34:03.150 --> 02:34:03.810
<v Speaker 1>That was his,</v>

5462
02:34:03.810 --> 02:34:08.640
<v Speaker 1>that was his claim to claim to fame on the show that him and Nick Diaz had that</v>

5463
02:34:08.641 --> 02:34:09.474
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

5464
02:34:09.600 --> 02:34:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy Jackson.</v>

5465
02:34:11.130 --> 02:34:11.821
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

5466
02:34:11.821 --> 02:34:13.560
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy Jackson had nasty hands,</v>

5467
02:34:13.561 --> 02:34:13.771
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5468
02:34:13.771 --> 02:34:15.150
<v Speaker 1>He was a really good boxer.</v>

5469
02:34:15.820 --> 02:34:16.360
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5470
02:34:16.360 --> 02:34:16.651
<v Speaker 1>Nick.</v>

5471
02:34:16.651 --> 02:34:17.484
<v Speaker 1>One time.</v>

5472
02:34:17.710 --> 02:34:21.160
<v Speaker 1>I asked Nick one time who is the hardest silver hidden and uh,</v>

5473
02:34:21.550 --> 02:34:23.890
<v Speaker 1>he said he didn't say who hit him the hardest.</v>

5474
02:34:23.891 --> 02:34:26.240
<v Speaker 1>He just said that Jeremy Jackson hit me.</v>

5475
02:34:26.440 --> 02:34:27.191
<v Speaker 1>Hit hard as fuck.</v>

5476
02:34:27.191 --> 02:34:28.470
<v Speaker 1>See if you watch like his,</v>

5477
02:34:28.510 --> 02:34:29.590
<v Speaker 1>his striking here.</v>

5478
02:34:29.591 --> 02:34:30.424
<v Speaker 1>He was good.</v>

5479
02:34:30.480 --> 02:34:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5480
02:34:30.730 --> 02:34:33.610
<v Speaker 1>He was a good boxer and they were both super young.</v>

5481
02:34:33.670 --> 02:34:35.200
<v Speaker 1>I think nick was 18,</v>

5482
02:34:37.630 --> 02:34:38.830
<v Speaker 1>if I remember right.</v>

5483
02:34:39.280 --> 02:34:39.551
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

5484
02:34:39.551 --> 02:34:41.110
<v Speaker 1>it was close to it at least.</v>

5485
02:34:42.130 --> 02:34:44.020
<v Speaker 1>I think they were both pretty young hair man.</v>

5486
02:34:44.650 --> 02:34:45.370
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

5487
02:34:45.370 --> 02:34:46.540
<v Speaker 1>and then nick went on to,</v>

5488
02:34:46.541 --> 02:34:50.680
<v Speaker 1>I think nick beat him by submission and beat them by decision.</v>

5489
02:34:50.681 --> 02:34:51.940
<v Speaker 1>Did he find them three times?</v>

5490
02:34:52.030 --> 02:34:53.380
<v Speaker 1>I think they had a trilogy.</v>

5491
02:34:53.800 --> 02:34:54.700
<v Speaker 1>I think nick warm,</v>

5492
02:34:54.701 --> 02:34:55.534
<v Speaker 1>although,</v>

5493
02:34:55.630 --> 02:34:55.991
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5494
02:34:55.991 --> 02:34:56.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

5495
02:34:56.320 --> 02:34:57.550
<v Speaker 1>I think Jeremy stopped him.</v>

5496
02:34:57.870 --> 02:34:58.390
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

5497
02:34:58.390 --> 02:35:00.190
<v Speaker 1>I think he stopped him in this fight.</v>

5498
02:35:00.220 --> 02:35:02.860
<v Speaker 1>I think this was the first fight that nick ever lost.</v>

5499
02:35:04.300 --> 02:35:04.841
<v Speaker 1>I think this is the,</v>

5500
02:35:04.841 --> 02:35:07.000
<v Speaker 1>actually the only time the naked ever been stopped.</v>

5501
02:35:08.690 --> 02:35:09.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5502
02:35:09.520 --> 02:35:09.851
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

5503
02:35:09.851 --> 02:35:10.031
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5504
02:35:10.031 --> 02:35:13.750
<v Speaker 1>I had heard some crazy rumor that I'd hoped was true that they were going to try</v>

5505
02:35:13.751 --> 02:35:15.400
<v Speaker 1>to set up nick versus Connor.</v>

5506
02:35:17.500 --> 02:35:17.921
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

5507
02:35:17.921 --> 02:35:18.581
<v Speaker 1>my God,</v>

5508
02:35:18.581 --> 02:35:20.530
<v Speaker 1>that would break the world.</v>

5509
02:35:20.890 --> 02:35:25.890
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how like insane the hype would be for a Nick Diaz versus Conor</v>

5510
02:35:26.170 --> 02:35:26.860
<v Speaker 1>Mcgregor fight?</v>

5511
02:35:26.860 --> 02:35:27.011
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5512
02:35:27.011 --> 02:35:27.844
<v Speaker 1>could we even,</v>

5513
02:35:28.180 --> 02:35:30.700
<v Speaker 1>can you even imagine how crazy that would be?</v>

5514
02:35:31.540 --> 02:35:32.141
<v Speaker 1>So good that,</v>

5515
02:35:32.141 --> 02:35:34.630
<v Speaker 1>that that would be like the sequel to,</v>

5516
02:35:34.660 --> 02:35:35.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

5517
02:35:35.710 --> 02:35:36.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5518
02:35:36.051 --> 02:35:38.680
<v Speaker 1>a much better bigger my God Avengers movie.</v>

5519
02:35:38.710 --> 02:35:40.240
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if they do that?</v>

5520
02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:41.561
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5521
02:35:41.561 --> 02:35:41.860
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

5522
02:35:41.860 --> 02:35:44.710
<v Speaker 1>the thing is a nick has never making one 55 again.</v>

5523
02:35:44.740 --> 02:35:45.460
<v Speaker 1>He's just not,</v>

5524
02:35:45.460 --> 02:35:46.360
<v Speaker 1>he's way too big.</v>

5525
02:35:46.540 --> 02:35:47.200
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

5526
02:35:47.200 --> 02:35:48.190
<v Speaker 1>he didn't think he could do it.</v>

5527
02:35:48.191 --> 02:35:49.120
<v Speaker 1>He could absolutely do it.</v>

5528
02:35:49.410 --> 02:35:50.243
<v Speaker 1>He's not that big.</v>

5529
02:35:50.980 --> 02:35:51.581
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

5530
02:35:51.581 --> 02:35:52.180
<v Speaker 1>He looks,</v>

5531
02:35:52.180 --> 02:35:52.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5532
02:35:52.550 --> 02:35:53.920
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't look small.</v>

5533
02:35:54.940 --> 02:35:55.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5534
02:35:55.330 --> 02:35:57.400
<v Speaker 1>he's going to have to lose [inaudible] amount of bonds.</v>

5535
02:35:57.430 --> 02:35:59.320
<v Speaker 1>60 I don't think he's ever at eight 55.</v>

5536
02:35:59.350 --> 02:35:59.800
<v Speaker 1>That's one.</v>

5537
02:35:59.800 --> 02:36:01.990
<v Speaker 1>1655 of the UFC.</v>

5538
02:36:02.170 --> 02:36:05.070
<v Speaker 1>I think he fought 55 against Diego Sanchez.</v>

5539
02:36:05.400 --> 02:36:06.233
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5540
02:36:06.530 --> 02:36:08.320
<v Speaker 1>I think they could say,</v>

5541
02:36:08.440 --> 02:36:11.070
<v Speaker 1>could leave one thing niggas ever funded.</v>

5542
02:36:11.080 --> 02:36:12.210
<v Speaker 1>55 yes.</v>

5543
02:36:12.280 --> 02:36:12.461
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5544
02:36:12.461 --> 02:36:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Nick fought at 55.</v>

5545
02:36:14.020 --> 02:36:14.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5546
02:36:14.590 --> 02:36:15.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5547
02:36:15.160 --> 02:36:16.570
<v Speaker 1>Make Fun of 55 I believe you.</v>

5548
02:36:16.571 --> 02:36:16.791
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

5549
02:36:16.791 --> 02:36:19.060
<v Speaker 1>Go me if 55 or do you fight him at 60?</v>

5550
02:36:19.210 --> 02:36:20.320
<v Speaker 1>He fought Gomi at 60.</v>

5551
02:36:20.360 --> 02:36:20.800
<v Speaker 1>60.</v>

5552
02:36:20.800 --> 02:36:21.580
<v Speaker 1>That was pride.</v>

5553
02:36:21.580 --> 02:36:22.840
<v Speaker 1>What a fight that was.</v>

5554
02:36:23.050 --> 02:36:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>

5555
02:36:24.580 --> 02:36:26.110
<v Speaker 1>That was crazy.</v>

5556
02:36:26.111 --> 02:36:26.780
<v Speaker 1>That was when gum,</v>

5557
02:36:26.780 --> 02:36:28.390
<v Speaker 1>he was going to go me,</v>

5558
02:36:28.391 --> 02:36:29.980
<v Speaker 1>it was just knocking dude's dead.</v>

5559
02:36:30.580 --> 02:36:32.050
<v Speaker 1>And Nick took some bombs.</v>

5560
02:36:32.051 --> 02:36:35.260
<v Speaker 1>He had that big ass cut on his cheek and he locked up that Gogal Plata.</v>

5561
02:36:35.650 --> 02:36:36.790
<v Speaker 1>He fought a lot of,</v>

5562
02:36:36.990 --> 02:36:38.950
<v Speaker 1>when we were training for the Anderson,</v>

5563
02:36:39.190 --> 02:36:39.971
<v Speaker 1>I was looking over his,</v>

5564
02:36:39.971 --> 02:36:42.060
<v Speaker 1>figured he's fought a lot of hitters like in there,</v>

5565
02:36:42.070 --> 02:36:45.400
<v Speaker 1>like fucking probably knock him the fuck out of people.</v>

5566
02:36:45.400 --> 02:36:45.670
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

5567
02:36:45.670 --> 02:36:45.881
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

5568
02:36:45.881 --> 02:36:46.720
<v Speaker 1>let's match him up.</v>

5569
02:36:47.190 --> 02:36:48.340
<v Speaker 1>That was Nick's opponent.</v>

5570
02:36:48.610 --> 02:36:50.500
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember when nick knocked out Robbie Lawler?</v>

5571
02:36:51.520 --> 02:36:54.040
<v Speaker 1>So we were in the same locker room that night.</v>

5572
02:36:54.430 --> 02:36:55.263
<v Speaker 1>Nick and I,</v>

5573
02:36:55.510 --> 02:36:56.343
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

5574
02:36:56.770 --> 02:37:01.770
<v Speaker 1>he was hitting pads with my co with his coach and he was,</v>

5575
02:37:02.710 --> 02:37:03.790
<v Speaker 1>he was being nick.</v>

5576
02:37:03.820 --> 02:37:06.790
<v Speaker 1>He's back to hitting pads is early in when he was boxing.</v>

5577
02:37:06.791 --> 02:37:09.520
<v Speaker 1>So his boxing has gotten much better over time,</v>

5578
02:37:09.760 --> 02:37:10.630
<v Speaker 1>but he was hitting pads.</v>

5579
02:37:10.631 --> 02:37:11.710
<v Speaker 1>It didn't look awesome.</v>

5580
02:37:11.950 --> 02:37:12.783
<v Speaker 1>And he was just,</v>

5581
02:37:12.930 --> 02:37:14.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm a knock this mother fucking out.</v>

5582
02:37:14.500 --> 02:37:15.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5583
02:37:15.260 --> 02:37:16.093
<v Speaker 1>it's right.</v>

5584
02:37:16.500 --> 02:37:19.340
<v Speaker 1>Just get just pumping himself up in the back talking about how he's going to</v>

5585
02:37:19.341 --> 02:37:20.900
<v Speaker 1>knock or I'll be out and do all this shit.</v>

5586
02:37:20.901 --> 02:37:21.591
<v Speaker 1>And I was just like,</v>

5587
02:37:21.591 --> 02:37:22.710
<v Speaker 1>he ain't knocking out nothing.</v>

5588
02:37:22.730 --> 02:37:23.720
<v Speaker 1>All those bunches.</v>

5589
02:37:24.350 --> 02:37:26.630
<v Speaker 1>And then he went out there and knocked him out with a jab.</v>

5590
02:37:27.360 --> 02:37:29.420
<v Speaker 1>What was kind of like a little like a hook.</v>

5591
02:37:30.150 --> 02:37:31.820
<v Speaker 1>A short long hook.</v>

5592
02:37:31.850 --> 02:37:32.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5593
02:37:32.510 --> 02:37:33.690
<v Speaker 1>With the lead AOL.</v>

5594
02:37:33.740 --> 02:37:34.491
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

5595
02:37:34.491 --> 02:37:34.851
<v Speaker 1>Short,</v>

5596
02:37:34.851 --> 02:37:35.611
<v Speaker 1>Long Hook with the little,</v>

5597
02:37:35.611 --> 02:37:35.841
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5598
02:37:35.841 --> 02:37:37.130
<v Speaker 1>it was like a straight arm,</v>

5599
02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:39.020
<v Speaker 1>but it was like a little pop to it.</v>

5600
02:37:39.820 --> 02:37:40.653
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

5601
02:37:40.700 --> 02:37:41.533
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

5602
02:37:41.810 --> 02:37:43.400
<v Speaker 1>I was taken aback dude.</v>

5603
02:37:43.401 --> 02:37:46.250
<v Speaker 1>He was talking so much shit before that fight to this day I've said that that</v>

5604
02:37:46.251 --> 02:37:51.170
<v Speaker 1>was one of the most interesting things that I've seen as a commentator is like</v>

5605
02:37:51.171 --> 02:37:54.830
<v Speaker 1>there's reactions that people have to certain things and sometimes it's</v>

5606
02:37:54.831 --> 02:37:55.880
<v Speaker 1>psychological shit.</v>

5607
02:37:55.930 --> 02:37:56.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5608
02:37:56.210 --> 02:37:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes there's these crazy moments where people like Rhonda Rousey</v>

5609
02:37:59.960 --> 02:38:01.280
<v Speaker 1>Gotten Holly Holmes face and it was like,</v>

5610
02:38:01.281 --> 02:38:01.721
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

5611
02:38:01.721 --> 02:38:02.061
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

5612
02:38:02.061 --> 02:38:03.110
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on?</v>

5613
02:38:03.410 --> 02:38:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Like there's moments where you see in fights where you can do,</v>

5614
02:38:07.520 --> 02:38:09.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean don't you feel like that there's,</v>

5615
02:38:09.620 --> 02:38:10.130
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5616
02:38:10.130 --> 02:38:14.210
<v Speaker 1>there are times when shit like that happens where you just see that someone,</v>

5617
02:38:14.240 --> 02:38:14.451
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

5618
02:38:14.451 --> 02:38:15.260
<v Speaker 1>you see it,</v>

5619
02:38:15.260 --> 02:38:17.300
<v Speaker 1>you see who they really are for a split second.</v>

5620
02:38:17.360 --> 02:38:18.260
<v Speaker 1>What you see these,</v>

5621
02:38:18.261 --> 02:38:18.860
<v Speaker 1>see these,</v>

5622
02:38:18.860 --> 02:38:22.730
<v Speaker 1>there's this weird moments when you see someone affected by shit talking.</v>

5623
02:38:22.760 --> 02:38:27.440
<v Speaker 1>And Nick got into the cage with Robbie Lawler and you start to go on Stockton</v>

5624
02:38:27.441 --> 02:38:31.520
<v Speaker 1>mother fucker stocked and mother fucker and Robbie Lara's like,</v>

5626
02:38:33.560 --> 02:38:35.780
<v Speaker 1>Because Robbie's like a pretty mellow dude,</v>

5627
02:38:35.900 --> 02:38:36.421
<v Speaker 1>like Robbie,</v>

5628
02:38:36.421 --> 02:38:37.280
<v Speaker 1>super violent.</v>

5629
02:38:37.281 --> 02:38:38.900
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people think he's the Boogie man.</v>

5630
02:38:39.120 --> 02:38:41.540
<v Speaker 1>Like people are scared of Robbie cause he's so violent.</v>

5631
02:38:41.541 --> 02:38:44.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's a incredibly aggressive fighter.</v>

5634
02:38:46.190 --> 02:38:47.450
<v Speaker 1>But you could see Robbie was like,</v>

02:38:54.200 --> 02:38:55.490
<v Speaker 1>And then he's standing in and he's going,</v>

5645
02:39:01.100 --> 02:39:01.731
<v Speaker 1>And you could see,</v>

5646
02:39:01.731 --> 02:39:04.400
<v Speaker 1>you could see like the effect it was happening.</v>

02:39:07.580 --> 02:39:08.660
<v Speaker 1>Nick was only 20</v>

5652
02:39:10.160 --> 02:39:10.670
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5653
02:39:10.670 --> 02:39:14.960
<v Speaker 1>People forget how fucking young he was when he was fighting at a really high</v>

02:39:15.831 --> 02:39:18.980
<v Speaker 1>Bruce buffer is like you went into a time machine</v>

5657
02:39:20.840 --> 02:39:21.650
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

5658
02:39:21.650 --> 02:39:24.980
<v Speaker 1>nick came out and from the moment the fight started,</v>

5659
02:39:24.981 --> 02:39:27.140
<v Speaker 1>he's just talking mad shit.</v>

5660
02:39:29.180 --> 02:39:29.751
<v Speaker 1>He's pretty yoke.</v>

5661
02:39:29.751 --> 02:39:34.340
<v Speaker 1>Then he had that one giant advantage.</v>

5662
02:39:34.700 --> 02:39:37.310
<v Speaker 1>Not just like being tough and being crazy like those,</v>

5663
02:39:37.311 --> 02:39:38.000
<v Speaker 1>those were good.</v>

5664
02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.400
<v Speaker 1>He had a real good ground game that people would sleep on.</v>

5665
02:39:40.670 --> 02:39:41.660
<v Speaker 1>That was big too.</v>

5666
02:39:42.350 --> 02:39:44.420
<v Speaker 1>But it's fucking pace man.</v>

5667
02:39:44.720 --> 02:39:45.950
<v Speaker 1>His endurance,</v>

02:39:46.820 --> 02:39:49.790
<v Speaker 1>his endurance is insane and his pace is constant.</v>

5669
02:39:49.970 --> 02:39:51.260
<v Speaker 1>He's never breaks.</v>

5670
02:39:51.710 --> 02:39:52.160
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

02:39:53.210 --> 02:39:54.260
<v Speaker 1>And it's incredible.</v>

5692
02:40:32.581 --> 02:40:37.581
<v Speaker 11>I said on a podcast once that he had swam back and forth from a Alcatraz</v>

<v Speaker 11>Alcatraz twice.</v>

02:41:04.230 --> 02:41:09.230
<v Speaker 11>that is shark infested water that is legitimately 100% shark infested water.</v>

5713
02:41:11.040 --> 02:41:12.030
<v Speaker 11>You're not just swimming,</v>

5714
02:41:12.031 --> 02:41:16.740
<v Speaker 11>you're swimming through the habitat of one of the great monsters of earth who he</v>

5715
02:41:16.741 --> 02:41:17.930
<v Speaker 11>just clipped him with a right hand there.</v>

5716
02:41:25.320 --> 02:41:26.880
<v Speaker 11>This was such an interesting fight,</v>

5717
02:41:26.881 --> 02:41:27.420
<v Speaker 11>man,</v>

5718
02:41:27.420 --> 02:41:31.890
<v Speaker 11>who was such an interesting fight because I thought of nick before this fight as</v>

5719
02:41:31.891 --> 02:41:33.910
<v Speaker 11>really a Jujitsu guy.</v>

5720
02:41:33.930 --> 02:41:35.490
<v Speaker 11>I didn't think of him as a striker.</v>

5721
02:41:35.930 --> 02:41:36.691
<v Speaker 11>That same here.</v>

5722
02:41:36.691 --> 02:41:39.240
<v Speaker 11>That's why I was thinking when he said he was gonna knock this move.</v>

5723
02:41:39.241 --> 02:41:40.074
<v Speaker 11>Who the hell?</v>

5724
02:41:40.280 --> 02:41:41.190
<v Speaker 11>I was like,</v>

5725
02:41:41.610 --> 02:41:44.710
<v Speaker 11>we started getting really good at boxing when he went over to strike for us.</v>

5726
02:41:44.820 --> 02:41:45.740
<v Speaker 11>The strike force,</v>

5727
02:41:45.760 --> 02:41:45.990
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>

5763
02:42:39.930 --> 02:42:42.750
<v Speaker 11>This is a fun time capsule,</v>

5772
02:42:57.210 --> 02:42:59.230
<v Speaker 11>before he circled in that dude.</v>

02:43:07.481 --> 02:43:08.030
<v Speaker 11>Really?</v>

5777
02:43:08.030 --> 02:43:10.330
<v Speaker 11>That was where people got excited about them.</v>

5778
02:43:11.230 --> 02:43:11.730
<v Speaker 11>I roll,</v>

5779
02:43:11.730 --> 02:43:12.270
<v Speaker 11>I</v>

5780
02:43:12.270 --> 02:43:15.310
<v Speaker 13>rolled with Nate for the first time during that,</v>

5781
02:43:15.330 --> 02:43:15.700
<v Speaker 13>um,</v>

5782
02:43:15.700 --> 02:43:17.830
<v Speaker 13>that fight week was there with nick.</v>

5783
02:43:17.831 --> 02:43:18.880
<v Speaker 13>I just remember it now.</v>

5784
02:43:19.060 --> 02:43:19.900
<v Speaker 13>Nate was there with nick.</v>

5785
02:43:19.901 --> 02:43:20.471
<v Speaker 13>I went down,</v>

5786
02:43:20.471 --> 02:43:20.801
<v Speaker 13>I didn't,</v>

5787
02:43:20.801 --> 02:43:24.310
<v Speaker 13>my team wasn't there for awhile and I went down to the workout room.</v>

5788
02:43:24.400 --> 02:43:26.620
<v Speaker 13>I was just jumping rope and nick was like,</v>

5789
02:43:27.580 --> 02:43:28.413
<v Speaker 13>hey man,</v>

5790
02:43:28.450 --> 02:43:29.470
<v Speaker 13>that's all you're going to do.</v>

5791
02:43:29.650 --> 02:43:30.101
<v Speaker 13>I was like,</v>

5792
02:43:30.101 --> 02:43:30.251
<v Speaker 13>yeah,</v>

5793
02:43:30.251 --> 02:43:31.240
<v Speaker 13>my team's not here yet.</v>

5794
02:43:31.241 --> 02:43:31.571
<v Speaker 13>He's like,</v>

5795
02:43:31.571 --> 02:43:34.330
<v Speaker 13>you want someone to rule with is my brother's here.</v>

5796
02:43:34.390 --> 02:43:37.780
<v Speaker 13>So I wrote with Nick and Nate and um,</v>

5797
02:43:37.990 --> 02:43:38.711
<v Speaker 13>he's really good.</v>

5798
02:43:38.711 --> 02:43:42.310
<v Speaker 13>Then he was like 17 he's really good though.</v>

5799
02:43:43.120 --> 02:43:43.800
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

5800
02:43:43.800 --> 02:43:47.410
<v Speaker 13>Do you don't see their ground game dot often cause they're,</v>

5801
02:43:47.440 --> 02:43:52.440
<v Speaker 13>they like to strike like the entire last fight with Conor was an almost entirely</v>

5802
02:43:53.050 --> 02:43:53.980
<v Speaker 13>stand up fight.</v>

5803
02:43:54.490 --> 02:43:55.211
<v Speaker 13>But when you see him,</v>

5804
02:43:55.211 --> 02:43:56.410
<v Speaker 13>when he gets guys to the ground,</v>

5805
02:43:56.560 --> 02:43:58.020
<v Speaker 13>like the way you went through Connor,</v>

5806
02:43:58.021 --> 02:44:00.400
<v Speaker 13>that that whole sequence of beating them up,</v>

5807
02:44:00.401 --> 02:44:03.940
<v Speaker 13>taking his back and choking him does very sharp.</v>

5808
02:44:04.070 --> 02:44:04.690
<v Speaker 13>It's not,</v>

5809
02:44:04.690 --> 02:44:05.380
<v Speaker 13>there's no room,</v>

5810
02:44:05.380 --> 02:44:06.340
<v Speaker 13>there's no fat in there.</v>

5811
02:44:06.370 --> 02:44:07.203
<v Speaker 13>It's no room in there.</v>

5812
02:44:07.660 --> 02:44:09.130
<v Speaker 13>And you can see it.</v>

5813
02:44:09.131 --> 02:44:09.761
<v Speaker 13>It was for him,</v>

5814
02:44:09.761 --> 02:44:10.451
<v Speaker 13>it was flawless.</v>

5815
02:44:10.451 --> 02:44:10.861
<v Speaker 13>It was just,</v>

5816
02:44:10.861 --> 02:44:11.210
<v Speaker 13>it was,</v>

5817
02:44:11.210 --> 02:44:12.850
<v Speaker 13>he'd done that a million times before.</v>

5818
02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:15.610
<v Speaker 13>He has ten thousand ten thousand hours of that.</v>

5819
02:44:16.170 --> 02:44:16.300
<v Speaker 13>Oh,</v>

5820
02:44:16.300 --> 02:44:17.260
<v Speaker 13>a hundred percent yeah.</v>

5821
02:44:17.950 --> 02:44:18.161
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

5822
02:44:18.161 --> 02:44:18.530
<v Speaker 13>And then,</v>

5823
02:44:18.530 --> 02:44:20.620
<v Speaker 13>and there's really almost no substitute for that,</v>

5824
02:44:21.520 --> 02:44:22.353
<v Speaker 13>but</v>

5825
02:44:24.230 --> 02:44:27.040
<v Speaker 13>there's so many fucking good fights to be made now.</v>

5826
02:44:27.310 --> 02:44:27.581
<v Speaker 13>I mean,</v>

5827
02:44:27.581 --> 02:44:32.280
<v Speaker 13>nobody's even talking about Michael Johnson is going to fight men off Michael</v>

5828
02:44:32.280 --> 02:44:32.290
<v Speaker 13>Johnson's.</v>

5829
02:44:32.290 --> 02:44:33.123
<v Speaker 13>Right.</v>

5830
02:44:34.180 --> 02:44:35.050
<v Speaker 13>That's exciting.</v>

5831
02:44:35.680 --> 02:44:37.360
<v Speaker 13>So that's exciting.</v>

5832
02:44:37.990 --> 02:44:42.310
<v Speaker 13>This is the first time when the UFC as has put together a card to the two oh</v>

5833
02:44:42.311 --> 02:44:44.290
<v Speaker 13>five card for me.</v>

5834
02:44:44.620 --> 02:44:47.830
<v Speaker 13>Like in my personal opinion that when they hit pipe,</v>

5835
02:44:47.831 --> 02:44:49.090
<v Speaker 13>it is the biggest card ever.</v>

5836
02:44:49.420 --> 02:44:49.780
<v Speaker 13>I'm like,</v>

5837
02:44:49.780 --> 02:44:50.350
<v Speaker 13>yeah,</v>

5838
02:44:50.350 --> 02:44:50.681
<v Speaker 13>I mean,</v>

5839
02:44:50.681 --> 02:44:50.951
<v Speaker 13>yeah,</v>

5840
02:44:50.951 --> 02:44:51.490
<v Speaker 13>this is,</v>

5841
02:44:51.490 --> 02:44:52.720
<v Speaker 13>this is the biggest card ever,</v>

5842
02:44:52.721 --> 02:44:55.690
<v Speaker 13>but there's like four or two or three good fights on it.</v>

5843
02:44:55.810 --> 02:44:57.100
<v Speaker 13>Like to be big fights.</v>

5844
02:44:57.101 --> 02:44:57.701
<v Speaker 13>This card,</v>

5845
02:44:57.701 --> 02:45:01.240
<v Speaker 13>every single fight on this card could main event and a shill.</v>

5846
02:45:01.270 --> 02:45:01.900
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

5847
02:45:01.900 --> 02:45:04.510
<v Speaker 13>Like whether it be a fight night or whatever,</v>

5848
02:45:04.570 --> 02:45:06.880
<v Speaker 13>every fight on this card can mean of any show.</v>

5849
02:45:06.940 --> 02:45:07.773
<v Speaker 13>It really could.</v>

5850
02:45:07.900 --> 02:45:08.740
<v Speaker 13>It's crazy.</v>

5851
02:45:08.830 --> 02:45:09.160
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

5852
02:45:09.160 --> 02:45:09.730
<v Speaker 13>It's an,</v>

5853
02:45:09.730 --> 02:45:10.720
<v Speaker 13>it's a nutty card.</v>

5854
02:45:11.140 --> 02:45:14.260
<v Speaker 13>There's three world title fights and there's so many great fights.</v>

5855
02:45:14.261 --> 02:45:15.970
<v Speaker 13>Like the number of growing off Johnson fight.</v>

5856
02:45:16.780 --> 02:45:17.650
<v Speaker 13>Rashad is fine.</v>

5857
02:45:17.651 --> 02:45:18.600
<v Speaker 13>10 Kennedy,</v>

5858
02:45:19.640 --> 02:45:21.850
<v Speaker 13>there's a lot of good fights on that card.</v>

5859
02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:23.140
<v Speaker 13>Tiago Alvarez.</v>

5860
02:45:23.170 --> 02:45:23.890
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

5861
02:45:23.890 --> 02:45:24.401
<v Speaker 13>Whose Shadow?</v>

5862
02:45:24.401 --> 02:45:25.234
<v Speaker 13>Fighting again?</v>

5863
02:45:25.510 --> 02:45:26.860
<v Speaker 13>He was supposed to fight I Quinta.</v>

5864
02:45:26.880 --> 02:45:27.641
<v Speaker 13>They changed it.</v>

5865
02:45:27.641 --> 02:45:28.474
<v Speaker 13>That's right.</v>

5866
02:45:28.540 --> 02:45:28.931
<v Speaker 13>But who,</v>

5867
02:45:28.931 --> 02:45:29.081
<v Speaker 13>uh,</v>

5868
02:45:29.081 --> 02:45:30.510
<v Speaker 13>who replaced yet?</v>

5869
02:45:31.150 --> 02:45:31.983
<v Speaker 13>Here it is.</v>

5870
02:45:32.480 --> 02:45:33.313
<v Speaker 13>Where is it?</v>

5871
02:45:33.520 --> 02:45:34.560
<v Speaker 13>Where's Tiago office?</v>

5872
02:45:34.590 --> 02:45:35.423
<v Speaker 13>Oh,</v>

5873
02:45:36.490 --> 02:45:36.941
<v Speaker 13>that's good.</v>

5874
02:45:36.941 --> 02:45:37.760
<v Speaker 13>To Hell.</v>

5875
02:45:37.760 --> 02:45:40.000
<v Speaker 13>That might be just as good that,</v>

5876
02:45:40.001 --> 02:45:40.834
<v Speaker 13>um,</v>

5877
02:45:40.960 --> 02:45:42.430
<v Speaker 13>I hated hearing that though.</v>

5878
02:45:42.460 --> 02:45:43.780
<v Speaker 13>That ally acquainted thing.</v>

5879
02:45:45.490 --> 02:45:45.860
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

5880
02:45:45.860 --> 02:45:46.693
<v Speaker 13>That was a bummer.</v>

5881
02:45:46.990 --> 02:45:47.690
<v Speaker 13>You know,</v>

5882
02:45:47.690 --> 02:45:49.180
<v Speaker 13>I don't know what the full story is.</v>

5883
02:45:49.510 --> 02:45:50.343
<v Speaker 13>I don't know either,</v>

5884
02:45:51.760 --> 02:45:55.060
<v Speaker 13>but I'm a fan of I aquanto he's a fun dude to watch.</v>

5885
02:45:56.260 --> 02:45:57.520
<v Speaker 13>There's a lot of guys out there.</v>

5886
02:45:57.550 --> 02:45:58.383
<v Speaker 13>I mean</v>

5887
02:45:59.680 --> 02:46:00.730
<v Speaker 13>it's crazy because this,</v>

5888
02:46:00.731 --> 02:46:01.211
<v Speaker 13>this is,</v>

5889
02:46:01.211 --> 02:46:03.480
<v Speaker 13>I feel this is the first generation of,</v>

5890
02:46:03.540 --> 02:46:06.640
<v Speaker 13>of guys that have come up as MMA fighters the whole time,</v>

5891
02:46:06.980 --> 02:46:07.813
<v Speaker 13>the whole way through.</v>

5892
02:46:08.670 --> 02:46:11.270
<v Speaker 13>Even even Nate being as young as he is,</v>

5893
02:46:11.271 --> 02:46:11.960
<v Speaker 13>he still,</v>

5894
02:46:11.960 --> 02:46:14.600
<v Speaker 13>he was still a Jujitsu guy coming into this,</v>

5895
02:46:15.700 --> 02:46:18.890
<v Speaker 13>but there are these kids now that a fight like Mossad backtick.</v>

5896
02:46:18.891 --> 02:46:22.370
<v Speaker 13>I feel like Massaad is one of those guys that he started training MMA.</v>

5897
02:46:23.600 --> 02:46:24.433
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

5898
02:46:25.730 --> 02:46:27.080
<v Speaker 13>And when you're doing that,</v>

5899
02:46:27.110 --> 02:46:29.810
<v Speaker 13>how important is it to find the right coach?</v>

5900
02:46:29.811 --> 02:46:32.210
<v Speaker 13>The right coach is so valuable.</v>

5901
02:46:32.290 --> 02:46:33.020
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

5902
02:46:33.020 --> 02:46:37.490
<v Speaker 13>Because how many guys can give you that full sort of for Rasa Hobby,</v>

5903
02:46:37.640 --> 02:46:42.230
<v Speaker 13>Matt Hume sort of experience or they've got black belt level or Jujitsu,</v>

5904
02:46:42.350 --> 02:46:43.940
<v Speaker 13>like real worldclass striking.</v>

5905
02:46:43.940 --> 02:46:47.870
<v Speaker 13>They really know what the fuck they're doing and they understand the game deep,</v>

5906
02:46:47.930 --> 02:46:48.763
<v Speaker 13>deep in and out.</v>

5907
02:46:48.950 --> 02:46:49.370
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

5908
02:46:49.370 --> 02:46:54.170
<v Speaker 13>There's only a small amount of those guys and it's not a coincidence that like</v>

5909
02:46:54.190 --> 02:46:54.390
<v Speaker 13>the,</v>

5910
02:46:54.390 --> 02:46:59.390
<v Speaker 13>the great ones like Demetrius Demean Demetrius gives up all of his credit to</v>

5911
02:46:59.631 --> 02:47:00.410
<v Speaker 13>Matt Hume.</v>

5912
02:47:00.410 --> 02:47:00.771
<v Speaker 13>You know,</v>

5913
02:47:00.771 --> 02:47:05.771
<v Speaker 13>I mean it's like he found a guy who was a pioneer of the sport who was a real</v>

5914
02:47:06.861 --> 02:47:08.210
<v Speaker 13>high level Moy Thai guy,</v>

5915
02:47:08.420 --> 02:47:09.470
<v Speaker 13>real high level,</v>

5916
02:47:09.471 --> 02:47:14.471
<v Speaker 13>a a black male in Jujitsu and competed at a real high level in Japan.</v>

5917
02:47:14.661 --> 02:47:15.110
<v Speaker 13>He,</v>

5918
02:47:15.110 --> 02:47:16.780
<v Speaker 13>nobody fought well the fans.</v>

5919
02:47:18.070 --> 02:47:18.320
<v Speaker 13>Yeah,</v>

5920
02:47:18.320 --> 02:47:19.540
<v Speaker 13>but he um,</v>

5921
02:47:19.910 --> 02:47:23.960
<v Speaker 13>he fought pat Miletich remember that he stopped pat military in an MMA fight.</v>

5922
02:47:24.280 --> 02:47:27.020
<v Speaker 13>Like mad Hume in his day was a bad motherfucker.</v>

5923
02:47:27.350 --> 02:47:30.860
<v Speaker 13>So it only made sense that he would also become a great coach.</v>

5924
02:47:31.610 --> 02:47:34.010
<v Speaker 13>But how many of those guys are there like that?</v>

5925
02:47:34.040 --> 02:47:37.220
<v Speaker 13>Like that's got that kind of Matt Hume type experience and understanding of the</v>

5926
02:47:37.221 --> 02:47:37.670
<v Speaker 13>sport.</v>

5927
02:47:37.670 --> 02:47:39.230
<v Speaker 13>It's coming now now,</v>

5928
02:47:39.231 --> 02:47:39.620
<v Speaker 13>right?</v>

5929
02:47:39.620 --> 02:47:44.390
<v Speaker 13>Because of of guys from my generation like Dean Thomas and Mike Brown.</v>

5930
02:47:44.600 --> 02:47:45.111
<v Speaker 13>Right,</v>

5931
02:47:45.111 --> 02:47:45.261
<v Speaker 13>right,</v>

5932
02:47:45.261 --> 02:47:45.441
<v Speaker 13>right,</v>

5933
02:47:45.441 --> 02:47:46.010
<v Speaker 13>right.</v>

5934
02:47:46.010 --> 02:47:46.580
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

5935
02:47:46.580 --> 02:47:47.300
<v Speaker 13>Josh.</v>

5936
02:47:47.300 --> 02:47:49.280
<v Speaker 13>Josh Thompson is about to be retired.</v>

5937
02:47:49.920 --> 02:47:51.560
<v Speaker 13>He or he's closer to retirement.</v>

5938
02:47:51.561 --> 02:47:53.600
<v Speaker 13>Then some of these younger guys,</v>

5939
02:47:53.601 --> 02:47:54.434
<v Speaker 13>these guys are,</v>

5940
02:47:57.790 --> 02:47:58.160
<v Speaker 13>shoot,</v>

5941
02:47:58.160 --> 02:48:02.700
<v Speaker 13>there's so many guys now that at that point and this next generation of guys are</v>

5942
02:48:02.720 --> 02:48:07.420
<v Speaker 13>going to know they're not going to have to go to a Jujitsu gym and then to a</v>

5943
02:48:07.430 --> 02:48:08.600
<v Speaker 13>kickboxing place.</v>

5944
02:48:09.210 --> 02:48:12.830
<v Speaker 13>You know they're going to have these coaches that know the game that they are</v>

5945
02:48:12.831 --> 02:48:16.190
<v Speaker 13>teaching them mixed martial arts and not teaching them individual parts of it.</v>

5946
02:48:16.400 --> 02:48:19.010
<v Speaker 13>Don't you think there's still going to be specialized coaches though for each</v>

5947
02:48:19.011 --> 02:48:19.910
<v Speaker 13>individual thing?</v>

5948
02:48:19.940 --> 02:48:20.181
<v Speaker 13>Yeah,</v>

5949
02:48:20.181 --> 02:48:20.640
<v Speaker 13>for sure.</v>

5950
02:48:20.640 --> 02:48:25.640
<v Speaker 13>Because because those guys from that generation know that hey they,</v>

5951
02:48:25.970 --> 02:48:29.990
<v Speaker 13>they're good at it altogether but there are still parts of it that they are not,</v>

5952
02:48:30.160 --> 02:48:31.940
<v Speaker 13>their rating is not going to be a hundred.</v>

5953
02:48:32.030 --> 02:48:32.863
<v Speaker 13>Right.</v>

5954
02:48:32.900 --> 02:48:36.140
<v Speaker 13>Well like Duane Ludwig is probably a real good example of that because obviously</v>

5955
02:48:36.200 --> 02:48:36.590
<v Speaker 13>Dwayne,</v>

5956
02:48:36.590 --> 02:48:39.530
<v Speaker 13>Dwayne kickbox had a real high level.</v>

5957
02:48:39.531 --> 02:48:39.820
<v Speaker 13>He,</v>

5958
02:48:39.820 --> 02:48:44.750
<v Speaker 13>he's excellent MMA fighter and when you watch like what he's coaching,</v>

5959
02:48:44.751 --> 02:48:45.890
<v Speaker 13>he's primarily coaching,</v>

5960
02:48:45.891 --> 02:48:46.660
<v Speaker 13>striking,</v>

5961
02:48:46.660 --> 02:48:46.880
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

5962
02:48:46.880 --> 02:48:48.740
<v Speaker 13>he understands ground game very well.</v>

5963
02:48:48.800 --> 02:48:50.000
<v Speaker 13>I mean he did submit people,</v>

5964
02:48:50.001 --> 02:48:52.250
<v Speaker 13>I don't know what is Brazilian Jiu Jitsu belt is,</v>

5965
02:48:52.251 --> 02:48:54.190
<v Speaker 13>but I'm sure he's very competent on the ground.</v>

5966
02:48:54.560 --> 02:48:58.820
<v Speaker 13>But Dwayne is more of a specialist in the striking than anything else that he</v>

5967
02:48:58.821 --> 02:48:59.600
<v Speaker 13>does.</v>

5968
02:48:59.600 --> 02:49:03.350
<v Speaker 13>So it only makes sense that you would want to have a guy like Duane where that's</v>

5969
02:49:03.351 --> 02:49:04.400
<v Speaker 13>where his brain works.</v>

5970
02:49:04.401 --> 02:49:07.350
<v Speaker 13>His brain works on these combinations and you'd want to like,</v>

5971
02:49:07.351 --> 02:49:07.830
<v Speaker 13>yeah man,</v>

5972
02:49:07.830 --> 02:49:08.400
<v Speaker 13>do that.</v>

5973
02:49:08.400 --> 02:49:12.840
<v Speaker 13>Like fucking definitely keep doing that cause he's going into these crazy deep</v>

5974
02:49:12.841 --> 02:49:15.690
<v Speaker 13>places with his techniques and his movements and his ideas.</v>

5975
02:49:15.930 --> 02:49:16.530
<v Speaker 13>Dwayne's got,</v>

5976
02:49:16.530 --> 02:49:16.741
<v Speaker 13>he's got,</v>

5977
02:49:16.741 --> 02:49:18.770
<v Speaker 13>he's got all these systems written down like,</v>

5978
02:49:18.980 --> 02:49:20.310
<v Speaker 13>like a lot of his,</v>

5979
02:49:20.370 --> 02:49:21.120
<v Speaker 13>his uh,</v>

5980
02:49:21.120 --> 02:49:23.910
<v Speaker 13>style is documented as opposed to like,</v>

5981
02:49:23.911 --> 02:49:25.470
<v Speaker 13>a lot of people just have it in their head.</v>

5982
02:49:25.740 --> 02:49:25.921
<v Speaker 13>You know,</v>

5983
02:49:25.921 --> 02:49:27.090
<v Speaker 13>they have all their moves and their head,</v>

5984
02:49:27.091 --> 02:49:27.711
<v Speaker 13>they'd have the,</v>

5985
02:49:27.711 --> 02:49:28.544
<v Speaker 13>what they do in their head.</v>

5986
02:49:29.850 --> 02:49:31.710
<v Speaker 13>Ludwig's got all this shit written out.</v>

5987
02:49:32.310 --> 02:49:33.450
<v Speaker 13>He's a freak man.</v>

5988
02:49:33.730 --> 02:49:34.020
<v Speaker 13>Again,</v>

5989
02:49:34.020 --> 02:49:34.561
<v Speaker 13>the best,</v>

5990
02:49:34.561 --> 02:49:36.030
<v Speaker 13>most complimentary way possible.</v>

5991
02:49:36.060 --> 02:49:36.893
<v Speaker 13>But he's a freak.</v>

5992
02:49:37.080 --> 02:49:37.321
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

5993
02:49:37.321 --> 02:49:37.921
<v Speaker 13>Cause see when,</v>

5994
02:49:37.921 --> 02:49:38.161
<v Speaker 13>when,</v>

5995
02:49:38.161 --> 02:49:39.960
<v Speaker 13>when Trump becomes president</v>

5996
02:49:42.890 --> 02:49:45.440
<v Speaker 13>and then society falls and,</v>

5997
02:49:45.450 --> 02:49:47.790
<v Speaker 13>and we get buried under ashes.</v>

5998
02:49:48.590 --> 02:49:50.070
<v Speaker 13>A thousand years from now,</v>

5999
02:49:50.250 --> 02:49:55.250
<v Speaker 13>somebody's going to find that manuscript and recreate the Duane Ludwig neo</v>

6000
02:49:55.471 --> 02:49:58.850
<v Speaker 13>footwear style of striking and they're going to build statues of,</v>

6001
02:50:00.060 --> 02:50:00.301
<v Speaker 13>Dude,</v>

6002
02:50:00.301 --> 02:50:03.440
<v Speaker 13>you make me scared of the election office.</v>

6003
02:50:03.590 --> 02:50:04.450
<v Speaker 13>You're in California.</v>

6004
02:50:04.451 --> 02:50:05.400
<v Speaker 13>You got to register to vote.</v>

6005
02:50:05.401 --> 02:50:06.330
<v Speaker 13>You have two more days.</v>

6006
02:50:06.360 --> 02:50:07.230
<v Speaker 13>I think folks,</v>

6007
02:50:07.530 --> 02:50:09.240
<v Speaker 13>I really think with both those guys,</v>

6008
02:50:09.241 --> 02:50:10.590
<v Speaker 13>you've got to put your wore pants on.</v>

6009
02:50:11.490 --> 02:50:12.420
<v Speaker 13>Both people running.</v>

6010
02:50:12.450 --> 02:50:12.870
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

6011
02:50:12.870 --> 02:50:16.010
<v Speaker 13>Well you could vote for Gary Johnson even though he doesn't know what it,</v>

6012
02:50:16.220 --> 02:50:16.410
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

6013
02:50:16.410 --> 02:50:17.243
<v Speaker 5>is it?</v>

6014
02:50:18.770 --> 02:50:20.030
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know what Aleppo is either.</v>

6015
02:50:20.810 --> 02:50:23.900
<v Speaker 5>Apparently there was a good fight going on here that we completely and totally</v>

6016
02:50:23.901 --> 02:50:24.734
<v Speaker 5>missed.</v>

6017
02:50:24.950 --> 02:50:27.470
<v Speaker 5>That dude looks so much like Chris Kamozi.</v>

6018
02:50:27.471 --> 02:50:27.981
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>

6019
02:50:27.981 --> 02:50:28.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

6020
02:50:28.260 --> 02:50:29.100
<v Speaker 5>it was that Chris Carozzi.</v>

6021
02:50:29.101 --> 02:50:29.990
<v Speaker 5>His brother can't be,</v>

6022
02:50:30.410 --> 02:50:31.243
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

6023
02:50:33.220 --> 02:50:35.750
<v Speaker 5>we're going to say I lost my train of thought.</v>

6024
02:50:38.330 --> 02:50:42.870
<v Speaker 13>You Sea Bell Gar Rui versus Ariel Machado.</v>

6025
02:50:42.900 --> 02:50:43.733
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

6026
02:50:45.150 --> 02:50:45.983
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

6027
02:50:46.350 --> 02:50:48.060
<v Speaker 5>We didn't watch this fight for a second.</v>

6028
02:50:52.500 --> 02:50:55.140
<v Speaker 5>As so often is the fire campaign.</v>

6029
02:50:56.650 --> 02:50:58.620
<v Speaker 5>Middleweight is a middleweight tournament.</v>

6030
02:50:58.621 --> 02:51:00.640
<v Speaker 5>So this is the first round in the middle of a tournament</v>

6031
02:51:02.460 --> 02:51:03.390
<v Speaker 5>tournament for tonight.</v>

6032
02:51:04.620 --> 02:51:06.480
<v Speaker 5>And then the next one is,</v>

6033
02:51:06.540 --> 02:51:07.010
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

6034
02:51:07.010 --> 02:51:07.880
<v Speaker 5>at a senior.</v>

6035
02:51:09.740 --> 02:51:10.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6036
02:51:11.220 --> 02:51:13.450
<v Speaker 5>Style bender stub in there.</v>

6037
02:51:13.860 --> 02:51:14.940
<v Speaker 5>Do you know style bender?</v>

6038
02:51:15.390 --> 02:51:16.223
<v Speaker 5>I know of him.</v>

6039
02:51:16.290 --> 02:51:16.630
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

6040
02:51:16.630 --> 02:51:17.640
<v Speaker 5>I don't know personally.</v>

6041
02:51:17.730 --> 02:51:18.930
<v Speaker 5>Fun Guy to watch fight.</v>

6042
02:51:19.110 --> 02:51:19.680
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

6043
02:51:19.680 --> 02:51:20.310
<v Speaker 5>he's a,</v>

6044
02:51:20.310 --> 02:51:21.550
<v Speaker 5>I'm really interested to see how,</v>

6045
02:51:21.660 --> 02:51:22.470
<v Speaker 5>how this goes.</v>

6046
02:51:22.470 --> 02:51:22.801
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

6047
02:51:22.801 --> 02:51:23.490
<v Speaker 5>me too.</v>

6048
02:51:23.490 --> 02:51:24.660
<v Speaker 5>He's super technical.</v>

6049
02:51:24.661 --> 02:51:29.040
<v Speaker 5>I've seen a bunch of his shit online and he's sort of dabbling in an MMA as</v>

6050
02:51:29.041 --> 02:51:29.371
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>

6051
02:51:29.371 --> 02:51:30.490
<v Speaker 5>He's thinking about fighting him.</v>

6052
02:51:30.980 --> 02:51:33.450
<v Speaker 5>He's working hard and doing anything and gets up,</v>

6053
02:51:35.460 --> 02:51:36.300
<v Speaker 5>but he's just like fighting.</v>

6054
02:51:36.301 --> 02:51:38.490
<v Speaker 5>I'm like the China show so I haven't seen like the,</v>

6055
02:51:40.160 --> 02:51:42.310
<v Speaker 5>like the similar competition or whatnot.</v>

6056
02:51:42.360 --> 02:51:43.790
<v Speaker 5>So I'm interested to see how those go.</v>

6057
02:51:44.850 --> 02:51:48.780
<v Speaker 5>And then Robert Thomas is a got a slower,</v>

6058
02:51:48.940 --> 02:51:49.561
<v Speaker 5>I fought him.</v>

6059
02:51:49.561 --> 02:51:51.270
<v Speaker 5>He was slower but he fucking,</v>

6060
02:51:51.690 --> 02:51:53.190
<v Speaker 5>he's got like a granite chin.</v>

6061
02:51:53.220 --> 02:51:54.390
<v Speaker 5>He's got a cabbage face.</v>

6062
02:51:55.430 --> 02:51:59.040
<v Speaker 5>Like I hit that guy so fucking hard and like he took it.</v>

6063
02:51:59.430 --> 02:52:00.263
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

6064
02:52:01.770 --> 02:52:04.050
<v Speaker 5>I was thinking about the cabinets face.</v>

6065
02:52:04.051 --> 02:52:04.884
<v Speaker 5>That's fine.</v>

6066
02:52:06.520 --> 02:52:07.450
<v Speaker 1>You mean that the most common,</v>

6067
02:52:07.920 --> 02:52:08.770
<v Speaker 1>the nice guys.</v>

6068
02:52:08.771 --> 02:52:09.420
<v Speaker 1>Good guy.</v>

6069
02:52:09.420 --> 02:52:10.141
<v Speaker 1>He's a very,</v>

6070
02:52:10.141 --> 02:52:12.060
<v Speaker 1>he's these very talented Simon and Marcus.</v>

6071
02:52:13.360 --> 02:52:15.040
<v Speaker 1>When you said that guy he's starting to do,</v>

6072
02:52:15.041 --> 02:52:16.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting into some MMA.</v>

6073
02:52:17.320 --> 02:52:19.750
<v Speaker 1>When you look at like kickboxing at this level?</v>

6074
02:52:20.770 --> 02:52:22.420
<v Speaker 1>I think like they should,</v>

6075
02:52:22.810 --> 02:52:27.810
<v Speaker 1>if they want to get an MMA kickboxing and take like a year and really straight</v>

6076
02:52:28.570 --> 02:52:29.880
<v Speaker 1>most of the time wrestle.</v>

6077
02:52:30.050 --> 02:52:30.340
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

6078
02:52:30.340 --> 02:52:30.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6079
02:52:30.740 --> 02:52:31.571
<v Speaker 1>play with the submission.</v>

6080
02:52:31.571 --> 02:52:33.130
<v Speaker 1>Played the submission game and just learn it,</v>

6081
02:52:33.131 --> 02:52:33.970
<v Speaker 1>understand it.</v>

6082
02:52:34.210 --> 02:52:38.650
<v Speaker 1>But learn how to wrestle right first like after their kickboxing.</v>

6083
02:52:38.980 --> 02:52:43.960
<v Speaker 1>Because when you can wrestle and you're comfortable and confident and throwing</v>

6084
02:52:43.961 --> 02:52:44.410
<v Speaker 1>your keys,</v>

6085
02:52:44.410 --> 02:52:46.750
<v Speaker 1>throwing out your real kickboxing skills</v>

6086
02:52:48.250 --> 02:52:50.440
<v Speaker 1>and feel confident that you can defend,</v>

6087
02:52:50.441 --> 02:52:53.070
<v Speaker 1>take downs and if you do get taken down,</v>

6088
02:52:53.090 --> 02:52:55.660
<v Speaker 1>you can get back to your feet then.</v>

6089
02:52:56.140 --> 02:52:57.490
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's what MMA is now.</v>

6090
02:52:57.730 --> 02:52:58.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean the submissions,</v>

6091
02:52:59.140 --> 02:53:00.310
<v Speaker 1>if you get taken down,</v>

6092
02:53:00.311 --> 02:53:01.300
<v Speaker 1>the only time you're,</v>

6093
02:53:01.310 --> 02:53:05.620
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing guys stay on top of the icing and control position is when the</v>

6094
02:53:05.621 --> 02:53:07.090
<v Speaker 1>other guy can't really wrestle.</v>

6095
02:53:07.490 --> 02:53:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

6096
02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:08.831
<v Speaker 1>You know guys,</v>

6097
02:53:08.831 --> 02:53:11.800
<v Speaker 1>you have decent takedown defense when they do get taken out and they work back</v>

6098
02:53:11.801 --> 02:53:12.634
<v Speaker 1>to their feet.</v>

6099
02:53:12.990 --> 02:53:14.530
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're fighting Damien Maia.</v>

6100
02:53:14.830 --> 02:53:15.663
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

6101
02:53:15.700 --> 02:53:18.750
<v Speaker 1>Then you're getting taken down by a ball constructor and know he's,</v>

6102
02:53:18.760 --> 02:53:20.260
<v Speaker 1>he what he did a Rick story.</v>

6103
02:53:20.710 --> 02:53:21.890
<v Speaker 1>I remember watching that going,</v>

6104
02:53:22.090 --> 02:53:23.860
<v Speaker 1>I did not think we were ever going to see that.</v>

6105
02:53:23.980 --> 02:53:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Like stories such a gorilla.</v>

6106
02:53:25.840 --> 02:53:30.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's such a such a physically strong kid that to see Damien get ahold of</v>

6107
02:53:32.141 --> 02:53:34.030
<v Speaker 1>them and just constrict,</v>

6108
02:53:34.690 --> 02:53:35.950
<v Speaker 1>he just constructed them,</v>

6109
02:53:36.160 --> 02:53:37.120
<v Speaker 1>got to his back,</v>

6110
02:53:37.270 --> 02:53:38.290
<v Speaker 1>got ahold of his neck,</v>

6111
02:53:38.291 --> 02:53:38.561
<v Speaker 1>neck,</v>

6112
02:53:38.561 --> 02:53:39.160
<v Speaker 1>cranked him.</v>

6113
02:53:39.160 --> 02:53:39.993
<v Speaker 1>And that was a wrap.</v>

6114
02:53:40.360 --> 02:53:41.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean the way it did it,</v>

6115
02:53:41.501 --> 02:53:42.940
<v Speaker 1>it was a stunning,</v>

6116
02:53:43.330 --> 02:53:45.250
<v Speaker 1>the way he did that Carlos is stunning,</v>

6117
02:53:45.580 --> 02:53:46.413
<v Speaker 1>stunning,</v>

6118
02:53:46.930 --> 02:53:47.440
<v Speaker 1>stunning.</v>

6119
02:53:47.440 --> 02:53:48.130
<v Speaker 1>I didn't expect,</v>

6120
02:53:48.130 --> 02:53:52.330
<v Speaker 1>I expected him to be better than Carlos and the ground by probably by a big</v>

6121
02:53:52.331 --> 02:53:52.930
<v Speaker 1>margin too.</v>

6122
02:53:52.930 --> 02:53:57.490
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't see him just kind of walking there in my eyes.</v>

6123
02:53:57.520 --> 02:54:02.290
<v Speaker 1>It's a testament to the ground game of Roy MacDonald because Rory Mcdonald got</v>

6124
02:54:02.291 --> 02:54:04.590
<v Speaker 1>taken down by Damian in the first round and it,</v>

6125
02:54:04.591 --> 02:54:07.990
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it was Damien on top of him in the mouth and he defended,</v>

6126
02:54:08.260 --> 02:54:08.951
<v Speaker 1>he defended,</v>

6127
02:54:08.951 --> 02:54:12.280
<v Speaker 1>got back to his feet and then beat his ass in the second and the third rounds</v>

6128
02:54:12.550 --> 02:54:13.383
<v Speaker 1>just stand up.</v>

6129
02:54:13.690 --> 02:54:14.523
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6130
02:54:14.680 --> 02:54:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Rory underrated ground game.</v>

6131
02:54:17.620 --> 02:54:21.460
<v Speaker 1>Who did you fight and he fought someone in Metamorris.</v>

6132
02:54:22.890 --> 02:54:23.711
<v Speaker 1>What was it like?</v>

6133
02:54:23.711 --> 02:54:28.711
<v Speaker 1>Jt Torah is like someone who was really good and he got caught in a Kamora and</v>

6134
02:54:28.961 --> 02:54:30.820
<v Speaker 1>he's got his arm all fucked up and he would,</v>

6135
02:54:30.821 --> 02:54:31.654
<v Speaker 1>he didn't tap,</v>

6136
02:54:32.130 --> 02:54:34.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to remember who he fought but he went to,</v>

6137
02:54:34.480 --> 02:54:36.250
<v Speaker 1>you know what they call a draw at those,</v>

6138
02:54:36.251 --> 02:54:38.530
<v Speaker 1>cause they don't really have scores if you don't,</v>

6139
02:54:38.980 --> 02:54:41.200
<v Speaker 1>if you don't submit the guy that goes to a draw.</v>

6140
02:54:41.290 --> 02:54:42.040
<v Speaker 1>Is that who it is?</v>

6141
02:54:42.040 --> 02:54:42.251
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6142
02:54:42.251 --> 02:54:47.251
<v Speaker 1>it's JT Torres and Torres is super high level kid in the grappling scene,</v>

6143
02:54:49.210 --> 02:54:49.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6144
02:54:49.541 --> 02:54:50.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's a,</v>

6145
02:54:50.590 --> 02:54:55.590
<v Speaker 1>he does really well in like high level black belt matches in the grappling.</v>

6146
02:54:56.561 --> 02:54:59.560
<v Speaker 1>So for him to step in like that for Rory to do that,</v>

6147
02:54:59.561 --> 02:55:04.430
<v Speaker 1>while he's a professional MMA fighter and a take on this kid,</v>

6148
02:55:05.300 --> 02:55:06.440
<v Speaker 1>super impressive.</v>

6149
02:55:06.690 --> 02:55:07.610
<v Speaker 1>And he hung in there.</v>

6150
02:55:07.611 --> 02:55:08.121
<v Speaker 1>I mean look at him.</v>

6151
02:55:08.121 --> 02:55:09.530
<v Speaker 1>He's attacking leg locks here.</v>

6152
02:55:10.310 --> 02:55:11.143
<v Speaker 1>They're both</v>

6153
02:55:12.890 --> 02:55:14.270
<v Speaker 1>exchanging heel hooks.</v>

6154
02:55:16.270 --> 02:55:16.611
<v Speaker 1>I hate you.</v>

6155
02:55:16.611 --> 02:55:17.920
<v Speaker 1>I hate looking at heel hooks.</v>

6156
02:55:17.960 --> 02:55:18.321
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

6157
02:55:18.321 --> 02:55:18.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6158
02:55:18.920 --> 02:55:20.710
<v Speaker 1>You're waiting for that to sound like crack,</v>

6159
02:55:20.930 --> 02:55:21.201
<v Speaker 1>crack,</v>

6160
02:55:21.201 --> 02:55:21.591
<v Speaker 1>crack,</v>

6161
02:55:21.591 --> 02:55:22.424
<v Speaker 1>crack.</v>

6162
02:55:22.580 --> 02:55:26.300
<v Speaker 1>I know that he doesn't get finished with this.</v>

6163
02:55:26.301 --> 02:55:26.661
<v Speaker 1>He look,</v>

6164
02:55:26.661 --> 02:55:28.010
<v Speaker 1>I still don't want to look at it and know.</v>

6165
02:55:28.011 --> 02:55:28.550
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6166
02:55:28.550 --> 02:55:30.920
<v Speaker 1>Cause guys get hurt even though they don't get finished.</v>

6167
02:55:30.921 --> 02:55:31.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6168
02:55:31.400 --> 02:55:34.160
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't know that they're hurt and they keep fighting and there's some</v>

6169
02:55:34.161 --> 02:55:37.730
<v Speaker 1>inflammation and later they realize there's a big ass tear and they're MCL or</v>

6170
02:55:37.731 --> 02:55:38.564
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

6171
02:55:38.770 --> 02:55:39.920
<v Speaker 1>That shit happens all the time.</v>

6172
02:55:39.921 --> 02:55:40.701
<v Speaker 1>And then you walk in,</v>

6173
02:55:40.701 --> 02:55:42.980
<v Speaker 1>you feel it when you try to walk up the stairs.</v>

6174
02:55:43.190 --> 02:55:44.570
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever had a knee surgery?</v>

6175
02:55:45.080 --> 02:55:45.411
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

6176
02:55:45.411 --> 02:55:47.380
<v Speaker 1>No knee surgeries as fortunate.</v>

6177
02:55:47.630 --> 02:55:49.670
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible for a kickboxer.</v>

6178
02:55:49.980 --> 02:55:50.960
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

6179
02:55:52.280 --> 02:55:53.113
<v Speaker 1>I've been lucky.</v>

6180
02:55:53.210 --> 02:55:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Damn,</v>

6181
02:55:53.870 --> 02:55:54.380
<v Speaker 1>that's a mate.</v>

6182
02:55:54.380 --> 02:55:56.060
<v Speaker 1>Well you must do it smart.</v>

6183
02:55:56.061 --> 02:55:56.930
<v Speaker 1>Too Smart.</v>

6184
02:55:58.400 --> 02:55:59.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean it Kinda also,</v>

6185
02:55:59.281 --> 02:56:00.410
<v Speaker 1>it seems like my thing going,</v>

6186
02:56:00.430 --> 02:56:05.430
<v Speaker 1>what was my question about a guy like Nigga Madoff who has that insane pedal to</v>

6187
02:56:06.711 --> 02:56:07.820
<v Speaker 1>the metal style,</v>

6188
02:56:08.060 --> 02:56:09.890
<v Speaker 1>whereas you who,</v>

6189
02:56:10.280 --> 02:56:11.930
<v Speaker 1>although you had a very aggressive style,</v>

6190
02:56:11.960 --> 02:56:13.820
<v Speaker 1>it was very well thought out.</v>

6191
02:56:13.940 --> 02:56:14.360
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

6192
02:56:14.360 --> 02:56:14.751
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

6193
02:56:14.751 --> 02:56:16.640
<v Speaker 1>it was very technical and your approach,</v>

6194
02:56:18.260 --> 02:56:20.840
<v Speaker 1>it's not like I'm planning,</v>

6195
02:56:20.841 --> 02:56:22.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't got the ant the idea,</v>

6196
02:56:22.281 --> 02:56:23.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be technical.</v>

6197
02:56:23.570 --> 02:56:24.800
<v Speaker 1>That's just how my brain works,</v>

6198
02:56:24.801 --> 02:56:25.340
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

6199
02:56:25.340 --> 02:56:26.080
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

6200
02:56:26.080 --> 02:56:29.630
<v Speaker 1>Only because I understand that well enough to do it that way.</v>

6201
02:56:29.690 --> 02:56:32.440
<v Speaker 1>And this is not to insinuate the number of office and technical know.</v>

6202
02:56:32.450 --> 02:56:33.600
<v Speaker 1>Obviously he's,</v>

6203
02:56:33.670 --> 02:56:33.890
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

6204
02:56:33.890 --> 02:56:34.940
<v Speaker 1>he's super technical,</v>

6205
02:56:34.941 --> 02:56:36.740
<v Speaker 1>but he's aggressive with that.</v>

6206
02:56:37.990 --> 02:56:38.823
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6207
02:56:39.230 --> 02:56:39.531
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

6208
02:56:39.531 --> 02:56:42.230
<v Speaker 1>he'll just kind of come after you and go while and it turn that,</v>

6209
02:56:42.231 --> 02:56:43.400
<v Speaker 1>turn the heat up all the time.</v>

6210
02:56:43.450 --> 02:56:45.290
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't,</v>

6211
02:56:45.470 --> 02:56:47.630
<v Speaker 1>that guy is angry.</v>

6212
02:56:47.690 --> 02:56:48.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6213
02:56:48.470 --> 02:56:48.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6214
02:56:48.830 --> 02:56:49.810
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way to play it.</v>

6215
02:56:49.811 --> 02:56:49.931
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6216
02:56:49.931 --> 02:56:50.271
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

6217
02:56:50.271 --> 02:56:51.060
<v Speaker 1>you're it,</v>

6218
02:56:51.060 --> 02:56:51.570
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

6219
02:56:51.570 --> 02:56:53.390
<v Speaker 1>you fight calm and collected.</v>

6220
02:56:54.620 --> 02:56:56.240
<v Speaker 1>This dude fights calm and collected.</v>

6221
02:56:56.530 --> 02:56:58.840
<v Speaker 1>I hate to segue like I'm a fucking professional announcer here,</v>

6222
02:56:59.390 --> 02:57:00.890
<v Speaker 1>but a style benders.</v>

6223
02:57:00.891 --> 02:57:01.760
<v Speaker 1>A bad motherfucker.</v>

6224
02:57:01.860 --> 02:57:02.780
<v Speaker 1>He looks real smooth.</v>

6225
02:57:02.840 --> 02:57:05.990
<v Speaker 1>I really enjoy watching him fight and I've been looking forward to this fight in</v>

6226
02:57:05.991 --> 02:57:06.824
<v Speaker 1>particular.</v>

6227
02:57:07.220 --> 02:57:08.053
<v Speaker 1>He's um,</v>

6228
02:57:08.210 --> 02:57:09.110
<v Speaker 1>he's a fun dude.</v>

6229
02:57:09.111 --> 02:57:10.370
<v Speaker 1>He's fun online too.</v>

6230
02:57:10.880 --> 02:57:15.200
<v Speaker 1>He wrote some funny shit about a Brendan shop and a,</v>

6231
02:57:15.230 --> 02:57:18.320
<v Speaker 1>there's two girls were having a pillow fight and Brendan chavs concerned they're</v>

6232
02:57:18.321 --> 02:57:19.370
<v Speaker 1>going to get CTE.</v>

6233
02:57:19.780 --> 02:57:20.101
<v Speaker 1>It was fun.</v>

6234
02:57:20.101 --> 02:57:20.601
<v Speaker 1>He's funny,</v>

6235
02:57:20.601 --> 02:57:20.931
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

6236
02:57:20.931 --> 02:57:21.800
<v Speaker 1>He's a funny dude.</v>

6237
02:57:21.801 --> 02:57:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6238
02:57:22.550 --> 02:57:25.700
<v Speaker 1>I guess like he listens to the fighter and the kid and maybe Brennan shop's been</v>

6239
02:57:25.701 --> 02:57:27.380
<v Speaker 1>talking too much about CTE,</v>

6240
02:57:27.800 --> 02:57:30.300
<v Speaker 1>but he was just being hilarious for Chabad,</v>

6241
02:57:30.320 --> 02:57:32.360
<v Speaker 1>want to help these girls diagnose for CTE.</v>

6242
02:57:35.510 --> 02:57:36.290
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

6243
02:57:36.290 --> 02:57:36.710
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

6244
02:57:36.710 --> 02:57:37.370
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

6245
02:57:37.370 --> 02:57:38.420
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

6246
02:57:38.780 --> 02:57:39.980
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to kickboxing,</v>

6247
02:57:39.981 --> 02:57:41.900
<v Speaker 1>he's the epitome of technique,</v>

6248
02:57:42.350 --> 02:57:42.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6249
02:57:42.711 --> 02:57:43.001
<v Speaker 1>of uh,</v>

02:57:43.001 --> 02:57:43.221
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

6251
02:57:43.221 --> 02:57:43.441
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

6252
02:57:43.441 --> 02:57:44.630
<v Speaker 1>of a technical fighter.</v>

6253
02:57:44.631 --> 02:57:46.280
<v Speaker 1>And he's also super creative.</v>

6254
02:57:46.790 --> 02:57:49.110
<v Speaker 1>I like watching them fight like hell.</v>

6255
02:57:49.220 --> 02:57:49.731
<v Speaker 1>He moved.</v>

6256
02:57:49.731 --> 02:57:50.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6257
02:57:50.060 --> 02:57:51.020
<v Speaker 1>very technical.</v>

6258
02:57:51.380 --> 02:57:56.120
<v Speaker 1>He's very smart the way he fights and he's also extremely capable.</v>

6259
02:57:56.450 --> 02:57:56.631
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6260
02:57:56.631 --> 02:57:56.841
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

6261
02:57:56.841 --> 02:57:58.490
<v Speaker 1>he's got some extreme towns.</v>

6262
02:57:59.410 --> 02:58:02.940
<v Speaker 1>Should be interesting because like you said a Joe,</v>

6263
02:58:02.941 --> 02:58:04.920
<v Speaker 1>he's been fighting in China a lot,</v>

6264
02:58:04.921 --> 02:58:05.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6265
02:58:05.460 --> 02:58:05.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6266
02:58:05.690 --> 02:58:07.380
<v Speaker 1>Law Just Europe over there.</v>

6267
02:58:07.620 --> 02:58:09.420
<v Speaker 1>He gets paid a lot to fight over there I guess.</v>

6268
02:58:09.900 --> 02:58:10.733
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

6269
02:58:10.840 --> 02:58:11.270
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

6270

6271
02:58:13.681 --> 02:58:14.514
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

6272
02:58:14.670 --> 02:58:16.800
<v Speaker 1>I guess this is broadcast everywhere,</v>

6273
02:58:16.801 --> 02:58:17.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6274

6348
03:00:19.420 --> 03:00:20.590
<v Speaker 1>That should be an option.</v>

6349
03:00:20.620 --> 03:00:21.310
<v Speaker 1>Like a,</v>

6369
03:00:53.400 --> 03:00:55.650
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was a bunch of flags.</v>

03:01:04.481 --> 03:01:05.314
<v Speaker 1>Mark kick.</v>

6378
03:01:05.710 --> 03:01:06.670
<v Speaker 1>What do you see in here Joe?</v>

6379
03:01:06.671 --> 03:01:07.504
<v Speaker 1>When you watch them?</v>

6380
03:01:08.520 --> 03:01:09.510
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

6381
03:01:10.380 --> 03:01:11.400
<v Speaker 3>cause you know Thomas,</v>

6382
03:01:11.401 --> 03:01:12.234
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

6383
03:01:12.450 --> 03:01:13.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6384
03:01:13.200 --> 03:01:14.040
<v Speaker 3>you fought him.</v>

6385
03:01:14.370 --> 03:01:14.670
<v Speaker 3>He had a,</v>

6386
03:01:14.670 --> 03:01:15.503
<v Speaker 3>Thomas is a,</v>

6387
03:01:15.540 --> 03:01:17.130
<v Speaker 3>as actually the right now is watching.</v>

6388
03:01:17.160 --> 03:01:20.790
<v Speaker 3>Thomas looks a little different than he's got a little more head movement.</v>

6389
03:01:20.820 --> 03:01:21.090
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

6390
03:01:21.090 --> 03:01:22.800
<v Speaker 3>and he's more of a boxing stance.</v>

6391
03:01:22.940 --> 03:01:23.773
<v Speaker 3>Ooh.</v>

6392
03:01:24.110 --> 03:01:25.200
<v Speaker 3>Thrown decent punches.</v>

6393
03:01:25.350 --> 03:01:26.250
<v Speaker 3>He used to have these,</v>

6394
03:01:26.251 --> 03:01:31.110
<v Speaker 3>like Thomas used to have this overly Thai style and I mean it's like these guys</v>

6395
03:01:31.111 --> 03:01:35.980
<v Speaker 3>that try to fight and try to mimic and copy a traditional Moitai.</v>

6396
03:01:36.390 --> 03:01:36.840
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

6397
03:01:36.840 --> 03:01:37.441
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

6398
03:01:37.441 --> 03:01:39.780
<v Speaker 3>at one it doesn't work when you're that big in my opinion.</v>

6399
03:01:39.840 --> 03:01:42.990
<v Speaker 3>And it in this style of rules is not good.</v>

6400
03:01:43.680 --> 03:01:44.460
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

6401
03:01:44.460 --> 03:01:45.630
<v Speaker 3>Suppose the kickboxing,</v>

6402
03:01:45.840 --> 03:01:47.550
<v Speaker 3>why do you think it doesn't work when you're that big?</v>

6403
03:01:47.580 --> 03:01:50.340
<v Speaker 3>Because a traditional way time,</v>

6404
03:01:50.341 --> 03:01:54.720
<v Speaker 3>when I say that is all about like body cakes and it's like a very upright,</v>

6405
03:01:54.721 --> 03:01:55.560
<v Speaker 3>you stand very,</v>

6406
03:01:55.680 --> 03:01:57.630
<v Speaker 3>very upright and it's a slow pace thing.</v>

6407
03:01:58.380 --> 03:02:01.560
<v Speaker 3>And I think that the guys that are creative that uh,</v>

6408
03:02:02.040 --> 03:02:02.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6409
03:02:02.670 --> 03:02:05.610
<v Speaker 3>makes their punches and the kicks up and we used different movement have more</v>

6410
03:02:05.611 --> 03:02:09.090
<v Speaker 3>like an American kickboxing style or a Dutch kickboxing style,</v>

6411
03:02:09.091 --> 03:02:13.350
<v Speaker 3>a different style than the traditional way ties route I think is more effective</v>

6412
03:02:13.351 --> 03:02:15.570
<v Speaker 3>than the rules are set up for that.</v>

6413
03:02:15.970 --> 03:02:19.450
<v Speaker 1>Well why do you think it's more effective with people that are heavier though?</v>

6414
03:02:20.140 --> 03:02:21.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to slow.</v>

6415
03:02:21.770 --> 03:02:22.603
<v Speaker 1>Slow.</v>

6416
03:02:23.620 --> 03:02:24.071
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

6417
03:02:24.071 --> 03:02:24.520
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

6418
03:02:24.520 --> 03:02:25.610
<v Speaker 1>so like the,</v>

6419
03:02:26.170 --> 03:02:29.590
<v Speaker 1>the guys who are shorter or the smaller guys that was a nice light tech.</v>

6420
03:02:30.010 --> 03:02:31.480
<v Speaker 1>The guys who were smaller,</v>

6421
03:02:31.510 --> 03:02:32.343
<v Speaker 1>like the</v>

6422
03:02:33.820 --> 03:02:35.740
<v Speaker 1>elite guys at the lighter weight classes,</v>

6423
03:02:35.800 --> 03:02:36.370
<v Speaker 1>they could,</v>

6424
03:02:36.370 --> 03:02:39.190
<v Speaker 1>they could move quick enough to pull off that upward stance.</v>

6425
03:02:39.200 --> 03:02:39.590
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

6426
03:02:39.590 --> 03:02:40.020
<v Speaker 3>So the whole,</v>

6427
03:02:40.020 --> 03:02:44.270
<v Speaker 3>like if you think about like Moitai like it was designed as like a martial arts</v>

6428
03:02:44.271 --> 03:02:47.150
<v Speaker 3>for a bunch of people that are 135 pounds.</v>

6429
03:02:47.330 --> 03:02:47.720
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

6430
03:02:47.720 --> 03:02:48.290
<v Speaker 3>Cops,</v>

6431
03:02:48.290 --> 03:02:49.123
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6432
03:02:50.600 --> 03:02:51.433
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

6433
03:02:51.500 --> 03:02:56.240
<v Speaker 3>and the way the rules for traditional Muy Thai does the slow paced five round</v>

6434
03:02:56.241 --> 03:02:56.451
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

6435
03:02:56.451 --> 03:02:57.650
<v Speaker 3>It's like a really slow pace.</v>

6436
03:02:58.160 --> 03:02:59.690
<v Speaker 3>It's all about um,</v>

6437
03:03:01.690 --> 03:03:02.523
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6438
03:03:03.380 --> 03:03:03.780
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6439
03:03:03.780 --> 03:03:04.640
<v Speaker 3>way slower pace.</v>

6440
03:03:04.641 --> 03:03:05.540
<v Speaker 3>It's about gambling.</v>

6441
03:03:05.600 --> 03:03:06.770
<v Speaker 3>It's just really different.</v>

6442
03:03:07.150 --> 03:03:10.430
<v Speaker 3>And we'd go watch it and then they tried to copy it and then they a fight at a</v>

6443
03:03:10.431 --> 03:03:12.260
<v Speaker 3>slow pace going to send you just cracked him.</v>

6444
03:03:13.910 --> 03:03:15.230
<v Speaker 3>Is it about being tougher?</v>

6445
03:03:15.680 --> 03:03:16.940
<v Speaker 3>Like the traditional style?</v>

6446
03:03:16.941 --> 03:03:17.280
<v Speaker 3>Is that,</v>

6447
03:03:17.280 --> 03:03:18.800
<v Speaker 3>does that Kinda what you mean or no,</v>

6448
03:03:18.801 --> 03:03:19.590
<v Speaker 3>not at all.</v>

6449
03:03:19.590 --> 03:03:20.510
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

6450
03:03:21.990 --> 03:03:22.431
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

6451
03:03:22.431 --> 03:03:22.811
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

6452
03:03:22.811 --> 03:03:24.410
<v Speaker 3>Like it seems like I,</v>

6453
03:03:24.411 --> 03:03:25.244
<v Speaker 3>when I think about it,</v>

6454
03:03:25.250 --> 03:03:26.330
<v Speaker 3>traditional Thai style,</v>

6455
03:03:26.331 --> 03:03:31.331
<v Speaker 3>it's Kinda screaming up and throwing straight straight shots and trying to land</v>

6456
03:03:32.271 --> 03:03:33.410
<v Speaker 3>that hard kick to the body.</v>

6457
03:03:33.440 --> 03:03:35.120
<v Speaker 3>Robert Thomas looks way different.</v>

6458
03:03:37.070 --> 03:03:38.090
<v Speaker 3>What looks different about him?</v>

6459
03:03:38.091 --> 03:03:38.470
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

6460
03:03:38.470 --> 03:03:39.470
<v Speaker 3>wait a lot more.</v>

6461
03:03:39.471 --> 03:03:40.550
<v Speaker 3>Turned into his stance.</v>

6462
03:03:40.551 --> 03:03:43.180
<v Speaker 3>He's got way more of a boxing stance as opposed to having like where he had</v>

6463
03:03:43.190 --> 03:03:43.611
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

6464
03:03:43.611 --> 03:03:44.570
<v Speaker 3>He was really squared up.</v>

6465
03:03:45.100 --> 03:03:45.290
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

6466
03:03:45.290 --> 03:03:46.510
<v Speaker 3>he's sitting down in his punch.</v>

6467
03:03:46.530 --> 03:03:47.241
<v Speaker 3>He's sitting down.</v>

6468
03:03:47.241 --> 03:03:49.460
<v Speaker 3>Where so you see a lot of improvement?</v>

6469
03:03:49.461 --> 03:03:50.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6470
03:03:50.180 --> 03:03:50.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

6471
03:03:50.660 --> 03:03:50.901
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

6472
03:03:50.901 --> 03:03:53.260
<v Speaker 3>for my liking and then uh,</v>

6473
03:03:53.560 --> 03:03:55.130
<v Speaker 3>he's being a lot more aggressive with his hands.</v>

6474
03:03:55.940 --> 03:03:58.100
<v Speaker 3>So it really good glory.</v>

6475
03:03:58.101 --> 03:03:58.940
<v Speaker 3>37,</v>

6476
03:03:59.000 --> 03:03:59.781
<v Speaker 3>Los Angeles,</v>

6477
03:03:59.781 --> 03:04:00.890
<v Speaker 3>January 20th.</v>

6478
03:04:02.940 --> 03:04:03.560
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

6479
03:04:03.560 --> 03:04:06.020
<v Speaker 3>you said lion fight is on fight pass.</v>

6480
03:04:06.050 --> 03:04:07.070
<v Speaker 3>Is it on fight pass?</v>

6481
03:04:07.460 --> 03:04:07.851
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

6482
03:04:07.851 --> 03:04:09.990
<v Speaker 3>I think I heard a couple of really?</v>

6483
03:04:10.690 --> 03:04:11.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6484
03:04:11.090 --> 03:04:12.560
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know lion fight was on it too.</v>

6485
03:04:12.561 --> 03:04:13.394
<v Speaker 3>I thought they were,</v>

6486
03:04:14.660 --> 03:04:15.261
<v Speaker 3>I could be wrong,</v>

6487
03:04:15.261 --> 03:04:16.094
<v Speaker 3>but I'm pretty,</v>

6488
03:04:16.130 --> 03:04:16.963
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I am.</v>

6489
03:04:19.010 --> 03:04:19.780
<v Speaker 3>What's so funny,</v>

6490
03:04:19.780 --> 03:04:20.830
<v Speaker 3>I was just as like,</v>

6491
03:04:21.240 --> 03:04:22.940
<v Speaker 3>if Abella Toy fipass</v>

6492
03:04:25.410 --> 03:04:26.243
<v Speaker 3>poor bell.</v>

6493
03:04:26.910 --> 03:04:28.460
<v Speaker 3>How do you guys see this fight somewhere?</v>

6494
03:04:29.180 --> 03:04:29.530
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

6495
03:04:29.530 --> 03:04:31.620
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting Thomas.</v>

6496
03:04:31.890 --> 03:04:32.340
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

6497
03:04:32.340 --> 03:04:33.240
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

6498
03:04:33.450 --> 03:04:34.560
<v Speaker 1>he's definitely,</v>

6499
03:04:34.561 --> 03:04:35.850
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me he looks like</v>

6500
03:04:35.990 --> 03:04:37.870
<v Speaker 3>a better fighter than he was when he fought you.</v>

6501
03:04:37.910 --> 03:04:40.550
<v Speaker 3>Thomas used to not like use his hands like aggressively.</v>

6502
03:04:40.580 --> 03:04:41.420
<v Speaker 3>So I didn't think he did.</v>

6503
03:04:41.540 --> 03:04:44.590
<v Speaker 3>And I told him after the vice work on his boxing line,</v>

6504
03:04:44.810 --> 03:04:48.860
<v Speaker 3>but he used to be all about like this step up me and this body kick and I</v>

6505
03:04:48.861 --> 03:04:50.210
<v Speaker 3>haven't seen him try to do that at all.</v>

6506
03:04:50.211 --> 03:04:51.290
<v Speaker 3>And He's thinking much,</v>

6507
03:04:51.291 --> 03:04:53.450
<v Speaker 3>sit sitting down a lot better and it stands.</v>

6508
03:04:54.350 --> 03:04:55.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he's winning on points or not,</v>

6509
03:04:55.661 --> 03:04:56.494
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

6510
03:04:57.430 --> 03:04:58.263
<v Speaker 3>hey Janice,</v>

6511

6514
03:05:02.031 --> 03:05:02.864
<v Speaker 3>I said</v>

6515
03:05:04.040 --> 03:05:05.120
<v Speaker 3>the shorts are dope though.</v>

6516
03:05:05.340 --> 03:05:06.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6518
03:05:08.281 --> 03:05:11.150

<v Speaker 3>Well I think you know Robert Thomas looks good here.</v>

6520
03:05:14.530 --> 03:05:15.363

<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

6526
03:05:22.560 --> 03:05:23.400
<v Speaker 3>the solar plex.</v>

6527
03:05:23.401 --> 03:05:24.150
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

6528
03:05:24.150 --> 03:05:24.990
<v Speaker 3>It might be it.</v>

6529
03:05:24.991 --> 03:05:25.261
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6530
03:05:25.261 --> 03:05:26.094
<v Speaker 3>that was a bad one.</v>

6531
03:05:28.120 --> 03:05:28.471
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

6532
03:05:28.471 --> 03:05:30.320
<v Speaker 1>He got back up at nine Taylor.</v>

6533
03:05:30.330 --> 03:05:31.081
<v Speaker 1>That was a tough one.</v>

6534
03:05:31.081 --> 03:05:32.100
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

6535
03:05:33.950 --> 03:05:34.411
<v Speaker 1>This claim.</v>

6536
03:05:34.411 --> 03:05:35.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't cause I'm like,</v>

6537
03:05:35.180 --> 03:05:37.220
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like trying to fight on ballot though.</v>

6538
03:05:37.500 --> 03:05:39.960
<v Speaker 1>So no fight bath of gobble everything.</v>

6539
03:05:39.961 --> 03:05:40.531
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

6540
03:05:40.531 --> 03:05:40.771
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6541
03:05:40.771 --> 03:05:42.360
<v Speaker 1>It's cool to put everything in one spot.</v>

6542
03:05:43.670 --> 03:05:44.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like Netflix.</v>

6543
03:05:44.790 --> 03:05:47.190
<v Speaker 1>I personally route for Bella tour.</v>

6544
03:05:48.030 --> 03:05:48.863
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

6545
03:05:48.960 --> 03:05:52.530
<v Speaker 1>I think it's good for everybody to have more events.</v>

6546
03:05:52.740 --> 03:05:53.910
<v Speaker 1>I think it's good for the sport.</v>

6547
03:05:53.970 --> 03:05:55.170
<v Speaker 1>It elevates a sport.</v>

6548
03:05:55.620 --> 03:05:56.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's bad for the UFC.</v>

6549
03:05:56.851 --> 03:05:58.200
<v Speaker 1>I think the UFC is giant.</v>

6550
03:05:58.620 --> 03:05:59.670
<v Speaker 1>It's only going to get bigger.</v>

6551
03:05:59.880 --> 03:06:01.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's bad that Bella toward does good.</v>

6552
03:06:02.490 --> 03:06:04.170
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's great the way there,</v>

6553
03:06:04.230 --> 03:06:07.710
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing now where they're taking fighters who you know did well in</v>

6554
03:06:07.711 --> 03:06:10.920
<v Speaker 1>the UFC and maybe it didn't work out for them or maybe they decided to try to</v>

6555
03:06:10.921 --> 03:06:12.930
<v Speaker 1>chest her options like Rory Macdonald,</v>

6556
03:06:13.260 --> 03:06:14.310
<v Speaker 1>Phil Davis,</v>

6557
03:06:14.510 --> 03:06:15.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6558
03:06:15.090 --> 03:06:16.650
<v Speaker 1>they're developing a real roster.</v>

6559
03:06:16.710 --> 03:06:17.543
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6560
03:06:17.880 --> 03:06:19.350
<v Speaker 1>And Lori's Worldclass,</v>

6561
03:06:19.380 --> 03:06:21.930
<v Speaker 1>he's a worldclass welterweight in anybody's book.</v>

6562
03:06:21.960 --> 03:06:25.440
<v Speaker 1>What happens because of that is because now you bring these guys with that UFC</v>

6563
03:06:25.441 --> 03:06:26.910
<v Speaker 1>level experience cause it's all,</v>

6564
03:06:26.911 --> 03:06:27.061
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

6565
03:06:27.061 --> 03:06:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Some of those bell told guys can walk right into the UFC and do well Michael</v>

6566
03:06:31.710 --> 03:06:31.830
<v Speaker 1>Chandler.</v>

6567
03:06:31.830 --> 03:06:32.041
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6568
03:06:32.041 --> 03:06:32.874
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

6569
03:06:32.960 --> 03:06:34.410
<v Speaker 1>But not all of them.</v>

6570
03:06:34.650 --> 03:06:34.890
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6571
03:06:34.890 --> 03:06:38.250
<v Speaker 1>But when you bring that UFC level experience back to the Bella cage,</v>

6572
03:06:38.520 --> 03:06:39.870
<v Speaker 1>then that rate,</v>

6573
03:06:39.871 --> 03:06:42.330
<v Speaker 1>that's the same thing that I've seen before about that void.</v>

6574
03:06:43.400 --> 03:06:46.080
<v Speaker 1>There's a point now these guys can raise their level.</v>

6575
03:06:46.081 --> 03:06:48.180
<v Speaker 1>Some the guys that aren't there,</v>

6576
03:06:48.210 --> 03:06:50.100
<v Speaker 1>but they're in that environment.</v>

6577
03:06:50.490 --> 03:06:51.323
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6578
03:06:51.480 --> 03:06:52.350
<v Speaker 1>You would know this.</v>

6579
03:06:52.351 --> 03:06:53.460
<v Speaker 1>You're in the loop.</v>

6580
03:06:53.610 --> 03:06:58.280
<v Speaker 1>What happened with Ben Ascaris [inaudible] why did he not go back to bell tour?</v>

6581
03:06:58.300 --> 03:06:59.280
<v Speaker 1>He was the champion.</v>

6582
03:06:59.510 --> 03:07:04.510
<v Speaker 1>Like that's so rare that a champion leaves with the belt and winds up going and</v>

6583
03:07:05.491 --> 03:07:06.540
<v Speaker 1>fighting somewhere else.</v>

6584
03:07:06.630 --> 03:07:06.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6585
03:07:06.990 --> 03:07:08.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember at all.</v>

6586
03:07:08.550 --> 03:07:10.080
<v Speaker 1>I know I asked them about,</v>

6587
03:07:10.110 --> 03:07:11.430
<v Speaker 1>oh how convenient.</v>

6588
03:07:14.190 --> 03:07:15.023
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6589
03:07:16.800 --> 03:07:17.970
<v Speaker 1>I vaguely remember,</v>

6590
03:07:18.060 --> 03:07:22.140
<v Speaker 1>he's the one guy that troubles me the most out of all the people that are not</v>

6591
03:07:22.141 --> 03:07:23.610
<v Speaker 1>competing right now in the UFC.</v>

6592
03:07:23.940 --> 03:07:26.550
<v Speaker 1>He's the one guy that troubles me the most because,</v>

6593
03:07:26.551 --> 03:07:27.384
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6594
03:07:27.780 --> 03:07:30.090
<v Speaker 1>I would want to see what he can do.</v>

6595
03:07:30.450 --> 03:07:31.470
<v Speaker 1>I want to see what he can do.</v>

6596
03:07:31.770 --> 03:07:32.160
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

6597
03:07:32.160 --> 03:07:32.431
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6598
03:07:32.431 --> 03:07:35.940
<v Speaker 1>people say that his style is boring or that they don't like it cause he just</v>

6599
03:07:35.941 --> 03:07:39.510
<v Speaker 1>gets on top of guys and becomes a blanket and punched him in the face.</v>

6600
03:07:39.690 --> 03:07:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Mike.</v>

6601
03:07:39.930 --> 03:07:40.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6602
03:07:40.291 --> 03:07:42.150
<v Speaker 1>but he can do that.</v>

6603
03:07:42.480 --> 03:07:42.631
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

6604
03:07:42.631 --> 03:07:46.110
<v Speaker 1>don't you think it's imperative that we show what can be done?</v>

6605
03:07:46.140 --> 03:07:47.940
<v Speaker 1>Like can he do that to Damien Maia?</v>

6606
03:07:47.970 --> 03:07:49.560
<v Speaker 1>I want to know who we can do it too.</v>

6607
03:07:49.860 --> 03:07:50.880
<v Speaker 1>I want to know who we could do it too.</v>

6608
03:07:50.881 --> 03:07:51.720
<v Speaker 1>And there's only one way.</v>

6609
03:07:51.721 --> 03:07:52.140
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

6610
03:07:52.140 --> 03:07:53.520
<v Speaker 1>he's done it to a lot of people.</v>

6611
03:07:53.520 --> 03:07:54.780
<v Speaker 1>Look what he did to Korskoff.</v>

6612
03:07:54.990 --> 03:07:55.301
<v Speaker 1>You know how,</v>

6643
03:08:30.781 --> 03:08:32.400
<v Speaker 1>Make it a fucking scrap look.</v>

6644
03:08:32.550 --> 03:08:35.490
<v Speaker 1>One of his toughest fights in Belterra was Jay Heran.</v>

6645
03:08:35.520 --> 03:08:35.850
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

6646
03:08:35.850 --> 03:08:36.683
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6647
03:08:36.860 --> 03:08:37.693
<v Speaker 1>Jason Wrestle.</v>

6648
03:08:38.040 --> 03:08:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6649
03:08:38.580 --> 03:08:39.413
<v Speaker 1>Jake and Russell.</v>

6650
03:08:39.980 --> 03:08:40.460
<v Speaker 1>Jay's,</v>

6651
03:08:40.460 --> 03:08:41.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6652
03:08:41.130 --> 03:08:45.990
<v Speaker 1>he's a very good MMA fighter and he can wrestle and so that he was better in the</v>

6653
03:08:45.991 --> 03:08:47.310
<v Speaker 1>striking then.</v>

6654
03:08:48.450 --> 03:08:49.800
<v Speaker 1>Then aspirin was at the time.</v>

6655
03:08:49.801 --> 03:08:50.634
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6656
03:08:50.970 --> 03:08:51.691
<v Speaker 1>But asking to strike,</v>

6657
03:08:51.691 --> 03:08:52.560
<v Speaker 1>he's not that bad either.</v>

6658
03:08:52.561 --> 03:08:54.210
<v Speaker 1>He knows how the fuck get away from Shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

6660
03:08:54.720 --> 03:08:55.920
<v Speaker 1>And when he gets a hold of guys,</v>

6661
03:08:55.921 --> 03:08:58.440
<v Speaker 1>he takes him down these ways that just not expecting,</v>

6666
03:09:03.600 --> 03:09:04.920

6667
03:09:04.950 --> 03:09:05.940
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want to see.</v>

6668

6672
03:09:10.441 --> 03:09:11.580
<v Speaker 1>Can you get past those kicks?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like what's going gonna?</v>

6674
03:09:12.570 --> 03:09:13.710
<v Speaker 1>What's going to happen there?</v>

6675
03:09:14.460 --> 03:09:15.293
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>

6676
03:09:15.540 --> 03:09:19.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's not a whole lot of guys that are specialists in and that's</v>

6677
03:09:19.770 --> 03:09:22.440
<v Speaker 1>much of a pure sense as he is.</v>

6678
03:09:22.770 --> 03:09:27.770
<v Speaker 1>He's a wrestling specialist and he's a real world class wrestler and anytime</v>

6679
03:09:29.521 --> 03:09:31.050
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy like that out there for me,</v>

6680
03:09:31.051 --> 03:09:32.280
<v Speaker 1>it's just like shit.</v>

6681
03:09:33.090 --> 03:09:33.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6682
03:09:33.301 --> 03:09:38.130
<v Speaker 1>Especially when when they come in with a different style of that specialty,</v>

6683
03:09:39.300 --> 03:09:41.300
<v Speaker 1>like askern style isn't the same.</v>

6684
03:09:41.340 --> 03:09:42.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6685
03:09:42.070 --> 03:09:44.430
<v Speaker 1>no magna Madoff is a specialist as a wrestler,</v>

6686
03:09:44.460 --> 03:09:46.350
<v Speaker 1>but [inaudible] style is different.</v>

6687
03:09:46.410 --> 03:09:47.100
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

6688
03:09:47.100 --> 03:09:49.080
<v Speaker 1>African style is just bizarre.</v>

6689
03:09:49.710 --> 03:09:51.970
<v Speaker 1>It just holds onto guys and weird way.</v>

6690
03:09:52.390 --> 03:09:53.223
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

6691
03:09:53.690 --> 03:09:56.830
<v Speaker 1>And he just seems so much stronger than he looks.</v>

6692
03:09:57.250 --> 03:09:58.480
<v Speaker 1>He's very interesting man.</v>

6693
03:09:58.600 --> 03:09:59.433
<v Speaker 1>But just,</v>

6694
03:09:59.500 --> 03:10:02.560
<v Speaker 1>I hate to bring that up again,</v>

6695
03:10:02.561 --> 03:10:07.210
<v Speaker 1>but the only reason why I do is because I am a fan of the sport.</v>

6696
03:10:07.750 --> 03:10:11.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of the sport and I don't think the sport is the most exciting</v>

6697
03:10:11.561 --> 03:10:12.280
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

6698
03:10:12.280 --> 03:10:14.980
<v Speaker 1>I think the sport is the sport.</v>

6699
03:10:15.430 --> 03:10:19.640
<v Speaker 1>If there's something that's not as exciting but is more effective,</v>

6700
03:10:19.660 --> 03:10:23.890
<v Speaker 1>that's still a part of the sport and you can't ignore that something just cause</v>

6701
03:10:23.891 --> 03:10:28.660
<v Speaker 1>it's convenient for your vision of what makes a sport dynamic and exciting</v>

6702
03:10:28.840 --> 03:10:32.440
<v Speaker 1>because then stopped the sport anymore because then it's the sport plus</v>

6703
03:10:32.441 --> 03:10:33.130
<v Speaker 1>entertainment.</v>

6704
03:10:33.130 --> 03:10:34.420
<v Speaker 1>But this guy's going to stink it up.</v>

6705
03:10:34.540 --> 03:10:37.570
<v Speaker 1>We're going to keep them on the outside and he might not,</v>

6706
03:10:37.571 --> 03:10:40.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean it might be Jay hair on squared.</v>

6707
03:10:40.660 --> 03:10:44.560
<v Speaker 1>You get him in with or with someone like a wonderful boy or Tyron Woodley or</v>

6708
03:10:44.561 --> 03:10:45.730
<v Speaker 1>someone along those lines,</v>

6709
03:10:45.731 --> 03:10:45.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6710
03:10:45.971 --> 03:10:46.570
<v Speaker 1>entire name.</v>

6711
03:10:46.570 --> 03:10:47.410
<v Speaker 1>They know each other.</v>

6712
03:10:47.560 --> 03:10:48.311
<v Speaker 1>Go right there.</v>

6713
03:10:48.311 --> 03:10:48.980
<v Speaker 1>Their teammates,</v>

6714
03:10:48.980 --> 03:10:49.570
<v Speaker 1>they fight.</v>

6715
03:10:49.570 --> 03:10:50.050
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6716
03:10:50.050 --> 03:10:50.510
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

6717
03:10:50.510 --> 03:10:51.160
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't.</v>

6718
03:10:51.160 --> 03:10:52.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they would fight.</v>

6719
03:10:52.600 --> 03:10:54.310
<v Speaker 1>I doubt they would fight even for the belt.</v>

6720
03:10:54.790 --> 03:10:55.623
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

6721
03:10:56.260 --> 03:10:59.620
<v Speaker 1>Well that would be an interesting fight if they weren't that good friends</v>

6722
03:10:59.680 --> 03:11:02.470
<v Speaker 1>stylistically because Tyron is a really good wrestler too and that,</v>

6723
03:11:02.560 --> 03:11:03.910
<v Speaker 1>but they know power.</v>

6724
03:11:03.940 --> 03:11:04.930
<v Speaker 1>He know each other to.</v>

6725
03:11:04.931 --> 03:11:06.310
<v Speaker 1>I think I honestly,</v>

6726
03:11:06.311 --> 03:11:07.121
<v Speaker 1>in an MMA fight,</v>

6727
03:11:07.121 --> 03:11:11.380
<v Speaker 1>I think it's bad for Ben simply because they know each other so well and Tyron</v>

6728
03:11:11.381 --> 03:11:13.550
<v Speaker 1>is more explosive with the striking.</v>

6729
03:11:13.810 --> 03:11:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

6730
03:11:14.290 --> 03:11:14.830
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

6731
03:11:14.830 --> 03:11:15.370
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

6732
03:11:15.370 --> 03:11:16.280
<v Speaker 1>oh ow.</v>

6733
03:11:16.700 --> 03:11:18.310
<v Speaker 1>I say that style bender.</v>

6734
03:11:18.430 --> 03:11:19.270
<v Speaker 1>It's no joke</v>

6735
03:11:22.720 --> 03:11:23.560
<v Speaker 1>standing up</v>

6736
03:11:25.360 --> 03:11:26.650
<v Speaker 1>just 15 seconds ago.</v>

6737
03:11:26.651 --> 03:11:28.680
<v Speaker 1>He's going to survive is caught.</v>

6738
03:11:28.710 --> 03:11:29.543
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

6739
03:11:34.450 --> 03:11:35.150
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

6740
03:11:35.150 --> 03:11:35.600
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

6741
03:11:35.600 --> 03:11:37.100
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful combination there.</v>

6742
03:11:37.130 --> 03:11:38.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh right hand.</v>

6743
03:11:38.520 --> 03:11:39.330
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

6744
03:11:39.330 --> 03:11:40.163
<v Speaker 1>Ooh</v>

6745
03:11:44.090 --> 03:11:44.330
<v Speaker 1>short.</v>

6746
03:11:44.330 --> 03:11:46.100
<v Speaker 1>It's a dope as fuck they are.</v>

6747
03:11:47.180 --> 03:11:48.860
<v Speaker 1>It's a fun guy to watch man.</v>

6748
03:11:48.861 --> 03:11:49.694
<v Speaker 1>It good fight.</v>

6749
03:11:50.590 --> 03:11:51.423
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

6750
03:11:51.750 --> 03:11:53.010
<v Speaker 1>Robert Thomas look a lot better though.</v>

6751
03:11:53.660 --> 03:11:54.493
<v Speaker 6>Good.</v>

6752
03:11:58.300 --> 03:12:00.640
<v Speaker 1>So that was a round one of the tournament for him.</v>

6753
03:12:00.641 --> 03:12:00.881
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6754
03:12:00.881 --> 03:12:04.780
<v Speaker 1>So he might have to say if he wins this then he fights in the next year.</v>

6755
03:12:04.800 --> 03:12:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Who won?</v>

6756
03:12:05.350 --> 03:12:06.280
<v Speaker 1>Who were paying attention?</v>

6757
03:12:06.281 --> 03:12:07.930
<v Speaker 1>We weren't paying attention to at all.</v>

6758
03:12:08.410 --> 03:12:09.430
<v Speaker 1>Not even a little.</v>

6759
03:12:11.700 --> 03:12:12.290
<v Speaker 1>Jamie Solomon.</v>

6760
03:12:12.290 --> 03:12:13.123
<v Speaker 1>Paul,</v>

6761
03:12:15.190 --> 03:12:19.120
<v Speaker 1>this is another fight that I'm really interested in or style matchup I'm really</v>

6762
03:12:19.121 --> 03:12:24.121
<v Speaker 1>interested in is that explosive speed of tiring versus that slow methodical</v>

6763
03:12:24.191 --> 03:12:25.510
<v Speaker 1>style of Maya too.</v>

6764
03:12:25.511 --> 03:12:26.410
<v Speaker 1>That's another one.</v>

6765
03:12:26.411 --> 03:12:26.870
<v Speaker 1>Like kitten.</v>

6766
03:12:26.870 --> 03:12:28.420
<v Speaker 1>Can he take tire it down?</v>

6767
03:12:28.720 --> 03:12:29.300
<v Speaker 1>That's in here.</v>

6768
03:12:29.300 --> 03:12:33.310
<v Speaker 1>Get to Chiron and you're going to have to go through hell to get to them because</v>

6769
03:12:33.760 --> 03:12:35.290
<v Speaker 1>there's no question in the world,</v>

6770
03:12:35.470 --> 03:12:38.590
<v Speaker 1>there's no question in my mind at least the Tyron moves far faster,</v>

6771
03:12:38.800 --> 03:12:39.041
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6772
03:12:39.041 --> 03:12:41.650
<v Speaker 1>So he's a very difficult to get ahold of grappler,</v>

6773
03:12:41.750 --> 03:12:42.190
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

6774
03:12:42.190 --> 03:12:42.820
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

6775
03:12:42.820 --> 03:12:43.120
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6776
03:12:43.120 --> 03:12:43.930
<v Speaker 1>Very good wrestling.</v>

6777
03:12:43.930 --> 03:12:47.320
<v Speaker 1>And then he moves far faster and he's got thunderous power.</v>

6778
03:12:47.590 --> 03:12:49.510
<v Speaker 1>So mine is going to have to take chances.</v>

6779
03:12:49.750 --> 03:12:50.980
<v Speaker 1>So in taking those chances,</v>

6780
03:12:51.050 --> 03:12:51.831
<v Speaker 1>close that distance,</v>

6781
03:12:51.831 --> 03:12:52.300
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

6782
03:12:52.300 --> 03:12:53.720
<v Speaker 13>he's not kicking specialist either,</v>

6783
03:12:53.721 --> 03:12:57.260
<v Speaker 13>so he's going to be taking those chances with his hands and you're just going to</v>

6784
03:12:57.261 --> 03:12:58.940
<v Speaker 13>run into these potential counters,</v>

6785
03:12:58.941 --> 03:13:00.350
<v Speaker 13>especially in the first round for,</v>

6786
03:13:00.351 --> 03:13:01.184
<v Speaker 13>for anybody.</v>

6787
03:13:01.430 --> 03:13:05.990
<v Speaker 13>Tyron is the scariest and the first round because he just has so much speed and</v>

6788
03:13:05.991 --> 03:13:07.790
<v Speaker 13>explosion and I think it takes,</v>

6789
03:13:07.791 --> 03:13:10.090
<v Speaker 13>guys were surprised they day to my surprise.</v>

6790
03:13:10.100 --> 03:13:14.870
<v Speaker 13>And it probably takes them at least around or about around to adjust to that</v>

6791
03:13:14.871 --> 03:13:15.560
<v Speaker 13>speed.</v>

6792
03:13:15.560 --> 03:13:16.700
<v Speaker 13>At the very least,</v>

6793
03:13:17.030 --> 03:13:19.010
<v Speaker 13>there's been some knock outs like the Josh,</v>

6794
03:13:19.050 --> 03:13:19.883
<v Speaker 13>Tom,</v>

6795
03:13:21.020 --> 03:13:22.270
<v Speaker 13>Josh Koscheck knockout.</v>

6796
03:13:22.280 --> 03:13:22.791
<v Speaker 13>Remember that one?</v>

6797
03:13:22.791 --> 03:13:23.150
<v Speaker 13>Yup.</v>

6798
03:13:23.150 --> 03:13:24.110
<v Speaker 13>Oh my goodness.</v>

6799
03:13:25.100 --> 03:13:26.090
<v Speaker 13>Oh my goodness.</v>

6800
03:13:27.230 --> 03:13:28.063
<v Speaker 13>Just,</v>

6801
03:13:28.100 --> 03:13:31.190
<v Speaker 13>just a fucking bomb over the top.</v>

6802
03:13:32.390 --> 03:13:33.160
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

6803
03:13:33.160 --> 03:13:33.561
<v Speaker 13>The way,</v>

6804
03:13:33.561 --> 03:13:34.394
<v Speaker 13>the way he was.</v>

6805
03:13:34.850 --> 03:13:38.600
<v Speaker 13>I can picture it in my head and the way he's standing up over him in that,</v>

6806
03:13:38.601 --> 03:13:42.050
<v Speaker 13>in that it's kind of scary.</v>

6807
03:13:42.400 --> 03:13:44.300
<v Speaker 13>It looks scary when you see,</v>

6808
03:13:44.301 --> 03:13:44.930
<v Speaker 13>cause they're both,</v>

6809
03:13:44.930 --> 03:13:47.210
<v Speaker 13>it looks like two superhero has just gotten into a fight.</v>

6810
03:13:47.530 --> 03:13:48.363
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

6811
03:13:50.300 --> 03:13:51.860

03:14:55.160 --> 03:14:56.600
<v Speaker 13>He's really good.</v>

6857
03:14:57.380 --> 03:14:58.213

6860
03:15:02.301 --> 03:15:06.200
<v Speaker 13>about specialists or people that just have that higher level.</v>

6861
03:15:06.830 --> 03:15:09.440
<v Speaker 13>Well that's one of the things that always intrigued me about aspirin.</v>

6862
03:15:09.910 --> 03:15:11.360
<v Speaker 13>I said Pedis would say like,</v>

6863
03:15:11.390 --> 03:15:12.410
<v Speaker 13>I couldn't fight that dude.</v>

6864
03:15:12.740 --> 03:15:13.340
<v Speaker 13>That dude,</v>

6865
03:15:13.340 --> 03:15:14.450
<v Speaker 13>he just holds me down.</v>

6866
03:15:14.480 --> 03:15:15.760
<v Speaker 13>Do whatever the fuck he wants to me.</v>

6867
03:15:17.320 --> 03:15:19.680
<v Speaker 13>I want to see the Ma.</v>

6868
03:15:21.290 --> 03:15:25.160
<v Speaker 13>I want to say Ben used to like,</v>

6869
03:15:25.161 --> 03:15:25.611
<v Speaker 13>he,</v>

6870
03:15:25.611 --> 03:15:29.390
<v Speaker 13>I met him when I first met Tyra and I went up to Missouri to train and um,</v>

6871
03:15:30.520 --> 03:15:31.110
<v Speaker 13>we were retiring,</v>

6872
03:15:31.110 --> 03:15:34.460
<v Speaker 13>took me some time to some tournament and Ben was,</v>

6873
03:15:34.670 --> 03:15:36.680
<v Speaker 13>he was just going out and pin and dude,</v>

6874
03:15:36.740 --> 03:15:37.041
<v Speaker 13>I mean,</v>

6875
03:15:37.041 --> 03:15:41.960
<v Speaker 13>he's pinning like college level wrestlers in the first period.</v>

6876
03:15:41.961 --> 03:15:42.890
<v Speaker 13>Sometimes like,</v>

6877
03:15:42.891 --> 03:15:43.724
<v Speaker 13>quickly,</v>

6878
03:15:43.820 --> 03:15:44.210
<v Speaker 13>um,</v>

6879
03:15:44.210 --> 03:15:47.640
<v Speaker 13>Dean Dean says to me the first time he met Ben or they'll order,</v>

6880
03:15:47.641 --> 03:15:49.040
<v Speaker 13>the first time he worked out with Ben,</v>

6881
03:15:49.470 --> 03:15:50.010
<v Speaker 13>he's like,</v>

6882
03:15:50.010 --> 03:15:50.311
<v Speaker 11>Ben,</v>

6883
03:15:50.311 --> 03:15:51.190
<v Speaker 11>just asking him goes,</v>

6884
03:15:51.840 --> 03:15:53.160
<v Speaker 11>do you know what a sprawl is?</v>

6885
03:15:53.620 --> 03:15:54.030
<v Speaker 11>Like,</v>

6886
03:15:54.030 --> 03:15:54.751
<v Speaker 11>like he just,</v>

6887
03:15:54.751 --> 03:15:57.390
<v Speaker 11>he couldn't do anything about what Ben was doing to him.</v>

6888
03:15:57.540 --> 03:15:58.770
<v Speaker 11>So he didn't know.</v>

6889
03:15:58.800 --> 03:16:01.020
<v Speaker 11>Ben Didn't know if he knew how to sprawl.</v>

6890
03:16:01.350 --> 03:16:03.960
<v Speaker 11>Like Dean Thomas doesn't know how to sprawl.</v>

6891
03:16:05.190 --> 03:16:06.023
<v Speaker 11>Wow.</v>

6892
03:16:06.150 --> 03:16:07.650
<v Speaker 11>That's how good he is though.</v>

6893
03:16:08.120 --> 03:16:08.953
<v Speaker 11>Right.</v>

6894
03:16:09.900 --> 03:16:11.040
<v Speaker 11>And how good he is.</v>

6895
03:16:11.070 --> 03:16:12.960
<v Speaker 11>Did you ever see when he rolled Marcello Garcia?</v>

6896
03:16:13.010 --> 03:16:13.843
<v Speaker 11>Yup.</v>

6897
03:16:13.930 --> 03:16:15.030
<v Speaker 11>Marsala just tap,</v>

6898
03:16:15.210 --> 03:16:15.481
<v Speaker 11>tap,</v>

6899
03:16:15.481 --> 03:16:15.751
<v Speaker 11>tap,</v>

6900
03:16:15.751 --> 03:16:16.584
<v Speaker 11>tap them.</v>

6901
03:16:16.940 --> 03:16:18.630
<v Speaker 11>Marcel is just so freakish,</v>

6902
03:16:19.100 --> 03:16:20.130
<v Speaker 11>you know his Jujitsu,</v>

6903
03:16:20.131 --> 03:16:21.720
<v Speaker 11>especially in his prime.</v>

6904
03:16:22.470 --> 03:16:23.460
<v Speaker 11>So Freakish.</v>

6905
03:16:24.170 --> 03:16:25.590
<v Speaker 11>Oh I saw that as a beast dude.</v>

6906
03:16:25.980 --> 03:16:26.813
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

6907
03:16:26.940 --> 03:16:31.940
<v Speaker 11>I was in Brazil when he emerged on the scene in 2003 when he fought a Shaolin</v>

6908
03:16:32.221 --> 03:16:32.940
<v Speaker 11>and choked him out.</v>

6909
03:16:32.940 --> 03:16:36.930
<v Speaker 11>He got his back and then in the rolling and spinning he put them to sleep.</v>

6910
03:16:37.230 --> 03:16:37.980
<v Speaker 11>Like as,</v>

6911
03:16:37.980 --> 03:16:40.020
<v Speaker 11>as Shalon was trying to defend,</v>

6912
03:16:40.350 --> 03:16:43.290
<v Speaker 11>he's getting his back and I believe he got them from the side.</v>

6913
03:16:43.500 --> 03:16:45.120
<v Speaker 11>I think he'd wind up like rear naked,</v>

6914
03:16:45.121 --> 03:16:48.210
<v Speaker 11>choke him from the side and that's how he put him to sleep.</v>

6915
03:16:48.420 --> 03:16:53.130
<v Speaker 11>But it was just Shaolin refusing to tap cause nobody even knew who Marcello was</v>

6916
03:16:53.131 --> 03:16:53.964
<v Speaker 11>back then.</v>

6917
03:16:54.600 --> 03:16:56.820
<v Speaker 11>And that was like one of his most impressive,</v>

6918
03:16:56.821 --> 03:17:01.821
<v Speaker 11>like early on victories like that to this day is one of my all time favorite</v>

6919
03:17:03.031 --> 03:17:06.180
<v Speaker 11>submission victories that I've ever seen anybody uh,</v>

6920
03:17:07.170 --> 03:17:12.170
<v Speaker 11>perform because it was just so explosive and fast and final put them to sleep.</v>

6921
03:17:14.430 --> 03:17:19.170
<v Speaker 11>It's very rarely see a high Lynn high level guy like Shaolin he barrow get put</v>

6922
03:17:19.171 --> 03:17:20.004
<v Speaker 11>to sleep,</v>

6923
03:17:20.610 --> 03:17:21.390
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

6924
03:17:21.390 --> 03:17:24.960
<v Speaker 11>and that was the first time we'd ever seen Marcello Shaolin was one of those</v>

6925
03:17:24.961 --> 03:17:25.794
<v Speaker 11>guys too.</v>

6926
03:17:25.920 --> 03:17:27.090
<v Speaker 11>Like when he came to MMA,</v>

6927
03:17:27.091 --> 03:17:28.620
<v Speaker 11>he was one of those dangerous guys.</v>

6928
03:17:28.710 --> 03:17:29.490
<v Speaker 11>Oh yeah.</v>

6929
03:17:29.490 --> 03:17:30.920
<v Speaker 11>Super high level grappler.</v>

6930
03:17:30.930 --> 03:17:31.763
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

6931
03:17:32.070 --> 03:17:32.581
<v Speaker 11>I mean,</v>

6932
03:17:32.581 --> 03:17:32.881
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>

6933
03:17:32.881 --> 03:17:35.220
<v Speaker 11>and this was the Abu Dhabi 2003.</v>

6934
03:17:35.430 --> 03:17:35.701
<v Speaker 11>Jamie.</v>

6935
03:17:35.701 --> 03:17:39.120
<v Speaker 11>See if you can find that Marcello Garcia vs Shaolin.</v>

6936
03:17:41.050 --> 03:17:41.461
<v Speaker 11>It's only,</v>

6937
03:17:41.461 --> 03:17:42.810
<v Speaker 11>it's not a fast fight.</v>

6938
03:17:42.960 --> 03:17:43.231
<v Speaker 11>I mean,</v>

6939
03:17:43.231 --> 03:17:44.430
<v Speaker 11>it's not a long fight at all,</v>

6940
03:17:44.910 --> 03:17:45.301
<v Speaker 11>I should say.</v>

6941
03:17:45.301 --> 03:17:46.920
<v Speaker 11>Match fighters get mad.</v>

6942
03:17:48.300 --> 03:17:49.590
<v Speaker 11>Jujitsu guys call it fights.</v>

6949
03:17:59.910 --> 03:18:01.430

6950
03:18:01.620 --> 03:18:02.400

<v Speaker 11>No,</v>

6977
03:18:35.970 --> 03:18:40.330
<v Speaker 11>the thing about Marcella was that arm drag to the back was just so unstoppable,</v>

6978
03:18:40.690 --> 03:18:42.130
<v Speaker 11>so unstoppable.</v>

6979
03:18:42.490 --> 03:18:43.810
<v Speaker 11>He would get to that position,</v>

6980
03:18:43.811 --> 03:18:44.081
<v Speaker 11>man.</v>

6981

6984
03:18:48.610 --> 03:18:52.900
<v Speaker 13>one hook and he's like on top on the side.</v>

6985
03:18:53.630 --> 03:18:55.660
<v Speaker 13>These get them spun around and flattened out.</v>

6986
03:18:56.310 --> 03:18:57.280
<v Speaker 13>Cheat back.</v>

<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

6988
03:18:58.270 --> 03:19:03.250
<v Speaker 13>He was chest to back and he act like he stopped him from rolling out of it</v>

6989
03:19:03.251 --> 03:19:04.084
<v Speaker 13>perfectly.</v>

6990
03:19:04.150 --> 03:19:05.140
<v Speaker 13>It was just death,</v>

6991
03:19:05.980 --> 03:19:09.430
<v Speaker 13>like the way spinning and trying to resolve.</v>

6992
03:19:09.431 --> 03:19:11.140
<v Speaker 13>Never at least have that chest the back.</v>

6993
03:19:11.141 --> 03:19:11.501
<v Speaker 13>No,</v>

6994
03:19:11.501 --> 03:19:11.980
<v Speaker 13>never.</v>

6995
03:19:11.980 --> 03:19:13.570
<v Speaker 13>He's squeeze something else,</v>

6996
03:19:13.571 --> 03:19:14.080
<v Speaker 13>man.</v>

6997
03:19:14.080 --> 03:19:14.913
<v Speaker 13>Oof.</v>

6998
03:19:15.010 --> 03:19:17.710
<v Speaker 13>That is one of my all time favorite submission victories,</v>

6999
03:19:18.010 --> 03:19:19.030
<v Speaker 13>but just because of the,</v>

7000
03:19:19.080 --> 03:19:20.830
<v Speaker 13>the finale to it,</v>

7001
03:19:20.831 --> 03:19:21.730
<v Speaker 13>but also the,</v>

7002
03:19:22.270 --> 03:19:24.550
<v Speaker 13>the fucking ruthlessness of his technique.</v>

7003
03:19:24.970 --> 03:19:26.680
<v Speaker 13>He had both things going on.</v>

7004
03:19:26.681 --> 03:19:27.101
<v Speaker 13>It was like,</v>

7005
03:19:27.101 --> 03:19:29.710
<v Speaker 13>he had an incredible technique and aggression</v>

7006
03:19:31.390 --> 03:19:32.680
<v Speaker 13>and perfect,</v>

7007
03:19:32.770 --> 03:19:34.870
<v Speaker 13>perfect timing and perfect positioning.</v>

7008
03:19:35.950 --> 03:19:36.783
<v Speaker 13>Fuck,</v>

7009
03:19:37.120 --> 03:19:37.953
<v Speaker 13>that's amazing.</v>

7010
03:19:38.020 --> 03:19:38.650
<v Speaker 13>And again,</v>

7011
03:19:38.650 --> 03:19:39.483
<v Speaker 13>Shaolin,</v>

7012
03:19:39.520 --> 03:19:40.630
<v Speaker 13>he did it to a beast,</v>

7013
03:19:41.010 --> 03:19:41.261
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

7014
03:19:41.261 --> 03:19:43.120
<v Speaker 13>it wasn't like to some regular person,</v>

7015
03:19:43.780 --> 03:19:44.141
<v Speaker 13>he was,</v>

7016
03:19:44.141 --> 03:19:44.380
<v Speaker 13>um,</v>

7017
03:19:44.380 --> 03:19:49.380
<v Speaker 13>he was at American top team for awhile and it sucks because like all my training</v>

7018
03:19:49.691 --> 03:19:50.650
<v Speaker 13>partners beat me up.</v>

7019
03:19:52.450 --> 03:19:56.710
<v Speaker 13>I'm training with myself that he's training for an MMA fight over in Japan and</v>

7020
03:19:56.711 --> 03:20:01.180
<v Speaker 13>I'm training for a fight and we're going and I'm keeping it standing.</v>

7021
03:20:01.181 --> 03:20:02.300
<v Speaker 13>I'm defending takedowns,</v>

7022
03:20:02.320 --> 03:20:06.730
<v Speaker 13>I'm winning the round and Conan goes 30 seconds and I'm like,</v>

7023
03:20:07.030 --> 03:20:07.870
<v Speaker 13>30 seconds.</v>

7024
03:20:07.871 --> 03:20:08.201
<v Speaker 13>Yeah,</v>

7025
03:20:08.201 --> 03:20:09.520
<v Speaker 13>I've dominated this round.</v>

7026
03:20:09.521 --> 03:20:09.911
<v Speaker 13>Okay,</v>

7027
03:20:09.911 --> 03:20:11.200
<v Speaker 13>now let me be strategic.</v>

7028
03:20:11.201 --> 03:20:12.130
<v Speaker 13>I'm gonna take him down,</v>

7029
03:20:12.250 --> 03:20:14.310
<v Speaker 13>secure the round and you know,</v>

7030
03:20:14.320 --> 03:20:15.190
<v Speaker 13>kind of put it out there.</v>

7031
03:20:15.191 --> 03:20:17.950
<v Speaker 13>This is the judges that I'm not afraid of his ground game,</v>

7032
03:20:18.110 --> 03:20:18.410
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

7033
03:20:18.410 --> 03:20:20.260
<v Speaker 13>just kind of playing the game in my head.</v>

7034
03:20:20.890 --> 03:20:25.890
<v Speaker 13>I shoot a shot and on the way down he reverses me and he taps me before the</v>

7035
03:20:25.931 --> 03:20:26.764
<v Speaker 13>round is over,</v>

7036
03:20:27.280 --> 03:20:28.113
<v Speaker 13>like</v>

7037
03:20:31.080 --> 03:20:31.913
<v Speaker 13>was like,</v>

7038
03:20:32.440 --> 03:20:33.910
<v Speaker 13>this is garbage.</v>

7039
03:20:34.000 --> 03:20:34.900
<v Speaker 13>This is bullshit.</v>

7040
03:20:37.100 --> 03:20:37.810
<v Speaker 13>He,</v>

7041
03:20:37.810 --> 03:20:39.580
<v Speaker 13>he's ridiculously good.</v>

7042
03:20:40.060 --> 03:20:41.350
<v Speaker 13>Is he the best guy you ever roll with?</v>

7043
03:20:41.380 --> 03:20:42.213
<v Speaker 13>Absolutely.</v>

7044
03:20:42.220 --> 03:20:43.150
<v Speaker 13>By far.</v>

7045
03:20:44.620 --> 03:20:45.453
<v Speaker 13>I mean,</v>

7046
03:20:45.490 --> 03:20:46.840
<v Speaker 13>Matt Lindland was like,</v>

7047
03:20:46.950 --> 03:20:47.290
<v Speaker 13>like,</v>

7048
03:20:47.290 --> 03:20:49.240
<v Speaker 13>I can't do anything that I got just a gorilla.</v>

7049
03:20:49.390 --> 03:20:50.500
<v Speaker 13>He's so,</v>

7050
03:20:50.501 --> 03:20:51.370
<v Speaker 13>he's so good.</v>

7051
03:20:52.360 --> 03:20:53.410
<v Speaker 13>He's really good,</v>

7052
03:20:56.200 --> 03:20:57.033
<v Speaker 13>man.</v>

7053
03:20:57.700 --> 03:20:58.533
<v Speaker 13>That's interesting.</v>

7054
03:20:59.000 --> 03:20:59.980
<v Speaker 13>That's really good.</v>

7055
03:21:00.070 --> 03:21:00.903
<v Speaker 13>Like,</v>

7056
03:21:01.300 --> 03:21:05.860
<v Speaker 13>like I would love to see him and Omega Madoff not necessarily in a fight,</v>

7057
03:21:05.890 --> 03:21:07.150
<v Speaker 13>just in a wrestling,</v>

7058
03:21:07.151 --> 03:21:08.180
<v Speaker 13>grappling situation.</v>

7059
03:21:08.181 --> 03:21:09.250
<v Speaker 13>Sambo situation.</v>

7060
03:21:09.251 --> 03:21:10.600
<v Speaker 13>I would just love to see that.</v>

7061
03:21:10.690 --> 03:21:11.523
<v Speaker 13>I don't know.</v>

7062
03:21:11.710 --> 03:21:13.390
<v Speaker 13>I've never trained with Tomago meadow of,</v>

7063
03:21:14.110 --> 03:21:15.400
<v Speaker 13>I don't know how good he is.</v>

7064
03:21:15.550 --> 03:21:17.710
<v Speaker 13>I'm sure he's great because of what he,</v>

7065
03:21:17.711 --> 03:21:18.550
<v Speaker 13>I seen him do,</v>

7066
03:21:19.030 --> 03:21:20.530
<v Speaker 13>but I would just love to see that.</v>

7067
03:21:20.531 --> 03:21:24.400
<v Speaker 13>I know his wrestling is probably the best in the UFC right now,</v>

7068
03:21:24.430 --> 03:21:26.450
<v Speaker 13>so I'm a guy like that,</v>

7069
03:21:26.480 --> 03:21:30.310
<v Speaker 13>but I know some really good wrestlers that get destroyed by Marcello.</v>

7070
03:21:30.470 --> 03:21:31.090
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

7071
03:21:31.090 --> 03:21:33.940
<v Speaker 13>Like Ben ask him like we were talking about in that video was actually rolling.</v>

7072
03:21:35.260 --> 03:21:35.890
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

7073
03:21:35.890 --> 03:21:38.680
<v Speaker 13>Well Marcello's got that fucking insane.</v>

7074
03:21:38.681 --> 03:21:39.610
<v Speaker 13>Squeeze man,</v>

7075
03:21:40.180 --> 03:21:41.530
<v Speaker 13>the guillotine squeeze.</v>

7076
03:21:41.740 --> 03:21:43.930
<v Speaker 13>He's got a nasty north south squeeze.</v>

7077
03:21:44.470 --> 03:21:46.040
<v Speaker 13>He's got his back</v>

7078
03:21:46.040 --> 03:21:47.630
<v Speaker 1>takings legendary.</v>

7079
03:21:47.650 --> 03:21:49.280
<v Speaker 1>His is so good at that arm drag.</v>

7080
03:21:50.330 --> 03:21:51.560
<v Speaker 1>That arm drag is just,</v>

7081
03:21:52.130 --> 03:21:54.050
<v Speaker 1>and before he was pulling it off,</v>

7082
03:21:54.051 --> 03:21:57.410
<v Speaker 1>like the way he was doing it was really rare to see somebody that specialized on</v>

7083
03:21:57.411 --> 03:22:01.100
<v Speaker 1>it like that or they just specialize on hey that arm drag and getting to the</v>

7084
03:22:01.101 --> 03:22:01.341
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

7085
03:22:01.341 --> 03:22:02.450
<v Speaker 1>hidden that arm drag to get to the back,</v>

7086
03:22:02.770 --> 03:22:03.310
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

7087
03:22:03.310 --> 03:22:04.910
<v Speaker 1>And then he's doing it from butterfly guard.</v>

7088
03:22:04.911 --> 03:22:05.570
<v Speaker 1>He was a,</v>

7089
03:22:05.570 --> 03:22:06.830
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't doing it like a wrestler.</v>

7090
03:22:07.640 --> 03:22:08.720
<v Speaker 1>Really interesting guy</v>

7092
03:22:13.220 --> 03:22:13.770

7093
03:22:13.770 --> 03:22:18.770
<v Speaker 1>You're not big arms like his arms are kind of normal sized big ass giant legs</v>

7094
03:22:20.030 --> 03:22:20.950

7099
03:22:30.260 --> 03:22:33.110
<v Speaker 1>That is one thing that I think is like super underrated.</v>

7100
03:22:33.470 --> 03:22:35.720
<v Speaker 1>It kind of in all of any,</v>

7101
03:22:35.721 --> 03:22:36.950
<v Speaker 1>any sort of combat sports,</v>

03:22:37.370 --> 03:22:40.370
<v Speaker 1>the size of your legs is so gigantic.</v>

7103
03:22:40.371 --> 03:22:42.020
<v Speaker 1>Like the power in your legs rather.</v>

7104
03:22:42.200 --> 03:22:45.200
<v Speaker 1>The ability that your legs have like look at Pac cow's legs,</v>

7105

<v Speaker 1>Like can you go back and think about Tyson?</v>

7119
03:23:13.780 --> 03:23:17.260
<v Speaker 1>One of the things about Tyson that was so fucking impressive is his legs.</v>

7120
03:23:17.590 --> 03:23:22.590
<v Speaker 1>He would leap at you and throw bombs at the same time and they're just coming up</v>

7121
03:23:22.661 --> 03:23:23.710
<v Speaker 1>from the ground.</v>

7122
03:23:25.150 --> 03:23:29.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's so much horsepower behind that and a lot of that was coming up</v>

7123
03:23:29.951 --> 03:23:31.870
<v Speaker 1>through those giant ass fucking legs.</v>

7124
03:23:35.020 --> 03:23:35.320
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

03:23:35.320 --> 03:23:35.661
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

7126
03:23:35.661 --> 03:23:38.190
<v Speaker 1>really interesting when you think about it from Marcel,</v>

7128
03:23:40.100 --> 03:23:41.510
<v Speaker 1>which guide guide the audience</v>

7129
03:23:43.510 --> 03:23:44.810
<v Speaker 1>would think about it with Marcella,</v>

7130
03:23:44.811 --> 03:23:47.330
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting is he's securing you with those legs.</v>

7131
03:23:47.840 --> 03:23:49.370
<v Speaker 1>Like when he's taking backs.</v>

7132
03:23:49.371 --> 03:23:50.450
<v Speaker 1>Like that's his big thing,</v>

7133
03:23:50.451 --> 03:23:50.721
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

7134
03:23:50.721 --> 03:23:52.070
<v Speaker 1>And then get teens as well.</v>

7135
03:23:52.340 --> 03:23:53.450
<v Speaker 1>He's using those,</v>

7136
03:23:53.451 --> 03:23:58.451
<v Speaker 1>that incredible leg power to secure you to secure you and to get you controlled</v>

7137
03:24:00.111 --> 03:24:00.921
<v Speaker 1>by those lay.</v>

7138
03:24:00.921 --> 03:24:01.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7139
03:24:01.460 --> 03:24:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Like you see the way control Shaolin on the ground,</v>

7140
03:24:03.540 --> 03:24:04.373
<v Speaker 1>the end of it.</v>

7141
03:24:04.430 --> 03:24:06.020
<v Speaker 1>He's a smushing everything.</v>

7142
03:24:06.440 --> 03:24:09.500
<v Speaker 1>It's all that power that allows him to get the chokes off better.</v>

7143
03:24:10.190 --> 03:24:10.581
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

7144
03:24:10.581 --> 03:24:11.391
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's,</v>

7145
03:24:11.391 --> 03:24:13.010
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things where he's,</v>

7146
03:24:13.011 --> 03:24:18.011
<v Speaker 1>he's figured out just how to use exactly the right amount of muscle in the right</v>

7147
03:24:18.621 --> 03:24:21.350
<v Speaker 1>direction to control you with his leg.</v>

7148
03:24:21.420 --> 03:24:22.570
<v Speaker 1>Like using his legs.</v>

7149
03:24:22.600 --> 03:24:24.090
<v Speaker 1>His a hand grab.</v>

7150
03:24:24.280 --> 03:24:25.113
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7151
03:24:25.740 --> 03:24:27.800
<v Speaker 1>But like same thing with like a specialist,</v>

7152
03:24:27.801 --> 03:24:28.710
<v Speaker 1>like no Madoff.</v>

7153
03:24:28.730 --> 03:24:30.500
<v Speaker 1>Same thing with a specialist like Damien Maia.</v>

7154
03:24:30.501 --> 03:24:35.501
<v Speaker 1>I feel like they have that ability to change the little details and use them,</v>

7155
03:24:36.170 --> 03:24:40.400
<v Speaker 1>use their body the perfect way to make that specific thing work.</v>

7156
03:24:40.850 --> 03:24:41.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7157
03:24:41.061 --> 03:24:44.370
<v Speaker 1>You know the other thing that's interesting about Marcel is he doesn't,</v>

7158
03:24:44.910 --> 03:24:49.380
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't utilize any strong person moves like you won't do Camorra's.</v>

7159
03:24:49.770 --> 03:24:51.900
<v Speaker 1>He thinks Camorra's are a strong person move.</v>

7160
03:24:52.590 --> 03:24:55.320
<v Speaker 1>He things like grabbing the Garmin Yankton behind him.</v>

7161
03:24:55.350 --> 03:24:58.170
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't do those or at least he didn't for a long time.</v>

7162
03:24:58.171 --> 03:24:59.100
<v Speaker 1>And that was his rationale.</v>

7163
03:24:59.320 --> 03:25:01.710
<v Speaker 1>He might've changed and went to it now,</v>

7164
03:25:01.860 --> 03:25:04.050
<v Speaker 1>but I know for the longest time it wasn't interested in those.</v>

7165
03:25:04.200 --> 03:25:06.440
<v Speaker 1>He was just interested in putting motherfuckers to sleep.</v>

7166
03:25:07.100 --> 03:25:08.910
<v Speaker 1>Like he's like,</v>

7167
03:25:08.940 --> 03:25:09.480
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>

7168
03:25:09.480 --> 03:25:10.291
<v Speaker 1>Like all the,</v>

7169
03:25:10.291 --> 03:25:12.150
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do is get ahold of that neck.</v>

7170
03:25:12.150 --> 03:25:14.790
<v Speaker 1>And if I become a specialist in squeezing next,</v>

7171
03:25:14.940 --> 03:25:16.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm just gonna put everybody to sleep.</v>

7172
03:25:16.141 --> 03:25:18.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to be messing up your shoulder or anything.</v>

7173
03:25:18.690 --> 03:25:19.800
<v Speaker 1>I'll just shut you off.</v>

7174
03:25:20.130 --> 03:25:20.341
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

7175
03:25:20.341 --> 03:25:21.750
<v Speaker 1>it's the most def def,</v>

7176
03:25:21.960 --> 03:25:24.570
<v Speaker 1>like a guy can tap you and it's very definitive.</v>

7177
03:25:24.571 --> 03:25:25.110
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

7178
03:25:25.110 --> 03:25:26.690
<v Speaker 1>The guy gets you in an arm bar and Tab.</v>

7179
03:25:26.820 --> 03:25:27.653
<v Speaker 1>It's very definitive,</v>

7180
03:25:27.900 --> 03:25:30.810
<v Speaker 1>but there's something about the way climbs off shall Shaolin and challenge his</v>

7181
03:25:30.811 --> 03:25:34.650
<v Speaker 1>unconscious and he just scrolls him out in seconds.</v>

7182
03:25:35.040 --> 03:25:36.960
<v Speaker 1>It's the most definitive ending next to,</v>

7183
03:25:37.380 --> 03:25:38.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously next to a knockout,</v>

7184
03:25:39.510 --> 03:25:40.830
<v Speaker 1>knockout being the most definitive.</v>

7185
03:25:40.831 --> 03:25:41.011
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

7186
03:25:41.011 --> 03:25:42.990
<v Speaker 1>Because it carries the most consequences.</v>

7187
03:25:43.230 --> 03:25:44.063
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7188
03:25:44.130 --> 03:25:44.551
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

7189
03:25:44.551 --> 03:25:45.210
<v Speaker 1>they both,</v>

7190
03:25:45.210 --> 03:25:46.520
<v Speaker 1>they both put you to sleep,</v>

7191
03:25:46.530 --> 03:25:47.430
<v Speaker 1>devote real life.</v>

7192
03:25:47.870 --> 03:25:48.660
<v Speaker 1>Like you're dead.</v>

7193
03:25:48.660 --> 03:25:49.493
<v Speaker 1>You're dead,</v>

7194
03:25:49.590 --> 03:25:50.423
<v Speaker 1>you're dead.</v>

7195
03:25:50.910 --> 03:25:51.743
<v Speaker 1>That's no,</v>

7196
03:25:51.900 --> 03:25:53.250
<v Speaker 1>that's legitimate.</v>

7197
03:25:53.251 --> 03:25:54.240
<v Speaker 1>Like that would kill you.</v>

7198
03:25:54.420 --> 03:25:55.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7199
03:25:55.240 --> 03:25:55.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7200
03:25:55.960 --> 03:25:57.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh Oh,</v>

7201
03:25:57.390 --> 03:26:00.970
<v Speaker 1>Marcel would have to do is keep hanging on for another 30 seconds.</v>

7202
03:26:01.000 --> 03:26:01.980
<v Speaker 1>Second dead guy over.</v>

7203
03:26:01.981 --> 03:26:02.641
<v Speaker 1>No referee.</v>

7204
03:26:02.641 --> 03:26:03.390
<v Speaker 1>It's over.</v>

7205
03:26:03.390 --> 03:26:03.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7206
03:26:03.720 --> 03:26:03.991
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

7207
03:26:03.991 --> 03:26:04.621
<v Speaker 1>he just climbed.</v>

7208
03:26:04.621 --> 03:26:08.560
<v Speaker 1>And the crazy thing is he just did that to a worldclass blackbelt yeah,</v>

7209
03:26:10.140 --> 03:26:10.973
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

7210
03:26:10.980 --> 03:26:11.251
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

7211
03:26:11.251 --> 03:26:11.671
<v Speaker 1>It's this,</v>

7212
03:26:11.671 --> 03:26:11.881
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

7213
03:26:11.881 --> 03:26:12.714
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

7214
03:26:12.900 --> 03:26:13.320
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

7215
03:26:13.320 --> 03:26:15.460
<v Speaker 1>those people that,</v>

7216
03:26:15.461 --> 03:26:17.090
<v Speaker 1>that work for Hillary Clinton,</v>

7217
03:26:17.120 --> 03:26:19.440
<v Speaker 1>they put the inject you to put you to sleep,</v>

7218
03:26:20.780 --> 03:26:22.430
<v Speaker 1>but when you're out you can go,</v>

7219
03:26:22.470 --> 03:26:23.700
<v Speaker 1>they can take you somewhere.</v>

7220
03:26:23.701 --> 03:26:24.870
<v Speaker 1>So when you get knocked out,</v>

7221
03:26:24.871 --> 03:26:26.190
<v Speaker 1>when you get choked unconscious,</v>

7222
03:26:26.191 --> 03:26:26.671
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

7223
03:26:26.671 --> 03:26:26.881
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

7224
03:26:26.881 --> 03:26:27.630
<v Speaker 1>you're dead.</v>

7225
03:26:27.630 --> 03:26:27.841
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

7226
03:26:27.841 --> 03:26:28.980
<v Speaker 1>you are at their mercy.</v>

7227
03:26:28.981 --> 03:26:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely nothing you can do about whatever they wanted to do to you.</v>

7228
03:26:34.020 --> 03:26:37.110
<v Speaker 1>Why do you gotta bring in Hillary Clinton and interject and people</v>

7229
03:26:39.320 --> 03:26:40.153
<v Speaker 1>talking about</v>

7230
03:26:42.080 --> 03:26:42.913
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>

7231
03:26:43.410 --> 03:26:44.640
<v Speaker 1>about the Trump thing.</v>

7232
03:26:44.670 --> 03:26:45.390
<v Speaker 1>And I just want,</v>

7233
03:26:45.390 --> 03:26:47.760
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to put it out there that I'm against them both though.</v>

7234
03:26:47.761 --> 03:26:49.440
<v Speaker 1>So I don't want anybody coming after me.</v>

7235
03:26:49.441 --> 03:26:50.330
<v Speaker 1>I had to say first.</v>

7236
03:26:50.350 --> 03:26:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7237
03:26:51.090 --> 03:26:51.660
<v Speaker 1>Joe Schilling.</v>

7238
03:26:51.660 --> 03:26:52.180
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

7239
03:26:52.180 --> 03:26:53.310
<v Speaker 1>You know these guys very well.</v>

7240
03:26:53.311 --> 03:26:54.040
<v Speaker 1>Dustin Jacola.</v>

7241
03:26:54.040 --> 03:26:54.900
<v Speaker 1>Simon Marcus.</v>

7242
03:26:54.990 --> 03:26:56.250
<v Speaker 1>Big Step up for Jacoby though,</v>

7243
03:26:56.251 --> 03:26:56.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

7244
03:26:56.990 --> 03:26:57.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7245
03:26:57.540 --> 03:26:59.190
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the biggest step up for him.</v>

7246
03:26:59.490 --> 03:27:00.960
<v Speaker 1>I think they already fought once.</v>

7247
03:27:00.961 --> 03:27:01.794
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

7248
03:27:02.370 --> 03:27:03.320
<v Speaker 1>Did he rematch?</v>

7249
03:27:04.460 --> 03:27:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Like here we go and that way.</v>

7250
03:27:06.590 --> 03:27:07.423
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7251
03:27:07.500 --> 03:27:07.840
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

7252
03:27:07.840 --> 03:27:08.220
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

7253
03:27:08.220 --> 03:27:09.001
<v Speaker 1>Dustin's not,</v>

7254
03:27:09.001 --> 03:27:11.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Dustin's who won the first fight.</v>

7255
03:27:11.790 --> 03:27:12.330
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even want,</v>

7256
03:27:12.330 --> 03:27:15.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean once the first did Simon when 71 yet.</v>

7257
03:27:16.200 --> 03:27:17.033
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how he won?</v>

7258
03:27:18.030 --> 03:27:18.863
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

7259
03:27:20.160 --> 03:27:25.160
<v Speaker 1>There was the Brazilian guy who k owed Jacola Jacoby with a left hook.</v>

7260
03:27:25.700 --> 03:27:26.850
<v Speaker 1>I remember that Jacoby.</v>

7261
03:27:26.851 --> 03:27:27.420
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

7262
03:27:27.420 --> 03:27:28.110
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>

7263
03:27:28.110 --> 03:27:33.110
<v Speaker 1>And first he fought it two oh five with glory and lost like five or six fights.</v>

7264
03:27:33.850 --> 03:27:35.580
<v Speaker 1>He was fighting a long time.</v>

7265
03:27:35.581 --> 03:27:35.850
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

7266
03:27:35.850 --> 03:27:36.683
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7267
03:27:37.160 --> 03:27:40.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean went to one at 85 and uh,</v>

7268
03:27:41.100 --> 03:27:42.010
<v Speaker 1>knock out two</v>

7269
03:27:42.010 --> 03:27:42.843
<v Speaker 11>months.</v>

7270
03:27:43.030 --> 03:27:43.181
<v Speaker 11>Oh,</v>

7271
03:27:43.181 --> 03:27:43.480
<v Speaker 11>nice.</v>

7272
03:27:43.480 --> 03:27:44.313
<v Speaker 11>Push Turkey.</v>

7273
03:27:47.020 --> 03:27:51.640
<v Speaker 11>He's definitely got a lot better as a striker since he's been concentrating</v>

7274
03:27:51.641 --> 03:27:52.540
<v Speaker 11>entirely on it.</v>

7275
03:27:53.050 --> 03:27:53.190
<v Speaker 11>Oh.</v>

7276
03:27:53.190 --> 03:27:54.140
<v Speaker 11>So there it is a,</v>

7277
03:27:54.170 --> 03:27:56.440
<v Speaker 11>there's a decision Simon Marcus wanted decision.</v>

7278
03:27:57.760 --> 03:27:58.900
<v Speaker 11>That was the first fight they had.</v>

7279
03:27:59.140 --> 03:27:59.321
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

7280
03:27:59.321 --> 03:27:59.810
<v Speaker 11>I would say if,</v>

7281
03:27:59.810 --> 03:28:01.270
<v Speaker 11>if Jacoby has a,</v>

7282
03:28:01.271 --> 03:28:06.271
<v Speaker 11>has a best chance of winning this fight now than there because of the high</v>

7283
03:28:06.551 --> 03:28:07.384
<v Speaker 11>altitude.</v>

7284
03:28:07.930 --> 03:28:08.331
<v Speaker 11>Uh,</v>

7285
03:28:08.331 --> 03:28:09.970
<v Speaker 11>and he's a a Colorado guy.</v>

7286
03:28:10.000 --> 03:28:10.211
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

7287
03:28:10.211 --> 03:28:11.140
<v Speaker 11>He lives in Colorado.</v>

7288
03:28:11.800 --> 03:28:12.800
<v Speaker 11>And then do you,</v>

7289
03:28:12.940 --> 03:28:16.750
<v Speaker 11>how much of a fact do you think Simon Mark is just losing by Kao to Jason?</v>

7290
03:28:16.751 --> 03:28:17.320
<v Speaker 11>Wilderness?</v>

7291
03:28:17.320 --> 03:28:20.150
<v Speaker 11>Is was not that long ago.</v>

7292
03:28:20.560 --> 03:28:21.211
<v Speaker 11>I don't think so.</v>

7293
03:28:21.211 --> 03:28:22.210
<v Speaker 11>It was like two months ago.</v>

7294
03:28:23.540 --> 03:28:24.540
<v Speaker 11>Right.</v>

7295
03:28:24.640 --> 03:28:25.450
<v Speaker 11>Um,</v>

7296
03:28:25.450 --> 03:28:28.420
<v Speaker 11>it couldn't have been more than three you don't think.</v>

7297
03:28:28.850 --> 03:28:29.890
<v Speaker 11>And he was out out.</v>

7298
03:28:30.490 --> 03:28:31.600
<v Speaker 11>He got beat up.</v>

7299
03:28:31.720 --> 03:28:32.560
<v Speaker 11>They stopped it,</v>

7300
03:28:32.590 --> 03:28:33.710
<v Speaker 11>but he got beat up.</v>

7301
03:28:33.870 --> 03:28:34.720
<v Speaker 11>He was fucked up.</v>

7302
03:28:35.170 --> 03:28:37.650
<v Speaker 11>He got hurt and he got dropped once.</v>

7303
03:28:38.050 --> 03:28:40.330
<v Speaker 11>He got dropped more than once that six weeks ago.</v>

7304
03:28:40.370 --> 03:28:41.203
<v Speaker 11>Wow.</v>

7305
03:28:41.470 --> 03:28:43.760
<v Speaker 11>And that was six weeks out to the socks.</v>

7306
03:28:45.590 --> 03:28:47.320
<v Speaker 11>He's flinching a lot of factors.</v>

7307
03:28:47.330 --> 03:28:47.560
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

7308
03:28:47.560 --> 03:28:49.450
<v Speaker 11>He doesn't look a calm,</v>

7309
03:28:49.460 --> 03:28:50.293
<v Speaker 11>comfortable.</v>

7310
03:28:51.040 --> 03:28:52.180
<v Speaker 11>And Dustin is a big,</v>

7311
03:28:52.390 --> 03:28:53.223
<v Speaker 11>big guy.</v>

7312
03:28:54.430 --> 03:28:55.960
<v Speaker 11>I feel like he's going to get knocked out.</v>

7313
03:28:56.080 --> 03:28:56.531
<v Speaker 11>I'll tell you what,</v>

7314
03:28:56.531 --> 03:28:58.780
<v Speaker 11>in the first round in the wilderness fight,</v>

7315
03:28:58.781 --> 03:29:00.400
<v Speaker 11>he looked like a fucking world beater.</v>

7316
03:29:00.460 --> 03:29:01.300
<v Speaker 11>He really did.</v>

7317
03:29:01.900 --> 03:29:02.381
<v Speaker 11>And Oh,</v>

7318
03:29:02.381 --> 03:29:03.214
<v Speaker 11>we just got tagged.</v>

7319
03:29:03.550 --> 03:29:04.930
<v Speaker 11>But he looked like a world beater.</v>

7320
03:29:04.931 --> 03:29:06.700
<v Speaker 11>When you fly you in the first round too.</v>

7321
03:29:06.970 --> 03:29:07.331
<v Speaker 11>I mean,</v>

7322
03:29:07.331 --> 03:29:08.560
<v Speaker 11>he's got a fur,</v>

7323
03:29:08.620 --> 03:29:11.260
<v Speaker 11>he's got a first gear that's pretty fucking sensational.</v>

7324
03:29:11.500 --> 03:29:11.651
<v Speaker 11>I mean,</v>

7325
03:29:11.651 --> 03:29:12.061
<v Speaker 11>he's a,</v>

7326
03:29:12.061 --> 03:29:12.894
<v Speaker 11>he's a,</v>

7327
03:29:13.370 --> 03:29:14.940
<v Speaker 11>he's a traditional Muy Thai guy.</v>

7328
03:29:14.941 --> 03:29:16.120
<v Speaker 11>Some with all of his fights.</v>

7329
03:29:16.121 --> 03:29:19.780
<v Speaker 11>He's got 49 fights there were all Muy Thai and like where he beat me the first</v>

7330
03:29:19.781 --> 03:29:24.640
<v Speaker 11>two times as he's like incredibly strong and good in the clinch and we'll like</v>

7331
03:29:24.670 --> 03:29:29.670
<v Speaker 11>zap you and hold you and right hand clench or he just tagged on.</v>

7332
03:29:30.730 --> 03:29:31.530
<v Speaker 11>So um,</v>

7333
03:29:31.530 --> 03:29:31.870
<v Speaker 11>the,</v>

7334
03:29:31.870 --> 03:29:35.200
<v Speaker 11>the clinch is really the fact that it's removed from Gloria really hurts him.</v>

7335
03:29:35.650 --> 03:29:36.220
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

7336
03:29:36.220 --> 03:29:36.970
<v Speaker 11>And his,</v>

7337
03:29:36.970 --> 03:29:38.590
<v Speaker 11>well it forces him to have to fight.</v>

7338
03:29:40.770 --> 03:29:41.860
<v Speaker 11>That's really interesting.</v>

7339
03:29:41.980 --> 03:29:43.030
<v Speaker 11>He used to uh,</v>

7340
03:29:45.130 --> 03:29:47.500
<v Speaker 11>it's cardio look better because he had more time to clench.</v>

7341
03:29:47.530 --> 03:29:48.700
<v Speaker 11>Now when it's full,</v>

7342
03:29:48.701 --> 03:29:50.710
<v Speaker 11>go and throw him where a combinations,</v>

7343
03:29:50.860 --> 03:29:53.830
<v Speaker 11>well that's interesting too because he has to completely change his style.</v>

7344
03:29:53.860 --> 03:29:57.700
<v Speaker 11>Like is his cardio is sort of based on the style of being able to hold on</v>

7345
03:29:57.701 --> 03:29:59.820
<v Speaker 11>whenever you want to like that.</v>

7346
03:30:00.190 --> 03:30:03.340
<v Speaker 11>That's why he was able to get away with those explosive movements and not,</v>

7347
03:30:03.520 --> 03:30:04.930
<v Speaker 11>not conserve energy.</v>

7348
03:30:05.080 --> 03:30:05.913
<v Speaker 11>Right.</v>

7349
03:30:06.220 --> 03:30:09.460
<v Speaker 11>Cause he could explode like that and they could clench up when he needed that</v>

7350
03:30:09.461 --> 03:30:11.290
<v Speaker 11>time to clench up and he's very strong.</v>

7351
03:30:12.490 --> 03:30:13.323
<v Speaker 11>Right.</v>

7352
03:30:13.540 --> 03:30:14.410
<v Speaker 11>That's interesting.</v>

7353
03:30:16.150 --> 03:30:18.500
<v Speaker 11>What did you prefer this or do you prefer more Thai?</v>

7354
03:30:18.720 --> 03:30:21.460
<v Speaker 11>I for the glory rose really for myself.</v>

7355
03:30:21.790 --> 03:30:23.440
<v Speaker 11>If you got to make the ultimate roles though,</v>

7356
03:30:23.441 --> 03:30:24.041
<v Speaker 11>what would you,</v>

7357
03:30:24.041 --> 03:30:26.740
<v Speaker 11>what would you sell a Duke Gloria rules with elbows.</v>

7358
03:30:26.830 --> 03:30:27.191
<v Speaker 11>Ah,</v>

7359
03:30:27.191 --> 03:30:27.420
<v Speaker 11>they,</v>

7360
03:30:27.420 --> 03:30:28.330
<v Speaker 11>I like the way of thinking,</v>

7361
03:30:28.720 --> 03:30:29.710
<v Speaker 11>but what about the clinch?</v>

7362
03:30:30.160 --> 03:30:30.831
<v Speaker 11>I think in the clinch,</v>

7363
03:30:30.831 --> 03:30:32.310
<v Speaker 11>just like a use,</v>

7364
03:30:34.470 --> 03:30:35.620
<v Speaker 11>the way you see it,</v>

7365
03:30:36.160 --> 03:30:38.980
<v Speaker 11>the way that you liked the clench as the way that it is here.</v>

7366
03:30:39.110 --> 03:30:39.980
<v Speaker 11>Just don't realize it,</v>

7367
03:30:39.980 --> 03:30:40.510
<v Speaker 3>but if you want,</v>

7368
03:30:40.510 --> 03:30:41.700
<v Speaker 3>if I showed you one aside,</v>

7369
03:30:41.740 --> 03:30:43.100
<v Speaker 3>what if I showed you Simon and I,</v>

7370
03:30:43.101 --> 03:30:48.101
<v Speaker 3>his second fight where he held onto me for two minutes out of every round up</v>

7371
03:30:48.171 --> 03:30:51.080
<v Speaker 3>against the ropes and nothing was happening and I was just sitting there getting</v>

7372
03:30:51.081 --> 03:30:54.170
<v Speaker 3>squeezed and I'm talking to Steve Mazzagatti like,</v>

7373
03:30:54.171 --> 03:30:54.321
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

7374
03:30:54.321 --> 03:30:55.400
<v Speaker 3>nothing's happening here.</v>

7375
03:30:55.790 --> 03:30:56.181
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't,</v>

7376
03:30:56.181 --> 03:30:57.140
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't like it that much.</v>

7377
03:30:57.400 --> 03:30:58.310
<v Speaker 3>I might have broke his arm,</v>

7378
03:30:58.311 --> 03:30:59.144
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

7379
03:31:00.510 --> 03:31:01.343
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

7380
03:31:01.400 --> 03:31:02.420
<v Speaker 1>they're going to stop the fight.</v>

7381
03:31:03.330 --> 03:31:05.720
<v Speaker 1>It looks like he broke his arm like Kik.</v>

7382
03:31:06.200 --> 03:31:07.033
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

7383
03:31:07.040 --> 03:31:07.311
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7384
03:31:07.311 --> 03:31:10.070
<v Speaker 1>They just squoze his arm and he's a pain.</v>

7385
03:31:11.780 --> 03:31:14.030
<v Speaker 1>Now he's getting off the stool is left arm.</v>

7386
03:31:14.031 --> 03:31:15.080
<v Speaker 1>It's fucked up,</v>

7387
03:31:15.081 --> 03:31:15.770
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

7388
03:31:15.770 --> 03:31:17.030
<v Speaker 1>What does Simon Marcus,</v>

7389
03:31:17.390 --> 03:31:18.410
<v Speaker 1>what is going on here?</v>

7390
03:31:18.580 --> 03:31:19.413
<v Speaker 1>It's not there.</v>

7391
03:31:19.490 --> 03:31:21.620
<v Speaker 1>The doctor's going to come over and look at this fights over.</v>

7392
03:31:21.740 --> 03:31:23.930
<v Speaker 1>He's got a broken arm where he keeps like,</v>

7393
03:31:23.931 --> 03:31:25.490
<v Speaker 1>you can't like the fight is over.</v>

7394
03:31:25.730 --> 03:31:26.450
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

7395
03:31:26.450 --> 03:31:27.051
<v Speaker 1>What are they gonna do?</v>

7396
03:31:27.051 --> 03:31:27.471
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna say,</v>

7397
03:31:27.471 --> 03:31:28.010
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

7398
03:31:28.010 --> 03:31:28.310
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

7399
03:31:28.310 --> 03:31:29.143
<v Speaker 1>go in there.</v>

7400
03:31:29.810 --> 03:31:31.310
<v Speaker 1>What do they do when they're stuck in Joe?</v>

7401
03:31:31.430 --> 03:31:31.881
<v Speaker 1>Well he's,</v>

7402
03:31:31.881 --> 03:31:32.151
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

7403
03:31:32.151 --> 03:31:32.871
<v Speaker 1>he's in pain.</v>

7404
03:31:32.871 --> 03:31:33.390
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

7405
03:31:33.390 --> 03:31:34.820
<v Speaker 1>So here's the thing.</v>

7406
03:31:35.000 --> 03:31:35.241
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

7407
03:31:35.241 --> 03:31:35.420
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

7408
03:31:35.420 --> 03:31:36.253
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm saying,</v>

7409
03:31:36.320 --> 03:31:38.210
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't they just have already started the round?</v>

7410
03:31:38.540 --> 03:31:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Like Simon had done some damage.</v>

7411
03:31:40.191 --> 03:31:40.670
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

7412
03:31:40.670 --> 03:31:44.150
<v Speaker 1>Would the idea be that either you are capable of starting at the beginning of</v>

7413
03:31:44.151 --> 03:31:45.440
<v Speaker 1>the round or the fights over?</v>

7414
03:31:48.140 --> 03:31:48.973
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

7415
03:31:49.850 --> 03:31:50.683
<v Speaker 1>it's broken.</v>

7416
03:31:54.010 --> 03:31:54.920
<v Speaker 1>They're still deciding.</v>

7417
03:31:57.190 --> 03:31:57.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7418
03:31:57.341 --> 03:31:58.400
<v Speaker 1>He's saying we've got to stop the fight.</v>

7419
03:31:58.401 --> 03:31:59.051
<v Speaker 1>It must be broken.</v>

7420
03:31:59.051 --> 03:31:59.501
<v Speaker 1>He could feel it.</v>

7421
03:31:59.501 --> 03:32:00.130
<v Speaker 1>It's broken.</v>

7422
03:32:00.130 --> 03:32:05.130
<v Speaker 1>But my question is how do you start the round and then have the guy have,</v>

7423
03:32:06.160 --> 03:32:07.690
<v Speaker 1>have them get checked out like that.</v>

7424
03:32:07.840 --> 03:32:09.250
<v Speaker 1>Like what if he can,</v>

7425
03:32:09.340 --> 03:32:10.750
<v Speaker 1>if he can't go on,</v>

7426
03:32:10.900 --> 03:32:11.231
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you,</v>

7427
03:32:11.231 --> 03:32:11.861
<v Speaker 1>can't continue.</v>

7428
03:32:11.861 --> 03:32:12.491
<v Speaker 1>You can't continue.</v>

7429
03:32:12.491 --> 03:32:17.410
<v Speaker 1>It seems like if he decided like I can go on two minutes later,</v>

7430
03:32:17.860 --> 03:32:19.720
<v Speaker 1>it's not really a foul that was committed.</v>

7431
03:32:19.721 --> 03:32:22.720
<v Speaker 1>It's not like he kicked him in the balls like in the Henderson Bisping fight.</v>

7432
03:32:22.930 --> 03:32:23.171
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

7433
03:32:23.171 --> 03:32:24.010
<v Speaker 1>There was a big deal.</v>

7434
03:32:24.310 --> 03:32:25.870
<v Speaker 1>Bisbing kicked Henderson the balls.</v>

7435
03:32:25.871 --> 03:32:27.520
<v Speaker 1>Henderson took a gang of time.</v>

7436
03:32:27.521 --> 03:32:27.791
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

7437
03:32:27.791 --> 03:32:28.031
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

7438
03:32:28.031 --> 03:32:28.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna take a break.</v>

7439
03:32:29.290 --> 03:32:31.840
<v Speaker 1>And it was a smart move to do that,</v>

7440
03:32:31.841 --> 03:32:32.680
<v Speaker 1>but that made sense.</v>

7441
03:32:32.681 --> 03:32:33.401
<v Speaker 1>He deserved that.</v>

7442
03:32:33.401 --> 03:32:34.270
<v Speaker 1>He got kicked in the balls.</v>

7443
03:32:35.650 --> 03:32:36.131
<v Speaker 1>He didn't,</v>

7444
03:32:36.131 --> 03:32:37.300
<v Speaker 1>Simon didn't do anything wrong.</v>

7445
03:32:37.480 --> 03:32:40.840
<v Speaker 1>He landed kicks and he heard the dude's arm and then they're like,</v>

7446
03:32:40.841 --> 03:32:40.961
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

7447
03:32:40.961 --> 03:32:42.160
<v Speaker 1>how bad is he hurt?</v>

7448
03:32:42.161 --> 03:32:43.180
<v Speaker 1>Can we Kenny go on?</v>

7449
03:32:43.300 --> 03:32:43.421
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7450
03:32:43.421 --> 03:32:45.430
<v Speaker 1>if he can't go on at the beginning of the round,</v>

7451
03:32:46.240 --> 03:32:46.770
<v Speaker 1>then you,</v>

7452
03:32:46.770 --> 03:32:47.530
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't dis,</v>

7453
03:32:47.530 --> 03:32:48.460
<v Speaker 1>the fight should be stopped.</v>

7454
03:32:48.461 --> 03:32:48.691
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

7455
03:32:48.691 --> 03:32:49.180
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

7456
03:32:49.180 --> 03:32:49.421
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7457
03:32:49.421 --> 03:32:50.930
<v Speaker 1>But did he ask for help?</v>

7458
03:32:50.931 --> 03:32:54.730
<v Speaker 1>What did he get above this dual ready to fight and then he ran for re decided to</v>

7459
03:32:54.800 --> 03:32:55.810
<v Speaker 1>to call the doctor.</v>

7460
03:32:55.870 --> 03:32:57.730
<v Speaker 1>I would have to be real clear.</v>

7461
03:32:57.731 --> 03:32:58.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

7462
03:32:58.330 --> 03:33:00.730
<v Speaker 1>I think when they were grabbing his arm in the corner,</v>

7463
03:33:00.731 --> 03:33:02.500
<v Speaker 1>I could have sworn he was telling them.</v>

7464
03:33:02.501 --> 03:33:03.334
<v Speaker 1>It was broken.</v>

7465
03:33:03.360 --> 03:33:04.193
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

7466
03:33:04.750 --> 03:33:07.810
<v Speaker 1>and then he got up and then maybe they had informed the referee.</v>

7467
03:33:07.840 --> 03:33:09.880
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there was some confusion in that regard.</v>

7468
03:33:10.270 --> 03:33:11.081
<v Speaker 1>The referee was like,</v>

7469
03:33:11.081 --> 03:33:11.291
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

7470
03:33:11.291 --> 03:33:13.030
<v Speaker 1>well we go to the doctor to see this.</v>

7471
03:33:14.280 --> 03:33:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

7472
03:33:14.710 --> 03:33:18.040
<v Speaker 1>But you can't know ordinarily that can't happen.</v>

7473
03:33:18.040 --> 03:33:18.221
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

7474
03:33:18.221 --> 03:33:20.000
<v Speaker 1>Like that was the big issue with the DOL.</v>

7475
03:33:20.010 --> 03:33:21.400
<v Speaker 1>We're Barrow Tim Kennedy Fight,</v>

7476
03:33:21.401 --> 03:33:21.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

7477
03:33:21.670 --> 03:33:22.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7478
03:33:22.090 --> 03:33:23.690
<v Speaker 1>Tim Kennedy hurts you all.</v>

7479
03:33:23.700 --> 03:33:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Romero has been badly hurt.</v>

7480
03:33:26.020 --> 03:33:29.620
<v Speaker 1>The round ends and the Ramiro stays on a stool for a long time.</v>

7481
03:33:29.920 --> 03:33:33.910
<v Speaker 1>He stayed on a stool for the full minute and then stayed on his stool at the end</v>

7482
03:33:33.911 --> 03:33:36.580
<v Speaker 1>of the round and just stayed there and looked at John McCarthy.</v>

7483
03:33:37.110 --> 03:33:39.420
<v Speaker 1>They cleared out the corner and it took like a long time.</v>

7484
03:33:39.690 --> 03:33:42.180
<v Speaker 1>I forget like what all the shenanigans where that was going on,</v>

7485
03:33:42.181 --> 03:33:46.350
<v Speaker 1>but it was clear that he had been hurt and then time was of the essence and they</v>

7486
03:33:46.351 --> 03:33:47.430
<v Speaker 1>didn't start the route on time.</v>

7487
03:33:47.730 --> 03:33:48.690
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of people thought,</v>

7488
03:33:48.691 --> 03:33:48.811
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

7489
03:33:48.811 --> 03:33:50.190
<v Speaker 1>the fight should have been stopped right there.</v>

7490
03:33:50.910 --> 03:33:52.620
<v Speaker 1>I was on that side of the point.</v>

7491
03:33:52.920 --> 03:33:53.580
<v Speaker 1>I was too.</v>

7492
03:33:53.580 --> 03:33:55.020
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very important,</v>

7493
03:33:55.170 --> 03:33:57.150
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're talking about someone being hurt.</v>

7494
03:33:57.340 --> 03:33:57.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

7495
03:33:57.900 --> 03:33:58.051
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

7496
03:33:58.051 --> 03:33:58.950
<v Speaker 1>If you heard a guy,</v>

7497
03:33:59.160 --> 03:34:01.290
<v Speaker 1>it's very important that that's,</v>

7498
03:34:01.620 --> 03:34:05.310
<v Speaker 1>you have to allow fire to capitalize on that and it and giving some an extended</v>

7499
03:34:05.311 --> 03:34:06.570
<v Speaker 1>round just because they're,</v>

7500
03:34:07.140 --> 03:34:09.260
<v Speaker 1>they're just sitting down there borrow food.</v>

7501
03:34:09.300 --> 03:34:10.430
<v Speaker 1>Tj Dillashaw</v>

7502
03:34:12.300 --> 03:34:13.620
<v Speaker 1>what is that thing on his neck?</v>

7503
03:34:13.900 --> 03:34:15.180
<v Speaker 1>Somebody talked to him and to learn that.</v>

7504
03:34:15.660 --> 03:34:18.510
<v Speaker 1>I think that's his idea that a dog tag,</v>

7505
03:34:18.740 --> 03:34:22.590
<v Speaker 1>the glitter refied that her dog tag is that like,</v>

7506
03:34:22.610 --> 03:34:23.443
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7507
03:34:23.760 --> 03:34:27.120
<v Speaker 1>well they get those at forever 21 they're in that glass,</v>

7508
03:34:27.600 --> 03:34:28.270
<v Speaker 1>that glass,</v>

7509
03:34:28.270 --> 03:34:29.640
<v Speaker 1>a feeling,</v>

7510
03:34:30.070 --> 03:34:31.500
<v Speaker 1>feeling TJC.</v>

7511
03:34:31.501 --> 03:34:34.350
<v Speaker 1>They can get it forever 20 now he's his way class here.</v>

7512
03:34:34.351 --> 03:34:35.840
<v Speaker 1>If way class here.</v>

7513
03:34:35.930 --> 03:34:36.440
<v Speaker 1>Praise.</v>

7514
03:34:36.440 --> 03:34:37.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm just kidding.</v>

7515
03:34:37.080 --> 03:34:38.310
<v Speaker 1>It's probably super expensive.</v>

7516
03:34:38.730 --> 03:34:39.563
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

7517
03:34:40.260 --> 03:34:41.550
<v Speaker 1>what's that stuff they put on a deed?</v>

7518
03:34:41.560 --> 03:34:42.620
<v Speaker 1>Quit African art.</v>

7519
03:34:45.490 --> 03:34:49.650
<v Speaker 1>If you a kickbox and mentioned you got your arm broken the sec around,</v>

7520
03:34:50.640 --> 03:34:53.160
<v Speaker 1>you're stopping you to tell the ref mom,</v>

7521
03:34:53.250 --> 03:34:54.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm not telling them graph.</v>

7522
03:34:54.300 --> 03:34:54.570
<v Speaker 1>If I,</v>

7523
03:34:54.570 --> 03:34:55.291
<v Speaker 1>if I'm good to go,</v>

7524
03:34:55.291 --> 03:34:56.124
<v Speaker 1>I'm going,</v>

7525
03:34:57.220 --> 03:34:58.053
<v Speaker 1>are you good to go?</v>

7526
03:34:58.580 --> 03:34:59.281
<v Speaker 1>If I mean,</v>

7527
03:34:59.281 --> 03:35:00.114
<v Speaker 1>you would know,</v>

7528
03:35:00.240 --> 03:35:00.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

7529
03:35:00.600 --> 03:35:01.920
<v Speaker 1>You will know how bad it hurts.</v>

7530
03:35:02.060 --> 03:35:02.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7531
03:35:02.190 --> 03:35:03.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean it would,</v>

7532
03:35:03.000 --> 03:35:04.110
<v Speaker 1>it would,</v>

7533
03:35:04.111 --> 03:35:06.420
<v Speaker 1>it depend entirely upon like where it's broken.</v>

7534
03:35:06.421 --> 03:35:07.740
<v Speaker 1>Like what if it was broken up here?</v>

7535
03:35:08.510 --> 03:35:10.530
<v Speaker 1>Like when Minataro fought Frank Mir.</v>

7536
03:35:10.550 --> 03:35:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7537
03:35:10.840 --> 03:35:12.210
<v Speaker 1>And snap the upper arm.</v>

7538
03:35:12.240 --> 03:35:13.073
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7539
03:35:13.200 --> 03:35:14.730
<v Speaker 1>That's a little different than the forearm,</v>

7540
03:35:14.731 --> 03:35:15.564
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

7541
03:35:16.500 --> 03:35:16.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7542
03:35:16.711 --> 03:35:18.520
<v Speaker 1>That's much different than the form then.</v>

7543
03:35:18.580 --> 03:35:20.700
<v Speaker 1>You can't even use that arm at all.</v>

7544
03:35:20.790 --> 03:35:21.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

7545
03:35:21.310 --> 03:35:22.230
<v Speaker 1>it's the forum.</v>

7546
03:35:22.231 --> 03:35:26.040
<v Speaker 1>You can at least move it out of the way and you could stand like you're gonna</v>

7547
03:35:26.070 --> 03:35:26.670
<v Speaker 1>throw it.</v>

7548
03:35:26.670 --> 03:35:27.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7549
03:35:27.420 --> 03:35:28.251
<v Speaker 1>Like if you get hurt,</v>

7550
03:35:28.251 --> 03:35:29.160
<v Speaker 1>it's like your hand.</v>

7551
03:35:29.670 --> 03:35:30.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7552
03:35:30.080 --> 03:35:30.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

7553
03:35:30.710 --> 03:35:31.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

7554
03:35:31.290 --> 03:35:32.700
<v Speaker 1>you break that upper arm,</v>

7555
03:35:33.600 --> 03:35:35.370
<v Speaker 1>that's a different beast to further up.</v>

7556
03:35:35.371 --> 03:35:35.911
<v Speaker 1>It goes.</v>

7557
03:35:35.911 --> 03:35:37.560
<v Speaker 1>The worse it gets for fighting man,</v>

7558
03:35:37.770 --> 03:35:38.610
<v Speaker 1>break your hands.</v>

7559
03:35:38.611 --> 03:35:40.980
<v Speaker 1>You can still fight and break your form.</v>

7560
03:35:41.010 --> 03:35:42.390
<v Speaker 1>You may be able to fight.</v>

7561
03:35:42.530 --> 03:35:43.120
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

7562
03:35:43.120 --> 03:35:43.390
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

7563
03:35:43.390 --> 03:35:44.550
<v Speaker 1>You chip it or crack it.</v>

7564
03:35:44.551 --> 03:35:45.150
<v Speaker 1>You may be,</v>

7565
03:35:45.150 --> 03:35:45.720
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

7566
03:35:45.720 --> 03:35:48.660
<v Speaker 1>you started getting up here and you bicep area.</v>

7567
03:35:48.690 --> 03:35:50.490
<v Speaker 1>If you've ever seen Ian Mccall's hands.</v>

7568
03:35:51.570 --> 03:35:51.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7569
03:35:51.961 --> 03:35:56.961
<v Speaker 1>He's broke his hand like a hundred times or even fucking broken here.</v>

7570
03:35:57.360 --> 03:35:59.880
<v Speaker 1>He can't make a fist and he makes a fist.</v>

7571
03:35:59.881 --> 03:36:00.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like this isn't,</v>

7572
03:36:00.950 --> 03:36:02.550
<v Speaker 1>is one knuckle is always poking out.</v>

7573
03:36:02.551 --> 03:36:03.301
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't close.</v>

7574
03:36:03.301 --> 03:36:04.050
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

7575
03:36:04.050 --> 03:36:08.280
<v Speaker 1>And he's had a bunch of operations so they're trying to figure out what had</v>

7576
03:36:08.281 --> 03:36:09.050
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

7577
03:36:09.050 --> 03:36:11.560
<v Speaker 1>So it was somehow it was blocking the kick</v>

7578
03:36:13.790 --> 03:36:14.370
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

7579
03:36:14.370 --> 03:36:15.570
<v Speaker 1>I think they isolated it.</v>

7580
03:36:16.170 --> 03:36:17.580
<v Speaker 1>Are they just showing you highlights here?</v>

7581
03:36:18.280 --> 03:36:19.740
<v Speaker 1>It looks like they're just showing highlights.</v>

7582
03:36:19.920 --> 03:36:20.610
<v Speaker 1>They have no idea.</v>

7583
03:36:20.610 --> 03:36:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7584
03:36:21.000 --> 03:36:22.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean who knows?</v>

7585
03:36:23.220 --> 03:36:25.650
<v Speaker 1>But some of Marcus' kicks fucking heart right there.</v>

7586
03:36:25.680 --> 03:36:26.251
<v Speaker 1>That's probably right.</v>

7587
03:36:26.251 --> 03:36:26.790
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

7588
03:36:26.790 --> 03:36:28.890
<v Speaker 1>that's probably it started shaking it.</v>

7589
03:36:29.850 --> 03:36:30.270
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

7590
03:36:30.270 --> 03:36:30.571
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7591
03:36:30.571 --> 03:36:31.440
<v Speaker 1>And the way he's holding it.</v>

7592
03:36:32.150 --> 03:36:32.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7593
03:36:32.940 --> 03:36:33.773
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>

7594
03:36:33.780 --> 03:36:34.560
<v Speaker 1>It was that kicked.</v>

7595
03:36:34.560 --> 03:36:35.393
<v Speaker 1>So that was it.</v>

7596
03:36:35.570 --> 03:36:36.403
<v Speaker 1>They nailed it.</v>

7597
03:36:37.060 --> 03:36:37.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

7598
03:36:37.451 --> 03:36:41.140
<v Speaker 1>You can't let a guy fight with a fucking broken arm if you know it's a broken</v>

7599
03:36:41.141 --> 03:36:41.470
<v Speaker 1>arm.</v>

7600
03:36:41.470 --> 03:36:44.170
<v Speaker 1>Like if you want to hide it even where you can hide it,</v>

7601
03:36:44.320 --> 03:36:47.620
<v Speaker 1>but they have to stop it once it gets brought to the doctor's attention.</v>

7602
03:36:47.621 --> 03:36:48.454
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7603
03:36:48.510 --> 03:36:50.100
<v Speaker 3>Sean Yarbrough broke,</v>

7604
03:36:50.170 --> 03:36:51.003
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

7605
03:36:51.330 --> 03:36:56.010
<v Speaker 3>Steven Richards for forum with a body kick and there's like one lion fight,</v>

7606
03:36:56.011 --> 03:36:58.620
<v Speaker 3>like one of the first line flight snap just for him.</v>

7607
03:36:58.680 --> 03:37:01.440
<v Speaker 3>And Steven Richards went on and beat him to the,</v>

7608
03:37:01.470 --> 03:37:03.480
<v Speaker 3>for the decision and the final clip,</v>

7609
03:37:03.540 --> 03:37:05.610
<v Speaker 3>he was just kept clinching him up and like dumping him and shit.</v>

7610
03:37:05.611 --> 03:37:08.410
<v Speaker 3>But he broke his arm and you could see like in there holding it after the fight</v>

7611
03:37:08.411 --> 03:37:09.810
<v Speaker 3>and you could see like a huge debt.</v>

7612
03:37:10.320 --> 03:37:11.220
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

7613
03:37:11.990 --> 03:37:12.480
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

7614
03:37:12.480 --> 03:37:15.150
<v Speaker 3>it's like Jamie Varner and he broke his ankle.</v>

7615
03:37:15.480 --> 03:37:16.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

7616
03:37:16.660 --> 03:37:17.350
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

7617
03:37:17.350 --> 03:37:19.750
<v Speaker 1>that should have been stuff that should have been stopped.</v>

7618
03:37:20.100 --> 03:37:21.220
<v Speaker 1>And that was obvious.</v>

7619
03:37:21.221 --> 03:37:22.510
<v Speaker 1>He can't do anything about that.</v>

7620
03:37:22.511 --> 03:37:22.871
<v Speaker 1>But if he,</v>

7621
03:37:22.871 --> 03:37:24.250
<v Speaker 1>if that would have been his forearm,</v>

7622
03:37:24.280 --> 03:37:25.300
<v Speaker 1>he would've continued it.</v>

7623
03:37:25.780 --> 03:37:26.613
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

7624
03:37:26.860 --> 03:37:28.210
<v Speaker 1>he went back to his corner.</v>

7625
03:37:28.211 --> 03:37:28.540
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

7626
03:37:28.540 --> 03:37:31.840
<v Speaker 1>Did that happen in the first round quarterback back to his corner.</v>

7627
03:37:31.841 --> 03:37:32.860
<v Speaker 1>And that's when they called it.</v>

7628
03:37:33.460 --> 03:37:35.800
<v Speaker 1>But that happened midway through the first,</v>

7629
03:37:35.830 --> 03:37:36.930
<v Speaker 1>they didn't make a second.</v>

7630
03:37:36.970 --> 03:37:38.050
<v Speaker 1>He got knocked out.</v>

7631
03:37:39.010 --> 03:37:39.880
<v Speaker 1>He got knocked out,</v>

7632
03:37:41.050 --> 03:37:41.400
<v Speaker 1>plates.</v>

7633
03:37:41.400 --> 03:37:42.400
<v Speaker 1>Tweet came back out.</v>

7634
03:37:43.300 --> 03:37:44.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure he came back out.</v>

7635
03:37:45.900 --> 03:37:50.350
<v Speaker 1>What he did get knocked out and I think it was a,</v>

7636
03:37:52.450 --> 03:37:53.410
<v Speaker 1>was it true Hilo?</v>

7637
03:37:54.010 --> 03:37:54.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

7638
03:37:54.490 --> 03:37:55.330
<v Speaker 1>able to Hilo.</v>

7639
03:37:56.480 --> 03:37:57.140
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

7640
03:37:57.140 --> 03:37:57.670
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

7641
03:37:57.670 --> 03:37:58.410
<v Speaker 1>Who is that?</v>

7642
03:37:58.410 --> 03:38:00.530
<v Speaker 1>What does it go back up so I can see who he's fighting?</v>

7643
03:38:00.680 --> 03:38:01.513
<v Speaker 1>Who is that?</v>

7644
03:38:03.800 --> 03:38:04.633
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

7645
03:38:08.160 --> 03:38:08.993
<v Speaker 1>Is that it?</v>

7646
03:38:09.780 --> 03:38:10.770
<v Speaker 1>Broken Ankle?</v>

7647
03:38:11.520 --> 03:38:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

7648
03:38:12.090 --> 03:38:12.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't think this is</v>

7649
03:38:14.930 --> 03:38:15.920
<v Speaker 1>what I'm thinking of.</v>

7650
03:38:16.710 --> 03:38:18.080
<v Speaker 1>He break his ankle more than once.</v>

7651
03:38:18.830 --> 03:38:22.130
<v Speaker 1>What was the fight where he was in a crazy slug fest with somebody?</v>

7652
03:38:22.160 --> 03:38:22.371
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

7653
03:38:22.371 --> 03:38:22.551
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

7654
03:38:22.551 --> 03:38:24.170
<v Speaker 1>that was Afro Reebok deal.</v>

7655
03:38:24.230 --> 03:38:25.400
<v Speaker 1>That was James Kraus.</v>

7656
03:38:25.430 --> 03:38:26.450
<v Speaker 1>That's who it is right there.</v>

7657
03:38:26.630 --> 03:38:27.463
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7658
03:38:27.590 --> 03:38:27.741
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

7659
03:38:27.741 --> 03:38:28.574
<v Speaker 1>I remember this.</v>

7660
03:38:29.690 --> 03:38:30.111
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

7661
03:38:30.111 --> 03:38:30.944
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

7662
03:38:32.960 --> 03:38:34.220
<v Speaker 1>It just gave out on him.</v>

7663
03:38:34.490 --> 03:38:35.151
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

7664
03:38:35.151 --> 03:38:35.721
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

7665
03:38:35.721 --> 03:38:36.261
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

7666
03:38:36.261 --> 03:38:37.100
<v Speaker 1>Now I remember.</v>

7667
03:38:37.250 --> 03:38:39.170
<v Speaker 1>So I think I confused that.</v>

7668
03:38:39.171 --> 03:38:40.910
<v Speaker 1>And his fight with able to Hilo,</v>

7669
03:38:41.120 --> 03:38:44.900
<v Speaker 1>his fight with able true Hilo was a slobber knocker and true Hilo wind up</v>

7670
03:38:44.901 --> 03:38:45.860
<v Speaker 1>winning by knockout.</v>

7671
03:38:46.190 --> 03:38:47.210
<v Speaker 1>That's what that was.</v>

7672
03:38:47.540 --> 03:38:48.830
<v Speaker 1>I can fabulous.</v>

7673
03:38:48.840 --> 03:38:52.850
<v Speaker 1>Did the two of them and he went down the same way that he went down right there.</v>

7674
03:38:52.910 --> 03:38:53.590
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

7675
03:38:53.590 --> 03:38:53.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7676
03:38:53.960 --> 03:38:55.430
<v Speaker 1>When he got hit with that hook,</v>

7677
03:38:55.850 --> 03:38:57.740
<v Speaker 1>he was making that same move.</v>

7678
03:38:58.790 --> 03:39:01.150
<v Speaker 1>So it looks like weird.</v>

7679
03:39:01.220 --> 03:39:03.620
<v Speaker 1>I had the two memories confused in my mind.</v>

7680
03:39:06.890 --> 03:39:11.120
<v Speaker 1>Powerful glory from Denver.</v>

7681
03:39:12.140 --> 03:39:12.501
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

7682
03:39:12.501 --> 03:39:13.940
<v Speaker 1>Here's able to Hylo in him.</v>

7683
03:39:14.070 --> 03:39:14.903
<v Speaker 10>Boom,</v>

7684
03:39:17.530 --> 03:39:17.831
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

7685
03:39:17.831 --> 03:39:18.350
<v Speaker 1>Right there.</v>

7686
03:39:18.350 --> 03:39:18.970
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

7687
03:39:18.970 --> 03:39:19.541
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

7688
03:39:19.541 --> 03:39:20.210
<v Speaker 1>The same.</v>

7689
03:39:20.210 --> 03:39:20.460

03:39:20.721 --> 03:39:21.850
<v Speaker 1>you were fucking right.</v>

7692
03:39:21.880 --> 03:39:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Eve Edwards.</v>

7693
03:39:23.290 --> 03:39:24.071
<v Speaker 1>He figured it out,</v>

7694
03:39:24.071 --> 03:39:24.904
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

7695
03:39:25.030 --> 03:39:25.450
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

7696
03:39:25.450 --> 03:39:26.140

03:39:30.190 --> 03:39:31.023
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

7700
03:39:32.690 --> 03:39:33.523
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

7701
03:39:33.550 --> 03:39:34.070
<v Speaker 1>if I was</v>

7702
03:39:34.070 --> 03:39:36.500
<v Speaker 13>in my prime right now and I was in the UFC,</v>

7703
03:39:36.501 --> 03:39:37.760
<v Speaker 13>I would have to be a 45.</v>

7704
03:39:37.761 --> 03:39:40.970
<v Speaker 13>These dudes are so much bigger than we were 10 years ago.</v>

7705
03:39:41.330 --> 03:39:42.440
<v Speaker 13>How do you feel about that?</v>

7706
03:39:42.530 --> 03:39:42.830
<v Speaker 13>What do you,</v>

7707
03:39:42.830 --> 03:39:44.390
<v Speaker 13>what's your feelings about weight cutting?</v>

7708
03:39:45.080 --> 03:39:45.913
<v Speaker 13>My interview on you.</v>

7709
03:39:49.220 --> 03:39:50.120
<v Speaker 13>I'm not a journalist.</v>

7710
03:39:51.020 --> 03:39:51.441
<v Speaker 13>Do you,</v>

7711
03:39:51.441 --> 03:39:52.460
<v Speaker 13>do you approve it?</v>

7712
03:39:53.270 --> 03:39:56.210
<v Speaker 13>Do you think that we'd all be better off if everybody abandoned it?</v>

7713
03:39:56.630 --> 03:39:58.970
<v Speaker 13>Do you think that it's a smart thing?</v>

7714
03:39:59.770 --> 03:40:01.040
<v Speaker 13>I'm asking too many questions.</v>

7715
03:40:01.130 --> 03:40:01.580
<v Speaker 13>No,</v>

7716
03:40:01.580 --> 03:40:03.110
<v Speaker 13>I don't disapprove of it,</v>

7717
03:40:03.111 --> 03:40:06.950
<v Speaker 13>but I think we would all be better off in the long run as the fighters would be</v>

7718
03:40:06.951 --> 03:40:08.360
<v Speaker 13>lot better off in the long run,</v>

7719
03:40:08.420 --> 03:40:09.440
<v Speaker 13>but not having to do it.</v>

7720
03:40:09.441 --> 03:40:10.310
<v Speaker 13>There are some guys,</v>

7721
03:40:10.640 --> 03:40:11.061
<v Speaker 13>for me,</v>

7722
03:40:11.061 --> 03:40:12.200
<v Speaker 13>it wasn't miserable.</v>

7723
03:40:12.640 --> 03:40:13.400
<v Speaker 13>Um,</v>

7724
03:40:13.400 --> 03:40:15.500
<v Speaker 13>but there are some guys that it is,</v>

7725
03:40:15.501 --> 03:40:15.721
<v Speaker 13>and,</v>

7726
03:40:15.721 --> 03:40:16.371
<v Speaker 13>and even for me,</v>

7727
03:40:16.371 --> 03:40:20.960
<v Speaker 13>I think I'm still taking some burning that oil at both ends.</v>

7728
03:40:21.050 --> 03:40:21.311
<v Speaker 13>Um,</v>

7729
03:40:21.311 --> 03:40:23.180
<v Speaker 13>so I burn the candle at both ends at that point.</v>

7730
03:40:23.570 --> 03:40:24.290
<v Speaker 13>Um,</v>

7731
03:40:24.290 --> 03:40:29.200
<v Speaker 13>but it's not as hard as say some guys like leasing t bow or um,</v>

7732
03:40:29.270 --> 03:40:29.811
<v Speaker 13>guys that,</v>

7733
03:40:29.811 --> 03:40:31.580
<v Speaker 13>that are much bigger and the weight class,</v>

7734
03:40:31.581 --> 03:40:31.940
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

7735
03:40:31.940 --> 03:40:32.620
<v Speaker 13>I think,</v>

7736
03:40:32.620 --> 03:40:32.840
<v Speaker 13>uh,</v>

7737
03:40:32.840 --> 03:40:35.960
<v Speaker 13>in the long run you are putting a toll on your body that's going to,</v>

7738
03:40:35.961 --> 03:40:37.400
<v Speaker 13>you're going to have to pay the price.</v>

7739
03:40:37.460 --> 03:40:39.230
<v Speaker 13>You're going to have to pay that tax at some point,</v>

7740
03:40:39.830 --> 03:40:40.310
<v Speaker 13>but,</v>

7741
03:40:40.310 --> 03:40:44.090
<v Speaker 13>and that could come when you're 50 or you know,</v>

7742
03:40:44.420 --> 03:40:44.960
<v Speaker 13>I don't know,</v>

7743
03:40:44.960 --> 03:40:45.590
<v Speaker 13>whatever.</v>

7744
03:40:45.590 --> 03:40:45.801
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

7745
03:40:45.801 --> 03:40:50.801
<v Speaker 13>It seems that fighting itself is such an incredibly difficult task on your body.</v>

7746
03:40:51.140 --> 03:40:56.140
<v Speaker 13>Why would you want to put it through the task of massive dehydration 24 hours</v>

7747
03:40:56.271 --> 03:40:56.991
<v Speaker 13>before finding,</v>

7748
03:40:56.991 --> 03:40:58.160
<v Speaker 13>it just doesn't make any sense.</v>

7749
03:40:58.730 --> 03:41:01.520
<v Speaker 13>I know that everybody does it to gain a competitive advantage,</v>

7750
03:41:01.550 --> 03:41:03.890
<v Speaker 13>but wouldn't it be better if it was just all,</v>

7751
03:41:03.891 --> 03:41:05.320
<v Speaker 13>even even wait,</v>

7752
03:41:05.330 --> 03:41:06.200
<v Speaker 13>like honest,</v>

7753
03:41:06.590 --> 03:41:08.810
<v Speaker 13>like fuck this competitive advantage shit.</v>

7754
03:41:09.020 --> 03:41:09.853
<v Speaker 13>If everybody just,</v>

7755
03:41:10.040 --> 03:41:10.551
<v Speaker 13>first of all,</v>

7756
03:41:10.551 --> 03:41:11.600
<v Speaker 13>there should be more options,</v>

7757
03:41:11.630 --> 03:41:12.020
<v Speaker 13>right?</v>

7758
03:41:12.020 --> 03:41:12.831
<v Speaker 13>I think we all agree on,</v>

7759
03:41:12.831 --> 03:41:16.730
<v Speaker 13>I think that's how you solved the problem and have a one 70 than a one 85 and a</v>

7760
03:41:16.731 --> 03:41:19.690
<v Speaker 13>two oh five and a to 65 and expect people to not wait.</v>

7761
03:41:19.700 --> 03:41:22.040
<v Speaker 13>They're gonna fuck a cut weight 100% right either your,</v>

7762
03:41:22.041 --> 03:41:23.840
<v Speaker 13>your options are fight gorillas.</v>

7763
03:41:24.100 --> 03:41:29.100
<v Speaker 13>I had a to 65 or you way to 30 you know we gotta deal with fucking chain car</v>

7764
03:41:29.511 --> 03:41:32.500
<v Speaker 13>went on top of you or something like that and you're a two 30 pounder.</v>

7765
03:41:32.510 --> 03:41:33.021
<v Speaker 13>Fuck that.</v>

7766
03:41:33.021 --> 03:41:36.350
<v Speaker 13>You got to make that two oh five and you're going to suck it up cause there</v>

7767
03:41:36.351 --> 03:41:38.420
<v Speaker 13>should be a way class every 10 pounds.</v>

7768
03:41:38.990 --> 03:41:41.480
<v Speaker 13>And I think with fighters like what really matters,</v>

7769
03:41:41.481 --> 03:41:45.380
<v Speaker 13>what everybody cares about is who the best guys fight.</v>

7770
03:41:45.381 --> 03:41:47.090
<v Speaker 13>Like the best guys fighting the best guys.</v>

7771
03:41:47.390 --> 03:41:47.601
<v Speaker 13>You know,</v>

7772
03:41:47.601 --> 03:41:51.050
<v Speaker 13>whether Norma Grumet off and a Conor McGregor had a belt or not,</v>

7773
03:41:51.051 --> 03:41:51.650
<v Speaker 13>right?</v>

7774
03:41:51.650 --> 03:41:55.370
<v Speaker 13>If number Grumman off didn't have the 155 pound belt and Conor McGregor didn't</v>

7775
03:41:55.371 --> 03:41:56.690
<v Speaker 13>have the 155 pound belt,</v>

7776
03:41:56.840 --> 03:42:00.740
<v Speaker 13>it would be worth more to watch those two go at it.</v>

7777
03:42:00.800 --> 03:42:02.120
<v Speaker 13>At 155 pounds,</v>

7778
03:42:02.330 --> 03:42:07.330
<v Speaker 13>then it would for me to watch maybe Eddie Alvarez defended against somebody</v>

7779
03:42:07.731 --> 03:42:08.564
<v Speaker 13>else.</v>

7780
03:42:08.660 --> 03:42:12.620
<v Speaker 13>You know like I just want to see like if it was not Connor or not some high</v>

7781
03:42:12.621 --> 03:42:13.370
<v Speaker 13>level guy,</v>

7782
03:42:13.370 --> 03:42:16.070
<v Speaker 13>I'd be more interested in seeing the high level guys who don't have the belt.</v>

7783
03:42:17.390 --> 03:42:21.770
<v Speaker 13>But if you were to make more weight classes then you get super fights.</v>

7784
03:42:21.771 --> 03:42:22.580
<v Speaker 13>Yes.</v>

7785
03:42:22.580 --> 03:42:23.360
<v Speaker 13>It's all good,</v>

7786
03:42:23.360 --> 03:42:23.780
<v Speaker 13>right?</v>

7787
03:42:23.780 --> 03:42:24.320
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

7788
03:42:24.320 --> 03:42:24.640
<v Speaker 13>You,</v>

7789
03:42:24.640 --> 03:42:26.150
<v Speaker 13>you get the hundred and 60 pounds,</v>

7790
03:42:26.151 --> 03:42:30.410
<v Speaker 13>you have anniversary to 150 pound champion and it's like this is a fight that</v>

7791
03:42:30.411 --> 03:42:33.120
<v Speaker 13>people want to see because it's not that much of a difference.</v>

7792
03:42:33.810 --> 03:42:34.111
<v Speaker 13>You know,</v>

7793
03:42:34.111 --> 03:42:37.560
<v Speaker 13>they gave people a little bit of a break by letting fighters way in early.</v>

7794
03:42:37.560 --> 03:42:40.530
<v Speaker 13>Now you could weigh in between like eight and 10:00 AM and that way,</v>

7795
03:42:40.531 --> 03:42:44.910
<v Speaker 13>by the time the way in ceremony goes on at like 4:00 PM you're fully hydrated.</v>

7796
03:42:44.911 --> 03:42:45.744
<v Speaker 13>You look good.</v>

7797
03:42:45.840 --> 03:42:47.220
<v Speaker 13>You don't look like death anymore.</v>

7798
03:42:47.460 --> 03:42:47.941
<v Speaker 13>Like Conor,</v>

7799
03:42:47.941 --> 03:42:51.540
<v Speaker 13>when he fought Chad Mendez every that last time you made 45 you're like,</v>

7800
03:42:51.541 --> 03:42:52.830
<v Speaker 13>what the fuck?</v>

7801
03:42:53.220 --> 03:42:53.940
<v Speaker 13>Like he looks,</v>

7802
03:42:53.940 --> 03:42:56.340
<v Speaker 13>he looks like like a dying person.</v>

7803
03:42:56.940 --> 03:43:00.420
<v Speaker 13>And then he's gonna fight for a world title 24 hours from now.</v>

7804
03:43:00.421 --> 03:43:02.130
<v Speaker 13>That's a ridiculous practice.</v>

7805
03:43:02.250 --> 03:43:03.440
<v Speaker 13>It's ridiculous that,</v>

7806
03:43:03.540 --> 03:43:03.770
<v Speaker 13>that,</v>

7807
03:43:03.770 --> 03:43:04.120
<v Speaker 13>that,</v>

7808
03:43:04.120 --> 03:43:04.951
<v Speaker 13>that was my thing.</v>

7809
03:43:04.951 --> 03:43:05.401
<v Speaker 13>I'm not,</v>

7810
03:43:05.401 --> 03:43:06.870
<v Speaker 13>I'm not huge fill a class,</v>

7811
03:43:06.871 --> 03:43:11.871
<v Speaker 13>but I was decent sized for the weight class so I could get down to like one 53</v>

7812
03:43:12.540 --> 03:43:13.590
<v Speaker 13>the day of the weigh in.</v>

7813
03:43:13.591 --> 03:43:17.520
<v Speaker 13>So I would cut to about one 53 and then get put,</v>

7814
03:43:17.550 --> 03:43:20.370
<v Speaker 13>put about two and a half pounds of food in my body,</v>

7815
03:43:21.000 --> 03:43:21.833
<v Speaker 13>food and water.</v>

7816
03:43:22.020 --> 03:43:23.370
<v Speaker 13>And that's why it weigh ins.</v>

7817
03:43:23.400 --> 03:43:24.233
<v Speaker 13>I was happy.</v>

7818
03:43:24.660 --> 03:43:25.740
<v Speaker 13>I was never measurable.</v>

7819
03:43:26.070 --> 03:43:27.120
<v Speaker 13>It was never sucking it up.</v>

7820
03:43:27.121 --> 03:43:31.380
<v Speaker 13>I mean sometimes you overcut and then bounce it up.</v>

7821
03:43:31.470 --> 03:43:32.210
<v Speaker 13>Hey,</v>

7822
03:43:32.210 --> 03:43:33.180
<v Speaker 13>interesting.</v>

7823
03:43:33.900 --> 03:43:34.360
<v Speaker 13>But I,</v>

7824
03:43:34.360 --> 03:43:35.790
<v Speaker 13>I was small enough to do that.</v>

7825
03:43:36.260 --> 03:43:37.270
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

7826
03:43:37.350 --> 03:43:38.850
<v Speaker 13>Usually those last three pounds,</v>

7827
03:43:38.851 --> 03:43:39.420
<v Speaker 13>they're like,</v>

7828
03:43:39.420 --> 03:43:40.120
<v Speaker 13>yeah,</v>

7829
03:43:40.120 --> 03:43:40.830
<v Speaker 13>I would wake up,</v>

7830
03:43:40.830 --> 03:43:41.640
<v Speaker 13>fight morning.</v>

7831
03:43:41.640 --> 03:43:41.791
<v Speaker 13>Um,</v>

7832
03:43:41.791 --> 03:43:46.050
<v Speaker 13>so I weigh in morning at like 158 maybe if I'm heavy,</v>

7833
03:43:46.051 --> 03:43:49.350
<v Speaker 13>I'm 158 most of the time to look up at 56 57.</v>

7834
03:43:50.520 --> 03:43:51.210
<v Speaker 13>Well,</v>

7835
03:43:51.210 --> 03:43:56.210
<v Speaker 13>I mean I think you were lucky in the sense that you were in that your body fit</v>

7836
03:43:56.521 --> 03:43:58.230
<v Speaker 13>right in there with that weight class.</v>

7837
03:43:58.231 --> 03:44:00.720
<v Speaker 13>If you were a little bit bigger maybe would be an issue.</v>

7838
03:44:00.930 --> 03:44:04.080
<v Speaker 13>Like maybe what if you were a little bit bigger but not quite big enough for one</v>

7839
03:44:04.081 --> 03:44:06.030
<v Speaker 13>70 you know?</v>

7840
03:44:06.270 --> 03:44:06.690
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

7841
03:44:06.690 --> 03:44:08.070
<v Speaker 13>Like a Diego Sanchez.</v>

7842
03:44:08.460 --> 03:44:10.290
<v Speaker 13>Diego was kind of a tweener right.</v>

7843
03:44:10.620 --> 03:44:13.830
<v Speaker 13>He was a guy that really struggled to make 55 I remember the first time I saw</v>

7844
03:44:13.831 --> 03:44:18.180
<v Speaker 13>him when he made 55 I'm pretty sure it was in England and I remember going Jesus</v>

7845
03:44:18.181 --> 03:44:21.300
<v Speaker 13>like he looks so drawn out at the way in.</v>

7846
03:44:21.301 --> 03:44:25.710
<v Speaker 13>He looked terrible and then he got it balanced out if figured out how to do it.</v>

7847
03:44:25.711 --> 03:44:29.610
<v Speaker 13>But I don't think ideally his weight would be 55 I think is ideal.</v>

7848
03:44:29.611 --> 03:44:32.450
<v Speaker 13>We would probably be like 65 or 60 you know,</v>

7849
03:44:32.480 --> 03:44:33.360
<v Speaker 13>somewhere in that range.</v>

7850
03:44:33.361 --> 03:44:38.361
<v Speaker 13>I think if they went 51 51 60 or (556) 057-0580 five I mean they could do it</v>

7851
03:44:39.571 --> 03:44:40.410
<v Speaker 13>that way easily.</v>

7852
03:44:40.980 --> 03:44:44.100
<v Speaker 13>But 10 pounds I think is like the right,</v>

7853
03:44:44.550 --> 03:44:45.383
<v Speaker 13>the right number.</v>

7854
03:44:45.420 --> 03:44:48.850
<v Speaker 13>So you think the four or five pounds of boxing is too,</v>

7855
03:44:48.870 --> 03:44:50.700
<v Speaker 13>too small of a weight.</v>

7856
03:44:51.090 --> 03:44:54.150
<v Speaker 13>It's interesting cause I think it's more of a factor in MMA than it is in boxing</v>

7857
03:44:54.930 --> 03:44:55.490
<v Speaker 13>and wait.</v>

7858
03:44:55.490 --> 03:44:56.160
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

7859
03:44:56.160 --> 03:44:57.830
<v Speaker 13>And boxing has more options.</v>

7860
03:44:58.110 --> 03:45:01.520
<v Speaker 13>It was just kind of kind of interesting in a way.</v>

7861
03:45:02.040 --> 03:45:04.770
<v Speaker 13>But obviously boxing is just got way more history,</v>

7862
03:45:05.230 --> 03:45:05.641
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

7863
03:45:05.641 --> 03:45:09.240
<v Speaker 13>it's been around way longer and people were smaller back then too.</v>

7864
03:45:09.570 --> 03:45:13.110
<v Speaker 13>So it's not like you can eliminate Slapsie Maxie what it was he,</v>

7865
03:45:13.111 --> 03:45:14.100
<v Speaker 13>is he at light heavyweight?</v>

7866
03:45:14.101 --> 03:45:14.934
<v Speaker 13>No,</v>

7867
03:45:15.210 --> 03:45:17.130
<v Speaker 13>it was Billy conn was a light heavyweight.</v>

7868
03:45:17.131 --> 03:45:17.670
<v Speaker 13>Right.</v>

7869
03:45:17.670 --> 03:45:19.400
<v Speaker 13>And I forget what you,</v>

7870
03:45:19.410 --> 03:45:20.310
<v Speaker 13>when they changed it,</v>

7871
03:45:20.311 --> 03:45:24.720
<v Speaker 13>but I mean heavyweight was 154 pounds and up way back in the day.</v>

7872
03:45:24.870 --> 03:45:25.290
<v Speaker 13>Really?</v>

7873
03:45:25.290 --> 03:45:25.651
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

7874
03:45:25.651 --> 03:45:29.630
<v Speaker 13>154 pounds more than one 50 volt with heavyweight like in,</v>

7875
03:45:29.631 --> 03:45:30.670
<v Speaker 13>in the early,</v>

7876
03:45:31.810 --> 03:45:34.420
<v Speaker 11>like probably like twenties and thirties whoa.</v>

7877
03:45:34.480 --> 03:45:35.313
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

7878
03:45:35.520 --> 03:45:36.220
<v Speaker 11>Well I saw,</v>

7879
03:45:36.220 --> 03:45:37.120
<v Speaker 11>even in California,</v>

7880
03:45:37.121 --> 03:45:39.700
<v Speaker 11>I think it's over 71 75 or something like that.</v>

7881
03:45:39.880 --> 03:45:40.713
<v Speaker 11>It's supposed to be.</v>

7882
03:45:40.720 --> 03:45:43.910
<v Speaker 11>Trying to think of like classic and technically boxes.</v>

7883
03:45:43.920 --> 03:45:45.400
<v Speaker 11>A heavyweight over one,</v>

7884
03:45:45.460 --> 03:45:46.660
<v Speaker 11>one 76 I think.</v>

7885
03:45:46.810 --> 03:45:47.560
<v Speaker 11>Wow.</v>

7886
03:45:47.560 --> 03:45:48.580
<v Speaker 11>That's crazy.</v>

7887
03:45:49.750 --> 03:45:53.140
<v Speaker 11>Remember when your Roy Jones Jr went up to heavyweight and beat John Ruiz?</v>

7888
03:45:54.010 --> 03:45:55.150
<v Speaker 11>Holy Shit.</v>

7889
03:45:55.530 --> 03:45:56.363
<v Speaker 11>I remember that.</v>

7890
03:45:56.380 --> 03:45:56.651
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

7891
03:45:56.651 --> 03:45:57.760
<v Speaker 11>You know he's still fighting.</v>

7892
03:45:57.900 --> 03:45:58.760
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

7893
03:45:59.140 --> 03:45:59.973
<v Speaker 11>It makes me sad.</v>

7894
03:46:00.030 --> 03:46:00.863
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

7895
03:46:01.090 --> 03:46:02.260
<v Speaker 11>I love that dude.</v>

7896
03:46:02.730 --> 03:46:04.210
<v Speaker 11>When I was a kid he was like,</v>

7897
03:46:04.570 --> 03:46:05.470
<v Speaker 11>he was superman.</v>

7898
03:46:06.100 --> 03:46:08.500
<v Speaker 11>Roy Jones Jr would fight rounds without getting hit.</v>

7899
03:46:09.100 --> 03:46:10.450
<v Speaker 11>Like nobody ever did that before.</v>

7900
03:46:11.770 --> 03:46:12.190
<v Speaker 11>He was,</v>

7901
03:46:12.190 --> 03:46:13.780
<v Speaker 11>he was so good.</v>

7902
03:46:13.890 --> 03:46:14.920
<v Speaker 11>You haven't heard of Willie pep?</v>

7903
03:46:15.160 --> 03:46:15.521
<v Speaker 11>Yes,</v>

7904
03:46:15.521 --> 03:46:16.270
<v Speaker 11>of course.</v>

7905
03:46:16.270 --> 03:46:16.470
<v Speaker 11>Oh,</v>

7906
03:46:16.470 --> 03:46:17.303
<v Speaker 11>you heard about?</v>

7907
03:46:17.460 --> 03:46:17.810
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

7908
03:46:17.810 --> 03:46:19.600
<v Speaker 11>He went around without actually throwing a punch.</v>

7909
03:46:19.750 --> 03:46:20.170
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

7910
03:46:20.170 --> 03:46:21.003
<v Speaker 11>That's awesome.</v>

7911
03:46:21.670 --> 03:46:23.230
<v Speaker 11>In the history of copy box.</v>

7912
03:46:23.400 --> 03:46:23.940
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

7913
03:46:23.940 --> 03:46:27.070
<v Speaker 11>He said he was going to do it and then he went and did it like he said it</v>

7914
03:46:27.071 --> 03:46:27.790
<v Speaker 11>between rounds.</v>

7915
03:46:27.790 --> 03:46:28.623
<v Speaker 11>Then he went and did it.</v>

7916
03:46:29.170 --> 03:46:33.130
<v Speaker 11>You just couldn't imagine anybody at that time in particular having better</v>

7917
03:46:33.131 --> 03:46:33.970
<v Speaker 11>footwork.</v>

7918
03:46:34.810 --> 03:46:36.070
<v Speaker 11>It's an amazing,</v>

7919
03:46:36.071 --> 03:46:41.050
<v Speaker 11>like we're boxing went because if you watch some of the old Jack Johnson stuff,</v>

7920
03:46:41.290 --> 03:46:44.230
<v Speaker 11>you know and you watch like how how they used to,</v>

7921
03:46:44.500 --> 03:46:46.090
<v Speaker 11>they used to hold their hands differently,</v>

7922
03:46:46.210 --> 03:46:47.800
<v Speaker 11>they threw punches differently,</v>

7923
03:46:47.980 --> 03:46:48.610
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

7924
03:46:48.610 --> 03:46:50.230
<v Speaker 11>and then you see some Jack Dempsey like,</v>

7925
03:46:50.260 --> 03:46:50.531
<v Speaker 11>oh,</v>

7926
03:46:50.531 --> 03:46:50.711
<v Speaker 11>okay,</v>

7927
03:46:50.711 --> 03:46:53.920
<v Speaker 11>well this is starting to become a little bit more like modern boxing.</v>

7928
03:46:54.310 --> 03:46:58.930
<v Speaker 11>This is like some savage fucking railroad Hobo Dude.</v>

7929
03:47:00.730 --> 03:47:01.690
<v Speaker 11>Fuck people up.</v>

7930
03:47:02.110 --> 03:47:02.920
<v Speaker 11>You know?</v>

7931
03:47:02.920 --> 03:47:03.191
<v Speaker 11>Let me,</v>

7932
03:47:03.191 --> 03:47:04.090
<v Speaker 11>Jack Dempsey was,</v>

7933
03:47:04.091 --> 03:47:08.040
<v Speaker 11>he was scary cat when you said some savage Hobo Dude,</v>

7934
03:47:08.041 --> 03:47:10.290
<v Speaker 11>it doesn't fuck people up by first.</v>

7935
03:47:10.540 --> 03:47:14.050
<v Speaker 11>My first thing in my brain that hit me with crazy horse</v>

7936
03:47:16.420 --> 03:47:20.650
<v Speaker 11>crazy horse would be that dude at the seven 11 that's outside that you think</v>

7937
03:47:20.651 --> 03:47:23.590
<v Speaker 11>he's on something but he will fuck you up.</v>

7938
03:47:23.710 --> 03:47:28.120
<v Speaker 11>He will fuck you up quick to crazy horse can crack a lack.</v>

7939
03:47:28.150 --> 03:47:29.740
<v Speaker 11>Did you see the fight?</v>

7940
03:47:29.741 --> 03:47:33.820
<v Speaker 11>He just had it I think is horizon one punch now.</v>

7941
03:47:33.821 --> 03:47:35.950
<v Speaker 11>He was a beast and still is.</v>

7942
03:47:36.400 --> 03:47:37.270
<v Speaker 11>He's a fun dude.</v>

7943
03:47:37.271 --> 03:47:38.200
<v Speaker 11>I hung out with him one night.</v>

7944
03:47:38.201 --> 03:47:39.370
<v Speaker 11>We'd watch k one together.</v>

7945

7964
03:48:15.090 --> 03:48:15.300
<v Speaker 11>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 11>This was that fight.</v>

7967

<v Speaker 11>He got it and then it went crazy.</v>

7969
03:48:21.670 --> 03:48:22.503
<v Speaker 11>The Vandelay.</v>

7975
03:48:32.930 --> 03:48:33.141
<v Speaker 11>Well,</v>

7976
03:48:33.141 --> 03:48:36.110
<v Speaker 11>he apparently had had a street fight with Vandelay</v>

7977
03:48:39.880 --> 03:48:40.713
<v Speaker 11>pride.</v>

7978
03:48:41.140 --> 03:48:41.890
<v Speaker 11>Marcel,</v>

7979
03:48:41.890 --> 03:48:42.460
<v Speaker 11>who was it?</v>

7980
03:48:42.460 --> 03:48:43.221
<v Speaker 11>It put him to sleep.</v>

7981
03:48:43.221 --> 03:48:46.490
<v Speaker 11>Cristiana Marcello put them asleep and a triangle and a street fight.</v>

7982
03:48:47.030 --> 03:48:51.830
<v Speaker 11>And apparently he woke up and then went over the Vandelay and knocked out cold.</v>

7983
03:48:53.270 --> 03:48:54.800
<v Speaker 11>I don't tell him what the fuck happened.</v>

7984
03:48:55.250 --> 03:48:55.821
<v Speaker 11>But uh,</v>

7985
03:48:55.821 --> 03:48:57.870
<v Speaker 11>and then they jumped him and beat him up and,</v>

7986
03:48:57.950 --> 03:49:02.630
<v Speaker 11>and Vandelay went out after he got knocked out cold and then went out and</v>

7987
03:49:02.631 --> 03:49:03.464
<v Speaker 11>fought.</v>

7988
03:49:04.850 --> 03:49:06.920
<v Speaker 11>So he fought in pride and layer.</v>

7989
03:49:07.190 --> 03:49:08.540
<v Speaker 11>The horse went out and fought that night.</v>

7990
03:49:08.570 --> 03:49:09.440
<v Speaker 11>No defaults.</v>

7991
03:49:09.710 --> 03:49:11.330
<v Speaker 11>I think they both fought that night.</v>

7992
03:49:11.331 --> 03:49:11.600
<v Speaker 11>I don't,</v>

7993
03:49:11.600 --> 03:49:15.350
<v Speaker 11>I don't remember where the crazy hos fought after he knocked out Vandelay but</v>

7994
03:49:15.351 --> 03:49:19.940
<v Speaker 11>I'm almost positive that Vandelay fought after getting code lease.</v>

7995
03:49:19.990 --> 03:49:22.070
<v Speaker 11>That was depending on who you're asking.</v>

7996
03:49:22.090 --> 03:49:22.520
<v Speaker 11>Right.</v>

7997
03:49:22.520 --> 03:49:25.190
<v Speaker 11>The problem with those pride stories is I definitely wasn't there,</v>

7998
03:49:25.310 --> 03:49:30.310
<v Speaker 11>but it's pretty much agreed upon that crazy horse in some way.</v>

7999
03:49:30.500 --> 03:49:33.500
<v Speaker 11>Punched Vandelay Silva in the face and it was not a good thing.</v>

8000
03:49:34.160 --> 03:49:38.580
<v Speaker 11>And it's pretty much been proven that Cristiana Marcello choke crazy horse out</v>

8001
03:49:38.581 --> 03:49:39.190
<v Speaker 11>in a triangle.</v>

8002
03:49:39.190 --> 03:49:39.800
<v Speaker 11>Got Them and triangle,</v>

8003
03:49:39.800 --> 03:49:40.633
<v Speaker 11>I've seen the video,</v>

8004
03:49:40.700 --> 03:49:41.930
<v Speaker 11>he puts them to sleep for sure.</v>

8005
03:49:42.230 --> 03:49:44.450
<v Speaker 11>So those two things we know.</v>

8006
03:49:44.451 --> 03:49:46.280
<v Speaker 11>One for sure happened and the other one,</v>

8007
03:49:46.330 --> 03:49:50.930
<v Speaker 11>it's pretty much known that they had some sort of a fist fight and they crazy</v>

8008
03:49:50.931 --> 03:49:53.000
<v Speaker 11>horse punched him and crazy horse keeps saying,</v>

8009
03:49:53.001 --> 03:49:53.691
<v Speaker 11>I'll knock you out.</v>

8010
03:49:53.691 --> 03:49:54.670
<v Speaker 11>Just like I did the last time,</v>

8011
03:49:54.680 --> 03:49:55.240
<v Speaker 11>mother fucker.</v>

8012
03:49:55.240 --> 03:49:56.150
<v Speaker 11>You know what happened?</v>

8013
03:49:56.151 --> 03:49:56.331
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

8014
03:49:56.331 --> 03:49:57.141
<v Speaker 11>You know what happened?</v>

8015
03:49:57.141 --> 03:49:58.100
<v Speaker 11>I knock you the fuck out.</v>

8016
03:49:58.101 --> 03:50:01.370
<v Speaker 11>So that seems to indicate that that's what took place.</v>

8017
03:50:02.630 --> 03:50:03.350
<v Speaker 11>I Dunno.</v>

8018
03:50:03.350 --> 03:50:05.360
<v Speaker 11>But Vandelay went out and fought after that.</v>

8019
03:50:06.200 --> 03:50:07.160
<v Speaker 11>That's fucking crazy.</v>

8020
03:50:07.970 --> 03:50:09.650
<v Speaker 11>That's if he really did get knocked out.</v>

8021
03:50:10.100 --> 03:50:11.300
<v Speaker 11>That is fucking crazy.</v>

8022
03:50:11.420 --> 03:50:13.160
<v Speaker 11>Then he went out and he fought after that.</v>

8023
03:50:13.190 --> 03:50:13.701
<v Speaker 11>In Japan.</v>

8024
03:50:13.701 --> 03:50:14.480
<v Speaker 11>You can do anything.</v>

8025
03:50:14.480 --> 03:50:14.631
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

8026
03:50:14.631 --> 03:50:15.381
<v Speaker 11>This is the fight.</v>

8027
03:50:15.381 --> 03:50:17.180
<v Speaker 11>Jamie found that he's found the street fight.</v>

8028
03:50:18.650 --> 03:50:20.450
<v Speaker 11>So this is when they go after each other</v>

8029
03:50:22.330 --> 03:50:27.190
<v Speaker 11>and Cristiana Marcel winds up on the ground with crazy horse was trying to</v>

8030
03:50:27.191 --> 03:50:28.360
<v Speaker 11>fucking ground and pound him.</v>

8031
03:50:30.190 --> 03:50:31.030
<v Speaker 11>He never seen this Joe.</v>

8032
03:50:31.031 --> 03:50:32.210
<v Speaker 11>So Joe,</v>

8033
03:50:32.230 --> 03:50:34.260
<v Speaker 11>I've seen initially this fight in this.</v>

8034
03:50:34.261 --> 03:50:34.390
<v Speaker 11>Yeah,</v>

8035
03:50:34.390 --> 03:50:35.050
<v Speaker 11>for sure.</v>

8036
03:50:35.050 --> 03:50:35.261
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

8037
03:50:35.261 --> 03:50:38.020
<v Speaker 11>This was a proof that Jujitsu worse.</v>

8038
03:50:38.320 --> 03:50:38.851
<v Speaker 11>Real good man.</v>

8039
03:50:38.851 --> 03:50:39.700
<v Speaker 11>You got jeans on.</v>

8040
03:50:40.750 --> 03:50:41.690
<v Speaker 11>It's hard to get away from them.</v>

8041
03:50:41.710 --> 03:50:42.070
<v Speaker 11>Chines.</v>

8042
03:50:42.070 --> 03:50:42.231
<v Speaker 11>Oh,</v>

8043
03:50:42.231 --> 03:50:43.064
<v Speaker 11>well he gets free.</v>

8044
03:50:43.620 --> 03:50:44.950
<v Speaker 11>I think it goes right back into it.</v>

8045
03:50:44.960 --> 03:50:45.340
<v Speaker 11>Yup.</v>

8046
03:50:45.340 --> 03:50:46.600
<v Speaker 11>Looking for some more grounded pound.</v>

8047
03:50:46.780 --> 03:50:48.490
<v Speaker 11>This is going to be a good kickbox in fight.</v>

8048
03:50:48.491 --> 03:50:52.060
<v Speaker 11>We should probably watch this cause this is the final spin or fucked up.</v>

8049
03:50:52.061 --> 03:50:55.440
<v Speaker 11>He changed his shorts as fucking Dick.</v>

8050
03:50:55.690 --> 03:50:56.201
<v Speaker 11>What do you think?</v>

8051
03:50:56.201 --> 03:50:57.034
<v Speaker 11>Why do you think you did that?</v>

8052
03:50:57.050 --> 03:50:59.140
<v Speaker 11>Sponsors probably I probably smart,</v>

8053
03:50:59.200 --> 03:50:59.900
<v Speaker 11>but yeah,</v>

8054
03:50:59.900 --> 03:51:01.390
<v Speaker 11>other ones were doper saying,</v>

8055
03:51:01.450 --> 03:51:02.650
<v Speaker 11>well they were more flashy,</v>

8056
03:51:02.651 --> 03:51:04.510
<v Speaker 11>but this you could read this sponsor is better.</v>

8057
03:51:04.780 --> 03:51:05.950
<v Speaker 11>That's why he wore them first.</v>

8058
03:51:05.980 --> 03:51:07.520
<v Speaker 11>Just to be sure that they got,</v>

8059
03:51:08.280 --> 03:51:09.071
<v Speaker 11>they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Hey Joe Shelley,</v>

8097
03:52:22.021 --> 03:52:24.450
<v Speaker 2>how come kickboxing is so much more popular in Europe?</v>

8098
03:52:25.210 --> 03:52:25.730
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

8099
03:52:25.730 --> 03:52:26.090
<v Speaker 2>aesthetic.</v>

8100
03:52:26.090 --> 03:52:30.330
<v Speaker 2>The promoters promoted better I guess in the TV deals might be different there.</v>

8101
03:52:30.390 --> 03:52:30.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

8102
03:52:30.690 --> 03:52:31.523
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know.</v>

8103
03:52:31.680 --> 03:52:31.771
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

8104
03:52:31.771 --> 03:52:34.920
<v Speaker 2>isn't it kinda crazy that it just took off so big in Holland?</v>

8105
03:52:35.190 --> 03:52:37.440
<v Speaker 2>It's big and France big and a lot of places.</v>

8106
03:52:37.500 --> 03:52:38.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

8107
03:52:38.110 --> 03:52:38.490
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

8108
03:52:38.490 --> 03:52:39.080
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

8109
03:52:39.080 --> 03:52:40.200
<v Speaker 2>It's really frustrating,</v>

8110
03:52:42.450 --> 03:52:43.590
<v Speaker 2>but it's just way bigger over there.</v>

8111
03:52:43.820 --> 03:52:44.221
<v Speaker 2>All of them.</v>

8112
03:52:44.221 --> 03:52:45.780
<v Speaker 2>It's like they were like national sport.</v>

8113
03:52:46.080 --> 03:52:49.170
<v Speaker 2>The in sports in entertainment market is kind of self contained though.</v>

8114
03:52:49.580 --> 03:52:50.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

8115
03:52:50.210 --> 03:52:50.730
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

8116
03:52:50.730 --> 03:52:51.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

8117
03:52:51.450 --> 03:52:52.380
<v Speaker 2>it is kind of right,</v>

8118
03:52:52.470 --> 03:52:52.710
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

8119
03:52:52.710 --> 03:52:53.491
<v Speaker 2>But don't you mean,</v>

8120
03:52:53.491 --> 03:52:53.761
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

8121
03:52:53.761 --> 03:52:57.660
<v Speaker 2>obviously we're attracted to this so I'm trying to like solve this puzzle.</v>

8122
03:52:57.990 --> 03:52:59.190
<v Speaker 2>If I was an investor,</v>

8123
03:52:59.191 --> 03:53:01.650
<v Speaker 2>which was clearly not well,</v>

8124
03:53:01.651 --> 03:53:03.420
<v Speaker 2>I just think it comes down to the promoter is like,</v>

8125
03:53:03.450 --> 03:53:04.283
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

8126
03:53:04.470 --> 03:53:05.303
<v Speaker 2>I'm enjoying them.</v>

8127
03:53:05.440 --> 03:53:06.540
<v Speaker 2>These fights were like that.</v>

8128
03:53:06.541 --> 03:53:07.470
<v Speaker 2>Everything is empty.</v>

8129
03:53:08.400 --> 03:53:08.820
<v Speaker 2>Is it?</v>

8130
03:53:08.820 --> 03:53:09.653
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

8131
03:53:10.680 --> 03:53:12.090
<v Speaker 2>It's like three rows of seats.</v>

8132
03:53:12.630 --> 03:53:13.350
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

8133
03:53:13.350 --> 03:53:13.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

8134
03:53:13.950 --> 03:53:14.783
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

8135
03:53:15.390 --> 03:53:15.871
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

8136
03:53:15.871 --> 03:53:16.261
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

8137
03:53:16.261 --> 03:53:17.160
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

8138
03:53:19.590 --> 03:53:20.280
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

8139
03:53:20.280 --> 03:53:20.941
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

8140
03:53:20.941 --> 03:53:22.290
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy how people make</v>

8141
03:53:24.020 --> 03:53:26.220
<v Speaker 2>these bad decisions and they don't promote it.</v>

8142
03:53:26.221 --> 03:53:27.054
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

8143
03:53:27.330 --> 03:53:28.141
<v Speaker 2>as I was saying earlier,</v>

8144
03:53:28.141 --> 03:53:30.210
<v Speaker 2>it's like you have the,</v>

8145
03:53:30.780 --> 03:53:31.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

8146
03:53:31.440 --> 03:53:32.490
<v Speaker 2>us wanting to watch it,</v>

8147
03:53:32.520 --> 03:53:33.270
<v Speaker 2>you have the,</v>

8148
03:53:33.270 --> 03:53:36.510
<v Speaker 2>the quality isn't as good fights,</v>

8149
03:53:37.320 --> 03:53:37.830
<v Speaker 2>fights,</v>

8150
03:53:37.830 --> 03:53:38.611
<v Speaker 2>things missing.</v>

8151
03:53:38.611 --> 03:53:39.450
<v Speaker 2>Why isn't it taken off?</v>

8152
03:53:39.451 --> 03:53:40.400
<v Speaker 2>You have a TV deal.</v>

8153
03:53:40.401 --> 03:53:40.860
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

8154
03:53:40.860 --> 03:53:42.330
<v Speaker 2>Here's why it hasn't taken off.</v>

8155
03:53:42.360 --> 03:53:43.590
<v Speaker 2>I think I just figured it out.</v>

8156
03:53:44.160 --> 03:53:45.900
<v Speaker 2>You remember when some of those,</v>

8157
03:53:45.901 --> 03:53:46.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

8158
03:53:46.290 --> 03:53:48.050
<v Speaker 2>street fight videos and Mazda doll,</v>

8159
03:53:48.310 --> 03:53:52.530
<v Speaker 2>we used to fight back in the day and they were saying no kicks know kicks,</v>

8160
03:53:52.920 --> 03:53:53.570
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

8161
03:53:53.570 --> 03:53:54.403
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

8162
03:53:54.540 --> 03:53:55.830
<v Speaker 2>People would complain about that.</v>

8163
03:53:56.250 --> 03:53:57.290
<v Speaker 2>I think like,</v>

8164
03:53:57.300 --> 03:54:01.530
<v Speaker 2>and now people are just now starting to accept it because of MMA or whatever.</v>

8165
03:54:01.531 --> 03:54:03.750
<v Speaker 2>But I think boxing history in,</v>

8166
03:54:03.751 --> 03:54:04.040
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

8167
03:54:04.040 --> 03:54:07.650
<v Speaker 2>in the u s for so long and in America been such a self contained sports and</v>

8168
03:54:07.680 --> 03:54:08.940
<v Speaker 2>entertainment industry.</v>

8169
03:54:09.390 --> 03:54:10.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

8170
03:54:10.100 --> 03:54:10.410
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>

8171
03:54:10.410 --> 03:54:10.840
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

8172
03:54:10.840 --> 03:54:14.940
<v Speaker 2>so self contained in the sports and entertainment industry that people are just,</v>

8173
03:54:15.050 --> 03:54:16.170
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to see kicks.</v>

8174
03:54:16.171 --> 03:54:16.460
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>

8175
03:54:16.460 --> 03:54:16.721
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

8176
03:54:16.721 --> 03:54:18.690
<v Speaker 2>it's foreign to most Americans.</v>

8177
03:54:18.691 --> 03:54:19.530
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's not,</v>

8178
03:54:19.531 --> 03:54:24.010
<v Speaker 2>it's not what we're used to here on this side of the world for</v>

8179
03:54:24.010 --> 03:54:24.843
<v Speaker 11>the most part.</v>

8180
03:54:25.210 --> 03:54:26.043
<v Speaker 11>Think about that.</v>

8181
03:54:26.110 --> 03:54:28.690
<v Speaker 11>Like I think there's probably something to that.</v>

8182
03:54:28.990 --> 03:54:29.830
<v Speaker 11>It's probably something to that.</v>

8183
03:54:29.850 --> 03:54:31.540
<v Speaker 11>But what about Bruce Lee?</v>

8184
03:54:33.090 --> 03:54:35.520
<v Speaker 11>I mean it's cool to go watch his movie.</v>

8185
03:54:35.521 --> 03:54:37.450
<v Speaker 11>So it's critical as Jackie Chan movies,</v>

8186
03:54:37.451 --> 03:54:38.410
<v Speaker 11>but for sleep,</v>

8187
03:54:38.510 --> 03:54:41.570
<v Speaker 3>Ben Damn every UFC hero of all time.</v>

8188
03:54:41.571 --> 03:54:43.190
<v Speaker 3>Like it's not that it's just promoting.</v>

8189
03:54:43.700 --> 03:54:47.000
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just bad people that get these opportunities to make mistakes and</v>

8190
03:54:47.001 --> 03:54:51.140
<v Speaker 3>they don't do a good job doing their only job to promote it.</v>

8191
03:54:51.240 --> 03:54:51.421
<v Speaker 11>Well,</v>

8192
03:54:51.421 --> 03:54:52.530
<v Speaker 11>I think it's really hard.</v>

8193
03:54:52.570 --> 03:54:53.161
<v Speaker 11>I'm old man.</v>

8194
03:54:53.161 --> 03:54:55.380
<v Speaker 11>I don't think it's necessarily that sample.</v>

8195
03:54:55.470 --> 03:54:56.820
<v Speaker 11>I see what you're talking about though.</v>

8196
03:54:56.821 --> 03:54:59.070
<v Speaker 11>As far as like the size of this arena in particular.</v>

8197
03:54:59.150 --> 03:55:00.830
<v Speaker 3>When have you ever seen a glory,</v>

8198
03:55:01.170 --> 03:55:01.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

8199

03:55:03.640 --> 03:55:08.640
<v Speaker 11>I don't know ever glory oil or kickboxing and America needs to do something.</v>

8203
03:55:10.300 --> 03:55:10.510
<v Speaker 11>Oh,</v>

8205
03:55:11.831 --> 03:55:15.460
<v Speaker 11>Bender was standing in front of them just trying to move his head and he got</v>

8206
03:55:15.461 --> 03:55:15.851
<v Speaker 11>clipped.</v>

8207
03:55:15.851 --> 03:55:17.590
<v Speaker 11>He got timed and clip with the right hand.</v>

8208
03:55:18.280 --> 03:55:19.113
<v Speaker 11>He got hit hard.</v>

8209
03:55:19.570 --> 03:55:19.721
<v Speaker 11>Oh,</v>

03:55:20.381 --> 03:55:21.370
<v Speaker 11>beautiful kick.</v>

8212
03:55:22.330 --> 03:55:23.230
<v Speaker 11>Oh my goodness.</v>

8213
03:55:24.850 --> 03:55:26.590
<v Speaker 11>Belgard Belgar oh,</v>

8214
03:55:26.591 --> 03:55:27.041
<v Speaker 11>there we go.</v>

8215
03:55:27.041 --> 03:55:27.874
<v Speaker 11>We got his name.</v>

8216
03:55:28.540 --> 03:55:29.380
<v Speaker 11>This is awesome.</v>

8217
03:55:31.100 --> 03:55:31.830
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

8218
03:55:31.830 --> 03:55:32.820
<v Speaker 11>The garlic is no joke.</v>

8219
03:55:33.090 --> 03:55:33.841
<v Speaker 11>He's a big tall,</v>

8220
03:55:33.841 --> 03:55:34.800
<v Speaker 11>skinny dude too.</v>

8221
03:55:36.580 --> 03:55:37.413
<v Speaker 8>Hm.</v>

8222
03:55:41.250 --> 03:55:42.960
<v Speaker 11>When you see a guy like semi shell,</v>

8223
03:55:44.100 --> 03:55:48.900
<v Speaker 11>that's when you realize how much like when utilized correctly reached plays a</v>

8224
03:55:48.901 --> 03:55:49.734
<v Speaker 11>factor.</v>

8225
03:55:49.800 --> 03:55:51.240
<v Speaker 11>He's got his timing down.</v>

8226
03:55:52.820 --> 03:55:55.380
<v Speaker 11>He slipped in that right hand a little often,</v>

8227
03:55:55.410 --> 03:55:56.950
<v Speaker 11>but he's trying to come back with that left bell.</v>

8228
03:55:56.970 --> 03:55:59.400
<v Speaker 11>Garu Bell Guy is,</v>

8229
03:55:59.430 --> 03:55:59.970
<v Speaker 11>that's how you say it,</v>

8230
03:55:59.970 --> 03:56:00.803
<v Speaker 11>Jamie,</v>

8231
03:56:01.860 --> 03:56:06.860
<v Speaker 11>but got her Guari Guari re Oui.</v>

8232
03:56:08.160 --> 03:56:11.300
<v Speaker 11>Like we re Gari.</v>

8233
03:56:12.000 --> 03:56:12.833
<v Speaker 11>Okay.</v>

8234
03:56:12.930 --> 03:56:14.100
<v Speaker 11>He's from Tunisia.</v>

8235
03:56:14.670 --> 03:56:17.830
<v Speaker 11>They probably don't even use our letters today.</v>

8236
03:56:18.860 --> 03:56:22.050
<v Speaker 11>They probably got some cryptic Celtic look in speech.</v>

8237
03:56:22.620 --> 03:56:27.620
<v Speaker 11>What does Tunisia use for language that was kind of an Asian Tunisian?</v>

8238
03:56:27.990 --> 03:56:28.823
<v Speaker 11>What does it look like?</v>

8239
03:56:29.840 --> 03:56:30.690
<v Speaker 11>It was like Russian.</v>

8240
03:56:32.820 --> 03:56:36.270
<v Speaker 11>I'm just guessing like rushing to me is the coolest shit ever because it's like</v>

8241
03:56:36.271 --> 03:56:38.220
<v Speaker 11>you're reading some forgotten scrolls,</v>

8242
03:56:38.820 --> 03:56:39.660
<v Speaker 11>you know?</v>

8243
03:56:40.020 --> 03:56:40.560
<v Speaker 11>It was like,</v>

8244
03:56:40.560 --> 03:56:42.360
<v Speaker 11>it's almost like it has characters.</v>

8245
03:56:42.480 --> 03:56:42.751
<v Speaker 11>What is it,</v>

8246
03:56:42.751 --> 03:56:43.500
<v Speaker 11>Jamie?</v>

8247
03:56:43.500 --> 03:56:43.621
<v Speaker 11>Oh,</v>

8248
03:56:43.621 --> 03:56:44.220
<v Speaker 11>it's Arabic.</v>

8249
03:56:44.220 --> 03:56:44.580
<v Speaker 11>Okay.</v>

8250
03:56:44.580 --> 03:56:45.930
<v Speaker 11>So they're writing is an Arabic as well.</v>

8251
03:56:48.330 --> 03:56:49.163
<v Speaker 11>Interesting.</v>

8252
03:56:50.990 --> 03:56:51.330
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

8253
03:56:51.330 --> 03:56:53.000
<v Speaker 11>Arabic and Hebrew.</v>

8254
03:56:53.040 --> 03:56:53.970
<v Speaker 11>Hebrew was another one.</v>

8255
03:56:54.480 --> 03:56:55.680
<v Speaker 11>That's cool looking language,</v>

8256
03:56:55.681 --> 03:56:56.440
<v Speaker 11>right.</v>

8257
03:56:56.440 --> 03:56:58.590
<v Speaker 11>Looks like speak French apparently.</v>

8258
03:56:58.591 --> 03:57:00.570
<v Speaker 11>Which might be where his last name.</v>

8259
03:57:00.980 --> 03:57:01.150
<v Speaker 11>Ah,</v>

8260
03:57:01.150 --> 03:57:02.040
<v Speaker 11>that makes sense.</v>

8261
03:57:02.130 --> 03:57:03.210
<v Speaker 11>Bed gouty</v>

8262
03:57:04.710 --> 03:57:05.543
<v Speaker 11>interesting.</v>

8263
03:57:08.140 --> 03:57:12.520
<v Speaker 11>The world is so much more diverse than the eight one eight man.</v>

8264
03:57:12.521 --> 03:57:13.181
<v Speaker 11>You say that.</v>

8265
03:57:13.181 --> 03:57:15.220
<v Speaker 11>But when I came here from Texas I was,</v>

8266
03:57:15.280 --> 03:57:16.001
<v Speaker 11>I mean Texas,</v>

8267
03:57:16.001 --> 03:57:17.740
<v Speaker 11>I thought Texas is pretty diverse in it.</v>

8268
03:57:18.430 --> 03:57:19.480
<v Speaker 11>It is in its own right.</v>

8269
03:57:19.481 --> 03:57:21.590
<v Speaker 11>But in Texas I felt like there were,</v>

8270
03:57:21.620 --> 03:57:22.340
<v Speaker 11>there were,</v>

8271
03:57:22.340 --> 03:57:24.290
<v Speaker 13>there was it in Houston specifically,</v>

8272
03:57:24.380 --> 03:57:27.740
<v Speaker 13>there is a part of Houston that's a Vietnamese community.</v>

8273
03:57:28.080 --> 03:57:32.810
<v Speaker 13>Then as a part of using that to spa Hispanic community and then then you have</v>

8274
03:57:32.811 --> 03:57:33.950
<v Speaker 13>black and white people,</v>

8275
03:57:34.310 --> 03:57:38.630
<v Speaker 13>but like you come here and it's like there's Armenians and there's Russians and</v>

8276
03:57:38.631 --> 03:57:43.631
<v Speaker 13>there is Vietnamese and Koreans and Chinese and Japanese and like everybody's</v>

8277
03:57:43.791 --> 03:57:43.970
<v Speaker 13>here.</v>

8278
03:57:43.970 --> 03:57:47.440
<v Speaker 13>This is really diverse compared to what it's like in.</v>

8279
03:57:47.650 --> 03:57:48.483
<v Speaker 13>Gotcha.</v>

8280
03:57:48.500 --> 03:57:48.891
<v Speaker 13>Very good.</v>

8281
03:57:48.891 --> 03:57:49.724
<v Speaker 13>Cracked</v>

8282
03:57:52.000 --> 03:57:52.833
<v Speaker 8>hope to show that</v>

8283
03:57:55.850 --> 03:57:56.611
<v Speaker 8>it was beautiful.</v>

8284
03:57:56.611 --> 03:57:57.444
<v Speaker 8>Right down.</v>

8285
03:58:01.600 --> 03:58:02.433
<v Speaker 13>Um,</v>

8286
03:58:02.890 --> 03:58:03.611
<v Speaker 13>do you feel like,</v>

8287
03:58:03.611 --> 03:58:04.170
<v Speaker 13>uh,</v>

8288
03:58:04.170 --> 03:58:04.931
<v Speaker 13>like a particular,</v>

8289
03:58:04.931 --> 03:58:07.540
<v Speaker 13>like you were saying about the confederate flags,</v>

8290
03:58:08.170 --> 03:58:13.150
<v Speaker 13>you feel like it's Houston and Texas in general still has just a little too much</v>

8291
03:58:13.151 --> 03:58:18.151
<v Speaker 13>old stupid shit going on there in terms of racism and mentality and,</v>

8292
03:58:18.760 --> 03:58:19.241
<v Speaker 13>yeah.</v>

8293
03:58:19.241 --> 03:58:19.840
<v Speaker 13>And it's,</v>

8294
03:58:19.840 --> 03:58:20.673
<v Speaker 13>it's,</v>

8295
03:58:20.710 --> 03:58:21.543
<v Speaker 13>it's not,</v>

8296
03:58:23.380 --> 03:58:26.770
<v Speaker 13>it's weird because it doesn't exist everywhere.</v>

8297
03:58:26.950 --> 03:58:27.550
<v Speaker 13>Right.</v>

8298
03:58:27.550 --> 03:58:28.030
<v Speaker 13>You know,</v>

8299
03:58:28.030 --> 03:58:28.863
<v Speaker 13>um,</v>

8300
03:58:28.960 --> 03:58:29.950
<v Speaker 13>and I'm sure it's,</v>

8301
03:58:29.951 --> 03:58:32.050
<v Speaker 13>it's kind of even hidden in some places,</v>

8302
03:58:32.051 --> 03:58:34.600
<v Speaker 13>but it's hidden everywhere at some point.</v>

8303
03:58:35.050 --> 03:58:37.220
<v Speaker 13>But in Houston it's</v>

8304
03:58:38.830 --> 03:58:39.910
<v Speaker 13>inside the city,</v>

8305
03:58:40.120 --> 03:58:43.630
<v Speaker 13>it's pretty diverse as far as those communities that I just mentioned,</v>

8306
03:58:43.631 --> 03:58:45.460
<v Speaker 13>those people are pretty well represented.</v>

8307
03:58:45.940 --> 03:58:48.430
<v Speaker 13>But then when you get on the outskirts of town,</v>

8308
03:58:49.650 --> 03:58:51.250
<v Speaker 13>and there's a lot of outskirts,</v>

8309
03:58:51.760 --> 03:58:52.930
<v Speaker 13>because here,</v>

8310
03:58:53.560 --> 03:58:53.921
<v Speaker 13>I mean,</v>

8311
03:58:53.921 --> 03:58:54.571
<v Speaker 13>everybody's in,</v>

8312
03:58:54.571 --> 03:58:55.720
<v Speaker 13>in a small area,</v>

8313
03:58:55.960 --> 03:59:00.550
<v Speaker 13>it's like I drive 10 miles here and it takes me 30 minutes.</v>

8314
03:59:00.880 --> 03:59:01.571
<v Speaker 13>But in Houston,</v>

8315
03:59:01.571 --> 03:59:03.280
<v Speaker 13>10 miles takes me 10 minutes.</v>

8316
03:59:04.360 --> 03:59:07.900
<v Speaker 13>I say there's so many more people here and it's such a smaller area.</v>

8317
03:59:08.470 --> 03:59:11.560
<v Speaker 13>So it also gives rural real quick.</v>

8318
03:59:11.950 --> 03:59:12.551
<v Speaker 13>In Texas.</v>

8319
03:59:12.551 --> 03:59:12.760
<v Speaker 13>Yeah,</v>

8320
03:59:12.760 --> 03:59:13.593
<v Speaker 13>for sure.</v>

8321
03:59:13.960 --> 03:59:15.730
<v Speaker 13>It gets wild pigs rural,</v>

8322
03:59:16.810 --> 03:59:17.643
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

8323
03:59:17.720 --> 03:59:17.970
<v Speaker 13>if,</v>

8324
03:59:17.970 --> 03:59:18.760
<v Speaker 13>if you,</v>

8325
03:59:18.760 --> 03:59:19.990
<v Speaker 13>if you get on a highway,</v>

8326
03:59:21.190 --> 03:59:23.000
<v Speaker 13>if you're on a highway in Texas,</v>

8327
03:59:23.320 --> 03:59:25.230
<v Speaker 13>any direction you start and stay,</v>

8328
03:59:25.240 --> 03:59:26.500
<v Speaker 13>you start in the center of Houston,</v>

8329
03:59:26.890 --> 03:59:27.970
<v Speaker 13>you get on a highway,</v>

8330
03:59:28.030 --> 03:59:30.700
<v Speaker 13>it would no traffic any direction in 30 minutes.</v>

8331
03:59:30.701 --> 03:59:31.534
<v Speaker 13>You're,</v>

8332
03:59:32.020 --> 03:59:32.351
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

8333
03:59:32.351 --> 03:59:33.760
<v Speaker 13>you're not in the city anymore.</v>

8334
03:59:33.820 --> 03:59:33.990
<v Speaker 13>You're,</v>

8335
03:59:33.990 --> 03:59:34.511
<v Speaker 13>you're,</v>

8336
03:59:34.511 --> 03:59:38.050
<v Speaker 13>you're aware houses are far apart and they're huge and they're,</v>

8337
03:59:38.740 --> 03:59:39.573
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

8338
03:59:40.140 --> 03:59:42.130
<v Speaker 13>those ranches people,</v>

8339
03:59:42.420 --> 03:59:45.430
<v Speaker 13>giant swaths of land with probably 45 minutes.</v>

8340
03:59:45.700 --> 03:59:47.470
<v Speaker 13>Wild pigs running around.</v>

8341
03:59:48.100 --> 03:59:48.281
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

8342
03:59:48.281 --> 03:59:49.520
<v Speaker 13>Texas is a trap.</v>

8343
03:59:49.521 --> 03:59:50.241
<v Speaker 13>It really is.</v>

8344
03:59:50.241 --> 03:59:51.580
<v Speaker 13>It's one of the weirdest states.</v>

8345
03:59:52.170 --> 03:59:53.290
<v Speaker 13>It's one of my favorite though.</v>

8346
03:59:53.770 --> 03:59:54.640
<v Speaker 13>Such a wild,</v>

8347
03:59:54.641 --> 03:59:55.474
<v Speaker 13>crazy place.</v>

8348
03:59:56.170 --> 03:59:57.850
<v Speaker 13>But yeah,</v>

8349
03:59:57.851 --> 03:59:58.630
<v Speaker 13>it's um,</v>

8350
03:59:58.630 --> 04:00:00.280
<v Speaker 13>it's very unique in that aspect.</v>

8351
04:00:00.281 --> 04:00:01.720
<v Speaker 13>Like how big it is too.</v>

8352
04:00:01.790 --> 04:00:02.310
<v Speaker 13>It's big.</v>

8353
04:00:02.310 --> 04:00:03.730
<v Speaker 13>We got 85 mile an hour.</v>

8354
04:00:03.731 --> 04:00:04.564
<v Speaker 13>Highway</v>

8355
04:00:07.870 --> 04:00:09.310
<v Speaker 13>55 was the limit.</v>

8356
04:00:09.850 --> 04:00:12.520
<v Speaker 13>What in the fuck was going on with people?</v>

8357
04:00:13.750 --> 04:00:17.410
<v Speaker 13>55 that was crazy.</v>

8358
04:00:17.680 --> 04:00:18.450
<v Speaker 13>That is crazy.</v>

8359
04:00:18.450 --> 04:00:18.791
<v Speaker 13>It was just,</v>

8360
04:00:18.791 --> 04:00:19.560
<v Speaker 13>so,</v>

8361
04:00:19.560 --> 04:00:19.861
<v Speaker 13>it's like,</v>

8362
04:00:19.861 --> 04:00:20.010
<v Speaker 13>come</v>

8363
04:00:20.010 --> 04:00:20.700
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

8364
04:00:20.700 --> 04:00:22.560
<v Speaker 1>we're not talking about like a model t,</v>

8365
04:00:22.860 --> 04:00:23.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8366
04:00:23.101 --> 04:00:25.890
<v Speaker 1>these cars are safe and competent and above speeds.</v>

8367
04:00:26.380 --> 04:00:30.540
<v Speaker 1>The 55 of my car says it can go one 40 it's just stupid.</v>

8368
04:00:31.230 --> 04:00:33.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean not that you should be gone one 40 but you know what?</v>

8369
04:00:33.811 --> 04:00:36.210
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting argument about the Audubon man.</v>

8370
04:00:36.480 --> 04:00:36.721
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

8371
04:00:36.721 --> 04:00:39.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily know it's a bad one either.</v>

8372
04:00:39.001 --> 04:00:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Like what adults do?</v>

8373
04:00:39.991 --> 04:00:44.580
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the fuck they want know and just have good etiquette move over when</v>

8374
04:00:44.581 --> 04:00:46.470
<v Speaker 1>there's a faster car coming behind you.</v>

8375
04:00:46.560 --> 04:00:48.210
<v Speaker 1>What's the statistics on that?</v>

8376
04:00:49.980 --> 04:00:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Bond is actually safer.</v>

8377
04:00:51.860 --> 04:00:54.030
<v Speaker 1>Bet people get the fuck out of the way.</v>

8378
04:00:54.031 --> 04:00:54.391
<v Speaker 1>Like this.</v>

8379
04:00:54.391 --> 04:00:56.220
<v Speaker 1>Some bad shit going on in any of the other ones.</v>

8380
04:00:56.840 --> 04:00:58.680
<v Speaker 1>So something a couple days ago,</v>

8381
04:00:58.681 --> 04:00:59.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember where I saw it.</v>

8382
04:00:59.840 --> 04:01:00.070
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

8383
04:01:00.070 --> 04:01:00.781
<v Speaker 1>if I can find it,</v>

8384
04:01:00.781 --> 04:01:01.441
<v Speaker 1>I'll send it to you.</v>

8385
04:01:01.441 --> 04:01:05.860
<v Speaker 1>But they were talking about how people get over out of the,</v>

8386
04:01:06.050 --> 04:01:08.330
<v Speaker 1>the fast lane on the Autobahn.</v>

8387
04:01:08.340 --> 04:01:12.330
<v Speaker 1>People don't stay in the fast and they just use that lane to pass and get out of</v>

8388
04:01:12.331 --> 04:01:12.930
<v Speaker 1>that lane.</v>

8389
04:01:12.930 --> 04:01:13.830
<v Speaker 1>That's what it should be.</v>

8390
04:01:14.850 --> 04:01:15.511
<v Speaker 1>That's what it should be.</v>

8391
04:01:15.511 --> 04:01:16.720
<v Speaker 1>That's the passing lane ran.</v>

8392
04:01:16.800 --> 04:01:17.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8393
04:01:17.070 --> 04:01:19.290
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be just La.</v>

8394
04:01:19.291 --> 04:01:21.450
<v Speaker 1>They're just have total disregard for that shit.</v>

8395
04:01:21.760 --> 04:01:26.050
<v Speaker 1>Never been to a place that has more disregard for the left lane in La are</v>

8396
04:01:26.160 --> 04:01:26.570
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

8397
04:01:26.570 --> 04:01:26.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8398
04:01:26.730 --> 04:01:28.020
<v Speaker 1>Nobody can sound the left lane.</v>

8399
04:01:28.110 --> 04:01:29.490
<v Speaker 1>And I watched people get mad.</v>

8400
04:01:29.491 --> 04:01:31.740
<v Speaker 1>People pull up behind people and watch them get pissed.</v>

8401
04:01:31.940 --> 04:01:32.820
<v Speaker 1>The fuck the fuck.</v>

8402
04:01:32.821 --> 04:01:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Like oh you must be new.</v>

8403
04:01:36.660 --> 04:01:39.360
<v Speaker 1>Because in Boston people,</v>

8404
04:01:39.390 --> 04:01:41.220
<v Speaker 1>first of all they have will small roads.</v>

8405
04:01:41.280 --> 04:01:45.100
<v Speaker 1>Like in Boston you could be on a highway and it's two lanes on each side and</v>

8406
04:01:45.140 --> 04:01:47.340
<v Speaker 1>there's some stupid little rinky dank highways.</v>

8407
04:01:47.341 --> 04:01:50.910
<v Speaker 1>They were invented pack when people wrote buggies and horses and shit.</v>

8408
04:01:51.000 --> 04:01:51.870
<v Speaker 1>They just paved them.</v>

8409
04:01:51.960 --> 04:01:52.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

8410
04:01:52.231 --> 04:01:53.820
<v Speaker 1>they just paved over those fucking things.</v>

8411
04:01:53.821 --> 04:01:55.110
<v Speaker 1>That's how you got to get to the Cape.</v>

8412
04:01:55.420 --> 04:01:57.500
<v Speaker 1>You gotta take these to get to Cape Cod.</v>

8413
04:01:57.501 --> 04:02:01.230
<v Speaker 1>You gotta take these stupid ass roads that are like two lanes long in some spots</v>

8414
04:02:01.290 --> 04:02:02.820
<v Speaker 1>are two lanes wide and soft spots.</v>

8415
04:02:03.090 --> 04:02:04.380
<v Speaker 1>So when someone's coming behind you,</v>

8416
04:02:04.381 --> 04:02:05.520
<v Speaker 1>there's no options.</v>

8417
04:02:05.540 --> 04:02:06.373
<v Speaker 1>Just get over,</v>

8418
04:02:06.720 --> 04:02:07.021
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

8419
04:02:07.021 --> 04:02:09.540
<v Speaker 1>So people usually respect that left lane.</v>

8420
04:02:10.040 --> 04:02:11.460
<v Speaker 1>You New York is a lot of that too,</v>

8421
04:02:11.461 --> 04:02:12.150
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

8422
04:02:12.150 --> 04:02:16.290
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of like rinky dink streets so you wouldn't believe on the way</v>

8423
04:02:16.291 --> 04:02:21.070
<v Speaker 1>to the airport when you leave New York and you've got to go through a what?</v>

8424
04:02:21.080 --> 04:02:21.571
<v Speaker 1>What is it,</v>

8425
04:02:21.571 --> 04:02:24.420
<v Speaker 1>queens or what is it that you got to go through?</v>

8426
04:02:24.421 --> 04:02:25.254
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn?</v>

8427
04:02:25.560 --> 04:02:26.670
<v Speaker 1>Depends on which airport.</v>

8428
04:02:26.671 --> 04:02:27.060
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

8429
04:02:27.060 --> 04:02:28.890
<v Speaker 1>Laguardia and JFK.</v>

8430
04:02:29.100 --> 04:02:31.110
<v Speaker 1>Either way you leave Manhattan,</v>

8431
04:02:31.650 --> 04:02:33.240
<v Speaker 1>those towns that you have to go through,</v>

8432
04:02:33.510 --> 04:02:37.680
<v Speaker 1>there's sometimes you're driving on these little tiny ass fucking super narrow</v>

8433
04:02:37.681 --> 04:02:38.520
<v Speaker 1>roads and you're like,</v>

8434
04:02:38.521 --> 04:02:39.354
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>

8435
04:02:39.540 --> 04:02:41.820
<v Speaker 1>This is all these fucking people are going to the airport.</v>

8436
04:02:41.850 --> 04:02:42.810
<v Speaker 1>Like this is crazy,</v>

8437
04:02:43.240 --> 04:02:48.240
<v Speaker 1>but you can use that for oh five in la where it's just lanes on this side lanes</v>

8438
04:02:50.251 --> 04:02:51.120
<v Speaker 1>on that side.</v>

8439
04:02:51.690 --> 04:02:52.710
<v Speaker 1>I lived in Houston,</v>

8440
04:02:52.711 --> 04:02:53.510
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

8441
04:02:53.510 --> 04:02:56.700
<v Speaker 1>I 10 in Houston in the Katy area.</v>

8442
04:02:57.150 --> 04:03:01.380
<v Speaker 1>There's five lanes on heading west and his five lanes.</v>

8443
04:03:01.381 --> 04:03:02.214
<v Speaker 1>Any east,</v>

8444
04:03:02.340 --> 04:03:06.070
<v Speaker 1>I think it's five and then there are two or three we have.</v>

8445
04:03:06.100 --> 04:03:06.930
<v Speaker 1>You don't have them here.</v>

8446
04:03:06.930 --> 04:03:07.500
<v Speaker 1>Feeders.</v>

8447
04:03:07.500 --> 04:03:09.540
<v Speaker 1>We have feeder roads in service roads in Texas,</v>

8448
04:03:09.541 --> 04:03:10.920
<v Speaker 1>so next to the highway.</v>

8449
04:03:10.921 --> 04:03:15.180
<v Speaker 1>If I wanted to drive from downtown Houston to Katy,</v>

8450
04:03:15.210 --> 04:03:18.310
<v Speaker 1>which is probably 15 to 20 I can do that</v>

8451
04:03:18.370 --> 04:03:22.300
<v Speaker 2>next to the freeway without actually getting on the freeway because I not</v>

8452
04:03:22.301 --> 04:03:22.811
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

8453
04:03:22.811 --> 04:03:26.140
<v Speaker 2>but there are people that do this because they're afraid to drive it.</v>

8454
04:03:26.141 --> 04:03:27.040
<v Speaker 2>Those high speeds.</v>

8455
04:03:27.340 --> 04:03:32.020
<v Speaker 2>So there are stop lights at every intersection on this feeder road that's next</v>

8456
04:03:32.021 --> 04:03:32.854
<v Speaker 2>to the highway.</v>

8457
04:03:33.070 --> 04:03:34.870
<v Speaker 2>It's a 35 mile an hour street,</v>

8458
04:03:35.050 --> 04:03:37.390
<v Speaker 2>but it feeds right on to the highway.</v>

8459
04:03:37.420 --> 04:03:38.710
<v Speaker 2>There's a picture of it right there.</v>

8460
04:03:39.240 --> 04:03:39.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

8461
04:03:39.880 --> 04:03:42.010
<v Speaker 2>So those little roads on the side,</v>

8462
04:03:42.400 --> 04:03:43.960
<v Speaker 2>those roads feed onto the highway.</v>

8463
04:03:43.961 --> 04:03:44.621
<v Speaker 2>When you exit,</v>

8464
04:03:44.621 --> 04:03:46.480
<v Speaker 2>you exit off onto the side like that.</v>

8465
04:03:47.590 --> 04:03:49.420
<v Speaker 2>That's actually a really good idea.</v>

8466
04:03:49.750 --> 04:03:50.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

8467
04:03:50.170 --> 04:03:50.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

8468
04:03:50.620 --> 04:03:51.440
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

8469
04:03:51.440 --> 04:03:56.440
<v Speaker 2>do you see how much rote that's 13 lanes of road or [inaudible] 14 lanes of</v>

8470
04:03:56.861 --> 04:03:57.341
<v Speaker 2>highway water?</v>

8471
04:03:57.341 --> 04:03:58.174
<v Speaker 2>The better,</v>

8472
04:03:58.710 --> 04:03:59.650
<v Speaker 2>the more the better.</v>

8473
04:03:59.651 --> 04:04:00.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm not in a waiting.</v>

8474
04:04:02.680 --> 04:04:04.450
<v Speaker 2>I think we should just make it all highway.</v>

8475
04:04:04.451 --> 04:04:05.590
<v Speaker 2>Why we fucking around?</v>

8476
04:04:05.610 --> 04:04:06.030
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

8477
04:04:06.030 --> 04:04:08.620
<v Speaker 2>We need to have floating houses and everything else is highway.</v>

8478
04:04:09.940 --> 04:04:11.670
<v Speaker 11>Just shoot right up to your floating house.</v>

8479
04:04:12.300 --> 04:04:15.060
<v Speaker 11>It's what point in time do we tell people we can't build any more houses?</v>

8480
04:04:17.240 --> 04:04:17.440
<v Speaker 11>Were,</v>

8481
04:04:17.440 --> 04:04:17.710
<v Speaker 11>were,</v>

8482
04:04:17.710 --> 04:04:18.543
<v Speaker 11>were</v>

8483
04:04:18.990 --> 04:04:20.520
<v Speaker 2>I think about things like that.</v>

8484
04:04:20.960 --> 04:04:21.140
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

8485
04:04:21.140 --> 04:04:21.511
<v Speaker 2>if we,</v>

8486
04:04:21.511 --> 04:04:22.770
<v Speaker 2>if we survive,</v>

8487
04:04:23.010 --> 04:04:26.850
<v Speaker 2>if there are species survives for another couple of hundred years,</v>

8488
04:04:27.270 --> 04:04:27.511
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

8489
04:04:27.511 --> 04:04:30.810
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be no more trees or plants or like everything is going to be</v>

8490
04:04:30.811 --> 04:04:32.280
<v Speaker 2>house then we have to build up.</v>

8491
04:04:33.720 --> 04:04:35.970
<v Speaker 2>Well there's a lot of space right now,</v>

8492
04:04:36.180 --> 04:04:39.180
<v Speaker 2>but there's so much more people now than there's ever been before.</v>

8493
04:04:39.181 --> 04:04:40.620
<v Speaker 2>Like by a long shot.</v>

8494
04:04:40.650 --> 04:04:40.951
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

8495
04:04:40.951 --> 04:04:41.701
<v Speaker 2>Think about like,</v>

8496
04:04:41.701 --> 04:04:42.660
<v Speaker 2>think about the uh,</v>

8497
04:04:42.661 --> 04:04:47.640
<v Speaker 2>the increase in people over the last just a few years over the last century.</v>

8498
04:04:47.820 --> 04:04:48.121
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

8499
04:04:48.121 --> 04:04:53.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think we were talking about it once where it was 1970.</v>

8500
04:04:53.420 --> 04:04:54.980
<v Speaker 11>There was 2 billion people on the planet.</v>

8501
04:04:55.010 --> 04:04:55.780
<v Speaker 11>Was that what it was?</v>

8502
04:04:55.780 --> 04:04:56.080
<v Speaker 11>No.</v>

8503
04:04:56.080 --> 04:04:56.331
<v Speaker 11>What does it,</v>

8504
04:04:56.331 --> 04:04:57.260
<v Speaker 11>Jamie boy,</v>

8505
04:04:57.320 --> 04:04:58.460
<v Speaker 11>you were talking about this the other day.</v>

8506
04:04:58.580 --> 04:05:02.170
<v Speaker 11>There's some people say that we could be on a decline right now to those people.</v>

8507
04:05:02.180 --> 04:05:02.800
<v Speaker 11>Right.</v>

8508
04:05:02.800 --> 04:05:03.170
<v Speaker 11>Smarter,</v>

8509
04:05:03.170 --> 04:05:05.180
<v Speaker 11>younger people are not having babies.</v>

8510
04:05:05.350 --> 04:05:06.280
<v Speaker 11>Whatever.</v>

8511
04:05:06.980 --> 04:05:08.510
<v Speaker 11>I've heard that argument before.</v>

8512
04:05:08.511 --> 04:05:12.510
<v Speaker 11>I think it's horse shit cause the dummies or having 1520 kids and makeup of</v>

8513
04:05:12.520 --> 04:05:15.860
<v Speaker 11>those smart people they know declines going on and it might be a d client.</v>

8514
04:05:15.861 --> 04:05:17.260
<v Speaker 11>Smart people in mind.</v>

8515
04:05:17.261 --> 04:05:18.260
<v Speaker 11>New York borough.</v>

8516
04:05:18.261 --> 04:05:21.140
<v Speaker 11>I've noticed in my co op there's a decrease.</v>

8517
04:05:21.290 --> 04:05:23.030
<v Speaker 11>Smart people having babies.</v>

8518
04:05:23.270 --> 04:05:25.250
<v Speaker 11>Everybody should be allowed to make one copy.</v>

8519
04:05:25.670 --> 04:05:26.031
<v Speaker 11>Yeah,</v>

8520
04:05:26.031 --> 04:05:27.380
<v Speaker 11>there's a lot of copies out there.</v>

8521
04:05:27.381 --> 04:05:29.210
<v Speaker 11>Have some really shitty original work.</v>

8522
04:05:30.380 --> 04:05:31.700
<v Speaker 11>That's a part of the problem.</v>

8523
04:05:33.130 --> 04:05:37.010
<v Speaker 11>Like just the sheer genetic tools that you had to work with.</v>

8524
04:05:37.011 --> 04:05:38.330
<v Speaker 11>We're not the best</v>

8525
04:05:40.400 --> 04:05:41.030
<v Speaker 11>one.</v>

8526
04:05:41.030 --> 04:05:41.271
<v Speaker 11>Okay.</v>

8527
04:05:41.271 --> 04:05:41.721
<v Speaker 11>Here it is.</v>

8528
04:05:41.721 --> 04:05:42.470
<v Speaker 11>Japan,</v>

8529
04:05:42.470 --> 04:05:42.981
<v Speaker 11>Japan.</v>

8530
04:05:42.981 --> 04:05:44.810
<v Speaker 11>Well Japan has a giant issue though.</v>

8531
04:05:44.811 --> 04:05:45.710
<v Speaker 11>They they do,</v>

8532
04:05:45.950 --> 04:05:47.120
<v Speaker 11>they have a weird issue.</v>

8533
04:05:47.720 --> 04:05:48.231
<v Speaker 11>They have a,</v>

8534
04:05:48.231 --> 04:05:51.710
<v Speaker 11>an issue of a lot of people that are choosing to not get married,</v>

8535
04:05:51.711 --> 04:05:53.630
<v Speaker 11>not have sex there.</v>

8536
04:05:53.631 --> 04:05:56.120
<v Speaker 11>They have people that are choosing to stay at home like,</v>

8537
04:05:56.810 --> 04:06:00.590
<v Speaker 11>like really as they're getting older and massive population decline.</v>

8538
04:06:00.860 --> 04:06:01.693
<v Speaker 11>Wow.</v>

8539
04:06:02.650 --> 04:06:03.250
<v Speaker 11>Don't know.</v>

8540
04:06:03.250 --> 04:06:04.400
<v Speaker 11>I don't want to hear the decline.</v>

8541
04:06:04.401 --> 04:06:05.480
<v Speaker 11>I want to know what was the,</v>

8542
04:06:05.540 --> 04:06:10.540
<v Speaker 11>what was the population in 1970 world world population 1970 so us was 200 200</v>

8543
04:06:15.860 --> 04:06:16.040
<v Speaker 11>million.</v>

8544
04:06:16.040 --> 04:06:19.220
<v Speaker 11>So it's 300,000,050 now,</v>

8545
04:06:19.221 --> 04:06:20.360
<v Speaker 11>350 million now</v>

8546
04:06:22.210 --> 04:06:22.730
<v Speaker 11>billion.</v>

8547
04:06:22.730 --> 04:06:27.730
<v Speaker 11>So 3.7 billion in 1970 so since 1970 the world has doubled.</v>

8548
04:06:28.550 --> 04:06:33.550
<v Speaker 11>The world doubled in the United States has gone up by 50% right.</v>

8549
04:06:35.660 --> 04:06:37.420
<v Speaker 11>So I guess growth is slowing.</v>

8550
04:06:37.430 --> 04:06:37.670
<v Speaker 11>Wait,</v>

8551
04:06:37.670 --> 04:06:41.510
<v Speaker 11>so the world is dealt with 50% not 50% of the world doubling.</v>

8552
04:06:41.511 --> 04:06:41.900
<v Speaker 11>Okay.</v>

8553
04:06:41.900 --> 04:06:42.261
<v Speaker 11>Right.</v>

8554
04:06:42.261 --> 04:06:43.610
<v Speaker 11>50% of what the United States,</v>

8555
04:06:43.611 --> 04:06:48.611
<v Speaker 11>why the United States was 200 million and now it's 300 million plus,</v>

8556
04:06:48.860 --> 04:06:49.220
<v Speaker 11>right?</v>

8557
04:06:49.220 --> 04:06:50.360
<v Speaker 11>That's 50% isn't it?</v>

8558
04:06:54.890 --> 04:06:55.310
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

8559
04:06:55.310 --> 04:06:55.930
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

8560
04:06:55.930 --> 04:06:56.740
<v Speaker 11>That's a lot.</v>

8561
04:06:56.740 --> 04:06:58.210
<v Speaker 11>But the world is doubled.</v>

8562
04:06:58.330 --> 04:07:00.940
<v Speaker 11>So the world went up 100% so we are,</v>

8563
04:07:01.510 --> 04:07:06.340
<v Speaker 11>we're at a slower pace than some of those poor fools that live in other,</v>

8564
04:07:06.940 --> 04:07:07.773
<v Speaker 11>other countries.</v>

8565
04:07:08.250 --> 04:07:11.290
<v Speaker 11>It was poor people not blessed to be American.</v>

8566
04:07:11.420 --> 04:07:13.100
<v Speaker 12>After this decision.</v>

8567
04:07:13.101 --> 04:07:15.620
<v Speaker 12>I need an audio pause so my tape doesn't stop here.</v>

8568
04:07:15.680 --> 04:07:16.340
<v Speaker 12>Oh,</v>

8569
04:07:16.340 --> 04:07:17.930
<v Speaker 12>that's something might happen with the tri caster.</v>

8570
04:07:17.931 --> 04:07:18.320
<v Speaker 12>I can,</v>

8571
04:07:18.320 --> 04:07:19.430
<v Speaker 12>something might have happened with it.</v>

8572
04:07:19.490 --> 04:07:21.110
<v Speaker 12>It says I'm running out of space.</v>

8573
04:07:21.140 --> 04:07:21.790
<v Speaker 12>What does that mean?</v>

8574
04:07:21.790 --> 04:07:21.881
<v Speaker 12>Well,</v>

8575
04:07:21.881 --> 04:07:25.140
<v Speaker 12>now I don't know if that means it's going to cut the whole Edison.</v>

8576
04:07:25.270 --> 04:07:25.820
<v Speaker 12>Yeah,</v>

8577
04:07:25.820 --> 04:07:26.710
<v Speaker 12>I don't need this space,</v>

8578
04:07:26.711 --> 04:07:26.930
<v Speaker 12>but,</v>

8579
04:07:26.930 --> 04:07:27.290
<v Speaker 12>okay,</v>

8580
04:07:27.290 --> 04:07:28.400
<v Speaker 12>well let's pause now.</v>

8581
04:07:28.750 --> 04:07:29.810
<v Speaker 12>Only like five seconds.</v>

8582
04:07:30.410 --> 04:07:31.280
<v Speaker 12>We'll be right back.</v>

8583
04:07:32.610 --> 04:07:33.860
<v Speaker 12>Is a youtube still up?</v>

8584
04:07:34.280 --> 04:07:35.113
<v Speaker 12>Okay.</v>

8585
04:07:35.660 --> 04:07:37.340
<v Speaker 12>So what's wrong with the tri caster?</v>

8586
04:07:41.580 --> 04:07:41.971
<v Speaker 12>So,</v>

8587
04:07:41.971 --> 04:07:42.570
<v Speaker 12>uh,</v>

8588
04:07:42.570 --> 04:07:44.420
<v Speaker 12>it says I'm running out of spaces.</v>

8589
04:07:44.490 --> 04:07:46.890
<v Speaker 12>There's less than two gigs of space left,</v>

8590
04:07:47.420 --> 04:07:51.480
<v Speaker 12>right on the tri caster and cause I record and stream at the same time just in</v>

8591
04:07:51.481 --> 04:07:52.410
<v Speaker 12>case something goes wrong.</v>

8592
04:07:52.500 --> 04:07:53.790
<v Speaker 12>So the recording is going to stop.</v>

8593
04:07:53.791 --> 04:07:55.150
<v Speaker 12>I don't know if the streets and stuff.</v>

8594
04:07:55.480 --> 04:07:56.170
<v Speaker 11>Hmm.</v>

8595
04:07:56.170 --> 04:07:57.610
<v Speaker 11>But you don't need that recording anyway,</v>

8596
04:07:57.611 --> 04:07:57.940
<v Speaker 11>right?</v>

8597
04:07:57.940 --> 04:07:58.301
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

8598
04:07:58.301 --> 04:08:00.670
<v Speaker 12>I don't know if it's going to shut the whole machine off or not though.</v>

8599
04:08:00.820 --> 04:08:01.390
<v Speaker 12>Oh,</v>

8600
04:08:01.390 --> 04:08:02.020
<v Speaker 12>I don't think it was.</v>

8601
04:08:02.020 --> 04:08:02.853
<v Speaker 12>That's not good.</v>

8602
04:08:03.530 --> 04:08:03.951
<v Speaker 12>All right.</v>

8603
04:08:03.951 --> 04:08:07.330
<v Speaker 12>We're good to do your best job in January was just getting ready in case</v>

8604
04:08:07.331 --> 04:08:08.164

8605
04:08:10.800 --> 04:08:11.633
<v Speaker 10>It's</v>

8606
04:08:12.560 --> 04:08:13.393

8607
04:08:18.450 --> 04:08:19.680
<v Speaker 11>We're not talking right now.</v>

8608
04:08:21.570 --> 04:08:22.880
<v Speaker 11>Israel has got,</v>

8609
04:08:22.890 --> 04:08:24.600
<v Speaker 11>is a nice cup there.</v>

8610
04:08:25.290 --> 04:08:26.070
<v Speaker 11>One his trophy.</v>

04:08:27.990 --> 04:08:28.380
<v Speaker 11>Okay.</v>

8613
04:08:28.380 --> 04:08:29.213
<v Speaker 11>Okay.</v>

8614
04:08:29.910 --> 04:08:30.421
<v Speaker 11>So yeah,</v>

8615
04:08:30.421 --> 04:08:30.870
<v Speaker 11>man,</v>

8616
04:08:30.870 --> 04:08:35.870
<v Speaker 11>the world population has gone up double in the u s population has gone up a</v>

8617
04:08:36.240 --> 04:08:38.790
<v Speaker 11>hundred million at one point in time.</v>

8618
04:08:39.270 --> 04:08:43.020
<v Speaker 11>If you think 1973 point 7 million and now more than 7 million,</v>

8619
04:08:44.130 --> 04:08:46.230
<v Speaker 11>what is that going to be 50 years from now?</v>

8620
04:08:46.470 --> 04:08:47.090
<v Speaker 11>No,</v>

8621
04:08:47.090 --> 04:08:48.180
<v Speaker 11>that's not going to be double.</v>

8622
04:08:48.210 --> 04:08:49.320
<v Speaker 11>It's going to be double again.</v>

8623
04:08:49.910 --> 04:08:51.210
<v Speaker 11>Is it 14 then?</v>

8624
04:08:51.270 --> 04:08:52.103
<v Speaker 11>What does that mean?</v>

8625
04:08:52.260 --> 04:08:54.060
<v Speaker 11>What's it like with the world?</v>

8626
04:08:54.120 --> 04:08:55.260
<v Speaker 11>So that's billions.</v>

8627
04:08:55.350 --> 04:08:55.570
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

8628
04:08:55.570 --> 04:08:58.740
<v Speaker 11>Look with a project by 2050 they projected 9 billion.</v>

8629
04:08:59.760 --> 04:09:00.031
<v Speaker 11>Yeah,</v>

8630
04:09:00.031 --> 04:09:01.200
<v Speaker 11>the world's billions.</v>

8631
04:09:01.640 --> 04:09:02.310
<v Speaker 11>It's interesting.</v>

8632
04:09:02.310 --> 04:09:07.310
<v Speaker 11>So between 1950 and 2050 in a hundred years it goes up 7 billion.</v>

8633
04:09:09.690 --> 04:09:10.523
<v Speaker 11>Good Lord.</v>

8634
04:09:11.340 --> 04:09:11.630
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

8635
04:09:11.630 --> 04:09:14.100
<v Speaker 12>There's a stat that says that the whole population could</v>

8636
04:09:14.100 --> 04:09:15.210
<v Speaker 11>like fit in Texas.</v>

8637
04:09:15.510 --> 04:09:17.570
<v Speaker 11>Have you ever heard that those people are assholes?</v>

8638
04:09:17.620 --> 04:09:18.020
<v Speaker 11>No.</v>

8639
04:09:18.020 --> 04:09:19.140
<v Speaker 11>Nobody says that as an asshole.</v>

8640
04:09:20.670 --> 04:09:22.440
<v Speaker 11>Spots in Texas that you can't live in.</v>

8641
04:09:22.530 --> 04:09:25.110
<v Speaker 11>There's just heela monsters and fucking cactuses and shit.</v>

8642
04:09:27.740 --> 04:09:28.860
<v Speaker 11>If you had the fucking,</v>

8643
04:09:29.130 --> 04:09:31.170
<v Speaker 11>all the population he tried to fit them in Texas,</v>

8644
04:09:31.171 --> 04:09:32.280
<v Speaker 11>they want of eating each other.</v>

8645
04:09:32.360 --> 04:09:34.080
<v Speaker 11>It'd be no food like,</v>

8646
04:09:34.170 --> 04:09:34.531
<v Speaker 11>yeah.</v>

8647
04:09:34.531 --> 04:09:34.801
<v Speaker 11>Yeah,</v>

8648
04:09:34.801 --> 04:09:36.570
<v Speaker 11>you could kind of fit them physically,</v>

8649
04:09:37.470 --> 04:09:39.900
<v Speaker 11>but like not like resource wise.</v>

8650
04:09:41.820 --> 04:09:43.290
<v Speaker 11>Texas is a good place to go though.</v>

8651
04:09:43.291 --> 04:09:45.390
<v Speaker 11>If the shit hits the fan and it was hot,</v>

8652
04:09:45.780 --> 04:09:46.470
<v Speaker 11>it's hot.</v>

8653
04:09:46.470 --> 04:09:50.460
<v Speaker 11>But there's a lot of people that have figured out how to be off the grid or</v>

8654
04:09:50.550 --> 04:09:52.290
<v Speaker 11>mostly off the grid there.</v>

8655
04:09:52.470 --> 04:09:54.690
<v Speaker 11>You'd get a thousand square feet per person.</v>

8656
04:09:54.780 --> 04:09:57.810
<v Speaker 11>If we got 6.9 billion people in Texas,</v>

8657
04:09:57.811 --> 04:10:00.630
<v Speaker 11>which there's still 500 million people left over,</v>

8658
04:10:01.350 --> 04:10:02.310
<v Speaker 11>so what does that mean?</v>

8659
04:10:02.480 --> 04:10:03.313
<v Speaker 11>That's just a,</v>

8660
04:10:03.430 --> 04:10:06.150
<v Speaker 11>you could get a thousand square foot apartment.</v>

8661
04:10:06.210 --> 04:10:06.481
<v Speaker 11>Yeah,</v>

8662
04:10:06.481 --> 04:10:08.030
<v Speaker 11>but that doesn't mean that even apartment,</v>

8663
04:10:08.040 --> 04:10:10.410
<v Speaker 11>I think it's like literal feet on the ground.</v>

8664
04:10:10.411 --> 04:10:10.890
<v Speaker 11>Like,</v>

8665
04:10:10.890 --> 04:10:11.251
<v Speaker 11>oh,</v>

8666
04:10:11.251 --> 04:10:12.084
<v Speaker 11>I see.</v>

8667
04:10:13.020 --> 04:10:15.300
<v Speaker 11>No way everyone can fit in Texas.</v>

8668
04:10:15.330 --> 04:10:15.750
<v Speaker 11>Okay.</v>

8669
04:10:15.750 --> 04:10:16.950
<v Speaker 11>So they wouldn't be able to,</v>

8670
04:10:17.640 --> 04:10:20.880
<v Speaker 11>so they like the physical size of the people would not be able to fit.</v>

8671
04:10:21.780 --> 04:10:22.980
<v Speaker 11>There's too many people to fit.</v>

8672
04:10:23.250 --> 04:10:26.580
<v Speaker 11>Like we would overwhelm the entire state if we just stood there.</v>

8673
04:10:26.640 --> 04:10:28.120
<v Speaker 11>And there's so many fat</v>

8674
04:10:29.940 --> 04:10:30.660
<v Speaker 11>people there too.</v>

8675
04:10:30.660 --> 04:10:32.690
<v Speaker 11>I was confused as to what you're saying of space.</v>

8676
04:10:32.760 --> 04:10:37.660
<v Speaker 11>The land mass of taxes is (260) 800-0820 square miles.</v>

8677
04:10:37.661 --> 04:10:41.430
<v Speaker 11>7,494,002 oh 7 billion.</v>

8678
04:10:41.580 --> 04:10:42.031
<v Speaker 11>What does that,</v>

8679
04:10:42.031 --> 04:10:42.781
<v Speaker 11>is that even billion?</v>

8680
04:10:42.781 --> 04:10:43.021
<v Speaker 11>No,</v>

8681
04:10:43.021 --> 04:10:43.830
<v Speaker 11>that's not billion.</v>

8682
04:10:43.830 --> 04:10:45.000
<v Speaker 11>What does that trillion,</v>

8683
04:10:45.240 --> 04:10:46.230
<v Speaker 11>7 trillion,</v>

8684
04:10:46.980 --> 04:10:50.280
<v Speaker 11>494 billion.</v>

8685
04:10:50.281 --> 04:10:51.810
<v Speaker 11>271 million.</v>

8686
04:10:51.811 --> 04:10:53.850
<v Speaker 11>488,000 square feet.</v>

8687
04:10:55.050 --> 04:10:55.883
<v Speaker 11>Whoa.</v>

8688
04:10:57.810 --> 04:10:58.643
<v Speaker 11>Interesting.</v>

8689
04:10:59.370 --> 04:11:02.340
<v Speaker 11>So no close but not,</v>

8690
04:11:02.580 --> 04:11:03.413
<v Speaker 11>not quiet.</v>

8691
04:11:04.500 --> 04:11:06.000
<v Speaker 11>That's a lot of fucking people,</v>

8692
04:11:06.001 --> 04:11:06.834
<v Speaker 11>man.</v>

8693
04:11:07.190 --> 04:11:08.580
<v Speaker 11>Got To feed all those folks.</v>

8694
04:11:09.150 --> 04:11:13.020
<v Speaker 11>They all need food and water and a place to shit.</v>

8695
04:11:14.100 --> 04:11:18.300
<v Speaker 11>You know he used the rest of the continental United States for funding.</v>

8696
04:11:18.990 --> 04:11:19.823
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

8697
04:11:19.890 --> 04:11:22.510
<v Speaker 11>So everybody's just standing and then they go out to the garden.</v>

8698
04:11:22.530 --> 04:11:23.770
<v Speaker 11>They come back and stand.</v>

8699
04:11:23.920 --> 04:11:25.470
<v Speaker 11>They go out and they shit.</v>

8700
04:11:25.471 --> 04:11:26.610
<v Speaker 11>And the whole of death.</v>

8701
04:11:27.120 --> 04:11:28.290
<v Speaker 11>I'm going to go back and stand.</v>

8702
04:11:28.410 --> 04:11:28.521
<v Speaker 11>It.</v>

8703
04:11:28.521 --> 04:11:29.261
<v Speaker 11>Just have like a,</v>

8704
04:11:29.261 --> 04:11:31.290
<v Speaker 11>a pipe that runs through.</v>

8705
04:11:31.500 --> 04:11:36.500
<v Speaker 11>Everybody has their all 7 billion plus shitting into this one tube.</v>

8706
04:11:37.730 --> 04:11:39.290
<v Speaker 11>Uh,</v>

8707
04:11:40.180 --> 04:11:42.780
<v Speaker 11>out of that attitude mixes with our</v>

8708
04:11:44.670 --> 04:11:46.310
<v Speaker 11>terrible pollution shit.</v>

8709
04:11:46.311 --> 04:11:47.250
<v Speaker 11>Monster was born,</v>

8710
04:11:48.060 --> 04:11:48.870
<v Speaker 11>crawls out,</v>

8711
04:11:48.870 --> 04:11:49.770
<v Speaker 11>kills us all.</v>

8712
04:11:50.580 --> 04:11:51.413
<v Speaker 11>That's a,</v>

8713
04:11:51.600 --> 04:11:53.200
<v Speaker 11>ironically that's what did end.</v>

8714
04:11:53.201 --> 04:11:53.521
<v Speaker 11>There you go.</v>

8715
04:11:53.521 --> 04:11:54.354
<v Speaker 11>It's on.</v>

8716
04:11:55.170 --> 04:11:59.520
<v Speaker 11>That's one of the things that did in a lot of civilizations is their hygiene.</v>

8717
04:12:00.050 --> 04:12:00.630
<v Speaker 11>You know,</v>

8718
04:12:00.630 --> 04:12:05.630
<v Speaker 11>a lot of civilizations had serious problems with their sewage,</v>

8719
04:12:06.570 --> 04:12:10.650
<v Speaker 11>like figuring out how to get their shit away from everything that's going on in</v>

8720
04:12:10.651 --> 04:12:11.260
<v Speaker 11>India,</v>

8721
04:12:11.260 --> 04:12:11.770
<v Speaker 11>isn't it?</v>

8722
04:12:11.770 --> 04:12:12.070
<v Speaker 11>I think</v>

8723
04:12:12.070 --> 04:12:12.281
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

8724
04:12:12.281 --> 04:12:13.114
<v Speaker 1>yeah</v>

8725
04:12:15.190 --> 04:12:15.521
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

8726
04:12:15.521 --> 04:12:19.390
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't imagine living in a place where you could probably,</v>

8727
04:12:19.391 --> 04:12:24.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean like is it like Mumbai or placed at cities like that when you're not in,</v>

8728
04:12:25.690 --> 04:12:27.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean I guess when you're out where,</v>

8729
04:12:27.101 --> 04:12:30.340
<v Speaker 1>where some of the poor people of that country or city live,</v>

8730
04:12:31.210 --> 04:12:34.870
<v Speaker 1>they don't have indoor plumbing or no,</v>

8731
04:12:34.871 --> 04:12:37.270
<v Speaker 1>there's people that are living in really poor for sure.</v>

8732
04:12:37.271 --> 04:12:38.710
<v Speaker 1>And that's just one part of the world,</v>

8733
04:12:38.711 --> 04:12:39.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

8734
04:12:39.310 --> 04:12:43.540
<v Speaker 1>I think it'd be pretty humbling if any of us ever went there and spent some time</v>

8735
04:12:43.541 --> 04:12:43.980
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

8736
04:12:43.980 --> 04:12:46.900
<v Speaker 1>So I was thinking about this the other day when I saw,</v>

8737
04:12:46.960 --> 04:12:49.630
<v Speaker 1>I saw some some relief aid going to Haiti,</v>

8738
04:12:49.990 --> 04:12:50.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

8739
04:12:50.470 --> 04:12:51.190
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

8740
04:12:51.190 --> 04:12:52.023
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

8741
04:12:52.990 --> 04:12:54.700
<v Speaker 1>something bad just happened there.</v>

8742
04:12:54.910 --> 04:12:55.743
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

8743
04:12:57.090 --> 04:13:01.180
<v Speaker 1>there are places that are in that same situation without something bad happening</v>

8744
04:13:01.181 --> 04:13:02.890
<v Speaker 1>and there isn't really no aid going to them.</v>

8745
04:13:02.891 --> 04:13:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Like is it only a good good thing to help people when,</v>

8746
04:13:06.220 --> 04:13:06.881
<v Speaker 1>when an ad,</v>

8747
04:13:06.881 --> 04:13:08.020
<v Speaker 1>a tragedy happens?</v>

8748
04:13:08.050 --> 04:13:08.291
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

8749
04:13:08.291 --> 04:13:08.501
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

8750
04:13:08.501 --> 04:13:10.890
<v Speaker 1>if the capability is still there too.</v>

8751
04:13:10.900 --> 04:13:11.733
<v Speaker 1>Good point.</v>

8752
04:13:11.920 --> 04:13:12.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a really good point.</v>

8753
04:13:13.860 --> 04:13:14.710
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good point.</v>

8754
04:13:15.220 --> 04:13:15.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8755
04:13:15.490 --> 04:13:19.420
<v Speaker 1>It seems like people wait until everything goes terrible for this step in to</v>

8756
04:13:19.421 --> 04:13:21.280
<v Speaker 1>help with those people.</v>

8757
04:13:21.281 --> 04:13:21.701
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

8758
04:13:21.701 --> 04:13:24.190
<v Speaker 1>they were still suffering from a hurricane a couple of years ago.</v>

8759
04:13:24.850 --> 04:13:25.683
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8760
04:13:26.320 --> 04:13:27.153
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

8761
04:13:28.840 --> 04:13:32.230
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like we're getting close to the point where,</v>

8762
04:13:32.740 --> 04:13:32.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8763
04:13:32.950 --> 04:13:35.230
<v Speaker 1>when you see all these go fund me's and all these,</v>

8764
04:13:35.231 --> 04:13:35.501
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8765
04:13:35.501 --> 04:13:35.890
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

8766
04:13:35.890 --> 04:13:37.090
<v Speaker 1>these campaigns like that,</v>

8767
04:13:37.840 --> 04:13:42.840
<v Speaker 1>it seems like if someone had figured out a way to attach a purchasing app like</v>

8768
04:13:45.520 --> 04:13:50.520
<v Speaker 1>amazon.com or something like that and attach an option to donate to specific</v>

8769
04:13:52.691 --> 04:13:53.380
<v Speaker 1>charities,</v>

8770
04:13:53.380 --> 04:13:56.020
<v Speaker 1>like you could set that up and they would just rounded off.</v>

8771
04:13:56.230 --> 04:13:58.570
<v Speaker 1>Like say if you're buying something that's $3 and 50 cents,</v>

8772
04:13:58.571 --> 04:14:01.510
<v Speaker 1>I rounded off to $4 and just do that with everybody.</v>

8773
04:14:01.990 --> 04:14:04.030
<v Speaker 1>And no matter what it would be,</v>

8774
04:14:04.031 --> 04:14:06.970
<v Speaker 1>it would round up to the next dollar.</v>

8775
04:14:07.300 --> 04:14:10.120
<v Speaker 1>And you just take all that money from all these purchases.</v>

8776
04:14:10.150 --> 04:14:14.110
<v Speaker 1>When thinking about how many millions of dollars a day must be generated by a</v>

8777
04:14:14.111 --> 04:14:19.111
<v Speaker 1>purchasing APP like amazon.com and if you just rounded off to the next dollar</v>

8778
04:14:19.210 --> 04:14:20.740
<v Speaker 1>and donated all that money,</v>

8779
04:14:21.100 --> 04:14:23.860
<v Speaker 1>think about how much crazy shit could get done.</v>

8780
04:14:24.610 --> 04:14:25.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

8781
04:14:25.120 --> 04:14:26.800
<v Speaker 1>the sheer amount of,</v>

8782
04:14:26.801 --> 04:14:28.060
<v Speaker 1>if everybody agreed to do that,</v>

8783
04:14:28.061 --> 04:14:28.211
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

8784
04:14:28.211 --> 04:14:29.350
<v Speaker 1>everybody hates penny's.</v>

8785
04:14:29.530 --> 04:14:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Nichols.</v>

8786
04:14:30.670 --> 04:14:32.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't like Nichols and none in the dimes.</v>

8787
04:14:32.321 --> 04:14:32.870
<v Speaker 1>I though those are,</v>

8788
04:14:32.870 --> 04:14:33.611
<v Speaker 1>they're annoying.</v>

8789
04:14:33.611 --> 04:14:34.870
<v Speaker 1>They click around in your pocket,</v>

8790
04:14:34.871 --> 04:14:36.580
<v Speaker 1>you can't really buy shit with them.</v>

8791
04:14:36.820 --> 04:14:37.653
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

8792
04:14:38.220 --> 04:14:39.640
<v Speaker 1>It rounded off,</v>

8793
04:14:40.030 --> 04:14:40.960
<v Speaker 1>round it all off,</v>

8794
04:14:40.990 --> 04:14:41.830
<v Speaker 1>round everything off.</v>

8795
04:14:41.831 --> 04:14:44.080
<v Speaker 1>If we all just agreed as a society,</v>

8796
04:14:44.320 --> 04:14:46.000
<v Speaker 1>then when no matter what the money is,</v>

8797
04:14:46.510 --> 04:14:51.510
<v Speaker 1>it's $4 and 64 cents around that bitch off to five bucks and that money goes</v>

8798
04:14:51.551 --> 04:14:54.160
<v Speaker 1>into the be a good human pool.</v>

8799
04:14:55.510 --> 04:14:57.310
<v Speaker 1>How many orders does Amazon get per day?</v>

8800
04:14:57.580 --> 04:15:00.430
<v Speaker 1>36.8 million items.</v>

8801
04:15:02.150 --> 04:15:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

8802
04:15:02.500 --> 04:15:03.101
<v Speaker 1>but there isn't,</v>

8803
04:15:03.101 --> 04:15:05.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are some people that uh,</v>

8804
04:15:05.120 --> 04:15:10.120
<v Speaker 1>that or if they're thing costs $3 and 17 cents,</v>

8805
04:15:11.540 --> 04:15:16.140
<v Speaker 11>that 87 that 83 cents means a lot to them and they don't want to give it a go.</v>

8806
04:15:16.810 --> 04:15:17.541
<v Speaker 11>They've got to wake up,</v>

8807
04:15:17.541 --> 04:15:18.470
<v Speaker 11>we're all in this together.</v>

8808
04:15:18.680 --> 04:15:20.480
<v Speaker 11>If you can afford to buy that new toothbrush,</v>

8809
04:15:20.570 --> 04:15:22.790
<v Speaker 11>electric toothbrush with the Darth Vader sound,</v>

8810
04:15:23.530 --> 04:15:26.810
<v Speaker 11>you could afford to give that extra 30 cents to those kids in Bangladesh.</v>

8811
04:15:27.680 --> 04:15:29.480
<v Speaker 11>It's only we're talking pennies here.</v>

8812
04:15:29.550 --> 04:15:30.770
<v Speaker 11>We're literally talking sense.</v>

8813
04:15:30.771 --> 04:15:33.290
<v Speaker 11>I don't think they'll sense do mean a lot to the individual,</v>

8814
04:15:33.380 --> 04:15:34.940
<v Speaker 11>but I think they mean a lot collectively.</v>

8815
04:15:34.941 --> 04:15:37.670
<v Speaker 11>I think when you're looking at millions of orders,</v>

8816
04:15:38.030 --> 04:15:40.550
<v Speaker 11>that could be an insane force of good.</v>

8817
04:15:40.551 --> 04:15:40.931
<v Speaker 11>Like if,</v>

8818
04:15:40.931 --> 04:15:43.790
<v Speaker 11>if Amazon wanted to get people to love them again,</v>

8819
04:15:44.450 --> 04:15:45.890
<v Speaker 11>cause sometimes people like to hear about it.</v>

8820
04:15:45.891 --> 04:15:48.440
<v Speaker 11>Like the people that work at Amazon apparently is like,</v>

8821
04:15:48.560 --> 04:15:49.460
<v Speaker 11>it's insane.</v>

8822
04:15:49.520 --> 04:15:51.050
<v Speaker 11>Like if you're working in the factory,</v>

8823
04:15:51.290 --> 04:15:53.960
<v Speaker 11>you've got like a timer that goes off when someone's,</v>

8824
04:15:54.080 --> 04:15:55.310
<v Speaker 11>when someone's order gets placed.</v>

8825
04:15:55.310 --> 04:15:56.390
<v Speaker 11>Do you have like a clipboard,</v>

8826
04:15:56.570 --> 04:15:59.570
<v Speaker 11>like one of those iPad things and there's like some sort of a timer on it and</v>

8827
04:15:59.571 --> 04:16:03.320
<v Speaker 11>you've got to run to where the item is and get it and get it in a box quickly.</v>

8828
04:16:03.321 --> 04:16:04.154
<v Speaker 11>Like it's,</v>

8829
04:16:04.230 --> 04:16:06.590
<v Speaker 11>it's like super tight ship.</v>

8830
04:16:06.591 --> 04:16:07.460
<v Speaker 11>They run over there,</v>

8831
04:16:08.960 --> 04:16:10.130
<v Speaker 11>they get everybody to love him again.</v>

8832
04:16:10.690 --> 04:16:14.240
<v Speaker 11>It sounds like something you'd see that a company like that would have</v>

8833
04:16:14.270 --> 04:16:15.103
<v Speaker 11>automated.</v>

8834
04:16:15.350 --> 04:16:20.350
<v Speaker 11>So like somebody places and no one in it is the robot goes and grabs it and no,</v>

8835
04:16:20.960 --> 04:16:21.141
<v Speaker 11>no.</v>

8836
04:16:21.141 --> 04:16:22.250
<v Speaker 11>You've got to go get stuff.</v>

8837
04:16:22.650 --> 04:16:23.570
<v Speaker 11>Does people have written,</v>

8838
04:16:23.600 --> 04:16:25.040
<v Speaker 11>I mean maybe some of it's automated,</v>

8839
04:16:25.310 --> 04:16:26.143
<v Speaker 11>but I know that people</v>

04:19:28.480 --> 04:19:28.871
<v Speaker 11>Where,</v>

8960
04:19:28.871 --> 04:19:29.704
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>

8961
04:19:30.030 --> 04:19:30.611
<v Speaker 11>we were,</v>

8962
04:19:30.611 --> 04:19:31.150
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>

8963
04:19:31.150 --> 04:19:32.560
<v Speaker 11>going over that one podcast,</v>

8964
04:19:32.561 --> 04:19:36.850
<v Speaker 11>we're trying to figure out how much of your actual donation goes to the charity</v>

8965
04:19:36.851 --> 04:19:40.960
<v Speaker 11>and how much goes to fees and the people that work,</v>

8966
04:19:40.961 --> 04:19:45.330
<v Speaker 11>they're getting paid and the rent and all the overhead,</v>

8967
04:19:45.390 --> 04:19:46.223
<v Speaker 11>all the overhead.</v>

8968
04:19:46.930 --> 04:19:47.830
<v Speaker 11>It's not a lot.</v>

8969
04:19:48.580 --> 04:19:52.000
<v Speaker 11>It's like there's a business of charity and the people that work for those</v>

8970
04:19:52.001 --> 04:19:52.391
<v Speaker 11>charities,</v>

8971
04:19:52.391 --> 04:19:53.224
<v Speaker 11>they get paid well,</v>

8972
04:19:53.380 --> 04:19:53.620
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

8973
04:19:53.620 --> 04:19:54.930
<v Speaker 11>and they should keep out.</v>

8974
04:19:55.020 --> 04:19:55.853
<v Speaker 11>Is it</v>

8975
04:19:56.480 --> 04:19:57.313
<v Speaker 10>big dude?</v>

8976
04:19:57.640 --> 04:19:58.473
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

8977
04:19:59.840 --> 04:20:00.490
<v Speaker 11>Growing heart.</v>

8978
04:20:00.490 --> 04:20:01.610
<v Speaker 11>Just tag Nikki holes.</v>

8979
04:20:01.611 --> 04:20:02.990
<v Speaker 11>Come with a couple of good shots.</v>

8980
04:20:04.130 --> 04:20:04.510
<v Speaker 11>Oh,</v>

8981
04:20:04.510 --> 04:20:05.343
<v Speaker 11>Ooh,</v>

8982
04:20:05.700 --> 04:20:05.890
<v Speaker 10>good.</v>

8983
04:20:05.890 --> 04:20:06.241
<v Speaker 10>Back Up.</v>

8984
04:20:06.241 --> 04:20:07.650
<v Speaker 10>Now we're back up.</v>

8985
04:20:12.060 --> 04:20:12.920
<v Speaker 10>Ooh.</v>

8986
04:20:13.260 --> 04:20:16.410
<v Speaker 11>See this to me is so much more interesting than boxing.</v>

8987
04:20:16.950 --> 04:20:18.120
<v Speaker 11>The way these guys are switched,</v>

8988
04:20:18.121 --> 04:20:20.040
<v Speaker 11>kicking each other and fucking each other with this.</v>

8989
04:20:20.160 --> 04:20:23.100
<v Speaker 11>Like this is like really technical striking all around,</v>

8990
04:20:23.130 --> 04:20:24.180
<v Speaker 11>up and down.</v>

8991
04:20:25.610 --> 04:20:27.110
<v Speaker 11>Like when you get to this level.</v>

8992
04:20:27.740 --> 04:20:28.670
<v Speaker 11>This to me is like,</v>

8993
04:20:28.671 --> 04:20:30.200
<v Speaker 11>there's so much more going on</v>

8994
04:20:32.980 --> 04:20:36.160
<v Speaker 11>and it's so much more likely to have something going on.</v>

8995
04:20:36.310 --> 04:20:37.690
<v Speaker 11>Then it was just boxing.</v>

8996
04:20:38.380 --> 04:20:38.790
<v Speaker 11>You know?</v>

8997
04:20:38.790 --> 04:20:40.630
<v Speaker 11>There's just way more boring rounds,</v>

8998
04:20:40.900 --> 04:20:41.531
<v Speaker 11>in my opinion.</v>

8999
04:20:41.531 --> 04:20:44.170
<v Speaker 11>At least inboxing and there isn't high level kickboxing.</v>

9000
04:20:47.810 --> 04:20:51.290
<v Speaker 10>We backup Jamie back up eve Edwards.</v>

9001
04:20:51.500 --> 04:20:52.333
<v Speaker 10>Awesome.</v>

9002
04:20:53.810 --> 04:20:54.950
<v Speaker 11>That's what he had him in trouble.</v>

9003
04:20:55.010 --> 04:20:55.700
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

9004
04:20:55.700 --> 04:20:55.851
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

9005
04:20:55.851 --> 04:20:56.684
<v Speaker 11>He tagged him.</v>

9006
04:20:56.900 --> 04:20:57.350
<v Speaker 11>He hit him.</v>

9007
04:20:57.350 --> 04:20:58.190
<v Speaker 11>He hit him there again.</v>

9008
04:20:58.460 --> 04:21:02.600
<v Speaker 11>He hit him a couple times really hard and you could see a host can taking some</v>

9009
04:21:02.601 --> 04:21:03.590
<v Speaker 11>big deep breaths.</v>

9010
04:21:05.950 --> 04:21:06.110
<v Speaker 10>It's</v>

9011
04:21:06.110 --> 04:21:08.140
<v Speaker 11>quite a little exchange there.</v>

9012
04:21:10.380 --> 04:21:11.460
<v Speaker 11>This guy is a savage.</v>

9013
04:21:12.660 --> 04:21:13.710
<v Speaker 11>How do you say Mike Pesan.</v>

9014
04:21:13.711 --> 04:21:14.130
<v Speaker 11>Yay.</v>

9015
04:21:14.130 --> 04:21:15.090
<v Speaker 11>How do you say his last name,</v>

9016
04:21:16.140 --> 04:21:16.351
<v Speaker 11>sir?</v>

9017
04:21:16.351 --> 04:21:19.350
<v Speaker 11>All of these tough things like Mike,</v>

9018
04:21:19.351 --> 04:21:21.780
<v Speaker 11>Passenger rear passengers and year</v>

9019
04:21:23.340 --> 04:21:23.611
<v Speaker 11>boy.</v>

9020
04:21:23.611 --> 04:21:25.230
<v Speaker 11>That guy trained a bunch of savages.</v>

9021
04:21:25.470 --> 04:21:26.303
<v Speaker 11>Oh yeah,</v>

9022
04:21:27.000 --> 04:21:27.740
<v Speaker 11>like I used to.</v>

9023
04:21:27.740 --> 04:21:27.991
<v Speaker 11>I don't,</v>

9024
04:21:27.991 --> 04:21:28.351
<v Speaker 11>I don't,</v>

9025
04:21:28.351 --> 04:21:29.184
<v Speaker 11>I don't actually,</v>

9026
04:21:29.370 --> 04:21:32.040
<v Speaker 11>it's weird how he used to bring my Melvin out.</v>

9027
04:21:32.520 --> 04:21:32.971
<v Speaker 11>Yeah,</v>

9028
04:21:32.971 --> 04:21:33.271
<v Speaker 11>Dude.</v>

9029
04:21:33.271 --> 04:21:34.081
<v Speaker 11>Like on a chain,</v>

9030
04:21:34.081 --> 04:21:34.950
<v Speaker 11>like a dog.</v>

9031
04:21:34.980 --> 04:21:36.780
<v Speaker 11>I remember that Melvin,</v>

9032
04:21:37.360 --> 04:21:38.640
<v Speaker 11>and I think that was his idea.</v>

9033
04:21:38.880 --> 04:21:39.361
<v Speaker 11>Oh yeah,</v>

9034
04:21:39.361 --> 04:21:44.361
<v Speaker 11>he was getting unchained do Melvin was crazy back in the day.</v>

9035
04:21:46.230 --> 04:21:50.640
<v Speaker 11>I mean you talk about a guy who live by the sword die by the sword.</v>

9036
04:21:51.840 --> 04:21:53.540
<v Speaker 11>He likes started the whole Gloria,</v>

9037
04:21:53.580 --> 04:21:56.850
<v Speaker 11>Gloria or gladiator a shorts thing.</v>

9038
04:21:57.030 --> 04:21:57.690
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

9039
04:21:57.690 --> 04:21:58.190
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

9040
04:21:58.190 --> 04:21:59.023
<v Speaker 11>Everybody does that.</v>

9041
04:21:59.040 --> 04:22:02.190
<v Speaker 11>Not every chick has that every check.</v>

9042
04:22:02.730 --> 04:22:07.380
<v Speaker 11>Well why is it that so many Thai shorts bind up on the legs?</v>

9043
04:22:08.100 --> 04:22:11.130
<v Speaker 11>Like you always see Thai guys like roll in their pants up,</v>

9044
04:22:11.160 --> 04:22:12.180
<v Speaker 11>roll in their shorts up.</v>

9045
04:22:12.240 --> 04:22:16.080
<v Speaker 11>I think that happens more so like that's like their thing.</v>

9046
04:22:16.081 --> 04:22:20.730
<v Speaker 11>Cause in Thailand it's like 180 degrees usually have like these really cheap</v>

9047
04:22:20.731 --> 04:22:21.541
<v Speaker 11>like the old ties,</v>

9048
04:22:21.541 --> 04:22:26.541
<v Speaker 11>my nylon shorts until it becomes your habit like your take when you're pulling</v>

9049
04:22:26.551 --> 04:22:27.780
<v Speaker 11>your pants up like that all the time.</v>

9050
04:22:27.830 --> 04:22:28.620
<v Speaker 11>Oh I see.</v>

9051
04:22:28.620 --> 04:22:31.740
<v Speaker 11>But it's also like insanely hot and humid over there</v>

9052
04:22:33.260 --> 04:22:38.160
<v Speaker 11>and then that kind of becomes like your style is to pull your pant leg up or</v>

9053
04:22:38.161 --> 04:22:38.994
<v Speaker 11>whatever.</v>

9054
04:22:40.710 --> 04:22:41.970
<v Speaker 11>It just seems to me like,</v>

9055
04:22:42.180 --> 04:22:43.560
<v Speaker 11>particularly for MMA,</v>

9056
04:22:43.590 --> 04:22:45.690
<v Speaker 11>there's no benefit in wearing shorts.</v>

9057
04:22:46.170 --> 04:22:50.820
<v Speaker 11>I feel like tights give you way more benefit because no one's grabbing them.</v>

9058
04:22:51.060 --> 04:22:54.600
<v Speaker 11>Like there are moments in fights were dudes get their shorts grabbed and those</v>

9059
04:22:54.601 --> 04:22:57.840
<v Speaker 11>moments they pay off for the guy who grabbed the shorts.</v>

9060
04:22:58.050 --> 04:22:58.950
<v Speaker 11>It's happened before.</v>

9061
04:22:59.280 --> 04:23:01.870
<v Speaker 11>Guys have gotten takedowns they've defended takedowns to,</v>

9062
04:23:01.871 --> 04:23:04.770
<v Speaker 11>they maybe wouldn't have if it wasn't for a short grab.</v>

9063
04:23:05.190 --> 04:23:08.820
<v Speaker 11>They've controlled positions for brief moments with a short grab and then the</v>

9064
04:23:08.821 --> 04:23:10.920
<v Speaker 11>referee didn't see it or the referee did see it and it said,</v>

9065
04:23:10.921 --> 04:23:11.940
<v Speaker 11>stop grabbing the shorts.</v>

9066
04:23:12.090 --> 04:23:13.170
<v Speaker 11>But they had already did it.</v>

9067
04:23:13.710 --> 04:23:15.570
<v Speaker 11>All that can be eliminated with tights.</v>

9068
04:23:15.780 --> 04:23:18.630
<v Speaker 11>But then if you wearing tight and you get caught in a Komora,</v>

9069
04:23:18.631 --> 04:23:20.010
<v Speaker 11>how do you grab your own shorts?</v>

9070
04:23:20.190 --> 04:23:21.023
<v Speaker 11>You don't,</v>

9071
04:23:21.440 --> 04:23:22.770
<v Speaker 11>you don't go get continent.</v>

9072
04:23:22.771 --> 04:23:23.720
<v Speaker 11>Comodo don't get caught it.</v>

9073
04:23:24.320 --> 04:23:29.190
<v Speaker 11>He grabbed your Dick just reached out and fully latch on.</v>

9074
04:23:29.450 --> 04:23:32.160
<v Speaker 11>It's still your cup and it's Myrtle,</v>

9075
04:23:32.280 --> 04:23:32.761
<v Speaker 11>myrtle.</v>

9076
04:23:32.761 --> 04:23:33.870
<v Speaker 11>Leave Mercato on,</v>

9077
04:23:33.940 --> 04:23:34.773
<v Speaker 11>on her.</v>

9078
04:23:37.400 --> 04:23:37.790
<v Speaker 11>Um,</v>

9079
04:23:37.790 --> 04:23:38.060
<v Speaker 11>that's,</v>

9080
04:23:38.060 --> 04:23:40.130
<v Speaker 11>that's the only time we're shorts would help you though.</v>

9081
04:23:40.131 --> 04:23:40.880
<v Speaker 11>You were right.</v>

9082
04:23:40.880 --> 04:23:42.020
<v Speaker 11>Grabbing your arm to defend a,</v>

9083
04:23:42.140 --> 04:23:43.970
<v Speaker 11>or grabbing your pants to defend a Komora.</v>

9084
04:23:44.330 --> 04:23:47.060
<v Speaker 11>What's kind of weird that you can do that you can grab your own choice.</v>

9085
04:23:47.090 --> 04:23:47.361
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

9086
04:23:47.361 --> 04:23:48.230
<v Speaker 11>What the fuck is that?</v>

9087
04:23:48.260 --> 04:23:50.060
<v Speaker 11>You can grab your own church to defend yourself.</v>

9088
04:23:50.090 --> 04:23:50.570
<v Speaker 11>Yeah,</v>

9089
04:23:50.570 --> 04:23:51.351
<v Speaker 11>that seems weird,</v>

9090
04:23:51.351 --> 04:23:52.184
<v Speaker 11>doesn't it?</v>

9091
04:23:52.280 --> 04:23:52.820
<v Speaker 11>Nope.</v>

9092
04:23:52.820 --> 04:23:55.070
<v Speaker 11>I don't think she should be able to grab your shorts to choke a guy.</v>

9093
04:23:55.310 --> 04:23:58.220
<v Speaker 11>Like if you wrap your leg around the guy's neck,</v>

9094
04:23:58.430 --> 04:23:58.850
<v Speaker 11>right.</v>

9095
04:23:58.850 --> 04:24:03.040
<v Speaker 11>And then you reach behind like the back of his head and you almost like a Zeke,</v>

9096
04:24:03.060 --> 04:24:04.160
<v Speaker 11>you'll choke</v>

9097
04:24:04.160 --> 04:24:06.950
<v Speaker 1>your own pants and choke them with your own shorts.</v>

9098
04:24:07.190 --> 04:24:08.720
<v Speaker 1>Can you do that?</v>

9099
04:24:08.810 --> 04:24:09.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

9100
04:24:09.260 --> 04:24:11.000
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine the position,</v>

9101
04:24:11.001 --> 04:24:11.870
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>

9102
04:24:14.590 --> 04:24:16.760
<v Speaker 1>It seems like somebody should have come up with that already.</v>

9103
04:24:17.150 --> 04:24:18.770
<v Speaker 1>I just go and see how you get your arm,</v>

9104
04:24:18.830 --> 04:24:19.663
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

9105
04:24:20.150 --> 04:24:21.230
<v Speaker 1>Well this is what I'm saying.</v>

9106
04:24:21.260 --> 04:24:23.690
<v Speaker 1>If somehow or another you had like your leg,</v>

9107
04:24:23.970 --> 04:24:25.040
<v Speaker 1>like your thigh,</v>

9108
04:24:25.070 --> 04:24:29.270
<v Speaker 1>like right here over the guy's neck and you went behind his head and you grabbed</v>

9109
04:24:29.271 --> 04:24:31.820
<v Speaker 1>a hold of your shorts and he just straighten your leg out.</v>

9110
04:24:31.821 --> 04:24:32.780
<v Speaker 1>You're choking that guy out.</v>

9111
04:24:32.781 --> 04:24:34.070
<v Speaker 1>What does and what your own shorts.</v>

9112
04:24:34.760 --> 04:24:38.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like an Ezekiel choke like one of those old school judo style.</v>

9113
04:24:38.070 --> 04:24:40.280
<v Speaker 1>Zeke you'll chokes with the collar.</v>

9114
04:24:40.310 --> 04:24:41.600
<v Speaker 1>I bet you it's legal.</v>

9115
04:24:42.890 --> 04:24:43.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9116
04:24:43.400 --> 04:24:48.400
<v Speaker 1>I know one thing I've seen dudes do is they finished chokes by holding onto</v>

9117
04:24:48.561 --> 04:24:49.460
<v Speaker 1>their own gloves.</v>

9118
04:24:49.490 --> 04:24:49.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

9119
04:24:49.880 --> 04:24:52.040
<v Speaker 1>Like they've got ahold of a choke and they're,</v>

9120
04:24:52.070 --> 04:24:52.690
<v Speaker 1>they're literally,</v>

9121
04:24:52.690 --> 04:24:56.840
<v Speaker 1>they've got a handle like underneath where your tape is and you can cinch up a</v>

9122
04:24:56.841 --> 04:24:58.070
<v Speaker 1>choke with that handle.</v>

9123
04:24:58.071 --> 04:24:58.840
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

9124
04:24:58.840 --> 04:25:00.110
<v Speaker 1>it's very effective.</v>

9125
04:25:00.111 --> 04:25:01.730
<v Speaker 1>Is illegal because it's your own hand.</v>

9126
04:25:01.790 --> 04:25:03.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's legal still.</v>

9127
04:25:03.470 --> 04:25:03.831
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

9128
04:25:03.831 --> 04:25:04.221
<v Speaker 1>It's legal.</v>

9129
04:25:04.221 --> 04:25:05.630
<v Speaker 1>Now I should know at Slu.</v>

9130
04:25:05.660 --> 04:25:06.493
<v Speaker 1>I should know this.</v>

9131
04:25:06.860 --> 04:25:07.630
<v Speaker 1>I should know this.</v>

9132
04:25:07.630 --> 04:25:08.110
<v Speaker 1>It's fine.</v>

9133
04:25:08.110 --> 04:25:09.810
<v Speaker 1>Every neuron JBC is,</v>

9134
04:25:09.830 --> 04:25:14.780
<v Speaker 1>is it legal to choke someone in MMA while holding onto your own glove?</v>

9135
04:25:14.930 --> 04:25:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Cause you definitely hold your glove if you're doing a gay teen,</v>

9136
04:25:18.050 --> 04:25:22.640
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of guys do a good teen like this and they clamp down on the glove and</v>

9137
04:25:22.641 --> 04:25:23.331
<v Speaker 1>they do it this way.</v>

9138
04:25:23.331 --> 04:25:27.440
<v Speaker 1>But I think the issue is in grabbing inside your glove cause then it's like</v>

9139
04:25:27.560 --> 04:25:29.390
<v Speaker 1>you've got a leather handle.</v>

9140
04:25:29.650 --> 04:25:29.781
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

9141
04:25:29.781 --> 04:25:31.490
<v Speaker 1>if you can get all your fingers in there.</v>

9142
04:25:31.540 --> 04:25:32.373
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

9143
04:25:32.480 --> 04:25:33.740
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good grip.</v>

9144
04:25:33.920 --> 04:25:35.040
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

9145
04:25:35.090 --> 04:25:37.040
<v Speaker 1>but I still don't see why it wouldn't be legal.</v>

9146
04:25:37.190 --> 04:25:38.690
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could get your fingers in here.</v>

9147
04:25:38.750 --> 04:25:39.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

9148
04:25:39.380 --> 04:25:40.490
<v Speaker 1>you could for sure.</v>

9149
04:25:40.491 --> 04:25:42.650
<v Speaker 1>You can get your fingers in it that way and they wouldn't even be able to see</v>

9150
04:25:42.651 --> 04:25:42.830
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

9151
04:25:42.830 --> 04:25:43.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

9152
04:25:43.340 --> 04:25:44.173
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

9153
04:25:44.960 --> 04:25:45.291
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

9154
04:25:45.291 --> 04:25:46.490
<v Speaker 1>You could have the top of your hand.</v>

9155
04:25:47.690 --> 04:25:48.860
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting argument,</v>

9156
04:25:49.580 --> 04:25:49.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9157
04:25:49.971 --> 04:25:52.010
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think you should be able to grab clothes,</v>

9158
04:25:52.011 --> 04:25:52.580
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

9159
04:25:52.580 --> 04:25:54.440
<v Speaker 1>Like anybody you,</v>

9160
04:25:54.740 --> 04:25:55.520
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

9161
04:25:55.520 --> 04:25:56.450
<v Speaker 1>no one grabs close.</v>

9162
04:25:56.690 --> 04:25:57.530
<v Speaker 1>Don't be grabbing clothes.</v>

9163
04:25:57.531 --> 04:25:58.520
<v Speaker 1>That'd be good to have him call his bro.</v>

9164
04:25:58.550 --> 04:25:59.480
<v Speaker 1>No clothes for.</v>

9165
04:25:59.630 --> 04:26:00.860
<v Speaker 1>We'll let them fight with a Gian.</v>

9166
04:26:02.640 --> 04:26:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Keep grabbing clothes and everyone's gonna be fighting tights.</v>

9167
04:26:05.510 --> 04:26:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

9168
04:26:05.810 --> 04:26:10.810
<v Speaker 1>it was awesome back in the day to see boys crazy with a fucking g on go in there</v>

9169
04:26:11.691 --> 04:26:13.010
<v Speaker 1>and just rap guys up.</v>

9170
04:26:13.190 --> 04:26:14.780
<v Speaker 1>Drag him down and strangle them.</v>

9171
04:26:15.350 --> 04:26:17.030
<v Speaker 1>No denying it was awesome.</v>

9172
04:26:17.690 --> 04:26:18.530
<v Speaker 1>It was different,</v>

9173
04:26:18.560 --> 04:26:19.280
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

9174
04:26:19.280 --> 04:26:19.851
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>

9175
04:26:19.851 --> 04:26:20.684
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

9176
04:26:21.110 --> 04:26:24.260
<v Speaker 1>I liked that because back then I was doing traditional Kung Fu.</v>

9177
04:26:24.261 --> 04:26:28.050
<v Speaker 1>So the first guy I wanted to see when was Jason Dilution.</v>

9178
04:26:28.250 --> 04:26:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah man.</v>

9179
04:26:29.570 --> 04:26:33.140
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see the street fight that they had in the Gracie Dojo war series</v>

9180
04:26:33.470 --> 04:26:34.780
<v Speaker 1>with dilution and hoists?</v>

9181
04:26:34.800 --> 04:26:36.020
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I saw that.</v>

9182
04:26:36.190 --> 04:26:37.023
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

9183
04:26:37.040 --> 04:26:40.520
<v Speaker 1>Once is grainy old VHS copy.</v>

9184
04:26:40.940 --> 04:26:41.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

9185
04:26:41.600 --> 04:26:42.433
<v Speaker 1>Dilu shows,</v>

9186
04:26:42.440 --> 04:26:42.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9187
04:26:42.890 --> 04:26:43.940
<v Speaker 1>he knew how to fight.</v>

9188
04:26:43.970 --> 04:26:47.030
<v Speaker 1>He just didn't know how to defend against Jujitsu and hoist.</v>

9189
04:26:47.240 --> 04:26:48.073
<v Speaker 1>Mangled them.</v>

9190
04:26:48.530 --> 04:26:51.800
<v Speaker 1>But then that was before the UFC was it up and then they fought in the UFC and</v>

9191
04:26:51.801 --> 04:26:52.850
<v Speaker 1>then hoists arm barred him.</v>

9192
04:26:53.470 --> 04:26:58.470
<v Speaker 1>So he said already fought him in a Dojo war first and just do not just</v>

9193
04:26:58.791 --> 04:26:59.624
<v Speaker 1>demolished him.</v>

9194
04:26:59.750 --> 04:27:01.040
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the Dojo storms</v>

9195
04:27:02.040 --> 04:27:02.873
<v Speaker 11>too?</v>

9196
04:27:03.480 --> 04:27:04.650
<v Speaker 11>Those are all real.</v>

9197
04:27:04.680 --> 04:27:05.610
<v Speaker 11>Those happened.</v>

9198
04:27:06.030 --> 04:27:07.200
<v Speaker 11>Did you ever take part in Daddy?</v>

9199
04:27:07.470 --> 04:27:09.120
<v Speaker 11>I didn't take part in the Dojo storm.</v>

9200
04:27:09.150 --> 04:27:13.380
<v Speaker 11>I took part in having to deal with guys that came over from other schools that</v>

9201
04:27:13.381 --> 04:27:15.240
<v Speaker 11>wanted it to like test themselves.</v>

9202
04:27:15.241 --> 04:27:16.200
<v Speaker 11>Like in most of them were,</v>

9203
04:27:16.290 --> 04:27:16.891
<v Speaker 11>there was a lot of them.</v>

9204
04:27:16.891 --> 04:27:18.450
<v Speaker 11>They're just delusional and crazy.</v>

9205
04:27:19.050 --> 04:27:22.740
<v Speaker 11>There's a lot of people that came to martial arts schools seem to be nuts.</v>

9206
04:27:22.920 --> 04:27:23.550
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

9207
04:27:23.550 --> 04:27:24.270
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

9208
04:27:24.270 --> 04:27:25.230
<v Speaker 11>Did you ever see that video?</v>

9209
04:27:25.231 --> 04:27:26.520
<v Speaker 11>It's a really disturbing one.</v>

9210
04:27:26.610 --> 04:27:30.210
<v Speaker 11>We played it a couple of weeks ago of this guy who was a karate student,</v>

9211
04:27:30.420 --> 04:27:31.980
<v Speaker 11>karate teacher and Connecticut,</v>

9212
04:27:32.130 --> 04:27:37.080
<v Speaker 11>and he was also a cop and him and his students beat the fuck out of this</v>

9213
04:27:37.081 --> 04:27:38.010
<v Speaker 11>homeless guy.</v>

9214
04:27:38.430 --> 04:27:41.240
<v Speaker 11>Like the guy they brought the guy in and the guy like was,</v>

9215
04:27:41.370 --> 04:27:44.520
<v Speaker 11>he was just a crazy person who was saying he knew karate and he's thrown like</v>

9216
04:27:44.521 --> 04:27:45.480
<v Speaker 11>crazy kicks and shit.</v>

9217
04:27:45.480 --> 04:27:48.300
<v Speaker 11>And so they have like essentially like a fight to the death.</v>

9218
04:27:48.690 --> 04:27:49.523
<v Speaker 11>The Gum?</v>

9219
04:27:49.560 --> 04:27:50.250
<v Speaker 11>Yes.</v>

9220
04:27:50.250 --> 04:27:50.491
<v Speaker 11>Yeah,</v>

9221
04:27:50.491 --> 04:27:51.120
<v Speaker 11>but like,</v>

9222
04:27:51.120 --> 04:27:53.220
<v Speaker 11>so I didn't know because I thought,</v>

9223
04:27:53.221 --> 04:27:53.371
<v Speaker 11>oh,</v>

9224
04:27:53.371 --> 04:27:54.390
<v Speaker 11>this looks ridiculous.</v>

9225
04:27:54.391 --> 04:27:56.400
<v Speaker 11>But then when the guy was actually trying to kill him,</v>

9226
04:27:56.401 --> 04:27:56.911
<v Speaker 11>he was like,</v>

9227
04:27:56.911 --> 04:27:59.700
<v Speaker 11>do it really well with his fucking made up shit.</v>

9228
04:27:59.970 --> 04:28:01.080
<v Speaker 11>Well the guy that,</v>

9229
04:28:01.081 --> 04:28:02.370
<v Speaker 11>he was shy as a black belt,</v>

9230
04:28:02.400 --> 04:28:03.540
<v Speaker 11>I mean this is cookbook.</v>

9231
04:28:04.520 --> 04:28:05.920
<v Speaker 11>He probably knew how to throw,</v>

9232
04:28:06.240 --> 04:28:07.800
<v Speaker 11>throw a few kicks here and there,</v>

9233
04:28:07.801 --> 04:28:09.240
<v Speaker 11>but the other guy,</v>

9234
04:28:09.390 --> 04:28:12.420
<v Speaker 11>I mean it wasn't long before he was on his back and the other guy was stomping</v>

9235
04:28:12.421 --> 04:28:13.254
<v Speaker 11>his head.</v>

9236
04:28:13.320 --> 04:28:13.531
<v Speaker 11>I mean,</v>

9237
04:28:13.531 --> 04:28:15.420
<v Speaker 11>it wasn't like a five minute fight or anything.</v>

9238
04:28:15.770 --> 04:28:16.160
<v Speaker 11>He,</v>

9239
04:28:16.160 --> 04:28:18.140
<v Speaker 11>he threw some flippy shit and some,</v>

9240
04:28:18.230 --> 04:28:19.930
<v Speaker 11>but eventually the guy beat the shit out of him.</v>

9241
04:28:20.100 --> 04:28:21.930
<v Speaker 11>But the point is that like,</v>

9242
04:28:22.110 --> 04:28:23.730
<v Speaker 11>that was like a crazy person.</v>

9243
04:28:24.870 --> 04:28:26.850
<v Speaker 11>They almost beat that guy to death when the dragging them away.</v>

9244
04:28:26.850 --> 04:28:28.110
<v Speaker 11>You see the blood from his head,</v>

9245
04:28:28.130 --> 04:28:29.580
<v Speaker 11>he like says they're dragging him away.</v>

9246
04:28:29.610 --> 04:28:30.443
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

9247
04:28:31.230 --> 04:28:33.900
<v Speaker 11>There was a lot of that going on in martial arts schools,</v>

9248
04:28:34.770 --> 04:28:35.450
<v Speaker 11>but that seemed,</v>

9249
04:28:35.450 --> 04:28:37.660
<v Speaker 11>that was older than the nineties.</v>

9250
04:28:38.190 --> 04:28:38.881
<v Speaker 11>That was old.</v>

9251
04:28:38.881 --> 04:28:39.900
<v Speaker 11>And I think that was the 80s.</v>

9252
04:28:39.960 --> 04:28:40.350
<v Speaker 11>Yeah,</v>

9253
04:28:40.350 --> 04:28:41.183
<v Speaker 11>yeah,</v>

9254
04:28:41.670 --> 04:28:41.821
<v Speaker 11>yeah.</v>

9255
04:28:41.821 --> 04:28:42.960
<v Speaker 11>There was no MMA then.</v>

9256
04:28:43.150 --> 04:28:43.890
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

9257
04:28:43.890 --> 04:28:44.161
<v Speaker 11>But,</v>

9258
04:28:44.161 --> 04:28:44.470
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>

9259
04:28:44.470 --> 04:28:49.470
<v Speaker 11>it was NHB but I mean there wasn't even any B then we had Hickson in and Hickson</v>

9260
04:28:49.710 --> 04:28:54.140
<v Speaker 11>was telling us the stories of the old [inaudible] Bray rivalries between the</v>

9261
04:28:54.150 --> 04:28:56.570
<v Speaker 11>Jujitsu guys and the loot delivery guys.</v>

9262
04:28:56.700 --> 04:28:58.860
<v Speaker 11>He would go there and there'd be guys waiting.</v>

9263
04:28:58.910 --> 04:29:02.130
<v Speaker 11>And it is Josh Thompson against Pat Heeley.</v>

9264
04:29:02.190 --> 04:29:02.580
<v Speaker 11>Yup.</v>

04:29:55.350 --> 04:29:56.250
<v Speaker 11>You're going to come in here,</v>

<v Speaker 11>I'm going to film it.</v>

9295
04:29:58.320 --> 04:29:59.050
<v Speaker 11>And uh,</v>

9296
04:29:59.050 --> 04:30:00.430
<v Speaker 11>everybody else is going to wait outside.</v>

9297
04:30:00.520 --> 04:30:00.971
<v Speaker 11>And then,</v>

9298
04:30:00.971 --> 04:30:01.330
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>

9299
04:30:01.330 --> 04:30:02.770
<v Speaker 11>whoever's left standing,</v>

9300
04:30:02.800 --> 04:30:03.633
<v Speaker 11>they'll leave.</v>

9301
04:30:03.790 --> 04:30:05.500
<v Speaker 11>So he takes him down,</v>

9302
04:30:05.980 --> 04:30:07.690
<v Speaker 11>beats his face into the,</v>

9303
04:30:07.720 --> 04:30:12.220
<v Speaker 11>like a tomato Stu and apparently filmed it and then they took pictures of the</v>

9304
04:30:12.221 --> 04:30:13.540
<v Speaker 11>guy after he left.</v>

9305
04:30:13.600 --> 04:30:17.950
<v Speaker 11>Like there's photos of Yohji Angelo leaving and his face is just a pulp in front</v>

9306
04:30:17.951 --> 04:30:18.580
<v Speaker 11>of [inaudible].</v>

9307
04:30:18.580 --> 04:30:19.690
<v Speaker 11>I seen those pictures,</v>

9308
04:30:20.070 --> 04:30:21.520
<v Speaker 11>so Hickson just beat,</v>

9309
04:30:22.150 --> 04:30:22.983
<v Speaker 11>beat him.</v>

9310
04:30:23.040 --> 04:30:24.000
<v Speaker 11>Beat Pete.</v>

9311
04:30:24.310 --> 04:30:24.961
<v Speaker 11>Do you remember this?</v>

9312
04:30:24.961 --> 04:30:25.794
<v Speaker 11>You can get them off him.</v>

9313
04:30:25.960 --> 04:30:27.610
<v Speaker 11>He's just mounted a beaten the shit out of him.</v>

9314
04:30:27.611 --> 04:30:29.050
<v Speaker 11>And then he decided to choke them unconscious.</v>

9315
04:30:29.290 --> 04:30:29.951
<v Speaker 11>But he tapped,</v>

9316
04:30:29.951 --> 04:30:31.930
<v Speaker 11>he taped his fists up with duct tape,</v>

9317
04:30:32.410 --> 04:30:34.090
<v Speaker 11>like Hixon on the way over there.</v>

9318
04:30:34.180 --> 04:30:34.630
<v Speaker 11>He was right.</v>

9319
04:30:34.630 --> 04:30:36.100
<v Speaker 11>He rode his bike from his house</v>

9320
04:30:37.630 --> 04:30:38.320
<v Speaker 11>and uh,</v>

9321
04:30:38.320 --> 04:30:39.031
<v Speaker 11>he wrote a test,</v>

9322
04:30:39.031 --> 04:30:40.690
<v Speaker 11>like a 10 speed there and on the way,</v>

9323
04:30:40.691 --> 04:30:45.550
<v Speaker 11>he's like fucking tape in his hands up with duck tape and he gets out and just</v>

9324
04:30:45.790 --> 04:30:46.623
<v Speaker 11>took him to who he was.</v>

9325
04:30:46.780 --> 04:30:49.000
<v Speaker 11>He was not just the best.</v>

9326
04:30:49.210 --> 04:30:50.043
<v Speaker 11>Right?</v>

9327
04:30:50.410 --> 04:30:52.450
<v Speaker 11>And that time it was like completely undisputed.</v>

9328
04:30:52.600 --> 04:30:53.433
<v Speaker 11>Like nobody said.</v>

9329
04:30:53.530 --> 04:30:56.530
<v Speaker 11>Well then there's Hickson and well the other argument is that this guy's the</v>

9330
04:30:56.531 --> 04:30:56.891
<v Speaker 11>best,</v>

9331
04:30:56.891 --> 04:30:58.000
<v Speaker 11>or maybe this guy's clothes.</v>

9332
04:30:58.540 --> 04:30:59.350
<v Speaker 11>There was no argument.</v>

9333
04:30:59.350 --> 04:31:01.060
<v Speaker 11>There's Hickson and then there was everybody else.</v>

9334
04:31:01.240 --> 04:31:03.850
<v Speaker 11>So this poor fool came over from Japan.</v>

9335
04:31:03.851 --> 04:31:06.640
<v Speaker 11>It just does completely fucked up.</v>

9336
04:31:06.970 --> 04:31:10.720
<v Speaker 11>And Hickson just beat his brains in these brains in its strangle them.</v>

9337
04:31:10.720 --> 04:31:13.180
<v Speaker 11>And then this is what the g Hixon is.</v>

9338
04:31:13.480 --> 04:31:14.860
<v Speaker 11>He doesn't even release the tape.</v>

9339
04:31:14.950 --> 04:31:15.221
<v Speaker 11>He's like,</v>

9340
04:31:15.221 --> 04:31:15.610
<v Speaker 11>no,</v>

9341
04:31:15.610 --> 04:31:16.960
<v Speaker 11>I've totally got it every now and then,</v>

9342
04:31:17.270 --> 04:31:18.103
<v Speaker 11>but that's my,</v>

9343
04:31:20.140 --> 04:31:20.973
<v Speaker 11>that's a car.</v>

9344
04:31:21.790 --> 04:31:22.623
<v Speaker 11>That's awesome.</v>

9345
04:31:23.890 --> 04:31:24.311
<v Speaker 11>He's like,</v>

9346
04:31:24.311 --> 04:31:25.030
<v Speaker 11>Nah,</v>

9347
04:31:25.030 --> 04:31:25.990
<v Speaker 11>I like looking at it.</v>

9348
04:31:26.050 --> 04:31:26.551
<v Speaker 11>It's mine.</v>

9349
04:31:26.551 --> 04:31:27.550
<v Speaker 11>Then you,</v>

9350
04:31:27.551 --> 04:31:28.800
<v Speaker 11>they think you just confirmed it.</v>

9351
04:31:28.801 --> 04:31:32.380
<v Speaker 11>Urban Legend for me cause I feel like I've heard pieces of that places.</v>

9352
04:31:32.410 --> 04:31:33.243
<v Speaker 11>Oh it's real.</v>

9353
04:31:33.250 --> 04:31:34.083
<v Speaker 11>It's real.</v>

9354
04:31:34.330 --> 04:31:37.050
<v Speaker 11>One of my happiest moments as a martial artist was I had dicks.</v>

9355
04:31:37.240 --> 04:31:41.890
<v Speaker 11>I had a dinner with Hickson and his family and crawling when he was younger.</v>

9356
04:31:41.920 --> 04:31:42.760
<v Speaker 11>Cron was like,</v>

9357
04:31:42.761 --> 04:31:43.594
<v Speaker 11>um,</v>

9358
04:31:43.780 --> 04:31:44.950
<v Speaker 11>I want to say it was 16,</v>

9359
04:31:45.040 --> 04:31:46.720
<v Speaker 11>maybe 16 or 17 at the time.</v>

9360
04:31:46.750 --> 04:31:47.830
<v Speaker 11>I think he's still in high school though.</v>

9361
04:31:47.831 --> 04:31:49.870
<v Speaker 11>I'm pretty sure Hickson was still married.</v>

9362
04:31:50.110 --> 04:31:53.800
<v Speaker 11>We had dinner and then we all went back to Hickson's house and watch fights.</v>

9363
04:31:54.160 --> 04:31:54.940
<v Speaker 11>And uh,</v>

9364
04:31:54.940 --> 04:31:59.410
<v Speaker 11>Hickson was just analyzing positions and talking about mistakes people are</v>

9365
04:31:59.411 --> 04:32:04.150
<v Speaker 11>making and talking about the right way to do things and he pushes shit aside and</v>

9366
04:32:04.151 --> 04:32:04.571
<v Speaker 11>is living,</v>

9367
04:32:04.571 --> 04:32:06.940
<v Speaker 11>really pushes the coffee table aside.</v>

9368
04:32:06.940 --> 04:32:07.690
<v Speaker 11>And he's like,</v>

9369
04:32:07.690 --> 04:32:07.860
<v Speaker 11>ah,</v>

9370
04:32:07.860 --> 04:32:08.693
<v Speaker 11>I'm going to get your guard,</v>

9371
04:32:08.980 --> 04:32:09.311
<v Speaker 11>I want to,</v>

9372
04:32:09.311 --> 04:32:10.720
<v Speaker 11>I want to show you some positions.</v>

9373
04:32:10.721 --> 04:32:12.400
<v Speaker 11>And he's like talking about positions like the,</v>

9374
04:32:12.401 --> 04:32:12.760
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

9375
04:32:12.760 --> 04:32:15.730
<v Speaker 11>he was talking about like mistakes that these guys in this fight tape,</v>

9376
04:32:15.731 --> 04:32:16.171
<v Speaker 11>they were watching.</v>

9377
04:32:16.171 --> 04:32:19.960
<v Speaker 11>We're watching VHS tapes and we're watching guys who'd made mistakes and this is</v>

9378
04:32:19.961 --> 04:32:23.410
<v Speaker 11>what's wrong and this is why Jujitsu is all you need when you have the best</v>

9379
04:32:23.411 --> 04:32:24.190
<v Speaker 11>Jujitsu.</v>

9380
04:32:24.190 --> 04:32:25.030
<v Speaker 11>Like he was,</v>

9381
04:32:25.060 --> 04:32:27.490
<v Speaker 11>he had this crazy,</v>

9382
04:32:27.910 --> 04:32:31.030
<v Speaker 11>crazy way of analyzing like positions,</v>

9383
04:32:31.360 --> 04:32:31.721
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

9384
04:32:31.721 --> 04:32:34.660
<v Speaker 11>it was really interesting to talk to them about like everything starts neutral.</v>

9385
04:32:34.690 --> 04:32:36.280
<v Speaker 11>It's like we started in neutral position,</v>

9386
04:32:36.700 --> 04:32:37.240
<v Speaker 11>he goes,</v>

9387
04:32:37.240 --> 04:32:38.560
<v Speaker 11>but once I get to one,</v>

9388
04:32:38.650 --> 04:32:38.981
<v Speaker 11>he goes,</v>

9389
04:32:38.981 --> 04:32:40.450
<v Speaker 11>there's no going back to zero.</v>

9390
04:32:40.990 --> 04:32:41.321
<v Speaker 11>He goes,</v>

9391
04:32:41.321 --> 04:32:46.321
<v Speaker 11>I go from one and then I'll go to two and then to three and then check me when</v>

9392
04:32:46.640 --> 04:32:47.680
<v Speaker 11>there's the way he said it was like,</v>

9393
04:32:47.710 --> 04:32:48.730
<v Speaker 11>Oh shit.</v>

9394
04:32:49.270 --> 04:32:52.450
<v Speaker 11>But it was the way said and once I go to one,</v>

9395
04:32:52.451 --> 04:32:54.010
<v Speaker 11>we're not going back to zero.</v>

9396
04:32:54.430 --> 04:32:55.263
<v Speaker 11>It was just,</v>

9397
04:32:56.210 --> 04:32:57.043
<v Speaker 11>this is,</v>

9398
04:32:57.050 --> 04:33:00.620
<v Speaker 11>I mean this is the words of a man who straggled many a motherfucker.</v>

9399
04:33:00.740 --> 04:33:01.573
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

9400
04:33:02.630 --> 04:33:03.920
<v Speaker 11>Once I started setting you up,</v>

9401
04:33:03.921 --> 04:33:04.520
<v Speaker 11>you're done.</v>

9402
04:33:04.520 --> 04:33:05.060
<v Speaker 11>Yeah,</v>

9403
04:33:05.060 --> 04:33:10.060
<v Speaker 11>I mean he just was so just a terminally confident,</v>

9404
04:33:11.090 --> 04:33:13.340
<v Speaker 11>and this is when he was still thinking about fight and fader.</v>

9405
04:33:13.580 --> 04:33:15.560
<v Speaker 11>He hadn't fought since 2000.</v>

9406
04:33:15.830 --> 04:33:17.210
<v Speaker 11>He fought in 2000.</v>

9407
04:33:17.360 --> 04:33:21.350
<v Speaker 11>He fought for knocky who was probably one of his toughest test for knock.</v>

9408
04:33:21.351 --> 04:33:22.760
<v Speaker 11>He fractured his orbital,</v>

9409
04:33:22.820 --> 04:33:24.340
<v Speaker 11>remember that he fractured you.</v>

9410
04:33:24.400 --> 04:33:25.570
<v Speaker 11>Hixon dog action,</v>

9411
04:33:26.150 --> 04:33:30.740
<v Speaker 11>orbital with a punch and then it wound up being for knocky on top,</v>

9412
04:33:30.741 --> 04:33:33.140
<v Speaker 11>kicking Hickson's legs on the bottom.</v>

9413
04:33:33.560 --> 04:33:34.640
<v Speaker 11>And Hickson was,</v>

9414
04:33:34.660 --> 04:33:35.120
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>

9415
04:33:35.120 --> 04:33:36.470
<v Speaker 11>trying to uptake his legs,</v>

9416
04:33:36.471 --> 04:33:40.070
<v Speaker 11>trying to up kick his knees and then somehow or another they had gotten to a</v>

9417
04:33:40.071 --> 04:33:44.330
<v Speaker 11>scramble and then Hicks and got his bag and Hanks and choked him to sleep.</v>

9418
04:33:44.660 --> 04:33:45.500
<v Speaker 11>What was that event?</v>

9419
04:33:45.560 --> 04:33:46.970
<v Speaker 11>I forget the coliseum.</v>

9420
04:33:47.000 --> 04:33:47.750
<v Speaker 11>Coliseum.</v>

9421
04:33:47.750 --> 04:33:48.501
<v Speaker 11>Coliseum.</v>

9422
04:33:48.501 --> 04:33:49.550
<v Speaker 11>I used to have the poster.</v>

9423
04:33:50.080 --> 04:33:52.190
<v Speaker 11>I have a shitload of those fucking pollsters fan.</v>

9424
04:33:52.940 --> 04:33:53.773
<v Speaker 11>But um,</v>

9425
04:33:53.900 --> 04:33:54.141
<v Speaker 11>yeah,</v>

9426
04:33:54.141 --> 04:33:57.140
<v Speaker 11>so Hixon that was his last fight and that was,</v>

9427
04:33:57.141 --> 04:33:57.351
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

9428
04:33:57.351 --> 04:33:58.370
<v Speaker 11>that was a fight that everybody,</v>

9429
04:33:58.371 --> 04:33:59.450
<v Speaker 11>a lot of people had said,</v>

9430
04:33:59.451 --> 04:34:02.690
<v Speaker 11>like what would happen to Hicks and fought a guy like Funai.</v>

9431
04:34:02.880 --> 04:34:07.220
<v Speaker 11>But he was one of the examples because he had fought in Japan Valley Tuto ran</v>

9432
04:34:07.221 --> 04:34:11.510
<v Speaker 11>through everybody and there'd been no one that had presented any like real</v>

9433
04:34:11.511 --> 04:34:12.800
<v Speaker 11>serious challenges to him.</v>

9434
04:34:12.950 --> 04:34:14.150
<v Speaker 11>Then he fucked a Kata,</v>

9435
04:34:14.420 --> 04:34:15.830
<v Speaker 11>ran through Takata,</v>

9436
04:34:15.920 --> 04:34:16.460
<v Speaker 11>remember that?</v>

9437
04:34:16.460 --> 04:34:17.293
<v Speaker 11>You know,</v>

9438
04:34:17.540 --> 04:34:19.640
<v Speaker 11>people forget Hickson was in pride number one.</v>

9439
04:34:20.780 --> 04:34:24.680
<v Speaker 11>Hickson was the guy who launched pride and it was like Krs one was,</v>

9440
04:34:24.681 --> 04:34:25.360
<v Speaker 11>do you remember that?</v>

9441
04:34:25.360 --> 04:34:26.960
<v Speaker 11>It's like Pri Keres Harris,</v>

9442
04:34:26.961 --> 04:34:29.840
<v Speaker 11>one promotion that was the carer has pride.</v>

<v Speaker 11>It's k something.</v>

9444
04:34:31.520 --> 04:34:34.940
<v Speaker 11>I feel like krs sounds right to one barely watching this.</v>

04:34:38.891 --> 04:34:40.730
<v Speaker 11>that's another thing they need on fight pass.</v>

9449
04:34:40.731 --> 04:34:41.990
<v Speaker 11>They need to put choke on there.</v>

9450
04:34:42.200 --> 04:34:42.801
<v Speaker 11>Oh yeah,</v>

9455
04:34:47.810 --> 04:34:48.140
<v Speaker 11>No,</v>

9456
04:34:48.140 --> 04:34:48.890

04:34:50.500 --> 04:34:51.333
<v Speaker 11>that's the greatest.</v>

9460
04:34:51.900 --> 04:34:52.733
<v Speaker 11>It's the greatest,</v>

9461
04:34:53.120 --> 04:34:53.953
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

9462
04:34:54.020 --> 04:34:56.870

9463
04:34:57.470 --> 04:34:58.303
<v Speaker 11>Dude,</v>

9464
04:34:58.770 --> 04:34:59.471
<v Speaker 11>I,</v>

9465
04:34:59.471 --> 04:35:00.080
<v Speaker 11>I,</v>

9466
04:35:00.080 --> 04:35:02.900
<v Speaker 11>when I first saw that I tried to do that stretch and I call,</v>

9467
04:35:02.910 --> 04:35:04.520
<v Speaker 11>he was twisted like a pretzel.</v>

9468
04:35:04.690 --> 04:35:05.480
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

9469
04:35:05.480 --> 04:35:07.160
<v Speaker 11>I've been trying to do that ever since.</v>

9470
04:35:08.180 --> 04:35:08.960
<v Speaker 11>I can't do it.</v>

9471
04:35:08.960 --> 04:35:09.051
<v Speaker 11>Well,</v>

9472
04:35:09.051 --> 04:35:10.010
<v Speaker 11>he can't do it anymore either.</v>

9473
04:35:10.011 --> 04:35:10.940
<v Speaker 11>If that makes me feel better.</v>

9474
04:35:11.390 --> 04:35:12.320
<v Speaker 11>So I don't think he can.</v>

9475
04:35:13.220 --> 04:35:16.970
<v Speaker 11>He's got quite a few injuries though from all was years of Jujitsu.</v>

9476
04:35:17.020 --> 04:35:17.853
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

9477
04:35:18.060 --> 04:35:18.310
<v Speaker 11>No,</v>

9478
04:35:18.310 --> 04:35:19.430
<v Speaker 11>nobody rides for free.</v>

9479
04:35:20.600 --> 04:35:21.433
<v Speaker 11>Yeah,</v>

9480
04:35:21.950 --> 04:35:22.311
<v Speaker 11>you got it.</v>

9481
04:35:22.311 --> 04:35:22.791
<v Speaker 11>But he was,</v>

9482
04:35:22.791 --> 04:35:23.420
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>

9483
04:35:23.420 --> 04:35:26.270
<v Speaker 11>he was like one of the first guys to,</v>

9484
04:35:26.870 --> 04:35:27.201
<v Speaker 11>to,</v>

9485
04:35:27.201 --> 04:35:27.380
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>

9486
04:35:27.380 --> 04:35:28.760
<v Speaker 11>incorporate yoga into his training.</v>

9487
04:35:28.761 --> 04:35:30.260
<v Speaker 11>Look at that stretch lose was doing there.</v>

9488
04:35:34.550 --> 04:35:36.530
<v Speaker 11>He was seriously into yoga.</v>

9489
04:35:37.030 --> 04:35:39.530
<v Speaker 11>He had ridiculous posture or a ridiculous,</v>

9490
04:35:39.531 --> 04:35:40.101
<v Speaker 11>our balance.</v>

9491
04:35:40.101 --> 04:35:40.934
<v Speaker 11>Rather,</v>

9492
04:35:41.060 --> 04:35:43.430
<v Speaker 11>he received that shitty did on balance beams.</v>

9493
04:35:43.550 --> 04:35:47.000
<v Speaker 11>He would walk on one leg and then lift his leg completely over his head and a</v>

9494
04:35:47.001 --> 04:35:47.810
<v Speaker 11>standing split.</v>

9495
04:35:47.810 --> 04:35:48.890
<v Speaker 11>Wasn't that on choke?</v>

9496
04:35:49.380 --> 04:35:50.213
<v Speaker 11>Might've been.</v>

9497
04:35:50.630 --> 04:35:51.291
<v Speaker 11>I think it wasn't,</v>

9498
04:35:51.291 --> 04:35:52.760
<v Speaker 11>it was on something else similar to it.</v>

9499
04:35:53.570 --> 04:35:54.800
<v Speaker 11>This a fucking good fight.</v>

9500
04:35:54.801 --> 04:35:55.890
<v Speaker 11>We're paying attention.</v>

9501
04:35:57.740 --> 04:35:58.860
<v Speaker 6>I have no idea who won.</v>

9502
04:36:03.690 --> 04:36:03.841
<v Speaker 11>Well,</v>

9503
04:36:03.841 --> 04:36:04.970
<v Speaker 11>I've been kind of paying attention.</v>

9504
04:36:04.980 --> 04:36:05.740
<v Speaker 11>I still can.</v>

9505
04:36:05.740 --> 04:36:06.573
<v Speaker 11>Here's one.</v>

9506
04:36:07.200 --> 04:36:07.441
<v Speaker 11>Yeah,</v>

9507
04:36:07.441 --> 04:36:08.011
<v Speaker 11>no clues,</v>

9508
04:36:08.011 --> 04:36:08.340
<v Speaker 11>right.</v>

9509
04:36:08.340 --> 04:36:08.820
<v Speaker 11>Ooh.</v>

9510
04:36:08.820 --> 04:36:11.220
<v Speaker 11>But I do now know [inaudible] story.</v>

9511
04:36:12.510 --> 04:36:13.380
<v Speaker 11>I know that now.</v>

9512
04:36:14.190 --> 04:36:15.480
<v Speaker 11>Yohji Yohji Yamamoto.</v>

9513
04:36:15.540 --> 04:36:16.373
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

9514
04:36:16.380 --> 04:36:16.561
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

9515
04:36:16.561 --> 04:36:18.930
<v Speaker 11>That's apparently a completely legit story.</v>

9516
04:36:21.420 --> 04:36:25.320
<v Speaker 11>It's definitely legit that he did it to him and apparently completely jet that</v>

9517
04:36:25.321 --> 04:36:26.154
<v Speaker 11>he has the tape.</v>

9518
04:36:27.510 --> 04:36:30.600
<v Speaker 11>But that's just what a gangster he is like he could sell that tape,</v>

9519
04:36:30.990 --> 04:36:32.250
<v Speaker 11>he can make money off that tape.</v>

9520
04:36:32.320 --> 04:36:32.910
<v Speaker 11>And he's like,</v>

9521
04:36:32.910 --> 04:36:33.270
<v Speaker 11>yeah,</v>

9522
04:36:33.270 --> 04:36:34.103
<v Speaker 11>it's mine,</v>

9523
04:36:34.920 --> 04:36:35.720
<v Speaker 11>it's mine.</v>

9524
04:36:35.720 --> 04:36:37.080
<v Speaker 11>He's also the guy that like,</v>

9525
04:36:37.081 --> 04:36:38.010
<v Speaker 11>he had a price,</v>

9526
04:36:38.280 --> 04:36:38.880
<v Speaker 11>like you said,</v>

9527
04:36:38.880 --> 04:36:39.151
<v Speaker 11>look,</v>

9528
04:36:39.151 --> 04:36:41.850
<v Speaker 11>I'll fight for this amount if you don't have that amount of not fighting.</v>

9529
04:36:42.570 --> 04:36:43.890
<v Speaker 11>And that was it.</v>

9530
04:36:44.160 --> 04:36:46.330
<v Speaker 11>I mean there was no negotiating this discussion.</v>

9531
04:36:46.340 --> 04:36:46.800
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

9532
04:36:46.800 --> 04:36:47.633
<v Speaker 11>I mean he,</v>

9533
04:36:47.730 --> 04:36:52.320
<v Speaker 11>and a lot of ways he raised the expectations at fighters had for purses.</v>

9534
04:36:52.410 --> 04:36:53.243
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

9535
04:36:53.380 --> 04:36:57.690
<v Speaker 11>Because he always had very high expectations for himself and very high</v>

9536
04:36:57.691 --> 04:36:58.530
<v Speaker 11>requirements,</v>

9537
04:36:58.740 --> 04:36:59.040
<v Speaker 11>you know?</v>

9538
04:36:59.040 --> 04:36:59.131
<v Speaker 11>And,</v>

9539
04:36:59.131 --> 04:37:01.560
<v Speaker 11>and people said that he was like pricing himself out of fights,</v>

9540
04:37:01.950 --> 04:37:02.450
<v Speaker 11>but he had just,</v>

9541
04:37:02.450 --> 04:37:03.211
<v Speaker 11>just decided,</v>

9542
04:37:03.211 --> 04:37:04.650
<v Speaker 11>I think like this is what I'm worth.</v>

9543
04:37:04.860 --> 04:37:05.280
<v Speaker 11>Right.</v>

9544
04:37:05.280 --> 04:37:06.021
<v Speaker 11>And is he there?</v>

9545
04:37:06.021 --> 04:37:09.390
<v Speaker 11>I get this or they don't want to pay me what I'm worth so I don't fight for what</v>

9546
04:37:09.391 --> 04:37:10.190
<v Speaker 11>I'm not worth.</v>

9547
04:37:10.190 --> 04:37:10.470
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

9548
04:37:10.470 --> 04:37:11.700
<v Speaker 11>Or for less than what I'm worth.</v>

9549
04:37:12.690 --> 04:37:13.560
<v Speaker 11>Is this the main event?</v>

9550
04:37:14.160 --> 04:37:16.770
<v Speaker 11>It was doing 20 hour podcasts here.</v>

9551
04:37:17.250 --> 04:37:21.500
<v Speaker 11>What the fuck this thing start at six 30 and that was the undercard remember,</v>

9552
04:37:21.810 --> 04:37:22.141
<v Speaker 11>I know.</v>

9553
04:37:22.141 --> 04:37:22.980
<v Speaker 11>We didn't know though.</v>

9554
04:37:24.210 --> 04:37:26.040
<v Speaker 11>I thought we were here for the fights.</v>

9555
04:37:26.370 --> 04:37:27.250
<v Speaker 11>Gruen hearts.</v>

9556
04:37:27.470 --> 04:37:28.050
<v Speaker 11>Amen.</v>

9557
04:37:28.050 --> 04:37:28.290
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

9558
04:37:28.290 --> 04:37:29.640
<v Speaker 11>Greenheart growing heart.</v>

9559
04:37:30.030 --> 04:37:31.780
<v Speaker 11>Do you think you won a,</v>

9560
04:37:32.040 --> 04:37:33.130
<v Speaker 11>I think Nikki one.</v>

9561
04:37:33.150 --> 04:37:34.560
<v Speaker 11>He looked a little sharper but I didn't,</v>

9562
04:37:34.561 --> 04:37:35.940
<v Speaker 11>I wasn't paying that close attention.</v>

9563
04:37:37.840 --> 04:37:39.030
<v Speaker 11>That's a real problem isn't it?</v>

9564
04:37:39.060 --> 04:37:39.893
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

9565
04:37:40.170 --> 04:37:41.640
<v Speaker 11>Bunch of fucking blabber mouth</v>

9566
04:37:43.250 --> 04:37:43.710
<v Speaker 11>I think.</v>

9567
04:37:43.710 --> 04:37:44.980
<v Speaker 11>I think it was in a fight though.</v>

9568
04:37:45.030 --> 04:37:46.770
<v Speaker 11>I think we talked about some important shit though.</v>

9569
04:37:46.860 --> 04:37:47.820
<v Speaker 11>I like stories.</v>

9570
04:37:48.510 --> 04:37:49.343
<v Speaker 11>Yeah,</v>

9571
04:37:49.500 --> 04:37:50.480
<v Speaker 11>I like story.</v>

9572
04:37:52.720 --> 04:37:53.820
<v Speaker 11>That's what I sounded like</v>

9573
04:37:55.560 --> 04:37:56.440
<v Speaker 11>I do to men.</v>

9574
04:37:56.630 --> 04:37:57.463
<v Speaker 11>But I did too.</v>

9575
04:37:58.500 --> 04:37:58.741
<v Speaker 11>Yeah,</v>

9576
04:37:58.741 --> 04:38:00.410
<v Speaker 11>like a Hixon Yohji on Joe's story.</v>

9577
04:38:00.411 --> 04:38:01.110
<v Speaker 11>And those are,</v>

9578
04:38:01.110 --> 04:38:02.460
<v Speaker 11>those are like legendary stories.</v>

9579
04:38:02.461 --> 04:38:07.461
<v Speaker 11>Like if you went back and you read about the tales of me and molten Musashi and</v>

9580
04:38:08.191 --> 04:38:09.660
<v Speaker 11>is all of a sword fights.</v>

9581
04:38:09.690 --> 04:38:10.120
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

9582
04:38:10.120 --> 04:38:10.410
<v Speaker 11>You,</v>

9583
04:38:10.410 --> 04:38:12.960
<v Speaker 11>you'd want to hear about those from someone who actually knew about them and</v>

9584
04:38:12.961 --> 04:38:13.860
<v Speaker 11>they could tell you about them.</v>

9585
04:38:14.100 --> 04:38:14.581
<v Speaker 11>Like we're,</v>

9586
04:38:14.581 --> 04:38:17.610
<v Speaker 11>we're so lucky because like obviously it's not the same as sword fights,</v>

9587
04:38:17.611 --> 04:38:20.700
<v Speaker 11>but these crazy legendary martial arts stories,</v>

9588
04:38:20.790 --> 04:38:22.050
<v Speaker 11>they happen in our lifetime.</v>

9589
04:38:22.260 --> 04:38:25.470
<v Speaker 11>So it's not like we're hearing about something from the 14 hundreds we're</v>

9590
04:38:25.471 --> 04:38:29.940
<v Speaker 11>hearing about some shit that happened and you know the year 95 yeah.</v>

9591
04:38:30.050 --> 04:38:30.780
<v Speaker 11>Kinda cool.</v>

9592
04:38:30.780 --> 04:38:31.171
<v Speaker 11>They'll know.</v>

9593
04:38:31.171 --> 04:38:32.004
<v Speaker 11>That's really cool.</v>

9594
04:38:33.170 --> 04:38:36.630
<v Speaker 11>I'm going to tell you something I would recommend or you might like this.</v>

9595
04:38:36.631 --> 04:38:37.464
<v Speaker 11>I don't know.</v>

9596
04:38:38.880 --> 04:38:39.713
<v Speaker 11>My son,</v>

9597
04:38:40.050 --> 04:38:42.090
<v Speaker 11>he just turned 13 this summer,</v>

9598
04:38:42.150 --> 04:38:42.510
<v Speaker 11>but,</v>

9599
04:38:42.510 --> 04:38:43.770
<v Speaker 11>but two or three years ago,</v>

9600
04:38:43.800 --> 04:38:45.430
<v Speaker 11>he was like 10 or 11 we were in Austin.</v>

9601
04:38:45.460 --> 04:38:45.841
<v Speaker 11>I was like,</v>

9602
04:38:45.841 --> 04:38:46.770
<v Speaker 11>you know what Yvonne,</v>

9603
04:38:46.800 --> 04:38:48.240
<v Speaker 11>we're going to do a podcast together.</v>

9604
04:38:48.241 --> 04:38:51.490
<v Speaker 11>So we sat down and we talked for an hour and it's just for me and,</v>

9605
04:38:51.510 --> 04:38:52.890
<v Speaker 11>and I'm going to leave it for him,</v>

9606
04:38:53.230 --> 04:38:53.980
<v Speaker 11>you know.</v>

9607
04:38:53.980 --> 04:38:57.670
<v Speaker 1>But we talked about a bunch of stuff and it was one of the coolest conversations</v>

9608
04:38:57.671 --> 04:38:58.504
<v Speaker 1>I've ever had.</v>

9609
04:38:58.540 --> 04:38:59.980
<v Speaker 1>You should probably do that with your girls.</v>

9610
04:38:59.981 --> 04:39:00.790
<v Speaker 1>Cause when it's,</v>

9611
04:39:00.790 --> 04:39:01.710
<v Speaker 1>when they're older and,</v>

9612
04:39:01.720 --> 04:39:02.281
<v Speaker 1>and if,</v>

9613
04:39:02.281 --> 04:39:06.130
<v Speaker 1>if you're gone when they're old or when they're your age now,</v>

9614
04:39:06.350 --> 04:39:06.950
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

9615
04:39:06.950 --> 04:39:09.370
<v Speaker 1>They'll have to go back and listen to if they want to.</v>

9616
04:39:09.550 --> 04:39:09.851
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

9617
04:39:09.851 --> 04:39:10.810
<v Speaker 1>that's a good idea.</v>

9618
04:39:11.040 --> 04:39:11.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

9619
04:39:11.370 --> 04:39:13.600
<v Speaker 1>I have a little chat with them on a recording.</v>

9620
04:39:13.630 --> 04:39:14.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

9621
04:39:14.050 --> 04:39:14.831
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good idea,</v>

9622
04:39:14.831 --> 04:39:15.230
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

9623
04:39:15.230 --> 04:39:16.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do that with my,</v>

9624
04:39:16.481 --> 04:39:17.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do it with my,</v>

9625
04:39:17.300 --> 04:39:18.040
<v Speaker 1>my daughter.</v>

9626
04:39:18.040 --> 04:39:19.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing my mom.</v>

9627
04:39:19.660 --> 04:39:20.510
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good idea.</v>

9628
04:39:20.810 --> 04:39:22.720
<v Speaker 1>I think if my dad died when I was 12,</v>

9629
04:39:22.760 --> 04:39:22.930
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

9630
04:39:22.930 --> 04:39:23.500
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>

9631
04:39:23.500 --> 04:39:23.981
<v Speaker 1>if I could,</v>

9632
04:39:23.981 --> 04:39:26.320
<v Speaker 1>if I had a tape of us talking,</v>

9633
04:39:27.490 --> 04:39:28.180
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

9634
04:39:28.180 --> 04:39:29.013
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

9635
04:39:29.290 --> 04:39:30.430
<v Speaker 1>Just imagine having that.</v>

9636
04:39:30.940 --> 04:39:31.773
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

9637
04:39:32.840 --> 04:39:33.800
<v Speaker 1>Hi everybody.</v>

9638
04:39:34.060 --> 04:39:35.680
<v Speaker 1>I would recommend everybody do that.</v>

9639
04:39:35.710 --> 04:39:37.540
<v Speaker 1>Just if you have an iPhone or whatever.</v>

9640
04:39:37.541 --> 04:39:41.560
<v Speaker 1>It just talk to your kid for a bit and we talked about so many things we were</v>

9641
04:39:41.561 --> 04:39:42.160
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

9642
04:39:42.160 --> 04:39:42.551
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

9643
04:39:42.551 --> 04:39:43.810
<v Speaker 1>if you could go back in time,</v>

9644
04:39:43.811 --> 04:39:44.710
<v Speaker 1>if you had a time machine,</v>

9645
04:39:44.711 --> 04:39:45.251
<v Speaker 1>what would you do?</v>

9646
04:39:45.251 --> 04:39:45.821
<v Speaker 1>Where would you go?</v>

9647
04:39:45.821 --> 04:39:46.654
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

9648
04:39:47.290 --> 04:39:49.060
<v Speaker 1>I dunno what the 19 hundreds and I'm like,</v>

9649
04:39:49.090 --> 04:39:51.040
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in 1,930 [inaudible] talking to</v>

9650
04:39:55.210 --> 04:39:55.541
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

9651
04:39:55.541 --> 04:39:56.540
<v Speaker 1>Look at the 99.</v>

9652
04:39:56.590 --> 04:39:57.070
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

9653
04:39:57.070 --> 04:39:58.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

9654
04:39:58.180 --> 04:39:59.700
<v Speaker 1>back in the fucking old day.</v>

9655
04:40:01.080 --> 04:40:02.260
<v Speaker 1>So like things like that.</v>

9656
04:40:02.261 --> 04:40:06.250
<v Speaker 1>I then somehow we got to talking about my dad and um,</v>

9657
04:40:06.460 --> 04:40:09.190
<v Speaker 1>about me being a kid around my dad and he was like,</v>

9658
04:40:10.240 --> 04:40:11.380
<v Speaker 1>if I had a time machine,</v>

9659
04:40:11.381 --> 04:40:12.214
<v Speaker 1>I would go back.</v>

9660
04:40:12.760 --> 04:40:14.680
<v Speaker 1>I would go back and meet your dad.</v>

9661
04:40:15.070 --> 04:40:15.731
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

9662
04:40:15.731 --> 04:40:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

9663
04:40:16.090 --> 04:40:16.690
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

9664
04:40:16.690 --> 04:40:17.950
<v Speaker 1>and that's what made me think,</v>

9665
04:40:17.951 --> 04:40:18.161
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

9666
04:40:18.161 --> 04:40:19.330
<v Speaker 1>this is something we should do.</v>

9667
04:40:19.331 --> 04:40:22.420
<v Speaker 1>Because then if he decides he wants kids or if he has kids or whatever,</v>

9668
04:40:22.990 --> 04:40:24.130
<v Speaker 1>if they don't meet me,</v>

9669
04:40:24.640 --> 04:40:25.473
<v Speaker 1>they'd have that.</v>

9670
04:40:25.540 --> 04:40:26.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

9671
04:40:26.110 --> 04:40:27.100
<v Speaker 1>If you wanted to share it.</v>

9672
04:40:27.490 --> 04:40:27.731
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

9673
04:40:27.731 --> 04:40:28.150
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

9674
04:40:28.150 --> 04:40:28.983
<v Speaker 1>that's important.</v>

9675
04:40:29.020 --> 04:40:29.680
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>

9676
04:40:29.680 --> 04:40:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

9677
04:40:30.580 --> 04:40:31.450
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see that.</v>

9678
04:40:31.870 --> 04:40:34.000
<v Speaker 1>He spun them down and hit him with a knee on the way down</v>

9679
04:40:34.270 --> 04:40:37.000
<v Speaker 10>or putting combinations together.</v>

9680
04:40:39.070 --> 04:40:39.840
<v Speaker 10>Wow.</v>

9681
04:40:39.840 --> 04:40:41.900
<v Speaker 1>Every time I was looking at getting a little bit,</v>

9682
04:40:46.720 --> 04:40:47.620
<v Speaker 1>this is a crazy fight.</v>

9683
04:40:47.621 --> 04:40:48.760
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>

9684
04:40:48.840 --> 04:40:49.673
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9685
04:40:50.110 --> 04:40:52.960
<v Speaker 1>Joseph Valtellina he's saying that he came on too late.</v>

9686
04:40:53.480 --> 04:40:54.313
<v Speaker 1>They needed more.</v>

9687
04:40:54.430 --> 04:40:55.263
<v Speaker 1>We'll see.</v>

9688
04:40:55.360 --> 04:40:56.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9689
04:40:56.020 --> 04:41:00.150
<v Speaker 1>Valtellina he had to stop fighting because of a head trauma right now.</v>

9690
04:41:00.160 --> 04:41:00.851
<v Speaker 1>That's what he said.</v>

9691
04:41:00.851 --> 04:41:01.361
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I,</v>

9692
04:41:01.361 --> 04:41:02.194
<v Speaker 1>that's what I heard.</v>

9693
04:41:02.320 --> 04:41:02.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

9694
04:41:02.561 --> 04:41:03.221
<v Speaker 1>I said he was,</v>

9695
04:41:03.221 --> 04:41:03.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9696
04:41:03.460 --> 04:41:04.960
<v Speaker 1>having concussion syndrome.</v>

9697
04:41:05.680 --> 04:41:06.970
<v Speaker 1>It's been pretty open about it.</v>

9698
04:41:10.510 --> 04:41:11.081
<v Speaker 1>How did he,</v>

9699
04:41:11.081 --> 04:41:12.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean he how many times he'd been knocked down?</v>

9700
04:41:13.720 --> 04:41:14.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything.</v>

9701
04:41:14.470 --> 04:41:16.320
<v Speaker 1>It's from the knock out or just sneaky holster.</v>

9702
04:41:16.330 --> 04:41:17.230
<v Speaker 1>John stopped him.</v>

9703
04:41:18.070 --> 04:41:21.010
<v Speaker 1>Probably just shots to the head shots absorbed.</v>

9704
04:41:21.011 --> 04:41:21.341
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

9705
04:41:21.341 --> 04:41:21.821
<v Speaker 1>Nikki holds.</v>

9706
04:41:21.821 --> 04:41:22.840
<v Speaker 1>Can you got hit way more?</v>

9707
04:41:23.650 --> 04:41:24.281
<v Speaker 1>Hey shilling.</v>

9708
04:41:24.281 --> 04:41:24.730
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

9709
04:41:24.730 --> 04:41:29.290
<v Speaker 1>do you know that there used to be roommates or people wanted to see Joe Rogan in</v>

9710
04:41:29.291 --> 04:41:30.124
<v Speaker 1>the octagon?</v>

9711
04:41:30.130 --> 04:41:30.963
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

9712
04:41:30.980 --> 04:41:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Again was it wasn't like,</v>

9713
04:41:32.650 --> 04:41:33.550
<v Speaker 1>do you know about the room,</v>

9714
04:41:33.551 --> 04:41:34.560
<v Speaker 1>about you and and,</v>

9715
04:41:34.561 --> 04:41:37.180
<v Speaker 1>and then played Wesley Snipes?</v>

9716
04:41:37.300 --> 04:41:37.871
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

9717
04:41:37.871 --> 04:41:38.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

9718
04:41:38.111 --> 04:41:39.130
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about that before,</v>

9719
04:41:39.131 --> 04:41:39.410
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

9720
04:41:39.410 --> 04:41:41.350
<v Speaker 1>that it was actually supposed to happen.</v>

9721
04:41:41.470 --> 04:41:41.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

9722
04:41:41.880 --> 04:41:42.810
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that was a,</v>

9723
04:41:42.900 --> 04:41:45.130
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't just a rumor at the time.</v>

9724
04:41:45.131 --> 04:41:45.910
<v Speaker 1>I was willing to,</v>

9725
04:41:45.910 --> 04:41:46.570
<v Speaker 1>I just like,</v>

9726
04:41:46.570 --> 04:41:48.160
<v Speaker 1>I know you know what you're trying to do it all.</v>

9727
04:41:48.850 --> 04:41:49.241
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

9728
04:41:49.241 --> 04:41:50.950
<v Speaker 1>what are the odds is going to keep me off of,</v>

9729
04:41:51.470 --> 04:41:52.303
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't,</v>

9730
04:41:52.420 --> 04:41:55.520
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't think that anybody who didn't know any Jujitsu could learn a</v>

9731
04:41:55.521 --> 04:41:56.130
<v Speaker 1>quick,</v>

9732
04:41:56.130 --> 04:41:56.391
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

9733
04:41:56.391 --> 04:41:57.680
<v Speaker 1>I was already a brown belt by then.</v>

9734
04:41:58.070 --> 04:41:58.401
<v Speaker 1>I was just,</v>

9735
04:41:58.401 --> 04:42:01.070
<v Speaker 1>I just knew what happened when a brown belt fights a white belt.</v>

9736
04:42:01.100 --> 04:42:01.401
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

9737
04:42:01.401 --> 04:42:02.510
<v Speaker 1>I just can't imagine,</v>

9738
04:42:02.511 --> 04:42:04.010
<v Speaker 1>and I know how to stand up.</v>

9739
04:42:04.190 --> 04:42:07.980
<v Speaker 1>And even if I wasn't good at striking anymore,</v>

9740
04:42:08.000 --> 04:42:09.380
<v Speaker 1>like as I was when I was a kid,</v>

9741
04:42:09.680 --> 04:42:14.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm good enough to know what to not do and where to not be.</v>

9742
04:42:14.840 --> 04:42:17.690
<v Speaker 1>And if I get ahold of someone who doesn't know Jujitsu,</v>

9743
04:42:17.691 --> 04:42:20.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure I'm choking the fuck out of them.</v>

9744
04:42:20.390 --> 04:42:21.230
<v Speaker 1>And that was my thought.</v>

9745
04:42:21.231 --> 04:42:21.501
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

9746
04:42:21.501 --> 04:42:22.730
<v Speaker 1>this guy really wants to do this.</v>

9747
04:42:23.180 --> 04:42:23.540
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

9748
04:42:23.540 --> 04:42:24.070
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

9749
04:42:24.070 --> 04:42:24.800
<v Speaker 1>I know he doesn't,</v>

9750
04:42:24.800 --> 04:42:25.790
<v Speaker 1>he's never wrestled.</v>

9751
04:42:25.850 --> 04:42:28.790
<v Speaker 1>He never had a competitive martial arts match,</v>

9752
04:42:28.791 --> 04:42:30.830
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a kickboxing fight or karate,</v>

9753
04:42:30.831 --> 04:42:31.610
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

9754
04:42:31.610 --> 04:42:32.030
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

9755
04:42:32.030 --> 04:42:33.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to choke the fuck out of this guy.</v>

9756
04:42:33.770 --> 04:42:36.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get ahold of him when I was squeeze the shit out of them and</v>

9757
04:42:36.201 --> 04:42:38.090
<v Speaker 1>they're going to give me a lot of money and he's probably not even going to get</v>

9758
04:42:38.091 --> 04:42:38.690
<v Speaker 1>hurt.</v>

9759
04:42:38.690 --> 04:42:39.523
<v Speaker 1>That's what I thought.</v>

9760
04:42:39.740 --> 04:42:42.440
<v Speaker 1>And it turned out really what it was was just,</v>

9761
04:42:42.860 --> 04:42:47.090
<v Speaker 1>he was desperate and a real bad situation with the IRS.</v>

9762
04:42:47.390 --> 04:42:51.110
<v Speaker 1>And so they were trying to figure out some way to generate money.</v>

9763
04:42:51.140 --> 04:42:52.340
<v Speaker 1>And one of the ways they said,</v>

9764
04:42:52.341 --> 04:42:52.611
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

9765
04:42:52.611 --> 04:42:55.090
<v Speaker 1>let's just see if we can come up with a,</v>

9766
04:42:55.091 --> 04:42:56.990
<v Speaker 1>a crazy paper view fight.</v>

9767
04:42:57.020 --> 04:43:00.770
<v Speaker 1>And they wanted to fight John Claude van Damme and some paper if you fight,</v>

9768
04:43:01.220 --> 04:43:02.510
<v Speaker 1>the guy they brought it to was this guy,</v>

9769
04:43:02.511 --> 04:43:03.710
<v Speaker 1>Campbell Mclaren,</v>

9770
04:43:03.980 --> 04:43:06.200
<v Speaker 1>who was one of the original producers of the UFC.</v>

9771
04:43:06.201 --> 04:43:06.561
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

9772
04:43:06.561 --> 04:43:06.711
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

9773
04:43:06.711 --> 04:43:08.600
<v Speaker 1>nobody's going to pay to see you.</v>

9774
04:43:08.630 --> 04:43:10.130
<v Speaker 1>And John Claude van Damme fight.</v>

9775
04:43:10.400 --> 04:43:11.150
<v Speaker 1>I disagreed.</v>

9776
04:43:11.150 --> 04:43:11.983
<v Speaker 1>I pay for it.</v>

9777
04:43:12.410 --> 04:43:13.191
<v Speaker 1>But they said,</v>

9778
04:43:13.191 --> 04:43:14.450
<v Speaker 1>no one's going to pay for that.</v>

9779
04:43:14.480 --> 04:43:14.721
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

9780
04:43:14.721 --> 04:43:18.530
<v Speaker 1>you have to fight someone who's a w I think the word he used was current.</v>

9781
04:43:18.840 --> 04:43:19.221
<v Speaker 1>So he said,</v>

9782
04:43:19.221 --> 04:43:20.390
<v Speaker 1>would you fight Joe Rogan?</v>

9783
04:43:20.391 --> 04:43:21.590
<v Speaker 1>This wouldn't fear factor was on.</v>

9784
04:43:22.100 --> 04:43:22.491
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

9785
04:43:22.491 --> 04:43:22.760
<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>

9786
04:43:22.760 --> 04:43:23.240
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it.</v>

9787
04:43:23.240 --> 04:43:23.990
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it.</v>

9788
04:43:23.990 --> 04:43:25.160
<v Speaker 1>And so they came to me and I went,</v>

9789
04:43:25.460 --> 04:43:26.180
<v Speaker 1>how much money?</v>

9790
04:43:26.180 --> 04:43:27.230
<v Speaker 1>And then they started talking.</v>

9791
04:43:27.231 --> 04:43:27.471
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

9792
04:43:27.471 --> 04:43:27.980
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

9793
04:43:27.980 --> 04:43:28.251
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

9794
04:43:28.251 --> 04:43:28.611
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it.</v>

9795
04:43:28.611 --> 04:43:28.851
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

9796
04:43:28.851 --> 04:43:29.361
<v Speaker 1>are you serious?</v>

9797
04:43:29.361 --> 04:43:29.511
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

9798
04:43:29.511 --> 04:43:29.721
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

9799
04:43:29.721 --> 04:43:30.290
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

9800
04:43:30.290 --> 04:43:30.680
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

9801
04:43:30.680 --> 04:43:31.513
<v Speaker 1>I'll fight that guy.</v>

9802
04:43:32.160 --> 04:43:32.810
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

9803
04:43:32.810 --> 04:43:33.350
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

9804
04:43:33.350 --> 04:43:34.183
<v Speaker 1>we'll see what happens.</v>

9805
04:43:34.370 --> 04:43:35.001
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

9806
04:43:35.001 --> 04:43:35.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9807
04:43:35.300 --> 04:43:37.970
<v Speaker 1>then there was like a bunch of changes to the contract.</v>

9808
04:43:37.971 --> 04:43:38.870
<v Speaker 1>It was supposed to be 50,</v>

9809
04:43:38.871 --> 04:43:39.411
<v Speaker 1>50.</v>

9810
04:43:39.411 --> 04:43:39.951
<v Speaker 1>Then it changed.</v>

9811
04:43:39.951 --> 04:43:40.221
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

9812
04:43:40.221 --> 04:43:42.020
<v Speaker 1>okay to that to said whatever,</v>

9813
04:43:42.050 --> 04:43:42.620
<v Speaker 1>let's just do it.</v>

9814
04:43:42.620 --> 04:43:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Let's just do it.</v>

9815
04:43:43.430 --> 04:43:43.701
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

9816
04:43:43.701 --> 04:43:44.120
<v Speaker 1>let's do it.</v>

9817
04:43:44.120 --> 04:43:44.281
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

9818
04:43:44.281 --> 04:43:45.830
<v Speaker 1>and I was training for for quite a while.</v>

9819
04:43:46.160 --> 04:43:50.180
<v Speaker 1>I was training for it for a couple of months and I was fucking tired all the</v>

9820
04:43:50.181 --> 04:43:51.014
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

9821
04:43:51.110 --> 04:43:51.630
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to,</v>

9822
04:43:51.630 --> 04:43:53.840
<v Speaker 1>with rob came in and I was doing Jujitsu,</v>

9823
04:43:54.530 --> 04:43:55.760
<v Speaker 1>so I'd be hitting pads it,</v>

9824
04:43:55.761 --> 04:43:58.970
<v Speaker 1>rob came and it's barn with him and sparring with some of the students and then</v>

9825
04:43:58.971 --> 04:44:01.250
<v Speaker 1>a good Jujitsu and I was fucking tired.</v>

9826
04:44:01.251 --> 04:44:02.084
<v Speaker 1>And it made me,</v>

9827
04:44:02.510 --> 04:44:05.810
<v Speaker 1>I always knew how hard it was to,</v>

9828
04:44:05.811 --> 04:44:07.700
<v Speaker 1>to be a professional MMA fighter.</v>

9829
04:44:07.701 --> 04:44:09.350
<v Speaker 1>I'd seen people work at it.</v>

9830
04:44:09.351 --> 04:44:11.300
<v Speaker 1>I'd seen guys struggle.</v>

9831
04:44:11.301 --> 04:44:14.930
<v Speaker 1>I'd seen guys like Connor hewn was like a young guy was coming up and the</v>

9832
04:44:15.230 --> 04:44:18.920
<v Speaker 1>amateur ranks and I was seeing him fight it out of legends.</v>

9833
04:44:19.040 --> 04:44:20.480
<v Speaker 1>So I knew the requirement of it.</v>

9834
04:44:20.481 --> 04:44:21.150
<v Speaker 1>But until you,</v>

9835
04:44:21.150 --> 04:44:25.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Piss ass amount of training that I was doing in comparison to what it</v>

9836
04:44:25.431 --> 04:44:27.100
<v Speaker 1>is to fight in the UFC or something like that.</v>

9837
04:44:27.101 --> 04:44:29.900
<v Speaker 1>And it just gave me way more of a,</v>

9838
04:44:29.910 --> 04:44:31.340
<v Speaker 1>an appreciation for just how much,</v>

9839
04:44:31.400 --> 04:44:35.870
<v Speaker 1>how much it takes out of your life because it's not just the amount of time that</v>

9840
04:44:35.871 --> 04:44:36.651
<v Speaker 1>you're spent training.</v>

9841
04:44:36.651 --> 04:44:41.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you're done training your fucking tired and you're not going to</v>

9842
04:44:41.211 --> 04:44:44.210
<v Speaker 1>get a lot of other things done and if you do you're going to be cranky.</v>

9843
04:44:44.510 --> 04:44:45.343
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

9844
04:44:45.600 --> 04:44:46.433
<v Speaker 1>Any help.</v>

9845
04:44:46.520 --> 04:44:49.980
<v Speaker 1>So that was the story behind it and he just decided not to do it apparently.</v>

9846
04:44:49.981 --> 04:44:52.860
<v Speaker 1>And when it became more obvious that they didn't want money,</v>

9847
04:44:52.861 --> 04:44:53.970
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to put them in jail,</v>

9848
04:44:54.240 --> 04:44:56.160
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to put them in jail and set an example.</v>

9849
04:44:56.460 --> 04:44:59.220
<v Speaker 1>I think this was all while his court case was still going on.</v>

9850
04:44:59.221 --> 04:45:03.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to talk out of school cause I don't know what the exact issue was,</v>

9851
04:45:03.361 --> 04:45:07.560
<v Speaker 1>but they want to putting them in jail for tax evasion because he had some guy</v>

9852
04:45:07.561 --> 04:45:12.561
<v Speaker 1>who apparently was advising him incorrectly about how much taxes he had to pay</v>

9853
04:45:12.600 --> 04:45:14.700
<v Speaker 1>or whether or not he had to pay taxes at all.</v>

9854
04:45:14.701 --> 04:45:15.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the whole story,</v>

9855
04:45:16.530 --> 04:45:17.190
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

9856
04:45:17.190 --> 04:45:18.120
<v Speaker 1>that was what was going on.</v>

9857
04:45:18.121 --> 04:45:19.440
<v Speaker 1>He was just in desperation mode.</v>

9858
04:45:20.070 --> 04:45:20.580
<v Speaker 1>I thought it,</v>

9859
04:45:20.580 --> 04:45:21.960
<v Speaker 1>I always thought that was a rumor.</v>

9860
04:45:22.200 --> 04:45:23.033
<v Speaker 1>Now there was real,</v>

9861
04:45:23.040 --> 04:45:23.461
<v Speaker 1>I remember,</v>

9862
04:45:23.461 --> 04:45:27.030
<v Speaker 1>I remember you mentioning it on a broadcast who went because he wouldn't sign</v>

9863
04:45:27.031 --> 04:45:29.730
<v Speaker 1>the contract because it was going on for a long time.</v>

9864
04:45:29.731 --> 04:45:30.211
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

9865
04:45:30.211 --> 04:45:31.044
<v Speaker 1>what are we doing?</v>

9866
04:45:31.650 --> 04:45:32.160
<v Speaker 1>Like am I,</v>

9867
04:45:32.160 --> 04:45:33.780
<v Speaker 1>am I doing this because if I'm doing this,</v>

9868
04:45:33.781 --> 04:45:34.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing anything else.</v>

9869
04:45:34.890 --> 04:45:36.180
<v Speaker 1>Like I need to know if I'm doing this.</v>

9870
04:45:36.780 --> 04:45:37.920
<v Speaker 1>And I was training a lot then.</v>

9871
04:45:37.950 --> 04:45:38.461
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

9872
04:45:38.461 --> 04:45:39.250
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

9873
04:45:39.250 --> 04:45:40.620
<v Speaker 1>see now you're getting pissed.</v>

9874
04:45:40.680 --> 04:45:43.290
<v Speaker 1>Because I was getting pissed at a certain point in time,</v>

9875
04:45:43.291 --> 04:45:43.710
<v Speaker 1>but I was,</v>

9876
04:45:43.710 --> 04:45:44.790
<v Speaker 1>that was when,</v>

9877
04:45:44.820 --> 04:45:45.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9878
04:45:45.390 --> 04:45:49.950
<v Speaker 1>I was training Jujitsu a lot and I was training several times a week.</v>

9879
04:45:50.070 --> 04:45:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

9880
04:45:50.580 --> 04:45:52.950
<v Speaker 1>He might have fucked me up totally possible,</v>

9881
04:45:53.280 --> 04:45:55.290
<v Speaker 1>but I was pretty sure I was going to choke him.</v>

9882
04:45:55.700 --> 04:45:58.440
<v Speaker 1>It was just one of those things where it's like,</v>

9883
04:45:58.500 --> 04:46:00.620
<v Speaker 1>if it was like Michael Jai white or something like that,</v>

9884
04:46:00.621 --> 04:46:00.901
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

9885
04:46:00.901 --> 04:46:01.734
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>

9886
04:46:02.760 --> 04:46:03.060

9888
04:46:04.531 --> 04:46:05.364
<v Speaker 1>He used to wrestle.</v>

9889
04:46:05.490 --> 04:46:06.323
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>

9890

<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

9894
04:46:11.100 --> 04:46:14.730
<v Speaker 1>We just feel like it's only so much you can do,</v>

04:46:18.090 --> 04:46:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the first time you got mauled and in like a Jujitsu class?</v>

9898
04:46:21.900 --> 04:46:22.733
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

9899
04:46:23.100 --> 04:46:24.090
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it weird?</v>

9900
04:46:24.540 --> 04:46:26.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like the first time you get mauled you like,</v>

9901
04:46:26.130 --> 04:46:27.900
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea someone could do that to me.</v>

9902
04:46:27.901 --> 04:46:28.734
<v Speaker 1>So easy.</v>

9903
04:46:29.220 --> 04:46:29.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

9904
04:46:29.431 --> 04:46:30.290

9905
04:46:30.310 --> 04:46:33.570
<v Speaker 1>I was like 18 I got choked by a 14 year old.</v>

9906
04:46:35.400 --> 04:46:36.233
<v Speaker 1>I'm serious.</v>

9907
04:46:36.780 --> 04:46:37.613
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

9908
04:46:39.690 --> 04:46:40.800
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what I was doing.</v>

9909
04:46:40.930 --> 04:46:41.763
<v Speaker 1>Course,</v>

9910
04:46:42.360 --> 04:46:45.180
<v Speaker 1>there was a kid at Carlson Gracie's place that used to torture me.</v>

9911
04:46:45.960 --> 04:46:50.090
<v Speaker 1>I was a white belt and he was a purple belt and he was no bigger than me who's</v>

9912
04:46:50.100 --> 04:46:51.060
<v Speaker 1>no younger than me.</v>

9913
04:46:51.210 --> 04:46:52.230
<v Speaker 1>He was like my age,</v>

9914
04:46:52.231 --> 04:46:52.921
<v Speaker 1>my size,</v>

9915
04:46:52.921 --> 04:46:55.020
<v Speaker 1>and used to just rape me.</v>

9916
04:46:55.610 --> 04:46:55.940
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

9917
04:46:55.940 --> 04:46:58.830
<v Speaker 1>there's just no denying that this dude,</v>

9918
04:46:59.100 --> 04:47:00.330
<v Speaker 1>if we were in a fight,</v>

9919
04:47:00.360 --> 04:47:03.870
<v Speaker 1>he would be able to choke the fucking life out of me and I would only be able to</v>

9920
04:47:03.871 --> 04:47:05.880
<v Speaker 1>hold them off for a certain amount of time.</v>

9921
04:47:06.420 --> 04:47:06.900
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>

9922
04:47:06.900 --> 04:47:07.561
<v Speaker 1>I was a white belt.</v>

9923
04:47:07.561 --> 04:47:10.020
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what I was doing and he wasn't nice about it either.</v>

9924
04:47:10.320 --> 04:47:11.790
<v Speaker 1>He was smash you,</v>

9925
04:47:12.450 --> 04:47:14.840
<v Speaker 1>but that guy taught me a lot of,</v>

9926
04:47:15.030 --> 04:47:19.710
<v Speaker 1>it taught me a lot because I wrestled in high school and I'd done a lot of a</v>

9927
04:47:19.740 --> 04:47:22.920
<v Speaker 1>martial arts tournaments as far as like taekwondo tournaments and had done some</v>

9928
04:47:22.921 --> 04:47:27.921
<v Speaker 1>of that American kickboxing and I had a totally delusional sense of how much I</v>

9929
04:47:28.321 --> 04:47:29.760
<v Speaker 1>could keep someone off of me.</v>

9930
04:47:30.060 --> 04:47:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Like in terms of grappling.</v>

9931
04:47:31.390 --> 04:47:31.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

9932
04:47:31.560 --> 04:47:32.910
<v Speaker 1>I really had no idea.</v>

9933
04:47:33.690 --> 04:47:35.370
<v Speaker 1>It was just so humiliating.</v>

9934
04:47:37.530 --> 04:47:38.363
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows.</v>

9935
04:47:38.370 --> 04:47:38.821
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows.</v>

9936
04:47:38.821 --> 04:47:39.450
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows.</v>

9937
04:47:39.450 --> 04:47:41.400
<v Speaker 1>They don't know any grappling,</v>

9938
04:47:41.401 --> 04:47:41.881
<v Speaker 1>striking,</v>

9939
04:47:41.881 --> 04:47:44.400
<v Speaker 1>whatever it has like this false sense of security.</v>

9940
04:47:45.090 --> 04:47:46.630
<v Speaker 1>I had to tell that to a friend of mine.</v>

9941
04:47:47.530 --> 04:47:49.510
<v Speaker 1>I had to tell that to a friend of mine who was a grappler.</v>

9942
04:47:49.740 --> 04:47:52.300
<v Speaker 1>I had a buddy of mine who have really good guy,</v>

9943
04:47:52.480 --> 04:47:53.490
<v Speaker 1>his black belt in Jujitsu.</v>

9944
04:47:53.500 --> 04:47:53.711
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

9945
04:47:53.711 --> 04:47:55.690
<v Speaker 1>am I taking them and may fight like,</v>

9946
04:47:55.780 --> 04:47:56.613
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

9947
04:47:56.650 --> 04:47:58.230
<v Speaker 1>like why are you going to take an MMA fight?</v>

9948
04:47:58.280 --> 04:47:58.541
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

9949
04:47:58.541 --> 04:47:58.871
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

9950
04:47:58.871 --> 04:47:59.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9951
04:47:59.291 --> 04:48:00.400
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a bucket list thing.</v>

9952
04:48:00.401 --> 04:48:00.851
<v Speaker 1>I want to do it.</v>

9953
04:48:00.851 --> 04:48:00.991
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

9954
04:48:00.991 --> 04:48:01.840
<v Speaker 1>you're to dabble in this.</v>

9955
04:48:01.841 --> 04:48:02.651
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to compete?</v>

9956
04:48:02.651 --> 04:48:03.484
<v Speaker 1>You're going to fight.</v>

9957
04:48:03.640 --> 04:48:06.280
<v Speaker 1>Like we had these one of these conversations like how are you going to do this?</v>

9958
04:48:06.640 --> 04:48:07.090
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

9959
04:48:07.090 --> 04:48:09.550
<v Speaker 1>you know what you can do to a guy because he's a black belt.</v>

9960
04:48:09.580 --> 04:48:09.701
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

9961
04:48:09.701 --> 04:48:11.860
<v Speaker 1>You know what you could do to a guy on the ground that doesn't know what the</v>

9962
04:48:11.861 --> 04:48:12.694
<v Speaker 1>fuck he's doing.</v>

9963
04:48:13.030 --> 04:48:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Someone could do that to you standing up and it's way worse.</v>

9964
04:48:17.260 --> 04:48:19.440
<v Speaker 1>It's way worse because if a guy takes you down,</v>

9965
04:48:19.480 --> 04:48:20.051
<v Speaker 1>strangles you,</v>

9966
04:48:20.051 --> 04:48:20.651
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>

9967
04:48:20.651 --> 04:48:21.910
<v Speaker 1>You tap you like you get up,</v>

9968
04:48:21.911 --> 04:48:22.990
<v Speaker 1>your neck is a little sore,</v>

9969
04:48:23.140 --> 04:48:24.760
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be fine and go to work.</v>

9970
04:48:24.761 --> 04:48:25.594
<v Speaker 1>The next tab,</v>

9971
04:48:25.650 --> 04:48:28.090
<v Speaker 1>if eve Edwards Shins you across the Dome,</v>

9972
04:48:28.300 --> 04:48:29.620
<v Speaker 1>that's not a fun time.</v>

9973
04:48:30.040 --> 04:48:33.730
<v Speaker 1>That's not a fun time and your legs turn into rubber and they give out from you</v>

9974
04:48:33.731 --> 04:48:36.040
<v Speaker 1>and the world's spinning and you here.</v>

9975
04:48:41.020 --> 04:48:42.210
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>

9976
04:48:42.520 --> 04:48:43.560
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly right.</v>

9977
04:48:43.561 --> 04:48:44.394
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible.</v>

9978
04:48:44.730 --> 04:48:46.080
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible place to be,</v>

9979
04:48:46.380 --> 04:48:47.213
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

9980
04:48:47.220 --> 04:48:47.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

9981
04:48:47.880 --> 04:48:50.940
<v Speaker 1>It's just one of those things that I don't think people realize until they see</v>

9982
04:48:50.941 --> 04:48:53.730
<v Speaker 1>it happen or until they do it to somebody like it.</v>

9983
04:48:53.731 --> 04:48:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Since they can't do it to somebody that I don't think they realize that someone</v>

9984
04:48:56.401 --> 04:48:57.234
<v Speaker 1>could do it to them.</v>

9985
04:48:58.350 --> 04:48:59.250
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody,</v>

9986
04:48:59.370 --> 04:49:02.370
<v Speaker 1>everybody should at least once every man anyway,</v>

9987
04:49:02.490 --> 04:49:04.800
<v Speaker 1>once in their lifetime here.</v>

9988
04:49:04.801 --> 04:49:05.830
<v Speaker 1>That yeah.</v>

9989
04:49:07.400 --> 04:49:08.150
<v Speaker 14>Feel it.</v>

9990
04:49:08.150 --> 04:49:10.160
<v Speaker 1>Cause that that's a different state of play.</v>

9991
04:49:10.680 --> 04:49:12.170
<v Speaker 1>It's just like a car accident.</v>

9992
04:49:12.200 --> 04:49:12.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

9993
04:49:12.350 --> 04:49:14.380
<v Speaker 1>People don't realize it when they get in the car accident.</v>

9994
04:49:14.440 --> 04:49:16.640
<v Speaker 1>It's same like buzz,</v>

9995
04:49:17.070 --> 04:49:17.930
<v Speaker 1>like when you see,</v>

9996
04:49:17.931 --> 04:49:19.130
<v Speaker 1>when you see those films,</v>

9997
04:49:19.131 --> 04:49:20.840
<v Speaker 1>if you've never experienced that,</v>

9998
04:49:20.841 --> 04:49:24.080
<v Speaker 1>when you see those films where as a car accident or a big hit and they,</v>

9999
04:49:24.081 --> 04:49:25.700
<v Speaker 1>they do that effect,</v>

10000
04:49:25.940 --> 04:49:27.380
<v Speaker 1>just imagine all of that,</v>

10001
04:49:27.381 --> 04:49:29.000
<v Speaker 1>but inside your own head,</v>

10002
04:49:29.180 --> 04:49:33.380
<v Speaker 1>it's really just like that for about two to three seconds as it clears up.</v>

10003
04:49:34.280 --> 04:49:39.280
<v Speaker 1>I remember when Tito Ortiz Body slammed Evan Tanner and k Odom with a body slam.</v>

10004
04:49:41.120 --> 04:49:41.691
<v Speaker 1>I remember,</v>

10005
04:49:41.691 --> 04:49:42.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10006
04:49:42.320 --> 04:49:43.520
<v Speaker 1>just watching that,</v>

10007
04:49:43.640 --> 04:49:45.050
<v Speaker 1>how he got the clench on him,</v>

10008
04:49:45.230 --> 04:49:48.380
<v Speaker 1>hoisted him up in the air and just slammed him to the ground.</v>

10009
04:49:48.800 --> 04:49:50.420
<v Speaker 1>And I remember thinking like,</v>

10010
04:49:50.750 --> 04:49:55.750
<v Speaker 1>so few people understand that a guy like Dan can just do that to you.</v>

10011
04:49:57.080 --> 04:49:57.913
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

10012
04:49:58.320 --> 04:49:59.600
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that on the street.</v>

10013
04:49:59.840 --> 04:50:00.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

10014
04:50:00.711 --> 04:50:01.940
<v Speaker 1>Right in front of a Bodega.</v>

10015
04:50:02.630 --> 04:50:04.820
<v Speaker 1>Just slams you on a fire hydrant like that.</v>

10016
04:50:05.350 --> 04:50:05.530
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

10017
04:50:05.530 --> 04:50:06.363
<v Speaker 1>here it is right here.</v>

10018
04:50:06.620 --> 04:50:07.550
<v Speaker 1>He got the body clench.</v>

10019
04:50:07.630 --> 04:50:08.550
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

10020
04:50:09.440 --> 04:50:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Just Kayonin with a slam.</v>

10021
04:50:11.870 --> 04:50:14.330
<v Speaker 1>That was when Tito was in his full prime.</v>

10022
04:50:15.530 --> 04:50:15.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

10023
04:50:15.950 --> 04:50:16.740
<v Speaker 1>seeing that a,</v>

10024
04:50:16.740 --> 04:50:17.930
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't that happen more often.</v>

10025
04:50:17.931 --> 04:50:19.400
<v Speaker 1>That seems like the guys are better.</v>

10026
04:50:20.120 --> 04:50:20.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

10027
04:50:20.730 --> 04:50:21.563
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

10028
04:50:22.430 --> 04:50:23.263
<v Speaker 1>guys are better.</v>

10029
04:50:23.370 --> 04:50:27.020
<v Speaker 1>They're better at adjusting on the way down to the guys are realizing the</v>

10030
04:50:27.021 --> 04:50:29.150
<v Speaker 1>consequences of that head getting into play.</v>

10031
04:50:29.450 --> 04:50:33.350
<v Speaker 1>They're protecting themselves because a lot of it is in the body slam.</v>

10032
04:50:33.380 --> 04:50:34.700
<v Speaker 1>You're also getting headbutted,</v>

10033
04:50:35.200 --> 04:50:36.033
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

10034
04:50:36.060 --> 04:50:36.680
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

10035
04:50:36.680 --> 04:50:37.160
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>

10036
04:50:37.160 --> 04:50:38.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember who it was happen.</v>

10037
04:50:39.280 --> 04:50:43.190
<v Speaker 1>It was around the turn of the Millennia,</v>

10038
04:50:43.940 --> 04:50:44.151
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

10039
04:50:44.151 --> 04:50:44.660
<v Speaker 1>Millennia.</v>

10040
04:50:44.660 --> 04:50:45.530
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

10041
04:50:45.800 --> 04:50:46.370
<v Speaker 1>somebody</v>

10042
04:50:46.370 --> 04:50:50.930
<v Speaker 13>got picked up in that body body lock and they were dumping them and they posted.</v>

10043
04:50:51.020 --> 04:50:51.920
<v Speaker 13>Do you remember this?</v>

10044
04:50:52.450 --> 04:50:56.170
<v Speaker 13>I feel like it was Jason de Lucia posted,</v>

10045
04:50:56.180 --> 04:50:57.200
<v Speaker 13>snapped his arm,</v>

10046
04:50:57.650 --> 04:51:01.130
<v Speaker 13>no posted on his foot and it's close to on his leg.</v>

10047
04:51:01.930 --> 04:51:02.480
<v Speaker 13>Uh,</v>

10048
04:51:02.480 --> 04:51:03.960
<v Speaker 13>if somebody remembers that I,</v>

10049
04:51:03.961 --> 04:51:04.761
<v Speaker 13>if I find it,</v>

10050
04:51:04.761 --> 04:51:05.421
<v Speaker 13>I'll send it to you.</v>

10051
04:51:05.421 --> 04:51:10.100
<v Speaker 13>But I feel like somebody's got body locked and he got picked up with that same</v>

10052
04:51:10.101 --> 04:51:11.300
<v Speaker 13>slam that Tito tried to hit with.</v>

10053
04:51:11.301 --> 04:51:12.740
<v Speaker 13>Just hit on at Hannah.</v>

10054
04:51:13.160 --> 04:51:14.720
<v Speaker 13>And as he tilted his feet,</v>

10055
04:51:14.960 --> 04:51:16.510
<v Speaker 13>let's flipped his feet over his head,</v>

10056
04:51:16.520 --> 04:51:17.570
<v Speaker 13>getting Sam this way,</v>

10057
04:51:17.571 --> 04:51:18.404
<v Speaker 13>but he reached,</v>

10058
04:51:18.410 --> 04:51:19.520
<v Speaker 13>reaches out with his leg,</v>

10059
04:51:20.250 --> 04:51:21.230
<v Speaker 13>stopped himself.</v>

10060
04:51:22.360 --> 04:51:23.193
<v Speaker 13>I want to serve.</v>

10061
04:51:23.710 --> 04:51:24.230
<v Speaker 13>Huh?</v>

10062
04:51:24.230 --> 04:51:24.921
<v Speaker 13>I can't remember.</v>

10063
04:51:24.921 --> 04:51:27.020
<v Speaker 13>I only saw it once cause I'm not looking at that again.</v>

10064
04:51:27.530 --> 04:51:28.363
<v Speaker 13>But it was,</v>

10065
04:51:29.390 --> 04:51:29.770
<v Speaker 13>yeah,</v>

10066
04:51:29.770 --> 04:51:30.603
<v Speaker 13>it was bad.</v>

10067
04:51:30.950 --> 04:51:32.620
<v Speaker 13>It was like he's dislocated his hip,</v>

10068
04:51:32.630 --> 04:51:33.360
<v Speaker 13>which some thought,</v>

10069
04:51:33.360 --> 04:51:33.740
<v Speaker 13>Jeez,</v>

10070
04:51:33.740 --> 04:51:35.450
<v Speaker 13>I feel like it was Jason de Lucia.</v>

10071
04:51:36.570 --> 04:51:37.670
<v Speaker 13>I don't remember for sure.</v>

10072
04:51:37.700 --> 04:51:38.840
<v Speaker 13>Now that you're bringing it up,</v>

10073
04:51:38.841 --> 04:51:40.640
<v Speaker 13>I have this fucking shaky memory.</v>

10074
04:51:40.641 --> 04:51:44.990
<v Speaker 13>That might just be you introducing a false memory into my head too.</v>

10075
04:51:45.020 --> 04:51:46.490
<v Speaker 13>They say the FBI does to people.</v>

10076
04:51:48.620 --> 04:51:50.270
<v Speaker 13>False false memories.</v>

10077
04:51:50.330 --> 04:51:51.230
<v Speaker 13>They can do that now.</v>

10078
04:51:51.700 --> 04:51:52.521
<v Speaker 13>Where are you there,</v>

10079
04:51:52.521 --> 04:51:53.240
<v Speaker 13>Joe Rogan?</v>

10080
04:51:53.240 --> 04:51:54.400
<v Speaker 13>I don't know man.</v>

10081
04:51:54.720 --> 04:51:55.030
<v Speaker 13>I know,</v>

04:51:55.030 --> 04:51:55.250
<v Speaker 13>man.</v>

04:51:55.250 --> 04:51:55.851
<v Speaker 13>You tell me,</v>

10084
04:51:55.851 --> 04:51:56.684
<v Speaker 13>man.</v>

10085
04:51:56.940 --> 04:51:58.400
<v Speaker 13>I'm getting fucking confused.</v>

10086
04:51:59.470 --> 04:52:00.303
<v Speaker 13>Yeah,</v>

10087
04:52:00.440 --> 04:52:00.800
<v Speaker 13>we've been,</v>

10088
04:52:00.800 --> 04:52:02.210
<v Speaker 13>we've seen a lot of people get fucked up.</v>

10089
04:52:02.250 --> 04:52:02.900
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

10090
04:52:02.900 --> 04:52:03.733
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

10091
04:52:04.010 --> 04:52:05.120
<v Speaker 13>I think about it.</v>

10092
04:52:05.121 --> 04:52:07.240
<v Speaker 13>I asked my wife one time how many fight she's seen.</v>

10093
04:52:07.250 --> 04:52:10.670
<v Speaker 13>I can only imagine how many fights you've seen seen a lot of fights.</v>

10094
04:52:11.390 --> 04:52:16.390
<v Speaker 13>What's interesting is you and I have seen fights from the beginning to the,</v>

10095
04:52:17.360 --> 04:52:19.140
<v Speaker 13>obviously the most recent errors,</v>

10096
04:52:19.170 --> 04:52:20.900
<v Speaker 13>almost always the best era in every sport.</v>

10097
04:52:20.901 --> 04:52:21.270
<v Speaker 13>Right?</v>

10098
04:52:21.270 --> 04:52:21.740
<v Speaker 13>Right.</v>

10099
04:52:21.740 --> 04:52:23.240
<v Speaker 13>But this is the best era.</v>

10100
04:52:23.300 --> 04:52:23.951
<v Speaker 13>I mean the,</v>

10101
04:52:23.951 --> 04:52:24.131
<v Speaker 13>the,</v>

10102
04:52:24.131 --> 04:52:28.130
<v Speaker 13>the elite athletes of today are probably the best of all time,</v>

10103
04:52:28.520 --> 04:52:28.970
<v Speaker 13>right?</v>

10104
04:52:28.970 --> 04:52:29.530
<v Speaker 13>Yeah.</v>

10105
04:52:29.530 --> 04:52:29.770
<v Speaker 13>I,</v>

10106
04:52:29.770 --> 04:52:34.770
<v Speaker 13>I watch watch UFC broadcasts at home and I feel like I'm watching.</v>

10107
04:52:36.290 --> 04:52:39.440
<v Speaker 13>I didn't think I'd be watching this on television in the capacity that I'm</v>

10108
04:52:39.441 --> 04:52:41.180
<v Speaker 13>watching it now that I can see it in now.</v>

10109
04:52:41.180 --> 04:52:42.320
<v Speaker 13>Like these guys,</v>

10110
04:52:42.321 --> 04:52:43.370
<v Speaker 13>I see the fight,</v>

10111
04:52:43.400 --> 04:52:48.400
<v Speaker 13>I see these guys into the octagon and it's like I'm watching the NBA in the,</v>

10112
04:52:48.840 --> 04:52:53.720
<v Speaker 13>in the nineties early nineties or I'm watching the NFL and other early in the</v>

10113
04:52:53.720 --> 04:52:54.051
<v Speaker 13>mid nineties you know,</v>

10114
04:52:54.051 --> 04:52:55.160
<v Speaker 13>it's like this is,</v>

10115
04:52:55.190 --> 04:52:59.450
<v Speaker 13>this is becoming something that is a real sport.</v>

10116
04:52:59.451 --> 04:52:59.661
<v Speaker 13>It's,</v>

10117
04:52:59.661 --> 04:53:03.920
<v Speaker 13>it's the UFC is a league and this is a real sport that people actually respect</v>

10118
04:53:03.921 --> 04:53:06.320
<v Speaker 13>and this is going to be become a part of the culture.</v>

10119
04:53:06.500 --> 04:53:06.890
<v Speaker 13>You know,</v>

10120
04:53:06.890 --> 04:53:07.461
<v Speaker 13>people are going to,</v>

10121
04:53:07.461 --> 04:53:09.650
<v Speaker 13>their kids are gonna grow up to do these things.</v>

10122
04:53:10.130 --> 04:53:10.760
<v Speaker 13>For sure.</v>

10123
04:53:10.760 --> 04:53:11.800
<v Speaker 13>I didn't think I would see.</v>

10124
04:53:11.820 --> 04:53:12.350
<v Speaker 13>I didn't,</v>

10125
04:53:12.350 --> 04:53:15.830
<v Speaker 13>I didn't expect no who expected this at this point even,</v>

10126
04:53:15.860 --> 04:53:16.341
<v Speaker 13>I mean,</v>

10127
04:53:16.341 --> 04:53:16.820
<v Speaker 13>right.</v>

10128
04:53:16.820 --> 04:53:17.660
<v Speaker 13>I thought it was exciting.</v>

10129
04:53:17.661 --> 04:53:18.890
<v Speaker 13>I thought it was going to go somewhere,</v>

10130
04:53:18.891 --> 04:53:20.810
<v Speaker 13>but I didn't think he was going to be this quick.</v>

10131
04:53:21.440 --> 04:53:21.561
<v Speaker 13>No,</v>

10132
04:53:21.561 --> 04:53:22.394
<v Speaker 13>you're totally right.</v>

10133
04:53:22.880 --> 04:53:23.660
<v Speaker 13>It's amazing.</v>

10134
04:53:23.660 --> 04:53:24.021
<v Speaker 13>I mean,</v>

10135
04:53:24.021 --> 04:53:27.590
<v Speaker 13>and that's because the balls or the Fertittas cough up all that cash,</v>

10136
04:53:27.950 --> 04:53:28.311
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

10137
04:53:28.311 --> 04:53:32.000
<v Speaker 13>get $44 million in the hole and sticking with it and then eventually the</v>

10138
04:53:32.001 --> 04:53:36.080
<v Speaker 13>ultimate fighter finale airs and Stephan Bonner and Forrest Griffin put on that</v>

10139
04:53:36.081 --> 04:53:38.450
<v Speaker 13>crazy show and then it all springs from there.</v>

10140
04:53:38.660 --> 04:53:40.480
<v Speaker 13>It's pretty incredible that you're,</v>

10141
04:53:40.610 --> 04:53:42.530
<v Speaker 13>you're looking at today,</v>

10142
04:53:42.560 --> 04:53:42.990
<v Speaker 13>you know,</v>

10143
04:53:42.990 --> 04:53:44.010
<v Speaker 13>major events on</v>

10144
04:53:44.010 --> 04:53:44.843
<v Speaker 1>Fox.</v>

10145
04:53:45.240 --> 04:53:46.200
<v Speaker 1>That's giant.</v>

10146
04:53:46.230 --> 04:53:46.951
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're huge.</v>

10147
04:53:46.951 --> 04:53:48.480
<v Speaker 1>They get millions and millions of people,</v>

10148
04:53:48.510 --> 04:53:52.020
<v Speaker 1>giant paper views and then Connor and Rhonda,</v>

10149
04:53:52.050 --> 04:53:56.580
<v Speaker 1>these two huge stars that have sort of transcended the sport and they become</v>

10150
04:53:56.581 --> 04:54:01.200
<v Speaker 1>these pulp pulp fiction like icons,</v>

10151
04:54:01.201 --> 04:54:02.040
<v Speaker 1>these characters,</v>

10152
04:54:02.041 --> 04:54:04.230
<v Speaker 1>he's pop fiction humans.</v>

10153
04:54:04.620 --> 04:54:09.620
<v Speaker 1>They become like something exaggerated when when the UFC had to move,</v>

10154
04:54:11.010 --> 04:54:13.110
<v Speaker 1>when they got banned in New York,</v>

10155
04:54:13.160 --> 04:54:14.520
<v Speaker 1>I had to move the event.</v>

10156
04:54:14.521 --> 04:54:16.640
<v Speaker 1>You can look in the backstage reporting.</v>

10157
04:54:16.660 --> 04:54:17.760
<v Speaker 1>That was my first one.</v>

10158
04:54:18.180 --> 04:54:18.601
<v Speaker 1>Dothan,</v>

10159
04:54:18.601 --> 04:54:19.081
<v Speaker 1>Alabama.</v>

10160
04:54:19.081 --> 04:54:21.060
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know if I was going to have to fly to Buffalo,</v>

10161
04:54:21.061 --> 04:54:22.020
<v Speaker 1>New York or Dothan,</v>

10162
04:54:22.021 --> 04:54:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Alabama last minute.</v>

10163
04:54:23.551 --> 04:54:24.384
<v Speaker 1>It was Dothan.</v>

10164
04:54:24.770 --> 04:54:25.610
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>

10165
04:54:26.040 --> 04:54:30.510
<v Speaker 1>this is just a while ago and now it's like Madison Square Gardens.</v>

10166
04:54:30.511 --> 04:54:30.631
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

10167
04:54:30.631 --> 04:54:31.800
<v Speaker 1>That was 19 years ago.</v>

10168
04:54:32.130 --> 04:54:34.770
<v Speaker 1>Those 97 crazy.</v>

10169
04:54:34.980 --> 04:54:35.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

10170
04:54:35.281 --> 04:54:39.060
<v Speaker 1>Now it's in Madison Square garden with the fucking Nadine has card of assassins</v>

10171
04:54:39.300 --> 04:54:40.530
<v Speaker 1>that's ever been put together.</v>

10172
04:54:40.590 --> 04:54:45.590
<v Speaker 1>There's no better example of the fight game at a being at its highest level now</v>

10173
04:54:46.771 --> 04:54:47.604
<v Speaker 1>than that card.</v>

10174
04:54:47.810 --> 04:54:48.630
<v Speaker 1>Like that car.</v>

10175
04:54:48.630 --> 04:54:48.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

10176
04:54:48.840 --> 04:54:50.240
<v Speaker 1>look at all the killers on that card.</v>

10177
04:54:50.560 --> 04:54:52.470
<v Speaker 1>It was just chaos.</v>

10178
04:54:52.471 --> 04:54:53.011
<v Speaker 1>The whole car.</v>

10179
04:54:53.011 --> 04:54:55.530
<v Speaker 1>It's just chaos from top to bottom.</v>

10180
04:54:55.650 --> 04:54:59.010
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of guides you you can get by without watching a fight,</v>

10181
04:54:59.070 --> 04:55:01.410
<v Speaker 1>but there's not one on there that I don't add.</v>

10182
04:55:02.070 --> 04:55:02.940
<v Speaker 1>I want to miss.</v>

10183
04:55:03.000 --> 04:55:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

10184
04:55:03.630 --> 04:55:03.811
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

10185
04:55:03.811 --> 04:55:04.531
<v Speaker 1>it's a nutty card.</v>

10186
04:55:04.531 --> 04:55:09.000
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like show up at a chick's house the first time you bring diamonds</v>

10187
04:55:09.001 --> 04:55:12.120
<v Speaker 1>and roses and chocolate and champagne.</v>

10188
04:55:12.630 --> 04:55:14.250
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck you going to do the second time?</v>

10189
04:55:14.620 --> 04:55:15.900
<v Speaker 1>Just bring your dirty deck.</v>

10190
04:55:17.670 --> 04:55:18.270
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

10191
04:55:18.270 --> 04:55:18.661
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>

10192
04:55:18.661 --> 04:55:19.740
<v Speaker 1>All the fucking diamonds.</v>

10193
04:55:19.741 --> 04:55:20.101
<v Speaker 1>Bitch.</v>

10194
04:55:20.101 --> 04:55:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Where's the champagne?</v>

10195
04:55:20.941 --> 04:55:23.940
<v Speaker 1>Like you almost can't make this card again.</v>

10196
04:55:24.160 --> 04:55:24.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

10197
04:55:24.690 --> 04:55:25.220
<v Speaker 1>This card.</v>

10198
04:55:25.220 --> 04:55:27.420
<v Speaker 1>So the next time we're in Madison Square Garden,</v>

10199
04:55:27.421 --> 04:55:28.111
<v Speaker 1>people are going to be like,</v>

10200
04:55:28.111 --> 04:55:32.940
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this cat fucking cods bullshit.</v>

10201
04:55:33.270 --> 04:55:34.350
<v Speaker 1>Last time they were here.</v>

10202
04:55:34.351 --> 04:55:38.490
<v Speaker 1>We had three title fights plus Ramiro bashed his white men.</v>

10203
04:55:38.490 --> 04:55:39.450
<v Speaker 1>We had that guest,</v>

10204
04:55:39.451 --> 04:55:41.370
<v Speaker 1>Dillon Francis Cowboy.</v>

10205
04:55:42.300 --> 04:55:43.470
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be horrible.</v>

10206
04:55:43.471 --> 04:55:44.640
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be horrible.</v>

10207
04:55:44.641 --> 04:55:47.370
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be just like a girl that thinks you're tired of fucking her.</v>

10208
04:55:47.730 --> 04:55:48.031
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>

10209
04:55:48.031 --> 04:55:48.900
<v Speaker 1>The same thing.</v>

10210
04:55:48.930 --> 04:55:49.111
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

10211
04:55:49.111 --> 04:55:50.490
<v Speaker 1>you think you're just going to come over now?</v>

10212
04:55:50.491 --> 04:55:50.760
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

10213
04:55:50.760 --> 04:55:51.860
<v Speaker 1>You don't even have to bring diamonds.</v>

10214
04:55:51.861 --> 04:55:53.610
<v Speaker 1>Is that going to be like a once a year thing?</v>

10215
04:55:55.110 --> 04:55:56.350
<v Speaker 1>I think Madison Square Garden,</v>

10216
04:55:56.380 --> 04:55:58.440
<v Speaker 1>we'll for sure be a once a year thing.</v>

10217
04:55:58.710 --> 04:56:00.570
<v Speaker 1>The question remains,</v>

10218
04:56:00.690 --> 04:56:04.080
<v Speaker 1>did they decide to rub it in the face of all those corrupt cock suckers that</v>

10219
04:56:04.081 --> 04:56:08.070
<v Speaker 1>kept it out in New York for so long and keep generating these gigantic super</v>

10220
04:56:08.071 --> 04:56:09.600
<v Speaker 1>mega cards in New York.</v>

10221
04:56:09.690 --> 04:56:14.400
<v Speaker 1>So it shows everybody the massive amount of revenue that it brings into the</v>

10222
04:56:14.401 --> 04:56:15.060
<v Speaker 1>city,</v>

10223
04:56:15.060 --> 04:56:17.850
<v Speaker 1>not just in the actual ticket sales itself,</v>

10224
04:56:17.851 --> 04:56:19.860
<v Speaker 1>the taxes that are generated from the merchandise,</v>

10225
04:56:19.861 --> 04:56:22.230
<v Speaker 1>but then all the affecting businesses,</v>

10226
04:56:22.231 --> 04:56:25.260
<v Speaker 1>they're going to see a boom from all these people that are leaving,</v>

10227
04:56:25.261 --> 04:56:27.030
<v Speaker 1>that are going to go to bars and restaurants,</v>

10228
04:56:27.031 --> 04:56:30.510
<v Speaker 1>and they're going to see some of the craziest shit they've ever seen in their</v>

10229
04:56:30.511 --> 04:56:30.990
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

10230
04:56:30.990 --> 04:56:33.120
<v Speaker 1>So when people see crazy shit like that,</v>

10231
04:56:33.121 --> 04:56:34.140
<v Speaker 1>they spend a lot of money,</v>

10232
04:56:34.141 --> 04:56:34.500
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

10233
04:56:34.500 --> 04:56:34.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

10234
04:56:34.740 --> 04:56:37.590
<v Speaker 1>They start drinking and fucking eating crazy food.</v>

10235
04:56:38.010 --> 04:56:40.290
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be giant financially for the city.</v>

10236
04:56:40.291 --> 04:56:45.291
<v Speaker 1>And if they decide to just throw a mega tsunami card like this one once a year,</v>

10237
04:56:45.400 --> 04:56:48.100
<v Speaker 1>that would be like they've got the other mega tsunami cards.</v>

10238
04:56:48.101 --> 04:56:48.371
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

10239
04:56:48.371 --> 04:56:50.110
<v Speaker 1>It's usually like the July 4th cards,</v>

10240
04:56:50.111 --> 04:56:55.100
<v Speaker 1>usually a giant one and December 31st card is usually a giant one soup maybe.</v>

10241
04:56:55.270 --> 04:56:55.571
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

10242
04:56:55.571 --> 04:56:57.730
<v Speaker 1>Superbowl ones usually a pretty big one too.</v>

10243
04:56:57.940 --> 04:56:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this one too.</v>

10244
04:56:59.650 --> 04:57:02.320
<v Speaker 1>But this is kind of almost to to make a point.</v>

10245
04:57:02.920 --> 04:57:03.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

10246
04:57:03.400 --> 04:57:05.740
<v Speaker 1>19 you're fucking years of corruption.</v>

10247
04:57:05.770 --> 04:57:06.730
<v Speaker 1>19 years,</v>

10248
04:57:06.940 --> 04:57:07.840
<v Speaker 1>19 years.</v>

10249
04:57:08.170 --> 04:57:09.190
<v Speaker 1>It was kept out in New York.</v>

10250
04:57:10.000 --> 04:57:11.510
<v Speaker 1>It's a long time and,</v>

10251
04:57:11.511 --> 04:57:12.090
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

10252
04:57:12.090 --> 04:57:15.490
<v Speaker 1>it's not like they didn't see the sport.</v>

10253
04:57:15.530 --> 04:57:16.910
<v Speaker 1>The sport wasn't broad gassing,</v>

10254
04:57:16.930 --> 04:57:17.131
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>

10255
04:57:17.131 --> 04:57:21.100
<v Speaker 1>the split wasn't banned from the state visually.</v>

10256
04:57:21.100 --> 04:57:22.030
<v Speaker 1>At least you know,</v>

10257
04:57:22.031 --> 04:57:22.330
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

10258
04:57:22.330 --> 04:57:25.630
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't like these people don't know what they're missing the fans.</v>

10259
04:57:25.631 --> 04:57:26.464
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

10260
04:57:27.070 --> 04:57:31.000
<v Speaker 1>you started getting a homegrown group of guys coming in behind maths area.</v>

10261
04:57:31.001 --> 04:57:31.211
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

10262
04:57:31.211 --> 04:57:32.710
<v Speaker 1>you get those long island and the guys,</v>

10263
04:57:32.711 --> 04:57:33.790
<v Speaker 1>you get why men's,</v>

10264
04:57:33.791 --> 04:57:37.750
<v Speaker 1>you get handle as guys and these guys are local and they don't get to fight at</v>

10265
04:57:37.751 --> 04:57:38.610
<v Speaker 1>home because,</v>

10266
04:57:38.800 --> 04:57:43.000
<v Speaker 1>because you have a problem with something unit corrupt and it's got millions of</v>

10267
04:57:43.001 --> 04:57:43.834
<v Speaker 1>pay per view buys.</v>

10268
04:57:44.190 --> 04:57:44.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

10269
04:57:44.400 --> 04:57:49.400
<v Speaker 1>So if you're putting on like whether it's UFC 100 or UFC 200 or two oh two oh</v>

10274
04:58:03.431 --> 04:58:04.570
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even make sense.</v>
