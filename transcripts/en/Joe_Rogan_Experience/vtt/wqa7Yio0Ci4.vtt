<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.080
<v Speaker 1>That reminds me of the first time I bought drugs.</v>

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.790
<v Speaker 1>The first time I ever bought drugs.</v>

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.370
<v Speaker 1>I met the first time about drugs.</v>

7
00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:16.371
<v Speaker 1>I was in high school and I went to a small high school so I was trying to be</v>

8
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.620
<v Speaker 1>like not make a thing to ask about it at first.</v>

9
00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:20.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

10
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.950
<v Speaker 1>cause you don't want it to get around and like be a cause.</v>

11
00:00:22.951 --> 00:00:24.330
<v Speaker 1>So you were curious.</v>

12
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:24.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

13
00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:27.690
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to try stuff but I didn't know who to ask because if you ask like at a</v>

14
00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:29.790
<v Speaker 1>small school you're like it could blow up real fast.</v>

15
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.260
<v Speaker 1>That's how guys would traveled.</v>

295
00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:39.201
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

296
00:06:39.201 --> 00:06:39.560
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

297
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.771
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

298
00:06:39.771 --> 00:06:39.981
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

299
00:06:39.981 --> 00:06:41.150
<v Speaker 1>So where we go,</v>

300
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.110
<v Speaker 1>we go to Fort Pierce,</v>

301
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:43.760
<v Speaker 1>pull it to pat Pat's and I'm like,</v>

302
00:06:43.761 --> 00:06:44.480
<v Speaker 1>God damn it.</v>

303
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.280
<v Speaker 1>And like she remembered how to get there.</v>

304
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:46.701
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

305
00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Steve had started going there all the time.</v>

306
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

307
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.640
<v Speaker 1>We pulled up to his trailer this time he gets out now this time I'm like,</v>

308
00:06:52.641 --> 00:06:53.460
<v Speaker 1>well they're friends.</v>

309
00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.700
<v Speaker 1>This is probably gonna be a much quicker thing.</v>

310
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:56.301
<v Speaker 1>He comes out,</v>

311
00:06:56.301 --> 00:06:57.560
<v Speaker 1>he jumps in the back and he's like,</v>

312
00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:57.981
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

313
00:06:57.981 --> 00:06:58.461
<v Speaker 1>let's roll.</v>

314
00:06:58.461 --> 00:06:58.940
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

315
00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:59.420
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

316
00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.990
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

317
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.290
<v Speaker 1>like fucking look for a sack again.</v>

318
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Like I thought you just have this.</v>

319
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.090
<v Speaker 1>So this time we went to this,</v>

320
00:07:08.091 --> 00:07:10.790
<v Speaker 1>but these are things [inaudible] scared the shit out of me the first time.</v>

321
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:15.260
<v Speaker 1>But that second time he saved our life actually because we went from his trailer</v>

322
00:07:15.261 --> 00:07:17.150
<v Speaker 1>the second time where he jumped in the back,</v>

323
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.380
<v Speaker 1>went to Avenue d,</v>

324
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.590
<v Speaker 1>which is the fucking shitty street in Fort Pierce.</v>

325
00:07:21.591 --> 00:07:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're going to like every city,</v>

326
00:07:23.961 --> 00:07:24.794
<v Speaker 1>you know you have like,</v>

327
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:25.430
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

328
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.740
<v Speaker 1>whatever city you're in there like that's ever seen.</v>

329
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.580
<v Speaker 1>If you've been to the street where you see open drug dealing where there's not</v>

330
00:07:31.581 --> 00:07:33.500
<v Speaker 1>even some type of facade Angeles,</v>

331
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:33.771
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

332
00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:35.690
<v Speaker 1>but you've been down a street where there's like,</v>

333
00:07:35.691 --> 00:07:36.920
<v Speaker 1>there's no pretense about it.</v>

334
00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:38.570
<v Speaker 1>There's just like Los Angeles.</v>

335
00:07:38.571 --> 00:07:39.320
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>

336
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.150
<v Speaker 1>which part of the film and fear factor?</v>

337
00:07:41.151 --> 00:07:44.660
<v Speaker 1>We were actually filming the playboy playmate addition of fear factor downtown</v>

338
00:07:44.661 --> 00:07:45.180
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>

339
00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:45.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

340
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:46.970
<v Speaker 1>We were watching people sell drugs,</v>

341
00:07:46.971 --> 00:07:48.260
<v Speaker 1>smoked crack right there.</v>

342
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:49.850
<v Speaker 1>We were in a crane and we're like,</v>

343
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:50.421
<v Speaker 1>I go look,</v>

344
00:07:50.421 --> 00:07:51.260
<v Speaker 1>they're smoking crack.</v>

345
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:51.980
<v Speaker 1>And the girl's like,</v>

346
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:52.401
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

347
00:07:52.401 --> 00:07:54.620
<v Speaker 1>they are smoking crack and like this is ridiculous.</v>

348
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:56.080
<v Speaker 1>No one's protecting us.</v>

349
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:56.990
<v Speaker 1>We're up here on a crane.</v>

350
00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:02.020
<v Speaker 1>That was exactly like this where we pulled up in in Steve's car and the windows</v>

351
00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:04.160
<v Speaker 1>come down and we just get surrounded.</v>

352
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:09.860
<v Speaker 1>Like the car got surrounded by six guys and they reached in their jackets and</v>

353
00:08:09.861 --> 00:08:11.770
<v Speaker 1>they go at this one guy who was,</v>

354
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.270
<v Speaker 1>y'all look familiar and this other guy goes,</v>

355
00:08:14.271 --> 00:08:14.421
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

356
00:08:14.421 --> 00:08:15.470
<v Speaker 1>y'all are real familiar.</v>

357
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.940
<v Speaker 1>Y'All ever been here before?</v>

358
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:17.660
<v Speaker 1>And that when you,</v>

359
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:19.760
<v Speaker 1>when somebody says that you look familiar,</v>

360
00:08:19.761 --> 00:08:20.594
<v Speaker 1>have you been here before?</v>

361
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:21.763
<v Speaker 1>How would you answer that?</v>

362
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:23.060
<v Speaker 1>I just say,</v>

363
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:23.450
<v Speaker 1>nope.</v>

364
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:23.990
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

365
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.490
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

366
00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:25.940
