<v Speaker 1>Show our first podcast with you.</v>

26
00:00:41.051 --> 00:00:41.741
<v Speaker 1>You had Dick Pills,</v>

27
00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:45.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure and no band took one or you were talking about having a boner</v>

28
00:00:45.641 --> 00:00:46.800
<v Speaker 1>for like six hours though.</v>

29
00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:47.880
<v Speaker 1>Those totally unrelated.</v>

30
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.090
<v Speaker 1>He was getting some shit at gas stations to tell him that I got,</v>

31
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.560
<v Speaker 1>that was the beginning of a bad addiction.</v>

32
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.910
<v Speaker 1>I went deep.</v>

33
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:55.661
<v Speaker 1>We did what was,</v>

34
00:00:55.661 --> 00:00:56.820
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't as many guns.</v>

35
00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:57.940
<v Speaker 1>We ship involved for that.</v>

36
00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:58.241
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

37
00:00:58.241 --> 00:01:01.360
<v Speaker 1>it's just Mexican viagara where they take like Viagra and mixed with the acorns</v>

38
00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:03.340
<v Speaker 1>and call it a supplement and it's just isn't it?</v>

39
00:01:03.341 --> 00:01:03.931
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to.</v>

40
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:04.780
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what you're eating.</v>

41
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.680
<v Speaker 2>Oh word.</v>

42
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.980
<v Speaker 2>What it is is like if you would by Aubrey explained it to us,</v>

43
00:01:09.981 --> 00:01:10.700
<v Speaker 2>the hustle.</v>

44
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.470
<v Speaker 2>If you would buy like you know super rocket pills at the gas station and it says</v>

45
00:01:15.471 --> 00:01:17.360
<v Speaker 2>guaranteed erection and all this jazz,</v>

46
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.890
<v Speaker 2>they're just selling you Viagra,</v>

47
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.300
<v Speaker 2>but they're doing it without a prescription.</v>

48
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.440
<v Speaker 2>So they're just putting Viagra in these pills and then saying,</v>

49
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.771
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

50
00:01:24.771 --> 00:01:26.390
<v Speaker 2>this is our super secret supplement.</v>

51
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.710
<v Speaker 2>And when people find out at works,</v>

52
00:01:27.711 --> 00:01:28.940
<v Speaker 2>they buy the shit out of it.</v>

53
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.040
<v Speaker 2>It's a way to buy viagara without a prescription.</v>

54
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.811
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

55
00:01:32.811 --> 00:01:37.090
<v Speaker 2>But the fines are very low and regulating them.</v>

56
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.910
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

57
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:38.630
<v Speaker 2>Good question.</v>

58
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.811
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

59
00:01:38.811 --> 00:01:39.680
<v Speaker 2>the FDA regs,</v>

60
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.220
<v Speaker 2>they regulated if they find out that it's actually Viagara,</v>

61
00:01:43.221 --> 00:01:46.280
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of times they don't find out there's a million different names and</v>

62
00:01:46.281 --> 00:01:47.960
<v Speaker 2>apparently they get a small fine.</v>

63
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.860
<v Speaker 2>What RB said is some of the companies will change their name and then restart up</v>

64
00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:53.900
<v Speaker 2>under a different name and did this the same fucking shit.</v>

65
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Then what are we doing music?</v>

66
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:57.740
<v Speaker 1>What should be getting boners</v>

67
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean they just did change the name.</v>

68
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.420
<v Speaker 1>Do you just take it and then</v>

69
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.230
<v Speaker 1>some of them times it doesn't work.</v>

70
00:02:06.231 --> 00:02:07.700
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like mushrooms where it really,</v>

71
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.060
<v Speaker 1>it's based on what you eat I find instead is it is never good though.</v>

72
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.160
<v Speaker 1>That seems like integrating motion is doing like their knuckle over to blow up.</v>

73
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.223
<v Speaker 1>You guys don't do that.</v>

74
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.420
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work like that.</v>

75
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.610
<v Speaker 1>Mine does not know I'm getting sad.</v>

76
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh boy.</v>

77
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.500
<v Speaker 1>I wish I had those extra effects.</v>

78
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.190
<v Speaker 1>Go to the gas station convenience store.</v>

79
00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:29.024
<v Speaker 1>We'll come back.</v>

80
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.360
<v Speaker 1>Apparently some of them at the gas station or just bullshit.</v>

81
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

82
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.460
<v Speaker 1>You know some of them are just like some scoopy herbs but how great that will do</v>

83
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.080
<v Speaker 1>Jack Shit that like maybe you just works anyway.</v>

84
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.140
<v Speaker 1>It could if you really think you got the super hard on pills,</v>

85
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.120
<v Speaker 1>the Super Chinese viagara well you just went global with it and I was about to</v>

86
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.193
<v Speaker 1>ask the question.</v>

87
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.820
<v Speaker 1>Isn't there a uh,</v>

88
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.970
<v Speaker 1>a Chinese supplement where they're using Rhinoceros Horn ground?</v>

89
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.610
<v Speaker 1>That's been a big fucking issue.</v>

90
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.311
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

91
00:02:56.311 --> 00:03:00.520
<v Speaker 2>I was at the airport the other day and they had this big rhino photo that said I</v>

92
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:01.600
<v Speaker 2>am not medicine.</v>

93
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.490
<v Speaker 2>And it was talking about the use of a rhino horns and some eastern medicines.</v>

94
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:07.241
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

95
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 2>There's some people that really believe if they believe it can bring good luck,</v>

96
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.250
<v Speaker 2>it can cure things,</v>

97
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 2>it can cure cancer.</v>

98
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.800
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of amazing how you can set a trend,</v>

99
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.800
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

100
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.640
<v Speaker 3>Like obviously like that's a terrible,</v>

101
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.593
<v Speaker 3>terrible trend,</v>

102
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.800
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

103
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.480
<v Speaker 3>It takes one person to be like,</v>

104
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.400
<v Speaker 3>I ground up this rock.</v>

105
00:03:25.401 --> 00:03:26.420
<v Speaker 3>I found him in backyard.</v>

106
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:27.573
<v Speaker 3>It's</v>

107
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.360
<v Speaker 3>50 bucks.</v>

108
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.590
<v Speaker 3>The best ones,</v>

109
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.610
<v Speaker 3>just my childhood.</v>

110
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.130
<v Speaker 3>So Rhino seven,</v>

111
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.090
<v Speaker 3>it's the best one should</v>

112
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.960
<v Speaker 3>look at the explosion was running through fire.</v>

113
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.890
<v Speaker 3>How bad would your life soc if you saw a rhino running through fire,</v>

114
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.910
<v Speaker 3>like could you imagine if you like in a forest fire and you're trapped</v>

115
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:52.523
<v Speaker 3>and I'll write up</v>

116
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.343
<v Speaker 3>what</v>

117
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.430
<v Speaker 3>did you have cleats on the rhino is</v>

118
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.100
<v Speaker 2>is running through like this burst of fire.</v>

119
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.630
<v Speaker 2>That would be the worst thing.</v>

120
00:04:04.631 --> 00:04:06.970
<v Speaker 2>You keep one of the worst things on earth or you could ever say</v>

121
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.630
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of imagine your life.</v>

122
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.883
<v Speaker 3>Honestly,</v>

123
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.221
<v Speaker 3>we've talked,</v>

124
00:04:10.221 --> 00:04:13.190
<v Speaker 3>we've had bear talk earlier with Joe Bear Talk.</v>

125
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:15.801
<v Speaker 3>I got more questions,</v>

126
00:04:15.801 --> 00:04:16.160
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

127
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.940
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

128
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:17.680
<v Speaker 3>What kind of questions?</v>

129
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.513
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

130
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.353
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

131
00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.660
<v Speaker 3>so you were telling us that it's a a predator.</v>

132
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

133
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.670
<v Speaker 3>so it's in a different species of reaction and sense of it's perceiving</v>

134
00:04:28.671 --> 00:04:29.390
<v Speaker 3>everything around it.</v>

135
00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.590
<v Speaker 2>Bears are omnivores,</v>

136
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:31.031
<v Speaker 2>so they,</v>

137
00:04:31.031 --> 00:04:31.581
<v Speaker 2>they'll eat.</v>

138
00:04:31.581 --> 00:04:36.080
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they'll ignore any like any game because they find like a big patch of</v>

139
00:04:36.081 --> 00:04:39.080
<v Speaker 2>blueberries and Dell even ignore meat that's being left out.</v>

140
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.831
<v Speaker 2>They don't care.</v>

141
00:04:39.831 --> 00:04:42.260
<v Speaker 2>They'll find a patch of blueberries on a hill and they'll just,</v>

142
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.123
<v Speaker 2>they'll just go to that.</v>

143
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.380
<v Speaker 2>I dare of smells.</v>

144
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.140
<v Speaker 2>Incredible.</v>

145
00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.760
<v Speaker 3>So they are super sensitive though.</v>

146
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:47.250
<v Speaker 3>Like if you,</v>

147
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.871
<v Speaker 3>if you're over there,</v>

148
00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:48.800
<v Speaker 3>they know you're there.</v>

149
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.670
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

150
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.390
<v Speaker 2>They know you're there for sh like unless you are really far away,</v>

151
00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.230
<v Speaker 2>you could be like a hundred yards away or 200 yards away with the right wind.</v>

152
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.550
<v Speaker 2>They might not know you're there.</v>

153
00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.400
<v Speaker 2>But if they're near you and there's no wind,</v>

154
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.900
<v Speaker 2>most likely they know you're there.</v>

155
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.550
<v Speaker 2>If the wind is blowing towards them,</v>

156
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.720
<v Speaker 2>they definitely know you're there.</v>

157
00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:06.740
<v Speaker 2>They can just smell you.</v>

158
00:05:06.741 --> 00:05:10.640
<v Speaker 2>And their sense of smell is way better than a dog.</v>

159
00:05:10.641 --> 00:05:13.460
<v Speaker 2>And a dog's sense of smell is insanely better than a person's.</v>

160
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:14.120
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

161
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.953
<v Speaker 2>this is like the,</v>

162
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.860
<v Speaker 2>it's really hard for them to measure like what animals have the best sense of</v>

163
00:05:18.861 --> 00:05:19.191
<v Speaker 2>smell.</v>

164
00:05:19.191 --> 00:05:21.290
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to really kind of quantify it,</v>

165
00:05:21.291 --> 00:05:22.230
<v Speaker 2>but what,</v>

166
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.700
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

167
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.230
<v Speaker 2>what's even more difficult as us even imagining like how good a dog's sense of</v>

168
00:05:27.231 --> 00:05:28.064
<v Speaker 2>smell is.</v>

169
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.710
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's a totally different perception at that point.</v>

170
00:05:30.711 --> 00:05:31.390
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

171
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.890
<v Speaker 3>The smell like fear 48 totally.</v>

172
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

173
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:35.443
<v Speaker 3>And it's all,</v>

174
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.060
<v Speaker 3>it's like seeing an infrared or something like that.</v>

175
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.990
<v Speaker 3>The world just opens up into components.</v>

176
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.710
<v Speaker 3>Is there like a fear of pheromone that you emit,</v>

177
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:43.760
<v Speaker 3>I guess their mascot,</v>

178
00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:44.613
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

179
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.990
<v Speaker 3>It's weird</v>

180
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.300
<v Speaker 2>shit that you smell when you're around people that you don't like,</v>

181
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.413
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

182
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.980
<v Speaker 2>or that people that freak you out or people that might have bad intentions.</v>

183
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.300
<v Speaker 2>They have a weird smell,</v>

184
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.320
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

185
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.153
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

186
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:56.993
<v Speaker 2>I have a nose like a,</v>

187
00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:58.340
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

188
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.080
<v Speaker 4>It's really weird to track bad guys.</v>

189
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.093
<v Speaker 4>I really can.</v>

190
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.490
<v Speaker 4>I swear to God so far this room is okay.</v>

191
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:05.383
<v Speaker 4>Oh sure.</v>

192
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.460
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's doing great.</v>

193
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.230
<v Speaker 4>Did you give gay Jamie a good sniff?</v>

194
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:10.790
<v Speaker 4>I didn't hear you smell great.</v>

195
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:12.770
<v Speaker 4>You passed the test?</v>

196
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.601
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

197
00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:17.360
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't imagine like smelling everybody's farts.</v>

198
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:18.260
<v Speaker 4>Like in a city,</v>

199
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:19.730
<v Speaker 4>like if you're at a ball,</v>

200
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.380
<v Speaker 4>I'll give your a dog and you see a fart.</v>

201
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.460
<v Speaker 4>But if you're a dog you're eating shit.</v>

202
00:06:25.461 --> 00:06:26.590
<v Speaker 4>So your industry you don't want,</v>

203
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:27.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't mind at all.</v>

204
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.150
<v Speaker 4>They don't have any cultural context,</v>

205
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.843
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

206
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.790
<v Speaker 4>yet.</v>

207
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:32.623
<v Speaker 4>I think</v>

208
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.050
<v Speaker 5>faith they will evolve and we will see it.</v>

209
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.250
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean like look a jumpy,</v>

210
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:38.701
<v Speaker 4>jumpy,</v>

211
00:06:38.701 --> 00:06:39.151
<v Speaker 4>the dog.</v>

212
00:06:39.151 --> 00:06:40.710
<v Speaker 4>I mean he is way ahead of schedule.</v>

213
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.150
<v Speaker 4>Do you think dogs have today?</v>

214
00:06:42.151 --> 00:06:43.190
<v Speaker 4>Look back at the dogs.</v>

215
00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:44.810
<v Speaker 4>I was like five from years ago and goes what?</v>

216
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.110
<v Speaker 4>A bunch of fucking idiots</v>

217
00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.770
<v Speaker 4>freaking out when they heard the first siren.</v>

218
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:51.810
<v Speaker 4>Like they had their heroes.</v>

219
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:53.220
<v Speaker 4>You don't even know about.</v>

220
00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:54.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

221
00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:54.830
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

222
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:55.950
<v Speaker 4>do you remember that one dog?</v>

223
00:06:55.951 --> 00:06:56.970
<v Speaker 4>The dog to save the guy,</v>

224
00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.950
<v Speaker 4>the first one to bear the bone?</v>

225
00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

226
00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.740
<v Speaker 4>My friend Steve or was telling me that they used to do show</v>

227
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:06.500
<v Speaker 2>knows where they would take like a raft filled with animals and they would push</v>

228
00:07:06.501 --> 00:07:08.380
<v Speaker 2>them off of the um,</v>

229
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:09.741
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

230
00:07:09.741 --> 00:07:09.911
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

231
00:07:09.911 --> 00:07:12.530
<v Speaker 2>the big waterfall a w what does it mean Jaeger?</v>

232
00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:13.340
<v Speaker 2>No false.</v>

233
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:13.851
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

234
00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:14.481
<v Speaker 2>They would tear,</v>

235
00:07:14.481 --> 00:07:15.710
<v Speaker 2>people would pay to watch it.</v>

236
00:07:15.711 --> 00:07:20.300
<v Speaker 2>It was still on the sidelines and they would push a raft of animals off Niagara</v>

237
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.133
<v Speaker 2>Falls to their death.</v>

238
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.010
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

239
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

240
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.290
<v Speaker 2>It's like some early 1900 shit.</v>

241
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:25.640
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

242
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.211
<v Speaker 2>Because people,</v>

243
00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:26.481
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

244
00:07:26.481 --> 00:07:28.400
<v Speaker 2>it was a show like people get see the show.</v>

245
00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:29.690
<v Speaker 2>I think they would pay to see,</v>

246
00:07:29.691 --> 00:07:33.950
<v Speaker 2>so they would load this raft up with exotic animals that were freaking out and</v>

247
00:07:33.951 --> 00:07:38.300
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out how to get off the raft and then send them over the top six</v>

248
00:07:38.301 --> 00:07:38.930
<v Speaker 2>sons of bitches.</v>

249
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:39.470
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

250
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:40.610
<v Speaker 2>How weird.</v>

251
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

252
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.920
<v Speaker 4>Now does it sound an even entertaining,</v>

253
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.360
<v Speaker 4>depressed now?</v>

254
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:45.470
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

255
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:46.300
<v Speaker 4>It's definitely not right.</v>

256
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:46.720
<v Speaker 2>Retaining,</v>

257
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.920
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely disgusting.</v>

258
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:49.150
<v Speaker 2>Definitely should be illegal.</v>

259
00:07:49.151 --> 00:07:50.080
<v Speaker 2>Definitely should be punished.</v>

260
00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:55.260
<v Speaker 2>But if you were there while that raft is headed towards the apex,</v>

261
00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:57.520
<v Speaker 2>do you keep looking or do you go,</v>

262
00:07:57.521 --> 00:07:57.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to</v>

263
00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:58.380
<v Speaker 4>part of this,</v>

264
00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:59.670
<v Speaker 4>that was like this too late</v>

265
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:05.650
<v Speaker 5>form of all the fucking Facebook shit of like distracted by it was like,</v>

266
00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:09.580
<v Speaker 5>let's just watch something absolutely asinine or horrifying.</v>

267
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.030
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

268
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:11.260
<v Speaker 5>Because it's,</v>

269
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:12.580
<v Speaker 5>there's that shock factor,</v>

270
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.030
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

271
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:13.301
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

272
00:08:13.301 --> 00:08:17.530
<v Speaker 5>but I feel like that's not too far off from watching dog fighting even though</v>

273
00:08:17.531 --> 00:08:19.360
<v Speaker 5>there's gambling and betting involved,</v>

274
00:08:19.361 --> 00:08:22.390
<v Speaker 5>but like people that can handle that kind of thing.</v>

275
00:08:22.391 --> 00:08:23.440
<v Speaker 5>I think there's just like,</v>

276
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:25.300
<v Speaker 5>I think there's some sort of,</v>

277
00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:26.950
<v Speaker 5>I can't relate to this,</v>

278
00:08:26.951 --> 00:08:28.810
<v Speaker 5>but I think that there's some sort of like innate,</v>

279
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.033
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

280
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:35.050
<v Speaker 5>a primal instinct to want to see something terrible.</v>

281
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.190
<v Speaker 5>So it's like more terrible than what you can experience in your everyday life.</v>

282
00:08:39.191 --> 00:08:40.810
<v Speaker 5>Maybe feel better about it or something.</v>

283
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.450
<v Speaker 5>Or your people are just sick and disgusting,</v>

284
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:44.550
<v Speaker 2>I think either warm.</v>

285
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:44.781
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

286
00:08:44.781 --> 00:08:45.980
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to be one of the other,</v>

287
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:46.551
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

288
00:08:46.551 --> 00:08:47.450
<v Speaker 2>it could have been,</v>

289
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.330
<v Speaker 2>could be both or you should,</v>

290
00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.061
<v Speaker 2>but that's for real.</v>

291
00:08:50.061 --> 00:08:51.410
<v Speaker 2>Like people actually really do that.</v>

292
00:08:51.411 --> 00:08:51.590
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

293
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:52.211
<v Speaker 2>that's not a joke.</v>

294
00:08:52.211 --> 00:08:52.400
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

295
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.070
<v Speaker 2>it was real.</v>

296
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:54.140
<v Speaker 2>It was all like a show.</v>

297
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:55.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

298
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 2>People would pay to see it.</v>

299
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:56.993
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

300
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.130
<v Speaker 5>We were just talking about this earlier actually.</v>

301
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:00.781
<v Speaker 5>What are you pulling in?</v>

302
00:09:00.781 --> 00:09:01.860
<v Speaker 5>We're just trying to find pictures of it.</v>

303
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:02.753
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

304
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:05.370
<v Speaker 5>we were just talking about this earlier about,</v>

305
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:06.263
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

306
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.201
<v Speaker 5>being sensitive.</v>

307
00:09:07.201 --> 00:09:09.330
<v Speaker 5>And I was telling Joe that,</v>

308
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.193
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

309
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.001
<v Speaker 5>there's some,</v>

310
00:09:11.001 --> 00:09:11.230
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

311
00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:11.561
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>

312
00:09:11.561 --> 00:09:13.030
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about being sensitive that</v>

313
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.941
<v Speaker 4>I brought the,</v>

314
00:09:15.941 --> 00:09:17.880
<v Speaker 4>I run the Feminine Energy Today.</v>

315
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:18.700
<v Speaker 4>God dammit.</v>

316
00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:19.533
<v Speaker 4>She does.</v>

317
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:23.860
<v Speaker 4>And the way energy and the killer of the feminine energy.</v>

318
00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:25.750
<v Speaker 5>It's true.</v>

319
00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:26.500
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

320
00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:27.070
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

321
00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:27.461
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

322
00:09:27.461 --> 00:09:31.180
<v Speaker 5>we were talking about TV and there's certain,</v>

323
00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:32.950
<v Speaker 5>whenever I'm witnessing,</v>

324
00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.830
<v Speaker 5>whether it's in a TV show or movie or real life,</v>

325
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:41.550
<v Speaker 5>some people really losing or people just being absolutely terrible to one</v>

326
00:09:42.341 --> 00:09:42.701
<v Speaker 5>another,</v>

327
00:09:42.701 --> 00:09:45.970
<v Speaker 5>especially when someone is trying their best and they just kicked,</v>

328
00:09:45.971 --> 00:09:46.960
<v Speaker 5>kicked when they're down.</v>

329
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:47.770
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

330
00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:49.090
<v Speaker 5>Guts me that I just,</v>

331
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:49.800
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

332
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.750
<v Speaker 5>can cause you're a genuinely nice person.</v>

333
00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:52.593
<v Speaker 5>She was my soul.</v>

334
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:55.050
<v Speaker 6>You're a genuinely nice person who would never do that.</v>

335
00:09:55.051 --> 00:09:56.610
<v Speaker 6>So you see it and it drives you crazy.</v>

336
00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:00.870
<v Speaker 6>One of the things that drives us crazy is the horrible things that we hope we</v>

337
00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:01.800
<v Speaker 6>never seen ourselves.</v>

338
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:02.590
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

339
00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:04.170
<v Speaker 6>like when we see something really pathetic,</v>

340
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:04.980
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

341
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.530
<v Speaker 6>there's horrible or mean or vicious.</v>

342
00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:11.880
<v Speaker 6>There's part of us that like knows it's evil and knows it's bad and people are</v>

343
00:10:11.881 --> 00:10:16.330
<v Speaker 6>being hurt and there that that part of us without a doubt is angry or upset at</v>

344
00:10:16.331 --> 00:10:17.550
<v Speaker 6>the situation.</v>

345
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:20.370
<v Speaker 6>But there's also a part of us that hopes that were never like that.</v>

346
00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:20.850
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

347
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:21.350
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

348
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.451
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

349
00:10:21.451 --> 00:10:23.040
<v Speaker 6>I think that's part of like what you see.</v>

350
00:10:23.041 --> 00:10:26.750
<v Speaker 6>Even when you see like a murderer or we see like someone whose life has gotten</v>

351
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.000
<v Speaker 6>totally out of control and off the rails and into the woods,</v>

352
00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:31.680
<v Speaker 6>you just go,</v>

353
00:10:31.681 --> 00:10:32.011
<v Speaker 6>God,</v>

354
00:10:32.011 --> 00:10:32.880
<v Speaker 6>could that have been me?</v>

355
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:33.331
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

356
00:10:33.331 --> 00:10:35.220
<v Speaker 6>like that's one of the things that freaks you out the most.</v>

357
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:35.581
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

358
00:10:35.581 --> 00:10:38.610
<v Speaker 4>it opens up the spectrum of what we're capable of.</v>

359
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:42.870
<v Speaker 4>You see some person who shows up at their job and just started shooting people</v>

360
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.621
<v Speaker 4>and you go,</v>

361
00:10:43.621 --> 00:10:45.270
<v Speaker 4>what brought her to do that?</v>

362
00:10:45.271 --> 00:10:45.630
<v Speaker 4>What brought,</v>

363
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:46.530
<v Speaker 4>it's usually not a her,</v>

364
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:47.580
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why I said hurts.</v>

365
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:49.890
<v Speaker 4>Is it ever been her woman?</v>

366
00:10:49.891 --> 00:10:50.670
<v Speaker 4>Mass shooter?</v>

367
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:51.900
<v Speaker 4>That's a really good fucking question.</v>

368
00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:54.120
<v Speaker 4>There was just maybe one or two.</v>

369
00:10:54.121 --> 00:10:54.591
<v Speaker 4>I was just read.</v>

370
00:10:54.591 --> 00:10:55.570
<v Speaker 4>There was this Escobar.</v>

371
00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:00.580
<v Speaker 4>It's a very good question about how she's trying to be like even it's not even</v>

372
00:11:00.751 --> 00:11:01.110
<v Speaker 4>at all.</v>

373
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

374
00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:03.570
<v Speaker 4>There's an Esquire articles that get any ideas out there.</v>

375
00:11:03.571 --> 00:11:04.020
<v Speaker 4>Ladies.</v>

376
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.580
<v Speaker 4>Let's just keep it cool.</v>

377
00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:06.210
<v Speaker 4>Keep it,</v>

378
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:07.950
<v Speaker 4>cause everybody stay calm.</v>

379
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:09.060
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

380
00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.670
<v Speaker 4>and it was really interesting because half of the article was just like,</v>

381
00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:11.840
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

382
00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.630
<v Speaker 4>a history of maybe just the last 10 years of mass shooting.</v>

383
00:11:15.631 --> 00:11:19.770
<v Speaker 4>There's been a ridiculous amount of mass shootings are always mail.</v>

384
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:20.850
<v Speaker 4>It's in Time magazine,</v>

385
00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:24.900
<v Speaker 4>except there's a big fucking stupid pulldown menu that we can't get out of the</v>

386
00:11:24.901 --> 00:11:25.530
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

387
00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:26.071
<v Speaker 4>Where to go.</v>

388
00:11:26.071 --> 00:11:27.450
<v Speaker 4>How about you use Squarespace?</v>

389
00:11:27.451 --> 00:11:27.930
<v Speaker 4>You fucks.</v>

390
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:28.763
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

391
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.430
<v Speaker 4>Make yourself a really real cause that has happened or are we just going to</v>

392
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:35.960
<v Speaker 4>add from earlier</v>

393
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:38.363
<v Speaker 4>Rhino Horn?</v>

394
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:39.203
<v Speaker 4>We didn't eat.</v>

395
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:39.610
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

396
00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:41.220
<v Speaker 4>Squarespace isn't even on today's ads.</v>

397
00:11:41.221 --> 00:11:42.930
<v Speaker 4>So stop talking.</v>

398
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:43.883
<v Speaker 4>Just stop.</v>

399
00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:44.641
<v Speaker 4>On the other hand,</v>

400
00:11:44.641 --> 00:11:45.780
<v Speaker 4>make an excellent website.</v>

401
00:11:45.781 --> 00:11:46.890
<v Speaker 4>So I'm saying the other half have,</v>

402
00:11:46.891 --> 00:11:50.250
<v Speaker 4>the Esquire article was about this dude who was foiled in his,</v>

403
00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:51.120
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

404
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.320
<v Speaker 4>mass shooting attempt.</v>

405
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.350
<v Speaker 4>And he went to,</v>

406
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:54.040
<v Speaker 4>but they didn't,</v>

407
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.720
<v Speaker 3>it was like a frank abignail,</v>

408
00:11:56.050 --> 00:12:01.050
<v Speaker 3>you know how he was this world traveling a counterfeiter and eventually they</v>

409
00:12:01.301 --> 00:12:03.500
<v Speaker 3>caught him and he started working for the FBI.</v>

410
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:04.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm not aware of that.</v>

411
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:04.740
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

412
00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:05.140
<v Speaker 3>Is that,</v>

413
00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:06.780
<v Speaker 3>catch me if you can movie oh,</v>

414
00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:07.633
<v Speaker 3>DiCaprio.</v>

415
00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.740
<v Speaker 3>That's about that guy.</v>

416
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:09.491
<v Speaker 3>That's about that dude.</v>

417
00:12:09.491 --> 00:12:12.400
<v Speaker 3>And this was a similar situation where they found this mass shooter who didn't</v>

418
00:12:12.401 --> 00:12:15.910
<v Speaker 3>actually get to carry out his plan and it started to use him to get into the</v>

419
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:17.320
<v Speaker 3>psyche of these dudes.</v>

420
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.513
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

421
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.220
<v Speaker 3>And he talks about the process,</v>

422
00:12:21.221 --> 00:12:21.590
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

423
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.761
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

424
00:12:21.761 --> 00:12:23.050
<v Speaker 3>it starts with isolation,</v>

425
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:26.530
<v Speaker 3>but the turning point was him starting to feel like he was,</v>

426
00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:27.191
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

427
00:12:27.191 --> 00:12:28.780
<v Speaker 3>he realized he was better than everybody.</v>

428
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.360
<v Speaker 3>It was loneliness and alienation and then like,</v>

429
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:31.931
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

430
00:12:31.931 --> 00:12:34.750
<v Speaker 3>but the reason is I'm the best and they're the worst,</v>

431
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:35.561
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

432
00:12:35.561 --> 00:12:36.520
<v Speaker 3>And He created his plant.</v>

433
00:12:36.521 --> 00:12:38.020
<v Speaker 3>So all these guys</v>

434
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:39.611
<v Speaker 4>tell us,</v>

435
00:12:39.611 --> 00:12:44.611
<v Speaker 4>your serial killer is this your soul every three hours for a mass shooter.</v>

436
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:46.050

591
00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.860
<v Speaker 6>I'm just telling jokes.</v>

592
00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:32.751
<v Speaker 6>I just did my,</v>

593
00:16:32.751 --> 00:16:35.540
<v Speaker 6>a comedy central special in Denver in November.</v>

594
00:16:35.541 --> 00:16:38.450
<v Speaker 6>So what I'm doing right now is I'm writing new jokes,</v>

595
00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:39.580
<v Speaker 6>shit,</v>

596
00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:40.550
<v Speaker 6>load of new jokes.</v>

597
00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:42.363
<v Speaker 6>How do you,</v>

598
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:43.243
<v Speaker 6>how do you approach that?</v>

599
00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:44.451
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

600
00:16:44.451 --> 00:16:45.170
<v Speaker 6>you right.</v>

601
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:48.260
<v Speaker 6>And then you take those ideas and you fuck with him onstage.</v>

602
00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:49.680
<v Speaker 6>You really don't know what,</v>

603
00:16:49.681 --> 00:16:50.900
<v Speaker 6>like last night I did a punch,</v>

604
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:51.561
<v Speaker 6>a new shit.</v>

605
00:16:51.561 --> 00:16:52.730
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know where it was going,</v>

606
00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:53.421
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

607
00:16:53.421 --> 00:16:53.690
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

608
00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:56.930
<v Speaker 6>but I kind of had ideas where it would probably go and then there was some,</v>

609
00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:58.520
<v Speaker 6>there's some things you,</v>

610
00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.150
<v Speaker 6>you change when you're on the fly because you kind of realize like on the fly</v>

611
00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.870
<v Speaker 6>that it'd be better if I said it like this or it'd be make more sense if I said</v>

612
00:17:05.871 --> 00:17:06.320
<v Speaker 6>it like that.</v>

613
00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:10.160
<v Speaker 6>Or I could also say this and you know you can under the pressure of like trying</v>

614
00:17:10.161 --> 00:17:11.960
<v Speaker 6>to forge the idea on stage,</v>

615
00:17:11.961 --> 00:17:13.550
<v Speaker 6>he come up with some fun lines,</v>

616
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:15.800
<v Speaker 6>bounce it off of anybody.</v>

617
00:17:15.801 --> 00:17:16.020
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

618
00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:16.500
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

619
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.450
<v Speaker 6>you just go for it.</v>

620
00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.430
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to do that.</v>

621
00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:20.780
<v Speaker 6>What do you iPhone it?</v>

622
00:17:20.781 --> 00:17:22.640
<v Speaker 6>You're just sitting in your car and you come up with shit.</v>

623
00:17:22.641 --> 00:17:23.110
<v Speaker 6>Both.</v>

624
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:24.320
<v Speaker 6>I fall in it and I also,</v>

625
00:17:24.321 --> 00:17:27.080
<v Speaker 6>a lot of times I found it into a print form.</v>

626
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:28.220
<v Speaker 6>I used to,</v>

627
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.710
<v Speaker 6>I used that thing that's note pad,</v>

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:32.080
<v Speaker 6>you know the nurse had you used the,</v>

629
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.710

630
00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:34.521
<v Speaker 6>talk into it.</v>

631
00:17:34.521 --> 00:17:35.420
<v Speaker 6>It's unbelievable.</v>

632
00:17:35.421 --> 00:17:36.254
<v Speaker 6>If you ever tried it,</v>

633
00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.690
<v Speaker 6>but did you have a droid the last time I saw?</v>

634
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:39.021
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

635
00:17:39.021 --> 00:17:39.710
<v Speaker 6>I got rid of it.</v>

636
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:40.940
<v Speaker 6>So he's switched that shit up.</v>

637
00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:41.241
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

638
00:17:41.241 --> 00:17:42.061
<v Speaker 6>but then I got a new one.</v>

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:47.883

652
00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't get really know how to check this out.</v>

653
00:18:01.111 --> 00:18:03.750
<v Speaker 2>Watch why put it talking to this honey.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Honey ban is fucking bad ass sweet guy.</v>

655
00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:08.213
<v Speaker 2>Watch this.</v>

656
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.760
<v Speaker 2>I love this positive reinforcement on the honey band is fucking dude.</v>

657
00:18:11.761 --> 00:18:12.860
<v Speaker 2>She listens that amazing.</v>

658
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:13.130
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

659
00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:14.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean it just doesn't work like that.</v>

660
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.170
<v Speaker 2>It worked exactly.</v>

661
00:18:16.171 --> 00:18:20.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's got all the words and you just talk into it and it prints it up.</v>

662
00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:22.930
<v Speaker 2>And so I like doing that when I'm driving cause of,</v>

663
00:18:22.931 --> 00:18:27.210
<v Speaker 2>I have an idea and like I could record it and maybe that's the way to go.</v>

664
00:18:27.211 --> 00:18:28.044
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes</v>

665
00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:31.470
<v Speaker 2>make us a sculpture.</v>

666
00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:32.580
<v Speaker 2>It should be a sculpture.</v>

667
00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:37.640
<v Speaker 2>I know what's going to be a dude with his pants off and the fucking Texas belt</v>

668
00:18:37.831 --> 00:18:38.350
<v Speaker 2>buckle.</v>

669
00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:41.530
<v Speaker 3>Did you know that the new Siri now does Shizam so you could just,</v>

670
00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:42.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

671
00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.810
<v Speaker 3>do the that,</v>

672
00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:43.840
<v Speaker 3>what song is this?</v>

673
00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:44.703
<v Speaker 3>She never said,</v>

674
00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:48.000
<v Speaker 3>oh Sierra</v>

675
00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.450
<v Speaker 3>does that even come up with it?</v>

676
00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:53.440
<v Speaker 3>He puts it in the front.</v>

677
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.410
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of loans in your pocket or a lot of room in the front.</v>

678
00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:57.573
<v Speaker 3>My group,</v>

679
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:58.750
<v Speaker 3>no extra room.</v>

680
00:18:58.790 --> 00:18:59.623
<v Speaker 3>Never</v>

681
00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:02.470
<v Speaker 3>once he get off that rule.</v>

682
00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.880
<v Speaker 3>There's some shrinkage I had,</v>

683
00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:07.301
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know.</v>

684
00:19:07.301 --> 00:19:08.530
<v Speaker 3>Sorry for being demanding.</v>

685
00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:09.980
<v Speaker 3>This is your fucking place</v>

686
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:14.400
<v Speaker 3>demanding.</v>

687
00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:14.660
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

688
00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:15.060
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

689
00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:15.460
<v Speaker 3>well see,</v>

690
00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:16.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if this truly applies,</v>

691
00:19:16.931 --> 00:19:18.550
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like a lot of people who write stuff,</v>

692
00:19:18.551 --> 00:19:19.090
<v Speaker 3>song,</v>

693
00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:19.451
<v Speaker 3>comedy,</v>

694
00:19:19.451 --> 00:19:20.100
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

695
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.450
<v Speaker 3>when you're young it comes or maybe not young,</v>

696
00:19:22.451 --> 00:19:23.860
<v Speaker 3>there's a certain pain point,</v>

697
00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:24.181
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

698
00:19:24.181 --> 00:19:26.860
<v Speaker 3>an initial point where it comes very unconsciously,</v>

699
00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:28.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

700
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.770
<v Speaker 3>just kind of flows out in a sense of like,</v>

701
00:19:29.771 --> 00:19:29.981
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

702
00:19:29.981 --> 00:19:31.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm just expressing myself.</v>

703
00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.930
<v Speaker 3>And then later on down the road there's this conscious element that you have to</v>

704
00:19:34.931 --> 00:19:39.100
<v Speaker 3>like retrain yourself to do something consciously that you may be used to do</v>

705
00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:39.851
<v Speaker 3>subconsciously.</v>

706
00:19:39.851 --> 00:19:40.930
<v Speaker 3>Am I presuming too much?</v>

707
00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:41.501
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

708
00:19:41.501 --> 00:19:42.200
<v Speaker 3>I think</v>

709
00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.090
<v Speaker 2>but he might be the exact opposite.</v>

710
00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:44.690
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

711
00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:48.800
<v Speaker 2>Because in comedy in the beginning you suck so hard that you're terrified of</v>

712
00:19:48.801 --> 00:19:50.720
<v Speaker 2>every stupid fucking word you're writing down.</v>

713
00:19:50.721 --> 00:19:52.880
<v Speaker 2>You have very little confidence in anything that you're thinking,</v>

714
00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:57.110
<v Speaker 2>but then as you get older you kind of understand what you think is funny about</v>

715
00:19:57.111 --> 00:19:58.130
<v Speaker 2>something and you,</v>

716
00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:00.470
<v Speaker 2>it also becomes like a different,</v>

717
00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.470
<v Speaker 2>that's more of a conscious act though,</v>

718
00:20:03.471 --> 00:20:04.304
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

719
00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:06.540
<v Speaker 2>Not necessarily that it's more of a conscious act.</v>

720
00:20:06.541 --> 00:20:07.220
<v Speaker 2>It's just put the you,</v>

721
00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:09.640
<v Speaker 2>you understand what you're trying to do now because when,</v>

722
00:20:09.641 --> 00:20:10.670
<v Speaker 2>when you're young,</v>

723
00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:13.670
<v Speaker 2>what you're trying to do is you're trying to kick ass,</v>

724
00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.610
<v Speaker 2>like I'm going to get this joke and then it's going to be so awesome.</v>

725
00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:18.290
<v Speaker 2>It's like I was trying to explain to a friend,</v>

726
00:20:18.291 --> 00:20:20.690
<v Speaker 2>like if you made an album,</v>

727
00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.040
<v Speaker 2>like if you guys decided to make an album,</v>

728
00:20:22.041 --> 00:20:22.401
<v Speaker 2>like honey,</v>

729
00:20:22.401 --> 00:20:25.610
<v Speaker 2>honey is going to make an album and our goal is to sell the most fucking records</v>

730
00:20:25.611 --> 00:20:26.444
<v Speaker 2>of all time.</v>

731
00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.860
<v Speaker 2>So that's what we're going to do with this album.</v>

732
00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:30.950
<v Speaker 2>We're going to make the fucking album that sells more fucking records.</v>

733
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:33.470
<v Speaker 2>We're going to make $1 million or billion,</v>

734
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:36.530
<v Speaker 2>million dollars because I want to fucking yacht and I want a jet in a Bentley.</v>

735
00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:42.080
<v Speaker 2>So if you approached writing your songs and that's all you were thinking about,</v>

736
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:44.390
<v Speaker 2>it would fuck you up hard.</v>

737
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:47.410
<v Speaker 2>Like you would somehow or another lose your shin.</v>

738
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 2>That have to</v>

739
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.840
<v Speaker 5>happen to me when I was an actor.</v>

740
00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:50.713
<v Speaker 5>What did you want?</v>

741
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.980
<v Speaker 5>Fucking money I want to do to survive.</v>

742
00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:58.030
<v Speaker 5>And I worked for a little while and I had like a good two years.</v>

743
00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:59.530
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

744
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:03.310
<v Speaker 5>it was like once I moved to La from,</v>

745
00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:06.640
<v Speaker 5>I was living in New York and I moved to La and I stopped working.</v>

746
00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.940
<v Speaker 5>And then every time I went to an audition,</v>

747
00:21:09.941 --> 00:21:11.050
<v Speaker 5>I was just so desperate.</v>

748
00:21:11.051 --> 00:21:13.000
<v Speaker 5>Like I couldn't focus on what was right in front of me.</v>

749
00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:14.170
<v Speaker 5>I had to focus on what was,</v>

750
00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.620
<v Speaker 5>what would happen if I got the job instead of I think people can smell that.</v>

751
00:21:17.621 --> 00:21:18.310
<v Speaker 5>I'm not kidding.</v>

752
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:19.000
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

753
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:19.640
<v Speaker 5>It's totally,</v>

754
00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:20.350
<v Speaker 5>definitely.</v>

755
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:21.190
<v Speaker 5>But also,</v>

756
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:22.240
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

757
00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:22.601
<v Speaker 5>on a,</v>

758
00:21:22.601 --> 00:21:23.530
<v Speaker 5>as a side note,</v>

759
00:21:23.531 --> 00:21:26.620
<v Speaker 5>like that's why how I started playing music cause I sort of got,</v>

760
00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:27.251
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

761
00:21:27.251 --> 00:21:28.300
<v Speaker 5>thrown off course.</v>

762
00:21:28.301 --> 00:21:29.740
<v Speaker 5>I was totally lost and I,</v>

763
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:30.581
<v Speaker 5>I moved to La,</v>

764
00:21:30.581 --> 00:21:32.590
<v Speaker 5>I didn't have any friends when I got here.</v>

765
00:21:32.591 --> 00:21:35.020
<v Speaker 5>I had like a boyfriend and we broke up and yeah,</v>

766
00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:35.873
<v Speaker 5>Super Sad.</v>

767
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:38.470
<v Speaker 5>And then I wrote these terrible sad songs.</v>

768
00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:41.393
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>

769
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.991
<v Speaker 5>but it's true.</v>

770
00:21:43.991 --> 00:21:45.790
<v Speaker 5>Like you know that that end result,</v>

771
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:46.720
<v Speaker 5>it's totally,</v>

772
00:21:46.721 --> 00:21:47.560
<v Speaker 5>you're absolutely right.</v>

773
00:21:47.561 --> 00:21:48.610
<v Speaker 5>As far as like,</v>

774
00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:48.971
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

775
00:21:48.971 --> 00:21:49.960
<v Speaker 5>creativity goes,</v>

776
00:21:49.961 --> 00:21:50.181
<v Speaker 5>it's kind,</v>

777
00:21:50.181 --> 00:21:51.580
<v Speaker 5>Kinda like not up to you too.</v>

778
00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:52.520
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

779
00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:53.390
<v Speaker 6>I think I like,</v>

780
00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:56.960
<v Speaker 6>I really love being friends with guys like you guys because I don't know</v>

781
00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:58.340
<v Speaker 6>anything about music.</v>

782
00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:02.030
<v Speaker 6>So I get to appreciate it from this like really innocent point of view.</v>

783
00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:02.450
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

784
00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:02.631
<v Speaker 6>Ooh,</v>

785
00:22:02.631 --> 00:22:03.770
<v Speaker 6>that sounds awesome.</v>

786
00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:05.780
<v Speaker 6>Like I don't know anything about chords.</v>

787
00:22:05.781 --> 00:22:07.280
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how you do shit with your voice.</v>

788
00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:08.720
<v Speaker 6>I don't know anything about chords either.</v>

789
00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:12.890
<v Speaker 6>And that's kind of what I'm talking about it no in a sense of like,</v>

790
00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.890
<v Speaker 6>so we get to this point and this happens to a lot of people who go to</v>

791
00:22:15.891 --> 00:22:18.860
<v Speaker 6>conservatories are like really study the shit does it?</v>

792
00:22:18.861 --> 00:22:21.530
<v Speaker 6>They have this technical understanding all of a sudden and now they have to</v>

793
00:22:21.531 --> 00:22:25.070
<v Speaker 6>spend the rest of their career figuring out how to forget about that stuff and</v>

794
00:22:25.071 --> 00:22:26.960
<v Speaker 6>just like how do I come at this?</v>

795
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:31.010
<v Speaker 6>Like you're talking about like someone who doesn't really understand it coming</v>

796
00:22:31.011 --> 00:22:33.740
<v Speaker 6>from an emotional place and you're actually using it for what it's supposed to</v>

797
00:22:33.741 --> 00:22:34.574
<v Speaker 6>be used for.</v>

798
00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:34.761
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

799
00:22:34.761 --> 00:22:38.390
<v Speaker 6>I think maybe it's just like exercising too much focus on one area.</v>

800
00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:39.530
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

801
00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:44.210
<v Speaker 6>I think it's probably that like tactical proficiency is probably very important</v>

802
00:22:44.211 --> 00:22:45.044
<v Speaker 6>in music,</v>

803
00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:50.030
<v Speaker 6>but it's also like nurturing a creative viewpoint where if you're,</v>

804
00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:50.990
<v Speaker 6>if you're doing something,</v>

805
00:22:50.991 --> 00:22:51.824
<v Speaker 6>let's put it this way,</v>

806
00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:53.600
<v Speaker 6>if you're doing something and you're studying,</v>

807
00:22:53.601 --> 00:22:56.030
<v Speaker 6>this is not to knock studying music and practicing,</v>

808
00:22:56.031 --> 00:22:56.960
<v Speaker 6>but if you're practicing,</v>

809
00:22:56.961 --> 00:23:00.860
<v Speaker 6>say a very particular song and you're doing that song over and over and over</v>

810
00:23:00.861 --> 00:23:01.071
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>

811
00:23:01.071 --> 00:23:03.680
<v Speaker 6>like I'm sure you're gaining technical proficiency,</v>

812
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:08.630
<v Speaker 6>but should there be like an equal amount of time where you just explore making</v>

813
00:23:08.631 --> 00:23:09.650
<v Speaker 6>your own sounds,</v>

814
00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:10.551
<v Speaker 6>making your own,</v>

815
00:23:10.551 --> 00:23:13.340
<v Speaker 6>using your own lyrics to having your own thoughts?</v>

816
00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:17.060
<v Speaker 6>Or should you do like the classical music version of music,</v>

817
00:23:17.061 --> 00:23:19.220
<v Speaker 6>which is consistently performing Bach,</v>

818
00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:19.701
<v Speaker 6>Bach,</v>

819
00:23:19.701 --> 00:23:20.534
<v Speaker 6>Beethoven,</v>

820
00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:23.690
<v Speaker 6>like songs that have been done there in the can it,</v>

821
00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:25.430
<v Speaker 6>you're just recreating them.</v>

822
00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:27.080
<v Speaker 6>I think it's a little bit of everything.</v>

823
00:23:27.081 --> 00:23:27.920
<v Speaker 6>Did you want to say something?</v>

824
00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.210
<v Speaker 6>It is kind of a little bit of everything,</v>

825
00:23:29.211 --> 00:23:29.550
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

826
00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:30.231
<v Speaker 6>You beat me to,</v>

827
00:23:30.231 --> 00:23:31.000
<v Speaker 6>you got it.</v>

828
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:31.590
<v Speaker 5>The flow.</v>

829
00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:32.340
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

830
00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:32.611
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

831
00:23:32.611 --> 00:23:32.851
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

832
00:23:32.851 --> 00:23:33.181
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

833
00:23:33.181 --> 00:23:33.451
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

834
00:23:33.451 --> 00:23:34.890
<v Speaker 5>it is a little bit of everything because,</v>

835
00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:35.551
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

836
00:23:35.551 --> 00:23:38.580
<v Speaker 5>obviously like there's muscle memory when you're playing,</v>

837
00:23:38.581 --> 00:23:39.780
<v Speaker 5>so if you're in shape,</v>

838
00:23:39.781 --> 00:23:40.890
<v Speaker 5>it's just like working out,</v>

839
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:41.650
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

840
00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:41.920
<v Speaker 5>I'll,</v>

841
00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.480
<v Speaker 5>I'll do exercises of classical music just to like what he do.</v>

842
00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 5>I have</v>

843

879
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:57.850
<v Speaker 1>You could see my addiction whether you want to or not.</v>

880
00:24:58.410 --> 00:24:59.840
<v Speaker 1>There are no pants big enough.</v>

881
00:24:59.841 --> 00:25:00.551
<v Speaker 1>It's angry.</v>

882
00:25:00.551 --> 00:25:01.384
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to,</v>

883
00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:02.470
<v Speaker 1>it's on the move.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Constantly presents or boundaries of cloth to clean.</v>

886
00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.513

<v Speaker 1>Dick Rogan.</v>

890
00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:16.210
<v Speaker 1>Rogan isn't even that big.</v>

891
00:25:16.211 --> 00:25:17.044
<v Speaker 1>It's just crazy</v>

892
00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:21.443
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it.</v>

893
00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:25.090
<v Speaker 1>If you had like a fucking drunk kangaroo or a wild vicious rat,</v>

894
00:25:25.091 --> 00:25:26.110
<v Speaker 1>I'd be more scared of the rat.</v>

895
00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:26.381
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

896

903
00:25:35.261 --> 00:25:37.180
<v Speaker 1>I had a bad situation with a rat,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Me and my friend John went to this place to play pool and there's this fucking</v>

907
00:25:42.191 --> 00:25:43.370

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:53.980
<v Speaker 1>I have a great rat story.</v>

912
00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:55.923
<v Speaker 1>This is a good one.</v>

913
00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:01.093
<v Speaker 1>She's not as,</v>

914
00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:05.350
<v Speaker 1>I like oil.</v>

915
00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:06.330
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty dark.</v>

916
00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:08.050
<v Speaker 1>So let me,</v>

917
00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.840
<v Speaker 1>let me paint this with my tone.</v>

918
00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:11.500
<v Speaker 1>Dark,</v>

919
00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:12.333
<v Speaker 1>dark,</v>

920
00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:13.100
<v Speaker 1>dark.</v>

921
00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:16.690
<v Speaker 1>So I used to work in retail and the story.</v>

922
00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:17.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

923
00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.273
<v Speaker 1>let's call it.</v>

924
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.620
<v Speaker 1>That's actually really loud.</v>

925
00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:24.500
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

926
00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:24.951
<v Speaker 1>I'll stop.</v>

927
00:26:24.951 --> 00:26:25.784
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

928
00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:31.960
<v Speaker 1>So I was working in retail and it was a horrible job.</v>

929
00:26:31.961 --> 00:26:36.850
<v Speaker 1>It was like totally degrading as a human and all you would do is fold clothes</v>

930
00:26:36.851 --> 00:26:37.310
<v Speaker 1>all day.</v>

931
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:41.140
<v Speaker 1>It was really expensive and these people would come in and spend ridiculous</v>

932
00:26:41.141 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 1>amounts of money on clothes and they were just shitty and mean</v>

933
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.210
<v Speaker 5>and rude and rich,</v>

934
00:26:45.211 --> 00:26:45.960
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

935
00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.340
<v Speaker 5>Not that that all constitutes,</v>

936
00:26:47.341 --> 00:26:47.710
<v Speaker 5>but it,</v>

937
00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:49.680
<v Speaker 5>it was just an unpleasant experience.</v>

938
00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:54.160
<v Speaker 5>And from whether it was a customer or the staff that,</v>

939
00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:54.601
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

940
00:26:54.601 --> 00:26:57.810
<v Speaker 5>my employers were just not kind and they didn't give a shit about you.</v>

941
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:59.970
<v Speaker 5>So I was already,</v>

942
00:26:59.971 --> 00:27:04.320
<v Speaker 5>I knew I was kind of walking on thin ice because I wasn't like enthusiastic</v>

943
00:27:04.321 --> 00:27:04.891
<v Speaker 5>about being there.</v>

944
00:27:04.891 --> 00:27:05.724
<v Speaker 5>It was just a job.</v>

945
00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.320
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

946
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:12.350
<v Speaker 5>one day before the biggest sale of the year where people like late ladies freak</v>

947
00:27:12.961 --> 00:27:13.794
<v Speaker 5>out,</v>

948
00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:17.190
<v Speaker 5>I came into the store and that weekend there had been like,</v>

949
00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:21.090
<v Speaker 5>there had been indications and evidence that there were rodents because,</v>

950
00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:21.881
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>

951
00:27:21.881 --> 00:27:22.351
<v Speaker 5>and you know what?</v>

952
00:27:22.351 --> 00:27:24.360
<v Speaker 5>I knew it were rats cause I could smell them.</v>

953
00:27:24.361 --> 00:27:24.901
<v Speaker 5>I swear to God.</v>

954
00:27:24.901 --> 00:27:25.440
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

955
00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.190
<v Speaker 5>I could smell.</v>

956
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:27.720
<v Speaker 5>Literally when someone says I can smell a rat,</v>

957
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:29.370
<v Speaker 5>there's a musty smell to them,</v>

958
00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:30.930
<v Speaker 5>you can fucking smell them.</v>

959
00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:31.853
<v Speaker 5>I never saw,</v>

960
00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:32.131
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

961
00:27:32.131 --> 00:27:32.791
<v Speaker 5>it's totally,</v>

962
00:27:32.791 --> 00:27:34.380
<v Speaker 5>cause my first house in La,</v>

963
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.510
<v Speaker 5>I moved into off of a craigslist ad,</v>

964
00:27:36.511 --> 00:27:38.900
<v Speaker 5>had rats and I knew I was like that smell light.</v>

965
00:27:38.901 --> 00:27:39.750
<v Speaker 5>I know that smell.</v>

966
00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.160
<v Speaker 5>That was from my old house.</v>

967
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:42.023
<v Speaker 5>That's a rat.</v>

968
00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.520
<v Speaker 5>So long story short,</v>

969
00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:46.320
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

970
00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.660
<v Speaker 5>the exterminators come in and set traps the night before.</v>

971
00:27:48.661 --> 00:27:51.510
<v Speaker 5>So Saturday morning when like this big sale starts,</v>

972
00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:52.081
<v Speaker 5>every,</v>

973
00:27:52.081 --> 00:27:52.771
<v Speaker 5>all the girls were like,</v>

974
00:27:52.771 --> 00:27:53.440
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

975
00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.360
<v Speaker 5>you think they call it something?</v>

976
00:27:54.361 --> 00:27:55.194
<v Speaker 5>I Dunno.</v>

977
00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:58.920
<v Speaker 5>We walk into the store and there's like,</v>

978
00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:00.480
<v Speaker 5>there's one dead rat upstairs,</v>

979
00:28:00.481 --> 00:28:03.570
<v Speaker 5>there's one in the traps downstairs and the other one downstairs.</v>

980
00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:05.430
<v Speaker 5>And then there was another,</v>

981
00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:10.520
<v Speaker 5>there was a trap that had been deployed and there was a piece of a big large</v>

982
00:28:11.551 --> 00:28:14.490
<v Speaker 5>piece of a tail and blood.</v>

983
00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.530
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking blood all over the clothes,</v>

984
00:28:16.531 --> 00:28:17.640
<v Speaker 5>all over the wall,</v>

985
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:18.833
<v Speaker 5>but no rat.</v>

986
00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:23.610
<v Speaker 5>And one of the girls had walked into the front of the,</v>

987
00:28:23.611 --> 00:28:24.390
<v Speaker 5>of the store.</v>

988
00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:28.140
<v Speaker 5>And also you should know there was a line forming outside of people that wanted</v>

989
00:28:28.141 --> 00:28:30.360
<v Speaker 5>to get in to get this end of the year sale.</v>

990
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:33.000
<v Speaker 5>One of the girls walks in,</v>

991
00:28:33.001 --> 00:28:33.270
<v Speaker 5>she goes,</v>

992
00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:33.421
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

993
00:28:33.421 --> 00:28:34.254
<v Speaker 5>with that,</v>

994
00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:38.820
<v Speaker 5>and it was the size of a cat and it was the rat that got that got out of the</v>

995
00:28:38.821 --> 00:28:43.050
<v Speaker 5>trap that like lost its tail was in the middle of the store bleeding.</v>

996
00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.730
<v Speaker 5>And it was like this big,</v>

997
00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.080
<v Speaker 5>everybody's freaking out.</v>

998
00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:49.020
<v Speaker 5>One of the girls was ballsy enough to throw trash can over it.</v>

999
00:28:49.021 --> 00:28:49.854
<v Speaker 5>So it's like,</v>

1000
00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:50.251
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1001
00:28:50.251 --> 00:28:52.720
<v Speaker 5>it's like screaming in this and so,</v>

1002
00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:54.270
<v Speaker 5>so at this point,</v>

1003
00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.051
<v Speaker 5>at this point,</v>

1004
00:28:55.051 --> 00:28:55.890
<v Speaker 5>it's time.</v>

1005
00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.730
<v Speaker 5>It is time to,</v>

1006
00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.270
<v Speaker 5>to open the store and all that.</v>

1007
00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:01.500
<v Speaker 5>People are knocking on the window and we were able to,</v>

1008
00:29:01.501 --> 00:29:01.980
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1009
00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:05.160
<v Speaker 5>we were able to sort of create a diversion and put some clothes,</v>

1010
00:29:05.161 --> 00:29:10.161
<v Speaker 5>racks so you couldn't see the trashcan people in while they were [inaudible] the</v>

1011
00:29:10.591 --> 00:29:11.040
<v Speaker 5>window.</v>

1012
00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:11.873
<v Speaker 5>Nobody was letting,</v>

1013
00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:13.081
<v Speaker 5>this was like a,</v>

1014
00:29:13.081 --> 00:29:17.310
<v Speaker 5>it was screaming like you couldn't no one [inaudible] so we call the</v>

1015
00:29:17.311 --> 00:29:18.144
<v Speaker 5>exterminator.</v>

1016
00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:19.320
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1036
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:43.630
<v Speaker 5>So in the next thing I know he walks out to his truck and he comes back with a</v>

1037
00:29:43.631 --> 00:29:45.630
<v Speaker 5>two by four and he's like,</v>

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:47.591
<v Speaker 5>I don't feel,</v>

00:30:47.591 --> 00:30:49.060
<v Speaker 5>I know that you want to be a musician.</v>

00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:54.003
<v Speaker 5>But anyway,</v>

1086
00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:54.963
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1087
00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:58.750
<v Speaker 5>you couldn't fire me before he made me clean up the rats blood.</v>

1088
00:30:58.751 --> 00:30:59.890
<v Speaker 5>I had to clean up the blood.</v>

1089
00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:00.351

<v Speaker 4>Are you fucking kidding me?</v>

1092
00:31:03.001 --> 00:31:04.800
<v Speaker 4>Like it was one of those moments where I literally,</v>

1093
00:31:04.801 --> 00:31:06.750
<v Speaker 4>I lost my shit and then she was like,</v>

1094
00:31:06.751 --> 00:31:06.871
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1095
00:31:06.871 --> 00:31:08.730
<v Speaker 4>you can stay for the rest of the day if you want.</v>

1096
00:31:08.731 --> 00:31:09.260
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1097
00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:11.310
<v Speaker 4>you think I want to stay here and look at you.</v>

1098
00:31:11.311 --> 00:31:12.260
<v Speaker 4>I hate you.</v>

1099
00:31:12.261 --> 00:31:12.960
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1100
00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:13.800
<v Speaker 4>horrible.</v>

1101
00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:15.570
<v Speaker 5>But it's such a good story.</v>

1102
00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.920
<v Speaker 4>So going through it was all worth it at the time.</v>

1103
00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:22.761
<v Speaker 4>Well it was just,</v>

1104
00:31:22.761 --> 00:31:23.600
<v Speaker 4>I'd never like,</v>

1105
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:25.820
<v Speaker 4>I'd never experienced like any,</v>

1106
00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:28.250
<v Speaker 4>it's such a fantastical story.</v>

1107
00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:29.743
<v Speaker 4>Fantastical.</v>

1108
00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:30.793
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

1109
00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:35.270
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it funny how story that is absolutely horrible at the time becomes</v>

1110
00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:36.200
<v Speaker 4>awesome.</v>

1111
00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:36.561
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

1112
00:31:36.561 --> 00:31:37.394
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

1113
00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:38.530
<v Speaker 4>it was a low point.</v>

1114
00:31:38.531 --> 00:31:40.380
<v Speaker 4>It was a low point though cause it was so insane.</v>

1115
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:44.510
<v Speaker 4>Like when someone in in like dig like just degrades you like that.</v>

1116
00:31:44.511 --> 00:31:45.231
<v Speaker 4>Like she said,</v>

1117
00:31:45.231 --> 00:31:47.840
<v Speaker 4>I know you're trying to be a musician but like your heart's on in it.</v>

1118
00:31:47.841 --> 00:31:48.201
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

1119
00:31:48.201 --> 00:31:50.020
<v Speaker 4>of course I don't want to</v>

1120
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:52.663
<v Speaker 4>cleaning up.</v>

1121
00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:54.743
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>

1122
00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:06.570
<v Speaker 4>I was explaining this to me this weekend about struggle and it's a very</v>

1123
00:32:07.581 --> 00:32:08.330
<v Speaker 4>important,</v>

1124
00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:09.170
<v Speaker 4>interesting point.</v>

1125
00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:10.730
<v Speaker 4>And he was talking about working,</v>

1126
00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:12.440
<v Speaker 4>struggling really hard,</v>

1127
00:32:12.441 --> 00:32:13.760
<v Speaker 4>doing something that sucks.</v>

1128
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.440
<v Speaker 4>It's not fun at the time,</v>

1129
00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:18.740
<v Speaker 4>but it's fun later on for a long time.</v>

1130
00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:21.140
<v Speaker 4>Whereas something that comes really easy,</v>

1131
00:32:21.141 --> 00:32:21.891
<v Speaker 4>like fun,</v>

1132
00:32:21.891 --> 00:32:25.400
<v Speaker 4>like rollercoaster riding is fun at the time,</v>

1133
00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:29.030
<v Speaker 4>but after it's over has no fun attached to it anymore.</v>

1134
00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:29.421
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1135
00:32:29.421 --> 00:32:29.961
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

1136
00:32:29.961 --> 00:32:30.980
<v Speaker 4>That is crazy.</v>

1137
00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:32.630
<v Speaker 4>Because if you think about it that way,</v>

1138
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:35.120
<v Speaker 4>there's fun stored up.</v>

1139
00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:38.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1140
00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.140
<v Speaker 4>But even if you have,</v>

1141
00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:40.320
<v Speaker 4>it's still 30 seconds.</v>

1142
00:32:40.321 --> 00:32:40.731
<v Speaker 4>It's woo,</v>

1143
00:32:40.731 --> 00:32:41.600
<v Speaker 4>we did it was crazy.</v>

1144
00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:42.950
<v Speaker 4>And then you kind of tell it,</v>

1145
00:32:42.951 --> 00:32:47.930
<v Speaker 4>but you just told the fucking harrowing story of a rat trapped under the</v>

1146
00:32:47.931 --> 00:32:51.980
<v Speaker 4>trashcan shrieking why a bunch of chicks are banging on the window and trying to</v>

1147
00:32:51.981 --> 00:32:56.290
<v Speaker 4>save some money and it's just fucking Rad and the guy comes in and smashed.</v>

1148
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:59.900
<v Speaker 4>It is a great fucking story that at the time he must have been like,</v>

1149
00:32:59.901 --> 00:33:03.350
<v Speaker 4>fuck this job and you fucking fire me fucking of that day.</v>

1150
00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:04.580
<v Speaker 4>Like immediately afterwards,</v>

1151
00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:06.890
<v Speaker 4>look how great it is now.</v>

1152
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:07.720
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's been,</v>

1153
00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:12.720
<v Speaker 4>there was like energy stored up in that moment that's come through in a big way.</v>

1154
00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:19.490
<v Speaker 4>We missing amazing crazy like acts of nature like that in any respect.</v>

1155
00:33:19.491 --> 00:33:21.800

1156
00:33:21.801 --> 00:33:22.041
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1157
00:33:22.041 --> 00:33:22.550

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:27.410
<v Speaker 4>Well I've been talking about this the last few days I've been really happy.</v>

1160
00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:28.090
<v Speaker 4>Like about,</v>

1161
00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:29.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm always pretty happy,</v>

1162
00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:34.180
<v Speaker 4>but it's really fucking happy because I'm not in the fucking rain forest in</v>

1163
00:33:35.061 --> 00:33:40.061
<v Speaker 4>Prince Edwards Island in Alaska was sleeping in a wet tent and I'm like,</v>

1164
00:33:40.611 --> 00:33:40.851
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

1165
00:33:40.851 --> 00:33:41.960
<v Speaker 4>houses are awesome.</v>

1166
00:33:41.961 --> 00:33:42.650
<v Speaker 4>Plumbing,</v>

1167
00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:43.483
<v Speaker 4>electricity,</v>

1168
00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:45.930
<v Speaker 4>everything was wearing.</v>

1169
00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:47.630
<v Speaker 4>My sleeping bag was wet,</v>

1170
00:33:47.631 --> 00:33:48.464
<v Speaker 4>my clothes are wet.</v>

1171
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:49.760
<v Speaker 4>I turned my light on.</v>

1172
00:33:49.761 --> 00:33:52.550
<v Speaker 4>I had a miner's light on when those little things you put on like a little</v>

1173
00:33:52.551 --> 00:33:54.830
<v Speaker 4>headband sits over the forehead,</v>

1174
00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:55.693
<v Speaker 4>like a third eye,</v>

1175
00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:56.953
<v Speaker 4>your enlightenment.</v>

1176
00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.210
<v Speaker 4>I turned this thing on in my,</v>

1177
00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:03.630
<v Speaker 4>in my tent and I just saw like it was raining do drops.</v>

1178
00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:07.250
<v Speaker 4>It's like literally everywhere you looked like the entire air,</v>

1179
00:34:07.251 --> 00:34:09.170
<v Speaker 4>all the air was filled with moisture.</v>

1180
00:34:09.410 --> 00:34:12.080
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing stays dry if possible.</v>

1181
00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:14.510
<v Speaker 4>We just hate like freeze dried foods.</v>

1182
00:34:14.511 --> 00:34:15.051
<v Speaker 4>You take walk.</v>

1183
00:34:15.051 --> 00:34:16.510
<v Speaker 4>We was drinking right out of the leg.</v>

1184
00:34:16.910 --> 00:34:17.743
<v Speaker 4>Five days,</v>

1185
00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:19.310
<v Speaker 4>we're drinking right out of the lake.</v>

1186
00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:20.500
<v Speaker 4>You just dip your,</v>

1187
00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:24.620
<v Speaker 4>there's no Giardia because there's no beavers up that high,</v>

1188
00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:25.713
<v Speaker 4>and not only that,</v>

1189
00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:26.021
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1190
00:34:26.021 --> 00:34:28.340
<v Speaker 4>it's a lake that's made entirely rainwater.</v>

1191
00:34:28.341 --> 00:34:29.960
<v Speaker 4>It's not fed by a river or anything.</v>

1192
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:30.541
<v Speaker 4>What did he say?</v>

1193
00:34:30.541 --> 00:34:31.790
<v Speaker 4>It rains so much.</v>

1194
00:34:31.791 --> 00:34:33.020
<v Speaker 4>It's just pure rainwater</v>

1195
00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:35.803
<v Speaker 4>tributaries,</v>

1196
00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:36.950
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>

1197
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:38.990
<v Speaker 4>It's 160 inches of rain a year.</v>

1198
00:34:38.991 --> 00:34:40.580
<v Speaker 4>It's the rainiest spot in North America.</v>

1199
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:41.810
<v Speaker 4>She just dip your cleaning.</v>

1200
00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:43.363
<v Speaker 4>Huge.</v>

1201
00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.480
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

1202
00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:45.740
<v Speaker 4>I'll show you some pictures after the,</v>

1203
00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:47.140
<v Speaker 4>after the podcast sober.</v>

1204
00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:48.290
<v Speaker 4>This is amazing.</v>

1205
00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:49.550
<v Speaker 4>It's so humbling,</v>

1206
00:34:49.551 --> 00:34:51.260
<v Speaker 4>but beautiful.</v>

1207
00:34:51.261 --> 00:34:52.160
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>

1208
00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:52.640
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1209
00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:54.650
<v Speaker 4>solitary like really wild.</v>

1210
00:34:54.651 --> 00:34:56.570
<v Speaker 4>But when you get back home you feel great.</v>

1211
00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:57.200
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1212
00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.580
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the balance.</v>

1213
00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:01.010
<v Speaker 4>I don't think the balance is living by herself.</v>

1214
00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.050
<v Speaker 4>I don't think the balance is going off Ted Kaczynski.</v>

1215
00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.930
<v Speaker 4>I think the balance is going out to nature.</v>

1216
00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm going out on the limb,</v>

1217
00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:14.840
<v Speaker 4>but I think the balance is going out into nature and being around people.</v>

1218
00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:15.610
<v Speaker 4>It's like both.</v>

1219
00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:16.250
<v Speaker 4>Definitely.</v>

1220
00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:17.510
<v Speaker 4>It's like both like a nice</v>

1221
00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:20.601
<v Speaker 4>exchange.</v>

1222
00:35:20.601 --> 00:35:21.171
<v Speaker 4>That energy,</v>

1223
00:35:21.171 --> 00:35:24.010
<v Speaker 4>whether it's like physical contact or just you know,</v>

1224
00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:27.710
<v Speaker 4>attention perspective and be seeing the stars.</v>

1225
00:35:27.711 --> 00:35:28.371
<v Speaker 4>That's a huge,</v>

1226
00:35:28.371 --> 00:35:29.000
<v Speaker 4>huge,</v>

1227
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:29.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1228
00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:29.870
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

1229
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:30.230
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

1230
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:34.700
<v Speaker 4>we just got to go to Hawaii fairly recently and you look up at the stars and you</v>

1231
00:35:34.701 --> 00:35:35.900
<v Speaker 4>see the Keck observatory.</v>

1232
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.611
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1233
00:35:36.611 --> 00:35:36.960
<v Speaker 4>he did.</v>

1234
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:37.830
<v Speaker 4>He got to go</v>

1235
00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:39.180
<v Speaker 6>your life.</v>

1236
00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:40.020
<v Speaker 6>It's in Hawaii.</v>

1237
00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:40.920
<v Speaker 6>It's on the big island.</v>

1238
00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:41.290
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1239
00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:41.911
<v Speaker 6>that's where we were.</v>

1240
00:35:41.911 --> 00:35:42.640
<v Speaker 6>Shit too.</v>

1241
00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:43.260
<v Speaker 6>Maybe we'll go back.</v>

1242
00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:43.650
<v Speaker 6>You got,</v>

1243
00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:45.180
<v Speaker 6>I'm scheduling my next trip.</v>

1244
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:48.480
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to make sure if I go there that I go there when and when there's no</v>

1245
00:35:48.481 --> 00:35:51.180
<v Speaker 6>moon out because the last time I went it was fucking amazing.</v>

1246
00:35:51.181 --> 00:35:53.520
<v Speaker 6>But the moon was out so you don't see anything but the moon.</v>

1247
00:35:53.521 --> 00:35:54.354
<v Speaker 6>A few stars.</v>

1248
00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.100
<v Speaker 6>But the time before I went,</v>

1249
00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:57.630
<v Speaker 6>it was all stars.</v>

1250
00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.340
<v Speaker 6>It was Warren Moon and it's insane.</v>

1251
00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:00.540
<v Speaker 6>You can't believe,</v>

1252
00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:03.000
<v Speaker 6>you almost get angry that you can't see that every day.</v>

1253
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:05.520
<v Speaker 6>Everybody should see it on a regular basis.</v>

1254
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:06.840
<v Speaker 6>If you get to do it every night,</v>

1255
00:36:06.841 --> 00:36:08.400
<v Speaker 6>it should happen regular,</v>

1256
00:36:08.401 --> 00:36:08.851
<v Speaker 6>weekly,</v>

1257
00:36:08.851 --> 00:36:09.181
<v Speaker 6>monthly,</v>

1258
00:36:09.181 --> 00:36:09.630
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

1259
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:13.600
<v Speaker 6>Cause it just sets you back to the point of understanding what is actually going</v>

1260
00:36:13.601 --> 00:36:13.671
<v Speaker 6>on,</v>

1261
00:36:13.671 --> 00:36:14.330
<v Speaker 6>where you are.</v>

1262
00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:14.610
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1263
00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:15.031
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

1264
00:36:15.031 --> 00:36:15.390
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1265
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:15.541
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1266
00:36:15.541 --> 00:36:15.961
<v Speaker 6>I think we're,</v>

1267
00:36:15.961 --> 00:36:16.794
<v Speaker 6>we're blocked off.</v>

1268
00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:19.140
<v Speaker 6>We're in a car with like super tinted windows.</v>

1269
00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:20.581
<v Speaker 6>We look so cool.</v>

1270
00:36:20.581 --> 00:36:21.414
<v Speaker 6>You can't see,</v>

1271
00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:23.080
<v Speaker 6>we're obviously success dark out.</v>

1272
00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:23.973
<v Speaker 5>We can't see shit</v>

1273
00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:27.690
<v Speaker 5>obviously successful or being abducted.</v>

1274
00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:28.863
<v Speaker 5>It's one or the other.</v>

1275
00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:32.730
<v Speaker 5>You've maybe porn being filled one of the biggest one or the other.</v>

1276
00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:38.800
<v Speaker 6>But when we're flying around through the galaxy and we don't realize it,</v>

1277
00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:39.730
<v Speaker 6>we can get cocky,</v>

1278
00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:41.020
<v Speaker 6>but when you're standing,</v>

1279
00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:44.710
<v Speaker 6>you're standing on the Keck observatory and looking up and you see the very</v>

1280
00:36:44.711 --> 00:36:46.960
<v Speaker 6>defined Milky Way Galaxy.</v>

1281
00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:48.190
<v Speaker 6>It's so,</v>

1282
00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:49.031
<v Speaker 6>it's so crazy.</v>

1283
00:36:49.031 --> 00:36:50.050
<v Speaker 6>It's like you're,</v>

1284
00:36:50.051 --> 00:36:55.051
<v Speaker 6>you are literally on some sort of a spaceship flying with no roof and you're</v>

1285
00:36:55.511 --> 00:36:58.210
<v Speaker 6>flying through the galaxy and that's what it feels like.</v>

1286
00:36:58.420 --> 00:36:58.721
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

1287
00:36:58.721 --> 00:36:59.560
<v Speaker 6>it's everything is,</v>

1288
00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:00.970
<v Speaker 6>you just feel so small.</v>

1289
00:37:00.971 --> 00:37:01.151
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

1290
00:37:01.151 --> 00:37:01.361
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

1291
00:37:01.361 --> 00:37:04.550
<v Speaker 6>this is fucking huge feeling of small though.</v>

1292
00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.320
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

1293
00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:07.510
<v Speaker 6>Because it's not really that you feel small.</v>

1294
00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:10.240
<v Speaker 6>It's that you realize the enormity of it.</v>

1295
00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:11.373
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1296
00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:12.273
<v Speaker 6>Everything,</v>

1297
00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:13.450
<v Speaker 6>the whole package.</v>

1298
00:37:13.451 --> 00:37:13.721
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

1299
00:37:13.721 --> 00:37:14.830
<v Speaker 6>not even that you feel small.</v>

1300
00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:15.611
<v Speaker 6>It's just like,</v>

1301
00:37:15.611 --> 00:37:19.180
<v Speaker 6>it's humbling and I think that's one of the reasons why people are so God damn</v>

1302
00:37:19.181 --> 00:37:19.900
<v Speaker 6>cocky.</v>

1303
00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:20.970
<v Speaker 6>I think we fucked up.</v>

1304
00:37:20.971 --> 00:37:23.170
<v Speaker 6>I'm making like lights everywhere at night.</v>

1305
00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:25.380
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1306
00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:26.340
<v Speaker 5>I think it's what he said.</v>

1307
00:37:26.341 --> 00:37:27.121
<v Speaker 5>It's a balance.</v>

1308
00:37:27.121 --> 00:37:27.421
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1309
00:37:27.421 --> 00:37:27.750
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1310
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:29.400
<v Speaker 5>people need to remember to get away,</v>

1311
00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:30.421
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1312
00:37:30.421 --> 00:37:32.220
<v Speaker 5>and reflect and be out shut.</v>

1313
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.210
<v Speaker 5>Shut it down.</v>

1314
00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:34.290
<v Speaker 5>Turn your fucking phone off.</v>

1315
00:37:34.291 --> 00:37:34.561
<v Speaker 5>Don't,</v>

1316
00:37:34.561 --> 00:37:35.970
<v Speaker 5>don't look at your Facebook page.</v>

1317
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:36.300
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1318
00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:37.830
<v Speaker 5>Go be outside,</v>

1319
00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:38.790
<v Speaker 5>just take it in.</v>

1320
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.110
<v Speaker 5>I kind of felt like that when I,</v>

1321
00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:41.760
<v Speaker 5>I spent a summer surfing.</v>

1322
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:43.230
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a good surfer,</v>

1323
00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:43.801
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1324
00:37:43.801 --> 00:37:44.370
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1325
00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:44.620
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1326
00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:46.170
<v Speaker 5>I used to live by the beach and I,</v>

1327
00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:49.320
<v Speaker 5>I diligently would go with a friend of mine who was teaching me how to surf.</v>

1328
00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:50.040
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1329
00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:50.873
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1330
00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:51.950
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1331
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:53.280
<v Speaker 5>I had so many moments where like,</v>

1332
00:37:53.281 --> 00:37:55.440
<v Speaker 5>I was getting tossed around and you know,</v>

1333
00:37:55.441 --> 00:37:56.140
<v Speaker 5>where I,</v>

1334
00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:56.973
<v Speaker 5>I was scared.</v>

1335
00:37:57.450 --> 00:37:59.580
<v Speaker 5>And you just feel like this is,</v>

1336
00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:00.750
<v Speaker 5>this is the ocean,</v>

1337
00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:01.410
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>

1338
00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:02.520
<v Speaker 5>this is huge.</v>

1339
00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:04.680
<v Speaker 5>This is so much bigger than,</v>

1340
00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:05.670
<v Speaker 5>than me.</v>

1341
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:06.091
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1342
00:38:06.091 --> 00:38:06.411
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>

1343
00:38:06.411 --> 00:38:07.920
<v Speaker 5>I had so much respect for,</v>

1344
00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:09.053
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1345
00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:10.440
<v Speaker 5>great mother nature.</v>

1346
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:11.370
<v Speaker 5>It's a model I did,</v>

1347
00:38:11.371 --> 00:38:11.970
<v Speaker 5>but it did.</v>

1348
00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:12.691
<v Speaker 5>I really did.</v>

1349
00:38:12.691 --> 00:38:12.841
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1350
00:38:12.841 --> 00:38:14.100
<v Speaker 5>I would have these moments where I would just,</v>

1351
00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:17.430
<v Speaker 5>I would get up at like six in the morning with my friend and go surfing and then</v>

1352
00:38:17.431 --> 00:38:21.240
<v Speaker 5>have this just awareness for the rest of my day and it's pretty fucking cool.</v>

1353
00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:23.040
<v Speaker 5>I would imagine that the people that,</v>

1354
00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:24.083
<v Speaker 5>that surf,</v>

1355
00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:24.840
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1356
00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:26.370
<v Speaker 5>frequently that that's their hobby,</v>

1357
00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:27.030
<v Speaker 5>have it,</v>

1358
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:30.330
<v Speaker 5>have a real essence about them.</v>

1359
00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:32.690
<v Speaker 5>This is definitely a spiritual connection.</v>

1360
00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:33.170
<v Speaker 5>Toad.</v>

1361
00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:36.220
<v Speaker 5>It was a little lime energy that's so much more powerful</v>

1362
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:37.870
<v Speaker 4>than you when you were riding that wave.</v>

1363
00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:41.080
<v Speaker 4>It was just people that just go to the beach every day,</v>

1364
00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:41.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1365
00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:43.390
<v Speaker 4>or I'll all the time like this.</v>

1366
00:38:43.391 --> 00:38:47.140
<v Speaker 4>One of the reasons my beach towns are so chill isn't something about the salt</v>

1367
00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:49.930
<v Speaker 4>like alkalizing or something good for you.</v>

1368
00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:51.520
<v Speaker 4>It's very cleansing.</v>

1369
00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:55.090
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine like if you go by like Santa Monica and you watched the waves,</v>

1370
00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:55.781
<v Speaker 4>like you'll,</v>

1371
00:38:55.781 --> 00:38:57.030
<v Speaker 4>he see the mist it,</v>

1372
00:38:57.031 --> 00:39:00.080
<v Speaker 4>you'd see the met like people are breathing that and the air's clean.</v>

1373
00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:01.380
<v Speaker 4>This shit we wouldn't hear.</v>

1374
00:39:01.381 --> 00:39:04.060
<v Speaker 4>This is a fucking hundred million cars and the air's clean there cause it's all</v>

1375
00:39:04.061 --> 00:39:04.930
<v Speaker 4>coming off the ocean.</v>

1376
00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.760
<v Speaker 4>It's just totally different sort of vibe.</v>

1377
00:39:06.761 --> 00:39:07.810
<v Speaker 4>It's a totally different life.</v>

1378
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:10.810
<v Speaker 4>I mean what are we living by the beach guys?</v>

1379
00:39:10.811 --> 00:39:13.780
<v Speaker 4>So we have both of those live on the beach and the stars.</v>

1380
00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:16.840
<v Speaker 4>But the stars I think at that motherfucker of all motherfuckers,</v>

1381
00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:17.580
<v Speaker 4>it's like the,</v>

1382
00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:18.620
<v Speaker 4>the forest too though.</v>

1383
00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:19.950
<v Speaker 4>Forest.</v>

1384
00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:23.460
<v Speaker 4>Well everywhere.</v>

1385
00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:25.330
<v Speaker 4>I mean Hawaii is amazing too.</v>

1386
00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:26.260
<v Speaker 4>I was in Hilo,</v>

1387
00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:30.700
<v Speaker 4>went through Hilo and he drove like the mountain.</v>

1388
00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:32.980
<v Speaker 4>The Hilo is just one of the cities in Hawaii.</v>

1389
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:34.383
<v Speaker 4>Are you thinking about Kona</v>

1390
00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:36.733
<v Speaker 4>on the Big Island?</v>

1391
00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:37.570
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about wife who,</v>

1392
00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:38.380
<v Speaker 4>we were just,</v>

1393
00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:38.921
<v Speaker 4>we were there.</v>

1394
00:39:38.921 --> 00:39:40.390
<v Speaker 4>There was this canyon,</v>

1395
00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:41.050
<v Speaker 4>is that what,</v>

1396
00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:42.100
<v Speaker 4>what the by the water?</v>

1397
00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:42.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1398
00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:47.170
<v Speaker 4>There was this literally thousand foot waterfall running right off the north</v>

1399
00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:49.150
<v Speaker 4>west coast of the island.</v>

1400
00:39:49.151 --> 00:39:50.170
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the big island.</v>

1401
00:39:50.171 --> 00:39:50.291
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1402
00:39:50.291 --> 00:39:50.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1403
00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:51.453
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1404
00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:52.840
<v Speaker 4>It looks like drastic park.</v>

1405
00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:55.420
<v Speaker 4>Legitimately like didn't they film that?</v>

1406
00:39:55.421 --> 00:39:56.290
<v Speaker 4>They're probably,</v>

1407
00:39:56.291 --> 00:39:57.260
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine they did.</v>

1408
00:39:57.790 --> 00:39:59.110
<v Speaker 4>I think they did on a Wahoo.</v>

1409
00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:00.340
<v Speaker 4>They bought last.</v>

1410
00:40:00.341 --> 00:40:00.611
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1411
00:40:00.611 --> 00:40:01.444
<v Speaker 4>they film bar.</v>

1412
00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:03.743
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>

1413
00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:07.560
<v Speaker 4>We went in July with some really good friends of ours and um,</v>

1414
00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:08.140
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1415
00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:10.090
<v Speaker 4>I've personally never been anywhere tropical,</v>

1416
00:40:10.091 --> 00:40:11.230
<v Speaker 4>so that was my first time.</v>

1417
00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:14.290
<v Speaker 4>Hawaii was your first tropical trip like two months ago.</v>

1418
00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:14.981
<v Speaker 4>And it's the best,</v>

1419
00:40:14.981 --> 00:40:15.071
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

1420
00:40:15.071 --> 00:40:16.240
<v Speaker 4>It such a crazy one too,</v>

1421
00:40:16.241 --> 00:40:17.590
<v Speaker 4>because it's not just tropical,</v>

1422
00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:17.901
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1423
00:40:17.901 --> 00:40:21.520
<v Speaker 4>there's the rain forest every like the volcanic fields and the people are cool</v>

1424
00:40:21.521 --> 00:40:22.300
<v Speaker 4>as shit.</v>

1425
00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:23.500
<v Speaker 4>I love people.</v>

1426
00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:24.461
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1427
00:40:24.461 --> 00:40:25.570
<v Speaker 4>people always say like you,</v>

1428
00:40:25.571 --> 00:40:25.811
<v Speaker 4>you'll,</v>

1429
00:40:25.811 --> 00:40:27.060
<v Speaker 4>you'll hear that like Hawaiians,</v>

1430
00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:28.720
<v Speaker 4>like negative towards white people,</v>

1431
00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:29.231
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1432
00:40:29.231 --> 00:40:30.730
<v Speaker 4>a negative towards mainlanders.</v>

1433
00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:33.490
<v Speaker 4>But I just think there's too many of us that are Douche bags.</v>

1434
00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:34.793
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is.</v>

1435
00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:38.960
<v Speaker 4>We come over there and my fucking airplane ticket costs.</v>

1436
00:40:38.961 --> 00:40:41.200
<v Speaker 4>You get over here to your fucking stupid island man.</v>

1437
00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:42.993
<v Speaker 4>And these people are like,</v>

1438
00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.490
<v Speaker 4>my ancestors came over here in a fucking canoe.</v>

1439
00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:46.333
<v Speaker 4>Bitch,</v>

1440
00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:48.580
<v Speaker 4>it's tough people.</v>

1441
00:40:48.581 --> 00:40:49.414
<v Speaker 4>Fuck man.</v>

1442
00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:50.860
<v Speaker 4>What could we could,</v>

1443
00:40:50.861 --> 00:40:53.110
<v Speaker 4>we met this guy named [inaudible] Veka and he was helping,</v>

1444
00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:56.440
<v Speaker 4>we were staying in a place that was literally right on the beach so we could</v>

1445
00:40:56.441 --> 00:40:59.890
<v Speaker 4>walk out 20 yards and be snorkeling.</v>

1446
00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:04.270
<v Speaker 4>And he was just instructing us about the wildlife.</v>

1447
00:41:04.271 --> 00:41:05.104
<v Speaker 4>Don't touch that.</v>

1448
00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:06.743
<v Speaker 4>He</v>

1449
00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.300
<v Speaker 4>had learned in set in,</v>

1450
00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:10.810
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>

1451
00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:12.670
<v Speaker 4>in a way that he would've just shrugged off.</v>

1452
00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:12.940
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1453
00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:14.170
<v Speaker 4>he just brushed it off his shoulder.</v>

1454
00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:16.780
<v Speaker 4>This dude got an urgent or some sort of spine.</v>

1455
00:41:16.781 --> 00:41:19.480
<v Speaker 4>I wish I knew what spiky ones.</v>

1456
00:41:19.481 --> 00:41:20.640
<v Speaker 4>He got to one of those and they didn't put,</v>

1457
00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:21.790
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1458
00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:24.040
<v Speaker 4>this dude had it impaled through his wrist.</v>

1459
00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:24.520
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

1460
00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:25.390
<v Speaker 4>And you can't take it out.</v>

1461
00:41:25.391 --> 00:41:26.224
<v Speaker 4>It's too brittle.</v>

1462
00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:27.940
<v Speaker 4>He had it in his risk for a year.</v>

1463
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.871
<v Speaker 4>It just happens.</v>

1464
00:41:28.871 --> 00:41:29.704
<v Speaker 4>It just slowly,</v>

1465
00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:31.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1466
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:31.271
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1467
00:41:31.271 --> 00:41:31.550
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1468
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:36.550
<v Speaker 4>that's both had you had one on your thumb and I had one on my foot and like I</v>

1469
00:41:36.771 --> 00:41:38.210
<v Speaker 4>felt it for like three months,</v>

1470
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:38.991
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1471
00:41:38.991 --> 00:41:39.620
<v Speaker 4>like it was,</v>

1472
00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:40.550
<v Speaker 4>I'd have these loans from like,</v>

1473
00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:41.210
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

1474
00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:43.880
<v Speaker 4>for a jog or whatever and I'm like my fucking pinky toe.</v>

1475
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:44.900
<v Speaker 4>It's all,</v>

1476
00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:46.040
<v Speaker 4>it's all swollen,</v>

1477
00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:47.680
<v Speaker 4>but it's a great reminder to,</v>

1478
00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:48.290
<v Speaker 4>it's just like,</v>

1479
00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:49.280
<v Speaker 4>that's like the stars.</v>

1480
00:41:49.281 --> 00:41:50.130
<v Speaker 4>I honestly think so.</v>

1481
00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:52.610
<v Speaker 4>When you have that kind of interaction with nature and it's still there and you</v>

1482
00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:52.920
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>

1483
00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:53.211
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

1484
00:41:53.211 --> 00:41:53.601
<v Speaker 4>that hurts,</v>

1485
00:41:53.601 --> 00:41:55.050
<v Speaker 4>but it's because I did this.</v>

1486
00:41:55.051 --> 00:41:58.190
<v Speaker 4>It's because I was in that environment and I need to be exposed to that shit.</v>

1487
00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:04.280
<v Speaker 4>And it was just that one little spot where you can get right through it.</v>

1488
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:05.563
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1489
00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:06.543
<v Speaker 4>it's okay.</v>

1490
00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:10.680
<v Speaker 4>Oh Jesus with a four year old stuff on it.</v>

1491
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:14.150
<v Speaker 4>But the guys at the hotel,</v>

1492
00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:18.620
<v Speaker 4>they knew some shit and they had like some sort of vinegar and they put it on</v>

1493
00:42:18.621 --> 00:42:18.801
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1494
00:42:18.801 --> 00:42:22.320
<v Speaker 4>I put it on it for like 20 minutes and it was pretty good and I worked out that</v>

1495
00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:25.670
<v Speaker 4>night and then it felt better like I felt like if I worked out on it to kind of</v>

1496
00:42:25.671 --> 00:42:26.600
<v Speaker 4>smash it all up,</v>

1497
00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:30.690
<v Speaker 4>whatever's in there and it would slowly make its way out well and they make it</v>

1498
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:32.120
<v Speaker 4>urgent is make it really clear.</v>

1499
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:33.410
<v Speaker 4>They're not like surprise,</v>

1500
00:42:33.411 --> 00:42:34.140
<v Speaker 4>I got you.</v>

1501
00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:34.973
<v Speaker 4>They're</v>

1502
00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:37.403
<v Speaker 4>like</v>

1503
00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:39.943
<v Speaker 4>landmines</v>

1504
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:45.320
<v Speaker 4>maybe don't do that and I was going to pick one up like a fucking idiot.</v>

1505
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:46.310
<v Speaker 4>How would you do that?</v>

1506
00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:47.540
<v Speaker 4>Because I was fascinated.</v>

1507
00:42:47.541 --> 00:42:48.330
<v Speaker 4>I've never been anywhere.</v>

1508
00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:49.163
<v Speaker 4>Tropical</v>

1509
00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:52.860
<v Speaker 4>Rusty Blade and you look around and everybody knows anyone.</v>

1510
00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:53.703
<v Speaker 4>We picked that up.</v>

1511
00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:54.753
<v Speaker 4>My challenge</v>

1512
00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:57.993
<v Speaker 4>was amazing though.</v>

1513
00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:02.650
<v Speaker 4>The Sea Turtles Angels,</v>

1514
00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:03.523
<v Speaker 4>I swear to God,</v>

1515
00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:07.010
<v Speaker 4>they were just right there.</v>

1516
00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:08.950
<v Speaker 4>You just want to drink more of this whiskey.</v>

1517
00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:13.010
<v Speaker 4>I'm a big fan of all those animals.</v>

1518
00:43:13.011 --> 00:43:14.780
<v Speaker 4>We went swimming with dolphins,</v>

1519
00:43:14.781 --> 00:43:15.614
<v Speaker 4>which was amazing.</v>

1520
00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:18.140
<v Speaker 4>I had my four year old with me in the water.</v>

1521
00:43:18.141 --> 00:43:20.470
<v Speaker 4>I was holding onto her and she's snorkeling with me.</v>

1522
00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:25.220
<v Speaker 4>I want to expose her to as much really crazy shit early.</v>

1523
00:43:25.221 --> 00:43:26.690
<v Speaker 4>So it seems normal to her.</v>

1524
00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:27.400
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1525
00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:29.600
<v Speaker 4>like I've already started teaching her martial arts</v>

1526
00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.720
<v Speaker 4>and the six year olds pretty good,</v>

1527
00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:36.140
<v Speaker 4>you know like and like probably take to that stuff really naturally.</v>

1528
00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:37.130
<v Speaker 4>I think it's,</v>

1529
00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:40.640
<v Speaker 4>I think there's certain aspects of certain movements that are just normal and</v>

1530
00:43:40.641 --> 00:43:42.050
<v Speaker 4>natural for people if you teach them how to do it.</v>

1531
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:44.450
<v Speaker 4>But I think there's also like learned experience in DNA.</v>

1532
00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:44.781
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>

1533
00:43:44.781 --> 00:43:48.290
<v Speaker 4>the point is like she wasn't scared of going in the ocean and being with the</v>

1534
00:43:48.291 --> 00:43:48.741
<v Speaker 4>dolphins,</v>

1535
00:43:48.741 --> 00:43:49.990
<v Speaker 4>cause she didn't know any better for,</v>

1536
00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:50.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1537
00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:52.680
<v Speaker 4>if I waited until she was nine and I said it's,</v>

1538
00:43:52.681 --> 00:43:55.010
<v Speaker 4>she might go one on one if there's a shark,</v>

1539
00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:56.150
<v Speaker 4>but she's four.</v>

1540
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1541
00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:57.081
<v Speaker 4>it'll be fine.</v>

1542
00:43:57.081 --> 00:43:57.351
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>

1543
00:43:57.351 --> 00:43:58.184
<v Speaker 4>okay</v>

1544
00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:00.320
<v Speaker 4>women around.</v>

1545
00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:01.380
<v Speaker 4>I was on Qy,</v>

1546
00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:03.830
<v Speaker 4>I've been to Hawaii twice the time that we were talking about.</v>

1547
00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:09.160
<v Speaker 4>And this one other times I'm quiet and I saw a family and we were on a dock and</v>

1548
00:44:09.621 --> 00:44:12.260
<v Speaker 4>the dock was probably 10 feet off the water.</v>

1549
00:44:12.261 --> 00:44:12.740
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1550
00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:16.220
<v Speaker 4>And there's a bunch of family members in the water and then a dude dangling a</v>

1551
00:44:16.221 --> 00:44:19.550
<v Speaker 4>little kid off the side and it gets like an Aflac and then they just drop it</v>

1552
00:44:19.551 --> 00:44:20.720
<v Speaker 4>sploosh Oh my God.</v>

1553
00:44:20.721 --> 00:44:21.950
<v Speaker 4>And then they save it and it's fine.</v>

1554
00:44:21.951 --> 00:44:23.090
<v Speaker 4>But that's the,</v>

1555
00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.110
<v Speaker 4>that's how they get used to it.</v>

1556
00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:25.240
<v Speaker 4>They just,</v>

1557
00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:26.073
<v Speaker 4>I don't know</v>

1558
00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:27.710
<v Speaker 4>either.</v>

1559
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:28.760
<v Speaker 4>You're traumatized.</v>

1560
00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.020
<v Speaker 4>You're Michael Phelps.</v>

1561
00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:32.030
<v Speaker 4>That's how that works.</v>

1562
00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:35.400
<v Speaker 1>And then how Michael Phelps learned to swim.</v>

1563
00:44:35.401 --> 00:44:38.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't think what you asked me like I know that well cause you just referenced</v>

1564
00:44:38.851 --> 00:44:39.550
<v Speaker 1>him then,</v>

1565
00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:40.110
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1566
00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:45.110
<v Speaker 1>But the point is that I have back up your claims are that create a model while I</v>

1567
00:44:46.291 --> 00:44:48.360
<v Speaker 1>was taking a little poetic license and</v>

1568
00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:54.020
<v Speaker 1>give that man is weed back,</v>

1569
00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.370
<v Speaker 1>giving him his weed back.</v>

1570
00:44:56.371 --> 00:44:57.780
<v Speaker 1>He tested him for weed all the time.</v>

1571
00:44:57.781 --> 00:44:58.614
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>

1572
00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:02.440
<v Speaker 1>We got plenty more with that.</v>

1573
00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:06.510
<v Speaker 1>Just to defend my Michael pelleve statement one more time.</v>

1574
00:45:06.511 --> 00:45:07.750
<v Speaker 1>We were talking earlier Charlotte,</v>

1575
00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:09.570
<v Speaker 1>my shitty stories create,</v>

1576
00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:10.443
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

1577
00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:15.060
<v Speaker 1>Ben is slow with the cheers.</v>

1578
00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:16.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm really sorry for serving you guys.</v>

1579
00:45:16.681 --> 00:45:17.550
<v Speaker 1>Your drink so slow.</v>

1580
00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:20.913
<v Speaker 1>Turns it around.</v>

1581
00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:24.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm supposed to drive a bucket of whiskey.</v>

1582
00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:26.480
<v Speaker 1>We have a newer service.</v>

1583
00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:28.530
<v Speaker 1>We have a car service called blue bear.</v>

1584
00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:28.891
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1585
00:45:28.891 --> 00:45:29.041
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1586
00:45:29.041 --> 00:45:30.470
<v Speaker 1>We have a real car service on.</v>

1587
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:34.920
<v Speaker 1>And do you hear about the Uber driver who hit the guy in the face with a hammer?</v>

1588
00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:37.680
<v Speaker 1>He hit the guy in the back seat.</v>

1589
00:45:37.681 --> 00:45:38.760
<v Speaker 1>The passenger with a hammer.</v>

1590
00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.200
<v Speaker 1>I have done in the front seat.</v>

1591
00:45:40.201 --> 00:45:40.531
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1592
00:45:40.531 --> 00:45:42.440
<v Speaker 1>but the passenger like there's,</v>

1593
00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:44.760
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure these stories are going to just keep coming out,</v>

1594
00:45:44.761 --> 00:45:47.220
<v Speaker 1>but first kind of Uber Freak out that I had heard of.</v>

1595
00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:48.600
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 1>this shit is unregulated in a seat was like really bad.</v>

1597
00:45:52.410 --> 00:45:53.243
<v Speaker 1>He could have been a dick.</v>

1598
00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:53.620
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

1599
00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:54.453
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

1600
00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:56.071
<v Speaker 1>am I crazy?</v>

1601
00:45:56.071 --> 00:45:56.904
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm talking about?</v>

1602
00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:58.020
<v Speaker 1>The guy was trying to bite his dick.</v>

1603
00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:00.930
<v Speaker 1>Uber Hammer attack may clarify firms responsibilities.</v>

1604
00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:02.153
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1605
00:46:02.490 --> 00:46:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

1606
00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:05.460
<v Speaker 1>Well they've definitely been is that the guy got hit with the hammer.</v>

1607
00:46:05.461 --> 00:46:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1608
00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:08.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1609
00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:08.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1610
00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:09.510
<v Speaker 1>for getting hit with a hammer,</v>

1611
00:46:09.511 --> 00:46:10.450
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have to bash.</v>

1612
00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:16.290
<v Speaker 1>I felt they've been expanding at a pretty miraculous rate.</v>

1613
00:46:16.291 --> 00:46:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Like Uber and Lyft are just growing and grow.</v>

1614
00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:19.913
<v Speaker 1>More and more.</v>

1615
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:24.390
<v Speaker 1>If you're getting higher volume of of employees coming in,</v>

1616
00:46:24.391 --> 00:46:27.060
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get crazy in there every now and again.</v>

1617
00:46:27.061 --> 00:46:27.811
<v Speaker 1>Right it good point.</v>

1618
00:46:27.811 --> 00:46:28.770
<v Speaker 1>Rational Suzanne,</v>

1619
00:46:28.771 --> 00:46:29.610
<v Speaker 1>proper rational.</v>

1620
00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.110
<v Speaker 1>What can we do about peace in the Middle East?</v>

1621
00:46:34.111 --> 00:46:35.800
<v Speaker 1>Suzanne net pass,</v>

1622
00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:39.023
<v Speaker 1>smart move.</v>

1623
00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:43.830
<v Speaker 1>You fucking person on earth you'd say,</v>

1624
00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:46.700
<v Speaker 1>oh I don't,</v>

1625
00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:50.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel equipped or comfortable to get into that conversation but I did</v>

1626
00:46:50.341 --> 00:46:51.174
<v Speaker 1>tell you,</v>

1627
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:55.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm reading a lot of Chomsky lately and it's such an argumentative subject.</v>

1628
00:46:56.340 --> 00:47:01.340
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather just talk about rebuilding can wilderness good calls,</v>

1629
00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:05.940
<v Speaker 1>but also I feel like fucking Pansy at the same time.</v>

1630
00:47:05.941 --> 00:47:07.080
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about this this morning,</v>

1631
00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:09.240
<v Speaker 1>like what do you stand for?</v>

1632
00:47:09.241 --> 00:47:12.010
<v Speaker 1>Like do you sit on the sidelines and let it,</v>

1633
00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:16.950
<v Speaker 1>like you have your relationship with it and you let it sort of transpire the way</v>

1634
00:47:16.951 --> 00:47:18.390
<v Speaker 1>it's going to or,</v>

1635
00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:20.040
<v Speaker 1>but there's already too many players on the field.</v>

1636
00:47:20.041 --> 00:47:20.874
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1637
00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:25.020
<v Speaker 1>There's already over like 15 aside and they don't need more people being like,</v>

1638
00:47:25.021 --> 00:47:25.854
<v Speaker 1>ehh,</v>

1639
00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 1>but without like two to Norfolk and Hornier Ben,</v>

1640
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:33.130
<v Speaker 5>we have a platform that is continuing to grow.</v>

1641
00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:35.080
<v Speaker 5>And I'm not saying that that's our,</v>

1642
00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:37.840
<v Speaker 5>that's not what we're here for.</v>

1643
00:47:37.841 --> 00:47:38.130
<v Speaker 5>Like we're,</v>

1644
00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:42.520
<v Speaker 5>we're here to play music anywhere platform and spread love and you know,</v>

1645
00:47:42.521 --> 00:47:43.354
<v Speaker 5>be,</v>

1646
00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:43.691
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1647
00:47:43.691 --> 00:47:44.291
<v Speaker 5>what we are.</v>

1648
00:47:44.291 --> 00:47:46.540
<v Speaker 5>But at the same time we also have,</v>

1649
00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:47.170
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1650
00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:48.310
<v Speaker 5>an opportunity to,</v>

1651
00:47:48.311 --> 00:47:52.030
<v Speaker 5>if there's something really important that we believe in to talk about it.</v>

1652
00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:54.670
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm not saying I want to talk about peace in the Middle East because I,</v>

1653
00:47:54.671 --> 00:47:55.001
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

1654
00:47:55.001 --> 00:47:56.800
<v Speaker 5>I don't feel qualified for that,</v>

1655
00:47:57.130 --> 00:47:58.520
<v Speaker 5>but I had this car,</v>

1656
00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:00.130
<v Speaker 5>like how this reckoning this morning,</v>

1657
00:48:00.131 --> 00:48:00.491
<v Speaker 5>or I was like,</v>

1658
00:48:00.491 --> 00:48:01.920
<v Speaker 5>what are you going to do Suzanne?</v>

1659
00:48:01.921 --> 00:48:02.500
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1660
00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:06.070
<v Speaker 5>how are you going to handle this kind of energy if,</v>

1661
00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:08.800
<v Speaker 5>if that's the right thing to do.</v>

1662
00:48:08.801 --> 00:48:09.330
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1663
00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:09.431
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

1664
00:48:09.431 --> 00:48:09.521
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

1665
00:48:09.521 --> 00:48:09.710
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1666
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:10.700
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm kind of babbling.</v>

1667
00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:11.031
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1668
00:48:11.031 --> 00:48:11.181
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1669
00:48:11.181 --> 00:48:11.331
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1670
00:48:11.331 --> 00:48:12.164
<v Speaker 2>you're not.</v>

1671
00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:13.170
<v Speaker 2>It's that,</v>

1672
00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:18.170
<v Speaker 2>that anx of not really being able to fix some of the primary concerns of doing</v>

1673
00:48:18.321 --> 00:48:19.154
<v Speaker 2>our part.</v>

1674
00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:21.050
<v Speaker 2>I think you just said the perfect answer,</v>

1675
00:48:21.051 --> 00:48:22.010
<v Speaker 2>which is we don't know.</v>

1676
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.381
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1677
00:48:22.381 --> 00:48:23.214
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

1678
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:27.350
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't help the situation to just introduce energy into it to be like,</v>

1679
00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:27.711
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

1680
00:48:27.711 --> 00:48:28.401
<v Speaker 2>that's fucked up.</v>

1681
00:48:28.401 --> 00:48:28.641
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1682
00:48:28.641 --> 00:48:28.821
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1683
00:48:28.821 --> 00:48:29.960
<v Speaker 2>we all know it's fucked up.</v>

1684
00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:32.750
<v Speaker 2>I think there's people that are compelled to fix the system.</v>

1685
00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:35.780
<v Speaker 2>There's people that are compelled to point out the flaws in the system.</v>

1686
00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:38.570
<v Speaker 2>There's people that are compelled to inspire others.</v>

1687
00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:40.010
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's where you guys are.</v>

1688
00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:43.370
<v Speaker 2>He might inspire others with your words or your music or your,</v>

1689
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.851
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1690
00:48:43.851 --> 00:48:46.370
<v Speaker 2>your combination of your talent and your points of view.</v>

1691
00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:47.181
<v Speaker 2>My influence,</v>

1692
00:48:47.181 --> 00:48:48.020
<v Speaker 2>people's ideas.</v>

1693
00:48:48.021 --> 00:48:51.290
<v Speaker 2>And then in turn that sets like,</v>

1694
00:48:51.291 --> 00:48:55.880
<v Speaker 2>I think whenever like someone like me who makes a lot of sense or someone who</v>

1695
00:48:55.881 --> 00:49:00.230
<v Speaker 2>speaks in a way that makes you realign your perceptions of the world,</v>

1696
00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:03.800
<v Speaker 2>when they communicate with folks and they put something in their head,</v>

1697
00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:08.390
<v Speaker 2>those people may spread those ideas out and add to them and,</v>

1698
00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:08.810
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1699
00:49:08.810 --> 00:49:09.170
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1700
00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:10.490
<v Speaker 2>and it goes further and further and further.</v>

1701
00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:14.870
<v Speaker 2>And then eventually all of that influences the culture in a more positive way</v>

1702
00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:18.860
<v Speaker 2>than most protests or most,</v>

1703
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:23.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's very few like really like angry violent reactions.</v>

1704
00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:28.910
<v Speaker 2>What they do is they cause people to become defensive.</v>

1705
00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:31.490
<v Speaker 2>They cause people to reexamine the situation.</v>

1706
00:49:31.491 --> 00:49:34.070
<v Speaker 2>But what causes people to really change themselves?</v>

1707
00:49:34.071 --> 00:49:35.540
<v Speaker 2>It's almost always inspiration.</v>

1708
00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:37.510
<v Speaker 2>It's almost always wanting to be inspired.</v>

1709
00:49:37.511 --> 00:49:38.900
<v Speaker 2>Like if you see someone that like,</v>

1710
00:49:38.901 --> 00:49:43.100
<v Speaker 2>have you ever gone to see like someone performed live and you just go fuck and</v>

1711
00:49:43.101 --> 00:49:45.470
<v Speaker 2>you just want to go home and play and you just want to go home and practice,</v>

1712
00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:45.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1713
00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:46.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1714
00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:47.690
<v Speaker 2>Like that fuel.</v>

1715
00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:48.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1716
00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:50.120
<v Speaker 2>Like sometimes you'll go see a movie and it just,</v>

1717
00:49:50.121 --> 00:49:51.110
<v Speaker 2>it's so good.</v>

1718
00:49:51.111 --> 00:49:52.370
<v Speaker 2>You just want to go to the gym.</v>

1719
00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:53.533
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1720
00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:56.600
<v Speaker 2>Like sometimes these things happen,</v>

1721
00:49:56.620 --> 00:49:57.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1722
00:49:57.140 --> 00:50:00.680
<v Speaker 2>talking about like sometimes you're in your car and fucking song comes on.</v>

1723
00:50:00.681 --> 00:50:02.330
<v Speaker 2>It just changes your state.</v>

1724
00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:03.111
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1725
00:50:03.111 --> 00:50:03.471
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>

1726

1743
00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:28.220
<v Speaker 2>everybody doesn't need to try to fix the world.</v>

1744
00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:29.570
<v Speaker 3>Everybody can't fix the world.</v>

1745
00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:31.490
<v Speaker 3>Is this on the drive over here?</v>

1746
00:50:31.491 --> 00:50:32.320
<v Speaker 3>A little bit.</v>

1747
00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:33.153
<v Speaker 3>So anyone,</v>

1748
00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:34.490
<v Speaker 3>it's not about fixing the world,</v>

1749
00:50:34.491 --> 00:50:36.800
<v Speaker 3>it's just about making sure that I'm,</v>

1750
00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:37.873
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1751
00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:39.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't to say doing what I'm supposed to do,</v>

1752
00:50:39.711 --> 00:50:40.680
<v Speaker 3>but like not,</v>

1753
00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:41.300
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

1754
00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:44.390
<v Speaker 3>not a sitting out when I should,</v>

1755
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:45.060
<v Speaker 3>should be.</v>

1756
00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:45.950
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't be.</v>

1757
00:50:45.951 --> 00:50:46.280
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1758
00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:47.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of like,</v>

1759
00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:51.470
<v Speaker 3>but I think the point of what he's saying is by following through on something,</v>

1760
00:50:51.471 --> 00:50:52.670
<v Speaker 3>you're passionate about it,</v>

1761
00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:53.421
<v Speaker 3>you are,</v>

1762
00:50:53.421 --> 00:50:57.200
<v Speaker 3>that that is the best thing you can do because it creates those environments for</v>

1763
00:50:57.201 --> 00:50:58.034
<v Speaker 3>other people.</v>

1764
00:50:58.050 --> 00:50:58.640
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1765
00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:03.640
<v Speaker 3>and having opinions like expressing yourself once you've like,</v>

1766
00:51:04.090 --> 00:51:04.280
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1767
00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:04.381
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1768
00:51:04.381 --> 00:51:05.061
<v Speaker 3>you guys are doing,</v>

1769
00:51:05.061 --> 00:51:06.650
<v Speaker 3>you're establishing your music,</v>

1770
00:51:06.651 --> 00:51:07.610
<v Speaker 3>establishing your art,</v>

1771
00:51:07.611 --> 00:51:10.250
<v Speaker 3>and then you have opinions and then people go,</v>

1772
00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:10.671
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

1773
00:51:10.671 --> 00:51:12.650
<v Speaker 3>this guy seems so cool and they make sense.</v>

1774
00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:13.603
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make sense.</v>

1775
00:51:14.110 --> 00:51:14.350
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1776
00:51:14.350 --> 00:51:15.183
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

1777
00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:16.490
<v Speaker 3>I would</v>

1778
00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:21.590
<v Speaker 3>be becoming more and more comfortable with opinions changing in my own opinion</v>

1779
00:51:21.591 --> 00:51:22.880
<v Speaker 3>is changing because I think I,</v>

1780
00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:23.781
<v Speaker 3>I've actually been,</v>

1781
00:51:23.781 --> 00:51:25.580
<v Speaker 3>which I didn't understand it as this,</v>

1782
00:51:25.581 --> 00:51:27.230
<v Speaker 3>but it's a conservative mindset to be like,</v>

1783
00:51:27.231 --> 00:51:27.351
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1784
00:51:27.351 --> 00:51:28.161
<v Speaker 3>this is my opinion.</v>

1785
00:51:28.161 --> 00:51:28.971
<v Speaker 3>I'm sticking to it.</v>

1786
00:51:28.971 --> 00:51:29.450
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1787

<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

1790
00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:33.830
<v Speaker 3>the is the reason I'm bringing it up,</v>

1791
00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:35.720
<v Speaker 3>it's fascinating because I'm reading this,</v>

1792
00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:39.200
<v Speaker 3>all these interviews with him throughout his career and I just got to 1980</v>

<v Speaker 3>like [inaudible]</v>

1797
00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:48.500
<v Speaker 3>and 1980 he's a born again Christian,</v>

1798
00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:50.890
<v Speaker 3>like legitimately Christ,</v>

1799
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:53.120
<v Speaker 3>the crisis of the way and the light.</v>

1800
00:51:53.121 --> 00:51:57.200
<v Speaker 3>This is what I believe in was a born again Christian hundred and 10% honestly.</v>

1801
00:51:57.430 --> 00:52:01.100
<v Speaker 3>And it's amazing to see this dude who so comfortable and just like inhabiting</v>

1802
00:52:01.101 --> 00:52:02.960
<v Speaker 3>what he is experiencing at that time.</v>

1816
00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:25.670
<v Speaker 3>But to hear him talk about this,</v>

<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

1872

<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

1873
00:53:48.151 --> 00:53:48.481

<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1876
00:53:50.041 --> 00:53:51.870
<v Speaker 8>and you kind of got outed for and look,</v>

1877
00:53:51.871 --> 00:53:52.051
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

1878
00:53:52.051 --> 00:53:52.591
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

1879
00:53:52.591 --> 00:53:53.700
<v Speaker 8>I'm not an expert on it,</v>

1880
00:53:53.701 --> 00:53:55.160
<v Speaker 8>so I hope this doesn't bite.</v>

1881
00:53:55.410 --> 00:53:55.780
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

1882
00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:56.700
<v Speaker 8>I hope you're right.</v>

1883
00:53:57.150 --> 00:53:57.841
<v Speaker 8>I hope you're right.</v>

1884
00:53:57.841 --> 00:53:59.820
<v Speaker 8>I definitely don't want him to be a child molester.</v>

00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:02.370
<v Speaker 8>Healthy viewpoint.</v>

<v Speaker 8>I try to look towards the positive at all.</v>

1888
00:54:07.690 --> 00:54:08.523
<v Speaker 8>It was,</v>

1889
00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:10.770
<v Speaker 8>but he's an odd guy like he does.</v>

1890
00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:15.890
<v Speaker 8>He admit while he made a statement about homosexuality or about being a woman</v>

1891
00:54:16.501 --> 00:54:19.700
<v Speaker 8>about how he had been a woman in his life and it was,</v>

1892
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:21.830
<v Speaker 8>it was very strange because it was like there's</v>

1893
00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:28.400
<v Speaker 8>no in a sexual sense like he had been the receiving and of male sex,</v>

00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:33.813
<v Speaker 8>catcher.</v>

1897

1922
00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:18.653
<v Speaker 8>Did he talk to me?</v>

1923
00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:23.040
<v Speaker 8>That's under boys when he had his first period,</v>

1924
00:55:23.070 --> 00:55:25.800
<v Speaker 8>or I don't know if you call it a period when it's a man's,</v>

1925
00:55:25.801 --> 00:55:27.560
<v Speaker 8>but it's not like an egg got dropped.</v>

<v Speaker 8>you're not right.</v>

1929
00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:33.113
<v Speaker 8>You're not.</v>

1930
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:35.500
<v Speaker 8>Do you accept a woman who's like,</v>

1931
00:55:35.790 --> 00:55:36.930
<v Speaker 8>like a transgender woman?</v>

1932
00:55:36.931 --> 00:55:38.790
<v Speaker 8>Do you accept that as a pure woman?</v>

1933
00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:40.103
<v Speaker 8>Absolutely.</v>

1938
00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:48.001
<v Speaker 8>You're freaking out.</v>

1939
00:55:48.001 --> 00:55:48.960
<v Speaker 8>Maybe I'm having my period,</v>

1940
00:55:54.450 --> 00:55:56.740
<v Speaker 8>but you stop bitching about your fucking period.</v>

1941
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:03.250
<v Speaker 8>Some transgender woman out there bitching about her appearance.</v>

1942
00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:09.410
<v Speaker 8>Transgender friends out there listening.</v>

1943
00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:11.153
<v Speaker 8>I'll fucking,</v>

1944
00:56:11.610 --> 00:56:12.443
<v Speaker 8>I'll bet you.</v>

1945
00:56:12.690 --> 00:56:12.850
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

1946
00:56:12.850 --> 00:56:13.531
<v Speaker 8>first of all,</v>

1947
00:56:13.531 --> 00:56:13.830
<v Speaker 8>let's,</v>

1948
00:56:13.830 --> 00:56:14.663
<v Speaker 8>let's backtrack.</v>

1949
00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:15.870
<v Speaker 8>So you had buck angel?</v>

1950
00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:16.920
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>

1951
00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:17.620
<v Speaker 8>Buck Angel,</v>

1952
00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:18.453
<v Speaker 8>your,</v>

1953
00:56:18.970 --> 00:56:19.711
<v Speaker 8>we talked about it.</v>

1954
00:56:19.711 --> 00:56:20.740
<v Speaker 8>We talked about,</v>

1955
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:22.770
<v Speaker 8>I always wanted to have him on the show.</v>

1956
00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:23.461
<v Speaker 8>He's cool.</v>

1957
00:56:23.461 --> 00:56:24.310
<v Speaker 8>It's fascinating.</v>

1958
00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:24.670
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

1959
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:26.080
<v Speaker 2>He's a really nice guy.</v>

1960
00:56:26.081 --> 00:56:28.240
<v Speaker 2>He's a really nice guy and it's,</v>

1961
00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:28.811
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1962
00:56:28.811 --> 00:56:32.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm very flexible with my ideas about like gender.</v>

1963
00:56:32.081 --> 00:56:32.914
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1964
00:56:33.070 --> 00:56:36.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't begrudge anybody their own sexual proclivities,</v>

1965
00:56:36.971 --> 00:56:41.971
<v Speaker 2>their own ideas about gender conformity and about gender identity.</v>

1966
00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:47.680
<v Speaker 2>I have been in this battle with a lot of transgender people over the last year</v>

1967
00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:47.681
<v Speaker 2>or so,</v>

1968
00:56:47.681 --> 00:56:52.240
<v Speaker 2>but it's purely because of one individual who is purely because of a woman who</v>

1969
00:56:52.241 --> 00:56:53.170
<v Speaker 2>used to be a man.</v>

1970
00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:56.890
<v Speaker 2>She was a man for 30 years and started MMA fighting against women.</v>

1971
00:56:57.250 --> 00:56:58.083
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1972
00:56:58.120 --> 00:56:58.953
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1973
00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:00.070
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1974
00:57:00.070 --> 00:57:00.640
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1975
00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:01.330
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1976
00:57:01.330 --> 00:57:02.170
<v Speaker 1>set a bunch of rude,</v>

1977
00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:02.590
<v Speaker 1>mean,</v>

1978
00:57:02.590 --> 00:57:06.370
<v Speaker 1>mean shit that some things that we don't know that you know that I know.</v>

1979
00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:07.263
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1980
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:10.481
<v Speaker 2>Bunch of rude,</v>

1981
00:57:10.481 --> 00:57:11.314
<v Speaker 2>mean shit.</v>

1982
00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:15.370
<v Speaker 2>You know that if I like thought about the possibility that would make other</v>

1983
00:57:15.371 --> 00:57:16.780
<v Speaker 2>transgender people feel bad,</v>

1984
00:57:16.781 --> 00:57:17.890
<v Speaker 2>I probably wouldn't have said again.</v>

1985
00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:22.510
<v Speaker 2>But the reality is that it's ridic it's one thing to say that you're a woman,</v>

1986
00:57:22.511 --> 00:57:26.440
<v Speaker 2>but it's another thing to say that there's not some crazy mechanical advantages</v>

1987
00:57:26.441 --> 00:57:29.950
<v Speaker 2>to the male frame that you don't lose when you transitioned to being a woman.</v>

1988
00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:30.671
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

1989
00:57:30.671 --> 00:57:31.570
<v Speaker 2>there's a one,</v>

1990
00:57:31.650 --> 00:57:34.750
<v Speaker 2>there's a 10% increase in reaction to like,</v>

1991
00:57:34.751 --> 00:57:37.840
<v Speaker 2>men have a quicker reaction time by 10% across the board.</v>

1992
00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:40.180
<v Speaker 2>But in some states it's,</v>

1993
00:57:40.550 --> 00:57:40.871
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

1994
00:57:40.871 --> 00:57:41.560
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing.</v>

1995
00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:46.560
<v Speaker 2>Why do we even have a problem with a man like having a fight with a woman?</v>

1996
00:57:46.841 --> 00:57:48.190
<v Speaker 2>Like an actual man having a fight.</v>

1997
00:57:48.191 --> 00:57:48.491
<v Speaker 2>We want to,</v>

1998
00:57:48.491 --> 00:57:49.990
<v Speaker 2>if they both agree on it,</v>

1999
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:53.350
<v Speaker 2>if the woman knows she's fighting a man and the man knows he's fighting a woman</v>

2000
00:57:53.351 --> 00:57:54.184
<v Speaker 2>and they both agree.</v>

2001
00:57:54.250 --> 00:57:55.990
<v Speaker 2>If you could fucking ride bulls.</v>

2002
00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:56.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2003
00:57:56.290 --> 00:57:56.681
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2004
00:57:56.681 --> 00:57:57.514
<v Speaker 2>Watch he came.</v>

2005
00:57:57.580 --> 00:57:58.300
<v Speaker 2>Which you can.</v>

2006
00:57:58.300 --> 00:57:59.560
<v Speaker 2>Why can't you fight?</v>

2007
00:57:59.590 --> 00:58:02.040
<v Speaker 2>Why can't a woman decides she wants to beat the shit out of a man?</v>

2008
00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:02.770
<v Speaker 2>See if she could do it.</v>

2009
00:58:02.770 --> 00:58:03.760
<v Speaker 2>If they both weigh the same,</v>

2010
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:04.870
<v Speaker 2>no reason why not.</v>

2011
00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:05.710
<v Speaker 2>Hey Joe.</v>

2012
00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:06.250
<v Speaker 2>Hey Man.</v>

2013

00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:08.673
<v Speaker 2>How's it record?</v>

2017
00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:09.521
<v Speaker 2>How's it record?</v>

2018
00:58:09.521 --> 00:58:10.090
<v Speaker 2>Record does,</v>

2019
00:58:10.090 --> 00:58:11.020
<v Speaker 2>did she win a lot?</v>

2020
00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:12.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>

2021
00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:13.733
<v Speaker 2>Every time.</v>

2022
00:58:14.350 --> 00:58:16.630
<v Speaker 2>It's not just a win win and like really quick,</v>

2023
00:58:16.631 --> 00:58:17.440
<v Speaker 2>violent way.</v>

2024
00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:18.010
<v Speaker 2>That's horrible.</v>

2025
00:58:18.010 --> 00:58:18.400
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2026
00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:18.761
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2027
00:58:18.761 --> 00:58:19.780
<v Speaker 2>Well she lost once though.</v>

2028
00:58:19.781 --> 00:58:20.111
<v Speaker 2>She lost,</v>

2029
00:58:20.111 --> 00:58:21.550
<v Speaker 2>wants to some bad ass bitch.</v>

2030
00:58:22.210 --> 00:58:23.080
<v Speaker 2>She lost once.</v>

2031
00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:23.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2032
00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:25.650
<v Speaker 2>but it was just like I,</v>

2033
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:26.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2034
00:58:26.410 --> 00:58:27.280
<v Speaker 2>all due respect,</v>

2035
00:58:27.330 --> 00:58:28.300
<v Speaker 2>not trying to be mean.</v>

2036
00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:30.910
<v Speaker 2>Her skill level is very rudimentary.</v>

2037
00:58:31.090 --> 00:58:34.240
<v Speaker 2>I watched her movements and there's nothing substantial about it.</v>

2038
00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:36.770
<v Speaker 2>There's like there's some MMA fighters.</v>

2039
00:58:37.730 --> 00:58:37.990
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

2040
00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:38.823
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>

2041
00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:40.660
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely technique involved.</v>

2042
00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:42.310
<v Speaker 2>She definitely knows a lot of techniques.</v>

2043
00:58:42.311 --> 00:58:43.330
<v Speaker 2>She's definitely trains hard.</v>

2044
00:58:43.450 --> 00:58:46.730
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt about it cause she's fighting five minute rounds or a w I don't</v>

2045
00:58:46.731 --> 00:58:49.190
<v Speaker 2>know if they fight five minute rounds in a lot of these female organization.</v>

2046
00:58:49.191 --> 00:58:51.520
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they lower the number of minutes,</v>

2047
00:58:51.790 --> 00:58:53.500
<v Speaker 2>but she's definitely talented.</v>

2048
00:58:53.501 --> 00:58:54.520
<v Speaker 2>She definitely can fight.</v>

2049
00:58:54.550 --> 00:58:55.570
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt about it.</v>

2050
00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:56.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2051
00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:59.960
<v Speaker 2>it's not like she's some horrible amateur that has no idea what she's doing</v>

2052
00:58:59.961 --> 00:59:01.240
<v Speaker 2>because she's knocking people out.</v>

2053
00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:01.990
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2054
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:03.430
<v Speaker 2>whether or not she's knocking,</v>

2055
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.800
<v Speaker 2>you know what they would call sis gender.</v>

2056
00:59:05.801 --> 00:59:08.230
<v Speaker 2>That's what they like to call transgender people like to call people that were</v>

2057
00:59:08.231 --> 00:59:10.420
<v Speaker 2>born a certain gender called CIS gender.</v>

2058
00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:10.781
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>

2059
00:59:10.781 --> 00:59:11.510
<v Speaker 2>I know it stands for,</v>

2060
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:12.040
<v Speaker 2>no one knows.</v>

2061
00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:13.060
<v Speaker 2>No one knows it just,</v>

2062
00:59:13.061 --> 00:59:13.894
<v Speaker 2>it's popcorn.</v>

2063
00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:14.830
<v Speaker 2>Why do you call it popcorn?</v>

2064
00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:15.520
<v Speaker 2>You just do.</v>

2065
00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:16.030
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2066
00:59:16.030 --> 00:59:16.863
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2067
00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:19.693
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

2068
00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:22.430
<v Speaker 1>Lake Goulay Koolaid.</v>

2069
00:59:22.530 --> 00:59:23.120
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno,</v>

2070
00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:24.410
<v Speaker 2>I cause it's day</v>

2071
00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:26.660
<v Speaker 5>cool.</v>

2072
00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:27.381
<v Speaker 5>Give you diabetes.</v>

2073
00:59:27.381 --> 00:59:28.214
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>

2074
00:59:28.450 --> 00:59:29.283
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2075
00:59:30.110 --> 00:59:30.270
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

2076
00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:32.650
<v Speaker 2>but for the first few fights,</v>

2077
00:59:32.651 --> 00:59:34.690
<v Speaker 2>she did admit that she used to be a man.</v>

2078
00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:35.171
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

2079
00:59:35.171 --> 00:59:36.004
<v Speaker 2>that's fire.</v>

2080
00:59:36.070 --> 00:59:37.340
<v Speaker 2>And she said that they did it.</v>

2081
00:59:37.341 --> 00:59:41.020
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't something that they required of her and she thought it was a mental or</v>

2082
00:59:41.021 --> 00:59:41.530
<v Speaker 2>medical.</v>

2083
00:59:41.530 --> 00:59:42.280
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2084
00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:42.610
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2085
00:59:42.610 --> 00:59:43.420
<v Speaker 2>Or I dunno.</v>

2086
00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:43.810
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

2087
00:59:43.810 --> 00:59:44.290
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't,</v>

2088
00:59:44.290 --> 00:59:45.040
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't say,</v>

2089
00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:46.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly how it came out,</v>

2090
00:59:46.810 --> 00:59:48.850
<v Speaker 2>but the people that have fought or that didn't know that she used to be,</v>

2091
00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:49.061
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2092
00:59:49.061 --> 00:59:50.050
<v Speaker 2>we're pretty fucking upset.</v>

2093
00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:51.510
<v Speaker 2>Honestly.</v>

2094
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:52.650
<v Speaker 5>This is so interesting.</v>

2095
00:59:52.651 --> 00:59:54.810
<v Speaker 5>Like this is fascinating that at this day and age,</v>

2096
00:59:54.811 --> 00:59:57.030
<v Speaker 5>this is an argument that we have is like,</v>

2097
00:59:57.390 --> 00:59:57.900
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2098
00:59:57.900 --> 00:59:58.680
<v Speaker 5>you have to,</v>

2099
00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:01.140
<v Speaker 5>you have to label something and then it's like,</v>

2100
01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:02.680
<v Speaker 5>well is it this or is it that and it,</v>

2101
01:00:02.681 --> 01:00:03.810
<v Speaker 5>and it's both things.</v>

2102
01:00:03.811 --> 01:00:04.081
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2103
01:00:04.081 --> 01:00:04.740
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

2104
01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:05.220
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2105
01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:06.150
<v Speaker 5>if like,</v>

2106
01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:11.180
<v Speaker 5>is is buck angel a law like the butchest of lesbians or is Buck Angel a man?</v>

2107
01:00:12.990 --> 01:00:13.231
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2108
01:00:13.231 --> 01:00:13.651
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

2109
01:00:13.651 --> 01:00:15.030
<v Speaker 5>Like first of all,</v>

2110
01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:17.850
<v Speaker 5>I respect buck and I think that he's great.</v>

2111
01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:18.991
<v Speaker 5>We met him,</v>

2112
01:00:18.991 --> 01:00:19.620
<v Speaker 5>he's great.</v>

2113
01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:20.670
<v Speaker 5>But like at the same time,</v>

2114
01:00:20.671 --> 01:00:23.490
<v Speaker 5>I'm kind of like just kind of fascinated by the,</v>

2115
01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:25.680
<v Speaker 5>the whole conversation to begin with.</v>

2116
01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:26.663
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2117
01:00:27.450 --> 01:00:27.691
<v Speaker 5>sorry,</v>

2118
01:00:27.691 --> 01:00:28.200
<v Speaker 5>go ahead.</v>

2119
01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:29.060
<v Speaker 5>I was just going to say I,</v>

2120
01:00:29.061 --> 01:00:29.330
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2121
01:00:29.330 --> 01:00:31.740
<v Speaker 5>I think it doesn't to most rational people,</v>

2122
01:00:31.741 --> 01:00:32.420
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't really make it</v>

2123
01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:33.740
<v Speaker 2>different in a difference.</v>

2124
01:00:33.741 --> 01:00:36.260
<v Speaker 2>It's like self definition where you can call yourself whatever you want.</v>

2125
01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:38.540
<v Speaker 2>I think it's when people start proselytizing about it,</v>

2126
01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:40.940
<v Speaker 2>that's a problem because then,</v>

2127
01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:41.691
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2128
01:00:41.691 --> 01:00:43.220
<v Speaker 2>it's invasive in this issue.</v>

2129
01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:45.920
<v Speaker 2>My only concern is that as a personal safety issue,</v>

2130
01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:46.550
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

2131
01:00:46.550 --> 01:00:47.001
<v Speaker 5>And there's a,</v>

2132
01:00:47.001 --> 01:00:47.870
<v Speaker 5>there's sort of like a,</v>

2133
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.481
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

2134
01:00:48.481 --> 01:00:49.191
<v Speaker 5>I fuck,</v>

2135
01:00:49.191 --> 01:00:50.780
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to get involved in an argument,</v>

2136
01:00:50.781 --> 01:00:51.614
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

2137
01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:53.090
<v Speaker 5>if anyone on the internet,</v>

2138
01:00:53.091 --> 01:00:56.330
<v Speaker 5>but it almost sort of feels like a unfair advantage.</v>

2139
01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:56.571
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2140
01:00:56.571 --> 01:00:56.781
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2141
01:00:56.781 --> 01:00:57.441
<v Speaker 2>it's an unfair,</v>

2142
01:00:57.441 --> 01:00:57.920
<v Speaker 2>but it is,</v>

2143
01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:58.940
<v Speaker 2>it is an unfair advantage.</v>

2144
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.590
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that the woman isn't going to win or the other,</v>

2145
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:03.780
<v Speaker 2>the other woman isn't going to win well and to do it.</v>

2146
01:01:03.790 --> 01:01:05.070
<v Speaker 2>But it does mean it's just that the,</v>

2147
01:01:05.090 --> 01:01:06.340
<v Speaker 2>the physical advances,</v>

2148
01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:10.490
<v Speaker 2>it's often like you can overcome physical advance with technique,</v>

2149
01:01:10.491 --> 01:01:11.330
<v Speaker 2>but you shouldn't have to.</v>

2150
01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:11.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2151
01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:13.280
<v Speaker 2>There's certain amount of physical advance where,</v>

2152
01:01:13.281 --> 01:01:14.114
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2153
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:17.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the studies have really been done on like fighters.</v>

2154
01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:20.240
<v Speaker 2>I think there's been some studies on athletes and athletes reaction,</v>

2155
01:01:20.241 --> 01:01:22.940
<v Speaker 2>but I think the difference between being a man,</v>

2156
01:01:23.130 --> 01:01:23.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2157
01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:27.680
<v Speaker 2>who transitions into being a woman in a competing in Olympic volleyball is very</v>

2158
01:01:27.681 --> 01:01:30.320
<v Speaker 2>different than being a man who used to be a woman.</v>

2159
01:01:30.321 --> 01:01:32.300
<v Speaker 2>You transitioned to combat sports because you're,</v>

2160
01:01:32.301 --> 01:01:32.590
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2161
01:01:32.590 --> 01:01:32.781
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2162
01:01:32.781 --> 01:01:37.100
<v Speaker 2>you're essentially dealing with having an advantage in dealing out concussions.</v>

2163
01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:37.610
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

2164
01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:38.450
<v Speaker 2>that's a fucking,</v>

2165
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:39.710
<v Speaker 2>that's a big deal.</v>

2166
01:01:39.970 --> 01:01:42.020
<v Speaker 2>This is a difference in the way we're shaped,</v>

2167
01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:42.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2168
01:01:42.891 --> 01:01:44.990
<v Speaker 2>and the broader shoulders of the male,</v>

2169
01:01:44.991 --> 01:01:46.180
<v Speaker 2>the larger hands,</v>

2170
01:01:46.181 --> 01:01:46.490
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2171
01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:49.670
<v Speaker 2>the more narrow hips that different geometry of the body.</v>

2172
01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.010
<v Speaker 2>A man curve of the Brown.</v>

2173
01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:52.993
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

2174
01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:02.020
<v Speaker 9>So why do you run in here with</v>

2175
01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:05.480
<v Speaker 9>Laura Role?</v>

2176
01:02:05.610 --> 01:02:06.021
<v Speaker 9>Careful.</v>

2177
01:02:06.021 --> 01:02:06.854

2178
01:02:07.790 --> 01:02:08.890
<v Speaker 9>very fast and furious,</v>

2179
01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:09.733
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>

2180
01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:12.200
<v Speaker 2>Fucking transcend gender togs.</v>

2181
01:02:12.450 --> 01:02:13.210
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

2182
01:02:13.210 --> 01:02:14.043
<v Speaker 9>I had a question.</v>

2183
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:15.280
<v Speaker 9>Have you ever</v>

2184
01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:16.113
<v Speaker 5>I thought a woman.</v>

2185
01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:17.240
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2186
01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:17.600
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2187
01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:19.140
<v Speaker 2>I sparred with them way,</v>

2188
01:02:19.141 --> 01:02:19.351
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

2189
01:02:19.351 --> 01:02:20.280
<v Speaker 2>way back in the day</v>

2190
01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.360
<v Speaker 1>and in taekwondo.</v>

2191
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:24.300
<v Speaker 1>Never in kickboxing but in taekwondo class sometimes you have to spar with them</v>

2192
01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:25.440
<v Speaker 1>but I never heard one.</v>

2193
01:02:25.730 --> 01:02:27.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah I was playing basketball with linen.</v>

2194
01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:29.830
<v Speaker 1>Bet You do.</v>

2195
01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:30.451
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

2196
01:02:30.451 --> 01:02:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Everybody gets sweaty.</v>

2197
01:02:31.501 --> 01:02:32.334
<v Speaker 1>People</v>

2198
01:02:35.050 --> 01:02:38.380
<v Speaker 1>will stay there right here and that's okay</v>

2199
01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:43.840
<v Speaker 1>while playing basketball and given that cause we wouldn't have gotten a seven.</v>

2200
01:02:44.350 --> 01:02:45.640
<v Speaker 1>What did that come on?</v>

2201
01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:48.780
<v Speaker 1>Everybody chills out and everyone just plays the,</v>

2202
01:02:48.781 --> 01:02:52.200
<v Speaker 1>I think it's kind of more on your volleyball team in the sense that people are</v>

2203
01:02:52.201 --> 01:02:53.220
<v Speaker 1>playing the game.</v>

2204
01:02:53.221 --> 01:02:56.580
<v Speaker 1>Then it's not about like I'm gonna fucking elbow this gun type physical.</v>

2205
01:02:56.690 --> 01:03:00.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like people are actually applying the techniques of basketball,</v>

2206
01:03:00.961 --> 01:03:01.794
<v Speaker 1>drama.</v>

2207
01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:07.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like when when dudes low in general like extracurricular and I'm not</v>

2208
01:03:07.291 --> 01:03:12.291
<v Speaker 1>talking about martial arts and like actual training that that you're involved</v>

<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

2210
01:03:12.930 --> 01:03:15.270
<v Speaker 1>My experience with extra curriculars,</v>

2211
01:03:15.271 --> 01:03:18.750
<v Speaker 1>sporting activities are kickball and basketball and saws are huge.</v>

2212
01:03:18.751 --> 01:03:19.380
<v Speaker 1>My world.</v>

2213
01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:24.380
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing because people get so into it and the ones that like get angry and</v>

2214
01:03:25.831 --> 01:03:26.664
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

2216
01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:28.651
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>

2217
01:03:28.651 --> 01:03:31.710
<v Speaker 1>that kind of sometimes also makes it more fun because then there's that guy that</v>

<v Speaker 1>Give a chicken drunk and sloppy kiss.</v>

01:05:11.821 --> 01:05:12.654
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 8>Go ahead and ask anyway.</v>

2272
01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:22.250
<v Speaker 8>Have you ever kissed a man?</v>

2273
01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:23.083
<v Speaker 8>Never.</v>

2274
01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:26.800
<v Speaker 8>Do you want to Bruce?</v>

2275
01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:33.720
<v Speaker 8>I did allow myself to Condo just wondering about this Mick Jagger,</v>

2276
01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:35.163
<v Speaker 8>David Bowie Fan,</v>

2277
01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:36.420
<v Speaker 8>and I was thinking,</v>

2278
01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:37.253
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>

2279
01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:38.253
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>

2280
01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:42.660
<v Speaker 8>maybe am I like really wrapped up tight and connected to this idea,</v>

2281
01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:44.560
<v Speaker 8>not just of heterosexuality,</v>

2282
01:05:44.770 --> 01:05:49.770
<v Speaker 8>but of lifelong heterosexual practice exclusively.</v>

2283
01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:54.730
<v Speaker 8>Like if I so wrapped up in that that I couldn't like give a man a kiss and then</v>

2284
01:05:54.731 --> 01:05:55.151
<v Speaker 8>I was like,</v>

2285
01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:56.590
<v Speaker 8>you better shut the fuck up whole mall.</v>

2286
01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:00.020
<v Speaker 8>I said that to myself.</v>

2287
01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:01.570
<v Speaker 8>You're trying to plant these thoughts in my head.</v>

2288
01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:02.720
<v Speaker 8>You asked yourself,</v>

2289
01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:03.061
<v Speaker 8>yes.</v>

2290
01:06:03.061 --> 01:06:04.990
<v Speaker 8>I gave that up because I was trying to,</v>

2291
01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:05.741
<v Speaker 8>I was wondering,</v>

2292
01:06:05.741 --> 01:06:06.071
<v Speaker 8>I was like,</v>

2293
01:06:06.071 --> 01:06:06.300
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>

2294
01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:07.480
<v Speaker 8>look at these guys.</v>

2295
01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:08.860
<v Speaker 8>Like I always,</v>

2296
01:06:09.010 --> 01:06:12.620
<v Speaker 8>I do little things where I will try to um,</v>

2297
01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:17.410
<v Speaker 8>experience things or go places or put my,</v>

2298
01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:19.570
<v Speaker 8>my mind or my consciousness in a,</v>

2299
01:06:19.571 --> 01:06:24.550
<v Speaker 8>in an unusual situation because I think that when you have unusual experiences,</v>

2300
01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:25.570
<v Speaker 8>whether it's even,</v>

2301
01:06:25.571 --> 01:06:29.380
<v Speaker 8>even if you like watch unusual DVDs or go to a strange place,</v>

2302
01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:31.150
<v Speaker 8>you take in new information,</v>

2303
01:06:31.151 --> 01:06:34.150
<v Speaker 8>that new information interacts with all the other information in your head and</v>

2304
01:06:34.151 --> 01:06:36.040
<v Speaker 8>you form maybe new creative ideas.</v>

2305
01:06:36.070 --> 01:06:36.670
<v Speaker 8>So I think like,</v>

2306
01:06:36.670 --> 01:06:38.050
<v Speaker 8>as a person who tries to be creative,</v>

2307
01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:40.960
<v Speaker 8>it's good to have as many experiences as possible.</v>

2308
01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:43.003
<v Speaker 8>Whoa.</v>

2309
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.320
<v Speaker 8>Certain line that I go,</v>

2310
01:06:47.321 --> 01:06:48.610
<v Speaker 8>I just don't think I could do that.</v>

2311
01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:50.740
<v Speaker 8>And when I look at like Mick Jagger and David Bowie,</v>

2312
01:06:50.741 --> 01:06:52.030
<v Speaker 8>I'm like a wonder if they were like,</v>

2313
01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:52.990

01:06:57.370 --> 01:06:57.940

2317
01:06:57.940 --> 01:06:58.721
<v Speaker 8>I'm a man.</v>

2318
01:06:58.721 --> 01:06:59.501
<v Speaker 8>You're a man.</v>

2319
01:06:59.501 --> 01:06:59.861

2320
01:06:59.861 --> 01:07:02.200
<v Speaker 8>I'm only attracted to women.</v>

2321
01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:07.090
<v Speaker 8>Quintessential rock star with a different spectrum than,</v>

2322
01:07:07.091 --> 01:07:07.924
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2323
01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:08.571
<v Speaker 8>maybe not,</v>

2324
01:07:08.571 --> 01:07:09.090
<v Speaker 8>not too,</v>

2325
01:07:09.090 --> 01:07:10.170
<v Speaker 8>I don't know you're being,</v>

2326
01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:15.010

2327
01:07:15.011 --> 01:07:15.490
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2328
01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:18.640
<v Speaker 8>I think those dudes at that time had,</v>

2329
01:07:18.990 --> 01:07:20.680
<v Speaker 8>had probably been through enough to say,</v>

2330
01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:22.270
<v Speaker 8>I've seen,</v>

2331
01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:23.290
<v Speaker 8>I've been to the limit.</v>

2332
01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:23.621
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

2333
01:07:23.621 --> 01:07:23.830

2334
01:07:23.830 --> 01:07:25.420
<v Speaker 8>I've seen the edge of the cliff debt,</v>

2335
01:07:25.421 --> 01:07:26.620
<v Speaker 8>but that's the old adage.</v>

2336
01:07:26.621 --> 01:07:26.801
<v Speaker 8>Like,</v>

2337

<v Speaker 8>it doesn't happen,</v>

2348
01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:43.680
<v Speaker 8>but,</v>

2349
01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:45.430
<v Speaker 8>but does it happen the other way where a man,</v>

2350
01:07:45.431 --> 01:07:49.750
<v Speaker 8>a straight man has so many different female partners at one day he knew</v>

2355
01:07:59.110 --> 01:08:02.350

2356
01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:04.300
<v Speaker 8>what you do is you reach up with the left arm,</v>

2407
01:09:51.070 --> 01:09:53.340
<v Speaker 1>We live in the same town now.</v>

2408
01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:55.223
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

2409
01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:56.870
<v Speaker 1>You guys aren't living until you don't have apartments.</v>

2410
01:09:56.871 --> 01:09:57.704
<v Speaker 1>Do you?</v>

2411
01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:04.560
<v Speaker 1>When are we going hunting all the time and you want to shoot now?</v>

2412
01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:05.693
<v Speaker 1>What do you want</v>

2413
01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:11.020
<v Speaker 1>honey?</v>

2414
01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:11.853
<v Speaker 1>Honey,</v>

2415
01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:12.140
<v Speaker 1>honey,</v>

2416
01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:13.220
<v Speaker 1>honey goes pig hunting.</v>

2417
01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:14.923
<v Speaker 1>Wild pig hunting.</v>

2418
01:10:15.230 --> 01:10:16.940
<v Speaker 1>We have the most likelihood of success.</v>

2419
01:10:16.941 --> 01:10:18.080
<v Speaker 1>Like if anything that we could do,</v>

2420
01:10:18.130 --> 01:10:18.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2421
01:10:18.341 --> 01:10:19.400
<v Speaker 1>like a close rate.</v>

2422
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:20.540
<v Speaker 1>But we have to take you guys,</v>

2423
01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:21.620
<v Speaker 1>have you shot rifles before</v>

2424
01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:27.350
<v Speaker 1>with two fingers in the same trigger brother.</v>

2425
01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:28.593
<v Speaker 1>I'm just kidding.</v>

2426
01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:33.971
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2427
01:10:33.971 --> 01:10:34.804
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

2428
01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:37.610
<v Speaker 1>and I mistakenly thought it was,</v>

2429
01:10:37.611 --> 01:10:38.444
<v Speaker 1>you have the,</v>

2430
01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:41.330
<v Speaker 1>my friend Cameron Hanes drawing a bow on a nail,</v>

2431
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:44.540
<v Speaker 1>but it really made me think the caption underneath it because it was talking</v>

2432
01:10:44.541 --> 01:10:47.960
<v Speaker 1>about the practice and the discipline that it took to be able to make that shot</v>

2433
01:10:47.961 --> 01:10:50.450
<v Speaker 1>and not hit the deer and the fucking paunch.</v>

2434
01:10:50.451 --> 01:10:52.580
<v Speaker 1>So it's crippled for the rest of his life.</v>

2435
01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:53.414
<v Speaker 1>But not dead.</v>

2436
01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:55.550
<v Speaker 1>And that gave me a new respect for housing honestly,</v>

2437
01:10:55.551 --> 01:10:56.061
<v Speaker 1>because I was like,</v>

2438
01:10:56.061 --> 01:10:59.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to go out there and and shoot something and</v>

2439
01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:01.770
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2440
01:11:01.770 --> 01:11:02.750
<v Speaker 1>it's not about trophy hunting.</v>

2441
01:11:02.751 --> 01:11:07.130
<v Speaker 1>It's about not being a good enough shot or not being skilled enough to be able</v>

2442
01:11:07.131 --> 01:11:09.500
<v Speaker 1>to kill the animal in a humane way.</v>

2443
01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:10.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2444
01:11:10.490 --> 01:11:14.310
<v Speaker 1>it is possible if you go out hunting that you could miss</v>

2445
01:11:14.730 --> 01:11:16.140
<v Speaker 2>and cam has missed.</v>

2446
01:11:16.141 --> 01:11:17.190
<v Speaker 2>Cameron Hanes has missed.</v>

2447
01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:20.250
<v Speaker 2>Steven Rinella is my friend who's a master hunter.</v>

2448
01:11:20.251 --> 01:11:22.830
<v Speaker 2>He has missed and they have all wounded animals.</v>

2449
01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:24.900
<v Speaker 2>It is a part of the process.</v>

2450
01:11:24.930 --> 01:11:26.910
<v Speaker 2>If you deny that part of the process,</v>

2451
01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:28.290
<v Speaker 2>you're being dishonest.</v>

2452
01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:28.770
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2453
01:11:28.770 --> 01:11:33.770
<v Speaker 2>But you need to practice due diligence to make sure that you minimize that and</v>

2454
01:11:33.811 --> 01:11:36.550
<v Speaker 2>as much as is possible and can.</v>

2455
01:11:36.570 --> 01:11:40.230
<v Speaker 2>Haynes post was about my friend Cameron Hanes is a world famous bow hunter.</v>

2456
01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:41.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's very few bow,</v>

<v Speaker 2>hundreds of world famous,</v>

2458

2459
01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:44.880
<v Speaker 2>He runs ultra marathons.</v>

2460
01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:45.630
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2461
01:11:45.630 --> 01:11:46.650
<v Speaker 2>Regularly runs marathons.</v>

2462
01:11:46.651 --> 01:11:47.940
<v Speaker 2>He's run two marathons in a weekend.</v>

2463
01:11:47.941 --> 01:11:49.260
<v Speaker 2>He's running like a Friday marathon.</v>

2464
01:11:49.710 --> 01:11:50.580
<v Speaker 2>Is that the end of the world?</v>

2465
01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:52.290
<v Speaker 2>It could be here it goes.</v>

2466
01:11:52.710 --> 01:11:53.640
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is that?</v>

2467

2524
01:13:58.320 --> 01:13:59.040
<v Speaker 1>That was weird.</v>

2525
01:13:59.040 --> 01:13:59.880
<v Speaker 1>It was so loud.</v>

2526
01:14:00.090 --> 01:14:01.410
<v Speaker 1>We're inside of a building,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Everyone's outside.</v>

2530
01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:09.420
<v Speaker 1>That's why we should really job.</v>

2531
01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:10.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 8>Anybody catch anything?</v>

2535
01:14:13.450 --> 01:14:15.760

2536
01:14:16.150 --> 01:14:16.940
<v Speaker 8>Oh my God.</v>

<v Speaker 8>Quit this fucking job.</v>

2540
01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:22.770
<v Speaker 8>What's the best way he got to Jericho?</v>

2541
01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:24.310
<v Speaker 8>Jerk jerk off while you're flying.</v>

2542
01:14:24.311 --> 01:14:25.330
<v Speaker 8>Go a thousand miles an hour,</v>

2543
01:14:25.331 --> 01:14:26.330
<v Speaker 8>15 feet off the ground</v>

2544
01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:30.013
<v Speaker 8>pressure.</v>

2545
01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.903
<v Speaker 8>I could do it.</v>

2546
01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:31.541
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

2547
01:14:31.541 --> 01:14:32.890
<v Speaker 8>you didn't need all calm and it's like,</v>

2548
01:14:32.891 --> 01:14:33.724
<v Speaker 8>at least you can say you</v>

2549
01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:36.850
<v Speaker 8>do it then it's not.</v>

2550
01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:38.440
<v Speaker 8>Most people won't even question any further.</v>

2551
01:14:38.441 --> 01:14:40.840
<v Speaker 8>I was jerking off in a jet 15 feet off the ground,</v>

2552
01:14:40.841 --> 01:14:42.010
<v Speaker 8>going a thousand miles an hour.</v>

2553
01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:43.773
<v Speaker 8>Was Your Dick hard?</v>

2554
01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:44.833
<v Speaker 8>Why you asking me?</v>

2555
01:14:46.530 --> 01:14:49.180
<v Speaker 8>All you have to do is just start pulling on your Dick and technically speaking,</v>

2556
01:14:49.181 --> 01:14:50.014
<v Speaker 8>you were checking</v>

2557
01:14:55.210 --> 01:14:57.060
<v Speaker 8>out and really,</v>

2558
01:14:57.220 --> 01:14:58.990
<v Speaker 8>really going to town to be jerking off.</v>

2559
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.980
<v Speaker 8>That's not true though,</v>

2560
01:14:59.981 --> 01:15:03.010
<v Speaker 8>because you know a penis that's a man can be three quarters hard,</v>

2561
01:15:03.011 --> 01:15:07.620
<v Speaker 8>half hard and still have the saddest orgasm of shame.</v>

2562
01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:09.550
<v Speaker 8>I know what you're talking about.</v>

2563
01:15:10.090 --> 01:15:12.940
<v Speaker 8>Fucking many orgasms too and it's like I was okay,</v>

2564
01:15:13.710 --> 01:15:14.543
<v Speaker 8>but it's not shame.</v>

2565
01:15:15.490 --> 01:15:17.050
<v Speaker 8>Shame is the feeling of guilt,</v>

2566
01:15:17.051 --> 01:15:17.410
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>

2567
01:15:17.410 --> 01:15:18.243
<v Speaker 8>Here's the difference.</v>

2568
01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:21.100
<v Speaker 8>If a girl calls up a friend that's a guy,</v>

2569
01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:23.860
<v Speaker 8>say of girl calls up a boyfriend and says,</v>

2570
01:15:24.210 --> 01:15:24.620
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>

2571
01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:25.540
<v Speaker 8>I'll just masturbating.</v>

2572
01:15:25.541 --> 01:15:27.100
<v Speaker 8>I had like a half an orgasm,</v>

2573
01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:28.390
<v Speaker 8>the guy will go,</v>

2574
01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:30.250
<v Speaker 8>I'll come over and take care of that.</v>

2575
01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:35.350
<v Speaker 8>[inaudible]</v>

2576
01:15:37.130 --> 01:15:38.210
<v Speaker 8>it sounds like a vocal fry.</v>

2577
01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:41.190
<v Speaker 8>A girl has sex with him.</v>

2578
01:15:41.191 --> 01:15:41.680
<v Speaker 8>He goes,</v>

2579
01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:43.060
<v Speaker 8>I couldn't even totally get it up.</v>

2580
01:15:43.061 --> 01:15:44.320
<v Speaker 8>I just came home myself.</v>

2581
01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:47.170
<v Speaker 8>The girl be like the girl,</v>

2585
01:15:50.591 --> 01:15:51.071

<v Speaker 8>babies.</v>

2599
01:16:16.930 --> 01:16:18.610
<v Speaker 8>We didn't ask for this stupid system.</v>

2600
01:16:18.611 --> 01:16:19.570
<v Speaker 8>We were born into it.</v>

2601
01:16:19.870 --> 01:16:21.130
<v Speaker 8>This goofy ass system,</v>

<v Speaker 8>Whether we like it or not.</v>

2610
01:16:32.081 --> 01:16:34.900
<v Speaker 8>It just takes a lot of time and it's very confusing.</v>

2611
01:16:34.930 --> 01:16:36.250
<v Speaker 8>It's very confusing along the way.</v>

2612
01:16:36.251 --> 01:16:37.061
<v Speaker 8>And we're in the middle of it.</v>

<v Speaker 8>Are we talking in front of everybody?</v>

2730
01:19:59.070 --> 01:20:01.120
<v Speaker 8>I didn't look around happening again.</v>

2731
01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:02.873
<v Speaker 8>Do we run outside?</v>

2732
01:20:03.150 --> 01:20:03.983
<v Speaker 8>Jamie just ran out.</v>

2733
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:05.310
<v Speaker 8>Jamie bringing a camera.</v>

2734
01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:06.233
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2735
01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:07.440
<v Speaker 8>Brian ran to,</v>

2736
01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:08.820
<v Speaker 8>what the fuck is going on?</v>

2737
01:20:09.450 --> 01:20:11.520
<v Speaker 8>Is this to naval base?</v>

2738
01:20:11.521 --> 01:20:14.820
<v Speaker 8>I don't think this is that big of a deal where we are.</v>

2739
01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:16.620
<v Speaker 8>Here's the problem.</v>

2740
01:20:16.621 --> 01:20:17.460
<v Speaker 8>White privilege.</v>

2741
01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:23.340
<v Speaker 8>We're sitting here and fucking Canoga park thinking about what's going</v>

2742
01:20:23.410 --> 01:20:24.000
<v Speaker 8>privilege.</v>

2743
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:24.121
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

2744
01:20:24.121 --> 01:20:24.954
<v Speaker 8>me too.</v>

2745
01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:26.183
<v Speaker 8>Me Too.</v>

2746
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:27.720
<v Speaker 8>Christine trainor jets going over.</v>

2747
01:20:27.721 --> 01:20:29.500
<v Speaker 8>That doesn't have anything to do with breath,</v>

2748
01:20:29.570 --> 01:20:30.000
<v Speaker 8>bro.</v>

2749
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.460
<v Speaker 8>I'm kind of keeping in Russia and it's all gonna make sense.</v>

2750
01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:38.000
<v Speaker 8>What I'm saying is we look at war as something that happens in another place and</v>

2751
01:20:38.521 --> 01:20:39.510
<v Speaker 8>we support war.</v>

2752
01:20:39.511 --> 01:20:40.660
<v Speaker 8>If we do support war,</v>

2753
01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:44.610
<v Speaker 8>it has to come anywhere near us.</v>

2754
01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:46.890
<v Speaker 8>We never think that it has to come anywhere near us.</v>

2755
01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:47.813
<v Speaker 8>We just don't.</v>

2756
01:20:47.820 --> 01:20:49.500
<v Speaker 8>We think that it's happening in Iraq.</v>

2757
01:20:49.710 --> 01:20:51.030
<v Speaker 8>It's happened in Afghanistan.</v>

2758
01:20:51.031 --> 01:20:53.230
<v Speaker 8>It's been happening there for tow.</v>

2759
01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:54.900
<v Speaker 8>Well fucking years.</v>

2760
01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:55.913
<v Speaker 8>More than that.</v>

2761
01:20:56.250 --> 01:20:59.410
<v Speaker 8>Thousands of years with us now.</v>

2762
01:21:00.050 --> 01:21:01.200
<v Speaker 8>He's going to make sure it's okay.</v>

2763
01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:02.011
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

2764
01:21:02.011 --> 01:21:05.370
<v Speaker 8>he is one of the best investigative reporters and the Los Angeles area.</v>

2765
01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:08.240
<v Speaker 8>So prior to the world,</v>

2766
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:10.710
<v Speaker 8>Brian Band is on the case.</v>

2767
01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:12.030
<v Speaker 8>He's out there smoking a cigarette.</v>

2768
01:21:12.270 --> 01:21:13.360
<v Speaker 8>He's going to come back inside.</v>

2769
01:21:13.361 --> 01:21:13.831
<v Speaker 8>It's going to go.</v>

2770
01:21:13.831 --> 01:21:14.740
<v Speaker 8>I was looking at it.</v>

2771
01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:16.133
<v Speaker 8>Of course he is.</v>

2772
01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:17.461
<v Speaker 8>Of course he is.</v>

2773
01:21:17.461 --> 01:21:18.300
<v Speaker 8>He can't help himself.</v>

2774
01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:19.223
<v Speaker 8>He's a junkie.</v>

2775
01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:20.333
<v Speaker 8>Poor bastard.</v>

2776
01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:22.500
<v Speaker 8>You don't need to do this vape pen.</v>

2777
01:21:22.530 --> 01:21:22.951
<v Speaker 8>Don't work.</v>

2778
01:21:22.951 --> 01:21:24.450
<v Speaker 8>Do you want to go out there with them and smoke cigarettes</v>

2779
01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:28.590
<v Speaker 8>and I quit my vape pens</v>

2780
01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:35.100
<v Speaker 8>is that might be fucking RJ Reynolds propaganda,</v>

2781
01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:35.671
<v Speaker 8>whatever.</v>

2782
01:21:35.671 --> 01:21:36.361
<v Speaker 8>I feel fine.</v>

2783
01:21:36.361 --> 01:21:37.350
<v Speaker 8>I don't smoke them anymore.</v>

2784
01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:39.360
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

2785
01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:42.090
<v Speaker 8>I definitely felt more like tension.</v>

2786
01:21:42.570 --> 01:21:43.350
<v Speaker 8>Let you,</v>

2803
01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:10.620
<v Speaker 8>The Guy who developed this,</v>

2836
01:23:03.890 --> 01:23:04.723
<v Speaker 8>Freedom.</v>

2837
01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:05.813
<v Speaker 8>I'm driving.</v>

2838
01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:07.470
<v Speaker 2>Joey has always says that about our,</v>

2839
01:23:07.530 --> 01:23:08.500
<v Speaker 2>our pal Eddie Bravo,</v>

2840
01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:09.281
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Bravo.</v>

2841
01:23:09.281 --> 01:23:11.760
<v Speaker 2>We'll get a couple of drinks and get a little fucking great.</v>

2842
01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:13.360
<v Speaker 2>I Love Eddie Brown was my brother,</v>

2843
01:23:13.570 --> 01:23:14.230
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

2844
01:23:14.230 --> 01:23:15.063
<v Speaker 2>Eddie,</v>

2845
01:23:15.070 --> 01:23:19.540
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Bravo even adopt the phrase Joey Dee has called that when the Indian comes</v>

2846
01:23:19.541 --> 01:23:19.990
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

2847
01:23:19.990 --> 01:23:24.490
<v Speaker 2>because South Americans are essentially like Mexicans and especially our</v>

2848
01:23:24.491 --> 01:23:25.310
<v Speaker 2>Indians.</v>

2849
01:23:25.310 --> 01:23:25.510
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2850
01:23:25.510 --> 01:23:30.280
<v Speaker 2>Mixed with Spaniards that came in like they didn't originally apparently speak.</v>

2851
01:23:30.310 --> 01:23:30.700
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2852
01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:31.030
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2853
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:31.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2854
01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:31.781
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>

2855
01:23:31.781 --> 01:23:32.614
<v Speaker 2>in Spaniards,</v>

2856
01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:33.970
<v Speaker 2>the ink is in the Spaniards.</v>

2857
01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:35.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is like,</v>

2858
01:23:35.230 --> 01:23:37.300
<v Speaker 2>that's the root of a lot of people from Mexico.</v>

2859
01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:38.950
<v Speaker 2>That's why there's like Spaniard,</v>

2860
01:23:38.951 --> 01:23:40.260
<v Speaker 2>like Oscar de la Jolla,</v>

2861
01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:40.630
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2862
01:23:40.630 --> 01:23:43.810
<v Speaker 2>Looking Mexicans and then there's a double Hawkins.</v>

2863
01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:45.153
<v Speaker 2>That's more of a,</v>

2864
01:23:45.370 --> 01:23:45.521
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2865
01:23:45.521 --> 01:23:46.261
<v Speaker 2>there's some Mexicans.</v>

2866
01:23:46.261 --> 01:23:48.230
<v Speaker 2>It looked very native American right now.</v>

2867
01:23:48.970 --> 01:23:49.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2868
01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:50.330
<v Speaker 2>but that's what Joey Diaz,</v>

2869
01:23:50.350 --> 01:23:51.670
<v Speaker 2>you say the Indians coming out,</v>

2870
01:23:53.020 --> 01:23:54.100
<v Speaker 2>fucking Indians coming out.</v>

2871
01:23:54.150 --> 01:23:57.070
<v Speaker 2>It's an Indians and they're notorious issues with alcohol.</v>

2872
01:23:57.440 --> 01:23:57.860
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>

2873
01:23:57.860 --> 01:23:58.210

3019
01:27:30.050 --> 01:27:32.120
<v Speaker 4>Nobody teaches us how to talk to girls.</v>

3020
01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:35.420
<v Speaker 4>We just sort of have to figure it out when we're 13 when we do a terrible job</v>

3021
01:27:35.421 --> 01:27:40.421
<v Speaker 4>for the first seven or 14 years of our lives and then somewhere around 30 slowly</v>

3022
01:27:42.340 --> 01:27:46.480
<v Speaker 4>girls date older guys and then you get into trouble while you better than when</v>

3023
01:27:46.481 --> 01:27:47.070
<v Speaker 4>you make some lists.</v>

3024
01:27:47.070 --> 01:27:47.903
<v Speaker 4>Your poach.</v>

3025
01:27:48.050 --> 01:27:49.820
<v Speaker 4>It's what I was talking about with writing before earlier.</v>

3026
01:27:49.820 --> 01:27:52.670
<v Speaker 4>I think he's just letting it flow slip too worried about it now.</v>

3027
01:27:52.671 --> 01:27:54.710
<v Speaker 4>You calculated looking for Mrs Ben.</v>

3028
01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:56.870
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting better.</v>

3029
01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:57.980
<v Speaker 4>Better.</v>

3030
01:27:57.980 --> 01:28:00.380
<v Speaker 4>How about where you were at your worst when you're like,</v>

3031
01:28:00.381 --> 01:28:05.381
<v Speaker 4>I've hit rock bottom probably 24 25 we'll be doing kind of like an air of</v>

3032
01:28:05.481 --> 01:28:06.620
<v Speaker 4>desperation and everything.</v>

3033
01:28:06.621 --> 01:28:07.454
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

3034
01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:08.833
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3035
01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:13.940
<v Speaker 4>I've never had like the single years.</v>

3036
01:28:14.030 --> 01:28:14.863
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

3037
01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:15.703
<v Speaker 4>I've always been like,</v>

3038
01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:17.660
<v Speaker 4>go on girlfriend and his girlfriend.</v>

3039
01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:18.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3040
01:28:18.010 --> 01:28:22.670
<v Speaker 4>that's what a single years are great if you're successful,</v>

3041
01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:24.590
<v Speaker 4>but if you're unsuccessful,</v>

3042
01:28:24.591 --> 01:28:26.060
<v Speaker 4>it's horrible and lonely.</v>

3043
01:28:26.570 --> 01:28:27.620
<v Speaker 4>It can be very sad.</v>

3044
01:28:27.950 --> 01:28:30.530
<v Speaker 4>And there's also that sort of like stigma of like,</v>

3045
01:28:30.531 --> 01:28:31.221
<v Speaker 4>I'm the man,</v>

3046
01:28:31.221 --> 01:28:32.990
<v Speaker 4>I need to take the lady out and impress her,</v>

3047
01:28:32.991 --> 01:28:35.720
<v Speaker 4>but it's like sleeping on my friend's couch for two months.</v>

3048
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.860
<v Speaker 4>Do you want to go out?</v>

3049
01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:37.641
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3050
01:28:37.641 --> 01:28:38.061
<v Speaker 4>There's that.</v>

3051
01:28:38.061 --> 01:28:39.500
<v Speaker 4>Also that thing that you realize,</v>

3052
01:28:39.501 --> 01:28:42.680
<v Speaker 4>like when you're really struggling as an artist,</v>

3053
01:28:42.681 --> 01:28:43.940
<v Speaker 4>I guess as a musician,</v>

3054
01:28:44.330 --> 01:28:46.310
<v Speaker 4>definitely as a comedian it's very similar,</v>

3055
01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:47.240
<v Speaker 4>but you don't,</v>

3056
01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:47.601
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3057
01:28:47.601 --> 01:28:48.434
<v Speaker 4>you know</v>

3058
01:28:49.730 --> 01:28:54.060
<v Speaker 4>nothing pure wits go along way.</v>

3059
01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:55.110
<v Speaker 4>I think that if,</v>

3060
01:28:55.110 --> 01:29:00.050
<v Speaker 4>if wherever you're at and who you are and where you're going is up to where</v>

3061
01:29:00.051 --> 01:29:01.800
<v Speaker 4>you're going is up to whatever,</v>

3062
01:29:01.801 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 4>I don't</v>

3063
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.903
<v Speaker 1>fucking know.</v>

3064
01:29:02.930 --> 01:29:03.763
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

3065
01:29:04.770 --> 01:29:05.603
<v Speaker 1>the ether</v>

3066
01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:08.430
<v Speaker 1>playing guitar.</v>

3067
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:09.991
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3068
01:29:09.991 --> 01:29:10.430
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

3069
01:29:10.430 --> 01:29:10.980
<v Speaker 1>Buddha,</v>

3070
01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:11.370
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

3071
01:29:11.370 --> 01:29:11.970
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

3072
01:29:11.970 --> 01:29:13.260
<v Speaker 1>when you meet somebody that's like,</v>

3073
01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:14.520
<v Speaker 1>I think you're fucking awesome.</v>

3074
01:29:14.521 --> 01:29:14.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

3075
01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:19.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't care that you're not where you want to be financially or professionally.</v>

3076
01:29:19.170 --> 01:29:20.003
<v Speaker 1>I think you're awesome.</v>

3077
01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:23.250
<v Speaker 1>That's the best time check on that motherfucker.</v>

3078
01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:27.213

01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:41.970
<v Speaker 1>Two guys that wear women's deodorant.</v>

3089
01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:43.280

3090
01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:44.160
<v Speaker 1>So I was like peaches,</v>

3091
01:29:44.750 --> 01:29:45.900
<v Speaker 1>but I wear men's deodorant,</v>

3095
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:51.833
<v Speaker 1>Brian Calendar.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So clean.</v>

3097
01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.040
<v Speaker 1>Brian Callen just told me about some natural dealer to try.</v>

3098
01:29:57.420 --> 01:30:00.290
<v Speaker 1>He said it's like an aloe vera based deodorant that really works.</v>

3099
01:30:00.310 --> 01:30:01.143
<v Speaker 1>It's a natural healer.</v>

3100
01:30:01.170 --> 01:30:04.110
<v Speaker 1>He and he's the first one to tell you that natural deodorants are most,</v>

3101
01:30:04.530 --> 01:30:05.071
<v Speaker 1>most of the time,</v>

3102
01:30:05.071 --> 01:30:07.020
<v Speaker 1>their bullshit last long.</v>

3103
01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:09.000
<v Speaker 1>Usually it's usually they last a couple of hours.</v>

3104
01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:10.600
<v Speaker 1>It depends how smelly you are.</v>

3105
01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:13.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm just thinking one of the four yard he went to them</v>

3106
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:18.930
<v Speaker 1>strong enough for a man made for men.</v>

3107
01:30:20.010 --> 01:30:20.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3108
01:30:20.350 --> 01:30:21.183
<v Speaker 1>I'm not</v>

3109
01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:24.420
<v Speaker 1>strong enough for man,</v>

3110
01:30:24.421 --> 01:30:25.254
<v Speaker 1>but made for a woman.</v>

3111
01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:26.093
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3112
01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:26.431
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3113
01:30:26.431 --> 01:30:28.140
<v Speaker 1>If I put it on this going to be problems.</v>

3114
01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:29.303
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

01:30:31.260 --> 01:30:32.093
<v Speaker 1>Like my</v>

<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

3122
01:30:40.381 --> 01:30:41.850
<v Speaker 1>But not strong enough for a man.</v>

3123
01:30:41.851 --> 01:30:43.020
<v Speaker 1>But made for a woman.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's made for a woman.</v>

3131
01:30:50.250 --> 01:30:55.080
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that funny how like one advertising slogan like that can just fucking give</v>

3132
01:30:55.081 --> 01:30:55.470

<v Speaker 1>I wasn't into it.</v>

3146
01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:24.620
<v Speaker 1>When we find out that some people drink like eight or nine of those in a day,</v>

3147
01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:27.460
<v Speaker 1>you know more on the road you see,</v>

3158
01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:45.960
<v Speaker 1>Just drink water and then drink beer later.</v>

3159
01:31:45.961 --> 01:31:48.870
<v Speaker 1>The good step and saying that for years I was looking at the back of some</v>

3163
01:31:57.511 --> 01:31:59.320
<v Speaker 1>And I realize what these dudes are doing.</v>

3164
01:31:59.321 --> 01:32:01.840
<v Speaker 1>Cause sometimes I actually think about this cause we drive so much and I'm like,</v>

3165
01:32:01.841 --> 01:32:02.830
<v Speaker 1>if this doesn't work out,</v>

3170
01:32:07.571 --> 01:32:11.740
<v Speaker 1>because I've driven so fucking much that sometimes I think about that coming to</v>

01:32:11.741 --> 01:32:12.574
<v Speaker 1>my head.</v>

3172

3174
01:32:15.170 --> 01:32:15.910

01:36:07.710 --> 01:36:10.670
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't help a lot when I've got him.</v>

3310
01:36:10.671 --> 01:36:13.050
<v Speaker 4>I'm being misogynistic when I'm struggling in a,</v>

<v Speaker 4>in you come up and save me.</v>

<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3324
01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:19.980
<v Speaker 1>That's a little,</v>

3325
01:36:19.980 --> 01:36:21.110
<v Speaker 1>besides gender.</v>

3326
01:36:21.890 --> 01:36:23.140
<v Speaker 1>Sam was a man.</v>

3327
01:36:23.141 --> 01:36:27.970
<v Speaker 1>If you were were Sam instead of Suzanne and a man had a save you every time you</v>

3328

<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

3331
01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:33.333
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

3332
01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:34.590
<v Speaker 4>I think you need to let go of that.</v>

3333
01:36:34.591 --> 01:36:38.930
<v Speaker 4>We're partners so we take care of each other and I know you can answer.</v>

3334
01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:41.880
<v Speaker 4>If I were a dude I was like,</v>

3337
01:36:46.530 --> 01:36:48.210
<v Speaker 4>Brody Stevens is 84% gay.</v>

3338
01:36:48.211 --> 01:36:48.720
<v Speaker 4>Who's Brody?</v>

3339
01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:50.460
<v Speaker 4>And you don't know who that is either.</v>

3340
01:36:50.470 --> 01:36:50.930
<v Speaker 4>Just fuck ups.</v>

3341
01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:51.763

01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:53.573
<v Speaker 4>is that your dad?</v>

3343
01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:57.510
<v Speaker 4>You might as well be.</v>

3344
01:36:57.511 --> 01:36:58.680
<v Speaker 4>I'd love him like a father.</v>

3345
01:36:59.910 --> 01:37:00.743
<v Speaker 4>What's your question?</v>

3346
01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:01.950
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3347
01:37:01.950 --> 01:37:02.460
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

3348
01:37:02.460 --> 01:37:05.400
<v Speaker 4>so it didn't smoke weed for a while and I do every once in a while and I feel</v>

3349
01:37:05.401 --> 01:37:07.950
<v Speaker 4>like I get a cognitive boost when I do it.</v>

3350
01:37:08.100 --> 01:37:09.120
<v Speaker 4>Am I crazy?</v>

3351
01:37:09.300 --> 01:37:09.720
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3352
01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:10.800
<v Speaker 4>What is that?</v>

3353
01:37:10.801 --> 01:37:14.280
<v Speaker 4>What element of marijuana slash THC is doing that?</v>

3354
01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:15.030
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3355
01:37:15.030 --> 01:37:15.870
<v Speaker 4>it's like cocaine.</v>

3356
01:37:15.871 --> 01:37:17.430
<v Speaker 4>Ps shot that there's a rule.</v>

3357
01:37:17.431 --> 01:37:19.800
<v Speaker 4>Ben Can't smoke weed when we're working cause he's like,</v>

3358
01:37:20.910 --> 01:37:21.743
<v Speaker 4>you want to do this?</v>

3359
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:24.511
<v Speaker 4>Just just to,</v>

3360
01:37:24.511 --> 01:37:26.100
<v Speaker 4>just to frame the situation.</v>

3361
01:37:26.550 --> 01:37:26.911
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3362
01:37:26.911 --> 01:37:28.680
<v Speaker 4>if we have to do an all night drive,</v>

3363
01:37:28.830 --> 01:37:31.050
<v Speaker 4>I'll smoke because I can't fall asleep.</v>

3364
01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:31.920
<v Speaker 4>Fine.</v>

3365
01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:32.281
<v Speaker 4>Literally,</v>

3366
01:37:32.281 --> 01:37:34.470
<v Speaker 4>if I smoke be about five hours before I go to sleep.</v>

3367
01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:35.281
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3368
01:37:35.281 --> 01:37:40.281
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine it's because the way your body reacts to cannabis is that your</v>

3369
01:37:40.681 --> 01:37:41.514
<v Speaker 4>body,</v>

3370
01:37:41.630 --> 01:37:45.060
<v Speaker 4>your creativity starts to fire up and your,</v>

3371
01:37:45.090 --> 01:37:45.840
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

3372
01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:50.580
<v Speaker 4>your mind starts to embrace different possibilities then you would do if you</v>

3373
01:37:50.581 --> 01:37:51.390
<v Speaker 4>were sober.</v>

3374
01:37:51.390 --> 01:37:56.070
<v Speaker 4>It relaxes your inhibitions a little and lets you pursue ideas that maybe</v>

3375
01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:59.490
<v Speaker 2>because of the fact that you're in this precarious position in your career and</v>

3376
01:37:59.491 --> 01:38:02.100
<v Speaker 2>your life and that you're constantly filled with anx.</v>

3377
01:38:02.101 --> 01:38:05.850
<v Speaker 2>Like most 30 year old men may not shine easy.</v>

3378
01:38:05.970 --> 01:38:06.271
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

3383
01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:16.621
<v Speaker 2>Oh right.</v>

3384
01:38:16.621 --> 01:38:18.620
<v Speaker 2>We have real jobs is the toughest.</v>

3385
01:38:19.180 --> 01:38:19.670

3388
01:38:20.911 --> 01:38:21.361
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

3389
01:38:21.361 --> 01:38:22.194
<v Speaker 2>What's a real job?</v>

3390
01:38:22.810 --> 01:38:23.130
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

3391
01:38:23.130 --> 01:38:24.060
<v Speaker 2>this is what a real job.</v>

3392
01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:25.290
<v Speaker 2>A real job.</v>

3393
01:38:25.290 --> 01:38:25.461
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3394
01:38:25.461 --> 01:38:25.531
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3395
01:38:25.531 --> 01:38:25.681
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3396
01:38:25.681 --> 01:38:26.101
<v Speaker 2>Trust me.</v>

3397
01:38:26.101 --> 01:38:26.460
<v Speaker 2>Trust me.</v>

3398
01:38:26.460 --> 01:38:27.060
<v Speaker 2>Trust me.</v>

3399
01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:28.920
<v Speaker 2>A real job was doing something you don't want to do,</v>

3400
01:38:28.921 --> 01:38:29.820
<v Speaker 2>but you do it anyway.</v>

3401
01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:30.970
<v Speaker 2>We don't have real jobs.</v>

3402
01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:31.470
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

3403
01:38:31.470 --> 01:38:32.303
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a real job,</v>

3404
01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:33.631
<v Speaker 2>a real job?</v>

3405
01:38:33.631 --> 01:38:34.351
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a real job.</v>

3406
01:38:34.351 --> 01:38:35.310
<v Speaker 2>There's no real jobs here.</v>

3407
01:38:35.370 --> 01:38:35.971
<v Speaker 2>There's no real job.</v>

3408
01:38:35.971 --> 01:38:39.870
<v Speaker 2>So that's a big part of aging is to regret and despair.</v>

3409
01:38:39.900 --> 01:38:41.130
<v Speaker 2>You're not in the weeds anymore.</v>

3410
01:38:41.131 --> 01:38:41.761
<v Speaker 2>You're smoking.</v>

3411
01:38:41.761 --> 01:38:44.300
<v Speaker 2>Weed's perfectly said,</v>

3412
01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:45.270
<v Speaker 2>perfectly said.</v>

3413
01:38:45.540 --> 01:38:46.950
<v Speaker 2>That's the perfect way to say it.</v>

3414
01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:49.140
<v Speaker 2>And my point being,</v>

3415
01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:50.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3416
01:38:50.810 --> 01:38:53.580
<v Speaker 2>everybody who,</v>

3417
01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:54.930
<v Speaker 2>who smokes weed,</v>

3418
01:38:54.931 --> 01:38:56.820
<v Speaker 2>who doesn't smoke very often has a big,</v>

3419
01:38:56.850 --> 01:38:58.050
<v Speaker 2>it has a big impact on you.</v>

3420
01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:02.190
<v Speaker 2>W marijuana is one of those things where it hits you when you don't do it a lot.</v>

3421
01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:03.570
<v Speaker 2>It hits you harder,</v>

3422
01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:08.400
<v Speaker 2>faster and more profoundly because you have these things in your brain,</v>

3423
01:39:08.430 --> 01:39:08.971
<v Speaker 2>allegedly,</v>

3424
01:39:08.971 --> 01:39:12.930
<v Speaker 2>apparently from what I've read called cannabinoid receptors that are literally</v>

3425
01:39:12.931 --> 01:39:15.540
<v Speaker 2>designed to accept the,</v>

3426
01:39:15.541 --> 01:39:17.340
<v Speaker 2>the influence of cannabis.</v>

3427
01:39:17.870 --> 01:39:19.440
<v Speaker 2>And then that's what they're there for.</v>

3428
01:39:19.470 --> 01:39:24.470
<v Speaker 2>And it comes from just gigantic history of human beings consuming cannabis.</v>

3429
01:39:24.511 --> 01:39:26.550
<v Speaker 2>If these cannabinoid receptors are also fired,</v>

3430
01:39:26.551 --> 01:39:29.280
<v Speaker 2>they believe when people do like long distance running,</v>

3431
01:39:29.281 --> 01:39:30.091
<v Speaker 2>like jogging,</v>

3432
01:39:30.091 --> 01:39:31.680
<v Speaker 2>like people say they get that runner's high,</v>

3433
01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:35.410
<v Speaker 2>it has a similar sort of enough endorphins.</v>

3434
01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:35.641
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3435
01:39:35.641 --> 01:39:37.830
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of different things that happened inside the mind.</v>

3436
01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:40.410
<v Speaker 2>There's different neurotransmitters that get activated.</v>

3437
01:39:40.411 --> 01:39:42.210
<v Speaker 2>There's dopamine and Serotonin,</v>

3438
01:39:42.211 --> 01:39:43.740
<v Speaker 2>a lot of those or exercise related,</v>

3439
01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:47.910
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of those are also related to the consumption of psychedelic plants and</v>

3440
01:39:47.911 --> 01:39:49.110
<v Speaker 2>marijuana is a big one.</v>

3441
01:39:49.140 --> 01:39:51.060
<v Speaker 2>It's a giant part c.</v>

3442
01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:55.620
<v Speaker 2>We have this fucking idea that everything that is the way it is from the time</v>

3443
01:39:55.621 --> 01:39:59.040
<v Speaker 2>that we've been alive and our parents had been alive and the fucking just say no</v>

3444
01:39:59.041 --> 01:40:01.260
<v Speaker 2>to drugs from the Reagan administration was there.</v>

3445
01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:03.210
<v Speaker 2>That this is the way the world has always been.</v>

3446
01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:04.073
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

3447
01:40:04.230 --> 01:40:08.640
<v Speaker 2>The world has been about consuming cannabis for thousands and thousands and</v>

3448
01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:09.330
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years,</v>

3449
01:40:09.330 --> 01:40:13.710
<v Speaker 2>but we're growing up in a society where fucking financial interest to figured</v>

3450
01:40:13.711 --> 01:40:17.970
<v Speaker 2>out a way to control the consumption of gigantic amounts of people.</v>

3451
01:40:18.270 --> 01:40:22.020
<v Speaker 2>The consumption of one of the most fantastic plants the world has ever known.</v>

3452
01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:26.460
<v Speaker 2>So when you do get ahold of one and it fires you up and you start thinking about</v>

3453
01:40:26.461 --> 01:40:28.290
<v Speaker 2>shit and you're flying through space,</v>

3454
01:40:28.291 --> 01:40:30.180
<v Speaker 2>you have all these ideas what it is,</v>

3455
01:40:30.181 --> 01:40:33.420
<v Speaker 2>is it because it's awesome.</v>

3456
01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:34.733
<v Speaker 2>That's why.</v>

3457
01:40:35.060 --> 01:40:38.610
<v Speaker 2>That's the only reason why you smoke it and you just can't shut the fuck up</v>

3458
01:40:38.611 --> 01:40:39.870
<v Speaker 2>cause you driving across country.</v>

3459
01:40:40.020 --> 01:40:42.270
<v Speaker 2>Those are thoughts that you're caging up in your mind.</v>

3460
01:40:42.271 --> 01:40:46.320
<v Speaker 2>Like you're fucking like you got a Pinata of ideas and you come along with a</v>

3461
01:40:46.321 --> 01:40:48.170
<v Speaker 2>hatchet and the hatchet and is,</v>

3462
01:40:48.260 --> 01:40:52.980
<v Speaker 2>it's in the shape of a joint and you fire up that joint and just shop away at</v>

3463
01:40:52.990 --> 01:40:57.990
<v Speaker 2>that stupid fucking fake elephant and candy comes pouring out and that candy is</v>

3464
01:40:58.271 --> 01:41:02.290
<v Speaker 2>these ideas that you've been sort of containing in your mind and storing up and</v>

3465
01:41:02.620 --> 01:41:07.620
<v Speaker 2>processing with no outlet and just just chemically,</v>

3466
01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:09.490
<v Speaker 2>chemically what's doing that.</v>

3467
01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:10.930
<v Speaker 2>Like what you have to re,</v>

3468
01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:12.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm obviously not a neuroscientist.</v>

3469
01:41:12.930 --> 01:41:13.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh okay.</v>

3470
01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:14.770
<v Speaker 2>Probably have brain damage.</v>

3471
01:41:15.190 --> 01:41:16.023
<v Speaker 10>You shouldn't do it.</v>

3472
01:41:16.570 --> 01:41:18.160
<v Speaker 10>I would suggest if I wasn't</v>

3473
01:41:18.230 --> 01:41:18.501
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

3474
01:41:18.501 --> 01:41:19.820
<v Speaker 2>I would say don't listen to that dude.</v>

3475
01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:23.810
<v Speaker 2>He's probably got a couple good ideas that he memorized some website,</v>

3476
01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:26.240
<v Speaker 2>but everything else is most likely nonsense.</v>

3477
01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:29.930
<v Speaker 2>So we should do is Google Google the marijuana is affecting the mind and just</v>

3478
01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:31.960
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of bullshit out</v>

3479
01:41:31.990 --> 01:41:32.160
<v Speaker 5>that's there.</v>

3480
01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:32.993
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of,</v>

3481
01:41:33.230 --> 01:41:34.031
<v Speaker 5>I mean he has,</v>

3482
01:41:34.031 --> 01:41:35.260
<v Speaker 5>I think it affects everyone.</v>

3483
01:41:35.261 --> 01:41:35.801
<v Speaker 5>Very different.</v>

3484
01:41:35.801 --> 01:41:36.290
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3485
01:41:36.290 --> 01:41:37.123
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>

3486
01:41:37.230 --> 01:41:39.580
<v Speaker 5>which is the same street that we could smoke together.</v>

3487
01:41:39.700 --> 01:41:39.890
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>

3488
01:41:39.890 --> 01:41:40.070
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>

3489
01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.601
<v Speaker 2>Is it though?</v>

3490
01:41:40.601 --> 01:41:41.530
<v Speaker 2>Because that's everything.</v>

3491
01:41:41.780 --> 01:41:42.613
<v Speaker 2>Peanuts.</v>

3492
01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:43.331
<v Speaker 2>Some people,</v>

3493
01:41:43.331 --> 01:41:44.140
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3494
01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:44.973
<v Speaker 2>Some people,</v>

3495
01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:47.770
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's a minority.</v>

3496
01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:48.680
<v Speaker 2>That's a tiny mine.</v>

3497
01:41:49.110 --> 01:41:49.390
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3498
01:41:49.390 --> 01:41:49.571
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3499
01:41:49.571 --> 01:41:49.841
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

3502
01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:50.741
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3503
01:41:50.741 --> 01:41:52.300
<v Speaker 2>it's not a minority.</v>

3504
01:41:52.510 --> 01:41:56.410
<v Speaker 2>It's a minority in terms of it's less than a hundred percent of the population</v>

3505
01:41:56.670 --> 01:42:00.460
<v Speaker 2>is less than 50% it's probably less than 10% of people who are allergic to like</v>

3506
01:42:00.910 --> 01:42:01.750
<v Speaker 2>whatever cats.</v>

3507
01:42:01.830 --> 01:42:04.450
<v Speaker 2>There's people that will die if they in the room filled with cats.</v>

3508
01:42:04.510 --> 01:42:04.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3509
01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:05.703
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3510
01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:06.970
<v Speaker 2>firing diversity's real</v>

3511
01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:07.161
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>

3512
01:42:07.161 --> 01:42:07.491
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

3513
01:42:07.491 --> 01:42:10.700
<v Speaker 5>it's like you could drink a glass of wine and be fine.</v>

3514
01:42:10.701 --> 01:42:14.630
<v Speaker 5>You could drink a glass of vodka and be a fucking lunatic.</v>

3515
01:42:14.870 --> 01:42:15.210
<v Speaker 5>Every,</v>

3516
01:42:15.210 --> 01:42:17.930
<v Speaker 5>it's know your body receives these things.</v>

3517
01:42:17.931 --> 01:42:18.141
<v Speaker 5>Is,</v>

3518
01:42:18.141 --> 01:42:19.490
<v Speaker 5>is complex.</v>

3519
01:42:19.491 --> 01:42:20.810
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

3520
01:42:21.020 --> 01:42:22.490
<v Speaker 2>but that's just alcohol by volume,</v>

3521
01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:23.031
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3522
01:42:23.031 --> 01:42:23.810
<v Speaker 2>what is your address?</v>

3523
01:42:23.810 --> 01:42:27.050
<v Speaker 2>Glass of wine or a certain amount of glass of vodka has much more.</v>

3524
01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:27.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3525
01:42:27.610 --> 01:42:30.940
<v Speaker 5>Well it's just basically talking about what you were just saying is that every</v>

3526
01:42:30.941 --> 01:42:31.661
<v Speaker 5>person is different.</v>

3527
01:42:31.661 --> 01:42:32.980
<v Speaker 5>Everything affects them differently.</v>

3528
01:42:33.130 --> 01:42:33.850
<v Speaker 5>Definitely.</v>

3529
01:42:33.850 --> 01:42:36.040
<v Speaker 5>I'm really sensitive to weed.</v>

3530
01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:37.570
<v Speaker 5>Do you get high just being in this room?</v>

3531
01:42:38.110 --> 01:42:40.080
<v Speaker 5>I'm fucking off my rocker right now.</v>

3566
01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:27.740
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just cause you don't do it a lot.</v>

01:44:04.401 --> 01:44:08.570
<v Speaker 8>Your fault that the baby Jesus did not bless you with the proper Dick Chemicals.</v>

3592
01:44:09.050 --> 01:44:09.291
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

3593
01:44:09.291 --> 01:44:10.124

<v Speaker 8>I just gotta.</v>

3595
01:44:11.530 --> 01:44:12.760
<v Speaker 8>I gotta live with what I got.</v>

3596
01:44:12.761 --> 01:44:14.390
<v Speaker 8>I don't have to live with what you got.</v>

3597
01:44:14.391 --> 01:44:19.391
<v Speaker 8>What he got smarter then the Creator people have figured Viagara via,</v>

3598
01:44:20.781 --> 01:44:21.110
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3599
01:44:21.110 --> 01:44:21.831
<v Speaker 8>the Creator said,</v>

3600
01:44:21.831 --> 01:44:22.310
<v Speaker 8>listen,</v>

3601
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:25.880
<v Speaker 8>I want you to hit about 52 53 and you Dick's,</v>

3602
01:44:25.881 --> 01:44:26.540
<v Speaker 8>Jenna,</v>

3603
01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:27.890
<v Speaker 8>punch out desk.</v>

3604
01:44:27.940 --> 01:44:28.100
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

3605
01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:28.840
<v Speaker 8>that's the best.</v>

3606
01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:31.550
<v Speaker 3>Says my dad is 63 when he had me.</v>

3607
01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:32.181
<v Speaker 3>Do you watch him?</v>

3608
01:44:32.181 --> 01:44:33.014
<v Speaker 3>Fuck</v>

3609
01:44:33.490 --> 01:44:34.323
<v Speaker 8>every time.</v>

3610
01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:37.510
<v Speaker 8>Takes every single time.</v>

3611
01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:40.560
<v Speaker 8>It probably takes bamboo and ties it to his dick.</v>

3612
01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:43.840
<v Speaker 8>Stretches it out to keep it hard then tapes it and place.</v>

3613
01:44:44.860 --> 01:44:45.740
<v Speaker 8>Thank you for saying that.</v>

3614
01:44:46.860 --> 01:44:47.441
<v Speaker 8>When you watch them,</v>

3615
01:44:47.441 --> 01:44:48.550
<v Speaker 8>do you just look back at it?</v>

3616
01:44:48.980 --> 01:44:49.810
<v Speaker 8>I hate it.</v>

3617
01:44:49.810 --> 01:44:51.640
<v Speaker 8>It's kind of like seeing my own future.</v>

3618
01:44:51.870 --> 01:44:53.590
<v Speaker 8>He's on tape and kite string.</v>

3619
01:44:53.740 --> 01:44:54.970
<v Speaker 8>He just keeps his cock.</v>

3620
01:44:55.270 --> 01:44:55.391
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

3621
01:44:55.391 --> 01:44:56.110
<v Speaker 8>but I'm serious.</v>

3622
01:44:56.110 --> 01:44:56.290
<v Speaker 8>I'm</v>

3623
01:44:56.290 --> 01:44:57.320
<v Speaker 3>proud of my dad about,</v>

3624
01:44:57.380 --> 01:44:57.730
<v Speaker 3>honestly,</v>

3625
01:44:57.730 --> 01:44:58.960
<v Speaker 3>because I'm a very old dad.</v>

3626
01:44:59.260 --> 01:45:00.610
<v Speaker 3>My Dad's super fucking old.</v>

3627
01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:01.533
<v Speaker 3>How old is he now?</v>

3628
01:45:02.260 --> 01:45:02.890
<v Speaker 3>80.</v>

3629
01:45:02.890 --> 01:45:03.670
<v Speaker 3>Nope,</v>

3630
01:45:03.670 --> 01:45:04.450
<v Speaker 3>a thousand.</v>

3631
01:45:04.450 --> 01:45:05.283
<v Speaker 3>Almost</v>

3632
01:45:07.150 --> 01:45:07.660
<v Speaker 3>92.</v>

3633
01:45:07.660 --> 01:45:08.493
<v Speaker 3>93.</v>

3634
01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:09.453
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

3635
01:45:09.720 --> 01:45:11.020
<v Speaker 3>And he's doing well.</v>

3636
01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:12.700
<v Speaker 3>He just broke his hip,</v>

3637
01:45:13.510 --> 01:45:14.171
<v Speaker 3>but he's okay.</v>

3638
01:45:14.171 --> 01:45:14.981
<v Speaker 3>He's doing great man.</v>

3639
01:45:14.981 --> 01:45:16.040
<v Speaker 3>Cause he's keeping his,</v>

3640
01:45:16.060 --> 01:45:16.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3641
01:45:16.290 --> 01:45:16.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3642
01:45:16.420 --> 01:45:17.290
<v Speaker 3>seriously.</v>

3643
01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:19.150
<v Speaker 3>He has all the way there.</v>

3644
01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:20.013
<v Speaker 3>He's with you.</v>

3645
01:45:20.020 --> 01:45:20.591
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

3646
01:45:20.591 --> 01:45:21.730
<v Speaker 3>And he's keeping the attitude.</v>

3647
01:45:21.731 --> 01:45:23.560
<v Speaker 3>He recognizes that if he gets depressed,</v>

3648
01:45:23.561 --> 01:45:24.820
<v Speaker 3>which is totally reasonable,</v>

3649
01:45:25.060 --> 01:45:26.200
<v Speaker 3>the fact that if he falls down,</v>

3650
01:45:26.201 --> 01:45:27.034
<v Speaker 3>which is what happened,</v>

3651
01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:28.480
<v Speaker 3>he tripped,</v>

3652
01:45:28.481 --> 01:45:32.950
<v Speaker 3>fell down to fucking broke the ball off of his hip just by falling down.</v>

3653
01:45:32.980 --> 01:45:34.330
<v Speaker 3>His bones are that brittle.</v>

3654
01:45:34.540 --> 01:45:35.140
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

3655
01:45:35.140 --> 01:45:39.130
<v Speaker 3>But he knows that if he accepts that as,</v>

3656
01:45:39.580 --> 01:45:39.970
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

3657
01:45:39.970 --> 01:45:40.840
<v Speaker 3>a serious of things,</v>

3658
01:45:40.841 --> 01:45:41.830
<v Speaker 3>as some people might,</v>

3659
01:45:42.010 --> 01:45:42.730
<v Speaker 3>he's done.</v>

3660
01:45:42.730 --> 01:45:43.630
<v Speaker 3>He's literally done.</v>

3661
01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:44.650
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3662
01:45:44.650 --> 01:45:45.460
<v Speaker 3>so he's with it,</v>

3663
01:45:45.460 --> 01:45:46.030
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3664
01:45:46.030 --> 01:45:46.460
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3665
01:45:46.460 --> 01:45:47.291
<v Speaker 3>He's positive.</v>

3666
01:45:47.291 --> 01:45:48.124
<v Speaker 3>He's feeling good.</v>

3667
01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:50.020
<v Speaker 3>That's our all of our future.</v>

3668
01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:50.411
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3669
01:45:50.411 --> 01:45:54.310
<v Speaker 3>we're all going to be 93 if we don't get hit in the head by a fucking media or</v>

3670
01:45:54.550 --> 01:45:57.070
<v Speaker 3>if those jets don't mean business because it could be it.</v>

3671
01:45:57.071 --> 01:45:58.030
<v Speaker 3>This could be the last day.</v>

3672
01:45:58.900 --> 01:45:59.733
<v Speaker 3>I would've enjoyed it.</v>

3673
01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:05.040
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the big problems with being a person is that we all have the</v>

3674
01:46:05.561 --> 01:46:07.180
<v Speaker 3>ability to understand that are finite.</v>

3675
01:46:07.810 --> 01:46:08.643
<v Speaker 3>We all know it,</v>

3676
01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:09.730
<v Speaker 3>we rationalize it,</v>

3677
01:46:09.731 --> 01:46:10.570
<v Speaker 3>we have in our head,</v>

3678
01:46:10.930 --> 01:46:14.920
<v Speaker 3>but it never sort of reaches our immediate consciousness.</v>

3679
01:46:14.921 --> 01:46:16.850
<v Speaker 3>It always sort of sits in the periphery,</v>

3680
01:46:16.851 --> 01:46:19.330
<v Speaker 3>is some future possibility.</v>

3681
01:46:19.390 --> 01:46:19.511
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3682
01:46:19.511 --> 01:46:20.970
<v Speaker 3>you know what I think is the,</v>

3683
01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:26.000
<v Speaker 3>the trickling down of that mindset is us looking at our times as specific as</v>

3684
01:46:27.581 --> 01:46:32.581
<v Speaker 3>unique in terms of how desperate things are or how close we are to the edge of</v>

3685
01:46:32.591 --> 01:46:33.300
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

3686
01:46:33.300 --> 01:46:33.800
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3687
01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:34.633
<v Speaker 3>the idea that like,</v>

3688
01:46:34.750 --> 01:46:34.961
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3689
01:46:34.961 --> 01:46:35.500
<v Speaker 3>we're at the,</v>

3690
01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:36.250
<v Speaker 3>this is it.</v>

3691
01:46:36.250 --> 01:46:36.581
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3692
01:46:36.581 --> 01:46:38.440
<v Speaker 3>they all look at all this chaos in the world.</v>

3693
01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:40.090
<v Speaker 3>I think it's always been like that,</v>

3694
01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:43.030
<v Speaker 3>but our way of communicating with mortality is saying no,</v>

3695
01:46:43.031 --> 01:46:44.290
<v Speaker 3>this time is unique.</v>

3696
01:46:45.610 --> 01:46:45.941
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3697
01:46:45.941 --> 01:46:47.320
<v Speaker 3>this time is unique though.</v>

3698
01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:50.070
<v Speaker 3>Well of course it's unique in the sense that events that are happening now,</v>

3699
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:51.230
<v Speaker 2>I've never happened before that.</v>

3700
01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:54.980
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the number one draw of and I mean it's nice to be nostalgist and</v>

3701
01:46:55.260 --> 01:46:57.480
<v Speaker 2>nostalgic and look at it in like in,</v>

3702
01:46:57.481 --> 01:46:57.781
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

3703
01:46:57.781 --> 01:47:02.781
<v Speaker 2>in relationship to the Times that we're unique in the 70s and the 60s and the</v>

3704
01:47:03.241 --> 01:47:08.241
<v Speaker 2>forties there every time has been the pinnacle of human interactions at this</v>

3705
01:47:09.571 --> 01:47:09.931
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>

3706
01:47:09.931 --> 01:47:14.931
<v Speaker 2>Right now at 2014 we are at the front of the line of what it is to be a person</v>

3707
01:47:15.270 --> 01:47:16.140
<v Speaker 2>and we really are.</v>

3708
01:47:16.180 --> 01:47:17.070
<v Speaker 2>We were at the front,</v>

3709
01:47:17.670 --> 01:47:21.280
<v Speaker 2>we're at the front with phones or the front with social media or the front with</v>

3710
01:47:21.950 --> 01:47:22.650
<v Speaker 2>with this,</v>

3711
01:47:22.650 --> 01:47:23.060
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3712
01:47:23.060 --> 01:47:23.390
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3713
01:47:23.390 --> 01:47:25.620
<v Speaker 2>this is fucking crazy podcast.</v>

3714
01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:26.700
<v Speaker 2>What we're doing right now.</v>

3715
01:47:26.730 --> 01:47:27.121
<v Speaker 2>These the,</v>

3716
01:47:27.121 --> 01:47:30.540
<v Speaker 2>the ability to talk to people like do you really be Ben?</v>

3717
01:47:30.541 --> 01:47:31.620
<v Speaker 2>You really be Suzanne.</v>

01:47:31.621 --> 01:47:32.580
<v Speaker 2>Be really be me,</v>

3719
01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:33.653
<v Speaker 2>Brian.</v>

3720
01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:35.730
<v Speaker 2>Brian is sort of him,</v>

3721
01:47:35.850 --> 01:47:39.890
<v Speaker 5>but even he is confused as to what the fuck is going on.</v>

3722
01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:41.370
<v Speaker 5>Why you look fucking amazing.</v>

3723
01:47:42.510 --> 01:47:43.490
<v Speaker 5>We just learned that Brian's,</v>

3724
01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:46.390
<v Speaker 5>he's a sexy bitch skin,</v>

3725
01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:48.830
<v Speaker 5>like a newborn stash hair.</v>

3726
01:47:49.130 --> 01:47:50.800
<v Speaker 5>Even the weight of it's got to cook woman.</v>

3727
01:47:50.810 --> 01:47:53.420
<v Speaker 5>His life should go to dinner.</v>

3728
01:47:53.450 --> 01:47:54.283
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't have a job.</v>

3729
01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:56.060
<v Speaker 5>I have a show after this.</v>

3730
01:47:56.061 --> 01:47:59.420
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing the Ice House in Pasadena and then I'm doing the Improv.</v>

3731
01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:01.420
<v Speaker 5>Does this mean we're not hanging out after work?</v>

3732
01:48:01.421 --> 01:48:05.150
<v Speaker 5>And I know we just gotta get my 22nd what you just said,</v>

3741
01:48:13.900 --> 01:48:14.820
<v Speaker 5>we're speaking in,</v>

3742
01:48:14.850 --> 01:48:17.390
<v Speaker 5>in our truth in our own way.</v>

3743
01:48:17.540 --> 01:48:18.260
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3744
01:48:18.260 --> 01:48:21.020
<v Speaker 5>That gives me hope because you know,</v>

3745
01:48:21.021 --> 01:48:24.380
<v Speaker 5>all of the sort of like sanitize media and the things that you are,</v>

3746
01:48:24.650 --> 01:48:25.250
<v Speaker 5>are,</v>

3747
01:48:25.250 --> 01:48:25.760
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3748
01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:30.050
<v Speaker 5>given on a regular basis and the information that's coming through.</v>

3749
01:48:30.050 --> 01:48:31.040
<v Speaker 5>I'm always doubtful.</v>

3750
01:48:31.041 --> 01:48:35.630
<v Speaker 5>I'm always weary and nervous and doubt,</v>

3751
01:48:35.660 --> 01:48:36.050
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3752
01:48:36.050 --> 01:48:37.100
<v Speaker 5>I just don't believe it.</v>

3753
01:48:37.190 --> 01:48:37.520
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3754
01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:37.791
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3755
01:48:37.791 --> 01:48:40.190
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure there's some actual,</v>

3756
01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:41.360
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3757
01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:42.320
<v Speaker 5>reality to it,</v>

3758
01:48:42.350 --> 01:48:47.350
<v Speaker 5>but I think there's always an agenda with major media market and whatever.</v>

3759
01:48:48.010 --> 01:48:49.370
<v Speaker 5>We were talking about different things here.</v>

3760
01:48:49.430 --> 01:48:49.550
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3761
01:48:49.550 --> 01:48:49.780
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3762
01:48:49.780 --> 01:48:50.613
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3763
01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:50.890
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3764
01:48:50.890 --> 01:48:51.080
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3765
01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:51.231
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3766
01:48:51.231 --> 01:48:51.411
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3767
01:48:51.411 --> 01:48:51.591
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3768
01:48:51.591 --> 01:48:51.831
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3769
01:48:51.831 --> 01:48:51.981
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

3770
01:48:51.981 --> 01:48:52.790
<v Speaker 5>But as far as,</v>

3771
01:48:52.790 --> 01:48:53.240
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3772
01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:54.073
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3773
01:48:54.110 --> 01:48:57.650
<v Speaker 5>you were talking about like the current state of our mortality and,</v>

3774
01:48:57.651 --> 01:48:58.700
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

3775
01:48:58.730 --> 01:48:59.180
<v Speaker 5>our,</v>

3776
01:48:59.180 --> 01:49:00.710
<v Speaker 5>our visual of like,</v>

3777
01:49:00.740 --> 01:49:00.921
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>

3778
01:49:00.921 --> 01:49:01.880
<v Speaker 5>it's really bad.</v>

3779
01:49:01.910 --> 01:49:03.020
<v Speaker 5>Or it's how it,</v>

3780
01:49:03.110 --> 01:49:03.830
<v Speaker 5>how it is.</v>

3781
01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:04.910
<v Speaker 5>I think that,</v>

3782
01:49:04.940 --> 01:49:05.773
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3783
01:49:06.500 --> 01:49:07.333
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3784
01:49:07.460 --> 01:49:12.460
<v Speaker 5>the way that we perceive the world now you have options and options like</v>

3785
01:49:13.940 --> 01:49:18.940
<v Speaker 5>podcasts or are really learning about someone else's viewpoint from there,</v>

3786
01:49:20.930 --> 01:49:22.760
<v Speaker 5>like right out of the horse's mouth.</v>

3787
01:49:23.090 --> 01:49:23.500
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3788
01:49:23.500 --> 01:49:25.580
<v Speaker 5>on a podcast that's not funded by,</v>

3789
01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:26.211
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3790
01:49:26.211 --> 01:49:28.670
<v Speaker 5>a major oil company or something,</v>

3791
01:49:28.700 --> 01:49:29.533
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

3792
01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:30.000
<v Speaker 5>That,</v>

3793
01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.860
<v Speaker 5>that's where I feel a little more comfort and I'm,</v>

3794
01:49:33.050 --> 01:49:34.070
<v Speaker 5>am I confusing anybody?</v>

3795
01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:34.953
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3796
01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:35.230
<v Speaker 5>We're</v>

3797
01:49:35.230 --> 01:49:36.190
<v Speaker 2>having this conversation.</v>

3798
01:49:36.191 --> 01:49:40.150
<v Speaker 2>We're friends and it doesn't matter if we're doing a different thing that we</v>

3799
01:49:40.151 --> 01:49:42.760
<v Speaker 2>would be doing if we were just hanging out because we know that people are</v>

3800
01:49:42.761 --> 01:49:43.480
<v Speaker 2>listening.</v>

3801
01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:46.000
<v Speaker 2>So we're doing this different thing where we're trying to be like really clear.</v>

3802
01:49:46.001 --> 01:49:46.450
<v Speaker 2>We're trying not,</v>

3803
01:49:46.450 --> 01:49:49.110
<v Speaker 2>you're doing a great with much try not to talk over Suzanne,</v>

3804
01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:51.621
<v Speaker 2>just not get it.</v>

3805
01:49:51.621 --> 01:49:52.454
<v Speaker 2>That it's okay.</v>

3806
01:49:54.300 --> 01:49:58.210
<v Speaker 2>But what we're doing is there's no other influences of the nos.</v>

3807
01:49:58.211 --> 01:49:59.021
<v Speaker 2>We know what we're doing.</v>

3808
01:49:59.021 --> 01:50:00.220
<v Speaker 2>We w we have this idea that,</v>

3809
01:50:00.221 --> 01:50:00.401
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3810
01:50:00.401 --> 01:50:00.580
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

3811
01:50:00.580 --> 01:50:03.280
<v Speaker 2>we're putting out something that people are going to receive and it's going to</v>

3812
01:50:03.281 --> 01:50:04.114
<v Speaker 2>be entertaining.</v>

3813
01:50:04.910 --> 01:50:06.850
<v Speaker 2>And we have our binder biases.</v>

3814
01:50:06.851 --> 01:50:07.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3815
01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:08.171
<v Speaker 2>we are,</v>

3816
01:50:08.171 --> 01:50:09.004
<v Speaker 2>we're in a band.</v>

3817
01:50:10.010 --> 01:50:11.230
<v Speaker 2>We'd signed a record deal.</v>

3818
01:50:11.231 --> 01:50:11.981
<v Speaker 2>I was shit,</v>

3819
01:50:11.981 --> 01:50:12.814
<v Speaker 2>but we're not,</v>

3820
01:50:12.970 --> 01:50:13.870
<v Speaker 2>I understand what you're saying.</v>

3821
01:50:13.871 --> 01:50:15.670
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm just trying to be super literal as Tom.</v>

3822
01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:16.110
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

3823
01:50:16.110 --> 01:50:16.640
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3824
01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:17.230
<v Speaker 2>even think it's not,</v>

3825
01:50:17.230 --> 01:50:17.590
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

3826
01:50:17.590 --> 01:50:18.100
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3827
01:50:18.100 --> 01:50:19.330
<v Speaker 2>we do this all the time.</v>

3828
01:50:19.390 --> 01:50:22.390
<v Speaker 2>So it's a weird form of expression,</v>

3829
01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:22.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3830
01:50:22.870 --> 01:50:24.540
<v Speaker 2>It's weird form of expression when you,</v>

3831
01:50:24.590 --> 01:50:25.301
<v Speaker 2>you're talking,</v>

3832
01:50:25.301 --> 01:50:26.680
<v Speaker 2>but you also know that people are listening,</v>

3833
01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:27.650
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3834
01:50:27.650 --> 01:50:28.483
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3835
01:50:28.750 --> 01:50:33.750
<v Speaker 2>but the beautiful thing is there's no interruptions and no one is telling you</v>

3836
01:50:34.961 --> 01:50:35.620
<v Speaker 2>yes or no.</v>

3837
01:50:35.620 --> 01:50:38.020
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no publicist is standing over your shoulder saying,</v>

3838
01:50:38.021 --> 01:50:39.160
<v Speaker 2>this is bad for your career.</v>

3839
01:50:39.310 --> 01:50:41.080
<v Speaker 2>There's no go bean counter.</v>

3840
01:50:41.081 --> 01:50:41.741
<v Speaker 2>Who's saying,</v>

3841
01:50:41.741 --> 01:50:42.131
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

3842
01:50:42.131 --> 01:50:42.431
<v Speaker 2>Ben,</v>

3843
01:50:42.431 --> 01:50:45.700
<v Speaker 2>if you admit to gay thoughts and wanting to kiss Brian Redman,</v>

3844
01:50:45.701 --> 01:50:48.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm the mouth because it was beautiful mustache.</v>

3845
01:50:49.330 --> 01:50:51.610
<v Speaker 2>This is going to cost us 14 records,</v>

3846
01:50:51.700 --> 01:50:54.970
<v Speaker 2>an hour worth it worth every penny.</v>

3847
01:50:57.580 --> 01:51:00.460
<v Speaker 2>They might fucking break and see that as a bad thing.</v>

3848
01:51:01.570 --> 01:51:02.420
<v Speaker 2>14 people are.</v>

3849
01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:03.940
<v Speaker 2>Cons is no free lunch.</v>

3850
01:51:04.030 --> 01:51:05.530
<v Speaker 2>Fucking shitty.</v>

3851
01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:07.990
<v Speaker 2>Let me express my love.</v>

3852
01:51:07.991 --> 01:51:11.410
<v Speaker 2>Never losing my country charm or my fucking fanny pack.</v>

3853
01:51:11.411 --> 01:51:13.630
<v Speaker 2>Both of those things stay to the,</v>

3854
01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:14.913
<v Speaker 2>to the grave.</v>

3855
01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:15.760
<v Speaker 2>You have a fanny pack,</v>

3856
01:51:15.761 --> 01:51:16.030
<v Speaker 2>chuck.</v>

3857
01:51:16.030 --> 01:51:16.900
<v Speaker 2>Do I sell them?</v>

3858
01:51:16.901 --> 01:51:17.734
<v Speaker 2>Yes I do.</v>

3859
01:51:18.070 --> 01:51:19.450
<v Speaker 2>If I run out of them.</v>

3860
01:51:19.451 --> 01:51:20.284
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3861

<v Speaker 2>this is my buddy.</v>

3864
01:51:23.501 --> 01:51:26.080
<v Speaker 2>This is just no interest in this business.</v>

3865
01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:28.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean other than the friendship interest,</v>

3866
01:51:28.980 --> 01:51:29.621
<v Speaker 2>no financial.</v>

3867
01:51:29.621 --> 01:51:31.870
<v Speaker 2>We talked last time about bulletproof coffee.</v>

01:51:32.380 --> 01:51:34.840
<v Speaker 2>Caveman coffee is my friend Tate.</v>

3873
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:42.701
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

3874
01:51:42.701 --> 01:51:43.570
<v Speaker 2>I want to say Columbia,</v>

3875
01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:44.500
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

3876
01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:46.210
<v Speaker 2>it's just the fucking salt of the earth.</v>

3877

01:56:11.670 --> 01:56:12.503
<v Speaker 4>Scared</v>

4022
01:56:14.290 --> 01:56:15.130
<v Speaker 4>needs pills.</v>

4023
01:56:16.410 --> 01:56:20.460
<v Speaker 4>Could you imagine if you move to Mars and you found a fucking sign you were</v>

4024
01:56:20.461 --> 01:56:21.001
<v Speaker 4>digging,</v>

4025
01:56:21.001 --> 01:56:22.290
<v Speaker 4>like trying to plant tomatoes.</v>

4026
01:56:22.410 --> 01:56:23.790
<v Speaker 4>I think sign that said,</v>

4027
01:56:23.791 --> 01:56:25.640
<v Speaker 4>get the fuck out of here quick.</v>

4028
01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:31.200
<v Speaker 4>Do you guys remember that with ice cube and it was about like Mars.</v>

4029
01:56:31.350 --> 01:56:31.681
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>

4030
01:56:31.681 --> 01:56:32.514
<v Speaker 4>What was it called?</v>

4031
01:56:33.390 --> 01:56:34.223
<v Speaker 4>Friday</v>

4032
01:56:35.910 --> 01:56:36.870
<v Speaker 4>and people die.</v>

4033
01:56:37.030 --> 01:56:37.701
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4034
01:56:37.701 --> 01:56:39.090
<v Speaker 4>it was a John Carpenter movie.</v>

4035
01:56:39.150 --> 01:56:40.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4036
01:56:40.201 --> 01:56:40.860
<v Speaker 4>I remember that.</v>

4037
01:56:40.860 --> 01:56:43.890
<v Speaker 4>I remember seeing that when I was young teenager.</v>

4038
01:56:43.950 --> 01:56:44.251
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

4039
01:56:44.251 --> 01:56:45.790
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember too much about that,</v>

4040
01:56:45.791 --> 01:56:49.470
<v Speaker 4>but there's some Mars movie kind of like a Zombie.</v>

4041
01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:50.790
<v Speaker 4>It feel to it.</v>

4042
01:56:52.390 --> 01:56:53.223
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4043
01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:54.900
<v Speaker 4>the idea of Mars,</v>

4044
01:56:55.020 --> 01:56:55.561
<v Speaker 4>to me,</v>

4045
01:56:55.561 --> 01:56:58.500
<v Speaker 4>it's like living in the shittiest neighborhood of all time.</v>

4046
01:56:58.860 --> 01:56:59.970
<v Speaker 4>There's no plants,</v>

4047
01:57:00.090 --> 01:57:01.680
<v Speaker 4>there's no la air quality.</v>

4048
01:57:01.681 --> 01:57:03.900
<v Speaker 4>Can't go outside and even breathe the air.</v>

4049
01:57:03.930 --> 01:57:05.710
<v Speaker 4>You relying on human inventions</v>

4050
01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:07.560
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>

4051
01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:08.430
<v Speaker 4>how about the rest of your life,</v>

4052
01:57:08.431 --> 01:57:09.264
<v Speaker 4>bitch,</v>

4053
01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:11.353
<v Speaker 4>not you.</v>

4054
01:57:11.850 --> 01:57:12.510
<v Speaker 4>The person,</v>

4055
01:57:12.510 --> 01:57:13.560
<v Speaker 4>the person on the,</v>

4056
01:57:13.710 --> 01:57:16.500
<v Speaker 4>on the island of Mars itself.</v>

4057
01:57:17.580 --> 01:57:20.310
<v Speaker 4>You know the really scary thing about Mars is when they keep finding all this</v>

4058
01:57:20.311 --> 01:57:21.144
<v Speaker 4>water on it,</v>

4059
01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:25.560
<v Speaker 4>they keep finding all these like former rivers and former lakes and it makes</v>

4060
01:57:25.561 --> 01:57:25.720
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

4061
01:57:25.720 --> 01:57:30.720
<v Speaker 4>it really cemented in your head that like earth could be just like that one day.</v>

4062
01:57:32.910 --> 01:57:33.121
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

4063
01:57:33.121 --> 01:57:36.150
<v Speaker 4>we could get hit with not like what killed all the dinosaurs,</v>

4064
01:57:36.330 --> 01:57:37.950
<v Speaker 4>but something fucking crazier.</v>

4065
01:57:38.140 --> 01:57:41.430
<v Speaker 4>You can get hit with some instead of five miles wide.</v>

4066
01:57:41.650 --> 01:57:41.940
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4067
01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:42.151
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4068
01:57:42.151 --> 01:57:42.984
<v Speaker 4>that can happen.</v>

4069
01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:47.070
<v Speaker 4>Hyper Novas like in a nearby galaxy just cooks everything.</v>

4070
01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:52.400
<v Speaker 4>And some sometimes asteroidal impacts planets collide and the fucking entire</v>

4071
01:57:53.341 --> 01:57:54.990
<v Speaker 4>atmosphere of the planet changes.</v>

4072
01:57:55.110 --> 01:57:57.030
<v Speaker 4>That's not just common.</v>

4073
01:57:57.330 --> 01:57:59.730
<v Speaker 4>It's the standard every fucking planet.</v>

4074
01:57:59.731 --> 01:58:00.810
<v Speaker 4>If you look at the moon,</v>

4075
01:58:00.811 --> 01:58:01.644
<v Speaker 4>if you look at Earth,</v>

4076
01:58:01.930 --> 01:58:03.540
<v Speaker 4>everything is littered with,</v>

4077
01:58:03.730 --> 01:58:04.410
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah.</v>

4078
01:58:04.410 --> 01:58:09.410
<v Speaker 4>Impacts every planet we've are found littered with astro people actually robots.</v>

4079
01:58:10.920 --> 01:58:12.130
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that uh,</v>

4080
01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:17.520
<v Speaker 4>we have the technological capacity to prevent that kind of thing cause cause</v>

4081
01:58:18.751 --> 01:58:22.680
<v Speaker 4>we'd know it was coming at this point or at least there's a good chance of it.</v>

4082
01:58:23.250 --> 01:58:24.083
<v Speaker 4>This is what I think.</v>

4083
01:58:24.330 --> 01:58:29.160
<v Speaker 4>Tell me everything other than what is absolutely positive that we can do,</v>

4084
01:58:29.161 --> 01:58:30.390
<v Speaker 4>whether it's air travel,</v>

4085
01:58:30.391 --> 01:58:32.250
<v Speaker 4>whether it's a travel into space,</v>

4086
01:58:32.251 --> 01:58:35.010
<v Speaker 4>space stations is essentially theoretical.</v>

4087
01:58:35.370 --> 01:58:35.850
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

4088
01:58:35.850 --> 01:58:36.690
<v Speaker 4>Unless we've done it,</v>

4089
01:58:36.810 --> 01:58:38.130
<v Speaker 4>they don't know we can do it.</v>

4090
01:58:38.430 --> 01:58:40.950
<v Speaker 4>They assume that we can get away with going to Mars,</v>

4091
01:58:41.260 --> 01:58:42.040
<v Speaker 4>but it could</v>

4092
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:46.570
<v Speaker 2>very well be that they get out into deep space and they find out that the</v>

4093
01:58:46.571 --> 01:58:48.100
<v Speaker 2>magneto sphere and the,</v>

4094
01:58:48.101 --> 01:58:48.271
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4095
01:58:48.271 --> 01:58:48.441
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4096
01:58:48.441 --> 01:58:49.181
<v Speaker 2>the fucking,</v>

4097
01:58:49.181 --> 01:58:53.050
<v Speaker 2>the atmosphere of the earth is protecting us his way in ways from like long</v>

4098
01:58:53.051 --> 01:58:55.510
<v Speaker 2>trips that we just don't understand the possible risks,</v>

4099
01:58:55.990 --> 01:58:58.270
<v Speaker 2>especially radiation asteroids,</v>

4100
01:58:58.271 --> 01:58:59.390
<v Speaker 2>micro meteors what?</v>

4101
01:58:59.500 --> 01:58:59.890
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

4102
01:58:59.890 --> 01:59:00.723
<v Speaker 2>You and your hands up.</v>

4103
01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:01.713
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4104
01:59:02.410 --> 01:59:03.190
<v Speaker 2>From honey honey.</v>

4105
01:59:03.190 --> 01:59:04.240
<v Speaker 2>What is the magnetosphere?</v>

4106
01:59:04.850 --> 01:59:05.380
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

4107
01:59:05.380 --> 01:59:06.400
<v Speaker 2>well there's,</v>

4108
01:59:06.430 --> 01:59:07.510
<v Speaker 2>there's a surface.</v>

4109
01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:08.020
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4110
01:59:08.020 --> 01:59:08.711
<v Speaker 2>The of the earth,</v>

4111
01:59:08.711 --> 01:59:09.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4112
01:59:09.010 --> 01:59:09.843
<v Speaker 2>You got your dirt,</v>

4113
01:59:10.040 --> 01:59:11.020
<v Speaker 2>you got your water,</v>

4114
01:59:11.110 --> 01:59:11.261
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4115
01:59:11.261 --> 01:59:12.580
<v Speaker 2>you got you what you can touch.</v>

4116
01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:15.790
<v Speaker 2>And then above it you have various layers of gases.</v>

4117
01:59:15.820 --> 01:59:16.930
<v Speaker 2>You have oxygen,</v>

4118
01:59:16.931 --> 01:59:18.280
<v Speaker 2>you have the magneto sphere,</v>

4119
01:59:18.310 --> 01:59:19.090
<v Speaker 2>you have,</v>

4120
01:59:19.090 --> 01:59:19.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4121
01:59:19.510 --> 01:59:20.390
<v Speaker 2>you have uh,</v>

4122
01:59:20.391 --> 01:59:21.940
<v Speaker 2>an ozone you had,</v>

4123
01:59:21.941 --> 01:59:24.250
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of things that surround the earth.</v>

4124
01:59:25.140 --> 01:59:29.440
<v Speaker 2>Here's one of the layers of the earth made of guy would do a piss poor job of</v>

4125
01:59:29.441 --> 01:59:31.900
<v Speaker 2>describing it because obviously my education is before,</v>

4126
01:59:32.140 --> 01:59:37.030
<v Speaker 2>but essentially what's going on is you have the atmosphere of the planet and it</v>

4127
01:59:37.031 --> 01:59:39.640
<v Speaker 2>goes from say like one inch.</v>

4128
01:59:39.640 --> 01:59:39.881
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4129
01:59:39.881 --> 01:59:41.780
<v Speaker 2>like the touching the ground too,</v>

4130
01:59:41.800 --> 01:59:42.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4131
01:59:42.130 --> 01:59:45.910
<v Speaker 2>x amount of miles up into the sky until we essentially start calling it space.</v>

4132
01:59:46.300 --> 01:59:50.380
<v Speaker 2>And then from there on you have the van Allen radiation belts,</v>

4133
01:59:50.381 --> 01:59:51.550
<v Speaker 2>which engulf the earth,</v>

4134
01:59:51.551 --> 01:59:52.630
<v Speaker 2>these radiation belts,</v>

4135
01:59:52.631 --> 01:59:53.550
<v Speaker 2>which you know,</v>

4136
01:59:53.551 --> 01:59:58.551
<v Speaker 2>or like a doughnut shaped like band of radiation than in circles the earth.</v>

4137
01:59:58.810 --> 02:00:02.740
<v Speaker 2>And then outside of that you have deep space and there's no protection out</v>

4138
02:00:02.741 --> 02:00:02.921
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

4139
02:00:02.921 --> 02:00:03.581
<v Speaker 2>All that other stuff,</v>

4140
02:00:03.581 --> 02:00:04.331
<v Speaker 2>the atmosphere,</v>

4141
02:00:04.331 --> 02:00:09.250
<v Speaker 2>all the other stuff protects us from things like gamma rays from solar flares,</v>

4142
02:00:09.550 --> 02:00:10.410
<v Speaker 2>from um,</v>

4143
02:00:10.520 --> 02:00:14.550
<v Speaker 2>supernovas if like there was some sort of a supernova in a nearby galaxy and</v>

4144
02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:18.850
<v Speaker 2>gamma rays when flying through the fucking galaxy stuff that's unique to earth</v>

4145
02:00:18.851 --> 02:00:20.860
<v Speaker 2>or to no planets in general,</v>

4146
02:00:20.950 --> 02:00:25.950
<v Speaker 2>neither the atmospheres we know for a fact is atmosphere is in many planets and</v>

4147
02:00:26.831 --> 02:00:30.160
<v Speaker 2>many different solar systems that we found throughout the universe,</v>

4148
02:00:30.340 --> 02:00:32.440
<v Speaker 2>including binary Solon systems,</v>

4149
02:00:32.441 --> 02:00:34.090
<v Speaker 2>which means they have two different stars.</v>

4150
02:00:34.090 --> 02:00:34.571
<v Speaker 2>And then there's,</v>

4151
02:00:34.571 --> 02:00:36.520
<v Speaker 2>we've also detected simple gasses,</v>

4152
02:00:36.521 --> 02:00:39.520
<v Speaker 2>like different gases that that exists on earth,</v>

4153
02:00:39.521 --> 02:00:41.380
<v Speaker 2>whether it's hydrogen or oxygen.</v>

4154
02:00:41.560 --> 02:00:41.741
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

4155
02:00:41.741 --> 02:00:43.600
<v Speaker 2>they've detected those on a lot of planets.</v>

4156
02:00:43.601 --> 02:00:43.870
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

4157
02:00:43.870 --> 02:00:46.540
<v Speaker 2>It was just a dick a decade ago when they didn't know how many planets there</v>

4158
02:00:46.541 --> 02:00:47.081
<v Speaker 2>were out there.</v>

4159
02:00:47.081 --> 02:00:47.914
<v Speaker 2>It was just guessing,</v>

4160
02:00:48.160 --> 02:00:50.140
<v Speaker 2>but now they're just spotting them left and right and they,</v>

4161
02:00:50.590 --> 02:00:50.951
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it,</v>

4162
02:00:50.951 --> 02:00:55.750
<v Speaker 2>they spot the star and then they see the wobble of the star and they recognize</v>

4163
02:00:55.751 --> 02:01:00.070
<v Speaker 2>that something is spinning around the star and that's something most likely as a</v>

4164
02:01:00.071 --> 02:01:00.581
<v Speaker 2>planet.</v>

4165
02:01:00.581 --> 02:01:04.450
<v Speaker 2>And then they can determine the mass of the planet and then they can zoom in on</v>

4166
02:01:04.451 --> 02:01:09.451
<v Speaker 2>that spot and find out if it's got hydrogen or oxygen or whatever the fuck is on</v>

4167
02:01:10.121 --> 02:01:10.954
<v Speaker 2>that plan.</v>

4168
02:01:11.050 --> 02:01:16.050
<v Speaker 2>The likelihood that there are other planets like ours and there it's 100% it's</v>

4169
02:01:18.010 --> 02:01:19.420
<v Speaker 2>this is what's really fucked up.</v>

4170
02:01:19.480 --> 02:01:24.040
<v Speaker 2>It's not only is there most likely other planets like us,</v>

4171
02:01:24.190 --> 02:01:26.680
<v Speaker 2>but from the way it's been explained to me,</v>

4172
02:01:26.890 --> 02:01:31.890
<v Speaker 2>the universe is so big that if infinity is real and there's no reason to believe</v>

4173
02:01:32.531 --> 02:01:33.910
<v Speaker 2>that it's not wood.</v>

4174
02:01:33.911 --> 02:01:36.760
<v Speaker 2>Infinity means if the universe truly has no boundaries,</v>

4175
02:01:36.761 --> 02:01:39.710
<v Speaker 2>and if there's infinite numbers of universes like the same,</v>

4176
02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:43.010
<v Speaker 2>the same idea exist an infinite number of times,</v>

4177
02:01:43.011 --> 02:01:44.180
<v Speaker 2>like an unmeasurable,</v>

4178
02:01:44.181 --> 02:01:48.920
<v Speaker 2>impossible number that there's another Suzanne and other Ben out there sitting</v>

4179
02:01:48.950 --> 02:01:52.610
<v Speaker 2>on these shitty office Max Leather chairs,</v>

4180
02:01:54.060 --> 02:01:54.893
<v Speaker 2>comfy</v>

4181
02:01:57.800 --> 02:01:59.150
<v Speaker 2>nipple rings in a Dick.</v>

4182
02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:02.860
<v Speaker 2>Why not just switch it up?</v>

4183
02:02:02.880 --> 02:02:03.561
<v Speaker 2>Guarantee you.</v>

4184
02:02:03.561 --> 02:02:07.210
<v Speaker 2>There's another Suzanne out there with a deck that has eyeballs and it's like</v>

4185
02:02:07.700 --> 02:02:08.211
<v Speaker 2>big Dick.</v>

4186
02:02:08.211 --> 02:02:11.570
<v Speaker 2>Every possibility that you could think of exists.</v>

4187
02:02:11.930 --> 02:02:14.570
<v Speaker 2>This is what's really fucked up about the concept of infinity.</v>

4188
02:02:15.050 --> 02:02:17.420
<v Speaker 2>Infinity literally means there's no boundaries,</v>

4189
02:02:17.421 --> 02:02:18.260
<v Speaker 2>there's no end.</v>

4190
02:02:18.500 --> 02:02:20.930
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like you get to a certain amount of time.</v>

4191
02:02:20.931 --> 02:02:23.120
<v Speaker 2>The raw carbon building blocks for life.</v>

4192
02:02:23.121 --> 02:02:23.751
<v Speaker 2>We've run out,</v>

4193
02:02:23.751 --> 02:02:27.260
<v Speaker 2>we've made all the giraffes and the fucking cactuses and the palm trees.</v>

4194
02:02:27.410 --> 02:02:31.310
<v Speaker 2>We don't have any room for us who's hand with a giant Dick and incorrect.</v>

4195
02:02:31.490 --> 02:02:35.540
<v Speaker 2>We have another fucking infinite number of universes with infinite solar</v>

4196
02:02:35.541 --> 02:02:36.374
<v Speaker 2>systems,</v>

4197
02:02:36.470 --> 02:02:37.730
<v Speaker 2>infinite galaxies,</v>

4198
02:02:37.731 --> 02:02:41.300
<v Speaker 2>and inside one of those somewhere a billion,</v>

4199
02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:42.980
<v Speaker 2>trillion fucking zillion miles away.</v>

4200
02:02:43.160 --> 02:02:44.240
<v Speaker 2>There's another Suzanne.</v>

4201
02:02:44.300 --> 02:02:46.190
<v Speaker 2>But this is coming from a point of complete,</v>

4202
02:02:46.490 --> 02:02:47.031
<v Speaker 2>not complete,</v>

4203
02:02:47.031 --> 02:02:47.541
<v Speaker 2>but like a,</v>

4204
02:02:47.541 --> 02:02:49.220
<v Speaker 2>a decent amount of ignorance,</v>

4205
02:02:49.580 --> 02:02:52.970
<v Speaker 2>but what can you get to speak English?</v>

4206
02:02:52.980 --> 02:02:57.980
<v Speaker 2>So I was under the impression that there's still the understanding that the</v>

4207
02:02:58.461 --> 02:03:01.250
<v Speaker 2>universe is contracting Doosan degree,</v>

4208
02:03:01.970 --> 02:03:05.180
<v Speaker 2>what's supposed to be currently expanding but will eventually contract.</v>

4209
02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:05.421
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

4210
02:03:05.421 --> 02:03:06.254
<v Speaker 2>but that speaks to,</v>

4211
02:03:06.500 --> 02:03:07.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4212
02:03:07.910 --> 02:03:08.750
<v Speaker 2>perimeters.</v>

4213
02:03:09.290 --> 02:03:09.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4214
02:03:09.620 --> 02:03:12.620
<v Speaker 2>the problem is when you talk about this kind of stuff,</v>

4215
02:03:12.650 --> 02:03:15.830
<v Speaker 2>especially if it's a guy like you who's a musician or a gog means an idiot.</v>

4216
02:03:15.860 --> 02:03:16.281
<v Speaker 2>We're really,</v>

4217
02:03:16.281 --> 02:03:17.114
<v Speaker 2>we don't know what,</v>

4218
02:03:17.930 --> 02:03:19.160
<v Speaker 2>we don't know what the fuck you're saying.</v>

4219
02:03:19.460 --> 02:03:22.640
<v Speaker 2>So we're just basically parroting what we've heard.</v>

4220
02:03:22.641 --> 02:03:23.590
<v Speaker 2>Like legitimates,</v>

4221
02:03:24.450 --> 02:03:24.920
<v Speaker 2>degrass,</v>

4222
02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:25.431
<v Speaker 2>Tyson,</v>

4223
02:03:25.431 --> 02:03:26.360
<v Speaker 2>Michio Kaku,</v>

4224
02:03:26.361 --> 02:03:31.361
<v Speaker 2>astrophysicist type dudes actually like do the calculations and figure it out.</v>

4225
02:03:31.551 --> 02:03:32.211
<v Speaker 2>And I think that,</v>

4226
02:03:32.211 --> 02:03:33.044
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4227
02:03:33.320 --> 02:03:37.010
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of debate about what we know and what we're sure of.</v>

4228
02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:39.080
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes those things come into question.</v>

4229
02:03:39.081 --> 02:03:40.340
<v Speaker 2>Like lately there's a guy,</v>

4230
02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:43.910
<v Speaker 2>there's a new guy who is claiming that black holes don't exist.</v>

4231
02:03:44.150 --> 02:03:47.780
<v Speaker 2>And this is like a really recent study that a lot of people are taking very</v>

4232
02:03:47.781 --> 02:03:48.614
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>

4233
02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:52.610
<v Speaker 2>And this guy has said that black holes as we know them do not exist because it's</v>

4234
02:03:52.611 --> 02:03:53.750
<v Speaker 2>kind of showing this room though.</v>

4235
02:03:54.230 --> 02:03:55.010
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>

4236
02:03:55.010 --> 02:03:55.800
<v Speaker 2>Five in this room?</v>

4237
02:03:55.800 --> 02:03:58.190
<v Speaker 2>Five black holes is not black.</v>

4238
02:03:58.310 --> 02:03:59.390
<v Speaker 2>It's not even Brown.</v>

4239
02:03:59.630 --> 02:04:00.590
<v Speaker 2>It's like a red.</v>

4240
02:04:01.980 --> 02:04:03.140
<v Speaker 2>You should get that looked at.</v>

4241
02:04:03.530 --> 02:04:03.971
<v Speaker 2>Here's it.</v>

4242
02:04:03.971 --> 02:04:04.550
<v Speaker 2>Here it is.</v>

4243
02:04:04.550 --> 02:04:05.420
<v Speaker 2>This is the theory.</v>

4244
02:04:05.620 --> 02:04:07.100
<v Speaker 2>Black holes do not exist.</v>

4245
02:04:07.910 --> 02:04:09.530
<v Speaker 2>But think about it like the big bang.</v>

4246
02:04:09.950 --> 02:04:10.783
<v Speaker 2>This did not.</v>

4247
02:04:10.820 --> 02:04:12.920
<v Speaker 2>The big bank did not exist a hundred years ago,</v>

4248
02:04:12.921 --> 02:04:13.581
<v Speaker 2>a hundred years ago,</v>

4249
02:04:13.581 --> 02:04:17.360
<v Speaker 2>and people riding around on horses and fucking doing any Oakley fucking shooting</v>

4250
02:04:17.361 --> 02:04:17.980
<v Speaker 2>galleries with,</v>

4251
02:04:17.980 --> 02:04:18.550
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4252
02:04:18.550 --> 02:04:21.050
<v Speaker 2>like looking at a fucking mirror and shooting over their shoulder.</v>

4253
02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:23.540
<v Speaker 2>It was a greatest thing you could ever do that.</v>

4254
02:04:23.541 --> 02:04:25.100
<v Speaker 2>No one knew what the fuck the big bang was.</v>

4255
02:04:25.130 --> 02:04:27.320
<v Speaker 2>No one had any idea why the stars were in the sky.</v>

4256
02:04:27.530 --> 02:04:28.370
<v Speaker 2>And now we know.</v>

4257
02:04:28.700 --> 02:04:29.600
<v Speaker 2>But this guy,</v>

4258
02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:31.190
<v Speaker 2>this recent guy,</v>

4259
02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:31.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4260
02:04:31.820 --> 02:04:31.911
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

4261
02:04:31.911 --> 02:04:32.660
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

4262
02:04:32.660 --> 02:04:33.493
<v Speaker 2>it's a woman.</v>

4263
02:04:33.800 --> 02:04:34.633
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

4264
02:04:35.540 --> 02:04:39.240
<v Speaker 2>Then of course I'll only wrong would try to take away the bay.</v>

4265
02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:41.130
<v Speaker 2>You fucking bitch.</v>

4266
02:04:41.520 --> 02:04:42.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry ma'am.</v>

4267
02:04:42.600 --> 02:04:43.080
<v Speaker 2>I do it.</v>

4268
02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:43.980
<v Speaker 2>I was only kidding.</v>

4269
02:04:44.130 --> 02:04:44.520
<v Speaker 2>Boy.</v>

4270
02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:44.791
<v Speaker 2>Her,</v>

4271
02:04:44.791 --> 02:04:48.840
<v Speaker 2>her name is professor Laura Mursine.</v>

4272
02:04:49.170 --> 02:04:51.900
<v Speaker 2>H O.</v>

4273
02:04:51.900 --> 02:04:51.900
<v Speaker 2>U.</v>

4274
02:04:51.900 --> 02:04:51.900
<v Speaker 2>G.</v>

4275
02:04:51.900 --> 02:04:51.900
<v Speaker 2>H.</v>

4276
02:04:51.900 --> 02:04:51.900
<v Speaker 2>T.</v>

4277
02:04:51.900 --> 02:04:51.900
<v Speaker 2>O.</v>

4278
02:04:51.900 --> 02:04:51.930
<v Speaker 2>N.</v>

4279
02:04:51.930 --> 02:04:52.850
<v Speaker 2>How can I help tone?</v>

4280
02:04:53.020 --> 02:04:56.670
<v Speaker 2>How often said she is still in shock from the fine.</v>

4281
02:04:56.910 --> 02:04:57.360
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4282
02:04:57.360 --> 02:05:01.380
<v Speaker 2>previously scientists thought the stars were much larger than the sun collapsed</v>

4283
02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:02.580
<v Speaker 2>under a,</v>

4284
02:05:02.700 --> 02:05:06.600
<v Speaker 2>their own sons collapse under their own gravity and formed black holes when they</v>

4285
02:05:06.601 --> 02:05:07.434
<v Speaker 2>died.</v>

4286
02:05:07.530 --> 02:05:12.360
<v Speaker 2>And during this process they release a type of radiation called Hawking</v>

4287
02:05:12.361 --> 02:05:12.901
<v Speaker 2>radiation.</v>

4288
02:05:12.901 --> 02:05:17.580
<v Speaker 2>But new research claims the star would lose too much mass and wouldn't be able</v>

4289
02:05:17.581 --> 02:05:18.690
<v Speaker 2>to form a black hole.</v>

4290
02:05:18.840 --> 02:05:19.950
<v Speaker 2>And if this is true,</v>

4291
02:05:20.100 --> 02:05:24.600
<v Speaker 2>the theory that the universe began as a singularity followed by a big bang could</v>

4292
02:05:24.630 --> 02:05:25.590
<v Speaker 2>also be wrong.</v>

4293
02:05:25.800 --> 02:05:27.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand a word you said,</v>

4294
02:05:30.180 --> 02:05:31.200
<v Speaker 2>it's quite interesting,</v>

4295
02:05:31.230 --> 02:05:35.910
<v Speaker 2>but by the dissolution of historic can't have this ultimately dense,</v>

4296
02:05:36.510 --> 02:05:37.470
<v Speaker 2>ultimately small,</v>

4297
02:05:37.471 --> 02:05:38.304
<v Speaker 2>infinitely dense,</v>

4298
02:05:38.310 --> 02:05:40.020
<v Speaker 2>infinitely small ball of matter,</v>

4299
02:05:40.021 --> 02:05:41.280
<v Speaker 2>which creates the big man.</v>

4300
02:05:42.180 --> 02:05:43.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4301
02:05:43.110 --> 02:05:43.731
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

4302
02:05:43.731 --> 02:05:44.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't like,</v>

4303
02:05:44.540 --> 02:05:47.880
<v Speaker 2>is this where we're dumb and even bothering to have this conversation because I</v>

4304
02:05:47.881 --> 02:05:48.860
<v Speaker 2>think his shit is,</v>

4305
02:05:49.320 --> 02:05:52.410
<v Speaker 2>this is beyond like the great minds of our time.</v>

4306
02:05:52.411 --> 02:05:54.270
<v Speaker 2>This is one of those things where there's no conclusion.</v>

4307
02:05:54.271 --> 02:05:55.104
<v Speaker 2>That's contract.</v>

4308
02:05:58.310 --> 02:05:59.143
<v Speaker 8>Really started it.</v>

4309
02:05:59.760 --> 02:06:00.960
<v Speaker 8>Time to move in.</v>

4310
02:06:00.961 --> 02:06:01.081
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4311
02:06:01.081 --> 02:06:06.081
<v Speaker 8>You guys want to set up the microphones to give her a guitar.</v>

4312
02:06:06.480 --> 02:06:07.111
<v Speaker 8>She wakes up.</v>

4313
02:06:07.111 --> 02:06:08.880
<v Speaker 8>She'll start singing like an angel.</v>

4314
02:06:10.110 --> 02:06:11.550
<v Speaker 8>I was with you the whole time.</v>

4315
02:06:11.560 --> 02:06:12.393
<v Speaker 8>I'm like,</v>

4316
02:06:12.990 --> 02:06:13.530
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

4317
02:06:13.530 --> 02:06:14.670
<v Speaker 8>I'm not even with me.</v>

4318
02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:16.200
<v Speaker 8>I'm not even with me.</v>

4319
02:06:16.201 --> 02:06:17.250
<v Speaker 8>I don't understand it.</v>

4320
02:06:17.270 --> 02:06:17.781
<v Speaker 2>Here I'll do.</v>

4321
02:06:17.781 --> 02:06:19.040
<v Speaker 2>My question is when it says,</v>

4322
02:06:19.550 --> 02:06:20.120
<v Speaker 2>please,</v>

4323
02:06:20.120 --> 02:06:21.440
<v Speaker 2>when a huge star,</v>

4324
02:06:21.500 --> 02:06:24.860
<v Speaker 2>many times the mass of the sun comes to the end of its life,</v>

4325
02:06:24.861 --> 02:06:29.861
<v Speaker 2>it collapses in on itself and forms a singularity creating a black hole where</v>

4326
02:06:30.741 --> 02:06:35.090
<v Speaker 2>gravity is so strong that not even light itself can escape.</v>

4327
02:06:36.170 --> 02:06:39.050
<v Speaker 2>At least that's what we thought.</v>

4328
02:06:40.250 --> 02:06:43.760
<v Speaker 8>As scientist has sensationally said,</v>

4329
02:06:43.820 --> 02:06:48.820
<v Speaker 8>it is impossible for a black holes to exist and she even has the mathematical</v>

4330
02:06:51.561 --> 02:06:53.930
<v Speaker 8>proof to back up our claims.</v>

4331
02:06:54.280 --> 02:06:54.700
<v Speaker 8>I need to,</v>

4332
02:06:54.700 --> 02:06:58.240
<v Speaker 8>I should work at 14 and see true.</v>

4333
02:06:58.610 --> 02:07:03.610
<v Speaker 8>Her research could force physicist to scrap their theories of how the universe</v>

4334
02:07:04.161 --> 02:07:05.030
<v Speaker 8>began.</v>

4335
02:07:05.660 --> 02:07:08.150
<v Speaker 8>The research was conducted</v>

4336
02:07:08.460 --> 02:07:11.950
<v Speaker 2>by Professor Laura Marcy Ni.</v>

4337
02:07:12.120 --> 02:07:15.150
<v Speaker 2>How often from the University of North Carolina.</v>

4338
02:07:15.180 --> 02:07:15.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4339
02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:16.313
<v Speaker 2>I lost interest.</v>

<v Speaker 8>You say MIT.</v>

4343
02:07:20.401 --> 02:07:21.234
<v Speaker 8>I didn't hear that.</v>

4344
02:07:21.240 --> 02:07:22.680
<v Speaker 8>I heard the University of North Carolina</v>

4345

4376
02:08:17.470 --> 02:08:20.800
<v Speaker 8>I only went because I was worried that people thought I was a loser when I got</v>

4377
02:08:20.801 --> 02:08:21.311
<v Speaker 8>out of high school.</v>

4378
02:08:21.311 --> 02:08:23.020
<v Speaker 8>I had no idea what it's going to do and I kept telling him,</v>

4379
02:08:23.021 --> 02:08:24.610
<v Speaker 8>but I'm just going to take a year off.</v>

4380
02:08:24.790 --> 02:08:28.090
<v Speaker 8>And what I would tell girls that they would look at me with such disdain.</v>

4381
02:08:28.210 --> 02:08:28.780
<v Speaker 8>Fuck,</v>

<v Speaker 8>that's what I did.</v>

4383
02:08:31.130 --> 02:08:31.860
<v Speaker 8>Absolutely.</v>

4384
02:08:31.860 --> 02:08:35.010
<v Speaker 8>You had to go to college because that's what everybody in your class did.</v>

4385
02:08:35.011 --> 02:08:38.740
<v Speaker 8>And if you said you weren't going or you didn't know by you graduated high</v>

4386
02:08:38.741 --> 02:08:39.574
<v Speaker 8>school,</v>

4387
02:08:39.580 --> 02:08:40.150

<v Speaker 8>I didn't go.</v>

4390
02:08:43.030 --> 02:08:44.810
<v Speaker 8>I didn't experience that kind of discrimination.</v>

4391
02:08:44.811 --> 02:08:45.251
<v Speaker 8>But well,</v>

4392
02:08:45.251 --> 02:08:46.390
<v Speaker 8>it's not discrimination.</v>

4393
02:08:46.391 --> 02:08:51.391
<v Speaker 8>It's wanting you to live up to a certain quality of work ethic and standard.</v>

4394
02:08:52.450 --> 02:08:53.350

<v Speaker 8>I was in my Audi Fox.</v>

4448
02:10:32.290 --> 02:10:32.561
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

4449
02:10:32.561 --> 02:10:33.980
<v Speaker 8>I was coming home from my,</v>

4450
02:10:34.130 --> 02:10:39.130
<v Speaker 2>my gig where I was driving a private investigator that lost his job.</v>

4451
02:10:39.310 --> 02:10:43.520
<v Speaker 2>He lost his driver's license because he was Dui and he needed someone to drive</v>

4452
02:10:43.521 --> 02:10:44.001
<v Speaker 2>him around,</v>

4453
02:10:44.001 --> 02:10:48.230
<v Speaker 2>so he put out an ad in the want ads for an assistant for private investigator.</v>

4454
02:10:48.231 --> 02:10:49.250
<v Speaker 2>His name was dynamite.</v>

4455
02:10:49.251 --> 02:10:50.240
<v Speaker 2>Dickless Dave Dolan.</v>

4456
02:10:50.770 --> 02:10:54.440
<v Speaker 8>He's also still my good friend from Boston.</v>

4457
02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:55.191
<v Speaker 8>Look,</v>

4458
02:10:55.191 --> 02:10:56.330
<v Speaker 8>I wouldn't go back to Boston,</v>

4459
02:10:56.331 --> 02:10:57.710
<v Speaker 8>but that mother fucker shaped me.</v>

4460
02:10:58.080 --> 02:10:58.913
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

4461
02:10:58.970 --> 02:10:59.803
<v Speaker 8>Anyway,</v>

4462
02:11:00.220 --> 02:11:02.060
<v Speaker 8>that's driving back in April.</v>

4463
02:11:02.130 --> 02:11:04.160
<v Speaker 8>Snellen listened to Prince.</v>

4464
02:11:04.490 --> 02:11:06.710
<v Speaker 8>Sometimes it snows.</v>

4465
02:11:06.711 --> 02:11:07.221
<v Speaker 8>And I was like,</v>

4466
02:11:07.221 --> 02:11:08.780
<v Speaker 8>I gotta get the fuck out of Boston</v>

4467
02:11:11.210 --> 02:11:11.541
<v Speaker 8>kid.</v>

4468
02:11:11.541 --> 02:11:12.830
<v Speaker 8>Deal with snow in April.</v>

4469
02:11:13.160 --> 02:11:14.480
<v Speaker 8>Like what'd you get bombed?</v>

4470
02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:15.650
<v Speaker 8>I got blues all the time.</v>

4471
02:11:15.651 --> 02:11:16.484
<v Speaker 8>I was a loser.</v>

4472
02:11:17.330 --> 02:11:18.620
<v Speaker 8>I think that that's fair.</v>

4473
02:11:18.621 --> 02:11:19.454
<v Speaker 8>Everybody does that.</v>

4474
02:11:19.630 --> 02:11:22.850
<v Speaker 8>Well if you're super desperate and you're trying to carve your path in this</v>

4475
02:11:22.851 --> 02:11:25.820
<v Speaker 8>world with a rabid desperation like I was,</v>

4476
02:11:26.090 --> 02:11:26.870
<v Speaker 8>you're always,</v>

4477
02:11:26.870 --> 02:11:27.890
<v Speaker 8>you're always feeling like shit.</v>

4478
02:11:27.891 --> 02:11:28.370
<v Speaker 8>Sure.</v>

4479
02:11:28.370 --> 02:11:29.480
<v Speaker 8>Cause if you're not feeling like shit,</v>

4480
02:11:29.481 --> 02:11:30.380
<v Speaker 8>you feeling complacent,</v>

4481
02:11:30.410 --> 02:11:31.250
<v Speaker 8>feel completion,</v>

4482
02:11:31.610 --> 02:11:32.443
<v Speaker 8>nothing gets done.</v>

4483
02:11:32.870 --> 02:11:33.521
<v Speaker 8>Well you know the,</v>

4484
02:11:33.521 --> 02:11:34.900
<v Speaker 8>the blues come and go like that.</v>

4485
02:11:34.910 --> 02:11:36.800
<v Speaker 8>That's just inevitable I think at this point.</v>

4486
02:11:36.830 --> 02:11:41.570
<v Speaker 8>And when you accept it and you figured out what it is and what it means and you</v>

4487
02:11:41.571 --> 02:11:42.404
<v Speaker 8>just keep,</v>

4488
02:11:42.470 --> 02:11:43.040
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

4489
02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:45.500
<v Speaker 8>under having an understanding with yourself and</v>

4490
02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:46.920
<v Speaker 2>oh it's important that a certain,</v>

4491
02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:48.750
<v Speaker 2>a certain type of people,</v>

4492
02:11:48.780 --> 02:11:49.680
<v Speaker 2>like people that you listen to,</v>

4493
02:11:49.681 --> 02:11:54.120
<v Speaker 2>like someone like you or like you or like you guys name their,</v>

4494
02:11:54.121 --> 02:11:55.020
<v Speaker 2>their reality,</v>

4495
02:11:55.050 --> 02:11:58.260
<v Speaker 2>like talk about the reality and talk about the blues and then everybody goes,</v>

4496
02:11:58.380 --> 02:11:59.850
<v Speaker 2>oh I get it.</v>

4497
02:12:00.150 --> 02:12:01.470
<v Speaker 2>It's just a part of struggling.</v>

4498
02:12:01.930 --> 02:12:02.131
<v Speaker 2>They can.</v>

4499
02:12:02.131 --> 02:12:03.270
<v Speaker 2>Part is struggling is,</v>

4500
02:12:04.340 --> 02:12:09.340
<v Speaker 2>but I think you guys are super talented and we've been friends for years now and</v>

4501
02:12:09.571 --> 02:12:12.950
<v Speaker 2>I've always thought you guys are super talented from the moment I saw that that</v>

4502
02:12:13.140 --> 02:12:17.160
<v Speaker 2>one song where you guys were on top of the roof and you were saying an angel of</v>

4503
02:12:17.161 --> 02:12:17.460
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>

4504

<v Speaker 2>I think you guys are amazing.</v>

4506
02:12:20.010 --> 02:12:21.130
<v Speaker 2>But when,</v>

4507
02:12:21.170 --> 02:12:21.571
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

4508
02:12:21.571 --> 02:12:22.141
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

4509
02:12:22.141 --> 02:12:26.100
<v Speaker 2>when you connect with something like that and you see someone who's doing</v>

4510
02:12:26.101 --> 02:12:28.170
<v Speaker 2>something that like makes you like,</v>

4511
02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:32.370
<v Speaker 2>it makes you feel good when you see it and you want to spread it to these other</v>

4512
02:12:32.371 --> 02:12:33.204
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

4513
02:12:33.990 --> 02:12:35.840
<v Speaker 2>it's like what?</v>

4514
02:12:35.850 --> 02:12:36.151
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

4515
02:12:36.151 --> 02:12:36.984
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>

4516
02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:38.480
<v Speaker 2>What that is at the,</v>

4517
02:12:38.481 --> 02:12:43.481
<v Speaker 2>at its best it's like this is weird light that you can find the deep dark</v>

4518
02:12:43.771 --> 02:12:48.240
<v Speaker 2>tunnels of human creativity that makes you feel better about the struggle.</v>

4519
02:12:48.570 --> 02:12:51.210
<v Speaker 2>I like the fact that you guys haven't made it.</v>

4520
02:12:51.410 --> 02:12:51.880

02:14:46.650 --> 02:14:49.080
<v Speaker 8>And you guys are out to just fucking chipping away at it.</v>

4590
02:14:49.260 --> 02:14:50.400
<v Speaker 8>And slowly people are going,</v>

4591
02:14:50.550 --> 02:14:51.240
<v Speaker 8>Whoa,</v>

4592
02:14:51.240 --> 02:14:51.760

02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:52.450
<v Speaker 8>Fuck.</v>

4594
02:14:52.450 --> 02:14:55.370
<v Speaker 8>And that's what happens in this world and it makes it better.</v>

4595
02:14:55.370 --> 02:14:56.191
<v Speaker 8>I honestly,</v>

4596
02:14:56.191 --> 02:14:56.820
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

4597
02:14:56.820 --> 02:14:58.170
<v Speaker 8>I feel good about it.</v>

4598
02:14:58.290 --> 02:14:58.891
<v Speaker 8>You know what I mean?</v>

4599
02:14:58.891 --> 02:14:59.490
<v Speaker 8>I feel,</v>

4600
02:14:59.490 --> 02:15:03.960
<v Speaker 8>I feel all this all this time we're putting in now and who cares what happens on</v>

4601
02:15:04.020 --> 02:15:04.201
<v Speaker 8>Ben.</v>

4602
02:15:04.201 --> 02:15:05.610
<v Speaker 8>I don't picture you in bed with David.</v>

4603
02:15:05.611 --> 02:15:06.660
<v Speaker 8>Bowie is going to happen.</v>

4604
02:15:06.730 --> 02:15:07.760
<v Speaker 8>That shit happen tonight.</v>

4605
02:15:07.770 --> 02:15:08.603
<v Speaker 8>I know it's</v>

4606
02:15:10.130 --> 02:15:11.010
<v Speaker 8>taking a longer,</v>

4607
02:15:11.011 --> 02:15:11.844
<v Speaker 8>stronger row.</v>

4608
02:15:12.780 --> 02:15:16.020
<v Speaker 8>You get to know who you are by the time you get in bed with David Bowie and you</v>

4609
02:15:16.021 --> 02:15:16.231
<v Speaker 8>go,</v>

4610
02:15:16.231 --> 02:15:17.250
<v Speaker 8>you're going to go like call me.</v>

4611
02:15:17.251 --> 02:15:18.510
<v Speaker 8>I love the music.</v>

4612
02:15:18.780 --> 02:15:19.613
<v Speaker 8>I love,</v>

4613
02:15:19.650 --> 02:15:20.580
<v Speaker 8>I love your music.</v>

4614
02:15:21.340 --> 02:15:23.370
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to fucking give you a hug and I'm going to go home.</v>

4615
02:15:23.530 --> 02:15:25.260
<v Speaker 8>It's actually a express ourselves differently.</v>

4616
02:15:28.140 --> 02:15:29.100
<v Speaker 8>Mutual respect,</v>

4617
02:15:29.460 --> 02:15:30.360
<v Speaker 8>no touching.</v>

4618
02:15:30.390 --> 02:15:33.060
<v Speaker 8>I think it's super important to go through that struggle.</v>

4619
02:15:33.061 --> 02:15:37.320
<v Speaker 8>I think that if you guys had somehow or another like started out together and</v>

4620
02:15:37.321 --> 02:15:39.120
<v Speaker 8>then a week later someone came along and went,</v>

4621
02:15:39.121 --> 02:15:39.931
<v Speaker 8>Holy Shit,</v>

4622
02:15:39.931 --> 02:15:41.370
<v Speaker 8>you guys are fucking great.</v>

4623
02:15:43.190 --> 02:15:43.460
<v Speaker 8>Not</v>

4624
02:15:43.460 --> 02:15:43.761
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

4625
02:15:43.761 --> 02:15:44.594
<v Speaker 5>but it didn't.</v>

4626
02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:46.193
<v Speaker 5>That's dead.</v>

4627
02:15:46.280 --> 02:15:47.690
<v Speaker 5>But that's what's so cool about,</v>

4628
02:15:47.691 --> 02:15:48.524
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

4629
02:15:49.100 --> 02:15:50.330
<v Speaker 5>everyone has a different,</v>

4630
02:15:50.900 --> 02:15:52.100
<v Speaker 5>different way to get there,</v>

4631
02:15:52.240 --> 02:15:52.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4632
02:15:52.820 --> 02:15:53.780
<v Speaker 5>different vehicle.</v>

4633
02:15:54.080 --> 02:15:54.680
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

4634
02:15:54.680 --> 02:15:55.400
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4635
02:15:55.400 --> 02:15:59.630
<v Speaker 5>I think about that a lot because we've been through so much shit together.</v>

4636
02:15:59.631 --> 02:16:03.530
<v Speaker 5>We've been through so much in our personal lives and in the career.</v>

4637
02:16:03.890 --> 02:16:04.251
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4638
02:16:04.251 --> 02:16:04.970
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>

4639
02:16:04.970 --> 02:16:09.970
<v Speaker 5>I feel really lucky for that because I have so much information and experience</v>

4640
02:16:11.301 --> 02:16:14.030
<v Speaker 5>and understanding of what this business entails.</v>

4641
02:16:14.031 --> 02:16:14.540
<v Speaker 5>We've,</v>

4642
02:16:14.540 --> 02:16:15.770
<v Speaker 5>we've booked our own shows,</v>

4643
02:16:15.771 --> 02:16:17.240
<v Speaker 5>we've been around manager at times,</v>

4644
02:16:17.241 --> 02:16:18.740
<v Speaker 5>we've done all the shit,</v>

4645
02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:19.311
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4646
02:16:19.311 --> 02:16:19.610
<v Speaker 5>and if,</v>

4647
02:16:19.610 --> 02:16:23.480
<v Speaker 5>if we had like blown up when we were young,</v>

4648
02:16:23.870 --> 02:16:25.100
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what would have happened.</v>

4649
02:16:25.101 --> 02:16:27.200
<v Speaker 5>That's a terrifying thought because,</v>

4650
02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:28.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4651
02:16:28.700 --> 02:16:29.620
<v Speaker 5>we talk about this a lot,</v>

4652
02:16:29.621 --> 02:16:32.700
<v Speaker 5>but essentially like being good people and,</v>

4653
02:16:32.701 --> 02:16:33.040
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

4654
02:16:33.040 --> 02:16:36.070
<v Speaker 5>and having a legitimate reason for doing this,</v>

4655
02:16:36.100 --> 02:16:38.800
<v Speaker 5>not like some mass predatory,</v>

4656
02:16:38.830 --> 02:16:39.151
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4657
02:16:39.151 --> 02:16:39.371
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4658
02:16:39.371 --> 02:16:40.480
<v Speaker 5>I would just want to be the best.</v>

4659
02:16:40.660 --> 02:16:41.800
<v Speaker 5>That's not why we play music.</v>

4660
02:16:41.801 --> 02:16:42.634
<v Speaker 5>And that's stupid.</v>

4661
02:16:43.090 --> 02:16:43.810
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

4662
02:16:43.810 --> 02:16:44.320
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4663
02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:45.160
<v Speaker 5>narcissistic.</v>

4664
02:16:45.730 --> 02:16:46.563
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

4665
02:16:46.760 --> 02:16:49.930
<v Speaker 5>we've had all these crazy experiences and,</v>

4666
02:16:49.931 --> 02:16:51.070
<v Speaker 5>and difficult times and,</v>

4667
02:16:52.260 --> 02:16:52.990
<v Speaker 5>and it was,</v>

4668
02:16:52.990 --> 02:16:55.390
<v Speaker 5>that's what he's done with Matt.</v>

4669
02:16:56.110 --> 02:16:56.820
<v Speaker 5>Does that mean</v>

4670
02:16:56.820 --> 02:16:58.300
<v Speaker 8>keep it</v>

4671
02:17:02.840 --> 02:17:05.440
<v Speaker 8>close to our goal?</v>

4672
02:17:06.670 --> 02:17:08.290
<v Speaker 8>I told you it was the end of the world.</v>

4673
02:17:08.291 --> 02:17:09.124
<v Speaker 8>The fighter jets.</v>

<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

02:21:49.870 --> 02:21:52.900
<v Speaker 2>and one of the big things that happens is after specials out,</v>

4864
02:21:52.901 --> 02:21:53.770
<v Speaker 2>I scramble,</v>

4865
02:21:53.980 --> 02:21:56.800
<v Speaker 2>I go in this mad panic state where I have to come up with a bunch of new</v>

4866
02:21:56.801 --> 02:21:59.080
<v Speaker 2>material and it's good and it's bad.</v>

02:22:00.900 --> 02:22:04.780
<v Speaker 2>I sometimes the house from rough sets come to see me while I'm right working out</v>

4872
02:22:07.300 --> 02:22:08.140
<v Speaker 2>It'll all work out.</v>

4873
02:22:08.590 --> 02:22:09.740
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

4874
02:22:09.790 --> 02:22:11.950
<v Speaker 2>along the lines of like doing all this,</v>

4875
02:22:11.980 --> 02:22:14.740
<v Speaker 2>I started exposing myself to a bunch of different things.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I try to expose myself to as many things as possible.</v>

02:28:35.810 --> 02:28:37.850
<v Speaker 2>I had to hear that song over and over and over again.</v>

02:28:38.390 --> 02:28:39.350
<v Speaker 2>I played that song.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I played that song close to a hundred times.</v>

5002
02:28:42.710 --> 02:28:46.490
<v Speaker 2>If I had to stop and guess I played at one time at the gym,</v>

5003
02:28:46.850 --> 02:28:51.170
<v Speaker 2>I put it on repeat and I got on the stair climber and I went to half an hour and</v>

5004
02:28:51.171 --> 02:28:53.060
<v Speaker 2>I listen to your fucking song for half an hour.</v>

5005
02:28:54.260 --> 02:28:57.500
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to figure out what song to use for the beginning of the special and</v>

5006
02:28:57.501 --> 02:28:58.790
<v Speaker 2>I had a bunch of your songs,</v>

5007
02:28:58.791 --> 02:29:01.650
<v Speaker 2>your old songs and new songs and uh,</v>

5008
02:29:05.960 --> 02:29:06.501
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

5009
02:29:06.501 --> 02:29:09.560
<v Speaker 2>I listened to that song over and over again for half an hour is actually the</v>

5010
02:29:09.561 --> 02:29:10.340
<v Speaker 2>elliptical.</v>

5011
02:29:10.340 --> 02:29:12.650
<v Speaker 2>I misspoke on the stair climber me day.</v>

5012
02:29:12.900 --> 02:29:15.890
<v Speaker 2>I remember the joints allegedly,</v>

5013
02:29:15.920 --> 02:29:17.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't think stair climber is bad for the joints.</v>

5014
02:29:17.481 --> 02:29:18.830
<v Speaker 2>It just gives the joint some work.</v>

5015
02:29:20.360 --> 02:29:22.040
<v Speaker 2>Bitch ass joints cause of work.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Stop being scared.</v>

5017
02:29:24.110 --> 02:29:26.480

<v Speaker 8>Just blow it on her homeboy Uber little.</v>

5166
02:34:03.840 --> 02:34:04.673
<v Speaker 8>Oh yeah.</v>

5167
02:34:05.820 --> 02:34:06.241
<v Speaker 8>Don't worry.</v>

5168
02:34:06.241 --> 02:34:06.541
<v Speaker 8>Don't worry.</v>

5169
02:34:06.541 --> 02:34:07.374
<v Speaker 8>We're good.</v>

5170
02:34:10.220 --> 02:34:11.053
<v Speaker 8>Don't,</v>

5171
02:34:11.950 --> 02:34:14.390
<v Speaker 8>no one</v>

5172
02:34:16.930 --> 02:34:18.030
<v Speaker 8>calls to a</v>

5173
02:34:18.150 --> 02:34:18.450
<v Speaker 4>push.</v>

5174
02:34:18.450 --> 02:34:19.090
<v Speaker 4>Hey listen,</v>

5175
02:34:19.090 --> 02:34:20.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to make something happen here.</v>

5176
02:34:20.411 --> 02:34:21.244
<v Speaker 4>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

5177
02:34:21.520 --> 02:34:25.060
<v Speaker 4>this is my second person I've convinced into smoking weed this month.</v>

5178
02:34:25.390 --> 02:34:27.370
<v Speaker 4>Number one was Graham Hancock number.</v>

5179
02:34:28.090 --> 02:34:28.960
<v Speaker 4>Graham Hancock,</v>

5180
02:34:30.610 --> 02:34:31.450
<v Speaker 4>a friend of mine,</v>

5181
02:34:31.451 --> 02:34:33.430
<v Speaker 4>his name is BC is going on.</v>

5182
02:34:33.431 --> 02:34:34.540
<v Speaker 4>You have a friend named beasties.</v>

5183
02:34:34.830 --> 02:34:35.740
<v Speaker 4>His name's BC,</v>

5184
02:34:35.920 --> 02:34:36.753
<v Speaker 4>and he's going,</v>

5185
02:34:36.790 --> 02:34:39.870
<v Speaker 4>he's going on one of Graham Hancock's tours in Egypt.</v>

5186
02:34:39.900 --> 02:34:40.151
<v Speaker 4>Plan.</v>

5187
02:34:40.151 --> 02:34:40.984
<v Speaker 4>He's amazing.</v>

5188
02:34:41.360 --> 02:34:42.550
<v Speaker 4>I love the shit out of that guy.</v>

5189
02:34:42.551 --> 02:34:46.480
<v Speaker 4>And he was on the podcast and he had taken a three year break from marijuana and</v>

5190
02:34:46.481 --> 02:34:49.360
<v Speaker 4>he was talking about how he missed it while you realize it was kind of abusing</v>

5191
02:34:49.361 --> 02:34:50.650
<v Speaker 4>it and who's doing it all day.</v>

5192
02:34:50.950 --> 02:34:52.210
<v Speaker 4>And it was used again as a crutch.</v>

5193
02:34:52.390 --> 02:34:56.320
<v Speaker 4>And he did Iowasca and he recognized the fact that he was using it as a crutch.</v>

5194
02:34:56.321 --> 02:34:58.390
<v Speaker 4>And then on the podcast he was talking about how he missed it.</v>

5195
02:34:58.960 --> 02:35:00.430
<v Speaker 4>And so he took one,</v>

5196
02:35:00.431 --> 02:35:01.450
<v Speaker 4>maybe two heads,</v>

5197
02:35:01.660 --> 02:35:04.870
<v Speaker 4>and then just opened up like a flower.</v>

5198
02:35:05.350 --> 02:35:06.183
<v Speaker 4>Beautiful.</v>

5199
02:35:07.480 --> 02:35:12.460
<v Speaker 4>You snip is a reason why the table so flight is going to trust my instincts.</v>

5200
02:35:13.730 --> 02:35:15.250
<v Speaker 4>I love him so much.</v>

5201
02:35:15.860 --> 02:35:17.360
<v Speaker 4>But he started talking about,</v>

5202
02:35:18.210 --> 02:35:21.550
<v Speaker 4>he started talking and like with these great passion about these ancient</v>

5203
02:35:21.730 --> 02:35:26.590
<v Speaker 4>civilizations that probably existed in Egypt and the resistance to accepting</v>

5204
02:35:26.591 --> 02:35:27.600
<v Speaker 4>them and he has his office.</v>

5205
02:35:27.860 --> 02:35:29.560
<v Speaker 4>This is fucking beautiful wrap.</v>

5206
02:35:29.561 --> 02:35:30.460
<v Speaker 4>It's like a song.</v>

5207
02:35:30.580 --> 02:35:31.241
<v Speaker 4>It's like a song.</v>

5208
02:35:31.241 --> 02:35:31.460
<v Speaker 4>Lee,</v>

5209
02:35:31.460 --> 02:35:31.750
<v Speaker 4>when he,</v>

5210
02:35:31.750 --> 02:35:33.310
<v Speaker 4>when we really locks into it,</v>

5211
02:35:33.520 --> 02:35:36.760
<v Speaker 4>when he really locks into this discussion of these ancient civilizations,</v>

5212
02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:41.800
<v Speaker 4>it's such a passion for him that he's constructed the narrative and like this</v>

5213
02:35:41.801 --> 02:35:45.280
<v Speaker 4>really beautiful melodic sort of like,</v>

5214
02:35:45.310 --> 02:35:45.671
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

5215
02:35:45.671 --> 02:35:46.720
<v Speaker 4>like a play.</v>

5216
02:35:47.170 --> 02:35:48.250
<v Speaker 4>So when he tells it to you,</v>

5217
02:35:48.251 --> 02:35:49.300
<v Speaker 4>it's hypnotic.</v>

5218
02:35:49.720 --> 02:35:49.961
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5219
02:35:49.961 --> 02:35:50.111
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

5220
02:35:50.111 --> 02:35:51.460
<v Speaker 4>Tom's gone so deep.</v>

5221
02:35:51.910 --> 02:35:52.480
<v Speaker 4>So Dean,</v>

5222
02:35:52.480 --> 02:35:53.260
<v Speaker 4>that's incredible.</v>

5223
02:35:53.260 --> 02:35:57.400
<v Speaker 4>And every year some new shit comes out that makes him,</v>

5224
02:35:57.610 --> 02:35:58.990
<v Speaker 4>where's that coming from?</v>

5225
02:35:59.830 --> 02:36:00.281
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean?</v>

5226
02:36:00.281 --> 02:36:00.880
<v Speaker 4>Which which?</v>

5227
02:36:00.880 --> 02:36:01.870
<v Speaker 4>Which says new shit.</v>

5228
02:36:01.871 --> 02:36:03.060
<v Speaker 4>Is that archaeology or?</v>

5229
02:36:03.400 --> 02:36:04.233
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5230
02:36:04.240 --> 02:36:05.530
<v Speaker 4>Well there's every year.</v>

5231
02:36:05.590 --> 02:36:06.280
<v Speaker 4>Like grandma,</v>

5232
02:36:06.280 --> 02:36:07.090
<v Speaker 4>if you don't know,</v>

5233
02:36:07.090 --> 02:36:08.200
<v Speaker 4>Graham Hancock rang.</v>

5234
02:36:08.890 --> 02:36:13.540
<v Speaker 4>Graham wrote an amazing book called the fingerprints of the gods and</v>

5235
02:36:13.690 --> 02:36:14.920
<v Speaker 4>fingerprints of the gods are footprints.</v>

5236
02:36:16.660 --> 02:36:17.493
<v Speaker 4>Fingerprints.</v>

5237
02:36:18.600 --> 02:36:19.690
<v Speaker 4>I think it's for me to make sure</v>

5238
02:36:21.350 --> 02:36:22.900
<v Speaker 4>the two feet in the beach and stuff.</v>

5239
02:36:23.030 --> 02:36:23.863
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5240
02:36:24.250 --> 02:36:26.320
<v Speaker 4>Footprints of the God's fingerprints.</v>

5241
02:36:28.360 --> 02:36:29.193
<v Speaker 4>Fingerprints on the gun.</v>

5242
02:36:29.250 --> 02:36:29.650
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

5243
02:36:29.650 --> 02:36:30.483
<v Speaker 4>Fingerprints.</v>

5244
02:36:30.610 --> 02:36:31.090
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

5245
02:36:31.090 --> 02:36:31.780
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>

5246
02:36:31.780 --> 02:36:32.410
<v Speaker 4>I forget.</v>

5247
02:36:32.410 --> 02:36:33.610
<v Speaker 4>I've read it and I forget.</v>

5248
02:36:33.790 --> 02:36:34.623
<v Speaker 4>It's just a title.</v>

5249
02:36:34.690 --> 02:36:35.510
<v Speaker 4>It's just a word.</v>

5250
02:36:35.510 --> 02:36:36.820
<v Speaker 4>Just noise you make with your mouth,</v>

5251
02:36:37.450 --> 02:36:42.450
<v Speaker 4>but the idea behind it was that what he believed is that there are established</v>

5252
02:36:43.270 --> 02:36:48.270
<v Speaker 4>areas of the world where there's archeology that they can't quite explain.</v>

5253
02:36:48.820 --> 02:36:52.450
<v Speaker 4>Massive stones cut with extreme precision,</v>

5254
02:36:52.600 --> 02:36:54.010
<v Speaker 4>moved into position.</v>

5255
02:36:54.820 --> 02:36:55.580
<v Speaker 4>John Hinges,</v>

5256
02:36:55.580 --> 02:36:56.261
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>

5257
02:36:56.261 --> 02:36:58.630
<v Speaker 4>There's a place called [inaudible] back in Lebanon,</v>

5258
02:36:58.631 --> 02:37:00.310
<v Speaker 4>something greater than Stonehenge.</v>

5259
02:37:00.730 --> 02:37:01.520
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>

5260
02:37:01.520 --> 02:37:02.380
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

5261
02:37:03.780 --> 02:37:04.840
<v Speaker 4>It's not just one.</v>

5262
02:37:04.841 --> 02:37:05.710
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of them.</v>

5263
02:37:06.090 --> 02:37:10.390
<v Speaker 4>It's like the oldest pyramids have survived much longer than the newer pyramids.</v>

5264
02:37:10.391 --> 02:37:11.224
<v Speaker 4>There was a certain,</v>

5265
02:37:11.230 --> 02:37:13.420
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about all that that's in the book,</v>

5266
02:37:14.640 --> 02:37:15.321
<v Speaker 4>but the Pure,</v>

5267
02:37:15.321 --> 02:37:16.160
<v Speaker 4>the pyramid thing</v>

5268
02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:20.750
<v Speaker 2>is really under dispute between people that are real and Shit Egyptologists and</v>

5269
02:37:20.751 --> 02:37:25.751
<v Speaker 2>people like John Anthony West who's this brilliant alternative Egyptology</v>

5270
02:37:25.761 --> 02:37:29.250
<v Speaker 2>thinker and Graham Hancock and a lot of these revisionist guys.</v>

5271
02:37:29.450 --> 02:37:32.630
<v Speaker 2>There's still some debate as to what's correct and what's not correct,</v>

5272
02:37:33.080 --> 02:37:37.290
<v Speaker 2>but there's been a lot of evidence that that dates the great pyramid.</v>

5273
02:37:37.291 --> 02:37:42.291
<v Speaker 2>It's like the pyramid of Giza to 2,500 BC and that doesn't jive with this Guy</v>

5274
02:37:45.020 --> 02:37:48.920
<v Speaker 2>Robert Schoch who's a geologist at Boston University and this Guy John Anthony</v>

5275
02:37:48.920 --> 02:37:52.670
<v Speaker 2>West and Graham Hancock who believed that there's all sorts of evidence that</v>

5276
02:37:52.671 --> 02:37:56.780
<v Speaker 2>there was massive erosion that probably came from rainfall and one of them was</v>

5277
02:37:56.781 --> 02:37:57.480
<v Speaker 2>on the inside.</v>

5278
02:37:57.480 --> 02:37:59.420
<v Speaker 2>The enclosure with a Sphinx was built,</v>

5279
02:37:59.690 --> 02:38:00.011
<v Speaker 2>so we,</v>

5280
02:38:00.011 --> 02:38:00.980
<v Speaker 2>the Sphinx was built,</v>

5281
02:38:00.981 --> 02:38:02.390
<v Speaker 2>it was sort of cut out of this,</v>

5282
02:38:02.620 --> 02:38:02.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5283
02:38:02.840 --> 02:38:07.840
<v Speaker 2>big stone quarry and the stones that were cut out where presumably smooth but</v>

5284
02:38:08.031 --> 02:38:12.140
<v Speaker 2>over like thousands and thousands of years have become like contoured.</v>

5285
02:38:12.350 --> 02:38:17.060
<v Speaker 2>And the debate is whether or not that contour is because of erosion with sand</v>

5286
02:38:17.061 --> 02:38:19.190
<v Speaker 2>and wind or because of water.</v>

5287
02:38:19.460 --> 02:38:22.880
<v Speaker 2>And there's a bunch of geologists that have got behind the water and they're</v>

5288
02:38:22.881 --> 02:38:24.340
<v Speaker 2>saying this is water erosion.</v>

5289
02:38:24.360 --> 02:38:25.910
<v Speaker 2>This is consistent with water erosion.</v>

5290
02:38:26.090 --> 02:38:27.530
<v Speaker 2>The number one being the most prominent.</v>

5291
02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:31.700
<v Speaker 2>Robert Schoch who is a geologist at Boston University,</v>

5292
02:38:31.701 --> 02:38:34.850
<v Speaker 2>he's done a bunch of papers on this and explained that what we're probably</v>

5293
02:38:34.851 --> 02:38:37.160
<v Speaker 2>looking at is thousands of years of rainfall.</v>

5294
02:38:37.161 --> 02:38:42.080
<v Speaker 2>That's a of these things which would predate the construction of this area.</v>

5295
02:38:42.230 --> 02:38:43.063
<v Speaker 2>The cutout,</v>

5296
02:38:43.100 --> 02:38:43.241
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5297
02:38:43.241 --> 02:38:43.421
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5298
02:38:43.421 --> 02:38:43.581
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5299
02:38:43.581 --> 02:38:44.210
<v Speaker 2>the like the,</v>

5300
02:38:44.210 --> 02:38:45.250
<v Speaker 2>the flat wall,</v>

5301
02:38:45.270 --> 02:38:47.750
<v Speaker 2>this area to like 9,000 BC,</v>

5302
02:38:47.900 --> 02:38:51.500
<v Speaker 2>which they don't have any civilizations that they knew of before,</v>

5303
02:38:51.530 --> 02:38:52.310
<v Speaker 2>like that age.</v>

5304
02:38:52.310 --> 02:38:53.840
<v Speaker 2>If it was me making that kind of shit,</v>

5305
02:38:53.990 --> 02:38:57.290
<v Speaker 2>but then they found some stuff in Turkey called Gold Beckley Tempe.</v>

5306
02:38:57.291 --> 02:38:59.800
<v Speaker 2>They found this big structure that's like this.</v>

5307
02:38:59.810 --> 02:39:00.980
<v Speaker 2>They're just in covering it now.</v>

5308
02:39:00.981 --> 02:39:03.110
<v Speaker 2>I think they've only got like 10% of it uncovered.</v>

5309
02:39:03.290 --> 02:39:04.270
<v Speaker 2>So every innocence,</v>

5310
02:39:04.310 --> 02:39:07.670
<v Speaker 2>14,000 years old between 12 and 14,000 years old.</v>

5311
02:39:07.760 --> 02:39:08.660
<v Speaker 2>So every year,</v>

5312
02:39:08.661 --> 02:39:10.130
<v Speaker 2>like they find more shit.</v>

5313
02:39:10.250 --> 02:39:13.580
<v Speaker 2>That makes Graham Hancock's theories like look more and more plausible.</v>

5314
02:39:13.760 --> 02:39:17.120
<v Speaker 2>And then he's got together with a bunch of other people that know about like</v>

5315
02:39:17.420 --> 02:39:20.240
<v Speaker 2>asteroidal impacts this guy Randall Carlson,</v>

5316
02:39:20.270 --> 02:39:20.750
<v Speaker 2>who's an,</v>

5317
02:39:20.750 --> 02:39:24.520
<v Speaker 2>he's an expert on extinction events like asteroidal impacts and</v>

5318
02:39:24.920 --> 02:39:25.753
<v Speaker 8>and events.</v>

5319
02:39:26.530 --> 02:39:27.910
<v Speaker 8>Besides the dinosaur thing.</v>

5320
02:39:27.911 --> 02:39:29.280
<v Speaker 8>What has been a fuck load of time?</v>

5321
02:39:29.310 --> 02:39:29.770
<v Speaker 8>Look,</v>

5322
02:39:29.770 --> 02:39:32.290
<v Speaker 8>keep deferring it this been a fuck load of that talk.</v>

5323
02:39:32.291 --> 02:39:34.210
<v Speaker 8>And they think they happen all the time,</v>

5324
02:39:34.211 --> 02:39:34.421
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>

5325
02:39:34.421 --> 02:39:36.790
<v Speaker 8>They think they have them like every 12 13,000 years.</v>

5326
02:39:36.791 --> 02:39:37.151
<v Speaker 8>So we'll,</v>

5327
02:39:37.151 --> 02:39:37.481
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>

5328
02:39:37.481 --> 02:39:38.860
<v Speaker 8>so 12 13,000 years ago,</v>

5329
02:39:38.861 --> 02:39:41.050
<v Speaker 8>what went extinct as a result of an asteroid exploding?</v>

5330
02:39:42.310 --> 02:39:43.143
<v Speaker 8>I don't even know what I'm saying.</v>

5331
02:39:43.540 --> 02:39:44.860
<v Speaker 8>They believe like this is,</v>

5332
02:39:44.861 --> 02:39:48.760
<v Speaker 8>there's a lot of like guesswork when it comes to anything that's like 12,000</v>

5333
02:39:48.761 --> 02:39:49.180
<v Speaker 8>years ago.</v>

5334
02:39:49.180 --> 02:39:49.871
<v Speaker 8>There's a lot of like,</v>

5335
02:39:49.871 --> 02:39:50.704
<v Speaker 8>what the hell happened?</v>

5336
02:39:50.800 --> 02:39:51.410
<v Speaker 8>Who knows?</v>

5337
02:39:51.410 --> 02:39:53.860
<v Speaker 8>Like we like to think of 12,000 is like,</v>

5338
02:39:53.980 --> 02:39:54.191
<v Speaker 8>look,</v>

5339
02:39:54.191 --> 02:39:56.230
<v Speaker 8>if you have $12,000 you can't buy a house.</v>

5340
02:39:56.590 --> 02:39:57.423
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

5341
02:40:00.470 --> 02:40:02.270
<v Speaker 8>if you borrow a car,</v>

5342
02:40:02.320 --> 02:40:05.800
<v Speaker 8>if you buy a car for $12,000 don't expect to impress anybody,</v>

5343
02:40:05.830 --> 02:40:06.460
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

5344
02:40:06.460 --> 02:40:06.731
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

5345
02:40:06.731 --> 02:40:07.101
<v Speaker 8>If you're,</v>

5346
02:40:07.101 --> 02:40:07.511
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

5347
02:40:07.511 --> 02:40:08.980
<v Speaker 8>$12,000 it's not much.</v>

5348
02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:10.510
<v Speaker 8>So 12,000 years,</v>

5349
02:40:11.050 --> 02:40:11.771
<v Speaker 8>Eh,</v>

5350
02:40:11.771 --> 02:40:12.580
<v Speaker 8>what is that?</v>

5351
02:40:12.580 --> 02:40:13.530
<v Speaker 8>It doesn't seem that much,</v>

5352
02:40:13.620 --> 02:40:14.100
<v Speaker 8>but it's</v>

5353
02:40:14.100 --> 02:40:19.100
<v Speaker 6>I'll fucking long time and 12,000 years ago,</v>

5354
02:40:20.011 --> 02:40:25.011
<v Speaker 6>it's very possible that Earth was smashed all over the place with these</v>

5355
02:40:25.411 --> 02:40:26.850
<v Speaker 6>asteroidal impacts.</v>

5356
02:40:27.210 --> 02:40:31.590
<v Speaker 6>They keep finding all this stuff like they found recently found these micro</v>

5357
02:40:31.591 --> 02:40:35.130
<v Speaker 6>diamonds that indicates some sort of impact and then they found this stuff</v>

5358
02:40:35.131 --> 02:40:36.510
<v Speaker 6>called nuclear glass.</v>

5359
02:40:36.660 --> 02:40:39.210
<v Speaker 6>It's like it's like called Triton night or something like that.</v>

5360
02:40:39.330 --> 02:40:43.530
<v Speaker 6>And it comes from impacts from these giant rocks just slamming into the earth</v>

5361
02:40:43.710 --> 02:40:46.440
<v Speaker 6>and it's all all over like Europe and Asia.</v>

5362
02:40:46.590 --> 02:40:49.440
<v Speaker 6>It's all hot around 12,000 years ago.</v>

5363
02:40:49.800 --> 02:40:53.070
<v Speaker 6>Does that speak to any extinction that happened or is that the kind of thing</v>

5364
02:40:53.071 --> 02:40:53.370
<v Speaker 6>where like,</v>

5365
02:40:53.370 --> 02:40:53.611
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

5366
02:40:53.611 --> 02:40:54.000
<v Speaker 6>these,</v>

5367
02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:59.000
<v Speaker 6>these headed in a different part of the world so it didn't affect the</v>

5368
02:40:59.041 --> 02:41:02.480
<v Speaker 6>environment like the dinosaur media or,</v>

5369
02:41:02.490 --> 02:41:02.671
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

5370
02:41:02.671 --> 02:41:04.140
<v Speaker 6>I'm totally talking out of school.</v>

5371
02:41:04.141 --> 02:41:05.310
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.</v>

5372
02:41:05.311 --> 02:41:09.180
<v Speaker 6>I have no scholar lead degrees on any of the subject convincing.</v>

5373
02:41:09.220 --> 02:41:14.220
<v Speaker 6>But the way it's been explained to me is there's a great mystery involving what</v>

5374
02:41:14.221 --> 02:41:16.740
<v Speaker 6>happens when you have like,</v>

5375
02:41:16.990 --> 02:41:17.340
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5376
02:41:17.340 --> 02:41:17.791
<v Speaker 6>w w.</v>

5377
02:41:17.791 --> 02:41:20.250
<v Speaker 6>W what happens when you have like some big extinction event?</v>

5378
02:41:20.280 --> 02:41:22.800
<v Speaker 6>Like where you like have no saber tooth tigers left.</v>

5379
02:41:22.980 --> 02:41:23.820
<v Speaker 6>You have no wooly tooth.</v>

5380
02:41:23.821 --> 02:41:24.930
<v Speaker 6>Mammas what happened?</v>

5381
02:41:24.960 --> 02:41:29.760
<v Speaker 6>How'd they all die and they've pinpointed a very specific time and it</v>

5382
02:41:29.761 --> 02:41:31.560
<v Speaker 6>corresponds the same time.</v>

5383
02:41:31.561 --> 02:41:33.810
<v Speaker 6>They're finding this stuff all over the place.</v>

5384
02:41:34.070 --> 02:41:34.480
<v Speaker 6>This stuff,</v>

5385
02:41:34.480 --> 02:41:35.850
<v Speaker 6>when they do the core samples,</v>

5386
02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:36.630
<v Speaker 6>so some,</v>

5387
02:41:36.630 --> 02:41:37.441
<v Speaker 6>it's very likely,</v>

5388
02:41:37.441 --> 02:41:41.700
<v Speaker 6>it's somewhere around 12,000 years ago we got fucked up.</v>

5389
02:41:42.150 --> 02:41:47.150
<v Speaker 6>Giant rocks from the sky just came down and fucked everything up and a few few</v>

5390
02:41:47.371 --> 02:41:48.204
<v Speaker 6>people made it,</v>

5391
02:41:48.480 --> 02:41:48.960
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5392
02:41:48.960 --> 02:41:49.920
<v Speaker 6>who knows how many.</v>

5393
02:41:50.310 --> 02:41:51.000
<v Speaker 6>So the,</v>

5394
02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.220
<v Speaker 6>the humans were actually present then?</v>

5395
02:41:53.310 --> 02:41:54.143
<v Speaker 6>Most likely.</v>

5396
02:41:54.180 --> 02:41:54.511
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5397
02:41:54.511 --> 02:41:56.910
<v Speaker 6>100% 12,000 years ago is gone that long.</v>

5398
02:41:57.360 --> 02:41:58.010
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5399
02:41:58.010 --> 02:41:58.440
<v Speaker 6>Weird.</v>

5400
02:41:58.440 --> 02:42:00.150
<v Speaker 6>We probably looked exactly like us.</v>

5401
02:42:00.810 --> 02:42:01.710
<v Speaker 6>Oh totally.</v>

5402
02:42:03.420 --> 02:42:04.260
<v Speaker 5>Tattoos.</v>

5403
02:42:04.930 --> 02:42:05.920
<v Speaker 6>I don't mean like that,</v>

5404
02:42:05.921 --> 02:42:07.300
<v Speaker 6>but I mean like our structure,</v>

5405
02:42:07.570 --> 02:42:08.710
<v Speaker 6>like if you took a dude,</v>

5406
02:42:09.250 --> 02:42:12.670
<v Speaker 6>they probably didn't get as much food so they would probably like smaller.</v>

5407
02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:14.620
<v Speaker 6>But if you took a brain though,</v>

5408
02:42:14.890 --> 02:42:15.551
<v Speaker 6>very similar,</v>

5409
02:42:15.551 --> 02:42:15.940
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

5410
02:42:15.940 --> 02:42:17.500
<v Speaker 6>If you could took a person,</v>

5411
02:42:17.770 --> 02:42:18.101
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5412
02:42:18.101 --> 02:42:23.080
<v Speaker 6>regular person from 12,000 years ago and put them in a movie theater and walk by</v>

5413
02:42:23.081 --> 02:42:24.340
<v Speaker 6>them while you're sitting in your seat.</v>

5414
02:42:24.380 --> 02:42:26.530
<v Speaker 6>You have no idea it would look like to you.</v>

5415
02:42:27.190 --> 02:42:27.401
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5416
02:42:27.401 --> 02:42:28.234
<v Speaker 6>it was us,</v>

5417
02:42:28.750 --> 02:42:29.583
<v Speaker 6>Jesus.</v>

5418
02:42:29.620 --> 02:42:32.020
<v Speaker 6>So those people probably had to start all over.</v>

5419
02:42:32.320 --> 02:42:33.010
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

5420
02:42:33.010 --> 02:42:34.390
<v Speaker 6>but depending on where this is,</v>

5421
02:42:34.391 --> 02:42:38.510
<v Speaker 6>what I'm just to understand is depending on where the APP asteroid</v>

5422
02:42:38.870 --> 02:42:40.280
<v Speaker 5>or make me smoke,</v>

5423
02:42:42.020 --> 02:42:42.621
<v Speaker 5>it's gonna go.</v>

5424
02:42:42.621 --> 02:42:43.280
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>

5425
02:42:43.280 --> 02:42:44.230
<v Speaker 5>This is going to give bed.</v>

5426
02:42:45.120 --> 02:42:46.310
<v Speaker 5>I lost my sparkle.</v>

5427
02:42:48.110 --> 02:42:50.030
<v Speaker 5>What sparkle did you lose?</v>

5428
02:42:51.180 --> 02:42:52.013
<v Speaker 5>One</v>

5429
02:42:53.450 --> 02:42:54.740
<v Speaker 5>please continue what you were saying.</v>

5430
02:42:54.741 --> 02:42:55.574
<v Speaker 5>I'm just gonna.</v>

5431
02:42:55.730 --> 02:42:56.563
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going hit anything.</v>

5432
02:42:56.610 --> 02:42:57.740
<v Speaker 5>Why'd you lose your sparkle?</v>

5433
02:42:58.250 --> 02:42:59.083
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

5434
02:43:00.320 --> 02:43:00.500
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

5435
02:43:00.500 --> 02:43:01.370
<v Speaker 5>this is what I'm saying.</v>

5436
02:43:01.820 --> 02:43:03.200
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a good weed smoker.</v>

5437
02:43:03.620 --> 02:43:04.220
<v Speaker 5>You're fine.</v>

5438
02:43:04.220 --> 02:43:05.120
<v Speaker 5>I think you're killing it.</v>

5439
02:43:05.300 --> 02:43:08.900
<v Speaker 5>I think you guys should talk and I should not put this on the Internet.</v>

5440
02:43:09.860 --> 02:43:10.693
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

5441
02:43:11.830 --> 02:43:11.980
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

5442
02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:13.090
<v Speaker 1>think it will be awesome.</v>

5443
02:43:14.050 --> 02:43:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Maybe in a second.</v>

5444
02:43:16.500 --> 02:43:19.820
<v Speaker 1>Fingerprints and Gods by Graham Hancock Gentlemen.</v>

5445
02:43:19.870 --> 02:43:24.130
<v Speaker 1>Fingerprints of the gods that's available as Amazon taking too much.</v>

5446
02:43:24.390 --> 02:43:24.910
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5447
02:43:24.910 --> 02:43:25.541
<v Speaker 1>it's Amazon.</v>

5448
02:43:25.541 --> 02:43:26.291
<v Speaker 1>Super fucked up,</v>

5449
02:43:26.291 --> 02:43:27.124
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

5450
02:43:27.220 --> 02:43:28.053
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5451
02:43:28.210 --> 02:43:28.511
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

5452
02:43:28.511 --> 02:43:28.991
<v Speaker 1>If it did,</v>

5453
02:43:28.991 --> 02:43:31.000
<v Speaker 1>it would they have missiles and tags?</v>

5454
02:43:31.600 --> 02:43:32.950
<v Speaker 1>Definitely not super fucked up.</v>

5455
02:43:33.430 --> 02:43:37.570
<v Speaker 1>I think you're looking at it like a scale of fucked up.</v>

5456
02:43:37.750 --> 02:43:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Amazon's nowhere near like super fucked up.</v>

5457
02:43:39.761 --> 02:43:41.290
<v Speaker 1>They're super convenient.</v>

5458
02:43:43.350 --> 02:43:44.310
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

5459
02:43:44.920 --> 02:43:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Are they running shit and chasing people out of the fucking business and like,</v>

5460
02:43:49.270 --> 02:43:51.370
<v Speaker 1>oh no man crushing things.</v>

5461
02:43:51.640 --> 02:43:52.660
<v Speaker 1>Is that what they're doing?</v>

5462
02:43:52.720 --> 02:43:53.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

5463
02:43:53.250 --> 02:43:53.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

5464
02:43:53.870 --> 02:43:56.030
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be a general result.</v>

5465
02:43:56.050 --> 02:43:56.861
<v Speaker 1>amazon.com.</v>

5466
02:43:56.861 --> 02:43:57.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5467
02:43:57.280 --> 02:43:57.731
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

5468
02:43:57.731 --> 02:43:59.530
<v Speaker 1>they make life so fucking convenience.</v>

5469
02:43:59.560 --> 02:44:00.460
<v Speaker 1>I put it.</v>

5470
02:44:00.461 --> 02:44:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Is that you're sacrificing anything else?</v>

5471
02:44:02.520 --> 02:44:03.353
<v Speaker 1>Cause I don't know.</v>

5472
02:44:03.400 --> 02:44:04.233
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

5473
02:44:04.330 --> 02:44:04.661
<v Speaker 5>Depends,</v>

5474
02:44:04.661 --> 02:44:05.301
<v Speaker 5>I mean like the,</v>

5475
02:44:05.301 --> 02:44:06.850
<v Speaker 5>the people that they're sort of,</v>

5476
02:44:06.940 --> 02:44:07.773
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

5477
02:44:07.990 --> 02:44:08.420
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5478
02:44:08.420 --> 02:44:10.720
<v Speaker 5>affecting or like the big business like target,</v>

5479
02:44:10.780 --> 02:44:11.151
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5480
02:44:11.151 --> 02:44:11.511
<v Speaker 5>or,</v>

5481
02:44:11.511 --> 02:44:13.180
<v Speaker 5>or whatever.</v>

5482
02:44:13.181 --> 02:44:13.531
<v Speaker 5>Like you,</v>

5483
02:44:13.531 --> 02:44:14.920
<v Speaker 5>you can buy your toilet paper,</v>

5484
02:44:14.921 --> 02:44:15.731
<v Speaker 5>your dish soap,</v>

5485
02:44:15.731 --> 02:44:15.941
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

5486
02:44:15.941 --> 02:44:18.430
<v Speaker 5>your laundry detergent on Amazon.</v>

5487
02:44:18.431 --> 02:44:19.570
<v Speaker 5>You're both show about two days.</v>

5488
02:44:19.571 --> 02:44:21.460
<v Speaker 5>What about the small Internet vendors?</v>

5489
02:44:21.461 --> 02:44:21.641
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5490
02:44:21.641 --> 02:44:22.860
<v Speaker 5>it's like you're talking about all these other,</v>

5491
02:44:22.861 --> 02:44:24.160
<v Speaker 5>it's not that tailored.</v>

5492
02:44:24.161 --> 02:44:24.821
<v Speaker 5>Like it doesn't,</v>

5493
02:44:24.821 --> 02:44:25.900
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't have like,</v>

5494
02:44:26.050 --> 02:44:26.883
<v Speaker 5>if you want.</v>

5495
02:44:26.900 --> 02:44:28.930
<v Speaker 5>So sometimes there's like intricate,</v>

5496
02:44:29.280 --> 02:44:29.890
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

5497
02:44:29.890 --> 02:44:30.311
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

5498
02:44:30.311 --> 02:44:32.290
<v Speaker 5>fucking vitamin supplements or whatever.</v>

5499
02:44:32.680 --> 02:44:35.170
<v Speaker 5>But for the most part it's the,</v>

5500
02:44:35.450 --> 02:44:36.283
<v Speaker 5>are you okay?</v>

5501
02:44:36.380 --> 02:44:36.591
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

5502
02:44:36.591 --> 02:44:37.424
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

5503
02:44:39.140 --> 02:44:39.321
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5504
02:44:39.321 --> 02:44:39.471
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5505
02:44:39.471 --> 02:44:39.701
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

5506
02:44:39.701 --> 02:44:42.920
<v Speaker 1>I'd be massaging my fucking control.</v>

5507
02:44:44.090 --> 02:44:45.970
<v Speaker 1>But this is kind of the tip of Tony Nipples.</v>

5508
02:44:46.430 --> 02:44:46.880
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

5509
02:44:46.880 --> 02:44:47.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if,</v>

5510
02:44:47.990 --> 02:44:49.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if Amazon,</v>

5511
02:44:49.340 --> 02:44:49.611
<v Speaker 1>honey,</v>

5512
02:44:49.611 --> 02:44:49.851
<v Speaker 1>honey,</v>

5513
02:44:49.851 --> 02:44:50.684
<v Speaker 1>hi.</v>

5514
02:44:51.260 --> 02:44:52.400
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what's going to happen.</v>

5515
02:44:52.430 --> 02:44:53.450
<v Speaker 1>We're fine.</v>

5516
02:44:53.510 --> 02:44:55.030
<v Speaker 1>We're almost home.</v>

5517
02:44:56.870 --> 02:44:58.010
<v Speaker 1>We're amongst friends.</v>

5518
02:44:58.150 --> 02:44:59.270
<v Speaker 1>You've got Jesus Christ.</v>

5519
02:44:59.890 --> 02:45:00.231
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

5520
02:45:00.231 --> 02:45:02.120
<v Speaker 1>maybe it was too much of a question.</v>

5521
02:45:02.210 --> 02:45:02.450
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

5522
02:45:02.450 --> 02:45:03.530
<v Speaker 1>can I go back to Amazon?</v>

5523
02:45:03.680 --> 02:45:04.513
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>

5524
02:45:04.760 --> 02:45:06.110
<v Speaker 5>I think Amazon is amazing.</v>

5525
02:45:06.390 --> 02:45:09.290
<v Speaker 5>So it kind of takes a little,</v>

5526
02:45:09.760 --> 02:45:10.593
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5527
02:45:10.670 --> 02:45:13.040
<v Speaker 5>dig at the big business for,</v>

5528
02:45:13.110 --> 02:45:15.290
<v Speaker 5>for convenience purposes.</v>

5529
02:45:15.291 --> 02:45:16.011
<v Speaker 5>If you have prime,</v>

5530
02:45:16.011 --> 02:45:16.221
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5531
02:45:16.221 --> 02:45:17.750
<v Speaker 5>you can get all the shit in two days,</v>

5532
02:45:17.990 --> 02:45:18.531
<v Speaker 5>but it's not,</v>

5533
02:45:18.531 --> 02:45:20.000
<v Speaker 5>it's not like you can get,</v>

5534
02:45:20.050 --> 02:45:20.883
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

5535
02:45:21.280 --> 02:45:24.830
<v Speaker 5>like an intricate tailored item that you need for the most part.</v>

5536
02:45:25.420 --> 02:45:26.180
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

5537
02:45:26.180 --> 02:45:27.070
<v Speaker 1>I guess that makes sense.</v>

5538
02:45:27.100 --> 02:45:30.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily think it cuts out business as much.</v>

5539
02:45:31.330 --> 02:45:32.500
<v Speaker 1>It's not comparable.</v>

5540
02:45:32.950 --> 02:45:35.740
<v Speaker 1>They're very efficient and it's convenient for people,</v>

5541
02:45:36.880 --> 02:45:38.740
<v Speaker 1>but they kind of have a monopoly on the,</v>

5542
02:45:38.741 --> 02:45:38.981
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

5543
02:45:38.981 --> 02:45:41.340
<v Speaker 1>we're going to ship shit for you today.</v>

5544
02:45:41.630 --> 02:45:41.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5545
02:45:41.980 --> 02:45:43.300
<v Speaker 1>do they have a monopoly?</v>

5546
02:45:44.100 --> 02:45:45.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they do.</v>

5547
02:45:45.581 --> 02:45:49.540
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people sell things on the Internet.</v>

5548
02:45:49.570 --> 02:45:54.430
<v Speaker 1>Here's what I was just really good at figuring out that you know you can make it</v>

5549
02:45:54.431 --> 02:45:55.570
<v Speaker 1>super convenient.</v>

5550
02:45:55.571 --> 02:45:56.351
<v Speaker 1>You one click.</v>

5551
02:45:56.351 --> 02:45:59.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're one of the few companies that started that.</v>

5552
02:45:59.080 --> 02:45:59.231
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5553
02:45:59.231 --> 02:46:00.610
<v Speaker 1>Here's why I think it's the monopoly though.</v>

5554
02:46:00.760 --> 02:46:01.600
<v Speaker 1>And this is just for me.</v>

5555
02:46:01.690 --> 02:46:04.120
<v Speaker 1>Can you think of one other company that does the same thing?</v>

5556
02:46:04.810 --> 02:46:05.830
<v Speaker 1>You're on Amazon.</v>

5557
02:46:06.170 --> 02:46:07.300
<v Speaker 1>You sell your shit on them.</v>

5558
02:46:14.960 --> 02:46:17.000
<v Speaker 1>They just dropped the price.</v>

5559
02:46:19.980 --> 02:46:20.813
<v Speaker 1>Great service</v>

5560
02:46:22.550 --> 02:46:23.383
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

5561
02:46:25.260 --> 02:46:25.790
<v Speaker 1>to them.</v>

5562
02:46:25.790 --> 02:46:26.623
<v Speaker 1>I love Amazon.</v>

5563
02:46:26.770 --> 02:46:28.910
<v Speaker 1>I get like if I get drunk at night,</v>

5564
02:46:28.911 --> 02:46:31.080
<v Speaker 1>like just kidding.</v>

5565
02:46:31.370 --> 02:46:33.310
<v Speaker 1>I will just order shoots to Amazon.</v>

5566
02:46:33.940 --> 02:46:34.773
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

5567
02:46:35.260 --> 02:46:35.951
<v Speaker 3>What are you asking?</v>

5568
02:46:35.951 --> 02:46:36.784
<v Speaker 3>Do you have a question?</v>

5569
02:46:37.080 --> 02:46:37.320
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5570
02:46:37.320 --> 02:46:37.751
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

5571
02:46:37.751 --> 02:46:38.171
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>

5572
02:46:38.171 --> 02:46:39.810
<v Speaker 3>I already asked it anyway.</v>

5573
02:46:41.200 --> 02:46:42.033
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>

5574
02:46:42.310 --> 02:46:43.300
<v Speaker 3>It's nothing wrong with it.</v>

5575
02:46:43.301 --> 02:46:44.320
<v Speaker 3>They're just the best at it.</v>

5576
02:46:45.310 --> 02:46:46.630
<v Speaker 3>They're great order.</v>

5577
02:46:46.690 --> 02:46:49.150
<v Speaker 3>They send your shit if you can't keep up.</v>

5578
02:46:50.350 --> 02:46:52.900
<v Speaker 3>Now there's Alibaba so that might change shit.</v>

5579
02:46:53.170 --> 02:46:53.920
<v Speaker 3>What's that?</v>

5580
02:46:53.920 --> 02:46:56.110
<v Speaker 3>Alibaba is like the Amazon.</v>

5581
02:46:58.910 --> 02:47:00.470
<v Speaker 1>How do I not know something that you know?</v>

5582
02:47:00.920 --> 02:47:02.320
<v Speaker 1>I've heard about Ali Baba</v>

5583
02:47:02.430 --> 02:47:03.370
<v Speaker 6>cause I was passing.</v>

5584
02:47:03.520 --> 02:47:05.680
<v Speaker 6>This is how much I think life is a simulation.</v>

5585
02:47:05.940 --> 02:47:09.310
<v Speaker 6>I was passing by this newspaper Rack and there's this dude and I was like,</v>

5586
02:47:09.311 --> 02:47:09.971
<v Speaker 6>Alibaba,</v>

5587
02:47:09.971 --> 02:47:11.710
<v Speaker 6>now worth more than Google.</v>

5588
02:47:11.711 --> 02:47:12.461
<v Speaker 6>Facebook.</v>

5589
02:47:12.461 --> 02:47:14.410
<v Speaker 6>They just publicly traded company in the world.</v>

5590
02:47:16.120 --> 02:47:18.370
<v Speaker 6>And I was walking by,</v>

5591
02:47:18.550 --> 02:47:18.881
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

5592
02:47:18.881 --> 02:47:20.050
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck am I doing?</v>

5593
02:47:20.051 --> 02:47:20.884
<v Speaker 6>Like what am I,</v>

5594
02:47:20.890 --> 02:47:21.723
<v Speaker 6>what is this?</v>

5595
02:47:21.880 --> 02:47:24.280
<v Speaker 6>Am I looking at what the fuck is Alibaba?</v>

5596
02:47:24.500 --> 02:47:25.420
<v Speaker 3>It's like an uh,</v>

5597
02:47:26.440 --> 02:47:29.390
<v Speaker 3>maybe not Townsend's side project.</v>

5598
02:47:29.391 --> 02:47:30.224
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>

5599
02:47:31.010 --> 02:47:31.910
<v Speaker 3>what is Alibaba?</v>

5600
02:47:32.900 --> 02:47:34.040
<v Speaker 3>As far as I understand it,</v>

5601
02:47:34.230 --> 02:47:35.063
<v Speaker 3>it's a movie.</v>

5602
02:47:37.360 --> 02:47:38.780
<v Speaker 3>Do you know Alibaba?</v>

5603
02:47:38.800 --> 02:47:39.300
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

5604
02:47:39.300 --> 02:47:39.800
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

5605
02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:41.330
<v Speaker 3>that startup that made like,</v>

5606
02:47:41.540 --> 02:47:44.180
<v Speaker 3>it's like an Asian equivalent of Amazon,</v>

5607
02:47:44.420 --> 02:47:44.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5608
02:47:44.930 --> 02:47:48.750
<v Speaker 3>they facilitate businesses trading with consumer anyway.</v>

5609
02:47:48.751 --> 02:47:49.001
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

5610
02:47:49.001 --> 02:47:50.870
<v Speaker 3>So it's like a Amazon for China.</v>

5611
02:47:51.150 --> 02:47:51.983
<v Speaker 3>What you do is you,</v>

5612
02:47:52.110 --> 02:47:55.460
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're hiring companies to do things for you.</v>

5613
02:47:55.461 --> 02:48:00.461
<v Speaker 3>So like if you want like a thousand like wallets with your face on it,</v>

5614
02:48:00.771 --> 02:48:02.110
<v Speaker 3>you can con con</v>

5615
02:48:03.880 --> 02:48:05.300
<v Speaker 3>it's a manufacturer.</v>

5616
02:48:05.350 --> 02:48:05.500
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5617
02:48:05.500 --> 02:48:05.730
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5618
02:48:05.730 --> 02:48:05.861
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

5619
02:48:05.861 --> 02:48:06.090
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

5620
02:48:06.090 --> 02:48:10.370
<v Speaker 3>they just the second directory of manufacturers or like a distribution network.</v>

5621
02:48:11.710 --> 02:48:12.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5622
02:48:12.460 --> 02:48:13.730
<v Speaker 3>And it's basically,</v>

5623
02:48:13.790 --> 02:48:15.110
<v Speaker 3>it's similar to Amazon,</v>

5624
02:48:15.111 --> 02:48:18.060
<v Speaker 3>but it's just gotten so big and because China's such a huge market,</v>

5625
02:48:18.120 --> 02:48:22.550
<v Speaker 3>it just went global and it's at least at the time that it was going out,</v>

5626
02:48:22.580 --> 02:48:24.290
<v Speaker 3>the biggest globally traded co,</v>

5627
02:48:24.291 --> 02:48:26.570
<v Speaker 3>it was going to be on the precipice of that.</v>

5628
02:48:27.940 --> 02:48:28.773
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

5629
02:48:29.470 --> 02:48:32.070
<v Speaker 6>When you think about the numbers of people to go with it,</v>

5630
02:48:32.080 --> 02:48:33.370
<v Speaker 6>the Asian market is like,</v>

5631
02:48:33.730 --> 02:48:35.290
<v Speaker 6>think about how many people were in China.</v>

5632
02:48:35.291 --> 02:48:36.910
<v Speaker 6>It's like a billion plus,</v>

5633
02:48:36.911 --> 02:48:37.240
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

5634
02:48:37.240 --> 02:48:38.290
<v Speaker 6>1.6 billion.</v>

5635
02:48:38.291 --> 02:48:39.041
<v Speaker 6>Something like God is,</v>

5636
02:48:39.041 --> 02:48:39.874
<v Speaker 6>it's that high.</v>

5637
02:48:41.190 --> 02:48:42.023
<v Speaker 6>Is that real?</v>

5638
02:48:42.420 --> 02:48:44.660
<v Speaker 6>Would probably more than probably more than that.</v>

5639
02:48:45.220 --> 02:48:49.090
<v Speaker 6>So like close to a million,</v>

5640
02:48:49.091 --> 02:48:50.890
<v Speaker 6>like say to hunt,</v>

02:48:55.110 --> 02:48:57.420
<v Speaker 3>a thousand million plus another 600 million.</v>

02:50:15.780 --> 02:50:18.270
<v Speaker 4>We're a swarm with us a lot,</v>

5697
02:50:20.730 --> 02:50:23.580
<v Speaker 4>so as the low hanging fruit,</v>

5698
02:50:23.640 --> 02:50:24.570
<v Speaker 4>I mean that was obvious.</v>

02:50:24.690 --> 02:50:27.610
<v Speaker 4>There was a fucking lot of us people,</v>

02:50:28.620 --> 02:50:30.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's still plenty of space.</v>

5702
02:50:30.481 --> 02:50:33.180
<v Speaker 4>Don't get is why some of us,</v>

02:50:37.450 --> 02:50:38.720
<v Speaker 4>called cult are ready.</v>

5706
02:50:39.700 --> 02:50:40.381
<v Speaker 4>It starts out,</v>

5707
02:50:40.381 --> 02:50:43.180
<v Speaker 4>you call a common and your chickens and your hunting excursion.</v>

5708
02:50:43.181 --> 02:50:44.430
<v Speaker 4>The police call it a cult.</v>

5709
02:50:46.050 --> 02:50:46.561
<v Speaker 4>Chickens.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Chickens are great.</v>

5712
02:50:50.880 --> 02:50:54.240
<v Speaker 4>I think that would be like one of the best things you could do other than plant</v>

5713
02:50:54.241 --> 02:50:54.841
<v Speaker 4>vegetables.</v>

5714
02:50:54.841 --> 02:50:55.860
<v Speaker 4>Plant vegetables.</v>

5715
02:50:55.890 --> 02:50:57.030
<v Speaker 4>Equally satisfying.</v>

5716
02:50:57.060 --> 02:50:58.380
<v Speaker 4>It's a beautiful vegetable.</v>

5717
02:50:58.440 --> 02:50:59.273
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5718
02:50:59.790 --> 02:51:03.690
<v Speaker 4>it's cool to be able to pick vegetables out of the ground.</v>

5719
02:51:03.930 --> 02:51:04.201
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5720
02:51:04.201 --> 02:51:05.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't do enough of it.</v>

5721
02:51:05.251 --> 02:51:07.110
<v Speaker 4>I would like to do all of my vegetables,</v>

5722
02:51:07.111 --> 02:51:08.760
<v Speaker 4>like planted garden vegetables.</v>

5723
02:51:08.761 --> 02:51:10.830
<v Speaker 4>I just think that'd be like the coolest thing to be,</v>

5724
02:51:11.070 --> 02:51:15.060
<v Speaker 4>have like a complete direct relationship with all the food you eat.</v>

5725
02:51:15.480 --> 02:51:15.870
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

5726
02:51:15.870 --> 02:51:16.703
<v Speaker 4>That would be amazing.</v>

5727
02:51:17.310 --> 02:51:17.700
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

5728
02:51:17.700 --> 02:51:18.960
<v Speaker 4>what are the missing?</v>

5729
02:51:18.961 --> 02:51:19.794
<v Speaker 4>That right.</v>

5730
02:51:19.870 --> 02:51:21.990
<v Speaker 4>We'll give you eat a chicken or you like thank you.</v>

5731
02:51:25.100 --> 02:51:27.060
<v Speaker 4>Don't have that kind of relationship with chicken.</v>

5732
02:51:27.910 --> 02:51:29.670
<v Speaker 4>I don't pretend the dietary needs.</v>

5733
02:51:29.970 --> 02:51:30.803
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

5734
02:51:31.260 --> 02:51:32.340

02:51:33.881 --> 02:51:34.740
<v Speaker 4>I just go lizard,</v>

5738
02:51:34.800 --> 02:51:35.191

5739
02:51:35.191 --> 02:51:36.590
<v Speaker 4>part of the brain shrimping.</v>

5740
02:51:36.660 --> 02:51:38.430
<v Speaker 4>Just mentally.</v>

5741
02:51:38.460 --> 02:51:38.701
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

5742
02:51:38.701 --> 02:51:39.780
<v Speaker 4>If you're going to kill a chicken,</v>

5743
02:51:39.781 --> 02:51:40.320
<v Speaker 4>you just,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Can't have a lot of compassion.</v>

5747
02:51:44.330 --> 02:51:46.330
<v Speaker 4>So yeah.</v>

5748
02:51:46.950 --> 02:51:47.783
<v Speaker 4>Honestly,</v>

5749
02:51:47.820 --> 02:51:50.700
<v Speaker 4>as far as like the spirit animal connections go,</v>

5750
02:51:51.060 --> 02:51:52.800
<v Speaker 4>chickens don't feel connected to them.</v>

5751
02:51:52.801 --> 02:51:53.634
<v Speaker 4>Cows,</v>

5752

<v Speaker 4>goats.</v>

5754
02:51:55.900 --> 02:51:57.420
<v Speaker 4>It's a different thing with mammals.</v>

5755
02:52:00.120 --> 02:52:00.953
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5756
02:52:01.050 --> 02:52:02.100
<v Speaker 4>chickens are weird.</v>

5757
02:52:02.190 --> 02:52:04.410
<v Speaker 4>They're dinosaurs are a strange bird.</v>

5758
02:52:04.411 --> 02:52:05.980
<v Speaker 4>That probably doesn't</v>

5759
02:52:05.980 --> 02:52:06.813
<v Speaker 1>make sense.</v>

5760
02:52:07.560 --> 02:52:09.220
<v Speaker 1>You don't fucking fly.</v>

5761
02:52:09.310 --> 02:52:11.920
<v Speaker 1>We're keeping them around where the reason they're around.</v>

5766
02:52:17.980 --> 02:52:18.813
<v Speaker 1>Why are you doing that?</v>

5767
02:52:18.820 --> 02:52:19.830
<v Speaker 1>So if you wanted it to play anymore,</v>

03:06:26.260 --> 03:06:26.810
<v Speaker 1>too big.</v>

6175
03:06:26.810 --> 03:06:27.643
<v Speaker 1>It's too great.</v>

6176
03:06:27.710 --> 03:06:30.770
<v Speaker 1>That was should we should fine.</v>

6177
03:06:31.520 --> 03:06:33.440
<v Speaker 1>Particularly rural friends.</v>

6178
03:06:34.500 --> 03:06:35.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to keep forging ahead with this.</v>

6179
03:06:35.901 --> 03:06:36.734
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what</v>

6180
03:06:41.320 --> 03:06:41.541
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>

6181
03:06:41.541 --> 03:06:42.200
<v Speaker 1>The Internet,</v>

6182
03:06:42.200 --> 03:06:43.480
<v Speaker 1>what she just said about,</v>

6183
03:06:43.481 --> 03:06:44.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6184
03:06:44.240 --> 03:06:45.590
<v Speaker 1>the well of creativity.</v>

6185
03:06:45.650 --> 03:06:50.450
<v Speaker 1>The exciting point to me about that is it's all the same thing.</v>

6186
03:06:50.451 --> 03:06:50.991
<v Speaker 1>It's the same.</v>

6187
03:06:50.991 --> 03:06:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Well and the only difference then is just some sort of technical aspect.</v>

6188
03:06:55.320 --> 03:06:56.153
<v Speaker 1>Did you learn</v>

6189
03:06:56.520 --> 03:06:57.330
<v Speaker 6>to do stand up?</v>

6190
03:06:57.330 --> 03:06:58.770
<v Speaker 6>Did you learn to play the guitar?</v>

6191
03:06:59.040 --> 03:07:00.030
<v Speaker 6>Did you learn to make movies?</v>

6192
03:07:00.050 --> 03:07:00.270
<v Speaker 6>It,</v>

6193
03:07:00.270 --> 03:07:01.500
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't make a difference,</v>

6194
03:07:02.310 --> 03:07:02.581
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

6195
03:07:02.581 --> 03:07:02.971
<v Speaker 6>at that.</v>

6196
03:07:02.971 --> 03:07:07.910
<v Speaker 6>That's just like what the path of your creativity flows through for the rest of</v>

6197
03:07:07.911 --> 03:07:11.740
<v Speaker 6>your painting or whether it's your music or whether it's your,</v>

6198
03:07:11.760 --> 03:07:12.431
<v Speaker 6>whatever it is,</v>

6199
03:07:12.431 --> 03:07:12.750
<v Speaker 6>the path,</v>

6200
03:07:12.750 --> 03:07:14.160
<v Speaker 6>the path of your creativity,</v>

6201
03:07:14.161 --> 03:07:15.120
<v Speaker 6>whatever it flows through.</v>

6202
03:07:16.040 --> 03:07:16.450
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

6203
03:07:16.450 --> 03:07:16.781
<v Speaker 6>And it's,</v>

6204
03:07:16.781 --> 03:07:19.110
<v Speaker 6>it's like a raw technical element and that's it.</v>

6205
03:07:19.230 --> 03:07:23.340
<v Speaker 6>So what really matters is where you're coming from from that well perspective.</v>

6206
03:07:23.460 --> 03:07:24.293
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

6207
03:07:24.720 --> 03:07:25.141
<v Speaker 6>maybe,</v>

6208
03:07:25.141 --> 03:07:27.090
<v Speaker 6>but I mean that's the other thing is that like,</v>

6209
03:07:27.120 --> 03:07:32.120
<v Speaker 6>I feel like certain people are just drawn to certain certain type of activities,</v>

6210
03:07:33.720 --> 03:07:35.310
<v Speaker 6>certain disciplines,</v>

6211
03:07:35.311 --> 03:07:36.090
<v Speaker 6>certain things.</v>

6212
03:07:36.090 --> 03:07:37.710
<v Speaker 6>And when they resist that,</v>

6213
03:07:38.370 --> 03:07:40.810
<v Speaker 6>there's like huge issues with humans crease.</v>

6214
03:07:40.830 --> 03:07:41.730
<v Speaker 6>But I totally,</v>

6215
03:07:41.970 --> 03:07:43.890
<v Speaker 6>that's exactly what we were talking about earlier.</v>

6216
03:07:44.370 --> 03:07:47.730
<v Speaker 6>And it's like a huge loss of confidence for people suppression.</v>

6217
03:07:47.980 --> 03:07:48.230
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

6218
03:07:48.230 --> 03:07:48.660
<v Speaker 6>you just,</v>

6219
03:07:48.660 --> 03:07:50.010
<v Speaker 6>you feel bad.</v>

6220
03:07:50.040 --> 03:07:55.040
<v Speaker 6>You feel like it's almost like there's a just grand puzzle going on and you,</v>

6221
03:07:56.160 --> 03:07:56.701
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

6222
03:07:56.701 --> 03:07:58.860
<v Speaker 6>you just kinda like going towards which,</v>

6223
03:07:59.030 --> 03:08:02.730
<v Speaker 6>what's pulling you and is it healthy that it's pulling you in this direction?</v>

6224
03:08:02.731 --> 03:08:03.900
<v Speaker 6>Like examine it,</v>

6225
03:08:03.930 --> 03:08:04.591
<v Speaker 6>figure it out,</v>

6226
03:08:04.591 --> 03:08:05.424
<v Speaker 6>figure out what it is,</v>

6227
03:08:05.460 --> 03:08:07.010
<v Speaker 6>and if you could resist it because you're,</v>

6228
03:08:07.050 --> 03:08:07.321
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

6229
03:08:07.321 --> 03:08:09.480
<v Speaker 6>it's not a sure thing or it's not,</v>

6230
03:08:09.810 --> 03:08:10.620
<v Speaker 6>how do you feel about that</v>

6231
03:08:10.620 --> 03:08:12.300
<v Speaker 5>conformity then in that respect?</v>

6232
03:08:12.301 --> 03:08:12.930
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

6233
03:08:12.930 --> 03:08:14.640
<v Speaker 5>like you being Joe,</v>

6234
03:08:14.670 --> 03:08:14.941
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6235
03:08:14.941 --> 03:08:17.880
<v Speaker 5>and then you're in certain social settings or whatever.</v>

6236
03:08:18.120 --> 03:08:18.953
<v Speaker 5>Do you,</v>

6237
03:08:19.230 --> 03:08:19.910
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

6238
03:08:19.910 --> 03:08:20.550
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6239
03:08:20.550 --> 03:08:21.540
<v Speaker 5>are you malleable?</v>

6240
03:08:21.780 --> 03:08:24.030
<v Speaker 5>Can you change into a way that like,</v>

6241
03:08:24.480 --> 03:08:25.021
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

6242
03:08:25.021 --> 03:08:25.321
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>

6243
03:08:25.321 --> 03:08:26.220
<v Speaker 5>I'm with this crowd,</v>

6244
03:08:26.221 --> 03:08:26.900
<v Speaker 5>or</v>

6245
03:08:26.900 --> 03:08:27.081
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

6246
03:08:27.081 --> 03:08:27.550
<v Speaker 6>I can talk,</v>

6247
03:08:27.550 --> 03:08:28.371
<v Speaker 6>I can talk to anybody.</v>

6248
03:08:28.371 --> 03:08:28.511
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

6249
03:08:28.511 --> 03:08:28.650
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

6250
03:08:28.650 --> 03:08:31.900
<v Speaker 6>I sit in a room full of born again Christians and have a friendly conversation</v>

6251
03:08:31.910 --> 03:08:32.743
<v Speaker 6>with them.</v>

6252
03:08:32.840 --> 03:08:34.850
<v Speaker 6>I probably couldn't have a decade ago.</v>

6253
03:08:35.120 --> 03:08:35.690
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

6254
03:08:35.690 --> 03:08:40.430
<v Speaker 6>But somewhere along the line I've realized it doesn't matter if you're right or</v>

6255
03:08:40.431 --> 03:08:41.264
<v Speaker 6>I'm right.</v>

6256
03:08:41.370 --> 03:08:41.660
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

6257
03:08:41.660 --> 03:08:42.950
<v Speaker 6>it's not a fucking game.</v>

6258
03:08:43.250 --> 03:08:44.030
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

6259
03:08:44.030 --> 03:08:47.000
<v Speaker 6>And so instead of quantifying it as a game,</v>

6260
03:08:47.030 --> 03:08:49.850
<v Speaker 6>which is like a thing that guys love to do,</v>

6261
03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:51.020
<v Speaker 6>we love to do it.</v>

6262
03:08:51.021 --> 03:08:51.950
<v Speaker 6>We want to be right.</v>

6263
03:08:52.340 --> 03:08:53.173
<v Speaker 6>People love to do.</v>

6264
03:08:53.210 --> 03:08:54.080
<v Speaker 6>People love to do it.</v>

6265
03:08:54.081 --> 03:08:57.590
<v Speaker 6>But guys specifically because guys likes me feel better,</v>

6266
03:08:57.800 --> 03:08:59.930
<v Speaker 6>guys like the fucking win arguments,</v>

6267
03:08:59.990 --> 03:09:00.770
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

6268
03:09:00.770 --> 03:09:02.430
<v Speaker 6>it's a barbarian thing.</v>

6269
03:09:02.431 --> 03:09:03.620
<v Speaker 6>It's some fucking weird,</v>

6270
03:09:03.740 --> 03:09:04.573
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

6271
03:09:05.690 --> 03:09:06.051
<v Speaker 6>pubs,</v>

6272
03:09:06.051 --> 03:09:06.771
<v Speaker 6>sword fight,</v>

6273
03:09:06.771 --> 03:09:10.160
<v Speaker 6>shit leftover from the fucking dark ages.</v>

6274
03:09:10.390 --> 03:09:11.140
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

6275
03:09:11.140 --> 03:09:12.190
<v Speaker 5>So sorry.</v>

6276
03:09:12.250 --> 03:09:12.611
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

6277
03:09:12.611 --> 03:09:14.410
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it's a gender specific thing.</v>

6278
03:09:14.411 --> 03:09:16.210
<v Speaker 5>I think sometimes you just want to connect with people.</v>

6279
03:09:16.211 --> 03:09:18.340
<v Speaker 5>It's not so much about dudes and,</v>

6280
03:09:18.440 --> 03:09:19.211
<v Speaker 5>or ladies,</v>

6281
03:09:19.211 --> 03:09:19.511
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6282
03:09:19.511 --> 03:09:23.740
<v Speaker 5>I think I used to feel really guilty about being able to conform so easily</v>

6283
03:09:23.741 --> 03:09:24.760
<v Speaker 5>because I love everybody.</v>

6284
03:09:25.090 --> 03:09:25.860
<v Speaker 5>Cause I,</v>

6285
03:09:25.860 --> 03:09:26.220
<v Speaker 5>I would,</v>

6286
03:09:26.220 --> 03:09:26.950
<v Speaker 5>I can,</v>

6287
03:09:26.950 --> 03:09:28.390
<v Speaker 5>I can hang out all the time.</v>

6288
03:09:28.391 --> 03:09:29.020
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

6289
03:09:29.020 --> 03:09:29.681
<v Speaker 5>and then I was like,</v>

6290
03:09:29.681 --> 03:09:31.960
<v Speaker 5>well why did I just like exploit myself?</v>

6291
03:09:31.961 --> 03:09:32.100
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

6292
03:09:32.100 --> 03:09:34.450
<v Speaker 5>Exploit parts of myself to fit in here,</v>

6293
03:09:34.510 --> 03:09:35.343
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

6294
03:09:35.560 --> 03:09:37.030
<v Speaker 5>But at the same time,</v>

6295
03:09:37.600 --> 03:09:40.030
<v Speaker 5>I think it's okay to just be,</v>

6296
03:09:40.090 --> 03:09:40.630
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

6297
03:09:40.630 --> 03:09:44.290
<v Speaker 5>have accessible aspects of yourself to connect with people.</v>

6298
03:09:44.550 --> 03:09:44.791
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

6299
03:09:44.791 --> 03:09:45.420
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

6300
03:09:45.420 --> 03:09:46.110
<v Speaker 6>absolutely.</v>

6301
03:09:46.110 --> 03:09:46.380
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

6302
03:09:46.380 --> 03:09:47.690
<v Speaker 6>are you going to occasionally run it?</v>

6303
03:09:48.060 --> 03:09:48.270
<v Speaker 6>That's</v>

6304
03:09:48.270 --> 03:09:49.230
<v Speaker 5>like a male.</v>

6305
03:09:49.680 --> 03:09:51.810
<v Speaker 5>I think that's across the board.</v>

6306
03:09:52.170 --> 03:09:52.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6307
03:09:52.530 --> 03:09:52.711
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

6308
03:09:52.711 --> 03:09:53.590
<v Speaker 5>that's across the board.</v>

6309
03:09:53.680 --> 03:09:54.150
<v Speaker 5>I agree</v>

6310
03:09:54.150 --> 03:09:56.020
<v Speaker 4>with what you just said it.</v>

6311
03:09:56.900 --> 03:09:57.790
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

6312
03:09:58.060 --> 03:10:01.810
<v Speaker 4>I dunno the being argumentative or like,</v>

6313
03:10:02.200 --> 03:10:04.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean women driving towards conflict,</v>

6314
03:10:04.510 --> 03:10:06.610
<v Speaker 4>man are women are we all are,</v>

6315
03:10:06.611 --> 03:10:06.970
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

6316
03:10:06.970 --> 03:10:07.331
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

6317
03:10:07.331 --> 03:10:09.070
<v Speaker 4>it's not really gender dependent.</v>

6318
03:10:09.110 --> 03:10:09.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

6319
03:10:09.490 --> 03:10:14.350
<v Speaker 4>but I think there's a extra like sort of dominated or trait that a lot of men</v>

6320
03:10:14.530 --> 03:10:15.400
<v Speaker 4>tend to have,</v>

6321
03:10:15.730 --> 03:10:16.031
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6322
03:10:16.031 --> 03:10:17.950
<v Speaker 4>that want them to win arguments,</v>

6323
03:10:17.951 --> 03:10:19.540
<v Speaker 4>especially when this podcast,</v>

6324
03:10:20.820 --> 03:10:21.100
<v Speaker 4>how do you,</v>

6325
03:10:21.100 --> 03:10:24.970
<v Speaker 4>when it is this kind of game planning,</v>

6326
03:10:24.971 --> 03:10:27.590
<v Speaker 4>like the dominant one guys will all that.</v>

6327
03:10:27.820 --> 03:10:29.350
<v Speaker 4>I feel like we're all winning his pocket.</v>

6328
03:10:29.440 --> 03:10:31.410
<v Speaker 4>I like the way you talk.</v>

6329

<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

6348
03:11:01.790 --> 03:11:02.440

03:11:24.550 --> 03:11:25.510
<v Speaker 4>not racist.</v>

6358
