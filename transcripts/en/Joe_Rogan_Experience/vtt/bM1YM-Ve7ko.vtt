<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

8
00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:04.551

10
00:00:04.971 --> 00:00:05.571

<v Speaker 1>come you like,</v>

12
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.350
<v Speaker 2>I liked family tides.</v>

13
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even fucking around.</v>

14
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.330
<v Speaker 2>Like I liked family ties.</v>

15
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.140
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

16
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.840
<v Speaker 2>but that's about d like two and a half men.</v>

17
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:16.951
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

18
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:19.050
<v Speaker 2>I'll say this for two and a half men.</v>

19
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.140
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it on mute a few times on the plane and it looks like they're having a</v>

20
00:00:24.781 --> 00:00:25.614
<v Speaker 2>good time.</v>

21
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.960
<v Speaker 2>Then maybe the best answer anyone has ever to their questions.</v>

22
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.070
<v Speaker 2>And then occasionally I'll hear like a Dick joke and I'm always like,</v>

23
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:37.440
<v Speaker 2>that's a pretty strong dick joke for the,</v>

24
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.821
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

25
00:00:37.821 --> 00:00:39.420
<v Speaker 2>for a sitcom at that time slot.</v>

26
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.920
<v Speaker 1>I only watched it once recently and I thought it was the most unbearable thing</v>

27
00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:45.620
<v Speaker 1>I'd ever seen on television and I thought it was incredible that it's so</v>

28
00:00:45.621 --> 00:00:46.220
<v Speaker 1>popular.</v>

29
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.210
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about it yesterday.</v>

30
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.351
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

31
00:00:47.351 --> 00:00:47.621
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

32
00:00:47.621 --> 00:00:47.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

33
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.770
<v Speaker 1>I was baffled by it.</v>

34
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.350
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe how bad the jokes were.</v>

35
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:52.131
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

36
00:00:52.131 --> 00:00:52.820
<v Speaker 1>this is just,</v>

37
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.620
<v Speaker 1>this is just an alien language,</v>

38
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:54.981
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

39
00:00:54.981 --> 00:00:57.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm watching it with my mouth open and I'm hearing the laugh track and I'm like,</v>

40
00:00:57.741 --> 00:00:59.000
<v Speaker 1>this isn't even my language.</v>

41
00:00:59.001 --> 00:00:59.640
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck?</v>

42
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.280
<v Speaker 1>If you don't watch your show with a laugh track for a while and then you do it,</v>

43
00:01:03.281 --> 00:01:03.990
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

44
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.550
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

45
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.960
<v Speaker 1>I would like to watch it and have it all the laughs extracted like someone do it</v>

46
00:01:08.961 --> 00:01:09.860
<v Speaker 1>through pro tools,</v>

47
00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:10.311
<v Speaker 1>go in there,</v>

48
00:01:10.311 --> 00:01:15.080
<v Speaker 1>extract all the labs and just have him say the the jokes and have no response</v>

49
00:01:15.081 --> 00:01:17.000
<v Speaker 1>and see how fucking bizarre</v>

50
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.610
<v Speaker 2>I want him to do that.</v>

51
00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:23.611
<v Speaker 2>Where every po you take the laughs out and then every punch line I just go Bam.</v>

52
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.770
<v Speaker 1>See like curb your enthusiasm has no laugh track.</v>

53
00:01:29.771 --> 00:01:30.280
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

54
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.150
<v Speaker 1>And it's hilarious.</v>

55
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.270
<v Speaker 1>But if you did that with a show like two and a half men take out all the laughs.</v>

56
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.671
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

57
00:01:36.671 --> 00:01:38.710
<v Speaker 1>And only have them act out the scene.</v>

58
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.190
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking preposterous.</v>

59
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.050
<v Speaker 1>But having said that,</v>

60
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.501
<v Speaker 1>cheers.</v>

61
00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:41.891
<v Speaker 1>Had a laugh,</v>

62
00:01:41.891 --> 00:01:42.870
<v Speaker 1>track sign photo,</v>

63
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.800
<v Speaker 1>the laugh track friends had a laugh track.</v>

64
00:01:44.801 --> 00:01:44.951
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

65
00:01:44.951 --> 00:01:46.390
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing wrong with a laugh track.</v>

66
00:01:46.391 --> 00:01:48.460
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is when something's really horrible.</v>

67
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.731
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

68
00:01:48.731 --> 00:01:49.840
<v Speaker 1>And then you're just faking it.</v>

69
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

70
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.771
<v Speaker 1>And when,</v>

71
00:01:50.771 --> 00:01:52.990
<v Speaker 1>if you could just listen to it without the laughter,</v>

72
00:01:52.991 --> 00:01:53.824
<v Speaker 1>it would be so</v>

73
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.560
<v Speaker 2>that's like that movie that looks like,</v>

74
00:01:56.561 --> 00:01:57.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

75
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.730
<v Speaker 2>the movie with them.</v>

76
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.460
<v Speaker 2>I always forget the guy's name,</v>

77
00:02:00.461 --> 00:02:04.090
<v Speaker 2>the guy from who hosted the Oscars and he's handsome.</v>

78
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.530
<v Speaker 2>He wrestled rolling</v>

79
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.003
<v Speaker 2>steel,</v>

80
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.540
<v Speaker 2>steel robot boxers.</v>

81
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.710
<v Speaker 2>That looks good.</v>

82
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.340
<v Speaker 2>That is it.</v>

83
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.420
<v Speaker 2>I think it looks awesome.</v>

84
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.090
<v Speaker 2>It's like boxing match.</v>

85
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.290
<v Speaker 2>It's like a boxing the deck.</v>

86
00:02:17.291 --> 00:02:18.930
<v Speaker 2>Rocky mixed the transformer.</v>

87
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.430

88
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

89
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.240
<v Speaker 2>Rosio at first I thought it was a knock.</v>

93
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.210
<v Speaker 2>And that's pretty much what it is.</v>

94
00:02:28.211 --> 00:02:28.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

95
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.560
<v Speaker 2>I thought it looked good.</v>

96
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.220
<v Speaker 2>Just cause I liked that.</v>

97
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.150
<v Speaker 2>Just transformers.</v>

98
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.740
<v Speaker 2>Hugh Jackman shirtless in the real steel trailer at jam.</v>

99
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.610
<v Speaker 2>I want to see that bastard.</v>

100
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:38.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm a nerd.</v>

101
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.320
<v Speaker 1>You fucking ruined the Wolverine Character,</v>

102
00:02:40.321 --> 00:02:40.591
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

103
00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:41.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what anybody says.</v>

104
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.650
<v Speaker 1>Wolverine supposed to be like five foot three and built like a,</v>

105
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.270
<v Speaker 2>I find those movies pitiful.</v>

106
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.081
<v Speaker 2>I find the odd,</v>

107
00:02:48.081 --> 00:02:50.270
<v Speaker 2>the fact that they can only do superhero movies now,</v>

108
00:02:50.271 --> 00:02:50.851
<v Speaker 2>just pitiful.</v>

109
00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:51.890
<v Speaker 2>Like it's there.</v>

110
00:02:51.891 --> 00:02:52.220
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

111
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.881
<v Speaker 2>I told someone,</v>

112
00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:53.714
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

113
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.220
<v Speaker 2>it's there for dumb people to be able to explain to other dumb people.</v>

114
00:02:58.221 --> 00:03:03.221
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a dude and he got bit by a spider and he's half and half man.</v>

115
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 2>And he wears a uniform.</v>

116
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:08.440
<v Speaker 2>So you're never confused about who's who.</v>

117
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 2>And he's got a logo on the superman,</v>

118
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:14.230
<v Speaker 2>has a logo on the front and the back in case you get them.</v>

119
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.170
<v Speaker 2>You're telling me you don't like comic book movies,</v>

120
00:03:17.171 --> 00:03:17.590
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

121
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.800
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

122
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.440
<v Speaker 2>I liked,</v>

123
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm such an old man.</v>

124
00:03:19.371 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 2>I liked the Chris Reeve.</v>

125
00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:21.124
<v Speaker 2>Superman.</v>

126
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:22.310
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I didn't like x men.</v>

324
00:07:54.961 --> 00:07:56.370
<v Speaker 2>where they've reopened it,</v>

325
00:07:56.371 --> 00:07:57.270

<v Speaker 1>It's just a,</v>

328
00:08:00.141 --> 00:08:00.631

338
00:08:08.371 --> 00:08:09.570
<v Speaker 1>Once you commit to something,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to quit something once you're rolling.</v>

342
00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:15.480
<v Speaker 1>Admit that it's,</v>

345
00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.900
<v Speaker 1>the term is motivated reasoning where you just go,</v>

346

349
00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.380
<v Speaker 1>the whole reason you're saying is because you want it to be good.</v>

350
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.870
<v Speaker 1>You can also tell by people's Pitch,</v>

351
00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.500
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>
