13
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:30.010
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to get in touch with their feminine femininity.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They are.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

31
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:52.651
<v Speaker 1>even if you agree with me,</v>

32
00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:53.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm an idiot.</v>

33
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.000
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

34
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.870
<v Speaker 1>listen to this band before you today as men committed to becoming more conscious</v>

35
00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.790
<v Speaker 1>from every way we feel.</v>

36
00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:00.630
<v Speaker 1>Deep love,</v>

37

<v Speaker 1>and a growing.</v>

39
00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:02.971
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

40
00:01:02.971 --> 00:01:03.840
<v Speaker 1>the man talking.</v>

41
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.730
<v Speaker 1>His name is gay Hendricks.</v>

42
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.800
<v Speaker 1>We also feel deep sorrow about the destructive actions of the unconscious</v>

43
00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:12.810
<v Speaker 1>masculine in the past and present.</v>

44
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.910
<v Speaker 1>We want to apologize and make amends for those actions today so that we can move</v>

45
00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:21.210
<v Speaker 1>forward together into a new era of the pink spoon.</v>

46
00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:22.044
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know what that has?</v>

48
00:01:23.971 --> 00:01:24.804
<v Speaker 1>It's a foundation.</v>

49
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.681
<v Speaker 1>They're calm,</v>

50
00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:26.514
<v Speaker 1>they're enlightened.</v>

51
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.791
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

52
00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:31.791
<v Speaker 1>Listen to the music and then she listens to me in you in order of life.</v>

53
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.870
<v Speaker 1>I know that we all have access to the full spectrum of these energies.</v>

54
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:37.800
<v Speaker 1>If you see this guy,</v>

55
00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:40.330
<v Speaker 1>you realize how fucking creepy this sounds like your wellness.</v>

56
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.680
<v Speaker 1>There's gotta be a firewall for skittles commodities.</v>

57
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.090
<v Speaker 1>I admit it.</v>

58
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.550
<v Speaker 1>I can only think about Kevin ribbon or living in month.</v>

59
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.140
<v Speaker 1>I can work with mass with the music I play with it.</v>

60
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.463
<v Speaker 1>Look at these.</v>

61
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:53.431

<v Speaker 1>I know that in order to truly honor you as a multidimensional,</v>

63
00:01:56.761 --> 00:02:00.570
<v Speaker 1>a woman and Lust and fully present and oh and the gifts,</v>

65
00:02:06.121 --> 00:02:06.954
<v Speaker 1>conscious way.</v>

66

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.730
<v Speaker 1>and by worshiping that affinity expressed with the masculine and feminine</v>

69
00:02:14.731 --> 00:02:15.540
<v Speaker 1>energies,</v>

72
00:02:19.981 --> 00:02:20.880
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>

73
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.140
<v Speaker 1>I feel so these all look like people that went to a camp to pray the gay away</v>

74
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.040

81
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.600
<v Speaker 1>women burning at the cross.</v>

85
00:02:41.941 --> 00:02:43.230
<v Speaker 1>The crossing was explained,</v>

86
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.720
<v Speaker 1>relegated you to subservient chores,</v>

87
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.490
<v Speaker 1>forced you have to hide your faces and even cut off your organs of sexual</v>

88
00:02:50.491 --> 00:02:52.310
<v Speaker 1>pleasure that are</v>

89
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.010
<v Speaker 1>extreme that I'm aware of.</v>

90
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.060
<v Speaker 1>The forces of the unconscious masculine psyche powered by</v>

91
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.600
<v Speaker 1>masculine psyche.</v>

92
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Many of the men who have a,</v>

93
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.850
<v Speaker 1>this guy's mashing like psyche and its mouth among the living.</v>

94
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Many men may not be able to apologize because they remain shock.</v>

95
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Holden in a prison of anger,</v>

101
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.580

102
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.670
<v Speaker 1>scared glip,</v>

103
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.510
<v Speaker 1>it destructive forces in our psyche and I choose to no longer contribute to</v>

104
00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:29.344
<v Speaker 1>those forces.</v>

105
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.760
<v Speaker 1>I just noticed room smells like it's wooden paneled and somebody tears in.</v>

106
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.340
<v Speaker 1>She smells like faggotry.</v>

107
00:03:34.341 --> 00:03:36.140
<v Speaker 1>It's not poker player guide.</v>

108
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.053
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

109
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.820
<v Speaker 1>I think knowledge is this the most ridiculous shit ever.</v>

110
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.260
<v Speaker 1>A thousand years I've been mainly founded by this guy who propagated by men.</v>

111
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.780
<v Speaker 1>We've often acted as if he got Brody,</v>

112
00:03:46.781 --> 00:03:47.350
<v Speaker 1>Stevens,</v>

113

<v Speaker 1>This has got,</v>

116
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.110
<v Speaker 1>but in his right to a Trump circle there's this big contest and he just got done</v>

117
00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:56.944
<v Speaker 1>selling meth,</v>

118
00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.780
<v Speaker 1>inclusive spirituality</v>

119
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.790
<v Speaker 1>to honoring the state away to do the hard limb.</v>

120
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.470
<v Speaker 1>I honor your deep connection to the earth as man.</v>

121
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

122
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.511
<v Speaker 1>so I hadn't any.</v>

123
00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Now is that the point?</v>

124
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.181
<v Speaker 1>All of these guys,</v>

125
00:04:12.181 --> 00:04:13.680
<v Speaker 1>it just crawled back into my stomach.</v>

126
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.270
<v Speaker 1>All you guys are willing to roofie you domination.</v>

127
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.640
<v Speaker 1>Mistakenly believed that expansion who protect us from encroachment and in the</v>

128
00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:24.370
<v Speaker 1>process we violated the sanctity of the years.</v>

129
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.463
<v Speaker 1>I can't even watch it.</v>

130
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:27.600
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

131
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.060
<v Speaker 1>I understand that they have good intentions and I'm sure they're not really</v>

132
00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:30.894
<v Speaker 1>rapists,</v>

133
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:31.980
<v Speaker 1>but you got to understand folks,</v>

134
00:04:31.981 --> 00:04:36.981
<v Speaker 1>you're all what we would classify as weak ass bitches and that's why you're</v>

135
00:04:37.021 --> 00:04:40.290
<v Speaker 1>feeling this way and that's why you're feeling like you need to go out and save</v>

136
00:04:40.291 --> 00:04:42.240
<v Speaker 1>the world and make these women look.</v>

137
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.140
<v Speaker 1>Women are going to be fine.</v>

138
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

139
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.730

<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

141
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.540

142
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.640
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to look cool.</v>

143
00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:48.474
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to,</v>

144
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.900
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to get really broken women to like them.</v>

145
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.120
<v Speaker 1>You know the kind of women that look,</v>

146
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.230
<v Speaker 1>they can't attract them.</v>

147
00:04:55.231 --> 00:04:56.070
<v Speaker 1>They're not interesting.</v>

148
00:04:56.071 --> 00:04:57.180
<v Speaker 1>They're probably not successful.</v>

149
00:04:57.181 --> 00:04:58.014
<v Speaker 1>They're not intelligent,</v>

150
00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.760
<v Speaker 1>they're not swole,</v>

151
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.590
<v Speaker 1>they're not sexually attractive.</v>

152
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.030
<v Speaker 1>They probably have nothing going on.</v>

153
00:05:03.031 --> 00:05:06.390
<v Speaker 1>No one's cost puts them in a diaper in a cage and whip them.</v>

154
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think of that.</v>

155
00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.370
<v Speaker 1>That would be too exciting.</v>

156
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.810
<v Speaker 1>They have less than that and they,</v>

157
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.471
<v Speaker 1>I think to have that,</v>

158
00:05:10.471 --> 00:05:12.030
<v Speaker 1>I think that pay for that out the nose.</v>

159
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.040
<v Speaker 1>I think you just fucking speculating at this point.</v>

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.680
<v Speaker 1>But what they are is weekends pitches and we don't need that.</v>
